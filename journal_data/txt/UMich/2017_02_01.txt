Throughout his campaign, 

President 
Donald 
Trump 

promised to limit immigration 
from Muslim countries, but 
nothing could prepare LSA 
senior Tina Al-khersan for the 
phone call she received at 2:30 
a.m. Sunday.

Al-khersan’s sister, a citizen 

of the United States, Iraq 
and 
New 
Zealand, 

called 
because 
she 

was detained at the 
Canadian 
border 

while 
trying 
to 

come 
back 
home 

after a trip with her 
boyfriend. 
American 

border patrol officials 
searched her car and 
phone, and told her 
they 
weren’t 
quite 

sure what to do with 
her, 
implementing 

Trump’s immigration 
restrictions 
was 

above their paygrade. 
After 
four 
hours, 

Al-khersan’s 
sister 

demanded to be let in, 
using her knowledge 
as 
an 
immigration 

lawyer to her benefit.

“I don’t even want 

to 
speculate 
what 

would’ve 
happened 

if she didn’t know her rights,” 
Al-khersan said. “She’s a U.S. 
citizen; they were only treating 
her differently because her 
passport said she was born in 
Iraq.”

Al-khersan’s family is one 

of innumerable citizens, green 
card 
holders, 
visa 
holders 

and refugees who have been 
affected by Trump’s executive 
order tightening restrictions 
on immigration from seven 
Muslim 
countries, 
halting 

refugee 
immigration 
for 

120 days and barring Syrian 
refugees indefinitely.

President Trump said in a 

statement Sunday his goal is to 
keep Americans safe, not to ban 
Muslims, as some critics assert.

“America is a proud nation 

of immigrants and we will 
continue to show compassion 
to those fleeing oppression, but 
we will do so while protecting 
our own citizens and border,” 
Trump wrote. “To be clear, 

this is not a Muslim ban, as the 
media is falsely reporting. This 
is not about religion — this is 
about terror and keeping our 
country safe.”

However, 
Michigan 

representatives 
wrote 
in 

a 
statement 
by 
banning 

admissions 
and 
visas 
from 

exclusively 
Muslim-majority 

countries, the order is clearly 
religious 
discrimination. 

Out of all of the national 

rankings 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan makes each year, a new 
project could shake things up: The 
University, they say, is “number 
one” at number one.

Last 
week, 
University 

researchers 
contributed 
to 
a 

project some dub “peecycling,” 
installing a toilet and a urinal 
in the G.G. Brown Engineering 
building on North Campus that 
recycles human urine to fertilizer. 
 

The initiative, funded by a $3 

million grantfrom the National 
Science 
Foundation, 
created 

a split-bowl toilet design that 
collects urine from the toilet in a 
tank. The urine is then treated and 
filtered to be used as a fertilizer 
in 
the 
University’s 
botanical 

gardens. Solid waste from the 
toilet is sent to a treatment plant. 

From a user’s perspective, 

researchers said, the split-bowl 
toilet is not much different than 
a traditional toilet. Anthropology

“We are underdogs right now,

Central Student Government 

passed a resolution to adopt a 
student fee to increase funding 
for the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship at its weekly meeting 
on Tuesday. The resolution passed 
with 29 in favor and two opposed.

The Leadership Engagement 

Scholarship reduces the burden 
of financial strain for potential 
student 
leaders 
who 
aspire 

to contribute to any area of 
extracurricular campus life.

The 
scholarship 
also 

seeks 
specifically 
to 
reduce 

socioeconomic barriers faced by 
many students who must forgo 
valuable opportunities because of 
financial strain. The nature of the 
scholarship, and its intention to aid 
student leaders with demonstrated 
financial need, is in accordance 
with the University of Michigan’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic plan.

Many 
members 
of 
CSG 

expressed 
support 
for 
the 

resolution, noting that financial 
barriers affect many on campus, 
even if these students are not 
widely represented within CSG 
itself. 

CSG Communications Director 

Joe Shea, a Public Policy senior, has 
been a proponent of the resolution 
since its introduction. He said he 
supported it for its dedication to 
increased student involvement on 
the part of those who may struggle 
to access opportunities on campus.

“The idea behind this resolution 

is one of solidarity,” Shea said. 
“As students, we understand how 
expensive it is just to go here … 
I try to remember that for some 
people at this university, it is simply 
not possible, and that is where 
something like the Leadership 
Engagement Scholarship comes 
into play.”

tabled during last week’s Central 
Student 
Government 
meeting

University president discusses U-M’s responses to various issues, initiatives

On 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 

Mark Schlissel, president of the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
met 

with The Michigan Daily to 
address issues surrounding the 
University’s response to changes 
in national immigration policies, 
as well as its Poverty Solutions 
initiative 
and 
socioeconomic 

diversity on campus.

Changes 
in 
Immigration 

Policies and Statement

On 
Saturday, 
Schlissel 

released a statement proclaiming 
the 
University’s 
refusal 
to 

disclose students’ immigration 
information 
in 
response 
to 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

executive 
order 
banning 
the 

immigration 
of 
people 
from 

Muslim-majority countries.

The statement notes that the 

University has been a longtime 
advocate 
of 
international 

enrollment — the policy around 
students’ immigration statuses 
has been in place for months 
— and that it is “committed 

to protecting the rights and 
opportunities currently available” 
to community members.

Tuesday, Schlissel said he felt 

it was necessary to remind the 
community of the University’s 
stance, given the national political 
climate and concerned students 
on campus.

“These are very important 

basic 
long-held 
principles 
of 

the University, and I think it 
was an important moment to … 
reaffirm our values and reassure 
your fellow students of our 
longstanding policy,” he said.

He added a primary reason 

for the statement was to draw 
attention 
to 
the 
importance 

of 
international 
community 

members: faculty and staff, he 
clarified, will be afforded the 
same protections as international 
students.

“The reason I really wanted 

to speak up with clarity is I don’t 
necessarily think many people 
appreciate how international — 
not just our university — but all 
the great universities are,” he 
said. “We have students from

Ways to assist low-achieving students also discussed in psychology talk

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Oh deer! Tuesday morning, 

Cynthia Westphal, wife of City 

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 

(D–Ward 2), hit two deer on Fox 

Hunt Drive while driving her 

two sons — ages 8 and 10 — to 

school.

Fox Hunt Drive is close to 

King Elementary School in the 

northeast section of Ann Arbor.

Kirk Westphal shared in a 

Facebook post that his wife was 

only driving 10 mph, so the deer 

were unharmed by the collision. 

He said they ran out into the 

road and bounced off the front 

of the car before running off 

into the woods.

“She was driving 10 mph 

in the snow,” Westphal wrote. 

“One bounced off the front 

bumper, the other jumped and 

tripped over the roof. The deer 

ran off.”

Westphal, who was not in 

the car at the time of the crash, 

added there was no damage 

to the car aside from some fur 

being left in the door jamb.

“Amazingly, some fur in the 

door jamb 

is the only 

physical 

sign of what 

happened,” 

he wrote.

Westphal 

has voted 

in favor of 

controlling Ann 

Arbor’s deer 

population, 

specifically the 

cull of 63 deer 

last year, and he 

has used the 40 

to 50 residents 

who kill deer 

with their cars 

each year as 

a supporting 

element of his 

argument.

Michigan 

State police reported a notable jump 

in deer killed by cars in Ann Arbor 

in 2015, a 76 percent increase from 

2014. Data for 2016 has not yet been 

released.

Psychology Prof. Fred Morrison 

presented what he believes to be 
the predictors of success in school 
and ways to help low-achieving 
students improve performance 
during a University of Michigan 
psychology talk Tuesday night at 
the Ann Arbor Public Library.

Morrison discussed past studies 

supporting his claims, which show 
variability in performance from 
a young age and how to respond 
to those findings, including what 
can aid development, inside and 
outside school.

“What we’ve learned, I think, 

over the past 15 to 20 years is that 
basically American students show 
great variability in their language, 
cognitive, social, academic and 
related skills,” Morrison said. 
“That predicts their success in 
school.”

Morrison 
focused 
on 
self-

regulation and the importance 
of it in children. He defined self-
regulation as children’s ability 
to inhibit appropriate responses, 
including self-control and self-
management.

“We focus on reading, writing 

and arithmetic, but in most 
instances we really don’t focus 
on things like self-regulation,” 
Morrison 
said. 
“They’re 

supposedly learned on their own 
or maybe not learned on their own 
or they mature. But they really 
don’t see them as the object of 
instruction.”

The variability of self-regulation 

can be seen across gender and 
national origin. There are a group 
of boys in the United States who 
have been found to be lagging 
behind developmentally in terms 
of self-regulation. Morrison said 
this was the group that we needed 
to worry about.

Rackham 
student 
Sammy 

Ahmed said these findings could 

impact children both in school and 
at home.

“There could be implications 

for the timing and growth of these 
skills,” Ahmed said. “Some of the 
things that parents can do early on 
before school even begins that can 
give them an edge when they begin 
school,” 

The presentation focused on 

how to help the students who 
start school later, which is often 
indicator of success in the future. 
To find what students needed, 
Morrison said, researchers needed 
to examine what teachers were 
already doing.

“What we found essentially 

here is an example of how different 
kids need different kinds of 
instruction,” Morrison said.

Depending on ones’ IQ, students 

either needed more teacher-led 
instruction if they were on the 
lower side of the spectrum, or 
more personally driven activities if 
students were on the higher side of 

the spectrum.

To bring these findings 

into practice, Carol Connor of 
Arizona State University has 
developed an algorithm-based 
intervention 
program 
that 

computes the attention and 
activities each student needs.

“In essence, you have sub-

groups of kids (in a classroom), 
somewhere 
around 
three 

or four sub-groups, that are 
clustered by their patterns of 
scores and then the computer 
program will actually generate 
the exact amount and types 
of instruction that that child 
needs to get in order to be at 
grade level,” Morrison said.

Ann Arbor resident Carlene 

Colvin-Garcia said she hopes 
that the findings discussed by 
Morrison will be implemented 
in the school systems.

“I’m really interested in 

the emerging philosophy and 
methodologies for education,” 
Colvin-Garcia said.

HALEY MCLAUGHLIN/Daily

American Culture professor Philip Deloria and Political Science professor Lisa Ditch discuss the film “This Changes Everything” at a panel 
after a viewing of the film in Rackham on Tuesday. 

“THIS CHANGES EVE RY THING”

Many of these representatives 
are working with more than 
160 colleagues in the House of 
Representatives 
to 
introduce 

legislation that would defund 
Trump’s executive order.

“By seeking to halt all refugee 

admissions in the short term, 
and slash the number of refugee 
admissions to a modern historic 
low, today’s order betrays our 
proud heritage as a Nation of 
immigrants and a place of refuge,” 
the representatives wrote.

Engineering freshman Lincoln 

Merrill, publicity chair of the 
University of Michigan’s chapter 
of College Republicans, reiterated 
that while many people have 
labeled the order a “Muslim ban,” 
the title ignores many Muslim 
countries that were not affected.

“To be clear, President Trump’s 

immigration 
order 
is 
not 
a 

‘Muslim ban,’ nor is it a ban on 
anyone or anything,” Merrill said. 
“If the people calling this order a 
‘Muslim ban’ were correct, that 
would imply that immigration 
from around 50 Muslim-majority 
countries would be terminated 
and that a religious test would 
be implemented to enter the 
country.”

Al-khersan 
pushed 
back 

against claims that America’s 
highest risk comes from “terror-
prone” regions.

“The U.S. already has the 

strictest vetting process,” she 
said. “If we really wanted to talk 
about protecting our citizens, we 
would have to look within them.”

LSA senior Adam Mageed, 

president 
of 
the 
campus 

Muslim Coalition, agreed with 
Al-khersan, and said this policy 
ignores refugees whose lives 
could be in greater danger.

“I think that Americans are 

incredibly safe and take their 
safety for granted,” Mageed said. 
“Security at the cost of heavy 
discrimination isn’t security.”

However, College Republicans 

president Enrique Zalamea, an 
LSA junior, maintained that no 
matter how unlikely terrorist 
attacks may be, the government’s 
duty is to uphold security.

“I 
am 
a 
first-generation 

American, and I love this country, 
but I would rather have a more 
secure immigration process in 
order to reduce the risk of future 
terrorist threats,” Zalamea said. 
“It truly bewilders me to see so 
many people protesting what is 
essentially a vital step towards 
proving our national security.”

Still, LSA junior Haleemah 

Aqel thinks more consideration 
should be given to the refugees 
affected. Aqel leads the Books 
Not Bombs campaign, which 
advocates for admitting Syrian 
refugees to the University.

“There’s 
an 
idea 
that 

Americans are at the highest 
risk, but more Muslims are killed 
from terrorist groups,” Aqel said. 
“They’re the ones that need to 
flee and that need to be kept safe. 
They need to flee, we don’t need 
to isolate.”

LSA junior Taiwo Dosunmu, 

communications director of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, agreed and said the 
United States already has an 
“incredibly thorough” vetting 
process in place, and making it 
even stricter could have adverse 
effects.

“For a would-be terrorist 

trying to sneak into the U.S., 
the refugee program is probably 
the most difficult possible way 
to enter the country,” Dosunmu 
said. “In fact, the ban may make 
us less safe as it sends a clear 
message to persecuted people 
around the world that the 
United States no longer stands 
by them.”

Aqel 
said 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
recent 

executive orders ignore the 
intersectionality 
of 
multiple 

policies’ effects on the Muslim 
community.

“There are Muslims who use 

Planned Parenthood and pay for 
it through (Affordable Care Act) 
insurance,” Aqel said. “There are 
Latina Muslims that are affected, 
as they are being kept from our 
country because of a ban and 
because of the prospects of a wall. 
Right now we are thinking that 
these things are separate, but 
they are really just piling on top 
of each other.”

Implications of the order on 

international 
relations 
worry 

students as well. Al-khersan 
noted that with Russia and 
Iran 
supporting 
the 
Syrian 

government, the dynamics of 
the Syrian war could change 
drastically under the Trump 
administration.

American Culture Prof. Evelyn 

Alsultany expressed concern for 
the potentially negative treatment 
of 
Americans 
abroad 
and 

mentioned a worrisome prospect: 
adverse to the policy’s goal, the 
immigrations restrictions could 
aid ISIS’s mission.

Alsultany 
fields 
concerns 

from multiple students as to 
whether 
their 
families 
will 

be able to visit them, and 
expressed doubts in regards to 
the effectiveness of this policy 
domestically.

“I think in terms of fighting 

terrorism, 
clearly 
targeting 

seven entire nations isn’t going 
to solve a terrorism problem,” 
Alsultany said. “Beyond that, 
our politicians have been citing 
the 9/11 attack, the Boston 
bombing and the San Bernardino 
terrorism 
attack, 
but 
this 

particular policy wouldn’t have 
prevented any of those. Many 
of the terrorists from 9/11 came 
from Saudi Arabia, and Saudi 

Arabia isn’t a part of this ban. It 
seems very arbitrary.”

Mageed 
also 
noted 
that 

academic issues, including those 
pertinent to the University, 
could be at risk because the ban 
prevents 
Iranian 
academics 

from seeking asylum in the 
United States after expressing 
sociopolitical 
views 
not 

condoned in Iran.

Alsultany 
expressed 

gratitude 
toward 
the 

University’s resistance to the 
policy, and expressed hope that 
the campus would remain a safe 
and open place for all students. 
Al-khersan 
also 
emphasized 

action.

“Don’t think we’re going to 

be quieted,” Al-khersan said. 
“I’ve never seen the Muslim 
populations from all around the 
globe unite like this.”

over 100 countries around the 
globe. The idea of excluding a 
significant fraction of the world 
as being potential members of our 
community, I think would hurt 
us.” 

The 
statement 
notes 
that 

information 
on 
immigration 

status will be kept private unless 
“required 
to 
(comply 
with 

enforcement agencies) by law.”

Schlissel said he could not 

speak to the possible ways in 
which this information could 
be required or the University’s 
possible compliance.

“Like 
the 
whole 
nation, 

we’re following very carefully 
things that are changing quite 
quickly, they change by the hour 
sometimes,” he said. “We have a 
staff keeping very close watch so 
that we know what the situation is 
and we can best advise members 
of our community.”

Schlissel was not able to 

comment regarding a specific plan 
for students with refugee status, 
as a widely circulated student 
petition 
calls 
for. 
University 

spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
provided a general statement later 
Tuesday evening noting a newly-
organized immigration working 
group would be better suited to 
respond to such issues. 

“The group had its first meeting 

last week, and we will update 
the 
community 
when 
more 

information becomes available,” 
she wrote in an email. 

Schlissel noted the University’s 

affiliation 
with 
national 

organizations — like the Association 
of American Universities, which 
former University president Mary 
Sue Coleman now heads — to 
share approaches to addressing 
such problems. Coleman issued 
a statement Saturday urging the 
Trump administration to suspend 
the executive order. 

“We recognize the importance of 

a strong visa process to our nation’s 
security,” she said. “However, the 
administration’s new order barring 
the entry or return of individuals 
from certain countries is already 
causing damage and should end as 
quickly as possible.”

Poverty Solutions
Poverty 
Solutions, 
a 

multidisciplinary 
program 

that uses research to aid low-
income families, was announced 
in October. In early January, a 
Facebook Live event was held in 
which panelists discussed the 
initiative.

In response to the University’s 

financial support of the project, 
Schlissel 
explained 
that 
all 

University 
contributions 
are 

consistent with its research goals.

“We only spend money on 

the 
University’s 
mission; 
it’s 

not as if we’re spending money 
directly on impoverished people 
in their everyday lives,” he said. 
“What we’re spending money 
on is supporting our researchers 
and our students who are doing 

research and teaching in this 
area.”

Schlissel acknowledged it is 

important to understand that, 
in doing this research, people’s 
lives are affected. He said without 
community engagement, it would 
not be right for the University 
to enter these areas and make 
assumptions about what people 
may or may not need. 

Schlissel said one of the most 

positive aspects of this program 
is partnering with community 
groups and working with citizens 
in impoverished communities to 
try to apply and test ideas. He said 
the modest amount of money given 
to the program allows for this 
engagement with the community.

“What has me very excited 

about this initiative is it involves 
very close partnerships between 
experts in many different schools 
and colleges here, students, and 
then community groups that 
actually have the knowledge and 
their hands around the problem in 
a very real and local way,” he said.

Socioeconomic Diversity
Though Schlissel is in the 

process of implementing several 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
initiatives, 
a 
report 
from 

the 
Equality 
of 
Opportunity 

Project gave the University an 
incredibly low ranking in terms 
of socioeconomic diversity and 
mobility.

The New York Times’ Upshot 

noted the report’s finding that 
66 percent of students at the 
University come from the top 20 

percent of the income distribution, 
while only 3.6 percent come from 
the bottom 20 percent.

Schlissel 
said 
he 
was 

disappointed in these numbers, 
but not surprised.

“We’ve identified this as a 

problem in recent years,” he said. 
“It’s not trending in the right 
direction and we’re serious about 
reversing it.”

Schlissel pointed to the success 

of the HAIL Scholars Program, 
now in its second year, which 
brought more than 250 low-
income, largely first-generation 
students into last year’s freshman 
class.

The University also helped 

establish the American Talent 
Initiative, a program involving 
several 
higher 
education 

institutions that are working 
to increase the number of 
talented, low-income students. 

“We’re 
making 
a 

commitment to bring to our 
campus 
top 
students 
from 

lower socioeconomic groups,” 
he said. “We’ve set rough target 
goals nationally to increase this 
number by a couple hundred 
thousand per year … students 
from 
lower 
socioeconomic 

communities are very talented, 
but they’re not applying to 
the same schools, or school 
at all sometimes, as similarly 
talented students in wealthier 
areas. They’re aiming low. The 
goal of this talent initiative is 
to identify that talent and help 
them aim high.”

learning in his courses to help 
student organizations.

“I really wanted to leverage 

the things that I am learning in 
class to help organizations … that 
maybe don’t have as many people 
interested in business,” Small 
said. “But in every organization, 
there are business aspects to it.”

The Business School already 

boasts 
numerous 
consulting 

groups such as Nexecon, 180 
Degrees and BOND Consulting, 
all extremely selective in whom 
they admit and consult, primarily 
focusing on local businesses and 
nonprofits. Capital Consulting 
executive board members feel 
their organization differentiates 
itself from those groups. Capital 
is betting that its startup mindset, 
executive board membership of 
diverse backgrounds and desire 
to prove itself as a formidable 
club will help it establish itself 
as a viable consulting group. Yu 
believes these factors distinguish 
Capital from other consulting 
groups with more experience, 
bigger staffs and lengthier client 
lists.

“Because we are a startup, I 

think it is less structured and 
there is more overlap in our 
roles, but that also means we 
have a lot more opportunities for 
our members,” Yu said. “Every 

member has the luxury of taking 
on an initiative if they think it is 
the right thing to do, instead of 
just following orders from who is 
above you.”

Establishing the club as a 

fast-growing presence in the 
Business School did not come 
without its challenges. Enlisting 
clients, recruiting consultants, 
narrowing down the list of 
candidates and developing a 
website all proved formidable 
tasks. Though Small is excited 
to begin working with clients 
such as Pierpont Commons, 
WCBN-FM and LEAD scholars, 
the previous months of helping 
Capital establish itself as an 
organization proved challenging.

“We had a meeting during 

exam week last semester and I 
was just sitting there like, ‘Guys, 
with where we are at right 
now, we weren’t left with many 
resources and we very reasonably 
might have to take a semester off,’ 
” he said. “We all looked at each 
other and were like, ‘Is this going 
to be it?’ ”

Yet, 
board 
members 

were determined to see the 
organization 
succeed. 
They 

worked throughout Winter Break 
to develop marketing material, 
redesign the website, prepare 
for recruitment and reach out to 
prospective clients. With their 
first consulting projects for the

would lead to tuition increase — 
will create a fee for all University 
of Michigan students equaling 
$5 per semester for the next five 
years. This contribution will total 
more than $2 million toward the 
scholarship, a sum of money that 
the resolution’s writers said would 
aid hundreds of students.

Engineering 
senior 
Tania 

Haddad, a writer of the resolution, 
echoed 
Shae’s 
sentiments, 

stating individual contributions 
would benefit the University 
in 
innumerable 
ways. 
She 

noted how the scholarship can 
be extended to innovation in 
extracurriculars such as Greek 
life, entrepreneurship endeavors, 
performing arts projects and 
student government initiatives.

“Leadership is very much a 

public good that we think everyone 
should contribute to, because it 
benefits all of us,” Haddad said. 
“All of the students who would be 
coming here the next five years 
would be helping student leaders 
and therefore helping themselves.”

Some 
members 
remained 

skeptical about the amendment, 
fearing that it would result in 
widespread 
tuition 
increases, 

despite the writers’ stating that 
tuition alterations fall under the 
responsibility of the Board of 
Regents, rather than the resolution 
itself.

Upon request by other members 

of the assembly for examples of the 
experiences of low socioeconomic 
students 
who 
have 
been 

compromised by their situations, 
many CSG members spoke up and 
cited incidents pertaining to the 
scholarship.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Joe 

Ambrose said he has known 
students 
who 
demonstrated 

interest in student government but 
did not apply because they could 
not commit so much time to an 
unpaid position.

Engineering 
senior 
Katie 

Culver 
mentioned 
similar 

instances in which her peers 
were unable to access resources 
provided 
by 
the 
University 

because of financial barriers, 
which she said could be aided with 
contributions to the Leadership 
Engagement Scholarship.

“I was at an information 

session for GM, and the woman 
said they want interns that are 
very involved on campus and in 
extracurriculars,” Culver said. 
“And one kid said, ‘I don’t have 
any internships, and I’m not very 
involved on campus, but can I still 
get this job?’ He said, ‘I work at 
Pizza Hut.’ And to the recruiters, 
it didn’t look very good, but what 
if he couldn’t afford to give up that 
job to be involved on campus?”

Besides 
limiting 
access 
to 

internships 
or 
job 
positions 

through the University, financial 
burdens 
also 
limit 
students’ 

access 
to 
scientific 
research. 

Haddad noted an instance in 
which potential researchers were 
unable to pursue important career 
opportunities due to the strains of 
unpaid time commitments.

“I know that a lot of my friends 

on engineering design teams can’t 
dedicate a full-time job’s worth 
of time on top of their classes, 
towards something that would 
benefit them in the future, when 
looking for internships, or full 
time-jobs, or just for the hands-on 
experience,” Haddad said. “That’s 
the exposure I’ve had, and why I’m 
passionate about the LES.”

Rackham student Rep. Andy 

Snow, who opposed the resolution 
when it was introduced last week, 
voted against it for a second time. 
He said he will never support a 
resolution that could potentially 
result in tuition increases.

“You can call it a fee, you 

can call it a tuition change, but 
either way it is an increase,” 
Snow said. “I want it on the 
record and this will absolutely 
increase what people will say, 
and I cannot be for it.”

CSG

Associate Prof. Rebecca Hardin, 
one of the project leaders, said 
there is almost no difference in 
user experience.

“At this point, the technology 

doesn’t look much different than a 
normal bathroom infrastructure,” 
she said.

Hardin 
led 
the 
project 

with Nancy Love and Krista 
Wigginton, 
both 
professors 

of 
civil 
and 
environmental 

engineering. 

The professors and researchers 

created many goals for the project. 
They hoped to utilize urine’s 
nutrients effectively to reduce 
water pollution, but also create a 
fertilizer that is safer than many 
synthetic fertilizers.

“We believe our work will take 

urine-derived fertilizer to a point 

where it’s safer than synthetic 
fertilizers and biosolids,” Love 
said in a Michigan News article. 

The launch of the new toilets 

coincided with the announcement 
of a survey analyzing users’ 
opinions on the new technology. 
The survey is presented on tablets 
in the bathroom toilet users can 
give immediate feedback. The 
team is working on “how to most 
effectively convey this technical 
information to the public to 
try to advance acceptance and 
instruction,” Love said. 

“None of this is going to go 

anywhere if people have negative 
impressions of this technology,” 
Love said.

By using the survey to gauge 

user experience and opinions 
about the new toilet technology, 
the leaders of the project plan to 
introduce these toilets in other 
regions of the United States.

“There will be many related 

types of surveys in the project as 

we expand uptake potential of 
the project in New England, the 
Upper Midwest and possibly a 
third area,” Hardin said.

Urine recycling first began 

in 
2014 
when 
researchers 

from the University’s School 
of Engineering, the School of 
Public Health and the School of 
Natural Resources collaborated 
with researchers from the Rich 
Earth Institute in Vermont and 
researchers from the University 
of Buffalo. Since then, the team 
examined and tested ways to filter 
urine to create an effective plant 
fertilizer.

“We had been doing trial runs 

where we took urine collected 
from festivals and events and 
then we used the collected urine 
and we’d been using them to apply 
to crops,” Love said. “During two 
seasons of field visits, we grew 
carrots and lettuce and tracked 
the way technology killed the 
bacteria and viruses.”

Since the launch of the new 

technology, 
researchers 
are 

recognizing 
the 
toilet 
could 

be a step in developing ways 
to 
promote 
sustainability 

on campus, especially as the 
University plans to launch the 
School for Environment and 
Sustainability in July. 

“One other exciting aspect is 

that it is kind of the harbinger 
of 
the 
times 
to 
come 
for 

sustainability 
on 
campus,” 

Hardin said. “In July, we will 
be launching the School for 
Sustainability and Environment, 
and that will foster more bridge 
building across units.” 

Love said she was appreciative 

of the University’s willingness to 
help with the project.

“It’s been interesting because 

on 
campus 
we’ve 
had 
no 

resistance, we’ve had extensive 
enthusiasm,” she said. “This is 
promising from the perspective of 
a campus.”

T

wo 
weekends 
ago, 
I 

went back home to Lake 
Orion, something I do 

every month. It’s nice to sleep in 
my own bed and spend time with 
my family, but I like 
Ann Arbor more than 
my hometown. Ann 
Arbor is more diverse 
(which is something 
that just about no one 
says) and I feel more 
comfortable 
here 

(for once I’m not the 
only Black girl in my 
class). If you have an 
obsession with lakes, 
like spending the day 
on a boat or like high-school 
football, then you’ll love spending 
time in Lake Orion. But if you’ve 
lived there for your entire life, 
aren’t impressed by lakes, aren’t 
interested in football and don’t 
understand the point of standing 
on a boat all day, then you’ll get 
bored quickly. Every time I get 
on the freeway in the direction of 
the small town I’ve lived in since I 
was a toddler, I think, “I should’ve 
stayed in Ann Arbor.”

There usually isn’t much to do 

besides go shopping or see a movie, 
but thankfully “Hidden Figures” 
was playing. When I first heard 
about this film, I knew I had to see 
it. The casting seemed incredible 
— my favorite actress Taraji P. 
Henson and my favorite singer 
Janelle Monae had major roles — 
and the film is centered around 
the lives of Black women, which is 
something I can relate to but have 
trouble finding in major films. A 
cast with minority female leads is 
rare in major Hollywood movies, 
which made “Hidden Figures” an 
important movie for my family to 
see. Additionally, the film focused 
on the contributions these women 
made to the Space Race and U.S. 
history, which is a topic I love and 
want to know more about.

I felt like I needed to see this 

movie in theaters, that it was my 
responsibility to make my family 
members watch it. A couple of 
weeks before I went home, I tried 
to organize a family outing to go 
see it, but that didn’t work out so 
well. So while my sister and dad 
stayed home, my mom and I went 
to see it. I expected the theater to 
be empty. “I really don’t think that 
many people from our town will 
see this movie,” I told my mom 
before we left.

The reason for this belief had 

nothing to do with the film itself, 
but the way I saw the community 
I lived in. Lake Orion’s slogan is 
“Where Living is a Vacation,” but 

in 2016 I nicknamed 
it “Trump Country” 
— a catch-all term to 
describe anything I 
don’t like about it. The 
nickname 
seemed 

appropriate: 
The 

people in my town 
who supported Trump 
were very vocal about 
it. Someone in my town 
hand-made a massive 
paper mâché Trump 

sign for their yard and almost every 
day in my macroeconomics class 
a kid would interrupt the lesson 
to talk about how great Trump 
was. But I never saw a “Stronger 
Together” sign on anyone’s yard 
and outside of my friend group, I 
never heard people defend Hillary 
Clinton or Bernie Sanders as 
strongly as they defended Trump.

I also got the sense that many 

people in my town were not 
comfortable with Black people. 
Maybe it was the stares that I or 
anyone in my family got any time 
we left our house, or maybe it was 
passing a car with a Confederate 
flag bumper sticker every day 
on my way into high school 
until my junior year, biking past 
trucks with massive Confederate 
flags attached to their backs or 
seeing people wear Confederate 
flag 
necklaces 
and 
T-shirts. 

Whenever I caught someone or a 
group staring at me or my family, 
whenever I saw an image of the 
stars and bars, it reaffirmed my 
belief that my hometown had no 
place for me or my family. Based 
on these events and experiences, I 
did not think that too many people 
in my town would be interested in 
seeing “Hidden Figures.”

But I was so wrong: The theater 

was packed. I looked back at my 
mom and gave her an expression 
of pure shock, then looked back 
at everyone in the theaters, then 
looked back at my mom again with 
the same shocked expression.

While I searched for a place to 

sit, I began to realize how skewed 
and unfair my characterization 
of Lake Orion was. I call my 
hometown “Trump Country,” but 
it actually isn’t — Hillary Clinton 
won the majority of votes in my 
county. Obviously, not every car 

in that town has the Confederate 
flag attached to it or on its bumper; 
I only remember the ones that 
did because they reinforced my 
belief that I didn’t belong and that 
my community could not accept 
me. It was difficult for me to see 
the positive aspects of my town 
because I spent so much time trying 
to craft scenarios that would get me 
out. Also, I’m a bit of a pessimist; I 
expect the worst in everything to 
avoid feeling disappointed. But I 
need to stop allowing perceived 
future disappointment to shape 
my perceptions — especially my 
perceptions of others. 

Once my mom and I sat down, 

I thought about what it meant to 
sit in the theater, surrounded by 
people who didn’t look like me but 
wanted to see a movie that dealt 
with race and the challenges Black 
women faced during the 1960s. It 
showed me that confronting issues 
of race is awkward, and at certain 
points during the film I could tell 
that people were uncomfortable. 
There were times when my mom 
and I, as well as the other few 
Black people in the audience, 
would laugh or shake our heads — 
but no one else in the audience did. 
Only a few people in the audience 
were in on all of the jokes while the 
majority did not understand what 
was so funny.

This mirrors aspects of the 

debates over topics such as the 
Black Lives Matter movement, 
immigration, 
women’s 
rights 

and LGBTQ rights. On one side, 
people cannot, or may not, be 
willing to understand the obstacles 
minorities and women encounter 
and why they feel threatened. For 
people on the other side, these 
obstacles are obvious and clearly 
need to be broken down. But for 
both sides to be united, each 
needs to confront — not avoid, 
dismiss or just talk about — the 
problems that exist. In addition, 
neither 
can 
allow 
negative 

preconceived notions to affect 
their expectations. Both sides 
need to act; that may take the 
form of learning about someone 
else’s experience or speaking up 
for your beliefs in classes or on the 
street during a protest. This may 
be uncomfortable or awkward, but 
it is necessary in combining two 
divided groups into one.

A

fter months of dread, 
you’d think we’d be 
prepared. Many of us 

played games in our head as we 
anticipated the coming Trump 
administration. What would 
he do? How would he do it? We 
worried about authoritarian 
and fascist tendencies. But 
how far could he really push 
it? Isn’t this America? At the 
very least, we hoped that a 
minimum requirement of lip 
service to American ideals and 
values would limit his ability to 
undermine the rights of those 
with claims upon American 
compassion and inclusion.

It’s worse than we feared. 
Most 
immediately, 
many 

of us are reeling from the 
weekend’s blanket travel ban 
applied to all refugees and to 
the citizens of seven majority-
Muslim countries, including 
Iraqis who had risked their 
lives to serve as interpreters for 
the U.S. military.

But here’s what’s keeping 

me up at night: the new 
administration’s statement on 
the occasion of International 
Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
What, you may ask, could be so 
disturbing about what should 
be a pro forma declaration 
about the horror of genocide, 
sympathy for the victims and 
assurances that we won’t let it 
happen again?

There is so much wrong with 

the 
Trump 
administration’s 

statement 
that 
it 
is 
hard 

to 
know 
where 
to 
start. 

Beyond 
imposing 
a 
travel 

ban on refugees on a day 
devoted to remembering the 
Holocaust, most attention has 
focused on the statement’s 
failure to mention Jews. The 
administration’s 
subsequent 

clarification that identifying 
the 
victims 
as 
“innocent 

people” 
was 
a 
way 
to 

acknowledge that other groups 
also suffered in the Holocaust 
only added fuel to the fire.

Trump’s 
remembrance 

statement spuriously goes on to 
claim that “in the darkest hours 
of humanity, light shines the 
brightest,” ignoring the reality, 

depicted in myriad memoirs 
and historical accounts, that 
the horror of the Holocaust was 
its accomplishment in blotting 
out light. There were of course 
manifold instances of heroism 
and 
unexpected 
humanity 

amid 
the 
destruction, 
but 

we remember the Holocaust 
because it demonstrated the 
kind of utter darkness that 
humans can bring.

Disturbing as all of this 

is, the true dark heart of 
this statement is found in its 
sickly sweet coda. Trump’s 
inaugural speech and active 
first week in office have been 
shockingly 
devoid 
of 
the 

aspirational call-outs to the 
American values of equality, 
progress and tolerance that 
have become part and parcel 
of these ritualized transitions 
of power. So, it’s almost jarring 
to see them emerge suddenly 
in the Holocaust remembrance 
statement. Yet, here they are in 
appropriate Trump fashion — 
bizarrely reduced to a comic-
book-level claim — that not only 
“throughout (his) Presidency,” 
but throughout his life, he will 
be on guard “to ensure that the 
forces of evil never again defeat 
the powers of good.”

Finally, the short statement’s 

concluding 
assertion 
that 

“Together, 
we 
will 
make 

love and tolerance prevalent 
throughout the world” comes 
like a punch in the gut. It 
is galling and unnerving in 
a way that transcends its 
insultingly banal saccharinity. 
As the Trump administration 
ended its first week in office, 

American airports became the 
scene of chaotic and sudden 
exclusions of hundreds, soon 
to be thousands, of individuals 
for whom there is no rational 
basis for exclusion, save clearly 
framed religious intolerance. 
This was revealed in Trump’s 
assurance 
that 
Christian 

refugees would receive priority 
consideration for exemption 
from the exclusions. 

In just one week, the president 

of the United States showed 
that he could not be relied upon 
even to decry the Holocaust. 
On 
International 
Holocaust 

Remembrance Day, the Trump 
administration demonstrated its 
utter inability to invoke credibly 
the actual or aspirational values 
we associate with our nation. It 
refused to acknowledge that the 
targeting and extermination of a 
specific group was the key to one 
of humanity’s darkest chapters, 
even while enacting a policy that 
specifically sets out to scapegoat 
and exclude Muslims.

Today, 
family 
members 

of those with green cards or 
visas do not know when or if 
they will see their loved ones. 
Refugees from horrific violence 
and those who risked their lives 
to assist the United States who 
thought they would at last be 
safe are once again confronting 
their 
utter 
vulnerability. 

Citizens of Victoria, Texas, are 
contemplating the burnt remains 
of their community’s mosque 
and millions of more privileged 
Americans are out protesting, 
deprived of sleep and wondering 
where we are headed.

With 
its 
intentional 

ignorance of the past and 
hypocritical 
deployment 
of 

American 
ideals, 
President 

Trump’s vaunted commitment 
to battling “the forces of evil” 
and ensuring the prevalence 
of “love and tolerance” should 
have us all running — to the 
library and to the barricades.

Trump should learn from Islam

IBRAHIM IJAZ | COLUMN

S

hortly after the inaugural 
address, the Obamas and 
the Trumps descended the 

steps of the Capitol building in a 
beautiful display of 
peaceful transitioning. 
Chills came over me 
as 
I 
remembered 

descending those very 
steps in the summer 
of 2012 as a part 
of 
another 
display 

of peace. I walked 
down the steps of the 
Capitol building in the 
company of my global 
religious leader, the 
Khalifa of Islam, following his 
address to bipartisan leaders 
regarding peace and justice. 
It strikes me as ironic that I 
walked with a prominent leader 
after a speech about peace, 
unity and justice, while Barack 
Obama walked that same path 
with a new leader after a speech 
evoking disunity and prejudice. 
I think our new president, 
Donald Trump, should take a 
page from Islam’s book to learn 
how to establish peace.

The main source of the 

disunity 
and 
prejudice 
in 

President Trump’s speech was 
the overwhelming presence of 
religion. “What happened to 
the separation of church and 
state?” my friends and I asked 
in an air of holy confusion. If 
you didn’t catch the religious 
overtones, 
here’s 
a 
recap. 

Half a dozen clergy members 
participated in the ceremony, 
bookending 
President 

Trump’s 
address. 
Two 
of 

the 
musical 
performances 

were religious groups: the 
Mormon 
Tabernacle 
Choir 

and the Washington National 
Cathedral Choir of Men, Boys 
and Girls. Numerous allusions 
to God or a creator were 
made in the speech. But most 
strikingly, the only time a non-
Judeo-Christian 
faith 
was 

mentioned was when he vowed 
to eradicate “radical Islamic 
terrorism … from the face of 
the Earth.”

The 
debate 
on 
labeling 

extremism 
committed 
by 

so-called Muslims as “radical 

Islamic terrorism” has, once 
again, become contentious in 
the days since the inauguration. 
One side alleges intrinsic issues 

within 
Islam 
that 

have led to the rise 
in 
extremism. 
The 

other 
side 
argues 

that terrorism knows 
no 
religion 
and 
is 

widespread throughout 
many 
faiths 
and 

nations. As such, it’s 
counterproductive 
to 

point to the religions 
of 
all 
extremists 

throughout 
history, 

especially when their religions 
denounce killing. One popular 
meme points to this cognitive 
dissonance by saying if rust 
is caused by oxygen, and we 
breathe oxygen every day, 
just imagine what it can do to 
your lungs.

The president’s allusion to 

Islam is a part of the greater 
issue 
of 
the 
Republican 

Party’s 
obsession 
with 

de-secularizing America. It’s 
one thing to slanderously 
mislabel Islam in front of 
the nation, further spreading 
prejudice about Muslims in 
America. But it’s an entirely 
larger issue to enjoy the free 
mixing of church and state 
during 
our 
nation’s 
most 

symbolic 
event. 
Thomas 

Jefferson once called this 
constitutional separation “a 
wall,” (not the kind Donald 
Trump would hope for), so 
it’s clear more secularization 
is required in order to attain 
peace.

Islam’s advice for attaining 

peace 
had 
16-year-old 
me 

awestruck when I attended 
the address of the Khalifa of 
Islam, Hazrat Mirza Masroor 
Ahmad, in 2012. The thesis of 
his argument was simply that 
Islam says, “Peace and justice 
are inseparable — you cannot 
have one without the other.” 
Due justice and all rights must 
be given between interacting 
parties to set the stage for 
sustainable peace. This is a 
lesson President Trump needs 
to learn. He should not continue 

to unjustly vilify Islam or 
exclude 
non-Judeo-Christian 

faiths from his administration. 
If he does so, he is paving 
the path for human rights 
violations and unjust dealings 
for marginalized groups in 
America and abroad during his 
four years.

He ought to make a decision. 

Mr. Trump can follow Thomas 
Jefferson and the Khalifa of 
Islam’s advice and build a 
wall between himself and the 
church, or he can continue 
down 
a 
segregated 
and 

theocratic 
path, 
on 
which 

Judeo-Christians walk on the 
pure and holy right and all 
other faiths occupy a forgotten 
left. If he chooses the latter, he 
must recall, as I often do, the 
words he told the nation on 
Nov. 9, 2016: “I pledge to every 
citizen of our land that I will be 
president for all Americans.”

Being 
a 
representative 

president for all Americans 
takes more than mere pledges 
of unity. I call on President 
Donald Trump to dismantle 
his 
policies 
that 
seek 
to 

institutionalize 
prejudice, 

namely 
the 
immigration 

ban. 
It’s 
the 
responsibility 

of Donald Trump to follow 
the Khalifa of Islam’s advice 
to 
American 
politicians 
to 

establish “absolute justice” in 
order to attain peace. Banning 
immigrants 
and 
refugees 

without legitimate cause is 
clearly unjust.

This 
begins 
with 
active 

inclusion, rather than exclusion. 
An old saying warns, “If you 
don’t have a seat at the table, 
you’re probably on the menu.” 
However, the first African-
American 
Congresswoman 

Shirley 
Chisholm 
offers 
us 

alternative 
advice: 
“Bring 

a folding chair.” And that’s 
exactly what all marginalized 
communities should do if 
we want to observe tolerant 
policies. Stand with me as

Wednesday, February 1, 2017 — 5A

D.R.A.M. is a master of none. 

Or, more accurately, he is a 
master of most: The twenty-eight 
year-old songwriter switches 
between singing, rapping and 
crooning with such fluency that 
it’s difficult to decide which 
sound most accurately defines 
his.

Since 
initially 
rising 
to 

fame through the success of 
his breakout hit “Cha Cha” — 
famously sampled for “Hotline 
Bling” — he’s ridden the 
immense success of his out-of-
nowhere single “Broccoli” to 
the top of the Billboard charts, 
proving himself both wide-
ranged and extremely capable. 
Now, D.R.A.M. is taking his 
favorite tunes around the world 
on the Big Baby D.R.A.M. Tour, 
a playful spectacle that perfectly 
parallels the energy of his debut 
studio album, Big Baby D.R.A.M. 
The show is as musical as it is 
fun, and though its impressive 
opening acts could nearly steal 
the 
spotlight, 
it’s 
D.R.A.M. 

himself who truly sets the 
evening’s tone.

On Thursday, Detroit’s El Club 

was already filled halfway to 
capacity by just 9:00 P.M. when 
River Tiber — a moody, somewhat 
psychedelic, 
electronic 
chill-

out band from Toronto — took 
the stage to start warming up 
the crowd with their drooping 
experimentation. With an inch 
of freshly-fallen snow coating 
Vernon Highway out front, the 
group’s singer clicked around 
on a laptop to initiate mellow 
drum loops while his wingmen 
plucked at the strings of their 
instruments with unswerving 
focus and fury. River Tiber 
creates a vibe that’s both mellow 
and intimate, but their intense 
instrumentality ultimately links 
the band to alternative rock: 
The guitars whine, like those in 
the most heavy-handed songs 
by The xx, as their players spew 
with the solo skills of veteran 
instrumentalists.

Around 10:00 P.M., River 

Tiber 
was 
relieved 
by 
Ari 

Lennox, a twenty-five year-old 
soulful vocal performer from 
Washington D.C. She came on 
stage wearing ripped leggings, 
black Vans and a “Stranger 
Things” t-shirt, but she didn’t 
emerge until after her DJ set the 
tone, spinning songs by Lauryn 
Hill and Erykah Badu.

Lennox led off with “GOAT,” 

then sat down to belch out the 
slower, more heartfelt “La La La 
La.” Before singing the intimate 
tune, she blamed it on a former 
eviction 
or 
two, 
explaining 

that she wrote its lyrics back 
when she was “running around 
L.A. and being crazy.” In the 
final moments of anticipation, 
just before the guitarist began 
jerking tears from the crowd 
through his articulately-capable 
fingertips, Lennox warned the 
crowd: “Don’t be afraid to look in 
my eyes, y’all!” Personableness is 
her great asset. 

Having 
just 
released 
her 

first commercial EP “FOH” in 
November, Lennox is on a fast-
track toward female figurehead 
status. 
On 
Thursday, 
she 

maintained effortless control for 
thirty straight minutes, her voice 
and charisma proving capable of 
carrying the crowd’s attention, 
and though many attendees 
might have been unaware of her 
prior, there were still audience 
members singing along, knowing 
every word.

Many hip-hop heads shared 

a unanimous epiphany when 
Lennox, setting up for her 
second to last song, asked the 
crowd if they had ever “gotten 
it” in a “backseat.” Immediately, 
I recalled where I knew her 
from: “Backseat (feat. Kozz)” 
— 
a 
standout 
track 
from 

Dreamville’s 2015 crew project, 
“Revenge of the Dreamers II” 
— came blaring through the 
speakers as Lennox’s addictive 
twang planted seeds for fandom 
in hundreds of ears, seeds that 
are certain to blossom with deep 
roots and longevity. She finished 
her set with “Yuengling,” then 
left the stage, the room in awe.

At 10:45 P.M., a new DJ came 

onstage, eventually followed by a 
three-piece live band. D.R.A.M. 
is a rare musician, having 
conquered the largely untouched 
intersection among pop, rap, 
R&B and childish giddiness, so 
it’s only natural that his show’s 
introduction is equally unique: 
Rather than walk out singing 
his own song, D.R.A.M. came 
out humming and whispering 
along as his band jammed to 
Drake’s recent hit, “Fake Love.” 
Perhaps I’m overthinking it, 
but 
the 
appropriative 
move 

might’ve been a fun, subtle way 
of taking from Drake as he did 
from D.R.A.M. After all, “Fake 
Love” does sound ironically like 
“Hotline Bling” (*cough* “Cha 
Cha”).

But D.R.A.M. gets serious. 

Wearing a white denim jacket 
from the KITH x Coca-Cola 
collection, he kicked his set 
off with album-intro “Get It 
Myself,” a soothing ode to 
autonomy, 
dedication 
and 

self-reliance that acts as a sort 
of synopsis on his pre-Big-
Baby-D.R.A.M. 
career, 
then 

dove 
into 
“Misunderstood,” 

a 
high-energy 
croon-tune 

with serious rock influence. 
“Detroit, what’s good?” he 
asked at the song’s end, met by 
excited cheers, then proceeded 
naturally into some of his 
most defining moments on 
the microphone: “If you love 
your momma, let me hear you 
say yeeeeah yo!” The crowd 
reacted at maximum volume.

“Signals (Throw It Around)” 

from his Gahdamn! EP came 
next as a nod to older fans, 
followed by “Outta Sight” — 
a 
high-tempo, 
dance-floor-

ready anthem about forgetting 
your ex. It turned El Club’s 
small, 
rectangular 
standing 

room into a bouncing castle 
and set a perfect mood for 
“Cute,” a slept-on hit from 
2016 that’s sure to explode 
in the new year. Then things 
slowed down again. D.R.A.M. 

asked for some help from his 
lady fans as he dove into his 
Queen-Erykah-Badu-assisted 
song, “Wifi,” on which he 
wrestles with the generational 
struggle of searching for a 
digital connection while a real, 
potentially romantic one is 
already right there, then eased 
into “Caretaker,” one of the 
most intimate and impressive 
songs from Donnie Trumpet 
& 
the 
Social 
Experiment’s 

Surf, which also appears on 
D.R.A.M.’s Gahdamn! EP.

After a brief recess from the 

stage, during which his band 
carried the crowd’s energy 
with improvisation, D.R.A.M. 
returned 
to 
introduce 
his 

instrumentalists. Beside the 
DJ, there were superb players 
on the keyboard, bass and 
drums, jamming in and out of 
songs in a profoundly musical, 
seemingly cohesive manner. 
They shared the spotlight for 
just a moment as D.R.A.M. 
explored his reflective deep 
cut, “Sweet VA Breeze.” Then 
he jumped into an inevitable 
series of hits that put the room 
at its absolute rowdiest.

“When you look at that 

paycheck you just acquired…I 
just want this song to be 
the 
soundtrack 
to 
your 

celebration,” 
D.R.A.M. 

explained, 
adding 
some 

weighty meaning to his latest 
hit, “Cash Machine,” before 
working through “Cha Cha” 
and “D.R.A.M. Sings Special” 
(a track turned interlude on 
Chance the Rapper’s Coloring 
Book, after the Chicago-emcee 
allegedly 
begged 
D.R.A.M. 

for it). And finally, there was 
“Broccoli,” 
the 
Lil-Yachty-

assisted 
former-number-

one song in America, which 
D.R.AM. told Billboard he 
originally expected to only 
be “lit for the culture, lit for 
Soundclound, for the internet.” 
Rather 
than 
move 
swiftly 

into the giddy, summertime 
smash hit, he tiptoed through 
a 
singsong 
rework, 
then 

exploded into the original 
version for one final hoorah, 
which included a dive into the 
crowd.

It’s tough to decide where 

D.R.A.M. 
belongs 
exactly 

within music, but it’s even 
tougher trying to define his live 
show, as it merges sounds and 
traits from almost every type 
of performance: he can turn 
up like a rapper, slow down 
like a neo-soul singer or even 
just freestyle aside his band, 
like the charismatic emcee 
of a great jam band might. If 
anything is certain, it’s that 
D.R.A.M. 
has 
everything 

necessary to succeed. He’s 
already shifted the culture by 
inspiring some of the biggest 
artists in the world. Now, he 
has his own number one hit in 
the rear-view mirror, a studio 
LP in his discography and a 
headlining tour on the horizon.

Expect D.R.A.M. to keep 

stockpiling 
his 
clout, 
one 

puppy-dog smile at a time. 
Hip-hop will only be a brighter, 
happier culture if he does. 

D.R.A.M. is more than a 
one-hit wonder at El Club

At his recent stop in Detroit, musician D.R.A.M. proves 
himself worthy among the El Club’s past storied artists

Whatever 
happened 
to 

human decency?

Over these past few days — or 

should I say, months — Twitter 
has transformed from a simple, 
minimalist platform into an all-
out, unfiltered reflection on our 
country’s social unrest.

After 
President 
Donald 

Trump enacted an executive 
order to ban refugees from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries, 
both 
Trump 

supporters and haters have 
engaged 
in 
an 
immersive 

online war over the recent 
commission, 
with 
Twitter 

being the main battleground 
and the endless supply of 
online resources serving as 
ammunition. Though, they had 
been feuding on the platform 
long before he was elected.

Thanks to the interconnected 

efficiency 
of 
the 
Internet, 

senators, celebrities and other 
social activists have reached out 
to users online, making a call to 
stand together as Americans in 
order to stop Trump’s hostile 
actions from continuing.

But how exactly can we 

unite as one when most of us 
still remain rigidly divided, 
especially 
on 
places 
like 

Twitter? How can we stand 
together when we blatantly 
label and dismiss people for 
speaking their minds? 

Both extreme sides of the 

political spectrum have found 
Twitter to be somewhat of a 
haven for expressing passionate 
thoughts 
on 
sociopolitical 

issues into 140 characters. 
Neither side, though, seems 
truly keen on breaking down 

barriers. Instead, each side will 
find ways to cite evidence to 
the other’s side wrongheaded 
claim, and attack the other side 
when they feel threatened.

For 
example, 
consistent 

conservatives on Twitter will 
call out progressive-minded 
people for being “triggered 
snowflakes,” while consistent 
liberals will identify those 
who support Trump and his 
policies as “racist” or “alt-
right Nazis.” In each case, 
both sides are right in their 
intentions, but very flawed 
in their execution. The label 
“triggered 
snowflakes” 
is 

particularly 
distasteful 

because it mistakes a person’s 
outspokenness 
against 

unjust actions for being too 
sensitive and offended when 
faced with a contradictory 
opinion. At the same time, 
though, some people who 
often 
preach 
tolerance 

of 
others 
are 
themselves 

intolerant 
towards 
people 

who are intolerant (i.e. Andy 
Richter, Rob Delaney and Kurt 
Eichenwald).

The 
“alt-right” 
label 
is 

definitely 
applicable 
when 

it comes to online accounts 
that promote racism, White 
supremacy, hate speech and 
extremely right-wing views 
(i.e. Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann 
Coulter and Richard Spencer). 
But not every Trump supporter 
or conservative is aligned with 
the same views as the “alt-
right,” and Twitter is mostly 
to blame for that. Censoring 
conservative voices, as racist 
and as bigoted as some may 
be, only furthers the divide 
between online users and 
any 
potential 
dialogue 
or 

legitimate nuanced criticisms

Due to Twitter’s character 

limit, the concision of each 
tweet extracts the nuance 
from the issues discussed 
online and thus they become 
diluted into oversimplified 
jabs that lead to a never-ending 
virtual pissing contest. There 
are better, more appropriate 
ways to communicate our 
disagreements, but Twitter 
doesn’t allow for that kind of 
exchange. It almost belittles 
that notion. 

Someone 
from 
either 

group might argue, “Well, 
Sam, why should I show 
compassion to someone who 
stands for something I don’t, 
especially when that someone 
incessantly provokes people 
like me?” It’s a valid question.

People 
have 
the 
right 

to speak out against those 
who willingly deny factual 
evidence that contradicts their 
own opinions. But at the same 
time, it’s hypocritical to think 
that another person’s opinion 
is invalid, simply because 
their opinion is different from 
yours. No one is asking you to 
like this person or his or her 
personal ideology. If we are 
going to make progress in this 
unruly mess we have found 
ourselves in, we shouldn’t 
continue to generalize other 
groups and categorize them 
into a malicious “otherness,” 
simply because they don’t 
share the same views. In the 
grand scheme of things, we are 
all “others.”

There are also internal 

factors at work that play into 
the much larger, more nuanced 
narrative of social media, 
particularly in the level of 
education, media consumption 
and media literacy of a Twitter 
user. Based on those factors, 
some are more privileged than 
others when it comes to making 
certain 
arguments. 
People 

who make ignorant comments 
about social or political issues 
might just be oblivious to how 
they will affect them. We 
shouldn’t be making fun of 
them by screenshotting their 
ignorant tweet, but instead 
building a bridge by offering 
them support.

Facebook also suffers from a 

similar problem, but to an even 

greater extent; that platform 
allows for users to launch into 
page-long rants. Though some 
politically 
laden 
Facebook 

posts have the ability to 
incorporate the nuance that 
Twitter lacks, it incites even 
greater conflict between users, 
leading to trails of defensive, 
paragraph-long comments.

Is social media a place 

that people can feel safe in 
engaging with others who 
share similar political beliefs? 
Yes, to an extent. Can it be 
used to be outspoken about 
particular issues, especially 
if it’s well-balanced and for 
the greater good of humanity? 
Sure. Can it motivate people to 
take action when necessary? 
Absolutely. It certainly helped 
spread news about the recent 
protests at national airports 
against Trump’s ban.

But is social media the most 

useful, productive space for 
political discourse? Definitely 
not. Because we have the 
tendency to subscribe to news 
sources that align with our 
own views, it is practically 
impossible 
for 
people 
to 

listen 
to 
other 
opinions 

when we thrive in an online 
echo chamber. There are too 
many examples of Twitter 
and Facebook threads that 
showcase the absurdity of the 
negative energy being wasted 
on making an argument.

This 
kind 
of 
incessant 

fighting on social media is 
nothing new. Trolls on both 
sides of the political spectrum 
have shown time and time 
again their disdain for the 

other side. But trolling won’t 
help us get to where we need 
to be.

It is hard to stand together 

as a people when we still can’t 
seem to get along even online. 
In this age of mistrust and 
misinformation, Internet users 
have become so consumed 
with 
labeling, 
chastising, 

denouncing and shunning that 
many of us have lost the will 
to examine and discuss the 
complexity of important social 
issues in civilized settings. 
We need to stop thinking 
in this polarized, collective 
black-and-white mindset of 
“us vs. them,” “liberal vs. 
conservative,” “left-wing vs. 
right-wing,” 
“Democrat 
vs. 

Republican” and “pro-Trump 
vs. 
anti-Trump.” 
I 
realize 

I may be preaching to the 
choir, but this cannot be said 
enough. If you really want to 
see change and unity, start 
reading 
publications 
from 

other 
websites 
that 
offer 

alternative views. Or even 
better, get off the Web and 
start engaging in a dialogue 
with people who challenge 
and disagree with you. That 
way, we might find a space to 
actually unite together as one 
nation.

Sundance Film Festival: 
Short films in summary

SUNDANCE

A quality short film can 

be just as impactful as a full-
length counterpart. In many 
ways, it combines the best 
qualities of a 90 minute movie, 
but in under 15. With smaller 
budgets and time constraints, 
directors must get creative with 
their storytelling methods. The 
2016 Sundance Short Films, 
sponsored by YouTube Red, all 
pack a sizeable punch equal to a 
full length movie.

This series features eight of 

the best short films from the 
2016 Sundance Film Festival, 
ranging 
from 
stop-motion 

animation 
to 
live-action 

documentary.

“Affections,” the first of 

the series, tells the story of 
a woman in an unfulfilling 
relationship 
searching 
for 

a 
better 
romantic 
partner. 

Her search, though, ends up 
taking 
an 
unconventional 

route. Mesmerized by a local 
homeless man, she offers him a 
ride one day. Leading to a brief 
fling that ends romantically 
on a rocky beach. The actor 
playing the homeless man is far 
too handsome and put together 
to be believable, but this almost 
makes it more entertaining. 
Following this hopeful and 
charming short is “Jungle,” 
a 
story 
about 
Senegalese 

street vendors in Manhattan. 

“Jungle” has enough potential 
to be extended out 80 more 
minutes 
because 
its 
story 

feels so original. It shows the 
competition 
between 
street 

vendors and the hardships they 
face, especially when taken 
advantage of by their “bosses.”

“Edmond Eats Everything” 

is a stop-motion animated short 
and one of the most original 
looking films I have ever seen. 
The dialogue-less story focuses 
on a man and his destructive 
habit of eating unlikely things, 
like 
friends 
and 
fetuses. 

Although challenging, it ends 
in an unusually beautiful way. 
“Bacon and God’s Wrath” is 
a short-documentary about a 
Jewish woman who, after 90 
years, disobeys her religion and 
eats bacon. It’s a fun look into 
the cause of apostasy and its 
inconsequential effects on the 
woman. Still, it feels a bit slow 
and unrewarding.

Like “Affections,” the trough 

of a relationship is the theme 
in “Her Friend Adam.” The 
short highlights insecurity and 
jealousy extremely realistically. 
It’s like a more serious version 
of the “you vs. the guy she says 
not to worry about” meme. 
Then, “The Grandfather Drum” 
takes a drastically different 
pace. This visually captivating 
short is animated like a picture 
book, telling the story of a 
Native American family and a 
drum that heals sickness.

“The 
Procedure” 
is 
the 

funniest and most obtuse short 

in the series. Within the first 
seconds, a man is tranquilized 
while getting into his car. When 
he wakes up, he is locked to a 
chair with his eyes forced open 
“A Clockwork Orange”-style. 
When he screams, a neon sign 
reading “Quiet Please” lights 
up, accompanied by a loud 
horn. From the ceiling drops 
a butt until it hangs inches 
away from the man’s face and 
releases a fart. The man then 
escapes. Under four minutes, 
“The Procedure” is terrifying; 
nobody wants to have a literal 
ass fart inches above their nose. 
Everyone can feel his pain.

The 
series 
ends 
with 

“Thunder Road,” a long-take 
of a man giving a eulogy at 
his 
mother’s 
funeral. 
Jim 

Cummings (“The Lion King”) 
gives the most heart-warming 
performance in the series. It 
combines dark humor with his 
ability to portray a man clearly 
torn apart by his mother’s 
death. At the end, he sings and 
dances to Bruce Springsteen’s 
“Thunder 
Road,” 
resulting 

in 
embarrassment 
and 
his 

daughter’s shame.

All 
of 
the 
shorts 
show 

desperation 
and 
isolation 

better than most full-length 
movies. Decreasing attention 
spans 
are 
leading 
to 
a 

possibility for short films to 
become more popular. And, 
if they are anything like the 
best of 2016’s Sundance Film 
Festival, this is a promising, 
hopeful prediction.

FILM REVIEW

‘Respect’ and the complex 
politics of song ownership

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Last weekend, I road tripped 

to the Women’s March in 
Washington, D.C. with three 
other girls. It’s about a nine-
hour drive, which gave us all 
plenty of room to expose each 
other to our respective music 
tastes, and somewhere along 
the line, we decided that it 
wouldn’t be a trip to a Women’s 
March without an appropriate 
amount of empowering feminist 
music. Naturally, we turned to 
Aretha Franklin’s “Respect.” 
As soon as the beginning notes 
sounded through the speakers, 
we turned up the volume, 
already lifting our arms to start 
dancing in our seats.

I didn’t know it then, but I 

would go on to talk about that 
same song in one of my classes 
the next week. Apparently, 
“Respect” 
was 
originally 

written in 1965 by Otis Redding. 
The original lyrics surprised 
me: The man of this version of 
“Respect” is telling a woman 
he’s “about to give [her] all 
[his] money,” and pleading for 
her to give him “respect when 
[he comes] home.” For me, 
this was a sharp contrast with 
Franklin’s version from 1967, in 
which she assumes the power 
in the relationship and calls 
for a man to give her “propers 
when [he gets] home.”

Each song comes from the 

perspective of someone who 
wants respect, but Franklin’s 
version seems to have a more 
demanding message, and it was 
this version that was seized 
upon, across the country and 
around the world, as an anthem 
for respect. I already knew of its 
association with the feminist 
movement, 
but 
“Respect” 

also came to represent the 
struggles of the Civil Rights 
movement 
and 
of 
soldiers 

fighting overseas in Vietnam. 
It was widely popular and soon 
became Franklin’s signature 
song. At the Monterey Pop 
Festival in 1967, Redding was 
quoted referring to “Respect” 
as a song “that a girl took away 
from me.”

This got me thinking about 

the extent to which a song can 
be owned. I don’t mean in a 
business-related or monetary 
sense, but rather in terms of 
its association with a person. 
Redding wrote the song and 
was the first to record it, but 
ever since Franklin released 
her version, the song has been 
regarded for the most part as 
hers. But here’s the thing: In a 
way, the song has even gotten 
away from Aretha Franklin. In 
response to the song’s success, 
she has said that she didn’t 
initially mean for it to represent 
any of the movements with 
which it came to be associated. 
She was just singing about 
something that mattered to her: 
Respect.

Sometimes, of course, the 

link between an artist and 
a song that they release – 
that they “own,” in the eyes 
of the public — can turn out 
less favorably. It can become 
so strong, so singular, that 
the artist is dubbed a one-hit 
wonder and stuck with the 
song indefinitely. Lou Reed 
once made a joke about his 
own obituary starting out 
with the beginning notes of 
“Walk on the Wild Side,” and 
in the days before he met with 
more 
commercial 
success, 

Beck would sometimes refuse 
to play his hit “Loser” during 
live shows, or else change the 
words so that nobody could 
sing along. The artist’s tie 
to a song can also take the 
road that it did with Redding 
and be replaced, in the eyes 
of history, by another link 
between the same song and 
a different artist. “Hound 

Dog,” 
for 
instance, 
was 

originally recorded by Big 
Mama Thornton but I didn’t 
even know this until last fall, 
because all over the world it is 
associated with Elvis Presley.

It is also this link that gives 

songs their identity, for better 
or for worse. For all the artist’s 
effort, at the end of the day, 
the appreciation of that song 
does not begin and end with its 
artist. I have grown attached 
to so many new songs just by 
hearing them on the radio 
and feeling, regardless of who 
wrote them or of why they 
were written, like I connected 
with what they were saying. 
I feel like – crowds of people 
will sing along with Hozier’s 
“Take Me to Church,” or Frank 
Ocean’s “Bad Religion,” even 
when they don’t identify with 
the intended meaning of the 
song — and that’s okay. They 
wouldn’t sing along if there 
weren’t something there that 
they were connecting with, 
whether this connection was 
the kind the artist was hoping 
for or not.

I believe that this feeling of 

connection within Franklin’s 
version of “Respect” is what 
people from so many different 
movements 
caught 
onto. 

Driving 
on 
some 
highway 

through 
Pennsylvania 
last 

weekend, most of us in the car 
didn’t know that the song had 
in fact been done by Redding 
first. I listened to Redding’s 
version, and it’s good, really 
good, and I credit him for it 
— Franklin wouldn’t have her 
own version without it — but 
it’s a different song. Right then, 
on the road, we were listening 
to Aretha Franklin, we heard 
what she was saying, and we 
were responding to it, assuming 
the demand for respect in our 
own identities. And even if 
that wasn’t what Franklin — or 
Redding — intended, I thank 
them for it anyway.

In memory of my favorite 
t-shirt: A six-year story

For awhile, I thought that clothes 

were just clothes. While I always 
felt it was important to make an 
effort to dress well, I never thought 
about the emotional associations 
that clothes have. That was until 
I found myself having to decide 
whether or not to throw away a 
shirt that had deteriorated after six 
years of frequent use. Ultimately, I 
decided that while I may never wear 
it again, I simply could not give it 
away because of the memories that 
it holds. So here’s to you, my six-
year-old t-shirt.

I remember the first day we met: 

I was in need of better-fitting shirts 
that didn’t boast a Nike or Adidas 
logo. I went to the mall, and I found 
you — it felt like a match made in 
heaven. You fit me like a glove and 
you were on sale, so I knew we were 
destined for great things.

For the first few months of our 

love affair, we were inseparable — 
I’d wear you once or twice a week, 
make sure you got cleaned and we’d 
do it all over again the next week. 
You were there for me during the 
best and the worst of that school 
year — my hardest exams, holiday 
gatherings with family and even 
when dad was admitted to the ICU. 
Then in July 2011, something that 
I had tried my best to mentally 
prepare myself for what happened: 
dad’s long fight with cancer came to 
an end. As my parents’ only son, and 
as a Hindu, I was responsible for 
performing the funeral rituals.

I knew I didn’t need a shirt for 

the funeral itself since I would be 
wearing a veshti as I did for all pujas 
(prayer rituals), but I instinctively 
reached for you when I was getting 
dressed on the morning of the 
ceremony. You were there with me 
on the way to the funeral home, on 

the way to the crematorium and 
as I cried in the car later that day. 
You saw more of what I was going 
through than even my family and 
closest friends.

Something changed after that 

week. When I was getting ready in 
the mornings for months after his 
funeral, I would see you hanging 
out in the corner of my dresser but 
I couldn’t bring myself to put you 
on, because by doing that I would 
have to acknowledge what had 
happened. This wasn’t something 
that was exclusive to my choice of 
attire. I did everything in my power 
to avoid acknowledging the reality 
that he was gone forever. It had 
a profound effect on my life for a 
while — I wasn’t in a good mental 
place, but fortunately I found the 
help that I needed.

For the most part, I was able to 

acknowledge the hole that my dad’s 
passing had left in my life and was 
able to grow from it. Still, when I 
got dressed in the morning, I didn’t 
reach for you. I made excuses for 
avoiding you. “Oh, you’re too old,” 
“You don’t fit well anymore” or “It’s 
too cold” were the justifications I 
told myself, when the simple reality 
was that, at that point in my life, 
I wasn’t ready to relive the week 
of my father’s funeral. From the 
cremation to the spreading of his 
ashes, that was a can of worms that 
I still wasn’t ready to open.

As time passed I became more 

nostalgic for those last few months 
spent with dad. When I thought 
about his death, I went from 
feeling cheated out of years of 
memories with him to being able 
to think about all of the qualities he 
instilled in me. I realized that, while 
unfortunate, his death was one of 
the most life-changing things that 
had happened to me. I realized that 
it had taught me how to grow up, 
how to prioritize what mattered to 
me in life and served as a reminder 

of how precious family is.

Getting dressed one day in the 

summer of 2012, I saw you poking 
out from under a stack of shirts and 
decided that it was time to embrace 
all of the memories that you carried: 
from the ones that you were with 
me for, like the funeral, to the ones 
that you helped me remember, like 
driving around Chicago listening to 
my dad and my favorite songs with 
the windows down. I’m always 
afraid that sooner or later those 
memories will fade, and they likely 
will, but whenever I put you on, I 
remember everything about him. 
So while I may never wear you 
again, hopefully you’re willing to 
stick around in case I ever need to 
take a trip down memory lane.

Clothes are extremely personal. 

On the surface level, the way you 
dress is a fairly strong indicator of 
the type of person you are (or aspire 
to be), but on a deeper level, they 
are also a vehicle for processing 
memories and emotions. This 
summer, I was looking at flannels 
in a vintage store when one caught 
my eye: It was only $1, so I figured 
that there was no real reason not to 
pick it up. I have spent much more 
on other shirts, but I always find 
myself coming back to this shirt. 
Whether I’m bar-hopping, going 
on a date or going to class, I always 
have to stop myself from wearing 
it too often so I’m not known as 
the guy who only wears one shirt. 
We have already made countless 
memories: We went to New York 
together for a concert, we went 
to Europe for a month together 
and we have many more trips to 
come. The interesting thing about 
clothing is how continuous it is: As 
one piece of clothing slowly fades 
out of my wardrobe, another one 
enters the fold and new memories 
are made. I can’t wait to see what 
I’ll think of when I put this shirt on 
in a few years.

Wolverines to battle Illinois in Champaign

Halfway 
through 
its 

conference 
season, 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team is exactly where it wants 
to be — poised 
to shake off 
its postseason 
slump.

The 

Wolverines’ 
17-5 
record 

through 
22 

games 
is 

their 
best 

in 
program 

history, 
and 

with five of 
their 
final 

eight 
regular 

season games 
coming against teams in the 
bottom half of the Big Ten, 
it 
wouldn’t 
be 
far-fetched 

for them to run the table and 
secure a place in the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since 2013.

“I’m 
surprised 
with 
our 

success considering our youth,” 
said 
junior 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston. “Everyone’s embraced 
their roles and applied it the 
best they can and helped us 
reach 
these 
aspirations. 
… 

Everyone had the same attitude 
and the same goals.

“In order to achieve our 

goals, we have to get it done 
now. It’s not a next year thing.”

Wednesday’s 
matchup 
at 

Illinois (3-6 Big Ten, 8-14 
overall) will provide Michigan 
with the opportunity to move 
one step closer to making that 
possibility a reality.

The Fighting Illini — entering 

the contest on a four-game 
losing streak — have struggled 
this season to challenge teams 
with their lackluster offense. 
They average just 62.5 points 
per 
contest 
and 
sport 
an 

ugly 38.7 percent field-goal 
percentage, placing them in 
the bottom third for Division I 
teams.

When Illinois is making its 

shots, its offense is typically 

through 6-foot-1 forward Alex 
Wittinger, who leads the team 
with 15.2 points per game. 
Wittinger is also the Fighting 
Illini’s 
best 
player 
on 
the 

defensive end, averaging 8.2 
boards and 2.4 blocks per game.

While 
Wittinger 
has 

catalyzed an otherwise lifeless 
offense, she will have a four-
inch height disadvantage in 
her matchup against one of the 
Big Ten’s best centers in Hallie 
Thome, 
who 
has 
anchored 

the Wolverines’ defense and 
boasts 
the 
ninth-best 
field 

goal percentage in the country 
(63.8).

“[It’s] important for us to 

reward Hallie,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico on 
WTKA on Tuesday. “If she’s 
gonna run the floor the way 
that she does, we’re giving 
her touches. Our team does an 
outstanding job of finding her 
in transition.”

Illinois should find it difficult 

to maneuver around Thome at 
the rim, and may struggle to 

find success beyond the arc to 
compensate. The Fighting Illini 
rank 145th in made 3-pointers. 
By comparison, Michigan is 
13th.

A 
significant 
contributor 

to the Wolverines’ offensive 
prowess has been 
freshman Kysre 
Gondrezick. 
The 
5-foot-9 

guard has been 
spectacular since 
playing her way 
into the starting 
lineup on Dec. 
28, 
and 
was 

recently awarded 
both 
Big 
Ten 

Freshman 
and 

Player of the Week honors for 
posting 22 points, seven boards 
and six assists in Michigan’s 
80-54 win over Northwestern 
last Wednesday.

“Kysre has really shown her 

ability to be a playmaker at the 
next level,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Sometimes when you have 
a bunch of kids on your team 

that are great scorers, they 
forget their ability to pass the 
basketball and make the extra 
pass.”

Everything seems to favor 

the 
Wolverines 
going 
into 

the contest, but one glaring 

problem 
lies 

ahead of them 
in 
tomorrow’s 

matchup — the 
Fighting 
Illini 

love playing at 
the State Farm 
Center. 
They 

have 
an 
8-5 

record at home, 
compared 
to 

0-9 outside of 
Champaign.

“Illinois is a team that plays 

really well at home,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They play a five-
out style which will be tough 
for our bigs. They’ll try to 
penetrate and draw fouls and 
get to the free-throw line.”

But barring an anomalous 

performance from Michigan, it 
shouldn’t be too concerned.

CLAIRE MENGAST/Daily

Sophomore center Hallie Thome will have a clear height advantage over Illinois’ best player, forward Alex Wittinger.

finally hit empty.

All season, the Michigan men’s 

basketball team has been relying 
on what is essentially a seven-man 
rotation made up of its starting 
lineup, redshirt junior guard 
Duncan Robinson and senior 
forward Mark Donnal.

Even calling it a seven-man 

rotation is generous. Donnal 
averages just 14.3 minutes per 
game – most of which have come 
when sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner is in foul trouble – while 
Robinson averages 20.2. Beyond 
that, freshman guard Xavier 
Simpson has the next highest 
total with 9.3 minutes played per 
game.

On the opposite end of that 

spectrum, senior wing Zak Irvin 
and guard Derrick Walton Jr. are 
second and sixth in the Big Ten 
in minutes played per game with 
34.8 and 33.0, respectively.

The biggest concern? There is 

no viable option behind Irvin at 
the wing position.

The Wolverines certainly found 

out just how problematic that is 

against Michigan State on Sunday.

Against the Spartans, Irvin 

logged 36 minutes, tied for the 
second-highest total on the team. 
But those lofty minutes didn’t 
translate to expected results, as 
he scored zero points on 0-for-8 
shooting while turning the ball 
over three times and tallying just 
two rebounds and two assists 
– marking his first scoreless 
performance 
since 
the 
2015 

season opener.

For all intents and purposes, 

Michigan had been playing with 
fire, and it got burned badly.

“He didn’t make the shots he 

usually makes,” Walton said. “We 
trust him 100 percent. I just don’t 
think he was himself.”

It was revealed after the game 

that Irvin took the floor having 
battled the flu in the days leading 
up to the matchup with Michigan 
State. He had missed two practices 
prior to the trip to East Lansing, 
trying to recover for what was a 
much-needed and hotly-contested 
conference road win.

Irvin 
had 
emphasized 
to 

Michigan coach John Beilein that 
he felt good enough to play. But as 
his stat line indicated, he was far 
from good, and the Wolverines left 

the Breslin Center still winless on 
the road this season.

That’s not to knock Irvin’s 

effort. Instead, it simply paints 
a picture of just how precarious 
the Wolverines’ depth issues are. 
Freshman forward Ibi Watson – 
who was expected to be Irvin’s 
backup this season, but still hasn’t 
acclimated well enough to the 
college game – played only one 
minute.

As a result, Robinson saw an 

uptick to 30 minutes of playing 
time against the Spartans, but 
mustered just eight points. It’s a 
troubling sign that even an ailing 
Irvin appears to be a better option 
than those outside of Michigan’s 
seven-man rotation right now.

“I think we’re going to look 

back at it,” Beilein said Sunday. 
“It probably wasn’t the right 
thing to do. But he’s one of our 
best passers, he’s one of our best 
scorers, he plays three different 
positions for us. It’s hard to take 
him out of there.”

Irvin entered the matchup 

against Michigan State averaging 
a team-high 14.4 points per game. 
He had increased that production 
to 17 points per game in a four-
game 
stretch, 
during 
which 

he helped the Wolverines dig 
themselves out of a 1-3 conference 
hole.

Walton showcased an ability 

to shoulder the burden when 
Irvin was struggling against the 
Spartans, scoring a game-high 24 
points to go with nine rebounds. 
Even with a healthy Irvin, the 
senior guard has averaged 18.6 
points and 6.2 rebounds per game 
in Michigan’s last five contests.

With Walton playing arguably 

the best basketball of his career, 
the Wolverines simply needed 
another 
contribution 
to 
help 

Walton carry the load down the 
stretch to escape East Lansing 
with a win and go above .500 in 
conference play for the first time 
this season. But even that was too 
much to ask.

The 
issue 
becomes 
even 

more pressing when you look at 
the current Big Ten landscape. 
Maryland and Wisconsin are 

currently tied for first in the 
conference with a 7-1 Big Ten 
record, while Northwestern is on 
their heels with a 7-2 record of its 
own.

The Terrapins have 11 players 

that have played more than 
10 games, and all of them are 
averaging above 10 minutes per 
game. Even guard Melo Trimble 
is averaging less minutes per game 
than both Irvin and Walton, and 
five of Maryland’s players are 
averaging between 13.8 and 18.6 
minutes per game.

As for the Badgers, it’s more of 

the same. While Wisconsin has 
just an eight-man rotation – only 
one more than the Wolverines 
– its minutes are distributed 
more efficiently. Michigan has 
three players averaging above 30 
minutes per game in Irvin, Walton 
and redshirt sophomore forward 
DJ Wilson.

The Badgers, on the other 

hand, 
have 
their 
two 
best 

players barely registering such 
significant time. Guard Bronson 
Koenig and forward Nigel Hayes 
share the heaviest workload 
with 30.0 and 30.9 minutes 
per game, respectively. Beyond 
that, though, Wisconsin has five 
players averaging between 15.4 
and 27.4 minutes per game, with 
an additional two contributing 
10.1 to 11 minutes on a consistent 
basis.

And 
finally, 
there’s 
the 

Wildcats. 
Like 
the 
Badgers, 

Northwestern boasts a roster with 
eight players averaging above 10 
minutes per game. Guard Bryant 
McIntosh is the only outlier, as he 
averages 33.4 minutes per game 
– a mark slightly above Walton’s 
total.

If 
the 
upper 
tier 
of 
the 

conference is any indication, depth 
is winning games this year, as it 
often does. Some teams manage 
to get by with a limited rotation, 
but to do so requires elite talent. 
And in a 31-game season, having 
options off the bench certainly 
doesn’t hurt a team’s chances of 
grinding out wins. Right now, 
as Irvin’s flu game indicated, 
Michigan doesn’t have them.

Red Berenson reflects on Summit Series

It was perhaps the most 

important hockey series of all 
time.

In the 1960s, the Soviet 

Union 
hockey 
teams 
were 

dominant. While only amateur 
hockey players were allowed to 
compete in world competition, 
the USSR gave its players 
positions in the military while 
allowing them to play hockey 
full-time.

This 
change 
allowed 

them to unseat the previous 
top 
country: 
Canada. 
The 

Canadians’ best players mostly 
competed 
professionally, 
so 

they were no match for the 
quasi-professional Soviets.

So when the USSR was looking 

for a new challenge, Canada was 
eager to put together a team of 
its professionals to take on the 
Soviets. It would be the first time 
the best players from the USSR 
would play the best professionals 
from somewhere else.

Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson was one of those 
professionals.

At the time, Berenson was 

about to start his 13th season 
in the NHL and his first full 
season with the Detroit Red 
Wings. In the summer of 1972, 
he was among nearly 40 players 
chosen to play for Canada, 
and Berenson admits he didn’t 
know what to expect from the 
USSR.

“We knew they were really 

good amateurs, but we didn’t 
think they were as good as the 
pros,” Berenson said. “Nobody 
really had a really good scouting 
report on them. So we had our 
training camp, and we were 
fired up. It was just a matter 
of how bad we were going to 
beat them. Nobody gave them a 
chance to win a game.”

The two sides decided to 

play an eight-game series, later 
dubbed the “Summit Series”: 
four games would be played in 
Canada and the other four in 
the USSR.

It didn’t take long before 

it 
seemed 
the 
Canadians’ 

confidence was well-founded. 
Legendary 
forward 
Phil 

Esposito — who played 19 
seasons in the NHL — scored 
just 30 seconds into the game 
before Paul Henderson — a 
13-year player in the NHL — 
added another to give Canada a 
two-goal lead.

The Soviets rebounded in a 

big way, though. They scored 
four 
straight 

goals en route to 
a 7-3 victory.

“By the end 

of 
the 
second 

period, 
we 

were 
on 
our 

heels, and they 
were 
flying,” 

Berenson 
said. 

“Then, 
the 

country was in 
shock. 
‘Holy 

Christ, what’s wrong with our 
team, our players, our system?’ 

So we had a day off — a day to 
practice and try to regroup 

— 
and 
then 

we 
played 
in 

Toronto.”

And 
in 
the 

second 
game 

of 
the 
series, 

the 
Canadians 

responded. They 
dominated their 
way 
to 
a 
4-1 

victory, tying up 
the series.

From 

there, it seemed Canada was 
outmatched. The teams played 

to a tie in game three, before 
the USSR regained the series 
lead with a 5-3 win in game 
four.

The 
displeasure 
from 

Canadian 
hockey 
fans 

increased, too. Prior to game 
four, the crowd booed Canada 
and cheered for the Soviets 
instead. To them, the home 
product they were seeing was 
simply not good enough.

“I 
didn’t 
blame 
them, 

really,” Berenson said. “I don’t 
know that they were blaming 
individual players, but they 
were blaming Canadian hockey.

games got just about out of 
control. But the hockey still 
took over, and the hockey 
benefitted from them, and the 
games turned out to be great 
games.

“Like the whole rink was 

circled with soldiers — the 
whole outside of the boards. So 
Paul Henderson, one of our best 
players, got hurt and slid into 
the boards, and they tried to get 
the doctor out. They wouldn’t 
let the doctor out onto the ice. 
… So they had all kinds of little 
issues.”

All of this led to great 

FILE PHOTO/Daily

Michigan coach Red Berenson discussed his experience travelling to the Soviet Union and competing on the side of the Canadian hockey team during a turbulent time across the globe in the 1970s.

Like, ‘We’ve got to be better 

than this. This is the best in the 
NHL?’ ”

Esposito took notice, too. In 

a post-game interview, he gave 
an impassioned speech to his 
country, assuring them that the 
Canadians were trying their 
best, but that the USSR was 
simply a very good team.

Either way, things looked 

bleak for Canada. It had blown 
any semblance of home-ice 
advantage it may have had, and 
now faced the daunting task of 
needing to win three of four 
games in the Soviet Union to 
win the series.

Things got even worse when 

the Soviets overcame a three-
goal deficit in 
the third period 
to win again in 
game five. Not 
only did the loss 
create a bigger 
challenge 
for 

the 
Canadians 

on the ice, but 
upon 
arrival 

in 
the 
USSR, 

the 
players 

began to realize 
the 
experience 
transcended 

hockey.

“It was becoming a national, 

political challenge,” Berenson 
said. “This was the free world 
against communism, and it was 
our way of life against their way 
of life. It was amazing. It took 
on a life of its own.”

Canada 
began 
to 
mount 

a 
comeback 
in 
game 
six. 

Berenson tallied an assist — 
his only point of the series — 
to help his team to a 3-2 win, 
before the Canadians earned 
another victory, 4-3, in game 
seven to tie up the series, 3-3-1.

And as the series grew tighter, 

the play on the ice became more 
contentious as well. Though 
there weren’t any fights allowed 
in European hockey, Berenson 
says the Soviets still knew how 
to get even.

“It was nasty,” Berenson 

said. “They played with a lot 
of sportsmanship, but they 
played with an edge, too. They 
knew how to spear you, and 
they knew how to kick you, and 
they played rough differently 
than we did. And I don’t think 
our players handled it well, 
and I don’t think their players 
handled it well either. So the 

anticipation for the deciding 
game. Canadian schools gave 
their students a half-day off 
school so they could watch the 
game. As a result, game eight 
was the most-watched sporting 
event in Canadian television 
history until 2010.

It ended up being worth 

it. With less than a minute 
left, and the score tied at five, 
Henderson collected a rebound 
in front of the net and scored 
what would is now known as 
‘The Goal of the Century’ to 
give Canada a victory in the 
Summit Series.

Despite the win, Berenson 

recalls that he couldn’t wait to 
get out of the country.

“You just felt 

like 
you 
were 

in a large, not 
necessarily 
a 
prison, 
but 

you were in a 
confinement 
of some kind,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“Even when you 
left 
your 
hotel 

room, you had to 
turn your key in, 

and then we found out all of our 
stuff had been gone through and 
so on.”

Berenson wasn’t the only one 

who wanted to leave quickly. 
After the series ended, most 
of the team went on to play an 
exhibition game against the 
Czechoslovak national team. 
Berenson, on the other hand, 
wanted to join the Red Wings 
in training camp.

So, he boarded a plane with 

many of the Canadian fans who 
travelled to the USSR. They shared 
his feeling of homesickness.

“The minute that plane took 

off, the whole plane started to 
cheer,” Berenson said. “There 
were people crying, cheering. 
It was like they’d escaped. And 
then the pilot said, ‘We are now 
crossing the Iron Curtain,’ and 
they cheered again. … I mean 
that’s how we were feeling.”

Ultimately, 
the 
Summit 

Series will be remembered 
for showing the world exactly 
what the Soviets were capable 
of in hockey, and for providing 
a glimpse into their daily lives.

“ ‘We’ve got to be 
better than this. 
This is the best in 

the NHL?’ ”

In the summer of 1972, the Michigan hockey coach played for Canada against the Soviet Union

“And it was 

our way of life 
against their 
way of life”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 1, 2017


T

he Last Word is a classic cocktail — 
reportedly first served in the Detroit 
Athletic Club in the 1910s — made of equal 

parts gin, lime juice, Maraschino liqueur and green 
Chartreuse. It’s also a secret bar in Ann Arbor’s Old 
West Side, accessed through an unmarked door 
on Huron Street. Though it’s mostly publicized 
through word of mouth, the elusive nature of the 
place isn’t an obstacle in attracting clientele. On a 
Wednesday night, the bartender is shaking drinks 
like maracas for a full house.

The interior of the bar is as classic as its signature 

cocktail: from my table, darkly stained wood 
paneling and squishy leather booths are barely 
discernable in the dusky room. The booths seem 
perfect for a clandestine rendezvous with an older 
man, maybe a professor. Instead, I’m with two of my 
friends who clean up even better than I do. I order, 
as if I have a choice, The Last Word. My friends both 
request Kissed By A Rose, cocktails that arrive as 
tiny pink potions capped with foam, and sprinkled 
with actual potpourri. My drink is everything I 
hate in a beverage: citrusy, and with more swiftly 
disintegrating ice shards than the North Pole. It is 
served straight-up with a lime, and is the kind easily 
paired with a little black dress and heels. I’m in fact 
wearing both, trying to compensate for how young 
the setting makes me feel.

Stacked among the drink menus, completing the 

impression of having a drink with 007, are ultimately 
decorative hardcover books. The string lights from 
above are set so dim they appear untethered — a 
constellation hovering above the gloom. Because 
we are so visible while the rest of the bar is not, we 
feel exposed, like being onstage in front of a rudely 

inattentive audience.

The darkness fogs the gray walls to a pale green, 

and is at once comforting and sinister: While it 
ensures privacy, the only way you’d recognize the 
other patrons is if you already knew they were 
there. It’s a place where you feel like you should be 
whispering — the building is styled as a speakeasy 
— but you’re probably shouting over your table. The 
cacophony of voices somehow affirms the intimacy 
of the setting, as you can’t hear anyone but your 
tablemates. The atmosphere invites confidence, and 
like emotional ipecac it forces patrons into spill-
your-guts meaningful conversation. The crowd 
appears to be mostly couples or old friends, leaning 
close to hear each other, brushing shoulders or 
thighs. This isn’t a first-date kind of place; we’re 
surrounded by people who’ve already seen each 
other in the dark.

Instead of dessert, we split an order of Thai poutine 

(braised beef, coconut red curry, cheese curds and 
fried basil) and beef sliders (caramelized shallot, 
gruyere and Dijon) that are so delicious I’m insulted 
by how affordable they are, even with my limited 
budget. I am swiftly outclassed by my friend, who, 
after consulting the menu for five minutes says: “We 
can get a salted caramel beignet!” Though we’ve 
taken the same amount of French, I still need her 
to explain that it’s “basically a donut.” Later I order 
whiskey, because it’s half-priced, and I describe my 
desired brand as “the cheapest you’ve got.”

When a waiter comes to whisk away my empty 

cocktail glass, I quiz him about the concept of 
The Last Word. He characterizes the drink as a 
collection of strong components that don’t make a 
lot of sense on paper. Gin overpowers any cocktail 

it’s party to, same with Maraschino and Chartreuse. 
But for some reason, it works.

While I can say it’s not my favorite drink, The 

Last Word as an establishment balances a variety 
of flavors with finesse and aplomb. The waiter 
provided a made-to-order metaphor for the place: 
a strategically blended cocktail of theoretically 
clashing themes. It’s equal parts Prohibition-era 
watering hole, part whiskey bar, part townie bar, 
part date-night destination — themes so strong 
they shouldn’t complement one another. But five 
nights a week, The Last Word shakes and serves.

he white girl in the headdress does not 
know why she is wrong.

It’s 2017, and the cultural appropriation 

debate is losing its substance by the minute. I do not 
want to hear a single person complain about someone 
stealing from their culture unless they are willing to 
do something about it. Don’t just rant, Social Justice 
Warrior; fight for your heritage. Enlighten. Empty 
criticism does little to support your cause.

Somewhere, there is a young white woman who 

does not understand the significance of the cornrows 
she is wearing. Telling her she is a bigot will do 
nothing but encourage anger. Complaining about 
her in a Buzzfeed article is not going to motivate any 
form of positive change. There is no tangible benefit 
to ostracizing a naive individual.

Show her why her actions were offensive. 

Acknowledge the presence of what is likely helpless, 
palpable ignorance caused by life in a white-washed 
community. Brief her on the origins of the tightly 

set braids, and explain to her why she should care. 
Give her the option to change her perspective so 
that she may learn (if she chooses — unfortunately, 
not everyone will) to appreciate the rich cultural 
history from which she unknowingly stole.

At present, most of the conversation surrounding 

cultural appropriation is chock full of “I’m sick of”s 
and “I hate”s. Energy that could have been spent 
educating is wasted on tweet after tweet of pure 
anger and exasperation. Of course, a certain amount 
of anger has its rightful place in this movement. It’s 
only human to be upset when someone steals what is 
yours. Yet when it comes down to it, we are speaking 
in shallow circles that allow for minimal progress, 
and it is disheartening.

There are exceptions to this rule. Young activists 

like Amandla Stenberg provide substantive advice 
for tackling appropriation in their posts on social 
media. Thanks to publications like Teen Vogue, 
along with the availability of diverse perspectives 

thanks to the internet, discussions of culture are 
slowly becoming more common.

Yet a grave disparity still exists between the 

appropriator and the appropriated. Few lines of 
cultural communication have been forged — the 
conversation remains somewhat exclusive to the 
affected, rather than inviting potential cultural 
poachers to walk in a new pair of shoes.

It is impossible for one person to know everything 

about every culture. Friction will always occur. 
What matters is how we choose to approach that 
friction. To educate is to grab hold of an issue by its 
roots, infecting it with the power of openness and 
information. After all, we cannot appreciate what 
we don’t know.

Invite the ignorant to join you, Social Justice 

Warrior. Encourage appreciation. Cultures will 

always be divided to some degree, but unless we 

allow for a certain level of openness, these divisions 

will only deepen. The fear of offending is enough 

to prevent the majority from asking questions 

as well as to keep the minority from calling out 

appropriation in a productive way. A lack of honest 

communication is keeping both sides of this debate 

from learning from their own mistakes.

I fully acknowledge my privilege in writing this 

article. I am lucky enough to have had my Argentine 

roots exploited on only the rarest of occasions 

— and even then, I’m white. I reap the benefits of 

an appearance that often causes me to forget that 

half my family does not look like me. I will never 

understand what it’s like to grow up being made fun 

of for my facial features, the food I eat or the way I 

wear my hair, only to see it promoted in an all-white 

ad campaign years later.

That is the background from which this opinion 

stems. I recognize that there is no one concrete 

solution to the appropriation debate, but we must 

begin taking risks. Even if we’re unsure of our 

strategies in raising awareness, they could lead us in 

the right direction.

An outsider will never understand your culture 

the way you do. However, if she learns to value 
its customs and traditions as she would her own, 
perhaps she’ll finally think twice before making that 
DIY Chippewa headdress she saw on Pinterest.

oogle Maps has never given 

me much of a warning before 

an impending turn. Today is 

no exception. Less than 100 feet before 

my next maneuver, Siri’s indolent Google 

Maps cousin alerts me of the approaching 

Michigan Avenue, so I shove my blue Lin-

coln Town Car across a precarious number 

of lanes. This would normally be a problem 

on a highway, but I’m going to Detroit. Even 

when the city’s gentrified midtown experi-

ences a surge of nightlife activity, I’ve never 

experienced traffic. The first cross street off 

the exit before Michigan Avenue is Ash. Just 

Ash. It has no indication of being a street, 

avenue or boulevard, perhaps indicative of its 

burned-out, crumbling houses, one after the 

other, interrupted by the occasional vacant 

lot. Even more rare are inhabited homes.

I’ve come to Detroit to make sense of a per-

plexing tendency: What does it mean when 

someone who fits my profile — an educated 

millennial Caucasian — says they “love” 

Detroit, a city whose population is predomi-

nantly Black and remains less affluent than 

residents of the adjacent suburbs? And, what 

is it they love? Do they come to Detroit to 

bask in the recently gentrified districts — a 

hub of nightlife and well-to-do transplants — 

or do they love the city in its entirety, imper-

fections and all? The task of understanding 

all parts of Detroit would take a lifetime.

To understand the city, one needs a point 

of contact. I don’t have friends or family in 

the area, and my peers who frequent Slows 

Bar BQ and the casinos don’t count. I’d basi-

cally be interviewing myself. My most genu-

ine connection lies in my father who grew up 

in Dearborn, Detroit’s immediate neighbor 

to the west. But growing up in Southeast 

Michigan without meaningful experiences 

in the Detroit, I felt fake. So, I’ve set upon 

my own two-day attempt at understanding 

Detroit.

Coming to a halt at Ash, I notice a home-

less man to my left. He’s young, probably my 

age, and holds a sign that reads: “ran away 

from home please help me buy a bus ticket 

God loves a (cereal?) …” The words are too 

small to make out. His oversized apparel 

is covered in dirt and holes. His head bobs 

lethargically up and down, continuously 

bringing him in and out of an asphyxiated 

sleep, all the while wearing an expression of 

sadness to a degree that I can’t explain. The 

closest comparison I can conjure is the face 

of surrender that Johnny Weeks from HBO’s 

“The Wire” always wore. The light turns 

green as Ms. Maps tells me we’ve arrived.

I am greeted by Corktown after turning 

from Ash onto Michigan Avenue. Home to 

the original Slows Bar BQ, Two James Spir-

its, Mercury bar and the hauntingly beauti-

ful Michigan Central Station, this was once a 

repository for Irish fleeing the potato famine. 

Today, it is largely occupied by longtime blue 

collar residents of the city. Corktown evokes 

a sense of authenticity — most of the build-

ings are rough brick and still marked by the 

original hand-painted slogans of old busi-

nesses, there’s a couple abandoned build-

ings, the Marathon gas station is frequented 

mostly by locals from just west of Corktown, 

and crumbling brick-and-mortar expands in 

every direction excluding east, where Down-

town lies.

Corktown technically starts at Rosa Parks 

Boulevard, but the area’s lamppost signs, 

placed at intervals of 30 feet, denote a dif-

ferent cartography starting at 20th Street. 

The only indicator Google Maps appears to 

have used was the stretch of brick road that 

extends barely three blocks to either side of 

the old Tiger Stadium, which is now only a 

baseball diamond on an open field.

Nobody walks in Detroit, at least not in 

Corktown. The city was clearly construct-

ed for the motor vehicle — of which there 

aren’t many in sight either. That’s not to say 

there are no sidewalks. There are plenty, but 

weeds overpopulate crevices in the concrete. 

Today’s absence of pedestrians is no anomaly

Further down Michigan Avenue into 

Downtown is a dead end at Campus Martius 

Park: a favorite stop for day-trip visitors and 

office workers from the suburbs. Women in 

Moncler coats and men in Northface jack-

ets gallivant around the city center enjoy-

ing lattes from Roasting Plant, stopping to 

munch on a Potbelly sandwich while loung-

ing in front of the Michigan Soldiers’ and 

Sailors’ Monument, supported by a backdrop 

of skyscrapers Chicagoan in height. The 

foot traffic is still pathetic by the standards 

of most American cities, but stands in stark 

contrast to deserted sidewalks elsewhere in 

the city.

Detroit is oriented around six main 

thoroughfares that shoot off from Campus 

Martius Park like spokes on a wheel. From 

a bird’s-eye view moving left to right, the 

streets are as follows: Fort Street, Michi-

gan Avenue, Grand River Avenue, Wood-

ward Avenue, Gratiot Avenue and Jefferson 

Avenue. Midtown and the Cass Corridor, the 

gentrified areas of Detroit that lay claim to 

“Detroit’s comeback” can be reached by driv-

ing down Woodward. Today I’ll get to know 

gentrified Detroit. I follow the circular drive 

around the hub and turn on Woodward, 

which penetrates the center of Midtown and 

marks the eastern border of the Cass Corri-

dor.

The early 2000s witnessed a large scale 

effort to reinvigorate the old Cass Corridor, 

which was rebranded as Midtown. Upon 

Detroit’s 2013 bankruptcy, developers inject-

ed huge sums of capital including a $650 mil-

lion plan to purchase and refurbish deserted 

buildings. The result has been a surge in 

luxury outlets and ritzy apartments, accom-

panied by spikes in rent and property valu-

ations that are comparable to gentrification 

in other Midwestern cities, namely Chicago.

Posh bars in rugged buildings are a hall-

mark of gentrification and, like many of Mid-

town’s hotspots, the Selden Standard sits like 

a vesicle stemming the gentrified vein that is 

Woodward Avenue. Three blocks west of the 

thoroughfare, the Selden Standard foreshad-

ows what’s to become of the surrounding 

empty buildings and lots. Across the street is 

one such vacancy, occupied only by an inter-

esting gentlemen clad in a hot-pink cape, red 

jacket and yellow shorts with a banana ham-

mock. He’s holding a boombox that’s blasting 

“Hot in Herre” by Nelly while fist-pumping 

and hip-thrusting. As I walk to the door he 

walks to his campsite, comprised of a towel 

and a pile of clothing. He puts down the 

boombox and continues to dance. We’re the 

only two on the street.

I enter the Selden Standard to find a 

stark contrast in aesthetic: chic black brick 

that matches the exterior, a polished cedar 

bar atop an ebony foundation that matches 

the walls on the left and cedar boards sus-

pended from above by black poles. Sections 

of the ceiling are exposed to allow tasteful 

halogen tubes to descend from black rods. The 

right half of the restaurant contains an exposed 

kitchen and the bar, which is backed by smooth 

and shiny white porcelain bricks. The chairs are 

stainless steel, true to the grayscale backdrop so 

as not to disturb the cedar accents.

The cooks have groomed beards that match 

those of the joint’s patrons, and some have tat-

toos of Celtic patterns or Native American 

totems. Each hostess has perfect “Urban Out-

fitters hair,” I guess you could call it, one with 

a professionally frazzled hipster bob, the other 

sporting 1960s bangs. 

I ask the bartender making my drink how old 

the place is.

“We’re nearing two years in November, which 

is ancient as far as the Detroit food scene goes,” 

she responds.

Her colleague, sporting a man-bun, pipes in, 

“It’s the place to be, man.”

Across the street the dancing man has 

changed into red shorts but continues his ritual. 

He’s moved aside just enough to reveal a white, 

windowless building upon which, in huge type, 

is painted: “Honest?” Before I contemplate 

this irony any further, the customer next to me 

inquires about the dancing man. Apparently 

his name is Terry, and he comes to this spot 

every day to exercise. In doing so he has lost 125 

pounds over two years. “He’s the man,” the bar-

tender says.

When my peers say they spent the weekend in 

Detroit, they usually mean they came here. I’ll 

admit that the area’s perceived safety, quality 

beverages and quirky locals are charming. But 

what constitutes the “love” felt toward a place 

where the dissonance between Terry’s lot and 

this bar is ubiquitous? What does it mean to love 

a city that filed the largest bankruptcy case in 

U.S. history or razed 2,800 buildings, including 

family homes and jazz clubs, to build a highway? 

How does one love the fire hazard of 70,000 

abandoned buildings and 31,000 empty houses, 

an unemployment more than twice the national 

average — 10.4 percent according to the Bureau 

of Labor Statistics — and the way the African-

American community — 83 percent of the popu-

lation — has largely been excluded from enjoying 

the delights of its “resurgence” alongside me? 

The Selden Standard, and its surrounding shops, 

tell a narrative of the comeback kid. Without 

these places there would be even less of a sem-

blance of a local economy, but its presence raises 

property values that push away the very people 

that make up the city’s majority who need help 

the most.

Eric Thomas hates Detroit, a sentiment that 

has, as he puts it, become taboo in and around 

the city. I’ve been quick to defend the city when 

people claim they’re scared of “getting shot.”

“You just don’t know where to go” and “that’s 

an incredibly counterproductive attitude to 

have” were often some of my responses. I now 

regret my patronizing attitude. Thomas, a brand 

strategist and senior partner at at Saga MKTG 

in Detroit, is a native. In his Metro Times edi-

torial Why I Hate Detroit, he concisely articu-

lates what it is he believes people “love”: the four 

miles of Woodward Avenue, the retro Shinola 

watches and the tasteful hotspots like the Selden 

Standard. But most of all, the outsiders that 

these institutions serve love the idea of walking, 

wearing or drinking Detroit, which comes in the 

form of uneducated consumerism.

“And the most notably, downtown devel-

opments by Dan Gilbert, the DEGC, and the 

Detroit Downtown Partnership are infusing the 

economic core of Detroit with energy and all-

around feel good vibes,” Thomas wrote. “But, as 

for the question of opportunity — let’s examine 

what that really means.”

The truth is that my cohort of friends travel-

ing to Detroit to buy posh drinks or attend Tigers 

games does little to affect a school system that 

can’t guarantee pay and basic school mainte-

nance to teachers, repair or construct areas for 

youth recreation, expand mass transit, or inject 

cash into household incomes that are half the 

national average. These new businesses often 

don’t hire locals unless it’s to guard their old 

employees or other outside hires. In sum, the 

words “I love Detroit” mean nothing to locals of 

the poorest city in the nation, who have largely 

been excluded from the economic rejuvenation 

taking place several blocks away in downtown, 

and in the well-to-do suburbs of Oakland and 

western Wayne Counties.

With Thomas’ words ringing in my ears, 

I venture into the neighborhoods surround-

ing Midtown, specifically the neighborhood 

between Trumbull Avenue and West Grand Bou-

levard, and that between West Warren Avenue 

and Mckinley Street. These neighborhoods trade 

places with the other top 10 most dangerous 

neighborhoods on neighborhoods.com — a web-

site which ranks neighborhoods based on crime 

statistics — and contribute greatly, along with 

several other surrounding areas, to Detroit’s 

unflattering — albeit improving — crime figures.

I exit the highway the same as before and 

encounter Johnny Weeks yet again. He’s suited 

in the same garb, with the same sign on the same 

milk crate. This time, however, he’s bobbing his 

head to a different tune, smiling in the same 

spaced-out, euphoric way his television coun-

terpart does when falling victim to the needle. 

Going over the highway and through Corktown, 

around the hub and down Woodward, left on 

Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and right on 

14th Street brings me into the midst of an area 

that resonates with Forbes’ proclaimed haz-

ardousness. It’s hard to describe this neighbor-

hood without using post-apocalyptic clichés. 

Abandoned houses seemed unlimited, which I 

expected, but what I was not expecting is how 

much more bountiful the open lots are. At times, 

nearly 100 yards of overgrown grass separates 

two domiciles, and at others there is only one 

house per block. The only thing that occasional-

ly distinguishes one empty lot from another is a 

scraggly line of unkempt bush, connoting where 

DAY TWO

DAY ONE

a fence should be built, or a series of telephone 

poles on the brink of collapse. Some of these lots 

have an artifact of what used to inhabit their 

space, anything from the remnants of a driveway 

interspersed with weeds to plastic orange and 

blue tricycles.

Dilapidation becomes more visible west of 

Grand River Avenue. The houses that remain are 

sometimes difficult to categorize as inhabited 

or uninhabited at driving speed. One home may 

have boarded windows and a car in the driveway, 

or crumbling front steps with a light on inside, 

while next door sits a house without front steps or 

a car. Paint jobs are not a useful predictor either, 

since all of them would, by normal standards, be 

indicative of abandonment. Often, the most con-

sistent indicator is the collection of play toys, 

plastic chairs and bicycles that are strewn in front 

of the house or even into the street. One house in 

particular had no door or window panes. All that 

remained of another was jagged, three-foot-high 

perimeter of disintegrating charred brick.

One man walks with his arms held perpen-

dicular to the street while never breaking his 

glazed-over forward stare. Others glare at me 

incredulously when I pass by their homes, mak-

ing note of my obvious lack of reason for being in 

their neighborhood.

“People hate it when you drive around and 

gawk,” said my friend who tutors a private-school 

debate team in the area once said.

I wish it would be appropriate for me to explain 

that I wasn’t gawking, but there is no chance of 

that discussion happening, and I think, or hope, 

both parties understand. I’ve been twisting 

through side streets for about an hour and decide 

it’s time to drive to the next neighborhood. I begin 

making my way toward Woodward and was one 

block away when I was suddenly barricaded. In 

front of me is a lightning-blue Ford F-150 with 

chrome rims, tinted windows and a waxed body, 

setting a maximum speed of 4 mph. It’s shameful, 

but the panic I felt was very real, and I’d rather 

not describe the scenarios I imagined would 

ensue. Had I been in almost any other city in 

America I would have been simply irritated, but 

the omnipresent crime statistics and myths that 

surround Detroit cut through rational thinking. 

Two-thirds of the block to go and the pace hasn’t 

changed. My head is now level with the steering 

wheel. Going around such a massive truck on 

these small side streets is impossible, and it would 

probably set off the alarm in someone’s head, but 

I keep contemplating the possibility. One-third 

to go and my knuckles are white, still moving at 

4 mph. At Woodward I make the choice to turn 

on my directional to convey a message that I don’t 

find anything weird, and I am just following traf-

fic laws. He turns left, and I turn right.

I have several hours left on my hands before I 

planned to return home, so I decide to go back to 

Midtown to check out Shinola and its league of 

trendy shops I didn’t get to visit yesterday. Instead 

of tinkering with Midtown’s parking meters, 

which aren’t meters but rather designated zones 

with bothersome rules, I find a space in Will’s 

Leather Goods’s parking lot. The place turns out 

to be part leather goods store, part coffee shop, 
and I enter hoping to find that some kind of 
local craftsmanship has found an outlet here 
on the corner of Alexandrine Street and 2nd 
Avenue. The place is upscale. Leather-bound 
books and wallets sit on top of aromatic pine 
crates in clusters placed around giant ware-
house-like room. Belts hang from pegs driven 
into old wooden pillars. Saddle bags and shoes 
sit in front of the enormous floor-to-ceiling 
window facing 2nd Avenue, which are book-
ended by rusted scooters, helmets, shovels and 
random mining equipment. The place has an 
incredibly invigorating aroma of fresh leather 
and sawdust without the mustiness, which 
makes it cleaner somehow, and wakes me up 
like the sour and slightly sweet smell of Red 
Bull. In the middle is a giant tepee. Yep, made 
of cow’s hide. It stands as tall as the ceiling — 
25 feet. I pass the saleswoman, who greets me 
warmly, and lie that I’m “buying something for 
a friend’s birthday. … No, I’ve never been here 
before.” Part of it was true. I duck behind a 
pole to check out a $75 belt and act interested. 
I don’t really have it in me to fake it today, so 
I decide to go. Tip-toeing around the western 
side of the teepee, I am stopped by Terrance, a

portly gentleman with white pants, smooth 

black leather shoes, some kind of political 

T-shirt, black square-framed sunglasses, and a 

charcoal grey fedora with a yellow-red feather.

“How’s it going, brother?” The words sound 

like those of a honeyed baritone jazz singer. Each 

vowel is a deep bellow that vibrates my ear lobes.

“Well, man. Just in town checking stuff out.” 

I have no idea what to talk about but I want to 

hear more.

“Nice. Nice. You ever hear about our stuff 

before?”

I admit I hadn’t. It’s all handmade leather 

goods, that much is apparent, but virtually 

everything in the store is also for sale, including 

the teepee.

“We were actually way underselling these 

chairs,” he said, pointing to what I thought were 

just for customers to rest on. “They’re actually 

worth about $10,000.”

It turns out that nothing in the store is actu-

ally from Detroit, but instead shipped from the 

parent company in Oregon. Not even the uphol-

stery, teepee or random mining equipment are 

native to Detroit. Every last object in the store 

is scavenged in Oregon, stored in a warehouse 

and then distributed to outlet stores. It’s a very 

determined system. Does selling out-of-town 

wares — as opposed to local crafts — make Will’s 

any less legitimate as a business in Detroit or 

its conscience less an authentic part of the city? 

Why should this place force-fit an image of soli-

darity with the community if it’s just trying to 

be a business? Maybe it’s more honest just to 

sell what they want and not a façade to comfort 

people like me.

“I knew Detroit as a kid when it had the best 

retail store in the state: Hudson’s,” my dad said. 

“When it had the best hobby shop for model 

trains. When the Tigers won the American 

League pennant in 1968, and I rode the bus down 

Michigan Avenue with my grandfather to Tiger 

Stadium.”

He continued: “But I didn’t know Black peo-

ple. My mother taught Black students in Dear-

born Heights, and my father worked with Black 

workers in the Ford Rouge Assembly plant. 

There was tension at my dinner table about race 

because my father would make racist comments 

about his Black co-workers. My mother would 

stop him. It was hard for me to make sense of it. 

I grew up in a white town whose trash cans said, 

‘Keep Dearborn Clean,’ and people often inter-

preted that as ‘keep Black people out.’

It’s uncomfortable, the feeling you get in your 

gut when you hear about family bigotry. How can 

I judge the character of my grandfather, whom 

I’ve never met? My grandmother described him 

as “the kindest man that ever lived,” but how do I 

reconcile these two polarizing narratives?

Needless to say that task was not as hard as 

that of my dad’s, who had to reconcile bigotry 

in a parent. It came as no surprise to me when I 

heard that he hosted a classical music program 

on the Wayne State University radio station 

WDET in 1974 during his undergraduate career 

at the University of Michigan. On Saturdays he 

would drive from campus to Detroit for the 8 

p.m. broadcast.

“After the one-hour show ended at 9 p.m., I 

drove down Woodward Avenue to Eight Mile, 

then west to Livernois where Baker’s Keyboard 

Lounge is located,” he said. “I sat at the bar so 

that I didn’t have to pay the cover charge, and 

forced myself to learn to drink beer so I could sit 

there and listen to Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, Sonny 

Stitt and more. There were regulars at the bar, 

particularly two middle-aged Black guys named 

Skeets and Walter. Those two knew all the 

musicians. … Black and white people got along, 

listening to the beauty of jazz played by master 

musicians. It’s an ancillary aspect of the music 

that always impressed me deeply.”

His volunteering and forced appreciation 

for beer was of course willful, pedagogical and 

enjoyable, but was also threaded with a sense of 

duty. If each generation should attempt to cor-

rect the transgressions of its predecessors in the 

name of progress, this was a noble example. I am 

half the product of someone who was the prod-

uct of Dearborn, which is a product of Detroit, 

who moved to Ann Arbor — itself the product 

of Detroit — and created the foundations for my 

life. I am the latest iteration of this series of rela-

tionships. My bigoted, loving grandfather’s job in 

the auto industry, the college education he pro-

vided his son and trashcans that signaled racial 

exclusion are, for better or worse, what I stand 

upon. Should my actions therefore not contain a 

similar thread of duty to continue the mindful-

ness my father set as a precedent? Is it not my job 

to continue to understand my own narrative as 

it relates to this city, particularly if I’m trying to 

say that I love it?

I made a mistake in trying to capture the 

essence of this city in two days. The narratives 

of Detroit are as numerous as the streets that 

extend from Campus Martius Park. Woodward 

Avenue tells a story of the power of gentrification 

and its complicated benefits; Grand River Ave-

nue portends the future of a Black community as 

it sits poised on the brink of destruction; Michi-

gan Avenue reminisces for the glory days of old 

school baseball, trains and Irish heritage; and if 

I had traveled down Gratiot Avenue, Lafayette 

Street and Fort Street, their stories would have 

made themselves equally known.

But my trip down these thoroughfares has 

also further opened my own story. My father’s 

upbringing in such a tumultuous city has nec-

essarily informed his politics, principles and 

outlook on racial tension, all of which have been 

resources from which I draw my own disposi-

tions. We have never had a catalyst for these con-

versations, and maybe never would, were it not 

for Detroit. I owe it a great deal of thanks, a senti-

ment that one often doesn’t hear about the city.

No narrative is truer than the other, not my 

own nor any of the others. Each trades off the 

myths and facts that surround the city, and 

serve the self-interests of those who adopt them. 

But as my father frequently states: “I’ll say it till 

I die — if someone wants to know what’s hap-

pening in the United States, call me, let’s meet 

at my house at 9:00, go to Detroit by 9:40, drive 

around and have a discussion about what we 

saw at lunchtime.” True affection for Detroit is 

to have a complex relationship, to listen to mul-

tiple narratives for honesty about what’s hap-

pening to the city. It means you need to take that 

drive with my dad. While it may not work for 

everyone, I, whose youth was passed in the tran-

quilities of a college town, one day hope to feel 

sincerity in saying the words: “I love Detroit.”


H

ow did you do it?

Maybe 
how 
isn’t 
the 

right question. The logis-

tics of “how” began when mom filed 
the paperwork and you moved out. You 
belabored the legal process with unlaw-
ful tactics in the courtroom, certainly 
not on behalf of me and my brother. 
The asinine time span — nearly nine 
years — was of your choosing. Were you 
aware the average time to complete a 
divorce is about 11 months? You were 
disrespectful, 
malicious, 
accusatory 

and immature. You neglected us, you 
lied to us, you forced me and Jonathon 
into situations that were unnecessary 
and painful. Throughout the divorce 
process, you did not once ask for par-
enting time. Mom took over the job you 
so quickly disregarded.

Years later, we received notice that 

you were requesting parenting time. 
I was 13, and Jonathon was 17. I didn’t 
want “parenting time” with you after 
the divorce — I didn’t want to “strength-
en” a toxic relationship.

The phrase “parenting time” always 

bewildered me. Shouldn’t the right to 
see your children on a more frequent 
basis be granted to actual parents? It 
boggles my mind that, every day in the 
United States, parenting time is granted 
to parents who have previously over-
looked and recklessly weaseled out of 
their responsibilities.

Parenthood is exemplified by the 

outstanding effort Mom put forth — 
and continues to do so today, mind you, 
despite my legal adulthood. In times of 
hardship, sickness and the ever-return-
ing vengeance of the malignant biologi-
cal father of her children, she’s there. 
Creating and bringing a child into the 
world, although something I have yet to 
experience, is something that requires 
great 
responsibility, 
initiative 
and 

strength. You may have kids, but this 
does not make you a parent. It is up to 
the parents of a child to raise, foster, 
encourage and provide the necessary 
resources within their means to main-
tain the quality of life for that child. Par-
enthood requires effort, selflessness, 
acceptance, 
nurturing, 
spontaneity, 

flexibility and reassurance. Parenthood 
is about instilling in a child a sense of 
confidence, safety and belonging. And 
if the parent does not encourage these 
things, how can the child trust that the 
rest of the world will either?

Mom let you see us frequently on 

the weekends, and encouraged me and 
Jonathon to “have a relationship with 

our father.” Every holiday, she helped 
us arrange time for you to see us, taking 
you into her home to foster a relation-
ship with her children, who — at the 
start of the divorce — were just 6 and 
10. Every chance she had, she tried to 
encourage us — the children she unex-
pectedly had to raise on her own — to 
see our father — the man who disre-
garded her and his responsibilities.

The facts of our case I understand. 

But, considering the standing of our 
relationship, what I possibly might 
never understand is: How did you do it?

I don’t understand how you left your 

wife to take care of your two young 
children on her own with little, if any, 
support. Or how you abandoned your 
home, your responsibilities and forced 
adversity into our lives. Only after seven 
years of having to avoid Father’s Day 
for fear of crying in front of the other 
kids cutting out paper ties for their own 
dads did you decide to emerge from 
an abyss of neglectful and emotionally 
abusive parenting. Only after the “dad-
dy-daughter” dances ended did you 
decide to resurface as an illusory par-
ent, artificially ready to take on the role 
as Dad. Only after you gave Mom no 
other choice but to take on the role as 
not one parent, but two, did you finally 
decide it was time to materialize from 
the proverbial woodwork and dem-
onstrate that you “cared.” It seemed 
as though you intentionally subjected 
me and Jonathon to these moments of 
neglect, just so you could make your 
debut as “Dad” — and even then, only at 
times that were convenient to you. How 
did you do it?

“I want to spend time with you,” you 

told me time and time again when I 
asked why, seven years after the papers 
were filed, you decided to re-enter our 
lives. I found it both painfully comical 
and hard to believe, considering you 
expressed no interest in spending time 
with me between ages 6 and 13.

There is a stigma attached to girls 

who grow up without a father. Peo-
ple see children who are products of 
divorce as less successful, less men-
tally secure and less likely to enter 
into healthy relationships. Fortunately, 
Mom was able to ensure Jonathon and 
I would not be a product of these stig-
mas. I can’t imagine what would have 
happened if she decided to make the 
same decisions you had and refused 
to acknowledge the responsibility that 
she willingly took on. I can’t imagine if 
both of my parents neglected their jobs 
for no reason other than an inability to 
recognize the necessity of selflessness. 
Other children who have experienced 
divorce might not be so lucky to have 
one parent who can do the job of both.

There is a stigma behind girls who 

grow up without a father. I always 
thought it was ironic that girls were 
said to have “daddy issues.” Between 
you and me, I don’t view myself as the 
one who fits into this stigma. After all, I 
have confidence that my mother raised 
me properly enough to know I would 
never have the heart — or lack thereof 
— to abandon my own children.

I was successful throughout high 

school, making way for the fact that I 
now attend a phenomenal University 
— no thanks to guidance and support 
from the paternal side of my lineage. 
I was able to participate in numerous 

extracurriculars throughout childhood 
and adolescence, joining organizations 
and racking up service hours. I was able 
to gain lifelong friendships and foster 
my faith. Despite being cursed with one 
parent who clearly was selfish, imma-
ture and malevolent, I was also blessed 
with an equally selfless, mature and 
benevolent mother who is responsible 
for me becoming the person I am today. 
I’m forever grateful for the opportuni-
ties my mom ensured I could have the 
opportunities you denied me.

Your apathy created a situation 

which forced your own children into 
growing up fast. You denied me of the 
opportunity of having a father, who 
was supposed to take on the role of not 
only dad, but friend, mentor, guide and 
protector. When it came down to it, I 
never had Dad to play baseball with. I 
never had Dad to help me make Mom 
breakfast-in-bed on Mother’s Day. And 
I never had Dad to wait at the front 
door and pretend to intimidate the boy 
I would go on a date with. Even after all 
this turmoil, I still don’t.

Why should you request the rights 

that dads are given, when you never did 
the things a “dad” is supposed to do?

After essentially being absent for 

years, how did you do it?

The day I turned 18, I felt comforted 

by the liberties I would be awarded. 
Mom no longer had to encourage me to 
call you on your birthday, or ask if I was 
going to get you a Christmas gift. I knew 
you could no longer pull any erroneous 
legal shenanigans. I knew I would no 
longer be tied to a past of hating you 
and having parenting time “every other 
Saturday 2-5 p.m. unless the child and 
parent agrees to arrange otherwise.”

Now, years after I last interacted with 

you, I think you probably believe you 
left our home in ashes. You are prob-
ably happy with the way things went 
— you were able to start a new life, leav-
ing Mom, Jonathon and me behind and 
forgotten, disregarded once more. You 
certainly don’t take the phrase “out of 
sight, out of mind” lightly.

Unfortunately for you, I’ve never 

been more content in my life than I 
have in the time I haven’t been forced 
to interact with you. I feel mentally 
refreshed and independent. No lon-
ger do I have the weight of seeing my 
father shackled to my existence. I have 
overcome the stigmas and misconcep-
tions. I have one parent, and a damn 
good one at that. I don’t have you in 
my life. And I’m happy.

I participated in Semester in Detroit in May and June of 2014. Though 
it hasn’t been three years since I moved to the city, every time I go 
back it feels like a different place. Detroit is rapidly changing and 
it has been fascinating to watch these changes unfold. I took these 
during Semester in Detroit, chronicling some of my favorite views of 

the city.

In recent years, Downtown Detroit has undergone rapid change as new apartment buildings are built and businesses move in.
