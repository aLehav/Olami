TRADITION

Detroit network
focuses on business
acumen, diversity
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
For the student-run Detroit
Entrepreneurship Network, the
city of Detroit is ahub of potential
- not just for growing businesses,
but also for creating relationships
that span geographic and socio-
economic boundaries.
The network, known more
casually as d[en], holds an annual
entrepreneurship program for
high school students both from
the heart of Detroit and the city's
suburbs. It recruits students from
18 schools and boasted 50 partici-
pants in 2013.
Established in 2012, the
program has run from mid-
November through April - with
two-hour student- and profes-
sionally-taught business work-
shops held in a Detroit workspace
on a bi-weekly basis.
This year's program will start
in January, later than it has in the
past, in order to align with the

start of the Winter 2015semester.
To compensate for the lost time,
workshops will last three hours
instead of two and the students
involved may consider meeting
on a weekly basis for the first
month.
Business junior Nick Resn-
ick, d[en] co-president, said
the program's mission is two-
pronged. The first part, he said,
is giving students the entrepre-
neurial toolkit to improve their
communities. The second part
goes beyond business acumen to
addressing diversity awareness.
"We want to promote dia-
logue and collaboration between
people of different backgrounds,
different races, socioeconomic
situations, everything like that,"
Resnick said.
"We don't want to just focus on
kids from Detroit. We want to get
high school students from Detroit,
along with across the suburbs, and
bring them to these workshops
and have them work with people
that they would otherwise never
talk to and never get the pleasure
of meeting," he said.
Aside from the workshops,
Resnick said students also split

After rough start,
new system offers

By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
After a shaky start, the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem is settling into its new and
improved filingsystem.
In summer 2012, UMHS made
anenormousshift-moving from
paper medical charts to Epic, an
electronic health records sys-
tem. The UMHS version of Epic
is called MiChart. Two and a half
years later, University Health
Service, the primary source of
health care services for the cam-
pus community, is beginning to
take advantage of Epic and its
many features.
Epic currently holds the medi-
cal records of nearly half the
patients in the United States. A
version of Epic comparable to
UHS' MiChart has been adopted
by every medical center in the
health system. However, in an
interview in September 2013 -

cal impact that is transmitted
through the body.
"It's purely just to develop a
better understanding of running
and how some properties of foot-
wear could affect risk of injury
and things like that," Goulet
said.
Goulet emphasized that play-
ers and coaches benefit from
their participation through the
information obtained from the
data. One example he cited was
a study that involved football
players wearing sensors while
developing an Adidas product
called Speedcell, which is a
sensor worn in the shoe. Using
the data from this research, the
team was able to learn how far
they were running during prac-
tice and how that compared
with how far they actually ran
in a game.
One challenge Goulet he
anticipated was that Adidas
might not want to hear criticism
of their products. He said he was
happy to find that this wasn't the
case, as the team of researchers
he works with at Adidas focuses
solely on innovation. They are
separate from those who bring
products to market and sell
them.
"Fortunately, we are work-
ing with a team who's genuinely
interested in bettering the prod-
uct." Goulet said..
Though the contract between
the two groups is renewed on a
two-year basis, Goulet does not
see any end to this partnership
in sight, as long as all parties are
continuing to benefit from the
research.

"Every time there is a mas-

Pensado noted that in Guer-

tially two governments, the
actual state and the narco-state,
meaning citizens often pay taxes
to both authorities as the link
between legal and illegal activity
becomes increasingly blurred.
"What you have now is peo-

"And this is something that was

Mexico's 'dirty war' of the 1970s
for instance."
He noted that in his expe-
rience people in Mexico have
three reactions toward the
situation: fear, distrust of gov-
ernment and anger that is espe-
cially prevalent among youth.
Pensado noted that 47 out of

From Page 1
the balance, but U.S. Rep. Gary
Peters (D-Detroit) has taken a
commanding lead in the polls over
Republican Terri Lynn Land, for-
mer Michigan Secretary of State.
What was once a four-point lead
in early September has tripled to
a more than 12-point advantage
for Peters, according to the Real-
ClearPolitics aggregate.
Peters, who specialized in
financial issues during his three
terms in Congress, supports rais-
ing the minimum wage and deficit
reduction, favors policies such as
cap-and-trade to combat climate
change and has also campaigned
on his support for abortion rights
and having access to contracep-
tion.
Land, meanwhile, favors lower
tax rates for businesses to stimu-
late economic growth, supports
free-market solutions to combat
climate change, opposes same-
sex marriage, favors restrictions
on abortion and would support
repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Attorney General
Republican Attorney General
Bill Schuette is seeking a second
term as the state's chief legal offi-
cer as he tries to fend off Demo-
cratic challenger Mark Totten, a
law professor at Michigan State

University. Schuette leads Totten
by roughly four points, according
to a Detroit News poll released last
week. Schuette has highlighted
his efforts as a "voice for victims"
in his reelection bid, but has been
criticized by Totten for his sup-
port of a state ban on same-sex
marriage and his challenges to the
Affordable Care Act in court. Tot-
ten hopes to refocus the role of the
Attorney General as "the people's
lawyer" by prioritizing efforts
such as protecting consumers
from predatory business schemes.
Michigan 12th
Congressional District
Rep. John Dingell's (D - Dis-
trict 12) 58-year run in Congress
is coming to an end, but his wife
Debbie Dingell, a former General
Motors executive and a Democrat-
ic party activist, is looking to keep
the seat in the family. She hopes to
fight for women's and children's
issues, increase state support for
higher education and is an advo-
cate forgayrights. OpposingDing-
ell is Republican nominee Terry
Bowman, an assembly line worker
at a Ford Motor Co. plant and the
founder of Union Conservatives,
which seeks to promote conser-
vative principles to union mem-
bers. Bowman supports the state's
right-to-work laws and opposes
the Affordable Care Act for its
potential to incentivize part-time
rather than full-time employment.

No formal polls have been con-
ducted for the race, but Dingell is
heavily favored in this left-leaning
district.
State Senate
In Michigan's 18th senate
district, incumbent Democrat
Rebekah Warren is seeking
reelection against Republican
Terry Linden. Warren previously
served two terms in the state leg-
islature before being elected to the
Senate in 2010 and supportswom-
en's reproductive rights, increased
state support for education, eco-
nomic innovation and expanding
access to healthcare. Information
about Linden's campaign or views
on issues could not be found and
he declined multiple requests for
comment.
State Legislature
Incumbent Democrat Jeff
Irwin is seeking a third term rep-
resenting the 53rd district in the
state legislature and faces chal-
lenger Republican John Spisak, a
former small business owner and
currentastay-at-home father. Irwin
supports increased state funding
for K-12 and higher education, and
supports investing in the physi-
cal infrastructure to promote
economic growth. Spisak's top
priority is to improve the state's
infrastructure and is also an advo-
cate for fiscal responsibility in
government.

FINANCES
From Page 1
governor and U.S. Senate have
been no exception to this trend,
becoming some of the most
expensive in the country. In the
gubernatorial race, $28.8 million
has been spent on television ads
alone, according to the Center for
Public Integrity.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
official campaign has spent $7.6
million, supported by another
$6.5 million from the Republi-
can Governors Association and
$1.3 million from the former
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's Independence USA
political action committee. The
Democratic Governors Associa-
tion has done the majority of the
ad spending for Democratic chal-
lenger Mark Schauer, providing
$8.9 million so far, while Schau-
er's campaign itself has contrib-
uted $2.6 million.
The RGA and DGA are 527
organizations, meaning that
unlike the candidates' official
campaigns, there is no cap on
how much they can accept from
contributors or on how much
they spend. According to the
Michigan Campaign Finance
Network, the largest Michigan
contributor this election cycle
to the RGA was ETC Capital, a
Farmington Hills-based invest-
ment firm that has given roughly
$2.7 million. The DGA's largest
in-state contributor this cycle is
the United Auto Workers, which
gave $1 million.
As expensive as the guber-
natorial race is shaping up to

be, the race for Michigan's open
U.S. Senate seat has proven to
be even more costly. The Center
for Responsive Politics rated it as
the ninth-most expensive Senate
race this election cycle, topping
$46.9 million. Republican candi-
date Terri Lynn Land's campaign
has spent over $11.8 million,
while U.S. Rep. Gary Peters, the
Democratic candidate, has spent
$9.5 million in his campaign.
Just like the gubernatorial
race, outside spending for the
Senate race has outpaced that of
the candidates themselves. Lib-
eral groups either supporting
Peters or opposing Land have
together spent roughly $18.7 mil-
lion, while Conservative groups
supporting Land or opposing
Peters have spent $8.8 million.
The two largest spenders in the
race are the SuperPAC Ending
Spending Action Fund, a con-
servative group advocating for a
reduction in government spend-
ing, and the NextGen Climate
Action, a liberal environmental
group backed by billionaire Tom
Steyer, a hedge fund manager.
Steyer has spent $58 million this
election cycle, the largest single
donor in the disclosed political
system.
While abundant spending
on behalf of both candidates
has distinguished the races for
governor and Senate, lopsided
financial advantages have char-
acterized two other prominent
Michigan campaigns.
In the race for Attorney Gen-
eral, Republican incumbent Bill
Schuette has raised $3.7 million
compared to Democratic chal-
lenger Mark Totten's roughly

$679,000, according to the
Michigan Campaign Finance
Network. Schuette has received
large donations from the PACs
for Decider Strategies, a Republi-
can political consulting firm, and
Detroit law firm Miller Canfield,
as well as the Michigan Beer and
Wine Wholesalers Association.
For Totten, the largest contribu-
tors have been from the PACs for
UAW and the Michigan Educa-
tion Association.
Fundraising in the race for
Michigan's 12th congressional
district has been similarly one-
sided. Democratic nominee Deb-
bie Dingell has raised over $1.3
million compared to just over
$42,000 for Republican Terry
Bowman. According to the Cen-
ter for Responsive Politics, more
than half of Dingell's campaign
war chest-has come from sources
outside the state.
Despite the influx of out-
side money in these races, it is
unclear whether the candidates'
positions have altered as result
of such trends. Traugott noted
that though the current state of
campaign finance has empow-
ered some outside groups with a
narrow issue focus, many of the
groups like the RGA and DGA are
just newer fundraising apparatus-
es ofthe standard political sources
that existed pre-Citizens United.
"I think that the greatest
impact on position-taking comes
from direct contributions rather
than these indirect contribu-
tions," Traugott said. "They have
the ability to contact the (elected
official's) office and remind them
how they supported them during
the campaign."


UHS
From Page 1
very soon after the shift - Doug
Strong, CEO of the University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers, said the health system
was suffering.
"It caused us to slow down
because it was complicated and
people had to learn it," Strong
said. "As a result we were suffer-
ing more financially than we had
been previously ... as we speak
we are resurfacing from that."
UHS Medical Director Rob-
ert Ernst agreed that the change
to MiChart was a major step for
UHS, particularly because they
were transitioning from paper
charts to computers.
"It was a really major shift
in our practice when we moved
from paper records to an elec-
tronic record system," Ernst
said. "And I don't think you can
underestimate the disruption."
Two and a half years later,
UHS members have become
much more comfortable with
the inner workings of MiCh-
art. With familiarity has come
success, and in many ways
the UHS online system is
thriving and nearly all of the
paper charts have been moved
online.
"People who have been users
of this system have had an oppor-
tunity to build a record, and that
took some time," Ernst said.
"There were instances when
we were working with both the
paper record and the electronic,
and we've kind of grown out of
that now."
Electronic records have
resulted in bidirectional com-
munication between the health
care provider and the patient.
Using an online health portal,
MyUofMHealth.org, students
can request prescription renew-
als, view test results and make
appointments. Previously, stu-

dents had to call or even come to
UHS to perform these tasks.
The convenience of care has
brought increased patient satis-
faction. Ernst said patient satis-
faction with ability to view test
results was 70 percent without
the portal. Since then, this num-
ber has now climbed to 90 per-
cent.
"That addresses what we had
known as a gap," Ernst said.
"We've really made a tangible
improvement in that."
UHS is still looking to improve
student usage of the portal,
which about half of students
currently use. UHS has taken
measures such as putting portal
information on business cards
and having kiosks at checkout
with computers for patients to
make portal accounts.
Though 50 percent of patients
are actually using the por-
tal, only 5 percent are making
appointments through it. Ernst
said he is looking to increase this
number over time.
UHS is the only site within
UMHS that offers patients the
option of scheduling an appoint-
ment online. Ernst is an advo-
cate of this feature particularly
because it encourages continuity;
patients can only make appoint-
ments with a doctor they have
seen in the past, a feature that
is supported by studies indicat-
ing a link between a consistent
patient-doctor relationship and
better quality of care.
"It's not as intuitively obvious
to most students that they would
benefit from continuity until
they've had it," Ernst said. "Then
they really find it to be satisfy-
ing."
The biggest challenge that
persists with the online system
is internal communication with-
in UHS, Ernst said. Rather than
making a phone call or going
to see them in person, doctors
can contact their medical assis-
tants and nursing staff through

the system, and Ernst said staff
members are still working out
this part of the routine.
"It has become almost some-
thing else to do," he said.
Epic is not a simple system.
Ernst said there are other, less
advanced systems that are tai-
lored specifically to college
health centers and might be eas-
ier to work with initially. How-
ever, Epic's functionality results
in greater efficiency once its
capabilities are well understood.
UHS is now reaching that point.
UHS has begun to launch
screening algorithms to encour-
age protocol-based features such
as STI screenings for women.
Ernst said this functionality
has greatly improved efficiency
because it takes advantage of
a patient's presence at UHS. A
patient can receive - or at least
schedule - the routine check
that day.
"That is the high-end Epic
functionality that is not associ-
ated with the off-the-shelf, more
tailored college health electronic
records," Ernst said.
The use of Epic is also crucial
because it allows UHS to be on
the same system as the rest of the
University hospitals. This would
not be the case if UHS were using
the less complex programs typi-
cally meant for college health
systems.
"The fact that we're using the
same system as the medical cen-
ter has really eliminated this loss
of information," Ernst said. "If
a student goes to the emergency
room ... that sort of sharing of
information when there needs
to be sharing of information has
been fantastic."
MiChart is continually becom-
ing a useful tool for UHS. Just
last week, UHS launched online
nutrition services.
"We've really settled in now,"
Ernst said, "so we're much more
efficient with it than we've been
before."

into teams and develop products
that they pitch to a panel of pro-
fessional mentors.
Ultimately, one team wins the
"competition," earning a $400
prize. How the winners use the
money is up to their discretion.
Last year's program had two
winners. One winning team
designed a product called Graf-
fiti Gowns, medical gowns that
can be drawn on, as a way to
engage younger children in hos-
pital environments.
Resnick said this team used
some of its prize money to con-
sult with a patent lawyer and try
to patent a washable material for
the gowns.
"The end goal, really, is to give
what we envision the promising
team from our workshop money
so that they can continue to
have resources to continue this
work," he said. "We just want to
see these students empowered
to go on their own."
Resnick added that even
those who do not win funding
are given the tools to succeed.
Not all projects set out to cre-
ate products - others include
valuable services, such as local
tutoring or community service
organizations.
Once the program ends, Resn-
ick said many of the projects go
on to be implemented, and par-
ticipants stay in touch with their
fellow students and mentors
through Facebook groups and
over e-mail.
One example is LSA sopho-
more Monica Mungarwadi, who
was a student in the program

during her senior year of high-
school and is now a member of
d[en]. Her group project was
called the Middle School Initia-
tive, which would recruit stu-
dents from middle schools to
take part in a diversity education
program centered on race and
ethnicity.
The initiative was success-
fully launched last year in her
hometown of Farmington Hills.
She said the skills she learned in
the d[en] program were invalu-
able ingettingthe Middle School
Initiative going. y
"One of the first things that
I learned was writing a busi-
ness model," she said. "I had
never even heard what a busi-
ness model was. That helped a
lot because it helped us struc-
ture our organization: what our
main goal was, what our mission
statement was, how much money
we wanted to put towards our
program, how to get the funding
that we needed."
Tom Frank, executive direc-
tor of the University's Center
for Entrepreneurship, who was
a guest judge at last year's con-
cluding d[en] competition, said
a couple of teamseven sought
his mentorship after the pro-
gram came to an end. He hap-
pily extended it and said he was
impressed by the program over-
all.
"Two of these high school
teams presented the best startup
ideas that I had seen all year,
and one of them I would have
invested my personal money in if
that was not completely outside
of our conflict of interest," Frank
said, referring to Graffiti Gowns.
Frank said high school stu-
dents yield innovations that go

beyond the sometimes-cookie
cutter version of "entrepreneur-
ship" that is often prevalent at
the university level, which tends
to focus on tech startups.
"People solve problems that
reflectthe world thattheyilive in,
and the problems that we were
presented by the d[en] students
were really cool to me because
they came from a completely
fresh perspective," he said.
Frank said the sentiment was
also visible recently at the CFE's
Urban Entrepreneurship Ini-
tiative Symposium, where, he
said, many Detroit natives were
present. The initiative encour-
ages sustainable business meth-
ods for solving important urban
issues and was founded by David
Tarver, a lecturer at the College
of Engineering and the CFE.
"The things that they cared
about around financing are not
the same things that somebody
who's commercializing a laser
in one of our research labs cares
about," Frank said. "So there
again, you get the benefit of this
feedback from the community:
'Don't set up a venture capital
storefront ... show me how I can
finance the next phase ofgrowth
so I can manufacture this thing
I've created.'"
Tarver also taught a d[en]
workshop last year, which pro-
vided an overview of methodolo-
gies for growing a business. This
is one of his areas of expertise
- he has successfully developed
numerous profitable businesses,
namely Telecom Analysis Sys-
tems, which he started in his
basement with two friends and
ultimately sold for $30 million.

DEMOCRATS

age students to vote this election
cycle, especially because non-
presidential elections are known
for attracting fewer voters. Many
of the candidates cited low voter
turnout among young voters as
the reason for substantial Demo-
cratic losses in the 2010 midterm
elections.
"We need you tomorrow,"
Dingell said to the cheering
crowd. "We've got to take the
state legislature back. We are here
tonight to create the energy, to
create the enthusiasm to remind
your roommates and the people
and in your houses and in your
dormsthattomorrow matters and
what's at stake."
Schauer said he believes the
student vote will push Democrats

ahead in the election.
"I am an optimist about our
future and I trust you with the
future of this state," Schauer said.
"It is in your hands and I am com-
pletely comfortable with that."
After the rally, the College
Democrats posted flyers and
chalk messages around campus.
"We're doing everything we
can to make sure that if you're a
student at the University of Mich-
igan, you know that it is Election
Dayandyouknowwhothe Demo-
crats are," Culbertson said.
In addition to encouraging stu-
dents to vote, many candidates
discussed their positions on fun-
damental issues like the environ-
ment, women's rights, health care
and LGBTQ rights. Many candi-
dates also discussed their goals
for empowering the people over
big business and corporations.
"This is really a critical elec-

tion to show that big money can't
buy elections," Peters said. "It is
the people of the state of Michi-
gan who get to determine who
their Senator is, who their Secre-
tary of State is, who's their Attor-
ney General, not these out of state
billionaires."
Culbertson said that the state
elections, and especially the guber-
natorial race, are still very impor-
tant for out-of-state students.
"We're voting for someone who
is going to sign the state budget
for higher education and sign the
road funding, and they're going to
be signing bills of anti-discrim-
ination legislation," Culbertson
said. "Even if you're only going to
be on campus for four years, all of
those things will and should mat-
ter to you. I think this election
is incredibly important and it's
incredibly important to show up
on Election Day."

I've been to more Republican campaign
events that I can reasonably recall. Hav-
inginterned and volunteered for ahandful
of local candidates, I'm used
to the large crowds amped up
on the idea that, after Elec-
tion Day, society might begin
to change for the better.
I'm also the last person
you'd expect to find at a
Democratic rally featuring
President Barack Obama.
But, three days before VICTORIA
the election, in a crowded NOBLE
gym filled with cheering
supporters for Michigan's
bluest candidates, that's exactly where I was.
I watched passionate devotees erupt with
hope and excitement as candidates promised
wider access to quality education, middle
class-centric policies, a better economy with a
booming job market and a fairer government
less controlled by special interests. At several
pointsinthespeech,Iwastemptedtosmile and
cheer with the crowd - though my yellow press
pass and frequent self-reminders to maintain a
journalist's fagade of impartiality (hopefully)
prevented those reactions.
For a good portion of each candidate's and,
subsequently, Obama's speech, the focus was
on issues and policies that consistently poll
favorably among most Americans, regardless
of political orientation. At several moments,
if someone had told me Obama's words were
actually those spoken by his presidential oppo-
nent two years ago, I would've believed them.
As normal, rational citizens, there are just
certain things we can all get behind. The real
economic progress described by Obama really
isn't so divisive. And I'm fairly sure that leaders
valuing the "hard work and responsibility that
the ordinary people they represent take with
them every single day when they go to the job,"
appeal to voters on both sides of the aisle.
Yet, Obama made a concerted effort to'
differentiate Democratic candidates from their
Republican opponents. He did this by painting
them as anti-family, anti-worker and anti-
women. He conflated and (unfairly) compared,
even quoting, sans context, an unidentified
Republican candidate, who said, "You could
argue that money is more important for men."
After a quick Google search, I found that the
quote was given by the Assistant Majority
Leader of the Wisconsin state Senate Glenn
Grothman in 2012.
Obama was giving a campaign speech in
front of a base of supporters, not an address to
the nation, and firing up the crowd just domes
with the territory. Sometimes making dramatic
statements is the best way to do that. But, in
a few days, the election will be over. Those
feelings, that animosity stirred by aggravating
statements pitting leaders against their
constituents won't fade just because one party
or the other has decisively won.

In one part of his speech, Obama focused
on the progress that this state has recently
realized. But, instead of properly giving credit
tc the swaths ofpolicymakers at everylevelwho
contributed to these impressive improvements,
he politicized it.
"Despite the unyielding opposition of folks
on the other side, there are workers who have
jobs today who didn't have them before," he
said. "There are auto plants that got shifts that
weren't there before."
The tension that characterizes the
relationship between Republican and
Democratic parties, especially at the national
legislative level, is undeniable. But even so, any
assertion that either party alone is responsible
for Michigan's economic recovery, or that one
side accomplished it in spite of the other, is
unequivocally false.
Obama and the Democrats certainly aren't
alone in their use of dichotomous and partisan
language. But, when Obama was campaigning
in2008,he characterizedhimselfas abipartisan
leader, so his move toward divisiveness in
this election is particularly disappointing.
One quote was particularly condescending
and off-putting.
"Republicans are good people, they're
patriots. They love their country ... But they've
got bad ideas," he said. "And I always try to
explain - look, I've got members of my family
who I love and have bad ideas. I still love them.
I just wouldn't put them in charge."
Ironically, so many of both parties' ideals,
if not the ideas themselves, are strikingly
similar. And that's not to say that there aren't
differences - there are. But effective policy
will draw from both parties' platforms - it's
what our government was designed to do.
By characterizing Republicans so negatively
now, it only reduces the prospects of
future cooperation.
A few weeks ago, I listened to University
Regent Kathy White give atalk on leadership.
One lesson she gave really stuck in my mind:
there's no limit to what you can accomplish
if you don't care who gets credit. It's
abundantly clear that Michigan's economic
recovery is the result of interplay between
Republican and Democratic ideas. Instead
of highlighting their differences, leaders
from both parties should recognize that
real, continued progress will require serious,
pragmatic collaboration - not opportunistic
criticism aimed at winning votes.
In a few days, the competition will be over.
It will be time to put aside the differences,
forget the negative advertisements and move
past antagonizing words. But, no matter
who is elected, our new leaders will have a
responsibility to focus on the most important
thingboth partieshaveincommon:the people
they serve.

've never been a huge Renee
Zellweger fan. Maybe it was
her character in "Chicago,"
in which she
plays a mousy,
manipulative
and popularity-
hungry girl. Or
maybe it was
because I never
got in to the whole
"Bridget Jones's
Diary" fad. But
regardless of my LEVINE
preconceived
notions about
this tiny blonde actress, I would
never wish upon anyone the kind
of agony and humiliation she is
currently enduring.
Despite her statements saying
she doesn't mind that the press
is abuzz with chatter about her
"new look," I can tell she must be
hurt. How could she not? Recently
"legitimate" media outlets (i.e. not
tabloids) have been chock-full of
pictures of Zellweger, comparing
her face from what it looked like in
the past to how it looks now, which
is apparently "unrecognizable"
and therefore newsworthy. These
images went viral over the past
couple of weeks, and it seemed as
though everyone had something
to say about how this 45-year-
old woman looks. I'm not only
disgusted and embarrassed for her
but also ashamed of our country
for portraying a woman in such a
light. Why are we not celebrating
her recent book? Instead we are too

obsessed with the body and face of
a woman first and foremost. God
forbid we peek into her intellect
without first examining her
physical appearance. To me this
incident says a lot about how we
treat women in America.
I'm not a fan of plastic surgery
personally, but I can understand
how it could make some people
feel more confident about their
bodies. Admittedly, plastic surgery
embodies everything anti-feminist
in my mind, but if it empowers
any particular woman to feel more
confident, then I refuse to judge
her choice to change her body. If it
will make her still feel sexy as she
ends her youth and enters middle
age, then so be it. Throughout the
past couple of weeks, media outlets
have been hounding Zellweger,
talking about different procedures
she must have had done in order to
look a certain way. Her response
was, "I'm glad folks think I look
different! I'm living a different,
happy, more fulfilling life, and I'm
thrilled that perhaps it shows."
If your best friend said this after
you noticed she looked different,
wouldn't you be happy for her?
Wouldn't you stop wondering what
she did differently (if she didn't
want to tell you) and just be happy
that she feels positively about
herself? I'm not saying Zellweger
is any of our best friends but we
should still cut her a little slack.
I'll admit we can't deny that we see
a difference in Zellweger's look.
That would be denying our human

nature to notice details. But human
nature doesn't dictate the nasty
comments that have ensued since
pictures surfaced. If she chooses
to look a certain way, she should be
allowed to. If she is aging gracefully
or not, depending on your opinion,
it doesn't really matter because
apparently Zellweger herself thinks
that her life is more fulfilling. She's
now more comfortable with her
body. It's like that scene in "Mean
Girls" where Tina Fey's teacher
character Ms. Norbury tells the girls
in the gym, "There's been some girl-
on-girl crime here." The way women
are caring about Zellweger's new
look exemplifies that.
In America women are expected
to look youthful and sexy, otherwise
they aren't considered beautiful.
That idea stays in place until they get
too old. Then the tables are turned,
and you're no longer supposed to look
youthful, vivacious or sexy anymore.
Women,whetherornotthey're inthe
public eye, are expected to embody
the modestly dressed, conserva-
tive grandmother once they reach
middle age. With sex appeal gone, it .
seems our culture rejects women for
everything except being good home-
makers or wise maternal figures. But
women aren't just their sex appeal
or their wise brain. Women can stay
sexy well into middle age so long as
they feel confident and comfortable.
That's exactly what Renee Zellweger
is doing, and I applaud her for it.

witless homeless kid named Rick
(RizAhmed,"IllManors"), whose

Somewhat mitigating the film's

is its excellent sense of tension.

Alice Walker will serve as
the guest lecturer for this
year's Zora Neale Hurston
Lecture, an annual event
presented by the Department
of Afroamerican and African

Michael Awkward, a DAAS
professor and founder of the
Zora Neale Hurston Lecture,
spoke about the creation of the
event, now in its 20th year.
"I started the series in
1994 when I was director of
Afroamerican and African
Studies feeling that the unit,
and the University, needed
a major annual event to
showcase the breath and
depth of the field," Awkward
said. "Hurston, an American
novelist, essayist, a playwright
and anthropologist whose
interests spanned the African
diaspora,-medt s the perfect
symbol of the expansiveness of
the field of Black or Africana
Studies."
While many of us have read
Hurston's classic "Their Eyes
Were Watching God" at some
point in our academic careers,
for many years, Hurston
and her work sat in relative
obscurity. In fact, it was
largely through Alice Walker's
research and writings that
Hurston's writings were
rediscovered.

Imagine waking up every
day with no memory of the
past twenty years of your life.
Every night,
your mind
erases the
previous day Before
and every I Go to
morning
you're forced Sleep
to trust the
stranger Re and
sleeping next Quality16
to you. Such Clarius
is the premise
behind
"Before I Go to Sleep," only
the latest thriller to feature an
amnesiac.
There's a good reason why so
manythrillers,fromHitchcock's
"Spellbound" to Christopher
Nolan's "Memento," rely on of
memory loss as the plot driver.
Our memories make up our
personality; they give us a sense
of continuity and purpose.
Without our memories, we lose
control of our destinies and
ourselves. We can't know truth
from falsehood or whom to
trust.
In "Before I Go to Sleep,"
an amnesiac named Christine
(Nicole Kidman, "Eyes Wide

Shut") struggles to recollect
her past with the aid of a
neurologist, Dr. Nasch (Mark
Strong, "Green Lantern").
Dr. Nasch reveals that she
sustained a terrible brain
injury during a vicious attack
years ago, and together they
work to remember the details
of the attack. Unfortunately,
her husband Ben (Colin Firth,
"The King's Speech") strongly
opposes her digging up old
memories. Every day, each
secret Christine uncovers must
be relived by the couple as a
fresh trauma.
Solid performances by
the leads keep the film
engaging and the outcome
uncertain. Though bordering
on melodrama with the
remembrance of old tragedies
and clandestine affairs,
the plot stays emotionally
taut until the climax. The
revelation of one drama after
another pulls the viewer
along at a rapid pace, and the
actors almost make the cliches
bearable. Like the web of
lies ensnaring Christine, the
holes in the story only become
visible when examined too
closely.
Fittingly, "Before I Go to
Sleep" often feels disorienting.
Scenes jump around, making


time difficult to track. Like
a slideshow on fast-forward,
Christine's mind flits
through tantalizingly vague
images: a passionate lover, an
identifying scar, a champagne
bottle descending towards her
head. Phantom voices haunt
her, echoing just out of reach.
The more she unravels of her
past, the more the threads of
memory twist in her grasp.
Disappointingly, the
revelations come with the side
effect of making the plot feel
contrived. Rather than stick to
any hard rules, the story bends
Christine's condition to fit its
needs. It builds relationships
that Christine should be
incapable of. All in all, the
film's treatment of memory
loss doesn't feel as real as in
"Memento."
Though the twists keep the
viewer uncertain, the climax
fails to provide much of a
shock. The deception possesses
great depth, but the small
red herrings along the way
never fully divert attention
from the prime suspect. In a
similar manner, "Before I Go
to Sleep" proves an adequate
diversion, but once the credits
roll, it probably won't stick in
anyone's memory, amnesiac or
not.

Calvin Harris's new
album leaks classic
techno dance tunes
By MELINA GLUSAC
DailyArts Writer
If anyone's the king of
dance-y dub, it's the enigmatic,
gruffly-voiced
DJ Calvin
Harris. Radio
listeners know Motion
him from that Calvin Harris
inescapable,
unexpected Columbia
hit "Feel So
Close" and,
more recently, "Summer." These
pleasant, .harmless techno
grooves are exactly what Harris
brings on his newest release
of happy-go-lucky club jams,
Motion. So the album lives up
to expectations - but it doesn't
exceed them.
Tunes like "Summer" and
"Under Control" have already
peaked on the U.K. and
U.S. charts. The beautifully
atmospheric "Slow Acid" was
also previously released prior to
the album. These songs are not
necessarily the strongest on the
album, but they've lived up to
their hit potential. "Pray to God,"
Harris's killer collaboration with'
the bad-ass, all-female rock-pop
group HAIM, could also be a
smash; its fusion of great beats,
cool synths and guitar build-
up a la Stevie Nicks's "Edge of
Seventeen" leaves the listener

wanting more.
The only rap on the album,
"Open Wide" with Big Sean,
is stellar - Sean's witty, laid-
back, cocky lyrics blend well
with Harris's perfect techno
accompaniment. This isn't the
case with the other collabs,
though, and the ones with
the most hype tend to fall the
flattest. "Outside," featuring
Ellie Goulding, is blissfully
unoriginal - a formulaic track
laced with Goulding's signature
soulful-whispery-mouse-on-
crack vocals. The strength of
the synths and the epic-ness of
the drop overpower Goulding
by miles. A track like this needs
someone like Mariah Carey to
power through the excess.
So many of Motion's songs
plummet into the depths of
familiarity, the signature-
Calvin-Harris, typical-EDM
hole. "Together," featuring Gwen
Stefani, doesn't deviate from the
norm at all - it's repetitive and
difficult to separate from ditties
like "Faith" and "Love Now."
Harris doesn't allow Gwen a
chance to show her punky flavor
at all. Instead, she's trapped
behind a"dub"blegum pop
number with a melody so simple
Britney Spears could sing it just
as effectively. No doubt there.
The album hits a sultry,
intimate spot for a few minutes
with "Ecstasy." This track,
unmatched by any others, is a
ballad etched with spotless lead
vocals and soft techno insertions
that don't get overwhelming.
Harris has the listener on the

edge of their seat, basking in the
initially jarring, gentle light of
the song and wondering if a drop
is ever going to come. It doesn't
(thank goodness). When it comes
to music, the benefits of straying
from the status quo are infinite;
Harris should've included more
of this inventiveness.
"Blame" with John Newman
is decent, once again steered
by the power of a strong male
vocalist. Newman's soul is
undeniable and the song shines
a little bit more than the others
because of it. Other tracks -
"It Was You" - fade into the
electronic dust.
Of the three all-instrumental,
no vocal tracks, "Slow Acid" is
the darkest, most futuristic and
strongest. It weaves and takes
some unexpected melodic turns,
unlike "Burnin" (with R3hab)
and "Overdrive" (with Ummet
Ozcan), which are unendingly
boring.
The biggest upset is Harris
and newcomer Tinashe's "Dollar
Signs," another characteristic
jam. The listener yearns for
something great, something to
match the effortlessly fly vibes
of Tinashe's first hit, "2 On." But
"Dollar Signs" is so confused,
complete with a huge, hardcore
drop that mismatches Tinashe's
cutesy, chill vocals in the verses.
All of it - all of Motion -
is current. There are dollar
signs in Calvin Harris' future.
But he shouldn't be under the
impression that he's acquiring
that green from being good. It's
all just catchy shit.

coat should I wear today, my
portable sleeping bag or the airy,
windbreaker?" - style knows no
season, especially when it comes
to jewelry. Classic concepts reign
supreme this season, but that
still leaves room for expressing
individuality.
In a quest to find the perfect
set of fall jewelry, I looked no
further than Neiman Marcus at
Somerset Collection in Troy, MI.
I interviewed Kristina Bazzi, a
jewelry consultant of Neiman
Marcus, who shared the hottest
trends for fall jewelry.
It's nearly impossible to walk
into a jewelry carrier without
seeing a vast selection of symbolic
jewelry. Ranging from Hamsas
to four-leaf clovers, the current
trend caters to all.
Brands such as Alex and Ani
offer more affordable examples
of symbolic jewelry, including a
vast selection of their signature,
adjustablebraceletsandnecklaces
in both silver and gold. Sydney
Evan is a pricier option, but
includes a more varied selection
with beaded pieces and jeweled
charms.
"Wehave symbolic jewelrylike
the evil eye, that is huge, and it's
been huge since 2011," Bazzi said.
"A lot of people use it because they
like what it symbolizes, which is
protection. So it became more of a
fashion statement now."
Obviously, doting emblems

This city is undoubtedly home

We're a hard-working collection

of that focus necessary for ahigh-

up to that little browncup of bit-

American drinks three cups a day,

businesses justly compensating
farmers and workers in develop-
ing countries instead of exploit-
ing them for profit as many large
corporations do. These businesses
work directly with the farmers
who grow the cropsthey will use
and sell, ensuringthatthey're
grown sustainably and organi-
cally. Fair trade is, in a way, the
epitome of anti-capitalism: the
workers at the bottom of the
production chain are paid fairly
for their contribution to the busi-
ness, instead of being dragged in
the dust by the bigwigs at the top.
While this entire process can seem
so far from our daily routines
and our simple need for a shot of
espresso, it's importantto realize

the power we can have all the way
in Ann Arbor just by choosingsus-
tainable options.
While it's not practical to inter-
rogate your local barista about the
facts of where their coffee beans
are grown and how much the
farmers are paid per shipment, it's
not so difficult to do your research
about which of your favorite coffee
shops use fair trade ingredients.
Fair trade options are plentiful in
Ann Arbor, as long as you know
where to look. Businesses who
utilize fairtrade are usually proud
of this fact and promote it when
possible, since it's aprettyawe-
some business strategy:you'll reel
in people who consider themselves
environmentally friendly and
sustainable, and the people who
could care less won't think less of
your shopbecause of it. Espresso
Royale buys their coffee from
"Crop-to-Cup," an importer that
buys organic beans directly from
farmers in developingcountries,
and reward them with fair pay for
practicing environmentally sus-
tainable practices. Smaller shops
like Elixir Vitae Coffee and Tea
have fair trade options if you ask.
The options are there if you know
where to work, and the whole
process is a win-win situation,
win-win-win if you think about
the workers who benefit from fair
wages.
Coffee isn't a luxury for many
people. It's a necessity. Coffee
fuels our work, our successes
and keeps us functioning for our
8 a.m.'s as well as our nights out
with friends. Coffee drives our
educations, our artistic endeavors
and, occasionally, our failures. For
a beverage so present in our lives,
we mightas well make choices in
our purchasing histories that may
have little difference for ourselves,
but could greatly change the well-
being of someone working in agri-
culture a world away. Fair trade is
the building block for buildingup
poor communities, startingwith
families, then communities and
then finding the power to change
entire populations for the better.
It's a small step, but every one of
us has the power to help a commu-
nity just by our pre-class choice of
where to pick up a latte.

As lone senior, Bielfeldt
hopes to make impact

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Corinne Harris has played in all 23 games for Michigan this year. She has 15 points and has tallied 23 shots on goal.
Harris emerges as veteran
leader for youngz Wolverines

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
By quickly scanning the
Michigan men's basketball
team's roster, one might notice
a couple things. Yes, there are
12 underclassmen on the team.
Correct, Caris LeVert and Spike
Albrecht are the only juniors.
And lastly, forward Max
Bielfeldt is the lone senior on
the squad. However, until mid-
July, that wasn't true.
It wasn't until July 17 that
Bielfeldt and Michigan coach
John Beilein decided to change
his classification from a redshirt
junior to a senior, opening up
another roster spot in the 2015
recruiting class.
"We had a meeting and he
said, 'We're going to list you as
a senior,' " Bielfeldt said. "I was
fine with it. I'm just looking to
have the best year I can."
For Bielfeldt, this season
represents his best opportunity
to play a pivotal role for the
Wolverines.
After taking a redshirt in
the 2011-12 season, Bielfeldt
played in 20 games the next
season, tallying 23 points and
31 rebounds total in 5.3 minutes
per game. For a while in the
2013-14 season, it was thought
Bielfeldt's minutes could
increase after former Wolverine
forward Mitch McGary had
season-ending back surgery, but
that didn't hold true.
Instead, Bielfeldt played just
89 minutes, usually only when
JordanMorgan andJonHorford
got into foul trouble - such
as in the Big Ten Tournament
Championship game against
Michigan State and during the

second half of Michigan's Elite
Eight game against Kentucky.
But a door opened for Bielfeldt
when McGary declared for the
NBA Draft, Morgan graduated
and Horford transferred to
Florida. He wouldbe the lone big
man with collegiate experience
coming back to Michigan.
With such a major
opportunity for minutes, this
season represented the chance
to show what he had left,
while competing with redshirt
freshman Mark Donnal and
incoming freshmen Ricky Doyle
and D.J. Wilson.
However,
before
competition ,
could even Iit
start, Bielfeldt
underwent door s o
hip surgery in
early June that
kept him out
for the team's
four-game
Italy trip in August. While the
operation and opportunity to
play in Italy could have been
seen as a setback, Bielfeldt said
it felt it would help in the long
run - especially in terms of
improving his leadership and
health.
"I've kind of been struggling
with the whole hip (and) knee
issue for my college years here,"
he said. "And I felt I could finally
benefit more from getting that
surgery done. This summer, it
was a little weird, because the
guys were doing the Italy trip
stuff and I was there doing'
senior support. So I had a little
different role.
"But overall, I think it was
a great idea. I'm feeling great.

I'm just working on getting my
explosiveness back, like the
speed I had before. I know the
ceiling's higher. I can feel when
I'm doing stuff that I have more
of an ability to keep working
hard."
Bielfeldt isn't alone in his
progression and confidence.
Beilein said at the team's awards
banquet in April that Big Ten
opponents were going to learn
"nobody can guard" Bielfeldt.
Hyperbolic or not, Bielfeldt
believes now that he is
100-percent healthy, he can
make a significant difference on
the court.
"I think
I have the
nk the opportunity
to (have
pen with my most
.ea impactful
year)" he
said. "I think
the door's
open with
my health, along with the guys
we have and my position as a
leader."
Though Bielfeldt said he will
contribute more than ever on
the court in his final season at
Michigan, he knows for certain
the impact he has off the court
on his new teammates is as
important.
"We have a lot of guys that
need advice," he said. "As a
person that's been through it,
from academics to athletics or
anything, I think me and the
other upperclassmen are just
trying to advise them as much
as possible because we have a
lot of young souls that really
have no idea what it takes to be
a college student-athlete."

By MATTHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
With the Michigan women's
soccer team graduating its most
decorated senior class last year,
including eight of its starters,
coach Greg Ryan needed
someone to step up.
After having thought
about it over the summer and
discussing the
idea of taking

Corinne p1
Harris took Confd
the initiative
and sent Ryan
an e-mail
saying she was
ready to do more - ready to
make more of an impact on the
team.
Every athlete takes her own
amount of time to mature into
who she truly is. The process can
depend on many things - not
only the athlete's personality
but also the situation the athlete
is placed in. This can take some
players a couple weeks. Others,
a few years.
For Harris, it took two years
for her to lead Michigan, and
herself, in the manner she feels
most confident with.
"Every year, I have tried to
take on the biggest role that I
can, and this year, I am taking
more of leadership role," Harris
said. "I think I have a lot more
confidence being in the center
of the field than I did when I
was a freshman. Each year is a
different role, but having more
experience gives you more
confidence."
Harris recorded 19 points in
her first two years combined
and has recorded 15 points this
year alone, with three goals and
nine assists. She is also tied for
second in the Big Ten in assists,
only trailing fellow Wolverine
Ani Sarkisian. Harris carried
this team to a surprising third-
place finish in the Big Ten and
has shown her true potential
this season as a player and
leader with the experience and
confidence to step into a much

bigger role.

Hoke not concerned with job status

FOOTBALL RECRUITING
Michigan picks up
ninth 2015 recruit

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
has never worried about his job
status, even as his team sits 4-5
this season.
And even after his boss
resigned,
he's still not NOTEBOOK
backing down
from that stance.
"I've never been concerned
about a job, ever, and I never will
be," Hoke said Monday. "Because
if I get concerned about a job,
then you get distracted. ... If I
get distracted, I'm not being fair
to those kids who haven't been
distracted."
Dave Brandon, who resigned
onFridayfromhisrole asAthletic
Director, was responsible for
hiring Hoke and had publicly
supported the coach. In the
interim, University President
Mark Schlissel appointed Jim
Hackett to replace Brandon.
Hoke said he found out
about Brandon's resignation
from Brandon himself Friday
but declined to discuss what
was said.
"I have a lot of respect for
Dave," Hoke said. "From a
reaction standpoint, he did a lot
of good things for the University,
and now I'm real excited to work
with Jim."
Hoke, who said he has only
briefly spoken with Hackett
after the meeting, said he would
have a longer conversation
"sometime sooner than later"
with his new boss. The two have
met in prior meetings at multiple
events, according to Hoke, but he
wouldn't elaborate on how much
they've discussed the future.
"We've got Northwestern (to.
play)," Hoke said. "It's not fair to
anybody who is involved to say
when we did this or when we
didn't do this."
MORE REPS: Redshirt
sophomore Drake Johnson was
the first Michigan running back
to rush for more than 100 yards
in a game this season since now-

Michigan football coach Brady Hoke wouldn't say whether running back Drake Johnson will get more carries this week.

injured sophomore Derrick
Green did against Miami (Ohio)
six games ago.
But that doesn't mean he'll see
more snaps this week against
Northwestern. On Monday, Hoke
wasn't ready to say Johnson
would get more snaps, offering
little in the direction he'll go.
"They'll compete like they
always do," he said.
Johnson, a third-string back,
finished with 122 yards and
two touchdowns on 16 carries
in three quarters of action to
lead all backs in the Wolverines'
win over Indiana. Meanwhile,
Michigan's other running backs,
sophomore De'Veon Smith and
redshirt junior Justice Hayes,
combined for 42 yards Saturday
after totaling 66 yards against
Michigan State.
Without Green, who is out for
the season with a broken clavicle,
Michigan hasn't had the same
threatin the ground game.
Hoke and offensive
coordinator Doug Nussmeier
both note Johnson brings
a different running style,
describing him asa "slasher."
"He's got good speed, he's
goingto try and create holes with

his speed, and you'll see him
stick his foot in the ground and
go north and south," Nussmeier
said. "I think he's continuing
to develop his feel within our
running game, understanding
which holes to hit and when."
But Nussmeier was also quick
to cite his improved performance
from "all 11 guys," highlighting
the performance from his
offensive line. But neither the
line nor the wide receivers were
needed to open up holes or block
for extended periods of time,
as Johnson was able to burst
through.
"Drake had an awesome
game," said redshirt junior
center Jack Miller. "He made us
look better at times."
SIGNAL STEALING?:
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison didn't need to talk
much about his defense during
Monday's press conference.
After all, the Wolverines limited
the Hoosiers to 24 pass yards and
contained the nation's leading
rusher.
Instead, he spent time
discussing opponents stealing
signals, which he described as

being "real prevalent" in college
football.
Mattison described coaches
who wait for a play call to be
communicated to the defense
and then communicate that
signal down to the field so the
offense can catch the defense off
guard.
So to make sure no one
was able to steal his signals,
Mattison had two people hold
towels behind him. As Indiana's
effort continued, Mattison had
four people call in signals as a
distraction.
Soundridiculous?Itprobablyis.
"That's what it has become
now," Mattison said. "Bo would
die. He would not like that, I can
tell you that."
WEEKLY JABRILL
UPDATE: For the second
consecutive week, freshman
defensive back Jabrill Peppers
was excluded from the depth
chart.
Peppers, who last appeared in
Michigan'sgame against Utah on
Sept.19, hasn't been ruled out for
the season. He could be in line for
aredshirt, but Hoke isn't budging
on whether he plans to do that.

By JUSTIN STERN
Daily Sports Writer
Moments before former
Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon's resignation, the
Wolverines received their third
commit to the 2016 football
recruiting class. Four-star
linebacker Dele' Harding tweeted
on Friday, "Just committed to the
University of Michigan #GoBlue."
The 6-foot-1, 232-pound junior
from Elkton, Michigan ranks No.
186 overall in the 2016 recruiting
class according to Rivals.com.
For the Wolverines, Harding's
commitment adds confidence to a
program that saw two decommits
in the month of October.
As the Feb. 4 deadline
approaches, here's a rundown of
notable performances.

While he is still committed to
Michigan, Clark has started his
search for other options. He
will visit Southern California
on Nov. 29 and Texas on Dec. 6.
Clark was once committed to
North Carolina and now says he
is considering a potential Nov. 15
visit to Chapel Hill.
Brian Cole, athlete: Saginaw

ESPN (142) Scout (39)
Saginaw Heritage finished
its season with a 2-7 record.
While Cole remains committed
to Michigan, he made an official
visit to Wisconsin. On Oct.11 Cole
told GoBlueWolverinecom, "As
of right now, I'm still committed
to Michigan." With the insecure
job status of Michigan football
coach Brady Hoke, Cole said,

"That's kind of scary, but me and
Coach Hoke have talked a couple
of times, and he said that he
would let me know individually
(if he was going to be let go), so
I've really just not been worrying
about it."
Michael Weber,running back:
CassTech (Mich.)vs. Mott
(Mich.); Ranking: ESPN (169)

Weber has been raising the
eyebrows of recruiters all over
the nation these past few weeks.
Cass Tech won its home playoff
game against Mott, 26-7, behind
Weber's 229 rushing yards and
four touchdowns. In the past
three weeks, Weber has rushed
for 624 yards and 10 touchdowns.
The Technicians look to build
upon the momentum as they face

On Saturday, Malzone led
Brother Rice to a playoff victory
over Cousino, 38-21. Malzone
finished 13-of-25 for 143 yards,
with three passing touchdowns,
one rushing touchdown and
no interceptions. Even with an
undefeated record, Brother Rice
dropped five spots in the state
rankings and is currently ranked
No. 8. The Warriors face Groves
on Saturday in their next home
playoff game.

Five things we learned: Blowout losses in Houghton

Michigan falls to
2-5, off to worst
start since 1986,
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan hockey team
was swept this weekend at
Michigan Tech. After a strong
showing against ranked
opponents Boston University
and UMass-Lowell, the
Wolverines proved there are
holes in nearly every facet of
their game.
Here are five things we can
take away from a disappointing
weekend and start to the season
as Michigan enters a bye week.
1. The forward lines are still
very much in flux.
Prior to Friday's series
opener against Michigan Tech,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
announced 11 lineup changes
in hopes of sparking a dormant
offense.
The coach split up his first
line, separating sophomore
forward JT Compher from
junior forward Andrew Copp.
The duo, two centers by nature,
had been playing side-by-side
all season in hopes that, with
Compher at the wing, last
season's top-two scorers would
create offense for one another.
It was a move that sent
Compher back to his comfort
zone on the second line and
junior center Boo Nieves to left
wing opposite freshman Tony
Calderone. Sophomore forward
Tyler Motte jumped up to the
first line to play alongside Copp
and freshman Dexter Dancs.
In their new positions, the
Wolverines managed only one
goal against Huskies netminder
Jamie Phillips, prompting more
changes Saturday.
After bumping Michigan's
most productive line down
to third on Friday, Berenson
moved the trio of sophomore
Alex Kile, freshman Dylan
Larkin and senior Zach Hyman

on his best behavior because
every one from here on out will
yield a one-game suspension,
per NCAA rules.

non-conference record.
For its troubles, Michigan
currently sits in fifth place in
front of a struggling Wisconsin
team. The Badgers, one of the
youngest teams in the country,
are winless in four contests.
The Wolverines are leading
the league in something -
they've surrendered 27 goals,
10 more than the next-highest
total allowed in the Big Ten.
Projected to finish second in
the conference, Michigan won't
want to lead that category come
March.

to avoid the sweep.

Wolverines' best faceoff men
this season, lost 13 draws

only player to finish above 50

Meanwhile, Compher finished

circle.

Downing, a player who has
created a reputation for hard
hits, showed why he spent a
significant amount of time in
the box last season, earning
matching major penalties on
Friday and Saturday.
