HEARINGS DELAY CSG RESULTS

As of 4 a.m., student
government election
winners yet to be
announced
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
As of 4 a.m, a group of about 20 peo-
ple filled the single-room LSA student
government offices where the fate of
yesterday's highly contested Central
Student Government presidential elec-
tion - receiving the highest voter turn-
out in recent history with 19 percent
- rested in a hearing of the University
Elections Committee to determine the
eligibility of multiple candidates.
No results had been determined as
of 4 a.m., following nearly eight hours
of deliberation on a case filed by LSA
junior Robert Bowen on behalf of
OurMichigan and youMICH against
Business junior Manish Parikh, an

independent candidate for CSG presi-
dent, regarding misuse of an e-mail
listserv for campaigning purposes, a
violation of student government elec-
tion policy. New accusations also arose
early this morning against the Our-
Michigan party for engaging in similar
acts of listserv exploitation, spurring
further investigations by the UEC.
A candidate can be individually dis-
qualified from the election with a total
of five demerits and an entire party
can become ineligible with a total of
10 demerits among party members.
Numerous. members of several campus
political parties continually filed in an
out of the CSG offices on the third floor
of the Michigan Union yesterday for
hearing-related matters until adjourn-
ing to LSA-SG offices when the Union
closed at 2 a.m.
The hearing was still ongoing early
this morning as the UEC continued to
determine if Parikh and his running
mate, LSA sophomore Omar Hashwi,
had warranted enough demerits for
disqualification from the election, and

began further examinations against
OurMichigan.
CSG President DeAndree Watson
said this spectacle was unparalleled.
"I have never seen anything like this
since I have been involved in student
government," Watson said. "I'm con-
cerned with the time it's going to take
to sort through all the complaints that
have been filed and I hope we can get
through this as quickly as possible."
Watson added that these hear-
ings could reflect badly on the people
involved, noting that he believes more
complaints may be filed before the
results are released. The polls officially
closed at midnight yesterday, and offi-
cial results can't be released until the
hearings have been completed.

ByALICIAADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Though President
Barack Obama's efforts to
solve the 2008 economic
crisis were extensively
covered by the media,
author and journalist
Noam Scheiber searched to
find the less widely known
individuals who played an
influential role in advising
the president in his fiscal
decisions.
The Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy held a special
public lecture and book
signing yesterday after-
noon with Scheiber as
part of the school's Distin-
guished Speakers Series.

At the event, Scheiber, a
senior editor for The New
Republic magazine based
in Washington, D.C., dis-
cussed his recently pub-
lished book, "The Escape
Artists: How Obama's
Team Fumbled the Recov-
ery" to an audience com-
prised of Ann Arbor
residents, students and
faculty.
In an interview before
the event, Scheiber saidbhe
decided to write the book
after he realized the enor-
mity of the economic crisis
of September 2008.
"It became clear that it
wasn't going to be a gar-
den-variety recession,"
Scheiber said. "It was
really sort of a deep, pain-
ful thing that had some
dramatic possibilities and
some room for ... critiqu-
ing the way (the financial
team) handled it."

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH REMEMBERING TRAYVON
Drug may cause healthier cells

Researchers synthesize
chemicals to increase
calcium flow to cells
By JOSH QIAN
Daily StaffReporter
University researchers may have
discovered a modern-day fountain of
youth with the recent development of
a potential drug that may aid cellular
recycling and slow the aging process.
The research team - headed by
Haoxing Xu, an assistant professor of
molecular, cellular and developmen-
tal biology, and composed of Andrew
Lieberman, an associate professor
of pathology, and Hollis Showalter, a
medicinal chemistry research profes-
sor - synthesized a collection of chem-

icals that increase calcium flow to cell
lysosomes, which serve as recycling
centers for cellular waste.
"The importance will be similar to
the trash-removal system in our daily
lives that includes trash bins and jani-
tors," Xu said. "Increased cellular-
recycling activities could provide
a treatment for diseased cells with
excessive accumulation in the lyso-
some and/or slow trafficking."
The research is currently funded by
the National Institutes of Health and
the ML4 Foundation - a non-profit
corporation founded by families of
individual affected by the genetic dis-
ease mucolipidosis type IV.
Xu said the research results demon-
strate that the drug has the potential to
treat unique metabolic disorders such
as Niemann-Pick disease and mucolip-

French stand-off ends
with suspect shot in head

Gunman identified
with al-Qaida,
radical Islamists
TOULOUSE, France (AP) -
Inspired by radical Islam and
trained in Afghanistan, the
gunman methodically killed
French schoolchildren, a rabbi
and paratroopers and faced
down hundreds of police for 32
hours. Then he leapt out a win-
dow as he rained down gunfire
and was fatally shot in the head.
France will not be the same
after Mohamed Merah, whose
deeds and death yesterday could
change how authorities track
terrorists, determine whether
French Muslims face new stig-
mas and even influence who
becomes the next French presi-
dent.
The top priority for inves-
tigators now is determining
whether Merah, who claimed
allegiance to al-Qaida, was the
kind of lone-wolf terrorist that
intelligence agencies find par-
ticularly hard to trace, or part
of a network of homegrown
militants operating quietly in
French housing projects, unbe-
knownst to police.
Either way, French authori-
ties are facing difficult ques-
tions after acknowledging that
Merah, a 23-year-old French-
man of Algerian descent, had
been under surveillance for
years and that his travels to
Afghanistan and Pakistan were
known to French intelligence
- yet he wasn't stopped before
he started his killing spree on
March 11. Merah had been on a
U.S. no-fly list since 2010.
"One can ask the question
whether there was a failure or
not," French Foreign Minister
Alain Juppe said on Europe 1
radio. "We need to bring some
clarity to this."
Three Jewish schoolchildren,
a rabbi and three paratroopers
died in France's worst Islamist
terrorist violence since a wave of

attacks in the 1990s by Algerian
extremists.
Merah filmed all three
attacks, Prosecutor Francois
Molins said yesterday, and
claimed to have posted them
online.
"You killed my brother; I kill
you," he said in the video of the
first attack, in which one French
paratrooper died, Molins said.
"Allah Akbar," (God is Great),
he declared during the second,
when two more soldiers were
killed.
Authorities are trying to
determine whether Merah's
29-year-old brother, Abdelkad-
er, was involved, and are search-
ing for accomplices who might
have encouraged Merah to kill
or furnished the means to do so,
Molins said.
Merah espoused a radical
form of Islam and had been
to Afghanistan and the Paki-
stani militant stronghold of
Waziristan, where he claimed
to have received training
from al-Qaida. He also had a
long record of petty crimes in
France for which he served
time in prison, and prosecutors
said he started to radicalize
behind bars.
Police detained his mother
and brother and surrounded
Merah's building soon after 3
a.m. Wednesday. They tried to
detain Merah but were rebuffed
by a volley of gunfire from his
second-floor apartmentinacalm
residential area of Toulouse.
For the next day and a half,
the police, the neighborhood
and the nation waited.
Barricaded inside with no
water, electricity or gas, Merah
at first promised to surrender,
but kept postponing the move.
Finally, he declared he would
not go without a fight, the pros-
ecutor said. Police were deter-
mined to take him alive, and
tried to wait him out.
Near midnight Wednesday,
the detonations began, as police
set off blasts to pressure him to
emerge and blew the shutters

off a window. Through the night
they continued.
Merah stopped talking to
negotiators, Interior Minister
Claude Gueant said, and suspi-
cions surfaced that the gunman
could have committed suicide.
Then around 11:30 a.m., police
commandoes moved in, enter-
ing through the door and win-
dows, Gueant said. Merah was
in the last room they checked:
the bathroom.
He burst through the door fir-
ing a Colt .45, then jumped out
a window "with a weapon in
his hand, continuing to shoot,"
Gueant said.
In the gunfight, he was shot
in thethead, Molins said. Me said
the police acted in self-defense
after some 30 bullets had been
fired.
The SITE Intelligence Group,
which monitors Internet mes-
sages, reported yesterday that
a little-known jihadist group
had claimed responsibility for
the attacks in France. Jund al-
Khilafah issued a statement
saying "Yusuf of France" led an
attack Monday, the day of the
Jewish school shootings, it said.
There was no independent con-
firmation of the claim.
French President Nicolas
Sarkozy, speaking in Paris,
announced tough new mea-
sures to combat terrorism. He
said anyone who regularly visits
websites that "support terror-
ism or call for hate or violence
will be punished by the law."
He also promised a crackdown
on anyone who goes abroad "for
the purposes of indoctrination
in terrorist ideology."
Sarkozy appealed to citizens
not to equate the violent acts of
extremists with France's esti-
mated 5 million Muslims. Mus-
lim leaders urged against any
backlash against believers.
"Our Muslim compatriots
had nothing to do with the
crazy motive of a terrorist," Sar-
kozy said, noting that Muslim
paratroopers were among those
killed.

HAROUNATRCAORE/AP
Civilians walk past burning tires lit in support of mutinying soldiers, in Bamako, Mali Wednesday.
Mutinous soldiers declare
coup, kidnap Mali Pres.

President Toure's
whereabouts still
unknown, soldiers
refuse to disclose
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) -
Drunk soldiers looted Mali's
presidential palace hours after
they declared a coup on yester-
day, suspending the constitution
and dissolving the institutions
of one of the few established
democracies in this troubled
corner of Africa.
The whereabouts of the
country's 63-year-old president
Amadou Toumani Toure, who
was just one month away from
stepping down after a decade in
office, could not be confirmed.
The soldier heading the group
of putschists said on state tele-
vision late yesterday that Toure
is "doing well and is safe." Capt.
Amadou Haya Sanogo refused
to say where the ousted leader
is being kept, and did not make
clear if they are holding him.
The mutineers said they were
overthrowing the government
because of its mishandling of

an ethnic Tuareg insurgency in
the country's north that began
in January. Soldiers sent to fight
the separatists have been killed
in large numbers, often after
being sent to the battlefield with
inadequate arms and food sup-
plies, prompting fierce criticism
of the government.
The coup began Wednesday,
after young recruits mutinied at
a military camp near the capital.
The rioting spread to a garrison
thousands of miles (kilometers)
away in the strategic northern
town of Gao.
At dawn yesterday, some
20 soldiers huddled behind a
table, facing the camera on state
television. They introduced
themselves as the National
Committee for the Reestablish-
ment of Democracy and the Res-
toration of the State, known by
its French acronym, CNRDR.
The soldiers said they intend-
ed to hand over power to an
elected government, though
they made no mention of the fact
that elections were supposed to
be held on April 29. Toure was
not in the race, as he has already
served the maximum two terms.
Criticism of the coup was

swift. France is suspending all
government cooperation with
Mali, except for aid. In Washing-
ton, State Department spokes-
woman Victoria Nuland said
officials were meeting to discuss
whether to cut off the $137 mil-
lion in annual U.S. assistance.
The United Nations Secu-
rity Council issued a statement
denouncing the coup, calling
for the safety and security of
the president, for the troops to
return to their barracks, and for
the restoration of democracy.
"The situation is grave for our
democracy and our republican
institutions," said Ali Nouhoum
Diallo, the former president of
Mali's National Assembly. "We
cannot approve the seizing of
power through force."
The mutinous soldiers
imposed a nationwide curfew.
A flight headed to Bamako was
forced to make a u-turn in the air
after the borders were closed. At
noon, soldiers were still riding
on scooters and in pickup trucks
shooting in the air, and local
media was reporting casualties
from stray bullets.
In recent years, the U.S. mili-
tary has been helping train Mali-

Durbin to fight

The U.S. Senate's second-
ranking Democrat said yesterday
he would fight a Michigan fer-
ryboat company's plan to con-
tinue dumping coal ash into Lake
Michigan while researching a
new method of powering the ves-
sel.
Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois
described as "far-fetched" a pro-
posal by Lake Michigan Carferry
Service to convert the S.S. Badger,
the nation's last working coal-
powered steamship, to liquefied
natural gas. The 410-foot Bad-
ger hauls about 100,000 passen-
gers and 30,000 vehicles a year
between Ludington and Manito-
woc, Wis., operating from mid-
May and mid-October.
It discharges more than 500
tons of waste ash from its coal
boilers during a typical season.
Coal ash contains trace amounts

At least five high-rankingexec-

The departures include three

Afghanistan to
look at every detail
in pact with U.S.
Afghanistan's president said
yesterday that his government
is "taking a magnifying glass" to
proposals for the country's stra-

United States.
In a speech at the graduation
ceremony for Afghanistan's mili-
tary academy, Hamid Karzai also
reiterated a pledge that any deal
reached will respect Afghan sov-
ereignty.
Talks on the pact, which will

set the rules for U.S. troops who
stay on after the majority of com-
bat forces leave in 2014, have
stalled on several occasions in
recent months as Karzai has
demanded more control over how
American forces operate in the
country.
Afghan and U.S. officials both

detail complicated econom-
ics and governmental affairs,
Scheiber said he tried to write it
in a way that most people could
understand.
"I tried to keep it as free of
Washington jargon or econom-
ics jargon as possible," he said. "I
tried to make ... the explanations
pretty intuitive."
Scheiber explained the most
important element of his book
is that it's built around the indi-
vidual characters involved in
the financial decision making
process. Scheiber said he tried
to geta real sense of Obama's key
advisers by interviewing every-
one from their high school class-
mates to current colleagues.
"There's this small group of
people who had a ton of power
and responsibility at the begin-
ning of the administration,"
he said. "The hope of the book
was to try to help you under-
stand why they made the deci-

sions they made and what they
brought to it themselves."
During the lecture, the main
topic of discussion was whether
or not Obama's bipartisan atti-
tude was a strategic move or
political naivety. After the lec-
ture, Scheiber participated in
a question and answer session,
to further discuss the differing
opinions.
Public Policy Prof. John Cior-
ciari said the Ford School invited
Scheiber to speak because his
work deals with contemporary
economic policy and resolving
the economic crisis, popular dis-
cussion topics within the school.
"It seemed like it would both
be a good opportunity to have a
book that's gotten a lot of good
coverage, to have him discuss
that, but also to deal with a topic
that we know interests a lot of
our students and community,"
Ciorciari said.
Ann Arbor resident Bill Tyler
said while he hasn't read the
book yet, he is impressed with
the way Scheiber writes and
expresses his ideas in The New
Republic.

"I read a book review of it in
The New York Times," Tyler
said. "(Scheiber) received a very
good review, and I'm interest-
ed in how he'll summarize the
issues in the book here, and how
he'll present his sources."
LSA freshman Sarah Myint
said while she was glad she
came to the lecture, she didn't
plan to buy Scheiber's book and
was frustrated that the discus-
sion focused largely on party
politics.
"I was really looking for an
unbiased talk," Myint said. "I
still felt there was a bias in favor
of Obama, and I was unflattered
with the bias against the Repub-
licans that I heard."
Though Myint was unim-
pressed, Ciorciari said he'
thought the event went well.
"Even on a day when it's
warm and the weather's beauti-
ful and people have other things
to do, we managed to get some
students, we have some faculty,
we also had a lot of people from
the community who came in,
and that's sort of the purpose of
this," Ciorciari said.

idosis Type IV. Additionally, he
noted that it may be able to treat
neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
Xu noted that his team has
always had a keen interest in
understanding the calcium-flow
process and its effect on the lys-
osome.
"Researchers (compared)
various functions with diseased
and non-diseased control cells,"
Xu said. "We found that calcium
flow, but not other functions, is
reduced specifically in diseased
cells."
Xu said a method known as
calcium imaging led the team to
find and synthesize new chemi-
cals that have the potential to
increase calcium flow to the
lysosome.
"Once we found the chemi-
cals, we tested their effects in
cellular recycling, which is also
commonly known as lysosomal
transport," Xu said.
However, Xu said more

research is necessary before
commercialization of the drug,
including additional experi-
ments and optimizationofchem-
icals for better performance.
"We need at least two years
to conduct these animal experi-
ments, and if these experiments
are successful we will consider
pre-clinical and clinical trials on
human patients," Xu said.
Rackham student Dong-
biao Shen, a graduate student
research assistant in Xu's lab,
said he believes the science
behind the drug is groundbreak-
ing.
"Our work introduced a novel
concept of enhancing cellular-
waste clearance by manipulat-
ing (the protein) TRPML1 with
small molecular drugs," Shen
said. "This work might provide
an alternative strategy to treat
lysosomal storage disorders and
common neurodegenerative dis-
orders."
On March 13, the team pub-
lished their findings in Nature
Communications, a multidis-
ciplinary journal that prints
research in biological, physical
and chemical sciences.

world," he said. "(We have) a tre-
mendous opportunity to improve
in the state of science education."
Following several years of
teaching and mentoring gradu-
ate students, Wieman said he
realized his students did not
emerge as competent physicists
until they had spent at least two
to four years in the lab. He added
that this insight significantly
changed his teaching methodol-
ogy, and he began to center his
classes more on engaging and
motivatingstudents with materi-
al they had studied before class,
rather than transmitting new
information.
"There (was) some fundamen-
tal underlying reason for this,"
he said. "I started approaching
teaching and learning just howI
approached science."
Wieman added that students

need intensive practice to devel-
op an expertise in their subject.
"You have to go do this for
10,000 hours and you get to
world-class expertise and really
a different brain," he said.
He added that this technique
has been confirmed by studies
that show students learn more
effectively when a professor uses
quizzes and interactive lecture
materials in class.
"Traditional lectures (are) not
an effective way to learn," he
said. "We're not being ineffec-
tive in our teaching, we're being
anti-effective."
Wieman cautioned that the
new approach is difficult for
many professors to adapt to
because they often resist change,
and there is little incentive to
restructure lessons because
many universities focus on
research rather than teaching.
Rackham student Mark Rep-
pell said he came to the lecture
because he might be interested

in teaching in the future, add-
ing that interactive classes have
been most helpful in his learning
experiences.
"I feel like when you are
engaged and you have to actu-
ally think during the class peri-
od instead of just writing notes
mindlessly are actually classes
I've learned the most in," he said.
"Incorporating that into classes
is a good idea, especially in math
and science."
Math Prof. Robert Krasny
said he found the lecture inter-
esting, but noted that he already
employs Wieman's recommen-
dations in his own teaching.
"I am encouraged by what he
says and inspired, but I think I'm
already doing it and I just intend
to keep on doing it," he said.
Krasny said small classes and
an incentive for faculty to alter
their teaching styles are "abso-
lutely crucial" in improving sci-
ence and engineering education
at the University.

Obama lauds his energy policy

President
visits site of
potential pipeline
construction
CUSHING, Okla. (AP) -
President Barack Obama firm-
ly defended his record on oil
drilling Thursday, ordering the
government to fast-track an
Oklahoma pipeline while accus-
ing Congress of playing politics
with a larger Canada-to-Gulf
Coast project.
Deep in Republican oil coun-
try, Obama said lawmakers
refused to give his administra-
tion enough time review the con-
troversial 1,170-mile Keystone
XL pipeline in order to ensure
that it wouldn't compromise the
health and safety of people liv-
ing in surrounding areas.
"Unfortunately, Congress
decided they wanted their own
timeline," Obama said. "Not
the company, not the experts,
but members of Congress who
decided this might be a fun
political issue decided to try to
intervene and make it impos-
sible for us to make an informed
decision."
Facing fresh criticism from
Republicans who blame him
for gas prices near $4 a gallon,
Obama announced Thursday
that he was directing federal
agencies to expedite the south-
ern segment of the Keystone
line. The 485-mile line will run
from Cushing, Okla., to refiner-
ies on Texas' Gulf Coast, remov-
ing a critical bottleneck in the
country's oil transportation
system. The directive would
also apply to other pipelines that
alleviate choke points.
"Anyone who says that we're
somehow suppressing domestic
oil production isn't paying atten-
tion," Obama said, speaking at
the site of the new Oklahoma
project.
Republicans said the moves
were little more than a publicity
stunt, arguing that it wouldn't
help Canadian company Trans-
Canada build the pipeline any
sooner. Construction is expect-
ed to begin in June with comple-
tion next year.
"The American people can't

afford more half-measures on
energy from the president," said
Kirsten Kukowski, a Republican
National Committee spokes-
woman. "No matter what he
says, the reality is he killed the
Keystone pipeline and the ener-
gy production and 20,000 jobs
that went with it."
Environmentalists were also
critical of Obama's move. Susan
Casey-Lefkowitz of the Natural
Resources Defense Council said
it was "downright foolhardy to
cut corners on safety reviews
for permitting" the Texas-to-
Oklahomaline, "especially when
the industry has a history of oil
spills."
Obama's order urges speedy
review of the Cushing project
and directs federal agencies to
incorporate previous environ-
mental studies of the Keystone
proposal that included the
southern route.
The use of previous studies
should help move the project
forward more quickly than if
a review of the project start-
ed from scratch, although it's
unclear exactly how much time
the expedited review will save.
Republicans call the presi-
dent's actions a belated attempt
to take credit for a project over
which he has relatively little
control. While federal agencies
such as the Army Corps of Engi-
neers and the Interior Depart-
ment play a role in the approval
process for the domestic por-
tion of the pipeline, states have
a more direct say in approving
the route.
Shawn Howard, a spokes-
man for TransCanada, said the
company welcomed Obama's
support for the Oklahoma-to-
Texas portion of the pipeline
but couldn't say whether his
involvement would impact the
timeline for completing the
project.
The full Keystone pipeline
became a political flashpoint
late last year when congressio-
nal Republicans wrote a provi-
sion forcing Obama to make a
decision and environmental
groups waged a campaign to kill
the project. Obama delayed the
project in January.
Obama has been highlighting
his energy agenda this week in

Nevada, New Mexico, Oklaho-
ma and later Thursday in battle-
ground Ohio, a trip that reflects
the degree to which high gas
prices have begun hitting con-
sumers in their pocketbooks.
For Obama's advisers, rising
gas prices pose a threat to his
re-election bid because they
could undermine the benefits
of a payroll tax cut that he made
the centerpiece of his jobs agen-
da last fall - Congress approved
the tax cut extension in Febru-
ary - and throttle the economic
recovery.
Republicans view rising gas
prices as emblematic of Obama's
energy record and hope to
tag him with the blame even
though no president has much
control over prices at the pump.
Gas prices have risen more than
50 cents a gallon since January
in response to a standoff over
Iran's nuclear program that has
threatened to disrupt Middle
East oil supplies.
GOP presidential hopeful
Rick Santorum, campaigning
at a Harvey, La., company that
services oil rigs, said Obama's
administration should open
more federal lands for leases to
boost U.S. oil production and
revenue for the federal govern-
ment.
"Here's an opportunity for us
in this country to do something
about it: increasing jobs, lower-
ing energy prices, decreasing
the deficit, all of the things you
would think the president of
the United States would be for,"
Santorum said.
Mitt Romney, Santorum's
chief rival for the Republi-
can nomination, has labeled
Obama's top energy advisers
the "gas hike trio," urging the
president to fire three Cabinet
secretaries because of the high
prices.
Obama was ending the day
with a stop in battleground
Ohio, talking about automobile
research and development at
Ohio State University in Colum-
bus. The president has cited his
decision to raise fuel efficiency
standards to 55 miles per gallon
for new vehicles by 2025 as an
important step in conserving oil
and savingconsumers at the gas
pump.

said.
Even when the prelimi-

"I'm really excited for next

rolling with all of our initia-

different student groups on
campus, have already started
brainstorming campus-wide
initiatives to roll out with a lot

Canning said a major focus of
her administration will be con-
necting with students.
"We want to hear their input

"Tomorrow morning I actu-
ally will be working on my

have put student government
aside for the day," Canning said.
"But for the rest the weekend
I'll be fully devoted to choosing
our new executive board."
In addition to the candidates
up for election, students also
voted on a number of ballot

on modernizing changes to

Parikh said that after the
divisive climate generated from
yesterday's election, it's impor-

Efficient justice
Prioritize reducing rape test kit backlogs
There's no way to reverse the physical and psychological trau-
ma of rape. Though the pain can't be undone, rape kit testing
provides an avenue for survivors to seek justice by potential-
ly identifying a perpetrator. Rape kits contain DNA evidence, details
of the examination and costly technology to possibly link a perpetra-
tor to the case. According to estimate by the Department of Justice,
there's a backlog of 180,000, though advocacy groups place the num-
ber significantly higher. The justice system, along with state and local
officials, should further prioritize cases of sexual assault and secure
greater resources to process rape test kits.

As the University builds new
ties with for-profit busi-
ness, who's calling the
shots?
That's the
biggest ques-
tion raised by
the University's
recent start-up
investments and6
corporate "part-
nerships." And,
it's not an easy JOEL
one to answer. BATTERMAN
There's a signifi-
cant difference
between providing office space to
an alumni-run tech company and
collaboration with a multinational
corporation to fund research on
issues that the corporation has a
major stake in. But for now, let's
consider the second case, because
an instructive case study is hot off
the press.
On Mar. 12, University President
Mary Sue Coleman announced a $10
million gift to the University from
the Dow Chemical Company. The
gift will fund a sustainability fel-
lowship program for a total of 300
University graduate students over
a period of six years. This is a big
sum of money for the Graham Envi-
ronmental Sustainability Institute,
whose office currently sits off-cam-
pus over the Starbucks at South State
Street and East Liberty Street. To
date, the Institute has funded only
six fellowships each year. It's not a
large amount for Dow, which posted
profits of $2.3 billion in 2010, but
the company evidently believes it's a
good investment.
To get a sense of Dow's interest
in the program, it's helpful to know
that Dow is one of the world's larg-
est chemical companies - though
its headquarters in sleepy Mid-
land, Mich. belies its global reach.
Dow also has a checkered record
when it comes to sustainability,

at least by most definitions. What
"sustainability" means is wickedly
hard to pin down, but most people
can probably agree that it doesn't
extend to mass poisoning, suffo-
cation and incineration of various
life forms. Unfortunately, a number
of Dow's products over the years,
such as napalm and Agent Orange,
have been designed specifically
for those purposes. Dow also faces
continued challenges over various
production-related mishaps, such
as the contamination of Midland
with cancer-causing dioxin and
the deaths of roughly 3,000 people
in Bhopal, India after a gas leak at
a factory owned by Dow subsidiary
Union Carbide.
There is nothing cynical in sug-
gesting that Dow's investments
in the University's sustainability
programs are related to its historic
challenges in that field. By law, for-
profit corporations exist to gener-
ate profits for shareholders. Indeed,
many would argue that for them to
do anything otherwise would be
a serious disservice. For better or
worse, this is how free enterprise
works, and we should know better
than to assume otherwise. From
the above examples, however, it
seems that a certain degree of cau-
tion from the University might be
necessary in any partnership with
the company in order to advance a
broader public interest.
To return to our opening ques-
tion, we should ensure that the
University is calling the shots with
regard to its own activities. Yet
that's a question we can't answer,
because the agreement between the
University and Dow over the terms
of the $10 million gift isn't public
information. Ann Arbor's Ecology
Center has filed a Freedom of Infor-
mation Act request to disclose the
terms of the transaction.
"Companies have a particular
perspective," says Ecology Cen-
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

ter environmental health director
Tracey Easthope, who has conduct-
ed research and advocacy on Dow-
related issues for 15 years. "And
that's legitimate." (Full disclosure:
I've previously worked as an intern
for the Center, though not on any-
thing to do with Dow.) But Dow's
interests may not match the public
research interests of the Univer-
sity. "Where it's most concerning is
where the company might be able
to have some influence over and
challenge the independence of the
institution," Easthope says. Until
we know the terms of Dow's gift,
we can't know whether or not that's
happening.
Dow's interest
in the 'U' is
for-profit.
And in the end, whatever the spe-
cific language of such agreements,
I wonder if relationships between
universities and large for-profit
corporations can truly be free of
embedded power imbalances. The
ability to act lies with the money,
so it's no surprise that the Univer-
sity and other schools are courting
for-profit industry as government
support declines. If we're serious
about putting the University on an
equal footing with for-profits in any
future dealings, we'll need to do
more than disclose their terms, as
pleasing as that would be to see in a
student government platform. We'll
also need to work on the broader
challenge of returning public fund-
ing to the public university.

Two years ago, the Michigan State Police
collected more than 10,000 untested rape kits
from the Detroit Police Department, accord-
ing to The Associated Press. About 2,000 of
these kits were collected from a closed Michi-
gan crime lab. Only about 1,400 will be pro-
cessed by the end of the year through funding
from the Justice Department's National Insti-
tute for Justice.
Testing rape kits is costly and time-
consuming. Each test can cost from $1,200
to $1,500 and take three to six months for
results to come back from the lab. For cases
in which private companies are contracted
to do the testing, crime labs must verify their
results - sometimes taking another three to
six months. This means that even a test that is
run immediately - which appears to be hap-
pening infrequently - victims may wait up to
a year to receive the results.
DNA testing is performed quickly after
violent crimes like homicide, but less priority
is placed on test kits of sexual assault survi-
vors. This extended time frame means serial
offenders may be able to victimize other
individuals. Besides assisting in identifying
perpetrators, DNA testing can also exoner-

ate wrongly convicted criminals. If testing
doesn't occur within a particular time period
after the assault, cases may be ineligible for
prosecution, silencing survivors' voices with
undelivered justice. After the pain survivors
have gone through, an inefficient justice sys-
tem wrongs these individuals again.
A September 2010 Department of Justice
study estimated that 25 percent of college
women will be victims of sexual assault or
attempted sexual assault before they gradu-
ate. Given these statistics, and the mass num-
ber of rape kit tests on backlog, the data is
disheartening. While more efficient testing
doesn'tguarantee justice for the victim, it cre-
ates an environment where more perpetrators
are held responsible.
Programs and funding for rape kit testing,
such as the National Institute for Justice and
the Michigan State Police's Backlog Reduction,
are increasingin cities like Houston, Los Ange-
les and Detroit. Still, the massive backlogneeds
immediate attention. The process of testing
must be seriously expedited. The state and fed-
eral government need to recognize the signifi-
cance of prioritizing rape kit testing to ensure
justice is secured for the victims.

Transforming transit

A typical student's week
almost undoubtedly con-
sists of some or all of the
following -

If you're between the ages of 18 and 34,
chances are you care about the transit system
in the area you live in. According to a recent
study done bythe U.S. Bureau of Transporta-
tion statistics, 80.5 percent of people in this
age group cite local transit as an important
feature of the community they live in or
would like to live in. Young people want to
live in places where they can easily travel to
their jobs and visit friends and cosmopolitan
areas without having to worry about park-
ing or dealing with traffic congestion. Public
transit offers a cheap and efficient alterna-
tive to the inconveniences that go along with
owning a carin an urban area.
Young people have good reason to be con-
cerned about transit in their area. Transit
systems are important for reasons that go
beyond convenience. Transit projects not
only provide efficientnways to get from place to
place, they also provide significant economic
benefits to the communities they are a part
of. Transit in the United States is currently
funded at $26 billion annually, but according
to the Center for Transportation Excellence,
public transit provides a benefit of $34 billion
annually by stimulating community growth
and reducing expenses caused from traffic
congestion and auto emissions.
On top of the financial benefit, Americans
living in transportation intensive metropoli-
tan areas save $22 billion annually in trans-
portation-related personal expenses, such as
buying gas or car insurance. As the nation-
wide economic recovery continues, more jobs
are being created, and employees need con-
venient ways to commute to work. The CTE
reported that without public transit systems,
10 million Americans would be without their
primary method of transportation in getting
to work.
The social justice benefits of public transit
are also well-documented. According to the
CTE, 93 percent of white households own at
least one car and therefore don't rely on pub-
lic transit to get to and from work. However,
only 83 percent of Hispanic households and
76 percent of African-American households
own at least one car. Those who are less
likely to own a car are more reliant on public
transit for their daily commute. Not having
a viable public transit system has a dispro-
portionately negative effect on minorities
including Hispanics and African Americans,
as their employment is more heavily depen-

dent on access to public transit. On top of
that, according to the CTE, 94 percent of
Americans on welfare attempting to enter
the workforce don't own a car. To get to their
jobs, these Americans would also rely on pub-
lic transit, making public transit essential for
bringing former welfare recipients back into
the workforce.
Most young people know that good tran-
sit systems have environmental benefits, but
many are unaware of the magnitude of these
benefits. As public transit systems are alter-
natives to car ownership, they play a large
role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions
created by the burning of fossil fuels. In fact,
the CTE reported that public transit systems
avoid the emission of 126 million pounds of
hydrocarbons each year. For a generation
that cares greatly about its environmental
impact, public transit offers a sensible, clean-
er alternative to cars.
Americans can also reduce the amount of
gasoline they purchase and consume byusing
public transportation. Public transportation
cuts the amount of gasoline purchased in the
United States by 1.5 billion gallons annually,
mitigating America's dependence on oil and
reducing the amount of hydrocarbons that
are released by burning fossil fuels.
Public transit is an essential aspect of
creating a desirable community to live in.
Expanding public transit systems provides
extraordinary benefits to the people in these
communities. Considering the enormous
economic, social justice and environmental
benefits that viable public transit systems
provide, it's easy to see why young people are
passionate about the transit systems in their
communities.
This weekend the University's chapter of
College Democrats Committee on Environ-
mental Issues, along with TruMich and the
University of Michigan branch of the Roos-
evelt Institute, will be hosting a conference
focusing on transit issues in southeast Michi-
gan. The conference will bring together local
politicians, activists, intellectuals and com-
munity members to discuss the current state
of transit in southeast Michigan, the barriers
to its expansion and the role young people can
play in shaping the future of public transit.

University's chapter of College Democrats.

LEAH
POTKIN

hol are the only
items on the list posing potential
health risks, recently more and
more studies are showing the nega-
tive effects of eating red meat -
which puts a burger in the mix to
harm college students.
It's no surprise that the col-
lege student often leads a less than
healthy lifestyle, but the downfalls
associated typically come in the
form of foamy alcoholic beverages
or other mind-altering substitutes,
and not in the form of succulent
steaks. But a recent study released
by the Harvard University School of
Public Health shows that red meat
consumption is associated with
a higher risk of early death, and
should be eaten in moderation - or
not at all. Considering consumption
of red meat also leads to imbalances
in the body's pH levels, students
should consider their carnivorous
habits in order to balance their
lives and bodies, and should at least
understand the risks associated
with eating red meat before sinking
their teeth into their next steak din-
ner or fast food burger.
Looking more into the conse-
quences of eating red meat, the
study found that regular consump-
tion of red meat is associated with
certain cancers, type-2 diabetes,

coronary heart disease and stroke,
with increased risks associatedwith
consumption of processed meats.
To combat these risks, the study
suggests replacing fatty red meats
with healthier protein sources such
as fish, poultry, nuts or legumes.
Most notably, the study found that
an estimated "9.3 percent of deaths
in men and 7.6 percent in women
could have been prevented at the
end of the follow-up if all the par-
ticipants had consumed less than
0.5 servings per day of red meat" -
that's one Bar Louie dollar burger-
less Tuesday.
Despite college students' busy
schedules limiting their food choic-
es, it's vital that they realize how
what they put into their bodies
now will help or hurt them in the
future. Though it might be easy for
students to order red meat at a vari-
ety of cheap and fast food campus
restaurants, making minor dietary
adjustments such as ordering a veg-
gie slice instead of a sausage slice at
NYPD, or subbing chicken for beef
in a BTB burrito, would be benefi-
cial for health in the long run. The
same goes for making healthier
choices in the dining halls, where, if
students know where to look, there
are actually many alternatives to
the potentially harmful (though
delicious) bacon and burgers. Not to
mention, the lower fat alternatives
to red meat typically come with the
added bonus of lower costs - always
a plus for the tightly budgeted col-
lege student.
While it is, of course, essential
that students take into account
the physical repercussions asso-
ciated with regularly eating red
meat, there are also negative envi-
ronmental impacts. On a campus as
eco-aware as Michigan's, it seems
almost oxymoronic that many stu-

dents promote sustainability, but
don't even give a second thoughtto
their weekly visit to Blimpie Burger.
So, if red meat isn't already looking a
bit less appetizing, students should
remember the negative environ-
mental impacts, such as increased
waste production and pollution,
that go hand-in-hand with the pro-
cessing of red meat.
Studies show the
health risks of
red meat.
Ultimately, it's a student's own
decision whether he or she decides
to eat red meat, but it's vital any
decisions are educated ones, as not
everyone thinks about how their
dietary choices in college could
affect them later in life. And even
looking beyond the beef, the idea
of acknowledging potential health
consequences is something that
should be considered in correlation
with sleep habits, drinking habits,
and the like, as it is the compilation
of choices such as these that, while
unbeknownst to them now, could
greatly and adversely impact stu-
dent's lives in the future. So, while
I don't expect everyone to change
their favorite McDonald's order
or run to the farmer's market, I do
hope that students will think twice
before ordering the beer and the
burger.

RC to explore abuse

Hilarity served in season

To tell the story, Stroud uses
a less conventional format, that
blends elements of the real and
the surreal. Its format uses a
minimalistic set and heavy dia-

of Amanda Cohen are tight, cohe-
sive and enriching to the play
experience, Stroud explained.
"Some of my biggest inspira-
tions would be Tony Kushner
and Allen Ball, because they both

create something more true than
a realist set," Stoud said. "It lets

As the audience comes to
understand the characters, so too
the characters begin to under-
stand each other in relation to
August Guilt. It is about admit-
ting abuse and moving beyond it,
Stroud explained, and only once
they move beyond Guilt - both as
a character and a representation
for their shame - do they heal.
"It's a powerful play of ret-
ribution and reconciliation, of
abuse's damage and the hope of
recovery," Stroud said. "And at
its core, it is an experience and
experiment that brings the audi-
ence together with the actors to
question some of the most impor-
tant facets of public and private
relationships."

I have a confession to make:
In a moment of extreme bore-
dom over spring break, I will-
ingly chose to purchase and
watch "Breaking Dawn: Part 1."
I sat there for the entire 117 min-
utes, unable to tear my eyes away
from the awful spectacle that is
the second to last movie in the
"Twilight" saga. Why, you ask?
It's simple: curiosity.

Hollywood has been cranking
out franchise films for as long as
I can remember, typically based
on comic books or action figures.
But why the giant shift to fran-

novels? Well, everybody knows
that the youth run the world.
It's a genius idea really, one that
has been used time and again
by everyone in the entertain-
ment industry. Kids, teens and
newfound adults bring in the big
bucks. Since Hollywood realized
that animated children's flicks
and series like "Harry Potter"
are some of the highest gross-

nonstop to get their hands on the
next big phenomenon.

from the title, it's clear that
there is something a little sin-

The show kicks off its first
half with the fourth movement
from Shostakovich's 5th Sym-

under the pressures of Stalin's
Russia and the constraints of
Social Realism, crafted his 5th
Symphony as an outlet for the
strife, triumph and confusion of
his era. The fourth movement
itself is a blend of marching

Robinson developing into leader

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Denard Robinson is learning
to not smile.
Four days into the Michigan
football team's spring prac-
tice, the junior quarterback has
emerged as a distinct leader of
the offense. Robinson has been
a Heisman Trophy candidate, a
record-setting quarterback and
Big Ten Offensive Player of the
Year.
But Robinson's never had to
take the reins as the unques-
tioned leader of Michigan. After
three years, he's ready for that to
change.
"I wasn't an outspoken per-
son," Robinson admitted on
Thursday. "I didn't do a lot of
telling people (what to do) or
patting them on the butt, so
that's what I need to start doing
and that's what I'm taking on
this spring."
But being a leader also means
being the bad guy.
"Oh yeah, sometimes you've
got to get up in (their faces),"
Robinson said. "Help them out,
give them encouragement. You
can't always be nice to them. I
can't always have a smile on my
face."
Is that even possible? Robin-
son smiled.
"Oh it's possible, it's possible,"
he said, laughing.
It's a work in progress.
Redshirt junior wide receiv-
er Roy Roundtree has already
noticed a difference in Robin-
son's demeanor. The timing is
better. The reads are better.
And the play calls in the hud-
dle are as clear as day.
"I used to tell (Robinson) that
he's so country that you can
barely hear him," Roundtree
joked.
Robinson said he has taken
freshman quarterback Russell
Bellomy under his wing, giving
instructions on timing, patience
and accuracy in the pocket.
The thought of the electric
Robinson's upcoming senior
season as Michigan's starting
quarterback is thrilling. But so
is the thought of him passing on
his lessons to underclassmen.

MARISSA MCCLAI N/Daily
Junior quarterback Denard Robinson is taking a larger leadership role for Michigan after an in-the-spotlight offseason in Ann Arbor.

"It is exciting to me," said
offensive coordinator Al Borges.
"It's exciting to all of us."
Ever since Robinson and the
Wolverines returned from a
Sugar Bowl victory in early Jan-
uary, Robinson hasn't been able
to keep himself out of the head-
lines or off TV screens.
But the soft-spoken leader
hasn't regretted one bit of the
press.
As if Robinson hadn't already
been the face of the Michigan
football program, he was singled
out by President Barack Obama
during a speech at Al Glick Field
House in January.
"Where's Denard?" Obama
asked. "I hear Denard Robin-
son's in the house."

"I'd go to all of them if I had a
chance," Robinson said.
Still, Robinson doesn't think
the off-season in the spotlight
has changed him. He's learning
not to smile, but it's nothing dif-
ferent.
"No, because I enjoy interact-
ing with people," Robinson said.
"That's one of the things that
I've always enjoyed. I come from

Michigan
water polo
primer
By BOB McWILLIAMS
For theDaily
Every weekday morning, a
cheery group of student-athletes
gathers in Canham Natatorium
to play the strangest sport. The
result of basketball meeting
soccer and jumping into a pool,
water polo mixes familiar ele-
ments into a sport that can seem
very foreign to outsiders.
Though most water polo
matches take place in regulation-
size pools, the No. 10 Michigan
water polo team recently played
in a pool that was definitely not
normal.
"It had a shallow end," said
Michigan coach Matt Anderson.
"We're a team that likes to spread
things out, but since Hartwick
was the home team, they picked
a pool that would negate that."
Sportsmanlike or not, coaches
are allowed to do this in water
polo.
Unlike more popular sports,
where huge high-school tal-
ent pools force athletes to spe-
cialize to stand out, water polo
players have to be a complete
package. Players have to be fast
swimmers, able to throw bullets,
strong enough to fend off con-
tact, quick at decision-making
and tall enough to throw over
outstretched arms to have a
chance of playing at Michigan.
And that's the thing: Michi-
gan is really good at water polo.
In his 10-year tenure, Anderson's
team has never failed to win its
division. The Wolverines have
won five conference titles, quali-
fied for the national tournament
three times and created a rare
water polo powerhouse 2,000
miles from the Pacific Ocean in
a sport historically dominated by
California schools.
This year's edition is no dife-
rent. There's junior attacker Kiki
Golden, an honorable mention
All-American junior who had
39 goals in 37 games last year. A
trio of experienced goalkeepers *
is led by junior Alex Adamson,
who ranks fourth in saves in
Michigan's history. The center
- a key position, also called the
two-meter because that's how
far away from the goal she camps
out = is junior Lauren Colton, a
commanding player who set a
school record for drawing seven
opposing player ejections in a
single game.
The list could go on. Four
other Wolverines have won divi-
sional awards this year. Eleven
different players scored against
Gannon two weeks ago. The
team has been thrashing local
competition and going toe-to-toe
with the best in the country.
Anderson pins his success on
having an established program.
The continuity of coaching style
allows his upperclassmen to
know what to expect.
"Katie (Card, the assistant

coach) and I, we only have two
sets of eyes hetween us, and
we're removed from the pool,"
Anderson said. "We can't stop
things and get into the pool for
any hands-on training. So we
rely on the seniors to bring along
the freshmen because they've
seen everythingbefore."
There's also volunteer coach
Jeff Kacerek too, who isn't afraid
to jump into the pool if an extra
body is needed. But hidden in
Anderson's words is the rev-
elation that the coaching staff is
remarkably small. Much of their
time must be spent on "house-
keeping" tasks such as putting
up nets and timing laps.
"There's a lot of schlepping we
have to do," Anderson said.
It's bizarre that a program
with such a national pedigree
would have so few caretakers,
especially when other collegiate
sports often have a sizable fol-
lowing of trainers and managers.
Even with the backdrop of cham-
pionship banners hanging from
the rafters and plaques of Michi-
gan legends posted on the walls,
there's something that feels
very laid-back and approachable
about Michigan water polo.
Anderson, as always, has an
answer.
"We're a working-man's
coaching staff," he said.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Junior forward Chris Brown was moved off the first line to a heavy-checking, big-bodied line this week.
Berenson shuffles lines in
preparation for Cornell

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
GREEN BAY, Wisc. - For the
first time in months, senior for-
ward Luke Glendening could take
a deep breath. A sigh of relief.
But only for a second - it's win
or go home time
now.
For the 22nd Cornell vs.
year in a row, Michigan
the Michigan Matchup:
hockey team Cornell 18-8-
earned a bid 4; Michigan
in the NCAA 24-12-4
Tournament. When: Fri-
And in the end, day, 9 P.M.
it didn't have
much to sweat Wher: Resch
- the Wolver-
ines earned TV/Radio:
a one-seed in ESPNU
the Midwest
region, setting up a matchup with
four-seed Cornell on Friday night.
But for a while, that streak was
in serious jeopardy. On Thursday,
Glendening revealed for the first
time how much that gnawed at
him,
"You talk about the legacy
of Michigan hockey a lot, and I
didn't want to be part of the legacy
that was the first to not make it,"
Glendening said.
It was senior defenseman Greg
Pateryn, actually, who spoke first.
He indicated that the team didn't
feel too much pressure, that the
team was confident it would
rebound after a dreadful Novem-
ber. But Glendening deviated from
his teammate's response. For him,
he said, it was personal.
The Resch Center, where
Michigan will play Cornell on
Friday, sits right in the shadow of
Lambeau Field. So when college
hockey's most consistent dynasty
drove past the home of one of the
NFL's most consistent dynasties
and arrived at the arena, Glenden-

ing could be content.
But not for long.
"It's not good enough for us
just to be here," Glendening said.
"That's not what we came to do.
It's not satisfying just showing up.
You come to play hockey."
And so to protect the team
from complacency, Michigan
coach Red Berenson is making
some somewhat substantial line
changes.
Well, maybe. During the week,
junior forward Chris Brown, who
usually plays on a potent scoring
line with senior forward David
Wohlberg and freshman forward
Alex Guptill, was elsewhere.
Instead, sophomore Derek DeB-
lois replaced him.
But Berenson isn't positive that
he's making changes.
"When you see the line chart
(on Friday) you'll have a better
idea," Berenson said. "But I like
the fact that we've got some flex-
ibility. We've had different players
play with different players during
the year, and we've even had some
guys play different positions. I
think when you get to this point of
the year, you have to be flexible, as
a coach and a player.
"That doesn't answer (the)
question, but that's my answer."
SO to counter Michigan's
hinted-at-but-maybe-not-you'll-
just-have-to-wait-and-see line
changes, Cornell plans on... well,
actually, Cornell doesn't really
care.
"We pride ourselves on great
balance," said Cornell coach Mike
Schafer. "Defensively, I'm never
really worried about anybody on
our team and line matchups ...
(so) you know that if you play a
team that's going to create a one-
two punch and two players, or
you're playing against a team that
can contribute offensively from
everywhere that we have that bal-
ance.

"We don't feel that there's a line
that we have to protect or defen-
sive pair that we have to protect."
Cornell, after all, has per-
formed well defensively no mat-
ter who it has played. The Big Red
allow just 2.27 goals per game,
good for 12th in the nation, and
got tougher against tough oppo-
nents. They surrendered just
two goals to Boston University
when the teams played at Madi-
son Square Garden in a game that
went into overtime. And they sur-
rendered just four total goals in
two games against Colorado Col-
lege. Because of its tough defen-
sive style, Berenson feels a sense
of familiarity with Cornell.
"I see them as a CCHA-type
team," Berenson said. "If they
were in our league, they'd be right
there with the top teams in our
league. They're in the ECAC, but
they look like they belong in the
CCHA."
And if this one is close, look for
penalties to play a deciding role.
Michigan has been anemic on the
power play this year with a 15.3
percent conversion rate, but Cor-
nell's penalty kill (78.9 percent) is
even worse. Michigan will need
to capitalize on those opportuni-
ties if it is to advance to the sec-
ond round against the winner of
the Ferris State-Denver contest.
Berenson's team was all busi-
ness on Thursday. While the first
three teams to take the ice blared
songs by Kelly Clarkson and Gym
Class Heroes, the Wolverines
practiced in silence.
Maybe that's because Beren-
son, who's seen his share of
NCAA Tournament games, sees
this do-or-die game as a nail-
biter.
"Whether it's their grinding
style or the defensive style, I just
see this as a real grinding, hard-
fought, close game," he said.
Deep breath's over.

avigatingthe Michigan
locker room last week
in the minutes after the
Wolverines fell victim to Ohio's
upset bid was a dreary chore.
Players sat
solemnly at
their lockers.
The room
was cloaked
in a shocked
silence, and
reporters
obliged the
atmosphere BEN
by practically ESTES
whispering
their ques-
tions to the few who seemed
worthy of an interview.
Mst of the attention was
given to seniors Zack Novak and
Stu Douglass, whose careers
had just ended in near tragic
fashion. They were asked mostly
ahout how they could look past
this immediate disappointment,
whether they could reflect on all
they had managed to accomplish
at Michigan.
But while the pair of captains
spoke about their pasts, the
queries for the next generation
of team leaders were focused on
their futures: would Trey Burke
and Tim Hardaway Jr. be return-
ing for their sophomore and
junior years, respectively?
Really, it was a silly time
to be asking that question of
them. The two had just finished
playing a heartbreaker, having
allowed an underdog to end their
season well before they imag-
ined it would. Even if Burke and
Hardaway Jr. had thought about
their futures before that night,
the only thing that possibly
could have been in their head at
that moment was how painful
that loss was.
But because we, the media,
know we won't have regimented
access to the team again until
next fall, we're forced to ask
about the NBA right then, 15
minutes after the season had
ended.
I asked Hardaway Jr. first if
he had thought about his future
plans at all.
"I'm staying," he said. "I'm
staying."
"You're staying for sure?" I
replied.
"For sure," Hardaway Jr. said.
And that was that: unadul-
terated confirmation from the
source himself that Tim Hard-
away Jr. would be wearing the
maize and blue as a junior.
At about the same time, Burke
also told reporters he'd be com-
ing back. That would end the
speculation and controversy
already - no reason to be follow-
ing this story for the next few
weeks.
But here's the problem: NBA
draft decisions made in the wake

Freshman guard Trey Burke is testing the NBA draft waters this month.

of season-ending losses - or
even made in front of the media
in general - mean nothing.
Burke proved as much this
week, when his father Benji
told several media outlets that
the family was looking into his
draft status, and that they would
decide whether Trey would stay
in school or leap to the NBA once
they came back with solid infor-
mation about where he might be
picked.
Whether Burke ends up
staying or going, the informa-
tion-gathering step in itself is
evidence enough that there's
no point in taking any stock of
unreliable public draft resolu-
tions.
It's hard to fault Burke for
looking at his options. Most play-
ers grow up dreaming not of col-
lege basketball, but the pros, and
Burke is doubtless no exception.
Considering that college success
and NBA draft standing are so
fleeting - in almost all cases, a
player's stock goes down after
an additional year in college - it
makes sense to leave as soon as
you know you'll be a first-round-
er, meaning you're guaranteed a
contract.
And though some maybe mad
at the apparent hypocrisy of
telling the media you're staying,,
only to then explore the possibil-
ity of leaving, you can't blame
any player for ever doing so.
Just what good would come
out of telling the truth? It would
immediately bring a firestorm of
unwanted attention, making the
whole process even more stress-
ful for someone like Burke.
Despite the high-minded
air they may hold themselves
in, fans don't really care about
honesty.
If Burke said after the loss
to Ohio that he was consider-
ing the NBA and then went out

and actually declared, Michigan
supporters wouldn't say, "Well,
at least he was honest about it."
They would be just as angry as
they would if he declares now
after saying he was staying - the
focus would be on his actual
decision, not what he said in an
emotional moment after a loss.
There's just no benefit for
Burke or anyone else to be forth-
coming about it in such a situ-
ation. Fans will be angry if he
leaves either way, and no points
for honesty will be given.
So while Hardaway Jr. was
pretty emphatic in declaring his
intentions to stay, I'm goingto go
ahead and ignore what he said.
Even if he and Burke end up
returning, there are too many
examples of players who have
claimed they're coming back
only to change their stance a
short time later. Look no further
than star Kentucky freshman
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who
told reporters a few weeks ago
he would come back for his
sophomore season. ESPN's Chad
Ford reported on Wednesday
that Kidd-Gilchrist was instead
headed to the NBA.
Do I think Burke and Hard-
away Jr. will leave? No, though
I'm much more confident Hard-
away Jr. stays, justbecause his
struggles this season essentially
mandate that. But we'll know
one way or the other on March
29, the deadline to declare for
the NBA draft. And the picture
clears up even more on April 10,
the deadline to pull out of the
draft ifa player has declared.
The only thing we know for
sure? The declarations of March
16 will continue to mean nothing.
Estes would like to announce
that he's coming back for his
senior year. He can be reached

New staff boosts morale

Blue opens vs. JPFW

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
After a 20-game road trip, the
Michigan baseball team finally
gets to enjoy the comforts of Ray
Fisher Stadium for the first time
this season.
For the third time in four sea-
sons, Michigan (9-11 overall)
opens up its home schedule with
a three-game series against Indi-
ana-Purdue Fort Wayne.
In 2009 and 2010, the Wolver-
ines opened up with sweeps of
IPFW, but if they hope to repeat
their performances, they will
need their bats to awaken.
"I don't think it's a concern, but
I think it's something we need to
improve on quickly," said junior
centerfielder Patrick Biondi.
Since starting the season red-
hot, the lineup has cooled off con-
siderably and it's reflected in the
team's record. En route to win-
ning six of their first 10 games,
the Wolverines averaged 7.3 runs
a game. But in their last 10 games,
they have just won three.
According to Maloney, the
Wolverines haven't given them-
selves enough opportunities to
score runs.
"You've got to score runs,"
Maloney said. "Some of that is by
working yourself to earn more
freebies. We've got to strike out

less so that we'll get more oppor-
tunities. Teams will make errors,
but you've got to put the ball in
play."
Sophomore right fielder
Michael O'Neill and freshman
left fielder Will Drake, the team's
two best hitters, have especially
slumped recently. Two weeks ago,
O'Neill was riding a 10-game hit-
ting streak and was second in the
Big Ten with a .480 batting aver-
age. Eight games later, O'Neill is
now hitting just .363. Over the
same period, Drake has seen his
batting average plummet from
.372 to .329.
But O'Neill and Drake aren't
the root of Michigan's anemic
offense. Biondi, senior third base-
man John Lorenz, senior catcher
Coley Crank and freshman short-
stop Dylan Delany - all key com-
ponents to the offense - are all
hitting lower than .243. As a team,
the Wolverines' batting average
has plunged over the past few
weeks and currently sits at .251.
If Sunday's victory against
Connecticut was any indication,
Michigan could break out of its
slump this weekend against the
Mastodons (4-14).
The Wolverines knocked
Husky starter Jared Dettman
out after just three innings. They
scored just two runs on Dettman,
but their patience at the plate

forced him to throw 73 pitches
and walk four batters. They took
advantage of a weak bullpen to
score five more runs against Con-
necticut's relievers.
IPFW will most likely pro-
vide plenty of opportunities for
the offense to find a rhythm.
None of the Mastodons' three
expected starters this weekend
- Jason Kalber, Travis Reboulet,
Charles Weaver - have an ERA
under four, and only Kalber has
recorded a win. Though the Wol-
verines don't have any starting
pitchers that average a strikeout
per inning, they have plenty of
firepower on the mound. Junior
right-hander Ben Ballantine is
undefeated with a1.87 ERA, while
allowing opposing offenses to hit
just .209 against him. Redshirt
junior left-hander Bobby Brosna-
han has recorded two wins and
has a 2.54 ERA. They should have
little trouble against IPFW's line-
up. Not one hitter with more than
14 at-bats is hitting above .300.
Senior right-hander Brandon Sin-
nery, who has struggled of late,
will look to record his first win
when he starts on Saturday.
The Wolverines are eager to
play their first games at home.
Maloney, though, just hopes
Michigan can put aside its excite-
ment and just play mistake-free
baseball.

flying colors. Then, after working
with the New York Mets, Arizona
Diamondbacks and the Major

he returned to Michigan for his
"junior year."
"Hopefully, they'll let me
graduate," Merriman said with a
laugh.
Freshmen start to get comfort-
able in the environment and toss
aside old habits on the mound.
It's the year of reformation and
adjustment. Sophomores learn
how to manage innings and con-
trol damage, and no longer have
to think about the fundamentals.
The string of starting pitch-
ers - senior Brandon Sinnery,
redshirt junior Bobby Brosnahan
and junior Ben Ballantine -- had
completed the first two cycles and
were ready to move forward in
their development when Merri-
man arrived.
They had simple deliveries and
solid mechanics, but they lacked
in confidence. Both coaches have
been consistently working with
the team to build up its self-assur-
ance - something that may be
hard to do with a losing record.
But Welton reminds them,
"Baseball is such a game of chal-
lenge. Good hitters fail seven out
of 10 times."

From Page 8
Roberts hung
told the six tea
with the news,
and then set ou
tain and senior
senior goaltend
Sharples to the
senior honor so

g up the phone. He
ammates he lived
made a few calls,
t with fellow cap-
r Mike Moes and
er Warren "Scott"
ir Michiguama (a
ciety) meeting.

Sharples had been anxiously
awaiting this call. He had been
playing some of the best hockey
of his career by 1990, and the
only question left in his mind was
about which team the Wolverines
would play in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. The goalten-
der was a late addition to Beren-
son's second recruiting class after
another recruit decommitted.
Still, Sharples earned the job his
firstyear, and byhis senior season,
he become the first in a long string
of four-year goaltenders that
spanned all the way until when Al
Montoya left early in 2005.
But three years before he got
that phone call, Sharples was cry-
ing during a practice late in his
freshman year. Despite winning
the starting job, Sharples went
12-16 between the pipes in his
freshman campaign and allowed
more than five goals per game.
And he couldn't do anything about
it.
"(It) was the hardest season I
ever had in my life," Sharples said.
"There were some people there
when we got there that didn't have
that hatred for losing that the rest
of us did."
And so at practice one day,
Sharples broke down.
"I just could not will theteamto
win like I had been able to at dif-
ferent levels," Sharples said. "And
I remember a couple of seniors
looking at me, incredulous. I knew
they were looking at me (and)
thinking, 'Why are you letting it
bother you this much?'
"(Losing) didn't bother the guys
that were there."
But, as more Berenson recruits
came in, Michigan started win-
ning. Sharples and his teammates
went 14-25-1 in his freshman year
in 1986-87. The following season,
Berenson's team won more games
than it lost for the first time since
he arrived. InSharples'junioryear
- the first team filled completely
with Berenson recruits - the team
finished sevengames over.500.
From the outset of the 1989-90
season, the team set its sights on
one goal: Makingthe NCAA Tour-
nament. By the time the phone
rang, after the tears had stopped,
after the paint on the helmet had
S dried, and even after the weight-
room renovations were com-
pleted, the team was right on the
precipice.
Sharples didn'tget to the receiv-
er first. He remembers Moes, the
other captain, answering, though
Moes doesn't remember getting
the call at home. Sharples and fel-
low senior Rob Brown leaned in
to listen. After the season, Brown
would get so emotional at the
senior banquet that he would need
several attempts to get through a
tearful goodbye speech. But right
now, he was silent, waiting.

margin of nine goals.
Berenson's penchant for start-
ing freshmen in the first half ofthe
season, before they had matured,
did not help. In 1989, freshmen Pat
Neaton and David Harlock each
went minus-seven in their first
game at Munn Ice Arena.
"I remember getting a call at
the dorm from an assistant coach
(after that game) telling us not to
jump," Neaton said.
The players dreaded when
Michigan State came to Yost. At
that time, the arena would fill up
about halfway for home games.
Except when the Spartans came
to town.
"It was 4,000 Spartan fans and
4,000 Wolverine fans," Roberts
recalled. "And you'd have the 'Go
Green, Go White' chant going on
louder than any Michigan things."
But at Joe Louis on Dec. 30,
something happened: Michigan
won, and won convincingly, 5-3 -
and even that was only after two
late goals by the Spartans.
"That sent them a message,"
Neaton said. "We kicked the crap

began screaming at Harlock and
Neaton, who was also recruited by
Anzalone.
"You guys are nothing!"
The Wolverines finished with
nothing against the Lakers that
year - winless in four tries - but
they beat up on the rest of the con-
ference. By the time the CCHA
playoffs came around, Michigan
was hot, and it easily dispatched
first-round foe Western Michigan
in a two-game sweep. Roberts
recorded the only hat trick in his
career that series.
For most of the 1989-90 sea-
son, though, a talented sopho-
more class had carried the team's
offensive production. Three of
those sophomores lived together,
including Denny Felsner (who led
the team with 27 goals) and Ted
Kramer (who was tied for second
with David Roberts, with 21). But
Don Stone, a junior, picked up
the ringing phone, as Felsner and
Kramer listened in.

ed a bid. The seniors - Mike Moes
and Al Sharples and Rob Brown -
expected a bid. And their leader,
Al Roberts, expected one too.
Berenson hung up the phone.
The committee had gone with
Bowling Green.
Michigan did not make it.
The news traveled through the
phone wires like a wildfire.
When the blaze reached the
seniors, Moes felt it like a punch
to the gut. Sharples said his heart
broke. Al Roberts was shocked,
more than anything. At the Mich-
iguama meeting high up in the
tower of the Michigan Union, Al
Roberts and Sharples and Moes
demanded justice. They demand-
ed a reason. They demanded -
anything. Any chance to put on
the sweater one more time.
Rob Brown locked himself in
his room and didn't talk to any-
body.
And so the seniors searched
for some explanation that could'
ease the pain. The popular theory
is that Bowling Green's Athletic
Director, who served on the four-
man selection committee, swayed
the other three members.
"(He) clearly homered them,"
said John U. Bacon, a Michigan
hockey historian and author of
"Blue Ice." "It was an inside job, it
was grossly unfair, and Michigan
paid the price."
Of course, Schneider,the Sports
Information Director, points out
that Michigan simply didn't win
enough games against Michigan
State, Lake Superior State and
Bowling Green to get themselves
off the bubble. But then there's
this curiosity: Schneider, curious
as to whether Michigan would get
the bid, secretly listened in on the
committee's conference call. The
board opened the lines to ques-
tions from the media.
The second question, accord-
ing to Schneider, from a reporter
for the Los Angeles Times: "Why
Bowling Green over Michigan?"
Rick Comley, the coach of
Northern Michigan and a mem-
ber of the committee, answered.
"It was Michigan's non-confer-
ence situation," he said.
"And I'm sitting there not able
to talk, and I'm thinking - see,
I don't remember if we were the
only team in the country, at least
in the league, to not lose a non-
conference game," Schneider said.

"We had swept Boston University,
and they were a seeded team."
"I feel devastated," Berenson
told The Michigan Daily. "I just
think we were shafted."
Harlock felt miserable too -
not for himself, but for those who
didn't have a next year.
"(They) don't get the credit
they deserve for turning around
the program," he said. "They were
the ones who probably did a lot
more of the behind-the-scenes
dirty work."
In Kramer's house, someone
said, "We're going to have a great
team next year. Just remember
what this feels like."
"I am convinced, out of the
pain of that experience, the seeds
for their 20 years of success were
sown," Bacon said. "They made a
commitment that from now on,
we were never going to leave it up
to some committee of guys we've
never met."
And they didn't. The follow-
ing year, they won 10 more games
than in 1990 and cruised into the
NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1977.
In the first series, the team
so familiar with agonizing exits
lost to Cornell in overtime in the
opening game. In the locker room
after the game, Bacon said, the
team made a pledge: "We're not
going to let this happen again."
"The sense of intensity, of
importance, of determination
(from 1990) was carried forward
to the next team that (came back
and) beat Cornell.
"And now the modern template
for Michigan hockey has been
established."
Sparked by the snub in 1990
and with the credibility from the
1991 tournament run to grab top
recruits, Berenson brought the
team to the verge of the National
Championship game in 1991 and
1992. Each time, those seniors too
suffered a painful ending to their
careers.
For Harlock and Neaton and
Tamer, their ending would come
at the hands of Maine in the 1992
Final Four in a crushing overtime
loss. The freshmen on that team
would be seniors in 1996.
And they would remember.
Now fast forward.
Six years after the call that
ended his career and sparked the
modern Michigan hockey dynas-

ty, Al Roberts gathered with some
former teammates and Michi-
gan hockey alumni at a bar in the
shadow of Wrigley Field in Chi-
cago. For six straight years, the
Wolverines had made the NCAA
Tournament, and for the first five
years, their season ended with a
loss.
In that bar in Wrigleyville in
1996, Al Roberts and the rest of
the crew watched as those Michi-
gan seniors, who lost in overtime
to Maine, entered yet another
overtime.
This time, it was against Colo-
rado College, and this time, it
wasn't for a spot in the National
Championship game.
It was the National Champion-
ship game.
Three minutes and 35 seconds
later, a junior named Brendan
Morrison clinched Berenson's
first National Championship with
a game-winning goal.
Then, in what Bacon called a
clear reference to that 1990 team
- to the Roberts and to Sharples
and to Moes and Harlock and
Tamer - Morrison uttered his
now-famous impromptu speech.
"This is for all the guys that
never had a chance to win it," he
said.
Guys like David Harlock, who
heard the news of Michigan's vic-
tory during an intermission in a
game with a Washington Captials
affiliate and then played the best
third period of his life.
Guys like Mike Moes, who still
to this day finds himself wonder-
ing how in the world Morrison
had the composure and wisdom
to think of guys like him minutes
after one of the best moments in
his life.
And for guys like Al Roberts,
who watched, transfixed, in that
bar in Wrigleyville.
He listened to the speech,
hanging on every word. He felt a
chill run down his spine, a lump
form in his throat, and then the
tears came.
The man who had sacrificed
championships with Michigan
State to come to Michigan looked
up and saw the rest of his former
teammates and friends.
They were bawling too - a
bunch of grown men sobbing into
their suds over a hockey game
played by kids.
And 22 years after the phone
call that sparked it all, Michigan
hasn't yet missed an NCAA Tour-

Wolverines host Penn State to open Big Ten softball season

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
After finishing nonconference
play with a bang by defeating
Eastern Michigan, 10-2, in five
innings, the Michigan softball
team is ready for the Big Ten sea-
son..
The 20th-ranked Wolverines
open conference play with three
games against Penn State this
weekend at Alumni Field.
The Nittany Lions are already
a familiar opponent this season
- the two teams faced off on Feb.

12 at the Tiger Classic in Baton
Rouge, La. Michigan (18-9 over-
all) dominated, winning 12-1 in
five innings to wrap up the tour-
nament title.
After the matchup with the
Wolverines, Penn State (7-15)
proceeded to drop four of its next
five games and is currently suf-
fering through a six-game losing
streak, the latest being a 9-0 loss
to Rutgers on March 11.
Lack of offensive production
has plagued the Nittany Lions
this season - they average 1.7
runs in their losses and barely a

run better in wins, while hitting
.243 as a team. Only one player
hits over .300.
Junior shortstop Alyssa Ren-
wick is the lone leader on offense,
batting .349 while the rest of the
lineup puts up sub-par numbers.
Though Penn State's offense
may be lacking, it does have a
standout in the circle.
Senior pitcher Lisa Akamine
returns to the lead role after an
impressive 2011 campaign. She
was selected Second Team All-
Big Ten with a 135 strikeouts and
a career-low 1.89 ERA. This year,

her numbers are significantly
worse, but Akamine has the con-
fidence and experience to lead the
team through a tough conference
schedule.,
History is on Michigan's side
in the matchup between these
two teams, though. The Wolver-
ines have dominated the series,
winning the last nine games - a
majority coming in shortened
play - and boasting an overall
47-7 record against the Nittany
Lions.
While Penn State is struggling
to find offensive consistency,

Michigan is finally warming up
after a preseason that may not
have been up to Wolverine stan-
dards.
Freshman catcher Lauren
Sweet and senior first baseman
Amanda Chidester lead Michi-
gan's offense with .296 and .289
batting averages, respectively,
and Chidester leads the team in
RBIs with 23.
And the freshman pitching duo
of Haylie Wagner and Sara Dri-
esenga have surprised with their
performances.
Wagner is 12-4 in the circle

with a 1.26 ERA and Driesenga
had quality starts against then-
No.22 LSU and then-No. 17 Lou-
isiana-Lafayette.
Despite a sub-par preseason,
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
is confident in her team's ability
to win a 15th Big Ten title.
"We play a very competitive
preseason schedule so we are
ready to compete with anybody,"
Hutchins said.
"The key word is compete....
If we want to have a chance to be
a Big Ten champion, we have to
compete and battle."
