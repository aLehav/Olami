Courant: Project
not providing full
texts online
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily StaffReporter
The University and
HathiTrust Digital Library, of
which the University is a found-
ing partner, are facing a lawsuit
over alleged copyright infringe-

ment.
The lawsuit was filed Monday
by the Authors Guild, Austra-
lian Society of Authors, Quebec
Writers Union and eight indi-
vidual authors. The organiza-
tions and individuals claim the
University was not authorized
to obtain scans of more than
7 million copyrighted books,
some of which the University
planned to make available to the
public to download. The law-
suit also names the University

of Wisconsin, the University
of California, Indiana Univer-
sity and Cornell University as.
defendants.
According to Paul Courant,
the University's dean of librar-
ies, the digitization project does
not actually allow students to
access the full text of books
online.
"We are using those copies
for purposes other than dis-
playing them to the readers,"
Courant said. "The ones that

are copyright are generally not
available to read."
He added that people with'
disabilities prevent them from
accessing physical libraries will
be able to use the full versions
of the online books. But for the
general public, the books are
only partly available online.
Students and faculty can search
any book online to find perti-

National rate at 8.8
percent, 'U' rate
0.9 percent
ByANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
A large number of University
students and alumni paid back
their loans on time in the 2009
fiscal year compared to many of
their peers at other institutions.
More than 320,000 college
students and graduates nation-
wide defaulted on their federal
student loans in the 2009 fiscal
year, which drove the national
default rate to 8.8 percent -
the highest since 1997. But only
49 of these students attend or
graduated from the University
of Michigan, according to U.S.

Department of Educationdata.
Stephen DesJardins, direc-
tor of the University's Center for
Higher and Postsecondary Edu-
cation, said the number equates
to a default rate at the Univer-
sity of 0.9 percent. Thelow rate
is evidence of the success of
the University's graduatess na .
the breadth of the University's
financialaid offerings, even as
tuition rises and the state's econ-
omy struggles, DesJardins said.
"That (number) doesn't sur-
prise me because this is a high-
quality education that people get
at the University, and I think our
students have lots of success in
the labor market," DesJardins
said. "Those two things go hand
in hand - success in the labor
market and people paying back
their loans."

The sound of a birdie - for-
mally known as a shuttlecock
- bouncing back and forth
between two racquets isn't
unfamiliar to students who
grew up playing badminton
with family or friends. But for
the Badminton Club, it is more
than just a backyard game.
Rackham student Stephen
Raiman, founder of the Bad-
minton Club, said he started
the group as part of an effort
"to foster intercollegiate com-
petition and to have fun."
The Badminton Club recent-
ly started competing with
other university teams, like
Michigan State University and

DETROIT
101-year-old
woman evicted in
Detroit foreclosure
A 101-year-old woman was
evicted from the southwest
Detroit home where she lived
for nearly six decades after her
65-year-old son failed to pay the
mortgage.
Texana Hollis was evicted
Monday and her belongings were
placed outside the home. Her son,
Warren Hollis, said he didn't pay
the bill for several years and dis-
regarded eviction notices.
"I kept it from her because I
didn't want to worry her," War-
ren Hollis told WXYZ-TV for a
report that aired Monday night.
"I was just so sure it wasn't going
to happen."
Wayne County Chief Deputy
Treasurer David Szymanski told
The Associated Press yester-
day that the Hollises took out an
adjustable-rate mortgage in 2002.
A default and foreclosure notice
was filed in November.
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
4,000 inmates
may be granted
early release
More than 4,000 female
inmates in California could
qualify to serve the rest of their
sentences at home, as state offi-
cials begin complying with a law
designed to keep children from
following their parents into a life
of crime.
The alternative custody pro-
gram is for less serious offenders.
Qualifying inmates must have
less than two years left on their
sentences, which would be com-
pleted while they are tracked by
GPS-linked ankle bracelets and
report to a parole officer.
It comes as the state grapples
with court rulings that call for
reducing the prison population
at its 33 adult prisons by more
than 30,000 inmates before July
2013.

The Occupational Safety and
Health Administration , yester-
day announced it had cited Bos-
tik Inc. for what it alleged were
50 violations of workplace safety
standards at its plant in Middle-
ton.
Officials say a valve was acci-
dentally left open in March,
causing acetone vapors to fill

the building and ignite. The four
injured workers are back on the
job.
HAVANA, Cuba
Former N.M. Gov.
attempts to free
American from jail
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson said yesterday thathe
would leave Cuba after exhaust-
ing all possible avenues to try to
win the release of a jailed U.S.
government subcontractor, add-
ing that he was treated so poorly
he doubted he could ever come
back to the island as a friend.
Richardson, who previously
vowed to remain in Cuba until
he at least got to see jailed Mary-
land native Alan Gross, changed
his mind after meetings with the
Cuban government and other
influential groups failed to yield
any results. He said he would
leave today.
"I have been here a week and
tried through all means - with
religious institutions, diplomats
from other countries, all kinds of
efforts - and I see that this isn't
going to change," Richardson
told reporters. "So why would I
stay?"

Ex-media executive
Bob Turner
defeats Democrat
assemblyman
NEW YORK (AP) - Republi-
cans have scored an upset victo-
ry in a House race that became a
referendum on President Barack
Obama's economic policies.
Retired media executive
and political novice Bob Turn-
er defeated Democratic state
Assemblyman David Weprin in a
special election yesterday to suc-
ceed Rep. Anthony Weiner, a sev-
en-term Democrat who resigned
in June after a sexting scandal.
With more than 80 percent
of precincts reporting late last
night, Turner had 54 percent of
the vote to Weprin's 46 percent
in unofficial results.
"We've been asked by the peo-
ple of this district to send a mes-
sage to Washington," Turner told
supporters after the landmark
win. "I hope they hear it loud
and clear. We've been told this is
a referendum. Mr. President, we
are on the wrong track. We have
had it with an irresponsible fis-
cal policy which endangers the

entire economy."
Weprin did not immediately
concede.
The heavily Democratic
district, which spans parts of
Queens and Brooklyr, had never
sent a Republican to the House.
But frustration with the contin-
ued weak national economy gave
Republicans the edge.
Turner has vowed to bring
business practicality to Wash-
ington and push back on spend-
ing and taxes.
The race was supposed to
be an easy win for Democrats,
who have a 3-1 ratio registration
advantage in the district.
Weprin, a 56-year-old Ortho-
dox Jew and member of a promi-
nent Queens political family,
seemed a good fit for the largely
white, working-class district,
which is nearly 40 percent Jew-
ish.
But voter frustration with
Obama put Weprin in the unlike-
ly spot of playing defense. A
Siena Poll released Friday found
just 43 percent of likely voters
approved of the president's job
performance, while 54 percent
said they disapproved. Among
independents, just 29 percent
said they approved of Obama's
iob performance.

Taliban claims
responsibility for
attacks on Afghan
capital buildings
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Teams of insurgents firing
rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic weapons struck at the
U.S. Embassy, NATO headquar-
ters and other buildings in the
heart of the Afghan capital yes-
terday, raising fresh doubts about
the Afghans' ability to secure
their nation as U.S. and other for-
eign troops begin to withdraw.
Seven Afghans were killed and
15 wounded in the coordinated
daylight attack, which sent for-
eigners dashing for cover and ter-
rified the city from midday well
into the night as U.S. helicopters
buzzed overhead. No embassy or
NATO staff members were hurt.
Late Monday, at least two gun-
men remained holed up on the

top floors of an apartment build-
ing from which they and other
militants had attacked the heav-
ily fortified embassy.
The militants' seeming abil-
ity to strike at will in the most
heavily defended part of Kabul
suggested that they may have
had help from rogue elements in
the Afghan security forces. The
attacks also coincided with sui-
cide bombidgs elsewhere in the
capital - the first time insurgents
have organized such a complex
assault against multiple targets in
separate parts of the city.
The Taliban claimed respon-
sibility for the attack, though
Kabul's deputy police chief said
he thought an affiliated organiza-
tion, the Haqqani network, car-
ried it out.
The Taliban and related
groups have staged more than a
dozen assaults in Kabul this year,
including three major attacks
since June. That represents an
increase from years past and is
clearly intended to offset U.S.

claims of weakening the insur-
gents on southern battlefields and
through hundreds of night raids
by special forces targeting their
commanders.
The Obama administration
declared that it wouldn't allow
Tuesday's attack to deter the
American mission in Afghani-
stan, warning the attackers that
they would be relentlessly pur-
sued.
Even so, the U.S. Embassy in
Kabul canceled all trips in and
out of Afghanistan for its diplo-
mats, and suspended all travel
within Afghanistan.
High blast walls ring the
embassy compound, and there
was little damage to the rein-
forced concrete buildings, many
of which are surrounded by sand-
bags.
White House press secretary
Jay Carney said the U.S. would
continue to move toward remov-
ing soldiers sent in as part of the

Washington teacher strikes
persist despite order to return

After failed
negotiations, 87
percent of teachers
vote to walk out
TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -
Thousands of students in Wash-
ington state's third-largest
school district will be spending a
second day out of class as school
officials seek a court order to
force hundreds ofstrikingrteach-
ers back to work.
A Superior Court hearing has
been scheduled at 9 a.m. today
on the Tacoma School District's
request for an injunction to
order nearly 1,900 teachers back
to work. The district's lawyers
contend that public employees
cannot legally strike under state
law. Tacoma.Education Associa-
tion spokesman Rich Wood said
union lawyers will be ready with
a response.
The district has canceled

today's classes for Tacoma's
28,000 students. In Washington
state, only the Seattle and Spo-
kane school districts are larger.
Teachers hit the picket lines
yesterday .after voting over-
whelmingly Monday night to
strike over issues that include
teacher pay, class size and the
way the district's teachers are
transferred and reassigned.
Tacoma teachers had been work-
ing without a contract since
school started Sept. 1.
Both the Washington attorney
general and state judges have
ruled that state public employees
do not have the right to strike.
The News Tribune newspa-
per reported that the walkout
is the first public school teach-
ers strike in Tacoma in 33 years,
since 1978.
District lawyer Shannon
McMinimee said school officials
hoped for a decision from the
judge today.
"The district is doing every-
thing it can to get its staff back

to work," McMinimee told the
newspaper outside court yes-
terday afternoon. The teachers
"are engaging in an illegal strike.
From what I understand, the
teaching union has refused to
negotiate since Saturday. Letting
that go on longer is not going to
do anyone any good."
Union spokesman Wood
called the district's move to
court "extremely disappoint-
ing."
"We think it's a shame the
Tacoma Public Schools admin-
istration and the Tacoma School
Board would rather drag their
teachers to court than negotiate
a fair contract settlement," he
said, adding, "Tacoma teachers
care about their students, and
they will decide when to end this
strike."
Eighty-seven percent of the
Tacoma Education Association's
total membership voted to walk
out, after weekend contract
negotiations failed to result in
an agreement.

Complaint made
at International
Criminal Court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - Clergy sex abuse vic-
tims upset that no high-ranking
Roman Catholic leaders have
been prosecuted for sheltering
guilty priests have turned to the
International Criminal Court,
seeking an investigation of the
pope and top Vatican cardi-
nals for possible crimes against
humanity. The Vatican called
the move a "ludicrous publicity
stunt."

nonprofit legal group, request-
ed the inquiry yesterday on
behalf of the US.-based Survi-
vors Network of those Abused
by Priests, arguing that the
global church has maintained
a "long-standing and perva-
sive system of sexual violence"
despite promises to swiftly oust
predators.
The Vatican's U.S. lawyer,
Jeffrey Lena, called the com-
plaint a "ludicrous publicity
stunt and a misuse of interna-
tional judicial processes" in a
statement to The Associated
Press.
The complaint names Pope
Benedict XVI, partly in his
former role as leader of the
Vatican's Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, which
in 2001 explicitly gained
responsibility for overseeing
abuse cases; Cardinal William
Levada, who now leads that
office; Cardinal Angelo Sodano,
the Vatican secretary of state
under Pope John Paul II; and
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who
now holds that post.
Attorneys for the victims
say rape, sexual violence and
torture are considered a crime
against humanity as described
in the international treaty that

spells out the court's mandate.
The complaint also accusVati,
can officials of creating policies
that perpetuated the damage,
constituting an attack against 8
civilian population.
Barbara Blaine, president of
the Survivors Network, said
going to the court was a last
resort.
"We have tried everything
we could think of to get them
to stop and they won't," she told
The Associated Press. "If the
pope wanted to, he could take
dramatic action at any time that
would help protect children
today and in the future, and he
refuses to take the action."
The odds against the court
opening an investigation are
enormous. The prosecutor has
received nearly 9,000 indepen-
dent proposals for inquiries
since 2002, when the court was
created as the world's only per-
manent war crimes tribunal,
and has never opened a formal
investigation based solely on
such a request.
Instead, prosecutor Luis
Moreno-Ocampo has investi-
gated crimes such as genocide,
murder, rape and conscripting
child soldiers in conflicts from
Darfur to this year's violence
in Libya. Such cases have been
referred to the court by the
countries where the atrocities
were perpetrated or by the U.N.
Security Council.
Also, the Holy See is not
a member state of the court,
meaning prosecutors have no
automatic jurisdiction there,
although the complaint cov-
ers alleged abuse in countries
around the world, many of
which do recognize the court's
jurisdiction.
"Politically, people do not
want to look at this," said Cen-
ter for Constitutional Rights
attorney Pam Spees before
walking to the court with vic-
tims to hand prosecutors boxes
full of documents.

An eco-friendly ban
MSA's bottled water resolution shows promise
T he Michigan Student Assembly recently made another
effort to rid bottled water sales from campus. A
 resolution, passed last week proposes Michigan to stop
the sale of bottled water in University convenience stores, the
Michigan League, the Michigan Union and Pierpont Commons,
in addition to snack vendors at various campus events.



Stepping up to stereotypes

The petition, which is currently seeking
student support, has the potential to bring
positive change to campus. The University
sold nearly 600,000 bottles of water in 2009,
and according to the Graham Environmental
Sustainability Institute's Campus Sustainabil-
ity Integrated Assessment, the bottled water
ban could prevent the emission of more than
80 tons of carbon dioxide and 40,000 gallons
of water waste. The environmental benefits of
the ban are clear, and the action by the Univer-
sity would likely inspire other institutions to
follow suit, further reducing the environmen-
tal impact of bottled water.
Aside from being wasteful and energy inef-
ficient, bottled water is an expensive alterna-
tive to tap water. In some cases, bottled water
is less clean than available tap water. Addition-
ally, the use of reusable water bottles is better
for the environment and would also benefit
students financially.
In spite of the clear advantages of the plan,
there are several factors that impede the suc-
cessful implementation of the proposal. The
most significant problem is the issue of clean
refill stations for reusable water bottles. For
reusable water bottles to be easily refilled
throughout campus, more drinking fountain
attachments need to be installed. Currently,
these attachments onlyexist on a few drinking
fountains in University facilities and would
not meet the demand that would exist in the
absence of bottled water.

There's also the concern that students and
others on campus will turn to less healthy
and unsustainable options to replace bottled
water, such as bottled sodas and fruit juices.
To make the ban successful the University
would need to ensure that clean water was
equally available at events without selling
bottled water. University officials would also
need to market the ban in a way that encour-
ages students to make the easy, healthy choice
of reusable water bottles and tap water.
While a ban on bottled water sales in Uni-
versity Housing and campus buildings where
classes are held is feasible, banning it from all
University events could have negative con-
sequences. It's unrealistic to expect every-
one who attends special events on campus,
for example sporting events and concerts, to
bring their own reusable water bottles. Since
bottles are not currently permitted in the Big
House for football games, there needs to be an
alternative for people seeking drinking water.
Continuing the sale of bottled water at special
events would be an appropriate exception to
the otherwise campus wide ban.
It's commendable that University offi-
cials and MSA are working toward making
the campus a more sustainable environment
with a smaller carbon footprint. The bottled
water ban, if properly implemented, has the
potential to further these efforts and estab-
lish the University as a leader in eco-friendly
practices.

As a social psychology stu-
dent at the University, I've
dedicated myself to learn-
ing a lot about
race and class in
the United States
and how to com-
bat the stereo-
types that shape
our society. But
I had a chance
this May, thanks NORA
to grants from STEPHENS
the University,
to put my ivory
tower learning to the test when I
became a one-woman, 20-some-
thing ambassador for the U.S. to a
group of international volunteers in
South Africa. I went there to teach
kids in the Nomzamo Township,
but it turned out I had alot to teach
my fellow English, Irish, Canadian,
Swedish and Australian volunteers
and myself.
"Oh you're American?" theysaid in
a tone laden with assumptions when
I opened my mouth for the first time.
Previous travels with my family had
prepared me for the reactions people
have toward Americans abroad but
since I was alone on this journey,
this was the first time I had ever felt
solely responsible for representing
an entire nation. I took less food in
an attempt to not seem greedy, spoke
quieter in an attempt to not seem
boisterous and spelled words the
British way in an attempt to notseem
uneducated. I was sofocused on try-
ing to prove that my country was not
all bad that I lostsight of who I was. I
had become the token American, and
it was when I came to this realization
that I began to connect the theories
I'm learning in college with actual

practice outintheworld. I turned my
discomfort into dialogue.
For example, while on dinner
duty with a fellow volunteer from
Southern England, I asked her what
she thought of America. She said she
thought most of it was great but that
all the Southern people are dumb. I
pushed her to consider what would
make a whole group of people seem
unintelligent and what she actually
knew about those states south of the
Mason Dixon.
With another British volunteer,
we jokingly asked one of our South
African students, "Who do you like
better - the U.S. or England?" The
child promptly responded, "USA!
England messed up our country."
This led to a powerful discussion
about what the student knew about
history and the inherited guilt the
British volunteer felt about that his-
tory even though he obviously had
nothing to do with the colonization
of South Africa.
These and many other experi-
ences taught me in a way books and
lectures couldn't about how stereo-
types work both ways when we let
ourselves take the easy road and buy
into them rather than do the hard
work of finding out who we really
are. These ideas of stereotypes are
not necessarily new to me. As a
facilitator and research assistant
with the Program on Intergroup
Relations I have thoroughly delved
into how my social identities.affect
my life, ald I find myself constantly
scrutinizing the role social identi-
ties play in our society and on our
campus.
What was different about this
experience was the particular
social identity that was brought to

my attention: my nationality. I real-
ized I had spent thoroughly less
time thinking about my nationality
as a social identity. I felt like I was
caught between being the evil, war-
obsessed American to my fellow
volunteers and the perfect, noth-
ing-is-ever-wrong-with-my-nation
American to the South Africans.
I tried to prove
America was
not all bad.
This experience was a reminder
that until we step out of our com-
fort zones and talk with people who
are different than us, we are unable
to understand who we and others
really are. How can we as Univer-
sity students*learn about nationality
when most of us are American citi-
zens? I challenge us, myself includ-
ed, to make more of an effort to get
to know and talk with students from
other countries. Talk about the ste-
reotypes that face us abroad and
the stereotypes that face University
students who are not originally from
the U.S.
The volunteer from England who
thought all Southern people were
dumb recently wrote on my Face-
book wall that she had stopped ste-
reotyping the South. I'm not sure if
her comments would ever have hurt
my fellow Americans, but her Face-
book post is still a small victory over
ignorance.

We need Ohio State

When the new Wolverines step onto this
glorious campus in Ann Arbor, one thing is
always deep inside their minds: They hate
Ohio State. They want to see Ohio State bleed.
When OSU coach Jim Tressel was fired, Mich-
igan fans across the world rejoiced. The vest
was gone - Michigan will win again!
This deep-seated hatred, although well-
founded, obscures a greater point - Michigan
needs Ohio State, just as much as Ohio State
needs Michigan.
Coming from Toledo, I've seen both sides of
the rivalry. That game defined not only what
team you rooted for but who you were. To this
day, the most divisive and passionately talked
about game is that epic No. 1 v. No. 2 2006
matchup. We all know what happened, but
it still was one of the high points of the past
decade. Why? Because it's OSU.
As Wolverines, we compare ourselves to
the Buckeyes, not only athletically but also
academically. We take pride in being a better
academic institution than Ohio State - being
more reputable, more widely known, higher
ranked by every single system imaginable.
Why? Because it's OSU.
When Tattoogate broke, we laughed and
jeered. Why? Because it's OSU.
When Rich Rod left, we were happy not
only because he destroyed the program but
because he could not beat the Buckeyes. Why?
Because it's OSU.
When Tressel quit, we were happier,
because he went 9-1 against us. Why? Because
it's OSU.
Everything we do always comes back to
none other than OSU.
We have great rivalries with other schools
such as Michigan State, Notre Dame and a new
one coming with Nebraska. Yet we will never
care for those games this year as we will for
Nov. 26, despite that thrilling win over Notre
Dame under the lights. Why? That's when
OSU comes up to the Big House.
A win over OSU would mean so much more
to usthan sneakingpast Notre Dame with two
seconds left.
OSU is a mess. Current OSU coach Luke
Fickell is no Woody Hayes, but we aren't
much better. Sure, we finally got our Michigan
Man in Michigan coach Brady Hoke. When
was our last bowl win? Bowl Championship
series?Ourtlast Big10 championship? National
championship? National championship game?

When was our last win over OSU?
None of this would hurt as much if OSU
hadn't been so damn successful lately.
Michigan's last bowl win: 2008. OSU wins
since then: 2.
Michigan's last BCS Bowl: 2007. OSU since
then: 5.
Michigan's last Big10 Championship: 2004.
OSU since then: 6.
Michigan's last National Championship/
National Championship game: 1997. OSU since
then: 3 games, 1 win.
Michigan's last win over Ohio State: 2003.
OSU since then: 7.
Our football program is the one that is in
shambles, not the Buckeyes'. We shouldn't be
gloating over how much the pride of the Big
Ten has fallen over the past months. In fact,
we should be, in a way, ashamed.
OSU has been the poster team of the Big
Ten for the past decade. It has been easily the
most successful team over that time period.
We need them to stay strong. By doingso, OSU
shows that the Big Ten is not a weak confer-
ence.
The reason why the Southeastern Confer-
ence can stay so consistently powerful lately is
because the conference seems to be the stron-
gest conference, attracting the best recruits.
Meanwhile, the older, plodding Big Ten can't
even beat mid-major Texas Christian Univer-
sity. How do you think that helps our image?
I understand why people were so happy
that OSU made such a mess of itself. It was
probably the happiest moment of my summer.
We shouldn't hope that their football program
becomes worse than Minnesota's though. We
need OSU to stay strong, to show that the Big
Ten is not a weak conference, so that we can
get those players that we need to succeed.
I believe in Brady Hoke. I believe inthe Uni-
versity of Michigan football team. But I also
believe that we need to defeat a strong OSU
team this year, notcjust any team.
After being down so long, will anybody
believe the legitimacy of our win over this
team if OSU does awfully the whole season?
No, it'll be called a product of circumstances.
What if we lose this year? Our program will
be set back even further.
- We need Ohio State to stay undefeated this
year. That'll make Nov.26 all the more sweeter.

ing like you wouldn't believe, fluffy
lake-effect snow and droughts that
occur about as often as a Congres-
sional compromise are just the tip of
the iceberg. The sweltering summer
months have reinforced one thing:
Michigan may not have a booming
economybut damnit, we havewater.
Our counterpart? Texas. They
have some of the fastest grow-
ing cities in the United States, and
according to a May 5 Forbes article,
the best job markets in the country.
Comparing the state of Michigan to
Texas on an economic level is like
comparing the coaching resumes of
Rich Rod and Bo Schembechler -
it's not even close.
In spite of a booming economy,
Texas is faced with one of the worst
droughts on record. Since January,
Texas has recorded a record-low
six inches of rain. How these two
events can coincide is somewhat
of an anomaly when looking at the
history of mankind. Throughout
time, droughts have driven man to
adapt and evolve. When lush ter-
rain turned arid and barren des-
erts, nomads were forced to pick up
and move shop, or shrivel and die.
Though we're a .far cry from our

hunting and gathering ancestors, at
some point we need to evaluate the
logistics of having so much of our
population in an area that doesn't
provide the necessities for life.
Looking at the climatic history
of the Southwest will certainly
not ease any of our fears. During
the past couple thousand years,
droughts have spanned decades.
The dustbowl of the 1930s and the
droughts of the 1950s are not even
the worst examples of dry times in
the South. The devastation that a
10-year drought would have on our
country will force us to look at our
infrastructure and see where it can
be improved.
Stopping 7 billion gallons of
water from being wasted through
leaking pipes each year might be
a start. But with a budget deficit in
the trillions, the money to fix the
leaky pipes might be hard to find.
As a civil engineer, it pains me to say
that fixing our infrastructure may
not be the immediate answer to our
prayers. Perhaps fixing our attitudes
is the remedy we need to avoid a
catastrophe.
The attitude of Americans is one
of the driving forces behind the
South's current predicament. We
have always been the type to throw
caution to the wind when it comes
down to the location of our popula-
tion. There are native tribes defend-
ing their terrain in the Great Plains?
Well, we've got Winchester rifles for
that. That city is being built below
sea level in hurricane ally? Nothing
a couple levies can't fix.
Each example has proven to be
costly and dangerous, and that same
haphazard train of thought can be
applied to the population growth
in the South. Though we eventually
conquered the whole of our country
- and have somewhat rebuilt New
Orleans - the countless lives that

were shattered or ended by our stub-
bornness should have taught us a les-
son. But then again, this is America,
and we can't let a couple bad experi-
ences bring us down. Though history
can often predict outcomes before
we have a chance to second guess it -
just ask Hitler if he thought invading
Russia would turn out the same as
Napoleon's attempt - some lessons
must be learned first hand.
I'm not predicting an apocalyp-
tic ending for Texas - we have the
Mayans for that - but I am say-
ing we need to seriously reevaluate
where our population to expand to
in the future. If we continue to try
to squeeze water from a rock - pun
intended - we might find ourselves
in a situation that cannot be fixed
without serious detriments done to

Only recently has water not been
considered the deciding factor for
where a population decides to settle.
I propose that we go back to think-

settle where available resources
- namely water - are plentiful. A
place like, say, Michigan has these

Fall TV schedule
would be lost
without big names
By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media Editor
If you can't judge a book by
its cover, you certainly shouldn't
judge a TV show by its stars. Yet
with the fall season upon us, I
find myself guiltier than ever of
this crime.
The worst part is that I was
utterly oblivious to my trans-
gressions until this past week-
end. I was doing some important
work - catching up on my
Entertainment Weekly - when
I learned that Nestor Carbonell,
who played the enigmatic and
ageless Richard Alpert on
"Lost," would be acting opposite
Sarah Michelle Gellar ("Buffy
the Vampire Slayer") on The
CW's "Ringer."
My previous interest in "Ring-
er": zero. But with the promise of
looking into Richard's naturally
lined eyes and shadowed face on
a weekly basis again, I was sud-
denly planning my Tuesday night

around "Ringer." Never mind
that Gellar herself is the show's
main draw because of her estab-
lished TV career.
It's not the first time this sea-
son that the key attraction of
a show is the star. I know I'm
hardly alone in planning to watch
"Person of Interest" just because
of Michael Emerson ("Lost") or
check out "Hawaii Five-0" last
season because of Daniel Dae Kim
(also "Lost"). Hell, I just decided
to start watching that show now
because I saw pictures of Terry
O'Quinn ("Lost" - will I ever
stop missing it?) and Masi Oka
("Heroes") on set. And would "Up
All Night" seem remotely promis-
ing without Will Arnett ("Arrest-
ed Development") or Maya
Rudolph ("Saturday Night Live")?
Suffice it to say this could
become a very dangerous habit.
In. the movie world, banking on
star power alone can lead to out-
right heartbreak. (I do apologize
if you, like me, spent money on not
one but two painful Ryan Reyn-
olds movies, "Green Lantern" and
"The Change-Up,".this summer.
We have no one to blame but our-
selves) In recent years, TV shows
like "Glee" and "Community"

that star ensembles of relative
unknowns have gained every-
thing from phenomenal success
to cult and critical adoration. TV
success has made some actors the
draw they are today - see "Parks
& Recreation" 's Aziz Ansari in
"30 Minutes or Less."
So why will I insist on watch-
ing "Ringer?" Why is it so hard
to care about "Revenge" (other
than the fact that it looks dumb)?
For the same reason you'd rather
hang out with your friends than
with a bunch of strangers who
just happen to be around. With
the media, as with real life, there
is undeniable comfort in the sight
of a familiar face.
But, as with real life, we also
have to step out of our comfort
zones now and again. So I'll con-
tinue watching crappy Alex Pet-
tyfer movies, but I'll also watch
"Pan Am" on ABC. Good friends
like Tina Fey will introduce me
to new ones like Jack McBrayer.
And as presumptuous as it is, I
will probably keep checking out
shows and films because of the
names carrying them, so long as
I promise to occasionally venture
into unknown territory. Besides,
all friends start out as strangers.

innocence it makes even the most

LOAN
From Page 1A
In the fiscal year 2008, the
default rate of University stu-
dents was t.4, and in 2007 it was
1.2 percent, according to data
from the National Student Loan
Data System for Students.
The rates announced in a U.S.
Department of Education press
release issued Monday repre-
sent a cohort of borrowers whose
first loan repayment was due

between Oct. 1, 2008 and Sept.
30, 2009 and who defaulted on
their payments before Sept. 30,
2010. Between the 2008-2009
and 2009-2010 academic years,
the University's Board of Regents
raised tuition 5.6 percent but
committed $118 million to finan-
cial aid initiatives for undergrad-
uates.
The highest loan default rates
typically occur in states with
high unemployment rates such
as Indiana and Michigan, which
ranked as the top states with

default rates at for-profit institu-
tions, according to DesJardins.
But he said the qualifications
of many University graduates,
together with the generous finan-
cial aid program offered by the
University the past several years,
have kept default rates at the Uni-
versity low.
"Because people like to hire
folks from Michigan, those peo-
ple who have loans are likely to
pay them back," he said.
The University's default rate
was slightly less than some of

its peer institutions, such as the
University of California-Berkeley
and the University of Virginia.
Michigan State University's rate
rose slightly - to 3 percent from
1.7 percent in the 2008 fiscal year
- but the rates for universities
in Michigan and the state's rates
stayed far below national aver-
ages, as DesJardins and Michael
Boulus, executive director of the
Presidents Council, State Univer-
sities of Michigan, expected.
"I would hope that the default
rate would be lower - I mean U

of M and (Michigan State Univer-
sity), those are our most highly
competitive admissions universi-
ties," Boulus said.
The jump in the national rate
sparked concern across the coun-
try. Mark Kantrowitz, founder
of the financial aid and student
loan information website Finaid.
org, said he doesn't expect unem-
ployment rates to improve in the
next four years. This would likely
cause an uptick in the default
rates since unemployed gradu-
ates are often unable to repay

their loans, he said.
Richard Williams, a higher
education associate at the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group,
wrote ina press release yesterday
that student defaults are "just the
tip of the iceberg."
"It is extremely troubling that
defaults have doubled in just the
last six years since we are looking
at just a snap shot in time which
does not capture the full magni-
tude of those borrowers default-
ing through the lifetime of their
student loans," Williams wrote.

LAWSUIT

library in order to read it.
"We're not using these books
in any way that competes with
the use of the marketplace," Cou-
rant said.
The process of digitization
is a way to preserve deteriorat-
ing books, Courant said. The
HathiTrust Digital Library began
in 2008 and now has 52 partners
worldwide.
"Mostly what we have these
(digital copies) for isto preserve
the physical books that are falling
apart," Courant said. "So, basical-
ly what we have is a backup copy
of our library."
Paul Aiken, executive director
of the Authors Guild - the lead
plaintiff in the lawsuit - said he
thinks the University's digitiza-
tion process is illegal.
The digitization is "a clear vio-
lation of (authors') copyright,"
Aiken said.

The Authors Guild and the
other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit
in order "to secure the rights of
authors and their works," Aiken
said.
The lawsuit also targets an
aspect of the digitization project
that would permit the download-
ing of books the University labels
as "orphans." According to Cou-
rant, "orphans" are books with
no copyright information avail-
able.
"We don't know who has the
copyright," Courant said. "If we
can't- find the copyright holder
after months of searching, then
we're going to allow you ... to
read that book from your laptop
at home."
Of these orphans, 27 are sched-
uled to be available for download
on Oct. 13, with another 140 to be
made available in November.
"I think that is an immedi-
ate threat," Aiken said. "The
first works are supposed to be
released under this orphan pro-
gram in a month from now, so it

gives immediacy and urgency to
the lawsuit."
But Aiken said he is equally,
if not more concerned, about
the University's ongoing digi-
tization of books. Even though
full versions of the books won't
be available online, he still has
apprehensions.
"Security is a top concern,"
Aiken said. "These works do not
belong to the universities."
According to Aiken, the plain-
tiffs are seeking an injunction
that would take the copyrighted
works off the Internet until Con-
gress addresses the issue of digi-
tal libraries. There's a proposed
settlement to the lawsuit that
would ensure the security of dig-
ital libraries at the universities,
but Aiken said he doesn't want
the books online at all.
However, Courant said he does
not think the plaintiffs will be
successful in this case.
"It's a little hard to see how
(the plaintiffs are) going to object
to (the digitization)," he said.

GRE
From Page 1A
provided. Additionally, some
questions now have multiple
correct answers, and there is no
partial credit.
Before the most recent revi-
sion, the GRE was last changed
in 2002, Lee Weiss, director of
graduate programs at Kaplan,
Inc.in Ann Arbor and a GRE
instructor. The Educational
Testing Service, which admin-
isters the test, announced in
December 2009 that it was plan-
ning to update the test again
because of feedback from gradu-
ate and business schools.
"Essentially, what (graduate
programs and business schools)
were saying was the old test was
not the most accurate represen-
tation of the skill set necessary
to succeed in graduate school,"
Weiss said.
A newly released Kaplan sur-
vey stated that because of the

new revisions, more than half of
the nation's top business school
programs are now accepting the
new GRE as an alternative to the
Graduate Management Admis-
sion Test.
With the changes, students
have expressed concern about
the extended test length, which
Weiss said he believes was
designed to test endurance and
mental stamina.
Weiss -said students should
not be too worried about the new
GRE despite the many -altera-
tions.
"From all indications, the ETS
is doing a good job of educating
graduate programs, and stu-
dents should feel very comfort-
able taking this test," he said.
University alum Jesse Song,
who graduated in April, plans
to take the GRE this year. Song
said he likes the new version of
the test a lot better because it
focuses on understanding rather
than memorization.
"As someone who has a lim-

ited lexicon but reads frequently,
the new GRE is a lot easier," he
said. "It's based more on reading
comprehension rather than just
memorizing vocabulary."
Jonathon Hung, a 2009 Uni-
versity graduate, plans to take
the GRE this year and also said
he prefers it to the old version.
"It does take some adjustment
to get used to the new question
style," Hung said. "But I think
grad schools will have a better
idea of how their applicants will
handle higher-level education."
However, University alum
Brittney Miller, who graduated
this spring, said she thinks the
revised GRE still may not be
the best test to efficiently assess
the academic abilities of future
graduate students. Miller said
she knew a few people who did
not "perform optimally" on the
GRE yet still succeeded in grad-
uate school as well as in their
careers.
"Then again, maybe those
people are outliers," Miller said.

tution'sfuture rankings will be.
"What we've seen as well
is that sometimes what gets
emphasized from year to year
can change, so it can actually
change the methodology of the

rankings and it can affect the
rank given to any university,"
he said. "So it's just really, really
unpredictable."
Fitzgerald said he is pleased
to see the University rank highly
among the nation's public uni-
versities. However, he also said
he doesn't believe rankings are
the best guidelines for students

to use when selecting a univer-
sity.
The rankings vary from year
to year, and there are various
rankings published each year,
with each emphasizing unique
factors, Fitzgerald said.
"Where you go to school or
where one of your friends goes
to school can be wildly differ-

ent than just the absolute rank
place," he said. "It's a very indi-
vidual-based decision."
Fitzgerald added that the Uni-
versity does not consider its rank
in a publication to be a priority.
"It's not something that we
focus on at all," he said. "We
think the most important factor
for the quality of a university is

the quality of its faculty, of its
teaching and of the research that
happens here - that's where we
put our emphasis."
According to the report, the
University ranks third among
the nation's undergraduate
business programs and sixth in
undergraduate engineering pro-
grams.

Among graduate programs,
the Ross School of Business
ranks 14th in the country and the
School of Education and College
of Engineering rank ninth. The
Law School has moved up two
places this year to number seven
in the nation, while the Medical
School ranks 20th for primary
care and 10th for research.

RESEARCH
From Page 1A
their perceptions of their teens'
alcohol and drug use as well as
the habits of teens in the general
population.
The full report, available on the
University Health System web-
site, states that one in four par-
ents were unsure of the extent of
their teen's alcohol and drug use.
Additionally, parents with older
teens were more likely to believe
that their children had consumed

alcohol or marijuana in the past
year.
The findings also indicated
that parents are far more likely to
believe that teenagers other than
their own have used alcohol and
drugs. According to the study,
the parents believed that at least
40 percent of 10th graders used
marijuana in the last year and that
60 percent of 10th graders drank
alcohol during the time period.
Biermann said the poll's results
were interesting but not com-
pletely surprising, as there tends
to be a lack of communication

between parents and their chil-
dren about these issues.
"Kids may have experimented
a time or two and wouldn't have
told their parents," Biermann
said. "This doesn't necessarily
suggest that all of those kids are
abusing alcohol or drugs."
According to the latest Moni-
toring the Future survey con-
ducted by the National Institute
of Drug Abuse, about 52 percent
of 10th graders reported drink-
ing alcohol in the last year and 28
percent of 10th graders report-
ed using marijuana in the past

year. This reveals a discrepancy
between parents' perceptions and
reality, Biermann said. He added
that he isn't sure what the reason
for this discrepancy is, but he sug-
gested that honest dialogue may
help parents better understand
their teens' behavior.
"Parents should talk with their
children about substance use,
safety and being responsible,"
Biermann said.
Though Biermann's study did
not account for alcohol and drug
use among college students, he
hypothesized that if surveyed,

parents would indicate more
realistic perceptions of their col-
legians' use of alcohol and mari-
juana.
"These kids have more expo-
sure to substances, and they're
certainly more at risk," he said.
"(However), colleges are provid-
ing alcohol awareness education
and really reaching out to stu-
dents to combat the problem."
LSA junior Donald Henry said
he and his parents tend to shy
away from talking about drink-
ing.
"They realize that most col-

lege-aged kids do (drink), butthey
don't want to think that I do," he
said.
Another student, who request-
ed to remain anonymous, said she
has discussed drinking with her
parents but noted that they're not
overly concerned about her hab-
its.
"(My mom) will say, just be
careful about where you put your
drink and where you get it from,"
the student said.

Later in the deposition,
Skripnikova backtracked and
said the new analysis was not dis-

day after the explosion.
"Do you believe that BP com-
plied with MMS regulations with
its selection of where the top of
cement should go in the cement
job that was done on April 19," an
attorney asked Skripnikova.
"I don't know," she responded.
Before her deposition, none
of Skripnikova's findings appear
to have been passed on to fed-
eral regulators or the numerous
government investigations since
the disaster. Skripnikova was
never questioned at public hear-
ings before the presidentially-
appointed oil spill commission.
Nor was she questioned before
the joint investigative panel of
the U.S. Coast Guard and the
agency that regulates offshore
drilling, which is readying its
final report. Her name and the
information she has is not in BP's
internal investigation report
released last September.
BP spokesman Scott Dean
insisted in a statement Tuesday
to AP that when assessing top-of-
cement requirements before the
accident, BP did not identify the
zone in question as bearing oil or
gas. Dean said "BP has provided
material concerning this zone to
the parties in the multidistrict lit-
igation and to government inves-
tigators."
BP provided a letter late last
night it said it sent the oil spill
commission on Oct. 30, 2010, six
months after the explosion. The
letter said BP would be sending
the commission draft reports
the company prepared and more
detailed studies to help inform
its efforts to stop the flow of oil to
the sea. The letter does not detail
what the reports said, what
data was provided, or whether
the data was the same as what
Skripnikova discussed in her
deposition.

isn't enough, saying Michigan
can't win with just one guy.
At times it sounds like this:
"When you have Denard Rob-
inson on your team, 30 seconds
is plenty of time to score a touch-
down," said fifth-year senior
Ryan Van Bergen of the game's
final drive. "He can run 100 yards
in under 10 seconds, so we don't

need to worry about 30 seconds
being on the clock."
But other times, it sounds like
this:
"The best teams don't depend
on one player," Borges said. "Yet,
they have that one player that can
win for them. I mean, Terry Brad-
shaw, Franco Harris, John Stall-
worth, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice.
"There's never been one guy.
There's always been - someone
else has to do something. I worry
a little bit about that. But I know
when push comes to shove, I want
the ball in his hands."
That hasn't changed. The
offense has. But just like last year,
the question persists: who can be
counted on to help Robinson?
Robinson started slowly, made
some mistakes in the middle and
was near perfect at the end. The

three interceptions really bother
Borges.
When Hoke was asked wheth-
er Robinson's game was catego-
rized as good or bad, he saidboth,
saying Robinson saved the game
but made-bad decisions at times.
Ultimately, Borges did find out
what kind of quarterback Robin-
son is - a winner, even though it
wasn't pretty.
"As you learn the offense bet
ter and understand what you're
doing better, it starts to flow,"
Borges said. "Remember when I
told you, there's going to be grow-
ingpainsinthisthing- hopefully
they're not excruciating growing
pains. And so far, we've had some.
... You'll get to the point that you
want to get, if you're just patient.
"And I think I'm talking to me
more than I'm talking to you."

Smith said she never had reser-

wants to make her peers aware
that students are actually dealing
with addiction on a daily basis.
"I feel like there is such a stigma

Smith said.

"The program is going to be a

some work with students," Harris
said. "I couldn't be any more com-
mitted to this program being a
real positive thing for the Univer-
sity and the students involved."
Harris believes the program
has been a success because of the
feeling of belonging individuals
develop in groups that offer social
support.
"With drug use, you think a lot
about peer pressure, and people
being pressured to use drugs, and
recovery - especially for the col-
lege population - kind ofturnsthat

be clean and sober to remai part

To Harris, a program like the
CRP helps students become who
they were meant to be.
"These programs are opportuni-
ties to go forwardiwith your hopes,
dreams and a future that really
matters," Harris said. "The most
exciting thing about a Collegiate
Recovery Program is that it allows
you to flourish. It is a great chance
at being the kind of person you were
supposed to be before the drugs and
alcohol got a hold of you."
Recovery in college allows stu-
dents to start again in a new place
with a new potential, Desprez said.
"Who do you know that doesn't
believe in a second chance? Col-
legiate recovery support is most
fundamentally a second chance."

DELvERY
for MornngESONN
Distributonpaper

mer Major League Baseball pitcher
from Flint who played for the Uni-
versity before moving on to the
Angels, White Sox and Yankees.
Abbott was born without a right
hand.
"She is truly the Jim Abbott of
neurosurgery - a.Michigan icon,
seemingly unaware of her dis-
ability and a living inspiration to
countless young people and her
colleagues as well," Thompson
said. "Her achievements transcend
neurosurgery, and help to redefine
understanding of the word 'handi-
capped."'
Muraszko says her job always
keeps her on her toes, but the kids
she operates on keep her going.
Like them, she understands what
it's like to live with a disability.
"When I look at kids in those
teen years - that 13 to 18 year time-
frame when everybody's awkward
and everybody's uncomfortable,
and some of these kids get very sad
and very depressed of the thought
that they are different - and what
I want to say to them is just, 'Hold
on. Hold on until you get to about
18 or 19 and everybody around you
gets more mature, and you're going
to find out that everybody's differ-
ent,' " she said.
And it's not just teens on her
operating table. Muraszko has had
to cut into newborns and prema-
ture babies shy of 24 weeks old. She
explained it's like operating on a
fetus.
"It's still not someone who has
fully matured to the point of being
a full term baby," she explained.
Over the course of a year, she
works with nearly 400 patients.
Even after operating on thousands
of children, Muraszko says she
feels privileged that parents trust
her based solely on her reputation
and knowledge.
"I walk into a room, and by vir-
tue of my title and the white coat
that I'm wearing, a parent who's
never met me before turns over the
most precious thing that they have
in their lives - their child - to my
care," she said.
In 2009, Muraszko performed
brain surgery on Ryan Smith, a
sophomore at Jackson Community
College who had Chiari malforma-
tion - a neurological disorder that
can cause migraines, anxiety and
numbness. Before the operation,
Smith had throbbing headaches
and often kept to himself.
Afterward, the headaches disap-
peared. Smith's mother, Catherine,
described in a May 2011 Michi-
gan Daily article how the surgery
transformed her son and made him
more social.
"It was like he was re-birthed at

17 and became a completely differ-
ent person," she said in the article.
She later added, "I give Dr..
Muraszko all the credit for giving
me my kid back."
Like with many professions, it's
easy to get tired and frustrated,
but Muraszko tries not to let that
show when talking to parents who
are deeply concerned about losing
their child.
"I recognize that particularly for
that patient and that family, this
interaction is paramount. And you
may be the 15th or 20th patient for
me that day, but to that family and
to that individual, you're the only
one," she said.
The stress and pressure slips
away whenever Muraszko receives
a card from patients who are now
graduating high school or are get-
ting married and having their own
kids.
"You find out that it really does
matter that you're there. ... Some-
times you can influence a life, even
just by a conversation that you
have," she said.
By saving other parents' chil-
dren, Muraszko has sacrificed time
with her own kids. Her 7-year-old
twins are often in bed when she
comes home and still sleeping
when she leaves at 5:30 a.m. from
her home in Ann Arbor. Sometimes
she won't see them for a few days
at a time.
Muraszko's husband, Scott Van
Sweringen, said they're used to
their mother being gone.
"One time I said 'Mommy's
home,' and the kids ran to the tele-
phone instead of the garage door,"
he recalled.
Muraszko admits her regular
absence bothers her.
"I'm here. It's not like I'm away,
it's not like I'm on a trip," she said.
However, like all physicians,
she's made a "sacred obligation" to
her patients, which means she may
not arrive home in time to help the
twins study for their spelling tests
every Wednesday.
The secret to having a successful
marriage as a neurosurgeon is not
to marry another neurosurgeon,
Muraszko jokes.
"If you need someone to com-
plete you, a neurosurgeon may not
be the best person to be involved
with," Muraszko said with a laugh.
"Just because we do have extreme-
ly demanding jobs."
Scott, an architect, also doesn't
put his wife on a pedestal.
"He keeps me grounded,"
Muraszko explains. "He says,
'Sweetie, just because you raise
your hand in the operating room
and instruments fall intoit, doesn't
mean that when you get out of the

operating room, that that's going to
happen."
"The reason why I love him is he
doesn't worship me."
Odette Althea Harris, president-
elect of a group called Women in
Neurosurgery, says neurosurgery is
"a challenging field for anyone," but
women neurosurgeons may find it
even harder if they're also pregnant
or trying to raise a family.
"In a profession that is so
demanding of your time, of your
energy and takes so many years
to train, those issues become aug-
mented," said Harris, an associate
professor of neurosurgery at Stan-
ford University.
Besides balancing family and
work, women neurosurgeons
face gender inequalities such as a
lower promotion rate compared
to men and a lack of female men-
tors. In 2008, Muraszko was part
of a group of surgeons who wrote
a paper on the recruitment and
retention of women in neurosur-
gery.
Despite more women than men
applying to medical school each
year since 1995, the report found
that the number of women neuro-
surgeons remains drastically low.
Each year from 1998 to 2008,
only 10 percent of neurosurgery
residents were women. As of the
late 1990s, 30 percent of neuro-
surgical residency programs had
never graduated a woman resi-
dent, according to the report.
Even the American Academy
of Neurological Surgeons - with
more than 8,000 members world-
wide - had not admitted a woman
surgeon until Muraszko joined in
2007.
However, Harris says more
women have become neurosur-
geons in the last few years and
are mentoring female medical stu-
dents to help direct, their careers.
Muraszko is one of them - acting
as a role model for Harris.
"I think she is a pioneer and a
champion. I don't have enough
good things to say about her,"
Harris said. "Her job is probably
one of the most difficult ever, and
I have nothing but praise for how
she conducts herself profession-
ally."
As more women enter a neu-
rosurgery career, Muraszko says
she knows she will not be the last
woman to head a neurosurgery
department.
"In some ways, I'm saddened
a little bit that seven years into
it, I'm still the only woman," she
said. "But I think that it's going
to change, and it will change, as
we see more women rising in the
ranks."

hough Dr. Karin Muraszko
isthe only woman leading
a neurosurgery department
in the country, her gender isn't the
only characteristic that makes her
stand out. The 4 foot 9 inch surgeon
has spina bifida - a condition that
prevents the spine from properly
developing.
"You talk about short handicap
women in neurosurgery, you're
probably defining a subset of one
- me," she said in late May while
sitting in her office adorned with
photographs and medical books.
Muraszko has been in charge of
the Department of Neurosurgery at
the University of Michigan Health
System since 2005. One of the larg-
est in the country, the department
'houses 20 neurosurgeons and nine
research faculty members who
work together to save patients from
afflictions like tragic car accident
injuries, diseases that cause people
to lose control of their hands and
brain tumors that threaten to cut
off the sense of hearing.
It's a job with a lot of responsibil-
ity, and when the department fell
into her latex-clad hands, she took
it with a surgeon's vow to not make
any accidental moves.
"Many people say that it's eas-
ier to take over something that's
a burning pulpit, meaning that
there's problems," she said. "So
for me, my job was to take a really
great department and make sure
one, I didn't ruin it, and two, make
&-it even better."
With scores of male surgeons
making medical breakthroughs

before her time, Muraszko is set-
ting the precedent as the first
female chair.
"I still feel pressure about the
fact that as the first woman, I
would hate to screw things upor to
make a mistake," she said.
Out of the 4,918 neurosurgeons
in the United States in 2008, 5.6
percent - or 277 neurosurgeons
- were women, according to the
Association of American Medical
Colleges.
With such a low percentage of
women neurosurgeons, Muraszko
has had few role models in the field.
Instead, she extracts qualities from
different people she admires and
wishes to emulate. Though she is a
third-generation female neurosur-
geon, Muraszko acknowledges that
unlike some male counterparts, she
did not face rigid expectations to
become one.
"I had to strike on my own road
and create that, so in some ways
that's liberating," she said.
Muraszko knew at age six that
she wanted to be a doctor.
As a child, Muraszko spent a lot
of time with physicians who tried
to treat her spina bifida. She was in
a body cast for over a year and also
had an operation to shorten one leg
to make it the same length as the
other.
Now 56 years old, Muraszko
remembers being impressed by the
physicians who had a large influ-
ence on her life. Striving to be like
them, she earned good grades,
received her undergraduate degree
from Yale University and attended

Columbia University for medical
school.
At first, she decided to study psy-
chiatry because she was fascinated
by the mind and people tended to
share details of their lives with her.
But that path changed during her
third year of medical school when
she did a rotation in neurology and
was required to watch an operation.
"She is truly the
Jim Abbott of
neurosurgery"
-Greg Thompson,
neurosurgeon
Muraszko vividly recalls the
procedure: The patient was a male
in his 40s with a cervicalspinal
cord ependymoma. He was losing
the ability to use his arms and hold
onto his child.
"I can remember following him
to the operating room, watching
the surgeons do this long tedious,
difficult, complex operation and
I thought, 'Oh my God. Here they
are in the middle of this guy's cer-
vical (spinal cord) taking out this
tube,' and the fact that we could
get in there, take it out and he
would wake up after the operation,
actually move his arms, be able to
breathe ... it was just fascinating."
But the awestruck student knew

entering a neurosurgery career
was not as simple as filling out a job
application.
"I had to test myself because as
a person with a disability, I wanted
to make sure that my desire to do
something wasn't going to get in
the way of my ability to take care of
any patients," she said.
After completing medical school
with flying colors, Muraszko con-
vinced the faculty of Columbia
University that she could handle
the school's arduous seven-year
residency. She became the first
handicapped person to be offered
the position, though not without
debate.
In 1983, Dr. Bennett Stein, chair-
man of Columbia's, Neurological
Surgery Department at the time,
said in a New York Times article
that the department did "a lot of
soul-searching" before admitting
Muraszko.
"We were concerned that her
handicap might prevent her from
doing the work," Stein said in the
article. "We have found, though,
that her intelligence, tenacity and
motivation have enabled her to
make a remarkable contribution to
the care of our patients."
Nearly 30 years later, the same
holds true for the University Hos-
pital. Muraszko came to Michigan
in 1990 as a pediatric neurosur-
geon. She said she chose Michigan
because she liked how surgeons
worked together "arm in arm."
"It's not that people are so ego-
centric that they're in competition
with each other," she said, as doc-

tors clad in white lab coats and blue
scrubs scurried outside her office.
"We kind of view it as a team sport,
and the only enemy on the team is
disease. It's not each other, it's not
other people, it's really working to
take care of the patient as best as
you can."
Besides treating patients,
Muraszko trained students who
have gone on to become top doctors
in the field. Her most recognizable
pupil? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's
chief medical correspondent and
associate chief of neurosurgery at
Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlan-
ta.
In Atlanta, Gupta sat in his CNN
office full, of medical books, glass
awards and half of a human skel-
eton and raved about Muraszko's
personality and teaching style.
"She's a phenomenal person,
(from) what she's accomplished
certainly, but also her approach to
life and her ability to toggle from
operating on a meningioma blasto-
ma to making sure that the resident
that she's training in front of her is
living a good life, has good priori-
ties and is going to be a good per-
son," Gupta said.
"That was really important to
her so Iappreciate that more about
her now that I'm in those shoes
training residents - how impor-
tant it is to train good people as
well as good doctors."
Back in Michigan, Greg Thomp-
son, a John E. McGillicuddy Col-
legiate professor of neurosurgery
who works with Muraszko, com-
pared her to James Abbott - a for-

so critical," Desprez said. "They want to be
connected, they want to have fun and they
want to feel connected to the Michigan com-
munity."
Desprez said the CRP is about social justice,
which makes the University a perfect place for
the program to flourish.
"If we have students on this campus that
don't think it's a safe place to be, that's a social
justice issue," she said.
"It is important for students who aren't in
recovery to have some awareness that they
are in class with students who are in recovery,
so that when they think about having a party,
that there are things to do other than drinking
games."
Afterremodelingthe Health Promotion and
Community Relations section on the fourth
floor of the University Health Service build-
ing this summer, the program manifested into
something tangible and possible.
Now a space exists "so that people ... could
just come and hang out and get out of the rat
race of hearing all the talk (about alcohol),"
Desprez said.
"It's the same theory behind why fraterni-
ties have frat houses - so that like-minded
people go to the same place," Cervi added.
"Eventually, what we would someday hope
to have ... a space on campus, and this is the
beginnings of it."
Cervi's role in spearheading the program
required extensive-research, including calling
the 15 universities that have existing programs
and selecting components that the University
might use for its own program.
Cervi also meets with students who are in
early recovery, once per week, to see what they
need in order to survive in the college atmo-
sphere.
"Some come with already established
recovery habits, but they are really generous
and are willing to mentor students that are in
recovery," Cervi said. "When you have a grad-
uate student who is five years sober and when

you have an 18 year old that is one year sober,
and to see proof that they can do it - that is.
awesome."
"The services have to be more individual-

they need," Cervi added.
Cervi succeeded in making sure University
Housing was on board with special accom-
modations for students in recovery, includ-
ing special housing for those who are trying
to remain sober. In the University's housing
application, there is now a separate housing
option for students in recovery. This fall, four
students took advantage of that option and live
in a place that provides recovery resources.
The challenges of recovery
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are held in
the Michigan Union every Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.
These meetings have been a helpful resource
for students in the program, giving students
chips to signify milestones in sobriety and
helping them through the 12-step program.
According to Cervi, the CRP has even succeed-
ed in negotiating with the University to accept
recovering students with criminal records.
Desprez has hopes of obtaining a bigger
space, more financial support, a separate pro-
gram coordinator and possibly scholarships
for recovering students in the future. She also
thinks that the program coordinator should
be in recovery as well. However, because of
her position in the Alcohol and Other Drug
Prevention program and her dedication to the
creation of the CRP, she became the program's
head.
"Sometimes a recovering student needs to
look across the table at a recovering addict and
think 'You get me,"' Desprez said.
Desprez said the program also needs to
learn to address the ever-present possibility
of relapse.
"One of the facts of recovery is that there
can be relapse, and it's just part of it," Desprez

said. "You don't just go, 'Oh well, sorry.' You less taboo to talk about recovery and addic-
