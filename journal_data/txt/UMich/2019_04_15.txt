The University of Michigan 
Museum of Natural History 
reopened on Sunday at its 
new location in the Biological 
Sciences Building. This marks 
the second of three phases 
of officially reopening the 
museum, with the third to 
occur in fall 2019.
Plans to build the new 
Biological Sciences Building 
began 
in 
2011, 
and 
the 
University decided to move 
the museum into the new 
building. The museum was 
housed 
in 
the 
Ruthven 
Museums Building starting in 
1928 and officially closed its 
doors at the end of 2017.
The University’s Board of 
Regents approved the $261 
million construction of the 
Biological Sciences Building in 
2014. The building houses the 
museum in addition to research 
laboratories, 
department 
offices, classrooms and study 
spaces.
Lori 
Ann 
Dick, 
manager of marketing and 
communications 
for 
the 
museum, 
cited 
modern 
research needs as one of the 
reasons 
the 
museum 
was 
moved 
from 
its 
previous 
location 
at 
the 
Ruthven 
Building. About half of the 
specimens are from the old 
museum, while the other half 
are new.
Another purpose of moving 
the museum to the new 

Biological Sciences Building, 
Dick said, was to show the 
work of University scientists 
and researchers to the public.
“(The University) decided 
to also include the museum 
so that we could be the public 
face of the research that goes 
on at U of M,” Dick said. 
“The museum winds its way 
through the labs … and the 
museum’s on three floors, so 
visitors do get the opportunity 
to look into labs and see actual 
scientists work.”
LSA 
senior 
Jianella 
Macalino 
began 
working 
as a student docent at the 
Museum of Natural History 
her sophomore year when 
it was still located at the 
Ruthven Building. Macalino 
said she appreciates the new 
perspective 
the 
museum 

offered her, in terms of both 
the exhibits and the visitors.
“I am one of the lucky ones 
who worked in Ruthven and 
then transitioned over to here, 
so I experienced every step of 
the move from over there to 
over here … and seeing how 
differently we can interact 
with the same specimens from 
that building to this building 
and different ways we can 
teach people and learn and 
interact with the public has 
been super interesting to me,” 
Macalino said.
The museum employed a 
wristband distribution system 
to accommodate over 3,000 
guests who visited the museum 
for its grand opening. Although 
exhibits and attractions like 
the planetarium and student 
showcase 
opened 
Sunday, 

three more major exhibits will 
be opening in November in the 
third phase of the museum’s 
relocation. In addition to the 
exhibits and labs, guests can 
also dine at Darwin’s Cafe 
or purchase gifts from the 
museum store.
LSA 
sophomore 
Leanne 
Olona 
is 
also 
a 
student 
docent 
at 
the 
museum. 
Olona described the positive 
ambiance of the museum and 
of her fellow employees, which 
she said enriches the guests’ 
experience.
“I genuinely think this is 
a really good student job, the 
staff here is really supportive,” 
Olona said. 

Presidential 
hopeful 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
D-Vermont, 
returned to the campaign trail in 
Michigan on Saturday, pitching 
himself as an alternative to 
President Donald Trump in 
2020. Sanders spoke to more 
than a thousand people at a rally 
at Macomb Community College 
in 
Warren, 
criticizing 
the 
Trump administration while 
calling for universal healthcare 
and economic policy to confront 
stagnating wages and declining 
mobility. 
His 
campaign 
stop 
in 
Michigan was part of a tour 
of 
Midwestern 
states 
that 
voted 
for 
Trump 
in 
2016, 
including Wisconsin, Ohio and 
Pennsylvania. Sanders said he 
intended to build on his victory 
in 
Michigan’s 
Democratic 
primary in 2016, when he 
defeated 
former 
Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton to 
the surprise of pollsters and 
pundits.

Over 100 residents of Grand 
Rapids, Detroit and Washtenaw 
County gathered at the new Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
Saturday 
for the third annual Men of Color 
Symposium. This year’s theme was 
“Finding Your Flow.”
The symposium’s co-coordinator, 
Andrew Ward, an interim program 
manager for Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs, said the idea for the 
symposium grew from another 
MESA 
program, 
My 
Brothers 
Empowerment, a monthly lunch 
series for men of color. Ward said the 
participants decided three years ago 
that they wanted a more expansive 
outlet for their work.
“The Men of Color Symposium 
was created just to create space for 
people to come together and build 
community and have an opportunity 

to foster relationships and grow and 
create space where conversations 
could happen to essentially support 
one another,” Ward said.
There are participants from across 
the campus and across the state who 
come together for a day to recognize 
their position in higher education. 
Ward said because he has only held his 
position at MESA for a few months, 
the symposium has been his biggest 
undertaking so far.
“This is a concept that was created 
to invite other community members, 
other interest groups who are looking 
for a space to connect with other people 
of color to talk about different diversity 
issues and initiatives that affect being 
a person of color on campus, especially 
here at U of M being a predominantly 
white institution,” Ward said.

Fox Theater hosts former president, former Secretary of State as part of national tour

In front of an audience of more 
than 5,000 at Fox Theater in Detroit 
Friday evening, former President 
Bill Clinton and former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton spoke to a 
crowd about the state of American 
democracy, growing resentment 

toward present-day political figures 
and life as retired public servants. 
The talk, which was moderated 
by actor Ben Stiller, was part of a 
nationwide tour titled “An Evening 
With the Clintons” that aimed to 
give attendees an inside look into 
the workings of the American gov-
ernment. The Clintons also gave 
voters advice on how to proceed in 

today’s political climate, which they 
said was increasingly polarized.. 
During the 75-minute show, Bill 
Clinton urged voters to advocate for 
their beliefs ethically without criti-
cizing or berating the other side. He 
noted how the tense political situa-
tion today is a result of this kind of 
“us against them” mentality. 
“If you spend all of your time 

just dumping on people because 
they’re the object of your resent-
ment, it won’t make you happy, it 
won’t empower you, it won’t change 
somebody else’s life for the better,” 
Bill Clinton said.

SOUTH BEND, IN — Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg 
officially 
announced his candidacy for 
president of the United States 
Sunday 
afternoon 
in 
South 
Bend, Indiana. Crowds began 
to gather as early as 8 a.m. for 
the 2:30 p.m. announcement, 
with thousands of supporters 
packing into the town’s former 
Studebaker automaker factory. 
If elected, Buttigieg would 
not only be the first openly gay 
president but also the country’s 
youngest president at 37 years 
old. 
The factory building where 
the event took place stood 

as a symbol for the Buttigieg 
campaign and the triumphs 
of his mayorship. Studebaker 
shut its doors in 1963, leaving a 
devastated economy in its wake. 
Now, the former factory is being 
rebuilt as a hub for regional tech 
and business startups. 
Buttigieg was born and raised 
in South Bend. He is Harvard-
educated, a Rhodes scholar and 
an Afghanistan War veteran. 
After 
completing 
his 
tour 
overseas, he decided to return 
home to South Bend.
As 
mayor, 
Buttigieg 
has 
prided himself on his efforts to 
revitalize the town’s economy. 
He 
recognized 
South 
Bend 
would 
never 
have 
another 
Studebaker and worked to seek 
out other forms of revenue. He 

said instead of trying to return 
to the way things were he 

decided to look to the future. 
“There is no such thing 
as an honest politics that 
revolves around the word 
‘again’,” Buttigieg said. 
A number of other mayors 
came out to support Buttigieg 
at the event, including Nan 
Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, 
and Christopher Cabaldon 
of 
West 
Sacramento, 
California, 
who 
each 
delivered opening remarks. 
In their eyes, a small-town 
mayor is exactly who the 
country needs in the Oval 
Office.
Steve Adler, the mayor 
of Austin, Texas, also came 
out in support Buttigieg, a 
notable move in a primary 
that 
will 
included 
two 
Texas-based 
politicians. 
Adler refered to him as “a 
Mayor’s Mayor.”
“Wouldn’t it be great if we 
had a president who knows 
that freedom is sacred and 
sometimes ‘freedom to,’ like 
freedom to be who you are 
and to love who you want 
is as important as freedom 
from someone you fear?” 
Adler said. 

Buttigieg 
announced 
his 
campaign would be built upon 
the pillars of freedom, security 
and democracy. 
“Security 
means 
cyber 
security,” Buttegieg said. “It 
means 
election 
security. 
It 
means keeping us safe in the 
face of violent white nationalism 
rearing its ugly head. Let’s pick 
our heads up to face what might 
be the greatest security of our 
time — climate change and 
climate destruction.”
Buttigieg 
argued 
as 
a 
millennial 
he 
is 
the 
only 
candidate who will be alive to 
see the impacts of global climate 
change. He issued a challenge to 
Republican politicians.
 “If you don’t like our plans 
on climate, fine, show us yours,” 
Buttigieg said.
Public Policy senior CJ Meyer 
traveled from Ann Arbor to see 
the event. 
“The Democratic field is all 
within the same ballpark when 
it comes to policy,” Mayer wrote 
in an email interview. “What 
distinguishes Mayor Pete is his 
messaging and his language. 
He has a unique ability to frame 
policy 
challenges, 
such 
as 
climate change and healthcare, 
and American values, such as 
freedom and religion, in a way 
that no Democrat has in decades. 
Between his framing abilities 
and his impressive experience, 
he represents for both urgency 
and action, and he’s a new type 
of candidate.”
Buttigieg 
has 
gained 
momentum 
over 
the 
past 
months, already accruing nearly 
$7 million dollars in campaign 
donations but said there is 
still work ahead in a crowded 
Democratic field.
“The 
horror 
show 
in 
Washington 
is 
mesmerizing, 
it’s all consuming, but starting 
today we’re gonna change the 
channel,” Buttigieg said.

Pete Buttigieg formally announces 
candidacy to run for president in 2020

Mayor of South Bend, IN already raised nearly $7 million in campaign donations


As a child, I never worried 
about making mistakes. If my 
knees were scraped when playing 
outside, they healed, so I stood on 
the highest playground structure 
trying to look past the horizon. 
Growing up, I continued having 
this dauntless quality, always 
questioning how I could change 
the color of the sky or how I 
could solve a derivative in an 
unconventional way. For this 
reason, the liberating medium of 
acrylic paints became my favorite 
style of art. The 4 foot tall canvas 
allows a full range of motion as 
well as the ability to use brushes, 
knives, paper, and even my fingers 
to capture emotion when the 
paint is wet. And when the paint 
dries, I can keep adding layers. 
With this medium, I can be a child 
again, exploring and imagining 
ideas as crazy as I can make them.
This trait of dauntlessness has 
helped me accomplish goals and 
is still teaching me lessons of what 
it means to succeed. As a woman, 
a woman of color, and a woman 
of color with immigrant parents, 
it takes more effort to achieve 
the same as others. I have heard 
countless stories of the challenges 
that women of color face, and how 
they overcome them.
In my painting, I chose to 
encompass 
facial 
features 
of different women. But, the 

sparkling eyes and determined 
eyebrows of these women tell 
stories and challenge stereotypes. 
A few things I wanted to touch 
on in my painting are femininity, 
sports, clothing, career, and the 
reason why women of color are 
queens.
The flowers represent my own 
femininity and the challenges 
women have to face in a 
patriarchal society. If we speak 
up or act a certain way, we are 
criticized. We are not taught to 
fight and triumph. But, for me, 
being feminine means being able 
to fall down and still get up. Being 
a woman of color means to fight 
for what’s right.
The pattern of a soccer ball 
represents sports. I have seen so 
many female athletes criticized 
for being too muscular, or not 
feminine enough. Even though 
Serena Williams has won 23 grand 
slams, the reality of the news and 
modern world is that there will 
always be people criticizing her. 
It dawned on me that I would 
face challenges like she does, 
constantly having to prove myself 
in the face of stereotypes against 
women in sports.
Being 
a 
student 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
has 
given me the opportunity to 
interact with so many other 
women of color. For all my peers 
who wear a hijab, it represents 
dignity, modesty, and faith, and 
they reserve the right to choose 

to wear one or not. Personally, 
I want the choice to be able to 
wear a bindi and be accepted 
in this community, because my 
choice is my choice, and it’s my 
responsibility to educate myself 
about the choices of others.
The blue collar and white 
collar at the bottom of the 
painting represent women of 
color in various careers. I chose 
engineering without knowing 
what I really wanted to do. Like 
every other brown kid, if you are 
good at math or science, this is the 
field for you. No, I’m just kidding. 
Anyways, when I tell people I 
study engineering, I get awe and 
wonder, but sometimes, there is 
doubt in them, and even in myself. 
How would I survive or gain 
respect in such a competitive and 
male dominated industry? Today, 
I’m still an engineer because I 
want to change the mindset of 
people that a woman of color 
with the goal of being a CEO or 
wiring NASA’s rocket ship, is 
unstoppable.
Finally, women of color are 
queens. We are fighting for what 
we deserve, and speaking up in 
spaces like this one. We shouldn’t 
need another world war to prove 
that women are capable in the 
workplace, or that they can thrive 
in sport. We need compassion, 
strength, and love, to shape the 
world into not a kingdom, but a 
Queen’dom.

Michigan in Color
Monday, April 15, 2019 — 3A

On Friday night, among the 
smooth rhythms of 90s R&B, the 
vibrant LED lights reflecting from 
the stage and the nostalgic smell of 
soul food, Black creatives packed 
the basement of the new William 
Monroe Trotter Multicultural for 
the 2nd annual Creatives of Color 
Showcase. Creatives of Color, an 
organization started last year 
by LSA senior Drew Metcalfe 
through 
OptiMize’s 
Social 
Innovation Challenge, connects 
Black 
creatives 
across 
the 
University of Michigan’s campus. 
It provides a space for Black 
artists to connect and produce art 
specific to their experiences and 
their culture.
The 
showcase 
featured 
artists from a variety of artistic 
mediums, who created projects 
or 
presentations 
after 
being 
randomly put into groups. Among 
these creatives were rappers, 
dancers, poets, filmmakers, actors, 
musicians, singers, visual artists 
and more. During each act or 
presentation, audience members 
clapped, laughed and embraced 
their fellow creatives, displaying 
the joy in Black ingenuity and 
finally having a space to revel in it.
This year’s showcase proved to 

be extra-special because it was the 
inaugural event, after the ribbon-
cutting, for the new Trotter 
Center. President Drew Metcalf 
talked about the importance of the 
showcase being the new Trotter’s 
kick-off event.
“We’re the first big event in 
here and that’s groundbreaking, it 
feels special. Definitely a lot better 
than 
our 
previous 
locations, 
we have official staging now,” 
Metcalf said. “I’m just excited 
about the progress we’ve made. 
We got to have events here all day. 
We were painting upstairs and 
we got to curate the art gallery. 
Having access to that kind of stuff 
in such in a new building, as a new 
org, feels really encouraging and 
positive.”
The showcase’s placement in 
the new Trotter center reflects 
the goal Metcalf set out to 
accomplish a year ago: to create 
an 
imaginative 
environment 
for Black artists to share their 
work and gather in the name of 
originality and ingenuity. The 
center lends itself to collaboration 
and acts as a unified space for 
Black creatives to explore their 
artistry. Committee Head of 
Performative Art, Kandis Terry, 
spoke about her decision to join 
the Executive Board of Creatives 
of Color.

“A lot of times I’m usually the 
only person of color, the only 
Black person, let alone Black 
woman in the spaces that I’m in 
and when (Drew) said he had 
this idea for collaboration for all 
artists on campus, it was a chance 
for me to help other people get 
comfortable in their art,” Terry 
said. “Art doesn’t have to be 
something that’s so serious, it 
should be a form of expression and 
mental wellness. People who are 
so good at it are good at it because 
it’s something that they have to 
do. It’s an impulse…. This space is 
very open, it doesn’t feel limited, 
there’s no cap on it. There’s space 
for everyone to be a creative 
person of color.”
Treasurer Clarence Womack 
also talked about the significance 
of creating opportunities for 
Black creatives on campus and 
why he joined the trailblazing 
organization.
“I joined Creatives of Color 
to support my friends and their 
decisions to support people in 
the Black community. There 
weren’t a lot of opportunities 
for artist of color to collaborate 
(or) understand other people’s 
talent,” Womack said. 

On 
March 
14, 
Netflix 
announced it was cancelling its 
original series One Day at a Time. 
The streaming giant’s decision 
came after several appeals by 
the cast, other Latinx celebrities 
(including Hamilton creator Lin-
Manuel Miranda) and viewers to 
save the show.
On the surface, One Day At 
A Time is like any other family 
sitcom, with a close nuclear family 
and a wild cast of friends, but it 
distinguishes itself by centering 
around a Cuban-American veteran 
and her multi-generational family.
Replete 
with 
cultural 
references, the Cuban, Latinx, 
and recent immigrant identities 
permeate beyond the odd joke 
here or there: they drive the 
show. Rita Moreno – who is best 
known as Maria from West Side 
Story – plays the staunchly Cuban 
grandmother Lydia, who fled Cuba 
as a teenager in the 60s. Her desire 
to follow tradition brings her into 
conflict with her American-born 
grandchildren Alex (played by 
Marcel Ruiz) and Elena (played 
by Isabella Gomez), as well as her 
newly-divorced daughter Penelope 
(played by Justina Machado).
The show plunges headfirst 

into the Alvarez family’s inherent 
Cubanness, using white supporting 
characters to introduce less well-
known concepts. Instead of the 
Alvarezs having to ditch their 
heritage to conform to mainstream 
American culture, their friends Dr. 
Berkowitz (Stephen Tobolowsky) 
and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) 
learn what it means to be Cuban 
and become part of the family.
One Day At A Time presents 
more than racial diversity: the 
show endeavors to cover a wide 
range of issues from sexual 
harassment to the flaws in Veteran 
Affairs to recreational drug use. 
More than simply touching on 
them, the series gives plenty of time 
to each topic and handles them 
sensitively. No matter how dire the 
situation may seem, the Alvarez’s 
always find some kind of way to 
solve the problem or otherwise 
have a happy ending. It’s a staple 
of the feel-good sitcom genre, but 
given how serious these issues are, 
it is incredibly well done and never 
seeks to minimize the impact they 
can have on individuals.
You don’t have to be Cuban 
or even Latinx to find the show 
relatable. Many of us in the 
broader 
immigrants 
of 
color 
community can find themselves 
in the Alvarez’s. In one episode, 
Lydia warns her grandchildren 

that walking on the floor barefoot 
can cause them to catch colds. 
This reminded me of my Chinese 
grandmother scolding me for 
sleeping 
with 
my 
hair 
wet 
because cold air would rush into 
my follicles and give me a cold. 
(Obviously, neither of these bad 
habits are desirable, but I’m still 
skeptical of anything any grandma 
tells me that a doctor won’t.)
There are already so few shows 
starring people of color that 
losing One Day At A Time comes 
at a major cost. UCLA’s annual 
Hollywood Diversity Report found 
that there was fewer than one lead 
of color for every two white leads 
in scripted digital series alone. Not 
getting to see positive and deeply 
explored depictions of people like 
us informs us that our experiences 
are unimportant and not valued – 
which is far from the truth.
Netflix may have cancelled One 
Day At A Time, but that doesn’t 
necessarily mean that the series 
is gone for good. As showrunner 
Gloria Calderón Kellett continues 
to fight for, the show can continue 
if picked up by another network.

A Time by watching the three

The Gray, White, Black, and 
Gold teams competed against 
each other on the night of April 
10th for the second annual 
“Train Like an Alpha” event in 
the Mendelssohn Theatre in the 

Michigan League.
Flashing lights, Old Town 
Road and whistles echoed the 
theatre, and the energy of the 
crowd matched that of the four 
teams of girls who danced to the 
coordinated routines of current 
members of the fraternity, Alphi 
Phi Alpha.
For their annual event, Alpha 
Phi Alpha holds campus-wide 

tryouts for girls who want to 
try their hand at some of the 
fraternity’s 
dances 
and 
step 
routines for their hand at the 
grand prize. Each routine had a 
specific theme or reference, and 
their uniqueness showed in each 
of their choreographed dances. 
The Gray Team started the 
night off with an “Indiana Jones”-
esque adventure theme, decked 
out in gray tank tops, green cargo 
pants, and black utility belts –– 
their energy was definitely felt 
by the audience. The girls were 
on a mission to find the “golden 
whistle” before it fell into the 
wrong hands. With a routine full 
of clean moves and gymnastics 
feats, the night was off to a good 
start.
However, the following two 
teams still held their ground 
pretty well. The White team had a 
sporty workout theme with all of 
the dancers clad in workout bras 
and joggers. Their clever routine 
started with a nod to the Everest 

college commercial that was 
familiar to the Michigan natives 
who grew up seeing it on their TV.
Next was the Black Team. 
Dressed in black unitards with 
black and gold accent pieces, 
they channeled the energy of the 
character Katana from the video 
game Mortal Kombat in an action 
packed fight theme routine. The 
routine stayed true to the theme 
of the game and their steps were 
sharply executed.
All the teams kept their 
routines lighthearted and fun 
by adding in voiceover moments 
where they’d stop and narrate on 
the action. They also involved the 
brothers of the Alpha Phi Alpha 
fraternity as characters in their 
skits between the dance moves. 
In between the performances, 
the energy was also kept high by 
the light hearted MCs who made 
playful jabs at the competition 
and 
themselves. 
Audience 
members also got a chance to be 
involved in the fun through trivia 

contests, lottery drawings, and a 
riveting competition to see who 
could hold the fraternity’s famous 
hand sign the longest without 
falling.
Last but certainly not least was 
the gold team. Their performance 
ended the night with a high-
energy performance that used 
vibrant colors and the benefit of 
stage lighting to execute their 
routine. With a nightclub theme, 
they certainly brought energy 
that the audience could feel and 
the confidence of the performers 
with every stomp and clap that 
lined their performance.
In the end, the judges seemed 
to really admire the gold team’s 
ingenuity because the won the 
competition. 
Each 
member 
received a gold medal and took 
a picture with the giant trophy 
that was awarded to them as a 
result of their performance. With 
every team member on stage as 
well as the fraternity members 
who helped to choreograph each 

routine, everyone joined in to 
dance to the organization’s go-to 
stroll song, “Knuck if You Buck.”
Even though the gold team 
won, it’s safe to say that all of the 
dancers still had fun. According 
to 
School 
of 
Information 
sophomore Leila Akan, a dancer 
on the Black Team, the best part 
of the competition was getting to 
know and work with everyone on 
her team. “Our practices were a 
lot of long late nights, but in the 
end everyone pulled off a great 
show and I’m extremely proud of 
them.”
The “Train Like an Alpha” 
Event was definitely a night to 
remember as it succeeded in 
making an evening of excitement 
and energy to a Wednesday 
night for Black students. Current 
students and alumni alike, for a 
night of dancing, laughing and 
merriment. Even though this 
was the event’s second time 
happening, it’s easy to see that it 
will continue for years to come.

W

alking 
south 
of 
campus 
with 
my 
sweet 
shades 
on 
and 
headphones 
in blocking out the 
darties 
nearby, 
I 
strut 
down 
the 
street in a fantastic 
mood, 
leaving 
my 
winter blues behind 
me. 
Welcome 
to 
springtime 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
which 
essentially 
means 
summer, 
where 
people wear basically 
no clothes even in 60-degree 
weather, spend all their time 
outside and avoid all of their 
school work. I was feeling quite 
dramatic and nostalgic listening 
to 
my 
graduation-themed 
Spotify playlist, “sad sad end of 
an eraaaaa” when I approached 
my beloved cooperative house. I 
stopped on the sidewalk looking at 
my home for a moment and smiled 
knowing for the first time that I 
was ready to leave her.
After 
a 
few 
months 
of 
panicking about post-graduation 
plans and being immersed in so 
many enjoyable last events with 
my close friends, I have come to a 
new place of confidence, security 
and acceptance about graduating. 
With only a few weeks left, I have 
been reflecting on my time here 
and comparing my current self to 
the version who first enrolled in 
college. Looking back, I was a real 
“know it all,” thinking nothing 
would change about myself in 
college. I really thought I wasn’t 
learning anything new from my 
classes and even wrote a column 
about how I wanted to graduate 
early so I could just begin a 
master’s program in something 
I actually wanted to study. 
Re-reading this, even though it felt 
so real to me at the moment, I find 
it funny how I didn’t think I could 
learn, evolve or grow more from 
the rest of my time in undergrad. 
Now, I find myself with no 
post-graduation plans probably 
due to procrastinating job and 
program applications out of the 
fear of making a decision too 
quickly that could change my life. I 
wouldn’t say I am particularly bad 

at change. I am a flexible person 
who loves being spontaneous, not 
having a plan and figuring things 
out with limited time. 
I lived in a cooperative 
house for the past two 
and a half years where 
the people and culture 
have 
transformed 
every 
semester. 
However, 
knowing 
there 
is 
a 
date 
approaching when my 
day-to-day life will be 
inevitably 
different 
makes this transition 
time even scarier and emotional.
When I entered college, I 
was always confused about why 
everyone called it the best years 
of their life because I was pretty 
miserable, even after I transferred 
to the University of Michigan 
in search of a better experience. 
The transition was more difficult 
than I had predicted but gave me 
the shift in my college experience 
I was looking for. With time and 
putting myself outside my comfort 
zone, I was satisfied with my new 
community of friends, activities 
and classes. Even if I didn’t feel 
like I was evolving and changing, 
every class, new friendship and 
experience helped me to grow and 
create the person I see myself as 
today.
Though I know my next 
transition will look and feel 
different 
from 
my 
transition 
from one university to another, 
this experience has prepared 
me to take on new challenges. 
Hopefully, with some time and 
distance from being a student this 
summer, I can enter post-college 
life in search of a plan or job that 
will lead me into the “real world.” 
But I think this time, I’m aware of 
how hard this transition is going 
to be and the time it takes to deal 
with new situations, trying new 
things that are uncomfortable and 
building a new community.
At the end of last month, I 
watched the finale of my all-
time favorite show on television, 
“Broad City,” which showed two 
best friends who had to move 
away from each other due to 
new opportunities. It could have 
not been timelier because I have 

quickly 
realized 
the 
saddest 
part of graduating will be losing 
my everyday community of my 
soulmates, besties, friends and 
casual acquaintances that are a 
short walk away. My social life and 
community I spent the last years 
building will look different after 
graduation, and it was already 
impacted last May when several 
of my close friends graduated. I 
came to this morbid conclusion 
that in college, your friends leave 
you and eventually you will leave 
as well. Though it is so upsetting 
to think this way, it is important 
to realize this period of life is 
very temporary. We may have the 
technology to stay in contact but 
things will never be the same as 
they are right now. 
Throughout my time at the 
University, all of the relationships 
I gained have already impacted 
who I am, the decisions I made 
in my time here and those I’ll 
make in the future. I know it 
sounds sappy, but I truly feel 
grateful to my friends for showing 
me how to be confident in my 
skills and to love and take care 
of myself during stressful times 
in college. They introduced me 
to the different communities I 
joined here on campus like my 
cooperative house, which gave me 
an instant community with like-
minded individuals who became 
my family, and The Michigan 
Daily, where I realized I could be 
a writer. Being a columnist and 
a former editor in the Opinion 
section allowed me to reflect on 
my experiences and gave me a 
platform to write about things I 
cared about.
So now, reaching the end, 
every time I hear someone say 
the number of days we have left 
in this semester it makes me quite 
nauseous, and most of the time 
my reflex is to yell “shut up!” But 
even with all of these feelings, 
I’m still looking forward to my 
future experiences wherever I 
end up. Even if they may not be 
as exciting as the last four years, 
it’s important to remember that 
undergrad is only temporary. 

MILES STEPHENSON | COLUMN

On country music
W

henever I ask people 
at the University of 
Michigan what kind 
of music they like, I usually hear, 
“I listen to a wide variety of music. 
I like all genres except country.” 
After hearing this account dozens 
of times, I began to wonder if there 
was some intrinsic flaw in country 
music or if this was indicative of 
a demographic who believe it’s 
trendy to dislike country. After 
all, most people who condemn 
an entire genre lack a formal 
education in music. Any musician 
will tell you that every genre from 
jangle pop to bluegrass has the 
potential for great musicality and 
meaning.
Born and raised in the city 
of New York, I didn’t properly 
encounter 
country 
and 
its 
subgenres until high school, where 
I began to personalize my music 
taste more intently. I discovered the 
charm, beauty and romanticism 
that the genre has to offer and 
began to follow artists like Chris 
Stapleton, later encountering Eric 
Church, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, 
Jason Isbell, Tyler Childers, Jake 
Owen and Toby Keith. Zac Brown 
Band’s “Chicken Fried” introduced 
pop country to new demographics 
while Lil Nas X’s “Old Town 
Road” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus 
has recently become a widespread 
cultural meme. Attend any party 
on campus this month, even those 
populated with lifelong urbanites, 
and you will hear “Old Town 
Road” played at least once, perhaps 
ironically or perhaps sincerely.
For years now, rap has replaced 
rock as the predominant popular 
genre 
in 
America. 
However, 
rappers like Lil Nas X and even 
Post Malone are bridging the gap 
between 
mainstream 
popular 
music and country, and for the 
first time in my life, it’s becoming 
trendy for urban demographics on 
the West and East Coasts to enjoy 
country music. But what’s holding 
country back from becoming the 
mainstream genre?
I asked students across campus 
about their thoughts on country 
and why it’s perceived the way 
it is by the urban elite that this 
university attracts. One sophomore 
said the following: “In terms of a 
bad rep, I think that in 2019, with 
social media especially ... people 
see country music as the anti-rap 

music, and rap music is perceived 
as cool. What they are in my mind 
is cultural representations, and so I 
understand how that can be hated 
but as someone from Nashville, 
it’s my cultural music and music I 
really enjoy.”
Another 
sophomore 
said, 
“It’s associated with ‘rednecks’ 
who have a negative stigma … 
and conservatives, who are also 
perceived negatively in many 
parts of the country,” while a third 
interviewee stated anti-country 
rhetoric is tied to the South’s 
negative reputation with racism.
Toby Keith’s “The Taliban 
Song,” 
though 
melodic 
and 
narratively romantic, reminds us 
of the cultural offensiveness that 
people attribute to the genre with 
lyrics like, “I’m just a middle-aged 
Middle-Eastern 
camel-herdin’ 
man … I’ve got a little two bedroom 
cave here in north Afghanistan.” 
Like all genres, some country 
can make people uncomfortable 
and push societal norms. One 
freshman 
student 
interviewed 
argued this song is an example of 
cultural appropriation and that 
Keith 
inappropriately 
adopted 
the story of an Afghan citizen to 
weaponize their story for jingoistic 
propaganda. Though I agree that 
Keith could have represented 
Afghan people with more nuance 
and respect, and that the song’s 
account of American intervention 
in the Middle East strays from 
reality, I find fault with the thesis 
that telling a story about a different 
culture 
automatically 
equates 
cultural appropriation. This kind 
of thinking can lead to another 
form of tribal bigotry: the belief 
that art should be ethnically or 
nationalistically coded, and that 
an artist can’t tell a story about a 
character from a different way of 
life. 
While “The Taliban Song” 
raises questions about country’s 
past, Kane Brown’s hit “Good 
As You” brings to country a 
sensibility unique to a white, 
Black and Cherokee multiracial 
identity. 
Midland’s 
“Drinkin’ 
Problem (Brindemos)” features 
Mexican artist Jay De La Cueva’s 
entirely Spanish verses. Of course, 
we should be focused on the 
musicality of an artist, not their 
race or nationality, but in a culture 
where identity is on everyone’s 

minds, these artists and their 
musical contributions help lend a 
new modern face to country.
Like rap and hip-hop, the 
country genre also integrates 
masculine aggression into music. 
This is one of the reasons rap is 
so attractive to young, upwardly 
mobile males. Many people often 
wonder why Sperry-wearing high 
schoolers from Connecticut flock 
to rap concerts in the hundreds. 
While debates rage on about toxic 
masculinity, condemning signs of 
aggression in men, rap songs like 
Jay Rock’s “WIN” feature lines like 
“Get out the way … f––k everything 
else … Win, win, win, win.” This 
triumphant and rebellious ethos 
captures the minds of young men 
and helps them direct their own 
aggression into musical energy 
and passion. Country can do the 
same. In Chris Stapleton’s “Outlaw 
State of Mind,” his lines “there’s 
people all across the land from 
New York out to old San Fran / just 
don’t give a damn all the time / in 
an outlaw state of mind,” embody 
the same rugged individualism 
intertwined with male rap, and 
offers a subway-commuting, nine-
to-five professional the catharsis of 
the cowboy romanticism that lies 
at the heart of so many Western 
stories.
So is the dislike for country 
music 
valid 
criticism 
or 
mainstream cultural elitism? Like 
any good debate, I think this is 
where nuance plays a role. Some 
dislike country because of its 
connection to past racism, others 
dislike it because it’s trendy to like 
Lil Wayne instead, and somewhere 
in 
the 
middle 
are 
everyday 
Americans trying to identify with 
real and enjoyable stories that 
artists tell through their music.
Perhaps 
country’s 
journey 
along the spectrum of popularity 
speaks to a greater attentiveness 
that Americans have for their 
neighbors who might have been 
raised a little differently in a far off 
part of the country. They might not 
have a lot of pickup trucks or front 
yard beer bashes in my native New 
York City, but that doesn’t mean I 
can’t sing along with a friend who 
finds a piece of home in a song on 
the radio.

A 

few nights ago I was 
eating dinner with a 
group of colleagues, and 
like most conversations these 
days, we ended up talking about 
politics. Specifically, someone at 
the table began a long rant, filled 
with sexist tropes and ignorant 
conclusions, about people who 
free bleed — bleed without 
using menstrual products like a 
pad, tampon or menstrual cup 
— during their period. In her 
chastisement, she said, “Radical 
feminists like those people ruin 
it for the rest of us.”
What a profoundly ignorant 
and misguided statement.
While 
there 
were 
many 

issues with what this person 
said, 
including 
misogynistic 
notions about female bodies 
and 
reproductive 
processes, 
the idea that radical feminists 
were somehow a hindrance 
to other feminists was deeply 
uninformed and quite frankly, 
ridiculous.
Yet, I was not surprised. 
During the mid-2010s, especially 
in the wake of the 2016 election, 
there has been a resurgence of 
feminism, sometimes referred 
to as “fourth wave feminism.” 
While feminism requires new 
feminists to join the cause in 
order to persist and thrive over 
time, it is imperative that new 
feminists familiarize themselves 
with 
feminist 
history 
and 
principles. However, in this new 
resurgence, many new and young 
feminists are perpetuating and 
popularizing a very shallow 
brand of feminism.
In 
We 
Were 
Feminists 
Once, Andi Zeisler, founder 
of Bitch Media, discusses the 
implications 
of 
marketplace 
feminism: where feminism is 
adopted by brands, which are 
often guilty of anti-feminist 
practices, to sell products as 
part of some sort of feminist 
lifestyle. 
In 
this 
way, 
21st 
century feminism has been, 
according to Zeisler, “co-opted, 
watered down, and turned into 
a gyratory media trend…[with] a 
media landscape brimming with 
the language of empowerment, 

but offering little in the way of 
transformational change.”
I have to agree. In fact, the 
idea of empowerment itself is 
foolish and ill-advised because 
it is based on the false idea that 
women are not leaning-in and 
seizing opportunities or power. 
When companies or policies 
claim to empower women, they 
fail to recognize the fact it is 
not actually women who aren’t 
asking for raises or saying no to 
inappropriate sexual advances, 
but systems of power that 
intentionally prevent women, 
particularly women with other 
marginalized identities, from 
gaining financial, political or 
social power in order to uphold 
patriarchal institutions. 
Especially on International 
Women’s Day or during the 
Women’s 
March, 
my 
social 
media feeds will be flooded with 
images of young women wearing 
pussy hats or something with 
a seemingly-feminist slogan or 
posts about girl power, women 
supporting women and so-called 
“sheroes.” Yet, it is the same 
people that post a selfie in a 
“Girls just want to have fun-
damental rights” T-shirt once a 
year whose claim to feminism is 
hollow and unproductive.
Of course, there have been 
feminist activists and academics 
doing hard and comprehensive 
work for years. I do not include 
them in groups that practice 
Frivolous Feminism, nor do 
I mean to be condescending 
towards young people new to 
feminism.
I certainly was not as socially 
or politically aware when I first 
claimed the feminist identity as I 
am now with women’s studies as 
one of my majors. And that’s OK. 
Becoming socially and politically 
aware is a learning process, one 
where we will make mistakes 
and learn from those mistakes.
But we cannot learn from our 
mistakes if we don’t know when 
we’ve made them or understand 
their implications. This is where 
the importance of criticism 
comes in. Critical thinking is at 
the root of feminism, precisely 

because 
feminism 
was, 
in 
part, borne out of critiques of 
patriarchal systems, like those 
that did not allow women to vote.
When 
the 
aforementioned 
person decried radical feminists, 
it was clear she lacked knowledge 
about feminism and its history. 
It is also clear she has not read 
feminist text or engaged with 
feminist theory on any serious 
level, if at all. But she is not alone.
Among 
many 
newly-
identifying feminists, there is 
often tone policing going on in 
order to make feminism more 
acceptable to other people (i.e. 
men). In trying to make it more 
agreeable, 
tone-policers 
are 
stripping feminism of its power 
to challenge and dismantle the 
systems of power and oppression 
that hurt and constrain women 
every day.

Radical 
feminists, 

particularly radical Black and 
lesbian feminists such as Audre 
Lorde or the writers of “The 
Combahee 
River 
Collective 
Statement,” have consistently 
been leading the feminist cause 
through progressive activism 
and contributing to fundamental 
feminist theory.
This is not about gatekeeping 
feminism 
by 
telling 
anyone 
they can or cannot identify as 
a feminist. It is about pointing 
out the problem with using 
feminism, especially when it is 
pseudo-feminism, as a tool to 
undermine and exclude other 
people.
A feminist awakening calls on 
us to examine the ways in which 
we benefit from and continue 
to uphold a white supremacist 
capitalist 
heteropatriarchy. 
Further, 
feminism 
requires 
work, 
including 
a 
personal 
divestment from systems of 
oppression. 
In the words of Black feminist 
Lutze B., “Feminism is not

Tonight is the highly anticipated premiere of “Game of Thrones” 
Season 8, which has been a great topic of conversation over the 
last few days (weeks, months). From a storytelling standpoint, 
“Game of Thrones” has become a stand-in example for a number 
of categories, perhaps the most common among them being brutal 
TV shows with merciless rates of character death.
“Game of Thrones” is unforgiving, and that’s something those 
of us who watch the show seem to love about it. All these recent 
conversations about season 8 have carried a similar trend of 
excitement that verges on betting: Who will live? Who will die? 
It’s gotten me thinking about why this is something we care about 
so much in fiction, and how many different forms death can take 
and roles it can fulfill in a fictional setting. Is character death a 
fun plot twist, or the exciting climax of an action-filled scene? Is 
it a beautiful send off to a beloved character? Is it grueling and 
horrifying? Is it cheap, or is it dark and serious, something meant 
to truly affect us on a deep emotional level and propel us to think 
about our lives?
The through-the-roof total of different deaths so far in “Game of 
Thrones” makes it the perfect case 
study for exploring these questions 
because really, death isn’t one of 
these things; it’s all, or any, of them. 
So, in the spirit of the season, here is 
a list of the wonderful possibilities 
of death in fiction, and why, in spite 
of their awfulness, they appeal so 
deeply to audiences and draw us 
back in again and again.
*Major Spoilers Ahead*
Plot Device:
This is by and large the biggest 
reason, and the one we probably 
care about the least. Did anyone 
really shed a tear when Robert 
Baratheon got attacked by that 
boar, or when Jojen Reed was killed 
by a wight in season 4? I only even 
remember those because I looked up 

a list of “Game of Thrones” deaths before writing this.
But they moved the plot forward, which was nice. If Robert 
hadn’t died, we never would have gotten to see his awful son 
Joffrey as king, and then where would we have been?
Advancing Another Character’s Development:
We all remember Khal Drogo, but from the beginning, he 
was clearly only there as one rung in Daenerys Targaryen’s long 
ladder to world domination. His death was an example of one less 
important character being offed in order to aid in the development 
of a much more significant character, by moving her along to the 
next stage of her journey.
“Game of Thrones” has a lot of examples of this — Shae is 
another one. Her’s is an interesting case compared to Drogo, in 
that their likeability progressed in opposite directions leading up 
to their deaths. Drogo started out as a complete villain, assaulting 
Daenerys in the first episode, but leading up to his death, the 
show took care to show the two of them bonding so that his 
eventual death felt like more of a personal sacrifice or milestone 
for Daenerys. Shae, on the other hand, was very sympathetic and 
likeable during her early relationship with Tyrion Lannister. The 
decision later to have her betray Tyrion later on feels like a primer 
to make her death more favorable and digestible, in addition to a 
spur motivating Tyrion to move on.

Keeping the Energy Up:
This might sound callous, but on the other hand, there’s a reason 
the Red Wedding is still one of the most talked-about events of 
the show, coming up on five seasons later. A big part of watching 
the show is exactly that: We like the excitement of tuning into 
an episode and not having any idea what to expect, knowing that 
anything could happen.
We Like Getting Our Hearts Broken:
Why else would Ygritte have to go like that? There’s no other 
explanation.
Genuine Emotional Consequences:
Death is really heavy. There’s no way around it, and it can’t 
always be a box to check off or a wild, out-of-nowhere thrill. One 
of the first genuinely memorable deaths was that of Ned Stark: It 
wasn’t the first death in the show, but it established the overarching 
precedent of “Game of Thrones” that no one is safe. It remains one 
of the show’s most powerful moments, and there was no fanfare, 
no extra or unnecessary drama. It was cold and surprising and 
relatively quiet. At its core, this is where the emotional investment 
of the show comes from: We see characters go through very real 
suffering and loss, like the rest of the Stark family, and we want to 
know that they’ll make it out of it at the end.
Of course, on the other hand, we also want to see the tables turn.
Sometimes Deaths Are Just 
Satisfying:
Joffrey Baratheon being poisoned 
at his wedding! Ramsay Bolton 
being eaten alive by his own dogs! 
Arya Stark killing Walder Frey, 
and later Littlefinger! It’s almost 
hard to remember a time when one 
character killing another by pouring 
hot gold over their head would have 
felt completely out of nowhere, 
but Viserys’s demise in season 1 
was only the first in a long line of 
characters who just plain needed to 
die. Sometimes that’s what we need 
out of fiction — when we sign on for 
all of its darkness and gruesome 
horror, we’re going in with the hope 
that eventually that darkness will 
work in our favor.

Why we love watching people die, according to ‘GoT’

A stage name is special. 
Oftentimes, 
it’s 
a 
unique 
representation of a creative 
identity that an artist feels 
his or her given name does not 
properly personify. While some 
pseudonyms 
are 
randomly 
generated 
nonsense 
(i.e. 
Childish Gambino), an analysis 
of many stage names can 
inform the art associated with 
them, helping us consumers 
further 
personalize 
the 
creations we consume. With 
this idea in mind, we’ve decided 
to take a dive into the world of 
fake names, exploring where 
they come from and what, if 
anything, they’re supposed to 
represent.
— 
Mike 
Watkins, 
Daily 
Music Editor
When people hear the term 
“stage name,” they typically 
think 
of 
pop 
superstars 
like Elton John, Drake or 
someone of similar acclaim. 
These figures chose their 
stage names so they could 

make 
themselves 
more 
recognizable, while also being 
simple enough for anyone 
to 
remember. 
However, 
in the black metal world, 
specifically in the infamous 
Norwegian scene in the 1980s, 
stage names serve an entirely 
different purpose.
In Norwegian black metal, 
stage names are chosen to 
advance a band’s aesthetic 
and 
sound. 
How 
could 
someone be in a band with a 
name like Darkthrone and 
be named Leif Nagell? They 
couldn’t be. To combat this 
issue, the members of these 
bands started to adopt stage 
names, 
some 
more 
over-
the-top than others. None, 
however, could beat Dead of 
the band Mayhem, not even 
his fellow bandmates, with 
names like Euronymous and 
Necrobutcher.
Sure, “Dead” isn’t the most 
creative name, but it fits the 
atmosphere and attitude of 
Mayhem so well. Dead’s story 
is complex and troubling, 
after all: He was allegedly 
announced to be dead for 
several minutes as a young 
boy, but his story is also 
easily researched. However, 

what needs to be explained 
is exactly why his name fit 
Mayhem’s music so well. Dead 
was the Mayhem’s frontman 
and lyricist. He wrote the 
lyrics 
for 
bone-crushing 
tracks like “Buried by Time 
and 
Dust” 
and 
“Freezing 
Moon,” in which Dead utters 
the 
scene-defining 
lines, 
“Everything here is so cold / 
Everything here is so dark.” 
Dead’s 
signature 
tortured, 
inhuman growl was also the 
defining voice in the entire 
Norwegian scene. No one 
else could replicate Dead’s 
sound, his lyrics, nor his 
stage presence. In fact, for 
many fans, Dead was black 
metal. His every move, from 
his on-stage self-harm to his 
use of “corpse paint,” was 
deployed by other bands. He 
wasn’t trying to be cool or 
pure. He was doing exactly 
what he felt he needed to 
do. Dead truly believed in 
Norway’s 
scene, 
and 
his 
suicide changed its course 
forever. Without him, there is 
no black metal, which is why 
Dead is the most important 
pseudonym in the genre.

Pseudonym Week: A look
at Mayhem & black metal

Is character death a fun plot twist, or the exciting climax of an action-filled 
scene? Is it a beautiful send-off to a beloved character?

If I had been told five years 
ago that Nike Air Force 1s 
would ever become too basic 
to purchase, I would have 
laughed in your face. How 
could oversized, clunky shoes 
that strayed a bit too much 
from the status quo ever 
become the new normal? 
I could not have been more 
wrong.
In the past half decade, 
and especially in the past 
year, Nike Air Forces (as 
well as their cousins, Adidas 
Superstars) 
have 
taken 
college campuses and the 
wallets of Generation Z by 
storm. Their utterly basic 
style is truly unlike any 
other shoe and yet that is its 
greatest appeal. The shoes fit 
absolutely anyone, regardless 
of gender identity or atheltic 
status — their versatility is 
unmatched.
How did people begin to 
see them this way as opposed 
to 
weird 
shoes 
that 
the 
hipsters wore at school? The 
answer lies in the effect of 
mob mentality.
In the ’80s, Nike Air Force 
1s achieved fame due to their 
widespread popularity among 
basketball players. Nike was 
the provider for basketball 
players 
both 
professional 
and amateur, and to promote 
their new shoe, they called 
upon the power of six stars of 
the time: basketball players 
Moses 
Malone, 
Michael 
Cooper, Jamaal Wilkes, Bobby 
Jones, Mychal Thompson and 
Calvin Natt. This marketing 

campaign was so iconic that 
it was emulated on the shoe’s 
25th anniversary in 2007 — 
with the more contemporary 
stars LeBron James, Steve 
Nash, Paul Pierce, Rasheed 
Wallace, Chris Paul and Kobe 
Bryant, among others. 
However, just as trends 
come and go, this one faded 
out in the next decade as new 
sneakers came out that could 
replace the old.
History 
in 
the 
fashion 
world has demonstrated this 
theme to us on countless 
occasions: Trends rise and 
fall. Though trends disappear, 
many of them make a return 
later on. Oftentimes, trends 
return about a decade later, 
causing people to forget the 
demographic group of which 
they originated from.
At 
the 
onset 
of 
their 
return, Air Force 1s were 
worn by people who wanted 
to stand out. This was largely 
due to the industry that 
reintroduced 
them 
— 
not 
basketball this time around, 
but rap music. Industry greats 
like Jay-Z and Fat Joe donned 
the shoe, and their rejection 
of what was “popular” at the 
time seeped down to their 
young fans. Diverging from 
the traditional sneaker of 
choice was a risky move that 
would 
instigate 
comments 
of 
shock 
and 
primarily 
judgement. 
Breaking 
the 
status quo was a risky move 
in high school unless one 
truly embodied the “I don’t 
give a fuck” persona.
It 
wasn’t 
until 
this 
headspace became something 
that people strove to embody, 
rather than a unique quality, 

that this aesthetic became 
basic — and, therefore, so did 
Air Force 1s.
The funny thing is that 
the 
people 
that 
brought 
Nike Air Force 1 sneakers 
back are no longer wearing 
them 
today. 
The 
areas 
where Nike Air Force 1s 
found 
their 
popularity 
— 
basketball and hip hop — are 
industries 
associated 
with 
and dominated by the Black 
community. This “trend” of 
Air Force 1s isn’t a trend at all, 
but rather another element 
of youth culture, alongside 
things 
like 
popular 
slang 
terms or musical methods, 
started by and stolen from 
the Black community. The 
trend started among Black 
artists and industry leaders, 
as adopted by Black teens and 
eventually was appropriated 
by white influencers and teens 
until the trend expanded and 
became accepted by a greater 
percentage 
of 
the 
young 
population until they became 
a staple.
Air Force 1s aren’t the 
only trend in on this theme. 
Oversized hoodies. Sneakers 
worn 
as 
formal 
wear. 
Scrunchies. The list goes on 
and on. They have always 
been around — it’s just that 
white people weren’t into 
them until recently.
Therefore, it is fair to make 
the case that the majority of 
recent trends are not new in 
actuality. They are merely 
revamps of clothing from 
another 
decade 
that 
has 
notably become of interest to 
a new demographic. Perhaps 
we should start giving credit 
where credit is truly due.

The rise and fall of trends

Some 
real-life 
stories 
are, 
simply put, too banal to be 
told on the screen. But in the 
utterly perplexing case of “The 
Hummingbird Project,” writer-
director Kim Nguyen 
(“War 
Witch”) 
delivers a completely 
fictional 
story 
that is more banal 
than reality itself. 
Everything 
about 
this mess of a nano-
financial engineering 
thriller 
begs 
the 
words “Based on real 
events” to appear on 
the screen at some 
point to justify its 
existence. 
(They 
don’t.) Not only is 
the film’s premise 
ludicrous in the way 
that many nonfiction 
film adaptations are, but the idea 
is so uncinematic and dry that I’m 
kind of impressed the movie was 
made in the first place.
“The Hummingbird Project” 
follows the story of two Wall Street 
schemers who hatch a ridiculous 
plan to shake up the entire system 
in the wake of the financial crisis. 
Vincent, 
a 
conniving 
hustler 
played by a typically neurotic Jesse 
Eisenberg (“Batman v Superman: 
Dawn of Justice”), teams up with 
his balding and blundering cousin, 
Anton (Alexander Skarsgård, “The 
Aftermath”) to make millions 
through a fiber-optic cable that 
connects from Kansas to New York 
City, allowing the pair to make 
financial trades a millisecond 
before other buyers.
This dense premise would 

be fascinating if it were even 
the slightest bit believable, but 
the truth is that Nguyen is a 
filmmaker, not an investment 
banking connoisseur, and it shows. 
His tendency to brush over and 
dart around the actual mechanics 
of his idea are detrimental to 
the film even to the most casual 

observer. You don’t need to be a 
financial wizard to know that the 
1000-mile line might not work, but 
you do need to be one to write a 
working screenplay about it. At one 
point, Anton attempts to explain 
the cable to a talkative waitress 
and instead of a concrete answer, 
he instead becomes fixated on — 
and, trust me, I couldn’t believe 
this either — lemon farmers in 
Zimbabwe.
Several of these unintentionally 
hilarious moments, times when 
the 
film’s 
zany 
momentum 
careened it off the tracks, at least 
kept me cracking up, if nothing 
else. Another of one of these I 
absolutely have to mention is 
a 
sweat-drenched 
Eisenberg 
wielding 
a 
chainsaw 
as 
he 
marches up a forest trail muttering 

to himself “I’m gonna fucking tear 
you down” with the intensity of a 
child whose birthday candles were 
blown out by someone else.
In essence, the film is too dull 
to be emotional and too shaky 
in its logic to be intellectual. 
The result is a genre-hopping 
compilation of half-baked scenes 
that don’t even sort 
of work. Sometimes, 
the movie aims for 
straight 
horror, 
with Salma Hayek’s 
(“The 
Hitman’s 
Bodyguard”) 
villain, Eva Torres, 
threatening 
the 
protagonists 
progress in wannabe 
Walter 
White 
fashion. 
At 
other 
times, the film plays 
out as a biopic of a 
nonexistent person, 
throwing 
equally 
nonexistent personal 
maladies at Vincent 
and Anton to thwart their efforts. 
“Hummingbird” even dabbles in 
sloppy social commentary a scene 
in which Amish farmers refuse to 
let the cousins dig their pipeline 
through “God’s land.”
Eisenberg’s 
performance 
is in every way an unbroken 
continuation 
of 
all 
of 
his 
performances thus far, as the 
brainy, detached genius who is 
too invested in his work to feel 
emotions. It’s almost as if Nguyen 
watched the actor’s excellent 
portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg 
in “The Social Network” and 
thought, “Hey, that guy could 
go to Wall Street!” Zuckerberg 
and Vincent are truly the same 
characters, and that makes the 
film entertaining even as it falls 
apart at the seams.

‘Hummingbird’ is a mess

I remember country music 
most vividly as the twangy 
acoustic stream trickling from 
the speakers of my Papaw’s 
truck. A good ol’ boy from 
Jellico, 
Tennessee, 
Papaw 
let the warmth of fiddles and 
guitars ramble quietly in the 
truck cab. Of course, 
he was doing donuts 
in the street with his 
grandchildren in the 
back, but the music 
was soft and simple. 
Needless to say, the 
days of my Papaw’s 
country music are long 
gone.
This 
truth 
was 
evident 
at 
last 
Sunday’s 54th Annual 
Association of Country 
Music 
Awards, 
hosted by the “Queen 
of 
Country,” 
Reba 
McEntire. 
McEntire 
was not terribly funny 
— as Kacey Musgraves’s 
perpetually 
cringing 
face confirmed — but 
her quip about women 
being frozen out of 
the Entertainer of the 
Year category is worthy 
of a smirk. The show 
got 
moving 
quickly. 
The 
night’s 
biggest 
winners were duo Dan 
+ Shay who won Song of the 
Year for “Tequila,” as well as 
Single of the Year and Duo 
of the Year. Other notable 
wins for the night included 
the brilliant Ashley McBryde 
winning New Female Artist 
of the Year, Musgraves’s well-
deserved win of both Female 
Artist of the Year and Album 
of the Year for Golden Hour, 
and Dierks Bentley’s win of 
Music Event of the Year for 
the Burning Man Tour.
As an awards ceremony that 
is sparse of categories, the 
show was dominated by some 
incredible 
performances. 
The extraordinary violinist, 
Amanda 
Shires, 
dazzled 
on the fiddle during Luke 
Comb’s 
performance 
of 
“Beautiful Crazy.” Likewise, 
the phenomenal alt-country 

darling, 
Brandi 
Carlile, 
stole 
the 
show 
during 
Bentley’s 
performance 
of 
“Travellin’ 
Light.” 
Other 
notable 
performances 
included Miranda Lambert’s 
powerhouse 
medley, 
“This 
Is Us” star Chrissy Metz’s 
performance of “I’m Standing 
With You” from her new film 
“Breakthrough,” as well as a 
heartwarming display in “Girl 

Goin’ Nowhere” by McBryde.
For 
all 
the 
striking 
performances 
and 
well-
deserved 
winners, 
there 
were a number of duds. The 
ceremony opened with “Can’t 
Hide 
Red,” 
performed 
by 
Florida 
Georgia 
Line 
and 
Jason Aldean, which could 
have 
simply 
flown 
under 
the radar, only if it was not 
also a shameless plug for Old 
Camp Whiskey, “the official 
whiskey of country music.” 
One can only hope that Old 
Camp doesn’t leave as bitter of 
a taste as the performance did.
The rapid fluctuation in 
tone throughout the night also 
contributed to the lackluster 
feeling. Like Luke Bryant’s 
“Knocking Boots” immediately 
following Miranda Lambert’s 
empowering 
performance 

of a medley of her greatest 
hits. Somehow Keith Urban 
won Entertainer of the Year, 
beating 
out 
compelling 
artists like Chris Stapleton. 
Equally 
confusing, 
Jason 
Aldean won the Dick Clark 
Artist of the Decade award. 
While 
he 
certainly 
has 
talent, few would consider 
Aldean 
more 
impressive 
than the innumerable female 
country 
artists 
who 
were ignored by the 
Academy.
While 
the 
ACM 
awards 
were 
entertaining to a point, 
the 
entire 
ceremony 
was 
tainted 
by 
the 
noticeable 
lack 
of 
female representation. 
Musgraves 
was 
not 
given 
a 
chance 
to 
perform 
and 
Shires 
was 
not 
announced 
when she played during 
Comb’s 
“Beautiful 
Crazy.” 
The 
entire 
show 
felt 
incredibly 
on edge, attempting to 
balance the discomfort 
with 
the 
increasing 
inability to ignore it. 
The fact that McEntire 
was willing to overtly 
call attention to it only 
proves how pressing 
the issue is. In fact, 
women were present 
on stage for awards 
only twice outside of 
female-oriented categories.
The 
ACM 
awards 
did 
have 
some 
outstanding 
performances. The bad ones 
certainly 
did 
not 
blemish 
the stunning talent that did 
manage to get time on stage. 
What 
became 
increasingly 
apparent 
is 
the 
Academy 
of 
Country 
Music’s 
very 
uncertain footing as it — and 
country music as a genre — 
struggle 
between 
tradition 
and the efforts of country’s 
more dynamic artists to break 
free of the Nashville sound. 
Evidently, that sound is not 
country music. Luckily, the 
outspoken 
frustration 
of 
female artists and increasing 
influence 
of 
roots-based 
artists 
at 
the 
ceremony 
demonstrated that there is 
clearly some light over yonder.

Awards

You don’t need to be a financial wizard to know that the 
1000-mile line might not work, but you do need to be one 
to write a working screenplay about it.

Last 
Sunday 
evening 
at 
the University of Michigan 
Museum 
of 
Art, 
I 
was 
transported to another world. 
Runyonland 
Productions, 
headed by School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance senior musical 
theater major Thomas Laub, 
put on a production of Adam 
Guettel’s “Myths and Hymns.”
The show itself is a song 
cycle 
focusing 
on 
various 
Greek myths like the Pegasus, 
Icarus and Hero and Leander. 
In addition to the show, the 
production showcased three 
men of Islamic, Judaic and 
Christian 
faith 
who 
spoke 
on their various experiences. 
The show as a whole focused 
on 
togetherness 
and 
the 
importance of breaking bread 
together. 
Once the show started, the 
audience was thrown into the 
world of fickle gods and insane 
beauty. The UMMA’s exquisite 
Apse, filled with grand columns 
and art from the emergence 
of 
Romanticism, 
furthered 
my suspension of disbelief. 
The performers also had the 
voices 
of 
gods 
themselves. 
Their marvelous voices echoed 
through the museum. During 
solo 
numbers, 
the 
sound 
was tragically beautiful. The 
casting of each solo number was 
brilliantly done. Each singer 
embodied the, at most times, 
tragic myth with simplicity and 
elegance that was only matched 
by the accompaniment of a lone 
piano, effortlessly played by 
SMTD professor Jason Dabord, 
who 
also 
music 
directed. 

Both sounds echoed up to the 
heavens and filled the space 
incredibly well considering no 
microphones were used. 
However, during the group 
numbers with a full band, it 
was difficult to make out the 
meaning and lyrics of the songs 
due to the unusual acoustics 
of the museum and competing 
sounds. “Myths and Hymns” 
was directed by SMTD faculty 
member Geoff Packard. In his 
director’s note, he stated that 
the message of the production 
was “of religious tolerance 
and understanding” through 
the lense of Guettel’s “lush” 
music and the “glorious halls 
of the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art.” Choreography 
by SMTD junior Mason Reeves 
was expertly curated to fill 
the 
unorthodox 
performing 
space. Although the format of 
the show was a song cycle, the 
dancing seemed to further fill 
out the production. At times, 
the movement doubled as a 
substitute for the nonexistent 
set. 
Adam Guettel is known for 
the complexity of his music 
both 
for 
instrumentalists 
and singers, neither of whom 
seemed to be struggling with 
the material. The piece ends 
with SMTD senior Matthew 
Edward Kemp exclaiming that 
he is the “fall of Pegasus, the 
fall of Icarus.” He is all of these 
myths — all things godly and 
mortal.
The end image was of the 
ensemble holding hands in 
solidarity. 
Throughout 
the 
production, there would be 
momentary breaks from the 
music to listen to the men 
representing various religions. 

At first, it was unclear as to 
their purpose in the production. 
Bassel Salka, a senior studying 
Industrial 
and 
Operations 
Engineering 
as 
well 
as 
a 
member of the Muslim Student 
Association Board, was the 
first to speak. He spoke on his 
experience as a Muslim man at 
the University. He was initially 
afraid due to the extensive 
hate speech about Muslims in 
his first years here, but more 
recently 
he 
remembered 
a 
time when students created 
a wall around him as a literal 
protective barrier, making him 
feel safe in the United States for 
one of the first times.
The second was rabbi Josh 
Whinston. In his speech, he 
urged listeners to treat each 
other well. We may never know 
why we were put on this earth, 
but all we can do for now is 
know how we’ve treated those 
around us. The last speaker 
was Episcopal minister and 
University 
alum 
Ian 
Reed 
Twiss. 
He 
spoke 
on 
how 
important it is to be “comfort 
food” for others. Even as it 
seems the world is descending 
into chaos, we must remember 
to eat and to feed each other. 
It is how we show love. It is 
the simplest form of showing 
another 
person 
that 
they 
matter. 
By the end of the production, 
I truly felt like I had been 
elevated by the art and wisdom 
surrounding our sometimes too 
independent and goal-driven 
world. Even the least religious 
of us could agree that the 
spiritual impact of this show 
was inspiring. Maybe we need 
each other much more than we 
realize.

M

ichigan football is 
back.
Well, sort of.
On Sat-
urday, the 
Wolverines 
held their 
Spring 
Game at 
Michi-
gan Sta-
dium, which 
turned out 
to be more 
of a practice 
with some 
scrimmage situations mixed in.
It was everyone’s last chance 
to see Michigan and all its 
offensive changes before the 
summer begins.
So, more accurately, Michi-
gan football 
was back for 
one day before 
going back into 
darkness where 
you can’t find it. 
Like Batman!
All jokes 
aside, it is 
very easy to 
watch Satur-
day’s action 
and immedi-
ately overreact, 
because it is the only glimpse 
of next season’s team that you 
will get until next season is 
here. And by that point, it’s 
far too late to change expecta-
tions.
Many people would say it’s 
smart to resist the urge to fire 
off the hottest takes imagin-
able, but I am not one of them. 
Now that we all got a taste of 
football, the next four-and-
a-half months without it are 
going to be hard, and there is 
no better way to pass that time 
than by envisioning, in mania-
cal detail, all the success your 
favorite team is going to have.
The fact that there is no 
real evidence to support your 
claims of supremacy means 
that there is also no evidence 

to prove you wrong!
Shea Patterson sure looked 
good on Saturday, didn’t he? 
The senior quarterback was 
slinging the ball all over the 
field. It didn’t seem to matter 
that some of his top receivers 
were out with injuries, because 
Patterson seized control and 
showed just how good he can 
be.
Patterson’s quotes after the 
game sounded confident, too. 
He pretty much completely dis-
pelled any concerns that offen-
sive coordinator Josh Gattis’ 
new offense will be accompa-
nied by a troublesome learning 
curve, and he even said this 
year is going to be fun. Fun is a 
good thing!
The rest of the offense was 
all roses, too.
Senior run-
ning back Tru 
Wilson is back 
and gritty as 
ever.
At this time 
last year, the 
offensive line 
was perhaps the 
biggest ques-
tion mark on the 
team, but now 
it just might be 
the surest unit the Wolverines 
have.
As for Gattis, he has changed 
the offensive philosophy. The 
tempo is up, with huddles a 
thing of the 
past. There are 
even cue cards 
on the sideline. 
We had cards 
for our offense 
my junior year 
of high school 
football, and 
we went 1-8. It 
wasn’t the signs’ 
fault. We just 
weren’t good. 
These signs are better, as is the 
talent on the field.
So, realistically, you should 
already be picking out which 

member of Michigan’s offense 
will win the Heisman and tell-
ing everyone you know.
Boom, there’s one side of the 
ball out of the way.
Now look to the defense.
I know my colleague Max 
Marcovitch 
wrote a column 
asking if the 
defense is going 
to be good liter-
ally yesterday, 
but I taught that 
kid everything 
he knows, so 
ignore him.
A lot of the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive talent 
from last year will be drafted 
later this month. That is a 
tough task to overcome. But 
Michigan does still have defen-

sive coordinator Don Brown.
Brown once hit me in the 
chest during a media availabil-
ity. I gave him permission first, 
but it was also crippling and 
sent the fear of God into my 
soul. From that moment on, I 
vowed not to bet 
against Brown.
Also, the Wol-
verines have 
overcome roster 
turnover before. 
In fact, they did 
it two years ago, 
becoming the No. 
1 defense in the 
country.
It isn’t as if all 
of last season’s 
talent is gone, either. Seniors 
Josh Metellus, Lavert Hill and 
Khaleke Hudson are returning 
to anchor the defense.

So what I’m saying is that 
you should be getting in the 
comments section for 2020 
mock drafts and asking why 
they are disrespecting Michi-
gan.
Of course, there is the pos-
sibility that you 
were disap-
pointed in the 
Spring Game 
for some rea-
son. In that 
case, you can 
just argue with 
everyone who 
was enthused 
by it.
I don’t say 
any of this 
for myself. I realize, and you 
probably do too, that the Wol-
verines will have to prove they 
belong on the field this fall. 

Expectations don’t really mat-
ter.
I say all of this for you, the 
fan, because the last paragraph 
may be true, but it is also your 
responsibility to ignore it.
So go and put yourself out 
there. Social media is too quiet 
and calm anyways.
The worst thing that can 
happen is that you look dumb 
online, but we all already look 
dumb online. Checkmate, 
buddy.
Besides, football won’t be 
back until August.
The least we can do is make 
the internet a little bit more 
like the gridiron.

SportsMonday Column: Time to overreact

T

here’s a reflexive ten-
dency in Michigan foot-
ball spheres to defer to 
Don Brown. It’s understand-
able, even justified.
In 
each of 
his three 
seasons at 
Michigan, 
Brown has 
guided 
a top-20 
defense 
nation-
ally. His 
defenses 
have 
given up 
less than 
2,000 passing yards per year 
each season; the last group 
to do that was the 2001-2003 
Miami Hurri-
canes (Yes, those 
Miami teams).
So when all 
else fluctuates — 
offensive strug-
gles, widespread 
coaching change, 
roster turnover 
— Don Brown 
remains, more 
than any other 
entity, the linch-
pin of the program. He annu-
ally coagulates whatever group 
of parts he has into a healthy 
sum. It’s why Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh called him the 
“king of defensive coordina-
tors” last year. And for many, it 
will be reason enough to sing 
kumbaya and expect a seam-
less defensive transition this 
year amid what, under any 
other circumstance, would be 
worthy of concern.
But while Brown’s presence 
may add a comfortable layer of 
trustworthiness, he does not 
make the defense impervious 
to questions — of which there 
are plenty to ask.
Not even the king of defen-
sive coordinators can step on 
the field and replace Devin 
Bush’s generational sideline-

to-sideline speed, Rashan 
Gary’s power or Chase Win-
ovich’s tenacity. He cannot 
mask a woefully thin interior 
defensive line, nor hide holes 
at safety and linebacker. 
The buzz within the team 
remains rightfully optimistic 
now, as if there’s reason for an 
alternative four months before 
the opening kickoff.
“We know that we’re looked 
down upon as a group out of 
the old defense to not do as 
well,” said senior linebacker 
Josh Uche. “That’s OK because 
that’s for us to prove to the 
world wrong.”
This is a team that is losing 
two top-10 NFL Draft picks, 
two other early-round selec-
tions and a multi-year starter 
and team captain at safety. 
It’s forced to 
replace three 
valuable inte-
rior defensive 
linemen — and 
currently 
looking to a 
250-pound 
converted 
fullback to 
slot into one 
of those roles 
(Yeah, yeah, I 
know how much you love Ben 
Mason).
This is especially trouble-
some given Brown’s biggest 
weakness has been his pro-
pensity to be 
too trusting of 
his players and 
scheme — to 
a fault. Ohio 
State last year, 
of course, is the 
classic example. 
In 2017, Penn 
State blitzed 
the Wolverines’ 
defense for 42 
points.
“It’s not the concept,” Brown 
said on Mar. 27, attempting 
to diagnose those problems. 
“What it is sometimes is, ‘My 
guys are better than their guys’ 

and I’m just gonna shove it.’ ”
Sure, recognition of this 
mindset inherently implies a 
desire to fix it. But this is not 
a group Brown 
will be able 
to take into 
big games and 
“shove it.”
None of this 
is meant to 
imply roster 
turnover is 
worrisome in a 
vacuum. Roster 
turnover is the 
norm at Michi-
gan and in college football — 
and nothing this coaching staff 
is unfamiliar with.
“I feel like stuff like this 
happens every year. My fresh-

man year, we’re losing all those 
guys and we only had one 
returner coming back,” said 
senior VIPER Khaleke Hudson 
“I feel like every 
year it’s going to 
be something — 
even next year, 
I’m going to be 
gone, so they’re 
going to be ask-
ing the next 
person the same 
question. Just 
do what you do 
regularly, just 
next person up 
step up and do what you’ve got 
to do.”
Many point to the 2016 off-
season — the one Hudson is 
referring to — as being similar, 

if not worse. The Wolverines 
lost 10 starters off a top-five 
defense in the country, includ-
ing Chris Wormley, Jabrill 
Peppers, Taco 
Charlton, Jour-
dan Lewis, 
Delano Hill and 
other stalwarts. 
The follow-
ing year, Gary, 
Bush, Winovich 
and other slot-
ted seamlessly 
into new roles.
The question 
of Michigan’s 
defense next year might hinge 
on whether they have a similar 
reservoir of talent waiting in 
the wings.
For now, amid a swarm of 

noise about Josh Gattis and the 
new-look offense, the defense 
can find its feet away from the 
spotlight.
“It’s different guys, but the 
same thing,” said redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Dylan 
McCaffery.
Perhaps, as has been the 
norm under Brown at Michi-
gan, that will hold true. Maybe 
the loss of Bush, Gary, Winov-
ich and others will hurt more 
than expected.
As with any potential spring 
takeaway 130 days before real 
snaps, only time will tell.

‘M’ shaky in series loss at Ohio State

This wasn’t how this weekend 
was supposed to go. 
The No. 24 Michigan baseball 
team 
came 
into 
Columbus 
confident. They’d won eight of 
their last ten games, including 
a two-game sweep of in-state 
rival Michigan State and a big 
weekend series win over a tough 
Minnesota team. According to 
Michigan coach, the Wolverines 
went into the series “fired up” 
to face an unranked, 18-16 Ohio 
State team and looking to stay 
hot.
What 
followed 
was 
unexpected. Michigan dropped 
the first two games of the 
series, 10-5 and then 10-4, with 
shaky performances from their 
usually-dominant Nos. 1 and 
2 starters, junior left-hander 
Tommy Henry and junior right-
hander Karl Kauffman. The 
Wolverines avoided a sweep in 
the second game of Saturday’s 
double 
header, 
beating 
the 
Buckeyes, 6-2.
“It 
was 
a 
disappointing 
weekend,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 
“We 
uncharacteristically didn’t pitch 
well, we were shaky at times 
defensively, we didn’t get the 
clutch hits when we needed to. 
“A rivalry series is very 
emotional. 
It 
has 
all 
the 
characteristics, all the look 
and feel of big-time baseball, 
whether 
your 
opponent 
is 
ranked or not. This had the 
environment and emotion of 
some of our bigger matchups of 
the season.”
Friday’s 
game 
stayed 
deadlocked through the first 
third 
of 
the 
contest. 
The 
Wolverines got on the board 
first as sophomore outfielder 
Jesse Franklin crushed the first 
pitch he saw for a solo home run 
to right-center, but the Buckeyes 
followed with runs of their own, 
scoring one each in the bottom 
of the first and third innings. 
Ohio State then broke the game 

open with three-run fourth and 
fifth innings. 
The 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
respond. Though they notched 
two runs in the seventh on a 
single from junior outfielder 
Jordan Brewer, and two more 
in the ninth on a two-out single 
from 
senior 
third-baseman 
Blake Nelson, but they could 
not build enough momentum to 
seriously contend for the game.
The first game Saturday was 
a similar story. The Buckeyes 
went on a tear over the first two-
thirds of the contest, racking 
up an 8-0 lead by the end of 
the third inning. Michigan put 
runs back on the board in the 
top of the sixth with a three-
run double from senior third 
baseman Jimmy Kerr and tacked 
on one more in the seventh on a 
solo home run for sophomore 
outfielder Jordan Nwogu, but 
like Friday’s game, the game 
was never in contention.
“We got outplayed the first 
two games,” Bakich said. “We 
have guys that have some really 
good weekends, and then have 
some 
really 
bad 
weekends. 
Instead of having the extremes 
of the highs and the lows, 
baseball is about consistency.”
Saturday’s second game was 
a bright spot for the Wolverines, 
though. 
Sophomore 
right-
hander 
Jeff 
Criswell 
gave 
Michigan what it needed with 
a dominant 6.2 innings of work 
over which didn’t allow a single 

earned run. The offense finally 
regained its rhythm Saturday. 
redshirt senior outfielder Miles 
Lewis notched two RBI in the 
game with a grounder to score 
Nwogu in the sixth and a double 
to plate Franklin in the seventh. 
Junior 
outfielder 
Dominic 
Clementi, 
Franklin, 
senior 
second baseman Ako Thomas, 
and Kerr all also earned RBI on 
the day.
Overall, though it was a 
disappointing 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 
still 
have 
high 
expectations for the rest of their 
season, and as their schedule 
grows a little less demanding 
over the rest of the season — 
after 
Wednesday’s 
midweek 
tilt 
against 
Bowling 
Green, 
Michigan doesn’t have another 
midweek game until May 8 
against Eastern Michigan — 
they’ll have more time to iron 
out their issues before the 
season wraps up. 
“So far this season, we have 
not played our best baseball yet,” 
Bakich said. “We need to just 
continue to trend upwards, and 
when we have setbacks like this, 
to use it as growth, to use it as 
fuel to better our performance 
in the future. 
“If we’re going to be the team 
that we think we can be, then 
we’re going to have to play well 
when it means the most, and a 
rivalry series is certainly one of 
those weekends that means the 
most.”

Softball splits series in Columbus

Katie Alexander hadn’t hit a 
home run in 14 games. But this 
weekend in Columbus, she knocked 
two. And in one game.
Following the senior catcher’s 
lead, the No. 21 Michigan softball 
team went 2-1 in three games 
against 
Ohio 
State, 
winning, 
10-3 and 6-2, before dropping 
the weekend’s final game, 2-1. 
Even with the loss Sunday, which 
snapped the Wolverines’ 15-game 
win streak, the two comeback wins 
marked a shift in power at the plate, 
a welcome sign for Michigan’s 
offense, which at times has lacked 
in run generation.
After an RBI single in the third 
inning that gave the Buckeyes the 
first run of the weekend, Michigan 
didn’t regress from the setback like 
in many earlier games this season. 
Instead, it thrived on the hardship.
In the fourth inning, junior 
third baseman Madison Uden hit a 
groundout to Ohio State shortstop 
Lilli Piper that drove in freshman 
outfielder Lexie Blair to tie the 
game.
The run began a surge of power 
for the Wolverines.
In the same inning, junior 
outfielder Haley Hoogenraad hit a 
triple to right field for an RBI and 

Alexander slammed her first home 
run to right field for two RBI.
“I was just really seeing the 
ball really well that night and was 
confident,” Alexander said. “We 
felt really good.”
After Buckeye catcher Claire 
Nicholson homered to left field and 
senior first baseman Alex Sobczak 
hit a sacrifice flyout for an RBI to 
increase the score to 5-3, Alexander 
hit her second blast for a home run. 
Hoogenraad furthered the power 
and finished the game with a grand 
slam to left field.
“(Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins) always goes by me and 
says, ‘Try less hard and really 
trust what you can do’ and I think 
that’s really a huge thing that helps 
me,” Hoogenraad said. “I think 
(today) was just a huge burst of 
confidence.”
The next game continued that 
assertiveness at the plate. Down 
2-0 heading into the second inning, 
Hoogenraad 
and 
Alexander 
continued to lead the lineup, 
delivering an RBI single apiece. 
Aside from a home run by Sobczak 
in the third inning, other scoring 
resulted from RBI singles as well, 
as the Wolverines won 6-2.
Even with lackluster starts, 
Hutchins sees the wins as strong 
performances for the Wolverines, 

with players in both the top and 
bottom of the lineup producing 
offensively.
“They just connected on pitches 
on time, and that’s what we’re 
always striving for,” Hutchins 
said. “We really needed the sixth 
through ninth players to pick up 
their production, and they did an 
outstanding job.”
Hutchins 
maintained 
that 
attitude even in Sunday’s 2-1, 
eight-inning loss. Up 1-0 off a walk 
that forced a run, sophomore left-
hander Meghan Beaubien allowed 
a home run in the seventh inning 
that tied the game, then a walk-off 
single that won the game for Ohio 
State. Despite the slip-up in the 
last two innings, Beaubien’s shut 
out performance in the first six 
innings still signified a strong day 
in Hutchins’ eyes.
“Meghan threw 12 shutout 
innings against a really big hitting 
team, and they got a piece of her 
in the seventh inning. … I told her 
our offense didn’t do its part today. 
Our pitching did its part,” Hutchins 
said. “We were behind in both of 
our victories and we didn’t let it 
shake us and rattle us and we just 
fought back. I think our kids can’t 
complain. To win we had to fight. 
And I thought we fought really 
hard.”

Michigan blanks Maryland, 5-0, 
claims outright Big Ten Title

Champions keep playing until 
they get it right.
The quote may have come 
from tennis legend Billie Jean 
King, and the Michigan women’s 
tennis 
team 
has 
embodied 
it through and through this 
season.
All the way to an outright Big 
Ten title. 
Despite a 4-3 loss to Florida 
in Gainesville on Thursday, the 
Wolverines (15-5 overall, 11-0 
Big Ten) rallied to come away 
with two straight shutouts in 
New Brunswick and College 
Park to add another piece of 
hardware to the trophy case. 
Saturday, Michigan blanked 
Rutgers (9-9, 1-7), 5-0, with 
dominant play from doubles 
pairs No. 1, seniors Kate Fahey 
and Brienne Minor, and No. 
2, junior Giulia Pairone and 
freshman Anca Craciun, who 
have acted as doubles-point 
closers throughout the season. 
Along 
with 
strong 
doubles 
play were convincing singles 
victories from Fahey, Minor 
and sophomore Alyvia Jones to 
clinch the win. 
With 
the 
postseason 
approaching, 
the 
Wolverines 
made some changes to the 
matchups to assure the absolute 
best scenario going into the 
clinching meet.
The No. 3 doubles spot has 
fluctuated all season, usually 
occupied by Jones and either 
junior Chiara Lommer or fellow 
sophomore 
Bella 
Lorenzini. 
Occasionally, a win will come 
from No. 3, but the pair, whoever 
it may be, has a losing record this 
season. 
However, on Sunday, it all 
finally clicked. And what better 
of a time than the last match of 
the regular season?
Jones was paired up with 
junior Lera Patiuk and played 
some of their best tennis this 
season. Mirroring the No. 2 
doubles win secured just before 
their 
own 
by 
Pairone 
and 

Craciun, Jones and Patiuk beat 
their opposing Maryland (3-16 
overall, 1-8 Big Ten) duo, 6-2.
“We just work really well as 
a team,” Jones said of her new 
doubles partner. “We had really 
good energy, and we both ended 
up playing pretty well, so that 
helps on the court.”
Added Pairone: “I think we’re 
improving so much in doubles. 
As the season went on, we’ve 
been playing so much better. And 
I think we’re really helping each 
other out like we’re supposed to. 
So it’s really good to get that first 
point and it’s helping a lot when 
we get into singles.”
The Wolverines’ performance 
in singles play was just as 
impressive. Pairone was the 
first to score a singles point 
for Michigan, defeating her 
opponent, 6-1, 6-0. Fahey and 
Jones soon followed suit, coming 
away with victories of 6-2, 6-1 
and 6-0, 6-1, respectively. Minor 
slammed it home, 6-4, 6-1, and 
gave the Wolverines their final 
point and their conference title. 
“It’s a long season of Big 
Tens, a lot of good teams,” 
said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. 
“I’m 
just 
happy 
for the girls, especially this 
weekend — you know, they 
took care of business. Today we 
actually played really well. So, 
I’m just proud of them, happy 
for them. To go undefeated in 
this conference isn’t easy, so it 
definitely feels good.”
In contrast to last season, 

when they won the Big Ten 
Tournament 
as 
the 
clear 
underdog, the Wolverines have 
shown they are a force to be 
reckoned with. 
“We’re just looking for that 
balance, and that we can count 
on everybody,” Bernstein said. 
“So, if we ever get to that, I don’t 
know that we’ve been that yet 
this year – you know, all three 
doubles teams clicking and all 
six singles players at the same 
time. If we have that, if we can 
get to that place, we’re pretty 
tough to beat.
“But I think as far as all of 
us, if I look down the line, I 
think everyone is feeling pretty 
confident, which is where you 
want to be at the end of the year. 
I think we’re peaking.”
This season wasn’t always 
pretty and the team has seen 
its fair share of ups and downs, 
but with the Big Ten and NCAA 
tournaments 
approaching, 
Michigan, 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Champions, needs to follow 
King’s advice: to keep playing 
until they get it all right. 
“We’re 
really 
playing 
as a team, and not just as 
individuals,” 
Pairone 
said. 
“And I think just going into the 
tournament, we’re feeling really 
confident, and we know we can 
do very well. But we also know 
that we have to keep working 
and 
make 
sure 
that 
we’re 
getting better. Feeling like we’re 
champions doesn’t stop us from 
continuing to work hard.”

In loss, Curran nets 100th point

With 8:41 remaining in the 
third quarter against No. 1 
Penn State (10-1 overall, 3-0 
Big Ten) on Saturday, Michigan 
freshman attacker Bryce Clay 
found senior midfielder Decker 
Curran wide open on a cross-
crease pass. Curran wound up 
and fired a bullet past Nittany 
Lions goalkeeper Colby Kneese, 
cutting the Wolverines’ deficit 
to three.
With 
the 
goal, 
Curran 
netted his 100th career point, 
becoming 
only 
the 
fourth 
player in Michigan history to 
achieve the feat.
“It’s cool,” Curran said. “I 
actually didn’t know I was 
there until it came up on the 
loudspeaker, but it’s obviously a 
huge accomplishment.”
For Michigan (3-8, 0-3), the 
moment was a bright spot on an 
afternoon where offense was 
hard to come by. Penn State 
would score seven unanswered 
goals after Curran’s goal en 
route to a 17-7 throttling of the 
Wolverines.
“(The 
result) 
100 
percent 
(diminishes 
the 
accomplishment),” Curran said. 

“That’s definitely not a way the 
boys want to end in the fourth 
quarter, you know, a ten goal 
deficit. The accomplishment 
doesn’t really mean anything if 
the boys aren’t winning.”
Though the season has so 
far been a disappointment for 
Michigan — the Wolverines 
have 
not 
yet 
won a Big Ten 
game 
— 
the 
strong play of 
Curran and his 
fellow 
seniors 
can 
act 
as 
a 
building 
block 
for the future 
of 
the 
young 
program. 
For 
the 12 freshmen 
on 
the 
team, 
Curran’s body of 
work acts as an example of how 
extra effort can pay dividends 
in the future.
“(He’s) someone to look up 
to,” said Michigan coach Kevin 
Conry. “He puts a lot of time in 
off the field, a lot of extra shots, 
so it’s good to see that point 
production kind of kick in. … 
Whenever we can, we look for 
guys who can be a good example 
to guys like (freshmen) Bryce 
Clay and Javon Johnson.”

Curran’s effort on Saturday 
is just another in a long string 
of impressive performances for 
the senior leader. His 27 points 
on the season put him fourth on 
the team, with his 17 goals and 
10 assists placing him fourth 
and third, respectively.
This positive example for 
the 
team’s 
freshmen 
has 
already 
begun 
to pay off in 
small ways. Clay 
buried a goal of 
his own in the 
second quarter 
in addition to 
his 
assist 
on 
Curran’s 
goal, 
and 
Johnson 
added 
a 
key 
goal early in the 
third, while the game was still 
in contention.
“I have a feeling I won’t be 
up there (as one of Michigan’s 
leading scorers) for very long,” 
Curran said. “But it’s pretty 
cool, seeing that, knowing that 
all that hard work has definitely 
paid off a bit.”
“Every time you have a 
senior,” added Conry, “you 
expect something of his legacy 
to kind of live on.”

During spring ball, injuries lead to new opportunities for freshmen

Mike Sainristil got the ball on 
a crossing route at the 23-yard 
line, beat his defender and 
coasted into the end zone.
It was the first drive of 
Michigan’s Spring Game on 
Saturday, and though there was 
no real scoring, it wasn’t lost on 
the crowd that the freshman 
wide receiver had scored the 
opening touchdown — well, 
insofar as there are touchdowns 
in a no-tackle scrimmage.
Sainristil is supposed to still 
be in high school now, preparing 
for exams, going to prom and 
planning graduation escapades. 
Instead, he early-enrolled and 
joined the Michigan football 
team. There, he was thrust into 
a role bigger than he could have 
imagined.
Under 
new 
offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis, spring 

ball was supposed to feature a 
heavy dosage of the Wolverines’ 
three top receivers — junior 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Tarik 
Black and junior Nico Collins. 
But Black is the only one of 
those that’s been 
healthy. With the 
other two out, it 
gave 
Sainristil 
a 
chance 
to 
get 
reps 
with 
the 
first-team 
offense 
— 
an 
opportunity 
he 
wouldn’t 
have 
had otherwise.
There, 
he’s 
dazzled, earning 
praise from players and coaches 
alike as the freshman that’s 
stood out the most. Though the 
spring game itself means very 
little, the experience players 
like Sainristil have gained has a 
much greater significance.

“For a lot of people to come 
out and get their spot, come out 
there and show everybody on 
offense … and show everybody 
what they can do,” said senior 
defensive tackle Carlo Kemp. 
“And it’s been a lot of fun seeing 
how many guys 
have been able 
to come and get 
that 
play 
just 
because it’s been 
unfortunate 
with how many 
people have been 
hurt.”
As 
for 
the 
injured 
players 
themselves, 
they’ve 
stayed 
involved in other ways. In 
between rehab sessions, they 
feature heavily in meetings with 
their respective position groups, 
learning the playbook, keeping 
the energy up and encouraging 
camaraderie.
In the running back room, for 
instance, there’s a full layout 
of 
the 
field 
where 
they 
draw up plays 
for simulation. 
Injured 
veterans 
can 
still take part 
and 
impart 
their 
wisdom 
on 
the 
new 
crop of players 
coming up.
“(Running 
backs coach Jay Harbaugh) 
preaches mental reps a lot,” 
said senior running back Tru 
Wilson. “And they’re really, 
they’ve gotta hold the ball on 
the sidelines, they gotta see the 
call from the side, they gotta go 
through the play like they’re in. 
So it’s helpful for them because 
everybody 
knows 
the 
play, 
everybody’s getting work in on 
every play.”
And when the young players 
do take the field in place of an 
injured starter, those veterans 
have the opportunity to pull 
them aside and act almost as a 
second coach, telling them what 
to work on or what to do when 
they see certain formations, 
encouraging them and learning 
what they’re capable of.
Senior 
defensive 
tackle 

Michael Dwumfour, out with 
a 
torn 
plantar 
fascia, 
has 
especially 
taken 
that to heart. He’s 
aided 
freshman 
defensive 
tackle 
Mazi 
Smith 
on 
and off the field 
and 
helped 
the 
entire 
defensive 
line learn their 
roles.
“(Dwumfour’s) 
done it with all of 
us,” said redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 
Donovan Jeter. “Mike’s been 
in every big game. Ohio State, 
Penn State, Michigan State, 
Notre Dame, he’s been in all 
the big games, so if he’s telling 
you 
something, 
he’s telling you 
something 
from 
experience.”
Defensive line 
and wide receiver 
are two of the 
positions 
with 
the biggest depth 
concerns. 
So 
while the rash of 
injuries at those 
two 
positions 
are in one way a bad sign for 
the Wolverines, those injuries 
have at the same time given 
reps to players who may not 

have gotten them otherwise. 
That helps build up a steady 
stream of backups waiting in 
the wings should one of those 
players go down. Spring camp is 
a big step up from high school, 
giving those players valuable 
development time.
“Adapting real fast to spring 
ball, the practices are longer, 
everything’s 
longer,” 
said 
redshirt sophomore offensive 
tackle Andrew Stueber. “So it’s 
kind of more brutal. And if you 
get through that, then practices 
in the fall and the camps, it’s 
shorter, and you’re kind of used 
to how the play goes and how 
the practice goes.”
And with Black, Peoples-
Jones 
and 
Dwumfour 
all 
expected 
back 
for the start of 
the season, the 
young 
players 
will face tough 
competition in 
fall camp.
Then, 
when 
they 
get 
the 
chance 
to 
step 
into 
the 
spotlight 
— 
whether 
in a year or two when their 
predecessors 
graduate, 
or 
because of an injury — they’ll be 
ready to shine.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Freshman wide receiver Mike Sainristil has impressed in spring camp with Nico Collins and Donovan Peoples-Jones out.

(Jay Harbaugh) 
preaches 
mental reps a 
lot.

Mike 
(Dwumfour’s) 
been in every 
big game.

The practices 
are longer, 
everything’s 
longer.

Moments before the start of 
Michigan’s spring game Saturday 
afternoon, a plane flew over 
Michigan Stadium. Behind it flew a 
sign reading, ‘Hey Jim, this is God. 
It’s OK to pass on first down. Let’s 
try it.’
An 
hour 
later, 
when 
the 
Wolverines lined up for their 
first 11-on-11 play of the day, Shea 
Patterson took the snap, sprinted 
to his right and pitched to senior 
running back Tru Wilson. Then 
came a jet sweep to freshman wide 
receiver Mike Sainristil before a 
zone run up the middle. Only on 
the fourth play from scrimmage 
did Patterson finally drop back and 
fire off his first pass of the day — 
one that went for a 15-yard gain to 
sophomore wide receiver Ronnie 
Bell.
The pre-game plane carried the 
optimistic hope for change that 
has defined Michigan’s offseason 
since it hired Josh Gattis as its 
new offensive coordinator on Jan. 
10. And while aspects of that hope 
may be rooted in reality, Saturday’s 
spring game was a reminder that 
the Wolverines’ running game isn’t 
going anywhere.
“Gattis came in and did a great 
job adapting his own mindset 
and the offense,” said redshirt 
sophomore right tackle Andrew 
Stueber. “But he was very specific 
to say, it’s not his style, it’s our style 
as a team. So he’s not coming in 
playing strictly his own style, he’s 
kinda changing it to the whole 
team adapting their style. What 
worked last year will continue to 
work and what he can bring to the 
table, he will.”
But 
Saturday 
was 
also 
a 
reminder that this running game 
is different. For every remnant of 
the old — think redshirt freshman 
running 
back 
Julian 
Garrett 
getting stuffed on a third-and-goal 
carry up the middle — there were a 
handful of signs of the new.
Those first two plays of the 

game, a read option with Patterson 
and a jet sweep to one of the 
Wolverines’ 
fastest 
receivers, 
weren’t non-existent a year ago. But 
they wouldn’t have been Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh’s first two 
plays of any game, scrimmage or 
otherwise.
“We see a lot more long 
zone, a lot more stretches,” said 
sophomore 
defensive 
lineman 
Aidan Hutchinson. “It looks like 
he’s trying to stretch the field out 
and that’s what I’ve seen when I’ve 
gone against the offense.”
The 
available 
personnel 
certainly lends credence to hopes 
of a shift toward a pass-first 
offense. Karan Higdon and his 224 
carries are off to the NFL, Chris 
Evans and O’Maury Samuels are 
no longer with the program and 
sophomore Christian Turner and 
early enrollee Zach Charbonnet 
have spent the spring injured, going 
through plays on a layout of a field 
that Michigan has in its running 
backs room.
But instead, the focus has 
merely shifted onto Wilson — the 
only running back who played last 
year to feature on Saturday — and 
the inexperienced underclassmen 

behind him. “I’m just building 
confidence,” Wilson said. “Just 
trying to be a leader more for some 
of the younger guys in the room 
and just be able to make plays, play 
fast. … But I’m really enjoying it, 
I’m really enjoying the style of play 
we’re in.”
And that — the style of play 
— is the key. Five months out 
from kickoff, it doesn’t matter 
that the personnel isn’t there yet. 
Charbonnet will inevitably be 
a major part of the offense and 
Turner likely will too.
For now, what matters is that 
Michigan’s offense is still going 
to run the ball. And when it does, 
it’s going to be a whole lot more 
exciting than it has in the past.
All you need to do to find that out 
that is ask the one defense who’s 
faced it:
“I’m tired of them going hurry 
up. It’s annoying,” said redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive 
lineman 
Donovan Jeter.
“… It’s a blessing and a curse 
cause there’s days when you’re 
dead tired but it’s gonna be like 
that on Saturdays. So I’m glad our 
offense has just changed the way 
they do everything.”

Shea Patterson was buried 
in the corner when Donovan 
Jeter’s turn came to answer 
questions.
Michigan’s spring game was 
still going on, and about 100 
yards up the tunnel, Patterson 
was standing in a room off to 
the side wearing a tank top and 
a cap turned backwards, the 
reins at quarterback turned 
over to early enrollee Cade 
McNamara.
Jeter looked over at the 
senior quarterback, or what 
he could see of him behind a 
scrum of reporters that reached 
four deep.
“They got Shea,” Jeter said, 
loud enough to hear over the 
clamoring. “They ain’t worried 
about me.”
And, well, he wasn’t wrong.
A few weeks ago, offensive 
line coach Ed Warinner called 
Josh Gattis’ offense, “tailor-
made” for Patterson — and on 
the first drive of the spring 
game, Patterson hit Ronnie Bell 
on a crossing route, then Mike 

Sainristil for a touchdown, both 
balls thrown exactly where 
they needed to be.
Spring games are inherently 
farcical, 
even 
without 
the 
added stipulations Michigan 
football puts onto them. Trying 
to extrapolate anything from 
a scrimmage is hard. Trying 
to extrapolate anything from 
a handful of drills with some 
non-tackling scrimmage snaps 
tacked onto the end is fool’s 
work.
Later though, with the pocket 
collapsing, Patterson stepped 
up, saw Oliver 
Martin 
alone 
near the end 
zone. 
Another 
dart. That play 
got blown dead 
on an artificial 
sack, 
and 
it 
was in a setting 
that 
shouldn’t 
matter. But, of 
course, it does.
Last 
year, 
Jim Harbaugh’s offense hit a 
wall. Good. Not good enough 
— especially when it counted. 
The 
Wolverines 
shredded 
Wisconsin and Penn State. 
They fell short at Ohio State 
and did next to nothing against 
Florida.
Whether or not this offense is 
where Patterson will thrive is a 
question that will be answered 
in November and December. To 
hear him tell it, there already 
seems to be a conclusion.
“It’s just, it feels natural,” 
Patterson said. “… I think the 
game’s slowed down a little bit.”
This offense, at least for now, 
lived up to all the hype built in 
the form of pent-up frustration. 
Michigan went fast. Michigan 
didn’t huddle. Michigan ran 
shotgun. Michigan ran speed 
options and RPOs. Michigan 
seemed to click on all cylinders, 
doing something completely 
different than it has in the 
duration of Harbaugh’s time in 

Ann Arbor.
So, 
when 
Patterson 
was 
asked about the truthfulness of 
Warinner’s description, it really 
wasn’t all too surprising when 
he gave a one-word answer.
“Yeah.”
As Patterson pointed out, 
Gattis is the sixth offensive 
coordinator to coach him in the 
last six years. He ran something 
similar at Ole Miss, but at this 
point, he’s used to learning 
something 
different 
every 
spring.
“(Patterson) looked pretty 
comfortable 
today,” 
said 
senior tight end 
Sean 
McKeon. 
“He’s 
been 
licking his chops 
all spring with 
this 
offense. 
Just getting new 
stuff right now. 
He said it was 
pretty similar to 
some stuff he did 
at Ole Miss, so he was already 
pretty used to most of the stuff 
we ran.”
Gattis’ system makes things 
simple for everyone else, but 
the quarterback needs to do 
a little more compared to last 
year. There’s more reading 
the 
defense 
— 
on 
RPOs, 
Patterson needs to pick out the 
option player, often based on 
alignment, then figure out what 
he’s doing. He’s required to 
know the protections, the runs, 
the running back’s footwork, 
the receivers’ routes.
Harbaugh’s 
offense 
was 
complicated, 
too, 
albeit 
in 
a completely different way. 
Everyone had to think about 
everything, all the time, which 
meant things could get too slow 
and too complex. This, at least 
for now, is different.
“It’s night and day,” Patterson 
said. “… As far as similarities, I 
think there’s very few.
“It’s gonna be fun.”
