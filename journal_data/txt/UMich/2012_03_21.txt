syste-m effective in stor-m

Though the 2012 Michigan
football schedule features 2
fewer homes games than last
year, students will be paying
more to attend each game this
season for the second straight
year.
Season tickets for students
will cost $195 for six home
games, or $32.50 per game,
with an additional $10 service
fee - up from $250 for eight
homes games, or $31.25 per
game in 2011.
Hunter Lochmann, aenior
associaterathletic director and
the Athletic Department's
chief marketing officer, said
the price increase is necessary
for the Athletic Department
to maintain competitive and
match the price level of other
institutions.
"We realize that we are
a little underpriced in some
areas, and this (raise in ticket
prices) gets us a little closer
to that price (of peer institu-
tions)," Lochmann said.
Lochmann added that

E-mails, phone calls
and text messages
warned of inclement
weather on campus
By CHARLENE LERNER
Daily StaffReporter
While emergency sirens blast-
ed throughout Ann Arbor last
Thursday amid hail and lightning
to warn locals of a fast-approach-

ing tornado, the University used
its own system to caution campus
of an impending emergency.
The University's Emergency
Alert system, implemented in
February 2008 by the Univer-
sity's Department of Public Safe-
ty, has bridged the gap between
mass-warning signaling and the
lack of informative details. On
Thursday, the system sent e-mails
to all University students, fac-
ulty and staff. Text and voicemail
messages were also sent to those
who registered for the additional

notification service.
The system is the most reliable
communication system in send-
ing direct information to the Uni-
versity community, according to
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown.
"With the emergency alert,
you can send a text message,
voice message and an e-mail mes-
sage so that people can get more
information than they would get
from a non-worded siren," Brown
said.
Though all students, faculty

Notre Dame charges $38 per
game for student tickets and
Ohio State charges $32.
Including the service fee,
student season ticket prices
amount to $2.50 more per
ticket for the 2012 season, and
the team will play only six
games at home instead of the
eight played this past season.
Michigan is scheduled to
play Air Force, Massachu-
setts, Illinois, Michigan State,
Northwestern and Iowa at
home this season.
Marquee games against
Alabama, Notre Dame,
Nebraska and Ohio State will
all be played away from the
Big House this fall.
Lochmann said one reason
prices were raised was to give
students an incentive to arrive

Year
at the stadium prior to kick-
off and not waste their well-
spent money.
"We want more students
who buy their student tick-
ets to come (to home games).
We want them to attend, we
want them to get there early,"
Lochmann said. "So by rais-
ing these prices minimally,
we're definitely not trying to
price anybody out. We want
students to show up early, it's
such a huge home advantage
when they're there early and
loud."
LSA sophomore Kate
Maknev said she does not
think the increase in prices
will impact student atten-
dance.

"The enthusiasm and the ener-

Soetoro-Ng visit
honors Asian-
Pacific American
Heritage month
By SYDNEY BERGER
Daily StaffReporter
In January, President Barack
Obama visited the University,
emphasizing the importance
of college affordability and
accessibility during his address
at Al Glick Field House. This
Thursday, his half-sister Maya
Soetoro-Ng will be addressing
campus as part of the Universi-

ty's celebration of Asian-Pacific
American Heritage Month.
The University's Asian/
Pacific Islander American Stud-
ies program will be hosting
Soetoro-Ng for a lecture titled
"Education for Peace and Global
Awareness." The lecture will be
delivered at the Michigan Union
and will come in preparation for
Asian-Pacific American Heri-
tage Month, which will be cele-
brated in May. Soetoro-Ng is an
assistant professor of education
at the University of Hawaii -
Manoa and a published author.
"We are extremely honored
tohave her," saidAssociate Prof.
Scott Kurashige, director of the
Asian/Pacific Islander Ameri-

can Studies program. "She is a
very distinguished scholar."
The month of May was offi-
cially designated Asian-Pacific
American Heritage Month in
1992, and it was chosen as the
celebratory month because Jap-
anese immigrants first arrived
in the United States on May 7,
1843, according to a website
dedicated to the month.
Kurashige said there is a need
for greater awareness of Asian/
Pacific Islander American stud-
ies on campus to provide a
new perspective on issues like
gender, sexuality, history and
immigration.
"It's an important time
where people learn about the

significance of Asian American
and Pacific Islander history
and some of the important con-
temporary issues facing Asian
American/Pacific Islander
communities on campus and off
campus," Kurashige said.
Soetoro-Ng has made a large
impact in promoting intercul-
tural awareness through her
advocacy work, in which she
connects her domestic under-
standing of diversity with global
awareness.
"She is well known for
her political activism and for
her writings on education,"
Kurashige said. "Even though
her own work hasn't focused

After years of University
students merely limiting
community service work to
volunteer days in Detroit, stu-
dents in the Michigan Com-
munity Scholars Program
residential learning commu-
nity formed the Brightmoor
Youth Garden Partnership,
an organization that aims to
develop long-term partner-
ships with Detroit's Bright-
moor community.
LSA junior Sandhya
Kajeepeta, a BYGP executive
hoard member, said Bright-
moor is a predominantly
black Detroit neighborhood
that confronts issues of pov-
erty, crime and racial ten-
sion. According to Kajeepeta,

the club - comprised of 25
members that host four to
five mass volunteer days each
year and contribute a total of
about 8,000 hours of service
work - originally formed
to help Brightmoor youth,
but now works to benefit the
community in any way pos-
sible.
"(We form) relationships
with the community and use
all the resources we have as
University students to mobi-
lize them and help them
with whatever they need,"
Kajeepeta said. "It is all about
them and what they hope for
their community."
LSA junior Sam Moryk-
was, a BYGP executive board

member, said the club hopes
to provide University stu-
dents with a unique learning
experience by involvingcthem
in the Brightmoor commu-
nity.
"Each aide has many skills
that can benefit the other
side," Morykwas said.
Kajeepeta said she has
learned more about Detroit
and the power of community
relationships through her
involvement.
"Every time I go there I
learn something completely
new ... nothing compares to
being around the people who
live in Brightmoor," Eajeepe-
ta said.

Michigan poised to
free nursing moms
from jury duty
A mother's phone call to a
Michigan legislator will likely
lead to a new state law exempting
breastfeeding mothers from jury
duty.
The Michigan House is expect-
* ed to give final approval to the
bill providing an exemption this
week. If Gov. Rick Snyder signs
it, Michigan would become at
least the 13th state to adopt such
a measure.

teen's girlfriend
heard altercation
The attorney for the family of
a black teenager fatally shot by a
neighborhood watch captain said
yesterday that the boy was talking
to his girlfriend on his cell phone
when the confrontation began.
She did not hear the shooting.
Their phone call was discussed
at a news conference that fol-
lowed announcements that the
U.S. Justice department would
probe the death of 17-year-old
Trayvon Martin and that a local
grand jury will also consider evi-
dence in the case.
George Zimmerman, 28, claims
he shot Martin in self-defense
during a confrontation last month
in a gated community in Sanford,
Fla. Zimmerman spotted Martin
as he was patrolling his neigh-
borhood on a rainy evening and
called 911 to report a suspicious
person. Against the advice of the
911 dispatcher, Zimmerman then
followed Martin, who was walk-
ing home from a convenience
store with a bag of Skittles in his
pocket.

Front-runner Mitt Romney
won the Illinois primary with
ease yesterday night, defeating
Rick Santorum in yet another
industrial state showdown and
padding his already-formidable
delegate lead in the race for the
Republican presidential nomina-
tion.
Romney triumphed after ben-
efitting from a crushing advan-
tage in the television advertising
wars, and as his chief rival strug-
gled to overcome self-imposed
political wounds in the mara-
thon race to pick an opponent
to Democratic President Barack
Obama.
Returns from 29 percent of the

gaining 55 percent of the vote
compared to 28 percent for Santo-

rum, 9 percent for Ron Paul and 7
percent for Newt Gingrich.

A strong 7.4-magnitude earth-

LSA sophomore Mitch Lapoff
said he is disappointed with the
number of home games that will
be offered in accordance with
the rise in ticket prices.
"t've only been a season ticket
holder for two years now, so I'm
not that used to any set price so
I guess I'm more willing to have
a couple years of rising prices,"
Lapoff said. But I'd be alarmed if

Burns added that she and
Canning have specific goals for
changes in LSA courses.
"(One goal is) creating an
economics course for people
who are afraid of Econ 101,"
Burns said. "As well as creating
a new religion program."
Though they are running
uncontested, Canning said that
has not deterred the pair from
campaigning.
"We're trying to treat it like
we're not running unopposed
and that's we really have been

"I think sales might go down
because there are less games,
but at the same time I feel like
Michigan pride is so big that
people are going to buy the tick-

Lochmann said the Univer-

and hopes to maintain that
number for 2012.

Vote OurMichigan
Mersol-Barg and Navvab stand for social justice
nlike previous years, this year's Central Student Government
elections are hotly contested with many deserving candidates
pushing admirable platforms. There are six pairs of presiden-
tial and vice presidential candidates on the ballot this year - each rep-
resenting a myriad of political parties, or no party at all. Whether it's
engaging students through social media, emphasizing social justice,
improving CSG's funding process or focusing on student issues such
as medical amnesty and off-campus housing rights, the candidates all
have compelling visions and each offer something unique to students.
Ultimately, the commitment to social justice of the OurMichigan party
stands out the most.

Michigan's fight song has a verse that includes the
phrase "leaders and the best," and right after we sing it
we shout "Go Blue." Everything about the University of
Michigan teaches us the importance of leadership and
doing our best. We are encouraged to volunteer and give
back to our community. That's why I'm running for presi-
dent of the Central Student Government as part of the
OurMichigan ticket, which envisions CSG as an inclu-
sive and active advocate for students. When you see
the posters and flyers around campus you may wonder,
"does it make a difference who leads student govern-
ment?" Yes, there is a difference between the various
candidates and parties, and let me voice some of our-
Michigan's goals and strategies.
Too often people use the word leadership in affilia-
tion with ideas of power, dominance, or control. In auni-
versity based on a legacy of collective change, activism
and innovation, we in OurMichigan strongly believe in
encouraging leadership as a form of empowerment and
community building. Our platform reflects this commit-
ment through its goals of increasing accessibility, sup-
porting coalitions and providing sustainable avenues for
student engagement.
We must address the high cost of being a student in
Ann Arbor. The financial challenges facedby current and
prospective students threaten our educational opportu-
nities and can diminish the diversity of our student body.
Lack of money can deny students enrollment or heavily
constrain their options for campus activities. How can
students volunteer or be active members in the campus
community when we struggle to pay for tuition, rent and
food with extremely limited funds? Under my adminis-
tration, CSG will answer this question in part by setting
up a University funded food bank. This will help support
students in need. Right now, the University doesn't have
a resource that supports its students with basic living
needs. OurMichigan believes that CSG can do more to
help students with financial hardship.
OurMichigan would like to create a strong advo-
cacy coalition against tuition hikes and in support of
increases in financial aid. We will continue our work
for tuition equality while simultaneously creating
safe spaces in residence halls and campus gathering
locations. This can improve accessibility and security
for our diverse community. We believe CSG can help
implement policies for the recruitment and retention
of all underrepresented communities. With tuition

equality, more financial aid and less drastic tuition
increases, the University can improve its student body
diversity and acceptance rate of lower income students.
Members of my party seek to facilitate leadership
through the process of building coalitions around vital
progressive movements on campus. All student orga-
nizations on campus dedicate their work to effecting
powerful change. Sometimes the visions they commit
resources to overlap with the visions of others. Rather
than work against one another or spend time and money
redundantly, let's find ways to better work together.
OurMichigan understands that CSG can serve as a
platform for collaboration in order to encourage and
strengthen the passionate endeavors of individual stu-
dents or groups. We can create forums for inter-orga-
nizational discussions as well as connect students to
faculty, administrators and the public through town
hall meetings. Collaboration is the most efficacious
strategy for students to create change on campus with
implications that will echo throughout local, state and
national communities.
Corresponding to our emphasis on bringingstudents
together from all walks of life, OurMichigan hopes to
transform CSG into a direct extension of all forms of
student voice and interests. Understanding more of the
challenges and goals from different campus communi-
ties will allow us to use our resources to bridge the gap
between them.
In general, we want to connect CSG to as many
students as possible. Apart from the listening tours,
we will also create a simple, web-based application
so students can more easily get funding for campus
events and projects. Our inclusive approach will be
easily accessible and user-friendly. Through this,
we will improve communication between campus
administrators, CSG and all those whom we represent
in order to facilitate a more open and representative
University.
If you support our vision for leadership, please visit
vote.umich.edu to vote for me, vice-presidential candi-
date Amy Navvab and representative candidates from
OurMichigan. Each vote moves CSG closer to a more
inclusive and considerate resource for all student lead-
ers to add their voice.
Kevin Mersol-Barg is running for Central Student
Government president with the OurMichigan party.

Unlike previous years, this year's Central
Student Government elections are hotly con-
tested with many deserving candidates push-
ing admirable platforms. There are six pairs of
presidential and vice presidential candidates
on the ballot this year - each representing a
myriad of political parties, or no party at all.
Whether it's engaging students through social
media, emphasizing social justice, improving
CSG's funding process or focusing on student
issues such as medical amnesty and off-cam-
pus housing rights, the candidates all have
compelling visions and each offer something
unique to students. Ultimately, the OurMichi-
gan party commitment to social justice of the
OurMichigan stands out the most.
The University has largely been defined
by the activism of its students in the past.
From the initiative to form the Peace Corps
to the large number of University students
in organizations such as Teach for America,
social justice and activism are an integral
part ofthe' University's culture and iden-
tity. OurMichigan emphasizes social justice,
awareness and activism in its platform. It is
this commitment to social justice that make
Mersol-Barg and Navaab well-suited to be
the face of the student body. OurMichigan's
platform focuses on reaching out to under-
represented student groups to give them a
voice in student government.
OurMichigan highlights issues such as
tuition equality, minority retention and mak-
ing college more accessible and affordable to
all students. OurMichigan envisions a coali-
tion based government, where students at the
grassroots level are able to organize and push
relevant policies for students. The party pro-
poses solid initiatives such as creating a food
bank to aid financially strapped college stu-
dents and implementing a student leadership
trainingtoenhance the University's reputation
as the "leaders and the best."
Though OurMichigan has a promising vision
for social justice, its platform appeals to a con-
centrated group. If elected, the party should
also work to incorporate other student inter-
ests into studentcgovernment. Mersol-Barg and
Navvab should draw on the platforms of their
counterparts as well - ideas such as making
CSG more pertinent to all studentsbyengaging
them through social media. OurMichigan will
have to work to ensure all students are involved

so CSG becomes relevant in routine campus
affairs.
Each of the other candidates have unique
strengths and impressive plans for campus
improvement - ideas thatcshouldn't go without
mention. MForward presented a comprehen-
sive platform focusing on medical amnesty,
financial transparency and making students
aware of off-campus housing rights. However,
the inner-party politicsthat defined the party's
nominating process are a cause for hesitation.
YouMICH highlighted the importance
of making it easier for student groups to get
funding and proposed streamlining the finan-
cial aid process. CSG presidential candidate
Shreya Singh's work with revampingthe fund-
ing application is a testament to her ability to
make this happen. Overall, YouMICH pres-
ents realistic and pragmatic goals, goals that
could easily be achieved and are needed for the
University. But, the focus of their platform is
extremely specific and doesn't include a broad
visionto expand CSG's role to anything beyond
what it already does.
Independent candidates Manish Parikh and
Omar Hashwi stressed the need to use social
media to reach out to students and make CSG
a viable presence in students' lives. Their use of
memes to advertise their campaign reinforces
their ability to appeal to the student body. They
also proposed adding a polling commission to
CSG that would collect student opinions on
campus affairs. Their focus on representing
students along with their creativity, energy
and vigor is commendable. However, they lack
concrete plans to implement their ideas. The
fact that they don't have a focused vision raises
concerns about how many of their policies will
be achievable in a year.
This year's CSG elections present students
with a tough decision. There are numerous
candidates, all of whom are passionate about
the University and bring innovative platforms
to the table. What separates OurMichigan's
platform from the others is its commitment to
make CSG relevant for students that don't cur-
rently have a significant voice in student gov-
ernment by giving a platform to social justice
issues that define the identity ofthis institution.
For this year's election, The Michigan Dai-
ly's editorial board endorses KEVIN MER-
SOL-BARG and AMY NAVVAB for CSG
president and vice president.

RYAN ROBERTSI W

Moving MForward

As the president of the University's Engineering
Council, I have been able to view the Central Student
Government with a unique outside perspective. I have
watched as MForward transitioned CSG from an orga-
nization that focuses merely on political posturing to
one that successfully advocates for students at the Uni-
versity, local and state level. In March 2010, MForward
formed promising big changes to campus - and back
then, as is happening today, naysayers said that student
government at the University was powerless. Instead
of focusing on bettering this University for decades
to come, it should provide "tangible" programs and
events for students.
Since its formation two years ago, MForward has
delivered on its promises. Under former student
body President Chris Armstrong, the organization
successfully implemented a gender-neutral option
in University Housing. Under the direction of Presi-
dent DeAndree Watson, state appropriations to the
University increased for the first time in more than a
decade as a result of extensive lobbying efforts in Lan-
sing through the Student Association of Michigan. But
MForward hasn't restricted itself to these large issues
- small programs and changes have also been part of
the MForward platform. For example, forthe first time
in years, students can again enjoy a meal in the resi-
dence halls on Saturday night. In addition, CSG hosted
a tailgate before the Notre Dame night game last fall
that attracted more than 8,000 students and greatly
reduced the number of hospital visits due to alcohol
poisoning as compared to other football Saturdays.
I am confident that Aditya Sathi, Louis Mirante and
the entire MForward slate will continue to deliver
promising changes to students. For example, con-
sider Sathi's work on a medical amnesty policy that
would eliminate the risk of receiving Minor in Pos-
session of Alcohol charges when emergency services
are requested for an alcohol-related incident. This
program encourages students to contact emergency
services when necessary and has been proven to save
lives at other universities. Thanks to the hard work of
Sathi and others in MForward, a bill implementing this
policy has passed in the Michigan House of Represen-
tatives and is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate.
Members will also work to establish greater student

representation on University decision-making com-
mittees, including the University's Board of Regents.
While opponents of change and greater student repre-
sentation say this is impossible and requires an amend-
ment to the state constitution, they are wrong. In fact,
Wayne State University and Michigan State University
both provide student representation on their govern-
ing boards and the same constitutional provisions bind
them. Gaining greater representation for students is
possible, and under MForward it will get done.
MForward members believe that student govern-
ment must accomplish small goals as well. They will
work with other campus organizations to implement
a bike share program on campus to provide public-
access bikes to students. The CSG website has the
ability to bring students and student government
closer together by informing students what represen-
tatives are working on and by publicizing how CSG
funds are utilized. Shreya Singh, current treasurer
of CSG and youMICH presidential candidate, did not
put CSG financial information online despite multiple
requests. Sathi and Mirante will make sure that the
campus community can find out what CSG does with
student money by making the information available
online.
Some parties will have you believe that CSG must
become smaller and less significant. They say they
want student government to be more "pragmatic," but
this is only a code word for unimaginative and unin-
spired. I am proud to be part of an impressive group
of organizations and leaders that oppose this narrow
view and endorse MForward and their vision for a stu-
dent government that can promote big, lasting change,
just as it has already done. MForward has been sup-
ported by an incredibly impressive list of leaders
including Denard Robinson, Jay Gage and Kevin Tatu-
lyan, the president and vice president of the Student
Association of Michigan. If you believe that student
government shouldn't confine itself to a narrow set
of issues, take 60 seconds to log on to vote.umich.edu
today or tomorrow and vote for MForward's impres-
sive slate of student leaders.

T SSEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

As University students, we
have apowerful voice
TO THE DAILY:
In the March 18 viewpoint entitled, "Prag-
matic Goals for CSG", Michael Budros - vice
chair of CSG's Student Organization Funding
Commission - made the case for why you-
MICH should be elected as the representatives
and leaders of our student body while simul-
taneously offending an important part of that
community. He wrote: "Nor should we expect
our student leaders to be able to overturn
decades of legal and legislative precedents to
offer illegal immigrants in-state tuition."
As formerly undocumented immigrants and
student activists, we were personally offended
by his use of the "I" word, a racially charged
slur used to dehumanize an entire population
in our country, and by his undermining of the
work accomplished bythe Coalition for Tuition
Equality.
We have both spoken on behalf of the coali-
tion, personally addressing the University's
Board of Regents at its past two meetings. And
the regents were receptive to our message.
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann Arbor) addition-

ally asked Provost Philip Hanlon to provide
them with more information regarding our
issue.
We recognize that as individual students
we have a powerful voice and that we can ini-
tiate change on this campus. Our university
has a long and vibrant legacy of social change
and activism, and we seek to continue it. We
believe that tuition equality can and will hap-
pen at the University, and we know that the
support offered by the current CSG adminis-
tration has been instrumental to the success
of our movement. Conscious of his agency as
a CSG representative, the coalition's founder
and OurMichigan presidential candidate,
Kevin Mersol-Barg strategically utilized the
resources available to him through such posi-
tion in order to bring this issue to the eyes of
administration.
It is obvious to us and students on this cam-
pus that this is the kind of change we need in
Central Student Government. As candidates
with OurMichigan, if elected, we pledge to con-
tinue advocating for meaningful change.

Learning wisdom

A new kind of travel

The end is near for us graduates
to be, and in the next few weeks,
we'll be getting lots of advice.
With anecdotes, aph-
orisms and earnest
looks, those who have
been where we are
now will share their
hard-earned wisdom.
Some of it will be
idle speculation. Any-
one who's seen "The
Graduate" remem- SETH
bers the neighbor's SODERBORG
prophecy to Dustin
Hoffman - "Plas-
tics!" - and knows that such suggestions
are worth less than the effort it takes to
make them.
But some of these things will change
our lives. If we listen carefully, we Mpight
manage to catch a little of our anteced-
ents' wisdom without having to earn
it. That would be a wonderful thing, for
much of what they will share are lessons
learned from mistakes.
In theory, at least, the people who will
speak with us are full of wisdom we do
not yet possess. The prospect of hearing
them has led me to wonder about those
people and what it is they know. What
does it mean to be wise? What kinds of
things might a wise person tell us? And,
vexingly, if the lessons they share with us
were drawn from their lives, will it really
be possible to apply them to our own?
Most of us know the refrain "You don't
know what it's like!" with which ado-
lescents distance themselves from their
0 parents. There's a part of me that worries
that, in fact, those around us don't know
what it's like to be us, here, now.
One of the main themes of the speech-
es will be our pending entry into the "real
world." The speaker's wisdom is, one sup-
poses, that he or she knows something of
this other world that we do not. If that is
what makes them worth hearing, perhaps
we should be worried about our futures.
In one of the saddest moments in our
country's history, shortly after the death
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Rohert Kennedy spoke to a disconsolate
Indiana crowd ahout the kind of nation
we are and where we might want to go.
His own difficult life was very much on
his mind.
In his brief remarks, Kennedy quoted
Aeschylus's "Agamemnon," one of the
first books I read in college. The line he
chose said that wisdom comes through
suffering: "Even in our sleep, pain which
cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the
heart until, in our own despair, against
our will, comes wisdom through the

awful grace of God."
There's a whole genre, call it the Great
American Novel, that tells stories of men
- the ones about men seem to win more
prizes - who wake up in the morning and
realize they've done it all wrong. This is
the Aeschylus kind of wisdom - pain-
ful knowledge, slowly accumulated, that
leaks from regret-filled people.
Stories like these are popular, and that
should give us pause. Do most people
wake up one morning certain that the
preceding 25 years were a waste? Are we
on track to do the same? Advice will come
our waybecause our elders hope that wis-
dom can be transferred, less painfully, to
those who will listen.
Listen to people
who were once
in our shoes.
At Kenyon College in 2005, author
David Foster Wallace told graduating
seniors that a liheral education gives con-
trol over "howand whatyouthink."Incthe
real world, where the way one sees what
happens is the product of patterns that
"you gradually slip into, day after day, get-
ting more and more selective about what
you see and how you measure value with-
out everbeing fully aware that that's what
you're doing," control over what and how
one thinks is a kn of freedom.
Being trained in thought means that if
we put in the time, we can figure out what
it i we're trying to achieve. Itngives us the
chance to understand what's pushing us
to chase our goal. The choices we make
now will set the course of our lives more
than many others - it would be prudent,
maybe even wise, to make such choices
conscious of our reasons.
Choose to think about why you want
the things you are pursuing. Use your
freedom to examine your motivations. Do
your due diligence - know the costs of
whatcyou hope to achieve and weighethem
carefully. Then move forward, confident
in the knowledge that if someday in the
middle ofyourlife you,like Dantewake to
find yourself in dark woods you'll at least
know why you're there. Self-knowledge,
kept, is a sure bulwark against regret.

met this guy who liked to talk
about infinity. He was tall, healthy,
6 foot 2, and he
thought about things 4
- a lot. Everything ,
was a question; noth-
ing could be solved.
Well, unless he pro-
posed the ideas. We
must talk about life,
he said. Liberty. The MELANIE
Pursuit of Happy- KRUVELIS
ness and other Will
Smith movies. "Don't
you realize we're all infinite?" he yelled,
sloshing beer all over my shoes. A real
prophetic Buzzed Lightyear.
And the strangest thing - well,
besides the fact that I was awake at 5
a.m. in Valencia, Spain, watching the
entire city burn alive for a festival that
celebrates man's right to ignite - was
that I didn't hate him. This man of the-
ory and meaning and all those terrible
things - this man was not hated. In the
72 hours I spent in his normally nause-
ating, pseudo-intellectual presence, I
never considering grabbing that hemp
necklace around his neck and strangling
him until there was no tomorrow. Au
contraire. I fell in love. And I fell hard.
I promise, this is not a love story. Nor
is this a poorly written Carrie Bradshaw
rant about how great sex is in Europe -
after all, as an empiricist I couldn't make
such a claim in good consciousness. No,
the subject matter of this poorly writ-
ten rant is CouchSurfing. And why this
website made me stop brushing my hair
and start believing in humanity.
My lover's name was Miguel, by the
way. Or, more precisely, Miguel was the
name of my feigning prophet lover. But
he wasn't the only inamorato I made
that weekend. There was the girl with
the dolphin laugh. The girl with the

dragon tattoos. The feisty blonde Ger-
man who was last seen looking for her
pants. And the kind of smelly Italian kid
who was never ten centimeters away
from a bottle of hair gel. In just a matter
of hours, this free floor to crash on, this
free shower to neglect to use and these
people - these strange, wonderful,
shiny happy freaky people - became to
me what peanut butter is to jelly. Which
is to say, a sandwich.
Before Igo off and grabmy cake of rain-
bows and smiles from the oven, I'd like to
address your concerns about CouchSurf-
ing, because I have a hunch that no mat-
ter how much weed you're smoking right
now, you must be wondering how much
weed I was smoking when I signed up for
this freak show. The answer is a lot but
that's really not the point. CouchSurfing
is an online community where members
can create profiles to either host guests
or find a couch to drool on for a couple
of nights - for free. And yes, of course,
Mom, the site is teeming with thieves,
axe murderers and Ponzi schemers.After
all, with more than a million users and
reviews in The New York Times, Time
magazine and now the world-renowned
Michigan Daily, we can only presume
that the Hitlers of the world congregate
here to do bad things to weird people.
But in all seriousness, we all know
that the neo-Nazis aren't really good
with computers, and if you just use a bit
of common sense, it's not hard to be a
safe surfer. For instance, do you request
to surf with a 35-year-old man who,
accordingto his profile, only has a couch
for blonde women between the ages of 18
and 22 with bra sizes between 34C and
38DD? Perhaps. But if you'd rather not
wake toa large man friend smelling your
hair, pick the vegetarian. The vegan.
The macrobiotic tree bark eater. Anyone
who describes themselves as looking for

their place in the universe. These are the
people you want. These are the people
who will make you breakfast (tree bark
tea with a side of stick), who will give you
space, tell you whatto do and where to go
- probably somewhere with trees.
But sometimes, you decide to stay

with the guy who "likes to party" and
doesn't own any yoga mats. And that's
okay too. Because maybe you'll end up
sleeping on the floor with ten other
surfers. Ten other Brits. Californians.
Swedes that are far too attractive to
even be in the same room as you. Ten
other nomads who just want to figure
out how to see everything with the ten
bucks they've got. You wouldn't think
something as trivial as frugality would
bring people together, but after our first
meal together, well, we kind of became
inseparable, this non-functional unit
of sorts. I guess that's called a family.
It was more than just people looking
to drop their crap off in some random
dude's apartment while they go get
hammered in a new city. They were
looking for new people and new things.
And that's the story of how traveling
can change and should change. Ad infi-
nitum.

We are the only party prepared to hold
the University accountable for abandon-
ing its defense of affirmative action,
refusing to lead the fight to increase
public funding for education, becoming
more the creature of its corporate donors
and less a place that stands for academic
freedom.
Student-led struggles have made the
University a standard-bearer for inte-
gration and equality. When affirmative
action came under attack in Michigan
in Grutter v. Bollinger, we as the student
interveners led the fight to defend affir-
mative action as co-defendants with the
University. In 2003, DAAP led the cam-
pus and the nation in mobilizing 50,000
students to march at the Supreme Court
as the arguments were heard in the Uni-
versity affirmative action cases. That
mobilization won a historic victory
upholding affirmative action.
The challenges we face and the oppor-
tunities we have now stem from the con-
tradictions coming out of the Grutter

case and the increasing conflict between
the two poles of leadership in the fight
for affirmative action: the student move-
ment and the University administration.
The University's defense of affirma-
tive action was based on their First
Amendment rights to create a diverse
student body, rather than the rights
of minority students to obtain equal-
ity. This emphasis on the power and the
rights of the University has created a
climate in which minority students are
made to feel dependent on the adminis-
tration to defend their right to be on cam-
pus. Now, the University has abandoned
its defense of affirmative action both by
refusing to express public support for
the legal effort to overturn Prop 2 and
restore affirmative action, and by allow-
ing minority enrollment to drop precipi-
tously. It is becoming increasingly clear
that we cannot depend on the University,
and we mustbuild an independent move-
ment in order to win now.
The University's abandonment of this
fight is tied up with its increased privati-
zation. Anticipating defeat in the Grutter
case, the University raised large sums of
private money to use for minority schol-
arships in order to mitigate the effects of
the loss of public scholarships. Through
this process, the University has become
the most privatized public university in
the nation. Those private donors, who
are now calling all the shots, are no lon-
ger interested in maintaining affirmative

action because they are trying to lower
living standards and want to bury issues
of racism and inequality. This privatiza-
tion has caused an erosion of academic
freedom and has distorted the mission of
the University. The only way to restore
the public character of the University
now is to win a definitive victory for
affirmative action.
Students who want to defend affir-
mative action and public education now
must turn to the power of the student
body. We need student leaders who are
prepared to speak the truth about rac-
ism. Thevastmajorityofstudents oppose
racism and want an integrated campus,
but if we don't speak up, we allow the
small number of blatantly racist people
to determine the climate on campus. The
burden of speaking out against racism
cannot be placed solely on the shoulders
of minority students.
We want a University where everyone
can develop to their greatest potential,
where research is driven by the needs
of humanity, not profit, and where our
dreams are not crushed and our talents
are not squandered.
We are not just asking for your vote;
we are calling on you to act and join the
new civil rights movement.

In referencing Dr. Seuss's light-
hearted children's story, "Oh, the Places
You'll Go!," a meaningful message about
the importance of seizing new opportu-
nities, keeping an open-mind, and try-
ing new things stands out. I've learned
that life is certainly one huge adventure,
jam-packed with unexpected twists and
turns. The excitement, adventure and
craziness of these experiences, how-
ever, make life special and create long
lasting memories.
This underlying message about tak-
ing chances and pushing beyond your
comfort zone has inspired me to take
advantage of the country I live in by
experiencing the United States' unique
culture and distinguishing geographi-
cal features. There's so much waiting
at your fingertips, so adventure beyond
the borders of Michigan this summer
and broaden your horizons. As college
students, we're young, full of energy
and passion, and we possess a strong
sense of adventure. Be responsible,
make good choices, but most of all,
have fun while you explore and dis-
cover the hidden gems in the Land of
the Free.
Once you get behind the wheel or
find your seat 14C on the airplane, the
adventure begins. Whether you're head-
ed north, east, south or west, you'll be
exposed to new scenery, authentic cui-
sine and diverse lifestyles. To kick-start
your tour of the United States, there a
few destinations that should receive top
priority on the travel list:
""I left myheart in San Francisco."
Get a taste of the laid-back West Coast
atmosphere by visiting San Francisco,
home of the Golden Gate Bridge and
Fisherman's Wharf. "San Fran" is a
popular tourist destination filled with
California sunshine, high spirits and
wonderful adventure. Take a tour of
Alcatraz and see the prison cells that
the Anglin brothers and Frank Mor-
ris busted out of nearly 50 years ago.
Spend some time at Pier 39 to see hun-
* dreds of enormous sea lions barking and
lounging all day long. Walking along
the Golden Gate Bridge - the ultimate

symbol of the city - is a must. Take lots
of pictures so you can look back on this
experience ten years from now.
*"It's up to.you, New York, New
York." If you've never been to the "city
that never sleeps," the glamorous lights
of Broadway await you, so prepare to
submerge yourself in a hectic city that
bustles around the clock. From the mon-
umental Statue of Liberty to the famous
American Museum of Natural History,
New York City is a magical place filled
with plenty of energy and entertain-
ment. There's quite a lot of culture to
explore in this chaotic yet one-of-a kind
East Coast hot spot.
""Welcome To D.C." Visiting our
nation's capital, though a less leisurely
and more educational trip, will be a
rewarding and enriching experience.
Take a stroll through The National Mall
and touch the Washington Monument,
one of the classic symbols of American
government. Spend hours at the Smith-
sonian museums where you can explore
American history, wildlife or aeronau-
tic exhibits. While you're out and about
sightseeing, be sure to snap photos by
the White House, the U.S. Capitol and
the Lincoln Memorial.
If you're adventurous enough to
think outside the box even further,
experience America's natural beauty by
visiting the Grand Canyon or immerse
yourself in American pop culture while
dancing at a live country music "honky-
tonk" in Nashville.
There really are no limits or bound-
aries. It's important to take advantage
of all the opportunities that allow us
to experience things we wouldn't nor-
mally be exposed to on a daily basis.
Gaining a rich and diverse cultural
understanding and appreciation of our
country can go a long way, so these des-
tinations across the United States mark
the beginning of your traveling expedi-
tions. An open mind can get you all the
way to San Francisco.

ALLISON SHERMANI
Support LSA-SG's new constitution

While Thomas Jefferson may not
have been at the Constitutional Con-
vention in 1787, he believed that the
document should be rewritten every 19
years. While the U.S. Constitution has
prevailed for more than 220 years, LSA
Student Government's Constitution,
written in 1993, has reached its 19th
birthday. LSA-SG's founders created a
strong foundation for our organization,
but a lot has changed since then, nearly
two decades later. This semester, LSA-
SG decided to amend their constitu-
tion. The amendment process happens
by and for the students, and in order
to adopt the new constitution, LSA-SG
needs the approval of the majority of
student voters in the winter election.
LSA-SG has made tremendous devel-
opments over the years, and we have
decided to update our constitution
accordingly. While these changes serve
to benefit our organization, the moti-
vation behind making them is student
driven: we want to reach out to each indi-
vidual, and the revised constitution lays
the foundations to do so.
One of the largest changes is to our
mission statement. Old and dated, the
original was long, repetitive and ambig-

uous. Collectively, we agreed to make it
more succinct, focusingon ourone, main
purpose: "LSA Student Government
shall be the democratic government
representing the entire Student Body
of the College of Literature, Science
and the Arts. The Government shall
actively seek the voices of LSA students
and advocate their interests to improve
academic and non-academic life." We
wanted to guarantee that our statement
became short, simple and translatable
by every student in the college, and we
truly believe that we have succeeded in
doing so. Our responsibility as a student
government is to serve the students in
whatever way possible. It's important
for LSA students to know that not only
do we speak up to administrators, we
are a resource to improve the college
in a multitude of realms. We want to
interact more with student organiza-
tions and different parts of campus. We
are able to do this by awarding students
money for events and simply listening to
students' desires.
Additional changes include elimi-
nating the LSA Judiciary - which has
not been represented in LSA-SG for
more than four years - and expand-

ing legal disputes through the Central
Student Judiciary. Also, many terms,
government positions and actions were
phrased in a confusing manner. The
new constitution is streamlined, orga-
nized and clearly defines these posi-
tions and procedures.
Members of LSA-SG approved the new
constitution on Feb. 22 during our gener-
al meeting. During the All-Campus elec-
tions on March 21 and 22, we encourage
LSA students to approve updates to our
constitution. In addition, drafts of the
improved constitution are available on
the LSA-SG website (www.lsasg.umich.
edu) for LSA students to review. We
want you to know that these changes do
not just benefit our organization but will
improve the LSA community as a whole.
Thomas Jefferson once said, "Democra-
cywill cease to existwhenyou take away
from those who are willing to work." Let
us work for you to improve the College of
Literature, Science and the Arts. Please
take the time to support the amended
constitution and other LSA-SG projects
by voting in the winter elections.

SG Counsel and is an LSA junior.

JUMP FOR JOY

In penultimate meeting,
CSG discusses resolutions

Potential policies to
be terminated if not
voted on by next
week
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
Eight resolutions were intro-
duced at the penultimate Central
Student Government assembly
meeting of this year's term on
topics including CSG operations
and preparations for the incom-
ing assembly.
One resolution would resolve
an ongoing debate about how
best to balance speed and suffi-
cient legislative oversight by the
Student Organization Funding
Commission when distributing
funding.
Currently, the assembly
approves SOFC's budget ret-
roactively, and many fear that
resolutions would slow down the
organization's ability to award
funding. After some members of
SOFC expressed concern over
the contents of the resolution, the
assembly chose to refrain from
voting on it until next week.
The resolution was first read on
Feb. 14, and Business senior Matt
Eral, the speaker of the assembly,
said he was frustrated because he
significantly changed the resolu-
tion since its first introduction,
only to see it postponed again.

While Eral said the delay was a
"bit personally annoying," he said
support from the SOFC chairs is
necessary.
Eral added that this resolu-
tion, which has been introduced
for more than five weeks, will be
terminated if it is not passed next
week. Assembly protocol states
that resolutions that do not pass
by the end of the term will be con-
cluded.
"Either the assembly will pass
it next week or it will be killed
because the new assembly does
not get to ... carry business over,"
Eral said.
Business junior Shreya Singh,
CSG treasurer, also gave a pre-
sentation to the assembly about
CSG's budget and said she would
like to ensure the use of all fund-
ing awarded to CSG.
Singh said $60,000 will roll
over to the budget for CSG's next
term unless the money is utilized
through the actions of commis-
sions before the end of the cur-
rent term.
Singh added that the organiza-
tions that receive funding from
SOFC have been using more of
those funds. Traditionally, orga-
nizations have spent about 75
percent of the funding awarded to
them, but that number has risen
to 85 percent since the introduc-
tion of SOFC's new weekly roll-
ing funding system - a program
in which organizations can apply
to receive funding on a weekly
basis, instead of receiving allo-

cated funds in shifts throughout
the semester.
The assembly also passed a
resolution in support of making
the Big House a "zero-waste" sta-
dium, meaningthatas much trash
as possible will either be recycled
or composted instead of sent to
landfills.
Rackham student Leah Zim-
merman, a member of the Erb
Institute - an organization
focused on using business to bol-
ster sustainability efforts around
the world - attended the meet-
ing to speak on the resolution's
behalf.
"Overwhelmingly, 100 percent
of the people on campus and the
alumni we've talked to have been
not just supportive, but enthusi-
astic," Zimmerman said.
Members of the CSG Environ-
mental Issues Commission came
to the meeting to publicize an
event scheduled to occur Monday
on the Diag to increase environ-
mental awareness in celebration
of Earth Day.
LSA senior Madeline Caldwell,
EIC treasurer, spoke to the
assembly about the event and
said several University organiza-
tions will be participating.
. "It's a good event for stu-
dents to come raise awareness
and learn about cool opportuni-
ties to get involved on campus,"
Caldwell said. "I think (the envi-
ronment) is something we're
really going to need to think
about going into our future."

and staff are sent an e-mail
notification when the system
activates, it takes a long time to
process, Brown said. An addi-
tional 32 percent of students, as
well as 31 percent of faculty and
41 percent of staff, have another
device registered for more fre-
quent and detailed messages.
The system was active for
Thursday's emergency and sent
an initial e-mail and text mes-
sage notice about the National
Weather Service's tornado
warning. At 6:30 p.m. another
e-mail update was sent when
the warning was extended to
7:15 p.m. Finally, at 7:15, an
e-mail was sent to alert the
University community that the
warning had expired, but a flash
flood warning and thunder-
storm watch were still in effect.
According to Perry Samson,
professor of atmospheric sci-
ence, there is no sure way of sci-
entifically predicting a tornado
far in advance, especially in the
spring.
"A tornado this time of year
would never be expected,"
Samson wrote in an e-mail

interview. "That said, the atmo-
spheric models that day did
show great potential for convec-
tion. It is easy now in hindsight
to see that the potential peaked
in the late afternoon at a level
higher than (at least I expect-
ed."
Samson added that determin-
ing a storm's exact location is
difficult, and said he was sur-
prised that it touched down in
Dexter.
He also wrote that, with the
exception of 2011, which saw a
series of devastating tornadoes
in Alabama, Mississippi and
Georgia, deaths due to torna-
does have been limited since
1970.
Samson credits technological
advantages for these improved
percentages.
"Much of this decrease can
be directly attributed to the
improved forecasting of storm
formation plus improved radar
capability, hand-in-hand with
more personal and mobile
notification systems," Samson
wrote. "As we reach the point
when all can receive notifica-
tion, (our) next challenge is to
impress upon the population the
value of heedingthese warnings
and the need to improve access

While DPS primarily uses the
emergency alert system to send
out weather-related warnings
that could potentially affect
campus, it has also been used
for other threatening incidents,
such as a reported gunman on
campus, large gas leaks and
two separate armed robberies
in 2010, according to Univer-
sity emergency manager Andy
Burchfield.
Burchfield added that DPS
tests the system routinely twice
a year, once in the spring and in
the fall.
With evolving technology
and continued reliance on text
messaging as the quickest and
most efficient mode of com-
munication, the decision to
implement the emergency alert
system was a crucial move for
DPS.
"From the University's per-
spective, it's to put forward our
best foot in trying to help people
better prepare themselves for
emergencies that could occur,"
Burchfield said. "The U-M
emergency alert system is one
more key source that is available
to our faculty, staff and students
that they can utilize and regis-
ter for in order to receive alerts
when potential imminent dan-
ger may impact them."
Brown added that the sys-
tem is especially important in
the age of texting.
"As it grew in popular-
ity and acceptance and as ven-
dors were able to find ways to
advance text messages, then
the University looked for ways
to explore how we could fit
that into our way of commu-
nicating with text messages,"
Brown said.
The system is one of a com-
bination of resources that
DPS wants the community to
utilize in case of emergency,
along with television, news
and the outdoor warning
sirens, according to Burch-
field.
"The more resources you
have in your toolbox, the bet-
ter prepared you're going to
be. That's why we really advo-
cate for people to register for
this system because this does
key in on the University itself,"
Burchfield said.
Social Work student Kelly
Pearson said she registered for
the alert system when she was
a freshman at the University.
"I thought that if some-
thing was happening on cam-
pus, it would be good to know
about it," Pearson said. "I have
unlimited texting, so I figured
it was better to be safe than
sorry."
The continuous text mes-
sage updates confirmed the
severity of the storm for Pear-
son, who was at Dominick's on
Monroe Street when the storm
started, and helped her decide
to take precaution.
"Especially when I got an
alert that the tornado was
actually close by in Dexter I
thought 'OK, let's go down-
stairs and take cover,"' Pear-
son said. "The alerts gave more
details and updates as the

storm was progressing, get-
ting closer and getting worse."
The emergency alert system
is set for its spring test Friday
at noon.

Even though the costumes

flair as well. Rather than dressing

to this specific period.
A central aspect of the opera
is the exploration of a man's
response to greed and how that
greed affects him.
"The moral of the piece is that
'for idle hands and hearts and

is what happens to Tom. We see
contemporary parallels to what
happens in this 18th-century
setting, and it's very interesting
in that way."

"What a pair. Double D's. Pok-
ing up at me like twin peaks. Pam
Anderson, eat your heart out. Too
bad they're attached to a four-
teen-year-old boy."
So begins Anthony Youn's "In
Stitches," a refreshingly hon-
est and humorous memoir about
the life of a surgeon in the mak-
ing. For pre-med students curi-
ous about what it actually takes
to become a doctor, "In Stitches"
offers a one-of-a-kind look into
the transformation from college
kid to working physician.
Youn, an Asian American
who grew up in the small, pre-
dominately Caucasian town of
Greenville, Mich., said the book
chronicles his evolution from a
shy, "wallflower-type" kid to a
successful plastic surgeon who
makes appearances on shows
such as "Dr. 90210," "The Rachael
Ray Show" and "The O'ReillyFac-
tor."
"The first third of the book is
about growing up in Michigan
feeling kind of like an outsider,
kind of like an ugly duckling,"
Youn said. "And then itprogresses
through college where I went four
years without a date ... the last
two-thirds of the book are about
medical school and the process of
becoming a doctor."
With stories including a
recounting of his date with a
fire-eating carnival worker and
a description of his small-town
roots, "In Stitches" differs enor-
mously from the medical memoirs
that typically occupy bookstore
shelves.
"I've read a lot of medical mem-
oirs by physicians, and to me, they
all came across as being overly
serious," Youn said. "In a lot of
ways, the books focused on keep-
ing the doctor as the hero of the
story. And what I wanted to write
was a book about becoming a doc-
tor (and) the process of medical
school in particular."
"These books were typically
written by 50-something-year-
old men who wrote stories about
how they change patients' lives.
And my book is exactly the oppo-
site of that."
Youn said he wanted to write
a book of equal parts truthful
and funny that would appeal to a
broad range of audiences.

Michigan coach Red Berenson will take Michigan to its 22nd-consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance this weekend.
Michigan not concerned
withcomeback troubles

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
With the start of the NCAA
Tournament just days away,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
reflected on one of the best come-
backs he's witnessed in his tenure
as coach of the Michigan hockey
team.
His thoughts turned back to a
different tournament - a game
against Denver in 1999.
With the Wolverines trailing
by three, Berenson called a time-
out midway through the second
period to try and put some life
back in his squad.
"I just talked to the team,"
Berenson said. "Just reminded
them why we came here, how we
have to play to be a good team."
Michigan left the bench a
rejuvenated team and went on to
trounce Denver, 5-3.
So, where was that same sense
of comeback during Saturday's
CCHA Championship game
against Western Michigan, a
contest in which No. 2 Michigan
trailed by three for most of the
game? According to senior for-
ward David Wohlberg, it's always
there - the Wolverines just had a
little difficulty unearthing it.
"It's tough to dig a hole for
yourself and then have to come
out of it," Wohlberg said. "Coach-

Had everything gone accord-
ing to plan, senior guards Zack
Novak and Stu Douglass and the
rest of the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team would be busy prep-
ping for a Sweet 16 matchup with
North Carolina.
But after an upset by Ohio sent
the Wolverines packing, it's time
for a first look ahead at a 2012-
13 campaign that may bring the
program's highest preseason
expectations since 1996, when
the team opened the year ranked
No. 7.
Since he finished an impres-
sive freshman campaign in 2011,
there have been talks surround-
ing the chances of sophomore
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. bolting
for the NBA this offseason. But
after a less-than-stellar shoot-
ing performance for much of
the year, murmurs of the Miami
native leaving have quieted.
And ever since November's
Maui Invitational, when fresh-
man Trey Burke burst onto the
scene - prompting ESPN NBA
Draft analyst Chad Ford to tell
The Michigan Daily he believed
Burke would be a first-round
pick this summer - rumors have
swirled about Burke departing,
too.
But in the locker room after
the Wolverines' loss last week-
end, both underclassmen
pledged to return to Ann Arbor
for next season.
With Burke and Hardaway Jr.
back, along with the best recruit-
ing class the program has seen
in well over a decade, Michigan
is expected to open next year
ranked near the top 10.
Let's take a look at what next
season's roster will look like:
Point guard: projected starter
- Burke.
Assuming Burke returns, he
may be a unanimous selection
for All-Big Ten first team, and
he should find himself near the
top of the preseason list for the
Bob Cousy Award, given to the
nation's top point guard. Burke
has already demonstrated lead-
ership ability, and Novak - who
has been grooming the freshman
- indicated that Burke should be
a captain next season.
A healthy Burke, along with a
more talented surrounding cast,
should spell trouble for foes.
Expect his 4.6 assists per game
to increase with more scorers
on the floor, while his already
impressive 2.8 turnovers could
drop, as his decision-making
improves with another year
under his belt.
But Burke will be tasked with
an even greater burden than this
year, when he led the team with
36.1 minutes per game. Douglass
was Burke's backup this year,
and his departure leaves a glar-
ing void on the bench behind the
Columbus native.
Just two other players on the
roster have (albeit limited) point
guard experience: freshman
Carlton Brundidge and junior
Eso Akunne.
In only 44 minutes this sea-
son - and just nine in confer-

ence play - Brundidge looked
overmatched on the floor. His
five turnovers in limited action
is concerning, and his ball han-
dling and quickness don't appear
to be Big Ten-quality. A sparse-
ly used Akunne, who's also a
below-average ball handler, is a
last resort.
Guard/wing: projected start-
ers - Hardaway Jr. and incoming
freshman forward Glen Robinson
Ill.
Hardaway Jr. should be hun-
gry to improve upon a disap-
pointing sophomore campaign,
when his 3-point shooting took
a significant step back. Though
his scoring numbers improved
slightly, his field-goal percentage
dropped slightly and his 3-point
mark fell to an abysmal 28.3 per-
cent.
Still, Hardaway Jr. has one of
the wing positions locked down.
His running mate remains a
mystery. Douglass, the starter
at two-guard for most of year,
played 33 minutes during con-
ference play and was Michigan's
most reliable on-ball defender.
Junior guard Matt Vogrich
saw a drop in his minutes this
year, and though he should see
more time next year, he's not
starter material. Vogrich - a
sharpshooter who struggled to
find his touch for a long stretch
of conference play - possesses
some of Novak's tenacity at chas-
ing down loose balls against
more physically gifted athletes,
but his shortcomings are too
much. Vogrich is too slow to stay
with opposing wingmen, and he
lacks the first step to create his
own shot.
Don't expect blog-writing
junior guard Josh Bartelstein to
grow into a formidable option
this offseason, which means
Michigan coach John Beilein
will have to rely on a newcomer,
either guard Nik Stauskas or
Robinson III.
Stauskas, a 6-foot-5 Canada
native is one of the most dan-
gerous 3-point shooters in the
nation. Stauskas is more of a true
shooting guard than Robinson,
but he has the ability to get to
the basket and create his own
shot, earning him four stars from
Rivals.com.
Robinson, the son of former
NBA star Glen "Big Dog" Rob-
inson, is a true wing player. He
appeared more talented than
Stauskas, but will Beilein want
a second wing on the floor to
accompany Hardaway Jr.? The
two players' style of play closely
resemble each other, and since
Hardaway Jr. struggles to defend
shooting guards, it'd be risky to
throw an inexperienced wing
on the floor to guard the opposi-
tion's two-guard.
Expect to see Stauskas and
Vogrich on the floor at times, but
it'll be Robinson's name called
over the PA system before games.
Post: projected starters -
incoming freshman forward
Mitch McGary and redshirt soph-
omore forward Jordan Morgan.
Beilein will again slate a true
power forward to play the four
position to kick off the season,
but unlike this year, don't expect

the plan to be scrapped midsea-
son in favor of a four-guard sys-
tem.
At 6-foot-10, McGary is taller
than Michigan's starting five-
man, Morgan, but is a natural
power forward. After spending
a year in prep school, his body is
college-ready, and he should be
able to step right in and collect
rebounds among the Big Ten's
best.
While his offense may be a
work in progress, McGary has
a nice midrange game and can
even step outside and shoot the
three. The mental aspect to his
game needs growth, but he won't
be asked to do a whole lot aside
from collecting rebounds and
setting screens. The high energy
level that he plays the game with
should help at both, and if he
can average close to10 points, 10
rebounds and a block-and-a-half
per game, Michigan will finally
have the big man it has lacked in
the Beilein era.
With his height, McGary can
easily slide over to the five if
Morgan gets into foul trouble.
With another offseason, Mor-
gan should improve on a steady
sophomore year.
The Detroit native shot an
impressive 61.9 percent from the
field but had several puzzling
point-blank-range misses. His
points (7.3) and rebounds (5.6)
may not see notable increases,
but if he can add strength and
stay out of foul trouble - some-
thing he improved upon greatly
this year - he'll be a dependable 0
option down low.
Additionally, Beilein should
finally have a bench full of low-
post options. Despite going
cold for most of conference
play, sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz still managed to shoot
a team-high 43.5 percent from
3-point range.
Last offseason, he returned
to Ann Arbor close to 35 pounds
heavier, and it showed, as he was
able to attack the rim - danger-
ous for a 6-foot-9 shooter. He'll
be highly motivated to have
another superb offseason after
his turnover ended Michigan's
season, so expect him to bulk up
even more to improve his ability
to defend the post.
The biggest improvement
Smotrycz needs to make is a
mental one. Too often, he picked
up fouls away from the ball or
basket, limiting his play time. If
he can stay out of foul trouble,
look for him to be one of the con-
ference's top sixth men.
Sophomore forward Jon Hor-
ford, who played in just nine
games before being shelved with
a foot injury, should be back at
full strength.
While he might be squeezed
out of ever seeing significant
minutes, the 6-foot-10 Horford
should prove to be a defensive
burst of energy off the bench.
In just under 11 minutes per
game this season, he notched
3.6 rebounds and a block per
game. If he can provide similar
results, Michigan can transform
from a team with almost no low-
post depth to one of the deepest
benches in the Big Ten.

Letter from the Editor
by Kaitlin Williams
ore than 40,000 students attend the University and they all
stake claim to the epithet "the leaders and the best." How could
you whittle the "champions of the west" down to just 11 Stu-
dents of the Year featured in 10 articles? With plenty of viable choices, it
wasn't easy.
Nominees were gathered via e-mail submissions and suggestions from
Michigan Daily staff members. The resulting pool of nominees was dif-
ficult to cut down to just a handful of finalists. That said, we're confident
our selection is a representative sample of the best the University has to
offer.
The students profiled include star athletes, an actress starring on Broad-
way and an engineer building equipment to shoot into the stars. Their
achievements are made more impressive when you consider that they take
classes, deal with relationship drama and juggle social lives.
For those profiled who are not seniors, we can expect more great things
in years to come. For those leaving the University this year, we get to throw
in our lot with the legacy they leave behind. And for those not tossing their
graduation caps in the air this spring, you could land on these pages next
year.

COURTESY !F CHRIS DZOMB'A
Taylor Louderman: To Broadway
by Jesse Klein
II
TIth blonde hair and bright blue eyes, Taylor Louderman looks like your
stereotypical high school cheerleader, but she hadn't ever cheered until
she landed a starring role in Bring It On: The Musical.
Louderman is currently taking a sabbatical from the University to tour the
country as Campbell, the lead role in Bring It On. To get the part, Louderman
went through a series of intense auditions at the University and then in New
York. She even nabbed the part while battling bronchitis.
"I was back in time for school the next day," Louderman said.
Louderman traded in her backpack for a suitcase and embarked on a 13-city
tour. She plays Campbell, an uppity rich girl who transfers to an inner city
school and is forced to compete against her old high school in a cheerleading
competition.
"It's insanely different," Louderman said. "It's not based on any one movie but
takes elements from each."
Louderman said she thoroughly enjoys her time on stage.
"I love work with a creative team on the production of the show," Louderman
said.
The big cities are a change for this small town girl. Growing up outside of St.
Louis had a large impact on Louderman's work ethic, she said.
"I had to drive an hour to get to rehearsals," Louderman said. "It taught me
how hard you have to work."
- It's that same drive that got her into the University's prestigious School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, a place she said is defined by its instructors.
"The professors really make the school," Louderman said.
Louderman will return to the University next year and is excited to come
back to campus. while she misses the football games, the buses and just being in
school, she said the atmosphere was the hardest thing to leave.
"I miss the family environment," Louderman said.
- "As students, it is important to be open to opportunities available to you," Shi
said. "If you take the time to find the classes that are interesting to you, you
never know when the opportunity may come about to make use of it."

Duncan Miller: The Rising Star
by Zach Bergson
hough he's too modest to admit it, Engineering junior Duncan Miller is a
rising star in the field of aerospace engineering.
Miller, who said he was "bitten by the space bug at an early age," has a
resum6 that any aerospace engineer would appreciate.
In his three years at the University, Miller has interned for Lockheed Martin
Space Systems, the NASA Langley Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory and earned
a flawless 4.0 grade point average with 18 A-pluses.
Oh, and did we mention he's one of the lead engineers for the Cubesat Inves-
tigating Atmospheric Density Response to Extreme Driving, a state of the art
satellite, which will orbit around the Earth?
But the Dearborn, Mich. native plays all of this down when you speak to him.
He says he's gotten to where he is today through tireless work and a lot of help
from his peers and mentors.
"I didn't do all of this myself," Miller said. "I get to work with some of the
smartest (University students)."
Miller added that the CADRE project has been consuming most of his free
time lately. He said the satellite project is one of the biggest student-led projects
at the University.
"CADRE will study the thermosphere in low earth orbit by sampling the ion
winds. Ultimately, this will improve orbital tracking of objects to help minimize
collisions in orbit," he said.
Though he downplays his level of importance to CADRE's success, Miller is
the only undergraduate leader of the project - the rest of the team leaders are
graduate students.
Miller said it's difficult to balance his CADRE work and his rigorous engi-
neering curriculum - he spends more than 20 hours a week designing the satel-
lite. He added that his peers are integral to his success juggling responsibilities.
"The great thing about being on a student project is that there are a bunch of
other kids who have the same dream, who are really motivated to make it hap-
pen," Miller said. "what usually happens is, if it's my midterm week, it's going
to be someone else's midterm week next week, so if they pick up the slack for me
this week and I cover for them next week ... we have each others' back."
This summer Miller will intern at SpaceX, a private aerospace company that
develops space vehicles, and his long-term plans include attending graduate
school for aerospace engineering.
Miller said he owes all of his successes - from the internships to his pres-
tigious position on the CADRE project - to the lessons he's learned from this
University.
"All of my experiences at Michigan have shown me the merits of hard work
and having strong morals and motivation, and that those things are the key to
success," Miller said. "You can't pick the lock."

or Rackham student Mohammed Tayssir Safi - hired by the Michigan
Muslim Alumni Association as the University's first Muslim chaplain in
January - listening is as much a religious duty as a line item in his job
description.
"It's an act of worship just to meet people: to talk to them, to hear them, to
listen to what they have to say so that you can better serve them," Safi said.
Safi's appointment marked the first of a Muslim chaplain among public uni-
versities. Only about 30 universities nationwide have the position.
Two months into his appointment, Safi said his job entails listening more
than anything else. He is still having first meetings with University officials,
campus religious leaders and students. Earlier this month, he held office hours
for students and he said more showed up than he could listen to.
"I didn't know that this was going to happen, but people very quickly opened
up," he said. "... I had nine students in the span of two hours that I was there, and
I couldn't meet all of them."
Safi's other responsibilities include advocating on behalf of the Muslim
Student Association, working with religious figures on campus to encourage
cooperation and tolerance, and assisting MSA with miscellaneous tasks - be it
finding a speaker or offering advice.
He said he is a conduit both to and from the University's Muslim community,
not only raising MSA's ambitions and concerns to the University but returning
to MSA with the University's thoughts and responses.
"Sometimes the University's actively concerned and hoping to help minority
communities both in faith and ethnicity, but they don't know who to contact,"
he said. "And so I'm trying to connect with people so that they know if they can't
come to me, at least I can put them in contact with the people they need."
And though he resisted credit for all the efforts he's putting in, citing Islam's
teachings of modesty, he said his intermediation seems especially important
given the high turnover rate among the Muslim campus leadership.
In April, when the president and both vice presidents of MSA graduate, the
University and other religious organizations on campus will have to rebuild
their relationships with the University's Muslim community - except for Safi.
"Next year they're going off to do what they're going to do, and now you've got
a whole new group of people that you have to interact with," he said. "And so all
those relationships that you built disappear. We hope that I'm a circuit."

L SA junior Connie Shi has all the answers.
The cellular and molecular biology major advanced to the semi-finals of the
College Jeopardy! Championship after winning a quarter final that aired Feb.
2, finishing with $19,000 in winnings.
Shi was one of 12,000 undergraduates to apply to the college version of the
popular television game show. She auditioned in New York City before being
selected as one of 15 students who would compete on the show. Shi was flown to
Culver City, Calif. for filming in January.
"You get to go with the purpose of representing your school," Shi said. "It adds
an even better dimension."
Shi said the only strategy she employed for her stint on Jeopardy! was to
"answer correctly and before others," which is the same mindset she has for
exams. Shi added that she went into the show with the goal of doing her best and
enjoying herself in the process.
"The game is so unpredictable," Shi said. "You really don't know what's going
to happen in the moment, then there's a commercial break."
Shi's win led her to compete in the semi-finals the day after the first round.
The show aired a week later on Feb. 10.
"What most people don't realize is that the filming is done all at once - so Ken
Jennings (74-time Jeopardy! winner) taped each episode one after the other."
Shi said though there was less pressure after she won the first round, she was
less confident during the second round, in which she finished third.
Shi's life went back to normal once she returned to Ann Arbor with exams to
study for and a contract of silence to uphold. Shi couldn't tell anyone - outside
of her parents, who were present in the audience - of her win.
"It was kind of fun, knowing something no one else knows," Shi said.
Keeping academics first as always, Shi didn't watch herself on television in
early February because she was in class.
As an undergraduate researcher in the University Comprehensive Cancer Cen-
ter, Shi was recently selected to be one of 17 recipients of the prestigious Thomas J. -
Bardos Science Education Award offered by the American Association for Cancer
Research. She will head to Chicago at the end of the month to participate in the
AACR annual conference.
Shi additionally volunteers at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Ann Arbor, is a
violinist in the Michigan Pops orchestra and is a staff member of the Michigan
Undergraduate Research Journal.
All in all, Shi said that her Jeopardy! experience was "plenty of excitement,"
and she offered advice to University students.
"As students, it is important to be open to opportunities available to you," Shi
said. "If you take the time to find the classes that are interesting to you, you
} never know when the opportunity may come about to make use of it."
