When graduate students at 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

decided to strike in September, 
state law was definitively not on 
their side. 

On the first day of the strike, 

the University filed an unfair 
labor practice complaint against 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
the 
union 

representing more than 2,000 
graduate 
student 
instructors 

and 
graduate 
student 
staff 

assistants, and later followed up 
with a request for a preliminary 
injunction on Sept. 14. 

Members 
of 
GEO 
went 

on strike in protest of the 
University’s fall reopening plan 
and called for more COVID-

19 protections and the right to 
work remotely for all graduate 
student instructors. They also 
demanded the diversion of funds 
from the Division of Public 
Safety and Security, a request 
the University did not grant. 

GEO 
reluctantly 
accepted 

the University’s proposal to end 
the strike because of the legal 
pressure the union was facing. 

“In the face of our power, the 

University of Michigan decided 
to lean on a nearly hundred year 
old union-busting law to sue 
their own graduate students,” 
union leaders wrote in a Sept. 16 
press release. “ … The University 
poured their immense resources 
into legal fees instead of simply 
protecting our community by 
implementing reasonable steps 
toward a safe and just pandemic 
response for all.”

Striking is one tool unions 

have at their disposal to increase 
their power when bargaining 
with employers. However, in 
Michigan, it is illegal for most 
public employees to strike under 
the 1947 Public Employment 
Relations Act. 

This ban is one of several 

pieces of legislation and court 
rulings that have restrained 
the 
power 
of 
unions 
both 

in Michigan and across the 
country.

In 
December 
2012, 
the 

Republican-controlled Michigan 
legislature 
and 
Republican 

Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 
passed 
a 

law 
cementing 
right-to-work 

legislation in Michigan. Under 
the new law, no employee could 
be required to be an official, dues-
paying member or to pay fees 
supporting the union’s collective 
bargaining. 

Unions are still required to 

represent nonmember employees, 
who continue benefiting from 
many union activities such as legal 
representation and negotiations 
with employers, often resulting in 
higher wages and better benefits. 

Amber McCann, a spokesperson 

for state Sen. Mike Shirkey, 
R-Clarklake, who supports right-
to-work legislation and voted for 
the Michigan bill in 2012, wrote 
in an email to The Michigan Daily 
that Shirkey believes workers 
should not be required to join or 
finance a union’s activities. 

“The driving force behind 

Senator 
Shirkey’s 
support 
of 

‘Freedom to Choose’ (aka RTW 
Legislation) was choice,” McCann 
wrote. “He believes unions have 
the ability to make their case for 
membership and workers have the 
ability to choose whether or not 
that membership is beneficial to 
them.”

According to Kate Andrias, 

professor at the University of 
Michigan Law School, who studies 
labor law, because this kind of 
legislation is labeled as right-to-
work, people often misunderstand 
its purpose, which she said is to 
weaken unions. 

“Right-to-work is not actually 

about a right-to-work — it doesn’t 
give anyone a job or protect 
anyone from being fired without 
cause,” Andrias said. “Rather, it 
is simply a tactic to defund and 
weaken unions. The effect of 
right-to-work laws is to weaken 
workers’ bargaining power at 
work and their influence in the 
political system.” 

The 2012 right-to-work law 

justifies 
the 
prohibition 
on 

strikes 
by 
public 
employees, 

claiming regardless of the merit 
of the controversy, they are an 
“economic waste” and that the 

state’s residents should always 
be “considered, respected and 
protected.”

Ian 
Robinson, 
president 

of 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, which represents 
non-tenure track faculty members, 
said the union lost approximately 
10 percent of revenue when they 
first felt the effects of new right-
to-work legislation. However, he 
added this is not where he thinks 
the union gets its power.

“Power doesn’t really come 

from money, at least not at the 
margins,” Robinson said. “I mean, 
you need a certain amount of 
money in a union to hire quality 
staff people to help support the 
volunteers that are really at the 
core of the union work in union 
power. If you don’t have a good 
volunteer base and a high level of 

The Washtenaw County Health 

Department issued a stay-in-place 
order for University of Michigan 
undergraduate students Tuesday 
to curb outbreaks of COVID-
19. It will take place effective 
immediately and last until Nov. 3 
at 7 a.m.

In a press release, Jimena 

Loveluck, 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health Officer, said they put the 
order in place because the situation 
has become “critical.” According 
to 
Loveluck, 
U-M-associated 

COVID-19 cases represent over 
60% of local cases.

“This order is necessary to 

reverse 
the 
current 
increase 

in cases,” Loveluck said. “We 
must continue to do what we 
can to minimize the impact on 
the broader community and to 
ensure we have the public health 
capacity to fully investigate cases 
and prevent additional spread of 
illness.”

Undergraduate students, both 

on and off-campus, must stay in 
their residence unless attending 
class, accessing dining services or 
carrying out approved work that 
cannot be done remotely. Students 
who wish to return to a primary 
residence may do so only if they 
have completed the University’s 
procedures for leaving campus 

safely.

Students 
not 
experiencing 

COVID-19 symptoms may still 
leave their residences for a variety 
of 
reasons, 
including 
voting, 

getting medication and going to 
medical appointments, attending 
class, 
participating 
in 
varsity 

sports, going to work if it cannot 
be done remotely or exercising in 
groups of no more than two people.

Under existing state orders, 

people must stay away from those 
not already in their household by 
at least six feet and wear a face 
covering when out in public or 
common areas. No visitors will 
be allowed in on or off-campus 
housing. The county emphasized 
there should be no in-person 
gatherings with people outside of 
people’s households.

According 
to 
the 
county’s 

press 
release, 
the 
University 

also will take further steps out 
of an “abundance of caution” 
to provide options for students 
and instructors such as moving 
more undergraduate courses to 
fully remote instruction for the 
remainder of the fall semester.

In a statement, Robert Ernst, 

executive director of University 
Health Service and associate vice 
president for Student Life, said 
the school was working in close 
coordination with the county.

Editor’s Note: The Michigan 

Daily has used several anonymous 
sources 
to 
report 
this 
story. 

As stated in the article, we are 
honoring our sources’ requests to 
be quoted anonymously due to fears 

of retaliation from their sorority 
houses or the greater fraternity and 
sorority life community, which is 
commonly referred to as Greek life. 

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
has 

uncovered 
a 
previously 

unreported cluster of COVID-
19 cases connected to fraternity 
and sorority life on campus 
after a party between members 
in two houses. The Daily has 

also 
obtained 
documentation 

that multiple fraternities in the 
Interfraternity Council conducted 
fall recruitment of freshmen — a 
violation of the IFC’s moratorium 
on fall rush for first-year students.

The Chi Omega sorority had 

a cluster of COVID-19 cases and 
went on lockdown after members 
of the sorority attended a joint 
party with Delta Chi, a disaffiliated 

University fraternity, according 
to four Panhellenic Association 
members. 

The Daily has obtained an email 

from University Health Service to 
Chi Omega residents about this 
cluster. The cluster is not publicly 
identified 
on 
the 
University 

dashboard.

commitment from quite a lot of 
volunteers, you can have a lot of 
money and still be very weak.” 

Kat Brausch, Rackham student 

and grievance committee co-chair 
of GEO, warned that right-to-
work laws could result in unions 
having too few members or funds 
to continue, but clarified this is not 
currently a concern for GEO. 

“Right-to-work is intended to 

set up a sort of financial death 
spiral in a way because people do 
not have to be members, fewer 
people are paying dues,” Brausch 
said. “The union has less money 
to spend on both our sort of day-
to-day activities, our collective 
bargaining, our general support 
for our members and things like 
that. And we have to put more of 
our efforts into member organizing 
to make sure that we get as many 
members as possible.” 

“But with less money, we have 

less resources to put into member 
organizing, which means that then 
there were fewer people joining the 
union and less money to put into 
organizing,” Brausch added.

LSA professor Bob King is a 

former president of United Auto 
Workers, a prominent union in 
the U.S. and Canada with more 
than 980,000 members. King said 
unions can retain members even 
when subject to right-to-work laws. 

“UAW is still able to have an 

effective voice and effective power 
to get good contracts,” King said. 
“So good contracts are what keeps 
high membership, I think. And 
so overall, unions that have that 
power in the industry or power 

to the employer, they keep high 
memberships. If they don’t have, 
or if they have less power to deliver 
the kind of contracts they want, 
then I think it impacts membership 
more.”

McCann said Shirkey’s support 

for right-to-work legislation is 
driven by the belief it would benefit 
the Michigan economy. 

“Michigan 
has 
absolutely 

experienced an economic recovery 
as a result of multiple factors, 
but the Majority Leader would 
argue that Michigan becoming 
a ‘Freedom to Choose’ state did 
factor into the decision-making for 
companies looking to Michigan to 
locate,” McCann wrote. “It was a 
policy that (made) Michigan much 
more economically competitive. 
Furthermore, union membership 
has not seen a significant loss 
of members — proving Senator 
Shirkey’s point that the union has 
the ability to make the case for the 
value of membership.”

There has long been a national 

trend toward restricting unions 
and strengthening right-to-work 
legislation. 

In 1977, the U.S. Supreme 

Court held that public sector 
union fair share fees were lawful 
and could be used for collective 
bargaining in Abood v. Detroit 
Board of Education. The ruling was 
overturned in 2018 with Janus v. 
AFSCME, making right-to-work 
the national norm. 

The 
decision 
meant 
public 

employees do not have to pay union 
fees to cover the costs of collective 
bargaining, 
undermining 
the 

laws in 22 states with “fair share” 
provisions requiring non-members 
to pay these fees. 

Michigan’s 
economy 
has 

improved since the passage of the 
right-to-work bill, but pinpointing 
the impacts of a single piece of 
legislation is a difficult task. 

Many academic studies have 

sought to evaluate the results of 
right-to-work laws, but numerous 
factors contribute to economic 
growth. While this legislation can 
help foster a more business-friendly 
environment, determining those 
effects with certainty isn’t easily 
done. 

However, some studies indicate 

adverse results in terms of union 
membership and wage growth.

According to a study by Frank 

Manzo, the policy director of 
the 
Illinois 
Economic 
Policy 

Institute, and Robert Bruno, a 
labor professor at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the 
Janus decision could reduce union 
membership among state and local 
government employees by 726,000 
people. Manzo and Bruno also 
estimated wages for that group of 
employees could fall by an average 
of 3.6%.

A different article in the Labor 

Studies Journal found that right-
to-work laws had no impact on 
employment and negatively affected 
other aspects of the economy. 

While state law was on the 

University’s side in the labor 
dispute with the graduate students, 
the union and their supporters were 
frustrated with the school’s request 
for an injunction against GEO — the 
University’s own students.

In the aftermath of the strike, 

GEO spokesperson Leah Bernardo-
Ciddio said the union felt like its 
hand had been forced.

“We are all feeling a little bit upset 

and frustrated and devastated that 
we were backed into a legal corner, 

and we had to choose between 
our demands and the future of our 
union,” Bernardo-Ciddio said.

The graduate students aren’t the 

first on campus to resort to a strike — 
or the threat of one — when seeking 
concessions from the University. In 
the spring of 2018, after a months-
long bargaining campaign, LEO 
members came close to initiating 
a work stoppage, which also 
would have violated state law. 
LEO called off the work stoppage 
when the union determined that 
the University’s bargaining team 
had started to “move in the right 
direction” at a last-ditch bargaining 
session. 

Robinson said unions have to use 

the options available to them when 
making demands on behalf of their 
members.

“The way I look at it is, over the 

years, there’s a series of promises 
that the University has made and 
not kept,” Robinson said. “Every 
now and then LEO should feel free 
to make a promise and to not keep 
a promise.” 

According to Robinson, striking 

is justified in certain circumstances.

“My view has been, it’s the law, 

but we used to have apartheid laws, 
we used to have laws against Black 
and white people using the same 
water fountains,” Robinson said. 
“There’s laws that you should obey 
because they’re morally sound and 
everybody benefits from them and 
everyone should follow them, and 
there’s laws that really ought to 
be broken because they are unjust 
laws.”

 BECCA MAHON/Daily

Ann Arbor public schools are working together to adapt a learning environment which meets new safety standards.

ADVERTISING

WMG-contact@umich.edu 

In an attempt to find a 

compromise between a COVID-
19 
safe 
environment 
and 

in-person schooling, Washtenaw 
County 
Health 
Department 

and Washtenaw Intermediate 
School District released a call to 
action on Oct. 12, emphasizing 
the 
importance 
of 
a 
joint 

community effort to bring kids 
back to schools safely. 

“We 
wanted 
to 
raise 

awareness,” 
Naomi 
Norman, 

the interim superintendent of 
Washtenaw Intermediate School 
District, said. “Our ability to 
go back to school successfully 
face-to-face 
was 
dependent 

not only on our schools having 
really strong safety protocols, 
but that as a larger community, 
as families and all the people 
who touch our families, we all 
have to be working together on 
having healthy practices so that 
we can minimize the spread of 
COVID-19.”

Ann Arbor Public Schools is 

one of the few school districts in 
Washtenaw County doing virtual 
learning. The call to action letter 
says all school communities 
have the responsibility to look 
after one another.

“Even when you feel like 

you’re in your own bubble or in 
your own space, you are part 
of a larger Washington County 
community and we have to 
count on everyone,” Norman 
said. “Every one of us matters to 
this effort.”

The letter said teachers and 

staff are missing their students 
and that there is mutual effort 
needed from both the school 
districts and the communities as 
a whole to bring students back. 
The call to action lists important 
safety 
guidelines 
to 
help 

minimize the spread of COVID-
19, such as hand washing, getting 
a flu vaccine, wearing face masks 
and practicing social distancing. 
Currently, 30 district officials, 
including the nine public school 
superintendents, have signed 
the joint call-to-action letter. 

Huron High School history 

teacher Jeff DeMoss is one of the 
many teachers who are striving 
to create a virtual community. 
He said Zoom is not conducive to 
a positive and healthy classroom 
environment.

“Creating a community for 

me relies a lot upon people 
practicing some vulnerability 
and being willing to share things 
about their identity, about their 
political 
or 
social 
beliefs,” 

DeMoss said. “When it’s on a 
screen, and people are just in 

their room frequently with their 
cameras off, students don’t feel 
safe to share.” 

AAPS has put effort into 

creating 
support 
systems 

for 
students 
and 
teachers. 

DeMoss 
said 
teachers 
went 

through weeks of professional 
development 
to 
establish 

the 
new 
virtual 
education 

proceedings. 
He 
also 
said 

students have been creating 
community through different 
clubs and organizations. 

Huron High School senior 

Aakarsh Verma said adjusting to 
online school has been difficult 
but has created a sense of 
camaraderie among students.

“Overcoming a lot of those 

technical 
difficulties 
that 

are bound to arise when you 
transition to an entirely virtual 
platform for learning,” Verma 
said. “We’ve been patient with 
our teachers and we’ve been 
helping them where we can and 
that has established a sort of 
community through the shared 
learning curve that has brought 
us together.” 

DeMoss 
said 
he 
was 

concerned that virtual learning 
affects students’ mental health.

“They are isolated,” DeMoss 

said. “But those connections are 
not able to fully be there, the 
same as if we were in-person.” 

The mental and social health 

of students are one of the main 
concerns of virtual schooling, 
but many school districts are 
facing difficult decisions on 
whether or not these social 
and 
mental 
concerns 
hold 

precedence over the concern 
of a COVID-19 outbreak in a 
school. 

When contacted for comment, 

Andrew Cluley, AAPS director 
of communications, directed 
The Michigan Daily to the 
AAPS COVID dashboard where 
AAPS highlights the metrics the 
district is looking for to bring 
students back. These metrics 
include 14 days of a downward 
trend in positive cases across 
the country, 7-20 new positive 
cases per million and less than 
3% risk rate determined by the 
MI Safe Smart Map.

The call to action says there 

needs to be a joint effort from 
the community and the school 
districts to ensure a safe school 
environment. 

“I hope to see them (schools) 

following COVID guidelines,” 
Verma said. “These are not 
normal times — we’re in the 
middle of a global pandemic. 
And we can’t act like we aren’t.”

The four students quoted in this 

article — all members of sororities 
in the Panhellenic Association 
familiar with the party and the 
outbreak in Chi Omega — spoke 
to The Daily on the condition of 
anonymity out of fear of retaliation 
from their chapter. This article 
will refer to each student by a 
pseudonym. 

Grace, who is currently living 

in a sorority house on campus, 
told The Daily that she has seen 
very few changes in fraternity 
and sorority life in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’d say like 80 percent of Greek 

life is living life as normal,” Grace 
said. “I think that people got here, 
realized what was possible and 
threw caution to the wind.”

Grace said it is hard to know 

how widespread COVID-19 is in 
fraternities and sororities because 
chapters are not forthcoming with 
their testing results.

“I think everyone knows more 

than they want to admit,” she said.

A party and an outbreak
Members of the Delta Chi 

fraternity hosted a party Sept. 19 
with dozens of members of the Chi 
Omega sorority in attendance, four 
students with knowledge of the 
event told The Daily. These four 
students include one student in 
Chi Omega who told The Daily that 
she chose not to attend the party 
and three Panhellenic members 
who have knowledge of the event 
but wished to keep their chapter 
affiliation anonymous. 

UHS sent a letter addressed to 

residents of Chi Omega confirming 
that a cluster had been identified 
in the house Sept. 24. The letter, 
obtained by The Daily, instructed 
residents to take part in voluntary 
testing. 

“As you may be aware, a cluster 

of COVID-19 cases has been 
identified within your sorority,” 
the UHS email read. “On the 
advice of the Washtenaw County 
Health Department, and out of 
an abundance of caution, you are 
asked to test for COVID-19 within 
the next 48 hours.”

The Daily asked the University’s 

Office of Public Affairs if Chi Omega 
experienced a cluster in mid-
September. The Daily also asked 
for the total number of clusters 
and cases connected to University 
FSL. University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen did not answer these 
questions in an email to The Daily 
Wednesday morning.

When 
asked 
the 
same 

questions, 
Susan 
Ringler-

Cerniglia, communications and 
health promotion administrator 
of Washtenaw County Health 
Department, wrote in an email to 
The Daily Wednesday morning that 
she did not know the answers. She 
said the county health department 
does not collect specific data on 
FSL.

“At the time of this cluster, 

there were several off-campus 
residences with cases/clusters,” 
 

Ringler-Cerniglia wrote. 

Approximately 
15 
members 

of the Chi Omega sorority tested 
positive for COVID-19 in the 
days that followed the party with 
Delta Chi, multiple Panhellenic 
Association members told The 
Daily. Most of the members who 
tested positive had attended the 

Delta Chi fraternity party, they 
said. 

The 
University 
publishes 

notification letters of confirmed 
cases in residence halls and 
campus buildings online. Cases 
in FSL are not individually noted 
in publicly available data on the 
University’s dashboard, though 
they are included in the total 
case count. This means the total 
number of cases specifically in FSL 
is unknown to the public.

Other universities, such as 

the University of Washington 
and 
University 
of 
Southern 

California, 
publicly 
announce 

clusters within FSL. Ohio State 
University President Kristina M. 
Johnson told The Lantern, the 
campus newspaper, the number 
of fraternity and sorority houses 
under mandatory quarantine, but 
an OSU spokesperson would not 
confirm the names of organizations 
to protect members’ privacy.

The 
University 
of 
North 

Carolina at Chapel Hill publicly 
alerted students to all clusters, 
including naming specific FSL 
houses. UNC Chapel Hill moved to 
all-remote instruction after a series 
of clusters emerged, including 
some in its FSL houses. Colleges 
around the country continue to 
grapple with outbreaks in FSL. 

In her Wednesday email to The 

Daily, Broekhuizen wrote that the 
University does not publicly post 
notifications for clusters in off-
campus housing such as fraternity 
and sorority houses “for a variety 
of reasons; one of which is for the 
respect of student privacy.” She 
noted that the University does 
not own or operate fraternity and 
sorority housing.

The University of Washington, 

the 
University 
of 
Southern 

California and UNC Chapel Hill do 
not own their campus’s fraternity 
and sorority houses. Ohio State 
University 
manages 
some 

fraternity and sorority houses but 
not others. 

While the University does not 

publicly identify cases in FSL, 
Ringler-Cerniglia 
said 
anyone 

involved in a cluster is contacted 
directly. 

“Separating out case numbers by 

location or house may be identifying 
in some instances, and we wouldn’t 
necessarily 
recommend 
it 
as 

useful given the current process,” 
Ringler-Cerniglia said. “Whether 
a total number of FSL cases can be 
provided is really a question for the 
university.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, 

more than 880 positive cases of 
COVID-19 have been traced back 
to the University since the start 
of the semester, according to the 
school’s 
COVID-19 
dashboard. 

According to Washtenaw County 
data, 18- to 22-year-olds account 
for 80 percent of confirmed cases 
in the county from Sept. 24 to Oct. 
7. 

Grace said there is a tendency 

among members to treat cases in 
FSL as an internal problem, rather 
than something that can impact 
the surrounding community.

“It’s not like we’re living in 

this little bubble off South U,” 
Grace said. “Greek life kids go into 
local establishments and they’re 
interacting with people outside of 
their own little bubbles every day. 
That’s when it gets really scary, 
when they break their bubble and it 
just starts to spread.”

According to a Sept. 24 notice 

posted to the University dashboard, 
“off-campus, congregate housing” 
accounted for a rise in cases in 
September. Between Aug. 21 and 
Oct. 9, on-campus residence halls 
have reported more than 200 cases 
and have dealt with at least nine 
clusters. 

Grace said she knew living in a 

house with dozens of other girls 
meant she had an increased chance 
of contracting the virus. However, 
she was not prepared for the risks 
she faced as her housemates and 
others in FSL continued to party.

“I just didn’t think that when we 

got here the level of socialization 
would be as intense as it was. From 
day one, girls were automatically 
diving into frat basements,” Grace 
said.

The IFC and the Panhellenic 

Association, 
the 
governing 

bodies of some of the University’s 
fraternities and sororities, decided 
to suspend all social events for the 
fall semester in a statement from 
the two groups at the end of July. 

“We cannot ignore the broader 

implications and responsibilities 
of being a member of Fraternity 
& 
Sorority 
Life 
during 
this 

unprecedented time,” the IFC 
and 
Panhellenic 
Association 

statement reads. “We must also 
be mindful of how the virus 
has disproportionately affected 
communities of color, and do our 
part to work against this inequity.”

Not wanting to be subject 

to 
University 
policies, 
the 

University’s chapter of Delta Chi 
left the IFC voluntarily in the 
fall of 2018. Delta Chi and five 
other fraternities formed its own 
governing body called the Ann 
Arbor Interfraternity Council. 

The Panhellenic Association 

prohibits sororities from attending 
social events with fraternities that 
are “expelled from or temporarily 
suspended from” the IFC.

The Delta Chi headquarters 

placed a “Cease of Operations” 
on the University’s chapter in 
October 2019, according to the 
IFC’s website. It is unclear why the 
chapter was reprimanded. 

Broekhuizen wrote Wednesday 

afternoon that the University’s 
Office of Fraternity and Sorority 
Life is aware that some chapters 
have “disregarded and violated 
public 
health 
and 
safety 

guidelines.” She said two IFC 
chapters are on probation, one 
has lost University recognition 
and “several” others have received 
educational sanctions.

“Safety 
is 
a 
community 

responsibility and students ARE 
holding one another accountable 
by using the mechanisms the 
university has in place to report 
concerns and share evidence, and 
to submit formal complaints,” 
Broekhuizen 
said. 
“... 
Many 

fraternities and sororities have 
had no challenges honoring the 
public 
health 
guidelines 
and 

expectations.”

The 
IFC, 
the 
Panhellenic 

Association and the University’s 
chapters of Delta Chi and Chi 
Omega did not respond to multiple 
requests for comment.

The Daily talked to more than 

a dozen people in the course of 
reporting this article and found 
no evidence that any fraternity 
and sorority organizations in the 
Multicultural Greek Council or the 
National Panhellenic Council, the 
governing body for the University’s 
Black fraternities and sororities, 

engaged 
in 
fall 
recruitment 

of freshmen students or have 
outbreaks of COVID-19. 

Fraternities recruit against 

‘U’ policy again

A freshman recruit in Delta Chi 

had tested positive for COVID-19 
before the Sept. 19 party, Emma 
and Grace told The Daily. Because 
Delta Chi is disaffiliated from the 
University and is not subject to 
University policies, the fraternity 
can recruit freshmen members this 
semester. 

For fraternities and sororities 

affiliated with the University, IFC 
regulations prohibit them from 
taking in new freshmen members 
until the winter semester. Last 
fall, The Daily reported that at 
least eight IFC fraternities violated 
this policy by recruiting freshmen 
members the first semester that 
the policy went into effect.

Again this fall, The Daily 

confirmed 
that 
at 
least 
five 

University-affiliated 
fraternities 

conducted 
freshmen 
rush. 

The Daily reached out to two 
freshmen who confirmed that 
they participated in fraternity fall 
recruitment, but both declined to 
comment further.

When asked how the University 

is enforcing its policy, Broekhuizen 
wrote that “a number of chapters 
are recruiting eligible students to 
learn more about their chapters 
which is in compliance with the 
university’s 
policy 
related 
to 

recruitment.” 

Chapters 
in 
the 
IFC 
and 

Panhellenic 
Association 
are 

allowed 
to 
host 
in-person 

recruitment events of eligible 
students — all students that have 
completed at least 12 credits at 
the University — as long as they 
follow public health guidelines and 
University COVID-19 policies.

But members of three different 

University-affiliated 
fraternities 

used language explicitly targeting 
freshmen students in posts to 
Facebook 
groups 
meant 
for 

recruitment. The Daily reviewed 
the posts in some of these groups. 

“Now, as a high school graduate 

headed for Michigan, I’m sure 
you’ve all heard of welcome week,” 
a June 25 post in one fraternity’s fall 
recruitment group reads. “Frankly, 
words don’t do it justice. I hope you 
are ready for fourteen days straight 
of drinking, f---ing, and to keep it 
short, doing whatever the f--- you 
want.”

Some IFC-affiliated fraternities 

create PowerPoint presentations of 
their new recruits, called pledges, 
after 
recruitment 
concludes. 

Several sorority members provided 
The 
Daily 
with 
PowerPoints 

from three IFC fraternities sent 
by fraternity brothers to various 
Panhellenic 
sororities. 
The 

PowerPoints created for the fall 
2020 recruitment cycle featured 
mostly first-year students.

Grace said she was worried 

freshmen rush would contribute to 
the spread of COVID-19, especially 
because most rush events are in 
person.

“These pledges are rushing 

multiple frats, so they’re going 
everywhere,” Grace said.

Dealing with an outbreak
Broekhuizen 
wrote 
that 

the University works with the 
county health department, the 
four 
fraternity 
and 
sorority 

student 
governing 
councils 

and 
each 
chapter’s 
national 

headquarters 
to 
facilitate 

COVID-19 communications and 
planning. 
These 
organizations 

also collaborate to handle positive 
cases and to address public health 
violations. 

According 
to 
Broekhuizen, 

chapters were asked to submit 
their quarantine and isolation 
plans to the University for review. 
When cases are identified among 
off-campus students, Broekhuizen 
wrote that the University offers 
“broader 
asymptomatic 
testing 

of individuals living in those 
locations” 
and 
directs 
these 

students to quarantine.

Some fraternity and sorority 

houses have developed plans to 
deal with potential coronavirus 
cases, 
including 
designating 

specific bedrooms and bathrooms 
to be used for quarantine purposes. 

Engineering sophomore Sydney 

Swider is a member of Alpha Chi 
Omega. She said she thought her 
house was doing the best it could 
to quarantine and isolate given the 
circumstances of communal living.

“With our shared living spaces, 

we’re more at risk than people 
living in houses by themselves or 
with two other people, but overall 
I think they’re taking a lot of 
measures,” Swider said. “If anyone 
has been in contact with a positive 
case, they’re quarantining or they 
have to get out of the house.”

Swider said the girls in Alpha 

Chi Omega have to report their 
test results to their self-elected 
House Corps, made up of two 
other members of the sorority. 
According to Swider, the House 
Corps then reports these results to 
the University.

The Daily reached out to 13 

other 
fraternity 
and 
sorority 

organizations asking about their 
COVID-19 protocols, but none 
responded.

In 
contrast 
to 
Swider’s 

experience at Alpha Chi Omega, 
students told The Daily that Chi 
Omega’s plan was insufficient 
when a large portion of the house 
had been exposed to the virus. The 
Chi Omega house set aside four 
double bedrooms in case members 
needed 
to 
isolate 
themselves, 

multiple Panhellenic Association 
Members told The Daily.

“That was under the pretense 

that there would only be a few 
positive cases in the house at a 
time,” Grace said. “They did not 
expect there to be 15 cases all at 
once.” 

Rebecca echoed the sentiment 

that when cases actually broke out, 
the plan in place was not enough. 

“There wasn’t a plan B in case 

there were more than eight girls 
who got COVID,” Rebecca said. 

Ringler-Cerniglia wrote that 

some fraternity and sorority houses 
were “initially less cooperative 
than others” in working with the 
county health department.

“Often the biggest question for 

us is whether a particular house is 
fully cooperating (i.e. responding 
promptly to investigators and 
following all guidance),” Ringler-
Cerniglia wrote.

According to Ringler-Cerniglia, 

the county health officer has the 
authority 
to 
issue 
quarantine 

orders to specific houses, which 
happened with 25 fraternity and 
sorority houses at Michigan State 
University in Ingham County. 
She said Washtenaw County has 
not issued any quarantine orders 
related to the University.

The entire Chi Omega house 

eventually went into a “lockdown” 
for 14 days, according to Grace, 
Emma, Rebecca and Emily, a Chi 
Omega member. The girls said 
they did not know which authority 
required the lockdown. 

The UHS email to Chi Omega 

residents instructing them to 
perform testing came five days 
after the party. Emma said that the 
delayed response may have led to 
greater transmission of the virus. 

“It was a few days, but those few 

days when you contract COVID 
are your most contagious days, 
and I think that’s why it’s spread so 
quickly,” Emma said.

The University provided self-

administered nasal swab testing 
for up to 1,500 FSL members in 
the first three weeks of September. 
Broekhuizen 
did 
not 
offer 

details on how many fraternity 
and sorority members chose to 
participate in this testing program.

Some of Swider’s friends tried 

these 
self-administered 
tests. 

When they went to turn in these 
tests at the dropbox, Swider said 
the drop-off location seemed out-
of-service.

“There were over 100 tests in 

that thing,” Swider said. “That 
made me really not trust (the 
University).”

Symptomatic students and close 

contacts of positive individuals can 
get tested through UHS. Other 
students who wish to get a test 
through the University have to sign 
up and be chosen for the voluntary 
surveillance 
testing 
program, 

leading many students to test off-
campus for reasons of access and 
convenience. 

Swider said she signed up to get 

tested through the University and 
went to the testing center three 
times at the beginning of the year, 
but no tests were available each 
time she went. 

Swider said many people in her 

house and in her FSL circles are 
opting to test off campus because 
they 
find 
on-campus 
options 

inadequate. 

“I’m at urgent care right now, 

and there’s almost 30 people 
here,” Swider said during a phone 
interview. “Most of them are in 
Greek life that I know from other 
houses.”

After pressure from the campus 

community, the University added 
off-campus tests to its dashboard 
at the end of September, more 
than doubling the total number 
of recorded cases. These cases 
were previously known to the 
University. 

When 
interviewed 
in 

September, Ringler-Cerniglia said 
many of these off-campus cases 
were also discovered through 
rapid antigen testing. She told The 
Daily that these rapid tests are 
unreliable.

“Let’s say they’re using this to 

justify going to a gathering. So I 
go and get my rapid test, and I go 
to a party,” Ringler-Cerniglia said. 
“We’d be highly concerned that 
that could be a false negative.”

While 
detailed 
COVID-19 

statistics for FSL are not readily 
available to the public, Grace said 
she would not consider Chi Omega 
an outlier.

“This is going to get really bad. 

But the thing is, I don’t know how 
much will be revealed,” Grace said.

CLUSTER
From Page 1

“The 
university 
has 
been 

working closely with the Health 
Department all along in response 
to the pandemic and supports this 
decision to issue this stay at home 
order,” Ernst said. “This action is 
intended to reduce the strain on 
our capacities for contact tracing 
and 
quarantine 
and 
isolation 

housing. Many individuals and off-
campus residences are cooperating 
fully, and we hope this additional 
guidance 
on 
limiting 
social 

activities reverses the trend of 
increased cases related to social 
gatherings.”

According to the county press 

release, the stay-in-place order is 
not the same as a quarantine order. 

“During the stay in place order, 

official and essential activities are 
allowable when carried out using 
COVID-19 prevention measures 
including wearing face coverings, 
social distancing and frequent 
hand cleaning,” the press release 
reads. “While this order allows 
students to work and participate in 
official activities with preventive 
measures in place, it also limits 
the 
impact 
of 
exposures 
on 

local businesses, workers and 
community members.”

This comes amid a spike in cases 

on campus and a corresponding 
jump in the use of quarantine and 
isolation housing. In the first two 
weeks of October, people between 
the ages of 18 and 22 accounted 
for nearly two-thirds of cases in 
Washtenaw County. 

As of Tuesday morning, there 

have been nearly 1,200 COVID-19 
cases on campus since the start of 
the fall semester and quarantine 
occupancy at 52.8%. On Saturday, 
the 
University 
announced 
it 

would begin to house students 
in quarantine and isolation in 
Northwood Apartments buildings 
with regular residents because all 
designated rooms are occupied. 

Washtenaw 
County 
issued 

orders on Oct. 7 limiting indoor 
gatherings to 10 people and outdoor 
events to 25. According to the order, 
the restrictions will remain in 
place until it is “determined by the 
Washtenaw County Health Officer 
that the threat to the public’s health 
and lives is no longer present.”

In early October, the University 

released criteria for reevaluating 
campus operations during the 
pandemic. There is “no one 
number” that will prompt the 

University to change its current 
plans, but there are a variety 
of metrics that would lead to 
the 
“consideration 
of 
further 

action,” according to the Campus 
Blueprint. These triggers include 
five consecutive days of COVID-19 
test positivity rates above 20%, a 
cluster of over 100 contacts, more 
than 70 new cases per million in 
Washtenaw county, if quarantine 
and isolation housing is estimated 
to reach full capacity in the next 14 
days or 80% of the beds are filled, 
among other criteria.

By Oct. 5, the University had 

triggered two of its metrics when 
there were five days of sustained 
increases in infections among 
University students and staff, and 
when Washtenaw county exceeded 
70 new cases per million. 

On Saturday, all residents of 

the Mary Markley Residence Hall 
were told to follow enhanced social 
distancing for two weeks after 
17 new cases were confirmed in 
the building. Despite the orders, 
no further criteria were met, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald told The Daily on 
Sunday. 

A 
notice 
sent 
to 
Markley 

residents over the weekend said the 

new guidelines were put in place 
because of “the high prevalence of 
cases in Markley and the lack of 
cooperation from a high proportion 
of residents.” Additional protocols 
include not attending in-person 
classes and only leaving the dorm 
room if necessary. 

The Campus Blueprint website 

says mitigation responses are 
currently targeted at the source 
of the outbreak, such as enhanced 
social 
distancing 
in 
Markley. 

However, broader, campus-wide 
changes might be warranted if 
enough metrics are crossed. 

“Tools and enhanced mitigation 

measures could include, but are 
not limited to, entrance screening 
enforcement, 
restriction 
of 

extracurricular activities, travel, 
gatherings, 
the 
suspension 
of 

in-person classes, or even the 
closure of residence halls,” the 
website reads. 

More than 360 cases have been 

confirmed in the residence halls 
from Aug. 21 to Oct. 17, according 
to the dashboard. More than ten 
clusters have been identified in 
the residence halls since move-in, 
many in the last two weeks.

The Daily confirmed one cluster 

in a sorority house following a party 
with members of a disaffiliated 

fraternity, as some in Fraternity & 
Sorority Life continue to party and 
recruit freshmen.

Chief Health Officer Preeti 

Malani said in the weekly COVID-
19 briefing on Friday that the 
current rate of students going 
into quarantine housing is “not 
sustainable” and the University 
will “go through it within a couple 
weeks.”

Especially 
towards 
the 

beginning of the semester, students 
sent to U-M quarantine housing 
voiced concerns about unsanitary 
conditions, lack of communication 
and confusing protocol. Many 
students are getting tested at off-
campus sites, some to avoid being 
sent to U-M quarantine spaces and 
others out of reasons of access and 
convenience.

When the University added 

off-campus testing counts to the 
dashboard in late September, the 
number of confirmed cases more 
than doubled.

Symptomatic individuals and 

those who’ve been in close contact 
with a positive case are eligible for 
testing through University Health 
Service. Others have to sign up and 
be chosen randomly through the 
weekly symptomatic surveillance 
testing 
program, 
leading 
to 

criticism 
from 
community 

members and experts of the 
University’s testing plans.

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, the union which 
represents more than 2,000 of 
the University’s Graduate Student 
Instructors, went on strike in 
September 
in 
protest 
of 
the 

University’s reopening plan. Facing 
legal pressure from the University, 
GEO accepted the University’s 
proposal and ended its strike after 
two weeks. 

Many resident advisers and 

some student dining hall staff also 
staged labor actions to demand 
safer working conditions. Resident 
advisers accepted the University’s 
deal soon after the GEO strike 
ended, but resident advisers and 
MDining staff continue to voice 
health and safety concerns. 

The Faculty Senate passed a vote 

of no confidence in President Mark 
Schlissel’s leadership but failed 
to pass a vote of confidence in the 
University’s fall reopening plan.

The University is expected to 

announce its plans for the winter 
semester by Nov. 1.

From Page 1


Democratic 
presidential 

nominee and former Vice 
President Joe Biden spoke 
in Detroit with U.S. Senator 
Gary 
Peters, 
D-Mich., 
to 

supporters 
in 
their 
cars 

Friday night: a little more 
than two weeks before the 
general election

Peters, who is also up for 

re-election this November, 
said he is excited to have 
Biden 
back 
in 
Michigan 

and 
reminded 
attendees 

about 
Biden’s 
work 
for 

Detroit during the Obama 
administration, 
referencing 

his success in public office.

“We are so happy that he’s 

right back here in Michigan,” 
Peters said. “Right here in 
Detroit, we know that Joe 
cares about this state and we 
know because he has been 
here before, and he’s been 
here when we need him.”

Peters 
criticized 
the 

national Republican Party 
leadership in regards to their 
handling of the pandemic. He 
told the drive-in crowd that 
Biden would lead the nation 
with a more comprehensive 
pandemic plan.

“President Trump does not 

know how to lead, and we 
need a president that leads, 
not tweets,” Peters said. 

Peters discussed the 2008 

financial crisis, which he 
said Biden played a role 
in mitigating for everyday 
Americans, and said Biden 
would advocate for people 
instead of corporations.

“There were people that 

said, let them go bankrupt, 
let them go away,” Peters 

said. “Joe Biden said no, I 
will stand with American 
workers, (and he) will always 
stand with them to make 
sure 
that 
they 
have 
the 

opportunity to be successful 
... He has stood with us in 
the past, he will stand with 
us in the future and that’s 
why we will elect him the 
next president of the United 
States.”

American 
Federation 
of 

Teachers 
member 
Everett 

Whitfield, 
a 
teacher 
at 

Thirkell Elementary School 
in Detroit, joined Peters. 
Whitfield 
said 
he 
voted 

absentee in support of Biden 
just before taking the stage.

“Joe Biden is the leader we 

can trust,” Whitfield said. 
“He has shown compassion 
and to others in various ways. 
Regardless of the party line, 
he shows that he cares, (and 
reflects) our precise history 
of working with people of 
color.”

Biden took the stage after 

checking out a couple of cars 
gathered around the stage. 
Biden told supporters that 
he loved cars and that he 
believed in Motor City.

“I’ve always believed in 

Michigan,” Biden said. “We 
have the finest auto workers 
in the world here in Michigan. 
That’s not hyperbole. That’s a 
fact.”

Biden 
emphasized 
the 

need for equity in the nation, 
particularly for communities 
of color in Detroit. 

“We 
need 
America’s 

leadership to seek deescalate 
tensions over the lines of 
communications to bring us 
back together again, to heal,” 
Biden said. “As President, 
that’s precisely what I’ll do.”

Biden said he is running 

to represent all Americans 
as president and that he will 
work together with others in 
order to enact change. 

“Today, trust is heavy, 

hope seems elusive, instead 
of healing, we’re being ripped 
apart,” Biden said. “I refuse 
to let that happen. We need 
to revive a spirit of being 
able to work together with 
one another. I’m here to tell 
you it can happen again, 
and that it must happen if 
we’re going to get anything 
done. I’m running as a proud 
Democrat, but I will govern 
as an American president.”

According 
to 
Michigan 

Deputy 
Communications 

Director John Grandy, in 
Michigan, city and township 
clerks have distributed 2.8 
million absentee ballots to 
voters. More than 1.2 million 
ballots have already been 
sent in. Clerks in a record 
number of cities, including 
Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Flint, 
Grand Rapids and Lansing, 
have added weekend and 
evening 
hours. 
These 

additional hours will be used 
to expand access and raise 
awareness of early voting, 
which is available to all 
Michigan voters for the first 
time in a general election.

On campus, the city set 

up a satellite clerk’s office in 
the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art for students 
to register to vote, vote early 
and return absentee ballots. 
Students on North Campus 
can return absentee ballots at 
Fire Station Number 5.

As of Friday, more than one 

thousand cases of COVID-19 
have been confirmed since 
move-in 
and 
quarantine 

housing is at 46% capacity, 
according to the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
COVID-19 

dashboard. This comes less 
than two months after move-
in and the start of classes. 

During move-in, resident 

advisers and students living 
in University housing raised 
concerns 
that 
University 

Housing 
was 
not 
taking 

enough 
precautions 
to 

protect 
their 
residents. 

Members 
of 
ResStaff 

went on strike and called 
upon 
the 
University 
for 

better personal protective 
equipment and enforcement 
of Housing policies.

There has also been a 

city-wide 
impact, 
with 

Washtenaw County Health 
Department reporting the 
possibility of exposure at 
two Ann Arbor restaurants, 
Brown Jug Restaurant and 
Chapala Mexican Restaurant 
earlier this week.

Washtenaw 
County 

COVID-19 
cases 
also 

crossed University metrics 
for reevaluation of campus 
operations 
earlier 
this 

month. 
These 
metrics 

include 
exceeding 
five 

days of increases in new 
infections using a seven-
day average and more than 
70 new cases per million. 
Meeting these metrics could 
prompt “further responses 
and 
strategies 
regarding 

campus operations during 
the COVID-19 pandemic,” 
according to Michigan News. 
In-person classes are still 
being held, though 70% of 
University coursework has 
been online since the start of 
the school year. 

During the University’s 

weekly COVID-19 briefing 
Friday, Chief Health Officer 
Preeti 
Malani 
said 
the 

current 
rate 
of 
students 

entering 
quarantine 
or 

isolation housing is “not 
sustainable” for the rest 
of the semester. According 
to Malani, this rise could 
prompt a change in the 
University’s 
current 
plan 

for a hybrid semester if 
quarantine housing fills to 
capacity. 

“This is very concerning 

— in the last week, there’s 
been a very robust increase 
in these numbers and I know 
many people are following 
them on the COVID tracker,” 

Malani said. “There still is 
plenty of housing available, 
but at the current rate, we 
will go through it within a 
couple weeks.”

When 
asked 
whether 

quarantine 
housing 

is 
projected 
to 
reach 

capacity 
in 
two 
weeks, 

University 
spokesperson 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
directed 

The Michigan Daily to the 
COVID-19 
dashboard 
and 

said the number of students 
in 
quarantine 
housing 

continues to grow as more 
positive cases are revealed.

“Quarantine and isolation 

housing 
is 
running 
at 

46 
percent 
of 
capacity,” 

Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“As 

you may recall, we have 
600 
rooms 
reserved 
for 

isolation 
and 
quarantine. 

It’s clear from the graph 
that the numbers have been 
increasing 
steadily 
since 

about Oct. 9.”

Fitzgerald did not confirm 

whether “not sustainable” 
meant 
that 
quarantine 

housing 
was 
projected 

to reach capacity in two 
weeks, 
instead 
echoing 

Malani’s point that students 
need to practice enhanced 
prevention 
measures 
in 

order to slow the spread. 

“It’s critical that each 

one of us act as if we are 
contagious 
by 
wearing 

masks, gathering only in 
small groups, maintaining 
social 
distancing 
and 

following 
public 
health 

guidance,” Fitzgerald wrote. 

Quarantine and isolation 

housing saw an average of 51 
students check in between 
Oct. 
13-15, 
Fitzgerald 

confirmed. 

LSA 
freshman 
Emma 

Dwoskin 
said 
she 
is 

concerned about the lack 
of 
testing 
taking 
place, 

especially 
for 
freshmen 

living in residence halls.

“If there’s 1,000 cases, 

there’s probably four times 
as much because they’re 
not testing us, which is very 
alarming and concerning,” 
Dwoskin 
said. 
“I’m 
sure 

so 
many 
people 
are 

asymptomatic that it would 
be really beneficial to just be 
testing us.”

According 
to 
the 

dashboard, as of Oct. 16, 
quarantine 
and 
isolation 

occupancy is at 46.2%. If a 
student living in a residence 
hall 
tests 
positive 
for 

COVID-19, they are required 
to 
either 
quarantine 
or 

isolate on North Campus or 
return to their permanent 
residence. They may also 
choose to book a room at a 
local hotel. 

Since move-in, there have 

been nine clusters identified 

in the residence halls. The 
first cluster was reported 
in South Quad Residence 
Hall on Sept. 17. The most 
recent cluster was identified 
in Mary Markley Residence 
Hall on Oct. 13.

In 
a 
recent 
interview 

with The Michigan Daily, 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
discussed 

University Health Services 
increasing 
their 
testing 

capacity.

“We’re telling (UHS) to 

ease up because we want 
students 
to 
use 
UHS,” 

Schlissel said. “It’s free, it’s 
convenient, there’s a one-
day turnaround time, and 
we can work with students 
immediately 
when 
they 

get a positive result to help 
assure their health and to 
make sure it doesn’t spread 
to others, so we’re going to 
have the UHS folks be a little 
more relaxed.” 

Dwoskin said she was 

aware that UHS is providing 
more 
tests 
but 
became 

concerned when she was 
unable to receive one, even 
with cases on her dorm floor. 

“(The University) said that 

UHS would start allowing 
testing to anyone who wants 
it, and then I called UHS, 
and they were not aware of 
this and were not able to give 
a test just if you want it, only 
if you’re extremely exposed,” 
Dwoskin said. 

As of Friday, 322 positive 

cases have been confirmed 
in the past 14 days, according 
to the dashboard. 2.3% of 
tests administered since Oct. 
11 have returned as positive 
for COVID-19. Additionally, 
142 students are still in 
quarantine, meaning they 
have either been exposed to 
the virus or are still waiting 
for test results.

Members of the campus 

community with symptoms 
should isolate and contact 
University Health Service 
at 734-764-8320 for a free 
COVID-19 
test. 
People 

with mild symptoms can 
use the University’s online 
assessment to initiate the 
testing process.

Students who test positive 

for COVID-19 after visiting 
an off-campus testing site 
should 
report 
their 
case 

here. 

The University plans to 

reach a decision about the 
winter semester by Nov. 1.

MDining workers speak 
out after almost striking

Employees criticize working conditions in dining halls

LSA senior Mak Guenther, 

who had been employed by 
MDining since her freshman 
year and was working in Mosher-
Jordan dining hall this year, quit 
her job three weeks ago. 

According 
to 
Guenther, 

Mosher-Jordan 
was 
getting 

1,000 more students than other 
dining halls. When Guenther 
asked her management and 
MDining administrators about 
efforts being made to mitigate 
this influx of students, she 
said she only got vague to no 
responses and saw no change.

“It was like pulling teeth to 

get answers,” Guenther said. “I 
had to let it go because of how 
horrible the response has been.” 

Guenther said quitting was 

the best thing she could do 
for the strike efforts because 
she made it clear that she was 
leaving due to what she felt were 
unsafe working conditions.

“Immediate managers were 

really great and it felt like 
they were on our side and they 
were also trying to get the 
answers for us,” Guenther said. 
“But from the wider dining 
administration, 
(I 
felt) 
just 

absolutely undervalued, very 
taken advantage of and just 
completely disrespected after 
sending in questions over and 
over and over again and never 
getting answers back.”

Guenther 
isn’t 
alone 
in 

raising concern over MDining. 
Members 
of 
MDining 
had 

planned a walkout due to these 
concerns in solidarity with the 
September 
graduate 
student 

and resident adviser strikes. 
The walkout was postponed and 
changed to a work “slow down” 
out of fear of retaliation. 

Despite this action, student 

workers said they still feel 
unheard 
by 
administrators 

and will continue to push for 

changes in their workplace. 
With the dining halls open, 
MDining 
workers 
complete 

shifts in-person, which they say 
elevates the need for a response 
to 
their 
pandemic-related 

concerns.

LSA senior Nik Von Seggern, 

who also worked in Mosher-
Jordan dining, took a break 
from working due to what she 
also felt were unsafe conditions. 

According to Von Seggern, 

the workers were not provided 
with disposable masks as they 
had been told they would be. 
She said they had to use the 
University-provided 
cloth 

masks which some MDining 
workers felt were inadequate.

Though there is a sick bank 

for workers to get paid sick 
leave, Von Seggern said many 
student workers used this bank 
back in March.

“When we were all laid 

off, most workers took their 
sick bank,” Von Seggern said. 
“Now, when we come back, the 
pandemic is arguably worse 
than what it was, or we know 
more about it than what we did 
— there’s no sick bank.”

Student MDining workers 

have been circulating a petition 
demanding increased workplace 
protections that has garnered 
more than 450 signatures at the 
time of publication. 

The 
petition 
calls 
for 

more testing, paid sick leave, 
severance pay for the remainder 
of the academic year if dining 
halls 
were 
to 
close 
again, 

transparent 
contact 
tracing, 

adequate 
sanitation 
and 

personal protective equipment 
and 
consistent 
COVID-19 

policies for all units.

Steve 
Mangan, 
senior 

director of Michigan Dining, 
said disposable masks would be 
available for any worker who 
didn’t have one in an email sent 
Wednesday to MDining student 
staff and obtained by The 

Michigan Daily.

According to Mangan’s email, 

there is a one-time sick bank 
of up to 80 hours of paid leave 
offered for MDining workers. 
He 
addressed 
that 
many 

students may have used this 
bank in March and April, and 
he said that it is not available for 
employees hired after June 7.

“For those student employees 

concerned with our attendance 
policy, our philosophy of ‘don’t 
come to work if you are sick’ 
is still the guiding principle,” 
Mangan wrote. “Any absence 
related to COVID (going for 
a test, required quarantine/ 
isolation, etc.) will continue to be 
excused with no repercussions.”

In an email to The Daily, 

Mangan 
said 
if 
student 

employees used up all of their 
eligible paid time off, there is 
no further paid time off unless 
that employee meets the criteria 
of the Michigan Paid Medical 
Leave Act.

According 
to 
this 
act, 

employees 
may 
take 
paid 

medical leave for situations such 
as physical or mental illness 
or injury to the employee or a 
family member and preventative 
care for the employee or a family 
member. Paid medical leave is 
accrued at one hour for every 35 
actual hours worked. 

Public Policy senior Nora 

Hilgart-Griff, who works at 
the Blue Cafe in East Quad 
Residence Hall, is in her third 
year of working with MDining. 
Employees in her unit wrote 
an 
email 
to 
management 

citing concerns about COVID-
19 screening before shifts, 
access to personal protective 
equipment and being able to 
take off work due to COVID-
19 related concerns without 
consequence.

Amid pandemic, students 
pursue passion projects

While 
the 
pandemic 

brought restrictions on social 
interactions, it also provided 
time for students to explore 
their passions. During the past 
six months, some University 
of Michigan students tried 
their hand at new projects and 
even started their own small 
businesses.

As the pandemic negatively 

affects the mental wellbeing 
of many young people, recent 
University 
alumni 
Maggie 

Li and LSA senior Emily 
Serhan created an app called 
“Nois” to facilitate mental 
health screening. The app 
uses artificial intelligence to 
assess people’s responses to 
a questionnaire and identify 
their mental health condition.

Afterward, the app also 

connects 
users 
with 
local 

psychiatrists 
for 
further 

treatment. 

“What this app does is 

revolutionize the process from 
diagnosis to treatment,” Li 
said. “I feel like we’ve created 
such a cool, viable product, 
and even if it doesn’t end up 
blowing up, at least a few 
people can get something out 
of it.”

Business 
junior 
Michael 

Sikand started a multimedia 
platform. His business Our 
Future consists of a podcast, 
a career-series, a newsletter 
and a merchandise line. In 
an attempt to bridge the gap 
between CEOs and college 
students, he publishes advice 
on how to enter the business 
world. 

“I get to interview business 

leaders from the most exciting 
companies and flesh out the 

magic of what goes on behind 
the scenes in business,” Sikand 
said. “I like to take listeners 
beyond the headlines — get a 
little deeper, get a little more 
personal.”

Similarly, LSA junior Bret 

Duntley 
created 
a 
social 

media platform, Jillion, that 
allows users to post any type 
of content they want through 
their own individual “pages.” 
His hope is that people will 
be able to engage with others 
about 
complicated 
issues 

in depth. Over the summer, 
Duntley spent 10 hours a day 
writing more than 30,000 
lines of code. 

“I used to do a lot of art in 

high school, but I never really 
saw the connection between 
art 
and 
computer 
science 

until I started my website,” 
Duntley said. “What’s kept 
me going through this is the 
fact that I can be creative 
while designing something I’m 
passionate about.” 

LSA 
sophomore 
Annie 

Malek has a sticker-making 
business. As a creative outlet 
during 
the 
long 
months 

of quarantine, she took to 
drawing and designing. She 
uses the website Redbubble to 
sell stickers and face masks. 

“Honestly, I really love just 

making people happy with 
my 
designs,” 
Malek 
said. 

“Whenever someone receives 
something 
I 
make 
they’re 

always so thankful and it 
makes me super happy to make 
them something that they love. 
It also gives me something 
more creative to do, since I 
am majoring in chemistry and 
most of the things I do during 
the day are STEM-based.”

The students emphasized 

that one of the more difficult 

aspects of starting a new 
project is the fear of it not 
being successful. However, all 
three students trusted that it 
would work out in the end. 

“Starting a small business 

is a great way to get to know 
people who you never would 
have talked to before,” Malek 
said. “I love being able to 
put something I made on my 
laptop or water bottle and then 
creating conversation starters 
out of it.”

The 
students 
said 
their 

projects have also brought 
them closer to their family 
members 
and 
teammates, 

whether 
through 
team 

meetings 
over 
Zoom 
or 

conversing with supporters.

“One of my favorite parts 

about this process was being 
able to have conversations with 
my dad (who’s in business) 
that he and I have never had 
before,” Serhan said. “It was 
really insightful to be able to 
learn about his perspective 
of running a business. The 
amount of support that we 
received 
from 
people 
like 

this created such a positive 
contribution.” 

Malek 
said 
she 
would 

encourage others who are 
interested 
in 
trying 
new 

endeavors to not put too much 
pressure on themselves. Li 
agreed and added that an idea 
can grow into a hobby or even 
a larger passion project.

“When you have an idea, 

you never know what’s going 
to come from it,” Li said. 
“Everyone’s brain is wired 
differently, and that’s what 
makes 
everyone’s 
ideas 

awesome.”

For The Daily

On Oct. 2, Robert Gordon, 

director 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Health and 
Human 
Services, 
received 

news 
that 
the 
Michigan 

Supreme Court struck down 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 

authority 
to 
extend 
or 

declare any executive orders 
pertaining to the COVID-19 
Pandemic. 

Gordon, 
who 
oversees 

many statewide health and 
human 
services 
programs 

such as Medicaid, Children’s 
Protective Services and food 
assistance, 
expressed 
his 

disappointment at the ruling, 
stating that it helped to save 
thousands of lives over the 
course of the past few months 
since the beginning of the 
outbreak. 

“I thought it was a bad 

decision,” Gordon said. “(The 
ruling) undermined rules that 
have helped to save thousands 
of lives.”

Following 
the 
ruling, 

Gordon and the rest of the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Health and Human Services 
released 
an 
order 
with 

mandates that mirrored those 
of Gov. Whitmer’s executive 
orders. 
The 
DHHS 
was 

allowed to set in place their 
own protocols by issuing them 
in accordance with Public 
Health Code Act 368, a law 
that resulted from the 1918 flu 
pandemic that swept through 
the United States.

The public health order 

requires those who attend 
a public gathering of 10 or 
more people to wear a mask 
and limits the number of 
people who can be in a store 
or restaurant at a time. Under 
the order, restaurants, retail 
stores, libraries or museums 
can reopen at 50% capacity 

and gyms can reopen at 25% 
occupancy. The order also 
attempts to strengthen contact 
tracing efforts by requiring 
that all businesses mentioned 
in the order get the contact 
information of anyone who 
enters the establishment. The 
order also allows for bars 
to reopen, a provision that 
was not in any of Whitmer’s 
executive orders.

In Michigan, there have 

been nearly 160,000 cases of 
coronavirus 
reported 
since 

the start of the pandemic 
in March, and over 7,000 
deaths, according to the state 
government.

Gordon 
expressed 
the 

need 
for 
the 
orders 
and 

a 
coordinated 
approach 

between the state’s health 
department and localities to 
ensure that the risk of COVID-
19 in Michigan remains low. 

“We know that shared goals 

help people know what they 
need to do,” Gordon said. “And 
there is a great deal of evidence 
that shared rules have been 
effective in the spread of 
COVID and the absence of 
rules has increased the spread. 
It’s our job to provide things 
for public health.”

In order to enforce these 

mandates, law enforcement is 
authorized to enforce the order 
and investigate any possible 
violations of the mandates. 
Violators may be charged with 
a misdemeanor, which could 
be punishable by six months of 
jail time, or a fine of $200, or a 
fine of $1,000 if it is labeled a 
civil offense.

The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health 
Department 
also 

released a set of its own public 
health mandates in response 
to the Michigan’s Supreme 
Court’s decision. The public 
health provisions stated that 
indoor gatherings are limited 
to 10 guests and outdoor 

events can only hold up to 25 
people. The orders also act 
in accordance with those set 
forth by the DHHS, limiting 
the occupancy of bars and 
restaurants to 50% capacity.

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

Communications and Health 
Promotion Administrator at 
the University of Michigan, 
talked about the need for 
social gathering limits given 
that Ann Arbor is home to 
more than 40,000 students 
who attend the University. 

“There was a lot of concern 

just around college culture,” 
Ringler-Cerniglia said. “That 
there would be a lot of house 
parties and large gatherings 

when folks came back to the 
area. (The order) was more 
about 
generally 
trying 
to 

reinforce smaller gathering 
size 
and 
precautions 
and 

making it a little easier to 
manage.” 

In 
Washtenaw 
County, 

there have been over 4,000 
confirmed cases since the 
start of the pandemic.

The University of Michigan 

also recently triggered two of 
its metrics for reevaluating 
in-person campus activities, 
as 
Washtenaw 
County 
is 

seeing more than 70 new cases 
per 
million 
residents 
and 

exceeding five days straight of 
increased positive cases. 

Public Health junior Sophia 

Heimowitz spoke to The Daily 
about her growing concerns 
that without any public health 
provisions in place, college 
students and other residents in 
Michigan will totally disregard 
any attempt at mitigating the 
spread of COVID-19. 

“People 
already 
are 
not 

wearing masks when it was 
required,” Heimowitz said. “So 
to take any recommendations 
and 
requirements 
away, 
I 

think it drastically impacts 
(the spread of) COVID way 
for the worse, and (the virus) 
would 
spread 
much 
more 

rapidly.” 

Therefore, 
to 
continue 

to mitigate the spread of 
the 
coronavirus, 
Director 

Gordon and other Michigan 
Health 
Department 
leaders 

will continue to enforce the 
provisions they set forth to 
continue to save the lives of 
people across the state of 
Michigan. 

“Our focus is what our role is 

in public health,” Gordon said. 
“Our role is ‘what will help 
as many people as possible?’ 
Our goal is to protect public 
health and protect all of our 
Michiganders.”

Rick’s announces its opening with limited capacity Thursday morning.
Popular local bar Rick’s 
reopens with restrictions

After being shut down since 

March due to the pandemic, Rick’s 
American Cafe announced on social 
media they will reopen their doors 
Thursday with limited capacity.

Complying with guidelines from 

the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, masks will be required 
for entry and guests will have their 
temperatures taken before being 
let inside, the post read. Tables 
will be spaced out to follow social 
distancing protocols. Rick’s is also 
requiring guests to save their place 
in line through the application 
LineLeap. 

“WE’RE BACK TOMORROW!” 

a Wednesday post on Rick’s 
Instagram read. “Due to limited 
capacity and high demand, the 
only way to get in is to reserve your 
spot 
through 
@lineleaptickets 

SpotSaver feature on the LineLeap 
app!”

To book a reservation through 

the app, guests are able to select a 
30-minute time slot in which they 
plan to arrive that night. Upon 
arrival, customers must show the 
doorman their pass on their phone 
to be let into the bar. 

Rick’s recommends four to six 

people for each reservation with a 
maximum of eight people. A limited 
number of places are available for 
each 30-minute time slot. Guests 
with reservations are allowed to 
stay for an unlimited amount of 
time. 

Rick’s 
did 
not 
immediately 

respond to The Michigan Daily’s 
request for comment.

LSA senior Margo Dickstein 

said she felt angry about Rick’s

“It’s been kind of obvious in 

this semester that a lot of people

“But now it’s Ricks — it’s already 
always crowded and full of people. 
I just don’t understand how they’re 
allowed to be open.”

Dickstein turned 21 in April and 

has not yet had the chance to go to 
Rick’s. 

“I would love to be able to go to 

Rick’s in a normal time, that would 
be really fun, it’s an experience 
I haven’t been able to have,” 
Dickstein said. “But I would never 
go there now because of public 
health reasons.”

Student favorite returns to business with limited capacity


I am often amazed at 

how 
little 
people 
know 

about Executive Order 9066 
(deemed Japanese Americans 
as a threat to national secu-
rity and allowed President 
Roosevelt to move them into 
camps), if they have any idea 
of it at all. Sometimes they’re 
even more distraught when I 
say that we have locked peo-
ple up in of the many atroci-
ties that the United States 
has committed. Yet this is a 
history that many Japanese 
Americans will never forget. 
While my family arrived here 
post-Japanese internment, it 
still is a scar that lays heav-
ily on my mind and my com-
munity. This is a scar that is 
never left alone — it is picked 
at, made red and inflamed 
every time the United States 
bans people from our country 
or locks them up for the sake 
of “national security.” While 
some may say national secu-
rity is a necessity, I say that it 
is a way that the government 
has been able to excuse atroc-
ities and misuse the bodies of 
those they deem dangerous 
for capitalist gains. 

In the case of Japanese 

internment, Japanese Ameri-
can men were only allowed 
out of camps if they agreed 
to fight in the United States 
Army 
and 
become 
canon 

fodder for Uncle Sam in 
World War II. Their choice 
was either to fight for the 
country 
that 
criminalized 

them for their racial iden-
tity or remain locked up for 
an unforeseeable amount of 
time. 
Japanese 
Americans 

were even forced to complete 
a “loyalty questionnaire” to 
determine their American-
ness and whether they would 
be allowed to leave the camps 
(or sent to more strict pris-
ons). The term No-No Boys 
was used to identify young 
interned men who answered 
no to the questions “Are 
you willing to serve in the 
armed forces of the United 
States on combat duty wher-
ever ordered?” and “Will you 
swear unqualified allegiance 
to the United States of Amer-

ica and faithfully defend the 
United States from any or all 
attack by foreign or domestic 
forces, and forswear any form 
of allegiance or obedience to 
the Japanese emperor, to any 
other foreign government, 
power 
or 
organization?” 

When I first learned this, 
I couldn’t help but wonder 
what my answer would have 
been. If I would have been 
defeated 
enough 
to 
sign 

myself away to a country that 
despised me, or potentially 
lose any sort of freedom in 
the future. In some ways this 
is the kiss of death promised 
in the American Dream. Will 
you accept all of the ugliness 
of this country and its hatred 
for you, for the chance to sur-
vive? For a shot at the indi-
vidualistic, “pull yourself up 
by the bootstraps” mentality 
that the State seems to wor-
ship?

The legality of people in 

the United States has long 
been contested as well as 
what the State is able to do 
with the bodies of its citi-
zens. Now more than ever, 
the ghosts of past atroci-
ties seem like greater warn-
ing signs to people of today. 
While 
Japanese 
American 

internment may have fallen 
into some of the more for-
gotten shadows of American 
history, its legacy remains. 
This legacy of xenophobia, 
fear of the other and fabri-
cated foreignness of anyone 
who is not white has been 
woven into the fabric of this 
country. It is not new and it 
never will be, as Ocean Vuong 
said “Some people say history 
moves in a spiral, not the line 
we have come to expect. We 
travel through time in a cir-
cular trajectory, our distance 
increasing from an epicen-
ter only to return again, one 
circle removed.” Detention 
camps and the human rights 
abuses that happen there are 
not outliers or brief failures 
in American morality, they 
are a continued pattern of the 
intentional destruction the 
United States deems as other. 
And so often, we are taught to 
forget that such a thing has 
happened before so that the 
same violence can be prac-
ticed again.

The Middle East is the global 

West’s favorite foreign policy 
puzzle. Endless commentators 
and journalists alike aim to 
fit narratives that the Middle 
East is weak, and that imperi-
alist nations such as the Unit-
ed States have a duty to save 
the Arab World from itself. 
Fueling the political agenda, 
numerous 
politicians 
have 

honed in on efforts to “bring 
peace” to the Middle East, 
with the latest attempt being 
President Trump’s treaty. A 
treaty that has been lauded 
by liberals and conservatives 
alike, 
between 
imperialist 

UAE and colonial Israel. This 
American 
infatuation 
with 

Middle Eastern politics is not 
lost on Arabs like myself and 
each take is more nauseat-
ing than the next. Whether 
reflecting on 2011 during the 
Arab uprisings or focusing on 
current politics surrounding 
each nation and its relation to 
known adversaries like Israel, 
I am continuously dismayed 
by each twisted belief stated 
by the media and political 
elite. There is a false assump-
tion that the Middle East can 
not govern or save itself and is 
solely dependent on Western 
interference for its survival-
interventions that have argu-
ably caused the majority of 
the issues in the Middle East. 
It’s the white savior complex 
on steroids, and unfortunately 
this mindset and its detrimen-
tal effects have wreaked havoc 
in the region while affecting 
the mainstream American per-
ception of the Arab World and 

its inhabitants. With oriental-
ist roots and an education sys-
tem geared toward the erasure 
of settler colonialism both 
abroad and in North America, 
Western perception of the 
Middle East has been manipu-
lated to ensure that the Middle 
East never truly has peace.

In almost every impression, 

the Middle East is painted 
with a broad brush. Absolute-
ly stupefying to have to state, 
it’s critical that I clarify that 
though nations in the Middle 
East are meshed together geo-
graphically, this does not mean 
that each country faces the 
same issues. The Gulf region — 
an area encompassing nations 
like UAE, Qatar and Saudi Ara-
bia — has in no way suffered 
similarly to other countries in 
the Arab world, as they, along-
side the West, continue to 
exploit the rest of the Middle 
East for monetary and politi-
cal gain. Nations like Syria, 
Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, 
and Lebanon — though all 
impoverished — face varying 
crises, whether they be civil 
wars, famines, occupation or 
American-backed corrupt gov-
ernments. Another affronting 
assumption is that the Arab 
general public agrees with the 
governments of their coun-
tries, an idea that is blatantly 
false. The Middle East does 
not have a single democracy, 
and the general public does not 
have a fair say in their politics. 
Using Israel as an example yet 
again, it is often claimed that 
citizens of Saudia Arabia, the 
UAE and Bahrain are in agree-
ment with their governments 
who recognize the Zionist 
state. Such claims have been 
proven false as studies sug-

gest the majority of civilians 
are angered by their countries’ 
support of a nation they deem 
colonial. The Middle East, 
like every other region has 
nuance, but due to the failures 
of Western education systems 
and targeted political destruc-
tion, it is painted as having the 
same issues, when in actuality, 
issues strongly differ depend-
ing on the country.

In regard to our educa-

tion system, the way the West 
frames issues in the Middle 
East is alarming. Time and 
time 
again, 
marginalized 

groups have rightfully com-
plained that the American 
education system, including 
higher education, has a domi-
nant 
Eurocentric 
narrative. 

We often hear about issues 
like slavery, colonialism, impe-
rialism and other forms of 
explotiation through the lens 
of Western perspectives. The 
system, rarely, if ever, men-
tions the Middle East or its 
history, and if it does, it only 
discusses its failures. Rarely 
discussed when analyzing the 
roots of a troubled Middle 
East are the flawed borders 
in the Arab world created by a 
drunk Churchill and his allies, 
or Britain’s role in cultivat-
ing Israeli settler colonialism. 
With a purposeful framework, 
our history classes and politi-
cal agendas have presented a 
seemingly frail Middle East; 
one that can only ever appear 
anti-Semitic, 
fraught 
with 

Islamic terrorism, war torn 
and unable to solve its own 
problems.

Courses at the University 

of Michigan are surely not 
immune from this horrific 
framing. As a student studying 

political science, I have heard 
awfully misguided opinions 
on the Middle East — opinions 
that lack a true understanding 
of the region. For instance, I 
have heard horrifying notions 
that the Iraq War was valid, a 
war that decimated a region 
and slaughtered the lives of 
hundreds of thousands. I have 
had to listen to long lectures 
about 9/11 and that the attack 
justifies the Afghanistan war 
— a war that the U.S. is los-
ing and has led to the callous 
murders of civilians and alien-
ation of a region. Mentioned 
in a variety of contexts, 9/11 is 
also spoken of in courses unre-
lated to politics and history as 
classes, like my basic French 
course, continue to emphasize 
narratives that victimize the 
West as the West continues to 
oppress the Middle East. Even 
though 9/11 was a tragic attack, 
multiple tales of terrorism 
were spun that solely depict-
ed harm to white populations 
while conveniently leaving out 
that most victims of “radical 
Islamic” terrorism are Mus-
lims and Middle Easterners 
themselves. I have listened to 
the justification of American 
forces in the Middle East and 
the nullification of Palestine 
and sentiments that Palestine 
is a terrorist state and Israel 
is the only “democracy in the 
Middle 
East,” 
purposefully 

excluding Israeli Occupation 
of Palestinian lands. Every 
single issue that relates to the 
Arab world gets its one-sided 
analysis, often leaving those 
affected daily by these topics 
lost and aching to respond.

What 
makes 
a 
vicious 

cycle even worse is the pro-
hibitions that keep me from 

using my voice or speaking 
from experience, so to defend 
these ignorant narratives in 
the classroom, for if I do, I 
am overwhelmed by scrutiny 
from my peers. If I condemn 
American imperialism in the 
Middle East or emphasize the 
corrupted 
justifications 
for 

the Iraq and Afghanistan War, 
will it seem as if I am vindic-
tive, my anger fueled by uni-
versal feelings of dread within 
the region? When I state that 
I believe Zionism is a threat 
to Arab sovereignty and the 
Palestinian people, will they 
assume I state that solely 
because I am Arab or because 
I have come to this reasoning 
through solid evidence? Every-
one but fellow Arabs and I are 
able to speak without seeming 
as though we are predisposed. 
It is impossible to truly sepa-
rate myself from my identity, 
nor do I want my identity as an 
Arab American Muslim to be 
disjointed from who I am. But 
unfortunately, these classes 
are consumed by people who 
would rather assume I am 
motivated by biases, because 
they refuse to accept this mar-
ginalization as colonial strat-
egy. Frankly, I am partially 
biased. It is impossible not to 
be when I have seen friends 
deported, cried with them 
over deaths overseas and felt 
deep pangs of fear whenever 
an attack occurs in the Middle 
East, fearing for my family 
and my friends’ families safe-
ty. Despite being emotionally 
fueled, these biases are backed 
by substantial data, and I, 
alongside allies, have history 
and human rights as founda-
tions for our beliefs. As I, and 
others like me, are labeled 

“biased” while everyone else 
is allowed a valid opinion, any 
possibility of peace in the Mid-
dle East dims as the Western 
voice is elevated.

All of these factors breed the 

current toxic landscape of the 
Middle East. Intervention by 
political forces have exacer-
bated severe flaws in the Arab 
region and are the origins of 
the destruction that the U.S. 
and the West claim they yearn 
to pacify. The American politi-
cal system supports Israeli 
annexation, makes financial 
gains from Saudi’s war with 
Yemen, and has continued to 
exacerbate wars in the region 
to appease the military indus-
trial complex. It certainly did 
not have to be that way. With 
only Westerners having the 
ability to comment on Middle 
Eastern 
politics, 
American 

intervention in the region and 
a twisted education system 
geared to demean Arab His-
tory and prop up imperialism, 
there is a mainstream belief 
that the West is the only one 
that can save the Middle East. 
In actuality, the notion of a 
white savior complex has been 
ironically bred out of white 
destruction of the region. How 
can the Middle East depend on 
Western touch for the revival 
of a heart the West stabbed 
to decimate? If the West truly 
wanted peace in the Middle 
East, they would leave the 
Arab world alone to fight for 
their own liberation. But they 
don’t, and that’s why the Mid-
dle East will never truly have 
peace with Western interven-
tion — not because Arabs do 
not want it, but because the 
West itself has an active stake 
in depriving it.

‘Peace’ in the Middle East

History is circular;
A reflection on Japanese Internment


On a Saturday night, after 

being encouraged by my SI 110 
professor as well as — ironically 
enough — nearly all of my social 
media feeds, a couple friends and 
I decided to watch The Social 
Dilemma, Netflix’s acclaimed 
documentary centered around 
the meticulously manipulative 
aspects of social media. The 
documentary claims that the 
principal intention of all social 
media is to exploit the vulner-
abilities of human behavior for 
profit through engaging tech-
niques such as constant notifi-
cations, precise algorithms that 
create personalized feeds, and 
exploiting different demograph-
ics of users in order to propagate 
agendas. The Social Dilemma 
incorporates interviews from 
high-up tech executives, shroud-
ed in despairing instrumentals 
and 
horrifying 
infographics. 

Though the notion that social 
media can lead to addictive ten-
dencies — especially in an atten-
tion economy — is no revelation, 
the documentary reveals exactly 
how companies achieve this: 
by capitalizing on our brains’ 
evolutionary demand for inter-
personal connection. Upon fin-
ishing the film, my friends and 
I were, to say the least, terri-
fied. The fact that our data and 
online personas were being auc-
tioned off to advertisers felt like 
betrayal, and that isn’t even the 
worst part: We’re allowing it to 
happen.

Very quickly, we all posed 

the same question: why would 
Netflix, a company that thrives 
off of manipulative techniques, 
highlight all of this information 
and make it readily available to 
its audience? The techniques 
described in the documentary, 
such as perfecting algorithms in 
order to keep audiences engaged 
and stay glued to their screens 
for hours, are precisely what 
makes Netflix such a successful 
platform. To produce and release 
The Social Dilemma almost feels 
like a magician revealing how 
they do their tricks. Why would 
you ever want your audience to 
know?

Almost instantaneously, the 

answer to my question struck 
me, and I realized why Netf-
lix, along with platforms like 
Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, 
YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and 
Snapchat were okay with being 
bashed in front of a global audi-
ence: They wanted to evaluate 
how successful their manipula-
tive efforts really were. Millions 
of people across the globe were 
being presented with only nega-
tive information about our daily 
habits, yet we accept the loss 
of our privacy and the contin-
ued influence of our cognitive 
processes as a price for a little 
more 
convenience 
and 
eas-

ily accessible entertainment. In 
short, they’ve won. They have 
successfully gotten an entire 
worldwide population so addict-

ed and dependent on interper-
sonal connection and validation 
through social networking that 
all we can do is helplessly watch 
and accept the fact that this is 
something we need in our lives. 
The implications of our reliance 
on social media have led to an 
influx of surveillance capital-
ism, a form of our economy that 
mines human experience in the 
form of data in order to produce 
marketable inferences about the 
next thing that we will do, pur-
chase or believe. Now, if you’re 
anything like me, you’re prob-
ably shaking your head right 
now and thinking “I’m not even 
addicted!” After all, as members 
of Gen Z, tech is kinda our thing. 
There’s no way it could be doing 
something to us that we don’t 
understand — right? The harsh 
reality is that computers don’t 
discriminate, and regardless of 
age or experience with technol-
ogy, you’re just another prod-
uct that they’re trying to make 
money off of.

Despite being told by social 

media developers themselves 
that their platforms have got-
ten out of hand and that they 
wouldn’t even let their own kid 
use their creations, nothing in 
my life has changed. Why, after 
learning about how I’ve been 
manipulated, fed content that 
has trapped me in a filter bubble, 
and sold to millions of adver-
tisers as a product was I still 
willingly supporting my own 
downfall? 
This 
documentary 

was the cherry on top of all of the 
other information I had learned 
in SI 110, and the detrimental 
effects of my social media usage 
greatly outweighed any surface 
level benefits. 

The documentary leaves its 

audience with an almost dys-
topian 
message 
of 
urgency: 

continue the conversation, and 
regain control of your life. The 
most dire question posed by 
The Social Dilemma is whether 
or not democracy can survive 
social media’s ability to blur the 
line between reality and fiction. 
Tristan Harris, president of the 
Center for Humane Technol-
ogy and a key speaker in the 
documentary, poses “imagine 
a world where no one believes 
what’s true.” How do we rum-
mage through conspiracy theo-
ries, propaganda and infamous 
“fake news” in order to discern 
facts from lies? More impor-
tantly, is this our responsibility 
as the consumer, or is it on the 
tech industry to actively make 
efforts against the spread of 
disinformation? While I person-
ally don’t believe that everybody 
needs to delete all of their online 
accounts, we can collectively 
make efforts to limit our screen 
time and set aside blocks of 
our day for activities that don’t 
involve our devices. I under-
stand, however, that this sounds 
extremely cliché, and it’s noth-
ing that’s never been suggested 
before. I suppose that I, along 
with tech professionals, still 
don’t have a concrete answer to 
this social dilemma.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

If you can keep calm in the face of 
provocation, Aries, his can be an 
exceptional week for your career. 
Teamwork shows you in a good 
light, so don’t neglect your 

colleagues. It’s not 
always about going it 
alone or being top dog.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

Allow yourself to listen to your 
inner instincts. Your intuition is 
strong, and your mind is able to 
recognize things that your 
conscious may actively choose to 

ignore. In doing so, you 
will be able to choose 
the path that is best for 
you. 

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

In this romantic week, communi-
cation between you and your 
sweetheart is almost telepathic. 
You can make an unbeatable 
team now, Cancer, as your shared 

goals and dreams are 
coming to fruition. If 
you’re single, look out 
for someone who 
shocks you.

TAURUS

Dip your toe into exciting waters 
by being prepared to try 
something new. From exotic travel 
to adrenaline sports or intriguing 
affairs, you’re willing to take a risk 

now if something stirs 
your soul. Beyond your 
comfort zone, Taurus, 
life takes off.

VIRGO

PICES

LIBRA
LEO

An easing of financial pressures 
does a lot of good for your anxiety 
and mental health, Leo. However, 
it’s important now that you take 
control of your own emotions. 

Don’t leave yourself 
vulnerable, mentally, to 
fluctuating external 
circumstances.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Your superpower this week is your 
creativity, Virgo. You have a 
strong feel for lateral thinking and 
innovative ideas, or creations will 
get you noticed. Don’t feel that 

you have to do things the 

way they’ve always 
been done. Dare to be 
different.

Loving support from your family 
means a great deal to you this 
week and you’ll feel blessed by 
those closest to you. If someone 
confides in you, Libra, it’s vital that 

you keep their confidence. 

Don’t turn this into an 
issue of trust.

Your words have a lot of power and 
presence this week, and once the 
Sun arrives in your own sign, 
Scorpio, your magnetism and 
charisma are off the scale. All of 

this means that people are 

taking notice of you – so 

you’d better have 
something meaningful 
to say.

Recognition at work is long 
overdue but welcome, nonethe-
less. This week, Sagittarius, 
stretch your ambitions by looking 
for new challenges. Not 

necessarily a new job, 

but new responsibili-

ties within your 
existing role. You’re 
more than capable.

You have the gift of the gab this 
week, Capricorn, so you’re able to 
put your opinions quite forcefully 
without coming across as 
insensitive or dogmatic. Turn this 

to your advantage if you 

want to get someone to 

agree to a new idea.

Messages from your dreams 
become easier to recall and 
interpret this week. Spend some 
time with a dream journal if you 
can – there is a lot if insight here 

which could change your 

life, Aquarius. Don’t 
dismiss what you can’t 
quite understand.

This is a healing week for a close 
relationship, Pisces, which will 
benefit from as much fun and 
laughter as possible. Socialize as a 
couple if you can, because you’ll 
love seeing each other in a new 

light. Mix and mingle, 
enjoy good company, 
and shine.

love love love but I have to let 
it go.”

If you know anything at all 

about musical theatre, you know 
all about the rise of ‘Hamilton: 
An American Musical’ in 2016. 
The musical, written by Lin-
Manuel Miranda and adapted 
from Ron Chernow’s book ‘Alex-
ander Hamilton,’ debuted off-
broadway in 2015 and since then, 
it has become the most popular 
musical in recent history. The 
show played in New York City, 
Chicago, San Francisco and Los 
Angeles and now a recorded per-
formance with the original cast 
is streaming on Disney+ for mil-
lions of streamers to watch in 
their own homes.

I am not unique when I say 

that I fell in love with this musi-
cal when I first discovered it. 
My friends and I would play 
the soundtrack every day after 
school and my high school’s 
marching band even performed 
its hit song, “Burn,” through-
out the football season. My best 
friends even took me to see the 
show for my birthday in Chica-
go a couple of years ago (I have 
no idea how they swung that 
because we’re broke college stu-
dents) and I absolutely loved it.

At first glance, I’m sure many 

people would not expect a musi-
cal about Alexander Hamilton 
and other Founding Fathers to 
be a wildly popular sensation. 
However, the fusion of hip-hop 
and history is what makes it so 
entertaining and was the rea-
son I loved it so much. But due 

to my naivety and ignorance of 
accurate American history, I saw 
‘Hamilton’ as a fun show with 
cool songs instead of a confus-
ing and distasteful retelling of 
history. The show has received 
criticism since its debut at The 
Public Theater in New York, the 
majority of which stems from 
Miranda’s inaccurate retelling 
and framing of history.

Many critics of color think it 

is necessary to remember that 
‘Hamilton’ is nowhere near an 
accurate representation of the 
Founding Fathers. They were 
not underdog heroes or abo-
litionists, but capitalists who 
stole Native American land and 
enslaved and exploited Black 
and Brown people. They were 
white 
supremacists. 
Among 

many atrocities, Thomas Jef-
ferson sexually assaulted Sally 
Hemmings, an enslaved Black 
woman who worked in his home, 
and then enslaved the children. 
George 
Washington’s 
teeth, 

that many of us were told were 
made of wood, were teeth from 
enslaved people. And of course, 
Alexander Hamilton purchased 
enslaved people to work for his 
family. How can we be so far 
removed from these horrors that 
we can sing and dance along 
to songs about these men and 
ignore the terrors they inflicted 
on Black people?

After knowing this informa-

tion, other points of criticism 
become increasingly valid. For 
example, some viewers question 
the choice of hiring nearly all 
people of color to play the role 
of white historical figures. In 
regards to this, Miranda stated 
he wanted the story to be “told 
by America now.” But I wonder 
how this can be successfully 
done when the whiteness of the 
Founding Fathers and their fam-
ilies is crucial to why they were 
able to rise into power. If the 
story of the Founding Fathers 
were to be told based on the way 
America looks now, they should 
still be portrayed as rich, white 
men who exploit and oppress 
low-income, Black people. By 
erasing that their race had an 
active role in the power they had 
to oppress others, we downplay 
the racism that they wrote into 
our country’s foundation.

Another major critique focus-

es on the musical’s use of hip hop 
to portray white supremacists as 
relatable and comedic. Miranda 
believes “hip-hop’s the language 
of revolution and it’s our great-
est American art form,” which 
I would have to agree with, but 
whose revolution? Black people 
were not included in the Dec-
laration of Independence when 
slave-owner Thomas Jefferson 
wrote, “We hold these truths to 
be self-evident, that all men are 
created equal.” So why appro-
priate Black culture to uplift 
white supremacists? If we want 
to make a statement about revo-
lution and fighting for freedom 
in the United States, telling the 
story of the white men in power 
seems to be the worst way to do 
so.

I am puzzled and conflicted 

about how I feel about ‘Ham-
ilton’ today. I don’t believe 
Lin-Manuel Miranda or any 
of the crew and cast purpose-
fully wanted to erase history or 
offend viewers, and for the most 
part, many people still love the 
musical. We cannot deny that 
‘Hamilton’ has opened the doors 
for many performers of color to 
become household names on 
Broadway. But as a Black Ameri-
can woman, it makes me wonder 
how our ancestors would have 
felt about this story. They were 
the ones who built this country 
from the ground up, not Hamil-
ton, Washington, or Jefferson. 
And yet, we collectively gloss 
over their stories and hard work.

The criticisms and conver-

sations that people around the 
world have been having about 
‘Hamilton’ dig into important 
questions about how history 
should be told and who should 
be centered in those retellings. 
Could you imagine if, in 200 
years, there were a musical called 
Trump? We would see actors of 
color portraying Donald Trump, 
Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo 
instead of hearing the stories 
of Black and Brown people who 
were targeted and suffering at 
the hands of this administration. 
That would be outrageous, and 
yet, how different would that 
be from ‘Hamilton?’ We must 
pay attention to the way we are 
retelling the stories of the past as 
not to have our current reality be 
inaccurately retold in the future.

Opinion

Students being taken advantage of 
by those with wealth and power 
on college campuses isn’t new; 
graduate students had to go on 
strike this fall in order for the 
University of Michigan to meet 
their basic requests and needs. 
It’s now clear that reopening as 
the University did was not safe, 
and landlords benefitted. This 
situation is indicative of a much 
broader problem of businesses 
and institutions in our community 
taking its backbone — college 
students — for granted, leaving 
students with their hands tied. 

One reason why Ann Arbor 

landlords 
are 
able 
to 
take 

advantage of students in such a 
way is the scarcity of good housing 
options, 
which 
incentivizes 

students to lock in houses as 
early in the season as possible. 
Landlords 
likely 
do 
this 
to 

combat one of the few safeguards 
students have in the off-campus 
housing market, which is a city 
ordinance requiring landlords to 
wait a minimum of 70 days from 
the beginning of a lease-term to 
officially show or lease a property 
to prospective new tenants. This 
early leasing period requires many 
students to pay housing deposits 
almost a full year in advance. This 
may be particularly difficult for 
low-income students who cannot 
afford to let a leasing company 
hold onto a large deposit for almost 
two years.

The difficulty of paying a 

housing deposit a year early 
has been exacerbated by the 
pandemic and resulting economic 
downturn, where many families 
lost 
their 
primary 
source 

income and need the increased 
flexibility of holding onto this 
money for several more weeks 
or months. While the pandemic 
would seem like a great time for 
landlords who cater primarily to 
students to be accommodating 
and understanding, many have 
instead decided to capitalize on 
the insecure nature of student 
housing. 
The 
pandemic 
has 

enabled landlords to act with 
greed, and to act quickly, pushing 
students into a corner where they 
must choose between housing 
insecurity 
for 
the 
following 

school year or risk putting down 
a security deposit, sometimes over 
$1000, on a property in which they 
may never live. These landlords 
are, in essence, preying on an 
inescapable vulnerability shared 
by and fairly unique to nearly all 
college students. 

Rising rent prices in Ann 

Arbor further exacerbate the 
stress of the financial burdens 
that an early lease cycle creates.
The city consistently ranks as 
one of the most expensive college 
towns to live in. Rent prices have 
been rising at a whopping 15.9% 
year-over-year, second only to 
Gainesville, Fla., the home of the 
University of Florida. There are 
several factors that have led to 
this high rent inflation in Ann 
Arbor. With off-campus student 
property occupancy at 98%, Ann 
Arbor is a landlord’s market that 

leaves little power to tenants. 
Landlords are therefore able to get 
away with higher rents. Further, 
the fact that the University of 
Michigan has a relatively wealthy 
student body doesn’t help with the 
rising rent prices. According to 
a study by The New York Times, 
the median income of the U-M 
student’s family is $154,000, with 
about 9.3% students belonging to 
the Top 1% families in the U.S. by 
household income. Only 3.6% of 
students come from the bottom 
20% in terms of household income. 
As long as students are able to pay 
the increasing rents, the trend of 
rents increasing will continue. 

Therefore, 
The 
Michigan 

Daily 
Editorial 
Board 
urges 

the Ann Arbor City Council 
to extend the Early Leasing 
Ordinance. 
Moving 
back 
the 

leasing deadline is necessary to 
allow students to fully consider 
their housing needs and options 
for the next year. For example, in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., which is home 
to the University of Pittsburgh, 
Carnegie Mellon University and 
Chatham University, the typical 
lease renewal cycle for off-campus 
student housing doesn’t start 
until spring. That gives students 
ample time to decide if they like 
their 
current 
apartment 
and 

roommates, both of which are 
major factors in considering a lease 
renewal. It also allows students to 
have increased financial flexibility, 
since they don’t have to pay a 
housing deposit a year in advance. 

However, it’s important to note 

that 
extending 
the 
ordinance 

will not solve all of the problems 
with early leasing. Many Ann 
Arbor real estate companies have 
found ways to creatively interpret 
this 
ordinance. 
These 
leasing 

companies 
allow 
students 
to 

reserve, with a deposit, properties 
several weeks before the deadline. 
Students will then be provided with 
the official paperwork and tour on 
the 70th day of the current lease. If 
a student fails to sign the lease, they 
will lose their reservation deposit. 
This in effect allows real estate 
companies to lease their units 
before they are legally allowed, 
with no official leasing paperwork 
completed 
until 
the 
deadline 

passes. So, while regulations help to 
an extent, the onus is on students to 
unanimously organize themselves 
to sign leases only in the spring 
semester in order to bring a lasting 
change in moving the leasing cycle 
to later in the school year.

Therefore, the Editorial Board 

also urges students themselves 
to fight against this early leasing 
period that landlords enforce on 
campus. While the situation may 
appear hopeless, students do have 
the power to inform themselves 
of the risks of buying into this 
transparent money-grab by our 
community’s landlords. We can use 
our voices to direct fellow students 
to resources that inform them of the 
nature of a student tenant-landlord 
agreement. We can use our voices 
to direct students to landlords 
who treat tenants with dignity and 
respect. And we can use our voices 

to make very public the leasing 
companies in our community 
whose efforts are transparently 
profit-based. Unfortunately, our 
primary source of power in this 
instance is merely to expose 
large Ann Arbor landlords like 
Landmark and Campus Realty, 
who have long-standing, well-
known reputations on campus of 
treating their tenants poorly — at 
least according to online reviews.

Because 
getting 
the 
entire 

student body together will become 
a challenge as long as there is a 
dearth of good housing options, 
an effective way to tackle this 
challenge is for the University to 
step in and offer more low-cost 
on-campus housing at convenient 
locations across campus. Since 
applications 
for 
on-campus 

housing start later in the spring, 
this reduces the pressure on 
students to quickly lock in off-
campus options this early in the 
year. And regarding rising rent 
prices, the onus is once again on the 
City Council to enforce rent control. 
Alternatively, the University should 
step in to offer more low-cost, 
on-campus housing. This will help 
reduce rents and make the housing 
process more equitable for students 
from all sections and financial 
backgrounds. There is urgency in 
taking such measures, particularly 
in the wake of the pandemic which 
has disproportionately impacted 
students 
from 
lower-income 

financial backgrounds.

At least on the local level, 

politicians have attempted to make 
housing more affordable around 
Ann Arbor through the proposal 
of a new tax levy, revenues from 
which would be dedicated to the 
construction of new affordable 
housing units throughout the 
city. The proposal, commonly 
referred to as Proposal-C, is on the 
November election ballots. 

That’s a huge step for the City 

of Ann Arbor, but as of yet there 
are little details as to where these 
new units may be constructed. 
Students have a voice in this. Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
(D) has been vocal in his desire to 
maintain flexibility with regards 
to potential sites for new affordable 
housing 
construction. 
Students 

who agree should feel empowered 
to contact the mayor’s office and 
communicate their beliefs. Student 
agency has been lacking on campus 
for much of this year, especially 
with regard to the University’s 
substandard 
protocols 
for 

managing COVID-19. Affordable 
housing can make a tangible 
difference to thousands of students 
at the University, just as improving 
COVID-19 safety measures made a 
tangible difference to the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization. Students 
with a vested interest in obtaining a 
more affordable living situation on 
campus should make their voices 
heard, just as the GEO did. This 
year has shown us nothing if not 
that progress has to be driven from 
the grassroots.

Combatting exploitative off-campus 

housing in Ann Arbor

I

t is now October in Ann Arbor and along with midterms comes another 
stressor for students: signing off-campus leasing agreements for the 2021-
2022 school year. As with every year, landlords across the campus have 

started sending notices for renewals with a short time-frame for decisions. While 
the ongoing pandemic has created uncertainty around an in-residence 2020-2021 
school year for students, this has not deterred landlords from pushing ahead with 
the lease renewals. This action brings into question not just the long-standing 
problem of early lease-renewal cycles and rising rent prices in Ann Arbor but also 
the ethics of landlords who do not put students’ best interests at the forefront.

C

ollege 
students 
have 

done 
everything 
they 

can 
to 
acclimate 
to 

the 
new 
pandemic 
lifestyle. 

Months of quarantine followed 
by continuous social-distancing 
and adherence to public health 
guidelines brought us to a point 
today where grabbing a mask 
before heading out the door 
has become a natural instinct. 
Though maintaining six feet 
of 
space 
between 
ourselves 

and those we encounter is not 
exactly how we planned to live 
our lives as students at a Big 
Ten university, we’re making 
it work. After all, University of 
Michigan students, for the most 
part, understand the severity of 
the pandemic and do their part in 
keeping our community safe.

What I have not been able to 

acclimate to is remote learning, 
and I believe I speak on behalf 
of the rest of the student body 
when I say that it’s extremely 
challenging to do so. Quite 
frankly, 
our 
current 
virtual 

learning environment is making it 
hard to do so. 

Back in August, as the fall 

2020 semester was approaching, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s 
optimism 
about 

in-person 
instruction 
and 

eagerness to get back on to 
campus made many students 
believe in the possibility of 
a 
positive 
virtual 
learning 

experience. Despite returning 

students’ 
apprehension 
to 

resume virtual learning after 
a dismal, lonely ending to our 
winter 2020 semester, it seemed 
like logging back on to Zoom and 
Canvas this time around would be 
different. After all, the University 
administration and instructors 
alike had four long months to 
brainstorm and execute new ways 
to create an effective and valuable 
virtual learning environment. 

Other than a few courses being 

offered in a hybrid format, very 
little has been modified since 
the commencement of remote 

learning in mid-March. It seems 

as 
though 
many 
instructors 

have done nothing to alter their 
curricula to better accommodate 
these circumstances, thinking 
that students would fare well 
learning material at a similar 
structure and pace as semesters 
past. We’re not well. This is not 
the “Michigan Difference” we 
signed up for. 

In no way am I denying the 

necessity of remote learning; it is 
the safest option for continuing 
our education amid the adversity 
we 
are 
facing. 
That 
said, 

University instructors need to 
recognize that they are no longer 
in the classroom. They need 
to recognize that the majority 
of students no longer enjoy a 
refreshing walk to class in the 
morning, the ability to greet 
and catch up with their friends 
in the Diag or collaborate on 
assignments with classmates in 
the library. 

Our minds are continuously 

working while our bodies stay 
put; we spend the majority of 
our day in a cramped space, 
staring at a screen with little 
pause or break. This change of 
pace correlates to a decline in 
mental health across the student 
body — instructors and the 
administration need to adjust 
their current methods of virtual 
teaching to better accommodate 
our needs.

Let’s further examine student 

mental health and why the 
current means of virtual learning 
is digging us into a deeper hole. 
In early August, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
released research in light of the 
pandemic which reported that a 
disproportionately high number 
— roughly 25% — of American 
citizens between the ages of 18 
and 24 “seriously contemplated 
suicide in June.” 

To reiterate, one in four young 

adults between 18 and 24 years 
old reported having grievous 
thoughts of ending their lives. 
This research was conducted in 
June, a time when the weather 
was finally warm again and 
most students were relieved 
from their studies. If a quarter 
of young people in that age range 
were 
seriously 
contemplating 

suicide then, I cannot begin to 

imagine what that statistic is 
now. October brings colder 
weather and shorter days, and 
though we used to look forward 
to this month to celebrate fall, 
game days and Halloween, our 
celebrations largely have been 
put on pause. 

The 
remainder 
of 
this 

semester is going to be dark — 
literally and figuratively. Student 
mental health is only going to get 
worse as school work picks up. 
Instructors must acknowledge 
this moving forward and reflect 
it in their teaching. 

On 
behalf 
of 
students, 

please attempt to make virtual 
class both more manageable 
and enjoyable. Enable rolling 
deadlines to account for the 
possibility of adverse situations. 
Make lectures more interactive 
and entertaining. Make yourself 
a resource for students to reach 
out to with concerns regarding 
mental health or any troubles 
they are facing. It is not enough 
to include a statement on COVID-
19 in course syllabi and never 
again address the topic for the 
remainder of the semester. 

This is not to say that 

virtual learning is necessarily 
easy 
for 
instructors, 
but 

you are the ones in control. 
University 
administrators, 

too, need to do their part, as 
they are the ones to oversee 
and facilitate our education. It 
is their responsibility to urge 
instructors to assess the needs 
of their students and adjust 
their curricula accordingly. 

Some 
students 
might 
be 

managing these changes well, 
but many feel lost, unable to 
break away from the mental 
fog that virtual learning is 
pressing upon us. We are not 
doing well now and it will 
only get worse, and we must 
reflect this in our approach to 
virtual learning. There was an 
expectation among instructors 
and faculty at the University 
that taking past curricula and 
implementing them virtually 
without any changes would 
work seamlessly. 

It does not. We are not coping. 

Let’s work together to make 
this virtual format as bearable 
and effective as possible before 
it’s too late.

H

ow you prepare for a 
psychedelic 
trip 
can 

make or break your 

experience, not to mention ensure 
that your community stays safe. 
As community members of Ann 
Arbor, Washtenaw County and 
the wider world, it’s important to 
be knowledgeable about the risks 
associated with psychedelic use 
and how to minimize them. 

For 
students 
and 
faculty 

members at the University of 
Michigan, the first thing to 
know is that despite the recent 
measure taken to decriminalize 
entheogenic plants and fungi 
in our area, federal law still 
criminalizes psychedelics. Since 
the University still favors federal 
law and university policy over 
local law when it comes to alcohol 
and drug use, decriminalization 
may not necessarily extend to U-M 
property. Unless the University 
and the federal government say 
it’s OK in the future, it’s still best 
to avoid using psychedelics on 
campus. 

If you are planning on off-

campus use, know what you’re 
putting in your body — this 
is 
especially 
important 
with 

psychedelics 
since 
they’re 

unregulated. While it may seem 
like a hassle, using a testing kit 
or doing some extra research 
on the compound you’re taking 
may save your life by helping you 
avoid adulterated and dangerous 
substances. 

Whether you are seeking out 

a traditional healing journey or 
planning on tripping with a guide, 
approach it cautiously. These 
medicines can be a good thing — 
some Indigenous communities use 
entheogenic plants like ayahuasca 
to help remain spiritually resilient 
and in touch with the natural 
world. But in some cases, it’s 
possible to be taken advantage of if 
the drugs being purchased are not 
legitimate or masked as something 
else. Psychedelics put you in a 
different mindset, for better or 
worse. If it’s worse, the openness 
you experience could leave you in 
a vulnerable position. Despite the 
immense healing that legitimate 
traditional plant medicine can 
bring, 
there 
have 
also 
been 

instances which lead to people 
being sexually abused or dying as a 
result of their participation. 

You have to be careful about 

who you get substances from and 
who you take them with. If you 
choose to use psychedelics with 
a new organization or individual, 
trust your intuition. If something 
feels off, it probably is. Check 
multiple sources for reviews 
of psychedelic effects, do your 
research and don’t trip alone. 

While 
psychedelics, 
when 

taken in the right context, can 
be generally safe and potentially 
beneficial for most people, they 
aren’t 
for 
everyone. 
Bipolar 

disorder and other underlying 
mental and physical conditions 
may cause some people to have 
negative 
reactions. 
Before 

embarking on a trip, research 
effects 
of 
psychedelics 
on 

conditions you may have. In 
addition to talking to trusted 
family, 
friends 
and 
medical 

professionals, you may also want 
to check out local psychedelic 
support 
groups 
and 
other 

resources.

If 
you 
do 
decide 
that 

psychedelics are safe for you, 
the old idea of “set and setting” 
still matters. Set refers to your 
mindset; setting refers to your 
environment. In other words, it’s 
a bad idea to have a psychedelic 
experience in the Arb, the Diag 
or anywhere else by yourself. 
To get the most out of your trip, 
it’s important to be in a good 
mindset and in a place where you 
feel comfortable and with people 
whom you trust. For a more 
meaningful 
experience 
with 

psychedelics, setting an intention 
beforehand and creating space 
afterward for reflection can 
help you integrate what you’ve 
learned into your life. 

While each of these points 

are a start for what individuals 
can do to prepare for a safe 
trip, a community-based model 
could perhaps reduce the most 
harm. Going forward, it may 
be in the interest of retailers 
in the Ann Arbor community 
to consider providing testing 
kits and informational material 
to 
increase 
accessibility 
to 

education and reduce harm. If 
our community were to take 
these measures, like the Zendo 
Project does at music festivals, 
we could further ensure safety 
and responsibility.

Furthermore, in the interest 

of expanding our consciousness 
beyond our own health and safety, 
it’s also important to consider 
community and environmental 
well-being. Certain psychedelic 
plants and animals are becoming 
endangered. As we’ve seen in 
recent years with the Sonoran 
Desert 
Toad, 
Peyote 
and 

Ayahuasca, the demands of non-
native 
American 
psychedelic 

tourists 
are 
overwhelming 

supply, 
leading 
to 
resource 

depletion and a neglection of 
Native American communities.

In the case of the Sonoran 

Desert 
Toad, 
its 
species 
is 

becoming endangered by non-
Native 
American 
psychedelic 

tourists due to 5-MeO-DMT, a 
psychedelic/spiritual 
molecule 

found in the toad’s venom. Since 
the toad’s absence is considered 
a precursor for drought by 
communities 
like 
the 
Yaqui 

tribe of the Southwest U.S. and 
Mexico, endangerment of its 
species represents a risk to the 
ecosystem in which it inhabits 
and a loss to the Native American 
communities who rely on it. 

Peyote, a psychedelic cactus 

containing mescaline, has long 
been endangered in a similar way. 
On March 12, 2020, The National 
Council of Native American 
Churches (NCNAC) and the 
Indigenous Peyote Conservation 
Initiative (IPCI) made a request 
for 
Peyote 
to 
be 
excluded 

from 
Decriminalize 
Nature’s 

campaign due to its endangered 
status and significance to Native 
American communities. If you 
are a non-Native person, please 
reconsider using Peyote and 
other endangered species.

Spontaneity 
and 
the 

opportunity 
to 
explore 
the 

unknown are part of the draw 
of 
psychedelics. 
But 
taking 

precautions, paying attention to 
set and setting and respecting 
Native American communities 
are 
fundamental 
parts 
of 

ensuring personal, communal 
and environmental well-being in 
years to come. If you decide to 
trip, have a good one — but please 
make sure you do so safely and 
thoughtfully.

andlocked 
Bolivia, 

a 
country 
nestled 

between 
regional 

hotspots 
Argentina, 
Chile 

and Peru, has skyrocketed 
to the forefront of the global 
geopolitical struggle. Bolivia’s 
2019 election was fraught with 
allegations of fraud leveled 
against now-former President 
Evo Morales. Morales now 
faces accusations of crimes 
against 
humanity 
due 
to 

allegations that he organized 
food and fuel blockades in 
major 
cities 
engaging 
in 

protests calling for his ousting 
during the election crisis. The 
Bolivian interim government, 
headed by Jeanine Áñez, the 
right-wing 
former 
second 

vice president of the Bolivian 
Senate 
who 
ascended 
to 

power 
constitutionally 

through 
Bolivia’s 
line 
of 

presidential succession, has 
faced considerable backlash 
domestically 
and 
abroad 

following accusations that she 
is an acting coup president by 
leading figures of the Bolivian 
far-left due to the nature of 
Morales’s resignation. 

Bolivians will choose a new 

president on Oct. 18, ending 
the reign of Áñez. However, 
as political tensions continue 
to boil over, deadly forest fires 
have swept across the nation, 
with 62 active fires as of Oct. 
7, according to the Autoridad 
de Bosques y Tierras, and 
more than 2.3 million hectares 
of land burned since January. 
The lungs of the world are 
burning in Bolivia, and no 

one is paying attention: 

In 2019, Bolivia’s forest fires 
contributed so astronomically 
to carbon dioxide emissions 
that 
the 
tiny 
developing 

nation of 11 million rivaled 
the tons per capita emitted 
from the United States, which 
is roughly 14.5 megatons per 
million people.

The 
expansion 
and 
soft 

legalization 
of 
slash-and-

burn agriculture, the primary 
source 
of 
Bolivia’s 
raging 

forest fires, occurred under 
Morales’s rule as he cozied 
up with Bolivia’s wealthy and 
powerful agribusiness elites. In 
2013, the Morales government 
implemented a legal pardon 
for unlawful slash-and-burn 
land 
clearances 
between 

1996-2011. 
Additionally, 
in 

2019, the Morales government 
established laughable fines of 
less than $3 per illegally slash-
and-burned hectare. Morales’s 
unscrupulous abandonment of 
protecting Bolivia’s wildlife 
was 
only 
exacerbated 
by 

a beef trade deal initiated 
with China which required 
the 
extensification 
of 

Bolivian 
beef 
production. 

Consequently, in July 2019, 
Morales enacted a supreme 
expansion of the amount of 
legal 
slash-and-burn 
land 

clearance. 
This 
encouraged 

the use of fire despite serious 
ecological 
concerns 
for 

Bolivia’s forests, resulting in 
disastrous, 
uncontrollable 

fires being ignited in August as 
a result of the deregulated and 
unprosecuted slash-and-burn. 

Hundreds 
of 
thousands 

of 
protesters 
gathered 
in 

October 2019 to protest the 
Morales’s 
government’s 

gross negligence in fighting 
the rapidly expanding fires, 
which persisted until they 
were finally extinguished by 
heavy rainfall. I talked with a 
biologist and conservationist 
on the ground in Bolivia, 
who spoke with me on the 
condition 
of 
anonymity 

because of the volatile political 
situation in the country. On 
Morales’s 
handling 
of 
the 

forest fires, he said, “When 
Evo appeared in front of the 
UN to applaud himself for his 
efforts at combating climate 

change I was horrified. I had 
worked with the very volunteer 
firefighters 
who 
had 
died 

fighting the flames his policies 
had encouraged to be lit.”

With Áñez’s ascension amid 

Bolivia’s 
ecological 
crisis, 

hopes were high that the new 
administration 
would 
tackle 

the 
issues 
that 
Morales’s 

regime had neglected for years. 
Unfortunately, 
Áñez 
initially 

ignored 
petitions 
to 
repeal 

the supreme decree enacted 
by 
Morales 
expanding 
the 

prevalence of slash-and-burn, 
instead, bizarrely focused on the 
expansion of GMOs throughout 
the country. When Áñez finally 
repealed 
the 
decree, 
likely 

to raise her abysmal polling 
numbers, she discreetly replaced 
it with a nearly identical edict 
designed to appease agribusiness 
lobbyists. 

On 
Áñez’s 
actions, 
the 

conservationist I spoke to said, 
“essentially 
Jeanine’s 
policies 

have been a major disappointment 
and have in practice, despite 
the 
rhetoric, 
largely 
been 

a 
continuation 
of 
those 
of 

Morales. The first signs of an 
end to impunity for arsonists are 
encouraging, but there’s a long way 
to go. While there are glimmers of 
hope, the fate of Bolivia’s forests 
will depend on the soon-to-be-
elected government.” 

As the fires in Bolivia rage 

on and continue to pollute and 
destroy one of the world’s most 
unique ecological landscapes, 
the world waits in anticipation to 
see if Bolivia will survive another 
election. Amid the anticipated 
political turmoil, environmental 
policies will undeniably be placed 
on the back-burner, but will still 
remain a pivotal policy point that 
will not only affect the future 
of Bolivia but the future of the 
world.

W

hen I was in the thick of 
my eating disorder, not 
many people in my life 

seemed to be concerned. Maybe they 
were, but it wasn’t shared with me, 
perhaps because they didn’t want 
to assume anything or offend me. If 
that’s the case, I know they meant 
well. But, beyond a lack of concern, 
what was more harmful was the 
praise and glorification I received 
for my eating disorder behaviors. 
And the reason they felt they should 
applaud my disordered behaviors 
is that we are engulfed in a society 
that not only normalizes disordered 
eating, and a toxic relationship with 
exercise, but deems it “healthy.”

I was seen as “healthy” when 

I was restricting foods I deemed 
“bad” or “unhealthy” — a list 
which, when you’re in the midst 
of an eating disorder, only grows 
longer and longer — but the fact of 
the matter is, I was not. And when 
I was doing the most exercise and 
compulsive movements, I was very 
unhealthy. How could that be? The 
more exercise you do and the less 
“unhealthy” foods you eat — or the 
less you eat entirely — the healthier 
you become, right? 

Wrong. 
And not because the combination 

of exercise and eating nutritious 
foods are bad for you. I don’t think 
anyone has ever disputed that and 
I’m surely not. The problem lies in 
the assumption that this is a direct 
causal relationship; it is considered 
a given that if you do these things — 
exercise more, and eat less — you will 
become healthier. There are many 
cases where this has not been the 
outcome, and these are commonly 
the cases of those who transitioned 
into full-fledged eating disorders 
after embarking on a diet or the 
general path of restricting food. 

Yet, our society pushes exercise 

and restricted, or even “clean” 
eating, on us under the guise that 
they’re all-curing and will improve 
our health. They neglect to mention 
that even these habits can be taken 
to the extreme, and when they are 
it’s not guaranteed you become 
ultra-healthy. 
In 
many 
cases, 

extreme “healthy” or “clean” eating 
in particular yields health outcomes 
that are worrisome. 

Orthorexia has been gaining 

recognition in recent years as an 
eating disorder characterized by an 
unhealthy obsession with “healthy” 
eating. It’s not currently in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 

of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition as 
its own stand-alone eating disorder, 
but it does fall under the broad 
category of Avoidant/Restrictive 
Food Intake Disorder: It entails 
avoiding (e.g. restricting) certain 
foods, and as a result, energy needs 
often aren’t met. 

Moreover, a lot of the signs and 

symptoms of the disorder may 
strike you as things people simply 
tend to do these days in the name of 
health. These include compulsively 
checking food labels, cutting out 
entire food groups (e.g. carbs, 
sugars, animal products), and not 
being able to eat anything outside of 
your narrow group of foods you’ve 
deemed “healthy” and/or “clean.” 
When people take these strides and 
engage these behaviors, they receive 
praise from those around them. 
Affirmations of how “healthy” they 
are and how much “willpower” they 
have poured in because diet culture, 
and more specifically the wellness 
diet, has conditioned them to believe 
that we need to purposefully abstain 
from certain foods as best as we 
can to be healthy. Orthorexia has 
become a socially acceptable eating 
disorder. 

Besides those rooted in the anti-

diet culture movement and eating 
disorder 
recovery 
community, 

most everyday people would not be 
alarmed by an individual only eating 
the vegetables at a social gathering 
or, my own past go-to, bringing their 
own food to events. Many turn to 
the latter because the thought of 
even eating an “unhealthy” food 
outside of the ones you’ve deemed 
safe, and often also outside of your 
own preparation, is just not possible. 
They likely applaud your decision to 
abstain from the “bad” food at the 
gathering, and worse, they might 
even say, “I wish I could eat like you 
do.” Everyone with an orthorexic 
past cringes at this comment. 
With these words, you’re not only 
validating the eating disorder as 
something ideal, but you cast aside 
any inclination they may have to 
move toward recovery. This, of 
course, is assuming that they’ve 
begun to realize they have an eating 
disorder. 

The acceptance and praise of 

orthorexic behaviors is one head of 
the beast that is society’s acceptance 
and 
fostering 
of 
restrictive, 

disordered behaviors around food. 
The other is the endless trend on 
social media promoting dangerously 
low-calorie eating (cough, cough, 

TikTok) that’s unsustainable and 
only worsens one’s physical and 
mental health, yet for some reason, 
people are still under the impression 
that these diet trends are for 
“health.” These posts are blatantly 
promoting eating disorder behaviors 
to susceptible populations, like 
middle- and high-schoolers, with 
seemingly no consequences. It’s 
a slap in the face to anyone who 
has ever struggled with an eating 
disorder.

Still, some may argue orthorexia 

isn’t a real eating disorder and is just 
one’s way of complaining and being 
frustrated by the fact that they have 
to eat healthy. They’ll say it’s just 
the price you pay for taking care of 
your body. This dismissive take on 
the subject is incredibly ignorant 
and will likely make the individual 
suffering feel like their struggles are 
invalid and that there is no hope to 
live a better life. Even if you believe 
the effect orthorexia has on one’s 
mental health is simply taxing and 
nothing more than that, the physical 
consequences on one’s health are 
serious. 

Orthorexia can lead to various 

negative 
health 
consequences, 

such 
as 
osteoporosis, 
kidney 

failure, infertility and nutritional 
deficiencies. Hence, it is vital that our 
society collectively begins to view the 
disorder as what it truly is — a serious 
eating disorder that deteriorates one’s 
health as it progresses, not as an ideal 
to strive for in the name of health. 

However, 
because 
orthorexic 

individuals are able to hide their 
disorder behind the intention of just 
wanting to eat healthy, the disordered 
component of their relationship with 
food often goes unnoticed. What’s 
more, because they mask their 
behaviors with a label of “health,” 
it is further encouraged and many 
don’t realize they have a problem 
until much later when health 
consequences 
ensue 
and 
their 

anxiety and fear around “bad” foods 
becomes unbearable. 

There is absolutely a better life 

outside of orthorexia, and a much 
healthier one at that. “Healthy 
eating,” which I put in quotes 
because its definition varies from 
person to person, like anything 
else, can be taken to the extreme. 
In short, that’s what orthorexia is. 
And taking it to this extreme doesn’t 
make one extremely healthy.

“

Have you registered to vote?” 
is an impossible question 
to escape. I’ve found that I 

can’t walk through the Diag, scroll 
through Instagram or even order 
a pizza without encountering 
some iteration of this question. 
Dominating nearly every space, 
it certainly is a pertinent question 
given our current environment. 
Assuming the answer to this 
question is yes, as we transition 
into this election and prepare for 
electoral outcomes, we need to 
ask ourselves a different question: 
What is our role in making this 
nation a functioning and healthy 
democracy? 

A healthy democracy requires 

far more than just electoral 
participation, 
including 
the 

ongoing intellectual and physical 
engagement 
of 
an 
informed 

citizenry. Think of it this way 
— as students, we need to do 
more than just register for the 
semester and pick our preferred 
classes; participation like staying 
informed, having discussions and 
completing other course tasks 
are essential to succeed both in a 
course and in democratic society. 
While voting is essential, using 
our voices through other means of 
engagement can further progress 
our country toward justice and 
equality — the highest ideals of 
democracy.

Simply put, voting is a civic 

duty: something we should see as 
a first step or baseline of political 
participation if we have the 
privilege to vote. In particular, as 
a white, cisgender man, I believe 
it is my duty to vote, as voting 
is one of many tools to amplify 
and represent the voices of those 
who are otherwise silenced in 
government and the electoral 
process 
by 
gerrymandering, 

iterations 
of 
poll 
taxes 
for 

the 
formerly 
incarcerated, 

racially targeted polling station 
closures, other forms of voter 
suppression and more. I can use 
my privilege to support and vote 
for candidates who commit to 
expanding the franchise. I can 
have conversations with those 
who can’t vote and consider 
their perspective on ballot issues 
and candidates. I can vote for 
candidates who I believe will 
enact systemic change.

Voting 
has 
the 
potential 

to make change through the 
electoral process. At the very least, 
it can publicly signal approval 
or disapproval of a candidate or 
set of ideas. While a candidate or 
party may not satisfy all or even 
most of my policy preferences, 
I don’t believe it’s fair to let my 
ideals blind me from the reality 
others may face as a consequence 
of my non-voting. 

That being said, voter shaming, 

or bullying people into voting, 
does little to motivate non-
voters, often fails to recognize 
the 
difficulties 
and 
barriers 

that exist for many and can turn 
off people, even usual voters, 
from voting in the future. Voter 
shaming has taken many forms 
over the years, from callout posts 
on Instagram to postcards with 
voting records attached. This 
unproductive behavior should 
be modified. Recognizing any 
inherent privilege we may have 
and 
refocusing 
on 
positive 

motivations 
for 
voting 
will 

bring more people into the 
fold of electoral politics and 
democratic society.

While voting in national 

elections is a necessary civic 
duty, a functional democracy 
needs 
more 
than 
people 

showing up to vote once every 
four years. In our democratic 
republic, 
we 
elect 
officials 

who 
theoretically 
represent 

us in federal politics. After an 
election, we are left to consider 
members of Congress relatively 
unaccountable until their next 

election cycle. While we can’t 
recall members of Congress 
via election, contacting them 
about issues you care about by 
calling or writing their offices, 
sending emails or using services 
like ResistBot can actually have 
a significant effect on the way 
elected officials vote. I urge 
everyone to find issues they 
care about —whether they be 
racial justice in the United 
States, solidarity with Armenia, 
the environmental crisis or 
practically anything else — 
and call your congressional 
representatives daily or weekly. 

An action as simple as leaving 

a message for a staffer to pass 
along or having a conversation 
with a college intern, while 
both fun and frustrating, can 
ultimately push our Congress 
and democracy to listen more 
closely to the people it claims 
to represent. If we all took 
the four to six minutes of our 
day to make these calls, public 
officials would have no choice 
but to rethink some of their 
less favorable positions and be 
more representative of their 
constituents. 

In addition to conventional 

politics, 
activist 
work 
is 

imperative to steer our country 
and government to be one that 
is truly functional, healthy and 
just. Silence on issues that do 
not affect us directly is what 

created our current situation: a 
system that only supports those 
already in privileged groups. 
While I am not suggesting people 
spend the entirety of their free 
time taking to the streets to 
protest in person, it is crucial 
to consider the reality of those 
who have no choice but to do so 
to survive, like those targeted for 
their race or gender identity or 
those evicted from housing.

A multitude of options exist 

besides 
protesting: 
providing 

mutual aid, writing awareness 
pieces, 
having 
difficult 

discussions with friends and 
family, standing up for classmates 
and many other methods. I 
urge everyone to find ways 
to get involved in protesting, 
organizing 
or 
supporting 

the work of others. Work we 
do 
outside 
the 
conventional 

electoral norms, especially in 
terms of independent impact, is 
equally if not more important 
than what happens at the polls.

Looking for ways to get 

involved? 
There 
are 
plenty 

of 
brilliant 
initiatives 
and 

organizations at the University 
of Michigan and beyond that are 
working to create a more just 
and functional democracy, both 
through electoral politics and 
other means. The Prison Birth 
Project, a student organization 
that “aims to inspire students 
and community members to 
advocate 
for 
incarcerated 

mothers and birthing people,” 
is an example of a student 
organization 
working 
to 

better the community through 
participation. The PBP uses tools 
like pressuring elected officials 
into action and providing direct 
aid to help make the justice 
system actually judicial and 
aid incarcerated mothers and 
birthing people. Other advocacy 
groups like Students Demand 
Action and Students Demand 
Representation 
use 
similar 

methods to make their voices 
heard. These groups and efforts 
are what make democracy work 
beyond the use of the ballot.

Overall, 
participation 
in 

electoral processes and other 
avenues of engagement is vital 
to the health of our democracy. 
When we use our voice to help 
our peers in whatever capacity 
we can, we take another step 
toward creating a government 
by the people and for the people, 
and a society that truly values 
and respects all of its members. 
Like with our education, our 
democratic society will reap 
the benefits we sow. We need 
a student mindset of growth, 
change and constant learning 
to put our society on the right 
track. Get ready to vote, and get 
ready for what comes next.

uring the 12 years that 
followed the adoption 
of the Constitution, the 

two men who served as president 
were the nominally independent 
but Federalist-inclined George 
Washington, followed by his 
vice 
president, 
Federalist 

John 
Adams. 
During 
these 

administrations, 
an 
opposing 

party 
— 
the 
Democratic-

Republicans — solidified under 
the 
leadership 
of 
Thomas 

Jefferson and James Madison. 

In 
1800, 
the 
Democratic-

Republicans fielded Jefferson 
as 
their 
standard-bearer 
to 

oppose President Adams. The 
1800 presidential campaign was 
a notorious mudsling — perhaps 
one of the dirtiest presidential 
elections our republic has seen — 
and resulted in Jefferson’s victory 
over the incumbent Adams. The 
eyes of Americans, and the world, 
fell upon the capital. Would 
Adams and his Federalist allies 
cede their power? 

Adams 
and 
Jefferson, 
at 

this time, had a bitter personal 
rivalry, and it was matched by 
the political chasm between the 
Federalists 
and 
Democratic-

Republicans. But on March 4, 
1801, Jefferson was inaugurated 
as the third president of the 
United States without delay.

The 1800 presidential election 

is sometimes referred to as 
the “Revolution of 1800.” It is 
called this because it was the 
first time that power exchanged 
hands between parties at the 
national level, and crucially, it 
exchanged 
hands 
peacefully. 

The Federalists knew they had 

lost, and they respected the 

democratic process. It proved 
that the American Revolution’s 
republican drive — to this point 
untested — was realizable. The 
American 
experiment 
could 

work. 

220 
years 
and 
20 
such 

exchanges later, it appears that 
tradition could be in danger. 

President Trump has, on many 

occasions now, insinuated that 
the presidential election will be 
fraught with voter fraud from 
mail-in ballots. He has repeatedly 
claimed “the ballots are out of 
control,” called the ballots a 
“scam” and accused Democrats 
of harboring this knowledge. 

The president has even flirted 

with 
rejecting 
the 
electoral 

outcome should Joe Biden win 

on Nov. 3. When asked point 
blank during a White House 
press briefing in late September 
whether 
he’d 
commit 
to 
a 

peaceful transition of power, 
Trump 
gave 
an 
astounding 

answer: “Well, we’re going to 
have to see what happens.”

There is a right way, and 

only one right way, for a sitting 
U.S. president to respond to 
that question. “Of course, I 
am committed to a peaceful 
transition of power, just as every 
president before me. That’s the 
bedrock of American democracy. 
What a ridiculous question.”

Unfortunately for our nation’s 

proud republican legacy, that 
an American president may not 
concede defeat and voluntarily 
give up his power is a legitimate 
concern in 2020. Since 1800, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 

outbreak of the Civil War, our 
government has always accepted 
election results and willingly 
transferred power when defeated 
by an opposing party. Trump’s 
repeated failure to respect this 
legacy ought to shock and disgust 
every American.

The vast majority of what 

comes out of Trump’s mouth is 
bluster and nonsense. There is a 
real and frightening possibility, 
however, that he truly means 
what he’s saying here. But how 
would Trump’s rejection of a 
Biden victory theoretically work? 
And more importantly, could he 
actually pull it off?

Trump is already laying the 

groundwork for this sort of power 
grab. He’s started by discrediting 
mail-in voting, suggesting that it 
will lead to voter fraud of massive 
proportions (even though mail-in 
voting is one of the safest ways 
to vote right now.) We know 
that Biden voters are more likely 
than Trump voters to use mail-in 
voting for the upcoming general 
election. Trump knows this too, 
and should he lose, will likely use 
it to fuel the narrative that many 
mail-in votes were fraudulent. 
As such, Trump’s pre-planned 
narrative appears to be that a 
hypothetical Biden victory, the 
product of mail-in fraud, will be 
illegitimate. 

So, how exactly would Trump 

go about stealing the election? 
The answer is tied to our terribly 
flawed mechanism of electing 
presidents: the electoral college. 
According to the Constitution, 

individual 
state 
legislatures 

are charged with appointing 
electors to the electoral college. 
Historically, 
the 
winner 
of 

the popular vote in each state 
receives that state’s electoral 
votes. But — and this is the big 
but — state legislatures still 
reserve the right to select their 
own electors, regardless of the 
popular vote outcome. 

So, if Trump screams on Nov. 

4 that rampant voter fraud cost 
him the popular vote in key 
battleground states, it could 
potentially be followed by a 
recommendation 
that 
state 

legislatures appoint pro-Trump 
electors, so as to deliver the 
“correct” electoral result. In 
Michigan, 
Pennsylvania 
and 

Wisconsin 
— 
blue-leaning 

states that could deliver the 
decisive 
electoral 
votes 
for 

a Biden victory — both the 
State Houses and Senates are 
controlled by Republicans. If 
they “determine” that Biden 
won through fraudulent mail-
in votes and decide to “correct” 
the situation themselves, there’s 
a real scenario where they try to 
bypass election day results and 
deliver their electors to Donald 
Trump.

What is most disturbing about 

all of this is that massive voter 
fraud is absolute fiction. The 
apocalyptic 
scenario 
(already 

being peddled by Republican 
soothsayers) of rampant mail-
in fraud tainting the election 
in Biden’s favor is a design to 
mar a fair Trump loss. Don’t 
take my word for it. Take Ellen 
Weintraub’s word for it: As the 
commissioner of the Federal 
Election 
Commission 
said, 

“There’s simply no basis for the 
conspiracy theory that voting by 
mail causes fraud.”

That’s all this is. A conspiracy 

theory, peddled by Trump and 
promoted by Republicans, aimed 
at preemptively discrediting a 
legitimate Biden victory and 
stealing the election. At the 
end of the day, Trump and his 
minions don’t give a damn about 
our democracy. These folks are 
willing to lie — and in doing so, 
soil the democratic tradition 
America has had since 1800 — if 
it means keeping power. There’s a 
word for that: treason.

A

fter news broke that an 
anti-government militia 
had plotted to kidnap 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, I was 
sent a clip of an interview with 
Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf 
regarding the news of the arrest 
of Michael and William Null, two 
of the suspects in this case. Leaf 
knows William Null through a 
rally protesting Whitmer’s stay-
at-home order, which became a 
topic of conversation when Leaf 
was interviewed by Fox 17. 

When 
asked 
whether 
he 

regrets sharing a stage with 
someone charged in a plot to 
kidnap 
Whitmer, 
Leaf 
said, 

“It’s just a charge, and they say 
a ‘plot to kidnap’ and you got to 
remember that. Are they trying 
to kidnap … Because you can still 
in Michigan if it’s a felony, make a 
felony arrest.”

Leaf 
diminished 
the 

kidnapping attempt on Whitmer 
as an attempt of arrest. In 
the same interview, he uses 
a Michigan law that states 
that private persons can make 
arrests in certain situations to 
make this case. Leaf believes 
this kidnapping plot could be 
reasonable, 
and 
even 
legal, 

because of the anger towards 
Whitmer 
and 
her 
executive 

orders concerning COVID-19. 

This mindset in excusing a 

kidnapping attempt as a citizen’s 
arrest is the same mindset that led 
to the plot in the first place. There 
is a lack of faith in institutions 
that has led to a lack of trust in 
government. This distrust of 
American 
institutions 
comes 

from the severe polarization 
that exists in the United States 
today. People see the actions of 
members of the opposite party 
as illegitimate, which leads to 
suspicion of the institutions that 
allowed those actions to occur. 
Whitmer is a Democrat, while the 
people involved in the attempt to 
kidnap her are linked to a right-
wing militia group. 

The plot to kidnap Whitmer 

stems from a belief that the 
actions she took to prevent 
the spread of COVID-19 made 
her a tyrant and in violation 
of the Constitution. Because 
Whitmer was committing a 
crime, the men accused in 
this kidnapping plot believe 
they were taking legal action 
to arrest and try her for 
the crimes she committed. 
The 
view 
certain 
citizens 

have — that the institutions 
allowing Whitmer to make 
these executive orders are 
illegitimate — have created 
backlash 
against 
these 

institutions as we know them 
to exist. 

On May 6, the Michigan 

Legislature filed suit against 
Whitmer 
challenging 
her 

emergency orders regarding 
COVID-19 as “improper and 
invalid”; the plot to kidnap 
Whitmer began to take shape 
June 20, about a month and 
a half after. People who have 
faith in institutions do not 
subvert legal processes with 
illegal action. 

Not 
everyone 
defines 

legality the same way. The 
U.S. government and I do not 
believe that this attempt to 
kidnap the governor is legal. 
But others, such as Leaf, 
believe that rather than kidnap 
Whitmer, the accused might 
have been trying to arrest 
her for felony charges. This 
is not to say that Leaf’s views 
are valid, but because he is a 
sheriff and therefore someone 
in a position of authority, they 
cannot be dismissed. As law 
enforcement, sheriffs must be 
accountable to the law as it is 
interpreted by legal systems, 
not personal definition. 

This is why a lack of faith 

in 
our 
institutions 
is 
so 

dangerous. If people are not 
in agreement that we must 
respect our basic institutions, 

we live in a state of ambiguity 
about our laws. The role of the 
citizen is not to interpret the 
laws, but to change the laws 
they find unjust through other 
democratic functions. But what 
do we do when people disagree 
about 
what 
democratic 

functions are?

The suspects in the plot 

to 
kidnap 
Whitmer 
had 

previously expressed dissent in 
a constitutional and democratic 
way; the Null brothers were 
involved in protests in Lansing 
against Whitmer’s executive 
orders. Unfortunately for the 
Null brothers, concrete plans 
to kidnap a U.S. governor, or 
anyone, are not included in the 
right to protest. 

Our country will not be able 

to withstand a citizenry that 
does not respect its institutions. 
Intolerance 
encourages 
and 

enables people to engage in 
whatever activity they see fit 
because they do not believe 
in the legitimacy of American 
institutions. The motivation 
to behave in accordance with 
what our institutions mandate 
disappears when respect for 
them disappears. 

Belief that the government is 

illegitimate leads to dangerous 
ways of thinking. It allows 
people to think that illegal 
action they take is acceptable 
because the law itself is wrong. 
In the case of Whitmer, the 
suspects believe they could 
enforce the law, and define 
what terms in the law mean, 
because they disagree with the 
actions Whitmer took. 

In 
order 
for 
American 

society to remain stable, both 
citizens 
and 
government 

officials 
must 
respect 
our 

institutions and express our 
grievances through accepted 
means of dissent.

The wound that was never 
fatal: On ‘The Changeling’ 

The first time I found a 

copy of Joy Williams’s “The 
Changeling,” I was 19 and 
wandering around the public 
library searching for it — though 
I wasn’t aware of this yet. It was 
a few months before summer 
break and I was on the brink of a 
spectacular mental breakdown. 

This would be unexpected 

news for everyone, including 
myself, because I had my life 
perfectly 
compartmentalized, 

my days carefully cut and 
quartered and neatly wrapped. 
Every day I went to class and 
sat in the seats closest to the 
walls, and ate the same veggie 
sandwich at the same dining 
hall at exactly 5:30 PM, alone. 
I was working three jobs, 
doing private research with 
a professor, my GPA was way 
above average and I was so 
incredibly numb. Every weekend 
I would walk 40 minutes to the 
public library and pick books 
at random from the shelves 
— vapid romance novels, epic 
fantasies, ones that promised to 
teach me a foreign language in 
10 days. And I would let them sit, 
accusing and untouched, on my 
desk until they were due back 
home. Nothing really interested 
me but I was desperate to find a 
book to teach me how to feel so I 
went back again and again. 

“The Changeling” became the 

first book I finished in months. 

At surface value, its plot 

surrounds 
Pearl, 
a 
young 

alcoholic mother of a baby boy, 

Sam. She flees her first marriage 
to run away with Walker, her 
exciting lover, but ends up a 
widow in a devastating plane 
crash that only she survives. 
Pearl, and a child who looks 
like Sam but she is convinced 
is a changeling, a child who 
is 
secretly 
swapped 
with 

another in infancy. Pearl and 
this child begin living with 
Thomas, Walker’s brother, on 
an unnamed island inhabited by 
several adults and a seemingly 
endless number of children who 
sometimes seem more animal 
than human. Pearl finds herself 
becoming a sort of surrogate 
mother to these children, a role 
that she cannot understand. 
The children appear to love and 
torment her with equal amounts 
of fervor, which only hastens 
her loosening grip on reality 
and herself. With Sam and the 
other children of the island, 
Pearl feels an unbridgeable gap 
between them and herself as 
a maternal figure. Every day, 
Pearl drinks by the pool as the 
children clamber around her. 
They enthusiastically ask her 
questions about herself, the 
island, the world, but “... she 
had developed a trick to take 
herself out of their range … she 
concentrated, she rose in her 
mind, she moved of a distance. 
Her body would lie there, 
surrounded by the laughing 
children, but she would be gone. 
Having 
knowledge 
without 

knowing, her thoughts far away, 
her body there, but in darkness, 
stroked by the whispers of 
summer.” 

This novel reads as a sort of 

fever dream; with each page you 
are unsure of how much of the 
narrative is actually based in 
fact. It is a strange and dizzying 
landscape, one that captured me 
as soon as I reached this line — it 
was as if these were my words, 
my thoughts, laid out bare on 
this page: 

“She felt that if she could 

only get interested in and 
knowledgeable about a kinky 
subject, for example hockey 
or sharks, she would be a more 
contented person. She could not 
just be fucking all the time. Soon 
something more would have to 
happen. Pearl did not feel that 
she was a real person.”

That 
summer, 
just 
after 

coming home from college for 
break, the hole in my chest 
tore open and I became so sad 
that it hurt to even breathe. I 
stopped sleeping and eating, 
went on hours-long walks every 
night, just wandering around 
the woods behind my house in 
the dark listening to the same 
playlist on repeat. The bones in 
my chest and the knobs of bone 
in my shoulders surfaced, the 
skin on my face was peeled back 
so tight it was easy to picture 
what my bare skull looked like 
underneath. I looked inhuman. 
My skin was a gross yellow color, 
eyes bulging out of their sockets, 
fingers 
like 
claws, 
jagged 

spine like scales. I often found 
myself 
unable 
to 
recognize 

myself as I casually passed a 
reflective surface. My mother 
was distraught and confused as 
she held this creature, shaking 
with sobs again over nothing at 
all, nothing that it could name 

in any language. Why are you 
crying? she asked. Let me help 
you, what’s wrong?

My treatment center was 

quite far from us but my parents 
drove me there multiple times 
a week to get electricity zapped 
into my brain; it was an hour and 
a half’s drive across the Tappan 
Zee bridge, and I remember 
feeling choked up with rage and 
self-hatred, overwhelmed with 
guilt about making my parents 
have to miss work to drive me 
to a place that taught me how 
to feel human, how to do basic 
tasks that even infants know 
how to do. 

Like clockwork, I started 

crying as soon as my ass hit the 
car seat. 

I 
don’t 
understand, 
my 

mother said.

How could you love someone 

like me? I demanded. I was 
disgusted by everything about 
myself. I was coarse and twisted, 
ugly and helpless. 

I don’t know, she answered, 

But I still do. 

At the time, I heard that as “I 

have to.” Isn’t that what mothers 
are supposed to do? Provide the 
kind of love that blinds you, has 
you reaching into the dark, but 
stupidly unafraid? I was furious. 

How does it make sense to 

love 
something 
you 
cannot 

understand? 

“The 
Changeling” 
doesn’t 

make sense, but that was just 
what I needed. Love, fear, 
violence, joy all blend into an 
indistinguishable 
haze. 
The 

children quote Dante and plot 
murder, a boy pulls a length of 
Christmas lights and star tree 
topper out of his stomach. A man 
dreams of “[seizing his lover’s] 
throat with his jaws (to) worry it 
with joy until the bones [break] 
like seeds on his teeth.” Pearl’s 
vagina is compared to a wound, 
“the wound that opened again 
and again. The wound that was 
never fatal.” This same wound 
— the one that delivers Sam into 
the world — allows for them to 
“fold back the flaps of skin and 
unfold the baby from her like a 

bridal gown … her terrible dark 
wound [that would become] a 
nest for the flying creatures of 
the night.” 

When 
my 
mother 
was 

pregnant with me, she had a 
dream that she was fishing and 
caught three fish. The three fish 
were supposed to foretell me 
and my two sisters. She tells this 
story whenever she is feeling 
particularly sentimental. 

You were the biggest one, 

she’d tell me. You were the first 
and the most beautiful. And you 
were mine.

At the end of that summer 

my poor health landed me 
in the hospital with heart 
complications. The first night I 
had to run some tests, including 
an ultrasound of my chest. The 
technician smeared cold gel 
on my skin. In the monitor, my 
black and white heart stared 
back at me. It looked like the 
glassy eye of a fish, swimming 
around in its fluids.

When art meets algorithm: 
artists’ dual-edged sword

William Deresiewicz sees a 

crisis in the arts, and he needs you 
to stop it. Unfortunately, it’s not 
going to be that simple, because the 
problem comes from something 
that is increasingly woven into 
the fabric of our daily lives: The 
Algorithm. By “the algorithm,” 
Deresiewicz means the coding of 
apps and programs that we use 
every day to consume content, that 
show us certain posts or songs at 
the top of our feed — the invisible 
hand that, as Deresiewicz said, 
“picks up things that are already 
viral and makes them more viral.” 

Any non-Luddite knows that 

this is how the Internet works, 
and Deresiewicz himself will 
acknowledge that in some cases, 
the algorithm has been good for 
small artists who make it big 

seemingly overnight — think Lil 
Nas X or Rupi Kaur. But these 
artists are the exception, not 
the rule. Overwhelmingly, the 
algorithm swallows small artists 
whole, forcing them to the margins 
or completely eclipsing them with 
viral acts. In terms of seeing new 
artists, the power tips away from 
the audience and toward the big 
tech companies — all the while 
allowing us to think we are still in 
control. 

This is an uncomfortable reality 

for everyone, not just artists. The 
general public, the consumers 
of art, don’t want to think about 
art as something dictated by 
the market forces of large tech 
companies. After all, “the artist” 
is a quasi-mythic figure in our 
culture 
— 
moody, 
mysterious 

and 
Walden-esque. 
If 
talking 

about money in daily life is mildly 
unpleasant, talking about it in the 
arts is practically sinful. Artists 

are supposed to exist outside of the 
market, unmarred by capitalistic 
whims. Thinking about art in 
relation to money thus feels wrong, 
because we want our art to be 
above it all — to make commentary 
about economics, sure, but never 
participate in it. 

A truth we don’t like to apply to 

our artists, writes Deresiewicz in 
his book “The Death of the Artist: 
How Creators Are Struggling to 
Survive in the Age of Billionaires 
and Big Tech,” is that “wanting 
to get paid does not mean you’re a 
capitalist. It doesn’t even mean that 
you assent to capitalism. It only 
means that you live in a capitalist 
society.” But as long as artists exist 
in that capitalist society, and as 
long as they want to make art, they 
are part of a fundamental paradox 
that “cannot be resolved; it can 
only be endured.” 

Here lies the tension that 

today’s artists must endure — so 
how are they doing it? For his 
book, 
Deresiewicz 
interviewed 

hundreds of artists from a range 
of mediums, including music, 
writing, poetry and visual art. He 
doesn’t downplay the crisis he 
sees, explaining in his book that a 
title like “creative entrepreneur” 
for an artist is simply “sugar for 
the turd of gig work.” Most full-
time artists work paycheck to 
paycheck, piecing together funding 
from selling art, doing live events, 
Patreon (a subscription service for 
artists’ content) and other assorted 
income streams. This is because, he 
told The Michigan Daily, any artist 
“who wants to follow their own 
vision and be interesting and say 
what they want to say is going to 
be at odds with a system like that.” 
This means they probably won’t 
make much money — “and that’s 
the problem with the system.” 

Aside from making a compelling 

argument, Deresiewicz’s book also 
manages to create a nonfiction 
work 
of 
literary 
merit. 
His 

writing style is direct, just like his 
interviewing style; he has no time 
for you to waste, and he won’t waste 
yours. He writes without mincing 
words in a straightforward way 
that makes the reader trust what 
he has to say. He describes the 
Ramones, the Talking Heads and 
Blondie as “the archetypal three-
chord punk quartet, a cerebral 
art-school act, and a disco-scented 
dance band fronted by a singer 
with a cotton-candy voice.” A 
bland, purely informational voice

wouldn’t appeal to the bulk of 
people reading his work, a large 
percentage of whom are either 
middle class or upper-middle class 
people, or are artists themselves. 
His writing in the book manages 
to captivate both audiences, which 
is good, because those are exactly 
the people he most wants to reach. 
These are the ones who 
have 
been 
conditioned 

away from paying for art 
but who have the means to 
do so.

One thing that has made 

it 
infinitely 
harder 
for 

artists, along with everyone 
but the billionaires, is the 
pandemic. 
Deresiewicz’s 

book 
was 
written 
in 

2019, but he seemed to 
unfortunately 
predict 

the 
future 
when 
he 

wrote 
“People 
don’t 

make 
art 
in 
isolation, 

and 
online 
interactions 

are 
incomparably 

impoverished 
relative 

to those that take place 
in real life.” This year, to 
contextualize 
this 
new 

normal, 
Deresiewicz 

reached out to all of his interview 
subjects 
for 
the 
book 
and 

completed follow up interviews 
with ten. What he found was both 
completely expected and very 
distressing — “It’s been a disaster 
for the arts.” 

Deresiewicz’s 
entire 
book 

lays out how the digitization of 
art, especially music, has led to 
dramatically decreased revenue 
streams (think Spotify plays vs. 
CD sales). This reality has led 
many artists to rely on live events 
for money. Without income from 
those live events, many artists 
now struggle to make money off of 
their art, even after adjusting to the 
digitized art world. 

In addition, arts institutions 

from museums to theatres have had 
to close as a result of the pandemic. 
“A lot of them might not survive,” 
Deresiewicz said, “especially the 
smaller ones, the independent 
ones that produce interesting work 
and artists that are still getting 
traction.” Even revenue streams 

from day jobs like food service 
or Uber driving have dried up. 
Deresiewicz and his interviewees 
acknowledge that this could be a 
chance to reset the art world, but 
more likely is the notion that larger 
institutions will get larger, and 
smaller ones will get swallowed — 
the game of the algorithm playing 
out in real life.

The paradox of art and money 

is, 
according 
to 
Deresiewicz, 

inherently 
unsolvable 
in 
the 

current 
economy. 
Like 
other 

systemic issues, the power of the 
individual is limited. There is 
hope, though, for both consumers 
of art and for artists themselves. 
People have already become more 

conscious 
consumers 
of 
food, 

clothing, plastic water bottles and 
more — so, Deresiewicz argues, 
why not art? Often, he said, at 
“other end of the arts economy, 
of the supply chain, from you the 
consumer, is not a corporation” 
but rather an individual artist, 
struggling 
to 
make 
a 
living. 

Deresiewicz warned, “If 
you’re getting something 
valuable to you and you’re 
getting it for free, you really 
need to question that.” 

As consumers of art, we 

must learn to not expect art 
to be free (or simply equate 
exposure with payment). 
There is hope for artists as 
well. Young gen z artists, 
for example, despite having 
a complicated relationship 
with self-marketing, have 
a leg up in terms of pure 
online experience. They 
can use that experience 
to their advantage, says 
Deresiewicz, if they have 
good art — which comes 
from separating the online 
self from the “authentic” 
self. 

Deresiewicz’s 
culminating 

advice for young artists is simply 
this: “Instead of starting with the 
question ‘What can I make that’s 
going to get attention and make 
money?’, start with the question 
‘What do I want to make?’ and then 
make it, and then figure out how to 
get attention and hopefully money 
for it,” he said. 

Art first, promotion second. 

We must learn to seek out art that 
makes us think, that challenges us, 
that makes us cry or laugh or feel 
something — and then we have to 
pay the artist who makes it.

THE B-SIDE: PARADOX
Paychecks & paintbrushes

School 
of 
Music, 
Theatre 

and 
Dance 
alum 
Maya 

Ballester 
started 
her 
career 

at the University in the vocal 
performance program, but soon 
realized her heart lay closer to 
musical theatre. Through the 
Bachelor of Musical Arts track, 
she customized her degree to add 
acting and dance classes and then 
started work as a photographer as 
well. 

“It’s hard for me to tie down 

one thing that I want to do at a 
time,” Ballester said recently in 
an interview with The Daily over 
the phone from her native Kansas. 
She graduated last May, at the 
height of COVID-19’s first wave. 
Now, she joins the ranks of an arts 
industry endangered by and dying 
from the country’s mishandling 
of this pandemic. But those 
stressors aside, Ballester faces 
even deeper conundrums when it 
comes to personal income. 

“There’s this kind of switch 

that goes off in my head that when 
I am doing something for income, 
and to survive, it automatically 
becomes less fun, and becomes 
less expressive,” Ballester said. 
Her art comes from a place that 
she aches to keep separate from 
money — but without a paycheck, 
will she have the resources to 
make more art? 

Stamps and Music, Theatre 

& Dance senior Rhett Shepherd 
currently navigates a similar 
paradoxical 
question. 
Their 

senior 
thesis 
involves 
the 

development of a videogame that 
uses characters from diverse 
working-class 
communities, 

a group rarely represented by 
the white, straight and wealthy 
communities of online gaming. 
The project aims to fill a gap in 
representation, but Shepherd’s 
thesis must also reckon with 
the fact that videogames remain 
luxury products that are out 
of reach for many low income 
families. How can their art 
make the difference it intends to 
without access to the group that 
it’s made for? 

These questions leave both 

Shepherd and Ballester running 
in circles: Art and money compete 

for attention but also never seem 
to find a compromise. 

Stamps 
professor 
Rebekah 

Modrak is quite familiar with this 
paradox. As an artist, she makes 
work dedicated to the resistance 
of consumer culture — her “Re 
Made Co.” installment replaced 
Best Made Co.’s $350 artisanal 
designer axe with a $350 toilet 
plunger. The piece offered cutting 
humorous commentary on the 
absurd consumption of glorified 
tools and Modrak eventually 
received a cease and desist 
document from the company’s 
lawyers.

“Resistance 
to 
consumer 

culture 
was 
part 
of 
my 

upbringing,” Modrak recently 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily. Her parents started by 
teaching her to ask “why we pay 
companies money to advertise for 
them.” 

Now, as a professor, Modrak 

teaches the Stamps Interventions 
in 
Commerce 
class. 
This 

evolved from an older class on 
Shopdropping, a project in which 
students made false products 
to leave in a store — a reverse 
shoplift. The idea started in 2004, 
guided by Modrak’s question: 
“How can we take opportunities 
to encounter audiences outside 
of a gallery system, to introduce 
messages 
(critical, 
poetic, 

personal) contrary to the narrow 
conceptual 
boundaries 
of 

branding?” 

For Shepherd’s videogame, this 

separation starts by reimagining 
the power of ordinary objects, 
an 
idea 
that 
started 
while 

mopping the floor at a summer 
housekeeping job. 

“I look at this mop,” Shepherd 

said, “and I think to myself, 
‘this mop could be a really great 
weapon!’” The realization sent 
them into a world of imagined 
Expo marker jousts and cleaning 
pole lances, the result of which 
will 
become 
fully 
fledged 

working-class 
video 
game 

characters, aptly titled “The 
Working Clash.” 

Shepherd sees power in a choice 

like this, lifting the mundane 
into the creative, moving from 
mandatory to leisurely. The game 
will hopefully make space for 
products and professions often 

considered boring or less-than 
to take on new meaning beyond 
their measurable contributions to 
the economy. 

Finding 
space 
outside 

consumption 
is 
also 
quite 

important for Ballester. At home 
in 
quarantine, 
she 
watched 

the country’s economy melt, 
leaving millions to live on small 
unemployment checks. As the 
weeks turned to months, Ballester 
grew resentful of the system at 
large, maddened by America’s 
workaholic tendencies.

“I’ve grown very irritated with 

capitalism in general,” she said, 
“and how that has led to people 
defining who they are by their 
career, defining their worth by 
their career.” At the same time, 
this conclusion doesn’t solve her 
conflict — “I’m still struggling to 
form a healthy relationship with 
making money and also getting 
to do what I want to do,” she said. 

Shepherd echoed Ballester’s 

sentiment: “You can talk in circles 
about it for a long time,” they said, 
“I don’t really have a good answer 
for it.” 

For Modrak, the answer lies 

in actively disentangling oneself 
from consumer culture. “I used 
to exhibit [my work] in gallery 
spaces,” she wrote, but now 
it’s 
“intentionally 
net-based,” 

meaning it can reach any browser 
of a consumer space. The result 
gives 
Modrak 
independence 

and control over her own ideas 
and, according to her, is far more 
liberating. 

This 
idea 
holds 
special 

importance for Modrak now 
that we live in an age of “self-
promotional culture.” The growth 
of 
influencers 
and 
freelance 

artists pushes individuals to 
think of themselves as brands and 
thus “define success according to 
the narrow rationale of corporate 
culture,” she wrote. 

Ballester’s 
work 
in 
acting 

and 
photography 
are 
both 

heavily operated by such models 
of 
self-promotion 
— 
“you 

are your business,” she said. 
There are drawbacks to both, 
but 
performance 
work 
feels 

especially vulnerable to her.

THE B-SIDE: PARADOX
Love is a mess of paradoxes in ‘Eternal Sunshine’

“Oh, my darling, Clementine. 

You were lost and gone forever. 
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.” 

So croons Joel’s (Jim Carrey, 

“Dumb and Dumber”) mother 
as she bathes him in his distant 
memory of infancy in “Eternal 
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” 
It’s strange to think how you 
could know someone’s name 
from a song before you ever 
meet them. 

Of 
course, 
this 
is 
not 

not 
actually 
a 
coincidence; 

screenwriter Charlie Kaufman 
(“I’m 
Thinking 
of 
Ending 

Things”) chose this lullaby 
specifically to fit the narrative 
of his movie, but it’s not that 
far-fetched. 
We 
sometimes 

make up parallels in our lives 
with our loved ones even if they 
don’t make sense. Like Phoebe 
Bridgers 
wrote, 
“I 
didn’t 

know you then / And I’ll never 
understand why / It feels like I 
did.” 

“Eternal Sunshine” begins 

with Joel meeting Clementine 
(Kate 
Winslet, 
“Titanic”) 

on an impulsive day trip to 
Montauk. Joel is enamoured 
by Clementine’s boldness — 
the way that she invites him, a 
stranger, into the intimacy of 
her life and apartment. After 
spending a night together, the 
film abruptly cuts to what we’ll 
eventually realize is a flashback 
to when Clementine and Joel 
broke up, shortly before the 
opening of the film. Clementine 
went to a special medical clinic 
to have her memory of Joel 
erased from her brain, and, 
upon discovering this, Joel 
does the same to his memory 
of Clementine. The film follows 
Joel as he regrets trying to erase 
her, and they both eventually 

realize that even with all of 
their baggage, they’re willing 
to give their relationship one 
more shot. 

Even 
the 
mind-bending 

science-fiction angle of the film 
feels like something grounded 
in reality — who hasn’t ever 
wished they could, like Joel 

and Clementine, be strapped to 
an examination table and have 
your 
heartbreak 
surgically 

removed? 

The most painful moment 

for Joel wasn’t just the sight 
of Clementine walking out his 
door, but the moment when she 
acts like she has never (because, 
in her current consciousness, 
she hasn’t) met him before. 
It’s a science-fiction version 
of the universal fear that you 
can spend so much time in love 

with someone only to end up as 
strangers. That’s the paradox 
that really matters, not the non-
linear storytelling that begins 
the day after Joel has already 
had his memory erased. With 
no 
memory 
of 
Clementine, 

he meets his ex-girlfriend as 
if they are strangers, leaving 
a disconnect between their 
bodies and minds. After two 
years of love, they erase each 
other through a procedure that 
takes about as long as it might 
take you to finally block your 
ex’s number.

If the sentimentality doesn’t 

get you, the cinematography 
will. There are great visual 
paradoxes when Clementine 
walks down a street only to 
appear to return right where she 
began, like an urban Penrose 
staircase, or the Eldritchian 
version of Patrick (Elijah Wood, 
“Wilfred”), 
the 
man 
using 

knowledge of Joel’s memories 
to seduce Clementine, in a 
comatose nightmare sequence 
where, no matter how many 
times Joel turns him around, 
he never sees his face. 

But Kaufman’s portrayal of 

these inherent contradictions 
of the human condition isn’t just 
about the body horror of these 
faceless 
creatures 
in 
Joel’s 

dreams — it’s the way that Joel 
and Clementine are cosmically 
magnetized 
to 
each 
other. 

Though they’ve forgotten about 
each other, they remain drawn 
to each other. Their bodies 
could not forget. Perhaps this 
is 
because 
Mark 
Ruffalo’s 

(“Spotlight”) character fucked 
up the science, or maybe it 
means that we can’t ever really 
forget people as much as we 
want to, no matter how much 
we shill out for an experimental 
psychological study. 

Kaufman has something to 

say about the repressed feelings 

we hold in our bodies, too. Sex 
is probably the most intimate 
thing you can do with someone 
second only to, I don’t know, 
dying in their arms. But, in 
Kaufman’s 
film, 
Clementine 

uses it as a conversation starter 
— not to express any meaningful 
or established feelings. The 
implication in Joel’s vitriolic 
“I assume you fucked someone 
tonight. Isn’t that how you get 
people to like you?” is that she 
doesn’t have any depth to her 
personality, that she uses her 
body to get to know people. 

Avoiding the possibility of an 

argument about sex positivity, 
Kaufman uses this sequence 
to point out how weird it is 
that the bodies we’re in feel 
so separate from who we are 
inside our heads. Nearly the 
whole film is spent in Joel’s out-
of-body experience during the 
procedure. Maybe Joel thinks 
(while 
Clementine 
denies 

that she’s at all promiscuous) 

that Clementine sees physical 
nakedness as less incriminating 
than emotional vulnerability, 
or maybe she sees her body and 
her mind connected in a way 
that Joel can’t. When her mind 
tells her body that she wants to 
eat off of Joel’s plate the first 
time they meet, she does. 

“It was so intimate,” Joel 

recalls 
about 
the 
bizarre 

moment. “Like we were already 
lovers.”

There’s a scene where Joel 

and Clementine venture out 
onto a frozen lake to lie down 
and stargaze. The frozen lake is 
revisited multiple times, even if 
the characters don’t realize it.

“What if it breaks?” Joel 

asks.

“‘What if?’ Do you really care 

right now?” Clementine says.

Is the ice going to crack? Is 

the view of the stars worth the 
risk of hypothermia? Is the love 
worth the heartbreak? It’s the 
paradox of loneliness when you 

know how much it hurts to be 
with someone who hurt you, 
but you still want it anyway; 
of knowing no one can force 
feelings of love but still hurting 
when they don’t love you back; 
of Valentine’s Day intending to 
be all about love, but ending 
up being about heartbreak; of 
everyone having the shared 
experience of childhood but 
somehow forgetting how lonely 
it is to be a kid when you finally 
grow up.

All we’re supposed to want 

is survival. We’re supposed to 
shave off anyone who might 
hold us back. But instead we 
go against all our instincts 
to protect ourselves when we 
choose to love someone, even 
with all their weaknesses laid 
out on the surgical table. Maybe 
love is the ultimate paradox.

THE B-SIDE: PARADOX
The true tragedy of snob

NINA MOLINA
Daily Arts Writer

In 
his 
1988 
poem 

“Introduction 
to 
Poetry,” 

Billy Collins laments the way 
his students have been taught 
to read poetry. Rather than 
“hold it up to the light like a 
color slide,” or “press an ear 
against its hive,” he writes 
that 
the 
students 
torture 

a confession — in this case 
meaning or significance — out 
of the poem. Once they have 
found its meaning, analyzed 
its metaphors and discussed 
its themes, they leave. 

Collins 
hates 
this; 
he 

wants the experience of art 
appreciation to be as ongoing 
as the admiration of nature in 
everyday life. 

I agree with him. As one 

learns more about a subject 
— in this instance, art — the 
less one seems to appreciate it. 
This is the paradox of the snob. 
Critics and experts’ knowledge 
about art ultimately lead to 
bitterness and disillusionment 
about the direction of that 
particular art form. Slowly, 
the initial passion for the form 
is replaced with unending 
criticism. 

We are taught to approach 

art in this paradoxical manner. 
In my creative writing classes, 
I’ve learned to employ the 
syntax 
of 
Alice 
Munro, 

Raymond Carver and Alice 
Walker; we read the words 
and then tear them apart and 
put them back together in 
carefully 
crafted 
academic 

prose of analysis. But I don’t 
want to tear the story into 
shreds 
of 
clever 
sentence 

turns, front versus backstory 
and particular verb usages.

I wonder when I’ll start 

seeing 
writing 
as 
work. 

Perhaps 
that’s 
what 
the 

best artists do — they have 
routine and practice, what 
outsiders conflate with divine 
inspiration. Walking the line 
between creating a writing 
routine while also giving in 
to the whims of inspiration is 
tricky. 

Perhaps therein lies my 

question: 
Why 
does 
art 

criticism exist if it turns us, 
the art critics and consumers, 
into 
cynical 
curmudgeons, 

ready to attack any artist, 
musician or writer? 

In 
one 
of 
my 
English 

classes, we’re learning about 
Romantic-era literature. At 
the 
peak 
of 
19th-century 

Romanticism, 
nature 
and 

emotion became art’s purpose. 
And, for the first time in 
literary history, art’s purpose 
became 
oppositional 
from 

societal, morality and value 
systems. 

We just finished reading 

Johann 
Wolfgang 
von 

Goethe’s “The Sorrows of 
Young 
Werther,” 
the 
1774 

German novel about a young 
man’s infatuation with an 
unavailable girl that leads to 
his suicide. Werther’s foray 
into the reality of unrequited 
love is painful to watch, even 
with Goethe’s beautiful prose. 
And yet, the epistolary novel 
is flooded with reasons to 
continue loving the world, 
despite the trials and pain 
that 
they 
bring. 
Though 

Werther is no exemplar on 
how 
to 
handle 
romantic 

rejection, 
his 
youthful 

intensity and sensitivity are 
highly admirable. He writes 
to his best friend, “I am proud 
of my heart alone, it is the 
sole source of everything, all 
our strength, happiness and 
misery. All the knowledge 
I possess everyone else can 
acquire, but my heart is all 
my own.” This vulnerability 
to the world is enjoyable and 
interesting to watch unfold, 
but it’s also a virtue that us art 

consumers can — and should 
— learn. 

As an English major, I live in 

constant fear of becoming this 
snob. I worry I will approach 
every piece of literature I 
pick up ready to annotate the 
margins and always keeping 
the 
essay 
prompt 
at 
the 

forefront of my mind. But, I 
agree with Collins when he 
writes that he would rather 
“walk inside the poem’s room 
and feel the walls for a light 
switch” than beat a meaning 
or significance out of a poem. 

It 
seems 
some 
art 

enthusiasts 
find 
comfort 

in that they are the few 
“chosen” followers who are 
enlightened enough to have 
better taste. I’ve encountered 
people who correct the way 
you say Van Gogh. They are 
the ones who gasp at you 
for not knowing that the 
drummer of Nirvana was the 
lead singer of the Foo Fighters 
and book-shame you for not 
having 
read 
“Fahrenheit 

451,” 
“Slaughterhouse-Five,” 

“Frankenstein” or any Oscar 
Wilde. But I have yet to find 
joy in being the “select” few. 

In some ways, this makes 

me excited to have space away 
from this kind of analysis 
after my formal education. I’m 
determined to never let go of 
that excited, playful state of 
being enraptured in a novel. 
Like Werther, I’d be sorry to 
lose the beauty of nature in 
the name of art.

BOOK REVIEW
TV REVIEW

Review : ‘Anxious People’ Review: ‘The Right Stuff’

Most of us like to think we 

have a handle on our lives. We 
make careful plans, we budget, 
we organize, all so that when we 
come home after a long day, we 
have the peace of mind to enjoy 
a few moments of relaxation 
before getting back to business 
the next day. But deep down 
everyone knows that at any point, 
catastrophe can strike forcefully 
enough to reduce the calmest 
and most level-headed of us to 
a state of sheer panic. If that 
wasn’t evident before, it certainly 
has been since the COVID-19 
pandemic began. Still, this isn’t 
something we openly talk about, 
and perhaps for good reason. It 
would certainly be a bad idea to 
invite your friend out to lunch, 
then casually remind them that 
there’s a non-zero possibility 
someone will call in the next five 
minutes and inform them that 
their sibling has been hit by a bus. 
Of course, we’re still reminded 
every once in a while that this 
and any number of life-changing 
events 
could 
occur 
at 
any 

moment. Reminders like these 
can cause people to do stupid 
things like trying to rob a cashless 
bank and then accidentally hold 
hostage a group of prospective 
buyers at an apartment viewing, 
which happens to be the plot 
of 
Fredrik 
Backman’s 
novel 

“Anxious People.”

The novel takes on a third 

person narrative structure that 
distributes its attention evenly 
between twelve characters who 
are all somehow involved in 
the hostage situation. There’s 
the bank robber, a father-son 
cop duo, a real estate agent, a 
newly engaged couple, a middle 
aged couple, an elderly lady, a 
struggling actor, a therapist and 
a bank executive whose collective 
anxieties 
result 
in 
easily 

avoidable stress and confusion. 
Though 
ostensibly 
about 
a 

hostage situation, the real content 
of the novel is the frequent 

flashbacks that reveal trauma in 
the characters’ pasts. Each step 
of the main action is interrupted 
by a flashback that explains why 
a character made the strange or 
poor decision they did. 

This method sounds confusing, 

but it’s surprisingly elegant in 
practice. The characters, though 

a bit flat at times, all feel distinct 
and easy to keep track of. There 
are few points where the reader 
feels lost. The novel’s clarity is 
in part due to Backman building 
an intentionally confusing and 
stressful scene to demonstrate 
the 
characters’ 
anxieties 

before revealing a small piece 
of information that comically 
deflates the situation and lowers 
the stakes. Backman does this 
frequently 
enough 
that 
the 

reader can start reading about a 
convoluted scenario with the trust 
that it will soon be resolved. This 
allows Backman to progressively 
heighten the confusion toward 
the climax of the novel without 

losing the reader. 

The 
narrator 
regularly 

pokes fun at the characters’ 
predicament, 
but 
with 
a 

compassionate tone that never 
ridicules and instead functions 
as a reminder that they’re all 
fundamentally okay. It is this 
delicate 
balance 
that 
allows 

Backman to construct scenes 
with real emotional weight in a 
story that’s essentially a comedy. 
There are only a few points 
where this balance slips. Jack, the 
younger police officer witnessed 
a suicide when he was younger. 
He later runs into someone else 
about to jump from a bridge and 
is able to talk them out of it. These 
two incidents are part of why he 
decides to become a police officer. 
These memories cause him a 
lot of distress throughout the 
novel, but the way this subplot 
gets tied up in the end feels over 
the top. Up until this scene, 
Backman does a good enough job 
of creating scenes with emotional 
depth out of situations with far 
lower stakes, but using suicide 
to heighten the emotionality of 
the scene felt unnecessary. There 
is also a scene where Zara, the 
bank executive, is speaking with 
her therapist and they have an 
incredibly interesting back and 
forth where they each struggle to 
take control of the conversation 
and avoid talking about what the 
other wants them to talk about. 
Then, at the very end of the 
conversation, the therapist plainly 
states what Zara is worried about, 
even though the scene itself 
demonstrates it clearly without 
beating the reader over the head 
with “the point.” These are, 
however, relatively minor issues 
that don’t significantly hurt the 
reading experience.

“Anxious People” is about 

compassion. It is about characters 
in distress who learn to use love 
instead of force to solve problems. 
The novel is especially salient 
today, when it seems like every 
week there’s a new anxiety-
inducing world event. It gives 
us a blueprint for how to love 
each other in the midst of chaos. 

DIGITAL CULTURE 
Born on the internet: video sharing for the soul

It’s hard to imagine a time 

when watching videos on the 
internet was not a simple, 
unified process. I certainly 
can’t, my youth allowed me to 
skip the era of downloading 
the latest 240p movie trailer 
from the Pirate Bay using dial-
up internet, feeling the joy 
and anticipation of the prize 
waiting for you in forty-five 
minutes — wait, no now it’s 
twenty, but now it’s an hour, 
well maybe just sleep and 
watch it when you wake up. By 
the time I discovered the joys 
of watching videos, the whole 
process was much simpler: go 
to YouTube.com. 

Oh, 
YouTube 
circa-2010, 

a 
wonderland 
of 
emerging 

content 
creators 
pioneering 

a field that seemed at once 
impossible 
and 
tantalizing: 

people were being paid to make 
videos for a living. These were 
the proto-influencers, spending 
their days making comedic 
videos with their best friends, 
raking 
in 
the 
cash. 
Some 

channels like Rocket Jump 
Productions 
were 
pumping 

out 
Hollywood-level 
videos, 

while others got popular by 
parodying a popular song. This 
was the golden era of YouTube, 
the era of Ryan Higa, Shane 
Dawson, Ray William Johnson 
of =3 and, most importantly to 
my life, Smosh. 

The power duo of Anthony 

Padilla and Ian Hecox shook 
the world with their Pokémon 
theme song lip-sync and found 
success week in and out with 
skits and parodies. These two 
teens from southern California 
suddenly found out, not only 
that their voices mattered, but 
also that people wanted to hear 
them. Whether it was Food 
Battle, Boxman or one of their 
million parodies or “if BLANK 
were real” videos, audiences 
craved the content Smosh put 

out every Friday, and I was 
right there with them. I still 
remember following the launch 
of Smosh Games, bringing in a 
whole new crew and jumping 
into let’s plays, the new hot 
thing on the video-sharing site. 
Fall 2012, New Jersey ravaged 
by Hurricane Sandy, and there 
I was, on my phone using my 
Dad’s data hotspot to watch the 
latest “Boss Fight of the Week.” 

Thanks to recommendations, 

I roamed around the gaming 
side of YouTube, stumbling 
through 
Pewdiepie 
and 

TobyGames to find JonTron 
and PeanutButterGamer. These 
videos weren’t merely wastes 
of time for me, they were my 
vice. A video while I ate a 
pre-homework snack, a few 
episodes of the Completionist 
before bed, it didn’t matter if 
I knew the games they were 
talking about, I was intoxicated 
by what they were doing. After 
years of viewing, I wasn’t 
content 
on 
staying 
to 
the 

sidelines — I had to be a part of 
this somehow.

So I bought a recording device 

and a microphone and roped 
my best friend into starting a 
YouTube channel with me. The 
wistful, ignorant blessing of 
youth. Late one August day we 
sat in my basement, Audacity 
running on my rundown laptop, 
and played “Mario & Luigi: 
Superstar Saga” on the Wii U. It 
only got better from there.

Snow, rain or shine, whenever 

I could gather my friends to 
record, all crammed onto my 
small couch in my basement, 
we would do it. Now, don’t get 
around thinking I was popular: 
We capped off at 80 subscribers 
and never grew from there. 
Frankly, I’m still surprised 
knowing people watched four 
high schoolers struggle to tell 
jokes and fail at playing “New 
Super Mario Bros. Wii.” Some 
of them were friends, some 
were strangers, but they all 
gave us a chance. I gave my all 
into this channel, convincing a 

friend to edit the videos while 
I was learning the ropes, or 

having another one essentially 
be our brand manager as I ran 
new show ideas by them on a 
nearly daily basis. I paid an 

artist for assets, learned how 
to (barely) use Photoshop and 
tried, and so very badly, but 
inevitably failed, at sticking 
to a schedule of two videos a 
week. There was nothing that 
would stop me from being the 
next Pewdiepie, y’know that 
except I wasn’t Swedish and 
the YouTube algorithm doesn’t 
benefit small channels in the 
slightest. 

In 
the 
end, 
my 
gaming 

channel was me and three 
other people, all of whom 
are now some of my absolute 
closest friends, spending four 
years 
goofing 
around 
and 

playing games together. We 
were never successful, we were 
absolutely the furthest thing 
from it, but that never stopped 
the process from being a blast. 
Every recording session was 
an excuse to spend hours with 
friends, either failing at getting 
through World 9 of “NSMBW” 
or playing “The Evil Within” at 
2 a.m., and looking back now, 
I could never ask for anything 
more. YouTube gave me the 
chance to try something new 

and insane and find a passion 
for creation while doing it. It 
allowed me to learn skills I 
use to this day, it bonded my 
friends into a family and above 
all else, it let me live a dream. I 
may not have ever reached the 
heights of SkydoesMinecraft, 
but that didn’t matter to me. 
I’m grateful for the experience 
I had.

When YouTube was at its 

best, it wasn’t a vehicle for Late 
Night Show clips or dozens of 
useless advertisements. It was 
the Wild West, inviting people 
from all over to throw their hat 
into the ring to be the next big 
thing. The only bad idea was 
one you didn’t try. People rose 
and fell overnight, but everyone 
put their hearts and souls into 
it and, most importantly, had 
fun doing it. 

I miss the old YouTube. Sure, 

I go on the app daily and still 
subscribe to people putting 
out quality content, but it’s 
different. Now, people rely on 
sponsorships and Patreon so 
they can do the thing they most 
enjoy— somehow it became a 

true job to do what you love. I’m 
lucky to have found YouTube 
when 
I 
did, 
this 
magical, 

mythical place that encouraged 
everyone to lie about being 18 
and take a shot. Make that let’s 
play. Do that make-up tutorial. 
Write 
that 
long, 
wholly 

unnecessary essay about why 
“National Treasure” is a classic 
and deserves a third movie. 
Everyone had the platform to 
do whatever they wanted, it 
really put the you in YouTube. 

Let’s all take a moment 

to take a deep breath and 
remember that terrible, funny, 
sincere viral video or favorite 
Smosh song (I’m partial to 
“Firetruck!”) 
and 
remember 

a lighter, weirder time on 
the 
internet. 
Think 
about 

if 
Dr. 
Seuss 
beat 
William 

Shakespeare in that epic rap 
battle. Pour one out mentally, 
or physically if you’d like, for

Have you ever wanted to 

explore the minds of people 
you don’t normally see on 
TV? To challenge what you 
know about our country’s 
history, and to see one of the 
most significant moments in 
humankind from a whole new 
perspective?

If you answered yes to 

any of these questions, do 
not watch the new Disney+ 
anthology series “The Right 
Stuff.” It won’t give you any of 
the above.

Based on Tom Wolfe’s 1979 

book of the same name and 
the 1983 movie adaption, “The 
Right Stuff” is a historical 
drama about the United State’s 
first 
team 
of 
astronauts, 

known as the Mercury Seven. 
As these hard-working average 
Joes 
prepare 
to 
change 

history, they become instant 
American celebrities and must 
deal with the scrutiny that the 
newfound fame brings upon 
their families. 

The 
main 
conflict 
is 

between John Glenn (Patrick 
J. Adams, “Suits”) and Alan 
Shepard (Jake McDormand, 
“Watchmen”). Both men are 
members 
of 
the 
Mercury 

Seven, and out of their mutual 
desire to become the first 
American to travel into space, 
they 
form 
a 
competitive 

rivalry. While Glenn is the 
perfect 
family 
man 
with 

charm and charisma, Shepard 
is the rogue bad boy who 
hooks up with “chicks” and 
then leaves them to fulfill his 
American duty. It’s a conflict 
that feels just as played out 
and tired as a 2020 show about 
the Space Race should.

To the show’s credit, none 

of it feels sloppy or unsure 
of itself. It knows who its 
target audience is, and it gives 
them everything they want: 
cool cars, pretty women and 
unbridled patriotism. Every 

scene tries so desperately to 
amaze the audience that even 
reading the amount of people 
on a signup sheet is met with 
an over-dramatic score. 

Essentially, if you asked 

every white dad in America 
what 
their 
favorite 
movie 

moments 
were, 
and 
then 

forced 
a 
bot 
to 
write 
a 

screenplay based on those 
moments, 
you’d 
have 
the 

groundwork. 

The most surprising aspect 

of “The Right Stuff” is its 
ability to pass the Bechdel test. 
Halfway into episode two, 

Annie Glenn (Nora Zehetner) 
and Trudy Cooper (Eloise 
Mumford, 
“Fifty 
Shades”) 

discuss 
the 
hardships 
of 

marrying an astronaut and 
their personal goals. It’s an 
honest attempt to finally give 
the women some agency. Only, 
that’s exactly how it feels. 
After over an hour of white 
men 
mansplaining 
bravery, 

this “girl power” moment is 
comically 
disingenuous. 
It 

isn’t inherently problematic 
or ill-spirited. It’s just poor 
writing.

Certainly, 
stories 
like 

this 
are 
not 
worthless 

or 
insignificant. 
Their 

monumental roles in shaping 
the history of the country 
are 
undeniable, 
and 
the 

impact they made on people is 
immeasurable. However, these 
are the exact stories we have 
been told over and over again 
without any new perspective. 
In the modern era, another 
show that celebrates white 
male 
American 
history 

without a single reservation 
isn’t just irrelevant — it’s 
blissfully ignorant. 

As one of the first adult-

oriented shows on Disney+, 
2020’s 
“The 
Right 
Stuff” 

is 
a 
hugely 
generic 
and 

unnecessary adaptation. As 
we enter the new decade, let’s 
leave “stuff” like this behind.

There is

T

he music is loud and the room is 
dark, lit up only by banal string 
lights dangling on the side of the 

wall. There are guys playing beer pong in a 
brighter part of the house, showing off and 
making drunken noises. In the tiny kitchen 
where the counter is filled with red cups and 
variations of alcohol, sorority girls throw up 
in the sink as their sisters kindly hold up their 
hair behind them. 

You are surrounded by a room full of people, 

kissing and grinding against each other. Your 
friends are already drunk and dancing on the 
platform with some frat boy you have never 
met before. You try to vibe along with the beat 
— a rap song that you hear on the radio all the 
time but don’t know the name of. Even though 
you want to head home, you are not sure if 
walking the streets alone at 12 a.m. is the best 
option for a girl.

That’s when your eyes meet. Another pair of 

anxious yet curious eyes across the dance floor 
catch your gaze, longing for comfort in a crowd 
of strangers. You reach a tacit agreement and 
unconsciously move toward the door together. 
After a quick self-introduction, he offers to 
walk you back to your house, indulging in the 
get-to-know-you questions and even a little 
banter. Before you part, you exchange phone 
numbers and a kiss.
T

his would be a common, cheesy 
scene of “love at first sight” from 
any typical 2000s romantic comedy 

movie. Of course, this has not happened to me, 
or anyone that I know for that matter — though 
young women have plenty of awkward experi-
ences with men who suddenly start grooving 
next to them at a party, only to ask for their 
number. 

Nevertheless, the media has always 

placed emphasis on the initial encounters of 
intimate relationships. Two complete strang-
ers are expected to be magically brought to-
gether by serendipitous incidents: bonding 
over The Smiths in an elevator ride to work, 
meeting in a local travel bookshop in a for-
eign country, kissing a stranger to prevent 
an embarrassing confrontation with a past 
crush.

While these scripted scenes inevitably dic-

tate our expectations of romance, I couldn’t 
help but wonder how realistic they are in our 
ordinary lives. As technology becomes more 
integrated into our social life, are the oh-so 
desired “organic” encounters possible? What 
is the likelihood that we will find “the one” 
amid the rise of COVID-19 cases on campus 
and enforced social distancing protocols?

The most recent data shows that even in a 

pandemic, young people are not giving up on 
their chance at romance. Dating apps owned by 
Match Group —Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc. — 
have all experienced a direct growth in revenue 
since March 2020. College students have also 
become more creative with the ways they build 
intimate relationships, with people going as 
far as designing a Zoom dating site or a match-
ing survey algorithm to battle social isolation. 
While the creations of these technologies were 
well-intentioned, many users complained of a 
lack of success due to the short nature of online 
conversation.

I could easily see why. As someone who suf-

fers from extreme Zoom fatigue and online so-
cial anxiety, I have always had my doubts about 
building meaningful relationships through 
technology. However, my inner romantic of-
fered a shimmer of hope, peeking through a 
crack in my skeptical heart and prompting me 
to properly investigate my questions. In turn, I 
spoke to five people regarding their experience 
with dating apps, long-distance relationships 
and chasing love during a pandemic.
T

he first person I spoke to was LSA 
senior Emma Carter, who met her 
girlfriend, Annie, on Hinge. On the 

Sunday morning of our interview, I rolled out 
of bed and rushed to Zoom. Emma arrived at 
our meeting a few minutes later in a gray zip-
up hoodie, much more awake and refreshed 
than I was.

I started off with the basics, asking about 

why she got the application and what she 
wanted from it. Emma explained that she first 
downloaded Hinge when studying abroad for a 
semester in Barcelona. She was never intend-
ing on finding a relationship through the app, 
as she is “not a huge fan of online dating,” but 

instead downloaded it just to meet new people. 
When asked about why she selected Hinge 
over other popular apps, she explained, “I 
wasn’t really looking for a relationship neces-
sarily, but I don’t like Tinder. It kind of just im-
plies a hookup and that’s not what I am really 
interested in.”

While the two apps belong to the same par-

ent company, Match Group, Tinder and Hinge 
serve entirely different purposes. Whereas 
Tinder is mostly known as the “hookup app,” 
especially among college students, Hinge is 
for people who look for a deeper connection. 
Nevertheless, the two share a similar demo-
graphic, with their core users being millen-
nials ranging from the age of 18 to people in 
their 20s. 

“Hinge is a really good one because it’s not 

just about how a person looks,” Emma elabo-
rated. “On Tinder, it can just be like ‘hey you’re 
cute.’ That’s how the conversation starts and 
there’s not much to talk about with that. (On 
Hinge) when there are these preliminary 
questions, it is easier to generate more organic 
conversations about something real.”

Though Emma has always been a little skep-

tical about dating apps, a conversation with her 
dad’s coworker completely changed her per-
spective. He told her that if he were a young 
person in this pandemic, he would “100% use 
dating apps.” The ongoing COVID-19 pandem-
ic forces people into quarantine and smaller 
social circles, giving way to intense feelings of 
loneliness and isolation. Public health officials 
have even recommended wearing a mask when 
engaging in sexual activities with individuals 
outside one’s social pod.

However, the forced absence of physical 

contact and need for social distancing has also 
hindered people from forming serious rela-
tionships. When asked about how she makes 
efforts to maintain her relationship in this 
pandemic while protecting those around her, 
Emma shared her own experience. 

“I think it’s definitely respectable to sus-

pend online dating during the pandemic right 
now, though I don’t know if we could suspend 
meeting new people forever,” she explained. 
She additionally pointed out the importance 

of being socially-aware and transparent in her 
and Annie’s communication.

“I am not necessarily freaked about get-

ting COVID-19,” Emma said. “I am freaked out 
about spreading it. (Annie and I) are working 
together really well to minimize any risks of 
doing that. At the end of the day, we don’t see 
many people.”

Emma told me that despite having found a 

serious partner through a dating app, she re-
mains skeptical about the effectiveness of these 
technologies. She is convinced that if she and 
Annie met in person instead of through Hinge, 
they still would have been together. 

“In person personalities play a huge role 

in attraction to individuals, and I don’t think 
you can get that through these apps,” Emma 
explained. “I didn’t think I was going to find 
someone I like this much from online dating. 
I don’t like the idea that much, but it worked 
out.”
T

he next person who I talked to was 
LSA senior Kate Kachmer, who is 
one of Emma’s housemates. How-

ever, unlike Emma, her experience with Hinge 
was not at all successful. Kate felt a sense of a 
fear of missing out and loneliness while quar-
antining with her siblings, who are both in seri-
ous relationships. With the constant romance 
in front of her face and the future of socializing 
appearing uncertain, Kate decided to finally 
give dating apps a shot. 

However, after setting up her profile, she 

found Hinge’s set of personal trivia questions 
insufficient and inauthentic. Like icebreakers 
before a meeting, Hinge’s set of profile prompts 
were created to spark conversations, with 
T.M.I.-style prompts like “a shower thought 
that I recently had.” 

“Anyone could look through a list of ques-

tions and send it to their friends and ask ‘what’s 
a funny response to put,’” Kate explained. “It’s 
more like who has the best one-liner they can 
put in response to a prompt and make someone 
like them.”

I 

came to the University of Michigan because film 

students here actually get to shoot on film. At most 

other institutions, the only cameras available are 

digital. So much of what’s important to me about my stud-

ies and this art form is linked to shooting physical film.

Film’s hallmark is the physical grain it leaves on an im-

age. What is between those particles? What does it mean 

to say “We’re shooting this on film,” or using any analog 

technology for that matter? To better understand these 

questions, I spoke with two former teachers and asked 

them to go more in depth about why they teach and use 

analog technology and what it means to them artistically 

and philosophically. 

Terri Sarris is a Film, Television, and Media (FTVM) 

professor at the University. She was the first person to put 

a working, 16mm movie camera 

in my hands — a Canon Scoopic. 

Standing there in the basement of 

North Quad Residence Hall, about 

five students to one camera, I 

thought about the scraps of 35mm 

negatives and little Kodak slides 

littered around my family home 

and in every drawer. 

When I was little, I’d hold them 

up to the light and see my parents 

looking so young and cool, wear-

ing sunglasses in their cream-col-

ored apartment. In the basement, 

we had huge, sealed flat metal can-

isters where reels of footage, my 

dad’s film, lived. My friends and I 

would peek over my fuzzy orange 

couch while our parents watched 

the film after dinner. When I got 

older, my dad let me see them for 

real. They were so unlike anything 

else that existed — yellow and in-

viting and alive. 

Back in the North Quad base-

ment, Terri instructed us on how 

to focus the cameras and make 

sure they were at the right set-

tings for the lighting. I knew I had 

to listen to every word she said 

because she was finally explaining 

how to make something yellow, 

and inviting, and alive. 

Terri explained how special the 

first day using film cameras with a 

new class is special to her, too. 

“Usually students have had lit-

tle or no exposure to it and so it’s 

actually, for a lot of people, really 

exciting,” she said in our Zoom 

call. “It also can be sort of mysti-

fying ... it’s such an amazing piece 

of equipment.”

Terri chooses to teach 16mm 

film not just because it is a prac-

tical skill for the industry, but 

because she sees an artistic, me-

thodic value in the physicality of 

shooting, cutting and splicing. In 

fact, the intentionality is twofold: in terms of film theory 

and historical context. 

“The idea of film as a physical medium really gives stu-

dents, I hope, an appreciation for the decades of people 

who worked on film before digital was developed,” she 

said. “You think about from the very earliest days of the 

Soviet filmmakers shooting those amazing films on film. 

And then all the editors — a lot of women, by the way.” 

There is a sense of purpose with film. No matter what 

you make, you’re making it with the same tools that very 

serious, talented people have been using since the start. 

It makes me feel like they’re with me while I am filming 

— as if I’m making something not just for, but also with, 

the Soviets and women. It makes me feel like my eyes get 

to see through the same machine and glass lenses as the 

people from the past.

Along with the historical intention behind analog tech-

nology, there is a specific effect from using it too, Terri 
explained.

“I think it makes you really consider an edit and timing 

and pacing … it really is part of the palette of filmmaking,” 

she said. “(Shooting on only digital) would be like taking 

some colors away from an artist.” Listening to her, I start-

ed to understand. Yes, film is a kind of communion or time 

travel, but it’s also a choice at the present moment, like 

any other variable a filmmaker can manipulate. 

She explained how in her own work, the choice of film 

stock is part of the way her projects relate to the past. Dif-

ferent film stocks have different dimensions, sensitivities 

to light, and color balances. For her films, where she uses 

toys to act out short stories, she uses 16mm. 

“I shoot them on 16 partly because it’s a legacy tech-

nology, and then I always make the credits with a type-

writer,” Terri said. “The idea is to use the old stories in 

these old formats very deliberately in conversation with 

each other.” 

For other films that are portraits of her friends and 

family, she uses Super 8 in the same camera she’s had 

since grad school. A Super 8 camera is a small film camera 

designed for home use that has a cartridge system for the 

film instead of a system one has to thread in the dark. 

“I use my Super 8 camera to make films ... that might be 

nostalgic because often it’s about something that’s disap-

pearing from the world,” Terri said. “So they’re like ele-

gies for friends who are passing or family who are passing 

or who I know are passing ... it’s almost religious to me.” 

As Terri explained, I saw her understand and use film 

as both history and present choice. I can’t imagine my 
studies without her or her work without film. 

The next day I talked to Fritz Swanson, a lecturer in 

the English department who runs Wolverine Press; he 

also has a background in film photography. I went into our 

conversation with the practical details from Terri, look-

ing for someone to explain more about how some of these 

concepts like nostalgia or history relate to the visual sig-

natures we discussed. I now understood the importance of 

the practice and the choices of artists looking to say some-

thing, but I was still unclear on what we’re all saying. 

Fritz framed the issue philosophically with a discus-

sion of the author Virginia Woolf and her printing press.

 “She hates being edited by 

men, on some level, she prob-

ably hates being edited by upper-

middle class men, when she’s 

clearly better than them,” Fritz 

said. “And so she just goes out 

and buys the press and that’s the 

thing. For her, owning a press 

and being able to start her own 

publishing company was a pre-

requisite for really fulfilling her 

own ambitions as a writer.” 

So the choice then is who — 

meaning what technology — an 

artist wants to be their co-author. 

And the implication of having the 

choice is that you own some kind 

of means of production. 

Isn’t this true of all technol-

ogy, any medium? 

“Analog mediums are so in-

teresting, because they resist in-

trusion from the author in inter-

esting and unpredictable ways,” 

Fritz said. 

Digital technologies are a co-

author designed to help in their 

own way and be easy and ap-

pealing to a mass market. Ana-

log technologies are transparent 

and selectable and can hurt more 

than they help — they are not de-

signed to be a helping hand, but a 

tool in a kit. Nothing is stopping 

you from using the wrong stock. 

In describing how sensitive 

to light a certain film emulsion 

is, filmmakers use the adjec-

tives “fast” and “slow.” You can 

see in the finished product that 

the grain on a fast stock, for low 

light, literally moves around 

faster. If you look for it, you’ll 

see it change throughout a mov-

ie depending on if the location 

is brightly or dimly lit. When I 

notice it, a film becomes much 

more dimensional. I can actually 

observe it like one would a sculp-

ture and walk behind, or maybe inside, the camera. 

I don’t know if I’m nostalgic or determined to master 

the signature of film. Maybe both. But after exploring 

more, I think those are both good words holding the place 

of another concept. The completely random, consequen-

tial movement of film grain that is chosen by an artist is 

the aesthetic that makes each of us feel our specific way 

about images shot on film. The choice of a type of move-

ment to make a type of image, but what each particle 

does to produce that whole is up to chance. Grain. It’s a 

somewhat ineffable aesthetic that, after examination, says 

I chose this and I know how and why to use this and my 

means of production worked on this WITH me. And that is 

what looked yellow and inviting and alive to me all those 

years ago.

On analog 
technology

P

eople say you don’t know what 
you’ve got until it’s gone. However, 
when it comes to technology, the 

opposite holds true: You don’t know what 
you’ve got until you’re stuck with it.

Over the course of the pandemic, technol-

ogy has creeped further into our lives, educa-
tion being no exception. All of my classes this 
semester have been conducted online, as have 
my club meetings and social events. Practical-
ly every interaction I have with the University 
of Michigan happens through a webcam.

However, there is one new technology that 

has seen particularly rapid adoption since the 
beginning of the pandemic: exam proctoring 
software.
T

here are a number of companies 
competing in the remote proc-
toring space, including ProctorU, 

Respondus, ExamSoft, HonorLock and Proc-
torio.

ProctorU, for example, offers four levels of 

online proctoring: record, record+, review+ 
and live+. The most basic service available is 
“record,” which offers identity verification 
and end-to-end recordings of the students’ 
camera and screen. During the exam, the ar-
tificial intelligence records instances of pos-
sible suspicious behavior — anything from 
eye movement to background noise. The ser-
vice then produces a report including flagged 
events that may require further review by an 
instructor.

In comparison, “live+” offers more deter-

rence features designed for high-stakes ex-
ams. Along with monitoring exam-takers via 
artificial intelligence, this service includes a 
proctor who supervises students and inter-
venes when they suspect cheating.

With the breakneck transition to virtual 

learning, there has been a documented in-
crease in cheating, and exam proctoring ser-
vices have stepped in to address this issue. 
In an email to me, Scott McFarland, CEO of 
ProctorU, touted the advantages of software 
solutions to deter academic dishonesty.

“Changes in assessment design can miti-

gate some risks of misconduct,” wrote Mc-
Farland. “But so long as there are remote tests 
that require demonstrated knowledge in the 
form of a test, proctoring will be necessary. As 
of now, the only alternative to remote proctor-
ing is not proctoring, which increases the risk 
of academic misconduct.”
H

owever, all of this increased busi-
ness for remote proctoring has 
coincided with a backlash over 

privacy and accessibility concerns.

Without the backing of their schools, some 

students have taken matters into their own 
hands. Daniel Farzannekou, a student at the 
University of California, Los Angeles, was fea-
tured in The New York Times for his act of 
resistance against the Respondus proctoring 
software. Before the exam could begin, Far-
zannekou replied to directions to scan his face, 
room and ID by holding a profane slip of paper 
up to his webcam and uninstalling the soft-
ware. He called the software “dystopian,” com-
paring his peers’ numbness to its dangers to the 
placating tactics of authoritarian regimes.

When I reached out to Respondus via email 

to comment on criticisms of this kind, they ac-
tually addressed the issue of privacy head-on 
and sent a list of industry-standard protections.

“With online proctoring, students often 

have the misconception that Respondus views 
and uses the webcam videos for its own pur-
poses,” wrote Jodi Feeney, Vice President of 
Operations at Respondus. “The data is owned 
and controlled by the university. Respondus 
doesn’t have human proctors reviewing the 
videos; the proctoring is done by an automated 
system.”

According to Sowers, Respondus also does 

not watch students while they take exams, 
sell or share data with third parties or access 
files on students’ computers. Sowers wrote 
that the software “exceeds the requirements” 
outlined in data protection legislation such as 
FERPA, GDPR, CCPA and frameworks like 
Privacy Shield and SOC 2 certification.

Nevertheless, the use of exam software 

has still resulted in legal controversies over 
privacy. When the Faculty Association of the 
University of Santa Barbara expressed its 
concerns and advocated a policy of refusal 
towards ProctorU in a letter to the Chancel-
lor, ProctorU’s legal counsel levelled spurious 
allegations of trademark infringement, copy-
right infringement and defamation.

Finally, artificial intelligence implemented 

in these services tends to perpetuate discrimi-
nation. The behavior of students suffering 
from chronic illnesses, anxiety or other condi-
tions are singled out by the algorithm. The fa-
cial recognition technology also discriminates 
against people of color. The fact that facial 
recognition systematically fails to recognize 
non-white faces is well-documented, so it 
should not come as a surprise that this phe-
nomenon is being reproduced in the sphere of 
remote assessment.

When I asked if there has been criticism of 

their services, none of the software providers 
I reached out to for this story addressed dis-
crimination or algorithmic bias in their email 
responses.
T

hough this national conversation 
has been brewing since the begin-
ning of the pandemic, it was only 

after a few of my friends finished the Law 
School Admission Test in the first week of Oc-
tober that I began to take notice of the invasive 
nature of proctoring software. Hearing about 
their experiences — such as showing proctors 
their rooms or allowing proctors to control 
their laptop’s function — was pretty unsettling, 
and I was curious to know whether automated 
remote proctoring had penetrated into regular 
college courses as well.

The college of Literature, Science and the 

Arts has staked out a clear position on remote 
proctoring technologies. On the LSA Technol-
ogy Services website, the college specifically 
recommends against the Respondus Lock-
down Browser, which prevents students from 
navigating away from a webpage, and other 
third party services. They enjoin faculty to 
“Avoid the Temptation for Invasive Technol-
ogy Solutions to Address Issues of Academic 
Integrity.”

And indeed, the LSA students that I spoke 

with had not experienced remote proctoring 
software in their college courses.

When I spoke over the phone with LSA se-

nior Teresa Clark, she indicated her gratitude 
for the way professors were handling assess-
ments.

“To accommodate people’s schedules, pro-

fessors will give you the entire day to complete 
the exam,” Stark said. “They’ll release it at the 
beginning of the day and give you the entire 
day to work on it so they have been definitely 

less stressful and less high stakes than in-per-
son exams.”

Stark also took the LSAT earlier this month, 

and the easygoing nature of her professors 
stood in sharp contrast to the ProctorU em-
ployee who kept an eye on her during the LSAT.

“You have to record your entire room,” Stark 

said with a laugh. “Which did cause some con-
fusion because my room was pretty messy and 
they apparently prefer that they don’t see any-
thing in the video.”

When I asked Stark how she would have re-

acted if she had been accused of cheating, she 
explained that the business about her cluttered 
room might have weighed against her.

“My room had like a bunch of random stuff 

in it,” Stark continued. “And I would have found 
it difficult to prove that I didn’t have some ex-
tra material around me.”

Outside of LSA, some colleges have em-

ployed different methods to deter cheating. 
During our phone conversation, Business and 
Engineering junior Vikas Chanduri explained 
how exams work in those two colleges. 

“In the entire engineering department, the 

engineering honor code works in a way where, 
even when we have in-person exams, there 
actually isn’t a proctor in the room,” Chanduri 
said. Instead, in pre-pandemic times, the honor 
code allowed engineering students to walk into 
an auditorium and take exams surrounded only 
by other students, with professors or Graduate 
Student Instructors waiting outside the exam 
room in case anyone had any questions.

The College of Engineering simply places 

trust in its students — what a concept! That 
attitude, however, differs quite a bit from the 
Machiavellian world of the Ross School of 
Business. 

“In all my (pre-COVID) Ross classes there 

were always (GSIs) walking around and my 
professors were at the front of the classroom 
for questions,” Chanduri explained. “So I guess 
in a way that has been transferred into a virtual 
environment, exactly the same way that it was 
before.”

Chanduri then talked about his experience 

using the Respondus Lockdown Browser dur-
ing one of his Business School classes last se-
mester.

“It was kinda weird at first having the cam-

era on the whole time,” Chanduri explained. 
“But I guess it’s the same idea as if you had a 
proctor watching everyone in an exam room … 
so I didn’t think it was that big of a deal.”
I

n my view, however, the problem with 
exam proctoring technologies is that 
they are not really helping us to adapt. 

Rather, they are providing a vulnerable techno-
logical crutch we will be stuck with long after 
the pandemic ends.

Consider the fact that most of these services 

require students to have access to a computer 
and a good wireless connection. In Michigan, 
the rift between those who have internet con-
nectivity and those who do not, known as the 
“digital divide,” poses a huge challenge for on-
line education. Research conducted by The 
Education Trust shows that the percent of stu-
dents without digital access in some counties 
in Michigan is around 30-40%, and a recent 
report from The Brookings Institution stated 
that 70 out of 83 Michigan counties have in-
ternet connectivity rates below the national 
average.

To the extent that adaptation is happen-

ing, it is actually students and faculty adapting 
to technology, not the other way around. For 
students to even be able to take exams, they 
have to download software or Chrome exten-
sions, subject themselves to invasive security 
procedures and allow artificial intelligence to 
gather extensive data on their behavior. I sup-
pose that for many of us who have become 
accustomed to pervasive online surveillance, 
this does not seem like too much to ask.

Here is the thing about erecting digital 

fences around university exams: Clever com-
puter science majors will always find ways to 
hop over them. Some of them have even posted 
lists of possible circumvention methods online 
for everyone to see. The Virtual Machine, for 
instance, lets people run computer programs 
on software embedded within their physical 
computers. Even something as simple as Post-
it Notes on one’s screen can work around the 
most basic software solutions.

The result will not be the ultimate victory 

of proctoring technologies, but an intermi-
nable arms race between software providers 
and cheaters. As the methods of security and 
prevention advance, so too will methods of 
circumvention. We might even see a revolving 
door between the makers of remote proctoring 
software and a growing suite of circumvention 
services.

Ultimately, educational institutions need 

to understand that any technological “solu-
tion” comes with its own host of problems. 
There are not side effects or unintended con-
sequences; they are latent in the design of the 
technology itself. That is why many professors 
have turned to alternative methods of exami-
nation that require students to demonstrate 
their thought process and engagement with 
class material: some examples include ditching 
multiple choice exams for in-class essays, or 
having students present material in a presenta-
tion or project.

Remote proctoring technologies have 

some utility, especially when professors need 
to deliver high-stakes exams to hundreds of 
students. But where a relationship of trust 
already exists between student and teacher, 
this is what should be relied upon rather than 
technology.

Perhaps we should also turn our attention 

to the education system in which an over-
whelming number of students believe they 
must cheat to get ahead. If only indirectly, 
proctoring software companies benefit from 
institutions that believe themselves to be full 
of tricksters and thieves. Therefore, they do 
not really want to solve the problem of aca-
demic dishonesty, even if such a thing could 
be done. What really matters is whether uni-
versities suspect their students of cheating 
and can think of no better way to stop them.
D

espite his reputation for advising 
deceit, Machiavelli himself recog-
nized that the ways of treachery 

could win a prince, “power, but not glory (im-
perio, ma non gloria).” Deep down, I think we 
all share this intuition that fraud impedes true 
greatness. And, therefore, that aspiring musi-
cians, athletes and artists should avoid fraud 
as much as aspiring accountants, lawyers and 
engineers.

In the end, no matter how well exam 

proctoring technologies can deter cheating 
through surveillance and fear of punishment, 
they never will be able to convey its real cost; 
that in developing the skill of cheating, one 
neglects the virtue of learning.

The hard truth about 
exam software

BY ALEXANDER SATOLA, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

ILLUSTRATION BY EILEEN KELLY


9,673 miles. 
That’s the distance from Ann 

Arbor to Wagga Wagga, Australia, 
the rural hometown of Charlie 
Pilon. Pilon, now entering his senior 
season on the Michigan men’s golf 
team, found his love for the sport 
at a young age, a passion that would 
eventually take him across an ocean 
to compete against some of the best 
golfers in the world.

“When I was four or five, my dad 

got me a little plastic set of clubs, 
and I would whack plastic balls 
around the house,” Pilon said. “I 
started traveling for events at the 
age of seven or eight, driving five 
hours both ways to Sydney with my 
family.”

Pilon quickly built up a reputation 

as one of the best amateur golfers 
in Australia, ranking third in the 
Australian Boys Ranking and 117th 
in the men’s rankings. He competed 
in multiple events as an amateur 
in Australia and won back-to-back 
16-17 age division titles, becoming 
the first to do so since former world 
number one Jason Day. His success 
garnered interest from various 
universities in the United States, but 
Pilon eventually chose Michigan 
for its strong golf program and 

prestigious academics.

“I moved to Queensland for 

boarding school when I was 14, so I 
was good at being by myself for long 
periods of time,” Pilon said. “The 
transition to America on the other 
side of the world for college wasn’t 
too bad.”

The golf team has always had 

foreign athletes, ranging from 
Australia to Italy. As a freshman, 
Pilon found his niche on the team 
with the help of the athletes around 
him. Now, in his senior year, he 
looks to replicate that leadership.

“The guys we’ve had come in 

as freshmen are a great bunch of 
guys,” Pilon said. “They’ve really 
molded really well with the team.” 

The prominence of golf in the U.S. 

played a big part in Pilon’s decision 
to come to the U.S for college. Since 
joining the Wolverines. He has 
built off the success he experienced 
in Australia, being named to the 
All-Big Ten Tournament Team in 
2019. Pilon has also found more 
opportunities to compete in big 
tournaments 
against 
quality 

competition in the U.S.

“A lot of guys on the tour right 

now came through the college 
system, so it was a great opportunity 
to compete with some of the best 
amateurs in the world and get a 
degree at the same time,” Pilon said. 
“There’s great events all around the 

country all the time. We definitely 
have a handful of great events in 
Australia, but America just has a 
ton of them, so you’ve always got 
something to play.”

With the upcoming season still 

an unknown due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, the team continues 
to prepare while following new 
guidelines. While in team facilities, 
golfers must wear masks, in addition 
to 
participating 
in 
mandatory 

weekly testing. Even with these 
new restrictions, the team practices 
with the intent that they will be 
playing a full season in the spring.

The team aspect of college golf, 

which is a rather individual sport, is 
something that Pilon values highly. 

“Team golf is really cool,” said 

Pilon. “That was one of the things 
that kind of attracted me to play 
college golf. Golf is a bit of a lonely 
sport, but being on a team makes it 
more enjoyable everyday.”

Now, as Pilon looks to the season 

ahead and his career beyond college 
golf, he hopes to follow the path 
of many top collegiate golfers by 
joining the professional tour.

“I’m hoping to stay in the states 

and turn pro to try and make a 
living out of it,” Pilon said. “I’ll go 
back to Australia and train a little 
there. Then I’ll try and go to the 
Asian circuit and onward to either 
America or Europe.”

Charlie Pilon’s journey from 

Australia to Ann Arbor isn’t done yet

Building on his success golfing in Australia, Charlie Pilon took his experience to Ann Arbor for college, citing the 
team culture and U.S. golf opportunities as reasons for making the move to the U.S.

Wednesday, October 21, 2020 — 17

For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team, the COVID-
19 pandemic and everything 
that’s accompanied it from an 
athletic perspective — namely, 
the cancellation of postseason 
tournaments, long periods of 
self-isolation, 
the 
inability 

to practice or workout as a 
team, frequent testing and the 
uncertainty surrounding the 
start of a new season — has 
been inconvenient at best and 
at times, incredibly daunting. 

As Michigan’s sophomore 

forward 
Franz 
Wagner 

summed it up: “It was really 
weird. I didn’t see a lot of 
people. ... Just seeing the three, 
four people every day. I love my 
family, but I think everybody 
agrees, you gotta see somebody 
else. 
It 
was 
definitely 
a 

frustrating transition with the 
season cut short.”

The past few months have 

been unlike any other. It’s 
been different. The next few 
months will be different. The 
only thing that’s certain is 
uncertainty.

“It’s been a lot of unknowns,” 

Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 

Howard said. “It’s been a lot 
of learning throughout the 
process, learning what the 
‘new’ is gonna look like. At the 
end of the day, you still try to 
keep forging ahead.”

The unprecedented nature 

of the pandemic has been a 
common refrain. It’s forced 
all facets of society to change, 
pause and in some cases stop 
altogether — college athletics 
being one of them. 

But, 
as 
much 
as 
the 

pandemic has taken away from 
sports, and specifically from 
college basketball programs 
like Michigan, the Wolverines 
have also found a silver lining 
through it all. 

“I think it’s been a time of 

reflection and an opportunity 
for a reset,” assistant coach 
Saddi 
Washington 
said. 
“I 

say that both personally and 
professionally because I think 
what it’s allowed everybody to 
do is realign their priorities 
and perspective in life based 
on what we’ve had to go 
through and what we’ve had 
to go without that we thought 
was important. We’ve learned 

to be much more efficient 
with our time. I think it’s also 
been an opportunity to reset 
some things in life or in our 
program.”

From a basketball standpoint, 

it was difficult at first for 
some players to sharpen their 
game during quarantine. The 
resources and situation of a 
player’s hometown determined 
the extent to which they could 
play. Senior walk-on guard 
Rico Ozuna-Harrison had to 
revert to running and boxing 
in order to stay in shape since 
his native city, Detroit, closed 
all outdoor parks and removed 
the basketball rims from the 
courts. 
Others, 
like 
senior 

guard Eli Brooks, at least had 
access to a friend’s gym and 
could shoot around. 

According to Washington, 

though, 
the 
imperfect 

conditions may have been a 
blessing in disguise. 

“I think also that once 

something is taken away or 
paused for a while, that’s 
when you get this new love for 
the game again,” he said. “It 
challenged our guys to really 
re-evaluate, you know, ‘How 
much do I really love this game? 

Because right now, I can’t even 
get in the gym, so I gotta find 
a park outside somewhere, or I 
have to do ball-handling, push-
ups and sit-ups and a lot of stuff 
at home.’

“The message to our guys, 

though, was, ‘Hard work is 
never wasted work.’ It’s still on 
us to remain diligent in terms 
of working out and staying 
ready. … Those are all things 
we can control.”

When many of the players 

returned to campus in June, 
they still had to abide by 
Michigan 
state 
regulations 

limiting the size of group 
activities. This meant working 
out 
in 
small 
groups 
and 

focusing on their conditioning 
and skill development. 

“That’s at the core of who we 

are, we’re a skill-developing 
program and we always have 
been,” Washington said. “It 
allowed us to really focus in 
and hone in on specific parts 
of guys’ games and really grow 
those areas.” 

Added 
Brooks: 
“We’re 

pushing 
harder 
than 
we 

ever had before, like with 
conditioning and that aspect of 
getting people in shape quicker. 

It’s been good to be able to slow 
down and do the development 
stage instead of rushing into 
plays and stuff — being able to 
really see the bigger picture.”

As much as the Wolverines 

are 
looking 
forward 
to 

organized, team-wide practices 
commencing this week, the 
unique 
and 
individualized 

workouts had their advantages. 

“There’s gonna be a lot more 

five on five (with practice 
starting),” 
senior 
forward 

Isaiah 
Livers 
said. 
“Other 

than that, I feel like a lot of 
guys, 
especially 
the 
young 

ones, are more locked in than I 
thought they were. … I feel like 
everybody’s adjusting very well 
and I hope it trends that way.”

As Washington suggested, 

quarantine also gave the team 
a chance to focus on their well-
being off the court as well. Amid 
the pandemic and the ongoing 
occurrences of racial injustice, 
Howard and the coaching staff 
encouraged their players to 
speak their minds during team 
meetings. As a result, Michigan 
established its culture and 
incorporated 
new 
additions 

earlier than ever before — even 
if it was over Zoom. 

“This summer opened up 

some space for us to really have 
some 
honest 
conversations 

about what’s really going on in 
the world that normally, within 
our athletic bubbles, may go off 
of our radar,” Washington said. 
“Our team really dialed into 
the issues, took it to heart and 
allowed it to bring us closer 
together. Through adversity 
you really get to see who are 
the people in your corner and 
I feel like our guys understand 
that at a higher level now.”

The events of the last few 

months 
have 
upended 
our 

sense of normalcy as a nation. 
For Michigan’s players and 
coaches, this meant an abrupt 
ending to last season and time 
spent away from the game they 
love. 

But these hard times may not 

have been for nothing. 

“I’m just excited, and I think 

our guys are just excited to 
play again,” Washington said. 
“Whatever it’s gonna look like, 
it will look like, but to have 
that abrupt end to last season 
without any closure really gives 
us a newfound motivation to go 
out there and take nothing for 
granted.”

Wolverines finding silver lining in lengthy offseason

Remember the yellow pom-

poms that they used to give 
away at home football games?

The things that were part of 

so many unforgettable nights 
at the Big House?

When 
the 
athletic 

department shifted its focus to 
zero-waste game days back in 
2017, the pom-poms — which 
produced a lot of waste — were 
placed on the chopping block 
in favor of rally towels.

“There was a little bit of 

pushback early on in zero 
waste, because we weren’t 
gonna 
offer 
pom 
poms,” 

associate 
athletic 
director 

in facility operations Paul 
Dunlop said. “So we did rally 
towels instead, because we did 
find that most people would 
take them home, and most 
people do.”

The rally towel has proven to 

be a more environmentally and 
waste-conscious way to spice 
up game days in Ann Arbor. 
Even when the rally towels are 
left in the stadium after games, 
Big House staff picks them 
up. Instead of throwing them 
away, the athletic department 

uses them as rags or shop 
towels in their workshops 
around the department.

The rally towels are just one 

instance of the University’s 
shift toward sustainability as a 
whole over the last few years.

“Waste 
reduction 
and 

recycling 
have 
almost 

become part of our everyday 
operations,” 
Dunlop 
said. 

“Back in (2013) it was kinda 
newer back then, where we did 
not necessarily have recycling 
in every building. But walk 
through our buildings today 
there’s 
recycling 
in 
every 

corridor, a lot have regular 
compost collection. It’s like 
night and day.”

Waste 
reduction 
doesn’t 

only 
mean 
physical 
waste 

though. It’s also about energy 
conservation and the reduction 
of the University’s carbon 
footprint, which has been a 
big priority of the athletic 
department of late.

They have started to shift 

their lighting schedules to 
be as tight as possible, so as 
to not burn any unnecessary 
electricity. 

Accoring 
to 
a 
Freedom 

of Information Act request 
filed by the The Daily, the 
University 
spent 
$50,333 

powering the Big House in the 
month of April, and $31,959 as 
well as $25,056 in the months 
May and June respectively.

“(We 
really 
focus) 
that 

we 
are 
not 
wasting 
any 

unnecessary utilities,” Dunlop 
said. “We have a lot of big 
buildings like the Big House, 
and Crisler, and Yost. And, 
in order to keep those places 
running, we need a lot of 
electricity. So it’s a big focus 
for multiple reasons.”

In 
this 
coming 
football 

season, 
composting 
will 

be off the table for a wide 
variety of reasons, one of 
which is obvious — no fans. 
The University is unsure of 
the nature of their contract 
with the janitorial company 
that runs gameday operations 
regarding waste and cleanup 
— one of the many trade-offs 
the COVID-affected football 
season has brought with it.

It’s clear though, even if true 

zero-waste game days have yet 
to be achieved, that the athletic 
department is moving with 
the times and making strides 
towards energy conservation 
and waste management.

The Maize and Blue has got 

a bit more of a green tint than 
it used to.

Through zero waste initiatives, 

Michigan is improving its sustainability

Since 2017, the grass has been greener for the University of Michigan athletic department because of its zero-
waste policy.

Offense is up around college football. 

Can Michigan adapt?

Of 29 FBS games played last 

week, 21 had 50 or more total 
points scored. The previous week, 
that number was 20 out of 32. Even 
teams known for defense have 
struggled to contain the scoring 
— just look at Pitt’s 31-30 loss to 
Boston College or Alabama’s 63-48 
shootout with Mississippi.

Whether 
it’s 
a 
pandemic-

induced blip on the radar or a 
further transformation of college 
football into a game dominated by 
offense, there’s no doubt offense 
is up this year across the board. 
According to MLive, 55% of teams 
that have played at least one game 
are averaging 30 points or more per 
game, up from 45% in 2019.

If that trend carries over 

to the Big Ten, it would be a 
transformation 
in 
a 
league 

somewhat infamous for its low-
scoring games.

Michigan players and coaches 

have their own theories on why 
this is and how to adapt to the new 
trend. Defensive line coach Shaun 
Nua thinks that the lack of spring 
ball and a fall camp without pads 
affected defense more than offense 
because defense requires more 
cohesion. But that doesn’t explain 
everything.

“It was harder to build a team 

thing and defense is all team,” 
Nua said Wednesday. “If you don’t 
have all 11 guys bought in, that’s 
hard to do. It’s hard to play sound, 
aggressive defense if you don’t have 
all 11 guys bought into it. … (But) we 
can’t always blame it on, oh they 
missed spring ball or fall camp, 
because the offense is doing good. 
So hopefully we can figure it out.”

Even with teams passing more 

frequently and utilizing up-tempo 
no-huddle offenses, Nua believes 
the key to his unit’s performance 
still lies in stopping the run. An 
offense can only go so fast, Nua 
said, if its run game isn’t working.

According to senior defensive 

end Kwity Paye, Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh reads the team 
statistics before practice. One 
of those stats is that the team 
that scores first has the definite 
advantage in the game. For a 
defensive player like Paye, that’s 
a matter of execution: Stop the 
opposing offense and hope your 
own guys can get points on the 
board.

For the offense, this scoring 

trend means a renewed focus on 
explosive plays. Last year, the 
Wolverines saw the importance 
of big plays from both sides; Penn 
State’s execution of such plays 
helped lift it to a win against 
Michigan, while a failure to finish 
drives against Alabama proved 
to be the offense’s undoing in the 
Citrus Bowl.

“As an offense, we know what 

we need to do to be able to score 
more points, move the ball the 
way we want to and beat the 
teams that are gonna be on our 
schedule and one of those things 
is being more explosive,” running 
backs coach Jay Harbaugh said 
on Oct. 7. “ ... Playcalling is harder 
when you’re just inching down the 
field, that’s where I think myself 
and (offensive line coach Ed) 
Warinner and (tight ends coach 
Sherrone) Moore collectively, all 
of us plus (quarterbacks coach 
Ben) McDaniels, we buy into the 
vision of the offense, we love what 
(offensive coordinator Josh) Gattis 

puts on the game plan for us, we 
love the way he sees the game. We 
gotta create more explosive plays 
as a unit to be able to take some of 
that pressure off of him.”

Jay Harbaugh also spoke to 

a philosophical shift in teams’ 
defensive approaches. Back when 
college football was predicated 
on the run, teams often stuffed 
the tackle box with eight linemen. 
That’s 
no 
longer 
a 
realistic 

approach in most situations given 
the growing threat of the pass. 
Now, with defenses forced to cover 
more of the field, the likelihood of a 
conversion goes up.

That’s the theory behind the 

spread offense, which first came 
into use in college football in the 
early 2000s. Now, though, more 
and more teams are using some 

variation of the spread — including 
Minnesota, the opponent the 
Wolverines will face in just over a 
week.

“It’s the spread offense, run 

principles, spread offense, RPOs,” 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
said Sept. 30. “That’s what we 
anticipate getting.”

The Big Ten has in general 

been slow to adapt to the growing 
offensive trend in college football. 
But maybe a long layoff for the 
league this year will help. Now, 
its teams have seen the rising 
offensive tide and with it, have 
their own chance to adapt.

Harbaugh indicates Gemon Green likely 

to start at cornerback

Ever since Ambry Thomas 

announced he would opt out 
of the season back in August, 
uncertainty at cornerback has 
loomed 
over 
the 
Michigan 

defense.

Other than Vincent Gray, who 

appeared in every game last 
season, the Wolverines don’t 
have a single returning corner 
with 
substantial 
experience. 

The names floated as possible 
starters 
opposite 
him 
have 

ranged from freshman Andre 
Seldon to sophomore safety 
Daxton Hill — “Maybe the most 
talented player on the team,” 
according to Jim Harbaugh 
on WTKA’s Inside Michigan 
Football, but one with no viable 
replacement at safety.

On Monday, Harbaugh and 

linebacker Josh Ross finally 
hinted at the real answer: junior 
Gemon Green.

“Gemon 
Green’s 
doing 
a 

very good job,” Harbaugh said 
in a Zoom press conference 
when asked about the second 
cornerback 
spot, 
before 

mentioning 
Sammy 
Faustin, 

D.J. Turner and Jalen Perry.
In Harbaugh’s world, that’s
as concrete of a depth chart
proclamation as exists (a few
minutes earlier, he demurred
when asked whether surefire
starter Joe Milton will indeed
be Michigan’s QB1).

Later in the afternoon, Ross 

seemed to agree.

“Coming into this year, we 

had a lot of questions about who 
our second guy was going to be, 
especially with Ambry leaving,” 
Ross said. “Brad Hawkins, Dax 
(Hill), Vince (Gray), Gemon 
Green, too. Those guys have 
been playing really, really well.”

Hawkins, 
Hill 
and 
Gray 

have been presumed secondary 
starters since January. If Green 
is the fourth name in that group, 
it’s fair to presume Michigan’s 

biggest defensive question mark 
has found its answer.

That’s not to say the questions 

end there — Green has seen 
action on defense just once, last 
year against Notre Dame. For 
most of his time in Ann Arbor, 
his duties have rotated between 
the scout team and occasional 
appearances on special teams.

Still, if he starts against 

Minnesota 
on 
Saturday, 
it 

indicates an offseason of rapid 
improvement. Earlier this fall, 
Turner and Perry were the 

hottest names set to replace 
Thomas. Green starting would 
mean he’s impressed sufficiently 
to pass them.

There are other uncertainties 

in Michigan’s defensive depth 
chart, of course — chiefly at 
defensive tackle and VIPER. 
But the Wolverines’ cornerback 
situation has always stood out 
as unique. Gone is Thomas, an 
NFL talent who was among the 
Big Ten’s best corners last year. 
So too is Lavert Hill, a two-time 
first-team All-Big Ten selection 
in 2018 and 2019.

Between 
them, 
Michigan 

boasted one of the country’s 
most formidable secondaries 
a year ago, finishing 10th in 
passing 
yards 
allowed 
and 

providing cover for an often-
porous rush defense. This year, 
the Wolverines face an uphill 
battle to have the same luxury.

Regardless of who starts 

across from him, the path 
to getting there starts with 
Gray. Arriving as a relatively 
unheralded three-star in 2018, 
Gray 
quickly 
became 
key 

secondary depth, seeing time 
in nickel packages and starting 
against Illinois when Hill was 
out injured.

“One guy that’s standing out 

to me, it’s a big year ahead of him 
… is Vince Gray,” Ross said. “He’s 
been doing everything the right 
way. He’s covering so well.”

On Saturday, that offseason 

development will be put to the 
test against Minnesota’s Rashod 
Bateman. A year ago, Bateman 
led the conference with 20.3 
yards per reception, finishing 
with 1219 receiving yards and 
11 touchdowns on the season. 
It’s the type of matchup that 
could have seen Thomas shadow 
him around the field had he 
returned.

Instead, the burden will lie 

on Gray and, at times, whoever 
lines up opposite him. As of 
Monday, that seems most likely 
to be Green.

Gemon Green is likely to fill the hole at Michigan’s second cornerback 
spot.

Welcome to the strangest game

week of your life

A

round 2:15 p.m. on 
Sunday, an email 
from a Purdue 
spokesman 

landed in my inbox with the 
subject line, “Jeff Brohm Tests 
Presumed Positive for CoVid-
19.”

Welcome to game week in 

the Big Ten.

Until now, it’s been easy 

to feel a little removed from 
things 
as 

the rest of 
the country 
has 
played 

college 
football. Not 
anymore.

We 

watched 
Georgia and 
Alabama on 
Saturday, 
but 
at

this point, Tuscaloosa and 
Ann Arbor feel like they’re 
in separate countries. That 
sentiment 
is 
even 
more 

pertinent when the camera 
cuts to the stands at Bryant-
Denny Stadium and Crimson 
Tide fans are lined up in 
columns, as if the coronavirus 
doesn’t 
spread 
vertically, 

with their masks in several 
variations of on. 

Football 
has 
been 
a 

sideshow to distract as we’ve 
worried 
about 
the 
virus 

here on campus, where even 
the 
administration 
at 
the 

University 
has 
started 
to 

publicly admit there might 
be a problem as quarantine 
housing hits 50 percent and 
keeps 
climbing 
and 
Mary 

Markley 
Hall 
goes 
into 

pseudo-quarantine 
for 
two 

weeks.

The University said this 

week that an announcement 
on the format of the winter 
semester would come by Nov. 
1. It’s not particularly easy to
argue that the fall has been 
a 
success, 
unless 
they’re 

only looking at the death toll 
(thankfully, zero) or their own 
bottom line. 

Now, we’re supposed to 

worry about … how Joe Milton 
plays at quarterback? 

Purdue’s 
head 
coach 
is 

likely positive for COVID-
19. Hopefully he recovers in
full. Based on what we’ve
seen in the conferences that
are already deep into their
seasons, though, we can glean
two things:

Brohm won’t be the last 

positive case.

This season is a farce.
In the AAC, Houston has 

had five games postponed 
due to COVID-19. In the SEC, 
Florida coach Dan Mullen 
called for a crowd of 90,000 
at The Swamp after his team 
lost a game, refused to walk 
it back, then tested positive 
for the virus all in the span 
of a week. In the Pac-12, 
California state regulations 
didn’t permit teams to hold 
an actual practice ahead of 
the conference’s Nov. 7 start 
date, then things got changed 
around so they could (though 
Stanford must go to a local 
high school). Two of the 
current AP Top 10, Ohio State 
and Penn State, have yet to 
play a game. 

Exactly 
how 
anyone 
is 

supposed to rank teams in this 
environment is an impossible 
question to answer. So is 
exactly why anyone should 
care who makes the Playoff or 
wins the national title.

Let me expand on that a 

little. I will watch, report 
on and write in detail about 
Michigan 
football 
this 

season. The Daily will have 
as many writers at as many 
games as regulations allow 
for. It’s fantastic to have 
college football back, and the 
distraction it provides from 
everything is wonderful. But 
this feels weird. The entire 

season 
is 
an 
exercise 
in 

cognitive dissonance.

Let’s be real. Has there 

ever been a Michigan football 
game that feels less important 
than this one?

It seems wrong that football 

players can get tested daily 
when regular students have 
trouble getting asymptomatic 
testing. It doesn’t sit right 
that, beyond a brief moment 
in 
August, 
the 
entire 

conversation around football 
coming back failed to include 
the idea that players should 
be paid for what is an obvious 
exchange of service to make 
universities money — and one 
in which their health is even 
more at risk than usual. It 
is bizarre that we’re having 
a 
season 
and 
acting 
like 

everything is OK when games 
are getting postponed every 
week because players have 
caught a pandemic disease. 

Following 
the 
daily 

machinations of a season — 
who’s hurt, who’s healthy, 
how does Michigan match up 
against its opponent this week 
— in this environment feels 
like clinging onto a routine 
when the world is burning. 
It’s hard to blame anyone for 
trying to have games given the 
economic circumstances and 
the general public being OK 
with — even actively wanting 
— football. 

I’m not sure that I can 

blame anyone or be upset, 
given that games happening 
are an objectively good thing 
for me, my career aspirations 
and The Michigan Daily at 
large. 

That doesn’t change how 

weird this feels.

Welcome to game week. 

Stay safe.

Stay-at-home order won’t affect 

Michigan athletics

On 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 

Washtenaw 
County 
issued 

a stay-at-home order for all 
Michigan 
undergraduate 

students. However, the order 
will 
not 
affect 
Michigan 

athletics, 
per 
the 
health 

department press release.

According 
to 
an 
email 

from a University spokesman 
on Oct. 16, there have been 
104 total positive cases from 
11,889 tests administered to 
Michigan 
student-athletes, 

coaches and staff since teams 
began returning to campus in 
June.

Since Sept. 30, the football 

team has been tested daily 
with antigen tests provided 
by the Big Ten. Michigan 

coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 

Monday that no players are 
currently positive for COVID-
19. Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck
told Minnesota reporters at 
the same time that he would 
not share the number of 
players on his team that were 
out with the virus.

Big Ten protocols dictate 

that 
games 
and 
practices 

will be cancelled if 7.5% of 
personnel test positive within 
a seven-day period. Over 10% 
of scheduled college football 
games played this season have 
been cancelled, though the Big 
Ten’s testing protcols are the 
most stringent in the country.

While 
all 
non-revenue 

fall NCAA sports have been 
postponed 
to 
the 
spring, 

Michigan’s 
football 
season 

is scheduled to begin on 
Saturday at Minnesota. The 

Wolverines’ first home game 
is scheduled for 12 p.m. on 
Oct. 
31 
against 
Michigan 

State. No Big Ten games are 
being played with fans in 
attendance, but parents will 
be permitted to attend. It is 
unclear whether that will 
change with the most recent 
order.

According 
to 
Michigan 

coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
the 

Wolverines do not currently 
have any positive COVID-
19 cases. The University as a 
whole reported 301 positive 
cases last week, though that 
figure only includes testing 
conducted 
by 
University 

Health 
Services. 
66% 
of 

positive cases in Washtenaw 
County over the last two 
weeks have been from 18-22 
year olds, implying a high 
caseload from the University.
