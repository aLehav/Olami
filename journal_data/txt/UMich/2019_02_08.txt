Meredith 
Clark, 
assistant 
professor of media studies at the 
University of Virginia, spoke to 
about 30 students and faculty in 
North Quad on Thursday afternoon 
as part of the Communication 
and 
Media 
Speaker 
Series, 
hosted 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan Communication Studies 
department.
In her talk, titled “Black Women 
Tried to Tell Y’all,” Clark discussed 
participation and theorization in 
online spaces and the impacts of 
longstanding journalism models 

on communities of color. Clark said 
her goal is to change the journalism 
industry to better represent people 
of color.
“Ultimately, my goal is to develop 
research applications for actual 
journalists to practice,” Clark said. 
“I am interested in disrupting the 
models of journalism we have used 
for so long that have continued to 
shut people of color out of news 
narratives.”
Clark is a former journalist 
whose research focuses on the 
intersections of race, media and 
power. Her dissertation on “Black 
Twitter” landed her on The Root 
100, the news website’s list of the 

most prominent African Americans 
in the country, in 2015. Clark also 
contributes to Poynter’s diversity 
column and has had research 
published in academic journals.
Clark said she grounds her 
work in Black feminist thought, a 
ground-theory framework focused 
on ideas produced by Black women 
and a collection of experiences. She 
discussed the key features of this 
thought framework and its social 
justice roots.
She said she was inspired to start 
her research after reading a Slate 
article titled “How Black People 
Use Twitter.” Clark said she was 
specifically interested in how Black-

lived experiences are portrayed.
“As a copy editor — they used to 
have copy editors working at news 
outlets — you are trained to come up 
with headlines: phrases that catch 
peoples’ attention, that tell them 
concisely what the story is about,” 
Clark said. “So, when I pull up this 
story on Slate magazine, frankly 
I was alarmed. Someone was 
making such broad generalizations 
about what Blacks are doing on the 
internet.”
A gerrymandering lawsuit filed 
by the League of Women Voters 
went to trial U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of Michigan on 
Tuesday after a settlement offered 
by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson 
was rejected. Benson’s settlement 
offer was a proposal to declare 11 of 
Michigan’s 110 state House districts 
unconstitutional and called for 
them to be redrawn by an unbiased 
redistricting 
committee 
within 
legislature. One of those districts, 
the 55th, includes part of Ann Arbor 
and is currently represented by Rep. 
Rebekah Warren, D-Ann Arbor.
The 
LWV, 
a 
non-partisan 
organization, 
as 
well 
as 
11 
Democratic voters filed a lawsuit 
back in December 2017 against 
the current districting lines of 
Michigan, which were previously 
drawn under Governor Rick Snyder 
in 2011. They claimed the lines are 
restricting Democratic voters to 
select districts while spreading out 
Republican voters throughout the 
state, giving them more influence 
over how districts vote.

Former Mich. 
rep dies at 92

John Dingell, longest-serving congressman 
in US history, passed away Thursday

For the month of February, the 
University of Michigan, partnered 
with Mcity, will be hosting various 
online 
“teach-outs” 
regarding 
research 
on 
self-driving 
cars 
and the implementation of such 
technology 
in 
contemporary 
society.
Teach-outs are academic tools 
developed at the University that 
aim to bridge the gap between 
researchers and academics and 
the broader public, allowing both 
groups to engage in meaningful 
conversation. The teach-out series 
was launched by the Office of 
Academic Innovation in March 
2017, modeled after the teach-in 
strategy that also began at the 
University and was employed 
during the civil rights movement. 
Ranging in all subjects these teach-
out courses can be accessed by 
anyone who is interested, at no cost.
Mcity, a mock city located on 
Michigan’s North Campus, was 
built in order to test wirelessly 
connected and driverless vehicles.

Felony policy 
spurs criticism

New protocol requires staff to disclose 
charges and convinctions, sparks debate

The University of Michigan 
enacted a new policy in the 
Standard Practice Guide regarding 
felony disclosure on Monday. The 
policy requires all faculty, staff, 
student employees, volunteers and 
visiting scholars to self-report both 
felony charges and convictions 
within a week of the occurrence.
The policy does not apply to 
those covered by a collective 
bargaining 
agreement 
through 

a union—such as the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization. 
According to the policy, each 
report will be assessed thoroughly 
by Human Resources on a case-
by-case basis based on the nature 
and gravity of the offense, the 
timeliness and accuracy of the 
disclosure, and the relevancy of the 
crime or conviction to the role(s) 
held at the University. Human 
Resources will then determine 
whether disciplinary action will be 
taken.

A former student of School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor 
Stephen 
Shipps 
emailed Melody Racine, the 
interim dean of SMTD in 
October 2017 alleging she had 
been raped by Shipps in the 
1970s. University of Michigan 
policy 
compels 
certain 
employees, such as the dean, to 
immediately report allegations 
of this nature to the Office of 
Institutional Equity. However, 
this former student’s email 
went unanswered for more 
than a year. And 19 days after 
emailing the interim dean, the 
former student emailed Shipps 
himself — another email that 
sat unanswered for more than 
11 months. It is unclear if either 
Racine or Shipps reported this 
former student’s emails to OIE. 
If they did report this email 
to OIE, it is unclear when that 
happened. 
Though the causes of these 
delays remain unclear, they call 
into question multiple aspects 
of 
the 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct policy.
The 
Daily 
communicated 
with Shipps’s former student 
prior to publication of a Dec. 
10 article regarding alleged 
misconduct by Shipps, but her 
allegation — an interaction 
in the late 1970s she believes 
constituted “statutory rape” 
— was not included in that 
article, as she was concerned 
about her privacy. For this same 
reason, the former student has 
requested anonymity. In this 
article, she will be referred to 

as Jane.
In 
communicating 
with 
The Daily, Jane has declined 
to delve into greater detail 
about 
the 
alleged 
assault, 
instead preferring to focus 
on her communications with 
University personnel and the 
responses she did and did not 
receive. She has provided The 
Daily with copies of emails 
between her and the University 
— emails that point both to an 
initial year-long delay and a 
further slow-moving response 
to 
serious 
allegations 
of 
reportedly criminal conduct.
Despite 
the 
University’s 
long-standing policy of refusing 
to comment on “personnel 
matters,” The Daily has also 
been able to confirm that both 
the 
University 
Division 
of 
Public Safety and Security 
and OIE were conducting 
investigations into Shipps 
as of Dec. 7, 2018. At this 
time, the status of these 
investigations is unclear.
Racine declined to 
comment on the specifics of 
this article.
“As is our policy and in 
keeping with my past and 
current duties as a responsible 
employee, I have referred your 
inquiry to our UM’s Public 
Affairs Office,” Racine wrote in 
an email to The Daily.
Shipps did not reply to 
multiple emails requesting his 
comment on this article. His 
lawyer, David Nacht, similarly 
did not reply. 
The 
Daily 
contacted 
Public Affairs for comment 
on 
this 
article. 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
declined 
to 

comment on the specifics of 
this article.
“While we cannot discuss 
specific matters, the university 
takes 
action 
whenever 
it 
receives 
information regarding alleged 
sexual misconduct, which can 
include investigations or other 
actions through UMPD and the 
Office of Institutional Equity,” 
Broekhuizen said.
***

The 
timeline 
of 
The 
Daily’s 
investigation 
into 
Shipps 
provides 
some 
useful 
context 
for 
Jane’s 
communications 
with the University.
On Nov. 2, 2018, 
The Daily contacted 
a potential source for 

information about Shipps. Soon 
after communicating with a 
Daily 
reporter, 
the 
source 
made OIE aware of The Daily’s 
investigation into Shipps. The 
source also made OIE aware 
of the nature of some of the 
allegations 
against 
Shipps 
known to The Daily at the time.

Dr. Meredith Clark, former journalist and current assistant professor at the University of Virginia, gives a talk titled “Black Women Tried to Tell Y’all: 
Race, Representation, and Self-Preservation through Digital Counter-Narratives in North Quad Thursday afternoon.

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily


Michigan 
is 
joining 
a 
coalition of 17 Democratic 
attorneys 
general 
fighting 
to appeal a Texas district 
court 
decision 
that 
ruled 
the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
unconstitutional.
 
In 
her 
announcement, 
Michigan Attorney General 
Dana Nessel said Michigan has 
a strong interest in protecting 
the Affordable Care Act.
 
“The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
provides 
important 
protections 
– 
including 
protecting people with pre-
existing 
conditions 
– 
and 
access to health care for 
hundreds of thousands of 
residents in Michigan,” Nessel 
wrote.
 Nessel’s decision to join 
the lawsuit came in light of 
her 
decision 
to 
withdraw 
Michigan from eight lawsuits 
former Attorney General Bill 
Schuette entered the state in.
 
The 
lawsuit 
seeks 
to 
overrule a decision made in 
December brought forth by 18 

Republican attorneys general 
and 
two 
GOP 
governors. 
The 
lawsuit 
struck 
down 
the entire Affordable Care 
Act on the basis that its 
mandate 
requiring 
people 
to buy health insurance was 
unconstitutional. 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
tax 
plan 
eliminated 
the 
individual 
mandate last year.
 Peter Jacobson, health law 
and policy professor, said he 
expects the Texas decision 
to be overruled, meaning a 
victory for the Democratic 
attorneys general.
 “I suspect that the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals will 
overturn the judge’s decision 
even though it’s a conservative 
court,” Jacobson said. “I think 
that the legal arguments that 
Texas and its supporters are 
making are not compelling. 
The particular challenge in 
the Texas case has always 
struck me as being more about 
politics than law.”
 
The 
expansive 
health 
care coverage has generally 
seen bipartisan support from 
Michigan. 
Not 
long 
after 

the Affordable Care Act was 
originally 
passed, 
former 
Gov. Rick Snyder passed a 
controversial 
expansion 
of 
Medicaid, 
voicing 
support 
for getting more Michigan 
residents covered. Jacobson 
agreed the Affordable Care Act 
has been generally beneficial 
for Michigan residents, citing 
research from the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Center 
for 
Health 
and 
Research 
Transformation.
 “We have fewer people 
lacking 
health 
insurance 
and the state has benefited 
economically,” Jacobson said. 
“Studies from the University 
show that the state has spent 
less money than anticipated 
and the availability of health 
insurance 
has 
actually 
improved 
the 
economy. 
As 
a 
result, 
Michigan’s 
involvement (in the lawsuit) 
is really an investment in 
maintaining those benefits.”
 
LSA 
sophomore 
Dylan 
Berger, 
president 
of 
the 
University’s 
Chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
said 
although 
he 
believes 
the 
Affordable Care Act has 
many shortcomings that 
Michigan needs to address, 
the law should not be 
challenged in court.
“Since 
its 
passage, 
insurance 
costs 
and 
deductibles have increased 
for most Americans while 
quality 
has 
worsened,” 
Berger, 
who 
is 
also 
a 
columnist for The Daily, 
said. “In the meantime, 
however, the Affordable 
Care Act is the law of 
the 
land 
and 
shouldn’t 
be challenged in court. 
Without a well thought 
out 
replacement 
plan, 
repealing the Affordable 
Care 
Act 
would 
be 
disastrous.”
 Law School professor 
Nicholas 
Bagley, 
a 
prominent 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
researcher, 
said 
attorneys 
general 
normally wouldn’t have to 
worry about defending a 
congressional statute –– 
such a task is the job of the 
U.S. Justice Department. 
But because the Justice 

Department hasn’t taken a 
stand on the legality of the 
Affordable Care Act, Bagley 
said states were forced to step 
in.
 “The Trump administration 
made the politically motivated 
decision not to defend the law, 
even though the case against 
the ACA’s constitutionality 
is really weak,” Bagley said. 
“Because 
the 
law 
would 
otherwise lack someone to 
defend it, California and a 
group of blue states intervened 
in the lawsuit. And they’ve 
now 
appealed 
the 
Texas 
district court’s decision.”
 However, Bagley said the 
involvement of Michigan in 
the lawsuit won’t likely have 
large ramifications.
 “Attorney General Nessel 
wants to signal her support for 
the law’s defenders,” Baglesy 
said. “It won’t make much 
of a practical difference. The 
other blue states are already 
involved 
in 
the 
lawsuit, 
whether Michigan jumps in or 
not, but it’s putting Michigan 
firmly on the side of the ACA’s 
supporters.”
 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Kellie 
Lounds, 
chair 
of 
the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, is among 
such supporters, and said she 
is grateful for an attorney 
general who will protect the 
Affordable Care Act.
 “We (College Democrats) 
are thrilled to have an attorney 
general 
who’s 
actually 
acting in the best interest of 
Michigan residents,” Lounds 
said.
 However, the fight to 
appeal the Texas decision 
will not surely end in victory 
for 
Democrats, 
in 
which 
case the Affordable Care Act 
would be brought before the 
Supreme Court for the third 
time. Although the newly 
constituted Supreme Court 
now has five conservative 
justices, Jacobson said he 
is still confident the Texas 
decision would be appealed.
 “I’m dubious that Chief 
Justice Roberts would uphold 
the Texas law,” Jacobson said. 
“I think that the political 
fallout to the court would be 
damaging.”

LSA freshman Lane Kizziah on “Blanco Polo: Michigan softball searches 
to fill the void”:

“This week was the first time we’ve been able to talk to some of the players as well as Coach 

Hutchins. I’ve already read so much about them from previous years, so it was a really 

interesting experience to hear their perspectives in person. 

My story was primarily about how the graduation of one of their star players last year 

would affect the team dynamic this year, so the seniors were able to give some especially 

interesting quotes about how the program has changed over the years. I’m so excited 

to get more time with them and be able to get a deeper understanding of how the team 

functions.”

He will be remembered for his 
decades of public service to the 
people of Southeast Michigan, his 
razor sharp wit and a lifetime of 
dedication to improving the lives 
of all who walk this earth.”
John Dingell recently entered 
hospice care following a cancer 
diagnosis. On Wednesday he 
tweeted that while he was too ill 
to post on social media, Debbie 
Dingell would continue to share 
messages on his behalf.
“The 
Lovely 
Deborah 
is 
insisting I rest and stay off here, 
but after long negotiations we’ve 
worked out a deal where she’ll 
keep up with Twitter for me as 
I dictate the messages,” John 
Dingell tweeted. “I want to thank 
you all for your incredibly kind 
words and prayers. You’re not 
done with me just yet.”
John Dingell retired from 
Congress in 2014. Debbie Dingell, 
who is his wife, won a campaign to 
occupy the seat he vacated.
Debbie 
Dingell 
missed 

President Donald Trump’s State 
of the Union on Tuesday, tweeting 
the following day John Dingell’s 
condition required her to stay 
home.
“Friends 
and 
colleagues 
know me and know I would be 
in Washington right now unless 
something 
was 
up,” 
Debbie 
Dingell wrote. “I am home with 
John and we have entered a new 
phase. He is my love and we have 
been a team for nearly 40 years.”
Debbie 
Dingell 
continued, 
“I will be taking each day as it 
comes. We thank people for their 
friendship and support and ask for 
prayers and privacy during this 
difficult time.”
John Dingell was a staunch 
advocate of the auto industry, 
in 
addition 
to 
promoting 
environmental protections, and 
working to expand health care.
In September, John Dingell was 
hospitalized for more than a week 
following a mild heart attack. After 
being admitted, he tweeted that 
“Rumors of my demise may have 
only been slightly exaggerated.” 
After 
his 
retirement, 
John 
Dingell’s social media accounts 

brought him continued fame. In 
2014, The Atlantic declared his 
Twitter account the best of any 
member of Congress.
On Thursday, President Mark 
Schlissel issued a statement on 
John Dingell’s passing, praising his 
legacy and offering condolences.
“John 
Dingell’s 
resolute 
devotion to the people of Michigan 
and our nation set a high standard 
to which we should all aspire in 
public service,” Schlissel said. 
“He fought for legislation and led 
change that made our state and 
nation better for all Americans 
– including civil rights, access to 
quality medical care, and clean air 
and water. I will always admire 
and remember his decades of 
thoughtful, optimistic leadership, 
grounded 
in 
a 
belief 
that 
healthy communities, economic 
prosperity, and environmental 
stewardship are all values that 
we could relentlessly pursue for 
the betterment of our society. I 
considered John a historically 
significant public servant and man 
of great gravitas.”
 

The Daily contacted multiple 
University officials, including 
representatives of Public Affairs, 
on Friday, Nov. 30, 2018, seeking 
comment for the Dec. 10 article 
about Shipps. OIE first contacted 
Jane on Monday, Dec. 3, 2018. It 
is unclear if OIE had already been 
made aware of Jane’s email, or if 
The Daily’s numerous emails to 
University personnel, including 
Public Affairs sent Nov. 30, 
2018, provoked this response the 
following Monday.
Starting in early December, 
Jane began receiving frequent 
communications from Elizabeth 
Seney, the assistant director and 
deputy Title IX Coordinator for 
Investigations in OIE. These 
communications indicated to her 
that the University had begun to 
take her complaint seriously.
“Elizabeth Seney has called 
me several times (I can’t say 
for sure how many, but I have a 
voicemail from her on 12/8/18), 
and she has emailed many 
times,” Jane wrote to The Daily 
in an email. “In her phone 
messages she was polite and just 
asked that I call her back, and 
that she would explain more 
once I spoke to her.”
***
When 
President 
Richard 
Nixon 
signed 
The 
Higher 
Education Amendments of 1972, 
he created a section commonly 
referred to as “Title IX” law. 
Title IX states: “No person in 
the United States shall, on the 
basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be subjected 
to discrimination under any 
education program or activity 
receiving 
Federal 
financial 
assistance.”
The 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Education’s 
interpretation 
of 
this law has evolved over time 
to include specific provisions 
regarding 
sexual 
violence 
and mandatory reporting of 
such violence. Under recent 
interpretations, the Department 
of Education has stipulated that 
certain employees be designated 
as 
“Responsible 
Employees,” 
employees required to “report 

incidents of sexual violence to 
the Title IX coordinator or other 
appropriate school designee.”
In 
1990, 
the 
federal 
government passed the Clery 
Act. 
The 
Clery 
Act 
places 
separate requirements on school 
employees regarding mandatory 
reporting, such as requiring 
certain employees classified as 
“Campus Security Authorities,” 
or CSAs, to report other serious 
crimes not covered by Title IX 
policy. 
University 
of 
Michigan 
policy combines these various 
reporting obligations into two 
discrete employee categories: 
“Responsible Employees” and 
“Non-Responsible Employees.” 
Responsible Employees include 
deans, 
associate 
deans 
and 
chairs of departments. They 
are commonly referred to as 
“mandatory reporters”. Many 
students will recognize these 
employees for the “RE” stickers 
they often place on their doors.
Responsible Employees are 
required to share allegations of 
“sexual assault, intimate partner 
violence, stalking, sexual or 
gender-based 
harassment, 
retaliation (and) violation of 
interim measures” with the 
University, 
specifically 
with 
OIE.
They are required to report 
these allegations in a timely 
manner, “as soon as possible” 
according 
to 
a 
training 
document on the University 
Human Resources website. They 
must turn over “all of the details 
known to (them), including the 
names of the persons involved, 
when (they) were told, precisely 
what information was shared, 
and (their) contact information.”
***
In October 2017, as the New 
Yorker and The New York Times 
published allegations of sexual 
misconduct 
against 
Harvey 
Weinstein 
and 
the 
cultural 
conversation 
around 
sexual 
misconduct began morphing into 
the #MeToo movement, Jane 
was reminded of her experience 
with Shipps in the late 1970s. 
In mid-October, she decided to 
email Racine. 
“I reached out to Melody 
Racine in October 2017 because 
I (had) recently had contact with 

another victim of Steve Shipps,” 
Jane told The Daily. “That 
certainly ignited something in 
me … I had attended my first 
Women’s March in January 2017 
and I know I was influenced 
by the growing message of 
empowerment for women. I 
felt that it was time to stand up 
for myself. I wasn’t sure who to 
contact, but I found Ms. Racine 
on the University of Michigan 
website.”
On Oct. 21, 2017 at 11:04 p.m., 
Jane sent an email to Racine 
with the subject line “Stephen 
Shipps.” In the email, she alleged 
she was raped by Shipps and 
shared her fears that Shipps had 
committed similar acts against 
other students.
“Recent events in the news 
have sparked memories from 
my past,” Jane wrote. “Honestly, 
I’ve written letters/emails in the 
past but have not sent because 
I didn’t see the point. I guess 
I’m emboldened now. Of course 
I expect absolutely nothing to 
come from this email. I don’t 
know you and there’s nothing 
you or anyone could do at this 
point anyway. So, here’s the 
thing … Stephen Shipps raped 
me when I was sixteen. Over the 
years, I’ve heard stories similar 
to mine regarding Mr. Shipps.”
Jane waited for a response 
from the University.
“My allegations seemed pretty 
serious, so I was a bit surprised 
and hurt that there was no 
response from Ms. Racine, who I 
felt should have an interest and 
responsibility to protect both the 
University of Michigan as well as 
its students,” she wrote.
After 19 days with no response 
from Racine or the University, 
Jane decided to contact Shipps 
directly.
“I guess I gained confidence 
after sending the first email, and 
was angry that I was ignored, so 
I went ahead and sent an email 
directly to Shipps a couple weeks 
later,” Jane wrote to The Daily. 
“It was a big step and a bit scary 
for me to sign my name to that 
email.” 
Jane sent an email to Shipps on 
Nov. 9, 2017 at 2:58 p.m. A copy of 
this email was provided to The 
Daily, though Jane has asked its 
full contents not be published. In 

this message, Jane describes her 
experience with Shipps. She also 
indicates she has heard he has 
committed similar misconduct 
against other students.
“What happened was actually 
statutory rape,” Jane wrote to 
Shipps. “I’ve lived with this for 
a long time. In case you don’t 
remember, it was probably 1978 
or 1979. I’d hope that you didn’t 
engage in this behavior with 
other young women, but I’ve 
heard that you did.”
***
On Oct. 21, 2017, the date she 
received Jane’s email, Racine 
was serving as the interim dean 
of the Music, Theatre & Dance 
School — a position classified 
both as a Responsible Employee 
and 
a 
Campus 
Security 
Authority. She held this position 
until September 2018, though 
she is currently on leave for the 
2018-2019 academic year.
She went on leave shortly 
after David Daniels, a Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor, was 
accused of sexual assault by 
opera singer Samuel Schultz. An 
investigation published by The 
Daily in November found Racine 
signed off on Daniels’ tenure 
application in May 2018, despite 
reports of sexual misconduct 
against Daniels being filed with 
OIE against him in March.
On Nov. 9, 2017, the date he 
received Jane’s email, Shipps was 
serving as the chair of Strings, 
a position he held until Dec. 7, 
2018 and a position that similarly 
classified him as a Responsible 
Employee and a Campus Security 
Authority. He had previously 
served as the associate dean 
for Academic Affairs in the 
Music, Theatre & Dance School, 
and the faculty director of the 
Strings Preparatory Academy, 
both positions classified as a 
Responsible Employee.
The incident Jane alleges 
occurred before Shipps worked 
at the University. As Shipps 
was a Responsible Employee, 
reporting this incident would 
have been self-incriminatory. 
While the University’s policy 
does not cover this specific type 
of situation, the Haven Training 
for Faculty and Staff, a training 
about 
sexual 
misconduct 
reporting 
all 
Responsible 

Employees have to take every 
year to renew their status, makes 
Shipps’ and Racine’s reporting 
obligations quite clear.
“Schools must respond to 
sexual violence connected to 
the school’s education programs 
and activities, including academic, 
educational, extracurricular, and 
athletic activities,” the document 
notes. “If you are made aware of an 
incident involving a perpetrator 
from a different school: … if you 
are a Responsible Employee or 
CAS, this is a reportable incident. 
Follow your institution’s reporting 
policy.”
As such, Shipps and Racine 
were required under University 
policy to report the emails they 
received from Jane to OIE “as soon 
as possible upon learning of the 
behavior.”
It’s unclear if this happened in 
the year between when Jane sent 
her original emails and when she 
received a response. 
Though 
University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
refused 
to 
comment 
on 
the 
specifics of this case, she did 
describe the general process OIE 
uses when they learn of these 
concerns. She also noted that 
though it might have taken Jane 
a long time to hear from OIE, 
this does not necessarily mean an 
investigation of this complaint has 
not taken place.
“When OIE receives information 
about concerns, it assesses the 
information reported to identify — 
and take — appropriate next steps,” 
Broekhuizen said. “This process 
normally includes outreach to the 
person reporting the information, 
to provide them with details about 
resources and any options that 
may be available to them, and to 
gather additional information as 
necessary to review the concerns. 
In any instance, we would regret 
if that outreach didn’t happen, 
or didn’t happen quickly. But 
that does not mean a review or 
investigation of the allegations did 
not take place.”
***
On Oct. 29, 2018 at 11:04 a.m. 
— one year, one week, and one 
day after she first emailed Racine 
— Jane received an email from 
Margie Pillsbury, the University 
of Michigan Police Department 
Special Victims Unit detective 

within 
DPSS. 
In 
this 
email, 
Pillsbury stated she learned of 
Jane’s complaint that day. She 
offered to help connect Jane 
to law enforcement officials in 
the jurisdiction relevant to her 
complaint. 
She 
also 
provided 
Jane 
with 
information 
about 
confidential resources for sexual 
assault survivors.
The 
circumstances 
behind 
Pillsbury’s Oct. 29, 2018 email 
remain unclear. It is unclear why it 
took Pillsbury more than a year to 
respond to Jane’s initial email, and 
if Pillsbury has knowledge of both 
emails or only one.
It also remains unclear how 
Pillsbury 
became 
aware 
of 
Jane’s email on Oct. 29, 2018. 
University policy for “Responsible 
Employees,” as referenced above, 
required 
Jane’s 
email 
to 
be 
reported to the OIE, not DPSS. At 
this point in time, it is unclear if 
OIE was aware of Jane’s complaint.
When The Daily reached out 
to Pillsbury for comment, she 
forwarded the request to UMPD 
spokesperson Melissa Overton. 
Overton 
could 
not 
answer 
questions pertaining to the specific 
case.
***
Jane’s 
next 
communication 
from the University came Dec. 
3, 2018 at 1:23 p.m., when she 
received an email from Seney. This 
was the first time Jane received 
communications from OIE. At this 
point, it had been 13 months since 
Jane sent her email to Racine, and 
it had been five weeks since she 
was contacted by Pillsbury.
“The first emails from Margie 
Pillsbury (then later Elizabeth Seney) 
were a year after I first contacted 
Ms. Racine,” Jane said. “At first I 
didn’t respond because I was just 
busy and felt I didn’t have the time 
or emotional energy to talk about 
the assault. I soon realized that 
something must have happened to 
spur them to action, and I wondered 
whose side they were on. They didn’t 
gain my confidence when I read ‘The 
University takes sexual misconduct 
very seriously …’ I felt like the 
sentence needed clarification as 
to what exactly makes them take 
sexual misconduct seriously, and 
what the tipping point might be.”

Additionally, those who do not 
disclose their felony charges and 
convictions face consequences up to, 
and including, dismissal.
Since its enactment, the policy 
has garnered attention and criticism 
among faculty.
Laurita Thomas, associate vice 
president for Human Resources, 
said the policy was created with the 
intention of making sure all members 
of the community feel safe on campus.
“We 
became 
aware 
of 
circumstances 
where 
we 
were 
not aware of this kind of situation 
across higher ed — not necessarily at 
Michigan,” Thomas said. “And many 
institutions have moved to enhance 
the safety of our community, and this 
knowledge will help us do that.”

L. Rowell Huesmann, professor 
of

the 
policy 
infringes on the rights of students,

with felonies.
“I’m old enough to remember 
very clearly the Vietnam era and 
the Civil Rights era when a lot of 
University of Michigan faculty and 
students demonstrated, not just in 
Michigan but in the South, and a lot 
of them were arrested, a lot of them 
were charged,” Huesmann said. “And 
police liked to charge them with 
felonies, like resisting arrest.”
Huesmann discussed how the 
requirement to report all felony 
charges, regardless of whether an 
individual is guilty or not, could 
restrict free speech. He said the 
policy could instill a sense of fear into 
community members and make them 
question actions they have a right to 
exercise, such as peaceful protesting.
“I suspect it (arrests at protests) 
could easily happen again and people 
could engage in demonstrations 
and protests about civil rights and 
they could well be charged with the 
felony of resisting arrest, and this 
policy requires them within one 
week to report it to the University,” 
Huesmann said. “And that really is 
going to have an inhibiting effect on 
what people do.”
Huesmann sent an email to 
the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs voicing his 
concerns. He said he hopes the 
committee will issue a statement 
opposing the policy.
* * *
Law professor Samuel Gross said 
this policy should not interfere with 
current dismissal procedures.
“Michigan is an ‘employment-at-
will state,’ but the University policy 
on 
employment 
is 
considerably 
more restrictive,” Gross said. “Your 
boss could fire you (in the state of 
Michigan) because he’d rather hire 
his nephew, or because you came into 
work late once, or because you were 
in possession of marijuana. There’s 
no problem with that because they 
can also fire you for no reason. The 
University is much more restricted 
by its own policies.”
Thomas said the University will 
review the cases fairly and not use the 
policy as an excuse to fire employees.
“If you review our discipline 
policies in our SPG, we move toward 
a fair approach and process,” Thomas 
said. “We do not discharge people on 
a lark.” 
Another concern about the policy 
is whether the need to report not only 
convictions, but charges as well, is a 

violation of due process.
Ashley Lucas, director of the 
Prison Creative Arts Project and 
associate professor of theatre and 
drama, said in an email interview 
with The Daily the policy infringes 
on the rights of employees during 
the assessment process, when the 
University must act as a judge and 
determine the consequences for a 
felony charge.
“A 
requirement 
to 
report 
felony 
charges 
puts 
University 
administrators 
in 
the 
position 
of having to evaluate the guilt or 
innocence of a person who has not 
yet had the opportunity to have their 
case adjudicated in a court of law,” 
Lucas wrote. “This is a violation of 
our right to due process.”
Gross said while being charged 
with a crime is not the same as 
being convicted, an employer has 
the right to know and there is 
nothing intrinsically wrong with the 
gathering of all information.
“It is the case, and it’s very 
important, that being accused of a 
crime or arrested for a crime or held 
in pre-trial detention is not in itself 
proof or anything like proof that you 
committed a crime, and can’t be the 
subject of some types of actions,” 
Gross said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s 
not a fact that people can’t be made 
aware of … and that’s something an 
employer is entitled to know about.”
Thomas claimed the University 
is not violating employees’ right 
to due process and the safety of 
the community is the number one 
priority.
“Felony 
charges 
are 
very 
serious,” Thomas said. “It means 
that they have found enough 
evidence to do the charge, and 
so we will review charges in 
order to ensure the safety of our 
community.”
Gross 
discussed 
how 
the 
University 
could 
find 
out 
about all felony charges and 
convictions regardless of self-
reporting by simply going to 
the police and asking for a list. 
However, 
the 
requirement 
of self-disclosure makes the 
process more convenient for the 
University.

A tribute to the engineer

D

espite 
the 
havoc 
that 

continues to be wreaked on 

our natural world, there is no 

doubt that we are making substantial 

strides to improve the quality of our 

environment. At this point, one of the 

most prominent issues is how we can 

implement green practices into our 

daily lives — a problem I would turn to 

engineers to solve.

In this mercenary society, it’s 

not good enough to be green. It’s 

not enough to say that the problems 

we see with the fluctuations of our 

environment will be fixed as long as 

we employ methods that limit the 

consequences, which have essentially 

consisted of using renewable energy, 

reducing waste and rationing our 

goods and materials. We have to think 

about how we can sustain a lifestyle 

that reduces these negative effects 

that we impose on the environment. In 

other words, we know our innovations 

and efforts are driven to serve an 

urgent purpose in our society, but we 

have to make sure they are feasible 

in the sense they can be continually 

implemented in concurrence with our 

economic and social values.

In terms of the people we should 

look toward for progressing — and, 

ultimately, accomplishing— this goal, I 

would wholeheartedly put my trust in 

the hands of engineers. As an aspiring 

engineer whose intellectual abilities 

and character have been enriched 

by 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Engineering community, I am proud 

to say we are becoming more than 

what misconceptions and stereotypes 

assume about our characters and our 

priorities. This University’s efforts to 

make our roles in our communities 

more meaningful has transformed the 

idea of what it means to be an engineer. 

As a witness of these milestones, I am 

confident this movement promoted 

in many institutions will translate 

to the rebirth of a society that will 

unequivocally consider all of its 

sectors, including the environment, in 

terms of how it functions and how it 

progresses.

The curriculum for engineers at 

this University is not only preparing us 

to be intellectually capable of working 

on 
our 
society’s 
infrastructure, 

communication and transportation 

issues, but is also prioritizing our 

knowledge of how to be cohesive 

members of the workforce in the 

process. Even as a freshman who has 

only been studying at the University 

for two semesters, I have taken classes 

embedded with the importance of 

how what we learn applies to the 

real world. We have wasted no time 

taking prerequisites, first-year writing 

requirements, or other classes that 

may or may not relate to our majors. 

We will all have taken the engineering 

core classes, which I view not as a 

pesky requirement but as an essential 

foundation for the information we will 

need to apply to our work once we are 

pursuing our specialized majors. All 

the while, we are taught to understand 

how the various disciplines within 

engineering — as well as other 

sectors, such as business or public 

health — are affected as a result of 

implementing specific concepts we 

have learned. In addition to acquiring 

essential knowledge, the curriculum 

demands I am aware of the effects of 

the decisions I make, a gesture that is 

preparing me to make decisions in life 

that will satisfy the goals I have while 

not preventing others from achieving 

their agendas.

In 
addition 
to 
intellectual 

breadth, 
the 
University 
is 
also 

continuing 
to 
promote 
social 

versatility, psychological flourishing 

and a sense of community among its 

engineering students. In an article 

written by Kate McAlpine for The 

Michigan Engineering News Center, 

she highlights the plans Anthony 

Waas, department chair of Aerospace 

Engineering, has to raise awareness 

for the entire University’s Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion campaign:

“While we try to invite a diverse 

range of speakers to give lectures on 

aerospace topics, we haven’t brought 

in speakers who can speak of their 

research on diversity. To address 

this, our department will invite 

speakers to give public seminars 

about the changing landscape in 

society and how we can mirror it in 

our department.”

In 
essence, 
Waas’ 
efforts 

to diversify the ideas heard by 

aerospace engineering students will 

enable these students to recognize 

the validity of leaders in the field who 

come from different backgrounds. 

The 
campaign 
will 
also 
help 

students develop communication 

skills in which they will be able to 

simultaneously convey and respect 

ideas with one another. This is only 

one of the ways that the University is 

expanding the realm of collaboration 

for engineers in all of its disciplines. 

Furthermore, while often forgotten, 

the strides made in the field of 

engineering 
today 
demonstrate 

themselves as an inclusive effort by 

nature.

I believe this inclusive state 

of mind can apply directly to the 

strife we face in improving the 

quality of our environment. The 

heart of this mentality is that we are 

psychologically aware and capable of 

making decisions with consideration 

of how they will affect others. Thus, 

we will have to compromise what’s 

best for the environment and best 

for the economy and best for society 

as we seek to find balance between 

all. At the root of change in any 

aspect of our lives is social change, 

a type of change that encompasses 

a massive pyschological adjustment 

by everyone in a society. With 

monumental change comes massive 

responsibility and massive effort, 

and I believe it is the grit, resilience 

and persistence engineers harness 

that will allow us to create the scale 

of change required to achieve a 

sustainable balance between all 

sectors of our society.

FROM THE DAILY

 On the government shutdown
B

etween the dates of Dec. 22, 2018, and Jan. 25, 2019, the United States 
government was partially shut down after President Donald Trump 
refused to sign any funding bills that did not include the $5.7 billion 

he wanted for his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. This 35-day shutdown 
was the longest in American history, and resulted in more than 420,000 
federal workers being furloughed, an estimated 0.13 percent of economic 
quarterly growth lost per week and wasn’t ended until Trump ultimately 
agreed to sign a stopgap bill, funding the government through Feb. 15. 

Trump, 
however, 
still 

doesn’t have his wall, which 
he desperately wants. Despite 
many 
people 
— 
including 

some who voted for Trump — 
blaming him for the shutdown, 
Trump 
has 
threatened 
to 

either 
declare 
a 
national 

emergency or shut down the 
government once again if not 
given his desired wall funds.

While 
the 
Democratic 

Party should advocate for 
its political principles, it is 
important to remember that 
the well-being of the American 
people is the most important 
issue 
the 
party 
should 

focus on. Thus, avoiding a 
government shutdown should 
be a goal high on the agenda, 
as 
so 
many 
Americans’ 

livelihoods 
depend 
on 
an 

open 
and 
well-functioning 

federal government. Trump’s 
hardheadedness means that 
it is likely that he ultimately 
rejects 
anything 
the 

Democrats put forward.

However, 
the 
Democrats 

completely giving up on the 
negotiation 
process 
would 

not be ideal either. Both 
a 
shutdown 
and 
national 

emergency 
would 
cause 

chaos, and the adults in the 
room should at least try to 
do what they can to avoid 
either scenario. The sitting 
administration has taken such 
malevolent policy positions 
that 
means 
attempting 
to 

find middle ground would, 
in effect, turn the Democrats 
into 
co-conspirators 
in 
a 

marginally less objectionable 
crime. The optics of extending 
a hand across the aisle may 
prove politically advantageous 
for them going forward. While 
it seems unlikely that Trump 
would accept anything the 
Democrats sign off on, the 
party can still take the high 
road. To be clear, since it is 
the Republicans — not the 
Democrats — insisting their 
demands be met, Democrats 
are 
under 
no 
practical 

obligation to come to the 
table, though they certainly 
have the right to pursue such 
a tactic.

Going 
forward, 
Trump 

has placed himself in an 
extremely tight position in 
regards to the wall, leaving 
him little room for success 
or recovery. After Democrats 
and Republicans were able to 
compromise on a bill which 
allocated $1.3 billion to border 
security back in December, 
Trump 
initially 
said 
he 

would agree to sign it — but 
ultimately ended up reneging. 
It is also worth noting that 
in March 2018, Democrats 
were ready and willing to 
give the administration the 
full $25 billion it wants for 
the construction of a border 
wall in exchange for a path 
to 
citizenship 
for 
DACA 

recipients, but this was also 
turned down.

While polls show that 59 

percent of Americans oppose 
the wall, Trump, out of fear 
of losing his core base of 
supporters, has been driven 
away 
from 
compromise 

and towards more extreme 
options. 
With 
Congress 

seemingly content to go on 
without funding for a wall in 
place, Trump’s two options 
appear to be another shutdown 
or declaring a state of national 
emergency — unfortunately 
for him, neither are very 
popular nor promising.

First, of course, Trump 

could do what he has already 
done 
and 
shut 
down 
the 

government. 
However, 
it’s 

unclear what exactly that 
would accomplish. This could 
prove politically perilous, as 
Trump bore most of the brunt 
for the last shutdown and the 
multitude of negative effects 
should not be compounded 
by taking such a disastrous 
course 
of 
action 
again. 

Secondly, 
Trump 
could 

declare a national emergency. 
However, 
that 
would 
be 

unpopular 
among 
Senate 

Republicans, a group who has 
previously, for the most part, 
stood behind him. In addition 
to being unpopular, declaring 
a national emergency could 
also be unconstitutional.

While the Supreme Court 

has a history of favoring 
executive power, Trump isn’t 
exactly 
strengthening 
his 

case for a national emergency 
by 
threatening 
to 
declare 

one if Congress doesn’t do 
his 
bidding. 
Emergencies 

are supposed to be declared 
when congressional approval 
would be too slow to handle an 
emerging crisis, so patiently 
waiting 
before 
declaring 

one runs contrary to the 
assertion that the matter at 
hand is an “emergency” at all. 
Since the recent government 
shutdown proved to be an 
exercise in futility, Trump 
ultimately does seem to be 
leaning towards the national 
emergency route. 

As mentioned earlier, it 

seems unlikely that Trump 
would accept any deal the 
Democrats 
would 
propose. 

However, seeing as though 
he seems to be in a rather 
desperate position, it might 
make sense to re-propose a 
path to citizenship for DACA 
recipients in exchange for 
the $5.7 billion. If Democrats 
were, at one point, ready to fork 
over $25 billion for a DACA 
path to citizenship, then this 
deal would effectively save 
$19.3 billion that would have 
gone toward a project that 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi decried 
as “immoral” just last month.

We look toward Feb. 15 and 

hope for the best. Arriving 
at an equitable solution to 
this looming problem is an 
absolute necessity and the 
soul of our nation depends on 
it. We urge that our elected 
officials do their jobs and 
uphold their oath to do what’s 
best for their country and 
their constituencies.

Will the border wall run through Berlin?

O

n the morning of Aug. 
13, 1961, the residents of 
Berlin awoke to discover 

that the Communist government 
of East Germany had ordered the 
construction of a wall to divide 
the eastern and western halves 
of the city. Designed to prevent 
civilian defections from Soviet 
Bloc East Germany to democratic 
West Germany, the wall stood for 
nearly three decades until the fall 
of communism in Europe in 1989. 
To the capitalist democracies of 
the West, the Berlin Wall was a 
concrete symbol of the existential 
struggle between Western freedom 
and Soviet tyranny. While the exact 
number is difficult to determine, 
one BBC study claims 262 East 
German civilians died at the wall 
while attempting to defect to West 
Germany. It’s no wonder the wall’s 
November 1989 dismantling was 
met with triumphant celebration by 
East and West Germans alike. Two 
million East Berliners poured into 
West Berlin during the weekend-
long 
celebration 
that 
followed 

reunification. One British journalist 
described the festivities as “the 
greatest street party in the history 
of the world.” A wave of optimism 
washed over Germany’s capital; 
Europe, they knew, was about to 
experience a new birth of freedom.

The section of the wall that 

divided East and West Berlin, a 
notorious symbol of communist 
oppression that it was, spanned only 
27 miles. The U.S.-Mexico border is 
nearly 2,000 miles. With the border 
greater than the distance between 
Ann Arbor and Seattle, much of 
it rolls through the empty sands 
of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan 
Deserts. Near El Paso, Texas, that 
long line meets the lazy Rio Grande, 
a meandering river that forms the 
rest of the border until it empties into 
the Gulf of Mexico. Since 1998, 7,216 
migrants have died trying to cross 
this border — more than 27 times the 
number of people killed between the 
two Berlins. 

America’s 
southern 
border, 

of course, is no Berlin Wall. The 
Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart, 
as the East German government 
called it, was designed to prevent 
East Germans from escaping their 
totalitarian prison. Tragedies at the 
Rio Grande or in the Sonoran Desert, 
however upsetting, are the result of 
America protecting the integrity of 
its borders, which any country has 
the right to do. But a consideration 

of migrant push factors renders the 
geopolitics not entirely different. 
While 
some 
East 
Germans 

fled westward due to political 
considerations, many fled in pursuit 
of economic opportunity and better 
living conditions. Undocumented 
immigrants from Central America, 
of course, seek entry into the U.S. 
for the same reasons. Let me be 
clear: Laredo 2019 is no Berlin 
1979. But they clearly bear some 
political similarities — and in terms 
of a humanitarian crisis, the human 
cost of America’s chronic border 
headache far surpasses Berlin’s.

While it has always been a staple of 

President Donald Trump’s rhetoric, 
the border wall fiasco returned to 
the fore of national politics when the 
now resolved government shutdown 
began on Dec. 22. Demanding that 
Congress allocate $5.7 billion for the 
construction of a border wall, Trump 
refused to sign a budget plan without 
that 
critical 
provision. 
House 

Democrats, who control the lower 
chamber of Congress as of Jan. 3, 
wouldn’t budge. Without an agreed-
upon federal budget, the war over 
the wall ballooned into a month-long 
government shutdown, costing the 
American economy $11 billion and 
forcing 800,000 federal employees 
to work for a month without pay. 

The government shutdown was 

an unforced error by the president. 
Trump, for whom border bombast 
has served as a perennial go-to, has 
been promising a border wall since 
he launched his campaign in 2015. 
Little progress has been made on 
that front, and Trump lunged at the 
opportunity to show some concrete 
commitment — even if it required 
a government shutdown. After a 
month, the shutdown ended with a 
temporary three-week reopening 
of the government, with the hope 
being that Congress could reach a 
long-term budget resolution in that 
time. No such deal has been struck 
yet, meaning another government 
shutdown looms on the horizon. 
But it doesn’t need to happen. If 
the president were as shrewd a 
political navigator as he frequently 
claims, he’d retreat from, rather 
than reinforce, all the border wall 
talk. Not only is it a bad solution for 
border security, it’s a losing fight that 
will only continue to reflect poorly on 
Trump.

First and foremost, a wall on 

America’s southern border won’t 
end illegal immigration. Most 
undocumented 
immigrants, 
in 

fact, enter the U.S. legally and 
then overstay their work visas. It 
also won’t stop illegal drugs from 
“pouring into our country,” as 
Trump has repeatedly claimed. 
The majority of cartel narcotics 
from Mexico are brought to the U.S. 
through legal ports of entry.

Plain and simple, a border wall 

is not the anti-migrant, anti-drug 
panacea Trump claims it would be. 
But that fact, along with the reality 
that Democrats will never entertain 
its funding, seems to be lost on our 
commander-in-chief. For a man 
who cares so deeply about his 
popularity, it would seem that if 
pragmatic politics isn’t a primary 
concern, perhaps it is poll numbers 
that are informing his behavior. 
But an explanation can’t be found 
there, either. Less than a third of 
Americans would support a second 
government shutdown to acquire 
border wall funding, and a majority 
would blame Trump if another 
shutdown occurs. What’s more, 
nearly 70 percent of Americans 
believe the wall shouldn’t be an 
immediate priority, and half say it 
shouldn’t be a priority at all.

Any way you look at it, a border 

wall is practically unreasonable, 
politically 
unattainable 
and 

publicly 
unpopular. 
But 
even 

so, Trump’s relentless push for 
building a “big, beautiful” border 
wall 
has 
always 
been 
more 

symbolic than practical — and its 
consequences would be symbolic 
as well. As The Boston Globe’s 
Jeff Jacoby writes, Trump’s long-
sought barrier “would be ‘great’ 
only in its brutal ugliness and 
hideous symbolism. It would be an 
American version of the monstrous 
Berlin Wall.”

American 
pressure 
helped 

topple the Berlin Wall in the fall 
of 1989. When Ronald Reagan 
traveled to West Berlin in the 
summer of 1987, he delivered a 
speech in which he challenged the 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
to destroy the infamous barrier 
dividing Berlin. “Mr. Gorbachev,” 
he pronounced, “Tear down this 
wall!” Two years later, the Berlin 
Wall was reduced to rubble. Now, 
three decades on, America must 
ask itself a question: Do we really 
want to pick up the wall’s pieces 
and rebuild it here?

“Those goody-good people 
who worked shitty jobs for bum 
paychecks and took the subway 
to work every day and worried 
about their bills were dead. If we 
wanted something, we just took 
it. If anyone complained twice 
they got hit so bad, believe me, 
they never complained again.”
These 
are 
the 
words 
of 
none other than Henry Hill, 
one of the most fascinating 
gangsters to ever live. He is 
both a very real person and the 
quietly ironic, flawed antihero 
of 
Martin 
Scorsese’s 
biopic 
“Goodfellas.” 
The 
film 
was 
adapted, often verbatim, from 
“Wiseguy,” Nicholas Pileggi’s 
nonfictional chronicle of Hill’s 
life, remaining largely true to 
the 
man’s 
experiences. 
I’ve 
always 
loved 
crime 
stories, 
especially 
those 
about 
the 
intricate inner workings of a 
sprawling organization or with 

the charming wit of a film like 
“Goodfellas.” But it wasn’t until 
I read the film’s source material 
that I started to question the 
relationship between organized 
crime and the importance of its 
filmic parallels.
Surely, 
the 
two 
are 
not 
mirrors of each other. But in the 
case of “Goodfellas,” much of 
the heart, shaky morality and 
general tone remained identical 
from the nonfiction book to the 
dramatized movie. The thing 
about organized crime in film, 
however, is that there isn’t 
simply one brand of it. For as 
long as I’ve been watching crime 
stories, I’ve noticed just how 
eclectic they can be, a range of 
different stories based on the 
different 
locales, 
ideologies, 
backgrounds and values. I want 
to take a deeper look into the 
differences among these stories 
to more completely understand 
what they say about our daring 
and our flaws. This is the first 
installment in a series where I’ll 
examine several of the varieties 

through which organized crime 
manifests onto film.
The first lens I’ll glance 
into is a cultural one. How 
exactly 
does 
ethnicity 
and 
region 
affect 
the 
structure, 
process, and idiosyncrasies of 
a criminal organization? It’s no 
easy question to answer, so for 
simplicity’s sake, we can narrow 
our focus to three films.
To start with, “The Departed” 
is probably the most iconic 
Boston crime story, showcasing 
a largely Irish mob. It is distinct 
from its genre siblings in its 
small town feel, ruminations 
about identity in crime and 
detachment from the narratives 
that 
govern 
similar 
stories. 
Next, I’ll examine the pinnacle 
of Italian crime sagas and the 
modern standard for American 
cinema, “The Godfather” series. 
What these films do best in the 
light of cultural meaning is to 
construct a living, breathing 
world where the complex and 
hierarchical structure of the 
mafia 
exists 
naturally 
and 

understandably to any audience. 
Both “The Godfather” and “The 
Departed” won the Academy 
Award 
for 
Best 
Picture 
in 
1973 
and 
2003 
respectively, 
but the equally iconic film 
that 
completes 
this 
unholy 
triumvirate of modern American 
crime stories was infamously 
snubbed for the Oscar in 1991.
There’s no better example of 
a film that combines these two 
culturally disparate depictions 
of 
organized 
crime 
than 
“Goodfellas,” with Hill himself 
being half-Sicilian and half-
Irish. From there, the options 
to explore are as numerous as 
the term “organized crime” is 
amorphous. There’s not just 
one kind of crime, and there’s 
certainly not just one kind of 
crime story.
***

“The Departed,” at its essence, 
is an exceptionally smart movie 
about cops and criminals saying 
incredibly inane things to each 
other. Saturated with more than 
its fair share of quotable one-
liners and snarky moments, the 
movie is an equally intellectual 
story of the police and the 
mob sending traitors into each 
other’s 
organizations. 
While 
identity in “The Departed” can 
play a crucial role in accruing 
authority or hiding motivation, 
a conflict of identity is also the 
downfall of many of the film’s 
characters. The result is a tense 
and often muddled relationship 
between the perpetrators and 
the persecutors of crime.

Key to this dichotomy, as 
stated throughout the film, is 
the concept of being Irish. Vera 
Farmiga plays a psychiatrist at 
the Massachusetts State Police 
Department and delves into this 
cultural contradiction. At one 
point, Matt Damon’s character, 
Collin Sullivan, realizes the 
struggle she faces, admitting to 
her, “You’re up shit’s creek with a 
client list full of Mick cops.” The 
film continually reinforces the 
Irish as having a tendency to veil 
their emotions, tying this theme 
to the conciliatory nature of the 
criminal and police enterprises. 
Not only do the Irish in the film 
value reservation and stoicism 
as a part of who they are, but 
they 
find 
that 
these 
traits 
become necessary for survival 
in a underworld of shadows, 
calculation and betrayal.
Another distinctly fascinating 
feature of the film’s Irish mob is 
that criminals are not singularly 
concerned 
with 
power 
or 
hierarchy. 
Of 
course, 
there 
is a head to the organization, 
Frank Costello, played by an 
entertainingly overacting Jack 
Nicholson. But other than him, 
none of the other gangsters 
care much about the control 
they wield. They seem more 
concerned with the money and 
the sheer joy of recklessness. 
During one conversation, Leo 
DiCaprio’s Billy Costigan says 
to Costello, “I probably could 
be you. I know that much. But I 
don’t wanna be you, Frank.”
On the other hand, the police 
force is more akin to other 

criminal organizations in film, 
with a cutthroat structure and 
a web of secrets. “Work hard 
and you’ll rise fast with the 
best possible position in the 
department,” announces Alec 
Baldwin’s Captain Ellerby, near 
the film’s start. Those who 
succeed 
in 
the 
department, 
such as Sullivan (the mole), 
do so through deception and 
less-than-legal 
practices. 
For 
example, Sullivan impersonates 
a convict’s lawyer to extract 
information 
from 
him. 
In 
the 
ambition 
to 
associate 
cops with criminals, Martin 
Scorsese actually portrays the 
Massachusetts 
State 
Police 
Department 
to 
a 
mob-like 
organization, 
perhaps 
even 
more so than the mob itself. The 
director’s fascination with moral 
ambiguity is not unique to this 
film, but might just display itself 
most brazenly and effectively 
here. The result is a brilliant 
twist on the typical dynamics 
of crime stories and a mockery 
of 
the 
prescribed 
identities 
we 
assign 
to 
government 
institutions.
“The Departed” is all about 
paradoxes. 
The 
paradox 
of 
Irish reservation and sculpting 
identity, 
the 
paradox 
of 
committing 
and 
preventing 
crimes, the paradox of deep 
narrative complexity and the 
curt dialogue of wise guys. It’s 
an ordeal of oxymorons, but one 
that manages to hold distinct 
place in the canon of organized 
crime films.

Until now, each new Girlpool 
album has signalled a momentous 
stylistic change for the duo — the 
strikingly sparse shouting-and-
strumming of their self-titled 
EP gave way to an elegant and 
idiosyncratic indie in 2015’s Before 
The World Was Big, and rather 
than settling into this style in the 
manner of Frankie Cosmos and 
Snail Mail, they toughened 
and saturated their sound 
in 
2017’s 
Powerplant. 
Each 
evolution 
of 
their 
sound has felt deliberate, 
their music retaining its 
essential characteristics as 
the duo gained confidence 
and 
explored 
new 
sonic 
horizons. While this stylistic 
restlessness 
continues 
— 
Cleo Tucker recently said in 
an interview for Document 
Journal that he is “so over 
rock music” — their newest 
album What Chaos Is Imaginary is 
less an upending than a synthesis 
of the styles the band has surveyed 
so far and a careful glance in a 
new direction.
The new material is subtle, 
like a filter on a photograph. 
There are several songs on the 
new album that would fit in on 
Powerplant, and the newness is 
mostly layered atop this solid 
foundation. A few songs are 
adorned with the incandescent 
glow of an electric organ, there 

are occasional experiments with 
drum machines, the recording 
and production style is generally 
thicker and dreamier, a few 
songs remind the less submerged 
moments 
in 
Beach 
House’s 
discography. Possibly the most 
striking moment on the album is 
the title track, on which Harmony 
Tividad’s voice hovers over a 
sparse arrangement that is later 
unexpectedly (but seamlessly) 
joined by a string quartet. It 
almost brings to mind Lana Del 

Rey in its expansive sweep; it 
made me feel as though Girlpool 
were always destined for this 
scale. That the following track, 
“Hoax And The Shrine,” opens 
with 
an 
unadorned 
acoustic 
guitar is a reminder of the band’s 
scope — the album hangs together 
improbably well considering the 
eclecticism of its materials.
Between 
the 
recording 
of 
Powerplant and What Chaos Is 
Imaginary, Cleo Tucker began 
his 
gender 
transition, 
which 

included testosterone injections 
that lowered his voice by about an 
octave. Girlpool’s earliest music 
was defined by the close proximity 
of Tucker and Tividad’s voices, 
which sang in close harmony 
when not in unison to the point 
of 
sonic 
indistinguishability. 
While neither of them take the 
role of “fronting” the group now, 
they take turns taking the lead 
instead of singing in unison. This 
separateness mirrors the creative 
process that the duo approached 
for the album — Tividad 
and Tucker were known to 
have a tightly collaborative 
creative process, but for this 
album they lived separately 
and wrote songs on their 
own. Many of the songs on 
this album can be found in 
demo form on Tividad and 
Tucker’s separate bandcamp 
and soundcloud pages, but on 
the album, the other member 
of the duo usually joins in on 
background vocals in a role 
gently supportive rather than 
enmeshed.
If Girlpool’s music is “about” 
anything when considered as 
a whole, it’s about navigating 
a 
burgeoning 
adulthood 
— 
ambition, anxiety, love and its 
nearby feelings, the constant 
shifting of overlapping comfort 
zones. 
While 
Girlpool 
have 
thoroughly matured as musicians, 
the album still lives in the 
yearning mental spaces of their 
first releases, thoroughly elevated 
and expanded.

Girlpool’s latest is stunning

ALBUM REVIEW

I was nearing the end of a 
long overnight shift working 
as an emergency department 
scribe just outside of Ann 
Arbor. It was a slow night, 
having 
only 
seen 
around 
ten patients by halftime at 4 
a.m., so I indulged myself by 
studying for my upcoming 
organic chemistry exam. My 
eyes and I began the end-of-
shift descent into lethargy; I 
began to move more slowly, 
my computer screen seemed 
fuzzier than before and I 
started to inadvertently tune 
out my periphery. I had a few 
hours yet in my shift to get 
through, but I had certainly 
hit the wall. I meandered 
over to the coffee machine 
tucked in the corner of the 
department and grabbed a 
Styrofoam cup. The coffee 
machine looked like it was 
out of the ’90s, with all of its 
once-white 
now 
yellowed, 
and a red Folgers label that 
had faded to burnt pink.
But one should never judge 
a book by its cover, and in 
that vein, one should not 
predict the quality of coffee 
based on the appearance of 
its maker. I crunched the 
“regular” button on the side 
of the machine and watched 
the dark liquid quickly fill 
the cup. After staying my 
hand for a few seconds to 
allow it to cool, I took a sip of 
the hospital coffee.
This 
hospital 
coffee 
was rich. It was rich like 
a Van Boven regular who 
purchases items that aren’t 
on clearance. It was rich like 
someone who can buy a venti 
and only drink a tall’s worth 
of coffee. It was rich like a 

new textbook, even though 
the used copy was drastically 
less expensive.
I am not certain if it was, 
but this hospital coffee sure 
tasted fresh. It was fresh 
like syllabus week or an 
untouched copy of The Daily. 
It was fresh like seeing tour 
groups at the University of 
Michigan for the Class of 

2023. It was fresh like a new 
lab coat, instead of one that 
had just been poorly washed 
from last semester. These 
are all things I’ve seen and/
or done before, like the 
coffee I’ve consumed before, 
but 
there 
is 
undoubtedly 
something 
about 
the 
re-experiences thereof that 
act as catalysts for dusty, 

motivational bursts waiting 
in my pituitary.
This hospital coffee was 
rejuvenating. It was as if I 
had spent a summer abroad, 
in Paris or Rome or Madrid, 
to find myself and finish my 
language requirement. All of 
my curiosities about the world 
refreshed, with an entirely 
new 
set 
of 
experiences 
under my belt. And though I 
enjoyed said time abroad, I 
told everyone that asked that 
I was happy to return home 
and get back into the regular 
swing of things. But even 
after returning home, I kept 
wondering if maybe I didn’t 
utilize 
the 
study 
abroad 
opportunity as well as I 
should have. I mean, study 
abroad is a great opportunity 
that looks great on a resume, 
but maybe I should have 
chosen somewhere different? 
Somewhere more applicable 
for my major? Maybe it didn’t 
matter anyway. I’ve only got 
a couple of years left before 
graduate school. I only had 
a few hours before that shift 
was up. This hospital coffee 
had the same effect as a 
study abroad program, only 
without the debt.
This hospital coffee was 
reassuring. It told me to 
close my organic textbook 
and reassured me that my 
exam would turn out alright. 
It reminded me that I could 
sleep the following day. It 
reminded me that no matter 
when the next patient comes 
in and no matter what they 
present with, during that 
shift or in the distant future, 
the hospital coffee would 
be there. I can’t be certain 
as to whether it will mimic 
this particular episode, but 
I do know that that was one 
phenomenal cup of coffee.

My God, this one made me 
sad.
“Where Reasons End” is a 
string of fictional dialogues 
between a mother and Nikolai, 
her 
deceased 
son. 
Nikolai 
committed suicide. Yiyun Li 
writes about trauma with an 
eloquence so intimate that her 
words read as her truth, and I 
had to look her up. She wrote 
the

in 
the

the

it reads with a 
heaviness that 
sinks 
like

do, until our feet cement in 
some hapless form of ever.
“The unspeakable is a wound 
that stays open always, always, 
and forever … I will be sad today 
and tomorrow, a week from now, 
a year from now. I will be sad 
forever.”
There’s 
a 
sickness 
in 
the 
notion 
of 
forever, 
a 
masturbatory 
kind 
of 
self-
indulgence in thinking you can 
hold a person in your hands 
indefinitely. 
Reeling 
from 
the pain of a loss can be so 
intense that it become easier 
to choose to feel nothing at all. 
Li has filled what would be the 
heaviest kind of nothingness 
with words. She accepts her 
feelings as they come. Death is 
impossible, indisputable, and Li 

deals with it.
Time wasn’t made for us to 
touch, but Li knows better. She 
doesn’t dare toy with tomorrow; 
instead, she strangles a fever 
dream out of today.
“A self is timeless,” Li writes. 
“Tenseless.”
And I can see it. I see her 
time, hear it screeching, watch 
as 
it 
evaporates 
altogether. 
Her language is so entrenched 
in time’s failure to pass, and 
what results is a white-knuckle 

kind of clinging to grief that’s 
expressed 
as 
honestly 
and 
genuinely as anyone can.
“What if, having lived through 
a dark and bleak time, a parent 
can convince a child that what 
we need is not a light that will 
lead us somewhere, but the 
resolution to be nowhere, even if 
it’s ever and forever.”
I don’t know what it means to 
live fully, or to live well, even. 
Life is delicate and unbearably 
breakable, and maybe it’s just 
a 
series 
of 
resolutions: 
an 
acceptance of the time we are 
given, be it boundless or not. 
Light doesn’t always have to be 
burning or fading. Sometimes it 
just needs to be on.
Nikolai’s mother asks him: 
“Life is imperfect, but it does 
mean something, no?”
Choosing to believe life does, 

in fact, mean something, is a 
hope-laden resolve. Life isn’t 
perfect, but it’s enough.
In one of the novel’s more 
overtly harrowing epicenters, 
our narrator recounts showing 
Nikolai a particular line from 
“Sense and Sensibility,” that “to 
wish was to hope, to hope was to 
expect.” Nikolai tasked himself 
with the hope to be perfect, 
and this hope translated into 
a searing belief that unless he 
could be, he had nothing left to 
live for. “Where 
Reasons 
End” 
is 
a 
mother’s 
grief over such a 
dire translation: 
“Who, 
my 
dear child, has 
taken the word 
lovable 
out 
of 
your 
dictionary 
and 
mine, 
and 
replaced it with 
perfect?”
What happens 
to Nikolai isn’t 
tragic 
— 
it’s 
sad. This book 
is 
sad, 
these 
conversations 
are sad. Li has 
created a life in 
this book from 
Nikolai’s 
words 
that’s 
opaque 
and grossly adversary to the 
fluidity of what it means to live. 
She grips time, treats death 
like taffy, and it’s not right or 
wrong. It just is.
Nikolai 
was 
too 
fast 
to 
taste his own freedom. The 
mother in this novel describes 
someone who dies as having 
the “privilege” of not being 
left behind — a sentiment so 
blunt it nearly broke me, as 
did many of Li’s words. Life is 
hard. What we’re doing here 
is so very hard. Unless there’s 
peace nestled inside the rubble 
of each moment, the days start 
to hollow themselves out.
The novel is aptly titled, 
because the dialogues that fill 
this narrative don’t happen 
so much as they simply are, 
like time is, life is, death is: 
reasonless, but present. Always.

‘Where Reasons End’ is an 
indispensable look at grief

BOOK REVIEW

‘Where Reasons End’

Yiyun Li

Feb. 5, 2019

It wasn’t so long ago that death felt like 
riskiest, 
most 
consequential 
choice 
TV 
writers could make. What better way to 
upend a story, discombobulate an audience 
and stir up some water-cooler chatter than 
the grisly, shocking, teary slaughter of a 
beloved character? But two things are making 
that less and less true. First, this is an age 
of experimental television, where every 
narrative convention we take for granted 
is duly ignored. And secondly, everyone 
watching seems to be mired in a comfortable 
sort of nihilism, resigned to spend the rest 
of eternity in the service of Jeff Bezos while 
the Floridian peninsula sinks into a rapidly 
acidifying ocean. It makes mortality feel 
almost quaint. Dying, schmying — we have 
bigger fish to fry (though, you know, those 
falling pH levels are already doing that).
If we’re all doomed to shuffle off this mortal 
coil eventually, shows like NBC’s “The Good 
Place” and Amazon’s “Forever” ask, why not 
use death as an opportunity to re-examine 
the lives we’ve been living? “Russian Doll,” 
Netflix’s cool, caustic, fabulous new entry in 
the death-com genre, gamifies the concept, 
hinging its stakes on the 
journey of self-discovery.
Nadia Vulvokov (Natasha 
Lyonne, “Orange is the New 
Black”), 
a 
curmudgeonly 
video game designer, wakes 
up on the night of her 36th 
birthday in her friend’s outré 
East Village bathroom after 
being fatally hit by a cab. 
And again, after tumbling 
down the stairs. And again 
after falling into a basement 
grate on the sidewalk. “The 
universe is trying to fuck with 
me,” she snarls. “And I refuse 
to engage!” It’s a premise 
probably forever associated 
with “Groundhog Day”: What 
would you do if you were 
stuck indefinitely in a time 
loop? 
Learn 
French? 
Try 
your hand at ice sculpting? 
Attempt to win the heart of 
Andie MacDowell? (Come on, 
we’d all attempt to win the 
heart of Andie MacDowell.)
“Russian Doll” knows it’s 
treading on iconic ground. 
Nadia’s loops all begin with 
the same infectious Harry 
Nilsson song — a nod to the 
clock radio blaring “I Got 
You Babe” that woke Bill 
Murray’s Phil Connors in each of his loops. 
But Nadia attacks her situation with a fierce 

sort of logic that the movie’s misanthropic 
meteorologist never did. She’s a programmer, 
after all. Surely, she reasons, this is some kind 
of bug in life’s code. Was it the drugs she took 
that night? Could her friend’s apartment be 
haunted?
The 
answer 
is 
more 
complicated 
than 
Nadia 
would like it to be. Fixing 
this bug will take unpacking 
years of repressed trauma 
and peeling back the layers of 
her life, much like the titular 
nested 
matryoshka 
doll. 
Luckily, as an early-season 
plot twist reveals, she won’t 
have to go at it alone.
The New York of “Russian 
Doll” is seamy, grungy, a 
little Lynchian. But it’s also 
familiar and brightly-peopled 
— 
like 
a 
cross 
between 
“Mr. Robot” and “Can You 
Ever 
Forgive 
Me?” 
Each 
supporting character — whom 
we come to know a little 
differently in each reboot — is 
affectionately drawn, quirky, 
but always warm. Lyonne 
herself is a standout.
It’s a gem of a show that 
can do what it does in a 
wonderfully tidy half-hour 
format, one a few other shows 
could stand to adopt. The 
compactness leaves “Russian 
Doll” feeling so well-paced 
and densely-plotted that it’s 
probably worth a re-watch 
or two to soak in every last 
detail. Now there’s a never-ending loop I 
wouldn’t mind being stuck in.

Netflix’s ‘Russian Doll’ is 
just clever, charming and 
loopy enough to be iconic

A study in contrasts: ‘M’ packs 
combo of youth and experience

Two years ago, the Michigan 
baseball team had 11 players 
selected in the draft, the most 
by any one school. All eleven of 
them signed contracts. Seven 
were juniors. 
A year later, the absence of 
the seven would-be seniors 
leaves 
some 
gaps 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ lineup. And with 
those gaps come opportunities 
for young players to step into 
bigger roles. 
Michigan’s 
reliance 
on 
younger, 
less-experienced 
players caused the team to 
struggle at points last season. 
The Wolverines got off to a 
slow start, losing 11 of their 
first 15 games. After that, 
though, they went on a tear, 
winning 20 straight games. 
Ultimately, though, the team’s 
collective lack of experience 
caught up to them in the Big 
Ten Tournament. After beating 
Iowa 2-1 in extra innings to 
start the tournament, their 
season ended with consecutive 
losses to Purdue and Ohio State. 
 
But this year, with another 
year of experience, Michigan’s 
younger players look poised 
for success. The team has also 
taken the offseason to get 
stronger and faster, and that 
increased level of physicality 
has already been evident in 
how the team has been playing 
in practice. 
“It’s a little bit of an older 
team, so I see a group of kids 
who’ve had another birthday, 
who’ve gotten stronger, who’ve 
become 
more 
physical, 
so 
I would like to think we’re 
capable of hitting for more 
power this year,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “I like to 
think some of our pitchers 
are going to be stronger, more 
durable. 
We’ve 
seen 
some 
bumps in velocity from some 

of our pitchers, and they look 
more physical on the mound as 
well.”
Among those looking to make 
the jump is Jesse Franklin. The 
sophomore outfielder struggled 
to adjust to college baseball at 
the beginning of his freshman 
season, hitting an average of 
.095 with two hits over his first 
nine games. But he soon found 
his stride, hitting his first of 
a team-high 10 home runs on 
Mar. 20 to kick off a hot streak 
that 
lasted 
several 
weeks. 
Despite his slow start, Franklin 
finished the season with a solid 
.327 average and 47 runs batted 
in. 
Franklin was part of a strong 
freshman 
recruiting 
class 
that stepped into big roles last 
season. Another notable now-
sophomore is right-hander Jeff 
Criswell, who “has a lightning 
bolt for an arm” according to 
Bakich and who will now be 
in competition for a starting 
role. Criswell had a 2.23 ERA 
last season over 32.1 innings of 
relief, pitching several scoreless 
innings and one perfect inning 
in the process. 
Also in a position for a strong 

year is senior Jimmy Kerr, 
who will play at either first or 
third base. Kerr made 19 starts 
at third last year. In 2017, his 
sophomore season, he was part 
of a defensive infield that was 
statistically among the best in 
college baseball. 
“Jimmy Kerr has been in this 
program – this is his fourth 
year now – and he’s earned 
a starting job,” Bakich said. 
“He’s put on a lot of size, a lot of 
strength, a lot of explosiveness, 
he’s hitting the ball with a lot 
of juice in the bat, so it’s really 
good to see.”
Overall, 
expectations 
are 
high for Team 153, whose 
combination 
of 
youth 
and 
experience 
coupled 
with 
improved strength could be 
enough to send the team into a 
deep playoff run this spring. 
“We’ve got our goals set as 
high you can set them, and in 
terms of how we’ve prepared 
and 
being 
around 
these 
guys every day, it feels like a 
championship team,” Bakich 
said. “Everything feels right in 
terms of what type of group this 
could be. It feels like a special 
group.”

Wolverines not focused on rankings

After a disappointing ending 
to a season that was not up to the 
Michigan softball team’s lofty 
aspirations, coach Carol Hutchins 
had a simple answer for the 
softball team’s focus throughout 
the offseason.
“Pitching, offense and defense. 
You know, you catch and throw.”
With the winningest coach in 
college softball at the helm, the 
Wolverines recognize that any 
sort of rebound from last year 
starts with the fundamentals.
Ranked No. 19, according to 
the USA Today, Michigan once 
again is predicted to come out 
victorious in the Big Ten with 
No. 21 Minnesota being the only 
other team from the conference 
appearing in the rankings.
But winning the Big Ten isn’t 
going to be enough for what the 
Wolverines have their sights set 
on. 
“In 
every 
aspect 
of 
our 
program, we are gearing up for 
a chance to be a World Series 
contender,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“That’s the expectation of the 
program, so all we can do is hold 
the standards of the program 

in everything we do, whether 
it’s working hard, whether it’s 
showing up on time, whether it’s 
doing the little things properly.”
Being ranked towards the 
bottom of the top-20 would 
be 
encouraging 
for 
most 
programs. For Michigan, it’s 
uncharacteristic. However, the 
players have their blinders up.
“Honestly, 
we 
don’t 
talk 
rankings in here,” said sophomore 
pitcher Meghan Beaubien. “Like, 
coaches don’t bring it up. I don’t 
think the team has brought it up 
as a group, it’s just not something 
we focus on. Because ultimately, 
the preseason ranking doesn’t 
mean anything when you get to 
the end of the year. So much time 
and anyone can beat anyone, you 
know.”
“We try to not pay attention 
to 
rankings, 
what 
happens 
outside of us,” added junior third 
baseman Madison Uden. “I mean, 
we have our own little thing 
where we just try keep everything 
within us. You know, a lot of great 
players talk about just trusting 
the process and doing what you 
know. And that’s what we’re kind 
of working on right now.”
But questions have arisen about 
whether the Wolverines’ style is 

primed to defeat the Pac-12 and 
SEC powerhouses that make up a 
majority of the top-15 teams. With 
college softball slowly shifting to 
power-hitting over consistency, 
Hutchins’ 
long-standing 
(and 
proven) offensive philosophy will 
continue to be challenged.
Michigan trusts her, however, 
and knows that 35 years of 
coaching has brought some tried 
and true methods to Hutchins’ 
name.
“I think we keep to what 
(Hutchins) wants us to do, but 
I think actually, it just kind of 
depends on who she brings in,” 
Uden said. “Obviously when 
(former 
Wolverines 
Sierra 
Romero) and Sierra Lawrence 
stepped out, we became more of 
a consistency team than a power 
hitting, which they’ve adapted 
to that great over the past couple 
of years. We struggled with that, 
I know, my freshman year. But I 
know this year is gonna look a lot 
better.
“We are a more consistent 
team, not so much of a power 
hitting team but who says you 
can’t get the job done with 
consistency?”
If Uden’s point is to hold true, 
the rankings should follow suit.

Michigan gets third straight win

Heading into the final frame, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team trailed Nebraska, 49-48. 
Two tense minutes went by with 
neither side able to find the nylon 
and break the silence.
The 
Cornhuskers 
(5-7 
Big 
Ten, 10-13 overall) spoke first 
with a layup, but the Wolverines 
responded with a free throw from 
senior center Hallie Thome.
Then, more tension followed 
— in the form of over four 
more scoreless minutes — until 
freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
made her way to the line, making 
both shots to tie the game.
Thome soon followed suit, with 
two more from the charity stripe 
to give her team a two-point lead. 
That — coupled with the stellar 
defensive effort that followed — 
was enough to propel Michigan 
(6-6, 15-9) to a 67-61 win Thursday 
night at Crisler Center.
“Before the fourth quarter even 
started, we were all kind of tensed 
up — I think we could feel that,” 
said junior forward Akienreh 
Johnson, who finished with 14 
points and six steals. “So Hallie, 
she brought us in a circle and said 
‘Guys, no matter what happens 
just go out and have fun.’ … So after 
she said that, it kind of just calmed 

us down.”
With less than four minutes 
left in the opening frame and the 
score tied, 8-8, things took a turn 
for Michigan.
Freshman guard Amy Dilk 
made a contested floater but 
landed awkwardly. She collapsed, 
grasping her right knee, and sat 
out the rest of the game. Back 
in high school, Dilk injured that 
same knee two times and had 
surgery.
“She’s gonna get an X-ray 
tomorrow,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico, “and then we’ll 
have more information about her 
tomorrow.”
A 
few 
possessions 
later, 
Nebraska drained a 3-pointer 
to take the lead and build some 
momentum off the Wolverines’ 
misfortune.
But then Hillmon — who 
entered the game when Dilk went 
out — had her say. She notched two 
layups that sparked a 7-0 run for 
her team. Michigan led, 17-13, at 
the end of the quarter.
“She’s my roommate. We’re 
pretty close, so seeing (Dilk) go 
down 
wasn’t 
something 
that 
any of us expected or wanted, of 
course,” Hillmon, who scored a 
team-high 18-points, said. “So that 
was hard for us, but we knew we 
had to adjust in that moment. Amy 
wouldn’t want us to sit around and 

mope and ask her about her knee 
in the middle of the game.”
Within the first 80 seconds 
of the second stanza, Johnson 
notched a triple, two steals and 
a fast break layup. Senior guard 
Nicole Munger also excelled. 
She tallied a jumper and then a 
3-pointer midway through the 
frame to give her team a 10-point 
advantage — its biggest of the half.
The 
Cornhuskers 
battled 
with more pressure on defense 
though, while having their own 
success from beyond the arc. They 
made two 3-pointers that fueled 
a 13-4 run, and at the half, the 
Wolverines’ lead shrunk to three 
points, 35-32.
After 
the 
break, 
things 
remained 
close. 
Michigan 
retained the upper-hand for much 
of the third frame but Nebraska 
kept chipping away. With less 
than three minutes to go in the 
third, the Cornhuskers grabbed 
the lead and soon added some 
security 
with 
another 
triple. 
However, Michigan had the final 
say, squeaking out a win and 
improving its NCAA Tournament 
hopes.
“It feels awesome,” Barnes 
Arico said about winning her third 
consecutive game. “I wish we were 
healthy, but way for everybody else 
to find a way to grind it out and pull 
away a victory tonight.”

Johnson steals show in women’s 
basketball victory over Hawkeyes

With just over two minutes 
remaining in the fourth quarter, 
Nebraska inbounded the ball 
down 
by 
two. 
As 
Hannah 
Whitish tried to push the ball 
up the court, however, Akienreh 
Johnson intercepted the pass and 
sprinted down the floor for a lay-
in that would put the Michigan 
women’s basketball team up by 
four points.
The play was one of the game’s 
biggest moments, and it’s only 
fitting that Johnson was the one 
to initiate it. In the Wolverines’ 
67-61 victory, the junior guard 
scored 14 points on five-for-seven 
shooting, dished out three assists 
and recorded a whopping six 
steals. It was an absolute clinic 
that cemented Johnson’s role 
as one of Michigan’s key pieces 
going forward, especially with 
questions surrounding freshman 
guard Amy Dilk’s availability 
after she suffered a gruesome-
looking injury in the first quarter 
after finishing a layup in traffic.

While 
the 
loss 
of 
Dilk 
appeared to be cause for concern, 
the Wolverines found their spark 
in Johnson, who stole the show 
on the defensive side of the ball.
Johnson picked off a Nebraska 
pass on her first possession of the 
game, making her presence felt 
almost immediately. She then 
opened the second quarter with a 
three from the top of the key and 
proceeded to follow that up with 
two consecutive steals and a layup 
in transition. Her preparation 
in practice and ability to read 
plays on the fly helped her crack 
the 
Cornhuskers’ 
pass-heavy 
offense.
“I knew that they were gonna 
go ball fake and then pass it 
opposite,” Johnson said.
While it was the defensive 
side 
where 
Johnson 
shined 
brightest on Thursday night, 
she provided one of the night’s 
highlight plays on the offensive 
end as well. With six seconds 
left 
in 
the 
second 
quarter, 
Johnson received a pass on the 
right wing from senior forward 
Nicole Munger and proceeded to 

nail a tough fadeaway jumper as 
time expired. It was a shot that 
Johnson practiced routinely. She 
said that Munger trusting her to 
take the shot helped encourage 
her to be aggressive with time 
winding down.
“Her giving the ball to me gave 
me the confidence to take that 
shot,” Johnson said.
After breaking her left hand 
this past fall and missing over 
30 practices, Johnson has been 
slowly working her way back 
to full strength. After showing 
flashes on occasion, Johnson’s 
19-point 
outing 
last 
Friday 
against 
Iowa 
and 
defensive 
showcase 
against 
Nebraska 
on Thursday seemed to finally 
indicate that she is back at full 
strength. Michigan head coach 
Kim Barnes Arico has always 
known that the talent was 
present, and now she’s thrilled 
that the rest of the nation is 
beginning to see it too.
“She’s a kid that can do so 
many things for your team, and I 
think everybody’s starting to see 
that now,” Barnes Arico said.

by nature, is quiet — both by 
the volume of his voice and the 
substance of his words.
On the night of Jan. 22, though, 
after Matthews hit a buzzer-beater 
to pull Michigan over Minnesota in 
a game it had no business winning, 
a throng of media surrounded him 
and, in the most unlikely setting 
possible, he started to divulge.
The Wolverines played poorly 
that night, nearly blowing what 
should have been an easy home 
win thanks to a listless offense, as 
had Matthews himself. Buzzer-
beater aside, seven points on 
3-of-7 shooting and a 76 offensive 
rating, as measured by KenPom, 
wasn’t going to cut it. Neither was 
anything else Michigan did that 
night — the second game in a row 
it hadn’t looked like itself.
Matthews, an internal leader, 
started to explain why.
“I 
told 
the 
team, 
Zavier 
(Simpson) told us as well, we 
kinda gotta loosen up,” he said. 
“We kinda playing kinda tense out 
there. We understand we wanna 
have a perfect season. We wanna 
win, but we still gotta be out there 

playing with smiles on our faces, 
having fun and competing to win 
that.”
It’s 
no 
coincidence 
the 
Wolverines have lost in two 
of 
Matthews’ 
three 
worst 
performances 
by 
offensive 
rating, nor should it surprise 
that their offense has generally 
lagged when he has struggled. 
The reason behind that is simple. 
When Michigan’s offense lags, it 
falls back on Matthews. In turn, 
Matthews falls back on contested 
midrange jump shots, which don’t 
do much for anyone.
That’s why, as the Wolverines 
jumped out to an early lead on as 
part of a 77-65 win over Rutgers 
on Tuesday night, their offense 
humming, 
it 
was 
Matthews 
greasing the skids.
When the Scarlet Knights cut 
the lead to 10 — seeming to weather 
Michigan’s initial onslaught — 
Matthews nailed a three on the 
right wing. Then he came off his 
man to block Geo Baker. Then he 
went to the midrange, nailing a 
fadeaway jumper.
In a half where the Wolverines 
scored 1.43 points per possession, 
that was the only midrange shot 
Matthews took for the first 15 
minutes.
Take what you will from a 

Tuesday in Piscataway. But this is 
what Matthews — and by proxy, 
Michigan’s offense — will look like 
in March if the Wolverines are to 
live up to their potential.
“He’s gotta embrace, just, this 
thing right now,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein on Tuesday. 
“He’s in his fourth year playing 
college 
basketball. 
He’s 
got 
interesting decisions at the end 
of the year. He just needs to do 
exactly what he’s doing today. Just 
go attack. Enjoy every game, take 
the ball to the basket. Shoot the 
open three when you got it. And 
that — those turnaround shots at 
the beginning looked like, ‘Oh my 
god, we’re back at Villanova,’ right? 
The way he started that game.”
Matthews’ defense will buoy 
Michigan on his worst day. As it 
relates to the Wolverines’ ceiling, 
and Matthews’ NBA prospects, all 
that is set in stone.
It’s the rest that’s in question. 
A relatively unassuming 11-point 
performance can provide one hell 
of an answer.
“That’s who he is,” Beilein 
said. “That’s why you saw me. 
I grabbed him and I looked at 
him. I said, ‘That’s who you 
are, Charles. That’s who you 
are. And don’t think anything 
different.’ ”

Tale of the tape: ‘M’ offense 
comes alive against Rutgers 

Rutgers’ plan to upset the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
Tuesday 
appeared 
straightforward: funnel the ball 
inside and scrap for close buckets, 
while packing the lane on defense 
and forcing the Wolverines to hit 
enough jumpers to beat them.
Offensively, the strategy was 
quite successful, as big men 
Eugene Omoruyi, Myles Johnson 
and Shaquille Doorson combined 
for 37 points on 16-for-30 shooting.
Defensively, it was another 
story. Michigan nailed 47 percent 
of its 3-pointers and scored 1.17 
points per possession to hold off 
the Scarlet Knights, 77-66.
Despite not resulting in a win 
for the home team, the gameplan 
was a logical one — and a few days 
ago, it might have even worked. 
Friday night, Iowa overwhelmed 
the Wolverines in the paint, and 
on the other end, sat back in a zone 
to dare them to shoot. Michigan 
obliged, but hit just eight of 33 
treys in a 15-point loss.
What changed?
Knocking down open shots 
was one part of the equation, but 
getting them in the first place 
was just as important. The Daily 
took to the tape to look at what 
went into the Wolverines’ best 
offensive performance in nearly 
a month.
Ignas Brazdeikis gets going:
Per a tweet from The Athletic’s 
Brendan Quinn, when Brazdeikis 
hits his first 3-pointer, he averages 
18.4 points per game on 53 percent 
shooting, as opposed to 13.1 points 
and 41 percent otherwise.
Without knowing why this 
difference exists, any statistic 
like this should be taken with a 
few grains of salt. But it’s still too 
massive to ignore.
Anyway, the freshman forward 
drilled his first shot on Tuesday. 
He finished with 23 points and a 
career-high five 3-pointers. Quite 
the coincidence.
On that possession, he was 
matched up with Omoruyi — his 
former high school teammate — 
on the left wing. It was a simple 
read for Brazdeikis as junior 
center Jon Teske came down to set 
a pick. Omoruyi went underneath 
the screen, deciding he was better 
off taking his chances with a pull-
up three instead of his 240-pound 
frame sticking with the nimbler 
Brazdeikis on the perimeter, as 
well as wanting to take away 
Teske rolling to the hoop.
“They definitely didn’t prepare 
for my 3-point shot, I feel like,” 
Brazdeikis said. “They didn’t 
close out as hard, and they left me 
open.”
Big mistake.
To be fair, it wasn’t as if there 
was a right answer. Throughout 
the game, Brazdeikis sat outside 
looking to dance to the rim, 
waiting for the Scarlet Knight bigs 
to join him. More often than not, 
they couldn’t keep up with the 
rhythm.
Pick-and-pop 
becomes 
deadly:
Last season, the pick-and-pop 
with Moritz Wagner was one 
of Michigan’s offensive staples. 
Against Rutgers, the Wolverines 
utilized it to great effect.
Brazdeikis 
generally 
plays 
the ‘4’ in Michigan’s offense, and 

his combination of slashing and 
outside shooting makes him a 
matchup nightmare, especially 
against a mostly paint-bound 
Scarlet Knights squad. Nowhere 
was this mismatch more evident 
than in the ball screen game.
“What Rutgers does, and this 
is very common, is they’re gonna 
choose to play with two big guys,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“And it’s very difficult for them to 
switch at the four position.”
As a result, Brazdeikis ended 
up with two warmup jumpers 
midway through the second half.
Omoruyi wasn’t quite quick 
enough, or in position, to be able 
to close out effectively on either. 
The next time the Wolverines 
tried the pick-and-pop, Omoruyi 
closed out, and junior point guard 
Zavier Simpson blew past him for 
a layup.
“I thought we played well in 
the second half, but you can’t 
get yourself in a hole against 
a team ranked in the top five,” 
said Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell. 
“Every time we made a mistake 
on the defensive end, they made 
us pay.”
That was one of those mistakes, 
as Geo Baker did himself no favors 
by completely giving up on the play 
— though that may have stemmed 
from 
a 
miscommunication 
between 
him 
and 
Omoruyi, 
whose closeout on Brazdeikis was 
far too late. But the main point of 
the previous play is to show the 
dilemma that the Scarlet Knights 
faced in defending this action.
Simpson — who finished with 14 
points, seven rebounds and seven 
assists — has been elite at making 
plays when getting downhill, 
either from finding the open man 
off the pick-and-roll and pick-and-
pop or with his signature hook 
shot. Rutgers decided that taking 
away Simpson’s penetration was 
the smartest strategy in defending 
the ball screen, giving up multiple 
wide-open looks in the process. 
That’s the luxury of having one of 
the country’s most unique players; 
a barely 6-foot-tall point guard 
who’s also an elite finisher.
Charles Matthews blows the 
game open:
For about five minutes, the 
redshirt junior wing was the best 
player on the court.
With 15:22 to play in the first 
half, he took advantage of some 
poor scouting. Matthews prefers 
to drive towards the baseline off 
the side pick-and-roll, but Montez 
Mathis forgot this momentarily 
as Matthews shook him with a 
slight hesitation to the right. No 
Scarlet Knight was close to being 
in position to cut off his drive.
Matthews’ jumper has come 
and gone this season, but he 
knocked down two free throws 
after drawing a foul on a baseline 
inbounds play two minutes later. 
On Michigan’s next possession, 
he stepped into, and swished, a 
confident 3-pointer.
By 
that 
time, 
Matthews’ 
teammates had sensed he was 
feeling it, and cleared entirely 
out of the way for him to attempt 
one of his favorite shots, a 14-foot 
turnaround that’s as unblockable 
as it is inconsistent. This time, it 
dropped in.
Matthews scored just two 
points the rest of the way, but his 
dominating stretch turned out to 
be critical. After the Wolverines 

took a 17-point lead nine minutes 
into 
the 
first 
half, 
Rutgers 
outscored them 55-50.
Michigan finds success in 
transition:
“Sometimes, fast break, we 
shouldn’t even do it,” Beilein said 
after Michigan beat Minnesota on 
Jan. 22. “Because we’re jogging 
up the court. We gotta sprint. We 
don’t run. … You end up getting 
scores in the 50s and 60s if you’re 
not willing to bust your butt to get 
up the court.”
Against the Scarlet Knights, 
the Wolverines not only sprinted 
in transition, but showed strong 
positioning and patience when 
they were unable to get a bucket 
immediately.
Often, it started with — who 
else? — Simpson. Off a long 
rebound three minutes into the 
game, he was decisive but steady 
in pushing the ball up the court, 
his penetration drawing Omoruyi 
to help under the basket. The 
product was an easy corner trey, 
as Simpson fired the bounce pass 
to Brazdeikis at exactly the right 
time.
A 
minute 
later, 
another 
Simpson rebound led to fast-
break points. Before the rebound 
even landed in Simpson’s hands, 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
was off and running. Poole’s 
recognition 
put 
him 
behind 
the entire Rutgers defense, and 
Simpson hit him in stride.
Michigan’s 
best 
possession 
of the game, coming with seven 
minutes left in the first half, 
wasn’t a fast break. But its roots 
stemmed from transition, where 
Brazdeikis steamed up the middle 
in anticipation of a breakout. 
Meanwhile, Poole spaced the play 
well near the left wing.
While the Scarlet Knights got 
back to defend the fast break, part 
of successful transition offense is 
the ability to know when to run 
and when to pull out and set up 
the halfcourt attack. Simpson 
saw he didn’t have an immediate 
play and didn’t force the issue, 
and from there, dribble-drive 
penetration, a smart cut by 
Matthews and unselfish passing 
led to three points.
Early in the second half, the 
Wolverines’ 
transition 
attack 
exhibited more good spacing, as 
Simpson ran in his lane and forced 
Baker to stay on him. Brazdeikis 
fired a pass to Matthews, who 
simply beat everyone down the 
court. The pass was inch-perfect, 
right over Baker’s fingertips, but 
without Simpson sprinting out 
wide, Baker would have been able 
to play free safety and come up 
with a likely steal.
Six minutes into the second 
half, Simpson pushed the ball hard 
up the court and forced Rutgers to 
surge downcourt ahead of him. 
The Scarlet Knights were rightly 
occupied with stopping Simpson, 
but failed to notice Poole, the 
Wolverines’ best shooter, as the 
trailer. The result was a wide-
open triple.
Notice a common denominator 
in all of these plays yet?
“Fourteen, seven and seven. 
That’s incredible,” Beilein said 
after the game, reciting Simpson’s 
stat line. “We’ve been really 
blessed. It’s probably why we’ve 
had any success we’ve had is that 
we have really good point guards. 
... The point guards make it go.”

Despite familiarity of MSU, Boka 
found connection at Michigan

When Nick Boka jumped into 
a brawl against Michigan State 
in the Great Lakes Invitational, 
it wasn’t the first time that the 
senior bled for the Michigan 
hockey team.
From the time he could pick 
up a stick, Boka wanted to be 
a Wolverine. And both of his 
grandparents 
were 
fervent 
Michigan hockey fans. Many 
years back at a Michigan game, 
Boka was playing mini-sticks in 
the halls behind the bleachers at 
Yost Ice Arena.
As he lunged forward with 
his stick, Boka crashed into a 
picture frame on the wall and 
shattered his stick. But after a 
team employee picked glass out 
of his hair for the rest of the 
game, he left the arena that night 
not only happy but with a Red 
Berenson-signed stick to replace 
his old one.
“I don’t remember much of it 
but I still have that signed stick 
with me,” Boka said. “It’s pretty 
special.”
After four years on the blue 
line for the Wolverines, it’s 
hard to imagine him wearing 
anything 
other 
than a Michigan 
sweater. 
But 
when Boka first 
started 
getting 
recruited, 
he 
initially 
turned 
to the Spartans. 
Though 
Michigan 
was 
the defenseman’s 
preferred 
destination, 
he 
didn’t get an offer right away.
Boka’s former coach with 
the Detroit-based Honeybaked 
hockey program, Tom Anastos, 
was the Spartans’ head coach at 
the time, giving him the same 
chance to latch on to something 
comfortable that he would have 
had with the Wolverines. Though 
Michigan State went a middling 
30-34-11 in Anastos’ first two 
seasons at the helm, it was 

enough for Boka, who committed 
to play in East Lansing during his 
freshman year of high school.
“At the time, Tom was the 
coach at State when I was going 
through the recruiting process,” 
Boka said. “... It just felt like the 
right move at the right time.”
In 
time, 
however, 
Boka 
began to feel differently. While 
Michigan spent the better part 
of 
a 
quarter-
century skating 
its 
way 
to 
Frozen 
Fours, 
Michigan 
State 
only made the 
tournament once 
in the six years 
prior to Boka’s 
commitment. 
The 
Spartans 
had his old coach, 
old players he 
played against and even some of 
his old teammates, but the even 
more familiar allure of Michigan 
beckoned. Without even being 
committed for a full year, he 
decommitted.
Once Boka’s choice became 
public, 
Wolverines 
assistant 
coach Brian Wiseman knew that 
Boka wanted to be a Wolverine 
and brought him to Ann Arbor. 
When Boka saw Berenson, the 

coach remembered the signed 
stick that he gave Boka, and his 
conversation 
with 
Wiseman 
sealed the deal.
“I decommitted on my own 
because, as I said it never 
felt right,” Boka said. “On my 
recruiting visit, (Wiseman) knew 
I wanted to be a Wolverine and 
wanted to come here. Michigan 
was the first school I visited after 
I decommitted, and I committed 
right away.
“Luckily for me, Wiseman 
spoke to me at the right time. 
(Michigan State) never felt right 
to me, it never felt right in my 
heart. He said there’s always a 
spot for me at Michigan. So I’m 
pretty thankful for him and for 
the opportunity to play here. I 
couldn’t be happier with how it 
all turned out.”
Those former junior hockey 
teammates and familiar faces 
from East Lansing? They’re 
anything but that now. Boka 
himself admits that when the two 
in-state rivals meet on Friday in 
Ann Arbor and Saturday in the 
“Duel in the D”, there won’t be 
any love lost between the two 
rivals.
For familiarity’s sake, both he 
and Michigan wouldn’t have it 
any other way.
