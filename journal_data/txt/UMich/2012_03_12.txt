CNN correspondent,
'U' alum will give
address at April 28

Daily News Editor
Nearly two decades after he
graduated from the University's
medical school, Sanjay Gupta will
return to his home state to deliver
this year's Spring Commence-
ment speech on April 28 at the Big
House.
Gupta, a native of Novi, current-
ly serves as CNN's chief medical
correspondent, where he contrib-
utes to various CNN shows and is
the anchor of the self-titled show,
"Sanjay Gupta M.D.," which airs on
weekends. He is also a practicing
neurosurgeon at Grady Memorial
Hospital in Atlanta and authored
two books about medicine, and his
first novel will be released tomor-
row.

In an exclusive interview with
The Michigan Daily on Friday,
University
President Mary Michigan Daily
Sue Coleman EXCLUSIVE
said Gupta
serves as an
influential
example
of what
graduates
can aspire to
become.
"We cNN
thought he,
so represents Michigan alums and
the impact that they can have on
the world," Coleman said. "In so
many areas, he has really become a
spokesperson who has tremendous
influence in the country soI think
for young people he really does
represent a terrific role model."
Gupta was on vacation last
weekend and unable to be reached
for comment, according to his
assistant.
Gupta started school at the Uni-

Michigan will take on Ohio,
the MAC Tournament champi-
ons, in Nashville in the second
round on Friday. Should the
Wolverines top the Bobcats, a
third round match-up looms
with the winner of the game
between No. 5 seed Temple
and either California or South
Florida (the Golden Bears and
Bulls play each other in the
first round on Wednesday in
Dayton, Ohio).
"(It was) less nerve-wrack-
ing," senior guard Zack Novak

said of watching the bracket
unveiled this season compared
to last year. "(I was) more con-
cerned about matchups this
time, looking who you're going
to play.
"If you would've asked me
lastyear after we got in, I'd had
no idea what seed we were, no
idea where we were going or
really even who we were play-
ing.... This year, we just saw it,
and you're waiting to see who
you drew."

SHEI fashion

More than $1,500
raised for women's

Daily StaffReporter
Sava's State Street Cafe clientele
transitioned from a crowd of hun-
gry customers to sartorial enthusi-
asts on Saturday night after being
transformed into a runway for a
fashion show charity event.
As part of women's history
month, student organizers at SHRI
Magazine collaborated with the
co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi
Omega to develop the program,
which garnered more than $1,500
in proceeds for the Women's Cen-
ter of Southeastern Michigan, an
organization that provides a num-
ber of services for women, includ-
ing job counseling and divorce
support.
LSA senior Inga Shoberg, SHEI

theme was parallel with the values
and goals of the Women's Center,
which supports women who have
suffered from domestic violence
as part of its many services. Sho-

on Saturday, Democrats from
. across the state endorsed a
host of candidates for a vari-
ety of offices. State law for-
bids parties from awarding
nominations before their offi-
cial convention in the fall, but
these unofficial endorsements
carry the same weight in that
candidates will be the only
ones to stand for nomination at
the convention.
The Democrats also
endorsed Southfield District
Court Judge Shelia Johnson,
Wayne County Circuit Court
Judge Connie Marie Kel-
ley and University of Michi-
gan Law Prof. Bridget Mary
McCormack in their bids for
the Michigan Supreme Court.
Endorsements were also given
to nominees for the Michi-
gan State University Board of
Trustees and Wayne State Uni-

her.
"My intention from the
beginning was to change the
way my party thinks about
these types of nominations,"
Bernstein said. "In doing so, it
was my goal to treat this posi-
tion with the seriousness that I
think it deserves."
Bernstein said his main pri-
orities, if elected to the board,
would be to keep the Univer-
sity affordable and maintain
its status as a public university.
"You can have the most
exceptional product in the
world, but if nobody can afford
it, it's frivolous," Bernstein
said. "On the other side, you
can have the most affordable
product in the world, but not
worth buying, it doesn't matter
how cheap it is."

Legislators
emphasize
importance of
youth vote
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
In the 2008 presidential
election, the youth vote played
a record role in the election
of President Barack Obama.
With the 2012 election just
months away, campus orga-
nizations from an array of
diverse backgrounds are laud-
ing the importance of student
involvement in the campaign.

About 40 students from the
University of Michigan and
Eastern Michigan University
attended a rally in Angell Hall
Friday evening that included
speeches from Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), U.S. Rep. Hansen
Clarke (D-Mich.), state Rep.
Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor)
and state Rep. Fred Durhal
Jr. (D-Detroit). The Univer-
sity's chapter of the National
Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People and
the Central Student Govern-
ment's Voice Your Vote Com-
mission co-hosted the event,
which centered on encourag-
ing political activism among
high school and college stu-
dents.

Levin, who spoke first,
emphasized the importance
for students to be politically
active and participate in the
voting process, especially to
bolster the liberal vote fol-
lowing the Republican surge
to take control of Congress in
2010.
In an interview after his
speech, Levin said even on
issues of higher education,
students are often unable to
grasp the effect of politics on
their daily lives.
"Young people frequently
don't understand what the
difference is, what difference
it makes whether they vote or
not," Levin said.

MADISON TOWNSHIP, Mich.
State to reduce
armed patrols
The Michigan Department of
Corrections is reducing armed
patrols driving around the Gus
Harrison prison and 26 others in
a move to save $13.2 million a year.
Department spokesman Russ
Marlan tells The Daily Telegram
in Adrian that the change takes
effect April 1. Gus Harrison is
in Lenawee County's Madison
Township, about 60 miles south-
west of Detroit.
Marlan says the prisons now
have armed perimeter patrols
around the clock and will use ran-
dom patrols instead.
The Michigan Corrections
Organization represents about
7,000 corrections officers and
says the patrols are essential to
prison safety.

the state capital of Olympia, Grays
Harbor County Undersheriff Rick

enforcement officers had joined
the manhunt for him.
BALANDI, Afghanistan
Army sergeant
kills 16 Afghanis
Moving from house to house,
a U.S. Army sergeant opened fire
yesterday on Afghan villagers
as they slept, killing 16 people -
mostly women and children - in
anattackthat reignited fury atthe
U.S. presence following a wave of
deadly protests over Americans
burning Qurans.
The attack threatened the
deepesthreach yet in U.S.-Afghan
relations, raising questions both
in Washington and Kabul about
why American troops are still
fighting in Afghanistan after 10
years of conflict and the killing of
Osama bin Laden.
The slayings, the worst atroc-
ity committed by U.S. forces dur-
ing the Afghan war, came amid
deepening public outrage spurred
by last month's Quran burnings
and an earlier video purportedly
" showing American Marines uri-
nating on dead Taliban militants.

MEXICO CITY
At least 50-year-
old remains found
in Mexican cave
Mexican authorities have
found the remains of 167 people
in a southern Mexican cave,
and forensic experts believe the
remains are at least 50 years old,
according to a statement from
Chiapas state prosecutors.
The statement released Satur-
day said the remains were found
Friday on the Nuevo Ojo de Agua
ranch in an area frequently used
by Central American migrants
traveling north. The statement
said there were no visible signs
of violence on the remains, which
"break easily."
The statement said authorities
will "not discard any line of inves-
tigation."
Mass graves have been found
in the past two years mainly in
northern Mexico containing the
bodies of dozens of migrants and
others allegedly killed by drug
cartels.

Levin said high school and
college students played an
unprecedented role in elect-
ing Obama four years ago. He
compared student support for
Obama to that of former Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, noting
that youth support for Kenne-
dy - which was visible at his
famous Peace Corps speech on
the steps of the Michigan Union
in 1960 - was likely surpassed
by Obama's 2008 campaign.
"You can't duplicate that; you
can't do that every election,"
Levin said. "But you can protect
what's important, and that's
what I believe the energy the
Obama program makes a differ-
ence in."
Durhal, who is also chair of
the Michigan Legislative Black
Caucus, said when there is a low
voter turnout, elections fail to
effectively represent the opin-
ions of all Americans.
"The minority of folk are
determining who the majority
of leaders are," Durhal said. "A
small number (is) making the
decision for the mass number."
Durhal said it's important
that people of diverse back-
grounds participate in the polit-
ical process.
"All (backgrounds) have to be
fairly represented," Durhal said.
"And it cannot happen when
you stay home and don't partici-
pate."
Irwin emphasized to stu-
dents the importance of each
and every vote, providing the
example of the 2010 election of
University alum Yousef Rabhi,
who won his seat on the Washt-
enaw County Board of Commis-
sioners by two votes.
Irwin stressed that students
should voice their opinions to
their elected officials, particu-
larly issues that directly impact
them like the recent debate over
whether the University's gradu-
ate student research assistants
should be able to unionize.
"We want to hear from you,"
Irwin said. "We want to hear
from students at the University
of Michigan."
Clarke similarly urged stu-
dents to voice their opinions

which Shoberg said is to assert
that the term "wife beater" for

against rising student debt.
"There are some people who
have been paying their stu-
dent loans for 10, 20, 30 years,"
Clarke said.
On Thursday, Clarke intro-
duced H.R. 4170, the Student
Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012,
which states that if student loan
recipients make payments equal
to 10 percent of their discretion-
ary income for a period of 10
years, the remaining balance of
their federal student loan debt
will be forgiven.
"It's time for Congress to
stand for the rights of student
loan borrowers," Clarke said
in a speech on the House floor
Thursday. "It's time to forgive
these student loan debts."
Debbie Dingell, wife of Con-
gressman John Dingell and a
prominent political figure in the
state, also attended the event.
In an interview after the rally,
Dingell said issues such as jobs,
education and health care are
especially important to young
adults and they should play an
active role in determining pol-
icy.
"All those decisions are being
made, and young people need
to be involved," Dingell said.
"They're a very important part
of our population, and you can
make or break and make the dif-
ference in an election."
Dingell said the power of
campus groups such as the Uni-
versity's chapter of the NAACP
to mobilize students to vote
and become politically active is
an important aspect of student
civic involvement.
"This is a community," Ding-
ell said. "It's knowing that
you're a part, it's individual-to-
individual contact, it's under-
standing what your interests as
a community are and exercising
that. We need to be seeing this
across campus, and the women
need to talk about what the
issues are. (We're) organized by
different interests, but people
with common interests should
be organizing, talking about
how they make a difference."
Janee Brown, president of the
University's chapter of NAACP,
told students at the event that
they need to hold their repre-
sentatives accountable for cuts
to financial aid that have taken
it's a really great cause because
it's a creative way to help out ...
and become aware of different
problems going on," Pinkha-
sova said.
Kim Cumming, executive
director of The Women's Cen-
ter of Southern Michigan, was
also at the event. Cumming
said she was honored at how
hard the two organizations
worked to benefit the Women's
Center.
"It's inspiring to see a young
group of folks who are so com-
mitted to women's causes and
to being philanthropic, and
I know what an enormous
amount of work it takes to put
on an event," Cumming said.
"We're just grateful. As a small
grassroots nonprofit, to have
somebody else hosting a fun-

place at the state and federal
levels.
"Your way of affecting your
education is by voting for dif-
ferent officials who are actually
making a difference," Brown
said.
Todd Flynn, chair of Central
Student Government's Voice
Your Vote Commission, said
political apathy on campus is
the leading reason to why stu-
dents at the University do not
vote.
"We think that a lot of that
apathy comes from a lack of
information," Flynn said. "Stu-
dents don't understand how
they're affected by decisions
made in seemingly faraway
places by people they haven't
met."
Lauren Coffman, commu-
nications chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of the College
Democrats, stressed that in
light of recent policy propos-
als by Republicans that would
restrict access to birth control
and presidential hopeful Rick
Santorum's criticism of Obama's
college accessibility efforts, it's
crucially important for Ameri-
ca's youth to speak up.
"Tell (politicians) that as
a woman, you're not going to
stand by while there are attacks
going on with your right to
health care and your right to
contraception," Coffman said.
"Tell them that as a student,
you're not going to allow politi-
cians to tell you that it's elitist
to think that everyone has the
same right to education that
you have here at the University.
And tell them that when a presi-
dential candidate says that we
should let our schools go bank-
rupt, that as a Michigander and
a Wolverine, you're not going to
stand for that."
CSG President DeAndree
Watson said the Voice Your Vote
Commission is working to edu-
cate students on the importance
of the student vote.
"It's important for us to vote
because, if we need anything
changed in the state, even in
this country, it's going to hap-
pen through us collectively
voting and making sure we are
putting people in office who
reflect our values and will work
on our behalf," Watson said.
draiser for us is an incredible
gift."
LSA freshman Claire Scho-
rin said she attended the event
to show her support for the
Women's Center and to help
raise awareness against domes-
tic violence.
"I thought the event was
really cool," Schorin said. "It
was cool that they focused on
hair and makeup and not just
clothes because it's a whole
other element of fashion ... it
was definitely a cool concept."
Nursing junior Emily Ruim-
veld said she was impressed by
the appearance of the models at
the event.
"The hair and makeup is
amazing," Ruimveld said. "It's
just phenomenal. And it's for a
great cause so it's really cool."

versity as an undergraduate in
1986, and then continued on to
the University's Medical School,
specializing in neurosurgery
through Inteflex - a program
no longer offered at the Univer-
sity that granted high-school
students admission to the Uni-
versity for their undergraduate
studies and medical school.
At the request of medical
school students, Gupta returned
to the medical school in 2009
to deliver their commencement
speech. Medical School Dean
James Woolliscroft said he
was pleased with Gupta's 2009
address, and expects Gupta's
upcoming commencement
speech to showcase his commit-
ment to humanity.
"He did asuperb job then, and
I fully expect he'll do a superb
job for commencement this
spring as well," Woolliscroft
said.
Woolliscroft said he remem-
bers Gupta's impressive aca-
demic work as a student.
"He certainly was very, very
capable," Wooliscroft said. "He
excelled as a medical student,
and he also excelled as a neuro-
surgical resident. He has a very
broad interest for many years
going back to the time of train-
ing."
In addition to giving the key-
note address, Gupta will receive
a Doctorate of Humane Letters.
Susan Orlean, a University
alum, novelist and writer for
The New Yorker, has accepted
an invitation to be the speaker at
the University Graduate Exer-
cises on April 27 in Hill Audito-
rium, and she will also receive a
Doctorate of Humane Letters.
Coleman said she expects the
student reaction to these speak-
ers to be positive because of
their status as University alums.
"I think the fact that they're
both well-known, accomplished
and from us (will make people)
have a lot of pride," Coleman
said.
Gupta was nominated to the
University's Honorary Degree
Committee, a group designated
to select recipients of Univer-
sity Honorary Degrees, last year
and was added to the list of pos-
sible recipients nominated every
winter and spring when selec-
tions are made. The committee
and the University's Board of
Regents must approve Gupta,
along with the other honor-

ary degree recipients, at their
monthly nieeting this Thursday.
"We try to balance interests,
we try to balance areas across
the University ... so that we give
students a chance to see this
broad spectrum of accomplish-
ments," Coleman said.
Four additional honorary
degree recommendations will
be recommended atthe meeting,
including Josd Antonio Abreu, J.
Ira Harris, Richard Sarns and
Chris Van Allsburg. Coleman
said she is excited for this year's
recipients, calling them a "great
fleet."
Additionally, Coleman is
recommending University
alum Chris Van Allsburg, the
author of "Jumanji" and "The
Polar Express," for a Doctor of
Humane Letters.
Van Allsburg has won the
CaldecottMedal, anawardgiven
annually to the author of an
exceptional children's picture
book in America by the Associa-
tion for Library Service to Chil-
dren, in 1982 for "Jumanji" and
1986 for "The Polar Express,"
according to the ALSC website.
Both children's books have been
turned into major motion pic-
tures.
A Venezuelan musician and
educator who completed some
of his graduate work at the Uni-
versity, Abreu is the founder
of El Sistema, a youth program
that teaches music to under-
privileged children, and he
will receive a Doctor of Music
degree.
"He uses the string education
to bring young people out of pov-
erty and hundreds of thousands
of young people in Venezuela are
part of these orchestras," Cole-
man said. "I think that's going to
be just a terrific (thing) to bring
him and honor him for what he's
done in the world."
Harris, a University alum
who served on the University's
Investment Advisory Commit-
tee will be awarded a Doctor of
Laws degree. Harris, a notable
figure in the financial world
serves as the chairman of the
recently established consulting
firm J. I. Harris & Associates.
Richard Sarns, a biomedi-
cal engineer and inventor who
hails from Ann Arbor, will be
given a Doctor of Engineering
at Thursday's meeting. Sarns
collaborated with doctors at the
University Hospital to develop
the Sarns machine, a device
used during open-heart surgery
which is now used around the
world.

Stamp out smoking
Education, advocacy can stop tobacco epidemic
ver the past 20 years, youth smoking prevention has been
one of America's success stories. Across the country,
young people are taught smoking is unhealthy. But the
war against smoking is not over. According to the Surgeon Gen-
eral, 3,800 youth under the age of 18 smoke their first cigarette each
day. Youth smoking has recently become an epidemic and instead of
focusing on blame, the country needs to focus on tobacco use pre-
vention in the most effective ways possible.

From Russia with love

VYTEGRA, Russia -
While many of my peers
flocked south to get their
tan on this spring break,
I spent my time
in provincial
northwestern
Russia - a part
of the world not
often considered
a springtime ,
hotspot, and
rightly so. After
all, the weather DANIEL
in northern Rus- CHARDELL
sia this time of
year makes our
Michigan winters seem mildly cool
at worst.
A subzero temperature was just
one of many expectations that I
entertained as I set out for Russia.
Organized through the Univer-
sity's Center for Global and Intercul-
tural Study, the 10-day alternative
spring break excursion was intended
to give participants (about a dozen
undergrads, myself included) the
opportunity to experience the Rus-
sian provinces firsthand and to
witness the ambiguities that com-
prise Russian national identity -
the ambiguous position between
the European West and the Asian
East, between the status of former
superpower and a nation in decline,
between the urban modernity of
Moscow and St. Petersburg and the
rural backwardness of, well, just
about everywhere else.
The roads outside the city were
rough. We quickly found that the
bustling metropolis that is St.
Petersburg is the exception and that
miles upon miles of wilderness are
the norm.
You can't truly grasp the sheer
vastness of Russia until you spend
a day sitting in a chartered bus, tee-
tering along some long-neglected
highway, watching the breathtaking
landscape uniformly covered with
snow pass by outside your window
for hours on end. It was stark, but it
was beautiful.
This was where we spent most of
our time - in the towns and villages
located hours away from the Euro-
peanized St. Petersburg. This, some
would tell you, is the real Russia.
In addition to volunteer work in
local museums and public schools,

I was to conduct an independent
research project on provincial
attitudes toward the federal gov-
ernment and the then-ongoing pres-
idential election (obvious spoiler
alert: Putin won).
I planned on conducting inter-
views with local administrators
and townspeople, gathering some
information on the campaign and
then continuing on my way. But the
people whom I encountered on the
ground changed my outlook entirely.
In all of the villages, I was over-
whelmed by the generosity of the
individuals we met, young and old.
Local businesspeople enthusiasti-
cally sat down to speak with us.
Local officials were eager to dis-
cuss their new initiatives. Teachers
were thrilled to have native English
speakers visit their students. The
children were especially kind. As
we departed, they humbly handed
us small gifts - pictures they drew,
letters they wrote and crafts they
made. Some gave us their most
prized possessions, which they
insisted that we, their new Ameri-
can friends, take home as a reminder
of our new friendships.
In one memorable moment, an
older high school student asked me
what I thought about the U.S. mili-
tary. I told her that I believe in sup-
porting American troops, butI don't
believe in many of the wars that we
fight. She smiled, telling me in bro-
ken English that she agreed. She dis-
liked the American interventions in
the Middle East, but she didn't hold
my government's actions against me.
These kids deserve better. Their
schools are underfunded, opportu-
nities for employment are decreas-
ing and the government makes
sacrifices at the expense of young
people as opportunistic politicians
consolidate their own power.
I went to Russia with Putin, poli-
tics and protests on my mind. I left
10 days later thinking only of the
friendly students we'd met, the lives
they lead and the uncertain future
they face.
Putin's preordained victory
seemed insignificant in light of what
I'd seen. My research project seemed
trivial. I caught only a glimpse of
provincial northwestern Russia, but
I saw enough to know that there are
more important things - real issues

affecting real people - than a sham
of an election. Politics mean a lot, but
they aren't everything.
In political conversation, it's con-
venient to make blanket statements
- to say, for example, "the Russians"
when you really mean Putin, "the
Iranians" when you really mean
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
and "the Israelis" when you really
mean Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his majority Likud
Party. It's easy to forget that these
individuals don't necessarily speak
for all those under their author-
ity and that there is human depth
beyond the statements of the most
prominent few among them.
Behind the
generalizations
are diverse
opinions.
Whenyouhear talk of an abstract
"Russia" impeding the passage
of a UN Security Council resolu-
tion condemning the bloodshed in
Syria, know that this action rep-
resents the will and interests of an
infinitesimal fraction of individu-
als who occupy positions of power.
Their decisions do not mirror the
character of a single, cohesive Rus-
sian people. As in any country, pure
national solidarity does not exist.
Just as Americans would resent
outsiders presuming that there is
consensus among us and that we
passively support all government
policies and wars being waged, it's
worth bearing in mind that such
statements make complex realities
unrealistically simple.
Look past the obvious. Behind the
impossible generalizations, there
are millions of diverse opinions.
Behind the smokescreen, there are
innocent children for whom politi-
cal theater means little. Behind the
politics, there are very good, very
real people.

The Surgeon General released the latest
report on tobacco use last Thursday. Statistics
show that while the rate of youth smokers has
decreased, there is still a significant problem.
According to the report, 19.5 percent of high
school students are smokers - down from
the 27.5 percent reported in 1994. While the
improvement is good, it can be better. Of the
3,800 youth who smoke their first cigarette
each day, more than 1,000 of them become
daily users.
Smoking has huge economic costs to the
United States. According to the World Health
Organization, the main cost of smoking
comew from healthcare costs and loss of pro-
duction from smokers who aren't ableto work.
Treating lung, tongue, jaw and throat cancer
for dying smokers costs a lot of money, and
sometimes that money comes from taxpayers.
Smokers who are in the hospital or unable to
work are not contributing to society. Compa-
nies must find replacements or hire additional
workers, all at higher costs. Smoking preven-
tion is important to decrease these strains on
the economy.
In the past, educational smoking preven-
tion has worked well. The U.S. prides itself
on the degree to which smoking is discussed.
Schools and families have taken on the job
of educating the young about the dangers
of smoking. Programs such as Drug Abuse
Resistance Education support these goals and

help lower the amount of kids smoking. While
educational prevention must continue, there
are other options to consider. In Australia,
the government has passed a law stating that
in Dec. 2012, all cigarette boxes will be plain
green with health warnings covering the back
and the front. Brand names will only be print-
ed on the front, and logos or trademarks will
not be allowed. Australia is allowing market
forces to stop the sale of cigarettes. Lack of
advertisement on the boxes should discour-
age newcomers from buying them. Australia's
plan is cost effective and will effectively deter
people from purchasing cigarettes.
With the Surgeon General's announcement
that smoking needs to be stopped, the U.S.
should also stop its exportation of tobacco
products. The U.S. is the biggest exporter
of cigarettes to developing countries in the
world. It's hypocritical to put time and money
into decreasing smoking in the U.S. while
shipping the deadly substance to poorer coun-
tries. The U.S. should work to stop smoking all
over the world, not just at home.
While the U.S. had one of the most effec-
tive smoking prevention programs in the
world, our progress has stalled in the past
10 years. Smoking is a strain on the economy
and is bad for society. The U.S. should look
for more effective ways to end youth smoking
by following the lead of other countries and
increasing educational programs.

KYLE SMITH I
Focus on jobs, not re-election

Negative campaigning has been a hallmark
of politicalraces throughout history, with some
of the most well-documented cases coming
from various American presidential elections.
Colloquially referred to as "mudslinging,"
negative campaigning involves emphasizing
your opponents' negative characteristics and
weaknesses, rather than focusing on your own
positives and the serious issues at hand. In its
worst form, negative campaigning can involve
character defamation, slandering and even at
times racially primed political rhetoric - just
ask Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and
John Quincy Adams.
In less than two weeks, students will cast
their votes in the most hotly contested and
competitive election in the recent history
of the Central Student Government at the
University of Michigan. With so many stake-
holders and candidates, it's easy for a few to
forget the values of integrity and fair play,
and indulge in mudslinging to gain political
dividends.
As the only independent candidates con-
testing the CSG presidency and vice presi-
dency, we, Manish Parikh and Omar Hashwi,
pledge we will not engage in mudslinging -
we will focus on the issues at hand. On our
part we will champion issues that the stu-
dents truly care about: A 24-hour cafe, cal-
endar reform, more concerts on campus and
greater engagement through social media.
Most importantly we will fight for what the
students truly want.
But in pursuingthis fight, and a victory, far
from criticizing and condemning our oppo-
nents,we salute them all. We had the pleasure
of interacting with each of them yesterday,
and would like to take this opportunity to
praise rather than criticize them:
To the Defend Affirmative Action Party, we
salute that you have made one single issue the
focus of your political party. It's commend-
able that you have always remained true to
this issue, and that each of you are contesting
this election because of a belief in this issue,
rather than political power.
To Shreya Singh, and YouMich: we had the

pleasure of making your acquaintance and
were humbled by your kindness and warmth.
The fact that you have involved so many
minorities in your party is commendable.
To our friends at the Students For Puppies
party, we can only say that we all love pup-
pies, that it would be great to have more pup-
pies on campus and that love for puppies and
other animals,with a disdain for cruelty to all
animals, is a noble cause - we hope you will
champion the latter.
To MForward, and Aditya Sathi, I congratu-
late you on winning the presidential nomina-
tion of MForward - no easy feat - and the
various issues you have tried solving over the
past few years.
Finally, to the newly formed OurMichigan
party, the cause you support, the Coalition
for Tuition Equality, is a noble one; we com-
mend you for championing the rights of the
less fortunate in society.
Which leaves us with... us. We sincerely
hope that you, the students, will give us your
vote come election day. Manish Parikh and
Omar Hashwi will nt wear suits and ties -
this is not the U.S. pi.sidential election - we
will not make tall and empty promises, we
will not work for our resumes and we will not
put any one before our students.
We are running as independents, because
we are not and never will be politicians. Man-
ish wants to become a social entrepreneur
someday, and Omar wants to become a doctor
and save lives. Simply put, we're candidates
who like to focus on the issues outlined in
our platform rather than the skeletons in our
opponents' closets.
We hope thatour opponents will follow our
lead in fair play and good conduct, and that
they will pledge to avoid slander and negative
campaigning at all costs. We love Jefferson,
but we'd like to refrain from his style of cam-
paigning by saluting our adversaries, and ask-
ing them to keep it classy.
Manish Parikh is a Businessjunior and CSG
presidential candidate, Omar Hashwi is an LSA
sophomore and CSG vice-presidential candidate.

Recently, campaign politics have unfortunately seemed
to take priority over job creation for President Barack
Obama. The president announced just several weeks ago
that he would not allow the construction of the Keystone
Pipeline Project, a transnational oil pipeline that would
have created more than 20,000 jobs and reduced our reli-
ance on oil from politically unstable nations. Even after
several local and state officials approved the project and
lobbied hard on its behalf, the president refused because
he didn't want to anger the special interest environmen-
tal groups that support him.
The Keystone XL Pipeline is a venture by the energy
company TransCanada to create a 1,700-mile pipeline
connecting an oil rich region of Alberta, Canada to U.S.
refineries in Texas. This projectis ahands-down win-win,
both creating badly needed construction jobs throughout
the Great Plains and providing the United States with
a greater percentage of oil from our northern neighbor.
In terms of job creation, this project is the definition of
"shovel-ready," with 20,000 jobs created almost immedi-
ately after the president signs the approval papers.
Upon completion of the project, analysts have specu-
lated that 700,000 new barrels of oil per day would flow
into the United States from Canada instead of being
shipped by tanker from the Middle East or Venezuela. In
the long term, BusinessWeek estimated that the pipeline
would have created an additional 500,000 U.S. jobs by
2035. However, because the president has denied con-
struction permits, those jobs will now likely end up in
Asia, as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is now
looking to China asa customer for this energy.
Obama initially delayed making a decision on the Key-
stone Project until 2013, asking for another environmen-
tal review that would conveniently conclude right after
the presidential elections. The Obama administration
has a history of delaying important policy until 2013.
Both the execution of Obamacare and the raising of the
debt ceiling are other important issues that the president
had attempted to punt past November in order to escape
the political consequences of poor policy. This time, the
president decided to play campaign politics again, costing
America 20,000 jobs, claiming the environmental conse-
quences were too great.
Obama's denial is confusing and unexpected mainly
because a three-year environmental review has already
taken place, and the project was given the go ahead.
The only thing that was delaying construction was the
fact that because the pipeline is transnational, the State
Department has to approve it, giving Obama the abil-
ity to sign the approval. The concern that the president
originally cited after the first environmental review was

the impact on an aquifer in Nebraska, which the pipeline
was planned to run through. Soon after the initial delay,
TransCanada offered to move the pipeline around the
aquifer, incurring significant additional costs, but the
president still refused to act.
The Keystone Pipeline pits two important sectors of
Obama's base, labor unions and environmental groups,
against each other, leading to a delicate political situation.
Instead of making the tough decisions, working through
the issue, and taking a small political hit for the guaran-
teed creation of 20,000 jobs, the president tried to stall
the decision for more than a year, beyond the presidential
election. His lack of action is keeping thousands of union
workers waiting at the shovel. It's ironic that Obama has
shot down this issue because he claims that job creation
is the centerpiece of his campaign.
In contrast to the president's pro-job rhetoric, howev-
er, he has repeatedlyused overblown environmental con-
cerns to stall energy endeavors all over the country. The
American people don't want to wait until it is politically
convenient for the president to make these simple choic-
es. The American people want jobs now, but the president
decided interest groups and lobbyists are more important
than the American worker, at least until 2013. Addition-
ally, in a time when our nation is strugglingto find energy
security, with hostile countries in the Middle East and
LatinAmericathreateningto obstructour oil supply, why
won't the president look to our friendly northern neigh-
bor for a safe, reliable source of energy instead?
After the initial delay of the project, Congressional
Republicans included a provision into the payroll tax
extension passed last year that forced the president to
either approve or deny the project in two months time.
House Republicans, and Speaker of the House John
Boehner in particular, took a major political defeat on the
payroll tax extension to force the president's action on
the Keystone Pipeline, taking the leadership necessary to
create jobs.
Congressional Republicans have done everything in
their power to create a business-friendly environment in
the energy sector, and gave the president another oppor-
tunity to approve the Keystone Pipeline in a timely man-
ner. Unfortunately, the president couldn't put economic
growth and the interests of many job-seeking Americans
over his own political agenda. Obama has consistently
stressed that jobs are priority number one, but when an
easy opportunity to create jobs fell into his lap, he put
special interests ahead of the American worker yet again.

Unlo
the seC(
Smusic's
Jf I could start my under-
graduate education all over
again, I would study the
brain.
The human brain is, as far
as I'm con-
cerned,
absolutely
hands-down
the single
coolest object
inthe entire
known uni-
verse. We can LAUREN
measure it, CASERTA
test it, fool it
and be fooled
by it. We can even operate on
it while its owner is awake (the
brain lacks pain receptors) - but
ittakes only a microscopic clot
to turn it off forever or erase
decades from its memories.
The brain is one of the most
fantastic puzzles yet to be fully
solved by the scientific commu-
nity. So what effect could some-
thing as artistic, emotional and
seemingly unscientific as music
have on arguably the most com-
plex machine in existence?
The effect of music on the
human mind seems like aopic
£completely unfi for quantitative
studyor qualitative research.
Have you ever tried to put into
words how music makes you
feel? How about the reason why
you get a knot in your chest
when someone superimposes
sad piano music over time lapses
of the night sky, or why you get
shivers and chills while listening
to a favorite song?
These emotions are not only
hard to place, they're also dif-
ficult to articulate - conditions
that provide exactly the sort of
challenge any eager scientist
could hope for. And asa former
biology major who enjoys the
smell of agar as much as the
sound of Arensky, a peek into the
science behind art would be a
dream come true.
Thankfully, for those who
refuse to believe that science and
art lie on two separate paths,
hope has emerged alive and well
in the cognitive neuroscience of
music.
The field is essentially a scien-
tific analysis of the brain's chem-
ical and neurological responses
to music. It may sound dry at
first, buta little light reading will
go along way for anyone even
remotely interested in why Bar-
ber's "Adagio for Strings" makes
them cry like a little girl.
Take Montreal Neurologi-
cal Institute researchers Anne
Blood and Robert Zatorre's 2001
study on the relation between
emotion and music. Right in
the first paragraph abstract,
* they announce their intentions
to tackle the mystery behind
the "shivers-down-the-spine"
and "chills" music-listeners
report feeling, which they group
together as "intensely pleasur-
able responses" - a feelingso

surprisingly universal and con-
crete, it required the creation of
a special term just to describe it.
Non-scientific? Not remotely.
The two end up confirming
a connection between these
responses and increased blood
flow in the brain to regions that
control rewards, emotion and
arousal. McGill University cog-

cking
rets of
appeal
nitive neuroscience researcher
Valorie Salimpoor and co. estab-
lished a relationship between
music and the brain's release of
the mood-chemical dopamine
in 2010. It turns out our enjoy-
ment of Bach or Bieber isn't all
in our head - it's a physiological
response to the sound of their
music based on preferences and
predispositions we're still strug-
glingto understand.
Understanding the meaning
behind our musical pleasures is
fascinating, but what does this
mean for the music-listener in
us all? Is science working to
systematically reduce the art of
music into a series of chemical
combos floating around in our
gray matter?
Actually, science is just giving
a serious high five to the human
brain. Music in and of itself is
an art form - ifa song plays in a
forest and there's no one there to
hear it, it's still beautiful - but
our ability to emotionally and
physically connect to a piece
is just one more awe-inspiring
facet of our minds.
Bach and Bieber
are what your
brain wants.
Even if this art-science mix
doesn't blow your own mind, you
can't argue against its effective-
ness.
Every person who has ever
tried to sell you a product, ser-
vice or idea is already well aware
of music's effect on consumers.
Music in commercials is tailored
to make products seem more
trustworthy or services more
friendly. Movies use music to
enhance even the worst plotline
or help you empathize with the
brooding antihero with the hid-
den soft side.
And think about this: Would
the viral KONY 2012 video that's
currently rocketing around the
Internet behalf as effective
without the melancholy violin
warbling in the background?
Would implicit trust tug at your
heartstrings if they'd piped
"Safety Dance" through your
speakers instead? Would you
have bought into their idea as

Science and art may not
immediately come to mind as
a pair, but our still-developing
understanding of our brains
is revealing more and more
each day about the connections
between the equally-inspiring
fields of aesthetics and science.
For those of you who love both,
there's still time to do some
research of your own in this
growing field.
And if you're still not con-

vinced that music can turn
something good into something
visceral, hop over to Vimeo and

Tired tropes in 'Carter'

Slick production,
little else in newest
Disney flick
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
John Carter (Taylor Kitsch,
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine")
is a Confederate veteran who is
transported to
Mars, where
he turns from **
rogue to hero John Carter
and leads an
alien people to At Quality16
a bright future. and Rave
Depending on
who you are, Disney
that either
sounds like the most epic thing
since "World of Warcraft" - or
the stupidest thing since "World
of Warcraft."
The director of this pulpy
adventure is Andrew Stanton,
best known for such films as
"Wall-E" and "Finding Nemo"
... wait, what? How does one go
from directing movies about
cutesy robots falling in love to
this? It's like Disney picked this
guy's name out of a hat. Regard-
less, this odd pairing between

Stanton and Edgar Rice Bur-
roughs's classic sci-fi novel "A
Princess of Mars" might be
appropriate. After all, strange
contrasts are a running theme
within "John Carter."
For example, Bryan Cranston
(TV's "Breaking Bad") makes a
brief appearance as a Union sol-
dier. His appearance is jarring
- the audience has only enough
time to wonder why the hell
Walter White has hair before
they're abruptly thrown into a
chase scene and John Carter dis-
covers some cave that transports
him to the Red Planet. Suddenly,
he's capable of jumping three
hundred feet into the air like
he's on some Spider-Man shit
before he's captured by an alien
race called the Thurns who want
him to fight for their cause, and
wait - there's also a conspiracy!
All that's fine. The exposi-
tion moves swiftly, and it's good
fun. The real problem is the plot
never drops that "jumpy" inco-
herence. It continually bounces
the audience around from scene
to scene. After only a half-hour,
it becomes obvious this film is
trapped in a conflict between
being faithful to the source
material and standing on its own
merits. As a result, "John Carter"

"Look, there go our careers!"
feels incomplete and crammed.
There's an immersive world
in "John Carter," but it's hidden
behind the convoluted plot. The
audience wants to learn more
about the different alien cul-
tures. They want to know why
the human races of Mars are
fighting each other and why the
Thurns hate them so much. Alas,
no such histories are revealed.
The story is too occupied with
plot twists - many of which are
trite and inconsequential - and
a childish love story.
Love story? Of course there's
one! And, of course, it involves

a sensual-but-independent prin-
cess (Lynn Collins, "X-Men Ori-
gins: Wolverine") who wants
to save her planet. Obviously,
Carter has to save her and earn
her respect and love, thus giving
our stock hero a reason to stay
on Mars and fight. It's an old
tale recounted many times. This
time around, it's told with little
vigor or believability. And it cer-
tainly doesn't help that poorly
supplemented by a lifeless script,
both Kitsch and Collins have the
emotional density of a feather.
That said, the visuals are

Muddled, shallow gameplay
plagues horrid 'Deep Black'

By JULIAN AIDAN
For the Daily
While console gamers were
graced in the first week of March
with such titles as "Mass Effect
3," "I Am Alive"
and "Street
Fighter X Tek-
ken," their PC Deep Black
counterparts Reloaded
were greeted
with a handful PC
of uninventive
indie games Biart
and the pain-
ful-to-play arcade-style shooter
"Deep Black: Reloaded."
The game takes place in a
future straightout ofthe mind ofa
hyper-conservative fearmonger.
After the United Nations splits
into two entities, several large
corporations struggle to acquire
some new and extremely danger-
ous weapon in a generic power
struggle for world dominance.
The plot is conveyed through
cutscenes vaguely reminiscent
of comic-books, a la "Kick-Ass,"
which in turn are punctuated by
subpar writing. Every unfunny
and overused character arche-
type is present, from the backwa-
ter drill sergeant to the foreign
concierge, imparted using awful
voice acting and equally abomi-
nable accents. The soundtrack
sounds like it was ripped straight
out of one of the earlier James
Bond films, which adds some
value to an atmosphere that can
otherwise be described as com-
plete and utter shit.
Arcade-style "cover shoot-
ers" - for those unfamiliar with
buzzwords used in video-game
advertising, "cover shooter"
roughly translates to "games for
people who don't actually enjoy
doing anything," - such as "Time
Crisis" occasionally port well to
other platforms. "Deep Black:
Reloaded" does not. The unreli-

SILENT HOUSE
From Page 5A
directors Chris Kentis and
Laura Lau ("Open Water").
The unsteady camera move-
ment and low lighting will give
you chills lasting the major-
ity of the movie. One scene, in
which the flash of a Polaroid
camera is used as an intermit-
tent light source, stands out as
being particularly powerful.
The second highlight of
the film is Elizabeth Olsen,
an up-and-comer who burst
onto Hollywood's radar with
her truly impressive perfor-
mance in "Martha Marcy May
Marlene." The camera follows
Olsen for the span of the film,
providing plenty of close-ups
of her pretty, yet believably
horror-stricken face. Her act-
ing is the most convincing of
the film, giving it a realistic
element that lends to the over-
all unsettling atmosphere.
Unfortunately, even Olsen's
strong performance can't save
"Silent House." The movie
consists of little dialogue,
mostly issued at the beginning
and end. There's also little plot
- in fact, the entire middle
chunk shows Sarah running
around the house, scared out of
her mind. But even with sparse
plot and dialogue, a well-done
horror film can strike fear
in the hearts of its audience.
"Silent House" would have
done just that if the nonsense
ending didn't ruin the whole
viewing experience.
It's a shame that the last
ten minutes of a film can
destroy your entire percep-
tion of it, but the fact remains
that "Silent House" could have
been saved if Kentis and Lau
stuck a little closer to the story
and ending of their source
material. Like most remakes of
foreign films, or any films for
that matter, this one corrupts
the magic and brilliance found
in the original.

Provost talks budget at
Occupy lecture forum

Hanlon reaffirms
University's
commitment to
affordability
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily NewsEditor
Armed with a PowerPoint
presentation before an open
forum of about 50 students, Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon
and Martha Pollack, the Univer-
sity's vice provost for academic
and budgetary affairs, delved
into the details of University
financing as part of a newly
launched lecture series based on
the Occupy movement.
In the presentation, which
was part of the University's
"Equity, Justice and Social
Change: The Michigan Tradi-
tion of Activism and Educa-
tional Opportunity" program,
Hanlon and Pollack discussed
how budgetary priorities range
from ensuring student access to
financial aid, fostering innova-
tion in research and garnering
strong faculty at the University.
Specifically, they addressed the
role tuition costs play in the
budget.
According to Hanlon, tuition
and fees constitute 68.7 per-
cent of the University's revenue,
state appropriation constitutes
16.9 percent and indirect cost
recovery constitutes 13.8 per-
cent. University schools and
colleges receive 57.4 percent of
the budget from those areas of
revenue. Hanlon used these fig-
ures to explain why tuition has
increased.
"What drove us to the actual
tuition increases was loss in
state appropriation and invest-
ment in financial aid," Hanlon
said.

Tuition at the University
has grown at an annual rate of
5.56 percent due to reductions
in state appropriation, invest-
ments in financial aid and
annual cost increases, Hanlon
explained.
To maintain costs, Hanlon
said the University has under-
taken several initiatives to
combat the decrease in state
appropriations, which amounts
to approximately 10 percent less
than the annual appropriations
received in 2002.
While Hanlon described a
variety of University initiatives,
such as eliminating lower pri-
ority services and activities, he
added that cost-saving mecha-
nisms take time to make an
impact.
"All of these initiatives take
a long time to execute," Han-
lon said. "So from the day
you say, 'Okay, I want to put a
regional chiller serving these
five buildings' until it's actually
constructed in the ground and
operating is two to three years."
Hanlon also addressed Presi-
dent Barack Obama's shared
responsibility framework for
public universities, a topic
Obama discussed during his
speech at Al Glick Field House
on Jan. 27. This system relies on
a partnership between the fed-
eral government, the state gov-
ernment and public universities.
If Obama's framework is
implemented, the relationship
could provide more money from
the state, according to Han-
lon, who is hopeful for a budget
increase that could allow the
University to further invest in
financial aid and hire more fac-
ulty members.
"Universities are all about
people," Hanlon said. "What
makes a great university is great
faculty, great students and great
staff, so the budget priorities

are really about trying to get the
best people here and help them
succeed."
Currently, the University
invests in financial aid through
a raise in tuition costs. After the
presentation, students partici-
pated in a question and answer
session, where they specifically
addressed this policy.
Hanlon supported the prac-
tice, explaining that financial
aid is necessary to increase
socioeconomic diversity at the
University and emphasizing
that there is an inherent trad-
eoff between lowering costs and
maintaining academic excel-
lence with both students and
faculty.
"At the University of Michi-
gan, the chief academic officer
is the chief budget officer, and I
think that's one of the strengths
we have here because the com-
bination ensures that academics
get the highest priority when
the budget is allocated," Hanlon
said.
According to Hanlon, the
University competes for fac-
ulty with Harvard University;
Stanford University; the Uni-
versity of California, Berkley;
University of Texas at Austin
and the University of Chicago.
This competitive environment
ultimately leads to higher costs
to keep great educators, and
recruiting and retaining out-
standing faculty is a necessary
factor to function as a success-
ful academic institution, Han-
lon added.
Both Hanlon and Pollack will
be teaching a one-credit UC
course in fall 2012 regarding the
University's budget.
This Friday, Hanlon and Pol-
lack will further discuss how
the University is funded at 5:15
'p.m. in the Kalamazoo Room of
the Michigan League, in a dis-
cussion open to students.

MICHIGAN
From Page 1A
The Wolverines were among
the last names to be called, sim-
ply because the Midwest brack-
et was the last region unveiled
during the selection show. That
meant the team had a good idea
of where it was likely to end up
in the first round as other sites
filled up.
Leading up to Sunday eve-
ning, most analysts and brack-
etologists pegged Michigan as a
No. 3 seed in Columbus, the sec-
ond and third round site closest
to Ann Arbor. Thus, it could've
been a slight disappointment to
instead end up on a lower seed
line and in a location further
away.
But players said they weren't
keeping up with all of the pro-
jections and didn't feel slighted
in the least. Michigan coach
John Beilein, for his part, said
he was just enjoying watching
the show.
"You just don't get over the
moment where you see your
name up there, and then the
suspense of who you're going
to play, and then who you'd play
if you're fortunate enough to
advance," Beilein said. "There's
a lot that goes through our
minds. Our kids are all thrilled.
With the loss (to Ohio State on
Saturday), we're eager to get

back to work."
The team will have quite a bit
of work to do, considering how
poorly the Wolverines played in
the 77-55 loss to the Buckeyes in
the Big Ten Tournament semi-
final, and given that Michigan
does not know much about its
second round opponent.
13-seed Ohio wasn't the best
team in the Mid-American
Conference, finishing in third
place in the East division. But
the Bobcats got hot at the right
time. They won three games in
three days to take the confer-
ence tournament championship,
defeating Akron, who finished
with the best record in the
MAC, by one point in the finals.
Ohio faced just one team
from the six power conferences
this season, falling to then-No.
7 Louisville by five points back
in November. The team faces
long odds in trying to topple
Michigan, but it's pulled an
upset before - the last time the
Bobcats made the NCAA Tour-
nament, they defeated George-
town in 2010 as a No. 14-seed in
their first game.
Other than a couple con-
nections to individual players
on Ohio, the Wolverines don't
know anything about their foe
besides what they've gleaned
from occasionally watching the
Bobcats on television. Beilein,
though, is familiar with coach
John Groce. Groce was an assis-

tant for Thad Matta at Xavier
when Beilein was also in the
Atlantic 10 at Richmond, and
Groce also assisted Matta at
Ohio State before taking the
Ohio job.
"He's done a great job,"
Beilein said. "I believe he's a
very good friend, a close friend,
of (assistant coach) Jeff Meyer
as well. I haven't seen him alot,
(but) you can bet your paycheck
I'm going to be watching a lot
of (his team) the next couple of
days."
The only bright side of Michi-
gan's blowout loss to Ohio State
is that it didn't end the team's
season. Players said that the
defeat will help refocus and
remotivate them heading into
the NCAA Tournament.
The Wolverines are looking
to take another step forward
in the Big Dance, having only
made it to the third round in
the two times they've made the
tourney under Beilein. Michi-
gan hasn't made it to the Sweet
16 since 1994, when members of
the Fab 5 were still patrolling
the court.
"Our kids love this time of the
year, and they really liked their
experience last year, and I'm
sure every one of them would
want to play right until the
end," Beilein said. "And hope-
fully we'll get victory, after vic-
tory, after victory. Just got to get
number one first."


DEMOCRATS
From Page 1A
funding from the state of Mich-
igan was also important for the
growth of the University, say-
ing that in the 1970s, 75 percent
of the University's academic
funding came from the state.
Today, he said about 25 percent
of the general fund is from the
state.
"While it's essential for the
University and the region to

aggressively advocate for fund-
ing for public universities, we
need to (be able to) realistically
assume that this source of fund-
ing needs to be stable," Bern-
stein said.
University alum Shauna
Ryder Diggs, a Grosse Pointe
dermatologist, was unavailable
for comment.
In the Supreme Court
endorsement, the Democratic
Party press release stated that
the party was dissatisfied with
the current Republican-majori-

ty court and its rulings.
"Under the current Supreme
Court, Michigan families have
been under assault with robo-
foreclosures, taxing senior pen-
sions and allowing polluters to
pollute and the taxpayers paying
the cleanup bill," the statement
read. "We need a Supreme Court
that will work to make our com-
munities safe, and where middle
class families can be protected."

Membersof the Michigan basketball team express their frustration during the Wolverines' 77-55 loss to Ohio State in the Big Ten Tournament semifinal at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday.
Buckeyes rout Michigan in semifinal

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - Brutus
brought the brute to the No. 10
Michigan basketball team on Sat-
urda Life Fieldhouse
and theWolverines were caught
without
their gloves MICHIGAN 55
on. OHIO STATE 77
Ohio
State forward Jared Sullinger
shucked two underwhelming
performances against Michigan

earlier this season by the wayside
and took control of the Big Ten
Tournament semifinal, carrying
the Buckeyes to a decisive 77-55
win over the Wolverines.
It was tough to believe that No.
2-seed Michigan was the higher-
seeded team this weekend, as No.
3-seed Ohio State established
dominance under the basket
early and its domain spread to
the perimeter later.
"A lot of things didn't go our
way today," said redshirt sopho-
more center Jordan Morgan. "We

kept fighting, but we couldn't get
a break. Couldn't get a shot to
fall. Couldn't get big loose balls.
It was like we just kept fighting
uphill all day."
Sullinger's 16 points in the
first half were more than he had
in either of the teams' match-ups
earlier this season and in the sec-
ond half he did his damage from
the free throw line.
Sullinger, a former high school
teammate of Michigan fresh-
man point guard Trey Burke,
found points early by spinning

right, spinning left, falling down,
getting offensive rebounds and
sinking jump shots. His 24 points
were a game-high and he added
six rebounds.
"He just was making tough
shots," Morgan said. "I still tried
to make him make tough shots
that I tried to make him make
last game. There's really no way
to guard him when he's making
those shots."
Everything that went right for
Michigan this season went miss-
ing Saturday.

Burke had the worst game of
his season, as Buckeye guard
Aaron Craft stifled him all after-
noon. Burke couldn't find pen-
etration and had to settle for
contested 3-pointers when he
could even get a shot off. The wad5
Michigan attacked Ohio State,
Burke had to shoot jumpers
instead of attacking the rim like
he did against other teams.
"It is (a problem that Ohio
State forces me into jump shots)
when I shoot the way I shot
tonight," Burke said. "But if I was

shooting the way I know I can
shoot, then it wouldn't have been
a problem. We just weren't hit-
ting shots tonight."
Burke didn't make a field goal
until late in the second half and
rmissed each ofhis seven attempts
from 3-point range. He finished
1-for-11 from the floor and also
committed a season-high eight
turnovers.

Burke has career-worst
game in lopsided loss

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke was the talk of the town
in Indianapolis on Friday night
after scoring a career-high 30
points in the Michigan men's
basketball team's overtime win
over Minnesota.
OnSaturdaynight, he wasstill
the center of many conversations
- and no, it wasn't because of his
game-high seven rebounds.
Burke scored 11 of the Wol-
verines' first 12 points and later
scored nine points in overtime
to lead Michigan to a 73-69 vic-
tory over the Golden Gophers.
But the freshman followed his
career night with his worst col-
legiate performance to date.
With Burke held in check
all game long, the Wolverines
faltered, falling to Ohio State,
77-55. It was Michigan's most
lopsided loss of the season.
"It definitely was (my worst
game)," Burke said. "It goes like
that sometimes, I understand
that. (Friday), Ihad a greatgame.
(Saturday), I had a bad game.
"I just think it was a bad night

- an unlucky night - the total
opposite of (Friday)."
Playing against the team he
grew up idolizing as a child, and
matched up against the Big Ten
Defensive Player of the Year in
sophomore point guard Aaron
Craft, Burke never got comfort-
able.
The freshman didn't score
until the 6:55 mark of the sec-
ond half. Before that, he missed
all eight of his shots - including
six 3-pointers - and committed
eight turnovers. His previous
high for turnovers, six, came
back in December.
Burke said that the defen-
sive strategy that Ohio State
employs to stifle the ball screen
that he uses so effectively is
unique to the Buckeyes. It's dif-
ficult to attack, partly because of
Craft's defensive ability, but also
because of the Buckeyes' length.
"They tend to corner me on
the ball screens and (use) brack-
ets," Burke said. "Craft makes
sure I can't use (the ball screen)
and (sophomore forward Jared
Sullinger)'s right there, so it's
kind of like a mini trap. It's just
a look that we really don't see a

lot. We know we're going to see
it against them, but it kind of
throws our offense off.
"We made adjustments to
it, but ... if shots are not falling,
then adjustments aren't going to
work."
Craft and Burke have been
battling since their days of
playing high school basketball
against each other in Ohio, but
both were quick to point out
that Burke's poor performance
wasn't necessarily Craft win-
ning a one-on-one matchup.
"Stopping a great player like
him, especially with how he was
feeling from (Friday), it was defi-
nitely a team effort," Craft said.
"(I was) just trying to not make
it about me against him because
that's not what it's about.
"Our bigs did a great job hedg-
ingball screens today and every-
one else did a good job of zoning
up and not giving easy baskets
for the most part. So it was defi-
nitely a team effort on him."
But at one pivotal moment in
the game, around the halfway
mark of the first half, it did come
down to Craft and Burke.

Freshman phenom Trey Burke, born cool

I

Watching Trey Burke
play the game, you
wonder if he was
born dribbling a basketball, born
smoothly
attackingthe -
basketwith
either hand -
floating, glid-
ing, powering,
however he
wanted. You
wonder if he
was born so TIM
cool. ROHAN
When the
game's on the
line, Michigan's freshman guard
plays his best. When his team
needs him most, he plays his best.
When he's about to go off - which
is all the time - he looks like he's
snarling, the same way Kobe Bry-
ant does before he devours some-
one on the hardwood.
Burke was born snarling, look-
ing to abuse a big man trying
to hedge his pick-and-roll, I'd
imagine.
It's that talent and how he plays
the point-guard position that
make him the beginning and the
end of Michigan's NCAA Tourna-
ment chances.
Look at how the Wolverines
fared in the Big Ten Tournament.
Calm and cool, Burke polished
off a career-high, 30-point mas-
terpiece on Friday, playing all 45
minutes, while other teammates
floundered early against a medio-
cre Minnesota team. Saturday,
Burke had the worst game of his
life - no poise, no legs - and the
Wolverines lost to Ohio State by
22.
There are two reasons Burke's
Saturday meltdown won't be
repeated anytime soon:
No. 1; He hates to lose.

more results out of less talent long
before Douglass and Zack Novak
made doing that popular. Merritt
and Lee were asked if they had
advice for Burke.
"What advice could Igive to
a Trey Burke?" Merritt jokingly
said.
"I talk life in general. He's got
the court all taken care of," Lee
chimed in.
"Ice your knees. Get some rest.
Ice your knees." Merritt said.
"Just continue to do what you're
doing."
For Michigan, letting Burke be
Burke has rewarded Beilein and
the program handsomely - big
shots against Michigan State and
Ohio State come to mind - but
Saturday reminded everyone he's
still just a freshman.
Saturday's growing pains
shouldn't worry anyone, but this
question should start to be asked:
When will Burke become too cool
for school? Or, better put, when
will Burke think so?
"I'm sure he thinks he's ready,"
Benji said. "But I think Trey
needs to stay in school and pre-
pare himself. For one, he has to be
a consistent college point guard.
And I know he had a consistent
year, probably one of the most
consistent years on the team."
Benji said he wants to see his
son get stronger, and he wanted to
make sure Burke would be a solid
first-round pick in the NBA draft
if he left. As of now, Benji said, the
family is "hearing late first, early
second."
For at least another year, Mich-
igan fans can stay as cool as their
point guard: Benji said "for sure"
Burke would be back, snarling,
shooting and staring, next season.

Michigan freshman guard Trey Burke scored 30 points against Minnesota on Friday, but couldn't find his footing against Ohio State in Saturday's semifinal loss.

His father, Benji Burke, remem-
bered Burke starting to play
organized basketball when he was
five. But Burke couldn't keep track
of the score, Benji said, so after
his games Burke would run up to
his father.
"Dad, did we win!?"
Always, Benji would say, "Trey,
you played really, really good."
"(Before,) his team would
lose, and when I'd tell him, he'd
just start crying," Benji said. "It
was like a scene. He would break
down and start crying."
No. 2: Burke really was born
cool, his father admitted, espe-
cially with the ball in his hands.
"When he was really young, it
just came natural to him," Benji
said. "He was really good at han-
dling the ball, with both hands."

Saturday felt peculiar, and it
stands alone in Burke's season of
highlights, because Burke's play -
which included eight turnovers -
wasn't typical. He'll progress back
to his cool mean.
He showed up, figuratively
knocking on John Beilein's door,
cool as a cucumber. Watching
Burke play in summer open gyms,
Matt Vogrich said, everyone knew
then that the savvy Burke would
be their starting point guard.
"You could kind of tell that this
summer - you know, it's hard to
say that (Burke's) really evolved,
because I guess you could tell that
this was a possibility and that this
could happen, the way he's play-
ing," said Stu Douglass, who, as a
senior, was expected to compete
for the pointguard spot at the

start of the season.
That summer, David Merritt
- one of the two original cool
point guards to lead Michigan to
its "welcome back" NCAA Tour-
nament bid in 2009 - played in
the open gyms. He said Burke
couldn't score on him, but added:
"Tim (Hardaway Jr.) wasn't there,
but (Burke) was the best player on
the floor at that open gym."
After the Minnesota game,
Merritt and C.J. Lee, the other
cool guard from the 2009 tourna-
ment run, drank in the Wolverine
locker room that was buzzing
about Burke's game.
"The expectations are get-
ting higher and higher each day,
but we've got better players in
this locker room," Lee said. "It's
as simple as that. That kid, he's

19 years old, but he has a grown
man's game. And he's only going
to get better and better."
Both have front row seats
for Burke's ascension. Lee is on
Beilein's bench as an administra-
tive assistant who works with
Burke on his academics; Merritt is
a radio analyst calling Michigan
games.
"The whole program's goal is to
get back to a point where it's not
necessarily when are we going to
get to the tournament, butthat it's
an every year type of thing that
we expect not only to be in the
tournament, but to make a run,"
Merritt said, looking around the
room.
Neither Lee nor Merritt was as
highly touted or praised as Burke,
but their leadership and poise got

Wolverines struggle at Red and Black Tournament

sending
Chidester ST. LOUIS 3

Those sim- MICHIGAN 1
ple plays ILLINOIS ST. 5
showed
how dangerous the No. 14 Michi-
gan softball team can be.
Sometimes it can be easy to
forget. .
Playing at the Red and Black
Tournament in Louisville
this weekend, the Wolverines
struggled to find their offensive
rhythm in a 2-1 loss against No.
16 Louisville (17-0) on Saturday.
Michigan (16-7) found its bats

the same day against Saint Louis
University (11-11) in a 6-3 win
over the Bilikens, but the team
closed out the tournament on
.Sunday with a disappointing 5-1
loss to Illinois State (12-10).
"I told the kids that confidence
is the most important aspect of
our game," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "Having confi-
dence is the number-one thing
we have to work forward with.
You have to have confidence to
have any chance at success."
The team's lack of confidence
was especially apparent in
the final game of the weekend
against the Red Birds, when the
Wolverines were again unable to
get much going offensively.
"(A) pitcher's goal is to throw
it so you don't have a good
chance to hit," Hutchins said.
"When she doesn't do that, you
have to make her pay. We end up
swinging at bad pitches. Hitting
is contagious and not hitting is

contagious, and you see us do
both."
Michigan began Sunday's
game well when Lane had an
impressive 16-pitch at-bat before
hitting one out of the park in the
second inning.

lie Wagner came in for relief
for freshmsn right-hander Sara
Driesenga. Michigan also pulled
first-time-starter sophomore
right fielder Katie Luetkens for
sophomore Lyndsay Doyle, who
normally plays the position.

"That's a fan
Hutchins said.
"That's one of
the best at-bats
I've ever seen,
and to end up
with a home
run was just
icing."
But it was
all downhill
from there for
the Wolver-
ines.
In the bottom
inning, Illinois St

from Hutchins.V

tastic at-bat," Saturday's games against
Louisville
and St. Louis

"Confidence the Wolver-
ines' offensive

team left seven

of our game. game, failing
to capitalize on

tunities.

t-hander Hay- knows there are three strikes.

We need to have some quality
at-bats and make better contact
whether there (are) runners on
base or not. The good news is we
did have runners on base."
Against the Cardinals, the
Wolverines' first seven batters
were retired.
And after not capitalizing in
the top of the third inning when
the bases were loaded, the Wol-
verines didn't get on the score-
board until the fifth inning,
when an RBI single by senior
center fielder Bree Evans sent
senior third baseman Stephanie
Kirkpatrick home.
It would turn out to be the
only run of the game forthe Wol-
verines.
"When you only score one run
in a game, your offense didn't do
its job," Hutchins said.
Despite the offensive strug-
gles against Louisville, Michi-
gan began to find its groove
against St. Louis, with Chidester

going 4-for-4 with two runs and
two RBIs.
"I thought Chidester was
our best leader this weekend,"
Hutchins said. "There were
some bright spots against (St.
Louis). If we can maintain our
process, that's the key."
The pitching also looked
sharper against the Bilikens.
Driesenga allowed three runs,
but struck out a career-best five
before Wagner came in for relief
at the top of the sixth inning.
It's clear that, moving for-
ward, the Wolverines need
to find some consistency on
offense.
"We have to worry about what
we do," Hutchins said. "We need
someone to have some good at-
bats because it takes a little pres-
sure off everybody. Even though
we certainly saw some (batters)
break out, we need to see more,
and we (also) need to get our
confidence back."

A look at Michigan's NCAA resume

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Over the past week, the Michi-
gan women's basketball team has
been preparing. But for what?
That is still an uncertainty.
The Wolverines sit on the
precarious NCAA Tournament
bubble, and according to ESPN
women's bracketologist Charlie
Creme, Michigan is the second
team out, behind just North Caro-
lina. The Wolverines' resume isn't
great, but it just might be good
enough to earn their first NCAA
Tournament berth since 2001.
Michigan comes in at 20-11 -
its best overall record since coach
Kevin Borseth took over in 2007
- but just 8-8 in conference play.
The Wolverines' lack of a strong
conference record could be attrib-
uted to the strength of the Big
Ten.
"I think our conference has
been better this year, and hope-
fully the committee will see
that," said senior guard Courtney
Boylan.
Following the conclusion of the
Big Ten Tournament and Michi-
gan's second-round loss to Ohio
State, four Big Ten teams sit in the
AP top-25 poll - No.11 Penn State,
a No. 14 Purdue, the 17th-ranked
Buckeyes and No. 20 Nebraska.
The addition of Nebraska to the
conference could be a negative
factor for Michigan's hopes, as the
Cornhuskers are a lock for an at-
large berth, that could potentially

have belonged to the Wolverines.
But two important figures
that the committee looks at are a
team's Ratings Percentage Index
and its record against teams with
a top-50 or top-100 RPI. RPI uses
a team's strength of schedule and
their success against that sched-
ule to give a numerical value.
Michigan currently sits at 44th
in RPI, which is noticeably higher
than last season, when it also sat
on the bubble. The Wolverines'
strength of schedule and their
ability to avoid bad losses against
weaker opponents, which have
plagued them in seasons past,
help their status.
Boyland has been here before
- her postseason tournament
hopes resting in the hands of the
selection committee - and isn't
in unfamiliar territories with the
mixed emotions that are felt while
on the bubble.
"It's hard because you want
it so bad, but there's nothing you
can do right now," Boylan said on
Tuesday. "It's kind of in the hands
of the committee, and that's how
it's been the past couple of years,
so I'm just hoping it turns out dif-
ferent for us."
It might turn out different
because the Wolverines' resume
is thicker than it's been in the
past. Michigan defeated then-No.
11 Ohio State in Ann Arbor on Jan.
7 and traveled to Omaha on Feb.
9 and easily handled then-No. 15
Nebraska. The Wolverines also
beat Florida on the road in the

arc in the first half and shot 16
percent from long range for the
game. That amounted to a dismal
31-percent shooting percentage
overall.
"If we're not hitting shots on
offense, then the defense is going
to kind of break down," Burke
said. "After six or seven posses-
sions, it's going to get tired of
playing defense if you're not hit-
ting shots on offense."
Only senior forward Zack
Novak had a strong game, earn-
ing two tough layups in traffic
and knocking down two 3-point-
ers in his 10-point effort.
After Sullinger was held in
check in the teams' first two
games, Ohio State coach Thad
Matta found a way to get his
sophomore open down low.
Michigan's double-teams were
ineffective and Sullinger was
able to spin out of trouble to find
an open shot or teammate at will.
When it wasn't Sullinger bul-
lying the Wolverines down low,
it was forward Deshaun Thomas
who used his versatility to create
mismatches with the undersized
Wolverines.
The sophomore was effec-
tive inside and out and picked up
where Sullinger left off at half-
time. Thomas took over in the
second half and scored 22 points
on 10-for-15 shooting, adding six
rebounds.
"They've got so much talent
from top to bottom," Morgan
said. "All of their players can kill

you. It's hard trying to strategize
for one person or two people or
three people because even Craft
steps up and hits big threes like
he did today."
Added Michigan coach John
Beilein: "They've got alot of bul-
lets, rockets in that gun, and they
use them very well."
Nothing looked good for
Michigan.
Senior guard Stu Douglass
botched an alley-oop to sopho-
more guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
Morgan missed a dunk on the
baseline and air-balled a four-
footer. Hardaway Jr. got brick-
happy once again and Douglass
got reamed out by Beilein after
missing a long 3-pointer early in
the shot clock.
"They came out with so much
energy," Morgan said. "They
probably were sour about (Michi-
gan's 56-51 victory in February). I
didn't think we were ready for it."
Ohio State went into halftime
up 34-21 after a disastrous Wol-
verine first half. It didn't seem
possible for Michigan to shy away
even more.
But Ohio State guard William
Buford drained a 3-pointer from
the corner to build the lead to 16
to open the second half, and that
lead would only expand. It was
clear that Michigan was counting
down the minutes until it could
return to Ann Arbor.
"Coming out at halftime, we
normally fight back like in Arkan-
sas and many other games that
we played on the road," Hard-
away Jr. said. "Today was very
embarrassing to us and it really
stings a lot."

Michigan senior guard Courtney Boylan is hoping for the Big Dance.

first game of the season.
"I think we deserve to be one of
(the teams in), but the main thing
is what the committee thinks at
this point," Borseth said.
But Michigan's record against
RPI top-50 opponents is a glaring
weakness in its resume. The Wol-
verines are 3-6 in this category,
and 3-9 against teams in the top-
100. Teams like Michigan State,
who are also on the bubble, have
a similar overall record to Michi-
gan, but boast a better conference
record. The Wolverines have a
higher RPI, though, which could
give them an edge to the commit-
tee. Though Michigan's postsea-
son aspirations are in the hands

of a group of people they've never
met, as a senior, Boylan recognizes
the significance of finally achiev-
ing a goal the team has always
had during her entire career as a
Wolverine. But even if it doesn't
get over the NCAA Tournament
hump that has been present for
more than a decade, Michigan
will stillbe playing in the postsea-
son - just at the WNIT.
"It's what we've been work-
ing for ever since I got here,"
she said. "To me, it would pretty
much mean everything. Even if
we don't, we're still playing, and I
still look forward to the opportu-
nity to keep playing even if it's in
the WNIT."

first," said fifth-year senior goal-
tender Shawn Hunwick. "You
never want to play behind the
eight ball. I think our team strug-
gles when we don't get that first
goal."
On Saturday, it was senior for-
ward David Wohlberg who put the
Wolverines up first in the wan-
ing moments of the first period.
With the puck trapped against

the boards, Michigan freed it up
and freshman forward Phil Di
Giuseppe dished it to Wohlberg,
who in turnsniped from the slot to
the top shelf past Notre Dame net-
minder Steven Summerhays.
Wohlberg scored a second time
with a wrister from the slot to put
the Wolverines up 3-0 midway
through the second frame. But
before the arena's public-address
announcer could finish announc-
ing the goal, Notre Dame respond-
ed. The Fighting Irish took control
of the puck after forcing a Michi-

gan turnover in its zone after a
faceoff. A cross-crease pass was
all that forward Peter Schneider
needed to find twine.
The Wolverines took the hits
the night before - five periods
worth of hits. Michigan scored
first Friday, too. But it took a lit-
tle longer for them to walk away
with the win. Just over a minute
into the game, junior forward A.J.
Treais knocked the puck away
from Notre Dame in the neutral
zone, where Di Giuseppe took the
puck to the net. His shot, slowed

down by Summerhays, bounced
off the post, where senior for-
ward Luke Glendening tapped it
in to give the Wolverines the first
lead of the night. It took another
47 minutes before anyone scored
again. And considering Hunwick
had been peppered with shots the
whole game, it seemed inevitable
that one would sneak past him.
With the game tied, then came
overtime. Berenson usually likes
to finish overtime games in the
first five minutes. No such luck
this time.

"It was heart-attack hockey for
the coaches," Berenson said. "I
liked the way we stayed with our
focus."
Michigan dominated posses-
sion throughout the first 20 min-
utes of overtime, but Summerhays'
14 saves stood between them and
finishing the game. Enter over-
time NO. 2, where it took junior
forward Chris Brown to find the
game-winning goal.
Brown collapsed on the ice
before retreating to the locker
room for an ice bath - the Wol-

verines were expected to do it all
again on Saturday.
Berenson was never too con-
cerned about left over fatigue from
Friday translating into Saturday.
"Mentally and physically,
our team matches up well with
teams," Berenson said. "Our team
has worked as hard as any team
in the spring, summer and fall off
the ice. That's when it shows up,
in a weekend like this. It's a track
meet. You've got to be able to go
back and forth, back and forth and
take the hits and keep going."

ICE HOCKEY
Seniors relish
final game at Yost

ERIN KIRKLAND,
Michigan junior forward Chris Brown scored the game-winning goal on Friday, snapping a wrist shot into the net early in the second overtime period.
Deep in the heart of overtime, Chris
Brown emerges as Michigan's hero

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
About three and a half hours
after Friday's marathon game
began, the hero sat in a cold tub.
At least that's how senior cap-
tain Luke Glendening put it after
he emerged from a victorious
Michigan locker room.
And the hero, junior forward
Chris Brown, could barely pick
himself off the ice and into the ice
bath after his game-winning goal
in double overtime.
"I jumped," said Brown,
describing his celebration. "And
then Jeff (Rohrkemper) just bur-
ied me, and Ijust lay on the ice. (I)
let the other guys come pick me
up."
Regular-season overtime lasts
just five minutes before the game
goes to a shootout, but in the play-
offs, overtime continues until
someone scores. As Friday's game
entered the second extra frame,
both No. 4 Michigan and No. 17
Notre Dame neared utter exhaus-
tion. At one timeout, Brown stood
by the bench, hands on the dasher,
head down, hunched over from

fatigue.
Earlier, in the first overtime,
Brown raced down the entire
length of the ice, beat both Notre
Dame defenders along the boards
and made a cross to freshman
forward Alex Guptill, who nearly
converted for the win.
He didn't have much time to
recover. In the second overtime
period, the fourth forward line
fought alongthe boards for a loose
puck in the Notre Dame zone.
That gave freshman forward Zach
Hyman enough time to skate to
the bench for a line change.
Brown snuck on, unnoticed
by the Notre Dame defense. The
loose puck bounced to sophomore
defenseman Mac Bennett, who
moved it to an open Brown.
The Texan buried a wrister
from the slot to give Michigan an
emotional 2-1 victory deep in the
heart of overtime.
"(I was) really tired coming off
the bench going out for our next
shift," Brown said. "Mac totally
sold it, the guy thought that he
was going to shoot, he slid it right
over to me, and I just tried to put
it on net."

Brown's goal came three min-
utes into the second overtime
period, but it was months in
the making. Before the season,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
put the team through grueling
workouts up and down the steps
of Michigan Stadium. As part of a
Berenson tradition, generations of
teams have raced up all 95 rows of
the Big House in all ways imagin-
able. Running, bounding, hopping
- with two legs and with one -
even carrying teammates.
Those workouts, Brown said,
decided the game.
"Our team has worked as hard
as anyteam in the spring, summer
and fall off the ice," Berenson said.
"And that's when it shows up, ina
weekend like this."
Added Brown: "It's that sta-
dium run that always gets to us.
We always remember that going
into overtimes. No other team
does the stadium like we do, so if
we can get through that, we can
pretty much get through every-
thing."
And so far, Michigan has. The
Wolverines improved to 5-0 in
games decided in overtime.

That fifth victory didn't come
easy on Friday. After Glenden-
ing scored one minute into the
contest, Michigan suffered an
82-minute scoring drought.
Notre Dame evened the score in
the third and dominated the rest
of the period.
Both fifth-year senior goal-
ie Shawn Hunwick and Notre
Dame goalie Steven Summerhays
bailed out their team on several
occasions in a frenetic overtime
period, what Berenson called
"heart-attack hockey."
Brown's goal put an end to
Michigan's longest CCHA playoff
game since 1989, when Bowling
Green defeated the Wolverines in
three overtimes. That season was
the last time Michigan failed to
reach the CCHA semifinals, and
the Wolverines have now made
them 23 straight years with their
series-clinching win on Saturday
night.
None of that was on Brown's
mind on Friday night.
What was?
"(Making) sure we could end
the game and I could just go to
bed," Brown said.

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team
was tiptoeing a fine line on Sat-
urday night with two minutes
remain-
ing against NOTEBOOK
Notre Dame.
The Wolverines were up 3-1,
but sophomore defenseman Jon
Merrill was whistled for high-
sticking just seconds after the
Fighting Irish pulled their goal-
tender, Steven Summerhays. No.
4 Michigan was going to be down
two men for the last two minutes
of the game, trying to hold on for
a CCHA quarterfinal sweep of
Notre Dame.
This came after the teams
played more than 83 minutes
of hockey in a double-overtime
thriller the night before - both
squads were breathing a little
heavier than usual. Then in a
perfect microcosm of this senior
class - and really the last three
months - Michigan killed it.
There were Wolverines flying all
over the ice, diving and sprinting
to the very end.
"(Goaltender Shawn) Hun-
wick had to be a penalty killer,
(defenseman Greg) Pateryn had
to block shots like a goalie, (for-
ward) Luke Glendening did," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson. "I
thought our seniors really, really
stepped up this weekend."
Senior forward David Wohl-
berg was the difference on
offense, scoring a goal in both the
first and second periods on Sat-
urday. But the lynchpin, as usual,
was Hunwick. He had 37 saves on
Friday and 25 on Saturday, cap-
ping his brilliant career at Yost.
"I was hoping I could get a
sixth year, maybe a gray year,"
Hunwick joked. "It's sad. ... I
thought I was going to play one
minute of one game, hopefully on
senior night, when I came here.
"To play this many games at
Yost, I can't be too upset about
the career I've had here."
Hunwick, the former walk-
on, picked slap shots out of the
air and threw back one-on-noune
situations with ease both nights.

"He's a warrior," said Beren'
son. "He's done everything he
can for this team and this pro-
gram."
Both Hunwick and Wohlberg
mentioned how loud the crowd
was in the last period - prob-
ably the rowdiest the fans and
the student section, the Children
of Yost, have been all season.
In their last game at Yost, the
seniors got reflective.
"The fans here are great and
they helped us out alot tonight,"
Wohlberg said. "It's one of those
things that you don't forget about
when you look back and see
which games you won."
FIVE OR SIX, OR MAYBE FIVE:
During Friday's 2-1 victory,
Michigan went with five defen-
seman instead of the usual six
for most of both overtime peri-
ods, leaving freshman Brennan
Serville next to Berenson on the
bench.- Notre Dame's only goal
came on a playwhere Serville got
caught out of position and basi-
cally screened Hunwick in front
of the net. What the goalie can't
see, the goalie probably can't
save. That sixth defenseman spot
has been in flux ever since the
return of Merrill in January from
a suspension. Serville manned it
this weekend, but freshman Mike
Chiasson has also been starting
in that spot.
As the. games continue to
become more crucial, it might
not matter who is playing the
sixth defenseman spot. Berensono
might stick with five veterans, at
risk of fatigue, rather than plug-
ging in a freshman with no play-
off experience on the ice.
ST. PATTY'S AT THE JOE: The
last seed in the CCHA Tourna-
ment, Bowling Green, played the
spoiler role this weekend, send-
ing No. 1 seed Ferris State home
early. That means Michigan is
the highest-remaining seed in the
Tournament, and will play Bowl-
ing Green on Friday.
Western Michigan and red-
hot Miami (Ohio) will play in the
other semifinal game.
The winner of Friday's games
will play in the COCHA final un
Saturday.

Michigan embraces 'Burn the Boats' mentality vs. ND

ByMATT SLOVIN
DailySportsEditor
The No. 4 Michigan hockey
team emerged from its locker
room before Saturday's game
against Notre Dame wearing
shirts with the team motto, "Burn
the Boats," prominently displayed.
"(Sophomore forward Luke)
Moffatt brought it up this year,"
said sophomore forward Derek
DeBlois last month. "It has to
do with the Vikings. When they
would go to fight, they would burn
their boats. No retreat, you just
kind of lay all your chips on the
table and fight until you win."
If any unit took those words
especially to heart during the
sweep of the Fighting Irish, it
was the Wolverine penalty killers
and fifth-year senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick.
Beginning with Michigan's
January split in South Bend, the
Wolverines successfully killed all
15 of Notre Dame's power plays
they faced this season.
"It just shows how good our
coaching staff is and how bad
people want to work on the ice
for us," said senior forward David
Wohlberg. "The penalty killers out
there were getting in front of shots
and doing everything they can to
help out the team - that's what
makes teams go far."
And the Fighting Irish man
advantage is no slouch - Notre
Dame takes few penalties and
usually capitalizes on those of
its opponents, but its power play
became frustrated this weekend.
Instead of paying for any of Michi-
gao's five penalties, the Wolver-
ine penalty kill made a statement
on each, throwing bodies in front
of pucks and forcing the Fighting
Irish out of the attacking third.
"It's not surprising that they
had a good power play," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"You look at their personnel and
there is a team with two of the five
or six top scorers in the league."
Hunwick led the penalty kill's

dominating performance. Beren-
son consistently stresses that as
Hunwick goes, so goes the rest
of the penalty-kill unit. Despite
a death in the family last week
that caused him to miss a day of
practice, Hunwick's focus never
wavered as he snatched pucks out
of the air, allowing just two goals
on the entire weekend.
He admitted it was a "tough
week" for him and his family, but
he kept his emotions in check,
thwarting several Notre Dame
breakaway attempts. And Hun-
wick rose to the occasion when
his team needed him most - when
the Fighting Irish had the person-
nel advantage.
But Hunwick was hardly the
only Wolverine that caused Notre
Dame's power play to leave empty
handed. Michigan racked up the
blocked shots, sending puck after
puck out of its defensive zone -
much to Hunwick's delight, as
he received much needed rests.
Saturday, Michigan's leader in
blocked shots came as a bit of a
surprise - senior forward Luke

crowd rose to its feet to applaud
the penalty kill's efforts as Notre
Dame was forced into a late time-
out to regroup.
"It was still anyone's game,"
Berenson said. "We did that,
whether it was blocking shots or
winning faceoffs or getting the
puck out."
When the clock reached triple
zeros, Michigan had blocked a
total of 16 shots en route to earn-
ing its 23rd-consecutive appear-
ance at Joe Louis Arena for the
CCHA semifinals.
Though Berenson hopes the
Wolverines will be conscien-
tious of the penalties they take
there, if they are forced to play a
man down, all that's left to do is
burn the boats - no surrender, no
retreat.

the most flying pucks. This time,
however, it was a total team effort.
That didn't stop Berenson from
