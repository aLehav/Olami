More than 30 stem cell
researchers, administrators and
industry members from stress
Michigan met Thursday at the
Biomedical Science Research
Building to discuss the future of
stem cell research in the state.
The event featured stem cell
researchers from the Univer-
sity, Michigan State University,
Oakland University and Wayne
State University, marking the
first formal collaboration with
multiple research institutions in
the state.
At the conference, research-
ers discussed the progression of
stem cell research at the Univer-
sity's A. Alfred Taubman Medical

for Stem Cell Therapies - acenter
for scientists to develop new stem
cell lines that was announced
on the same day that President
Barack Obama lifted the federal
restrictions on embryonic stem

Despite bankruptcy,
research funding still
available
By LARA ZADE
ManagingNews Editor
Due to the University's reliance
on General Motors Corp. for re-
search project sponsorships and
job opportunities for graduates,
the corporation's bankruptcy will
affect the agendas of many Univer-
sity students and faculty.
According to Sponsored Awards
on the Web, a search engine for the
University's database of sponsored
proposals and awards, GM spon-
sors 29 awards, totalling over $25

million in anticipated award dol-
lars. The awards help fund specific
research projects at the University
including the Multiscale Simula-
tion and Optimization of Batteries
in Multimode Drivetrains in the
Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering.
David Munson, dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering, said Tuesday
that he has no reason to believe GM
will not follow through with any of
its promised award contracts.
"We have a lot of research sup-
ports from GM, especially in me-
chanical engineering," Munson
said. "I think we're going to have to
wait and see if GM is going to honor
all of those research contracts. We
don't have any info that they won't
(honor the contracts), but that will

be up to the bankruptcy judge."
On Friday, Munson wrote in an
e-mail interview that he learned
the University was added to GM's
list of "preferred vendors," a class
of vendors designated by the court
as "critical."
"This should greatly lessen any
concern that GM support of re-
search at UM could be at risk,"
Munson wrote.
Law School Prof. John Pottow,
a bankruptcy and commercial law
expert, said that because GM des-
ignated the University as a "pre-
ferred vendor," it is likely that the
University will receive all of its
promised awards.

New solar car a stellar success

'U'Infinium is ready to
outshine competitors
across the world
By ERIC CHIU
For the Daily
More than 300 fans, sponsors
and Michigan residents packed
into the Henry Ford Museum in
Dearborn on Friday afternoon for
the unveiling of the University
Solar Car Team's latest vehicle:
Infinium.
The Solar Car Team is a student
group that has funded and con-
structed its own solar-powered car
for national and international races
since 1990. It is comprised of 24
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents throughout various Univer-
sity schools.
The University's team is among
the elite, winning five of the past
nine North American Solar Chal-
lenge races - a solar car event that
pits various American and Cana-
dian universities in a race across
North America.
Jeffrey Ferman, a University
alum and a former member of the
Solar Car Team alum, said he went
to the unveiling because of his belief
in the team's potential.
"They're closer than a lot of the
teams that I've been on in the past,
and this is still months away from
the race," Ferman said.
During the hour-long presenta-

tion, team members, faculty and
supporters of the Solar Car Team
talked about the team's history, its
significance for the University and
the hours of work the team put into
Infinium, for which production
began in fall of 2007.
College of Engineering senior
Alex Dowling, head strategist for the
team, said the design philosophy for
Infinium was drawn from scratch
but incorporated improvements fro
its predecessor, Continuum.
"Our team prides ourselves onthe
fact that we always redesign," Dowl-
ing said. "We take-lessons learned
from the previous teams, but there's
always a redesign process."
Dowling said Infinium is one of
the best cars the Solar Car Team has
ever produced. In addition to reduc-
ing the car's weight and making the
body more aerodynamic, the team
enabled Infinium to travel more
than 200 miles without sunlight.
College of Engineering senior
John Federspiel, the team's crew
chief, said one of the team's major
goals was to finish Infinium as early
as possible - something the team
was able to accomplish.
The team finished Infinium one
month earlier than it took to com-
plete Continuum, and unlike its
predecessor, Infinium was already
drivable at the unveiling.
Both Dowling and Federspiel
attributed much of the team's cur-
rentsuccesstothe members' healthy
work dynamic.
Federspielsaid members fromthe

team's sub-departments were will-
ing to work numerous late nights in
order to finish Infinium.
"We've really bonded well as a
leadership body, and we've learned
from the dynamic conflicts we've
had in the past," Federspiel said.
"Everyone respected each other,
(but) we mightnot have understood
each other's work, and now I think
there's been a good effort and a
strong effort to try and understand
what everyone does."
Despite the Solar Car Team's
progress, the team still had its work
cut out for it. Currently, the team is
preparing Infinium for the Global
Green Challenge in October.
During the six-day challenge the
Solar Car Team will race against 50

other teams from around the world
on an 1,800-mile course across the
Australian outback.
The team plans to test Infinium
through a variety of different sim-
ulations - including a mock race
- during the summer to prepare
before its shipment to Australia in
September.
Federspiel said the team is con-
fident the car will do well in the
upcoming race.
"Based on the numbers that we've
seen (and) based on some of the new
innovations that we've (added) on
(to) this car, I think we definitely are
a top competitor," he said. "I can't
say first or anything like that, obvi-
ously, but I know we'll be one of the
favorites going in."

think it also tastes better than ice reason for Yogobliss' success is

because frozen yogurt's popularity
appears to be a national trend.
"Nationwide, it's growing pret-
ty rapidly," Ahn said. "If you see
the trends of Pink Berry and Red
Mango (other popular shops that
specialize in frozen yogurt)... we
just want to capture some of that
trend."
Kinesiology sophomore Jenna
Spinei, a Yogobliss employee, said
frozen yogurt is a growing trend
that has just started to infiltrate the
Midwest.
"In the west coast, (frozen
yogurt) is really popular and in the
east coast also," Spinei said, "and
it's starting to come inwards (to the
Midwest)."
Alyssa Krentzel, a School of
Music, Theater & Dance sophomore
and employee at the Stucchi's State
Street location, said she believes
frozen yogurt's surging popularity
is due to its healthy ingredients.
"People who are looking for
healthier alternatives go for the
frozen yogurt," Krentzel said.
At Amer's Mediterranean Deli
on State Street, there is an ample

selection of tart frozen yogurt and
premium ice cream. But Emily
Brooks, an Amer's employee and
University alum, said most cus-
tomers prefer frozen yogurt to ice
cream.
"Frozen yogurt, definitely (is a
more popular choice)," Brooks said.
"It's pretty trendy right now."
Bubble Island on South Univer-
sity is also capitalizing on the fro-
zen yogurt trend.
The local bubble tea vendor has
been offering frozen yogurt for
about three months now, accord-
ing to LSA senior Kyle Welton, a
Bubble Island employee.
"(Frozen yogurt) is catching hold
a little bit, especially since now it's
summer," Welton said.
He added that Bubble Island's
frozen yogurt sales have been
growing each week because of the
warm weather.
LSA freshman Matam Naamani,
a first-timer at Yogobliss, said
though he thinks that "ice cream
is pretty timeless," after trying fro-
zen yogurt, he now believes frozen
yogurt is better.

Yet Spinei thinks that ice cream
and frozen yogurt each have their
individual merits.
"Frozen yogurt is healthier, ice
cream is more of a treat," Spinei
said.
Spinei believes that frozen
yogurt - although a current trend
- will never overtake ice cream in
popularity.
"Ice cream is just its own catego-
ry, with its own addicts," she said.
Kevin Phelps, manager and co-
owner of the Stucchi's on State
Street and South University, said
more customers buy traditional
ice cream, adding that yearly sales
typically consist of 60 percent
ice cream and 40 percent frozen
yogurt.
But Ahn said he's optimistic
about frozen yogurt becoming an
all-time favorite dessert like ice
cream.
"With the way it's growing,
it certainly appears it could be a
staple," Ahn said. "I mean there's a
chance it couldbe a trend,but we're
just trying to capitalize on it. We're
hopeful that it'll become a staple."

Adult supervision required
Credit CARD Act discourages young adult financial independence
.College students need a babysitter. Or at least that's what the feder-
al government thinks, if the Credit Card Accountability, Respon-
sibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 is any indicator. The Credit
CARD Act requires all credit card applicants under the age of 21 to have
a co-signer above the age of 21 or to prove their ability to be responsible
with a credit card. But the law doesn't respect the autonomy of college-
aged individuals as legal adults and hurts their financial independence.
Though the CARD Act has its merits, the federal government should
reevaluate the need to treat young adults like children.

A salary; medical, dental,
vision, prescription, and life
insurances; retirement savings
partially matched by the Uni-
versity; and legal and long term
disability plans don't seem to be
enough benefits for University
staff members. According to an
article in the Ann Arbor News on
May 23, they are requesting sub-
sidized tuition for their depen-
dents, citing the recent economic
downturn as the reason and put-
tingthe needs of their dependents
before the 41,000 tuition-paying
students at the University (Uni-
versity of Michigan cool to tuition
benefitfor staff 05/23/2009).
Specifically, staffers are asking
the University to match funds in
the Michigan Education Trust -
a program in which parents can
pay tuition for a state university
early at a rate that will not change
when tuition is raised in later
years. The staffers are request-
ing a match of up to $3,000 per
dependent. They argue that for
the University to remain com-
petitive with other institutions,
it must create some sort of tuition
program for its employees.
But the University already
providesha considerable number
of benefits. University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham was
quoted in the Ann Arbor News
saying the University is already
"at or above average" employee
benefits. This alone negates the
argument staffers are putting
forward about attracting top
employees.
Thisrequestwouldhaveserious
consequences for the University.
Subsidizing tuition for employ-
ees' children would be extremely
costly. There are 36,000 people
employed full time by the Univer-
sity in Ann Arbor, Dearborn and
Flint, not including graduate stu-
dent instructors and researchers.
Who would pay the extra cost that
such a financial burden would
place on the University?
Staffers suggest the Univer-
sity could make up the differ-
ence with discretionary funds
and private donations. This sug-
gestion is naive and misguided.
If there is extra money floating
around, it should be tapped for
the student body as a whole, to
fund programs to cutatuition for
all students. Today's economy is
tough for everyone, not just those
who happen to be progeny of
University staff. If the University
can only afford to cut tuition for
a small handful, the qualification
to obtain aid should be based on

financial need, not employment
with the University.
The reality is that the Univer-
sity is raising tuition for every-
one. The Board of Regents have
made it clear that there isn't
enough money to maintain the
University's current operations
- let alone proposed additional
costs like subsidized tuition for
the children of University staff
- without raising tuition once
again. If extra money is going to
come from anywhere, it's likely to
come fromthe pockets of students
already paying full tuition. To
ask already financially burdened
students to subsidize the educa-
tion of the children'of University
employees is a selfish demand.
The staff argues that in these
tough times, the University
should be taking care of its own.
While the University acknowl-
edges this, it also must recognize
that it has an equal responsibility
to each of its students - not just a
select few. If the University were
to raise tuition yet again to com-
ply with this request, it would be
ignoring the needs of the major-
ity of its students.
The good news is that the Uni-
versity doesn't seem inclined to
oblige this request. The Univer-
sity feels the strain of the failing
economy, too, and it doesn't think
that its staff is in danger of being
stolen by universities with bet-
ter tuition plans for dependents.
The case presented by University
employees fails to provide a suf-
ficient reason for the tuition plan,
other than not wanting to pay for
their children to go to college. If
that alone were a good enough
reason, everyone in the country
would qualify for a tuition plan.
The clincher that makes the
staffer's request ridiculous lies
in the nature of the MET. MET
tuition can go toward any of the
13 public universities in Michi-
gan. That means the University's
money could pay for a college
education at another college,
which is absurd. The Univer-
sity would see zero return on its
investment. Education for every-
one is important, but this request
goes too far.
And this proposal means an
even darkerrpossibility - tuition
could be raised to subsidize
tuition for University staffers
who could use the money to send
their kids to Michigan State Uni-
versity. Ouch.

President Barack Obama
signed the Credit CARD Act
into law on May 22 to protect
American consumers from some
of the unfair practices of credit
card companies. The law was
designed to help credit card
holders make informed financial
decisions by banning retroac-
tive rate increases and fees and
making credit card terms clear-
er. But Title III of the Credit
CARD Act goes further, estab-
lishing barriers before young
adults can obtain a credit card.
The law mandates that credit
card 'applicants under 21 have
"a parent, guardian, or other
qualified individual" co-sign
their credit card application or
prove their financial responsi-
bility. If young adults decide to
take full responsibility for their
credit card and can't provide
documentation that convinces
a credit card company they are
financially stable, they will be
required to complete a financial
literacy course.

It's admirable that the fed-
eral government has decided to
protect consumers from credit
card companies' misleading
tactics. The Credit CARD Act
protects consumers from hid-
den fees and rate increases. It
ensures that consumers can eas-
ily understand their credit card
terms and decide if they are able
to successfully use them. But
this decision should be left to
all consumers, not only those
21 and older.
Despite the good qualities
of the Credit CARD Act, the
restrictions laid out in Title III
seem like a lot of work to obtain
a card that makes a financially
stable future possible. While
it's nice that the federal govern-
ment wants to protect younger
citizens, this clause is a major
stumbling block for young
adults who are ready for finan-
cial independence.
By making young adults jump
through more hoops to obtain
a credit card than older adults,
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

the federal government is tak-
ing the view that college-aged
people aren't really adults yet.
But as legally-recognized adults,
18-year-olds have most of the
same rights and responsibilities
as other adults. Also, many 18-
to 20-year-olds are financially
independent and work on their
own. Many - especially col-
lege students and lower-income
young adults - don't have easy
access to a financially stable co-
signer, a full bank account or
time to complete a financial lit-
eracy course. But they still need
the benefits of a credit card, like
convenient purchases and estab-
lishing good credit history.
Instead of allowing young
adults the freedom they need
to gain financial stability, the
federal government seems com-
mitted to mollycoddling them.
At some point, the federal gov-
ernment needs to realize that
college students aren't kids any-
more and that they need to learn
to take care of themselves.

All apologies


At some point when you
were growing up, you
probably had a tough time
fitting in. Maybe
the "cool group"
of kids didn't
like you. Maybe
that cute class-
mate who sat
next to you in
math wouldn't
talk to you. Per- CHRIS
haps you were KOSLOWSKI
popular and
tried to reach
out to that strange kid who ate his
boogers, but he totally blew you
off. You might have sought advice
from your parents, who probably
said something like, "Hey, all you
can do is be yourself. If people
don't accept you for who you are,
that's their problem."
I'm sure a mentor in President
Barack Obama's childhood told him
something similar. Sadly, he seems
to have forgotten this guidance
on his recent trips abroad. Rather
than urging foreign governments
to accept the United States as it is,
Obama is apologizing for his nation
and trying to paint it as something
it's not. If Obama wants to improve
foreign relations, speaking dishon-
estly about America isn't the right
place to start.
Before his important speech
about Middle East-American rela-
tions in Cairo on Thursday, Obama
said in an interview with a French
television network, "If you actu-
ally took the number of Muslim
Americans, we'd be one of the larg-
est Muslim countries in the world."
But if you look at the range of dif-
fering estimates, America would be
between the 20th- and 50th-largest.
Obama's underlying point that
the U.S. is a religiously diverse
nation is true. But misrepresenting
demographics is not how Obama
shouldbe promotingAmerica'sreli-
gious freedom. In an e-mail to the
Christian Broadcasting Network,
Obama wrote that the U.S.. is "no
longer just a Christian nation." He
knows our country is not defined
by the number of members in a cer-
tain faith. How many Muslims we
actually have within our borders
should be inconsequential against
the important fact that America
is a fair, nurturing country for all
peaceful religions, regardless of
their prevalence.
Similarly, Obama's promise
in Prague on Apr. 5 to "seek the
peace and security of a world with-
out nuclear weapons" is another
deliberate mischaracterization of
America aimed to garner foreign

support. Any reasonable person
would agree that nuclear weapons
are horrendous and should never
be used. But America prides itself
on responsible management of its
nuclear arsenal. We keep bombs
in order to deter the bad guys from
using them. Pledging to rid the
world of nuclear weapons is analo-
gous to promising world peace -
it's not going to happen.
Instead of spouting pie-in-the-
sky rhetoric while North Korea
tests ballistic missiles, Obama
should be working with foreign
leaders to ensure that nuclear
weapon technology doesn't fall
into the hands of those with dan-
gerous intentions. That has been
the policy of the U.S. since the Cold
War, and despite Obama's utopian
dreams, he knows he will continue
that policy. Why waste time trying
to convince the world that America
is going to do something it's not?
Obama shouldn't
twist the truth
to look better.
In an interview on June 1 with
the BBC's Justin Webb, Obama
claimed his speeches were about
encouraging dialogue, rather than
apologizing for the actions of the
Bush administration. But in that
same interview, Obama chastised
America for imposing its values
on other countries. Reading from
a teleprompter in Strasbourg,
France on April 3, Obama said, "In
America, there's a failure to appre-
ciate Europe's leading role in the
world... America has shown arro-
gance and been dismissive, even
derisive." That sounds apologetic
to me. How often do you hear a for-
eign leader come to America and
apologize for his or her country?
You don't, because they believe
what theyare doing is right. Obama
should think the same way.
The American spirit isn't one of
arrogance. Americans are proud of
what their country stands for, and
foreign leaders will not be fooledby
Obama's attempts to make it seem
otherwise. Obama needs to stop
trying to make America appeal to
other countries through misrepre-
sentation. Instead, he should work
to convince other nations to trust
and respect the U.S. for what it is.

At some point, I will be the ex-president, and
then you will find me in France, I'm sure,

He's right. Most of us know little

is, without question, linked to the
continent's portrayal by charities

rather than cities and that many
countries experience political
unrest. But they don't know how
these problems vary from country
to country, as I found when dis-
cussing my trip with people when I
came home. Many displayed a mild
degree of ignorance, asking if I
stayed in a tent or a hotel, or if I was
at risk of contracting tuberculosis.
Some didn't seem to know that
the country I was in even existed.
One student in my group from the
University of Michigan called her
credit card company to say she was
going to South Africa, to which
the representative responded,
"Which country?"
The misguided perception that

all African countries are the same
isn't surprising. The continent
receives most of its exposure from
celebrity-sponsored charities that
inform us about continental issues.
It'sdifficulttoignore productsfrom
Bono's (Product)Red campaign
against HIV/AIDS or the 2005
Live 8 concert festival intended to
raise awareness about African pov-
erty. Such projects are admirable
ways of providing emergency relief
to a continent that needs it. But
they spread the false perception
that Africa's poverty can be solved
through charity alone, which leads
people to believe that the problems
each country faces are identical.
In reality, each country faces
different problems, and long-term
solutions to those problems will
vary from country to country. In
South Africa, for instance, over-
coming poverty and disease will
require overcoming de facto seg-
regation, which still exists despite
the collapse of apartheid in 1994.
Most South Africans who are
white, Indian or of a mixed heri-
tage earn normal or high incomes
by U.S. standards, and the poor-
est citizens are predominantly of
African descent. For this reason,
solutions in South Africa require
more than just charity. They will
require equalizing a segregated
job market and restructuring a
largely private health care system
that primarily caters to those who
already have money.
Media and news sources also
contribute to the one-country
myth by perpetuating stereo-
types that the continent is run
solely by corrupt governments.
News stories tend to mask the true
progress achieved by developing
governments .and portray Africa
as a continent destined to diverge
into disorder.
Media coverage of South Africa
uses these stereotype by imply-
ing that its government is not
yet a true democracy due to its

lack of a competitive party sys-
tem. When the New York Times
and The Economist covered the
recent South African presidential
election, they focused heavily on
this point. They drew attention
to the fact that no political party
can compete with the African
National Congress, the party that
has won every presidential elec-
tion and controlled South Africa's
Parliament since 1994. But it's the
South African citizens who have
always voted for the ANC in large
numbers. This trend is unlikely
to change in the near future. The
insistence that these results are
disappointing undermines the fact
that South African officials are
elected democratically and fairly.
Hey Oprah,
Africa isn't only
one country.
Charities and media sources
have succeeded in making us
believe that Africa is one giant dis-
ease stricken, impoverished coun-
try engaged in civil war. We are
willing to donate billions of dol-
lars to Africa and simultaneously
hesitant to believe that its govern-
ments are developing democracies.
Because of this distorted view, we
have not realized thatthe countries
that make up Africa are diverse and
the solutions to their problems will
have to be diverse as well. In South
Africa's case, charity alone will not
fix the systematic segregation that
fuels poverty. If we can collectively
change our perception of Africa
from that of a homogeneous conti-
nent, we will find it be beneficialto
our desire to help.

VW STEM CELLS
From Page 1
cell researchers and industries
from across the state.
"The goal is to bring together
as many people as we could from
different parts of the state, focus-
ing on primarily - in this meet-
ing - universities from across the
state and then also some industry
representatives from across the
state," Smith said.
Carol Brenner, an associate pro-
fessor of physiology at Wayne State
University, said the conference
also enabled stem cell researchers
to discuss how to educate the pub-
lic about stem cell research, which
must take place in order for it to
progress in the state.
"I think that's what also is very
important - to educate our gradu-
ate students, our undergraduate
students (and) students who want
to stay in Michigan," Brenner
said.
She added that the education
needs to occur at all Michigan uni-
versities.
"It needs to take place at all of
the universities though, not just in
one place," she said, "because we
then, essentially, accelerate our
knowledge base through the stu-
dents so they then teach the next
person."
Researchers from each of the
four universities discussed their
areas of interest within stem cell
research, which ranged from tis-
sue-engineeringresearchtogener-
ating skeletal and facial structures
to the effects of alcohol, nicotine
and caffeine on the brain.
Edward Goldman. an adiunct

assistant professor in the Uni-
versity's department of internal
medicine, discussed the ethical,
regulatory and legal issues regard-
ing stem cell research in Michigan
since the passage of Proposal 2
and Obama's removal of the ban on
embryonic stem cell research.
Goldman said that researchers
in Michigan are now able to com-
pete with stem cell research being
done in other states.
"We are now on a level playing
field with other states,"-he said. "It
allows us to do the research that
we want to do."
Goldman told the researchers
that because Proposal 2 passed
by a narrow margin of 52 to 48
percent last November, plenty of
opposition to embryonic stem cell
research still exists in the state.
He added that it is important
for scientists and universities to
educate the public about their
research and to inform them about
the strong regulatory research
oversight committee.
Smith echoed Goldman's words
and said that having the Human
Pluripotent Stem Cell Research
Oversight Committee, a unified
oversight committee for all the
research institutions in Michigan,
enables scientists to be "on the
same page."
Brenner said the conference
proved that stem cell researchers
from across the state were collabo-
rating and not competing.
"I don't feel that we're compet-
ing," she said. "I think that we're
actually happy that we have each
other in many ways."
The researchers will reconvene
in a few months at MSU to hold the
second conference.

Fifth-grade students from Chapelle Elementary school perform "Whatever You Like" by T.I. at the 14th annual African
American Festival held in downtown Ann Arbor. Teacher Jason Malloy said the students would practice every day before

Grimes added that he expects

Munson said that the College of

He added that students studying
these fields, in addition to the field
of Energy Systems Engineering,
will have no difficulty finding a job

Phoenix takes flight

French band leaps

popularity
By ARTHUR VELEZ
For the Daily
When The Strokes released
their debut album Is This It (2001),
it was met with a
wave of zealous
critical acclaim.
The explanation -n
for the record's
success is multi- Wolfgang

mental cohesion
that seeped from
every song on the album. Often
times, the band was so locked in

to distinguish synthesized record-
ings from live instruments.
In a similar vein of calculated
pop music is French electro-pop
outfit Phoenix. With their fourth
studio album Wolfgang Amadeus
Phoenix, the Parisians distance
themselves from the garage and
strut toward the club. The band's
complete and thorough songwrit-
inghas brought them to a Strokes-
like musical status, gaining equal
respect from hipsters and the
mainstream alike.
Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is
essentially split into two halves,
each showcasing a different musi-
cal mindset. The album opens
with a trio of extremely appeal-

ing tracks, marked by angular
guitar lines, syncopated drum-
ming and singer Thomas Mars's
soaring tenor. The pop sensibili-
ties embedded in the synth-heavy
single "1901" exemplify the band's
impeccable songwriting ability.
Dividing the two halves is the
mountainous "Love Like A Sunset,"
an eight-minute epic that sets the
stage for the more eclectic second
half of the disc. Instrumentation is
the backbone of the album, a qual-
ity reminiscent of The Strokes's
tight sound. Instead of depending
on a single hook or featured instru-
ment, each track seems to have
been meticulously written, with
intricate and indispensable parts
delegated to every instrument.
When a foreign band attempts to
write lyrics outside of their native
tongue, it often results in a mun-
dane, obvious and less-than-pleas-
ing English cadence. With this in
mind, Mars uses literate words
that are astonishing in their subtle
beauty, reminding the listener that
English is the language of pure pop.
This is vigorously displayed on the
driving "Countdown (Sick For The
Big Sun)," as Mars asks "Do you

Apparently this French band didn't know "Knock 'em dead" is just an expression.

Tonight' has a new, pale face

BY ERIC CHIU
DailyArts Writer
When NBC announced that Conan
O'Brien would be taking over "The Tonight
Show" back in 2004, most of the buzz
surrounding the move
involved whether or not he ** *
could actually pull it off.
Since being chosen TheTonight

an audience accustomed

that O'Brien has officially taken the reins of
"The Tonight Show," it'saclear that he could

tions.

that's hardly a bad thing. O'Brien has been

on the air for more than a decade, and so far
"The Tonight Show" has relied heavily on
the same fine-tuned combination of mono-
logues, traditional interviews and musical
guests, along with sketch material and pre-

taped segments.
These segments, which
showed O'Brieninavarietyof
different situations outside of
the studio, were always great
on "Late Night" - one of the
most memorable had Conan
playing in an old-time base-
ball league - and on "The
Tonight Show," they're just
as strong. These segments
work especially well thanks
to O'Brien's consummate
showmanship and ability to
riff on whatever ridiculous
scenarios he faces.
So far, "The Tonight
Show" has gotten a lot of
mileage from the fact that
O'Brien has switched coasts.
In the first episode, he was
shown sitting in the rafters
during a Los Angeles Lakers
game and, later, guiding a
tram tour in Universal Stu-
dios. to addition to cracking
a variety of jokes at the tour's
expense, O'Brien has the
tram driven through down- supremely co
town LA and buys the whole
tour group things from a 99-cent store. As
good as the pretaped segments were during
"Late Night," the show's new locale helps
keep them fresh.
Being a late-night talk show, "The
Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien" adheres
to the genre's tropes. At this point, the topi-
cal monologue and celebrity interviews
are essentially relics of a bygone era. But
O'Brien's irreverent approach toward these
usual talk show conventions carries over to
"The Tonight Show."
The first two episodes featured Tom
Hanks ("Angels & Demons") being struck by

a giant meteor and Will Ferrell ("Land of the
Lost") entering the set perched on a throne.
While it's hard to tell whether or not it's just
the show pulling out all the stops during its
first week, having "The Tonight Show" open
to such surrealist humor is a nice change
from Leno's straightforward jokes.
One minor pitfall of the show- is Andy
Richter ("Andy Barker, P.I."), O'Brien's side-
kick on "Late Night" until 2000. He now
works as the announcer for the "Tonight
Show," but the show doesn't seem to know
what to do with him just yet. The rapport
between Richter and O'Brien is familiar

and regularly funny, but after eight years
apart, there's not yet a sense that the two
are entirely comfortable working together
again.
Still, that hiccup is more of a growing pain
rather than inexperience, and as O'Brien's
time on "Late Night" showed, he's more
than capable of overcoming such shortcom-
ings. Since O'Brien came into the public eye,
he's grown into a more than capable host.
And after taking on "The Tonight Show"
with such a strong start, it's safe to say that
O'Brien and "The Tonight Show" will defi-
nitely be around for a while.

Grady trades court for field

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Writer
Kelvin Grady may have left the
men's basketball team, but he didn't
go very far.
An Athletic Department spokes-
person confirmed Thursday that
the former Michigan men's bas-
ketball point guard has joined the
football team and is working out in
the Wolverines' summer condition-
ing program. Grady played two sea-
sons under Michigan coach John
Beilein and will have three years of
remaining eligibility.
The Grand Rapids native earned
all-state honors as a senior at East
Grand Rapids with over 2,000
yards and 28 touchdowns, and
would likely play slot receiver
under Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez. The Wolverines have avail-
able scholarships, and the quick,
able-bodied former point guard
could fit in well with Rodriguez's
system. Or could he? Check out our
breakdown and decide for yourself.
THE GOOD
ALWAYS THE PLAN
When Grady verbally committed
to Michigan under former men's
basketball coach Tommy Amaker
on Jan. 30, 2006, Grady wasn't just
signing a one-way ticket.
But after garnering all-state
honors on the gridiron his junior
year of high school with 1,716 yards
and 19 touchdowns, his verbal sig-
nature was loaded.
"Before, when you asked me if I
wanted to play basketball or foot-
ball, I said, 'Basketball, no ques-
tion,' " Grady told the Grand Rapids
Press in 2006. "Then came foot-
ball season, and I had fun, and I
thought, 'Maybe I would like to do
this, too.'
"Italkedaboutthiswith(football

coach Lloyd) Carr and (basketball
coach Tommy) Amaker, and they
are both down with it. So I decided
to do it. It is a great opportunity for
me to do it. I feel like I have been
doing both sports my whole life,
why not in college, too?"
Of course, Grady ended up
focusing solely on basketball, but
Rodriguez can't complain about
a guy who intended to be the first
to play football and basketball for
Michigan since Tai Streets did in
1996-97.
WATCH ME RUN
Slot receivers who excel in a
spread offense often have a knack
for making things happen in open
space. Sophomore Martavious
Odoms will likely be the top slot
receiver in Michigan's home opener
on Sept. 5, but Grady has the talent
to potentially challenge Odoms.
Although he sat on the bench
for the latter half of the Wolver-
ines' best season in more than a
decade, Grady's best attribute was
his speed.
Breaking defensive traps and
opponents' full-court pressure
came naturally to Grady. After the
Wolverines beat Minnesota 74-62
on Feb.19, Grady was asked what he
thought of the Gophers' full-court
pressure. His answer was clear.
"Oh, I love it," Grady said. "That's
when I smile."
TH ENOT-SO-GOOD
MESHING WITH RICHROD
We've all heard at length how
difficult it is to master Rodriguez's
spread offense in the first season, .
and the Wolverines have last sea-
son's 3-9 record to prove it. Will
Grady skip that transition period?
History says probably not.
As a freshman, Grady struggled
to learn Beilein's system - evi-

denced by his turnovers and poor
shot selection. And even with a
year under his belt, Grady never
developed into a consistent point
guard. Beilein put him in the start-
ing lineup for eight straight games
(beginning with his uplifting per-
formance in Bloomington), but
after that his minutes dwindled
significantly.
Grady may struggle initially,
but having experienced receivers
like Odoms nearby could make the
transition a little easier.
IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY
Grady will have to deal with his
transition to the Big House in the
fall, but his older brother could be
dealing with bigger problems.
Last month, a Wyoming District
court judge jailed Kevin Grady, a
fifth-year senior tailback, for seven
days for ,a probation violation.
Grady was serving probation due
to a drunk driving conviction last
July.
Grady paid his court fines but
otherwise, "did none of those
things," said Chris Kittman, a court
administrator for the Wyoming
District.
Grady served five days last
month, and his status with the
team is still uncertain. But accord-
ing to his father, the accusations of
violating his probation are false.
"Those are not correct - those
accusations are not - that he did
not fulfill any of his obligations,"
Kevin Grady Sr. told WTKA 1050
on May 28. "He had to have it done
before his probation was done in
July, and Kevin did complete three-
fourths of it. Those accusations are
not right."
Before Kelvin decided to offi-
cially try his hand on the gridiron,
the Grady family drama was epic

notching a 5-2 record during that
stretch.
"(The trip) was a great experience
for us," Michigan coach Mark Rosen
said. "A couple natches were close, a
couple we lost, and a couple matches
we won easily, which is kind of what
we were looking for out of the trip."
After playing five matches in the
first five days, the team got some
much-needed rest before heading to
Saquarema, Brazil.
Saquarema is the home to the
Brazilian National Team training
center, with four state-of-the-art
gymnasiums at its disposal.
"It's built just for volleyball,"
Rosen said. "We're sitting in this

too significant for multiple Gra-
dys in the Big House.
IF HE WASN'T A POINT GUARD...
Kelvin Grady would be a foot-

"You're like, 'Wow, this is pretty
special.'"
Michigan took on Saquarema's
Junior National Team, which
Rosen said was the favorite to win
the Junior Championships in July,
accordingto Rosen.
Just a week prior, National Cham-
pion Penn State squared off against
the same team, defeating them in
two five-set matches. Rosen knew it
would be a great tune-up for a team
that is still looking to get over the
humpthatseparatesitfromtheupper
tier of the Big Ten Conference.
The Wolverines eventually lost
both matches but held their own
against one of the best Junior
National teams in the world.
Despite the losses atthe end of the
trip, Rosen said the trip was a success
overall. His players traveled to an
unfamiliar place where they didn't
know the language or culture but
ball player. Right?
Not exactly.
When Grady was asked on the
John Beilein radio show in Janu-
ary what sport he would play at
Michigan if he weren't playing bas-
ketball, Grady swiftly answered,
"Baseball."
At the time, Grady had become
a semi-consistent starter and

became an even tighter-knit group
over those 12 days. In that time, Paz
became the official translator of
the team and made her teammates'
experience a little better because of
her knowledge of the country.
"There's that uncomfortable part
of it that brings you closer together,"
Rosen said.
The trip could be what Michigan
needs to push itself into Big Ten
title contention next year. Purdue
and Illinois traveled to internation-
al destinations in previous years,
with noticeable improvement in the
team's performance in the following
season. But Rosen knows just going
onateamtripdoesn'tmeananything
unless his team is prepared mentally
and physically for the entire season.
""Every indication I have of when
we left (Brazil) is that they're jacked
up and ready to come back raring at
it," Rosen said.
nobody suspected that he would be
donning anything but baggy maize
shorts the following season.
Realistically, the baseball com-
ment isn't worth reading in to.
Maybe Grady just wanted to liven
up the conversation. Whatever
the reason, Grady has the tools
to excel with a new uniform and
coach.
