can't imagine most people
would be able to answer imme-
diately when asked: "What was.
the most exciting weekend of your
life?" In fact, I'm not sure many
people have such a weekend, the
one you'll never forget. But seri-
ously, shut up about that one time
at whatever camp you went to in
high school. Nobody cares that
you drank beer from insert-piece-
of-equipment-here. I'm talking
about pure adrenaline-pumping,
stomach-heaving, roller coaster-
like madness. And for me, the
weekend of Sept. 10 and 11 of last
month was one that will live in
both fame and infamy. That Sat-
urday, the Michigan Wolverines
pulled off one of the most nerve-
wracking comebacks in the his-
tory of college football and that
Sunday, I was hit by a car.
Let me explain first and fore-
most that it was the burrito's
fault. It's very important for me
to get that straight. I could tell
you the culpability of each person

involved, as there's some degree of
blame that could be levied on me,
the driver and my housemate (who
shall remain unnamed in dis-
grace). However, to remain non-
accusing, it's safest to condemn
the burrito because burritos typi-
cally can't yell back. You see, that
Sunday I had very modest plans. I
would watch the Steelers play the
Ravens until 4 p.m., when I had
an important meeting to attend.
Other than that, I had cleared my
schedule, so when the unnamed
housemate inquired if I would go
with him to grab a burrito, I fate-
fully obliged. I'm a sucker for bur-
ritos.
I must also disclose that from
where I live, I have to cross State
Street at the five-way intersec-
tion with Packard Street. As I
only had about an hour until my
meeting, I was in a bit of a hurry.
As we approached the crosswalk
running from east to west on
State Street, I noticed there was
five seconds left during which we

could safely cross. Or so I thought, ter is getti

I'd admit it in person, but maybe I
was wondering if my burrito was
in jeopardy too. Don't judge.
It was all over in a matter of
seconds, but the aftermath last-
ed much longer. I immediately
picked myself - and my flip-flops
which had mysteriously flown
off - up and limped to the side-
walk. Though I was miraculously
unhurt, I was pretty pissed. I
hadn't broken a bone in my entire
life, and my foot was swelling
large enough to put that streak in
danger. I was told to sit down and
was examined by a passing doc-
tor. Someone eventually called
the police and an ambulance, and
even a fire truck, but only because
the law requires them to respond.
I got off lucky enough for the
doctor to prescribe a sprained
ankle that would only require
crutches for a few days. Add to
that my unbroken bone streak,
and everything turned out
alright. Actually, scratch that.
The driver, who also shall remain
nameless, never uttered a word
of apology. Though considering
I broke his windshield and his
side-mirror while his car broke
nothing of mine, I'm not too hung
up about it.

STUDY ABROAD
From Page 5C
ens, stray dogs roamed the streets
and houses were packed on top of
each other. Her location was also
five minutes away from the Gree-.
cian protests this summer, giving
her insight into the struggle.
"We got to walk through that
a lot and we got to see tear gas,
riot police, fire bombs, things like
that and just to see the Greek peo-
ple come together," she said.
The fellowship of the Greek
people, coming together to orga-
nize black outs and taxi strikes,
also contributed to Cooper's
desire to travel abroad again and
learn more about the world.
"It definitely just made me
realize how many different types
of cultures that are out there that
I've never experienced and that I

want to," she said.
Tn the School of Art & Design,
students are required to com-
plete a three-week international
experience in the form of a for-
credit or not-for-credit program,
an internship or a volunteering
program.
The requirement is in place
because the faculty has seen that
study abroad truly helps students
in terms of their personal growth,
according to Joe Trumpey, an
associate professor of art in the
School of Art & Design.
"We expect students to come
out of the experience a better
person with these new ideas of
self-confidence, independence,
resourcefulness, flexibility, prob-
lem-solving," Trumpey said.
Studying abroad also helps stu-
dents' art, Trumpey said, whether
they gain inspiration from gothic
cathedrals, cutting-edge art in

China or traditional African art.
"It's the idea of creative
insights, being able to understand
globalization in a new way and
go out and find something that
you're inspired by," Trumpey
said. "Finding your voice is a big
part of your development as an
artist and as a leader."
Art & Design senior Ellen Rutt
studied abroad in the small col-
lege town of Loughborough, Eng-
land, filling three sketchbooks
with inspiration for her special-
ization in graphic art and illus-
tration.
As she traveled around the
country and the continent from
February to June last year, Rutt
said she drew inspiration from
ancient English ruins as well as
the modern architecture of Lon-
don.
"Some of the styles in design
and art are a little bit different
and it certainly influenced my

art," Rutt said.
While Rutt found inspiration
outside the classroom, inthe insti-
tution itself, class occurred only a
few times a week and professors
only helped to guide assignments
when directly approached.
"(In Ann Arbor) I'm in painting
class six hours a week, and there,
I would be assigned a painting
and I could work on it whenever
I choose," she said.
Trumpey said the degree of
independence and less commu-
nication with faculty is common
at many of the art schools abroad.
But he added that all the pro-
grams are approved by University
faculty and thus the programs
are, "comparable not identical."
"It's not going to be exactly as
we have here, which is part of the
value of the contrast," Trumpey
said.
Though assignments could be
completed as desired and meet-

ings with professors arranged
only if needed, Rutt said the
experience helped her grow as a
person and as an artist.
"I think it was really good to be
tested on my own level of moti-
vation and self-discipline," Rutt
said.
Because of this personal
growth, Rutt said she appreciates
the Art & Design requirement as
a way to broaden her education at
the University.
"To step outside of Ann Arbor
and get another perspective for
even just a moment, that's really,
really important in a well-round-
ed undergraduate education,"

Welcome to the Random
Student Interview,
where the reporter
sometimes wants to talk more
than the subject.
I ran into one other person, this
girl, but she seemed to be in a
big hurry and turned me down
for an interview. Do you think I
should take that personally?
For the interview?
Yeah for the interview, but do
you think that's reflective of
like -
I would not take that personally,
no.
No?
No.
So it's not something I have to
think about beyond -
No, not at all.
Thank you. I know over on
State Street they're having the
State Street Fashion Week. Do
you consider clothes a big ele-
ment in your life?
A big element? No. But an ele-
ment, yes, I think so.
Just an element? Like what do
clothes say about a person, are
they a true reflection of self?
I think they can sometimes
reflect how much a person cares
about appearances, which can
reflect self confidence or how
much they care about what
they're doing.
Absolutely. But it's raining now,

and I'm really worried about my
Burburry raw denim pants. So
that's causing me a great deal
of stress right now. I find that I
can't leave the house sometimes
because I'm worried about my
clothes getting dirty. Do you
think that's, like, an issue?
Yes I think that's an issue. Clothes
are meant to be worn so if you're
not wearing them because of
something that kind of defeats the
purpose.
Oh. But - but - OK, I guess I
see where you're coming from
with that. You know what puts
it in perspective for me is, like,
there are people - our genera-
tion basically - mobilized on
Wall Street. How do you feel
in a general way about those
protests?
Wait. Say that again? How did
this? -
It segued. It was sort of a
nuanced segue to one thing that
puts it all in perspective, that
clothes aren't important, is the
reality of thousands of people
protesting. How do you feel
about those protests and what
they say about our generation?
Well I think that, I mean, I sup-
port the fact that people are
protesting as they feel necessary.
There is something going on
beyond the shallow consumer-
ism that's associated with the era

most of us were brought up in. I
don't think that necessarily has
an effect on how people present
themselves to an extent other
than the fact that with the cur-
rent situation a lot of the people
may not be able to afford to pres-
ent themselves how they wish -
Wait how do you mean?
The protests are based on the idea
that people can't get jobs that -
Oh really?
Or we -
I don't know what the protests
are about. Ijust usually, all I
say is that there are protests
happening, and I try to string
it together in a way that sounds
eloquent and hope people fill in
the blanks for me. So it's about
jobs?
It's about the divide, the wealth
divide between what is gener-
ally considered to be people with
Wall Street jobs or other financial
jobs that kind of make money off
of money and people who do not
have such jobs -
But then what about some-
one like me? I would say I
worked like four weeks to get
the money to get these pants
but they're pants that would
indicate wealth, but I'm not
wealthy - so then what am I?
Uh, someone who's good at bud-
geting their money to get what
they want. One of the objections

to the current protest is that peo-
ple think that people aren't prop-
erly managing their money. It's
not necessarily what I think, but
it is one of the main objections.
Let's just shift radically to one
last subject then I'll let you
go: home maintenance. How
much do you care about general
cleanliness of the house?
I care a lot, I guess. I want my -
there's a difference between being
messy and being dirty. I don't like
things to be dirty, but messy isn't
terrible, if that makes sense.
I have a roommate, his name is
Mike, he's sort of like a domes-
tic cat except that he does house
work. He takes great pleasure
doing the dishes. Do you have
somebody like that around the
house?
I live alone, so if I don't do the
dishes the dishes don't get done.
Oh no.
I've had roommates who are that
way, where they do all the clean-
ing because they want to.
Mike's that way. I'm sure he'd
be very happy to clean wher-
ever you live.
Thanks.
So I can certainly offer his ser-
vices.
Thanks, no thanks.

Over the past century, the University
Library grew to be one of the largest uni-
versity library systems in the world, but
until the Internet came to prominence over
the past two decades, the general func-
tion of a library remained unchanged from
Gray's humble beginnings in the 1830s.
The Internet, however, has radically
altered the way people interact with infor-
mation and redefined the library's place
in academia and society. Thirty years ago,
if a student needed to know the capital of
Mozambique, she would have to go to the
library and ask a reference librarian for
assistance to find out that the capital is
Maputo.
Now, all a student needs to do is run a
Google search on her iPhone and within
30 seconds - and without leaving her bed-
room - she could find out that Maputo has
a population of 1.07 million and that the
average temperature in July is 64 degrees
Fahrenheit.
So while the instantaneous nature of the
Internet has made The United States Postal
Service insignificant (When was the last
time you sent a letter?) and has fostered a
24-hour demand for news and information,
it'd be easy to assume that libraries, at the
University and elsewhere, would also be
victims of the Internet's accessibility and
travel down the same path as Borders Inc.,
CDs and handwritten thank you notes.
But that's not the case.
While it's possible to go through four
years at the University without ever check-
ing out a book, libraries are hardly irrele-
vant. They are evolving, and in some cases
even thriving, in the face of technological
change.
The University Library has taken steps
to move more of its resources online, has
partnered with Google to digitize its col-
lection of books and continues to increase
the number of online databases available to
students and faculty.
Similarly, the School of Information is
training the next generation of informa-
tion professionals with the skills to manage
and preserve information in the age of the
Internet - whether they call themselves
librarians or not, according to School of
Information Dean Jeffrey MacKie-Mason.
"The word 'librarian' is attached to a
building, but the building is neither here
nor there. It's the information services you
provide with the content wherever it might
be," MacKie-Mason said. "And a lot of peo-
ple who specialize in library and informa-
tion services work in organizations that
don't look anything like libraries and aren't
libraries."
The University's Board of Regents char-
tered the School of Information in 1996, but
the school has been educating librarians in
one form or another since it was inaugu-
rated as the Department of Library Science
in 1926.
Thirty-four students were in the first
class to earn degrees from the Depart-
ment of Library Sciences in 1927, and the
next year the department became the third
institution in the country to be accredited

by the American Library Association - an
accreditation it hasn't lost since.
And while the program, its name, the
degrees it offers and the technology it
teaches has changed over the years, the
School of Information's goal has remained
the same, MacKie-Mason said.
"Our mission is to bring together peo-
ple, information and technology in more
valuable ways," MacKie-Mason said. "We
have a very strong commitment to social
improvement and social engagement. That,
in part, has been the mission of library pro-
fessionals for more than 100 years."
Today, the School of Information ranks
number five in U.S. News and World
Report's list of the best graduate library
and information studies programs. Three
hundred and sixty students are currently
enrolled in the Masters of Information Sci-
ence program, the most of any program in
the School of Information.
Every MIS student is required to com-
plete a set of core courses, and each student
chooses at least one specialization of per-
sonal interest. The specializations range
from Library and Information Science,
which trains students to work in tradi-
tional librarian roles, to Human Computer
Interaction, where students learn to design
and navigate computer databases.
Each specialization may be different,
but all students graduate with an ALA-
accredited degree - a necessity for work-
ing in most libraries, accordingto School of
Information Prof. Karen Markey, the LIS
faculty coordinator.
"(Though) the students receive an
accredited library degree, they can spe-
cialize in any number of areas that aren't
strictly, and narrowly, defined within
library information studies," Markey said.
Because of the variety of specializations,
many students ultimately find themselves
working outside the traditional library
framework, Markey said.
Ben Bunnell was one of those students.
Bunnell, who graduated from the Uni-
versity with an MIS degree in 2008, now
works for Google as part of Google Books
Search, which digitizes the collections
of various libraries around the world -
including the University Library.
He acts as a liaison between Google
and the libraries, ensuring the books are
scanned properly without damage and
that the scanned files are then given to the
libraries and uploaded on Google Books.
At the University, Bunnell studied elec-
tronic search and retrieval, making Google
- the world's largest search engine - an
appealing place to work, he said. But now,
in his role with Google Books, Bunnell said
he often acts as a "voice" for the librarians
when talking with his Google coworkers.
"Havinga library degree, havingworked
at the graduate library at Michigan and
knowing a lot of librarians, it's been very
easy for me to develop relationships with
the libraries with whom we work," Bun-
nell said. "I feel like I speak the language
of librarians. I feel like I understand, gen-
erally, their concerns and what they value."

Still, there are students interested in
working in traditional libraries. About 26
percent of 2009 MIS graduates took jobs
in some type of library after finishing their
degree, according to data from the School
of Information Career Services office.
Dean of Libraries Paul Courant said that
while there still is a need for librarians,
especially when students and research-
ers need help finding more nuanced and
detailed information than what is readily
available on Wikipedia or Google.
"Knowing how to find things in an envi-
ronment where there's a lot of information,
but it's confusing, is an extremely valuable
skill," Courant said. "Helping people to
make judgments about the quality of the
information, which is something that used
to be easier when there was not as much
stuff published, is also an extremely valu-
able skill. Someone's got to do that, or else
we'll just have total chaos."
MIS student Ryan Clement said the
School of Information offers courses that
teach students the technical skills they'll
need to be successful.
"Talking to friends who are in other
programs around the country, they'll be
learning things about technology that
pretty much everyone in the LIS program
at Michigan already knows," Clement said.
"There's that focus and that acknowledge-
ment (of technology)."

Clement, who wants to work in an aca-
demic library once he graduates, said mov-
ing forward, libraries will need to continue
to make information more accessible for
researchers.
"Librarians ... (need) to be able to create
things that make it easier, more useful and
more fun for people to get to the content,"
he said.
Similarly, MIS student Ilana Barnes,
who currently works at the Kresge Busi-
ness Administration Library, said the
classes she has taken on database creation
and other online tools allow her to better
serve library patrons.
Barnes said a large part of her job is help-
ing researchers determine what informa-
tion they can find for free through Google,
and what they'll need library resources to
find.
"I see my purpose as knowing how
far certain resources go and knowing
what people will need going into further
research," Barnes said.
As libraries, as institutions and physical
spaces, continue to evolve, the job of the
librarian will continue to remain the same
at heart.
And though Asa Gray couldn't have
imagined what the University Library, or
any library for that matter, has developed
into, the job of a librarian hasn't changed
- as they still remain guides to knowledge.

Though the sidewalks of Ann Arbor
are filled with students rushing to
class during the academic year, 1,975 of
those University students studied abroad
from fall 2009 to summer 2010, accord-
ing to data from the Institute of Interna-
tional Education.
Mark Tessler, vice provost for inter-
national affairs and the Samuel J. Elder-
sveld collegiate professor of political
science, said he believes study abroad is
an important part of any student's aca-
demic career.
Tessler said the University is
expanding its study abroad programs,
reaching out to countries like Egypt
and Israel and looking to place stu-
dents on continents other than
Europe.
President Mary Sue Coleman
also places an emphasis on study
abroad as she deferred her pay
raise this year of 2.75 percent, a
total of $15,678, to scholarships
she and her husband set up to
help students study abroad.
Coleman has also pledged to
donate $1 for every $2 donat-
ed for study abroad as part
of the President's Donor
Challenge for The Student
Global Experience.
Recently, Coleman
announced the creation
of the Third Century
Initiative, a $50 million
program which aims
to further "immersive

learning experiences," including study
abroad, for undergraduates.
With these programs in place, Tessler
said he hopes more students will study
abroad.
Tessler speaks from personal experi-
ence, having studied abroad in Israel and
Tunisia as a student, when he says he
believes the experience is life changing.
"You learn a lot about yourself. You
learn a lot about the rest of the world,"
Tessler said. "I suppose these are kind of
like cliches, but it's true."
And while Tessler acknowledges the
academic caliber of the colleges may not
be as high as the University's, he said it
depends on the students' desire to learn
and the quality of the institution.
"I would say as a general proposition
you don't sacrifice academic quality, but
maximizing the academic excellence of a
program isn't necessarily the only thing
to take in consideration when you make
the choice (between programs)," Tessler
said.
W ith five Spanish classes at the
Universidad de Sevilla and doing
homework during the week, Gill said she
had a schedule that was harder than her
classmates'. But even with the workload,
she spent afternoons at coffee shops with
friends, and the academics of the Univer-
sity seemed far away.
"It wasn't the same at all. It was less
work," Gill said.
Beyond academics, Gill said the pro-
gram was more about the experience of
living in Spain, absorbing Spanish cul-
ture, speaking the language and under-
standing the Spanish education system
- where the true test of a course is a
20-page paper due the last day in lieu of
mandatory attendance.
In addition to an increased proficiency
in Spanish and a newfound interest in an
international career, Gill said she also
grew more independent - when a train
ticket almost left her stranded in
Rome.
"You really have to
rely on yourself.
When some-
thing

goes wrong, you can't call up your
mom," Gill said.
For language concentrators like
Gill, Alejandro Herrero-Olaizola,
a Spanish professor and associate
chair of the romance languages
and literature department, said he
believes study-abroad is essential
for proficiency and for furthering
student learning.
"The one thing is to be in a class-
room setting at the (University),
which will give you a lot of knowl-
edge and sort of preparing you for
being abroad and so forth. But the
experience I think is really impor-
tant to put that to the test,"Herrero-
Olaizola said.
Herrero-Olaizola added that
because the language curriculum
now places more of an emphasis on
cultural knowledge, study-abroad
offers a great entryway into the cul-
ture.
"We like the idea of proficiency,
not only linguistic but cultural pro-
ficiency as well," he said. "The two
go together, because you can't just
learn the language in a vacuum. So
we encourage our students to go
to find this cultural and linguistic
immersion say in France or Spain."
With the ideal mixture of culture
and language, Herrero-Olaizola
believes going abroad as a 20-year-
old is the "right time" in life,
because of the way the experience
shapes students' understanding of
the world.
"I think going in your 20s is good
for the kind of exposure you have
to different people, different cul-
tures and also for forcing you to
be in a position to dealing with the
unknown, the unexpected ... " he
said.
A he sat at his desk, LSA senior
avid Frankel's classroom tilt-
ed, rocking back and forth, as each
ocean wave brought students' heads
closer to their desks, lulling them to
sleep.
In his moving classroom, Frankel
was one of the 14 University stu-
dents participating in Semester at
Sea last winter, or what he says is
affectionately known across cam-
puses as a "booze cruise."
However, Frankel
emphasized that
the boat com-

plete with housekeeping services, a
beauty salon and swimming pool, is
not actually a booze cruise. But with
five-credits that amount to 22 total
days of class from January to April,
he acknowledges that his education
took place on shore.
"I would say the majority of the
learning experience took place in
the countries and not in the class-
room," Frankel said.
Traveling across the world from
the Bahamas to Ghana to Singapore,
Frankel said the ship would dock
at each country, and then students
were on their own to explore.
"It was literally like they dropped
you off (and said), 'be back on the
boat by this time on this date or
we're leaving without you,'"he said.
In the countries he visited, Fran-
kel said he learned valuable lessons
from tour guides showing him the
poverty in India and by seeing the
resilience of the people in face of
despair.
"It was more eye-opening than
a textbook could ever teach," Fran-
kel said. "I definitely feel like after
seeing some of these things it puts
everything bad at home into per-
spective."
On the ship filled with about
700 professors and their families,
college students aboard the ship
and adult students from around
the world, Frankel said he gained
perspective himself, as he, a Jew,
became good friends with a Muslim
girl from Jordan.
And as Frankel learned and ulti-
mately decided to pursue an inter-
national career, he said he thinks
Semester at Sea was the right choice
for a study abroad program.
"I would never regret missing out
on an experience (in Ann Arbor)
because I think I learned more in
one semester than I have in my
entire life," he said.
A t the University, the Center for
-.Global and Inter-
cultural Study admin-
isters 100 study abroad
programs in 40 coun-
tries. The center offers
the traditional study
abroad experience
through the Michigan
Global Academic Pro-
grams, Spring or Sum-

mer Language
Study and two facul-
ty-led programs of the
Global Intercultural
Experience for Under-
graduates and Global
Course Connections.
In the GCC program,
students take an on-campus
course and later take a two to
three week trip abroad that offers
an intimate view of a country. A
Russian course may culminate in a
trip where the professor takes stu-
dents to remote Russian villages.
"It's an opportunity you can't
ever get as a tourist," said Nicole
Bonomini, communications coordi-
nator for CGIS.
For pre-med, Nursing or Engi-
neering students who don't have
time in their course schedule for tra-
ditional study abroad, there's GIEU.
With this program, Dennis Beste,
an intercultural programs advisor,
said students can apply their learn-
ing to real world situations.
"We want to offer programs that
kind of cater to them and their inter-
ests and will also be beneficial in the
long run," Beste said. "They'll get
this international experience, and it
won't just be going to Italy and eat-
ing a bunch of spaghetti, they'll also
be going to China and doing some
engineeringwork."
By studying HIV and AIDS in
Zambia or transportation studies in
China, Beste said students in GIEU
programs are also adding valuable
skills to their resume.
"Everybody wants to do some-
thing abroad and that's really a way
to catch head-hunters' attention,"
Beste said. "A way to set yourself
apart from the rest of the appli-
cants."
But during any study abroad pro-
gram, Patrick Morgan, program
assistant at the Center, said stu-
dents learn time management and

improve study and communication
skills.
"You get to see other ways of
studying and engaging yourself in a
subject ina way you haven't thought
about it before," Morgan said.
And by navigating the often
vastly different class structures
and overcoming problems like navi-
gating a city in a foreign language,
Morgan said students are prepared
for life post-graduation.
"The way these classes are struc-
tured it's almost like the way real
life is structured," Morgan said.
"Things come at you that you don't
expect, and it's unpredictable. You
really have to take a risk and go out
there to succeed."
Tn the Greek capital of Athens,
the steps to her classroom were
already well-worn by generations of
famous scholars and philosophers,
as LSA senior Caitie Cooper got her
humanities credits out of the way
among ancient columns and stone
sculptures.
Though she's a neuroscience
major, Cooper said she was pleasant-
ly surprised to find that she enjoyed
humanities, when they were posi-

tioned
against the
backdrop of an ancient
empire.
"Actually being there and going
on site was a completely different
experience than sitting in a class-
room and seeing pictures of these
things," Cooper said.
With five days of classes during
the first section of the trip and seven
days during the second section,
Cooper said the classes focused on
the history of the architecture of
the Grecian sites. But grades didn't
matter in comparison to the time
spent outside the classroom.
"I think it was easier in the sense
of they don't grade as hard, and it
was more focused on us learning
about the experience as we were
there rather than just grade-based,"
Cooper said.
As she walked past white-washed
houses on the island of Santorini,
which she says is "the most beauti-
ful place I've ever seen," explored
the Peloponesse peninsula and saw
the revered site of Olympia, where
the Romans of yore held the Olym-
pics, Cooper said she learned more
than she would have if she had taken
classes counting toward her major.
"I feel like if I would've done sci-
ence classes there, I wouldn't have
come away with a better under-
standing of the culture that I did,"
Cooper said. "I think I would've
been too immersed in studying,
whereas this class I got to explore
those things while learning about
it."
