Five additional 
school districts 

could offer tuition 

scholarships

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan state legislators are 

pushing to expand a program that 
currently provides free under-

graduate college tuition to certain 
students in 10 of the state’s school 
districts.

Senate Bill 0539, which passed 

the state Senate last week, would 
allow for the establishment of 
more “promise zones” in the 
state of Michigan. The zones are 
modeled after the Kalamazoo 
Promise, which guarantees schol-
arships at in-state public colleges 
to students in Kalamazoo who 
have been enrolled in the school 
district for a set number of years.

Established in 2005, the pro-

gram was the first of its kind in 
the United States. Current legis-
lation only allows for 10 promise 
zones in the state of Michigan. 
The bill proposes increasing the 
maximum number to 15. There 
are 10 current promise zone dis-
tricts in the state, which include 
Baldwin 
Community 
Schools, 

Battle Creek Public Schools, 
Detroit Public Schools, Jack-
son Public Schools, the Lansing 
School District, the School Dis-

trict of the City of Pontiac and the 
Saginaw School District.

Promise scholarships cover 

tuition 
costs 
beyond 
federal 

financial 
aid 
awards. 
Those 

scholarships are funded through 
private contributions and a mech-
anism called tax capture — in 
which the promise zone captures 
some of the growth in the State 
Education Tax.

The amount of tuition cover-

age students receive through 
the Kalamazoo Promise var-

ies based on how long they have 
been enrolled in school in the dis-
trict. For example, students who 
attended kindergarten through 
senior year in Kalamazoo Pub-
lic Schools receive 100 percent 
tuition coverage, while students 
who attended from only sopho-
more year on are not eligible 
for any coverage. On top of the 
enrollment requirements, stu-
dents must maintain a 2.0 average 
GPA while in college.

State allocates 
funding for off-
campus sexual 

assault prevention

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Gov. Rick Snyder’s admin-

istration awarded $500,000 
on Thursday to fund sexual 
assault prevention initiatives 
at universities across the state. 
The University will receive 
$20,000 to fund “Raise the 
Bar,” a new program to train 
staff at Ann Arbor bars to 
intervene in situations that 
may result in sexual assault.

The University is working 

alongside Wolverine Wellness 
and the Ann Arbor Campus 
Community Coalition, a local 
group dedicated to reducing 
alcohol-related harm, to train 
local business owners to rec-
ognize and successfully inter-
vene in harmful situations.

“We are really excited about 

this project because we are 
taking our bystander inter-
vention efforts off of cam-
pus and into the community 
where often the trajectory of 
harm begins,” said Holly Rid-
er-Milkovich, director of the 
University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Thursday’s session 

will also focus 

on deer cull plan, 

sustainability

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

will meet Thursday to consider 
resolutions on several topics, 
including a complaint related to 
the University fraternity Alpha 
Sigma Phi, a deer cull, the city’s 
energy and sustainability and the 
purchase of vehicles for the Ann 
Arbor Fire Department.

Possible investigation of fra-

ternity nuisance complaints

Council will vote on wheth-

er to approve a resolution that 
would permit City Attorney Ste-
phen Postema to investigate nui-
sance complaints at Alpha Sigma 
Phi’s fraternity house on 920 
Baldwin Ave.

The resolution is sponsored by 

Councilmember Stephen Kunsel-
man (D–Ward 3). On Wednesday, 
Kunselman told the Daily he 
wouldn’t comment on the issue 
until Thursday’s meeting.

Resolution to allow the posses-

sion and discharge of weapons in 
public places for deer cull

The council will also address 

the city’s deer management pro-
gram Thursday night, as the 
representatives will vote on a 
resolution to allow a temporary 
moratorium on Chapter 115 of the 
city code. The chapter prohibits 
the possession and discharge of 
weapons in public places, and a 
temporary moratorium would 
allow a deer cull in Wards 1 and 2 
of Ann Arbor this winter.

The cull would be carried out 

“at night with noise-suppressed 
firearms using trained person-
nel with experience in conduct-
ing a cull in an urban setting,” 
according to Thursday’s meeting 
agenda.

At 20th annual 

Waggoner lecture, 

president talks 

campus misconduct

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

University President Mark 

Schlissel delivered the 20th 

Annual Raymond W. Waggoner 
Lectureship on Ethics and Val-
ues in Medicine on Thursday. 
The topic he chose to discuss: 
sexual misconduct.

An audience of medical pro-

fessionals and a handful of stu-
dents crowded the University 
Hospital’s Ford Auditorium for 
the lecture, named for the late 
Raymond Waggoner, professor 
emeritus and chairman of the 
Department of Psychiatry.

Schlissel’s 
lecture, 
titled 

“Making U-M Safer for Stu-
dents: Confronting the Chal-
lenge of Sexual Misconduct,” 
mainly focused on the obstacles 
facing the investigation of sexual 
assault on campus.

“Although there are ethics in 

all aspects of science, I’ve decid-
ed to speak about a topic that I’ve 
been dealing with a lot as a Uni-
versity president,” he said. “It 

Research could pave

treatments

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

When 
cancer 
cells 
and 

immune T-cells compete for 
glucose, more commonly known 
as sugar, cancer cells will win, 
according to new University 
research. According to the study, 
which was released Tuesday, the 
competition results in unhealthy 
immune system T-cells that are 
unable to fight the cancer.

Conducted 
by 
researchers 

from the University’s Medical 
School, the study focused on 
the human cancer microenvi-
ronment, which holds the key 
to understanding the immune 
system’s response to cancer-
ous tumors and the patient’s 
response to therapy.

Immunotherapy, 
a 
type 

of therapy that has been 
researched 
extensively 
in 

recent years and aims to 
employ the body’s immune sys-
tem to fight off some cancers, 
was a focus of the research led 
by Weiping Zou, the Univer-
sity’s Charles B. de Nancrede 
professor of surgery, immunol-
ogy and biology and the direc-
tor of translational research.

Zou said the fields in which 

the study was based — tumor 
biology and immunotherapy — 
are difficult to work in because 
only a fraction of patients 
respond to the treatment and 
the likelihood of response var-
ies based on a patient’s exist-
ing T-cell count.

“T-cells are the soldiers in 

the immune system,” Zou said. 
“The T-cells kill the tumors, 
so the T-cells are important. 
But the T-cells must be in the 
tumor microenvironment, and 
the T-cells must be also func-
tional in the tumor microen-
vironment. That’s the problem 
we have been working on for 
many years.”

Zou said the tumor microen-

vironment and the tumor itself 
may affect the T-cells because 
they all share the same micro-
environment.

“What we saw is that it turns 

out the T-cells and the tumor 
cells are actually competing 
for glucose in the microen-
vironment,” Zou said. “The 
T-cells are not able to com-
pete efficiently with the tumor 
cells because the tumor cells … 
could be resistant to the harsh 
environment. Therefore, this 
hurts the T-cells. The T-cells 
are not able to be fully func-
tional, and they are not able to 
kill the tumor in an efficient 
manner.”

According to Zou, the study 

ultimately concluded that cur-
rent immunotherapy clinical 
trials with PD-L1 and PD-1 

blockade, which are immuno-
therapy-based inhibitors, indi-
cate that tumors with a high 
number of T-cells were more 
responsive to these immuno-
therapy-based inhibitors than 
tumors with a lower number of 
T-cells.

Though tumor cells are 

killed during chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy, a num-
ber of healthy cells are also 
killed, Zou said. However, in 
the case of immunotherapy, 
the tumor cells are selectively 
killed, rather than employing 
a treatment that could also 
potentially damage cells in the 
rest of the body, as is common 
in chemotherapy.

Additionally, the side effects 

of immunotherapy are more 
manageable and quite mini-
mal. Some patients could be 
cured of cancer, and others 
will have a long-term positive 
response.

“If the patient is not respon-

sive, it means they have very 
few T-cells in the tumor,” Zou 
said. “And even if they have 
T-cells, the T-cells may not be 
functional. One reason may be 
they don’t have sufficient sugar 
because of the competition 
between tumor and T-cells. So 
in that case, we have two ways 
to reprogram it.”

The first is to reprogram the 

T-cells to ensure they move 
into the tumor. Once they’re 
inside, the second aim is to 
make sure they are resistant to 
the harsh tumor environment.

According to Zou, while 

researchers might not be able 
to fix the problem immediate-
ly, they hope the new knowl-
edge may help drive the search 
for a solution. Educational 
institutions and many phar-
maceutical companies are now 
working on finding methods to 
reprogram the T-cells, and the 
research continues to evolve.

“The strategy right now is 

combination,” Zou said. “That 
means you use different ways, 
you combine them together. 
For example, we know now 

that the PD-1 blockade could 
work. But for some patients, 
we don’t see T-cells … So before 
we do this therapy, we can do 
something else, to increase the 
T-cells in the tumor.”

Zou said much of what he 

and his colleagues discuss is 
why some patients are respon-
sive and some other are not.

Pavan Reddy, professor of 

translational 
oncology 
and 

internal medicine, works as a 
tumor immunologist and phy-
sician scientist at the Univer-
sity familiar with this type of 
research.

“The ability to manipulate 

the immune system to get rid 
of cancer is now one of the 
most exciting methods of ther-
apy available,” Reddy said.

T-cells are probably among 

the 
most 
critical 
immune 

cells in the body, specifically 
for eliminating tumor cells, 
Reddy said. However, because 
not all T-cells survive and not 
all are very functional in the 
tumor environment, the paper 
published by Zou and his co-
authors provides fundamental 
insight into potential methods 
to allow the T-cells to become 
functional to kill the cancer 
cells.

“Tumor cells use glucose in 

a unique manner compared to 
normal tissues,” Reddy said. 

Reddy said the research 

shows a surprising but impor-
tant connection between the 
T-cells and their competition 
with cancer cells for glucose. 
He also agreed with Zou, say-
ing the use of immunotherapy 
could present a much more 
precise treatment compared to 
other approaches like chemo-
therapy.

Because it would be difficult 

and impractical to collect data 
on all types of cancers, Reddy 
said, the recent research was 
done specifically with human 
melanoma and ovarian cancer 
samples. However, he said the 
research is likely applicable to 
many other kinds of cancers as 
well.

does to speak to our ethics and our 
system of values, but it has to do 
with how to create campus envi-
ronment that is ideal for learning.”

During the address, Schlissel 

pointed out the importance of stu-
dents feeling safe in their learning 
environment.

“If you feel threatened by sexual 

misconduct, you’re not going to be 
able to learn,” he said. “We won’t 
have an adequate learning envi-
ronment for our children.”

Schlissel spent a large portion 

of the talk relaying the key points 
of the University’s process for 
investigating sexual assault and 
describing how the process creates 
challenges for all parties involved. 
The 
University’s 
approach 
is 

defined as a student disciplinary 
process instead of a criminal one, 
and in 2011, it was changed from 
complaint-driven to investigation-
driven, meaning the University 
must investigate a known episode 
of sexual misconduct.

In addition, Schlissel noted the 

standard of proof for University-
based investigations is based on a 
“preponderance of evidence.”

“If it is more likely than not, 

then the person is found guilty,” 
Schlissel said. “If a ruling is 51 to 
49, the person is found guilty. You 
only need a slight degree of cer-
tainty to adjudicate.”

Phillip 
Margolis, 
professor 

emeritus of psychiatry, introduced 
Schlissel, and noted the President’s 
how his background in medicine 
lends a unique perspective on the 
subject of sexual assault. Schlis-
sel holds a Bachelor of Arts in bio-
chemical sciences from Princeton 
University, and both a medical 
degree and a doctorate in physi-
ological chemistry from Johns 
Hopkins University.

“We need to learn how to 

control, adjudicate and prevent 
aspects of sexual misconduct,” 
Margolis said. “You can’t escape 
this discussion in modern society.”

Throughout the talk, Schlis-

sel repeatedly referenced two 
recent 
campus-wide 
surveys: 

one administered by the Univer-
sity and another national survey 
conductedby the Association of 
American Universities. The Uni-
versity’s survey revealed 11.4 per-
cent of students and 22.5 percent 
of undergraduate females at the 
University reported having experi-
enced some sort of nonconsensual 
sexual behavior at the University.

Women were reported to be 

eight times more likely to be sexu-
ally 
assaulted. 
Undergraduate 

students three times more likely, 
lesbian, gay or bisexual students 
two and a half times, Greek stu-
dents two and a half times, and 
underrepresented minorities two 
times more likely to be sexually 
assaulted then the general popu-
lation. Out of the students who 
responded ‘yes’ to an incident of 
sexual misconduct, 46 percent told 
another person. However, only 3.6 
percent told an official University 
resource.

LSA freshman Kyla Klein had 

a mixed response to the lecture 
overall, saying she felt Schlissel 
relied too heavily on statistics.

“I enjoyed learning about the 

statistics, but I didn’t really see 
anything to go forward from,” she 
said. “I think we have the bodies to 
deal with these issues, but we just 
need more support and resources 
in those bodies.”

Some of the challenges Schlissel 

pointed out included the stigma 
associated with coming forward 
and revealing one’s sexual history, 
the lack of direct witnesses and the 
prevalence of alcohol and binge 
drinking.

The talk touched on the Univer-

sity’s Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center and its his-
tory of sexual misconduct preven-
tion.

“This isn’t a Michigan prob-

lem, but a university-aged student 
problem,” he said. “The University 
has really been on the leading edge 
of concern for students over sexual 
assault.”

At the end of his lecture, Schlis-

sel outlined how, going forward, 
the University needs to improve 
the 
investigation, 
adjudication 

and support processes for sexual 
assault. Specifically, he said he 
wanted to increase the number of 
students coming forward, as well 
as support for survivors on cam-
pus. The University is currently 
garnering input to inform a revi-
sion of the University’s Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy.

“All this is happening in a cul-

ture that I think is very different 
from the one most of us grew up 
in,” he said. “What I am very proud 
of is the University, with its eyes 
wide open, has taken a very honest 
look at itself, and it’s identified its 
problems within itself.”

City Council will also consider 

an amendment to the city’s con-

The amendment would further 

many of the goals set forth in the 
council’s sustainability frame-

energy conservation, sustainable

and engaged community.

Implementing the provisions 

of the amendment would cost the 
city $85,000, a sum that was allo-
cated to the operations and main-
tenance budget when the city’s 
budget for 2016 was approved.

Resolution for purchase of 

vehicles for Fire Department

The council will also a resolu-

tion to approve the purchase of 
three sport utility vehicles.

The city would by the cars from 

the Grand Rapids Berger Chevro-
let for a total of $63,129.

All three of the vehicles would 

be assigned to the Ann Arbor Fire 
Department. More specifically, 
two of the cars will be assigned 
to the assistant fire chiefs so they 
can “respond to emergency scenes 
when necessary,” and “travel to 
and from business meetings and 
work related events,” according to 
the agenda item.

The third car will be used by 

the department’s field opera-
tions unit for “transportation of 
administrative staff … to inves-
tigate and respond to issues that 
arise in the field.”

The city would gift the vehicles 

to their fire department recipients 
in lieu of automobile stipends. For 
that reason, the fire department’s 
budget will fund the purchases.

Bentley Historical 
Library acquires 
papers of former 
Sen. Carl Levin

The 
University’s 
Bentley 

Historical Library announced 
Wednesday that papers from 
the 36-year career of former 
U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D–
Mich.) will be permanently 
housed in its archives.

Levin, who has served six 

terms in the Senate, donated the 
materials, which will include 
legislation, letters, photos and 
memos dating to 1952, the year 
he graduated from Detroit Cen-
tral High School. Levin did 
not seek reelection in 2014 and 
was succeeded by Gary Peters, 
a Democrat from Bloomfield 
Twp.

The historical library cur-

rently preserves records and 
documents from the terms of 
more than a dozen U.S. sena-
tors, 17 members of the U.S. 
House and 31 Michigan gover-
nors. Earlier this year, former 
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D–
Mich.) donated his papers to the 
University. Dingell, whose wife 
Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) now 
represents his former district, 
was the longest serving House 
Representative until his retire-
ment in 2015.

University receives 
$5 million in funds 
for brain research

The University will receive 

$5 million from the Nation-
al 
Science 
Foundation 
for 

brain research, the University 
announced Tuesday. Experts 
in 
sensor 
technology, 
data 

analysis, electronics and neu-
roscience will use the funds 
to research discoveries about 
brain activity at a the single-
neuron level and train inter-
national 
neuroscientists 
and 

engineers.

The grant was awarded under 

the Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education 
program, and will support the 
participation of 55 students and 
researchers in an international 
exchange program.

After completing neurosci-

ence 
and 
neurotechnology 

“boot camps” hosted at the Uni-
versitorty, 40 undergraduate 
students will attend collaborat-
ing institutions to participate 
in summer research projects. 
The grant also allows 15 gradu-
ate students or postdoctoral 
researchers from U.S. labs to 
work in a collaborating lab.

Questions about brain func-

tion will be answered by opto-
electrodes, technology capable 
of 
measuring 
signals 
from 

nerves that influence brain 
activity.

Collaborators in the five-year 

project will include scientists 
and researchers from Singa-
pore, South Korea, New York, 
Puerto Rico, the United King-
dom and Germany.

The project aims to stimu-

late and measure neurons with 
new technology purchased by the 
funding with the hope of improv-
ing the quality of data.

Students’ eligibility and the 

amount of tuition they receive 
varies depending on the prom-
ise zone. Like in Kalamazoo, the 
number of years a student has 
attended school in the district, 
as well as whether or not they 
have achieved a certain GPA, are 
among the factors employed as 
determinants.

Michigan communities with 

a poverty level for families with 
children under the age of 18 that 
meets or exceeds the state aver-
age, can hold a public hearing 
and submit a request to the state 
government for promise zone 
consideration.

The new legislation would not 

change the way promise zones 
are chosen in the state of Michi-
gan, but simply increase their 
number.

State Sen. Goeff Hansen (R–

Hart), who sponsored the leg-
islation, hopes it will increase 

college enrollment in the state of 
Michigan.

“Passage of this legislation 

will increase access to higher 
education opportunities for eli-
gible students across the state,” 
Hansen said in an e-mail to The 
Michigan Daily. “This will be 
another tool for our students to 
be part of a more educated work-
force and be able to compete in a 
global economy.”

For 
context, 
Washtenaw 

County had a poverty rate of 15.4 
percent in 2013 — slightlybelow 
the state average of 16.8 percent, 
meaning it’s likely districts in 
the county would likely qualify 
for promise zone consideration.

When the state program was 

created in 2009, they received 
14 requests to fill 10 slots. Many 
of the promise zones created 
through the state bill after the 
Kalamazoo Promise — such 
as the Baldwin Promise Zone 
— focus on funding two-year 
degrees versus four-year pro-
grams.

Studies on the effects of prom-

ise zones show the program had 
positive impacts on communities 
in regard to the economy and 
district enrollment. A 2007 Cen-
ter for Local, State and Urban 
Policy study through the Univer-
sity was performed too early to 
say definitively that the Kalama-
zoo Promise has had a positive 
impact on the local and state 
economy, but positive indicators 
— such as the likelihood for stu-
dents who go to college in-state 
to remain there post-graduation 
— are noted in the report.

The study found an overall 

increase in enrollment in Kalam-
azoo Public Schools. Further, 
minority enrollment increased 
at a greater rate. The CLOSUP 
study also indicated students 
who participated in the Kalama-
zoo Promise were more likely to 
have college aspirations.

“The researchers concluded 

that the Promise (a) increased 
the likelihood of students apply-
ing to college, (b) increased the 
likelihood of students applying 
to Michigan colleges and uni-

versities, (c) permitted students 
to choose higher-quality post-
secondary institutions and (d) 
increased the likelihood of low-
income students applying to a 
4-year college and decreased 
the likelihood of these students 
applying to a 2-year college,” the 
study says.

Meredith Billings, a doctoral 

candidate in the Center for the 
Study of Higher and Postsec-
ondary Education, is working 
to evaluate promise zones for 
her dissertation. She said her 
research so far coincides with 
many of the findings in the CLO-
SUP study.

“I think the idea of the MI 

promise zones are definitely 
innovative given that they are 
targeted at communities that 
have a higher percentage of 
families living in poverty and 
tend to have lower college-going 
rates than other communities in 
Michigan,” Billings wrote in an 
e-mail to the Daily. “The hope is 
these promise zones will be able 
to foster a college-going culture 

within the local schools and be 
able to revitalize the community 
through increasing the educa-
tion levels of its residents and 
attracting new businesses to the 
area.”

After Michigan voters banned 

the use of affirmative action, 
colleges 
like 
the 
University 

have struggled to enroll under-
represented minority students. 
According to Fall 2015 data from 
the Office of the Registrar, Black 
enrollment at the University is 
4.1 percent. The University has 
recently launched several new 
scholarship programsof their 
own with the aim of enrolling a 
more diverse class of students.

“Passage of this legislation 

will increase access to higher 
education opportunities for eli-
gible students across the state,” 
Hansen wrote. “This will be 
another tool for our students to 
be part of a more educated work-
force and be able to compete in a 
global economy.”

Center.

The grant stems from the gov-

ernor’s Campus Sexual Assault 
Grant Program, an initiative 
designed to help Michigan col-
leges and universities fund addi-
tional sexual assault prevention 
resources. Of the 33 colleges and 
universities that applied for fund-
ing in October, 23 received a por-
tion of the $500,000.

According to a press release, 

the grant aims to change the cul-
ture of sexual assault among col-
lege students. Universities and 
colleges submitted proposals for 
specific projects which fostered 
collaboration, innovative ideas 
and encouraged student involve-
ment.

“In Michigan we have a proven 

track record of working together 
to tackle the tough issues and 
solve problems,” Snyder said in 
the press release. “This funding 
is an important step in working to 
ensure the long-term safety and 
success of our state’s students.”

The University is the second 

school to employ a bar bystander 
intervention program, after the 
University of Iowa. 

“It’s a promising new approach 

and it represents significant new 
efforts in the area,” Rider-Milkov-
ich said. “We are extremely excit-
ed that the selection committee 
chose this project to be funded.”

The University’s satellite cam-

puses in Flint and Dearborn also 
received funding through the 
program — the Dearborn cam-
pus received $38,016 and the Flint 
campus received $29,363.

Remembering, not rationalizing, the Holocaust

REBECCA TARNOPOL | VIEWPOINT

M

y 
grandmother 
was 

always moving. It was in 
this way, and in others, 

that she wasn’t 
(and never pre-
tended to be) a 
“sweet old lady.” 
At 
her 
wake 

almost a year 
ago, someone I 
didn’t know very 
well came up to 
me, patted me 
on the shoulder 
and told me that 
my grandmoth-
er was “such a 
sweet old lady.” As I maintained the 
same sad smile I had worn for the 
past three hours or so, I knew that 
this depiction, though well inten-
tioned, simply wasn’t accurate. Yes, 
she played bridge regularly, didn’t 
really know how to work e-mail and 
always had candy out in Waterford 
crystal bowls in her condo’s liv-
ing room. But once you got to know 
her, she was far from demure, meek 
and unassuming — nothing like the 
“sweet old lady” some people remem-
bered her to be.

My grandmother was surely kind-

hearted and sensitive to her core. 
However, she was also bold, unapolo-
getic and infectiously enthusiastic 
about practically everything she 
devoted time to. To her, one of the 
worst things in life was to be stag-
nant. She regularly volunteered as a 
docent at the Nation American Muse-
um of History, which is a Smithson-
ian institution, and on weekend visits 
with my mother and sisters, she nur-
tured my love for history by telling 
me stories of how she felt when JFK 
was shot and what it was like to live 
during the Cold War, all while briskly 
strolling through exhibits. We had a 
lunch reservation to catch, of course.

She also worked relentlessly to 

continue broadening her horizons 
through books, magazines, news-

papers and movies. Although she’d 
sometimes call me and my cousins 
for help on a particularly “millennial” 
New York Times crossword puzzle 
clue, she always seemed to know more 
about current events and pop culture 
than I did. I vividly remember when 
she broke the news to me that Justin 
Bieber was arrested for drunk driving.

She was always moving, whether 

it was voraciously through books or 
quite literally across the globe. All 
while over the age of 60, she careened 
through Old Delhi in the back of a 
rickshaw, climbed nearly 500 feet 
above ground across the Sydney Har-
bour Bridge, tossed water off a hotel 
balcony onto unsuspecting tourists 
in Florence, observed lions while 
on safari in Botswana, attempted 
to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa 
back in place for a goofy photo and, 
while sitting firmly next to me, sped 
through Denali National Park in the 
back of an off-road Jeep driven by 
my uncle. She was both excited and 
exciting, and being close to her meant 
having the privilege to listen to her 
adventures, stories and advice, all of 
which I eagerly consumed over regu-
lar lunch and dinner dates.

On top of all this, my grandmother 

was one of the most beautiful, ele-
gant and glamorous women I knew. 
She lived and breathed “look good, 
feel good” and refused to succumb to 
most, if not all, old-lady expectations. 
She favored her Stuart Weitzmans 
and Ferragamos over more practical 
orthotics, and always smelled subtly 
of Chanel No. 5. Going grey was sim-
ply not an option, and so she visited 
Andre Chreky, once the hairdresser 
to First Lady Laura Bush, for a regu-
lar cut and dye. Anyone other than 
her grandchildren simply could not, 
and did not, call her “Grandma,” and 
rest assured, she’d kindly (but curtly) 
correct you if you did. And even when 
she eventually became so sick to the 
point where she couldn’t walk more 
than five feet without feeling weak, 

she refused to be seen in public in a 
wheelchair. End of story.

But this glamorous and unapologet-

ic outer shell did not signal a self-cen-
tered and cold core. My grandmother 
was, in fact, endlessly warm and pas-
sionate — about her family, her friends 
and generally life itself. And this was 
despite the sudden and utterly unex-
pected loss of her husband, my grand-
father, at 54. Although I hadn’t been 
born yet, I knew that she’d never even 
fathomed being widow in her 50s, and 
that this cruel reality turned her world 
upside-down. By the time I was old 
enough to fully grasp what had hap-
pened, my grandmother seemed to 
once again possess the world’s most 
positive outlook on life, even when 
hers had been so abruptly interrupted 
by tragedy.

She constantly reminded me to 

keep everything in perspective and 
to remember that this too shall pass; 
her personal story stood as a testa-
ment to this. She was genuinely and 
truly invested in my pursuits, my 
happiness, my health, and when she 
held my hand and asked, “How are 
you doing, dolly?” I knew she wanted 
the real answer — even when it wasn’t 
the easiest thing to hear. She seemed 
to be enthusiastic and engaged in 
nearly everything my cousins and I 
did, and her affinity for white wine 
and board games was only rivaled 
by her love of smiling, laughing and 
rejoicing in the warmth of family.

Although this past year without 

my grandmother hasn’t been the 
easiest, I take solace in the fact that 
every day she stays with me, deeply 
embedded in my own sense of self. 
As I pause to remember her one year 
later, I can almost feel her tapping 
on my shoulder, reminding me not to 
dwell too long. She wants me to keep 
moving through life, just like she did, 
and to never, ever sit still.

“S

i fueras un animal, que animal 
serías?”

“If you were an animal, 

what animal would you 
be?” my GSI in Spanish 
232 asked the class.

Because I take ques-

tions like this seriously, I 
thought it was a bit unfair 
that he was expecting 
us to answer with such 
a limited vocabulary. On 
an average day, I would 
struggle with this ques-
tion in English. On a good 
day, I could name only a handful of animals 
in Spanish. As we went around the room, cats 
and dogs had already been picked a few times 
apiece, and while I liked dogs more, I could 
relate better emotionally to cats. I could not 
make myself pick either.

“Un pato,” I answered. A duck. In the middle 

of Spanish class, I had quacked (bad puns make 
the world a little better). My teacher arched his 
brow, questioning my answer, my sanity.

“Si,” I replied. 
I breathed. I needed the oxygen. Who had I 

become in my life if I was now best compared 
to a duck? What were the redeeming qualities 
of a duck, anyway? They have waterproof feath-
ers and walk in a pseudo-graceful dance. Their 
babies are cute, but most babies are rather ordi-
nary that way. Ducks are not exactly fierce and 
beautiful dwellers of wild habitats. They are 
also, I quote from a friend, “rather messy and 
did not make a good house pet.”

I spent my weekend thinking about ducks. 

I carved one into a pumpkin Friday night, 
drew cartoons of them into the margins of 
my anthropology notes. Ducks trailed behind 
me as I wove through the tables in the din-
ing hall, and their webbed toes stepped into 
puddles after my rain boots did. Though I did 
not yet know the reason, I had to believe there 
were more worthwhile attributes of ducks.

According to the unreliable Internet, ducks 

seem to represent everything from freedom 

to upcoming life transitions. As diverse as 
the results were, adaptability was a common 
theme. Through my irritation at the inconclu-
sive symbolism, I realized this searching for 
an answer was more than glossy green birds 
or plastic yellow bath toys. This was about 
why my feeling of self-worth now depended 
on the worthiness of ducks to be at the fore-
front of my mind. 

Lately, I have been incessantly evaluating 

myself. Needless to say, I did not pass my own 
judgment in the “uses time effectively” category. 
Time, now that I admit it, was at the root of all 
of my self-appointed problems. I spend too much 
time reading. I call my mom way too often. I sleep 
later than I should. I did not fully take advantage 
of a beautiful October. Time is not to be wasted.

As these thoughts began to invade my every-

day, my skepticism of larger life choices also 
became more prevalent. Why am I studying Eng-
lish and anthropology? As of now, I have no clue 
where that will get me in life. Am I wasting four 
years? What makes what I am doing worthwhile? 
Once one questions the very decisions that make 
them who they are, one finds themself stumbling 
further — what makes any attribute or activity 
more worthwhile than another?

Worthwhile (adjective): such as to repay 

one’s time, attention, interest, work, trouble, 
etc. (Thanks, dictionary.com.)

Lately I have been so afraid of time, I have 

been trying to use the dictionary in an effort 
to achieve precision of language. (I have read 
Lois Lowry’s “The Giver,” where they refrain 
from using words like love, yet still I continue.) 
However, this activity is extremely harmful to 
me because I do not spend enough time talking 
as it is. I do not need to focus on clipping the 
hedges around what I say. In fact, I think I need 
to water them. (I do not garden.) Which brings 
me back to the definition of worthwhile — when 
does what I say become or cease to be worth-
while? There is neither specific measurement 
nor unit to measure in. The broadness of the 
definition allows nearly all possibilities, seem-
ingly forcing me to create my own definition.

friend— from ducks to being worthwhile — she 

PAYTON 
LUOKKALA

Earlier this year, I spent a morn-

ing at the senior residence center a 
block away from the high school I 
attended. There, I met Ben, who sat 
alone in the residence’s dining hall. 
Ben had lost much of his memory 
with age, unable to recall such sim-
ple things as what his sons do for a 
living or where his grandchildren 
attend school.

But one thing came up again and 

again in conversation. Ben would 
lift his left wrist, point to the faded 
numbers and recite from memory:

“I was in Auschwitz. My number 

was 138…”

The Holocaust has been a focal 

point of recent politics, between 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu’s statement that Haj 
Amin al-Husseini — one of the first 
major Palestinian leaders — was 
responsible for the “final solution,” 
to Republican presidential candi-
date Ben Carson’s remarks that the 
effects of the Holocaust would have 
been relieved if the Jewish people 
were allowed to have guns. In light 
of these comments, it’s more impor-
tant that we remember the devasta-
tion of the Holocaust than try to 
assign the blame to any ethnic or 
national group. Worse yet is when 
people downplay the significance 
of the genocide by suggesting how 
theoretical situations could have 
alleviated at least some of the suf-
fering faced by the millions of vic-
tims, Jewish or not.

My family was lucky: Three of 

my four grandparents were born 
and raised in the United States, 
and my maternal grandfather and 
his family fled Poland before the 
Nazi regime took over the country. 
Only my Jewish heritage ties me 
to the genocide. But my ties were 
strengthened last May, when I had 
the opportunity to visit the very 
camps that forged experiences so 

horrible that they remain vibrant in 
even the most fractured memories.

Auschwitz-Birkenau 
was 
the 

first camp I visited. My arrival at 
the camp evoked more of a cog-
nitive dissonance than any over-
whelming emotion. It wasn’t until 
I was physically there that I real-
ized nothing I experience now will 
allow me to truly understand the 
circumstances people were dis-
posed to in the camps.

Even the tangible items — the 

rooms filled with an endless sea of 
kitchenware, shoes without own-
ers, human hair collected from vic-
tims — could not and still cannot 
make up for the time that separates 
me from the harrowing reality of 
the camp. Time has claimed the 
barracks and gas chambers that 
populated the massive complex, 
leaving Birkenau mostly in remains. 
Time has removed me from the 
clatter of arriving trains, the shouts 
of German guards, the confusion of 
tongues, the booming of gunshots 
and replaced such wretched noises 
with silence. Time has turned the 
site of war crimes and mass mur-
der into a sort of tourist attraction, 
complete with shops that line the 
way up to the “Arbeit Macht Frei” 
sign in Auschwitz I (and not to 
mention, free Wi-Fi therein).

The next day I visited Chelmno. 

Chelmno, though established for 
the same purpose as Auschwitz, 
was a different world. The entire 
camp consisted of two buildings, 
an establishment especially tiny 
when compared to Auschwitz, yet 
it claimed the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of Jews by way of gas 
trucks. This is the reason Chelmno 
has no visitors: Few people have 
heard of it, since so few people sur-
vived its wrath.

Chelmno’s burial site is a clear-

ing in a forest located a couple miles 

outside of the camp. It too was 
silent, the only visitors being myself 
and my classmates. The scene was 
especially haunting since evidence 
of the Nazis’ crimes pervades the 
area. But the stages of natural suc-
cession have already begun to swal-
low the memorial grounds, weeds 
and grasses growing irreverently 
around the graves.

I realized there that while the 

evidence of the Holocaust glares 
at us today, it may not be there for-
ever, and the prospect of a world 
without survivors began to scare 
me. If I, as a Jew, felt a disconnect 
between the history of the camps 
and the way that history is memo-
rialized, I could only wonder what 
impression the camps make on 
someone who has no connections to 
the atrocity of the Holocaust. Soon 
there will no longer be people like 
Ben, whose faded numbers imply 
stories unspeakable yet invaluable 
to the preservation of history, of 
memory. It’s very possible that in 
20 years, Auschwitz will merely be 
another museum, Chelmno, anoth-
er forest. And with the number of 
misguided comments made about 
the genocide in the last few weeks, 
it’s all the more important to real-
ize the Holocaust may become no 
more than a rhetorical device used 
to vilify another party.

I, therefore, feel a responsibil-

ity not only for myself, but for my 
entire generation — perhaps the 
last generation to have the privilege 
to interact with survivors — to con-
tinue the memory of those who died 
for remaining loyal to the values we 
have freedom to practice today. It’s 
on us to continue this memory so 
the world may never forget the dev-
astation caused by the Holocaust.

T

he World Health Organization released 
a jarring report Oct. 26 that identifies 
processed meat as a group one car-

cinogen — meaning that it 
has a firm link to cancer. 
This finding adds traction 
to the Meatless Monday 
movement, which encour-
ages individuals to not eat 
meat on Mondays in order 
to improve their health and 
to promote environmental 
conservation. On a weekly 
basis, University Dining 
hosts Meatless Mondays 
at East Quad. University 
Dining presents Meatless 
Mondays at East Quad as a 
public health and environmental conservation 
initiative; although altruistic, the fact that stu-
dents attending this dining hall on Mondays do 
not have the freedom to choose whether to eat 
meat or not brings about questions of the role of 
the University in limiting food options.

Meatless Mondays are an example of the 

extension of the University’s public health and 
environmental initiatives in the food realm. 
Other initiatives include choosing Michigan 
farmers for vegetables, fruits, honey and milk 
served in all of the dining halls, with East Quad 
additionally serving meats less than 250 miles 
away from campus. This allows for fresh and 
local ingredients to be served in the dining 
halls, while also reducing the carbon footprint 
that would be created with large transporta-
tion distances. This initiative does not con-
troversially inflict a limitation of choice upon 
students: Yes, students are less likely to have 
honey in their tea from across the Atlantic, but 
having locally grown honey has few drawbacks 
for students if the University can negotiate 
ingredients at a competitive rate that does not 
alter meal plan costs. Furthermore, University 
Dining has paired with a company known as 
Sea to Table that helps the University find sus-
tainable fishery suppliers. Yet again, having fish 
that comes from sustainable and eco-friendly 
suppliers does little to have cause for students 
to object if costs are not significantly increased.

However, Meatless Mondays go much fur-

ther than these other initiatives because meat 
consumption is such an intrinsic and natural 
act for a human to engage in. We are omnivores, 
and although some choose to become vegetari-
ans (5 percent of Americans according to a 2012 

Gallup poll), the vast majority of University stu-
dents and Americans consume meat on a daily 
basis. In fact, the Wall Street Journal calculates 
that the average American adult who consumes 
meat eats about 0.36 pounds of meat a day. Meat 
provides humans with essential proteins and 
fats that facilitate survival, so the tendency to 
consume meat is functional and healthy, but 
of course damaging if overdone. The World 
Health Organization highlights in their Oct. 
26 report that consumption of 50 grams (0.11 
pounds) of processed meat is linked with an 18 
percent increased risk of colorectal cancer. Yet, 
this increased risk is a relative risk increase, 
meaning that it does not include personal risk 
factors such as pre-existing conditions and 
age in its calculations. The National Cancer 
Institute’s colorectal calculator does not even 
include risks for those under the age of 50.

University Dining mentions the association 

between meat and cancer on their webpage 
explaining Meatless Mondays, a notable con-
cern, but not a sweeping public health concern 
considering that the association is only proven 
for people consuming meat at ages far exceed-
ing the mean age of a Michigan student.

Furthermore, the notion in itself that stu-

dents’ access to meat should be limited over-
steps a previously established boundary. The 
University of Michigan Dining website includes 
pages that provide explanations of accommo-
dations for students with special nutritional 
needs or dietary constraints from religious 
observations. This ideology is compromised 
when East Quad only serves vegetarian options 
on Mondays, not accommodating the majority 
of students who eat meat on a daily basis.

Considering that the association between 

colorectal cancer and processed meat con-
sumption for those under the age of 50 is not 
proven, the public health justifications do not 
seem to outweigh the University’s own aim 
to accommodate all students. After all, dur-
ing various religious holidays with dietary 
restrictions, University Dining strives to 
accommodate religious students but does not 
universally eliminate access to meat and other 
foods to all students. Meatless Mondays at East 
Quad exemplify a doctrine of public health and 
environmental sustainability being pushed 
onto students at the expense of student agency 
in food choice.

A column about ducks

Meatless Mondays
of indoctrination

told me that to her, “worthwhile” 
means it helps you to better under-
stand the world. Mathematicians 
have numbers, scientists have theo-
ries, and writers have words. What-
ever gets us through the day, it seems, 
is worthwhile. By this I mean that we 
(though there are exceptions) feel 
happier when we think we under-
stand what is going on around us, 

even if this understanding does not 
have a direct transition into any tan-
gible “worth.”

“Worthwhile” is a dark pond we 

feel brave just for dipping our toes 
into. That said, how do we decide 
when we are deep enough into the 
water? We must just go with our gut 
feeling, I suppose.

Through all of the doubts, I have 

concluded only this: If we are doing 
something, somewhere along the 
way we must have already decided 
it to be worthwhile.

We might ask ourselves then: 

What is worthwhile about reading 
a column about ducks?

Michigan secondary looks 
to re-establish continuity

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Other than the offensive line, 

perhaps no unit has had more 
continuity for the Michigan 
football team this year than the 
secondary.

After rotating bodies in and 

out constantly in recent years, 
the Wolverines have stuck to 
four players for most of the year.

But on the offensive line, the 

goal is to establish cohesiveness 
and operate as a unit. In the 
secondary, 
each 
player 
is 

different, 
and 
each 
brings 

something different to the table.

There is Jarrod Wilson, a 

senior safety who will make his 
27th career start — second on 
the defense to fifth-year senior 
linebacker 
Desmond 
Morgan 

— Saturday against Rutgers. 
Wilson has earned high praise 
for being the leader of the unit.

As a veteran, he has the task 

of coordinating assignments in 
the back end. Against Michigan 
State on Oct. 17, Wilson warned 
junior defensive backs Channing 
Stribling and Dymonte Thomas 
that the Spartans would look for 
Macgarrett Kings down the left 
sideline on 4th-and-18 late in the 
game. Sure enough, they did, and 
Stribling and Thomas broke it up 
to force the turnover.

Secondary 
coach 
Greg 

Jackson said last week that 
was normal for Wilson, and 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
also expressed appreciation for 
Wilson’s efforts.

“People listen to Jarrod when 

he talks,” Harbaugh said last 
week. “He’s a do-stuff-right 
guy all the time and really 
enjoyable to coach, and talented. 
… It’s something that the public 
doesn’t 
see, 
his 
leadership 

qualities, because he does it in 
such a steady, non-show type of 
way, but I can assure you, he’s 
one of the top leaders on the 
team.”

Then 
there 
is 
junior 

Jourdan Lewis, the lock-down 
cornerback of the group. Lewis 
defends taller receivers well 

considering his 5-foot-10 height. 
On the season, he has 15 pass 
breakups and two interceptions, 
one of which he returned for a 
touchdown.

“The kid’s a competitor,” said 

secondary coach Mike Zordich. 
“I enjoy coaching him, enjoy 
watching him play. We match 
him up against the best receiver 
every week, and he embraces it. 
He really does. 
He’s just fun 
to watch and 
fun to coach.”

Lewis’ 

toughest test 
of 
the 
year 

came against 
Michigan 
State’s Aaron 
Burbridge, 
but he could 
have another 
battle 
this 
weekend 
against 

Rutgers’ Leonte Carroo, who 
is questionable for Saturday’s 
matchup. In just five games this 
season, Carroo has caught 24 
passes for 527 yards and nine 
touchdowns.

The spot opposite Lewis has 

been the only one with much 
fluctuation. 
Stribling 
started 

the year at cornerback, but 

redshirt junior Jeremy Clark, 
who leads the team with three 
interceptions, has started three 
of the past four games. Zordich 
said Wednesday that the two are 
competing for time along with 
other players.

Behind them in the defensive 

backfield, 
redshirt 
freshman 

safety Jabrill Peppers garners the 
most attention in the secondary. 

While most of it 
has been for his 
offensive 
and 

special 
teams 

play lately, he 
spends 
most 

of 
his 
time 

on 
defense, 

starting 
all 

eight 
games 

there so far.

Peppers 

ranks fifth on 

the team with 26 tackles and 
sixth with 4.5 tackles for loss. He 
often makes plays coming off the 
edge in blitz packages.

Unless something changes, 

those four or five — with 
contributions from players such 
as Thomas and junior safety 
Delano Hill — will see the bulk 
of the time in the secondary 
again Saturday. They will try to 

regroup after giving up 26 points 
to the Big Ten’s worst scoring 
offense.

“Last 
week, 
not 
taking 

anything away from Minnesota, 
we just laid an egg defensively,” 
Zordich said. “Especially in the 
secondary, we just played poorly.”

Having two coaches in the 

secondary helps to shore up 
those issues before they escalate. 
Zordich and Jackson’s primary 
emphasis with the defensive 
backs is eye control.

Most of opponents’ big plays 

have come when their receivers 
sneak behind the secondary. 
When the Wolverines watch film, 
they watch the wings on players’ 
helmets, making sure they’re 
focused forward toward the 
receiver and not toward the ball.

Consistency with personnel 

has enabled the Wolverines to 
work tirelessly on that. While 
their unit has been dominant 
for most of the season, each 
individual 
brings 
something 

different to the table.

“As a group, they’re great. 

But just as all of you here are 
different, 
everybody 
in 
our 

room 
is 
different,” 
Zordich 

said. “Everybody has their own 
personalities, which is beautiful.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Senior safety Jarrod Wilson will look to lead Michigan’s secondary back to its dominant ways this weekend.

“As a group, 

they’re great. ... 
Everybody in our 
room is different.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Experience drives 
Ristovski as senior

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Through 
the 
first 
three 

years of her career, Madison 
Ristovski learned from her older 
teammates, but now she fills the 
veteran role.

The guard is one of just two 

scholarship 
seniors 
on 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
roster. 
In 
previous 
seasons, 

Ristovski found herself adapting 
to roles wherever the team 
needed her. From appearing off 
the bench as the Wolverines’ 
sixth player in her sophomore 
season to being an outside 
shooting 
threat 
in 
certain 

situations last year, Ristovski 
has collected an assortment of 
experiences.

Ristovski has been able to 

contribute wherever she has 
played, averaging five points and 
two assists per game through her 
career as well as proving herself 
to be a 3-point threat.

But the senior’s consistency 

has been the strongest asset of 
her game, and Michigan will 
need it now more than ever.

With 
a 
lack 
of 
proven 

upperclassmen, 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico has 
been working hard at grooming 
Ristovski into her new role as the 
Wolverines’ go-to leader.

“I think being a senior and 

having a lot of experience, I’ve 
been able to talk to the younger 
girls about the games I’ve played 
in and the way we practice,” 
Ristovski said. “Having that 
experience, I can help them. 
With my help, the freshmen 
and others can become better 
players.”

Whether 
showing 
the 

freshmen the ropes on the 
court or confidently answering 
questions at Big Ten Media Day 
in Rosemont, Ill., three weeks 
ago, Ristovski is proving herself 
as a vocal force in all areas.

In the weeks preceding the 

Wolverines’ 
opening 
set 
of 

games, Ristovski has stressed 
to her young teammates the 
importance of staying focused.

The 5-foot-10 guard has been 

a part of several talented rosters 
in the past few years but admits 
this year’s squad could have the 
highest ceiling of them all.

With a lot of excitement 

surrounding a top-20 freshman 
class and a rising star, sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty, 

Ristovski has managed to keep 
Michigan’s 
best 
intentions 

within Crisler Center and not let 
the hype get to the team.

“One of the biggest things 

this team is focused on is that 
we’re not going to worry about 
what others are saying about 
us,” Ristovski said. “The only 
people who we care about what 
they think are in this gym right 
now. We have expectations for 
ourselves, 
and 
remembering 

that, we’re not going to get 
rattled by what anyone else says.”

Working with the group of 

nine underclassmen has been 
challenging, but the senior is 
enjoying it. She doesn’t feel as 
much pressure on Michigan 
than in years past, and it’s 
been Ristovski’s job to remind 
the underclassmen not to take 
anything for granted.

“This year, I think because 

we are so young, we bring a 
lot of energy,” Ristovski said. 
“But we need to also bring the 
understanding that we can’t take 
any possessions off. Everyone 
here is talented, but we’ll have to 
see when the games start if we’re 
mature.”

While the guard brings a lot 

of expertise to the table, she 
lacks the experience of playing in 
several consecutive high-minute 
contests. Ristovski has appeared 
in 102 games in her career but 
has landed in the starting five 
just 19 times.

Even 
for 
a 
veteran 
like 

herself, 
educating 
others 

could very well be a unique 
opportunity even for Ristovski. 
Not only can Ristovski help the 
Wolverines reach the high bar 
they’ve set for themselves, but 
she can also begin to instill the 
championship 
mindset 
that 

Barnes Arico desires to establish 
in order to sustain a rising 
Michigan program.

MEN’S SOCCER
Slow start dooms 
‘M’ at Ohio State

By ORION SANG

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team came into Wednesday 
night’s 
matchup 
looking 
to 

avenge last 
year’s 
season-
ending loss to Ohio State.

But the 15th-ranked Buckeyes 

scored 
off 
two 
Wolverine 

miscues in the first half, and 
Michigan was unable to respond, 
falling 3-1. The regular-season 
finale leaves the Wolverines (3-3-
2 Big Ten, 8-5-4 overall) without 
home-field advantage in the 
conference tournament.

“It’s a difficult one,” said 

senior forward James Murphy. 
“Unfortunately, we just didn’t 
catch a few breaks tonight.”

Michigan had a chance to earn 

a share of the regular-season 
conference title, but it was Ohio 
State (5-2-1, 11-5-2) that was 
celebrating its championship-
clinching win at the end of the 
game.

Both teams had chances to 

score early on, with possession 
fairly even between the two 
rivals. However, the Buckeyes 
started to control the ball on the 
Wolverines’ side of the field, and 
their efforts soon paid off.

Ohio 
State 
was 
able 
to 

capitalize off a key Michigan 
mistake to score its first goal. 
Junior defender Andre Morris 
misplayed a ball, and Buckeye 
midfielder 
Kyle 
Culbertson 

pounced on it and launched it 
past sophomore goalkeeper Evan 
Louro.

Less than 10 minutes later, 

another crucial mistake allowed 
Ohio State to extend its lead.

Louro blocked a corner from 

Ohio State’s Liam Doyle, but 
the deflection bounced off the 
backside of Buckeye midfielder 
Zach Mason into the goal.

“There weren’t any defensive 

breakdowns,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Chaka Daley. “There were 
just mistakes. They were very 
fortunate. We made mistakes, 
and they didn’t.”

Following 
Mason’s 
goal, 

Michigan headed into the second 
half down two goals despite its 
good start. The deficit proved to 
be insurmountable.

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

began to up their play in a game 
that became increasingly chippy 
— the second half alone included 
five yellow cards.

“I think there was a little bit 

of frustration,” Murphy said. 
“We were desperate to win the 
game.”

In the 54th minute, Ohio State 

scored to extend its lead when 
Culbertson received a pass from 
forward Yaw Amankwa and 
slipped the ball past Louro once 
again for his second goal of the 
night.

The Wolverines finally got 

on the scoreboard in the 84th 
minute when Murphy scored his 
second goal in two games off an 
assist from freshman defender 
Peter Brown. But it was too little, 
too late.

With the loss, and other 

conference-wide results from 
other games Wednesday factored 
in, the Wolverines will enter this 
weekend’s Big Ten Tournament 
as the No. 6 seed in a road game 
at Maryland.

“We said afterwards that we’ve 

got some more soccer to play,” 
Murphy said, “and we’re going to 
go into this Big Ten Tournament 
and continue to battle.”

‘M’ regroups; Defense coming together

Four of six 

freshmen making 
transition from 
USHL to college

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

With four top defensemen 

returning 
from 
last 
season 

— juniors Michael Downing 
and 
Nolan 

De Jong and 
sophomores 
Zach 
Werenski 
and 
Cutler 

Martin — plus the addition 
of a highly touted freshman 
class, 
there 
was 
no 
doubt 

that Michigan hockey team’s 

defensive corps would be much 
improved in 2015-16.

Downing, though, is convinced 

the unit could be better than just 
good. It could be great.

“We talk about it all the time,” 

Downing said. “This is a good 
year for the defense, probably 
one of the best defensive classes 
since Jon Merrill, Travis Lynch, 
Luke Moffatt and Mac Bennett 
were all here.”

But after giving up 20 goals in 

six games to start the season, the 
defense is off to a slow start.

The blueliners, though, aren’t 

the only ones shouldering blame.

“It’s team defense,” Downing 

said. “It’s not just (the defense). 
There’s certain plays that we need 
to fix. Maybe (a forward) needs 
to come back, or (a goaltender) 

needs to make a save.”

And with a tough trip to 

Boston University looming in 
two weeks, the Wolverines will 
need to shore up their defense 
if they want to 
leave the East 
Coast with two 
wins.

BYE 

WEEK: 
With 12 days 
between 
games, 
Michigan has 
a 
chance 
to 

regroup 
this 

week and work 
on specific areas to help shore up 
its game.

The 
defensemen 
want 
to 

improve puck movement and 

schemes in the defensive zone.

“The coaches told us we need 

to work on some things after 
practice,” Downing said. “For 
me, a lot of the stuff that I want 

to 
work 
on, 

especially with 
(Werenski), is 
in the D-zone. 
We’re going to 
be out there 
against teams’ 
top lines, and 
last game, we 
went 
minus-

3, 
which 
is 

unacceptable 
for both of us.”

As for the forwards, Michigan 

coach Red Berenson wanted 
to see an improvement in the 
faceoff circle. Berenson said 

he wanted to see the centers 
practice 150 faceoffs during the 
bye week.

“It’s kind of a thing to stress 

to all of the centers, to tell 
everyone to collectively work 
on our faceoffs,” said freshman 
forward Cooper Marody. “It’s 
very important to our game, and 
we want to be better.”

USHL VS. MICHIGAN: For 

many players, college hockey 
is a tough transition. Many 
players choose to play in the 
United States Hockey League 
beforehand, and many think 
college 
hockey 
is 
the 
next 

natural stepping stone toward 
the professional leagues.

Of the six freshmen, four 

players — Marody, forward Kyle 
Connor, 
defenseman 
Joseph 

Cecconi and goaltender Chad 
Catt — played in the USHL, and 
there is a clear distinction in 
play.

“Players think at a higher 

level,” Marody said. “But on the 
other hand, guys are bigger and 
faster. It’s the same kind of game 
as you move up in levels. It just 
gets a little big stronger, a little 
bit quicker. So you just have 
to adapt to the speed and the 
strength.”

But that doesn’t mean playing 

college hockey lacks perks.

“When you get the opportunity 

to play (college hockey), it’s 
definitely a lot different flying 
on planes than being on a bus 
to get to places,” Marody said. 
“We have it pretty good here 
compared to the USHL.”

NAILED IT:

the Blind Pig’s Halloween Band Masquerade

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

My whiskers are melting off 

my face from sweat. I am a last 
minute, Rite Aid-eared cat, and 
any bit of feline allure I once had 
has flown out the window by this 
point. As I’m squeezing my way 
past Alex from “A Clockwork 
Orange,” Tom Cruise from “Top 
Gun” and a disarmingly good 
Edward Scissorhands, I can’t 
stifle the thought that I look 
a little basic. This is, after all, 
the Blind Pig’s Halloween Band 
Masquerade — an event built on 
the power of the costume. But all 
great concerts bring salvation. 
This one is the perfect amount 
of dark: the stage, or whoever’s 
being resurrected on it, is the 
solely lit star of the show on this 
chilly Devil’s Night. I can hear 
the next band setting up while I 
stumble downstairs to the 8 Ball 
Saloon to use the little-kitties 
room. Rage Against the Machine 
is coming.

***
The bar looked a lot calmer 

in broad daylight some two days 
earlier, when I sat down — sans 
whiskers — with manager Jef 
Porkins to chat about all things 
spooky and musical. In the 15 
years he has been working at 
the Blind Pig and adjacent 8 Ball 
Saloon, the Halloween Band 
Masquerade has been around for 
eight. The concert’s structure is 
pretty typical: gussied-up people 
saunter in around 9:20 p.m., 
grab a drink and listen to diverse 
sets brought about by some great 
local bands. What’s so spooky 
about that? Well, there’s the 
fact that all the bands are in full 
costume, boasting their best 
impersonations of musical icons 
and replicating those pioneers’ 
most adored songs.

“There was a band called 

Shellac in Chicago,” Porkins 
said, beginning the origin story. 
“They’re fronted by Steve Albini, 
who’s probably the most famous 
of the three of them. And they 
did a set as the Sex Pistols for 
Halloween once. I’ve heard it; 
it sounded terrible, but it was 
really funny. I thought it’d be 
funny to do shows like that, 
and just dress up as a band that 
nobody could see anymore and 
not be able to repeat it.

To put that thought into 

motion, Porkins formed a band 
co-op called Arboco, in which 
roughly 12 local bands started 
to book shows together, pool the 
money earned from those shows 
and set it toward making each 
other’s records. The Halloween 
Band Masquerade is Arboco’s 
most successful (and now only) 
spawn.

“We did more shows, just like 

regular shows throughout the 
year. But this one became such 
a big show, and we were able to 
get so much money from it, that 
we were like, ‘Let’s just do that,’ 
” Porkins said. “We have three 
more records to put out, but we 
only have money for two, so this 
year would be the last year we 
would have to do (the money 
pool). Then after that, if we keep 
doing it then we’d just split the 
money like a normal show.”

Porkins’s band, Scissor Now!, 

is a member of Arboco and one 
of the five performers set to jam 
at the event this year — as Led 
Zeppelin. The bands get to pick 

who they want to be, which is 
always a lengthy, deliberative 
process.

“Every single year, we’re 

loading up (after the show), and 
we’re like, ‘Next year, I want 
to be this.’ We came up with 
Zeppelin really early, I think in 
like February. I was screwing 
around, playing ‘Dazed and 
Confused’ on the bass, and the 
drummer just started playing 
it, and she (lead singer Jessica 
Bratus) 
started 
singing 
it,” 

Porkins said. “And then we 
listened to it, and we learned 

the other parts and we played 
it, and then I was like, ‘Do you 
guys want to be Led Zeppelin?’ I 
had no idea they were gonna say 
yes.”

Since Porkins is a bass player, 

I cheekily asked him how he’s 
going to pull off the non-descript 
charm of Zeppelin bassist John 
Paul Jones. 

“We don’t have a guitar 

player, so I’m splitting the signal 
from my bass and making it 
sound like a guitar, as well. And 
I’m gonna wear a Jimmy John’s 
uniform,” Porkins paused to 
laugh, “because it’s Jimmy Page 
and John Paul Jones.” 

Porkins values the way the 

Halloween Band Masquerade 
has challenged him over the 
years, 
pushing 
his 
musical 

boundaries by forcing his band 
to emulate artists to a T. 

“To listen to all of those, 

and learn all these songs that 
I’ve always wanted to play 
and 
understand 
them 
more 

intimately, I think I’ve grown 
as a bass player — playing like 
Black Flag. I was in a band called 
Suicide by Cop and we did Black 
Flag the second year. And I just 
decided I wasn’t gonna be a 
slouch and I’d actually learn how 
to play like these very technical 
bass lines — for a punk band, at 
least. And it went really well.”

One 
of 
the 
unifying 

characteristics of the concert 
series is that bands are never 
replicated: once Led Zeppelin 
has played the Blind Pig, it 
can’t play again, so long as the 
masquerade 
continues. 
Why 

is this an impenetrable rule? 
Porkins laughed again.

“I think everybody would do 

The Misfits every year,” he said. 
“The other rule was that you 
can’t do a band that somebody 
could just go see right now 
anyway. But that’s kind of fallen 
by the wayside, as well, because 
Motorhead is still around — 
somebody did Motorhead. Daft 
Punk’s still around, and we did 
that. But I mean, if you’re gonna 
present it well and be good at it, 
why not?”

This year’s lineup is completed 

with Counter Crosby as Pink 
Floyd, 
Volcano 
Worshippers 

Hour as Rage Against the 
Machine, Cyrano Jones as The 
Kinks and JUNGLEFOWL as 
Björk. Porkins mused on the 
plight of artists who perform 
covers.

“That’s the one thing about 

this band (Led Zeppelin). The 

other bands, we try to do it 
straight, like they did on the 
record, things like that. For this 
one, we pretty much just have to 
make it our own. That’s what we 
do when we do covers, anyway. 
We change them a lot. Either 
you change them and make them 
your own, or you nail it.”

***
When 
Friday 
night 

approached, I began to realize 
how badly everyone wanted 
to nail it as I waltzed into the 
historic venue, cat ears just shy 
of “on fleek.” I stopped a woman 

wearing skin-tight bellbottoms 
— with a faux protrusion in the 
groin area — in the lobby. It 
turned out to be Jessica Bratus, 
the lead singer of Scissor Now! 
I complimented her on the 
accuracy of her below-the-belt 
Robert Plant simulation, and 
she smiled and pulled out the 
empty water bottle responsible 
for it. A local small business 
owner, 
Bratus 
relishes 
the 

ability to mimic the looks and 
moves of legends on stage every 
year.

“At this show, I have so much 

respect for the levels that the 
bands take it to. People are 
really professional about the 
band that they’re covering, so I 
think that the best part of this is 
watching other people,” Bratus 
said. “Also, for me personally, 
it’s taking on the role of who I’m 
performing as. I watch videos 
— I watch dance videos, like 
lots of performances, so I can 
emulate the moves that they do 
on stage. Robert Plant, he does 
a lot of nifty little moves and a 
lot of wrist-flicking, chest-out, 
hips out, shoulders back.” We 
snickered at the position she 
had wiggled herself into. “It’s 
really funny,” she said.

Then 
Björk 
walked 
past 

me, in swan dress and all. 
Melissa Coppola, second-year 
graduate student in the School 
of Music and lead singer of 
JUNGLEFOWL, was Björk. 

“It’s nice to, like, get in 

character 
— 
you 
know 
— 

pretend I’m from Iceland,” 
Coppola said. She had already 
begun to adopt Björk’s staccato 
mannerisms at that point — and 
it only got better when she took 
the stage.

JUNGLEFOWL opened with 

“Earth Intruders,” which was 
eerily on point. Coppola, or 
Björk, would lower her body to 
the floor in throws of passion, 
shout out Icelandic-accented 
sentiments to the audience. 
Neon lights were rife as she 
sang “Birthday,” a Sugarcubes 
(Björk’s 
first 
band) 
song, 

which was one of the night’s 
highlights.

The Kinks came out next 

with their blue velvet jackets 
and white doily collars. “Lola” 
was the closer and the crowd 
favorite, of course — the whole 
audience was screaming to 
“Now I’m not the world’s most 
passionate guy … ” by the end. 
Cyrano 
Jones/The 
Kinks 

finished, and I realized my 
whiskers were melting off.

***
When I assumed my place 

after the bathroom, among 
vampires 
this 
time, 
Rage 

Against 
the 
Machine 
was 

mulling about the tiny stage. 
The lead singer of Volcano 
Worshippers Hour had put on 
a grandiose Zack de la Rocha 
wig, crisp white shirt and black 
armband. He was traipsing 
around, aggression brewing and 
building, until finally his band 
dropped the opening chords to 
“Bulls on Parade.”

The crowd erupted: moshing 

started in the front, and we 
couldn’t keep our bodies from 
thrashing to the screams of 
who we thought was the actual 
de la Rocha for the majority of 
the set. As far as we (the Tom 
Cruises and the cats alike) 
believed, 
Rage 
Against 
the 

Machine was in Ann Arbor — 
and for one night only.

Finding the best tacos in Ann 

Arbor can be hard. Not because 
there aren’t great tacos around, 
but the place where they’re 
sold is so easy to miss. In an 
especially 
nondescript 
strip 
mall 

on 
an 

especially 
nondescript 
section 
of 

Packard 
road, 
four 

miles 
from 

central 
campus, 
sandwiched 
in 
between 
a 

barbershop 
and 
a 
Middle 

Eastern 
market, 
is 
Tmaz 

Taqueria.

A white cockatoo perches 

outside, preening himself in 
the hopes that a customer will 
toss him a scrap of tortilla or a 
nugget of chicharrón. Judging 
by the serene silence of those 
eating, 
punctuated 
only 
by 

an occasional moan or scrape 
of fork against plate, it’s not 
looking likely.

I have been to Tmaz many 

times, 
for 
their 
defiantly 

spartan tacos — just two corn 
tortillas, 
filled 
with 
meat, 

chopped 
onion, 
a 
sprinkle 

of cilantro, with some lime 
wedges and hot sauce on the 
side. But today, I arrive hungry 
for answers. Most pressing: how 
did this amazing little place end 
up in Ann Arbor, Michigan?

The interior of Tmaz is 

expansive and brightly lit. It 
used to occupy just the narrow 
space next door, which now 
contains the open kitchen and a 
few tables. In May, it expanded 
to include the former grocery 
store next door, where a long 
curving counter and ice cream 
cooler share space with more 
tables and banks of shelves 
containing Mexican sweets and 
dry goods. A faint echo of Latin 
pop drifts out of the kitchen.

Cesar 
Hervert, 
chef 
and 

owner, 
emerges 
from 
the 

kitchen to greet me. We can’t 
shake hands just yet, because 
he was just elbow-deep in a 
mixture of flour and shortening, 
kneading dough for pastries. 
He excuses himself to wash his 
hands, and we then sit together 
at a spare table. Hervert, a short 
man with a three-day stubble 
and an easy smile, recounts 
the long, sometimes arduous 
journey he and his family have 
taken to achieve their present 
success.

Hervert 
was 
born 
in 

Veracruz, Mexico, on the Gulf 
Coast. His father, who owned 
and managed restaurants, made 
his son mop the floors and wash 
dishes after school.

“I hated it,” he chuckles. “At 

that age, I was like ‘I don’t want 
to do this.’ So when I grew up, I 
decided to teach.”

After high school, he found 

work as a middle-school math 
teacher and started a family. By 
age 24, he had a wife, Anna, and 
two sons, Josue and Kevin. But 
economic prospects in Mexico 
were limited.

“Raising two kids, at a young 

age, I decided to find a better 
way to raise them,” he says.

He heard that the increasing 

Latino 
population 
around 

Detroit 
needed 
Spanish-

speaking teachers. He moved 
his family over 1,500 miles 
north, to Ann Arbor, only to 
find that getting certified as a 
teacher required thousands of 
dollars and endless struggles 
with bureaucracy. To make 
ends meet, he did what he knew 
how to do.

“Having a family, raising two 

little kids, getting into college 
… it’s impossible without a lot 
of money and support,” he says. 
“That’s why I decided to stay in 
kitchens.”

For years, Hervert worked 

in restaurants all around Ann 
Arbor, starting as a dishwasher, 
then prep cook, then line cook. 
His former animosity towards 
the restaurant industry evolved 
into a genuine passion. His 
family was settled, his kids were 
in school. But he wanted his 
own restaurant, and he knew a 
niche that could be filled.

“I 
was 
looking 
for 
real 

Mexican food,” he says. “And 
that’s why we opened this 
place.” 

A small space in a small strip 

mall was available. Hervert 
and his wife signed the lease. 
They christened the restaurant 
Tmaz, after Anna’s hometown 
of Temascalcingo, near Mexico 
City. They drew up a simple 
menu. They had no idea what to 
expect.

“We thought, ‘Let’s just open 

something and see if it works,’” 
he said. “In the beginning, it 
was just friends, and we had 
two tables. And it kept growing 
and growing.”

That was four years ago. 

Now, they’re a local institution, 
beloved 
by 
everyone 
from 

fellow Mexicans to University 
students to workers on lunch-
break.

“I have Muslim customers 

who don’t eat pork, Indian 
customers who don’t eat meat, 
Latinos, 
Asians, 
everyone 

comes 
here,” 
Hervert 
said, 

beaming with pride.

In addition to the food tasting 

good, Hervert wants Tmaz to 
be an educational experience. 
In the United States, where 
more salsa is sold than ketchup, 
and where Chipotle is becoming 
more popular than McDonalds, 
many Americans still have no 
idea that what we think of as 
“Mexican” food is really Tex-
Mex.

“People come looking for 

hard shells,” he says. “We don’t 

have hard shells. People come 
looking for nachos or burritos 
— I don’t have anything against 
them, but I grew up in Mexico, 
and I had no idea what a burrito 
was. I saw Speedy Gonzales 
grabbing a burrito, and had no 
idea what he was doing.”

At Tmaz, what you’ll find 

instead 
are 
those 
simple, 

splendid 
tacos, 
bowls 
of 

menudo (tripe soup), tortas and 
hibiscus-flavored agua fresca. 
When an order for guacamole 
enters the kitchen, the cook 
starts by peeling an avocado.

A few non-Mexican items, 

like pupusas and churrasco, 
dot the menu — nods to the 
local Latino community, many 
of whom hail from Guatemala, 
El Salvador and Honduras, and 
for whom Tmaz has become 
more than a restaurant. The ice 
cream and fruit pops are made 
by a Mexican family in Kalam-
azoo who are trying to start 
their own business. An office 
in the former grocery store 
allows many immigrant work-
ers to send their paychecks back 
home. And Hervert is slowly 
filling in the shelves with ingre-
dients that can’t be found in 
most grocery chains: tomatil-
los, cactus paddles, guava and 
over a dozen types of chiles.

In addition to all of this, 

the Hervert family still work 
together at the restaurant. I 
ask Hervert if he wants his 
kids, now 20 and 16, to take 
over the business.

“I don’t see why not,” he says. 

“But of course, as a parent, you 
want something better, you 
know?”

Josue 
is 
an 
unlikely 

candidate — he wants to be 
a lawyer. But Kevin loves 
working in the kitchen, and 
is applying to local culinary 
schools. 
His 
father 
wants 

him to go beyond the family 
restaurant.

“I tell him to go to different 

places — California, New York, 
Miami — and learn different 
cuisines,” he says, radiant. 
“Then, maybe he can go off to 
Europe.”

Before I leave, I tuck into a 

bowl of menudo. The nubbins 
of tripe are tender, the sauce 
is spicy but not too much. 
The menudo has taken a long 
journey to get here, but isn’t 
tired at all.

Buonomo is preening himself 

in the hopes that a customer 

will toss him a scrap of a 

tortilla. To help him out, e-mail

Behind the best tacos

SINGLE REVIEW

 A meaty guitar riff, a 
breathy clearing of the 
throat, a repetition of that 
sultry 
melody, 
and so 
begins 
Grimes’ 
newest 
single. 
Immedi-
ately set-
ting itself apart from much 
of the artist’s previous work, 

“Scream” is an aggressive 
conglomeration of sound. Fea-
turing Taiwanese rapper Aris-
tophanes on main vocals, the 
tone of the track is arresting 
and confusing. In comparison 
to Grimes’ generally angelic, 
falsetto tone of voice, Aris-
tophanes’ playfully taunting 
delivery gives the track a more 
alternative hip-hop feel.
 The only thing that inter-
rupts Aristophanes surging 
flow is the chorus, com-

prised of Grimes’ drawn 
out screams and hissing, 
animalistic panting by Aris-
tophanes. For those listeners 
whose tongue differs from 
that of the Taipei-based 
rapper, the lack of concrete 
lyrics leaves the message 
entirely up to the tone of the 
music. And it is obviously 
one of power, intrigue and 
great things to come from 
Grimes.

-SOMERVILLE

For The Daily

Five family members gather 

around a makeshift dining room 
table, angrily snapping open 
pistachios 
and hurl-
ing scowls 
and swear 
words 
across the 
tabletop. 
Direc-
tor 
Greg 

Strasser, 
a 
School 

of 
Music 

Theatre 
& 
Dance 

senior, 
pauses his 
actors 
to 

ask:

“Have you guys ever watched 

an episode of Spongebob?”

The cast evolves into cartoon 

mode immediately. The scene 
swells and the scowls deepen. 
The pistachios begin to fly 
across the table and dramatic 
calamity ensues.

No, they’re not rehearsing 

a sitcom, or an angry cooking 
show.

The University’s student-run 

theatre group Rude Mechani-
cals is preparing to bring Nina 
Raine’s “Tribes” to the Men-
delssohn Theatre. The con-
temporary play centers on the 
experience of Billy, a deaf man 
who has grown up integrated 
into a chatty British-Jewish 
family. When he meets Sylvia, 
a woman who grew up in a deaf 
family and is slowly going deaf 
herself, he must grapple with 

the complexity of his identity and 
the tribes to which he belongs.

Alongside the quick-witted 

and crude family banter, “Tribes” 
illuminates the harsh realities of 
a group divide between the deaf 
and hearing communities.

“What is my motivation for 

being in this tribe if I’m in it?” 
Strasser asked the cast mem-
bers. “Almost every single time 
it comes down to survivability 
— what increases my chances to 
survive … it comes down to, is my 
tribe going to help me survive?” 

SMTD senior Blair Prince, an 

acting major who plays Sylvia, 
spoke on the diverse nature of 
preparation.

“Every day is a new surprise,” 

Prince said. “What I love about 
this process is that we have dif-
ferent ways to approach each 
scene, each moment … some-
times we do really physical 
exploration, like we might take 
out the text and walk through 
it and expand it, making it as 
big as possible or we might do 
something where we sit down 
and talk about the text and real-
ly get in depth.”

Throughout 
the 
process, 

Prince and the cast members’ 
exercises have ranged from the 
intense to the absurd, but they 
have never stopped being help-
ful.

“There was one time where 

we did a scene as a soap opera. 
It’s a very dramatic moment in 
the show, so to do it as a soap 
opera was just out of this world, 
but it’s just one of those things 
where you’re not watching your-
self anymore, you’re just in it,” 
Prince said.

During rehearsal, the actors 

engage in a physical warm-up, 

where they recite tongue twist-
ers at various speeds to work on 
diction as they move through the 
space. The exercise evolves into 
an impromptu game of tag, where 
the cast is unafraid to jump over 
each other, shriek, laugh or slide 
to the ground.

The cast has also been work-

ing with American Sign Lan-
guage Coach Erica Watson in 
preparation.

“(Learning sign) has been 

really fun. It feels empowering. 
It’s another form of communi-
cation that is so visual,” Prince 
said. “It opens up those facul-
ties — like how do I use my face 
to ask a question or to say that 
I’m angry?”

Of 
her 
character 
Sylvia, 

Prince said “she’s kind of hav-
ing this surreal, very awakening 
experience where she is losing 
part of her identity, so it can be 
scary … she’s experiencing the 
question of what’s next.”

Sylvia is not the only charac-

ter who experiences an awaken-
ing in “Tribes.”

“I wrote in my director’s note 

that I believe that Billy was 
dead until he met Sylvia,” Stras-
ses said, “because she was his 
access to the group of people 
that helped him flourish.”

Amid themes of loss and pain 

that characterize those who live 
in limbo between communities, 
the Rude Mechanicals illumi-
nate the identities of characters 
who have lived lives in the dark 
and, in finding each other, open 
the clear channels of communi-
cation that both human beings 
and quality theater require.

“Tribes” will play at the Lydia 

Mendelssohn Theatre on Friday, 
Nov. 6 at 6:00 p.m.

Sleepless comedy 
from Red Eye 

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“It’s pretty crazy, we don’t know 

much, but there’s a gourd, there’s 
definitely a dildo, Barbara Strei-
sand and there’s a shark,” said LSA 
sophomore Emily Smith.

A producer for this semester’s 

Red Eye Theater, Smith sat down 
for an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily on the morning of Oct. 
31 with co-producer and LSA 
sophomore Molly Leonard, both of 
whom are in the Residential Col-
lege.

“The shark and the dildo go 

together, Barbara Streisand and 
the gourd go together. But I don’t 
know what happens in either of 
(the skits),” Leonard said, elabo-
rating on her co-producer’s state-
ment. 

At the time of the interview, 

both were about halfway through 
the 24-hour gauntlet of theatrical 
creativity that is Red Eye.

Formerly known as Kamikaze, 

Red Eye is run by the RC Play-
ers, a student-run theatre group 
at the University based in the RC 
but open to all students. For Red 
Eye, the group of students writes, 
practices, produces and performs 
two one-act plays, all in a 24-hour 
period. The long-standing tradi-
tion has a well-developed format.

“For the most part, the general 

structure pretty much stays the 
same,” Smith said. “It’s a pretty 
specific schedule that you need to 
stay on track to get two original 
scripts written and locked and 
produced in 24 hours. But I’d say 
this year we included a lot of new 
members, so that was different. 
In the past, it’s been a lot of board 
members who would participate, 
and this year it’s a lot of new faces 
and freshman that we’re really 
excited about.”

Smith and Leonard chose two 

teams of writers, who are com-
prised of eight writers in total. 
They come from a pool of appli-
cants and are chosen based on 
their writing samples and compat-
ibility with the other candidates, 
according to Leonard. 

Smith and Leonard continuous-

ly lead into each other, elaborating 
on eachother’s responses as they 
describe the creative processes 
that take place over the course of 
Red Eye, emphasizing the collab-
orative aspects.

“So we do ‘Minute of Me,’ where 

each actor goes on stage and talks 
about things that they have never 
done on stage before that they 
would like to do, or characters 
they would like to portray. Then 
the writers take notes on that, 
and after that they break off into 
rooms. Then the writers just start 
making an outline and start writ-
ing,” Smith said.

As the writers develop their 

plays, the actors take part in games 
and exercises to prepare for the 
fast-approaching performances.

“We usually do a lot of improv, 

and then this year we also did a 
lot of character building exercises 

with different scenarios, differ-
ent movements and working with 
a specific movement and what 
emotion that evokes,” Smith said, 
describing the actors’ activities for 
the night.

“It’s not uncommon for writ-

ers to run into the auditorium, the 
Keene Theater, at like two in the 
morning, go up to an actor and be 
like ‘Are you cool with this? What 
do you think of this?’ and then run 
back out,” Leonard said.

While participants aren’t forced 

to remain awake for the whole 
period, both Smith and Leonard 
acknowledged the strange allure 
of Red Eye, which kept them up 
well into the earliest hours of the 
morning and would continue to 
drive them through the rest of the 
day.

“You’re just so excited and so 

exhausted at the same time and it’s 
such a weird mix,” Leonard said.

This unique energy manifest-

ed itself throughout the night as 
indicated by the stories Smith and 
Leonard recalled.

“So all the actors bring in a prop 

to use during the show and one girl 
says, ‘I brought a unicorn horn’ 
and pulled out a strap-on and just 
put it on her head,” Smith said.

“This was a violently purple 

strap-on,” Leonard said, adding to 
the image.

“I was honestly expecting a uni-

corn horn,” Smith said. 

“I was a little disappointed that 

it wasn’t a unicorn horn, after the 
initial shock of like, ‘Oh, that’s a 
penis.’” Leonard said in agree-
ment.

“That probably defined the 

night,” said Smith, finishing the 
story.

That night the performances 

began at 8 p.m. Amid a small the-
atre packed with a festively cos-
tumed and eager-to-participate 
crowd, Smith and Leonard intro-
duced the product of their 24-hour 
endeavor.

Beginning with a play that fol-

lows the behind-the-scenes esca-
pades of a celebrity charity ice 
skating competition, “The Rinkon-
venient Truth,” the distinctive 
enthusiasm that Smith and Leon-

ard discussed earlier in the day 
becomes apparent.

Flubbed lines are entertaining 

additions instead of frustrating 
mistakes as the audience watches 
senator and presidential candi-
date Duncan Deez Nuts square off 
against the ego of Barbara Strei-
sand and the universally beloved 
Al Gourd, pun completely intend-
ed.

The 
madcap 
plotting 
and 

absurd humor is something that 
can only be dreamed up dur-
ing the long, sleepless hours that 
Red Eye enforces on its writers 
and casts. But enthusiasm never 
wanes as actors emphatically 
react to the unspoken speech of a 
gourd.

This continues with “I Know 

What You Did Last Shark Week,” 
where a group of actors bringing 
“Jaws” to the stage find them-
selves beset by the vengeful spirit 
of a murdered cast member. Play-
ing out like a Red Eye from hell, 
egotistical actors clash with an 
obsessive director as forces from 
beyond the grave pick them off 
one-by-one. The only calming 
force is that of “the third best 
medium in Long Island,” Donna-
tella D’Guido, who uses a strap-on 
to communicate with the dead.

Consistently crazy and surpris-

ingly clever at points, the plays are 
bolstered by their casts’ energy 
and commitment to the inherent 
ridiculousness of their roles. It’s 
a collaborative performance that 
can’t be seen every day, as Smith 
and Leonard indicated in the 
interview.

“There’s nothing else like it, 

honestly,” Leonard said. “People 
are like, ‘Yeah, it’s like pulling an 
all-nighter,’ and it is but A) you’re 
not doing your homework and B) 
you’re pulling an all-nighter, but 
with 25 other people.”

Looking back on the event that 

had kept her up for more than 
24-hours, Smith had this to say 
about her time as a co-producer: 

“It’s really kind of just surreal 

and absurd, but just so much fun. 
I mean, you really can’t describe 
it. It’s just such a unique experi-
ence.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Days before the release of 
the infamous “Hotline Bling” 
video, an underappreciated 
L.A.-based 
producer 
and 
rapper 

named Bus-
driver 
sent 

out a tweet 
saying 
that 

“hip hop is 
the 
driv-

ing business 
innovator 
in 
popular 

culture.” 
Less 
than 

two weeks removed from his 
speculation, I’m afraid Drake 
and Travis Scott have proved 
him right. We all saw Drake’s 
out-of-place 
self-promotion 

last week, but what makes it 
any different from Kanye and 
Travis stumbling around the 
woods draped in Yeezy Season 
1 (the day after the release, no 
less)?
 Well, a lot of things. It’s no 
secret that rap is becoming 
increasingly 
corporate, 
but 

there’s a difference between 
advertising and using multiple 
avenues for artistic expression. 
While “Hotline Bling” was 
effectively a “now in-stores” 

service 
announcement 
for 

OVO clothing, the beige suede 
that covers ‘Ye and Scott here 
serves as an extension of that 
Orwellian/post-apocalyptic 
world they communicate with 
their music. It even takes place 
in the woods; they’re running 
from something. The “separate 
but equal” doctrine need not 
apply to fashion, music and 
video when they can work 
in tandem as channels for 
expression.
 For example, Yasiin Bey’s 
appearance 
is 
completely 

unwarranted, but his masked 
prancing adds to the hellish 

nature of a video titled “Piss 
On 
Your 
Grave.” 
Kanye 

literally raps his soul out. 
Though Travis spends most of 
the video hiding behind ‘Ye, at 
least his generally pissed-off 
demeanor doesn’t contradict 
the song. Instead of inciting 
me to open a new tab and cop 
some basic-ass sweater, they 
held my attention and gave 
me a glimpse into a world I 
had previously only visited 
through music. The video isn’t 
so much a “visual aid” as it is 
piece strong enough to stand 
on its own.

TRAILER REVIEW

 This time, it’s personal. At 
least it seems that way, based 
on the trailer for “Spectre,” in 
which Dan-
iel Craig 
portrays 
the iconic 
super-spy, 
James 
Bond, for 
what might 
be the last 
time. The 
“Spectre” 
trailer 
gives brief glimpses into the 
intrigue Bond will pursue in 
Mexico City — a man masked in 
the style of a Día de los Muertos 
skeleton, a sniper on a roof, a 
potential local love interest. 
Most enticing, we get glimpses 
and snippets of Christoph 
Waltz (“Inglourious Basterds”) 
as Oberhauser, who claims to 
be “the author of all (Bond’s) 

pain.”
 The trailer gives previews 
of the plot without giving too 
much away, hints at the vil-
lain’s motives without revealing 
them, and even gives us some 
classic Bond humor, when he 
japes that he visited Mexico 

City for a “long overdue holi-
day.” Expectations are high for 
“Spectre,” especially given the 
critical success of “Skyfall.” But 
if the film is as good as the trail-
er, there should be no problem 
living up to those expectations.

EPISODE REVIEW

 Throughout its past season, 
“Black-ish” has established 
itself as a show that isn’t afraid 
to address 
some of the 
more dif-
ficult ques-
tions about 
race. While 
its Hallow-
een episode 
isn’t as sharp 
or pointed 
in its social 
commentary 
as the season 
premiere (which tackled the use 
of the n-word), it does use the 
holiday to discuss heavier family 
relationships.
The episode’s two primary 
sources of conflict arise when 
Dre’s (Anthony Anderson, “Guys 
with Kids”) cousin June Bug 
(Michael Strahan, “Brothers”), 
who used to beat him up as a 
kid, visits at the same time as 
the kids’ cousins, who steal their 
candy on a yearly basis.
 It’s in the discussion of the 
relationship between the cous-
ins and their Johnson counter-

parts where this episode falters. 
While the questions it brings up 
involving the class differences 
between Dre’s family (who 
“got out of the hood”) and their 
poorer cousins are worthwhile 
— and it should get credit for 
discussing them — the show’s 
answers felt rushed and under-
developed. June Bug’s reasoning 
behind his actions (protecting 
Dre’s future) only comes out in 
a discussion between Dre and 
his mother. What could actu-
ally be a powerful moment gets 
lost in a 30-second scene where 
the only meaningful aspect is 
a smile from Strahan. Maybe 
the writers were worried about 
Strahan’s acting ability, but they 
should have done more to help 

build the sequence’s signifi-
cance.
 On a positive note, the com-
edy does get mileage from Hal-
loween. Having the Johnson 
family dress up as the Obamas 
(complete with a Secret Service 
agent and the dog Bo) led to 
hilarious moments involving 
Junior (newcomer Marcus 
Scribner) “protecting” Dre, and 
Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross, “Girl-
friends”) questioning which 
Michelle Obama outfit to wear. 
(Plus, it let Anderson break out 
his Obama impersonation.) 
Ultimately, this is what ground-
ed an episode that tried to make 
a larger point, but didn’t quite 
give it the necessary time.

CONCERT REVIEW
It’s not too late
for Norah Jones

Jones disappoints 

at Michigan 
Theater show

By ADAM DEPOLLO

Managing Arts Editor

I wrote my last full-blown con-

cert review almost exactly one 
year before the one that you’re 
currently reading, shortly after 
I saw L.A. producer/musical 
savant Flying Lotus play in front 
of a full house at the Royal Oak 
Music Theater. 

That show came about a 

month after he dropped his atom 
bomb of a jazz/hip-hop/electron-
ica-fusion album You’re Dead! to 
near universal critical acclaim, 
and his performance that night 
was — and continues to be — the 
only live musical event that has 
compelled me to start openly 
weeping (while sober, no less) 
from pure audiovisual stupefac-
tion. In fact, my aesthetic sensi-
bilities were so hyper-stimulated 
that I felt the need to put things 
in my review like “Flying Lotus is 
one of those artists … who seems 
to have reached as nearly as one 
can, however fleetingly, to per-
fection,” or that “I experienced 
something uncanny, something 
that I’m not sure I have the liter-
ary wherewithal to articulate.” 

The fact that I finished the 

review shows, I think, that I had 
a bit more writerly panache than 
I was willing to own up to (so 
much so that I actually used the 
phrase “literary wherewithal” 
non-ironically), but I definitely 
wasn’t just stringing together a 
series of artistically-embellished 
critical 
exaggerations, 
either. 

Yes, I committed the mortal sin 
of referring to a piece of art as 
“perfect,” but, toward the end 
of the review, I made a very 
important qualification of that 
term which, I think, excuses the 
transgression: “perfection is a 
very different thing from being 
flawless.” Flying Lotus was per-
fect, in other words, because he 
possessed that irrational, quasi-
magical ability “to reconfigure 
flaws and mistakes into a work-
able whole, shoring up the gaps 
with his own innovations,” to 
effortlessly weave what would be 
errors in any other context into 
a new musical logic of his own 
invention

Now, the reason I’m bringing 

up Flying Lotus and my review 
from last year is that, believe 
it or not, I learned that defini-
tion of “perfect” from listening 
to Norah Jones. Yes, that Norah 
Jones — the one whose name you 
can’t hear without having a venti 
Pumpkin Spice Latte™ violently 
erupt through the walls of your 
subconscious. 

Back in 2002 — before a 

decade of aggressive Starbuck-
sification made it impossible to 
publicly enjoy anything warm, 
mid-tempo or acoustic without 

being considered an agent of 
the counter-revolution — Norah 
Jones was occupying a niche 
which bore certain striking simi-
larities to the one Flying Lotus 
is inhabiting right now in 2015. 
Her debut album Come Away 
With Me was a firm and entirely 
unexpected wake-up nudge for 
the genres it straddled, picked 
apart and stitched back together 
into an expertly knitted, toasty 
quilt of American popular music. 
It reminded jazz that people 
under the age of 60 would still 
pay money to hear a dimin-
ished chord if you dusted it off 
and bought it a new coat, and it 
reminded pop, folk and bluegrass 
that you could jam more than 
one feeling into a song when you 
actually used all twelve of the 
notes in the octave. Admittedly, 
the subdued piano, jazz brushes 
and husky singing that serve as 
Jones’s calling cards don’t com-
pel you to get off your ass in the 
same way Flying Lotus’s synthe-
sizers and chunky-smooth drum 
samples do, but you can’t help 
but walk away from You’re Dead! 
or Come Away With Me with the 
feeling that all is not lost in the 
world. They’re musical remind-
ers that dead ends are man-made, 
and whether you tear down a 
wall or build yourself a staircase, 
with enough vision and technical 
skill you can always find a way to 
keep going forward. They might 
not be flawless, but they’re new, 
and that’s as close as music can 
get to perfect.

The 
problem 
with 
Norah 

Jones, though, is that somewhere 
in the post-Come Away With Me 
hype, she got lost in the maze. It’s 
hard to say why that is — maybe 
it was her old-fashioned humil-
ity and common decency (after 
sweeping the Grammies in 2003, 
she told Katie Couric “I felt like 
I went to somebody else’s birth-
day party and I ate all their cake. 
Without anybody else getting a 
piece”), maybe it was the Star-
bucksification (when your Blue 
Note record sells 26 million cop-
ies in the 21st century, it’s pretty 
hard to justify switching things 
up), or maybe the creative juju 
wasn’t really there in the first 

place (Jones only had two-and-a-
half writing credits on that first 
album, after all, and her later 
discography is almost all original 
tunes) — but with the exception 
of a couple of brief bright spots 
like “Chasing Pirates” from The 
Fall, Jones has been banging her 
head against the same jazz-pop-
fill-in-the-blank-fusion wall that 
she and her cowriters built back 
in 2002. 

Now, depending on how we 

want to think about Norah 
Jones, that might not necessar-
ily be a problem. If she’s just a 
chanteuse to you, just an incred-
ibly 
talented 
lounge 
singer 

whose skills far exceed the con-
fines of the genre she’s work-
ing in, then she can rest on her 
laurels and spend the rest of her 
days giving performances like 
the one she did at The Michigan 
Theater on Monday night. That 
is, of course, if you prefer your 
music to be of the anesthetic art 
object variety, and your idea of a 
good night involves going slack-
jawed in front of a beautiful 
voice with no emotion behind 
it. But the fact that an audience 
member shushed me for hum-
ming along to a Puss N Boots 
song that included the lyrics 
“Hey, you, don’t tell me what to 
do” suggests where that idea of 
fun is headed. (It’s fascism). 

I won’t talk too much more 

about Norah Jones’s perfor-
mance on Monday because, 
again, you can’t argue with 
the anesthetic art object. It’s 
a dead-end that doesn’t even 
want to be a way out, and I’d 
rather spend my time looking 
for the artists who are swinging 
sledgehammers around. 

The thing is, though, that 

Norah Jones could be one of 
those artists. She was back in 
2002 — that’s why she won all 
those Grammies and sold 26 
million records. That’s why 
people love her, and that’s why 
seeing her fade into the back-
ground behind her own band 
is a damn shame. You can do 
perfect Norah Jones, and I just 
hope that on your next album 
and your next tour, you can 
start doing it again.

FILM REVIEW
‘Our Brand’ is a 
flaming car wreck

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

For The Daily

“No one watches a car race to 

see who wins, only who crashes 
and goes up in flames.” Sandra 
Bullock’s 
(“Grav-
ity”) char-
acter, Jane 
Bodine, 
fittingly 
known as 
“Calami-
ty,” relates 
this quote 
to politics, 
and how most people just enjoy 
seeing who crashes and burns, 
not who wins. Ironically, this 
quote also describes most of 
“Our Brand Is Crisis:” a series 
of crashes and burns. 

Hopelessly struggling in the 

Bolivian polls, Pedro Castillo 
(Joaquim de Almeida, “Fast 
Five”) 
— 
the 
fictionalized 

version of 2002 presidential 
candidate Sánchez de Lozada 
— hires an American campaign 
management 
team. 
Bodine 

leads 
the 
team 
as 
their 

strategist. 
She 
reluctantly 

decides to join the team when 
she learns that her old political 
rival, Pat Candy (Billy Bob 
Thornton, 
“Entourage”), 
is 

working 
for 
the 
opposing 

candidate, Victor Rivera (Louis 
Arcella, “The Family”). The 
politics quickly turn dirty, 
and Bodine doesn’t hesitate 
to carry out illegal action to 
ensure Castillo wins.

The first noticeable sign of 

the film’s poor quality is its 
horrendous 
cinematography, 

which is best indicated by the 
cringe 
-inducing use of slow 

motion. Instead of enhancing 
scenes 
by 
increasing 
the 

emotion or tension, it’s used 
during bland moments, like 
when Bodine is simply walking 
out of her office — suddenly 
her walking is slowed, but 
she resumes her normal pace 
the second she steps outside. 
This would have made more 

sense thematically had it been 
preceded by an inspirational 
speech 
or 
dramatic 

breakthrough with Castillo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Along with the excessive 

visual effects, the movie is 
cluttered 
with 
scenes 
that 

add zero relevant substance. 
For some absurd reason, the 
director felt it necessary to 
yet again highlight Bodine’s 
irrational 
decision 
making. 

Watching Bullock moon Rivera 
and his team after overtaking 
them in a race through the 
jungle 
could 
have 
possibly 

been comical, but it completely 
misses the mark as far as 
humorous moments go.

The one positive aspect, 

though 
far 
from 
a 
saving 

grace, is the character dynam-
ic between Bodine and Ben 
(Anthony Mackie, “The Aveng-
ers: Age of Ultron”). This adds 
a sense of realism to the other-
wise far-fetched movie. They 
push each other to be the best 
and eventually come to under-
stand each other on a deeper 
level than typical coworkers. 
When Bodine jumps out of the 
car during the last riot, which 
indicates her choosing to stay 
and combat corruption running 
rampant throughout Bolivia, 

Ben understands her choice 
without having to exchange 
any words — he simply nods 
and says, “OK.” 

The other members of Cas-

tillo’s hired campaign crew 
only add to the clutter. While 
private investigator LeBlanc 
(Zoe Kazan, “The Walker”) 
and former State Department 
member Nell (Ann Dowd, “The 
Leftovers”) fall to the back-
ground, TV ad director Buck-
ley (Scott McNairy, “Halt and 
Catch Fire”) sorely sticks out as 
the obnoxious, condescending 
asshole. After the first few sur-
prisingly comical comments, 
the viewer might reasonably 
want to punch him in the face. 
Buckley spends so much time 
criticizing others that he is 
utterly useless in forwarding 
Castillo’s campaign.

The puerile image of Bullock 

falling down the stairs in 
this 
ill-conceived 
dramedy 

perfectly displays how this 
film is a major downfall in 
her acting career. So, if you’re 
looking 
for 
entertainment 

this weekend, you might have 
a better time reading about 
the 2002 Bolivian election on 
Wikipedia than watching “Our 
Brand Is Crisis.”

MY FIRST FAVORITE ALBUM
The West Coast 
sorcery of Dr. Dre

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

This week, Daily Music Writ-

ers are looking back on the first 
albums they ever loved. Today, 
Shayan Shafii remembers Dr. 
Dre’s Chronic 2001.

When I was in the ninth 

grade, my parents took me and 
my sister on a trip to Los Ange-
les (affectionately referred to as 
“Tehrangeles” within the Per-
sian community) to kick it with 
some distant family-friends. I 
neither knew who they were nor 
cared, as I was only interested in 
getting the hell out of West Vir-
ginia. My hometown, Charleston, 
is a small working class “city” of 
about 50,000. One of those plac-
es where the best place to eat is 
a greasy breakfast joint called 
“Tudor’s Biscuit World.” I was 
13 years old at the time, and my 
computer was basically the only 
portal I had into the developed 
world.

Right at the cusp of those 

rebellious teenage years, the trip 
proved to be pivotal in putting 
me on to urban youth culture. No 
memory captures this more than 
when a family friend took me on 
a car ride with his CD of choice: 
Dr. Dre’s seminal Chronic 2001. 
I’ll be honest, I understood little 
to nothing of what Kurupt and 
Hittman were rapping about on 
“Xxplosive,” but my friend didn’t 
stop laughing for three minutes. 
Whatever this sorcery of “West 
Coast rap” was, I couldn’t wait to 
bring its fuckery back to the tran-
quil suburbs of West Virginia.

Upon my return, I developed 

an interest in digging up the 
grimiest, filthiest music that 
South Central L.A. had to offer. 
Chronic 2001 was first on my list, 
and what followed were several 
years of rap-inspired shenani-
gans from hilariously out-of-
place white kids in a largely Black 
high school. I couldn’t quite 
pinpoint why the music was so 
appealing to me, but I continued 
to listen despite missing every 
reference and innuendo.

I remember speculating that 

Xzibit’s line on “What’s The Dif-
ference,” “My style is like a reac-
tion from too much acid,” might 
have actually been a chemistry 
joke. Almost every other lyric 
was a reference to NWA, whom I 
had only recognized from shirts 
worn by local mall rats. I never 
cuffed my khakis until Dr. Dre 
gave me the idea on the hook of 
“Still D.R.E.” Point being, this 
album turned me into the classic 
suburban rap fan but set me up to 

learn more about the culture if I 
was willing to put in the time.

Sentimental value aside, 2001 

was an ideal starting point, 
boasting features from legends 
like Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Nate 
Dogg and Six-Two. I went on to 
consume entire discographies at 
a time, starting from the featured 
artists and eventually spread-
ing out to whatever popped up 
in YouTube comments sections. 
Ensuing weekends were wasted 
away playing FIFA in my friend’s 
basement while running through 
old Snopp Dogg records.

Where the suburbs deprived 

us of any real culture, the Inter-
net and West Coast rap gave 
us something to look into, to 
almost stand behind. Obviously 
none of us were from Crenshaw, 
but feeling the need to clear up 
the misconceptions surround-
ing the culture was more than 
enough reason to keep listen-
ing.

AFTERMATH

He has a symmetrical face. And a sharp haircut. Have a great day, Dr. Dre!
