hospital where he received a life=

aplastic anemia, a disease that

LEGAL DISPUTE
Jenson faces
federal child
porn charges

Almost100 images,
4 videos found in
former UMHS
resident's home
By ADAM RUBENFIRE.
Daily News Editor
Former University of Michi-
gan Health System resident
Stephen Jenson is now facing
federal charges of possessing
and receiving child pornography
via the internet, according to an
affidavit filed yesterday with the
United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan.
The U.S. Secret Service filed
the affidavit, alleging that Jen-
son possessed 97 images and four
videos of "suspected child por-
nography" on electronic devices
seized in a Dec. 2, 2011 search
warrant executed by detectives
from the University's Depart-
ment of Public Safety.
Last May, a medical resi-
dent found a USB thumb drive
plugged into a computer in a

resident's lounge at the Univer-
sity Hospital that contained sus-
pected child pornography and
determined that it was Jenson's.
She later reported her findings
to her supervisor who then noti-
fied the Health System Legal
Office, though DPS was not prop-
erly notified until late November,
according to an internal report
released bythe University on Fri-
day.
Rather than graphical repre-
sentations of child pornography,
the affidavit notes that agents
observed depictions of "real chil-
dren engaged in sexually explicit
conduct."
Jeff Frost, special agent ,in
charge of the U.S. Secret Ser-
vice's Detroit field office, con-
firmed in an interview yesterday
that his office filed the federal
charges.

types of investigations with our

Lecture

LectureTools

to make class more
interactive
By ZENA DAVE
For the Daily
Since the University launched
of a new version of LectureTools
last fall, professors and students
have found both benefits and
drawbacks from utilizing the
program in the classroom.
LectureTools was created by
Perry Samson, a professor in
the Department of Atmospheric,
Oceanic and Space Sciences, and
is a web-based program that
allows students to access lec-
ture materials on their laptops,
mobile phones and tablets. Pro-
fessors can also form interac-
tive lectures in which students
can ask and answer questions in
real time, and responses can be
displayed once students have fin-
ished an activity.
LectureTools has been rapidly
replacing the use of iClickers in
large University lecture halls as
a more efficient method of track-
ing student participation and
engagement.

Literary living

What were your dreams as a kid?
To be a writer. I wanted to write the
great American novel. When I was a
young teenager, I also thought it would
be really cool to die young, a la Sylvia
Plath or Jack Kerouac, so that everyone
would lament how I hadn't reached
my potential. Now that I'm older, it
seems a lot braver to just keep working
toward your potential no matter what.
I still haven't written my novel, but
now someone like Frank McCourt, who
wrote "Angela's Ashes" when he was 65
years old, is more of a role model.
What is your most awkward and
most pleasant teaching experience?
My most awkward teaching experi-
ence was last year, when I was trying
to teach 80 students in'hands-on
activities' in a residence hall basement
at night. This year, the second time

around, has been much more pleasant,
both because I'm more organized and
because we've got smaller sections. I
remember particularly enjoying teach-
ing a section of English 124 that was
on literature of the body - we wrote
about "Alice in Wonderland," Dalton
Trumbo's "Johnny Got His Gun,"
Freud's "Dora" and Susanna Kaysen's
"Girl, Interrupted." That class just had
a lot of fun.
Tell us a random fact about
yourself.
I have sung with the (University Musi-
cal Society) Choral Union since 1996.
We won several Grammys in 2004 for
our recording of William Bolcom's
"Songs of Innocence and of Experi-
ence," including Best Classical Album,
Best Choral Recording, Prof. Bolcom,
who received the Grammy for Best

Classical Contemporary Composition
in 2006, is on the Music faculty at the
University of Michigan.
What do you do outside of work?
I sing. I used to do a lot of community
theater when I had more time. I'm on
the Board of Directors with Ann Arbor
Civic Theater. I play with Legos with
my 10-year-old stepson and do puzzles
a fair amount in my spare time. I like to
go for long family bike rides and hikes.
What is one life message you want
your students to take away from
your classes?
Invest whatever you do with your own
meaning - you are here to grow and
learn for yourself, notto work toward a
grade or someone else's opinion of you.
In order to grow, it's necessary to take
risks and even to fail.

Libyan judicial system unequipped to
handle cases of Gadhafi supporters

Judicial disarray sign
of dysfunction among
militias
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) - One
of the first trials for thousands
of Libyans detained on suspicion
of links to the ousted regime
of Moammar Gadhafi is turn-
ing into a prime example of how
unequipped the country's justice
system is to handle the cases.
At a hearing in the eastern city
of Benghazi yesterday, a Gadhafi-
era judge in a Gadhafi-era military
courtroom planned to hear evi-
dence against 50 people accused of
the Gadhafi-era crime of "treason
against the revolution."
But the judge postponed the
hearing because the militia that
has detained the defendants
refused to bring them to court.

The case underlines how much
power still lies with the hundreds
of militias that fought Gadhafi's
troops during the eight-month
civil war, which ended when the
longtime dictator was captured
and killed last October.
It also indicates how, one year
after the start of the anti-Gadhafi
uprising, the National Transi-
tional Council now ruling Libya
has made little progress in fill-
ing the void left by the collapse of
Gadhafi's regime with effective
state institutions like courts and
organized security forces.
The NTC has so far failed to
extend its control over the hun-
dreds of militias that fought in
the war. Nor has it taken control
over the scores of detention cen-
ters these groups run for people
accused of links to the Gadhafi
regime. Human rights groups say
these centers hold thousands of

people, some of whom have been
tortured.
The NTC's head, Mustafa
Abdul-Jalil, acknowledged the
body's shortcomings in an inter-
view with Al-Jazeera television
yesterday.
"After the liberation, the
national council's deficits sur-
faced," he said. He said the
72-member body was "very slow"
in making decisions, largely
because "everybody is afraid that
if they speed up, financial corrup-
tion will take place."
While highly respected among
Libyans, Abdul-Jalil has faced
mounting criticism since the
war's end for being unable to
impose the council's authority.
But he also blamed the fighters
themselves for refusing to return
to civilian life or integrate into
the new government's security
forces.

Tactic aims to
challenge Santorum
in Michigan primary
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP)
- Republican presidential can-
didate Mitt Romney is wooing
tea partyers in his home state of
Michigan with a potentially risky
strategy: blasting the auto indus-
try bailout that many people
credit with savingthe state's most
vital industry..
The tactic seems designed to
undermine Rick Santorum's pop-
ularity with conservatives who
dislike government intervention
in business, even when the results
appear defensible. It also reinforc-
es Romney's image as an experi-
enced capitalist who understands
the pain sometimes involved in
makingcompanies work.
Santorum's fast rise in nation-
al polls has forced Romney to
sharpen his criticisms of the for-
mer Pennsylvania senator. Santo-
rum says his team will "plant our
flag" in Michigan while also cam-
paigning in other states.
A Romney loss in Michigan's
Feb. 28 primary would be hugely
embarrassing, or worse, to his
campaign. His team has pro-
moted an aura of inevitability for
months, but Romney has failed to

persuade the party's most conser-
vative segments to embrace him.
Romney's father was a top auto
executive and three-term gov-
ernor of Michigan, and Romney
still holds big financial advantag-
es over Santorum, Newt Gingrich
and Ron Paul. Thus far, he has
bought far more TV advertising
time than they have.
When longtime Michigan
political analyst Craig Ruff was
asked if a Romney loss here
is conceivable, he said: "I'm
astounded, but yes." Ruff worked
for Republican Gov. William
Milliken but now is an indepen-
dent.
He said he was surprised by
how vigorously Romney is criti-
cizing the government rescue of
General Motors and Chrysler in
2008-2009.
"Many, many Republicans
have ties to the auto industry,"
through investments or current
or former employment, Ruff
said. "He's got a lot of explaining
to do."
Some GOP activists, however,
said Romney's actions make
sense. He already was on record
opposing the bailouts. So his
Tuesday op-ed in the Detroit
News gave him a chance to elab-
orate, they said. And his stance
will appeal to business-oriented
Republicans as well as more


libertarian-leaning voters who
oppose government intrusion in
general.
"It may be dicey in the general
election, but it's not dicey in the
primary," said Lansing-based
Republican strategist Steve
Mitchell. "Republicans opposed
the auto bailout. They opposed
other bailouts. They oppose bail-
outs."
A May 2010 poll conducted by .
EPIC-MRA for the Detroit Free
Press found that nearly two-
thirds of Michigan adults thought
the auto bailout was a good idea.
Republicans were more closely
divided, with 51 percent calling it
a good idea, and 43 percent call-
ing it a bad idea.
Santorum, Gingrich and Paul
also criticized the auto industry
rescue, but Romney's remarks
have drawn more attention
because of his ties to the state
and the auto industry.
Santorum hopes Michigan's
tea party supporters will vote
in big numbers, possibly over-
whelming Romney's advantage
with party insiders. Insurgent
candidates have done well here
it times. Pat Robertson won
the GOP primary in 1988. John
McCain beat George W. Bush
here in 2000 after then-Gov.
John Engler promised Michigan
would be Bush's firewall.

Feds add charge to
Kilpatrick case
Federal prosecutors have
added a charge to the corrup-
tion case against former Detroit
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.
The indictment returned
Thursday accuses Kilpatrick
and his pal Bobby Ferguson of
extorting money from a city con-
tractor who towed vehicles. The
government says the two men
shared $50,000 in June 2008,
just four months before Kilpat-
rick pleaded guilty in a crimi-

office. The allegations include
other instances of money chang-

Messages seeking comment

NEW CASTLE, Pa.
Smokehouse fire,
'best-smelling in a
long time,' put out
Firefighters in Pennsylva-
nia have managed to save 200
pounds of Polish sausage from
what they're calling the best-
smelling fire they've doused in
years.
The New Castle News reports
that firefighters responded about
11:30 a.m. Monday when a 20-by-
20-foot smokehouse caught fire
in the yard of Cash Koszela (koh-
ZEL'-uh). He's a retired meat cut-
ter who's been smoking his own
sausage for about 30 years.
Firefighters say some grease
caught fire when the smokehouse
got too hot - about 300 degrees.
Koszela says it will cost about
$3,000 to replace the smoke-
house. It's actually a tin-lined
walk-in cooler fed by smoke piped
in from a fire pit.
Assistant Fire Chief David
Joseph says, "This is definitely
the best-smelling fire we've seen
in a long time."

Defense begins in
Virginia lacrosse
murder trial
A defense witness in the mur-
der trial of a former University of
Virginia lacrosse player says the
defendant's ex-girlfriend suffo-
cated while she lay face down in
a pillow in her bedroom.
Dr. Jan E. Leestma testified
Wednesday in the trial of George
Huguely V. The 24-year-old is
accused in the May 3, 2010, death
of Yeardley Love. Prosecutors say
she died as a result of a battering
at the hands of Huguely.
In his testimony, Leestma
said it was his medical opinion
that Love was asphyxiated when
blood and fluids from her mouth
sealed off her breathing.

The defense began its presen-
* tation yesterday after prosecutor
Dave Chapman rested. He called
about 50 witnesses, including
medical experts who said Love
died a result of blunt force trau-
ma that bruised and wrenched
her brain.
TOKYO
SJapan planned
review of tsunami
risk, but too late
Four days before a tsunami
devastated a Japanese nuclear
plant, its operator promised a
fuller assessment of the risk of
such a disaster - but not for
seven months.
The disclosure in a three-page
briefing paper obtained by The
Associated Press raises ques-
tions about whether the utility
and regulators were too compla-
cent about studies that suggest-
ed a tsunami could overwhelm
the defenses at the 40-year-old
Fukushima Dai-ichi plant.
It also highlights Japan's
slow pace of decision-making on
an issue that experts had been
warning about for at least 20
months.

Battle in Mass.
senate race
emblematic of
national debate
BOSTON (AP) - The debate
over the line between religious
freedom and federal health care
mandates has made its way into
Massachusetts' closely watched
U.S. Senate race, with Republi-
can Sen. Scott Brown accusing
his chief Democratic rival of
wanting to "dictate to religious
people about what they should
believe."
Consumer advocate and Har-
vard professor Elizabeth War-
ren has responded by criticizing
Brown for signing on to a Repub-
lican-backed bill that would
allow employers and health care
plans to deny coverage for any
service they say violates their
moral or religious beliefs.
"This is a completely new
attack that threatens everyone's
health care," Warren said yester-
day. "This bill would allow any
employer or insurance company
to refuse to cover anyone for any-
thing."
Brown, however, said Warren
is trying to stifle religious liber-
ties by supporting a proposal
from President Barack Obama
that would allow workers at reli-
gious affiliated institutions to get
free contraception directly from
insurers.
"Now, it is Harvard Profes-
sor Elizabeth Warren who has
assumed the mantle of oppres-
sor," Brown said in a statement.
"She and her allies on the left are
dictating to Catholics and other
people of faith that they must do
as they are told when it comes
to health care or face the conse-
quences."

Brown has intensified his crit-
icism of Warren by invoking the
memory of the late Democratic
U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, a
Catholic who held the same Sen-
ate seat for nearly a half-century
before his death from brain can-
cer in 2009.
In a letter to Pope Benedict
XVI that year, a dying Kennedy
wrote of his support for "a con-
science protection for Catholics
in the health field.". Kennedy
made the statement in the con-
text of the debate over Obama's
national health care bill.
"Like Ted Kennedy, I support
areligious conscience exemption
in health care," said Brown, who
won the 2010 special election to
fill Kennedy's seat.
The invocation of the Kenne-
dy name is designed to resonate
in a state with a high number of
Catholic voters, some of whom
may disagree with their church
on the contraception issue but
could be sensitive to the question
of religious freedom.
Neither Brown nor Warren is
Catholic.
The fight stems from an
effort by Obama to require
church-affiliated employers to
pay for birth control for their
workers.
That effort met with stiff
resistance from Catholic lead-
ers who said it would force
them to violate the teachings of
the church, which opposes con-
traception.
Obama has offered what he
says is a compromise that would
allow workers at religious insti-
tutions to get free contraception
directly from health insurers.
The offer has failed to satisfy
church leaders.
The top U.S. Catholic bishop
has vowed to fight the compro-
mise in Congress and through
the courts.

Vending away stigma
Women benefit from easier Plan B distribution
Contrary to what campus tour guides may lead parents to
believe, college students do in fact have sex. Because of this
unsurprising truth, it's extremely important for colleges to
ensure that they provide students, especially women, with adequate
resources to help prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies. In the
event a woman finds herself unfortunately in need of Plan B, an oral
contraceptive that can be taken after sex, colleges such as Shippens-
burg University of Pennsylvania provide a much needed and appreci-
ated service: selling the emergency contraceptive in a vending machine
located inside the school's health clinic. Even if it helps a minority of
students, removing the embarrassment or negative stigma that sur-
rounds obtaining emergency contraception is a valuable cause.

Golden exper

y last column, "Numbers
can Lie," recommend-
ed listening to experts
whenever one
is confused by
economic data.
But, this isn't
restricted to eco-
nomic data. It's
common sense to
observe experts'
opinions and
defer to experts MATTHEW
whenever they ZABKA
express unani-
mous consent on
an issue.
People heed this common sense
in most subjects. For example,
physicists have unanimously dis-
credited truthers' claims that some-
thing other than airplanes brought
down the Twin Towers. Docu-
ment experts, even conservative
Fox News document experts, have
debunked birthers' claims that Pres-
ident Barack Obama's birth certifi-
cate had been forged. Even though
most people don't understand the
exact physics behind the Towers'
collapse or the intricacies of legal
documents, rational people trust
experts, and truthers and birthers
are thus regarded as more interested
in personal vendettas than facts.
While discussions that challenge
physicists and document experts
are mostly confined to conspiracy
theorists' chat rooms, discussions
that challenge economists are gain-
ing a greater say in policy discus-
sions. An example of this is the
discussions about reintroducing
the gold standard.
A bit of background: The gold
standard is a monetary system in
which a country either uses gold as
currency or agrees to sell gold for a
fixed amount of a circulating cur-
rency, which effectively pegs a cur-
rency to the price of gold. If markets,
instead of gold, determine a curren-
cy's value, the currency is said to be
a fiat currency.
For most of history, nations have
either used a gold or silver standard.
After the Second World War, West-
ern nations decided to peg their

exchange rates to the U.S. dollar,
which was pegged to gold. This cre-
ated a gold standard for most of the
Western world. In 1971, the United
States ended the dollar's peg to gold
and instead floated its currency on
the market. As a result, the Western
world's gold standard ended, and
most Western nations adopted fiat
currencies. Since 1971, the dollar's
value has been determined the same.
way a bicycle's value is determined:
by the free market.
Now some politicians, presiden-
tial candidate Ron Paul in particular,
want to reintroduce the gold stan-
dard. These gold standard propo-
nents present several arguments in
favor of the gold standard.
For example, if a government
prints too much money it leads to
inflation. Since a currency pegged to
gold must maintain a certain value,
a gold standard limits the amount of
currency that may be printed. Thus
proponents see the gold standard as
an effective way to limit inflation.
Some also note that a gold standard
leads to stability in exchange rates
between nations using a gold stan-
dard and claim this stabijity is good
for the economy. They further claim
a gold standard can limit the amount
of debt a country may issue, which
would act as a barrier to deficit
spending.
opponents of a gold standard,
on the other hand, note that peg-
ging a currency to gold or anything
else limits the monetary policies a
nation's central bank can take. They
point to Greece as a good example of
currency pegging gone wrong.
Greece is entering its fifth year of
recession. Were Greece still using
the drachma, its central bank could
take measures to devalue the cur-
rency. A cheaper currency would
lead to increased Greek exports,
which would help bring Greece out
of recession.
But Greece adopted the Euro in
2001, which effectively pegged its
currency to that of other euro zone
nations. By doing so, Greece surren-
dered its ability to control monetary
policies to the European Central
Bank. This currency peg is part of

tise
the reason why Greece's recession
has continued, with an unemploy-
ment rate of nearly 20 percent and
massive cuts to public services that
are hurting the average Greek..
With both sides of the gold stan-
dard discussion presenting interest-
ing, albeit complicated, arguments,
it's important to consider experts'
opinions regarding the gold stan-
dard. The University of Chicago
Booth School of Business regularly
polls 40 economists from top uni-
versities on economic questions.
The poll's creators have chosen
economists from across the political
spectrum to include a wide range of
political theories.
Why trust
chemists but
not economists?
One recent poll asked the econo-
mists to evaluate the following
statement: "If the U.S. replaced
its discretionary monetary policy
regime with a gold standard, defin-
ing a 'dollar' as a specific number of
ounces of gold, the price-stability
and employment outcomes would be
better for the average American."
Every single economist polled
either disagreed with the state-
ment or strongly disagreed. That is,
experts agree that reinstating the
gold standard is a horrible idea. But
despite economists' uniform oppo-
sition, a reintroduction of the gold
standard is still being discussed.
Today, any attempt to turn coal
into gold would be seen as a little
silly, because society respects chem-
ists' opinions that such an attempt
won't work. Perhaps in time econo-
mists' opinions will receive equal
recognition.

Shippensburg has been selling Plan B along
with decongestants, condoms and pregnancy
tests for two years in a vending machine inside
the school's health center. Recently, the vend-
ing machine has attracted national media
attention as critics expressed concern that
individuals under the age of 17 might be pur-
chasing Plan B in violation of a recent Obama
administration decision requiring prescrip-
tions for young adults to buy the pill. People
who enter the health clinic must sign in to
ensure they're a student, and Shippensburg
says all its students meet the age requirement.
Shippensburg has decided to keep the machine
for the time being, but has invited the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to investigate.
There's a certain stigma attached to buy-
ing Plan B - the necessity of emergency
contraception is viewed by some as irrespon-
sible or negligent. However, the need for
using Plan Bisn't always within a woman's
control. If contraceptives fail or a woman is
forced into sex, she is unfairly left with the
burden, and possibly shame, of an unwanted
pregnancy. In such instances, access to Plan
B can be important to preserve the woman's
mental and physical health. Providing this.
contraceptive in a vending machine in a more
private setting lessens the interactions nec-
essary to obtain it. This simple fact could be a
deciding factor for a woman to obtain Plan B.
The vending machine also sells Plan B at
a cheaper price than most pharmacies. Set at
the cost that the university pays to the phar-

maceutical company, Plan B is offered for
$25. At the University of Michigan's Univer-
sity Health Services, it costs $40. Arguments
that cheaper prices will encourage youth to
have unprotected sex are irrational. Instead,
it makes it more economical if a woman
requires emergency contraceptives.
While vending machines may have a casu-
al and unprofessional connotation, perhaps
a reason for the sudden media attention, a
vending machine placed in a university's
health clinic is appropriate. It provides pri-
vacy that many women desire when dealing
with matters of reproductive health. The
vending machine has been in place for two
years with generally favorable reception.
Eight-five percent of Shippensburg students
support this idea according to a university-
wide survey. Shippensburg should be com-
mended for listening to its students and
subsequently providing Plan B in a conve-
nient and safe manner. If this is a service that
students desire and use responsibly, Ship-
pensburg should continue providing it.
Having to take Plan B isn't the ideal situ-
ation. For many women, it's embarrassing,
costly and, most importantly, a last resort. In
a time when women are already in a stressful
situation, any option that makes this process
easier should be explored by all colleges. If
this vending machine makes the decision to
obtain emergency contraception less stress-
ful for just one woman, it serves a critical
purpose.

ADITYA SATHI|
Contilue (M)Forward

For the past two Central Student Govern-
ment presidential elections, members of MFor-
ward have been grateful for the confidence that
students have placed in their candidates. Just
a few weeks ago, I was honored and humbled
to receive the MForward nomination for CSG
president. After careful consideration, I'm
proud to announce that I have selected Louis
Mirante as my CSG running mate. Louis has
an extensive history of achievement in student
government, and I am confident he brings the
experience and skills necessary to serve as vice
president. This March, MForward is again ask-
ing for your trust and your support.
This past year, other MForward members
and I worked diligently with the Student,
Association of Michigan (SAM) to lobby for
higher education- funding from the state.
While the previous budget was marked with
a $58 million decrease in funding for the Uni-
versity, due to the collaboration of CSG, SAM
and the President's Council, Governor Rick
Snyder recently proposed a 3-percent increase
in funding for education. Members of MFor-
ward strongly believe that the most effective
way to keep the University affordable is to
ensure adequate state support. Sadly, Michi-
gan currently has one of the worst records for
supporting education, but we know it doesn't
have to be that way. We recognize the work
cannot stop now, and the relationships that
we built with the state government cannot be
lost. This is why MForward is proposing the
creation of a permanent CSG executive posi-
tion that would act as a government relations
officer. This position would not only continue
our lobbying efforts for education, but also
actively work to increase those efforts as well.
MForward is also working on a medical
amnesty policy that would protect students
from receiving Minor in Possession of alco-
hol charges when calling for help for friends
who need treatment due to alcohol poison-
ing. Under state law, a student who calls
for an intoxicated friend is also in danger of
receiving legal punishment if they have been
drinking. A medical amnesty law would not
only incentivize the request for help, but also

would, best of all, help save the lives of stu-
dents in danger.
But, MForward isn't confined to only these
issues. Our focus has been and always will be
this campus and how to make everyday life
better for students. This year, we are looking
at ways to reorganize the Student Organiza-
tion Account Services, as well as improve stu-
dent organization funding, in order to make
it easier for student groups to finance their
events and ideas. In addition, we will work
with other organizations to implement a bike
share program on campus that would allow
students greater convenience for getting
across campus. Most importantly, though,
we'll work to rebuild and expand the What to
Fix (WTF) campaign to ensure that student
government is addressing issues that you, as
students, want to see addressed.
We remain today because we are the same
party we were founded as. We remain today
because we are the only party solely focused
on the interests of students and being an advo-
cate for those needs, not swayed by national
politics or causes that take us away from that
focus. Our success is driven by our dedication
and hard work, our belief in representative
diversity and transparency in governing, as
well as our never-ending commitment to all of
these values. We remain because although we
have had success, MForward is determined
to continually work for the betterment of stu-
dents here at the University of Michigan.
MForward is about results for students and
nothing less. We have no desire for meaning-
less rhetoric. We emphasize collaboration
over combativeness and innovation over idle-
ness because this has been the proven path to
working with the administration and achiev-
ing real results. MForward will never lose
sight of its role as the advocate for students.
This March, we hope that you will continue
your support for MForward, so MForward
can continue working for you.
Aditya Sathi is an LSA junior. He is the
MForward presidential candidate and the
vice speaker of the Student Assembly.

T his past weekend, I, along
with members of my fra-
ternity, Phi Sigma Pi, trav-
eled to Detroit.
We were vol-
unteering with
the non-profit
organization
Blight Busters."
Wanting to cre-
ate a more posi-
tive community JASON
for his children,
John George PANG JAO
founded Blight
Busters 18 years
ago to revive communities in North-
west Detroit by demolishing dilapi-
dated buildings and building new
houses and community centers.
Today, Blight Busters has worked
with more than 120,000 volunteers
to create millions of dollars worth of
homes and facilities. They have even
collaborated with The White House
Fellows - a program of fellowships
to senior White House staff - on
renovation projects in Detroit and
have been recognized by President
Barack Obama.
Non-profit organizations like
Blight Busters exist everywhere. At
the University of Michigan alone,
there are numerous outstanding
examples of quality non-profits.
These include GlobeMed, Habitat
for Humanity and Students for Edu-
cational Equality. You may have
worked on numerous service proj-
ects in school. You may even work to
create your own non-profit organi-
zation in college or after graduation.
But how does someone take his or
her passion and turn it into a viable
solution for the societal issues we
face? We turn to the experts in the
industry for some insights.
I fortunately had the opportu-
nity to chat with George. An ener-
getic and kind-hearted man, George
spoke to me about his experience
building Blight Busters.
"I started the organization for
my children so that they can grow
up in a community without all the
negative things surrounding them,"
George said. "We certainly face(d)
challenges at first, like raising dol-

lars and keeping volunteers moti-
vated."
George went on to explain that his
organization motivates volunteers
by giving them a holistic view of the
communities they work for, provid-
ing fulfilling and hands-on projects
and, after completion of the projects,
showing volunteers the .tangible
impacts they made.
"We believe if we keep showing
the good will and provide visible
results such as the increase in home
ownership and local businesses, the
volunteers will be driven and feel a
strong connection with what they
are doing."
George added that his organiza-
tion has collaborated with a number
of organizations at the University and
is actively recruiting for volunteers.
In addition to having a strong,
motivated team, non-profits also
depend on the same organizational,
technological and financial infra-
structure that serves as the foun-
dation of for-profit organizations.
Apple, whose stock topped $500 this
week, is a good example.
Its late CEO, Steve Jobs, proposed
that managers should take owner-
ship in the.creative process and not
rely on the people who you set out
to help and serve. Henry Ford once
said, "If Ihad asked people what they
wanted, they would have said faster
horses." Another example would be
Zara, the Spanish clothing retailer.
The company's store specialists use
PDAs and other electronic devices'
to communicate directly with Zara's
supply chain and designers. This
allows them to report changes in
consumer taste on a real-time basis,
providing Zara with a powerful
competitive advantage.
Financially, non-profit organi-
zations aren't as concerned about
profit figures like return on invest-
ment and pre-tax income. Instead,
they focus on fulfilling their orga-
nizational missions - demolishing
old buildings or making Detroit into
a better city. Having acknowledged
their focus, managers of non-profits
should then create sets of financial
statements that help them make
decisions. On creating financial

statements, I recommend reading
Part IV of the article "How to Ana-
lyze Non-profit Financial Perfor-
mance" by Harvard University Prof.
Peter Frumkin.
Non-profits
should measure
growth, efficieny.
With financial information, man-
agers should then set objectives
and goals for their organizations.
Metrics for measuring performance *
vary for non-profits with different
charitable missions but each involve
measurements of absolute and rela-
tive effectiveness, efficiency, growth
and liquidity. Take tree planning as
an example. Managers are interest-
ed in how many trees they planted
(absolute effectiveness), how they
are performing with respect to peers
with similar size and mission (rela-
tive effectiveness), how much time it
takes to plant a tree (efficiency), how
many more trees and how much fast-
er they can plant trees this year com-
pared to previous years (growth)
and how well the non-profit can pay
back its debt obligation and afford
mandatory expenses like rent and
wages (liquidity).
Managing a non-profit organiza-
tion can be as challenging as man-
aging any for-profit company. It's
vital that managers of non-profits
know how to motivate their per-
sonnel and volunteers, create a
sustainable organizational and
technological infrastructure and
use financial information to help
set goals and evaluate performance.
There is a plethora of resources
available that you can use to help
your cause.
If your organization would like
to volunteer for Blight Busters, call
(313) 255-4355.

DONORS
From Page 1A
Kappa sorority members will
work with DKMS Americas, a
donor recruitment center, help-
ing students, faculty and staff
members register for the Be The
Match Registry today from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Anderson
AB Room in the Union.
LSA senior Samira Monav-
vari, Lee's friend, has been
working to promote today's
event via Facebook and has
received more than 1,000 con-
firmed attendees. Monavvari
said she hopes to be able to help
someone else in need of a trans-
plant, even if she doesn't find a
match for Lee.
"The fact that Dan is going
through this makes us want to
donate to people who we don't
even know because it's so hard
seeing what he's going through,"
Monavvari said.
According to Monavvari, Lee
is known jokingly by his friends
as "the next Steve Jobs," adding
that he is extremely smart, driv-

"If you ask him what he wants
to do, he'll always say he wants
to be known for something,"
Monavvari said. "He is the kind
of kid who gets along with every-
one ... that's why (his diagnosis)
has touched everyone so much."
LSA junior Jessica Kaltz, a
member of Sigma Kappa, started
organizing the drive prior to
Lee's diagnosis. Kaltz worked
with Christian Montgomery,
a University alum and DKMS
Americas employee, over the
past few months to organize the
registry at the University.
She wrote in an e-mail inter-

utes of their time by signing up
to become a donor, they could
possibly be the life-saving dif-
ference that Dan needs," Kaltz
wrote.
Montgomery explained that
the process for joining the reg-
istry involves having potential
donors fill out a short form and
then submit a cheek swab to
determine their tissue type.
Potential donors will then be
added to the Be The Match Reg-
istry, a national list of potential
bone marrow donors.
If the donor is contacted as a
match and decides to continue
with the process, he or she will
be required to take a blood test
in order to obtain the best match
for the patient in need.
Between four and six weeks
later, the donor will undergo a
marrow extraction procedure or
peripheral blood stem cell dona-
tion, depending on the patient's
condition. Contrary to popular
belief, the donor typically does
not experience significant pain,
a common misconception about
the two procedures, Montgom-
ery said.
Montgomery is not only a
DKMS employee, but also a bone
marrow donor himself. In 2007,
he registered at an event in the
Diag, and in January 2008 he
was contacted as a potential
match for a 22-year-old female
in New Jersey suffering from
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo-
binuria, a rare blood disease.

to whom Montgomery made his
donation, said her disorder was
discovered through blood work
that was required as part of the
process of becoming a dental
assistant.
Montgomery donated
through marrow extraction in
May 2008, a procedure that he
said left him a bit stiff and sore
for a few days. After receiving a
one-month, six-month and one-
year update, Montgomery and

said.
Goldberg was accepted to the
University in the fall, but didn't
start his freshman year until the
winter semester due to issues
with substance abuse. He said
he recently celebrated his sixth
month of sobriety.
Goldberg said he he would like
to be open about his recovery, but
wished his professors and .GSIs
wouldn't differentiate him from
other students when he confessed
his condition.
Keyes, who has been sober for
seven months and is currently
working in a neuroscience lab
on drug addiction, agreed with
Goldberg that it's difficult at
times to determine how peers
or professors may perceive her if
they knew about her past.
"In my lab, I work with
amphetamine every day and
have access to space where they
store heroin and cocaine," she
said. "I'm pretty well respected
in the lab by now, but if I were to
Laurie Alexander, the
associate University librar-
ian for learning and teaching,

was responsible for organizing
the event and explained that the
display will allow the libraries
to further connect to University
research.
"Research is central to the Uni-
versity libraries mission and it
permeates our daily lives, yet we
often don't have the opportunity
to gather to appreciate our con-
tribution to the broader academic
community," 'Alexander said.

Mausteller agreed to exchange
contact information. They have
been in contact since February
2010 and remain good friends.
"He's my hero," Mausteller
said. "I hope he's forever in my
life, not because he gave me his
bone marrow, but I hope we're
friends forever."
May 2012 will mark the four-
year anniversary of Mausteller's
transplant. Now completely
cured, Mausteller said it is very
important that people join the
registry to give a patient like
herself a second chance at life.
"I really didn't think I was
going to find a donor," she said.
"(Especially) with younger
(patients), they have their whole
lives to live and if you can do
something to help them, you
should do it."
Montgomery said the possi-
bility of saving someone's life far
outweighed the mild discomfort
he experienced.
"Really, what this comes
down to is if you get a call and
are told that you could save
someone's life in exchange for a
few days of being sore or feeling
flu-ish, would you do it?" Mont-
gomery asked. "If the answer is
'yes,' then there's no reason not
to register."
LSA freshman Sam Oshinsky
also joined the registry in April
2011 while touring another uni-
versity and donated peripheral
blood stem cells in January. He
said he was surprised to be
contacted so soon after join-
ing the registry, but donating
to a female patient in need was
life changing, adding that he is
expected to learn more details
about the patient's condition at
the one-month update.
"It has been an incred-
ible experience to go through,"
Oshinsky said. "While you
might go through a little pain,
the good I was able to do - and
hopefully save this girl's life -
was all worth it."
tell them I'm a recovering addict,
I don't know how they would
react."
Keyes expressed that she had
to work harder than most peo-
ple in order to live a normal life,
adding that she did not want to
worry about the stigma of being
an addict during the process.
"People's general idea of an
addict is some dude with a brown
paper bag walking down the
street in a gutter shooting up
heroin or something," she said.
"That was never my life."
Keyes explained that she was
tryingto portray the image of the
addict in recovery and did not
want to be compared with other
types of addicts that are inactive
and aren't seeking recovery.
The students also shared sev-
eral difficulties of living in Ann
Arbor and attending the Uni-
versity, most notably the issue
of being surrounded by a college
environment that encourages
alcohol consumption.
Keyes said she missed the

allow me to ask the kinds of ques-
tions that I wanted to ask," Sam-
son said. "So I just started writing
this code to allow students to
respond to a wider range of ques-
tions."
Nursing Prof. Ellen Smith said
she incorporates LectureTools
into her class in order to better
engage her students. She added
that she a hopes to improve stu-
dent perceptions of her class,
which previously received low
student reviews at the end of the
semester.
"The class evaluations have
now improved dramatically,"
Smith said. "There are definite-
ly students who say that they
have really enjoyed the Lecture-
Tools, and it has kept them more
engaged. SoI think that definitely
has been a plus."
Sociology Prof. Terrence
McGinn added that the question-
asking feature of LectureTools
allows students who may feel
uncomfortable participating in a
large classroom setting to partici-
pate without feeling pressured.
Nursing sophomore Shelby
Epstine said the program has
helped her to feel more at ease
participating in large lectures.
"(LectureTools) allows you to

showing that the hospital report-
ed the incident to DPS on Nov. 21.
According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice's website, the FBI
typically handles child pornogra-
phy cases, but Frost said jurisdic-
tions overlap in many cases.
"If we're asked to assist any
law enforcement organization,
we're certainly going to provide
our assistance," Frost said.
U.S. Attorney Matthew Roth
will represent the federal govern-
ment in the case. Roth could not
ask a question and then the GSI
is able to answer it," Epstine said.
"This is helpful for me because
questions are answered right on
the spot."
Smith said one of the drawbacks
to LectureTools is that participa-
tion in activities requires students
to have laptops or cell phones.
They must have power for their
devices for long periods of time,
as well as access to an Internet
connection or cell phone signal -
which is often difficult for large
lecture halls to accommodate -
according to Smith.
"Sometimes (my students are)
taking notes via LectureTools on
the Web, and they lose their Inter-
net connection," Smith said. "Or,
I'm asking them a question in class
- and they get credit for class par-
ticipation - and so the technology
has to work in order for that tobe
effective as a technique, and some-
times it doesn't work."
LSA sophomore Katarina Fabre
agreed that the LectureTools
technology has been somewhat
unreliable and difficult to use in
University lecture halls.
"(LectureTools) tends to be
very glitchy, and sometimes slides
are hidden and won't unhide,"
Fabre said. "It can be very frus-
trating and just slows down the
whole lecture."

ed by Ann Arbor attorney Joseph

case, adding that the state charg-
es will most likely be dismissed at
Jenson's preliminary exam today
in Ann Arbor District Court.
to allow students who do not have
laptops or are not connected to
the Internet to participate in the
activities on their mobile phones:
Additionally, Samson said
his team has come up with two
potential solutions, both of which
would allow students to access
full lecture notes offline.
"One (idea) is simply a button
where at the end of class you can
save everything as a PDF, so you
can have your slides and your
notes and you can download them
to your computer, and when you
don't have Internet connection
you can study offline," Samson
said.
Samson added thatanother idea
to provide students with offline
access to notes would involve giv-
ing professors the option of auto-
matically e-mailing a PDF file
complete with slides and notes to
the class for future reference.
Samson said he hopes to have
a solution to fix the Internet fail-
ures in classrooms soon. He added
that LectureTools is undergo-
ing further development, and he
hopes that by next fall the website
will be incorporated into online
textbooks.
"As you're typing your notes in
class, we could be automatically
making hints or linkages between
the notes you're taking and the
information in your textbooks,"
Samson said. "We're just tryingto
think about what's next."
Keyes said she initially used
alcohol as a social lubricant
because the University has a sig-
nificant party culture.
"You should not think that
activities without alcohol are
'lame,"' she said. "You don't have
to be drunk all day to have fun."
Goldberg explained that
though he initially did not want
to be "that one guy" who broke
the mood by refraining from
drinking, he ultimately lost who
he considered his best friends
when he didn't participate.
"You figure out who your true
friends are," he said. "The people
in the program become your true
friends."
The panel of students empha-
sized that there does not need to
be a grand aim in life to recover
from addiction, but Cervi said
after her recovery, she began to
develop and exceed her goals.
"What recovery had given me
is hope, the opportunity for pos-
sibilities, and trust for myself,"
she said.

nightlife and added that she lives
with friends who still engage in
alcohol consumption and other
behaviors.
"There is alcohol in my freez-
er, and there are weed brownies
chilling on the counter," Keyes
said.
As a freshman, Goldberg said
not being able to go out to parties
and engage in typical collegiate
life last fall was tough at first.
"In the Notre Dame game, I
saw people who were wild," Gold-
berg said. "I was nearly in tears.
I wanted to drink so badly, and I
wanted to be part of it so badly."
Goldberg said the presence of
many young people in recovery
at the University has been help-
ful, explaining that most people
in the recovery program in his
hometown were over 40.
"You can relate (with similar-
aged peers) on so many levels," he
said. "It's like I found a home."
Cervi said she was surprised
that in Ann Arbor, she could not
drive two miles without running

into another member of the Col-
legiate Recovery Program, which.
helped her stay on track when
under pressure.
"It's like a little secret society,
it's a powerful connection," she
said. "Sometimes, that's all I need
to feel."
Smith agreed with Cervi, and
said her connection to individuals
in the program on campus keeps
her from using substances. She
also noted the tight-knit and sup-
portive environment to be a big
advantage.
"It's reassuringto see U-M pro-
fessors or other students working
at the University while recover-
ing from addiction," she said. "If
you want to get sober, all you need
to do is ask for help, there will be
people at your side."
Students also expressed that
the notion that one cannot have
an "authentic college experience"
without alcohol needs to change
and that other students should
also be open to talking about their
experiences.

"This event enables us to do so."
Alexanderaddedthat she hopes
studentswillfind inspirationfrom
the display as well.
"Say you're a student here and
you're studying - why you're here
is on the wall," Alexander said.
In her opening remarks, Alex-
ander thanked Catherine Soehner,
former director of the Shapiro Sci-
ence Library, for her efforts in the
display's creation and initiating
the project five years ago.
Sandra Arlinghaus, a professor
in the School of Natural Resourc-

es and Environment, expressed
excitement to see her own
research, which is also published
in Solstice: An Electronic Journal
of Geography and Mathematics,
hung in bright colors alongside
her colleagues' in the display.
"It's like going to a museum,"
said Arlinghaus.
Arlinghaus added that ' her
research display includes QR
codes, and she said she hopes stu-
dents will use their smart phones
to access her research and other
scientific work.

Foreclosure rate rises

Number of houses
taken by bank still
lower than 2011
levels
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Banks
took back more U.S. homes in
January than in the previous
month, the latest sign that fore-
closures are accelerating after
slowing sharply last year while
lenders sorted out foreclosure-
abuse claims.
Foreclosures rose 8 percent
nationally last month from
December, but were down 15 per-
cent from a year earlier, foreclo-
sure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc.
said Thursday.
Despite the annual decrease
at the national level, some states
posted sharp increases com-
pared to January 2011. In New
Hampshire, foreclosures jumped
62 percent. In Massachusetts, 75
percent.
That trend is expected to
strengthen this year in light of
last week's $25 billion settlement
between the nation's biggest
mortgage lenders and 49 state
attorneys general over the indus-

try's handling of foreclosures.
Many banks and mortgage
servicers processed foreclosures
without verifying documents.
Some employees signed papers
they hadn't read or used fake sig-
natures to speed foreclosures - a
practice dubbed "robo-signing."
Major banks temporarily put
foreclosures on hold after the
problems surfaced in the fall of
2010. Some had to refile previ-
ously filed foreclosure cases and
revisit pending cases to prevent
errors. Those delays and uncer-
tainty over state and federal
probes into the industry's fore-
closure practices led to a sharp
slowdown in foreclosure activity
last year.
The settlement between the
banks and state attorneys gen-
eral helps clarify the rules banks
must follow to foreclose on bor-
rowers, said Daren Blomquist,
a vice president at RealtyTrac.
That will pave the way for more
foreclosures, he said.
"The settlement will accel-
erate the foreclosures that are
happening this year and it will
accelerate the process of lend-
ers catching up on the backlog of
foreclosures that has been build-
ing up over the last year and a
half," Blomquist said.

in January *
Credit rating agency Fitch Rat-
ings also anticipates foreclosures
will climb nationallythisyear, but
not right away, noting it will take
some time for lenders and mort-
gage servicers to make sure they
are in compliance with the rules
set forth in the settlement.
"You probably are going to see
the pace pick up as the year goes
on," said Grant Bailey, a manag-
ing director at Fitch.
RealtyTrac projects foreclo-
sures will rise 25 percent this
year to I million homes. Last
year, lenders took back 804,000
homes
Even so, the rise in foreclo-
sures isn't expected to be uni-
form nationwide. That's because
the settlement isn't likely to ease
the backlog of foreclosure cases
in states where courts play a role
in the process.
In addition, some states have
taken steps to slow lenders down.
Throughout the housing *
downturn Nevada has had the
nation's highest foreclosure rate.
There, a law that went into effect
in October requires that foreclo-
sure documents must be filed in
the county where a property is
located and a lender must pro-
vide a notarized affidavit detail-
ing their legal right to proceed.

In a rally in Beirut, Lebanese anti-Syrian regime protestors hold a sign against Russia on February 5, 2012. Syria's
11-month-old crisis enflames emotions and strains the already deep divisions in neighboring Lebanon.
Assad calls for Syrian
votebut steps up assaults

Constitutional
referendum
criticized in light of
violence
BEIRUT (AP) - As Syrian
forces stepped up their assault
yesterday on rebellious cit-
ies, President Bashar Assad
ordered a referendum on a new
constitution that would create
a multiparty system in a coun-
try that has been ruled by his
autocratic family dynasty for
40 years.
Such a change would have
been unheard of a year ago, and
Assad's regime is touting the
new constitution as the cen-
terpiece of reforms aimed at
calming Syria's upheaval. But
after 11 months of bloodshed,
with well over 5,000 dead in
the regime's crackdown on
protesters and rebels, Assad's
opponents say the referendum
and reforms are not enough and
that the country's strongman
must go.
' "The people in the street
today have demands, and one
of these demands is the depar-
ture of this regime," said Khalaf
Dahowd, a member of the
National Coordination Body for
Democratic Change in Syria, an
umbrella for several opposition
groups in Syria and in exile.

The White House also dis-
missed the referendum. Press
secretary Jay Carney called
the move "laughable" in light
of ongoing brutality by the Syr-
ian military and said it "makes a
mockery" of the uprising.
Assad's call fora referendum,
set for Feb. 26, also raises the
question of how a nationwide
vote could be held at a time
when many areas see daily bat-
tles between Syrian troops and
rebel soldiers.
Regime forces yesterday bat-
tered rebellious neighborhoods
in the central city of Homs,
pushing ahead with one of the
deadliest assaults of the crack-
down that activists say has
killed hundreds in the past two
weeks, aimed at crushing a city
that has been a stronghold of
dissent. Black smoke billowed
from an oil pipeline in the city
that was hit in the fighting, with
each side blaming the other for
attacking it. Activists reported
at least eight killed across the
country yesterday.
Amendments to the consti-
tution once were a key demand
by the opposition at the start of
Syria's uprising, when protest-
ers first launched demonstra-
tions calling for change. Assad
has also talked of holding par-
liament elections after the ref-
erendum. But after months of
the regime's fearsome crack-
down, the opposition dismisses
any talk of reform, saying that

they don't believe Assad will
really loosen his iron grip on
power and that his ouster is the
only solution.
Russia, a top Syrian ally, has
presented Assad's reform prom-
ises as an alternative way to
resolve Syria's bloodshed. Ear-
lier this month, Moscow and
Beijing vetoed a Western- and
Arab-backed resolution at the
U.N. Security Council aimed at
pressuring Assad to step down.
The current Syrian consti-
tution enshrines Assad's Baath
Party as the leader of the state.
But according to the new draft,
"the state's political system is
based on political pluralism and
power is practiced democrati-
cally through voting."
The draft also says the presi-
dent can hold office only for a
maximum of two seven-year
terms. Assad, who inherited
power from his father, has been
in power for nearly 12 years.
His father, Hafez, ruled for 30
years.
The Syrian constitution has
been amended in the past -
most crucially, to allow Assad
to take power in 2000.
After his father's death, Par-
liament quickly lowered the
presidential age requirement
from 40 to 34 so that the rul-
ing Baath party could nominate
Bashar Assad. His appointment
was sealed by a nationwide ref-
erendum, in which he was the
only candidate.

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood
backs military in dispute with U.S.

Party says pro-
democracy groups
causing unrest
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's Muslim
Brotherhood yesterday threw its
weight behind the country's mil-
itary-backed government in an
escalating dispute with the U.S.
over the funding of pro-democra-
cy groups.
Cairo claims that the groups
are fomenting protests against
the country's military rulers, and
has referred 16 Americans and
27 others to criminal court. Six
Americans are barred from leav-
ing the country.
The dispute has shaken rela-
tions between the two countries,
with U.S. officials and legislators
threatening to cut aid to Egypt
- $L3 billion in military aid and
$250 million in economic assis-
tane - if the issue is notresolved.
On Wednesday, the Brother-
hood - whose political arm con-
trols the largest bloc of seats in
Egypt's parliament - praised

officials carrying out the crack-
down and said it supported their
"nationalist position."
The Brotherhood said it
"rejects all forms of pressure the
U.S. is exerting," the statement
published on the group's website
said.
The statement said the group
"declares that it, and the Egyptian
people, will not tolerate any offi-
cials if they decide to succumb to
the pressure or cover up the accu-
sations or interfere in the busi-
ness of the judiciary."
Egypt's ruling military council
has repeatedly alluded to plots by
foreign powers throughout the
last year. Critics see the allega-
tions as an attempt by the army
to deflect attention from what
they regard as a botched transi-
tion to democracy. The strongly-
worded statement by the Brothers
appears tobe an attempt to outbid
the military position.
The statement comes a day
after the state media published
the four-month old testimony of
the Cabinet minister in charge
of international cooperation in
which she lashed out at the main-

ly U.S.groups.
Minister Faiza Aboul Naga, a
leftover from deposed President
Hosni Mubarak's regime, accused
them ofusingthe foreign funds to
foment pro-democracy protests
against the country's militaryrul-
ers, who took over after Mubarak
was ousted in a popular uprising
a year ago.
The foreign funding affair has
also been interpreted by many
among Egypt's pro-democracy
groups as part of a larger plan to
neutralize rights groups and other
civil society organization, who
have long challenged Mubarak
and continue to challenge what
they say are grave rights viola-
tions by the militaryrulers.
Investigative judges have said a
second phase of the probe is look-
ing into Egyptian groups receiv-
ing foreign funds.
The Brotherhood, itself an
unregistered group, had previ-
ously backed the military's inves-
tigation of pro-democracy and
human rights groups.
"Civil ggoups are as much a
thorn in the side of any religious
group," as they are of an authori-
tarian regime, said Negad Borai, a
human rights lawyer.
The' Brotherhood's political
party swept recent elections,
taking nearly 50 percent of the
seats in the new parliament. Lib-
eral and secular activists who led
last year's popular uprising that
toppled Mubarak failed to win
significant strength in the parlia-
ment, and they are suspicious of
the Brotherhood, suspecting that
the veteran Islamist movement
is working with the military to
divvy up power while excluding
the more secular forces.
The military generals said they
will transferpower to a civilian by
end of June, while a constitution
will be written by a committee
nominated by a Brotherhood-
dominated parliament.
As the transition period nears
an end, many suspect the Broth-
erhood, although it has until now
sought to appease the military
rulers, will start playing hardball
to wrest as much power as pos-
sible from the powerful military
rulers.
, The group's deputy chairman
Khairat el-Shater told Al-Jazeera
television that U.S. aid should not
be conditional and should con-
tinue to flow as a"compensation"

Blue brings home hardware from LSU

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
After the Michigan softball
team lost ace Jordan Taylor
to graduation, the Wolverines
looked to their bullpen to find a
replacement for the record-set-
ting pitcher.
Last weekend, they just may
have found her.
Freshman pitcher Sara Dries-
enga earned her first two wins at
the LSU Tiger Classic in Baton
Rouge, La., pitching against Lou-
isiana Tech and No. 22 LSU.
On Friday, the right-hander
gave up two runs on two hits
in four innings, but Driesenga
came back Saturday and pitched
her first complete game, tallying
two strikeouts against the Tigers
- not to mention carrying a no-
hitter through five innings.
Her performance garnered
her co-Big Ten Freshman of the
Week honors, which she shared
with Iowa shortstop Megan
Blank, as well as a spot on the
All-Tournament team with three
other Wolverines.
Having to fill the large shoes
of Taylor - a current member of
USA Softball - is a tough task,
* but the seniors on the team have
faith in the freshman.
"I think (Driesenga is) really
confident in herself, which is
something pitchers have to be
in order to be successful," said
senior centerfielder Bree Evans.
"She's doing a really good job on
moving the ball and hitting the

Becca Garfinkel. Sweet trades
time with sophomore Caitlin
Blanchard and started against
Louisiana Tech and LSU last
weekend.
"Lauren (is) just awesome
to be around," Chidester said.
"(She's) a hard worker and she
competes. She's very athletic and
it's great to have that confidence
behind the plate."
Garfinkel joined the team as a
walk-on. Though she hasn't seen
much game action, Garfinkel has
an important role warming up
Michigan's pitchers as the bull-
pen catcher.
STAYING CLASSY: On
Wednesday, Evans was named
one of 30 candidates for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS.Award.
Her selection for the Senior
CLASS Award comes after Evans
was named to the Watch List for
USA Softball Player of the Year
before the season.
In order to qualify for the
award, "a student-athlete must
be classified as an NCAA Divi-
sion I senior and have notable
achievements in four areas of
excellence - community, class-
room, character and competi-
tion," according to the Senior
CLASS Award website.
Evans was a 2011 Academic
All-Big Ten selection and has
raised over $140,000 for breast
cancer research and awareness,
in addition to her consistent on-
field production.
The finalists will be narrowed
down to 10 later in the season.

Senior centerfielder Bree Evans was one of 30 athletes named to the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award qualifying list this week. She was a 2011 Academic All -ig Te npick.

corners. She's letting the defense
help her and she's doing her part
on the team."
Senior third-baseman Aman-
da Chidester, who was also
named to the All-Tournament
team,agreed with Evans.
"I can't wait to see her get bet-
ter and better every game," she
said. "You can tell she loves the
game, (and) I definitely think
(she can put us over the top) if

she continues to improve. She
can definitely have an impact on
our team."
Driesenga has already made
her mark on the team in her very
first week of varsity action and
has a promising career ahead of
her.
She and the rest of the squad
will be back in action this week-
end when they travel to Boca
Raton, Fla. to play in the Florida

Atlantic Kickoff Classic.
MORE FRESH MEAT: In addi-
tion to Driesenga, the Wolver-
ines have three other freshmen
on the squad, including another
freshman pitcher who has shown
similar potential to Driesenga.
Lefty Haylie Wagner also
saw action this past weekend,
relieving Driesenga in the match
against Louisiana Tech.
She also made her first start

against Penn State, recording
11 strikeouts in the five-inning
game.
Chidester sees the same
potential in Wagner that she
does in Driesenga.
"I think her and'*Sara will
work well with each other," she
said. "She's just got to keep com-
ing out (and) working hard."

Wolverines look to
start strong in 2012

Rough start for 'M' in Puerto Rico

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
Bo Schembechler's famous
words, "Those who stay will be
champions," linger. But Schem-
bechler never acknowledged
what happens next. It's those
who stay after they claim their
prize that remain champions.
Michigan coach Rich Maloney
and his current fifth-year seniors
were the Big Ten champions in
2008. But last season, they fin-
ished dead last, with a 17-37 over-
all record.
Still, they stayed, and they're
back this reason, ready to "Flip
It." Maloney introduced the team
motto at the Junge Family Cham-
pions Center during Wednesday's
Meet the Wolverines Night. It
came in the form of a coin, rep-
resenting the 180-degree turn-
around it hopes to achieve.
"From last to first," said senior
catcher Coley Crank. "We don't
really want to dwell on last year."
The Wolverines start out with
a blank slate. But their fresh start
began as soon as the last pitch
was thrown in last May. It signi-
fied the end of misfortune and
the beginning of rehabilitation.
Maloney and the team picked
themselves up, remaining confi-
dent in "the system."
The Wolverines made a few
minor changes to their program,
hut continued to follow Malo-
ney's mantra, "Keep it simple,
stupid."
During his years at Western
Michigan University, Maloney
found himself, so to speak, "In
Search of Excellence," both liter-
ally and in literature. Struggling
with the book's concepts, he took
away only one sentence and it
became his philosophy.
He took that phrase and dis-
sected it into two parts: funda-
mentals and greatness.
With the first, he recognizes
the importance of mastering the
basics.
"Make the routine play rou-
tinely," Maloney said, quoting
former Wolverine Barry Larkin.
He then elaborated on the sec-
ond half, describing greatness as
the "'Work hard and then some'
mentality."
So, to maintain simplicity,
Maloney prepared for a new year
and brought back a familiar face.
Pitching coach Steve Merriman
returned to Michigan's coaching
staff after spending much of his
career in the major leagues.
Merriman came to Michigan
for single-season appearances in

1995 and 2002. The Wolverines
hope that he's here to stay.
Sophomore outfielder Michael
O'Neill has a personal rela-
tionship with Merriman, who
scouted O'Neill when he was a
high-school player. O'Neill feels
that the coach's professional atti-
tude will onlybenefit the team.
O'Neill, along with junior out-
fielder Patrick Biondi and senior
right-hander Brandon Sinnery,
was recently named the Big Ten
Conference's Baseball Players
to Watch list. They earned their
spotsbecause of their strong indi-
vidual performances last season,
even though they were for a los-
ing team.
In his rookie year, O'Neill
recorded a .301 batting average
while starting all 54 games for
the Wolverines. More notably, he
also led the league with 30 sto-
len bases, which broke Biondi's
freshman record. Michigan had
the one-two punch in that catego-
ry, with Biondi trailing by three.
But Biondi is not concerned with
the numbers or ranks - he's just
anxious to get on base.
And he'll have his first oppor-
tunity to do so, at the Big Ten-
Big East Challenge against
Pittsburgh, Seton Hall and West
Virginia this weekend. All of
those teams rank significantly
higher than Michigan.
But the Wolverines will take
the chip on their shoulders south
to Florida with the confidence
and expectation to sweep.
"If you don't go in with that
expectation, you're probably
going to lose them all," Sinnery
said.
The right-handed pitcher post-
ed an ERA of 2.91 over 68 innings
last season. He took the mound
as the team's ace, after seniors
Kolby Wood and Travis Smith
were injured in the first week of
spring action. That leadership
translated into his recent election
as one of the four team captains.
"I serve as just another life-
line," Sinnery said. "But with that
honor comes a lot of responsibil-
ity."
Wood was renamed co-cap-
tain, though he and Smith are
still finishing their recover-
ies. Maloney said they're nearly
healthy and pitching in the low
90-mph range.
There are a lot of factors that
played a part in last season's trou-
bles. But Michigan is ready for
redemption.
"(We want) to prove people
wrong," said O'Neill. "(We want)
to show people it was a fluke."

Sparks generating heat*

TODD NEEDLE/Daly
Members of the Michigan football team cheer at Michigan's victory over Indiana at Crisler Center earlier this season.
At 14-0 Blue continues
to protect homecourt

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
When the No. 5 Michigan
hockey team trekked to play
Northern Michigan for the first
CCHA series of the season, junior
forward Lindsay Sparks was, well,
the team's spark.
On that October weekend in
Marquette, he commanded the
team's offense, scoring two goals
and recording two assists while
skating on the third line.
After the first five games of
the season, Sparks was leading
Michigan in points. Now, Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson is ques-
tioning whether he should even
be in a lineup. Sparks has been in
a slump since the Wolverines' los-
ing streak in November.
The team broke out of its funk.
But Sparks is still in the middle of
his - and he's been payingfor it.
"He definitely started off the
season with a little bit of a 'wow'
factor," Berenson said. "Then, it
just slipped. Whether he lost his
confidence, lost his touch, (I don't
know, but) he ended up out of the
lineup."
The fact that Sparks was hav-
ing difficulty finding the back of
the net has nothing to do with
his lack of playing time: Berenson
scratched him for eight games
because of his minus-five plus/
minus streak earlier in the year.
Berenson can accept that play-
ers don't always score - as long
as they can adapt and become
two-way forwards. But when
they become a defensive liability,
it becomes a problem. Sparks has
gotten the message.
"I've definitely tried to be more
defensively minded," Sparks said.
"It's not really about points for
me, it's really about keeping the
other team from scoring now."
Sparks still hasn't accumulated
any points since being reinstated
into the lineup on Jan.20, but he's
starting to make his presence felt
again. He's currently on the third
line with freshman Zack Hyman
and sophomore Luke Moffatt.
Against Michigan State last
weekend, Sparks had four shots
on goal. He didn't convert, but

Junior forward Lindsay Sparks has worked his way hack onto the third line.

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
You can talk about Zack Novak
all you want, but ex-NFL defen-
sive end Eric Ogbogu is the unof-
ficial heart and soul of the No. 17
Michigan basketball team. The
Wolverines don't realize this, and
Ogbogu himself certainly doesn't.
In fact, it's likely nobody recog-
nizes Ogbogu's underrated con-
tribution to the program.
The ultra-muscular former
benchwarmer became a phenom-
enon when Under Armour hired
Ogbogu to be its spokesman and
to star in its commercials.
Everyone remembers those
spots from several years back. The
Under Armour-clad Ogbogu ral-
lied his teammates before giving
one final admonition: "WE MUST
PROTECT THIS HOUSE!"
And though Michigan coach
John Beilein and his team prob-
ably didn't look to those com-
mercials as inspiration, they've
definitely taken the message to
heart. The Wolverines have been
determined to protect home court
thisseason. Refusingto lose at the
Crisler Center has been a theme
for the group "from day one," as
redshirt sophomore forward Jor-
dan Morgan put it.,
"We practice all the time on
this court," said junior guard
Matt Vogrich. "It's just a motto of
ours, 'Protect Crisler.' And we've
been trying to do that all year."
It's nothing new, really - keep-
ing opponents from besting you
on your own floor is a goal for all
teams. But the Wolverines have
been particularly adept at it, a fact
evident from their perfect 14-0
record at the Crisler Center.
That success extends into
last year, too. Michigan has won
15 straight home games, and
that mark would be 19 games if
it weren't for the last-second,

it's a good step forward for him
in Berenson's mind, especially
because Sparks has been making
strides defensively.
"If he can add some offense,
good," Berenson said. "He's got
to capitalize on his chances, and
thenhe's got to be agood two-way
player. That's what our third and
fourth lines are doing."
JUNIOR STANDING: All eyes
will be on the senior class this
weekend, when it takes to the ice
at Yost Ice Arena for the'last regu-
lar-season home series.
The seniors are the unques-
tioned leaders of the Wolveines,
but recently, the junior class has
been stealing the offensive thun-
der. And for Berenson, it's about
time.
"You can't stay the way you
were when you were a freshman
or a sophomore," Berenson said.
"The junior class has to take a big
step if we're going to be a good
team."
Berenson was specifically
referring to junior forward A.J.
Treais, who notched three goals
last weekend. Berenson proudly
proclaimed that Treais is finally
starting to look like the "man
amongst men" that he saw while
recruiting Treais from the U.S.
National Team Development

Program. On Monday, Berenson
repeated his age-old mantra: the
team with the best defense wins,
and it helps when all of the wol-
verines can contribute. The rest of
the second line is finally starting
to see that progress in Treais.
"He's been playing really well
defensively ... and that's led to
some offensive production," said
senior forward Luke Glendening.
"He gets to the open ice and he
gets great shots. He finds ways to
be open, soit's easy to get him the
puck."
HARD HITTERS: Even in physi-
calgames wrought with penalties,
there's one hit that junior forward
Chris Brown doesn't mind taking.
"Usually, my first shift of the
game, either I'm going to take a
big hit or I'm going to try and give
one," Brown said.
Brown intentionally lets him-
self get slammed into the boards?
"It's just something mentally
that's screwed up," he said. "If
someone hits me hard, I'm ready
for the game. I've done it ever
since I could start hitting."
NOTES: Though no official
announcement has been made,
Berenson confirmed that a game
against Cornell next season is
in the works. It is expected to be
played in New York.

BEATS BY 'U
Aspiring artists find opportunities at campus recording studios


Sean C'zarnecki -Daily Arts Writer
T he Duderstadt Center has something no other library
on campus can offer. Tucked behind tables full of engi-
neering students and a small army of computers, some
of the most technologically advanced recording studios inthe
world are available for students to capture the music they want
to create. Though the studios' many buttons and gadgets are
intimidating to the untrained eye, students can easily obtain
certification through a few courses the library offers. When
they're finished with their training, they can freely enter these
spaces.
Each studio is furbished with hardwood floors, and oddly
shaped boxes are strewn on the walls and ceiling for the prop-
er acoustics, though they might as well be surreal art pieces.
Complicated yet slick, the consoles look like pieces from "Star
Trek." At times, the studio almost seems luxuriously sci-fi.
If students want their sound to be compared to the work of
others, and maybe even be rewarded for their creativity, they
can enter a competition held by the University's record label,
Block M Records, whether they attend the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, or another school or college at the 'U.'
As with most institutions invested in technology, Block M
Records and the Duderstadt recording studios are changing

with the times and fine-tuning their methods to stay at the top
of their game.
As Senior Public Services Manager Glenda Radine said of
the studios, "Technology is constantly changing. We try to stay
as up-to-date, if not ahead of the curve, on technology."
For musicians on campus, the technology in the Duderstadt
is not something to be taken for granted. There are very few
places that freely offer world-class studios like the ones found
in this colossal library. Now, that may be just good-ol' fash-
ioned Michigan boasting, but to step inside the actual studios
and witness them for yourself - whoa.
Keeping up with the world of recording
Since their construction; the studios have undergone con-
stant renovation. As a current staff member, Audio Resources
Media Consultant Rishi Daftuar works in these studios every
day and knows every nook and cranny. And as a recent 'U' alum,
he has had the pleasure of watching his old workspace trans-
form and expand.
According to Radine, the studios were rebuilt this summer,

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"Memento"
There's nothing like a little Christopher Nolan
to get your brain fluids swirling. "Memento" is a
devious thriller about a man in pursuit of his wife's
alleged killer while suffering from.short-termmem-
ory loss. Every scene in this film is a heartbreaking
and mind-bending battle between deception and
vengeance, making "Memento" a masterpiece psy-
chological thriller you'll never tire of seeing.
NEWMARKET
"Maps" - The Front Bottoms
The Front Bottoms' vocalist Brian Sella sounds
a bit like he has come down with the uncommon
cold - indecipherable-Tom-Delonge-accent-itis.
Don't worry, it's not contagious, but "Maps" sure is.
Catchy with every strum, the songswells into a per-
feet three minutes of hand-clapping and off-kilter
background choruses. With optimism to carry lyr-
ics of heartbreak and regret, let "Maps" guide you
to your next lecture (and the one after that).

"Washington Crossing the
Delaware" - Emanuel Leutze
We live in America, but do we know what Amer-
ica is all about - the history, the art, the culture?If
not, what better way to be introduced than "Wash-

beginning of America's founding, but it can be
found at the center of the newly renovated Ameri-

Kyle Kramer,
Media Arts Master's student
What are the benefits of being in a program like media arts?
I think one of the greatest things you can get out of being in a
program like this in a creative department is the networking and
using the resources that are available to you.
Have you taken the class UARTS 250: "Creative Process"?
I'm not taking UARTS 250. I've heard great things about it; one of
my friends was in it, one of my thesis advisors taught it. I just hear
they have really interesting approaches to the creative process and
there's a lot of experimentation, a lot of play, and it just seems like
a great way to open up your creative process and get ideas going.

Challenged by the prospect of

ingredients stuffed in a floury,

for 88 cents. It served its purpose
- warm and filling, ready in two
minutes - but was utterly devoid
of the refined savoriness offered
by Marie's famous recipe.
Every once in a while, I was
lucky enough to discover a Marie
Callender's pot pie in the door
of our basement freezer, though
my mother could not bring
herself to routinely subject me
to the astoundingly poor nutri-
tion of the pot pies. The smaller,
10-ounce chicken pot pie boasts
70-percent of a daily allowance of
saturated fat and 42-percent of a
daily allowance of sodium (based
on a 2,000 calorie diet). The
larger, 16.5-ounce pie contains
over 1,000 calories and contains
100-percent of a daily allowance
of fat.

'FRIENDS' (1994), NBC

The legacy of Friends'

Like in the salons of 17th
and 18th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 10 years ago.
It may have run for 10 seasons.
It may have featured such unfor-
gettable gags as Ross dressed
as the Holiday Armadillo, Joey
dressed in every piece of apparel
Chandler owns and, of course,
"The one with Chandler in a
box." We reminisce about these
episodes when we get together
with friends, striking common
ground with quips such as "I like
Phoebe but my all-time favorite
character has got to be Ross." Yes,
those six famous Manhattan-ites
have filled many a conversation
lull, even after the series finished
in 2004.
But I'm sorry to say that we are
all quietly deceiving ourselves.
"Friends," my friends, consists
of little more than a string of
sex jokes, pointless melodrama
and sloppy writing that leaves us
desiringlittle.
Consider Phoebe (Lisa Kud-
row). She's an orphan who was
supposedly raised on the streets.
Okay, maybe. But we're supposed
to buy that she can speak French
fluently and also believes in Santa
Claus? Something doesn't com-
pute. Though her absurd, wacky
nature has the potential to be
endearing, after a few seasons,
the charm begins to wane. In
fact, Phoebe, who belts out that

The original "Words With Friends."

"Smelly Cat" whenever the writ-
ers need a quick laugh, only has
one redeeming quality: the guest
stars that she brings in, such as
Hank Azaria (as the uber-suave
David) and Paul Rudd (as Mike
- so, basically himself). Her two
potential romantic interests are
not caricatures, nor do they get
caught up in needless plot points
used solely as cheap avenues
for tension. They are, despite
their limited number of episode
appearances, more mature than
basically anyone else on the show.
What makes side charac-
ters such as Rudd and Azaria so
appealing is that their humor
doesn't rely on the easy, recur-
ring one-liners that make up
about 90-percent of each script.
Joey is lovable and sleeps with a
lot of girls, but we love him any-
way; Chandler may or may not be
gay; Ionica used to be fat, and
now she's a neat freak. It's like,

Students only need to take a few courses before given access to the recording studios.

"It was a really great experi-
ence for *me because I started
that project as a student then I
transitioned to staff," Daftuar
said. "It was a really good per-
spective on how the different
roles played together and what
it takes to build studios from
scratch."
The Duderstadt houses two
different electronic music stu-
dios. The first, known as EMS
A, is generally used for smaller
projects such as composition
and mixing to avideo. To accom-
modate these projects, there's a
single 46-inch television cen-
trally placed above tw com-
puter monitors so students can
see what they're doing. While it
is the smallest studio the Dud-
erstadt offers, it's capable of
handling big projects. Like the
other studios in Duderstadt, its
equipment merely has a differ-
ent focus.
"You can do everything else
(in EMS A)," Daftuar said. "You
can certainly do all that other
stuff in here - audio, record
bands, classical, mixing. But
each room has a slightly stron-
ger focus with the way the room
is laid out."
The other studio, EMS B, has
more space, a larger and more
complex console, and two moni-
tors instead of one. It's also the
first studio in the world to house
an 8.0 sound system. Basically,
EMS B is an expansion of EMS
A, but it has, according to Daf-
tuar, "a stronger focus on com-
position as well as sound editing
and mixing." It's also connected
to EMS A, so users can easily use
both rooms' strengths as need-
ed.
"You can use multiple rooms
at the same time," Daftuar said.
"You're able to really branch out.
If your project involves doing
things audio and video in differ-
ent rooms, you can connect the
rooms together."
The rooms were designed
with a lot of flexibility, allowing
users to ferry projects between
rooms and eliminating con-
cerns about space limitation and
bleed-in. With the inclusion of
the newly renovated Audio Stu-

"We offer basically every-
thing you need to do high-qual-

provide you with a whole array
of microphones, cables, adap-
tors, turnarounds, headphones,

Duderstadt offers a few courses
to students.

Before a student sets foot in
a studio, they must go through
a training process. They begin
with DMC 101, a course which
grants access to the multimedia
workrooms and the V-room. Stu-
dents can continue to DMC 201,
which permits students to use
EMS A, then DMC 202, which
certifies them for EMS B, and
finally, DMC 301, which is for
the Audio Studio.

electric catapults (based on
designs by Leonardo da Vinci).
Optional meditation sessions
are held on Mondays, and Rush
gives a lecture to the entire class
every Wednesday. Lectures
cover influential creative think-
ers from history, such as Meister
Eckhart, a German philosopher,
and Lao Tzu, the father of Tao-
ism.
As Rush makes the rounds
from one classroom to the next
and greets students from each
separate cohort, he describes
the class with a combination of
idealism and serious fortitude.
He unabashedly states that the
class's airy is nothing less than
social transformation. By bring-
ing people together from dis-
tinct parts of the University and
studying a curriculum as diverse
and broad as creativity itself,
Rush believes this type of course
can foster an acceptance that
can have a profound impact on
the world at large.
"This is when the Gaza Strip
gets solved," he said. "This is
when the Berlin Wall goes down,
is when people can cut through
'the walls of differentiation and
pull people together. Now, you
can have 100,000 classes on
diversity training that try to do
exactly the same process, but the
fact is we're actually doing it, but
we never even talk about it."
Outside of a room in the base-
ment of Bursley Residence Hall
- which functions as the medi-
tation room, lecture hall and
movement classroom - Rush
watches the movement class
currently in session. He marvels
at the way students who have
never danced before they start-
ed the course allow themselves
.to take chances, to fall down,
to risk failure and to help each
other out.
"We talk about (failure) a lot
in this class," Rush said. "Noth-
ing turns out the way you think
it's going to turn out ... things
surprise you. And the thing is to
delight in what's happening in

the process and not get all mad
at it, and go 'oh, you bad thing
that I'm creating.'"
He added: "Fear is always the
enemy of creativity."
A crowd of students begins to
gather for the lecture, and Rush
speaks with them as one would
to a friend, as equals. Despite the
class's large size, students and
teachers get to know one anoth-
er on a personal basis, which
Rush maintains is an important
draw for students.
"All the professors are going*
to learn your name. They're
going to know what you're
about, what your final prompt is,
so it's a kind of ecosystem where
you're valued," he said. "And,
look, that's where you want to
hang, right? You want to hang
with people that know who you
are and what you're about."
The students and Rush file
into the makeshift lecture hail
where tables, couches, pool
tables and floor space are all
used as spots for note-taking.
The scene could easily be mis-
taken for dorm residents relax-
ing in the student lounge, except
that at the front of the room,
Rush begins to lecture on Buck-
minster Fuller and the invention
of the geodesic dome. _
Tingshen Chen, a sophomore
in the School of Engineering,
hangs back to speak about his
thoughts on "Creative Process."
For Chen, the class is more a

journey of self-discovery than
it is a way to literally create
things.
"Other departments teach
you how you can think outside
the box and how you can be cre-
ative," he said. "But this (class) is
more about being a human and
being yourself. It's like living life
to the fullest can help you come
to these great thoughts."
Chen takes a seat in the class
next to his peers. Amy Chavasse,
an associate professor of Dance
and the instructor for the move-
ment section, exits the class-
room upon finishingteachingfor
the day. She too places emphasis
on the value of interdisciplinary
classes. Yet she acknowledges
that there will always be tension
between those who value the
pure technique and those who
desire to understand a broad
spectrum of ideas.
But the opportunity to share
her area of expertise in a forum
devoted to pushing boundaries
of what is possible, emotionally
and physically, outweighs any
tension that might arise.
"In this class I just had, there
were a couple of Ph.D. engineer-
ing people in there, and they're
like flying all over, flinging them-
selves all over the room, just
being totally uninhibited .. it's
really amazing," said Cavasse.
"(This class) is an opportunity
to be playful in the most serious

FRIENDS
From Page 3B
It was an episode from the 5th
season, the one in which Rachel
buys an obscenely expensive and
ugly cat, Phoebe breaks up with
Gary, and Ross and Joey invent a
new game ... called catch.
"Friends" certainly wasn't
without its flaws, and even some
of the most diehard fans are
quick to admit its slumps: par-
ticularly, its final season, when
the show felt more like a slightly
funny soap opera than a slightly
soapy sitcom. And nowadays,
when a show premieres, set in a
big city and featuring a group of
beautiful hipster pals who are all
single, penniless yet somehow
still able to afford spacious, high-
ceilinged apartments, we roll
our eyes. "Oh, it's just another
'Friends' wannabe."
"Friends" became the standard
for the friends-in-the-big-city sit-
com, not because they did it first
("Seinfeld" beat it by about four
years), but because the show did it
best. And the six main reasons it

succeeded were its six main char-
acters. The writers didn't simply
rely on established sitcom gags;
most of the jokes and setups were
character-based and character-
specific, employing truly deft
comedy writing that played to the
quirks of each character.
And the cast members, though
equally talented, each had their
own strengths that allowed them
to play off of each other and form
a charismatic, polished ensemble:
Jennifer Aniston played Rachel
with a charming softness; David
Schwimmer made Ross a lovable,
heavy-hearted dork; Courteney
Cox brought moments of sincer-
ity and severity to Monica; Mat-
thew Perry never failed to nail his
delivery of Chandler's sardoni-
cisms (honestly, could Chandler
be any more hilarious?); Matt
LeBlanc similarly brought show-
stealing delivery to dim-witted
Joey's exchanges; Lisa Kudrow
managed to make Phoebe more
than just a caricature despite her
over-the-top eccentricities.
But the characters weren't
the only reason "Friends" has
achieved legendary status

amongst TV critics and viewers
alike, "Friends" was inherently
a '90s show, with its lip-liner-
adorned ladies, bright colors and
denim,butoutside of the outdated
pop-culture references and taboo
fashion choices, the show and its
themes -- sex, love, careers and, of
course, friendship - are timeless.
There's a reason why our
generation still laughs hysteri-
callyat the gang's shenanigans,
whether it's when Ross likens
choosing between sex and dino-
saurs to "Sophie's Choice" or
anytime Phoebe picks up her
guitar (everyone knows "Smelly
Cat," but let's not forget classics
like "Dumb, Drunken Bitch" and
"Goats are Parading"). "Friends"
is a snapshot of a generation, but
it transcends its time. Just like
I haven't forgotten the night of
the admittedly underwhelm-
ing series finale, when my mom,
grandma and I gathered in our
family room to tune in with
over 50 million other viewers,
"Friends" has left its mark on
television and will likely not be
forgotten.
