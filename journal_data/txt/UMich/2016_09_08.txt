The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
kicked off one of its weekly 
voter 
registration 
drives 

Wednesday 
with 
a 
special 

appearance from actor Sean 
Astin, best known for his role 
as Sam in Lord of the Rings.

Astin spoke to students and 

community 
members 
about 

campaigning at ground-level 
events. 
He 
also 
discussed 

his experiences with Hillary 
Clinton who he’s known since 
1992, calling her one of the most 
passionate and hardworking 
people he has ever met.

The 
event, 
held 
in 
the 

Michigan 
Union, 
was 

coordinated 
in 
conjunction 

with 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

campaign in Michigan.

Voter registration is one of 

several major outreach efforts 
coordinated by the University’s 
College Democrats during an 
election year. This year they 
plan to hold voter registration 
drives every week until Oct. 11, 
the last day to register voters in 
time for the November election.

Collin 
Kelly, 
chair 
of 

College Democrats, said the 
group is holding registration 
drives to promote Democratic 
candidates on both local and 
state levels, along with Clinton.

During the event, Astin 

said he came to campus to 
encourage 
volunteers 
at 

the grassroots level of the 

campaign and remind them of 
their significance.

“Those 
kinds 
of 
people 

need to know that they are not 
operating in a vacuum,” he said. 
“That they have the support 
of millions and millions of 
Americans who rely on them 
to do that footwork … It’s 
endlessly inspiring to see the 
optimism of students when it 
comes to engagement and being 
involved in their civic life.”

The 
organization 
and 

coordination 
of 
celebrity 

events such as this is done by 
the Clinton campaign itself, 
not College Democrats, but the 
campaign works to coordinate 
with student groups in the later 
stages of the process, Kelly 
said.

Kelly 
said 
having 

celebrities 
like 
Astin 
visit 

campus encourages a level of 
excitement 
among 
student 

in this election cycle and 
compliments the more local 
figures that typically come to 
campus.

“When you have people who 

are really respected and well-
known to come voice their 
opinion allows students to 
follow their lead and for that 
enthusiasm to really catch on,” 
he said.

For both Clinton and GOP 

Over 
the 
summer, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

expanded its academic offering 
in an unusual aread — one that 
doesn’t involve sitting in an 
actual classroom.

The University has added 

two new course specializations 
to Coursera, an online company 
which offers Massive Open 
Online Courses to learners 
seeking education in a certain 
field 
from 
an 
established 

university.

Course specializations are 

a sequence of several courses 
that fall under a certain subject. 
The two new specializations 
the University is offering are 
Applied Data Science with 
Python and Data Collection 
and 
Analysis. 
Once 
these 

specializations are completed, 
students receive an electronic 
certificate of completion.

In an email interview, James 

DeVaney, associate vice provost 
for 
academic 
innovation, 

wrote 
these 
specializations 

were approved by a faculty 
committee that works closely

The 
Federal 
Rail 

Administration 
and 
city 

government 
are 
moving 

forward with plans to build 
Amtrak 
stations 
at 
four 

potential sites in Ann Arbor, 
each with varying support from 
City Council members.

The next step in the planning 

process 
is 
completing 
an 

environmental 
assessment 

report within the next two 
months, 
according 
to 
Eli 

Cooper, transportation program 
manager for Ann Arbor.

Cooper said the city has 

sub-contracted environmental 

specialists and engineers at 
the technology firm AECOM 
to gather environmental data, 
and he expects a draft of the 
assessment to be underway in 
October. 

Two of the four possible 

station designs are both at the 
location of the current Amtrak 
station on Depot Street. One 
of the design options is for an 
elevated station. The other is 
for a ground level station north 
of the tracks.

The third possible station 

design, also located on Depot 
Street, would replace the Gandy 
Dancer restaurant, repurposing 
the building as a train station

Rob Sellers, vice provost for equity, inclusion and academic affairs, encourage successful college practices at the SuccessConnects Orientation in the Student 
Activities Building Wednesday.

The SuccessConnects program 

held its orientation for its over 
150 student scholars Wednesday 
in the Student Activites Building.

SuccessConnects is a program 

guided by the Office of Academic 
Multicultural 
Initiatives 
that 

works with underrepresented 
freshman students to help them 
sort their way through the pool 
of resources available to them, 
as well as the academic and 
social challenges the University 
of Michigan could potentially 

pose for them. It primarily 
seeks to serve first-generation 
college 
students, 
low-income 

students 
and 
students 
from 

underrepresented minorities.

Mary Taylor, a Success Coach 

and 
program 
coordinator 
at 

OAMI, said her team aims to 
create a community for students 

who may feel lost on a big campus.

“We 
are 
trying 
to 
serve 

students who wouldn’t get served 
by other programs,” she said. 
“We are bringing the resources 
to them and trying to make 
Michigan feel much smaller.”

FIRST REAL LECTURES.

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

highlighted the importance of 
free speech and open discourse 
that 
respects 
all 
viewpoints 

in a statement to the campus 
community Wednesday.

 “The conflict of discordant 

ideas and opinions — even when 
it makes us uncomfortable — is an 
essential feature of an academic 
community,” Schlissel said.

 He also emphasized that 

when challenging ideas, students 
should treat each other with 
respect and equality, and that 
hate speech or threats diminish 
learning by inhibiting discussion.

 Schlissel’s statement comes 

two weeks after a controversial 
letter written by Jay Ellison, dean 
of students at the University of 
Chicago, to incoming students 
which articulated a policy not to 
support teacher-issued “trigger 

warnings.”

 
Trigger 
warnings 
are 

statements provided before a text, 
performance or event that alert 
viewers to potentially distressing 
material.

 Like the University of Chicago 

letter, 
Schlissel’s 
statement 

emphasized the importance of 
being intellectually challenged 
by different opinions as a key 
tenant of a college education. 

He said disagreement among 
diverse perspectives is often 
inevitable, 
but 
allows 
for 

problem solving and positive 
change. 
Schlissel 
did 
not 

specifically mention trigger 
warnings.

 He has taken similar 

positions on the issue of 
campus free speech in the 
past, especially in response 
to incidents around the issue. 
Last April, Schlissel authored 
an essay which was published 
on the Huffington Post in 
response to the anti-Islamic 
messages written on the UM 
Diag, which warned against 
visceral aversion to conflicting 
opinions.

 “It is pointless — perhaps 

hypocritical — to extoll the 
virtues of the marketplace of 
ideas if some members of our 
community feel excluded from 
it,” Schlissel wrote in April. “It 
is contradictory to celebrate 
the power of words but deny 
their capacity to wound and 
marginalize.”

 Despite arguing that the

The Michigan Senate introduced 

and voted Wednesday on the passage 
of a bill that will allow dogs in outdoor 
restaurants and patios. However, for cat 
lovers, felines are not included in the 
new legislation and must be left at home.

State 
Senator 
Margaret 
O’Brien 

(R-Portage) is sponsoring the bill. 
O’Brien said she decided to draft this 
bill following many requests from 
restaurant owners hoping to make their 
establishments pet-friendly.

Current Michigan law only permits 

service or seeing-eye dogs in restaurants. 
If passed, Senate Bill 727 would allow 
dogs to the outside areas of restaurants, 
though wouldn’t permit them inside. The 
legislation would require restaurants to 
keep a designated outdoor area where 
dogs are not allowed — thereby avoiding 
the issues of hair and bodily waste.

Ishani Mathur, an LSA sophomore 

and dog owner, said she believes the bill 
will have a positive impact on restaurant 
environments.

“I really think it’s a great idea,” she 

said according to the Detroit Free Press. 
“I feel like a lot of times dogs are such 

a huge part of what we do as society. I 
think it really makes the atmosphere so 
much better.”

The bill gives businesses the freedom 

to prohibit dogs on their patios if they so 
chose. It also makes dog owners liable 
for any injuries or damages their pets 
may make at the restaurant.

The bill will now go to the House 

where it will either be rejected or voted 
into law.

At downtown Ann Arbor restaurant 

The Blue Tractor, manager Brett Oliver 
said the restaurant has always been 
welcoming to dogs.

“We welcome it. We’ve always 

welcomed it. We will even bring out 
bowls of water for the dogs,” he said. “I 
think (the bill) just makes it an actual 
thing, but people have being doing it 
since I’ve been here.”

Courtney Oliver, manager of Mani 

Osteria on Liberty St., repeated this 
sentiment, saying her establishment 
already allows dogs to be seated with 
customers in patios areas, so this 
legislation would not change anything 
for the restaurant.

for the first time in decades. The 
Gandy Dancer was the location 
of the original station, before 
the restaurant existed. The 
fourth potential location for the 
new station is the city-owned 
surface parking lot in Fuller 
Park.

Councilmembers Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) and Jack Eaton (D–
Ward 4) have both expressed 
opposition to building the new 
station in Fuller Park because 
it’s 
technically 
park 
land, 

despite hosting a parking lot 
for the University of Michigan 
Health Systems.

Eaton said he’d like to see the 

Gandy Dancer repurposed as 
a station due to the building’s 
beauty.

“The Gandy Dancer is a much 

nicer building and it would great 
if we could use that, I just don’t 
know what the likelihood of that 
is,” Eaton said.

While many people believe 

Amtrak is used as a commuter 
train for University employees, 
it’s used mostly by travelers, 
Briere said. Thus, the Fuller 
location, though close to the 
University hospital, may not be 
useful for those who use Amtrak 
the most.

“Looking at U of M’s employee 

base — where their zip codes 
are — they are not concentrated 
in the east and they are not 
concentrated in Jackson, to 
the west,” Briere said. “So, the 
likelihood that this will meet 
commuter needs may not be as 
high as some anticipate.”

A community organization, 

Protect A2 Parks, has also 
mobilized against the Fuller 
location, 
asking 
citizens 
to 

contact 
their 
local 
council 

member urging them to push an 
Amtrak station there.

“If park land is used for 

transportation 
purposes, 

the 
decision 
makers 
must 

demonstrate that there is no 
‘prudent or feasible alternative 
location,’ ” the website reads. 
“We believe that the Depot 
Street location is both prudent 
and feasible, and that its use 
will provide the best benefit to 
the community.”

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3) said he 
believes that the Federal Rail 
Association 
will 
recommend 

the station which is the best 
option for the community and 
commuters and did not express 
a preference.

Cooper and Ackerman also 

both said they believe the most 
important thing is that the 
project continues progressing.

“This is a time of a lot of 

momentum 
for 
a 
possible 

commuter rail to Detroit but 
also investments from Amtrak 
in the next 15 years for high-
speed rails from Detroit to 
Chicago, with Ann Arbor being 
a critical stop along the way.” 
Ackerman said. “We are already 
the busiest Amtrak station in 
the state and I think we need to 
be a leader as we move forward.”

senior 
Callie 
Munn, 
an 

Academic 
Success 
Partner 

at SuccessConnects, said the 
program offers a variety of 
opportunities for these students 
to find their community within 
the larger University setting, 
ultimately 
aiming 
to 
aid 

students in their transition to 
college.

“We cover (in the program) 

academic 
wellness, 
physical 

wellness, mental wellness and 
financial wellness,” she said. 
“We provide the students with a 
home away from home.”

On Wednesday, following a 

light reception where students 
had the opportunity to meet 
each other and the staff of 
SuccessConnects, 
there 
was 

an informational presentation 
about the program. It featured 
speakers 
including 
Robert 

Sellers, the vice provost for 
Equity, Inclusion and Academic 
Affairs.

During his speech, Sellers 

spoke about the advantages 
of coming from a diverse 
background.

“What 
makes 
Michigan 

great?” he asked the audience. 

“From 
my 
perspective, 
it’s 

what we define as diversity. If 
you have more perspectives 
surrounding a problem, you’re 
more likely to get more creative 
and successful solutions.”

Sellers 
also 
emphasized 

the normality of struggling 
in 
college 
and 
encouraged 

students to form a strong 
community to help cope with 
the stresses and transitions of 
college life.

“Everyone 
struggles,” 
he 

said. “It’s important that you 
don’t struggle by yourself. The 
people that are successful do 
not struggle by themselves.”

Hector Galvan, University 

alum 
and 
current 
Success 

Coach, said he thinks the 
variety of resources available 
to the SuccessConnects student 
scholars 
are 
valuable 
and 

should be utilized throughout 
their time at the University.

“There a lot of resources 

here focused specifically on 
developing you as a student,” 
he said. “We are here to help 
you explore those resources on 
campus to take you to where 
you want to be.”

Gloria Taylor, director of 

the Office of Multicultural 
Academic Initiatives, said the 
SuccessConnects 
orientation 

and 
program 
are 
part 
of 

her office’s commitment to 
the University’s mission of 
diversity, equity and inclusion.

“The arm that we represent 

is diversity and inclusion,” she 
said. “We do programs that 
provide a more comfortable 
space for students.”

Program manager Sharon 

Burch said the key to the 
program is their belief in the 
capabilities of their student 
scholars, and their overarching 
goal to help students recognize 
a higher level of success beyond 
the average student.

“We know that they’re going 

to 
be 
successful 
anyway,” 

she said. “A higher level of 
achievement is what we are 
hoping that these students take 
away from this.”

In 
his 
closing 
remarks, 

Sellers offered the students in 
the audience a piece of advice 
encompassing 
the 
goals 
of 

SuccessConnects, saying would 
change their lives for the better.

“Always do your very best at 

whatever it is you’re doing at 
that particular time, given all 
the things that you are facing,” 
he said. “Do no more, but do 
no less. If you live by that, then 
you will be in control of your 
happiness.”

courses were selected for 
many reasons as they create 
new 
pathways 
for 
global 

learners to connect to the 
U-M community and level 
up as data scientists; align 
with institutional priorities 
around academic excellence 
and diversity, equity, and 
inclusion; and seek to address 
important questions around 
opportunities in residential 
and 
hybrid 
learning,” 

DeVaney wrote.

The University has been 

partnered 
with 
Coursera 

since 2013 and edX, another 
online 
course 
company, 

since 2015. Combined, the 
University has created more 
than 90 MOOCs with nearly 5 
million enrollments.

DeVaney 
wrote 
that 

the 
students 
enrolled 

in 
these 
classes 
are 

typically 
prospective 

Michigan students, current 
undergraduate and graduate 
students as well as alumni 
and learners from more than 
200 countries around the 
world. The instructors do 
not receive class rosters for 
MOOCs like they would for 
an in-person college course 
so they do not know exactly 
who their students are.

Jim Lepkowski, a research 

professor at the Institute 
for Social Research, is part 
of the team that created 
the 
Data 
Collection 
and 

Analysis Specialization — a 
specialization the University 
shares with the University of 
Maryland.

Lepkowski, who is part 

of a group that has worked 
in Survey and Methodology 
for more than two decades, 
said the impetus for the 
specialization 
came 
from 

a 
course 
hosted 
by 
the 

University of Michigan and 
the University of Maryland. 
Parts of the course are filmed 
at Michigan and parts are 
filmed 
at 
Maryland, 
but 

students at both universities 
experience the class live. 
After 
several 
years 
of 

experimenting with a flipped 
classroom 
experience, 
the 

team realized they wanted 
to do more of this kind of 
teaching 
and 
contacted 

Coursera 
about 
creating 

a course on how to write 
questions for surveys.

Lepkowski said the course 

was surprisingly successful, 
and the team wanted to do 
more to teach about the 
science behind surveys.

“We began to view (the 

success of the first course) as 
an opportunity to spread the 
word about surveys, survey 
research 
and 
the 
science 

behind it,” Lepkowski said. 
“Not just anybody can do 
a survey but if you really 
want to do it well, here are 
the basic principles that you 
could use to write questions 
or to select a sample or to 
collect the data.”

It was then that Coursera 

contacted 
them 
about 

specializations 
and 
they 

decided to create the Data 
Collection 
and 
Analysis 

specialization. 
There 

are six courses and one 
capstone project under this 
specialization. While some 
of these courses have not yet 
been finished or released, 
there 
are 
already 
3,000 

people enrolled.

Each 
course 
in 
the 

specialization 
consists 
of 

units which have exercises 
that include multiple-choice 
questions 
for 
students 
to 

answer, trying until they 
are 
correct, 
as 
well 
as 

open-ended 
short 
answer 

questions. For open-ended 
questions, students have the 
chance for their work to be 

peer evaluated. Each unit also 
has a discussion board where 
students can post questions 
about 
the 
exercises 
and 

lectures.

Lepkowski said Coursera 

allows instructors to monitor 
how students learn and see 
their progression throughout 
the course.

“There are numbers we can 

see about how many students 
are doing what,” Lepkowski 
said. 
“We 
can 
see 
what 

questions they’re struggling 
with, when they’ve made 
multiple attempts to answer 
correctly and we can see their 
responses to questions on the 
discussion boards and see 
what their writing is like.”

Christopher 
Brooks, 
a 

professor in the School of 
Information, is part of the 
team that created Applied 
Data Science with Python. 
He said after creating some 
courses with Coursera, he 
approached some faculty and 
his dean about creating the 
specialization 
around 
last 

December.

Brooks 
created 
the 

first two courses for the 
specialization. 
Before 
the 

first course is released on 
Sept. 26, Brooks said there 
will be a beta test that a group 
of University students will 
take to see which parts of the 
course they like and which 
parts 
need 
improvement. 

Following the first release, a 
new course will be released 
each month.

Brooks said MOOCs are 

beneficial to students because 
they can learn at a time and 
place of their choosing.

“It’s anytime, anywhere 

learning 
so 
students 
can 

watch in their dorm room, 
watch it on the bus, watch it 
at midnight in their pajamas. 
They can also skip parts that 
they know already,” Brooks 
said.

Another benefit of taking 

MOOCs, 
Lepkowski 
said, 

is 
that 
there 
are 
more 

opportunities to see where 
students are struggling and 
to make connections between 
the material and difficult 
areas, which can be harder 
to do in a physical classroom 
settings.

“Sometimes in the courses 

that you take you don’t get 
much of a sense of how it 
all 
fits 
together 
between 

courses,” Lepkowski said. “I 
think Coursera helps in being 
able to see the broader picture 
of what this is all about.”

Lepkowski 
said 
though 

there are a lot of opportunities 
to 
interact 
with 
other 

students and the instructor 
on Coursera, he does not 
think it compares to a regular 
classroom experience where 
students 
are 
face-to-face 

with an instructor.

Because there is no face-to-

face interaction or a degree 
attached to MOOCs, students 
taking these courses must 
use their own motivation 
to 
complete 
the 
course. 

However, Brooks said this 
aspect of MOOCs has helped 
expand his teaching, and that 
the diversity of students who 
enroll in MOOCs has caused 
him to be more inclusive in 
his teaching. 

“One of the big (benefits of 

MOOCs) is it helps us think 
about 
students 
differently 

because we think about a 
broader array of students, a 
more diverse population than 
we’re teaching,” Brooks said.

The University hopes to 

continue 
its 
partnerships 

with Coursera and edX as part 
of its commitment academic 
innovation, DeVaney wrote.

DeVaney also noted that 

the data they receive from 
MOOCs will change the way 
the 
University 
approaches 

education.

“We look closely at data 

from each of our courses, and 
across this growing portfolio 
of courses, to inform the way 
we design, deliver and assess 
learning 
on 
campus 
and 

beyond,” DeVaney said.

contender 
Donald 
Trump, 

the youth vote will be both 
important, and historically, hard 
to get. Young people historically 
and consistently have the lowest 
voter turnout of any age group.

Students 
supported 
Sen. 

Bernie 
Sanders 
(I–Vt.) 
over 

Clinton 
during 
the 
primary 

election earlier this year, helping 
push him to a narrow upset 
victory, though many students 
told The Michigan Daily they 
voted 
for 
other 
candidates. 

Young people also filled the 
streets of Philadelphia during the 
Democratic National Convention 
in July voicing opposition to 
Clinton’s nomination. Protesters 
argued the candidate unfairly 
won the nomination due to 
the 
DNC’s 
favor 
towards 

Clinton, citing emails leaked by 
WikiLeaks.

Public Policy Lecturer Rusty 

Hill told the Daily in July he 
believes few students would vote 
for Donald Trump over Clinton, 
but the turnout of students will 
be key for a democratic victory.

“Obviously 
the 
more 

depressed the youth vote is, the 
better Trump will do in the state 
of Michigan,” Hill said.

the span of four years. Toyota 
is also a founding partner 
of the University’s Mobility 
Transformation Center, which 
operates MCity.

Two 
University 
faculty 

members — Ryan Eustice, 
associate professor of Naval 
Architecture 
and 
Marine 

Engineering, 
and 
Edwin 

Olson, associate professor of 
Electrical 
Engineering 
and 

Computer Science — were 
hired by TRI to collaborate 
on the new research. Both 
professors will maintain part-
time faculty positions at the 
University during the course 
of their research with TRI.

In 
the 
announcement, 

Gill 
Pratt, 
CEO 
of 
the 

Toyota 
Research 
Institute, 

emphasized 
Toyota’s 

continued relationship with 
the University.

“Toyota has long enjoyed an 

excellent working relationship 
with 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, and we are excited 
to 
expand 
our 
collective 

efforts to address complex 
mobility challenges through 
artificial intelligence,” he said.

Olson, 
who, 
along 
with 

Eustice, 
is 
a 
co-director 

of 
autonomous 
driving 

development 
at 
the 
TRI 

facility, said their role is to 
help coordinate the technical 
approaches 
that 
research 

teams working at the TRI 
facility 
take 
to 
address 

aspects of autonomous vehicle 
technology including machine 
perception, 
mapping 
and 

human interfaces.

“As co-directors, we are 

able to help ‘steer the ship’ in 
terms of the approaches used 
to solve these problems, and 

critically, to make sure that 
the sub-teams’ work all fits 
together,” he said.

There are a wide range of 

technical disciplines and skills 
required to complete the full 
picture of autonomous driving, 
according 
to 
Olson, 
and 

simultaneously 
approaching 

all angles and sewing them 
together is very challenging. 
He said he thinks Toyota is 
interested in working with 
the University for this reason, 
in the same way it works with 
Stanford and MIT, to make 
use of the expertise and talent 
present at the institutions.

“The problems that we are 

working to solve are the best 
kind: really hard,” he said. 
“Fundamental 
research 
is 

needed to solve these problems 
and so TRI is investing in 
both internal research and 
university partnerships like 
the one at UM.”

removal of anti-Islam chalk 
messages written on the Diag 
was not a form of censorship, 
Schlissel did challenge readers 
to be open to all opinions, 
if 
stated 
respectfully. 
Some 

students said these chalkings 
were microaggressions against 
Muslim students.

Over the past few years? The 

University has adopted several 
institutional 
changes 
around 

concerns of micro-aggressions 
and triggers in the classroom and 
around campus.

During a Leadership Breakfast 

in February, Schlissel announced 
a new professional development 
program in response to findings 
in a report from the Provost’s 
Committee on Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion that aim to make 
classrooms 
more 
inclusive 

spaces.

“We will be implementing 

professional 
development 

programs to help new faculty to 

be more effective teachers for all 
of our students.” Schlissel said. 
“This means providing skills 
to address and prevent micro-
aggressions in the classroom as 
well as strategies for effectively 
calling upon diverse perspectives 

in the classroom to achieve our 
learning goals.”.

This initiative, and others like 

it, all come from the University 
led “Expect Respect” campaign, 
which aims to brings awareness 
to the impacts of hateful speech.

y adolescent years were weaned on 
Tumblr, a website that stole too much 
of my middle school free time and 

taught me words and phrases such as “queer,” 
“neurotypical” and “social justice warrior.” These 
were the days before celebrities such as Halsey 
and Zendaya took social justice from the hid-
den corners of the Internet and made it trend on 
Twitter. Back in middle school, there was no Amy 
Schumer to tell me I could love my body even 
though stretch marks painted my thighs, no John 
Legend to explain to me that #BlackLivesMatter 
doesn’t mean that other lives don’t matter, just 
that Black lives matter, too. No, social justice and 
political correctness were self-taught classes back 
in middle school, and I was the star student in my 
class of one.

Yet, as the world began waking up and social 

issues found themselves on the front cover of 
renowned magazines and newspapers, it seemed 
the people immediately around me were still fast 
asleep, Sleeping Beauties stuck in a past era. Din-
ner table conversations were hopelessly lopsided 
as I struggled to educate my family on topics they 
just couldn’t understand. There was no malice 
in my friends’ voices when they expressed shock 
about a fellow classmate’s change in pronouns or 
their fabulous fuchsia dress at prom, just confu-

sion. “I just … don’t get it,” my friend said once, 
upon learning that Laverne Cox was transgender. 
“How can you just feel like a different gender? Isn’t 
that just being, like, a tomboy? What’s the differ-
ence between being a tomboy and a transsexual?” 
“Transgender,” I corrected gently.

Teaching my friends and family to think oth-

erwise was a challenge. After all, they’d grown up 
in conservative homes in a perfect cookie-cutter 
Midwestern town: Troy, Mich. Cis and trans were 
chemistry terms, and gender was as binary as a 
base-two number system. I’d learned in Troy that 
it was easier to stay quiet and “stick to the status 
quo.” Online, I could safely rock the boat and dis-
cuss police brutality, but in real life, it was easier 
to just nod with a tight smile when my co-worker 
condemned abortion and “homosexuals in the 
government.” I was waiting for my community to 
catch up to the social activism on the internet, but 
it just seemed hopelessly stuck.

Stepping foot onto the University of Michigan’s 

campus during Summer Orientation was like 
Tumblr coming to life around me. As my orienta-
tion leaders introduced themselves by their names, 
majors and preferred pronouns, my jaw dropped 
to the ground. I’d never heard anyone state their 
preferred pronouns in person before. This min-
ute detail made all the difference in welcoming 
anyone who may not identify as male or female 
with open arms. The Educational Theater Com-
pany performance only reinforced the culture of 
inclusion and diversity as the players danced and 
sang about topics I’d always considered “taboo” 
in real life: mental illness, gender roles, racism, 
sexism and feminism. Awestruck in the dark 
auditorium, I realized that staying quiet wouldn’t 
inspire change in the community around me. I 
couldn’t just wait around for my family and peers 
to “catch up;” change needs a catalyst, and a voice 
is the first spark.

Emboldened by the spirit of activism on the 

University of Michigan’s campus, I returned 
home a bolder woman. The change was small, 
but it was a flicker where previously there was 
none. When my co-worker denounced abortion, 
I replied to him, offering many reasons women 
choose to abort and control their own bodies. I 
may not have changed his mind, but I offered him 
the perspective of a woman in the pro-life debate, 
a necessary viewpoint which he lacked. When 
my mother fretted over the length of my skirt 
before I left to hang out at a boy’s house, I ques-
tioned why promiscuity by females is so condem-
nable but promiscuity by males is celebrated. And 
when my well-meaning friend called a celebrity 
“weird” because “she tweets stuff like ‘hashtag 
feminism,’ ” I, with the help of another friend, 
explained to her that feminists aren’t all angry, 
man-hating monsters.

These steps are little, but they are the result of 

a single weekend on campus. I can only imagine 
how much more I’ll learn after one year, and then 
four years. “College makes students liberal,” my 
government teacher had stated as if it were some-
thing terrible, but I don’t think college pushes 
students one way or the other. Rather, college 
students are allowed, for the first time, to experi-
ence social issues unfolding right in front of them. 
On a college campus, students can form their 
own opinions and views without the overhang-
ing influence of family, and they are wowed to see 
that they, too, can inspire change.

T

he city of Detroit has long been a great 
American city that has gone through a 
lot as our nation has developed. Over 

the past few years, Detroit 
has had its fair share of 
struggles, having filed for 
bankruptcy in 2013 and 
seen a monumental decline 
in population over the last 
few decades. Pundits and writers from as close 
as Michigan and as far away as other countries 
are always lining up to take shots at Detroit and 
its identity as a city.

However, the problems with Detroit didn’t 

start in the last 10 years. Decades of systemic 
racism and inequality have allowed privileged 
white people to move to suburbs as far away as 
Ann Arbor, while stranding low-income minority 
populations inside the city with less and less 
resources available to serve the city.

Even this last year, Detroit Public Schools 

were reborn as the Detroit Community Schools 
as part of a deal worked out in the Michigan 
legislature — a deal that I have already spoken 
out against. Despite the fact that Detroit is 
the largest city in Michigan, enrollment at 
the University of Michigan features a sparse 
population of Detroit residents.

To add onto all of this, Republican presidential 

candidate Donald Trump still found a way to 
call Michigan, specifically the manufacturing 
sector of Detroit, a “disaster.” Michigan students 
frequently have a litany of bad things to say about 

the city. Even students who have never been to 
Michigan ask if they are safe to visit the airport, 
which is located 20 minutes outside of Detroit 
city limits.

Despite all of this, I still have hope. Detroit 

is an amazingly diverse city, with pockets of 
areas made up of a majority of Muslim or Latino 
people. The culture and spirit of Detroit can’t be 
crushed, and I firmly believe that things will only 
go upward from here. All across the city, people 
are coming together to do what the city motto has 
instructed the city to do for hundreds of years. 
“Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus,” the 
Latin mottos on the city flag, say we shall hope 
for better things, and that those things shall rise 
from the ashes. 

That motto is something I can believe — not 

for a “new Detroit” only for wealthy suburban 
residents or downtown trustafarians, but 
for a Detroit that rises from the ashes for all 
Detroiters. I highly urge all Michigan students 
to visit Detroit via the free Detroit Center 
Connector and to explore all that the great 
things the city has to offer.

Finally, I urge everyone to keep abreast on 

issues in the city. While it may be easy to ignore 
developments about the ongoing school concerns 
or the unfair tax foreclosures that are taking 
place across the city, it is incredibly important to 
stay up to date on what is happening.

Just 40 minutes away

M

y sister is sitting straight 
up on the end of our 
living room couch, her 

eyes 
refus-

ing 
to 
waver 

from our large 
flat-screen 
TV. She’s been 
binge-watching 
“House of Cards” for nearly four 
hours now, and in this particular 
episode, President Underwood is 
threatening his own wife in the 
most overdramatic, Machiavellian 
manner I have ever witnessed. My 
sister is hanging on the fictional 
president’s every word in pure awe 
of what she believes is a dramatical-
ly accurate picture of the dark side 
of American politics. Meanwhile, 
I sit there in utter disgust at the 
almost insane depiction of Ameri-
can politics. I hate political dramas.

In total truth, I have seen nearly 

every major political drama put to 
TV, Netflix and HBO. Being high-
ly interested in politics naturally 
leads me to watching a fictional-
ized version of my obsession. Yet 
the current political climate has 
brought me to begin to despise 
these shows.

Americans distrust our govern-

ment, and our current election 
cycle clearly shows that. Candidates 
on both sides of the aisle have vowed 
to work against the establishment 
and the typical government bureau-
cracy that they say has failed the 
American people. To add to this 
distrust, the public also lacks a basic 
understanding of the functions and 
responsibilities of our government. 
For example, the Annenberg Public 
Policy Center reported that a little 
more than a third of Americans 
could name all three branches of 
the U.S. government. This funda-
mental lack of understanding of our 
complex government, paired with 
a growing distrust of politicians, 
leaves us in today’s chaotic presi-
dential election.

The public’s “imagination” of 

what politicians do within the 
upper echelons of government 
can be somewhat attributed to 
the emergence of American politi-
cal dramas. Shows like “The West 
Wing,” “Scandal” and “House of 
Cards” are truly terrible guides to 
the way our government operates 
and how our politicians work. Yet 
these shows are extraordinarily 
entertaining and addictive. They 
carry massive audiences through 
multiple seasons, winning awards, 
securing excellent ratings, all at 
the expense of shaping false mis-
conceptions of the politicians of 
our country. The shows person-
ify politics to a crippling degree, 
oversimplify the policy making 
of our massive bureaucracy, and 
most importantly, cast politicians 
as these scheming sociopaths who 
manipulate and warp the system 
for their own benefit. These fac-
tors culminate to a false representa-
tion of our government within the 
minds of millions of Americans, and 
as the current election cycle shows, 

unorthodox candidates can capital-
ize on this ignorance.

America got its first taste of 

political drama in 1999 with the 
NBC series “The West Wing.” 
Though 
the 
show 
was 
well 

received 
from 
an 
entertain-

ment standpoint, many of the 
more politically informed view-
ers were disappointed with its 
“personality-driven politics,” to 
quote an article from The Atlan-
tic. It portrayed a false image of 
what happens within the levels of 
bureaucracy in our government. 
Individual characters tackled mas-
sive responsibilities and challeng-
es that have been unsolvable for 
decades. For example, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict is solved in a 
matter of a few episodes, prompt-
ing this idea that major conflicts 
can be solved through some per-
sonal “heart to heart” negotiation 
and compromising policy between 
understanding individuals.

But who could blame NBC? “The 

West Wing” was only entertaining 
when the cast was able to solve 
the unsolvable through their hard 
work and dedication. What audi-

ence wants to watch an Israeli-
Palestinian compromise descend 
into failure? Or see a debate over 
what entitlements to cut for poor-
er Americans? Or listen to presi-
dential candidates speak about 
banning entire religions or how 
much the United States will tor-
ture its military prisoners? Well 
unfortunately, that is the reality, 
and these dramas only add to mak-
ing that reality worse in the fact 
that viewers are led to believe in 
a false possibility within the over-
personified and simplified politics 
of shows like “The West Wing.”

Yet, the more prevailing effect 

that TV political dramas have on 
their misinformed viewers is con-
vincing them of a darker reality in 
which politicians operate. To put it 
simply, to be a politician within this 
country, one must also be a socio-
path. The political drama “House 
of Cards” bludgeons this point to 
death. Within America, Kevin Spac-
ey’s character seems to have molded 
the archetype for politicians: an 
apolitical madman who uses pol-
icy and his position solely for the 
advancement of his power.

What’s more is the contrast 

between the U.K. and U.S. ver-

sions of “House of Cards.” In the 
U.K. version, the main protago-
nist’s self-interest and desire to 
gain and hold power is rooted in 
the fact that he believes his poli-
cy agenda and legislative ability 
will come to benefit the country. 
His ruthless acts are thereby a 
means to a rational end. In con-
trast with the U.S. version, the 
protagonist comes off as almost 
apolitical throughout the entire 
show. His ambitions are simply to 
become the most powerful man in 
the world. This presents the idea 
that the problem with American 
politics is not borne of a particular 
party or ideology, but rather the 
American political system itself 
— that, in fact, our political land-
scape is dominated not by partisan 
hawks or doves, but by a power-
hungry class of elites competing 
for influence and domination. 

Yet these shows are made for 

one purpose, for my sister to sit on 
the edge of our couch hanging on 
every word. Is it the responsibil-
ity of TV networks and producers 
to ensure an accurate representa-
tion of American politics is deliv-
ered to their audience? Of course 
not — these are TV dramas meant 
to capture massive audiences and 
achieve high ratings. The writers 
and producers of these shows are 
simply capitalizing on the igno-
rance and disdain toward the 
American political machine.

Besides, some may argue a posi-

tive effect is that these shows have 
helped push more people to become 
involved in the political landscape 
of America, due to their newfound 
interest these shows have fostered. 
Does not the benefit (a more politi-
cally interested public), outweigh 
the costs (a few inaccuracies and 
over dramatizations)?

No. Though these shows indi-

vidually may have a few inac-
curacies or oversimplifications, 
their aggregate effect relates to 
the overall problem that is the 
reason why these dramas have 
become a success. These shows 
capitalize on how the present-
day American citizenship is too 
misinformed, untrustworthy and 
divided toward its government 
and politicians. Add in the rising 
intensity of partisanship, and this 
lack of pragmatism leads to strict, 
often ignorant, blind party ideol-
ogy alignment.

Most importantly today, this 

phenomenon allows for the emer-
gence of unorthodox candidates 
capitalizing 
on 
this 
growing 

hatred. These shows that add to 
this negative perception can only 
lead to further missteps within our 
political system. How much will 
the misrepresentations and inac-
curacies affect the voting decisions 
of the general public? It appears as 
if the presidential election cycle of 
2016 has answered that.

Montemarano, Ramirez 
enjoy summer as interns

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

Earlier this summer, Abby 

Ramirez’s family joked with her 
that she might have been part of 
an international scandal.

Just about 12 hours before the 

incident that implicated Ryan 
Lochte in an alleged falsification 
of a police report, Ramirez had 
met the legendary swimmer.

“My family and stuff were 

like, ‘Oh, you were probably 
involved,’ joking around and 
stuff,” Ramirez said. “But it was 
still cool to meet him and other 
athletes.”

It was all part of her job this 

summer.

Life 
for 
student-athletes 

during the offseason is different 
from that of the professional 
athlete — while most pros can 
focus solely on training and 
recovering, 
student-athletes 

often take classes or look for 
summer jobs or internships, all 
while continuing to train.

And for Michigan softball 

senior third baseman Lindsay 
Montemarano 
and 
senior 

shortstop Ramirez, that held 
especially true. While they may 
have finished playing in June, that 
was just the beginning of what 
would prove to be an eventful and 
life-changing summer.

Montemarano, 
an 
English 

major, 
spent 
her 
offseason 

interning 
with 
the 
New 

York Mets, while Ramirez, a 
communications major, worked 
for NBC during the Olympics in 
Rio de Janeiro.

They 
both 
found 
their 

internships 
with 
the 
help 

of 
the 
University: 
Ramirez 

heard of the NBC internship 
through 
MPact, 
a 
program 

that helps Michigan student-
athletes 
with 
their 
resumes 

and career opportunities, while 
Montemarano was hired in part 
by Fred Wilpon — the owner of 
the Mets, a Michigan graduate 

and the namesake of the Wilpon 
Baseball and Softball Complex in 
Ann Arbor.

For Montemarano, her role 

with the Mets meant working at 
all home game days, where she 
was assigned different tasks, such 
as working at booths or helping to 
set up postgame concerts.

She also showed off her 

softball skills once in a while — 
though it was with investment 
bankers and children rather than 
Big Ten competition.

“Sometimes there were clinics, 

and we would have to work those 
with the coaches,” Montemarano 
said. “One time, I stood with one 
of the coaches and one of the kids 
was like, ‘Girls can’t play softball.’ 
The coach said, ‘Well, she plays 
for Michigan!’ and a little girl 
asked me for my autograph, 
which was cool.”

There was also one instance 

when Montemarano met both 
Jeff and Fred Wilpon — a meeting 
during which the elder Wilpon 
told Montemarano he had been 
following her and her team 
throughout the season and was 
hoping to return to Ann Arbor 
sometime for a game.

“Being able to network with so 

many people shows you how great 
this University is and how they 
really do want to help their own,” 
Montemarano said. “It’s good 
to know our alumni understand 
how great of an education we get 
and how great this University is.”

Meanwhile, a typical day for 

Ramirez began with her leading 
NBC clients on a tour, before 
spending the afternoon usually 
working on office tasks such 
as ticket coordination, guest 
communication 
or 
writing 

daily newsletters. The evening, 
however, 
was 
perhaps 
her 

favorite part of her internship. 
She was able to attend Olympic 
events as a spectator, watching 
athletes such as Michael Phelps 
compete.

Though 
she 
was 
initially 

apprehensive about going to Rio 
given the conditions, Ramirez 
found that it was nothing like her 
preconceived notions.

“Lindsay and everyone kept 

saying, ‘Don’t get Zika,’ so I 
was a little nervous about that,” 
Ramirez said. “They were also 
saying it was very dangerous 
out there, so I just made sure I 
was aware of everything. But it 
definitely exceeded expectations. 
Everyone was really friendly and 
it was a really beautiful place 
with breathtaking views.

“I was pleasantly surprised 

because I was expecting bad 
things. It was definitely better 
than the media perceived it as.”

Ramirez was grateful for 

her internship and admitted 
it was good to take a step back 
from softball, especially given 
the ending to her junior season. 
But softball wasn’t too far from 
her mind: Ramirez was quick 
to add that she spent most of 
her summer training with her 
teammates in Ann Arbor.

Both 
Ramirez 
and 

Montemarano are back in Ann 
Arbor now, continuing life as 
students 
and 
preparing 
for 

fall exhibition games like they 
usually do this time of year.

And 
though 
they 
both 

acknowledge that there’s a finality 
to it all, with their final season 
beckoning, the two seniors are 
simply looking to finish their 
Michigan careers the way they 
want to: on their own terms.

“If you think about it as, ‘This 

is my last year,’ it can get to you 
in your head, like, ‘Oh this is 
my last chance,’ ” Ramirez said. 
“So we like to think about it as 
(being leaders) of Team 40. We 
get to set the example and show 
them the ropes. We’re excited 
for that, and it’ll be a cool 
experience.”

Added Montemarano: “Our 

ultimate goal is to win a national 
championship. 
That 
doesn’t 

change.”

Quartet to be inducted to 
Michigan’s Hall of Honor

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In a few weeks, Mark Dona-

hue, Lorne Howes, Kate John-
son and Jon Urbanchek will 
join the likes of Gerald Ford, 
Bob Ufer, Bo Schembechler and 
more than 200 others who have 
changed the Michigan Athletic 
Department over the years.

Michigan 
announced 

Wednesday that it will induct 
the quartet into its Hall of 
Honor on Sept. 30. The Hall of 
Honor, established in 1978, rec-
ognizes figures who have made 
significant contributions to the 
Athletic Department in the 
form of national or conference 
championships, team captaincy 
or All-American or All-Confer-
ence honors.

Donahue, 
Howes, 
John-

son and Urbanchek will bring 
the total in the Hall to 217. 
Last 
year’s 
inductees 
were 

Lloyd Carr, Brent Lang, John 
Matchefts and Elise Ray.

Donahue 
played 
offensive 

guard for the Michigan football 
team from 1974 to 1977, winning 
three Big Ten championships 
under Bo Schembechler. He 
also earned All-America honors 
twice and started 35 games — 
which was, at that time, second 
in school history — as the Wol-
verines went 38-7 and reached 
two Rose Bowls.

Howes 

played hockey 
in the 1950s. 
As 
Michi-

gan’s 
goalie, 

he 
led 
the 

Wolverines 
to 
national 

champion-
ships in 1955 
and 
1956. 

Those 
two 

were the last 
of Michigan’s five titles in six 
years under coach Vic Heyliger. 
In 1956, in his last career game, 
Howes played “most of the third 
period in severe pain resulting 
from a collision in the opening 
minute of the third stanza,” the 

Daily reported. He also played 
with bone chips in his elbow.

Johnson, a rower for Michi-

gan, graduated in 2001. She 
won All-America honors three 
times and the Big Ten Rower of 

the Year award 
twice. Compet-
ing in the early 
years of Michi-
gan 
rowing, 

Johnson 
was 

instrumental 
in the growth 
of the program. 
At 
the 
2001 

NCAA Cham-
pionships, the 
Wolverines, in 

their fifth season as a varsity 
program, finished third.

“We had a national champi-

onship race in us,” she told the 
Daily at the time, but added, 
“My goal coming to Michigan 
was to set a tradition. I feel com-

fortable leaving now because 
I feel we have arrived.” Since 
then, the Wolverines have won 
three more Big Ten champion-
ships.

Urbanchek 
coached 
the 

Michigan men’s swimming and 
diving team to more than two 
decades of success from 1982 
to 2004. He won 13 Big Ten 
titles — 10 straight from 1986 
to 1995 — plus the 1995 national 
championship. He is already in 
the 
international 
swimming 

and state of Michigan sports 
Halls of Fame. And yet, in 2006, 
Urbanchek told the Daily, “The 
awards will all tarnish with age. 
But the memories will remain 
vivid throughout the years.”

All four inductees will bring 

back those memories when the 
University honors them during 
the Oct. 1 football game against 
Wisconsin, after a private cer-
emony Sept. 30.

Michigan’s starting 

QB has been a 

‘different Wilton’ 
from last summer

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

When 
explaining 

the 
competition 
to 
his 

quarterbacks, 
passing 
game 

coordinator Jedd Fisch used a 
racing analogy.

“Wilton 
had 
the 
pole 

position after spring,” Fisch 
said. “He kind of had a little bit 
of an edge. The race started, 
and the green flag was waved, 
and people were trying to 
pass people, but he just kind 
of never got passed. He just 
continued to play better. Coach 
Harbaugh always says, ‘Iron 
sharpens iron,’ and I think 
what happened was John and 
Shane started playing better 
and so did Wilton.

“It was just one of those deals 

where nobody lost a job, it was 
that Wilton, going into the 
opening day, had won the job.”

And after seeing Speight 

start 
for 
the 
first 
time 

Saturday, Fisch is happy with 
his decision, saying he couldn’t 
have asked for too much better. 

As far as Fisch is concerned, 

Speight’s biggest mistakes were 
his three missed passes. On one 
incompletion, he threw up a 
deep ball for fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Amara Darboh, 
but it was underthrown. On 
another, Fisch says, Speight got 
turned around on a flat route. 

The first mistake, the one 

that kicked off Speight’s career 
as a starting quarterback, was 
an interception. Speight was 
rushed, and Fisch says that 
even though senior tight end 
Jake Butt didn’t run a great 
route, the ball should have 
never left Speight’s hands.

When 
it 
came 
time 
to 

talk to his quarterback on 
the sidelines following the 
interception, 
Fisch 
never 

considered disciplining him. 

“The school that I was from 

is you coach ’em as hard as 
you 
want 

on 
Sunday 

through 
Friday, 
and 

then 
on 

Saturday 
— I mean, 
you 
gotta 

be 
their 

advocate on 
game 
day,” 

Fisch 
said. 

“Because 
they’re the only ones who are 
really going through the war 

on that game day situation. 
To second guess and question 
things on game day and to be 
overly critical on game day, I 
don’t know where the value is.” 

After the game, Speight 

said that he laughed off the 

interception 
with 
Harbaugh. He 
went 10-for-12 
following 
the 

pick, 
looking 

settled 
and 

confident, 
checking out of 
the game in the 
third 
quarter 

to get some rest 
after throwing 

for three touchdowns. 

The leap in his level of play 

from a year ago has shown, 
especially compared to where 
he was in last year’s camp.

“He’s had a big jump, there’s 

no question about that,” Fisch 
said. “From this point in time, 
going into the game one of last 
year, between that and about 
75 reps in all of camp, then to 
where he’s at at this point in 
time, yeah, it’s a huge jump, 
and I give him a lot of credit 
for it.”

Part of his growth, Fisch 

said, can be attritubuted to 
playing behind Jake Rudock and 
knowing he was only one play 
away from entering the game.

“We expect certain things 

from every one of our players,” 
Fisch said. “We expect them to 
call the play in the huddle the 

same way whether they’re the 
first quarterback or the fifth 
quarterback. 
Their 
cadence 

should sound the same way if 
they’re the first quarterback 
or the fifth quarterback. And 
I think that what (Speight) 
realized is that’s the standard 
we’re going to have here and 
because of that, hopefully your 
only option is to improve.”

After 
that 
realization, 

Speight did progress — at 
least slightly faster than his 
competitors — and ended up 
with the starting job. Now, 
Michigan fans will wait to see 
what he does with it.

“It’s 
a 
different 
Wilton 

nowadays,” Fisch said. “It’s 
definitely a more confident 
guy.”

“It was one 
of those deals 
where nobody 

lost a job.”

Seasoned secondary anchors ‘M’ defense

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team’s 

defense made a first impression 
Saturday befitting its hype. The 
star-studded unit flew around 
and came at Hawaii from every 
angle, flustering the opposing 
offense as they did last year. 
They didn’t give up so much as 
a positive play until the third 
series.

But their defensive backs are 

old enough to know that if they 
hadn’t held up their end of the 
deal, it could’ve been a much 
different opener.

“If you get beat, that’s a 

touchdown,” 
said 
fifth-year 

senior cornerback Jeremy Clark 
on Tuesday.

Clark himself broke up a pass 

on the first series of the game, 
forcing the first of many third-
and-long 
situations for the 

Rainbow Warriors, who didn’t 
convert on any of them.

While Michigan’s secondary 

was important in getting stops 
in those situations, it was also 
crucial for them to create them 
in the first place. Coordinator 
Don Brown’s defense features a 
myriad of blitz packages, which 
rely on the defensive backs to 
hold their own.

“That was one of the things 

we talked about the first day 
when we came in — we gotta 
be able to play man-to-man 
coverage as a secondary, because 
Coach Brown is going to bring 
pressure,” said Brian Smith, one 
of Michigan’s two secondary 
coaches. “That’s the key to the 
whole defense — you gotta be 
able to hold up man to man.”

The 
defensive 
backs 

understand that, along with 
many other keys to being a 
top-ranked defense, because 
of 
their 
experience. 
The 

Wolverines boast six true or 
fifth-year seniors, five of whom 
are three-time lettermen — 

most in the Big Ten. (Minnesota 
and Ohio State have as many or 
more seniors, but a handful are 
redshirts or walk-ons.)

Michigan can run out a stable 

of seasoned defensive backs: 
Clark, 
senior 
cornerbacks 

Channing 
Stribling 
and 

Jourdan 
Lewis 
and 
senior 

safeties Dymonte Thomas and 
Delano Hill. Fifth-year senior 
safety AJ Pearson adds depth. 
The Wolverines didn’t even use 
Lewis, who is still recovering 
from an injury, and still fielded 
an all-senior defensive backfield 
on Saturday.

It’s a good group to coach for 

Smith, who is in his first year at 
Michigan after leaving his post 
as the assistant secondary coach 
for the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. 
Though the senior defensive 
backs already had plenty of 
game experience before Smith 
and 
Brown 
arrived, 
they 

have adapted well to the new 
coaches.

“With a new system coming 

in, that’s one of the things you 
always worry about, especially 
with an older group — are they 
going to buy into the system?” 
Smith 
said. 
“They’ve 
been 

receptive to everything we’ve 
taught 
them. 
They 
were 

successful in the past, and 
just their willingness to learn 
the system and be open to it, 
that was the best thing for me. 
They’ve been a great group, an 
easy group to coach, and it’s 
been a lot of fun so far.”

Together, the defensive backs 

have 63 career starts, and that 
doesn’t even count redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers, who 
came to Michigan as a defensive 
back but plays all over the field, 
mostly at linebacker now.

Saturday, 12 of Hawaii’s 23 

passes went to Hawaii receivers, 
while two were intercepted and 
returned for touchdowns and 
three more were broken up. 
The Wolverines gave opponents 

similar headaches in many 
games last season.

“They communicate really 

well,” said sophomore wide 
receiver Grant Perry. “They 
messed 
up 
like 
one 
time 

(when) I was in (during camp), 
and after that, they really 
didn’t 
make 
any 
mistakes. 

Great communicators, unreal 
athletes. They’re good. They’re 
going to be hard to deal with for 
other teams, for sure.”

That effort Saturday was, of 

course, without the services of 
Lewis, the team’s best lockdown 
cornerback. The All-American 
should return this week, adding 
important depth to the unit for 
a game against Central Florida’s 
up-tempo offense.

The defensive backs will be 

out on their own islands again 
for that game, but after four 
years, there’s very little they 
haven’t 
seen 
before, 
which 

makes it easier for them to learn.

“Just the little things that 

they pick up on — a lot of 
younger guys, they don’t get the 
big picture, but these older guys, 
having been in three different 
systems, they kind of get the big 
picture,” Smith said. “So little 
things that you normally have 
to spend more time on, they 
just pick it up and they go, so it 
makes it easier.”

Brown and the rest of the 

defensive coaches will point out 
those subtleties in meetings, 
keeping the standard high. 
After the unit delivered another 
dominant 
performance 
in 

allowing 
just 
three 
points 

against Hawaii, the Wolverines 
were disappointed they gave up 
even that many.

But even that is something 

they have done before. Last 
season, before they went on a 
run of three straight shutouts, 
they gave up single touchdowns 
to UNLV and Brigham Young 
and still saw it as room to 
improve.

“To a newcomer, it’s probably 

difficult,” Clark said. “But if 
you’ve been here for a while, 
we’ve been around the same 
guys, so we’ve been holding 
each other to a standard from 
that point, from the get-go.”

A weekend at Mary Court and Greenwood


2B — Thursday, September 8, 2016

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

At most parties, you can either 

feel lost or lose yourself.

Depending on the atmosphere 

and location, a party — more 
specifically, a college party — is 
the space for young people to 
dance, talk, drink, smoke, laugh, 
make out and interact with 
strangers and friends.

A party can be an unnerving 

experience, even a mediocre one 
at that. The place may be too 
crowded or too empty, the music 
may be wack, or it just might not 
be your night.

But with the right people 

and elements, a party can be a 
fun and ultimately worthwhile 
event. Whether in the humid, 
suffocating intimacy of an 
enclosed fraternity basement, the 
spaciousness of a house shindig 
or the rowdiness of an outdoor 
function, every party, whether 
big or small, has something 
to offer to the overall college 
experience.

During this past Welcome 

Week, many students embarked 
on their first, 13th or perhaps 
40th college party, excited about 
the prospects of each evening 
and already nauseous from 
stuffing down five Smirnoff shots 
and a PBR only moments before. 
Before an equally promising and 
nerve-racking semester at the 
University of Michigan would 
ensue, these several nights 
allowed students, new and old, to 
utilize their independence, forget 
about their everyday worries and 
indulge in a much-needed dose of 
going out.

Last Friday and Saturday 

night, many got to have 
that satisfying release of 
unadulterated freedom at 
the annual Mary Court and 
Greenwood Block Parties, which 
respectively exemplified some 
of the typical “college party” 
attributes: throwback songs, 
drunkards galore and lots of 
uncomfortable pushing and 
shoving.

Friday night at Mary Court
At Mary Court, a neat 

corner tucked away from the 
quiet streets of Ann Arbor, a 
cacophony of voices permeated 
the cool Friday night air with 
a tinge of exuberance. Set in 
a gravel patch between two 
parallel rows of solid-colored 
bungalows, the Mary Court 
Block Party was already in 
motion by 10:30. The venue was 
pretty crowded, consisting of a 
varied cast of normal-looking 
and eccentric characters: girls in 
skimpy outfits; boys wearing tank 
tops and basketball jerseys; three 
blondes holding fruit punch 
Gatorades and Snapchatting 
themselves; a dude in a Hawaiian 
shirt turning up way too hard to 
Kevin Gates’s “Really Really;” a 
G-Eazy doppelganger with a jean 
jacket, a septum nose ring and 
’90s glasses attempting to do a 
cool smoke trick; a guy casually 
wearing a Yoshi hat helmet. A 
Bernie Sanders cardboard cutout 
also made a guest appearance.

The acrid stench of cigarette 

smoke was palpable from all 
around, while red Solo cups 
were scattered on the ground, 
some crushed and others plain 
empty. Near the first house 
at the beginning of the block, 
the snarling snare and blaring 
bass reverberated from the 
speakers, blasting an eclectic 
mix of EDM, Rae Sremmurd, 
the Chainsmokers and Kanye 
West. Even Natasha Bedingfield’s 
“Unwritten” played at one point, 
prompting everyone to unearth 
their 2004 selves and belt out the 
unforgettable chorus in unison.

As many danced uneasily and 

engaged in excited conversations, 
the focus was directed toward 
the Mary Court party’s main 
attraction: the tall tree trunk 
standing on the edge of the block. 
A mixed wave of anxiety and 
awe washed over the crowd, as 

gung ho partygoers climbed to 
the top of the trunk and were 
consequently met with people 
chanting “Jump!” It was mostly 
drunk dudes who ascended 
this formidable leafless tree. 
In particular, one of the many 
guys wearing basketball jerseys 
sat proudly atop the trunk, 
alternating between chugging 
a 40 of malt liquor and smoking 
a cigarette with unabashed 
bravado. The looks on people’s 
faces, which were mostly 
obscured by the light from the 
surrounding lampposts, ranged 
from concerned to astonished. 
Luckily, none of the tree climbers 
got injured once they climbed 
back down to the ground and 
resumed their party-going 
experience.

Despite the high energy 

exuded from the block party, 
Mary Court was relatively 
mild. Sure, walking through 
a highly concentrated throng 
of people was a bit rough and 
overwhelming. Pivoting in place 
without bumping into someone 
is nearly impossible at any party. 
But considering its outside 
location, Mary Court kept things 
under control and acted as a nice 
alternative to the usual confined, 
sweat-inducing spaces of frat or 
house parties. As for the next 
night, the Greenwood Block 
Party would prove that a balance 
between a positive atmosphere 
and controlled chaos is key to a 
successful social gathering. 

Saturday night at 

Greenwood

Saturday morning’s tailgating 

and the afternoon opening 
football game against Hawaii 
left many students exhausted 
and sunburned, but that didn’t 
stop most from venturing to the 
Greenwood Block Party later that 
night. Greenwood was especially 
hyped up after last year’s blowout 
got shut down early by the police.

“I wanted it to be bigger than 

previous years,” wrote Charles 
Antonelli, a Kinesiology senior 
and the main organizer of the 
Greenwood Block Party. In 
an email interview, Antonelli 
also remarked that “usually, 
it’s tradition to have the party 
on a Thursday but I didn’t put 
that as an immediate option 
because more people show up on 
weekends.” 

More elongated and spacious 

than Mary Court, the asphalt 
road of Greenwood Avenue 
lies between two rows of brick 
houses, each consisting of brown, 
yellow, white and blue colors. In 
order to avoid getting shut down 
early, the party commenced 
around 8:15 and was already 
packed by 9 p.m.

Because of the block’s large 

capacity, the amount of people this 
time was even more than Mary 
Court’s, but comprised of more 
or less the same kind of people: 
dudes in long-sleeved Vineyard 
Vines shirts, short sleeve button 
downs and polos and girls in 
loose clothing and tank tops. No 
crazy costumes or faux hipsters 
were in sight.

A giddy sensory overload 

dominated Greenwood’s vibe: 
beer bottles shattered on the 
ground, a twin bed mattress 
being carried around and friend 
groups screaming with glee 
as their jam was played from a 
distance. While hundreds of antsy 
interactions were happening, the 
bumping sound waves of Chance 
the Rapper’s “All Night,” Mike 
Posner’s ubiquitous “I Took A Pill 
in Ibiza (Seeb Remix),” generic 
trap music and even a live band 
pulsated throughout the street.

Like the previous night’s 

rendition of “Unwritten,” the 
crowd screeched when Neil 
Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” came 
on and predictably screamed the 
obligatory “BUM BUM BUM!” 
line. The Killers’ “Mr. Brightside” 
and Jimmy Eat World’s “The 
Middle” — two college party 
favorites — were also played and 

sung during the night. On the 
balcony of one of the Greenwood 
houses, you could see an entire 
horde of people there, all huddled 
together like a colony of penguins 
in the Arctic, the glow of their 
phone screens and camera flashes 
flickering like millennial fireflies.

Similar to Mary Court, the 

party’s collective attention was 
once again drawn to people 
climbing a tall structure in the 
midst of the block, this time a 
telephone pole. The reactions 
were nearly identical, with many 
cheering and yelling for people to 
jump and others cowering with 
uneasiness. Safety, however, is 
something that Antonelli noted 
as imperative for a party as huge 
as Greenwood.

“We always keep an eye out 

for people who are drinking 
too much and making sure 
no damage happens to our 
neighboring houses,” Antonelli 
wrote. “The block kind of 
watches out for each other in 
that respect. The block party is 
fun, but not at the expense of 
someone’s safety.”

Climbing a telephone pole 

is certainly a cause for danger, 
but luckily, no one got hurt, and 
the party resumed in normal 
fashion. No belligerent drunks 
instigated a fight, despite some 
incoherent screaming. Not 
even the two cars that drove 
through the avenue could stop 
Greenwood from collapsing into 
disarray. A random Greenwood 
attendee happened to jump on 
one of the cars, though it was 
unclear as to whether or not the 
driver was just passing through 
or purposefully cruised through 
the street to show off. The scene 
certainly wasn’t as frenetic as the 
climactic Deathmobile sequence 
in “Animal House,” but it was still 
just as awesome and rebellious. 
Greenwood stayed alive until 
its inevitable end at around 11:15 
when the police arrived, which 
Antonelli hadn’t expected, 
writing that he anticipated 
them to come much earlier, at 
10:00. Nevertheless, this caused 
participants to flee in random 
directions and perhaps venture to 
another recreational excursion, 
or South U Pizza for some late-
night grub.

Just like Mary Court, 

Greenwood represented what a 
large party can offer: solid music, 
an open space and good vibes. 
To paraphrase from F. Scott 
Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” 
large parties can be intimate and 
small parties usually don’t have 
as much privacy. Large parties 
can definitely feel somewhat 
daunting, especially if you enter 
one alone or if you’ve never been 
to one before. However, with 
the right attitude and people, 
they don’t have to feel like they 
are. Ideally, everyone is there to 
enjoy themselves and relish in 
the pleasure of being young and 
uninhibited from responsibility 
(at least, in the moment). 

Final thoughts
But what makes a party fun 

isn’t just the party itself. It’s the 
people, the friends you’re with 
who contribute to the overall 
experience. Most parties in 
general are mundane and can 
become routine outings. They 
can be anxiety-inducing and 
scary. Many questions may 
linger in your mind before going 
out: Am I going to get plastered? 
Will I make out with someone 
tonight? Will I meet “the one?” 
Is a fight going to break out? 
Will the party get shut down 
before anything fun or crazy 
happens?

All of those questions are 

valid, but remember this: the 
night is young. Being with your 
friends makes the most out of 
your social experience of college 
and it’s not too late to go out 
to a party with them, dance 
like nobody’s watching, kiss a 
random person (or don’t!) and 
just live in the moment.

XL RECORDINGS

Screaming into the void.

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Food Columnist

I can’t point to the moment I 

first fell in love with cooking. It 
was a gradual process, shaped 
by years of experiences. I 
can recall early memories of 
kneading dough for rugelach 
in my grandmother’s kitchen, 
studying breaded chicken sizzle 
in a frying pan guarded by my 
mom and watching “Iron Chef” 
on Food Network after school.

Food has always been central 

to my family life and early 
experiences, but it became 
something that I identified 
with 
personally 
soon 
after 

I began high school. At this 
point, my family had moved 
back to Israel, plucking me from 
my newly settled life as a high 
school freshman and thrusting 
me 
into 
a 
culture 
I 
was 

unaccustomed to. In the frenzy 
of assimilating to sights, sounds 
and language unfamiliar to me, 
I took comfort in one of the only 
factors of my existence that had 
always been a constant: food.

Soon after our frantic move, 

I developed a taste for foods 
no longer as easily available 
to me as they were when I 
lived in the U.S. Determined 
to still consume them, I took 
to internet recipes. Soon I 
could recite chocolate chip 
cookie and cupcake recipes 
from memory and improvise 
entire meals without a second 
thought. 
Indulging 
in 
the 

comfort 
of 
familiar 
foods 

secured my confidence and 
eased my transition into this 
new and unfamiliar world. 
The more I cooked, the more 
self-assured I became in the 
kitchen — constantly seeking 
out guidance from food blogs 
and feeding my curiosity (no 
pun intended) for new recipes 
and techniques.

The knack for cooking I 

picked up during one of the 
most tumultuous periods of my 
life has stuck with me to this 
day, and for that I’m extremely 
grateful. When I come home 
after 
a 
long, 
sometimes 

difficult day, nothing eases my 
stress or clears my mind like 

rhythmically 
stirring 
sauce 

or sautéing veggies over the 
stove. 
Trying 
new 
recipes 

makes me feel motivated and 
inspired. And snapping a pic of 
a perfectly golden pie crust or 
beautifully frosted cake fills me 
with pride.

Now a college senior (on 

a college budget), food and 
cooking hold a different place in 
my life — though they are of no 
less importance. Living on my 
own has transformed the way 
I perceive and experience both 
the ways in which I use and 
consume food. The stereotype 
that college students eat poorly 
due to lack of time, money and 
effort has in little to no way 
defined 
or 
diminished 
my 

passion for cooking. Nor is it 
reflective of how students eat.

Firstly, I apologize if you’re 

currently 
reading 
this 
in 

between spoonfuls of Kraft 
Mac 
& 
Cheese. 
This 
isn’t 

intended to make anyone feel 
badly about their eating habits 
or culinary skill level (I myself 
enjoy 
the 
occasional 
bowl 

of Easy Mac, though I much 
prefer 
homemade 
mac 
and 

cheese). During a time that is 
characterized by the particular 
difficulty 
of 
juggling 
our 

academic and social lives with 
our health (yes, I’m looking at 
you, Skeeps Thursday $1 Long 
Islands and late-night NYPD), 
what 
we 
eat 
is 
especially 

important — for both our 
mental and physical health.

The truth of this statement 

occurs to me each time I whip 
up a pot of homemade chicken 
soup to cure a finals-induced 
cold or feel soothed by making 
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
deals 

(meals?) after a stressful day of 
classes. Though cooking may 
be easily dismissed by some 

as an expenditure of time and 
money that they can’t afford 
while in school, and for some 
that may be the case, cooking 
is so ingrained into my being 
that going without it seems 
unimaginable. Like running or 
writing is for some, cooking is 
a passion and an extension of 
who I am that fits into my life 
no matter the circumstances. 
Since 
attending 
college, 

altering the way it fits into my 
life has become an exciting and 
important life lesson.

I now revel in the challenge 

of coming up with something 
tasty to make out of refrigerated 
leftovers, pantry items or those 
last three ingredients I have 
lying in my fridge before I give 
in and go grocery shopping. 
The feeling of triumph derived 
from 
easily 
converting 

ingredients 
into 
something 

new and delicious trumps the 
gratification of immediately 
satisfying my hunger with a 
meal procured from the freezer 
or a carryout box. Taking the 
time and energy to cook my 
meals that challenge the habits 
I developed while cooking at 
home has made me feel like 
I’ve begun to shape a lifestyle 
of my own that will continue 
on after college. Whether it’s 
academically or socially, being 
in college provides us every 
day with the opportunity to 
do something that will shape 
who we are once we leave our 
beloved Ann Arbor.

Learning to transfer a part of 

my life that I was accustomed 
to before school and that was 
spurred by a change similar to 
the one we undergo while in 
college has made me appreciate 
its presence in my life all the 
more. Now that I’ve grown as 
a cook while in college, I feel 
all the more empowered to 
take on whatever awaits me 
once I leave (especially now 
that I’m a senior). No matter 
what happens, I’ll always have 
cooking.

Why I learned to love 

to cook

I’ll always have 

cooking, no 
matter what.

Daily Music Editor

Earlier 
this 
week, 
my 

roommate and I attempted to 
nail down life’s crucial question: 
Who is America’s sweetheart? 
We eventually settled on the 
fact that we’re living through 
a sweetheart-less moment in 
America, but now, I realize 
we 
were 
wrong. 
America’s 

sweetheart is, in fact, British. 
And her name is Adele.

The singer played the first of 

two sold-out gigs at The Palace 
of Auburn Hills Tuesday night. 
Lasting 
almost 
two 
hours, 

Adele’s show is timeless and 

overwhelmingly personable — 
not unlike the singer herself. 
The dichotomy of Adele’s soul-
crushing sound and boisterous 
personality proved to be a killer 
combination; when she wasn’t 
hitting every note, she was 
cracking jokes between songs. 
Topics ranged from her love of 
day-drinking, a hip-hop class 
she’s taking and even landlines.

With a sporadic touring history, 

Adele tactfully paid homage to all 
of her studio albums, 19, 21 and 25 
Tuesday. Opening with “Hello,” 
she emerged from the B-stage 
serenading the back half of the 
arena before turning toward the 
front on the first chorus.

The night consisted entirely 

of Adele standing, occasionally 
swaying and hitting every note. 
The setlist was comprised of her 
signature 
ballads, 
save 

a short, seated 
acoustic 
set 

and a pair of 
songs 
that 

have 
“actual 

beats” 
— 

a 
quality 

she 
admits 

confuses her. 
If she was confused, the crowd 
couldn’t tell by her booming 
performance of “Rumour Has 
It” and the impassioned “Water 

Under The Bridge.” And later 
in the show, she drew in all of 
the husbands who got dragged 
out on a Tuesday with a cover 

of “Make You 
Feel My Love” 
by Bob Dylan, 
calling 
Dylan 

the 
“greatest 

songwriter of all 
time.”

The 
show’s 

strongest 
moment 
came 
when 

the chanteuse returned to the 
B-stage for “Chasing Pavements,” 
“Someone Like You” and “Set Fire 
to the Rain.” Each performance 

was special and spectacular in its 
own way. “Chasing Pavements” 
set the groundwork for Adele’s 
rise with 21 and the smash 
success of “Rolling in the Deep.” 
The crowd’s participation during 
the second and third choruses 
of “Someone Like You” is half 
the reason the song feels so 
momentous, but even without 
their 
participation, 
Adele’s 

clear love for the track would 
without a doubt carry it to the 
same lengths. And the final song 
before the encore, “Set Fire to 
the Rain,” found Adele in the 
center of the square platform, 
surrounded by walls of rain on 
all sides.

Performing 
in 
the 
same 

black, sequined ball gown for 
the entirety of the show, Adele 
exuded 
a 
certain 
coolness 

throughout the night. She’s a 
master of stank-face and shoulder 
rolls, and even the “Rolling in the 
Deep” encore had a casualness 
that’s absent without Adele’s 
stage presence. When the arena 
wasn’t filled with her unwavering 
vocals, it was filled with her 
laugh. Adele’s 2016 tour isn’t just 
a showcase of her musical ability; 
it’s a showcase of Adele herself, 
one of the few artists with both

CONCERT REVIEW

America’s 

sweetheart is 

British.


Oh Guy. Oh Guy. Not even 10 minutes into your 

show and the word “food lube” was thrown 

around casually. The nomenclature in “Diners 

Drive-Ins and Dives” is a mix of ’90s gangster 

rap, Dad Jokes and middle-of-the-country-
salt-of-the-Earth-relentless-feel-good 
compliments, but I’m not that upset about 
it? It kinda works? It’s exciting? Or maybe 
that’s just the dizzying speed of these 
camera cuts. I blame my non-diagnosed 
epilepsy on Guy Fieri. And my fear of 
hair gel. And Bowling. We finished one 
episode about Baltimore and have moved 

onto some kind of memorial for Robert Lee. 

God bless the Confederacy am I right friends! 

Somebody. Just. Fed. The Guy. I’m not sure I 

can do anymore justice to this show then to just 

finish this with an extended section of direct quotes 

from 
Diners Drive Ins and Dives that I could also use as pick-up 

lines at Ricks:

“Excellent.”
“After this, you will go home big.”
“You’re something I shoulda seen coming.”
“Everything has a really nice, rich, smoky flavor.”
“Cumin.”
“Here’s something you’ll never see cumin.”
“We’re gonna rub it up.”
“When I walked into this place, I saw the smoke so I knew it had a little bit of funk.”
“I’m a bit off the beaten path, which is fun.” 
“Can you rub this up for me?”
“We’ll just keep it a secret.”
“You like eggs?”
“You really just can’t find anything else like this around here.”
“I’ll be looking for you next time on ‘Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.’”

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

Am I the only one who’s 

noticed a major Stephen King 
resurgence 
lately? 
King’s 

themes of darkness just below 
the surface and supernatural 
horrors lurking in the American 
countryside feel like they’re 
infecting 2016 entertainment 
with the strength and speed of 
a deadly viral outbreak — “The 
Stand” style. 

This 
summer, 
literally 

everyone I know fell hard for 
“Stranger Things,” the Duffer 
Brothers’ loving distillation of 
King’s genre archetypes into a 
six-hour Netflix show. Podcasts 
like “Welcome to Night Vale” 
and 
“Bizarre 
States” 
have 

been 
incorporating 
Kingian 

genre elements into otherwise 
standard, 
ethnographically 

specific American dramas. And 
let’s certainly not forget Robert 
Eggers’s fantastic film “The 
Witch,” the demonic thriller 
that feels ripped from the pages 
of “Jerusalem’s Lot.” Point 
being: there’s a lot of spooky 
stuff coming out lately that 
probably wouldn’t be here if not 
for King’s influence. 

Let me be clear: I’m NOT 

complaining 
about 
how 

much genre stuff there is. 
Dark, 
supernatural, 
make-

stuff-float-with-your-mind 
thrillers are most definitely 
in my wheelhouse (let me rant 
to you sometime about why 
“Chronicle” is one of the greatest 
films of the 21st century). But 
while we’re ripping off King, 
why don’t we look back at his 
more mainstream stuff, too? 
In my humble opinion, I think 
the best thing King ever wrote 
was “The Body,” a novella that 
was released as part of the same 
collection that included the 
inspiration for “The Shawshank 
Redemption.” 
You 
probably 

know it better as “Stand By Me,” 
Rob Reiner’s film adaptation 
from 1986. It’s the story of four 
boys who, after an infamously 
quotable goading from a friend 
(“You guys wanna go see a 
dead body?”), go on a spiritual 
journey through the Maine 
wilderness to find the corpse 
of a kid who was hit by a train. 
It’s an essential exploration 
of 
youthful 
masculinity 
— 

certainly a guy movie, but a 
heartfelt and good one. 

The second I heard about 

Aaron Burch’s book, I knew I 
had to meet him. The concept, 
an 
autobiographical 
and 

analytical 
book 
about 
one 

author’s experience with “The 

Body” and the change in said 
experience 
over 
time, 
was 

immediately 
gripping. 
His 

book is a part of a line called 
“Bookmarked,” 
a 
series 
of 

books about books (books that 
made a “mark” on the author — 
hence, “Bookmarked”). The line 
was inspired by “33⅓,” another 
series of books in which writers 
take an in-depth look at classic 
albums.

“I’ve spent years thinking 

about what I’d write as a 33⅓,” 
Burch said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily.

“But I don’t really think I 

want to write one. And then 
‘The Body’ just came to mind, 
because I love ‘Stand By Me’ 
so much. It’s like, well, that’s 
a movie, and these are books 
about books. But it’s a movie 
based on a book, so I could kind 
of cheat a little bit and write 
about both.”

Burch is an English lecturer 

at the University of Michigan, 
and 
formerly 
at 
Eastern 

Michigan 
University. 
You 

might have taken his “Rhetoric 
of Growing Up” English 124 
section, in which he taught 
King’s 
novel 
among 
other 

coming-of-age 
narratives 
to 

freshman students. He’s a 
young, down-to-earth guy, and 
his enthusiasm for the material 
was quite immediately evident 
— a bright, bearded smile 
shined at me throughout our 
conversation.

“I think I’ve read and loved 

lots of books that I don’t have 
anything to say about,” Burch 
said. 

“I’ve been forced to say 

things about it because I’m the 
teacher, and I have to at least 
pretend to be the authority 
on it. And then, also, (I) can 
end up using that to talk about 
teaching. I have lesson plans 
that I could almost turn into 
essays that (could) become the 
book but I can also talk about 
how that lesson plan worked in 
class.”

Besides teaching and writing, 

Burch also curates Hobart, 
a literary journal. A stuffy, 
stereotypical academic journal 
Hobart is not. It has a sleek, 
indie aesthetic, and frequently 
publishes 
poems, 
nonfiction 

and fiction from a huge variety 
of writers.

“I 
wasn’t 
yet 
seriously 

thinking about if I ever wanted 
to write a book or publish a 
book. I was just doing these 
short little things to entertain 
myself,” Burch said.

“I had just finished college 

and I didn’t know what I was 

doing. And those things were 
fun. And I had a day job at a 
bank which wasn’t fun.”

Burch started the journal in 

2001 as a website. He learned 
how to build in HTML in a 
class and used it as an excuse to 
practice web design.

“And then we started doing 

books at some point,” Burch 
said.

Burch’s 
wife, 
Ellen, 
is 

essentially his creative partner. 
They work on most of their 
literary ventures together — 
though he’s mostly focused on 
the online journal, and these 
days she’s mostly in charge of 
the full-length books.

One of my favorite chapters 

of Burch’s book talks about the 
relationship between Gordie 
(the narrator and protagonist) 
and King himself. Being a video 
game fan, I couldn’t help but 
geek out when Burch compared 
the nature of Gordie’s narration 
to a customizable role-playing 
game protagonist, synthesizing 
an excerpt from a Matt Bell 
essay on “Baldur’s Gate 2.” I 
made sure to grill him about it.

“I don’t just like (that part) 

just because (the narrator) was 
King, and that makes it more 
real. I like it because you can 
feel King peeking out from 
around the corner,” Burch said.

“The 
Body” 
has 
been 

criticized over the years for a few 
things, likely most frequently 
about its almost complete lack 
of female characters. But often 
it seems like people criticize 
fans of “The Body” fans more 
than the text itself — online 
rhetoric around “Stand By Me” 
and “The Body” is extremely 
negative toward those that 
have vigorous nostalgia for the 
stories. I love what Burch had 
to say about the matter.

“I think the reason the book 

and the movie still work is 
because of nostalgia, but I don’t 
think nostalgia alone would 
hold up over so long,” he said.

“It’s easy to be really cynical 

about 
nostalgia 
and 
just 

blanket discount it. I think 
King doesn’t do that at all. He 
really embraces … you know, he 
loved this moment. But saying 
he loved it doesn’t mean it was 
perfect.

“I think one of the important 

things is that they all end up 
going 
their 
separate 
ways. 

It’s not the ‘and then we were 
friends forever’ ending. Or also, 
it doesn’t just end ‘and then the 
summer ended.’ ”

Aaron Burch’s book, “Stephen 

King’s The Body: Bookmarked,” 
is available on Amazon.

THURSDAY
Though rain clouds and light 

showers plagued Grant Park 
on this year’s opening day, the 
energetic atmosphere could not 
be dampened. This impervious 
spirit was embodied by the day’s 
early 
performers 
— 
namely 

Melanie Martinez and Wavves.

Commanding one of Lolla’s 

largest stages, Martinez strutted 
and cooed to the damp masses. 
The rising Voice star sounded 
impeccable, working the large 
stage like a seasoned veteran. 
Sticking 
with 
her 
childlike 

imagery, the pastel stage was 
littered 
with 
larger-than-life 

alphabet blocks and an adult-
sized crib. Against the gray sky, 
Martinez’s colorful performance 
shone.

Creating 
an 
opposite 

atmosphere, 
California 
punk 

band Wavves stepped onto the 
much smaller Pepsi stage shortly 
after Martinez wrapped. With 
high energy and even higher 
volume, Wavves egged on the 
thrashing crowd. The mountain 
of sound fueled the audience’s 
fervor and made for the best punk 
performance of the weekend.

Drawing in much younger 

crowds, especially compared to 
the festival’s other headliners, 
were The 1975 and Lana Del Rey. 
Performing on the large Bud 
Light stage that Martinez graced 

earlier, The 1975 delivered exactly 
the show one would expect from 
the British indie-pop group. 
Singer 
Matt 
Healy 
flounced 

around the stage, prompting the 
young female throngs to swoon 
and shout every word even louder. 
But the intensity of The 1975’s 
crowd looked like child’s play 
once Del Rey took the stage hours 
later. Sauntering and crooning, 
Del Rey moved through her set 
with grace and nearly perfect 
live vocals. Her set was retro and 
dreamy, mimicking the singer’s 
on-stage persona. Though the 
set largely catered to Del Rey’s 
more mainstream successes, the 
audience drank in every song, 
light change and movement with 
rapt adoration. 

FRIDAY
Again, a mass of rain clouds 

rolled over the festival grounds. 
Again, the potential storm in the 
sky did nothing to darken the 
day’s festivities. With headliner 
Radiohead 
on 
the 
horizon, 

crowds once again flocked to 
Grant Park and enjoyed the day’s 
entertainments before swarming 
the Samsung stage that night.

Early in the day, amid a steady 

rain and splatters of mud, MØ 
absolutely 
crushed 
her 
set. 

Performing hits like “Final Song” 
and “Lean On,” MØ had the 
crowd dancing despite water-
related 
technical 
difficulties. 

Even during less well-known 
tracks, 
the 
poncho-wearing 

masses could not stop moving. 

She killed it. Abolished it. Any 
and all phrases for rocking a 
performance can and should be 
applied to MØ’s set.

But for the older sector of 

Friday’s crown, all sights were 
set on Radiohead, who played a 
two-hour set to end the night. 
Opening with “Burn the Witch,” 
off its latest release A Moon 
Shaped Pool, the seasoned group 
rolled through its set list with 
ambition and oddness aplenty. 
Thom Yorke, in his usual fashion, 
gyrated 
and 
grooved 
about 

the stage. The band’s sound 
— melodic, otherworldly and 
droning — steadily washed over 
the eager crowd, prompting new 
cries of enthusiasm with each 
new song. Though long, the set 
was never dull or dragging. The 
stage lights and big screens were 
flickering and fantastical, often 
projecting the band members 
upside-down or disjointed. After 
two encores, the set wrapped 
with “Karma Police,” which 
resonated with the masses well 
after the final chord sounded.

SATURDAY
For those souls brave enough 

to take on all four days, Saturday 
marked the halfway point of their 
Lollapalooza experience. But the 
crowds were not quelled — they 
continued to rage on, even if the 
blisters on their feet were doing 
the same. The highlights of this 
midpoint included Grimes and 
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Grimes took the stage sporting

patched pants, a sheer top and, 
not one, but two sprained ankles. 
She told the crowd of her injury 
and warned them that she may 
not be able to dance as much as 
usual. She then proceeded to 
jump, bop and roll about the stage 
for the remainder of her hour-
long set. Grimes embodied many 
roles on that Lakeshore stage; 
one of producer, singer, dancer 
and art angel. Focusing mainly 
on material from Art Angels, the 
Canadian opened with “Realiti” 
but mixed it up with the inclusion 
of “Be a Body” and a cover of 
“Ave Maria.” Her passion and 
prowess were unmistakable. This 
passion was especially palpable 
during “Scream.” Singing the 
verses in Russian, the chorus was 
marked by Grimes flat on the 
stage, shouting. Every aspect of 
the set oozed Grimes’s ingenuity 
— from the lights to the stark 
stage setup, to the fluid, languid 
motion of her dancers. Wrapping 
with “Kill V. Maim,” Grimes had 
the mass gathered in front of 
her writhing. She was not some 
holier-than-thou figure, but rather 
an artist who gets just as much 
enjoyment out of performing her 
art as her fans do listening to it. 
Undoubtedly, Grimes’s set was one 
of the best of the weekend, if not 
the top performance.

Directly after Grimes stepped 

off Lakeshore, the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers walked onto the 
Samsung stage. Opening with an 

introductory jam that bled into 
“Can’t Stop,” the Chili Peppers 
made it evident from the first note 
that they are still going strong. 
Singer Keidis has maintained 
his chops, as has the rest of the 
group, performing with the zeal 
of a group fresh to the rock scene. 
Their large sound and even larger 
stage presence made the Chili 
Peppers the perfect choice to close 
out the penultimate Lolla evening.

SUNDAY
Sensing the end, the clouds 

parted on this final day and 
brought sunshine and heat to Grant 
Park. The early half of the day was 
smattered with groups ranging 
from FIDLAR to Years & Years. 
The latter brought a bouncing 
energy, enticing audiences with 
their electropop sound. Singer 
Olly Alexander flexed his pipes, 
spitting of riffs with ease. Upping 
the energy, Yellow Claw took the 
stage at Perry’s shortly after. Ever 
the party spot, the Perry’s stage 
is known for hosting some of the 
rowdiest of Lolla’s acts — with 
Yellow Claw being no exception. 
The bass was reverberating and 
the sweat was dripping.

Drawing in a much more 

subdued, 
but 
nonetheless 

enthusiastic, crowd was Halsey. 
Opening with “Gasoline,” the 
21-year-old commanded the open, 
industrially designed stage from 
the first note. Taking the time 
to talk and joke with the crowd, 
Halsey connected with her fans 

rather than running through the 
set nonstop. Her performance 
made clear why this young artist 
has had such exponential success 
with her debut album.

Following Halsey was Flume 

— an EDM artist that found 
himself outside the Perry’s realm. 
Stepping onto the large Samsung 
stage, Flume was accompanied 
only by his equipment and a 
geometric stage design. But the 
music spoke for itself. Washing 
over the human sea gathered 
there, Flume’s mixture of EDM 
beats and other genres and voices 
had the crowd moving for the 
entirety of his set. Showcasing this 
diversity, Vince Staples also made 
an appearance to perform the 
artists’ collaborative song.

Ending the four-day marathon 

was 
LCD 
Soundsystem. 
The 

expert group took the same 
stage earlier graced by Halsey 
and Flume — a testament to 
Lollapalooza’s assortment of ages 
and genres. Though its songs are 
relatively long in length, LCD 
performed with such feeling that 
the crowd never lulled. The funky 
jam band vibe given off prompted 
unabashed dancing, even during 
some 
of 
their 
lesser-known 

songs. The sprawling sound of 
LCD 
Soundsystem’s 
layered 

instrumentation seeped over the 
grounds and onto the surrounding 
streets of downtown Chicago — 
calling listeners to return to Grant 
Park next summer. 

CONCERT REVIEW

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Kanye West premiered (to a 

fair bit of surprise) the music 
video for his 
deep house-
inspired song 
“Fade” at the 
latest itera-
tion of MTV’s 
VMAs. After 
unintelligibly 
rambling for 
four-ish minutes, his appear-
ance falling far from the 
expectations MTV tried to 
drum up, West wiped minds 
and memories with one of the 
most jarring (and captivating?) 
music videos this year.

The video strips (pun 

definitely intended, you 
busters) quite a bit of its 
aesthetic from the ‘80s dance-
drama “Flashdance,” starring 
frequent Kanye collaborator 
(and GOOD Music roster 
member) Teyana Taylor 
dancing around in an empty, 
misty gym. The video is largely 

a string of clips showcasing 
Taylor and her risqué dancing, 
coupled with a sensuously 
candid cut of her and her 
fiancé, Cleveland Cavaliers 
player Iman Shumpert, 
presumably having sex in a 
gym shower before ending 
with a puzzling scene in which 
Taylor finds herself cat-faced 
perched atop a eerily gazing 

Shumpert amid a large flock of 
sheep. It’s bizarre, confusing, 
intriguing and a smorgasbord 
of anything and everything in 
between. I don’t really know 
what to make of it. I think I 
enjoyed it? I dunno. All in all, 
it’s quintessentially Kanye, 
and that’s really the only apt 
descriptor for it all.
