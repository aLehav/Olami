Animal rights
groups cite many
violations
By LARA ZADE
ManagingNewsEditor
The University of Michi-
gan Health System is-under fire
from two animal rights groups
following reports of misconduct
in University laboratory experi-
ments and improper use of fed-
eral funding.
Alka Chandra, a laboratory
oversight specialist for People
for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, said that documents
obtained under the Freedom
of Information Act revealed 33
violations of animal treatment by
the University over a six month
period.
"We have never seen any-
thing like this before in terms of
number of violations in such a
limited period of time," Chandra
said.
In lightcof the findings, Chan-
dra submitted a letter on behalf
of PETA requesting that the Na-
tional Institute of Health revoke
the University's assurances - the
permits that allow researchers to
conduct their experiments.
In the letter, which was ad-
dressed to NIH Director of the
office of Animal Welfare Patricia
Brown, Chandra wrote that the
University displays a "culture of
contempt" toward animal wel-
fare.
Chandra cited examples of
University researchers letting
animals die of starvation, dehy-
dration and beingtrapped in cag-
es that caught on fire. She also
said that a University researcher

A crowd of 40,000
gather once more at
the Big House
By JASMINE ZHU
Daily News Editor
Graduating students in caps and
gowns filed through Michigan Sta-
dium Saturday as this year's gradu-
ation commencement ceremony
returned to its regular venue.
The University of Michigan
Commencement Band played a fit-
ting arrangement of"M Fanfare" for
a crowd of approximately 40,000 to
kick off the ceremony.
Last year, spring commence-
ment exercises were relocated to
the Diag for the first time in the
University's history due to ongoing
construction at the Big House.
University alum Will Rich, who
graduated from the Ford School of
Public Policy last year, said he was
happy to see graduation return to
the Big House.
"It was great," Rich said. "I ac-

tually graduated last year on the
Diag, so it was nice to be able to do
it in the Big House this year."
Throughout the commence-
menteeremony, thespeakersvoiced
a shared sentiment of perseverance
in the face of economic uncertainty.
LSA Dean Terrence McDonald
said that though the class of 2009
is graduating in turbulent times, he
is confident the situation will turn
around.
"America is now, and forever
will be, a good investment," Mc-
Donald said.
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance senior Ariel Arce, who gave
the reflection, said that in spite of
the economic crisis, "It's neverbeen
a better time to be young."
Her optimism was echoed by
LSA senior George Dong, the stu-
dent speaker for the event.
"Yes we can, and yes we will
change the world one day," said
Dong, echoing one of President
Barack Obama's most famous man-
tras.
Dong, who is from Fuhou, Chi-
na, explained that his presence at
the podium was quite an achieve-

ment. When he first came to the
University, he barely spoke English.
Now, Dong will teach English in the
inner city of Chicago as part of the
non-profit organization Teach for
America.
"Although our homes are miles
apart, it's the Michigan experience
that connects us all," Dong said.
Dong ended his speech with a
rousing chorus of "It's Great to be
a Michigan Wolverine," and was
joined by the graduating class.
Larry Page, Google co-founder
and University alum, delivered the
commencement address at the cer-
emony.
Page urged the graduating se-
niors to have a "healthy disregard
for the impossible," citing his per-
sonal obstacles in creating Google.
"Sometimes it's important to
wake up and stop dreaming," said
Page, in reference to how he trans-
formed his vision of Google into a
reality.
Summing up the secret to
changing the world in one sentence,
Page said that the key is to "always
work hard on something that is un-
comfortably exciting."

New research center at the 'U'

Federal funds will
enhance study of
alternative energy
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
Thanks to the United States
Department of Energy funding
a $19.5 million Energy Frontier
Research Center at the Univer-
sity, researchers will be better
equipped to harness alternative
energy forms.
President Barack Obama's
American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act will provide funding for
the research at the University over
the next five years.
Obama announced Monday at
the annual meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences that the EFRC
at the University will be one of 46
research centers in the country.
Two of these centers will be locat-
ed in Michigan, with the other at
Michigan State University.
The EFRC will include a team of
22 researchers from the College of
Engineering and the departments
of Chemistry and Physics in the
College of Literature, Science and

'09 faces tough job market

Graduates must be
patient while
career hunting
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily Staff Reporter
For the class of 2009, graduat-
ing from the University and leav-
ing Ann Arbor is a venture into
uncharted territory.
After entering the Big House as
students and living as graduates,
the recent graduates have headed
off to take jobs and start new proj-
ects all over the world. Regardless
of choice of major, the economy
and turbulent job markets have
affected graduates' decisions and
caused some students to rethink
their career paths.
Recent LSA graduate Tara
Boinpally will be attending medi-
cal school in Cleveland, Ohio but
said that some of her fellow grad-
uates are still unsure about their
future plans.
"I think that some of (my
friends) are changing what they
originally intended to do and are
going to graduate programs," she
said. "Some of them are setting off
on their own and seeing whathap-
pens."
Recent Ross School of Busi-
ness graduate Jeffrey Fishman,
who has secured a job in the fall,
plans to take it easy in the summer
months leading up to the start of
his career.
"For the next three months I
don't have any plans," he said.
"Travel the country, take some
road trips, visit some people. After
that, I'm working for a bank in
New York."
Allan Cotrone, the director of
Career Development and Student
Affairs at the Ross School of Busi-
ness, said that over the past couple
years the trend has been for many
students to take more "socially
responsible careers" like Teach
for America. He said students are
beginning to think about seeking
these types of jobs rather than
more traditional jobs in banking
or consulting.
Cotrone said that this year, 75
percent of graduating Business
School students who responded to
a Business School survey reported
they had secured a job offer by
graduation, which is a 10-percent
decrease from last year's results.
Cotrone attributed the decline
in graduateslanding job offers to
the lagging economy.

Graduates face their futures with eager minds as they celebrate their achievements at Saturday's graduation ceremony.

"I've never seen it as bad as this
for students looking for jobs," he
added.
According to Lynne Sebille-
White, senior assistant director of
employer relations at the Career
Center, the job search for gradu-
ates of the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts isn't much
easier.
She also blamed the economy
for the lack of hiring opportuni-
ties, but said that graduates can
still find jobs if they put in some
extra work.
"The economy has impacted
hiring in many different indus-
tries and geographic locations,"
she wrote in an e-mail interview.
"However, this does not mean no
one is hiring. Job searching is tak-
ing more time and requires flex-
ibility and networking."
Sebille-White said that job
search resources like the Career
Center can be very helpful because
they offer their services to students
up to one year after graduation.
"Tapping alumni networks
via the UM Alumni Association's
inCircle and other networking
tools can be very valuable," she
wrote. "There are also profes-
sional associations in every field
imaginable."
Sebille-White wrote that while
LSA conducts a "destination sur-
vey" for each graduating class,
these surveys are not necessar-
ily predictive and aren't published
until about nine months after
graduation.
She added that the - statistics
for the class of 2008 can't be com-
pared to those of the class of 2009
because the current generation of

graduating students is experienc-
ing a much different economy and
job search.
Sebille-White also wrote that
LSA students are interested in tak-
ing a year or two off after gradua-
tion and working in their desired
field as they were in years with
stable economies.
Students in the College of Engi-
neering are also finding that the
job search is taking longer than
expected.
Cynthia Redwine, director of
the Engineering Career Resource
Center, said students still looking
for jobs should continue to search
and take advantage of networks
and opportunities.
"We encourage students to
maintain a positive attitude, net-
work, expect the search to take a
bit longer (6-9 months) and to not
overlook small and medium size
companies," Redwine wrote in an

e-mail interview.
She also wrote that while there
may not be many jobs out there,
internships are harder to come by
as well.
William Rich, who gradu-
ated with a master's degree from
the Ford School of Public Policy,
offered an optimistic take on the
situation.
"Yeah, everyone is (worried
about jobs)," he said. "A lot of my
classmates are going to a public
sector, and even then it's hard. No
one's really worried about getting
a job in an absolute sense - it's
just taking more time than is con-
venient."

Smoked out-
'U' shouldn't enact outdoor smoking ban

Failing course feedback
University should acknowledge importance of student response

At the end of every semes-
ter, professors and GSIs across
campus say at least a few words
reminding students to fill out
course evaluations. But when the
CTools course evaluations ser-
vice failed, many students lost
the chance to follow their teach-
ers' suggestions. To prevent the
loss of this valuable data in the
future, the University should
make online evaluations more
reliable. The University must
assure students and teachers that
it values the feedback process.

but the evaluations couldn't be
restored. The University had
only received a fraction of the
expected number of evalua-
tions when CTools failed. Some
colleges created supplemental
surveys to get feedback, but the
University itself has not offered
a new evaluation.
The most pressing concern
from this failure is the loss of the
data that comes from teaching
questionnaires. Course evalu-
ations give students a forum to
discuss concerns about courses

ations. But the University won't
do this, arguing that responses
may be skewed since grades
have been posted. The Univer-
sity isn't giving students enough
credit. It could still collect the
data and compare it with previ-
ous semesters to see if the results
are skewed instead of completely
ignoring student concerns.
The failure of online course
evaluations has had a significant
effect on course feedback, and
the University must prevent sim-
ilar failures in the future. One
suggestion would be to move
course evaluations a few weeks
earlier in the semester. But in
the mean time, the University
should have offered supplemen-
tal evaluations to ensure that
student voices are heard. With-
out student feedback, the Uni-
versity cannot rightly call itself a
growing learning community.

tion of new evalu-

smoke in open spaces.
The proposed ban will outlaw
smoking on all University prop-
erty as of July 1, 2011. Univer-
sity Chief Health Officer Robert
Winfield, co-chair of the Smoke
Free University Steering Com-
mittee, explained that the deci-
sion was made to improve the
health of the University commu-
nity. He says the cost of health
care for smokers is at least
$2,000 more than it is for non-
smokers, and fewer smokers on
campus may reduce the Univer-
sity's healthcare expenditures.
Inmanycases,theoverallhealth
needs of campus come first. The
1987 ban on smoking in most Uni-
versity buildings and following
2003 ban in residence halls were
necessary to protect University
students and staff from the health
risks of secondhand smoke. But
eliminating smoking in outdoor
spaces has a negligible benefit
for nonsmokers and substantially
inconveniences smokers. The ban
will force smokers to frequently
travel off campus to places where
they can smoke. Smokers who live

in University dorms and apart-
ments will be even more affected
by the ban.
By banning smoking in outdoor
spaces, the University is not pro-
moting public health, but taking
away a personal choice. The' role
of the University is not to play the
angry parent. Instead, it should
educate people on the issue.
The University can do much
to discourage smoking on cam- .
pus without banning it. It already
plans to offer discounted quitting
treatments and free counseling to
smokers. It could prohibit smok-
ing at entrances to buildings to
protect non-smokers from expo-
sure to secondhand smoke.
Despite the health risks, smok-
ing is still a personal choice. The
University's recent decision to
ban smoking throughout cam-
pus, including outdoors, puts a
severe burden on smokers and
essentially eliminates the right to
make that choice. The University
shouldn't deny students and staff
their rights, and it shouldn't treat
smokers like children.

GSIs need student input

On Apr. 15, GSIs asked their
students an important question:
"How did we do as instructors this
term?" It's exciting for teachers
when students are eager to express
their opinions, as they often are at
the end of the semester. But this
time, most students didn't get the
chance.
That's a shame, because stu-
dents aren't the only ones learning
in University classrooms. Every
day, teachers experiment with new
teaching methods andactivities.
End-of-term teaching evaluations
helpustobothrefineourclassroom
manner and choose the most suc-
cessful of our teaching techniques.
When the CTools evaluation sys-
tem was abruptly taken offline on
Apr. 20, this cycle of experimenta-
tion and feedback came to a halt.
This early closure infuriated
learners on both sides of the podi-
um, but teachers and administra-
tors shouldn't be so surprised at
this. After the fall 2008 semester,
the University delayed the release
of evaluations until well after the
next semester had begun. Feed- ,
back came far too late to influence
the next round of syllabi, textbooks
and course requirements.
Similarly, an Office of Public
Affairs website linked to in an
e-mail by Provost Teresa Sullivan

cites "reasons not yet understood"
for this semester's failure. But we
can take a guess at the reason: The
University unwisely embedded the
evaluations process within anoth-
er computer system of "highest
priority:" CTools. We conjecture
that when, for still murky reasons,
that system crashed, the Univer-
sity chose to sacrifice the part for
the sake of the whole.
CTools has become invaluable
for instruction, especially when
finals approach.But with the details
of the crash so obscure, we worry
that both the network and Uni-
versity administrators in charge
of the evaluations may not be held
accountable. Even worse, we worry
that spring and summer semester
students may not have access to
any evaluation system at all.
Students deserve a voice in
the shaping of their education.
And although evaluation meth-
ods abound, student question-
naires directly link students and
instructors and play a crucial role
in graduate students' professional
development. In response to this
concern, the Graduate Employ-
ees Organization has formed the
Teaching Evaluations Working
Group to ensure the success of
evaluations at the University.
TEWG seeks full disclosure on

the errors of the fall and winter
evaluations, progress reports on
implementation for the spring and
summer semesters and the assur-
ance - perhaps through an online
or paper backup system - that the
University won't settle for "65 per-
cent of the expected responses,"
as they do now, according to the
Office of Public Affairs's website.
The University only collected 62
percent of the number of responses
it expected to collect. As mathema-
ticians, we can tell you that 65 per-
cent of 62percent is only 40percent
of students whose feedback was
recieved by the University.
When GSIs walk to the chalk-
board, we take responsibility for
the quality of education at the
University. Our students also take
responsibility by offering feedback
in office hours and through anon-
ymous evaluations. As another
semester begins, we hope that the
Office of Evaluations, the CTools
Implementation Group and the
provosts and deans will join us in
this responsibility and privilege
to better the education of the stu-
dents at the University.
Harlan Kadish and Kyle
Ormsby are members of the
Teaching Evaluations
Working Group.

p ennsylvania Sen. Arlen
Specter made headlines
last week when he formally
changed parties
and gave Demo-
crats a possible
filibuster-proof
majority. The
increase of the
number of Sen-
ate Democrats
to the magic -
60 (assuming MATTHEW
Al Franken of
Minnesota wins GREEN
the legal battle-
over his senate
seat) is no small thing. It will mean
a great deal for President Barack
Obama, Congressional Democrats
and indeed the rest of the country.
But of all the commentary on Sena-
tor Specter's political shift, I was
most affected by Avi Zenilman in
The New Yorker. Zenilman ended
his opinion piece (Three Quick
Thoughts on Specter's Defection,
04/28/2009) by pointing out that,
with Specter gone from the GOP,
"Eric Cantor -is the last Jewish
Republican in Congress."
The remark served more as a
light-hearted conclusion to Zenil-
man's piece than any real talking
point. But upon further consid-
eration, I realized the true sig-
nificance of that detail. First, it
highlights the fact that a large
majority of American Jews vote
Democrat. If Congressman Cantor
of Florida is the last Republican
out of the 45 Jews in Congress, 98
percent are Democrats or liberal
Independents. In addition, over 75
percent of Jews voted for Barack
Obama in 2008.
Seeing those inordinate num-
bers makes me wonder exactly
why this trend is so prevalent.

Some scholars point to the empha-
sis on peace and human rights
within Jewish thought, while oth-
ers offer an analysis of immigrant
history and urban proximity. Still
others look at Jewish involvement
in the labor movement. All of the
above are contributing reasons, to
be sure.
Yet, while each of the aforemen-
tioned points is relevant, the most
timely reason why Jews don't tend
to vote Republican is simply that
the GOP has become the myopic
party of rural America and the
Christian religious right. Having
spent one or two millennia on the
periphery of Christian society,
it's unsurprising that American
Jews generally feel uncomfort-
able voting for a party that defies
the mainstream and considers the
United States a Christian nation.
But Jewish distaste for the GOP
is only one example of for the over-
all nearsightedness of the party.
Apart from repelling religious
minorities, the Republicans have
similarly pushed away virtually
all racial minority groups, gays,
women and independents. Repub-
lican leaders have been preoccu-
pied for too long with pandering
to evangelists and so-called "real
Americans," promotingimpossible
standards for what it means to be
an American that they've failed
to reach. It shouldn't surprise the
GOP that they're losing elections,
considering how vastly they have
diminshed their own supportbase.
If Republicans want to regain
power, they'll have to become
more moderate and accepting of
all sorts of groups.
If Obama is successful in the
next few years, Democrats will
stay in power and push a center-
left agenda that will keep America

socially competitive with the rest
of the world during the ensuing
political era. But if the Democrats
fail to impress and the Republi-
cans have an opportunity for a
comeback, they'll have to return as
a hugely different party than they
were even four years ago. Perhaps
they'll be less xenophobic, perhaps
they'll be in favor of granting full
reproductive rights to women, or
perhaps they'll even see homosex-
nals as normal human beings.
To survive, the
GOP must be
more inclusive.
But in 2010, if Republicans do
not clean up their act, it is probable
that they will suffer even more
losses. Things are so bad for the
Grand Old Party that they lost a
historical member even during a
non-election year. Talk about neg-
ative momentum. But in a way, this
survival of the fittest is the sort of
capitalistic idea Republicans are
supposed to like. Democrats are
making more profits, so to speak,
because there's more of a demand
for what they have to offer. So now
it's the Republicans' chance to
change their business model and
steal some of the Democrats' busi-
ness. If they can't, then they will
have to quietly exit the market,
saying goodbye to their comeback.
But they'd probably ask for a
bailout before that happened.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The Daily is looking for a diverse
group of informed, hard-working
writers to join its Editorial Board.

Rachel Van Gilder at
rachelvg drumich.edu.

n a series entitled "Our
energy future" that ran from
Apr. 13 to Apr. 17, the Daily
covered a
variety of
emerging and
established
green energy
technologies
that will help
reduce harm-
ful emissions -
from power BEN
plants. WhileC
many of the CALECA
technologies
that harness
natural forces such as solar and
wind power have long histories of
extensive research in our coun-
try, such technologies are not
a panacea for all energy crises.
This is because of their depen-
dence on climate conditions and
high maintenance costs. The real
key is not only in expanding cur-
rent green energy sources, but
also investing in new avenues of
research for viable, universally
applicable clean energy.
Two months ago, the U.S.
Department of Energy announced
certification of the primary laser
at the National Ignition Facility,
located at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in Califor-
nia. The project sounds like some-
thing taken out of science fiction.
Using the world's largest laser, a
powerful beam of light is split into
192 separate beams and then refo-
cused onto a pea-sized amount of
hydrogen fuel. The hope is that
they can fuse these hydrogen
atoms into helium, and in turn
release massive amounts of clean
energy. But the real trick is mak-
ing such a system self-sustainable
so that it can produce continuous
energy for consumers to use.
Fusion reactors like the one
at NIF are a safe alternative to
reactors using radioactive fuel.
Fueling them would require only
hydrogen and its isotopes, which
can be readily extracted from
seawater. The reactors are not
limited by safety concerns like
nuclear plants, nor are they lim-
ited by the amount of sunlight or
wind a region gets at certain times,
counteringthe drawbacks of other
green energy sources. Even more
productive would be the use of
Helium-3, an isotope rarely found
on Earth but abundant in rocks on
the Moon. It could make the trip
to space economically viable.
As it stands right now, prac-
tical use of the process is a long
way off. First tests with the NIF
began two months ago. Full "igni-
tion" of the fusion reactor's fuel is
planned for sometime next year.
A project called the Interna-
tional Thermonuclear Experi-
mental Reactor, another type of
fusion reactor, uses magnets to
confine a fusion reaction. But this

type of reactor is still in develop-
ment. While it builds offof a long
historyof experimental data from
earlier magnetically confined
fusion experiments, this project
is a long way from starting its pri-
mary research goals.
If tests prove successful at
the NIF or the ITER, further
research would be required to
turn such a system into a viable
commercial system capable of
running efficiently. Economic
conditions make funding such
research nearly impossible in
the private sector because of the
billions of dollars required to lay
the groundwork for the science
behind a potential commercial
undertaking.
Fusion is the
future of enviro-
friendly energy.
Inevitably, such research
lies in the hands of government
agencies with an eye toward the
future. The federal stimulus plan
passed a few months ago included
significant governmental invest-
ments in solar, wind, and other
renewable energy technologies.
And here in Michigan, Governor
Jennifer Granholm has made the
green energy industry the cor-
nerstone of her plan to revamp
the failing economy. But research
on new technology with incred-
ible potential to power large
areas cheaply and cleanly - like
the NIF fusion reactor is a type
of energy investment the fed-
eral government has yet to make.
Investments like this would be
valuable to ensure the energy
security of the United States and
the rest of the world.
The increasing prominence
and funding of current renew-
able energy sources such as solar,
wind and nuclear power plants in
the quest for clean, oil-indepen-
dent power in the United States
and abroad is a positive sign of
change. But our country is miss-
ing the opportunity to expand
its energy portfolio in a way that
can keep pace with its exponen-
tially expanding energy demand.
The solutions to a greener future
do not lie in simply perfecting
established ideas. Instead, the
future of energy is in pioneering
new creations such as the NIF. To
make this future a reality, gov-
ernment and industry must invest
in researchers and inventors who
are dreaming of solutions most
people can hardly fathom.

CTools operations
teams are working
to identify the cause
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
AND LARA ZADE
Daily News Editors
In the midst of 'finishing proj-
ects and cramming for exams,
thousands of University students
became frustrated last Monday
night when CTools and the online
teaching evaluations shut down.
Though the technological error
occurred over a week ago, Uni-
versity officials still do not have
answers as to why or how it hap-
pened.
At last Monday's meeting of the
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs, John King, vice
provost for academic information,
said the University is investigating
swhat went wrong.
"There's a very major effortgoing
on right now to find out exactly
what caused this and that will obvi-
ously get fixed," King said.
King said he believes that the
CTools website was extremely
overloaded at the time of the crash,
and that the website couldn't han-
dle all of the functional tools that
were added to CTools over time.
"We have added so much func-
tionality, at the request of the units,
to both CTools and these other
things, that we got beyond our own
confidence in "our ability to test the
system at run time," he said.
King added that another factor
may have been the faculty's ability
to manage the website.
"Giving faculty members con-
trol of the teaching evaluation
apparatus - even relatively mod-
erate control - is part of the prob-
lem that can cloud the issues," he
said.
King indicated that in the future,
the University might have to imple-
ment new rules concerning.the fac-
ulty's power to monitor the site.
"Probably what we're going to
have to have is an agreed upon set
of protocols that people follow and
then an agreed upon behavior of
the system that stays with those
protocols," he said.
Professors received completed
teaching evaluations submitted
by students before 9 p.m. Apr. 20,

when the system crashed. Univer-
sity officials decided not to reopen
the teaching evaluations after
CTools was working again the next
morning.
King said some students would
have received their grades by then,
which could have influenced their
responses in the survey.
"From a policy perspective, the
issue of not collecting the evalua-
tions after grades have been posted
has been discussed, and it's under-
stood that's not anything anyone
intends to do," King said.
Despite the screw-up, officials
are confident the online evaluation
system first implemented last fall is
just as efficient as the paper evalua-
tion system.
Kingsaid the number of complet-
ed online evaluations in fall 2008
was similar to the amount filled out
on paper in fall 2007.
"In the fall term, evaluation
results were remarkably similar
to the fall of last year in terms of
the number of data collected and
in terms of what the evaluations
showed," he said.
Nonetheless, many students
were aggravated that they couldn't
evaluate the teaching styles and
performances of their professors
and GSIs this semester.
,LSA freshman Sara Schafrann
didn't have time to fill out the ques-
tionnaires before the system shut
down. She said she felt frustrated
about the situation because she
wanted to give positive feedback to
her favorite professors.
"I loved my sociology professor,
and I wish I could have given him a
good comment," she said.
LSA sophomore Kristen Krause
said she didn't get the chance to
express her disapproval of the way
her GSIs taught her classes.
"I was kind of upset we didn't
get to do them because I felt like I
couldn't give my constructive criti-
cism to some of my GSIs," she said.
Expressing her distrust of tech-
nology, Krause said she would have
rather filled out paper evaluations
like' the ones the University has
provided in the past.
The technological error not only
prevented students from critiquing
professors, but it negatively impact-
ed some students' grades.
LSA freshman Brittany Matson
lost four points in Biology 172 that
were given for filling out the evalu-

ations. She finished the survey
before the system crashed on Mon-
day but never e-mailed her GSI the
webpage confirming it.
"It will affect my grade because
I'm borderline between a C and B,"
Maston said.
Intermittent Astronomy Lectur-
er Philip Hughes said he was also
going to give students four extra
points on their final as an incentive
to complete the online evaluation.
"People see four free points,
and they can't resist getting them,"
Hughes said. "Now I'm going to
give four points to everybody - I
don't see any other alternative."
Professors interested in student
feedback devised their own ways
to obtain course evaluations. Some
handed out surveys after students
finished their finals while others
posted evaluations on separate
websites like those used by the
Department of Mathematics.
Communication III GSI Julia
Lippman created her own online
evaluation website and sentthe link
to her students in an e-mail.
"I got an additional third of my
students who responded because of
my replacement mechanism," she
said.
Lippman said evaluations are
crucial for improving her teaching
style and can determine a future
employer's hiring decision.
"When I go on the job market,
one of the things I have to show
employers is my teaching evalua-
tions," she said.
Lippman added thatshe now has
fewer evaluations to show employ-
ers because of the system failure.
She also said that she has seen a
definite decrease since last year in
the amount of students who fill out
the evaluations.
"Last semester I had approxi-
mately just over half of my stu-
dents respond, whereas in previous
semesters the response rate was
close to 100 percent," she said.
Although the online system
shutting down has caused prob-
lems for students and faculty
alike, Hughes said he doubts the
University will switch back to
paper evaluations.
"I can't imagine that the Uni-
versity would want to go back
to paper now," he said. "They've
adopted the online approach, and
they would invest any resource to
keep that up."

Officials plan ways
to protect students
from pandemic
By JASMINE ZHU
Daily NEWS EDITOR
With the H1N1 swine flu out-
break spreading to areas as close
as Livingston County, the Uni-
versity and the state of Michigan
are takingnecessary precautions
to protect students.
As of Apr. 29, the Centers for
Disease Control and Preven-
tion confirmed Michigan's first
case of swine flu in Livingston
County. A second case in Ottawa
County was confirmed a day
later.
The two confirmed cases are
part of a probable 47 cases of
swine flu in the state of Michi-
gan, according to Michigan offi-
cials.
As the flu spreads; state offi-
cials are recommending that
schools facing probable cases of
swine flu should be closed for a
week.
All 24 schools in the nearby
Plymouth-Canton district were
closed yesterday and today, due
to a suspected case of swine flu
from a 16-year old high school
student in the area.
On Apr. 28, University admin-
istrators met and decided that.
all three of the University's cam-
puses would not permit any Uni-
versity-sponsored programs to
travel to Mexico at this time.
Dr. Robert Winfield, chief
health officer of the Univer-
sity and director of the Univer-
sity Health Service, said that
all University programs bound
for Mexico have been cancelled,
including a University program
set to leave the first week of May
for Oaxaca, Mexico.
"We are strongly advising stu-
dents, as is the CDC, to not go to
Mexico at this time," Winfield
said.
According to the CDC, as of
yesterday there were 279 con-
firmed cases of swine flu infec-
tion within the United States,
including one death in Texas.
As of last Wednesday, the

World Health Organization has
classified swine flu as being in
Phase 5. Phase 5 and 6 represent
widespread human infection and
are classified as pandemics.
Winfield said that, theoreti-
cally, the University could cancel
programs in a high-risk situation
and bring students back home.
He said that the University
brought back three students in
China duringthe SARS epidemic
in 2003, which had a 60 percent
death rate.
But he added that, as of now,
the World Health Organization
is not advising any travel restric-
tions or closure of borders.
"We are past the tipping point
of containing the flu," he said.
There are currently three
University students in Mexico,
one of whom the University has
not been able to contact. The
other two have confirmed to the
University that they are doing
fine. None of the three students
are on a University-sponsored
program.
The incubation period for
swine flu is seven days, which
means that the students leaving
Mexico could still develop the
flu within a week.
"They could bring the disease
back, and it could be mild for
them, but it could be terrible for
someone else," Winfield said.
According to Winfield, the
guidelines cite that if a person
has returned from Mexico with-
in seven days and has an upper
respiratory infection, cough,
sore throat, runny nose, diar-
rhea, muscle aches or a fever
over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit,
he or she may have swine flu.
If a person suspects that he
or she has been infected with
swine flu, it is recommended
that the individual stays home
and avoids going out in public
areas. If the person is very sick,
then he or she should see a doc-
tor for an evaluation.
There is no timeline as to when
the University will reopen its
sponsored programs in Mexico.
The situation is being reviewed
on a weekly basis.
"The situation is very fluid
- it's changing literally by the
hour," Winfield said.

'Wolverine' Woes

Oberst's latest a
true team effort

The latest chapter
in the X-Men saga
disappoints with
lackluster effects
BY ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
Even by superhero movie stan-
dards - hell, even by "X-Men"
movie standards
- "X-Men Ori- '
gins: Wolverine"
looks remark- X-Men
ably fake. Take Origins:
aside the screen
saver-quality Wolverine
backgrounds for 20th

just focus on the Ctury Fo
claws. Logan, andShowcase
a.k.a. ol' Wolvie
(Hugh Jackman,
"Australia"), gazes at his claws
in wonderment numerous times
throughout the film, but there's
never any sense thatthree stainless
blades are actually protruding from
his knuckles. Instead, it just looks
like there are three animated lines
that the special-effects guys shined
up by pressing a button.
Believing that Wolverine's claws
are real should be a major factor in
audience enjoyment of a film based
entirely around his character; after
all, they're on the freaking promo
poster. But the fact that they're eas-
ily discernible in any given shot as
cartoonish computer effects is akin
to surgically removing the part of
a young man's brain that enjoys
comic books. Yes, of course they're
fake. But for the price of a movie
ticket, is it too much to ask for 107
minutes of being convinced they're
real? Apparently so.
The origins of Wolverine include
him discovering his mutation at an
early age, and the film's (admit-
tedly cool) opening credits show
him fighting in every major war
of the past century alongside his
brother, Victor (Liev Schreiber,
"Defiance"). The two of them plow
through unaged and unharmed
because of the healing powers that
come free with their mutations;
Victor's is similar to Logan's, only
with fast-growing nails instead
of claws. They are approached
by Lt. William Striker (Danny

up for good.

dissolution of
the Bright Eyes Outer South
moniker, and Merge
like his epony-
mous debut,
it works through a medium of
jammy border-rock that barely
resembles the precocious emo-
folk that defined his past.
But unlike 2008's Conor
Oberst, his newest effort is more
egalitarian, with "and the Mystic
Valley Band" now accompanying
"Conor Oberst" in your iTunes
library. And the album's cover
art features each musician's stoic
mug while Oberst stands in the
not-quite-center, unbalanced
and blindfolded. Could this be
some form of cryptic symbol-
ism?
Probably not. If anything,
it signifies Oberst handing the

wheel over to his backing band
- at least for a few miles. More
than any other Oberst record,
songwriting has become a com-
iunal effort. On Oberst, where
the Mystic Valley Band was more
of an incognito backing band,
Mr. Oberst wrote all but one
song. But now, the band mem-
bers are writing their own, and
even singing them, too. There
are six songs written by some-
one other than Oberst, and even
though the Oberst-penned and
-sung tunes are often the stron-
gest cuts here, tracks like drum-
mer Jason Boesel's "Difference
Is Time" and "Eagle On a Pole"
show off considerable songwrit-
ing talent themselves.

recruits them into a secret legion
of mutants doing misdeeds for a
mysterious higher purpose. Logan
disapproves of these actions and
leaves the group and his brother
behind.
The rest of the story focuses on
Logan's attempts to seek revenge
on his brother for attacking his
lover, which leads him back into the
hands of Stryker. An experiment is
performed on him to channel his
animal instincts and make him an
unstoppable killing machine. The
experiment is a rousing success,
but Stryker still decides he wants
Wolverine dead, which seems like
an awful waste of time and energy
on his part. It makes one wonder
exactly what Stryker was hoping to
accomplish with the experiment in
the first place.
Although we may not be able to
predict exactly where the story is
going, the film is obvious enough
about its twists that anyone pay-
ing the slightest attention can read
several scenes ahead at any given
moment. This is a problem for a
film that's far too dependent on plot
already. It's tough to rest emotion
on Wolverine's plight when we can
predict exactly where, under what
circumstances and whom he'll be
fighting in ten minutes.
Some diversion comes from
playing guess-that-mutant: Rec-
ognizable characters like Cyclops
and Wraith pop in for some effects

shots, then retreat before they can
contribute anything useful. All
of this only adds to the idea of a
mostly empty movie presented in
not-shiny-enough plastic wrap-
ping. It appears the filmmakers
couldn't put in the effort to create
an engaging, slightly unpredict-
able story with characters that
stick around. Everyone here's just
going through the superhero-mov-
ie motions.
There's still some fun to be
had, though. There's an engag-
ing, climactic showdown between
Wolverine and Weapon XI (Scott
Adkins, "The Bourne Ultimatum"),
a hybrid mutant with all the cool
powers implanted from every-
one else - he's like a bag of Chex
Mix that can kill people. The spe-
cial effects here still have a cheap,
glossy look to them, and there's
absolutely no substance to what's
happening, but by this point it's
quite clear the movie isn't going to
be the next "Iron Man," or even the
next "X-Men: The Last Stand," for
that matter. With mid-level expec-
tations dashed, all that's left is to
enjoy this one decently assembled
action scene.
With all due respect to Hugh
Jackman (who's still a fantastic
snarler and well worthy of anchor-
ing a decent action-movie fran-
chise), here's hopingthe guydoesn't
have to stare at his computerized
claws again in the near future.

record's air of liberation. There are
no rules on Outer South. Include a
synth-tinged pop song about having
sex on an airbed sung by the band's
guitaristtSure, call it "Air Matress."
How about an Oberst-only folk
tune that could've fit right in on
Bright Eyes's 2002 effort Lifted or
The Story is In the Soil? Yes sir, and
name it "White Shoes" and damn all
if it seems to contradict why Oberst
relinquished the Bright Eyes name
in the first place. The fun these guys
are having can be heard all over the
album, and it's undeniably conta-
gious.
Oberst himself has obviously
matured, not only in his songwrit-
ing but vocally as well. Gone (most-
ly) are the irritating faux-wavers
and the obvious cop-outs when he
can't quite reach a note. He's sing-
ing confidently, still idiosyncrati-
cally, but without all the immature
posturing heard on his earlier work
(much like the Bob Dylan voice that
emerged on Highway 61 Revisited).
As a younger lyricist, Oberst

focused more on writing one or two
clever lines per song than rolling
out a more linear, cohesive narra-
tive. When they hit, they hit hard.
But after a while, building songs
around one incisive phrase becomes
lazy and ineffectual. It seems
Oberst has either grown out of that
phase or just learned to curb it,
because Outer South contains some
of his most unfrilled lyrics yet. This
doesn't mean they lack the poetics of
the past - there's still beauty in the
bare. Songs like "Cabbage Town"
and "Air Mattress" are straightfor-
ward odes to love on the road and
capture the feeling impeccably.
The most allegorical song on the
album, "Roosevelt Room," is a Yeat-
sian vision of an America in flames.
With lyrics like "And I'd like to write
my congressman / But I can't afford
the stamp," it's the album's only bla-
tantly political tune. It feels mostly
out of place on the record, but it's still
a hell of a protest song.
Outer South may or may not be
the definitive sound of the new
Conor Oberst (my money's on not),
but its definitely a worthy genre
diversion from a group of talented
musicians.

Chatting with Kirk and Spock

By HANS YADAV
Daily Arts Writer
Everyone loves a good "roots"
movie - the story behind the
story. Films like "Batman
Begins" take viewers to the ear-
liest, most pivotal moments in
the lives of some of film's iconic
figures. These films elucidate
the mystery surrounding the
characters and their actions.
With the new film "Star Trek,"
audiences will finally be able
to see the beginnings of argu-
ably the two most recognized
names in science fiction: Cap-
tain James T. Kirk
and Spock.
In the "Star
Trek"
TV show,
Captain
Kirk and
Spock were
the com-
manders.

vastly differing personalities an
their underlying rivalry forged
friendship that was much of wh

memorable one. In the new movi
the teenage Kirk is played by Chr

deeply felt emotions: passion,
fear, anger. The core struggle
for me was containing all of that
- containing all this deeply felt
stuff and not really being able to
express it so humanly. It was a
really fascinating challenge."
Because the two men's fates
intertwine on one galactic space-
ship, Kirk and Spock obviously
butt heads when it comes to the
matter of how to tackle a prob-
lem. The dynamic between Kirk
and Spock is helped by the fact
that Pine and Quinto knew each
other beforehand. They grew up
in the same L.A. neighborhood.
Much of the focus of "Star
Trek" is establishing the relation-
ship between Kirk and Spock. If
the movie can at least success-
fully translate their quirky-yet-
resolute friendship from the TV
series to the big-screen, "Star
Trek" is bound for fame and a
direction no movie has gone

THREET SPEAKS
Daily Sports Writer Joe Stapleton sits down in an exclusive
interview with the soon-to-be Sun Devil QB Steven Threet

Stapleton: Why Arizona State?
Threet: The first thing I looked
at for any school I was going to go
to was the offense they run and the
coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel
it fits me offensively with the type
of offense they run, it's a pro-style
offense. I get along very well with
the coaching staff, I feel like they
will be able to help me get better
every day in practice and through-
out the season and help me devel-
op.
S: A lot ofpeople look at the situa-
tion you had at Michigan, with a good
chance you'd enter the season as the
starter. What don't they know that
made it not that favorable for you?
T: If you really look at the situa-
tion I was in, it really doesn't fit me.
My friend likes to say it's like com-
ing to Michigan to go to be a doctor,
and then they get rid of the Medical
school, you knowySo it's disappoint-
ing to me because I love Michigan,
I've said thatbefore, I grew up a fan
of Michigan, but it's a situation now
where I have to try to do what's best
for me. That's the situation I'm in,
and now I love Arizona State, too.
S: How important is the system
you're playing in to the success of a
quarterback?
T: I think it's more important
for the quarterback than any other
position. I have a specific skill set
as a quarterback, and that skill set
doesn't match up with the offense at
Michigan. I don't want to overstate
it, because I ran the offense - some
would say not very well - but ulti-
mately it comes down to wins and
losses. ButI think alot of times peo-
ple overlook certain things. Michi-
gan fans were used to Chad Henne
as a junior and a senior, and not too
many people were thinking about
how he did in his freshman year, or

John Navarre's freshman year. It
comes down to wins and losses, but
you have to put it in perspective.
S: How bigofa role did all the crit-
icism of last year play in your deci-
sion to leave?
T: None at all, to be honest with
you. During the season, and even
now, I don't really read the news-
papers, and I don't read the blogs,
because even if there are people
saying positive things you can't
only listen to them and block out
the people saying negative things.
I'm my own harshest critic anyway.
S: There was one quote that stood
out for me from last season. It was
after the Michigan State game when
Michigan's offensive coordinator
Calvin McGee described your play as
"inconsistent, as always."
T: I guess I feel like that's a dif-
ference of philosophy from the
previous staff. Granted, coaches do
different things to get the most out
of their players. Some people close
to me were upset that a coach would
call me out in front of the media, but
you know, in the end it didn't really
matter to me. And to be honest, my
play in the Michigan State game
was inconsistent. Is it right to say
that at the press conference after
the game? I mean, we had just lost
a big rivalry game, so I would chalk
most of that up to emotions after a
big game like that.
S: What do the coaches at Arizona
State provide that Rich Rodriguez
and his staffdon't?
T: It's mostly the difference in
the offense. The offense here is
pretty much set in stone, while
Coach Erickson and Coach Olsen
have been in the pros, they run a
pro system, and it's just a difference
in offensive philosophy.
S: So it's strictly a difference in

offensive philosophy, not in dealing
with players?
T: They could deal with players
differently, but like I said, every
coach has a different way of trying
to get the most out of their players.
But I wasn't switching because the
coaches were too hard on me, or
anything like that. It wasn't a situ-
ation where I hate getting yelled at
or anything. I mean, I'm a football
player.
S: You're the latest in a pretty long
line of guys who came to play for
Lloyd Carr and left when Rich Rodri-
guez came. Why do players leave?
T: I don't know. I think when
they came, they knew what they
were getting, the system was in
place, and so was the coaching staff.
I mean, Michigan, before Coach
Rodriguez, had had the same basic
offensive philosophy and group of
coaches for 30-some years. I know
(former offensive lineman) Justin
(Boren) left because he felt that it
wasn't Michigan anymore, at least
not the same Michigan.
S: In this system, had you stayed,
do you think you would have been
able to keep the starting job the rest
ofyour career?
T: With the way they run the
offense, no. But, it's tough to say. I
know a lot of people say, you know,
"Oh, he saw the writing on the wall,
with the freshman quarterback
coming in," but that's not it. It's not
that I couldn't be successful ina sys-
tem like this, I just think it's better
for me to be ina different system.
S: So you're giving up a starting
job just to be in a system you think
fits your skills?
T: It is the single most important
thingfor a quarterback. It's why you
don't see a 5-foot-9 kid who's really
fast running the style of offense

that we had here a year
ago. So people say, "you
come to the school for
Michigan." Yeah, but
at the same time, can
you imagine any of the
guys who came before
me - Chad (Henne),
Tom Brady, Brian Gri-
ese, Navarre - can you
imagine any of them
runningthis offense? It
wouldn't happen.
S: What do you
think when people
say you're transfer-
ring because you're
scared of the compe-
tition? -o

'M' finds a win after a no-hit affair

By RYAN KARTJE
ManagingSports Editor
The bases were loaded in the
sixth inning of Saturday's first
game at Bill Davis Stadium in
Columbus. Ohio State designated
hitter Ryan Dew came to the plate
against Michigan senior pitcher
Chris Fetter, who had been firmly
entrenched in a pitcher's duel with
Buckeye pitcher Alex Wimmers

until that point.
Dew launched Fetter's fastball
straight up behind home plate, but
junior catcher Chris Berset lost it in
the bright sun, and Dew took Fet-
ter's next pitch into the outfield for
two runs.
The hit was all the momentum
Wimmers needed to shutdown the
Wolverines in no-hit fashion, 6-0.
It was the first time Michigan
(7-11 Big Ten, 24-21 overall) has

gone without a pitch 27 years, with
Ohio State (13-5, 34-11) dealing the
Wolverines' National Pitcher of the
Year candidate his second loss of
the season.
"You never want to be no-hit;"
Berset said. "It's discouraging. But
what's most disappointing about it
is Chris Fetter not being able to get
the win he deserves."

But even with the Wolverines'
individual successes, the middle
two rounds kept Michigan from
gathering steam and having a
successful weekend after their
impressive entrance into the tour-

NO-HITTER
From page 11
of scoreless work, Wimmers and
Fetter - two of the Big Ten's
best pitchers - accounted for 14
strikeouts. But after Dew's hit,
Fetter fell apart as he allowed
four runs in the sixth and sev-
enth innings.
Fetter's performance in the
first game of a series often serves
as the measuring stick for the rest
of the Wolverines' weekend. And
it's no secret that the team counts
on Fetter for a win.
"It's huge to go 1-0 on a team,"
said sophomore centerfielder'
Ryan LaMarre. "If you get that
first one under your belt, you're
one win away from winning the
series. We know (Fetter) always
gives us a chance, and that's
important to our success."
After Fetter was dealt a loss in
Saturday's first game, the Wol-
verines were hard-pressed to
bounce back in the nightcap.
Michigan came out firing with
two quick runs, but sophomore
pitcher Tyler Burgoon fell vic-
tim to a six-run hitting spree that
shortened his campaign to just

Despite a comeback attempt
in the game's middle innings,
the Wolverines lack of consistent
pitching doomed them to a 9-6
loss.
"We were a few bounces from
being in the first and second
games," LaMarre said. "(Sun-
day's

game.
We all MICHIGAN 9

knew it,
so we

tion."
Apparently, desperation was
what Michigan needed in the
final game of the series as it cou-
pled a consistent effort on the
mound from junior Eric Katz-
man, who allowed just four hits
and one earned run, with solid
play at the plate as four Wolver-
ines got multiple hits leading to
a 9-2 win.
By salvaging a win in Sun-
day's game, the Wolverines kept
within a half-game of Purdue,
which holds the sixth spot in the
Big Ten standings after winning
two games against Indiana this
weekend.
Only the top six teams make
the conference tournament, so if
Michigan hopes to compete for
the Big Ten Championship, it'll
have to be one step ahead of the
Boilermakers in the two remain-
ing weekends of the conference
season.
"We've had three straight Big
Ten championships," LaMarre
said. "No one is feeling sorry for
us where we are."
But Michigan coach Rich
Maloney knows the Wolverines'
postseason position depends on
what happens in the next two
weeks and whether Michigan
can pull together the complete,
consistent effort it has strived
for all season.
"We know we can beat any-
body, win any day, but because
of our inconsistency, we haven't
been able to," Maloney said.
"The Tournament, for us, is far
out there. The biggest thing for
us is to be a better team, get in
that six spot, and perhaps play
our best baseball at that time."
