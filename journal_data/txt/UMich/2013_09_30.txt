Presidential Search
Advisory Committee
finishes series of
public forums
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
The University's Board of
Regents and members of the
Presidential Search Advisory
Committee rounded out a series
of public forums Friday, holding
one at the University of Michi-
gan, Dearborn campus and one
for the general public in Ann
Arbor.
Regent Julia Darlow (D),
Regent Katherine White (D) and
Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, dean
of the School of Information,
were present for both forums,
and Regent Denise Ilitch (D)

was present at the Dearborn
forum. Search consultant Alison
Ranney from Russell Reynolds
Associates, the firm hired by the
regents to assist in determining
qualified and interested candi-
dates, was also present.
White, vice chair of the Board
of Regents and acting spokes-
woman for the regents during
the search process, began each
meeting by explaining the pur-
pose of the forums: to give the
Presidential Search Advisory
Committee a better idea of the
opportunities and challenges
facing the University, as well
as what qualities constituents
would like to see in the next Uni-
versity president.
The recurring theme dur-
ing the Dearborn forum was
increased access to the resources
and attention that the Ann Arbor
campus receives. Many faculty

Intoxicated man
attempts to steal
pizza-delivery car
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
Pizza delivery has never been
so dramatic.
Sunday evening at about 7

p.m., a man attempted to steal
the vehicle of a Cottage Inn
Pizza delivery driver on the 700
block of Packard Street, just east
of the State Street intersection.
Just seconds after the vehicle
was stolen, the suspect allegedly
caused a collision, which result-
ed in his arrest.
The suspect - who Ann
Arbor Police say was under
the influence of drugs - stole

the vehicle that had been left
unlocked outside of an apart-
ment complex during a delivery.
After taking the vehicle, the sus-
pect collided with an oncoming
vehicle traveling east on Pack-
ard Street. That vehicle, a Jeep
Wrangler, was carrying two
passengers, who both left the
scene uninjured.
The delivery driver, Bryan,
who asked to be identified by his

first name only, said the suspect
"looked like a kid behind the
wheel for the first time." The
suspect pulled onto Packard at a
high rate of speed and drove in
an erratic fashion, Bryan said.
He added that the man seemed
to be driving on the wrong side
of the road.
Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Amy
Metzer confirmed the suspect

also dealt with the failure of the

Father of attacked
Dodgers fan calls
for witnesses
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
father of a Los Angeles Dodgers
fan stabbed to death after a San
Francisco Giants game last week
asked Sunday for witnesses who
may have captured the fight on
mobile devices to come forward
and help both families find clo-
sure.
Robert Preece, his voice qua-
vering at times, spoke in front of
AT&T Park's iconic Willie Mays
statue before the Giants played
the San Diego Padres. He was
flanked by family members who
handed out fliers to fans stream-
ing into the stadium.
The fight Wednesday night
ended with the death of his
24-year-old son, Jonathan Denver.

"Losing a child is a heart-
ache no parent should have to
endure," Preece said in his plea
for witnesses to the fight, which
resulted in the arrest of Michael
Montgomery, 21. Montgomery
was released from jail on Friday
after the district attorney said
police have not yet collected
enough evidence to warrant
criminal charges. Montgomery's
father has told other media out-
lets that his son says Denver hit
him over the head with a chair
and he stabbed him in self-
defense.
Preece said Sunday that he
saw bystanders with mobile
devices and believes they were
recording the incident.
"The Montgomery family is
likely suffering as well," Preece
said. "I am making a plea to the
public asking that anyone who
may have witnessed the inci-
dent to come forth so that both

families can have some measure
of closure. I believe that some-
one may have videotaped the
incident so we can discover the
truth."
Denver's mother, Diana Den-
ver, said in a prepared statement
that she was angered by Mont-
gomery's release and what she
called "the negligence of our jus-
tice system."
The victim's aunt, Jill Haro
Preece read the mother's state-
ment after Diana Denver said
she was too emotional to address
the dozen of cameras and report-
ers assembled in front of Mays'
statue.
San Francisco District Attor-
ney George Gascon said police
had not spoken with any inde-
pendent witnesses who may
have witnessed the fight, which
is what prompted Preece and
his family to make their public
plea.

Build nascent
insurance markets
withinjurisdiction
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - With
new online health insurance
exchanges set to launch Tuesday,
consumers in many Southern and
Plains states will have to look
harder for information on how
the marketplaces work than their
counterparts elsewhere.
In Republican-led states
that oppose the federal Afford-
able Care Act, the strategy has
ranged from largely ignoring the
health overhaul to encouraging
residents not to sign up and even
making it harder for nonprofit
organizations to provide infor-
mation about the exchanges.
Health care experts worry that
ultimately consumers in these
states could end up confused
about the exchanges, and the
overall rollout of the law could be
hindered.
"Without the shared planning
and the cooperation of the state
government, it's much harder
for them to be ready to imple-
ment this complicated law," said
Rachel Grob of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, who has
studied differences in how states
are implementing segments of
the law.
Several of the 14 Northeast,
Midwest and Western states
running their own insurance
exchanges have spent weeks on
marketing and advertising cam-

paigns to help residents get ready
to buy health insurance. At least
$684 million will be spent on
publicity explaining what people
need to do next and persuading
the doubtful to sign up for cover-
age, according to data compiled
The Associated Press.
By contrast, most states across
the South have declined federal
grants to advertise the exchanges
and ceded the right to run the
marketplaces themselves. And
early Sunday, the Republican-led
U.S. House added to legislation
that would avert a partial govern-
ment shutdown a one-year delay
of the creation of the marketplac-
es. Democrats have said delaying
the health care law would sink
the bill, and the White House
promised aveto.
Governors from the Caroli-
nas to Kansas have decried the
exchanges and the rest of the law,
which was passed by Congress in
2010 and many argue reaffirmed
when voters re-elected President
Obama in 2012. The Supreme
Court in 2012 upheld the consti-
tutionality of most of the law; a
piece of the Medicaid expansion
was an exception.
"When it came to Obamacare,
we didn't just say 'no,' we said
'never,"' South Carolina Gov.
Nikki Haley said. last month
alongside U.S. Sen. Tim Scott,
whom she appointed last Decem-
ber when Jim DeMint resigned.
"And we're going to keep on fight-
ing until we get people like Sen.
Scott and everybody else in Con-
gress to defund Obamacare."

Priority to
prevent ability
to manufacture
chemical arms
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - Inspectors who will
oversee Syria's destruction of its
chemical weapons said Sunday
their first priority is to help the
country scrap its ability to man-
ufacture such arms by a Nov. 1
deadline - using every means
possible.
The chemical weapons
inspectors said that may
include smashing mixing
equipment with sledgeham-
mers, blowing up delivery
missiles, driving tanks over
empty shells or filling them
with concrete, and running
machines without lubricant
so they seize up and become
inoperable.
On Friday, the U.N. Security
Council ordered the Organi-
zation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons to help Syria
destroyits chemical weapons by
mid-2014.

On Sunday, inspectors met
with media in The Hague to
explain their current plan of
action, which is to include an
initial group of 20 leaving for
Syria on Monday.
The organization allowed
two inspectors to speak on
condition of anonymity out
of concern for their safety
amid Syria's civil war; both
are veteran members of the
OPCW. Spokesman Michael
Luhan said the men "are
going to be deeply involved

been done before: an inter-
national mission to go into a
country which is involved in a
state of conflict and amid that
conflict oversee the destruc-
tion of an entire category of
weapons of mass destruction
which it possesses," Luhan
said. "This is definitely a his-
torical first."
Syria acknowledged for the
first time ithas chemical weap-
ons after an Aug. 21 poison gas
attack killed hundreds of civil-
ians in a Damascus suburb
and President Barack Obama

threatened a military strike in
retaliation. A U.N. investiga-
tion found that nerve gas was
used in the attack but stopped
short of blaming it on Syr-
ian President Bashar Assad's
regime.
After a flurry of diplomatic
negotiations involving the U.S.,
Syria, and Syrian ally Russia,
Syria made an initial volun-
tary disclosure of its program
to the Hague-based OPCW.
Under organization's rules, the
amounts and types of weap-
ons in Syria's stockpiles, and
the number and location of the
sites, will not be publicly dis-
closed.
The U.S. and Russia agree
that Syria has roughly 1,000
metric tons of chemical
weapons agents and precur-
sors, including blister agents
such as sulfur and mustard
gas, and nerve agents like
sarin. External experts say
they are distributed over 50
to70 sites.
One of the OPCW experts
with a military background said
the "open source" information
about the Syrian program is
"reasonable."

Radio failures cited in the
deaths of 19 Ariz. firemen

Experts seek policy
changes, more
investigation in
response to attack
PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) -
Shortly before 19 elite firefight-
ers perished in a ragingArizona
wildfire, commanders thought
the crew was ina safe place. No
one had heard from the Granite
Mountain Hotshots for 33 min-
utes. The crew didn't contact
commanders, and commanders
didn't radio them.
Then it was too late.
A three-month investiga-
tion into the June 30 deaths
released Saturday did not
determine if the tragedy was
avoidable, while outlining a
series of missteps by the crew
and commanders and reveal-
ing the more than half-hour
of radio silence that occurred
justbefore the firefighters were
overwhelmed by flames.
It's not certain why the crew
left what was believed to be
a safe spot on a ridge that the
fire had previously burned and,
apparently seeking another safe
location, unknowingly walked
to their deaths in a basin thick
with dry brush. At the time
they died, an airtanker was cir-
cling overhead, confused about
their location.
"There is much that can-
not be known about the crew's
decisions and actions" because
of the gap in communications,
the report concluded.
The 120-page report by a
team of local, state and federal
fire experts pointed to repeat-
ed problems with radios and
contact with the crew. At one
point, a pilot wanted to check
on the firefighters after hearing
radio traffic that they might be
on the move, but commanders
believed at that time the crew
was positioned safely.
Ted Putnam, a former inves-
tigator for the U.S. Forest Ser-
vice, said the report didn't go
far enough to dissect the deci-

sions made by the firefighters.
When the crew members went
silent and did not notify anyone
they were changing locations
"there's an active failure there,"
he said.
At a news conference in
Prescott, where the fallen fire-
fighters lived, Shari Turby-
fill implored officials to draw
stronger conclusions about why
her stepson and his fellow fire-
fighters died, and recommend
immediate changes.
"I don't want another family
to deal with this," she said.
Her husband, David, said the
emergency fire shelter in which
his 27-year-old son Travis died
had not been improved in 13
years.
"Policies, as they may be,
need to change," he said.
Despite identifying numer-
ous problems, the report found
that proper procedure was fol-
lowed in the worst firefighting
tragedy since Sept. 11, 2001.
Investigators suggested that
the state of Arizona should pos-
sibly update its guidelines and
look into better tracking tech-
nology.
All but one member of the
Granite Mountain Hotshots
crew died while protecting
the small former gold rush
town of Yarnell, about 80 miles
northwest of Phoenix, from an
erratic, lightning-sparked fire.
Hotshots are elite backcountry
firefighters who hike deep into
the brush to fight blazes.
Investigators described what
became a chaotic day in which a
fire that two days earlier caused
little concern bloomed into an
inferno that incinerated pine,
juniper and scrub oak in an
area that hadn't experienced a
significant wildfire in nearly a
half century.
The day went according to
routine in the boulder-strewn
mountains until the wind shift-
ed around 4 p.m., pushing a
wall of fire that had been reced-
ing from the firefighters all day
back toward them. The report
suggested the crew was blind-
sided when the fire changed

direction and surged in inten-
sity and speed.
Commanders did not find
out the men were surrounded
by flames and fighting for their
lives until five minutes before
they deployed their emergen-
cy shelters, which was more
than a half hour after a stormy
weather warning was issued.
Without guidance from the
command center or their look-
out, who had escaped after
warning the crew, the men
bushwhacked into a canyon
that soon turned into a bowl of
fire. The topography whipped
up 70-foot flames that bent
parallel and licked the ground,
producing 2,000 degree heat.
Fire shelters, always a dreaded
last resort, start to melt at 1,200
degrees.
The report confirms the
crew knew about the changing
weather, and just before 4 p.m.
a commander warns the crew
superintendent to "hunker and
be safe."
There was no word from
the crew from just after 4 p.m.
until just minutes before the fire
overwhelms them - a gap of 33
minutes.
Shortly before they deploy
their shelters, a static-filled
transmission comes over an
air-to-ground frequency from a
crew member at 4:39 p.m.: "We
are in front of the flaming front."
Other firefighters working
on the blaze who pick up the
transmission are confused,
hearing the urgency in the
Hotshot's voice and chain saws
roaring in the background.
They believed the crew was in
a safe spot.
In final snippets of conversa-
tion, the crew superintendent
says urgently "our escape route
has been cut off. We are prepar-
ing a deployment site" for the
shelters.
He's assured an airtanker is
coming.
But a smaller plane makes
seven passes over four minutes
trying to locate the crew to
guide the bigtanker, but cannot
find or contact them.

One successful nerd?
Snyder should stand up against the Tea Party for moderate values
Although Gov. Rick Snyder hasn't officially announced his re-
election bid for 2014, his campaign machine has begun saturat-
ing the airwaves with a new slogan "One Successful Nerd," an
update of his original "One Tough Nerd" motto. While the slogan fits a
nice narrative, "successful" may be a bit presumptuous. Through tough
budgeting and some controversial decisions, Michigan's operating deficit
is gone and the economy is on the mend. Snyder has put in much effort
to attract businesses to the state of Michigan - some would argue quite
successfully. However, Snyder can only claim success if his administra-
tion stands up for moderate values and sound policy against the state's

This semester I'm taking a
strategy class in the Busi-
ness school called "The
Corporation in
Society." The
course debates
the purpose of
the modern-day
corporation and
ponders if it has
an obligation to
fulfill a social HARSHA
purpose. But, on
the first day of NAHATA
class we started
thinking about
the purpose of a university educa-
tion and whether that purpose is
being served to its maximum. And
that's a discussion that isn't had
enough.
In 1907, psychologist William
James delivered an address at Rad-
cliffe College titled "The Social
value of the College-Bred." It's
amazing to see that central themes
and questions posed in this address
are still relevant. James draws a dis-
tinction between a technical school
education and liberal-arts universi-
ties. He points out that a university
education is a way to gain a broader
understanding of the world and a
place to exercise your thinking in a
way that's different than perfecting
a specific skill.
Yet, university education is
increasingly becoming special-
ized and skill-oriented. From the
start there's pressure to focus on a
particular area and excel at build-
ing tangible workplace skill sets
in a particular department. With
pre-professional tracks and com-
bined masters/bachelors programs,
sometimes incoming freshman

Unstuck
already have the next four years
mapped out. But looking back at
my university experience, it's the
uncertainty and ability to experi-
ment that has contributed to my
growth the most.
I remember when I started col-
lege three years ago: I came in
with a clear idea of how I thought
it would be. I knew what organiza-
tions I wanted to join and what I
wanted to study. I was going to be
best friends with my roommate.
Everyone I talked to told me college
was going to be the best four years
of my life, and coming in I thought
I knew exactly what to do to make
sure that was the case.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
College has still been the best
years of my life, but in a complete-
ly unexpected
way. From orga-
nizations I'm a .
part of, to the Losing o
major I've cho- now and
sen, I'm learn-
ing about things broader
that I didn't
even know education
existed four
years ago, much
less was interested in. My passions,
interests and goals have all evolved,
and I know they will continue to.
And each step of the way has been
a huge learning experience - even
things that I thought were com-
pletely irrelevant at the time have
played a central role in getting me
to the point I'm at now.
In fact, I only wish I had come
in with less of a plan, and had
allowed myself even more free-
dom to explore. This past sum-
mer, I watched one of Educational

Theatre Company's productions at
freshman orientation. Watching
that performance as a rising senior
gave me a different perspective.
There isa part in the play that men-
tions that, inevitably, at some point
everyone coming into college will
find themselves "stuck" - stuck
to old habits, friends, comfortable
things. And to fully appreciate
one's college experience one has to
become "unstuck."
It took me until senior year to
realize how stuck I had been. And
I only wish I had seen that sooner.
One of my favorite quotes says:
"Life begins at the edge of your
comfort zone." I knew this, and
coming into college I fully planned
to embody this, and, yet, soon found
myself unconsciously slipping back
into my comfort
zone.
The thing is,
cus every sometimes even
then has once you real-
ize that you're
ned mys stuck, becoming
unstuck is the
al outlook. hard part. It's
hard because it's
so much easier
to stay in your comfort zone. It's
natural. So often you find yourself
falling into it even when you didn't
know you were. But slowly ventur-
ing out beyond that comfort has
led to some of the most formative
experiences I've had. And when I
look back, I can pinpoint the way in
which losing focus every now and
then has broadened my educational
outlook.

Tea Party-dominated legislature.
Despite announcing that Michigan's edu-
cational system "does not work" at an educa-
tional summit in April, state government has
done more to enhance problems for higher
education than to fix them. Since Snyder has
been in office, funding for public universities
has decreased by 11.35 percent, spurring fur-
ther privatization of supposedly public insti-
tutions and driving up tuition. Michigan's
lack of commitment to education is an embar-
rassment, and Snyder should use his bully pul-
pit to reprioritize it in Lansing.
Furthermore, Snyder has done little to
attract students to stay in Michigan after
graduation from any of the state's colleges.
Michigan invests in students and degrees only
to have graduates leave and take their talent
elsewhere. Providing incentives to companies
that hire young people would entice quali-
fied students to stay in state after graduation.
Improving public transit between Detroit and
other Michigan cities, creating a student-loan
forgiveness program and properly implement-
ing the Affordable Care Act are only a few pol-
icies that could help prevent brain drain.
Several of the largest failures of Snyder's
first term stem from the comically conserva-

tive Republicans in the state legislature, and
the governor's inability to keep that caucus
under control. The controversial right-to-
work legislation passed despite Snyder's
insistence that it was not a priority policy for
his administration. It's difficult to keep young
people in the state with restrictive abor-
tion laws and policies that are hostile to the
LGBTQ community. Some of these laws being
pushed through the lame-duck legislature
make Snyder appear aloof and outgunned by
his more conservative GOP peers. The gover-
nor should clarify his social views, and abide
by his campaign promise to be socially lib-
eral. Whether those views conflict with the
far right of his party, Snyder should stay true
to his campaign promises and push for more
moderate social legislation.
Snyder has a lot of work to do if he wants
the support of students in the upcoming elec-
tion, first by standing up to the Tea Party
ideologues in Lansing. More funding for
higher education, incentives for companies
that hire recent graduates, improved infra-
structure and more moderate social views
can help the governor go from "nerd" to "suc-
cessful nerd."

MARION BERGER I
Say 'no more' to generalizations

On a sunny football Saturday about two
weeks ago, I was walking down East Univer-
sity Avenue with a few friends when I decided
to share an amusing fact I had realized earlier
that day: the only maize and blue shirt I had
was one that read: "I love girls that love girls."
My friends and I laughed, buta male student
sitting at a table on the street overheard our
conversation and chose to yell at me, "Hey,
me too! Hey, are you tryingto lez out?" My
friends, being as great as they are, responded
with some choice words, and a sarcastic "Oh,
I'm so happy we live in such a'progressive'
town." Problem solved, right? Not quite.
I don't think I can accurately describe the
anger this stirred in me. To rewind a little
bit, I think I need to explain that I only very
recently became comfortable with my sexuali-
ty. Nine years of Catholic school plus a lifetime
of sexual/sexuality conservatism in my broad-
er families, precipitated by a hetero-normative
and homophobic culture, left me suppressing
my feelings for women for 19 long years of my
life. It wasn't until I moved into a co-op last
year that I started to come to terms with the
fact that I had always been queer, whether
willing to admit it to myself or not.
Over the past 10 months or so, I've gone
through an incredible transformation. I now
feel that I have not only "come to terms"
with my sexuality, but I actively celebrate it.
Years of suppression morphed into pride and
a comfort with myself that I never imagined
I could experience. Sometimes I want to
scream from the rooftops: "I'm a woman who
loves women!" Because I really do, and I've
never felt so proud of it.
Fast-forward to that day on the street
wherein my fellow student asked me if I was
"tryingto lez out." This language represents
a male-dominated culture that fetishizes les-
bian identities. Let me just say this to the male
population at Michigan once: Lesbians are not
here to serve your fantasies. In fact, we, and
all women and people, are not here to serve
your anything. We want nothing to do with
you sexually. And, please, don't even get me
started on the confusion around bisexuality
- if a woman likes both men and women, her/
ze's/their relationships with women still have
nothing to do with you.
This situation has been eating away at me

ever since it happened. What bothers me
most about this language is that the Univer-
sity and Ann Arbor at large claim to be hubs
of progressive ideologies, and, at the very
least, claim to be accepting of all identities.
However, I feel uncomfortable every time a
class, club or meetingstarts without asking
people their preferred gender pronouns. For
the record, though I disagree with the gender
binary in general, I'm lucky enough to feel
comfortable with the sex identity I was born
into. But what about my transgender, gender-
queer, etc. peers? I feel uncomfortable wear-
ing my "LGBTQ" pride shirt to class and club
meetings for fear that another club member
or professor is homophobic. I feel uncomfort-
able with the large portion of Greek life on
our campus that reinforces a heteronorma-
tive, and often patriarchal, society. To be fair,
I don't mean to blanket all of Greek life with
generalizations. I merely mean to say that the
system is based on antiquated understandings
of sexuality and gender.
In a country that appears to have made
great strides forward in the acceptance of
queer identities, represented by the more than
50 percent of Americans who support same-
sex marriage, I'm sad to say that I still feel
uncomfortable and exiled on Michigan's cam-
pus. Perhaps this is indicative of the nature of
the argument for same-sex marriage: that it
emphasizes tolerance and acceptance over a
real understanding of the harmfulness of all
binaries.
I have to say that I'm unbelievably lucky
to live in the co-op I do, where it's explicit
that feeling comfortable to be oneself with-
out judgment or harassment is the norm.
For those who don't have this privilege - all
my fellow LGBTQI/A-Z individuals on this
campus struggling every day - I'm with you.
Pride isstill our parade, so come yell from the
rooftops with me sometime. It's only through
pride and solidarity that we have a chance
of moving forward together. In my last two
years here, I'm making it my point to say "no
more" to this kind of behavior and thinking on
our campus. Nineteen years is a longtime to
refuse your own identity. Join me in spending
the next 60 years defending it.

Thank you, Ted Cruz. After
the Texas senator's epic,
21-hour floor speech Tues-
day in which
he advocated
defunding the
Affordable
Care Act, I have
nothing to say
but thank you.
(Side note:
we don't call PATRICK
Social SecurityPA IC
Roosevelt-Care MAILLET
or Medicare
Johnson-Care.
The bill has a name, and it's the
Affordable Care Act.)
Although a thank you is in order
simply because Cruz further exem-
plified just how comically divided
and reckless the Republican Party is
with his 21-hour rant, my gratitude
is for something Cruz said during
his speech.
At 8 p.m., approximately five
hours into his remarks, Cruz began
reading Dr. Seuss's "Green Eggs and
Ham". Although Cruz made the bold
claim that his father had invented the
colorful dish three hours prior in his
speech, the main reason he read the
story was for his two young daugh-
ters watching back home in Texas.
For those unfamiliar with the
story, "Green Eggs and Ham" is the
tale of a man who refuses to eat green
eggs and ham even though the char-
acter "Sam-I-Am" relentlessly thinks
of odd scenarios in which the man
could possibly eat the dish. Eventu-
ally, in an effort to get Sam-I-Am to
leave him alone, the man finally tries
a bite and realizes that he actually
loves it.
At the end of the dramatized read-
ing, Cruz asserted that there may be
some similarities between this clas-
sic children's story and the ACA. As
Cruz explained, "They did not like
Obamacare in a box with a fox, in a
house or with a mouse." His point
was that no matter where or how you
implement the contentious 2010 leg-
islation, America will not like it.
One would assume that some-
where along the educational path of a
man who graduated cum laude from

Princeton and then magna cum laude
from Harvard Law, "Green Eggs and
Ham" would probably be covered.
And yet Cruz - with his impres-
sive educational background, self-
proclaimed fan-hood of Dr. Seuss
and, apparently, the rightful heir
to the green eggs and ham recipe -
somehow missed the actual mean-
ing of the classic children's story
and, ironically enough, strengthened
arguments of those who support the
landmark health-care bill.
We don't yet know the entirty of
what the ACA will do for America. It
could destroy this nation, it could be
the greatest step forward in Ameri-
can history or it could have absolute-
ly no effect on any of our lives - we
don't know because it hasn't been
implemented yet.
What we do know is this: More
than 44-million Americans are unin-
sured. Approximately 17.9 percent
of our GDP is spent on health care
costs compared to the European
Union average
of 8.3 percent.
And, accord- Most An
ing to the World
Health Organi- simply
zation, America under
ranks 38th in
health care qual- the A
ity (Costa Rica
beat us, but don't
worry, we're ahead of Slovenia).
Everyone agrees that we have a
problem. Well, except for pharma-
ceutical and insurance companies
who have contributed close to half a
billion dollars to political candidates
over the last five years. It's weird how
you can donate that much money, and
suddenly Congress votes 42 times to
defund the law that would slash your
incomparably high profits, but that's
a different column altogether.
What people don't agree on is how
to fix this problem. Inl2010, President
Barack Obama signed the ACA and
last summer the US Supreme Court
upheld the bill as constitutional.
Three years after the bill became
law and one year before the law actu-
ally goes into effect, Republicans are
threatening to shut down the govern-
ment unless the ACA is defunded. As

r.
y
,
..

Cruz reiterated in his glorified tem-
per tantrum, Republicans are say-
ing that the ACA must be repealed
because of the detrimental effects it
has had on America. But other than
allowing children to stay on their
parents' health-care plan until age
26 andbanning insurance companies
from not accepting people with pre-
existing conditions, the ACA hasn't
been able to actually do anything yet.
Republicans claim that busi-
nesses are preparing for the bill by
making employees work less than
the 30-hours-per-week threshold
that defines a full-time employee in
order to avoid paying for health care.
While it is true that America has seen
a rapid growth in part-time jobs and
millions of Americans remain under-
employed, this trend was happening
well before the ACA, and economists
argue that the economy is mostly to
blame for this pattern, not the ACA.
Most Americans simply don't
understand the ACA. A recent poll in
the Wall Street
Journal showed
rericans that 70 percent of
T don't Americans don't
know what's in
stand the bill. CNBC
also released
kCA. a poll showing
that 46 percent
of Americans
oppose "Obamacare," yet only 37
percent oppose the bill when dubbed
"The Affordable Care Act." I'm going
to go ahead and assume those 9 per-
cent of respondents who answered
differently when the title changed
are part of the 70 percent of people
who don't understand the bill.
Instead of shutting down our gov-
ernment, which will likely happen
Tuesday night, why can't we try and
see the effects of the ACA?
Let's learn from Dr. Seuss and
actually implement the ACA instead
of trying to repeal something that
people don't understand. Once
America tries a bite and gives a
damn, we will realize the ACA isn't
so bad, Sam-I-Am.

The proposal first came to
vote at the Sept. 2 meeting but
failed to garner enough support
among City Council members.
After being reconsidered and
postponed at the Sept. 16 meet-
ing, council members have been
evaluating the possibility of the
r divestiture without adding risk
to the pension fund.
However, a resolution from
council doesn't necessarily mean
divestment will occur: council
members don't have the power to
direct the investment decisions
a of the Pension Board, so the pro-
posal would be merely an expres-
sion of support for divestment.
Similar movements for divest-
ment from traditional fossil-
fuel-focused energy companies
have been cropping up across the
country as the movement gains
more attention. Over the sum-

Metzer said the suspect was on

Metzer said.
A pedestrian standing with a

"A lot of our problems require
technology and science solutions,
but also social and behavioral
sciences need to be a part of the
mix if we're going to try to solve
global warming, adequate food
supply and all of those tough
problems we face," Dearborn
chancellor Daniel Little said.
Another major theme revolved
around improving the Dear-
born campus' competitiveness in
recruiting talented students since
it faces stiff competition from
other regional universities. The
Dearborn budget is also highly
tuition-sensitive. Dearborn Busi-
ness Dean Nagraj Balakrishnan
estimated in his public remarks
to the committee that around 80
percent of the campus's budget
comes from tuition alone.
In an interview after the event,
Little said he was proud that
Dearborn faculty had come out
and shared their concerns with
the members of the committee.
"We are distinct campuses,
but we are complementary cam-
puses," Little said. "On the Dear-
born campus, we have done an

excellent job of articulating a
metropolitan vision for this cam-
pus ... I think as a campus, we
have embraced the idea that this
campus exists to serve and help
move forward the communities
of southeast Michigan."
Little added that the Dear-
born campus has to face the
unique challenge and historical
issues of racial segregation and
economic separation - with 60
percent of its students being the
first generation in their family to
go to college. About 42 percent
of Dearborn students are eligible
for federal Pell Grants.
Jung Koral, transfer and inter-
national student advisor in the
College of Engineering and Com-
puter Science at the Dearborn
campus, said that in his travels to
other higher-education schemes
such as the University of Califor-
nia and the University of Texas
systems, he saw much higher lev-
els of integration among multiple
campuses.
"I don't understand why the
campuses aren't more closely
linked with one another," Koral
said. "It just makes sense."
Koral, who has worked at all

three campuses, said during his
time at the University of Michi-
gan, Flint, regional competitor
Saginaw Valley State University
was "blowing us out of the water"
in terms of student recruitment.
He added that the University
of Michigan, Dearborn faces
tough competition from Wayne
State University and Oakland
University - but being tied to
the Ann Arbor campus provides
Dearborn with a unique, if not
fully exploited, advantage.
"If you're in a dogfight on the
neighborhood block and your big
brother comes up and says, 'no,
this is my brother,' suddenly the
other kids scatter away," Choral
said.
No current Dearborn students
attended Friday's forum.
Later Friday, around 20 peo-
ple attended the final search
forum, which was held in Blau
Auditorium at the Ross School
of Business. Participants praised
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's tenure as president
and said they hoped for someone
with a long-term plan to main-
tain the national profile of the
University.

"This idea of reaching out to
undergrads is really fairly new
when it comes to our grant-mak-
ing," Francis said. "You're see-
ing sort of a beginning of what
should be big in going forward."
Although the program is still
growing, Francis said they cur-
rently visitthree universities per
year and plan to expand to Indo-
nesia next year.
"A lot depends on how many
people we can get to support
these programs," Francis said.
"It's just a matter of getting the
right people to evaluate and
make it happen. So, the sky's the
limit."
National Geographic supports
this demographic - 18 to 25
year olds - through individual
grants of up to $5,000,which are
awarded to select undergradu-
ates after a competitive applica-
tion process. In addition to the
lecture, the society sponsored
a workshop session Saturday to
teach students how to get the
financial support to follow their
passions.
"We go to institutions to teach
people how to ask us for money,"
Francis said. "And we also teach
people how to ... compact their
ideas - their dreams - into,
sometimes, 'elevator pitches'
that then can get people excit-
ed."
Students at the workshop
were also given the opportunity
to practice pitching their proj-
ects to the National Geographic
officials who are in charge of the
grant application decisions.
To date, National Geograph-
ic has provided 84 grants to
individuals at the University,
totaling more than $1 million,
according to Francis. He said
the decision to host an event on
campus this year was prompted
by the history of involvement in
the program by current and for-
mer University students.
"It's always been a hotspot,"
Francis said. "It's one of those
places that's on the map already
as a leading academic institu-
tion."
The event was highlighted
by presentations from two for-
mer National Geographic grant
recipients: William Saturno,
an assistant professor at Bos-
ton University, and profes-

sional climber Mark Synnott, a
filmmaker and researcher for
National Geographic and The
North Face.
Saturno spoke about his
research in Guatemala, where
he has spent more than a decade
finding and excavating ancient
Mayan archeological sites.
With the help of NASA satel-
lite images, Saturno was able to
visualize changes in tree color
around ancient Mayan settle-
ments, allowing him to locate
countless new structures and
relics.
Saturno has received multiple
grants from National Geograph-
ic, and he encouraged students
to seek similar support for their
areas of interest. He also dis-
cussed the importance of being
able to generate public support
for your projects.
"One of the important things
about working with Geographic
is being opened to narrative,"
Saturno said. "And being open
to the fact that other people can
probably tell your story better
than you."
Synnott's presentation chron-
icled his path to becoming a
self-described "professional
explorer." In particular, he dis-
cussed his development as a
professional climber, which has
sent him locations around the
world - most recently, the Per-
sian Gulf.
Synnott encouraged students
interested in grants to research
projects that have already
been funded before starting a
new project. Before every trip,
he catalogs any prior work or
exploration done in the area,
allowing him to find new areas
to explore.
"I'm not the first person who's
had this idea," Synnott said. "A
lot of really smart, amazing peo-
ple have dedicated their lives to
exploring our world."
Many grant recipients use
their experiences as a pathway
to careers or graduate programs
in their chosen field. Francis said
he hopes the grantswill inspire a
new generation of explorers and
researchers, thus ensuring the
continued mission of National
Geographic.
"The idea is you help people
along their way, you get a good
story back, you tell it to the
world and great things happen,"
Francis said. "This program, we
believe, is our effort to really
change the future."


came through the Mayors Inno-
vation Project, an initiative that
involves cities across the country
committing to combat climate
change and other projects. Stu-
dent groups at the University of
California, Berkeley were also
very vocal in supporting divest-
ment.
Similar to the Ann Arbor pro-
posal, the Berkeley proposal was
a request from the city to CalP-
ERS - a large retirement fund
the city has about $1.6 billion
invested in - to divest from fos-
sil fuels over a five-year period,
Moe said.
Moe said while divestment
would likely send a signal to
other cities to support the effort,
the practical implications are
still being explored and the city
is still involved in other sustain-
ability efforts.
"We certainly don't look at
this as a silver bullet or we will
hang our hats solely on the issue
of divestment, but this comes
within a package of climate-mit-
igation and climate-adaptation
programs that we, Berkeley, as a
city are working on," Moe said.
Moe added that while a divest-
ment plan has yet to be imple-
mented, he thinks the topic has
at least opened the discussion on
divestment and climate change

solutions.
In Ann Arbor, council mem-
bers, members of the pension
board and members of the ener-
gy commission are also in the
process of exploring the divest-
ment's financial implications.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) sent an e-mail to the
involved parties explaining the
possible fund options for the pen-
sion. Lumm said the city essen-
tially faces a choice between
low-fee index funds and the more
costly, highly managed fund.
The issue, according to Lumm,
is that there are very few index
funds without fossil fuel as a por-
tion of their diversified portfolio,
and excluding those investments
would decrease returns.
Nancy Walker, executive
director of the Ann Arbor
Employees' Retirement System,
declined to comment for this
article. The Investment Policy
Committee will meet Tuesday
and the Administrative Policy
and Audit Committee will meet
on Oct. 8.
Kai Petainen, a lecturer in
the Business School, has been
advising the city council against
divestment. In an essay sent to
the council members, Petainen
wrote that the proposal asks for
the Pension Board to divest from

200 fossil-fuel companies, adding
that that eliminating an entire
sector of a portfolio is never
advisable.
Petainen also wrote that he
is unaware of any index funds
without fossil fuel invest-
ment and that the umbrella of
the proposed divested stocks
could potentially be widened to
include other large companies
like General Electric, which is
involved in supplying materials
to the energy sector.
He also wrote that the propos-
al includes several other flaws,
including a request to support
local projects, which could risk
issues of insider trading. His let-
ter concluded that the Pension
Board might consider removing a
handful of companies, but elimi-
nating all of them is fiscally irre-
sponsible.,
Councilmember Lumm said
that as much as the council wants
to make the symbolic gesture for
environmental awareness, such a
proposal would put the indepen-
dent Pension Board in a tough
position.
"We can't, nor should we, tie
the hands of the retirement man-
ager," Lumm said. "We're kind of
saying, 'You should do this but
you don't have to,' and I think
that's tough for them."


CONTRACT
From Page 1A
the letter from Fransway said
gaining the company's approval
is "customary and routine," Ful-
ton said 3P interpreted the con-
tract as assurance that Cottage
Inn trusted 3P's decisions.
In an e-mail Wednesday,
Fransway wrote that if further
legal action is taken, he is con-
fident Cottage Inn will win out.
" ... One of the great freedoms
that we enjoy in this country is
the right to present disputes like
this one to fair and impartial
judges who judge disputes based
upon facts and not merely some-
one's opinion that they are enti-
tled to something," Fransway
wrote. "We feel confident that if
a court proceeding does occur,
Cottage Inn will prevail based
upon the facts in this case."
The main point of contention
between the parties lies with

3P's actor choice for Cottage
Jim. Fulton said Cottage Inn
didn't like how local comedian
and actor, Marty Smith, looked
as Cottage Jim. He added that
Cottage Inn asked 3P, after see-
ing the completed videos, if
there was a way to put someone
else's face on Smith's body.
3P has since disbanded due
to lack of funds after going over
budget on the Cottage Inn vid-
eos and not receiving the second
$4,500 installment.
For the videos, 3P hired pro-
fessionals to work aspects of
the production, instead of the
student production teams they
usually used, and upgraded to a
higher-quality camera.
"We wanted to give them as
much value as possible so we
could foster a relationship that
would ultimately lead to future
work together," Pere said. "We
were very confident with our
abilities and, unfortunately, it
was not seen the same way by
Cottage Inn."

Gandolfini and

mused. It captured the age-old
social disconnect between over-
sexed youth and over-grayed
elderly. Soft-shelled yet emotively
dense, one of James Gandolfini's
final pictures reminds us of how
marriage and divorce each tell a
remarkably similar narrative and
how humor is relative.

Is Beyonce a femme fatale
or a third-wave feminist?

By HANNAH WEINER
Daily Arts Writer
She's a brand, a household name
- she's even on the big screen at
the Big House. And she's married
to arguably the biggest and most
commercially successful rapper of
this era. She's the halftime show
of the Superbowl, she's sexy, she's
rich. To put it simply: Beyonce is
powerful.
And, so what?
The answer to this question
lies in the minds of academics
far more learned on American
culture and feminism than myself,
but it's worth asking. Because it
matters that Beyoncd presents
herself in an overtly sexualized
outfit and performance during
the Superbowl halftime show. It
matters that she took Jay Z's last
name - and that he took her last
name, too. It mattersthat she sings
"Bow Down, Bitches." .
It matters that, in the beginning
of her film, she says, "I truly
believe that women should be
financially independent from their
men. And let's face it: Money gives
men the power to run the show.
It gives men the power to define

value. They define what's sexy.
And men define what's feminine.
It's ridiculous."
It matters that she's a self-
proclaimed feminist.
It matters that Beyonce
straddles the line between
objectified and empowered,
sexual hedonism and militant
feminism. Remember when she
sang the lines: "The shoes on my
feet, I've bought it / The clothes
I'm wearing, I've bought it / The
rock I'm rockin', I've bought it /
'Cause I depend on me"? Beyonce
has undoubtedly bought all these
things and more. She's financially
independent, which gives her
power to "run the show" and
define value. With this power and
position, she can sway the mindsof
young America to redefine what's
sexy and valuable.
But, Beyonce knows that the
game is the game. She knows that
her audience includes men who
love nothing more than submitting
her to the "male gaze." So, while
those sexy, dominatrix outfits
(a la Superbowl halftime show
and "Single Ladies" music video)
show "control" of her sexuality,
they also cater directly to a male

In the midst of its Final

the Michigan men's basketball
team began branding itself as
Team 96, celebrating what was
thought to be the 96th year of
the basketball program.
That was until, "we discov-

When it comes to protecting vulnerable, department has head in the sky

Write this in the sky:
the problem with the
Michigan Athletic
Department isn't that it blundered
the basketball student season-
ticket process,
nor is it the
change in
the football v
ticket policy.
It isn't that it
has painted
the sky with
its own name ZACH
or that it has HELFAND
marketed
nearly every
marketable piece of tradition left
in this school.
It's certainly not the misguided
assertion that somehow the Ath-
letic Department is making too
much money.
The problem is that, at a public
non-profit institution, that money
is supposed to support some mis-
sion. The problem is that instead
of supporting some mission, the
Athletic Department is throw-
ing money into the troposphere;
meanwhile, it won't shell out the
money that could protect summer
campers, entrusted to the depart-
ment's care, from abuse.
Last Tuesday, Athletic Camp
Administrator Katie Miranto said
that the department doesn't run
thorough background checks on
its summer camp counselors and
doesn't provide any sexual-abuse
prevention training. Currently,
the department only checks for
crimes committed in the state of
Michigan, even though a third
of its counselors are from out of
state.
"I can't even describe to you
how many gaps there are and how
nervous I get over the summer,"
Miranto said at a forum Tuesday.
By now, the line between the
Michigan Athletic Department
and a corporation is microscopic.
And that's not necessarily bad; it's
a reality of competing in current
college athletics.
Yet to the critics, the Athletic

even more money. Modern ath-
letic departments aren't corpora-
tions, even if they are now nearly
indistinguishable. There are no
shareholders to report to and no
dividends to issue.
To return to the Classics
Department example, its mis-
sion is to educate students and
improve its academic standingto
contribute to Michigan's general
reputation. That's why it wants
to improve facilities and hire the
best professors.
The Athletic Department's
mission, in theory, is the same: to
serve its student-athletes and to
serve as atool that promotes the
University as awhole. And the
money is important, as it helps the
University continue to projecta
tradition of winning.
But when the Athletic Depart-
ment neglects a broader back-
ground check each of which
would cost less than say, oh, a sky-
written message, that represents
some deeply misplaced priorities.
It has strayed fromthe mission
and diluted the very brand it seeks
to uphold when the department
failed to protect its most vulner-
able constituents. Ithas failed,
so muchso that Miranto said she
has trouble sleeping at night due
to the security lapses. Not exactly
a vote of confidence from the
woman in charge of running the
summer camps. If something ter-
rible were to happen, it would be
pretty clear where the blame is.
The greatthing about having a
$137.5 million budget and a pro-
jected surplus of $8.9 million is
that it can pay for things that real-
ly matter. Things like protecting
campers from abuse. That, above
all, is what all the "Wow experi-
ences" and Kraft noodles and fly-
overs are supposed to pay for.
But instead of protecting the
children entrusted into its care,
the Athletic Department was too
busy painting its name in the sky.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon has been criticized forticket policies, but the real issue is that the department won't pay for expanded background checks.

Department suffers from a greed
problem. If any year has symbol-
ized the current department's
oversized spending and money-
grabbing, it is this year, right?
This department has introduced
a temporary giant Kraft noodle
advertisement in Michigan Sta-
dium, spent thousands on a con-
troversial skywriting marketing
campaign and oversold the Michi-
gan basketball student section,
so that the students who paid for
guaranteed tickets to each bas-
ketball game would no longer be
guaranteed tickets to each basket-
ball game.
But those critics that demon-
ize the department's profits are
missing the point. The problem
isn't thatthe Athletic Department
has chosen to funda skywriting
campaign. The problem is that the
Athletic Department has chosen
to fund a skywriting campaign
rather than pay to protect vulner-

able children. How did we get
here?
The money isn't the problem.
Ignoring, for a moment, the fact
that college athletic departments
make their money off athletes
who are not allowed to profit off
their labor (and yes, this is a major
point to ignore), more money
is not a bad thing. For a public
institution that receives taxpayer
money, more money from any
source otherthan the taxpayers
is a good thing. The fact that the
Michigan Athletic Department
can sustain itself is a very good
thing.
Money funds scholarships
and maintains teams. It builds
the buildings thatbring in the
recruits. The Classics Department
wants more money to improve its
facilities and hire the best profes-
sors. The Athletic Department
does too.
So when the department pays

thousands of dollars to put its
name in the sky, the only question
worth asking is: Is this profitable?
Michigan's chief marketing
officer, Hunter Lochmann, says
yes. After criticism of the skywrit-
ing campaign, Lochmann posted
several responses on Twitter.
"When it was all said and done,
each message cost about $100," he
wrote in one message. "The ROI?
the best marketingctactic we do
each year."
That sounds reasonable. And
it is not withoutprecedent.
Before skywriting, there were
helicopters: former Michigan
Athletic Director Don Canham
had a helicopter advertise for
Michigan football over a Detroit
Tigers World Series game in 1968.
The reaction was negative then,
too, but today no one objects that
Canham's marketing efforts mod-
ernized and funded the future of
Michigan athletics.

Then came Tuesday, when
Miranto exposed holes in the
Athletic Department's back-
ground checks.
The revelation was troubling.
The reasoning was predictable.
Miranto said the department
didn'tperform broader back-
ground checks because they
couldn't afford it.
"That is a huge area of concern
right now, butthe way the system
is built, it's really our only option
for cost reasons, for how fast we
need to turn the background
check around," Miranto said.
And there's the problem.
Money is good for the Athletic
Department if it serves some
greater mission. That mission
should go further than just fund-
ing the $850,000 base salary
that Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon will earn this
year. The mission should also go
furtherthan the acquisition of

out of a late timeout. The Wolver-
ines dropped four of the final five
points to give Ohio State a 25-22
win and a 1-0 lead in the match.
They recovered in the second
set, though, taking the Buckeyes
down to the wire and eventually
pulling out a 27-25 win that dead-
locked the match at one.
After dropping the third set,
25-20, Michigan began the fourth
with a ferocity it hadn'tyet shown
on the evening, jumping out to a
4-1 advantage behind more hero-
ics from the night's stars, senior
outside hitter Molly Toon and
senior setter Lexi Dannemi-
ller. The pair paced the Wolver-
ines with 16 kills and 44 assists,
respectively, and was strong
offensively for Michigan through-
out the weekend despite the 0-2
finish.
Butthe stretch of energetic play
was short-lived - Ohio State won
11 of the next 12 points to take a
15-5 lead and coasted the rest of
the way to earn the 3-1 victory.
"Molly played really well all
weekend," said Michigan coach
Mark Rosen. "I think Dannemi-
ller and (senior middle blocker)
Jennifer Cross did a great job
together, too."
Despite the duo's performance,
Rosen lamented his team's lack
of consistency over the weekend,
especially against the Buckeyes.
"We gave up streaks of points,"
Rosen said. "In this conference,
you have to be steady. Top to bot-
tom, the Big Ten is ridiculously
difficult."
That top-to-bottom strength
had already showed its face on
Friday night - like the Wolver-
ines, Penn State entered Saturday
night's top-10 showdown licking
its wounds, having been upset a
night earlier by Michigan State.
But the Nittany Lions had won
42 of their last 45 games against
Michigan at Rec Hall and showed
no signs of bucking that trend in
front of a rowdy crowd of 3,506.
The first set on Saturday night
saw a head-to-head battle in the
early going between Toon and
Penn State's Megan Courtney,
the reigning Big Ten Freshman
of the Year. But the Nittany Lions
pulled away to a 15-10 lead mid-

Senior outside hitter Molly Toon had 37 combined kills over two games this weekend, but it wasn't enough for Michigan.

way through the set, and Michi-
gan never recovered, droppingthe
set 25-16.
Penn State repeatedly took
advantage of space left between
the Wolverines' right-side block
and the unsuspecting back line
of defenders, earning several
easy points on soft drop shots
that fell into open space, often in
front of sophomore libero Tiffany
Morales.
"We adjusted well," Rosen said.
"We took that away eventually.
No matter what defense you use,
there will be space for the other
team to tryto take advantage of."
The second set remained com-
petitive throughout, with neither

side taking a lead of more than
two points until Cross and Toon
combined for an over-the-middle
block that gave the Wolverines an
18-15 lead.
The Nittany Lions came storm-
ing back to tie the game at 19,
prompting Rosen to take a time-
out. But Toon took control of the
set in its closingmoments, earning
two kills and a crucial block that,
coupled with a pair of Penn State
attack errors, put the Wolverines
up 24-19.
Fittingly, Toon closed the set
out off yet another feed from
Dannemiller, but that was the last
of Michigan's success. Coming out
of the break, the Nittany Lions

thoroughly controlled the flow of
the game in the third and fourth
sets and sent the Wolverines home
winless in the Big Ten.
"We're still in a good place,"
Toon soon. "We like playing com-
petitive teams. We're obviously I
upset about the losses, but (our
play this weekend) gives us a good
starting point from now on."
Rosen reiterated that the
strength of the conference is
unprecedented, and that achiev-
ing success on aweek-to-week I
basis against such elite competi-
tion is easier said than done.
"The Big Ten is the strongest
it's ever been," Rosen said. "We've
got to adjust to that level of play."

na was yet again at the center
of the action on Northwest-
ern's second goal, as he played
a beautiful one-touch pass over
the Michigan defense. While
the Wolverines defense watched
the ball go over their heads,
Northwestern forward Joey
Calistri - the Big Ten's leading
scorer - made a run and found
himself with a one-on-one with
Grinwis and skillfully shot the
ball underneath the sprawling
goalie.
Unlike the Wildcats, who
were clinical with their chanc-
es, the Wolverines were sloppy.

In the 17th minute, redshirt
sophomore midfielder Colin
McAtee intercepted an errant
pass at midfield and passed
the ball to Murphy down the
field in a two-on-one situation.
However, Michigan could not
capitalize on the mistake by the
Wildcats as Murphy held on to
the ball too long. When he tried
to pass it back to McAtee, it was
intercepted by a Northwestern
defender.
Pereira - playing away from
his usual position in the mid-
field - also had a golden chance
to put the Wolverines on the
board in the 59th minute. He
took a pass from McAtee inside
the six-yard box, but his shot at
point-blank range skied over the

goal. He buried his head into his
hands in disappointment.
Even though the game result-
ed in zero points for the Wol-
verines, the team dominated
a top-10 team in every facet of
the game besides the two errant
goals that were scored by the
Wildcats. The admirable per-
formance shown by Michigan
on Saturday night bodes well
for the match against West-
ern Michigan on Wednesday
and the resumption of Big Ten
schedule.
"It's still a long season to go,"
Pereira said. "We just have to
focus on Western Michigan and
getting out of there with three
points."

Redshirt sophomore midfielder Colin McAtee had several near-assists over the weekend, but no one could capitalize.

the right side of the net that was
saved by Richard. The Wolver-
ines ended up tying the Badgers
in shots at 13, but could not capi-
talize on any of them.
"The tie with Wisconsin was
a fair result," said Ryan. "I think
they are a very good team and
both (Wisconsin and Michi-
gan) played exceptionally hard.
I felt like we brought that again
today. I thought we played hard, I
thoughtwe playedwell,butagain,
in soccer you got to put away your
chances to win games."
This difficulty in scoring can
be attributed to the team's inac-
curacy on goal. Most of the shots
taken ended up wide of the net or
far above the crossbar.
But while the team's offensive
struggles are ever apparent, the
defense continues to shine. The
Badgers were barely able to cross
midfield - their first shot of the
half came 40 minutes in. The
Wolverines also put a lot of pres-
sure on two of Wisconsin's stron-
gest players, midfielder/forward
Rose Lavelle and forward Cara
Walls, who other teams have
struggled to defend.
"None of (Lavelle's shots) were
threatening," Ryan said. "She
was under pressure the whole
M night. We gave (senior midfielder
Megan) Toohey the role of just
shutting that kid down because
nobody else has been able to do it.
I thought Megan may be player of
the match for us because of han-
dling that."
Friday's game was also one
of the more physically challeng-
ing matchups that Michigan has
played this season, as players

were often slow to get up after
tackles. In the 18th minute of the
Wisconsin game, senior forward
Shelby Chambers-Garcia was
knocked hard to the ground, and
a yellow card was issued to Bad-
ger defender Alexander Heller.
Senior midfielder Tori McCombs
and Wisconsin midfielder/for-
ward Lindsey Holmes had an
argument on field with some
shoving.
Throughout the weekend, the
Wolverines' offense was aggres-
sive and pushed downfield with
ease. When it came to putting
pressure on the other team and
creating passing lanes, Michi-
gan was excellent. It broke past
defenders with speed and agil-
ity to get in positions that cre-
ated many scoring opportunities.
However, the Wolverines con-
tinue to struggle with finishing
their chances.
This scoring drought was more
evident and more problematic in
the Wolverines' second contest
against Minnesota (0-2-0, 7-2).
Despite outshooting the Gophers
18-6, Michigan's weekend ended
with their second loss.
"Today wehad the chancesbut
just didn't put them away," Ryan
said. "I mean look at the ones
right in front of the goal."
The closest chance Michigan
had to tie the game came late
in the second half off a corner
kick from senior defender She-
lina Zadorsky to senior defender
Holly Hein in the 52nd minute.
Hein had a wide-open net but did
not have the angle she needed to
head the ball in the right direc-
tion.
Minnesota's game-winning
goal off a ball from midfielder
Katie Thyken was bad timing
for Michigan's defense. After a

corner kick by junior midfielder
Jen Larrick, confusion occurred
in front of the penalty box as
players lined up in front of fresh-
man goalie Taylor Bucklin. With
Bucklin unable to pinpoint the
ball, Thyken launched one over
the line of players toward the
right side of the net.
"The real difficulty was, I
think Taylor was screened on
the play," Ryan said. "We had
that wall of players around her.
I think it just went over some-
body's shoulder, and then she
didn't see it until it was (in the
net)."
Similar to Wisconsin, Sunday
was physically trying for players
on both sides. Minnesota goalie
Tarah Hobbs's crash with fresh-
man midfielder Nicky Waldeck
required a break in the game,
as it took a few minutes for her
to recover while Waldeck was a
little shaken.
"I'm glad there weren't any
injuries," Ryan said. "If we can
keep our team healthy, we can
compete with any team in the
conference. Staying healthy is
crucial."
While Michigan is having a
hard time converting its chances
into goals, the Wolverines con-
tinue to practice it to avoid losses
like this weekend's. Ten different
players have scored this season,
and 15 players have recorded
at least one point. Michigan's
main problem is playing consis-
tently well. Ryan mentioned they
always work on finishing in the
penalty box through matchups
between players, four-on-four or
five-on-five.
"Even though the results
are not good," Ryan said. "I'm
encouraged bythe performances
of the players."

practice.
"Six extra practices should
really be helpful for us."
Fifth-year senior forward Jor-
dan Morgan highlighted a spe-
cific area where the rule could
particularly benefit Walton,
explaining that Beilein always
opens fall practices by reteach-
ing even the most basic funda-
mentals such as "how to catch
the ball." That made an already-
tight window even smaller
for the newcomers to pick up
Beilein's complex offense.
"We've had months now
where that stuff is already
engrained in everybody, even
the freshmen," Morgan said of
the differences in this year's
offseason. "Now we can focus
on trying to establish an identity
in our offense and defense."
This isn't the first time in
Beilein's seven-year Michigan
tenure where a freshman point
guard is poised to play significant
minutes. Burke, and Darius Mor-
ris before him, each arrived in
Ann Arbor as highly-acclaimed
recruits and departed two years
later as NBA Draft picks.

"I've been doing ita long time,
so it seems like every couple
years, you're breaking in a new
guard," Beilein said. "They're the
quarterback. They're the one you
probably have to the greatest con-
nection with. So I'm pretty used
toit."
But still, that doesn't neces-
sarily make it easier for Beilein,
who was asked how long it'll take
for him to trust Walton with his
"Now we can
focus on trying
to establish an
identity..."
offense's reins.
"Every young man, it takes
a while," Beilein said. "Trust
maybe isn't the right word - I
trust them all - just make sure
that we're on the same page is the
biggest issue.
"Itrustthey'relearningiswhat
I trust and as a result, I expect
him tobe like every freshman, to
have some moments where I'm

like, 'What are you thinking?' and
at the same time, I'll say, 'Are you
getting it?' So this young man,
from everything that I've seen
so far, has the ability to pick up
things pretty quickly."
Notes: Beilein announced
that sophomore forward Mitch
McGary has been limited in
practice with what he called a
"lower back condition." McGary,
who had a breakout postseason
run that landed him on several
early preseason All-America
teams, is officially listed as day-
to-day and isn't expected to miss
any game time. ... According to
Beilein, he and his assistants will
focus on individual players for
the next two weeks, and he said
it's unlikely any concrete lineup
decisions will be made until exhi-
bition season. The Wolverines
open with Concordia on Oct. 29,
10 days before the regular season
officially kicks off.
