When LSA senior Sophia 
Georginis 
interviewed 
for 
a 
summer 
job 
at 
Comedy 
Central last year, then studying 
screen arts and cultures at the 
University of Michigan, she was 
asked was to define her major. 
Georginis explained she studied 
film, television and media and 
ended up getting the job, but 
realized her department’s name 
presented a significant obstacle 
to employment.
“Screen arts and cultures to 
a lot of employers didn’t really 
mean much because it was a 
bunch of words strung together 
that didn’t mean a lot to people 

in the industry,” Georginis said. 
“If they didn’t really know what 
we were studying, in a pool of 
thousands and thousands of 
kids, it was just difficult to be 
like, ‘Yes, this is film, television 
and media,’ if they look at your 
major and they don’t even know 
what it is.”
However, on Sept. 1, the 
department changed its name 
after 
14 
years. 
Georginis, 
along with all other formerly-
called screen arts and cultures 
students, 
became 
Film, 
Television, and Media majors. 
Georginis said she was pleased 
with the change.
“The 
new 
name 
change 
makes a lot of sense because 
it’s just so forward,” she said. “I 

More than 70 University of 
Michigan students and faculty 
members attended an interview 
Wednesday featuring former 
juvenile lifer Edward Sanders 
in a lecture titled “From Prison 
to Paralegal.” The Information 
Alliance 
for 
Community 
Development and the School of 
Information jointly hosted the 
event, which explored Sanders’ 
experience in prison and efforts 
to obtain an education, as well 
as his reintroduction into a 
technologically-focused society.
Sanders was 17 years old 
when he was convicted with 
accessory 
to 
murder 
and 
imprisoned in 1975. As the 
lecture, he expressed his regret 
for what happened that day and 
explained how it changed his 
life forever.
“I made a mistake when I was 

17 years old and I recognize that 
someone lost their life. I didn’t 
pull the trigger, but I was there,” 
he said. “There’s no snapping 
my finger and getting them to 
come back. I know what death 
means.”
After spending 42 years in 
prison, Sanders was released 
on July 6, 2017. Upon entry 
to 
prison, 
he 
described 
his education level was at 
approximately 
third 
grade, 
which was one of the reasons he 
was so motivated to spend time 
trying to earn an undergraduate 
degree.
“Most of my time in prison 
was spent in four places: in 
the yard running, the inmates’ 
library, the school or Islamic 
services,” he said.
He faced several challenges 
getting 
an 
education 
as 
a 
result of the prison institution 
structure. Because he received 
a life sentence, he was not 
prioritized for the provided 

educational opportunities. He 
could only attend on the basis 
that another inmate would 
decide not to pursue education.
“Every time that I made an 
effort to go to school, it was 
a challenge,” Sanders said. “I 
would have to wait to see if 
someone that intended to go 
didn’t go. And if they decided 
not to go, it was my fortune.”
While he was in prison, 
Sanders received his associate’s 
degree from Jackson College in 
paralegal studies, as well as a 
bachelor’s degree from Spring 
Arbor University in behavioral 
science.
Sanders then joined a group 
called the Lifer Law program, 
where he worked with other 
inmates, mostly veterans, to 
study legal texts and pay for 
attorneys to come lecture. The 
program also gave inmates 
resources to go to trial, even 
when 
discouraged 
by 
their 
attorneys.

Sanders said being able to use 
and benefit from this education 
was significant. Though he 
gained 40 years of paralegal 
experience, the likelihood of a 
career or even an entry-level 
job in the field of law is slim for 
former felons.
“There’s no looking for a 
career, and that reality hurt. So I 
began to do what other inmates 
did before me, which is assisting 
my fellow inmates,” he said.
Sanders highlighted prison 
institutional 
barriers 
to 
obtaining education, such as 
severe limitations on technology 
access. The prison in which 
he was incarcerated had ban 
on typewriters — they were 
considered a threat to security. 
Later, offline computers were 
provided to participate in legal 
research, but he explained the 
system was still inefficient.
“There is an institutional bias 

In 
this 
past 
week, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
has 
announced 
several 
new 
initiatives centered in Detroit. Of 
these initiatives are a partnership 
with 
Harvard 
University 
to 
address the opioid crisis and 
the 
P-20 
Partnership 
with 
Marygrove College to improve 
educational 
institutions. 
The 
P-20 Partnership implements a 
teacher residency, which allows 
teachers to work in rotations 
similar those of physicians, and 
a “cradle-to-career” pathway for 
students beginning as early as 
kindergarten. In the past year, 
the University also finalized the 
purchase of the remainder of the 
Horace H. Rackham Education 
Memorial Building in Detroit, 
which has been used previously 
for multiple projects and classes.
James Holloway, vice provost 
of 
Global 
Engagement 
and 
Interdisciplinary 
Academic 
Affairs, said Detroit, as an 
important urban area, presents 
opportunities for faculty and 
staff. He also said there are 
several questions that arise when 
approaching a project in Detroit.
“How do opportunities in 
Detroit align with our mission to 
develop generalizable knowledge 
and to educate a new generation?” 
Holloway said. “How do we do 
that in partnership and in ways 
building capacity and realizing 
opportunities for the various 
communities of Detroit?”

The play premiered in 2014 and 
is actually two separate plays 
that can be performed together 
or apart.
“Like all of Mee’s plays, 
‘Night

Day’ 
are 
not 
psychological, narrative-based 
dramas,” Kovacs said. “We 
can think of them as a collage 
because

to 
performances

even

Bro you are smack in the middle 
of a college campus we don’t 
give a FUCK

think that’s the thing –– there’s 
no need to make the name fancy 
if it just gets to what it’s talking 
about. What we are studying is 
film, television and media, so 
might as well call it that.”
According to a press release 
from the College of Literature, 
Science, and the Arts, the SAC 
name was initially adopted to 
be adaptable to the changing 
technologies of the industry. 
Department Chair Yeidy Rivero, 
however, heard many stories 
similar 
to 
Georginis’s 
from 
students, parents and alumni.
“Students didn’t know how to 

find the department. Parents of 
students didn’t know what their 
children were studying. Donors 
— many of them from Hollywood 
— didn’t know what ‘screen arts 
and culture’ meant,” Rivero said 
in the release. “I look forward to 
the day when students find the 
department not by chance, but 
because they came to Michigan 
deliberately to study in the 
Department of Film, Television, 
and Media.”
Rivero 
expressed 
her 
excitement for the name change 
in the release.
“Finally their employees will 
know what they studied!” she 
exclaimed. “‘Screen Arts and 
Culture’ — it’s, like, what?”
Business and LSA sophomore 
Andrew Armstrong, an FTVM 

major, agreed the new name 
better encompasses what the 
major actually involves and said 
attracting more students was 
likely part of the department’s 
reasoning.
“The real reason I think they 
changed the name was just 
so that they could try and get 
more people into it, because I 
think a lot of people are most 
interested in television than, 
say, film, or more interested in 
digital media,” he said. “People 
are more likely to sign up for a 
major if it’s very explicit, like 
history, 
English, 
mechanical 
engineering. You hear that and 
you know exactly what you’re 
getting into. Screen arts and 
culture is a little more vague.”
While the Film, Television, 
and 
Media 
Department 
has changed its name only 
once, 
other 
departments 
are on their third, or –– in 
the case of the formally-
called Department of Near 
Eastern Studies, now the 
Department 
of 
Middle 
East Studies –– their sixth 
designation.
The 
department 
effectively began in 1889 
under Carl William Belser, 
an assistant professor of 
“Oriental Languages” who 
taught Hebrew, Assyrian 
and Arabic. Since then, the 
department has been known 
as the Department of Semitic 
Studies, 
the 
Department 
of Oriental Languages and 
Literatures, the Department 
of Near Eastern Studies, the 
Department of Near Eastern 
Languages and Literatures, 
and now the Department of 
Middle East Studies.
As with previous changes, 
this most recent change 
is in keeping with the 
parlance of a large majority 
of students and faculty. In a 
departmental press release 

this month, Department Chair 
Gottfried Hagen noted how few 
people still use the term Near 
East. 
“‘Near East’ for a long time 
was used for the same region, 
in contradistinction to a Middle 
East and a Far East, denoting 
South and East Asia, respectively, 
but with changing perspectives, 
Near and Middle East came to 
mean more or less the same, and 
today, as a quick Google search 
will show, Near East is becoming 
obsolete,” Hagen wrote. “No 
name is perfect. ‘Middle East’ 
still smacks of Eurocentrism, 
for instance. But are we ready 
for ‘Department of West Asian, 
Southeast European, Caucasian, 
Iranian, and North African 
Studies’?”
Public Policy junior Nadia 
Hakim is minoring in Middle 
East 
studies 
and 
agreed 
changing the name will probably 
reduce confusion both for those 
studying it and those who are 
not.
“I kind of had an idea (of what 
Near East meant) but it was kind 
of this weird gray area, like, 
what is Near East referring to?” 
Hakim asked. “Whereas because 
we use Middle East more, it’s 
more concrete. I think the 
Middle East as a term also can be 
problematic, but I think it makes 
more sense. ‘I’m doing the minor 
in the Middle East.’ It just makes 
more sense.”
However, Hakim said, the 
name was nothing more than a 
tagline to her studies.
“I think the name itself is 
not the biggest thing that could 
change,” she said. “For me, it’s 
more content of classes, how 
they’re approaching the Middle 
East, what type of framework 
they’re applying to classes and 
stuff like that. The name itself, I 
think, is just a reflection of how 
we don’t really use the term Near 
East more than anything.”

because it was something on 
which he could collaborate 
with Knapik and Polish acting 
students. 
Collaboration 
made sense, Tulip explained, 
because 
of 
their 
shared 
artistic views, in addition 
to the political unrest under 
conservative administrations.
“These 
more-to-the-right 
administrations … seemed to 
be a common bond,” Tulip 
said. “We had artistic things 
in common, we had political 
struggles in common.”
Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor Vince Mountain, 
one of the designers of the play, 
discussed the performance’s 
visual aspects and explained 
how a combination of visuals, 
movement and sound are used 
to make the play come alive. 

He noted his appreciation of 
the unrefined, messy nature 
of Mee’s plays.
“(Mee) talks about on his 
website … he likes things that 
aren’t neat,” Mountain said. 
“He says I want things to 
crash into each other and be 
messy and be unresolved, and 
I do find a lot of mainstream 
theater is a little bit too neat. 
Personally, in my own work, 
I like things that are messy 
and crash into each other and 
so the opportunity to do this 
is really great because you do 
one thing, and other people 
contribute.”
Kovacs prompted the cast 
members to speak about their 
experience working on a play 

with a unique, movement-
based style. Music, Theatre 
& Dance junior Amanda Kuo 
was one of the actors who 
responded, touching on the 
freedom 
and 
vulnerability 
using her body to convey a 
message.
“Knowing that this was 
a dance theater piece also 
meant displaying your body 
and using that as a means of 
storytelling and putting an 
emphasis on that,” Kuo said. 
“It’s slightly liberating, but 
also puts you in a vulnerable 
place because it’s your body, 
it’s your whole self, not just 
the text. So in that way, this 
process has pushed us to stop 
thinking and just start doing, 
and trusting each other and 
creating images.”
Knapik explained how she 
pushed the actors to explore 
their 
movements, 
giving 
them room to improvise and 
create, but at the same time 
making sure they were testing 
themselves.
“It’s not addressing what 
people are dancing but what is 
really moving them,” Knapik 
said. “Addressing what kind 
of motion they have inside. 
Really I’m trying to make it 
in a very specific rhythm that 
can be challenging also for 
them. It’s something between 
being super strict and giving 
freedom to the creativity.”
This 
creativity 
and 
improvisation really appealed 
to Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Kathleen Taylor, who 
spoke about her appreciation 
of the play not adhering to one 
single statement.
“It’s been really fascinating 
for me to be able to work on 
this piece that is sort of messy 
and is not necessarily making 
any one particular statement 
other 
than 
that 
every 
decision we make is political, 
everything we’re putting out 
into the world at least I believe 
during this time has inherent 
political value,” Taylor said.
Music, Theatre & Dance 
junior 
Daniel 
Flick 
said 
attending the play would be a 
valuable experience for every 
potential audience member.
“I don’t think there’s a 
specific audience I would 
want to see this,” Flick said. 
“I think everyone can take 
something away from it and 
I think it will challenge 
everyone’s beliefs in a certain 
way to a certain extent.”

of state it can be a real motivator 
for people to come out that don’t 
normally because it’s so unique.”
Stabenow, who is up for 
reelection in November, opened 
the 
event 
by 
stressing 
the 
importance of voting in the 
midterm election. Among other 
prominent issues this year, she 
highlighted clean water, universal 
health care, net neutrality, college 
debt alleviation and Great Lake 
protections.
“You understand what’s at 
stake,” Stabenow said. “We are 
at a point in time where literally 
everything we care about is on 
the ballot.”
She also acknowledged the 
historically lackluster turnout 
rates across the state and stressed 
this election needs to be a turning 
point for Michigan.
“Michigan 
traditionally, 
unfortunately, has the distinction 
of being the state with the lowest 
turnout 
in 
non-presidential 
years,” Stabenow said. “Think 
about that. This year, we have to 
change that.”

In both the 2014 and 2010 
midterm 
elections, 
however, 
voter turnout in Michigan was 
above the national averages of 37.8 
and 36.3 percent, respectively. 
Voter turnout rates for the 2018 
primary rose from 2014 levels, 
however, indicating turnout may 
increase come November.
Kennedy began his segment by 
asking the audience members to 
shout out what issues they cared 
about the most. He collected 
a long list of issues –– climate 
change, access and affordability of 
higher education, a woman’s right 
to choose, gun control, universal 
health care, immigration, racial 
inequality –– and had audience 
members raise hands to vote their 
personal top three issues.
He then shared some statistics 
about today’s economy and the 
financial 
hurdles 
millennials 
face. 
According 
to 
Kennedy, 
millennials have to work 4,500 
hours of a minimum wage job to 
afford a college degree, whereas 
baby boomers only had to work 
300 hours.
Additionally, Kennedy said, 
20 percent of the economy is 
now essentially a contract or gig 
economy, so the protections that 
came with secure employment 

are gone. He also shared about 
half of millennials have zero 
savings. Kennedy used these facts 
as a motivator for young voters to 
be engaged and decide on policies 
that will benefit their futures and 
ease financial anxieties.
“I promise you, you will decide 
this election, period,” Kennedy 
said. “You’ll decide it because 
you vote, or you’ll decide it 
because you don’t … You guys 
have a chance to actually send a 
message to every single politician 
and aspiring politician about the 
direction of the nation that we see 
today.”
Kildee, 
Dingell, 
Driskell 
and Brown also talked about 
the importance of youth voter 
engagement in the midterms. 
Kildee discussed Flint, Michigan, 
which lies in his congressional 
district, as an example of failed 
government leadership.
“What happened in Flint was 
not a storm, it wasn’t an accident. 
It 
wasn’t 
some 
unforeseen, 
unpreventable disaster,” Kildee 
said. “It was the predictable result 
of a philosophy of government 
that says those kids (from Flint) 
come last, and the people at the 
top – the wealthy, the powerful 
– are the folks who are going to 

get the resources that could have 
guaranteed clean water for these 
kids.”
Dingell, along with several 
of the other speakers, brought 
attention to the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, a competition among 
the 14 Big Ten universities to 
get the highest student turnout 
rate on campus for the midterm 
elections.
LSA 
sophomore 
Marni 
Balamut attended the event in 
preparation for voting in the 
midterm election.
“Obviously with the midterms 
it’s so important to be voting and 
especially as young people, the 
policies of this presidency affects 
us so much,” Balamut said. “To 
be able to hear Congressmen and 
people really representing us talk 
to us as real people and telling us 
important issues and stuff from 
their experience is important.”
After the event, Lounds said 
she was happy with the student 
turnout, as well as the quality of 
speakers she was able to secure.
“We have such a force of 
Democratic 
power 
in 
the 
southeast side of the state,” 
Lounds said. “It’s awesome to get 
them all together and see what 
we can really do together.”

Professor 
Kristin 
Hass 
is 
currently teaching a course on 
Detroit and finds the increased 
programs and initiatives in 
Detroit exciting.
“We have a lot to learn from 
the history of the city and the 
people of the city,” Hass said. “I 
wouldn’t want to over-promise 
on the impact, (but) everybody 
aspires to have a positive impact 
on the city.”
Holloway said the goal for 
initiatives and programs is for 
the University and the city to 
mutually benefit. To further 
the productivity of programs, 
Holloway said local support is 
important. The University has 
300 projects grounded in and 
around Detroit.
“In order to accomplish our 
goals in relation to research 
and education, we have to do 
that with local support and 
local partners. We want to 
realize the reciprocal benefit, 
working with local partners. 
The dialogue is important.”
Underlying the University’s 
new ventures in Detroit is 
its pre-existing relationship 
with the city — or at times, a 
lack thereof. The University 
was founded in Detroit in 
1817, but departed for Ann 
Arbor two decades later. In 
the 
last 
half-century, 
city 
residents have lived through 
post-industrial 
decline, 

bankruptcy 
and 
population 
loss — and some members 
of the campus community 
question the motives behind 
the University’s partnerships. 
“There was a point at which 
my recommendation was that 
we pull out of Detroit altogether 
— that we didn’t really mean 
it,” former professor Martha 
Jones told The Daily last 
summer. “Now that was more 
of a provocation, but it’s not so 
far-fetched. That would be in 
keeping with one vision of who 
we are. As an institution, we’re 
very late in coming to Detroit...
we weren’t sure if we wanted 
to be a university that just 
happened to be in southeastern 
Michigan. A few years ago, I 
wound up doing a survey of 
all the programs in Detroit 
emanating from Ann Arbor, 
and there are scores of them. 
But after itemizing them, they 
didn’t really have one coherent 
mission or vision.”
In a similar vein, University 
alum 
Stephen 
Wallace 
criticized common research 
approaches to Detroit. Wallace, 
a 
Detroit 
native, 
sparked 
debate at a Ford School policy 
talk two years ago wherein a 
Detroit deputy mayor called 
the city a policy “laboratory.”
“I found that referring to 
Detroit as a laboratory for 
public 
policy 
experiments 
(was) very offensive because 
you’re dealing with people’s 
real lives,” Wallace pointed 
out. “I am very fortunate to 
come out of my neighborhood 

DETROIT

and go to one of the best schools 
in the world, but I had a lot of 
opportunities that some people 
don’t have and to refer to 
their lives and their futures as 
experiments … is a very slippery 
slope. It causes you to view 
the city and the people in it as 
something less than human.
University 
alum 
Michael 
Chrzan is a native of Detroit and 
now teaches math to Detroit high 
school students. He said when 
the programs are well developed, 
they can be valuable to the 
community.
“I’m a fan of large institutions 
doing work like this if it’s done 
in conscious ways, where there’s 
clear thought given on the impact 
on the community,” Chrzan said. 
“One of the big critiques I’ve 
heard of Michigan, especially 
the School of Ed, is that the work 
they do, they almost are using 
students as guinea pigs. It’s a fine 
line between research.”
He also stressed the University 
does try and balance research 
with understanding the students.
The P-20 Partnership is a 
program that Chrzan thinks is 
needed, emphasizing the idea 
of a teacher residency would be 
useful.
“The teacher residency was 
an idea they were trying to pilot 
when I was in a teaching intern 
program,” Chrzan said. “I was 
really excited to hear about 
that, we really need it in the 
profession.”
According to Holloway, the 
University operates under three 
principles when meeting with 

communities 
for 
dialogue: 
recognition, 
respect 
and 
equitable partnership.
“When we engage with a 
partner in Detroit, they’re giving 
us their time and their support, 
and we need to respect that,” 
Holloway said.
Hass agreed the University 
should approach Detroit with 
respect.
“I 
emphasize 
approaching 
the whole thing with humility,” 
Hass said. “Detroit as a city and 
the people of the city are not 
anybody’s laboratory. I think the 
presence of the University could 
be a wonderful thing.”
Chrzan mentioned growing 
up in east Detroit, he didn’t hear 
much from the University. Even 
today, he said the University 
might want to consider which 
regions they focus on and invest 
in.
“There are a lot of investments 
being made in northwest and 
western regions that I’m not 
hearing 
about 
in 
eastside 
neighborhoods, which gets into 
the crisis of ‘New Detroit,’” 
Chrzan said. “If the University 
isn’t careful they could wind up 
exacerbating things like that.”
As for the new space in the 
Rackham 
Memorial 
Building, 
Holloway said the University 
could use the new area for 
classrooms 
and 
community 
dialogue.
“The purchase of the Rackham 
Building is part of a statement 
really from the University that 
we think we have a long-term 
engagement with Detroit.”

Washtenaw County
Commissioners 
will consider first 
salary raise since 
2013 vote 

Elected officials to vote on new bill 
proposing 70 percent salary raise to 
bring average wage to $27,056/year 

The 
Ways 
and 
Means 
committee 
of 
the 
Washtenaw County Board of 
Commissioners discussed a 
salary raise Wednesday night. 
The nine elected officials 
currently make an average of 
$15,911 per year—under the 
new proposal, these wages 
could rise to $27,056 over 
the next two years. Though 
The Daily could not confirm 
whether the measure was 
voted on Wednesday night, 
the proposed salaries would 
represent close to a 70 percent 
increase.The measure seeks 
to pay the commissioners—
who serve in their capacities 
part-time—45 percent of the 
median income in Washtenaw 
County. 
County 
Board 
Chairman Andy LaBarre (D) 
told MLive he expects the 
raises to pass with most of the 
board’s support. 

“This is certainly a job 
where, if you’re looking to do 
it right, it can come to a half-
time commitment, sometimes 
even 
more 
if 
you’re 
in 
leadership,” he said. “But 
right now, the wage we pay I 
think sort of produces a board 
that either has folks who are 
no longer in the workforce, 
folks who are maybe students 
or have a non-traditional 
setup, or some folks, if they 
have 
full-time 
jobs, 
they 
either have to have a lot of 
flexibility in those jobs or 
they’re not able to do as much 
as other commissioners.”
The 
average 
wage 
for 
county commissioners in the 
state of Michigan is currently 
$18,700. 
The 
board 
last 
made 
headlines for unanimuously 
adopting a racial equity policy 
earlier this month. The salary 
measures will go before the 
entire board for confirmation 
on Oct. 3.

that’s built into corrections,” he 
said. “Even though it’s called 
corrections, there is a bias to 
keep you illiterate, to keep you 
at a remedial level, and it takes 
a village to get former inmates 
back into society.”
When Sanders was released, 
he 
was 
helped 
by 
several 
University of Michigan and 
Wayne State University social 
work interns as well as his sisters 
to get a state identification 
card and health insurance, in 
addition to completing other 
re-entry regulatory steps. He 
claimed one of his proudest 
accomplishments since prison 
was registering and later voting 
for 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Abdul El-Sayed.
“This 
is 
very 
important 
for you guys: Determine your 
own fate, and don’t do it just 
after the primary, do it so you 
aren’t left with someone that 
somebody else picked for you,” 
he said. “The same day I got out 
of prison, being there for almost 
43 years, first thing I did was 
register to vote. And I went with 
Abdul.”
Sanders’ 
transition 
back 
into society was a difficult 
one, especially in terms of 
finding work. He was hired at 
McDonald’s after a successful 
interview, when his status as a 
former felon wasn’t mentioned 
until the end. He hopes to 
contribute to the field of social 
work or law in the future. 
Sanders mentioned Gov. Rick 

Snyder’s ban on the checkbox 
designating former felons on job 
applications as an institutional 
step in the right direction.
Sanders received help from 
the 
Unviersity’s 
Information 
Alliance 
for 
Community 
Development, which he said 
was essential to gaining fluency 
in digital work applications and 
general technological skills.
Rackham 
student 
Ihudiya 
Ogburu 
researches 
digital 
literacy 
in 
the 
School 
of 
Information, 
and 
described 
the effort of this organization 
and why she felt compelled to 
spearhead the program.
“I’m 
interested 
in 
understanding how returning 
citizens or people who were 
formerly 
incarcerated 
use 
technology in general, and how 
they go about looking for jobs 
in this digital society,” she said. 
“We just finished interviewing 
last week, it’s on Sundays from 
2:00 to 5:00 pm, and we want to 
further recruit volunteers.”
Graduate 
student 
Yixian 
Zhou explained her interest 
in 
the 
transitionary 
period 
between 
incarceration 
and 
returning to society brought her 
to the lecture.
“The reason why I came here 
is that I’m curious about this 
topic — there are a few topics 
about how when people came 
from prison, and how people 
transition and adapt into normal 
life. This is a completely different 
life than in prison. I’m curious 
about that, and also how people 
handle mental health issues 
and change their thoughts and 
conceptions to adapt to society.”

O

n Sept. 14, incumbent 
Andrew 
Cuomo 
defeated 
progressive 
challenger and Emmy award-
winning actress Cynthia Nixon 
in the New York gubernatorial 
Democratic primary election, 
garnering nearly two-thirds 
of the total vote. This was by 
no means a shocking result. 
The RealClearPolitics polling 
average projected Cuomo to 
win by 38.5 percent — his 
actual margin of victory was 
about 31.2 percent. Despite 
Nixon technically exceeding 
expectations, a Cuomo victory 
unfortunately 
seemed 
from 
the outset like a foregone 
conclusion.
Nixon’s loss was portrayed 
as 
a 
huge 
blow 
to 
the 
progressive movement in the 
mainstream 
media 
— 
and 
they’re not entirely wrong. 
Of course, she ran to win and 
that did not happen. However, 
to assert her candidacy was 
totally in vain because of this 
reality is to fail to understand 
the extent of her impact and 
political footprint.
The same night of Nixon’s 
election loss, six progressive 
candidates were able to topple 
Independent 
Democratic 
Conference incumbents in New 
York state Senate primaries. 
These 
corporatist, 
out-of-
touch, so-called “Democrats” 
were given a wake-up call 
and a taste of where the base 
is at these days. They are 
tired of Republican-lite. The 
progressives 
won 
because 
people want real, substantive, 
positive change.
They also won because of 
Nixon. Though she was not able 
to secure victory in her race, 
she served as the flagbearer 
for progressivism in New York 
this primary season. In doing 
so, she was able to change the 
state’s political landscape. Her 
influence is largely to thank for 
these state Senate victories.
Nixon, giving a celebrity 
platform to this policy set, 
helped to double voter turnout. 
It also served as the extra push 
needed to carry down-ballot 
progressives to victory. Also, 
in what became dubbed the 
“Cynthia Effect,” she was able 
to persuade Cuomo to adopt 
elements of her platform that 

he previously opposed.
Seeing the immense energy 
Nixon was raising among base 
members, Cuomo saw no choice 
but to try to steal her cadence 
in order to maintain stamina. 
For example, despite standing 
firmly against it during his 
entire political career, Cuomo 
came out in favor of legalizing 
marijuana this election cycle 
— a position held not just by 
Nixon but also by about two-
thirds of all Americans.
Criminal 
justice 
reform 

was one of the focus points 
of 
Nixon’s 
campaign. 
Her 
platform included ending cash 
bail, solitary confinement and 
the prosecution of children 
as adults. In response, Cuomo 
announced a plan of his own 
to restore voting rights to 
parolees.
Though 
Cuomo 
doesn’t 
go nearly as far as she does, 
Nixon’s bold policy proposals 
did, 
in 
fact, 
pull 
Cuomo 
leftward. By being principled 
and steadfast, Nixon forced 
Cuomo to meet her in the 
middle. Keep doing this and 
what is now referred to as “the 
insurgency” will become the 
new mainstream.
We 
saw 
similar 
thing 
instances 
occur 
with 
Abdul 
El-Sayed’s 
Michigan 
gubernatorial 
campaign. 
Though he was unable to clinch 
the Democratic nomination, 
his candidacy still had an effect 
insofar as moving the party 
leftward. In response to the 
energy stirred up by El-Sayed’s 
campaign, Gretchen Whitmer, 
the establishment candidate 
and eventual nominee, chose 
solid 
progressive 
Garlin 
Gilchrist II as her running 
mate. Let us not mince words: 
Had El-Sayed not run, this pick 
would not have happened.

El-Sayed was also extremely 
popular with young people. His 
campaign had a huge presence 
on college campuses throughout 
the 
state. 
He 
successfully 
mobilized the next generation of 
voters and was able to introduce 
a traditionally apathetic age 
group into the political process.
There are countless other 
examples of “failed” progressive 
campaigns 
that 
nonetheless 
had a positive impact on the 
race as a whole. There are also 
now 
countless 
examples 
of 
progressive wins — New York 
House 
candidate 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan House 
candidate Rashida Tlaib and 
Flordia gubernatorial candidate 
Andrew 
Gillum 
are 
just 
a 
handful that come to mind. 
These wins should not come as 
a surprise.
Simply 
put, 
progressive 
ideas are popular. For example, 
70 
percent 
of 
Americans 
support Medicare for all and 
66 percent support raising the 
minimum wage to $10.10 per 
hour. This is populism in the 
truest sense of the word.
Losing is never easy, but 
progressives need to come to 
grips with the fact that they are 
not the establishment. Though 
they 
have 
made 
fantastic 
strides over the past few years, 
this is still a movement in 
the building phase. Failures 
and obstacles are inevitable, 
but any progressive run for 
office, regardless of electoral 
success, is an act of moving 
the Democratic Party in the 
right direction — away from 
corporatism 
and 
toward 
fulfilling the will of the masses.
The point in all of this is to 
say to progressives that, if you 
are considering running for 
office, do it. While electoral 
success is clearly the intended 
goal, do not let the thought of 
losing discourage you. To run, 
regardless 
of 
the 
outcome, 
is 
to 
do 
the 
movement, 
and 
more 
importantly 
the 
country, an immense service.
to do the movement, and more 
importantly the country, an 
immense service.

The case for vegan pumpkin spice
I 
 

always 
try 
to 
write 
my 
column 
with 
the 
utmost 
composure 
and 
professionalism, 
but 
today 
I 
just 
can’t 
do 
that. 
It’s 
late 
September, 
we’re 
approaching 
week four of college 
football season, the 
trees are bound to 
start shedding their 
leaves any moment 
now. 
If 
you 
can’t 
guess it already, I 
want a pumpkin spice 
latte! What’s the point of fall if 
you can’t have a PSL?
To summarize the above 
rant: Starbucks, bring vegan 
pumpkin spice lattes to the 
United 
States. 
Please. 
I’m 
begging you.
For those of you who choose 
to spend your time focusing on 
more substantive global issues, 
I’ll give you the rundown. 
In early 2003, a small team 
gathered 
in 
the 
Starbucks 
“Liquid Lab” sampling forkfuls 
of pumpkin pie and sips of 
espresso. In that fateful room, 
the Pumpkin Spice Latte was 
born, the drink that has come 
to embody crisp leaves, cozy 
sweaters and all things fall.
Part of the perfection of 
this recipe, however, was the 
pumpkin spice sauce. Most 
Starbucks flavored lattes, such 
as vanilla lattes and caramel 
macchiatos, involve a syrup. 
These syrups are completely 
dairy-free, so most drinks at 
Starbucks can easily be made 
vegan by swapping out the 
dairy milk for almond milk, 
soy milk or coconut milk. 
Even their mochas and hot 
chocolates can be made vegan 
using this method! This has 
made 
Starbucks 
a 
popular 
destination for vegans and 
dairy intolerant customers for 
a long time.
However, 
the 
pumpkin 
spice latte uses a sauce instead 

of a syrup, which supposedly 
makes 
it 
heavier, 
like 
a 
mouthful of pumpkin pie. This 
sauce 
contains 
condensed 
skim 
milk, 
meaning 
even if a dairy-free 
customer asks for 
a 
pumpkin 
spice 
latte with soy milk 
instead 
of 
dairy 
milk, 
the 
drink 
will still contain 
dairy in the sauce. 
Essentially, 
it’s 
impossible 
for 
a 
customer to order a dairy-free 
version of this drink.
In 2003, when the drink 
debuted, the dairy ingredient 
may not have posed a problem. 
However, in the past 15 years, 
our 
culture 
has 
changed 
drastically. The overall dairy 
alternatives 
market 
was 
estimated at about $7.4 billion 
in 2016 and is projected to 
extend to about $14.4 billion 
by 
2022, 
increasing 
at 
a 
compound annual growth rate 
of 11.7 percent. In addition, 
sales of total conventional 
fluid milk products decreased 
6.2 percent from 2016 to 2017, 
and estimated sales of total 
organic fluid milk products 
decreased 5.6 percent from 
a year earlier. Basically, the 
market is begging for milk 
alternatives.
To understand just how 
milk-averse our culture is 
becoming, look at the non-
dairy 
ice 
cream 
industry. 
When I stopped consuming 
dairy in 2015, I was hard-
pressed to find ice cream to 
eat. I could find dairy-free 
sorbet 
pretty 
easily, 
and 
certain health brands carried 
dairy-free 
products 
that 
were called “ice cream” but 
tasted certainly didn’t like 
it. That was about it. Today, 
I’m amazed by how large 
the market has grown. I can 
walk into Meijer and find 

almost every ice cream brand 
in the store has at least a few 
flavors that don’t contain 
dairy. 
Likewise, 
most 
ice 
cream parlors in downtown 
Ann Arbor and even in the 
small towns I’ve visited carry 
some non-dairy options. Most 
importantly, it tastes like 
ice cream. My friends who 
still consume dairy (though 
they are becoming rarer and 
rarer) admit they can’t taste 
the difference between dairy 
ice cream and non-dairy ice 
cream.
In 2013, someone started a 
petition called “Please Make 
The Pumpkin Spice Latte 
Vegan.” This petition, which 
is now closed, has 11,631 
supporters. Five years ago, 
before the vegan craze hit 
our culture, there was a clear 
demand for vegan pumpkin 
spice lattes.
Progress is being made, 
let’s 
be 
clear. 
This 
year 
Starbucks announced vegan 
pumpkin spice lattes would be 
made available across several 
European countries. This is 
great news, but I have two 
major problems with it. The 
first problem is I don’t live in 
Europe. The second problem 
is North America is projected 
has the fastest growing non-
dairy market. Why is Europe 
the go-to location to launch 
vegan pumpkin spice lattes?
This 
fall, 
I 
have 
two 
wishes. The first is for the 
University of Michigan to 
beat Ohio State University, 
and the second is to enjoy a 
Pumpkin Spice Latte. One of 
these goals should be easily 
attainable if the right people 
decide they want to make it 
happen. To the team at the 
Starbucks Liquid Lab: Are 
you listening?

Not all is lost

The Accountable Capitalism Act could go further

ERIK NESLER | COLUMN

A 

little over a month ago, 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., 
introduced 
the Accountable Capitalism Act 
to Congress. The introduction 
of the bill made tidal waves in 
the media after she described 
its purpose in an eye-opening 
Op-Ed published by the Wall 
Street Journal.
Warren used the Op-Ed to 
write about the stark wealth 
inequality 
throughout 
the 
United 
States. 
She 
claims 
(rightly so) the private sector has 
directly caused and perpetuated 
this inequality by always acting 
to maximize shareholder returns 
— an idea made famous by 
conservative economist Milton 
Friedman in the 1970s.
This idea that companies 
exist 
solely 
to 
maximize 
shareholder returns has had 
drastic effects on the broader 
economy. Warren includes in 
her piece that between 2007 and 
2016, U.S. corporations dedicated 
93 percent of their earnings 
to shareholders. This transfer 
of wealth further exacerbates 
economic inequity when you 
consider that the wealthiest 10 
percent of U.S. households own 
the vast majority (84 percent) of 
American-held shares.
In addition, Warren writes 
real wages have not realized 
relative increases since this 
ideology took hold in the late 
20th century. Companies have 
chosen to dedicate less and 
less of their earnings to their 
employees through pay raises — 
instead choosing to distribute 
wealth to shareholders in the 
form of dividends and share buy-
backs.
Warren, fed up with this 
unjust state of affairs, devised 
a solution. Corporations with 
more than $1 billion in annual 
revenue would be required to 
get a federal corporate charter 
in addition to having a corporate 
charter in the state where the 
entity is incorporated. The new 
charter would require directors 
to consider the interests of all 
major corporate stakeholders 
when making major strategic 
decisions. Directors would be 
allowed to choose alternatives 
(without fear of litigation) that 
can potentially destroy value 
— like choosing to allocate 
earnings 
toward 
expanding 
employee benefits or toward 
some philanthropic venture.
She also wants employees 
to elect at least 40 percent of 

a company’s directors. This 
would certainly give employees, 
a stakeholder group that have 
been historically marginalized 
and forgotten, a stronger voice 
in the decision-making process 
companies must go through.
Warren’s 
proposed 
alterations to the way companies 
conduct 
themselves 
would 
make them more similar to B 
Corporations. B Corporations 
are for-profit companies that 
are “legally required to consider 
the impact of their decisions 
on their workers, customers, 
suppliers, 
community, 
and 
the environment.” Businesses 
can act with itheir conscience 
without fear of repercussions 
from their shareholders.

One of the most famous B 
Corporations is Warby Parker, 
the eyeglass-maker that donates 
a pair of glasses to those in 
need 
with 
every 
purchase 
and maintains carbon-neutral 
production 
and 
distribution 
activities. 
Warby 
Parker’s 
co-founder Neil Blumenthal told 
James Surowiecki of The New 
Yorker, “We wanted to build 
a business that could make 
profits. But we also wanted to 
build a business that did good 
in 
the 
world.” 
Blumenthal 
continued, “Your ability to have 
an impact on a large scale is just 
greater in the for-profit world, 
and that’s chiefly because of the 
capital and the talent available 
to you.”
Considering Warby Parker’s 
immense success in the past 
couple of years, it’s clear that 
businesses can pursue profit 
while 
positively 
impacting 
society. As Blumenthal put it, 
the private sector (as opposed 
to the public sector) has the 
capacity and potential to be a 
force for good in our economy.
As I read through Warren’s 
Op-Ed and learned more about 
B 
Corporations, 
I 
couldn’t 
help but think of “A World of 
Three Zeros” by Muhammad 

Yunus — a book that I read this 
summer. Yunus, like Warren, is 
concerned with the increasing 
wealth 
concentration. 
He 
writes on its risk to society as a 
whole: “(wealth concentration) 
threatens 
human 
progress, 
social cohesion, human rights, 
and democracy.” As the wealth 
gap 
grows, 
dissatisfaction 
among 
society 
inevitably 
deepens.
Yunus agrees with Warren 
that capitalism — specifically 
the idea that companies must 
maximize shareholder value — 
has led to the wealth disparity 
experienced 
throughout 
the 
world. He devises a different 
solution, however.
Yunus 
proposes 
entrepreneurs 
create 
social 
businesses 
— 
non-dividend 
companies 
dedicated 
to 
solving human problems. His 
book 
discusses 
the 
various 
businesses he’s started that 
provide goods or services which 
benefit those most in need. 
He writes extensively about 
Grameen Bank, the bank he 
founded to provide micro loans 
(loans usually less than $100) 
to impoverished villagers in 
Bangladesh.
Social 
businesses 
are 
unique because directors can 
operate and make strategic 
decisions without the burden 
of being required to maximize 
shareholder wealth. Investors 
who 
provide 
capital 
to 
entrepreneurs starting these 
businesses are able to get back 
their initial investments (with a 
given rate of return accounting 
for the time value of money), 
but nothing more. Any profits 
generated by the business are 
kept within the firm — either 
given to employees or used to 
expand the firm’s reach.
Yunus’ 
social 
business 
concept may seem farfetched 
and 
radical 
now, 
but 
the 
idea could (and should) be 
commonplace in the future. The 
private sector should be able 
to produce handsome profits 
without making the rich richer.
While Warren’s Accountable 
Capitalism Act is a step in the 
right direction, I believe the 
private 
sector 
should 
take 
more drastic action (ideally on 
their own) toward remedying 
the devastating wealth gap in 
today’s society.

I have always considered myself 

a well-versed feminist. I have read 
Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine 
Mystique” 
and 
Kate 
Millett’s 

“Sexual Politics.” I point out toxic 
masculinity when I see fit, empower 
women as my go-to hobby and, 
the cherry on top, I am a Women’s 
Studies major.

But no feminist text or practice 

could prepare my modern-day 
feminist brain for Simone De 
Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex”: A 
psychoanalytic-existential 
hybrid 

that evaluates every angle of the 
female experience and humanity’s 
placement of women in relation to 
men.

Beauvoir’s feminist prose doesn’t 

just “go off,” it goes in — into the 
depths of the reader’s hard drive to 
rewire our preconceived notions 
of marriage, sex, menstruation 
and so forth. “The Second Sex” 
is 
the 
feminist 
encyclopedia 

that 
encompasses 
psychology, 

philosophy, biology, literature, law, 
traditions and ethics.

On a surface level Beauvoir’s 

standout 
progressive 
proposals, 

like her praise of open sexual 
relationships as the key to free 
love, may seem extreme to readers; 
however, Beauvoir may be playing 
with deeper psychological and 
social truths that many are not 
ready to admit because it’s not 
always easy. It’s not always easy 
to understand that marriage may 
be an oppressive institution that 
diminishes love or that women are 
confined to inferiority and men 
superiority.

On the other
Today I see physical signs of 

progress for women as they march 
through the streets equipped with 
signs demanding their liberation, 
computers 
across 
campus 
are 

adorned with “GRL PWR” stickers. 
And yet, women today are largely 
underrepresented, underpaid and 
without equal rights or authority to 
that of men. Beauvoir’s reasoning 
for this is as follows: “women have 
never formed an autonomous and 
closed society; they are integrated 
into the group governed by males, 
where they occupy a subordinate 
position.” Through man’s work 
and achievement he can progress 
further into the world while a 
“woman’s own successes are in 
contradiction with her femininity.” 
Women can bind together to create 
a 
“counter-universe” 
but 
they 

still cannot avoid the masculine 
universe by which they are forced to 
frame it. Beauvoir describes this as 
the paradox of the female situation: 
“Women belong both to the male 
world and to a sphere in which this 
world is challenged; enclosed in this 
sphere involved in the male world, 
they cannot peacefully establish 
themselves anywhere.” And these 
spheres grow tighter and tighter 
within marginalized groups of 
women based on sexual orientation, 
race or otherwise.

Beauvoir describes the feminist 

urgency to eradicate the patriarchy 
as “halfway between revolt and 
slavery.” We see the light at the end 
of the tunnel to women’s liberation 
but we lack the means to get there 
because we are the Other. Men 
today may include women and call 
us their “peer” but only as long as we 
remain “inessential,” as Beauvoir 
writes. For centuries women have 
been marginalized, silenced and 
othered by the masculine code 
society abides by.

And yet, as a woman of today, I 

am still othered. I am othered as 
soon as I step out into the world 
and am hit with the starving eyes 
of men or even worse derogatory 
“catcalls” that single me out in 
the street, making me aware 
that I am different. I become 
an object of desire. I am othered 
when I am told to cross my legs 
or cover my shoulders, while the 
boy sitting next to me in lecture 
spreads his legs wide apart without 
assessment of his body from the 
outside world. I am othered when 
people anticipate my future as a 
mother or wife based on my gender 
instead of future employer or goal-
setter. And as much as I feel I am 
othered as a woman today, my 
oppression doesn’t compare or 
even reflect that of women with 
different 
socioeconomic 
and/or 

racial status who are significantly 
more marginalized by society than 
myself.

On marriage and motherhood
Beauvoir casts off marriage 

as a mechanism that ruins love 
through the boredom of habituality, 
essentially 
diminishing 
the 

female’s individualized and free 
self. Beauvoir argues that because 
married women feel a deep sense of 
unfulfillment from her secondary 
place in public and private spheres 
she 
desperately 
turns 
toward 

motherhood to fill the abyss that 
is herself. The mother becomes 
devoted, enslaved by her vocation to 
the child only to be devastated when 
the child denies her throughout 
maturation. In Beauvoir’s words, 
“Maternity is a strange compromise 
of narcissism, altruism, dream, 
sincerity, bad faith, devotion and 
cynicism.”

These 
ideals 
of 
Beauvoir’s 

are most critiqued as absurd 

and outdated, but I find them 
to be brilliantly audacious and 
interrogative. 
I 
recognize 
my 

mother’s irrational outbursts of 
anger, affection and bitterness as 
results of my deviation from her 
overbearing grips. I cannot berate 
motherhood or marriage for other 
women, but we should scrutinize 
the idea that motherhood, and the 
roles we attach with it, are natural 
for women.

On the housewife
It may seem outdated when 

Beauvoir addresses the oppression 
of the housewife as so many women 
today are receiving educations 
equal or greater to that of men and 
dispensing themselves throughout 
the workforce. Yet, there remains 
a significant gap between men and 
women partaking in household 
affairs. Polls reveal that working 
men overwhelmingly desire full 
time jobs while women with the 

highest earning potential preferred 
part time work by a 51 to 19 percent 
margin. In 1985 it was surveyed that 
only 10 percent of women said that 
husbands should turn down good 
employment in another city so the 
wife could continue working. In 
2014 a study on Harvard Business 
School graduates found that 40 
percent of Gen X and boomer 
women said their spouse’s careers 
took precedence over theirs, and 70 
percent of the men studied agreed. 
These studies reveal that women 
still hold the importance of their 
husband’s career above their own, 
and work at significantly lower rates 
to ensure time is retained for home 
centered duties. Despite how many 
hours a woman dedicates to her job, 
when she comes home, the majority 
of housekeeping and childcare 
are largely placed on the woman’s 
shoulders. This is a routine we may 
witness countless times in our life: 

Our mothers come home from work 
straight into the kitchen to clean 
and cook, while our fathers hang 
to the side letting gendered roles 
excuse their incompetence. This is 
not meant to say whether being a 
mother or housewife is good or bad, 
but rather to challenge and critique 
the way gendered roles influence 
women’s inferior place in society.

The 
economic 
and 
social 

inequality that favors privileged 
people isolate women on an island of 
inferiority that becomes an obstacle 
of her essence. A woman must 
first overcome the fact that she is a 
woman before she can move about in 
the world as a free agent. According 
to Beauvoir, “she needs to expand a 
greater moral effort than the male to 
choose the path of independence.” 
In bed, in kitchens, in workplaces: 
the woman still remains the Other, 
the secondary. Where and when can 
she be first and the only?

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

It has been some time since 

the name Norm Macdonald was 
relevant in the world of comedy. 
The veteran comic left “Saturday 
Night Live” in 1999 and since 
then has shown up on various 

talk shows and specials hosted by 
more contemporary comics. In 
2014, Macdonald unsuccessfully 
campaigned to be Craig Ferguson’s 
successor on “The Late Late Show.” 
Macdonald was once a prominent 
face in comedy, thought of as one 
of the great SNL cast members and 
perhaps the best “Weekend Update” 
host of all time. Now, he’s trying to 
reclaim that fame, with the sad 
attempt at relevance that is Netflix’s 
“Norm Macdonald Has a Show.”

“Norm Macdonald Has a Show” 

seeks to offer a laid-back alternative 
to the politicized, scripted talk 

shows that dominate airwaves. 
Each show starts with guests, 
including 
David 
Spade, 
Drew 

Barrymore and David Letterman, 
who are guided on set by staff and 
seated next to Macdonald. There is 
no monologue, no opening music, no 
sense of preparedness; guests come 
to offer career anecdotes and shoot 
the breeze with a seasoned comic.

This lack of preparation might be 

intentional, perhaps meant to add an 
endearing element to the otherwise 
dry show. Instead, it makes for an 
incredibly uncomfortable half an 
hour, leaving the viewers, guests and 
even Macdonald confused at what 
it is they are watching and taking 
part in. There are multiple lulls 
throughout the show, where neither 
Macdonald nor his guest quite 
know what to say. At one point in 
the premiere episode, David Spade 
asks Macdonald if he wants him to 
come back next week. It’s meant as 
a joke, but Spade’s recognition of the 
feeling of incompleteness isn’t far 
off. The deconstructed nature of the 
show falls flat, and feels more like 
an unfinished production that was 
rushed to air.

It doesn’t help that just a week 

before the show was released 
on Netflix, Macdonald gave a 
controversial interview in which he 

discussed the downfall of two of his 
friends, Louis C.K. and Roseanne 

Barr. Macdonald was quoted 

saying that the victims of Barr and 
C.K.’s actions and words “didn’t 
have to go through” the shame 
and backlash the performers did. 
His attempt to apologize on “The 
Howard Stern Show” just made 
matters worse, as he claimed that 
to lack sympathy for sexual assault 
victims, one would have to “have 
Down’s Syndrome.”

These horrific comments cast a 

shadow over an already lackluster 
show, but they embody the essence 
of Macdonald’s routine. “Norm 
Macdonald Has a Show” has the 
aura of a group of lonely dads 
sitting in a basement, drinking 
a couple beers and wondering 
where the good ol’ days went. It’s 
not funny enough to make up for 
the visible lack of preparation nor 
is it innovative enough to make 
up for the apparent lack of care. 
Macdonald and Netflix may be 
trying to conjure comedic nostalgia 
with the former SNL cast member’s 
return to center stage, but there is 
a reason the world of comedy has 
moved on from Norm Macdonald. 
One can only wish he would stop 
making attempts to claw his way 
back in.

‘Norm Macdonald Has a 
Show’ but someone should 
take it away

TV REVIEW

For half a decade, Lana Del 

Rey has been working on a 
fully realized fantasy for her 
listeners. The extravagance and 
excess ambition of Born to Die 
fed directly into the selfishness 
and moodiness of Ultraviolence, 
which led to the simultaneously 
sedated and anxious Honeymoon. 
2017’s Lust for Life felt like a clear 

departure from the iterative sad-
girl personas Del Rey donned 
every year or two. A smile and 
a few deliberate, happy (by her 
standards) songs were all it 
took. What Lust for Life really 
meant, though, was that Del Rey 
had fulfilled some sort of deep 
creative niche for herself. There 
was no longer a need to languish 
in that dangerous living-fast-and-
dying-pretty feeling that defined 
some of her classics: “Ride,” 
“West Coast,” “Florida Kilos” 
and “Honeymoon,” for example. 
Instead, Del Rey cultivated an 
inner strength and purpose. Songs 
like “High by the Beach” exemplify 

the cool self-assuredness that 
has developed, while “Love” and 
new track “Mariners Apartment 
Complex” 
demonstrate 
her 

willingness to share her strength. 
Del Rey recently announced her 
fifth major-label record Norman 
Fucking Rockwell, due out in 2019, 
and monolithic new single “Venice 
Bitch” pushes Del Rey’s evolution 
even further forward.

“Venice Bitch” opens with 

verses 
that 
have 
become 

increasingly abbreviated as Del 
Rey’s lyrical language has evolved: 
“Fear fun, fear love, / Fresh out of 
fucks, forever.” It’s a couplet that is 
almost comic in its alliteration and 
semi-serious usage of “fresh out of 
fucks.” The words wouldn’t make 
sense coming from the mouth of 
anyone else. The rest of the first 
few minutes feel like a traditional 
Lana love song, as she begs “Oh 
God, miss you on my lips” and 
“One dream, one life, one lover,” 
but the song patiently opens 
into a 9’36’’ expanse of pining 
and cooing for love. An anxious, 
warbling synth steals the melody 
from the fingerpicked guitar in 
the beginning, followed by guitar 
and drum feedback, until Del 
Rey asserts herself over the track 
once more, repeating “Crimson 
and clover, honey” and “Over and 
over, honey.” The short lines are 
not only a reference to the 1968 
song “Crimson and Clover” by 

Tommy James and the Shondells, 
but also another demonstration 
of Del Rey’s ability to weave the 
perfect cultural reference into 

her work. Over the years, Del 
Rey has created an impressive 
musical 
vocabulary, 
at 
once 

vintage and totally her own, that 
has commanded the attention of 
millions for a few years. “Venice 
Bitch” is an absolute flex of a single 
that proves that Del Rey knows 
exactly what she’s doing — and 
that she isn’t doing it for anybody 
but herself.

‘Venice Bitch’ is a sweet 
Southern Calif. expanse

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Thursday, September 20, 2018

I don’t remember when I began 

stanning Nicki Minaj. However, 
I do remember memorizing her 
verse off Trey Songz’s “Bottoms 
Up” in middle school. Not far 
from when I ran on the treadmill 
in my parents’ basement with 
“Superbass” 
coming 
through 

my headphones — the girl I had 
a crush on at the time loved it so 
I wanted to seem with it. I can 
picture an old high school friend 
running, jumping and singing to 
“Starships” at a student council 
conference. 
After 
getting 
my 

license sophomore year, I would 
visit my sister at Grand Valley State 
(about a two-hour drive from my 
parents’) and on one trip I came 
across “Va Va Voom” — another 
Pink Friday: Reloaded-era song — 
which has a flow to its booming 
chorus that gives the impression it 
has been heard before. Not that it 
is unoriginal, but that its emotive, 
infectious sound is one that we 
shouldn’t be without. In my head, 
it’s the B-side to “Pound the Alarm,” 
which I recall playing at my junior-
year homecoming. I asked my date, 
“What song is this?” and she was 
appalled that I didn’t know. Either 
way we had our first kiss that night 
on the sweaty, stanky public school 
cafeteria 
dancefloor. 
“Roman’s 

Revenge” left me comfortable 
using the word “cunt,” to my 
mother’s dissatisfaction.

But it was in 2014, with 

“Anaconda” and The Pinkprint, that 
my relationship to Minaj’s music 
became less perfunctory and more 
proactive. Everyone remembers 
the music video so I don’t need to 
go into detail, but the combination 
of the verses’ sharp and slick 
delivery and the unapologetic love 
for having a fat ass was a pivotal 
moment in pop culture and hip hop. 
It’s an era that feels both historical 
and present, as Nicki Minaj has 
ridden The Pinkprint’s success (in 
terms of critical response, sales 
and singles) for nearly four years, 
having released her follow-up 
album Queen last month, if you 
hadn’t heard.

Stanning is time-consuming, 

especially depending on who you 
stan. Stanning a punk-rock band 
like The Wonder Years as my 
friend Dominic has done for years, 
requires time and endurance to 
keep up with constant touring. 
Stanning Britney Spears, as my 
old roommate does, requires the 
exhaustive task of maintaining 
her relevance without falling back 
completely on her 2000-2010 
success. Stanning is continuous, 
evolutionary. 
It 
creates 
a 

community: The Beyhive, The 
Navy, Swifties, Directioners … you 
get the idea. A key distinction to 
be made is the incompatibility of 
stanning a problematic fave, which 
is where my devotion to Minaj 
began to crumble.

I saw her tour in support of 

The Pinkprint the summer of 
2015 and was so disappointed. A 
slew of aspects including flow, 
choreography, vocal performance 
and setlist choices left the show 
with an uneven energy that 
contradicted the woman at its 
center. Still, I teared up as she 
professed personal history in tour 
and album opener “All Things 
Go.” This may have been a case of 
excessive expectation on my part 
and my inner devotion to Minaj 
dwindled slightly, as I figured I 
most likely wouldn’t go see her live 
again. The price-to-payout ratio 
just didn’t seem there.

Fast-forward to Oct. 2016. I 

stan Beyoncé, and because I’m not 
fake, I have a Tidal account. Sorry 
not sorry, but I can’t risk being 
even a minute late to whatever 
the Queen B is up to. Nonetheless, 
Tidal has a handful of other cool 
features, 
including 
artist-made 

playlists, 
exclusive 
interviews, 

album-films and live streams/
recordings of Tidal charity shows 
and Budweiser’s Made in America 
Festival, headlined by Beyoncé in 
2015, Rihanna in 2016 and Nicki 
in 2018. Tidal’s annual charity 
show in Brooklyn offers quick sets 
from a stacked lineup of artists 
and, in 2016, Minaj sold me on 
her performing abilities during 
her 20-some-odd-minute set as 
she barreled through verses from 
“Roman’s Revenge,” “Monster,” 
“Down in the DM,” the “Pinkprint 
Freestyle,” “Chi-Raq” and “Only,” 
among others. With minimal back 

tracks, her MC skills were front-
and-center, delivering her bars 
with equal parts ease and attitude. 
Furthermore, 
the 
transitions 

between tracks kept the energy 
going and the crowd on their toes. 
At this point my stanhood was 
back in full swing, just in time for 
the rapper to litter the following 
year with spotlight-stealing guest 
spots on tracks from Gucci Mane, 
Lil Uzi, A$AP Ferg, Future, Fergie, 
Katy Perry and more.

Following her feature on “Make 

Love” by Gucci (which dropped 
just in time for my Mardi Gras trip 
to New Orleans), Remy Ma released 
“ShEther,” which displayed the 
bars and bravado of Nicki’s TidalX 
performance over the course of six 
minutes, all the while accusing the 
rapper of plastic surgery, signing 
a 360, supporting her pedophile 
brother and doing cocaine. Nicki 
came back with her “Three Pack 
from Paris,” in which “No Frauds” 
was positioned as her response, 
but with time-consuming features 
from Drake and Lil Wayne, it felt 
less like a headshot and more like 
a flex.

As 2017 passed, Remy faded 

again 
and 
Nicki 
remained 

prevalent by way of her features. 
Features that largely distracted 
from the fact we were going on year 
three without a proper Pinkprint 
follow-up. There were rumblings, 
there were teases and with each 
passing season, the stakes seemed 
higher and higher. The sense of 
drag, in my experience, was only 
outmatched by the waiting period 
for Frank Ocean’s Blonde and every 
Beyoncé project ever since 2013’s 
surprise, eponymous album.

Finally, Nicki announces Queen 

via her twitter, slated for a Jun. 
release, which was quickly pushed 
back to Aug. (I assume this was 
due to a tip from Camp Carter that 
Everything is Love was coming 
that week). It was within those 
two months my devotion, amongst 
others, 
started 
to 
dissipate. 

Something I believe Nicki herself 
can feel. I mean, she tweeted about 
#Queen every day between the 
first release date and the actual one 
and still only grabbed the number 
two spot, and we all know how 
she feels about that. This palpable 
sense of insecurity permeates 
through Minaj’s twitter, maybe due 
to natural mid-career crisis tingz, 
or a response to the threat of Cardi 
B, who is one of the few women 
rappers to find lasting popularity 
in a post-Pink Friday rap landscape.

Her presence, amplified by 

Queen Radio on Apple Music, 
comes off as someone who is 
yelling the loudest to cover up 
the fact they don’t have much to 
say. She has stated the majority of 
Queen was recorded the week of 
its release and my initial response 
to that was, “Ooff it sounds like 
it.” It’s a dense record at 19 tracks, 
with more than a few skips. It 
hardly sounds as if it has been four 
years in the making, or helmed by 
a lyricist/rapper of Minaj’s caliber. 
It fails to dive as deep as Pinkprint 
cuts, “All Things Go,” “The 
Crying Game” or “Buy a Heart.” 
Nonetheless, while it lacks overall 
quality and substance, Queen does 
have moments of hip-hop gold. 
“Barbie Dreams,” “LLC,” “Good 
Form” and “Miami” represent the 
actualization of Minaj’s constant 
flexing on the record.

But a lot of the time, stanhood 

isn’t solely based on one’s music, 
which 
explains 
the 
existence 

of Britney Spears or Katy Perry 
stans in the year 2018. Stanning 
comes from a sense of connection 
to an artist and their work, and 
it is sustained over time by the 
intra-fandom 
community 
and 

culture. As an artist grows, so 
does their brand, music and space 
in popular culture. Miley Cyrus 
is probably the most clear-cut 
example of artistic transition and 
the subsequent regrouping of a 
fan base to continue the practice 
of stanning, if one chooses to do 
so. Miley’s Bangerz era was fun, 
and I stanned the fuck out of it, 
but that foundation began to crack 
as she tone policed Minaj in an 
interview and continued to show 
ignorance in place of openness 
and understanding. Then she 
went country, and I jumped ship, 
as did many. Can you name a song 
off Younger other than “Malibu”? 
Yeah, me neither.

The unravelling of my “barb” 

status concretely began when 
Minaj shamed sex workers after 
releasing “Rich Sex,” (a bop) on 

which she says, “If you know your 
pussy worth a benz truck.” Such 
comments stem from common 
misunderstandings 
regarding 

agency 
and 
empowerment, 

especially 
in 
regard 
to 
sex 

work. It’s perhaps this same 
misunderstanding that led Minaj 
to collaborate with 6ix9ine, a 
soundcloud rapper and convicted 
sex offender.

Furthermore, she added the 

collab to a deluxe version of Queen 
to increase numbers, released 
a music video for the track and 
bragged about fighting MTV to 
allow him to perform alongside 
her. You know you’re in deep 
when MTV is like, “nah too risky 
for us.” He pleaded guilty to using 
a child (a 13-year-old) in a sexual 
performance 
after 
the 
girl’s 

mother pressed charges following 
his admitted uploading of child 
pornography to social media. 
Contextualized, 
the 
cartoon 

video for the track leaves an even 
more bitter taste in my mouth. He 
has mitigated responsibility by 
claiming he, himself was a “child” 
when the recording took place and 
Minaj evades the serious issues 
at stake, simply vouching for him 
personally and leaving it at that.

He was set to open for the 

U.S. dates of the NickiHndrxxx 
tour, 
which 
has 
now 
been 

cancelled. 
Minaj’s 
camp 
can 

claim “production issues” all they 
want, but simply told, it wasn’t 
selling. I know because I spend a 
bit of freetime on Ticketmaster, 
considering and fantasizing about 
shows I can and can’t afford to go 
to. And if it’s not selling when the 
album comes out, I doubt it will 
sell better next year. I wonder what 
percentage of would-be attendees 
decided to skip as to not support 
a confirmed, confessed abuser. 
Prior to their collaboration and 
announcement of openers, I was 
playing it by ear; you know, seeing 
if I have the money the day of and if 
so, amazing, if not, it’s OK. But once 
she hitched her wagon to his, the 
decision was made for me.

It’s understandable why Nicki 

Minaj is quick with her shield and 
even quicker to return fire: She has 
been in hip hop for over a decade, 
dodging shots of sexism and double 
standards for years all the while 
breaking up the boy’s club to a 
degree her predecessors didn’t. 
Nonetheless, she was able to do so 
because of those who came before 
her: Lil Kim, Remy Ma, Missy 
Elliot, Lauryn Hill, etc. all paved 
the way just as Nicki has carved a 
smoother path for Cardi B.

It’s this legacy, though, that 

Minaj seems least interested in 
as she tears down women around 
her in order to maintain a sense 
or 
appearance 
of 
legitimate 

superiority. She did so recently by 

recalling Lady Gaga’s collaboration 
with confirmed abuser R. Kelly 
in order to mute criticism over 
her 6ix9ine feature; however, 
she failed to recognize how Gaga 
axed the song’s video and released 
another version with Christina 
Aguilera instead of Kelly to pull 
attention. This isn’t to say Gaga is 
blameless, but she recognized a 
mistake and took actions to remove 
an abuser from the spotlight. 
All of this occured prior to the 
mainstreaming of the #MeToo 
and #TimesUp movements, so one 
might expect Nicki to have a more 
enlightened response instead of 
bringing the abuser on stage at 
Made In America festival and then 
stepping off the stage to give him a 
solo song.

Made in America was the final 

straw that broke this barbz’s back. 
The set lacked the energy and 
presence of TidalX 2016, and it 
included solo songs from Ferg and 
Uzi in addition to the abuser all 
in under an hour (short as hell for 
a headlining slot). Hardly Queen 
tingz, if you ask me.

Finally, her response to Cardi’s 

shoe toss was equally disappointing. 
On Queen Radio, she complains of 
her embarrassment in front of the 
“upper echelon” (read: Cardi is 
hood, if you didn’t know), but even 
worse than the classist rhetoric she 
has engaged in is her invocation of 
postpartum depression as reason 
for the scuffle. Cardi has been open 
about post-birth struggles, which 
led her to cancel her opening spot 
on Bruno Mars’s 24k Magic Tour, 
even going as far to share a meme 
video with the caption, “This is 
how postpartum got me.”

Nicki went off about how 

hard and common postpartum 
depression is, even giving out the 
phone number for a helpline, but 
the entire monologue was less so 
a PSA than it is a shielded shot, 
using Cardi’s honesty and post-
birth experience to discount her 
feelings, reducing them to one 
instance. Effectively Minaj negates 
any wrongdoing by offering PPD 
as a scapegoat to engaging in a real 
conversation about herself, all the 
while discounting the experiences, 
emotions and actions of any new 
mothers, especially those suffering 
from postpartum depression. They 
can speak for themselves, as can 
Cardi, as can sex workers; I want 
to hear Nicki talk about Nicki. But 
just as with survivors of sexual 
abuse and critics, Minaj has shut 
out much of her public, only getting 
a #2 and a cancelled tour in the 
process.

One day, I hope to stan again, 

but until I feel connection rather 
than confusion toward Minaj, I’ll 
be streaming the skipless Invasion 
of Privacy. Oh, and “Good Form,” a 
problematic favorite.

The unstanning of Nicki Minaj

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

This summer, I attended a 

summer composition program 
with a friend. When we first got 
our private lessons schedules, 
I texted my friend to ask if she 
was excited to study with the 
guest faculty in attendance that 
summer. I was not intimately 
familiar with all their work but 
some quick Wikipedia research 
had shown me that they were all 
quite accomplished.

My friend texted me to say 

that she was concerned. The 
world of student composers is 
small and the world of female 
composers significantly smaller 
— my friend had heard that one of 
the faculty members is “bad with 
female students,” making them 
feel uncomfortable. “Be careful 
around him,” my friend had been 
warned.

I wish I could say this fear 

was unfounded, that my friend 
was being overly cautious. I wish 
I could say that this behavior 
wouldn’t have been noticeable 
in 
my 
extremely 
limited 

interactions with the faculty 
member.

But this behavior was apparent 

throughout the program, as 
the 
faculty 
member 
treated 

the 
female 
composers 
and 

performers with sudden bouts 
of condescension and thinly-
veiled contempt. To me, at 
least, this faculty member was 
obviously incredibly prejudiced. 
To the other students, however, 
“something 
was 
amiss,” 

something that was probably 
linked to the faculty member’s 
eccentric, creative personality 
type. My friend, too, was not 
particularly disturbed by the 
issue, at least not to the degree 
that I was. She heard these 
rumors second-hand, and even 
then she had not heard of any 
specific instance of inappropriate 
behaviour. While I was obsessed 
with these rumors, I could not 
prove that this particular faculty 
member was part of this problem.

Ever since this experience, 

I have become obsessed with 
the prejudice that seems to be 
inherent to classical music. I 
grew up in New York, studying 
composition in New York City and 
participating in what I thought 
was a progressive and open-
minded cultural scene. I’d worked 
with many female composition 
teachers in my life, unfortunately 
a rarity even in today’s world. I 
had always considered myself to 
be aware of the diversity problem 
in classical music. I believed 
in the diversification of the 
canon. I believed in anonymous 
applications and diversity and 
inclusion 
initiatives. 
But 
in 

hindsight, I had never done 
anything 
to 
challenge 
the 

larger culture that made these 
initiatives 
necessary. 
In 
my 

blindness, I had contributed to 
the problem even as I told myself 
that I believed in the solution.

This experience brought past 

issues that I had dismissed back 
to the surface. What about the 
allegations 
of 
a 
relationship 

between 
a 
student 
and 
a 

composition teacher that I had 
heard about? What about the 
multiple allegations involving 
another 
composition 
teacher 

that I knew to be credible and 
that I knew had not resulted 
in any substantial action? And 
perhaps most frighteningly, what 
about the lack of diversity that 
surrounds me every day as I head 
to class or attend a concert? Why 
was I only now rethinking my 
responses to these incidents?

Though I may be particularly 

ignorant, I would like to think 
that my failure to recognize the 
privileges I benefit from is quite 
common. Classical music, after 
all, is one of America’s least 
diverse art forms. Approximately 
80 
percent 
of 
American 

orchestras are conducted by men. 
Only one woman (Marin Alsop) 
conducts one of America’s top 
professional 
orchestras. 
And 

only 1.8 percent of orchestral 

musicians are Black.

The more that I researched, 

the more that I learned that I 
was participating in an art form 
that had spent hundreds of years 
systemically oppressing women 
and people of color. It is an art 
form that those in power have 
referred to as “high art,” a term 
seeped in condescension and 
hierarchical dominance. It’s an 
artificial standard that has been 
used by the powerful to dismiss 
all other forms of music as 
“lesser” music, “popular” music 
(as though this was somehow a 
bad thing), “vernacular” music.

Had I been participating in the 

perpetuation of this culturally 
repressive system? By consuming 
classical music, had I been aiding 
in this continued system of 
dominance? Was my attendance 
at a concert a part of this problem? 
Should I stop attending concerts 
or listening to classical music?

I’ve been thinking about this 

for a month and yet I am still 
no closer to finding the answer 
to these questions. I can say 
that I have started obsessively 
researching 
organizations’ 

previous programming before 
attending concerts. I have been 
attending 
more 
concerts 
by 

and listening to more works by 
women and people of color.

Though many of these rumors 

will probably never affect me 
directly, I’ve learned to consider 
them anyway. If I find them to be 
credible or at least believable, I’ve 
realized that I have to share them 
with others — not only because 
it is important for the good of 
others but because I cannot live 
with myself if I truly believed 
that I hadn’t done anything to 
stop people such as the faculty 
member I met over summer.

But as I’ve done this, I’ve 

learned to be realistic in my 
understanding of my own role 
in the classical music world. Just 
as no one person is the source of 
these problems, no one person 
can be the solution. Despite my 
desires to speak of myself as part 
of the solution, I’ve learned to be 
realistic and honest. Yes, I am 
aware of these problems. And 
yes, I believe that I am doing 
something to fix them. But I 
cannot deny that I was unaware 
of the severity of these problems 
until this summer. And I cannot 
claim that I have done anything 
particularly 
noteworthy 
to 

address these problems in the 
classical 
music 
community. 

While I would like to think of 
myself as part of the solution, I’ve 
learned that I cannot do so — that 
I must avoid the complacency 
that this would afford me.

Lastly, I’ve been thinking a lot 

about the question of separating 
the art from the artist. This is 
a debate that I am sure that we 
are all familiar with. A more 
interesting question, in my view, 
is the separation between the 
artists and the artform. Should 
classical music be dismissed for 
its resistance to the increasing 
diversity we see throughout 
virtually all other facets of 
American 
art? 
Critics 
have 

spoken for years of classical 
music as a dying art form 
becoming less and less relevant to 
contemporary American culture 
— should we let it die?

Ultimately, I believe that we 

can separate the artists and the 
artform. I am reminded of Missy 
Mazzioli’s quote recently in her 
interview with The New York 
Times.

“This 
music 
belongs 
to 

everybody,” 
she 
said, 
“and 

everybody has their own way in.”

Rather 
than 
changing 
an 

artform from the outside, it’s 
important to change it from the 
inside — to actively challenge 
those individuals and practices 
that discriminate. It is time for 
those of us that have benefited 
from or been indifferent to 
classical music’s discriminatory 
practices to note and challenge 
these practices. We must do all 
we can to ensure that this music 
does belong to everybody and 
that everybody can find their way 
in.

Separating the 
artists and the 

artform

Back to normal
I

t’s a sweltering September 
Tuesday 
in Ann 
Arbor, the kind 
of day where 
the heat just 
seems to slow 
down the pace 
of life itself.
Students 
stroll down 
State Street in 
t-shirts, shorts 
and sandals 
on their way to class, trying to soak 
in as much summer as they can. 
Hockey sticks, heavy sweaters and 
ice rinks are surely the last thing on 
their minds.
But even inside Yost Ice Arena, 
where the Michigan hockey team 
runs through an afternoon practice 
18 days before the start of its season, 
you can sense that same mood. 
There’s an air of calm and ease, if 
not necessarily tranquility — this is 
hockey, after all.
An air of normalcy, if you will.
Mel Pearson projects this same 
air. The Wolverines’ second-year 
coach displayed an even demeanor 
throughout his first year at the 
helm, through blowouts, nail-biters, 
joy and heartbreak alike.
On this afternoon, it doesn’t 
appear as if anything’s changed. 
Pearson walks into the Yost media 
room, greets a group of reporters, 
takes a seat and says the same two 
words he used to start so many 
press conferences and interviews 
last year.
“Fire away.”
***
Of course, nothing about 
Michigan’s 2017-18 season was 
normal.
The Wolverines won 13 games in 
Red Berenson’s final season. They 
ended up doubling that total only 
one year later. The Big Ten’s coaches 
picked them to finish ahead of only 
Michigan State. They placed third 
in the conference. They hadn’t made 
a Frozen Four since 2011. In what 
was supposed to be a rebuilding 
year, with the third-youngest team 
in the nation, Michigan came 
within six seconds of playing for a 

national title.
But Pearson and his team 
had almost no time to savor this 
unexpected success. Dexter 
Dancs, Cooper Marody and Tony 
Calderone — the high-scoring 
“DMC” line — broke up just days 
after the semifinal loss to Notre 
Dame. Calderone and Dancs 
graduated, and Marody signed 
with the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers, 
foregoing his last year of college 
eligibility.
And so began a tumultuous 
offseason, even for Michigan 
hockey standards.
Junior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi had a career season, with 
five goals and 22 assists as part 
of the Wolverines’ top defensive 
pairing. The Dallas Stars, who 
drafted him three years ago, wanted 
in on this success and pushed hard 
to sign him.
But Cecconi had unfinished 
business. He wanted to finish 
his degree. He didn’t want to, in 
his words, “let down” his class. 
And he wanted to win a national 
championship.
In April, shortly after he decided 
to stay for his senior year, his 
teammates named him captain for 
2018-19.
“Once we found out that he was 
going to stay, it was pretty obvious,” 
Pearson said. “ … We thought if we 
had a leadership group, we can do 
that early, especially when we had 
our spring workouts in May and 
June. We thought it’d be good to 
have that in place if we could.”
Cecconi’s decision brought 
some stability. But uncertainty still 
loomed, and important pieces were 
still moving.
In May, top recruit Oliver 
Wahlstrom committed to Boston 
College over Michigan. In June, 
prized prospect Bode Wilde 
decommitted from the Wolverines. 
Later in the summer, the possibility 
of Jack Hughes — the projected 
No. 1 pick in the 2019 NHL Draft — 
leaving the United States National 
Team Development Program early 
to play at Michigan fizzled out.
And on June 22, Quinn Hughes 
was drafted seventh overall in 

the NHL Draft by the Vancouver 
Canucks. For the Wolverines, a 
nervous month ensued, all eyes 
fixated on whether the electrifying 
defenseman, who scored 29 points 
as a freshman, would return for his 
sophomore season.
A month later, Hughes gave the 
answer Michigan fans wanted to 
hear: He was staying in Ann Arbor.
“My heart’s obviously still at 
Michigan,” Hughes told MGoBlue.
com on July 28. “… When I look back 
at my season last year, I had a great 
year. But I didn’t win a national 
championship. So, that’s my goal 
next year, and anything less than 
that would be disappointing.”
A roller-coaster season had 
been followed by a roller-coaster 
offseason. But with Hughes’ choice, 
the makeup of the current roster 
was finally settled. Pearson’s second 
season could proceed.
***
Pearson is seemingly always 
even-keeled, but he states he is 
more “at ease” than he was at this 
time last season. He speaks in a 
measured, conversational tone, 
never showing any signs that he’s 
not as relaxed as he says he is.
He knows his team didn’t 
escape the offseason unscathed. 
The “DMC” line accounted for 34 
percent of the Wolverines’ scoring a 
season ago. But the attrition doesn’t 
worry him.
He anticipates a breakout year 
from sophomore Josh Norris. He’s 
excited about junior Jake Slaker 
taking another step forward, 
thrilled at the prospect of having 
junior Will Lockwood for a full 
season, ready to see how brothers 
Nick and Michael Pastujov can build 
off their strong finish last year. He 
can’t wait to see what Luke Morgan, 
a transfer from Lake Superior State 
who sat out last season, can do in a 
real game. He has high hopes for the 
10-man freshmen class joining the 
team. And he has Hughes — perhaps 
the best returning player in college 
hockey.
“I don’t think scoring’s going to 
be a big issue on this team,” Pearson 
said. “We’re going to score goals, 
we’ll just see where they come 

from.”
It’s understandable why Pearson 
is more comfortable now. Last 
year was one of transition, but this 
year, Pearson is familiar with his 
team, and his team is familiar with 
him. His plan, his system and his 
expectations are all in place.
“We know (players’) weaknesses 
and the areas we had to push 
them and prod them to get better,” 
Pearson said Tuesday. “And 
they’ve done that, they’ve made 
a commitment to get better 
this summer, almost to a man. I 
think we’re in the best shape I 
can remember a team being in 
physically.”
When Pearson took the job 
at Michigan, he heavily invoked 
history. He compared the program 
to a prized family car that he had 
inherited. He called his role that of a 
“gatekeeper,” protecting the legacy 
that past great coaches Vic Heyliger, 
Al Renfrew and Red Berenson had 
created.
He took the reins after the 
Wolverines’ worst season in 30 
years and led them back to national 
relevance in only one season. He 
and his team emphatically declared 
that Michigan hockey was back.
And the expectations that come 
with that are back, too.

Recently, Pearson had a 
conversation with Michigan 
basketball coach John Beilein. 
Among the things they discussed 
was the similar situation their 
respective programs are in. As 
Pearson noted, both teams went 
on unexpected, underdog runs last 
year, and both teams lost key talent 
afterwards — Moritz Wagner’s early 
departure mirroring Marody’s jump 
to the pros.
“We talked about it — what’s 
the message? How do you handle 
that?” Pearson said. “Going from 
maybe being underdogs or no one’s 
talking about you, to now you’re one 
of those teams that people might 
pick to finish near the top of the 
conference.”
Pearson and Beilein will talk 
again soon to share their thoughts. 
Figuring out how to handle the 
increased pressure is an ongoing 
process.
But the expectations themselves, 
and what they imply, are just what 
Pearson wants.
“Those are the expectations that 
you want at Michigan,” Pearson 
said. “That’s why you come here as 
a player — to win championships. 
… But having said that, again, it’s 
the process. You have to go through 
the things, make sure you’re taking 

care of all the little things and the 
championships will take care of 
themselves.”
Expectations are a funny thing. 
Fans, media and other observers 
have one set of expectations, but a 
team often has another.
“Last year, the expectations were 
to win a national championship,” 
Cecconi said. “And they’re going to 
be the same this year.”
For a player, it’s an 
understandable sentiment — why 
play if you don’t believe you can win 
the ultimate prize? But for anyone 
else, it’s a bold expectation, one 
that not even the most optimistic 
supporter would have believed in 
last season.
This year, however, things have 
changed.
Maybe the Wolverines won’t 
return to the Frozen Four this year. 
But there is a foundation on top of 
which Pearson can go about adding 
to the program’s legacy.
That air of calm emanating 
throughout Yost Ice Arena? It’s not 
an illusion.
For Michigan, things are back to 
normal.

‘M’ welcomes 10 freshmen for 2018-19 season

Less than a year ago, Nick 
Blankenburg was sitting 
on 
42 points through 57 games 
— 16 goals and 26 assists as a 
defenseman 
of 
the 
Okotoks 
Oilers from the Alberta Junior 
Hockey League. The 19-year old 
went on to rack up six goals and 
six assists in 15 playoff games, 
which named him to the AJHL 
South All-Rookie Team. 
As impressive as that is, the 
blue-liner 
has 
seen 
crazier 
offensive outputs before. In high 
school, Blankenburg racked up 
147 points through 83 games in 
a three-year span, one of which 
featured a state championship 
title in 2016. For Michigan, this 
bodes well — Blankenburg is 
just one of 10 freshmen, all of 
which come with a wide variety 
of accolades and talents between 
them. 
Those 10 newcomers are in 
an adjustment mode, trying 
to figure out the transition 
between where they’ve been 
and where they are now. For 
some, the process started last 
year — in the following months 
after Blankenburg committed 
to the Wolverines in the midst 
of his AJHL season, he started 
to scope out the team’s playing 

style and watched them battle 
their way to a Frozen Four berth 
that was one goal away from a 
championship run. 
“Coming in as a defenseman, 
I really looked more at the plays 
that Michigan’s (defensemen) 
were making and even other 
teams too,” Blankenburg said. 
“Kind of compare myself and 
see where I would fit in with the 
team at that next level.
“…Those guys are all fast 
players and they like moving 
the puck up the ice quick, and I 
know (sophomore defenseman 
Quinn Hughes) likes playing 
that offensive style. I kind of 
try to play that offensive style 
as well, but I have to be reliable 
on defense as well. So, it’s kind 
of nice to see these older guys 
and what they’re doing and learn 
from them too.”
This season, Blankenburg is 
one of three additions to the blue 
line, including Jake Gingell — a 
two-season defensemen for the 
Youngstown Phantoms of the 
USHL with a plus-30 regular-
season 
rating 
— 
and 
Jack 
Summers, who split the past two 
seasons between the USHL’s 
Tri-City Storm and the NAHL’s 
Springfield Jr. Blues.
Aside 
from 
the 
three 
defensemen, 
the 
Wolverines 
have gained five forwards and 

two 
goaltenders, 
including 
Strauss Mann from the USHL’s 
Fargo Force, the Clark Cup 
winners. And although most 
have 
extensive 
previous 
playing experience, the ten new 
additions have spent the last few 
weeks adjusting to the intensity 
of collegiate hockey.
“They were a little nervous 
the first week,” Pearson said on 
Tuesday afternoon. “You could 
sense that, you could see that, 
a little jumpy with the puck, 
not quite sure on some things, 
being kind — I call it being kind 
to the other players — but we 
want them to compete. We want 
them to come in here and force 
guys to play hard, force people 
to earn their position. There’s 
no entitlement here, we’ve told 
them that that we need them to 
come in and play and play a vital 
role on our team. 
“I think every week you can 
see the confidence grow in them, 
and that nervousness has sort 
of subsided now and they’re 
just being themselves. They’re 
playing. They’re hockey players, 
and they’re good hockey players, 
and they have to understand that 
and just come out and do what 
they’re good at and try to get 
better every day.”
One of the biggest factors in 
getting the freshmen acclimated 

has been the returners. Now 
a three-person class after the 
departure of forward Cooper 
Marody 
to 
the 
Edmonton 
Oilers of the NHL last season, 
the senior trio of defensemen 
Joseph Cecconi, Nicholas Boka 
and forward Brendan Warren 
are heavily outnumbered by the 
newcomers. Along with them, 
the juniors and sophomores 
have had to step up to help the 
freshmen adjust.
Whether 
it’s 
pointing 
a 
freshman in the right direction 
to find a class building or 
working on systems in practice, 
the entire team has been a part 
of the adjustment period. One of 
those team members, sophomore 
forward Josh Norris, has tried to 
embody that as best possible.
“It’s my second year here and 
I’ve taken on more of a leadership 
role here,” Norris said. “I think, 
just for the freshmen, relating 
to them personally, there’s a lot 
of ups and downs your first year 
and you can get frustrated with 
things easily and take it the 
wrong way, and maybe be led 
down the wrong path. I know 
they’re gonna struggle at points, 
that’s just the nature of it, so just 
trying to help them with that 
and if they need anything I’m 
here for them.”
Added 
Blankenburg: 
“Off 
the ice, any question that I’ve 
had — whether it’s where the 
Chemistry building is or where 
anything is, they’ve been nice 
so far. Boka let me and another 
freshman this summer borrow 
his moped so that was a huge 
help for us. All the guys have 
been great, I sit next to Boka, 
he helps me out a lot with any 
questions I have. It’s just all the 
guys, not even just the seniors, 
everyone’s been helping us on 
and off the ice that they’ve been 
so helpful.”
Despite all of the stats and 
a 
quick 
acclimation 
period, 
Michigan is once again looking 
at a lopsided roster with a lot 
of fresh faces and few senior 
leaders. But, as they showed 
last season, the Wolverines like 
to blow expectations out of the 
water — and with all of the young 
talent, they just might be able to 
do that again.

Safeties still learning 
to play smart and fast

It’s hard to look at the 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 
defense and find a weak spot.
If you had to choose one, 
though, 
it 
might 
be 
the 
Wolverines’ 
safeties. 
That 
isn’t necessarily an insult, 
but a statement on just how 
strong Michigan’s defense is. 
Still, safeties have committed 
the most easily identifiable 
mistakes through three games 
this season.
First, against Notre Dame, 
there was junior Josh Metellus’ 
targeting call that got him 
kicked out just minutes into 
the game. Some didn’t view it 
as a penalty, but the call was 
made nonetheless, and it forced 
sophomore Brad Hawkins into 
the game.
Moments 
later, 
Hawkins 
was beaten on a jump ball in 
the endzone, as the Fighting 
Irish went up 14-0 en route to 
a 24-17 win.
Then, last week against 
SMU, the Mustangs scored 
their 
first 
touchdown 
when Hawkins and junior 
cornerback David Long had 
some miscommunication and 
left a wide receiver running all 
alone down the sideline for a 
50-yard score.
“Inconsistent,” said safeties 
and special teams coach Chris 
Partridge of his unit’s play. 
“… There’s always room for 
improvement. But I thought 
when we were good, we were 
really, really good. You know, 
we had some mistakes in the 
first game. We cleaned them 
up and played really good in 
the second game and then, you 
know, played pretty good in the 
third game overall. If you took 
four or five plays out of each of 
those starters, just alignment 
and stuff, they would have 
graded really high — over a 
90. But those four or five plays 
were in there, and we’ve gotta 
clean that stuff up.”

As Partridge implied, it isn’t 
all doom and gloom.
Metellus was called for a 
pass interference penalty late 
in the second half against 
SMU. Then he made up for it in 
a big way, securing a pick-six 
as time expired in the first half 
to shift the momentum of the 
game entirely.
Senior Tyree Kinnel, one 
of 
the 
defensive 
captains, 
has 
been 
solid 
too, 
and 
Hawkins has been a pleasant 
surprise. All three have played 
aggressively, flying downhill 
to make plays in run support 
when needed.
That aggressiveness is a 
catch-22, though. It has led 
to the targeting and pass 
interference 
penalties 
that 
have plagued the group. It’s 
something Partridge says they 
are going to have to learn to play 
with, because he’s not going to 
tell them to play timidly.
“We’re gonna be aggressive, 
and we’re always gonna be 
aggressive,” 
Partridge 
said. 
“But we need to understand 
when we need to be aggressive 
… when do we lay off, when do 
we be aggressive because it’s 
on the field of play and when 
do we don’t.”
Ultimately, the safeties are 
a talented group of players. 
Their ability is clear in spurts 
throughout each game.
And they’re an experienced 
group, too. Both Kinnel and 
Metellus were starters last 
season. So maybe it’s just 
early-season jitters, but for the 
defense to reach its potential, 
it will need the safeties to 
tighten things up.
“It’s 
just, 
these 
guys 
are 
going 
100 
miles 
per 
hour,” Partridge said, “And 
sometimes it’s the 30th or 
40th play and they’re going 
hard, they’re a little tired, and 
they’re so locked in, you’ve just 
gotta teach them that in a split 
second, you’ve gotta be able to 
react and know the situation 
that’s coming.”

Junior running back Chris Evans suffered an injury against SMU but is expected to play against Nebraska, according to running backs coach Jay Harbaugh.

In wake of injuries, Jay Harbaugh expresses confidence in running backs

After 
the 
game 
against 
Western 
Michigan, 
junior 
running back Chris Evans said 
the running lanes created by 
Michigan’s offensive line were so 
big you could drive a car through 
them.
Against 
SMU, 
you 
could 
hardly fit a bicycle most of the 
day.
The 
Wolverines 
rushed 
the ball 41 times for 197 yards 
against the Mustangs. On paper, 
those numbers are solid. But 11 
of those carries and 109 of those 
yards came in two garbage-time 
drives, while the rest — which 
produced a measly 2.9 yards-per-
carry average — came within a 
two-possession game.
Starting running back Karan 
Higdon was fully dressed for 
Saturday’s contest, but ultimately 

sat out due to an undisclosed 
injury. Instead, it was the No. 2 
back Evans who handled ball-
carrying responsibilities, and 
he proved to be less than stellar 
compared to the ground show 
— 308 yards — from a game ago 
as he struggled in short-yardage 
situations.
After a 35-yard run late, Evans 
came up limping, grabbing his 
hamstring. Originally, Evans’ 
apparent 
injury 
cast 
doubt 
on both Higdon and Evans’ 
availability 
against 
Nebraska 
this weekend.
“Karan 
was 
a 
game-time 
decision, didn’t feel like he could 
go. Chris, we’ll see what his 
situation is exactly, whether it’s a 
strain or a cramp,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh on Monday. 
“We’ll see (for next week).”
But on Wednesday, running 
backs 
coach 
Jay 
Harbaugh 
cleared the air and anticipates 

both to see the field.
“That’s what we expect,” Jay 
said. “Karan has practiced fully, 
and Chris has practiced fully 
for what we expect him to do. 
(Chris had) been going, it’s just 
maybe not the 
same 
amount. 
He did a little bit 
yesterday, 
and 
we’re 
building 
up as we go as 
he comes off that 
tweak.”
Even without 
the 
two 
on 
the 
field, 
Jay 
expressed 
satisfaction 
in 
the depth of his 
unit and their play on Saturday. 
That depth includes sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason, and third 
and 
fourth-string 
running 
backs Tru Wilson and O’Maury 
Samuels. 
Mason 
vultured 
a 

goal-line touchdown for the first 
score of the game, Wilson toted 
the ball 11 times for 53 yards and 
a late-game touchdown, while 
Samuels gashed an 18-yard run 
on that same drive.
Wilson 
has 
been a hot topic to 
start the season. 
The former walk-
on also had six 
carries 
for 
54 
yards against the 
Broncos, and has 
proved to be a 
viable 
backfield 
option 
in 
pass 
protection.
“He’s 
approached 
everything 
with 
pretty 
remarkable consistency, fixing 
mistakes, improving techniques, 
playing 
with 
great 
effort 
and physicality,” Jay said. “… 
Whenever you challenge him 

with something to improve on 
and an area to grow, inevitably 
you see it show up. If you do that 
over months or years, the results 
are gonna be pretty good and 
everyone’s gonna see that now.
“He’s a tough guy, got some 
wrestling background. He’s got a 
family of boys, roughhouse quite 
a bit, so certainly fearless to his 
benefit on the field.”
That hard-nosed sentiment 
was 
expressed 
again 
with 
Mason, as Jay praised his “smash 
everything attitude.”
The Wolverines have had 
success with a power-running 
style 
this 
season, 
but 
this 
approach has also been criticized 
amid sustained concern about 
the offensive line’s ability to 
open holes through the middle. 
This uncertainty has placed 
an unusually public amount of 
emphasis on the running backs’ 
pass protection abilities. With 

Mason’s desire to “bludgeon 
people and do it really fast,” 
according to Jay, his role is 
defined. As for the others, it’s an 
innate instinct that still appears 
to be a work in progress in the 
simplified offensive playbook.
“Because we do a little less 
schematically, we’re probably 
more 
proficient 
across 
the 
board,” Jay said. “There’s some 
trust there. They build rapport 
with the o-line in terms of 
understanding how a look is 
gonna be blocked up and a little 
of what to expect — ‘Okay, I see 
this defensive line in this look. I 
expect the ball to go in this place 
or that place.’ A level of trust that 
builds in that regard, because we 
have a little more consistency in 
scheme.”
In Big Ten play, the order is 
taller. But with apparent depth 
in the running back room, the 
coaching staff can rest easy.
