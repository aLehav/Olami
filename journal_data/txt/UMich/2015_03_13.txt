CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Husband Mat 
Chavez arrested 

Wed. on assault and 

battery charges 

By ANASTASSIOS

Daily Staff Reporter

A fundraising campaign ini-

tiated by a University student 
has raised several thousand dol-
lars for an Ann Arbor homeless 
couple.

On March 1, Kinesiology 

junior 
Michael 
Funkhouser 

began an online funding cam-
paign aimed at raising $10,000 
for Mat Chavez and his wife 
Danielle Chavez. Mat Chavez 

usually plays guitar for dona-
tions on the corner of State and 
North University Street, out-
side of Walgreens. Funkhouser 
said he had seen the two on the 
street many times and had lis-
tened to Mat Chavez’s guitar 
playing, which he found to be 
very good.

“I stopped to talk to him one 

day and I realized he had a real-
ly unique and really cool story 
and I started thinking of ways to 
help him out,” Funkhouser said. 
“And the next day I came back 
with the plan of videotaping his 
story and seeing if other people 
would take notice of it.”

Since March 1 the campaign 

has attracted 245 donors who 
have contributed a total of 
$6,952 as of Thursday evening.

Mat Chavez was arrested 

Wednesday with charges of bat-
tery and assault, the Washtenaw 
County Jail confirmed on Mon-
day. He was still being held as of 
Thursday at 5 p.m.

Ann Arbor Police declined 

to provide exact details of the 
incident, and the Chavez couple 
was not available for comment. 
However, Funkhouser said he 
spoke to Danielle Chavez about 
20 minutes after the incident 
took place.

“Danielle told me that anoth-

er homeless man spit in her face 
and Mat retaliated by hitting 
the guy,” Funkhouser said. “The 
homeless man then called the 
police on Mat and a warrant was 
issued for his arrest.”

RIME works with 
clinics to increase 
awareness among 
low-income patients

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

Approaching its second year 

on campus, the student organi-
zation Redefining Innovation 
in Medical Engineering has 
devoted time to a diverse array 
of projects, from helping rural 
communities in India to working 
on health policy solutions for the 
Metro Detroit area.

RIME is focused on providing 

medical solutions to patients in 
lower-income markets, according 
to Engineering freshman Colin 
Halow, a member of the group. 
This year, the group is planning to 
refocus its efforts locally.

They are currently working 

with three clinics in the area — 
the HUDA Clinic, Cass Clinic 
and Hamtramck Clinic.

Harish Kilaru, RIME co-

founder and co-president, said 
he helped found the organiza-
tion last year to develop medical 
devices for rural areas.

Last year, RIME’s target area 

was in rural India. The group 
created a device that could diag-
nose jaundice, a yellow discolor-
ation of the skin, from outside 
the skin. According to Kilaru, 
however, the device had issues 

with actual implementation.

“We realized it’s very difficult 

to design a product for a market 
that you can only visit once or 
twice a year,” Kilaru said. “It’s 
hard to understand what they 
value, and we had a lot of assump-
tions that we couldn’t validate 
until we went to the country.”

This experience led the group 

to switch gears and focus closer 
to home. Projects in the works 
for this year include a rewards 
system to incentivize patients to 
refer others to clinics by offering 
discounts at places like the Salva-
tion Army and food pantries.

“We want to see whether the 

rewards are enough to incentiv-
ize people to tell their friends 
to go to the clinic,” Kilaru said. 
“We’re trying to increase the 
number of low-income patients 
that are utilizing primary care, 
and that issue stems from the 
fact low-income patients don’t 
often know where the clinic is.”

The group is also developing a 

website for patients and provid-
ers that will provide information 
about which services are offered 
at individual clinics.

The group’s members include 

undergraduates as well as grad-
uate students. RIME is funded 
through Innovate Blue, and also 
received funds from last year’s 
Optimize Social Innovation Chal-
lenge on campus.

Halow said he thought the 

organization’s work, especially

‘What would you 
do in 15 seconds?’ 
discusses impacts 

of rocket fire

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

If you were given 15 seconds to 

seek shelter from an approaching 
rocket, what would you do?

For Israelis living in Sderot, a 

city near the Hamas-controlled 
Gaza strip, this question is not a 
hypothetical one.

Noam Bedein, a native Israeli 

photographer, is the director 
of the Sderot Media Center, a 
nonprofit media advocacy cen-
ter dedicated to spreading the 
individual voices of Sderot to 
the international media and 
public. His presentation “What 
could YOU do in 15 seconds?” on 
Thursday evening drew roughly 

30 people to the Michigan Union.

Last October marked Sderot’s 

15th year under Qassam rocket 
fire from Hamas. Bedein said 
that since August of 2005 — when 
Israel gave up the Gaza strip ter-
ritory — more than 24,000 rock-
ets have been fired from Gaza 
into Israel.

Bedein focused on the nor-

malizing effect that the constant 
threat of rockets has had on 
Israeli societies such as Sderot.

“I came to this town to become 

a student, not knowing too much 
about this rocket reality,” Bedein 
said. “I noticed how there’s no 
public office, government office 
or press center to speak out for 
the residents. I’ve established 
the Sderot Media Center to try 
becoming a voice and face of the 
region, pursuing this ongoing 
rocket reality, which somehow 
became acceptable.”

With lighting 
moratorium now 
lifted, students 

lobby for changes

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS 

and ANDREW ALMANI

Daily Staff Reporters

Ann Arbor might soon see 

the light.

During the Feb. 17 Ann Arbor 

City Council meeting, the City 
Council adopted a resolution 
that lifted a moratorium on 
the installation of new lighting 
that had been in effect in since 
2005.

The moratorium has been in 

effect since fiscal year 2006 and 
was adopted due to the increasing 
costs of DTE Energy lighting. 
With the moratorium lifted, 
several 
student 
governments 

are considering proposals to 
evaluate 
off-campus 
lighting 

after hearing student concerns 
about off-campus safety.

There are two owners of 

off-campus streetlights in Ann 
Arbor — the city and DTE. 

The 
city 
compensates 
DTE 

for the streetlights that DTE 
owns, both for their use and 
their maintenance. The city is 
responsible for the maintenance 
of the streetlights that it owns, but 
still pays DTE for the energy use.

According to a streetlight 

whitepaper 
created 
by 
the 

Systems 
Planning 
Unit 
in 

September 2013, by the close of 
the 2013 fiscal year Ann Arbor 
had 7,437 streetlights. Of these 
DTE owned 5,234 while the city 
owned the remaining 2,203.

The city began using LED 

streetlights in 2006, according 
to the whitepaper. LED lights 
are more expensive but have 
fewer maintenance and energy 
expenses, which makes them 
preferable.

The moratorium does not 

mean that new lights have not 
been installed or that old ones 
have not been replaced in the 
city. The condition is that these 
replacements and installments 
do not cause a net increase in 
streetlight costs.

The resolution for lifting the 

moratorium 
was 
introduced

Annual mental 

health event talks 
increased stress on 
college campuses

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a survey con-

ducted by the American College 
Health Association in 2011, 30 
percent of college students have 
reported at some point in the pre-
vious year feeling “so depressed 
that it was difficult to function.”

The National Mental Health 

Institute states that depression 
may not only affect a student’s 
ability to function, but is also 
major health risk for suicide and 
other forms of self-harm.

Comprehensive 
Depression 

Center hosted the 13th annual

conference on Wednesday and 
Thursday to discuss how student

students to perform their best.

University

Monday meeting to 
also include report 
on homelessness

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULUS

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

will meet Monday to discuss a 
number of topics, including a reso-
lution to support a state ballot pro-
posal for allocation of funds by the 
Michigan Department of Trans-
portation, the annexation of the 
Nixon Farm and a report from the 
Delonis Center.

Ballot Proposal 15-1

City Council will hear a resolution 

to support of State Ballot Proposal 
15-1, a part of a proposal to improve 
Michigan’s roads passed earlier this 
year by the state legislature.

Because the proposal includes 

amending the state sales tax from 6 
percent to 7 percent, which chang-
es the state constitution, it requires 

a statewide vote that will occur 
May 5. If passed, among other 
changes it will allow funds to be 
allocated to the counties of Michi-
gan for a variety of infrastructure-
related improvements.

According to the Transportation 

Revenue Sales Tax Ballot Proposal, 
Washtenaw County will receive an 
estimated $21,402,244 for the 2016 
fiscal year, $25,339,238 for the 2017 
fiscal year and $29,276,232 for the 
2018 fiscal year and beyond.

Of these funds, Ann Arbor 

would receive $9,193,546 for the 
fiscal year of 2016, $10,851,563 for 
the 2017 fiscal year and $12,509,579 
for the 2018 fiscal year and beyond.

Along 
with 
the 
sales 
tax 

increase, the ballot proposal would 
increase the fuel tax and modify 
tax credits and school funding, 
among other changes.

The earned income tax credit 

will rise from 6 percent to 20 per-
cent of the federal credit amount 
and eligibility for these credits will 
increase. Additionally there would 
be a $300 million annual increase 

for the School Aid Fund, $100 mil-
lion more for revenue sharing and 
more funding for community col-
leges. Universities will no longer 
receive funding from School Aid 
monies.

In Ann Arbor, the funds for the 

proposal are slated for used on a 
variety of projects in the city like 
fixing roads. The state gas taxes will 
also be used for transportation.

The legislation text notes that 

24 percent of the City of Ann 
Arbor’s streets are classified as in 
poor condition.

Nixon Farm Annexation

Council will hear two resolu-

tions: one resolution calls for the 
annexation of the Nixon Farm 
North, a 69-acre area and the 
other for the Nixon Farm South, a 
41-acre area.

Should City Council adopt the 

resolutions, the city of Ann Arbor 
would take on the designated areas 
of the Nixon Farms from the Ann 
Arbor Township. Each resolution 
requires eight votes to pass.

The resolutions note that the 

City Planning Commission pro-
posed the annexation at a meeting 
held Oct. 21, 2014.

Delonis Center

City Council will also hear an 

interim report on the winter expan-
sion of the Shelter Association of 
Washtenaw County at the Delo-
nis Center. The Warming Center 
expanded its operations to full-time 
hours from November to March.

According to the report that 

will be presented to Council, the 
shelter required that all occupants 
register through the Housing 
Access of Washtenaw County and 
go through a screening test.

The report notes that through 

Feb. 27, 2015, 488 unique individuals 
were screened at the Delonis Center 
and referred to the Warming Center.

Subsequently, 367 people used 

the Warming Center 1, Warming 
Center 2 or the Rotating Shelter.

Council will also hear about 

the challenges the Delonis Center 
faced that included reluctance of 
some people to go to the Warm-
ing Center and the refusal by 
some to go through the screening 
process.

City Council to discuss state 
ballot proposal on road funding
in Sderot featured a bomb 

shelter that was painted to 
appear like a caterpillar.

“For me the sum of this entire 

presentation in one photograph 
… this is it… when you picture 
a playground and a bomb shel-
ter in one photograph. What 
other country in the world has a 
bomb shelter right next to a play-
ground?” Bedein asked.

In a video clip he showed the 

audience, kindergarten students 
were seen playing outside when 
sirens went off. The students 
immediately ran inside to the 
nearest bomb shelter and began 
counting down. At the end of 
the countdown they sang a song. 
Bedein explained that the chil-
dren are taught to sing the song 
to distract them from the sound 
of explosions hitting Sderot.

Bedein, who dedicates much 

of his time to interviewing and 
photographing those affected by 
the threat of rocket attacks, told 
the audience that virtually every-
one living in the western Negev 
region of Israel has his or her 
own unique story about an expe-

rience with a rocket explosion.

Bedein also discussed the 

effect of media bias on the issue 
of coverage in Israel. He said 
many people know about the 
humanitarian issues in Gaza but 
not of those in Sderot or neigh-
boring Israeli communities.

Due to Israel’s missile defense 

system, Bedein said recent con-
flict has produced unbalanced 
fatalities — 72 Israeli deaths com-
pared to the over 2,000 deaths of 
civilians in the Gaza strip.

Since last summer, members 

of the University student group 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality held candlelight vigils 
in response to the violence. The 
University’s chapter of J Street, 
a national organization advocat-
ing for a two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, also 
held a vigil in September.

Siren systems implemented 

in Israeli cities warn residents 
of approaching rockets roughly 
15 seconds before they hit the 
ground. Israel has also provid-
ed extensive funding to at-risk 
communities for bomb shelters, 
minimizing rocket fatalities as 
a result.

At the end of his presentation, 

Bedein shared with the audience 

several drawings from elementa-
ry school students in Israel who 
are under the threat of rockets. 
Many of them were addressed to 
children living in Gaza, asking 
for peace and showing support 
for children their own age who 
are under the threat of violence 
as a result of the conflict as well.

LSA freshman Rachel Byrd 

said she had knew about the situ-
ation in Sderot, but found the pre-
sentation was still eye opening.

“Those videos were pretty 

powerful, to see how normalized 
rocket fire has become in Israel 
and how little I knew,” Byrd said. 
“(The presentation) definitely 
made me want to look into differ-
ent resources or different news 
outlets because I’ve definitely 
been getting different informa-
tion than what I heard today.”

LSA sophomore Ben Siegel 

was especially affected by the 
drawings Israeli children had 
made for Palestinian children.

“What stood out to me the 

most would probably be that 
even through all these kids are 
going through, they still have 
this good sentiment towards Pal-
estinians and they want peace 
even though they’re constantly 
under pressure,” he said.

lot of smaller health issues are

“There are a lot of local 

problems that we seem to 
overlook, because everything 
is pushing toward global and 
holistic care, so we want to 
make sure that we actually 
pay attention to these small 
problems,” Halow said.

Kilaru said the disparity 

between health care in rural 
countries often seems more 
pressing than domestic issues, 
even though it’s more difficult 
to solve.

“Groups on campus are 

much more likely to have a 
much larger impact on a cul-
ture that they understand 
well, and serving low-income 
patients in Detroit is much 
more similar to what we 
understand,” Kilaru said. “And 
although it’s important to look 
globally, a lot of these prob-
lems still exist at home.”

In a video that Funkhouser 

produced for the campaign, the 
couple explains that they became 
homeless after Danielle Chavez 
lost her job as a receptionist due 
to a persistent illness and Mat 
could not sustain them with his 
job as a carpet installer.

In an interview Wednesday, 

the couple said since coming to 
Ann Arbor they’ve spent nights 
in their car when they had one, as 
well as at friends’ houses, hotels 
and on the streets. Every day, they 
try to collect enough money to be 
able to stay at a hotel for the eve-
ning, which they said they man-
age to do a little more than half of 
the time.

On nights they don’t find a 

place to stay, Mat Chavez said 
they walk around the city and try 
to find a place open late, as well as 
remain in areas that are protected 
from the weather.

In response to the donation cam-

paign, the Chavez couple said they 
are very grateful to Funkhouser as 
well as for the donations, and did 
not expect such a response.

“I’m still amazed because it’s 

good to see that there are really 
good people out there and that 
just really proves it,” Danielle 
Chavez said. “Anytime anyone’s 
discouraged and thinks ‘there’s 
only bad people out there’ — no, 
that is not true.”

Mat Chavez echoed his wife’s 

gratitude. He noted, however, that 
though money has been collected 
through the campaign, he and his 
wife will not actually have the 
money for a few weeks after dona-
tions close. They still need money 
every day to sustain themselves.

“Last Thursday we didn’t make 

it, and it was really cold outside, 
and I am walking around and I’m 
going ‘Oh my God! I have $4,000, 
but I don’t have $4,000,’ ” he said.

Both told the Daily that they 

moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor 
about two years ago after becom-
ing homeless because they said it 
is safer here for homeless people.

“Plus, we had heard that there 

were services for homeless peo-
ple here,” Mat Chavez said. “We 
found out, as we got here, that 
is not so much the case. But it is 
much easier to be homeless here.”

The couple noted that most 

people in Ann Arbor treat them 
well and only a few have mistreat-
ed them. Danielle Chavez said 
she’s been screamed and spit at by 
people walking by her.

Mat Chavez said he feels like 

the city almost doesn’t want 
homeless people to improve their 
situation, referencing the city’s 
actions this summer to bulldoze 
a homeless campsite in Broadway 
Park. The residents were told they 
were on the property illegally and 
had 48 hours to vacate.

“Not only will they not build a 

bigger shelter, they won’t build 
another shelter, they won’t do any-
thing but they want to come tear 
people’s tents down and their sug-
gestion is ‘well leave, why won’t 
these people just leave,’ ” he said.

He added that the decrease of 

funding to mental hospitals is a 
further problem for homelessness 
in Ann Arbor.

Danielle Chavez noted that 

while Ann Arbor has better ser-
vices for homeless people than 
other places, shelters and afford-
able housing are services that the 
city needs to improve.

“You can get 24 free meals in a 

week here, but there is nowhere to 
sleep,” she said.

Funkhouser said he believed 

the $10,000 funding target was 
enough to put the couple back on 
their feet.

“With renting apartment and 

food every day and the every-
day expenses, I figured that they 
would have a cushion instead 
of having to try and get back on 
their feet with, let’s say, $1,000,” 
he said.

Funkhouser said he is optimis-

tic about reaching the target and 
plans to stay in touch with the 
couple once the campaign is over 
to see if they need anything else.

Mat and Danielle Chavez said 

they are uncertain about what 
they would do with the money 
from the donations, but their pri-
ority is to get off the street and 
find a place to live, though they 
don’t know where that would be. 
Mat Chavez also added that he 
plans on forming a band once the 
couple finds a place to live.

“I have a lot of original music 

that I don’t play out here,” he said. 
“And after this experience I’m sure 
I’ll be able to write a lot more.”

half of the students who suffer 
receive help.

Schlissel 
emphasized 
the 

importance of a support network 
among students to prevent men-
tal health issues.

“We are broadening the way 

to address these illnesses and 
learning that peer support is 
vitally important among stu-
dents,” Schlissel said.

In September, Central Stu-

dent Government and Coun-
seling launched the Wolverine 
Support Network, a program 
designed to provide peer sup-
port for students on campus.

Dr. John Greden, the execu-

tive director and founder of 
UMDC, said the amount of years 
the event has existed reflects the 
importance of addressing men-
tal heath issues among college 
students.

“People who attend keep 

saying we need to continue,” 
Greden said.

Michael Young, former vice 

chancellor at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara, was 
the keynote speaker. During his 
speech, he said mental health 
issues are much more prevalent 
in modern university environ-
ments in the United States than 
they were in previous years.

“Why are so many more stu-

dents having psychological and 
psychiatric issues than in the 
past?” Young asked the crowd.

Outlining the work of a com-

mittee on mental health he co-
chaired during his time in the 
UC system, Young said the high-
er rates might come from a com-

bination of factors: the lack of a 
wide availability of counseling 
and medication, the age of men-
tal illness onset corresponding 
with the average age of the stu-
dent body and students strug-
gling to deal with failure.

He also mentioned several 

other stressors that might con-
tribute to higher incidence of 
mental health issues in recent 
years, such as helicopter par-
ents, increasing global turmoil 
after the 9/11 terrorist attacks 
and a poor job market.

Rick Warren, associate pro-

fessor of psychiatry, led a work-
shop during the conference 
focusing on how self-criticism 
could affect students’ mental 
health. He said high self-criti-
cism and low self-compassion 
both pose a high risk for devel-
oping depression.

Warren said students can also 

put themselves at risk of depres-
sion when they connect their 
self-worth to achieving their 
goals and said students need to 
accept themselves unconditionally 
regardless of their performance.

“Students need to set goals 

that 
are 
self-concordant,” 

Warren said.

Self-concordant refers to the 

concept that individuals should 
pursue goals because they want 
to, not because they feel other 
people will approve.

The conference also recog-

nized two students for the Stu-
dent Mental Health Advocate 
Award, LSA senior Siang-Chean 
Kua and Ashli Haggard, a senior 
at the University of Maryland, 
College Park.

The two students were rec-

ognized for their leadership in 
campus mental health by rais-

ing awareness of mental health 
issues, advocating for mental 
health services and reducing 
stigma around mental illnesses.

Kua wrote in an e-mail inter-

view with the Daily that he was 
motivated to get involved in 
mental health issues on campus 
through volunteering at the Uni-
versity Hospital’s inpatient psy-
chiatry unit.

“I realized that a number of 

patients admitted into the unit 
were students like myself,” Kua 
wrote. “That helped me under-
stand the scale of mental health 
issues to a greater degree and 
inspired me to do something on 
the student level.”

According 
to 
Kua, 
there 

weren’t 
any 
University 
stu-

dent groups dedicated to men-
tal health at the time. He said 
this motivated him and several 
friends to establish a Michigan 
chapter of Active Minds, an orga-
nization focused on promoting 
student discussions about mental 
health to educate and encourage 
students to seek help.

Kua, who is currently a mem-

ber of Active Minds as well as 
the Healthy Minds Coalition, 
wrote that Active Minds aims 
to promote student dialogues as 
well as “reframe and repriori-
tize mental health on campus” 
using diverse methods including 
mobile applications, video series 
and monologues.

“For the current semester, 

a mental health monologues 
event is currently being planned 
where we plan to have speakers 
discuss their own thoughts and 
experiences regarding mental 
health,” Kua wrote.

Safety

The streetlight whitepaper 

notes that a Streetlight De-
energizing Pilot in 2010 found 
that the public believed more 
lighting increases nighttime 
personal safety and a lot of 
residents believed home thefts 
would be more likely in under-
lit areas.

However the report also 

found that there is no correla-
tion between crime and light-
ing on streets, whether that 
is crime committed against 
pedestrians or occurs in the 
neighborhood.

The 
student 
community 

has also expressed concerns 
about streetlights. LSA junior 
Michael Fakhoury, chair of the 
Central Student Government’s 
Commission on Student Safety 
and Security, said many stu-
dents have complained to CSG 
about lighting on campus.

“There’s a lot of safety issues 

— there’s actually being safe, 
and the feeling of safety, which 
are two different things,” Fak-
houry said. “A lot of the areas 
that are not well lit on campus 
are being explored right now. 
Obviously we’re taking it one 
step at a time and looking at dif-
ferent issues.”

At the CSG meeting on 

Wednesday, 
a 
resolution 

regarding the moratorium and 
lighting was presented.

Assembly Resolution 4-033 

expressed support for the city’s 
removal of the moratorium, and 
called for the addition of new 
street lighting in areas where 
students have expressed griev-
ances. CSG has begun collect-
ing and analyzing data based 
off of student complaints, to 
establish a more comprehensive 
lighting recommendation to the 
city.

“Before the moratorium was 

lifted, there wasn’t much we 
could accomplish at our meet-
ings with the city,” Fakhoury 
said. “The city officials were 
very encouraging, telling us to 
look into this and gather data so 
they could examine it more and 
investigate these areas.”

A map of lighting in the 

vicinity of Hill Street, Oxford 
Road and Geddes Road was 
included in the agenda. Other 
areas being investigated by CSG 
include South Campus and Ker-
rytown.

“So we’re looking at areas 

where lighting is inadequate, 
and we’re welcome to receive 
any additional areas that stu-
dents would want to see more 
lighting at,” Fakhoury added. 
“We’re gathering the data right 
now, and the points on this map 
represent areas that have more 
than 250 feet of space between 
lights, which is ridiculous … I 
welcome anyone to e-mail me 
with crossroads at areas of con-
cern and we will definitely look 
into them.”

LSA senior Serena Bidwell, a 

member of CSG, was one of the 
students who brought forward 
issues about lighting.

“A lot of my friends have 

complained because we all 
live in off-campus housing, so 
the walks at night going home 
from the library or the week-
ends can feel very unsafe, and 
we shouldn’t feel unsafe on our 
campus,” she said.

LSA Student Government’s 

Student Life Committee has 
also received complaints. Com-
mittee Vice Chair Arun Datta, 
an LSA sophomore, said in the 
past year, two students have 
submitted complaints, one for 
catcalling at night and the other 
for feeling unsafe while walk-
ing off campus.

“They didn’t give a specific 

location, but it is pretty easy 
to understand that the whole 
off-campus area isn’t really 

lighted well,” Datta said. “LSA 
Student Government also held 
a walk along with administra-
tors around campus recently, 
in which members of the gov-
ernment helped point out spots 
that need lighting.”

Greg Bazick, the deputy 

chief of the Ann Arbor Police 
Department, also said that 
perception of safety seems to 
be greater in places that have 
more lighting.

“While 
it’s 
generally 

believed in crime prevention 
circles that lighting is a very 
effective deterrent to crime, 
studies conducted over time by 
various organizations have not 
been able to establish an abso-
lute correlation between light-
ing and crime from a statistical 
perspective. Results have been 
mixed.”

Bazick added that he does 

not expect the AAPD to be 
impacted immediately by the 
lifting of the moratorium.

“The department certainly 

wouldn’t discourage enhanced 
lighting in public rights of way, yet 
at the same time there is no data 
to indicate that those enhance-
ments would affect substantive 
change in those areas from a sta-
tistical crime measurement per-
spective,” he said.

Eaton also noted that citizens 

have raised safety concerns due 
to lack of lighting on some streets. 
He gave Packard Street, from its 
intersection with State Street 
until Stadium Boulevard, as an 
example of an under-lit area peo-
ple have complained about.

“We can’t instantly solve 

everybody’s desire to have well-
lit streets,” he said. “But we can 
start the plan by identifying 
which areas are high priority. 
And I believe that those will 
really be matters of safety.”

Funding

The lifting of moratorium 

has no immediate effect on 
the city aside from giving City 
Council the option to increase 
its budget for street lighting. 
If and when this increase will 
actually happen depends on the 
budget City Council is currently 
discussing for the fiscal years of 
2016 and 2017.

During the same City Coun-

cil meeting last month, City 
Administrator Steve Powers 
suggested that City Council tar-
get which areas need relighting 
so that staff could incorporate 
lighting for those areas in the 
budget.

The next budget meeting will 

take place March 23.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-

pher Taylor (D) said he expects 
staff to come back with a pro-
posed policy for when the city 
should introduce or decommis-
sion streetlights depending on 
the immediate need.

“Streetlight 
maintenance 

and the energy associated with 
it is a surprisingly large portion 
of our budget — somewhere 
in excess of $2 million a year,” 
Taylor said. “So cost contain-
ment is something that we will 
need to consider as we deter-
mine whether and where to 
place new streetlights.”

Eaton said the lifting of the 

moratorium is an important 
first step, but nothing is going 
to happen quickly — and that 
assessing how to fund potential 
new lighting is an issue.

“Lifting the moratorium is 

the first step in a multi-step 
process. Next we identify pri-
orities and then we identify rev-
enue that we can spend on that. 
It will take years to actually roll 
out what we fully intend to do,” 
he said.

Councilmember Julie Grand 

(D–Ward 3) noted that the 
lifting of the moratorium is 
not attached with any funding 
and simply gives the city more 
flexibility when considering 
street lighting.

“Really for me the only way 

we are going to have more fund-
ing for this is if we strengthen 
our tax base which means

-Elie Wiesel
This morning, I read of yet another act of 

anti-Semitism at one of this country’s absolute 
jewels of public education, the University of 
California, Los Angeles. During a hearing on 
Feb. 10 for a seat on the student Judicial Board, 
candidate Rachel Beyda was asked: “Given that 
you’re a Jewish student and very active in the 
Jewish community, how do you see yourself 
being able to maintain an unbiased view?”

As a Jew, the obvious bigotry of this question 

offends me deeply. However, my decision to 
speak out goes far beyond this not-so-subtle 
attack that manifests in a variety of — and 
ever increasing — ways against Jews across 
campuses throughout the nation. A recent study 
by Trinity College and the Louis D. Brandeis 
Center for Human Rights under Law found that 
54 percent of Jewish college students have been 
subject to or witnessed anti-Semitism during 
a six-month period. No, today, I am far more 
offended as an American and as one who values 
what this great country represents.

I am offended for several reasons. For 

starters, 
these 
questions 
are 
a 
brazen 

violation of the spirit, if not the very text of 
the U.S. Constitution (see: First Amendment’s 
guarantee of freedom of religion), a document 
that embodies the very principles of our 
progressive democracy. To even entertain this 
question as one appropriate for a public body, 
student or otherwise, demonstrates a deep 
ignorance of the civic foundation on which this 
country was founded and, more importantly, 

a body of laws that have evolved since their 
creation to expand the rights of and protections 
for other Americans as well.

While the question at hand targeted the 

candidate’s Jewish heritage and community 
involvement, I am not the only one who 
should fear the audacity that the statement 
embodies. If asking whether being a Jew 
would cloud one’s judgment, what about 
asking if they were a Christian, Muslim, 
Buddhist, atheist? Heck, why not ask if 
other characteristics would influence their 
perspective, like being Black, Latino, Asian, 
Native American, even white? How about 
whether they are poor, rich, Democrat, 
Republican, independent? Substitute any of 
these classifications for Jew and you can get a 
sense of what real bigotry looks like. There is 
no justification for the question and no moral 
defense for distinguishing a Jew from any 
of the other classifications enumerated, no 
matter the context.

The pinnacle of the questioner’s ignorance 

lies mostly with the arrogance of the 
presumption on which the question is based. 
To even suggest that one’s life’s experiences 
do not influence their perspective or that the 
resulting diversity of opinion is deleterious 
demonstrates a dangerous position that, 
unfortunately, is far too common on campuses 
today. To imply that the differences that 
shape us as humans contain an unacceptable 
bias equates to saying that opinions that vary 
at all from the speakers are to be summarily 
and justifiably dismissed. As an American, 
I cannot and will not accept this shameless 
attack on the values that we hold so dear.

Today, I choose not to be silent.

O

n the Wednesday before Spring Break, 
I had just come home from a diffi-
cult midterm, my brain more or less 

shriveled up and crusted 
along the edges. I was 
staring blankly in avoid-
ance of an essay due the 
next day. I was also getting 
over a cold that was going 
around campus, hacking 
up a storm as usual. And I 
realized then that in the 
three years that I’ve been 
attending the University, 
I’ve only taken one real 
semester off: the summer 
term of 2013. Every other 
term wherein classes were being taught, I 
had been studying something. I realized, 
too, looking forward into my “week off,” that 
I would have very little actual free time, as 
projects, exams, problem sets, papers, short 
stories and other assignments were going to 
be due promptly after the break.

I hope I don’t sound like I’m needlessly 

complaining here. I’ve been apprehensive 
to write a column about “burning out,” as it 
seems petty — I just need to suck it up and 
plow through, right? Everybody else is doing 
exactly that. I also know asking anything of 
my professors is inherently self-centered — 
they, too, face institutional pressures and 
deadlines, many of which I’m sure are beyond 
my knowledge. I know that my EECS profes-
sors must go through the difficult task of 
shoving hundreds of students through a stan-
dard and strict curriculum; when projects 
are due or exams are coming up, the GSIs and 
instructors are right there with us, extending 
office hours late into the night.

Still, I’ve heard plenty of anecdotal 

accounts about being sick to the point of hos-
pitalization and facing professors who won’t 
be more accommodating. I’ve seen a class-
mate pass out due to lack of sleep. I know 

of people who have taken exams with high 
fevers. I’m aware that, for people who strug-
gle with depression or mood disorders, one of 
the most frustrating experiences is not being 
able to get work done because you are com-
pletely subjected to something — this feel-
ing — that you should be able to suppress but 
always seems out of reach.

To be a successful college student at any 

school, one has to have a mental and physi-
cal constancy that, as I’ve come to realize, 
is impossible to attain. I’ve sat in lectures 
unable to focus on the course material, all the 
while knowing that if I’m not keeping up now, 
I will be even more behind than I already am. 
For the last few weeks, even though I give 
myself ample hours to sleep, I am still tossing 
and turning and waking up before my alarm 
calls me. I end up more tired and groggy than 
ever. Every bit of time I spend kicking back 
is laden with guilt. I feel that if I’m not doing 
something “productive” with my time, I am 
going to face some irreversible consequence 
in the near future. I’m always anxious about 
something, even if I can’t see what it is.

And so, in regards to the Spring Break we 

just had, I want to say this: this break was 
added to the calendar because we needed it. 
In the future, please, if we are expected to 
keep plowing through when school is in ses-
sion, then at least let us have this short week 
to ourselves, with a more reasonable work-
load: less, not more, than what we are expect-
ed to finish during the rest of the semester. 
Give us this time to recover as much as we can 
from no sleep, physical illnesses and mental 
exhaustion. Allow us to spend this time with 
our family and friends, whom we have proba-
bly been neglecting during the semester. This 
was why Spring Break was originally added 
to our semester calendar. I hope this is not 
too much to ask.

Announcing the Student Aid Bill of Rights

In an economy increasingly built 

on innovation, the most important 
skill you can sell is your knowledge. 
That’s why higher education is, 
more than ever, the surest ticket to 
the middle class.

But just when it’s never been 

more important, it’s also never 
been more expensive. The average 
undergrad who borrows to pay for 
college ends up graduating with 
about $28,000 in student loan debt.

That’s why my Administration has 

worked hard to make college more 
affordable. We expanded tax credits 
and Pell Grants, enacted the largest 
reforms to the student loan program 
in history and fought to keep interest 
rates on student loans low. We’ve 
acted to let millions of graduates cap 
loan payments at 10 percent of their 
incomes, so they don’t have to choose 
between paying the rent and paying 
back their debt. I’ve sent Congress my 
plan to bring the cost of community 
college down to zero, because two 
years of higher education should be 
as free and universal as high school 
is today.

And this week, I unveiled another 

way that we can help more Americans 
afford college. It doesn’t involve any 
new spending or bureaucracy. It’s 
a simple declaration of values — a 
Student Aid Bill of Rights.

It says: Every student deserves 

access to a quality, affordable 
education. Every student should be 
able to access the resources to pay 
for college. Every borrower has the 
right to an affordable repayment 
plan. And every borrower has the 
right to quality customer service, 
reliable 
information 
and 
fair 

treatment, even if they struggle to 
repay their loans.

That’s it. Just a few simple 

principles. But there’s a lot that 
colleges, lenders and the people you 
send to Washington can and should 
do to live up to them.

Consider the other actions I took 

this week. We’re creating a way for 
borrowers to ask questions about 
their loans or file a complaint and 
get a fast response. We’re going 
to require businesses that service 
loans to provide clear information 
about how much students owe and 
their options for repaying it, and 
help them get back in good standing 
if they’re falling behind, with 
reasonable fees on a reasonable 
timeline. We’re also going to take a 
hard look at whether we need new 
laws to strengthen protections for 
all borrowers, wherever their loans 
come from.

If you believe in a Student Aid Bill of 

Rights that will help more Americans 

pay for a quality education, I’m 
asking you to visit WhiteHouse.
gov/CollegeOpportunity. 
Sign 

your name to this declaration. Tell 
your families, friends and fellow 
students. I’m going to ask Members 
of Congress, and lenders and as 
many business leaders as I can find. 
Because making sure that students 
aren’t saddled with debt before 
they even get started in life is in all 
our interests.

This issue is personal to me. 

My grandfather had a chance to 
go to college because this country 
decided that veterans returning 
from World War II should be able 
to afford it. My mother was able 
to raise two kids by herself in part 
because she got grants that helped 
pay for her education. And Michelle 
and I are where we are today 
because of scholarships and student 
loans. We didn’t come from families 
of means, but we knew that if we 
worked hard, we’d have a shot at a 
great education. That’s what this 
country gave us.

In America, a higher education 

cannot be a privilege reserved only 
for the few. It has to be available to 
everyone who’s willing to work for it.

Barack Obama is the 

President of the United States. 

M

y last column generated 
a lot of backlash online, 
and many of the com-

ments were valid. I admit that the 
way I presented my argument was 
wrong and uninformed. It was 
entirely, unequiv-
ocally and unde-
niably the wrong 
way to go about 
explaining 
my 

ideas. I should not 
have used irrel-
evant and per-
sonal 
anecdotes 

about 
spending 

habits to try and 
stereotype socio-
economic classes. 
I should not have 
used my limited years of experi-
ence to describe an economic prob-
lem that has hundreds of facets and 
 

millions of stories.

When I wrote my last column, 

it was obvious that I didn’t 
understand the social and economic 
juxtapositions of the middle class. 
Although I don’t fall into what most 
(if not all) people consider “middle 
class,” I truly felt middle class. I live 
in a 1,700-square-foot, one-story 
home my parents bought 30 years 
ago, before the dot-com boom made 
Palo Alto prime real estate. My dad 
drove a beat-up Mazda Protégé. 
My brother’s and my Halloween 
costumes were hand-sewn by our 
mom. Both of my parents worked 
every day and alternated waking up 
very early to go to work in order to 
get home earlier so that we wouldn’t 
need expensive after-school care. 
We led an economically conscious 
lifestyle (with a few splurges) so 
that my brother and I could have 
the opportunity to attend this 
 

great school.

The way I lived fit all the social 

definitions of middle class I had 
ever heard. My mistake was that 
I believed those definitions and 
lifestyles 
fully 
and 
accurately 

described middle class. Walking 
around Palo Alto, many parts look 
similar to Ann Arbor: the sizes of the 
houses, the shops, the types of cars 
— plus or minus a few Priuses. I had 
lumped myself in as middle class 
and based my arguments on what I 
was familiar with. I thought I was 
middle class, regardless of income, 
because of my lifestyle. What I 
didn’t realize was that where I live 
gives me economic options other 
middle class families do not have. 
I was reminded repeatedly online 
that “middle class” is defined by 
social and economic factors.

However, 
after 
doing 
the 

research I should have done in 
the first place, I found I was not 
the only one with misconceptions 
about what being middle class 
meant socially and economically.

In fact, a recent CNN survey 

showed that 78 percent of people 
said they feel middle class. Only 
38 percent actually were middle 
class in their respective areas. 
That survey is online for anyone 
to take and see where they stand 
on the economic ladder. The fact 
that CNN even has this tool should 
indicate that misconceptions on 
being middle class are common. 
This survey defined middle class as 
household incomes in the middle 

fifth of each county.

According to the Washington 

Post, a survey by the Pew Research 
Center “defines the middle class 
in the United States as any adult 
in a household whose income 
sits between 66 percent and 200 
percent of the national median.” In 
this survey, most respondents also 
mislabeled themselves as middle 
class when they weren’t. I tried 
to find a universally agreed upon 
definition and could not.

So why do so many people 

identify with the middle class? An 
article by The Atlantic focused on 
what language we use to describe 
middle class. It showed that, in the 
past, middle class meant you could 
eventually pay off your mortgage, 
settle the car loan, have a job with 
health care coverage and afford the 
occasional vacation. It didn’t matter 
where you lived, and if you worked 
hard and played your cards right, 
you were going to get a slice of that 
middle-class American Dream.

Unfortunately, these days the 

old American Dream is harder 
and harder to relate to for the vast 
majority of Americans. In fact, 
according to Credit Suisse Global 
Wealth Databook, the United States 
has the most uneven distribution 
of wealth of any advanced nation. 
This 
stark 
inequality 
in 
the 

distribution of wealth has created 
pockets of America where the costs 
of living are drastically different, 
because people are paying for 
the privilege of their location. In 
certain locations, access to better 
education, leisure activities and job 
opportunities make that location 
more desirable and therefore more 
expensive. Thus, the cornerstones 
of what used to be a middle-class 
lifestyle have much more diverse 
price points. In certain places, 
a 
higher-than-national 
average 

household income can still struggle 
to meet these antiquated definitions 
of middle class.

The easiest place to see the 

national discrepancy in cost of living 
is in real estate.

Because of its expensive real 

estate and resources, the price of 
housing in the Bay Area can be 164 
percent higher than that in Ann 
Arbor. A two-bedroom, 1.5-bath, 
1,292-square-foot house is listed for 
$2.2 million in Palo Alto. In Ann 
Arbor, a similar two-bedroom, two-
bath, 1,495-square-foot house is 
listed for $269,900. That is a 715.12 
percent increase for virtually an 
identical house, just in a different 
part of the country. But it is not just 
housing. The entire cost of living 
is more expensive in Palo Alto: 
groceries, health care, utilities and 
transportation. All in all, according to 
the Tax Foundation, $105.93 dollars 
in Michigan is only worth $88.57 
in California — an approximately 
20 percent decrease in purchasing 
power. Part of that increase in price 
is paying for the privilege of living in 
a desired location.

Previously, I thought that sharing 

a middle-class lifestyle was enough 
to make me middle class. However, 
I had forgotten about the intrinsic 
value of living in one of those pockets 
of wealth. Thirty years ago, my 
parents bought a modest house to 
start a family; a house they are still 

paying off; a house that, through 
the creation of Silicon Valley, has 
come to be worth nearly $2 million. 
I didn’t think about the ability to 
liquidate that asset when I cast 
myself as middle class. If my family’s 
economic situation ever drastically 
changed, we have the safety net of 
our location. We can sell our house, 
move somewhere cheaper with fewer 
resources and less prestige, and still 
be able to live comfortably. That is an 
option most middle-class families do 
not have.

All of this points to the obvious 

conclusion that dissimilar incomes 
are necessary to support similar 
standards of living in different 
places. From the CNN survey, middle 
class in Ann Arbor is defined as a 
household income of $45,436 to 
$75,020 a year. In my hometown, 
Palo Alto, California, it’s $70,529 to 
$112,385. By this definition, I am not 
middle class. While both Palo Alto 
and Ann Arbor are socially similar 
towns, they are a good example of 
how the economic demographics of 
similar cities vary widely. Upper class 
living in expensive places resembles 
middle-class lifestyles elsewhere.

It takes more than income to 

define the middle class. The middle 
class is fuzzy; it’s inconsistent. 
 

It’s relative.

There is another definition of 

middle class that has little to do with 
economics. It is entirely political. 
According to the president, I am 
middle class. In the 2012 election, 
both candidates Mitt Romney and 
President Barack Obama denoted a 
$250,000 income as the cutoff for 
being middle class. Most economists 
believe this number is way too high. 
But it serves politicians to have a 
high cutoff for middle class. It makes 
them more popular, because they can 
appeal to a wider range of voters.

The middle class has become a 

campaign platform for politicians 
to quote in order to get our votes. 
Every major policy Obama spoke 
about in his 59-minute State of 
the Union speech this January 
focused on helping the “middle 
class.” Declaring oneself as middle 
class has become a tired platitude 
uttered to get the most from our 
elected officials.

I still struggle to define myself 

because the definition of middle 
class 
is 
so 
ambiguous. 
There 

are so many ideas, viewpoints, 
stereotypes 
and 
generalizations 

about the middle class that it is no 
surprise many people are puzzled 
about 
how 
they 
should 
label 

themselves. But as humans, we are 
hardwired to label everything.

Unfortunately, 
I 
went 
viral. 

Although I have no desire to ever go 
viral again, it gave me the chance to 
delve into what being middle class 
really means and start an honest 
conversation on the topic. My 
mistake allowed me, and hopefully 
others, to learn.

Online, my naïve perception of 

wealth was called the “Problem 
with America.” In the real world, 
there are a lot of problems with 
America, which, with any luck, 
can be fixed by learning from a 
 

few mistakes.

BOOK REVIEW
Poignant, political
‘Civilizations’

Mohsin Hamid’s 
new collection of 

essays offers cultural 

critique

By KARL WILLIAMS

For The Daily

Pakistani novelist and essayist 

Mohsin Hamid’s (“The Reluctant 
Fundamentalist,” “How to Get 
Filthy Rich in Rising Asia”) 
newest 
book 

“Discontent and 
Its Civilizations: 
Dispatches 
from 
Lahore, 

New York, and 
London” 
is 
a 

collection 
of 

essays 
written 

over 
the 
last 

15 
years. 

Referencing 
Sigmund Freud’s 
seminal 
work, 

“Civilization and 
Its Discontents,” 
Hamid’s book concerns itself 
with the various moral, political 
and aesthetic problems in post-
9/11, globalized society. 

Although 
originally 
from 

Pakistan, 
Hamid 
has 
been 

frequently displaced: he has lived 
invariably in New York, London 
and 
Lahore. 
Displacement 

features heavily in his essays; 
displacement is a primary feature 
of the “brutal phenomenon” 
called 
globalization, 
which 

“brings us mass displacement, 
wars, 
terrorism, 
unchecked 

financial capitalism, inequality, 
xenophobia, climate change.” 
Home 
has 
become 
an 

increasingly problematic notion 
and 
increasingly 
difficult 

to 
define. 
Hamid 
himself 

declares that he has “always 
felt (himself) a half-outsider.” 
However, Hamid notes that 
cultural 
delineations 
have 

become illusory as that brutal 
phenomenon 
has 
grown 
in 

compass:

“Yet 
what 
are 
these 

civilizations, these notions of 
Muslim-ness, 
Western-ness, 

European-ness, American-ness, 
that attempt to describe where, 
and with whom, we belong? They 
are illusions: arbitrarily drawn 

constructions 
with 
porous, 

brittle and overlapping borders.”

This theme permeates each 

of the essays in the book and 
provides 
Hamid’s 
greatest 

insights. In moments like these, 
Hamid’s voice reaches a pitch 
where its power soars. There is 
profundity without grandiosity, 
bravery without imprudence.

Pakistan, both its political 

aspects and its personal impacts 
on the individual, is the subject 
of about half of the essays in 
the book. As both a Pakistani 
and a Muslim, Hamid is at his 
best when analyzing his birth-
country and his religion. Hamid 
fiercely 
combats 
the 
inane 

representations 
of 
Muslims 

that are frequently perpetuated 
in the West: “There are more 
than a billion variations of lived 
belief among people who define 
themselves as Muslim — one 
for each human being.” He 
emphasizes that religion isn’t a 
collective experience; it is reified 
by the individual. He denounces 
Islamophobia, and declares it 
as illogical and repugnant as 
racism. 
Islamophobia 
denies 

hybridity, variation and agency 
among every one who considers 
themselves a Muslim. It abstracts 
the individual from their own 
humanity and homogenizes them 
into a whole, thereby erasing 
what makes them human. The 
logic of Islamophobia doesn’t 
make sense, “For individuals 
are undeniably real. Groups, on 
the other hand, are assertions of 
opinion.”

In the titular essay, Hamid 

elucidates 
the 
mythological 

and 
utilitarian 
qualities 
of 

civilization: “They (civilizations) 
allow us to deny our common 
humanity, to allocate power, 
resources and rights in ways 
repugnantly 
discriminatory.” 

The notion of civilizations as 

disparate, dichotomized entities 
allows phenomena like slavery, 
genocide and colonialism to 
occur. It allows the innocent 
deaths of hundreds of Pakistani 
civilians at the hands of U.S. 
drones with barely a quiver of 
anger in the West while the vapid 
words of a pop star can cause 
eruptions of mass outrage. It is 
the conceptions of difference 
that create conflict, not inherent 
human difference. Hamid fights 
for humanitarian ideals in his 
essays, and he does so with prose 
that is utterly persuasive and 
with a voice that seems to carry 
the truth. 

While Hamid plays the role 

of political dissident frequently 
throughout his collection, he 
also plays a multitude of other 
roles: student, aesthete, father, 
moviegoer, etc. The collection 
does not always hold the severity 
and gravity of his political essays. 
There are lighthearted stories 
here too, such as one where he 
makes Toni Morrison pasta or 
another where his first child is 
born. His views on life and art 
are interesting as well, although 
undoubtedly not as fascinating as 
his political commentary. 

Not 
only 
does 
he 
dispel 

political myths, but he tears down 
the edifice of an infamous literary 
myth: the Great American Novel. 
Propelled by the question of the 
Great American Novel written by 
a women, Hamid finds that the 
categorization of literature into 
neat boxes opposes literature’s 
purpose. Hamid writes, “It’s 
a mistake to ask literature 
to reinforce such structures. 
Literature tends to crack them. 
Literature is where we free 
ourselves.” The Great American 
Novel is an impossibility because 
literature destroys the artifice 
that creates ideas like American-
ness 
or 
European-ness. 

Literature doesn’t create the 
borders of exclusion; it destroys 
them.

Hamid’s collection of essays 

displays a trenchant skill at 
cultural 
analysis. 
He 
writes 

with a pen that cuts through 
the illusory and exclusionary 
demarcations of culture. He 
advocates for the individual and 
the humanitarian. Hamid is a 
brave and acute writer, and these 
essays are ample evidence.

He tears down 

the edifice 
of the Great 

American Novel.

The importance of 
realism in film

FILM NOTEBOOK

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

As cinema evolves, movies 

seem to increasingly aim for 
realism. In 2014 alone, we’ve 
seen “Wild,” a movie that guides 
the 
audience 
through 
every 

grueling 
moment 
of 
Cheryl 

Strayed’s 1000-mile journey. For 
every 
breakneck 
blockbuster 

like 
“Edge 
of 
Tomorrow,” 

there’s a slower-paced movie 
like “Happy Christmas,” which 
uses Joe Swanberg’s signature 
improvised dialogue. Even the 
sci-fi flick “Coherence” aims for 
naturalism — director James 
Ward Byrkit let his actors play 
off each other without a script, 
and some of their frightened 
reactions are legitimate. Still, the 
film that most people recognize 
as an accurate depiction of 
reality is Richard Linklater’s 
“Boyhood.”

“Boyhood” 
is 
such 
an 

important 
film 
because 
it 

eschews plot almost entirely in 
favor of the day-to-day. In a time 
when filmmakers are pushing 
the boundaries of what film can 
do, the most experimental thing 
to do, ironically, is portray life 
realistically. There’s one 2014 
film that does this even more 
than “Boyhood,” though: “The 
Strange Little Cat.”

Directed, written and edited 

by 
Swiss 
filmmaker 
Ramon 

Zürcher, “The Strange Little 
Cat” tells the story of one day 
in a cramped Berlin apartment. 
Starting in the morning and 
ending in the evening, the movie 
is 
essentially 
plotless; 
over 

the course of the afternoon, 
extended 
family 
members 

arrive and join in what seems 
to be a casual family dinner 
party. There’s Mother (Jenny 
Schily, 
“Sleeping 
Sickness”), 

who spends most of the movie 
staring into space, suggesting 
some sort of inner turmoil that 
never gets explained. There’s 
Simon (newcomer Luk Pfaff) 
and Karin (Anjorka Strechel, 
“My Friend from Faro”), the two 
visiting older siblings, and Clara 
(Mia Kasalo, “Die Kinder meiner 
Tochter”), a little girl who 
screams whenever the coffee 
grinder turns on.

Many viewers might be bored 

by the movie, considering there’s 
pretty much no conflict. Luckily, 
at 72 minutes, it feels pretty 
tight and short, and in that short 
amount of time, the film is able 
to do some really fascinating 
things.

“The Strange Little Cat” isn’t 

interested in the passage of time 
and change like “Boyhood” is, 
but it’s intrigued by finding the 
mystery and oddity in mundane 
moments. Mother tells a story 
about a man in a movie theater 
whose foot rested on hers without 
his knowledge. Karin tells a story 
about flicking pieces of orange 
peel, which always land with 
the white side facing up. These 
are simple, ordinary things that 
happen, but the way the stories 
are articulated, there’s a sense of 
strangeness, of otherworldliness. 
It sounds pretentious to say that a 
movie explores the beauty in the 
mundaneness of everyday life, 
but that’s really what this does.

Rather 
than 
switching 

between characters during a 
dialogue, Zürcher usually keeps 
the camera focused on one 
person: the listener, more often 
than not. It feels psychologically 
probing, 
and 
the 
characters 

become incredibly intimate to us 
just because we’re seeing them 
in an unusual position. Modern 
cinema 
has 
shortened 
our 

attention spans and allowed our 
eyes to dart between all the faces 

in the room in any given scene, so 
it’s refreshing to see the camera 
remain on one person for a long 
period of time.

There’s one character in the 

film, Jonas (newcomer Leon 
Alan Beiersdorf), a young cousin 
who stands in doorways and 
just observes everything else 
going on with a blank look on 
his face. As undeveloped as the 
character is, I felt a kinship with 
him as I watched the long shots 
of his unchanging expression. 
It 
reminded 
me 
of 
every 

Thanksgiving — the moments 
when I’d lean against the wall 
and watch my family hurrying 
around the house in the early 
afternoon, 
preparing 
dinner, 

sometimes stopping to socialize, 
conversations peppered with big 
guffaws or small chuckles. No 
other film in recent memory has 
captured watching and listening 
as well as “The Strange Little 
Cat.”

Sometimes it seems like we 

always think of life in such broad 
terms. When we watch our movies 
or TV and read our books, we look 
for commentary on big, important 
concepts like love, hate, God, war, 
success and failure. It makes sense 
that we’d want a movie to give us 
a new perspective on something 
important, but too often, that 
makes us forget everything else. 
Things like a stranger’s foot or the 
white side of an orange peel may 
seem inconsequential, but they 
become important through the 
sheer amount of space and time 
they take up in our lives.

I think that’s why I loved 

“Boyhood,” and why I love “The 
Strange Little Cat.” These films 
seek to illuminate the parts of life 
that we never bother exploring 
because we’re always concerned 
with bigger things. Sometimes, 
though, we need to just pause and 
take everything in.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Background music?

By CLAIRE WOOD

For The Daily

Oftentimes, music sits in the 

background. It plays, and we lis-
ten — but not really.

Sometimes, that’s where it 

belongs. While it may not seem in 
the background (frat grooves tend 
toward the rambunctious side), 2 
a.m. party tunes certainly don’t 
take the forefront of our minds. 
Take Ke$ha, for instance. The 
only discernible impact of her 
2012 release “Timber” is a mys-
teriously intense desire to jump 
up and down repeatedly. Jason 
Derulo contemplates how women 
“fit all that in them jeans,” and 
the Spice Girls announce that 
they “really really wanna zig a zig 
aaah.” What is zig-a-zigging, any-
way? No clue, but the beat is fun 
and the melody is catchy, so we 
dance. 

Don’t get me wrong — I love 

the latest pop. And it’s no secret 
that college life is stressful. With 
packed schedules, tough academ-
ics and social lives, sometimes the 
only thing we want is to “Wiggle, 
Wiggle, Wiggle.” The Top 40 has 
flashy percussion and singable 
lines, and it’s just what we need. 
That’s what it’s there for: enter-
tainment. 

And then, out of nowhere, some 

songs hit you square on. 

The first time I heard Mackl-

emore’s 2012 single “Same Love,” 
I was pulling into an H.E.B. park-
ing lot. 

“America the brave still fears 

what we don’t know.”

I’m stuck — transfixed. I sit in 

my car, pulled between the paint-
ed yellow lines, listening. Mackl-
emore has caught me off guard. 
It’s a simple sentence, yet the 

potency is overwhelming. There 
is a beautiful juxtaposition to the 
work — gentle piano, soft drum, 
mellow vocals against scathing 
words. “Have you read the You-
Tube comments lately?” Mackl-
emore asks. “The holy water that 
you soak in has been poisoned,” 
he warns. “Press play, don’t press 
pause,” he commands. His words 
sting with truth.

“Same Love” criticizes public 

social norms and questions the 
righteousness of our morals. The 
lyrics impress on us to act. Mackl-
emore doesn’t zig-a-zig with the 
Spice Girls or question female 
curvature with Mr. Derulo. He 
sends us a message. 

Two years later, Hozier shocks 

pop culture with his 2014 release 
“Take Me to Church.” The sound 
is as enticing as any chart-climb-
ing hit; the lyrics, however, define 
it as more. “Every Sunday’s get-
ting more bleak / a fresh poison 
each week,” Hozier sings. We 
hardly recognize the bitterness 
beneath the rhyming parallel-
ism. “I’ll worship like a dog at the 
shrine of your lies” — and we hear 
it again: a sharp religious criti-

cism masked by a groovy beat and 
strong vocals. Low piano backs 
accusations of “poisonous” cor-
ruption. Denunciation of reli-
gious deceit spills over tapping 
percussion. 

It is this meaningful quality that 

makes “Same Love” and “Take Me 
to Church” more than background 
music. They are not meant for late 
night dances or for the bar on the 
corner. These songs stop small 
talk. They make you hush your 
friends and turn up the volume. 
They make you sit extra long in the 
grocery store parking lot because 
Macklemore is speaking, and you 
certainly aren’t about to leave. 

Macklemore and Hozier are 

not alone. Artists across the world 
challenge us with their works. 
Nina Simone requested freedom 
in 1967, wishing to “break all the 
chains holding me.” John Len-
non called for a new world in 1971, 
directing us to “Imagine all the 
people, living life in peace.” It’s the 
difference between Carly Rae Jep-
son’s “Call Me Maybe” and a call to 
action. Some songs sing — not to 
make you jump up and squeal, but 
to make you stand up and speak.

FILM COLUMN

Scared shitless 

This column is inspired by 

Andrew Eckhous’s The ‘Nevers’ and 
the ‘Haven’ts’.
I

’m scared shitless, you guys. 
I’m that girl on the cover 
of the “Scream” poster, 

the one with her hand over her 
mouth that 
most Yahoo 
Answers 
users seem 
to agree is 
Drew Bar-
rymore. 
I’m Jessica 
Biel, loping 
through 
clothes-
line after 
clothesline 
as the hot 
Texas sun swelters down my back 
as a chainsaw-wielding psycho-
path tries to turn me into living 
room upholstery. Of course, in 
this interpretation, Leatherface 
is Engineering Dean Dave Mun-
son and his chainsaw is a freshly 
inked college degree, hellbent on 
making my existence as excit-
ing as a stick of celery in a Xerox 
machine. 

I’m terrified because in approx-

imately seven weeks, I will be sit-
ting shoulder-to-shoulder with 
thousands of other 20-some-
things, all scared shitless, while 
an old white person stands on 
a stage to make speeches about 
the future. I’m scared shitless 
because, in all likelihood, that 
same old white person made a 
version of The Future Speech last 
year, and will be doing so again in 
12 months as he stares down the 
next legion of 20-somethings, all 
scared shitless.

The funny thing is, I wasn’t all 

that bothered a couple days ago. 
Senioritis had set in the summer 
before fall term. And a sizeable 
portion of my soul was very much 
occupied counting down the 
maximum number of spaces on an 
Ahmo’s meal card I could check 
off before leaving Ann Arbor for 
good. Was I a little glum? Sure. It’s 
Ahmo’s. But still, no poo had yet 
been lost. 

Until, in the span of 24 hours, 

I devoured a three-course meal 
inventively labeled ‘Hollybrown-
wood.’ It roared out of the gates 
with Aziz Ansari’s “Live At Madi-
son Square Garden,” followed 

closely by a double whammy of 
Dev Patel — first, Neil Blomkamp’s 
“Chappie,” and then Some British 
Guy’s “The Second Best Marigold 
Hotel.” Watching all three in close 
succession is a bit like jumping off 
the Taj Mahal. Or, more accurate-
ly, jumping off the Empire State 
Building and through the dome of 
a Trump Organization Taj Mahal 
in Las Vegas. It’s smile-inducing 
hearing Ansari seemingly dig into 
issues of race, a topic his previous 
material always kinda prodded but 
never really managed to craft to 
its own designs. 

I say seemingly because, at first, 

the ‘being Indian’ jokes punch 
along with the typical irrever-
ence we’ve come to expect from 
an hour of his comedy — heartfelt 
story followed by “That’s what 
you have to do when you’re an 
immigrant: Handle your shit! Kill 
some racist motherfuckers when 
you need to.” He’s letting the 
air out of the tires, deflating the 
stakes in the same way he’s been 
doing for a decade. And yet, for 
the first time, he offers us a reason 
why, as succinct as it is blunt: “I’m 
never going to have any of these 
stories to tell my kids about. Are 
you kidding me? My life is super 
easy because my parents did all 
the suffering for me.” 

The next hour is a brisk jaunt 

through relationship advice, the 
inherent creepiness of the male 
sex and a Ja Rule impression so 
good I googled Ja Rule for the first 
time in five years and learned he 
was born on a leap day and raised a 
Jehovah’s Witness by his mother. 
Not so much as a callback to racial 
commentary until the show ends 
in a hail of confetti. Ansari calls 
his parents onto the stage, wraps 
his arms around them and clasps 
the mic with his father’s hands.

The first time I saw it, I cried. 

Not really, but I did walk away 
(closed the Netflix tab) with a feel-
ing that ‘maybe Hollywood isn’t 
out to get my people’ (an actual 
note now scrawled on a corner 
of Ahmo’s wrapping paper), to 
pigeonhole them or glaze them 
into the fine, digestible pow-
der of stereotypes. I didn’t walk 
away with any sort of realiza-
tion, but with an acceptance that 
this 
unperturbed 
star-making 

machine — that almost never 
launches Indian-American tal-
ent — maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t 
caught in a tug-of-war: That grap-
ple between the burden of honest-
ly representing problems facing 
‘my people’ or shoving them under 
the table. Does Aziz have to talk 
about being Indian just because 
he is Indian? 

By boasting “my last three roles 

were Randy, Chet and Tom” at 
Comedy Central’s roast of James 
Franco, is he thumbing his nose 

at the fact that most people can’t 
fill 10 fingers with the names of 
recognizable brown stars work-
ing today. That there simply are 
no parts tailored for Indians? That 
“Slumdog Millionaire,” told by a 
white British guy, is and will for-
ever be the last semi-interesting 
movie you saw about people from 
my country?

I’m scared shitless, you guys. 

I’m scared shitless because in 
approximately seven weeks, I will 
no longer have a sounding board. I 
will no longer be able to sit down, 
put these questions on a piece 
of paper and have people look 
at them, think about them, even 
if for only a couple minutes. But 
above all, I’m terrified because an 
industry I want so desperately to 
be a part of still hasn’t answered 
them. 

Aziz’s specials have a calming 

effect. Any short man jittering 
around on stage impersonating a 
rapper is bound to. But this hour, 
and especially those first few 
minutes of jokes, went further 
because they were like his hand 
over my shoulder, a click in my 
brain that Aziz is being Aziz. He is 
saying “Maybe I’m not the vessel 
for your questions, as important as 
they may be. I haven’t really faced 
the harsh realities of racism. My 
parents made sure of that. Maybe 
I need to be the person I want to 
be.”

“Slumdog Millionaire” is a 

movie I try to rewatch at least 
once a year. A) Because it’s a great 
fucking film, brilliant in its level 
of craftsmanship and smarter still 
in the depth of its performances. 
And B) Because it reminds me of 
what was the first and may be the 
last time in my life I get to watch 
an Indian man perform a song on 
Hollywood’s biggest stage on Hol-
lywood’s biggest night. Then walk 
away with Hollywood’s greatest 
award. The film’s success gave my 
high hopes for its star’s, Dev Patel, 
career. He had been in virtually 
every frame of the picture. More 
than anything or anyone else, he 
had been the its emotional center-
piece, the needle round which the 
compass was built. 

I thought Hollywood would 

write movies to accommodate 
him. That the strength of this 
showing would prove this high-
lighted sliver of Indian culture is 
more than some exotic sideshow, 
enjoyed, lauded for one awards 
season and forgotten in the next. 
I wasn’t right. And Dev Patel’s 
career arc since “Slumdog” has 
been a storage bank of the reasons 
why.

Part two of this column will be 

posted online on Sunday night.

TV NOTEBOOK

Hilarity is everlasting 
at Chicago’s Second 

City improv 

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Tucked into a creaking corner 

of Chicago, a comedy club called 
The Second City waits for the sun 
to set and the stage to light up. 
My boyfriend and I had booked 
two tickets for the Sunday night 
show as a sort of grand finale for 
spring break in the Windy City. 
After dutifully shivering at the 
snowy Bean, stuffing ourselves 
with 
deep 
dish 
pizza 
and 

sipping expensive Intelligentsia 
coffee, one tradition of Chicago 
still remained unchecked: the 
comedy scene — specifically, 
improvisational 
comedy, 

trademarked 
through 

generations of talented actors 
at The Second City, whose 
sketches laid the foundation for 
NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and 
launched dozens of stars into 
funnyman fame. 

If you haven’t heard of Second 

City, the performers probably 
wouldn’t blame you (though 
fans, including myself, may be 
seriously offended). In the late 
1950s, a misfit acting troupe made 
its mark on the seedy outskirts 
of the University of Chicago, 
performing 
short 
comedy 

skits in the back of a bar called 
Compass. Though the gig began 
as a gimmick to sell more drinks, 
the “Compass Players” quickly 
grew 
in 
popularity 
because 

of 
their 
unique 
interaction 

with the audience: instead of 
strictly following script, the 
players would act out audience 
suggestions 
with 
on-spot 

improvisation. 
These 
scenes 

combined to set a movement into 
motion — timely, organic comedy, 
performed on a bare stage, with 
only bar stools as props. 

Heavily influenced by the 

Compass Players, The Second 
City soon opened its doors, 
housed in a cheaply renovated 
laundromat. It was 1959 and 
tides were shifting — Democrats 
were growing under charismatic 
John F. Kennedy a few years 
before his presidency, the Civil 

Rights Movement was underway 
and love was on the minds of 
righteous, Elvis-rocking teens 
— staging a perfect storm of 
satirical comedy to sweep the 
nation. 

The Second City wave wasn’t 

a one-hit wonder, nor were the 
actors it whipped out through 
the decades, among them Bill 
Murray (“Ghostbusters”), Mike 
Myers (“Austin Powers”), Steve 
Carell (“The Office”), Jason 
Sudeikis (“We’re the Millers”) 
and my personal favorite, Tina 
Fey (“Date Night”). Though the 
lineup has shifted, replacing 
now-famous stars with the fresh 
faces we saw on Sunday night, 
the show’s essence remains: in 
the end, it’s all about the actors 
and 
the 
audience, 
together 

seeking humor through laughs 
and flops. 

As Bill Murray said in an 

interview with the late Roger 
Ebert in 1990: “The reason so 
many Second City people have 
been successful is really fairly 
simple. At the heart of it is the 
idea that if you make the other 
actors look good, you’ll look 

good. It works sort of like the 
idea of life after death. If you live 
an exemplary life, trying to make 
someone else look good, you’ll 
look good too. It braces you up, 
when you’re out there with that 
fear of death, which is really the 
difference between the Second 
City actors and the others.” 

In her book “Bossypants,” 

Tina Fey also comments on 
the unrelenting stage and the 
mutual trust between players: “I 
always liken it to basketball. If 
you get passed to once in a game, 
you have to learn to make that 
basket or you don’t get passed to 
again.”

Both Fey and Murray would 

later be plucked from Chicago 
and dropped in New York for 
“Saturday Night Live,” Lorne 
Michaels’ live sketch comedy 
show that first aired in 1975 
and recently celebrated its 40th 
anniversary. Fey would soon 
become the show’s head writer 
and a comedic icon. Murray 
would replace Chevy Chase 
(“National Lampoon’s Family 
Vacation”) and catapult his way 
to fame, proving that talent 
remains even when a star leaves. 

Perhaps the most remarkable 

thing about “SNL” is how it 
strikes a subject with pinpoint 
precision, year after 40 years — 
a feat that can only come from 
hours of practice on a tiny stage, 
whether in a dingy bar or the 
spotlighted Second City theater, 
using the energy of the audience 
to feed the flame.

Rick Owens
disrupts norm

PARIS FASHION WEEK RECAP

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Rick Owens told the Los Ange-

les Times that he calls his clothes 
his “diary and biography.” After 
dropping out of Otis College of 
Art and Design, Owens said “fuck 
it” and enrolled in a nondescript 
trade college to learn patterns 
and how to drape — dude just 
wanted to roll up his sleeves. And 
so began his line that would’ve 
left 
ancient 
Greek 
maidens, 

Middle-earth warrior chicks and 
the showgirls in Kubrick’s “Eyes 
Wide Shut” agape. It’d be naive 
to call him derivative, as each 
piece, no more influenced than it 
is fresh, communicates his fasci-
nation with time and how solemn 
it can be.

His “diary” actually pulls from 

all of these areas — dark and vio-
lent and mystic — and even his 
own Mexican blood. His dusty 
and fringed moccasin-like deer-
skin pieces swallow his models, 
wrapping them with asymmet-
ric twists without suffocating 
or tightening gaits. Replete with 
quiet granite beiges, impenetra-
ble blacks and lukewarm beiges, 
Owens tapers virtually nothing 
and drapes everything. He mar-

ries Roman tunics with skirts that 
hang ankle-length up front while 
cut at the knees in the back — both 
a way to showcase his form-fit 
boots and lock-in breathability.

The collection plays with 

shoulders over all else, Owens 
seeing them as the vertex for 
functionality and ingenuity. He 
hits extremes when one piece 
boxes in its wearer, shoulders 
jutting straight out nearly a 
foot, reminiscent of “Dr. Cal-
gari” ’s somnambulist. When 
he’s not inflating the shoulders, 
he just gives them wings, as the 
back fabric spreads out, leav-
ing the fronts of the arms still 
exposed. No matter the cut, you 
can bank Owens will rattle the 
cage with oblique seams to dis-
rupt when things get too paral-
lel, too perfect.

Owens tapers 

virtually 

nothing ,drapes 

everything.

Rivalry to determine title

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team’s 

weekend series against Michigan 
State is kind of a big deal.

With a Big Ten championship, 

rivalry 
bragging 
rights, 

tournament seeding and senior 
pride on the line, the 19th-ranked 
Wolverines have plenty to play 
for 
in 
their 

regular-season 
finale.

“I’ve heard 

it from many 
different guys 
— this is why 
you come to 
Michigan,” 
said sophomore 
forward 
JT 

Compher. 
“It’s 
almost 

storybook, two 
games against 
your rival for a 
championship. 
All of our goals 
can 
still 
be 

accomplished. 
You have no 
reason not to be excited.”

That excitement begins Friday 

evening, when Michigan (11-7 Big 
Ten, 19-13 overall) travels to East 
Lansing to battle the Spartans 
(10-6-2, 16-14-2) before returning 
to Ann Arbor for the senior class’ 
final game at Yost Ice Arena.

Both games will be of equal 

importance, as the Big Ten 
regular-season title hinges on 
this weekend’s results. Michigan 
State (34 points) and Michigan 
(33) can clinch with sweeps, 
or they can relegate control to 
Minnesota (33) or Penn State 
(31), who play head to head in 
Minneapolis.

Adding to the intrigue are 

the 
contrasting 
strengths 

between the rivals. As strong and 
dominant as Michigan’s offense 
— No. 1 nationally — has been 
this season, Michigan State’s 

defense has looked even more 
potent as of late. The Spartans 
posted consecutive shutouts last 
weekend, and they have allowed 
16 fewer goals than any other 
team in conference play.

With 
netminder 
Jake 

Hildebrand garnering national 
attention for his recent play in 
goal, the Wolverines have their 
work cut out for them.

“He’s the best goalie in our 

league,” said junior forward 
Andrew Copp. “He’s going to stop 
what he can see, so we need to 
get bodies in front and traffic in 
front and then bang in rebounds 
and do what we can to disrupt his 
rhythm and flow to the game.”

Added Michigan coach Red 

Berenson: “We’ve got a lot of 
respect for their team defense 
and their goalie. Their team is 
playing their best hockey in a 
couple years, and good for them. 
It was a matter of time, so now 
we’ve got to play our best hockey.”

Though 
Michigan 
State’s 

aggressive defense has been 
known 
to 
shake 
up 
team’s 

rhythms, Michigan feels that, at 
this point in the season, the talent 

is there. Now, it’s time to put it 
together and execute.

“We need to play our game and 

play up to our potential,” Copp 
said. “Obviously we need to know 
their system and how to beat it, 
but if we play up to our potential 
and do what we’re supposed to 
do, that’s all we need.”

Due to bad losses in the second 

half of Big Ten play, Michigan 
likely won’t be able to clinch 
an at-large bid to the NCAA 
Tournament 
this 
weekend, 

instead relying on next weekend’s 
Big Ten Tournament to punch its 
ticket.

But as the storied rivals battle 

in search of a storybook ending, 
the Wolverines know they can 
write their own script.

“We know all the things that 

are at stake, but our number one 
goal is to play our best on Friday,” 
Berenson said. “We’ve got to go in 
and start better, execute better, 
compete better, and then we’ll 
worry about the outcome. If we 
don’t play well, we’ll get what we 
deserve.

“We’re in a good spot, and now 

we’ve got to live up to it.”

Harbaugh’s first spring 
marked by competition

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

After the Michigan football 

team’s practice Thursday, fifth-
year senior cornerback Blake 
Countess recounted a story 
Baltimore Ravens coach John 
Harbaugh told the Wolverines. 
The brother of Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh is in Ann Arbor 
to 
speak 
at 
a 
high-school 

coaches clinic Friday but took a 
few minutes Thursday to speak 
to his sibling’s team.

According 
to 
Countess’ 

version of John’s tale, wrestling 
was a regular occurrence in the 
Harbaugh household when the 
brothers were growing up. The 
wrestling matches were of a 
cyclical nature. John is exactly 
15 months older than Jim, so 
he tended to hit growth spurts 
first and win the brotherly 
battles. But then Jim would 
grow and defeat his brother, 
ending his temporary reign. 
The process always seemed to 
repeat itself.

John might have thought 

the fighting ended when the 
brothers grew up, but that 
wasn’t the case in his brother’s 
mind. When Jim played in the 
National Football League and 
John was in the earlier stages 
of his coaching career, Jim took 
the entire family on vacation 
to Amelia Island, Florida. Jim, 
known 
for 
his 
competitive 

nature, used the beach as a 
chance to get the last word, to 
right the perceived wrongs of 
his youth.

The brothers wrestled in the 

sand and Jim won the match, 
dunking John into the sand.

“That was just crazy to me, 

that they were fighting as grown 

men,” Countess said.

Jim 
Harbaugh 
has 
been 

working this spring to apply 
that fighter’s mentality to his 
football team. At the end of 
every practice, a winner and 
loser are declared between 
the offense and defense. The 
way Harbaugh “rewards” the 
winning group adds to the 
drama.

The winning unit, not the 

losing one, is tasked with 
running 
gassers 
for 
about 

10 minutes after the day’s 
activities. It’s not meant as a 
punishment. 
In 
Harbaugh’s 

world, only the winners deserve 
the opportunity to get better. 
The losing side sits down to 
watch the winners run.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith was one of the many 
players who originally thought 
running was a punishment 
for not succeeding in practice. 
It took fewer than five spring 
practices to reverse Smith’s 
mentality. The offense’s losses 
weigh 
on 
Smith 
when 
he 

watches his teammates run.

He had never previously 

entertained the idea that he 
would have a desire to run 
gassers.

“No, not at all,” Smith said. 

“There’s not a chance, ever. 
Last summer, we had a gasser 
test and that was the worst 
thing, I hated gassers. Seeing 
your teammates run the gassers 
instead of you because you lost 
is kind of frustrating.”

The competition is even more 

magnified on special teams. 
Each rep is viewed as a one-on-
one battle between two players, 
resulting in the declaration 
of a winner and loser. Like 
on offense and defense, the 

winners of many drills run.

The coaches make sure the 

final results are distinct. Middle 
ground is nonexistent.

“We know who won and we 

know who lost,” said redshirt 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Jehu 

Chesson.

But 
winning 
the 
spring 

practice battles may become a 
bit more difficult for Michigan’s 
offense after Thursday’s news 
that fifth-year senior offensive 
lineman 
Jack 
Miller 
won’t 

return for his fifth season. 
Miller started all 12 of the 
team’s games at center last 
season, carving out a role as a 
team leader.

In a letter posted to his 

Twitter account, Miller cited 
a desire to start a new chapter 
of his life, stating that he had 
already accomplished all of 
his football-related goals at 
Michigan. He told ESPN that 
his decision had nothing to do 
with the team’s new coaching 
staff.

According to players made 

available to the media after 
practice Thursday, fifth-year 
senior Graham Glasgow has 
taken over many of Miller’s 
reps. Glasgow started 11 of the 
Wolverines’ games last season 
at guard. In 2013, Glasgow 
started nine games at center.

Glasgow will have plenty of 

time before the season opener 
on Sept. 3 to readjust to the 
position, if he ends up being the 
one charged with filling Miller’s 
position.

His offensive teammates can 

only hope that the adjustment 
doesn’t take too long. A delay 
would mean more days of 
watching the defense run its 
victory gassers.

The top-seeded 
Badgers await 

Michigan in second-

round matchup

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO 
— 
When 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
took on Illinois in the second 
round of the Big Ten tournament 

Thursday, it was a team with 
nothing to lose versus one with 
everything to lose.

And in the Wolverines 73-55 

blowout win, “nothing to lose” 
prevailed. Buoyed by a burst of 
energy at the start, Michigan 
was all over a sluggish Illini 
team from the opening tip.

Friday, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines will face a much 
stiffer test when they take on No. 
1 seed Wisconsin. The Badgers 
have only NCAA Tournament 
seeding position on the line, and 

with their smart, veteran lineup, 
they’re a safe 
bet 
to 
be 

steady on the 
big stage at the 
United Center.

But with a 

resounding 
win 
over 

the Illini in 
hand, 
the 

Wolverines 
aren’t ready to concede to the 
tournament favorites.

“I think we match up pretty 

good,” said freshman forward 
Kameron Chatman. “I think 
we’re gonna come out with the 
same energy we did today and 
hopefully get the victory. … 
We’re not ready to go home yet.”

The last time Michigan met 

the Badgers — a 69-64 Wisconsin 
win on Jan. 24 — just about 
everything was different for 
the Wolverines. They were still 
searching for an identity after 
junior 
guard 
Caris 
LeVert’s 

season-ending 
foot 
injury, 

and sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. was still in the lineup.

Friday, with Walton doubtful, 

the Wolverines will be relying 

on sophomore guard Zak Irvin, 

junior 
guard 

Spike Albrecht 
and freshman 
guard Aubrey 
Dawkins 
for 

their 
offense. 

To be fair, they 
were 
leaning 

on those three 
in 
the 
last 

meeting 
too. 

But Friday, the three are much 
safer bets to generate offense.

Against 
the 
Illini, 
Irvin 

finished with 14 points, six 
rebounds and six assists. He 
made plays he wouldn’t have 
dreamed of making in late 
January, with timely passes 
through traffic and rebounds 
over much taller players.

He scored 12 points on 5-for-

15 shooting in the earlier game 
against Wisconsin. Now, he’s 
evolved to a level where the 
Badgers won’t be able to rely on 
him simply throwing up a prayer 
with the shot clock dwindling.

At 
the 
other 
wing 
spot, 

Dawkins has developed into 
a reliable shooter, a far cry 
from his three points on 1-for-3 

shooting in January.

But while this isn’t the same 

Michigan team, this is the same 
Wisconsin team. And that’s what 
the Wolverines will be worried 
about.

“They’re 
an 
extremely 

good team, they’re extremely 
fundamental and they can all 
shoot,” Albrecht said. “We’re just 
going to need to do some things 
to keep them to mix up defenses, 
keep them out of a good rhythm.

“That’s the one thing about 

Wisconsin: 
They 
don’t 
beat 

themselves. You’re going to have 
to beat them.”

The Badgers trot out a starting 

five that includes a National 
Player of the Year candidate in 
seven-footer Frank Kaminsky, a 
bona fide scorer in Sam Dekker, 
an athletic swingman in Nigel 
Hayes and a gifted backcourt 
of Josh Gasser and Bronson 
Koenig.

With those five, Wisconsin 

can score from anywhere on the 
court. And it does. Kaminsky 
is one of the deadliest inside-
outside threats in the nation, and 
he had a 22-point field day the 
last time he took on Michigan.

The tall task 

of 
guarding 

him 
could 

go 
to 
senior 

forward 
Max 

Bielfeldt, 
who 

has 
somehow 

been 
able 
to 

outperform 
bigger 
centers 

multiple 
times 

this 
season. 

But 
Kaminsky 

is 
a 
different 

animal.

“We’ve done a little cross-

matching in the past where we 
put the ‘4’ on him and the ‘5’ 
on Nigel Hayes,” Bielfeldt said. 
“(We’ll) try to force him to do 
things he doesn’t want to do and 
just go from there.”

It 
starts 
with 
keeping 

Kaminsky in check, but the 
Wolverines will need a herculean 
effort to upset the Badgers. 
They’ll need to do everything 
right and force Wisconsin to 
make mistakes.

But they’ve still got nothing 

to lose. And with a win over 
Wisconsin, 
they 
could 
have 

everything to gain.

Michigan opens the 
Big Ten Tournament 
with a blowout win 

over Illinois

CHICAGO — The last time the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
was on the court against Illinois, 
exactly 
one 
month 
ago, 
the 

Wolverines looked flustered.

They coughed up a lead in the 

final minute of regulation and 
were outscored in overtime, 14-2, 
losing at the State Farm Center.

The 
rubber 
match 
was 

Thursday at the United Center 
in the Big Ten Tournament, and 
Michigan (8-10 Big Ten, 16-15 
overall) didn’t look scared one bit 
in a 73-55 rout of Illinois (9-9 Big 
Ten, 19-13 overall).

Sophomore forward Zak Irvin 

spotted up and hit a long 3-pointer, 
freshman 
guard 
Muhammad-

Ali Abdur Rahkman drove at 
Illinois center Nnanna Egwu for 
a layup and the Wolverines forced 
repeated bad shots on the other 
end — and that was just before the 
first media timeout.

“They just threw the first 

punch, and we was just unable 
to answer,” said Illinois guard 
Rayvonte Rice. “Just gave it all we 
got. They were just a better team.”

Michigan disappeared for the 

next few minutes, but that ended 
up being little more than a hiccup. 
It pulled ahead in the opening 
minutes, 12-2, before losing the 
lead 
entirely, 
then 
recovered 

quickly going into halftime ahead 
40-23.

Within six minutes, Illinois 

turned the 12-2 deficit into a 
15-14 lead after a 3-pointer by 
Malcolm Hill. But the Wolverines 
never wavered, answering right 
away with junior guard Spike 
Albrecht’s 3-pointer to spark a 
17-2 run and take the pro-Illinois 
crowd out of it for good.

“That was the best part of the 

game to me — when we were up 
big, and they ended up answering, 
and we went right back up big,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“That showed a lot of growth.”

Michigan had another double-

digit lead — and this one stuck. The 
final result was the Wolverines’ 
third-largest margin of victory in 
a Big Ten Tournament game, as 
well as Illinois’ largest margin of 
defeat.

Michigan now has under 24 

hours to prepare for a quarterfinal 
matchup 
with 
No. 
1 
seed 

Wisconsin at noon Friday.

“It’s definitely a big confidence 

boost,” Albrecht said. “We came 
out and played extremely well 
today, especially the younger 
guys, so I think they’ll have a lot of 
confidence going into tomorrow’s 
game.”

Michigan finished with four 

scorers 
in 
double 
figures 
— 

freshman guard Dawkins (18), 
Abdur-Rahkman (15), Irvin (14) 
and senior forward Max Bielfeldt 
(10) — and shot 49 percent from 
the floor.

Irvin opened the second half 

with a turnaround jumper from 
the free-throw line. A moment 
later, Abdur-Rahkman drove at 
Egwu again, absorbed the contact 
and laid it in. The rout was on.

As 
the 
second 
half 
went 

on, Illinois turned up its full-
court pressure, but Michigan 
had no trouble breaking it. The 
Wolverines finished with just 
nine turnovers, never giving the 
Illini chances to make up the 
deficit quickly. Their undersized 
big men outhustled Egwu on the 
glass, and their perimeter defense 
limited 
the 
Illini to a 

season-low 
shooting 
percentage 
from 
long 

range (1-for-
13).

“(Egwu is) a 

long, athletic guy, 
and on our inbounds 
plays 
we 
worked 

on spacing, cutting 
and 
all 
that 
stuff, 

and keeping him off 
the 
offensive 
glass,” 

Bielfeldt said. “I think we 
did a really nice job with 
just 
team 

rebounding 
and getting 
everybody 
out 
of 

there.”

Their 
crisp 

passing dissected 
the 
press 
and 

led to fast-break 
opportunities 
— 

Michigan refused to 
slow down, bring the 
ball back out and milk 
the clock.

The 
Wolverines’ 

aggressive, energetic 
play 
from 
wire 

to 
wire 
sent 
a 

statement 
from 
a 

team that came into 
the 
weekend 
as 

sizable underdogs.

“We’re 
going 

to 
try 
and 

step 
up 
and 

keep 
getting 

better,” 
Dawkins 
said. 
“We’re 
not going 
to let a 
couple 
setbacks 
hold 
us 
back. 

We’re going 
to try and 
get better, no 
matter 
what 

the 
situation 

is.”

CHICAGO — Before Thursday’s 

game against Illinois, Michigan 
assistant coach Bacari Alexander 
wanted the Wolverines to be 
loose, but also to remember what 
happened the last time the two 
teams played — a heartbreaking 
64-52 overtime loss for Michigan.

“I 
gave the guys an acronym 

to 
kind 
of 

concentrate 

on 
today,” 

Alexander 
said. “And 
it 
was 

‘payback.’ 

Each 

letter 
meant 

something.”
While 

Alexander 
wouldn’t 

admit what each letter 

stood for, he was adamant 

in addressing what the game 

represented.

“Everybody’s 0-0,” Alexander 

said. “(It’s the time of the year) 
where you want to preach new life. 
But the reality is they do have new 
life. The confidence you can have 
from that conversation you saw 
today.

For the Wolverines, there’s 

nothing to lose. To have any 
chance at a NCAA Tournament 
bid, they’ll have to win the Big Ten 
Tournament. Even to make the 
NIT, they’ll need at least two wins.

Thursday 
afternoon, 
the 

Wolverines faced a team in a 
different situation. Everything was 

riding on the game for Illinois. 

Being a bubble team for 

the Big Dance, the 
Illini needed to win. 
A loss would send 
them to the NIT.

Aside from a 

10-0 run early in 
the first half by 

Illinois, that new life was evident. 
With Michigan’s starting five 
combining for 65 points, including 
18 by freshman forward Aubrey 
Dawkins and 15 by freshman guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman, 
the Wolverines looked like a new 
team, playing their best basketball 
of the season in the 73-55 victory.

Michigan 
looked 
relaxed. 

Throwing 
alley-oops, 
shooting 

uncontested 3-pointers due to 
great ball movement and even 
dishing over-the-shoulder, no-look 
passes, the Wolverines resembled a 
team finally finding its chemistry.

With so many freshmen coming 

into this year’s team, there was 
no doubt there would be an 
adjustment 
period. 
And 
with 

injuries to junior guard Caris 
LeVert and sophomore guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., that period had 
to be accelerated.

“They’re not worried about 

making mistakes, looking over 
their shoulder for someone coming 
in for them if they don’t make 
a shot or turning the ball over,” 
Albrecht said. “I tell them all the 
time: ‘Just go out there and play. 
Have fun. Who is else is going to 
play? You guys are going to play. 
Don’t worry about it.’

“There’s absolutely no pressure 

on us. … We’re playing just to have 
fun. If we continue to win games, 
anything could happen. There’s 
no pressure on us because no one’s 
expecting us to do any damage in 
this tournament.”

While Alexander wanted the 

Wolverines to remember its past 
games Thursday, he knows being 
able to separate the season into 
different pieces helps too.

“What we try to do is break 

the season down into segments: 
you’ve got the preseason, the regu-
lar season, the conference season 
and 
postseason,” 
he said. “And 
for our guys, 
when you can 

compartmen-

talize the season 

like that, it’s not so 

overwhelming.”
Though the pregame 

message 
will 
carry 
a 

similar message for Friday’s 
rematch against Wisconsin, 
another team that beat 
Michigan in overtime this 
season, Alexander knows 
he’ll need a new creative 
method to express it.

What that’ll be, though, 

is still to be determined.

“I never divulge that 

stuff early,” he said.
