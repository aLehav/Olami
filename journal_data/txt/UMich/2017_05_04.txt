Fellows consist of 
12 U.S. and seven 

International 
journalists

Daily News Editor

The University of Michigan has 

announced its 44th class of Knight-
Wallace Journalism Fellows. The 
new group consists of 12 U.S. and 
seven international journalists.

Fellows spend a year living in the 

University’s Wallace House, where 
they participate in collaborative 
seminars and workshops, while 
simultaneously 
working 
on 

individual courses of study. The 
group engages with scholars from 
all fields, as well as visiting other 
journalists and creative minds.

The Wallace House is a gift from 

the late Mike Wallace, best known 
for his work on the CBS program 
“60 Minutes,” and his wife Mary 
Wallace. Fellows receive a stipend 

of $70,000 for the academic year, 
and the entire program is funded 
by news organizations, foundations 
and individuals such as Jeff Fager, 
the executive producer of 60 
Minutes, dedicated to improving 
journalistic quality.

Wallace House Director Lynette 

Clemetson, 
a 
former 
Knight-

Wallace Fellow, explained how the 
Fellows contribute to the overall 
richness of the University through 
their facilitation of ideas and 
engagement with various faculty 
members.

“When the Fellows come here, 

they’re really participating in the 
University life for a year,” she said. 
“The ability to have mid-career 
journalists in classes bringing their 
work experiences, their travel 
experiences, their life experiences 
into the courses they’re taking at the 
University — we hear from students 
and professors all the time that they 
add such richness to discussions 
and interactions in the class.”

Over the past year, Fellows have 

participated in a wide spectrum 
of University events, most notably 

in a series of panels on subjects 
ranging from how to maintain 
privacy in investigative journalism, 
to reporting during the era of the 
Trump administration.

One of the new Fellows, Jennifer 

Guerra, a Senior Reporter for 
Michigan Radio, said she recently 
completed a project called State of 
Opportunity that examined how 
kids from low-income families 
can be successful in areas such as 
networking and education.

“As one of the two main 

reporters on the project, I filed 
weekly radio stories on everything 
from infant health to foster care to 
first generation college students, 
and twice a year produced hour-
long documentaries on topics such 
as networking, education and race,” 
she said.

Guerra 
emphasized 
how 

excited she is to join the next class 
of Fellows, and use her role as a 
journalist to connect communities 
across the nation and advance civil 
discourse.

“I have been locked in on the

UM3Detroit aims to 
unite all University 

campuses with Detroit 

By EDUARDO BATISTA 

Daily Staff Reporter

On Wednesday, the Ross School 

of Business hosted the um3detroit 
conference, a series of events that 
brought together faculty, researchers 
and several local leaders in a packed 
auditorium to discuss social issues 
impacting the city of Detroit.

The event featured well-known 

local leaders such as Daniel Little, 
chancellor of the University of 
Michigan 
– 
Dearborn, 
Detroit 

Mayor Mike Duggan and Stephen 
Henderson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
opened 
the 
event 
by 

explaining the purpose of the event 
was to bring together the wide array 
of organizations and community 
members doing research and work 
focused in Detroit.

“Well, I have come to realize that 

a very large number of Michigan 
faculty and many students are doing 
projects — engaged research, service 
projects, 
fundamental 
research 

— trying to both understand the 
challenges that are facing Detroit and 
help, to actually make a difference,” 
he said. “I wanted to get together 
the breadth of our community doing 
Detroit-focused research to talk 
to one another, to tell each other 
what we are doing, to try to provoke 
collaborations, to give the community 
a sense of the breadth and scale 
in the ways we are engaging with 
Michigan’s most important city.”

Michigan senator 
introduces bill for 
campus free speech

The bill would require 
campuses to allow all 
invited speakers to 

express ideas

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

Two pieces of legislation — aimed 

at ensuring intellectual debate and 
free speech are allowed on college 
campuses — were introduced in the 
Michigan legislature by state Sen. 
Patrick Colbeck (R – Canton) on 
Tuesday.

If implemented, Senate Bills 349 

and 350 would require colleges and 
universities to adopt policies that 
would allow any speaker invited to 
campus and practicing legal speech 
to participate in a debate, lecture or 
forum.

Illegal speech such as defamation, 

sexual harassment and threats of 
violence would continue to be barred.

In 
a 
press 
release, 
Colbeck 

explained barring free speech does 
not depend on whether or not others 
believe it to be objectionable. He also 
noted the importance of preventing 
the beliefs of students on campus 
from impacting their logical decision-
making, a social psychology term 
called “groupthink.”

“Constitutional 
experts 
agree 

that the litmus test for when free 
speech should be barred has little to 
do with whether others believe it is 
objectionable,” he said. “...We do not 
need a First Amendment to protect 
against the speech we agree with. 
Groupthink is the last thing we want 
to see on our campuses.”

In University of Michigan’s official 

position on freedom of speech and 
expression, E. Royster Harper, the 
University’s vice president for student 
life, said opposing viewpoints have 
the right to be voiced and diverse 
opinions are valued.

“The University of Michigan 

strives to create an environment 
in which diverse opinions can be 
expressed and heard,” Harper said. 

“It is a fundamental value of our 
University that all members of the 
community and their invited guests 
have a right to express their views 
and opinions, regardless of whether 
others may disagree with those 
expressions.”

Furthermore, Colbeck also said 

he believes peaceful spontaneous 
assembly is an integral part of 
the First Amendment and SB 350 
outlines continued protection for 
peaceful protest within the limits of 
the First Amendment.

“Students 
and 
faculty 
are 

permitted to assemble and engage in 
spontaneous expressive activity as 
long as the activity is not unlawful and 
does not materially and substantially 
disrupt the functioning of the 
University, as the First Amendment 
permits,” Senate Bill 350 states.

Colbeck 
also 
said 
protesters 

attempting to interrupt free speech 
with violence should be policed for 
barring the First Amendment. 

“If campus leaders believe some 

speech creates a safety concern 
because of unruly audience members 
wishing to use violence, they must 
police those who would break the law 
in order to stifle free speech, and not 
punish speakers by taking away their 
voice,” Colbeck said. “Intellectual 
freedom on our campuses must not 
be bullied into silence.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Lauren 

Schandevel, 
Communications 

Director 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats and 
a columnist for the Daily, said in an 
email interview she takes issue with 
Colbeck’s legislation because she sees 
it as an attempt to silence protesters.

“Senator Colbeck claims his bill 

promotes and protects free speech, 
but he advocates for disciplinary 
sanctions against students and faculty 
who participate in ‘violent, abusive, 
indecent, 
profane, 
boisterous, 

obscene, unreasonably loud or other 
disorderly conduct’ in response to 
campus speakers,” Schandevel said. 
“That sounds a lot like a thinly-veiled 

attempt to silence protesters, who 
also happen to be protected under the 
First Amendment.”

In a February interview, LSA 

junior Andrew Krieger, president 
of the University’s chapter of Young 
Americans for Liberty, said he 
believes the University plays an 
important role in maintaining free 
speech, but his peers could work on 
being open to the ideas of others.

“So we believe that free speech 

allows for you to challenge your ideas 
and to change the ideas of others,” 
Krieger said. “As far the University 
censoring those ideologies, I think 
that makes racism worse in that 
it solidifies their convictions and 
doesn’t allow for them to hear the 
other side.”

Recently, violent protests on the 

campus of University of California, 
Berkeley were staged in response 
to a planned talk from conservative 
commentator Ann Coulter, and the 
university canceled her appearance. 
Last year, The Michigan Review 
hosted a debate with controversial 
figures Milo Yiannopoulos, who 
recently lost a book deal due to his 
comments on age-of-consent laws, 
and Julie Bindel, who is labled 
as transphobic by many feminist 
advocates. 
With 
both 
banned 

from several schools in the United 
Kingdom, many University students 
took issue with the hosting of the 
event. 

Harper states in the University’s 

official position that protesters have 
the right to oppose the viewpoints 
of others, but not in such a way that 
would limit the speaker’s freedom of 
speech.

“This (freedom of speech) includes 

the right of protesters to oppose 
the expression of views or opinions 
of others, but not in such a way as 
to limit or prevent the speaker or 
performer’s freedom of expression,” 
Harper said.

Colbeck’s office did not respond 

for interviews with the Daily at the 
time of publishing.

Following intense bargaining, 
GEO contract ratified with U

According to the 
GEO website, the 
contract went into 

effect May 1

By MATT HARMON

Daily Staff Reporter

After months of sit-ins, walk-

out speculations and negotiations 
with the University of Michigan, 
the Graduate Employees’ Orga-
nization officially ratified their 
new contract April 15; according 
to the GEO website, the contract 
will go into effectMay 1 and last 
until 2020. Advances in Diver-
sity, Equity and Inclusion for 
Graduate Student Staff Assistant 
positions and protections for 
international Graduate Student 
Instructors, among other chang-
es were included in the final con-
tract.

A sit-in occured at the Michi-

gan Union April 10. Though GEO 
members had voted to authorize 

a walkout the night prior, the 
event was called off when the 
organization announced a ten-
tative agreement was reached 
between the graduate students 
and the University.

According to former GEO 

president John Ware, about 400 
members attended the first meet-
ing after the contract announce-
ment. They then voted to send 
the contract out to all GEO mem-
bers for electronic ratification. 
GEO members — GSIs or GSSAs 
for the winter 2017 semester — 
received the contract and on 
April 15, 72.9 percent of eligible 
voters participated in the vote 
and 98.6 percent of those voted 
yes for ratification.

According to the GEO web-

site, 27 bargaining sessions for 
the contract resulted in approxi-
mately 130 hours at the bargain-
ing table with the University.

New GEO president Rachel 

Miller, who was voted in on Sun-
day, said the bargaining process 
as a whole resulted in a lot of 
wins for the organization.

“(Bargaining) 
was 
incred-

ibly successful from our point of 
view,” she said. “I think it really 
demonstrated how committed 
graduate student workers are to 
solidarity and to supporting each 
other and it really showed we are 
able to get a really good contract 
when we work together.”

In a statement from the Uni-

versity, Melissa Sortman, the 
lead negotiator for the University 
during the bargaining process, 
said the contract brings in all 
three University campuses and is 
a good compromise for everyone 
involved.

“This is a fair contract that 

recognizes the important con-
tributions that GEO members 
make as part of the community 
of scholars on our three campus-
es,” she said. “We will now work 
closely with University Human 
Resources and the schools and 
colleges to implement the terms.”

Two highlights of the contract 

include the creation of six con-
tractually guaranteed GSSA DEI 
positions and an annual $700 co-

pay cap on mental health visits. As 
far as GEO knows, Ware said, these 
contract provisions are the first of 
their kind in the country.

A cap of approximately 20 hours 

per week for international GSIs to 
make sure they don’t violate their 
visas was also included in the con-
tract.

According to the GEO website, 

GEO meetings in the past year 
have resulted in a future focus on 
furthering the strides made in the 
contract pertaining to internation-
al GSIs and DEI initiatives. Miller 
said GEO will use their new con-
tract to push for more protections 
against international discrimina-
tion and more paid positions for 
graduate students doing DEI work.

“This new hours cap is some-

thing that we really have to be 
vigilant about enforcing to make 
sure that international gradu-
ate students aren’t discriminated 
against,” she said. “I think we also 
are very committed to expanding 
the role that graduate students play 
in the implementation and design 
of DEI. The six positions that we 

won are only really the beginning 
of a sort of longer, more-sweeping 
campaign.”

Along with enforcing the hours 

cap, Ware said GEO is going to be 
watching for grievances from grad-
uate students and following up on 
those cases to combat discrimina-
tion.

“We’re going to have a very 

active grievance committee over 
the next year,” he said. “They’re 
going to be working very closely 
with the International Student 
Caucus and they’re going to be very 
vigilant for cases where there may 
be discrimination or unfair shift-
ing of work.”

Miller said another focus of GEO 

will be on the Lecturers Employee 
Organization’s contract bargaining 
discussions next school year. She 
said they will stand by LEO and 
support their efforts.

“LEO … are bargaining a new 

contract this year, so just because 
our contract campaign is over 
doesn’t mean the fight for making 
U of M a more equitable workplace 
ends,” she said.

important, challenging work of 
State of Opportunity for the past five 
years and am incredibly excited to 
join the next class of Knight-Wallace 
Fellows and to focus my energy on 
what’s next,” she said. “We know 
our nation is intensely divided, and I 
believe public media now more than 

ever has a responsibility to cover 
communities in ways that expand 
our understanding of one another. “

A Fellow from Nigeria, Dayo 

Aiyetan, the Executive Director 
of the International Center for 
Investigative Reporting, shared 
on Facebook how excited he is to 
join the program.

“Nothing like waking up to 

such exciting news,” he wrote. 
“Congratulations to all fellows.”

Following Schlissel’s opening 

remarks, several faculty members 
explained 
their 
research 

projects during the “Lightning 
Talks,” 
a 
series 
of 
seven-

minute 
presentations. 
These 

presentations 
covered 
topics 

ranging from air pollution in the 
city and its correlation to poverty 
levels in the city’s neighborhoods, 
to studies of Detroit’s post-crisis 
housing markets.

William 
Collins, 
Executive 

Director 
of 
the 
Center 
for 

Educational Outreach, discussed 
the breadth of research being 
done at the University, and how it 
contributes to innovation.

“We are a very large University, 

very dynamic in innovation, very 
decentralized University, so it is 

very easy for a lot programs to be 
created, developed and authored, 
but not easy to know about them,” 
Collins said. “So the opportunity 
to learn about the extent of these 
programs and activities, to share 
information 
about 
them, 
to 

collaborate, meet people, these 
are the types of things that are 
valued in events like this.”

Additionally, 
speakers 
also 

emphasized the shared efforts 
between the University’s three 
campuses and the city. This 
theme was furthered by flyers 
which stated “three campuses 
researching and learning in and 
with Detroit.”

OPINION

A

day or two after Spring 
Break this year, as I sat 
studying in the Java Blu 

cafe in East Quad, I heard a girl 
say: “Well it isn’t Spring Break if 
someone doesn’t throw up.” She 
was referring to something her 
friend had said about someone 
on a Spring Break trip who’d 
vomited after drinking too much 
alcohol. Immediately, the casual 
way she responded struck me as 
odd. The way they both agreed 
with her statement and laughed. 
The normalcy with which they 
treated this. Unfortunately, it 
makes sense; this is nothing new, 
nothing unheard of — to drink 
with the intent of getting drunk 
and maybe getting sick. But sitting 
there, digesting what I’d heard, it 
really hit me how problematic this 
exchange was. 

 I’m not here to shame anyone for 

drinking. Rather, it is the narrative 
about drinking that must change. 
Too 
often 
individuals 
don’t 

contemplate how what we say — 
that it’s OK, even normal, to drink 
in excess — will affect others. 
What’s more, television shows, 
movies, books and more, also help 
create a culture around drinking 
that sends the wrong message. 
They often reaffirm statements 
like the one I overheard in Java 
Blu and even validate them. 
More importantly, they also 
precipitate them. 

Though I didn’t used to admit 

it, one of my favorite shows 
was Gossip Girl. (I still rewatch 

random episodes every once in 
awhile, but shhh, that’s a secret.) 
While I wouldn’t consider the 
show fine art by any means, 
I’m still a sucker for almost any 
show with a lot of drama. I was 
also fascinated by the glamorous 
aesthetic of Gossip Girl: the ball 
gowns, the themed parties, the 
sleepovers with French pastries 
and expensive art. But the one 
thing that always struck me 
was the abundance of alcohol in 
each episode, and all the times 
the 
characters 
would 
pop 

champagne in the back of a 
limo or drink at weddings until 
they found themselves too drunk 
to stand. 

Gossip Girl isn’t the only 

show that glamorizes teenagers 
drinking. 
Shows 
like 
Friday 

Night Lights and Pretty Little 
Liars do similar things. And in 
each show, while they do portray 
some consequences, it’s only to 
make the show more dramatic 
until there’s something else 
going on, and are not issues that 
are almost never fully addressed, 
made light of even.

 When America’s most well-

known 
television 
and 
movie 

characters are downing drink 
after drink, it encourages an 
already significant problem of 
binge drinking. Binge drinking 
is especially alarming on college 
campuses, where rates of binge 
drinking are much higher in 
comparison 
to 
non-college 

settings. While some articles, 

such as one in the New York 
Times, pinpoint the heightened 
problems on lax enforcement of 
laws and easy access to alcohol, 
what gets students there is a 
society that is full of messages 
OK-ing it. Though these issues of 
law enforcement and access may 
help fuel the problem, without 
real changes in the way we talk 
about and disseminate images 
of drinking and party culture, 
tougher policing and more limited 
access to alcohol won’t do much. 
Even the Times piece cites that 
many students already have access 
to and have used substances 
before coming to college — so it 
is not college in and of itself that 
creates this problem. 

This must be addressed, as 

drinking is a significant part of 
American society and can pose 
risks if it’s done in excess. For 
instance, 26.9 percent of people 
18 and older reported binge 
drinking in the past month. Since 
the legal drinking age is 21 in the 
United States, it is likely there are 
people who are not reporting their 
alcohol consumption truthfully, 
though the surveys were likely 
anonymous. Drinking has also 
been linked to creating various 
health problems, such as damage 
to one’s liver, an organ that is 
crucial to aid digestion and get 
important nutrients in your body. 
It can also, in some cases, affect 
one’s brain and has been linked 
to problems controlling diabetes. 
Arguably even more alarming,

the University of Michigan since 1890.

Change the narrative

is that around 88,000 people die 
from 
“alcohol-related 
causes” 

each year. 

And while the health risks 

associated with excessive drinking 
are more apparent, binge drinking 
does have other consequences. 
In 2010, binge drinking cost the 
United States $191 billion, which 
included “losses in productivity,” 
highlighting how it affects one’s 
day-to-day functions and how 
they can affect people in ways of 
which we may not even be aware. 

I know drinking will stay a part 

of our culture for a long time, 
seep into movies, television and 
songs, and I am not saying that 
the solution is to outlaw drinking. 
But if scholars, health officials 
and people nationwide want to 
combat increasing rates of binge 
drinking on college campuses 
and other unhealthy alcohol-
related habits, they need to take a 
good long look at the media. 

And for those who publish 

books, create our shows, produce 
our songs, they must think 
about the messages they are 
sending. The narrative so widely 
disseminated 
that 
glamorizes 

drugs and alcohol consumption 
or makes fun of two drunk 
people making out, must change 

to reflect realistic effects of 
drinking in this nature. If not, 
these mediums, with so much 
power, play a significant role 
in preserving a culture that 
promotes, and even encourages, 
dangerous 
drug 
and 
alcohol 

use. Getting powerful actors to 
step up is vitally important to 
help effectively change the way 
individuals talk about drinking. 

Yet, 
while 
it 
is 
nearly 

impossible for individuals to 
force larger changes in the way 
the 
media 
portrays 
drinking 

and party culture, we can still 
all do something to change 
the 
narrative. 
On 
a 
more 

individual level, it is important 
to think about how we have talk 
about drinking. As long as we 
normalize excessive drinking, 
pass it off as a “typical” Spring 
Break when someone pukes from 
alcohol poisoning, or post that 
picture making fun of the fact 
we don’t remember what they did 
after a night of drinking, we will 
continue to perpetuate this larger 
problem.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

N

owadays, I feel that we 
are out of touch with true 
kindness. Kindness is seen 

almost exclusively on phone screens 
through social media, where selfless 
people feed the homeless and leave 
extra-large cash tips at restaurants, 
where 
abandoned 
puppies 
are 

adopted by strangers and giant teddy 
bears distribute roses on the streets.

Kindness is no more than a brief 

tinge of inspiration before we scroll 
down to the next meme, the next 
corgi video and the next inspirational 
clip to which we tell ourselves, “next 
time.” Guilty as any other, I decide 
that the people in the videos are 
who I strive to be — but when I pass 
a homeless person on State Street, 
when I am prompted to “donate 
to ___ Charity (any amount will 
do!),” I think about what an extra 
dollar can buy me with my college 
Amazon Prime and, begrudgingly, 
decide again:

“Next time.”
Next time, I will put a stranger’s 

needs before mine. Next time, I 
will be rich enough, brave enough 
to make a sacrifice. Next time, I 
will be kind.

It has become a major trend in 

our generation, but it’s not that 
we don’t have good intentions. 
And it’s certainly not that we don’t 
care. Nevertheless, our routine 
hesitation to show kindness never 
speaks as loud as to those who are 
searching for it.

Without realizing it at first, 

searching for kindness is exactly 
what I set out to do. While I’d 
developed a certain distaste for 
those using the internet to boast 
acts of kindness, I had no problem 
using social media to promote 
it. Last semester, I had recently 
decided to become more involved 
in a student organization of 
mine, the Pre-Pharmacy Student 
Organization. 
Seeing 
that 
it 

was Relay for Life fundraising 
season, I took on the role of the 
“shameless advertiser”: sharing 
events 
on 
Facebook, 
posting 

updates on my Snapchat story and 
nagging virtually every human 

soul I encountered to come to our 
Chipotle fundraising event today 
from 4-8 p.m.! And what shame 
did I have, publicizing a nationally 
proclaimed fundraiser for cancer 
research? I truly wanted to make 
a difference — to my club, to the 
cancer patients, to anyone I could, 
really — but it was the usual lack of 
cooperation that met my newfound 
bout of benevolence.

The day of the fundraiser, there 

were the PPSO members who 
attended because they had to, 
and the few friends who attended 
because I told them to — earning 
from me a high-pitched “OMG 
thank you!” Mostly, there were 
the “next times”: the ones who 
didn’t have time that day, the ones 
who have already spent too much 
money on food that week and the 
ones who accepted my Diag flyers 
as simple courtesy — if at all. And 
I couldn’t blame them, because I 
too am busy, poor and experienced 
in the art of flyer evasion. I 
asked myself if I would be going 
to Chipotle that night if it was 
another organization holding the 
fundraiser, even though I already 
knew that the answer was no.

Hence, it was not in particularly 

high hopes that I announced the 
fundraiser to my evening medical 
ethics seminar. I expected my 
announcement to affect one or 
two listeners at best, and it was no 
secret that my classmates, feigning 
interest, expected the same. Thus, 
it did not occur to us that when 
our professor decided to “end 
class 10-15 minutes early to get 
burritos — on [him]!” that he was 
not even a little bit joking. As he 
addressed our dropped jaws with a 
smile, I cautiously asked if he was 
sarcastic, to which he replied, “of 
course not, it’s a great cause!”

And a great cause it was – to the 

class, to PPSO, to the Relay for Life 
foundation, but to me, especially. 
As dramatic as it sounds, I had 
been splashed with cold cynicism 
throughout 
my 
long 
day 
of 

minimally successful advertising, 
such that I began questioning 

why I was still pushing for the 
fundraiser at all. Was it truly out 
of desperation to help others, or 
simply out of obligation? Or was it 
just to look more passionate, more 
involved?

Our 
professor 
didn’t 
want 

to look like anything. Rather, 
he wanted purely to donate to 
charity, sending the whole class 
to Chipotle with $200 in cash and 
wishing us the sincerest “enjoy!” 
before rushing home to spend time 
with his kids. As we walked out of 
Mason Hall into the cold Michigan 
evening, a classmate noted he was 
not wearing a coat. In fact, he 
had given his jacket to a medical 
resident at work, refusing to let her 
out in the cold without her own. It 
was not the first time he absolutely 
inspired us.

Needless to say, my Chipotle 

bowl tasted especially good that 
day. There is something about 
the immediate presence of sheer 
kindness that punctuates a moment 
so easily mistaken for mundane. I 
felt more touched than I had been 
in a while — for the first time, I did 
not have to beg, persuade or offer 
any reward for someone to do so 
naturally what most would not. It 
was a much-needed reminder that 
not every modern act of kindness 
is of the “staged, filmed and posted 
online” variety, and that the most 
commendable of actions are free 
of credits, likes and a tirade of 
negative comments.

A few months later, I can’t 

say that I now drop $200 on 
fundraisers or lend my belongings 
without question, but hey — I’ve 
developed a new appreciation for all 
the good causes to explore on this 
diverse campus, as well as the pesky 
Diag flyers that promote them.

While I can’t say how many more 

“next times” are down the road, I 
invite us to ask ourselves: if we don’t 
inspire each other, who will?

One of a kind
Telling your friends they don’t matter
I

t was about 2:50 p.m. on a Tuesday 
in one of the larger lecture halls 
at Michigan State University. 

Class had been going on for nearly an 
hour, but my two friends and I sitting 
in the back of the room had basically 
checked out. While lazily scrolling 
through Twitter on my Mac, I was 
daydreaming about my upcoming 
weekend plans — I had a few parties 
to go to, some friends I wanted to see, 
and my roommate and I had to figure 
out how to, again, haphazardly sneak 
nearly sixty beers into our dorm 
room. 

And suddenly, an email popped 

onto my screen. In all caps it 
screamed, “CONGRATULATIONS 
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED 
TO...”, and without even having to 
open it, I knew exactly what it was. 
Screaming silently to myself I realized 
that I was going to transfer to my 
dream school, one the most prestigious 
and elite public schools in the world, 
the University of Michigan.

I excitingly showed off the email 

to my two friends. They had known 
how badly I wanted to be part of the 
University of Michigan, yet almost 
instantly, their dismissive sighs and 
shaking heads highlighted a trend 
I should’ve recognized. I selfishly 
ignored them, and switched from 
daydreaming about my weekend to 
imagining what was a pure fantasy 
about how amazing my life would be at 
the University of Michigan.

I imagined that now, after having to 

spend my freshman year at my “safe” 
school of Michigan State — I was finally 
going to join the most elite students of 
University of Michigan where my 
“actual” college life would begin.

But unfortunately that life, whether 

or not I wanted to accept it, already 
had begun at MSU. That year I spent 
there was not dominated by self-pity 
and jealousy toward University of 
Michigan. Instead, I experienced an 
incredible freshman year of college 
life, going on date parties, attending 
football tailgates, playing volleyball and 
spending entire nights with friends 
cramming for exams. I had every 
cliché college experience at MSU and I 
enjoyed nearly every second.

And this life I had created was 

a massive investment; I had spent 
considerable 
time 
and 
energy 

understanding 
my 
identity 
and 

building a group of friends. I had 
become a permanent student at MSU 
— I knew every road, building, frat 
house and bar in the city, I had friends 
scattered across campus that would 
see me anytime and my wardrobe was 
adorned in MSU’s green and white that 
I always looked forward to wearing 

with a subtle pride.

Yet 
somehow, 
I 
allowed 
my 

pessimistic ego to get the better of 
me. My unending desire to be part 
of the elite crowd at the University 
of Michigan fueled a disastrous 
perspective that was able to blind me 
from all the positives in my life at MSU. 
I allowed my selfish thoughts to make 
me believe I had lost my potential 
and had been trapped in permanent 
mediocrity at the “little brother” school 
to the University of Michigan.

So when that transfer acceptance 

arrived, I was overwhelmed with this 
selfish joy that satisfied the jealousy I 
had toward students at the University 
of Michigan. I felt “happy,” excited, 
and finally felt as if I had accomplished 
something. I wish I had known that 
those feelings were only temporary. 
Because not only do those feelings not 
last, but the expectations I had built in 
my imagination about the University of 
Michigan could never be met.

And more importantly, I was 

throwing away everything I had 
built on MSU’s campus, and was 
basically telling my friends that they 
did not matter in this decision. That 
the campus, the school, the football 
tailgates, the late nights laughing 
and stumbling around the city, none 
of that was good enough for me. 
That underneath all of the fun and 
amazing times, I was unhappy and 
unsatisfied with all of them. And 
my transfer acceptance reaffirmed 
all of that. I was leaving, I thought 
I was better, and it looked as if they 
didn’t matter — that I thought I would 
make new, smarter, wealthier, well-
connected friends at the University of 
Michigan.

Yet my friends seem to know 

something I didn’t, that the University 
of Michigan wouldn’t make me 
“happy,” 
that 
a 
school 
doesn’t 

automatically change your life for the 
better. Sometimes you have to make 
a decision for your future, sometimes 
you sacrifice things you think you love 
in the hope that later on, some greater 
return will come. But sometimes, these 
decisions are clouded from jealousy 
and selfishness.

Transferring to the University of 

Michigan changed my entire college 
experience; I left behind a life I could’ve 
embraced at MSU and often think 
about what could’ve been if I had just 
stayed. My friends were right though, 
a school doesn’t make you happy — it’s 
what you make of it.

‘Circle’ tanks

By BECKY PORTMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Directed 
by 
James 
Ponsoldt 

(“The Spectacular Now”) and star-
ring big-time actors like Emma 
Watson (“Beauty and the Beast”), 
Tom Hanks (“Bridge of Spies”) and 
strangely Patton Oswalt (“Ratatouil-
le”) in a suit, “The Circle” is a film 
wrought with wasted potential. The 
concept is strong — it points out the 
omnipresence of social media and 
the internet within our society — but 
the execution is weak and disap-
pointing.

The film is based on Dave Egg-

ers’s (“A Hologram for the King”) 
2013 novel of the same name which 
centers on the young Mae Holland 
(Watson) who begins working at a 
giant tech company rivaling Face-
book and Google, The Circle. The 
Circle is a millennial’s paradise, filled 
with Doga (Dog Yoga), juice bars 
and Beck (yes, Beck performs in the 
film, and it might be the best part). 
The Circle is led by the charismatic, 
tea-drinking, jeans-wearing Eamon 

Bailey 
(Hanks), 

who comes across 
as more of a moti-
vational 
speaker 

than a Mussolini. 
At the film’s start, 
Mae seems hesitant 

and critical of the company’s strategy 
and philosophy, yet she decides to 
go completely “transparent” (docu-
menting every moment of her life on 
camera), giving in to their twisted 
ideas on privacy. Mae’s ambivalence 
is never addressed or even reconciled 
in the film. She flip-flops from uncer-
tainty to full on reality star in a mat-
ter of minutes, leaving her character 
development muddy and unclear.

Additionally, the relationships 

throughout the film are left unestab-
lished. Annie (“Doctor Who”’s 
Karen Gillan) gets Mae the job, yet 
the viewer knows little to nothing 
about their past and their friend-
ship. John Boyega (“Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”) as Ty Laffite is on 

screen for about two minutes and 
somehow is defined as Mae’s love 
interest, yet he spends most of his 
limited time using his phone. Ellar 
Coltrane (“Boyhood”) plays Mercer, 
Mae’s childhood friend, who is dis-
turbed by Mae’s ever-present internet 
presence. However, yet again their 
relationship is undefined and when 
tragedy strikes, grief and responsibil-
ity are overtaken by poor decisions 
and an unresolved plot.

In 110 minutes, “The Circle” acts 

like an extended episode of “Black 
Mirror,” only that “Black Mirror” 
does technology gone awry and social 
media dominance better and quicker. 
The film spends more time on Mae’s 
social media presence, crowding the 
screen with “zings” (the equivalent of 
tweets in The Circle universe), rather 
than resolving the film’s central con-
flict. While the film tries to highlight 
our society’s dependence on the 
internet and a dwindling sense of 
privacy, it ends with the world in a 
worse place than where it started. 
Mae might be the film’s villain or a 
failure at the heroine; either way her 
motives and actions are unidentifi-
able, leaving the audience confused 
and unsatisfied.

“The Circle” is only remedied by 

the few humorous scenes that turn 
this unthrilling thriller into a creepy, 
cult-like film straight out of an epi-
sode of “Portlandia.” Every member 
of The Circle is a little too excited to 
be there, yet that groupthink, robot-
like, screen-obsessed mentality is 
too often neglected for an extrane-
ous scene of Mae kayaking.

Overall, “The Circle” is a disap-

pointing and underwhelming criti-
cism of our society’s obsession with 
constant connectivity. The film 
tries to dismantle the hierarchy of 
privacy, yet its idea of conflict reso-
lution just furthers the issues it 
brings to the surface. “The Circle” 
begins as a hopeful, pastel-colored 
infomercial for Silicon Valley’s 
millennial Disneyland but quickly 
turns into a poorly developed, shal-
low and overall transparent film.

Dan Chaon discusses 
tragedy in new novel 

By LAURA DZUBAY

Daily Arts Writer

 The book’s inherent darkness 
is obvious from its very title, 
“Ill Will,” as well as from its 
introductory passage about the 
body of a young man sinking to 
the bottom of a river. But as one 
keeps reading, more and more 
new angles crop up in the story, 
each one propelling the narra-
tive even deeper into darkness 
than the one before it.
 “Ill Will” tells the story of 
Dustin Tillman, a suburban psy-
chologist whose parents, aunt 
and uncle were all violently 
murdered 30 years ago — sup-
posedly by his adopted brother 
Rusty, against whom Dustin 
testified using accusations of 
satanic ritual abuse. Now, DNA 
evidence has proved Rusty’s 
innocence, and Dustin has to 
process the news of his release 
from prison. All the while, 
Dustin’s wife is dying of cancer, 
his son is spiraling deeper into a 
heroin addiction and one of his 
patients is convinced that the 
periodical drownings of drunk 
college boys in the area are, in 
fact, serial killings.
 “I think it has to do with 
trauma begetting other trau-
mas,” said novel’s author, Dan 
Chaon, in an interview. “With 
Dustin, you have this very trau-
matic experience as a kid that 
he hadn’t really dealt with in 
any substantive way. So he kind 
of built his life around ignor-
ing that trauma. [...] He was in 
a sort of happy suburban life, 
everything was fine, but once 
one domino fell, everything 
became much harder for him 
to deal with because he hadn’t 
dealt with the original trauma.”
In the case of “Ill Will,” the 
trauma so inherent to the story 
— the underlying sense of harm, 
of dread and indeed of ill will — 
is oriented not only around spe-
cific events, but around specific 
people as well. There is Dustin, 
the unlucky protagonist turned 
unreliable narrator; Aaron, the 
heroin-addicted teenager who 
makes out with his best friend’s 
dying mom, only to have his best 

friend go missing and turn up 
dead soon afterward; Kate and 
Wave, the twin sisters whose 
divergent beliefs during Rusty’s 
murder trial set them apart 
for the rest of their lives. With 
the exception of Dustin’s wife, 
every major character has at 
least one section in the book that 
is focused entirely on their per-
spective. According to Chaon, 
these sections were all planned 
out beforehand. The book does 
a masterful job of using them to 
fill-in a more complete picture 
of the events and the charac-
ters’ motivations, one fragment 
at a time.
 The sections fluctuate a little 
between first person and third 
person, as well as past tense and 
present, and this is only one of 
the ways in which Chaon uses 
the story to experiment. The 
visual presentation of the prose 
itself is innovative: The lines 
and paragraphs are sometimes 
broken up in terms of spacing, 
and twice in the book the pages 
are boxed in and divided into 
columns that follow multiple 
narratives at a 
time.
 “I think that 
maybe the origi-
nal 
impetus 

just came from 
being jealous of 
poetry, and lik-
ing 
the 
things 

that you can do 
with poetry on 
the page,” Chaon 
said. “With this 
particular book, it felt like it 
was really vital as a way to 
describe the level of dissocia-
tion in the characters’ lives, and 
particularly in Dustin’s life. It 
seemed like it wasn’t just a gim-
mick, but it actually sort of felt 
intrinsic to the reader being 
able to understand how Dustin 
thought.”
 Chaon does a lot of his writ-
ing longhand, which he said 
had a tremendous impact on the 
evolution of the book in terms of 
the exploratory structure, the 
inventive uses of form and the 
revisions that took each section 
through multiple drafts. His 
opinions of the characters also 

changed as he was writing the 
book, particularly in the case of 
Rusty.
 “When I started out, I thought 
of him primarily as a horrible 
bully who had been an awful 
influence on Dustin. Then as I 
went along and sort of thought 
about his own background and 
what had happened to him, I 
found myself becoming more 
— sympathetic is a weird word, 
but empathetic,” Chaon said. “I 
started to feel more compassion 
for him. And that was weird, 
because in the first half of the 
book he is kind of the bad guy.”
One of the things that “Ill Will” 
does so well is indeed chang-
ing the way it presents its char-
acters. By the end of the book, 
almost every character seemed 
significantly — at times even 
fundamentally — different from 
how they had seemed at the 
beginning. What makes this 
interesting is the fact that rarely 
are the earlier representations 
of the characters disproved or 
recanted; the change in their 
presentations comes more from 

new experiences 
of theirs being 
revealed, 
and 

new 
layers 
of 

these experienc-
es being uncov-
ered.
“Ill 
Will” 
is 

disturbing 
and 

unfriendly, 
but it is also a 
nearly 
impos-

sible book to put 

down. Against twin backdrops 
of Nebraska and the “haunting,” 
“post-industrial 
landscape” 

of Cleveland, Chaon leads the 
reader through a dark labyrinth 
of human horrors that comes 
closer to emotional truth than 
many of us may want to admit. 
The book is a long series of trau-
mas and tragically flawed rela-
tionships, and Chaon doesn’t 
grant any of his characters a 
happy ending, but through his 
detailed, sensitive and at times 
stunning prose, he treats them 
with a level of compassion that 
is the mark of truly quality writ-
ing.

‘Veep’ star talks politics

Matt Walsh 

discusses political 
satire and comedy

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

“That came out wrong,” was 

uttered not by U.S. Press Secre-
tary Sean Spicer, but by “Veep”’s 
Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh) 
after a gaffe that earned him one 
of Selena Meyer’s (Julia Louis-
Dreyfus, “Seinfeld”) famous 
glares. Though the bumbling 
former White House Press Sec-
retary is often compared with 
Spicer, the series refrains from 
commenting directly on its 
uncanny parallels to the current 
administration. In a conference 
call interview with the Daily, 
Walsh explained what makes 
the comedy so salient, while 
discussing his character Mike 
McLintock on the show.

The Emmy Award-winning 

series, lauded for its hilarious 

cast and sharp satirization of 
American politics, has become 
even more of a topic of conversa-
tion in its sixth season following 
the 2016 Presidential Election.

“I think a lot of people are 

more engaged now,” said Walsh 
of viewers. Rather than taking 
a partisan stance, however, the 
show aims to influence people’s 
perception of politics overall.

“I think that comedy can 

be effective in humanizing 
what’s sacred, so hopefully it 
just reminds people that it’s just 
human beings trying to push 
ideals through in a very flawed 
system,” Walsh stated.

According to Walsh, the 

Armando Iannucci (“In the 
Loop”) created series, taken 
over by David Mandel (“Sein-
feld”) in its fifth season, has 
served as a cynical portrait 
of American politics from its 
inception.

“The show has always lived 

and died by its insults,” Walsh 
said of the show’s crassness, “I 
think that was one of Arman-
do’s first observations (of D.C.) 

… and that was one of the things 
he wanted to satirize.”

With the profusion of crude 

insults being hurled around, 
the absence of references to 
presidents beyond Reagan and 
Selena’s undefined party affili-
ation may escape notice. That’s 
what makes the show different 
in Walsh’s opinion.

“It operates on this fiction, 

which I think gives us a lot more 
latitude to comment on the 
greater truths about what’s hap-
pening,” Walsh said.

For Walsh, telling the truth 

through comedy is one of the 
most rewarding parts of being 
on the show and of being a com-
edy actor.

“I love the power of mak-

ing people laugh,” he said. “It’s 
very rewarding to be on the 
stage and write something that 
can get this huge response from 
people.”

Walsh’s 
experience 
with 

comedy started at an early age, 
ultimately leading him to found 
the Upright Citizen’s Brigade 
alongside comedians like Amy 

Poehler (“Parks and Recre-
ation”) and Matt Besser (“The 
UCB Show”).

“I think comedy and improv 

and sketch are about life experi-
ence,” Walsh said of his improv 
experience. “I think ultimately 
you have to develop very keen 
listening habits.”

He fostered those habits as 

a psychology major at North-
ern Illinois University, where 
his training would later on 
help him “identify patterns 
in behavior” that helped him 
develop characters like Mike.

“I feel like I’ve had a hand 

in creating Mike’s evolution 
and creating … the details of his 
backstory and the details of his 
character flaws,” Walsh said.

Mike’s flaws are especially 

visible in his new role as a par-
ent this season.

“I think he feels older, and 

he feels more overwhelmed,” 
Walsh said. “I think in Mike’s 
situation he feels unfulfilled 
just being a dad, because he’s 
not creatively stimulated.”

This season, Mike is faced 

with an unruly child whom he 
adopted from China under the 
impression that she was three 
years younger than she really is, 
in addition to the birth of twin 
babies, all while dealing with his 
recent unemployment. How-
ever, Walsh claimed that yet “of 
all the characters, Mike has the 
happiest life outside work.” 

Walsh related Mike’s arc for 

the season: “I think as always, 
Mike’s main obstacle is work-
ing for a terrible boss — also, 
it’s a tough business (politics) … 
for Mike I think it’s always that 
struggle between personal hap-
piness and professional happi-
ness, and I think that continues 
this season as well.”

As for the show, Walsh 

praised the writers for their 
imagination and fearlessness as 
well.

“What I love about our show 

is they’re willing to rip up the 
premise,” Walsh said in citing 
Selena’s 
unexpected 
ascen-

sion to the presidency then to 
herdevastating loss in the bid 
for reelection following a his-

toric Electoral College tie as an 
example.

Often, scenes in the script 

are revised using improvisation 
during rehearsal — a method 
Walsh claimed helps identify 
what’s not working in the script. 
During filming, Walsh said 
there are few free takes (after 
which the scenes as written 
have completed shooting), but 
that those opportunities provide 
Walsh with the chance to fur-
ther put his improv chops to use.

Additionally, Walsh cred-

its his comedic prowess on the 
show to the exchange between 
castmates.

“I 
think 
most 
comedy 

involves a scene partner, and I 
think that’s where great come-
dians show themselves — is 
their ability to listen and use 
what their partner’s giving 
them,” he said.

“Mike McLintock has been 

one of my favorite roles, and 
it’s such an honor to come back 
as an actor and as a returning 
character,” Walsh added of his 
experience on the show.

Delaney soars

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

It’s remarkable how quickly Ama-

zon’s “Catastrophe” became one of 
the best new comedies of the 2010s. 
Usually, it takes some time for TV 
comedies to attain critical success 
before they find their footing. But 
for some reason, “Catastrophe” — 
which first aired in 2015 on British 
network Channel 4 — has consis-
tently delivered on each of its 18 half-
hour episodes. Co-creators and stars 
Rob Delaney (“Life After Beth”) and 
Sharon Horgan (“Divorce”) have 
taken a wild premise — an American 
man impregnates an Irish woman 
in London after a one-night stand 
— and fleshed it out with an honest, 
unflinching and hysterical look into 
marriage and family dynamics. Now 
in its third season, “Catastrophe” 
unspools the complexity of its protag-
onists and their unconventional rela-
tionship — while remaining hilarious 
as ever.

Unlike Season Two’s time leap, 

season three of “Catastrophe” begins 
right where it left off: The schlubby 
Rob (Delaney) asks about a receipt 
for a Plan B pill from his wife Sharon 

(Horgan), who drunkenly engaged 
in a quasi-affair with a stranger the 
night before. Though the infidel-
ity storyline only lingers for that first 
episode, it leads to an ongoing tension 
between the two hapless lovebirds 
that plays out as both entertaining 
and unnerving.

“We communicate on a wave-

length,” Rob tells his eccentric friend 
Chris (Mark Bonnar, “Undercover”) 
in the second episode. Even with this 
casual aside, the 
pain and lack of 
communication 
between Rob and 
Sharon goes much 
deeper than Sha-
ron’s 
one-night 

fluke. As each episode shows, the 
couple is still grappling with learning 
how to be fully-functioning adults, 
parenthood and marriage being 
the biggest obstacles to attaining 
that ideal. Along with confronting a 
thread of issues like house mortgag-
ing, job hunting and family discon-
nect, Rob and Sharon must come 
to terms with their own personal 
qualms that threaten to destroy their 
already dysfunctional marriage. 

What makes these characters so 

absorbing and different from any 
other TV couple is primarily due to 
the dynamism of Delaney and Hor-
gan’s on and offscreen partnership. 
They write and act out their roles so 
well they could easily pass for being 
a real-life couple, simply replaying 
their everyday experiences for a TV 
audience. Delaney infuses both a boy-
ish smugness and gentle vulnerability 
in Rob, while Horgan paints Sharon 
into a complex, frustrated wife whose 
indecision often conflicts with ambi-
tions of her own. Together, they’re 
comedy gold with a wicked hint of 
gravitas.

Despite a bit of a lull in the middle 

of season three — episodes three 
and four are not the strongest of the 
bunch — almost every moment feels 
like an important contribution to 
“Catastrophe”’s characters and over-
all narrative.

After being fired for a misunder-

standing involving a sexual harass-
ment complaint, Rob’s desire to find 
work is upended by his arrogance and 
day drinking. The arrogance aspect 
makes for some great comedic mate-
rial, as he zig zags his way through 
failed interviews with prospective 
employers. But the drinking aspect 

lands as much more troubling, and 
keeping that bad habit a secret from 
Sharon makes for a disheartening 
reveal in the season finale.

Meanwhile, Sharon struggles to 

make sense of her own self-worth, 
whether it’s being an underappreci-
ated elementary school teacher or an 
undervalued daughter and sister. But 
despite her vulgarity and immaturity, 
Sharon gains some closure with her-
self when dealing with her dementia-
riddled dad Des (Gary Lilburn) and 
childish brother Fergal (Jonathan 
Forbes, “Black Mirror”).

These moments of tenderness and 

melancholy, interspersed with Rob 
and Sharon’s shenanigans, pull hard 
at the heartstrings. It’s difficult to 
incorporate drama in a comedy with-
out making it seem trite, but “Catas-
trophe” tramples those expectations 
with grace. Season three’s unexpected 
cliffhanger is no exception; it’s as jaw-
dropping as it is heart-wrenching.

Despite being more serious than 

the first two seasons, the third season 
of “Catastrophe” still maintains its 
raunchy roots. It welcomes the return 
of Ashley Jensen (“Ugly Betty”) and 
Eileen Walsh (“Pure Mule”) as Sha-
ron’s kooky friends Fran and Kate, 

as well as a brief but amazing guest 
appearance from Domhnall Glee-
son (“Brooklyn”) as Rob’s reluctant 
recruitment consultant. Continuing 
the role of Rob’s mother from previous 
seasons, the late Carrie Fisher (“Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens”) delivers 
one of her greatest final performances, 
imbuing a sinister mix of black humor 
and pathos in her attempt to curb Rob 
from destroying his family with his 
alcoholism. 

With these layers lifted, “Catastro-

phe” gradually sheds from its risqué 
cocoon and blossoms into something 
much more substantial and potent. 
After all, the core of “Catastrophe”’s 
plot is the constant threat of disaster 
and how to handle those kinds of situ-
ations. As messy as Rob and Sharon are 
on their own, they find a way to come 
together even in the darkest of times. 
Their evolution from restless strang-
ers to a married couple is a journey 
that challenges the two to acknowl-
edge their imperfections instead of 
repressing them. But perhaps it’s their 
instinctual ability to achieve peace 
within themselves and one another 
during intense, earth-shattering fights 
that makes them, and “Catastrophe,” 
great to watch.

New grants fund shared sustainability research

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

On Friday, four University of 

Michigan research projects received 
almost $500,000 total in grant money 

from the Graham Sustainability 
Institute— an initiative that supports 
research and education at the 
University under the Office of the 
Provost. All four studies are related to 
sustainability and are funded by the 
Institute’s Emerging Opportunities 
Program, which provides funding for 

University research in sustainability 
and 
promotes 
cross-disciplinary 

collaboration with external partners.

In 
the 
Graham 
Institute’s 

announcement 
of 
the 
awards, 

University President Mark Schlissel 
said the projects are reflective of the 
University’s work in sustainability.

“These 
projects 
reflect 
an 

exceptional range of sustainability 
initiatives being led by U-M faculty 
in partnership with local and global 
partners,” he said. “I’m confident the 
results from these efforts will lead to 
meaningful and lasting impacts.”

The awards consisted of two 

types of grants: Transformation 
and Catalyst. The Transformation 
Grant — the larger of the two — is 
a 
three-year, 
$150,000-per-year 

opportunity. 
According 
to 
an 

informational 
slideshow 
on 
the 

Emerging Opportunities Program, it 
supports collaborative research and 
assessment projects and “projects 
with 
potential 
for 
significantly 

greater impact” than Catalyst Grants. 
Catalyst grants — four to six of which 
are awarded each year — support 
more 
short-term 
collaborative 

projects; studies that receive these 
grants are typically at an earlier stage 
of research.

John Callewaert, the director 

of 
the 
Emerging 
Opportunities 

Program, said the program aims to 
encourage collaboration between 
disciplines — those from the School of 
Public Health, the School of Natural 
Resources and Environment and the 
Urban Planning Program, among 
others.

“We’re trying to leverage the 

breadth and depth of sustainability 
activity at the University,” he said. 
“In the request for proposals we put 
out, we say the team of researchers 
has to reflect at least two U of M 
units — (for example,) someone 
from Engineering and then someone 
from outside of Engineering … The 
reason for that is twofold. One is 
sustainability challenges are not just 
defined to one discipline… The other 
thing is there are few institutions like 
U of M that have the excellence across 
so many disciplines. What we’re 
doing is trying to do what we can to 
leverage that, bring that together and 
encourage it.”

Another element of the research 

projects, according to Callewaert, 
is they incorporate partners from 
outside the University.

Transformation grant
A project entitled “Leveraging 

existing data and insights into the 
policy process to accelerate progress 
toward achieving sustainable diets in 
the global south” received this year’s 
Transformation Grant.

In 
partnership 
with 
the 

International Center for Tropical 
Agriculture 
— 
a 
non-profit 

organization that works to improve 
farming techniques in developing 
countries — this study aims to analyze 

data on, and improve, sustainable diets 
in Kenya and Vietnam. According 
to the Michigan News, poor-quality 
diets underlie many diseases, while 
agricultural production contributes 
to greenhouse gas emissions. In 
Kenya and Vietnam, almost a quarter 
of preschool-age children are stunted 
and the countries face increasing 
obesity.

Andrew Jones, John G. Searle 

Associate Professor of Nutritional 
Sciences at the School of Public 
Health, is the project leader.

According to Jones, CIAT has 

committed to addressing sustainable 
food systems in Kenya and Vietnam. 
It is supported by the Agriculture 
for Nutrition and Health research 
program; both CIAT and A4NH are 
part of CGIAR — a global research 
partnership for sustainability. 

“They’re very much interested 

in understanding how to carry out 
research that looks at food systems 
and sustainability of food systems 
and also to develop, not just research 
for the sake of new knowledge, but 
also to put it into action and make 
sure it is applied for further human 
development goals,” he said.

Jones explained the researchers 

are looking at data on diets, nutrition 
of women and children and many 
aspects of food systems, such as 
environmental impacts of food and 
spatial data sets to help understand 
distribution of different aspects of 
food systems.

“We’re trying to bring together 

currently-available 
data 
to 

understand where the gaps are 
in terms of what our knowledge 
is 
around 
food 
systems 
and 

sustainability of food systems and 
also to understand what are the 
information needs of key stakeholders 
in these countries — decision-makers, 
in particular, who are going to be 
making decisions around what our 
food systems will look like ten years 
from now, twenty years from now, 
thirty years for now, and how to make 
them sustainable,” he said.

LSA senior Selena Joarder is the 

president of FeelGood, a student 
organization that seeks a “sustainable 
end to extreme poverty,” according to 
its website. 

In an email, Joarder noted the 

importance of the study’s impact on 
policy.

“Sustainable 
food 
systems 

and 
sustainable 
diets 
promote 

environmental 
and 
individual 

health,” she wrote.

Ann Arbor observes
May Day by social
inequality protest

University research buildings 
honored in competition for 
increased energy efficiency 

Hundreds of students 
and organizers gathered 
for festival with social 

and political focus

By EDUARDO BATISTA

Daily Staff Reporter

On Monday, hundreds of students 

and organizers gathered in Ann 
Arbor for the May Day Festival of 
Resistance, an event with a social and 
political focus.

The origin of May Day dates back 

to 1886, when the Federation of 
Organized Trades and Labor Unions 
proclaimed on May 1 that eight hours 
of work would constitute a legal work 
day. Since then, workers from all 
around the globe gather on that day 
to protest against harsh and illegal 
working conditions.

Despite the protest’s historical 

focus on denouncing poor labor 
conditions, May Day has grown 
throughout the years to tackle other 
issues, such as social struggles and 
liberation movements.

In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
specifically, 

protesters said they strived to not 
only criticize capitalist practices, but 
also to raise awareness about the 
water crisis in Flint.

Rackham 
student 
Katherine 

Crocker said she joined the protest 
because she is against both fascist 
and capitalist movements.

“A friend texted me saying there 

was an anti-fascist, anti-capitalist 
protest, so I got my red-shirt from 
my office and joined,” she said. “I 
am 
personally 
strongly 
against 

capitalism and all of the many racist 
policies and laws we have that were 
enacted by the Southern colonial 
project.”

At this year’s May Day event, 

representatives 
from 
several 

nationally-organized 
social 

movements protested in the streets 
of Ann Arbor. Among these groups 
were A Day Without Immigrants, the 
Movement for Black Lives and the 
Women’s Strike Committee.

Protesters were also careful not 

to identify themselves as leaders of 
the movement, calling it instead a 
“leaderless protest,” in the words 

of historian Peter Linebaugh. Now 
retired, Linebaugh has taught history 
at several universities including 
Harvard and Tufts University. He is 
also the author of “The Incomplete, 
True, Authentic, and Wonderful 
History of May Day.”

Linebaugh explained May Day 

is a celebration of life, as well as a 
gathering meant to enlighten students 
of the false information being 
conveyed to them. He referenced 
the struggle for water in South 
America. In an article Linebaugh 
wrote for CounterPunch on Sunday, 
he mentioned the struggle for clean 
drinking water in Cochabamba, 
Bolivia. 

“May Day is a festival of life,” 

Linebaugh said. “It’s a festival of red 
blood whose basis is water. This is 
what is being threatened around the 
world, our blood and our water…The 
indigenous people of South America 
have fought for water as a human 
right rather than something to be 
privatized by the corporate pigs and 
butchers who rule us and through 
the International Monetary Fund 
with false ideological concepts such 
as progress and development. These 
are sham notions that are conveyed to 
our students as if it was knowledge.”

Students walking by the Diag said 

they recognize the protest’s aim to 
discuss social issue, but were having 
trouble identifying the main message 
of the protest. One student, Business 
sophomore 
Christina 
Panagoulia 

Triantafillopoulos, 
believed 
the 

protest was about police brutality.

“I really don’t know what it’s 

about; I think it’s about race brutality 
perhaps,” Triantafillopoulos said. 

Education sophomore Madeleine 

Caughey said she thought the protest 
was about mass incarceration due to 
the group’s chants.

“I think it might be about mass 

incarceration,” she said. “They were 
saying abolish slavery, abolish mass 
incarceration.”

Linebaugh said that ultimately, the 

overall message of the protest was to 
bring awareness to, as well as change, 
the current class system based on the 
wealth of the one percent. 

“In fact what we have organized 

is a class system for the enrichment 
of the 1 percent,” he said. “The final 
thought is that we can change this 

Kellogg Eye Center 

achieves annual 

savings increase of 

$15,000

By CORY ZAYANCE

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

Kellogg 
Eye 
Center 
and 

Medical 
Science 
Research 

Building 
III 
were 
honored 

last week after dramatically 
increasing 
their 
energy 

efficiency during the Michigan 
Battle of the Buildings — an 
energy reduction competition 
for businesses in the state of 
Michigan.

The Michigan Battle of the 

Buildings is a program that 
honors reductions in energy 
use and is open to all industrial, 
commercial and multifamily 
residential buildings in the 
state that runs from March 31 
to Dec. 31 every year. 

Liz Boyd, spokeswoman for 

the Battle of the Buildings, 
shared the competition’s goals 
for Michigan companies and 
buildings.

“It is a friendly competition 

designed for buildings to be 
more 
energy 
efficient, 
and 

they also provide information 
for companies to become more 
energy efficient,” Boyd said. 
“It’s all about promoting energy 
efficiency. There are easy steps 
buildings can take to save 
energy and money.”

The 2017 Energy Summit 

celebrated 
the 
2016 

competition’s “biggest losers” 
and welcomed new competitors 
for 2017. In addition to the 
awards 
presentation, 
the 

Summit featured peer-to-peer 
learning platforms for attendees 
to 
learn 
how 
Michigan 

companies 
are 
reducing 

their 
energy 
consumption 

without sacrificing comfort or 
productivity. Keynote speakers 
were 
also 
in 
attendance, 

discussing a range of energy-
related topics.

Cheri Holman, Battle of the 

Buildings creator, shared the 
main focus of the competition.

“The overall goal is to educate 

on energy efficient practices 
within the state and to gather 
energy leaders so they can all 
learn from each other,” Holman 
said.

The University of Michigan 

Kellogg Eye Center, Michigan’s 
number 
one 
ranked 
eye 

center, achieved an energy-
use reduction of 5.30 percent 
and annual savings increase of 
$15,000. This feat was achieved 

by adjusting the exhaust fans to 
rebalance the air flow through 
the building.

David Shaw, Regional Energy 

Manager of University Energy 
Management, provided a reason 
for this change.

“As buildings are used and age, 

the controls can drift or fail,” 
Shaw said. “Recommissioning 
brings our systems back to what 
they were designed to do and 
restores them to their original 
efficiency.”

Medical 
Science 
Research 

Building 
III 
managed 
to 

increase its energy efficiency 
by 
implementing 
a 
series 

of 
conservation 
efforts. 

These 
advances 
included 

recommissioning the facility’s 
office 
and 
lab 
ventilation 

controls, the installation of 

occupancy sensors in offices and 
encouraging building occupants 
to turn off lights and close fume 
hood sashes when not in use. 
These efforts resulted in a net 
decrease in energy use of 21.5 
percent.

“The education is that there 

is simple, low-hanging fruit 
to 
innovative 
technology,” 

Holman 
said. 
“A 
mix 
of 

everything is what we are 
encouraging.”

The 
Energy 
Management 

Team’s five managers, who 
worked on both the Kellogg 
Eye 
Center 
and 
Medical 

Science Research Building III’s 
renovations, are now tasked 
with helping the University 
reach its goal of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 
25 percent by 2025. Up to now, 
the University has managed 
to reduce its emissions by 8 
percent per year.

“The 
energy 
savings 

achieved at the Kellogg Eye 
Building and Medical Sciences 
Research Building III directly 
contribute to this goal,” Shaw 
said. 

The University hopes to 

meet their sustainability goal 
by looking for efficiency gains 
from energy they buy and 
produce and how energy is 
used in current buildings.

Planet 
Blue, 
the 

University’s multidisciplinary 
sustainability 
initiative, 

is 
committed 
to 
fostering 

sustainability 
education, 

research 
and 
community 

engagement on campus. By 
2025, the University aims to cut 
greenhouse gas emissions by 
25 percent, obtain 20 percent 
of its food from sustainable 
sources and decrease vehicle 
carbon output, among other 
efforts. 

Shaw shared the University’s 

future projections for energy 
reduction and savings. 

“We look continually for new 

technologies and new ways 
to use existing equipment to 
cost-effectively maintain and 
operate our buildings safely 
and efficiently,” Shaw said.

The education 
is that there 
is simple, low-
hanging fruit 
to innovative 

technology, a mix 

of everything 
is what we are 
encouraging.

Michigan Softball Academy makes impact

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

stepped from the first baseline toward 
home plate. Her smile couldn’t have 
been larger.

“Alright, let’s go baserunners,” she 

screamed emphatically. 

Unlike most cases, though, she 

wasn’t critiquing her players’ form 
or implementing game strategy. 
Hutchins was rooting on a handful 
of the participants at the 8th annual 
Michigan Softball Academy.

And looking around, it was hard to 

find anybody at the facility — coaches, 
players, staff, participants — without 
that same beaming smile.

The Softball Academy is a training 

camp-esque 
environment, 
run 

by the players and coaching staff. 
Participants, donned in pink, rotated 
through stations run by the players, 
working on a different skill at each 
spot. The event’s culmination was 
a social mixer after the on-field 
activities. 

In its eight-year existence, the 

program has raised over $700,000, 
according to Hutchins, with hopes of 
surpassing $1 million soon. All of the 
proceeds go to the American Cancer 
Society with the intent of fighting 
breast cancer. This year’s event raised 
a total of $135,207.

The Academy was created in 2010 

at the Michigan softball summer 
camp. The team had participated in 
a walk for breast cancer awareness 
prior, so the issue was already on 
Hutchins’ mind. Then, when several 
parents who were dropping off their 
kids jokingly asked why they couldn’t 
also run the bases — and perhaps 
drink wine afterwards — the idea for 
the academy was born.

Hutchins 
had 
several 

conversations with Tami Rummel 

at the American Cancer Society, and 
thus, the Michigan Softball Academy 
was formed.

And for the veteran coach, the 

message of the event to her team is 
clear.

“Life isn’t about you, life is 

about making this world better, 
and 
making 
your 
community 

better,” Hutchins said. “We have 
this platform in this fantastic 
environment 
called 
Michigan 

softball, with these priviledged kids 
need to leave here understanding 
that they’re the luckiest people on 
earth, that they’re very priviledged, 
and their duty is to give back to this 
community.”

Janet Quaine is an original 

member, having gone to the event 
regularly since its inception in 2010. A 
breast cancer survivor treated at the 
University’s clinics who was also an 
avid softball player and fan, Quaine 
marveled at the importance of the 
event — and the job Hutchins has 
done promoting it to participants and 
players alike.

“I was under the age of 50 and 

had breast cancer that… most of the 
time you’re not even supposed to get 
a mammogram,” Quaine said. “It 
kind of all fit together, because I love 
softball and U-of-M saved my life.” 

“It’s just very nice that all the 

girls take all this time to do this, and 
Coach Hutch is just awesome to do 
that… there’s just smiles and grins 
everywhere. … All goes for a good 
cause, too.”

The participants are here for a 

good cause, no doubt. But they’re also 
here to play softball — some more 
seriously than others.

“I was checking the MVPs into the 

locker room,” Quaine said. “Some of 
the people were coming and saying, 
‘You didn’t bring a glove?’ ”

Quaine, a former shortstop, hung 

up her glove several years ago. She 
played softball throughout her youth 
and after high school. Times were 
different then, and she never pursued 
a chance to play in college. 

“I came from the thumb,” she 

said, pointing to her small, rural 
hometown of Westland, Michigan. 
“So it was Class D, and nobody ever 
said ‘Hey, you should go to college 
and play ball,’ which I probably 
should have.”

For people like Quaine — who 

now works in the University’s 
clinical department — the event 
cultivates a fun softball atmosphere 
while serving as a crucial fundraiser 
for the future of cancer research. 
For Hutchins, it also doubles as a 
necessary educational experience for 
her team.

“Years ago, when we first did 

this, (former football coach) Lloyd 
Carr asked me ‘Why do you pick 
the night before your biggest 
weekend of the year’ — which is 
typically when we have it — to do 
this?” Hutchins said. 

“And I said, ‘Because, there’s 

nothing like giving, giving, giving 
to make kids really understand 
that this world isn’t about them. 
And 
honestly, 
their 
sense 
of 

empowerment, the joy they get in 
knowing they’re contributing to 
such a great cause, I mean they’re 
proud as peacocks, and they have a 
great time doing it.”

Sophomore 
catcher 
Alex 

Sobczak, one of the many Michigan 
softball players with ear-to-ear 
grins today, certainly heeded that 
advice.

“Personally, it’s my favorite time 

of year,” Sobczak said, in reference 
to the Pink Game and the Softball 
Academy. “To give back and just 
realize how much these people are 
sacrificing for a greater cause.”

Michigan fires men’s 
and women’s coaches

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
and 

women’s lacrosse teams will be 
getting a fresh 
start on the field 
with the opening 
of 
the 
South 

Competition and 
Performance 
Complex in 2018. 
But this isn’t the 
Wolverines’ only 
fresh start – they 
will 
also 
have 

new 
coaches 

leading 
them 

into their new 
home.

Athletic 
director 
Warde 

Manuel 
announced 
Tuesday 

that men’s coach John Paul and 
women’s coach Jennifer Ulehla 
will not be returning next 
season.

After 
70 

years as a club 
sport, Michigan 
elevated its men’s 
lacrosse program 
to varsity status 
in 2011. The team 
began 
NCAA 

competition the 
next year with 
its first official 
game, a 12-9 
loss to Detroit. Paul previously 
had coached Michigan’s club 
lacrosse team for 14 seasons, 
and continued as head coach 
with the Wolverines’ move to 
NCAA competition in 2012.

In six seasons at the helm, 

Paul recorded a record of 23-61, 
with a 2-24 record in Big Ten 
play. His last season was his 
most successful – Michigan 
won a program-record eight 
games, 
finished 
above 
.500 

for the first time in program 
history, and defeated No. 10 
Penn for its first-ever win over 
a ranked opponent. However, 
the Wolverines were winless in 
five games against conference 
opponents.

“We are extremely grateful 

to John for his personal and 
professional 
investment 
in 

helping to build the varsity 
lacrosse 
program,” 
Manuel 

said in a statement. “John has 

invested 
over 

two decades in 
the 
growth 
of 

lacrosse at the 
University

In 
the 
Michigan 
baseball 

team’s game against Rutgers 
Saturday, what should have been 
a harmless first inning fly-out 
was anything but.

Left 
fielder 
Miles 
Lewis 

sprinted into the gap in left-
center field in pursuit of a 
high 
fly 
ball 

off the bat of 
Scarlet Knight 
designated hitter 
Mike 
Carter. 

Meanwhile, 
senior 
center 

fielder 
Johnny 

Slater ran just 
as hard towards 
the ball — and 
Lewis.

As 
the 
two 

outfielders converged at full 
speed, Lewis slid to catch the 
ball. Slater dove over him, and 
his knee collided with Lewis’s 
forehead, knocking the redshirt 
sophomore to the turf. After 
nearly 10 seconds, Lewis rose 
from the ground a “bloody 
mess”, according to Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich.

Bakich 
has 
previously 

described Lewis – a former 
high school football player – as 
“absolutely shredded, ripped, 
very strong” and “someone who 
could play tailback for Coach 
Harbaugh”. 
So 
even 
though 

Lewis required nine stitches 
in his forehead, that wasn’t the 
immediate concern.

“It was a clean cut, it was 

across his eyebrows and up,” 
Bakich said. “I was worried that 
he might have some dizziness or 
symptoms of a concussion, but 
he described it as a football hit. 
I didn’t think he’d return that 
quickly.”

Yet 
there 
was 
Lewis 
– 

concussion-free – back in the 
lineup 
and 
batting 
second 

Sunday. And as if the previous 
day’s 
incident 
had 
never 

happened, he laced two hits in 
his first three at-bats and scored 
two runs.

Slater, 
though, 
wasn’t 
as 

lucky. The senior center-fielder 
appeared fine immediately after 
he exited the game along with 
Lewis after the collision. But a 

short time later, Slater and the 
coaching staff discovered that 
the AC joint in his shoulder was 
sprained.

“When you have a sprain of 

a joint it’s kind of day-to-day, 
week-to-week,” Bakich said. “He 
will be back this season, I just 
don’t know if it’s going to be this 
weekend, next weekend or the 
weekend after that.”

It seems strange 

to say that such a 
gruesome accident 
could 
have 
a 

silver lining. But 
coming off a 12-5 
blowout 
loss 
in 

the series opener 
against 
Rutgers, 

Bakich pointed to 
the collision as a 
turning point in 
the weekend – and 

possibly the season.

“It was definitely something 

that 
we 
talked 
about 

immediately,” 
Bakich 
said. 

“Gathering the team together 
and saying, we’re going to have 
to fight our asses off without 
these guys and we’re going to 
have to do it for 
them.

“That 
was 
a 

defining moment 
in the weekend 
where 
that 

weekend 
could 

have 
gone 
one 

of two ways. It 
would have been 
easy to point to 
a losing weekend 
and the reasoning 
and the excuse that we had a 
couple big injuries. But our guys 
did a great job of not letting that 
be a reason.”

Perhaps most importantly, the 

most important contributions 
to Michigan’s series-clinching 
wins on Saturday and Sunday 
came from the players who were 
directly called upon to replace 
Michigan’s injured starters.

Saturday, freshman Christian 

Bullock replaced Lewis in left, 
while redshirt freshman Joe 
Pace took Slater’s spot in center. 
Despite having combined for just 
14 at-bats up to that point, the 
pair made an immediate impact. 
Pace went 2-4 with a double, 
while Bullock was 1-2 with two 

RBIs and a stolen base.

Meanwhile, 
sophomore 

Jimmy Kerr started all three 
games at second base due to 
sophomore Ako Thomas’s broken 
hand suffered last week against 
Indiana. In the five games 
Thomas has missed, Kerr hasn’t 
just held down the fort: he’s hit 
.571, including seven hits in 10 
at-bats and three RBIs against 
Rutgers — a performance that 
earned him Big Ten Player of the 
Week honors.

Much 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

success this season has stemmed 
from their consistency. Since 
Slater was moved to the second 
spot in the lineup for the 
first time against Maryland, 
Michigan’s batting order has 
remained for the most part 
unchanged, 
and 
with 
great 

success — until Thomas’s injury 
against Indiana, the Wolverines 
had been on a 14-1 streak.

However, lineup consistency, 

while 
overwhelmingly 

beneficial, comes with a catch 
– it is heavily contingent on 
health.

For 
most 
of 
the 
season, 

Michigan 
has 

enjoyed 
nearly 

perfect 
health. 

Against Indiana 
and Rutgers, for 
the 
first 
time, 

this 
was 
not 

the 
case. 
The 

Wolverines knew 
they needed to 
adapt.

“We 
had 

to 
make 
the 

adjustment to our offense, in 
terms of, we might have to do 
some things we haven’t done 
as much of in the past,” Bakich 
said. “Bunting, some gadget 
plays, and running different 
types of defenses. But that’s 
what we train for as well.”

Obviously, Michigan would 

rather not wait for Thomas and 
Slater to return to the lineup. 
But once they do, the Wolverines 
will be a different team than 
before. Their ability to adjust 
and react immediately to injuries 
or other unforeseen changes was 
unknown until just recently.

Saturday and Sunday, this 

ability was tested, and Michigan 
passed the test.

Wolverines place ninth 
at Big Ten Tournament

Over 
the 
weekend, 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
golf 
team 

started its postseason play at 
the Big Ten Championship at 
the Baltimore Country Club in 
Maryland, looking for a better 
result than its 11th place finish 
at the last tournament. This 
turned out to be a challenging 
task 
due 
to 
unexpected 

injuries, 
but 

nevertheless, 
the 
Wolverines 

shot 878 (296-
288-294) 
to 

finish ninth out 
of 
a 
14-team 

field, 49 strokes 
behind 
the 

winner, Illinois.

“We 
had 
a 

couple 
guys 

even 
battling 

injuries through 
the week, just not really feeling 
very good, and not being able to 
swing it the way they wanted to 
swing it,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten.

The Wolverines were led by 

sophomore Nick Carlson and 
senior Bryce Evon. Carlson 
was tied for seventh after two 
rounds, and he finished tied for 
16th with a 214 
(71-70-73). Evon 
had 
a 
slower 

start with a 76 
in 
round 
one, 

but 
bounced 

back with a 71 
and 72 in the 
final rounds for 
a total of 219. 
Evon 
finished 

tied for 33rd.

“I think two 

of our guys, Nick Carlson 
and Bryce Evon, played very 
steady golf. I’m sure they still 
wish they had played better,” 
Whitten said. “Nick had one of 
his more poor events the last 
time out, and worked hard and 
made some good changes and 
led our team this week which 
was good to see. Bryce was 
very consistent this week and I 
thought he did a good job. Those 

two guys were improved.”

Seniors Reed Hrynewich and 

Tom Swanson and junior Kyle 
Mueller were in Michigan’s 
lineup as well and finished tied 
for 41st, 66th, and tied for 44th 
respectively.

“Overall, (we) were good 

around 
the 
greens 
which 

I 
thought 
would 
be 
the 

challenging part of this golf 
course, and we just struggled 
in 
our 
approach 
shots,” 

Whitten 
said. 

“Getting the ball 
positioned was a 
big deal. … (The 
greens) had a lot 
of tilt and if you 
missed the green 
in 
the 
wrong 

place 
there 

was almost no 
chance to pitch 
the ball close.”

On Thursday, 

the NCAA will 

reveal which teams are selected 
to move on to the Regional 
Championships, 
which 
will 

take place May 15-17.

“We 
have 
to 
wait 
until 

Thursday 
to 
see 
how 
the 

rankings change and if we’ll be 
selected for the postseason for 
the NCAA Regionals,” Whitten 
said. “Until that time we’re just 

gonna 
prepare 

assuming 
that 

we’re gonna go. 
I think we have 
a 
really 
good 

chance 
to 
be 

selected.”

Michigan 

could 
make 
a 

deep postseason 
run if it keeps 
improving, 
especially 
if 

it isn’t further troubled by 
injuries.

“Some guys need to get 

healthy and actually need some 
rest — maybe about three days 
of rest,” Whitten said. “A couple 
other guys need to get back to 
work on their game. We will 
probably have a little bit of 
qualifying within the team to 
determine the lineup for the 
postseason.”

Michigan now awaits NCAA Tournament

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In its 10th annual “Pink Game” 

to raise awareness for breast 
cancer, the Michigan softball 
team capped off an undefeated 
regular season home record with 
an 8-0 run-rule victory over 
Western Michigan Tuesday. 

The win gave the Wolverines 

(38-10-1 overall, 17-3 Big Ten) a 
perfect home record of 17-0 to 
end the season, a feat it hasn’t 
accomplished since 2009.

Western Michigan (21-26, 9-12 

Mid-American) entered the game 
hoping to play spoiler, as winners 
of five of its last six. But in a swift, 
one hour and sixteen minute 
affair, 
Michigan 
emphatically 

took care of its business against 
its MAC foe, pairing 11 hits and 
five extra-base hits with a shutout 
start from Tera Blanco. The 
junior right-hander shut down 
the Broncos in efficient fashion, 
allowing just four baserunners 
and needing to throw just 63 
pitches to put the Broncos away.

Sophomore second baseman 

Faith 
Canfield 
sparked 
the 

blowout early with her seventh 
home run of the season in the 
bottom of the first. With the first 
two runners on base, Canfield 
took an 0-2 pitch on the outside 
corner and shot the ball to right-
centerfield on a line, just clearing 

the fence. 

And it was off to the races 

for a Michigan offense that has 
barely left the track in nearly two 
weeks.

In the bottom of the 3rd inning, 

senior third baseman Lindsay 
Montemarano skied a high fly 
ball down the left field line which 
landed in the bullpen just right of 
the foul pole. The power could be 
a welcome sign for Montemarano, 
who is now hitting .500 in her last 
nine starts after hitting .226 prior 
to that stretch.

The senior attributes that 

improvement to her emphasis on 
the lower body. 

“I’ve been working on getting 

some whip in, using my legs 
a lot more than I had been in 
the beginning of the season,” 
Montemarano said. “I was using 
way too much upper body, I 
formed a couple of bad habits due 
to a couple of things going on.

“But I feel really loose and 

really strong in my lower half, 
and I’ve been working really hard 
on getting some whip back. I’m 
seeing the ball well and trusting 
the work that I’m putting into it.”

Added Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins: 
“(Montemarano’s) 

working. She’s coming in early, 
and she’s accepting constructive 
criticism, and she’s accepting 
ideas. She’s had better energy, 
and I think as you play better, 

you get better energy. Hopefully 
hitting her stride. Good time to 
hit it.”

Sophomore 
catcher 
Alex 

Sobczak capped the game off 
with a solo home run to right-
centerfield in the bottom of the 
fifth. The sophomore has forced 
her way back into the lineup 
after losing the catcher battle to 
start the season to sophomore 
Katie Alexander.

“Alex is another one who 

just 
stayed 
on 
course 
even 

though things didn’t go her way 
throughout a good period of the 
year,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “I’m happy some of her 
hard work is paying off, because 
she’s worked hard.”

With 
three 
more 
home 

runs Tuesday, the Wolverines 
have now hit 11 in their past 4 
games, and 14 over the past six 
games, with production coming 
throughout the lineup.

The next time Michigan will 

play at Alumni Field will be the 
end of next week, for the Big 
Ten Tournament. And for the 
first time possibly all season, 
Hutchins thinks her team is 
ready.

“I want consistency in our 

offense,” Hutchins said. 

“And I don’t want to get ahead 

of myself, but I sure feel like 
I’ve seen it these past couple of 
weeks.”

Michigan run-rules Broncos in final regular season home game
Michigan falls in Big 
Ten Championships

After a long rally, freshman Chiara 

Lommer changed the direction of the 
ball and hit an inside-out forehand 
across the court. But the ball landed 
just wide, ending the Michigan 
women’s tennis team’s chance of 
winning the Big Ten Tournament 
Championship.

The Wolverines overcame Indiana 

and Northwestern in the early rounds 
of the tournament, winning 4-0 and 
4-1, respectively. However, Michigan 
fell in the final to Ohio State, 4-0.

Michigan had its best results when 

it got out to an early lead. Against 
both the Hoosiers and the Wildcats, 
the Wolverines clinched the doubles 
point easily.

Lommer and sophomore Brienne 

Minor handily took care of their 
Indiana opponents, dusting them 
6-0. But it was the No. 3 doubles 
pair of junior Mira Ruder-Hook 
and freshman Valeria Patiuk who 
clinched the point for the Wolverines. 
After losing the first two games, the 
duo rallied to win five straight games, 
eventually taking the match, 6-3.

Ruder-Hook and Patiuk were 

the first off the court against 
Northwestern, but it was sophomore 
Kate Fahey and junior Alex Najarian’s 
turn to win the doubles point against 
the Wildcats. Fahey and Najarian 
charged the net, forcing the Wildcats 
to sail the ball long.

When it came to singles play, 

Michigan didn’t slow down. Najarian 
dropped the Wolverines’ lone singles 
match, but she still managed to force 
it to three sets. Fortunately for the 
Wolverines, Minor and Fahey battled 
to win their three-set matches to 
send Michigan to the finals.

Earlier in the year, the Wolverines 

faced the Buckeyes as part of their 
non-conference slate. Ohio State 
came out in top form, winning the 
matchup 5-1, and Sunday’s final was 
no different.

After taking the No. 3 and No. 

2 doubles matches, 6-2 and 6-3, 
respectively, Michigan was in an 
early hole.

“We knew the doubles point 

was going to be important and we 
unfortunately came out on the wrong 
side of it,” said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. “There was a big deuce 
point at No. 2 that we didn’t win that 
could have gotten that match back on 
track. With the way doubles works 

now, you have to get a good start and 
we came out of the gates a little slow.”

The Buckeyes continued their 

domination into singles play by 
winning all six first sets.

Perhaps the most anticipated 

match of the day was the No. 1 singles 
contest between Fahey and top-
ranked Francesca Di Lorenzo. The 
pair kept the match close, exchanging 
breaks back and forth. But it was 
eventually Di Lorenzo who claimed 
the first set, 7-5.

The 
match 
was 
abandoned, 

however, after Lommer’s loss gave 
Ohio State their fourth point. 

The second point came against 

Patiuk, who dropped the first set, 6-0, 
and fell into a 5-1 hole in the second, 
but still managed to fight off two 
match points. But a driving forehand 
down the line from the Buckeyes’ 
Ferny Angeles Paz sealed the match.

The next Wolverine off the court 

was Najarian. She approached the net 
and attempted to hit her opponents’ 
return cross court, but sent it into the 
bottom of the net to put Ohio State 
within one point of the championship.

At the conclusion of the contest, 

the three remaining matches were 
abandoned. Ruder-Hook had just 
won the second set, Minor managed 
to force a third set, and Fahey was in a 
3-0 hole in the second set. Things may 
have turned around for Michigan, 
but it was all too little too late.

“We had our work cut out for us in 

singles and we weren’t able to get it 
done,” Bernstein said. “(Fahey) hung 
in there at No. 1 and played a great 
match. (Minor) and (Ruder-Hook) 
were able to stay on court with wins 
in their second sets. 

“We played well in some spots 

and not so great at some others, but 
it is a team sport and you need to 
win at multiple spots.”

While the Wolverines didn’t 

manage to win the Tournament, 
they will likely still have a chance 
to continue their season in the 
NCAA Tournament. They will 
learn their fate on May 2 and can 
hopefully learn from the loss to the 
Buckeyes.

“As much as this hurts, we still 

have a lot of tennis left this season,” 
Bernstein said. “We have a really 
good chance of hosting the first 
and second rounds of the NCAA 
Tournament and we are looking 
forward to that. We will get back 
to practice this week and get ready 
for the rest of the postseason.”
