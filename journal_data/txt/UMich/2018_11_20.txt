At the end of each semester, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

students are asked to submit 
evaluations for the courses 
they have taken in that term. 
One of the most important 
metrics 
for 
introductory-

level courses is how much 
interest they generate in the 
field. Rankings are based on 
the percentage of students 
who answered some form of 
“yes” when asked, “Did this 
course increase interest in 
the field?” The top results for 
introductory classes are listed 
below:

ASIANLAN 
125: 
First 

Year Japanese I (94 percent)

Ranked 
highest 
on 
the 

list, First Year Japanese I is 
designed for students with no 
prior Japanese knowledge and 
focuses on the fundamentals 
of learning a new language. 
According to Mayumi Oka, 
director 
of 
the 
Japanese 

language program, this first-
year course stresses several 
key skills of the language.

“We do reading, writing, 

speaking and listening,” Oka 
said. “We teach everything 
like conversation and how 
to write characters, and we 
introduce Japanese culture. 
Culture is very important.”

The class focuses on an 

understanding 
of 
Japanese 

culture as well. According 
to 
Kinesiology 
freshman 

Xincheng 
Yuan, 
the 
class 

generates 
interest 
by 

appealing to the U.S. interest 
in different facets of Japanese 
culture.

“I think Japanese culture 

is popular in America with 
anime and manga and those 
games,” Yuan said. “I think 
many people are trying to 
learn about these in Japanese 
to better play the things that 
they like.”

LHSP 
125: 
College 

Writing (88 percent)

With various sections of this 

course including “Writing and 
Seeing,” “Writing Genres,” 
“Monsters and Beasts” and 
more, this course in the 
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program 
offers several unique lenses 
while also providing a base 
of writing skills. According 
to Shelley Mannis, professor 
of “Our TV, Our Selves: The 

Rhetoric 
of 
Television,” 

the various sections allow 
students to use writing to 
analyze the world around 
them.

“A big part of this course, 

too, is helping students learn 
how to find real conversations 
happening 
in 
the 
world 

around things that they’re 
interested in,” Mannis wrote 
in an email to The Daily. “In 

After

CAMPUS LIFE

The Black Student Union 

held an event and exhibit 
in Mason Hall on Monday 
to commemorate the fifth 
anniversary 
of 
#BBUM, 
 

which 
stands 
for 
“Being 

Black at the University of 
Michigan.” 
The 
display 

included a large poster where 
students could share what 
it means to be Black at the 
University of Michigan in 
colored chalk.

On 
Nov. 
19, 
2013, 

BSU 
launched 
a 

movement 
that 
brought 

Black students’ experiences 
at the University to light, 
with 
the 
viral 
hashtag, 

protest 
and 
institutional 

demands. BBUM represents 
a 
watershed 
moment 
of 

viral 
student 
activism 
on 

campus. A “hood ratchet” 
party organized by Theta 
Xi, a predominantly white 
fraternity, 
catalyzed 
the 

BSU’s launch of the hashtag 

used in 10,000 tweets in its 
first two days.

LSA 
senior 
Kayla 

McKinney, president of BSU, 
said the event was intended 
to give students a space to 
reflect on the past five years 
since the hashtag began and 
also on the history of Black 
students at the University in 
general.

“They did a demonstration 

similar to this (five years 
ago),” McKinney said. “This 
was right after the Trayvon 
Martin trial, racist incidents 
on campus, so Black students 
just needed a place to voice 
what was going on.”

This dialogue gave way 

to seven demands addressed 
to 
the 
University. 
Many 
 

of 
the 
demands 
— 
most 

notably, 
the 
perennial 

ask for 10 percent Black 
enrollment — are reiterations 
of 
changes 
sought 
by 

previous 
Black 
Action 

Movements. These reforms 
include 
more 
affordable 

housing, a revamped Race 

Community 
gathers to 
reflect 5 yrs.

Gender identity explored through

200 people attend art event in League hosted by Redefine and Zeta Omega Eta

Featuring a mix of visual art, 

written word and performances by 
University of Michigan students 
with a diverse range of gender 
identities, 
the 
annual 
SHIFT 

talent showcase was held Monday 
to explore and celebrate the theme 
of gender.

Co-hosted by Redefine, a student 

organization dedicated to creating 
platforms for the intersection of art 
and social justice, and Zeta Omega 

Eta, a non-traditional sorority 
focused on the advancement of 
feminist ideals, the event first 
allowed attendees to browse a wall 
of visual art at the entrance of the 
room that showcased drawings, 
photographs, poetry and prose. 
The artwork had a variety of 
messages presenting the artists’ 
experiences of gender, from its 
intersection with ethnicity to 
societal gender pressures.

Kendall Sidnam, co-president of 

Redefine and one of the organizers 
of the event, emphasized the 
mission of Redefine to provide a 

space for artists at the University 
to express themselves.

“To be able to have a safe 

and brave space where they 
can showcase their art without 
judgment and with full support 
and accessibility ... Having a space 
that’s solely devoted to them and 
their work and their talent is 
really important for them to feel 
supported in whatever identity 
they have,” Sidnam said.

The organizers later shifted 

into the performance portion 
of event with a video asking 
University students about genders 

norms they’d like to see changed 
and what gender empowerment 
meant to them. Launching from 
these ideas, one of the emcees, LSA 
senior Mandy Coterillo, explained 
the idea of the “gender unicorn” to 
the audience.

“The 
gender 
unicorn 
is 

divided 
into 
gender 
identity, 

gender expression, sex assigned 
at birth, physically attracted to, 
and emotionally attracted to…” 
Coterillo said. “The unicorn works 
in a spectrum.”

The University of Michigan 

Senate 
Assembly 
convened 

Monday 
afternoon 
in 
the 

Michigan League to discuss 
the implications of electronic 
voting 
and 
participation 
in 

future meetings as well as what 
responsibilities 
University 

faculty hold regarding letters of 
recommendation.

After opening the meeting 

with 
announcements, 
Senate 

Assembly Chair Neil Marsh, 
professor 
of 
chemistry, 

opened the floor for discussion 
about electronic voting and 
participation in future Faculty 
Senate 
meetings. 
Remote 

participation would be achieved 
through video chat platforms 
like Bluejeans or Skype. The 
discussion was a response to 
concerns that quorums rarely 
occur due to the participation 
minimum 
of 
100 
faculty 

members. As a result, there 
have only been three instances 
in which a faculty quorum has 
been able to vote on issues since 
2004.

“We never get a quorum,

only when a crisis comes up … 
Which is not the best time to 
make policies,” Marsh said.

Other assembly members, 

including Social Work professor 
Shanna Kattari, agreed the 
Senate Assembly would benefit 
from electronic participation 
because the current meetings 
are not accessible to many 
faculty members.

“It’s a (Diversity, Equity, and 

Inclusion) issue with access 
… Someone who is disabled … 
Who has children … in any other 
situation could use Bluejeans,” 
Kattari said.

U-M 
Dearborn 

professor 
Caitlin 
Finlayson 

echoed 
Kattari, 
saying 

during 
the 
workday 
with 

“other 
communities 
and 

responsibilities” it is difficult 
for her to travel the hour to 
Ann Arbor to participate in 
meetings.

Those opposed to electronic 

participation 
expressed 

concerns 
that 
faculty 

could 
experience 
technical 

difficulties preventing them 
from 
participating. 
They 

also 
worried 
video 
chat 

participation would make it 
more difficult to discern what is 
happening at what time during 
the 
meeting 
with 
possible 

delays in connection.

Assembly 
member 
John 

Traynor, a professor in the 
Medical School, brought up 
another concern. He worried 
the assembly may actually have 
less participation if people are 
able to participate online.

“Will people even bother to 

participate?” Traynor said. “Or 
will they switch on computer 
and just do other things?”

Courtney 
Snyder, 
a 

professor in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance, said 
assembly 
members 
needed 

to “think carefully about the 
implications” 
of 
assembly 

meetings 
being 
broadcast 

online, fearing it created an 
opportunity 
for 
retaliation 

from 
administration 
and 

colleagues against statements 
made in meetings.

The 
conversation 
then 

switched to the rules and 
nuances of how electronic 
participation would be carried 
out. 
Assembly 
members 

expressed 
concerns 
that 

participation 
will 
vary 

depending on what platform 

is 
used 
for 
participation. 

There was also concern that 
as the group gets larger, it may 
become more difficult to pass 
motions.

After the discussion, 

via 
straw 
polls, 
the 

assembly 
voted 
in 

favor of four proposals: 
remote participation for 
the 
Senate 
Assembly, 

electronic 
voting 
for 

Senate Assembly, remote 
participation 
for 
the 

Faculty 
Senate 
and 

remote voting for the 
Faculty Senate. Though 
these polls do not hold 
any governmental power, 
they gauge the Assembly’s 
thoughts on future steps.

“How 
do 
we 
move 

forward now that we 
know there is interest in 
moving forward?” asked 
Ruth 
Carlos, 
Senate 

Assembly member and 
professor of radiology.

During 
the 
second 

half of the meeting, the 
assembly broke into small 
groups to discuss the 
implications of a recent 
controversy 
concerning 

the duty of University 
faculty to write letters 
of 
recommendation. 

This 
dialogue 
follows 

the 
University’s 
choice 

to discipline Prof. John Cheney-
Lippold for rescinding his offer 
to write a student a letter of 
recommendation upon learning 
that the letter would be used 
for a study abroad program 
in Israel. The small groups 
then reported to the larger 
group, which would send out 
its concerns to the Duderstadt 
Blue Ribbon Recommendation 
Letters Panel.

The 
assembly 
members 

discussed any rules in their 
departments 
regarding 

letters 
of 
recommendation, 

key 
concerns 
regarding 

recommendation letters and 
recommendations any faculty 
members have to improve the 
process of writing letters of 
recommendation.

As 
a 
whole, 
assembly 

members were unaware of 
rules 
regarding 
letters 
of 

recommendation 
in 
their 

departments. 
The 
assembly 

members had not heard many 
concerns until recently and 
viewed this situation as an 
outlier.

Assembly 
members 
were 

more concerned about how this 
controversy may set a precedent 
for writing recommendations 
in 
the 
future. 
Specifically, 

members expressed concern 
they would be forced to write a 
recommendation for everyone 
who asked them. Traynor said 
letters 
of 
recommendation 

“would be useless if we went 
to that stage where everyone is 
forced to write a letter”.

Further, assembly members 

expressed concern University 
administrators 
could 
make 

policies 
which 
constitute 

an abuse of power. Traynor 
mentioned rules surrounding 
writing 
recommendations 

could 
easily 
violate 
First 

Amendment 
rights 
to 
free 

speech.

“(Faculty) should be able to 

not support certain institutions 
along 
with 
free 
speech,” 

Traynor said, providing the 
example of the right physicians 
have to refuse to perform 
certain procedures based on 
beliefs.

THXGIVING WEEK. puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

TUESDAY:
By Design 

(Faculty) should 

be able to not 
support certain 

institutions


and Ethnicity requirement and 
emergency scholarships.

Currently, 
Black 
students 

make up just 4.4 percent of the 
University’s 
undergraduate 

population –– a statistic for 
which the University received 
an “F” grade in a report on 
racial 
equity 
published 
by 

the University of Southern 
California. 
In 
October, 

the 
Bentley 
Historical 

Library fulfilled one of BSU’s 
original demands by digitizing 
over 66,000 records from the 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, making 
them available to the public. 
Many students have criticized 
the 
University’s 
race 
and 

ethnicity requirement, which 
still does not apply to some 
schools like the College of 
Engineering, for watered down 
subject matter.

The display on the posting 

walls 
also 
included 
many 

historical events and dates 

of importance for the Black 
community at the University. 
Education 
senior 
Camyrea 

Barnes, secretary of BSU, said 
history is an important aspect 
of the event.

“I hope this event brings 

back remembrance and a sense 
of appreciation for the different 
protests and demonstrations 
that Black students have done 
on this campus to create a more 
equitable 
and 
comfortable 

(campus) for not just Black 
students but other students of 
color,” Barnes said.

McKinney also mentioned 

that the timing of this event 
is appropriate for reflection 
with the initiatives to promote 
student 
diversity, 
equity, 

and 
inclusion 
having 
been 

established for over two years 
now.

“It’s 
a 
great 
transition 
 

year for the University, going 
into year three of the DEI 
and Trotter building on State 
Street, we thought this was 
a perfect time to have some 
reflection to see where we 
should be going,” McKinney 

said.

McKinney 
added 
in 
her 

experience, the past five years 
have brought some positive 
changes in interactions with 
University. 

“In five years the University 

has 
become 
much 
more 

open 
to 
voices 
of 
Black 

students,” 
McKinney 
said. 

“I myself have gotten plenty 
of 
opportunities 
to 
sit 
 

down with the administration 
and voice what’s going on and 
be directly involved with the 
changes that are happening.”

Candidates 
running 
for 

representative 
positions 
in 

LSA 
Student 
Government 

gathered Monday night for 
a candidates’ forum to pitch 
their platforms in preparation 
for the elections on Nov. 26 
and 27. Prospective members 
discussed topics such as dining 
hall 
options, 
accessibility, 

diversity and student health.

LSA SG President Nathan 

Wilson, an LSA senior, said 
the forum gave candidates 
the opportunity to develop 
a platform early on in the 
election process that would 
guide their work should they 
be elected. Wilson noted how 
urging prospective members 
to set goals for the coming 
semester exposes them to the 
ideas and objectives of their 
fellow members, allowing for 
increased collaboration.

“(The candidates’ forum) 

really encourages the people 

running to think about what 
they’re going to be doing for 
the next year,” Wilson said. 
“If they end up winning, then 
they have this platform that 
they can look back on and 
really use that as a litmus test 
for what they should be doing 
and what they promised that 
they would do.”

During the forum, each of 

the 25 candidates spent three 
minutes presenting their plan 
for the coming semester before 
opening up to the audience for 
questions. LSA SG Appointed 
Representative 
Kaitlyn 

Colyer, an LSA freshman, said 
she hoped to tackle issues 
regarding financial aid and 
scholarships after receiving 
misinformation about the Go 
Blue Guarantee during her 
senior year of high school. 
Instituted in January 2018, 
the Go Blue Guarantee covers 
the full cost of tuition for 
Michigan 
residents 
with 

family incomes under $65,000 
a year.

“This year my theme is 

equity –– making sure all 
students have access to the 
resources on this campus,” 
Colyer said. “I was told by an 
admissions 
counselor 
that 

I would be guaranteed the 
Go Blue Guarantee and so I 
accepted my admissions offer 
as soon as I got the offer. 
Unfortunately, I am currently 
over $28,000 in debt. However, 
I know 30 students who are 
in the same boat and we are 
willing to make a change.”

Wilson said making the 

financial 
aid 
office 
more 

transparent, an issue touched 
upon by various candidates, is 
a major project LSA SG hopes 
to address because it would 
help alleviate the financial 
strain 
placed 
upon 
many 

students at the University.

“It’s part of the job of 

student government to hold 
the 
University 
accountable 

and make sure that those 
things 
actually 
happen,” 

Wilson said. “Having people 
that are aware of those issues 
heavily involved in student 

government, 
that’s 
really 

heartening for me.”

LSA 
SG 
Elected 

Representative 
Jordan 

Schuler, an LSA sophomore, 
proposed opening a “general 
learning center” that would 
provide basic information to 
students 
about 
test-taking 

strategies 
and 
anxiety 

management. 
Schuler, 
who 

served as the vice chair of the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
for the past year, said the 
center would help bridge the 
gap between high school and 
University coursework.

“This is definitely a long-

term project and something 
that might not be done by 
the time that I graduate, but 
I know that it could benefit 
so many students,” Schuler 
said. “I think that it’s really 
important to put in all the 
effort I can that while I’m 
here.”

would have further committed the 
city to its climate action policies.

“I think it will be following 

through with their stance,” Basile 
said. “Right now, people assume that 
because Ann Arbor is progressive in 
so many other ways that we assume 
their sustainability goals and their 
climate action programs, but they 
actually haven’t done much in terms 
of implementing their goals.”

The 
resolution 
has 
been 

controversial because of how the 
money was acquired. In November 
2017, Ann Arbor residents voted to in 
favor of a millage that allocated funds 
towards mental health facilities and 
public safety, though Council has 
reconsidered millage funds to go 
toward things like affordable housing 
and climate action which were 
not initially included in the ballot 
proposal passed by voters.

Carman said she understands the 

controversy but feels climate action is 
already underfunded in the city.

“On the one hand, I recognize 

that it’s complicated,” Carman said. 
“The source of the controversy is 
not that money is being taken away 
from mental health. It’s that there’s 
people who believe there should be 
additional funding for mental health. 
My feeling is that it’s not being taken 
away from mental health. It’s adding 
money that can go to something else.”

Ann 
Arbor 
Resident 
Ryan 

Hughes, who was defeated by City 
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 
1 during the 2018 election, questioned 
how the city will fund climate action, 
affordable housing and pedestrian 
safety without the revenues to do so.

“If millage money isn’t how we 

think these things should be funded, 
then well how do you intend to (fund 
these)?” Hughes said.

City 
Councilmember 
Anne 

Bannister, D-Ward 1, and City 
Councilmember Jack Eaton, D-Ward 
4, sponsored a resolution to fund a 
pilot program for net zero energy 
affordable 
housing 
and 
electric 

vehicle chargers. The resolution 
failed 6-5.

Eaton said climate action should 

not be addressed by creating new 
government entities.

“I really believe that we have as 

our core value the desire to address 
climate change and that it should not 
be accomplished through setting up a 
new bureaucracy and pouring money 
into a new department,” Eaton said.

Ackerman said the resolution does 

not create new bureaucracy in the 
city, but rather shares the city’s values 
with city employees.

“This isn’t establishing another 

bureaucracy because it’s as simple as 
making sure every single department 
at this city hall share our values and 
live those values at their 9-5 every 
single day,” Ackerman said.

Basile believes Bannister and 

Eaton want to address climate 
action in specific ways rather than 
holistically.

“The responses from Eaton and 

Bannister (seem like) ‘We like the 
plan but we don’t like where the 
funding is coming from,” Basile said. 
“Now, they’re saying ‘We like the plan 
but we’re gonna decide what parts to 
fund instead of taking it as a whole 
way to address these promises that 
we made.’”

Smith said the time to take action is 

critical due to the time period humans 
have to address climate change before 
damage is irreversible.

“I 
understand 
where 

Councilmember Eaton is coming 
from by saying it’s not critical,” Smith 
said. “I look at the United Nations’ 
International 
Climate 
Change 

Organization paper that came out 
that we have 12 years to turn this 
around. That seems pretty damn 
critical to me.”

Ann 
Arbor 
Resident 
Brian 

Chambers 
supported 
both 

amendments 
to 
the 
budget, 

specifically due to natural disasters 
throughout the nation that could 
cause migration north.

“We’ve 
got 
a 
good 
climate 

generally,” Chambers said. “Now it’s 
like ‘everyone knows’ and they’re 
gonna move here. Our challenge to 
sustainability as it ties to affordable 
housing is that they’re tied together.”

Council also voted to purchase four 

automated side loading refuse trucks 
and postponed a vote to authorize a 
lower town area mobility study and 
appropriate street funding.

Councilmember Kathy Griswold, 

D-Ward 
2, 
quoted 
a 
previous 

Michigan Daily article regarding 
a blind student’s experience using 
the crosswalk at the intersection 
of E. Madison and State Street. 
Commenting on the mobility study, 
Griswold critiqued the Council for 
what she says is inadequate use of 
data and public guidelines.

“We don’t use the data we have,” 

Griswold said. “We don’t follow 
federal and state guidelines and it 
troubles me that we would do yet 
another plan when we do not have 
crosswalk design guidelines and we 
do not have safe crosswalks.”

Gupta said. “Everyone in high

to explore an art form a lot of

DANCE 100: Introduction 

to Dance (87 percent)

With 15 different sections 

this 
past 
semester, 
the 

Introduction to Dance course 
provides 
lessons 
on 
the 

technical and creative aspects 
of a variety of genres in dance. 
Though many sections were 
available last semester, each 
term offers a new variety of 
genres, decided on by current 
Graduate Student Instructors 

in 
the 
department, 

according to Katie Gunning, 
administrative 
assistant 
in 

the Department of Dance.

“The Intro to Dance classes 

change each semester and 
are based off of our graduate 
students and what they want 
to 
offer,” 
Gunning 
said. 

“We always have intro-level 
modern and ballet classes 
available, but all the time 
we’re getting new intro-level 
classes and it’s because of 
the graduate student cohort 
that we have and what they 
are interested in and want to 
bring to the department.”

LSA freshman Alex Beaty 

said the unique style of her 
Introduction to Dance class 
gives her a break from her 
academic schedule.

“I think it’s interesting 

because a lot of people in 
the class don’t have a dance 
background 
and 
it’s 
an 

experience getting to be in 
a dance class where it’s not 
super serious and not super 
rigorous in any way,” Beaty 
said. “You’re all just doing it 
for fun and it’s like a break 
from normal classes.”

Korean culture while challenging 
ideas of femininity and female 
empowerment around the world.

Other 
performances 
featured 

individuals, such as Maleny Crespo, 
whose spoken-word performance 
and dance was an expression of 
their queer identity as a person of 
color. Other spoken-word pieces 
related gender identity to religion 
and emphasized the importance 
of recognizing vulnerability in 
masculinity.

Engineering junior Malika Taka 

said she appreciated the show 
because she felt it was different 
from what she is usually exposed 
to. In particular, she said she liked 

a spoken-word performance that 
discussed the tension between 
masculinity and queerness.

“I really liked the performance 

where (the performer) was non-
binary and talked about how 
even though (they appear) very 
masculine, but it’s not exactly what it 
looks like all the time,” Taka said. “I 
thought that one left an impression.” 

For 
Coterillo, 
she 
said 
her 

involvement in the show was 
meaningful because of the diverse 
audience.

“It felt very exhilarating … 

Getting to talk about the many 
 

facets of gender to people of 
different ages, of different parts of 
 

Michigan, I saw different family 
members … It was an absolute 
pleasure to be a part of this event,”

M

iichigan 
has 
long 
been considered a 
key part of the “blue 
wall,” a term used to describe 
the reliability of Democratic 
voters in the northern 
Midwest states. This 
is a nice sentiment 
but we in Michigan 
have 
a 
Republican 
governor (if for only 
two 
more 
months) 
and 
a 
Republican 
state 
legislature. 
So maybe the blue 
wall only works for 
nationwide elections 
— but then we went 
for Trump in the 2016 election, 
and 
the 
punditry 
became 
unusually 
obsessed 
with 
“working-class voters” (read: 
white working-class voters), 
with many people writing 
thinkpieces 
about 
Macomb 
County. 
The 
mainstream 
media was suddenly talking 
about Michigan, aiming to 
understand 
what 
exactly 
happened to make it switch 
from a state that supported 
former 
President 
Barack 
Obama 
to 
a 
state 
that 
supported President Donald 
Trump, and if that meant it 
should now be considered 
more purple-red than blue. 
Then, Nov. 7 happened, and 
we elected Democratic women 
to be governor, secretary of 
state and attorney general. We 
flipped two seats in the House 
of 
Representatives 
from 
red to blue (shoutout to my 
hometown, 11th congressional 
district and our new member 
of Congress, Haley Stevens!). 
We re-elected Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow, D-Mich., and we 
adopted 
three 
statewide 
proposals to legalize weed, 
end gerrymandering and enact 
automatic voter registration.
So now what are we? An icon 
of the resistance against the 
president we played a key role 
in electing? Which election 
was a fluke? Michigan voters 
have left me with so many 
questions about my own state. 

My intuition from growing up 
here, and from phone banking 
and canvassing for the 2016 
and 2018 elections, tells me 
that Michigan is neither blue 
nor red nor even 
purple. 
Michigan 
is a state of families 
and workers who 
will vote for who 
speaks 
to 
them 
and 
promises 
to 
advocate on behalf 
of their concerns, 
regardless of party. 
This might sound 
like the description 
of a purple state, 
but there is nothing random or 
flip-floppy about Michigan’s 
voting. One party may speak 
to Michiganders for a decade 
better than the other, then 
become complacent and the 
other party will step in and 
prioritize the state. Michigan 
voters 
are 
consistently 
focused on job creation and 
infrastructure. So it isn’t our 
priorities that change, but the 
messaging of the two major 
parties.
Democratic 
candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton 
famously 
ignored Michigan in the final 
days of the 2016 election — a 
move many saw as fatal not 
only for the state, but the 
country. On the other hand, 
Trump spent his final day on 
the campaign trail in Grand 
Rapids firing up voters to show 
up for him. This narrative 
isn’t meant to discount the 
harmful and sensationalist 
rhetoric of Trump’s campaign 
that surely invigorated some 
racists and sexists more than 
that last visit ever did. But 
while 
Trump 
was 
talking 
to said racists and sexists, 
Michigan’s people of color, 
working-class 
families 
and 
women 
were 
being 
overlooked.
But then came Democratic 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Gretchen Whitmer and so 
many other new faces in 
Michigan’s 
Democratic 

Party like Haley Stevens and 
Elissa Slotkin. They weren’t 
focusing on partisan drama 
or strategizing in a manner 
that abandoned any of their 
potential constituents. During 
the 
primaries, 
Gretchen 
committed to visiting every 
last 
county 
in 
Michigan, 
not writing any off as a 
guaranteed win or loss. This 
strategy paid off, earning her 
a very comfortable win in the 
primary and in the general 
election, and by pulling her 
state much further blue in the 
general.
So, what do we do in 2020? 
Thanks to Proposal 2, the 
uphill battle against intensely 
gerrymandered districts will 
(hopefully) be resolved at 
that point, making all votes 
count as they should in a 
democratic 
election. 
This 
development means a more 
equal playing field and thus 
greater room for expanding 
the 
Democratic 
Party’s 
voters. Therefore, Democrats 
should not write Michigan 
off as a win or loss, but send 
resources to the state and 
commit 
to 
communicating 
with Michiganders about the 
issues. Proposal 3 will have 
an effect on the election as 
well, presumably by helping 
Democrats, as the proposal 
adopted 
automatic 
voter 
registration 
in 
Michigan. 
I hope this will encourage 
Democrats 
to 
focus 
more 
on the youth vote, as every 
citizen 18 and older will be an 
eligible voter.
We should not take the 
midterm elections results as 
proof of a rebuilt blue wall, 
but rather as evidence that 
when Democratic candidates 
make an effort to appeal to 
and 
accurately 
represent 
Michiganders, they have a 
true chance at winning their 
support.

W

e’ve had a pretty 
rough 
couple 
of 
years 
in 
American 
politics. 
Having 
the opportunity to elect the 
first female president, and 
instead giving power to a 
sexist, 
racist, 
homophobic 
bigot was a tough start for 
a presidential turnover. But 
then we unsurprisingly saw 
a rise in hate crimes and 
ignorant 
policy 
changes, 
making 
life 
even 
more 
difficult for people of color, 
the LGBTQ community and 
women all over America. And 
to add insult to injury, that 
sexist 
president 
nominated 
a 
sexist 
Supreme 
Court 
justice, who will likely only 
exacerbate the hate crimes 
and ignorant policy changes. 
The past two years have been 
nothing but an orange stain on 
our honorable American flag, 
making it a difficult time to be 
a proud American. The reign 
of Trump has basically taken 
any progress made by the 
#MeToo movement, the Black 
Lives Matter movement and 
all other recent civil rights 
movements, and spit in their 
faces.
But this time we spit back. 
In a record turnout, Americans 
took up arms and went down 
to the polls — electing women, 
people of color and LGBTQ 
candidates 
in 
different 
positions all over the country. 
These midterm elections were 
not just a blue wave, or even a 
simply pink wave, but a wave of 
firsts that can start to reverse 
the damage of the past two 
years and take our country in 
the right direction. Women 
of different races, ethnicities, 
religions, 
sexualities 
and 
even political parties took 
the 
election 
by 
storm, 
putting a record number of 
women in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and giving a 
voice to many minority groups 
that have been overlooked in 
past elections. Overnight, a 
government run by old, upper-
class white men began to 

reflect a more accurate image 
of our nation. And these are 
some of the faces behind the 
firsts.
Democrats Cindy Axn and 
Abby Finkenauer were Iowa’s 
first women elected to the 
U.S. House. Janet Mills, a 
Democrat, became the first 
female governor of Maine. And 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez 
became the youngest woman 
ever elected to Congress, at 
age 29.
Many of the firsts even 
cross-cut 
intersectionality. 
Ayanna 
Pressley 
became 
Massachusetts’s 
first 
Black 
woman in Congress and Jahana 

Hayes became Connecticut’s 
first black woman in Congress. 
Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, 
is Arizona’s first woman in 
the U.S. Senate and the first 
openly bisexual person in the 
Senate.
We also have Deb Haaland 
of New Mexico and Sharice 
Davids of Kansas — America’s 
first Native American women 
in 
Congress. 
Davids 
also 
happens 
to 
be 
Kansas’s 
first openly gay member of 
Congress. Veronica Escobar 
and 
Sylvia 
Garcia 
became 
Texas’s first Latinx women in 
Congress. Ilhan Omar became 
America’s first Muslim women 
in Congress, along with our 
very own Rashida Tlaib, a 
Michigan Democrat who we 
just elected to the U.S. House. 
And these are only a few of the 
many firsts of the midterms.

This is not to say the 
midterms were all progress. 
Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, 
could have become the first 
Black governor of Florida, 
but 
was 
unable 
to 
defeat 
Republican 
Ron 
DeSantis. 
Likewise, Democrat Christine 
Hallquist did make history as 
the first transgender nominee 
of a major party, but lost 
Vermont’s gubernatorial race 
to Phil Scott, a Republican.
However, these unfortunate 
losses 
do 
not 
erase 
the 
impressive 
gains 
made 
by 
women in this midterm, and 
the effects will be unlike 
anything we’ve ever seen in 
American politics. This wave 
couldn’t have come at a better 
time. Flipping a previously 
red House restores the checks 
and balances system to the 
government. In the coming 
years, we can expect to see 
the 
Trump 
administration 
struggle to pass any major 
legislation. We can trust many 
of these new faces to be the 
wall in front of Trump’s wall 
between the U.S. and Mexico, 
a repeal of Obamacare, any tax 
cuts and defunding Planned 
Parenthood. With these new 
leaders of America, we can rest 
assured that we as a nation are 
on the road to representation.
It’s been a long time since 
I’ve been truly proud to be 
an American. For the past 
two years, my pride for my 
country 
has 
been 
tainted 
from the behaviors of those 
representing 
me 
and 
the 
discrimination 
and 
hatred 
against my fellow Americans, 
people of color, the LGBTQ 
community and women alike. 
While these midterms did not 
rid us of hatred or completely 
dissolve that stain, a little bit 
of justice has been restored a 
little bit of color is returning 
to the flag. And a little bit of 
my pride has come back as 
well.

O

ver 20,000 employees 
of Google from all 
over the world walked 
out of their offices on Nov. 1 
protesting the way in which 
the tech giant has dealt with 
claims of sexual harassment, 
gender 
inequality 
and 
systemic racism. The event 
happened in response to a 
New York Times article, which 
revealed that Google has been 
paying millions of dollars in 
exit packages to its executives 
accused of sexual harassment. 
This is not the first time 
Google’s 
employees 
have 
walked out in protest of the 
tech giant’s conduct, projects 
and policies. In the last few 
months, petitions have been 
signed, walk-outs have been 
organized and employees have 
resigned in protest of Google’s 
increasingly 
worrying 
projects, from working with 
the Pentagon to develop the 
future generation of military 
artificial 
intelligence, 
to 
secretly developing a censored 
search engine for China.
With every single scandal 
Google gets itself involved 
in, 
there 
is 
a 
worrisome 
pattern emerging: As Google 
is increasingly becoming less 
transparent, 
more 
profit-
focused and more forgetful 
about 
its 
founders’ 
motto 
“Don’t Be Evil,” employees 
are only finding out about the 
company’s projects and issues 
through 
leaks 
published 
by 
journalists. 
You 
could 
argue that this pattern is 
expected for a large company, 
whose only way of managing 
its 
employees 
is 
through 
increasingly 
bureaucratic 
measures. 
This 
argument, 
though, 
goes 
against 
the 
original 
nature 
of 
what 
technology was supposed to 
be.
From its very inception, 
Google’s 
main 
goal 
was 
“to 
organize 
the 
world’s 
information 
and 
make 
it 
universally 
accessible 
and 

useful.” This goal was very 
much 
aligned 
with 
the 
idealistic stances of hackers 
and technologists of the ’80s 
and ’90s: They saw technology 
as 
a 
way 
of 
demolishing 
bureaucracy, of giving each 
person a voice, of reclaiming 
knowledge 
from 
those 
in 
positions 
in 
power 
and 
distributing it equally to every 
citizen of our world.
When someone says Google, 
they most likely think about 
the 
abstract 
structure, 
generating 
profit 
and 
deploying projects. I think we 
have to start thinking about 
Google as a community of 
people: people who once had 
the idealistic perception on 
technology of the ’80s and 
’90s. These people nowadays 
are developing a censored 
search 
engine 
for 
China, 
despite 
having 
14 
human 
rights groups warning them 
about the inevitable human 
rights violations of developing 
this project. People deploying 
artificial intelligence systems 
to the military as a first step 
towards using this technology 
in advanced weapons. In this 
way, instead of blaming this 
abstract entity called Google, 
we can start asking ourselves 
who these people are.
Usually, they are us. Or me. 
Or any skilled graduate with a 
science degree, whose dream 
has been to work at Google 
and, from early on, pursued 
internships at the company. 
They are people who spend 
their undergrad taking the 
most 
challenging 
classes, 
developing their interviewing 
skills 
and 
going 
through 
textbooks filled with coding 
challenges. These are the 
people who are told that they 
will do well.
We are taught how to solve 
increasingly hard problems, 
we are taught how to enhance 
our 
LinkedIn 
profile 
by 
adding more numbers to our 
project descriptions, we are 

taught to regard the “cool” 
internships that we get as our 
badge of honor for all our hard 
work, but we are missing out 
on a huge chunk from what we 
are supposed to learn. What 
if the numbers that we added 
to our internship description 
were the number of humans 
that our product negatively 
affected? What if one of the 
challenging problems we had 
to solve was how a government 
can keep track of its citizens’ 
every move?
We are supposed to continue 
solving interesting problems 
without placing them above 
people’s needs. If we want 
our work to have a good 
impact, it has to abide by some 
ethical guidelines. Guidelines 
which aren’t even clear to 
philosophers 
of 
artificial 
intelligence ethics. We are 
supposed to balance hours and 
hours of coding, while also 
mindfully 
considering 
the 
consequences our code might 
have on others. Why do we not 
get any guidance in doing all 
of this?
Getting 
a 
degree 
in 
Computer Science is already 
challenging. So challenging 
that our curriculum, peers 
and 
mentors 
sometimes 
forget 
about 
the 
negative 
disruptive power of tech. They 
forget that what they call 
“developing 
leaders” 
could 
also mean developing leaders 
for 
an 
autocratic 
regime, 
leaders 
of 
companies 
that 
completely disregard human 
rights, leaders of start-ups 
that contribute to systemic 
inequality and discrimination. 
Just read more about Uber, 
Facebook and the like and 
you will see what I am talking 
about. So what kind of leaders 
do we want to develop? What 
kind of leaders do we want to 
become?

There is a certain kind of magic 

that happens when women’s voices 
fuse together — it’s always spiritual 
even if the listener isn’t, a joyful 
noise made unto the congregation 
no matter what the circumstances. 
While I wouldn’t call the collection 
of people at The Majestic Theatre 
on Sunday a church, with their 
nose rings and shearling jackets 
and 
well-worn 
band 
t-shirts, 

we were all there to have some 
experience of beauty, and that we 
definitely got. The three artists that 
form boygenius — Phoebe Bridgers, 
Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker — all 
took the stage with equal power, 
their voices ringing through the 
audience alone and then together. 
Though it was dark and crowded in 
the venue, with the fans whirring 
and heat blasting, the moments 
that hung in the air throughout 
each artist’s set were worth our 
heavy breath. The neon signs on 
the walls glowed in the darkness, 
but they could have easily been 
stained glass. Purity and soul were 
woven into every melody like a 
hymn, a naked baring of all three 
souls through the stories of their 
lives.

The first artist to play was Lucy 

Dacus, a quiet brunette whose 
underlying power as a musician 
may not seem obvious at first, but 
makes sense as soon as she opens 
her mouth. Dacus was technically 
the opener, but her shorter set left 
the audience satisfied — each one 
of her songs sprawls across five or 
six minutes at least, constantly in 
flux between different movements. 
On 
songs 
like 
“Night 
Shift” 

and “I Don’t Want to Be Funny 
Anymore,” those that put her on 
the map of indie rock, Dacus’s 
raw soul came through in every 
note. The audience hung onto 
every lyric exiting her painted-
red lips, jumping and whooping as 
each song came to its climax in a 
thumping crescendo of guitar and 
drums. The songwriter’s truest 
talent is hidden beneath her low 
and smooth voice, but emerges 
when the crowd gets loud; she’s 

a secret rock star, one of a new 
generation that is bringing soul 
back into the genre with honest 
narratives of love and loss.

As Dacus left the stage to huge 

applause, the audience waited 
for the next chanteuse to appear. 
The crowd buzzed excitedly as 
the mic was draped in fairy lights, 
a signature set piece of Phoebe 
Bridgers that only added to the 
cozy mood of the show. Bridgers 
stepped into the light with an 
almost alien beauty, her silvery 
platinum hair held back by a black 
headband and cascading down her 
shoulders. The concert’s feel was 
never funerary despite the black 
outfits of all three artists; instead, it 
was merely a blank canvas for their 
voices to stretch over like paint, as 
the audience’s attention was drawn 
only to their faces, contorted 
and smiling through each song. 
Bridgers’s performance of her debut 
LP Stranger in the Alps was truly 
something to be reckoned with. 
Her live skills mirror the beauty of 
her studio work almost exactly, the 
only differences found in the grand 
scale of her stage presence. A cover 
of Gillian Welch’s “Everything is 
Free” performed with drummer 
Marshall Vore punctuated her set 
with a melancholy note, supporting 
her original songs with the wistful 
words of the past. The Majestic 
holds over 600 people, but it felt like 
she was singing directly to every 
audience member as a personal 
conversation, mulling over her 
own life with ease and the class of 
an artist beyond her years.

Julien Baker then closed out the 

solo sets of the show with a bang, a 
Telecaster and a whole lotta soul. 
Seeing Baker live feels like you’re at 
a magic show — it’s hard to believe 
such a big sound can come out of 
such an unassuming and petite 
person, but this illusion didn’t last 
for long. As soon as she walked up 
to the mic, the crowd would have 
been stupid to think something big 
wasn’t about to happen. Even her 
small stature and general shyness 
on stage can’t hide the stage 
presence that Baker carries with 
her everywhere, a diamond beneath 
long blonde-brown hair and her 
understated 
banter 
between 

songs. She began with the song 

that made her a household name, 
“Sprained Ankle,” immediately 
proving herself to the crowd as a 
powerhouse and riding that wave 
through a succession of similarly 
perfect tunes. Baker’s melodies 
are high and moving, accompanied 
by a performance of thrown-back 
heads and interjecting shouts that 
let the audience know how much 
she really loves making her music. 
The passion that all three artists 
have for their work was palpable 
throughout the entire four-hour 
set, making the long-haul stand 
worth every ache of the morning 
after.

The three solo sets of the night 

were stunning, but the real magic 
of last Sunday lay when Baker, 
Bridgers and Dacus joined together 
to perform their EP as boygenius. It 
honestly seems like they were born 
to play music with one another, like 
siblings or sirens waiting in the 
water. Their allure is most obvious 
in the measured vulnerability of 
each member’s decisions to shine 
or support — all of them are stars 
alone, but their respect for each 
other leads to a cohesive group 
that allows everyone to soar 
and simmer in different ways. 
Bridgers’s stunning belt on “Me 
and My Dog” was countered by her 
quiet harmonies on “Souvenir,” and 
the same goes for both Baker and 
Dacus on other tracks. Watching 
the three interact on stage was like 
looking onto a family telling stories 
after dinner, as they shared in their 
musical similarities and differences 
to create a woven quilt of soft folk, 
anthemic rock and a pointed clarity 
that only comes from groups with 
natural chemistry. The last song of 
the show was an acoustic version 
of “Ketchum, ID” that took the 
crowd’s breath away in an instant 
 

— boygenius decided to go without 
microphones and instead asked the 
audience to join them in singing 
along, which resulted in one of the 
most moving concert experiences 
I’ve ever had. The harmonies of 
the crowd became a dysfunctional 
choir for a moment, as hundreds of 
voices rose to meet the group in the 
middle. It was almost as if we were 
praying together, celebrating music 
in the way that only those who 
really love it can do.

Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus supergroup 
turned The Majestic Theatre into a sacred space on Sunday

‘Princess Switch’ spins the 
lookalike formula for Xmas

’Tis the season for sugar-

cookie feasting, family feuds, 
frostbite and, of course, romantic 

holiday flicks. Would it really be 
the most wonderful time of the 
year without these old-reliable, 
quintessential 
hallmark-esque 

gems? Sure, the classics are great, 
but there is something especially 
comforting in settling in for 

an hour and a half to witness 
the magic of an unrealistic 
yet pure love story unfolding 
right before your eyes. Though 
underwhelming in originality, 
riddled 
with 
cringe-worthy, 

PG-rated 
romantic 
tension 

SAMANTHA NELSON

Daily Arts Writer

and 
oozing 
with 
Christmas 

spirit, “The Princess Switch” 
is unexpectedly charming and 
ultimately successful in warming 
our hearts. 

With 
Christmas 
fast 

approaching, 
hardworking, 

talented and no-nonsense baker 
Stacy (Vanessa Hudgens, “High 
School Musical”) has business 
on her mind. However, when 
her handsome, easy-going best 
pal Kevin (Nick Sagar, “Ill 
Manors”) reveals that she has 
been accepted into a prestigious 
baking competition, which he 
secretly entered her into months 
before, Stacy’s holiday plans take 
an unanticipated toll. Persuaded 
by Kevin and his charismatic 
and uber-cute daughter Olivia, 
played 
by 
newcomer 
Alexa 

Adeosun, 
Stacy 
soon 
finds 

herself en route from Chicago to 
the royal kingdom of Belgravia to 
put her cooking skills on display. 
Shortly after her arrival, Stacy 
finds herself face to face with yet 
another surprise: Margaret (also 
played by Vanessa Hudgens), the 
Duchess of Montenaro and her 
literal double. When Margaret, 
eager for a taste of the world as 
a commoner before she weds the 
Prince of Belgravia, asks Stacy 
to swap lives for two days, Stacy 
hesitantly 
agrees. 
However, 

as is expected, love gets in the 
way of the girls’ plan and things 
become, well, complicated.

“The Princess Switch” can be 

best described as “The Holiday” 
meets “Monte Carlo,” a mashup 
that we probably didn’t need 
an entire movie to picture, 
but is enjoyable nonetheless. 

An 
undeniably 
“seasonal” 

film, much of its charm would 
arguably be subdued were it to 
be re-watched in August. The 
movie’s greatest shortcoming, 
however, is that instead of 
developing 
the 
chemistry 

between 
the 
characters 

onscreen, director Mike Rohl 
(“Kyle XY”) crosses his fingers 
that the age-old wonder of the 
fast-track-romance-with-a-
stranger plotline will be enough 
to make the budding romances 
believable. 

At its very core, “The Princess 

Switch” is completely and totally 
wholesome, a movie that should 
be accompanied by a mug of 
marshmallow-laden, 
whipped-

cream-topped hot chocolate and 

a platter of gingerbread cookies. 
While both protagonists are 
incredibly cookie-cutter, with 
Margaret tied down by duty and 
seeking adventure and freedom, 
and Stacy, who is uptight, goal-
oriented and detests surprises 
for 
some 
reason, 
we 
don’t 

seem to mind. Whether it’s 
the mouthwatering displays of 
immaculately fashioned cakes 
and pastries, courtesy of the 
scenes used to exemplify Stacy’s 
superb baking skills, or the 
cheesy 
horseback-riding 
and 

Christmas-shopping dates, there 
is something about the film that 
allows us to ignore its flaws and 
bask in the gleeful combination 
of 
happily-ever-after 
and 

season’s greetings.

With an open mind, managed 

expectations 
and 
a 
bit 
of 

Christmas spirit — instead of 
analyzing 
the 
seen-it-before, 

fairytale 
plotline 
and 
Stacy 

and Margaret’s respective one-
dimensional male suitors — we 
can focus instead on Vanessa 
Hudgens’s 
impeccable 
glow 

and allow ourselves to slip into 
the holiday mood. If you don’t 
feel quite hyped enough for the 
upcoming 
winter 
festivities 

or just need a little pre-finals 
season pick me up, this will likely 
do the trick. 

FILM REVIEW

“The Princess 

Switch”

Netflix

At 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 

this past Sunday, a group of 
diverse and inspiring women 
transported the city of Ann 
Arbor to a rare and beautiful 
place. Every space was a woman’s 
space at the Hello Sunshine X 
Together Live event.

Together Live is a traveling 

storytelling 
organization 

that 
partnered 
with 
Reese 

Witherspoon’s 
media 
brand, 

Hello 
Sunshine, 
to 
bring 

authentic storytelling to spaces 
worldwide in order to help 
amplify diverse and inclusive 
female voices. Among the voices 
heard at Sunday’s event were 
comedian 
Cameron 
Esposito, 

soccer player Abby Wambach, 
journalist Noor Tagouri and 
Together 
Live 
co-founders 

Glennon Doyle and Jennifer 
Rudolph Walsh. These women, 
and many other well-known 
feminists, are traveling to cities 
around the U.S. and splitting 
their hearts open — telling 
vulnerable stories of love, loss 
and their authentic journeys 
navigating 
the 
world. 
The 

women at Sunday’s event handed 
each of us a magnifying glass 
that allowed us to look into both 
their lives and our own. 

An 
immediate 
observation 

upon my entrance into the 
theater was that the audience 
was mostly women. This for me 
is always super empowering; but 
lately, I’ve been wondering why 
spaces created to amplify women 
can’t attract more men. I wonder 
if they feel excluded themselves. 
Or maybe they feel as though 
they do not need to be informed 
about this community and don’t 
think twice about attending a 
women’s empowerment event at 
all. 

Patriarchal systems dominate 

in all spheres of American 
life, 
including 
business, 

entertainment 
and 
media, 

and we all need to hear the 
unfiltered 
and 
empowering 

stories of women, regardless of 
who we are. There’s something 
so important and so rare about 
men genuinely looking to hear 
these 
female 
empowerment 

stories. Despite my love for the 
girl-power sentiment filling the 
theater, I wished for more male 
desire to learn from the event 
in order to be an allied force 
to the women’s empowerment 
and 
rights 
movement 
going 

forward. An important piece to 
the women’s rights movement is 
informed listening from those 
who have the power in exclusive 
spaces in order to help keep the 
door open for those of us trying 
to get through. 

Kicking off the evening of 

girl 
power 
storytelling 
was 

vocalist and songwriter MILCK, 
whose 
brassy, 
clear 
voice 

established the evening as a 
warm, welcoming and, most of 
all, interactive space. The stage 
was set up like a boho-chic living 
room, which gave the impression 
of 
a 
private 
conversation 

between the women on stage and 
the entire, quieted audience. As 
MILCK’s voice bounced off the 
walls, everyone looked on with 
admiration. It was an emotional 
moment as she sang: “Ooh-ooh 
child / things are gonna get 
easier / Ooh-ooh child / things’ll 
get brighter / Ooh-ooh child / 
things’ll get brighter.” Halfway 
through her opening song, she 
took a pause to look at everyone 
in the audience and speak to us 
directly. 

“Ann Arbor … is gorgeous,” 

MILCK 
said 
before 
picking 

back up with her song. With her 
compliment to our precious little 
city, we all swelled with pride, 
even more excited for what the 
rest of the evening entailed. 

Jennifer 
Rudolph 
Walsh 

(Together Live Co-Founder) took 
over as the crowd cheered and 
whistled for MILCK and the rest 
of the guests flooded the stage. 

“We are using the power 

of 
authentic 
storytelling 
to 

transform ourselves and the 
world around us,” Walsh said, 
which brought about a roar of 
applause from the audience. 
“Loneliness. 
Anxiety. 
Rage. 

Addiction. Depression. The cure 
... The antidote to all of this is 
storytelling. Especially in the 
disconnected times we’re living 
in.” 

I 
had 
the 
pleasure 
of 

interviewing 
Rudolph 
Walsh 

prior to the event and was 
thrilled to directly speak to her 
about something as important 
and life-changing as storytelling.

“Storytelling is our magic 

superpower. It connects, elevates 
and heals us. It’s a salve to bring 
us together during these divided 
times,” Walsh said when asked 
why she felt inclined to turn 
storytelling into her full-time 
job. 

During 
the 
event, 
Priya 

Parker, the founder of “Thrive 
Labs,” also shared some beautiful 
words about the importance 
of storytelling and gathering 
together as a community. 

“There’s an element of heat, 

risk and intimacy when we 
gather together to tell stories,” 
Parker said.

This really resonates, because 

I 
feel 
that 
when 
students 

who 
come 
from 
different 

backgrounds and have diverging 
opinions gather together to talk 
about something that makes us 
uncomfortable, we can make real 
breakthroughs. 

Abby Wambach, a professional 

soccer player, shared a bit about 

her own personal breakthrough, 
which I haven’t stopped thinking 
about since. 

“We all know the story of Red 

Riding Hood, right?” Wambach 
asked the audience, who nodded 
in agreement. “Well, Red Riding 
Hood is told to stay on the path 
or else the big bad wolf will get 
her. She’s told stay on the path 
and only on the path. But I’ve 
sort of found in my life that when 
I’m off the path, is when the 
best opportunities and moments 
come my way. So my mantra is 
to go off the path, and I sort of 
had to look at myself and say ‘Oh 
Abby, you weren’t Red Riding 
Hood. You were the wolf all 
along.’”

With that, a rush of energy 

filled the theater and suddenly 
we were all on our feet, yelling 
and cheering with enthusiasm 
and a new mantra: Be the wolf. 
As the evening progressed, I felt 
as though I was at a TED Talk — 
but subtract any morsel of toxic 
masculinity and add the most 
kickass, incredible women I had 
ever been in the presence of. 

“I think a lot of people think 

gays and minorities and liberals 
only live on the coasts but all 
I have to say is that we are 
everywhere. We are your fucking 
neighbors. We are HERE, ” said 
comedian 
Cameron 
Esposito 

following her stand-up set.

We are here. So many voices 

are ready to be heard.

When I asked Rudolph Walsh 

what she hoped people take away 
from the event, she said, “That 
everyone has a story and that it 
matters!” Gathering up stories 
and inhaling their themes and 
messages is the most incredible 
way to mend wounds, part 
seas and bring even the most 
diverging 
opinions 
together. 

What Rudolph Wash is seeking 
to do through Together Live X 
Hello Sunshine is something that 
should not only be celebrated 
but replicated, worldwide, by 
everyone — not just women.

I wanted to go and use my 

voice too. I wanted to listen. 
I wanted to stop strangers on 
the street and tell them stories. 
I wanted to hear theirs too. 
Two words that are part of the 
Together Live X Hello Sunshine 
mantra were etched into my 
head: Stories travel. 

Stories do travel. They travel 

from coast to coast. Across the 
world. Across your dorm room 
hallway, next door to your 
neighbors, all the way to the city 
you were born. Stories travel 
great lengths and distances, 
across time and space. They 
traveled to Ann Arbor. I put the 
ones I heard in my pocket as the 
shiny tools of the work yet to be 
done. And what a joy it is to know 
we’ll always have stories, they 
will never go out of style. They 
will never run out.

They were “there” in high 

school, but only in theory. 
While you wanted one — so you 
could, you know, say you had 
one — your 16-year-old body 
operated with the impenetrable 
inner mechanisms of a stallion 
and you went for a run the next 
day and then sat in a classroom 
from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
the next day, because, again, 
stallion body.

They’re here now. Hangovers 

are death that comes with 
an intangible cloudiness, a 
tidal wave of nothingness and 
everythingness that converges 
into silenced internal chaos, 
plucking at the functioning 
parts of you that remain and 
making sure any shard of 
productivity turns into mush 
(until the mush mushes slowly 
toward the next episode of 
“The Haunting of Hill House”).

Hall of Fame Pittsburgh 

Pirate Willie Stargell once said 
that getting a hit off of Hall 
of Fame Los Angeles Dodger 
Sandy Koufax was “like trying 
to eat soup with a fork.”

Nursing a hangover when 

you’re 
not 
a 
super 
young 

person feels like eating soup 
with a fork, except the soup 
is definitely of a Matzah Ball 
variety, injecting its rocket-
high salt content into the 
frayed and dehydrated shell of 
human that’s somehow still in 
there somewhere.

Really, I think I’ve come to 

accept hangovers for what they 
are: warning signs that arrive 
and linger with a familiar 
banality of doom. They hit 
everyone 
differently; 
rather 

than a more enjoyable straw-
drawing 
or 
Tap 
Roulette. 

Leaving this up to chance 
doesn’t translate to nervous 

excitement as much as the 
harsh 
reality 
that 
strikes 

between sips: Someone will 
be holed up for many hours 
tomorrow, someone else will 
see weird dots out of the corner 
of their eye for some reason and 
omelettes that might not, um, 
settle.

Is that just me? Maybe that’s 

me. All three things definitely 
happened, all at the same time, 
to me, this morning.

We then search for the cure, 

or things to proactively do 
before drinking. I don’t know 
if these solutions exist. I’m 
beginning to doubt they do.

Pedialyte 
first 
comes 
to 

mind. The friend who initially 
recommended this allegedly 
magic mix became a drinking 
buddy demigod with its early 
success. The company behind 
the stuff — which was intended 
to be hydration fluid for sick 
children — soon recognized its 
exploding market and adjusted 
accordingly, 
leading 
to 

Costco-sized Pedialyte boxes 
appearing in college residences 
across the country. But the 
body ultimately adapted to 
kiddie 
potion. 
Your 
friend 

became less cool, and your 
hangovers became way less 
manageable.

A Google search for hangover 

cures reveals the following tips: 
Limit your alcohol intake (OK), 
avoid drinks with congeners 
(don’t know what “congeners” 
means), eat a good breakfast 
(doesn’t 
work), 
get 
plenty 

of 
sleep 
(unrealistic), 
stay 

hydrated (I do!), have a drink 
the next morning (seems like 
bad advice but it gives me an 
excuse to reference my favorite 
scene in “The Shining”) or take 
supplements like red ginseng or 
prickly pear (Oh! Well I guess 
I need to try that one.). These 
“fixes” are all disqualified, 
however, because I declare that 
none of them work, and maybe 
I want to keep wallowing here 
anyway.

Yes, 
that’s 
it. 
We 
can 

keep wallowing. Our worst 
nightmare 
is 
confirmed 
— 

hangovers 
know 
no 
defeat 

— but just as Willie Stargell 
remained 
steadfast 
in 
his 

attempt to eat soup with a fork, 
we should also stay the course, 
because there’s a day after this 
one that won’t feel like booty, 
and I consider that a silver 
lining.

I’m 
not 
thankful 
for 

hangovers this year, but I am 
thankful for how they make 
me feel, because I’ve learned to 
embrace the wallow. It seems to 
be the (most) correct antidote 
for a permeating poison that 
can only be described with 
“ugh,” “yeesh” or an otherwise 
unintelligible mumble. When 
the bother does in fact arrive, 
I won’t have dispensed any 
applicable health or wellness 
advice to apply, but that might 
be OK, because the hangover 
probably 
incapacitates 
you 

from reading words in the first 
place. Godspeed, mush people.

For your consideration:

SCHUMAN

Chuck Lorre is not the type 

of guy you would expect to go 
off method. Deemed the “King 
of Sitcoms,” Lorre has risen 
to 
popularity 
under 
widely 

popular, 
three-camera 
laugh 

track 
productions 
including 

“Two and a Half Men,” “The Big 
Bang Theory” and “Mom.” His 
technique has worked so well, it’s 
a wonder why he would ever stray 
from the course. Yet in Lorre’s 
new 30-minute Netflix sitcom, 
“The Kominsky Method,” he does 
just that.

“The 
Kominsky 
Method” 

follows the hypermasculine yet 
endearing friendship of washed-
up acting coach Sandy Kominsky 
(Michael Douglas, “Ant Man and 
the Wasp”) and his blasé agent 
Norman (Alan Arkin, “Going in 
Style”). Shot in single-camera 
fashion with a lack of blinding 
lighting and laugh tracks, the 
show immediately distinguishes 
itself from Lorre’s usual MO. 
In one of the first interactions 
between Sandy and Norman, 
Sandy asks his friend and agent 
about landing an acting job on a 
sitcom.

“Those little pischers on ‘The 

Big Bang Theory,’ they’re making a 
million bucks a week!” Sandy tells 
Norman. “Sandy, it’s pabulum; 
it’s crap. You’re a world-famous 
acting coach. What’s it gonna look 
like, you doing a network sitcom?” 
Norman responds. It’s a moment 

that could appear to just be an old 
man trying to help his struggling 
friend realize his worth. But then: 
“So I didn’t get the part,” Sandy 
says. “No,” Norman answers. In 
a funny little reference to Lorre’s 
other work, this exchange sets 
the dynamic for the remainder 
of the show: two old men who 
will complain endlessly about 
the world around them while 

desperately longing to be a 
functional, meaningful part of it.

This idea of duality is one 

that sews a common thread 
between every scene of “The 
Kominsky Method.” The show’s 
first two episodes center around 
the death of Norman’s fiery 
wife 
Eileen 
(Susan 
Sullivan, 

“Castle”). 
It’s 
heartbreaking 

— a clearly crushing blow to 
Norman who, unlike his three-
time divorcee friend Sandy, has 
been with his wife for decades. 
Despite the tragedy, Eileen’s 
funeral is a celebration of fun and 
comedy MC’ed by Jay Leno and 
boasting performances of “Lady 
Marmalade” from Patti LaBelle 
and “The Way We Were” from 
a drag queen dressed as Barbra 
Streisand.

These incredible moments in 

“The Kominsky Method” make 
the lackluster ones even more 
disappointing. This is Lorre’s first 

venture into the “sadcom” realm, 
and the rookie mistakes are 
evident. Douglas and Arkin deliver 
exceptional performances as men 
dealing with all of the drama 
of aging, and their chemistry is 
contagious. Yet so often the show 
gets lost in the bond between 
these two men that it borders 
on the crime of self-obsession. 
“The Kominsky Method” focuses 
a bizarre amount on Sandy’s 
prostate problems, a truly normal 
issue for men of his age, but uses 
Norman’s daughter Phoebe (Lisa 
Edelstein, “The Good Doctor”) 
and her struggle with addiction 
as a punchline.

“The Kominsky Method” has 

room to improve, but at its core 
the show is funny, touching and 
a welcome and much-needed 
departure from such “pabulum” 
shows as “The Big Bang Theory.” 
Most of the show’s viewers are 
probably not newly widowed 
men or has-been acting coaches, 
but “The Kominsky Method” is 
crafted in such a way that this 
doesn’t matter. The trials and 
tribulations of being human is 
something everyone can relate to. 
As Norman says, “It hurts being 
human. It hurts like hell. And all 
the exploring in the world doesn’t 
make that hurt go away because 
being human and being hurt 
are the same damn thing.” This 
may be so, but “The Kominsky 
Method” shows viewers all they 
need is a friend going through the 
same hurt as them — one to tease 
and yell at and laugh with, and 
just maybe that hurt will go away.

‘The Kominsky Method’ is 
a jumbled portrait of aging

Method”

ALBUM REVIEW

In a world dominated by 

social media and the invention 
of new career paths, like being 
a YouTuber, the extent to which 
people share details of their 
lives online has skyrocketed. 
Netflix’s newest release “Cam” 
explores the disastrous effects 
of 
maintaining 
a 
popular 

online presence and the lack 
of authenticity that sites like 
Instagram and Snapchat have 
injected into our daily lives. 

“Cam” follows the life of Alice 

Ackerman (Madeline Brewer, 
“Orange is the New Black”) 
while she works to make it as 
a camgirl only to soon discover 
that someone, or something, has 
taken over her channel. With the 
fictional live-streaming site’s 
eerie similarity to YouTube and 
Alice’s career essentially that of 
a YouTuber, the film is able to 
highlight the more questionable 
practices 
prevalent 
in 
the 

online 
streaming 
platform. 

Alice spends days at a time 
coming up with new “shows,” 
and collaborations are often 
a way of gaining new fans. 
Views are directly related to 
how much money Alice makes 
and the company that runs 
the site takes a sizable chunk 
of the earnings away from its 
creators. Only the fact that 
Alice showcases and sexualizes 
her body instead of her makeup 
or DIY skills differentiates what 
she does as a sex worker from 
that of YouTubers like James 
Charles or LaurDIY. 

“Cam” 
also 
forces 
the 

audience 
to 
reconsider 

prejudices 
against 
people 

making 
a 
living 
in 

unconventional ways. The old 
joke of becoming a stripper 
becomes less of a joke and 
more of a reality as people 
realize the kind of money that 

a good stripper can make and 
the kinds of skills that are 
required to work in that kind 
of trade. Again, the same thing 
occurs with Instagram models 
and YouTubers — the amount 
of work it takes to curate and 
develop a successful following 
on either of these platforms is a 
marketing marvel. 

Social media comes with its 

downfalls, though, and “Cam” 

doesn’t ignore them. The lack of 
authenticity that we’re all guilty 
of when it comes to posting 
on Instagram and Snapchat is 
casually noted when Alice is 
shown simply scrolling through 
a series of pre-taken photos 
to satisfy one of her “guys.” 
The sticking point of the film 
— when Alice’s strange twin 
who took over her account — is 
a harsh reminder of society’s 
fickle attention span and Abby 
Lee Miller’s famous words: 
“Everyone is replaceable.” 

Each moment spent watching 

Alice at work is awash in neon 
pinks and soft, flattering light 
that makes whatever she does 
as a camgirl seem like a dream. 
Even as her livestream ends, 
the same kind of hazy quality 
permeates 
throughout 
the 

house that she bought using 
money from being a camgirl. 
Only when she’s forced to leave 
her place of work and confront 
the 
real 
world 
does 
this 

dreamlike state end. The scenes 
become dull and are no longer 
pastel; where her camgirl life 
is awash in blues and pinks, the 
real world is a rough mixture of 
greens and greys. It’s where her 
mother calls her out for biting 
her nails instead of her fans 
showering her with love and 
online tokens, akin to likes on a 
YouTube video or an Instagram 

photo. This juxtaposition of 
color schemes between scenes 
showing Alice’s reality and her 
career as a camgirl is reflective 
of the allure of becoming an 
internet personality and, in 
truth, the curated nature of the 
Instagram profile or Snapchat 
story. 

The 
movie’s 
social 

commentary, 
though, 
is 

overshadowed by its confusing 
plot that never actually answers 
some of the questions it poses. 
It suggests murder, stalkers and 
a strange entity that copies the 
profiles and styles of a popular 
girl’s site. The first two are 
standard thriller concepts but 
it’s the idea of some kind of 
virus or computer program 
that is preying on and taking 
advantage of girls online that 
leaves something to be desired. 
Given the amount of effort sites 
like Twitter and Instagram put 
into detecting fake accounts, 
this seems to be a bit far-fetched. 
The only realistic thing about 
the situation is that Alice never 
actually defeats it, but instead 
is just determined to avoid the 
same thing from happening 
again. More confusing still, 
though, is Netflix’s inability 
to tactfully handle triggering 
topics like suicide. The film 
shows Alice using it as a 
gimmick to gain views and 
money. The movie glorifies and 
sexualizes something that has 
had detrimental effects on the 
lives of many. 

The 
balance 
between 

individuality and popularity is 
a science that many influencers 
strive to perfect and “Cam” 
details this desire in a jarring 
manner by using a camgirl as 
the influencer in question. It’s 
a unique and thrilling movie, 
but the lack of understanding 
behind the plot and mental 
health 
make 
it 
about 
as 

authentic as a Kylie Jenner 
Snapchat story.

Lockwood, captains trying to lead Michigan to defensive consistency

It hasn’t always been pretty 
on defense for the No. 14 
Michigan hockey team.
Some games, the defense 
excels and the offense grinds 
— like in the Nov. 9 game 
against No. 7 Notre Dame, 
which 
the 
Wolverines 
won 
2-1. Two goals scored doesn’t 
sound like a stellar offensive 
performance, but the Fighting 
Irish rank seventh in the nation 
in defense, allowing an average 
of 1.92 goals per game.
In other games, the offense 
breaks through and the defense 
has difficulty. But lately, the 
offense has been more and more 
consistent, while the defense is 
still struggling to settle in and 
perform at the same level every 
night. 
This 
past 
weekend’s 
series against No. 5 Penn State 
exemplified that.
The offense was undeniably 
important — it isn’t just about 
the defensive struggles. Without 
its talented forwards, Michigan 
may not have been able to come 
back from a two-goal, third-
period deficit — twice — over 
the course of the weekend. 
While 
Saturday, 
the 
game 
ended with a loss in overtime, 
the resilience and confidence 
of the offense 
was key for the 
comeback.
“I think we’ve 
gotta have that 
confidence,” said 
junior 
forward 
Will Lockwood. 
“I 
think 
it’s 
good 
because 
we know we can 
play with anyone 
now, which is 
important, but I think we have 
to be more consistent. I think 
that’s gotta be the message 
throughout the locker room is 
consistency.”

After two comebacks late in 
games, the Wolverines have 
enough confidence. They have 
plenty of players who can score 
and the offense 
is 
finding 
a 
rhythm.
Now, it’s time 
for the defense 
to find the same 
consistency and 
put all the pieces 
together for a 
complete team.
“We 
just 
have 
to 
get 
everybody 
on 
the same page and we have to 
make a commitment to team 
defense,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “Once we do that, 
we’ll be even better. Otherwise, 

we’re just gonna be inconsistent 
like we are.”
And it’s up to Lockwood and 
his fellow letter-wearers — 
senior 
captain 
defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi 
along 
with 
alternate 
captains 
junior 
forward 
Jake 
Slaker, 
junior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin 
and 
senior 
defenseman 
Nick Boka — to 
help the team find a rhythm in 
all phases of the game.
“I 
think 
it 
starts 
by 
leadership,” 
Lockwood 
said. 
“(Pearson’s) been preaching it a 

little bit now, but I think now it’s 
gotta be up to myself and some 
other guys in the locker room 
to really get the guys going. 
That’s 
gotta 
be 
a 
platform 
for our game is 
(playing) 
with 
that energy all 
the time, not just 
a portion of the 
game.”
With a team 
that’s the fifth-
youngest 
in 
college 
hockey, 
leadership from 
the top down is important. It’s 
hard — especially at first — for 
the freshmen to feel comfortable 
stepping up and taking on an 
unofficial leadership role.

“I think we have some vocal 
leaders on the team,” Lockwood 
said. “I think those are the guys 
that are wearing the letters, 
but I don’t think 
guys should be 
shy who aren’t 
wearing 
letters 
to be vocal in 
the locker room. 
I think we have 
guys that lead 
by 
example 
and who aren’t 
specific leaders 
as far as letters 
go on the team, 
which is a great thing to see.”
Developing 
leaders 
is 
a 
slow process, but it seems 
that Lockwood and his fellow 
upperclassmen are ready and 

willing to encourage everyone 
on the team — not just those 
officially 
designated 
to 
be 
captains — to step up and take 
ownership.
As part of his responsibility as 
an alternate captain, Lockwood 
took advantage of a moment 
to lead by example against the 
Nittany Lions. Late in Friday’s 
game, the Wolverines had a 
5-4 lead, but Penn State had 
just pulled their goaltender to 
get an extra attacker and try 
to tie the game. But Lockwood 
managed to steal the puck 
from an opposing forward, and 
suddenly he was mere feet from 
a wide-open net. 
Rather than shoot the puck 
himself, he looked over his 
shoulder to find Slaker skating 
down the ice just behind him. 
He slipped the puck to his 
teammate, who tapped it home 
for his second goal of the night. 
It was selfless, pure and simple.
“I’ve played with Jake a lot, 
and I think he would do the 
same thing for me,” Lockwood 
said. “I think it was more of just 
setting an example of how we 
need to play as a team. We’ve 
gotta be thinking of the guy next 
to us and not just ourselves.”
Leadership 
won’t 
always 
come in obvious moments like 
that. Sometimes it’s the little 
things, 
like 
keeping 
your 
teammates fired 
up in the locker 
room 
when 
you’re facing a 
deficit or skating 
just a little bit 
harder toward a 
loose puck.
But 
maybe, 
just maybe, as 
the 
leadership 
from the captains trickles down 
through the rest of the team, 
Michigan will finally find the 
consistency on defense it’s been 
looking for all season.

EMMA RICHTER/Daily
Junior forward Will Lockwood believes his team knows it “can play with anyone,” after the Wolverines split their series with Penn State last weekend.

‘M’ to host Wildcats, Spartans as Tourney looms

Mark 
your 
calendar 
for 
Sunday, Nov. 25 — the 2018 
NCAA 
Division 
I 
women’s 
volleyball selection show. The 
tournament’s 
64-team 
field 
will be solidified that evening, 
and, perhaps more importantly, 
college volleyball will find 
out whether Ann Arbor’s Cliff 
Keen Arena will be a host site.
No. 
18 
Michigan 
(20-9 
overall, 
9-9 
Big 
Ten) 
is 
practically 
guaranteed 
a 
spot in the field. Coming off 
the heels of securing their 
fourth 
consecutive 
20-win 
regular season with a four-
set victory in East Lansing 
last weekend, the Wolverines 
have established themselves 
as one of the nation’s top-tier 
programs.
Interestingly 
enough, 
the 
Wolverines are also ranked 
18th in RPI. This formula — a 
critical tool in the selection 
committee’s seeding decisions 
— is used to measure teams 
across 
Division 
I 
on 
one 
uniform scale based on their 
wins, losses and strength of 
schedule.
Every team ranked inside 
the top-37 of the NCAA’s final 
RPI release has qualified for 
the tournament field since 
2010. The Wolverines may be 
a shoo-in for the big dance, 
but that doesn’t 
mean they have 
nothing to worry 
about 
at 
this 
point.
Because only 
the top-16 seeds 
host 
NCAA 
Tournament 
matches, 
Michigan needs 
to make a pair 
of 
statement 
wins 
when 
Northwestern (15-5, 5-13) and 
Michigan State (17-14, 5-13) 
come to town on Wednesday 
and Saturday, respectively.
With a win in both matches, 
Michigan can cement a season 
series sweep of each opponent. 
Since 
the 
Wildcats 
and 
Spartans are both well outside 

of 
conference 
contention, 
losing a match to either team 
will eradicate any chance of 
this year’s NCAA Tournament 
coming to Ann Arbor. After 
Michigan 
split 
its 
season 
series against No. 8 Wisconsin 
and 
unranked 
Maryland, 
dropped both of its matches 
to No. 6 Nebraska and No. 7 
Penn State and compiled a 4-2 
record against Big Ten teams 
it only faced once, it can’t pass 
up 
a 
golden 
opportunity 
to 
secure 
a 
pair of season 
series 
sweeps 
at home in its 
last impression 
on the selection 
committee.
If 
the 
Wolverines 
can take care 
of 
business 
against 
two 
subpar opponents this week, 
they’ll put themselves in a 
strong position to reach the 
Sweet Sixteen if they capture 
one of the tournament’s highly-
coveted top-16 seeds and its 
accompanying right to a pair of 
home matches.
“We 
have 
great 
student 

representation (in Cliff Keen 
Arena),” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “They’re so fun, 
they’re so passionate, they’re 
funny, and they’re creative. Any 
time we have the students come 
out, it makes a big difference.”
One aspect that separates 
Cliff 
Keen 
Arena 
from 
other NCAA venues is its 
configuration. 
The 
arena 
only has stadium seating on 
three sides of the court; the 
fourth 
side 
is 
solely dedicated 
to 
The 
Zone 
— 
Michigan’s 
notoriously 
rowdy 
student 
section.
Most notably, 
the distance from 
the court to the 
beginning of the 
stands is next to 
nothing. 
With 
very little space 
separating the match from the 
crowd, Rosen’s players often 
claim that the crowd is more 
impactful at Cliff Keen than 
anywhere else.
“When you play in Cliff 
Keen, all the fans are close, 
much more than other arenas 
for sure,” said senior outside 

hitter Carly Skjodt. “We’re able 
to take the fans’ energy with us 
and use it.”
Since 
stepping 
onto 
the 
court at Cliff Keen Arena for 
the first time in the fall of 2015, 
Michigan’s trio of seniors — 
Skjodt, libero Jenna Lerg and 
setter Maddy Abbott — have 
amassed a remarkable 51-15 
record at home. Hosting a pair 
of NCAA Tournament matches 
would give the Wolverines’ 
senior class the 
chance to build 
on its dominant 
record in Ann 
Arbor 
while 
simultaneously 
saying a fitting 
goodbye 
to 
the 
friendly 
confines 
of 
Cliff 
Keen 
Arena.
“Cliff 
Keen 
is our home,” 
said 
junior 
opposite 
hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom on Oct. 
5 after sweeping then-No. 14 
Purdue. “We’re familiar with 
it — we practice there every day 
and it really feels like a home to 
all of us. The fans are a big part 
of that; they’re very passionate 
about representing Michigan.”

Zavier Simpson shines 
in Tip-Off Tournament

Zavier Simpson sat at a 
podium in Uncasville, Conn. on 
Sunday afternoon, somewhere 
inside the Mohegan Sun casino 
complex, fielding a slew of 
questions from reporters after 
Michigan won the Hall of Fame 
Tip-Off Tournament. It was 
a 
nearly 
identical 
situation 
to Saturday, when the junior 
guard was called on to answer 
questions about the Wolverines’ 
win over George Washington 
to advance to the championship 
game.
Only this time, he was flanked 
by freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis and junior center Jon 
Teske — replacing sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole and redshirt 
junior Charles Matthews from 
the previous day.
Simpson’s repeated presence 
on the podium was no product of 
circumstance.
Poole and Matthews stole 
Saturday’s 
headlines, 
with 
a combined 7-for-10 3-point 
shooting 
performance 
that 
sparked Michigan to its best 
offensive day of the season. 
That duo went quiet on Sunday, 
totaling just nine points as 
Brazdeikis and Teske led the 
Wolverines 
past 
Providence, 
66-47.
“Everybody can play on our 
team,” Brazdeikis said. “It’s not 
gonna be one person that’s gonna 
be the best player on the court 
every day. It’s gonna be, one day 
(Simpson), one day Jon (Teske), 
one day Charles (Matthews).”
But both days, Simpson was 
the stalwart at the heart of the 
Wolverines’ success on each end 
of the floor. Known as one of the 
nation’s premier defenders, his 
near-triple double on Saturday 
put his offense in the spotlight, 
as he joined in on the 3-point 
barrage with four of his own — a 
sixth of his total from last season.
“For him to have that success, 
to make those four threes, that’s a 
lot of work,” said Michigan coach 

John Beilein after Saturday’s 
win. “Now let’s go do it again, 
whoever we play tomorrow.”
Simpson didn’t replicate his 
3-point performance on Sunday 
— he attempted just five field 
goals, none from beyond the arc 
— but played an equally sized 
role in the Wolverines’ win.
After allowing a season-high 
61 points against the Colonials 
(let that sink in), Michigan’s 
defense was back to its stifling 
form 
against 
Providence, 
limiting the Friars to 47 points 
on 16-for-57 shooting. As usual, 
Simpson was at the crux of that.
Before the game, Providence’s 
success was deemed reliant 
on point guard Alpha Diallo, 
who came in averaging 19.5 
points and five assists per game. 
Matched up against Simpson, he 
turned the ball over four times 
and managed just 10 points on 
three-of-13 shooting — good 
for his worst KenPom offensive 
rating in 15 games.
“I think of defense as my 
pride,” 
Simpson 
said 
after 
the game. “I just want to pick 
everybody up, try my best to 
not let them score or try my 
best to help somebody who may 
not be in the right position. So, 
at the end of the day, we stress 
defense.”
While only scoring six points 
against the Friars, he remained 
a key cog of the Wolverines’ 
offense, with eight of their 15 
assists.
When 
Providence 
cut 
Michigan’s lead to two points 
near the end of the first half, 
it was Simpson who assisted a 
three and scored a basket of his 
own on consecutive possessions 
to extend the lead back to seven. 
By the time the Friars scored 
again, the lead was in double-
digits for good.
As usual, the Wolverines had 
Simpson’s contributions on both 
ends to thank for that.
“He is a bit of a coach on the 
floor — a stubborn coach on the 
floor,” Beilein said. “But he is just 
all in to win for Michigan.”

No Mercy

‘M’ blows out Detroit Mercy, 95-62

Detroit 
Mercy 
wasn’t 
supposed to put up a close fight 
against Michigan. Yet, with 4:44 
remaining in the first half, the 
Titans (1-4) scrapped their way 
to a three-point lead over the 
Wolverines (3-0).
Michigan, 
who 
would 
ultimately win the game 95-62, 
struggled early to find its rhythm. 
The Wolverines accumulated six 
turnovers in the first 15 minutes 
and shot a mere 3-for-9 from the 
free throw line in the first half — 
a consistent issue for Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico’s squad 
throughout this young season. 
Detroit Mercy capitalized on the 
Wolverines’ sloppy early play 
and shot over 50 percent from 
three in the first half. 
“I think we were playing 
to our opponent, we weren’t 
playing to our ability,” said 
senior center Hallie Thome. 
“We had three turnovers to start 
the game, so having that be the 
start of the game kind of makes 
everyone a little anxious.”
Then, as soon as the Titans 
took 
the 
lead, 
Thome 
and 
freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
took over — scoring a combined 
15 points in the final 4:30 of the 
half — leading Michigan on a 
20-0 run going into the locker 
room comfortably up 54-37. 
From 
there 
on 
out 
the 
Wolverines dominated, forcing 
turnover after turnover. Their 
active press defense forced a 
staggering 29 turnovers and 
never gave Detroit Mercy a 
chance to regain its footing and 
climb back into the game.
“(Hillmon) definitely helped 
us a lot,” Thome said. “Naz and 
the press. She definitely set the 
tone getting all those turnovers 
and those ten-second counts. So 
definitely to have someone, and 
especially a freshman, set that 

tone and give us that energy I 
think we needed at that point 
and having it carry over to all 
of us helped us be able to kinda 
(put) our foot on the gas and 
keep going.”
Thome — who scored 25 
points in just under 20 minutes 
— could not be matched by the 
smaller Titan team and scored 
nearly every time she shot the 
ball from the low post. 
Hillmon, meanwhile, injected 
an energy into the lineup that 
seemed to have been lacking 
since the opening tip. With 
Michigan running a press for 
much of the game, Hillmon 
raced all over the court, forcing 
turnovers and causing problems 
for the Titans. 
“(Hillmon’s) 
energy 
is 
contagious,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “I think she just does a 
tremendous job of bringing it 
each and every single day. I think 
it’s definitely a difference maker 
in our program’s success so it’s 
great to have her and I’m glad 
she’s playing well right now.”
Hillmon’s 
most 
intense 
moment, though, came with just 
over a minute remaining in the 
first half and the Wolverines up 
10. 
Following freshman guard 
Amy 
Dilk’s 
missed 
layup, 
Hillmon collected the rebound 
and put up a shot of her own 
while getting fouled. As soon 
as the ball slid through the 
cylinder, Hillmon turned around 
and let out an emphatic yell as 
she flexed her muscles toward 
her bench. 
“I like to bring a lot of energy 
to the game and if it’s ever flat I 
want to give a yell or a high five,” 
Hillmon said. “I think that being 
able to bring some energy to the 
team, that not only helps me and 
makes me want to go harder, but 
it definitely helps my teammates 
knowing that there’s somebody 
there encouraging them.”

Hillmon, who finished the 
game with 22 points and eight 
rebounds, and the rest of the 
Michigan starters, would not set 
foot on the court in the fourth 
quarter following the slow start 
with the game decidedly in 
hand.
The Wolverines will now 
prepare for the Gulf Coast 
Showcase, where they will first 
take on Missouri this Friday, 
Nov. 23, before playing two 
more games over the rest of the 
weekend. 
“I think we just really need to 
pay attention to detail because 
we’re going to be playing against 
some 
tremendous 
programs 
in Florida,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Every possession is going to 
matter; we need to be locked in 
and we need to be focused; we 
need to know our personnel, 
know 
our 
assignments. 
We’re going to have a quick 
turnaround, not a lot of prep 
time for the games, so it’s going 
to be important that we’re 
focused.”

Michigan struggles from stripe in win

The Wolverines beat Detroit 
Mercy handedly on Monday 
night, 95-62, but for much of 
the first half that result was 
anything but assured.
The 
two 
teams 
traded 
baskets deep into the second 
quarter. 
The 
Titans 
even 
managed 
a 
lead 
before 
Michigan rattled off a 20-0 
run to end the first half.
Two 
factors 
contributed 
to the Wolverines’ inability 
to 
jump 
out 
to 
a 
more 
commanding 
lead 
in 
the 
first fifteen minutes though: 
missed defensive assignments 
and poor free throw shooting. 
The former can be chalked up 
to spreading themselves too 
thin on the press — something 
they seemed to fix at halftime. 
But the latter is part of a more 
worrying trend.
Coming 
into 
the 
game, 
Michigan 
was 
27-for-45 
from 
the 
charity 
stripe, 

exactly 60-percent, a mark 
tied for 281st out of 349 
Division-I teams. A 10-for-19 
performance against Detroit 
Mercy does not help that 
average.
Within the context of such 
a blowout, poor free throw 
shooting might seem like a 
trivial problem, but as the 
Wolverines’ 
schedule heats 
up in the next 
week 
with 
games against 
Missouri, and 
possibly 
two 
other 
top-25 
teams, it may 
come back to 
bite them.
The 
struggles 
at the foul line are more 
of a confidence issue than 
anything 
according 
to 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico.
“I think that starts to get 
in your head a bit,” Barnes 

Arico said. “The key is just to 
get in the gym to just get your 
confidence back, get your 
touch back. And try not to 
think about the misses.”
Even key contributors and 
typically-efficient 
shooters 
like 
sophomore 
guard 
Deja Church — who shot 
74.7-percent last season — and 
freshmen Naz Hillmon have 
been susceptible to the trend 
so far.
“Coach was telling us just 
now that it’s in our heads, 
so we just have to shake it 
off and make ourselves more 
comfortable at the free throw 
line,” Hillmon said. “We need 
to avoid thinking too much 
about it or too little (about it).”
Senior Hallie Thome added 
in support of Church: “She’s 
kinda struggling at the line, 
but last year she made the 
hardest free throws. We were 
down three (against Nebraska) 
and Deja got fouled at the 
three-point line, made them, 
and we went into overtime. 
So I think it’s just definitely a 
mental thing.”
The season is young and the 
sample size is small. But since 
the Wolverines seem to be 
hitting on every 
other 
cylinder, 
they are looking 
to correct their 
foul-shooting 
struggles before 
it 
manifests 
into something 
bigger.
“You’ve been 
shooting 
them 
since you first 
started playing, 
since you were a little kid, so 
it’s something you can almost 
take 
for 
granted,” 
Barnes 
Arico said. “Right now, we 
can’t so we just have to make 
sure we focus on it a little bit 
more.”

“You’ve been 

shooting them 

since you first 

started playing.”

The tired verbiage of rivalry week
J

im Harbaugh doesn’t like 
making comparisons.
He says it demeans and 
diminishes accomplishments. 
Harbaugh, as he has done 
every year 
at Michigan, 
treaded 
lightly 
Monday to 
protect the 
focus of his 
players and 
not give 
opponent’s 
fodder.
Despite 
being the 
expected road for Harbaugh 
to take, it’s still strange. 
In Bo Schembechler’s 1989 
autobiography “Bo,” being 
conservative was the antithesis 
of what made him great.
“Quarterbacks are a special 
breed,” Schembechler wrote. 
“They need to be cocky, and 
the cockiest I ever had was 
probably Jim Harbaugh.”
Sitting at 0-3 against 
Ohio State as a coach so far, 
Harbaugh could just be saving 
face and reserving judgment. 
The farthest he went in 
Monday’s press conference was 
… not far at all. The message 
was standard, but the meaning 
was evident.
“I expect our team to be very 
motivated,” Harbaugh said. “I 
know I am.”
Yes, it’s rivalry week against 
the Buckeyes, so perhaps his 
caution is rooted in experience 
— a guarantee he made to beat 
Ohio State and an impending 
Rose Bowl appearance when 
Harbaugh was the Wolverines’ 
quarterback in 1986.
Though the high-stakes 
game is fast-approaching, the 
expectations of provocative 
speech should no longer exist 
for this point of the season. Yet, 
the questions are inescapable, 
and the answers are becoming 
the same.
“It’s the Big Game,” 
Harbaugh said about what 
motivates him. “Even got a 
name for it, doesn’t it?”
Even after Michigan won 
that 1986 game, 26-24, in 

Columbus, Harbaugh sings a 
different tune, as well as in the 
years following his declaration. 
Dating back to his introductory 
press conference in 2014, 
he doesn’t make guarantees 
anymore: “I’ve learned from 
that.”
About an hour after 
Harbaugh stepped away from 
the podium Monday, senior 
running back Karan Higdon 
stood in the same spot, with 
tight end Zach Gentry hulking 
him to his right. A reporter 
asked the question — goaded, 
essentially — that now serves 
as a prerequisite in a sound bite 
media landscape: Like your 
coach, will you guarantee a 
win?
Higdon and Gentry shared 
a look. What came after was 
expected.

“Yeah, I do. I do,” Higdon 
said, followed by a laugh. 
“That’s how I feel. I believe 
firmly in my brothers and this 
team and this coaching staff. 
And as a captain, I’ll take that 
stand. Why not?”
It was 
definitive, but 
it was hardly 
the assertion 
Harbaugh made 
32 years ago. 
Higdon is a 
captain of the 
No. 4 team in 
the country 
with conference 
and national 
title hopes at stake. Yet, it has 
already grabbed headlines and 
incited social media furor.
It was not an unprompted 
guarantee, and with the game’s 

implications, should not be 
treated as such. The only 
notable aspect is that it breaks 
the character of a seemingly 
unbothered Michigan team.
“Having done it, I don’t 
recommend it,” 
Harbaugh said of 
guaranteeing a 
win in The Game 
in 2016.
Though more 
subtle, junior 
linebacker Devin 
Bush also made 
a lofty claim, 
referencing the 
2016 overtime 
loss on Monday.
“That was one of those 
games where we didn’t finish,” 
Bush said. “We’ve got another 
opportunity to go in there.
“And I believe we’re gonna 

finish the job.”
It’s not breaking news. 
With everything to lose, the 
past shouldn’t be considered, 
and there is every reason to 
think the game will be close. 
Junior left guard Ben Bredeson 
said “It’s just different in this 
game,” with the exasperation of 
three years of getting the same 
question.
Ohio State coach Urban 
Meyer also spoke with the 
media in Columbus on Monday. 
He assumed the same demeanor 
as Harbaugh, even talking about 
mutual respect.
“I can only speak for myself, 
but I think the ‘R-word’ is 
critical here,” he said. “… How 
do you respect them and The 
Game? You work so very hard to 
do your best.”
There is never truly a 

breaking point of the exhaustive 
responses and unsettled debates 
for this rivalry. It’s interesting 
to hear Bredeson reflect on how 
getting flipped off energizes 
him, or how Bush feeds into the 
boos. Sharing experiences and 
the boredom of sameness are 
not mutually exclusive.
Another reporter asked 
Harbaugh then if it was just 
another game on the College 
Football Playoff hunt.
“Of course not,” Harbaugh 
replied with disgust, like it was 
blasphemous that the question 
was asked at all.
Rivalry week doesn’t need to 
have a different tone. It speaks 
for itself.
