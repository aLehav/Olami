Speaker from Arizona
discusses life as
an undocumented

By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
On a January morning, Erika
Andiola looked out the window to
find police officers outside of her
house. After entering the house, they
arrested her brother and mother and
deported them to their home country
of Mexico.
After a brief moment of shock,
I Andiola chose to take action.
"I never felt so angry and so sad at
the same time," Andiola said.
Andiola - an activist for undocu-
mented immigrants in Arizona -
spoke to about 40 students Thursday
detailing her personal story of fight-
ing for immigration rights in an event
hosted by the Coalition for Tuition
Equality, a group of 31 organizations
on campus fighting to attain in-state
tuition for undocumented Michigan
residents.
As a student at Arizona State Uni-
versity, Andiola paid out-of-state
tuition and received no loans or finan-
cial aid as an undocumented student.
However, after being selected as a
Dream Scholar - a $4,000 scholar-
ship - and receiving private funding
for her education, Andiola connected
with other undocumented students
on ASU's campus and joined the fight
for immigration reform.
Since then, Andiola has advocated
for the DREAM Act - a law enacted
in 12 states that allows public institu-
tions to grant aid to undocumented
students - and has lobbied for immi-
gration reform in Washington D.C.
Because of Andiola's work in
reform, her family and other undocu-

Ben Folds performs at Hill Auditorium Monday night at the MUSIC Matters benefit concert. The organization is raising money to endow a scholar-
ship for students in need of financial aid.
Ben Folds rocks the Hill

Singer-songwriter
plays to raise funds for
student scholarship
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
After his sell-out show at Hill Audi-
torium on Thursday night, recording
artist Ben Folds performed in a much
more intimate setting at the University
of Michigan Hillel.
Folds' concert performance was the
final product of SpringFest, a series of
events put on by MUSIC Matters, a stu-
dentorganizationthatholds ayearlycon-
cert to raise money for charity. This year,
the money will go toward a scholarship
for low-income students.
A year in the making, the second
annual event likely raised more than the
$100,000 collected at last year's J. Cole
concert, through sponsorships, letter
campaigns and ticket sales.
The group also hosted a Battle of the
Bands contest last week at Scorekeep-
ers bar and grill. The winner of the tal-
ent competition, Motel Model, was the
opening act of Folds' show, performing
before California-based band Radical
Something.
LSA senior Megan Pfeiffer, vice

president of MUSIC Matters, said the
club decided to feature Folds to bring
a different flavor from the last year's
concert.
Though she believes the event raised
more moneythanlastyear's, Pfeiffersaid
the exact figure isn't known yet, and the
organization will release the figure in a
few weeks. Regardless, MUSIC Matters
is one of the first student organizations
to endow an incoming University student
with a scholarship based on need.
Pfeiffer said MUSIC Matters collabo-
rated with Hillel, CSG and several other
organizations to make the night's events
a reality. The group is also working with
the Graham Institute and the Student
Sustainability Initiative to ensure the
long-term sustainability of this scholar-
ship.
"We're doing a lot of collaboration,"
Pfeiffer said. "We all get things out of it,
we all have the same goals."
During a brief speech to members of
Hillel and MUSIC Matters at the after-
concert talk, Folds discussed why he
believes music is an important part of
education. He said it was amazing that
college students took the initiative to
raise scholarship funds for a fellow stu-
dent.
"When I was your age, it was like
a dog-eat-dog world," Folds said. "I
commend you for whatever's happen-

ing in the world that people are getting
involved in such a good way."
Folds also took time to discuss music
therapies and the importance of musi-
cians and artists today. Following the
speech, he took about 40 minutes to
answer questions and give advice to bud-
ding musicians and inspired fans.
"I'm more and more into (charity)
because it feels and good and my intu-
ition is that's what music is worth," he
said. "I just wantto be useful."
Topics in the question-and-answer
session ranged from his infamous Chat
Roulette concert improvisations to the
meaning behind certain songs and lyrics.
LSA junior Gianna Marx, MUSIC
Matter's vice president for publicity and
advertising, said her favorite part of the
planning process was working collabora-
tively with her team. Pfeiffer seconded
Marx's notion.
"We all came together to accomplish
one goal," Marx said. "It resulted in an
awesome experience for everyone."
LSA freshman Sahar Atassi, a member
of MUSIC Matters, said her favorite part
of the evening was the talk after the con-
cert because of the personal anecdotes
Folds shared.
"It's interesting to hear his view-
points," Atassi said. "He's an inspiring
artist so it's interesting to pick his brain
a little bit."

ADMINISTRATION
Survey
tells'U
howit's
doing
UMAY questionnaire
looks into students'
experiences
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Every semester, scores of online
research surveys flood inboxes,
prodding students to consider top-
ics ranging from CTools to casual
sexual encounters.
But since 2009, the University
has distributed an undergraduate
survey of a different kind - one
hoping to provide administrators,
colleges and departments with a
wider window into the student
experience. The appeal stated on
the "University of Michigan Asks
You" or UMAY survey's website is
simple. "Tell Michigan what you're
thinking."
The survey, which went live late
last month, asks students to respond
to questions gauging their Univer-
sity experiences in areas such as
diversity, academics, campus life
and affordability.
Now in its fourth round after
being offered in 2009, 2010, and
2011, the University joins many
other public research universities,
in addition to the nine campuses
of the University of California
system, in conducting this type of
survey.
The cost to the University of par-
ticipating in the survey is $20,000
per year, in addition to the costs
associated with data collection and
other administrative aspects. The
survey is sponsored by the Office of
Provost and administered by Will
Greenland and Karen Zaruba, who
work in the Office of Budget and
Planning.
After its start at University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley, the University was
one of the first schools approached
to join a consortium of universities
administering the survey. Though
the survey is nearly identical at all
campuses, it includes a fourth mod-
ule that can be customized by each
participatinguniversity.
Each year, member universities
convene to discuss potential ques-
tions and adjust previous survey
forms. Zaruba said that in 2010, the
universities decided to add a mod-
ule concerning financial topics to
address the recent economic down-
turn.
Greenland said the University
often uses the data gained from the
survey to spur conversations among
multiple University departments,
offices and colleges.
"One of the best uses of the
data is you can look at two differ-

ent populations on campus and
see how their population is differ-
ent," Greenland said. "One number
doesn't tell you a lot. If you look at
two populations and they have a
different number, that can tell you
something."
Engineering Prof. James Hol-
loway, associate Engineering dean
for undergraduate education, said
he and Engineering Dean Dave
Munson often face stacks of hun-
dreds of pages of data on their
desks when the survey data is
released.
Holloway said the survey data is
important for sparking conversa-
tions within academic units. For
example, after comparing sur-
vey results on academic advising
throughout departments, engineer-

Maya Dusenbery, editor
of the blog Feministing, says
that in order to solve the issue
of sexual assault we need to
change "rape culture" through

open conversations. She tried
to open students up to talking
about sexual assault at an event

Dusenbery spoke to about50
people in an event sponsored

focused on sexual assault and
the media coverage it receives,
centering the discussion on the
Steubenville, Ohio rape case,
in which several high-school
football players took advan-

tage of a teenage girl after she
was passed out drunk. 'The
case garnered the attention of
global media after photos of
the perpetrators were posted
on social media.
Dusenbery said she was
frustrated that the news cov-
erage addressed the failings
of the accused rather than the
damage to the survivor.
"The coverage basically
expressed sort-of empathy,"

Syrian gov. counterattack kills
45 in response to rebel forces

Women, children
among those killed
by regime
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian gov-
ernment forces launched a
counteroffensive in the south,
capturing a town and killing at
least 45 people including women
and children, opposition activ-
ists said Thursday.
The attack onthe town of Sana-
mein followed a rebel advance in
the area in recent weeks. They
opposition fighters captured
army bases and a major town in
the strategic province of Daraa
along the border with Jordan.
"They slaughtered any person
they found," an activist in the
nearby town of Busra al-Harir
who goes by the fake name of
Hamza al-Hariri told The Asso-
ciated Press via Skype. He would
not give his real name for fear of
government reprisals.

"This is the ugliest massa-
cre since the one in Houla," he
added,referringto aregionin the
central province of Homs where
more than 100 civilians were
killed by government forces in
Maylast year.
Rebels advancing in the south
in recent weeks have been aiming
to secure a corridor from the Jor-
danian border to Damascus about
60 miles away in preparation for
an eventual assault on the capital.
Regional officials and military
experts note a sharp increase in
weapons shipments to opposition
fighters by Arab governments,
in coordination with the U.S., in
the hopes of readying a push into
Damascus - the ultimate prize in
the civil war that has killed more
than 70,000 in two years.
Rebels already control vast
portions of northern Syria bor-
dering Turkey.
State-run Syrian TV said the
armed forces "wiped out terror-
ist groups" in Sanamein and the

.5.-,l

nearby town of Ghabagheb. It
added that troops were target-
ing rebel hideouts in different
parts of Daraa. They included
the villages and towns of Tafas,
Jasssim, Dael and Tseel and the
report said they had inflicted
casualties in those areas.
The city of Daraa, the provin-
cial capital, was the birthplace
of the uprising against President
Bashar Assad in March 2011
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
activist group reported clashes
on Thursday in the city of Daraa
and said there were casualties
among regime troops.
State-run Syrian TV said
government forces killed or
wounded dozens of gunmen in
the city of Daraa, including for-
eign fighters.
The Observatory said at least
45 people, including five chil-
dren and seven women, were
killed in the attack on Sana-
mein. It said they were killed
by "shooting, shelling and field
execution," a reference to peo-
ple reported to have been shot
at close range.
The Syrian National Coali-
tion, the main opposition group,
said more than 60 people were
"brutally" killed in the town.
After troops stormed Sanamein,
the group said they used some
civilians as human shields and
took others as hostages before
looting some homes.
The differing death tolls
could not be reconciled.
The SNC said the regime car-
ried out the attack in Sanamein
after it failed "to stop the opera-
tion to liberate the province of
Daraa, the southern entrance to
Damascus."
In addition to the stronghold
in the north, rebels have also
captured parts of the east along
the border with Iraq recent-
ly. But the strategic region
between the southern outskirts
of Damascus and Jordan -
known as the Houran plains -
is seen as a crucial gateway to
the capital.

Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, spoke at the Tanner Lecture on Human Values symposium in
Rackham Thursday.
Director of London School
talks publicinstitutions

Calhoun believes
"public" orgs are
excluding majority
of public
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
Daily StaffReporter
Public is usually defined as
"open to all," but Craig Calhoun,
director of the London School
of Economics and Political Sci-
ence, believes that many "pub-
lic" organizations are becoming
more and more exclusive.
Calhoun discussed this shift
in his speech "Publicness (and
its problems)," which he deliv-
ered to an audience of about 100
people at Rackham Auditorium
on Thursday. He focused on the
notion of "public" in relation
to the rise of society and sys-
tem integration. Calhoun said
that, over time, the demarcation
between what is public and what
is private is becoming more com-

plicated.
Calhoun discussed how sev-
eral public institutions have
been reorganized, adjusting
what public really means within
such organizations. He suggest-
ed that some firms are retain-
ing the term "public" but have
become exclusive by selectively
allowing only certain members
of the public in, such as univer-
sities.
Calhoun cited the expansion
of the public sphere as the reason
behind its growing exclusivity
and suggested that communica-
tion will help solve this problem.
He added that improved debates
and discussions would shape the
future of the public.
"Large-scale socialization
and mediated communication is
either the devil or the angel that
we want on our side," he said.
Calhoun said movements,
cultural change and connec-
tions are also critical in solving
the issues of the public sphere.
These will depend on the consti-
tution of an inclusive, intercon-

nected field of public action with
multiple, but overlapping and
interactivepublics, he said.
While Calhoun said the evo-
lution of society threatens both
the public and private, public-
ness has the capacity for great
action. Calhoun argued that the
expansion of economy, statistics
and administration affects the
"partial publieness" of ordinary
life.
Calhoun said real privacy has
been "squeezed," eliminating
people's solitude, while public-
ness has also been pushed aside,
since people are unable to fully
discuss and take action on their
ideas within the society.
Thursday's lecture was the
opening event for the Tanner
Lecture on Human Values.
The two-day symposium con-
tinues Friday at the Rackham
Amphitheater from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. featuring Prof. Geoff Eley,
chair of the history depart-
ment, and Sociology and Ger-
manic Languages Prof. George
Steinmetz.

Mayor Dave Bing is proposing
to cut the Detroit City Council's

The recommendations are part
of the city's 2013-14 budget that
Bing will present Friday morning

Six automakers, including
Toyota, Honda and Nissan, are
recalling nearly 3.4 million older-

of defective air bags that can send
shrapnel flying into the passenger
compartment.
The recall mainly affects cars
sold by Japanese automakers
in North America, Europe and
Japan. A small number of cars
made by Germany's BMW AG
and General Motors Co. and also
involved.
The front passenger air bags all
were made by the same parts sup-
plier, Japan's Takata Corp. They
have faulty inflator mechanisms
that don't route gas into the air
bags. Instead, the high-pressure
gas can launch plastic and metal

cars' passenger areas. Takata says
no one has been hurt, but there
have been six incidents of the air

A federal judicial panel on

they fail to comply.
In its ruling, the three-judge

population to the level ordered by
the federal courts.
In January, the governor sought
to end the long-running court

again to the U.S. Supreme Court if
necessary. At the time, he decried
the billions of dollars California is

the court had ordered the state to
create "gold plate" prisons that
were siphoning money from public
schools, colleges, social services

and other programs.

Egypt's legislature
approves revised

Egypt's Islamist-dominated
legislature approved a revised
version of the law organizing the
country's parliamentary elections
on Thursday, after a court ruled
an earlier version was invalid and
delayed the vote.
The parliamentary elections
had been scheduled to start this
month, but the ruling said the law
must be reviewed by the Supreme
Constitutional Court before elec-

asked for amendments to the ear-

Thursday's approval was made

"Despite all of the contributions

RAPE CULTURE
From Page 1
Dusenbery said in an interview
after the lecture. "The way
that they were doing it was in
this way that was completely
ignoring the fact that the rea-
son they were convicted was
because they committed this
crime."
Dusenbery also expressed
her specific concerns about
the case, noting her surprise
about the accused's clear mis-
understanding of consent.
She said the current concep-
tion of rape conveys a "no-
means-no" culture, allowing

a denial as valid sexual con-
sent. She said that this needs
to be changed.
"When we're talking about
rape culture, we're talking
about the culture that we live
in every day," Dusenbery said.
"To completely reach the goal
would be to completely trans-
form the culture."
Holly Rider-Milkovich,
director of SAPAC, said she has
been a long-time fan of Femi-
nisting and that both SAPAC
and Feministing share similar
strategies and goals in dealing
with sexual assault. She added
that SAPAC uses posts from
Feministing to help achieve
their mutual goals.

hopes of hearing the regents'

LSA junior John D'Adamo, a
spokesman for CTE, said in an
interview after the event that
Andiola and Karafili's speeches
inspired students to get involved
in the issue.
"It's really a movement
that's going all throughout the

D'Adamo said. "We are really

D'Adamo said CTE hopes the

these issues."
Rider-Milkovich said that
Dusenbery echoed many of
SAPAC's hopes to deal with
the issue of social power as it
relates to sexual assault and
its role within different social
groups.
"When we make it not OK
to commit violence against
anyone, then that social power
becomes vacated. It doesn't
have the same resonance,"
Rider-Milkovich said "So one
of the things that we can do to
identify and erode the power
and control that happens
when one commits violence
against another is to not give
people props, not reward them
by talking about the behav-
ior..."
LSA freshman Celina Roma-
no, who attended the event, said
she was happy to hear an open
discussion about rape in soci-
ety and how it's handled. Still,
Romano said that as a woman
and a freshman at a large uni-
versity, she needs to be cau-
tious.
"While I think that the Uni-
versity does a lot to try and keep
women safe, there are a lot of
things that, obviously, things
happen, and they aren't brought
to light," Romano said, "And
there are plenty of situations on
this campus that create unsafe
environments for women."

Gun control bill
clears first hurdle

Sandy Hook victims'
families watched
from gallery above
the senate floor
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con-
gress' most serious gun-control
effort in years cleared its first
hurdle Thursday as the Sen-
ate pushed past conservatives'
attempted blockade under the
teary gaze of families of victims
of December's Connecticut
school shootings.
The bipartisan 68-31 vote
rebuffed an effort to keep
debate from even starting, giv-
ing an early victory - and per-
haps political momentum - to
President Barack Obama and
his gun control allies. Four
months after 20 first-graders
and six staffers at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in Newtown
were killed, relatives watching
the vote from a gallery over-
looking the Senate floor dabbed
at tears and clasped hands,
some seeming to pray.
Even so, few supporters of
the legislation are confident of
victory. Several weeks of emo-
tional, unpredictable Senate
debate lie ahead, and a mix of
gun-rights amendments, oppo-
sition from the National Rifle
Association and skepticism
from House Republican lead-
ers leave big questions about
what will emerge from Con-

gress. Foes of the proposed
new restrictions say they would
penalize law-abiding citizens
and do nothing to curb gun vio-
lence.
"The hard work starts now,"
said Senate Majority Lead-
er Harry Reid, D-Nev., who
brought the legislation to the
floor for debate.
Still, in a Congress marked
by a notable lack of coopera-
tion between Democrats and
Republicans, Thursday's vote
was one of several displays of
unusual rapport across party
lines. In other examples not
connected to the issue of guns:
Negotiators for the two par-
ties said they had reached
agreement on the major ele-
ments of a Senate immigration
bill they're expected to unveil
next week.
The top Republican in gov-
ernment, House Speaker John
Boehner of Ohio, publicly dis-
agreed with his party cam-
paign chairman's criticism of
Obama's budget proposal to
trim future Social Security and
Medicare benefits. Wednes-
day night, GOP senators left a
White House dinner praising
Obama for reaching out to them
on his budget.

N. Korea may have
ballistic missile with
nuclear warhead,
though unreliable
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Hinting at a missile
launch, North Korea delivered
a fresh round of war rhetoric
Thursday with claims it has
"powerful striking means" on
standby. Seoul and Washington
speculated that it is preparing
to test-fire a missile designed to
be capable of reaching the U.S.
territory of Guam in the Pacific
Ocean.
The latest rhetoric came
as new U.S. intelligence was
revealed showing North Korea
is now probably capable of arm-
ing a ballistic missile with a
nuclear warhead.
On the streets of Pyongyang,
North Koreans shifted into
party mode as they celebrated
the anniversary of leader Kim
Jong Un's appointment to the
country's top party post - one
in a slew of titles collected a
year ago in the months after his
father Kim Jong Il's death.
But while there was calm in
Pyongyang, there was condem-
nation in London, where for-
eign ministers from the Group
of Eight nations slammed North
Korea for "aggressive rhetoric"
that they warned would only
further isolate the impover-
ished, tightly controlled nation.
North Korea's provocations,
including a long-range rocket
launch in December and an
underground nuclear test in
February, "seriously undermine

regional stability, jeopardize
the prospects for lasting peace
on the Korean Peninsula and
threaten international peace
and security," the ministers said
in a statement.
In the capital of neighbor-
ing South Korea, the country's
point person on relations with
the North, Unification Minister
Ryoo Kihl-jae, urged Pyong-
yang to engage in dialogue and'
reverse its decision to pull work-
ers from a joint industrial park
just north of their shared bor-
der, a move that has brought fac-
tories there to a standstill.
"We strongly urge North
Korea not to exacerbate the cri-
sis on the Korean Peninsula,"
Ryoo said.
North Korea probably has
advanced its nuclear know-
how to the point where it could
arm a ballistic missile with a
nuclear warhead, but the weap-
on wouldn't be very reliable,
the U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency has concluded. The DIA
assessment was revealed Thurs-
day at a public hearing in Wash-
ington.
President Barack Obama
warned the unpredictable
communist regime that his
administration would "take
all necessary steps" to protect
American citizens.
In his first public comments
since North Korea escalated
its rhetoric, Obama urged the
north to end its nuclear threats,
saying it was time for the isolat-
ed nation "to end the belligerent
approach they have taken and to
try to lower temperatures."
"Nobody wants to see a con-
flict on the Korean Peninsula,"
Obama added, speaking from

the oval Office alongside United
Nations Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon.
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry was headed to Seoul on
Friday for talks with South
Korean officials before heading
on to China.
"If anyone has real leverage
over the North Koreans, it is
China," U.S. Director of Nation-
al Intelligence James Clapper
told Congress on Thursday.
"And the indications that we
have are that China is itself rath-
er frustrated with the behavior
and the belligerent rhetoric of...
Kim Jong Un."
In the latest threat from
Pyongyang, the Committee for
the Peaceful Reunification of
the Fatherland, a nonmilitary
agency that deals with relations
with South Korea, said "strik-
ing means" have been "put on
standby for a launch and the
coordinates of targets put into
the warheads." It didn't clarify,
but the language suggested a
missile.
The statement was the latest
in a torrent of warlike threats
seen outside Pyongyang as an
effort to raise fears and- pres-
sure Seoul and Washington into
changing their North Korea
policies, and to show the North
Korean people that their young
leader is strong enough to stand
up to powerful foes.
Referring to Kim Jong Un,
Clapper told Congress that
"I don't think ... he has much
of an endgame other than
to somehow elicit recogni-
tion," and to turn the nuclear
threat into "negotiation and to
accommodation and presum-
ably for aid."

Consistency with contraception
States should be more committed to reproductive rights
013 marks the forty-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade, in which
the Supreme Court ruled in favor of legalizing abortions in the
United States. Flash forward 40 years from that historic date,
and the U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman recently ruled that
age restrictions on the emergency contraception "Plan B One-Step,"
as well as its generic versions, were "arbitrary, capricious and unrea-
sonable" - further advancing the movement for the full reproductive
rights of women. Before this decision, teens younger than 17 couldn't
purchase Plan B without a prescription, and it was only sold through
family-planning clinics or pharmacies. Now, Plan B will be sold on the
shelves of stores and pharmacies nationwide for persons of any age.
While it's great to see the federal government discussing women's
issues and making steps to granting women full reproductive rights,
many states are unfortunately not on the same page.

What's up with the recent
polling for the 2016
Presidential election?
It seems that
there's a poll
coming out
nearly every
day about the
2016 race.
From potential
candidates to
projections,
polling orga- PAUL
nizations and SHERMAN
media outlets
have decided
to devote some
time to this story. Representatives
of Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) have
even announced that they are going
to decide by this June about his
presidential bid. In all honesty, it
makes me sick to my stomach.
Ever since the end of the 2012
election cycle, media outlets such
as MSNBC and CNN have been
talking about who will run in 2016.
To me, it's ridiculous that we're
beginning to have these discus-
sions now. The election is more
than 1,306 days away! This type of
polling isn't constructive, as there
are more important problems that
we should be addressing.
While there have been some cases
in which the polls accurately picked
the candidates, most of them have
not done so. According to a Gallup
poll from July 2009, "72 percent of
Republicans and Republican-lean-
ing independents have a favorable
opinion of Palin, compared with 56
percent for Romney and 59 percent
for Huckabee." Obviously, neither
Palin nor Huckabee ended up mak-
ing it past the primaries. For the
2004 election, polls projected the top
three Democratic candidates to be
Hillary Clinton, former Vice Presi-

dent Al Gore and Sen. Joe Lieberman
(I-Conn.), yet John Kerry won the
Democratic nomination. These polls
may tell us how voters feel about the
two political parties now. However, a
lot can happen in four years to make
voters change their minds.
Part of the problem is statistical
bias. Polls won't be accurate if they
don't find a representative sample
of the population. This is difficult
since it would be expensive to find
a large enough sample that can be
representative of the entire Ameri-
can population. However, if this
condition isn't met, the amount
of bias increases and the accuracy
decreases. Polls can also suffer
from what's called response bias.
This occurs when pollsters attempt
to predict what would have been
the response from participants
who don't respond to the questions.
As an article in The Economist
describes, when pollsters have to
call people who don't have land-
lines or don't pick up their phones,
for example, "they are left guessing
about how to weight their views,"
which can create bias and "lead to
lots of mistaken predictions."
However, there's a place for these
early polls. For lesser-known candi-
dates, such as Cory Booker, mayor
of Newark, New Jersey, it helps
them gauge their support and fig-
ure out the actions they need to take
to become more prominent in the
national dialogue. Not only that, it
can help us to understand American
opinions of the two political parties,
Congress, the presidency and so on.
In an article on Slate, John Dicker-
son said that talking about presi-
dential races can "excite ambition,
which causes politicians to take
risks, which can start conversations
about important ideas. Our day-to-
day political life is small, but in the

presidential conversation, it's still
possible to imagine bigger things."
In the grand
scheme of things,
polls are simply a
distraction.
There are also other problems
in polling, such as the "likely voter
model" and the push poll. As Frank
Newport, editor-in-chief of Gal-
lup, explained in an article by Ezra
Klein in the Washington Post,
the likely voter model "takes into
account changes in the response to
questions about how closelythey're
following and how enthusiastic
they are," he said. "It's not just cap-
turing underlying movement - it's
representing changes in enthusi-
asm." In addition, the push poll has
been used, which is when a small
sample of about 300 to 1000 people
are used for solely measuring how
information can change public
opinion, according to Stu Rothen-
berg of Roll Call. Because of these
problems, it's hard to tell whether
or not polls accurately reflect the
views of the American public.
So, in the next year or so, stop
talking about 2016. America is facing
more pertinent issues right now. It's
difficult for Congress to even pass
fiscal proposals that will keep the
government open for business. In the
grand scheme of things, polls for the
2016 election are just another dis-
traction that America doesn't need.

According to a study reported by health.
com, more than 30 percent of sexually active
adolescents believed emergency contracep-
tives induce abortion. This is simply not true.
Rather, Plan B is a pill with a high dosage of
hormones that prevents the release of a fertil-
izableeggandmustbetakenwithinthreedays
of unprotected sexual intercourse. Taking
Plan B when pregnant is ineffective, because
the fertilized egg has already attached itself
to the wall of the uterus. Plan B also makes
no difference if an egg has already been fer-
tilized. Schools should be educating students
to eliminate the misconceptions of Plan B so
that it can be utilized as a normal and safe
option of backup birth control, especially if
primary birth control fails. With effective
dissemination of information coupled with
this new ruling, unwanted pregnancies could
likely be reduced.
Under the previous law for Plan B, teens
younger than 17 had to find a health care pro-
vider to provide a prescription if they were in
need of the pill. The alternative was getting
and older person to buy it for them, which was
illegal. Since every hour counts, the recent rul-
ing allows women and teens to control their
own sexual health and purchase the medicine
if they need it, eliminating humiliating emer-

gency trips to the doctor for a prescription.
While this ruling is encouraging, it also
draws attention to areas of the country where
women's sexual health is being compromised.
For example, in Missouri on April 4, the state
senate passed a law allowing pharmacies to
refuse to stock certain prescription drugs
- notably emergency contraception and
birth control. The pharmacies believe that
they should be allowed to stock what they
choose and if they so desire not to sell emer-
gency contraception for personal beliefs,
they no longer have to. While pharmacies
are businesses, owners have a responsibility
to provide necessary medications and doing
otherwise impinges on the rights of women to
have access to crucial medical care.
With this ruling, the judiciary joins a
larger governmental trend of taking a posi-
tive stance on women's rights. Other recent
accomplishments include free birth control
under the Affordable Care Act, which is now
applicable to most women with health insur-
ance in 2013. While there are some limita-
tions to the free birth control, it has positively
affected many women who are on the pill.
Given these results and recent actions by the
federal government, it's time states follow
suit and expand on women's rights as well.

Back to reality

So, that'll be the only time I'll ever get to
see two fraternity brothers peck each other
on the lips - soberly at least. The Kansas
game was a game every fan dreams of - a
come-from-behind victory with a buzzer-
beatingshot sendingthe teams into overtime.
You watched it, you celebrated it, but did you
get to see two heterosexual fraternity broth-
ers - both with girlfriends - kiss through
tears of joy? And then, just a week later, the
tears were no longer those of joy, but of frus-
tration and loss over agreat seasonthat ended
just shy of a fairytale.
The emotion of the NCAA men's basketball
tournament is raw and real. The history of the
fatal Fab Five timeout, the freshman starters,
the most-likely final season for Trey Burke
and Tim Hardaway Jr. and the rebooting of
the once-great Michigan basketball program
all combined to make this loss a hard punch
to the gut.
My friend, who goes to a small liberal arts
college in Vermont where the biggest sport is
Quidditch, sent me this text: "Your boys put
on a fight, but it was not quite good enough."
What she didn't understand was how the
campus deflated after that. Melanie Kruvelis
wrote a column describing how the scene late
Monday night would have been a little differ-
ent if we had won or lost. While I agree the
actions might have been similar - people get-
ting drunk, fights and burning couches - the
atmosphere couldn't have been more different.
We wanted to win not for ourselves, but for
them. So that Spike could have his best game
be the game that we won the national cham-
pionship. So Trey and Tim could leave behind
not only a legacy, buta national championship
banner. So Mitch McGary's breakout stardom
would be complete. So the Fab Five would
finally not be the yardstick that measures

Michigan basketball.
The Shapiro Undergraduate Library, where
I went after the game to study for an organic
chemistry test, had a stillness about it. But
unlike after the Kansas game or the Final
Four, it wasn't because students had said,
"Fuck school, this is a once ina lifetime expe-
rience." Instead, no one could focus. No one
wanted to even try. We wanted to hold on to
the last few hours where we could talk about
the game because it was the most important
thing on campus.
And then Tuesday came.
While the East Coast and even Ohio expe-
rienced a warm front, Tuesday morning gave
Ann Arbor an overcast day with on-and-off
rain - mimicking the tears of Nik Stauskas as
he tried to complete his post-game interview.
The game was no longer the only thing on
everyone's mind. We had to deal with all the
work we had put off. The referees' bad calls
didn't consume every conversation. It was
back to the real world, one that looked slight-
ly gloomier and slightly harsher than the one
we had left behind on March 29.
It's a world where frat boys don't kiss and
grown men don't cry. One where I don't blow
off studying the day before an organic chem-
istry test and students don't drive 11 hours
without a plan or a ticket. This world is a little
less spontaneous, and sometimes I think that
maybe that other world had its priorities a lit-
tle bit straighter. Should I spend hours on end
in a cinder block building to study or should I
go outside and enjoy the world, do something
impulsive and unplanned that might be bad
for my GPA? I guess it's true, but I must ask
myself, "Why do I need five talented guys to
make living my life to the fullest acceptable?"

Femen, a Ukraine-based self-
identified "sextremist" women's
movement, labeled April 4 as "Inter-
national Topless Jihad Day." Global
demonstrations insupportof ayoung
Tunisian woman sparked many reac-
tions because images of her naked
body were marked with politically
charged messages. Years ago, when
the veil-ban was ahot topic in France,
Femen staged protests where they
dressed in burgas before collectively
stripping. More recently, the group
demonstrated in Stockholm in front
of the Egyptian embassy with their
bare bodies displaying phrases like
"Sharia is not a constitution," "Free-
dom for women!" and "No Islamism,
yes secularism!"
Before hearing anything about
this event, April 4 was a big day for
me, too. After months of rehearsing,
it was the night I would perform
in the campus production of The
Hijabi Monologues. I was excited
for this rare platform to share the
stories of Muslim women's diverse,
complex experiences; honest and
humanizing narratives that discuss
our celebrations and challenges.
To Femen, however, this sort of
initiative would be cast as irrel-
evant, even pitiful, because as it
turns out, I, along with millions of
Muslim women around the globe,
am suffering from a case of "false-
consciousness." To Femen, the
very idea behind hijab, and, more
generally, religion (read: Islam) is
intrinsically, solely and perpetually
harmful to women. This is where
Femen comes in to save us and help
us realize a self-affirmation that
we otherwise would never experi-
ence. Thanks to the efforts of those
who staged topless actions in front
of mosques and embassies across
Europe with makeshift beards,
towels on their heads, painted cres-
cents on their breasts and signs
that read, "Muslim women, let's get
naked!" I should now feel support-
ed, affirmed and liberated.
Shockingly, I don't.
My aversion to Femen has little
to do with their sensationalist tac-
tics and everythingto do with their
exclusivist approach to feminism,

imperialist rhetoric of salvation
and simplistic assumptions on lib-
eration, all of which are far from
what the group's message sets out
to be: radical and progressive.
The group's exclusivist approach
reminds me of the first and second
waves of feminism in the United
States, where the mainstream
women's movement marginal-
ized women who didn't agree with
its approach and instead sought
to define its own concerns and
struggles as the most pressing and
as "universal." As a result, Third
World feminists during this era
were pressured to choose between
adopting the struggle for women's
liberation or ethnic liberation.
They defied this restricting binary
framework and instead called for a
more interconnected approach that
simultaneously addresses multiple
structures of oppression. There
are valuable lessons to be learned
from this phase of the women's
movement, but Femen isn't paying
attention. The group insists on a
selective approach that highlights
oppression, prioritizing gender and
leaving all other markers of identity
- race, religion, sexuality and class
- unnoticed on the backburner.
Even more unsettling, Femen's
calls for "Muslim women, unveil!"
summon images of colonized Alge-
ria, where French women regularly
staged public "unveiling ceremo-
nies" for Algerian women under the
cry of "Vive L'Algerie Francaise!"
Local norms, especially around
women's sartorial choices, were
used by colonists to justify subju-
gation. In order to progress and
"civilize" the indigenous,-Algerian
women were made to unveil so that
they could become "free" under
French occupation. Femen adopts a
similar tone where Muslim women
can only realize liberation through
the imposed aid of their white
European counterparts.
I'm tired of the trite Eurocentric
assumption that one's feminist cre-
dentials are reflected and validated
through choices of dress. Time
and again, mainstream Western
feminism has sought to dictate and

prescribe the concerns and needs
of other women without including
them in the conversation. By decid-
ing that the biggest challenges to
liberation are rooted in "culture,"
Femen dismisses the multiple ele-
phants in the room that stand in the
way of liberation.
Guess what, Femen? Challeng-
ing society's patriarchal norms is
on my daily agenda, but I'm just
as equally enraged with the rac-
ist, corporatist, global imperialist
structures that perpetuate patriar-
chy and wreck women's lives over
and over again - especially women
who look like me whom you claim
to be liberating. In fact, your efforts
don't support my sisters, but dis-
tract from the fearless organizing
they do every single day, even if you
actively choose to overlook it.
The feminism that I know isn't
one that denies the agency of
women or feeds off of explicitly rac-
ist tropes that infantilize women.
While I find Femen's approach
off-putting and regressive, I won't
allow this to have me second-guess
my commitment to various feminist
causes. Feminism, like most other
movements and ideologies, has
been used overtime to justify mili-
tarism, war, neoliberalism and col-
onization. Despite this, I'll continue
to advocate my own understanding
of feminism - one rooted in equali-
ty, humility and self-determination.
To my well-meaning saviors,
please understand that the misogy-
nistic, racist ordeals I experience
regularly aren't oppressions that
I can disentangle from one anoth-
er. In this sense, your bigoted,
exclusivist movement becomes an
additional battle and a burden to

surging back to life. "What did
you see, Jonesy?" a drunken Don
slurs days later, hoisted between
the arms of Pete Campbell (Vin-
cent Kartheiser) and Ken Cos-
grove (Aaron Staton). "When you
died - what did you see?"
Passageways - doors, eleva-
tors, windows, hallways - have
been recurring narrative and
framing mechanisms for "Mad
Men" since the beginning. In
this premiere - pointedly titled
"The Doorway" - Roger tells his
therapist, "You realize that's all
there are: doors, and windows,
and bridges and gates. And they
all open the same way. And they
all close behind you ... You're just
goingin a straight line toyou know

where."
There's that shadow of death
again, lurking in the corners of
passageways. For Don and Roger,
death never lingers too far behind
- it's a formative facet of both
characters. Sometimes it sneaks
up unexpectedly, like when Don
pitches his grand "jumping off
point" campaign to SCDP's latest
high-profile account, the Royal
Hawaiian Hotel. To Don, the
sketch of abandoned clothes and
footprints at the seaside repre-
sents shedding skin, becoming
someone new, just as he did when
he made the transformation from
Dick Whitman to Don Draper. To
the client - and everyone, really
- it looks like a suicide scene.
"Mad Men"has always excelled
in giving great meaning to.objects
and imagery, sometimes getting a
little too assertive in its explana-
tions (last season, we probably
didn't need someone to tell Don
that it's not his tooth that's rot-
ten to understand the symbolic
weight of an abscessed tooth). In
"The Doorway," the imagery is a
bit more delicate. An abandoned
violin becomes Betty's desire for
something that makes her spe-
cial, something that uplifts her
from the mundane life Sally's
perceptive-yet-naive (Sally: "She
thinks she's 25 because she uses
tampons") friend Sandy points
to with disgust. Don accidentally
takes the lighter of a soldier he
meets in Hawaii, which drums up
all sorts of weighted memories of
his time in Korea.
Plenty of callbacks to "Mad
Men" 's early years come up in

"The Doorway," some subtle,
like the Kodak Carousel Don and
Megan use to show their neigh-
bors pictures of their Hawaii get-
away - the time machine. But
nostalgia shouldn't be mistaken as
stasis: Though Roger insists in his
doorway soliloquy that nothing
really changes as life goes on, if he
were to step back and view things
from where we do, he'd see that's
far from the case. The most notice-
able change comes in the form of
Peggy Olsen (Elisabeth Moss). To
say she's a Don 2.0would be unfair
to the strength and depth of the
character, but it's hard not to think
ofher former boss when she effort-
lessly convinces a client she's right
and he's wrong and takes a well
aimed verbal punch at her copy-
writing underlings.
Last season, the clash of the
generations (the Dons and Rog-
ers vs. the Megans and Janes and
Freddys) picked up speed. Now,
it's in full acceleration. The copy-
writers have shaggy hair and style
that suggest the imminence of the
1970s, making clean-cut Don look
almost like a foreigner in his own
office, which has been rearranged
by photographers shooting pub-
licity stills for the company, much
to Don's annoyance. He's back
to his philandering ways, sleep-
ing with his new doctor friend's
wife despite his picture-perfect
life with Megan. Roger, too, tries
to hold onto the life he knows
despite the shifting tides around
him.
Meanwhile, the people around
them are going, well, through
"The Doorway," into 1968.

By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
Tippi Hedren has hardly
changed since her modeling
days 60 years ago. Star of Alfred
Hitchcock's "The Birds" and
"Marnie," the latter of which
was featured in a specialty
screening set up by Turner Clas-
sic.Movies at the Michigan The-
ater on April 9, Hedren exudes
the same delicate beauty and
refreshing directness that she
did when she became a star half
a century ago.
The Michigan Daily inter-
viewed Ben Mankiewicz, regu-
lar host for TCM, and Hedren,
who discussed the gravity of
film appreciation and her com-
plex relationship with the
eponymous Hitchcock with the
same level, refined voice that she
so eerily used to play psycho-
logically dysfunctional Marnie.
She said this character was her
favorite and most rewarding
role.
"I felt so fortunate in being
able to do this film because it was
such a groundbreaking story at
the time," Hedren said. "With-
out the story you have nothing.
You can have the best producers,
the best actors, the best direc-
tors, but if you don't have a story,
you have nothing."
The film was advertised as
"Alfred Hitchcock's suspense
sex mystery," and it follows
Marnie, an intensely disturbed
woman - a calculating thief and
compulsive liar - as her tragic
past is uncovered by her beguil-
ing boss Mark Rutland, played
with dark humor by Sean Con-
nery.
"Actresses in Hollywood
knew that this was a compli-
cated leading lady, a leading
lady with a whole lot of depth,"
Mankiewicz said. "You knew
she was messed up, but there
was a full sort of range, a fully
human character, which I think
was rare at the time."
Although the film was not
well received at the time, since
its release it has been hailed
as an innovative look into the
effects of traumatic incidents
during childhood on a person's
psyche.
"All those years ago, nobody
realized that what happens to
a child traumatically can have
such an effect later on in life,"
Hedren said. "It wasn't a big film
when it came out because people
didn't understand it, but I read
the book over and over again,
I talked to psychiatrists about
this issue ... It was really kind of
a wonderful (thing) to have hap-
pen, to be able to play that role."
Hedren wasn't the obvi-
ous choice for this role; a host
of famous actresses, including
Grace Kelly, vied for the part of
Marnie. As a model and com-
mercial actress, Hedren lacked*
any dramatic experience, but
Hitchcock became enamored
with her during one of her com-
mercials and decided to sign this
beauty without ever having met
her.
The signing of a seven-year
contract between Hedren and
Hitchcock began a tumultu-
ous and abusive working rela-
tionship that effectively ruined
Hedren's promising career, and
revealed the film master's dark-
er side.

A book lover visits Literati

By TEHREEM SAJJAD
Daily Arts Writer
I rememberwhenmy7-year-old
self would spend hours maneu-
vering through the aisles in the
children's section of the library,
surfing through the collection
of "Junie B. Jones," "Magic Tree
House" and "Diary of a Wimpy
Kid" books, gathering the ones I
wanted and ultimately carrying
the stack to my mom to take them
home.
As a child, it was the anticipa-
tion of flipping through the pages
of a book, taking quick glances at
the forthcoming pictures and the
growing excitement and desire to
reach that particular place in the
plot.
As a teenager, it was the words,
rather than the pictures, that
amplified my exhilaration. I can
still recall the nights when I would
stay awake long after midnight,
turning the pages of a "Harry Pot-
ter" book - fully immersed in J.K.
Rowling's magical world - and
painfully longing to be a part of it.
Though it has been only a few
years since then, I see more people
reading books on their iPads, Kin-
dles and other devices. Sometimes,
I feel like every such instance
serves to remind me that this is the
era of the e-book.
With technological advance-
ment, including the expansive
reach of the Internet and mobile
applications, e-books are slowly
crushing the publishing industry.

'Evil Dead' resurrected

Meatless

Activists strive to
reduce national
meat consumption
By CARLINA DUAN
DailyArts Writer
On April 8, a group of stu-
dent activists stood at the corner
of South University, passing out
samples of local vegetarian food,
citing facts on the meat industry
of the country and advocating
for a campus-wide change in the
form of Meatless Mondays. The
student group, part of an Organi-
zational Studies activism class at
the University, is part of a larger
movement of nationwide organiz-
ers attempting to reduce the meat
consumption in schools in order
to promote healthy, sustainable
and environmentally aware stu-
dent populations.
Meatless Mondays, a national
nonprofit initiative, attempts to
reduce national meat consump-
tion every Monday. In dining halls
across U.S. campuses, meat-based
meals are replaced with "healthy,
environmentally friendly meat-
free alternatives," according to
the national Meatless Mondays
website. The program, currently
enforced by over 140 colleges
and almost 100 K-12 school dis-
tricts across the country, has yet
to reach the University campus.
If established at the University,
the plan would involve reducing
meat-based meals every Monday
intwo dininghalls: EastQuad and
North Quad, for the 2013-2014
school year.
LSA Sophomore Alex Winnick,
one of the students involved in
Meatless Mondays, described the
movement.

Pitching powers Wolverine streak

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
Drawing on motivation from
other Michigan athletic teams as
well as an injured teammate, the
Michigan baseball team will seek
to extend its current winning
streak to seven.
The Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten,
17-14 overall)
will take on
Penn State i
a three-game at Michigan
series this Matchup:
weekend. The Penn State

which made an
improbable run to the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. last
year.
"For us, it's not really about
them, it's about us," said Michi-
gan coach Erik Bakich. "We're
going to continue our style of
play, and if we play to our poten-
tial, and not down to the oppo-
nent, then we should be able to
take care of baseball."
The Wolverines' style of play
has been effective as of late, as
this current winning streak is the
team's longest since 2010. Michi-
gan started its streak last week
by dispatching two opponents in
mid-week games before sweep-
ing in-state rival Michigan State.
The Wolverines followed that up
by defeating No. 18 Notre Dame
this past Tuesday, 4-1.
The pitching staff, led by
freshman Evan Hill, redshirt
junior Logan McAnallen and
sophomore Trent Szkutnik, has

from first-inning runs en route to
victories.
"(Freshman infielder Travis)
Maezes leads off the Saturday
game with a triple, and he's fired
up, he almost knocks me out
when he slides in because he's so
fired up," said Bakich, who is also
the third-base coach. "In game
three, (sophomore outfielder)
Zach Zott hits a two-out, two-
run absolute bomb for two runs
in the first inning."
Zott has wielded a hot bat
recently for the Wolverines. In
eight of his last 11 games, he has
had at least two hits. On the sea-
son, he carries a .329 average
with a .447 slugging percentage.
Forcing Penn State to use its
bullpen will be an important fac-
torthisweekend. Opponentshave
scored a majority of their runs
against the Nittany Lions in the
later innings when their starters
are no longer in the game.
On Friday, Michigan will face
redshirt sophomore T.J. Jann,
who has appeared in seven games
this year and has held opposing
teams to a batting average of .235.
After complications from Tommy
John surgery in 2011, Jann was
told by doctors that his baseball
career could be over. After more
than two years of rehab, Jann has
been pitching solid as of late. In
his most recent outing against
Wright State, Jann pitched 7.1
innings while only giving up
three runs.
If Michigan continues its hot
play, it should be in great posi-
tion to not only win the series
but to potentially get back-to-
back sweeps. If the Wolverines
do, they'll continue to add to the
recent success of Michigan ath-
letics, something not lost on the
players or the coaching staff.
"These guys just want to con-
tribute to the winning tradition
and to the winning ways," Bakich
said. "That's what we're going to
keep on doing."

Sophomore Trent Szkutnik has been a big part of Michigan's six-game winning streak. Szkutnik is 3-4 with a 3.95 earned-run average in nine appearances Ibis season.

been a big reason for Michigan's
recent run. The staff has allowed
just seven runs over the past six
games. i
Monday, Hill was named the
Big Ten Freshman of the Week
for his performance against
Michigan State. In eight innings
of work, Hill gave up four hits,
struck out four and allowed only
one unearned run. The award is
the third in Hill's short career
- the others coming after his
performances against Western
Illinois and Saint Louis earlier
this year.
"Our entire pitching staff has
really pitched terrific, with great

tempo and just pounding the
zone," Bakich said. "And a big
part of it is having Pat Biondi back
in the lineup. He is ajackrabbit in
centerfield and he catches every-
thing."
While Michigan got Biondi,
a senior, back from injury, the
Wolverines lost fellow senior Ben
Ballantine to an ankle injury sus-
tained last week. A member of the
team's leadership council, Bal-
lantine was a starter for Michi-
gan and had a 2.62 earned-run
average in seven games. Ballan-
tine underwent season-ending
surgery on his ankle Tuesday.
Although Ballantine was unable

to attend Tuesday's game, he was
still represented by teammates,
who hung his jersey up in the
dugout during the game.
"Ben Ballantine's injury has
meant a lot to this group," Bakich
said. "They are really motivated
to make sure we continue to play
our butts off and do it for Ben."
Without Ballantine, Michigan
will likely stick with a three-
man rotation consisting of all
left-handers. Out of the bullpen,
the Wolverines will continue to
utilize senior right-hander Kyle
Clark, sophomore right-hander
Matt Ogden and freshman right-
hander Jacob Cronenworth as

they have all season.
The Nittany Lions have some
offensive weapons with the
potential to hurt the Wolverines.
Penn State's top three hitters
are batting above .300 and have
gap power. The three hitters, all
righties, have matchup advan-
tages against Michigan's lefty
pitchers.
Another key for Michigan will
be continuing to get off to good
starts offensively. In four of the
games in the winning streak, the
Wolverines have taken the early
lead by scoring in the first inning.

each other all too well. In fact,

In the first game of the series,
the Wolverines will look to

Michigan State has looked
strong so far, currently in sec-

Spartans were perfect in the Big
Ten until last weekend, when
they dropped a game to Purdue.
This is a huge turnaround
from last. season, when they
went winless against conference
opponents and didn't beat any-
one in East Lansing. Head coach
Jacquie Joseph has already
responded by nearly doubling
her team's win total from last

Freshman shortstop Sierra

Romero is an anchor for the
Wolverines' offense and has
been recognized accordingly.
After the series with Ohio State,
she was named Big Ten Fresh-

straight week and the fifth time
this season. She also picked up
her second Player of the Week
award, leading to her being
named one of USA Softball's 25
finalists for the Collegiate Soft-
ball Player of the Year. She's one
of two freshmen to make the list
and one of two Big Ten players
named.
To come away with three wins
this weekend, Michigan will
have to keep outfielder Kylene

was an All-Big Ten first-team
outfielder in 2012 and has led
the Michigan State offense with
a .426 batting average, 46 home
runs and a.512 on-base percent-
age. They will also have to get
hits off junior Kelly Smith, who
has developed into an ace for the
Spartans, throwing 186 strike-
outs in 150.2 innings for a 16-7
record on the season.
After the first game in Ann
Arbor, the teams will compete
on Saturday and Sunday in
East Lansing for games 105 and
106 between the two schools.
Ohio State and Minnesota are
the only other two schools that
Michigan has played 100 times
or more.

Five things to watch in Spring ame

ByZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
This much is certain: the interior of
the Michigan football team's offensive
line will wear facial hair and eat break-
fasts at Benny's Family Dining in Ann
Arbor. That leaves, well,just about every-
one as options.
After a disappointing season on the
ground in 2012, the Wolverines will
unveil a new, and likely very young, inte-
rior line at Saturday's Spring Game. Any
of the three eventual starters, in all like-
lihood, will see their first game action in
the fall.
This spring, the offensive linemen
have grown facial hair as ateam-building
exercise. Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner often takes the group out.
to breakfast.
The hope is that the closer the group
is, the better it willbe. Aside from former
quarterback Denard Robinson, Michi-
gan's backsstruggled to gain much on the
ground last year. Then-redshirt sopho-
more Fitzgerald Toussaint didn't do
much to create his own space, but often,
he had no holes to choose from.
Redshirt freshman guard Kyle Kalis
should be a near-lock to start at guard. At
center, redshirt sophomore Jack Miller
will likely get the start.
The real competition is at the other
guard position, between redshirt sopho-
more Chris Bryant and redshirt fresh-

man Ben Braden. Freshmen Kyle Bosch
and Patrick Kugler could challenge for
the starting spot, but the transition from
high school to Division Ilineman is a very
slow process. Bosch has the advantage of
enrollingearlybuthe remains alongshot.
Bryant had a promising future until
tearing his anterior cruciate ligament
prior to last season and could have an edge
over the freshmen. The 6-foot-6, 314-
pound Braden has the most impressive
frame, and likely would've challenged for
the starting tackle position had fifth-year
senior tackle Taylor Lewan gone pro. But
can he translate that to guard?
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has
recruited the line heavily, and that should
start paying off in 2013.
WANNA SEE IF YOU CAN RUN IT,
RUN IT: The competition at running back
could be the top story line of the Spring
Game, if only the top two competitors
were playing. After a regression at tail-
back in 2012, the position this year is even
more uncertain.
Toussaint hasn't returned to full-con-
tact drills after fracturing his leg on Nov.
17. Derrick Green, perhaps Hoke's most
highly-touted recruit, remains in high
school.
Neither promises a return to the
ground-game success of 2011 immediate-
ly. Yet the rest of the field hasn't exactly
seized the opportunity. Hoke has praised
the remaining backs - junior Thom-
as Rawls, redshirt sophomore Justice

Hayes, sophomore Dennis Norfleet and
redshirt freshman Drake Johnson - yet
no one has separated.
And the praise isn't exactly rousing.
"Justice has really done a nice job," Hoke
said after practice on April 4. "Thomas,
too."
Dennis Norfleet, on the other hand,
has run well inside "in spots."
Michigan ranked fifth in the Big Ten.
in rushing with 2,389 yards in 2012, but
more than half of those yards came from
Robinson. If no one impresses in the
Spring Game, Michigan fans better start
hoping Green is as good as advertised and
Toussaint's leg heals soon.
BETTER WATCH YOUR (QUARTER)
BACK: Speaking of less-than-high praise,
here's Hoke on quarterback Brian Cleary.
"Has a good arm," Hoke said. "I'm not
going to say he's throwing bullets, but
he's got a good arm, good accuracy."
Yes, that's Brian Cleary, a non-scholar-
ship redshirt freshman and the current
backup to the most important position
on the team. The former backup, redshirt
sophomore Russell Bellomy, tore his ACL
earlier this spring. And here is where the
previous two story lines converge. The
development of the interior line is so
important because Gardner needs all the
protection he can get. Finding a power
back is crucial to take the heat off Gard-
ner.
Yet even if the linemen exceed expec-
tations and a running game emerges,

Gardner will likely get dinged up here
and there. If Cleary becomes a service-
able backup, Michigan can redshirt
incoming freshman Shane Morris.
Cleary's first chance to show the public
his worth comes Saturday.
LOOK OUT FOR CLARK: The Wolver-
ines' last impact pass rusher left after
2009. His name was Brandon Graham,
and Michigan hasn't had a player like
him since.
Enter Frank Clark. The junior defen-
sive end has a long, long way to go to
attain Graham status, but he has earned
the highest praise of any single player
this spring.
Hoke said Clark is "unusual," noting
that "Frank has an ability, a God-given
ability."
Defensive coordinator Greg Mattison
said that Clark "thinks about football day
and night."
Lewan named Clark as the player he
least likes to see in one-on-one drills.
Clark said that he lines up against Lewan
20 times per day, calling ittheir "project"
to go against each other as much as pos-
sible.
Even last year, the matchup would
have been one-sided. Clark showed
improvement throughout the 2012 sea-
son after beingsuspended for the opener.
He finished with 9.5 tackles for loss, two
sacks and a forced fumble. When left
unblocked, he hit people, and hard.
Yet he had to fight for playing time.

This year, Clark has beefed up to 274
pounds, up about 50 pounds from his
freshman year.
Clark still has a lot to prove, but he's
the most likely to turn heads on the end. S
LAST OF THE RECEIVERS: Gardner's
favorite target, fifth-year senior Jeremy
Gallon, exploded late last season.. The
diminutive wideout blossomed into a via-
ble threat. But take a good look Saturday,
he's likely the last of a dying breed.
Smaller receivers like Gallon fit in for- *
mer Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez's
spread offense. But the offense of Hoke
and offensive coordinator Al Borges
favors a more traditional look with bigger
receivers.
Meet the pass-catching future: 6-foot-
2, 213-pound sophomore Amara Darboh
and 6-foot-3, 193-pound redshirt fresh-
man Jehu Chesson.
Chesson, Borges said, has speed. Dar-
boh is more elusive.
Both are big.
The current offense features Gallon
(5-foot-8) and Drew Dileo (5-foot-10).
Roy Roundtree, last year's No. 1 receiver,
stood at 6-feet tall.
"We wanted to get some bigger kids in
there, knowing that the little guys have
done a great job for us, but we did want to
give a little more range to the position,"
Borges said.
"We've won a few jump balls," Borges
continued, then paused. "Lost a few, but
haven't lost them all."
