As 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students began school two weeks 
ago, approximately 30 international 
students were unable to matriculate 
because of delays in their United 
States visa applications, according 
to University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen.
The three students interviewed in 
this article all requested anonymity 
due to fear of retaliation from the 
United States Department of State. 

Other identifying information, such 
as the students’ undergraduate 
institutions and programs of study 
at the University, will also not be 
disclosed.
The students interviewed, who 
are referred to as John, Sue and 
Bob in this article, described poor 
communication 
from 
the 
State 
Department and uncertainty for 
their futures in separate interviews 
with The Daily. 
The University’s International 
Center is aware of approximently 30 
students who could not begin classes 
in Ann Arbor because of delays in 

processing and approving visas from 
the State Department, Broekhuizen 
wrote in an email to The Daily. She 
noted the majority of the students 
affected were enrolled in graduate 
programs at the University.
Foreign policy under the Trump 
administration has led to a sharp 
increase in visa delays and denials, 
according to an article published in 
the New York Times in August.
In an email to The Daily, a State 
Department spokesperson noted 74 
percent of student visa applications 
globally were approved in the 2018 
fiscal year. The spokesperson said 

the department’s top priority when 
reviewing applicants was national 
security, which was the cause of any 
increased vetting.
“While some campuses may 
report delays, we have also heard 
anecdotally that there is variation 
in what different campuses are 
experiencing,” 
the 
spokesperson 
wrote.
The three students interviewed 
all said their applications were put 
through administrative processing, 
which has been likened to an 
elongated security check.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In order to commemorate 
Constitution Day, the University 
of Michigan invited Rep. Justin 
Amash, I-Mich, to speak. The 
former 
undergraduate 
and 
Michigan law alum represents 
Michigan’s 3rd District. While 
the first half of the lecture largely 
centered around how Amash’s 
philosophy as a public servant 
centers around the powers of 
the constitution, he also spoke 

about political theatrics and the 
grim side of Congress.
The 
conversation 
was 
moderated by Richard Primus, 
a Theodore J. St. Antoine 
Collegiate Professor of Law. 
Primus, who has previously 
clerked 
for 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
acknowledged 
that 
while 
he 
differs 
with 
Amash 
ideologically, he values their 
political discourse.
“We disagree on things like 
taxation, 
health 
insurance, 

foreign policy,” Primus said. “We 
disagree in the constitutional 
realm about things like from 
the proper allocation of power 
among the federal government 
to 
the 
states. 
And 
these 
disagreements 
matter. 
They 
matter a lot. If Mr. Amash 
didn’t think they mattered, he 
wouldn’t be in public life. But 
when I talk with him about 
Constitutional law, I know that 
I am talking to someone who 
has a deep commitment to be 
principled in the conversation 

and to act upon the principles he 
arrives at.”
Primus used to be Amash’s 
Common Law professor and 
fondly 
recounts 
teaching 
Amash. He remembers Amash 
always having deep reverence 
for the Constitution. 
“Mr. Amash sat, I think fourth 
row, and in the middle,” Primus 
said. “Almost in the center of the 
group. This spatially was not a 
reflection of his place in politics. 

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council discussed a variety 
of legislative issues facing 
the community, ranging from 
zoning laws to policing to 
marijuana licensing, at their 
meeting Monday evening. 
To 
start 
the 
meeting, 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
acknowledged September as 
National Recovery Month. He 
gave two recovering addicts 
a chance to testify to the 
wealth of addiction recovery 
resources in the Ann Arbor 
area, including the Dawn Farm 
outpatient and detoxification 
programs. 
Sam, 
seven 
years 
clean, 
commended 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
recovery resources. 
“This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
more 
supportive 
recovery 
communities that I have been a 
part of,” Sam said. “I have never 
been to a place that had such 
a celebration of recovery and 
professional 
opportunities... 
where I can stand up in a City 
Council meeting and declare 
that I am in recovery.”
The council then moved 
forward 
with 
a 
resolution 
approving a purchase order of 
new police body cameras to be

afternoon 
in 
the 
Fleming 
Administrative 
Building 
to 
discuss the Big Ten Academic 
Alliance, which will be held 
this year at the University of 
Michigan starting on Oct. 17.
The BTAA, which is a yearly 
consortium of the 14 Big Ten

for 
three days to discuss research, 
academics, university resources 
and faculty governance.
SACUA 
Chair 
Joy 
Beatty 
led 
the 
discussion 
Monday, 
and 
faculty 
representatives 
suggested potential talks and 
panels at the three-day meeting 
next month. The conference 
tends to be attended by several 
faculty 
representatives 
from 
each Big Ten university, Beatty 
said. 
“BTAA is all the heads of 
faculty senate from Big Ten 
schools, so the chair of faculty 
senate, the vice chair of faculty 
senate and any staff members 
they want to bring,” she said. 
“It’s actually kind of a small

Rackham Graduate School 
hosted a town hall to garner 
graduate 
student 
feedback 
about a Blue Ribbon Panel 
report on Monday. The report 
addressed the question put 
forth by University Provost 
Martin A. Philbert: “What 
ought to be the intersection 
between 
political 
thought/
ideology and a faculty member’s 
responsibility to students?” The 
question and report followed 
last fall’s controversy of faculty 
rescinding 
recommendation 
letters 
for 
study 
abroad 
programs held in Israel and 
the University’s sanctions in 
response. 
Sociology 
professor 
Sandra Levitsky opened the 
town hall by summarizing 
the 
recommendation 
letter 
rescindment 
and 
sanctions 
controversy and why the Blue 
Ribbon Panel was created. 
“What the controversy really 
revealed is that the University 
of Michigan actually has no 
policy in place that governs 
situations of this kind that 

could offer clear guidance 
about what to do in this type 
of situation,” Levitsky said. 
“What should we do when a 
faculty acting on his or her 
perceived freedom of political 
thought conflicts with the 
freedom of another person? 
What should we do when the 
exercise of faculty freedom of 
thought conflicts with faculty 
responsibilities to students?”
After 
gathering 
feedback 
from 
over 
1,100 
students 
through an anonymous form 
and holding four two-hour 
listening sessions at University 
campuses, the panel published 
its report on March 21, 2019 
which included a Statement 
of Principle, stating faculty-
student interactions “must be 
based solely on educational 
and 
professional 
reasons.” 
Levitsky explained that faculty 
need relevant and appropriate 
reasons to decline students 
letters 
of 
recommendations 
or research and lab work. 
Additionally, faculty should 
not treat students differently 
if they share or do not share 
similar political ideologies.

City representatives 
speak on cannabis 
permits, zoning laws 
and police cameras


Several 
state 
lawmakers 
introduced a new expungement 
reform plan package on Sept. 
9. 
The 
package 
includes 
six separate bills aimed at 
changing 
various 
aspects 
of the state’s expungement 
system. Expungement refers 
to the legal process of sealing 
a past criminal offence to 
make them unavailable. 
If passed, the bills would 
allow for a shortened eligibility 
period, 
expungement 
for 
crimes 
that 
are 
currently 
permissible under current law, 
coverage of a wider range of 
offenses and more.
According to one of the 
package’s sponsors, state Rep. 
Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
issues exist with the current 
expungement system. 

“Once someone has been 
convicted of a misdemeanor 
or a felony and they have 
served 
their 
time, 
their 
crimes 
are 
still 
on 
their 
record which is something 
that prevents people, often, 
from 
getting 
employment 
or 
housing 
opportunities,” 
Rabhi said. “So, making sure 
people have a clean slate once 
they’ve paid their debt to 
society is important so that 
we 
can 
reduce 
recidivism 
and the amount of folks that 
are becoming reincarcerated 
because 
they 
can’t 
find 
employment or housing.”
According to Rabhi, much 
of the bill puts a focus on 
marijuana-related 
charges. 
This comes after the passage of 
Proposition 1 last year, making 
recreational 
marijuana 
use 
legal in the state of Michigan.
“We’ve specifically tried 

to address marijuana related 
crimes that are legal under 
current law and allowing those 
expungements to be expedited 
as well,” Rabhi said. “Again, 
this package doesn’t go as far 
as it could, but this is a serious 
step in the right direction, and 
it’s going farther than most 
states in the country are.”
According 
to 
LSA 
senior 
Eric 
TerBush, 
who 
contributes cannabis content 
to 
Detroit-based 
financial 
news organization Benzinga, 
creating 
a 
strong, 
all-
encompassing 
system 
for 
cannabis, including criminal 
justice 
reform, 
happens 
incrementally.
“We 
didn’t 
get 
to 
recreational 
cannabis 
overnight, 
we 
didn’t 
get 
to a wide medical system 
overnight,” TerBush said. “It 
was small steps forward on 
the hard work of a lot 
of people who are very 
passionate, 
and 
don’t 
imagine 
expungement 
will be any different 
than that same hard 
work by those people 
stepping forward.” 
Hannah Agnew, LSA 
senior and president of 
the Student Executive 
Committee 
for 
the 
Prison 
Creative 
Arts 
Project, said while the 
package is a good start 
for 
tackling 
criminal 
justice reform, there is 
more work to be done.
“I’m 
definitely 
hopeful,” Agnew said. 
“It’s really important to 
be looking at disparities 
in drug laws, especially 
because 
there 
are 
so 
many 
folks 
that 
are 
incarcerated 
on 
minor drug laws. That 
shouldn’t 
take 
away 
from the fact that mass 
incarceration 
is 
also 
affecting 
people 
with 
more serious laws, and 
it’s not just people with 

those minor drug offenses 
that we should be looking at.”
Rabhi 
said 
the 
disproportionate 
nature 
of 
drug-related 
convictions 
makes 
expungement 
an 
economic inequality issue.
“If you have the resources 
to hire an attorney and work 
through the legal process, 
once 
you’re 
eligible 
for 
expungement, it’s easy to get 
your record expunged,” Rabhi 
said. “But for the vast majority 
of Michiganders that don’t 
have access to those resources, 
it’s a financial burden.”
TerBush said one concern 
he 
has 
about 
automatic 
expungement is that many 
marijuana 
convictions 
may 
not tell the whole story of the 
case.
“Something 
I’ve 
learned 
working with legislators is 
that a lot of the times in iffy 
cases, say, violent crime with 
possession, people who can 
will plead down to, say, felony 
possession,” 
TerBush 
said. 
“My only concern with an 
automatic expungement would 
be those people who might, 
for lack of a better phrase, slip 
through the cracks. Not that 
right now there’s a current 
system to really accommodate 
for that disparity, but my 
only concern would be actual 
dangerous people getting a 
clean slate completely.”
Rabhi said he was excited 
to see bipartisan support and 
collaboration for the package.
“We’re in a very unique 
time right now in the state of 
Michigan where Democrats 
have 
been 
pushing 
for 
criminal justice reforms for 
many years, but we finally 
have a Republican caucus 
where there is an appetite 
for looking at these types of 
reforms,” Rabhi said. “I’m 
really excited to be working in 
a bipartisan way with some of 
my Republican colleagues to 
push some of these initiatives 
forward.”

Inc. 
City Councilmember Kathy 
Griswold, D-Ward 2, pointed 
to the benefits of equipping the 
city’s police force with more 
state-of-the-art accountability 
technology. 
“I am absolutely thrilled we 
are moving forward with this 
purchase,” Griswold said. “My 
one question is, this is a five-
year contract — will this see 
enough money and does the 
contract stipulate that we are 

going to have fully functioning 
body cams for the full length of 
the five years so that we don’t 
have the problem that we face 
right now?” 
Taylor 
later 
brought 
the council’s focus to the 
expansion of legal access to 
marijuana in the city. Members 
of 
the 
council 
expressed 
considerable 
disagreement 
about 
the 
flexibility 
and 
general size of the limit on the 
number of medical marijuana 
permits in the city.
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2, said she was 
concerned about not having 
enough time to approve new 
ordinances 
expanding 
the 

amount of permits for medical 
marijuana facilities in the city.
“I think it’s too much to digest 
in too short a time,” Lumm 
said. “The council did not have 
our normal opportunity to ask 
questions; our questions have 
to be submitted by noon on 
Wednesday. We received this 
late, at the end of the day on 
Friday.” 
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, said some 
constituents indicated concern 
about 
the 
large 
amount 
of 
marijuana 
investment 
potentially overwhelming the 
city and crowding out small 
businesses 
offering 
other 
goods. 

“I’m suggesting that we put 
a limit on this and … we can 
always come back and change 
it,” Hayner said.
But 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, voiced a 
general 
skepticism 
towards 
creating inflexible types of 
limits on the amount of medical 
marijuana permits offered.
“Maybe 
you 
want 
more 
safety compliance facilities … 
or you need fewer growers or 
more processors … the straight-
across 
three-dozen 
(limit) 
under 
all 
these 
categories 
I think is too inhibitive,” 
Ramlawi said.

VISA
From Page 1

Students said this processing 
lengthened the application process 
and kept them from attending the 
University this semester.
Students 
interviewed 
also 
pointed to the trade war between 
China and the United States as 
a possible factor in influencing 
their delays as students from 
various areas of China. The trade 
war has had a noticeable impact 
on oil prices and imports from 
China, and it has left students 
accepted to U.S. institutions 
unable to begin their studies as 
the world’s two largest economies 
face off.
A 
confusing 
application 
process
John came to his visa interview 
ready to tell his interviewer 
about the program he planned to 
attend in the University’s College 
of Engineering, but he was only 
asked about its geographical 
location and prior leadership 
experience. Three months later, 
after what he felt was an unusually 
short interview, he remains on 
administrative processing — or a 
“check,” as he and other Chinese 
students commonly refer to the 
heightened background check.
“I feel confused,” he said. 
“I heard about administrative 
processing. In China, we call it a 
‘check’ because it’s a process for 
checking your background.”
The delay has also created 
difficulties 
for 
his 
program 
coordinator at the University, 
who he noted has been helpful 
throughout this process. John 
is 
specifically 
interested 
in 
studying in the U.S. because of its 
advanced technology.
John 
said 
he 
and 
other 
students in similar situations 
have attempted to contact the 
State 
Department, 
but 
have 
consistently 
been 
met 
with 
surface-level responses. He said 
he feels frustrated with the lack 
of communication from the U.S. 
government, even if it is for noble 
reasons.
“We send some emails to the 
(State Department) office, but 
we just receive some template,” 
he said. “What I want to know 
is why this processing is really, 
really long ... I can accept it if it’s 
related to national security, but I 
think that I need a reason.”
Additionally, he noted the 
trade war may be a reason for his 
delay. John said the relationship 
between China and America has 
only recently become hostile and 
is hopeful it can be rectified in 
the near future.
“If we consider the long period 
of relationship between China 
and America, I think peace is the 
main part of that,” he said. “The 
tradewar is just a fluctuation — a 
short period. Unfortunately, we 
made it and we are influenced by 
it.”
John is optimistic he will 
have a visa before the Winter 
2020 semester begins. In the 
meantime, he is looking for jobs 
related to his program of study in 
China.
While he said he felt worried 
when he first received the news of 
the delay, John said finding other 
opportunities to fill what would 
have been his first semester of 
graduate school has kept his 
mind focused elsewhere.
“At first, (I felt) anxiety and 
felt nervous, but after a long time, 
you feel calm and prepare for 
other things to fill this period,” 
John said. “For now, we just need 
a strong mind to solve it and to 
deal with it by ourselves.”
Feeling left behind
Sue 
said 
she 
underwent 
intense 
preparation 
before 
applying to the University for 
her master’s degree, even hiring 
a service to help her prepare for 

her visa interview. She turned in 
all materials necessary to apply 
for her visa 120 days in advance 
to ensure there would be no 
issues, she told The Daily. 
During 
her 
application 
interview, Sue said she was asked 
basic 
information 
about 
the 
program she planned to enroll 
at the University. After sharing 
her plan, the interviewer told Sue 
there would be a check on her visa 
application and she would have to 
wait for it to be approved before 
coming to the United States.
“I thought it would be fine,” 
Sue said. “But I didn’t realize 
that there would be something 
about the abnormal delay of the 
delivered check … I can’t get the 
education and program now.”
When Sue learned her visa 
application had been delayed, she 
contacted the Chinese embassy 
by email and the United States 
State Department by telephone. 
Like John, Sue said she received 
template responses back that 
were not relevant to her specific 
case.
Sue 
said 
the 
University 
provided comforting responses 
and acknowledged the issue 
stems from the government and 
not the University. 
“The responses from them 
did not focus on my case, they 
just replied to everyone with the 
same situation, responded with 
the same content,” Sue said. “I 
also contacted the University, but 
I don’t think the International 
Center can do something about 
this.”
Following her delayed visa, 
Sue made the decision to continue 
to pursue her master’s degree 
at a school in China while she 
awaits a decision from the State 
Department.
Sue said she longed to receive 
an education in the culture of 
U.S. classrooms. She planned to 
continue into a Ph.D. program in 
the United States after finishing 
her master’s at the University, but 
her education and career plans 
have now drastically changed. 
“Why I chose to (apply to 
Michigan) is because I disliked 
the environment in China, so 
I hope to change (my learning 
environment),” Sue said. “But if 
I can’t, I may have to stay here, 
although I feel unsatisfied with 
that.”
Sue’s situation also had a 
serious impact on her social 
interactions. 
She 
chose 
to 
delete WeChat, a popular social 
networking 
application 
in 
China, to avoid talking about her 
circumstances. Now, Sue feels 
left behind and unsure of what 
her future holds. She said she 
feels embarrassed by the delay, 
even though it’s out of her hands.
“I chose to lose contact with 
my friends,” Sue said. “I changed 
my 
WeChat 
social 
network 
because I just don’t want to tell 
them my situation. And I don’t 
want to always see some friends 
go abroad or to go to another 
state and go live the life that I 
really wanted to live. So it makes 
me feel very lonely. Now, I don’t 
want to face (my) situation.”
Unable to return
Bob completed his bachelor’s 
degree at a university in China 
and his master’s degree at a 
university in the United States. 
He looked forward to continuing 
his education through a Ph.D. 
program at Michigan, but during 
his visa interview in June — three 
days after he returned to China 
from his master’s program in the 
U.S. — Bob learned his visa was 
delayed.
“I’m very frustrated,” Bob said. 
“I spent so much effort and put 
all my enthusiasm in the Ph.D. 
application. And after several 
months of waiting, I apply for the 
visa, but the United States doesn’t 
allow me to enter this state to 
receive my education. It’s really 

frustrating and disappointing.”
After learning of his delayed 
visa, Bob said he contacted Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, 
who he said told him she would 
be unable to help because he is 
not an Ann Arbor resident.
Dingell’s 
spokeswoman, 
Maggie Rousseau, wrote in an 
email to The Daily that Dingell 
and her office try to help every 
person 
that 
calls 
needing 
assistance navigating the visa 
application process. 
“In recent years, it has been 
made 
very 
difficult 
by 
the 
Administration’s tightening of 
applications,” Rousseau wrote. 
“Mrs. Dingell has made it clear 
she will go to bat for any students 
having visa problems. She has 
spoken to the University about 
bringing cases to our attention 
that need assistance navigating 
the complicated process.”
Bob 
also 
contacted 
the 
University’s program coordinator 
and the international office at 
Rackham Graduate School. They 
were also unable to help as the 
visa process is handled by the 
Department of State.
When previously applying for 
his visa to earn his master’s in the 
United States about a year and a 
half ago, Bob said his application 
underwent a short administrative 
process and was approved in one 
month. That visa was only valid 
for one year, though. 
“This is part of a problem 
because the program we are going 
to receive is usually longer than 
one year, but the visa is only valid 
for one year,” Bob said. “After 
the visa expires, we cannot go 
out of the United States and can’t 
come back, which means that we 
cannot attend the international 
conference, we cannot go back to 
our country and reunite with our 
families. That limits our access to 
many resources.”
Like John and Sue, Bob 
remains optimistic his visa will 
be approved before the beginning 
of the Winter 2020 semester. He 
said he has been in contact with 
the professor that he would 
be doing research with at the 
University since March.
“The professor and me are 
very excited for the future 
research, and we have been on 
Skype meetings,” Bob said. “But 
because of this visa issue, we 
are all very disappointed and we 
have to wait with it for another 
three months to start our new 
research.”
If the visa situation remains 
the same, Bob said he may decide 
to continue his studies at a 
Chinese university. Because his 
family lives in China, Bob said it 
would be easier to visit them than 
if he was studying in the United 
States.
Bob said he’s received cookie-
cutter responses from the State 
Department similar to those 
John and Sue described. He said 
the State Department sent a 
formal and unhelpful reply that 
explained 
the 
administrative 
process would take 120 days 
about 95 days ago.
“I think this issue is not 
beneficial for anyone — not for 
the United States, not for China, 
not for students, not for the 
University,” Bob said. “I really 
don’t 
understand 
(it). 
There 
are many disadvantages for us, 
as we delay our education and 
research.”
Delay impacts
In 
February, 
the 
State 
Department 
extended 
the 
timeline 
for 
administrative 
processing 
from 
30 
to 
180 
days. The State Department 
spokesperson emphasized the 
department’s focus on security 
while 
also 
acknowledging 
the department respects the 
timelines of applicants in an 
email to The Daily. 
“National security is our top 

priority when adjudicating visa 
applications,” the spokesperson 
wrote. “Every visa decision is 
a national security decision, 
and every prospective traveler 
to the United States undergoes 
extensive security screening. At 
the same time, we’re committed 
to providing the highest quality 
service to legitimate travelers - 
who constitute the overwhelming 
majority of our visa applicants 
- so they can receive swift, 
thorough, and clear decisions 
regarding their visa application.”
There has been a decline in the 
number of visas administered in 
recent years, from over 644,000 
students on the F1 academic 
visa in 2015 to approximately 
362,000 in 2018. In the last 
decade, the number of Chinese 
students studying in the U.S. has 
quadrupled to a high of more 
than 360,000. More than one 
million international students 
are currently studying in the U.S.
According 
to 
Broekhuizen, 
the University has not been 
impacted 
as 
drastically 
as 
other institutions. While the 
University has no control over 
administrative processing, she 
also noted affected students do 
have access to the University’s 
Student Legal Services, though a 
lawyer in the U.S. may not be able 
to help.
She recommended students 
impacted stay in touch with the 
International Center and their 
academic unit.
Chinese 
students 
account 
for approximately half of the 
University’s 
international 
student population. A 2018 report 
from the International Center 
found 
international 
students 
accounted for 14.9 percent of the 
student body that year.
In a tweet posted June 27, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel shared a letter from the 
president of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology titled 
“Letter to the MIT community: 
Immigration is a kind of oxygen.” 
Schlissel wrote in the tweet 
that while he is “concerned 
about 
national 
security, 
our 
international 
students, 
faculty 
and 
staff 
contribute 
immeasurably to the success of 
@umich and we offer them our 
friendship and support.”
Three weeks ago, Harvard 
University’s student newspaper, 
The 
Crimson, 
reported 
an 
incoming 
freshman 
had 
his 
visa revoked after arriving in 
Boston and was then deported. 
Following the initial article, the 
student’s story was featured 
in national news and he was 
permitted to enter the U.S. and 
begin schooling.However, the 
three students interviewed by 
The Daily have not found similar 
resolutions. 
LSA 
junior 
Jiaheng 
He, 
co-president 
of 
the 
Chinese 
Students 
and 
Scholars 
Association, said he was aware 
of multiple students who were 
unable to begin classes this 
semester because of visa delays. 
He, an international student 
himself, said the delays hurt the 
University’s status as a leading 
global institution.
“At Michigan, we are so proud 
of ourselves as the ‘Leaders 
and Best’ because we are able 
to attract so many scholars and 
students from all around the 
world to gather together and 
share their opinions,” he said. 
“But with the visa issue, there’s 
additional difficulty for us to 
get to the schools — not just for 
Chinese students, but for all 
the international students and 
scholars. It’s actually discouraged 
students from all around the 
world from coming to Michigan 
and share their opinions, so it’s 
not helpful for our diversity.”

“The report notes that faculty 
should not help students pursue 
educational 
or 
professional 
opportunities 
because 
they 
approve 
of 
that 
student’s 
politics,” Levitsky said. “And 
again, they can’t refuse to 
help because they politically 
disapprove. Finally, the report 
reminds us that it has never been 
the case that academic freedom 
is absolute. This is actually true 
for all freedoms in this country. 
No freedom is absolute.” 
The report explained the 
University has a responsibility 
to maintain academic integrity 
by treating faculty equally when 
it comes to political ideologies 
as well. 
“The 
report 
emphasizes 
that just as a faculty member 
cannot justify treating a student 
badly because of disagreements 
about political views, so too 
the University cannot treat a 
faculty member badly because 
of disagreements about political 
views,” Levitsky said. “Nor may 
the University make decisions 
based on pressure from outside 
the University, something that 
was an issue in the case last 
year.”
Following 
Levitsky’s 
overview, the eight attending 
graduate 
students 
had 
a 
moderated, 
confidential 
discussion 
about 
how 
the 
guidelines would impact them 
both as students and as graduate 
student instructors. Rackham 
assistant 
dean 
Ethriam 
Brammer said the purpose of 
the Rackham’s town hall was to 
hear how the report and policies 
would impact graduate students 
specifically.
Graduate students, Brammer 
said, have a dynamic position 
on campus because they are 
students but often employees 
as well. Because of this, the 
report and proposed policies 
would affect them in multiple 
positions. 
“They have multiple roles, it’s 

multi-faceted,” Brammer said. 
“In the case of writing letters of 
recommendation, for example, 
they’ll both need letters of 
recommendation to continue in 
their career, but they’ll often 
be asked to write letters of 
recommendation. We’re hoping 
that the graduate students are 
clear on what the principles are 
from the Blue Ribbon report, 
how that impacts them on their 
day to day responsibilities, but 
most importantly to see what 
their perspectives are regarding 
the report. 
Following 
the 
discussion, 
Social Work student Lauren 
Fine said though the report was 
a step in the right direction, its 
policy proposals still remained 
unclear, 
particularly 
when 
applied to GSIs. 
“I was glad to see that they did 
have a focus on responsibility 
to the student because that’s 
really important and one of the 
biggest questions that arises 
from this issue,” she said. “But I 
also was interested to see that it 
was pretty vague when it came 
to how to handle writing letters 
of recommendation if you have 
a specific political stance … they 
ended up with a pretty vague set 
of ideas that might help guide a 
GSI in making a decision but 
also might leave some questions 
unanswered.”
Fine is not a GSI and said 
hearing from fellow graduate 
students who were GSIs helped 
her understand why the report 
was so unclear in whether or not 
GSIs would be held to the same 
standard as faculty members, 
especially 
with 
regards 
to 
letters of recommendation. 
“There was the question of 
if GSIs are held to the same 
standards after their contracts 
are over, if a student approaches 
them for a recommendation 
after the fact, what’s their 
responsibility then?” Fine said. 
“I hope that they’re able to 
clarify some of these policies 
so that GSIs can make informed 
decisions about writing letters 
of recommendation.”

But, it was a marker of his intention 
to engage seriously in the subject 
matter. Dead center, straight up. 
He cared about it deeply.”
Amash cites the Constitution as 
the cornerstone of his philosophy 
as a public servant. He discusses 
how there were several instances 
when he as a conservative, could 
not vote for specific bills that he 
supported ideologically because 
they infringed the Constitution. 
“My 
dedication 
to 
the 
Constitution is what I am best 
known for in Congress,” Amash 
said. “In eight and a half years 
there, I have had to oppose 
countless 
bills 
that 
had 
no 
constitutional basis, or violated 
a constitutional provision. In 
many instances, I supported the 
bill’s policy changes but could 
not support the bill because of 
constitutional issues.”
Amash 
recalled 
when 
House Republicans introduced 
the National Right to Carry 
Reciprocity Act in 2011, which 
would allow nonresidents of a 
state to carry concealed weapons 
in that state. Amash noted that 
while he supports the right to 
carry permit reciprocity, he could 
not support the bill because there 
is no constitutional basis.
“I opposed the bill because it 
was drafted specifically to rely 
on the commerce clause. Private 
individuals 
carrying 
firearms 
isn’t commerce,” Amash said. “So 
this law can not be passed using 
Congress’s authority to regulate 
interstate commerce.”
When the lecture opened to 
a question and answer portion, 
Amash 
detailed 
his 
various 
grievances 
with 
the 
political 
stagnation. 
Earlier 
this 
year, 
Amash left the Republican Party 
and cited growing partisanship 
as his reason for leaving the two-
party system. 
“A lot of my colleagues who got 
frustrated just left, you know?” 
Amash said. “They gave up. They 
were tired. I’m sure you see it in 
the news all the time. They all 
pretend it’s a family consideration 
but they are really sick of the 
president in many cases.
Amash cited his disillusion with 
the lack of legislation being passed 
and how the Republican Party no 
longer represents his ideologies. 
“I went to Congress with the 
idea that we would change things 

incrementally, that I would go 
in there revive the Republican 
Party and turn it into a party that 
cares about liberty and process 
and cares about our constitution,” 
Amash said. “But I found that it’s 
just impossible, and that it can’t be 
changed anymore.”
Amash was the only Republican 
in the House of Representatives 
to call for President Trump’s 
impeachment. He notes how every 
term has predictable obstacles 
with the same solutions that rarely 
provide long term and constructive 
solutions.
“More than it used to be it’s 
political theatre,” Amash said. “It 
operates largely as performance 
art. When I look back on a term 
I kind of know how each term is 
going to go. Like at some point … 
there’s going to be a government 
shutdown. Then, the president 
and the two leaders come to some 
sort of compromise. And at the 
end of the year, very little happens 
legislatively 
except 
another 
omnibus bill is passed, more 
money is spent.”
Amash left the audience with a 
parting message to remind people 
of the fragility of the American 
democratic system. 
“I came here partly to give you a 
grim perspective,” Amash said. “I 
don’t think it’s good for people to 
think it works like you know ‘I’m 
just a bill’. It’s not ‘Schoolhouse 
Rock.’ It doesn’t work that way. We 
need to be frightened, we need to 
be worried about it.”
While 
Amash 
may 
have 
intended to leave his audience 
worried for the future of a 
democratic 
government, 
his 
lecture inspired LSA freshman 
Charles Hilu.
“I think this supplemented 
a love for the Constitution that 
I already have and more food 
for thought in terms of the 
constitutional questions in our 
current political systems,” Hilu 
said. 
Law School student Ameya 
Gehi also said she was surprised 
by how candid Amash in regards 
with all of the behind the scenes 
politics. 
“I think he was really principled 
and I was surprised on how honest 
he was about saying whether 
he 
thought 
something 
was 
constitutional or not,” Gehi said. 
“He wasn’t scared about being 
transparent about what goes on in 
the bill making process.”

T

his 
time 
of 
year, 
millions 
of 
students 
are moving to colleges 
and universities across the 
United States. They prepare 
for their classes, settle into 
their housing, reunite with old 
friends and prepare to make 
new connections. Though this 
time can be daunting for new 
students, it remains mostly 
shaped by optimism toward the 
expansive new opportunities 
awaiting these young adults. 
Yet as these Americans enter 
what 
will 
hopefully 
be 
a 
positive chapter in their lives, 
students half a world away 
are combatting a different, 
harrowing reality.
In Hong Kong, mass protests 
have roared on since late March 
against an amendment to a law 
that many Hong Kong citizens 
believe created a dangerous 
precedent for tyranny. The 
amendment in question would 
have 
allowed 
for 
accused 
criminal offenders in Hong 
Kong to be extradited to China 
for trial, where they will likely 
be convicted.
Opponents 
say 
the 
bill 
would 
essentially 
grant 
China the ability to detain 
whomever 
they 
view 
as 
threatening dissidents to the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
(CCP) and bring them to China 
to face a bleak fate. They 
fear that mainland China is 
making 
advances 
to 
break 
their agreement that allows 
Hong Kong to live under its 
own political and economic 
policies.
Within 
days 
of 
the 
amendment’s passage, thousands 
rallied in Hong Kong to demand 
its repeal, with the numbers 
of protesters growing past one 
million demonstrators. Among 
the large crowds are high school 
and college students, many of 
whom have taken leadership 
roles in the demonstrations. 
Though supported by their 
fellow activists, these students 
have been especially susceptible 
to threats against their lives 
and the lives of their families. 
Messages posted online and in 
city streets by individuals and 
organized groups have told 
students that they must stop 
protesting if they do not wish 
to see their loved ones harmed. 
Some threats have included 
the public posting of young 
protesters’ addresses and full 
names of students and their 
family members, warning them 
to stop their activity against 
the Hong Kong government and 
promising violence otherwise.
The heavy involvement by 
college-age Hong Kong citizens 
in these pro-democracy protests 
is not without precedent. In 2014 
the Umbrella Revolution in favor 

of democracy for Hong Kong took 
place. One of its youngest and most 
influential members, Nathan Law, 
was an undergraduate student 
at the time. Now he is one of the 
faces of the movement to oppose 
the extradition bill and China’s 
interference in Hong Kong’s 
political 
affairs. 
Though 
the 
Umbrella 
Revolution 
saw minimal victories, the 
involvement of Law and other 
voices has helped create a 
culture of student activism in 
Hong Kong. He believes that 
most young adults in Hong 
Kong share his vision for greater 
transparency, the elimination of 
corruption and the growth of 
democracy.

While the 2014 protests 
saw some concessions by the 
governments in Beijing and 
Hong Kong, and the current 
protests are still ongoing, the 
history of student activism 
against the CCP’s policies is 
quite dark. The most impactful 
chapter took place in June 1989 
at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. 
June 3 and 4 marked the height 
of protests by students and 
young adults throughout China 
in favor of increased individual 
liberties and against rampant 
corruption within the CCP 
government. In response to 
the mass protests, the most 
visible of which was held 
in Tiananmen Square, CCP 
officials decided to crush the 
demonstrations by force. After 
crowds of citizens originally 
prevented the military from 
reaching Tiananmen Square, 
tanks rolled in and forced 
protesters 
to 
flee, 
while 
Chinese 
forces 
fired 
upon 
those who continued to resist 
and those running for their 
lives. An official death toll has 
not been released, but some 
lists estimate the toll at 10,000 
dead. The United States is still 
pushing China to release the 
lists of those who were killed 
and went missing in those 
tragic events.
The 
Tiananmen 
Square 
massacre, 
which 
the 
CCP 
defends to this day, caused a 
widespread fear of protesting 
against 
the 
authoritarian 

government in Beijing. With 
the 
proliferation 
of 
the 
Chinese regime’s surveillance 
technology, fears of being 
recognized, threatened, killed, 
detained or labeled a dissident 
by the government are a real 
concern to the protesters. 
These young people, who are 
simply trying to preserve the 
autonomy that China agreed 
to grant them in 1997, are 
scared for their loved ones and 
themselves. Yet they continue 
their efforts in the face of a 
Hong Kong legislature that is 
greatly manipulated by Beijing 
and its sympathizers within 
the city leadership.
The 
polar 
juxtaposition 
of the current realities for 
students in the United States 
and in Hong Kong is shocking 
and 
should 
make 
young 
Americans across the country 
feel incredibly fortunate. They 
can carry on full time with 
their education and mostly 
live free, uninterrupted lives. 
Though they may approve or 
disapprove of their national 
or state governments, their 
activism is allowed to continue 
and 
their 
speech 
remains 
free. The U.S. Constitution, 
complete with an expansive 
Bill of Rights and a checks-and- 
balances system, assures their 
leaders never attain totalitarian 
power like the CCP. They live 
under a democratic system that 
gives them direct influence 
in choosing the leadership in 
their political system. It is no 
coincidence that in search of 
inspiration in their fight for 
freedom, demonstrators have 
been seen waving the United 
States flag and singing “The 
Star-Spangled Banner.”
These are privileges that 
are easy to simply take as 
facts of life for an American 
college student. However, the 
students of Hong Kong are not 
so lucky. Thirty years after one 
of the most brutal repressions 
of protest in history, aimed 
at 
students 
by 
the 
same 
authoritarian 
forces, 
these 
courageous young men and 
women are risking the freedom 
they still have to demand the 
freedom they deserve. 
This fact should cause us to 
cherish the freedoms we hold 
as students in the U.S., and 
bring our attention to what is 
happening across the globe. 
The demonstrators in Hong 
Kong deserve our admiration, 
respect, support and — if 
possible — assistance. At the 
very least, we should not take 
for granted the liberty which 
we have, and which they seek 
so desperately.

NOAH ENTE | COLUMN

The Hong Kong protests should give us perspective

T

he 2020 presidential 
election is just over a 
year away, and things 
are starting to heat up. Twitter 
is full of soundbites from the 
Democratic debates, polling 
numbers are all over the place 
and President Donald Trump is 
brainstorming new nicknames 
for each Democratic candidate. 
While many Democrats will 
focus on who can beat Trump, 
more of them should really 
be focusing on who can beat 
Mitch McConnell and other 
Senate Republicans who are 
up for re-election. In American 
society there is an enchantment 
with 
presidential 
elections, 
which 
is 
understandable. 
Electing the face of our nation 
is no small task and deserves 
a great amount of attention, 
but the Senate elections may 
prove to be just as important, 
if not more so. With recent 
news of the University of 
Michigan placing a bid to host 
a presidential debate, it may 
become even harder for the 
students of our school to focus 
on what is going on in Senate 
races across the country. 
To truly understand why 
the 
Senate 
elections 
hold 
such 
significant 
meaning, 
one must first understand the 
essential powers of the Senate. 
The Senate has the power to 
confirm or reject presidential 
appointees, approve treaties, 
conduct 
investigations, 
conduct impeachment trials 
and plays a major role in 
approving or blocking bills. 
This gives the Senate power to 
steer America in the direction 
it chooses, and the person who 
currently steers that ship is 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky. McConnell 
has been a senator since 1984 
and has won re-election five 

times, despite his low approval 
ratings. For those at home 
counting, that means he’s been 
in office for 35 years, making 
him a real relic of the Senate. 
If I could use one word that 
perfectly describes McConnell, 
it would be “obstructionist.” 
Over the past four years he 
has done everything in his 
power 
to 
block 
anything 
that he doesn’t like, even if 
it was accomplished through 
bipartisan compromise. The 
most obvious example of his 
obstructionist nature can be 
seen in 2016 when President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
nomination 
of Merrick Garland for the 
Supreme Court was blocked by 
McConnell, who refused to even 
hold confirmation hearings. 
“One of my proudest moments 
was when I looked Barack 
Obama in the eye and I said, 
‘Mr. President, you will not fill 
the Supreme Court vacancy,’” 
McConnell said. While this is 
a big deal, this isn’t even the 
thing that enrages me most 
about McConnell’s leadership. 
What 
should 
upset 
every 
American, 
let 
alone 
every 
student on campus, is the rate 
at which he blocks bills that are 
desperately needed and would 
greatly benefit the American 
people. 
The 
entire 
U.S. 
intelligence community agreed 
that the Kremlin meddled in 
our election. In response to 
this, the House Democrats 
decided to act. In just the past 
few months, McConnell has 
blocked two election security 
bills. Both bills passed in the 
House, but when they came 
to McConnell’s desk, he killed 
the bills. The bills would have 
given $600 million to update 
voting equipment, and included 
certain 
paper 
requirements 
for 
voting 
machines. 
This 

was a real attempt to combat 
a foreign nation hacking our 
elections. Yet, McConnell saw 
the bill as hyperpartisan, and 
refused to hold a vote on it. 
On top of that, he has blocked 
numerous bills on gun control 
that many Americans want. 
After every mass shooting, we 
all ask, “Will something be 
done this time?” Unfortunately, 
while McConnell is leading the 
Senate, the answer seems to be 
no. 
Why does he do all this? 
Is it because he is a career 
politician who has been bought 
by different lobby groups? Yes. 
Earlier in the year, he received 
a large campaign donation 
from 
the 
voting 
machine 
lobby, 
then 
proceeded 
to 
block the election security 
bills 
that 
would’ve 
put 
a 
larger financial burden on 
voting 
machine 
companies. 
Additionally, throughout his 
career, 
the 
National 
Rifle 
Association has donated more 
than $1 million to McConnell’s 
campaigns. It’s clear why he 
doesn’t want to tackle the 
gun control issue. But that 
doesn’t paint the full picture. 
It’s also because he has had 
the safety of knowing that no 
matter what, he will go back to 
Kentucky and win re-election. 
McConnell has always been 
more obsessed with retaining 
power rather than cooperating 
with senators across the aisle. 
In an interview with NPR, 
McConnell 
would 
respond 
to criticism by continually 
citing that he has never lost an 
election for his seat. 

The most important race of 2020 is in Kentucky, 

and it’s not the derby

The Cuban embargo revisited

T

he 
United 
States’ 
opposition to the spread of 
communism abroad bears 
a long and complicated political 
history. Even today, long after Cold 
War tensions thawed, U.S. policy 
toward communist regimes such 
as China, Cuba and North Korea 
indicates that some hostilities 
have not entirely melted away. In 
particular, U.S. policy towards 
Cuba is still mired by residual 
antagonism towards revolutionary 
leader Fidel Castro’s communist 
regime that arose in the late 1950s. 
More than 50 years later, the 
notorious Cuban embargo that 
began in 1958 has remained in 
place with few adjustments since 
its original implementation. 
The Cuban embargo, which 
makes 
economic 
engagement 
between Cuba and the U.S. nearly 
impossible, has taken up more 
than its fair share of controversy. 
Originally, the intention of the 
policy was to display the United 
States’ opposition to the Cuban 
revolution and Castro’s subsequent 
communist regime, which had 
become 
violently 
oppressive 
towards its own citizens (Human 
Rights Watch provides a decent 
background on the repression 
thousands of Cubans faced during 
the country’s revolution.). The 
United States’ decision to maintain 
the embargo after more than 50 
years has been criticized at length 
both at home and abroad. The 
United Nations has repeatedly 
condemned the embargo, asserting 
that it causes needless harm to 
ordinary Cuban citizens who 
are powerless over their political 
situation and suggesting that it 
may even violate international law.
After all these years, then, 
the question remains: Has the 
embargo worked? The best answer 
is both yes and no, depending on 
which definition of success we’re 
working with. 
If the only goal of the embargo 
is 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
U.S.’s 
dissatisfaction with Cuba’s human 
rights abuses and corrupt political 
system, then the Cuban embargo 
has likely achieved what its policy 
designers 
intended. 
Barring 
nearly all exports and investment 
between Cuba and the U.S., the 
embargo sends a massive political 
signal. There is no uncertainty 
about the United States’ disgust 
toward the Castro dictatorship and 
its willingness to oppress its own 
citizens. 

If the goal of the embargo is to 
achieve material change within 
the country of Cuba, however, the 
results are harder to identify. Other 
countries that sought to challenge 
or oppose the U.S. — notably 
Russia and Venezuela — also filled 
the gap left by the U.S.’ cessation 
of 
diplomatic 
negotiations. 
Venezuelan oil flowed in like a 
lifeline to the struggling Cuban 
economy 
and 
provided 
an 
essential life raft for the Castro 
regime. Cuba’s heads of state 
recognized fairly quickly that the 
United States was not essential to 
the island’s economic future. And 
thus, like the embargo, Cuba’s 
one-party system has remained 
intact with little to no visible 
change. 
But 
outside 
of 
domestic 
politics within the United States, 
it is difficult to say whether the 
country remains the same as the 
one the U.S. accused of being a 
dictatorship in the 1960s. Raul 
Castro, who took control after 
his brother Fidel ceded power 
following 
several 
secretive 
hospitalizations, initiated broad 
economic reforms that allowed 
Cuba to thrive despite the U.S.’s 
embargo. Liberalization efforts 
encouraged a fledgling private 
sector 
(which 
now 
employs 
12 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
workforce) 
to 
grow 
robustly 
alongside trade with new allies 
like Nicaragua in the 1970s and 
1980s. Recently, Cuba’s health 
care industry has flourished with 
results that parallel or exceed 
the U.S. in infant mortality, life 
expectancy and average health 
care 
expenditures 
per 
year 
despite a notable lack of resources 
compared to wealthier democratic 
countries. 
New 
changes 
to 
the Cuban Constitution allow 
for 
some 
private 
ownership 
of property. All in all, Cuba is 
proving itself to be shifting away 
from 
state-owned 
enterprises 
and towards privatization — a 
small but definitive shift away 
from 
communism. 
Because 
Cuba’s political growth since 
the 1960s has been complex, 
the lack of real variation in the 
U.S. embargo seems concerning. 
The president’s recent political 
strategy towards Cuba is even less 
reassuring. 
It seems that the embargo 
is likely to stay given President 
Donald Trump’s hardline policies, 
which include tightening Obama-

era travel exceptions to the 
embargo and discouraging U.S. 
foreign investment into Cuban 
firms or products. However, the 
president’s 
strategy 
towards 
Cuba has doubled down on the 
embargo’s original intentions 
and has shown a firm resistance 
to 
a 
genuine 
diplomatic 
relationship. In 2017, the Trump 
administration 
also 
pulled 
nearly two-thirds of the U.S. 
embassy staff from Havana, 
and as a result the embassy’s 
functions came to a sluggish 
halt. Policymakers, as the half-
empty embassy would suggest, 
are choosing not to focus on U.S.-
Cuba relations. 
And they have their reasons 
to think that way. It is easy 
to dismiss Cuba as a small 
and insignificant country in 
the context of international 
politics — countries like Russia, 
China and Iran often dominate 
newspaper 
headlines. 
But 
Cuba plays a startlingly large 
role in international relations, 
and the country has often 
become tightly enmeshed in 
larger disputes between rival 
powers. This year alone, Russia 
loaned millions of euros to the 
Cuban military as a message 
of goodwill. And Oriente — the 
region containing Cuba’s eastern 
provinces — is facing economic 
stress and potential collapse as a 
result of U.S. sanctions towards 
Venezuela 
as 
the 
country 
experiences mass civil unrest. 
Whether or not the Cuban 
embargo’s results in 2019 are in 
line with its intended goals from 
1958, U.S. policymakers should 
revisit economic policy towards 
Cuba. Given the changing of 
the guard since Fidel Castro’s 
death and much of the country’s 
recent economic liberalization, 
current U.S. policy towards the 
country is largely outdated and 
reflective of Cold War hostility 
that passed its expiration date 
long ago. While many claim that 
the embargo has succeeded in 
demonstrating U.S. democratic 
resolve 
and 
leadership, 
the 
failure to reconsider U.S.-Cuba 
relations will only further isolate 
Cuba and push the country 
towards an increasingly hostile 
and dangerous relationship with 
the U.S.

Grudges are a funny thing — they can last for years, 
or be over within the span of a week. There is little to no 
correlation between the pettiness of the original offense 
and the length of the grudge. They’re a habit that make 
zero sense, and yet they remain a source of unnecessary 
strife in many of our lives. Ann Patchett’s newest release, 
“The Dutch House,” revolves around the familial grudges 
that can often drive the development of life as we know it. 
The story spans the lives of two siblings, Danny and 
Maeve Conroy, as they navigate life without a mother, 
a new life with their stepmother and, eventually, a life 
without any parents. Told from Danny’s perspective, it’s 
a book that emphasizes how little we actually know about 
the people who raise us. Danny and Maeve, for example, 

only begin to learn about their father after his death (and 
their subsequent expulsion from the family house.) It 
takes them years to finally understand why their mother 
abandoned them — Danny because he never thought to 
ask the necessary questions, and Maeve because she never 
really wanted to know the answer. As new information 
continues to reveal itself, Patchett continually forces her 
readers to consider what they actually know about the 
people who made them. How did they meet? Why did they 
get married? Why would a mother leave her two kids? 
We really only ever know what Danny knows, and he’s 
the epitome of an unreliable narrator. He’s a self-centered 
character, and even as he injects his revelations from 
the future into the stories he tells, there is still an air of 

suspicion as the reader takes Danny at his word. Though 
his circumstances are unique, it’s his conceited tendencies 
that makes him a relatable character. He goes through life 
believing that he and his sister alone are the only people 
who could possibly understand their situation. We’re all 
inclined to it, this assumption that we are the only people 
in the world who are suffering. 
Fictional stories based on the changes we experience 
as we grow up are a cliché, though for a good reason. 
Readers can connect with Danny at all stages of his life, 
as they reminisce over their twenties or sympathize 
with his struggles as a teen. What sets Patchett’s 
writing apart, though, is the difference in age between 
Danny the narrator and Danny the character. Danny 
the narrator is an omnipotent presence — in the midst 
of heated moments, Patchett inserts Danny’s reflections 
and feelings about the situation from years in the future. 
While reminiscing, he adds notes and thoughts to the 
action and conversations of the past. Eventually, the book 
begins to feel like Danny is simply having a conversation 
with himself, trying to figure out where things might 
have gone in a different direction. 
In these reflecting conversations, whether it’s with 
Maeve or Danny himself, it becomes increasingly obvious 
that the two characters never actually realized they 
held a grudge until it was staring them in the face, in the 
form of their contentious stepmother. Though years had 
passed, grudges can be tough to overcome, and Patchett 
eventually addresses the issue by making Danny and 
Maeve confront the subject of their grudge later in the 
future — a difficult task for many people, let alone those 
who might not even realize they still harbor negative 
feelings.
All families have their issues, some more than others, 
and Ann Patchett turns those of the Conroys into a 
story spanning whole lifetimes. It’s a common premise 
that Patchett executes well. She’s able to touch on a 
wide range of problems without losing her focus on the 
characters, while also deftly weaving in the way family 
roles change as we age. “The Dutch House” manages to 
take a seemingly boring story of family fighting and turn 
it into a universal truth.

Patchett elevates the mundane

Trauma and healing, illness and health, dreams and 
reality. The common conception is that we can only 
experience one or the other, but “Undone” by Raphael 
Bob-Waksberg (“Bojack Horseman”) proves to us that 
not only are they related, but they are constantly walking 
hand-in-hand to challenge and alter our lives when we 
least expect it. Using animation like you’ve never seen 
on television before, the show disrupts the ideal rules of 
television genre by gracefully leaping over boundaries 
between mystery, thriller, animation, drama and fantasy 
whilst remaining true to life and centered in the core of the 
human experience. 
From the pilot, it delves deep into the life of Alma 
Winograd-Diaz (Rosa Salazar, “Alita: Battle Angel”) and 
her investigation into her father’s death. Her father, Jacob 
Winograd (Bob Odenkirk, “Better Call Saul”), died in a car 
accident when she was a child. A car accident of her own 
gave her a glimpse into the realm of the afterlife, and Alma 
begins to see her father everywhere. He’s convinced that 
his car accident was actually a murder, and begs Alma to 
investigate the incident using her new ability to manipulate 
time. Together, they leap into the world of time travel 
and shamanism to try and prevent Jacob’s accident from 
occurring in the past, in an attempt to change the future. 
Since the creators used rotoscope animation — a tactic 
that makes the animation look more realistic — they were 
able to make the characters look like their respective 
actors, so it feels like watching a realistic dream that 
contorts into fiction as it plays out. Sometimes the realism 
of the series makes it easy to forget that you’re watching an 
animation, until the show starts to bend reality and twist it 
into dream-like states of confusion. And while it feels like 

a bad (but inexplicably good) trip, “Undone” never fails to 
ground itself in reality and real-life existentialism. 
Before Alma’s accident, she felt the all-too familiar 
feeling of being stuck in a routine and wondering if there 
was more to life. Even after the accident, even after she 
inherited time-altering powers, the feeling of being human 
and yearning for more never left her. Despite the chaos 
that ensues, the show hits your emotions as hard if not 
harder than any other show could. The show also unravels 
concepts of trauma, unresolved conflict and the fickleness 
of memory that everyone has experienced at some point in 
their life, and talks about flawed families in a way that most 
can relate to. 

The eight episodes waste no time developing the world 
of Alma, but it never feels rushed or forced. It’s original, 
it’s chaotic and it’s a quick but fulfilling series. It’s a 5K of 
emotion, tension and familiarity that’ll change the way 
you perceive time-travel movies in the best way possible. 
It executes its societal duty by including marginalized and 
indigineous cultures into the plot without being preachy, 
and if that doesn’t sell it to you, Tyler Posey (“The Last 
Summer”) plays a priest. And yes, his character looks 
like him. If you love television, you’ll love this show. It’s a 
refreshing glimpse of what great television can look and 
feel like, and I would be personally offended if it didn’t win 
as many awards as it deserves. Do yourself a favor, block out 
four hours of the day and watch “Undone.”

‘Undone’ outdoes its trope

SOPHIA YOON
Daily Arts Writer
Returning to Ann Arbor in September is my 
favorite homecoming. Between the mad rush of 
students racing back to campus, the delight in the 
eyes of young freshman and the air of a beginning, 
September is my favorite month. Ann Arbor is 
special in that it is home to our beloved University 
and a city that is constantly growing and changing 
in accordance with demands from the thousands 
of students to stay on top of trends. The foodie 
culture and restaurant atmosphere in Ann Arbor is 
no exception to the rule. On any given day, one can 
experience a wide and diverse array of cultures 
and flavors through the culinary offerings lining 
the outskirts of the University. To pay homage to 
these recommendations, I’ve compiled a drool-
worthy list of some of my favorite places in Ann 
Arbor.
The place to become a Sunday Morning regular: 
Frank’s 
Open since 1969, Frank’s is one of Ann Arbor’s 
best kept foodie secrets. Known for thick, buttery 
French toast drizzled with sweet syrup, loaded 
western omelets piled on top of chipped white 
plates and familiar faces, Frank’s is not exactly 
what it seems from its exterior. A hole in the wall 
tucked off of E. Liberty, Frank’s is full of home-y 
personality and a history that dates back 50 years. 
Frank’s is a go-to for a breakfast you won’t forget 
and a late-night option if you crave breakfast at all 
hours of the night. 
If you’re craving your grandmother’s baba 
ghanouj: Jerusalem Garden
Jerusalem Garden began in 1987 with the 
family recipes of an Ann Arbor resident who 
was originally born in Jerusalem. Their creamy 
homemade hummus is layered on almost every 
menu item and the crispy falafel cannot be beat. 
Priding themselves on a strong background of 
family and heritage, Jerusalem Garden serves the 
best Mediterrean food in Ann Arbor. It is a versatile 
option with both dine in and to-go options. 
The best taco in Ann Arbor: Chela’s
If you hail from the west coast and are used to 
authentic Mexican food on every street corner, it 
may come as a challenge to find similar quality eats 
in Ann Arbor. Chela’s, however, has cornered Ann 
Arbor’s market on Mexican food. If you’re looking 
for a perfectly seasoned pork, beef or chicken taco 
on a double layered homemade corn tortilla, a 
Cubana torta, homemade chicken tamales and a 
horchata, Chela’s is your place. 
When you want the best burger in Ann Arbor, 
plantain chips and an alcoholic milkshake, all at 
once: Frita Batidos 

This cuban-inspired street food set in a chic all 
white space in downtown Ann Arbor may be my 
number one recommendation for any time of day, 
any occasion and any palate. The female-owned 
business serves fritas (chorizo-based, Cuban-
inspired burgers) and batidos (tropical milkshakes) 
in various flavors made with fresh fruit and rich 
vanilla ice cream. The unique, versatile menu is 
accented by fresh ingredients and a constantly 
buzzing atmosphere. Frita’s also serves 6-person 
fishbowl margaritas and hosts happy hour Sunday 
through Thursday from 4-6 PM as well as their 
last hour of service. 
When you have to recap your night out over 
breakfast: Angelo’s
Since 1956, Angelo’s has opened its doors on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings to hordes of 
students and locals alike patiently awaiting their 
weekly breakfast tradition or guilty pleasure fried 
French toast. The quintessential diner vibe should 
not be overlooked. When it comes to breakfast 
food, the team behind Angelo’s knows what 
they’re doing. A family business passed down 
through generations, Angelo’s is the perfect place 
to go to in your pajamas with all your friends to 
recap the previous evening’s endeavors. After 
piling into cozy booths slightly sticky with maple 
syrup, you’ll leave Angelo’s incredibly full and your 
hangover miraculously cured. 
A non-awkward first date spot:
Slurping Turtle
A unique twist on traditional Japanese ramen 
bars, Slurping Turtle is a laid-back eatery serving 
customizable ramen bowls, sashimi and a variety 
of shareable appetizers. The low-stakes setting 
and high-top seating allows for a casual dining 
experience that isn’t too loud or too quiet, too 
fancy or too low-key. In addition to a delicious and 
unique menu, Slurping Turtle offers a fun cocktail 
list and a variety of wines and sake. Slurping 
Turtle is perfect for friends and family, a casual 
first date spot or the best comfort food when the 
winter months have you down. 
Just finished tailgating, feed me: 
Blimpy Burger
In 1953, Blimpy Burger opened in Ann Arbor, 
and tailgating would be changed forever. Krazy 
Jim’s Blimpy Burger is a known fan and student 
favorite, cultivating lines down the road on 
football Saturdays with tipsy fans craving a greasy 
cheeseburger and crispy jumbo onion rings. With 
the stove right in front of you and not much seating 
space, Blimpy Burger is your on-the-go kind of 
joint. The steak fries are so good they should 
only really come in the larger “papa” size. The 
burgers are the star of the show, however, and an 
adventurous, hungry eater can opt for the ‘quint,’ a 
five-patty burger all tucked under one bun.

O h , the things you 
can eat in Ann Arbor!

JPEGMAFIA’s All My Heroes Are Cornballs rides 
on the success of his 2018 effort Veteran. The same 
motifs, tools and ad-libs set the scene again as MAFIA 
traces back his anguish, trauma and anxiety in his 
characteristically murky, comical lo-fi rap. His signature 
“you think you know me” line tags nearly every track, 
circling back to an ever-persistent theme of there being 
more pain and truth beneath one’s surface persona. 
Much like his former releases, All My Heroes conveys his 
trauma as a veteran, with imagery of bullets and mental 
turmoil scattered across the tracks. But don’t let this fool 
you into thinking this album is a Veteran 2.0.
“It was funny to me,” MAFIA said of Veteran’s 
success in an interview with Billboard. “It was 
interesting seeing people react to something I made in 
a private time, having them attach weird, preconceived 
notions onto it that that aren’t real.” Veteran presented 
itself at a point in MAFIA’s career in which he took a 
turn towards more personal work. Operating in the 
experimental underground rap scene for years, MAFIA 
never expected Veteran to explode onto the mainstream 

rap charts. “There was nothing indicating it would be 
anything else. I’m glad it did receive the reaction it did, 
though. That was a blessing.” 
MAFIA is haunted by the same troubles he was 18 
months ago, from being a former veteran to his mental 
state and aspirations for his career. This time around, 

however, a lot of it is muffled under his newfound 
popularity since Veteran. This is projected into a lot of All 
My Heroes songs, a dense 18-track project cut from the 
93 that MAFIA created since Veteran — with these, it’s 
clear that fame doesn’t afford the same ease as being an 
underground Baltimore rapper. 
“Beta Male Strategies” follows this narrative directly. 
Not apparent from the get-go, this song serves as a 
clap-back to Twitter trolls who trash MAFIA’s work 
and character without having a true scope of either 
one. He directly shifts from telling off his haters to “say 
what you said on Twitter right now” to proclaiming 
“Young PEGGY, I’m a false prophet / Bringing white 
folks this new religion” in reference to his embrace from 
publications like Pitchfork. A tried-and-true theme 
in the rap scene, but unlike any other artist, MAFIA 
manages to create a comedic bend, audibly chewing food 
as he recites “Ain’t no details / Ain’t no conversation” 
onto a beautiful, hazy synth-wave intro. 
Sentiments on MAFIA’s potential to disappoint 
haters are mimicked from Twitter throughout the 
entire album. “Post Verified Lifestyle” most directly 
taps into this energy, computer-mouse clicks ringing in 
the bare, bouncy lo-fi intro. MAFIA, however, follows 
in with hard hitting vocals, his imagery oscillating on 
a blurred continuum of gunshots and internet activity. 
“I’m treatin’ this bitch like a cuck, brrt, MAC, loadin’ it 
up,” he spits in the first verse. 
Sonically speaking, All My Heroes shudders through 
hard-hitting samples and keyboards to sheer twinkling, 
plucking synths and flutes. Never a sparse or stable 
moment, the album toys with our expectations as it 
deftly cuts back between the rougher MAFIA we met on 
Veteran to a softer, subdued version introduced to us on 
All My Heroes Are Cornballs. It’s most impressive when 
it morphs our perception of sound, the imperceptible 
pitching, coughs and sighs, gun ad-libs and looped 
samples subtly coloring the entire experience. This, 
strangely enough, ties the entire album together, shading 
the chaotic beat shifts and sporadic vocal outbursts 
well under the amplified glitchy beats and scratchy 
instrumentals. 
This blurry concept unfolds and pairs well 
thematically. Though certainly far from a concept album, 

it forms itself on top of references that blend well into one 
another and amplify the messages carried by the sound. 
“PTSD” aptly conveys this. It’s MAFIA at his most 
exasperated, as he raps about his mental state. Its intro 
beat mimics the sound of multiple gunshots firing at once 
after an echoing narrator recites “Don’t stop” over and 
over again under sheer keyboards. Snapshots that paint 
individual songs like this carry on throughout others to 
generate a more cohesive feel. Notably, “Grimy Waifu”, a 
track that seemingly harkens back to your favorite anime 
intro from 2014, proves itself to be less about a potential 
love interest and more about his relationship to a weapon 
of some sort, the metaphor constantly evolving between 
his ideas about his job to those about war and racism. We 
find a similar effect even in brief references to guns in 
other songs’ verses, whether a gunshot sounding ad-lib 
or a reference to him stuffing a glock in his pocket. 
At the thematic core of the album is the track “Kenan 
vs. Kel.” A direct reference to the iconic ’90s sitcom 
“Kenan & Kel,” the song unfolds as a combat between 
two sides that should be working together. It features 
the most effortless beat shift of the entire album and ties 
in nearly all of its themes and ideas. It harkens back to 

the female perspective introduced to us on lead single 
“Jesus Forgive me, I Am A Thot.” Through constant 
references to being a “thot,” MAFIA communicates 
his unwillingness to conform to society’s standards 
for his music and persona. With some of the album’s 
most creative bars, it manages to tie in images of him as 
“Prince Peach” in the Mario franchise while conveying 
messages on nonconformity and unwillingness to appeal 
to white people. 
At its most deft and creative, All My Heroes Are 
Cornballs succeeds in its capacity to tie in themes, 
motifs and imagery into a central motif. In a way that 
Veteran couldn’t, it guides and scolds the persona of 
JPEGMAFIA known to the public by bouncing off 
of Twitter references and his more elaborate fashion 
choices that lead to the Heroes era. This brings us closer 
to a MAFIA who transfers every emotion and idea 
abstractly into his music in a way that casual listeners 
and, more importantly, haters will never understand. 
By striving for a true, unique and personal take, 
JPEGMAFIA manages to convey more about himself 
as an artist and appeal to fans without sacrificing his 
originality.

MAFIA gives no shits on ‘All My Heroes are Cornballs’

Are Cornballs

This summer, I saw “Network” 
for the first time. Then I saw it again. 
And again. And again. Sidney Lumet’s 
incendiary 1972 newsroom satire has 
become inescapable, lingering in my 
thoughts just long enough to necessitate 
a rewatch. Every time I return to it, I feel 
like I’m strapped into a roller coaster 
that only plummets downward. That 
feeling of intense, unnerving, endless 
vertigo is an inevitable part of watching 
“Network,” a movie that stretches 
and twists its depraved fantasy until 
it resembles reality. For as verbose 
and esoteric as it is (we’re talking 
about the movie that Aaron Sorkin 
cites as an inspiration for becoming 
a screenwriter), there’s hardly a dull 
moment in Paddy Chayefsky’s Oscar-
winning script.
I find myself going back to “Network” 
so ravenously that it plays out like 
several types of movies packed into one. 
The first act is innocent and reserved 
compared to the rest of the movie, a dark 
examination of broadcaster Howard 
Beale (Peter Finch, “Sunday Bloody 
Sunday”) and his frank consideration 
of 
suicide 
during 
his 
last 
live 
broadcast before retirement. When he 
announces this intention on the air and 
reinvigorates ratings for the financially 
floundering news division, “Network” 
becomes an entirely different kind of 
movie. It loses all notions of morality 
or order, if it ever had them to begin 
with. It becomes a story uniquely of 
the ’70s, a nightmare of gasoline prices, 
generational schism, stagflation and 
obscene corporate politics. What I find 
remarkable about the rest of the movie 
is how easily it pulls me into its orbit. I 

buy into the absurdity time and time 
again not because I want to — I simply 
can’t help myself. If “Network” is all one 
big joke, then I want in on the punchline. 
The transformation of “Network” 
into a hypothetical hellscape happens 
so fast you might miss it. Experiencing 
this for the first time is akin to falling off 
a cliff. The movie is confidently going 
somewhere unpredictable and you are 
powerless to stop it. Howard himself is 
an indicator of this shift, turning from 
a past-his-prime broadcaster pushed 
out by the network to the company’s 
hottest product, a “latter-day prophet 
denouncing the hypocrisies of our 
time,” as he is ultimately known. “I’m 
as mad as hell and I’m not going to 
take this anymore!” he complains. And 
America complains with him, literally 
opening their windows and yelling this 
token remark into the thunderous night. 
But the far more compelling character 
to arise from the film’s turn to violent 
sensationalism is head of programming 
Diana Christensen, played by Faye 
Dunaway (“Bonnie and Clyde”) in 
one of my favorite performances ever. 
Amid an office of crusty aging male 
executives, Christensen is far and away 
the most vibrant element of the movie. 
Experiencing her taking advantage 
of Howard’s explosion of viewership 
is purely satisfying. She is beautifully 
neurotic and unforgiving, planning 
three, four steps ahead for every 
possible outcome of her ambition. She 
moves her coworkers, even the higher-
ups of the network, around like chess 
pawns both physically in the newsroom 
and structurally in the corporation, 
all of these razor-sharp calculations 
constantly apparent in Dunaway’s 
disposition. 
If the first and second acts have sent 
us off the rails and into the abyss, the 

third act is where “Network” jettisons 
its audience into the roiling lake of 
fire at the bottom of the pit. It’s hard 
to comprehend exactly how grim the 
narrative turns; this is where multiple 
viewings have allowed me to internalize 
the sheer scope of the carnage. When 
we learn what the title “Network” is 
actually referring to — a web of corporate 
cosmology, dollars that control the 
world, the death of the individual — the 
movie becomes a little too prescient for 
comfort. Of course, we learn all of this 
through Ned Beatty’s (“Toy Story 3”) 
legendary and terrifying monologue for 
which he won a Best Supporting Oscar. 
It’s impossible to witness this scene 
and ignore its logic. “There is only IBM 
and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, 
Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are 
the nations of the world today,” Jensen 
preaches. A possible reading of this 
line and “Network” as a whole is as a 
compact time capsule, starting with 
its feet firmly planted in the ’70s and 
ending in a bleaker, more modern era. 
As 
damning 
as 
the 
finale 
of 
“Network” is, both to the monstrous 
corporations of the world and the 
wicked populism that fuels cable news, 
it’s all one big joke. It’s little more than 
a playlist of worst-case hypotheticals, 
cycled to the point of insanity. The 
movie fearmongers, it coaxes one into its 
carefully spun half-truths. By the end, it 
may be hard to know exactly what’s real. 
That’s why I haven’t been able to keep 
myself away from the movie. “Network” 
has an iridescence in its commentary: 
It’s satire and reality mixed irreversibly 
together. This flexibility makes the film 
a thrilling, enigmatic rewatch. And I 
know that for all the certainties I attach 
to its meaning, satirical or otherwise, 
the next time I watch it I will be just as 
unsure as I was the first time. 

The absurd corporate politics
of ‘Network’ will never get old 

FILM NOTEBOOK

The 2019 Man Booker nominees are out 
and, with a tense month of reading ahead, why 
not rest on our laurels and remember 2018’s 
winner, “Milkman.”

It takes only a page or two of reading 
to realize that the cover of “Milkman” is 
deceptive. The binding of the 2018 winner of 
the Man Booker Prize depicts an innocuous, 
fluorescent-pink sunset — one of those once 
a year, stop-and-snap-a-photo sunsets that 
makes “Milkman” stands out among its 
fellow books.
The sedative lightness of the cover seems 
to admit innocuousness. But “Milkman” 
is not innocuous. Nor is it gentle, or quiet, 
or apologetic — nothing that the cover 
may suggest about a subdued, romantic 
narrative. To say I wasn’t excited to read the 
Booker winner would be a lie — based on the 
superficiality of covers and excerpts, I have 
rooted for “Milkman” since its nomination 
on the long-list — but the way I fell in love 
with reading “Milkman” was not in the 
pleasant, blushing manner I had expected. It 
was a cycle of shock, recoil and return.
Anna Burns’s third novel narrates the 
story of an 18-year-old girl (referred to as 
“Middle Sister,” as none of the characters 
in “Milkman” are prescribed actual names) 
over the course of two months. Her unnamed 
town is saturated with violence — violence 
from the ubiquitously demonized enemy 
countries “over the water,” violence from 
the renouncers of the state that control 
Middle Sister’s town and violence from the 
state police as they intervene in a village 
of scattered revolutionaries. Surprisingly, 
though, this war-zone setting is but an 
offhand normality in the book. Instead, it is 
Milkman, a paramilitary that begins making 
unwarranted advances on middle sister, that 
takes the place of chief antagonist in the book.
At first glance, Burns lays out an invidious 
landscape that seems to hyperbolize the 
dark experience of growing up as a woman 
in the late 20th century. Maybe, Burns 
seems to suggest, the descent of society 
would look like this for all genders. But 
on second thought, the landscape Middle 
Sister walks — and how her hyperaware, 
rightfully-paranoid thoughts congeal in it 
— becomes painfully real. Middle Sister’s 
encounters with Milkman while walking, 
her fears of being drugged, the pernicious 
comments coming from third brother-in-law, 
all resonate uncomfortably with the realties 
meeting women today.
This daring, critical kick at that experience 
of being a woman pays off. The apotheosis of 
the book’s dark and applicable portrayals is 
perhaps Tablets Girl, a “girl who was actually 
a woman,” that is one of the local outcasts in 
Middle Sister’s town due to her propensity to 
poison people. This usually takes place, most 
suitably and without retribution, in bars. 

People flee from Tablets Girl, people watch 
their drinks when Tablets Girl is around. It’s 
not just Burns’s clear allusion to date-rape 
that that is to be appreciated here, but her 
spiked humor and exaggeration also.
This is not to reduce “Milkman” down 
to a forced, constricted focus on gender-
politics though. Burns’s writing alone is 
remarkable (something I refuse to say 
passively). “Milkman” is brimming with 
endlessly 
long 
paragraphs, 
lose-your-
train-of-thought stretched sentences and 
digressing thoughts from Middle Sister that 
render the book incredibly complex. At first, 
I was perturbed by this formal and royal-
esque writing, especially upon an encounter 
with a paragraph spanning four, almost five, 
pages. But as I continued, I found myself 
— in an unlikely way — reading Middle 
Sister’s voice in an uninterrupted pattern 
even more critical and translucent than I 
expected possible. This is assisted by Burns’s 
near-perfect draw of synonyms through the 
book, making her writing appear dependably 
careful and personal.
I was enamored by the characters in 
“Milkman” and the abrasive humor that was 
tacked onto them. It isn’t often that I get a 
full cast of characters (narrator, antagonist, 
family) that are so real, so exciting to 
encounter. Most memorable are the “wee 
sisters,” Middle Sister’s three younger 
sisters who, despite their young ages, are 
infatuated with topics such as French 
revolutionaries, 
going 
through 
“Kafka 
phases” and eavesdropping every moment 
they get. Characters like the wee sisters offer 
unexpected gratification along Burns’s dark 

timeline of events. The real humor displayed 
make “Milkman” all the more authentic and 
pleasurable.
I love “Milkman” because it is a fruitful 
attempt to offer me hints of a human 
experience I will never be able to understand, 
let alone be familiar with. Perhaps the most 
evocative and vivid account in the vein of 
social-rebellion and unwanted-gaze I have 
ever encountered, “Milkman” is a narrative 
that has been told repeatedly, even frequently 
in the 21st century. Burns’s unequivocal 
writing turns this narrative into a fearsome 
chant, one well worth shouting along to.

A timely throwback
to Burns’s ‘Milkman’

Ambry Thomas details recovery 
process before season-opener

Fans 
have 
known 
about 
Ambry 
Thomas’s 
offseason 
plight. They saw his triumphant 
return, featuring an interception 
in the season-opener against 
Middle Tennessee State. They 
even briefly heard from Thomas 
himself about what it meant to 
see the field once again after 
recovering from illness.
But on Monday afternoon, 
Thomas revealed even more 
about the depths he found 
himself in over this summer, the 
massive hurdles he was forced 
to overcome on the road to 
recovery from colitis — a chronic 
inflammatory disorder in the 
colon — and the real threat it 
posed to his junior season.
“If you know me, you know 
I’m a fighter,” Thomas said. “If 
nothing’s not seriously bad, I’m 
not gonna let health stop me 
from doing what I love.”
It all started in mid-June, 
when Thomas felt something 
was off. He explained how 
he felt to his doctor and then 
went to the emergency room. 
It was there he learned of the 
colitis diagnosis, and slowly, 
the ramifications came trickling 
through his head. 
His focus in that moment 
squared entirely on potentially 
jeopardizing his junior season. 
“(The doctors) told me what 
was going on in my stomach,” 
Thomas said. “They told me my 
chances for playing this season 
were slim to none. All the doctors 
said that. I was the only one on 
my own side, like, ‘I’m playing 
this season no matter what.’
Thomas knew this year was 
always set to be a pivotal one 
in his progression. With the 
departure of David Long to the 
NFL Draft, Thomas was next 
in line to assume the starting 
cornerback 
position 
opposite 
senior Lavert Hill.

That’s 
why, 
sitting 
in 
a 
hospital bed in June, Thomas 
began to feel despair. He spent 
three weeks laying in bed, 
unable to do anything else. He 
lost 35 pounds. This was not how 
the most important summer of 
his life was supposed to go.
“The first three weeks I was 
literally just depressed, laying in 
bed,” Thomas said. “Then that 
last week, when I started seeing 
improvement, my mom started 
making me get up, get active. 
There are some staircases right 
by the hospital outside, so I hit 
them. I walked them, I couldn’t 
run them.
“I was very weak; my legs 
were cramping. I couldn’t get 
halfway up the steps. Like, it was 
bad.”
Steadily, he began to regain 
his strength and gain back the 
weight; 
the 
self-confidence 
followed suit. While the doctors 
remained 
steadfast 
in 
their 
recommendation of a redshirt, 
Thomas had his eyes on the start 
of the year.
At times he wasn’t in the 
building with the team, he was 
working out with his dad at 
Planet Fitness. Coaches and 
teammates remained dubious 
about his playing status, but 
Thomas was determined.
Sure enough, when Michigan 

kicked 
off 
against 
Middle 
Tennessee State on Aug. 30, 
there he was, lining up with 
the 
starting 
defense. 
His 
interception tied a bow on a 
night that, just weeks prior, 
seemed incomprehensible. 
“Everybody’s just thrilled for 
Ambry. I thought that was just 
a wonderful thing,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said on the 
following Monday. “He spent a 
lot of time in the hospital this 
summer, but to go out and get 
the interception, get the fumble 
recovery, make the tackles and 
the TFL, all the things he did in 
the game was really inspiring for 
the ball club.”
His presence has steadied 
a 
secondary 
that 
otherwise 
would’ve been in flux. Heading 
into a season-shaping clash 
against 
Wisconsin, 
concerns 
among that group are few and 
far between.
More importantly for Ambry 
Thomas, 
though, 
he’s 
back 
to doing what he loves at the 
level he expects. Gone are the 
days of hospital beds and slow 
walks. Full-speed practices and 
positional meetings are where 
he thrives.
Asked how he feels now, 
Thomas looks up and flashes a 
smile.
“I’m feeling great.”

Junior cornerback Ambry Thomas was diagnosed with Colitis in June.

‘M’ prepares for test at Wisconsin

It’s that time of year where 
people start to break out the 
stats. You know, like these ones:
Michigan 
hasn’t 
won 
as 
the underdog since 2013. And, 
Michigan hasn’t won in Madison 
since 2001.
So of course, those stats were 
a hot topic of conversation at 
Monday’s 
media 
availability 
going into Saturday’s matchup 
with Wisconsin. Michigan did 
its best to tune them out.
“Do you feel like an underdog 
going into this game?” a reporter 
asked 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh.
His response: “It’s irrelevant.”
It doesn’t help the Wolverines 
that the Badgers are ranked No. 
1 in the country in both total 
defense and scoring defense. 
They 
beat 
their 
first 
two 
opponents, Central Michigan 
and South Florida, by a combined 
score of 110-0. They have a sour 
taste in their mouth from a loss 
in last year’s matchup. And, 
like Michigan, they’re well-
rested and coming off a bye. 
Beating them will be no easy 
task, especially for a team that’s 
had its fair share of offensive 
struggles so far.
But perhaps the Wolverines 
have a built-in advantage in 
preparing for that. If you look 
at SP+, a comprehensive team 
evaluation 
stat, 
it’s 
actually 
Michigan’s 
defense 
holding 
the top spot. As senior guard 
Ben Bredeson put it, “it’s tough, 
and it’s tough going against 
our defense, too.” And the 
Wolverines have the advantage 
of knowing they’ll be the biggest 
challenge yet for the Badgers’ 
inexperienced quarterback Jack 
Coan.
The Wolverines know they 
have a history of starting slow 
on the road — it doomed them 
last year in a loss to Notre Dame 
and almost did the same at 
Northwestern. So the coaching 

staff targeted it specifically in 
practice.
It’s 
impossible 
to 
fully 
simulate the environment at 
Camp Randall Stadium, but 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
gotten 
as close as they can, piping in 
crowd noise so that it’s harder 
to 
communicate, 
harder 
to 
hear playcalls. Michigan has 
an experienced offensive line, 
many of whom have played at 
Camp Randall before. Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
faced some of the toughest road 
environments in the country in 
Alabama and Auburn during his 
days at Ole Miss.
“They got a very energetic fan 
base there,” said Bredeson. “ … 
There’s definitely a lot of red out 
there in the stands and it’s gonna 
be, everyone’s very passionate 
about their team in Madison.
“I always found those games 
fun, where you get to go to the 
venues that are so passionate 
for their own teams, and even 
if it’s loud against you, it’s just 

the energy, everybody can kind 
of feed off it, but it does provide 
some challenges.”
Wisconsin has some new 
personnel on the defensive side, 
but the scheme is very similar 
to last year’s — when Michigan 
blasted the Badgers to the tune of 
a 38-13 win. The Wolverines have 
already watched the Wisconsin’s 
film from both this year and last 
and put together a game plan.
Michigan’s 
the 
underdog, 
and has struggled to win in 
that situation. That much is 
undeniable. But the Wolverines 
aren’t viewing the game through 
that lens.
“They put on their pads just 
like us,” said senior tight end 
Nick Eubanks. “We know they’re 
a tough team and we know 
they’re gonna put up a fight 
especially with us, especially 
what 
happened 
last 
year, 
they’re gonna put up a fight. 
So we’re going down swinging 
too, so we’ll see how it turns 
out.”

Following decision to return, Lockwood prepares for senior season

Mel Pearson sat across the 
table from Will Lockwood, 
waiting for the words that 
would define expectations for 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
upcoming season. 
Pearson’s nerves crept in 
with every word Lockwood 
said, but they had already been 
there the moment the senior 
forward called to arrange the 
meeting. 
Pearson 
knew 
what 
was 
coming. He had done this before 
when former defenseman Quinn 
Hughes called him last year to 
talk about his decision to return 
for his sophomore season. Back 
then, Pearson’s hopes had come 
true with Hughes returning. 
Lockwood seemed to suggest 
a different outcome.
“I’ve been in many, many of 
these meetings about players, 
talking about whether coming 
back or leaving early,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“And I just felt he was leaving.”
Lockwood’s tone and delivery 
was as solemn as could be. 
“Coach, 
I’ve 
come 
to 
a 
decision. I’ve made a decision.” 
Pearson 
recalled 
Lockwood 
saying. “... I’ve decided I want 
to come back and finish. Finish 
something that I started that I 
haven’t done yet.”
The decision to return for 
his senior season didn’t come 
easily; it never seems to. But 
with Lockwood especially, a 
lot of things came into play. 
The Wolverines came into last 
season with high expectations, 
coming off a Frozen Four run 
that he missed with a shoulder 
injury, and looked to continue 
that success. But, a 13-16-7 
record brought them back to 
reality and a loss to Minnesota 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
ended any hope of extending 
the season.
“When the season ended, I 
didn’t even really start thinking 
about it for maybe a week,” 
Lockwood said. “Just because 
we didn’t really finish the way 
we wanted to, and it was kind of 

a disappointing finish the year.”
The process took several 
weeks. Not wanting to make 
a 
choice 
he 
might 
regret, 
Lockwood took 
his 
time 
and 
evaluated 
all 
factors. 
The 
2018-19 season’s 
disappointing 
result 
was 
one, 
but 
his 
readiness for the 
next level and 
his 
education 
got taken into 
account.
“He 
made 
an 
educated 
decision,” Pearson said, “got all 
the information on the facts.”
His decision came over the 

course of two to three weeks in 
March. There was no urgency 
with the Vancouver Canucks — 
the NHL team that drafted him 
in 2016. 
Though 
Pearson 
and 
the 
Michigan 
coaching 
staff 
took 
a 
hands-
off 
approach, 
he 
approached 
them 
several 
times 
with 
questions 
and 
concerns. 
He 
went 
around 
asking friends, family — anyone, 
really, who he had a hockey 
connection with growing up — 
on what he should do. 

“I kept having my mom tell 
me to get my degree,” Lockwood 
joked. “But, other than that, I 
took my dad’s advice, he’s been 
a role model for 
me 
my 
whole 
life. And he was 
the one who just 
told me to kind 
of 
stick 
with 
what feels right 
and what feels 
comfortable.” 
And 
then 
a 
random morning 
in 
the 
spring, 
Lockwood woke 
up and just knew. 
He raced to tell his dad, and 
then, immediately after, called 
Pearson.

“(Lockwood) wanted to come 
back for a reason,” Pearson 
said. “With a purpose in mind, 
not just to come back. But come 
back 
with 
a 
purpose of No. 1, 
making sure he’s 
more ready than 
he was last year 
to go pro. And 
then 
obviously 
to 
finish 
his 
degree. 
And 
then No. 3 is to 
help us to get 
back to where 
we need to go.”
An injury sidelined Lockwood 
much of his sophomore season 
— that year, the Wolverines 
pulled together a Frozen Four 

run. Instead of celebrating with 
the team on the ice after a 6-3 
win over Boston University that 
propelled them to the semi-
finals, Lockwood watched from 
behind the glass — secluded 
and unable to claim the team’s 
success as his own.
“He’s kind of battled with 
some 
injuries 
and 
missed 
some games and missed a good 
portion 
of 
our 
sophomore 
season,” said senior forward 
Jake Slaker. “I think that hurt 
him a little bit, especially 
because we made such a good 
run.”
“I wasn’t really too satisfied 
with that,” Lockwood said. 
“And I wanted to be a leader 
on the team and come back and 
have a little more success senior 
year.
His impact as a player was 
never in question. Recipient 
of the Hal Downes Trophy 
and Dekers Club Award, team 
awards 
for 
most 
valuable 
player and top freshman, he 
had earned his stripes as one 
of the team’s best his freshman 
year. He scored 20 points in his 
rookie year campaign and had 
tallied 11 points in 16 games as 
a sophomore before concluding 
his season with an injury.
“I know if he was out there 
with us,” Slaker said. “maybe 
we would have the National 
Championship.” 
And after Michigan veered 
off its projected course with 
a sub-.500 season in 2018-
19, Lockwood felt the need to 
come back, to help rectify the 
disaster of a season. And as the 
Wolverines’ 100th captain and 
a leading force on the team, he 
hopes to do “big things with 
this team.”
It’s a title he’s earned and 
an expectation he’s sought. 
Instead of Canucks training 
camp, fighting for a roster spot, 
Lockwood 
spent 
this 
week 
opening Michigan’s practice 
donning the Captain’s ‘C’ for 
the first time.
“At the end of the day,” 
Lockwood said, “it kind of came 
down to what my heart was 
telling me.”

(Lockwood) 
wanted to 
come back for a 
reason.


On May 25, two girls 
dressed in matching 
white tops and navy 
skirts took their posi-
tions to play doubles in 
a tennis match in Or-
lando, Fla.
But these were no ordi-
nary girls, no ordinary 
outfits and, certainly, no 
ordinary match.
It was the final evening 
of the NCAA Division 
I Men’s & Women’s 
Tennis Tournament. The 
two girls that stepped 
onto that court each had 
already made history 
in their own ways and 
were hungry for one 
final mark. The white 
shirts they donned were 
emblazoned with a 
block ‘M’, a symbol that 
connected them to the 
University of Michigan. 
And as the first serve 
flew over the net, Bri-
enne Minor and Kate 
Fahey were officially 
competing for a national 
championship. 
Together. 
One last time. 
***
Brienne Minor, from 
Mundelein, Ill., started 
her career at Michigan 
as a sought-after high 
school recruit. She got 
serious looks and gave 
strong consider-

ations to other esteemed 
programs such as UCLA 
and Northwestern. But 
on Nov. 13, 2014, Minor 
verbally committed to 
play for the Wolverines, 
and thus began her illus-
trious collegiate tennis 
career. 
As a freshman, she was 
All-Big Ten and a 2016 
ITA All-American in 
singles and in doubles, 
which made her only the 
second player in school 
history to earn both 
honors.
In her sophomore sea-
son, Minor made his-
tory. 
She was crowned the 
2017 NCAA Singles 
Champion.
Not only was she the 
first in program history 
to achieve such a feat, 
she became the first in 
Big Ten women’s ten-
nis history to do so. 
She was the first Black 
female to ever win the 
title. The last Black 
athlete to win an NCAA 
Singles title was Arthur 
Ashe in 1995.
Bouncing back off two 
knee procedures that 
derailed her junior year, 
Minor’s senior year was 
impressive. She won the 
ITA Midwest Regionals 
title, was named All-
American in doubles 
and All-Big Ten, was 

2019 NCAA National 
runner-up in doubles, 
which shattered the 
school record for tour-
nament advances, and 
closed out her collegiate 
career as Michigan’s 
all-time leader in All-
America citations 
with four.
After she won the sin-
gles title in her sopho-
more year and sat out 
junior year recovering 
from her knee surgeries, 
Minor felt the pressure 
to perform to her highest 
caliber her senior year. 
Her team and coaches, 
however, were always 
reassuring and confident 
in her. 
“I think for (Minor), she 
wins the whole thing 
two years ago, and it’s 
a lot of added pressure 
on her to duplicate that,” 
said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein on the 
2019 Nationals com-
petition. “I mean, we 
told her, ‘You have this 
forever. You don’t have 
to live up to this every 
year, because who can?’ 
“That’s tough, in a 
sense, dealing with win-
ning (the 2017 NCAA 
Singles title) and the 
pressure that comes with 
that. And she did incred-
ible. You see how she 
helped us this year, on 

the 
court and 
off, especially.”
In her four years, Minor 
gave Michigan much 
more than records – she 
has set an example of a 
strong-willed teammate, 
competitor and friend.
***
Kate Fahey, from Fair 
Haven, N.J., was always 
one to watch. Notori-
ous for her competitive 
nature and fiery on-court 
persona, Fahey’s career 
followed suit.
Her freshman year, 
Fahey was All-Big Ten, 
went 9-0 in conference 
play, and started her 
reputation of win streaks 
with 15 straight singles 
victories during the 
2016 season. 
Hungry for more, she 
started off her sopho-
more year with a bang. 
Fahey won both the ITA 
Midwest Regional Sin-
gles and Doubles Cham-
pionships, which earned 
her an automatic berth 
to the National Indoor 
Intercollegiate Champi-
onships, where she and 
then-junior Alex Najari-
an took home the crown 
in doubles. She also 
extended her conference 
win streak in singles to 
18-0 and earned the first 
All-American honor of 
her career.
Fahey’s junior sea-
son brought her two 
Big Ten Athlete of the 
Week honors, a second 
straight NCAA Singles 
berth, an Academic 
All Big-Ten honor, a 
unanimous All-Big Ten 
selection and a 2018 Big 
Ten Athlete of the Year 
honor, among other in-
dividual achievements. 
Even amid those ac-
colades, Fahey’s se-
nior season took her to 
another level. She was a 
two-time Big Ten Ten-
nis Athlete of the Week, 
won a record 21-straight 
singles matches at 
No. 1, was an ITA 
All-American in both 
singles and doubles and 
earned a unanimous 
All-Big Ten selection. 
And, after closing out 

her 
collegiate ca-
reer as a doubles nation-
al runner-up with Minor, 
Fahey was named 2019 
Big Ten Athlete of the 
Year, Michigan’s Fe-
male Athlete of the Year, 
and is now the win-
ningest player in pro-
gram history. 
“Kate’s unbelievable 
work ethic is inspiring,” 
said assistant coach 
Teryn Ashley-Fitch. 
“I mean, it’s inspiring 
to see. I’ve never met 
anyone who loves tennis 
more than Kate. 
“I think if you talked 
to any coach in the 
country, or any coach at 
Michigan, they would 
want to have someone 
like Kate compete the 
way that she does and 
train the way that she 
does. We’ve never seen 
anyone like her before, 
and I don’t know that 
we’ll see anyone like 
her again.”
***
While their respec-
tive achievements 
and accomplishments 
aided Fahey and Minor 
in earning esteemed 
reputations and engrav-
ing their names into 
program and national 
history, it was actually 
the game they played 
together that made 
these two girls such an 
anomaly. 
Minor and Fahey were 
the duo that the Michi-
gan women’s tennis 
team had, but never 
knew it needed. The 
unlikely pairing of two 
very different, talented 
players allowed them 
to connect, win and 
play their final game for 
Michigan, as a pair, for 
a national championship 
title.
Throughout the four 
years together, Minor 
and Fahey were primar-
ily paired up with other 
teammates and per-
formed well with whom-
ever they were matched 
up. Michigan was con-
sistently ranked nation-

al-
ly in at least 
one doubles pair, espe-
cially Fahey/Najarian in 
2017, who topped the 
chart at No. 1. How-
ever, following sporadic 
losses, the coaching 
staff would shake things 
up to see who would 
click, knowing who had 
performed well level all 
season. 
A few times during the 
first three years, Minor 
and Fahey were paired 
up and competed at a 
high level, but the “nor-
malcy” of other pairings 
was always returned 
soon after. 
Their senior year, as two 
of the strongest players 
on the roster, they were 
placed together on the 
court for most of the 
season, once the Michi-
gan coaching staff was 
confident in the pairs 
at the No. 2 and No. 3 
spots. 
“We didn’t have (Minor 
and Fahey) necessarily 
as partners — you try 
to have three teams that 
you feel like you can get 
that doubles point,” said 
Bernstein. “This year, 
we put them together in 
the fall and then more so 
going into Big Tens and 
the end of the year. 
They know each other 
really well and I think 
they trust each other. 
I think that’s why you 
saw such good results.”
Added Ashley-Fitch: 
“I mean, they’re so 
different. In terms of 
their doubles combina-
tion, we knew that they 
were going to be a rock 
solid team just because 
of what they bring to 
the table. Kate is super 
solid, Bri is really ag-
gressive. And we knew 
they would complement 
each other, it was just 
about getting them and 
getting our team to the 
spot that we can play 
them together.”
