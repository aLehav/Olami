SUMMER OLYMPICS
Vaulting
to London
Sam Mikulak and
Syque Caesar's
journeys to the 2012
Summer Olympics
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
For the training center of two
Michigan Olympic gymnasts, the
Newt Loken Gymnastics Training
Center has an atmosphere that is
oddly calm and relaxing.
There you'll find aformer nation-
al champion warming up to Flo
Rida's "Wild Ones" on the parallel
bars on one end of the gym, smiling,
while a Team USA gymnast prac-
tices his pommel horse routine with
his Michigan. teammates and coach
cheering him on, watching his short
but muscular figure complete his
Olympic routine.
For many other colleges and uni-
versities in the United States, this
is a rare occurrence. But for Michi-
gan, this comes as no surprise. The
University has seen a current or
former student medal at every Sum-
mer Olympics since 1900.
But out ofthe138 Summer Games
medals, a gymnast has won only
one. Listening to "Wild Ones" and
joking around with your Wolverine
teammates isn't exactly the perfect
formula to medal in London,but for
Syque Caesar and Sam Mikulak,the
pressure of snatching gold is long
gone.

Brandon wary of
using marquee
for non-profit
organizations
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
On Thursday, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents met and
approved the funding and sche-
matics for multiple million-dollar
construction projects, including
a new $2.8-million marquee out-
side of Michigan Stadium.

University Athletic Director
Dave Brandon came to speak on
behalf of the request to approve
the marquee.
He said the marquee will be 21
feet above the ground at 27 feet
high and 48 feet wide. It will be
located on East Stadium Boule-
vard between Crisler Arena and
Michigan Stadium and will also
be visible from Main Street. Bran-
don said it will have speakers, but
the speakers will likely only be
used on game days.
"(It's a) pretty cool communi-
cation tool to really promote our
student athletes and our coaches,
our events and all the things that

are associated specifically with
Michigan Athletics," Brandon
said.
And yet, University Regent
Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham
Farms), expressed that she had
received e-mails from the con-
cerned members of the commu-
nity. She suggested that the board
might also be used to promote
non-profit organizations or other
segments of the University.
Brandon responded, saying he
would consider it, but that the
University should be mindful in
using the marquee.
"We have to be careful how

the country and world, we're proud
to offer a high level of care and
expertise across many specialties,"
Strong said. "There are many ways
to measure a hospital's excellence,
and we are grateful to be recog-
nized in this ranking and others."
Strong commented on the drop
in rank, attributing the move from
14th to 17th to the methodology the
magazine used to compile the list.
"There were an awful lot more
changes this year compared to pre-
vious years," Strong said.
Strong said this year's rankings
focused less on hospital reputation
among physicians nationwide than
previous years.
"What differentiated, in the
past, one organization from anoth-
er, tended to be reputation," Strong
said. - "My understanding is that
it's less important under the new
methodology and other things are
more important."
Avery Comarow, rankings edi-
tor at US News and World Report,
wrote in a July 3 article that the
attention of the hospital standings
has shifted from reputation to sta-
tistics.
"While reputation continues to
play an important role in the Best
Hospitals rankings, clinical data
such as patient outcomes and pro-
cesses of care have become cen-
tral," Comarow wrote.
Comarow added that some
information was not available
when the list was first compiled
in 1993, but the cooperation of the

federal government and healthcare
community in releasing hospital
data has allowed for more detailed
evaluations.
Statistics including mortal-
ity and nurse staffing, along with
other measures, now make up
more than 70 percent of hospitals'
scores in most of the 16 specialties,
according to Comarow
Comarow wrote that the new
methodology provides more con-
crete and quantifiable comparisons
among the nation's besthospitals.
"(The methodology is) an adjust-
ment that continues the shift
toward judging hospitals on infor-
mation that is measurable, direct
and verifiable," Comarow wrote,
but noted that a hospital's reputa-
tion still makes up 32.5 percent of
its ranking score.
Comarow's article mentioned
that the methodology caused sev-
eral hospitals, like UMHS, to move
drastically on the list.
"The change to reputation, cou-
pled with the other methodology
improvements made this year, con-
tributed to some significant shifts
in the upcoming rankings," Coma-
row wrote.
Strong said UMHS is taking the
evaluation as an opportunity to
improve upon the care it provides.
"Our minds and efforts are
focused on improving both qual-
ity and efficiency at the same time,
and we think that if we can keep at
that, we will do well in the complex
world of rankings," Strong said.

DARK KNIGHT
From Page 10
Visually, "Rises" is the lightest
of Nolan's installments, adorned
with cinematographer Wally Pfis-
ter's ("Inception") glaring, clean
light. Tonally, it surpasses dark
and approaches cataclysmic. Never
before has a movie of this magni-
tude inflicted so much pain upon its
hero, and Bale delivers a haunting
performance as a decaying man and
ticking timebomb.
Moments of lightness are
brought by Hathaway's knockout
performance. She transforms -
almost unrecognizably so - into
the dual-natured Kyle, and plays off
Bale with conviction. "Rises" offers
the most detailed and poignant real-
life manifestation of the character,
and Hathaway manages to be sexy,
manipulative, tongue-in-cheek, all
while kicking ass in her razor-blade
heels that are anything but kitten.
Also new to the crew is cop-
turned-detective Blake (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, "50/50"), whose
innocence offers a stark contrast to
the more morally gray of Gotham.
Marion Cotillard ("Public Ene-
mies") accomplishes impressive
depth with very little screentime
as Wayne Enterprises' wealthy and
mysterious board member Miranda

Tate.
Like the wounded Wayne, the
film's familiar faces are hurting
more than ever. Alfred is disil-
lusioned with Batman's madcap
self-destruction, and Caine's more
emotional scenes are heartbreak-
ing. Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman,
"Invictus") continues to whip up
the Applied Sciences gizmos, but he
too is noticeably worn by the agony
seeping through Gotham's streets.
Gary Oldman ("Titiker Tailor Sol-
dier Spy") returns as Commissioner
Gordon, who is just as tormented
as the man in the mask, but lacks
the luxuries of an alternate"iden-
tity to protect the ones he loves (not
to mention a fortune and a secret
lair). He's a tangible hero, one that
Gotham truly deserves, and Old-
man once again churns out a heavy
performance.
With this trilogy and "Incep-
tion," Nolan has proven himself a
maestro of creating vivid worlds. In
"Rises," the universe is so visceral
- full of characters with very real,
political motives - that it's easy to
forget that this is still a comic book
tale. "Realistic" is different than
"believable," and while "Rises"
might notnecessarily be the former,
it has the latter on lock. Gotham
isn't just breathtakingly immersive
- it's a character as developed and

tumultuous as Batman.
Before "Rises," "Batman Begins"
and "The Dark Knight" worked
well as standalone pieces, as they
were rhythmically and thematical-
ly quite different. But now that we
have all of the pieces, it's clear that
this is one story being told in three
movements. "Begins" is steeped
in themes of family and fear and
gradually crescendos, giving way
for the raucous energy of"The Dark
Knight," Nolan's exploration of
anarchy. "Rises" is the final tragic
act, overridden with themes of jus-
tice and all-out war. No element
weaves the three parts together
better than Bale's evolving, endur-
ing performance, which brings
specificity and vitality to a role that
has been rehashed countless times.
Response to the film will
undoubtedly be divided. Clocking in
at nearly three hours and offeringa
mostly dire depiction of the human
condition, moviegoers looking for *
a fun flick are sure to find its emo-
tional weight taxing. But death and
destruction have long hovered over
this trilogy and itsuniverse, and the
weight of its monolithic conclusion
should come to no surprise.
Nolan insists his knight will not
rise again, but that's OK: The Bat-
man legend has reached its unsur-
passable peak.

we manage that, or it will turn out
to be a community billboard as
opposed to the investment we're
making, (which) is on behalf of our
fans and student athletes," he said.
The Athletic Department had
another request unanimously
approved by the Regents to appro-
priate $9 million from the Athletic
Department for a renovation and
addition to the museum portion of
Schembechler Hall, to be complet-
ed in the winter of 2014. The proj-
ect will add 7,000 square feet to the
building, renovating the existing
7,000 square feet.
The schematics for a $34-mil-
lion parking structure on Wall
Street, which were initially
approved a few months ago, were
approved unanimously by the
board as well.
The structure, which will have
725 parking spots, will be com-
pleted in 2014 and will be funded
by parking resources.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-

sity's executive vice president and
chief financial officer, explained
that parking resources amount to
the capital fund generated from
the approximately 27,000 parking
spaces on campus, among other
forms of revenue.
Regent Katherine White (D-
Ann Arbor) said the Wall Street
parking structure - which has
been discussed for several years -
drew wide criticism from the com-
munity over its aesthetics when
first proposed in 2008.
"We had a lot of e-mails and
phone calls, and people were very
upset about us building a parking
structure down there," White said:
But she added that this time,
people have been much more posi-
tive.
"It sounds to me, from what I've
seen and heard, that a lot more
was taken into account to make
the parking structure a little more
amenable to people living there,"
White said.
The Institute of Social Research.
also sought to re-approve the bud-
get for renovations on budgets
from $23 million to $29 million.

Slottow said that $15 million of
the $29 million is coming from a
grant from an agency within the
National Institute of Health.
"The grant is a real feather in
ISR's cap because NIH does not
generally make grants for capital
renewal - usually (they're) for
research," he said.
Earlier in the meeting, the board
listened to a 10-minute presenta-
tion by George Alter, a University
professor and director of Inter-
university Consortium for Political
and Social Research, a subset of the
ISR. Alter gave a description of the
ISR, which researches a wide vari-
ety of topics ranging from politics
to druguse to consumer trends and
income dynamics, among several
others.
Lastly, the regents approved
the schematics ' for a new
78,000-square-foot School , of
Nursing building.
"It's been in planning for over
a decade," Slottow said. "This .is
basically the result of 10 years
of planning and saving to do the
project. We're ready to actually
get it done."

The reports section of the meet-
ing was relatively brief and focused
on the research report.
During the research report, the
meeting temporarily took on the
air of a physics lecture when Ste-
phen Forrest, the University's vice
president for research, explained
the University's - involvement in
the discovery of the Higgs boson
particle at the European Organi-
zation for Nuclear Research, or
CERN.
"(The University is) one of the
largest teams at CERN, and it
played a pivotal role in developing
the statistics that led to what's now
looking like the discovery of the
key particle," he said. "Michigan
played a very, very significant role
in this activity."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman took time in her remarks
to congratulate the University
Autonomy team - whose autono-
mous boat recently won a national
competition - and the University
Solar Car team, which currently
leads the American Solar Chal-
lenge in an endurance race across
the nation.

it's at its quietest when "The Dark
Knight Rises" truly astounds. It's
in whispered monologues that the
characters make their most indel-
ible, potent utterances. "A storm is
coming," Anne Hathaway's Selina
Kyle purrs.
Before that stormarrives,we're
shown a post-Batman Gotham.
Organized crime is down, and
the caped crusader once hailed
the city's hero has been made the

enemy, blamed for the death of
the man Gotham remembers as
their white knight. Eccentric bil-
lionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian
Bale, "The Fighter") has taken to
the shadows to nurse his physi-
cal and metaphysical wounds, as
his batsuit gathers dust. But Kyle
awakens Mr. Wayne to the gath-
ering storm. A calculating, cool
catburglar, she poses somewhat
of a threat, but is nothing stacked
up against the behemoth Bane
(Tom Hardy, "Warrior"). Despite
ever-loyal manservant Alfred
Pennyworth's (Michael Caine,
"Inception") deepest pleas, Bat-
man gets back in the game.
There's nothing sleek or intri-
cate about Batman and Bane's
encounters. They brawl with
brutish, bone-crunching feroc-
ity. Hardy's sheer immensity is
astounding, and Nolan's liberal
interpretation of the character
makes for one hell of a movie vil-
lain. While Heath Ledger's won-
derfully twisted Joker was an
agent of chaos, Badie is something
entirely different. He's pure evil,
a terrorist dead set on unleashing
America's worst nightmare upon
itself.

Academic presses aren't just business investments
The backbone of any distinguished university is its strong aca-
demics and gifted professors. Research journals and literature
published by a university not only strengthen its reputation as a
leading research institution, but also allow professors and graduate stu-
dents to display their work to the scholarly world. These published works
help professors gain tenure and worldwide recognition for their research
and teachings. Academic presses shouldn't be viewed as short-term busi-
ness investments by universities; instead, they should be seen as long-
term investments in the future of education and academic achievement.

wIn the mid-1970s, 20-somethings
were still applying to work for
the Big Three in droves. They had
good jobs, with
the promise
of workman's
security as
well as a retire-
ment check

at the end of 30
years. Though
Michigan no VANESSA
longer has an R
abundance of RYCHLINSKI
industrial jobs,
the automo-
tive industry is still providing the
younger generation with options,
albeit more specialized.
A group of talented young peo-
ple is entering the automotive
industry in new ways. News and
media publications aren't the only
domains turning to technology for
newer ways of doing things. Desk-
top publishing was developed 30
years ago, and since the early '90s,
Adobe programs have been used
for everything from web layout to
billboard advertisements.
The College for Creative Stud-
ies - located in downtown Detroit
- trains students in the field of
graphic designowith great success.
Luke Mack is a 20-year-old student
who's in the school's automotive
design program. Michaela Allen, in
her third year at the college, studies
graphic design. Both of these stu-
dents are talented artists who chose
to enter the field of design due to,
its practicality. Both are currently
working at design internships.
Luke works on both personal and
freelance projects and is also an
intern for General Motors this sum-
mer. "(Graphic design) is practical.
I'm making a product for people to
consume eventually, and it's kind of
about status and culture," he admit-
ted. "Cars are cultural icons. So it's
good because I like to fuse the artis-
tic side with the logical side. It's a
good mix."
Both Michaela and Luke have
created paintings that people want
to buy - Luke has a 15-foot-high
piece that J. Dilla's camp wanted
to buy for a party celebrating the
rapper's posthumously released
album. But such sales are few and
far between.
"It's hard to make it as an art-
ist," Michaela said. "Graphic design
is a much more specific skill, and'
it's more practical to learn. I didn't
realize that it would be so technical
when I first started out."-
Graphic design is a field that is
steadily gaining velocity. According
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
the U.S. Department of Labor, the
median pay in 2010 for a design-
er just out of college was around
$43,500 a year. That number is
higher than the average humanities

degree recipient just gettingttheir
start. It also doesn't account for
those professionals with specializa-
tions in product or car design, who
often have substantially higher pay-
checks. The BLS also reports that
the demand for graphics in com-
puter system interfaces and the like
will hit a 61 percent hike by 2020,
while the demand for specialized
graphics services'demand will rise
by a significantl27 percent.
Creative minds
can benefit the
auto industry.
That being said, the race for
jobs among young designers is
still fairly competitive. There are
a limited number in metro Detroit,
even though the needs for automo-
tive-related graphic services are
varied, running from body design
to interior coloration.
Certainly, it's a boon to Detroit
- and Michigan overall - that cre-
ative young people like Michaela
and Luke are working here. How-
ever, despite the fact that around
80 percent of students who intern
in an area end up in that same area,
it remains that around 50 percent
of students leave Michigan after
graduation.
One young automotive designer,
who wished to remain anony-
mous, wants to get out of the area.
The young professional discov-
ered his knack for the field while
still in high school and finds that
though Detroit has been essential
to his startrfor practical reasons,
he does wish to head west. "(Cali-
fornia) is where a lot of the auto-
motive trends happen that we see
here in the Midwest," he said.
When asked what Michigan
could offer him if he stayed, he
pointed out that if he ever wanted
to start his own business, Detroit
has the infrastructure to do so, and
cheaply. Indeed, a friend of Luke's
is currently working on a project
painting around 50 buildings, while
a well-known street artist from Cal-
ifornia named Revok recently com-
pleted a mural in Eastern Market.
"From listening to the talk of
the area, it seems that Detroit is
coming back," Luke said. In the
absence of traditional options, the
city and the rest of Michigan need
the power of the creative brain to
combat the drain.

Between the two roommates,
they have racked up a lengthy'list
of accolades to their names. Caesar
was a member of the 2010 Michigan
men's gymnastics NCAA Champi-
ons squad and won the 2011 Big Ten
title on parallel bars, while Mikulak
snagged the 2011 NCAA All-Around
Champion title. And in 2012, just
points away from a repeat, a slight
slip on the pommel horse cost him
the win.
High-profile competition isn't
a stranger for the two Wolverines,
but that isn't to say the Olympics
isn't out of their mind - it is only
when they're in the gym.
"As of late, I've been trying to
keep gymnastics-wise in the gym,"
Caesar said. "The Olymipcs are
very stressful to think about, and
even talking about it doesn't relieve
much tension."
His roommate agrees.
"If we do talk about (the Olym-
pics), it's about ppsitive stuff,"
Mikulak said. "We're trying to stay
away from any scares we could
have. Right now I feel like we both
don't even feel like it's not happen-
ing."
Both of their journeys to Lon-
don have prepared them for the
toughest, most mentally challeng-
ing competition of their lives, as the
opening ceremonies of the Olym-
pics commence on Friday.
Syque was ready to be a Gator.
He had accepted a full academic
scholarship to Florida and was plan-
ning to compete for a local club gym
in his spare time in college after an
ACL tear ended all chances of being
recruited for athletic scholarships.
Syque's junior year gymnastics
season was cut short by his injury,

and he couldn't quite recover to 100
percent during his senior year. He
struggled, and was finally accept-
ing that his competitive gymnas-
tics career would be over after high
school.
But the summer after his senior
year changed everything.
"(Michigan 'gymnastics coach)
Kurt (Golder) contacted me the
summer after my senior year,"
Syque said. "We said some words,
exchanged some e-mails ... (and) he
asked for videos."
Since
Syque wasn't
recruited,
he had no
recruiting r
videos made,
so he sent
Golder some
old YouTube
videos from
his early high
school days,
not sure of
how well
Golder would
take them.
Sam inher-
ited the genes
to be a gym- .
nast.
His parents, Stephen and Tina,
were both gymnasts at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, and Sam
began gymnastics at the age of two.
But as a child, the Corona del
Mar, Calif. native played baseball,
soccer, hockey and basketball in
addition to gymnastics.
As he got older and grew (as
much as he could), hockey and bas-
ketball were out of the question.
And soccer was too much of a time
commitment.
"My dad really wanted me to do
baseball, but I have so much more

fun competing for myself and mak-
ing sure everything's on my shoul-
ders," Sam said. "I liked controlling
all the factors, and that was the dif-
ference between gymnastics and
baseball for me."
"I can honestly say if I hadn't
come to Michigan, I wouldn't be
doing gymnastics still," Syque
said. "Looking back, I don't think
(doing club gymnastics in Florida)
would've worked out."
But it didn't have to come to that.

the risk," he said.
"Best choice I ever made."
Since age 2, Sam has dreamed of
competing at the Olympics, and his
parents were his support system, no
matter what sport he chose.
But since he chose gymnastics,
Sam could look to his parents for
words of wisdom.
"They were always just encour-
aging," he said. "They never really
gave me advice - they knew gym-
nastics is a mental sport, (and) I had
the right head
for it. I'm just
really com-
petitive."
He knew
his parents
would want
him to fol-
low in their
footsteps
at Berkeley
as another
Mikulak
gymnast.
But that
wasn't what
Sam envi-
sioned when
he visited
PATRICK BARRON/Daily the Berkeley
campus.
"Once I went there, I wanted to
get away from that," Sam said.
So why choose Michigan?
"The team, the coach, academics,
campus. Everything was so perfect
when I came here. It was so easy to
picture myself here for four years."

In December, Syque stood on
top of the world, or at least atop the
podium at the South Central Asian
Artistic Gymnastic Championships.c
He had just won the first gold
medal in international competition
for Bangladesh, taking first place on
parallel bars - what he considers
his strongest event.
And even before bearing the
international gold medal, Syque t
was a Big Ten champion in that
same event.
But he doesn't think any medal
or Big Ten title can prepare him for.
the biggest meet of his life, espe-
cially after he sustained an injury in
January.
Syque has had only a few months
to recover from a right bicep tendon
tear, but his training has already
brought him up to speed, and he's
not concerned about his physical
shape in London.
"It's more mental than it is physi-
cal," he said. "If I just stick to the
plan I've been training on ... work
until I'm tired, that's when I know
I'm ready. I'm basically at that point
right now.
"(But) it's all focusingonthe little
details now."
Syque reads the list posted on
the wall, made by former Olympian
Paul Hamm.
He's focusing on the little details:
"Do transition elements on floor, go
in front of the mirror and do all your
routines in the mirror - move your
body around mentally and envision
yourself."

Syque had been in contact with
Wolverines head coach Kurt Golder
for the summer before his freshman
year in college, and that was enough
time for Syque to change his mind.
He was giving up a full academic
scholarship at Florida to come to
Ann Arbor - out-of-state tuition
and all - to compete for Michi-
gan. Golder didn't need any official
recruiting videos to have faith in
the Florida native's natural talent.
And it didn't take much for Syque
to change his mind, either.
"That opportunity (was) worth

News that the University of
Missouri will be shutting down
its printing press in 2013 has out-
raged professors and students
alike. The $400,000 subsidy that
funds the press every school year
has been pulled by the university's
administration. Ten employees
will lose their jobs as a result of
this decision, and university pro-
fessors will have a more difficult
time publishing their work in
print. The switch to digital pub-
lishing will likely diminish public
access to certain books, as it may
be more difficult to read online
books without a subscription.
Sadly, this is a growing trend in
America - half a dozen presses
have shut their doors in the past
three years, according to a recent
New York Times article.
Academic presses play an
essential role at any university.
They allow professors to publish
their work and share their knowl-
edge with the academic world.
Without these presses, professors
won't have the same opportunity

to publish their research, and they
may have greater difficulty get-
ting tenure as a result. In addition,
the switch to digital publishing
will not only affect the profes-
sors, but also the students. Many
graduate students need to publish
their research to earn a doctorate,
and by shutting down presses and
cuttingstaff, this processbecomes
much more challenging. This
changes the course of academics
and discourages many potential
graduate students from attending
universities without presses.
Another challenge associated
with the switch to digital publish-
ing is diminished public access to
academic research and literature.
If published works aren't being
printed in hard copy, it becomes
more difficult for outside uni-
versities and scholars to get a
hold of this research without a
subscription. Not all universities
have access to scholarly journals
online, so ordering a hard copy
from popular websites like Ama-
zon.com may be the only way to

obtain published literature.
The growing trend of shutting
down academic presses is a seri-
ous problem that colleges across
the nation are facing. University
leaders need to realize that these
presses are not solely a business
investment, but rather an invest-
ment in scholarly research and the
future of higher education.
At the core of prestigious uni-
versities lies the scholarly work
and research that professors
publish to share with the world.
These articles connect universi-
ties and help us to move forward
as an educated society. We need
academic presses on college cam-
puses so professors and students
can display their works and help
strengthen the reputation of their
university. Presses are necessary
to create hard copies of literature
that the public can more easily
access. We need university leaders
and administrators to step up to
the plate and accept that academic
presses are essential to a thriving
academic community.

FOOTBALL
Saban talks Michigan,
Cowboys Classic

OF TUBALL
'M' snags six standouts for 2013

DYLAN CINTI I V OINT
How not why

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The countdown to the 2012
'Cowboys Classic' season opener
between Michigan and Alabama
in Arlington, Texas is slowly tick-
ing down, but the discussion is
already ramping up.
With fall practices just around
the corner, football is about to
take the main stage once again.
At the SEC Media Days in
Hoover, Ala., Alabama coach Nick
Saban acknowledged that the sea-
son opener will be a stiff test for
the reigning national champion
Crimson Tide.
"I think playing a great oppo-
nent like Michigan the first game
of the season really enhances your
players' sort of work ethic and
preparation in the off-season,"
Saban said, "because they know
they're going to play a top-notch
team right off the bat, and that's
very challenging. That's kind of
been the reasoning behind it, and
it's worked out well for us.

"But we know that Michigan is
going to have an outstanding team
and it will be a very challenging
game for us this year." .
Saban and Alabama are no
stranger to facing another ranked
team at a neutral site during non-
conference play in September.
In 2007, the Crimson Tide faced
Florida State in Jacksonville;
in 2008, they faced Clemson in
Atlanta; in 2009, they faced Vir-
ginia Tech in Atlanta. Alabama
also just completed a home-and-
home series with Penn State.
"We've had a lot of national
exposure that has really enhanced
the development of our program,
especially in the early years, by
playingneutral-site games against
very good national competition,"
Saban said.
"Now having the opportunity
to go play Michigan in Dallas,
and we're going to come back to
Atlanta and play Virginia Tech
and West Virginia in the next two
years. These are the kind of games
we look for national exposure."

In his book "Columbine", a
masterfully crafted narrative
of the massacre and its after-
math, journalist Dave Cullen
recounts the media firestorm
that unfolded in the minutes
and hours after Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold opened fire on
their classmates.
Cullen was among the horde
of journalists who converged
in Littleton, Colo. to cover the
story. But for a while no story
existed - at least not one that
made a whole lot of sense. There
was only gunfire, mass hysteria
and wild speculation about a
massive force ofshooters behind
Columbine's sealed walls.
"It was the panic and frus-
tration of not knowing," Cullen
writes, "the mounting terror
of horror withheld, just out of
view."
Why was this happening?
That question prompted a
stream of wildly extrapolative
stories hintingat ahuge conspir-
acy and propagating the (false)
notion that Harris and Klebold
were "outcasis" and "loners."
Citizens of Littleton were in
shock. They needed answers.
They needed a "why." And that's
what stories of the Trench Coat
Mafia provided. Never mind
that the "why" was false. It gave
people the comfort of being able
to point the finger.
Journalists have a responsi-
bility to narrativize tragedy. To
fill in the whos, whats and whys
of a scene. But sometimes there
are stories where no "why"
exists. Columbine was one such
story. The shooting in Colorado
on Friday is another. These are
the stories of senseless killings.
In these cases, narrativizing
is tricky business. And when
done poorly, it's dangerous.
Unfortunately, sloppy narra-
tivizing abounds.
It was on CNN, as Cullen
points out, that Columbine wit-
nesses described the Trench
Coat Mafia as "Goths, gays
(and) outcasts."
That isn't journalism; it's
fear-mongering. It's the kind
of journalism that makes you
question if everyone wearing a
long coat is packing heat. Or if
all victims of bullying will seek
bloody revenge.
I can't tell you how many
headlines I've seen in thempast
few days about the so-called
"'Dark Knight Rises' Shooting."
Most of these articles confine
discussion of "Rises" to the sur-
face. It was where the shooting
happened, thus it makes for a
convenient title. I guess I see the

logic there. And I'm not going to
take pot-shots at lazy titling.
But what are reprehensible
are pieces that turn to "Rises"
for a motive.
In a silly little piece of tragedy
porn published by the Associ-
ated Press, the anonymous writ-
er attempts to draw parallels
between, amongdother things,
the plot of "Rises" and the Colo-
rado shooting.
The article features a bullet-
point list of similarities between
"Batman" narratives and that
of the Colorado killer, includ-
ing the assertion that the movie
"features at least two scenes
where unsuspecting people are
attacked in a public venue."
In its petty and insensitive
way, the piece searches for
motive. Why'd he do it? Was he
tryingcto be the Joker? Or.Bane?
I'm not saying these weren't
the first thoughts that popped
into my head when I heard
about the shooting. It's only
natural.Someone opens fire
at a movie and you look to the
movie for answers.
But it becomes dangerous
when that kind of thinking
infects our news.
At this stage in the story,
we shouldn't be searching for
motive. Is it really that impor-
tant why the killer did what
he did? I think I know at least
one reason why: attention. And
that's exactly what he's getting
- from pieces about his musical
preferences to discussion of his
dating site profile.
Such discussions need to end.
We need to turn away from
the nonsensical person who
did this and focus, on the big-
ger question at hand: how did
someone like that get his hands
on a gun? How did he walk into
a store and walk out wielding an
instrument of death?
And knowing that, how could
Colorado Gov. John Hickenloop-
er sit in front of a camera and
claim the shooting had nothing
to do with a lack of gun control?
It has everything to do with
gun control. And that's the
most important conversation
right now.
In reporting Friday's shoot-
ing, the media owes the victims
and their families the kind of
coverage that will actively pre-
vent such senseless carnage in
the future.
Let's hope they're not too
busy tracking down the killer's
Twitter feed.

Continued gridlock

Even though the Democratic

little doubt that
the 2012 gen-

midst of the breathless media cov-
erage of the daily back-and-forth of
the presidential campaign, political
commentators aren't emphasizing
one very important detail: no matter
who wins the presidential election,
the gridlock that's currently pre-
venting pretty much anything from
getting done in Washington will
continue - or even worsen - unless
one party gains control of the White
House and large majorities in both
houses of Congress.
The Republicans in the 112th
Congress are commonly blamed for
Congress' inability to get any mean-
ingful legislation passed. In an
opinion piece for the Washington
Post, congressional scholars Thom-
as Mann and Norman Ornstein
observed, "When one party moves
this far from the mainstream, it
makes it nearly impossible for the
political system to deal construc-
tively with the country's chal-
lenges." This statement deserves
some consideration because, a#
NPR noted in April, Mann and
Ornstein "have been in Washing-
ton for more than 40 years - and
they're renowned for their careful-
ly nonpartisan positions." Ornstein
also told NPR that since President
Obama was inaugurated, "when we
did get action, half the political pro-
cess viewed it as illegitimate, tried
to undermine its implementation
and moved to repeal it."

According to federal court
records, Stephen Jenson, a Uni-

on June 26.
Jenson's preliminary exam

Matthew Roth, the lawyer

the charges, the case is taken in
front of a judge rather than face
a grand jury to determine what
charges will be brought against
the person in question.
"Normally we go in front of a
grand jury to get an indictment
that we use for trial or plea," Roth
said. "The defendant can waive
grand jury and say, 'I will con-
cede that if you presented this
evidence before a grand jury, they.
would indict on this offense.' And
that's actually what happened."
He explained that the case is
now on its way to a judge.
"We didn't have a court hear-
ing on the preliminary exam
because we filed an information,"
Roth said. "He waived the right to
be indicted by a grand jury and it
got assigned to a judge."
However, it's unknown as to
when the case will be heard by a
judge.
"There's no dates pending right
now, and that's only because ... it
usually takes them a little bit of
time once the defendant has had an
information filed to come up with a
scheduling order," Roth said.
A complete review of the
forensic evidencee-ecomputers,
thumb drives and other
technology involved in the case -
by the defendant and plaintiff had
been postponing the preliminary
exam, but Roth said that process
is now over.
"All the forensic evidence is
completed," he said.
According to the acknowl-
edgement signed by Jenson and
his lawyer, Raymond Cassar,
Jenson potentially faces a multi-
year prison sentence and up to
$500,000 in fines.
Specifically, if Jenson is
convicted of receipt of child
pornography, he faces a minimum
of five years and a maximum of 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
If he is convicted of posses-
sion of child pornography, he can
be sentenced to up to 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
Jenson is currently out on a
$10,000 bail.

KPMG recognizes
'U' for first time in
high-profile report
By KAITLYN BYRNE
For theDaily
The University's C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospitals were recently
showcased as two of the top urban
infrastrutcture projects from all
over the world in Infrastructure
100: World Cities Edition byKPMG
International, an audit, tax and
advisory services firm.
KPMG's high-profile report
chose the University as one of only
14 featured structures from the
U.S. in the rankings, looking spe-
cifically for infrastructure proj-
ects that transform -their cities
into "'Cities of the Future' - places
where people want to live and do
business."
Five regional judging panels,
comprised of infrastructure con-
noisseurs from around the world,.
were asked to discuss and debate
each nomination based on innova-
tion, impact on society, technical or
financial complexity,business-plan

feasibility and scale.
Designed by HKS Architects,
Inc., Mott and the Women's Hospi-
tal received Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design Silver
Certification during construction,
with verification from the Green
Building Certification Institute
that they are a high-performance
green building.
Jackie Lapinski, project man-
ager for the University's Health
System at Mott, said eco-friendly
habits started at construction, add-
ing that the building was designed
to run effectively for at least SQ
years.
"As we created waste, we made
sure that we handled it very effi-
ciently all the way through," Lap-
inski said.F
The LEED certification verifies
that the hospitals have energy-con-
serving features, water-conserving
features, reduce carbon dioxide
emissions and improve indoor air
quality.
Some of the hospital's sustain-
able features, such as its "green
roof" and recycled rubber floors,
were vital facets of infrastructure
that attracted KPMG's attention,
accordingto Lapinski.
"This is an award that we did not

Monday, 23.2012
The Michigan Daily - michigandaily com
Mott, Women's hospitals in top 100 for infrastructure

pursue - this is something where
the industry went out and surveyed
new construction projects to find
places that were innovative and
inspiring, and we feelveryhonored
to be named as one of (the build-
ings) with those criteria," Lapinski
said.
Since the completion of the
new hospitals in December 2011,
Mott now offers 348 beds, 50 pri-
vate maternity rooms and 46 pri-
vate Newborn Intensive Care Unit
rooms.
Totaling 1.1 million square feet
with a 12-story inpatient wing and
nine-story outpatient wing, the
original expectations discussed for
the new facility prior to the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents' approval of
its schematic design were exceeded
in bed count and overall spacious-
ness, according to their website.
According to Loree Collett,
associate director of the medical
center, designing the hospital with
the intention of maximizing the
number of rooms with windows
was tricky.
"What's unique about our build-
ing is when you look at the rect-
angular piece of land that it's on,
we had to be very creative to cre-
ate a window view for all of our

patients," Collett said. "We knew
how many beds we wanted to have
in our hospital, and in order to
accommodate that, we ended up
with two curves in the building."
The new children's hospital is
equipped with private inpatient
rooms, each approximately 300
square feet with sleep amenities
intended for use by parents staying
overnight.
Along with an outdoor garden
park, family workout room and
indoor playground, Mott provides
a new in-hospital Ronald McDon-
aid House offering 12 rooms with
private baths for visiting families.
Located within Mott, the Wom-
en's Hospital birth center allows
newborn intensive care and pedi-
atric sub-specialists accessibility to
mothers with high-risk pregnan-
cies.
Tony Kinn, judging panelist for

the North American region, said
the judges look beyond specifici-
ties of the buildings to things such
as need for the project and future
benefits that can come from the
project.
"(We wanted) projects that had
a very cogent and tangible benefit
for a given area," he said. "It's not
just building a building; it's build-
ing a huge benefit package for the
citizenry."
Kinn added that many of the
qualities of the University's hos-
pital were conducive to commu-
nity contribution, rating it highly
among the other projects.
"I think it had the potential
to expand - the benefits, the
new technology - in a way that
exceeded what other people were
doing," Kinn said. "I liked Michi-
gan because it had a chance to keep
expanding."

No Thai! location to move to Landmark

Owners to keep
old location, new
purpose still
undisclosed
By ERIC GABBARD
Daily StaffReporter
Students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents alike can look forward to a
newer, larger No Thai! restaurant
this fall.
No Thai! was locally founded in
2005 and is co-owned by Jeff Cho,
Brian Kim, Victor Kim and Noer-
ung Hang. The restaurant serves
various Thai dishes such as drunk-
en noodles and pad thai curry.
The 1317 S. University Ave. No
Thai! will be relocating to the first
floor of the Landmark apartment
building, which is located at 1300
S. University Ave. and is currently
under construction.
Along with the S. University Ave.
restaurant, there are two addition-
al locations in Ann Arbor - one on
Fourth Avenue in Kerrytown and
the other on Plymouth Road - and

one location in East Lansing.
Ann Arbor resident Rashid
Khan, general manager of the
South University No Thai!, said the
primary reason for the change in,
locationisto expand the size of the
restaurant.
"In the fall, we are looking to
accommodate more customers and
have a nicer sitting-down space,"
Khan said.
Khan added that the new loca-
tion will be slightly bigger than the
No Thai! restaurant in Kerrytown.
The new space is expected to be at
least 1,400 square feet.
With an increase in the size,
Khan said he anticipates an,
increase in the volume of custom-
ers that visit the Landmark No
Thai! as well
While the lease for No Thai!'s
new location has already been
signed, Khan said the current hold-
ers of the S. University Ave. loca-
tion aren't selling the lease on the.
property, though Khan didn't dis-
close specific plans for the space.
"We're keeping our current
location - something new is going
to be there," Khan said.

According to AnnArbor.com,
Landmark will be a 600-bed,
14-story apartment building that
is projected to open this fall. The
building will have rooms ranging
in size from studios to six-bedroom
spaces, and will have amenities
including a fitness center, theater
and study lounge.
Out of five total retail spaces
available on the first floor of Land-
mark, Khan said a Tim Hortons
and 7-Eleven are two likely addi-
tions to this space.
Pharmacy student Mike McCor-
mick said he'll probably visit No
Thai!'s new location as frequently
as he does the S. University Ave.
restaurant. He added that with the
number of students moving in right
above where the new No Thai! will
be, he thinks business will increase
for them.
"It sounds exciting - the bigger
the restaurant the better," McCor-
mick said.
The restaurant is expected to
open following the completion of
the apartment building, which
is planned to occur at the end of
August.
