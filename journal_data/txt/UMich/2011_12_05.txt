Wolverines headed to second
Sugar Bowl inprogram history

In eight hours, 170
patients transfer
to women's and
children's hospital
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
One-hundred and seventy
patients traversed an indoor
passageway yesterday connect-
ing the old C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital as the hos-
pitals' new $754 million home
opened for business yesterday.
Over an eight-hour period,
170 patients from every depart-
ment of the hospital made the
transition to the 348 inpatient
rooms, 50 maternity rooms, 48
neonatal intensive care rooms
and 16 operating rooms in the
new building.
The outpatient facilities will
continue to be transitioned into
the new space throughout next
week. Once the move is com-
plete, the old hospital facility
will consist of single rooms for

adult patients.
The transfer process began
last Wednesday when hos-
pital staff started categoriz-
ing the patients by severity of
symptoms in order to move
individuals with more serious
conditions first, according to
University spokeswoman Mar-
garita Wl.agerson. Last Satur-
day night, staff members began
preparations for the transition
and slarted to move patients
yesterday morning at 7 a.m.
Patients in the newborn
intensive care unit and children
in other intensive care units
were moved into the new space
first. The last patient settled in
by 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon.
Kara Gavin, University
of Michigan Health System
spokeswoman, said the most
impressive aspect of the project
was its scope.
"I was walking around the
building in the hours before the
different areas started to move
and it's amazing that even as big
as this building is, everything is
ready," Gavin said.

Italian gov't develops new
plan to boost economy

Growth package
awaits approval
from Italian
Parliament
MILAN (AP) - Premier
Mario Monti said yesterday his
government of technocrats has
approved a package of auster-
ity and growth measures worth
euro30 billion ($40.53 billion) to
"reawaken" the Italian economy
and help save the euro common
currency from collapse.
The measures include immedi-
ate cuts to the costs of maintain-
ing Italy's bulky political class
as well as significant measures
to fight tax evasion, Monti told
a news conference following a

three-hour Cabinet meeting.
As part of the political cost
cuts, Monti said he would fore-
go his salaries as premier and
finance minister - a move he said
was a personal decision and not
meant as an example for other
ministers in the government,
which was formed 2 1/2 weeks
ago after Premier Silvio Berlus-
coni's resignation under market
and political pressure.
The package also includes
measures to spur growth and
competition, while aiming to
stamp out rampant nepotism. But
it also raises the retirement age
and the number of years of ser-
vice to qualify for a full pension,
steps strongly opposed by unions,
and imposes new taxes on Ital-
ians' private wealth, including
their homes, boats and luxury

cars, measures that conservatives
have protested.
"We gave alotofweightto fair-
ness, we had to distribute some of
the sacrifices but we took a lot of
care to distribute them in a fair
way," Monti said.
Monti will outline the mea-
sures today in addresses to both
houses of Parliament, which must
approve them. Monti said he will
appeal to lawmakers' sense of
responsibility.
The Berlusconi government
stepped down due to its failure
to get tough measures through
a fractious Parliament, which
remains intact, meaning fault
lines could easily reopen.
"A lot depends on how well
or not we explain to the citizens
what we are trying to do," Monti
said.

DETROIT
From Page 1A
Day, a service event that usu-
ally draws more than 1,000 stu-
dent volunteers to Detroit.
Albert Rush, pastor of the
church, said the One Stop Shop
program has a different focus
than many other charities, and
one of its main goals is to provide
the disadvantaged with neces-
sities such as clothing and food,
while upholding their dignity
and honor.
"What we want people to dois
when they walk out the door, to
know that somebody cares about
them," Rush said. "We think
we're volunteering for them, but
it gives us a chance to show our
humanity."
According to Rush, the Detroit

partnership and church have
been collecting food and clothes
for the event in both Ann Arbor
and Brightmoor since August.
"We want people to get good
quality stuff," Rush said, "Not
just stuff that's thrown there,
and depending on how much
inventory we have, (beneficia-
ries) can get as much as (they)
want."
Rush said the program
expected to serve about 200
people throughout the day. He
added that the tough economy
had increased demand for their
services and decreased contribu-
tions this year.
LSA senior Cassie Basler,
executive director of the Detroit
Partnership, said the program
impacts both the students and
beneficiaries involved.
"What I thought was really

moving was how honest people
were about the life experiences
they've had," Basler said. "People
come in with newborn kids, and
they don't even have a stroller."
Basler said the collection pro-
cess in Ann Arbor typically picks
up around Halloween, when
the partnership trick-or-treats
for canned food and non-per-
ishables. Later in the semester,
the group sets out colored boxes
around campus in which stu-
dents can donate clothes.
Linda Fulgham, a beneficiary
of the program, said students
were hospitable, and she felt at
home shopping at the church.
"Everything's been great,
everything's been helpful, every-
thing's been beautiful and it's
good to give to the ones that
need," Fulgham said. "Puts a lot
of smiles on faces."

Cain's announcement came a new twist in what has already

been a volatile Republican race.
Former House Speaker NewtGin-

beneficiary of Cain's precipitous
slide. Polls show Gingrich and
former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney atop the field in what
is shaping up as a two-man race
heading into earlyvotingstates.
But others, such as Texas Gov.
Rick Perry and Minnesota Rep.
Michele Bachmann, will likely
make a strong play for Cain's anti-
establishment tea party backing
as they look to rise as a viable
alternative to Romney, whose

pect in some GOP circles.
Cain said he would offer an
endorsement, and his former
rivals were quick to issue state-
ments on Saturday praising his
conservative ideals and grass-
roots appeal.
At a tea party rally in Staten
Island, Gingrich praised Cain for
bringing optimism and big ideas
to the race.
"He had the courage to launch
the 9-9-9 plan, which, whether
you liked it or disliked it, was a
big idea and started to elevate
the debate toward big solutions
and not the usual nitpicking,
consultant-driven negativity,"
Gingrich said.

Police investigate
disappearance of
girl in carjacking
Detroit's police chief says
investigators are questioning the
truth of a story that a 2-year-old
girl was kidnapped during a car-
jacking.
Chief Ralph Godbee issued a
statement yesterday saying police
are interested in "allaying some of
the fears of the public" about the
"apparent randomness" of Bianca
Jones' disappearance.
Thirty-two-year-old ex-con-
vict Dandre Lane told police Fri-
day that a man forced him from
his car and drove off with his
daughter Bianca strapped into a
seat. The car was found later with
a child seat and no sign of the girl.
On Saturday, Godbee said
Lane was in custody on unrelated
charges.

Trump selected as

Real estate mogul Donald
Trump will moderate a Republi-
can presidential debate in Iowa
a week before the state holds the
first in the nation caucuses.
The conservative website
Newsmax will host the debate,
scheduled for December 27 in Des
Moines. All the GOP contenders
have been invited to participate.
Trump announced he would
not seek the Republican nomina-
tion himself after toyingwith a bid
last spring. The host of "Celebrity
Apprentice" has remained visible
in the GOP contest, hosting many
of the candidates for meetings at
Trump Tower in New York City.,
Former House Speaker Newt Gin-
grich is set to visit Trump Monday.
Trump has also been a strong
critic of President Barack Obama
and drew considerable publicity
when he questioned the validity
of Obama's birth certificate.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
Report: Allowing
women to drive
promotes sex
A report given to a high-level
advisory group in Saudi Ara-
bia claims that allowing women
in the kingdom to drive could
encourage premarital sex, a rights
activist said Saturday.
The ultraconservative stance
suggests increasing pressure on
King Abdullah to retain the king-
dom's male-only driving rules
despite international criticism.
Rights activist Waleed Abu
Alkhair said the document by a
well-known academic was sent
to the all-male Shura Council,
which advises the monarchy. The
report by Kamal Subhi claims
that allowing women to drive will
threaten the country's traditions

of virgin brides, he said. The sug-
gestion is that driving will allow
greater mixing of genders and
could promote sex.
Saudi women have staged sev-
eral protests defying the driving
ban. The king has already prom-
ised some reforms, including
allowing women to vote in munic-
ipal elections in 2015.

Two WWII bombs

Firefighters say a massive

that triggered the evacuation
of half of Germany's western

Koblenz firefighter spokesman
Heiko Breitbarth said yesterday
experts were able to defuse the
1.8 ton bomb and a 275-pound U.S.
bomb that had been discovered
last month in the Rhine river.
He says the evacuation order
still remains in place because a
smaller smoke grenade found
nearby will be brought to a con-
* trolled explosion.

BEIRUT (AP) - The United
Nations' human rights chief
called on the international com-
munity to protect Syrian civil-
ians Friday as violence surged
across the country, with hours
of intense shooting that sent
stray bullets whizzing across
the border.
The new bloodshed came as
activists reported a grim mile-
stone in the 8-month-old revolt:
November was the deadliest
month of the uprising, with at
least 950 people killed in gun-
battles, raids and other violence
as protesters demand the ouster

of President Bashar Assad.
The U.N. estimates more
than 4,000 people have been
killed since the uprising began
in the middle of March, inspired
by the Arab Spring revolutions
sweeping the Middle East.
"In light of the manifest fail-
ure of the Syrian authorities
to protect their citizens, the
international community needs
to take urgent and effective
measures to protect the Syrian
people," Navi Pillay, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Human
Rights, told an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Human
Rights Council in Geneva.
Pillay on Thursday charac-
terized the conflict in Syria as
a civil war.

Libya that helped topple Moam-
mar Gadhafi, is all butout of the
question in Syria. But the Euro-
pean Union, the Arab League,
Turkey and others have piled
on sanctions aimed at crippling
the regime once and for all.
The EU's latest sanctions,
which were announced Thurs-
day, target 12 people and 11
companies with travel bans and
asset freezes. They add to a long
list of regime figures previously
sanctioned by the EU, including
Assad himself and high-rank-
ing security officials.
The identities of those on
the new list were made pub-
lic Friday in the EU's official
journal.
They include the ministers
of finance and the economy, as
well as army officers.

lis, the Islamist election surge in
Egypt is depressing confirmation
of a deeply primal fear: An inhos-
pitable region is becoming more
hostile still.
This sentiment has been
accompanied by a bittersweet
sense that Israel was dismissed as
alarmist when it warned months
ago that the Arab Spring - widely
perceived as the doing of liberals
yearning to be free - could lead to
Islamist governments.
Speaking for most people here,
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud
Barak called the emerging result
of the first round of parliamentary
voting in Egypt "very, very dis-
turbing" and expressed concern
about the fate of the landmark
1979 Egyptian Israeli peace treaty.
"We are very concerned," added
Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz,
who has long warned that Egypt
could potentially pose a threat.
Speaking to The Associated Press
yesterday, Steinitz expressed hope
that Egypt "will not shift to some
kind of Islamic tyranny."
Experts here, as elsewhere,
point out that political Islam
comes in varying shades of green:
The Muslim Brotherhood in
Egypt has about a 10 percent lead
over the more radical Salafists and
appears far less eager to impose a
devout lifestyle or seek conflict.
But most Israelis appear to
have little patience for such dis-
tinctions. There is a sense that
moderate Islamists are pulling off
something of a con, lulling oppo-
nents into complacency, project-
ing a seemingly benign piety to

exploit a naive public's hunger for
clean government after years of
corrupt, despotic rule. And there
is a long memory of Iran, once
friendly to Israel, where secu-
lar forces including the military
helped depose the Shah in 1979
only to swiftly be steamrolled by
fundamentalists.
"Theseupheavals are abadthing
for the modern world, for Israel,"
said Yitzhak Sklar, a 50-year-old
Jerusalem resident. "There is
something in their religion that
pushes them to extremism. Their
religion calls for murdering anyone
who opposes them."
Smadar Perry, Arab affairs
writer for Israel's top selling
Yediot Ahronot daily, bemoaned
Islam's "coming out of the closet"
in Egypt, symbolized by the "dis-
appearance of jeans-clad young-
sters in favor of (those with)
long beards and eyes ablaze with
fanaticism." Islamist rule in Egypt
under any stripe would be "a ter-
rifying problem," she wrote.
Some of the fears - for exam-
ple, that an Islamist-led govern-
ment in Egypt would mold itself in
Iran's image - may be overblown.
Iran's clerical rule is unique in
the Middle East, and the Muslim
Brotherhood stresses the idea of a
theocracy has no place in its ideol-
ogy. Instead, it says it's committed
to an Egypt that is civil, democrat-
ic, modern and constitutional.
Israeli concerns about political
Islam can be traced to its long-
standing battle against Hezbol-
lah guerrillas in Lebanon and
more recently to 2006, when the
Islamist Hamas group swept Pal-
estinian legislative elections.
The Hamas victory triggered
a process that ultimately left the
militant group, considered a ter-
rorist organization by much of the
world for its suicide bombing cam-
paigns and other violent acts, in
control of the Gaza Strip.


State could step in
to run city of Detroit

Mayor Bing insists
city is capable of
reducing its deficit
DETROIT (AP) - The idea
is extreme, even in a city accus-
tomed to fighting for survival:
Should the state of Michigan
step in to run Detroit?
The governor has taken steps
in that direction, proposing an
unprecedented move that could
give an appointed manager vir-
tually unchecked power to gut
union contracts, cut employee'
health insurance and slash ser-
vices. But city leaders bristle at
the notion. Said the mayor: "This
is our city. Detroit needs to be
run by Detroiters."
If it happens, Detroit would
be the largest American city ever
taken over by a state. Michigan
has seized control of smaller
struggling cities, but until now
Detroit was always off-limits.
That changed this week,
when Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's administration said it
would begin a review of Detroit's
precarious finances. If the gov-
ernor concludes that the city's
economic situation constitutes
an emergency, he could dispatch
a manager who could push the
mayor and city council to the
sidelines.
It's not clear how everyday
services like trash pickup and
bus routes would be affected;
but the fixer's mission would be
clear: Do whatever it takes to
stop the bleeding.
Democratic Mayor Dave Bing
says Detroit doesn't need the
help. He insists the city is reduc-
ing a $150 million budget deficit
and easing cash-flow problems
on its own.
"We know what needs to be
done, and we stand ready to do
it," an indignant Bingsaid.
The financial review starts
Tuesday and may last up to 90
days, meaning a takeover could
be under way by the end of Feb-
ruary.
The same fate has befallen
other cities.
Atlantic City agreed in 2010

to let New Jersey take over its
finances in an arrangement that
allowed the city to spread a $9.5
million deficit over five years,
sparing homeowners and busi-
nesses a significant property
tax increase.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom
Corbett signed a law in October
enabling a takeover of Harris-
burg.
New York City had a brush
with bankruptcy in the mid-
1970s, but the rescue package
put together by then-Gov. Hugh
Carey stopped short of a full
state takeover.
"It terms of a city, I think
Detroit stands alone," said
Michael LaFaive, director
of fiscal policy at Michigan's
Mackinac Center for Public
Policy, anonpartisangroup that
espouses free markets.
An emergency financial
manager would have the power
to privatize utility depart-
ments, as well as the bus system
and other agencies. A manager
also could sell off city-owned
parking lots and even Belle Isle,
Detroit's popular island park,
LaFaive said.
That person could even cut
the pay of the mayor and city
council members.
In a 2001 report, LaFaive
wrote about Detroit's bur-
geoning fiscal problems and
recommended privatization,
contracting out services and
ways to generate revenue.
"I think they knew what the
recommendations were, but
their hands were tied a bit by
recalcitrant employee unions,"
LaFaive said. "Those kinds of
bold reforms would be difficult
to get over with the city council
or voters, in general."
Last month, Bing declared
the city government "broken"
and said the public's checkbook
would be short by $45 mil-
lion next year unless Detroit
starts saving money fast. In an
attempt to ward off an emer-
gency manager, he proposed
laying off 1,000 employees - 9
percent of the workforce - and
negotiating 10 percent pay cuts
with unions.

Federal funds will benefit AIDS research
Jn honor of World AIDS Day last Thursday, President Barack
Obama announced a plan that seeks to put a serious dent in the
transmission of HIV, and he declared that our generation "can
beat this disease." Obama pledged $50 million toward AIDS treatment
centers and research throughout the United States. This statement is
a huge commitment to a serious disease that has killed more than 30
million people since it was first diagnosed in 1982. With technologi-
cal and medical advances in this field occurring at a rapid pace, it's
important that Obama continues to reaffirm his promise to help fund

Benign bias

n my time as editorial page
editor of The Michigan Daily,
there was no more consis-
tent criticism of our page than the
constant cries of "bias." We would
try to explain to critics that bias
is kind of a necessity on opinion
pages - without it there wouldn't
be too many opinions to speak of.
But the epithet of bias is much
harder to shake when leveled at
facially objective news organiza-
tions, or divisions of a newspa-
per that are supposed to be about
"just-the-facts" - like the Daily's
news section.
Having considered the question
for a longtime, I continue to believe
that most news stories mean well.
Even in the age of Fox News and the
cable news infotainment explosion,
it's important to remember that
most news outlets that purport to
be unbiased really do try to live up
to that billing.
For example, when NBC was
owned by General Electric, and
the latter was building planes for
the American war effort, NBC's
news division faced criticism for
its apparent pulling of punches
when it came to reporting the true
disaster of the war in Iraq. It made
for an intriguing story, but it's sim-
ply not sensible to believe that an
organization that employed Keith
Olbermann for all those years was
somehow not critical enough of
the Bush administration's failure
in Iraq.
Commenting on a story in the
Daily last week, however, a reader
reminded me of a significant addi-
tional nuance to the bias-in-news
argument: There is some degree
of advocacy in every news story,
whether it's explicit enough to
annoy the average reader or not.
Even a simple decision on what
to deem newsworthy enough to

publish is a biased decision driven
by, and reinforcing, a particular
worldview.
And with that contention (which
I think rings true), I turn my atten-
tion to a story that appeared in this
paper last week: "To professors'
dismay, students still use RateMy-
Professors.com," 11/28/2011. The
focus of the story was a website
that we're all familiar with - and
the potential problems students
and professors face when students
rely on that website for informa-
tion about courses. While the story
did disclose that the Daily operates
a competing website (maizeand-
bluereview.com), several people
expressed to me some discomfort
with the story.
The main point I think the aver-
age reader would take away from
that news story is that RateMyPro-
fessors is often inaccurate (given
its penchant for extremist reviews
by outlying students), and students
would be better informed about
the suitability of classes if they
could look at the University's own
course evaluations, which are more
detailed, though not always eas-
ily available. The Daily's compet-
ing website makes those University
course evaluations more accessible
to students, thereby seemingly
being the solution to the problem
the story points out.
Perhaps some readers will find
that to be a convenient enough out-
come to indicate somethingsinister,
but I disagree. The actual answer is
simple: The thesis of the story (that
RateMyProfessors is bad) is obvious
and widely known. And the Daily
provides course evaluations on
Maize & Blue Review not because
there is some gold mine there to be
tapped, but rather because it is a
simple and obvious student service,
the likes of which this paper should

engage in.
But that's not to say that no issue
remains. Ultimately it cannot be
denied that the Daily wrote a news
story that pushed readers into a
view that reinforces a competing
service provided by this news-
paper. What I want to suggest,
however, is that isn't always a bad
thing. The only alternatives the
Daily would have had are to: 1) not
create a website like Maize & Blue
Review, which would mean there is
less information out there for stu-
dents - an undesirable outcome, or
2) not write about the significant
shortcomings of the most popu-
lar professor and course review
website - another undesirable
outcome, given that students care
about such issues.
The Daily in this case avoided
both of those silly alternatives and
picked what I think is the most sen-
sible course: Write the story, have it
say what needs to be said, and pro-
vide full disclosure.
Sarcastically extrapolating a
common conservative complaint,
Stephen Colbert famously said,
"Reality has a liberal bias." That
comedic observation hits home
because it hints just enough truth.
Some stories need to be written,
even if writing them pushes read-
ers toward a certain viewpoint.
This isn't egregiously biased jour-
nalism, rather, it's an inevitability
for a paper trying to do its job. And
there's no use denying it or hiding
it - all we can do is explain it.

research for a cure for AIDS.
About 1.2 million people live with HIV
in the U.S. Each year, nearly 50,000 people
are infected with the disease, according to a
White House statement. In Obama's address,
he stated that over the last three years, it's
estimated that the disease has increased in
young, gay, black men by 50 percent.
In 2003, former President George W. Bush
launched the President's Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief - a program that provides treat-
ment and support for the 15 countries that are
most affected by the disease. The plan cur-
rently has a budget of $48 billion, and a major
benefit of Obama's pledge is that the major-
ity of the money will be reallocated from this
existing resource, rather than taking addition-
al funds out of the government's budget.
The money will be put toward the govern-
ment's plan for expanding research, funding
medical facilities and digging deeper in pur-
suit of an eventual cure. But the funding will
not just be limited to helping to decrease AIDS
and HIV transmission. Money will also be put
toward providing antiretroviral drugs to HIV-
positive pregnant women in order to prevent
them from passing the disease along to their
unborn child. It will also fund the distribution
of more than 1 billion condoms in developing
countries around the world. These are impor-
tant measures that can help prevent HIV from
continuing to spread while people work on

finding a permanent cure.
In 2009, the International AIDS Society
announced that it will be holding the 2012
International AIDS Conference, a biannual
conference for HIV and AIDS professionals,
in Washington, D.C. Coinciding with this
news, Obama lifted a 20-year ban prohibit-
ing people from entering the country if they
were infected with the HIV virus. This event
should unite leaders and innovators from
various countries all over the world in hopes
of working together to improve global health
and medicine.
Paul De Lay, deputy director of the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids,
said in a Dec. 1 CNN article that, "2011 has
been a game-changing year, with new sci-
ence, unprecedented political leadership and
continued progress in the AIDS response."
He stressed that countries around the world
must utilize these resources and use them to
end this disease. Obama's plan is a tremendous
financial backbone that can help scientists and
doctors work toward this goal.
The AIDS epidemic is a serious public health
issue in this country and around the world.
Proper funding must be assigned to research
so that a cure can be discovered. Obama's plan
to allocate $50 million toward AIDS research
and medical treatment across the countrywill
move us even closer to this goal.

Attempts at immigration reform have been undistin-
guished at the federal level. The last serious bipartisan
effort - the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act
of 2007 - failed. Since then, states have enacted their
own legislation, which go to great extents to deter ille-
gal immigration. For example, in one of the most extreme
provisions - that was struck down inArizona, but upheld
in Alabama - officers must check the immigration sta-
tuses of individuals who they stop or arrest when they
suspect them to be in the country illegally.
Severe immigration laws like these at the state level
appear to differ drastically and unprecedentedly from
legislation previously debated at the federal level and
are gaining momentum in at least six states. These
laws are noteworthy because they come at a time when
illegal immigration to the United States is declining
dramatically.
According to Marcelo Suirez-Orozco, a professor of
globalization and education at New York University and
co-founder of the Harvard Immigration Project, since the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, illegal immigration
has significantly decreased while lawful immigration has
remained steady. But if illegal immigration is declining,
why is legislation that drastically deters it becoming more
prevalent, and what will it achieve? There's probably no
single or simple answer, but much could be understood
by considering the history of Mexican immigration tothe
U.S.
As early as the 1850s, and well into the 1920s, Mexi-
cans filled labor shortages created by the U.S.'s expand-
ing agricultural and railroad industries. Mexicans were
crucial to the American economy. Moreover, central
Mexico in the 1920s was essentially a backwater of Mex-
ico's faltering economy. As agricultural economist Paul
Taylor documented in his pioneering work, jobs there
were scarce, and those employed in agriculture could
likely earn five times more building railroads in America.
Since Mexicans could easily cross the border at this time,
many migrated.
This trend reversed when the stock market crashed
in 1929. As unemployment escalated during the Great
Depression, so did opposition to Mexicans and beliefs
that Mexicans drain the country's welfare. For several
reasons the federal government and Legislatures nation-
wide passed laws that restricted Mexican immigration.
These laws also restricted Mexicans from getting jobs,
denied them welfare when they became unemployed
and, eventually, encouraged their deportation from
the country. In cities as north as Dearborn, police were
known to coerce Mexicans to prove their legal residence
to immigration authorities - something alarmingly close

to what the current Alabama legislation requires. Byl1937,
approximately 453,000 Mexicans were deported. Then
during World War II, this trend reversed. In response to
labor shortages, Mexicans were once again recruited to
the farms and factories they left just 10 years prior.
In hindsight, the essence of pre-Depression Mexi-
can immigration policies resonated in immigration
legislation debated by Congress before the 2008 reces-
sion. The 2007 legislation, for example, would have
introduced a guest worker program and given many
illegal immigrants paths toward citizenship. The
Depression-era anti-Mexican policies were somewhat
extreme manifestations of immigration legislation
that's emerged during our recession. Though immi-
gration regulations have evolved since the Depression,
two things remain clear: when the economy roared,
policies were more lax toward illegal immigrants,
even though they came illegally. When the economy
crashed, policies became harsher toward illegal immi-
grants because they came illegally.
Considering this history, it's troubling that the
emerging harsher immigration laws come at a time
when illegal immigration is dramatically declining, ille-
gal immigrants fill a labor shortage in unskilled farm
jobs that more Americans avoid today than during the
Depression and a significant number of illegal immi-
grants come from rapidly industrializing nations that
provide far more economic opportunities for its citizens
- and therefore far less push for them to leave - than
Mexico did from 1850 to 1940.
This raises two questions. If illegal immigration is
declining as a result of the recession, to what extent
will drastic measures at the state level further this
decrease? When the economy recovers, our labor short-
age for unskilled farm jobs will rise. We will require
more migrant workers. But if the new fences staked by
emerging harsher legislation significantly curtails ille-
gal immigration, will enough migrant workers climb the
extra fences to come to the U.S., legally or illegally, when
the economy recovers? Unlike deported Mexicans who
rushed back during WWII, 21st century migrants come
from countries far wealthier than 1940s Mexico.
States that now wish to enact even harsher legislation
to deter illegal immigration need to understand that ille-
gal immigration is now both informed and complicated
by our history and our current and future economy. Per-
haps this change in complexity is the only thing that is
drastic and unprecedented about illegal immigration
reform today.

Celebrating Sturges

Among the filmmakers of
early Hollywood, one in
particular stands out:
Preston Sturges, whose legacy
comprises just 10 films he made
between 1940
and 1948,
had a career
remark-
able for its
brilliance,
brevity and
peerless inno-
® vation. In his PHILIP
time, Stur- CONKLIN
ges's body
of work was
groundbreaking, and his films,
which remain vibrant and fresh,
should not be missed.
Sturges began his career as a
Hollywood screenwriter in 1930,
and for 10 years was one of the
most successful writers in the
industry. In a time when writers
were largely marginalized and
disrespected, Sturges became
the first-ever Hollywood screen-
writer to become a director,
when he famously sold his script
"The Great McGinty" (1940) for
one dollar on the condition he
be allowed to direct. And thus
began an amazing run of bril-
liant films.
The best place to start with
Sturges is "Sullivan's Trav-
els"(1941) and "The Lady Eve"
(1941), two of his best films, and
also his most accessible. "The
Lady Eve" - about a rich but
unsophisticated scientist (Henry
Fonda, "12 Angry Men") who
falls in, then out, then back in
love with a beautiful con artist
(Barbara Stanwyck, "Double
Indemnity") - showcases every-
thing that makes a Sturges film
great: broad comedy, clever dia-
logue and elegant romance. "Sul-
livan's Travels," about a director
of comedy films who tries to
live as a hobo as research for a
social commentary film about
the downtrodden masses, is as
delightful as "The Lady Eve,"
but even more sophisticated - it
contains some lyrical scenes of
staggering beauty, and is one of
Sturges's most affecting films.
Equally great is "Palm Beach
Story," (1942) Sturges's most
iomantic film. The film follows
a young wife who leaves her

husband for Palm Beach to try
to marry a millionaire. It's an
intricately detailed film, one that
reveals new pleasures on each
viewing. "Hail the Conquering
Hero" (1944) is another Stur-
ges gem, and often overlooked.
After being discharged from
the military before even seeing
action, a young private meets a
group of Marines that helps him
return home under the guise of
a war hero. "Conquering Hero"
shows the director at the top of
his game - it's a hilarious, inven-
tive, continually surprising film
that's also one of Sturges's most
touching.
Sturges wrote some of the
funniest, cleverest scripts of the
studio era, and his films abound
with visual beauty. He operated
inside the conventions of the
screwball comedies of the time,
but elevated them to new heights
with unflagging wit and complex
narratives. But what makes Stur-
ges's films even more impres-
sive is he had complete artistic
control over his films - he had
sole writing and directing credit,
which was unprecedented. And
this was at a time when Holly-
wood was ruled by giant studios
and their powerful producers.
Sturges is one of the original
American auteurs, and certainly
the first one in the Hollywood
studio system.
But Sturges's defying of stu-
dio practices put him on thin
ice and he often clashed with
studio heads. In 1944 he made a
film called "The Great Moment"
aboutthe dentist who pioneered
the use of anesthesia, and his
struggles in the medical commu-
nity. The movie, a straight-ahead
drama, is a real departure for
Sturges and, though still a good
film, flopped at the box office,
causing a falling out with his stu-
dio. This led to Sturges forming
a partnership with millionaire
Howard Hughes, who helped
Sturges form his own studio,
California Pictures, where, as
writer, director and producer,
Sturges had even more creative
control over his films.
However, this turned out to be
the beginning of Sturges's pro-
fessional decline. He made just
one film with Hughes, "The Sin

of Harold Diddlebock" (1947).
Though nominated for the
Grand Prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, it was a flop. Hughes
meddled with the film's produc-
tion, and the result is a film that,
while very funny, doesn't quite
hold together like Sturges's pre-
vious work. When the film failed,
Hughes fired Sturges from the
studio.
After this, Sturges moved to
Fox Studios, where, though his
reputation had been irrevocably
sullied, he made his best film,
"Unfaithfully Yours" (1948).
The film is a pitch-black comedy
about a conductor who suspects
his wife of infidelity and, while
conducting a symphony perfor-
mance, imagines several revenge
scenarios. Part psychological
drama, part slapstick comedy
and part romance, the film is an
adroit satire, and Sturges's most
compelling and mature film. It
A director's
rise and fall in a
volatile industry.
flopped with both critics and
audiences in its time, but is high-
ly regarded among film scholars
today.
Sturges made two more films
after this, one in Hollywood
and one in France, neither one
successful. His improbable
meteoric rise into film stardom
was followed by an even quicker
fall into obscurity. But Sturges's
effect on the modern movie

'Jet Life' takes to the sky

Most movies try to bank on
this notion of insignificance
by offering an escape from it,
depicting the lives of extraordi-

the confines of regularity. But
"The Descendants," the latest
directorial effort by Alexan-

like most movies. It's a tender
tale of mourning and melan-

of hilarity that bring to life the
ironic imperfections of human
existence. The most surpris-

"My idea is a simulator
that simulates a fundamental
test that doctors use to assess
dehydration and peripheral
perfusion," Rajan said. "Unfor-
tunately, it's a test that many
younger doctors are bad at
doing, soI built a simulator that
simulates the test and allows
them to practice with it."
Copp said the idea can still
be improved upon, and one rea-
son he came to the summit was
to find ways to pitch the simu-
lator better.
"One of the reasons I'm here
is to try and find better ways
to explain what exactly it is

parents don't really get what

SUGAR BOWL
From Page 1A
While there were indications
that Michigan was headed for
the Sugar Bowl, due to more to
its large fanbase than its 10-2
record, its rumored opponent
changed throughout the week-
end. Houston was the most
likely, but its loss in the Confer-
ence USA Championship Game
on Saturday left the door wide
open.
"We really didn't know,"
said senior tight end Kevin
Koger. "We kept hearing differ-
ent stuff. ...We were just going
through every scenario pos-
sible, Googling all the scenarios
as each game went on."
The final announcement was

SAM in the past, it has been
increasing its role in the pro-
gram.
"Having the conference here
in Ann Arbor symbolizes our
recommitment to the Student
Association of Michigan," Wals-
er said.
This weekend's meeting drew
participants from 11 of Michi-
gan's 15 public universities. The
agenda included a wide array of
issues, including discussion on
the impact of state legislation on
students.
Gage said SAM has been
achieving tangible goals, like
aiding to defeat a bill in the
state House of Representatives
that would have cut $13 million
in funding from Wayne State
University and $18 million from
Michigan State University.
Earlier this fall, SAM started
a petition opposing the bill and
collected signatures from stu-
dent leaders at the 15 schools.
Kevin Tatulyan, vice president
of SAM and a student at Wayne
State University, also met with
state Rep. Bob Genetski (R-Sau-
gatuck), who introduced the
bill, to discuss their grievances,
according to Gage.
After the meeting, Genetski
pledged that the bill would not

Hokies, a team the Wolverines
have never played. The two pro-
grams find themselves in simi-
lar situations. The Hokies were
blown out of the ACC Cham-
pionship Game, losing their
chance at the Orange Bowl.
But Virginia Tech fell to just
No. 11 in the BCS rankings, leav-
ing them in contention. They
weren't a popular choice, as
many fans and analysts thought
teams like Boise State or Kansas
State were more deserving.
"I think there's a lot of rea-
sons why Virginia Tech would
be an attractive team to a BCS
bowl," said Virginia Tech coach
Frank Beamer in a teleconfer-
ence last night. "The number
of years we've won 10 straight
games, I think that's another
thing, the only team to do that.
leave the committee, and while
Gage said SAM cannot take full
credit for Genetski's decision,
he emphasized the ability of the
organization to influence state
legislation.
"That's a really tangible
result," Gage said. "We may not
be able to win the cuts just yet,
but let's work on smaller, more
obtainable goals. Let's work on
keeping that bill in committee
and saving $31 million."
Tyler Helsel, a SAM spokes-
man and a student at Lake Supe-
rior State University echoed
Gage's sentiments, and said
student governments now have
more of an active relationship
with state lawmakers.
"SAM has built this bridge to
where (student governments)
can go, and we can discuss these
issues with the decision-mak-
ers," Helsel said.
Jeremy Jones, a student gov-
ernment representative from
Saginaw Valley State University
who attended the conference,
said SAM works on issues that
affect both current and future
students.
"As a future teacher, I defi-
nitely want to see my students
go on to college, and obtain
degrees and have successful
careers," Jones said. "Personally,
(because) I pay for my education
myself, it's definitely important
to me that it remains affordable

Over the years I think the Vir-
ginia Tech name has gotten to
be a very good name."
Michigan has only reached
two bowls since the 2007 loss to
USC - a 41-35 win over Florida
in the 2008 Capital One Bowl
and a 52-14 loss to Mississippi
State in last season's Gator Bowl.
As questions over whether
each team deserves to make the
trip to New Orleans begin to
fade, Michigan will move for-
ward. Hoke said the team will
have the week off "a little" bit
during finals week and a couple
of days off near the holidays.
But other than that, it's back to
work.
"That Ohio game is long
gone," Hoke said. "It's been a
while ago. So we've got to look
forward and we've got to work
forward toward the bowl game."
and that I can graduate without
a lot of debt."
During the conference, MSA
introduced aresolution to oppose
a House bill that would eliminate
benefits for domestic partners of
employees at public universities
in the state.
According to Omar Hashwi,
an LSA sophomore and MSA
representative who spoke at the
conference, 570 adults and 48
children would lose benefits due
to the new legislation.
SAM passed MSA's resolution
unanimously, and it will now be
sent to lawmakers.
Despite its mission to unite
members of student govern-
ments within the state, not every
university or college in Michi-
gan has consistently sent repre-
sentatives to the organization,
and Gage said he would like to
see increased attendance in the
future so students can work
together to combat issues like
cuts to higher education.
"Regardless of the size,
regardless of the quality of edu-
cation, we're all in this same boat
together," Gage said. "If you cut
one (budget), you cut another."
According Helsel, SAM's vis-
ibility isn't widespread around
the state, but is something they
would like to improve.
"A lot of people don't know
what SAM is and what we do,"
Helsel said.

and about 300 volunteers, most-
ly comprised of members of the
UMHS community, contributed
to the effort. To ensure patients
were well fed and hydrated,
meals were provided from Plum
Market in Ann Arbor.
To make the move more
exciting for patients, the staff
developed a theme of traveling
on an airplane and provided
small gifts, such as backpacks,
blankets and coloring books.
Kathy Wade, director of
social work for UMHS, said the
theme was intended to create a
welcoming environment for the
hospital community.
"We really tried to address
it from babies to kids to ado-
lescents to teenagers that are
moving," Wade said. "And the
families, we've involved them

initiatives.
"The ability to join these
resources together in a help-
ful format for people to use for
research and inquiry is really
amazing," Green said.
The new library features
presentation and event spaces
with dual projectors, screens,
a whiteboard and seating for
more than 30 students. It also
includes nine workstations with
software for spatial and statisti-
cal analysis, data visualization
and a high-quality scanner.
"The librarians and resourc-
es help the process from start to
finish," Green said. "People can
find the data they need, can get
information for the way they
are collecting data and can cre-
ate an end point, with data com-
putation and presentation."
The library also has a maps
and materials viewing bar that
spans the length of the library.
Green said the bar provides
increased space for students to
conduct research and has moni-
tors that allow for simultaneous

access to maps, data and statis-
tical software.
"Where the maps were pre-
viously located, on the eighth
floor of the Hatcher Library,
the maps were difficult to
access and the viewing area was
cramped," Green said. "Now
with the assistance of a librar-
ian, several maps can be taken
out and viewed at once with the
large space on the table."
The library's namesake, Ste-
phen S. Clark - a 1974 alum of
the College of Engineering and
1976 graduate of the Ross School
of Business - said he donated to
the library because he valued
the libraries during his time at
the University. -
"I needed a quiet refuge to
study (in college) so that is how
I discovered the libraries," said
Clark, who is now president of
Dwyer Instruments, Inc. "They
saved my college career."
Margaret McKinley, director
of development for University
Libraries, worked with Clark in
deciding how to utilize his past
contributions to the library sys-
tem, which included providing
funding for increased techno-

logical resources in many of the
libraries on campus.
"I toured the libraries with
Stephen to show him all the
innovations his contribu-
tions have made," McKinley
said. "After several visits, he
expressed that he was thinking
about funding a new library so
we worked on ideas and decided
on combining the three units."
Clark said he was impressed
by the libraries' ability to adapt
to technological advances, par-
ticularly through the Google
Books Library Project - a col-
laboration with universities
around the nation to digitize
thousands of books and make
them accessible online - and
wanted to help facilitate growth
of its programs.
"I liked how the library was
adapting to change, rather than
hiding from it," Clark said.
"The library was embracing
the change, starting with the
Google Books Project. I liked
the idea of linking books and
sharing on the Internet - that's
how I knew the libraries would
be around for a while and would
be a good use of my funds."

Sugar Bowl berth pushes

It's not often that a team gets

"It'll just show everybody that
Michigan's back and we're seri-
ous," said fifth-year senior tight
end Kevin Koger.
Beating Ohio State was the
most important thing, but all it
did was make knocking off No.
11 Virginia Tech the next impor-
tant thing.
There will only be one college
football game that night.
At 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 3, Mich-
igan-Virginia Tech will take
center stage. Opinions across the

nation will be formed. Expecta-
tions will rise. Win and it was
no big deal. Lose and it's a catas-

as bright as it has all season -
and maybe as bright as it will
for a few years to come - Hoke
has one last chance to leave an
indelible mark on this magical
season.
What will the nation see?
Like he did with the Ohio

State game, Hoke will treat this
opportunity like a business trip.
He said he wouldn't mess with
a formula that produced a 10-2
season. Why should he change
who he is when the lights get
brighter?
The nation will be introduced
to the coach with the goofy
smile and a coaching style to

had been holding in since Nov. 5,
when his team last won against
Western Michigan.
"It's about time," Berenson
said. "We had a lot of pressure
on us and a little bit of self-doubt.
Sooner or later we were going to
get out of it, but the sooner part is
better."
With the game winner, Gup-
till tied fellow freshman forward
Phil Di Giuseppe for the team lead
with eight goals. But the biggest
tally of his young collegiate career
came with its fair share of what
Berenson calls "puck luck."
"I didn't even know it went in,"
Guptill said. "I saw everyone else
celebrating, so I figured it went
in."
That's probably because it
wasn't supposed to go in - at
least until it was re-directed by

ing zone, Guptill was there to col-
lect. He weighed his options and
fired a shot. Alaska's Adam Hen-

it, but a bad bounce sent it off his
skate and into the net.
"Obviously, it's nice to be able to
win a game on the road," Hunwick
said. "We had a bad stretch going
there. But at the same time, it's
only one win."
With the losing streak snapped,
the long plane ride home seemed
far less daunting.
And the mood in the locker
room mirrored Berenson's. Hun-
wick, too, mentioned just how
"relieving" the win was.
After all, it was the team's first
true road victory. Sure, the Wol-

'We never promised
you a rose garden'

The Michigan State foot-
ball team entered the
conference title game
dreaming of roses.
At Lucas Oil Stadium, the
Sparty bus faltered. The drive
gave out late
in a thrilling
42-39 loss to
Wisconsin in

Champion-

The NESBITT
momentary
prestige and
superiority
that fueled the engine finally ran
dry on Sunday night with the
BCS bowl selection:
Michigan State - Outback Bowl.
Michigan - Sugar Bowl.
It was a Spartan double-
whammy, courtesy of the BCS. It
wasn't fair. Michigan was beaten
fair and square at Spartan Sta-
dium earlier this season and
finished as the clear No. 2 in the
Big Ten Legends division.
"Michigan sat home tonight
on the couch and watched us,"
said Michigan State senior quar-
terback Kirk Cousins follow-
ing the loss to Wisconsin. "We
played our hearts out - you saw
it. I don't see how you get pun-
ished for playing and someone
else gets to sit on the couch and
get what they want.
"If this is the way the system
is, I guess it's a broken system."
Cousins is right, of course. It
is a broken system pockmarked
with holes and inconsistencies.
But the injustice this season just
might be payback.
On Nov. 26, 1973, an equally
flawed system crushed Michi-
gan's season.
That day, the Daily ran the
headline: "We never promised
you a rose garden: Everything's
coming up weeds!"
It was two days after a titan
clash between Michigan and
Ohio State, a pair of unbeat-
ens. They tied, 10-10. At 2:01
p.m. that Monday, the Big Ten
announced that the conference
athletic directors voted, 6-4, to
send the Buckeyes to the Rose
Bowl.
The deciding vote came from
Michigan State.
Bo Schembechler was
incensed. Michigan had earned
the right to the Rose Bowl.
"They did everything I ever
asked of them," Bo said. "They
outplayed Ohio State.
"The Big Ten will live to
regret this decision."
Bo took no time in diagnos-
ing the faults of the Big Ten
selection system - there were
grudges and biases galore.
Wisconsin's Elroy Hirsch
voted for Ohio State. Bo claimed
it was due to the Wisconsin
Athletic Department receiving
an unfavorable mention in his
book that had just been released,
"Man in Motion."

Saturday afternoon's men's
basketball game between Michi-
gan and Iowa State was a story of
unlikely heroes.
For much of the first half, nei-

Wol-
verines, 23-21, with just a few
minutes to go before the break.
Then, from the high post, red-
shirt sophomore center Blake
McLimans kicked the ball out to
junior guard Eso Akunne, who
knocked down the 3-pointer.
Neither McLimans nor
Akunne typically see much floor
time, but the pair kick-started
a 10-0 run for the Michigan
offense, and the Wolverines
went on to win, 76-66.
"It feels magnificent," said
sophomore guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. after the game. "We just feel
great to be back home in frontof
our home crowd. We just wanted
to go out there and put on a show
for our fans."
McLimans added a two-point
bucket of his own during that
run, and for good measure, the
big man nailed his own 3-pointer
on Michigan's last possession of
the half. The Wolverines (6-2)
took a 34-25 lead into the locker
room.
"The bench was really respon-
sible for that," said Michigan
coach John Beilein. "Eso came in

"Their style of defense is to

said junior guard Jenny Ryan.
"As a 3-point shooting team, our
shooters came in and knew that

The Wolverines ended up
shooting 8-for-18 from beyond

two more threes than Michigan,
it also took 36 attempts.
The Cyclones live and die by

to 30 attempts a game. The only
other time the Cyclones (6-2) lost
was against Penn State, when
they went 6-for-26 from the

very careful not to depend too
heavily on its shooting to win
games. Instead, defense has been
the focus so far.
"When go into a game we
don't think, 'We're shooters,

said. "We approach each game
differently, tryingto figure out

years, we go into games relying
on our defense so we can win
even when we aren't feeling our

Rebounding has been a central
focus of the Wolverines' defense,
primarilybecause it's been their
weakness. Iowa State snagged 10
more boards than Michigan, and
No.6 Maryland - the only team
to beat the Wolverines - nabbed
23 more rebounds.
"Free throws and defensive
rebounds win games," Borseth
said.

"I'm proud of our football team
and what we've been able to do,"
said Virginia Tech coach Frank
Beamer in a teleconference last
night. "I think the people we've
been able to beat, they didn't seem
weak to me.
"There's a lot of reasons why
you'd like to have Virginia Tech in
your bowlgame."
Beamer would know - the
25th-year coach is a Virginia Tech
graduate and wasthe starting cor-
nerback for the Hokies from 1967-
69. He's currently first in all-time
wins (251) and bowl appearances
(18) for active coaches.
During Beamer's tenure at Vir-
ginia Tech, the program has been
one of the most consistent in the
nation, winning 10 or more games
in eight straight seasons and in 13
of the past 16.
Though he's been around a long
time, Beamer knows very little
about the Wolverines. He said he's
never met Michigan coach Brady
Hoke buthas heard good things.
"I know (Hoke's) name for
the tremendous job he's done in
coaching," Beamer said. "I don't
know a lot about Michigan. Until
recently, I didn't really think us
and Michigan would be meeting
in a bowl game."
There was a similar feeling on
Michigan's end.
"From the clips on ESPN, they
look pretty good," said senior
defensive end Ryan Van Bergen.

"I know his name for the tre-

he got them all going in the same
direction at a fast pace. And the
wins that he had, the way they
played and the discipline that
they played with - from where
he came from he won and he
won quickly at Michigan.
"Michigan's got a great future
in front of it."
There's no place like a bowl

Everyone already knows

cH UCK BURTON/AP
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer and the Hokies have just two losses in 2011, but both came against Clemson.

"I didn't get the chance to watch
them too much this season, but
obviously we're taking them very
seriously. They're going to be very
motivated off their loss to Clem-
son and they've got plenty of ath-
letes, I know that."
Michigan has some athletes
of its own, too. And there's little
doubt that one of the first names
Beamer will address in prepara-
tion for Michigan will be Denard
Robinson. Beamer has never seen
the junior quarterback playin per-
son, but he's seen plenty of him on
television.
"What I've seen of him is on the
highlight reels, and he's got plen-
ty of them," Beamer said. "You
understand pretty quickly what a
unique and talented athlete he is."
The Hokies also have a pretty
talented dual-threat quarterback
about Denard Robinson. Even a
busy coach like Beamer found
time to catch highlights.
"That guy can go," he said.
But will Robinson thrive in
maybe his only opportunity to
be remembered outside of Ann
Arbor?
Everyone will learn about
Mike Martin and Ryan Van Ber-
gen and the Michigan-defense-
that-could - a group that played
fundamentally sound and smart
football and became a respect-
able unit instead of a bunch of
misfit individuals. Will anything
change against an athletic Vir-
ginia Tech team?
Fitzgerald Toussaint, who
made a season out of the past five
games, will face a newfound level
of pressure. Can he keep up his
pace?
Forget that Michigan doesn't
deserve the spotlight. By no
means are the Wolverines - who
finished ranked 13th in the final
BCS standings - absolutely a
better team than No. 6 Arkan-
sas or No. 7 Boise State or No. 9
Kansas State. We'll never know.
They'll never play those teams.
Michigan has its tradition and
program prestige to thank for
this chance to play No. 11 Virgin-
ia Tech (who also should thank
its rich history) in a clash of tra-

in redshirt sophomore Logan
Thomas. Thomas was a second-
team All-ACC selection this sea-
son, completing 60.5 percent of
his passes for 18 touchdowns and
seven interceptions. He also car-
ried the ball 125 times for an aver-
age of three yards per carry and 10
total touchdowns.
Robinson, a second-team All-
Big Ten selection, mirrors Thom-
as's touchdown numbers but has
thrown double the amount of
interceptions with 14. However,
Robinson is a much bigger threat
on the ground - he's averaged 5.9
yards per carry off 208 rushes for
16 touchdowns this season.
"From what I've seen, that guy
can go," Beamer said.
Beamer, who has coached sev-
eral dual-threat quarterbacks
in his career, including Michael
ditional powerhouses in a bowl
game with equally rich history.
Granted, it's not the Grand-
daddy of them all. No, Michigan
didn't accomplish all of Hoke's
goals: win the Big Ten, go to the
Rose Bowl.
But for the seniors who had
only one bowl appearance in
three seasons, the spotlight alone
is enough.
The lights weren't as bright at
the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville,
and even then, Rich Rodriguez's
shadow was large enough to
obscure a 38-point loss to Missis-
sippi State, an average SEC team.
"It was embarrassing to say
the least," Koger said. "I think it
was disappointing to just put all
that work into a football game
and have the outcome that we
did last year.
"The main thing is to go dowr
(to New Orleans) and win the
football game."
Once Hoke and the Wolver-
ines beat Ohio State, it became
more than a comeback. Hoke's
re-establishing Michigan for
what it once was one step at a
time. The next is beating the
Hokies in front of the nation.
Just 10 teams get to play in
BCS games and, politics and
fairness aside, Michigan's one
of them. That means something

Vick, said it'll help a little bit that
his team is used to playing with
running quarterbacks.
But when it comes down to it,
the Hokies are still going to have
to find a way to take down the
shifty Robinson.
"I think us having that type of
guys gives us some experience,"
he said. "But it all gets back to the
players and being able to tackle
the guy when you get him there."
For Virginia Tech, the Clemson
spanking is in the past. The bad
taste of its second loss is gone and
sugar is all it can taste.
And now, the Hokies' focus is
solely on Michigan.
"We're gonna pay close atten-
tion to (Michigan) now," Beamer
said. "We're going to get to work
on them and try to represent the
ACC in the best way possible."

GUPTILL
From Page 1B
Michigan, but Michigan (4-6-2-1,
8-8-2) needed to win in Fairbanks
if for no other reason thanto prove
that it could. And forget the three
flights the Wolverines had to take
to get it. Berenson would've taken
three more.
"You've got to win on the road,"
he said. "This is an important win
to take a lot of pressure off (the
team)."
With two minutes remaining
in regulation, though, the elusive
victory appeared in serious jeop-
ardy. Of all the bad spots to take
a penalty, freshman defenseman
Brennan Serville - coming off a
career-best two-point game on
Friday - picked the worst. Per-
haps out of desperation, Serville
was sent to the penalty box for
boarding. The Wolverines would
have to close it out a man down.
"I didn't see the hit," Berenson
said. "But it must've been a serious
hit or they wouldn't have called it
(so late in the game)."
What followed was likely the
strongest penalty kill of the sea-
son. It shifted the momentum to
Michigan for the overtime period,
of which Guptill needed just 57
seconds.
"Our team dug in and they
killed it," Berenson said of the late
penalty. "That was a huge kill -
one shot and the game's over."
Before the game, Berenson
told the Wolverines that it could
be another one-goal game, but
with fewer goals than Friday's 4-3
Alaska win. In the second period,

with the score still knotted atzero,
Michigan realized his prediction
may be spot on.
"(Nanook goaltender Scott)
Greenham's making huge save
after huge save," Hunwick said.
"Halfway through the game, it
looked like one goal could do it."
Knowing that changed noth-
ing for Hunwick. He rose to the
occasion, recording his seventh

career shutout and first away from
Yost Ice Arena. Hunwick shared
Berenson and Guptill's relief. But
he knows the win is simply a small
step in the right direction.
"Guys are excited," Hunwick
said. "We didn't want to go home
with zero points. (But) it's a rivalry
week. We'll turn our attention to
Michigan State."
When asked whether the get-
away game could serve as a turn-
ing point, Berenson wasn't ready
to make any more bold predic-
tions. But the sigh of relief said it
all. With the weight of the world
off the team's shoulders, the Wol-
verines may again be ready to play
"Michigan hockey," the mistake-
free style of play that the team
reverted to - at least temporarily
- Saturday.

Fifth-year senior Ryan Van Bergen said the Sugar Bowl was Michigan's chance to put a "stamp" on its 10-2 season.

for Hoke, the program and the
senior's legacy.
"It kind of establishes nation-

program," said fifth-year senior
defensive end Ryan Van Bergen.
"It puts us kind of back on the
map so to speak as a national
powerhouse.

"It's a tremendous opportu-
nity to put a final stamp on this
year."
When he was asked how big
a stage the Sugar Bowl would
be, interestingly enough, Koger
started talking about how differ-
ent it would be playing indoors
at the Louisiana Superdome.

"The lighting will be a little
bit different," he said. "It's going

Wolverines, Nanooks play
rare scoreless regulation

Redshirt sophomore forward Jordan Morgan scored 16 points in Michigan's 76-66 victory over Iowa State.
Morgan sports new look,
new game in 'M' victory

NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
When Jordan Morgan got rid
of his faded high-top haircut,
it was a textbook example of
addition by subtraction. At least
that's how Michigan coach John
Beilein saw it.
After shedding some locks,
the redshirt sophomore Morgan
was the center at the center of
the Wolverines' attack Satur-
day - knocking down jumpers,
slamming home dunks and get-
ting to the free-throw line in
Michigan's 76-66 win over Iowa
State.
"If you ask Beilein, he'll say
it's the haircut," Morgan said.
"But, I mean, it could be."
Morgan was 7-for-10 from
the field and 5-for-5 in the sec-
ond half, becoming the team's
second-leading scorer with 16
points.
"We do want to score close to
the basket," Beilein said. "You
look at our 2-point field goal
percentage, it was tremendous
today. So we're trying to get the
ball inside, hopefully with an
angle of some type. I like what
(Morgan) did today, he scored
without angles and that's really
important for him to do that."
After sophomore Jon Horford
started the firstgame of the sea-
son at center, Morgan has since
taken control of the spot he held
all last season. Though Morgan

has had impressive stretches,
he's been absent for periods at
a time too. On Saturday, he was
visible for all 23 of his minutes.
"You can't just be a perimeter
team," Beilein said. "You've got
to have some presence inside.
He's worked hard, he's going to
continue to work hard."
Though Morgan scored
Michigan's first two baskets of
the game, he tired, and Beilein
pulled him out of the game for
nine minutes.
A rejuvenated Morgan came
back in the second half and hurt
Iowa State from all areas in and
around the paint. He scored 12
of his 16 points in the second
period and was the key cog in
helping the Wolverines build
a 20-point lead before it was
whittled down to single digits
late in the game.
"I just feel like I got the ball
places where I could score and
my teammates were looking for
me," Morgan said. "It started
on defense. We got stops on
defense, we were able to get
easy baskets out on transition. It
was just easier to push that lead
up."
Morgan's early baskets were
layups, but as the game pro-
gressed, his range increased.
Teammates got into the lane
and found him to spark a 21-5
run toward the start of the sec-
ond half.
He made two jumpers from

FAIRBANKS - Some fans

Regardless, the 3,367 people at

Great Lakes Invitational.
And freshman forward Alex
Guptill made sure the end result
would be the same when he lit
the lamp just under one minute
into the extra period.
"It came at the end of shift
there," Guptill said. "It kind of
turned out lucky. We were get-
ting really down ... but now we
know what it feels like to win."
Though teammates and
coaches alike were quick to cred-
it fifth-year senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick for keeping the
Wolverines in the game, he was
even quicker to reciprocate the
gratitude.
"(The defense) did a huge
job," Hunwick said. "They were
clearing guys out so I could see
the shots from the point. We
did a good job tonight of limit-

the paint - one of which drew a
foul --as well as a 13-footer near
the elbow.
"He's been working on that
jumper - that little 15 (and)
10-footer - all through summer
and all through practice," said
sophomore forward Tim Hard-
away Jr. "So he showed it today
and he's knocking it down. That
just gives Coach Beilein more
confidence in him down the
stretch when we need to get a
shot in the post."
Added Beilein: "We work
so hard on these areas and we
came out during the beginning
of the season and didn't show
those areas. It's tough to win
without it, so I think that was a
good step for him."
For the season, Morgan is
27-for-35 from the field - an
unworldly 77 percent. His free
throws, on the other hand,
could use some work. Though
he made two of three on Satur-
day, he's at a disappointing 44
percent through eight games.
Both averages will likely gravi-
tate to the mean, but Michigan
can still expect Morgan to keep
his play at a high level.
"He was just knocking down
shots and that's what we need
from him," Hardaway Jr. said.
"He was playing smart and he
was playing hard and aggres-
sive. So that's what we need out
of Jordan Morgan all through
the season."

ing screens and tips and all that
stuff."
Added Guptill: "Shawn's our
go-to guy. He's been unbeliev-
able in the last two years here.
"If we're going to end up win-
ning, we're going to need to ride
him."
WIDER ICE WILL SUFFICE:
The weekend series against Alas-
ka Fairbanks marked the second
time this season that Michigan
had played on Olympic-sized
ice. The Wolverines also had to
adjust to the larger playing sur-
face against Northern Michigan
in October.
No learning curve has been
evident. In fact, some Michigan
players seem to think it favors
the team's playing style.
"The Olympic ice is a lot dif-
ferent," Guptill said. "We have a
really fast team and I think our
speed showed (Saturday). We

controlled the play."
For some teams, the extra
space to cover spreads players
too thin.
But that hardly seemed to be
an issue this weekend in Alaska.
Though the offense took a while
to get going in the series finale,
Michigan scored three times in
Friday's loss.
NOTES: With his seventh
shutout, Hunwick climbed into a
tie for fifth on Michigan's career
shutout list.
Saturday's meeting was the
53rd all-time between the Wol-
verines and the Nanooks. Michi-
gan holds the series lead with a
42-10-1 advantage. The Wolver-
ines' 18 first-period shots are the
second most the team has had
in a single period this season.
Against Bentley on Oct. 7, Michi-
gan managed to fire off 23 shots
in the third period.

A few feet away from Beren-
son, junior forward A.J. Treais
happily signed autographs for a
handful of Alaskan Wolverines
fans. Fifth-year senior goalie
Shawn Hunwick chatted before
taking questions.
Freshman forward Alex
Guptill, who scored the game-
winning goal in overtime on Sat-
urday, kept bringing up streaks.
But this time, he wasn't talking
about losing.
"We were getting really down
there," Guptill said. "We just
weren't sure we could win. It was
a really long streak, but it's over

Mostly, the players just looked
relieved.
"The team's really light now,"
Guptill said. "I think it took us
17 hours to get here, so I can
only imagine 17 long hours after
another sweep and eight (winless
games) in a row. That would've
been brutal."
A few Michigan personnel
patted each other on the back and
exchanged different versions of
the same message: Finally.
Finally, a bounce that went
the Wolverines' way. Guptill's
goal actually deflected off of a
Nanook defender and into the
net.
Finally, a happy locker room.
And finally, the defense
stepped up. After surrendering

20 goals in the previous four
games, the defense earned the
victory to snap the streak.
"It's huge for the defense,"
Hunwick said. "We weren't
turning the puck over. In recent
weeks we've been turning it over
a little bittoo much."
Hunwick credited his defense
with clearing out the middle of
the ice so Hunwick could have
a better view of shots from the
point. Alaska generates much of
its offense from shots from the
blue line.
Clearing the center of the ice
also limited deflection opportu-
nities and chances to score on
rebounds.
Rebound goals plagued the
Wolverines the entire winless
streak.

The penalty-kill unit smoth-
ered the Alaska power play,
stopping all eight of their oppor-
tunities on the weekend.
The defense let just four shots
through on four power-play
opportunities on Saturday and
kept the Nanooks out both dur-
ing and after the man advantage.
The Wolverines rode Hun-0
wick to the win.
Hunwick came up with huge
saves late in the game, especially
during a two-minute Nanook
power play at the end of regula-
tion.
"(Hunwick is) like our team,"
Berenson said. "We had a lot of
pressure on us and a little bit of
self doubt and so on. Sooner or
later we were going to get out of
it, but the sooner part is better."
