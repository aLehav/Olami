If all had gone to plan on 

Thursday 
morning, 
student 

employees of the University 
Unions would be sitting in the 
Board of Regents meeting room 
in protest of white nationalist 
Richard Spencer’s potentially 
speaking on campus. After 
a 
meeting 
with 
Unions 

administrators 
earlier 
this 

week, the employees shifted 
their efforts to public spaces to 
avoid risk of termination.

As the board convenes two 

weeks after the University 
agreed to negotiate Spencer’s 
presence, 
and 
as 
students 

across campus continue to 

protest threats to their safety, 
questions still swirl around the 
roles of — and accommodations 
for — student workers who 
might be asked to facilitate his 
appearance.

LSA senior Zoe Proegler, 

Michigan 
League 
building 

manager, 
was 
central 
to 

the planning of the original 
nightlong sit-in. She believes 
any event featuring Spencer 
and his racist, often violent 
rhetoric cannot be held safely 
on campus. Protesters goaded 
by Spencer at rallies this 
year have left injuries and, in 
Charlottesville, Va., death, in 
their wake. 

Proegler 
said 
student 

workers 
setting 
up 
and 

The University of Michigan 

College of Engineering and 
Qualcomm 
Incorporated 

have partnered to form the 
Qualcomm Thinkabit Lab, an 
interactive workshop for high 
school students to learn about 
STEM careers and experience a 
hands-on learning experience. 
Thinkabit officially opened 
its doors last Thursday in the 
Detroit area.

While dialogue between the 

Qualcomm and the College of 
Engineering has existed in the 
past regarding other projects, 
the Thinkabit Lab has been 
the first to materialize.

The Michigan Engineering 

Zone was elected as a now-
shared 
location 
for 
the 

Thinkabit Lab, continuing its 
work as the rendezvous for 
various Detroit high schools’ 
FIRST Robotics teams, which 
take place after the regular 
school day. Zone Director 
Julian 
Pate 
believes 
the 

integration of the Thinkabit 
Lab in the Zone will inspire 
potential programs for high 
school students.

“The Michigan Engineering 

Zone was opened nine years 
ago; the objective was to 
offer 
year-round 
activities 

to engage the students in the 
city of Detroit,” Pate said. 
“That has been accomplished 
partly with the nine years of 
the high school program. The 

Thinkabit Lab provides the 
opportunity to do that down 
the grade ladder, across the 
entire school year.”

Engineering 
graduate 

student Wayne Lester has 
been involved with the MEZ 
since he was a student at 
Cass Tech High School in 
Detroit. He now works with 
the organization as a FIRST 
Robotics mentor, and echoes 
Pate’s enthusiasm about the 

partnership with Thinkabit. 

“I’ve seen a lot of students 

come in and out learning a lot 
about STEM fields and just 
getting a good opportunity to 
be exposed to the field,” Lester 
said. “With the Thinkabit Lab, 
it definitely just expands on the 
mission of the MEZ. It’s really 
to be a collaborative space 
and really engage students 
in STEM fields, and with the 
Thinkabit Lab it’s the perfect 

opportunity for… giving more 
students the opportunity to 
navigate the STEM field and 
really be educated on what it 
is.” 

The 
Thinkabit 
Lab 

functions much like a school 
field 
trip 
for 
the 
middle 

school students. It is split 
into two halves: the first of 
which focuses on engaging 
students, 
with 
experiences 

When 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
started 
teaching 

Chinese and Japanese in the 
summer of 1936, the Asian 
Languages 
and 
Cultures 

Department didn’t exist.

As World War II approached, 

these classes became much 
more 
pertinent, 
and 
the 

Department of Far Eastern 
Languages 
and 
Literatures 

was created. The program 
grew rapidly, and in 1985, it 
was renamed the Department 
of 
Asian 
Languages 
and 

Cultures. Now, the department 
offers 11 languages that qualify 
for an Asian languages and 
cultures minor, and two more 
— Bengali and Punjabi — that 
students can take for a two-
year sequence. 

The department continues 

to grow and attract student 
attention, 
and 
the 
Asian 

languages and cultures minor 
is currently ranked as the 
seventh-most-declared minor 
in LSA. But though over 100 
students graduate with the 
minor each year, some of them,

Some universities remain in legal battles with him, while others mitigate the aftermath

The “college tour” of Neo-Nazi 

and white supremacist Richard 
Spencer will possibly include a 

stop at the University of Michigan, 
eliciting outraged reactions from 
students, faculty and staff from 
both sides of the political sphere.

Conservative 
speakers 

have 
regularly 
been 
using 

college campuses this year as 
platforms 
through 
which 
to 

put forth their agendas. From 
Milo Yiannopoulos in Berkeley, 

Calif., to Charles Murray at the 
University earlier this semester, 
students and administration have 
been in conflict over whether 
these controversial figures should 
be allowed to speak on campus. 
With Spencer, who is banned 
from several European countries, 
there is the fear of violence to 
follow him.

This article is part three of 

a series in which The Daily 
looks at universities similar to 
the University of Michigan on 
the issue of reacting in a tense 
campus climate. As the university 
administration 
and 
students 

face their own numerous bias 
incidents, The Daily will look

Earlier this week, Ann Arbor 

City Council introduced its 
2018 deer management plan 
to the public. The city aims 
to eliminate up to 250 deer 
from Jan. 8 to Jan. 31 in the 
third year of its four-year deer 
management program. This is 
a large increase from winter 
2017, when the city aimed to 
eliminate up to 100 deer.

Furthermore, the plan states 

that up to 26 deer will be 
nonlethally sterilized between 
Jan. 2 and 7. Last year they 
planned to sterilize up to 60 
deer and sterilized 54.

The program began out of 

resident complaints about deer 
harming their properties.

Like last year, the lethal 

portion of the plan will be 
carried out by sharpshooters 
through the city’s contractor, 
White Buffalo Inc. It will 
comply with the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Natural 

Resources 
research 
permit. 

During the elimination, select 
public 
parks 
and 
private 

properties will be closed from

In New York, the most 

popular Uber destination in 
2017 
was 
the 
Metropolitan 

Museum of Art, and in Illinois, 
Wrigley Field reigned supreme, 
according to a list released by 
Uber.

However, 
Michigan’s 

most 
Uber-ed-to 
destination 

is an ode to a campus staple: 
Scorekeepers, most commonly 
referred to as “Skeeps.”

LSA sophomore Annelise 

Droste said she has had only 
positive experiences with Ubers 
to and from Skeeps, making 
her unsurprised at Michigan’s 
results.

“I guess I’m not really 

surprised; Skeeps is kind of far 
from some student housing, 
whether 
South 
Campus 
or 

South U, where most students 
live,” Droste said. “I Ubered 
there last year from North 

Campus a few times because 
it’s a 20-minute walk from the 
bus. If it’s cold there’s no way I 
walk.”

The 
list 
was 
released 

Tuesday, 
ranking 
the 
top 

destination 
of 
each 
state, 

excluding airports and transit 
stations. The list is largely 
composed of malls, ballparks, 
performance venues and bars.

Additionally, Uber said the 

busiest period for Uber drivers 
was Saturday night at 11 p.m., 
and most Ubers were taken 
Oct. 28, the Saturday before 
Halloween.

New Jersey was shown to be 

the earliest-rising state, while 
Mississippi stays out the latest.

3 p.m. to midnight Jan. 8 
through Jan. 31. The Nichols 
Arboretum 
is 
expected 
to 

be closed on Jan 9, 16, 19 and 
23; however, it must first be 
approved by the University of 
Michigan.

Additionally, 
other 

University 
and 
Concordia 

University 
properties 
will 

potentially be shut down Jan. 
8 through Jan. 31, pending 
authorization. 
In 
previous 

years, 
the 
University 
has 

agreed to allow the cull to take 
place on University property.

According 
to 
the 

implementation plan released 
by the city, the sharpshooting 
may only occur from a parked 
vehicle, and shooting on the 
city-selected private property 
will not occur without the 
owner’s consent.

The city will post signs 

regarding the closure in parks 

and nature areas that will 
be affected by the program 
at least 24 hours before the 
three-week 
process 
begins. 

Residents living adjacent to 
any of these areas will be 
notified via postcard by the 
end of the month. They will 
also use social media and 
other new outlets to inform 
residents of the sterilization 
program.

This is the second year the 

plan includes the sterilization 
of 
deer, 
which 
will 
also 

carried out by White Buffalo. 
The process involves darting 
the female deer, temporarily 
removing them from the area, 
surgically 
sterilizing 
them 

and returning them to the 
park. The process will take 
approximately an hour per 
deer, and is not expected to 
disturb residents.

The city is in need for 

volunteers 
to 
aid 
in 
the 

sterilization, an effort that 
will save many deer. The 
volunteers assist in tasks such 
as monitoring vitals during 

the surgery and returning the 
deer to their original location. 
There will be two shifts of 
volunteers 
throughout 
the 

nights, and they will work six 
to seven hours per shift, with 
the first beginning at 4 p.m. 
and the second ending at 5 a.m., 
from Jan. 2 to Jan 5 or 6. Each 
volunteer will be required to 
work at least two shifts, and 
food will be provided.

Christopher Dick, ecology 

and 
evolutionary 
biology 

professor, 
discussed 
the 

importance of the cull at a 
recent 
community 
council 

meeting.

“If we are able to reduce Ann 

Arbor’s urban deer population 
to a more sustainable level 
— by sustainable, I mean a 
deer abundance that permits 
natural forest regeneration — 
this will have an immediate 
positive impact on our natural 
areas,” Dick said. “The herd 
reduction will help to stave 
the spread of ticks that carry 
diseases such as Lyme disease. 
Black-legged ticks and Lyme 

disease 
have 
recently 

been 
documented 
in 

Washtenaw County.”

Despite the city saying 

the deer cull is necessary, 
the implementation of 
this program has been 
a controversial topic in 
the community for many 
years.

Among those against 

the cull is LSA senior 
Aaron Brodkey, president 
of the Michigan Animal 
Respect Society. He told 
The Daily earlier this 
year that he felt it was 
wrong for humans to 
intervene in nature. 

“Personally, 
I 
just 

think it’s maybe wrong 
or rash to make this 
decision,” Brodkey said 
in January. “I feel like 
we’re taking it into our 
own hands and playing 
God in this position and 
saying, ‘Hey, we need 
to massacre 100 deer 
for 
who 
knows 
what 

reason?’”

Thursday, December 7, 2017 — 3A

including Public Policy junior 
Gabby McFarland, are upset 
about the name of their degree 
from the department. 

“I 
originally 
decided 
to 

minor 
in 
Chinese 
because 

of the benefits of speaking a 
second 
language. 
However, 

once 
I 
studied 
abroad 
in 

China I grew interested in 
the cultural aspects of the 
minor,” McFarland wrote in an 
email. “I feel like there being 
no 
specific 
Chinese 
major 

or 
minor 
is 
fundamentally 

ignorant. Having an Asian 
Language Department fails to 
recognize individual countries 
and 
cultures, 
and 
instead 

groups them.” 

As McFarland said, there 

is no Chinese major or minor. 
Students also can’t get a degree 
in Japanese, Thai, Sanskrit 
or Urdu. But by taking any of 
those languages — or any of 
seven others — for three years, 
plus a few other classes, and a 
student could declare an Asian 
languages and cultures minor. 

According to Ashlee Wolfe, 

curriculum 
and 
student 

services 
manager 
for 
the 

department, this blanket major 
is mostly an administrative 

necessity. Within Wolverine 
Access, majors allow for a 
second, 
specific 
program 

sub-plan to be named. For 
example, Asian studies majors 
can declare a sub-major with a 
further specified area of study, 
and that sub-major will show 
up on their transcript. But this 
same technological capability 
doesn’t exist for minors.

“That 
really 
has 
to 
do 

with 
administrative 
and 

technological capabilities. … 
But they’re still minoring in 
Chinese, they’re still minoring 
in Hindi; it’s just that their 
transcript can’t really reflect 
that,” Wolfe said. “The only 
way it could reflect that is if 
we actually created (eleven) 
separate 
minors 
for 
the 

program and that’s excessive.” 

The Slavic Languages and 

Literatures 
Department, 
on 

the other hand, does offer 
specific minors for different 
languages (although one of its 
minors is a combined minor in 
Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian 
languages). 
Prof. 
Michael 

Makin, department director 
of 
undergraduate 
studies, 

explained this separation as a 
way for students to focus in on 
a certain area of Slavic culture. 

“When we have had enough 

teaching 
resources 
and 

courses, we have created a 
minor in each of those other 

language areas, and, indeed, 
it is my own impression that 
students want to take minors 
that 
specifically 
identify 

distinct areas of Slavic culture 
— after all, Czech language and 
culture are radically different 
from, say, Russian, or the South 
Slavic 
area,” 
Makin 
wrote 

in an email. “I would have 
nothing against the creation of 
a minor in ‘Slavic Languages 
and Cultures,’ but, to my mind, 
such a minor would denote 
general coverage of the area.” 

Wolfe said her department 

understands this desire to hone 
in on a certain topic, and the 
minor is set up in a way that 
student can do that. However, 
separate minors are not a 
reality for the department.

“It’s 
a 
little 
bit 
more 

realistic for all other units,” 
she said. “For us, it’s more 
just administratively silly and 
redundant to actually create 
separate 
minors 
for 
every 

single one of our languages 
that qualify for a minor. … 
Minors don’t really get a line 
on a student’s resume. Majors 
get a line on a student’s resume. 
So when it comes to minors it’s 
more about the skills students 
get from these minors … and 
they have the transcript to 
back these up.” 

According to Wolfe, students 

usually don’t have a problem 

with the generality of the 
minor’s name once she explains 
to them how the degree works 
and what employers care about. 
Nonetheless, McFarland still 
didn’t feel satisfied after she 
received a similar story.

“When I declared my minor, 

our conversation was focused 
around my Chinese curriculum 
so it didn’t really occur to 
me that it would eventually 
say 
Asian 
Languages 
on 

my 
transcript,” 
McFarland 

wrote. “I think having an 
Asian 
Languages 
minor 

could negatively impact my 
resume because there could be 
expectations that I might not 
fulfill having only concentrated 
in 
Chinese. 
Additionally, 
I 

chose the Chinese program to 
develop language skills, which 
I would like to explicitly list on 
my resume. An Asian Language 
minor inhibits this.”

Yet, Wolfe said students 

should recognize what they are 
really getting with an Asian 
languages and cultures minor. 

“It’s more about highlighting 

the skill-set you gained from 
a 
minor,” 
she 
said. 
“And 

(students) can easily say that 
they have, for instance, a 
Korean minor, because truly 
they do. The fact that it’s named 
Asian languages and cultures 
is truly just an administrative, 
bureaucratic thing.”

President 
Mark 

Schlissel announced Nov. 21 the 
University planned to proceed 
with Spencer’s request to speak 
on campus, on the condition it 
could ensure him a safe setting. 
The decision was confirmed at 
an emergency meeting for the 
University’s Board of Regents.

Schlissel’s reasons for the 

decision 
were 
trifold. 
He 

explained the University cannot 
restrict the content of speech, 
based on the First Amendment; 
denying Spencer would result 
in more public attention given 
to Spencer; and free speech 
is fundamental to democratic 
society 
— 
an 
attribute 
the 

University must protect. 

Kyle Bristow — an attorney 

for Cameron Padgett, a Georgia 
State 
University 
student 

submitting requests for Spencer 
to speak on multiple campuses 
— tweeted Oct. 27: “This evening 
@CameronVPadgett 
requested 

to rent a room at @UMichfor 
@RichardBSpencer 
to 
speak. 

Your move, @DrMarkSchlissel.” 
Rick Fitzgerald, assistant vice 
president 
for 
public 
affairs, 

confirmed Oct. 31 the University 
was made aware of Spencer’s 
request to speak.

Stop Spencer at the University 

of Michigan — a coalition that 
formed 
in 
response 
to 
the 

request — posted on Facebook 
in 
early 
November, 
saying 

though it knows Schlissel and 
many administrators do not 
want Spencer to come, “they 
have failed to acknowledge the 
severity of the situation and 
have yet to say no to Spencer.” 
The group used the hashtag 
#HailNotHeil.

Nov. 17, they posted a link to 

an article from the Detroit Free 
Press, explaining Bristow would 
give the University until Nov. 24 
to decide if Spencer could speak, 
or face a lawsuit.

The 
night 
of 
Schlissel’s 

announcement, the group called 
on the University community 
to protest the decision. Nov. 25, 
it called for a week of action, 
using the hashtag #StopSpencer. 
Subsequently, during the week 
of Nov. 27, student protesters 
participated 
in 
speak-outs, 

teach-ins and strikes, calling 
on the administration to deny 
Spencer.

The University has yet to 

decide on a safe setting and time 
for Spencer to speak on campus. 
Although the threat of lawsuit 
has been delayed until Friday, it 
is uncertain if it will allow such. 

In an email to The Daily, 

LSA senior Hoai An Pham, the 
press coordinator for the Stop 
Spencer at the University of 
Michigan coalition, wrote the 
administration has not made 
any effort to ensure the safety of 
students. 

“During 
our 
week 
of 

action, which called for the 
administration to take action, 
they only issued a statement 
that they did not support the 
protests (only the teach ins), 
again without offering anything 
productive,” she wrote. “There 
has been no action taken by 
the administration to support 
students.”

Furthermore, 
Pham 

emphasized 
she 
believes 

the statements made by the 
administration 
have 
been 

lackluster. 

“While 
the 
administration 

thinks that simply saying that 
it does not stand for Spencer’s 
ideologies is enough, that is 
an 
inactive 
and 
bystander 

response,” she wrote. “It is easy 
to say that you do not agree 
with Spencer. It is harder to 
admit that in allowing him 
on campus, you are placing 
marginalized students in an 
incredibly dangerous situation. 
A 
statement 
against 
white 

supremacy does not stop a bullet 
from being shot into a crowd, as 
has happened with Spencer and 
his supporters.”

“Spencer has already scored 

a victory”

History 
lecturer 
Anne 

Berg, who spoke at one of the 
#StopSpencer teach-ins, wrote 
in an email to The Daily she was 
not sure why the University is 
taking its current position.

“I suspect it is much for 

the same reason that Florida 
allowed Spencer to appear on 
campus – both Florida and our 
own institution have essentially 
bowed their head and accepted 

the terms of the debate set by 
Spencer and his team, they have 
been complicit with Spencer’s 
insistence that this is an issue 
of free speech rather than one 
of violent threats and dangers to 
student safety,” she wrote. “In 
that respect Spencer has already 
scored a victory.”

To 
Berg, 
the 
debate 

surrounding 
Spencer’s 

appearances 
are 
incorrectly 

attributed to free speech, rather 
than the violence rhetoric within 
Spencer’s “ideas.” She said his 
denial of people and their right 
to exist was very much a threat.

“Spencer’s platform denies the 

right to exist for Black people and 
people of color more generally. 
Accordingly, the mere presence 
of people of color seems to be 
taken as a provocation by many 
of Spencer’s supporters and 
accordingly they feel entitled 
and emboldened to follow up on 
Spencer’s “ideas” with their fists, 
cars and guns,” she explained.

Schlissel, in a school-wide 

email, emphasized his disgust 
for Spencer and his beliefs. 
This has been reflected in other 
schools as well.

In December 2016, Spencer 

spoke at Texas A&M University. 
According to an article from 
The Battalion — the university’s 
student newspaper — Spencer 
was greeted with applause and 
boos. He was asked to speak on 
campus by Preston Wiginton, a 
former student, amid negative 
reactions 
from 
the 
campus 

community. 
The 
university’s 

president, 
in 
fact, 
endorsed 

several guest speakers who came 

to campus to “counter” Spencer.

At a protest during the event, 

Texas A&M University student 
Aaron Blasband, the student 
president of Texas A&M Hillel, 
said he opposed neo-Nazism.

“I’m 
here 
because 
I 
am 

against white supremacy,” he 
said. “I am against neo-Nazism 
as a Jew. My grandparents 
were in the Holocaust and a 
large majority of my family was 
killed in the Holocaust from 
very similar thinking to this. So 
when something is going on like 
this it makes me want to go out 
there and spread love more than 
anything else.”

Alt-right 
organizers 
then 

scheduled 
a 
“white 
lives 

matter” event to take place on 
Sept. 11, 2017 at the university; 
Spencer was supposed to speak 
at the event. However, in a 
press release, the university 
administration 
canceled 
the 

event due to safety concerns.

Aug. 16, Janine Sikes, assistant 

vice president of public affairs at 
the University of Florida, said in 
a statement the university would 
deny Spencer his request to rent 
space, following concerns for 
campus safety. However, once 
it was faced with a lawsuit, the 
university relented and allowed 
Spencer to speak on campus in 
October.

U-F President Kent Fuchs 

said in a video announcement 
the university’s values do not 
align with those of Spencer. 
He encouraged students to not 
attend the October event.

“The values of our universities 

are not shared by Mr. Spencer, 

the National Policy Institute 
or his followers,” he said. “Our 
campuses 
are 
places 
where 

people from all races, origins 
and religions are welcomed and 
are treated with love. … I urge 
you to do two things. First, do 
not provide Mr. Spencer and 
his followers the spotlight they 
are seeking. I urge everyone to 
stay away from Phillips Center 
October 19. Second, although I 
urge you to avoid the Spencer 
event, I ask that you do not let 
Mr. Spencer’s message of hate 
and racism go unchallenged. 
Make it clear that messages of 
hate on our campus are contrary 
to our values.”

In an article from the Florida 

Alligator — the University of 
Florida’s 
student 
publication 

— Oggi Parry, a senior at the 
university, 
protested 
Spencer 

at the October event. He said 
he voted for President Donald 
Trump in the 2016 election, 
but he wanted to show Trump 
supporters do not align with 
Spencer. He wrapped his body in 
an American flag and wore red, 
white and blue sunglasses.

“Conservative views are not 

(Spencer’s) views,” he said. “We 
are not with him.”

Back in Michigan, University 

Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 
(D) 

said to deny Spencer would 
be an immoral act of the First 
Amendment. Schlissel echoed 
similar upholding values of the 
First Amendment in his school-
wide email.

that teach them about STEM 
fields, as well as others. This 
part is led by Lab coordinator 
LaShawn Sims, who explained 
the importance of introducing 
youth to career fields and the 
emphasis of personal assets.

“They do an activity that is 

called the Strengths, Interests 
and Values, where they look at 
their own individual strengths, 
interests and values,” Sims 
said. “They are able to look at 
about 45 different careers and 
determine what would be a 
good fit for them based on their 
own characteristics.”

The second half of the 

program 
follows 
with 
the 

conceptualization of an idea or 

invention by the students, and 
then its subsequent creation. 
Lab coordinator Haley Hart 
facilitate 
this 
part 
of 
the 

program, 
which 
highlights 

the engineering and hands-on 
aspect of the program.

The lab hosts about 30 

students 
per 
day 
and 
is 

predicted to host approximately 
3,000 students in one year.

While the original Thinkabit 

model has been functioning 
at 
Qualcomm’s 
San 
Diego 

headquarters for four years, the 
Detroit Thinkabit Lab began 
its soft launch in September 
and has been perfecting the 
program for the past two 
months.

The Detroit lab is the second 

Thinkabit location, excluding 
the headquarters in San Diego. 
Virginia Tech partnered with 
Qualcomm in fall 2016, opening 
a workshop at its Northern 
Virginia Center.

Plans for the MEZ and the 

Thinkabit lab include possibly 
expanding available programs 
to the summer. 

“Really, the progress or the 

outcome that we’re looking is 
for kids to have opportunities 
to learn about STEM careers, 
and get involved in hands on 
activities that would get them 
interested 
in 
learning 
and 

following down that pathway,” 
Hart said.

managing the event would be 
uniquely vulnerable. One of her 
supervisors, she said, alerted 
her 
that 
Spencer’s 
requests 

specified the Unions, some of 
the few buildings on campus 
available for public rent.

“Students 
are 
central 
to 

any event held in University 
Unions,” Proegler said. “We’re 
responsible for A/V — including 
the 
microphone 
he 
might 

speak in — tables and chairs, 
troubleshooting 
… 
student 

workers cannot be removed 
from the equation.”

Multiple 
employees 
said 

building directors did not broach 
workers’ concerns until talk of 
protest reached administrators 
this week. LSA junior Tim 
Williams, 
Michigan 
Union 

building manager, met with the 
Union building director Amy 
White on Monday about the 
sit-in. White told Williams the 
protest as planned would violate 
multiple building policies — the 
same ones employees are paid 
to enforce — including building 
hours and misuse of room keys. 
Student employees participating 
in the sit-in, she said, would do 
so at risk of losing their jobs or 
being replaced by other workers.

“I thought that was fair. 

Violating building policy comes 
with consequences,” Williams 
said. “Amy suggested we sit in 
the hallway during business 
hours instead. People could be 
fired as a result of that specific 
protest.” 

Unions senior director Susan 

Pile wrote in an email statement 
administrators 
would 
not 

encroach on workers’ freedom 
outside their jobs. 

“Student 
employees 
are 

an 
important 
part 
of 
our 

organization and would not 
lose their jobs for engaging in 
protest activity outside of their 
work responsibilities. We seek 
to provide a work environment 
that is supportive and flexible 
for student employees in all 
kinds of ways,” she wrote.

Still, both students agreed, 

administrators failed to take 
initiative on quelling employees’ 
fears. Williams said his meeting 
on the protest finally signaled to 
administrators that “we haven’t 
really talked to our employees 
and maybe we should.” He 
called these efforts, however, “a 
little late.” 

Proegler said scheduling a 

meeting with Xavier Wilson, her 
building director at the League, 
was like “pulling teeth.”

“He was dismissive of student 

worker concerns,” she said. “The 
assumption was that if (Spencer) 

comes, of course it’s going to 
be safe. Our greatest fear is 
that they are going to suddenly 
thrust the event on us in a way 
that disempowers us.”

At 
past 
Unions 
events 

featuring controversial speakers 
like Milo Yiannopoulos two 
years ago and Charles Murray 
earlier this semester, student 
workers still set up the rooms 
and were in close contact with 
the 
event, 
though 
Proegler 

said administrators made up 
most of the staff for the event 
itself. Part of the uncertainty 
around employees and Spencer 
stems from the vague nature 
of the event status — the event 
might not even take place in 
the Unions, as the buildings are 
difficult to secure. 

“It is too early to say how 

we might staff an event, if 
one even occurs,” University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
wrote in an email statement. 

Uncertainty 
around 
the 

circumstances 
of 
Spencer’s 

appearance is at the core of 
most students’ grievances with 
the negotiation process. In an 
interview with The Daily last 
week, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel was reluctant to 
detail who would be involved 
in deliberations around what 
safety meant.

“I don’t want to discuss the 

details — it will be people that 

are trusted to understand the 
legal issues that are involved 
and the public safety issues 
involved,” he said.

League 
building 
manager 

Natalie Ramos, a Social Work 
student, said her workers at the 
League — half of whom she said 
were students of color — have a 
stake in the definition of safety.

“As a Latina woman of color, I 

want the right to determine my 
own safety. And as a supervisor, 
I don’t want to obligate other 
students of color to come to (an 
event with Spencer) and direct 
them,” she said.

“I would feel an immense 

amount of guilty and mental 
burden to take all this effort, but 
to no avail,” Ramos continued. 
“We don’t think people are 
listening.”

Given Pile’s stated flexibility, 

all 
three 
employees 
agreed 

students likely would not be 
penalized for not working the 
event. Williams noted, though, 
event duties can only be shirked 
so far.

“Students would likely be 

asked to be there, but maybe 
we would be exempted,” he 
said. “But even then, temporary 
workers, who are often more 
disenfranchised and vulnerable, 
cannot call in sick. You can’t 
get robots to staff the event. 
Someone’s going to have to do 
it.”

I

magine 
you 
are, 
in 

the 
words 
of 
forensic 

psychiatrist Park Dietz, 

one of the “small number of 
people 
sitting 
at 

home, with guns on 
their lap and a hit 
list in their mind.” 
You turn on the news 
and hear countless 
details of the latest 
mass shooter’s life 
— 
describing 
him 

as a quiet guy, a 
loser, someone who 
just always avoided 
others. This strikes 
a chord. Dietz says, 
“It only takes one or two of 
them to say — ‘that guy is just 
like me, that’s the solution to 
my problem, that’s what I’ll 
do tomorrow.’” 

You are flush with envy, 

excitement and purpose. You 
run out your front door the 
next day with that infamous 
smirk we’ve all seen on TV. 
Tomorrow, you tell yourself, 
you’ll be on millions of people’s 
screens, but even better, on 
the minds of millions who will 
learn everything about you. 

The two dominant camps 

on the mass shooting debate 
— those who chalk it up to 
mental health or those who 
chalk it up to the availability 
of guns — fail to recognize this 
issue of fame that captivates 
so 
many 
mass 
shooters. 

This is convenient from a 
political perspective: It gives 
Democrats and Republicans a 
clear boogeyman to draw on 
whenever they are asked to 
comment on the latest mass 
shooting. Yet these stances fail 
to consider a novel solution to 
surge of shootings: ending the 
reporting of a mass shooter’s 
name, face and identity.

The idea behind such a ban 

is simple: Mass shooters crave 
a spotlight, and denying their 
recognition 
would 
greatly 

reduce the number of random 
killings in the country. A 
growing number of researchers 
have dived into the psyche 
of copycat killers, those who 
commit an attack similar to 
ones just before, and concluded 
the presence of sensational 
coverage of violent murders 
leads to more of the same.

Take the 1999 Columbine 

shooting, for example, where a 
report by Mother Jones found 
14 separate cases of suspects 
plotting to launch attacks on 
the anniversary of Columbine. 
The report discovered that 
in at least 10 of these cases 
the suspects referred to the 
Columbine 
shooters, 
Eric 

Harris and Dylan Klebold, 
as idols, martyrs or gods. 
The 
idolization 
indicates 

a growing obsession of the 
violently disturbed to seek 
out inspiration from others 
rather than coming to their 

violent conclusions 
on their own.

The problem with 

the 
mass 
media’s 

coverage of these 
attacks is everyone 
except the victims 
wins. 
Viewers 

get 
entertained, 

the 
media 
enjoys 

massive viewership 
spikes and the killer 
gets his 10 seconds 
of fame.

“Entertained” 
may 
not 

seem like the best word, but 
that’s exactly how the media 
presents its content and how 
viewers consume it. Interviews 
with 
the 
shooter’s 
family, 

body 
count 
graphics 
and 

“investigative” reporting on 
the killer’s lifelong history are 
all unnecessary bits of fluff 
designed to suck all the juice 
possible out of a story to retain 
views and shares.

Stopping this sensationalized 

coverage doesn’t mean the 
media would have to cease 
its duty to inform the public. 
Dietz recommends the media 
“localize (these stories) to the 
affected community and make 
it as boring as possible to every 
other market.” Though it may 
seem painful to “normalize” 
these 
shootings, 
it 
doesn’t 

mean we have to stop fighting 
for other solutions, such as 
comprehensive gun control or 
investments in mental health.

So far, the advice from 

many advocates of changing 
media 
coverage 
is 
to 

encourage the news and their 
consumers to stop producing or 
consuming this content. This is 
hardly sufficient.

The 
media 
faces 

overwhelming 
incentives 
to 

keep producing this coverage 
if their competitors do so — 
and why wouldn’t they? They 
are for-profit businesses with 
no legal or moral obligation 
outside 
of 
filling 
their 

directors’ 
pockets. 
On 
the 

other side of the equation, we 
as consumers indirectly feel 
a sense of moral obligation 
to continue watching and are 

largely unwilling to constantly 
share political attacks on the 
mainstream media’s content.

A much more drastic and 

sweeping measure would be 
to lobby Congress to introduce 
a 
bill 
altering 
the 
First 

Amendment of the Constitution 
to include a measure limiting 
for-profit media companies’ 
coverage 
of 
these 
attacks. 

Passing something as sweeping 
as a constitutional amendment 
sounds like a political pipe 
dream in our era of gridlock, 
but it is actually an example of 
a rare solution that transcends 
party lines.

Constitutional amendments 

themselves may seem like a 
relic; there hasn’t been a ratified 
proposal in over 20 years. 
This doesn’t mean, however, 
that calling for a proposal is 
by any means a crazy idea. 
There is still an active effort 
among many in Congress to 
keep it relevant — over 70 
amendments were proposed 
last year alone, and 11,699 
measures have been proposed 
over our nation’s history.

The 
revision 
would 
be 

irrelevant to the gun lobby 
— meaning it would untie 
the 
handcuffs 
Republican 

politicians have to the lobby 
and give them an opportunity 
to take action on an emotional 
issue. It also frees Democrats 
from 
the 
illogical, 
but 

widely held, concern among 
conservative voters that they 
are taking advantage of mass 
shootings 
to 
destroy 
the 

Second Amendment.

With sufficient grassroots 

organizing, states would be 
put under a pressure that 
transcends party lines and 
has significant backing from 
researchers. 
Conservatives 

may be wary of limiting free 
speech, but they are also the 
most likely group to deem the 
news “fake” and would likely 
welcome a process that limits 
its power for distortion.

This ban, if passed, would 

still fail to address the issue 
of underground reporting that 
would certainly pop up on 
online blogs and forums, but 
it would deny the true fame 
that many of these killers 
are after. They seek national 
recognition and revel in the 
kind of mass fear that only 
nationally 
syndicated 
news 

channels can provide as they 
stream in public places like 
airports or bars. Denying them 
this main avenue for infamy 
is a solution all sides of our 
fractured political spectrum 
should entertain.

M

ost people grow up 
watching 
football 

or basketball, but I 

grew up on comic books. My 
dad spent most of his time 
reading comic books, and I 
grew up learning about the 
characters in them.

When I was little, my dad 

read comics at the kitchen 
table and constantly warned 
me not to touch them. He 
still reads them today; there’s 
always at least one in the 
kitchen or living room, and 
he’s always sure to bring one 
on car rides. In elementary 
school, my family would sit 
down together to watch the 
newest 
superhero 
cartoon 

movie or TV show. Some of 
my favorite shows were “The 
Batman,” “Justice League” and 
“Justice League Unlimited.”

Shows and movies like this 

formed my childhood but 
unfortunately only included 
a few female superheroes. So, 
when I did get to see a woman 
fighting bad guys and saving 
the world in the movie, I held 
onto that image. As much as I 
liked Batman and as much as I 
saw him in movies and shows, 
Wonder Woman was always 
the superhero I looked up to 
most. Any cartoon featuring 
her was my go-to whenever 
my family tried to make a 
decision on a movie night. 
Movies in which she was the 
main character, like 2009’s 
cartoon 
movie 
“Wonder 

Woman,” were played over 
and over again at my house.

She stood out; whenever 

you saw her, she was in a space 
dominated by men. The idea 
of “hero” seems to link itself 
with masculinity — there are 
only a handful of women who 
have a seat at the table. This 
is constant in most comic 
books, cartoons and movies, 
including “Justice League.”

We constantly see figures 

like Batman, Spider-Man and 
Superman in major movie roles 
and in the toy section, but only 
recently have we seen Black 
Widow or Wonder Woman on 

screen and in the media. I’m 
especially angry with Marvel. 
Is Marvel going to make and 
remake movies about each 
male hero (like with the 
Spider-Man franchise), then 
eventually film a movie with 
Black Widow as the main 
character instead of one of the 
supporting 
characters? 
It’s 

made Wolverine movie after 
Wolverine 
movie; 
I’m 
left 

wondering when it’s finally 
going to make a movie about 
Storm and her origin.

Producers seem to prioritize 

recycling 
narratives 
about 

male 
superheroes 
instead 

of creating films about the 
backstory of strong female 
superheroes. Superheroes like 
Storm, Vixen and Hawkgirl 
have biographies that are just 
as interesting as Superman and 
Spider-Man (their backstories 
may actually be more interesting 
because they aren’t as well-
known), but we never get the 
chance to learn about these 
characters in movies.

With the release of this 

year’s “Wonder Woman” and 
“Justice League,” I finally 
got what I’ve wanted for 
over a decade, and a female 
superhero finally got some 
credit. I say some because 
while “Justice League” and 
“Wonder Woman” included 
Themyscira, Wonder Woman’s 
birth place, the movies don’t 
include other shots of women 
fighting and of women in 
positions of power.

Women 
in 
these 
movies 

are 
still 
mainly 
supporting 

characters, while men continue 
to 
be 
some 
of 
the 
main 

characters. Besides seeing the 
Amazons in Themyscira in 
the beginning of the film and 
Etta Candy (Steve Trevor’s 
secretary), Wonder Woman is 
the only woman who speaks 
in the film. “Justice League” 
features female characters 
(Hippolyta, 
Martha 
Kent, 

Lois Lane and Mera), but very 
few conversations involving 
these characters pass the 
final part of the Bechdel test.

The 
lack 
of 
women 
in 

influential positions and the 
constant ignoring of them is 
not specific to comic books 
or action movies. We can 
see it play out in the modern 
world 
in 
Congress, 
where 

women comprise less than 25 
percent of either house, and 
globally on corporate boards. 
Unlike in “Justice League,” 
women are not seen as a force 
to be reckoned with, but just 
something people think they 
can put their hands on when 
the mood hits them — take the 
stream of sexual harassment 
and assault allegations against 
writers, directors and even an 
editor at DC Comics.

But in “Justice League” 

and “Wonder Woman,” unlike 
reality, people took women 
seriously. The characters saw 
Wonder Woman as someone 
who is strong, intelligent and 
played a pivotal role in the 
groups she worked with. She 
often acted as a peacemaker, 
cooling tensions within the 
group. Unlike Batman, who 
was ready to jump to a decision 
without adequately evaluating 
the 
risks, 
she 
exercised 

caution when making difficult 
decisions and considered how 
her 
actions 
and 
decisions 

would affect others.

Near the end of the movie, 

when the fighting was tense 
and I stared wide-eyed at 
the screen, Wonder Woman 
says, “On my lead.” With this 
statement, she makes it clear 
that she is in charge, that she’s 
someone the characters look 
to for guidance and that she 
has the strength of character 
to call the shots. She gives 
herself 
permission 
to 
be 

“bossy,” to be assertive, an 
action that is both subversive 
and 
inspiring 
considering 

our society constantly tries 
to push women into the 
background and as far from 
any position of influence or 
power as possible.

On my lead

M

any 
people 
who 

have known me for 
a long time were 

shocked when I decided to 
join a sorority. People told 
me that joining a sorority did 
not seem to align with my 
values — I always prioritize 
school, I don’t love partying 
and I am not a “girly-girl.” 
But 
most 
importantly, 
I 

value gender equality. It was 
implied to me that being a 
feminist and joining a sorority 
were mutually exclusive. But to 
me, joining a sorority was the 
embodiment of feminism — it 
meant being a member of an all-
female organization of strong, 
passionate leaders on campus. 

My 
sorority 
experience 

has overall been positive. I 
certainly joined the sorority 
that was the best fit for me 
and 
have 
become 
friends 

with women from all over 
the country whom I likely 
wouldn’t have otherwise met.

Yet being a feminist has led 

me to identify problematic 
aspects of Greek life, most 
of which are due to the stark 
gender 
roles 
embedded 
in 

the Greek community. I hate 
getting 
emails 
about 
our 

social 
schedule 
each 
week 

encouraging us to be “fun and 
flirty” for fraternity boys. I 
hate the gendered themes of 
parties, like “Army Hoes and 
GI Joes.” I squirmed at the 
emails we received during rush 
detailing the specific shoes and 
makeup we needed to wear. I 
was constantly aware that the 
men in Greek life were never 
subject to any of these social 
pressures to act or dress a 
certain way for girls’ benefits.

The most blatant gendered 

difference 
in 
Greek 
life 

involves the alcohol policies 
in fraternities and sororities. 
Parties 
are 
only 
held 
at 

fraternity houses, where men 
provide the alcohol and control 
who is able to attend the parties 
— a “home-turf” advantage of 
sorts. Fraternities do not have 
adults living in their houses 

and are not subject to frequent 
checks for alcohol and drugs. 
Walking 
into 
a 
fraternity 

member’s room, one is likely to 
see a bottle of alcohol or a bong 
sitting out in the open.

Sororities, 
on 
the 
other 

hand, are not allowed to host 
parties. Sorority members are 
not allowed to have alcohol in 
their houses and have “house 
moms” who live with them 
to make sure the women 
are on their best behavior 
and who often dig around 
in girls’ drawers to look for 
illicit 
substances. 
While 
I 

am not encouraging either 
organization to bend the rules 
on underage drinking, I would 
like to see some equality. 
Women should not be held to 
a different standard from men, 
and if it is acceptable for men 
to drink underage, women 
should be able to as well.

Sorority women are taught 

they should never accept drinks 
given to them at fraternities, 
yet they are punished if they 
are caught with alcohol in 
their houses. The implied logic 
is that sorority women should 
not drink. However, this is 
an unrealistic aspiration and 
certainly not one that is thrust 
on fraternity men. Instead, 
men are able to patronizingly 
provide alcohol to sorority 
women 
at 
parties, 
since 

fraternities are allowed to have 
alcohol. 
Not 
coincidentally, 

sorority 
women 
are 
more 

likely to be sexually assaulted 
than other college women. 
This fact alone should indicate 
that Greek life is problematic.

There is a case to be made 

that women would be safer if 
they were implicitly allowed 
to 
have 
alcohol 
in 
their 

sororities, just as men are 
implicitly allowed to have 
alcohol in fraternities. For 
one, women should be allowed 
to drink alcohol they have 
purchased and measure the 
number of drinks they intend 
to consume. This is infinitely 
safer than taking drinks from 

strangers at fraternities, who 
could add a drug to the drink or 
simply pour more alcohol than 
the recipient can safely handle.

The recent Interfraternity 

Council 
ban 
on 
fraternity 

social activity provides an 
opportunity to sit back and 
reconsider what Greek life 
is 
really 
about. 
We 
must 

remember why we decided 
to 
join 
this 
community 

and make changes that are 
representative of our values. 
The ban on fraternity parties 
is absolutely pointless unless 
we use it as a catalyst for 
long 
overdue 
changes. 
As 

women, we do not need to be 
complacent in a system that 
creates a power imbalance 
between men and women. We 
should stand up for ourselves, 
instead of encouraging the 
perpetuation of harmful and 
unnecessary 
differences 
in 

policies based solely on gender 
for fraternities and sororities.

Fraternities allow men to 

occupy a space that makes 
taking advantage of women 
easy, and it is time to recognize 
the need for change in this 
patriarchal system. It is time to 
start treating sorority women 
the same as fraternity men. 
Maybe part of the answer is 
allowing women to have their 
own alcohol and throw parties 
— which includes managing 
who is let in and out of the 
house, rather than attending 
parties in an environment that 
puts them in danger. These 
are valid changes we must 
consider as we recognize the 
problems in our community.

At the moment, I am not 

proud to be affiliated with 
Greek life at the University 
of Michigan. I would be 
prouder of this community 
if 
we 
made 
changes 
to 

promote gender equality and 
encourage women’s safety in 
a conventionally patriarchal 
institution.

Spartans beckon in home-and-home clash

Griffin Luce was definitive 

on what he wanted to see out of 
his team this weekend.

“We’re just not gonna let 

them 
have 
the 
puck,” 
the 

sophomore defenseman said. 
“We’re gonna play with the 
puck in their end and when they 
do get the puck we’re gonna 
shut them down early.”

Luce is reiterating a sentiment 

that has been ever-present for 
the Michigan hockey team (2-4-
2 Big Ten, 6-6-2 overall) – give a 
hard-nosed and swift defensive 
performance 
that 
translates 

into a powerful offensive front.

However, 
this 
hasn’t 

happened recently, as evidenced 
by their forfeiture of eight 
goals against Ohio State last 
weekend. The Wolverines have 
one more chance this calendar 
year to reverse a recent skid, 
and it will come this weekend 
against Michigan State (1-6-1, 
7-8-1).

In terms of Big Ten rankings, 

the Spartans are the one team 
slated below Michigan, and 
the pair – alongside Ohio 
State – look up at a conference 
headlined by No. 4 Notre Dame.

“As much as we’ve played 

maybe 
inconsistently, 
we’re 

right in the thick of things,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“This is a huge weekend. If we 
can string together a couple 
real good games and we’re right 
in the thick of things in the Big 
Ten.”

The Wolverines and Spartans 

face off at Yost Ice Arena on 
Thursday, but travel to East 
Lansing on Friday for their first 
home-and-home set of the year.

Coming off an exhibition win 

earlier this week against the 
U-18 U.S. National Development 
Team Program, Michigan was 
able to notch a week of much-
needed practice.

“I definitely think we’ve used 

it to our advantage,” Pearson 
said. “I think having that game 
was very important. … We got 
to work on our power play, our 
special teams and some other 

things.”

The special teams practice 

will likely come into play 
heavily against the Spartans. 
Compared to Michigan State’s 
.203 conversion percentage on 
power-plays, the Wolverines’ is 
just .164.

Forwards 
Mitchell 

Lewandowski, 
Taro 
Hirose 

and Patrick Khodorenko have 
tallied 49 points thus far, 
making the Spartans’ leading 
line enemy number one for the 
Michigan defense.

“I think we’ll play strength 

against strength,” Pearson said. 
“We think we have three lines 
that can play against them and 
do a good job. … Obviously we’ll 
make our players aware of them, 
but I think the best way to shut 
a line down like that is to force 
them to play without the puck.”

The 
Wolverines 
are 
no 

stranger to this type of first-
line brilliance, though. Senior 
forwards Dexter Dancs and 
Tony 
Calderone, 
alongside 

junior forward Cooper Marody, 
have been present in every 

discussion of the Michigan 
offense.

The trio has combined for 

47 points so far this season, 
but 
following 
a 
standstill 

performance at Ohio State in 
which the Wolverines were 
swept at home, Pearson decided 
it would be time for a change.

While 
the 
Wolverines’ 

leading line is expected to 
remain intact, by switching 
Calderone 
and 
sophomore 

forward Will Lockwood for the 
matchup against the USNDTP, 
Pearson 
proved 
that 
those 

efforts 
for 
versatility 
were 

feasible.

“We experimented with a 

couple things this weekend,” 
Dancs said. “I think mine’s 
staying together so I think it’ll 
be good for us, we’ve had some 
success but the last few games 
we haven’t been as good as we 
were in previous weekends.”

While Michigan may have 

a slightly better conference 
record, the Wolverines must 
avoid defensive lapses to keep 
the Spartans’ offense at bay.

Sophomore defenseman Griffin Luce was blunt in saying that the Wolverines will not let Michigan State control the puck when they face off this weekend.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Marquette offense 
poses threat for ‘M’

One of the nation’s most prolific 

offenses will roll through Crisler 
Center on Thursday night – and 
it doesn’t belong to the Michigan 
women’s basketball team. 

The 24th-ranked Wolverines 

(6-2) will have their hands full 
with the potent Marquette attack, 
something coach Kim Barnes 
Arico is fully aware of.

“Marquette is a great team,” 

said Barnes Arico on WTKA. 
“They had a tremendous season 
last year and they have everyone 
returning. This will be a great 
matchup for us because this will 
be an NCAA Tournament team 
for sure.”

The Golden Eagles (4-3) rank 

16th in the NCAA scoring 84.4 
points per game, 20th in field 
goal percentage at 46.9 and 22nd 
in assists with just over 18 per 
game. For comparison, Michigan 
averages 73.1 points per game, 
shoots 46.4 percent from the field 
and amasses 14.3 assists.

Despite 
the 
statistical 

disadvantage, 
the 
Wolverines 

should be confident following two 
consecutive blowout victories. 
Michigan 
outscored 
LIU 

Brooklyn and Detroit Mercy by 
a margin of 73 points. Marquette 
however, is on a different level 
than either of the previous two 
foes. 

The Wolverines will also have 

a slight edge on defense. Led by 
senior forward Jillian Dunston, 
Michigan has allowed 62.1 points 
per game thus far. But at times 
this season, Barnes Arico and 
multiple players have admitted to 
lapses defensively. In order to beat 
a sound Golden Eagles team, the 
Wolverines must play consistent 
defense for all 40 minutes.

On the other hand, Marquette 

gives up an average of 68.3 points 
each game. This number may be 
somewhat inflated though, as a 
result of the Golden Eagles high-
tempo offense. Also, Marquette’s 
full court press – a strategy they 

run the entire game – may wear 
on the Wolverines.

“We try to practice moving 

the basketball as quickly as we 
can,” Barnes Arico said. “If you 
move the basketball, it’s hard to 
trap. So, we just try to continue 
to practice against those numbers 
and simulate those situations as 
much as possible.”

The most intriguing matchup 

– and what the game may come 
down to – lies at the guard 
positions.

Senior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
leads 
Michigan 
in 

scoring with 23 points per 
game. Since Flaherty sees time 
at both the point and shooting 
guard positions, she will match 
up against the Golden Eagles’ 
two leading scorers – guards 
Allazia Blockton and Natisha 
Hiedeman. The duo combines 
for over 33 points and eight 
assists per game.

The Wolverines will need a 

solid performance from Flaherty, 
their all time leading scorer, in 
order to come out victorious.

Another 
advantage 
for 

Michigan is its diversity on 
offense. The Wolverines’ two 
main offensive options – Flaherty 
and center Hallie Thome – allow 
Michigan to score both outside 
and in the post. If Marquette 
doubles Flaherty, expect Thome 
to see a lot of action down low. 
And on the contrary, if Thome 
sees a lot of pressure, shots will 
open up for Flaherty and sharp-
shooting junior Nicole Munger.

The 
Wolverines 
are 
still 

looking for their first top-tier win 
of the season, previously losing to 
current No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 
4 Louisville. In both matchups, 
Michigan held leads, but was 
unable to sustain success for the 
entire game. The Wolverines look 
to draw on those experiences 
Thursday night.

In order for Michigan to come 

out on top, it must receive solid 
play from its leading scorers and 
play hard-nosed defense for the 
entire game.

Beilein remains patient with rotation still in flux

A 
year 
ago 
Wednesday, 

Michigan beat Texas, 53-50, in 
a grind-it-out type of win you 
tend to see in college basketball 
in early December. 

The 
Wolverines 
went 

eight deep that day, two of 
whom 
didn’t 
take 
a 
shot. 

Derrick 
Walton 
Jr. 
played 

39 of 40 minutes, and bench 
contribution 
was 
more 

symbolic than 
reality.

It was a team 

that knew what 
it wanted to be 
— and the path 
it 
needed 
to 

take — even if 
it wasn’t there 
just yet.

Fast forward 

a year, and this 
iteration 
of 

the 
Michigan 

men’s basketball team heads 
into a game against UCLA with 
about as little clarity in its 
rotation as any team in the Big 
Ten.

Monday, in a loss to Ohio 

State, 11 Wolverines saw the 
court — including all three 
freshmen. Only senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman played more than 
32 minutes, and their four 
leading scorers on the season 
— 
Abdur-Rahkman, 
junior 

forward 
Moritz 
Wagner, 

fifth-year 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson and redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Charles 

Matthews 
— 
combined 
to 

shoot 1-for-20 in the second 
half as they let a 20-point lead 
deteriorate into a demoralizing 
nine-point loss.

Freshman 
guard 
Jordan 

Poole only played eight minutes, 
fifth-year senior guard Jaaron 
Simmons played seven first-
half minutes, freshman starting 
point guard Eli Brooks watched 
the majority of the Buckeyes’ 
furious comeback from the 
bench and sophomore guard Ibi 
Watson was the first player off 
the bench. 

This comes two days after 

Poole led the team with 19 
points, Simmons did not play, 

Watson 
didn’t 

see the floor in 
the second half 
and Brooks led 
the team with six 
assists going up 
against a fifth-
year senior.

The first step 

in 
establishing 

an 
identity 
is 

codifying 
a 

rotation.

And Michigan 

coach 
John 

Beilein seems no 

closer to doing so than he was 
at the outset of the season.

On Nov. 10, a day before the 

season-opener against North 
Florida, Beilein said he hoped 
to trim the rotation shortly into 
the season.

“(The rotation) will tighten 

up a little bit,” Beilein said. 
“I’ve always believed you can’t 
please everyone there, and 
you’re trying — perfect is an 
eight or nine man rotation. 
So depending on foul trouble, 
that’s where we’ll probably 
get to. Everyday is another 
opportunity for guys to get into 
those eight or nine.” 

After a blowout win against 

UC Riverside Nov. 26, Beilein 
addressed the subject again, 
offering little clarity yet again.

“Everyday, I’m seeing who’s 

gonna grow now. I know what 

people do, who’s going to grow 
the fastest. I anticipate some 
will grow faster,” Beilein said. 
“That’s up for grabs, and it’s 
still up for grabs. It will be 
every game, I’m just gonna go, 
‘Who practiced well? Oh, he 
practiced well? Go in.’ It won’t 
necessarily be what you see 
in games, but what we see in 
practice.”

It’s December now. Big Ten 

play has begun. The games are 
starting to matter more and 
more, and could ultimately loom 
large on an NCAA Tournament 
resume. Yet here we are.

After 
the 
game 
Monday, 

Beilein struck a now-familiar 

tone 
of 
patience 
when 

discussing the rotation. 

“This is something that’s 

going to be a journey all year 
for us until we grow our young 
kids, and our veterans embrace 
their new roles as being the 
guys, being a guy that’s gotta 
make a shot, that’s gotta make 
a play at a certain time.”

According to Beilein, the 

tight schedule makes it difficult 
to implement changes. The 
Wolverines just faced a stretch 
of 10 games in 24 days. That 
kind of condensed schedule 
allows for less consideration 
of the team’s general direction, 
and more focus on individual 

game preparation.

For 
Robinson, 
that 

inconsistency in the rotation 
— and the solidifying of roles 
— doesn’t inhibit production 
on the court, or, in the case of 
Monday’s outing in Columbus, 
provide an excuse for a lack 
thereof. He’s not ready to make 
those excuses. 

“I 
just 
want 
to 
win,” 

Robinson said in a blunt tone, 
carried over from a frustrating 
performance. 
“It 
doesn’t 

matter who has what role to 
me, I think those kind of play 
themselves out. There’s some 
identity there, knowing what 
you do well, and doing it, and 

doing your job, but we just have 
to play better.”

But at some point there will 

come a day of reckoning, when 
it comes time to make decisions 
and when patience no longer 
remains a viable option — when 
Beilein will have to decide 
whether he prefers Watson 
or Poole, which two of the 
three point guards will earn a 
majority of the minutes, who 
positions themselves to earn 
major roles and who doesn’t.

Until then, the Wolverines 

seem content to continue to 
spin the roulette wheel, waiting 
patiently until the cream rises 
to the top.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Michigan coach John Beilein said that Michigan’s rotation will be a journey until the younger players grow and the veterans embrace their larger roles.

MAX MARCOVITCH

Daily Sports Editor

It doesn’t 

matter who has 
what role to me, 

I think those 
kind of play 

themselves out.

Michigan’s coach said before the season opener that he hoped to eventually trim the rotation to eight or nine men. Eleven 
Wolverines took the floor Monday night in a loss to Ohio State, but Beilein will not be rushed in his presumed decision.


6A — Thursday, December 7, 2017
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

With the Michigan football team’s 2017 regular season in the books, the Daily 

looks back at the performance of each unit this year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2018. In this edition: linebackers 

Well, this transition went smoother than many probably 

expected.

Entering the 2017 season, the Wolverines were tasked 
with replacing Ben Gedeon in the middle of the field, 

and Jabrill Peppers’ unique role in the VIPER spot.

Sophomores Khaleke Hudson and Devin Bush 

Jr. quickly put any speculation to rest.

Hudson — who took over at VIPER — finished 

the season with 72 tackles, two interceptions, 
seven sacks and 16.5 tackles for loss. The latter 
two marks landed him fourth and third in the 

Big Ten in each respective category, and 
earned him third team All-Big Ten honors.

Not to be outdone, Bush finished with 

94 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks, 
eight pass break ups and an interception 
of his own. That production not only 
garnered first team All-Big Ten honors, but 
has also landed him among the finalists for 
the Butkus Award — an honor given annually 

to the nation’s top linebacker. 
Michigan 
found 
success 
outside 
the 

production of its two star sophomores, too. 

Redshirt junior Noah Furbush saw an increased 

role, playing in every game as a key component of 
defensive coordinator Don Brown’s new 3-3-5 stack 

formation. Furbush finished with 28 tackles and 
two fumble recoveries — one of which was a game-
sealing touchdown in the season opener against 
Florida.

Rounding out the group was fifth-year senior 

Mike McCray — the sole key contributor who 
returned to the unit. The Wolverines’ defensive 
captain finished the year with a career-high 13 
tackles for loss and 75 total tackles — two shy of 
also becoming a career high.
HIGH POINT: Like the majority of Michigan’s 

defensive unit, there was a fair share of dominant 

performances.
Bush’s coming out party came early, as he dominated the 

Gators at AT&T Stadium to open the season.

He finished that game with seven tackles — 2.5 for loss 

— and 1.5 sacks. Bush wasted no time in building off that 
momentum, as he recorded a season-high 12 tackles just two 
games later against Air Force.

He wouldn’t be in the running for the Butkus Award if those 
performances didn’t become the norm, but those two early-

season performances were highlights — especially 

when few knew what to expect out of him this 

season.

Hudson’s showing against Minnesota was one 

for the record books — literally. Against the 
Golden Gophers, he finished with 15 tackles, 
eight tackles for loss and three sacks for a loss of 
34 yards. The eight tackles for loss set program 
and conference records for a single game. 

Last but not least, McCray led the Wolverines 

with three tackles for loss against the Buckeyes, 
and finished with 11 total tackles — a mark only 
matched by Rashan Gary.

LOW POINT: The Wolverines left Happy 

Valley with a whimper in late October.

Michigan’s linebackers were no exception. 

Saquon Barkley ran all over the Wolverines, 
averaging 7.2 yards per carry and scoring 
two rushing touchdowns.

But Barkley’s 42-yard receiving touchdown 

with just over 13 minutes left in the fourth 
quarter really told the tale of the Wolverines’ 
struggles.

Barkley dusted McCray in coverage just 10 

yards into the route, making one move before 
heading straight down the right hashmarks. 
Trace McSorley had an easy throw, and he made 
it.

He found the end zone, and Michigan went 

down by 22.

Though far less concerning, Bush also went 

through a three-game stretch against Michigan 
State, Indiana and Penn State in which he didn’t 
record a single tackle for loss. Bush admitted 
he noticed that people adjusted to him, trying 
to take him out of plays. In turn, Bush adjusted 
himself, finishing the season in the same way he 
started.

Calling it a low point would be hyperbole, but 

after emerging as Michigan’s breakout star early 
in the season, Bush’s three-game spell was, at 

the very least, surprising.

THE FUTURE: Bush and Hudson will 
be back, now equipped with a full year of 

experience. Furbush has another year 

of eligibility as well. Don Brown can 
rest easy in that regard.

McCray, however, has exhausted 

his eligibility.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
return 

freshmen 
Drew 
Singleton 
and 

Jordan 
Anthony, 
along 
with 

sophomores Josh Uche and Devin 

Gil.

There 
has 
been 
little 

indication of who could fill 
McCray’s 
shoes, 
but 
the 

matchup 
against 
Florida 

at least gave a hint. After 
McCray briefly exited the 
game with an injury, Gil 

was the one to take McCray’s 

snaps.

Season Totals

Bush: 94 tackles, 9.5 for loss

Hudson: 72 tackles, 16.5 for loss
McCray: 75 tackles, 13 for loss
Furbush: 28 tackles, 1.5 for loss

the University in 1930. Mary 
Palmer, a pianist, graduated 
from the music theory program 
in 1937, and the couple married 
that same year.

It was Mary Palmer who 

reached out to Frank Lloyd 
Wright to design the home, 
and it was she who put in the 
work to see the initiative to 
completion — a trend true for 
many women with spectacled 
husbands who spend too much 
time in the study. The Palmers 
were living in a farm home 
on Geddes Avenue when they 
purchased two lots on Orchard 
Hills Drive with a generous 
donation from Mary Palmer’s 
father, who was involved in 
various banking and business 
interests. By then, they’d had 
their two children, Adrian in 
1940 and Mary Louise in 1942. 
But it wasn’t just for them that 
they wanted the new home: The 
Palmers loved to entertain, and 
found it exceedingly difficult 
to do so at the more cramped 
estate. So the Palmers shopped 
around for an architect, looking 
at local homes for inspiration. 
They were especially attracted 
to the Margaret and Harry 
Towsley home on Vinewood 
Avenue, which was owned by 
and built for the Towsleys in 
1932. Dr. Harry Towsley was a 
professor and a pediatrician at 
the University’s Medical School, 
while Margaret Towsley was 
an active community member, 
volunteering 
for 
Planned 

Parenthood, 
the 
community 

center and the Republican Party.

The Towsley home is arguably 

the beginning of the modernist 
architecture movement in Ann 
Arbor, with its flat roof and its 
garage that faced the street — 
a bold move then, and a first 
for the city. It was designed by 
Alden Dow, a Michigan architect 
who apprenticed under Wright. 
He would go on to design many 
prominent buildings in Ann 
Arbor, including the City Hall 
(on Huron Street, just down the 
street from those monstrous, 
ever-under-construction, 
brand-new student apartment 
buildings), 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

District Library, the Matthaei 
Botanical Gardens and several 
on-campus facilities.

It was Bill Palmer’s brother, 

Carlos, who first suggested to 
the Palmers at a cocktail party 
that they seek out Dow’s mentor 

himself, Frank Lloyd Wright. 
Carlos 
Palmer 
was 
familiar 

with Wright’s work, and stated 
matter-of-factly their architect 
should be, “Wright, of course.”

Though Mary and Bill Palmer 

are no longer alive, conversations 
with the family regarding the 
house were recorded by Grant 
Hildebrand 
and 
synthesized 

into a book, published nearly 
a decade ago. Cox presents a 
volume to me, titled simply 
“Frank Lloyd Wright’s Palmer 
House,” 
with 
a 
sense 
of 

inherited pride. It rests on the 
living room coffee table, which 
is shaped as a parallelogram. 
These conversations illuminate 
a 
meticulousness 
by 
the 

Palmers in planning their home, 
especially from Mary Palmer’s 
end; she speaks in big ideas, 
and with poetic eloquence. She 
explained her first time walking 
through a Wright home with her 
husband as so:

“We sensed a new experience 

immediately on entering the 
carport and on into the loggia. 
… But inside there was warmth 
everywhere — in the fireplace, in 
the beautiful cypress throughout 
the house, and in the marvelous, 
warm floors.”

And 
yet 
she 
was 
not 

immediately sold on Wright. 
She explained, “I was attracted 
to his philosophy but … did 
I really want to live in one 
of those houses?” Here, she 
gets at something that feels 
tangible walking through this 
museum-home. 
The 
almost 

overbearing intention of the 
place 
doesn’t 
necessarily 

scream “homey.” “There was no 
basement rec room, no place that 
wasn’t 
absolutely 
beautiful,” 

remembers 
the 
daughter 

Mary Louise, describing the 
tenseness that comes with such 
beauty. Indeed, there’s a strict 
atmosphere in the air as we walk 
around; Cox has disallowed 
photographs of nearly all the 
interior, since it was stayed in just 
last night. When we walk into 
the bedrooms, with the bedding 
slightly unmade, he seems a bit 
embarrassed. 
He 
apologizes. 

The house is “not quite perfect 
right now.” Yet there’s a comfort 
in seeing the parallelogram beds 
imperfect, some humanity in 
those wrinkled sheets.

But on the drive home from 

a visit to a Wright house, Mary 
Palmer explained that she and 
Bill Palmer looked one another 
in the eyes and said, “Let’s get 
Mr. Wright,” and so they — or 
rather, she — did. Wright was 
83 and it was May when Mary 
Palmer tracked him down at 
North Carolina State University. 
Wright was giving a lecture 
to their architectural school, 
and Palmer approached him 
and gave him extensive notes 
about the plot on Orchard Hills. 
Wright accepted the job, and 
replied to Palmer: “Now you go 
back to your husband and take 
care of those children. They 
need to live in one of my houses. 
I’ll take these things with me.”

Wright 
presented 
the 

Palmers with the original “plan 
geometry” in January 1951, and 
Mary, one of the few Wright 
homeowners 
to 
push 
back 

successfully on parts of his plan, 
made a few changes. Red brick 
was exchanged for the concrete 
originally proposed; a shower 
was added, an amenity which 
Wright was often reluctant to 
include in his homes, being a 
man of baths himself. After 
revisions, construction began 
that April, and the house was 
completed the following year, 
just in time for the Christmas of 
1952.

Mary Palmer, like her home, 

was a woman strict in her 
structure. Cox pauses while 
describing her, and lands on 
“feisty” — “quite a gal.” She often 
told her children to maintain 
“visual order,” in their home, and 
in all things, and her son Adrian 
later complained that he missed 
a place where he could “have just 
messed around.” There seems to 
be a price paid for the home’s 
impeccable beauty. Still, he says 
he later recognized the higher 
pleasure of the home — and, 
unspoken but understood, of his 
own mother’s order.

Mary Palmer was integral to 

the local community, heading 
the Ann Arbor music society 
and often hosting elaborate 
recitals in her home, where she 
kept a Steinway Grand for such 
occasions. She had an interest 
in the spiritual and bodily, and 
became dedicated to yoga later 
in her life. A remembrance for 
her, published by the National 
Iyengar Yoga Association after 
her death in 2011, describes 
her passion for the practice. 
According to the piece, Palmer’s 
fascination with yoga began 
in the ’60s; the passion, as the 
story goes, blossomed from her 
studies under B.K.S. Iyengar of 
India. Palmer tracked him down 
in 1969, and sat in on his classes 
for nearly three weeks before 
he would speak with her. He 
had seen her as another of the 
floating tourist types from the 
United States who were common 
in this period of Revolver and 
Sgt. Pepper’s, coming only for 
photos and a story to bring back 
West. But Palmer was not, and 
proved her allegiance with a 
15-minute headstand.

A line from her book on the 

subject 
elaborates 
on 
such 

dedication:

“The lure of yoga demands 

from one the highest potential. 
At the same time it reveals one’s 
weaknesses. The moment of 
truth cannot be experienced 
without the constant play of 
these opposing forces.”

Palmer 
passed 
away 
in 

2011. She had been living in a 
“memory facility” in Ypsilanti, 
as Cox describes it, for the last 
few years of her life.

House on Orchard Hills: Frank 
Llyod Wright’s modernist haven

B-SIDE LEAD

Consider 
triangles, 
and 

consider 
geometry. 
These 

structures are here, literally 
and 
in 
spirit: 
The 
small 

interior benches are triangles; 
the shower is a triangle; the 
lampshades are triangles; the 
roof, too, is a triangle, though 
it’s an especially idiosyncratic 
example. Consisting of cedar 
shingles and wooden fascias, 
it folds downward just slightly 
and moves into an aggressive 
point in the backyard, where it 
hangs over a patio that expands 
into the grass. The roof looks 
almost like a spaceship, moving 
through the stars — except this 
spaceship stands among blowing 
leaves, and atop a hill. That is, 
it’s almost winter now, and the 
trees are beginning to prepare 
for it, shedding their green and 
yellow onto the ground, making 
a red circle around the wooden 
bench in the backyard. The 
circle of red leaves is fallen from 
the apple tree that stands behind 
the bench. The roof looks right 
at it. 

Geometry can be confusing. 

There’s an adage that parents 
tell their children who are 
bad at geometry: If you’re bad 
at geometry, you’ll be good at 
algebra. If you’re bad at algebra, 
you’ll be good at geometry. For 
those kids in the first camp, 
who took to numbers rather 
than shapes, geometry might 
have felt forced, oddly unreal — 
inapplicable — with its sines and 
cosines, linear planes and precise 
measurements of the angles of a 
hexagon. The consequences of 
3.14 and antipodal points might 
feel too abstract and separated 
from the ball you smack in a 
tennis match. It can be hard to 

see how math relates at all to 
this strange-ceilinged home on 
a hill.

But there is an approachable 

geometry 
at 
Frank 
Lloyd 

Wright’s Palmer House, situated 
at the top of Orchard Hills Drive, 
right on the edge of Ann Arbor’s 
city limits. When you drive up the 
lightly graveled driveway after 
curving back and forth a few 
times, you first notice the sharp 
edges of the outdoor garage. 
There’s a flat awning supported 
by triangular brick columns for 
vehicles, and for most cars, the 
back bumper will stick out just 
a little farther than the awning 
supports. Then you notice more 
shapes. There are the long and 
thin rectangular prisms of the 
stairs that lead to the front door, 
and a corner of the home stands 
to the left of the stairs (when you 
enter, you’ll then notice this is 
the kitchen), with two separate, 
horizontal rows of identical 
designs running through it. 
These are little windows cut 
into concrete blocks, and there 
are 40 of them that surround 
the kitchen, though only about 
half face out to the stairs by the 
entryway. This is a structure 
with a meticulousness for edges 
and lines. It feels hyperaware of 
where the eye will go, and where 
it wants to lead it. This home’s 
geometry leads first to the door.

The two front doors are in 

the French style and could 
pass as windows, if it weren’t 
for the dainty handles at waist 
level. Gary Cox, a resident of 
Plymouth, opens one. Cox is 
wearing a horizontally striped 
polo and blue jeans, and his 
rimless reading spectacles sit on 
a counter, facing the entryway.

Cox is the father of the 

current owner of the Palmer 
House, Jeffrey Schox. Schox, 
who does not live in Ann Arbor, 

is a graduate of the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
mechanical 

engineering program, and he 
now runs a patent law firm 
focused on startups; it has a 
sleek website that uses words 
like “transparency,” “passion” 
and “excellence.” He also has 
a soul patch, and resides in San 
Francisco.

Cox is responsible for most 

of the daily upkeep of the home, 

which now operates as a guest 
house 
year-round. 
(This 
is 

discounting assorted holidays. 
The family likes to spend their 
Christmases here.) He gives the 
rare tour and checks on the state 
of the infrastructure. Cox walks 
into the living room, where he 
begins to revel in his knowledge 
of the home. The room feels 
massive, though by square feet 
it’s a little larger than most 
American lounges.

Cox meets each client before 

turning over the keys, and this 

is at least in part for vetting 
purposes. 
He 
reserves 
the 

right, he says, to turn a renter 
away at the door if he feels it’s 
necessary. But he has never done 
so, and these door greetings 
act more as an introduction to 
the home, which Cox says is 
the most difficult part of his 
job. To articulate to the clients 
what this all means; “to get the 
clients to … understand,” he 
says, requires this introduction. 
Cox speaks eloquently, at times 
impassionedly, when he talks 
about the Palmer House. He 
sometimes chuckles slightly as 
he recounts the details of the 
lives of the original owners. 
He has given this talk and tour 
many times — gave it just last 
week, to a group of students 
from the University’s Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning.

Keeping the name, “Palmer 

House,” is one of the stipulations 
for owning the home, which was 
designed by famed American 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright 
in the early 1950s. The home is 
under easement by the National 
Register of Historic Places, and 
beyond keeping the title, the 
new owners must also consult 
— and get approval from — the 
conservatory register to make 
any design changes, no matter 
how mundane. Every so often, 
the conservatory register makes 
a visit to inspect conditions. He 
speaks on these visits as if they 
were coffee dates among friends, 
chatting about the latest shift in 
furniture.

The title comes from the 

home’s original owners, William 
Palmer and his wife, Mary. Both 
were graduates of the University. 
William Palmer, known more 
commonly as Bill, or Billy, 
became a professor of economics 
after earning his master’s from

But inside there 

was warmth 

everywhere — 

in the fireplace, 

in the beautiful 

cypress 

throughout the 

house, and in 

the marvelous, 

warm floors.


If you ask someone to name 

the architectural centers of the 
United States, they’ll probably 
respond 
with 
Washington, 

D.C., or some other signature 
metropolis 
like 
Chicago. 

Surprisingly, thanks to the 
vision of a local leader, the small 
Midwestern town of Columbus, 
Ind., tops many lists as an 
architectural icon. Scattered 
throughout 
Columbus 
are 

the Modernist works of Eero 
Saarinen — designer of the 
famous 
Gateway 
Arch 
in 

St. Louis, Missouri, and the 
University’s School of Music 
— as well as other significant 
architects.

First-time 
writer-director 

Kogonada 
features 
these 

buildings in his recent film, 
“Columbus” — a breathtaking 
arthouse drama that follows 
the 
intertwining 
lives 
of 

Jin (John Cho, “Harold and 
Kumar Go To White Castle”), 
Casey (Haley Lu Richardson, 
“The Edge of Seventeen”) and 
the town of Columbus itself. 
Eero Saarinen’s asymmetrical 
church, 
I.M. 
Pei’s 
Cleo 

Rogers 
Memorial 
Library 

and several design treasures 
get 
their 
moment 
in 
the 

spotlight. 
Cinematographer 

Elisha Christian (“Everything 
Sucks!”) 
incorporates 
this 

striking architecture in her 
takes, 
letting 
monumental 

features 
like 
Saarinen’s 

192-foot spire on the North 
Christian Church pop from the 
background.

When Jin’s estranged father, 

a 
renowned 
architectural 

historian, falls into a sudden 
coma, Jin finds himself stuck 
in suburban Indiana. Korean 
family values trap him in a state 
of purgatory — drifting between 
the hospital, his father’s inn 
room and conversations with 
Casey, a young girl with a wise 
mind. Casey acts as Jin’s tour 
guide, taking him to her favorite 
architectural haunts. Against 
the backdrop of “Columbus”’s 
stunning 
landscape, 
the 

two form a friendship and 
attempt to answer the difficult 
question: What do we owe our 
parents?

Kogonada 
aids 
this 

inquisition with the use of 
mirrors 
to 
observe 
their 

interactions with the world. 
Many of the buildings Casey 
showcases to Jin feature glass 
as the main medium, allowing 
the camera to capture intimate 
moments in reflections. When 
Jin 
reminisces 
about 
his 

relationship with his father, 

he is only shown through the 
inn’s ornate mirror. Similarly, 
when Casey speaks of the duty 
she feels to her mother, she 
appears in the car rearview 
mirror. At one point, Kogonada 
treats a window as a two-way 
mirror, placing the audience 
on the other side of the glass as 
Casey silently explains why a 
particular building moves her 
so much.

The bond Casey feels with 

her mother strongly contrasts 
that of Jin and his father. Casey 
finds nothing more fulfilling 
than giving back to a parent 
— a sacrifice Jin struggles to 
reconcile with. In fact, Casey 
opted out of college to remain in 
Indiana and care for her mother, 
a former addict. Kogonada uses 
the polarity of their opinions 
to further weave the concept 
of mirrors into the film. The 
two characters change in ways 
that are reflections of one 
another: As Jin resolves to stay 
by his father’s bedside, Casey 
finds the strength to leave her 
mother’s home.

In addition, one of the final 

scenes of the film itself is 
a mirror of the first. Set in 
Saarinen’s Miller House that 
pulsates with natural light, 
a sequence of events plays 
out in a poignantly similar 
fashion. “Columbus” opens on 

Eleanor (Parker Posey, “Dazed 
and 
Confused”) 
running 

through the Miller House to 
find her boss, Jin’s father. She 
finds him contemplating the 
manicured yard, surrounded 
by an expanse of green trees. 
When this excerpt repeats, 
it is Casey looking for Jin, 
eventually finding him in the 
exact same place his father 
stood. Through these reflected 
scenes, 
Kogonada 
expresses 

the complex nature of parent-
child relationships, a timeless 
issue that surpasses cultural 
and generational differences.

Like a cheeky hint of what 

to pay attention to, a short 
film by Kogonada precedes 
the feature set to the words 
of Sylvia Plath’s iconic poem, 
“Mirror.” A series of movie 
clips show women of various 
ages interacting with mirrors, 
displaying 
the 
meditative 

and 
captivating 
power 
of 

architecture. 
“Columbus” 

carries this theme throughout 
in its contemplative pacing 
and cinematography, providing 
insight to the answer of what 
we owe our parents. Although 
Kogonada 
ultimately 
leaves 

this question unanswered, he 
suggests there are revelations 
to be found through examining 
these two characters closely — 
as if looking in a mirror.

When I walked up to the home, 

I noticed a crack in the window 
next the door on the right. It was 
shaped like a semicircle, clear 
among the seamless infinity 
windows and elegant French 
doors. Cox makes no mention 
of how it got there, and does 
not address it until a crew pulls 
up and opens the door amid his 
sentence. He apologizes and 
walks over to attend to them as 
they enter the home with their 
equipment, quite nonchalant. 
Cox had been talking about 
furniture. 

As with most of the homes 

Wright designed, he included 
plans for furniture, beds and 
even 
ceramic 
dinnerware, 

envisioning the home down to 
the smallest details. The dining 
room table had been owned by 
the Palmers before, but the rest 
required special construction, 
and cups and plates sit out 
perfectly arranged near the 
dining table. The living room 
was designed with the Steinway 
Grand that Mary Palmer loved 
in mind; her favorite tune was 
apparently “Bless This House.” 
But the piano has been removed, 
and the living room does feel 
a bit absent without it. Cox 
informs me that the piano was 
sold to Ben Folds, the popular 
songwriter from North Carolina, 
who was apparently acquainted 
with Palmer.

The Palmer House was placed 

on the market in August 2008, in 
the midst of the Great Recession. 
It was also just a month after 
Mary Louise passed away, the 
only daughter of the Palmers, 
for reasons Cox will not discuss. 
That left Adrian as the only 
surviving member of the family; 
but he is now a professor at a 
college in Utah, and has little 
reason to come back to Ann 
Arbor. The home was listed for 
a cool $1.5 million when it was 
purchased by Jeffrey Schox.

Cox tells the story of Jeffrey’s 

interest in the home. Jeffrey, an 
avid runner while a student at the 
University, grew infatuated with 
the Palmer House as he passed it 
on his routes around the Nichols 
Arboretum. He was especially 
intrigued by its strangely shaped 
roof. 
He 
apparently 
started 

planning his runs specifically 
to pass the home, and in the 
process, fell in love with it, and 
fell in love with Wright. Schox 
wrote a letter to Adrian Palmer 
once it was put on the market, 
expressing 
his 
fascination 

with the Palmer House and his 
interest in purchasing it, and 
outlined his plans to turn it into 
a guest home. Palmer responded, 
“My mother would be proud.”

Beyond removing the piano, 

the new owners have largely 
kept what once was. As we 
walk around the home — with 
Cox explaining in appreciation 
the expanded ceilings in the 
bedrooms, the hill in relation 
to rooms, the use of space — I 

notice the books that line the 
narrow hallway to the study, 
bearing titles like “500 Cups,” 
“Treasures of Ancient” and 
“Healing 
Heart.” 
There are 

Sumi ink posters throughout 
the home too, in the entryway, 
in the kitchen, in the hallways. 
This was all left from the 
family, as Cox confirms, perhaps 
tokens brought back by Mary 
Palmer, an enthusiast of Eastern 
Hemisphere travel. In the study 
is a photograph of the builder of 
the home, Erwin Niethammer, 

which was also left by the 
Palmers.

It’s almost like the design, 

the construction and everyone 
involved 
in 
both 
became 

residents of the home as easily 
as the Palmers did. They must 
have kept Wright in mind, for 
example, 
as 
they 
prepared 

food in the kitchen: There are 
no handles in there, as Wright 
thought they would ruin its look. 
Each drawer must be pulled open 
by the bottom, so to open the 
very top one, you must pull the 

bottom four open first, lowest 
to highest. Cox guesses that 
Mary Palmer would have left 
the drawers open for ease in her 
daily life, and then quickly close 
them as she saw guests arrive 
in the driveway through the 
kitchen windows. When I try to 
open one of the upper cabinets, 
I find it surprisingly tricky, and 
it takes me at least four attempts 
to open and close it successfully.

I can examine the little 

designs in the kitchen now, the 
same ones which ran parallel to 

the stairway I ascended to the 
entrance. It’s harder to make out 
the exact design from outside, 
but inside I can see now how 
it sinks into the concrete. Cox 
describes the image as a bird in 
flight, the symbol of the Palmer 
House — it keeps to the distaste 
for perpendicular lines here, 
and its aggressive attention to 
triangles. This design is original 
to the home, as Wright liked to 
add a defining feature to each 
of his residential works. When 
the sun sets in the West over 

the driveway, it shines through 
these small designs, throwing 
shapes of light all throughout 
the house. Cox explains this 
with competitive joy, like a tour 
guide describing a University 
tradition.

I let Cox attend to the cracked 

window and the fixing crew, and 
walked around the perimeter of 
the home. Its size is continually 
surprising; just when I thought 
the structure ended, there’s 
another offshoot, another little 
detail I’ve missed. There’s the 
occasional 
triangular 
bricks 

in the ground for walking, and 
a small, pleasing light fixture 
that looks especially Japanese 
in inspiration. You can almost 
hear a stream babbling near, 
though the stream that passed 
by the home dried long ago. 
The closest water source is the 
Huron River, over a mile away. 
The tranquility is astounding, 
almost 
shocking 
given 
the 

locale, seeing as the drive passes 
right 
by 
several 
fraternity 

houses, so many of which are 
currently embroiled in some 
pesky scandals surrounding a 
few assorted felonies. Those 
Victorian façades, which are 
luxurious and imposing, seem 
antithetical to Wright’s style.

There’s 
such 
an 
ease 
in 

becoming abstract in this place. 
The very physical and real home 
that sits on this hill, through 
which a family lived, married 
and died, conjures up an almost 
inexplicable emotional response. 
That feeling sits somewhere 
between the precision of its 
geometry and the casual bend 
of the trees above it. It works 
because it feels natural and 
unforced, as if every home should 
look as if it glides past Saturn. 
Despite the oversaturation of the 
word “organic” when speaking 
of Wright, it still comes to mind. 
That word can feel empty when 
applied to his works, given its 
oversaturation. And yet, there is 
probably no better descriptor to 
capture the essence of what it’s 
like to walk through, and to look 
upon, one of his buildings.

The Palmer House is one of 

the last in a line of hundreds 
of residences he designed, and 
though it maintains the thread 
among his many works, it is, 
as each other, unique. At this 
point in his career, so close to 
the end of his life, he pushed 
experiments with form as far 
as they could stretch. Take 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum, for example, which 
he designed at the same time 
as the Palmer’s home. There, 
he fixated on the circle; here, 
he’s taking on the triangle. 
Wright was showing a fixation 
with specific shapes as themes, 
as delineators of the story each 
project was meant to tell. That 
theme could shift with each 
home to reflect the personality 
of the land and the people who 
were to live on it.

SMTD ‘Violet’ to explore 
identity and race onstage

The Department of Musical 

Theatre’s studio production of 
“Violet” opens this Thursday at the 
Arthur Miller Theater. Recently 
nominated for four revival Tony 
Awards in 2014, “Violet” follows 
the story of a young girl, the 
eponymous Violet, as she travels 
by bus from Spruce Pine, North 
Carolina to Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Along the way, Violet befriends the 
other bus passengers and begins to 
learn more about herself.

The musical is an adaptation 

of Doris Betts’ short story “The 
Ugliest Pilgrim.” It features many 
different styles of music like gospel 
and rock.

Violet suffers from a scar she 

received in a childhood accident. 
The scar is not depicted on stage, 
however, and the audience is left to 
imagine it based on the reactions 
of other people. The play focuses 
on Violet’s discomfort with her 
physical appearance and struggle 
to overcome her inner fears.

“Everyone has struggled with 

self-doubt,” said SMTD senior 
Natalie Duncan, who also plays 
Violet, in an interview with The 
Daily. In this instance, it is about 
“America and the world’s pressure 
on women. Your worth is not in 
how men see you. I can say that 
I struggle with that” — this is 
“something that I want to fight for 
everyday of my life.”

“We can all look at ourselves and 

know that at some level we have a 
scar,” said director Mark Madama, 
Associate Professor of Musical 
Theatre. “She considered herself 
not to be pretty because she has a 
scar ... we don’t ever know how big 
that scar is.”

In addition to self-worth, the 

play also explores race as Violet 
begins to fall in love with Flick, a 
Black soldier also riding the bus 
played by SMTD junior Justin 
Showell. Throughout the play, 
Violet learns to move past Flick’s 
race and understand him on a 
personal level. Set in 1964, this 

radical 
change 
belies 
Violet’s 

transition 
to 
understanding 

herself.

“Racial issues have always been 

a prominent part of our society for 
as long as we’ve been America,” 
Madama said.

“Me being Black is not an 

affliction, it’s not a disfigurement,” 
Showell said. “Flick sees Violet the 
way that the audience does the 
entire time ... by the end, Violet 
learns to see Flick in the same way.”

The play ultimately revolves 

around 
becoming 
comfortable 

with oneself, transcending one’s 
inner fears and reaching one’s full 
potential.

“We often, in ourselves, cannot 

see our full potential,” Showell said. 
“We often put shades and layers 
over ourselves and only do what we 
are perceived to be capable of.”

“Even though the show is set in 

1964, so much of the themes are 
relevant today,” Duncan said. “It’s 
timeless in a way.”

“It’s about being able to accept 

yourself,” Madama said. “Being 
able to know yourself, being able 
to love yourself. It’s about finding 
where you fit into this world and 
not trying to be something you’re 
not.”

After being premiered in 1997, 

“Violet” recently underwent a 
critically 
acclaimed 
Broadway 

revival which featured big names 
such as Sutton Foster and Joshua 
Henry. With this popular run in 
mind, the cast have been working 
to find their own interpretation of 
the work.

“There’s never going to be 

another Violet that has these exact 
components,” Duncan said. “I am 
working on finding what about 
Violet I have in myself.”

“There’s a lot of elements that 

have to be told honestly,” Madama 
said. “It becomes about you because 
you try to figure out what’s going 
on in the story. It’s coming out of 
your way of looking at the world.”

There 
are 
a 
“plethora 
of 

different styles that still manage 
to be consistent,” Showell said. It 
“gives each of the characters their 
own voice.”

Though it takes place more than 

50 years ago, “Violet” is a topical 
exploration of the many things 
that bring us together as humans, 
and the means by which we can 
transcend the few things that keep 
us apart. It’s about checking your 
preconceived notions and learning 
to understand one another on an 
emotional level.

“It 
gives 
everybody 
an 

opportunity to see themselves 
differently,” Showell said. “If you 
are able to take on some of the 
encouragement that others see in 
you, what aren’t you capable of?”

Revitalizing Motor City 
through urban planning

Detroit — a city whose past 

reminds us of the American 
Dream. 
Once 
drenched 
in 

streamlined 
chrome 
and 

automated wonder, Detroit was 
the hottest city this side of the 
Mississippi. Yet, in July 2013, 
Detroit 
became 
the 
largest 

U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, 
leaving the nation and world 
wondering: 
What 
happened 

to Motor City? What caused 
this once-booming city center 
of culture and life to drown 
in over $18 billion of debt? 
Many have neglected the glory 
days of Detroit’s past, making 
it difficult to see the beauty 
that once was. Now, in the 
eyes of the broader American 
public, the city is decrepit, 
abandoned 
and 
forgotten. 

However, not everyone has 
forgotten 
about 
Detroit. 

Margaret 
Dewar, 
emeritus 

professor of urban and regional 
planning at the University of 
Michigan’s Taubman College 
of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning, has devoted much of 
her career to research centered 
around 
Detroit’s 
decline. 

Ellie Schneider, director of 
advocacy at DC3 is working to 
rebuild Detroit through design. 
Dewar and Schneider have not 
forgotten about Detroit, rather 
they live for the Motor City and 
want to restore it to its former 
glory.

Let’s 
start 
from 
the 

beginning. Henry Ford test 
drove his first car on the streets 
of Detroit in 1896, spearheading 
the industrial revolution of 
the Motor City thanks to his 
innovative building strategy, 
the assembly line. By the early 
20th century, industry was 
blowing up in Detroit, and 
during World War II, the same 
efficient car-building methods 
helped to quickly produce war-
winning weapons for the Allied 
Powers.

“Its peak population was 

recorded 
in 
1950, 
about 

1.85 million people,” Dewar 
explains. About this time, Berry 
Gordy was making waves in the 
music industry with his record 
company, 
Motown 
Records. 

Gordy himself was inspired by 
the Motor City for more than 
just the name of his record 
company. He used “quality

control” strategies similar 

to those of auto industry fame 
to ensure the creation of the 
best products possible. Gordy’s 
label gave birth to the gospel-
meets-blues-meets-good-time 
sound of Diana Ross, Smokey 
Robinson and the Jackson Five, 
to name a few.

The 1950s were good years in 

Detroit, when it was the fourth-
largest city in the United States. 
The auto industry was thriving 
and Motown tunes could be 
heard from the Fox Theater to 
the Detroit River. People wanted 
to live in Detroit: It was fun, and 
there were jobs.. However, the 
city began to crowd, eventually 
leading to, as Dewar puts it, “the 
suburbanization of households.” 
The city was getting too small 
for the multitudes of people 
who wanted to live there, 
leading to a mass exodus to 

the 
surrounding 
suburban 

areas. Yet, not everyone could 
leave the smog for the clean 
air 
and 
spacious 
yards 
of 

Farmington Hills or Bloomfield 
Hills. 
The 
“suburbanization 

of 
households” 
was 
highly 

selective in the sense that only 
privileged, white families could 
move to the suburbs, whereas 
Black people were prevented 
from living in such areas due to 
racist policies.

“At the same time, industrial 

processes 
changed 
so 
that 

single story plants were much 
more efficient for access to 
highways, 
as 
transportation 

was changing from railways to 
trucks,” Dewar said.

Therefore, many of the jobs 

that once required city living 
were 
suburbanized 
through 

the 
highways 
and 
change 

in 
transportation 
methods. 

Interestingly enough, Dewar 
said 
after 
World 
War 
II, 

Detroit had the same number 
of 
manufacturing 
jobs 
as 

people living in the city. In 
summary, 
Detroit’s 
decline, 

according to Dewar, was caused 
by “relocation of jobs and 
relocation of people and that 
meant loss of city revenues.” 
The city began to have greater 
and greater difficulty providing 
the kinds of services people 
would expect of their municipal 
government, which, as Dewar 
concludes, “drives more people 
out.” Now, the city that once 
boasted a population of 1.85 
million in 1950 has lost over 60 
percent of its population.

Seeing what happens after 

abandonment is exactly what 
Dewar’s research addresses. In 
the book she edited alongside 
June 
Manning 
Thomas, 

centennial professor of urban 
and 
regional 
planning 
at 

Taubman College, “The City 
After 
Abandonment,” 
the 

duo asks three big questions: 
What does a city look like after 
abandonment? 
What 
kinds 

of policies and changes make 
a difference in what the city 
becomes? And what should such 
cities become? Looking at other 
cities that have experienced 
population decline on a smaller 
scale, like Cleveland, and what 
kind of institutions they put 
in place to improve quality of 
life, influence what types of 
programs can be put in place to 
truly effect positive change in 
Detroit.

For Detroit, it seems, the 

original purpose of the urban 
planner — to manage growth and 
development — is unnecessary. 
However, 
Dewar’s 
research 

raises another question: What 
is the job of the urban planner 
when there is no growth, 
when there is no development? 
Therefore, 
Dewar’s 
work 

is focused on adding to the 
development of the city and 
creating an environment in 
which it is lucrative for people 
to come back to Detroit. For 
example, right now she is 
working with a task force to try 
to refinance affordable housing 
in Detroit.

When asked where she hopes 

Detroit will be in 10 years, 
Dewar responds with a laundry 
list of things that need to occur 
to revitalize and renew the city.

“Improving quality of life 

with better city services, more 
reasonable property tax levels, 
so it’s not so expensive to live 
there,” are important to Dewar 
in ensuring the rebuilding of 
Detroit. She knows it is a lot 
to ask for, but Dewar imagines 
a Detroit where people of all 
incomes, races and backgrounds 
can live together in harmony. 
She wants Detroit to be a place 
where people want to live, 
where there are jobs available 
and reasonable living.

Dewar was drawn to the 

University initially because of 
its proximity to Detroit and the 
opportunity to “engage with 
the people and communities of 
Detroit,” as well as because she 
is “fascinated with the fortunes 
of big cities.” Ellie Schneider, 
on the other hand, came into 
her role in rebuilding Detroit 
as a lifelong Detroiter with a 
background as a bankruptcy 
attorney. Now Schneider is 
Director of Advocacy at DC3, 
Detroit 
Creative 
Corridor 

Center, an organization working 
to revitalize Detroit through 
design. Schneider explains DC3 
as an “economic development 
organization 
focused 
on 

strengthening Detroit’s creative 
economy 
and 
connecting 

people to it.” This manifests 
itself 
primarily 
in 
helping 

small businesses and creative 
practitioners to help build the 
market for design in Detroit 
making it a hub for creative 
businesses and activities.

Schneider 
highlights 

DC3’s network of designers, 
Creative 
Co. 
Through 
this 

network DC3 offers services 
for small businesses, including 
help securing contracts and 
connecting 
designers 
with 

potential 
clients. 
DC3 
also 

supports activities and events 
to highlight the creative talent 
in Detroit. Schneider points 
out Drinks Design and the 
Detroit Design Festival as a few 
prime examples of emphasizing 
the 
creative 
communities 

emerging throughout the city. 
One of the biggest efforts of 
DC3 occurred in 2015, when 
UNESCO 
appointed 
Detroit 

as the only city in the United 
States as a certified UNESCO 
City of Design. DC3 played a 
huge role in helping Detroit 
obtain 
this 
designation 
— 

Schneider 
reports 
that 
she 

handled a lot of the application 
process. Since that victory, DC3 
has been focused on the ways 
in which design, as Schneider 
said, 
“can 
help 
Detroit 
to 

become a more sustainable and 
equitable city over the next 
10 years.” Schneider and DC3 
want to harness the creative 
energy of Detroit and use it to 
revitalize, renew and repower 
the city, because according to 
her, “creativity and design play 
a role in building a stronger city 
and community altogether.”

Detroit’s 
new 
title 
as 
a 

UNESCO 
City 
of 
Design 

means that it is now a part of a 
global network of cities from 
Cape Town, South Africa, to 
Shenzhen, 
China, 
focused 

on creativity and using that 
creativity 
to 
strengthen 

the 
economy 
and 
increase 

opportunities for the city’s 
residents. Schneider explains: 
“This 
network 
puts 
value 

BECKY PORTMAN

on culture in the intangible 
sense.” Everything in culture, 
from furniture to film and 
gastronomy to galleries helps 
to create jobs and build a better, 
more sustainable city.

Now the question is: What can 

Detroit do with its designation 
as a UNESCO City of Design? 
What does this mean for the 
future of the city? According to 
Schneider, it means looking at 
other cities and how they have 
used this designation to their 
advantage and then looking at 
Detroit’s 
unique 
perspective 

to improve the city. The plan 
for DC3 and Detroit City of 
Design, Schneider hopes, will be 
“reflective of what our strengths 
and challenges are as a city.”

One may see Detroit as a 

sports city, a music city or even 
a motor city, but Schneider sees 
the future of Detroit as a city of 
design, and the future is now. 
Schneider 
reports: 
“Detroit 

houses the highest concentration 
of commercial and industrial 
designers in the country.” The 
hope is that through education, 
programming and policy the 
future designers of Detroit will 
see the power in the creative. 
Schneider explains there are a 
lot of great things happening in 
Detroit as far as design, “from 
the super corporate to the 
super grassroots,” but they are 
disconnected. Therefore, in the 
future DC3 hopes to cultivate a 
better network and community 
centered 
around 
a 
mutual 

respect and passion for design.

When asked where she sees 

Detroit in 10 years, Schneider 
said she wants design to play a 
bigger, more visible role in the 
city’s economy. This seems like 
an attainable reality thanks 
to the work at DC3. Yet, one 
cannot speak of the future 
without mentioning children; 
as 
the 
immortal 
Whitney 

Houston declared in “Greatest 
Love of All,” “I believe the 
children are our future / Teach 
them well and let them lead 
the way.” Therefore, Schneider 
emphasizes her hope that young 
designers will pursue careers 
in the field of design. But 
first, there needs to be a shift 
in mentalities to ensure that 
today’s youth are encouraged to 
pursue their creative passions 
instead of being deterred by lack 
of funds for the arts in public 
schools or preconceived and 
archaic notions that pursuing a 
creative career is a life sentence 

to starving artist status.

It is no shock that like many 

creative fields, design is lacking 
in terms of diversity. Schneider 
hopes that she can change that 
with education, workshops and 
hands-on creative opportunities 
for children. The future shakers 
and makers of Detroit are the 
children. Therefore, DC3 puts 
a huge emphasis on supporting 
programs and institutions that 
help to enhance the creative, 
young minds at work in Detroit. 
This starts with cultivating 
talent and letting kids know 
creative jobs are possible. Grace 
in Action and Living Arts are 
two of countless programs put 
in place to empower Detroit’s 
youth through art and design, 
from screen printing to graphic 
design. In addition, institutions 
of higher education are trying 
to appeal to a high school 
student audience as well in 
order to promote talent and 
curiosity. 
The 
University’s 

own 
Architecture 
Prep 

program 
introduces 
Detroit 

high schoolers to the practice 
of 
architecture 
through 
a 

semester-long 
college 
prep 

course on the discipline. In 
addition, Lawrence Technology 
University 
provides 
summer 

programs 
for 
high 
school 

students in order to cultivate 
future students of technology 
and design.

DC3 is not trying to create 

new programs — Schneider said 
that would be “impossible and 
irresponsible.” There are great 
programs 
and 
organizations 

in Detroit doing amazing work 
and DC3 wants to strengthen 
and support what is already 
out there instead of launching 
something new. One thing DC3 
will be launching in early 2018 
is its full strategy for cultivating 
Detroit’s creative economy over 
the next 10 years. Schneider 
guarantees “the education piece 
is absolutely imperative in order 
to think about any strategy that 
will be effective in 10 years … I 
mean we are talking about the 
people who will be Detroit’s 
designers 10 years from now.”

“At this time in the world right 

now so many of us are closing in 
and withdrawing,” Schneider 
said. “I feel so fortunate that 
Detroit has this connection 
right now to these other cities 
around the world, dealing with 
a lot of the same challenges we 
are.” This global network of 
cities has been brought together, 

despite geographical or cultural 
barriers, for their passion for 
design and change. “For us to 
be able to not only see what 
other cities are doing, but also 
to promote the really innovative 
ways 
in 
which 
Detroit 
is 

navigating,” 
Schneider 
said. 

Yet, Detroit has a different 
perspective; 
as 
Schneider 

explained, “we have basically 
no government resources to 
support our work.” Therefore, 
now more than ever a platform 
for the exchange of ideas and a 
network built on innovations 
is crucial for the change that 
needs to occur.

Outsiders 
see 
Detroit 
as 

a city that is stuck in the 
past. Yet, there are those few 
revolutionaries that see beyond 
the Detroit of yesterday and 
look forward to the Detroit of 
tomorrow. As cheesy as that 
may sound, the people who are 
changing the city for the better 
are doing so from the ground up.

For 
some, 
like 
Margaret 

Dewar, this means literally 
from the ground up. From a 
glance, the green spaces in 
Detroit are a lovely addition 
to the surrounding grayness. 
But did you know that urban 
planners are using installations 
of greenery to control water 
and prevent an over-flooding of 
sewage systems? That unseen 
work of the unsung urban 
planning heroes is what will 
bring Detroit back to its former 
glory days.

Yet, 
Detroit’s 
legacy 
of 

innovation 
is 
not 
dead; 
it 

is 
refashioning 
itself 
into 

something 
different. 
Similar 

to 
Ford’s 
industry-shaking 

assembly line, Detroit is living 
through 
a 
renaissance 
of 

innovation. Now, the Motor 
City is officially City of Design, 
at least according to UNESCO. 
Henry Ford would be proud of 
the innovators making waves 
in Detroit and modernizing the 
city for the future and beyond. 
While Detroit is no longer the 
industrial hub it once was, it 
can be a center for design and 
creativity, according to Ellie 
Schneider and DC3. Detroit can 
be restored to its status as the 
capital of industry once again, 
only instead of automotive it is 
design-motive.

out / Take strength in us, your 
people / Stay up Detroit”

OFF-WHITE

Off-White designer weds 
fashion and architecture

Virgil Abloh draws from architectural and engineering 
background in pursuit of fresh and unexpected clothing

For anyone who knows fashion, 

it’s no mystery who Virgil Abloh 
is. Though he is now the creator 
of Off-White, Abloh’s journey to 
this position was certainly less 
than linear. In college, Abloh 
studied structural engineering 
at the University of Wisconsin—
Madison before realizing his 
interest in building design. He 
then went to the Illinois Institute 
of Technology to receive his 
master’s degree in architecture. 
From there, he would soon 
become a creative director for 
Kanye 
West’s 
creative 
think 

tank, DONDA. He would go on 
to receive a Grammy nomination 
for best recording package for 
the album Watch The Throne. 
Most recently, and probably most 
notably, 
however, 
Abloh 
has 

collaborated with Nike. Called 
“The Ten,” Abloh selected ten 
popular Nike shoes and added in 
some of his own design ethos.

While 
Abloh’s 
accomplishments 

and projects are difficult to count 
and keep track of, Abloh gave a 
lecture at the Harvard University 
Graduate School of Design on 
October 
26, 
titled 
“Program 

Organization, 
Sequencing 

Experiences,” an allusion to the 
well-known branding of many 
Off-White garments. Abloh was 
introduced 
by 
Harvard 
GSA 

design critic Oana Stanescu, 
whom Abloh has worked with on 
various projects, including Kanye 
West’s Yeezus tour set design and 
Off-White’s Hong Kong flagship 
store. Stanescu describes Abloh as 
“an architect of a different scale,” 
continuing “[his] work centers 
around the core of creative 
freedom.”

Abloh spent much of the lecture 

talking about the characteristics 

that define his signature and 
how these values are manifested 
in his designs and work. These 
component pieces ranged from 
his love of ready-made art and his 
desire to insert humanity through 
conversation to his actual design 
code. He mentioned his three-
percent approach, in which he 
never edits something more than 
three-percent from its original 
form. He has other values that 
are important to him, such as the 
beauty of a work in progress or 
making sure that a design has a 
reason to exist. He points to his 
ability to know that enough is 
enough and that things don’t have 
to be perfect the first time.

In his words, the desire behind 

the lecture was not for attendees 
to see how far Abloh has come 
in his 37 years (in fact, Abloh 
attributes a lot of his success to 
dumb luck and knowing the right 
people). Instead, Abloh’s goal 
was for the audience to imagine 
themselves in his shoes and to put 
questions to themselves: What is 
your list of values? What makes 
you excited, and how can you 
make that thing happen?

Abloh also spent some time 

during the lecture talking about 
his mentors. He was quick 
to admit that he has a ton of 
mentors: old and young, dead and 
alive. During the Q&A after the 
lecture, someone asked Abloh 
about his relationship with his 
mentors who have passed. Abloh 
responded by discussing the 
value of understanding what their 
reasoning was for making certain 
design choices and how to apply 
that same rationale back into his 
own design.

From my perspective, the most 

interesting aspect of the lecture 
was the way in which Abloh was 
able to put himself in the shoes of 
the students that sat before him. 
Abloh tells his own story of how 

he was able to take a background 
of engineering and architecture 
and turn it into a career in fashion 
without entirely abandoning the 
things that he learned in school. 
That was what made it special. 
Abloh even did his best to try and 
distill what he has learned over 
the years into what he called his 
“cheat codes,” which were aimed 
to help people find their personal 
creative DNA.

Through 
this 
entire 

presentation, it became quite 
clear that Virgil Abloh is not an 
ordinary 
person. 
Sometimes, 

that manifests itself in his desire 
to constantly be innovating and 
doing cool, new things. Other 
times, it manifests itself by the 
fact that it constantly seems like 
he is doing a half-dozen things 
at once. From collaborations 
with IKEA, where he’s looking to 
design the millennial’s apartment, 
and his collaborations with Nike, 
to the constant output of designs 
for Off-White, it’s clear that Abloh 
is quick to draw inspiration from 
others and is often looking to 
push the envelope on what he’s 
allowed to do as a designer. In 
the past, I’ve considered some of 
Abloh’s designs to be uninspired, 
but learning about the thought 
process behind his designs has 
helped me learn that this isn’t 
quite the case.

Abloh said himself that he isn’t 

a big deal, even acting confused as 
to why he was at the front of the 
lecture hall giving a talk. But that 
all seemed to fade away as he was 
rushed by a mob of kids looking for 
him to sign their sneakers. Along 
with the rest of Abloh’s designs, 
these sneakers show the years 
of hard work and commitment 
to improving his own eye for 
design, incorporating things that 
he learned in the classroom along 
with things that he’s learned in 
the real world.

Spending an afternoon 
wandering the UMMA

Experiencing the University through the dichotomous 
architecture and genre-spanning works at the museum

It was a busy day at the 

University’s Museum of Art. 
Students were filing in and out 
as tour guides led their groups 
through the galleries. Visitors 
from all ages could be seen 
wandering the museum. Young 
kids on tours were running 
through the hallways trying 
to keep up with their groups, 
students were typing away at 
their computers and middle aged 
and elderly adults were walking 
freely and admiring the art. From 
my point of view, sitting at a bench 
by the gift store, I could see all of 
this, and I could see the students 
who walked past the building on 
their way to class. Some of them 
walked determinedly, with their 
gaze forward and at a quick pace. 
Most of them, however, averted 
their eyes.

The UMMA is known as Ann 

Arbor’s meeting place for the 
arts. It “contains a comprehensive 
collection that represents more 
than 150 years at the university, 
with nearly 19,000 works of 
art that span cultures, eras and 
media.” Works by artists like 
Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet 
are permanently exhibited in 
the museum galleries, but it 
also hosts around four or five 
travelling exhibitions every year. 
From ancient artifacts to modern 
paintings and digital media, 
art in all of its mediums can be 
admired in the museum. The 
space provided by the UMMA is 
unparalleled by other buildings 
on campus. There are few other 
buildings at the University that 
are versatile enough to hold such 
a wide array of events and attract 
such a diverse group of visitors.

Despite its versatility and 

prestige, 
walking 
through 

the UMMA may seem a scary 
undertaking for students and 
community members who know 
little about art. The UMMA has 
a reputation among students as 
being a place designed only for a 
specific audience. When looking 
at the building itself, it is not 
hard to imagine that art history 
majors, Stamps professors, art 
amateurs and museum experts 
are the intended consumers of 
the art inside. On one side of the 
building — the original wing — 
the neoclassical style architecture 
appears somber and heavy. On the 
other side — the new wing — the 
design is modern, sleek and has 
an airy feeling given by the wall-
sized windows. The dichotomy 
between 
these 
buildings 
is 

sometimes confusing and hard to 
decipher for visitors.

To join into the conversation 

between the two sides of the 
UMMA, 
it 
is 
important 
to 

understand the history and ideas 
behind the creation of both wings. 
On May 11, 1910, the building that 
we know as the original wing of 
the UMMA was inaugurated. 
Then known as Alumni Memorial 
Hall, this opulent building was 
the product of “a desire to honor 
those University men who had 
fallen in the Civil War.” One 
hundred years, a renovation and 
an addition later, the building 
stands tall on the corner of State 
Street and South University. With 
its four grand pillars, bronze doors 
and stone exteriors, the original 
building is a quintessential image 
of a memorial hall.

The solemn mood exhibited by 

this building can be off-putting 
to many visitors, especially when 
seen in contrast with the design 
of the new wing. Inaugurated in 
2009, the new wing of the UMMA 
was created to look and function 
as an art museum. The boxy, 
simple architecture of the new 
wing invites visitors and allows 
for art to spill from within the 
walls into the paths of passersby. 
The distinction between the two 
was not accidental or a product 
of chance. According to David 
Lawrence, the communications 
manager at the UMMA, “when 
people saw the old building they 
didn’t think art museum; they 
saw something more serious 
and 
less 
approachable.” 
The 

UMMA addition was deliberately 
designed in a more transparent, 
less somber way in an attempt to 
attract more visitors, to expand 
gallery space and to make the 
art housed in the museum more 
visible and public. In addition to 
the outdoor construction being 
designed 
in 
a 
contemporary 

and more transparent way, the 
interior of the museum, according 
to Lawrence, was “built as a 
wandering museum.”

The stark difference seen on 

the façades of these two wings 
becomes more interesting as the 
wandering journey through the 
museum starts. In the midst of 
the chitter-chatter and flows 
of people entering and exiting 
the galleries, I was getting a 
private tour. I was guided by a 
staff member, and even though 
he said that the point of entering 
the museum was to wander, I 
was taken on the correct route 
through the UMMA. We started 
at the old wing with Western 
art, and we ended at the vertical 
gallery — which displayed some 
of the University’s biggest modern 
paintings.

When we were on the highest 

floor of the vertical gallery, I 
could see the African art gallery, 
the photography gallery and the 
contemporary art gallery. Even 
though I could see most of the 
galleries displayed in the new 
wing, the path to any of these 
places wasn’t clear. My guide 
effortlessly 
cruised 
through 

and took me to every gallery 
without a problem. I was kind of 
disappointed that I did not get to 
discover the museum by myself, 
but throughout my tour I started 
picking up bits and pieces of other 
people’s experiences.

My 
guide 
was 
quickly 

divulging every fact about the 
history, design and most famous 
art pieces in the UMMA, but 
the rest of the visitors did not 
have 
this 
advantage. 
Rather 

than being promptly walked 
by a guide, most of them stood 
in front of and questioned the 
art pieces for as long as they 
wanted. I was getting all of 
the information, but they were 
getting the adventure. Quietly, 
but in a determined manner, I 
could see how each of the visitors 
I observed were carving their 
own space within the galleries. 
Some were adamantly admiring 
the photography, and others were 
interested in the Picasso pieces. 
The maze within the museum 
allowed every visitor to adventure 
and create their own personalized 
tour of the galleries, and, in that 
way, the mezzanines and four-
foot-high paintings seemed less 
intimidating.

The experience of visiting 

the UMMA cannot be described 
without talking about the design 
and 
layout 
of 
the 
building. 

Walking through the galleries 
and exploring is directly affected 
by the layout of the space. With 
the wandering museum design, 
visitors at the UMMA can take 
advantage of the secluded rooms 
and nooks to make the space their 
own and consume the art in their 
own terms.

RICHARD MEIER & PARTNERS ARCHITECTS LLP.

Pritzker-winning 
architect Richard Meier 
on the Getty Center, 
his influences and the 
beauty of white space

Encapsulating both the essence 

and importance of Richard Meier 
is a difficult task. With a career so 
decorated, buildings so illustrious 
and a personality so fascinating, I 
found myself a bit blind in trying 
to figure out where to start. But 
with a body of work that captures 
the various intersections of art, 
design and architecture rather 
masterfully, an effort in earnestly 
profiling 
Meier 
was 
worth 

undertaking.

Meier garners acclaim from 

critics, colleagues and patrons 
alike for his notable structural 
clarity, use of light and space and 
his uncompromising persistence 
for the color white. Minimal, 
bare and — by consequence — 
subtly provocative artscapes are 
a signature of Meier’s, reflected 
in works such as the Barcelona 
Museum of Contemporary Art, 
Darien, Conn.’s Smith House and 
Rome’s grand Jubilee Church 
(something Meier himself boasts 
as being the “crown jewel” of the 
Catholic 
Church’s 
millennium 

celebration).

Though a maven in the world 

of architecture, Meier not only 
fashions himself an architect, 
but an industrial designer and 
abstract artist as well. While he 
has works that have long become 
unwavering urban fixtures, one 
can also find Meier’s work in art 
galleries the world over or as 
consumer products that reflect 
his architectural philosophy in its 
svelte, elegant glory.

Though a large contingent of 

our readership may not consider 
him a household name, Meier’s 
design and architectural influences 
span 
continents, 
manifesting 

themselves both in buildings he 
himself had a hand in creating or 
in buildings tasked by the many 
architects who have taken great 
inspiration from him. Many of 
them are buildings people are 
bound to see at some point in their 
lives, regardless of their familiarity 
with Meier. Among his works, the 
Getty Center reigns as one of the 
most notable, celebrating its 20th 
anniversary later this month.

Costing $1.3 billion (a far cry 

from the original estimate of $100 
million, but a cost that was well 
within reason for J. Paul Getty’s 
posthumous 
fortune 
to 
bear), 

the collection of travertine and 
metal panel adorned buildings has 
become one of Los Angeles’s and 
the world’s most notable pieces of 
architecture.

Perched atop a hill in the 

Brentwood neighborhood of L.A., 
Meier took as audacious of an 
approach in the Center’s design as 

the project proposal itself. Utilizing 
large concrete columns, towering 
walls and a gridded layout, Meier 
fashioned 
the 
center 
through 

stylistically minimal means that 
simultaneously engender wonder 
and 
provocation. 
Among 
the 

many components Meier used to 
command the Center’s aura are 
the various avant-garde fountains 
that span the campus, meant to 
maintain a consistent level of 
peaceful white noise regardless 
of where patrons walk or sit. 
Wherever you walk, in the Getty 
or any of Meier’s other works, his 
attention to detail always glows.

Coined “the commission of the 

century,” it’s a campus that, both 
in its architectural significance 
and contribution to the world of 
fine arts, is more than worthy of 
celebration, 
especially 
twenty 

years on. The Center’s campus is 
home to seminal institutions of the 
art world (all on the virtue of the 
Getty fortune, namely the J. Paul 
Getty Museum, the J. Paul Getty 
Trust and the Getty Foundation), 
and Meier’s command over its 
construction is befitting of his 
own personal philosophies of 
architecture. 

In a phone interview with 

The 
Daily, 
Meier 
further 

illuminated upon his five decades 
of architectural inspiration and 
design.

****

With 
the 
Getty 
Center 

turning 20 soon, what are 
some memories you have when 
selected to take on the project?

What was important to me was 

considering where [the site] was, 
how it related to its surroundings, 
how 
it 
can 
contribute 
the 

environment. 
It 
was 
a 
very 

ambitious project.

Two decades on, do you 

think there was something you 
would have done differently in 
designing the Getty?

Oh, no.
I can’t say I blame you. The 

Getty is a favorite of mine.

Truth be told, there probably 

has to be, but I honestly can’t think 
of anything at the moment!

I think in the way the buildings 

relate to one another, the way people 
move — from inside to outside — 
works very well. I think there’s a 
lot of communication there, among 
the staff and the patrons, and I’ve 
had so many people come up to me 
that have visited the Getty who’ve 
said, “You know, I spent the whole 
day there but I didn’t have time to 
go into the museum.” So, it’s a place 
to walk around and see things, and 
hopefully meet friends and have 
a bit of lunch and a place to just 
generally enjoy the environment. I 
think we succeeded in making such 

a space.

On that note, speaking to your 

work as a whole, what are some 
important considerations for 
you when tasked with designing 
a building?

Well, I think the most important 

thing is beginning with a program. 
Someone comes to you and tells 
you what their expectation is in 
terms of what they envision — be it 
a residential building, commercial, 
a museum. But all that being said, 
it’s the context that matters most, 
really. What the building is, how it 
relates to what’s around it, how it 
can have arms — so to speak — that 
reach out and improve the existing 
context of the area.

Specifically with art spaces 

— with you having designed 
multiple museums — are there 
particular 
components 
you 

consider integral in designing 
such spaces?

Oh, absolutely. Light is, of 

course, paramount. The quality 
of light, the way you see things in 
natural light. One doesn’t really 
aim to design a black box, so to 
speak. You want something that 
can have a relationship with 
interior and exterior space, and 
that generally holds true for any 
building, but most definitely for an 
art gallery as well.

When 
designing 
such 

buildings, what’s your process in 
generating ideas?

I look carefully at the program, 

the environment, the context, 
and try to think about how people 
will use it, move through it and 
internalize it.

Do 
you 
have 
specific 

architects you draw particular 
influence from?

There are so many, to be 

honest, people I admire, historic 
and contemporary. Brunelleschi, 
Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis 
Kahn. There are a lot of great, great 
architects in the past, but that also 
doesn’t change the fact that there a 
lot of great people working today, 
too.

On 
the 
note 
of 
such 

contemporary architects, recent 
pop 
culture 
has 
seemingly 

taken a liking to architecture 
— 
Kogonada’s 
recent 
film 

“Columbus” comes to mind, 
highlighting 
Eero 
Saarinen’s 

work in Columbus, Ind. What are 
your thoughts on architecture 
becoming 
better 
embedded 

within popular culture?

What it really means is that 

now people are much more aware 
of architecture, and much more 
aware of their environment today. 
They’re 
interested 
in 
seeing 

things, simply put. As people travel 
more nowadays, it holds true. 
They look at things. They look at 
architecture. They’re interested 
in seeing different places, how 

their architecture in that place is 
different than another place, and 
what that could mean. It indicates 
greater awareness.

As an abstract artist yourself, 

do you find being an architect 
in a similar light as being a 
conventional “artist”?

I do paint, and I do collages quite 

often. I would consider myself an 
artist.

But in regards to architecture, 

do your experiences in both 
domains affect your thinking as 
an architect? Or as an artist?

No, not at all. Actually, they’re 

completely separate to me. When 
I’m doing architecture, I’m doing 
architecture. When I’m doing 
works of art, considerations get 
more abstract. Personally, there 
is no correlation — I don’t think at 
least. Someone else may find some, 
as critics do, but I wouldn’t say 
there is.

Would you say you have a sort 

of cognisant philosophy when it 
comes to your architecture?

Oh, yes. Definitely.
How would you describe it?
As an architect, you are creating 

space, space people will be moving 
through, space people will live 
in. I think about the quality of 
meaning of such space on people. 
How natural aspects such as light 
come into the space, enlivens the 
space and what meaning can be 
drawn from that. With all the 
factors that come with thinking 
about architecture, one’s approach 
to creation is quite different than 
what you may think about when 
making a painting. One requires 
less self-indulgence than the other.

With a lot of your work, the 

color white is a persistent theme, 

and I’m a personal fan of its use. 
What draws you to it? What does 
it mean to you?

White reflects color, refracts 

color, allows you to see the 
relationship between that which 
is natural and that which is man-
made. It heightens your perception 
of all the actual color, and beauty, 
that surrounds you.

Were there any works that 

were particular challenges for 
you?

Funnily enough, the Getty. 

There was a lot to consider in 
making it. There is nothing like it.

What are your plans for the 

coming years in terms of projects 
(if you can divulge that)?

Hah, I wish I knew that.
Is the business of architecture 

more short-term, or not terribly 
easy to predict?

We’re very busy today, which 

we’re very fortunate for. But a year 
from now, who knows?
