PING PONG R ALLIES ON

Problems reported 
in several areas of 
Central Campus

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

Just in time for the first day 

of 
class, 
University 
wireless 

networks decided not to make an 
appearance on Central Campus 
Tuesday.

Andy Palms, the executive 

director 
of 
communications 

systems and data centers, said 
the Wi-Fi problems — which 
began at 10 a.m. Tuesday with the 
MWireless, MGuest and eduroam 
networks all struggling to connect 
— should be resolved by early 
Wednesday morning. 

“It 
does 
not 
impact 
the 

Health System,” Palms said in 
an interview Tuesday about the 
intermittent service. “It does 
not impact the South Campus. 

It also does not impact most of 
North Campus. It’s pretty much a 
Central Campus issue.”

Tuesday’s 
problems, 
Palms 

explained, arose from a bug in the 
Wi-Fi vendor’s code as a result of 
heavy wireless use across campus.

“Today, 
by 
changing 

configuration and spreading the 
load out across more equipment, 
we decreased the impact of the 
bug,” Palms wrote.

Earlier, Palms had noted that 

the University upgraded roughly 

3,000 of its wireless access points 
over the summer. Doing so, he 
said, was part of accommodating 
a yearly increase in network use. 
This year’s Wi-Fi use rose by 20 
percent from last year, a change 
that Palms said is “well within our 
specs.”

During 
the 
day

University’s

University to hire 

35 new faculty 
members over 
next four years

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will invest 

$100 million in a new Data 
Science Initiative over the 
next five years with the aim 
of enhancing learning and 
research 
opportunities 
for 

students and faculty members.

To support the initiative, 

the University will hire 35 
new faculty members over the 
next four years and launch 
the Michigan Institute for 
Data Science, which will lead 
educational 
and 
research 

opportunities related to big 
data. Massive sets of data can 
help researchers produce new 
insights into a broad spectrum 
of topics, from learning and 
medicine to transportation and 

social media.

“Big 
data 
can 
provide 

dramatic insights into the 
nature 
of 
disease, 
climate 

change, 
social 
behavior, 

business 
and 
economics, 

engineering, and the basic 
biological 
and 
physical 

sciences,” University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
wrote 
in 

a 
statement. 
“With 
our 

widely recognized strengths 
across all of these areas and 
our 
longstanding 
culture 

of 
collaboration 
across 

disciplines, U-M is in a unique 
position 
to 
leverage 
this 

investment in data science for 
the good of society.”

The initiative also aims 

to expand the University’s 
computing capacity, support 
interdisciplinary 
research 

on 
big 
data 
and 
provide 

opportunities 
for 
students 

interested in careers related to 
data science.

Representatives to 
propose resolution 
for undocumented 

student aid

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

At 
Central 
Student 

Government’s inaugural meeting 
of the school year Tuesday, 
representatives 
discussed 

priorities for the school year 
and confirmed nominations for 
executive positions.

Priorities

CSG President Cooper Charlton, 

an LSA senior, said his first 
priority is to ensure the student 
body understands the University’s 
Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities.

The statement — which details 

expectations for student conduct 
and outlines suggested sanctions 
and disciplinary measures for 
violations — is due for revision 
this year. Students can suggest 
changes to the statement by the 
beginning of November, and for 
that reason, Charlton said it’s 

imperative students understand 
the document.

Charlton 
also 
discussed 

drinking 
culture 
on 
campus, 

particularly the University’s new 
efforts to curb alcohol abuse.

Whether they agree with the 

new plans or not, he said CSG 
representatives are in a good 
position to voice their opinions on 
the subject. The University’s new 
initiatives include plans to notify 
the parents of first-year students 
after they incur a second violation, 
as well as an effort to expand 
the presence of the University of 
Michigan Police Department off 
campus.

“Welcome 
Week, 
I’m 
sure 

everyone had fun, but there’s 
definitely a line and we all know 
what it is,” Charlton said.

CSG Vice President Steven 

Halperin, an LSA junior, also 
discussed CSG’s plans to approach 
sexual assault, citing a new 
program instituted in Greek life for 
incoming freshmen pledges.

Each incoming student vying 

for a position in a sorority or 
fraternity will be subject to a 
mandatory meeting about sexual 
assault prevention, Halperin said.

Schlissel discusses 

new initiatives

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

After a year of calls for 

increased campus diversity, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said he expects to see 
signs of tangible improvement 
as early as this September.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily last week, 
Schlissel said he hopes this 
year’s freshman enrollment 
figures — typically released 
in the fall — will reflect the 
impacts of a new University 
effort to package the delivery 
of financial aid awards and 
admissions decisions.

updates likely

consent definition

By SAM GRINGLAS

Managing News Editor

University President Mark 

Schlissel told The Michigan 
Daily he hopes to update the 

University’s Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy “before the 
new year.”

“The goal of making change 

is to have the process be as fair 
as possible to the complainant 
and the respondent to help us 
arrive at a decision which is 
the right one,” he said in an 
interview.

Schlissel 
previously 

discussed 
the 
University’s 

intentions to consider changes 
to the policy at a fireside 

chat in April. The policy was 
last revised in 2013, when 
it was updated based on a 
set 
of 
recommendations 

handed down by the U.S. 
Department 
of 
Education. 

The updated version changed 
the burden of proof applied 
when 
adjudicating 
sexual 

misconduct 
cases. 
Now, 

decisions

“Somebody 
may 
not 
even 

get access, but if they try again 
after a few minutes, they will,” 
Palms said, later adding that the 
intermittency could result in 
networks “dumping (connected 
students) off after a few minutes.”

LSA junior Elizabeth Brennen 

said the wireless was down for 
most of the two hours she spent in 
Mason Hall Tuesday afternoon. 

“I was trying to pull up the 

syllabus before class and review it, 
and I couldn’t, so it was a bummer 
to not have Internet,” she said. 
“I would say internet is almost 
fundamental 
to 
my 
learning 

experience at this point.”

assault awareness commission is 
also under consideration.

“Something that we really want 

this commission to focus on is 
something that is very surprising to 
me that the student survey unveiled 
— that 21 percent of sexual assault 
occurs 
from 
verbal 
pressure,” 

Halperin said.

Proposal 
for 
undocumented 

student aid

Representatives also announced a 

future resolution to provide legal aid 
and scholarships to undocumented 
students at the University.

Lamin Manneh, a Rackham 

student representative, said the 
issue deeply affects the University 
population, which he said has a 
significant immigrant population.

“Among 
these 
groups 
of 

immigrants, 
there’s 
a 
lot 
of 

undocumented migrants,” he said. 
“Our friends, our classmates.”

In 2013, the University’s Board 

of Regents voted to grant in-state 
tuition 
fees 
to 
undocumented 

students. The decision followed 

a multi-year student movement 
calling for the change.

Manneh said the University 

has a hostile relationship with its 
undocumented students, and their 
inability to receive aid limits their 
upward mobility.

“The University has to be pushed 

to even consider that immigrant 
students need financial aid,” Manneh 
said. “They cannot recognize it 
without 
student 
movement 
to 

maintain that pressure.”

Manneh said that the University 

should follow in the steps of the 
University of California, Berkeley, 
which provides free legal aid 
and assistance with legal fees 
for 
undocumented 
immigrants 

applying for national work permits.

Elections

Officers 
of 
the 
Executive 

Committee were also elected during 
Tuesday’s meeting.

LSA 
junior 
Sean 
Pitt 
was 

confirmed as CSG chief of staff in 
a unanimous vote. Business senior 
Kevin Ziegler was elected treasurer. 
Public Policy sophomore Jacob 
Pearlman was unanimously elected 
chief of Student General Counsel.

MSU most dangerous campus

Citing statistics from the 

U.S. Department of Education’s 
Office of Postsecondary Educa-
tion, the website Crime Watch 
Daily ranked Michigan State 
University as the most danger-
ous college campus in the coun-
try, the State News reported.

Using data from 2013, Crime 

Watch reported four cases 
of 
agggravated 
assault, 
62 

motor vehicle thefts, 27 sexual 
assaults, 120 burglaries, nine 
cases of arson and four robber-
ies. 

A note posted on the Office 

of Postsecondary Education’s 
website noted that not all 
reported cases have been pros-
ecuted. 

“The 
crime 
statistics 

found on this website rep-
resent 
alleged 
criminal 

offenses reported to campus 
security 
authorities 
and/or 

local law enforcement agen-
cies,” the note said. “Therefore, 
the data collected do not neces-
sarily reflect prosecutions or 
convictions for crimes.”

Pope’s visit

A More than 1,000 students, 

faculty members and staff are 
expected to sign up for a walk 
from 
St. 
Agatha-St. 
James 

Church to the papal mass on 
the Benjamin Franklin Park-
way, The Daily Pennsylvanian 

reported. 

Additionally, 240 students 

are signed up through the Penn 
Catholic 
Students 
Associa-

tion to volunteer for the World 
Meeting of Families, a nonprof-
it that ensures the success of

T-shirts reading “Penn for 

Pope” and “Pope is Dope” are 
on sale for students to promote 
the visit.

Andrea Muglia, a senior at

dents from all over campus to

Welcome Week events returned

New location held 
free weekend classes 
to celebrate grand 

opening

By AMABEL KAROUB

Daily News Editor

No longer will students have to 

twist themselves into a knot to find a 
yoga studio on South University.

aUM Yoga opened a new studio 

at South Forest Street and South 
University Avenue, above Bubble 
Island Coffee and Tea. Throughout 
Labor Day weekend, the studio 
offered more than 20 free yoga 
classes and, as of Sunday afternoon, 
more 
than 
750 
students 
had 

attended class since the promotion 
started on Friday.

University alum Jessie Lipkowitz, 

the owner of aUM, opened the 
studio’s first location at 715 North 
University Ave. in September 2013. 

Now, with the addition of a new 
location, 
the 
North 
University 

studio will exclusively house yoga 
instructor training and meetings for 
the Michigan Yoga Club. Lipkowitz 
said the space will also be available 
to rent out for private events.

Lipkowitz, who earned a Bachelor 

of Arts from the University in 2011, said 
the South University studio will be 
more convenient for undergraduates 
because residences have become 
more condensed in that area over 
the past few years, particularly with 
the addition of several new high rise 
apartment buildings.

“With all of the sororities being 

in the Washtenaw area, and with 
Arbor Blu, Zaragon (West) and 
(University) Towers and all of that, 
it’s going to be very convenient,” 
Lipkowitz said. “I think it’s an 
exciting place to be.”

The new aUM is the only yoga 

studio near South Campus. Other 
popular yoga studios near campus — 
including Center for Yoga, Detroit Yoga 
and aUM’s North University Avenue 
location — are condensed near the 
South State Street business district.

Business junior Jordan Davis, 

founder of the Michigan Yoga Club, 
said it is in a prime location on 
campus. Though the Yoga Club will 
hold sessions at the original aUM 
location, many of its members will 
also likely frequent the new studio.

“It’s in the nexus of campus,” 

Davis said. “It’s an even better 
location just because of the foot 
traffic for kids walking on South U 
every day as compared to North U.”

Davis said when he asked aUM 

to partner with the club about two 
years ago, Lipkowitz jumped on 

the opportunity. aUM hosts and 
instructs all of the Michigan Yoga 
Club’s classes.

The new second-floor studio 

features two large yoga rooms — 
one with a floor-to-ceiling window 
— and a reception area. Davis said 
every class has been at capacity.

“It’s by far the nicest yoga studio 

on this campus,” Davis said. “I’ve 
been there all weekend, all the 
classes have been filled and it’s 
really cool to see.”

A huge aim of aUM, Lipkowitz 

said, is to create a sense of 
community and fun. She said she 
hopes to demystify yoga, in part 
through the studio’s approachable 
instructors and funky class names.

“Just coming up with things that 

are out of the box makes yoga more 
relatable to people,” she said.

Class names include: “F*** This 

is Hard,” “All Yin, No Yang” and 
“Damn! This is Sexy and Slow.”

“I’m a little flamboyant in my 

ideas,” Lipkowitz said. “I don’t 
necessarily have a filter.”

Davis said aUM has played a 

pivotal role in facilitating a strong 
community of yogis across campus. 
He said aUM’s instructors are 
the most attentive of any he has 
experienced in Ann Arbor and that 
he feels a sense of belonging when 
he is at the studio.

“I walk in the door and really 

feel like I’m part of an amazing 
community,” he said. “You get a lot 
out of aUM because you get that 
sense of community, and belong 
to something that’s a great place 
to meet other really cool students 
of all different ages, all different 
backgrounds.”

modest incremental changes in 
the direction of diversity now,” 
he said. “We began implementing 
some of the changes in the 
admissions and financial aid 
procedure a year ago, and in 
September we are going to 
announce how we did.”

The initiative largely focused on 

closing the gap between the receipt 
of financial aid packages and 
admissions decisions, with the goal 
of helping families and students as 
they make decisions about college, 
particularly the costs.

Schlissel said he expects the 

makeup of this year’s freshman 
class to reflect the impacts of 
this change.

The president has frequently 

spoken of plans to release a 
campus-wide diversity initiative. 
He told the Daily on Tuesday that 
he expects to launch the full plan 
by the end of the academic year 
— not at his summit on diversity 

scheduled for next week.

That event will instead focus 

on laying out the broader charge 
for the initiative.

In his inaugural address last 

September, 
Schlissel 
deemed 

diversity and inclusion a priority 
of his presidency. In the address, 
Schlissel 
said 
excellence 
is 

rooted in a diverse and inclusive 
student body.

Despite 
ongoing 
calls 
for 

a more diverse campus, both 
by students and by University 
officials, 
the 
University 
has 

struggled 
to 
increase 
the 

diversity of its staff and student 
body, as well as address issues 
related to campus climate. In 
2014, Black students made up 
4.63 percent of the student body, 
compared to the state’s Black 
community, 
which 
composes 

14.3 percent of the population. In 
Fall 2011, 63 percent of incoming 
freshmen 
reported 
family 

incomes over $100,000.

Last 
week, 
Schlissel 
also 

announced a new effort to 
increase 
the 
student 
body’s 

socioeconomic 
diversity. 
The 

High Achieving Involved Leader 
scholarship will cover four years 
of tuition for a select group of 
in-state, low-income students 
and provide additional resources 
during the application process.

Fitzgerald 
said 
application 

support and college planning 
resources will be offered to 1,000 
students through the program 
this year.

He said it’s too early to tell 

how many of those students will 
ultimately receive scholarship 
money, though all of those 
admitted from the pilot’s pool 
will receive the funds.

Though optimistic, Schlissel 

stressed achieving a diverse 
student body will not happen 
quickly. He said his university-
wide strategic plan will continue 
on after his presidency ends.

“I am convinced my successors 

are going to be working on this 
because of how far society has 
to go to be truly inclusive and 
diverse society, the kind that 
matches our ideals.”

likely to have occured than not.

Tuesday, Schlissel said the 

Office of Student Life will spend 
the semester working with 
Central Student Government 
to garner additional feedback 
on the policy. Those forums 
will begin Oct. 1, according to 
University Spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald.

In 
April, 
Schlissel 
said 

changes would likely focus on 
the timeline of the adjudication 
process and issues, as well as 
improving University resources 
provided to students during and 
after the process.

“One thing, in particular, 

we’re concerned about is there 
are issues of representation 
during the process,” he added 
during the chat.

However, 
Schlissel 
said 

Tuesday he doesn’t anticipate 
changes 
to 
the 
policy’s 

definition of consent.

An April report by Daily 

raised 
questions 
about 
the 

difference between language 
in 
the 
University’s 
official 

policy, which defines consent 
as “clear and unambiguous 
agreement, 
expressed 
in 

mutually 
understandable 

words or actions,” and wording 
in 
educational 
materials 

provided by the University’s 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center.

SAPAC’s 
more 
stringent 

language identifies consent as 
an explicitly verbal agreement, 
not satisfied by silence or body 
language.

SAPAC Director Holly Rider-

Milkovich 
later 
announced 

plans 
to 
clarify 
language 

around consent on its website 
and in educational materials.

“At the end of the day, we can 

have really tight definitions, 

but we’re still left with an 
interaction that occurs with 
the door closed between two 
adults,” Schlissel said. “So who’s 
version of what happened forms 
the basis for moving forward? I 
think it is important to discuss 
consent mainly so students can 
really understand one another 
when they are in a room with 
the door closed, but I’m not 100 
percent confident that’s going 
to end up affecting in a very 
dramatic way the adjudication 
process.”

Still, Schlissel said he’s open 

to the discussion, and will watch 
the impacts of laws in other 
states, like California, that have 
enacted 
legislation 
defining 

consent in the affirmative.

“Lack of protest or resistance 

does not mean consent, nor 
does silence mean consent,” 
California’s 
2014 
definition 

states. 
“Affirmative 
consent 

must be ongoing throughout 
a sexual activity and can be 
revoked at any time.”

“The states that are pushing 

hard on this will be our 
laboratories, right?” Schlissel 
said. “If California all of sudden 
had a huge drop in sexual 
assault and misconduct, then 
oh boy, I’m ready to do that too.”

Schlissel 
said 
there 
are 

other benefits to discussing 
the University’s definition of 
consent, even if it doesn’t lead 
to a change in the official policy.

“We like to think there’s an 

objective reality out there in the 
world, and as a scientist, I cling 
to this idea that there’s truth out 
there, and you know, I’m going 
to discover it,” he said. “It turns 
out from the moment you set 
your eyes on a situation, you’re 
interpreting it differently than 
I am. And I think a discussion 
about consent will help all of us 
understand what one another 
are thinking so we can treat one 
another more respectfully.”

They 
said 
multidisciplinary 

institutions like the University 
fuel researching by using data 
from very different domains. 
Discoveries in archeology, Hero 
said, are driven not only by findings 
by archaeologists at dig sites, 
but also by archived historical 
data and language processing 
machines. The big data MIDAS is 
concerned with analyzing, Hero 
and Athey said, has to do with its 
variety and velocity.

“The idea about big data is not 

just about the volume or the size 
or how many bytes it is,” Athey 

said. “(It’s about) how complex 
and diverse the data is. It’s about 
variety … velocity. How fast is it 
growing? We anticipate there 
could be terabytes streaming in a 
minute. It could be that fast.”

The DSI will focus on collecting 

and using big data to strengthen 
transportation research, health 
sciences, learning analytics and 
social science research.

“Big data is revolutionizing 

research 
in 
extraordinary 

range of disciplines,” S. Jack 
Hu, interim vice president for 
research, wrote in a statement. 
“With 
this 
initiative, 
our 

goal is to spark innovation in 
research across campus while 
inspiring further advances in the 
techniques of data science itself.”

Using patient visits, medical 

histories and DNA sequences, for 
example, researchers can access 

an individual’s risk for certain 
types of cancer.

The University also hopes to 

use student data to customize 
teaching 
to 
the 
needs 
of 

individual students.

Data security will be an 

important part of the DSI, Hero 
said.

“There is a classic paradigm 

between 
data 
security 
and 

data privacy,” Hero said. “That 
paradigm really starts to break 
down with big data. Despite all of 
your efforts to protect your own 
personal data, it can be eventually 
used to triangulate down to 
geography and, in some cases, 
identity can be compromised. 
Privacy 
means 
more 
than 

just protection of your data 
by the standard identification 
techniques. It means you have to 
develop new methods.”

State rep. admits to 
misuse of resources

State Rep. Cindy Gamrat (R–

Plainwell) admitted to misuse 
of public funds and misconduct 
Tuesday 
during 
a 
committee 

hearing stemming from attempts 
to cover up an affair between 
herself and fellow state Rep. 
Todd Courser (R–Lapeer), The 
Detroit 
News 
reported. 
The 

House Business Office released 
a report last week alleging that 
both Courser and Gamrat misued 
resources in the process of covering 
up their affair. The committee is 
considering several disciplinary 
options for both representatives 
including expulsion from the state 
House. 

Detroit councilman 
drafting ordinance 
for dispensaries

James Tate, a Detroit city 

councilmember, has been working 
to create an ordinance that would 
regulate marijuana dispensaries 
in the city, The Detroit Free Press 
reported. The ordinance may be 
implemented by next week. 

The ordinance would dictate 

where the dispensaries could be 
located relative to schools, parks 
and churches in the area, and 
likely require dispensaries to gain 
a city license to operate.

Existing dispensaries will not 

be grandfathered out of the new 
requirements, Tate said.

Frita’s voted best 
burgers in country

Local restaurant Frita Batidos 

was rated as having one of the best

USA Today. The article referred 
to the Cuban restaurant as “a col-
lege-town favorite.” 

The winning burger, chorizo 

with a soft egg bun, can have add-
ons including egg and avocado.

I

was alone in the aisle, looking at Camel-
bak and Nalgene plastic, where I could 
not hide that I had a problem. My mom, 

sister and I were scoping 
out Target before leaving 
for school. I needed a new 
water bottle and my sister 
wanted a bigger pot for her 
plant. The discussion in my head was so loud 
I didn’t hear when my mom entered the aisle, 
finding me crouched, examining the flip-top 
lid of my predator, my brain in the fetal posi-
tion.

“I don’t know … I just don’t know.”
I don’t remember exactly when it started or 

what it stemmed from. If I had to guess, I would 
say a fear of failing, the future or the butterfly 
effect; I’m dramatic that way. Whatever the 
cause, I had developed a behavior that fogged 
my brain: I was indecisive.

Indecisiveness 
can 
be 
a 
destructive 

behavior if extreme, quite simply because it 
stops decisions from being made.

All my life, I’ve made choices slowly and 

deliberately. No pros and cons lists, but it took 
time. After getting my college acceptance 
letters, I became even slower. Never before 
had a choice held this much importance. I 
fell into a haze. If any one decision could be 
this important, every other decision I made 
could no longer be taken lightly. I clung to 
every option I was presented like a child in a 
grocery store clinging to a stranger that looks 
like his or her mother.

Which brings me back to Target. I had it in 

my head that a portable container held the key 
to having a good college year — a good future. 
With a bottle in each hand, I questioned: Did I 
want my future to be 20 or 32 oz.?

“Payton, you’ve been here half an hour.”
I tire my mother. I grabbed the first one I 

saw and walked away, though I was tempted 
to return with each step. 

Problems only get bigger, choices more 

important. My palms sweat a little bit just 
thinking about it. The priority, however, 
needs to be getting rid of this incessant 
deliberation when extreme. I, for instance, 
can no longer decide what to do with my 
arms when I sleep. While the behavior itself 
isn’t always threatening, indecisiveness is a 
symptom of many mental illnesses, including 
depression and anxiety disorder. In addition, 
if you can never make a choice, life will never 
go anywhere.

However, there are some ways in which 

you can help yourself (ways only previously 
tested by me).

First, do not believe in the butterfly effect. 

What I have for dinner tonight is unlikely to 
affect the grades of my Spanish class. Second, 
take the time to remember this, but don’t 
take the time to make simple decisions. If you 
finish shampoo, run into the store, grab any 
bottle and run to the cashier. Test yourself. 
Third, on the bigger choices, be patient with 
yourself. Acknowledge when a decision 
is bigger than most, but be proactive. For 
example, declaring a major is imperative, but 
also a decision big enough to spend time on. 
Finally, give yourself wiggle room. If there 
are no choices that are entirely appealing, 
make your own. Consider a double major, 
because the next best thing to not choosing 
is choosing two.

I 

love my body. I really do.

Yes, 
in 
this 
moment, 

my body is awesome, and 

impressive (how do I still look like 
this after eating 
so much Chipotle 
and 
chocolate?), 

and it’s nothing 
to be ashamed of. 
Yet maybe a few words caught your 
attention in that last sentence: “In 
this moment.”

The thing is, there’s a catch here, 

and I’m only beginning to realize 
why. Yes, I love my body. But I only 
love my body when it reminds me of 
someone else’s. I only love my body 
when I feel like the resemblance 
is strong enough between me and 
whichever flawless woman is on 
the cover of this month’s flawless 
woman-covered 
magazine. 
I 

only love my body when I catch a 
glimpse in the mirror and see clear 
skin and straight hair, rather than 
a community of pimples staking 
claim to my chin, or a ‘do that’s 
somewhere 
between 
not-quite-

straight-but-definitely-not-wavy 
and “do you ever brush your hair?” 
(Honestly, not that often.)

I only love my body when I 

feel like it’s close enough to what 
beautiful is advertised to be. When 
I feel like my stomach could pass 
as not big and my boobs could pass 
as not small. When my legs aren’t 
too purple and blotchy today, and 
my face not too red today, and my 
stretch marks not so angry today — 
and I say today because tomorrow 
might be different. 

Tomorrow, wearing a bathing 

suit might be the bravest thing I’ve 
done all day. Tomorrow, I might feel 
like crawling out of my skin and into 
someone else’s, please. Tomorrow, 
my whole being might feel like an 
eyesore because another purple 
stretch mark has crawled up my 
hips (apparently it took my body 21 
years to realize it was a woman, and 

it decided to catch up really fast on 
the hip front), or because another 
half-centimeter has settled into 
my waist, or another pimple has 
decided to show up on my stomach. 
(Seriously, who gets pimples on 
their stomach? Me. I do.)

I only love my body when I feel 

like it’s worthy of someone else’s 
eyes. When I look like something 
someone else might think looks 
nice. Especially when someone 
compliments my body.

Sometimes I look in the mirror 

and think, “Wow, I’m not so bad,” 
like this recurring revelation. I think 
sometimes I’m so hard on my body 
that when I actually see it, I’m blown 
away by how incredibly not terrible 
it is. Because in that moment, maybe 
I almost fit the standard.

You see, the problem is not that 

I don’t love my body; the problem 
is all of the reasons that I do. 
Sometimes. Not because it’s my body, 
my permanent home, my pretty 
normal-looking human self that has 
carried me through my entire life 
and deserves a whole lot of love for 
that. Not because I have reached 
the enviable level of self-acceptance 
where I have come to the realization 
that I’m stuck in my body forever, and 
I better love it or I’ll just be miserable 
my whole life. Not because it looks 
like my body, Rachael Lacey’s body. 
But because it looks close enough to 
someone else’s.

I saw an ad the other day that 

read, “You’re only as young as your 
neck.” It was for lotion. And to me, 
it felt like a victory. In my mind, I 
saw women reading those words 
and realizing for the first time in 
their lives that their necks were not 
perfect — just as I have previously 
been told by ads that every single 
part of my body needs some lotion 
or gel or spray or food or haircut 
or article of clothing or five-pound 
dumbbell workout to reach its full, 
perfect potential that it is obviously 

not at right now.

But I saw this ad and I laughed. 

Because for the first time, instead 
of seeing another reason I’m not 
beautiful, I saw a page of desperate, 
neck-shaming bullshit, trying to 
capitalize on peoples’ insecurities. 
It’s almost as if they simply ran out 
of other body parts to criticize. And 
I will not let neck lotion-makers 
rule my body. I will not let their “48 
Ways To Make Your Summer Bod 
Feel Sub-Par” get me down. I will 
pick up the forgotten love for my 
body that I’ve been leaving behind 
since nine-year-old me mused that 
if she had three wishes from a 
genie, one of them would be to have 
smaller thighs. (Thank goodness 
I’ve realized by now that my thighs 
are awesome and strong and full 
of stretch marks because they’re 
so strong. Yes, my thighs are my 
favorite part of my body and I will 
let everyone know.)

Because even though saying I 

love my body feels like a lie half of 
the time, it’s slowly becoming more 
and more true. I think realizing 
why my body love has been such 
a roller-coaster ride has been the 
first step toward figuring out how 
to make that love stick around for 
good. My body deserves a better 
kind of love than the conditional 
“approval” I’ve been giving it — no 
matter how close to or far from the 
standard it is. Honestly, there are 
more important things to worry 
about in life than pimples and 
stretch marks, and I know that I 
don’t judge other people for these 
things, so why am I judging myself?

I’m taking the noose from around 

my young, lotion-less neck, so my 
voice can say, out loud, to the mirror: 
I love you. So I can say those words 
until they are just like my body: 
perfectly and beautifully mine.

ADAM MORTON | VIEWPOINT

When you see the title of this arti-

cle, what goes through your mind? 
A root-beer kegger? Pizza party? 
Rousing tournament of Monopoly 
with a few games of Uno on the side? 
Chances are, you’re picturing a well-
lit room with several mild-mannered 
conversations going around, maybe 
interrupted by the occasional neck-
bearded kid yelling “YAHTZEE!”

This interjection, of course, is met 

with a few phrases like, “Gosh darnit, 
Derick,” and “Well I guess we know 
who’s closest to Jesus today!” Cer-
tainly, this would seem like a pleas-
ant time (for your grandma) and you 
might even stay for a minute or two, 
but it’s probably not a party you’d 
walk across campus for. Heck, you 
might not even walk across the street 
for it.

There’s nothing wrong with root-

beer keggers or pizza parties, and 
there’s certainly nothing wrong with 
conversations or neck beards. (Actu-
ally, yes, there is something very 
wrong with neck beards, but you 
get my point.) Of all the things you 
thought of, there’s nothing wrong 
with them; they’re just not the reason 
you go to parties.

You go to parties for the social 

interaction. You go to parties to for-
get the things that drag you down 
the rest of the week. You go to par-
ties because, let’s face it, you’ve got 
some pretty sick moves and the 
world needs to see them. There 
are a million reasons to go to par-

ties and, in your mind, a Christian 
frat might only satisfy about two of 
those reasons.

Let me introduce you to BYX — 

Beta Upsilon Chi. We’re in a new 
house and we’re having a party.

But not just any party. A party 

would be one night and you’re done. 
I’m talking more of a festival, a 
multi-night event. Day one, we’re 
having a barbeque, because who 
doesn’t like free food? Day two, 
we’re having a block party, because 
who doesn’t like using their bizarre 
lawn-game talents to win free priz-
es? And day three, we’re having a 
rave, because who doesn’t like a 
hangover-free (yet still crazy) time 
to end Syllabus Week?

Look back at that last sentence and 

read what’s in parenthesis. “Yet still 
crazy.” You don’t believe that, do you?

Let me paint this picture:
You walk up to the BYX House, 

407 North Ingalls, and quickly notice 
there’s no line. “Maybe this isn’t peak 
time? Or maybe they’re terrible at 
advertising?” You decide it took a 
couple minutes to get here, so you 
might as well take a gander inside.

The first thing you notice: the 

brothers at the front door are wel-
coming everyone in and thanking 
them for coming. You’re not too sur-
prised by this, given your pleasant 
demeanor, golden personality and 
how your squad is absolutely killing 
the game tonight, but the greatness of 
a party isn’t defined by its front door, 

so you quickly move on. There aren’t 
many people in the common area, so 
you go downstairs to see what this 
Christian frat party is really like.

In a shocking blow to your expec-

tations, this party isn’t happening 
in a well-lit room at all; the room is 
only decently lit, with crazy lights like 
you’ve seen at other parties. Remem-
ber Yahtzee-playing Derick from 
your expectations? As it turns out, 
he’s actually a masterful DJ with 
tracks that light the whole house on 
fire. Confirming an expectation, you 
notice there are a few conversations 
happening, but it’s tough to hear 
them over the noise of a crowd abso-
lutely losing its mind. Looking at this 
party purely for what it is. It’s a lot 
like other parties; there’s just a dis-
tinct lack of smashed windows and 
smashed human beings.

For those in BYX and for the hun-

dreds who have experienced their 
parties before, this is the kind of 
night that’s filled with great memo-
ries and great people. For everyone 
else, you’re more than welcome to 
join in and find out for yourselves. 
Either way, you’ll never truly know 
what it’s like until you party with a 
Christian frat.

to everyone and will be taking place 

Sept. 10-12, with details available

Party with a Christian frat

Y

oung Americans love their celebri-
ties like they love apple pie, Uber and 
iPods. I say this fondly, as I’m mildly 

obsessed with a fairly exten-
sive list of celebrities (Ice T is 
in a screamo band, and it’s so 
good, ya’ll).

We 
have 
less 
of 
a 

relationship with and knowledge of our health 
and health care. This is partly because of a 
myriad of complex philosophical, economic and 
socio-political factors that I will spare you the 
details of, and partly because of a PR problem. 
Every 20-something is vaguely aware of the 
impact of “Obamacare” because it grants them 
the ability to stay on their parents’ (probably 
much better) insurance plan for just a tiny bit 
longer. (If you’re one of the 20-somethings who 
wasn’t aware, go to HealthCare.gov and study 
up.) But if you’re unaware, I don’t blame you. 
The PR for Obamacare wasn’t exactly positive 
or straightforward. The name of the legislation 
isn’t even “Obamacare” — it’s the Affordable 
Care Act.

You’ve 
probably 
heard 
about 
Kanye’s 

promise to Matt Neal, a 26-year-old Ann Arbor 
resident and Yeezy fan, to give him a new pair 
of Yeezy shoes if Neal successfully trades his 
own pair for a kidney. And while this has raised 
Neal’s profile in his search for a kidney donor, 
it’s also a campaign in misinformation.

Kanye would have done himself and all of us 

a favor if he’d also sold a pair of the $16 million 
sneakers and then donated the money to the 
National Kidney Foundation. He would have 
discovered that one in 10 Americans suffer 
from some level of kidney failure, and that 
the average wait time on a kidney transplant 
list is three to five years. Yeezus could have 
started a campaign about organ and human 
trafficking. If he had gotten involved in any 
of these things he would have learned that it’s 
illegal in all countries for Mr. Neal to trade 
money, goods or services for organs. The black 
market is extremely dangerous and exploits a 
lot of individuals desperate for money. Kidneys 
can go for up to $300,000 on the black market, 
while the donor is paid just $650.

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West!
Do you know about Angelina Jolie’s surgery 

to remove her breasts and prevent breast cancer 
(known as a double mastectomy)? The odds 
are good that you do. Did you also know that 
mastectomies aren’t generally recommended 
for women? Only those with a specific gene that 
make it more likely to develop breast cancer are 
recommended for the surgery. 

This factoid is much less sexy or inspirational 

(sexpirational?) than the headline, “Most 
beautiful woman in the world shockingly 
sacrifices breasts to prevent death.” While Ms. 

Jolie is incredibly inspirational in her work as 
a U.N. Ambassador, her medical procedure 
should have come with a disclaimer to her loyal 
fans — borrow her style, her clothes, her look, 
but not her invasive surgical procedure.

These two examples are just the tip of the 

iceberg when it comes to celebrities influencing 
health in a three-ring circus that includes 
everything from Jennifer Aniston endorsing 
better bottled water to an endless parade of 
B-list celebrities’ diet and weight-loss products 
and services.

Government, health care and other public 

health-care organizations are supposed to be 
the public counterweight to faulty celebrity 
health claims and misunderstandings, but they 
struggle to harness the necessary glamour 
and star power needed to get everyone to pay 
attention to health insurance or mammogram 
factoids. However, a notable exception is the 
NOMORE campaign, a celebrity-filled effort to 
end sexual assault and domestic violence.

This may, of course, be a cost issue. In an 

attempt to rehabilitate the image of Obamacare, 
the federal government will spend at least $684 
million on promoting it annually. In 2010, $50 
billion dollars was spent hiring celebrities to 
endorse products. Magazine advertisers in the 
United States spends $15.1 billion each year.

So what’s the takeaway?
As educated young adults who are 

independent consumers of the health, health 
care and diet industries, as well as students 
at a prestigious medical research University 
here in the United States, we need to look 
deeper into what health care messages 
the media and celebrities are directing 
at us. While we may feel these things are 
superficial or trivial, they’re undoubtedly 
 

very influential.

We should also remember that we have 

some power to influence what celebrities 
support and speak about: tweet, donate and 
e-mail until your favorite celebrity knows 
about your cause. The same goes for the 
government, as well: get out and vote, e-mail 
your congressperson, campaign for your 
favorite presidential nominee. And finally: as 
professionals, we should never underestimate 
the value of a high-profile spokesperson.

Health-care and public-health sectors 

would be very well served to step up their 
game by attempting to get more celebrities, 
communications 
and 
P.R. 
professionals 

involved in meaningful health campaigns, 
demonstrating 
an 
understanding 
that 

investing in a great campaign is worth as 
much as a pair of Yeezy exclusive sneakers.

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Daily Film Columnist

I should be upfront: I am 

not the biggest Wes Craven 
aficionado. So maybe I’m not 
the best person to write about 
him and the horror genre 
that he helped elevate into a 
unique combination of art and 
commercial filmmaking over 
a 20-year period. Still, in the 
few films of his I have seen, I’ve 
found something creative yet 
manipulative, self-deprecating 
but dead serious, terrifying and 
downright funny. Craven is a 
unique director for a unique 
genre, and sifting through the 
pools of blood and gore that 
smother his films, I have come 
to recognize just what it means 
to watch a horror film.

In my experience, filmgoers 

split down the middle in a love-
it-or-hate-it sort of way in their 
appreciation of horror, but I 
have more of a hate-that-I-
love-it mentality. I was exposed 
to horror films at a young 
age and they messed with my 
head, really badly. When I was 
eight or nine, after I saw “The 
Shining,” I thought every time 
I turned a corner , some eerie 
twin girls would stop me in my 
tracks and stare me down. And 
after “The Sixth Sense,” I knew 
I would one day wake in the 
middle of the night to the creak 
of a floorboard and slowly open 
my eyes only to see a sickly pale 
ghost as she vomits on the floor. 
These thoughts haunted me, 
scarred me for years, but still 
I would watch and shiver and 
jump, then watch some more.

I realized I loved the thrill of 

it all, the sensation of my heart 
pounding heavier and faster 
with each passing second as the 
protagonist slowly walks down 
a 
darkened 
hallway, 
floors 

screeching as if warning him 
to turn away, the camera still, 
stalking the character. And 
I loved the jump scares that 
pumped me with energy, like 
John Travolta just stabbed me 
in the chest with an eight-inch 
needle of adrenaline.

But when the lights come up 

and the energy dies down, you 
leave the safety of the theater; 
it’s the real world now, a world 
with its own monsters and 
unexplained phenomenon. And 
sometimes you feel like you’re 
being watched, sometimes you 
feel like you’re being followed. 
“It’s just a movie,” you tell 
yourself, so why do you feel so 

disturbed?

At least, that’s how I felt — 

still feel — when I watch horror 
films. They infect my brain like 
a cancer, send terror down my 
spine — I’ll feel a hand brush 
against my shoulder, I’ll hear a 
faint sound, a whisper. I turn 
but nothing is there. They mess 
with my mind: it’s a pretty 
unique effect.

There’s an art to terror, to 

digging under the skin to tap 
into a primal fear. The director 
must take a seemingly ordinary 
event and twist and deform 
it into something physically 
or morally wrong, sometimes 
both at once, but make it at 
least 
somewhat 
believable. 

Sometimes that manifests itself 
in a zombie apocalypse, as in 
George Romero’s “Night of the 
Living Dead.” Sometimes it’s 
a scientist’s experiment gone 
horribly wrong as in David 
Cronenberg’s “The Fly,” or a 
chameleonic alien that invades 
a settlement on Antarctica like 
John Carpenter’s “The Thing.”

But 
with 
all 
of 
those 

aforementioned 
films, 
the 

protagonists 
happen 
upon 

these monsters and situations: 
an 
alien 
just 
happens 
to 

crash land on Antarctica, the 
characters just happen to be 
at the mall when the zombie 
apocalypse starts. These are all 
outside scenarios from which, 
theoretically, you could run. In 
“A Nightmare on Elm Street,” 
Wes Craven did something 
different — something twisted. 
He made the subconscious, 
dream itself, the battleground.

Think about it: the one safe 

place in this insane world, the 
one place where you can find 
solace and peace and absolute 
freedom becomes corrupted, 
cruel, evil. You can neither run 
nor hide from sleep. Craven 
turns it against you; every 
waking hour marks one step 
closer to sleep, to death.

In 
“Elm 
Street” 
the 

characters’ 
happiest 
dreams 

devolve, 
descend 
into 
Hell 

itself, Freddy Kreuger’s boiler 
room: we feel the heat burning 
off the screen, the screeching of 
metal on metal pierces our ears. 
And suddenly there is Freddy in 
the shadows, taking his sweet 
time, toying with his victims, 
torturing them. And then he 
tears them apart.

In his best films, Craven made 

the enemy not some unknown, 
foreign entity like an alien or a 
zombie. The enemy always lives 
close to the protagonist in some 
way: dreams in “Elm Street,” 
classmates 
and 
boyfriends 

in “Scream.” And that makes 
it 
personal, 
because 
the 

protagonist’s safety – our safety, 
becomes 
threatened. 
Those 

fears remain after the film ends 
— it’s the stuff nightmares are 
made on.

And though many of his 

films have lost much of their 
punch with the desensitization 
that 
naturally 
occurs 
with 

the passage of time and the 
improvement of new effects 
and techniques, there remains 
something 
profoundly 

disturbing in them. I know 
this because the night before I 
wrote this column, I watched 
“A Nightmare on Elm Street” 
immediately before sleep; it 
was not a particularly restful 
one. Maybe I just scare easily 
(though I’d like to think not), 
but maybe the film holds up, 
too.

For better or worse, Wes 

Craven made films that stuck 
with me, and that’s all I can 
really ask from a film. Sure there 
are days when I need to kill some 
time, so I watch a run-of-the-
mill action or comedy movie, but 
in general, if I’m investing my 
time, I want to gain something 
from it. Wes Craven didn’t teach 
me any lessons; he didn’t help 
me learn anything about myself 
beyond a tolerance for spilled 
blood, but he did scare the shit 
out of me, a lot; those images 
of a young Johnny Depp being 
devoured by his mattress and 
regurgitated as a pool of blood 
or of a lifeless Drew Barrymore 
dangling from a tree will forever 
remain in my mind.

I think he would consider 

that a profound success. I know 
I do, because I can still hear it 
now: one, two Freddy’s coming 
for you …

FILM COLUMN

Wes Craven, I’ll 

see you in my 
nightmares

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

“Do what you gotta do,” says 

David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel, 
“Sex Tape”) when confronted 
with the tape 
recorder of his 
interviewer. 
The recorder is 
a physical rep-
resentation 
of 

the 
emotional 

divide between 
the two men, 
as 
one 
tries 

to 
present 
a 

respectable version of himself 
and the other has an obligation to 
tear him down. The other man is 
Rolling Stone reporter David Lip-
sky (Jesse Eisenberg, “American 
Ultra”), who chose the assignment 
of travelling with Wallace for the 
last five days of his 1997 book tour 
for Infinite Jest.

Based on Lipsky’s memoir, 

Although of Course You End Up 
Becoming Yourself, this tale of two 
Davids, like both men, is full of 
beautiful contradictions. Wallace 
has finally obtained recognition 
for his work, but with it comes fear 
and self-doubt. Lipsky, however, 
has also just published a novel, but 
the indifferent attention it received 

does not compare to the love given 
to Wallace’s masterpiece. Lipsky’s 
desire to interview Wallace stems 
from this jealous admiration, pre-
senting Wallace with a challenge 
– to prove himself to the world, but 
especially to his fellow writers.

Unsurprisingly, this roadtrip 

film is mostly dialogue. But with 
James Ponsoldt (“The Spectacular 
Now”) as director, the aimless con-
versation meanders into the most 
compelling of areas. When Lipsky 
arrives at Wallace’s snowed-in 
house in Illinois, they quickly go 
deep into his fears, loneliness and 
failure to recognize the greatness 
he has achieved. In his cluttered 
house with two big affectionate 
black dogs, Wallace has built a hid-
ing place from a world that loves 
him so much that he even unlisted 
his phone number.

When they go out on the road, 

Lipsky has a chance to immerse 
himself in his jealousy. He watches 
as Wallace reads to a packed crowd, 
appears on public radio and speaks 
to Lipsky’s girlfriend on the phone 
for almost half an hour. Instead of 
basking in this glory, Wallace is 
haunted by the same sadness and 
loneliness that would provoke his 
suicide 11 years later. Segel plays 
this side of Wallace with contained 
ease. His elusive mannerisms and 

subtlety conveys the power of the 
man and the tempestuous side that 
he tries so hard to hide. Playing 
well off Segel, Eisenberg uses his 
trademark acrimony to highlight 
the false friendship of this inter-
viewer-interviewee relationship. 
But the depth of the relationship 
goes beyond friendship to admi-
ration, disgust and even close to 
hatred. Considering the goof-off 
parts that these actors have chosen 
in the past, it was a pleasant shock 
to see them handle these roles so 
thoughtfully.

One of the most interesting 

parts of this film is how much 
its subject would have hated it. 
Wallace’s family has objected to 
the movie’s creation, stating that 
“David would never have agreed 
that those saved transcripts could 
later be repurposed as the basis of 
a movie.” To be diminished into a 
cinematic parody of himself would 
be embarrassing to anyone, but for 
Wallace, whose self-consciousness 
knew no bounds, it would have 
been crushing.

So out of respect for Wallace and 

his brilliance complemented best 
by his “regular guy-ness,” we must 
take this film as a vague adaptation 
of what he was like. But it’s a fantas-
tic vague adaptation, and it is lucky 
to have such a great man at its roots.

‘Teenage Girl’ is 
brutally honest

Frank sex scenes 

abound in adaptation 
of UM prof.’s novel 

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

“The Diary of a Teenage Girl” 

is raw, in your face and unapolo-
getically uncomfortable. It builds 
its aura around 
the 
dynam-

ic of what is 
considered 
acceptable and 
socially 
unac-

ceptable and, by 
doing so, audi-
ences succumb 
to 
watching, 

following 
and 

loving a per-
fectly 
casted 

story of discov-
ery and social 
acceptability.

Speaking in generalizations, 

the world has “normal” people 
and “abnormal” people. How-
ever, despite being “normal,” 
we all have the stray abnormal 
thought. We might keep it to 
ourselves and ask “Why did I 
just think that?” Our normal-
ness certainly outweighs our 
stray moments of abnormality. 
“The Diary of a Teenage Girl” is 
the culmination of those stray, 
atypical moments.

Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley, 

“M.I. High”), an average subur-
ban girl growing up in 1970’s San 
Francisco, opens the film with “I 
had sex today. Holy shit.” Min-
nie is the movie’s focal point. 
She, just like most people, can be 
both extremely self-involved and 
self-loathing, depicted through 
scenes in which she documents 
her diary on a cassette recorder. 
She has bad bangs and thinks 
about sex almost exclusively. 
And the thing with Minnie — 
viewers have absolutely every 
right to dislike like her for all of 
the aforementioned reasons, but 
it’s the balance of all her flawed 

characteristics that allow the 
audience to connect with her. 
Moreover, Powly’s portrayal is 
ethereal, bringing a social awk-
wardness and light humor to the, 
at times, extremely dark plot.

Following Minnie’s declara-

tion of her non-existent vir-
ginity, time lapses back and we 
learn that she lost her virginity 
to her mother’s (Kristen Wiig, 
“Bridesmaids”) 
boyfriend, 

Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard, 
“True Blood”). This point in the 
film’s synopsis invites a cringe, 
but 
the 
onscreen 
romance 

between Monroe and Minnie is 
nearly the opposite. He may be 
35 and she 15, but there’s some-
thing behind Minnie’s bangs, 
something immediately after 
her self-obsession and imme-
diately before her self-loathing 
that pushes their love away 
from deplorable and toward 
something more tender.

Aside from Powly, Wiig is 

the only standout performance. 
(Skarsgard does well, but the 
depth of his character is mini-
mal in comparison.) For the 
first hour of the film, Minnie’s 
mother, Charlotte, is drunk and 
high, throwing parties (which 
15-year-old Minnie is delight-
ed to take part in). Even while 

Minnie is having sex with Char-
lotte’s boyfriend, Charlotte is 
often overshadowed by what is 
happening on screen between 
Minnie and Munroe. Charlotte, 
at first oblivious to the affair, 
eventually discovers Minnie’s 
diary and tearfully asks, “How 
long?” 
after 
which 
Minnie 

leaves home for several days. 
Her moment of humanity comes 
as she embraces Minnie upon 
her return. She hugs, cries, 
kisses and chokes out, “I need 
to never talk about this again.” 
It wasn’t an “I forgive you” or 
an “It’s OK” typically said after 
fuck-ups. Despite the movie cir-
cling Minnie’s self-discovery, 
it’s that line that rings as the 
most honest throughout the 
already candid 102 minutes.

“The Diary of a Teenage Girl” 

isn’t kind to its viewers. It says 
everything we don’t want to hear 
and does everything we don’t 
want to do — which is exactly why 
it’s necessary. If no one ever slept 
with their mom’s boyfriend, how 
would we know what would work 
out? Minnie discovered herself in 
an unconventional 1970’s fashion, 
but if it weren’t for her, would we 
know how to shake someone’s 
hand and think “I’m better than 
you, you son of a bitch?”

For The Daily

I remember back when Tra-

vis Scott first announced him-
self 
to 
the 

Internet. A few 
blogs 
start-

ed 
buzzing 

when pictures 
of 
him 
with 

Kanye 
West 

started 
mak-

ing the rounds, 
and 
they 

announced 
that G.O.O.D. Music had signed 
“the next Kanye.” Travis did his 
best to dress like Kanye and Kid 
Cudi and he would even modify 
his voice to sound like them on 
record. At the time, his entire 
fan base was encompassed by a 
single thread on a music forum, 
tellingly titled “KanyeToThe...”

Since rap hasn’t been quite as 

Kanye-centric the past couple 
years, the hilariously inorganic 
manner in which Travis has 
“evolved” should not be over-
looked. Just as the music world’s 
attention turned to Atlanta as a 
hotbed for bizarre artists (see: 
Young Thug, ILoveMakonnen, 
Future), Travis, out of left field, 
released 
a 
mixtape 
carried 

entirely by featured rappers and 
producers from Atlanta. The 
production credits reveal he’s 
not the five-beats-a-day-for-
three-summers young Kanye 
protégé he makes himself out 
to be. Travis only co-produced 
one track off the mixtape, while 
four other producers cleaned 
up after him.This was pre-Yee-
zus 2013, a time when plenty of 
fledgling Internet rappers were 
beginning to piece together 
parts of Kanye’s identity and 
construct them as their own. 
From the onset of his career, 
Scotty “La Flame” (suspiciously 
close to Gucci Mane “La Flare”) 
never even attempted to present 
himself as a legitimate person-
ality. But hip hop was so deep 
into the Church of Yetheism 
that Kanye’s cronies got a pass 
for aestheticized plagiarism.

Travis Scott was born from 

the ashes left behind by the 
phoenix on the cover of My 
Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 
and it has emanated through 
everything he’s touched in his 
short and fraudulent career. 
When Kanye curated a star-
studded guest list for Twisted 
Fantasy, he turned the album 
into his own tasteful award 
show of sorts, rather than let it 
serve as a distraction for him to 
hide behind. Travis, however, 
has a proven track record of 
using high-profile features to 
play hot potato with the music 
industry.

2013 saw him birthed into 

relevance by Kanye and T.I. In 

2014, he latched onto dynam-
ic duo Rich Homie Quan and 
Young Thug, and now on Rodeo 
he has features from Justin 
Bieber and The Weeknd, who 
has been building steam on a 
year-long hype train packed 
with great pop records. Is it not 
suspicious that this guy already 
has such an illustrious and well-
timed list of collaborators with-
out even first building a local 
following? Why is the music 
industry trying so hard to make 
this guy happen? Is Travis Scott 
an industry plant? His trajecto-
ry thus far certainly looks that 
way. Point being, if rap were a 
high school, he would’ve been 
the kid who sat at a different 
lunch table every day in search 
of the elusive cool table.

It comes as no surprise that 

the first voice on Rodeo doesn’t 
even belong to Jacques Webster. 
In a fashion not too dissimilar 
from the role of Common on 
Kid Cudi’s Man On The Moon 
series, T.I. floats in and out of 
the album with cringe-worthy 
monologues about a “young 
rebel against the system” (iron-
ic, because the powers that be 
are very clearly working on his 
behalf). “Oh My Dis Side” sees 
Travis go for that hardly-audi-
ble-but-expressive type of rap-
ping that codeine-fueled artists 
like Future and Chief Keef have 
mastered, but his delivery falls 
short of the emotion required to 
make you feel … anything. Even 
when Future mumbles lyrics in 
his classic Xanaxed-out daze, 
it’s at least about something 
(usually heartbreak) or sung in 
a way that evokes feeling; Tra-
vis spends the track mumbling 
about nothing, leaving only 
drab vibes and sonics (two of 
his favorite words) in place of a 
legitimate song.

The inconsistency in terms of 

who Travis works with leaves 
all of his collaborations void 
of any chemistry. It’s as if two 
strangers had to share a stu-
dio and made a song while they 
were at it. When he finally does 
snag someone from the cool 
table for a feature, the authen-
ticity of their personality auto-
matically takes the limelight 
— every time. Migos’ Quavo 
appears on the latter half of “Dis 
Side” to give a heartfelt recount 
of his rags-to-Versace come-
up. “3500” is basically a Future 
song where Travis only stops 
by for the adlibs (the “straight 
up” adlib was coined by Future 
anyways). Travis really outdoes 
himself on “Pray 4 Love” with 
bars like “Contemplatin’ forni-
catin’ / Might as well fuck up 
some shit / They lookin’ at me 

way too crazy / Got me feelin’ 
communist.” He doesn’t really 
make any sense, but how ‘bout 
those Vibes™, right? The only 
time it even feels like a real 
human being is on the track is 
when The Weeknd closes out 
the song.

The hotly anticipated “Piss 

On Your Grave” features Kanye 
himself, who again renegades 
Travis on his own track. Kanye 
takes a break from Hampton 
spouses to use an executive’s 
face as a urinal, which, although 
crude, channels the same frus-
tration as 2013’s “New Slaves.” 
Travis makes yet another for-
gettable appearance on his own 
song, with lines like “Told my 
momma ‘bitch get back in the 
door’” and “Kamikaze over 
commas” (another obvious bite 
from Future’s jargon). The dis-
parity between their verses 
highlights the fact that context 
and transparency are supposed 
to shed light on an artist’s char-
acter and identity, which Travis 
has none of.

For example, Kanye raps 

about urinating on an executive 
because of his well-documented 
struggles in entering the fash-
ion industry (see: Yeezus). For 
Travis though, there’s really 
nothing left to say, as his every 
word is an attempt to recreate a 
black-rockstar persona that he 
also stole from Mr. West. More 
than anything in this world, 
Travis Scott wants his music to 
sound as important as the art-
ists he bites, but would he ever 
really have enough substance 
to deliver a speech like the one 
Kanye delivered last week at 
the VMAs? Or communicate 
his upbringing through his 
music, like Chief Keef? Or be as 
painfully honest as artists like 
Future and Drake? No, but he 
can hire their producers.

Travis’s identity crisis is the cen-

tral issue regarding not just Rodeo, 
but his entire career. He hides 
behind a legion of Kanye’s side-
kicks and Atlanta super-producers 
to curate something artistically 
worth much less than the sum of 
its parts. Yes, Rodeo is packed with 
high-thread count beats and is one 
of the best-engineered albums 
since Daft Punk’s Random Access 
Memories, but only with the help 
of names like Mike Dean, Kanye 
West and Metro Boomin. The 
album closes with a series of ques-
tions from T.I regarding the young 
revolutionary: “Will he make it? 
Was it worth it? Did he win? Will 
he survive the rodeo?” But these 
are all the wrong questions. By the 
end of Rodeo, only one pertinent 
question remains: honestly, who is 
Travis Scott?

Driesenga returns for 
fifth year at Michigan

Pitcher receives 
medical hardship 
waiver after injury 

last season

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Through 
the 
first 
two 

weeks of the Michigan softball 
team’s 2015 campaign, senior 
right-hander 
Sara 
Driesenga 

stood out among the three-
headed monster that was the 
Wolverines’ pitching rotation. 
The co-captain got off to a 
4-0 start with a dazzling 0.78 
earned-run 
average. 
Boosted 

by 
Driesenga’s 
quick 
start, 

Michigan started the season 
with an 8-1 record.

But her dominance was short-

lived. While the Wolverines 
continued to succeed throughout 
the remainder of the year, 
Driesenga suffered a season-
ending rib injury in the third 
week of the season. Suddenly, 
her senior year as one of the best 
right-handers in the Big Ten was 
over and her collegiate softball 
career was in jeopardy.

“At first we thought (I would 

be unable to play for) a week or 
two,” Driesenga said. “Then I 
would be good to go. But after 
the MRI, it showed that it was 
fractured. I worked hard to come 
back all season, but the pain was 
still there in the rib.”

Even 
though 
Michigan’s 

co-captain didn’t return to the 
circle, the rest of the pitching 
staff — since-graduated left-
hander 
Haylie 
Wagner 
and 

then-junior right-hander Megan 
Betsa — excelled in Driesenga’s 
absence. Their success could be 
partly accredited to Driesenga’s 
advice 
and 
encouragement 

in practice and in the dugout 
during games.

“As a captain, I wasn’t just 

trying to help (the pitchers), but 
the whole team,” Driesenga said. 
“We always had that pitching 
time, but when I couldn’t be the 
one to pitch during that time, I 
wanted whoever was out there 
to do their best so we could be 
successful.”

Now healed from the injury, 

Driesenga will have another 
chance to help the Wolverines 
next 
season. 
Although 
she 

graduated 
last 
semester, 

Driesenga was given a medical 
hardship for last season, giving 
her another year of eligibility 
to compete in Michigan’s 2015-
2016 campaign while pursuing 
her master’s degree in social 
work.

“We 
first 
knew 
that 

(returning) 
was 
an 
option 

after the season was over when 
(the medical exemption) got 
approved,” 
Driesenga 
said. 

“There was no question in my 
mind that I wanted to come 
back. I did all this hard work 
to keep developing myself and 
to keep helping the program as 
much as I can.”

Driesenga’s return to the 

team will once again cement 
the Wolverine pitching staff as 
one of the best in the country. 
Michigan boasted a 1.66 ERA 
last season, good for fifth in the 
nation. While Wagner graduated 
and will be missed, Betsa is 
ready to cement her place as one 
of the elite pitchers in the nation. 
Sophomore first baseman Tera 
Blanco may see some time in the 
circle for the Wolverines, and 
Leah Crockett — an incoming 
freshman and two-time all-state 
selection from New York — is in 
the mix for a spot in the rotation 
as well.

The 
pitching 
staff 
could 

include two to four pitchers, 
depending on how well Blanco 
and Crockett perform in the 
offseason, and on how coach 
Carol 
Hutchins’ 
strategy 

develops 
throughout 
the 

season. No matter how it shakes 

out, Driesenga will provide 
leadership, 
experience 
and 

pitching prowess to a team 
coming off a national runner-up 
run.

“(Hutchins 
is) 
definitely 

excited,” Driesenga said. “She’s 
publicized that, she’s said it to me. 
I think it’s an advantage when 
me and (senior second baseman 
Sierra Romero) were captains last 
year, and we’ll keep working hard 
and keep developing as much as 
we can. I think Hutch is excited 
about that as well.”

Added 
Hutchins 
in 
an 

interview with MGoBlue.com: 
“Last year’s curse is this year’s 
blessing. … She’s a great pitcher, 
and she’s going to be great asset 
to Team 39.”

With one year left to finish 

what she started last season, 
Driesenga hopes to pass on her 
wisdom to her teammates, saying 
she could probably write a book 
about the subject. She wants her 
teammates to enjoy their time 
as Wolverines because, as she 
knows, it flies by.

“I 
think 
it’s 
all 
about 

perspective while you’re here,” 
Driesenga said. “(For me) it’s like, 
‘I get to do this another year! I get 
this opportunity to stay at this 
great university and be a part of 
something that is so much bigger 
than myself.’ … It’s an opportunity 
that not a lot of people get.”

Driesenga will relish the 

chance to play for Michigan 
again, hoping to be an integral 
part of another World Series run. 
If the Wolverines are fortunate 
enough to get back to the WCWS 
next season, she could be the 
missing piece of the puzzle for 
Michigan to capture the title.

Wolverines look inward 
for answers after defeat

Extra film, 

conditioning help 
Michigan regroup 

for week two

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Even if its season-opening 

road loss to Utah went mostly as 
expected, the Michigan football 
team was far from content to 
accept it.

Speaking 
to 
reporters 

Tuesday at Schembechler Hall, 
the Wolverines detailed the 
ways they’ve tried to rebound 
from the defeat.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith said that as soon as he 
got on the bus after Thursday’s 
24-17 loss to the Utes, he dove 
into the game film and could tell 
immediately what went wrong.

“I graded out myself and I 

gave myself a ‘C,’ ” Smith said. 
“(I was) missing the holes, 
dropping passes, not getting out 
quick enough on protections 
and into your route, it all comes 
into a factor. … I noticed every 
little mistake I did.”

Smith’s 
self-evaluation 
is 

fair, based on the numbers — he 
averaged 2.8 yards per carry, 
and his longest rush of the day 
went for just seven yards. He 
consistently broke away from 
arm tackles, but he wasn’t able 
to turn them into big gains.

Likewise, 
senior 
center 

Graham Glasgow and the rest 
of the offensive line were able 
to catch their mistakes on film. 
But when asked about seeing 
flashes of the offense’s potential 
against Utah, Glasgow took an 
especially positive stance.

“I felt better in this loss than 

I would after some of our wins 
last year,” Glasgow said. “I feel 
that we had some mistakes 
that we needed to correct, but 
they’re not like glaring. There 
are some things, but it’s pad 
level and things that we can 
correct right away.”

Harbaugh 

said 
Monday 

that Glasgow 
graded out as 
the 
highest-

rated offensive 
lineman from 
the 
Utah 

game, a good 
sign 
for 
a 

player 
who 

previously had 
limited collegiate experience at 
center.

It 
wasn’t 
a 
perfect 

performance, but the coaching 
staff easily isolated the areas 
it felt hurt Michigan the most. 
This week, the offensive line 
has been working extra time 
with chutes in practice to 
force their pad level low and in 
position while moving forward 
and laterally.

In practice after the game, 

Harbaugh instituted an activity 
called “The Michigan Mile.” 
Players weren’t given much 
instruction, simply to run a 
certain number of laps around 
the outermost perimeter of 
the field, which supposedly 
amounts to a mile.

And as is the case with 

nearly 
every 
drill 
under 

Harbaugh, its effect has been 
more competition. Ojemudia 
and Smith identified redshirt 
freshman receiver Moe Ways as 
the winner of this week’s mile, 
but it didn’t sound like much 
fuss was made over the winner.

“If you win, you get the 

satisfaction 
of 
winning,” 

Ojemudia said. “It’s a race if 
you’re racing it, but mostly it’s 
for conditioning.”

What’s 
more, 
Harbaugh 

and the staff doubled down on 
film sessions by having them 
watch film both as an offense or 
defense and again as a specific 

position 
group.

For redshirt 

freshman 
safety Jabrill 
Peppers, 
that 
meant 

getting called 
out in front 
of the entire 
room 
when 

he 
missed 

assignments. 
When 
asked 

how intense the teaching time 
was, Peppers couldn’t help but 
chuckle.

“It was pretty intense, it 

was pretty intense,” Peppers 
said. “I’m not going to go into 
too much detail, (but) they 
definitely got after us, and me in 
particular.”

But according to Peppers, he 

took it in stride, embracing the 
criticism rather than running 
from it.

“That’s one of the things 

about 
being 
coachable 
— 

handling constructive criticism 
and when you know you can 
do better,” Peppers said. “So 
they’re honest with us, and 
they hold each and every one 
of us accountable. They’ve seen 
what I put forth in camp and 
all spring, and going out there 
and laying an egg like that 
on the first game, it’s just not 
acceptable.”

you get the 

satisfaction of 

winning.”

Finally back on the field, 
Peppers reflects on play

Safety admits to 
being overeager 
early, but settled 
down during game

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Jabrill Peppers arrived on 

campus before last season as 
a mega-recruit, one expected 
to make an immediate impact 
all over the field for Michigan. 
He had committed to the 
Wolverines 
in 
a 
nationally 

televised rap as the No. 2 recruit 
in the nation the year before, 
and 
some 
even 
compared 

him to Charles Woodson, the 
gold standard for Michigan 
cornerbacks. He stuck by his 
decision 
even 
when 
other 

schools attempted to sway him 
in the midst of the Wolverines’ 
turmoil.

But then things fell apart for 

Peppers. He suffered a leg injury 
in Michigan’s opener against 
Appalachian State and received 
limited action against Miami 
(Ohio) and Utah before he was 

shut down for the season.

So 
it 
was 
natural 
that 

Peppers, in his season debut 
last Thursday against Utah, 
was overeager. He admitted 
Tuesday that he attempted to 
come out of the gate with a 
bang, reaching for the big play 
instead of making the safe and 
correct one.

“Once I started to settle in, 

be 
patient, 

read my keys, 
trust 
the 

technique, 
that’s 
something 
they 
always 

tell 
me,” 

Peppers said. 
“Sometimes I 
think that my 
speed and my 
athleticism 
will make that play for me when 
I should use both in terms of 
using my technique and then 
allow my speed or my quickness 
to make the play for me.”

Peppers finished his season 

debut 
with 
eight 
tackles, 

including two for loss. Despite 
mistakes early in the game — he 
mentioned a time he left his man 

open in coverage to attempt a 
sack of Utah quarterback Travis 
Wilson 
— 
Peppers 
proved 

capable of using his speed to 
seal off screens and his strength 
to make tackles in the open field.

One thing that irked Peppers 

from the game was the defense’s 
lack of turnovers, save for 
redshirt junior Jeremy Clark’s 
interception on a Hail Mary to 

end the first 
half. Turnover 
margin 
plagued 
the 

Wolverines 
last season as 
well.

“It’s 
about 

playing 
the 

way we know 
how to play,” 
Peppers 
said. 

“Stop 
feeling 

sorry for ourselves, and stop 
making excuses for why we’re 
not playing the way that we’re 
capable (of) playing.”

Peppers attempted to remedy 

that, playing the entire game 
from start to finish. For someone 
looking to whet his competitive 
appetite after almost a full 

“When they 

call my number, 
I’m going to be 

ready.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Redshirt freshman Jabrill Peppers is finally earning consistent playing time after missing most of 2014 with an injury.

year away from game action, 
that was a desirable starting 
point. Peppers did not know 
how to name his particular 
role on defense, saying that it 
was a combination of safety, 
nickelback 
and 
cornerback. 

Each week’s game plan will 
dictate exactly where he plays.

On special teams, Peppers 

fielded punts and kicks for 
Michigan. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh called his work on 
the punt team “outstanding” 
and “spectacular,” particularly 
with respect to a diving first-
quarter fair catch of a punt 

that could have prevented the 
ball from bouncing deep into 
Wolverine territory. When he 
was given the chance to display 
some moves in the return game 
— instead of the necessary fair 
catches on the punt return — 
Peppers knifed through Utah’s 
coverage for 36 yards in the 
fourth quarter.

Though the workload on 

defense and special teams did 
require Peppers to make some 
adjustments in terms of how 
he exerted energy, he was not 
overly concerned.

“It’s all of the things that I 

myself wanted to do and that 
the coaches allow me to do, 
because they know I’m able to 
do it,” Peppers said.

Peppers did not see any 

action on the offensive side of 
the ball in the opener, despite 
Harbaugh’s admission in the 
preseason that Peppers could 
very well play offense this 
season.

Peppers was coy when asked 

if that is still the plan.

“It just depends on how things 

go,” he said. “The offense, like I 
said, they were a couple of plays 
away from changing the game.

“If they need me to help 

in some way, I’d be more 
than happy to do it, whether 
it’s 
receiver, 
running 
back, 

quarterback, doesn’t matter. As 
far as that goes, I’m just playing 
it by ear. When they call my 
number, I’m going to be ready.”

T

his is an open call for 
problems.

From what I know 

— personally and statistically 
— it is clear you’ve got them.

I absentmindedly ate two 

stale brownies last night 
while googling “how to be 
a good girlfriend.” I have a 
weird-in-all-the-right-ways 
friend who listens to me talk 
for long periods of time about 
these 
sorts 
of 
somewhat 

self-created problems, and 
without fail at some point 
during our conversations she 
will suggest I google the topic 
at hand. When in doubt, we 
turn to Google.

She also listens to me 

talk 
about 
other 
sorts 

of problems. The ones I 
wouldn’t ask anyone but her 
and Google — the unnerving 
types of questions that pop 
up as suggestions below the 
Google search bar, the little 
things that pick at our brains. 
Questions of self exploration, 
questions about life when it 
doesn’t look like you thought 

it would that inevitably arise. 
Questions that come up when 
you realize it’s easy to think 
theoretically about being a 
“good girlfriend,” but less 
easy to define what being 
a good, positive partner to 
someone really is and that it’s 
even more difficult to actually 
do it.

Organizations 
such 
as 

Central Student Government 
and 
the 
University’s 

Counseling and Psychological 
Services 
will 
provide 

students with the resources 
to overcome serious mental 
health concerns. But as college 
students, such resources may 
be unnecessary in dealing 
with the smaller concerns 
that plague our day-to-day 
experience.

My actual name is Emma, 

but I think this semester, I 
want to be Google for you. 
I have no qualifications as 
a professional counselor or 
adviser beyond my personal 
experience, but I’m willing to 
lend advice to those who want 

it. I am not a medical doctor, I 
have no ground to stand on in 
claiming I may be able to help 
you in some way with your all 
too real problems — but I’m 
offering you, at the very least, 
another perspective.

I 
hope 
to 
offer 
you 

a 
thoughtful, 
personal 

response — one that doesn’t 
include 
a 
numbered 
list 

of generalizations — and 
one 
that 
will 
generate 

conversation and reflection, 
and also make your life a little 
easier in some way. I believe 
that’s all anyone really has to 
offer another person in these 
types of situations.

It’s 
been 
done 
before 

— the advice thing — but 
nevertheless, this is the start 
of my own column. You can 
reach me via my e-mail here 
at the Daily at emkerr@
michigandaily.com, and in 
exchange for your honesty, 
I promise you anonymity,

your

problem be chosen as the

When Netflix comes to India

O

n a typical summer day, 
I’m presented with a lot 
of 
choices. 
Too 
many, 

it seems. I can keep watching 
“Hannibal”, which I’ve already 
decided is amazing and the most 
visually unique thing I’ve seen on 
TV, but which I can’t seem to keep 
watching. I could start a new show 
— maybe “Orphan Black”? I’ve 
wanted to see that for a while. Or 
I could get around to finishing that 
Jonathan Franzen novel that I’ve 
sworn to all my friends is so good. 
Actually, maybe I should just go to 
the gym.

This pisses me off.
Netflix and the rise of instant 

entertainment 
have 
decimated 

any sense of commitment when 
it comes to pastimes. When you 
pop in a DVD — or a VCR, for 
that matter — you’ve essentially 
declared yourself to this movie. 
You now have a quite compelling 
obligation to finish this, no matter 
the quality. I can’t tell you how 
many movies are gathering dust at 
the end of my “Continue Watching” 
section on Netflix.

And, to my surprise, it became 

more difficult to sit down and tear 
through a good book this summer. 
I can vividly remember when 
reading came as easily to me as 
watching a rerun of “The Office” 
does today. Two summers ago, I 
re-read the entire Harry Potter 
series in one week. This summer, 
I’ve finished my fair share of books, 
but it felt like I had to work for it. It 
was something I had to conceive of, 
plan out, and execute rather than 
simply lying on the sofa and doing 
it.

On one hand, having this many 

TV shows, movies, books, music, 
and more at my fingertips is a 
luxury. But I do wish it were more 
simple. When I visited India this 
year, I was reminded of one aspect 
of the culture, of a place I had 
visited countless times before, of 
people I’d loved and who’d loved 

me back since before I was born: 
simplicity.

My cousins all wake up in the 

morning, eat breakfast, and go to 
school. They come back, they eat 
something, and then go out and 
play for hours. Dinner, and then 
homework, and then bedtime. On 
the weekends, they spend time 
with their families— go out to a 
movie, do some shopping, help in 
the kitchen. These are their lives.

For 
years, 
I 
had 
always 

looked down on my cousins, 
condescending and patronizing, 
internally lamenting their lack of 
driver’s licenses and freedom. This 
year, I felt something different. I 
realized I was instead jealous — 
and I was an asshole.

They never fret about whether 

or not their friends are hanging out 
without them, or worry about how 
many likes their profile picture 
will get. No one really works out, 
because 
people 
would 
rather 

eat their mother’s home-cooked 
food and feel satisfied than eat a 
kale salad and feel crappy. If they 
don’t do their homework, they’re 
scolded, but more playfully, in a 
way that, in the end, they know 
it’s all part of life and sometimes 
you’d rather spend time with your 
friends than do work.

Compare that to academic life 

where I grew up, where a failed test 
or assignment came with the side 
effects of crippling worry, reduced 
college aspirations, and panicked 
attempts to regain your standing 
among your peers. Their choices 
aren’t “Hannibal”, the gym, or 
“Freedom” by Jonathan Franzen, 
but rather food, friends, and family.

When I asked my cousin what 

he watches on TV one day, he said, 
“Just whatever comes on. I think 
Netflix will be big in India soon, 
hopefully.”

I 
thought 
to 
myself, 
just 

as 
condescendingly, 
just 
as 

patronizingly, just as selfishly, I 
hope not.

ONE NIGHT, 
ONE PILL, ONE TRAGEDY 

—and a mother’s mission

By Lev Facher, Managing Editor

J

osh Levine’s death, examined at the simplest level, was 
the doing of a pill.

Small, round, and as visually unintimidating as an 

over-the-counter painkiller, Adderall tablet was first pre-
scribed to somebody not named Josh Levine, somebody who 
then presumably offered it to the 22-year-old at a Saturday 
night party at a Chicago apartment. Somewhere along the 
line, the pill was crushed so it could be snorted. Once ingest-
ed, it went to work promoting a sense of alertness and energy 
that kept Levine, no stranger to alcohol, completely unaware 
he was pushing himself far, far beyond his own limits with 
every sip.

Levine, a 2014 University graduate who had accepted his 

first full-time job and moved to Chicago just weeks before the 
incident, was found unresponsive on a sidewalk in the early-
morning hours of July 20, 2014. He suffered a fatal, alcohol-
induced cardiac episode while walking home alone. Someone 
had stolen his wallet from his motionless body, and Levine 
had left his phone behind at the apartment where he had been 
drinking earlier. Levine’s family doesn’t know who stole the 
wallet, or who called 911, or whether whoever stole the wallet 
and whoever called 911 is the same person. The key fob in his 
pocket that would have opened the door to the apartment he 
had moved into just days before was the hospital’s only means 

of identifying him.

Presence Saints Mary and Elizabeth Medical Center, 

located just northwest of downtown Chicago, called Levine’s 
property manager who called a family member.

Levine was declared brain-dead shortly after arriving at 

the hospital. He was taken off life support hours after his par-
ents arrived at his hospital bedside, having driven through 
the night from Cincinnati after receiving a concerned mid-
morning call from Levine’s brother, who also lived in Chica-
go, then an evening phone call that he was in the hospital, in 
the ICU, and things weren’t looking good. 

In an early morning phone call, the Cook County coroner 

asked Levine’s mother, Julie Buckner, whether her son had 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

No, Buckner said, he didn’t. Why do you ask?
He had stimulants in his system, the coroner told Buckner. 

Amphetamines. Adderall.

No, Buckner told her. He didn’t. Levine didn’t do that kind 

of thing.

The coroner already knew the facts, but said she would 

look into it further.

The hospital measured Levine’s blood toxicity upon his 

arrival. His blood alcohol content, Buckner said, was “astro-
nomical.” When he reached the hospital, he had amphet-

amines in his system. By the time he was taken off life support 
a day and a half later, the Adderall was gone, flushed out by a 
network of tubes and needles and a body that, by and large, 
was still functioning. 

Levine’s cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poison-

ing, but the records only tell a partial story. Alcohol was only 
one factor.

A pill cost Levine’s brother and three step-brothers a sib-

ling. It cost the University of Michigan a promising young 
alumnus, the school’s football team a beloved former manag-
er. It cost West Bloomfield High School a popular substitute 
teacher. It cost Buckner her son.

Josh’s brothers, Adam and Alec Buckner, graduated May, 

2015. Here they stand together on the football practice field 
the night before the Michigan-Ohio State game 2011. There 
was a managers’ game and the Michigan managers crushed 
Ohio State.

***

Stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall are commonly pre-

scribed to patients diagnosed with ADHD, a condition the 
American Psychiatric Association has stated affects 5 percent 
of American children, the population in which symptoms of 
the disorder typically first manifest.

Given the frequency with which the drugs are prescribed 

to children and their seemingly innocuous brand names, 
it can be easy to underestimate the drugs’ seriousness and 
potency.

But Ritalin has another name, too: methylphenidate. If you 

came up with a nickname for the chemical compound, “meth” 
might be a good place to start.

This relationship paints a far clearer picture of the effects 

of these drugs, which, when taken by someone who has no 
need for it, can elicit similar responses as the recreational 
drug found on street corners.

The culture surrounding prescription stimulant abuse is 

remarkably casual, some researchers say. Those seeking out 
extra pills from friends with legitimate prescriptions are 
often unaware of the intense side effects that can develop as a 
result, even in healthy patients.

“Increasingly, doctors and psychiatrists are recommend-

ing that people who are prescribed stimulants take them in 
private,” said Elizabeth Austic, a postdoctoral researcher at 
the University who has studied the use of stimulants and opi-
oids in teenage populations.

“One thing I heard a lot in college is the ‘friend code,’ — 

your friend does you a favor; you’re breaking the friend code 
if you don’t (give into their requests for a prescribed stimu-
lant),” Austic said.

Giving a friend an extra dose of a controlled substance, 

considering its potential effects, is no act of friendship. It’s 
also a felony, a factor that typically only comes into play once 
disaster has already struck. Sometimes it’s akin to what hap-
pened to Levine. Sometimes, the disaster can be a psychiatric 
one.

Even in healthy patients, amphetamines can induce psy-

chosis and other severe symptoms, according to a 2012 study 
published in BMC Psychiatry, a peer-reviewed psychiatric 
journal. More vulnerable patients, such as those with person-
al or family history of psychiatric issues, can be susceptible to 
developing symptoms even at small doses.

Symptoms for this form of psychosis can include visual 

hallucinations, insomnia, anorexia, and delusional parasit-
osis, in which victims come to falsely belief that their bodies 
are infested with parasites.

But the side effects of stimulant use, or the adverse effects 

of combining the drugs with alcohol, are often unrealized in 
users until the worst has already occurred.

Worse, Austic said, those who do suffer adverse side effects 

sometimes fall off the radar. A college student who developed 
symptoms of psychosis after taking stimulants might take a 
semester off for health reasons or drop out of college entirely, 
making it even less likely that their peers would be forced to 
come to terms with issue’s prevalence.

Instead of a college freshman learning about their room-

mates’ substance abuse issue, that freshman might simply 
find him or herself with a double room to themselves, Austic 
said.

“Growing up, whenever I heard of someone who died from 

an overdose, you don’t take it seriously, because you think, 
‘My friends aren’t like that,’ ” said Ben Eilender, a lifelong 
friend of Levine’s, a fellow football manager and 2014 Uni-
versity graduate. “All it takes is one bad decision. Or one bad 
night.”

***

Levine, a member of Theta Chi Fraternity, was the type of 

person who could be found regularly at parties and bars. He 
drank a fair amount, his friends say, but not more than any-
body else in his social circle.

Levine was as much a momma’s boy as he was a frat boy. 

He kept his mother in the loop about every aspect of his life.

“Way too much,” Buckner said with a laugh. “He told me 

way too much.”

He worked part-time at Rick’s American Cafe, a famous 

hotspot for college nightlife in Ann Arbor. Not wanting to 
choose between a raucous 21st birthday celebration and a 
night with his family, Levine settled for both: he brought his 
parents and siblings to the bar at 611 Church Street.

Levine wasn’t known for being an out-of-control type, for 

overdoing things, for being the person whose level of intoxi-
cation drew eyes from across the room.

“He’s kind of the poster child,” Buckner said. “He was a frat 

boy who could drink, but he wasn’t an alcoholic. He wasn’t a 
drug addict. By all accounts of him using Adderall, it was not 
a regular thing for him.”

Jake Miller, another University alum who was a close 

friend of Levine’s and shared a house with him in the months 
following their graduation, agreed. Levine, he said, wasn’t 
the type to have drawn attention to himself simply by having 
overindulged.

“That’s why it’s so surprising,” Miller said. “He was never 

the kid who was out of control, who you had to take care of. 
He was more likely taking care of someone else.”

While several of Levine’s friends and the University stu-

dent population at large were generally aware of the dangers 
of drinking — and maybe even held an abstract understand-
ing of the dangers of co-ingestion — such an outcome was 
unthinkable.

“I think anybody who’s lost a friend to drinking or drugs 

has had their experience change,” Miller said. “Of course you 
know it’s dangerous. You’ve heard stories. But you don’t really 
think that when you’re going out tonight, somebody could die. 
That isn’t something that occurs to you.”

***

In the aftermath of her son’s death, Buckner started the 

Josh E. Levine Foundation, a nonprofit which honors Levine’s 
memory by bringing to light the rarely discussed issue of co-
ingestion.

The organization’s slogan is ominous: “It’s Fun Until…”
The goal, Buckner says, is to save lives — to bring the issue 

close enough to home that those considering using stimulants 
or any other drug alongside alcohol think twice.

“Please don’t co-ingest ANYTHING with alcohol,” the 

foundation’s Facebook page wrote on April 14, which would 
have been Levine’s 23rd birthday. “Adderall, Xanax, Perco-
cet, Red Bull, anti-depressants, etc. Have a game plan in place 
when you drink to quit while you still have your wits.”

But Buckner isn’t fighting this issue alone. Wolverine Well-

ness, a subdivision of University Health Service, has also been 
front and center in increasing proactive efforts to prevent stu-
dents’ abuse of stimulants and sleep aids, both when they’re 
being used as sleep aids and when they’re being abused along-
side alcohol.

There’s no quick fix.
The University’s 2014 National College Health Assessment 

showed that 10 percent of undergraduate students reported 
having used amphetamines in the 12-month window before 
taking the survey, an uptick from 9 percent in 2010, the last 
year the survey was performed.

A smaller but still substantial percentage of students self-

reported having used sedatives like Xanax and Valium — 5 
percent of undergraduates in a 12-month window.

Though preventative efforts are largely important in keep-

ing a handle on campus health issues, organizations like Wol-
verine Wellness find themselves searching for a “sweet spot” 
that balances spreading awareness with the fear of lending an 
air of social acceptability to the abuse of a particular drug, 
said Wolverine Wellness director Mary Jo Desprez.

Desprez, using the hypothetical of heroin use in under-

graduates, said broadly spreading the word about abuse of a 
particular drug abuse pattern can do more harm than good.

“Even if there were only five (users on campus), you still 

want to do something,” Desprez said. “And you don’t want to 
norm it. You don’t want to do a big campus campaign that says, 
‘Don’t do heroin,’ because then all of a sudden everybody’s 
like, ‘Is everybody doing heroin?’ It’s still only five people.”

Instead, Desprez said, the University needs to be “nim-

ble enough to do those targeted interventions” on smaller 
populations of students who’ve developed an abusive habit, 
without resorting to widespread measures that essentially 
concede the commonplace nature of certain substance abuse 

patterns, like AlcoholEdu. 

At the same time, many say there’s a mentality issue on 

campus that has yet to be addressed.

“There’s two pockets of misuse,” Desprez said. “One is per-

formance aid. We have this culture here of, ‘gonna stay up all 
night, gonna write the paper, gotta focus, everybody does it.’ 
The other pocket of worry, which I think Josh fell into, is co-
ingestion with the idea of keeping the party going longer.

“I think the perception that (a stimulant is) a good study 

aid sort of dwarves the reason it’s a prescription drug. It does 
come with these huge health issues and concerns.”

A study co-authored by Sean McCabe, another University 

researcher who has studied the practice of prescription drug 
abuse and stimulant-alcohol co-ingestion, showed that male 
undergraduates were twice as likely as females to use unpre-
scribed stimulants for nonmedical reasons. White students 
were more likely to take unprescribed stimulants than any 
other racial demographic.

About 13 percent of students living in fraternity or soror-

ity houses misused prescription stimulants compared with 
about 4 percent of students living in off-campus apartments, 
according to the study.

Another study co-authored by McCabe study showed that 

6.9 percent of undergraduates self-reported having used 
abusable prescription drugs alongside alcohol in the previous 
12-month span.

Perhaps more disturbingly, the study reported, “nonmedi-

cal users of prescription stimulants were over six times more 
likely to report frequent heavy drinking than their peers who 
did not report nonmedical use of prescription stimulants.”

In other words: those who can least afford to drink heavily 

are often those who do it most. 
Josh brought his mother, Julie, to Rick’s American Cafe on his 21st birthday, April 14, 2013.
Josh’s brothers, Adam and Alec Buckner, graduated May, 2015. Here they stand together on the football 
practice field the night before the Michigan-Ohio State game 2011. There was a managers’ game and the

Professor Profile: Ed Cho

by Natalie Gadbois, Deputy Statement Editor

E

ach year, as the echoes of Welcome Week 
parties fade and the Ulrich’s line veers dan-
gerously out the door, hundreds of students 

face the same great white whale — Economics 102. 
Famous at the University for its rigor and the com-
petitive nature of its students, this class is a hall-
mark of undergraduate life at the “U.”

This year, there is one more person entering the 

hallowed ground of Lorch Hall — Econ 102’s newest 
lecturer, Edward Cho. Cho began at the University 
last year teaching 300- and 400-level econom-
ics courses, and is willing to admit the prospect of 
teaching to 370 students is a new challenge com-
pared to his past teaching experiences. At Wellesley 
College the largest class he taught had 30 students.

“At first I was worried or fearful that the classes 

would be too big, especially because I like to inter-
act with the students, but it hasn’t been a problem 
at all.”

Cho’s path to Michigan is unconventional com-

pared to many others — he began his undergrad 
career as a bio-engineer, before taking an econ 
course and “feeling everything click.” Despite this 
initial passion for economics, after graduate school 
he pursued a career in consulting.

“You don’t actually know what you like and dis-

like until you do it, and all these conceptions of 
what you think you want to do, once you get there 
you realize it’s not what you thought it was.”

In consulting, Cho soon realized the rigorous 

hours weren’t worth it for him.

“I saw people who were working in consulting, 

and they were in their 40s and 50s, and still work-
ing 100 hours a week … So I decided it was time to go 
back to what I loved to do.”

He returned to school at MIT, and taught for a 

short while there as well as at Harvard, before 
moving to Wellesley College in Massachusetts. At 
Wellesley, he became close with a professor who he 
says shaped his growth as an educator. The small 

class sizes and faculty-to-student ratio at Wellesley 
allowed him to develop a core tenet of his teaching 
philosophy — connecting with his students, a skill 
he has doubled upon since starting at the University.

“Students here like to engage, and I just have to 

find a way to do it right,” he said, “The main chal-
lenge is keeping the interaction with students high.”

During his first year at the University, Cho strove 

to make econ relevant to students — more than just 
a class taken for a grade, but as an applicable skill 
base.

Public Policy senior Harry Kammerman, who 

took ECON 396, believes Cho’s philosophy pays off 
in the classroom, saying, “He provides examples 
that are relevant to current trends in financial mar-
kets, helping students apply what they’ve learned.”

One of Cho’s favorite teaching techniques is 

introducing real-life examples into his lectures — 
he will have his pet cat play the stock market to 
explain the randomness of the success of stocks. 
He understands the esoteric nature of the topics he 
teaches, so he tries to make Econ relevant to his stu-
dents, pulling in current events and campus-related 
examples.

“Teaching has no limit … There is knowing the 

material, there is answering questions, being orga-
nized — I realized there were so many more dimen-
sions to teaching.”

Perhaps what is most unique about Cho is his real 

passion for teaching — he isn’t research-focused or 
gunning for tenure, but loves engaging with stu-
dents.

“It’s a career I enjoy,” Cho said. “I sometimes ask 

myself, ‘Would I switch jobs with anyone? Would I 
switch careers?’ But I think the answer almost inev-
itably is no … With Economics you can continue to 
learn, and that’s the fun part.”

As of yesterday, 370 new students have met Cho. 

He can’t wait to get to know each and every one of 
them.

Personal Statement: My ever-evolving identity

by Kathleen Davis, Senior Arts Editor

A

re you Hispanic/Latino? Select yes or no.

My first words were not in English. 

The way my mom tells it, out of a bab-

bling string of “goo-goos” and “ga-gas” came 
“gato,” a meaningless word in English, but the 
start of a bilingualism that came from growing 
up in a duel-cultured household. “Gato,” or “cat” 
in Spanish, was the beginning of a complicated 
relationship between my two cultures, which I 
haven’t taken control of until recently.

I’m the product of a Mexican-American 

mother and a Canadian-American (read: very 
white) father, speaking exclusively Spanish to 
the former and English to the latter during my 
formative years. My family friends and my dad’s 
relatives often tell stories from when I was a tiny 
child, having not yet differentiated what was 
English and what was Spanish, responding to 
questions asked in one language with the other, 
leaving most outside my family confused and in 
need of rapid translation. 

After entering the public school system, where 

English quickly became my dominant language, 
I held a certain pride for my diverse half, a rare 
commodity in my predominantly white home-
town where I was one of five or six kids in my 
graduating class from a Spanish-speaking house-
hold. I was the only kid on the block who had 
birthday parties with piñatas, with “happy birth-
day” and las mañanitas sung consecutively before 
I blew the candles out on my cake. My friends in 
4th grade Spanish hour called me “the human 
dictionary” for my rapidly whispered transla-
tions during quizzes. Before self-consciousness, 
my uniqueness was a source of pride.

And then struck preteen indifference.
At around 12 years old, when being different 

makes you want to blend in even more to the 
status quo, I began responding to my mother’s 
Spanish questions with English, more likely just 
a “yeah” or “no” to contribute as little to con-

versations as possible. This period didn’t last 
long, but the funny thing about language is if 
you don’t use it, you lose it. I would notice it in 
inopportune moments, like speaking with my 
grandmother or doing translations for friends. 
Blanking on an English-to-Spanish translation, 
messing up a simple grammatical structure. The 
shame of knowing I was losing the language was 
enough to perpetuate a cycle of less use at home 
and more forgetting. It’s a period of time I wish 
I could go back to just to shake Little Me out of 
that irreversible stupidity — “Stop being such a 
tonta!”

“I’m just tired,” I’d say. “My Spanish brain 

needs to be warmed up.” Partially true, but I 
never had that problem earlier in life.

What struck me worse than preteen indiffer-

ence was the constant utterance that would fol-
low after my Latina confession — “But you don’t 
look Mexican!” A phrase that seems so harmless, 
but when heard frequently can cause an identity 
crisis of cosmic proportions for a small little girl. 
I get it, I’m one of the palest girls around and my 
hair is only light brown instead of raven. But that 
simple phrase, which could easily be responded 
to with a little education about the diversity 
within the Latin@ community, burrowed so 
deep into my head that I questioned if I even was 
Mexican. Sure, I’m technically half, but was that 
enough to care about learning Spanish anymore? 
If everyone thinks I’m just a standard white girl, 
it’s not like I need to prove anything to anyone.

Again, tonta.
The looming thought that I wasn’t a Salma 

Hayek or an Eva Longoria was the catalyst for 
my middle school physical insecurities. I longed 
to look like these women, filling my days with 
streaky self tanner and Google searches for 
“How to look more Latina.” Even as a Hispanic 
woman, I conceded to the media-perpetuated 
stereotypes that plague my cultural community, 

because I was so eager to prove to the outside 
that I was one of them. And with every innocent 
“you don’t look Mexican!” I fell deeper into the 
spiral of identity crisis.

On standardized tests, where it was necessary 

to note your race and ethnicity, I always became 
glossy-eyed, staring at the questions for too long, 
wondering just how Mexican I felt today and if 
I was a faker for marking down “Hispanic.” I 
always ended up putting down “Hispanic” and 
“bilingual,” but it always came with a pang of 
guilt I could never explain.

Recovering from insecurity is not a one size fits 

all process. For some, therapy is the answer; for 
others, it’s something we learn to repress. When I 
developed issues with depression and anxiety my 
freshman year of college, I assumed they were 
triggered by the textbook examples: feelings of 
isolation, large life transitions, etc. Never did it 
cross my mind that these issues could stem from 
the deeply rooted thoughts that I was a free float-
er in life, knowing I was too white to fit with the 
Latinas and too Latina to feel comfortable being 
completely white. These feelings were exempli-
fied by the process of moving away from home 
and losing what I felt was the only tie I had to my 
diversity — my family, who I used to justify my 
Hispanic-ness.

I’m still working through these feelings of 

insecurity, but with age and education, they’ve 
gotten better. Moving away from home, though 
difficult in the sense that I felt like I was los-
ing my Mexican identity, allowed me to come in 
touch with a multitude of diverse individuals, 
many of whom identify with more than one cul-
tural identity. My identity to my two cultures is 
ever-evolving and I’m learning that that’s OK. I 
feel confident in proclaiming that I’m a Latina 
woman as I work slowly to regain the parts of my 
language I’ve lost over the years, and I’m learn-
ing to be proud of my uniqueness once again.

ILLUSTRATION BY CHERYLL VICTUELLES


“Josh wanted to be a teacher, and he wanted to be a coach,” Eilender said. 

“That’s what his mom is doing, trying to help kids, trying to save a single life. 
That’s what shines through for me the most, because that’s what Josh would 
have wanted.”

Buckner said though she certainly wasn’t obligated to publicize the manner 

in which her son died, she felt compelled to. 

“There was no question that I needed people to know what happened, 

because it was so frightening to me,” Buckner said. “I had no clue that kids were 
abusing adderall as a party drug. I did not know about this issue of co-ingestion.”

The message, whether it’s through the foundation’s work, the simple fact of 

Levine’s death, or both, is having an effect. Levine’s friends approached Buckner 
at his funeral to tell her that though they’d co-ingested previously, those days 
were over.

Others didn’t have to say a thing — Buckner said she could tell just from the 

look in their eyes. It also took her son’s death for Buckner to realize exactly the 
type of person he was — as charitable and selfless as he was, he’s also remem-
bered for being charitable and selfless in the most understated way possible.

“I can’t tell you how many girls told me that he would walk them home at 

night,” Buckner said. “That he would literally give them the coat off his back if 
they needed it. To hear that those were the type of things that he was doing was 
pretty breathtaking.

In the months before his death, Levine had worked as a substitute teachers 

at West Bloomfield High School and had thoughts of becoming a credentialed 
teacher.

“What happened to our family was cataclysmic.”
The cataclysm isn’t over. Barely a year has passed since Levine’s death, and 

Buckner knows there’s still work to be done.

“When you walk around (Michigan’s campus) on a football Saturday, it’s just 

unbelievable,” Buckner said. “Now the kids, I heard, will snort Adderall first 
thing in the morning,” allowing them to drink unimpeded throughout the day.

This Saturday, and on hundreds of Saturdays in the years to come, students 

will wake up early, and they’ll drink. Buckner isn’t much of a drinker herself. 
She’s not thrilled about the alcohol — in and of itself, the binge drinking of alco-
hol alone is its own health issue, one that isn’t discussed enough on college cam-
puses across the country.

But if Buckner has her way, maybe — just maybe — they’ll stick to alcohol, and 

have a plan to quit drinking while they still have their wits. She’s taking things 
one step at a time.
