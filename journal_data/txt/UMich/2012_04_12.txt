Coleman:
Banners
shouldn't
go back up

University can
reassociate with
'Fab Five' in 2013
By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
For the past decade, four
banners have lain dormant,
wrapped in plastic and placed
among the columns of card-
board boxes in the archives of
the Bentley Historical Library.
The banners represent one of
the pinnacles of the Michigan
men's basketball team's success.
Their resting place represents
the program's darkesthours.
And if the decision is left up
to University President Mary
Sue Coleman, that's where the
banners will remain.
"What happened was not
good, and I don't think they'll
ever go back up. I don't," Cole-
man said in her fireside chat
with students on Tuesday.
"Some day, I won't be presi-
dent anymore, and maybesome-
one else will have a different
view. But I think you have to

reflect on the larger meaning
and that we want to hold our-
selves to a higher standard."
On Nov. 7,2002,three months
into her presidency, Coleman
ordered the removal of four
banners representing two Final
Four appearances, a Big Ten
Tournament championship and
an NIT championship from the
rafters at Crisler Arena as part
of the University's self-imposed
sanctions following the biggest
scandal in the program's his-
tory.
"To me, taking down those
banners was like a dagger in my
heart," then-Athletic Director
Bill Martin told reporters that
afternoon.
The sanctions were in
response to an ongoing legal
case regarding former basket-
ball team booster Ed Martin,
who had admitted to running an
illegal gambling operation from
which he laundered money to
members of the Michigan bas-
ketball team.
The four indicted players
were headlined by legendary
"Fab Five" member Chris Web-

Lexicon lover

How did you decide you were
interested in linguistics?
I was hooked about two weeks
into my first course in linguistics
when I was a first-year student in
1985. I had intended to pursue a
path in translation and one of the
requirements of that program was
an introductory linguistics class.
As corny as this sounds, it was
really like finally arriving at the
place I'd been looking for. Once I
declared my major concentration
in linguistics, I've never wavered
in my passion for it.
What is the most rewarding.
part aboutbeing a professor?
I really like almost all aspects
of being a professor, except
maybe e-mail, but I especially

like those aspects that intertwine
working with students and work-
ing on a specific research project.
I find it intellectually stimulat-
ing to interact with students, and
especially to find ways to engage
mutually on working out puzzles,
conundrums and challenges. I
love it when students are par-
ticipating; challenging me or the
texts or data we're working with
and coming up with new ideas
and directions for further explo-
ration.
Are you involved in any type of
research or projects affiliated
with the University to further
your linguistics studies?
I'm currently working on

Two employees were injured
yesterday in a lithium battery

The explosion occurred dur-

at the Alternative Energy Center
laboratory at the GM Tech Cen-

said in a statement.
It also caused a small fire that
was quickly extinguished.

The agreement resolves claims

Controversial
launch to occur in
five-day window
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Fighter jets roared
through the skies over down-
town Pyongyang today as the
world watched to see whether
North Korea would defy inter-
national warnings and launch a
long-range rocket over the Yel-
low Sea.
The five-day window for the
launch of a rocket mounted
with an observation satellite
opened today as North Koreans
woke to details about develop-
ments at a Workers' Party con-
ference where leader Kim Jong
Un ascended to top posts and
brought with him a new genera-
tion of officials.
His father, Kim Jong II, was
granted the posthumous title of
"eternal general secretary" at
the special one-day party con-
ference yesterday. The immor-
talization of the late leader
provided a glimpse into how
North Korea will handle the
nation's second hereditary suc-
cession and indicates he will
be honored much in the same
way his father, Kim Il Sung, was
made "eternal president" follow-
ing his 1994 death.
Footage on state TV today
showed Kim Jong Un seated at
the front of the conference with
white statues of his grandfather
and a new statue of his father
in his trademark khaki work
ensemble, one arm on his hip.
There was no word this morn-
ing on the timing of the contro-
versial launch, which the North
has said will takeplacesometime
between Thursday and Monday.
In 2009, a similar launch from an
east coast site took place on the
second day of a five-day window.
The United States, Japan,
Britain and others say the launch

would constitute a provocation
and would violate U.N. Secu-
rity Council resolutions banning
North Korea from developing its
nuclear and missile programs.
Experts say the Unha-3 carri-
er is similar to the type of rocket
that could be used to fire a mis-
sile mounted with a nuclear war-
head to strike the U.S. or other
targets.
The launch and Kim's formal
ascension to top posts comes
during a week of events leading
up to celebrations Sunday mark-
ing the 100th anniversary of the
birth of his grandfather, late
President Kim Il Sung.
The centennial is a major
milestone in the nation Kim
founded in 1948, and the streets
of the capital, Pyongyang, were
awash with new posters, ban-
ners and the national flag. The
streets were busy with women
clad in traditional Korean dress-
es and children waving red flags.
North Korea invited doz-
ens of journalists to report on
the events designed not only to
honor Kim Il Sung but also to
demonstrate unity as Kim Jong
Un consolidates power. The
Taedong River flyover of fighter
jets was practice for a military
parade, officials said. North
Korea's army celebrates its 80th
anniversary later this month.
The expected satellite launch
is one of the marquee events this
week. North Korean space offi-
cials call the launch of the Unha-
3 rocket, mounted with an Earth
observation satellite, a "gift" to
Kim Il Sung. They said Wednes-
day that the final step of inject-
ing fuel into the three-stage
rocket was under way in the
coastal hamlet of Tongchang-ri.
"We are injecting fuel as we
speak," Paek Chang Ho, chief of
the space committee's General
Command Center, told report-
ers given a chance Wednesday
tovisit the controlcenter outside
Pyongyang.

Neighborhood
watchman turns
himself in
SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - The
neighborhood watch volunteer
who shot Trayvon Martin to
death had been out of touch
and, his ex-lawyer says, "a little
bit over the edge" before his
arrest on a second-degree mur-
der charge.
As George Zimmerman
turned himself in yesterday
in the Feb. 26 shooting of the
unarmed black teen, experts
offered this advice: Stop talk-
ing.
"My advice to the client
would be, 'Save it for the trial. It
can't help you."' said Roy Kahn,
a Miami defense attorney,.
The 28-year-old Sanford
man was in custody in Florida
after a puzzling disappearance
that had his lawyers express-
ing concern for his health
and Announcing they couldn't
represent him anymore. Zim-
merman had called special
prosecutor Angela Corey, his
former lawyers said, had an
off-the-record chat with a Fox
News Channel host and put up
a website asking supporters for
money.
"It would not be in a client's
best interest to give any state-
ment before it's his time to tes-
tify at trial," Kahn said. "For
him to give a statement, since
he already has given an inter-
view to the police, any addi-
tional statement at the State
Attorney's Office would just

create the possibility of him
creating conflict with his previ-
ous statements."
Zimmerman's new attorney,
Mark O'Mara, said after his
client's arrest yesterday that
Zimmerman "is very concerned
about the charges, but he is
OK."
"I'm not concerned about
his mental well being," O'Mara
said.
Former lawyers Craig Son-
ner and Hal Uhrig on Tues-
day portrayed Zimmerman as
erratic, said he hadn't returned
their calls and texts and was
buckling under the pressure
thathas built in the month since
the shooting.
Jack Schafer, a professor at
Western Illinois University
and a former FBI behavioral
analyst, said Zimmerman's
behavior shouldn't cause undue
concern. After all, Schafer said,
he wasn't charged with any
crime and was free to go wher-
ever he wanted after he spoke to
authorities after the shooting.
"If I were him, I'd go some-
where in hiding," said Schafer.
"His life is at risk, not by juris-
prudence, but by angry people
who are rushing to judgment."
Leslie Garfield, a Pace Uni-
versity law professor in New
York, said Zimmerman's behav-
ior over the last 48 hours should
not affect his prosecution.
"Whatever else goes on
behind the scenes before charg-
es aren't really a factor," she
said. "All that should matter is
what his intentions were at the
time of the shooting."
Zimmerman showed the

strain in his own words on his
website, bearing the American
flag.
"As a result of the incident
and subsequent media cov-
erage, I have been forced to
leave my home, my school,
my employer, my family and
ultimately, my entire life," he
wrote. "This website's sole pur-
pose is to ensure my supporters
they are receiving my full atten-
tion without any intermediar-
ies."
Kahn said anything Zim-
merman says now, to Corey or
the public, could be taken the
wrong way.
"The only thing he can do is
make the case worse for himself
if he says something stupid," he
said. "It may not be incriminat-
ing, but if it's stupid, even if it's
an insignificant fact that shows
it's something he lied about,
that's enough for them to say,
'Well, he's lying."'

Broad language
Arizona cyber-bullying bill isn't specific enough
Arizona residents might have to think twice before they decide
to leave a scathing comment on an inane article they read
online because that comment could soon be considered a form
of cyberbullying. An anti-cyberbullying bill that recently passed in
Arizona is extremely broad and could authorize arrests for those who
write inappropriate comments on social media and news sites. While
it's crucial that lawmakers do as much as possible to end cyberbully-
ing, a line needs to be drawn between personally harassing and emo-
tionally harming an individual and expressing one's beliefs through
digital means.


I can tell you we did not come to this decision lightly.
We do not prosecute by public pressure."
-State Attorney Angela B. Corey said yesterday after announcing that George Zimmerman is facing
charges of second degree murder for the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the Los Angeles Times reported.
The'War on Women'

The Arizona Legislature passed amend-
ments to House Bill 2549 earlier this month,
which revised the state's telephone harass-
ment law. This new language applies to a
wide variety of dialogue transmitted over
"electronic or digital communications." If
"annoying or offending" language is used,
it could send offenders to jail for up to six
months. While the amendment has good
intentions, its language is broad and full of
loopholes, making it potentially harmful to
those who engage in online discussion, limit-
ing First Amendment rights.
Cyberbullying has become increasingly.
prevalent among young people and needs to
be taken seriously. Laws like these are pro-
gressive, and aim to prevent personal harm
from occurring on the Internet. The Internet
is a space less easily controlled by parents,
so some regulations are necessary to protect
children and teenagers. However, this law
goes a step too far.
The language of this amendment contains
many loopholes, making it easy for there to
be frivolous lawsuits against minor occur-
rences. Speech formerly protected by the
Constitution will now be criminalized. For
example, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)
recently called President Barack Obama
"stupid" on Twitter. This comment could be

considered offensive and annoying, possibly
making it illegal under Arizona law. If this
law was widespread, millions of comments
like this would be illegal and many visible,
important people could be prosecuted.
This is not the first law in Arizona that is
controversial. This year, Arizona has passed
laws that limit ethnic minorities' rights and
that took overwhelmingly conservative mea-
sures such as banning ethnic studies classes
in schools. A bill was even passed that pro-
hibits medical malpractice lawsuits against
doctors who keep information from a woman
which might convince her to have an abor-
tion. These laws and others represent a prob-
lematic trend of increasingly conservative
laws being passed in Arizona.
Cyberbulling and stalking are extremely
serious issues that must be addressed. The
government has the crucial responsibility to
prevent this type of behavior, as it is hard for
parents and family members to control. How-
ever, this amendment's language is too broad,
and it limits citizens' right to free speech.
Trying to combat the serious problem of
cyberbullying is commendable, but the bill's
vague language seriously oversteps the fine
line between protecting youth from person-
ally offensive language and restraining peo-
ple's ability to express their opinions.

to typical that preceding an
election year we see an array
of national and global issues
surge to the
front of the
United States
political stage.
In the 2012
' election, I had
well anticipat-
ed some of the
issues we have SARAH
seen take prior- ROHAN
ity throughout
the campaign -
issues like healthcare, the Middle
East and the economy. However,
one issue currently dominating the
campaign that I had not foreseen is
women's health rights. Democrats
have dubbed the recent barrage of
reproductive-related laws as a "war
on women," an allegation which
Republicans assert holds as much
water as a "war on caterpillars."
Considering women comprised 53
percent of 2008 presidential elec-
tion voters, and whether or not
the 430 reproduction-related bills
proposed since January constitute
a "war on women," Republicans
should use their discretion and
make peace with women if they
want one of their own as president
in 2012.
Whether it's access to contracep-
tion, abortion or cancer screening,
a significant number of women in
this country feel as though their
rights are being assaulted. Obama
is using this sentiment of viola-
tion of women's rights to bolster
his campaign. "And people say we
should get rid of Planned Parent-
hood," Obama said on Friday to an
audience of women at the White
House. "They're not just talking
about restricting a woman's ability
to make her own health decisions.
They are talking about denying as

a practical matter the preventative
care, like mammograms, that mil-
lions of women rely on."
The message that Republicans
are denying previously guaranteed
rights to women seems to resonate
with independent female voters.
According to a March Gallup poll,
51 percent of independent female
voters in swing states say they
would vote for Obama, while only
37 percent say they would vote for
MitttRomney. Justhfour months
ago. the same poll showed Romney
leading Obama among independent
women voters by five points. So
what has changed since December?
In the wake of state-level cuts
to women's healthcare, Obama has
taken decisive action condemn-
ing these practices. In March,
the Republican-dominated Texas
Legislature announced it would
be cutting state funds to Planned
Parenthood, an organization that
provides screenings and contra-
ception and performs abortions
- which, let us not forget, are still
legal in this country. As a result of
the Texas cuts, the Obama admin-
istration said it would stop funding
Texas' Women's Health Program
if the state continued to neglect
Planned Parenthood. By contrast,
Romney supports funding cuts to
Planned Parenthood, having stated
in a television interview, "Planned
Parenthood, we're going to get rid
of that."
In addition to widespread cuts to
abortion-providing healthcare clin-
its, 15 states proposed bills this year
which would alter abortion require-
ments to discourage the proce-
dure. Most of these bills stipulate a
required ultrasound and subsequent
24-hour waiting period before the
abortion. Anti-abortion groups call
the practice "informed consent."
Those opposing the new bills call

it "a violation of the doctor-patient
relationship" since the bills compel
doctors to behave in a way which,
may not coincide with the doctors'
own professional opinion. So far, ver-
sions of the bill have passed in Texas,
Virginia and Kentucky.
Many females
think their rights
are being abused.

MAX HELLER I
Keep all options on the table

s is a mover

In a speech to the American Israel Pub-
lic Affairs Committee last month, President
Barack Obama emphasized that all options
must remain on the table in order to prevent
Iran from developingnuclear weapons. He has
also continuously stressed that the world must
give economic sanctions a chance to curb Iran's
nuclear ambitions before any potential military
action is discussed. It's critical to recognize
that while American efforts to impose sanc-
tions have been admirable, the idea of sanctions
necessitate full international cooperation in
order to realize their intended impact.
Oftentimes, commentators are critical of
sanction skeptics who doubt that they will
effectively dissuade Iran from developing a
nuclear weapon. It's presumed that these skep-
tics desire an armed military conflict with Iran
and are chastised as beingthe same "hawks that
got the United States into Iraq." That miscon-
ception couldn't be further from the truth. The
reservation thatmany harbor about sanctions is
not that they can't or won't work. Rather, the
lack of cooperation around the implementation
of sanctions means that we may never witness
their intended impact.
This rationale is ever-present in Israeli
Defense Minister Ehud Barak's assessment of
the situation. Barak surmised on CNN that the
"tightest possible sanctions ... should be ratch-
eted in a way thatwilleffectively corner (Iran)."
Barak lacks confidence in the current
level of sanctions, but does believe that with
enough cooperation, sanctions may have
a shot at curbing Iran's nuclear ambition.
Hence, it is increasingly troubling to watch
China and Russia hesitate to adopt the same
type of stiff sanctions imposed by the United
States and embraced by the European Union.
While the U.S. and EU members have taken
steps to prevent businesses based in their
countries from engaging in trade with Iran,
two of the world's largest economic behe-
moths continue to provide a lifeline to Teh-
ran, even though it's increasingly clear that
the Iranian nuclear program poses a signifi-
cant threat to the world community.
Some Chinese and Russian businesses have
decided on their own that it's a wise decision

to halt trade with Iran. Take for example,
China P&I Club, a ship insurer that had, until
recently, provided indemnity cover for tank-
ers carrying Iranian oil exports. Due to the
sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the E.U.,
China P&I Club found that it was one of the
only players left in a market in which operat-
ing as such poses a large amount of financial
risk. Thus, they decided to halt providing
such coverage.
While the example of the China P&I Club
may leave us feeling warm about the potential
for sanctions to realize their intended impact,
imagine how much more effective the effort
would be if such action was mandated by the
Chinese and Russian governments the same
way the U.S. and E.U. have done. All ship insur-
ers would immediately exit the Iranian market,
depriving ships of coverage and thus cutting off
Iranian oil exports.
Unfortunately, such isolation of Iran is
unlikely to be realized due to China and Rus-
sia's refusal to fully adopt sanctions. Thus,
when Israel and the U.S. discuss leaving all
options on the table vis-a-vis Iran, it's not a
position taken by choice. The only reason
they are forced into discussing the possibil-
ity of armed conflict is because other critical
players have already chosen their position:
they would rather allow the development of
a nuclear Iran than participate in a compre-
hensive sanctions process.
Some critics argue that the best way to
handle Iran is to hold diplomatic talks with-
out preconditions in order to dissuade the
Iranians from pursuing a nuclear weapon.
However, people like Clare Lopez, a former
CIA operations officer and presently a senior
fellow at the Center for Security Policy, rec-
ognize that such a tactic plays into the hands
of Iran, as it will enable them to continue
kicking the can down the road and running
out the clock in pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
Lopez is scheduled to visit the University on
April 15 at the Ford School of Public Policy to
discuss the most effective strategies to pre-
vent Iran from going nuclear.

N o justice!" I called out.
"No peace!" hundreds
of voices shouted
back. We refuse to be silent - now,
more than ever,
we must act.
On Tuesday,
hundreds of my
peers and com-
munity members
took a stand for
justice as part
of the Million
Hoodie March-
es that have YONAH
been occurring LIEBERMAN
across the coun-
try over the past
six weeks after
George Zimmerman killed Trayvon
Martin on Feb.26.
A lot of things have been writ-
ten about this case. I can't shed new
light on the facts or clarify things
any more clearly than they already
are. This is not a complicated issue
- it's an issue of justice.
Zimmerman - who just yester-
day was finally charged with mur-
der and taken into custody - felt
threatened by Martin because of
the outrageously outdated stereo-
types surrounding young black
men. These stereotypes are per-
petuated by media outlets and our
country's institutions.
I write this as a privileged white
man, who has never been confronted
with such dehumanizing stereo-
types. Patrick Parkinson, an LSA
junior, is a black male who helped
organize the march and spoke after-
wards. He said that each time a white
woman walks by him at night and
clutches her purse closer to her, the
feeling is like a stab to his heart.
I will never feel that pain.
What I can feel is the pain of
a deep injustice. Not just at the
murder itself, but at the police and
state's slow response to the murder.
I do not want my children grow-
ing up ina world where their friends
could be killed based on the color of

their skin. I refuse to leave the fight-
ing just to those who are directly
affected by our society's backwards
value system. I feel compelled to join
in the movement to bring Zimmer-
man to justice and expose the flawed
institutions that our country is built
around for whatthey are.
The march was a great first step.
We walked down major streets with
plenty of onlookers and got plenty
of attention. It was empowering to
walk among the bystanders, know-
ing that we walk for justice.
The most inspiring moment
came near the end of the march. As
we marched through the narrow
walkway between Randall Library
and West Hall, our chants echoed
back at us. "What do we want?"
"Justice!" "When do we want it?"
"Now!" This refrain has been used
thousands of times, around the
world, in many different languag-
es, for decades. With the echo, we
seemed to be engulfed within the
glorious history of activism.
But it does not end here. We
know that a march is just a march
if there is no attempt to make it part
of a movement.
After the equally unjust state-
sponsored assassination of Troy
Davis in Georgia on Sept. 21, 2011,
there were small-scale protests on
campus and across the country. I
now view that time as a crucial les-
son in this work. It taught me the
need for sustainability and targets.
There are three targets at play
here:
First, the laws. Loose gun laws
and supposed "Stand Your Ground"
laws are at the root of the institu-
tional problems that have led to
reckless homicides without cause
all across the country. Like Florida,
Michigan also has a "Stand Your
Ground" law, HB 5143. This law
removes the legal duty to retreat
from a situation and allows people
to use lethal force when feeling
threatened. Because of the loose
interpretations this law permits,

We have also seen media scandals
provoked by right-wing figures like
Rush Limbaugh, who found himself
in hot water after calling a law stu-
dent who advocated for insurance-
covered birth control a "slut" The
incident has undoubtedly contrib-
uted to a sense that there is a "war
on women," among those in favor of
women's reproductive rights.
Although the various attacks on
women's health-related actions have
been a disturbing trend the last few
months, calling these measures a
"war on women" may be pushing
it. However, as long as Democrat-
ic supporters continue to defend
women's rights against the Repub-
lican's alleged "war on women,"
semantics do not matter. Romney,
the presumptive Republican nomi-
nee (especially in light of yesterday's
announcement from the Santorum
campaign), must step in and make a
grand gesture to promote women's
health rights. If he and his party
don't, the Republicans will lose the
war for the White House.

nent
several systematically oppressed
members of society are the likely
victims of these homicides simply
because of the color of their skin
and the clothing they are wearing.
Students and community activists
are already going through the pro-
cess to get a proposition to repeal
the law on the ballot in November.
Real change "
can't happen
overnight.
Second, our campus community.
"Stand Your Ground" laws are made 0
worse by stereotypes that society
holds. These stereotypes - as have
been repeatedly and publicly stated
- continue to be used on this cam-
pus against students of color. We
should hold seminars, trainings and
workshops in order to combat these
stereotypes head on with education
and dialogue.
Third, our administration. The
complete and utter lack of diversity
on this campus contributes to igno-
rance and apathy. The only way to
change this is through the adminis-
tration. Students from the Coalition
for Tuition Equality and eRACism
will once again demonstrate before
the University's Board of Regents at
their monthly meeting. Join us at 2
p.m. on April 19th at the Cube for a
rally before the meeting.
We need a sustainable movement
to create real change. It cannot hap-
pen overnight. These are not the
only targets, but they are at least
a starting point. And we must get
started.

"In the Michigan Senate, if
someone moves for immedi-
ate effect, they actually count
the vote and make sure there is
a two-thirds majority," Irwin
said. "In the House of Repre-
sentatives, there is a longstand-
ing practice of not counting the
votes ... immediate effect has just
become a routine in the Legisla-
ture."
Irwin said Democrats have
been exasperated to the point of
physical objection on the floor to
the motion of immediate effect.
"We made (a call for a roll call
vote) in writing, we made it ver-
bally, we tried jumping up and
down on the House floor and
waving our arms to try and get

said.

BIRDS
From Page 1A
O Foighil, director of the Muse-
um of Zoology, said the shipment
is important because there are not
many Hawaiian Birds in the Uni-
versity's collection, as compared
to from other locations. He added
the vast majority of extinctions
have happened on the Pacific
Islsnd, and studying the birds

Newell's Shearwaters.
"The neat thing about these
specimens is that you can get
insights into all aspects of their
biology," 6 Foighil said.
O Foighil said the collections
in the Museum of Zoology have
a "global frame of reference,"
despite its midwestern location.
Two thirds of the world's species
of birds are represented in the
collection, and the set has a large
sampling of birds from South
Asia, Africa and North America.

Appeals.
Irwin said though both par-
ties have moved for immediate
effect when they held the major-
ity, the process has begun to be
abused in matters that heavily
influence Michigan citizens.
Irwin cited the GSRA union-
ization ban, passed Feb. 21, and
the domestic-partner benefits
ban, passed Dec. 22, as immedi-
ate effect legislation that passed
without a two-thirds majority.
Ari Adler, Bolger's press sec-
retary, said the practice of imme-
diate effect has been in place for
many years and has not provento
be problematic.
"(The House Republicans)
believe we will prevail in the
lawsuit," Adler said. "The pro-
cedures we follow in the House
are constitutional, they follow
the House rules and they follow
longstanding precedent through-
out the legislative history."
Adler said House Democrats
are attempting to politicize a leg-
islative tradition by turning to
legal action.
"The House Democrats are
trying to score political points

by raising this as an issue when
it really hasn't been one for
decades," Adler said.
According to Adler, 98 per-
cent of the legislation passed in
the previous term from 2009 to
2011, under a Democratic major-
ity, was passed under immediate
effect.
Adler said immediate effect
has become necessary since
the legislative session has was
expanded after 1963, delaying
important legislation from going
into law.
"Because we have sessions
now that go all the way through
the year, if you were to pass a
bill this week, for example, and
it did not go under immediate
effect, it would not go into effect
until almost a year later," Adler
said.
Adler said there is no issue in
the use of immediate effect in
the House and all regulations are
being followed.
"We don't see anything
wrong with the way the votes
have been handled; they follow
the constitution and the House
rules."

DINGELL
From Page 1A
called the environment the most
central issue to his campaign.
After learning about the amount
of pollutants emitted by an aver-
age coal plant and the lack of
accountability placed on plant
owners by the government, he
said he believes that manufactur-
ing plants should be charged not
just for carbon emissions, but also
for mercury and lead emissions.
"Everybody in the environ-
mental movement knows that
Dingell is not with them, but he
likes to pretend that he is," Mar-
cin said. "That's just the way
that he's been forever."
Marcin noted thathis decision
to enter the race also stemmed
from his desire to reform the tax
code, which he claims "needs to
take a bath." One reform propos-
al Marcin offered was the option
for taxpayers to write in direc-
tions for how 20 percent of their
taxes should be spent.
"I don't know of any other
Congressman that wants to give
that power to ordinary people,"
Marcin said. "I've never heard
that proposed, and that's anoth-
er idea that I don't think people
are against - I just don't think
they've ever even considered it."
Marcin said he cast himself as
a political outsider whose ideas,
including the proposal for mer-
cury and lead emissions taxes,

were not derived from either
Democratic or Republican plat-
forms or ideals.
Referring to Dingell's per-
ceived status as the Dean of
the House of Representatives,
Marcin said he doesn't believe
Dingell does an adequate job
supporting working families.
"You can go to his website,
right there, right in your face
it says 'Fighting for Michigan's
Working Families,"' Marcin
said. "That doesn't mean any-
thing to me."
Zinnia Kallabat, an admin-
istr or for Dingell's campaign,
refuted Marcin's charge that
Dingell's promise to fight for the
families of Southeast Michigan
is meaningless.
"Whether it is affordable
health care, protecting Medi-
care from Republican attempts
to replace it with a voucher sys-
tem, making sure our food is safe
and our water is clean, or fight-
ing to bring jobs to our region,
the well-being of the families
of Michigan is his top prior-
ity," Kallabat wrote in an e-mail
interview.
Kallabat also denied the
notion that Dingell has mar-
ginally considered issues of
pollution, climate change and
contamination of the Great
Lakes. In his 57 years in Con-
gress, Dingell has held oil com-
panies responsible for spills,
authored the Clean Air Act and
pushed forward the cleanup of

the Detroit River, according to
Kallabat.
"Protecting our environ-
ment and making sure we have
a secure energy future are and
have been critical issues for
Congressman Dingell," she
wrote. "In Southeast Michigan,
you can see the impact from his
leadership."
Dingell's opponent in the
2002 Democratic primary elec-
tion was Lynn Rivers, a four-
term incumbent in Congress
who landed in Dingell's district
due to state redistricting follow-
ing the 2000 Census. Dingell
defeated Rivers by a margin of
59 percent to 41 percent.
His most recent challenge in
the general election was in 2010,
when he defeated Ann Arbor
cardiologist Rob Steele with 56
percent of the vote. After con-
ceding defeat, Steele said the
vote was closer than he had
anticipated.
Though Marcin said his can-
didacy is "a long shot," Kallabat
wrote that Dingell is not brush-
ing off Marcin's chances.
Marcin said he is hopeful
because he believes Ann Arbor
could be receptive to a candi-
date who is attentive to environ-
mental issues and supportive of
same-sex marriage.
"Here's my question: At the
end of the day, what's John
Dingell going to do in his 30th
term that he couldn't do in his
first 29?" he asked.


wants to study in the future,"
Hinshaw said.
Newell's Shearwaters spend
most of their adult lives at sea,
and only return to the Hawaiian
island of Kaua'i to breed and incu-
bate their eggs. The birds are cur-
rently listed as endangered on the
International Union for Conser-
vation of Nature Red List, which
aims to determine the conserva-
tion status of many species.
Bird Division Collection Man-
ager Janet Hinshaw said the birds
eat food in the ocean during the
day and fly back to their burrows
at night during egg incubation,
noting they sometimes get dis-
tracted by the bright lights and
end up crashing to their death.
Hinshaw said she specifically
had to request the specimens
from the FWS, since the service
keeps useful specimens for only
a limited amount of time before
destroyingthem.
"The only way to keep (the
specimens) alive for scholarly
work indefinitely is through a
research museum," 6 Foighil said.
6 Foighil noted that the muse-

um has specimens that date back
to the 1830s that allow for contin-
ued academic study.
"We don't know what people
are goingto be doing in the future,
so that's why we tryto save things
in as many different forms as pos-
sible," Hinshaw said.
Hinshaw said she preserved
the specimens as both round skins
and flat skins. Ina round skin, the
innards and the majority of the
bird's bones are taken out and the
skin is dried and stuffed with cot-
ton to allow study and measure-
ment of the size, girth and length
of the specimen. Ina flat skin, the
innards are also taken out, but
the bones within one wing and
one leg are left complete, and the
bird is preserved with one wing
stretched out. This allows the
form and length of a specimen's
wing to be studied.
She added that the skull and
most of the skeleton is also pre-
served for study, and that a small
tissue sample for DNA analysis
and wing clippings for isotope
analysis were also taken from the
specimens.

the application to have "extreme
speed and simplicity," addingthat
beta users have contributed sev-
eral suggestions on how people
can utilize Fetchnotes, including
ways to count calories and com-
pile notes for a book.
Schiff said he got the idea for
Fetchnotes after the notes on
his BlackBerry memo pad were
deleted one day and not retriev-
able since they were only saved
to his phone and no other exter-
nal services. Schiff talked to his
peers, and his mission for a bet-
ter mobile phone note service
became viable for mass consump-
tion.

So far, Schiff said the project
has been "bootstrapped" and
has very little funding. Despite
the financial challenges, look-
ing ahead, Schiff and Horak said
they'd like to have the application
take on a "freemium" format, in
which users can access the pro-
gram's basic functions free of
charge, but also have the option
to pay for additional features.
Schiff and Horak added that
they're looking forward to fund-
ing models that involve garnering
potential advertising opportuni-
ties from businesses.
"There's a lot of people that
want to sell business ideas, but
you would be very hard-pressed
to find someone who wants to buy
one," Schiff said.

ber (1991-93). Joining Webber
were Maurice Taylor (1993-97),
Robert "Tractor" Traylor (1995-
98) and Louis Bullock (1995-99).
An ensuing NCAA ruling
imposed a bevy of restrictions and
sanctions on the basketball pro-
gram, capped by a 10-year forced
disassociation between the Uni-
versity and the four players and
the teams they represented. That
10-year period ends in 2013.
"From my point of view, tak-
ing the banners down was the
right thing to do because it was a
very difficult time for the Univer-

sity and we were ashamed of what
happened because the University
has higher standards than that,".
Coleman said. "We're the Univer-
sity of Michigan - that shouldn't
happen."
Coleman's contrast those made
by former University President
James Duderstadt, who held that
position during the Fab Five's
Final Four runs in 1992 and 1993.
In anticipation of an ESPN doc-
umentary featuring the Fab Five
released last March, Duderstadt
told Yahoo that if he were still the
University's president, he would
"certainlytry to find a way" to put
the bannersback up.
"The players themselves, I don't
think (they) caused us any harm

at all," Duderstadt said of the Fab
Five. "I don't think it was a good
idea to pull down the NCAA ban-
ners or try to hide the seasons. I
view them as a positive part of the
University's history."
Within the documentary itself,
though, Coleman and Athletic
Director Dave Brandon stood
steadfast that the University
should not raise the banners once
the 10-year separation ends.
Brandon said the University
would be injuring its image by
turning a blind eye to a gambling
and money-laundering scandal,
even if it's a decade old.
The effect of that decision,
though, is that the actions of four
players spoiled the legacy of a long

string of Michiganteams and indi-
vidual players. Webber's Fab Five
teammate Jalen Rose produced
the ESPN documentary in hopes
of boosting the image of the scan-
dal-ridden program. But it hasn't
changed the University adminis-
trators' minds.
"The reality is that it's a team
sport," Brandon said in the docu-
mentary. "The team wins together
and the team loses together and
the team is accountable together.
"Do I think it's fair to (the play-
ers) individually? No. Do I think
it's the only way we can handle it
institutionally? Yes."
Brandon said the University
had apologized for its actions dur-
ing the 1990s, and he asked that

Webber do the same. Webber has
not yetcommented and didn't con-
tribute to the Fab Five report.
Coleman determined that the
scandal was on a larger scale than
just the basketball program - it
was University-wide.
"That was my analysis - that
the higher-ups who should have
known didn't ask questions - and
it damaged the University and the
program for a very long time,"
Coleman said Tuesday.
Brandon was unavailable for
comment on Wednesday and has
not publicly commented on the
topic since last March.
The decision regarding wheth-
er to raise the banners once again
has not yet been discussed by the

Athletic Department or the Uni-
versity administration, though it
remains to be seen whether the
NCAA would even allow Michi-
gan to raise banners in 2013 that
are notofficially recognized.
Until then, the banners will sit,
as they have for the past decade,
placed on a shelf beside a nonde-
script cardboard box, each plastic
roll bearing a one-line description:
1992 NCAA FINAL FOUR
BANNER
1993 NCAA FINAL FOUR
BANNER
For now, they remain dusty, for-
bidden and forgotten.

Wolverines lose second straight 'M'working too hard

By ISABELLAACHENBACH
Daily Sports Writers

This was supposed to be an
easy win. Instead, the Michigan
baseball team lost decisively to
Toledo, 6-2, at Ray Fisher Stadium
yesterday evening.
Start-
ing on the W. MICHIGAN 1
mound for MICHIGAN 0
the Wolver-
ines was junior right-hander Ben
Ballantine, who statistically could
be considered the best Michi-
gan pitcher this season. Between
him, senior right-hander Brandon
Sinnery and redshirt junior left-
hander Bobby Brosnahan, Ballan-
tine has the lowest ERA, 3.40. He
hasn't been tagged with a loss yet
this season, and he's struck out a
team-high 33 batters.
But lately, the Napa, Calif.
native hasn't been playing as well
as his numbers indicate.
Two weekends ago, the Wol-
verines matched up against Min-
nesota in a three-game series.
Ballantine started on the mound
on the final day of the series, but
he was taken out after a mere two
innings pitched. In those two
innings, he gave up four hits and
three runs, two of which were.
earned.
Last weekend fared similarly
for Ballantine. Once again, he
started the conclusion of the
three-game series, and once
again, he was pulled out early.
Pitted against Michigan State, he
lasted L2 innings and gave up four
hits and three earned runs.
Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney gave him another chance in
Wednesday's game against Tole-
do, but continuing the pattern,
he was taken out after only two
innings. But this time, he pitched
nearly flawlessly, giving un iust

' Â°

AUSTEN HUFFORD/Daily
Redshirt sophomore pitcher Logan McAnallen allowed no runs in five innings.

one hit and no runs.
"Ballantine did alright," Malo-
ney said. "Webelieved in him. The
first five or six games he pitched,
he had quality starts."
After two scoreless innings,
Maloney inserted redshirt senior
right-hander Kolby Wood for Bal-
lantine, and then made another
switch, putting junior right-hand-
er Kyle Clark on the mound.
Toledo (4-5 MAC, 15-18 overall)
quickly added four runs - three
off of Wood - to the scoreboard.
The Wolverines (2-4 Big Ten,
15-19 overall), responded to Tole-
do's lead with one run, scored by
freshman shortstop Dylan Del-
aney after senior third baseman
John Lorenz got a hit to left field.
But Maloney shook things up
once more and decided to pitch
redshirt sophomore left-hander
Logan McAnallen, who allowed
no runs in five innings.
"My big goal tonight was to
limit freebies: walks and hits by
pitches," McAnallen said. "I made
that a priority, and that's what I
did. In the past. that's where I've

gotten in trouble, when I just give
things away."
Freshman right fielder Zach
Zott, who has started in the past
five games, is another one of those
players who is stepping up.
"We weren't even sure if we
were going to be able to keep him
on the roster, from a numbers
standpoint," Maloney said.
"We knew he was going to
be a talent in the future, but we
thought maybe he was going to
redshirt. But he just kept getting
better and better, and we said 'No,
we've got to keep that guy.' And
he's getting his opportunity now.
I really think he's going to be a
star."
One of the team's other stars,
freshman outfielder Will Drake,
injured his ankle while running,
to first base in the bottom of the
fourth.
"I don't know the extent of it,
but he was hurt pretty bad when
he was coming off, soI have a feel-
ing he's out for awhile," Maloney
said.
The number of olavers with

injuries are stacking up. Wood has
been injured for the past two sea-
sons. Every time Maloney tries to
play him, like in yesterday's game,
he is taken out almost immedi-
ately.
"He's fighting hard to come
back, and he just hasn't been able
to yet," Maloney said. "No one
hurts more than he does. We all
root for him because he works so
hard."
Junior outfielder Michael
O'Neill has sat out the past five
games due to a thumb injury that
he sustained diving for a ball
against Central Michigan last
week. It's unclear when he will be
able to return to the plate.
"The bottom line is, we've got
to play good defense with all the
guys that are injured," Maloney
said. "We're not an offensive jug-
gernaut now. Three of our best
players are out."
Maloney subbed freshman
catcher Kevin White in for Drake
in the top of the fifth. He also used
redshirt freshman right-hander
Jay Perry and then senior right-
hander Kevin Vangheluwe on the
mound for the final inning.
Freshman infielder Mike Doll-
off got an RBI in the eighth, but
Toledo ended the game's scoring
in the ninth with a home run that
brought in two players.
It was a disappointing loss for
Michigan.
"I was predicting we would
win," McAnallen said. "It sucks
to drop these midweeks that we
need to get us in the groove going
into the weekend."
Though yesterday's loss was
unexpected, the team is gearing
up for its face-off with Penn State
this weekend.
"We don't want to lose any
games, but the reality is, it's all
about the Big Ten," Maloney said.

to fill in after injuries

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
There are several reasons
to explain the Michigan base-
ball team's two midweek losses:
too many errors, a lack of hit-
ting, inconsistent relief pitching,
etc. Yet Wolverines' coach Rich
Maloney feels his squad's down-
fall may stem from a less obvious
problem: too much effort.
"I think everyone's trying
so hard, and that's the problem
- the other guys try to do too
much," Maloney said.
The team has suffered due to
injuries to sophomore right field-
er Michael O'Neill, junior short-
stop Derek Dennis, and freshman
left fielder Will Drake.
"And now with (them) out of
the lineup, (we) just have to relax
and let the game come to them
rather than putting that much
pressure on themselves."
O'Neill, who missed both
games this week, sustained a
bruised left hand after diving for
a ball in Sunday's loss to Michi-
gan State. The sophomore out-
fielder has been one of the only
consistent hitters for Michigan,
batting .322 with 37 hits on the
season. The Wolverines' starter at
shortstop last season, Dennis, has
missed the majority of this year
with an arm injury. Dennis' most
recent action for Michigan was in
a series against Indiana-Purdue
Fort Wayne, when he entered the
game as a pinch runner.
The injury bug took another
Wolverine during yesterdays's
matchup against Toledo, when
Drake went down with a lower-
leg injury after speeding down

the first base line. Drake, who
has undoubtedlybeen Michigan's
most impressive freshman, leads
the team with 43 hits.
The injury bug has forced the
youth of the Wolverine squad to
step up both on the mound and
at the plate. Maloney has utilized
the midweek games as an oppor-
tunity to test out Michigan's
young talent, but he believes the
increased pressure may be hurt-
ing the team.
"We're making strides, and
we're improving - we don't have
as many strikeouts as we used to
have," said redshirt sophomore
second baseman John DiLaura.
"We need to try and hit more
groundballs and more line drives,
because lazy pop ups are easy
outs at the college level.'
In Wednesday's loss to the
Rockets, Michigan's bats fell
silent without O'Neill, and even
more so after Drake's departure.
The Wolverines had nine hits in
the game but left 14 runners on
base. The team squandered sever-
al opportunities to take the lead,
but they were unable to get the
"timely hit" Maloney has stressed
all season. One such chance came
in the bottom of the eighth, when
senior catcher Coley Crank ilied
out with the bases loaded to fin-
ish the inning.
It's apparent that the losses of
O'Neill and Drake in the lineup
will hurt the Wolverines' hitting
production, but the team can't
bear the entire weight of such
injuries as they attempt to find
replacements for the sluggers.
"With all the guys who ark:
injured, we're not an offensive'
juggernaut," Maloney said.

Integrating a dedication to
their sport with a dedication to
their faith, a group of student-
athletes at Michigan have found
a common bond through Ath-
letes in Action, an organization
found at Michigan and many
other campuses worldwide.
Founded in 1966 as a ministry
of Campus Crusade for Christ
International, this global orga-
nization centers on building a
spiritual community among ath-
letes. AIA meets every Wednes-
day evening in the training room
of Canham Natatorium.
Kinesiology junior Craig Roh,
a defensive end on the Michigan
football team, discussed the sup-
port he's found in AIA and how
his faith is the foundation for his
lifestyle as a disciplined athlete.
"AIA is a place where I've
found the support of other
Christian athletes - they helped
me through my walk of life and
through the tough times," Roh
said. "It's a great community to
share about what's going on in
your life. We all have problems,
but we accept God's grace and
don't have to hide things from
each other."
The Scottsdale, Ariz. native
also described his faith as "irre-
placeable."
"Every day onthe field I give it
all that I have within me, other-
wise it would be as though I was
throwing my gifts back in God's
face and saying that his gifts
aren't good enough," Roh said.
"That's the mentality that drives
me to improve every day. I see
football as a talent God has given
me, and so it's what he wants me
to do. My faith deconstructs my
fears so I can play with reckless
abandonment.
"I am a perfectionist by
nature, and I have a fear of fail-
ure that stunts my growth. I find
strength through my faith in
Jesus. Ican fail in certain things
because I'm a sinner, but I can
play with motivation that only
Gnda ~-~vicPG -"

Athletes in Action meets every Wednesday evening at Canham Natatorium.

Kinesiology senior Ben Cro-
nin, a volunteer student assis-
tant and former member of the
Michigan men's basketball team,
also credited AIA with offering
him a stable support group with
athletes of similar passions.
"My faith has been a big moti-
vation for me," Cronin said. "I
practice my sport in the same
way I study my Bible - to the
best ability and with a pure heart
with everything I have."
Cronin played for two years
under Michigan coach John
Beilein before a hip injury forced
him to discontinue his basket-
ball career.
"We're not always going to
win, but I've found my identity
in my relationship with God, not
my sport," Cronin said.
LSA senior Tim Bergsma, who
plays goalie on the Michigan
men's soccer team, lauded AIA's
ability to give a voice to Chris-
tian athletes everywhere, as well
as to help them grow and have a
lasting effect on the community.
"It's a cool avenue for finding
a community of people with sim-
ilar faith who understand the
rigors of sports as well, and it's
a chance to use the unique plat-
form of a college athlete to be
able to share my faith to people
outside of Michigan," Bergsma
said.
A T AA hnchilt n nrecenn~

among athletes in 85 countries
and on more than 100 campuses
in the United States. The pro-
gram at Michigan was estab-
lished in the mid-1970s.
Bruce Dishnow, an AIA staff
member at Michigan, detailed
several opportunities afforded
to athletes for outreach through
AIA. The group traveled to
Orlando over spring break last
year and then to Los Angeles
earlier this year.
Twenty-five students went to
Orlando for what they titled an
"Urban Immersion." The group
partnered with Here's Life
Intercity, an intercity ministry
in Orlando, to serve urban com-
munities on five different work
sites.
This spring, the group part-
nered with AIA at USC and
served at five different minis-
try sites, including Skid Row
and Nickerson's Gardens in Los
Angeles.
These were places where gang
activity and other challenges
within the community existed.
Their mission was to bring about
change in under-resourced com-
munities.
"We want to have a caring
community and safe environ-
ment for student-athletes to
explore - it has had a positive
influence on their lives, on and
nff te f ild" rnnom sad

"Athletes are in the public eye
and are role models for young
people. Although many athletes
are considered heroes to soci-
ety, we want people to see that
AIA athletes look up to Christ as
their hero."
.LSA senior Erik Braun, a
member of the Michigan men's
track and field team, emphasized
the impact Dishnow had on him
and many other athletes, and
how the AIA experience overall
has been a blessing.
"Before I came to AIA, Bruce
sought me out and invited me,"
Braun said. "He's been a mentor
for me for the last two years. The
spring break trip (to Los Ange-
les) was my first service trip, and
it gave us a chance to give back
and see work the Lord is doing in
California.
"I didn't start my walk of
faith until 2010, my sophomore
year, but now all that I do is for
God - I have an audience of one.
And it's not just something I just
think about, it's what I believe
for myself."
Bergsma and Cronin both
took part in the Los Angeles trip,
which included a week of help-
ing out at a community center for
children. During one afternoon,
the 7-foot Cronin made the mis-
take of lifting one kid up to dunk.
When he turned around, there
was a line of 20 kids patiently
waiting for their turn.
"I had to take few breaks,"
Cronin said, laughing.
Michigan hockey captain
Luke Glendening said he appre-
ciated that through AIA, he
gained a respect for people with
different beliefs.
"My advice is to find your
niche and find people who have
same interest as you but also
branch out," Glendening said.
"I have met people of other
faiths who have been an encour-
agement to me through their
strength and commitment.
"We can be encouraged by
people who are like-minded
but need to recognize and learn
from the commitment that oth-

MEN'S BASKETBALL
The striking finality of Stu
and Zackts farewell

O Tueday night at the
Michigan men's baaket-
ball team banquet, Zack
N'ovak tepped tn the pndium.
He followed teammate, cn-
captain and
three-year
roomnmate
Stu Douglass,
whose 18-min-
ute speech
gave anec-
dote-laden
thank youa to
former team- NEAL
mates, current ROTHSCHILD
teammates,
coaches, train-
ers, family members, super fans
and Crisler Center ushers.
Novak was quick to mock
Douglass and started his speech
by thanking his childhood dog,
Hoser.
It seemed as though Novak
was once again downplayingcthe
gravity of the moment. On his last
night assa Wolverine, it was his
final chance as a player to address
the Michigan public, which saw
him transform from unheralded
recruit to cornerstone of the pro-
gram..
All year, Novak was hardly
fazed by the sentimentality of his
last go-round. He scoffed when
reporters asked him about the
pressure and urgency of being a
senior, or about his last Big Ten
game, or his last home game at
Crisler.
But in his final address, he shed
his "cool' outer layer. He talked
about how he dreamed of becom-
ing aBig Ten basketball player,
and how his mom joined him for
5-on-5Spick-up games when he
was in third grade.
Novak then delivered perhaps
the most poignant line of his last
four years.
"Then that one day you dreamt
about as a kid, it happens. You
have that day, it comes, and that
day you dreamt about was yes-

Vintage isthe name of the fash-

can compare to the sheer size,

Though many students see
* it first and foremost as a great
a place to find a deal for an "ugly

warehouse-sized facility is
chock-full of amazing everyday

Stucchi's

If you don't like having dia-
betes, dying from heart and/or
liver disease or acquiring the
multitude of cancers scientifi-
cally linked to eating red meat
and deep-fried anything, stay
far, far away from Blimpy Burg-
er. If you like polite, "we value
our customers" service and
change that doesn't suck/fits
in a vending machine (not half
dollars), also stay away from
Blimpy Burger.
If you like your service with
snark instead of a smile, think
that strange money nobody uses
is fun and, most importantly,
like your food drenched in gal-
lons of greasy "good for you" oil,
head to the "oldest hamburger
stand in Ann Arbor." The menu

offers "other sandwiches &
goodies," but really, they only
offer burgers, fries and other
forms of deep-fried "cheaper
than food" sustenance, unless
you're willing to tolerate tor-
rents of abuse from the staff.
Then again, they're not
mocking you because they like
to. Well, maybe they do. But if
you're ordering anything other
than their juicy, delectable piles
of freshly ground beef, and pair-
ing that with an order of some-
thing that isn't their delectably
deep-fried mixed vegetables
(like tempura but not as unjusti-
fiably expensive), get out of line
and leave Blimpy to the profes-
sionals.

It's hard to grasp Ann Arbor's
love for Stucchi's until you're
standing in line for free ice cream
at Ben & Jerry's and you see peo-
ple sitting inside Stucchi's eat-
ing exactly the same dessert they
could have gotten for free only a
few feet away.
Correction: It's not the same
dessert. Stucchi's is an examplar
of that rare native Ann Arbor busi-
ness that has continued to be a city
staple over multiple generations.
It's the place you take your family
to because they haven't heard of
the wonder that is frozen yogurt,
it's where you hang out with
friends you haven't seen since ori-
entation, and most often, Stucchi's

is that wondrous haven where you
can bury your stress and finals-
week panic attacks in a mound of
"Swiss Chocolate Almond."
Yeah, sure, Stucchi's isdifferent
from its competition because it's
local. It has the perfect location
to hop over from home or class for
a quick dessert break, and it's got
enough flavors to keep a sweet-
tooth experimenting for months.
But what makes Stucchi's spe-
cial is it tastes fresher and richer
than any other ice cream in town,
and has flavors so original and
delectable that going to Stucchi's
becomes the rare, special event
you can't help but look forward to.

BEST HOUSING
Zaragon Place

Who lived there? The only per-
son I knew of was a high-school
acquaintance, rumored to have
dropped out of college after he
made his fortune on the stock
market. He drove a Porsche. He
lived the life.
So I had heard.
Do they have hot tubs at Zara-
gon? Rooftop tennis courts?
Live tigers as extravagant pets?
Maybe. I simply didn't know. But
I vowed to myself that if I ever
made it big (hitting the lottery,
creating the next Internet sen-
sation or starting my own band)
I would immediately move to

Zaragon to cement my status as
a kid who was as cool as Ferris
Bueller.
A year or so later, I found
myself rising in Zaragon's eleva-
tor to a party on the top floor. The
dream was coming true, partially.
What sort of wonders would I
encounter? The answer was quite
simple. Instead of exotic animals,
I saw a beautiful apartment. And
while there was no hot tub, there
was an amazing view of a glow-
ing Ann Arbor. Somehow, it was
nothing like I imagined, but it still
met my expectations.

BEST COFFEE SHOP
Espresso Royale

Espresso Royale is the cof-
fee shop you want to walk into
bleary-eyed after a long night of
cramming, frustration and more
than a few nervous breakdowns.
The atmosphere is the perfect
kind of casual: warm and invit-
ing, but as straight-to-business as
the larger coffee chains. Request
just a normal coffee (ever the sin
these days), and you'll receive a
cup, which you can fill with the
perfect ratio of a selection of cof-
fees, milks and whatever accou-
trements are deemed necessary.
And, oh yeah, the coffee is
pretty delicious. Between all of
the self-labeled coffee aficio-
nados and the 12-step ordering
processes, did everyone forget
that most of us just want a cup of

joe to get us through our 9 a.m.
seminar? Well, Espresso didn't.
The pump-pot selection isn't
fancy; it doesn't boast quadru-
ple-roasted coffee. But it does
house some tasty, comforting
blends with simple, unassuming
names: Lighthouse, Solidario,
Carnivale. And the flavors are
anything but - nutty here, floral
there and always ready to give a
morning boost.
That's not to say Espresso can
only brew a simple mugful. Their
vanilla lattds rival any hipster
cafe, and they know their way
around their namesake machine.
Get a sweetheart latt6 (cinna-
mon and vanilla) off the menu for
a delicious day-starter.

BEST SANDWICHES
Zingerman 's

Deciding on Zingerman's
means you're not settling for a
mere sandwich. You're gearing
up for a Zingerman's Reuben -
layered with corned beef, melty
Swiss cheese (from Switzerland!),
sauerkraut and that smooth driz-
zle of Russian dressing, all sweetly
mashed between warm rye bread.
It's the original sandwich of the
gods.
Their heavenly Reuben - and
full menu of other deliciously
scrumptious items - put Ann
Arbor's tiny delicatessen on the
map, making it the must-visit
place for handcrafted sandwich
magic. Even Mario Batali, of Iron
Chef fame, taste-approved Zing-
erman's as the best of the best

where all things corned beef are
concerned. It's no wonder Ann
Arbor-ites voted Zingerman's
the best sandwich. Was there any
other option?
It's really a crime to pit Zinger-
man's against just any other deli.
Since its inception in 1982, it has
far surpassed being considered a
simple "sandwich shop." The icon-
ic Ann Arbor staple makes hand-
crafted art every day it churns out
its beloved, edible product.
As you sink your teeth into the
all-too-appetizing sculpture in
front of you, remember that din-
ing at Zingerman's is an experi-
ence, prices be damned. Don't
forget your free pickle!

It's no great surprise that Biv-
ouac has topped the list again for
best outdoor store. As written in
a recent Yelp review, "If you're an
outdoor enthusiast, you're going
to go ga-ga over this place!" The
locally owned outdoor store has
a huge variety of gear and out-
door-wear brand names. Though
it's hard to gauge the store's pri-
mary market (are they a store for
hardcore outdoor enthusiasts or
the brand-conscious?) Bivouac is
united by one factor: quality.
All of the clothing and gear at
Bivouac is top-notch - exactly
what you need for your moun-
tain-climbing venture over

spring break or your weekend
escapade down to Red Rivet,
Gorge. If you're feeling a little
less adventurous, their ultra-
warm coats will keep you nige
and toasty as you brave the colad
Michigan winter for that house
party across campus. The qugl-
ity does come at a price, but the'
savvy shopper will take advag=
tage of Bivouac's guaranteed
price matching and end-of-sea
son sales.
With its prime location, BiW
ouac is Ann Arbor's hub for botlt
the outdoor enthusiast and the'
fashion-conscious.

BEST MEDITERRANEAN
FOOD
Jerusalem Garden

It doesn't look like much when
you walk in. The cash register and
baklava counter up front don't
scream with the ambiance of an
overpriced Mediterranean chain,
nor do the aproned cooks and siz-
zling grill that take up most of
the restaurant's entryway. But it's
these unrefined quirks that give
Jerusalem Garden its comfort-
able, unpretentious charm - the
paper napkins, potted plants and
wooden furniture tightly hugged
by yellow walls.
The food itself, however, is
what makes J-Garden really stand
out in Ann Arbor's sea of pita-and-
hummus joints. It's here where
you can order a plate of the fresh-
AUSTEN HUFFORD/Daily est falafel around, and tear your

fork through hot, crispy layers
until you hit its soft (and unmis-
takably green) chickpea center.
It's also here that classics such as
the chicken shawarma and Jeru-
salem burger live and thrive in
their pita-wrapped glory - and
don't forget the fabled spinach
pies that aren't always available
to order, but keep Ann Arborites
talking and coming back in enthu-
siastic groups whenever they are.
Jerusalem Garden is, in short,
a bite-sized mecca of simple mas-
terpieces: The hummus is always
creamy, the tabbouli is always tart
and you won't feel out of place in
a ratty jacket or oversized sweat-
shirt.
