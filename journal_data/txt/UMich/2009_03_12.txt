The Economics of Nickels Arcade
Despite drawbacks, new shop
owners say corridor offers
unique business opportunities
By DEVON THOESBY<
For the Daily
Whether as a quick shortcut between State
Street and Maynard Street or as access to more
than a dozen businesses, Nickels Arcade has been
an unquestioned campus landmark since its com-
pletion in 1918.
While the Arcade's intimate atmosphere is
unique, it is less clear how successful of a business
opportunity the shop gallery presents.
Nickels Arcade has been home to dozens of shops
in Ann Arbor throughout its 90-plus years of exis-
tence. But businesses in the gallery have had a high
turnover rate in the past few years, with at least
three new businesses filling vacant spots in the last
year alone.
Still, shop owners say the shopping experience
provided by the arched corridor cannot be found
anywhere else near campus.
While the current state of the economy prob-
ably has affected the boutiques in the Arcade, Jesse
Bernstein, the Ann Arbor Area Chamber of Com-
merce president, maintains that the turnover rate
of shops filling the spaces is not necessarily some-
thing about which to be concerned.
Bernstein said the turnover of businesses in the
Arcade is simply an example of the inconsistency of
business.
"I think it's just economic reality," he said.
"Everybody assumes businesses last forever and
they don't. Things come and go; it's not necessarily - mm
a bad thing." N
However, Bernstein said he still believes it to be
a "great spot" in the city with unquestioned archi- A C-

Wide receiver pled
guilty to charge
in February
ByTREVOR CALERO
Daily News Editor
After Michigan freshman wide
receiver Darryl Stonum showed up
late for his court date today, 15th
District Judge Julie Creal sentenced
him for a charge of operating a vehi-
cle while visibly impaired following
his arrest in late September.
Director of Student Legal Ser-
vices Doug Lewis, who represents
Stonum, would not discuss the spe-

cifics of the judge's sentence, but
Stonum could potentially face up to
93 days in jail, $300 in fines and 360
hours of community services.
A clerk at the 15th District Court
said the information would be avail-
able on the court website either later
today or tomorrow morning.
When he failed to show up for
the court date, Stonum was ini-
tially issued a bench warrant for
his arrest and $1,000 bond. The
warrant was dropped after Stonum
appeared, Lewis said.
When reached by telephone
today, Stonum said that he was at
the sentencing but declined to com-
ment further.
Stonum pleaded guilty to the

charge of operating a vehicle while
visibly impaired in February.
When contacted today, Lewis
disagreed with the premise of
reporting on the case.
"It's no more newsworthy than
the whole alcohol problem of all your
peers," he said of Stonum's offense.
He said that just because Stonum
is a well-known University athlete,
he shouldn't be held to a different
standard.
"It bothers me when you make
an issue out of one person," he said.
"Just because he's a football player
doesn't mean he's different than
anybody else."
Following the incident inSeptem-
ber, Michigan head football coach

Rich Rodriguez suspended Sto-
num from the team's game against
Illinois on Oct. 4 for a "violation of
team rules" but didn't offer any fur-
ther reasoning for the punishment.
On Nov. 4, the day of Stonum's
arraignment, Rodriguez said dur-
ing his weekly Big Ten teleconfer-
ence that Stonum would not be
disciplined further by the team fol-
lowing the one-game suspension.
In the team's next game against
Toledo the next week, Stonum did
play but didn't start. Stonum start-
ed at wide receiver in the rest of the
Wolverines' 12 games last season.
He ended his first season with the
team the season with 14 catches for
176 yards and one touchdown.

Store owners say
economic downturn
won't reduce hiring
from previous years
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Dafly StaffReporter
As unemployment rates across
the country soar, University stu-
dents who plan to spend their
vacation months in Ann Arbor
can rest assured that their sum-
mer job options are intact - for
the most part.
While some local businesses are

downsizing their summer staffs, a
number of owners said they plan
on hiring at rates similar to past
years and, as the economy tumbles,
don't feel the need to cut back.
Sava Lelcaj, who owns and
operates Sava's State Street Cafe,
said hiring rates at her restaurant
have not lowered because of the
economy.
"It'sthe same hiring rate," Lelcaj
said "Wehaven't been really affect-
ed by the recession in Ann Arbor,
and we hire mostly students."

manager of Orchid Lane, a fair-
trade clothing store on East Lib-

THE NEW MEDIA
Warner gives unusually optimistic
forecast for the future of journalism

MIXED BREED

Visiting professor:
New online options
could revamp
troubled industry
By ANNIE THOMAS
For the Daily
In a speech before a standing-
room-only crowd in the Hussey
room of the Michigan League last
night, guest professor Fara Warner
gave an unusually optimistic diag-
nosis for the future of journalism
in an increasingly technologically
oriented culture.
In her talk entitled "The Blogo-
sphere: The Future of Journalism?"
Warner assured attendees that

despite the seemingly dire future
of the industry in the Internet age,
there is much potential for reshap-
ing journalism to tap the full poten-
tial of new technology.
According to Warner, the How-
ard R. Marsh Visiting Professor of
Journalism, 13,000 journalists lost
their jobs last year, in addition to
the number of professional publica-
tions that folded. But she said this is
not reason to believe the industry is
unsalvageable.
"I'vebeenlisteningtopeoplertalk
about my industry and I am tired of
the woe is me, stick our heads in
the sand, and that newspapers are
going to go extinct," Warner said.
"Journalism is not dead. It's vibrant
and it isactive and is being pursued
around the world."
Warner said that today's news

media is mainly an entertainment
source, not satisfying her thirst for
hard-hitting news stories focusing
on the economy, politics and the
war in Iraq.
"To me radio - talk radio in
particular - and cable television
is not about news," Warner said.
"It's about talking heads and par-
tisan politics. It is about argument,
it is about debate, it is about fight-
ing words. It's a cheap way to have
entertainment."
Warner's lecture focused on new
media opportunities for journalism
and, more specifically, Internet sites
that completely revamp the way
people think about journalism.
Warner talked about the innova-
tive ways that people get their news
today, citing examples of twittering

The underground law library

The University's Law School
was founded in 1859, and lust 11
years later, it was the largest law
school in the country.
As the school continued to grow,
the University was forced to make
additions to the school to fulfill
the need for additional space, and
hy the mid-1970s, it was decided
that an addition to the library was
necessary.
MaryClemence, the administra-
tive specialist at the Law Library,
said the University was concerned
at the time that "an above-ground
building would not mesh with
the rest of the Law Quad," and so
the decision was made to build
the addition underground, essen-
tially invisible to the uninformed
observer.
The University enlisted the help
of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates,
of Birmingham, Mich. Birkerts
joined the University faculty in

1959 and, according to the Ameri-
can Institute of Architects, had
earned numerous awards from the
Michigan Society of Architects.
After much planning, construction
on the new addition began in 1978.
Clemence, who was also a part
of the University staff during the
construction of the addition, said
"the vision was so interesting."
"You really did not have a sense of
how it was going to look," she said.
Bulding an underground library
would prove difficult, though, and
the construction was wrought with
setbacks. Layers of sediment and
sand meant that collapses were a
very common event. The fear ofecol-
lapses caused setbacks in construc-
tion, making a lack of funds a very
real threat to the construction of
the addition, according to the Law
School's website.
But in August 1981, the
77,000-square-foot addition finally

opened tn the public. The new addi-
tion was named the Allan and Alene
Smith Law Library, after two prom-
inent donors to the Law School.
Aside from the panes of glasses
sloped down into the ground, the
design of the library addition,
located at the corner of Monroe
Street and Tappan Avenue, is.
almost undetectable.
The large light wells that make
up the "ceiling" of the addition were
designed to provide sunlight to the
library. The addition has the capac-
ity to hold 475,00books according
the Law Schoolswebsite.
Nearly one million volumes are
currently in the library - cover-
ing a broad range of topics includ-
ing foreign, comparative and
international law, as well as court
documents - making it the largest
public university law library in the
country.

WASHINGTON
Obama defends
earmarks, signing
statement position
President Barack Obama, sound-
ing weary of criticism over federal
earmarks, defended Congress' pet
projects yesterday as he signed an
"imperfect" $410 billion measure
with thousands of examples. But
he said the spending does need
tighter restraint and listed guide-
lines to do it.
Obama, accused of hypocrisy by
Republicans for embracing billions
of dollars of earmarks in the legis-
lation, said they can be useful and
noted that he has promised to curb,
not eliminate them.
On another potentially contro-
versial matter, the president also
issued a "signing statement" with
the bill, saying several of its pro-
visions raised constitutional con-
cerns and would be taken merely
as suggestions. He has criticized
President George W. Bush for often
using such statements to claim the
right to ignore portions of new
laws, and on Monday he said his
administration wouldn't fbllow
those issued by Bush unless autho-
rized by the new attorney general.
White House officials have
accused Bush of using the state-
ments to get around Congress in
pursuing anti-terror tactics.
LANSING
150 sex offenders
arrested in sweep
across the state
Michigan State Police say 150
people who were not complying
with conditions of the state's sex
offender registry law have been
arrested.
Police said yesterday they
requested 405 additional arrest
warrants as part of a coordinated
statewide sweep.
The effort involved more than 70
law enforcement agencies working
together in early February.
Police say more than 2,500 sex
offenders have been arrested for
noncompliance in similar opera-
tions since late 2005.
Sex offenders are supposed to
verify their addresses with law
enforcement agencies at least once
a year. Some felony offenders must
report more often.
BEIJING
Record drop in
Chinese exports,
but auto sales up
The record decline in China's
exports accelerated in February,
but Asia's bleak picture was tem-
pered by other news yesterday of
a jump in Chinese auto sales and
a smaller-than-expected drop in
Japanese machinery orders.
Most Asian stock markets
surged after Wall Street staged a
massive rally on news that Citi-
group is turning a profit, a wel-
come respite after weeks of gloom
- although many analysts predict

the market rebound will be short-
lived.
Chinese trade figures highlight-
ed again the region's dependence
on Western consumers. Exports in
February plunged 25.7 percent from
a year earlier, according to customs
data - the sharpest decline report-
ed by the government since it began
keeping records in the 1990s. That
adds pressure on Beijing to move
quickly to carry out a multibillion-
dollar stimulus package aimed at
pumping up the world's third-larg-
est economy.

RESIDENCY
From Page1A
after a somewhat complicated and
lengthy process. However, the
deadline for students filing a resi-
dency classification application
comes after the deadline for pay-
ing tuition.
Criticisms of the residency poli-
cy have arisen amid suggestions by
University officials in early Febru-
ary that they are open to accept-
ing more transfer students who
are facing economic hardship and
can no longer afford out-of-state
tuition. The complexity of the
application process, compounded
by the invitation for more trans-
fer applications, raises questions
about how effectively the Univer-
sity will be able to handle such an
influx.
Joseph, who was classified as
in-state at the University's Dear-
born campus, avoided paying out-
of-state tuition after going through
the complicated process of submit-
ting driver's licenses, passports
and W-2 tax forms to the Residen-
cy Classification Office.
Lester Monts,seniorvice provost
for academic affairs and member
of the Residency Appeal Commit-
tee of the Residency Classification
Office, said that from the summer
of 2007 through the summer of
2008, the Residency Classifica-
tion Office approved 1,833 applica-
tions out of the 2,623 submitted, or
almost 70 percent of applications.
And many of the applicants, just
like Joseph, are Michigan resi-
dents who have transferred to the
University after initially attending
an out-of-state school.
Students like LSA junior Nithya
Ravindran, a Michigan resident
and transfer student from Emory
University, also had.to go through
the process of residency classifica-
tion.
Ravindran said she made the
decision to return home and

increasing in the summer.
"Trends haven'tchanged because
of the economy," Woodside said.
"Right about now in the summer we
are startingto hire again. We always
hire more people in the summer."
Despite the attitudes of some
small business owners around Ann
Arbor, unemployment rates in the
city and county are rising.
Bruce Weaver, economic ana-
lyst for the Michigan Department
of Energy, Labor and Economic
Growth, said unemployment rates
in Washtenaw County are gradu-
ally risinghbut were below the state
of Michigan's unemployment aver-
age in December.
Weaver said the unemployment
'rate was 6.9 percent in December of
last year, which was "much higher
than it was in the early part of'08."
According to Weaver, summer
unemployment rates for 16 to 19 year-
olds are usually around 20 percent.
Some Ann Arbor businesses will
be hiring less between the months
of April and June, compared to
last year at this time, according to
a survey conducted by Manpower
Inc. for The Ann Arbor News.
On Tuesday, the News reported
thesurveyshowed14percentofarea
businesses are planning to "hire at a
slower place" duringthe summer.

attend the University of Michigan,
in part, because of the cost.
"Emory's a private institution
so I was paying like $50,000 a year
without any financial aid, so that
was definitely one of the factors,"
Ravindran said. "My parents said
we're not paying so much for you
to go (to Emory) when you can go
(to the University of Michigan),
and it's just as good."
According to David Potter, chair
of the Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs, the current
process of applying for residency
classification can be an extremely
tedious one for students.
While Potter could not speak on
behalf of SACUA, as it has not yet
reviewed the process of residency
classification for these transfer
students, he said it's one that needs
to be simplified.
"We just want to streamline
that process to cut down the has-
sle for people who are classified
as residents that are going to be
rescinded as soon as people look at
them," Potter said. "It is a pain in
the neck for students to find that
it has been reclassified. We know
that it's goingto be overturned,but
there's still a process."
Potter said the Student Rela-
tions Advisory Committee brought
the residency classification pro-
cess problems to his attention sev-
eral months ago. As a result, Potter
said SACUA will hopefully review
and further discuss the residency
classification process at its April 6
meeting.
Regent S. Martin Taylor
(D-Grosse Pointe Farms) said that
while the process hasn't been fully
reviewed by the Board of Regents,
the system of residency classifica-
tion for these transfer students
needs to be addressed.
"Well I'm certainly going to try
and see if we can simplify it," Tay-
lor said. "Although the issue of res-
idency domicile has always been a
very complex issue, I'm certainly
looking at it."
State Street clothing retailer
Bivouac - a store featuring upscale
outdoor and casual wear - is one
of the businesses anticipating hir-
ing fewer people during the sum-
mer because of the economy.
Ed Davidson, owner of Bivouac,
said that the store has been see-
ing fewer customers and employee
hours have been scaled back as a
consequence.
"It's because of the economy,"
Davidson said. "People are not
shopping as much. We aren't as
busy, so we are cutting back on
the number of people we have in a
given week."
other businesses will not be
hiring during the summer, but for
other reasons.
DavidRoot, general manager at
South University Avenue favorite
The Brown Jug, said the restau-
rant-bar is not looking for new
hires, largely because its current
employees plan to stick around.
"Honestly, the way the econo-
my is isn't really affecting hiring,"
Root said. "The reason we won't
be hiring this summer has noth-
ing to do with the economy, we
just aren't hiring because 85 per-
cent of our staff have been here
for two years, and there is no need
for new positions being filled."
Those staying in Ann Arbor to
find a summer job do not seem
too worried about hiring trends.
Most students, during this time,

Monts said the process of resi-
dency classification for these
transfer students is a necessary
one to make sure students qualify
for in-state tuition.
Monts said the "system in place
is fair and equitable to all students,"
and that residency classification
for these transfer students isn't
something that can be confirmed
simply by viewing the admissions
application because each case is
different.
Although several students who
wenthroughthis processsaidthey
were not aware they would have to
apply for residency classification,
Monts said all University appli-
cants are notified about applying
for residency classification when
they apply for admission.
He said this gives students more
than enough time to file the resi-
dency application form, which can
be processed up to a year prior to
enrollment in order to receive a
timely decision.
"The University takes very seri-
ously its commitment to residents
of the state of Michigan," Monts
said. "And the residency guide-
lines and process have been put
in place to insure that residency
status and all of its benefits are
afforded only to students who are
truly residents."
The review of the residency
classification process has come
during a time when the University
is expecting a slight increase in the
number of transfer students for the
upcoming fall term, Monts said.
In a meeting with SACUA on
March 2, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said the pro-
cess of residency classification is
a complex issue that needs to be
fully understood by the committee
before it seeks to have anything

Despite the turnover problems
in the corridor, some stores - like
Maison-Edwards Tobacconist,
which has been around since 1963
- have managed to succeed in the
Arcade's unique storefronts.
Tom Haywood, director of the
State Street Area Association, said
that with its distinct blend of bou-
tique and one-of-a-kindshops, there
are bound to be some failures.
"It's been historically a place for
unique shops," he said. "Sometimes
they work, sometimes they don't."
Haywood said the current turn-
over rate is simply a result of the
ebb and flow of business paired
with the Arcade's unusual busi-
ness opportunities.
"Businesses (in Nickels Arcade)
will tend to have a higher turnover
rate than other areas because of the
intimacy of the shops," he said. "But
any turnover you're experiencing
nowwouldn'tbemuchhigherthanit
has been in the past 20 years or so."
Haywood also mentioned that
the storefronts in-set location from
the streetworks to their detriment.
Despite the possibility that busi-
ness could be a bit more difficult,
there is no lack of shop owners eager

Warner said, not just for her own
studies but for the future of her

Success with stem cells
Expanding stem cell research at 'U' is necessary for state
n Monday, President Barack Obama overturned a 2001
ban on embryonic stem cell research that former Presi-
dent George W. Bush instituted on 21 stem cell lines. This
means federal money can now go toward research on these lines.
And in light of the passage of last year's Proposal 2 in Michigan, the
University recently announced a new stem cell research program.
These are encouraging developments for scientists who wish to
remain competitive in their field while collaborating in an effort to
cure disease, not just in Michigan but across the country. Michigan
should take advantage of the new policies, bringing much-needed
research and money to the state while saving lives in the process.

Rules don't work if people
have no fear of them."
- Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, referencing
enforcement plans of major companies to prevent fraud, as reported yesterday by The New York Times.
False progress in Darfur

On Election Day, Michigan overturned
a 1978 law that banned the destruction
of embryos. State scientists can now use
embryos that would otherwise have been
discarded from fertility clinics to derive
their own lines. The University also
announced Monday that it's beginning its
stem cell research program thanks to the
easing of restrictions. It has set aside $2
million to hire scientists and lab techni-
cians for the new Consortium for Stem Cell
Research, a part of the A. Alfred Taubman
Medical Research Institute.
Obama's decision shows a distinct policy
difference between his administration and
his predecessor's - a welcome change for
communities like the University that thrive
on research. Embryonic stem cells have
advantages that no other cells have, like the
potential to form any kind of cell, allow-
ing them to be manipulated easily and for
cures to be developed. Stem cell research
is a crucial research that will save lives -
scientists generally believe that embryonic
stem cell research can lead to cures for dis-
eases like juvenile diabetes and Parkinson's
disease. Now that restrictions on research
have been lifted, scientists at the University
and in the state can be competitive with sci-

entists around the country and worldwide,
developing cures to diseases that effect mil-
lions of lives.
This competition will help bring
researchers and money to Michigan as well
as allow for more scientists to collaborate
on research. The University has a stem cell
research lab at the University of California
at San Diego, and now scientists can do the
same research here, doubling the efforts
and pooling resources across the country.
This will also bring in more private dona-
tions as well as even more federal funding.
Increasing stem cell research here is good
for the state because it helps establish the
University as a premier research institu-
tion, in turn boosting the state's economy.
Despite the controversy surrounding
the destruction of embryos, this develop-
ment will benefit the economy while work-
ing toward solutions for sick and suffering
people. Obama's decision shows that his
administration is separating ideology from
the practicality of research, something the
Bush administration failed to do. The ben-
efits of embryonic stem cell research are
undeniable, and scientists from around the
country will now be able to make something
of its potential.

Last week, the International
Criminal Court issued an
arrest warrant for Sudan's
president, Omar al-
Bashir, on charg-
es of war crimes
in Darfur. Many
were pleased by
the news, within
Sudan's borders
and abroad, but a
remarkably large
number of orga- IBRAHIM
nizations were
angered by the KAKWAN_
decision. The most
notable of these
was the African Union, which has
peacekeepers deployed in Darfur and
which to date has been the organiza-
tion most involved in protecting sta-
bility in the region.
This action, while sure to be cel-
ebrated by shortsighted activists,
will backfire on the very individu-
als it is intended to protect. Weary
of additional foreign interference in
its affairs, the Sudanese government
scaled back the activities of several
non-governmental organizations
which it fears may have ties to for-
eign governments. It may seem like
paranoia, but in a place where the
Central Intelligence Agency has been.
confirmed to be active as recently as
1996 - funneling millions of dollars
to anti-government rebel groups -
such fears are not unfounded.
In addition to the harm the war-
rant's aftermath will cause the Dar-
fur civilians caught in the civil war, it
will also strain ties between the Unit-
ed States and its allies in the African
Union and Arab League.
At a time when the U.S. is losing
ground in Africa to China, which in
recent years has increased ties to a
number of African nations, support-
ing this decision is not in the U.S.'s
interest. Unlike the nations of South
America, Asia and Europe, the major-

ity of African countries secured their
independence within the last 60
years. As such, they remain weary of
foreign interference. Supporting the
issuance of an arrest warrant for the
active president of an African nation
will be taken as an assault on national
sovereignty and a throwback to a
colonialist era that has not yet faded
from minds of many Africans.
What's more, a coalition of nations
represented by the A.U., the Arab.
League, the Non-Aligned Movement,
China and Russia have all called for
a suspension of the arrest warrant.
Together, these countries represent a
majority of the nations in the United
Nations.
Unfortunately, the Security Coun-
cil is expected to veto any resolutions
calling for the warrant's suspension.
It seems that the Western govern-
ments, which have sat idle since the
beginning of the conflict, will now
intervene and impose their will
against the wishes of the majority of
the developing world and a large per-
centage of the Sudanese people.
But in the more immediate sense,
the warrant will be little more than
symbolic. Bashir has to leave Sudan
to be arrested, and he has to go to a
country that is willing to arrest him.
Given the dismal support for the war-
rant, such countries are few and far
between. And it's not like the Suda-
nese people are trying to get rid of
him, either - he enjoys widespread
support across much of the country,
and on a recent visit to northern Dar-
fur, he was enthusiastically greeted
by thousands of supporters.
What is particularly worrisome is
that Sudan is not a member of the ICC.
If the ICC can charge the acting pres-
identof a non-signatory country, then
it sets a precedent that would allow
the issuance of warrants against offi-
cials of other countries that are not a
part of the Rome Statute, and there-.
fore not under the jurisdiction of the
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

ICC. Such countries not under the
ICC's jurisdiction include the United
States and Israel.
Perhaps part of the problem is that
the ICC chose to only charge Bashir.
The leaders of one of the country's
largest rebel groups, the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army - which
also stands accused of human rights
abuses by Amnesty International -
have escaped litigation. In fact its
leader, Salva Mayardit, spent this
week in Japan on the invitation of the

Japanese government.
It is understandable that the A.U.,
the Arab League and a host of other
nations would stand against the
ICC's actions. The fact that Sudan's
president was charged for pursuing a
civil war against armed rebels when
those responsible for illegal war in
Iraq have met no personal legal chal-
lenges, could easily be seen as bias in
much of the non-Western world.
What little influence the U.S. has in
Sudan is already starting to decrease.
On Tuesday, the U.S. State Depart-
ment issued a statement calling for
all nonessential personnel to leave
the country, citing increased security
concerns. If we act against the will
of the A.U., the ability of the U.S. and
other Western governments to exert
influence on other African nations
will be diminished in the future,
whether this influence would be used
to promote peace or economic ties.

Islamic teaching, history
doesn't condone violence
TO THE DAILY:
Yesterday, the Daily ran an article about ter-
ror suspects on trial that made my heart sad
(9/11 suspects on trial defend terror attacks,
3/11/09). The story described the suspects as
"terrorists to the bone" who used a "violent
interpretation of Islam."
Islam is a religion of peace and never -con-
dones violence against innocent people. The
Quran says, "God does not love the aggressors"
(2:190). The concept of a violent interpretation
of Islam is contradictory. You might as well
say a vegetarian is a meat lover or a Christian
is an atheist. These individuals used the reli-
gion of Islam as a means to rally people to their
political cause. There is nothing in the prophet
Muhammad's behavior that set an example for

what these terrorists have committed.
I was always taught the stories of when the
prophet Solomon and his army came across an
anthill and the great pains they took not tosstep
on it. If a Muslim is to show such great com-
passion for an ant, then imagine how we should
treat people. Possibly the most important les-
son I ever learned from the prophet came dur-
ing his return to Mecca, his birthplace. He
returned triumphantly with many companions
and believers to the city where he and his fam-
ily were tortured, starved and exiled. He could
have taken revenge upon all the people who
hurt him in the past, but instead, he prayed for
them - the same way the Prophet Jesus prayed
for the people attempting to kill him.
Muslims around the world will never forget
those lessons of peace and respect for man. For-
tunately, I will soon forget yesterday's story.

to all students. Of GREEN
course, we pay for
our medical cov-
erage as part of
tuition, but the price has been widely
accepted because those who set and
pay tuition have deemed excellent
health coverage worthwhile.
Sadly, the U.S. does not work as
efficiently as the University - but it
may soon be moving in that direc-
tion. In his address to Congress last
month, President Barack Obama
interwove plans for universal health
care with his basic formula for fix-
ing the economy. Those who weren't
Twittering in the audience heard
an evocative and optimistic plan for
curing America's sick health care
system. But there are the ideologues
- opposed. to what they ignorantly
refer to as "socialism" - standing in
the way of universal health coverage
for all Americans.
Many of these people believe that
health care is a privilege rather than
an inherent human right. They say
that a health care system like the
current American model promotes
a hearty incentive to succeed in
order to provide adequate medical
care. But applying this survival-of-
the-fittest rationale to the health of
human beings implies that if some-
one doesn't have the means, they are
apparently not entitled to be healthy.

Charles Darwin would be so proud.
But in a society noted for its unique-
ness, modernity and self-proclaimed
civilized nature, survival of the fit-
test is an antiquated perspective.
Other blind rightists carry on
about American medicine being on
the cutting edge of the industry, and
worry that if we socialize health care,
its quality might diminish. It's unde-
niable that American hospitals, doc-
tors and medical schools are some of
the most innovative in the world. But
for a profession entirely dedicated to
helping people, the current health
care system doesn't appear to be pay-
ing it forward.
According to the 2008 Central
Intelligence Agency Factbook, the
average life expectancy in the U.S. is
78 years. It is 82 years in Japan, 80.8
in France and 80.6 in Sweden. All told,
29 of the states in the United Nations
outrank the United States on terms of
life expectancy. If our current system
is actually the most fabulous, then
how could it be that Americans live
shorter lives than citizens of Israel
and the Netherlands? The fact that
the U.S. is one of the only industri-
alized nations on Earth that doesn't
provide universal health care prob-
ably has something to do with it.
A column by the New York Times'
Nicholas Kristof (<em>Franklin Del-
ano Obama</em>, 2/28/2009) points
out that the current model of getting
insurance from one's employer did
not arise from any sort of brilliant
plan for widespread insurance cov-
erage. Instead, businesses started
providing insurance as a fringe ben-
efit when workers were scarce during
World War II. Today, with millions
of people out of work, America can.
no longer rely on its employers to
provide insurance. The current eco-
nomic crisis only exemplifies why it's
time for national health care policies
to change.

It's odd that right-wing, free-mar-
ket capitalists have not realized that
by placing the burden of insurance
costs on the government, costs are
then lifted from businesses who no
longer have to worry about providing
insurance. "Among General Motors'
burdens," Kristof wrote, "is that it
has to pay health costs e4uivalent to
$1,500 for each car it sells." He then
suggests that many foreign business-
es do not have to worry about pro-
viding such a costly benefit and are
therefore have a competitive advan-
tage over American companies.
Our country's
medical coverage
needs a checkup.
It is certainly expensive to pro-
vide health coverage for all Ameri-
cans. Tax increases will be imposed
upon the lucky few that can afford
them. But look at the big picture - a
startling number of Americans have
to choose between their health and
their home and between buying pills
and buying food. Affluent Americans
should want to help pay for the secu-
rity of those facing such decisions.
Republicans complain a. lot about
government spending. But they didn't
seem to mind paying for a war in Iraq
- merely a slice of the larger war on
terror - at a price of about $600 bil-
lion and counting, according to the
National Priorities Project. Paying
to make the world healthier makes
much more sense than paying to com-
plicate it.

'Humble' Wohlberg
excels on Blue's top line

M' preps for Big Tens

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
It's hard to imagine freshman
forward David Wohlberg - the
Michigan hockey team's second-
leading goal scorer - being moved
off the Wolverines' top line.
But last year, while playing for
the U.S. National Development
Team, he wasn't just demoted to
a lower line for a few weeks in the
season's second half - he was sent
down to the under-17 team from
the under-18 squad.
"It's like going from the varsity
to the JV," associate head coach
Mel Pearson said. "So it was a
wake-up call, but I thought he
handled it extremely well."
On Monday, Wohlberg was
named to the CCHA's All-Rookie
Team by the conference's coach-
es. The South Lyon native has .85
points per game, a CCHA best
among freshmen.
"I think it all started with last
year," Pearson said. "It's a demo-
tion, so I think at that point it all
started there.
"I think he used that as motiva-
tion coming into this year, and he
was prepared right from the get-

Famed Green Bay Packers coach
Vince Lombardi once said, "If it
doesn't matter who wins or loses,
then why do they keep score?"
Lombardi was a classic coach with
a classic mindset - the only thing
that matters about sports is win-
ning.
Some Michigan men's basket-
ball fans may be alarmed to find
out that's not the theory Wolverine
coach John Beilein holds for every
game.

Beilein, who daily.com
employed the
same strategy during his inaugural
22-loss season in Ann Arbor, must
be doing something right. Dur-
ing his stint at West Virginia, he'
took teams lacking top-level talent
to the Elite Eight and Sweet Six-
teen. And there's no denying that
he's already turning the Michigan
program around in his sophomore
campaign.
But his "get better first" strat-
egy came under heavy criticism
when the Wolverines dropped an
overtime game at Iowa on Feb. 22 -
during which first-team All-Big Ten
selection Manny Harris sat out the
extra period. Beilein felt he needed
to send his star player a message.
"I didn'tthink (Harris) was really
playing well," Beilein said after the
loss to the Ann Arbor News. "He
didn't look fresh, he wasn't himself,
and so we decided to go in another
direction."

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Michigan coachJohn Beilein benched Manny Harris in overtime against owa on Feb. 22.

At the time, it looked like the loss
would officially knock the Wolver-
ines out of the running for an NCAA
Tournament bid. But Io and behold,
Harris has looked like a whole new
player and Michigan has looked
like a whole new team since that
loss, upsetting Purdue and stealing
a road game from Minnesota to get
right back in the tournament hunt.
Losing the Iowa game wasn't the
end of the world. Sitting Harris for
overtime and sending the all-star
sophomore a poignant message was
about the bigger picture.
"If we lose a game, we lose a
game, but did we get better?" Mer-
ritt said. "How did we learn from
that game? That's always been (Bei-
lein's) focus and that's what I love
about him."
Now, after a 31 regular-season
games to focus on getting better,
the Wolverines (19-12) will get a
shot at revenge against that same
Iowa team today in the first round
of the Big Ten Tournament.
Beilein, with four full days to pre-
pare for the Hawkeyes, is focusing
his attention on Iowa coach Todd
Lickliter's defensive style, which he
brought with him from Butler and
features a game-changing big man
in the middle with senior Cyrus

Tate.
The Hawkeyes held Michigan to
just 9-of-37 shooting after the break
in the Wolverines' loss in February.
"You hear about the Purdue
defense, Michigan State and the
Ohio State zone, but this Iowa team
is very good," Beilein said. "It is like
(Lickliter's) Butler defenses.- you
think they aren't guarding you, but
they are guarding you like crazy."
Although most men's basket-
ball pundits have Michigan in
their latest NCAA Tournament
mock brackets, the Wolverines will
breath much easier with a win this
afternoon.
And Beileinknows you can't take
anything for granted this time of
year.
"You have to go in to these games
with that same idea," Beilein said.
"You cannotcount on anything.You
have to go in there and say 'Listen,
all these games are very important,'
but at the same time you don't want
to be in there fearful. Go in there
and play to win.
"You are the only one that can
control you destiny right now.
There are so many other things
that are going on that are out of you
control. A win over Iowa would be
great for us."

Wolverines riding high on
21-match home win streak

Michigan hasn't lost
at Varsity Tennis
Center since 2006
By GILAD BERKOWITZ
Daily Sports Writer
The last time the Wolverines
lost at home, most of the Michi-
gan women's tennis team's mem-
bers were still in high school.
ThelasttimeMichigan dropped
a match at the Varsity Tennis Cen-
ter was on March 4, 2006 against
Texas A&M. The team has been
unstoppable in Ann Arbor and is
currently riding a 21-game win-
ning streak at home.
"We always have a shot to win
at home," Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein said. "The crowd helps
pull us through in those close 4-3
matches."
Opponents haven't fared well
since the building opened in 1997.
Michigan has an 89-37 (.718)
record all-time at the complex.
"We are so familiar with the
building, we practice there every
day," Bernstein said. "It's dif-
ferent than when we travel to a
Miami and have to adjust to the
weather."
Since the eight indoor courts
in the Varsity Tennis Center were
awarded the "Court of the Year
Award" by Tennis Industry mag-
azine in 2000, the complex has
undergone renovations.
State-of-the-art electronic
scoreboards, both on the indoor
and outdoor courts, individual

video cameras on every indoor
court and a brand-new, stylish
audio system have been added.
"Our facility is one of the best
in the country." Bernstein said.
"The Athletic Department does
an incredible job with its upkeep-
ing."'
Bernstein, who is in her second
season with the Wolverines, said
that the high quality of the facili-
ties contributed to her decision to
coach at Michigan.
The spacious facility even helps
during games.
"We have so much space
between courts and behind them
that we have very few lets," Bern-
stein said of the court, which has
20 feet between courts and 24
feet between the baseline and the
back curtains.

"It's very unusual for an indoor
facility to have that much room in
between courts."
Sophomore Rika Tatsuno said
a mental boost is the most benefi-
cial part of the Wolverines' home-
field advantage.
But there's nothing that she can
reference to explain the comfort-
able atmosphere the team feels at
home other than support of the
crowd.
Although the Varsity Tennis
Center is almost a mile and a half
away from the Union, Bernstein
hopes the state-of-the-art facil-
ity will help begin to draw fans to
matches.
"We want to get out to the
community, and we just got to
keep being successful to do that,"
Bernstein said.

For Friday, March1 3, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
In a celestial fluke, fair Venus is now
staying in your sign for four months
instead of four weeks. (Hello?) This
beautifully paves the way for you to be
charming and diplomatic with everyone.
Ole!
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Despite the fact that you're popular
and unusually active with groups, clubs,
organizations and friends, you still need
some solitude. Give yourself some time
to ruminate.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Artistic friends are in your life more
than usualnow. Friendscould become
lovers.
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
People are impressed with you lately,
especially bosses, parents and VIPs. You
look so good, some of you are starting a
ronance with your boss!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Travel for pleasure is in the stars for
you now or in the next few months.
Business related to publishing, the
media, medicine and the law will be
profitable.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
The next few monthssare an excellent
time to negotiate wills, inheritances or
any disputes about shared property.
There's a good chance things will settle
in your ftavor.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Relations with partners and close
friends are excellent now because fair
Venus is promoting this. In fact, some
relationships are getting extremely cozy!
(Be still, my beating heart.)

SCOR PIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Co-workers have been unusually sup-
portive lately. Fortunately, this support
and mutual friendship will continue for
the next few months. Now is the time to
ask for cooperation.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Romance, love affairs, vacations and
anything having to do with sports or the
arts will flourish beautifully now and in
the next few months. It willbe easier to
make a profit from these areas as well.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Continue with decorating or renovat-
ing plans to improve your home. The
next few months are the perfect time to
entertain where you live. (It's a great
time for real estate deals as well.)
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
The next few months are excellent for
negotiations, signing contracts, and
repairing misunderstandings with sib-
lings and relatives. Retail businesses can
itmpraveras welt.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
You're spending money on beautiful
things for yourself and loved ones.
Fortunately, you also have opportunities
to increase your earnings. Look for any
chance to boost your cash flow.
YOU BORN TODAY You believe in
fate. Because of this, you overcome all
obstacles. You believe in your own evo-
lutionary growth; therefore, you strive to
become a better person. You are unusu-
ally convincing and persuasive when
you choose to be. You're courageous and
willing to accept what happens.
Something you've been involved with
for about nine years will diminish or end
this year.

weekend
essentials
Mar. 12 to Mar. 15
ON STAGE
"Kiss of the Spider
Woman" is a complex,
gritty musical that
depicts two cellmates
in a Latin American
prison and their strug-
gle to understand the
nature of heroism. This
weekend, MUSKET -
the University's only
student-run musical
theatre troupe - will
bring the dark, conflict-
ridden show to the
Power Center stage on
Friday and Saturday
at 8 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 p.m. Tickets are
$7 from the Michigan
League Ticket office.
CONCERT
This Saturday, Wolf
Parade frontman Dan
Boeckner takes his
husband-and-wife
side project, Hand-
some Furs, for a spin
at the Blind Pig. With
slick, fuzzy indie-rock
riffs propelled by clap-
heavy drum machines
(and a just-released
album, Face Control),
the performance is
surefire hipster bait.
Silverghost and Child-
light open; tickets are
$10 and doors are
at 9:30 p.m.18+.
FILM
Missing winter already,
you crazy masochist?
Then check out "Let
the Right One In," the
new-to-DVD vampire
import from Sweden.
It never stops snow-
ing in this tale of a
mentally disturbed
prepubescent boy who
suspects his new best
friend/girlfriend may
actually be a murder-
ing bloodsucker. As
the suspense mounts

and the lines between
child, adult and vam-
pire are continually
blurred, the movie will
certainly leave you
feeling very cold.
LIBRARY
Stephanie Izard,
University alum and
winner of "Top Chef"
season four, will be
coming to the Ann
Arbor Downtown
Library (343 S. Fifth
Avenue) on Sunday
from 2 to 3:30 p.m. As
the series's first female
winner, Izard will give a
talk on her experiences
on "Top Chef" and her
work in the Chicago
food scene. She will
also give a demonstra-
tion of her culinary
prowess. Free to all.

ONLINE GAMES OF THE WEEK

KNUCKLEHEADS
Two noticeably angry metal heads, one
purple and one green, swing each other
around on a chain through a dark, demon-
ic world. Color-coded platforms, villains
and giant fireballs force you to put your
heads together properly to pass obstacles
and eventually reach the end of the level.
The controls can get weird when you're
hanging upside down, but the game is still
well worth it.

PLANET RUNNER
In an homage to the best of the worst
old arcade games, this is a simple jaunt
through a green grid plagued by spiked
poles, bouncing circles and large chasms
of death. As the planet runner, you will
jump, dodge, shoot and maneuver your
way through the obstacles, collecting
power-ups along the way to help you
fend off the evil minions and fight the
boss at each world's end.

Forest Juziuk
Manager, Wazoo Records
What are the five bands that
will break out in 2009?
Thank You: Difficult to describe, Thank You's songs are a kind of controlled
chaos of Farfisa organ, guitar and drums - trulyunlike anything else.
Mi Ami: A dance band that's more dub than disco, Mi Ami toured and self-
released several limited edition 12" EPs way before putting out a full-length on
Touch & Go/Quarterstick.
Abe Vigoda: Born of the same all-ages L.A. scene as 2008 breakout No Age, Abe
Vigoda's shoegazey punk is subtle but tasty.
Emeralds: This Midwest three-piece transcended from a lo-fi noise band into
purveyors of beautiful and strangely accessible synthed-out drone.
Tyvek: It doesn't matter how many times they practice or how many shows
they play, Tyvek will always be beautifully loose basement damage.

TRAILER REVIEW
PUBLIC ENEMIES
UNIVERSAL
Recessions always bring out thebest in gangsters. Michael Mann's Depression-era "Public
Enemies" looks to evoke a "Bonny and Clyde"-like vibe. It asks the audience to root for the
bad guy (Johnny Depp as John Dillinger) robbing all the stuck-upbanks and ogle his hotgirl-
friend (Oscar-winning Marion Coutillard). Then again, with Christian Bale - the Batman
himself - hot on Depp's trail, maybe pickinga side won't be as easy as it seems. Here's hoping
Mann can dig a little deeper than summer movie tommy-gun-firing mania.

g'RISTAR' (1995
A clas.
By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
Like stars, video game consoles have pre-
dictable lifespans. And they usually burn
out slowly, hanging on to life years after
they've been outshone by their peers. Sega
Genesis faded faster than most. Its legacy
is embodied in Sonic the Hedgehog, a video
gamze hero who saved his furry friends from
the grips of cyborg slavery. Though the sys-
tem and its mascot enjoyed rock-star levels
of success from 1990 to 1993, rival platform
Super Nintendo boasted better hardware
and amassed a superior game library. Even
in the face of certain defeat in the "console
wars," Sega continued to produce more
games. "Ristar" - the system's last hurrah
- arrived in 1995.
While "Ristar" wasn't the last game
released for the Genesis, it was the last great
one. Its title is ironic in a way, suggesting that
the console's "rising star" (the main charac-

) SEGA GENESIS
sic from the last days of Genesis

ter is also star-shaped) was rapidly falling.
Such great games are testament to the condi-
tions of a system's twilight days. At the time,
there were technical limitations and the sys-
tem's profit potential had been exhausted. In
this dire situation, some developers might
have reckoned that they had nothing to lose,
and went on to create the masterpiece they
had always dreamed about.
If anything about "Ristar" is forgettable,
it's the vanilla storyline. The evil space pirate
Greedy (seriously) has enslaved all the lead-
ers of the planets in Ristar's solar system, and
it's up to the titular hero to save the day.
Our hero's superpower is simply a pair
of stretchy arms, but they're surprisingly
versatile. He can grab items, climb walls,
head-butt baddies and swing his body to and
fro. Much of the game's pleasure is found in
acrobatics, and the levels are chock full of
objects to ride, climb, swing and vault on. So
if Sonic's adventures provide pinball thrills,
then "Ristar" captures the childlike joy of

playground romps.
Superficially, the game's levels are just
riffs on tired video game aesthetics: spooky
forests, water-logged temples, frozen moun-
tains and volcanic wastelands. Planet Under-
Colorful graphics
and fun gameplay
make 'Ristar' a gem.
tow's flooded dungeons are filled with
devious traps and mini-boss battles. Frigid
planet Freon features slippery jumping seg-
ments and a snowball fight. Yet Planet Sonata
is the most intriguing, with rhythm-based
obstacles and puzzles based around deliver-
ing metronomes to songbirds. Each world's
bosses are equally
impressive, with their
complex attack patterns
and whimsical designs.
Planet Scorch's guard-
ian is a mechanical mole
that fires his claws, bur-
rows underground and
even engages Ristar
while the two plummet
down a rocky abyss. And

that's just one of eight planets.
While the game's ideas are fresh enough
on their own, the graphics and music bring
the title to life. Genesis was often criticized
for its limited range of colors, but the psy-
chedelic palette of "Ristar" is still stunning
today. From soft lavenders to neon greens
and earthen oranges, the game's environ-
ments pulse with life. Enemy designs are dis-
tinctive, drawing inspiration from real-life
armored animals like lobsters, hermit crabs
and armadillos. The soundtrack is even more
creative, blending funk, electronica and hip
hop. Song "Crying World" joins eerie pitch-
bending wails to watery synth chords and
bare break-beats. Fittingly, Ristar can swim
through the air in the level. Throughout the
game, musical and visual themes are woven
together.
The story of Sega Genesis is written into
"Ristar" through its ornate pixel art. Ristar
himself was based on the same prototype
character as Sonic the Hedgehog, and thus
could be thought of as a distorted image of
the Genesis's mascot - a new symbol for
changing times in the industry. Sonic sym-
bolized an environmental activist, echoing
progressive ideas of the time. Ristar repre-
sented something more localized: Sega's own
anxiety about its impending doom. Bursting
with creativity, color and ambition, "Ristar"
is a glibly optimistic work of game art. Gen-
esis didn't fade out with a whimper; it went
out with a bang.

Cougars, couples
and concubines

or those of you in search
of a high-quality blow job,
I have good news: Charles
Barkley is out of jail after a three-
day sentence
for his Decem-
ber DUI. So
just follow.
Barkley, who
will likely be
wearing the
blue-and-red
jumpsuit he MARK
served his sen- SCHULTZ
tence in, to his
fellatio-apt concubine and you'll
be set. He'll surely be visiting her
for at least six to eight minutes for
the next couple days.
Sadly, Barkley's love life is rela-
tively normal compared to Chris
Brown and Rihanna's. Though my
tolerance for volatile celebrity rela-
tionships is very high - hence my
writing this column - even I'm sick
of hearing about the romantic woes
of these two. But writing about
gossip without mentioningthem
would be like talking about "Twin
Peaks" without discussing cherry-
pie-loving Special Agent Cooper.
So here it goes: First, the two get
back together. Then, to the chagrin
of Daddy Brown and already-over-
worked members of Social Services,
the two get married and begin
recording a duet. Outspoken celeb-
rities - not sure why I even both-
ered adding "outspoken" - across
the country are weighing in on the
couple. Oprah recently said - from
her structurally fortified soapbox -
"Getyourself some counseling, take
care of yourself."
Jesse McCartney, apparently
ina hallucinatory state where he
thinks it's 2004 and people still
care about him, had this to say:
"From what I've seen and from
what I know of (Brown), he's
always been a gentleman." Yes, and
I've heard that Mussolini charac-
ter wasn't such a bad guy either.
I'm not sure how long the two will
stay together anyway once Ri-Ri
learns the woman who sent Brown
those lascivious text messages was
none other than Brown's manager
Tina Davis. Which means there's
a solid chance Davis will be filing
Brown's W-4 while wearing a body
cast and one of those metal halos. I
mean, one of those two is going to
beat her up eventually; it's a matter
of simple mathematics.
All this talk about guys beating
up their girlfriends is a little sicken-
ing. So let me switch records and
talk about girls abusing their boy-
friends. Kelly Bensimon, cougarish
"star" of "The Real Housewives
of New York City" (a show I can
only assume actually exists), was
arrested last week for beatingup
her younger boyfriend. Yikes. Kelly,
if you want to avoid being labeled
a "cougar," maybe you should stop
actually mauling people.
Moving from the realm of
aggressive to passive-aggressive,
"Heroes" star Hayden Panettiere
is apparently flummoxed she
still has to work with co-star and
ex-boyfriend Milo "How do you
pronounce that?" Ventimiglia.
So she's quietly trying to get him

bred, complaining to producers
and refusing to be on the set when
Milo's around. Until that happens,
the dwarfish actor, who plays a
confident, invincible cheerleader,
is demonstrating how very dissim-
ilar she is to her character. "Don't
you ever touch me!" and "You all
make my life miserable!" were
just two of the exclamations she
howled at paparazzi during, nicely
enough, a hospital fundraiser.
On the subject of more, you
know, "seasoned" women, I'd like
to discuss a couple improper ways
to look younger, featuring Madon-
na. The first way: Just in time for
the Vanity Fair Oscars party, firm
up your skin with a temporary
facelift involving hooks and tubes
in your epidermis. Though it
seemed to have worked for her, I
can't get used to the fact that the
Material Girl is now filled with
actual material.
The second way: When the hooks
start to slowly peel your skin off
like flesh-eating bacteria, take them
out and feminize the old saying
"Clothes make the man." Dress like
a little schoolgirl, and everyone will
assume you're young, right? Well,
no, and honestly, Madonna's new
look reminded me of when I put the
neighbor girl's Schoolgirl Barbie in
the microwave. To be fair, Madon-
Charles Barkley:
a man of taste.
na was on her way to a Kabbalah
Purim party. Purim, a wonderful
Jewish holiday whose existence is
known to about 2 percent of non-
Jews, was celebrated this Tuesday
and Wednesday. I thought I'd cel-
ebrate a little myself by listing my
favorite celebrity costumes from
this week. As a sort of nod to the
fashion times, these costumes were
not worn to actual costume parties.
Britney Spears and Jessica
Simpson: both in Daisy Duke
cutoffs, both in that awkward
area between their best and worst
physiques where you don't leer
but you don't turn away. I'll give
the pity prize to Jessica Simpson,
because her insistence on wearing
cutoffs to almost all her sparsely-
attended concerts means she
considers starring in "Dukes of
Hazard" a career zenith she'd like
to relive. Which is just sad.
The Pussycat Dolls: Capitalizing
on the success of "Slumdog Million-
aire," the "singing" group appeared
on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"
in traditional Indian dress, includ-
ingscarves and bindis. Fortunately,
they did not break into a rendition
of that "Jai Ho" song.
These are all great, but I'd -
have to give the grand prize to
the Ryan Adams impersonator
who recently married Mandy
Moore. Oh wait - that's actually
Adams? Awkward ...
Schultz is looking for Barkely's
phone number. If you have it, e-mail
it to him at markthosOumich edu.

The Silk Road Ensemble features over 60m usicians hailing from countries across the globe.
On the Road of gold

Ma's ensemble brings its
unique cultural insight to
Hill this weekend
By BEN VANWAGONER
and ABIGAIL COLODNER
Daily Arts Writers
The name of The Silk Road Ensemble comes
from the collection of trade

routes that, for 2,000 years,
branched across Europe, Asia
and Africa. This physical
connection had implications
far beyond the exchange of
desired goods - it sparked
ideas. Goods were the
exchange, but culture was the
contact high. Both deliber-
ately and inadvertently, new
ideas lead to innovation and
acculturation. The Silk Road
Project is Yo-Yo Ma's effort to
recreate those trends of cul-

tural collaboration at relative warp-speed.
These days, actual travel or trade seem
almost unnecessary for gathering culture. The
privileged, successful people who can sell out
a concert hall hardly need to go anywhere to
juice up their craft when endless information is
available in books or from the Internet. Or so
it would seem. The Silk Road Project's artistic
director, the unstoppably buoyant cellist and
educator Yo-Yo Ma, thinks differently.
The cultural exchanges that historically
took weeks - if not years - to occur are made,
familiarized and expanded vigorously by Ma
and his collaborators. The Silk Road Ensem-
ble creates new music in real time and space,
gathering far-flung artists together on one
stage. The collaborative power of this diverse,
mobile and committed group seems exponen-
tial, and the face-to-face live performance
focus of Ma's Ensemble gives that power room
to grow.
The Ensemble - the musical center of the
Project - is comprised of almost 60 members
who originate from countries like Azerbaijan,
Korea and Argentina. It was founded by Ma
in 1998 as a philanthropic effort and began
as a musical body in 2000 at Tanglewood,

an ambitious outdoor music festival held in
Lenox, Mass. The Ensemble will perform this
weekend with around 15 members in two sep-
arate programs at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday
at Hill Auditorium.
Focused originally on music from central
and east Asia - along the original Silk Road -
the group's work has since expanded to include
music from nearly every part of the world,
propelled in part by its diverse membership.
Although commissioning pieces is still a cen-
tral part of the project's outreach, much of their
music is now composed by the Ensemble's own
musicians, with their enormous different world
of sound in mind.
University alum Mark Suter, who compos-
es for the Ensemble, described the process:
"Sometimes someone will bring in something
and we all add what we think will be pertinent
and interesting."
Sometimes, he added, "it's based purely on
improvisation. Other times, they have an idea
that's more fleshed out, and we work from that.
It really varies based on who brings the idea."
Suter spoke warmly of composing with the
group and its potential for encouraging even
more exchange.
"You have to trust each other," Suter said.
"The real beauty of this group is that we're
always curious and trying to learn from work-
ing from within."
Suter, who plays percussion In the group,
spoke of the Ensemble as a metaphor, draw-
ing out a historical phenomenon's implica-
tions. The collaboration ends up "connecting
neighborhoods," he said, echoing the statement
on The Silk Road Project website's main page:
"Our vision is to connect the world's neighbor-
hoods by bringing together artists and audi-
ences around the globe."
"Neighborhoods" may seem like merely a
cute word choice, but its overtones are on point;
in Ma's setup, the boundaries between distinct
ways of being can be crossed as easily as a single
street or a theater stage.
Much of the project's success hinges on its
ability to make small adjustments to age-old
traditions, enabling them to share common
ground. If there is one consistent cultural note
in the ensemble, it's the Western tradition of
staged concert hall performance. The stan-
dard provides structure: a unifying, equalizing
premise for the open-ended musical experi-

mentation. In it, Ma continuously brings the
performers back to a central hub of their col-
laboration.
Ma is a hub himself - a grounding presence.
Joseph Lam, a University professor of Musicol-
ogy who is familiar with the ensemble's work
and Ma's influence, says that Ma asks the art-
ists "to learn from each other, with (Ma) as a
guiding principle."
Ma's appeal to the public is evidently no
simple matter of force of personality - com-
bined, of course, with his remarkable skill as a
musician. He's not just a spectacle or a star. His
name instead has a near panacea effect. As a
benefactor and innovator of the arts (and their
creation, mobility and education), Ma is an icon
of well-executed ideas. He puts forth the vision
of arts as wholism into action.
"He creates a platform so everyone can com-
municate," Lam said.
This may sounda little too easy. Does getting
together enough people from enough corners of
the globe and crowding together enough dispa-
rate instruments result in something "innova-
tive" by nature of smorgasbord alone? Lam says
no.
"If you look deeper, it's not totally rosy," said
Lam.
Certain musical traditions lose too much of
themselves in combination, he said. Lam uses
Kunqu, the Chinese opera, as an example:
"Some ritual music would not work well with
Yo-Yo Ma's. Nothing can be everything to
everyone."
This isn't a failure on Ma's part, Lam sug-
gested, but an asset of the Project.
"It behooves a more critical audience," said
Lam. "If they are fascinated about (the breadth
of tradition) they'll ask, 'What do you gain,
what do you lose?' " It's exactly this sense of
awareness that the Silk Road Project hopes to
engender through performance, and it is their
greatest accomplishment as a musical force.
Lam spoke of Ma's Project endeavor as
"humanitarian." On his website, Ma is quoted
as saying, "There is no tradition that exists that
was not the result of successful and sustained
innovation."
In gathering disparate artists already expert
in established traditions, and encouraging
recombination, Ma pursues a humanitarian
effort: making room for creative seedlings in
the crowded status quo.

PAPER FRAME
From page 1B
laborator of Charlene Kaye's, sang with Kaye in
the video and also enjoyed the working dynamic
the team had on set.
"When you're doing these kind of things,
whether it be putting on a play or shooting a
video in a student environment where no one's
really getting paid, it's all just for the sake of fun
and creating something," Criss said.
The video was eventually screened through
M-agination Films, a student-run film group, but
Thom, Mark and Liann were still working inde-
pendently. The decision to actually form Paper
Frame Productions and consolidate the group's
work under a single banner was less motivatedby
profit and more by a desire to develop a distinct
identity and connect with other people in the
creative community. And as Mark notes, "You
have to have a name to do that."
For Paper Frame Productions, the decision
already looks to be paying off. Since the "Skin and
Bones" video, the group has done commercials
and video work for MUSKET, the student-run
musical theater group, and has upcoming video
shoots with local electro-pop group My Dear
Disco and singer-songwriter Danny Freeman.
After releasing the first videos online this Janu-
ary with the official Paper Frame Productions
name attached, the group received offers from sev-
eral bands to film their live shows. Even the work
with MUSKET came about thanks to the "Skin

and Bones" shoot, as one of the stagehands for the
video, MT&D sophomore Josh Beurer, worked for
MUSKET and asked if they could collaborate.
To all three members, the interconnected
nature of the Ann Arbor arts community has
been beneficial. The group has called on a net-
work of friends and contacts - ranging from
writers, dancers, actors and bands - to help out
with Paper Frame projects. In turn, Paper Frame
Productions is more than willing to do the same
for their contacts.
"We wouldn't have anything to shoot if there
wasn't a music scene in Ann Arbor," Thom said.
"It helps that it's a really good, strong music
scene and it gives us an opportunity to actually
work with good artists and make a product that's
actually decent and something people would want
to watch even if they aren't familiar with the art-
ist," Thom continued. "It also helps us to actually
want to put out a high quality product ourselves."
As the night ends, the team behind Paper
Frame Productions leaves the deli with an espe-
cially busy agenda ahead of them. The "Magnolia
Wine" video is shooting this weekend, and two
days from now, Paper Frame will be filming a live
show at the Blind Pig. Nevertheless, the ambition
and vision that fueled Paper Frame Production's
growth in these past two months is still plentiful.
"People - creative people especially - want to
be a part of something," Mark said. "So the pro-
duction company isn't so much a company in that
we're trying to make money or be a business, at
least not at this stage, but so we can just organize
projects and have an outlet for creativity for us
and for our friends."

A cold day in Hollywood hell

By RACHEL HANDLER
Daily Arts Writer
You know things have taken a turn
for the worse when Oprah is funnier
than Ellen DeGeneres. I learned this
tragic truth over spring break in L.A.,
when I had the distinct pseudo-honor
of being an audience member for both
daytime talk show queens. I say pseu-
do-honor because being in a talk show
audience is essentially ahumblingexpe-
rience. After clapping on cue, practicing
laughing, dancing frenetically between
commercials and being moved in and
out of seats according to attractiveness,
one feels less like a human and more
like a circus monkey. But I performed
accordingly, hoping to at least produce
an interesting story.
Monday was Oprah's after-Oscar
special at the Kodak Theatre. My
mom and I were VIPs, which we later
learned meant nothing. Oprah was
slated to interview the Oscar winners
post-post-party, before many even had
a chance to sleep. Scandal and intrigue
felt imminent. Yet none of this seemed
worth it at the ungodly arrival time of

5:30 a.m. We came, we saw, we parked,
we waited. While waiting, I learned a
few things. One: Even regulars on CBS
detective shows have to wait in line for
Oprah. Two: If a VIP falls in the forest,
but everyone else is also a VIP, no one
really gives a shit.
Five hours after my brutal wake-
up call, I stumbled, half-dead, into the
Kodak.
First up: Hugh Jackman, large and
clean-shaven. Always combating those
Oprah vs. Ellen:
who's funnier?

took three more imaginary shots and
sat down, thinking things couldn't get
much worse. But five minutes later, my
mother ended up dancing on stage alone
for three minutes in hopes of winning a
T-shirt. I learned a third lesson here: In
the real world, T-shirts aren't so heavily
commoditized. But in the world of the
talk show audience, they are luxuries
worthy of self-exploitation.
Finally, Ellen entered the stu-
dio, a ray of golden sunshine. Relief
descended over the audience as we
were finally allowed to sit down and
stop awkwardly shaking our imagi-
nary Mardi Gras beads. Until we were
told she'd be refraining from her usual
parade through the aisles, and had to
push Fabio from "Top Chef" to tomor-
row's show. Hopelessness ensued.
Ellen's first guest was a woman who
had stopped a burglar by giving him a
wedgie. I waited for the witty repartee,
for Ellen's biting commentary - but
there was none. Between takes, she sat
forlornly in her chair while a team of
makeup artists dusted away at her fore-
head. A phone callto Sean Penn began a
lengthy,mutualpat onthe back between
the two in which they congratulated
one another for being proponents of
the gay rights movement. Denise Rich-
ards moaned about her hard-knock life
while simultaneously whoring out her
reality series and children. And stun-
ningly, Ellen didn't make fun of her.
Rather, she commiserated.
At the end of the show, Ellen stood
and thanked the audience, almost
apologetically. We sat in shared, hor-
rified silence. Had that really just hap-
pened? Had Ellen and Denise Richards
just bonded? My mother and I quickly
invented stories for her. "Her back
hurts." "She's probably sick." "Maybe
she's fighting with Portia!"
As we trudged forlornly out of the
studio, I decided that the entire expe-
rience had been sort of surreal. When
Oprah can crack jokes about her finan-
cial status between commercials -
"When you're rich, people adjust your
shirt for you" - but Ellen can barely
crack a smile. When celebrities are
chipper at 10 a.m. after the Oscars and
a still-drunk Sean Penn doesn't even
make an off-color remark, the uni-
verse feels out of whack. Perhaps I had
somehow entered the "Twilight Zone"
without realizing it. Shit got weird that
week in L.A., and I wanted a refund. I
couldn't catch a break, though - our
tickets had been free.
