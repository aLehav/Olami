Wesleyan 
University 

President 
Michael 
S. 
Roth 
visited the Michigan Union 
Thursday morning to discuss 
controversial college campus 
topics, including free speech, 
affirmative action and political 
correctness. 
Approximately 
100 administrators, faculty and 
graduate and doctoral students 
attended the event. 
The lecture, “Safe Enough 
Spaces: A Pragmatist’s Approach 
to Inclusion, Free Speech, and 
Political Correctness on College 
Campuses,” was named after 
Roth’s newest book. The event 
was part of the National Center 
for 
Institutional 
Diversity 
Research 
and 
Scholarship 
Seminar 
Series 
featuring 
academics 
who 
focus 
on 
historical 
and 
contemporary 
social 
issues 
surrounding 
identity, 
representation 
and 
inequality, and how research 
and scholarship can address 
these issues.
Alford 
Young, 
sociology 
and African-American studies 
professor, introduced Roth and 
his new book, praising his ability 
to present current issues at 
Wesleyan in his books. 

More 
than 
50 
Asian 
and 
Pacific 
Islander 
American-identifying 
students convened for A/
PIA Womxn: Stereotypes 
and Double Standards, a 
discussion 
about 
topics 
surrounding issues facing 
the 
A/PIA 
identities. 
Sponsored by United Asian 
Americans 
Organizations 
and alpha Kappa Delta Phi, 
an Asian-interest sorority, 
the event was held in the 
Yuri Kochiyama Lounge in 
South Quad Residence Hall 
and featured informational 
slides to supplement the 
dialogue. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
word 
“womxn” was included to 
make the event inclusive 
to women who identify as 
transgender and non-binary. 
Attendees 
were 
split 
up 
into six groups and asked 
to share their opinions and 
experiences 
about 
A/PIA 
identity.
UAAO Co-Chair Cristina 
Guytingco, an LSA junior, 
said the event was valuable 
for creating a safe space for 
different perspectives.

Susan M. Collins, former 
dean of the Ford School of 
Public 
Policy, 
was 
named 
acting provost of the University 
of 
Michigan 
Thursday 
morning. This announcement 
comes after Martin Philbert 
was placed on leave last week 
following multiple allegations 
of sexual misconduct.
Collins, 
who 
currently 
serves as a professor in the 
Ford School and LSA, will 
assume the post immediately. 
In an email to The Daily, 
Collins said she was eager to 
take on the new role.
“I am grateful for this 
opportunity to serve the 
university 
community,” 
Collins 
wrote. 
“My 
immediate 
focus 
will 
be 
supporting 
the 
important 
academic-focus of the Office 
of the Provost, which touches 
the lives of all our students, 
members 
of 
the 
faculty 
and those who support our 
academic enterprise.”
University President Mark 
Schlissel told The University 
Record he was grateful to 

Collins for agreeing to fill the 
position.
“I’m incredibly appreciative 
of 
Dr. 
Collins 
and 
her 
willingness 
to 
accept 
this 
crucial appointment,” Schlissel 
said. “With a decade of service 
as the Ford School’s dean and 
experience partnering with 
the Office of the Provost, she 
is well positioned to lead the 
office at this challenging time.”
In an interview with The 
Daily on Tuesday, Schlissel 
noted 
the 
importance 
of 
ensuring University hires do 
not have a history of sexual 
misconduct. He shared a need 
to have someone with an 
understanding of the role and 
previous experience in higher 
education.
“In 
terms 
of 
moving 
forward, the University, you 
know, really has to have a 
provost in place,” Schlissel said 
on Tuesday. “Right now, I’m in 
the process of looking at people 
who 
have 
administrative 
experience 
and 
familiarity, 
because they sort of have to 
take over all at once, although 
I’ll be working with them very 
closely.”

Fred 
Korematsu 
Day 
commemorates 
Fred 
Korematsu, 
a 
Japanese 
American who was one of the 
many victims of anti-Japanese 
sentiments during and after 
World 
War 
II. 
In 
honor 
of this day, the Michigan 
Asian 
Pacific 
American 
Affairs Commission and Stop 
Repeating History organized a 
screening of the documentary, 
“Alternative Facts: The Lies 
of Executive Order 9066,” 
and a panel at the University 
of 
Michigan 
Law 
School 
Thursday evening. About 75 
people attended the event.
President Roosevelt signed 

Executive 
Order 
9066 
in 
1942, which authorized the 
incarceration of more than 
120,000 Japanese Americans 
in internment camps. The 
basis of that order was partial 
evidence 
that 
Japanese 
Americans were committing 
espionage to benefit wartime 
enemies, 
which 
was 
later 
proven false. 
Fred 
Korematsu 
was 
arrested 
after 
resisting 
incarceration. He appealed 
his case in the Supreme Court. 
While he originally lost his 
case, 
his 
conviction 
was 
overturned in 1983. 
On Thursday, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer declared Jan. 30, 
2020 Fred Korematsu Day 
in Michigan, following the 

example of other states. 
Donald Tamaki, a partner 
at Minami Tamaki LLP and 
attorney for Fred Korematsu 
during the hearings, explained 
in an interview with The 
Daily that events leading up 
to the Korematsu case mirror 
modern-day events, such as 
Trump’s Muslim Ban and the 
border crisis. 
“If 
no 
one 
will 
check 
the president … then (the 
president) can do anything 
it wants with respect to 
immigration 
by 
invoking 
national 
security,” 
Tamaki 
said. “Whether it is separating 
children from their families 
or locking people for an 
indeterminate 
sentence, 
refusing to consider valid 

asylum claims.”
Karen Korematsu, founder 
and 
executive 
director 
of the Fred T. Korematsu 
Institute and daughter of Fred 
Korematsu, said it’s important 
to 
hold 
the 
government 
accountable to end the cycle 
of fear that has led to so 
many instances of targeted 
discrimination.
“These are the kind of issues 
we want the general public to 
be aware of,” Korematsu said. 
“If people do not participate 
in making a change in this 
country by not voting and 
not being a part of the census 
then we are going to still keep 
making the same mistakes.”

Chants of “Four more years” 
and “U-S-A” filled the warehouse 
of Dana Incorporated, an auto 
parts manufacturing company 
located in Warren, Mich., from 
hundreds of employees and 
Trump supporters. The crowd 
gathered to hear President 
Donald Trump discuss trade in 
his second visit to Michigan in 
the last two months. 
Trump’s 
visit 
to 
the 
manufacturing plant comes a 
day after signing the United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement 
into 
law. 
The 

deal is considered a revised 
and updated version of the 
North American Free Trade 
Agreement, and its passing 
fulfills one of Trump’s biggest 
2016 campaign promises. The 
newly signed deal was the 
main reason for Trump’s visit 
to Dana Incorporated, he said.
“The USMCA is the most 
fairest, balanced and beneficial 
trade deal we’ve ever signed 
into law,” Trump said in his 
speech 
to 
the 
warehouse. 
“We’re bringing jobs back to 
America, better jobs are coming 
back, and they’re coming back 
fast and they’re coming right 
here to Michigan.” 

A revision in the updated 
pact requires that 75 percent 
of a vehicle must be made in 
North America, in an effort 
to help the U.S. automotive 
industry. This is an increase 
from 62.5 percent in NAFTA. 
. The deal also contains a 
provision that mandates 70 
percent of a vehicle’s metal 
and aluminum to come from a 
country in North America.
Trump’s visit to Dana Inc. 
in Warren is his first visit to 
the state in 2020, and the first 
since holding a rally in Battle 
Creek on Dec. 18. Warren is in 
Macomb County, Michigan’s 
third-largest county and an 

area Trump won in 2016.
Dana Inc. is a manufacturing 
company that supplies various 
parts for conventional, hybrid 
and electric-powered vehicles, 
including axles, transmissions, 
sealing and digital equipment 
among other products geared 
towards 
the 
production 
of 
electric-powered vehicles. 
The 
event 
opened 
with 
remarks from Dana Inc. CEO 
James Kamsickas, who talked 
about 
Dana’s 
long 
history 
of producing auto parts for 
various types of cars and U.S. 
military tanks. 


Thursday night kicked off 
the ninth annual Sustainable 
Ann Arbor forum, a series of 
monthly events from January 
to April focused on the city’s 
Sustainability 
Framework 
hosted by the Ann Arbor 
District Library. 

This 
month’s 
forum 
focused on the energy sector, 
with a panel of five experts 
in the field of sustainable 
energy each presenting on 
their 
respective 
areas 
of 
focus. About 60 community 
members attended the event.
Josh 
MacDonald, 
the 
city’s 
energy 
coordinator, 
moderated the panel and 
began with a presentation 
about A2Zero, an initiative by 

the city of Ann Arbor to work 
towards the city’s goal of 
achieving carbon neutrality 
by 
2030. 
MacDonald 
explained how the group 
plans to combine community 
feedback, 
technology 
advisory 
committees 
and 
partner 
organizations 
to 
develop a finalized plan that 
will be presented to City 
Council in March. 
“This 
involves 
the 
community 
directly, 
so 
we want to make sure that 
whatever we’re doing, we’re 
constantly getting feedback 
from 
the 
community,” 
MacDonald 
said. 
“It 
not 
only helps us to get a sense 
of what you all are thinking 
as far as greenhouse gas 
reductions, it also helps us to 
introduce these ideas to you 
and get feedback as to what 
you think about them.”
A2Zero hosted a town hall 
in November and has put 
out two surveys so far for 
community feedback. The 
second town hall and final 
survey will take place in 
February. 
Following 
MacDonald’s 
introduction, each panelist 
gave a presentation on their 
work 
with 
A2Zero 
and 
explained their individual 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
carbon 
neutrality. 
Panelists 
represented 
a 
variety 
of 
interests 
related 
to 
the 
energy 
sector 
from 
the 
state, DTE Energy and the 
University of Michigan. 
Chuck 
Hookham, 
a 
member of the Ann Arbor 
Energy 
Commission 
and 
the 
Michigan 
Board 
of 
Professional 
Engineers, 
presented on viable steps 
the energy sector can take 
to 
move 
toward 
carbon 
neutrality. He discussed the 
obstacles posed by the design 

of the infrastructure of Ann 
Arbor’s 
current 
energy 
system and the difficulties of 
adapting that system to more 
renewable energy.
“We’re trying to move as 
quick as we can,” Hookham 
said. 
“We 
have 
to 
keep 
your rates low — I don’t 
think anyone wants twice 
the electric bill, do you? I 
don’t think anybody wants 
interruption 
of 
heating 
in 
their 
house. 
These 
transitions we take on have 
to be done prudently but 
quickly, because we all know 
we don’t have much time.”
Susan 
Fancy, 
program 
manager for research and 
commercialization 
at 
the 
University’s 
Global 
CO2 
Initiative, spoke about what 
institutions can do to reduce 
their carbon footprint, giving 
examples of initiatives at the 
University and other colleges 
nationwide. 
Fancy’s recommendations 
included 
forgoing 
fossil 
fuels, upgrading buildings 
to low-emissions standards 
and creating a culture of 
sustainability. 
She 
also 
spoke 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
restructuring 
energy 
systems with social justice in 
mind. 
“Our 
current 
energy 
systems are really regressive, 
at least historically they have 
been; 
unfortunately, 
the 
emissions and what-have-
you tend to hit the people 
with the smallest voice and 
the 
smallest 
pocketbook,” 
Fancy said. “And so as we 
reinvent 
the 
emissions 
systems, it’s really important 
to do that through the lens of 
social justice so that we don’t 
repeat that mistake.”

“We got to be in the press room, talk to a lot of other local journalists, 
which was really cool because it was nice to hear about the 
experiences of other reporters from around Michigan. It was a short 
and sweet speech, but Whitmer covered a lot of issues and topics in

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
We have to look as carefully as we can of the people we 
hire to make sure that the likelihood of hiring people that have 
committed misconduct in the past or may commit it in the 
future is as low as possible ... we’ve got to figure out how to do 
this better to figure out, how to set up a culture where this type 
of misbehavior, this category of misbehavior is not tolerated, 
that people feel comfortable to report it and to ask for help.”

THE 18TH ANNUAL

DIMITRI AND IRMGARD PALLAS LECTURE 
IN MODERN GREEK STUDIES


Collins was the Joan and 
Sanford Weill Dean of Public 
Policy for 10 years. When she 
left her post in 2017, Collins 
described 
her 
efforts 
to 
improve the school’s visibility 
in a farewell letter.
“I was a really staunch 
supporter that you don’t talk 
until you have something to 
say — you don’t want to be 
known as the wind bag; you 
want to be known for having 
done the analysis, for having 
depth of understanding of 
what the challenges are,” 
Collins wrote. “It’s one of 
the 
reasons 
I’ve 
always 
cared about having a foot in 
academia, because that’s one 
of the things academics stand 
for.”
Collins also sits on the 
Board of Directors for the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
Chicago and is a research 
associate 
at 
the 
National 
Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Research. 
She 
is 
also 
a 
member of the Council on 

Foreign Relations.
She 
holds 
a 
bachelor’s 
degree 
in 
economics 
from 
Harvard 
University 
and a doctorate from the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. She has taught 
at Harvard and Georgetown 
University, 
during 
which 
time she was also a senior 
fellow 
at 
The 
Brookings 
Institution.
Currently, Collins oversees 
a global engagement seminar 
that takes 15 undergraduates 
to 
Costa 
Rica 
to 
study 
prevalent policy issues in the 
Central American country. 
In a message to students, she 
confirmed she will continue 
to teach the course and will 
still travel with the class to 
Costa Rica over spring break.
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Brianna 
Wells 
took 
the 
course 
with 
Collins 
last 
year. Wells said she found 
Collins to be personable and 
is excited for her to take on 
the role.
“She definitely pushes you 
to be a better student and 
has really high standards for 
quality,” Wells said. “For part 
of the class we went to Costa 

Rica over spring break and 
she’s a really great professor 
in the classroom, but then I 
just realized how good of a 
person she is on a personal 
level. She’s very kind, very 
understanding 
and 
cares 
about students.”
As acting provost, Collins 
fills the position Philbert 
vacated earlier this month. 
Philbert 
was 
placed 
on 
administrative leave Jan. 21 
after multiple allegations of 
sexual assault were reported 
to the University on Jan. 
16-17. An investigation is 
currently underway.
The provost is the second-
highest ranking official at 
the University and the chief 
academic officer. The provost 
works with the president to 
determine the University’s 
academic goals and distribute 
resources 
to 
achieve 
these 
goals. 
The 
provost 
previously 
oversaw 
the 
Office of Institutional Equity, 
which 
investigates 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations, 
though this duty has been 
moved to Richard S. Holcomb, 
associate vice president for 
Human Resources.

TRUMP
From Page 1

“What I find particularly 
important is President Roth, 
as he has done consistently 
throughout his career, writes 
to his audiences, not about 
problems that are solved, but 
issues that he serves in real-
time,” Young said.
Roth 
began 
his 
talk 
by 
explaining the title of his book 
and lecture, defining what “safe 
enough” spaces were to him as a 
university president. 
“A safe enough space at a 
college or university is a space 
in which students are going to 
not be subject to harassment and 
intimidation,” Roth said. “But 
not so safe that you go to class 
and you never contribute.” 
Roth 
wrote 
his 
book 
as 
a 
defense 
of 
students 
who 
protest speakers on campus, 
who critique professors with 
differing opinions and who serve 
as activists on college campuses 
fighting 
for 
marginalized 
groups. He said these students 
are often criticized for placing 
too much emphasis on political 
correctness and social justice, 
but 
he 
disagrees 
with 
this 
characterization.
“People like to make fun of 
this stuff,” Roth said. “I’ve read 
so many books that criticize 
college students, especially this 
generation of students, and they 
criticize them in such a way that 
the picture is unrecognizable to 
me … I see a lot of students in my 
class when they come to protest 
my decisions or my lack of 
decisions. Even when they came 
to protest, I just didn’t recognize 
this caricature of the ‘snowflake’ 
or the ‘intolerant social justice 
warrior.’” 
Roth also criticized professors 

who feel threatened by students 
protesting 
their 
courses 
or 
protesting university decisions, 
pointing out professors have 
a duty to work with and teach 
all students no matter their 
opinions. 
“I do think when you start 
complaining about students as 
a professor, you’ve got to start 
planning your retirement,” Roth 
said. “Because you get the cards 
you get, you don’t get to complain 
about your students. You figure 
out how to teach them.”
He also dove into political 
correctness on campuses. Roth 
noted all presidents from the 
President George H.W. Bush 
forward 
gave 
speeches 
on 
political correctness, using the 
concept as a weapon. 
“It’s 
just 
something 
you 
use against your enemies,” he 
said. “It’s weaponized. Trump 
brought that forward in a really 
dramatic way during the primary 
campaign. When there was a 
question he didn’t like, he’d say 
political correctness was killing 
our country, and this seems to 
work because there is a view … 
that what happens to colleges 
and universities is a kind of 
hothouse 
environment 
where 
professors can indoctrinate their 
students.” 
In response to this view, 
Roth said he has yet to meet one 
professor aiming to indoctrinate 
their students in a course. At the 
same time, he said professors 
want to have the freedom and 
right to teach what they want in 
their courses. 
“There is a tension there 
because, after all, professors 
should have academic freedom 
to teach their courses in the way 
they want to,” Roth said. “They 
certainly react to pressure from 
students 
to 
change 
courses, 
sometimes from pressure from 

administrators... but they do 
insist that even if someone has an 
intention, they have the right to 
teach their course a certain way.”
To 
end 
his 
talk, 
Roth 
emphasized higher education as a 
public good, encouraging faculty, 
educators and administrators to 
widen their lenses, particularly 
in intellectual diversity. 
“If we take diversity of ideas 
that we cultivate on campus 
and increase the ability of our 

neighbors, and others who live 
in this country, to work together 
to solve more problems, I think 
we’d be doing a great service to 
the country,” Roth said.
Rackham student Jeffrey Grim 
attended the lecture as an affiliate 
of NCID to hear a university 
president’s perspective on free 
speech on college campuses. 
“From a scholarly and practical 
standpoint, and I thought it’d be 
interesting to hear,” Grim said. 

“I’ve heard scholars talk about 
it, I’ve heard practitioners … it 
was helpful to hear a perspective 
from a college president who 
is intellectually interested in 
this, but also has to manage an 
institution.”
Grim 
said 
he 
appreciated 
Roth’s discussion of the impact 
outside forces can have on 
on-campus issues.
“His 
overall 
speech 
kind 
of talked about institutional 

context matters, how political 
climate and personal background 
matters,” Grim said. “When 
we’re thinking about the impact 
it has on people, the impact 
speech has on people. Another 
takeaway was thinking about 
the role of executive leaders or 
leaders on college campuses and 
promoting different types of 
views and perspectives and the 
structures that come along with 
that.”

He 
also 
expressed 
his 
excitement 
with 
both 
the 
USMCA and Trump’s choice 
of the warehouse as his first 
stop after signing the deal 
into law yesterday. 
“Many 
are 
aware 
that 
we are a strong supporter 
of 
USMCA,” 
Kamsickas 
said. “We’re excited to host 
President Trump and the 
first official White House 
event following 
signing 
(USMCA) into 
law, 
and 
to 
hear from him 
directly on a 
topic 
that 
is 
important 
for 
our 
company 
and 
for 
our 
industry.” 
Trump began 
his speech by 
promoting the 
newly 
signed 
trade deal and 
continued 
to 
boast 
about 
it 
throughout 
the approximately 30-minute 
speech. He noted the deal’s 
projected ability to create 
approximately 80,000 auto 
manufacturing jobs. 
“The 
USMCA 
is 
an 
especially 
big 
win 
for 
American 
auto 
workers,” 
Trump said. “We’re producing 
jobs like we’ve never seen 
before. We’re producing jobs. 
So I just want to say that I’ve 
kept my promise.” 
Trump 
also 
mentioned 
other provisions of the deal 
that are aimed to create more 
auto industry jobs in North 
America, 
strengthen 
labor 
laws in Mexico and allow for 
more trade between Mexican, 
Canadian and American wine 

and cheese products. 
He wrapped up his speech 
by sharing why he felt the 
Dana Inc. warehouse was the 
perfect place for him to speak. 
“Dana Corp. is the perfect 
place to honor the immortal 
legacy 
of 
the 
American 
worker,” Trump said. “I just 
want to congratulate all of 
the people at Dana. You have 
all been outstanding and it 
really is the great people right 
now — the great people that 
work here — those people that 
can do such precision work. 
You’re the ones that are doing 

it, and you’re the ones in our 
country and the people who 
we have great respect for.”
Congressman Andy Levin, 
D-Bloomfield 
Township, 
posted a video to his Facebook 
page 
criticizing 
Trump’s 
policies prior to his visit, 
saying the policies negatively 
affect the working class.
“I’ve looked at this in great 
detail,” Levin said in the 
video. “I wish I were wrong, 
but I’m afraid to tell you that 
the USMCA is gonna continue 
the stream of U.S. jobs, middle 
class jobs, good paying jobs 
in manufacturing, down to 
Mexico where they’re turned 
into super low-wage jobs.”
Mark 
Arrowsmith, 

longtime Dana Inc. employee, 
spoke to The Daily after the 
event about his excitement for 
USMCA and Trump’s choice 
to come to Dana to talk about 
the new trade deal.
“I 
was 
excited 
about 
(USMCA) because I’ve been 
a manufacturer for over 42 
years and to see (jobs) come 
back to Michigan and the 
United States, really makes 
me 
excited,” 
Arrowsmith 
said. “The biggest challenge 
was getting workers back in 
here because manufacturing 
was almost a lost trade where 
people didn’t 
want 
to 
do 
it, but more 
people 
now 
seem 
like 
they 
want 
to get back 
into it. Dana 
has a history 
with building 
tanks, 
so 
I 
think 
this 
was a good 
setting 
for 
him to talk 
about 
the 
trade (deal).”
LSA 
freshman 
Nicholas Schuler, freshman 
chair 
of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
said 
he 
was 
happy with Trump’s decisions 
to leave NAFTA and visit 
Michigan, though he did not 
attend the speech.
“He is keeping in touch 
with the people who got 
him elected — they love 
him, he loves them,” Schuler 
said. “The trade deal was so 
important because NAFTA 
was an American job killer. 
Plain and simple. It made our 
labor market less competitive 
and a more America friendly 
trade agreement was needed.”

In an interview with The 
Daily, Korematsu spoke on 
the legacy of her father and 
the message she hopes Fred 
Korematsu Day will impart 
to the public. 
“You 
have 
to 
say 
something 
in 
order 
to 
make 
that 
difference,” 
Korematsu said. “It’s about 
courage. It took courage 
for the coram nobis legal 
team to reopen the case. 
It’s about upholding and 

abiding by the civil liberties 
in the constitution. Our 
democracy is at risk.”
LSA 
freshman 
Haneen 
Tout 
said 
 
her 
biggest 
takeaway from the event 
was how necessary it is to 
look back.
“All these things that 
have happened in the past 
are there for us to see and 
learn from,” Tout said. “The 
Supreme 
Court 
and 
the 
government seem like they 
are choosing to look back on 
these things.”
LSA 
freshman 
Grace 
Stephan also commented 

on what students can do 
regarding the issues brought 
up during the event. 
“As students, we should 
stay educated about issues,” 
Stephan said. “Going out 
of your way and learning 
things from people who 
have different experiences 
than 
you 
and 
maybe 
that’s novels, movies or 
attending events like these. 
People who have had these 
experiences and have lived 
them, which I think is the 
most meaningful way of 
getting involved.”

“We 
thought 
it 
was 
important to have a dialogue 
surrounding A/PIA women in 
the community,” Guytingco 
said. 
“Coming 
from 
an 
intersectional context and 
viewpoint, we thought it’d 
be cool to have this dialogue 
about stereotypes and what 
it is to be an A/PIA woman 
within these contexts.”
Co-Chair Michelle Byun, 
an LSA freshman, moderated 
the event and set the norms 
for everyone to follow when 
discussing sensitive topics. 
Presentation topics included 
racism, 
sexism, 
historical 
stereotypes, 
discrimination 
and colorism.
During 
the 
group 
discussions, 
students 
discussed 
the 
“model 
minority” myth surrounding 
the A/PIA community. Other 
experiences 
brought 
up 
include being asked “Where 
are you from?”, racialized 
catcalling and fetishizing of 
multiracial babies. 
Byun talked about colorism, 
specifically mentioning skin 
lightening 
products 
and 
beauty 
stereotypes. 
Other 
attendees brought up the 

different beauty standards 
in America compared to Asia 
and 
how 
the 
differences 
of 
skin 
color 
between 
siblings has impacted their 
experiences as an A/PIA. 
Students 
who 
were 
A/
PIA and also identified with 
another identity discussed 
the 
intersectionality 
that 
exists within their cultures 
and how this impacts their 
experience as a person of 
color. Business sophomore 
Sarah Morgan said she was 
able to share her perspective 
as 
a 
biracial 
Black 
and 
Filipino woman, which was 
unique 
compared 
to 
the 
majority of the attendees at 
the event.
“As 
a 
bi-racial 
Asian 
woman, I decided to come 
because I knew this would be 
a good opportunity to speak 
on 
my 
experiences 
with 
my 
Filipino 
background,” 
Morgan said. “I really enjoyed 
talking about the stereotypes 
because as a Black person, 
I was able to talk about the 
model minority myth as well 
as colorism that I’ve seen in 
the Filipino community. I was 
able to bring that perspective 
into 
the 
group 
dialogue 
tonight.”
During the presentation, 
many 
examples 
of 

misrepresentation of A/PIA 
womxn were shared with the 
audience. One example was 
the dragon lady stereotype 
and lotus flower stereotype, 
depicting that womxn were 
either seductive or easily 
seduced. 
Students 
shared 
examples of discriminatory 
incidents within a personal, 
professional and academic 
setting. 
Co-Chair Dim Mang, an 
LSA senior, said the event 
was not meant to represent 
all perspectives within the A/
PIA community, but rather to 
start a dialogue among those 
who have something to share.
“I think the event went 
really well. We tried to be 
very aware of the fact that 
especially 
when 
you’re 
talking about a community as 
diverse as Asian Americans, 
you can’t cover every topic 
well and you can’t cover 
every facet well,” Mang said. 
“Something that we wanted 
to be really conscious of was 
using our own experiences 
and not trying to speak for 
other voices and experiences. 
In those terms, I think it went 
really well and we’re really 
trying to improve as the 
semester goes.”

Your Canada Goose is uglier than it looks

I 

love 
Nicholas 
Cage. 
From 
his 
melodramatic 
performance alongside Cher 
in “Moonstruck” to his laughable 
screaming of “not the bees!” in 
“The Wicker Man,” his movies are 
iconic. While I am excited to see his 
new film, based on H.P. Lovecraft’s 
“Colours Out of Space,” at the State 
Theatre, I highly doubt it will surpass 
the brilliance of 2004’s “National 
Treasure.” Like “The Da Vinci Code” 
for fifth graders, it’s two hours of 
dumb fun that begin with Sean Bean 
and Cage, in all his mouthbreathing 
glory, riding across a sea of snow.
As I watched the movie over 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend 
for the first time in a decade, I was 
surprised to see Cage and Bean 
(who somehow survives the movie) 
wearing bright red Canada Goose 
parkas. Founded in 1957 as a jacket 
for Northern Canadians, Canada 
Goose’s parkas are designed to keep 
a person alive in temperatures as low 
as -30 degrees Celsius. In the 1980s, it 
became the iconic jacket of Antarctic 
researchers and the first Canadian to 
reach the summit of Mount Everest. 
Now, it’s the jacket of the rich and 
famous. 
The blue and red logo has been 
seen on dozens of celebrities, ranging 
from Kevin Bacon and Aubrey Plaza 
to a topless Kate Upton, who donned 
one of their parkas on a cover of 
Sports Illustrated magazine to the 
delight of teenage boys everywhere. 
Their parkas not only look like 
sleeping bags, but are described as 
“like wearing a sleeping bag” on 
elite fashion blogs. Even so, the lack 
of style hasn’t hindered them from 
becoming the new status symbol 
among America’s upper class. Most 
versions are priced at over $1,000 
if you get it from a certified seller, 
the only way to ensure it isn’t a fake 
stuffed with German Shepard hair. 
Their increasing popularity has 
been to the financial gain of past 
presidential candidate Sen. Mitt 
Romney, R-Ut., whose former private 
equity firm, Bain Capital, owns a 
majority of stock in the company. 
While I could go on endlessly about 
these implications alone, the jackets 
are most infamous for their coyote 
fur hoods. 
Predictably, people unabashedly 
wearing fur has brought the ire 

of PETA, who released a video 
of distressed coyotes in traps, 
protesting the company’s fur use. 
Canada Goose has fired back by 
saying their trapping of coyotes 
is in accordance with Canada’s 
misleadingly named Agreement on 
International Humane Trapping 
Standards (AIHTS). This agreement 
allows coyotes to be captured using 
Duke No. 3 Rubber Jaws, which 
are banned in the EU for clamping 
down on the legs of animals, usually 
breaking them in the process. In 
the western United States, coyotes 
are then either shot in the head or 
bludgeoned to death, usually with a 
hammer, in accordance with state 
laws that vary greatly in what they 
consider humane. Most require 
a coyote to be trapped and killed 
within 24 hours, but states like 
Wyoming only require traps to be 
checked once every three days. “It’s 
horrible, to put it mildly,” says wildlife 
expert Stanley Gehrt in a Newsweek 
article regarding the controversy 
around the jackets. The coyotes 
often experience a mix of muscle 
damage and dehydration until their 
eventual death due to exposure to 
the elements or blood loss. 
Coyotes, 
which 
may 
form 
monogamous mating pairs like 
people, are also not subject to a 
hunting season in most western 
states, where Canada Goose gets 
their fur. This is done in most other 
fur-bearing species to reduce pup 
deaths, but this courtesy hasn’t been 
extended to these highly intelligent 
and social animals. Mother coyotes 
have even been known to chew their 
legs off in desperation to get back to 
their pups. With no way of knowing 
where the fur comes from, it can only 
be left to speculation how each jacket 
hood met its final moments. 
Some environmentalists have 
thrown their weight behind Canada 
Goose, citing the Western Coyote’s 
status as an overpopulated, native 
invader, thriving in new ranges 
where humans have extirpated 
wolves. This is posing an ecological 
threat to many North American 
biomes, as coyotes inhabit every 
single contiguous state in America. 
Even so, studies have found that 
areas with two-year coyote removal 
programs are back at pre-removal 
numbers within only eight months, 

indicating that hunting may be 
nothing more than a nonsense 
solution with unknown ecological 
implications.
This isn’t the only thing that puts 
the company’s claims of “ethical 
sourcing” in question. The reason 
their jackets can sustain such low 
temperatures is due to the fine 
Canadian Hutterite goose down in 
the jackets. According to Canada 
Goose, “Each ounce of down has 
approximately two million fluffy 
filaments that interlock and overlap 
to create insulating pockets of air, 
which is what keeps you warm.” 
PETA 
released 
another 
video, 
showing one of their supplier farms 
crushing and suffocating its geese as 
they sent them to a slaughterhouse. 
Canada Goose says there is no other 
way to make a jacket that endures 
arctic temperatures without making 
synthetic furs and feathers.
While cruel, animal fur and 
feathers 
are 
relatively 
carbon-
neutral compared to manufacturing 
synthetic alternatives. In order to 
keep people warm in the coldest 
places on Earth, the company’s use of 
animal products may be acceptable. 
This argument, however, merely 
justifies the use of animal products 
in the jackets for Arctic explorers 
and researchers, not Hollywood 
celebrities. Sure, researchers and 
Nicholas Cage need them on their 
Antarctic expeditions, but do the 
students that populate the streets 
outside South University Avenue’s 
luxury condos? 
While 
Michigan 
winters 
are known for their harshness, 
they don’t compare to the places 
where the jackets are necessary. 
At the University of Michigan, 
they are status symbols that 
happen to keep you warm. With 
ample ethical ways to stay warm 
in Michigan, there is no excuse 
to have a fur hood dangling 
over your face in 2020. At best, 
wearing Canada Goose supports 
Mitt Romney and the needless 
killing of coyotes and geese, and at 
worst, it supports unspeakable and 
inexcusable cruelty, making you 
look less like Kate Upton and more 
like Cruella De Vil.

Serving the underserved

“

No matter where you’re from, 
you belong here.” This is 
the powerful message with 
which University of 
Michigan students are 
welcomed upon arrival 
to the Center for the 
Education of Women 
(CEW+) website, or the 
respective building.
The first time I heard 
of CEW+ was at the end 
of the winter semester 
of my junior year, and 
while 
unknown 
to 
many, CEW+ is an 
incredible resource available to 
provide the space and support for 
advocacy initiatives to grow at the 
University. After learning more 
about the program, I took steps to 
involve myself with other strong and 
progressive women. This led me to 
conduct a focus group on women 
and 
marginalized 
communities 
in STEM departments at U-M 
with the support and guidance of 
CEW+. The results of this study 
will ultimately be incorporated into 
the COUNTS Toolkit for student 
success. COUNTS, the Council 
for Nontraditional Students, is 
responsible 
for 
addressing 
the 
importance of a strong community 
for nontraditional and underserved 
students at the University which 
includes, and is not limited to, 
student parents and caregivers.
COUNTS is an online Canvas 
module dedicated to increasing 
awareness about social identities 
in the classroom and educating 
University 
students 
about 
the 
nontraditional student population. 
CEW+’s upcoming initiative is a 
Toolkit meant to teach members 
of the U-M community how to 
navigate different student identities. 
By engaging with this Toolkit, 
University staff are eligible to 
receive funding in support of any 
new endeavors or attempts to better 
support and include nontraditional 
students in their courses and 
programs.
CEW+ 
passionately 
supports 
student-led efforts with the goal 
of improving the campus climate 
for all identities. The center even 
offers students the opportunity 
to apply for funding to implement 
programs or events geared toward 

increasing equity for nontraditional 
student populations. An example 
of this is the opportunity for U-M 
undergraduate student 
organizations to apply 
for $5,000 in funding 
through the Frances 
and 
Sydney 
Lewis 
Visiting Leaders Fund. 
Through the Frances 
and Sydney Lewis Fund, 
CEW+ partners with 
student organizations to 
bring women leaders to 
campus. 
From my work as 
a research assistant to Dr. Tiffany 
Marra, the director of CEW+, it is 
clear that CEW+ is committed to 
creating inclusive, accessible and safe 
educational spaces for undergraduate 
women 
and 
marginalized 
community 
members. 
Engaging 
in the classroom and attaining a 
productive learning experience is 
crucial to degree completion and 
student success. CEW+ is a resource 
that undergraduate students should 
be well-acquainted with, and the 
work that is accomplished here is 
of high impact in the U-M campus 
community. 
CEW+ works to empower women 
and underserved students at U-M by 
serving as an advocate and providing 
resources to help them reach their 
academic, financial and professional 
potential. During my junior year, a 
close friend of mine informed me that 
she had received emergency financial 
assistance from CEW+. Through 
the CEW+ counseling program, 
we are able to award Emergency 
Funds to assist with “unexpected 
financial emergencies that threaten 
to derail degree progress.” The intent 
here is to enable individuals to act 
independently and take control of 
their path. By way of workshops and 
events oriented around promoting 
leadership, career and personal 
development, CEW+ generates a 
safe and uplifting atmosphere for 
accomplishing goals and solving 
problems. Dr. Marra recommends 
that students attend a Midweek 
Mindfulness sit if they don’t feel 
comfortable pausing and reflecting 
on their experiences. Mindfulness 
meditations are 30 minute events 
designed to help people practice 
recentering 
themselves 
in 
the 

present. CEW+ also leads events 
and workshops to address the needs 
of students, including a workshop 
coming up on Feb. 5 titled, “‘Am 
I Good Enough?’ Yes, You Are!”, 
which will focus on self-doubt and 
impostor syndrome. These are 
the types of workshops that exist 
to uplift and motivate students to 
chase after their ambitions. CEW+ is 
committed to ensuring that student 
identities are a positive influence in 
the path to success at U-M rather 
than a hindrance or burden. 
Dr. Marra has discussed her 
passion for working and learning 
from the U-M community of 
women and nontraditional students. 
“Whether it be a student working 
full-time while taking 15 credits or 
a student caring for a loved one or 
a student fighting for the rights of 
DACA students knowing it may not 
lead to better results for himself, I am 
continually amazed by the grit and 
determination of students as they 
trail blaze their path through U-M,” 
said Marra. CEW+ redefines what 
it is that professional development 
means to U-M students. Professional 
development 
events 
at 
CEW+ 
involve stepping outside of your 
comfort zone as a component of 
growth. Taking a risk to be slightly 
uncomfortable can lead to a greater 
understanding 
of 
something 
that students may have felt to be 
unknown or intimidating initially. 
CEW+ is a resource that exists to 
serve U-M undergraduate students 
in the form of events, professional 
development and guidance — and 
it’s right at the disposal of your 
fingertips! To the U-M student 
population 
identifying 
with 
marginalized communities: CEW+ is 
here to foster that sense of belonging 
at Michigan and to support you in 
your educational endeavors. To 
student allies: take the challenge 
to 
diversify 
your 
perspectives 
and better your understanding of 
social identities on campus during 
Winter 2020 through CEW+ events 
and 
opportunities. 
Embody 
what CEW+ represents and ask 
yourself, what can I do better to 
support, include and celebrate the 
diversity of my peers?

Our Provost and sexual misconduct

I

n a sudden and surprising email sent to University of Michigan students on Jan. 22, 

President Mark Schlissel announced that Provost Martin Philbert had been placed 

on administrative leave after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced 

against him. This news came just a day after state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak, 

filed a sexual misconduct complaint against state Sen. Peter Lucido, R-Shelby Twp., for 

an encounter in November 2018 where Lucido inappropriately touched her very low on 

her back and made suggestive remarks.
T

hat filing came in the wake 
of Lucido’s inappropriate 
comments 
toward 
a 
young 
reporter, 
22-year-old 
Allison Donahue, on Jan. 14. In 
this interaction Lucidio said a 
group of high school boys “could 
have a lot of fun” with Donahue. 
These stories serve as a glaring 
reminder of the pervasive issue 
of sexual harassment by men in 
positions of power against the 
women around them.
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board stands in solidarity with 
those who have come forward 
over the past two weeks, and 
continue to encourage others 
to speak out when necessary. 
Coming 
from 
a 
newsroom 
comprised mostly of young, 
female, 
aspiring 
journalists, 
we support Donahue for her 
bravery in deciding to speak up 
about the incident. Too often, 
young women remain silent for 
fear of backlash or professional 
repercussions. Even McMorrow, 
an elected state official, felt at 
risk of losing her constituents’ 
support by coming forward, but 
was moved to speak out after 
hearing Donahue’s story. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
at 
the 
University are not immune to 
this systemic problem. In 2018, 
ABC 7 disclosed that reported 
cases of sexual assault and 
sexual harassment were up 61 
and 37 percent respectively on 
the U-M campus. The details 
of the claims against Philbert 
have not been made public, 
but from Schlissel’s email, we 
know that an investigation was 
immediately opened after the 
allegations were made, bringing 
in outside legal counsel. Three 

days later, Philbert was placed on 
paid leave. The Editorial Board 
commends 
Schlissel 
for 
the 
swift response and hopes this 
sets a new precedent, while also 
reiterating the importance of 
transparency in the proceedings.
Since activist Tarana Burke 
began the #MeToo movement in 
2006 and it later saturated the 
mainstream with Alyssa Milano 
and 
the 
Harvey 
Weinstein 
scandal, more women have been 
empowered to speak out. Equally 
as important is the need for 
unbiased tribunals to evaluate 
evidence in these cases, weighing 
this against personal claims. But 
beyond judicial bodies, this is 
an issue of culture. How do we 
instill the treatment of women 
into the minds of our young 
men? How does this treatment 
undermine our universal values 
or prop up our definitions of 
masculinity? Where is the line 
between friendly socialization 
and 
workplace 
harassment? 
It is our job as a community 
to continuously ask ourselves 
these questions. To change our 
culture, we will need empathetic 
thinkers who set their sights on 
communal well-being, even at 
the cost of social convenience. 
We will need courageous men 
and women who are ready 
to 
self-analyze 
the 
social 
constructions they have built 
around themselves. We will need 
leaders and the best.
Though instances of sexual 
harassment 
predominantly 
impact women, these behaviors 
and institutions exist at men’s 
expense as well. According to a 
2018 report from the Institute 
of Women’s Policy Research, 

men were the victims in 20 
percent of all sexual harassment 
charges. To change the culture 
we must encourage those who 
face sexual misconduct to speak 
up and reassure them that they 
will be heard and given the 
opportunity to support their 
case. Another imperative step is 
promoting female representation 
in positions of power to disrupt 
traditionally male dominated 
hierarchies. If a woman — 
instead of Harvey Weinstein — 
chaired one of the largest film 
studios in America, it’s likely 
many of these industry workers 
would have not fallen prey to 
Weinstein’s persecution.
We’d like to highlight the 
resources available to our readers 
in the event they are needed.

KODOTH


I make a habit of avoiding 
movie theaters. Among other 
more important reasons, I 
really don’t enjoy other people 
telling me how and when to 
react. 
Misplaced 
laughter 
and 
overzealous 
reactions 
ruin 
a 
movie 
experience 
for me, almost as must as 
cliches 
and 
far-fetched 
storylines. The experience of 
watching “Uncle Frank” was 
an unfortunate mix of all of 
these.
“Uncle Frank” is the type 
of movie that is sure to bring 
in crowds. It boasts big-name 
director Alan Ball (“True 
Blood”) and main lead Paul 
Bettany, pulled straight from 
the 
Marvel 
Cinematic 
Universe. 
Even the plot 
is enticing: a 
closeted 
gay 
NYU professor 
from the South 
must confront 
his past and his 
identity when 
he 
and 
his 
niece at NYU 
take a roadtrip 
back home for 
his 
father’s 
funeral. 
At 
face value the 
film promises to be touching, 
riveting 
and 
profound. 
Instead, it is disappointing.
For 
a 
movie 
featuring 
heavy topics such as suicide 
and sexuality in the ’70s, 
“Uncle Frank” barely lets 
a poignant moment go by 
without 
punctuating 
the 
suspense with a laugh. Most 
of this humor comes from 
Peter Macdissi (“Six Feet 

Under”), who nails his role 
as Wally, Frank’s partner 
of 10 years. But Macdissi’s 

impressive 
performance 
could not compensate for the 
poorly-written character he 
had to portray, and I was left 

begging him to please take 
something seriously. 

Actully, the entire cast gave 
a magnificent performance 
that the film’s plot does not 
do justice to. Bettany plays 
Frank 
with 
a restrained 
ferocity that 
conveys 
a 
million 
thoughts 
with the flick 
of a cigarette. 
And 
his 
wide-eyed 
niece 
Beth 
(Sophia 
Lillis, 
“It”) 
is a breath of 
fresh air on 
this road trip 
to 
rebirth. 
But, without 
giving too much away, this 
film asks us to believe things 
that are pretty hard to accept, 
all in the name of tying up the 
story in a pretty, feel-good 
bow.
Still, I have no doubt that 
“Uncle Frank” will be a box 
office hit. Its biggest flaw 
is also its biggest draw to 
the public — it’s a movie you 
feel like you’ve seen before. 
Though there are some twists 
and shocking scenes, you can 
count down the minutes to 
exactly when you’re supposed 
to cry next, and be assured 
that a laugh is just around the 
corner. 
“Uncle Frank” has a lot 
to say, I just wish it had the 
courage to say it. Though they 
explode in the occasional 
outburst, the real, crushing 
emotions of “Uncle Frank” 
are kept at bay, with nearly 
every disagreement ending 
with a “hey you know what? 
It’s okay.” In the world of 
“Uncle Frank”’, disapproval 
consists of whispers around 
the corner and fights that are 
resolved with a mere hug. It 
would be quite a nice world to 
live in, but it isn’t the truth.

‘Uncle Frank’ 
fails to take even 
itself seriously

SUNDANCE SPECIAL EDITION

We all know technology is 
going to be the end of us. We live 
in an age in which we all ignore 
the fact that TikTok is a vehicle 
for the Chinese government to 
collect our information, while 
covering 
a 
laptop’s 
camera 
with a band-aid is becoming an 
increasingly popular practice. 
But does any of this paranoia 
mean that we’re going to stop 
using our technology altogether? 
Will the flip phone make a 
comeback in 2020? Doubtful. And 
even as it becomes increasingly 
clear that technology is an 
integral 
part 
of 
our 
lives 
whether we like it or not, Olivia 
Wilde’s (“Booksmart”) newest 
short, “Wake Up,” follows an 
unnamed woman in a world 
“where people are more engaged 
with screens and devices than 
with each other,” according to 
a 
press 
email 
from 
Wilde’s 
publicist. 
Despite 
its 
visual 
appeal, 
“Wake Up” does 
nothing for the 
conversation 
it 
attempts 
to 
create. 
The 
short 
film, 
as 
posited by the 
filmmakers 
at 
the 
premiere, 
is 
meant 
to 
encourage 
a 
balance between 
humans 
and 
technology that is supposedly 
missing from this day and age. In 
this regard, the Sundance event 
was 
supposedly 
“phone-free” 
and, hypothetically, everyone 
would have their phones in a 
locked case that would only be 
opened when leaving the event. 
But despite the coordinators’ 
best efforts, phones were still out 
and documenting the premiere 
of a film meant to discourage 
that exact behavior. 
The 10 and a half minute film 
failed to realize its audience and 
reach — the general public won’t 
see “Wake Up” at the Sundance 
Film 
Festival, 
with 
Olivia 
Wilde there to explain what it’s 
supposed to be telling you. No, 
the short is going to be consumed 
on Twitter, passed around by the 
very thing it claims to denounce, 
with the sole message that we’re 
going to end up bleeding on the 
ground if we don’t “wake up.” 
Without the introduction by the 
director or the ruminations of 
a panel following the film, this 
nuance is lost. It isn’t a spoiler 
for me to tell you that Margaret 
Qualley’s (“Once Upon a Time 
in Hollywood”) character ends 
up in the hospital for her 
phone addiction because that’s 

how every single story about 
“disconnecting” goes. And this 
might hit hard for a minute, 

but then whoever is scrolling is 
going to keep scrolling with only 
a vague feeling 
that maybe they 
should 
get 
off 
their phone. 
As an avid fan 
of “Booksmart,” I 
was disappointed 
to 
see 
such 
a 
contrite 
idea 
come 
from 
Wilde. There was 
nothing new to 
this concept — we 
all know we spend 
too 
much 
time 
on our phones, 
but if you’re not 
willing 
to 
toss 
out the iPhone for a Motorola 
Razor or get rid of your phone 
altogether, 
the 
conversation 
“Wake Up” tries to spark is all 
but over. Eventually, though, 
it became clear in the post-
film fireside chat that this idea 
didn’t come from Wilde herself. 
Instead, the concept itself came 
from HP, a fact that restored 
my faith in Wilde’s ability as a 
director. 
And so, none of this is to say 
that Wilde and Qualley didn’t 
do a good job with what they 
had — it’s just that what they 
had was a cliché, irrelevant 
corporate message from HP. The 
fireside chat further revealed 
the questionable nature of this 
short film. It could be argued 
that HP is doing a good thing in 
supporting the arts, in trying to 
“start” a conversation around 
our technology use. But when 
the director of the film asks 
us to consider who exactly is 
controlling 
what 
technology 
we use, after producing a film 
commissioned by those same 
people, the irony is clear. Those 
in power don’t even know they 
hold the power or, if they do, 
they’re desperately trying to 
convince us otherwise.

The description of Eliza 
Hittman’s 
follow-up 
to 
2017’s 
“Beach 
Rats” 
is 
fairly simple: A teenage girl 
from 
rural 
Pennsylvania 
travels to New York City to 
get an abortion. The film 
mirrors 
its 
descriptor’s 
straightforwardness — there 
is little dialogue, and nearly 
all of the scenes take place 
in a fluorescent-lit doctor’s 
office, 
on 
sickly 
public 
transportation or the rainy 
streets of New York City. 
But in its simplicity is where 
the film is most captivating, 
seizing the emotion of the 
occasion so perfectly you feel 
the protagonist’s desperation 
in 
every 
footstep. 
Autumn 
(Sidney 
Flanigan) 
is 
a 
reserved, 
unassuming 
17-year-old 
girl 
who 
we first see 
performing 
a 
folksy 
rendition 
of 
The Exciters 
“He’s Got The 
Power” with 
silver glitter 
painted 
heavily onto her sad eyelids. 
In the midst of lyrics like “He 
makes me do things I don’t 
want to do, he makes me say 
things I don’t want to say,” 
Autumn is interrupted by a 

boy yelling “slut!” Though 
she falters for a second, 
she continues, showing us 
more about our protagonist 

than if she had said a single 
word. After a post-concert 
dinner with her supportive 
mother and sister and not-
so-supportive father, Autumn 
runs home, and the camera 
pans down to the growing 
bump on her abdomen. 
When it becomes clear that 
the parental consent laws 
of rural Pennsylvania won’t 
allow for Autumn to get an 
abortion, she and her cousin/
best 
friend 
Skylar 
(Talia 
Ryder) pocket some money 
from their pervy grocery-
store boss and head to New 
York City. It quickly becomes 
apparent 
that 
even 
in 
a 
pro-choice city, getting an 
abortion is incredibly difficult 
and expensive, and the girls 
are left in NYC with no money 
for food or shelter, with men 
preying 
on 
them 
around 
every corner.
In 
a 
year 
when abortion 
rights 
are 
under attack, 
“Never 
Rarely” 
captures 
the 
crushing 
isolation 
and 
trauma 
of 
the 
process 
poignantly. 
Though it is 
technically an 
“issue” film, it 
doesn’t feel like a PSA, though 
you may feel obliged to donate 
to Planned Parenthood after 
watching it. 
The most remarkable scene 
involves the titular phrase 
being used in Autumn’s pre-
procedure 
interview. 
The 
counselor asks a series of 
questions 
about 
Autumn’s 
relationships 
and 
sexual 
history, requesting that she 
answer either never, rarely, 
sometimes, always. Though 
Autumn obliges at first, the 
biggest 
revelations 
come 
from the questions she leaves 
unanswered, 
demonstrating 
a brilliance in filmmaking 
where the most important 
moments are disclosed in 
silence. 
Between 
the 
beautifully 
comfortable 
relationship 
between Autumn and Skylar 
and the suppressed agony that 
both girls are experiencing, 
“Never Rarely” is a film that 
makes a powerful call to 
action with very few words 
at all. It is overwhelming 
and ravishing, leaning on the 
talents of two young breakout 
stars to tell a story that is 
yearning to be heard.

HP’s ‘Wake Up’ 
is one giant yawn
‘Never Rarely’ is 
a moving look at 
teen pregnancy 

I’ve been thinking about dating a lot recently. In theory, the point 
of dating is to find the person with whom you’re eventually going 
to spend the rest of your life. In practice, though, dating seems, 
especially in college, more about conquests and gaining experience 
than finding a lifelong partner. This isn’t an issue, but it does make 
me wonder how our relationships change as we get older. “Shirley” 
takes this question and creates a thrilling film in which two couples 
spiral into each other, pushing themselves in and out of reality. 
“Shirley” is rooted in comparisons that strategically reveal the 
flaws of the two relationships. The young Fred (Logan Lerman, 
“Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief”) and Rose (Odessa Young, 
“The Professor”) are bright-eyed newlyweds who have yet to 
experience the emotional rollercoaster of a long-term relationship. 
Rose has a naïve, blind trust in Fred, the kind of trust we all want to 
have in a relationship and the trust that’s missing in Stanley (Michael 
Stuhlbarg, “Call Me By Your Name”) and Shirley’s (Elisabeth Moss, 
“The Kitchen”) relationship. It’s this initial difference in timeline 
that sets the two couples up for the dramatic flair of the film — when 
Fred and Rose move in with Stanley and Shirley, the established 
habits of the older couple have a strong influence on the budding 
marriage and we watch as Fred and Rose slowly fall out of sync, only 
to see Rose grow closer and closer to Shirley. 
And as Rose and Shirley’s relationship develops, it becomes clear 
that neither of their husbands are capable of bringing out the best 
in either character. Shirley is tethered to a cheating and sexist 
professor, a man who can’t stand the fact that his wife is smarter 
than him. Rose, on the other hand, has yet to find her voice. She is 
mousey and barely even secure in her role as Fred’s wife. Neither 
woman fully reaches their potential until they meet the other. As 
“Shirley” unfolds we watch Rose grow into a powerful woman, and 
eventually mother, and leave behind her insecurities as a “little 
wifey.” The film creates an atmosphere ripe with feminism without 

ever raising a picket sign. 
To watch these couples dance around each other is like seeing 
two very strange courtships — Fred and Stanley perform with 
the awkward gaits of two males unwilling to bow to the other. 
In contrast, Shirley and Rose create a symbiotic relationship — 
Shirley’s eccentricity brings Rose’s confidence to the surface while 
Rose’s burgeoning self-discovery motivates Shirley to return to her 
work; neither of which would have ever been accomplished in their 
relationship with their respective husbands. 
“Shirley” is a strange film. Jump cuts and shaky camera work 
often made it hard to follow, but the film creates rich, emotionally 
driven scenes that explore the parallels of relationships in a way 
that is often muddled in other pieces. As “Shirley” comes to a close, 
it’s obvious that what we watched was 
not just two couples living together, 
but the origin story of how Stanley 
and Shirley’s relationship came to 
be. These are no longer coincidental 
parallels in their relationship, but 
intentional patterns that occur in 
committed partnerships. 
This film answered one of my 
burning life questions: what is it like 
to be married to Logan Lerman, our 
resident white boy of the decade? 
Disappointing, to say the least. But 
after “Shirley” I realized we’ve been 
dreaming about the wrong person; 
Elisabeth Moss takes the life of a 
suburban wife, working from home, 
and makes it an adventure. A scary 
one, but an adventure nonetheless. 
It’s this reevaluation of our long-
held expectations, both about Logan 
Lerman and marriage, that make 
“Shirley” such an impactful film.

SUNDANCE SPECIAL EDITION
‘Herself’ is a painful, needed look at domestic violence

‘Luxor’ on age, 
nostalgia, love

EMMA CHANG
Daily Arts Writer

EMMA CHANG
Daily Arts Writer

Our twenties are supposed 
to be one of the most formative 
decades of our lives — many 
of us go to college, graduate 
from said college and move 
on to insanely different lives 
all in the first five years of 
this decade. Throw in a study-
abroad stint or two and there’s 
the potential to become a 
wholly new person from when 
we’re 20 to when we hit the 
big three-oh. We come up with 
tangible hopes and dreams in 
our twenties, all of us on the 
cusp of this big “something” 
that they talk about in books. 
But what happens when they 
don’t come to fruition? We 
learn to let go, but sometimes 
what we can’t have when we’re 
twenty comes back years later, 
taunting us with what could 
have been, making us wonder 
what we could still have. 
Director Zeina Durra’s (“The 
Imperialists are Still Alive”) 
“Luxor” takes this feeling 
and, instead of developing 
strong characters with a rich 
background, 
imbues 
this 
nostalgia 
with 
the 
monotonous 
atmosphere of 
reality. 
Named 
for 
its 
setting, 
“Luxor” 
follows 
Hana 
(Andrea 
Riseborough, 
“Mandy”) 
as 
she 
tries 
to 
rediscover 
herself in the 
city 
where 
she 
found 
love 
in 
her 
20s. But if it wasn’t for 
the 
film’s 
description 
on 
Sundance’s 
website, 
this 
important connection to the 
city would have remained a 
mystery. Aside from vague 
references to a previous visit, 
there is little mention of her 
relationship with Luxor and 
its importance to her youth. 
“Luxor” also introduces its 
audience to Sultan (Karim 
Saleh, “Counterpart”), Hana’s 
former lover, another fact 
only obvious because of the 
film’s summary. The film 
desperately tries to establish 
a rapport between the two 
characters, but it lacks the 
heat of two lost loves finally 
reunited; instead, Hana and 
Sultan exude an air of friends 
who lost touch for a bit. 
Hana’s 
character 
leaves 
much to be desired — Durra 
chooses 
to 
depict 
the 
dregs of a woman who was 
once probably bubbly and 
charismatic, which isn’t a 
problem in itself. The issue, 
once more, is that there is little 
effort to create any feeling 
of sympathy towards her. In 
place of actually exploring her 
experiences, and the question 
of what it’s like to be at war, 
“Luxor” barely acknowledged 
the trauma that Hana was 
supposedly 
escaping, 
only 
addressing it in an offhand 
comment about her inability 
to sleep. 

As it tries to consider the 
themes of love and war, the 
film also tries to foster a sense 
of nostalgia. And it does … in 
a really, really subtle way. 
Hana’s 
stumbling 
manners 
with Sultan and recognition 
of community members hint 
at days gone by, but nothing 
so strong that the audience is 
made to sympathize with her. 
Rather, it seems as if Luxor is 
just a friendly city. 
“Luxor” also seems to wish 
to explore more than lost 
love — the added element of 
spirituality creates an air of 
mystery that is left unsolved. 
It is never fully explained why 
exactly Hana can’t remember 
seemingly 
unforgettable 
trips; the audience is simply 
left to believe that it has 
something to do with her 
time at a war border. Loose 
ends might create intrigue 
within a film. But when 
they’re coupled with an effort 
to establish a conversation 
around 
spirituality 
with 
little exploration of why this 
spirituality is important to 
both the audience and the 
characters, it seems less like 
those 
questions 
were strategically 
unanswered and 
more 
like 
the 
writers 
forgot 
to 
finish 
their 
thoughts. 

And it’s not as if 
this emotionless 
atmosphere 
is 
then 
replaced 
with desire for 
Sultan or a time 
before. 
Instead, 
the film is a slow 
uncovering of the 
shells that trauma 
creates and how 
our 
interactions 
are left just as empty as we are. 
No longer are Sultan and Hana 
the lively 20-year-olds who 
met at the edge of life. Both 
have gone and seen the world 
and it seems they may never 
get together like they once did. 
This theme, however, is left 
just as unexplored as Hana’s 
spiritual 
journey. 
Though 
there is little of the “will they, 
won’t they” nature of a sitcom, 
there is also no conflict 
in the rekindling of their 
relationship. 
Small 
tidbits 
from their past come up, a 
woman named Chloe seemed 
to be of particular issue, but 
beyond that, all “Luxor” really 
presents is two 40-ish people 
trying to find who they were 
twenty years prior. 
Despite the lack of depth, 
or 
maybe 
because 
of 
it, 
“Luxor” maintained a sense 
of realism. In our everyday 
lives, 
there 
aren’t 
always 
“aha” moments. We move day-
to-day, sometimes shuffling 
through life like Hana, only to 
stumble on a person from our 
past pushing us to reevaluate 
the tedious nature of our lives. 
Is it supposed to be boring 
once we leave our twenties? 
Do we just follow a career 
path blindly into a war zone? 
“Luxor” suggests that, yes, 
we do, but the film provides 
a little bit of hope that maybe 
we’ll get a shot at our twenties 
again.

“Black widow.”
This is what Sandra (Clare Dunne, “Cynthia”) whispers to her eldest 
daughter Emma (Ruby Rose O’Hara, “The Secret Market”) right before 
Sandra’s husband Gary (Ian Lloyd Anderson, “Love/Hate”) throws her 
to the ground and beats her until her face is bloodied and her wrist is 
shattered. In between shots of Gary’s vicious aggression, Emma is shown 
running to a nearby store with an ornate container. Inside is a note which 
reads, “Call 999, my life is in danger.” 
Directed by Phyllida Lloyd (“Mamma Mia!”), “Herself” is a story 
co-written by Dunne and framed in the context of Dublin’s domestic abuse 
and housing crises. The film follows Sandra as she transforms from a wife 
and mother of 10 years to a woman living in a hotel room with her children 
to avoid her abuser. Though free from sharing the same space as Gary, 
Sandra grapples with suffocating anxiety as she relives her abuse and has 
to drop her daughters off every weekend at the home where it occurred. To 
finally feel emancipated, Sandra decides that she is going to build a house 
for her and her daughters and, as a result, reclaim her life.
Though “Herself” incorporates a magnitude of social issues — family 

court, housing availability, domestic abuse and anxiety, just to name a few 
— it does so in a way that is more empathetic and harmonious than it is 
preachy or disjointed. Dunne, in one of her first major roles, is captivating 
as her self-written character. She is able to flawlessly swing between joy 
and pain, desperation and hope, telling the story of trauma hidden behind a 
mother trying to do what’s best for her kids. Dunne’s defining performance 
is bolstered by supporting actress Harriet Walter (“Succession”). Walter 
plays Peggy, an old doctor that Sandra’s late mother used to work for, who 
offers up her large backyard to be the site of Sandra’s DIY home. Peggy is 
sharp-witted and tough, but never fails to be a comforting presence when 
Sandra breaks down. 
At some points, the plot does seem relatively predictable. Secretly 
building a house to escape your abusive partner is no easy feat, as we come 
to see. But the occasional foreseeable moments of the movie did not take 
away from the trance it put me in, and any feeling that one knows what’s 
coming next is blown apart when the final “black widow” of the film is 
uttered. Needless to say, the ending is not a happy one — it reaches inside 
you and freezes your heart, as you pray you’re not seeing what you think 
you are. But even if it is not happy, it is hopeful, and no one will leave the 
movie feeling completely devastated. 

If there is anything to complain about — and really, there is very little — 

it is the auditory elements of the film. Some song choices are truly bizarre, 
and the uneven sound mixing made Sia’s “Titanium” blasting through my 
skull all the more unpleasant. And though it seems legally required that any 
Irish piece of media use “Dreams” by The Cranberries, the hazy song was 
forced awkwardly in, cut off right when you needed it to get good. 
Poor music choice aside, “Herself” is a film that follows you well after 
you leave the theater. It is painful, yet necessary. It is an exceptional film 
that gracefully touches upon devastating and sensitive topics through a 
remarkable actress who is bound for continued greatness.

Youth in ‘The 40-Year-Old-Version’

Age and mortality are concepts we all struggle 
with. There is not a day when I don’t have an 
existential crisis about the futility of my future 
because of the impending threat of climate 
change. But the iron willpower that helps me 
survive the incessant pressures of completing 
medical school applications and maintaining my 
sanity ebbed away during the glorious two hours 
of Radha Blank’s “The 40-Year-Old-Version.”
The film places Blank in a future where the 
worst could have happened: nothing. Blank’s 
self-named title character was once an up-and-
coming playwright, but ten years have passed 
and, as she approaches 40, she has little to show 
for it, except an award from her early thirties 
and a classroom full of teenagers that may or 
may not hate her. 
The film opens like most coming-of-age 
stories — Blank is shown getting ready for her 
day, late for work, establishing the fact that 
her life has stalled. And while these opening 

scenes are common tropes in such films, the 
comedic tone that they set for the rest of the 
film is anything but generic. From jokes about 
“white men with Black lady butts” to awkward 
moments of silence following an explanation of 
why soy milk is an important theme in her play, 
“The 40-Year-Old-Version” proves that not only 
is it a fantastic drama, but that its director has 
a deep understanding of comedic timing. In no 
other movie would I expect a joke about almost 
underage kids making advances on a 40-year-
old woman to be funny. 
On the surface, “The 40-Year-Old-Version” 
is like most stories that try and reconcile our 
obsession with youth with the inevitable aging 
process. Blank creates a down-on-her-luck 
character who, when she finally decides to go 
out on a limb and try something new, eventually 
finds herself in a wreckage of her previous life. 
While this is an incredibly predictable trope, 
the film’s details transforms it into something 
deeply personal. And it’s this balance between 
individuality and universal themes that makes 
“The 
40-Year-Old-Version” 
special. 
Blank 
connects with her audience and gets them 

invested in her story but keeps them in their 
seats with offering a new perspective on the 
world. 
“The 40-Year-Old-Version” explores a variety 
of themes, but one that it addresses particularly 
well is how we’re perceived in the world, 
especially as we age. The film consistently breaks 
away from its professionally shot atmosphere 
to what seem like iPhone videos of people that 
exist in Blank’s world — an Asian bodega owner 
around the corner, a Spanish salesclerk and a 
hilariously sassy older Black woman. These 
three characters serve as sounding boards for 
Blank’s experiences; we hear their thoughts 
about turning forty and their reactions to her 
decision to rap. All three provide interesting 
perspectives that help Blank explore what it 
means to do something for yourself even as the 
people in your life, whose opinions shouldn’t 
really matter but that we care about anyways, 
seem to scoff at your choices.

Franz Wagner does what Michigan needs most

If 
Franz 
Wagner 
proved 
one thing in the first half of the 
Wolverines’ Big Ten slate, it’s that he 
doesn’t shy away from big moments.
For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team, Tuesday’s game 
against Nebraska was one of those 
moments. With senior point guard 
Zavier 
Simpson 
(suspension) 
and junior forward Isaiah Livers 
(injury) unavailable, the Wolverines 
were without two main sources of 
offense as they limped into Lincoln 
with a 0-5 road record.
Riding the program’s longest 
losing streak in five years, it 
appeared the perfect storm was 
brewing — one that would bring a 
loss with the potential to impact 
Selection Sunday in all the wrong 
ways.
Instead, Michigan overcame the 
absences and road environment, 
ending its drought with a 79-68 win.
While junior guard Eli Brooks 
scored a game-high 20 points, it was 
Wagner’s aggressiveness that stood 
out most. The freshman wing took 
a team-high 15 shots in 25 minutes, 
scored 18 points, tied his season-
high with eight rebounds and added 
three steals.
What’s more important, though, 
is how he reached that statline. 
Before Tuesday, more than half of 
Wagner’s shots against conference 
opponents came from beyond 
the arc. Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard is relentless in encouraging 
his players to let it go when they’re 
open, but there also seemed to 
be times when the 6-foot-9, long-
armed Wagner could be taking 
advantage of matchups in other 
ways.
Against the Cornhuskers, he was 
more than a spot-up shooter. And 
when the Wolverines needed him 
to do it all, that’s exactly what he 
did. The Daily took a closer look:
While Wagner’s height and 
length give him a physical upper-
hand in most one-on-one matchups, 
they’re perhaps most valuable on 
the open floor. Against a Nebraska 
team that posed few intimidating 

size 
matchups, 
Wagner 
took 
advantage.
His long arms allow him to 
disrupt a scoring opportunity and 
turn it into one of his own. His ball-
handling made the difference after 
the initial steal, particularly the left-
handed push dribble and behind-
the-back move. Because both moves 
came in stride, he got to the rim and 
finished through contact with his 
off hand. Few players on the court 
can do all that in one fell swoop.
By now, Wagner has made a 
name for himself within the Big 
Ten as a 3-point shooter. But when 
Michigan needed him to make 
a difference in the interior on 
Tuesday, he delivered.
Offensively, 
the 
team 
used 
his size to solve Nebraska’s zone 
defense. By keeping senior center 
Jon Teske on the block, the 
Wolverines made the Cornhuskers 
commit at least one defender to the 
post. That opened space for Wagner 
to remain at the free throw line, 
waiting for a chance to slip into a 
gap as the zone shifted in response 
to perimeter passes.
With six minutes left in the 
second half, Brooks’ pump fake 
toward the post creates one of those 
gaps. Wagner, then, needs only one 
dribble to get to the rim and finish 
strong.

Wagner 
made 
his 
interior 
presence felt on defense, too. 
Knowing Teske would hedge hard 
on ball screens, he adjusted his off-
ball defensive position accordingly.
By shifting into the paint, 
Wagner was able to help on 
Teske’s assignment in case the 
hedger couldn’t recover in time. 
His defensive IQ kicked in, as 
he straddled the line between 
committing to Teske’s assignment 
and remaining close enough to 
his own man to defend any cross-
court skip pass.
Sure enough, Teske couldn’t 
recover in time, giving Nebraska 
a chance to take advantage. But 
when Kevin Cross left his feet for 
what he thought would be an open 
layup, Wagner was there to protect 
the rim.
Above 
all 
else, 
Wagner’s 
versatility defined his effectiveness 
on Tuesday. Because of his ability 
to score at all three levels, Howard 
can play him alongside a true 
center like senior Austin Davis 
and sophomore forward Brandon 
Johns Jr., who often works out of 
the post.
With each of them on the floor, 
Wagner’s scoring chances come in 
bunches when defenses collapse. 
With 13 minutes left in the game, 
he was left wide open on the 

perimeter when Johns’ post touch 
draws four Cornhuskers into the 
paint.
Wagner makes his way to the 
top of the key once he notices the 
defensive collapse, which creates 
an easier passing angle for Johns’ 
kickout. Nobody is within eight 
feet of Wagner when he catches it, 
and he promptly buries the three.
With Livers on the shelf for 
the foreseeable future, Wagner’s 
evolving offensive game could help 
pull Michigan out of the Big Ten’s 
bottom half. To do that, though, 
the Wolverines need the multi-
dimensional version of Wagner 
— not the spot-up shooter who’s 
made just five of his last 26 3-point 
attempts.
“Franz is a high-IQ basketball 
player,” 
Howard 
said. 
“He 
knows that we need his offensive 
leadership. He knows that we need 
his offensive talent. And today, he 
did a really good job of mixing in 
both by attacking the basket and 
making outside shots.”
On Tuesday, Wagner showed 
what his offensive game looks 
like when the puzzle pieces are 
put together. If those pieces can 
remain intact once Simpson and 
Livers return, Michigan’s offense 
could very well peak at the right 
time.

‘M’ freshmen looking 
to replace senior class

The Michigan softball team is 
aware it has big shoes to fill. 
Five seniors from last year’s 
team — each one a key cog in 
the lineup and a vital presence 
in the locker room — are gone. A 
class that coach Carol Hutchins 
often endorses as one of the best 
she’s ever had graduated in May, 
leaving behind sizeable holes. 
There’s no blueprint when it 
comes to potential replacements. 
Second baseman Faith Canfield 
was All-Big Ten first team with 
a .404 batting average, while 
outfielder Natalie Peters and 
first baseman Alex Sobczak 
were members of the All-Big 
Ten second team. Sobczak and 
catcher Katie Alexander shared 
the team lead with 10 home runs, 
and infielder Mackenzie Nemitz 
drove in 31 runs while drawing 
35 starts as the designated player. 
Still, it’s apparent that the 
current 
Wolverines 
firmly 
believe in the group of players 
they 
have. 
At 
Tuesday’s 
Media 
Day, 
players 
spoke 
with 
unwavering 
confidence, 
seemingly unfazed by the roster 
turnover. 
“Obviously, we had some 
great, great girls that graduated,” 
sophomore pitcher Alex Storako 
said. “But I think being a part 
of 
Michigan 
softball, 
we’re 
always going to have key players 
stepping in. It’s just a matter of 
getting that chance, and a lot of 
girls are ready to finally get that 
chance. We’re all very talented, 
and I’m very excited to see that 
all of the pieces finally fit into the 
puzzle.”
The first piece of the puzzle 
is putting together a batting 
order, 
and 
with 
just 
four 
starters returning, there are an 
abundance of open spots. 
“We’re 
going 
to 
try 
to 
find the best nine that play 
together,” Hutchins said. “But 

it’s competitive. And I like that 
because the competitors are the 
ones that will win the positions. 
Competition makes you better.”
As to which players will claim 
the contested starting roles, 
Hutchins maintained nothing 
is set in stone, conceding that 
a consistent lineup cannot be 
ironed out until everyone is 
given ample opportunities in 
real game play. She noted junior 
infielder Taylor Bump, senior 
outfielder 
Thais 
Gonzalez, 
sophomore 
infielder 
Morgan 
Overaitis and freshman infielder 
Julia Jimenez as several players 
who have impressed thus far.
“Players that need to step up 
in their positions have stepped 
up,” 
senior 
third 
baseman 
Madison Uden said. “Maybe 
there was a bit of pressure in the 
fall, but now it feels good. Where 
we need to fill gaps, we’re filling 
those gaps.”
Stepping up in terms of 
providing offensive production 
is, then again, only half the task. 
The leadership voids left by the 
seniors are also substantial. 
Uden is the only returning 
captain, 
with 
fellow 
2019 
captains Canfield and Alexander 
having graduated.
In response, Hutchins has 
implemented a new leadership 
scheme, 
deviating 
from 
the 
traditional 
route 
of 
naming 
captains in favor of a more 
community-oriented alternative.
Throughout the offseason, 
the team worked with a Navy 
SEAL 
program. 
Upon 
the 
program’s completion, SEALs 
identified the strongest leaders. 
The group — Bump, Gonzalez, 
Uden 
and 
junior 
shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez — operate 
under the title of the “leadership 
council” and meet regularly with 
Hutchins for debriefing sessions. 

EVANSTON 
— 
Welsh-
Ryan Arena exploded, again. 
The Wolverines’ work on the 
offensive end quickly forgotten, 
the Wildcats answered in a 
resounding, soul sucking move.
It was a torturous pattern 
in 
Thursday 
night’s 
81-73 
loss to No. 23 Northwestern 
(18-3 overall, 8-2 Big Ten) 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team (13-7, 4-5). 
The Wolverines continuously 
found themselves in a five-to-
six point hole, occasionally 
poking their heads up and 
snagging a lead, but every time 
they fought back the Wildcats 
hammered them back down. 
Early in the first quarter, 
though, the match seemed 
on its way for a repeat of 
Michigan’s last match against 
a ranked opponent. 
Michigan’s 
starting 
lineup could barely handle 
defending senior Abbie Wolf. 
Northwestern’s 
switches 
off the ball left sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk, and at times 
sophomore 
guard 
Danielle 
Rauch, on the much larger 
center. There were easy shots 
for her, until Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico made a quick 
switch by putting her own 
center in — freshman Izabel 
Varejão.
Her introduction stopped 
the bleeding on the inside, 
while also offering an offensive 
spark. She gave the Wolverines 
its first true sign of offense 
in the first quarter, scoring a 
quick four points and gathering 
another assist.
“Our best is when we’re 
playing zone with our hands 
up,” Dilk said. “(Varejão), she’s 
the biggest one on the court 
with her wingspan and I think 
tonight she finally realized ‘if 
I play with my hands up I’m 
gonna get tips,’ and she did 
a great job of that. Our two 
guards up top were doing a 
great job of that. It was making 
them change the angles of 

passes which slowed them 
down just a half second.”
Unfortunately, she could do 
nothing to help the emergence 
of 
the 
Wildcats’ 
outside 
shooters. Senior Abi Scheid 
drained two threes, and after 
the 
second 
Barnes 
Arico 
was livid — the shooter was 
Varejão’s to close out on, but 
she didn’t.
At the end of the first 
quarter, it looked like the game 
would go down as another 
culmination of turnovers and 
poor defending of the 3-point 
line for Michigan. It committed 
eight turnovers in the first 
quarter, Northwestern shot 60 
percent from three.
A fiery Barnes Arico leaned 
into her players in between 
quarters, 
but 
the 
results 
were elusive for the first five 
minutes of the second quarter. 
“We were just definitely 
trying to pick each other 
up,” sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon said. “And talking 
about how we still have the 
opportunity to get out there 
and hustle, and play really hard 
and we all need to focus in and 
make sure that we’re playing 
hard from start to finish.”
Added Barnes Arico: “We 
need to regroup, we had just 
talked about it in the locker 
room, we just need to regroup 
and we just need to settle in 
and we gotta chip away. And I 
thought we did, I thought our 
focus after that first quarter 
was really good and we were 
able to regroup and make it a 
game down the stretch.”
And then, down 30-21 with 
five minutes to go in the half, 
Varejão came back in.
The 
offense 
opened 
up, 
and the defense locked down. 
A 14-6 run ensued, giving 
Michigan its first lead of the 
game with 1:04 left in the half 
after freshman guard Michelle 
Sidor stole the ball and Varejão 
drained a layup.
“I thought our post really 
could take advantage of them 
and that’s why we went with 
that big lineup of (Varejão), 

(senior forward) Hailey Brown 
and Naz Hillmon,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I thought that 
really helped take advantage 
of the inside and I thought 
(Hillmon) did a really great job 
inside as well.”
After forcing a bad buzzer-

beater shot from Northwestern 
to end the half, the bench — 
and Barnes Arico — erupted, 
ending the quarter on a much 
different note than the last one.
Neck and neck for most of 
the third quarter, Michigan let 
the Wildcats pull away for a 
quick six-point lead at the end 
of the quarter. They wouldn’t 
look back, and the distance was 
stretched in the fourth quarter.
Wolf couldn’t be defended 
and neither could junior guard 
Lindsey Pulliam, who pulled up 
for jumpers from every corner 
of the court. She muscled Sidor 
under the basket, made corner 
threes and drained fadeaways 
all over.
Unlike the first quarter, 
it 
wasn’t 
the 
Wolverines’ 
mistakes 
that 
gave 
Northwestern the lead. It was 
two unstoppable players.

EVANSTON — Down nine 
midway through the second 
quarter, and with sloppy play 
preventing any sort of rhythm, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team needed a spark.
Amy Dilk had been at the 
forefront of the Wolverines’ ugly 
first quarter. After turning the 
ball over twice in the first two 
minutes of the game, it looked 
like it might be a lost night for 
the sophomore guard. But rather 
than letting her work out the 
kinks on the court, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico took 
her out four minutes into the 
game and talked to her. And the 
message resonated.
“She knows I can put more 
effort than what I’m putting in,” 
Dilk said. “I need to be more 
dialed in from the start and that’s 
obviously on me. Basically I just 
need to play harder.”
With 6:21 left in the second 
quarter, Dilk saw her chance to be 
that spark. She poked the ball out 
of Northwestern guard Lindsey 
Pulliam’s hands at the 3-point 

line, and as it was rolling out of 
bounds, Dilk dove to the floor to 
save it. The Wolverines called a 
timeout to keep possession, and 
despite the nine-point deficit, 
they were fired up.
“I think I owed it to my team 
to get some hustle plays, and I 
think I got some tonight,” Dilk 
said. “Obviously, when any of our 
teammates dive on the floor, it 
brings the momentum and energy 
up on the bench, on the court. 
So, just being able to do that and 
bringing the momentum up was 
huge for us.”
While 
Michigan’s 
play 
improved out of the timeout, 
it couldn’t overcome its first-
quarter struggles, leading to an 
81-73 loss.
But Dilk wouldn’t let the 
Wolverines go down so easily. 
At the top of a 2-3 zone, she 
continued to give the Wildcats 
trouble, deflecting passes and 
forcing Northwestern to reset its 
offense and settle for tough shots. 
She logged three steals in the 
quarter.
Offensively, she settled down. 
While the Wildcats continued 
to press, Dilk didn’t try to force 

passes 
upcourt 
to 
avoid 
it. 
Instead, she trusted her ability 
as a ball handler and only passed 
the ball when she was stifled by 
Northwestern defenders.
As Dilk’s play improved, so 
did Michigan’s. But in the end, it 
wasn’t enough. After her steal, the 
Wolverines grabbed a one-point 
lead with a 16-6 run — during 
which Dilk scored four points and 
assisted on the go-ahead basket 
— but they couldn’t extend it any 
further, leaving the door open for 
the Wildcats.
“I thought that she just started 
to … really take care of the ball a 
lot better and handle pressure 
a lot better,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She also moved extremely well 
without the ball and was making 
some cuts and … making herself 
available and finish plays around 
the rim.”
In the third quarter, Dilk 
showed no signs of slowing down. 
She continued to give the Wildcats 
problems 
defensively, 
and 
offensively, she only improved. 
When Dilk is at her best, she 
is driving with confidence and 
going up strong, qualities on full 
display Thursday night. 
But the Wolverines struggled 
from the floor in the third — 
shooting just 4-of-14 and missing 
layups and open 3-pointers — and 
Northwestern got hot, shooting 
over 
50 
percent. 
Dilk 
gave 
Michigan much-needed baskets 
and kept them in the game, 
scoring eight of her 15 points in 
the third, and the Wolverines 
led with 2:36 left. Though, the 
Wildcats ended the quarter on a 
9-2 run, and there wasn’t much 
Dilk could do to keep the game 
from slipping away. 
“She’s such a great passer that 
as soon as you bring through two 
or three at her, she’s dropping 
it off to me, or dropping it off to 
(freshman center Izabel Varejão),” 
sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
said. “She’s very unselfish, but it 
does help us a lot when she’s able 
to get into the paint and get those 
buckets.”
Dilk got those buckets, but the 
rest of the Wolverines couldn’t

Sophomore forward Naz Hillmon scored 27 points but it wasn’t enough as Michigan fell to Northwestern, 81-73.


 It was supposed to be a routine favor, a short 
and simple task for Mel Pearson.
 The Andersons, his billet family, were 
preoccupied and asked Pearson, then 16, to 
pick up one of their daughters for them.
 Naturally, Pearson borrowed one of their 
cars. His parents had taken most things, cars 
included, when they moved back to Flin 
Flon, Manitoba two years prior.
 Despite his inexperience driving, he didn’t 
shy away from the opportunity to use the car, 
nor did the Andersons feel deterred from 
letting him use it. 
 It was the family’s car, and he was, by all 
means, family.
 Pearson hopped in the driver’s seat of the 
blue Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, glanced 
in the rearview mirror and started backing 
down the driveway, a straight path to the 
road. It was a simple exit. 
 But before he knew it, he came to a halting 
stop. As he started to turn, the car jerked with 
resistance. Maybe he heard the grating sound 
of metal first. Or maybe he felt the ever so 
slight recoil first. But he certainly didn’t see 
it coming at all — an oak tree. One he had 
passed thousands of times before. One that 
laid so idly to the side. And he misjudged it.
 “You’re trying to be careful,” Pearson joked. 
“But that tree just jumped out at me.”
 A big dent on the front passenger-side 
fender of the car was residual evidence of his 
slip-up.
 Forty-four years later, Pearson understands 
the safety of the driver is the main concern. 
Cars can be replaced. People can’t be. The 
Andersons shared that sentiment, too.
 But at the time, when Pearson rushed out 
of the car to survey the damage, insecurities 
that lingered from his last billet family 
resurfaced.
 After complications with that family 
arose, the Andersons had taken Pearson 
into their home in Edina, Minn. with open 
arms, ensuring he wouldn’t have to go back 
to Canada — leaving behind his friends, his 
hockey team and the education his mother 
pushed so hard for.
 Now, bark torn off their tree, car dented, 
Pearson couldn’t help but feel this was the 
end of the world. For the first time since 
moving in, he felt that he had really done 
something wrong. It was a sinking feeling, 
especially knowing what was at stake.
 “I didn’t know if I was gonna get kicked 
out of the house, kicked out of the country,” 
Pearson said. “No, I’m serious. It’s one of 
those things, you feel so bad.”
 Neither ended up happening.
 Families aren’t perfect. Mistakes are 
bound to happen, and part of being family 
is forgiveness. So the Andersons forgave 
Pearson. Even though he thought he was an 
outsider, they didn’t consider him one.
 “It’s the nicest compliment you can give 
anybody,” John Anderson, Pearson’s billet 
brother, said. “He’s one of our family.”
 Pearson lugged a suitcase and a hockey bag 
up to the porch leading to the Andersons’ 
traditional colonial house. As autumn leaves 
fell all around him, he cradled the bags 
around his arms and shoulders as he started 
to scale the stone stairs.
 He’d been up the walkway before, but in 
much different circumstances. Before, he 
was just a visiting friend, a close neighbor. 
Now, he was a full-time resident. John 
followed behind him, carrying the remainder 
of his stuff. The move-in would only take one 
trip. Pearson didn’t have much to bring.
 His back was turned away from the 
O’Brien’s house directly across the street — a 
place that Pearson once called home.
 A year prior, when Mel’s father, Melvin, 
got cut from the Minnesota Fighting Saints, 
the Pearsons decided it was time to go home 
to Flin Flon. But Mel’s mother, Ruby, was 
adamant on giving her son an opportunity 
to earn a college scholarship and get an 
education. She believed letting Mel stay 

in Edina was the best bet for that. So she 
turned to her good friends, the O’Briens, and 
arranged for him to stay with them.
 The O’Briens had children themselves, so 
they were used to the responsibility. But the 
age differences were the problem. Mel was in 
high school, and their children weren’t even 
teenagers yet. Late curfews, hosting rowdy 
teens, giving up their car when needed — 
these were things they didn’t have to worry 
about yet with their own children. They 
thought they knew what to expect, but they 
didn’t expect it to be so hard.
 The O’Briens kept in touch with Mel’s 
parents, but Mel saw the writing on the 
wall. When his parents reached out to him 
and told him the O’Briens couldn’t host him 
anymore, he had already felt the same way. 
So while he was in the process of packing, 
Mel’s parents began the search for other 
possibilities. As the window was closing, 
John, his friend and teammate, reached out 
to his parents and probed the possibility to 
billet him.
 “He was probably gonna have to go back to 
Canada because nobody was going to take 
him at that point in time,” John said. “And I 
said to my parents, ‘Well, why don’t we take 
him?’ ”
 With each step he took toward the 
Andersons, he added distance from the 
O’Briens, a place he liked but knew didn’t 
really fit him. 
 It was the small things. 
 When bands such as Blue Oyster Cult, 
Marshall Tucker and the Eagles came to 
town, all of Pearson’s high school buddies 
went. Sixteen was a reasonable age to go. 
But when Pearson appealed to the O’Briens, 
they pointedly said “no.” They just weren’t 
comfortable with stuff like that yet. And that 
discomfort only grew.
 The Andersons were asked and said yes 
with little hesitation. 
 Mel was happy with the new arrangement. 
The O’Briens were as well. The Andersons 
had similar activities and interests. It was for 
the best, they thought. 
 So Pearson, his life with the O’Briens 
behind him, walked into his new house.
 Upon seeing him, Pearson could only recall 
the Andersons saying one thing.
 “Oh yeah, here comes this kid.”
 ***
 Pearson dropped his things into his new 
bedroom upstairs — a couple suitcases, a full 
backpack and his hockey bag.
 He didn’t decorate it too much, there was 
no need. John, his new roommate, had his 
fair share of decorations. One of which was a 
Farrah Fawcett swimsuit poster that Pearson 
was in disbelief his parents let him hang. If it 
was Pearson, he’d have slapped on a hockey 
poster.
 But Pearson started unpacking. While he 
did so, he asked John questions, things on his 
mind about the rest of the family and how 
he fit in.
 How were things going to be? He asked 
about John’s mom, dad, the two sisters. He 
was nervous, and he wanted to know.
 After Pearson finished, he crept down the 
stairs and into the foyer, where he could see 
the entire house. The slate floor felt cold 
against his feet.
 It was awkward.
 This was the second time in under a year 
Pearson had to move in with strangers. Of 
course, he had met both families before, but 
outside of John, neither family knew him 
particularly well.
 “I think that was the biggest thing,” Pearson 
said. “I knew them, but I didn’t know them.”
 Getting to know a new set of parents, a new 
set of rules, a new lifestyle, it was all weird to 
Pearson. This time, though, he had one of his 
good friends with him.
 Pearson walked through the hallway and to 
the kitchen, where Margaret — John’s mom 
— had just finished making dinner.
 As Pearson took his place around the table 
with the other kids — the parents would eat 
after they finished — he started to recognize 

one of the dishes, tomato and split 
pea soup.
 Margaret, normally called Margie, 
didn’t know at the time, nor would 
she learn until years later, but split 
pea soup was one of Pearson’s least-
favorite meals. He hated it. But it was 
his first day, and he wasn’t about to be 
ungrateful.
 The jean jacket he had on was already 
rolled up from when he had moved his 
things, so he went straight to digging in. He 
ate as much of what was served to him as he 
could handle, and when Margie looked away, 
he rushed to pour the rest down the drain. 
When she looked back and saw the quickly 
emptied bowl, she mistook it for how much 
he loved the soup, and asked him, “Oh, how 
was the soup?”
 “I said, ‘Haha, Mrs. Anderson. That was the 
best split pea soup I’ve ever had.’ ” Pearson 
said. “How could you tell her it’s lousy, right?
 “So the joke was every Sunday for quite a 
while, she made split pea soup. Just because 
she thought I loved it so much, and she 
wanted to welcome me into the family.”
 It was different than what he had left 
behind at the O’Briens.
 “Easygoing, fun, loving, relaxed, that was 
her role. Caring, all those things,” Pearson 
said. “A good mother.”
 And even though Pearson had just met her 
as a family member and not as a guest, that’s 
what she was.
 “Like a second mother,” Pearson said. 
“Appreciate her taking somebody like me 
and treating me like one of her kids.”
 The Andersons wanted people to stop 
by, guests to stay, people to enjoy their 
time when they visited. It came from their 
upbringing, and they were just trying to carry 
it over to the next generation.
 That extended to Pearson.
 They would try their hardest to include 
him in whatever family activity they had 
going on. Family trips, he came along. Family 
traditions, he took part. Family holidays, he 
celebrated. When Christmas rolled around 
and the kids rushed out of bed and to the 
tree, he joined. 
 “He was considered part of the family, he 
got presents just like everybody else,” John 
said. “My parents were really good about not 
making him feel like an outsider.”
 But there was a lingering feeling that never 
went away — at least not immediately.
 Despite all their best efforts, there were 
times when Mel couldn’t help but feel like 
the odd one out. And it was never obvious. It 
was as simple as going through the kitchen 
late at night for a snack and hesitating to 
open the refrigerator.
 “It’s weird moving into a house and going 
into somebody else’s refrigerator,” Pearson 
said. “Doesn’t seem like it’s yours.”
 Nor did turning on the television. Or 
staying out late at night beyond curfew. Or 
being able to just say no. 
 “If they were going somewhere, ‘Oh, we’re 
going to (wherever). Let’s all go along,’ and 
you know you’d rather just stay home and 
relax or something,” Pearson said. “OK, but 
you’re just trying to accommodate them, and 
because you know they’re going out of their 
way to make room for you and whatnot in 
the house.”
 And for a long time, whatever they did, he 
would do. If they didn’t offer, he would “just 
stay to (himself) and not screw up.”
 But within a year, when the hospitality 
became the norm and the household became 
family, he grew more comfortable. After a 
year, he could help himself to the fridge.
 “ ‘Do I have to do my own wash?’ I didn’t 
feel like making Mrs. Anderson have to do 
my laundry,” Pearson said. “I mean just little 
different things until you feel comfortable. 
‘Okay, she can do it. She’s doing the rest of 
the group’s.’
 “It’s a process, so I think after a year then, 
yeah, you know them. They know you. You 
feel comfortable with them.”
 Comfortability, though, was a two-way 

street. 
As 
Pearson 
started to see the 
Andersons more as a family, they 
saw him as more than a guest 
and started treating him as such 
— even more than before.
 At the start, he would get away 
with some small pet peeves, but 
after a year, they were 
more than willing 
to lay down the 
law — Glenn 
Anderson, 
John’s 
dad, in 

particular.
 Glenn was 
a by-the-book, 
militant parent. 
As a well-respected 
businessman, he carried 
himself with high regards and held others to 
the same standards. As a father, he knew the 
things he had to do to raise his sons.
 So when Pearson rushed down to the 
base of the stairs one Monday morning his 
senior year, Glenn stopped him. The door 
was within arm’s reach, and Pearson would 
have been free to go to school.
 But Pearson had gone the full weekend 
without shaving and looked scruffy. He 
didn’t think there was much hair, but Glenn 
disagreed. Glenn wasn’t going to let Pearson 
go to school looking like that.
 “Pearson,” Glenn called.
 Pearson loosened his sights from the door, 
turned and lowered his head to meet his 
billet dad’s eyes. He was taller than Glenn, 
but the 5-foot-9 frame felt large in the 
moment.
 “Get upstairs and shave,” Glenn told him.
 When Pearson first met him, he 
thought Glenn was a hardass. He had a 
presence about him — powerful, but not 
overpowering.
 “My dad didn’t say a lot of words, but when 
he did, you probably should be listening,” 
John said.
 But Pearson grew comfortable with him, or 
at least, comfortable enough to argue back.
 The bus was coming, he countered, and if 
he missed it, he would be late for school.
 “I don’t care. I’ll drive you to school,” Glenn 
told him. “Get your ass upstairs and shave.”
 “And I’m going, ‘Come on man, like I hardly 
have anything. Big deal.’ ” Pearson said.
 But it was a big deal — at least to Glenn. He 
doesn’t go unshaven. A respectable image 
goes a long way, and so Pearson went back 
upstairs, shaved and Glenn drove him to 
school that day.
 “He was like that,” Pearson said. “He wasn’t 
afraid to lay down the law and sort of be a 
true dad, not just let me float.”
 That’s not how Pearson’s dad would have 
done it. Mel claims his dad would have said, 
“Hey, go ahead,” and let him leave unshaven, 
but Glenn was different. 
 “I think he knew the responsibility of being 
a father,” Pearson said. “And I was just like 
another one (of his) sons or daughters, and I 
was going to get treated that way.”
***

 In large 
part, 
staying 
with the 
Andersons 
helped Pearson 
stay out of 
trouble.
 “It’s like 
having a 
guest 
in 

your 
house 
for eight 
years. 
You have to be on 
your best behavior,” John said. 
“There’s your family and then 
there’s guests.”
 But the line got blurred. 
Pearson became both a guest 
and family. And that’s when 
Pearson’s devious nature started 
to show, with the jokester in him 
jumping out.
 When Pearson took part in Senior 
Skip Day, it was John who tried to cover 
for him when the homeroom teacher 
confronted him.
 “I tried to steer him away from trouble 
in school and stuff like that,” John said. 
“But there’s only so much you can do.”
 It was a friend looking out for a friend. 
A brother showing some love to another 
going out of line.
 That bond would stick with them 
through the years. No matter how 
far they were, no matter if Pearson 
eventually left for Michigan Tech in 
Houghton or moved to Ann Arbor to 
coach the Wolverines, he would stay in 
touch. Every break, he would come back 
to the Andersons. After he graduated, 
he didn’t go home to Flin Flon. He came 
back to Edina.
 “If you need to call him, you know, he’s 
always been there,” John said. “And I 
know that he always will be there. Just 
because we shared eight years being 
family together.
 “He’s like a brother to me.”
 Years later, after Glenn had passed, 
and Margie was sick in a hospital in 
Minnesota, Pearson was by her side with 
the rest of the family before she passed 
away. 
 Pearson still talks to John’s two sisters 
on occasion. He even asks his younger 
sister, Mary Beth, questions every now 
and then in regards to raising his own 
daughters.
 And he keeps in touch with John to this 
day. In the past seven days, he has already 
reached out twice. When either have 
struggles or successes or just anything on 
their minds, they’ll let the other know. 
There were few words Pearson had to 
describe what John meant to him, but 
two would always come up.
 A brother. Family. The moment he 
stepped foot on that stone porch, arms 
full of bags and suitcases, Pearson 
became so much more than the neighbor 
next door. 
 “I wish everybody could have an 
experience like that,” Pearson said. “Have 
another family.”
