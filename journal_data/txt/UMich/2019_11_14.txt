Ahead 
of 
the 
start 
of 
contract negotiations between 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization and the University 
of Michigan, approximately 200 
GEO members and supporters 
convened on the Diag for a 
rally 
Wednesday 
morning. 
Demonstrators 
marched 
to 
the Michigan League, where 
contract negotiations began.
GEO president Emily Gauld, 
a Rackham student, said GEO 
is taking part in a nationwide 
campaign 
to 
improve 
the 
accessibility 
of 
graduate 
education, 
explaining 
this 

starts with a strong union 
contract.
“This is the first day of what 
will be a month-long process, 
where there will inevitably be 
a compromise made on every 
side,” Gauld said to the crowd. 
“If we, the graduate employees 
and the GEO members at 
the University of Michigan, 
continue to show up every step 
of the way to show support for 
our team, for our platform and 
for our union, the University 
will hear us. We get what we 
are organized to take.”
At the end of the winter 
2017 semester, the University 
and GEO reached a contract 
agreement that included pay 

caps on mental health services, 
the formation of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion Graduate 
Student 
Student 
Assistant 
positions 
and 
increased 
protections for international 
graduate 
students. 
This 
contract — which expires on 
May 1, 2020 — came after 27 
bargaining sessions, multiple 
sit-ins and threats of a walk-
out.
GEO bargaining committee 
co-chair Sumeet Patwardhan, 
a Rackham student, said some 
of this year’s proposals include 
improved mental health and 
transgender health coverage, 
mitigating pay inequity among 
graduate 
students 
on 
the 

three 
University 
campuses 
and having gender-inclusive 
restrooms 
available 
across 
campus. He said the platform 
is the most ambitious GEO has 
ever created.
“If you’re out there feeling 
like other people are better 
equipped to win this platform 
than 
you, 
remember 
the 
strength of a democratic union 
is not in its leadership, but in 
its membership,” Patwardhan 
said to the crowd. “Let’s let the 
vision of our platform motivate 
us. Let’s let our solidarity 
immunize us to the divide and 
conquer tactics, and let’s win 
the platform we deserve.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Tim Sloan, University of 
Michigan alum and retired 
chief executive officer of 
Wells Fargo Bank, discussed 
“Building Trust in Crisis” 
as part of the Business 
and Society 2020 speakers 
series Wednesday morning. 
Sloan graduated from the 
University with a BA and 
MBA and spent 30 years at 
Wells Fargo before becoming 
the CEO in September 2016. 

Sloan 
assumed 
the 
position 
following 
the 
company’s 
disclosure 
employees 
had 
opened 
nearly 2 million deposit 
and credit card accounts 
without 
customers’ 
knowledge, being forced to 
pay a $185 million fine from 
the 
Consumer 
Financial 
Protection Bureau. 
Lindy 
Greer, 
associate 
professor 
of 
Management 
and 
Organizations 
and 
faculty 
director 
of 
the 
Sanger Leadership Center, 

moderated the conversation 
and began by discussing the 
mission of the Business and 
Society 2020 speakers series.
“We have a responsibility 
to honor our mission to make 
sure that in the sessions 
we’re touching on issues that 
are foremost in society right 
now, which is challenging,” 
Greer 
said. 
“Equality, 
sustainability, 
education, 
economic growth. The goal of 
the series is to bring together 
a lot of leaders, industry 
leaders 
and 
professional 

development 
opportunities 
for students to engage in 
structured dialogue about 
this intersection of business 
and society and how the 
system positively engaged 
society is all from these most 
pressing challenges.”
The discussion focused on 
the building of trust between 
businesses and society as it 
pertains to Wells Fargo and 
Sloan’s role in a leadership 
capacity.

A 17-year-old boy is believed 
to be the first vape-injured 
patient in the U.S. to receive a 
double lung transplant in order 
to save his life. 
The 
procedure 
was 
performed 
at 
Henry 
Ford 
Hospital in Detroit on Oct. 
15, doctors said at a news 
conference on Tuesday. Dr. 
Hassan 
Nemeh, 
surgical 
director 
of 
thoracic 
organ 
transplants at Henry Ford 
Hospital, said in a statement 
this procedure was crucial to 
the boy’s survival. 
“This 
teenager 
faced 
imminent death had he not 
received a lung transplant,” 
Nemeh said. 
 The boy — who turned 17 
while in the hospital — was 
first admitted to Ascension St. 
John Hospital in Detroit with 
symptoms of pneumonia on 
Sept. 5. However, his health 
quickly deteriorated, and he 
was transferred to Children’s 
Hospital of Michigan where 
he was placed on a machine 
to keep his heart and lungs 
active. Five days later, he was 
moved to Henry Ford Hospital 
for the operation.

Wednesday 
evening, 
the

Medicine 
Department 
of

hosted 
its 
24th 
Annual 
Waggoner Lecture on Ethics & 
Values in Medicine, featuring 
medical 
doctor 
Pamela 
K. 
McPherson. 
McPherson’s 
lecture 
focused 
on 
her 
experience witnessing harmful 
conditions 
in 
immigration 
detention centers along the U.S. 
- Mexico border, and her ethical 
dilemma over what to do with 
this confidential information.
McPherson 
is 
a 
medical 
doctor 
triple-boarded 
in 
general, child and adolescent, 
and forensic psychiatry, and 
also works as an expert for 
the Department of Homeland 
Security’s Office of Civil Rights 
and Civil Liberties. 
As a mental health expert 
for 
the 
CRCL, 
McPherson 
was working under a non-
disclosure 
agreement 
— 
a 
condition common for this 
position. She was trusted in the 
family residential facilities she 
visited. She toured the physical 
grounds, interviewed women 
and children and examined 
mental health records.

The city of Ann Arbor 
and 
nearly 
40 
partner 
organizations 
hosted 
a 
town hall on Wednesday at 
Cobblestone Farm to discuss 
how to help Ann Arbor 
approach carbon neutrality. 
At the event, more than 100 
community members shared 
ideas and concerns regarding 
the city’s potential transition 
to net zero carbon emissions.
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher Taylor opened 
the town hall by explaining 
Ann Arbor values carbon 
neutrality. 
“Ann Arbor is a place 
that prides itself on its 
environmentalism,” 
Taylor 
said. “This is something that 
is really important to the 
heart of our community.”
In a City Council meeting 
on Nov. 4, councilmembers 
voted to declare a state of 
climate 
emergency 
and 
passed a resolution to achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2030. 
Taylor said Ann Arbor has 
personally experienced the 
effects of climate change, 
referencing a one degree 
temperature increase during 

the last few years as well as a 
more than 45 percent increase 
in precipitation within the 
last 50 years. In 2017, the 
city allocated $880,000 to 
climate action, and the Office 
of Sustainability created a 
climate action plan for the 
next five years.
Additionally, 
Taylor 
said the city plans to have 
additional carbon neutrality 
town halls in the coming 
weeks 
to 
open 
up 
the 
conversation to more of the 
community. 
Following Taylor, Regina 
Strong, 
environmental 
justice public advocate for 
the Michigan Department 
of 
Environment, 
Great 
Lakes and Energy, spoke on 
environmental justice. Strong 
said community members 
must work together to create 
positive change.
In her presentation, Strong 
said 
the 
Environmental 
Protection Agency defines 
environmental 
justice 
as 
the 
fair 
and 
meaningful 
involvement of all people with 
respect to the development, 
implementation 
and 
enforcement 
of 

environmental 
laws, 

regulations and policies.

“Wells Fargo, which had 
been one of the most admired 
companies in the world … The 
year before that (2016) we were 
the 
most 
valuable 
financial 
institution on earth by market 
capital,” Sloan said. “In fact, 
you can go back and look at the 
Wall Street Journal headlines, 
you can see that. But we, in 
hindsight, made some really big 
mistakes.”
Once Sloan took the role, 
he worked with his 250,000 
person company to review and 
restructure the organization. 
He said given the situation, the 
bounce-back had to be a team 
effort. Sloan described how he 
had to distance himself from 
his coworkers in order to make 
difficult choices.
“What we needed to do is 
really step back and look at what 
were the issues and what we will 
do to address those,” Sloan said. 
“I needed to look at things in a 
very objective way. And that was 

hard… because I love the people. 
And I love the business.”
He said once he became 
CEO he had to reorganize the 
company, transitioning it from 
a decentralized organization 
to a more centralized company 
through 
consolidating 
enterprise 
functions 
and 
separate finance groups.
“We needed to reorganize the 
company,” Sloan said. “When 
you have an issue to deal and 
you make mistakes, sometimes 
that organization becomes very 
insular and insulated and doesn’t 
get to the bottom of issues 
doesn’t invite perspectives from 
across the company as it should 
and it makes the problem worse 
as opposed to better.”
Sloan 
explained 
the 
way 
the 
company 
worked 
to 
repair their relationship with 
their 
employees 
and 
their 
customers. 
He 
said 
after 
taking responsibility for the 
situation, he held frequent town 
halls where employees asked 
unscripted 
questions. 
Wells 
Fargo also began doing pulse 
surveys and receiving frequent 

feedback 
from 
community 
members. He invited people 
to directly send him an email 
or contact him, to which he 
would respond personally. From 
this feedback, the company 
raised member compensation, 
granted restricted stock rights 
to 
250,000 
employees 
and 
expanded paid parental leave.
“All this was based on the 
feedback we were getting,” 
Sloan said. “I knew that we 
could be successful at dealing 
with all the challenges and the 
opportunities that we have 
and to satisfy all our other 
stakeholders, unless we didn’t 
win the hearts and minds of our 
managers, our stakeholders and 
various businesses.”
Wells Fargo has over 70 
million consumer customers — 
one in three Americans, Sloan 
added. He said repairing that 
relationship 
and 
increasing 
communication 
helped 
the 
company rebound.
“The key was to make sure 
that there was an open level of 
communication,” 
Sloan 
said. 
“The fact of the matter is that 
most of our customers, 
they didn’t care about 
the mistakes that we had 
made. They wanted to 
know that we are going to 
make them right.”
Sloan 
explained 
the 
power and spotlight that 
comes 
with 
the 
CEO 
position. He said this 
spotlight allows one to 
make an unimaginable 
difference. However, he 
described 
the 
negative 
effects that came with 
it, when he would see 
something negative about 
himself 
in 
the 
news. 
He also described an 
instance in which 200 
protestors stood outside 
his California home. 
He 
provided 
advice 
following this experience. 
He said it’s important 
not to say the first thing 
that 
comes 
to 
mind 
when instances like this 
occur, as well as how to 
learn to deal with it. He 
emphasized 
resisting 
taking 
the 
attacks 

personally. 
Sloan circled back to the title 
of the conversation: leadership 
and trust during a crisis. He 
recommended 
companies 
emulate that style of leadership 
daily.
“I really believe that one of 
the things that I’ve learned as 
we move from being in a period 
of crisis to having to be much 
more balanced from a leadership 
standpoint, it was the same kind 
of structure, the same type of 
oversight, the same government 
governance model, the same 
type of feedback and the way 
that we interact with our team,” 
Sloan said. “I’ve learned is that 
businesses should operate as if 
they’re in crisis every day of the 
week.”
Sloan went on to say the best 
way to make quick decisions 
is to gather a diverse group of 
people to get varying opinions 
issues. He emphasized having 
the courage to hold a different 
opinion than the others in the 
group, but recognizing when 
you are wrong.
“Don’t be afraid to take a 
position that’s fundamentally 
different from the way that the 
company or you had operated 
the day before, the month 
before,” Sloan said. “Sometimes 
that change can be incredibly 
important 
and 
incredibly 
valuable.”
Finally, Greer asked Sloan 
how he knew when it was time 
for him to retire. He explained 
that following 32 years at the 
company, he no longer felt the 
company benefited from his 
leadership.
“That was a really hard 
decision for me,” Sloan said. 
“I love the people at Wells 
Fargo. They’re some of my best 
friends… 
Having 
said 
that, 
you also need to appreciate, 
when you’re a CEO, that it’s not 
about you. You work for your 
shareholders. And I always 
said to our board, and to my 
wife … the point at which I 
don’t think that I had enough 
value for the company, I need 
to not be seen.”

Center of the city task force 
focuses on community feedback

Ann Arbor opens online survey to hear residents’ concerns on transition process

AYSE ELDES 
For The Daily 

After a week of soliciting 
community feedback through 
a pop-up DecaDome in Ann 
Arbor’s Library Lot, the Center 
of the City Task Force met at 
Larcom City Hall on Wednesday 
to discuss residents’ ideas. The 
task force, formed after voters 
approved to amend the City 
Charter, has been working to 
decide how to make use of the 
Fifth Avenue site. 
According 
to 
Meghan 
Mussolf, committee chair of 
the Center of the City task 
force, the committee has been 
meeting for about four months 
and is halfway through its 
allotted time to formulate a 
decision on the space. Mussolf 
took time during the meeting to 
thank the group for their effort 
to gather community feedback 
thus far. 
“I 
think 
we’ve 
done 
a 
tremendous amount of work 
and 
good 
work 
to 
come 
together and really move the 
conversation forward,” Mussolf 
said. “We now have the luxury 
of having a lot of feedback.”
Heather Seyfarth, project 

manager of the task force and 
an Ann Arbor city manager, 
reported 
an 
online 
survey 
posted on Nov. 12 received 247 
responses within 24 hours. The 
survey will be open until Dec. 6. 
The group is now transitioning 
toward compiling this data to 
formulate an understanding on 
how Ann Arbor residents want 
the space to be utilized. 
The main obstacle facing 
the task force is efficiently 
reviewing the feedback. Task 
force member Norman Tyler 
suggested delegating blocks of 
survey responses to be reviewed 
by each member. Tyler deemed 
it unnecessary for each person 
to read every response and 
explained a common consensus 
among members that time was 
becoming a looming constraint. 
Vocal critics of this comment 
included task force member 
Alan Haber and Ann Arbor 
resident 
Odile 
Hugonot-
Haber. Though most members 
expressed awareness minority 
voices were missing in the 
group, Haber said Ann Arbor 
residents were generally not 
aware of the city’s activity 
around the “Center of City” 
and the task force should focus 

on informing residents about 
their activity. He and member 
John Haines were assigned to 
a subcommittee tasked with 
producing 
an 
informative 
pamphlet to be sent as target 
mail to the community. 
“Of the people we talked to 
at the DecaDome, very few of 
them knew what was going 
on,” Haber said. “I did not get 
a sense that Ann Arbor people 
know what’s happening. This 
returns to my sense that we 
should be sending out some 
sort of invitation or report to 
the whole community. And 
basically, we’re dealing not 
with a base that has thought 
about this at all.”
During the Center of the City 
Task Force’s next two meetings, 
selected residents in Ann Arbor 
will be invited to share their 
input on the project. Invited 
speakers will include business 
owners, a representative from 
the 
police 
department 
and 
other voices the group felt had 
not yet been represented.
Feeling community backing 
for a new park was not being 
acknowledged 
enough, 
Hugonot-Haber 
spoke 
to 
the 
task 
force 
about 
the 

advantages this addition to 
Ann Arbor would bring. Citing 
benefits 
such 
as 
common 
space interaction and cultural 
enrichment, 
“In the city itself, the people 
are a tremendous resource,” 
Hugonot-Haber 
said. 
“They 
have many ideas and solutions 
to problems, and we should 
capitalize more on the resource 
we have within our city.”
Hugonot-Haber, 
who 
disagreed 
with 
task 
force 
member 
and 
LSA 
senior 
Hannah 
Boettcher’s 
dissent 
of a formal partnership with 
the Ann Arbor Library Green 
Conservancy, urged the task 
force to favor partnership with 
the group in its future activity 
with decision-making. 
“I can understand you guys 
don’t want to do things together, 
but at least it should be, when 
you talk about them it should 
be a little more respectful,” 
Hugonot-Haber said. “If not, I 
think you’re doing a good job, 
and I hope you get very excited 
because it’s a very cutting 
edge work that you are doing, 
and I think it will make a big 
difference.”

MODERATOR: 
NANCY WANG 

“My 
professional 
ethical 
obligation 
to 
maintain 
confidentiality and the trust 
placed in me as a mental health 
subject 
matter 
expert 
are 
obligations that I had kept for 
my 30 years of forensic work,” 
McPherson said. “That is, until 
2018 — in July 2018, after fully 
considering this trust and my 
ethical obligations as a physician 
I became a whistleblower.” 
McPherson’s work focuses 
on 
studying 
children 
and 
adolescents, 
known 
as 
unaccompanied 
minors 
in 
immigration proceedings. In 
the United States, different 
agencies 
have 
different 
control 
over 
different 
facilities, providing a range 
of 
complicated 
bureaucratic 
difficulties 
for 
evaluating 
conditions and policies. Legally 
unaccompanied minors can be 
held up to 72 hours in Customs 
and Patrol Border facilities, 
before they are transferred to 
the Department of Health and 
Human Services.
“The average length of stay 
for an unaccompanied minor in 
a DHH facility in 2018 was 60 
days,” McPherson said. 
The 
number 
of 
unaccompanied 
migrant 
children has been continuously 
increasing since 2015, as well 
as the number of immigrants 
in detention centers as a whole, 
according to McPherson.
“In 2018, ICE held an average 
of 42,000 per day, including 
an average of 2,113 in family 
detention, at a cost of over 
8 million dollars per day,” 
McPherson said. 
With many of these centers 
becoming 
significantly 
overcrowded, McPherson and 
her colleagues observed the 
harmful effects on everyone, 
especially children as they were 
separated from their families. 
“I could barely contain my 
outrage,” 
McPherson 
said. 
“I’m a child and adolescent 
psychiatrist. 
I’m 
a 
medical 
doctor 
who 
specializes 
in 
helping 
children 
with 
overwhelming 
emotions. 
I 
help children and families be 

stronger, but I was watching 
them be torn apart.”
She 
explained 
that 
with 
children, the trauma of being 
detained causes them to regress, 
and hinders their ability to 
recognize 
safe 
relationships 
upon release. Even when their 
mother or father is simply 
dropping them off at school for 
the day, they may feel like they 
are being abandoned all over 
again, and become inconsolable. 
These impacts increase the 
longer they are detained, and 
are especially exacerbated when 
the length of their detention is 
unknown. 
“I knew children were being 
harmed, and that I should act, 
but I didn’t know what to do,” 
McPherson said.
Robert Sain, a community 
child psychiatrist in southeast 
Michigan, attended the lecture 
and told The Daily he related 
to 
McPherson’s 
experiences 
through his experience working 
in 
Detroit 
with 
Mexican 
immigrants. 
“It takes a lot out of me because 
all of these families have been 
traumatized — the kids have 
been traumatized, their parents 
have been traumatized, it goes 
on for generations,” Sain said. 
“I get very frustrated with the 
lack of resources, or concern, for 
helping these families.” 
McPherson’s colleague Scott 
Allen, also an expert for CRCL, 
reached out after working in 
the Department of Homeland 
Security together in 2014 and 
they discussed their course 
of action. Both were worried 
about the legal repercussions of 
speaking out — on themselves, 
and on their families, coworkers, 
employers 
and 
patients. 
McPherson 
recalled 
several 
people 
discouraging 
them, 
claiming that the letter would 
not affect any real change and 
that it was better to stay quiet, 
considering the risks. 
McPherson also discussed 
the dilemma over working for 
an organization that causes 
the 
harms 
she 
witnessed. 
Margo 
Schlanger, 
professor 
at the University of Michigan 
Law School and the former 
presidentially-appointed officer 
for CRCL, elaborated on the 
ethics of this in an interview 

with The Daily.
“The question is, is reform the 
right approach, or does reform 
entrench 
the 
problematic 
institution?” Schlanger posed. 
“I’m a believer in trying to 
address ongoing harm while you 
also try to get rid of the thing 
that causes the harm.”
The 
pair 
sought 
legal 
counsel from the Government 
Accountability 
Project, 
and 
decided to write a letter to 
Congress, rather than an Op-ed 
as originally planned. 
“The fundamental flaw of 
family detention is not just the 
risk posed by the conditions 
of 
confinement 
— 
it’s 
the 
incarceration 
of 
innocent 
children itself,” the letter reads. 
“Detention of innocent children 
should never occur in a civilized 
society, especially if there are 
less restrictive options, because 
the risk of harm to children 
simply cannot be justified.” 
The New York Times caught 
hold of their letter, garnering 
the 
attention 
and 
support 
of 
14 
professional 
medical 
organizations. The president 
of the American Psychological 
Association reached out to them 
personally, thanking them for 
their moral courage. Allen and 
McPherson also received letters 
from children their letter had 
affected, thanking them. 
“I was reminded that our 
children are always watching 
and listening, [and] when we 
use our voice, we give them 
hope and teach them that 
change is possible, if we take 
action,”McPherson said.
Deborah Pinals, director of 
the Program in Psychiatry, Law, 
and Ethics at the University, 
helped introduce McPherson 
and later reflected on the 
importance of the lecture in an 
interview with The Daily. 
“In today’s climate when 
there’s so much in the press 
about immigration, detention, 
and detention of families and 
children,” Pinals said. “I think 
what 
was 
really 
important 
was to hear about the ethical 
dilemma 
of 
the 
physician 
working trying to improve 
conditions of confinement and 
then finding out that the very 
conditions were harmful in and 
of themselves.”

Patwardhan said 20 working 
groups within GEO have built 
the platform over the last seven 
months. He noted the importance 
of showing up to membership 
meetings and bargaining-related 
events over the months ahead.
State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, shared his support 
for GEO at the rally. He said 
GEO is an example of what 
graduate students elsewhere can 
accomplish if they unionize. 
“You’re fighting for an issue 
that is about the future of our 
state and that is about making 
sure that everyone has access to 
a good-quality education,” Rabhi 
said. “On behalf of the people of 
the 53rd District, I want to thank 
you for your work in furthering 
the issue of social justice and 
furthering the issues of economic 
justice in our state. What you’re 
doing here in Ann Arbor is setting 
the stage for what can happen in 
other parts of the state, too, when 
graduate employees organize, 
stick together and fight for their 
rights.”
After the rally, the group 
marched to the Michigan League, 
reciting 
chants 
encouraging 
the University to listen to their 
demands. Before the bargaining 
team 
went 
inside 
to 
begin 
negotiations, Devlin Mallory, a 
Rackham student and member of 
the team, addressed the crowd.
Mallory said the likelihood of 
their demands being met is tied to 

GEO’s organizing. He encouraged 
members 
and 
supporters 
to 
continue showing up for events 
and thanked the hundreds of 
union members who contributed 
to the building of their platform.
“Our strength at the bargaining 
table doesn’t come from rhetorical 
skills or the logical soundness 
of our arguments, it comes from 
the power of our membership,” 
Mallory said. “As the bargaining 
team, we’re excited to continue 
the 
progress 
you’ve 
started 
and win an equitable and just 
contract.”
University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email to 
The Daily negotiations between 
the University and GEO will 
happen twice every week going 
forward. 
He 
characterized 
Wednesday’s initial session as 
“productive.”
In a written statement to The 
Daily, Sascha Matish, associate 
vice 
provost 
for 
academic 
affairs and senior director of 
academic human resources, said 
the University is committed to 
working with the GEO to develop 
a contract both parties can agree 
upon.
“We recognize the importance 
of Graduate Student Instructors 
and 
graduate 
student 
staff 
assistants 
to 
the 
academic 
mission of the university and 
to the academic success of our 
students,” Matish wrote. “We are 
committed to bargaining in good 
faith with GEO to reach a fair 
agreement that serves the interest 
of all parties.”

In the conference the doctors 
explained the boy’s lungs were 
damaged in a way they had not 
previously seen, specifically citing 
shocking inflammation, scarring 
and dead tissue. 
“This is an evil that I haven’t 
faced before,” Nemeh said. 
 
Dr. 
Lisa 
Allenspach, 
a 
pulmonologist at Henry Ford, 
said the statement the vaping 
has created a real issue for the 
younger generations.
“Our adolescents are really 
faced with a crisis,” Allenspach 
said. “There was a study released 
last week that surveyed over 
10,000 middle school and high 
school students. And 28 percent 
of high school students reported 
ongoing use of e-cigarettes and 11 

percent of middle school students 
reported using e-cigarettes.”
Dr. 
Nicholas 
Yeldo, 
a 
cardiothoracic anesthesiologist, 
said in a statement he hopes the 
incident brings awareness to 
the greater issue in society with 
vaping.
“We are here today to beg the 
public to pay special attention to 
the special steps that were taken 
in this case. ... I beg of you, this 
was not just the unlucky one,” 
Yeldo said. “This is happening 
way too much to turn our heads 
to this.”
The family of the boy described 
him as a typical 17-year-old, who 
enjoys sailing, hanging out with 
friends and playing video games. 
In a statement, they said they 
hope to bring awareness to the 
dangers associated with vaping. 
“Within a short period of 
time, our lives have been forever 

changed. He has gone from the 
typical life of a perfectly healthy 
16-year-old athlete...” the family 
said, “to waking up intubated and 
with two new lungs, facing a long 
and painful recovery process as 
he struggles to regain his strength 
and mobility, which has been 
severely impacted.” 
The teen is on the road to 
recovery, but it could take months. 
In a statement to the Detroit Free 
Press, Nemeh explained the use 
of 
extracorporeal 
membrane 
oxygenation 
to 
replace 
the 
function of the lungs. 
“He is very close to being 
transferred to rehab,” Nemeh 
said. “However, because he was 
on the ECMO machine for almost 
a month with total sedation, he is 
incredibly weak.”

“In 
creating 
an 
equitable 
environmental 
future, 
you’re 
talking about the environment, 
which is critically important,” 
Strong said. “As you do your work, 
you have to be very intentional 
about who is a part of the 
conversation, who’s impacted by 
the work.”
 Strong said to work toward 
achieving carbon neutrality, the 
community should value inclusion 

by incorporating and valuing 
differences on a shared platform. 
She also said the community 
should take into consideration 
how the past shapes the present 
and 
social 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages to address equity.
“For justice to really be just, 
it has to come from everybody,” 
Strong said. “You learn so much 
more from having these diverse 
perspectives in the room.”
Missy 
Stults, 
Ann 
Arbor 
sustainability 
and 
innovations 
manager, also spoke at the town 
hall. Like Strong, Stults said the 

city must work together to be 
successful in achieving carbon 
neutrality 
and 
discussed 
the 
initiative 
to 
achieve 
carbon 
neutrality by 2030.
 Stults also revealed the logo 
for the new carbon neutrality 
initiative, called A2Zero.
“Carbon neutrality probably 
means something to all of you … 
but for many people, it doesn’t,” 
Stults said. “We want people to 
know they’re part of this, part of 
what it is we’re talking about. This 
isn’t a four month journey, this is a 
10-plus year journey.”

 The town hall then moved to let 
attendees express their ideas and 
concerns about climate neutrality 
through 
writing 
on 
various 
posters hung up throughout the 
event space. Topics of discussion 
included 
energy, 
adaptation, 
mobility and resource reduction. 
LSA senior Kristen Hayden, 
a staff member of Ann Arbor’s 
Department 
of 
Sustainability, 
told The Daily the decision to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 
is a reaffirmation of Ann Arbor’s 
commitment to being a sustainable 
city.

“Carbon neutrality ties into 
all facets of community living,” 
Hayden said. “This is not just about 
emissions and pollution but about 
people and their relationship to 
the community.”
Ideally, Hayden said a carbon 
neutrality plan should put frontline 
communities first and support 
their energy and lifestyle needs 
while getting the community to 
zero carbon emissions.
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Mary 
Garton volunteers with Citizen’s 
Climate 
Lobby 
and 
Climate 
Reality Project. She told The 

Daily working towards carbon 
neutrality is an important step 
in reducing the effects of climate 
change.
“Efforts need to be taken at the 
city, state, county and national 
levels to reduce carbon emissions, 
not only because of climate 
change but because of air quality 
and water quality,” Garton said. 
“National legislation is needed as 
is state legislation, but in reality, 
cities need to pick up the ball 
because we’re living here and this 
is where the changes will happen.”

The problem with trying to end ‘forever war’

The right to ride

A

ll 
three 
of 
the 
last 
presidents 
have 
emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
draw 
down 
American 
involvement beyond American 
borders. President George Bush 
ran an isolationist campaign and 
his 
administration 
proceeded 
to 
embrace 
neoconservatism 
and nation building. President 
Barack Obama decried Bush’s 
wars as a senator, but once he 
was elected, he amped them up 
to the point where there were 
troops in more countries when 
he left office than when he came 
in. President Donald Trump also 
ran an isolationist campaign and 
has embraced some of that in 
the White House. He also called 
Bush’s decision to go to war in 
Iraq “the single worst decision 
ever made.” President Trump is in 
charge of the military and could 
choose to bring the troops home. 
However, he probably will not 
– despite running on it – for the 
same reason America has stayed 
in the Middle East for as long as it 
has. While us being in the Middle 
East is problematic, us leaving 
does more damage and that is the 
paradox of the forever war. 
The “forever war” has many 
problems, but one major success 
has been that Americans have 
been kept safe in a way that they 
weren’t before. Since 9/11, there 
have been no attacks on that scale 
because of the global security 
apparatus that we helped build 
and then deploy. American power 
doesn’t just protect us – it protects 

civilians in the Middle East as 
well as civilians all over the world 
because of the deterrence factor. 
If Trump decides to withdraw 
troops and history is any guide, 
it could be followed by an even 
bigger deployment. 
The closest parallel to Trump’s 
pulling out of Syria before fully 
finishing the job is Obama’s 
pulling out of Iraq in 2011. At 
the time, Obama was anxious to 
fulfill a campaign promise, and 
he acted quickly to draw down 
the troop presence until it had all 
but evaporated by December 2011. 
In Iraq, there was still work to be 
done – just like there is in Syria – 
but domestic political desires and 
a general American weariness 
towards Middle East involvement 
outweighed 
that. 
However, 
Obama did end up redeploying 
troops to Iraq in one of the crueler 
twists of irony. Today, ISIS is at 
one of its lower points, but just 
like in Iraq, it is not done yet. In all 
likelihood, this will not be the end 
of American troops in Syria and 
rather than losing ground now 
and having to fight for it again, 
we would be better served staying 
there and maintaining our gains.
In addition to problems when 
we stop engaging, there are issues 
when we choose not to engage 
at all. There is no other nation 
that has both our values and 
our resources – in other words, 
there is no other nation that can 
police the world as well as we 
do. If we decide to draw down 
our foreign involvement out of 

some misplaced desire to let the 
world go on as it would, then the 
world would be a much more 
brutal place. Though there are 
occasional exceptions, American 
involvement abroad is generally 
a positive, and when we stay out, 
bad things tend to happen, such as 
the Rwandan genocide that took 
place in the 1990s. 
During that genocide, President 
Bill Clinton made a decision to 
avoid involvement because of the 
political blowback from the Battle 
of Mogadishu in Somalia. As a 
result, we watched hundreds of 
thousands of people die between 
April and July of 1994. Us not 
being involved didn’t make things 
better. In fact, it made things far 
worse for the people who were 
left to fend for themselves during 
one of the bloodiest episodes in 
human history. 
President George H.W. Bush 
once said that America is more 
than a country on the roll call 
between Albania and Zimbabwe, 
and he was right. We have a duty 
to uphold freedom, human rights 
and liberty and to help others 
who do the same. If we fail to do 
so, people will be victimized all 
over the world. While some may 
say those beyond our borders are 
not our problem, they are wrong. 
When we don’t act to prevent 
problems abroad, they come home 
to roost, and that tragedy should 
be avoided at all costs.

E

very time I buckle my 
bike helmet, I wonder 
if it will be my last 
ride. I commute to class by 
bike and train on the road 
as a competitive cyclist, and 
each day I worry if my safety 
precautions will be enough. 
In the past year, two of my 
teammates have been struck 
by vehicles and injured while 
they 
were 
following 
the 
rules of the road. Without 
asking for it, I’ve become an 
advocate for cyclists and bike 
infrastructure.
We love to hate cyclists. 
They’re on the road with the 
cars, taking up space and 
making it harder to drive. 
We love to tell stories about 
irresponsible cyclists running 
red lights or making it hard 
to pass. It is unfortunate that 
we generalize this group of 
road users and fail to bring 
up 
in 
these 
conversations 
the 
staggering 
number 
of 
irresponsible 
drivers 
that 
make roads equally unsafe 
spaces. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
cyclists are doing good for the 
world by reducing traffic and 
greenhouse gas emissions, I 
can put up with people who 
choose to see the negatives of 
road users on bikes. What I 
cannot put up with, however, 
are those who are unwilling 
to support the efforts to make 
roads safer and more effective 
for community users. The new 
two-way protected bike lane 
on East William Street is a 
step forward for everyone.
Recently, I was infuriated 
when the driver of my Uber 
mentioned his distaste for 
the road changes. He said he 

doesn’t like these types of new 
accommodations for cyclists 
because it makes the roads 
narrower and reduces parking 
space. 
He 
was 
concerned 
the narrower roads would 
cause more drivers to hit one 
another. While I’m sure he 
did not mean to, what he was 
implying was that he favored 
the protection of vehicles over 
the protection of human lives. 
Bike 
infrastructure 
saves 
human lives — I, personally, 
am unconcerned with a few 
extra cars getting dented.
What if the money used 
on this bike lane installation 
was 
instead 
used 
to 
fix 
other roads? Yes, that could 
happen, but if we are talking 
about the issue of potholes 
and disintegrating roads, we 
should also think about the 
damage to a road done by a 
person on a bike versus that 
by that same person in a motor 
vehicle. The cyclists of Ann 
Arbor are paying taxes just 
like everyone else, yet they 
are not doing nearly the same 
damage to roads.
People make jokes about 
how entitled the pedestrians 
are in Ann Arbor. They love 
to make fun of the idea that 
pedestrians 
walk 
in 
front 
of cars and are asking to 
be killed. I laugh at these 
jokes here and there, but I’m 
worried about how this humor 
may actually affect how we 
think about driving. Drivers 
often think they own the 
roads and that if something 
bad occurs, it’s because any 
pedestrian or cyclist involved 
was unpredictable or stupid. 
While we should all be alert on 
the road, the person with their 

hands on the wheel should not 
assume that the other road 
users are trying to get killed.
The way we think about 
pedestrian safety is closely 
linked to that of cyclist safety 
because these two groups 
both 
comprise 
vulnerable 
road users, meaning they have 
little or no external protection 
in the event of a collision. 
Crosswalks, 
sidewalks 
and 
well-known 
right-of-
way laws help make Ann 
Arbor a pedestrian-friendly 
community. 
Meanwhile, 
cyclists exist in a gray space. 
The pavement they use as 
transportation is designed for 
and shared with vehicles much 
larger and more powerful than 
them. 
The lack of parking in 
Ann Arbor is a disaster. The 
traffic in Ann Arbor is a 
disaster. The road quality in 
Ann Arbor is a disaster. The 
new bike lane is incentivizing 
biking as a safe and effective 
mode of commuting for the 
community. There are people 
who are hesitant to mount 
a bike because they know 
the 
threatening 
nature 
of 
motorists. People die all the 
time 
while 
following 
the 
rules of the road because of 
irresponsible 
drivers. 
But 
better 
bike 
infrastructure 
means more people on bikes, 
which means fewer in cars. 
And fewer cars means a better 
experience for people who 
live and work in Ann Arbor – 
including those who continue 
to drive.

L

ast Sunday, a group of 
students organized an 
event at the University 
of Michigan’s Ross School of 
Business called Israel Summit 
at Michigan to celebrate Israel. 
The 
summit’s 
stated 
goals 
were to “decrease anti-Israel 
sentiment on campus” and to 
“present Israel as the positive 
world contributor it is.” 
Members of Direct Action for 
Palestine and Students Allied 
for 
Freedom 
and 
Equality 
stood in protest against the 
event, taking issue with both 
of its stated goals. We marched 
to 
draw 
attention 
to 
the 
problematic nature of the event 
and to raise awareness of the 
ongoing 
settler 
colonization 
and military occupation of 
Palestine. After marching, we 
stood outside the summit with 
signs that read “Free Palestine” 
and “Occupation is not an 
innovation.” 
Despite being careful not 
to disrupt the actual events 
of the day and following the 
University’s protest guidelines, 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security used lies and 
intimidation to shut down our 
protest in violation of our First 
Amendment rights. DPSS said 
the event was private, but the 
event was promoted as open to 
all – not to mention, we were 
outside the event. They also 
said that only those registered 
could be there, but as students, 
we have the right to enter any 
building we normally have 
access to during the daytime. 
At another point, they said only 
students could be there, but 
as members of the University 
community, we can bring guests 
to campus. Finally, one officer 
repeatedly 
threatened 
an 
individual with a misdemeanor 
charge 
for 
covering 
their 
face with a scarf, but under 
Michigan state law, covering 
one’s face is legal except when 
committing a crime. As a 
Palestinian, the individual was 
protecting their identity to 
avoid ending up on a blacklist 
that could inhibit travel to their 
historic homeland. The officer’s 
threat led them to expose their 
face, putting them at risk. 
We are disturbed that DPSS 
would infringe on our right to 
free speech so blatantly and 
in violation of the University’s 
own guidelines. 
Why did we protest an event 
focused on celebrating how 
Israeli citizens and companies 
have 
contributed 
positively 
to 
the 
world? 
We 
believe 
that 
the 
technological 
and 

entrepreneurial contributions 
by 
Israeli 
companies 
are 
inseparable from the settler 
colonization 
of 
historic 
Palestine, the occupation of the 
West Bank, the siege of Gaza 
and violations of Palestinian 
human rights. Israel’s success 
is built on the oppression of 
Palestinians, and Palestinians 
are excluded from participating 
meaningfully in Israeli society. 
While Israelis enjoy a growing 
standard of living, cutting edge 
urban infrastructure and access 
to internationally recognized 
institutions of higher learning, 
Palestinians are losing their 
homes in demolitions, having 
their olive trees burned and 
are only offered inadequate, 
inconsistent internet access, 
which is controlled by Israel. 
The disparities are stark. 
One summit attendee argued 
that we misunderstood the 
conference, 
highlighting 
a 
summit speaker who founded 
PeacePlayers International, an 
organization that uses sports to 
“inspire young people to create 
a more peaceful world.” We 
support building relationships 
between Israeli and Palestinian 
children and see both groups as 
victims of Israel, but ultimately, 
Palestinian 
children 
cannot 
be held accountable for the 
conflict, and “positive attitudes” 
will not alleviate the inequality 
of Israel’s apartheid regime. 
We do not know whether 
PeacePlayers 
International 
ensures safe travel to and from 
playing sites for Palestinian 
participants. Regardless, any 
Palestinian traveling from the 
West Bank must travel across 
a segregated road system that 
forces them to take circuitous 
routes where they are subject 
to harassment by soldiers. And 
what about the children stolen 
from their homes in night raids 
and held in detention? How 
do they get to the basketball 
court? We are skeptical of 
any program that calls for 
peace without also calling for 
justice. Likewise, though the 
Israel Cancer Research Fund 
– whose Chicago Executive 
Director, Allyson Greenfield, 
was a speaker – contributes to 
fighting cancer, Palestinians 
in 
Palestine 
often 
cannot 
access medical care since most 
hospitals are on the other side 
of checkpoints. These require 
hard-to-get medical permits 
issued by Israel as well as 
arduous travel as a result of 
Israel 
illegally 
establishing 
Jewish-only settlements in the 
West Bank. 

In addition to not sharing in 
the spoils of Israel’s economy, 
 
Palestinian lives represent the 
cost of Israel’s “innovations.” 
The militarization of Israeli 
society has fueled the creation 
of numerous security-focused 
start-ups. The links between 
military service and security 
businesses 
have 
attracted 
global investors interested in 
Israel’s military and security 
technology. But, the technology 
that Israelis are celebrated for 
is used against Palestinians 
and “tested” on them. Israel has 
also made it clear that it is more 
than willing to sell weapons and 
surveillance tech to anyone and 
everyone, even for the purposes 
of genocide and the persecution 
of LGBTQ people. 
We 
stand 
against 
the 
portrayal of Israel as a positive 
force in the world while it 
systematically 
dispossesses, 
displaces 
and 
terrorizes 
Palestinians. 
Celebrating 
Israel’s 
accomplishments 
downplays that Palestinians 
living in the West Bank and 
Gaza 
lack 
access 
to 
basic 
resources, 
normalizes 
the 
legalized discrimination and 
exclusion faced by Palestinian 
Israelis 
and 
disguises 
that 
Israel’s wealth and power on 
the global stage have come at 
the cost of Palestinian self-
determination. 
The summit’s stated goal 
of 
decreasing 
anti-Israel 
sentiment 
on 
campus 
goes 
directly against DAP’s goal of 
advocating for a free Palestine. 
Israel is directly responsible for 
Palestinian living conditions, 
and it is our duty as members 
of 
an 
American 
university 
community 
to 
hold 
Israel 
accountable, given the close 
ties between the two countries. 
That 
the 
University 
would sponsor such an event 
demonstrates their disregard 
for Palestinian students and 
community members. We will 
not stand by in silence. We 
will not stop critiquing Israel 
loudly and in public as long as 
it threatens the existence of 
Palestinians and Palestine. We 
will continue to spread the word 
about the military occupation of 
Palestine. We will continue to 
call on the University to divest 
from companies profiting off of 
the suffering of Palestinians. 

Direct Action for Palestine is a 

coalition of students, grad students, 

faculty and community members that 

organizes for Palestinian liberation.

No, this doesn’t justify cultural appropriation
A

round Halloween, our 
campus 
was 
buzzing 
with the crucial question 
that plagued everyone the entire 
month of October: What will my 
Halloween costume be? As these 
conversations went on, posters 
were also put up throughout 
dorms 
and 
common 
areas 
suggesting how to avoid cultural 
appropriation 
with 
costumes. 
While I assumed that costumes 
that feed into blatant stereotypes 
are no longer a consideration, I 
have seen a handful of costumes 
on social media that do this, 
including 
 
people 
wearing 
“Indian” headdresses and dressed 
as Japanese geishas.
My stomach drops every time 
I see those costumes and I always 
ask myself: Why? Coming from a 
South Korean background, I have 
never seen a costume mimicking 
my culture. I have even showed 
pictures of “Asian” costumes to 
my family whom were natively 
born in Japan and South Korea, 
and they didn’t find anything 
wrong with it. So, why am I so 
furious about something that 
has no direct relation to me? My 
anger stems from getting teased 
for my bento lunch boxes and my 
family members dressing up in 
traditional Korean garb when I 
was a kid, and now, years later, all 
the things I was teased for are a 
trend that everyone wants to take 
part in. 
According to American poet 
Fatimah 
Asghar, 
“cultural 
appropriation 
occurs 
when 
members of a dominant group 
take elements and symbols of 
another culture for their own 
economic or social gain while 
simultaneously 
devaluing 
and 
silencing the bodies, opinions 
and voices of the oppressed 
culture.” This definition sets a 
standard and clear understanding 
as to the significance of cultural 
appropriation and what it means 
to 
various 
Americans. 
The 

disconnect between my family 
members born in East Asian 
countries and me, who grew 
up in the United States, reflects 
upon the dichotomy of how 
cultural appropriation is received 
among people of color. However, 
this difference should not be a 
justification for acts of cultural 
appropriation as the standard 
of disrespect is dictated from 
historical inequalities and not the 
opinions of any non-white person. 
In 2018, a high school senior 
wore a traditional Chinese qipao 
to prom, stirring controversy on 
Twitter and resulting in backlash. 
However, she also received a lot of 
support from natives in East Asia. 
Hong Kong cultural commentator 
Zhou Yijun is quoted in The New 
York Times saying “it’s ridiculous 
to criticize this (the prom dress) as 
cultural appropriation. From the 
perspective of a Chinese person, 
if a foreign woman wears a qipao 
and thinks she looks pretty, then 
why shouldn’t she wear it?” Most 
of the people who were offended 
were people who identified as 
Asian Americans and those with 
cross-national identities. 
Evidently, not all people of color 
recognize cultural appropriation 
in the same light as others. For 
example, East Asian countries that 
extend to — but aren’t limited to 
— China, Japan and South Korea 
have had instances of blackface 
on national television. Adored 
K-Pop groups have acclaimed 
to 
get 
“away 
with 
cultural 
appropriation” 
as 
they 
draw 
much of their inspiration from 
Motown bands. The difference 
between East Asian and American 
cultural appropriation of Black 
culture comes to a disconnect 
in awareness. East Asia is far 
more 
racially 
homogeneous, 
and thus certain stereotypes 
about Black culture and African 
Americans 
persist, 
explaining 
the inappropriate instances of 
blackface and mockery. The U.S. 

on the other hand is a country that 
has a more diverse population, 
and while ignorance may be the 
case for certain acts of cultural 
appropriation, the country also 
has a horrific history with how 
minority 
groups 
have 
been 
treated. 
This could be one way why 
cultural appropriation is arguably 
more of a prevalent issue in 
the U.S. as it is because of our 
historical context and systemic 
oppression that is unique to 
the country. Black Americans 
have historically been exploited 
and victimized by institutions. 
Professor Mia Moody-Ramirez, 
director of graduate studies at 
Baylor 
University, 
emphasizes 
how 
costumes 
that 
involve 
blackface go back to minstrel 
shows 
in 
the 
1800s, 
where 
white Americans appropriated 
African American culture for 
profit. It now perpetuates ill-
mannered stereotypes of being 
“lazy, unintelligent and criminal 
in 
nature.” 
These 
historical 
events that continue to affect 
these minority groups shouldn’t 
be mocked or mimicked, as 
many 
inappropriate 
costumes 
perpetuate negative stereotypes 
and gloss over the prevailing 
issues they encounter. 
It is integral to note that 
cultural appropriation can be 
inappropriate and rightfully offend 
certain marginalized groups. The 
weight of cultural appropriation 
and why it is inappropriate and 
disrespectful is dependent upon 
the history of America. So, while 
there remains a mixed reaction 
from different people of color, and 
further obfuscates why certain 
people of color get offended, an 
important variable to keep in mind 
is the context of what is being 
appropriated and what the bigger 
picture looks like.

Earlier in the year, the animators of one of Netflix’s 
long-running originals, “Bojack Horseman,” ratified 
a contract with The Animation Guild (TAG) to 
formally unionize and benefit from the protections 
that their colleagues in the writing and acting areas of 
the show were already receiving. It’s worth taking a 
deeper dive into just why such a move was important 
and how organized labor already plays a big part in 
the production of TV.

The Animation Guild in particular already serves 
most of Netflix’s animated shows produced in-house 
in Los Angeles. At its core, TAG, like any organized 
labor union, advocates for its members by way of 
establishing wage minimums, providing health 
benefits and negotiating with bosses. Specifically, 
TAG’s collective bargaining agreement ensures that 
time worked in excess of 40 hours a week will be 
paid at a higher hourly rate than the standard and 
provides provisions for dismissal pay.
Despite its relative stability in the present day, 
TAG’s history shows that the major studios in 
Hollywood have always attempted to withold any 
semblance of protection to some of its most essential 
workers. For example, the website notes “In the 1970s, 
the subcontracting of television animation to foreign 
subcontractors, known as ‘runaway production’ 
began to seriously affect employment.” While TAG 
won a case guaranteeing local employment, by 
the 1980s, the studios gained the upper hand and 

eventually most animation work was sent abroad.
While an animation “renaissance” of sorts 
countered the decline of the 1980s, history always 
shows that without organized labor, the studio 
executives will always take decisions to undermine 
the livelihoods of the people that make their shows. 
Many of the animators and other types of artists are 
freelancers, the type of workers that large studios 
love to exploit even more so than usual, making 
organizations like TAG that facilitate collective 
bargaining essential.
The writers on “Bojack” are themselves part of a 
union, the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Founded 
as a response to studios slashing wages for its writers, 
it too has actively advocated for the army of writers 
spread out across the TV, film and media landscape. 
As recently as April of this year, thousands of WGA 
members fired their talent agents as part of a protest 
against packaging fees, in which talent agencies 
take a cut of profits from the shows they work with 
rather than commissioning their clients. The WGA 
contends that this pseudo-“backdoor” arrangement 
eliminates the incentives for the agency to maximize 
their clients’ pay. 
The brutally competitive world of Hollywood and 
the ruthlessness of the executives who rule it make 
it an absolute necessity for the workers (writers, 
actors, artists, sound engineers, etc.), who make the 
whole thing spin to use their collective power. As 
consumers, it is important for us to recognize the 
precariousness of the situations so many Hollywood 
workers find themselves in and therefore support the 
efforts to allow them to continue making the art we 
know and love.

Labor unions are actually
what make Hollywood run

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

This past weekend, I had the opportunity to 
attend Yoni Ki Baat’s “Bravado” in Munger’s 
South Commons. (In the interest of full 
disclosure, I should explain that I attended the 
event largely to hear my amazing Daily news 
colleague, Claire Hao, read a piece about the 
abuse she faced earlier in her life.) I left the 
event both saddened by the alleged abuse and 
oppression that the speakers had faced and 
inspired by their willingness to confront it in 
such a public setting.
This got me thinking about art and tragedy. 
In particular, I was reminded of how effective 
art can be in allowing us to think about, react 
to and move past tragedy. I thought of the 
different ways that artists have chosen to react 
to tragic historical events, the different routes 
that artists have taken to reach an appropriate 
place of contemplation and reflection, of sad 
remembrance and meaningful thought towards 
the future.
In particular, I thought of the MUSKET 
“Cabaret” performance this past year. (Again, 
in the interest of full 
disclosure, I’ll mention 
that I was the bass player 
in the pit orchestra of this 
show. This role afforded 
me the opportunity to 
see the show many, many 
times and analyze it at 
length.)
For those unfamiliar 
with “Cabaret,” the show 
opens 
with 
a 
simple 
love story: An American 
writer living in Berlin, 
Cliff Bradshaw, begins 
to fall in love with a 
cabaret 
dancer, 
Sally. 
While many characters 
allude to socio-political 
upheaval throughout the 
first act, it is only at the 
very end of the act that 
the audience understands these oft-alluded-to 
changes to be rise of the Nazis and the end of the 
Weimar period.
I remember witnessing this moment of 
revelation for the first time and the inevitable 
punch to the gut that it evoked. I’d been laughing 
along with the characters, following their 
budding romances with great interest. But all 
of a sudden, I felt guilty — ignorant to a society 
that was turning increasingly anti-Semitic, 
complicitly oblivious to a political system 
moving irrevocably towards fascism.
One other aspect of “Cabaret” that I will never 
forget is the audience’s vocal responsiveness to 
the humor of the first act and the utter silence 
of the second act. At the beginning, for example, 
the sexual jokes of the Emcee, the host of the 
“Kit Kat Klub,” are quite funny and met with 
audible, and sometimes abundant, laughter. 
But in the second act, as the anti-Semitic 
undertones to the Emcee’s humor become 
more apparent, the audience neither laughs nor 
applauds. Yet the cast and crew play on, acting as 
though nothing has changed; it is not the nature 
of the humor that has changed, they seem to 
imply, but the audience’s understanding of its 
implications.
When I think of art that responds to tragedy 

— particularly art that responds to genocide, or 
the millions of pieces that seek to respond to the 
Holocaust — my initial assumption is that the 
pieces will be sad, frightening and powerful. 
I assume that they will appeal to pathos, 
reminding me of the emotional horrors of the 
Holocaust, for example, and the many reasons 
why we must never allow something like that to 
happen again.
But when it came to “Cabaret,” I was 
confronted with a totally different sensation. 
This was not “Schindler’s List.” I was not sad 
about humanity’s moral failings, but inspired 
by the actions of one brave individual. I was 
disgusted and guilty, angry at myself for not 
understanding the true implications of my 
thoughts. I was incredibly, irreversibly moved. 
I was unable to dismiss what I had witnessed 
because of the heroic actions of a few to save the 
many.
On the other hand, Penderecki’s “Threnody 
to the Victims of Hiroshima,” is a stunning, gut-
wrenching 10-minute work for string orchestra 
about the first use of atomic weapons in warfare, 
the bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima 
in World War II. The piece is the opposite of 
“Cabaret.” It evokes the horrors of its subject 
matter from its opening 
moment. It deals not in 
subtly or in unexpected 
plot devices but in abject 
terror, in abject sadness. 
Both works, I realized, 

compel 
audience 

members 
to 
think 
critically 
about 
their 
subject 
matter. 
But 
“Threnody” 
does 
this 
through 
raw, 
emotive 
force. It is one of the most 
frightening things that 
I have ever heard, one 
of the most frightening 
works 
of 
art 
that 
I 
have ever experienced. 
What 
“Cabaret” 

accomplishes 
through 
subtly, 
“Threnody” 
accomplishes 
through 
utter lack thereof.
Somehow, despite their disparate means, 
both works manage to achieve the same end. 
And in some way, strange as this may sound, I 
began to see the magic of the arts reflected in the 
diversity of these works. 
As Leonard Bernstein famously stated at 
a concert shortly after the death of John F. 
Kennedy, “this will be our reply to violence: to 
make music more intensely, more beautifully, 
more desperately than ever before.” It is through 
the arts that we respond to tragedy both 
personal and societal. It is through the arts that 
we address these events in all their emotional 
complexities.
As a composer, I’ve often been obsessed 
with the idea that music expresses what words 
cannot. But in the context of tragedy, I’ve begun 
to realize that the arts do more than that. In this 
context, the arts begin in a place past words. 
The best pieces of art, however, take us a step 
further: They connect places within ourselves 
that we hadn’t known existed to events and 
subject matters that we did not experience. They 
force us to think critically about ourselves and 
about society; they provide us with new areas 
of thought and demand from us new degrees of 
emotional complexity.

TV NOTEBOOK

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘YO LOVE’

“Yo Love” is a collaboration between Vince 
Staples, 6LACK and Mereba, released for 
Melina Matsoukas’s upcoming drama/thriller 
film, “Queen & Slim.” The combination of the 
three R&B artists is slightly unexpected, as 
Vince Staples has never collaborated with 
either before. The 
song itself is even 
more of a surprise, 
considering 
that 
Staples’s 
most 
recent 
releases 
have 
boasted 
the 
consistent 
uptempo, 
bassy 
sound that made 
him famous. “Yo 
Love” is not one of 
those songs, and is certainly more in line with 
the other two artists’ typical softer sound.
Although the single is not the first mellow 
track that Staples has been a part of, it is one 
of the few times we see a pure vulnerability 

in his subject matter. 6LACK and Mereba 
take on the chorus of the song, combining 
their smooth vocals to continue the love story 
Staples begins to tell at the start. It’s refreshing 
and exciting to see such a shift in sound from 
a rapper like Staples, and this single further 
proves the breadth 
of his talent. The 
classic, 
hard-rap 
sound of his full-
length 
albums 
and most of his 
EPs and mixtapes 
cannot and should 
not be replaced, 
but that doesn’t 
mean it isn’t nice 
to 
switch 
up 
the tempo every once in a while. “Yo Love” 
is the perfect, sappy break that Staples’s 
discography needed.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘FOLLOW GOD’

In 
2019, 
Kanye 
West 
found 
himself 
reacquainted with two of the most important 
men in his life: the Lord, his Father (spiritually), 
and Ray, his father (biologically). With the 
release of the music video for “Follow God,” 
Kanye enjoys the presence of both of them.
The video opens with a monologue from Ray, 
during which he poses the question, “What does 
it really mean to follow God?” and answers by 
recalling the first time he guided his fearful 
children through their 
first snowfall. He states 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
“Walk in the footprints 
that 
(he’s) 
already 
made.” Ray and Kanye 
are decked out in a 
set of Walls-branded 
insulated coveralls and 
overalls, 
respectively. 
They proceed to take a couple of Kanye’s all-
terrain vehicles (a blacked-out, yet family-
focused Polaris RZR and a blacked-out, yet 
completely impractical SHERP) around Kanye’s 
4,000-acre ranch in Cody, Wyo. and collectively 
enjoy the gifts their God gave them. The video 
closes with a blue-and-gold text slide inspired by 
the cover of Jesus is King. It details a sentimental 
and affecting exchange between Kanye and Ray, 
during which Kanye confesses, “It took me 42 
years to realize that my dad was my best friend.”

This video has a few similarities with the 
boisterous video for “Otis” from Jay-Z and 
Kanye’s earth-shattering 2011 release Watch 
the Throne, specifically the shots of the two men 
in each video whipping automobiles around an 
endless landscape, doing donuts and generally 
just vibing, but the two differ starkly. While 
both videos are triumphant, “Otis” gives off 
the vibe that, at the time, Kanye felt the need to 
prove himself to the world. The “Follow God” 
video, on the other hand, 
presents 
an 
entirely 
different man, one that 
is not only celebratory 
of his accomplishments 
but also content with 
where he is in life. He’s 
got nothing to prove to 
anyone anymore.
“Follow 
God” 
may 
seem like a relatively uneventful video for Kanye, 
whose last release was the utterly bizarre video 
for “Fade,” but that’s the point. He doesn’t need 
to generate publicity anymore. He can be the 
exact person he knows he is, and this sentiment 
is accurately reflected in the video’s focus on 
the relationship between Kanye and his dad. All 
Kanye needs are his family, his father and his 
God.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Growing up a hopeless romantic and a movie buff, I’ve always 
been in love with the idea of love. At nine years old, I swooned over 
the connection between Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins in “My 
Fair Lady;” at 11, I watched “Romeo + Juliet” religiously, and when 
I was 13, there was nothing dreamier than the cuttable tension and 
crude banter between Claire and Bender in “The Breakfast Club.” 
In my eyes, these couples were idealizable. I never considered that 
Professor Higgins had to transform Eliza in order for her to be lovable, 
that Romeo and Juliet’s bond was solidified more by lust than love 
or that the basis of Bender and Claire’s relationship was essentially 
verbal harassment. Considering this pattern, I started to wonder: 
Did every romantic relationship in film merely include the good and 
gloss over the bad and the ugly without a second thought? In order to 
tackle this question, I decided to reassess some of my favorite movie 
couples from my teenage years, Edward and Bella in “Twilight,” 
J.D. and Veronica in “Heathers” and Holly and Kit in “Badlands,” 
to come to grips with my and society’s 
potentially problematic romanticization of 
these on-screen relationships. 
The “Twilight” series was one of my first 
loves and, as an angsty fifth grader, Bella and 
Edward’s moody, supernatural and iconic 
courtship was PG-13 gold. My infatuation 
started with the books, which I devoured in 
a frenzy as a tween. There was something so 
entrancing about the tale of a paranormal 
romance shared between two wandering 
souls who met in a high school biology class. 
Thankfully, the end of the four-part saga was 
only the beginning for the franchise. In 2008, 
three years after Stephanie Meyer released 
the book, “Twilight” went to the silver screen, 
and a whole universe was created filled with 
adoring fans, future sequels and promises of 
memes, fanfiction and “Twihard” fan-clubbing 
for decades to come.
For anyone who somehow managed to avoid 
the “Twilight” fever that swept our generation, 
I’ll give a brief synopsis. Bella Swan, a 17-year-
old, semi-reclusive girl moves to the tight-knit, 
drizzly town of Forks, Wash., to live with her 
estranged father. Life in Forks looks unpromising and monotonous 
until a gorgeous, mysterious boy named Edward Cullen catches 
her eye. Long story short, Edward is revealed to be a vampire, the 
chemistry Bella and Edward share is otherworldly and by the end of 
the film, there is no doubt in their minds — or the audience’s for that 
matter — that they are soulmates. 
Since its release, my appreciation for “Twilight” has been 
unwavering, strengthened each year by annual rewatches and replays 
of the iconic soundtrack. Nevertheless, “Twilight” has always been 
divisive. For millions of young girls, teenagers and moms, “Twilight” 
was a pop-culture revolution, a rebirth of the romance novel that 
was desperately in need of revival. Not everyone shared this same 
optimism. For some, “Twilight” and its sequels prompted criticisms 
of poor acting, mockeries of ridiculous dialogue and a whole lot of 
flack for sexism. 
As a die-hard fan throughout middle school, “Twilight” could 
do no evil in my eyes. But I had also never viewed it through 
an analytical lens. After recently rewatching the saga with my 
roommates, I felt my 11-year-old blinders begin to fall, and I finally 
began to digest the criticisms. Was Bella giving women a bad name by 
coming off as “weak?” Was Edward’s temperament swoon-worthy, 
or paternalistic and condescending? Could I forgive these flaws, and 
most importantly, if loving “Twilight” was wrong, should I want to 
be right? 
The first criticism that I aimed to address was the one proposed 

about Bella’s fragility, and the overall representation of female 
dependence on men. In an article for The Atlantic, Ashley Fetters 
quotes Guardian writer David Cox, who bluntly labels the franchise 
as one that “‘ate feminism.’” Though a bold claim, Cox’s assessment 
cannot be swept under the rug. Fetters argues that the question of 
what exactly “Twilight” was trying to get at is still open for debate, 
elaborating that Edward and Bella’s romance could be interpreted by 
both “a cautionary tale about the dangers of unbalanced relationships, 
or as a commentary on the virtue of an unswervingly committed 
partner.” Such commentary reflects on Edward’s tendencies that 
skirt the line between creepy and protective, i.e. watching Bella 
while she sleeps without her knowing, scolding her for being clumsy 
and reaffirming her lack of power by vowing to always “protect” her 
from harm’s way. While I had always perceived Edward’s attention 
toward Bella to be affectionate and pure, perhaps his influence on 
her is more controlling than considerate.
Without Edward, Bella is portrayed as lost, thrown into a 
new school in a new town with a father she barely knows. All of 
Bella’s relationships before Edward are unfulfilling: Her mother is 
preoccupied with her younger boyfriend, her father feels like more 

of a stranger than a family member and her new friendships serve 
more as placeholders than genuine connections. Edward’s entrance 
into the picture represents a shift for Bella — an awakening from 
monotony, so to speak. But instead of functioning as an addition to 
her life, he becomes the center of it and a reason for living where there 
was, apparently, not one before. Bella’s growing desire is not only 
directed at Edward, but also at the world he belongs to. Her world is 
composed of divorced parents, ditzy friends and aimlessness, but his 
world is one filled with a loyal family, ageless beauty and unearthly 
powers. His is a world that Bella can only be a part of by association, 
which she soon realizes will never be enough. It is this realization 
that seduces Bella, the idea that Edward’s life of magnetism, beauty 
and strength is not quite hers, but eventually could be if she became 
a vampire. 
Bella’s goal of immortality would arguably be less worrisome if 
it weren’t for the fact that the person who dictates its fulfilment 
is Edward. He holds the power to change Bella, a reality that he 
continuously reminds her of, and objects to her wishes to be “turned,” 
justifying his reasoning with the logic that he wants to save Bella’s 
soul, since he no longer has his own. By practically eliminating 
Bella’s ability to exercise choice, Edward governs the path that her 
future will follow. Though it pains me to admit it, Edward’s initial 
refusal to change Bella may not be entirely motivated by authentic 
concern and adoration, but also by a concealed impulse to feel power 
over her.

The more I mulled it over, the more I began to realize that “Twilight” 
wasn’t the first time I’d kept my blinders on. Two of my favorite film 
relationships, J.D. and Veronica in the cult classic “Heathers” and 
Holly and Kit in “Badlands,” were also of questionable standing. 
While these two films differ from “Twilight” in their maturity levels 
and their much more obviously toxic romances, there is no doubt 
a pattern of illusory female control and real male power that runs 
between all three films. 
In the world of film, there seems to be a recurring tendency to 
romanticize relationships that revolve around violence, deception 
or infatuation, and to pass these relationships off as exceptional 
portrayals of love. The toxic and sinister relationship that director 
Michael Lehmann displays between charming-yet-psychotic J.D. 
and brilliant, quirky and fierce Veronica is one that sometimes comes 
off as romantic. When I first saw this film, I was wooed by J.D.’s bad-
boy, carefree attitude and, because of this, was partly able to set aside 
the fact that he murders his classmates and is completely deranged.
Though obviously diverging into a much darker genre than 
“Twilight,” J.D.’s allure for Veronica is much like Edward’s for Bella. 
Both boys extend the opportunity for an escape from the mundane 
pattern of high school life. Like Bella, Veronica 
finds herself immersed in J.D.’s world, which 
puts her further and further out of touch 
with her own (and her sanity). His coaxing 
brings out a different, sinister side to her and, 
for a while at least, she embraces it. Though 
Veronica eventually gets a grip and, remembers 
that murder is wrong, she has to break away 
from J.D.’s control in order to do so.
We can compare these relationships to 
that of Holly and Kit from “Badlands,” the 
1973 Terrence Malick movie. Holly, the 
female protagonist in “Badlands,” goes on a 
murderous escapade across the country after 
the male lead, Kit, kills his girlfriend’s father. 
Kit is trigger-happy, killing without real 
motive and still somehow charming audiences 
both within and outside of the film. Similar 
to “Heathers,” “Badlands” paints an oddball, 
disturbing romance in which an attractive 
couple gets caught up in crazy, violent antics 
that yield disastrous results yet remain 
bizarrely romantic.
Though all three of the aforementioned 
films vary considerably, the common thread 
of idealized, unrealistic and perilous romance remains consistent. 
From Romeo’s impulsive murder of Tybalt, to J.D.’s obsession 
with eliminating Veronica’s friends, to Kit’s insensitivity towards 
violence in general, these depictions have lead me to believe that the 
idealization of destructive and twisted teenage “love” is something 
deeply ingrained in the culture of film.
Now comes the big question: Are films responsible for showing 
realistic exemplifications of “young love” instead of illustrating 
ridiculously unhealthy relationships? Or is there an artfulness 
and beauty to idealized, over-dramatized and often dangerous 
romantic depictions? Films have an undeniable power to shape our 
understanding not only of the world around us, but about ourselves as 
well. In the midst of a rising demand for more diverse, well-rounded 
and realistic roles for women in film, it is essential to consider the 
repercussions that films can have on a young girl’s confidence in 
her sexuality, awareness of herself worth and conception of what a 
healthy relationship looks like.
Perhaps the problem is not that films like “Twilight,” “Heathers” 
and “Badlands” present young, heavily female audiences with 
risqué, dark or destructive relationships, but rather that there is 
no dissection of these contentious themes in the films. Blindly 
romanticizing relationships filled with drama, instability and 
immorality will understandably confuse young viewers, taking away 
the message that something as serious as murder and suicide can be 
taken lightly if it is a labor of love.

Bad romance and teen nostaligia: A ‘Twilight’ deep dive 

FILM LONGFORM

TV REVIEW

It all starts with a robbery. A thief in all black 
swings down through the clouds on an umbrella, 
like a criminal Mary Poppins. The thief swings over 
the gates of the Glurfsburg Zoo, past a distracted 
security guard, past the various animals. Stopping 
in front of a cage, the thief comes face to face with 
a dark, growling mass. The alarms go off. Sounds 
of crashing. When the security 
investigates, the cage is busted 
wide open, the animal gone.
For those of us who grew 
up through the rhymes of the 
pseudonymous doctor, the story 
doesn’t sound like any Dr. Suess 
book we’ve ever read. His rhyming 
picture books have sustained 
through the cultural imagination 
since they came out in the ’50s and 
’60s. Every few years or so, we get 
yet another attempt to reinvent 
his books for the big screen, even 
though it never quite captures 
the original magic. Netflix’s new 
attempt at “Green Eggs and Ham” may be simple, but 
to its credit, it’s also interesting and fun.
The story this time around follows Guy-Am-I 
(Michael Douglas, “Wall Street”), a grumpy, failed 
inventor who turns out to be the only inventor not 
chosen to go to Meepville to present his invention. 
He also does not like green eggs and ham — not that 
he’s ever tried it. This is information given to Sam-
I-Am (Adam DeVine 
“Workaholics”), 
a 
happy-go-lucky 
inventor. 
It 
turns 
out 
the 
latter 
is 
also the thief from 
the 
beginning 
having 
stolen 
the 
Chickeraffe, 
a 
dangerous 
animal 
that the police now 
believe on the loose in the streets of Glurfsburg. 
Only it isn’t. It’s in Sam-I-Am’s briefcase. But when 
Sam and Guy accidentally swap briefcases at a diner, 
things get a little tricky.

One of the most remarkable things about this 
show is the cast and crew. Michael Douglas and 
Adam DeVine aren’t the only big names. Diane 
Keaton (“Annie Hall”) also voices a character known 
as Michellee, an overprotective mother of a very 
spunky daughter. Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) even 
voices a French mouse. However, the true star of the 
show is Keegan-Michael Key (“Key and Peele”), who 
voices the narrator. For all the show’s attempts at 
reinvention, Key’s confused, rhyming narrator is by 
far the best addition. Here, he’s both 
funny and charming, managing not 
to overwhelm the story, but keep it 
fresh and upbeat.
The original book is 72 pages in 
length, often with one, maybe two 
sentences on each page (usually 
concerning 
where 
one 
might 
eat green eggs and ham, with a 
bold refute). The fact that Netflix 
managed to turn the story into a 
13-episode series says a lot about just 
how much the streaming service 
added to its story. The inventor plot, 
thus far, seems to work well enough. 
It’s a very simple story but, then 
again, so is the original “Green Eggs and Ham,” so it’s 
hard to complain about that.
Something I particularly admire about this 
adaption is the animation. There have been a number 
of animated adaptations in the past twenty years, 
such as “The Lorax” or “Horton Hears a Who.” But 
Netflix’s “Green Eggs and Ham” appeals to the older, 
hand-drawn animated specials from the ’60s and 
’70s. There’s a kind 
of nostalgic charm 
in seeing such a fun, 
relaxed application of 
a very old animation 
style.
All 
in 
all, 
the 
original plot of “Green 
Eggs and Ham” works 
much the same way 
other Dr. Suess books 
have: It is a framework onto which larger, entertaining 
stories can be told. I can’t say it’s the most sophisticated 
show or even the best offering for younger audiences, 
but it does appeal to nostalgia. It may even be good.

I’ll try ‘Green Eggs & Ham’

Offense clicking behind Patterson

Ben McDaniels stood in front of 
the media Wednesday afternoon, 
detailing the texture that a football 
takes on in cold weather and the 
impact that has on ball security.
Midway 
through, 
the 
quarterbacks coach offered an 
apology, realizing that the minutiae 
of a football’s texture isn’t high on 
the list of storylines surrounding 
Michigan football three days 
before the Michigan State game. 
Inside Schembechler Hall, though, 
it’s a strange juxtaposition to the 
scene just a few weeks ago, when 
ball security was the unavoidable 
topic of the month.
That was back when Shea 
Patterson fumbled five times and 
lost four in the season’s first three 
games. Now, six games removed 
from his last lost fumble, it’s a 
forgotten topic from a departed 
part of Michigan’s season — back 
when its offense couldn’t get going, 
with Patterson as the primary 
culprit.
“Ball handling’s improved a 
ton,” Patterson said. “Struggled 
a little bit early to keep the ball 
off the ground, but that was a big 
emphasis over the last four, five 
weeks.”
The correlation isn’t lost on the 
Wolverines.
“Not getting ourselves into 

bad situations, third-and-longs 
(has helped the turnaround),” 
Patterson said. “Just taking care 
of the football, and I think the run 
game’s really helped that out. It’s 
opened up the pass game a little bit, 
and our guys are really getting into 
open space.”
Back then — when Michigan 
nearly got shut out in a loss to 
Wisconsin and then scored just 10 
points on Iowa two weeks later — 
the questions that encompassed 
the Wolverines’ offense were 
wholesale, with Patterson clearly 
hampered by a series of injuries.
What is this offense supposed to 
be? Why is it not utilizing its best 
weapons? Is Josh Gattis ready to be 
an offensive coordinator?
Four games, 146 points and 
three wins later, those questions 
are gone, largely replaced by 
conclusive answers.
This 
isn’t 
the 
Oklahoma-
esque spread offense that many 
envisioned when Gattis was hired, 
and Patterson isn’t a dark-horse 
Heisman candidate. But there’s a 
coherent identity and Patterson 
looks comfortable in the offense, 
mixing in elements of Gattis’ 
modern concepts with Michigan’s 
old offense.
Holding onto the football has 
been a large part of that, helping 
Gattis install his promised run-
pass option game.
“That’s a big part of our offense,” 

McDaniels said. “The mesh with 
the backs, giving it, pulling it, 
throwing it, it’s a huge part of the 
system. And (Patterson) does a 
good job of it.”
The biggest impact of Patterson’s 
improved ball security, though, 
can be found in the ground game. 
Amid his slew of early-season 
injuries, he was hesitant to keep 
the ball on quarterback reads or get 
out of the pocket on passing plays 
— moves he feels more comfortable 
making now.
Since the loss at Wisconsin, he’s 
picked up gains of 10-plus yards 
in all but two games, run for five 
touchdowns and helped get the 
Wolverines’ run game going by 
keeping defenses honest.
“Of course we know he can 
run and throw, so that’s an added 
benefit,” said senior guard Michael 
Onwenu. “If they bite down hard 
on a run, we can pull it. ... It makes 
defenses think twice.”
So now, two months after 
Patterson ran for negative yards 
in consecutive games, McDaniels 
doesn’t even have to talk about 
running with him. He’s trusted to 
make his own reads and get out 
of the pocket as he sees fit. “Every 
plan is built in a way that, for the 
right reasons, when he takes off, 
it’s a good thing for our offense,” 
McDaniels said.
And, most importantly, it doesn’t 
end with the ball on the turf.

Simpson stands out on pick-and-roll

It was a play Creighton had 
seen before. 
Jon 
Teske 
— 
with 
his 
imposing 7-foot-1, 265-pound 
frame — set a high-ball screen 
for Zavier Simpson, who, fully 
in control and dangling the 
basketball from his right hand 
as if it were a yo-yo, led his 
defender right into Teske’s 
torso. As Simpson peeled off, 
occupying two Bluejays in the 
process, the senior center dove 
towards the basket, eventually 
receiving a pinpoint bounce-
pass and converting an easy 
layup underneath. 
The sequence gave Michigan 
a seven-point cushion with just 
over five minutes remaining 
in the second half and was 
the fourth time the duo had 
connected directly off the pick-
and-roll, leading to a 79-69 win. 
Creighton 
saw 
that 
set 
countless times on Tuesday 
night — it just couldn’t stop it. 
“Simpson’s hard to control,” 
said 
Bluejays 
coach 
Greg 
McDermott. “He is who he is 
for a reason. He makes great 
decisions with the basketball 
and got us stretched out some. 
“Our bigs probably didn’t do a 
good enough job of stopping the 
basketball, and when we did, 
Simpson made the right read, 
either with the skip pass or 
finding Teske under the basket.” 
Simpson was his usual self 
against 
Creighton, 
dictating 
the Wolverines’ offense and 
attacking the basket when the 
opportunity presented itself. 
In addition to his nine assists 
— five of which went to Teske — 
the senior point guard tallied 17 
points. 
For much of the first half 
though, junior forward Isaiah 
Livers and junior guard Eli 
Brooks were the beneficiaries 
of Teske’s high-ball screens. 
Curling off and attacking the 
lane, Simpson found them for 
open looks from deep. 

But, as time went on, things 
opened up for Teske. Nearing 
halftime, Simpson found the 
rolling big man on consecutive 
possessions for two uncontested 
dunks. 
“He was just being more 
patient,” Teske said. “He wasn’t 
forcing things. When he’s in 
those ball screens, he can get 
downhill. He’s gonna find you if 
you’re open — either kick it out 
for threes or throw it up for a 
lob. He’s just very creative off of 
those ball screens.”
With 
Creighton 
hedging 
on the shooters more in the 
second half and lacking size 
in its frontcourt, the Simpson-
Teske pipeline was even more 
freeflowing. As a result, Teske 
scored 12 of his 17 in the final 20 
minutes. 
“Anytime we play a team like 
that, we want to use our height 
advantage,” Teske said. “In the 
first half, we were trying to, 
but sometimes it’s not going to 
really work. But (Simpson) did 
a great job of getting downhill 
and kicking it out for open 
threes. In the second half, that 
kinda opened it up for everyone 
downlow.”
While 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan Howard prefers his team 
push the ball up the floor in 
transition, in half-court sets, his 
offensive system is predicated 
on 
his 
guard’s 
playmaking 

ability coming off the high-ball 
screen. 
Against Appalachian State, 
Simpson struggled with this, 
especially in the second half. 
A 
proven 
ball-handler, 
he 
uncharacteristically 
turned 
the ball over six times — five of 
which came after halftime.
As Howard is quick to point 
out though, transitioning from 
John Beilein’s offense to his 
own will take some time, even 
for Simpson. 
“Well, it’s a new offense for 
him,” Howard said. “For all of 
us. There’s going to be some 
growing pains throughout the 
process. Hopefully, with the 
growing pains that there are, 
we get better. But I trust we 
will.”
The growing pains Simpson 
experienced 
against 
the 
Mountaineers 
were 
absent 
on Tuesday. With Simpson 
orchestrating the pick-and-roll 
to perfection, the Wolverines 
improved over the course of the 
game. 
And, the Bluejays had no 
answer for it. 
“He’s very crafty and smart,” 
Howard said. “Our bigs can do a 
better job of screening, which I 
will help them get better in that 
area by screening and screening 
angles, to allow Zavier to be 
able to get downhill, to make 
plays for himself, or for others.”

3-point shooting provides key for ‘M’

In both of its games so far, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team has attempted at least 
20 3-pointers — a statistic that 
occurred only one time all of last 
season.
The change in style is largely 
due to one player in particular: 
Naz Hillmon.
Against 
both 
Western 
Michigan and Bradley, Hillmon 
was the defense’s main focus. 
She often faced double and triple-
teams as opposing defenses dared 
other Michigan players to beat 
them from the perimeter. In both 
games, open 3-point opportunities 
were plentiful, and the Wolverines 
were willing to take what they 
were given. 
“We make sure we’re taking 
threes every day and getting 
up shots every day, because we 
know the attention that Naz is 
gonna face,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “If people 
are double-teaming the post, 
somebody else has gotta step in 
and make a play.”
Added junior forward Hailey 
Brown: “It definitely opens (the 
floor) up. If my player wants to go 
on double or help off, then that’s 
an easy kick out to me, or honestly 
with anybody.”
In 
Friday’s 
game, 
the 
Wolverines only went 5-for-20 
from 3-point range, but it was 

clearly a focus of their offense. 
On 
Sunday, 
this 
percentage 
improved. Michigan shot 11-for-23 
from beyond the arc, and two of 
its biggest runs were sparked by 
efficient 3-point shooting.
Rather than forcing the ball 
into the paint and taking contested 
shots or risking turnovers with 
Hillmon 
drawing 
in 
bodies, 
the 
Wolverines 
took 
these 
open 3-pointers and didn’t lose 
confidence in themselves when 
they weren’t falling. Freshman 
guard Michelle Sidor — who has 
received praise from both her 
teammates and Barnes Arico on 
her ability to score off the bounce 
— attempted 16 shots in the two 
games, 11 of which were from 
deep.
“Obviously I can shoot ... but I 
can definitely drive too and score 
in a lot of different ways,” Sidor 
said. “I didn’t display that a lot this 
weekend because I was mostly just 
coming off screens and shooting.” 
 
These 3-pointers didn’t just 
come 
from 
Michigan’s 
top 
shooters such as Sidor. Over 
the 
weekend, 
nine 
different 
Wolverines made a 3-point shot, 
including every forward on the 
roster except Hillmon. The ability 
of the Michigan’s bigs to knock 
down these shots, in turn, opens 
up the paint more, forcing defenses 
to cover the perimeter.
“I think it’s great when you 
have a great compliment to Naz 
in another post player that can 

face-up and knock down threes, 
and our three other post players 
are really good at that,” Barnes 
Arico said. “So we just gotta have 
the confidence, if Naz is being 
doubled, to make those shots and 
take those shots.”
It was no coincidence that 
Hillmon registered a double-
double on Sunday. With Michigan 
shooting more effectively, the 
opposing defense had to shift some 
of their focus away from Hillmon 
and towards its shooters.
“It opens up the floor a lot,” 
Hillmon said. “You have to close 
out to those 3-point shooters, and 
it opens up the lane so much for me 
to get long or short rebounds, so 
having great shooters on my team 
… helps me a lot.”
Despite streaky shooting, the 
Wolverines decidedly won their 
first two games because of their 
ability to catch fire at any time. As 
the competition gets better, it will 
be crucial for them to consistently 
make open 3-pointers to force 
teams to stop packing the paint 
against Hillmon, allowing her 
to be as dominant as she was last 
season.
“If we’re able to knock down 
shots it’ll become a lot more easier 
for her to get her quick scores and 
stuff like that in the paint,” Brown 
said. “Just being able to … shoot 
from the outside forces defenses 
to kind of pick and choose how 
they want to defend and what they 
want to take away.”

For Michigan hockey, this weekend 
is about more than Michigan State

Michael Pastujov smirked.
“I mean, it’s (Michigan) State 
week,” he said. “Everybody’s 
pretty fired up. Everybody’s 
ready.”
When 
asked 
about 
the 
upcoming 
weekend 
series, 
the junior forward’s response 
was direct and to the point. 
Everyone 
was 
onboard. 
Everyone was buying into the 
vision.
Just like Pastujov’s answer, 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson’s 
message to the team this week 
sung the same tune. 
Pearson 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
taking 
the 
schedule one game at a time and 
stressed that the Wolverines’ 
season wasn’t in danger of 
needing to be turned around. 
It’s still early in the season, 
and the Michigan hockey team 
is building the foundation of its 
play style.
“It’s 
obviously 
very 
important,” Pearson said. “You 
can’t keep giving points away 
if we’d like to finish as high as 
we want to. Especially home 
games.”
And there are certainly areas 
where the team could stand to 
improve.
In the last two weeks 12 
conference points have been 
within Michigan’s grasp. It’s 
only managed to eke one point 
out from its last four games — 
good enough for second-to-last 

place in the conference.
It’s no secret that as of late, 
the Wolverines’ offense has 
been struggling considerably. 
Through its last five games, 
Michigan has found the back of 
the net just seven times.
Despite 
these 
setbacks, 
Pearson preached a message of 
positivity to his team this week 
during practice.
“The mood has been good,” 
Pearson said. “The intensity 
has 
been 
really 
good 
in 
practice, which is a positive. 
There’s so many games left, so 
it’s not like football where if 
you lose one game, it can really 
sidetrack you. You have to stay 
upbeat and positive and really 
trust in the players around 
you.”
The Wolverines’ absence on 
the scoresheet is not the only 
thing that’s provided fuel in 
the team’s preparation for the 
upcoming games against the 
Spartans — there’s an almost-
century long rivalry, too.
For 
players 
like 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
— 
someone 
who’s 
been 
a 
Michigan fan his entire life — 
the history between the two 
schools is long and grinding. 
On the other side of the 
spectrum are Wolverines like 
Pastujov, born and raised in 
Florida, completely unaware of 
the vying teams.
“Until I got here, I didn’t 
really think about it much,” 
Pastujov 
said. 
“Then 
once 
you get here, you learn the 

history of it. What it means 
to everybody here and what it 
means to the fans. It’s hard not 
to get pretty deep into it.”
In Pastujov’s freshman year 
when Michigan State came to 
play at Yost, Michigan blanked 
the Spartans, 4-0. Then — 
the next day — it lost, 5-0, at 
Munn Ice Arena. Every year, 
no matter how either team is 
fareing, the series is either 
school’s for the taking. 
With the Wolverines having 
only one conference point, 
there’s a lot at stake this 
weekend.
“At the end of the day it’s all 
about Big Ten play,” Pastujov 
said. “And right now, we’re on 
a four-game skid in Big Ten. 
There’s going to be six huge 
points this week. I guess that’s 
priority one, but the rivalry, it’s 
definitely still in our heads.”
The energy boost provided 
by such a big rivalry is exactly 
what Michigan needs. Yes, it’s 
still early in the season. And 
yes, its last five games have 
been close, but if this team 
wants to achieve the goals it set, 
there has to be a momentum 
swing at some point. 
Beyond 
fierce 
competitiveness, 
this 
series 
offers players who’ve been 
struggling — like sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert — a 
shot at redemption.
Twice last Friday, Lambert 
had the game on his stick 
and failed to convert. The 
frustration was written all 
over his face and mirrored on 
his teammates’, too.
This weekend, he has the 
chance to prove his talent, and 
maybe provide the spark the 
Wolverines’ offense has been 
desperately searching for the 
past five games.
Because, yes, it’s rivalry 
weekend. But for a team still 
trying to find its footing in 
the Big Ten, it’s about so much 
more than history.
“You don’t come to Michigan 
just to play in big games,” 
Lambert said. “You come to 
win in big games.”

D

ear Only News Source in 
Ann Arbor,
To be honest, I’m 
impressed. 
Finding 
time to go 
to class, 
prepare for 
a football 
game and 
bike to city 
hall meet-
ings in the 
rain — all 
while bal-
ancing being 
one of four (four!) city gov-
ernment reporters — must be 
exhausting. 
The thought of carrying one 
whole fourth of really any beat 
while attending the prestigious 
University of Michigan — wow. 
They should write stories about 
people like you in The New 
York Times.
It’s not just your city govern-
ment reporters I would want to 
single out, though. Unless you 
were, well, craving the atten-
tion of being singled out by 
being featured in the Times.
It’s also this quote — which I 
had to re-read twice — because 
I couldn’t believe it wasn’t said 
in jest, even by someone at your 
notoriously humble university.
“We’ve been given this 
mantle of holding the powerful 

accountable, five nights a week, 
with no department backing us 
up,” your managing editor said. 
When it comes to the rivalry 
between The Daily and The 
State News, you might want 
to pipe down about holding 
the powerful accountable. 
That’s kind of our thing. That’s 
why we win Pacemakers. And 
unlike the one in Schembechler 
Hall, our trophy case is full of 
awards from this century.
What department, by the 
way, do you speak of? Are you 
referring to the fact that your 
university, with its 200 years 
of history and presidential 
alumni, still doesn’t have a 
journalism school? Your uni-
versity cured polio, so ask them 
to invest in its journalists!
We don’t have a department 
backing us up, either. The State 
News is wholly independent, 
both from our university and 
our journalism school. We 
“carry that mantle” also, and 
we do it without histrionic, 
self-important quotes.
I wonder how you get by 
with just a $4.5 million endow-
ment and a staff of more than 
250 students.
According to the Times arti-
cle, you only elected your most 
recent editor-in-chief after she 
was able to successfully name 
the 11 members of city hall, 

along with their wards and 
party affiliations. I assume she 
was one of 17 or 18 people cov-
ering the city the year before, 
but maybe not. 
That is not a test to see if 
someone is fit to lead. That’s 
the kind of pointless memo-
rization I had to do when I 
joined a fraternity. 
So, now we come to the 
football game. A touch football 
game played to prove, well, 
what exactly? I couldn’t tell 
you. 
That your staff of 250 has 
better athletes than our staff 
of 40? 
It’s like a school from the 
Football Bowl Subdivision los-
ing to a team from the Football 
Championship Subdivision — 
there’s a difference in scholar-
ship count. 
You guys are the favorites 
this year, looking for your 15th 
straight win in this very impor-
tant, not at all farcical, game. 
But The State News could 
win. Crazier things have hap-
pened, like a Michigan team 
under Jim Harbaugh winning 
an important game on the road, 
or a Michigan alumnus going 
through one whole dinner 
party without mentioning their 
degree. It happens once in a 
blue moon.
And, besides, no team repre-
senting the University of Mich-
igan has ever lost a football 
game when they had a substan-
tial advantage in the number of 
participating athletes.
So, with that, I will wish 
you good luck Friday night. I’ll 
wish good luck to the real team 
representing your university 
with actual athletes on Satur-
day afternoon, too. 
I’ll be there. So will your 
14 football reporters. In all 
seriousness, in this day and 
age, where journalists from 
all schools are under attack, 
I think it’s important that we 
stick together. We’re all trying 
to do the same thing — keep 
the public informed.
Some of us just recognize 
that other people do it, too.

L

ast week, our editor-in-
chief, Maya Goldman, and I 
received an email from The 
State News 
asking if we 
could play 
our annual 
touch football 
game — which 
has never let a 
little weather 
change things 
before — 
inside this 
year. 
Forgetting 
for a second the fact that this is 
newspaper football and nobody 
has the time nor the means to rent 
a damn dome, that actually sums 
up the current state of this news-
paper rivalry quite well: one side 
humming along, business as usual, 
the other desperately looking for 
any excuse to feel slighted.
Every year, their quips in this 
column take on a similar tone. This 
year, as with most, they will fall 
remarkably flat.
The State News will claim to 
not care about the annual touch 
football game, which I suppose is 
the correct stance for a group that 
had recently graduated diapers the 
last time their team won. They’ll 
show up to chant expletives at us 
anyway, take their 15th-straight 
loss and drive back to East Lansing 
assured that next year is the year.
They’ll lament our large staff, 
because offering opportunities 
to eager, young journalists is, 
of course, a bad thing. Awfully 
rich coming from the paper that, 
as of the publication of this col-
umn, hasn’t covered its school’s 
women’s soccer team in 26 days, 
its volleyball team in 13 days and 
its field hockey team team in 78 
days. They’ve written two stories 
all year — one of which was a 398-
word Big Ten title game story — 
about the women’s cross country 
team, which is the most successful 
team at the entire school.
You might want to grab any 
riffraff off the street to help you 
out there.
Maybe, in a fit of desperation, 
The State News will turn to the 
Michigan State football team’s on-
field product, which seems, uh … 
off the table this year. It’s always 
been weird when your writers 
have gone that direction in the 
past, considering you’re supposed 
to be objective, but I suppose it’s 

particularly hard to do this year 
when the Spartans are a living, 
breathing embodiment of the “this 
is fine” GIF. 
They’ll hold up their J-School 
as if it somehow portends a better 
newspaper, which is easily dis-
pelled by, I don’t know, a cursory 
scroll through statenews.com.
Sometimes they’ll stress their 
collection of awards, which seems 
like the wrong course of action in a 
year we won the award for the best 
college sports section in the coun-
try — not to mention best gamer, 
best columnist and best front page.
One year, they even drew a 
little Spartans/Persians metaphor 
that made for quite the read. One 
excerpt:
“Mark Dantonio is King Leoni-
das, and has been for his Spartans 
since his arrival to the throne 
of head coach in East Lansing. 
A great leader — the men he has 
recruited were not the best ath-
letes, nor the greatest students, 
but dedication to his process of 
intense, hard-nosed training and 
conditioning has led him to glory 
no Spartan coach in the modern 
era of MSU football has achieved. 
‘Those who have stayed are 
already champions.’ ”
Nailed it. Just a couple thoughts:
1) Be more of a homer. I dare 
you.
2) Help me brush up on some 
history — was King Leonidas also 

forced out of his role after blowing 
a 25-point lead at home to Lovie 
Smith?
In reality, I harbor no disdain 
for Michigan State. I’m not from 
Michigan. I did not apply to Michi-
gan State. I’m sure it’s a fine school, 
and I’m sure you’re all totally, 
completely, entirely pleased you’re 
there and not here. I’m sure you’re 
all good people, and I’d love to grab 
a meal or beer after we make it 15 
on Friday.
You can have your robotic 
J-School ledes, I’ll take our creativ-
ity. You can have your haphazard 
profiles, I’ll take our deeply-report-
ed features. You can have your 
professors, I’ll take the best alumni 
base out there. You can have your 
smaller staff (weird flex), I’ll take 
the best college sports section in 
the goddamn country.
So, by all means, rehash the 
same flimsy insults this year; 
there’s not a single leg to stand on. 
We’ll just be over here beating you 
on the field, off the field, in the 
classroom, in the newsroom and 
just about everywhere in between.
Hopefully you can find some 
dignity in that defeat.

Michigan preparing for cold weather

As the Michigan football team 
practiced outdoors in single-
digit windchills this week, snow 
and ice still on the ground, Chris 
Partridge didn’t hear a single 
complaint.
But the safeties and special 
teams coach couldn’t help but 
notice that he hadn’t quite dressed 
for the weather.
“I don’t understand (when 
coaches wear shorts),” he said. “I 
don’t want to freeze. I want to have 
clothes on when I’m coaching.”
In bad weather, Partridge has 
to worry more than most other 
coaches — not just because of 
his apparel choices, but because 
special teams plays like kicks and 
punts are affected more by the 
weather than others. Rain, snow 
and cold all make kicks harder 
due to reduced aerodynamics, and 
wet conditions make returns more 
difficult without fumbling.
The 
Wolverines’ 
coaches 
have always embraced whatever 
weather may come and hope their 
players follow their lead. This is 
Michigan, after all. And Saturday 
— when the Wolverines suit up 
against Michigan State with a 
forecasted high temperature of 31 
degrees — it won’t be their first 
brush with bad weather.
Michigan took the field before 
a tilt with Notre Dame on Oct. 
26, 
wearing 
blue 
warm-up 
jackets. Some coupled that with 
white gloves or long socks to 
shield from the rain and mid-40s 
temperatures.
For that game, the Wolverines 
were more pumped up than usual. 
“That’s our best warmup we’ve 
ever seen,” Partridge said.
In 
the 
end, 
Michigan 
game-planned 
perfectly 
for 
the conditions, sticking to an 
aggressive rushing attack until 
the rain slowed and ultimately 

running all over the Fighting Irish.
But this week, the team will 
face a different sort of weather 
challenge in the bitter cold. While 
Ann Arbor isn’t exactly known 
for balmy weather in November, 
most games are at least in the 40s. 
You’d have to go back six years, to 
a game against Iowa at Kinnick 
Stadium in 2013, to find a game 
that kicked off with temperatures 
below freezing.
To 
make 
matters 
worse, 
Monday blanketed Ann Arbor in 
nearly a foot of snow — and not 
all of it is expected to melt before 
Saturday. So, to be ready for 
anything come the weekend, the 
Wolverines have been switching 
off between indoor and outdoor 
practice.
“Coach (Jim Harbaugh) does 
a really good job of going in and 
out and being outside,” Partridge 
said. “It was great yesterday, I 
don’t think it sucks. I mean, we’re 
in Michigan, we’re not gonna say, 
‘Oh, it’s gonna be warm,’ we’re 
gonna go out and we’re gonna 
deal with it, and I think that’s 
important for the players, too.
“It’s like, ‘OK, well, it’s cold 
out, so we’re gonna stay inside 
the whole time?’ No. You play in 
Michigan. This is what it is. So you 
go out there and enjoy it. I didn’t 
hear one complaint.”
According 
to 
quarterbacks 
coach 
Ben 
McDaniels, 
cold 
temperatures, and even snow, 
don’t affect game plans as much 
as rain. Wet weather causes the 
ball to become slippery, which 
can cause problems in the passing 
game and with ball security, so 
safe running plays — like what 
the Wolverines ran against Notre 
Dame — are the best bet. As part of 
pregame preparation, the coaches 
check the forecasts, cross their 
fingers that they’re accurate, then 
adjust on the fly if needed.
There’s no snow in the forecast 
Saturday, at least not for now. But 

cold weather can still change the 
feel of the ball, so it’s important 
to get reps in for all kinds of 
conditions.
“My experience is, cold is 
cold, so it’s gotta get pretty darn 
cold to factor in, in my opinion,” 
McDaniels said. “Some guys wear 
gloves, some don’t, that’s a topic of 
discussion for quarterbacks. But 
my experience coaching guys and 
some playing experience, once you 
get running around, you’re pretty 
comfortable and you get used to 
being in the environment and 
those frigid, frigid temperatures 
might affect, at some point, your 
ability to hold a ball. The feel of the 
ball is different as it gets colder, 
but we should be in great shape for 
this weekend.”
McDaniels 
was 
careful 
to 
note that cold weather didn’t 
necessarily mean ball security 
was harder, just that the texture 
of the ball could be different and 
quarterbacks 
need 
to 
adjust. 
Senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
is one signal-caller who does wear 
gloves in low temperatures. He’s 
done it ever since he was a little kid 
when the thermometer dropped 
below 30.
Harbaugh is a perfect poster 
child for Michigan’s weather 
mentality. Look at him, and it 
might as well be 70 degrees and 
sunny. When Harbaugh and the 
other coaches adopt that attitude, 
the players follow suit. If the 
Wolverines have their way, they’ll 
play like they don’t even notice the 
temperature.
“That’s really Jim’s personality, 
right?” Partridge said. “He can 
walk outside and everyone else is 
like, ‘Damn, it’s pouring out,’ and 
he’ll be coaching his butt off, not 
even noticing it’s raining.
“You’re like, ‘Does this guy 
even 
know 
it’s 
raining 
and 
freezing?’ But the team gains that 
personality. The coaches, that’s 
who they become.”
