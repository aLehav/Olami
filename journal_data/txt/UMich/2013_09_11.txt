Doctoral student
dies over weekend
from undiagnosed
neurological issues
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
A memorial service will be
held Wednesday for Courtney
Wilson, a doctoral student in the
School of Natural Resources and
Environment, who died Mon-
day after a series of neurological
problems over the weekend.
SNRE faculty and students
will gather in the Dana Build-
ing's Ford Commons to reflect
upon and celebrate Wilson's life
between noon and 1 p.m.
Wilson, who completed her
master's degree at SNRE, had

been studying the use of satellite
images to analyze paved surfaces
in Southeast Michigan. She was
one of six students in her class of
Ph.D. students.
In an interview Tuesday,
SNRE dean Marie Lynn Miranda
said Wilson had a joyful spirit,
an incredible work ethic and was
especially interested in the ways
human activity affects lands and
ecosystems.
In an e-mail sent to SNRE
faculty and students Tuesday,
Miranda noted Wilson, "not sur-
prisingly," was an organ donor.
Honoring her dedication to the
life sciences, Wilson's parents
have agreed to an autopsy that
they hope will advance medical
knowledge since Wilson's condi-
tion occurred suddenly and has
yet to be diagnosed.

The Ross School of Business

program for students without

a business background.
The 10-month Master of

cation is closed to graduates
with a business degree, aimed
instead at students in fields
such as engineering or the

Program officials cite an
ever-growing demand for a

diverse set of skills and the
importance of business as a
global factor as the impetus
behind the program.
"It would be applicable, I

DEMAND STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON BOARD OF REGENTS
Students work to pass amnesty bill

I LUNGING AAOUND

Two University of Wis-
consin-Madison students
are pushing to pass bills in
the Wisconsin state Assem-
bly and Senate, The Daily
Cardinal reported Monday.
The students, Morgan
Rae, Associated Students of
Madison legislative-affairs
chair, and Kaitlyn Novotny,
ASM vice chair, initiated
the Responsible Action bill
and the Student Regentbill,
respectively.
The Responsible Action
bill aims to create medi-
cal-amnesty legislation in
cases of underage drink-
ing that lessen penalties
for intoxicated minors who

seek medical attention,
while the Student Regent
bill looks to add two stu-
dent representatives on
that university's Board of
Regents.
Rae and Novotny tried to
push the bills this summer,
but have encountered set-
backs in working with state
legislators.

SFederal officials to 'crush'
six tons of ivory in October

EVAN VUCc
President Barack Obama addresses the nation in alive televised speech from the East Room of the White House.
Obama delays Syria vote,
rempains 'ready to respond'

U.S. seeks to
eliminate $10-
billion illegal
industry
DENVER (AP) - Federal
wildlife officials plan to crush
more than 6 tons of ivory in
Denver as part of a new push
by the United States to com-
bat illegal wildlife trafficking
worldwide.
The ivory that is beingstored
in a warehouse near Denver
was seized around the country
in an effort to block imports
of tusks from elephants that
have been slaughtered for their
ivory. -
The seized items include
large balls of ivory delicately
carved in layers and whole
tusks that have been sculpted
into pagodas and scenes from
daily life.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service said publicly crush-
ing the expensive smuggled
tusks and carvings is part of
an effort to put an end to what
has become a $10 billion illegal
industry. Steve Oberholtzer,
the agency's Denver-based spe-
cial agent in charge, is lining up
rock-grinders to pulverize the
ivory in October.
Governments cooperating
with the efforts to stem the

slaughter of elephants already
have destroyed some of the
ivory seized from poachers,
U.S. Interior Secretary Sally
Jewell said Monday at a White
House forum where the initia-
tive was launched.
"The U.S. supports these
actions, and we want to make
sure we are doing the same,"
Jewell said.
President Barack Obama
issued an order July 1 to fight
the killing of protected wild-
life, stop the trafficking, and
reduce demand for illegal rhino
horns and ivory. Members of a
newly created advisory council
sketched a broad approach of
enlisting governments, compa-
nies and nonprofits worldwide,
the Denver Post reported Tues-
day (http://tinyurl.com/pzm-
cz9g).
U.S. officials said they will.
also give $10 million to help
fight poaching in Africa and
will try to persuade Asian gov-
ernments to outlaw trinkets
and other products made from
elephant ivory.
Tactics being considered
include using technology to
monitor elephants, a social
media campaign in China to
stigmatize the industry, and
cooperation with companies
such as eBayto curb commerce.
The National Wildlife Prop-
erty Repository at the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal National

Wildlife Refuge in Colorado
holds smuggled wildlife parts
seized atseaports,border cross-
ings and airports nationwide.
Other items seized include
leopard and tiger heads, bear
claws and crocodile boots.
Much of the ivory no longer
fits on shelves. Piles of tusks
and boxes full of bracelets and
decorations clutter the floor.
Forklifts are used to clear path-
ways between heavy pallets of
the plunder.
Some tusks are from young
elephants, representing gen-
erations lost because elephants
cannot reproduce until age 25,
and poachers usually kill ele-
phants before sawing off their
tusks.
U.S. authorities are prohibit-
ed from selling seized items but
have debated whether destroy-
ing them is the best approach.
Ivory selloffs in 2008 and 2010
supported by the 178-nation
Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Flora and Fauna proved
controversial.
Even if U.S. officials could
sell seized ivory, some say it
would not makea dent in illegal
market demand.
Grinding up all ivory in
October "will make more room
in our warehouse," repository
supervisor Bernadette Atencio
said, but she fears it will fill
again soon.

Pres. says Assad
threatens national
security, violates
international law
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama said in a
nationally televised address
Tuesday night that recent diplo-
matic steps offer "the potential
to remove the threat of chemi-
cal weapons" inside Syria with-
out the use of force, but he also
insisted the U.S. military will
keep the pressure on President
Bashar Assad "and be ready to
respond" if other measures fail.
Speaking from the East Room
of the White House, Obama
said he had asked congressional'
leaders to postpone a vote on
legislation he has been seeking
to authorize the use of military
force against Syria.
Acknowledging the weariness
the nation feels after a decade
of war in Iraq and Afghanistan,
Obama said, "America is not the
world's policeman."
And yet, he added, "When
with modest effort and risk we
can stop children from being
gassed to death and thereby
make our own children safer
over the long run, I believe we

should act. That's what makes
America different. That's what
makes us exceptional."
"Our ideals and principles, as
well as our national security, are
at stake in Syria," he declared.
The speech capped a frenzied
10-day stretch of events that
began when he unexpectedly
announced he was stepping back
from a threatened military strike
and first asking Congress to pass
legislation authorizing the use of
force against Assad.
With public opinion polls con-
sistently showing widespread
opposition to American military
intervention, the White House
has struggled mightily to gener-
ate support among lawmakers
- liberal Democrats and conser-
vative Republicans alike - who
have expressed fears of involve-
ment in yet another war in the
Middle East and have questioned
whether U.S. national security
interests were at stake in Syria.
Obama had trouble, as well,
building international support
for a military attack designed to
degrade Assad's military.
Suddenly, though, events took
another unexpected turn this
week. First Russia and then Syria
reacted positively to a seemingly
off-hand remark from Secretary
of State John Kerry indicating
that the crisis could be defused

if Damascus agreed to put its
chemical weapons under inter-
national control.
The president said he was
sending Secretary of State John
Kerry to meet with Russian For-
eign Minister Sergey Lavrov on
Thursday, and he added, "I will
continue my own discussion"
with Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
At the same time, he said the
United States and its allies would
work with Russia and China
to present a resolution to the
United Nations Security Council
"requiring Assad to give up his
chemical weapons and to ulti-
mately destroy them under inter-
national control."
In a speech that lasted 16
minutes, Obama recounted the
events of the deadly chemical
weapons attack on Aug. 21 that
the United States blames on
Assad.
"When dictators commit
atrocities, they depend upon the
world to look the other way until
these horrifying pictures fade
from memory. But these things
happened. The facts cannot be
denied," he said.
The president said firmly that
Assad's alleged attack was "not
only a violation of international
law, it's also a danger to our secu-
rity."

sells another
$811 million in
GM stock
The government is getting
closer to selling all of its General
Motors Co. stock.
The Treasury Department said
in its August report to Congress
that it sold $811 million worth of
GM common stock last month.
The report dated Tuesday says
the government has recovered
about $35.4 billion of the $49.5 bil-
lion bailout it gave the Detroit auto-
maker. That means taxpayers are
still $14.1billion in the hole.
The Treasury says the price
per share of stock sold in July and
August will be revealed at a later
date.

Richest 1 percent B

since 1920
The gulf between the richest 1
percent and the rest of America is
the widest it's been since the Roar-
ing'20s.
The very wealthiest Americans
earned more than 19 percent of the
country's household income last
year - their biggest share since
1928, the year before the stock mar-
ket crash. And the top 10 percent
captured a record 48.2 percent of
total earnings last year.
U.S. income inequality has been
growing for almost three decades.
And it grew again last year, accord-
ing to an analysis of Internal Rev-
enue Service figures dating to 1913
by economists at the University
of California, Berkeley, the Paris
School of Economics and Oxford
University.
Oneofthem,Berkeley'sEmman-
uel Saez, said the incomes of the
richest Americans surged last
year in part because they cashed
in stock holdings to avoid higher
capital gains taxes that took effect
in January.

ons attack and calling for a strong
international response.
The additions announced Tues-
day bring the total number of sup-
portive countries to 33, up from 25
on Monday.
The statement was released last
week at the close of an economic
summit in Russia. It had 11 origi-
nal signers, including the United
States. The latest countries to sign
are Georgia, Guatemala, Kuwait,
Malta, Montenegro, Panama,
Poland and Portugal.

* Congo, M23 talks
The Congolese government and
a rebel group that is ensconced in

in talks organized by neighboring

issued Tuesday.
"Significant progress has been
made in the dialogue," said the
statement from the office of the
Facilitator of the International
Conference of the Great Lakes,
which is hosting the mediation
effort in the capital of neighboring
Uganda.
Late last month, Congolese
troops exchanged heavy fire with
the M23 rebels, who occupy posi-
tions just outside the strategic east-

rvices is one that "we who engage in transactions
o deal with" and that involving the proceeds of such

activity may also be in viola-
tion of federal money launder-
ing statutes and other federal
financing laws."
Leahy, who spent eight years
as a prosecutor early in his
career, said the Justice Depart-
ment should focus on prosecut-
ing violent crime and should
respect the votes in Colorado
and Washington to legalize
small amounts of marijuana for
personal and medical use.
Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley,
the committee's top Republican
and co-chairman of the Senate
Caucus on International Nar-
cotics Control, said the Jus-
tice Department is "giving the
green light" to an industry bent
on breaking federal law.
Grassley said that Colora-
do has seen a sharp uptick in
diversion of marijuana from
Colorado to other states and
increased use among minors.
"I understand the skepti-
cism that you come to it with,"
Cole told Grassley. "We have
reserved, quite explicitly, the
right to go in" and challenge the
regulatory programs of Colora-
do and Washington.
Grassley asked what the
Justice Department plans to
do to protect states like Iowa
from marijuana being diverted
from states like Colorado. Cole
responded, "If it's being export-
ed from Colorado to Iowa and
we find out about it, we will
prosecute."
With the door to legalization
open in two states, others could
follow.

In some parts of
region, offenders felt
'sexual entitlement'
LONDON (AP) - About one
in four men in some parts of Asia
admittedrapingawoman, accord-
ingto the firstlarge studies ofrape
and sexual violence. About one in
10 admitted raping a woman who
was not their partner.
International researchers said
their startling finding should
change perceptions about how
common violence against women
is and prompt major campaigns
to prevent it. Still, the results
were based on a surveyof only six
Asian countries and the authors
said it was uncertain what rates
were like elsewhere in the region
and beyond. They said engrained
sexist attitudes contributed, but
that other factors like poverty or
being emotionally and physically
abused as children were major
risk factors for men's violent
behavior.
A previous report from the
World Health Organization
found one-third of women world-
wide say they have been victims
of domestic or sexual violence.
"It's clear violence against
women is far more widespread in
the general population than we
thought," said Rachel Jewkes of
South Africa's Medical Research
Council, who led the two stud-
ies. The research was paid for by
several United Nations agencies
and Australia, Britain, Norway
and Sweden. The papers were
published online Tuesday in the
journal, Lancet Global Health.
In the new research, male
interviewers surveyed more
than 10,000 men in Bangladesh,
China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka and Papua New Guinea.
The word "rape" was not used in
the questions, but the men were
asked if they had ever forced a
woman to have sex when she
wasn't willing or if they had ever

forced sex on someone who was
too drunk or drugged to consent.
In most places, scientists con-
cluded between 6 to 8 percent of
men raped a woman who wasn't
their partner. When they includ-
ed wives and girlfriends, the
figures were mostly between 30
to 57 percent. The lowest rates
were in Bangladesh and Indone-
sia and the highest were in Papa
New Guinea. Previous studies
of rape have been done in South
Africa, where nearly 40 percent
of men are believed to have raped
a woman.
Of those who acknowledged
forcing a woman to have sex,
more than 70 percent of men said
it was because of "sexual entitle-
ment." Nearly 60 percent said
they were bored or wanted to
have fun while about 40 percent
said it was because they were
angry or wanted to punish the
woman. Only about half of the
men said they felt guilty and 23
percent had been imprisoned for
a rape.
"The problem is shocking but
anyplace we have looked, we
see partner violence, victimiza-
tion and sexual violence," said
Michele Decker, an assistant pro-
fessor at Johns Hopkins Bloom-
berg School of Public Health,
who co-wrote an accompanying
commentary. "Rape doesn't just
involve someone with a gun to a
woman's head," she said. "People
tend to think of rape as some-
thing someone else would do."
"It's not enough to focus on
services for women," said Char-
lotte Watts, head of the Gender,
Violence and Health Centre at
the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, who was
not part of the study. She said
some programs in Africa based
on challenging traditional ideas
of masculinity are proving suc-
cessful.
"It may be that the culture
where they grew up condones
violence, but it's not impossible to
change that," she said.

Google loses federal appeals
case for invading online privacy

Data collected
through unprotected
networks ruled
as 'Wi-Spy'
SAN JOSE, Calif (AP) - A
federal appeals court said Google
wrongly collected people's per-
sonal correspondence and online
activities through their Wi-Fi
systems as it drove down their
streets with car cameras shoot-
ing photos for its Street View
mapping project.
The ruling that the practice
violates wiretap laws sends a
warning to other- companies
seeking to suck up vast amounts
of data from unencrypted Wi-Fi
signals.
"The payload data transmit-
ted over unencrypted Wi-Fi
networks that was captured by
Google included emails, user-
names, passwords, images, and
documents," wrote the U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francis-
co in a report released Tuesday
Google had argued that their
activities were exempt from the
wiretap law because data trans-
mitted over a Wi-Fi network is
a "radio communication" and is
"readily accessible to the public."
Not so, wrote the judges,
agreeing with an earlier federal
judge's ruling.
"Even if it is commonplace for
members of the general public
to connect to a neighbor's unen-
crypted Wi-Fi network, mem-
bers of the general public do not
typically mistakenly intercept,
store, and decode data transmit-
ted by other devices on the net-
work," they said.

Google's Street View cars can
be spotted with pole mounted
cameras on their roofs, photo-
graphing along roadways the
world over.The photosthenshow
up on Google's popular Street
View map option, where viewers
can virtually scroll along a street
past homes, cars and shops, all
captured in photographs.
But unbeknownst to passers-
by, those cameras weren't just
making photos. They were also
collecting detailed information
transmittedover Wi-Finetworks
they passed through.
- Privacy experts and industry
watchers said this was the first
time an appeals court has ruled
that it's illegal for a company
to sniff out and collect private
information from the Wi-Fi net-
works that provide Internet ser-
vice to people at home. Google
is also the first publically known
company to try.
"This appeals court decision
is a tremendous victory for pri-
vacy rights. It means Google
can't suck up private commu-
nications from people's Wi-Fi
networks and claim their Wi-
Spying was exempt from fed-
eral wiretap laws," said John
M. Simpson, Consumer Watch-
dog's privacy project director.
"Because Google's Wi-Spy activ-
ity was so extensive, the poten-
tial damages could amount to
billions of dollars."
Marc Rotenberg, executive
director of Electronic Privacy
Information Center, called it "a
landmark decision for Internet
privacy."
"The court made clear that
the federal privacy law applies to
residential Wi-Fi networks," he
said. "Users should be protected

when a company tries to capture
data that travels between their
laptop and their printer in their
home."
A Google spokesperson said
Tuesday that attorneys for the
Internet giant are "disappointed
in the 9th Circuit's decision and
are considering our next steps."
Attorney Elizabeth Cabraser,
representing a class action of
plaintiffs who say their privacy
was invaded by Google said
Tuesday they look forward to
resuming their case now that a
federal appeals court has ruled
in their favor.
Google has apologized for
the snooping, which it says took
place between 2008 and March
2010. It promised to stop collect-
ing the data and said the practice,
conducted in more than 30 coun-
tries, was inadvertent but not
illegal.
Earlier this year Google set-
tled a 37-state lawsuit for $7
million after attorney generals
sued over what they said was an
invasion of privacy for the data
collection.
The practice was discovered
by a German data protection
commissioner in 2010. A few
months later, Google co-found-
er Sergey Brin told conference
goers the firm had made a mis-
take.
"In short, let me just say that
we screwed up," he said at the
time.
Google says it has disabled
the equipment that was col-
lecting the data, and agreed
to destroy the information as
soon as possible. The company
is currently obliged to hold it,
unused, because of ongoingliti-
gation.

Drone to act as
diagnostic tool
on fields
EAST LANSING (AP) - A
drone has joined the vehicle
fleet at Michigan State Univer-
sity, which is using the pilotless
airplane to find ways to help
farmers increase their yields
through better use of fertilizer
and water.
The National Science
Foundation is financing the
research.
The East Lansing school says
the information that the drone
gathers also will help reduce the
environmental effect of nitrate
leaching and nitrous oxide emis-
sions.
The university says the drone
"measures how crops react to
stress, such as drought, nutri-
ents deficiency or pests." It says
the plane can document a field's
status "down to centimeters."
With the detailed knowledge,
farmers can quickly spot prob-
lem areas and address them
with a precise response, Bruno
Basso, an ecosystem scientist at
Michigan State, said in a state-
ment.
"When you have a cut and
need disinfectant, you don't dive

it only where you need it and in
the quantity that is strictly neces-
sary," said Basso, who also works
at Michigan State's Kellogg Bio-
logical Station. "Rather than
covering the entire field with fer-
tilizer, it can be applied exactly
where it's needed. We basically
try to do the right thing, at right
place, at the right time."
The drone has three censors
- a high-resolution radiometer,
a thermal camera to monitor
plant temperature and hydra-
tion, and a laser scanner.
Basso said the drone "is like
an X-ray. Before we can diagnose
the problem, we need to collect
as many details as possible."
The sensor data can be
plugged into the System
Approach for Land-Use Sus-
tainability model. Known as
SALUS, the crop tool forecasts
crop, soil, water, and nutrient
conditions in the climate of the
present and the future, the uni-
versity said.
It also can be used to evaluate
crop rotations, planting dates,
irrigation and fertilizer use and
project crop yields and their
effect on the land.
"It's based on actual need, not
on tradition, not on history or
a plan recommended by some-
one else," Basso said. "It's what
plants need now and is the ulti-

New search, no students
Students must pressure administration for a voice in big decisions
In 2002 - the last time a search for a new University president
occurred - the Presidential Search Committee consisted of
10 faculty members, one student, an alumnus and four other
stakeholders. With University President Mary Sue Coleman step-
ping down in July 2014, the University embarks on a new search
headed up by the Board of Regents along with eight faculty mem-
bers working to choose her successor - without a single student on
the committee. While the committee has invited students to partici-
pate in various forums over the next few months, at least one seat
should have been reserved for a student on the committee. At the
very least, students deserve an explanation for the changes in policy
during this presidential search.

ast week, the Supreme Judi-
cial Court of Massachusetts
heard arguments from a
pair of atheist
parents who
wish to strike
the phrase
"under God"
from the Pledge
of Allegiance
recited in the
state, insisting BARRY
that it ostracizes BELMONT
children like
their own from
a patriotic process. They claim that
it is their children's right to par-
ticipate in all forms of the state's
democracy and they shouldn't be
excluded simply for lacking a cer-
tain religious belief.
While the plaintiffs in the case
claimthatonlythe "under God" por-
tion of the pledge shouldn't be there,
I contend that the whole thing has
no businessbeing recited by anyone.
There are many good argu-
ments against reciting the pledge
in schools, including the fact that
making children - who are unable
to consent to anything - swear an
oath to their country every day is
quasi-tyrannical, borderline creepy
and wholly mind-numbing. There
are even those in favor of the notion
but against the recitation, argu-
ing that if you want to make some-
thing mean as little as possible you
should make children recite it every
day for 13 years.
But even beyond those argu-
ments, the pledge itself makes no
sense. Let's just start at the begin-
ning: "I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America, and
to the Republic for which it stands."
Flag, United States, Republic.
First of all, I owe no allegiance to
a flag. A flag, being little more than

Matt Nolan, the former Michigan Student
Assembly president - now called Central Stu-
dent Government - who held one of the two
student seats in the former committee, said
that the inability to reach a fair compromise
for student input this time around deserves
an explanation. "Whether you agree with the
regents' decision or not, I do think it is a fair
question to ask the regents why it is different
this time. Explaining that rationale could go a
long way." Nolan is correct; the student body
does deserve anexplanation.
Students should have a tangible voice in
this process. The University recognized this in
2002. However, this year, eight seats have been
given to regents and eight to high-level staff.
Since the regents have decided to change the
makeup of the committee substantially from
the previous search, it should be far from con-
troversial or groundbreaking that another seat
be given to students.
This lack of input is just one instance of the
administration making important decisions
that greatly affect students without consult-
ing the student body. The recent controversial
change to a general-admission policy to the Big
House for football games was done similarly,

without input from the Central Student Gov-
ernment. The move is tremendously unpopular
with students, and a petition on the CSG web-
site garnered 2,600 signatures within 12 hours.
Along with planning forums for student
involvement, the committee is also accepting
public nominations for president at the email
UMich.President@russellreynolds.com.
While students should participate through
these avenues, it's clear these initiatives are
an empty gesture to appease students and
does not give them their due.
Having been denied a seat in the commit-
tee, students must seek other ways of mak-
ing their voice heard. The public forum dates
have now been announced for the search
committee, the first of which is to be held
at the Ann Arbor campus on Sept. 17. At the
forums, students must express disappoint-
ment at not being given adequate represen-
tation along with voicing their opinion. The
president is vital to a school, and students
must care about the selection. Now it's up
to students to pressure the administration
and vocalize their concerns so the next time
around, students will be given the voice they
should always be guaranteed.

BRAD FINGEROOT jIVIEWPOINT
Change the objective

As Congress and the country observe the
unfolding events in Syria, Americans must
understand the United States's role in the
world. Our nation is a bastion of freedom,
one with a history of promoting the cause
of liberty and self-government both at home
and abroad. Lest we ever forget, America is
a safer place when the world is rid of tyrants
and despots. With this in mind, we must also
have the clear understanding that for Ameri-
can action to justly occur, it must have the
direct interests of the United States and its
allies at the forefront.
Every foreign policy decision by the United
States has a butterfly effect, one that chang-
es the geopolitical landscape all across the
world. This idea highlights the significance
of the inexcusable misstep President Barack
Obama made by using the same semantic
terminology - "red line" - when discuss-
ing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use
of chemical weapons and Iran's development
of nuclear arms. In standing idly by when we
know to a very high degree of certainty that
Assad's forces used sarin gas, we are sending
the signal to Iran that a "red line" is nothing
more than a bluff.
The conundrum for the United States,
beyond the national fatigue pertaining to mil-
itary intervention efforts, is that regardless of
who prevails, we will be faced with a hostile
government in Syria. Under Assad, Syria is a
terrorist state, one linked and subordinate to
Iran and its Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. If Assad
is toppled, however, the chances of moderate
leadership appear dim. There are more than
1,200 rebel groups in Syria, and Secretary of
State John Kerry estimates that one in four of
the rebels are radical jihadists. But while the
radical elements of the resistance may be few
in numbers, groups such as al-Nusra Front,
an al-Qaida associate, are far better orga-
nized, armed and trained than their mod-
erate counterparts. If Assad is toppled, it's
possible, therefore, that the new regime will
be led by extremists from groups with direct
ties to al-Qaida.
Chemical weapons in the hands of either
Assad's regime or the al-Qaida-associated
rebels present a clear and urgent threat to the
United States. By either diplomatic means -

working with Russia and the United Nations
Security Council, or military means, the Unit-
ed States must ensure that chemical weapons
are out of Syria and destroyed. With sarin gas
in the hands of groups hostile to America,
Israel and our allies across the globe, we do
not have the luxury to be complacent. If these
weapons remain in circulation, we are leav-
ing ourselves vulnerable to the next attack
being far closer to home. The thought of a
sarin gas attack in the streets of Jerusalem,
the New York subway system or our nation's
capital is far too horrible to contemplate, but
a salivating idea to those who wish to endan-
ger our freedom and disrupt our way of life.
The ideaofa diplomatic solutionthatmeets
the vital national security interests of the
United States is certainly preferable to com-
mitting military resources to Syria. While it's
too early to tell how serious this possibility is
to becoming a reality, leaders on both sides
of the partisan aisle and in the international
community appear little more than cautious-
ly hopeful. There is significant distance that
both Russia and Assad must move, in terms
of documentation and certification that the
weapons are removed, in order to gain Ameri-
can and international consensus.
In the event that diplomatic negotiations
fail, Obama is requesting Congress give him
the authorization to launch an air assault
against Syria in response to Assad's use of
chemical weapons. His stated objective has
not been to destroy the chemical weapons,
but to punish the regime for its actions. I
would firmly urge members of the U.S. House
of Representatives and Senate to reject this
proposal. Punitive action in Syria, strength-
ening al-Nusra Front and the dangerous
rebels' position, does not serve the inter-
ests or the security of the American people.
Instead, I believe the president and Congress
should agree on a resolution with the sole
military objective of destroying the chemi-
cal weapons that present a clear danger to
the United States and our allies. Our lead-
ers have the responsibility to take decisive
action and meet the challenge of ensuring
a safer America.

By TEHREEM SAJJAD
Daily Arts Writer
As a part of its regular speak-
er series, the Penny W. Stamps
School of Art & Design is host-
ing a lecture
this week by ftnyW.
one of the most
respected and ""'
influential Di SAd
contemporary
photogra-
phers, Mary SeriS Mary
Ellen Mark. OMA
Through her
artwork, books Thursday
and edito- at5p.m.
rial magazine
ra mgzne Michigan Theater
work, Markhas
gained world- Free
wide visibility.
For the past four decades,
Mark has traveled extensively
around the world to capture
moments that portray a high
degree of humanism. Her snap-
shots of human and cultural

diversity are considered exem-
plars in the field of documentary
photography.
"She has an incredibly long
and successful career," said
Chrisstina Hamilton, the direc-
tor of the lecture series. "The
work that she has been doing
lately - she was commissioned
by the pharmaceutical company
Novartis - is very interesting.
She was commissioned by the
company to go to the seven sites
in the world that have the worst
incidents of malaria and to doc-
ument the situation."
A few of Mark's awards
include the Cornell Capa Award,
the Infinity Award for Journal-
ism and the Photographer of the
Year Award from the Friends of
Photography. Her work, includ-
ing photo essays and portraits,
has been published in magazines
such as the "New York Time
Magazine," "LIFE," "Vanity
Fair" and "Rolling Stone." Addi-
tionally, Mark has also executed
photographed advertising cam-
paigns for Barnes and Noble,
Keds, Eileen Fisher, as well as
British Levis.
Some of Mark's most notable
works include her portrayals of

Mother Teresa, Indian circuses
and brothels in Bombay. One
of the most common aspects of
Mark's photography is her inter-
est in people, especially those
who occupy the fringes of society
and whose stories might other-
wise never be told if not through
the lens of a camera. A few piv-
otal themes seen consistently in
Mark's collection include such
societal concerns as homeless-
ness, drug addiction, mental ill-
ness and teenage pregnancy.
Mark's images convince their
audience of their depth because,
instead of observing from the out-
side, Mark attempts to perceive
her subjects' environment from
within. By becoming an integrat-
ing part of their world, Mark is
able to grasp the inner realms of
her subjects' life.
As a photographer for over 40
years, Mark has perfected her
craft. She's traveled all over the
world, including India, Turkey
and Africa, to capture the most
miniature and simple aspects of
peoples' lives. As part of her lec-
ture, Mark will provide her audi-
ence with an overview of her
work and also discuss her project
with Novartis.

DISNEY
"This cricket will help me get lucky."
Revis of ulan' reveals.
real-1fe lessons

By ANNA SADOKSKAYA
Senior Arts Editor
There were so many options
to choose from: thrillers, sci-
fi classics, new arrivals, a few
TV shows ... so, I went for the
obvious choice and clicked
"animated movies" on my Air
France-provided touch-screen
TV. Moving right past "The
Croods," "Epic" and "Monsters
University," I wildly clicked on
"Mulan," giving the woman in
front of me a swift concussion.
Disney is great. Nothing
brings on the nostalgia more
than old-school Disney fairytale
movies. They got some things
wrong, but what they managed
to do was create a world where
"a dream that you wish will come
true." I could not be stopped.
A greater force willed me to
watch this movie, in my near-
delirious state of sleep depri-
vation. I wanted to believe in a
world where a simple Chinese
girl could become the greatest
warrior in China. I wanted to
believe in a world where ances-
tors and spirits helped their liv-
ing descendants. I also wanted
to sing along to "Reflection."
There's no excuse for not
watching "Mulan," but if it's
been a while, the premise is
this: Mulan's father is called to
war against the Huns (they've
simply scaled the Great Wall of
China and are on a killing spree),

Embrace campus
arts opportunities

Discover what
performance art is
like at the 'U'
By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
When freshmen arrive at the
University, they usually have a
pretty good idea of a lot of the
goings-on that happen all over
campus. They know about the
football games, the parties and
the various restaurants and
shops. But most freshmen lack
any knowledge when it comes to
all the arts events offered on and
off campus, which is unfortu-
nate because there are so many
other exciting events to partici-
pate in.
When I first arrived at Michi-
gan, I was in the same position. I
knew I wanted to participate in
and go to arts events and, after
some digging, I found so many
great outlets of expression that
it would be a crime not to share
some of my discoveries.
First off, the University Musi-
cal Society brings performers
from all over the country, and
some international, to Hill and
Rackham auditoriums. The per-
formances range from singers
to dancers and, several times
throughout the year, UMS offers
trips to Michigan Theater to
watch live broadcasted plays
from London's National Theatre.
Tickets can be a bit pricey if you
wish to sit close to the stage, but

REPORT
From Page 1A
undergraduate program ranked
seventh for the second year in a
row, behind MIT, Berkeley and
Stanford University, among others.
The U.S. News and World
Report's methodology for deter-
mining rankings centers on two
main points: each university's
official mission and an evaluation
of up to 16 indicators of academic
excellence, including an assess-
ment of the administrators at
each institution, student retention
rates, alumni donations and finan-
cial resources.
Though the publication draws
fromanumberofsourcestocompile
the rankings, experts question the
reliabilityofsuchmeasurements.
The U.S. News and World
Report also measures the amount
of money spent on each individual
student to calculate the quality
of a university's degree. Fitzger-
ald said the University does not
believe spending more money per
student necessarily corresponds
with better academic quality.
"It actually penalizes institu-
tions like Michigan, where we've
been able to find more efficient
ways to deliver services and still
maintain thehighestpossible qual-
ity ofeducation," Fitzgerald said.
Earlier this year, U.S. News
World andReportranked 99 of the
University's graduate programs in
the top 10, placing itinthe top five
for all public and private universi-
ties in the nation. The School of
Social Work's graduate program
was ranked the best of its kind in
the country.

FUNDING
From Page 1A
Greimel (D-Auburn Hills)
expressed concern that the
amendment could delay
important decisions for school
districts statewide, such as
what textbooks to buy and
how to proceed with the cur-
riculum.
Despite this potential road-
block, bipartisan support
remains for the standards
as well as optimism that the
amendment will be reversed
before the budget deadline.
Greimel and Walsh believe a
resolution to move forward
with the standards will be
passed this month.
Walsh, the second-ranking
House Republican, said oppo-
nents of the Common Core
fear it might create some sort
of formalized national cur-
riculum imposed by the federal
government. He said he is con-
fident that, as members learn
more about the standards, their
fears will be dispelled and they
can move forward with the
bill, which is expected to come
out of committee and onto the
House floor either this week or
next.
The condition of the state's
roads is another issue that
legislative leaders and Sny-
der hope to resolve before the
budget deadline. Despite broad
support for fixing roads among
both legislators and citizens,
there has been little consensus
over how such a measure would
be paid for.

According to Walsh, the
House was able to allocate more
funds for road repair in the
upcoming fiscal year due to an
unexpected revenue increase.
However, the increase is not
substantial enough to fund
future projects.
Walsh said trying to find
new revenue streams to cover
what he believes is "billion-
dollar-a-year under-spending"
on the state's part for roads is
very difficult.
"It's not just a Republican
or Democratic issue," Walsh
said. "Our citizens are tax-
weary, and we've got to come
up with a proposal that makes
them feel comfortable that the
money will go to (improving)
roads and nothing else and
won't come at the cost of edu-
cation."
If the legislature were to
raise taxes in order to pay for
road improvement, Walsh said
one circulating suggestion is
to remove the state's sales tax
on gas, since that revenue does
not go towards roads. Gas-tax
revenue, however, is allocated
to the state's education budget,
and any dramatic reduction
there would be met with wide-
spread opposition.
While Greimel is pleased
with the bipartisan approach

and House Democrats would
still like to see more increases
in higher-education spend-
ing and would like to fight for
more progressive tax policies
for the middle class and work-
ing poor. As the $49.5-billion

budget for fiscal year 2014
currently stands, K-12 edu-
cation will see a 3-percent
increase in funding. However,
Greimel said he's not confi-
dent that such measures will
pass while his party is in the
minority.
Walsh acknowledged that
while the parties do hold very
different views in areas such as
labor, spending and civil liber-
ties, the House does operate
on a very bipartisan basis - he
approximates that over 90 per-
cent of the bills that come out of
the legislature pass in a biparti-
san fashion.
"By and large and at a great
rate, much of our work is done
on a bipartisan basis," he said.
"People just don't talk about
it."
Meanwhile, one issue that
neither leader mentioned was
the bankruptcy and pension
crisis in Detroit. Walsh said
the House is letting the situ-
ation play out at the munici-
pal level in bankruptcy court.
When judge comes closer to
rendering a an opinion, there
will be some level of activity
by the House, he said, noting
that any action the legislature
could take now would be pre-
mature.
"There's nothing for the leg-
islature under our Constitution
to do at the present time," he
said. "We'd be out in front of
(emergency financial manager)
Kevyn Orr, and the governor
and for that matter the bank-
ruptcy court if we began trying
to legislate some solution to the
issue."

Miranda said the death of a
student is one of "the most pain-
ful things for the entire commu-
nity." Moving forward, the dean
said she'll try to highlight the
strength of the SNRE commu-
nity - one Wilson passionately
helped to build - as students
and faculty deal with the loss
of a colleague and friend. She
said many members of the com-
munity have already been tell-
ing stories, sharing anecdotes

and remembering their positive
interactions with Wilson.
She also encouraged students
and faculty to seek additional
resources if needed, such as
speaking with a counselor at
Counseling and Psychological
Services, which is located on
the third floor of the Michigan
Union.
Miranda said Wilson's death
serves as a reminder to value
the importance of open lines of
communication, both in times
of tragedy and in the everyday
functioning of a school.

Miranda wrote in her email.
"Call everyone you love and tell

marily on the fundamentals
of business and leadership.
Courses emphasizing business
essentials such as marketing and
finance will make up the basis
of the curriculum, and students
may choose two electives to per-
sonalize their degree.
Beil said students will take
part in workshops outside of
class.
"(The workshops will include)
leadership modulestotrainthem
about understandingthemselves
as leaders, and understanding
how to lead themselves and what
that entails, and then under-
standing how they can use that
knowledge to lead other people
in their career as well," he said.
According to Mark Garrett,
the program's managing direc-
tor, the degree's course load is
tough, as students push through
30.75 credits in a relatively short
period of time.
The program is based on a

cohort model, meaning students
go through classes and work-
shops together in groups.
"A cohort is really going to be
important for them to develop
their own network - a support
system," he said.
Garrett said workshops with
the Career Services Program at
the Business School will train
Master of Management students
in interview skills, resume writ-
ing and the "30-second Elevator
Pitch."
Applicants to the program
will be required to submit GRE
or GMAT scores, two letters
of recommendation, a resume,
transcript and two essays. There
are three different deadlines
for applications, which will be
reviewed within two weeks
after each round.
Garrett said officials are not
sure how many students will
make up the program's first year.
He said the quality and diversity
of the admitted students will
be more important than hitting
a specific number for the first
cohort.


CSG
From Page 1A
Vice President Bobby Dishell, an
increased assembly interest in the
commission's existence prompted
its creation.
In an e-mail obtained by The
Michigan Daily dated Aug. 7,
Audia expressed her interest in
the commission and her willing-
ness to address any queries with
regards to the commission. While
she was not an active member of
the commission in the prior year,
her e-mail suggested that her
future affiliation with the com-
mission was determined before
the commission was publicly cre-
ated eight days later.

"I truly believe that VYV serves
as an essential component to the
CSG commissions," Audia wrote.
"I would be more than happy to
answer any questions to the best
of my ability!"
Four previous members of
the group - which encourages
civic participation on campus -
addressed the assembly, arguing
that Audia is not qualified to be
chair of the commission due to
her lack of prior experience on
the board. The members also said
that they weren't made aware of
the position's vacancy.
In response, CSG president
Michael Proppe told members
of the assembly that he sent out
applications via e-mail to a list-
serv of CSG representatives in

early August in an effort to fill the
position.
Todd Flynn, the previous chair
of the Voice Your Vote commis-
sion, said he was concerned with
the proposed nomination of
Audia.
"We're not here to babysit peo-
ple ... to raise someone in Voice
Your Vote," Todd Flynn said. "If
you want continuity, we'd have
the same chair we had last year."
Proppe also accused Flynn of
running the commission outside
the oversight of the CSG con-
stitution, noting that group was
intending to hold internal nomi-
nations for its next chair. Flynn
responded that the commission
has its own constitution, but
Proppe corrected him in noting

that it falls under CSG's constitu-
tion.
Responding to remarks by
members of the group, Audia said
she feels she's capable of being
chair.
"I want to inform you that I
do not need a babysitter," she
said. "(I'm) not coming in here
to undermine Todd's authority;
I want to reiterate that I hope to
lead this commission."
Following the comments, the
assembly went into closed session
for about 35 minutes. When the
commission returned to an open
session, Assembly speaker Andy
ModellsaidProppehadwithdrawn
his nomination of Audia, and that a
formal application process for the
position would begin Wednesday.

Mayor to be silent at 9 11 event

No political
speeches allowed
at Bloomberg's last
ceremony as mayor
NEW YORK (AP) - When this
year's Sept. 11 anniversary cere-
mony unfolds at ground zero, the
mayor who has helped orches-
trate the observances from their
start will be watching for his last
time in office. And saying noth-
ing.
Over his years as mayor and
chairman of the National Sept.
11 Memorial & Museum, Michael
Bloomberg has sometimes tan-
gled with victims' relatives, reli-
gious leaders and other elected
officials over an event steeped in
symbolism and emotion.
But his administration has
largely succeeded at its goal of
keeping the commemoration cen-
tered on the attacks' victims and
their families and relatively free
of political image-making. In that
spirit, no politicians - includ-
ing the mayor - were allowed
to speak last year or will be this
year.
Memorial organizers expect
to take primary responsibility
for the ceremony next year and
say they plan to continue con-
centrating the event on victims'
loved ones, even as the forth-

coming museum creates a new,
broader framework for remem-
bering 9/11.
"As things evolve in the
future, the focus on the remem-
brance is going to stay sacro-
sanct," memorial President Joe
Daniels says.
At Wednesday's ceremony
on the 2-year-old memorial
plaza, relatives will again read
the names of the nearly 3,000
people who died when hijacked
jets crashed into the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon
and near Shanksville, Pa. Read-
ers also will recite the 1993
trade center bombing victims'
names.
At the Flight 93 National
Memorial in Shanksville, where
Wednesday's ceremony will
include bell-ringing and wreath-
laying, officials gathered Tuesday
to mark the start of construction
on a visitor center. The Pentagon
plans a Wednesday morning cer-
emony for victims' relatives and
survivors of the attacks, with
wreath-laying and remarks from
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
and other officials, and an after-
noon observance for Pentagon
workers.
Deciding how to mark the
anniversary of the worst terror
strike in U.S. history was a sensi-
tive task for Bloomberg and other
leaders in the months after the
attacks, perhaps especially for

the then-new mayor. Officials
were planning a memorial ser-
vice for thousands of families
from 90 countries, while also
setting a tone for how the public
would commemorate 9/1.
"That was the challenge that
we faced, and it was an enor-
mous one," recalls Jonathan
Greenspun, who then was part of
Bloomberg's community affairs
unit and now is a political consul-
tant. "There was a recognition,
by the mayor, that the ceremony
had to transcend typical memo-
rial services and the politics that
are sometimes associated with
them."
Officials fielded about 4,500
suggestions - including a Broad-
way parade honoring rescue
workers and a one-minute black-
out of all Manhattan - before
crafting a plan centered on read-
ing names at ground zero.
"Our intent is to have a day of
observances that are simple and
powerful," Bloomberg said as
he and then-Gov. George Pataki
announced the plans in 2002.
For years, the ceremonies
did include politicians reading
names and texts, and Bloomberg
made remarks that over the years
touched on Hurricane Katrina,
the 2005 London subway bomb-
ings and the Biblical King David's
grief at the death of his son Abso-
lom, among other topics.
Bloomberg's role hasn't always

been comfortable, especially for
a mayor whose brisk, pragmatic
personality and early criticisms
of the memorial struck some vic-
tims' relatives as insensitive.
When the ceremony was shift-
ed to nearby Zuccotti Park in
2007 because of rebuilding at the
trade center site, some victims'
relatives threatened to boycott
the occasion.
The lead-up to the 10th anni-
versary brought pressure to
invite more political figures and
to include clergy in the ceremony.
And when Bloomberg mentioned.
the idea of ending the name-
readingthe next year, some of the
relatives were aghast.
By next year's anniversary,
Bloomberg will be out of office,
and the museum is expected to
be open beneath the memorial
plaza.
While the memorial hon-
ors those killed, the museum is
intended to present a broader
picture of 9/11, including the
experiences of survivors and first
responders.
But the organizers expect they
"will always keep the focus on
the families on the anniversary,"
Daniels said. "We see ourselves
as carrying on a legacy."
That focus was clear as rela-
tives gathered last September
on the tree-laden plaza, with a
smaller crowd than in some prior
years.

Six seats are part
of agreement with
intl' creditors
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -
Shareholders of Cyprus' larg-
est bank on Tuesday elected
six Russians to sit on its new,
16-member board of directors,
a consequence of the country's
bailout agreement with interna-
tional creditors.
The vote puts more foreign
nationals on the board of the
Bank of Cyprus than ever before.
The fact that they are all Rus-
sians - one of whom, Vladimir
Strzhalkovskiy, was elected by.
other board members as vice
chairman - reflects the large
stake they had in Cyprus' bank-
ingsystem.
Russians kept billions
in Cypriot bank accounts
because of benefits such as
low taxes and high interest
rates, helping to swell the size
of the financial sector at its
peak to eight times the coun-
try's entire economy.
Cyprus turned for help to
its euro area partners and the
International Monetary Fund in
June, 2012, to rescue its Greece-
exposed banks and to stave
off bankruptcy. But Cyprus'
creditors sought a fundamental
restructuring of the country's
financial system which they saw
as unsustainable.
According to the terms of
Cyprus' rescue deal it agreed
in March, depositors with over
100,000 euros in the Bank of
Cyprus, and the second-largest
lender Laiki, were forced to take
huge losses on their savings in
order for the country to qualify
for a10billion euro ($13.2 billion)
loan.
Money from the deposit grab
- or 'haircut' - was used to
replenish Bankof Cyprus' capi-
tal buffers, while Laiki ceased

to operate and large chunks of
it were absorbed by the larger
lender.
The haircut sapped trust
in Cypriot banks, prompt-
ing authorities to impose
restrictions on money trans-
fers and withdrawals to pre-
vent a run. Many restrictions
have since been relaxed,
but officials say it may take
many months before they're
fully lifted.
Some 47.5Spercent ofuninsured
deposits in the Bank of Cyprus
were converted into shares, turn-
ing large Russian depositors into
big shareholders requiring repre-
sentation on the board.
The Russian board members
include Igor Lojevsky, who has
worked at both the World Bank
and Germany's Deutsche Bank.
The board also elected Cypriot
Christis Hassapis as its chair-
man.
Some 3.500 shareholders
attended the banks' annual
general meeting either in per-
son or by proxy, representing
53.6 percent of the total share
capital.
The meeting was a tumultu-
ous affair as several old share-
holders - who saw almost all of
the value of their shares slashed
under the bailout's conditions -
loudly opposed the proceedings
because they hadn't received
the banks' post-bailout finan-
cial results. Some stormed out
of the meeting, saying that they
were being asked to legitimize
"illegal" decisions made without
their consent.
The new board replaces an
interim one which had been
tasked with stabilizing the
bank in the bailout's after-
math and starting to downsize
it after absorbing Laiki's oper-
ations. The bank still faces
significant challenges, includ-
ing how to deal with non-per-
forming loans and restoring
trust.

Michigan looking elsewhere
after Gallon's big performance

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison says he's not a bet-
ting man, nor an expert on wide
receivers. But if he did gamble,
he'd put all his money on Michi-
gan whenever fifth-year senior
wide reciever Jeremy Gallon is on
the field. And
just because NOTEBOOK
he's mostly con-
cerned with what happens on the
other side of the ball doesn't mean
he can't appreciate the game Gal-
lon had against Notre Dame.
"That guy, he's as tough as
there'is," Mattison said. "He just
comes to work every day, does
everything you ask, has a smile on
his face. He's Michigan. I've got so
much respect for him, it's unbe-
lievable."
But as much as Saturday night
was Gallon'sgame, offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges is more con-
cerned with making sure the rest
of the receiving corps is capable of
having the same kind of big night.
It's undeniable that Gallon and
redshirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner seemed to share a brain
last weekend. But other receivers
need to have that same chemistry
with Gardner too.
During the early days of their
Michigan careers, Gardner, Gal-
lon and senior Drew Dileo - who
caught a touchdown pass on Sat-
urday - spent hours practicing
with each other as backups. That
dynamic was briefly disrupted last
season when Gardner was used as
receiver, but Dileo said the chem-
istry picked right back up again
when Gardner's position was
cemented atcquarterback.
So, when Gardner starts to
scramble during a game - which
doesn't come as a surprise to Gal-
lon and Dileo anymore - they

instinctively know where he's
going to be.
"It's being around Devin,"
Dileo said. "Devin scrambling,
you've seen him in practice for a
couple years. What you see on Sat-
urday is what we see on Tuesday,
Wednesday (and) Thursday. It's
not like he goes in the game and
decides to scramble."
I DREAM OF JAKE RYAN: Mat-
tison lies awake at night, smiling
from the scene that continuously
plays out in his mind.
In the scenario, redshirt junior
linebacker Jake Ryan has com-
pletely recovered from his torn
anterior cruciate ligament, and
Mattison smiles to the media as
he makes the announcement that
Ryan is ready to start the upcom-
ing game in his usual position at
strongside linebacker.
Then, Mattison snaps out of the
fantasy and has to remind him-
self that Ryan is still in recovery.
But that doesn't stop him from

gushing whenever Ryan's name is
brought up.
. "Jake Ryan is beautiful," Mat-
tison said. "Every time I see Jake
Ryan, I smile. We won't play him
early, but he's working extremely
hard. When the doctors say he's
ready, he'll be ready."
Whenever the date of Ryan's
return arrives - his timetable is
mid-October - Mattison still isn't
quite sure how he'll fit into the
position now that junior Brennen
Beyer and fifth-year senior Cam
Gordon have started to make a
name for themselves by rotating
at SAM.
"Brennen and Cam are doing
a nice job," Mattison said. "A lot
of other people would have said,
'How are they going do this?' But
no, those two guys, they're play-
ing really good football. It's their
position. We just have to see what
happens from there."
A YOUTHFUL 'D': So much
of Michigan's matchup with the

Fighting Irish was focused on how
the interior line stood up next to
the likes of Notre Dame's big boys
opposite the ball.
But that's completely ignoring
how the Wolverines' own defense
fared against the Fighting Irish's
veteran offensive line.
Mattison noted that the the big-
gest issue was the technique of the
front four and the performance of
the pass rush, but that inexperi-
ence was the biggest factor. They
had trouble pressuring quarter-
back Tommy Rees and didn't reg-
ister any sacks. Upon reviewing
game tape, the coach noted just
three upperclassmen were on the
field for Michigan, with the rest
being freshmen or sophomores.
"(Youth is) not an excuse,
because you don't need to make
an excuse," he said. "Our game
plan was not to sell the farm a lot.
We didn't want to put our second-
ary in a position where a big play
could get us."

Making a Movement: How a small group of students united
behind a fringe issue and changed University policy
"What was really incredible about this was that such a strong
movement happened among members of an elite group (UM
students) who were working hard to make it easier for other
people to join that group. Most of the students in this movement
had nothing to gain personally from its success, but they fought
on behalf of others.
So now can UM students fit for others and for themselves,

Picture this: You're walking
down a busy street in a city filled
with loud noises and stimulating
sights. You pass a small bakery and
catch a whiff of the most recent
batch of cookies. A chill runs
down your spine. You wince. Your
mind flashes back to that time
when you were six, learning to
bake cookies with your grandma
and accidentally burned your
hand. Your hand became vibrantly
red, blistered and it was painful
for a week. Your mood converts
from bliss to melancholy. Until
this moment, you hadn't thought
about that in years, decades even.
And all this came from a smell?
"How weird!" you think. But no,
it's not weird: It's neuroscience.
Okay, so maybe this didn't hap-
pen to you. Maybe you didn't ever
burn your hand or even learn to
bake cookies - a true crime - but
the idea that a smell can trigger
memories, both good and bad,
is true. It's called the Proustian

Time.'
Unlike the other senses which
pass through the thalamus - a
relay station for movement and
sensory information in the brain -

before moving to the cerebral cor-
tex for processing, smells transmit
directly to the olfactory bulb,
without interruption. In fact, a
smell has been proven more likely
to trigger emotional memories
than a sight or a sound because of
its direct entrance to the brain.
The olfactory bulb is located
close to both the amygdala - the
area of the brain where emotion
and emotional memory is pro-
cessed - and the hippocampus
- the area of the brain connected
with more general memory.
"The memories
associated
with emotions
and smells are
likely to be
unexpected and
less focused,
more nostalgic."
The close proximity of these
regions with the site of processing

ca
actively try to remember that time
your dog died or when you saw
a car accident. However, when
one focuses on details, they don't
focus on the feelings they are feel-
ing. For example, you're trying to
remember what your professor is
saying in class. When you recall
that moment, you remember the
words, but you don't remember
that you were depressed from get-
ting a less than satisfactory grade
on that paper you just were hand-
ed back. Details and emotions are
stored in two different areas of the
brain. Thus the memories associ-
ated with emotions and smells
are likely to be unexpected and
less focused, more nostalgic. The
things you didn't want to remem-
ber but are encoded in your brain
anyway.
This is why when you smell a
man walking by wearing the same
cologne as your ex you may be
filled with sadness, or when you
smell a flower, it could trigger
your happy memories of Hawaii.

For every cadet in Army ROTC, the
acronym "LDAC" is something omi-
nous. It represents fear, expectation,
anxiety and the unique feeling of proving
one's self. Pronounced "eldahk," it stands for
Leadership Development and Assessment
Course - a nationwide camp that sees thou-
sands of future Army Officers every year.
The course lasts 29 days, and is housed at
Fort Lewis near Seattle, Wash. The purpose
of LDAC is to serve as a culminating train-
ing event and evalua-
tion period for any cadet
wishing to earn a com-
mission in the United
States Army.
I've participated in 6
Army ROTC since my"
freshman year at the
University. Our pro-
gram stresses a strong
emphasis on training
us to perform well at N
LDAC. Why? Because g
our overall performance
at LDAC says a lot about
us. It speaks to how we
handle stress, how much
we have learned, how
well we work with oth-
ers, and whether or not
we can handle military
environments. It's a mili-
tary and life test, and we
get a career-changing
grade.
Our evaluations are
part of our overall packet
which determine our
branch - Infantry, Engi-
neer, Aviation, Military Intelligence, etc. -
and duty station.
LDAC is broken into three phases: garri-
son, assembly area and patrol base. Garrison
is spent sleeping in dorm-like buildings. The
assembly area and patrol base phases are
spent in large tents with periodic restless
nights in the woods.
Since LDAC is about evaluating cadets
ability to lead, our leadership positions
change every day.
While in leadership, our every move is
critiqued.
When my evaluation day came in garrison,
I approached it with high energy. I was highly
motivated, ready to wake everyone up, fully
prepared for our day's training, and ready to
"valiantly" lead my peers. In truth - though
I did not know it at the time - I was leading

in appearance, not actuality. It was too soon
to understand the needs of my squad, and
my motivation developed as a result of my
assessment. When I strutted into Captain
Brooker's office to receive my evaluation, I
fully anticipated an "E" for "excellent."
Minutes later, I left confused and disap-
pointed: "S" for "satisfactory."
Surely the system was broken. Surely I
deserved an "E", and the captain did not
know what he was talking about. However,
Lw
-(

laugh, make plans. You'll make it through."
With my renewed attitude firmly in
hand, LDAC seemed quite a bit easier. My
goals no longer circumvented my ego,
but something much more important. My
notions about leadership were challenged,
and I am a better person for it. But, in order
to better paint a picture of LDAC, it's better
to look at all cadets as a whole, rather than
one cadet alone.
Transitioning out of garrison, our regi-

the smell stimulus provides the
link of smells with memory. Like-
wise, it explains why the memo-
ries associated with smell are of N
the emotional type rather than the
episodic type, which involve par-
ticular details.v
This goes into a more compli-
cated idea associated with the
smell memories: They are com-
pletely involuntary. When one
actively tries to remember things,
they focus on details, on the ele-
ments they want to remember
- they're selective. You wouldn't

it was later that same night that I learned
something about my own leadership. A mem-
ber of my squad told me a cadet, James, was
outside crying on the steps. When I went out-
side to talk to him, he told me he had lost his
medical qualification for Aviation and maybe
even the Army as a whole.
"How crushing," I remember thinking.
This kid's dream of being in the military is
being threatened, and here I am getting ang-
sty over an "S" rating. Something became
apparent to me that night. I could choose to
focus on myself and my own desire for suc-
cess, or I could seek to help those who need-
ed a calm and comforting voice. Helping my
peers through LDAC was a vow to which I
became truly committed after that moment.
That night after talking with James, I left
him with a note: "If you want to make God

ment moved out of luxury and into the
woods. Next stop: Land Navigation. Four
nights of unsheltered sleep - no buildings
or tents - were accompanied by busy days in
the hot sun. Physical stress met psychologi-
cal wear and tear, and so began the process
of emotional decay. The once optimistic felt
their resolve smoldering beneath them. Pain
from chaffing, a lack of proper hydration,
freeze-dried food and poor sleeping condi-
tions started to break the locks, and demons
started showing their ugly heads.
Our food came in the form of Meals Ready
to Eat. They are freeze-dried packages con-
taining snacks, entrees and deserts, but lack-
ing the flavor and texture we take for granted
at home. Proper politicking ensured a good-
tasting MRE, thus moist towelettes and Skit-
ties became a valid currency.

The living conditions during marksman-
ship, obstacle course, hand-grenade-assault"'
course, first aid, squad tactics and patrolling
did not much improve the tempo. It took
strong, interpersonal control to not act on
the frustration and discomfort, to suppress
lashing out, talking back, or being hurtful to
one another. Not everyone broke down, but
at some point many cadets became toxic to
working as a team - yelling and de-railing
exercises. While fixated on our own dis-
comfort and pain, it's dif-
ficult to remember those
around us and the purpose
behind our training. The
emotionally resilient cadets
were able to ignore their
own ailments and care for
their buddies instead.
LDAC teaches two pow-
erful lessons: First, we learn
about our own leadership
style and how. we change
under stress. We learn that
being genuine and taking
care of each other is the
most fulfilling of feelings.
Second, that people really,
change. In the absence of
sleep, quality food and van-
ity, people lose sight of the
big picture. These are rare
lessons; ones only experi-
ence can teach.
LDAC is anticipation and
expectation. It is four hours,
silent, laying in a bush look-
ing down the sights of an
M16. LDAC is ignoring the
mosquitos and heavy eye-
lids. LDAC is learning about oneself. LDAC
is seeing what people can become, both posi-
tive and negative. But, most importantly,
LDAC is an opportunity to see who we are
at our limits. It is a great, tough and worth-
while opportunity, and not one I would trade
for any other experience.
On the bus ride back from patrolling,
someone burst out singing Taylor Swift.
Everyone joined in, and we realized it was
over. We had overcome a life test together
and we knew each other during the highs
and lows. Each of us had grown as indi-
viduals, but nothing felt better than coming
together - unified and collectively stronger

4B The Statement

Wednesday, September 11, 2013 // The Statement5B

membership flourishes with above 800 total
members enrolled each year since 2010.
Established in 1917, following the imple-
mentation of the National Defense Act of 1916,
the ROTC program has commissioned almost
500,000 officers since enrollment records
were documented starting1920.
The United States Army Cadet Command
determines the curriculum for the Army
ROTC programs at universities nationwide.
While many of the programs, training exer-
cises and classes have remained similar to or
the same as before 9/11, current members par-
ticipate in the program with more of a focus on
effectively using first aid and identifying the
enemy.
Operations Officer Wayne Doyle, who has
worked at the University since the late 1990s,
said he noticed the shift in the program's cur-
riculum to better prepare for finding non-
state actors - like the Taliban - that aren't
uniformed and easily identifiable in a crowd,
compared to the large unit formations the U.S.
military has traditionally faced.
"How can you fight them without causing
civil damage at the same time?" Doyle said. "It
takes a different mindset to do that than when
I grew up in the Army."
The goal is to create tactics that cause as
little harm to civilian populations as possible,
according to Doyle.
To pursue this objective, the Raiders team
- an extracurricular club that 40 cadets,
including some from Michigan State Univer-
sity - completed a mock night raid similar to
the one performed by the United States Navy
SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden. The club
completes different exercises each year, but
the objective is to allow cadets the opportu-
nity to execute a realistic Army operation on
their own. In this exercise, planned and led
by University cadets, they simulated calling in
for air fire, surveillance and wore night vision
goggles, among other tactics, to complete the
exercise.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Allana
Bryant, professor of military science and the
lead member of the cadre (or staff) advising
the program, the reenactment represents one
of multiple large training events. Within her
past two years involved in the program, Bry-
ant said it has expanded to new heights, and
will grow this year with their participation
in the Army Ten-Miler - a race that aims to
build Army spirit and maintain fitness goals -
in Washington, D.C. with two cadet teams and
one cadre team.
As for former ROTC graduates who now
serve in Iraq, Doyle said the program prepared
them well for the combat and day-to-day life
while deployed.
"From time to time I'll have lieutenants
write back to me from Iraq telling me this was
some of the best preparation they ever got for
combat in Iraq," Doyle said. "That was good
to hear, because we are teaching useful things
that do apply later on."
Bryant attended the U.S. Military Academy
herself and was deployed to Germany, Kuwait,
Haiti and around the country prior to coming
to Ann Arbor. As a student at West Point Mili-
tary Academy, Bryant and her classmates had
access to tangible necessities for the military,

like helicopters and shooting ranges.
The University program differs, however,
from the United States Military Academies
with members also experiencing a more tradi-
tional university lifestyle.
With this campus life, a University cadet's
ability to cope with more freedom could be a
cadet's downfall, or his or hers ascent to a dis-
ciplined attitude, Bryant said.
Learning to serve
When Engineering senior Matthew
Blanchard heard about the 9/11 attacks he was
in fourth grade. His teachers kept the news
a secret to maintain a calm environment and
continued with the usual activities for the day,
but the atmosphere was still tense.
Later, when Blanchard returned home
from school that day, he watched the news as
it played clips of the Twin Towers collapsing.
After visiting the World Trade Center a month
prior, he was unable to fully grasp the gravity
of the situation, just like many other Ameri-
cans.
Though he made the decision to join
ROTC only a few weeks before college began,

freshman and sophomore year - canoeing
along the Huron River - and last year rid-
ing a Black Hawk above campus, this year
was different. Living in close quarters at
Fort Custard, the battalion thrived - allow-
ing seniors to show incoming freshmen the
ropes, as well as teaching them one of the
most important emotional aspects of ROTC:
finding your purpose.
"If you give people purpose, they'll take to
it a lot better and bond a lot better," Blanchard
said. "This five-day orientation was absolute
gold for our program."
Blanchard wasn't the only one pleased
with the event. Doyle, Bryant and Park, all
among the ROTC cadre, lauded the orienta-
tion as a success. But it wasn't just the bond-
ing and prepping for the year that elicited
satisfaction: It was the seniors' ability to lead
the team more tactfully and passionately
than ever before.
The class, according to Doyle, firmly com-
mands the cadets, resulting in them garnering
more power and control within the program.
"They took it upon themselves, it's a really
neat thing to watch," Doyle said, adding that
Blanchard "has it in his mind that it's his bat-

"I learned to grow very passionate
about serving my country, serving other
people, serving the greater cause that
is Something greater than you and me.
Cap tai Albert Park

- where campus visitors often harassed vet-
erans and ROTC members - they are now not
only welcomed, but also celebrated.
"It definitely changed here on campus,"
Monts said. "I think that really changed after -
9/11, and I heard from cadets and midshipmen
that they're often stopped by people and had
people expressed their thanks for what they do
for the country."
On multiple occasions, Ann Arbor resi-
dents have paid for Doyle and Bryant's meals-
and greeted them with countless thanks and
appreciation.
"It's a difficult life," Bryant said of her
career. "It's alife whereyou sacrifice fromyour
own personal goals and dreams sometimes for
the sake of something else. The fact that we
weren't recognized or even in a negative light,
like it was in Vietnam, that was much more
difficult, so I'm very happy about the current
state of our culture."
For the soldiers, cadets, cadre and veterans,
individual progress and growth is not the only
measure of success - the goal is progress as a..
nation.
When asked to explain his purpose for join-
ing ROTC, Blanchard paused. After explain-
ing his leadership tactics while training the
freshmen at orientation, he thought about his
answer, eventually uttering each word of it
naturally.
"I want to progress myself as much as I
can and become as good quality of a leader as
I can," Blanchard said. "The military setting,
for me, has worked very well: I like the disci-
pline and the ability to make myself as good
as a person as I could possibly be. It will have
somewhere down the road some kind of posi-
tive impact."
While Blanchard is unsure of his future
in the military after his six years of service
following graduation, he understands the
rewards he has received from training in such
a high-stress, disciplined environment. No
matter if he serves until retirement, or goes
into engineering, his leadership skills have for-
ever changed.
For Park, the future is uncertain as well. He
has two years left serving on cadre for the Uni-
versity's program, and then he plans to return
to active service. While Park originally joined
the military to follow an 800-year-old family
tradition of service in the Korean military and,
now, the American military, his purpose to
serve has shifted.
Being commissioned to protect the coun-
try inspired a new purpose for Park: laying
the foundation for the military's future, and
protecting the ones that he loves from future
dangers.
"There was obviously something that had
to be done from the attacks on 9/11," Park
said. "What really compels me to work and
stay happy in my work is to make sure I did-"
the most I could do to rectify the inequity; do
my part so that other people didn't have to. I
get deployed to keep my friends and family
safe from subsequent attacks on American
soil. So that took a huge grasp on my heart,
actually. I learned to grow very passionate
about serving my country, serving other peo-
ple, serving the greater cause that is some-
thing greater than you and me"

aptain Albert Park kept a quote in
the back of his head while deployed
in Afghanistan in 2007. The quote
- said by Captain Ronald Speirs, a
World War II veteran played by Matthew Set-
tle in the HBO miniseries "Band of Brothers"
- motivated him while completing his duty as
a U.S. soldier.
"We're all scared. You hid in that ditch
because you think there's still hope. But Blithe,
the only hope you have is to accept the fact that
you're already dead. And the sooner you accept
that, the sooner you'll be able to function as
a soldier is supposed to function. Without
mercy. Without compassion. Without remorse.
All war depends on it."
In 2006, Park -- who was commissioned at
California State University, Fullerton in 2005
- served as the headquarters commandant

for a joint international post in Iraq. He spent you can't operate," Park said. "Every time that
most of his time maintaining logistics and you go out on patrol, you hope that you come
ensuring operations ran smoothly and with- back alive. You just take it day by day. You can't

what I operated off, because if you're scared, game was scheduled. The Big House was filled

to the brim, but the atmosphere was quite dif-
ferent than a normal game. Senior Vice Pro-
vost Lester Monts remembers the Army ROTC
cadets and midshipmen raising the flag at the
game while the national anthem played, elic-
iting an out-of-character noiseless response
from the audience.
"When the colors came out of the tunnel,
there was almost complete silence in the sta-
dium," Monts said. "I never heard the national
anthem sung with such gusto as I heard on
that particular day ... And that's just a descrip-
tion of their patriotism and appreciation for
what the military does for them and alike."
Since the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001, the enrollment in the University's ROTC
program has increased - with 555 total mem-
bers in 2001 growing to 898 in 2013. While
enrollment comes in peaks and valleys, its

Blanchard attended camps as a child with
plans to attend the U.S. Military Academy,
influenced by his dad who served in the mili-
tary himself. Now, 12 years later, Blanchard
serves as the University's Army ROTC cadet
battalion commander, the highest position
available for a cadet in the program.
This summer, Blanchard attended the
five-week Leadership Development Assess-
ment Course at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma,
Wash. - a mandatory program that com-
mission cadets participate in after their
junior year - with other rising seniors in
the program. There, Blanchard received a
rating of Excellent - the highest possible -
in addition to the coveted Recond badge, an
additional honor for top-performing cadets.
Upon returning to campus, Blanchard helped
lead the ROTC program's first five-day-long
orientation in late August at Fort Custard in
Battle Creek, Mich.
Blanchard described the few days as the
"best experience" he's had in ROTC. The
orientation gave 96 ROTC members - 42 of
whom are new to the program - an opportu-
nity to bond and progress as a unit.
Compared to brief bonding stints, his

While usually the level of bonding and inte-
gration with the freshmen and transfers takes
months to master, Bryant said the orientation
reached that level within a few days, resulting
in an impressive class of new and old members
for the start of the year.
Like Bryant, within a matter of five days,
Park saw immense improvements among the
battalion, especially with those who have
never been exposed to the military.
"It's so gratifying and extraordinary to
see their progress just in a matter of five
days - hell, just in a matter of three days,"
Park said. "This is all because of the efforts,
not only of us the cadre, but the seniors.
They've been in that program for two to four
years, and they are just regurgitating every-
thing they've learned into these cadets. It's
an amazing feat to see, actually."
