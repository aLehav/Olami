According to Public Policy 

professor Brendan Nyhan, fake 
news may have a more complex 
impact on the American public 
than 
experrts 
previously 

thought.

For the last several years, 

Nyhan has been working on 
a 
comprehensive 
study 
of 

U.S. fake news consumption, 
aiming to determine the scope 
and influence of fake news 
on the political leanings of 
Americans. Nyhan presented 
the 
facts 
and 
implications 

of 
his 
research 
Monday 

afternoon at the School of 
Information’s seminar “Who 
Reads Fake News?” About 
25 faculty members were in 
attendance. 
Media 
literacy 

has been of interest to many 
on campus in the wake of the 
2016 election. Last fall, the 
University offered a one-credit 
class on fake news to at help 

students dispel bias in the 
media, while computer science 
researchers 
are 
building 

an 
algorithm 
deisgned 
to 

detect fake news better than 
human reviewers. 

Introducing his research, 

Nyhan said he wanted to 
investigate 
the 
tangible 

University 
of 
Michigan 

expenditures 
on 
research 

reached a record high for 
the third year in a row in 
fiscal year 2018, and the school 
remained No. 1 in research 
volume 
across 
all 
public 

universities for the eighth 
year in a row, according to the 
National Science Foundation.

The 
report 
stated 
the 

volume of research at the 
University increased by 4.4 
percent from fiscal year 2017 
— from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 
2018, the volume of research 
at the University totaled $1.55 
billion.

The 
highest 
volume 
of 

research was at the Medical 
School, with $624.4 million 
dedicated 
to 
the 
school, 

followed by Engineering, LSA 
and the Institute of Social 
Research, all of which had 
research expenditures totaling 
greater than $100 million.

In a press release from 

Michigan 
News, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel said 
the No. 1 research volume 

With the renovation of the 

Michigan Union estimated to 
continue until early Winter 2020 
and renovation of the Central 
Campus Recreational Building 
beginning in 2021, these facilities 
will 
remain 
closed 
due 
to 

construction.

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents approved both of 
these 
multimillion-dollar 

renovation 
projects, 
most 

recently the CCRB in September. 
The temporary closing of these 
facilities affects students across 
campus, including those who 
worked in these locations.

The 

estimated $85,200,000 Michigan 
Union 
Renovation 
Project 

includes updates to the building’s 
exterior, increased student space, 
improved disability accessibility, 
an expansion to the Counseling 
and Psychological Services space 
and gender-neutral bathrooms. 
The CCRB project has a $150 
million budget and will create a 

new 200,000 square foot space for 
recreational sports and exercise.

The University Unions and 

Recreational Sports — a subset 
of the CCRB — are both large 
providers of student employment. 
Susan Pile, the senior director 
of the University Unions, said 
approximately 
100 
students 

worked at the Union, excluding 
the 
employees 
of 
leased 

operations such as Starbucks or 
Panda Express.

Every 
year, 
Student 

Life 
employs 
about 
4,000 

students in part-time, work-study, 
and temporary positions. These 
positions encompass customer 
services, rec sports, Michigan 
dining, information technology 
and more.

According 
to 
Director 
of 

Recreational Sports Mike Widen, 
Recreational Sports as a whole 
employs more than 600 students 
per year.

Student employees at the Union 

were informed of the renovation 
plans years before the building 
closed for construction.

Former Chief Official White House
Photographer takes on resistance 

NATALIE STEPHENS/Daily

Pete Souza, former Chief Official White House Photographer for the Obama Administration, signs copies of his book “Shade” after speaking at Rackham Auditorium 
Monday night. 

Before renovations, the Union held a job

SAYALI AMIN

Pete Souza speaks before sold-out Rackham audience on Obama versus Trump

 
On Jan. 22, 2017, two days after 

President 
Donald 
Trump 
was 

inaugurated into office, former 
White House photographer Pete 
Souza posted a picture on Instagram 
of President Barack Obama sitting 
on his desk with red curtains in the 
background with the caption “I like 
these drapes better than the new 
ones. Don’t you think?”

This photo came shortly after 

Trump redecorated his office with 
gold ornate drapes. After posting 
the picture, Souza recalls someone 
commented he was “dropping 
shade” at Trump.

 After looking “shade” up in the 

dictionary, he agreed.

“Yep,” Souza said. “That’s exactly 

what I’m doing.” 

 Souza’s series of “Shady” 

Instagram posts have since been 
compiled into a book titled “Shade: 
A Tale of Two Presidents,” which he 
discussed before a packed Rackham 
Auditorium 
Monday 
night 
at 

the University of Michigan. The 
photobook he presented consists of 
headlines referencing the Trump 
administration on the right side, 
juxtaposed by a photograph of the 
Obama Administration on the left.

 Over the course of the night, 

Souza highlighted several of his 
most pertinent moments with the 
Obama 
administration, 
ranging 

from iconic photographs of the 
former president with children to 
the worst day in Obama’s presidency 
to his hopes for the future.

 Souza’s report in photojournalism 

spans decades before being Obama’s 
White House photographer. In 
the early 1980s, he worked for the 
Chicago-Sun Times and in 1983 
became a junior White House 
photographer at the request of the 
Ronald Reagan administration’s 
senior photo editor. 

While Souza noted he wasn’t 

initially sure if he should take the 
position, he decided it would be an 
incredible opportunity to pass up.

 “I was not politically aligned 

with Reagan,” he said. “I was 
essentially being hired by the

White House photo editor, but 
I thought it would be a once in a 
lifetime opportunity to document 
a president for history, because 
that’s the primary function of that 
job is to create an archive that lives 
in perpetuity.”

 
While 
many 
of 
the 

circumstances 
were 
different 

when he was working for the 
Reagan administration compared 
to when he was working for the 
Obama 
administration, 
Souza 

acknowledged 
how 
vital 
the 

experience was for his career.

 “It taught me the inner 

workings of the White House,” 
he said. “I never thought that (I 
would) have another chance to 
be at the White House. But I said 
to myself if I did ever get a chance 
to go back, I would only go back 
as the chief photographer and I 

(would) make sure to get the best 
access that anyone has ever gotten 
and that I would try to create the 
best photographic archive that 
anybody have ever done.”

 Ensuring he received all-access 

to the president was incredibly 
important to Souza, and it was the 
pre-condition he gave to Obama 
upon 
accepting 
the 
position. 

This meant Souza received top-
security clearance, allowing him 
to document historic moments 
like the Osama Bin-Laden raid in 
the Situation Room. 

However, he noted gaining 

this trust was not easy at first, 
despite his four years of previous 
experience with Obama when he 
photographed him for the Sun-
Times.

 “You can have the president-

elect say you have access to 
everything but then as soon as 
you step in the Oval Office, things 
change,” Souza said. “So I had to 
earn the trust of the staff and the 

president. It took a few months 
but I think people understood 
that the president trusted me and 
was willing to give me access to 
these top secret meetings. It’s 
just something that you develop 
relationships with the people 
you’re photographing which is like 
a family type atmosphere.”

When 
reminiscing 
on 
his 

favorite 
photographs, 
Souza 

highlighted the smaller moments 
that revealed more about Obama 
as a human being.

 “One thing you can tell about 

a person is how they interact 
with other people,” Souza said. 
“(Obama) 
genuinely 
respects 

people from all walks of life. 
Whether it was the White House 
custodian or, you know, the chief 
of staff. And I think that that 
respect shows through in my 
photographs.” 

 
LSA 
junior 
Catharine 

Greenberg said she was excited 
to see hear more about working 

intimately with Obama.

 “What I appreciated 

most was the change to gain 
such an inside and intimate 
look into a presidency that 
meant so much to me and 
played such a crucial role in 
my life when I was growing 
up,” Greenberg said. 

 This 
sentiment 
was 

echoed 
by 
LSA 
junior 

Sydney 
Eisenberg, 
who 

lauded the genuine nature 
of Souza’s work. 

 “Souza 
made 
such 

a 
point 
to 
show 
the 

authenticity of every single 
photograph that he showed 
in 
his 
presentation 
or 

showed in his book. And 
he was so funny and it was 
a breath of fresh air from 
the 
Trump 
presidency, 

like getting this little kick-
back on Obama’s term,” 
Eisenberg said. 

 Souza also discussed 

that as chief White House 
photographer, he held the 
power of final review for all 
photographs released to the 
public. He wanted to ensure 
that if the wrong photo was 

released, the responsibility would 
fall solely on him.

 When asked if Souza released 

any pictures he wished he hadn’t, 
Souza chuckled and responded 
that “there were many.”

Specifically, 
he 
recalls 
a 

picture he released toward the 
end of Obama’s first term when 
the government was nearing a 
shutdown. The picture he took 
featured 
Obama 
surrounded 

by 10 to 12 advisers who were 
all male. This coincided with a 
story that there weren’t going to 
be enough women in the White 
House because Hillary Clinton 
was replaced with John Kerry as 
secretary of state. 

“The most prominent woman 

was being replaced by a man, so 
this was a very tone-deaf photo 
to put out. When in fact, as I like 
to point out to people, his top 
three national security advisers 
in the second term — the National 
Security 
adviser, 
the 
deputy 

National Security Adviser and 
the Homeland Security adviser — 
were all women,” Souza said. “But 
it was sort of a tone-deaf picture 
and it fed into this misconception 
of how he was staffing the second 
term.”

Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 

presentation, Souza argued his 
Instagram posts serve as a form 
of resistance against Trump’s 
presidency.

“I think I’m part of the ‘Truth 

Squad,’ you know, that we have 
a president that disrespects the 
Office of the Presidency the 
way he constantly lies to the 
American people, bullies people 
that disagrees with him, doesn’t 
believe 
his 
own 
intelligence 

agency, has love affairs with 
dictators instead of our allies, 
makes racist comments, treats 
women with reckless disregard at 
times and I could go on and on,” 
Souza said. 

“And for me, politics aside, 

I worked for both Reagan and 
Obama (and) both of them 
respected the Office of the

ranking demonstrates how 
the University and its schools 
are deeply engaged with the 
world off campus.

“The 
continued 
growth 

of the research productivity 
of our faculty is important 
evidence 
of 
the 
amazing 

strength of the University of 
Michigan,” Schlissel said. “I 
am proud that U-M research 
spans the breadth of our 
outstanding university and 
addresses many of society’s 
most pressing questions and 
challenges.”

The 
federal 
investment 

in 
the 
University 
totaled 

$852 
million 
last 
year, 

covering 55 percent of the 
University’s 
total 
volume 

of research over the last 

year. 
Federal 
investment 

encourages research at the 
University 
that 
supports 

public 
health, 
national 

security 
and 
economic 

competitiveness. 
The 
U.S. 

Department of Health and 
Human Services, which is 
consistently 
the 
greatest 

external sponsor of research 
at the University, granted 
$579 million to the University 
in fiscal year 2018. Internal 
research spending increased 
8 percent from fiscal year 
2017, totaling $524 million in 
fiscal year 2018. These trends 
are consistent with the 2018 
budget signed by President 
Donald Trump in March, 
which approved the greatest 
increase in allocation to U.S. 
research in a decade. 

Industry expenditures also 

increased 9 percent, totaling 
a record high of $109 million 
in fiscal year 2018.

The 
increase 
in 

expenditures led to a tangible 
increase 
in 
research 
in 

fiscal year 2018. According 
to the report, there were a 
record breaking 484 new 

inventions 
last 
year, 
the 

number of startups almost 
doubled to 21, and the Office 
of 
Technology 
Transfer 

signed 218 license and option 
agreements with companies 
hoping 
to 
commercialize 

these discoveries made at the 
University.

S. 
Jack 
Hu, 
University 

vice president for research, 
said the financial support 
allowed the University to 
produce a large amount of 
valuable research under the 
vision Research to Serve the 
World.

“As credit to our innovative 

campus 
community 
and 

strong external collaboration, 
the University of Michigan 
has conducted the largest 
volume of research of any 
public 
university 
in 
the 

United 
States 
for 
eight 

consecutive years,” Hu said 
in the University release. 
“This type of support allows 
us to advance knowledge, 
solve 
challenging 
societal 

problems, 
create 
new 

products and services that 
enhance 
quality 
of 
life, 

and support students and 
postdoctoral 
fellows 
in 

research and training.”

impacts fake news has on public 
political opinion.

“What I want to answer for 

you today are some questions like 
these: How prevalent was fake 
news consumption in 2016, what 
effects does have on people’s 
political attitudes and behavior 
and 
how 
are 
people 
being 

exposed to this dubious content 
in the first place?” Nyhan said.

During his lecture, Nyhan 

put a particular emphasis on 
his findings that contradicted 
popular 
perceptions 
of 
the 

influence of fake news.

“The 
average 
person, 

regardless 
of 
party, 
is 
not 

consuming this heavily skewed 
diet that many folks would 
predict,” Nyhan said. “There’s a 
relatively small subset of people 
who have strong predispositions 
to seek out and consume pro-
attitudinal information.”

This 
subset 
of 
people, 

as 
Nyhan 
explained, 
were 

identified through a cognitive 
reflection test, or a measure of 
one’s capability for thinking 
analytically about information 
presented to them.

According 
to 
Nyhan, 
his 

survey demonstrated this subset 
of people were far more likely 
to believe fake news sources, 
particularly when information 
was presented more than once.

“These (fake news) stories 

come to seem familiar,” Nyhan 
said. “You’ve seen fake news 
before, now you see it again, 
maybe you think it’s more likely 
to be true. We did observe a small 
but 
statistically 
measurable 

effect here.”

As 
Nyhan 
explained, 
the 

foundations of his work were 
influenced by the crucial 2016 
report “Social Media and Fake 
News in the 2016 Election,” 
written by political scientists 
Hunt 
Allcott 
and 
Matthew 

Gentzkow. According to Allcott 
and Gentzkow’s report, fake news 
doesn’t rely on an established 
audience or reputation to reach 
digital readers.

“Content 
can 
be 
relayed 

among users with no significant 
third 
party 
filtering, 
fact-

checking, or editorial judgment,” 
Allcott and Gentzkow wrote. “An 
individual user with no track 
record or reputation can in some 

cases reach as many readers as 
Fox News, CNN or the New York 
Times.”

Alain 
Cohn, 
an 
assistant 

professor 
at 
the 
School 
of 

Information with a focus on 
economics and moral decision 
making, said he was particularly 
interested in Nyhan’s points 
about the strategies of persuasion 
utilized by fake news sources. 
According to Cohn, Nyhan’s 
work intersects with his own in 
several capacities.

“I teach a course on persuasion 

and social influence,” Cohn said. 
“In my course I try to teach 
students how they are going to be 
persuaded in political contexts 
but also in consumer contexts.”

Though his analysis of fake 

news impact presented serious 
implications, Nyhan contended 
fake news had a central impact 
on the outcome of the 2016 
election. As he explained, the 
impact of fake news is far more 
complex than many make it out 
to be.

“It’s pretty hard to tell a 

story about how vote choice 
was affected by fake news when 
the people you would expect 
to be the most unsure about 
which candidate to vote for are 
consuming very little fake news,” 
Nyhan said. “It really challenges 
this simplistic account of the 
2016 election.”

Cohn, on the other hand, 

worries 
fake 
news 
could 

have 
unforeseen 
yet 
drastic 

consequences.

“Those who consume fake 

news have already made up their 
opinion,” Cohn said. “However, 
if they become more extreme, 
that 
might 
be 
dangerous. 

There are other ways fake 
news consumption may affect 
society, even if it’s just among a 
minority.” 

Though 
faculty 
made 
up 

the majority of the audience 
Monday 
afternoon, 
students 

are also taking up the question 
of fake news, especially in 
the context of social media. LSA 
sophomore Mackenzie Freeman, 
a communication studies major, 
told The Daily in an interview 
last month fake news is an 
issue that, if left undetected, 
could alter the efficacy of news 
altogether.

“This is really problematic 

because people see the news as 
being able to express the truth 
and that feature is being taken 
away,” she said. 

the Michigan Union renovation 
so we actively informed the 
campus community, including 
student employees, over those 
years,” Pile wrote in an email 
interview.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Nick 

Martire worked at the Union 
Starbucks for about seven months. 
Martire said he was aware of the 
closing before his employer told 
him.

“While my employer did tell 

me about the Union renovation, I 
knew about it already when they 
told me,” Martire wrote in an 
email interview.

Because Starbucks was a 

leased operation, Martire said 
he did not receive University 
assistance in finding his new 
job at the Alumni Association. 
But Pile said for those students 
employed by the University in 
the Union, alternate placements 
were arranged.

“In many cases, the students 

now work at the League and 
Pierpont,” Pile wrote. “Any 
student 
who 
was 
working 

in the Union and wanted 

another position was given that 
opportunity.”

Pile said the Union also 

hosted a job fair for students 
employed 
by 
non-University 

operations within the Union to 
assist in finding another job. 

As for the upcoming CCRB 

renovation, Widen said student 
employees were informed of the 
renovations through meetings 
and email announcements after 
the Regents voted on it in 
September, 
though 
many 

were aware of the project 
from 
other 
means. 
Similar 

to the Union, time was given 
before the start of the project 
to allow for the necessary 
changes of employment.

“The CCRB isn’t scheduled 

to close for replacement for 
two 
more 
years,” 
Widen 

wrote in an email interview. 
“As we get closer to that time, 
we will make adjustments to 
our hiring.”

Widen said students who 

may be working at the CCRB 
in two years will work with 
Recreational Sports to find 
alternate placement.

“We have other facilities 

like IMSB, NCRB, Sports 
Coliseum, Elbel Field, and 
Mitchell Field that all need 

student 
staffing,” 
Widen 

wrote. “In addition, we have 
a number of programs that 

need student employees as 
well, e.g. Group-X, Personal 
Training, Intramural Sports, 
Club 
Sports, 
Adventure 

Leadership.”

LSA junior Mikaela Bradley 

currently works at both the 
CCRB and the Intramural 
Sports Building. In an email 
interview, Bradley said she 
will no longer be a student 
at the University when the 
renovations begin; however 
she expected if she still 
were a student, she would 

try to continue working for 
Recreational Sports.

“If the CCRB was closing 

earlier, I would definitely try 
to ensure all of my shifts were 
at the IMSB so that I could 
still work with recreational 
sports,” Bradley wrote. 

Bradley also added some 

students 
are 
under 
the 

assumption that renovations 
will be occurring very soon.

“A lot of students that don’t 

work at rec sports seem to 
think the renovations are 
going to happen much sooner 
than they are,” Bradley wrote. 
“I have had several patrons 
ask me when the CCRB is 
closing and they are often 
surprised that the remodeling 
is still a few years away.”

Widen added Recreational 

Sports has experience with 
renovations over the past few 
years.

“We’ve gone through this 

same 
process 
of 
making 

adjustments 
for 
student 

employees 
recently 
with 

the IMSB (2015-2016) and 
the NCRB (2017-2018) were 
each closed for their own 
renovations,” Widen wrote. 

checked for correctness.

Senate Assembly Chair Neil 

Marsh expressed his belief that 
the resolution is something more 
abstract, that supporting CSG 
would not take away from the 
faculty assembly.

“I see this (resolution) as 

being fairly non-controversial 
and its heart is in the right 
place,” he said. “I don’t see any 
particular downside to us saying 
we support (their) resolution 
once it’s been passed.”

Next, the assembly welcomed 

Jerry 
May, 
University 
vice 

president 
for 
development. 

One of the largest projects for 
the Office of Development, the 
Victors for Michigan campaign, 
which began in 2011 and is 
coming to its close, has raised 
over $5 billion and is the 
most 
successful 
fundraising 

campaign in University history. 
May, 
who 
announced 
his 

upcoming retirement last spring, 
explained his role of overseeing 
all fundraising activities and 
answered 
the 
questions 
of 

assembly members.

Members 
of 
the 
assembly 

mentioned 
many 
University 

programs 
receive 
consistent 

funding, like the Ross School 
of Business, while other areas 
needing improvement do not 
recieve 
as 
many 
donations. 

Though donors cannot be told 
where to give their money, May 
said, many decide to donate to 
multiple areas instead of just 
one.

“I’m 
a 
huge 
believer 
in 

multiple 
relationships 
in 

multiple areas, and not having 
one development officer … that 
hoards your relationship with a 
donor,” May said. “What I find 
is the more (an individual) is 
exposed to the breadth of the 
university, the more likely they 
are to give to more than just 
their one degree.”

University 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert 
then 
spoke 
to 
the 

assembly, highlighting the recent 

introduction of parental leave 
benefits for University faculty 
and staff. Philbert discussed 
how it’s a joint responsibility 
to child rear, and this benefit 
will make the University a more 
attractive place to work.

“In a time where there are 

lots of issues that divide us, this 
is one of those that unites us,” 
Philbert said. “We will support 
the members of our community 
who need time to bond with 
their children.”

The 
meeting 
concluded 

with questions from members 
of the assembly to Philbert, 
primarily 
regarding 
the 

Office 
of 
Institutional 

Equity amid criticism of the 
office’s 
sexual 
misconduct 

investigations, especially within 
the School of Music, Theater 
& Dance. OIE’s annual report 
released earlier this year found 
more reports were filed with 
the office, though the number of 
investigations dropped. Philbert 
voiced support for the policy and 
process as a whole.

“I’ve 
heard 
concerns 

about the length of time it 
takes to complete some OIE 
investigations,” Philbert said. 
“We’re always working to ensure 
that those investigations are fair, 
thorough and timely.”

The student sexual misconduct 

policy 
dictates 
OIE 
should 

strive to complete investgations 
within 60 days of their filing —
anecdotal 
evidence 
reported 

by The Daily found, however, 
students 
were 
waiting 
from 

five to six months at times for 
responses 
to 
their 
reports. 

Philbert 
said 
some 
factors 

delay the completion of certain 
investigations, 
and 
opened 

the 
conversation 
to 
include 

suggestions from the assembly 
to make this process more 
efficient and effective. Philbert 
concluded 
the 
meeting 
by 

explaining the implementation 
of 
mandatory 
online 
sexual 

misconduct training for faculty 
members in the years going 
forward.

T

he Bird scooters that 
dropped in Ann Arbor 
this 
September 
and 
have 
continued 
to 
flock around campus 
are really akin to 
the common pigeon. 
They 
populate 
the 
sidewalks in droves 
and weave in and 
out 
of 
crowds 
of 
pedestrian students. 
They 
have 
their 
typical nesting areas, 
practically 
stacked 
on top of each other 
outside of the MLB, Ross and 
other places that are just a bit 
too far from the other side of 
campus. City officials have 
tried to control them, but still 
they zip and zoom in every 
direction. They have become, 
at the same time an exciting 
new mode of transportation 
and a menace to society, but 
what Bird riders may not 
realize is how the scooters 
might be feasting on their 
data.
Bird, a startup out of Santa 
Monica, connects its electric 
scooter service to a free app 
on your phone. Once you have 
downloaded the app, uploaded 
your 
payment 
information 
and a snapped a picture of 
your driver’s license, you are 
ready to ride. The rides cost 
$1 per ride plus $0.15 per 
minute and have become a 
source of transportation for 
the awkward “last mile” of 
the urban commute where a 
destination is too far to walk 
yet not far enough to drive. 
Bird’s environmental mission 
is to provide cities with a 
clean, car-free transportation 
alternative.
Though a majority of the 
data 
security 
issues 
that 
I 
have 
written 
about 
are 
tied to the internet and the 
regulation 
of 
firms 
that 
operate on the digital sphere, 
with the prospect of “smart 
cities” and data-driven urban 
planning, it is important that 
we turn our attention to “the 
internet of things.” Simply 
put, this concept is the idea 
of connecting any and every 
possible device to the internet 
to 
streamline 
its 
use 
for 
consumers and more easily 
configure the data for the 
companies that provide the 
service.
Bird doesn’t just collect data 
from mobile phones, however 
— the scooters themselves 
are prodigious data collection 
machines, 
specifically 
for 
highly valuable location data. 
The company automatically 
collects 
the 
precise 
GPS 
location of its scooters, the 
routes riders take and the 
rental status of its scooters. 
The information collected is 
also directly associated with 
a user’s individual account, 
making it possible for Bird 
to “personalize” content for 
a specific user in the form of 
reports, recommendations and 
feedback according to user 
preferences.

In its Privacy Policy, Bird 
makes 
sure 
to 
distinguish 
between 
the 
personalized 
content that they 
provide 
based 
on 
individual 
users 
and 
the 
“anonymous 
or 
aggregate 
information” 
that 
they are able to use 
for “any purpose.” 
The 
personalized 
content establishes 
the 
connection 
between Bird and 
its 
e-scooter 
enthusiasts, 
however, this aggregate data 
is also of huge value to cities, 
developers 
and 
businesses 
vying to apply the analysis 
of 
usage 
patterns 
to 
the 
development of their smart 
city initiatives. The wording 
of “any purpose” also implies 
the wide scope of Bird’s ability 
to use its data in any way it 
wants.

Because Bird claims to be 
playing a role in shaping the 
green cities of tomorrow, it 
should be as open as possible 
with its aggregate data. It 
has actually been pretty good 
about this, providing cities 
with its GovTech platform 
that monitors how citizens 
are 
using 
the 
scooters 
and putting forth possible 
solutions 
for 
unwanted 
activity. 
For 
example, 
geofencing will notify riders 
of locations in a city where 
Birds 
are 
prohibited, 
and 
the Community Mode allows 
individuals to report incidents 
of unsafe activity or poor 
parking.
We should also stop and 
think, despite the supposed 
inherent value of Bird’s data, 
whether scooters really are 
a viable alternative for “last 
mile” 
transportation. 
From 
a sustainability perspective, 
riding 
an 
electric 
scooter 
uses only 1 to 2 percent of 
the carbon dioxide emissions 
that driving a car the same 
distance does. The individual 
consumer 
choice 
is 
never 
that 
simple, 
though, 
and 
Bird introduces extraneous 
costs that the average rider 
doesn’t think about. All the 
scooters have to be rounded 
up by trucks overnight and 
charged by workers with their 
own vehicles. In addition, 
these fun new scooters might 
be replacing lower emission 
options 
such 
as 
walking, 
riding a bike or using public 
transportation. There is just 
not enough data right now 

beyond the extrapolations of 
e-scooter companies to judge 
their long-term environmental 
impact.
Beyond 
aggregate 
data, 
regulators should also curtail 
the amount of unnecessary 
personal 
information 
that 
Bird is collecting from its 
users. Bird uses persistent 
data tracking to record every 
move riders make from the 
moment they get on a scooter 
to the moment they get off, 
meaning that if you took a 
scooter to a protest, a religious 
service or a sensitive medical 
appointment, 
the 
scooter 
would know. Bird is operating 
under the assumption that 
people 
want 
extremely 
personalized experiences on 
their scooters, when in fact 
most riders just use their 
services to get from point A to 
point B.
The 
company 
could 
still de-identify all of the 
precise GPS data and use it 
to achieve the goal of a city 
with fewer cars, but it would 
be hard to convince Bird 
executives to do this because 
the 
data 
would 
suddenly 
lose 
commercial 
value 
to 
advertisers. There is no need 
for the Birds of the future to 
suggest possible destinations 
based on my preferences; I 
am just trying to get to class. 
The data that Bird collects 
might also fall into the hands 
of governments attempting 
to use the technology to 
surveil their citizens. Bird 
says loosely that it shares 
its data based on the “good-
faith” belief that such action 
is necessary to comply with 
the law, leaving this transfer 
of personal data including 
photos and GPS tracking up to 
its discretion.
It also seems that Bird 
doesn’t 
prioritize 
data 
protection 
overall. 
In 
the 
brief section on “How we 
protect your information” in 
its Privacy Policy, Bird says it 
takes measures to protect user 
information while also forcing 
the 
user 
to 
acknowledge 
that Bird cannot guarantee 
the 
transfer 
of 
personal 
information and that it is all 
“at your own risk.” Essentially 
Bird reserves the right to do 
whatever it wants with the 
information you provide, and 
if anything goes wrong it’s 
your problem. The rules are a 
bit more stringent concerning 
international users, especially 
for European Union data on 
subjects 
living 
under 
the 
umbrella of the General Data 
Protection Regulation.
As with any tech startup 
claiming to offer revolutionary 
new services for cheap, the 
value and concern lies in 
data. Scooters are fun, but 
the data security challenges 
surrounding 
them 
could 
become a pest.

W

e lay on the carpet 
floor, our beds, the 
couch, sit around 
the table and sigh. 
Oh, how we long 
to 
be 
in 
loving 
relationships. 
It’s 
that time of year 
when my friends and 
I fantasize about the 
people who we wish 
to meet, the ones 
we are longing after 
and those who were 
just not right for us. 
When will we meet 
someone new who will change 
and impact the rest of our 
lives as we know it? Recently, 
I realized I spend a lot of time 
having conversations with my 
friends about the existing or 
nonexistent romantic partners 
in our lives. 
Sometimes, it’s really fun, 
and we talk about all the 
good things happening with 
those we are seeing or how 
we love our single life. Other 
times, we laugh at each other’s 
horror stories and cry over the 
heartbreak. But either way, my 
friends and I are constantly 
asking 
each 
other 
about 
each other’s love lives and 
relationships or lack thereof. 
This 
Thanksgiving 
Break, 
it was a common part of the 
conversation when catching 
up with friends and family. 
It almost came up more than 
how school was going, my 
social life or my career and 
post-graduation plans.
I wasn’t shocked my friends 
and family brought it up, 
because I often ask them the 
same. 
There 
is 
something 
exciting 
about 
learning 
about the emotional lives of 
our loved ones. But people 
tend to only pique interest 
in this type of relationship. 
For example, wouldn’t it be 
ridiculous if my family or 
friends talked about my best 
friendships with the same 
seriousness as they would 
about romantic relationships? 
For 
instance, 
imagine 
if 
they asked if my friend was 
meeting my emotional needs, 
how our communication was 
and if I saw our friendship 

long-term. It sounds pretty 
silly, and it shows how much 
interest we have in romantic 
relationships.
Our 
society 
highly 
values 
these 
romantic 
relationships, 
and lately I have 
been noticing the 
pressure we get from 
our media to have 
these 
experiences. 
There 
is 
the 
classic narrative in 
romantic comedies 
and 
princess 
stories 
of 
heteronormativity, where a 
man shows up solving all of 
the woman’s problems and 
they can now be happy for the 

rest of their lives. This could 
be a driving force in why 
women feel like they should 
want to be in a relationship 
and why we are all so obsessed 
with 
talking 
about 
these 
relationships. 
Women 
have 
been taught to think being 
in a relationship is going to 
complete us and make our 
lives better. We are taught we 
can only see our worth if there 
is a man present, which gives 
men a lot of power.
Romantic 
and 
sexual 
relationships are important 
because they can add some 
positivity to life, like having 
someone who is there for you, 
who lifts you up and is your 
partner at the end of the day. 
But one’s problems are not 
going to be solved because one 
now has this partner. Also, in 
romantic comedies the female 
characters are very dependent 
on 
the 
male 
characters. 
Our media needs to portray 
confident independent women 

who make things happen and 
do not wait for a man. Women 
who put their needs, wants, 
passions and careers before 
the subject of their love life.
I know this is a common 
feminist rant about seeing 
more 
complex 
storylines 
for women and created by 
women. But the only way we 
are going to see a change in 
the content that is created 
is 
if 
these 
storylines 
are 
created by the people who 
actually 
experience 
them. 
Ultimately, if men with the 
power are creating the media 
women consume, they are 
fostering 
this 
obsession 
with relationships and the 
expectation 
of 
what 
we 
should be. We need to see 
more storylines about young 
women who do more than just 
fall in love. Women deserve 
to learn from a narrative 
that their interests, passions, 
careers and who they are as 
a person are so much more 
important than if they are in a 
relationship.
I see my friends and me 
falling into toxic conversations 
during which we discuss our 
relationships 
first 
before 
we even bring up anything 
about ourselves. We all have 
other things happening in 
our lives that have so much 
more importance, which we 
should be highlighting and 
sharing with one another. 
Relationships are crucial and 
fun to talk about, but so are 
our friendships; these should 
be equally as important to our 
romantic relationships.
This 
cuffing 
season, 
let’s try to not get caught 
up in the toxic messages 
and 
conversations 
about 
relationships. Let’s focus on 
bettering ourselves. Let’s talk 
about our present and future 
goals, passions, interests and 
careers. When you are ready 
to be with someone, make 
sure that they complement 
the already amazing life you 
have and the person you are 
without them.

GODMODE

The 
literary 
critic 
Jesse 

McCarthy’s 
essay 
“Notes 

On Trap” combines musical 
analysis with cultural history in 
a dizzying, nearly-encyclopedic 
account of a now-ubiquitous 
genre of music. He writes 
that, “Trap is the only music 
that sounds like what living in 
contemporary 
America 
feels 

like. It is the soundtrack to 
the dissocialized subject that 
neoliberalism 
made.” 
While 

reading, I was reminded of 
the 2014 piece “We Are All 
Very Anxious” by the English 
collective We Are Plan C. 
The 
essay’s 
thesis 
is 
that 

anxiety is a “reactive affect” 
to contemporary life, which is 
increasingly defined by political 
instability 
and 
post-truth 

politics, as well as pervasive 
mass surveillance and social 
fragmentation.

McCarthy 
points 
out 

something 
obvious: 
If 
it’s 

difficult to say how we feel 
in public, the music of recent 
years has been telling us how 
we feel for a while. It works 
like this not only in content but 
also in form, in format. Music 
is better than almost any other 
art form at capturing the kind 
of placeless feelings that one 
gets from seeing increasingly 
horrifying and ludicrous news, 
logging on and off of dream-like 
social media simulacra, seeing 
people 
crowdsourcing 
funds 

for essential healthcare and 
negotiating the baffling array 
of techno-capital contrivances 
that 
mediate 
transportation, 

interaction 
with 
strangers, 

interaction 
with 
colleagues, 

interaction with close friends 

and loved ones. It’s a public 
secret that a lot of us are 
incapable of dealing with all 
of this, and the popular music 
records this — it practically 
trips over itself to tell us what 
we already know.

Consider “raingurl” by Yaeji. 

The beat is miniaturized to the 
size of mobile streaming, almost 
a scale model of itself. The kick 
drum is an obscure thump, 
routed through plastic, and 
the percussion is a brittle stage 
whisper. Everything inessential 
is discarded or diminished to 
the size of her languid, halting 
vocals — she mumbles, and 
the rest of the instrumental 
mumbles with her. Her drum 
patterns codify the tendency of 
dance music to end up mostly 
accompanying 
stationary 

head-nodding while holding a 
drink (and more often: walking 
somewhere, sitting on the bus, 
studying, a constant distraction). 
The beat in “raingurl” does not 
move forward, it rather levitates 
and rotates like a sprinkler 
head. A song from the same 
EP, “drink I’m sippin on,” does 
much of the same thing to a 
sort of bubble-wrapped trap 
music. The drum pattern has the 
gliding fluency of trap but none 
of the momentum. It instead 
sways pendulously side to side, 
directing the listener’s attention 
to the ceiling.

Sasha Geffen writes in his 

review of Yaeji’s EP2 that the 
songs “remind you of the limits 
of dancefloor transcendence, 
and the strange, lonely pocket 
you fall into when you aim for 
transcendence and miss.” It 
might be more appropriate to 
say that the songs take that 
pocket as a starting point: 
You’re disillusioned from the 
moment you walk into the club. 

The definitive move in Yaeji’s 
lyrics is the abrupt pivot from 
rumination 
to 
half-hearted 

partying and back again, and 
her 
production 
style 
sticks 

definitively 
to 
the 
former. 

Her remix of the Australian 
producer Mall Grab’s track 

“Guap” 
is 
emblematic. 
Her 

deadpan delivery completely 
changes the energy of the 
20-plus years of accumulated 
references to “the club” that 
she has inherited, and the 
production style is more moody 
than anything else. With her 
voice, the repeated line “Every 
time I walk in I feel the same 
/ In the shadows, life is just a 
game” loses any insider allure 
and becomes almost a plea.

Her music is, in summary, 

presenting 
an 
internal 
and 

an external state at the same 
time, presenting the public 
narrative of nihilistic luxury 
and 
accumulation 
while 

also showing private doubts, 
dejection, rumination, anxiety. 
“raingurl” prickles like doubt, 
moves with a weird fixedness. 
It is music of the moment, music 
that moves into the future only 
because there’s nowhere else to 
go.

 MUSIC NOTEBOOK

I read a tweet once that said: 

“Rape isn’t always bloody and 
violent, it can be silent, slow 

and enacted by your friends 
and family.” There’s something 
shockingly 
impactful 

about pulling the rug from 
underneath your feet, falling 
face-first into the hardwood 
panels of reality and truth. And 
that’s basically what Vanessa 
Place does in her book, “You 
Had to Be There: Rape Jokes,” 
based on a live performance 
in which she straight up tells 
rape jokes for the entirety 
of a 45-minute show. As an 

artist, writer and criminal 
appellate attorney, Place has 
encountered and defended the 
appeals of countless felons, 
namely sex offenders. She has 
mastered the art of hitting 
the hardwood floor — nothing 
to brace herself with, just a 
free-fall into the cold, hard 
reality of rape, pedophilia and 
sadomasochism.

At this point, you’re probably 

wondering, “Why rape jokes?” 
Because 
that’s 
definitely 

what I was wondering. What 
could be funny in the slightest 
about rape? It feels inhuman, 
sick, twisted to even consider 
cracking a smirk at a single joke 
regarding rape or pedophilia 
or sexual violence. But here 
you have it, folks.

Humor 
serves 
many 

purposes, and when dealt with 
correctly for even the most 
sensitive, 
too-hot-to-touch 

topics, it can be an artistically- 
and politically-potent piece 
of work. Place’s humor is 
designed to remove the veneer 
that has concealed our failure 
to deal with the subject of rape 
and sexual violence effectively 
and appropriately. It is a piece 
that forces you to “confront 

the horror of rape” without 
having anywhere to hide or 
escape back into the comfort 
of disregard for the more 
perverse things life brings to 
the dinner table. And in each 
of Place’s shows she witnesses 
the guilty giggles and shameful 
smirks that escape the taut 
lips 
of 
countless 
audience 

members. And this is where the 
activation of art and language 
comes into play; words that are 
fraught with humor, sickness 
and 
dismay 
find 
a 
home 

inside the dustiest corners of 
our minds. What I’m really 
trying to say is that Place, as 
Slovenian philosopher Slavoj 
Žižek writes, “bitch-slaps you 
into consent.”

Place 
devours 
cultural 

schisms, 
splintering 
them 

wide open for the world’s eye 
to behold. She asserts that rape 
culture “is our culture” and it 
is most exposed in our “media-
driven” society today. She 
starts with fairytales (“Call 
me ‘Prince Charming,’ but 
there’s nothing more kissable 
than a teenage girl in a coma”) 
and ends with pornography 
(“‘Barely legal’: when ‘almost 
underage’ sounds a bit too

Nov. 2, 2018

Ann Arbor, Mich., a college city 

dominated by millennials, rises 
to the occasion of each and every 
new millennial trend to take 
off, leaving students (and their 
Instagrams) content with the hip 
place we call home. I’ve been one 
to drink the Kool Aid — or eat 
the fancy avocado toast — buying 
into all the the food trends that 
have taken off in Ann Arbor in 
the past few years. With students 
promoting the restaurants and 
eateries in Ann Arbor that are the 
most hip, have the best brunch, 
are the best looking and the most 
healthy and unique, more and 
more restaurants are popping 
up offering vegan, gluten free, 
vegetarian and “clean eating” 
options. Additionally, more and 
more places are fostering their 
menus and vibe to match the 
millennial aesthetic, one that 
seems to stem from a desire to 
constantly be connected, and to 
share photos with the world.

The millennial generation lives 

in a world where the internet 
is a click away at all times. Our 
constant link to technology pushes 
us to reach for an expensive açaí 
bowl over a two dollar candy bar 
for two reasons. First, we have 
access to the internet in ways no 
generation has ever had before. 
We have a constant stream of 
information at our fingertips 
telling us about the healthiest food 
choices, the trendiest ingredients 
and recipes and what we should 
be eating. Between Tasty videos 
on Facebook, and quick articles 
from Buzzfeed, it’s impossible to 
ignore.

Second, we live surrounded 

by restaurants and cafes that 
are pushing themselves to foster 
that 
millennial 
aesthetic, 
to 

create food, beverages and an 
atmosphere that millennials will 
find worthy of their Snapchat, 
Instagram and Twitter feeds. The 
millennial aesthetic stems from 
a desire to Instagram, Snapchat, 
tweet and text our way from place 
to place, making ourselves look hip 
and trendy online. So what came 
first, the trendy restaurant or the 
Instagram pics? I wonder often if 
restaurants are simply catering to 
the fact that students will come in 
dozens if they have an Instagram-
worthy aesthetic. While we go 
out to eat to be present, many of 
us are caught up in the “phone 
eats first” mantra, and won’t take 
a bite of food until we snap the 
perfect picture. I’m guilty of this 
myself — constantly trying to 
take the perfect Instagram photo 

before I try the food I’ve ordered, 
or ordering what I think will turn 
out the most photogenic.

These notions are, in recent 

years, 
being 
replicated 
and 

promoted all throughout Ann 
Arbor. If your Instagram feed 
isn’t 
cluttered 
with 
pictures 

of Freds’s açaí bowls, poke 

bowls, avocado toasts (and/or a 
Boomerang of a fork carefully 
slicing into a poached egg, so that 
all your followers can watch the 
yolk dribble down the side of the 
avocado and cascade over the 
edge of the toasted bread — don’t 
act like you don’t know exactly 
what this is) it probably isn’t 
Sunday. Brunch is for the internet 
these days — we’re going out to eat 
to get the perfect picture.

If Snapchat and Instagram 

aren’t filled with photos of 
perfectly swirled colliders from 
Rod’s, 
aesthetically 
pleasing 

brunch from Sava’s, Angelos, 
Avalon and Afternoon Delight, 
if 
you’re 
not 
documenting 

every moment of Korean BBQ 
at Tomukun, your latte at Lab, 
your flight of ice cream at Blank 
Slate, your drunk Hippie Hash at 
Fleetwood — did you really go?

The wait at Freds on any given 

weekend morning can be up to 
an hour, with students waiting 
on the street for their picture 
perfect avocado toast and tumeric 
latte. For many students on this 
campus, that $12 avocado toast 
on the clean white plate with the 
adorable interior decor inside of 
Fred’s is worth it. For millennial 
foodies, it’s no longer about 

the cheapest, easiest or most 
convenient option. Students are 
seeking out the best ingredients, 
the 
healthier 
and 
trendier 

options — and the best looking 
choices. Willing to shell out the 
extra dollars because all of these 
restaurants are taking the time to 
work on presentation and to cater 
to what we’re all going after. The 
commercial world of food has 
evolved just as technology and 
social media has, changing for 
the tiny iPhone screen, the Yelp 
reviewer, the Snapchatter and the 
millennial foodie alike.

Ann Arbor, a city of college 

students and millennials, is the 
greatest example of this millennial 
foodie world. Ann Arbor has two 
thriving vegan restaurants in 
Kerrytown alone: Detroit Filling 
Station and The Lunch Room, 
which not only promote healthy 
eating, but are also consistently 
jam-packed. They are both not 
cheap due to their high quality, but 
students don’t seem to mind. On 
most afternoons and weekends, 
both restaurants are full from 
open to close. Poke and açaí places 
are opening around the clock 
— restaurants around town are 
popping up with cauliflower pizza 
crust the minute it hits the shelves 
in the local Trader Joe’s and 
students get to talking about how 
trendy it is to eat a pizza made out 
of a vegetable.

So what has pushed the college 

student — the modern foodie — 
to treat food as such a large part 
of their agenda? Larger than any 
generation before? Is it a problem, 
or is it inevitable?

As much as I wish we could all 

go back to the times our parents 
would take our phones at the 
dinner table, or to the far off time 
where there was no technology 
bleeding into our meals at all, 
that simply isn’t realistic. But 
the obsession with food photos, 
going out to eat at the trendiest 
most Insta-worthy spots and our 
iPhone cameras may be inhibiting 
our ability to share real, human 
moments in a world where we 
seem to be losing more and more 
of those by the day.

At the end of the day, social 

media 
and 
technology 
have 

become so wildly used and 
necessary in every facet of life 
that it is impossible to literally 
shut down at any point during 
the day. Suddenly, with the ability 
to Instagram your latest brunch 
spot, 
Snapchat 
your 
favorite 

cocktail at your favorite bar and 
tweet about how #amazing the 
most recent vegan ice cream 
flavor at Blank Slate is … Everyone 
has food on their mind, and in 
their camera roll.

The music of 

recent years has 

been telling us 

how we feel for 

a while

creepy.”)

The 
repetition 
of 
crude 

text 
and 
content 
compile 

into 
a 
monotonous 
chant 

that dominates the reader’s 
emotional and mental safety 
net. In a way, her jokes end 
up mirroring the structure 
of the act of rape itself — “a 
violent discharge of repressed 
sexuality.” 
Even 
the 
term 

rape has been overworked 
and sensitized into ambiguity. 
“Sex” is a term we all know 
— even the word “fuck” is 
graspable, 
risky 
but 
not 

explosive 
— 
but 
“rape” 

requires taking a plunge into 
uncharted territory.

It’s not all meant to be 

shocking, though. Most jokes 
are rooted in a statistical 
reality 
we 
are 
all 
too 

sickeningly 
familiar 
with. 

Some jokes that prompted this 
response for me include: “Only 
6 percent of all rape cases end 
in conviction. Anyone else like 
those odds?” and, “I live for 
sex. Unlike my victims, who 
have sex to live,” followed by: 
“If God doesn’t need a woman’s 
consent to get her pregnant, 
why the fuck should I?”

It’s easy to see why Place’s 

work is, more often than not, 
considered too controversial 
to be performed live, but Place 
is merely stripping away the 
boundaries 
of 
art 
making 

and doing what many artists 
are too afraid to do. By being 
overtly politically incorrect 
she has unlimited legroom to 
challenge the unduly sensitive 
political landscape we have 

constructed 
today. 
Place’s 

humor 
serves 
a 
different 

purpose, when telling rape 
jokes, than that of “Tosh.0” 
host Daniel Tosh or male 
comics like Dave Chappelle. 
Instead of allowing people to 
look down at their feet when 
the topic of rape arises, Place’s 
work forces readers to be wide 
awake to a subject matter 
that has been stashed away 
for so long. And she does this 
by surfacing the voices of the 
convicted, 
those 
outcasted 

from the perimeters of human-
coded normality and sanity.

Place’s work is risky from 

start to finish, but that is what 
makes it so uneasily potent. To 
Place, “Art is violence, to time 
and space and representation.” 
Her work fully lends itself 
to risk because it thrives on 
tension through antagonism 
and the brutal honesty of 
the darker shades life has to 
offer. Some denounce Place 
as racist, some say she is a 
rape sympathizer, but I would 
rather appoint her as an artist 
with no limits or bounds in a 
subject matter that is often 
erroneously 
and 
blindly 

suppressed into nothingness.

SHOWTIME

In June 2015, two inmates 

escaped from the maximum-
security Clinton Correctional 
Facility in the small upstate 
New York town of Dannemora. 
The subsequent manhunt for 
the two men caused schools 

to cancel class, highways to 
close and ultimately accrued a 
cost of over 20 million dollars. 
The 
investigation 
revealed 

a story much more complex 
and bizarre than originally 
thought.

Ben 
Stiller 
tackles 
this 

stranger-than-fiction 
story 

in “Escape at Dannemora.” 
Benicio Del Toro (“Sicario: Day 
of the Soldado”) and Paul Dano 
(“Okja”) play the two escapees, 
Richard Matt and David Sweat. 
Both are convicted murderers 
who were placed in a block 
in the prison that granted 
them extra privileges such 
as 
televisions 
and 
cooking 

stations. Their escape is aided 
by 
Tilly 
Mitchell 
(Patricia 

Arquette, “Boyhood”), a prison 
worker who is romantically 
and sexually involved with the 
two men.

Evoking 
classic 
prison 

movies 
such 
as 
“The 

Shawshank 
Redemption,” 

Stiller masterfully creates an 
atmosphere 
that 
accurately 

reflects 
the 
harshness 
of 

life in prison in the desolate 
tundra of upstate New York. 
Yet compared with what we 
would expect, Matt and Sweat 
are shown to have (relatively 
speaking) idyllic lives in the 
prison. Matt is an artist, and 
he exploits his talent to gain 
favors 
from 
other 
prison 

guards. 
Sweat, 
while 
less 

charismatic and mysterious, is 
heavily involved in the prison’s 
tailoring workshop, which is 
where he gets involved with 
Mitchell.

While 
all 
three 
lead 

performances are exceptional, 
Arquette 
rises 
above 
the 

rest. Barely recognizable as 
a rather homely upstate New 
Yorker 
(complete 
with 
the 

region’s distinct accent), she 
is a fascinatingly sympathetic 
character. The first episode 
uses 
her 
testimony 
for 
a 

federal investigator, and from 
the minute we meet her, it is 
difficult to see her as anything 
other than a poor woman who 
is living vicariously through 
the fantasies she concocts with 
Sweat and later Matt.

Yet 
there 
is 
nothing 

exactly redeeming about any 
of 
these 
three 
characters. 

Matt and Sweat are cold-
blooded criminals and master 
manipulators, 
and 
while 

Mitchell is sympathetic, it’s 
difficult to ever justify her 
actions. So far, Stiller has not 
explored Mitchell’s life story 
enough to perhaps give a bit 
more context as to why she 
risked her life and career for 
such an outlandish plan.

Stiller opted to film several 

scenes 
in 
the 
village 
of 

Dannemora itself, capturing 
the area’s isolation and solitude, 
as well as its economically-

downtrodden landscape. There 
is a lot of further potential in 
exploring the region itself to 
explain the motivations of the 
characters.

Stiller’s drama directorial 

debut 
is 
a 
meticulously 

researched, 
planned 
and 

executed work. Brimming with 
potential and tension, “Escape 
at Dannemora” is a worthy 
watch for anyone interested in 
dark, gritty drama.

Would it really be a holly, 

jolly 
Christmas 
without 

the man, the myth and the 

legend that is Santa Claus? 
Doubtful. When the holidays 
roll around, Santa Claus seems 
to 
permeate 
nearly 
every 

aspect of our lives. We find 
him plastered on Coke bottles, 
posing 
in 
malls, 
adorning 

Christmas 
ornaments 
on 

trees and starring in favorite 
holiday flicks. Though Santa’s 
imprint on the most wonderful 
time of the year can appear 
in all different shapes and 

sizes, after watching “The 
Christmas Chronicles,” it is 
abundantly clear that Kurt 
Russell’s (“Escape from L.A.”) 
embodiment of old Saint Nick 
is exactly what we never knew 
we 
never 
needed. 
Aiming 

to be a family feel-good — 
through its wonky mixture 
of animation and live-action 
sequences, painfully poor jokes 
and ridiculous predictability — 
Netflix’s latest Christmas flick 
can’t quite bring the tidings of 
comfort and joy that it intends 
to.

FILM REVIEW

father. On Christmas Eve, with 
their mother scheduled for an 
overnight shift at the hospital, 
Kate and Teddy take a break 
from their usual bickering and 
craft a scheme to catch Santa 
in the act on video. Though 
successful in meeting Santa, 
Kate and Teddy’s night takes a 
turn for the unexpected when 
they indirectly cause him to 
lose his bag of gifts and team 
of reindeer. The Harper kids 
soon find themselves thrown 
into a wild, magical adventure, 
helping the king of Christmas 
recover his lost items, in what 
proves to be a Christmas Eve 
they’ll never forget. 

Conceptually, the notion of 

an overnight ride in Santa’s 
sleigh, a run in with reindeer 
and elves and a trip to the 
North Pole, sounds like more 
than any eight-year-old could 
ever 
want 
for 
Christmas. 

That being said, when Santa 
is the sarcastic and rugged 
Russell, the reindeer look as 
fake as cardboard cutouts 
in the mall and the elves’ 
disposition is comparable to 
ewoks, the fantasy quickly 
turns nightmarish. Perhaps 
the most triggering aspect 
of the film is the bizarre 
interactions 
between 
out-

of-place, animated creatures 
like the unbearably annoying 
ewok-elves and live actors. 
The epitome of these strange 
encounters is exemplified in a 
scene where a posse of “bad-
guy” types, clad in leather, 
capture Teddy as he tries to 
secure the precious bag of 
gifts. All that really needs to 
be said about the events that 
follow is that a fight breaks out 
between the barely-foot-tall 
elves and the hardcore gang 

members. Yes, the elves win. 
And yes, it is painful to watch. 

Fundamentally debilitating 

to the premise of the film 

is that Russell plays Santa. 
Russell is a sleek, updated, 
21st 
century 
Santa. 
Santa 

2.0, if you will, orchestrates 
a 
grand, 
semi-risqué 
jazz 

performance in a prison (this 
really 
happens). 
But 
this 

modernized, snide-comment-
making version of “Santa” is 
unrecognizable to audiences, 
miles from the concept of 
“Santa” that we all know and 
love. Santa is not supposed 
to be filled with clever quips 
and 
boyish 
jokes. 
Call 
it 

traditional, 
but 
whatever 

happened to the big-bellied, 
white-haired grandpa figure 
with a calm temperament 
and an easy smile? Maybe 
what 
makes 
Russell’s 

personification of Santa is so 
frustrating and unbelievable 
is that, in acting so human, the 
mystery of the extraordinary 
man who delivers Christmas 
cheer each year without fail 
is unveiled. And we don’t like 
what we see.

The lure of a new Christmas 

movie is enticing, but this 
Christmas, it’s probably best 
to just stick with the classics. 
By showing us exactly what 
Santa isn’t, ironically, “The 
Christmas 
Chronicles” 

delivers 
the 
important 

reminder that the true beauty 
of Santa has nothing to do 
with seeing him in the flesh. 
Rather, it lies in the imagined 
idea of the mystical toy-maker 
with a twinkle in his eye. 
When face-to-face with Santa, 
his charm and wonder are 
dulled, suggesting that maybe 
we aren’t meant to understand 
his magic at all. Maybe all 
we have to do is be good, put 
cookies by the fire and believe 
without seeing.

Wolverines and the Spartans 
were neck-and-neck throughout 
the first set, with the biggest 
deficit being just three points. 
By the time it was 23-23, it 
was anybody’s game. But two 
consecutive 
attacks 
errors 
by 
the 
Wolverines 
allowed 
Michigan State to edge out 
Michigan, 25-23, to take the 
first set.
“I think we 
came out pretty 
stale in the first 
set,” said junior 
setter Mackenzi 
Welsh.
Knowing this 
was their last 
game at Crisler, 
and 
possibly 
even 
at 
home 
depending 
on 
their seeding at Sunday’s NCAA 
selection, 
the 
Wolverines 
sought to turn the night around, 
digging, diving and getting the 
invested crowd on its feet.
On both sides though, the 
pressure 
was 
obvious, 
as 
highlight-worthy plays were 
followed by nervous fumbles 
and uncontrolled ball-handling. 
Star hitters for either team 
were consistently shut down by 
stellar blocking defense that put 
the players’ height to good use.
Rattled over losing the first 
set to a team it swept just a week 
earlier, Michigan played the 
first few points of the second 
set like a deer in the headlights, 
with 
slow 
reactions 
and 
miscommunication putting a 
kink in the well-oiled machine.
“What scared us was how we 
came out in the second set,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. “I 
thought we just came out a little 
tentative, a little on our heels, 
and it looked like we were just 
second-guessing 
ourselves 
a 
little bit.”
Even the veterans were off 
their 
game. 
Consequently, 
Rosen called a timeout after 
senior 
outside 
hitter 
Carly 
Skjodt gave up a point on a ball-
handling error.
A “Go green, go white” cheer 
broke out, calling attention to 
the decent amount of Spartan 
fans in the audience, and the 
mood shifted as Michigan State 
gained its largest lead of the 
game, 11-7.
Freshman 
outside 
hitter 
Paige Jones stepped up and 
emerged as the game’s equalizer, 
showcasing her versatility as 

a hitter and blocker. A forced 
Spartan timeout following one 
of her deafening spikes allowed 
the Wolverines to come from 
behind and take the lead of the 
set, 19-18.
Apparently Michigan State 
coach Cathy George gave the 
team the pep-talk it needed, 
because the Spartans came back 
to tie the score at a nail-biting 
24-24.
Ultimately, 
Spartan 
sophomore Alyssa Chronowski 
hit the ball out of bounds to 
hand Michigan the second set, 
27-25, leveling the match to one 
set each.
Michigan State took the lead 
again early in the third set, 
but it was Skjodt’s 11th double-
double 
of 
the 
season 
that 
underscored Michigan’s overall 
dominance. An 
ace service from 
Welsh 
seemed 
to signal the end 
was nigh.
Nevertheless, 
the 
Spartans 
fought 
tooth 
and nail, and 
the Wolverines 
took the third 
set by another 
two-point 
margin, 25-23.
Despite the closeness of the 
match, the mood lightened as 
senior night festivities took 
place. Senior libero Jenna Lerg 
was voted “Most likely to be 
President” by her teammates, 
and Michigan danced to the 
Macarena, 
waiting 
for 
the 
fourth set to commence.
This show of camaraderie 
reminded the crowd that senior 
night not only means the team 
will graduate three star players 
in Skjodt, Lerg, and setter 
Maddy Abbott, but also three 
friends and fellow Wolverines 
who have made a lasting impact 
on their younger teammates.
“I hate senior nights,” Rosen 
said about the disappointment 
of losing his players. “You can 
see their teammates’ reaction, 
how much this team, those 
players, mean to the whole 
team.”
He acknowledges that while 
Skjodt, Lerg and Abbott will 
be moving on, their impact on 
the younger team members will 
remain.
“Their legacy is going to 
be strong,” Rosen said, “but 
hopefully the younger players 
were paying attention to how 
they led, how they carried 
themselves, and we hope they 
set a great example for the 
future.”
As the fourth set culminated 
in match point, a final Spartan 
serve was fielded by Skjodt, set 
by Welsh and then nailed down 
into the back corner by Jones. 
And just like that, from senior 
to freshman, the torch had been 
passed.

Eric Montross talks Wolverine-Tar Heel matchup

Last year, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team was run out of the 
Dean E. Smith Center in an 86-71 
loss to North Carolina.
This year, as part of the Big 
Ten/ACC Challenge, the two 
teams will match up again — this 
time with a venue change, as the 
seventh-ranked Wolverines will 
take on the 11th-ranked Tar Heels 
in Ann Arbor.
Of course, these aren’t the 
same teams that squared off in 
Chapel Hill, N.C., last November. 
North Carolina (6-1) no longer 
has star point guard Joel Berry 
or wing Theo Pinson. Instead, 
surrounding forward Luke Maye 
— who has been in the National 
Player of the Year conversation 
since his breakout season last year 
— are center Garrison Brooks, 
forward Cameron Johnson and 
two heralded freshmen in guard 
Coby White and forward Nassir 
Little. Both were top-25 recruits 
who have already made their 
presence known early in the 
season.
Michigan (6-0), on the other 
hand, 
lost 
forward 
Moritz 
Wagner, 
guard 
Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman and wing 
Duncan Robinson — three of its 
five starters in last year’s game. 
And the starting point guard at 
this time last year was Eli Brooks. 
A month later, he lost his job to 
then-sophomore Zavier Simpson, 
who has since become the soul of 
the Wolverines. Sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole, sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers and junior center 
Jon Teske have seen increased 
roles, while freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis has impressed 
early.
With both schools off to good 
starts — Michigan beat reigning 
national champion Villanova on 
the road, while the Tar Heels 
defeated UCLA — the matchup 
is one of the Wolverines’ most 
anticipated this year.
The Daily spoke with former 
North 
Carolina 
player 
and 
current Tar Heels radio analyst 
Eric Montross about the matchup 
and the history between the two 
schools.
North Carolina’s first trip to 

Ann Arbor
Michigan has a lot of history 
with the Tar Heels. Most notably, 
the two met in the 1993 National 
Championship game, famous for 
Chris Webber calling a timeout 
that the Wolverines didn’t have. 
Montross played for the title-
winning North Carolina team 
that year. The two teams had also 
met in the NCAA Tournament in 
1987, 1988 and 1989. But despite 
that, the Tar Heels have never 
played in Ann Arbor.
“It’s 
almost 
mind-boggling 
that these teams haven’t met in 
Ann Arbor,” Montross said. “ … 
Top programs in the country and 
top players in the country want to 
play against the best players in the 
best venues, and there’s no doubt 
that Crisler Arena is one of the 
best venues, and this is one of the 
best teams.”
Turnover troubles
When the Tar Heels take the 
court on Wednesday, they will 
hear Roy Williams’ voice in their 
head, telling them to hang onto 
the basketball.
Turnovers weren’t the only 
problem in North Carolina’s loss 
to Texas last week, but they were 
a big part of it. The Tar Heels 
turned the ball over 17 times and 
allowed the Longhorns 31 points 
off turnovers.

“They’re 
not 
typically 
a 
turnover-prone team, and I think 
as they watch the film of the game 
against Texas, they saw there 
were a lot of unforced turnovers,” 
Montross said. “But at the same 
time, those, what we would call 
unforced turnovers … you could 
argue that they actually were 
forced by a little bit of a frenetic 
defense that Texas conveyed.”
That won’t work against a 
team like the Wolverines, who 
are known for their relentless 
defense. Opposing teams have had 
double-digit turnovers in every 
game so far against Michigan, 
and the Wolverines’ transition 
attack is good at converting those 
into points.
“Certainly, Carolina will put 
a premium on a low number of 
turnovers 
versus 
Michigan,” 
Montross said.
Anticipation for the hotly 
contested matchup
This game has gotten a lot 
of national hype, and for good 
reason. Beyond rivalry games, 
few matchups garner the level of 
enthusiasm that players and fans 
have for marquee non-conference 
contests.
“Even if they haven’t played 
while they’ve been in college, even 
for some of the upperclassmen, 
they know each other,” Montross 

said. “They’ve watched each other 
on TV. … For the freshmen, there’s 
probably a very good chance that 
there’s a familiarity there because 
of their paths having crossed in 
high school or AAU or different 
all-star teams.
“I think that when I was in 
school, obviously that was a long 
time ago, but I was still very 
familiar with Chris Webber and 
Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose 
and Jimmy King and all those 
guys. You know and respect the 
players and … you’re enthused 
about playing them.”
The history of the two teams 
in March Madness is more of 
a driver for the fans than the 
players — no one on either roster 
was born in 1993. But it’s not just 
the history that contributes to the 
aura of the matchup.
“The expectations are that 
it’s a real heavyweight fight,” 
Montross said. “It’s two of the 
country’s best programs, two of 
the best public universities that 
are really peer institutions — they 
recruit the same kids, they’re 
both very well coached, they have 
high expectations. … We know it’s 
gonna be a raucous environment, 
and the fans are terrific. I think 
there’s a high expectation for the 
level of enthusiasm that there will 
be in that arena.”

Munger guides Michigan in win over Huskies

Judging by the first half, it 
seemed like the game would 
come down to the wire. The 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team (5-1) held a slight, three-
point edge over Washington 
(3-3) with the contest still up for 
grabs.
But in the second half, senior 
guard 
Nicole 
Munger 
did 
everything she could to help 
the Wolverines pull away in 
an 80-73 victory that garnered 
them a third-place finish at the 
Gulf Coast Showcase, Sunday 
evening in Estero, Fla.
“I’m just really happy with 
the way that we just kept 
fighting and kept fighting,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
to 
WTKA 
after 
the 
game. “So I just think it speaks 
volumes.”
With one second remaining 

in the third stanza, the Huskies 
converted a jumper to tie the 
game at 55. The Wolverines 
quickly regained the lead in the 
fourth, off a layup from senior 
center Hallie Thome, but couldn’t 
take full control, so the game 
remained close. And although 
Michigan ultimately held the 
lead until the final buzzer, 
Washington still had hope.
Munger made sure to crush 
that hope.
With just over three minutes 
remaining, 
guard 
Missy 
Peterson capitalized on a fast 
break to keep the Huskies within 
five points. Munger responded 
right away from beyond the 
arc, but then forward Hannah 
Johnson made a triple of her 
own to keep Washington in the 
game.
The Huskies called a timeout 
to plan their comeback, but 
when play resumed, Munger 
drained another dagger from the 

3-point line to spoil their plans. 
Freshman guard Amy Dilk then 
made a layup on the Wolverines’ 
next offensive possession to give 
her team a 10-point lead — their 
biggest of the night — that sealed 
the deal.
Munger finished the game 
with seven 3-pointers and a 
stellar 56.3 percent field goal 
percentage for a team-high 27 
points.
“Incredible. 
Absolutely 
incredible and so happy for 
her,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
mean, she’s just an unbelievable 
kid — unbelievable player in 
our program — and just really 
personifies what we stand for.”
Dilk 
also 
contributed 
significantly with 19 points and 
seven assists, while Thome and 
junior forward Kayla Robbins 
also scored in double digits with 
13 and 10 points, respectively.
“She has really shown what 
she’s capable of doing,” Barnes 

Arico said of Dilk. “And she was 
pretty special for sure.”
The first half was a back-
and-forth fiasco; every time 
Michigan scored, the Huskies 
struck back and vice versa. 
The lead changed 20 times 
throughout the first two frames, 
with neither team building more 
than a four-point advantage. 
The Wolverines had a bit of an 
upper hand, though, as they 
never trailed after Thome made 
a layup with about three and a 
half minutes left in the second 
frame.
“It 
was 
incredible. 
We 
knew it was a tough game. We 
looked a little tired in the first 
half. We weren’t getting back 
in transition defense like we 
normally do,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They challenged us in so many 
ways. And everytime we got 
ahead, and we thought we had a 
lead, they’d cut it. It was a heck 
of a battle for us.”

Rashan Gary declares for NFL Draft

The postseason roster shifting 
has begun for the Michigan 
football team.
Junior defensive end Rashan 
Gary announced Monday that he 
will forgo his senior season with 
the Wolverines to declare for the 
2019 NFL Draft.
“I would like to thank my 
higher power, my family, the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
the 
students and the fans,” Gary 
said in his video. “But I will 
be forgoing my senior season 
to make a dream come true to 
declare for the draft. Thank you. 
Go Blue.”
The 
announcement, 
which 
came via a 30-second YouTube 
video posted to Gary’s Twitter, 
does not come as a surprise, as he 
has been unanimously projected 
as a first- or second-round pick in 
the draft.
Really, Gary has always been 
a highly-coveted prospect, no 
matter the level. He first came 
to Ann Arbor as the No. 1 recruit 
in the 2016 class, out of Paramus, 

N.J. His recruitment came down 
to the wire on National Signing 
Day, and his choice to come 
to Michigan gave coach Jim 
Harbaugh arguably the biggest 
recruiting win of his tenure.
Since then, Gary has never 
looked back. 
He 
amassed 
166 
tackles, 
10 
sacks and a forced 
fumble, 
helping 
the 
Wolverines 
to a 28-10 record 
in 
that 
time, 
and any time he 
got the chance, 
he 
expressed 
his 
love 
for 
Michigan and his 
teammates.
“I 
just 
like 
seeing my brothers, man, just 
seeing what my brothers are 
able to do,” Gary said after the 
Wolverines blew out Rutgers, 
42-7, on Nov. 10. “It’s ridiculous. 
I’m just happy to see my brothers 
eat. That just shows us as a team 
— looking at the stat sheet — that 
we’re improving individually and 
as a team.

“... It’s great to be a Michigan 
Wolverine.”
Perhaps 
Gary’s 
resume 
at 
Michigan would have been a 
bit stronger had he not suffered 
a shoulder injury this season, 
which kept him on the sideline 
for games against Maryland, 
Wisconsin 
and 
Michigan State. 
The 
declaration is the 
first in what could 
be a large group 
of 
Wolverines 
to do so. Junior 
linebacker Devin 
Bush, 
junior 
cornerbacks 
Lavert Hill and 
David 
Long, 
junior 
safety 
Josh Metellus, junior guard Ben 
Bredeson and junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson are the big names 
that have realistic options to 
move on from Ann Arbor, though 
most of their draft projections 
aren’t as strong as Gary’s.
Gary’s video did not clarify 
whether he plans to play in 
Michigan’s bowl game or not.
