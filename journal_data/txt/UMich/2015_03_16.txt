Zingerman’s 
co-founders to 

speak at Spring 2015 

commencement

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The pair who produce Reuben 

sandwiches so famous that even 
President Barack Obama has gob-
bled one down will now face a new 
challenge: crafting the perfect 
commencement address.

University alums Paul Saginaw 

and Ari Weinzweig, the co-found-
ers of Zingerman’s Community of 
Businesses, will jointly deliver the 
University’s Spring Commence-
ment address at Michigan Sta-
dium.

The two will each be awarded 

an honorary Doctor of Laws, 
pending approval from the Uni-
versity’s Board of Regents at 
Thursday’s monthly meeting.

Saginaw and Weinzweig, both 

University 
graduates, 
founded 

Zingerman’s Delicatessen in 1982. 
The deli, which was started with 
a $20,000 bank loan and two 
employees, now employs more 
than six hundred people and 
rakes in annual sales close to $50 
million.

What has since become the 

Zingerman’s Community of Busi-
nesses includes eight separate 
businesses: the deli, Zingerman’s 
Mail Order, Zingerman’s Bake-
house, Zingerman’s Training Inc., 
Zingerman’s 
Coffee 
Company, 

Zingerman’s Roadhouse, Zinger-
man’s Creamery and Zingerman’s 
Candy Manufactory.

In a March interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 
President Mark Schlissel said the 
co-founders have built a national 
model for how to run a responsible 
business.

“The attractive thing about it 

is the way they’ve built their busi-
ness,” Schlissel said. “They’ve 
kept it local, they have paid their 
employees a living wage, they 
have involved their employees in 
the management decisions about 

Non-profit partners 

with C.S. Mott, 

Beaumont hospitals 
in 18th annual event

By EMMA KILBANE

Daily Staff Reporter

Standing for a cause was taken 

literally Saturday as hundreds of 
students remained on their feet 

for 24 hours during the Univer-
sity’s 18th annual Dance Mara-
thon.

Participants raised more than 

$460,000 to support pediatric 
rehabilitation therapies for chil-
dren with disabilities at William 
C. Beaumont Hospital in Royal 
Oak and the University’s C.S 
Mott Children’s Hospital. The 
marathon edged past last year’s 
fundraising total, which drew 
more than $446,000 in dona-
tions.

“The importance of standing 

on your feet is to show your dedi-
cation to the cause, that you’re 
willing to make this sacrifice for 
those that may have challenges 
that they face on an everyday 
basis,” Brian Dobmeier, DMUM 
communications 
chair 
said. 

“This is one day where you’re 
going out of your way to chal-
lenge yourself.”

However, participants were 

only required to stay on the 
dance floor for 24 hours, instead 

of 30, which they completed in 
previous Dance Marathon events 
at the University.

Engineering 
senior 
Jayesh 

Srivastava, the DMUM execu-
tive director, said the change was 
made to increase participation.

“There was an aspect of 30 

hours that we felt excluded peo-
ple from everything that we have 
to offer,” Srivastava said. “What 
we feel and believe is that any-
one who wants to contribute and

Amicus briefs 
stream in ahead 
of April 28 oral 

arguments

After the U.S. Supreme 

Court announced in January 
it would hear a challenge to 
Michigan’s same-sex marriage 
ban, the court has scheduled 
oral hearings for April 28.

Along 
with 
reviewing 

Michigan’s case, the Supreme 
Court will review similar 
cases from Ohio, Kentucky 
and Tennessee. The Supreme

A-list comedian 

discusses his 

upcoming film and 

TV projects

By JASMINE RUSSELL-YEH

Few would say that Vince 

Vaughn (“The Internship”) is an 
underdog in the world of comedy. 
From getting jacked off under 
the dinner table in “Wedding 
Crashers” to successfully fertil-
izing 500 eggs in “Delivery Man,” 
Vaughn’s 
filmography 
boasts 

some of the most loved and hys-
terically memorable comedies 
of the past 20 years. Yet Vaughn 
often plays exactly what he is not: 
the underdog.

His latest endeavor, “Unfin-

ished Business,” is no different. 
It’s the tale of a small-business 
owner, Dan Trunkman (Vaughn), 
who takes off to Europe with 
his associates, Mike Pancake 
(Dave Franco, “22 Jump Street”) 
and Timothy McWinters (Tom 
Wilkinson, “Batman Begins”), 
to close the biggest deal of their 

lives. Again, Vaughn takes on an 
unknown, original screenplay 
and plays the guy who’s just try-
ing to figure it all out. In a con-
ference call with The Michigan 
Daily, Vaughn discussed this 
ongoing trend of underdog-esque 
characters that he chooses to play.

“I guess I relate more to the 

underdogs in life, personally. 
What I like about the movie is 
that these guys are in a position 
that they don’t like in life. They 
are involved in a job that they are 
not passionate about,” Vaughn 
said. “In a moment he pushes all 
in and thinks that things could be 
different. What’s fun is that Dave 
Franco’s character is very funny 
and unique and Tom Wilkinson 
is, it makes it root-able that you 
have a group of guys that are in a 
position where the stakes are high 
and you are rooting for them.”

And that’s the formula for 

many of his films: take a guy who 
realizes the mundane quality of 
his life and wants to make some-
thing of it, something of himself. 
From “Dodgeball” to “Wedding 
Crashers” and now “Unfinished 
Business,” this remains the case. 
The beauty of these characters is 

Student panel 
fields questions, 
discussses campus 

diversity issues

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Having anonymously sub-

mitted questions beforehand, 
students gathered Sunday after-

noon to discuss the role of race 
on campus and in society as a 
whole. Though the Angell Hall 
auditorium was far from full for 
the event, the conversation was 
open and extensive.

LSA

noon’s activities, titled “Let’s

‘U’ tries, fails to ban Hash Bash

of The African Students Association Show at the Michigan

HOW LOW CAN YOU GO

The University attempt-

ed to ban Hash Bash four 
times out of the five years 
prior, but all four times a 
judge ruled in favor of the 
National Organization for 
the Reform of Marijuana 
Laws, who organized Hash 
Bash.

In previous years, the 

University also tried to 
charge a fee to use the Diag 
and cover the costs of secu-
rity, cleanup and electrical 
expenses. The ruling judge 
ordered NORML to pay 
$1,400 of the $9,400 pro-
posed by the University.

Adam 
Brook, 
spokes-

person for the Ann Arbor

dicted that the upcoming

“teach-in” about marijuana 
legalization and he wanted 
the event to become “an act 
of civil disobedience.”

Business Friday.

Speakers talk about 

their role in the 

city’s revitalization

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

Representatives from the Detroit 

Pistons and the Detroit Tigers con-
vened on campus Friday for “Per-
spective Detroit,” an event aimed at 
changed perceptions about the city.

Sponsored by the Central Stu-

dent Government’s Commission 
on Detroit Engagement, the event 
featured discussion of several busi-
nesses and organizations growing 
their presence in Detroit.

LSA freshman Rohin Patel, the 

commission’s chair, said the idea 
for the event after hearing how 
people reacted to his working in 
the city.

“People were pretty surprised at 

the fact that I did work in Detroit 
because they thought it was too 
dangerous and things like that,” 
Patel said. “That kind of got me 
thinking that a lot of students at 

the University don’t necessarily 
know about the opportunities in 
the city and it would be great to 
hold an event that raises aware-
ness about them.”

The event featured speakers 

from the Detroit Tigers, Detroit 
Pistons, Fox Sports Detroit and the 
financial media company Benz-
inga. Before LSA freshman Dylan 
Bennett introduced the speakers, 
he discussed several challenges 
facing the city, including crime, 
aging infrastructure, inadequate 
transit and blight.

Bennett 
explained 
how 
in 

the mid-2000s, as Detroit lost 
money, the police department lost 
resources and crime rose. At its 
worst, police were solving only 8.7 
percent of Detroit’s crimes. This, 
in part, was due to a lack of police 
cruisers and their response time 
being a full hour.

Bennett also mentioned The 

Detroit Connector, the bus route 
that runs from the Ann Arbor to 
Detroit in an effort to better con-
nect the two cities.

“This is revolutionizing the rela-

tionship the University of Michi-

gan has with the city of Detroit,” 
Bennett said.

During the event, the panelists 

discussed how they believed their 
companies were contributing to 
Detroit’s revival.

“The Tigers are a vital part of the 

center of Detroit,” Ron Wade, direc-
tor of marketing for the Detroit 
Tigers, said. “Sports tends to be the 
one thing that unites various parts 
of the city and suburbs, and the 
Tigers have a big role in that.”

Nick Bartolone, senior director 

of advertisement for the Detroit 
Pistons, explained why the team’s 
special 
Sunday 
jerseys 
sport 

“Motor City.”

“The league launched this initia-

tive to have this ‘pride jersey,’ ” he 
said. “What’s more prideful for us 
than Motor City, right?”

Lauren Pober, director of mar-

keting at Fox Sports Detroit, said 
by talking about Detroit on the air 
during sports games, the company 
generates business interest in the 
city from listeners.

The only speaker not involved in 

sports was Jason Raznick, the CEO 
of Benzinga, a financial media com-

pany. The company is currently 
based out of Southfield, but is in the 
process of relocating to Detroit.

When asked why he is moving 

his company, Raznick explained 
that he believes in Detroit.

“Detroit started this big nation-

al resonance turnaround story,” 
Raznick said. “People like turn-

around stories. They like come-
backs. People want to be a part of 
something bigger than just a little 
company.”

Bennett said he believes the Uni-

versity can be an important partner 
for revitalization efforts in the city.

“The University of Michigan, 

with its abundance of resources 

and world-class account, has the 
opportunity to have a huge role in 
the development and restructur-
ing of a great American city that’s 
40 minutes away,” Bennett said. 
“That’s an opportunity that no 
other university has, and it’s one 
that we really can’t afford to give 
up.”

put their effort towards the cause 
should be allowed to do so.”

The dancers make up 64 teams 

with 15 to 20 students in each. 
The teams compete against one 
another in different activities, 
such as a hula-hooping con-
test, a Miss America pageant 
and a cheering contest. Teams 
are partnered with one of the 
35 families of a child with a dis-
ability, who they interact with at 
the marathon as well as at events 
throughout the year. Some fami-
lies were partnered with multiple 
teams.

DMUM, which is the larg-

est student-run non-profit in 
the state, fundraises these large 
sums because participants are 
each required to raise a certain 
amount. Dancers raise $300 and 
team leaders must collect $350, 
for example. The marathon is 
also the culmination of a year’s 
worth of fundraising activities. 
This year, teams attended a char-

ity ball, a family fashion show, a 
talent show and 26 other fund-
raising and bonding events.

To participate in the mara-

thon, dancers must remain stand-
ing for the full 24 hours. Dancers 
were provided with standing 
homework tables, a snack station, 
a photo booth and other games 
and activities during the course 
of the event. An “inspiration 
tent” was also set up for partici-
pants needing a reminder of why 
they chose to spend the weekend 
on their feet.

LSA sophomore Claire Laing, 

co-captain of the Delta Gamma 
team, returned to DMUM for 
her second year. Laing said the 
event is a great way to finish off 
the year.

“Throughout the year you 

work so hard to raise money and 
you get to interact with the fami-
lies and really see where every-
thing you’re doing is going,” 
Laing said. “To be able to come 
to the marathon and have this 
big culmination and celebration 
of all the hard work you’ve put in 
and seeing all the kids, it’s awe-

some.”

Srivastava, the DMUM execu-

tive director, said the organiza-
tion plays a role in choosing what 
area of the two hospitals funds go 
to each year.

“We have this unique oppor-

tunity to take in requests from 
lots of the different therapies and 
programs at both the hospitals, 
go through their requests and 
see exactly what they’re asking 
for and really evaluate how that 
aligns with what our mission is,” 
Srivastava said. “Then we get to 
allocate the money towards those 
programs.”

The event kicked off with 

warm-up events on Saturday, 
including an address from Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel. 
Schlissel commended DMUM 
participants, and highlighted the 
participation of fraternities and 
sororities.

“The news media loves to 

write about problems and disas-
ters and misbehavior,” Schlissel 
said. “I want to make sure they 
write about the contribution that 
the Greeks are making to events 

like this.”

Entertainment from groups 

such as the Pompon Team, the 
Ballroom 
Dance 
Team 
and 

Groove kept dancers on their toes 
as the event drew to a close. The 
event also featured a late night 
rave complete with glow sticks 
and flashing lights, where other 
students could dance and sup-
port their friends.

lective; and LSA sophomore Mek-
arem Eljamal, spokeswoman and 
member of Students Allied for 
Freedom and Equality.

Davis said the event’s purpose 

was to make conversation about 
race accessible to everyone.

“Just being open to new per-

spectives is really important,” she 
said. “Sometimes you just have to 
get over that initial barrier, then 
you have wider groups’ friends 
and end up having conversations 
you never would imagine.”

Some students submitted ques-

tions anonymously through an ask.
fm page that Wilson organized and 
read from, and audience members 
also posed questions directly to the 
panel. Attendees were encouraged 
to share their opinions and per-
sonal experiences as well, either 
anonymously or in person.

The questions covered a wide 

variety of subjects, including the 
panelists’ personal experiences 
and their opinions on campus 
policies.

One issue discussed at length 

was the University’s Race and Eth-
nicity requirement, which students 
have criticized recently for not pro-
viding enough insight into issues of 
diversity on campus and nationally.

Alfarhan feared that the class-

es used to fulfill this requirement 
do not spark relevant conversa-
tion about issues of diversity.

“A lot of Race and Ethnicity 

classes at the University are very 
basic and don’t require anyone’s 
perceptions to be challenged,” 
she said. “They’re made to be very 
comfortable.”

Davis agreed that the Race 

and Ethnicity classes could be 
improved, but added that they 
provide “a good place to start” as 
opposed to no conversation at all.

Eljamal said, in her experience, 

some of the inefficiency of the Race 
and Ethnicity courses are a result 
of students being unwilling to talk.

“Some students are only there 

to get a check mark on their tran-
script,” Eljamal said. “There’s 
only so much a professor can do.”

Another topic covered was the 

University’s attitude toward diver-
sity, where the panelists expressed 
particular 
concern 
with 
the 

administration’s Detroit recruit-
ment policies, among others.

Ajetunmobi said the Univer-

sity has fallen short with recruit-
ing students from predominantly 
Black schools. She added that Cass 
Technical 
High 
School 
and 

Renaissance High School, both in 
Detroit, seem to get a great deal 
of attention while others fall by 
the wayside — resulting in a lower 
diversity overall in applications 
and, later, on campus.

“I had a lot of friends who 

didn’t even apply to Michigan 
because they didn’t think they 
could get in,” Ajetunmobi said. 
“And we need to change that.”

Alfarhan discussed her view 

of the discrepancy in interna-
tional recruitment based on her 
own experience as an interna-
tional student from Kuwait. She 
said she noticed a lack of cultural 
diversity during her international 
orientation as a freshman, which 
included a large majority of Chi-
nese students.

“When I counted, there were 

four Africans and five Arabs,” 
she said. “And there were at least 
eighty Chinese.”

While Wilson was disappoint-

ed with the sparse attendance, 
he said those who did attend the 
event provided encouragement.

“There are some people I didn’t 

expect to come and some people I 
don’t recognize, which is great,” 
Wilson said.

In this vein, some members 

in the audience noted that those 
at the event were likely already 
somewhat knowledgeable about 
issues of diversity, whereas those 
who really “needed” to have deep 
conversations about race and eth-
nicity were least likely to attend 
on their own accord.

The panelists acknowledged 

that getting those who are poten-
tially less outwardly passionate 
about issues of diversity to attend 
events like “Let’s Talk About: 
Race” is an issue to be considered 
in the future.

Alfarhan’s response: “Don’t 

focus on who’s not showing up; 
focus on who is showing up.”

struck down the ban.

University law Prof. Julian 

Mortenson 
said 
these 
cases 

are broken down into two cat-
egories. He said the first cate-
gory involves a same-sex couple 
legally marrying in a state where 
same-sex marriage is permitted, 
but moving to a state where it is 
not permitted, meaning that the 
couple’s marriage is not legally 
recognized in that state. The 
second issue involves same-sex 
couples who live in a state where 
same-sex marriage is not permit-
ted and want to get married.

“The same underlying state 

policy is preventing the legal 
recognition of marriage in either 
case, but the nature of the legal 
claims involved to the two cat-
egories of case are a little and 
potentially 
very 
different,” 

Mortenson said.

Mortenson noted that this 

case has significant implications, 
including the possibility of legal-
izing same-sex marriage in all 50 
states.

“The Supreme Court says and 

always will bind every other 
court in the country,” Mortenson 
said. “So if the Supreme Court 
says in this case, ‘It is constitu-
tional to allow same-sex couples 
to get married,’ that ruling will 

apply to every state that is direct-
ly involved in this case.”

Even though only four state 

cases are directly involved in the 
proceedings, if states not directly 
involved don’t follow this prec-
edent, they could face sanctions.

“If states don’t quit enforcing 

or repeal their bans on marriage 
equality or their bans on same-
sex marriage, it’ll be about five 
seconds before a court enters an 
adjunction in those states that 
aren’t involved in this case agree-
ing to some plaintiff’s challenge 
to the same-sex marriage ban 
that applies to their state,” he 
said.

Mortenson said he was hesi-

tant to predict the outcome of 
the case, but noted that the legal 
world has hinted at an outcome 
without the Supreme Court’s 
decision. He said if an objec-
tive stance is taken based on the 
cases, marriage equality should 
be granted.

“If you look at the cases and if 

you look at the logic of the cases 
and if you apply them faithfully, 
I think the best current legal pre-
diction is that the Supreme Court 
should rule in favor of marriage 
equality,” he said.

University law Prof. Samuel 

Bagenstos said the Supreme 
Court could take two possible 
routes to rule in favor of same-
sex marriage. He said one route 
is a broad approach.

“They 
could say when 

laws classify based on sexual 
orientation those laws trigger 
heightened constitutional scruti-
ny which would mean they would 
have to be justified by particular-
ly strong state interest and have 
to be closely connected to those 
interests,” he said. “Obviously if 
the court rules that way that will 
lead to a lot of momentum for 
anti-discrimination laws on the 
basis of sexual orientation to get 
passed.”

Bagenstos also cited a narrow-

er route to legalizing same-sex 
marriage. He said the court could 
opt for limited reasoning, saying 
the states’ justifications for pre-
cluding same-sex couples from 
marrying are irrational.

“If they did that, the legal 

implications 
wouldn’t 
be 
as 

extensive, but on the other hand, 
I’d take that the social implica-
tions would be very similar,” 
he said. “Probably, the political 
implications would be very simi-
lar.”

Bagenstos said it is difficult to 

predict which route the court is 
going to take or even how they 
are going to rule.

“I, like most people, predict 

that the court is going to say that 
same-sex couples have an equal 
right to marry as opposite-sex 
couples,” Bagenstos said. “But 
how they are going to get there, I 
don’t think anybody knows.”

Bagenstos 
noted 
Supreme 

Court Justice Anthony Kenne-

dy’s importance as a swing vote 
in same-sex marriage cases. He 
noted that in the time since Ken-
nedy joined the bench, the court 
has made progress when it comes 
to ruling on the side of gay rights, 
citing the 1993 case Romer v. 
Evans, 2003’s Lawrence v. Texas 
and Windsor v. United States in 
2013.

“In all of those cases, the court 

has ruled for the party that is 
supporting gay rights, but the 
reasoning in all of those cases 
has been very narrow,” he said. 
“The court has not articulated a 
very expansive understanding of 
the reasoning behind its pro-gay 
rights position.”

As the oral hearings near, 

many 
groups, 
including 
the 

Obama administration, have filed 
amicus briefs to the Supreme 
Court in support of same-sex 
marriage. State Rep. Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann Arbor) was one of the 
elected officials to be included 
in an amicus brief sent to the 
Supreme Court by the Ohio and 
Michigan Democratic Parties.

Irwin said he was proud to join 

in an amicus brief that supports 
equal rights.

“Michigan’s 
ban 
on 
mar-

riage equality and Michigan’s 
ban on gay and lesbian adoption 
has been a wrong that many of 
us have been trying to right for 
many years here in Michigan.”

M

any of you probably have 
pets at home. Whether 
they’re 
the 
standard 

dog or cat, or 
even something 
a little more odd 
like a miniature 
pig, chameleon, 
hedgehog 
or 

stoat 
(seriously, 

look 
them 
up, 

they’re adorable), 
we love and pro-
vide for them. 
We want to make 
sure our pets are 
safe, well nour-
ished and healthy, treating them like 
a member of our own family. But 
when it comes to animals that we do 
not call “pets,” our desire to protect 
and defend goes out the window.

For a long time, humans have con-

sidered themselves the top of the ani-
mal kingdom. Intellectually, perhaps. 
We have some brain capacities that 
other developed and complex organ-
isms have yet to match. Our reason-
ing is finely tuned, and our ability to 
perceive potential results helps us 
to plan and avoid problematic out-
comes. But then again, we claimed 
the title “top of the animal kingdom” 
ourselves. No other animal has said 
“Ah yes, homo sapiens are indeed 
superior to us in terms of X, Y and 
Z.” We gave ourselves that title and 
have placed ourselves at the top and 
categorized other animals in relation 
to the widespread hairless ape.

I guess I should announce that 

I’m a whole-hearted believer in 
evolution. In fact, it’s my major. I 
know there has been a disconnecton 
between humans and the rest of the 
animal kingdom for centuries, and 
Charles Darwin, Thomas Malthus 

and Thomas Huxley were some of 
the first to take the stance that we 
weren’t an exception to the rules of 
nature. But recently, there has been 
a lack of concern for those that we’re 
not close to, or those that we do not 
consider as family.

In America, we don’t have that 

many native large creatures. Yes, 
bears and buffalo can be huge, 
but how often do we actually see 
these in physical proximity to our-
selves? Humans are the ones that 
are large and smart, in comparison 
to the dogs and cats and other pets 
with which we 
are 
constantly 

interacting. 
I 

think that this is 
why there’s not 
as much stress 
to protect the 
animals that are 
not around us, 
because there’s a 
twisted percep-
tion of how we, 
as humans, are in the animal king-
dom. We’re not dwarfed in stature 
by many animals, and we’re hardly 
rivaled in strength. Therefore, our 
lives are not in perspective.

Elephants are the largest land 

mammal. These enormous creatures 
are found in high concentrations 
throughout 
India, 
Africa 
and 

Sri 
Lanka, 
interacting 
with 

humans in many settings, such as 
transportation, tourist attractions 
and when habitats collide. Though 
they can be deemed as sensitive and 
docile animals, they can cause great 
damage to small towns, demolishing 
homes and cars. A similar situation 
can be found in Africa with gorillas 
and rhinoceroses attacking humans 
when they feel threatened. Those 

individuals who interact with them 
on a constant basis are aware of the 
power that they possess. It allows 
humans to see their place in the 
animal kingdom, where we stand 
in physical strength and emotional 
capabilities 
such 
as 
mourning 

and outrage. When we lose that 
perspective, I think we lose respect 
for the other creatures with which 
we share this planet.

We’re constantly driven by our 

own selfish endeavors, regardless of 
the consequences for the creatures 
that 
cannot 
speak. 
Destruction 

of 
habitats, 

killing for sport 
and killing for 
products 
like 

ivory or hands 
(yes, 
gorilla 

hands 
are 
a 

commodity) 
are 
driving 

these creatures 
to 
extinction. 

We think that 

humans are at the top, mighty over 
these beasts. But if they could have 
the chance to defend themselves, 
humans would easily lose. A gunshot 
can end any life, whether it’s that of a 
human, a cat or a massive pachyderm. 
But if left to nature’s rules, those that 
are strong would prevail.

Unfortunately, those who hold 

the gun are at the top and dic-
tate what happens in nature. Just 
because they’re not our pets doesn’t 
mean that we can disrespect these 
animals. They’re on the same phylo-
genetic tree that we are. We are not 
an addendum to the animal king-
dom, but rather in it together.

The fight over the right to pee

C

harin Davenport, a transgen-
der activist and professor at 
both Delta College and Sagi-

naw Valley State 
University, 
has 

been 
extremely 

vocal 
regarding 

recent events at 
a Midland Planet 
Fitness, where last 
week, gym patron 
Yvette 
Cormier’s 

membership 
was 

revoked 
after 

she 
continuously 

hassled other gym 
patrons and man-
agement about a transgender woman 
using the women’s locker room. The 
story has since garnered national 
attention, having been picked up by 
both Fox News and MSNBC.

Davenport, a veteran and former 

journalist, gave her take on the story, 
and told attendees her personal experi-
ences as a transgender woman at a stu-
dent-run event last Friday at East Quad. 
In her opening statements, Davenport 
described the event in Midland as “one 
of those before and after moments” of 
transgender history that should be of 
great importance to those identifying as 
transgender and their advocates.

In light of recently introduced 

legislation in Texas, Florida and 
Kentucky that, if passed, would effec-
tively entrust cisgender citizens to 
police gendered bathrooms, incentiv-
izing surveillance in some instances 
with a $2,000 bounty, Davenport 
may indeed be right. The happenings 
at Planet Fitness have since become a 
vignette in discussions surrounding the 
legitimacy of whistleblowing transgen-
der citizens and their bathroom use.

Davenport views the introduction 

of what she call “Bathroom Bounty 
Bills” as completely unnecessary. She 
believes a transgender person should 
be able to use bathrooms, locker rooms 
or any other facility that is congruent 
with their gender identity.

“It seems inconceivable to me that 

people feel the need to legislate what 
others can do based on whether they 
have penises or vaginas,” Davenport 
lamented. “If I have to take a pee, for 
some reason many of our elected lead-
ers feel the need to decide how and 
where I do it.”

Davenport 
segued 
seamlessly 

between “Bounty Bills” and an expla-
nation of her personal journey in com-
ing to terms with her female identity, 
a story underscored by tenets of the 
transphobic society of the mid-20th 
century in which she came of age.

Growing up in the Saginaw area, 

Davenport felt stifled by the senti-
ments of both her direct environment 
and those expressed in the media; she 
took these as signals to “shut up” and 
lead a cisgender life.

“I was afraid to talk to anybody 

about it,” she disclosed to me after the 
event. “I felt like my body was right, 
but that I was wrong.”

So she attempted to hyper-mascu-

linize herself; she engaged in drug use 
and partook in any dare that came her 
way, even joining the military after 
high school in hopes that the experi-
ence would “toughen her up.” It wasn’t 
until after two failed marriages and 
three children that Davenport began 
her transition.

In lieu of leading a quiet life as 

a transgender woman, Davenport 
became an out-
spoken 
repre-

sentative 
for 

the transgender 
community, spe-
cifically 
regard-

ing the rights of 
transgender vet-
erans. However, 
she considers her 
work in advocat-
ing for 2014 non-
discrimination legislation for LGBTQ 
employees in Bay County to be her 
entrance to the political theater.

According to Davenport, her one of 

her biggest challenges since her debut 
has been trying to work with Rep. Gary 
Glenn, (R–Larkin Township), who co-
authored 
Michigan’s 
controversial 

Marriage Protection Amendment. The 
amendment’s disputed legality in the 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is at the 
center of current U.S. Supreme Court 
proceedings on same-sex marriage.

Glenn has also been outspoken 

about the Planet Fitness event.

“Planet Fitness obviously should 

rethink its anti-woman, anti-reality 
policy,” Glenn was reported to have 
said in an MLive article. “If they 
don’t, they shouldn’t be surprised in 
a conservative family-friendly com-
munity such as Midland if they lose 
more female members.”

“Sometimes it feels like his number 

one cause in life seems to be to keep 
me out (of the bathroom),” Daven-
port said last Friday in response to 
Glenn’s comments, “I’m not sure he 
understands what he’s talking about 
because I don’t get the sense that he 
understands what those of us in the 
trans community are talking about.”

I’d agree with Davenport on that one.
It’s a strange world we live in when 

white, conservative men feel that they 
can express obstinacy to humanist acts 
under the guise of accusing others of 
discrimination. In my opinion, if any-
one should be accused of being “anti-
woman” and “anti-reality,” it should 
be Cormier — after all, it was she 
who, over a four-day period, sought to 
embarrass, vilify and further margin-
alize a fellow woman.

Despite this obvious paradox, many 

have rushed to Cormier’s defense. 
On a Fox News segment titled “Legal 
Insanity,” Elisabeth Hasselbeck took 
a haphazard approach to analyzing 
the event from a legal standpoint. One 
of the segment’s contributors, Keith 
Ablow, a psychiatrist and author, made 
the following claim:

“They’re not settled on the fact that 

when somebody … declares, ‘I am of 

this gender,’ but 
they 
are 
ana-

tomically 
and 

genetically 
of 

another 
gender, 

people who see 
that 
individual 

have strong feel-
ings, like, ‘Look, 
I’m being viewed 
potentially while 
unclothed.’”

He’s got a point: ignorance some-

times 
goes 
unconsidered 
when 

attempting to legislate in ways accept-
ing and fair to those with marginalized 
identities. However, it seems that those 
views are, at the very least, allotted a 
bully pulpit on cable television. I expe-
rience “strong feelings” of nausea with 
regard to the latter, but I stomach it all 
the same. Opponents of inclusionary 
tactics should have to follow suit.

I wouldn’t expect those deaf to the 

plights of subjugated groups to change 
their views. However, what I would 
expect is, at the very least, a certain level 
of respect for another citizen’s right to 
conduct themself in a manner in which 
they believe they will feel healthy and 
safe. If a transgender individual has the 
courage to express themselves in the 
face of predetermined societal norms 
in a way in which they feel is congru-
ent with their identity, that’s their right. 
Bodily integrity and one’s right to pri-
vacy are civil liberties which shouldn’t 
by any means be abridged, regardless 
of the “strong feelings” one has to a 
certain means of expression. Even con-
servative lawmakers — self-proclaimed 
warriors of the U.S. Constitution — 
should understand that.

L

ast week, a video surfaced of members of the Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting 
a song littered with several racial slurs and profanities. 

David Boren, the President of the University of Oklahoma, reacted 
promptly to the matter. Within 48 hours of the video gaining 
national attention, Boren expelled the fraternity members deemed 
integral in the chant’s orchestration and ordered the members of 
the fraternity to vacate their house, severing all ties between SAE 
and the university. Many universities across the country, and their 
respective presidents, have acted poorly and inefficiently when 
issues have arisen in the Greek life community, but Boren had the 
power to enact strong university sanctions due, in no small part, 
to the University of Oklahoma’s claimed ownership of fraternity 
houses. However, recent claims have stated that the fraternity owns 
the land, while the university has legal claims over the house itself. 
This authority is essential to swift decision-making and assertion 
of power over Greek life when inappropriate behavior occurs.

At the University of Michigan, President 

Mark Schlissel doesn’t wield such authority 
over Greek life, limiting his ability to act 
as effectively in enacting sanctions for the 
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, which vandalized 
a northern Michigan ski resort, resulting 
in over $100,000 in damages. According to 
Dean of Students Laura Blake Jones’ letter 
outlining the sanctions to the fraternity, SAM 
has been suspended from the Interfraternity 
Council for four years, and the chapter is no 
longer recognized by the University. Due 
to the way in which Greek life is organized 
at the University, these sanctions become 
questionable and arguably useless unless the 
national chapters take action.

These kinds of sanctions have been put 

in place here at the University in the past, 
such as those levied against the University’s 
SAE chapter. But, under this problematic 
system, SAE is able to function in largely 
the same way. Since their house isn’t owned 
by the University, they’re still able to act as 
a fraternity; they’re simply no longer a part 
of the Interfraternity Council after being 
suspended for several hazing allegations. 
The most recent sanctions will place SAM 
in a similar situation. Unlike SAE, SAM has 
been indefinitely suspended by its national 
chapter. However, the sanctions the national 
chapter has taken against the University’s 
SAM chapter are unclear.

The University must reevaluate how 

fraternities are punished. Fraternities that 
are suspended and/or kicked off campus 
are sanctioned for a reason. It’s problematic 
that they are still able to exist. Currently, 
all violations by Greek life chapters are run 
through the Greek Activities Review Panel. 
Because all members of GARP are affiliated 
with Greek life, bias potentially becomes 
an issue when bringing forward issues 
within the Greek system. Self-governance 
has its inherent issues. It would be more 
beneficial to include non-Greek life members, 

administration and the University’s president 
on the board. As more and more fraternity 
scandals are erupting across the country, it’s 
vital that universities hold the proper power 
in order to act in an effective and meaningful 
manner.

Recently, too many fraternities have made 

headlines, and not for respectable reasons. 
This week alone, University of Maryland’s 
chapter of Kappa Sigma has taken the 
spotlight after an e-mail promoting racism 
and non-consensual sex was leaked. A 
common theme between these scandals is 
that something, whether an e-mail or a video, 
is being leaked. Although the e-mail from 
the Kappa Sigma member was dated January 
2014, it’s only surfacing now. The recently 
leaked media from various chapters across 
the country seems to indicate that there’s a 
systemic and institutional problem that needs 
to be examined. This calls for universities to 
be making more investigations of chapters to 
regulate the ideals of such institutions.

It’s not the exclusive responsibility of 

universities’ respective authorities to do 
the policing of Greek life. There should 
be a common understanding within these 
communities 
that 
these 
behaviors 
are 

completely unacceptable. Greek life members 
across the country should be taking the 
responsibility to improve the reputation of 
their organizations, but more importantly 
to ensure that the beliefs and values of their 
chapters are concurrent with positive goals 
and acceptance across the board.

When functioning properly, Greek life 

provides several benefits to its members. The 
recent scandals from fraternities across the 
country have shown that there is a problem 
with these institutions. Ultimately, it’s essential 
for presidents of the universities to have more 
authority over the system and for leaders of 
these communities to self-evaluate whether or 
not the values of its members are acceptable in 
order to combat these issues and make Greek 

Reevaluating the system

Modest Mouse is 
back after hiatus

Indie vets push into 
new musical terrain 

on new album

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

Modest Mouse, well known for 

its early 2004 single “Float On” 
and sometimes Pink Floyd-esque 
sound, has not 
released 
an 

album for eight 
years. 

Comprised 

primarily 
of 

singer/guitar-
ist Isaac Brock, 
drummer 
Jer-

emiah 
Green 

and bassist Eric 
Judy, the Ameri-
can rock band was formed in 1993 
in Issaquah, Wash. and gleaned 
its name from the Virginia Woolf 
story, “The Mark on the Wall.” 
Its debut album, This is a Long 
Drive for Someone with Nothing to 
Think About, was released in 1996 
and used popular soft rock ele-
ments such as quick guitar riffs 
and steady, softer drums. The 
Lonesome Crowded West is often 
labeled their breakthrough album 
and consequently gained the band 
a cult following that still exists 
today. 2007’s We Were Dead Before 
the Ship Even Sank, the band’s fifth 
album, was the first Modest Mouse 
release to reach #1 on the Billboard 
200 Charts.

The band’s anxiously awaited 

sixth album, Strangers to Our-
selves, is set to release on Mar. 
17 and consists of 15 songs, each 
more innovative than the last. 
This album explores musical tech-
niques not yet breached in previous 
Modest Mouse endeavors such as 
warped vocals and off-kilter brass 
instruments, as seen in tracks like 
“Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami, FL 
1996)” and “Sugar Boats.” While 
these unconventional methods 
sometimes lead the album astray, 
without risk there would be no 
innovation. 

The opening and titular track, 

“Strangers to Ourselves,” begins 
with a steady drumbeat and swell-
ing violins before launching into 
Brock crooning “Lucky we’re so 
capable to forget” into the micro-
phone. It’s fairly unstructured and 
is essentially just the musings of 
the lead singer, but it is an excel-
lent way to set the stage for the 
rest of the album. “Lampshades 
on Fire” was the first single to be 
released and a glimpse of the hard-
core drumming that has come to 
be associated with Modest Mouse. 
It has everything — catchy “ba ba 

ba das,” overlapping vocals, lyr-
ics about mistakes and moving 
on. Directly following “Strangers 
to Ourselves,” “Lampshades on 
Fire” gets the blood flowing and 
launches into Modest Mouse’s new 
sound. 

“Shit in Your Cut” slows things 

down again with sultry guitar riffs 
and mysterious, growly vocals. 
Brock 
simultaneously 
harbors 

a bitterness towards humanity 
and loneliness as witnessed in 
the lines “With the strain and the 
comforting / You know everyone 
needs to go / But don’t everyone 
go at once.” The following track, 
“Pistol,” is the weirdest number 
on the album. The title of the song 
references American spree killer 
Andrew Cunanan, but the actual 
song is entirely about sex. With 
heavy drums, distorted speaking 
vocals and lines like, “Come into 
my room and clean my pistol 
loaded up,” the whole song is one 
giant euphemism. 

From “Pistol,” the album heads 

to “Ansel,” a sobering tale with a 
folky beat that describes Brock’s 
brother’s hiking accident. “The 
Ground Walks, with Time in a 
Box” is the longest song at just 
over six minutes and feels like a 
jack-in-the-box that is constantly 
on the edge of popping up. The 
tempo increases with swirling 
vocals and builds to an unsatisfy-
ing ending. “Coyotes” is arguably 
the simplest song, but one of the 
best. Brock touches on human-
ity’s destructive habits again, 
singing 
“Mankind’s 
behaving 

like some serial killers / Giant old 
monsters afraid of the sharks.” 
The 
straightforward 
guitar 

plucks and swelling chorus allow 
the lyrics themselves to take cen-
ter stage. 

The guitar on “Pups to Dust” 

throws it back to early Modest 
Mouse and the lyrics address 
broader concepts, such as human 

purpose, “We don’t belong here/
We were just born here,” and rea-
sons to live. 

“Sugar 
Boats” 
is 
another 

curveball, using a jazzy circus 
tune and distorted, winding 
machine sounds to throw the lis-
tener into some strange, upside 
down universe. The lyrics tend 
to disappear between the ringing 
cowbells and bold trumpets, but 
Brock attempts to regain control 
and sticks to the same themes of 
ignorance as to the purpose of 
life. 

“Wicked Campaign” is vocal 

heavy, relying mainly on the song’s 
lyrics to carry it through. In a 
movie, it’s the type of song that 
would be playing during a mon-
tage of the main character driving 
around while they make an impor-
tant decision. “Be Brave” is gritty, 
substantial and repetitive. The 
shark metaphor makes a return 
with “As sharks in sheep’s clothing 
/ Talking with our hips,” but the 
rest of the song is an anthem for 
human resiliency, which is always 
appreciated. 

“God is an Indian and You’re 

an Asshole” is a repetitive, yet 
entertaining interlude with the 
only lyrics being “God is an 
Indian and you’re an asshole / 
Get on your horse and ride.”

“The Tortoise and the Tour-

ist” has received a positive 
response 
amongst 
dedicated 

Modest Mouse fans and for just 
cause. Echoing the title of the 
album, the song uses powerful 
lyrics to describe packing up and 
leaving life behind. “The Best 
Room” is a quick, upbeat, sarcas-
tic response to “The Tortoise and 
the Tourist.” It’s the makeshift 
ending to Strangers to Ourselves, 
summing up all the previous 
thoughts in a stompy rant. “Of 

Course We Know” is the true end 
to the album, minimizing the 
vocals and maximizing the con-
templative guitar solos. Brock 
comments one final time, “What 
we’re here for/We just do not 
know,” bringing the album full 
circle with just as few answers as 
it began with. 

At its heart Strangers to Our-

selves is the same Modest Mouse 
that fans know and love, just 
eight years older. Brock contin-

ues to sing about his distaste for 
humanity, but adds an element of 
active curiosity in his quest for 
the purpose of life. While some 
tracks may not fit expectations, 
part of the beauty of a distin-
guished band is their ability to 
take risks and expand their genre. 
Time will be the only way to see if 
Modest Mouse can continue their 
22-year run and develop it into a 
lifetime.

TV REVIEW

‘Bates’ builds drama

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

For a show that borrows its 

characters and story from the 
Master of Suspense, “Bates Motel” 
is decidedly un-
Hitchcockian. 
There’s 
zero 

subtlety in its 
visuals or story-
telling, the act-
ing can verge on 
theatrical 
and 

over-the-top, 
and horrific plot 
elements 
like 

brutal violence 
and incest are 
included 
pri-

marily for their 
shock factor. This all might seem to 
add up to a hot mess of a show, and, 
truth be told, it usually does. But 
in its third season, “Bates Motel” 
shows more confidence than ever, 
finally embracing its madness and 
becoming one of the most enter-
taining shows on TV.

The backbone of “Bates Motel” 

is the journey of Norman Bates 
(Freddie 
Highmore, 
“August 

Rush”) from a meek teen to the 
stalking, 
murderous 
character 

viewers know from Hitchcock’s 
“Psycho.” So far, “Bates” has 
mostly pinned Norman’s budding 
pathology on his unhealthy atti-
tudes toward women. His moth-
er Norma (Vera Farmiga, “The 
Departed”) is the number one lady 
in his life, but their relationship is 
probably too intimate for a mother 
and 18-year-old son. Norma’s other 
son, forgotten child Dylan (Max 
Thieriot, “House at the End of the 
Street”) points out at the begin-
ning of the episode that it might 
not be normal for the two to spend 
nights snuggling and sharing a 

bed. Norma and Norman rely upon 
one another as their sole source of 
unconditional love and support; 
for a woman who has suffered a 
string of toxic lovers and a boy who 
wants nothing more than to quiet 
the murderous turmoil lurking 
underneath the surface, their bond 
is the only thing keeping all that 
pain from breaking them. When 
Dylan makes the comment and 
implies an incestuous relationship, 
he’s not only speaking what’s likely 
on viewers’ minds, but he’s prob-
lematizing this crucial mother/son 
relationship, perhaps providing 
the first spark that switches Nor-
man into the literal lady-killer we 
know he will become.

“A Death in the Family” also 

provides storic exigency by mak-
ing Norman more of an active 
creeper than he ever was before. 
He’s taken to voyeurism and fetish-
istic sex before, but the arrival of 
Annika (Tracy Spiridakos, “Revo-
lution”), a beautiful young hotel 
guest, renews Norman’s perverted 
tendencies. When Annika checks 
in, she drops her belongings on the 
ground, and Norman bends down 
to help (but mostly to blatantly 
stare at her cleavage). Freddie 
Highmore is able to switch from 
the shy and sweet Norman to this 
dangerous deviant with just a sub-
tle flicker in his eyes. Highmore 
plays it as compulsion, not desire 
— when he later spies on Annika 
through the peephole of her hotel 
door and follows her on a drive 
to a local restaurant, it’s obvious 
that he’s driven by the same inner 
force that blacks out his memory, 
makes him kill and draws him to 
taxidermy and the macabre. In a 
show that so obviously hits view-
ers over the head with callbacks to 
Hitchcock, this might be the clos-
est thing we have to a ticking bomb 

under the table, to subtle, live-wire 
suspense.

Where Norman arches slowly 

to his inevitable “Psycho” fate, 
Norma takes a less nuanced 
approach. As always, Vera Farmiga 
turns out a fantastic performance 
amid fucking insanity of Norma’s 
storyline. The titular “Death in the 
Family” is Norma’s mother, who 
we learn was addled with addic-
tion and disease, rendering her 
emotionally unavailable for Nor-
ma’s traumatic childhood. Farmi-
ga perfectly balances the complex 
feelings Norma is dealing with; 
From the way she drowns her own 
son with love, it’s clear she wish-
es she had more than one single 
happy memory of her mother. But 
she’s also viciously uninterested 
in reconnecting with her family in 
the wake of this death. Her broth-
er Caleb (Kenny Johnson, “The 
Shield”) returns to mend relations, 
but Caleb reaches out to Dylan 
instead of Norma, knowing that he 
wouldn’t be welcome around the 
hotel again. Dylan has always been 
the weakest link of “Bates Motel,” 
so this renewed relationship with 
his father might be enough to gal-
vanize his scenes.

The seson premiere of “Bates 

Motel” ends with an image of Nor-
man driving Annika’s car back 
to the motel lot, appearing on the 
screen like a dim speck under-
neath the glowing blue light of 
the vacancy sign. Could he have 
killed Annika? “Bates Motel” 
drops clues, some subtle and some 
flashing as bright as that neon sign, 
then thrusts viewers into the dark 
with a killer cliffhanger. Sure, Mr. 
Hitchcock might have something 
to say about mystery vs. suspense, 
but “Bates Motel” is using every 
tool in its box to gear up for its cra-
ziest season yet.

VINCE VAUGHN
From Page 1A

that they reflect how Vaughn trans-
forms his films. Vaughn takes on 
smaller, sometimes independent 
films and makes them distinguished 
and unique through the fullness and 
life he brings to his characters.

“I like being a part of an origi-

nal idea, there’s something that’s 
exciting about it,” Vaughn said. “I 
do understand when someone is 
moved by something or excited by 
something and they almost want 
to homage it, or they have an inter-
pretation of it. It feels like nowa-
days, in the market place, there 
is a sense that you have to have a 
big IP or franchise in order to cut 
through in the movie theaters. The 
fault of that is that a lot of the char-
acter stuff or people driven stories 
go to the waste side.”

Vaughn’s taste for character-

driven writing isn’t limited to the 
comedy films he’s well known for. 
The 44-year-old actor recently 
finished filming the second sea-
son of “True Detective.”

“I’m kind of returning on some 

level to dramas, which was the 
first thing I broke out with. Now 
that I’ve done comedies, people 
feel like that’s a switch. I feel 
really excited to get on a different 
tone. (Series creator) Nick (Piz-
zolatto) is incredible, the story is 
phenomenal,” Vaughn said.

Though 
the 
similarities 

between Vaughn’s participation 
in “True Detective” and “Unfin-

ished Business” seem initially 
nonexistent, “True Detective” 
is a writer’s TV show. Quiet and 
beautifully structured, as Vaughn 
mentioned, the show parallels 
Vaughn’s character-driven choic-
es in comedy. And it’s original; 
it’s fresh. Vaughn spoke about the 
ongoing trend of remakes in Hol-
lywood — big moneymakers ver-
sus original films.

“A lot of times if something is 

successful, the instinct is to copy 
or repeat it right away. I haven’t 
done a sequel to any of my com-
edies because I’ve always felt you 
need to have a really good idea that 
stands alone in order to put that 
story out versus following up the 
next year with another version of 
that movie and let the fact that the 
movie did well be more important 
than having a good concept for it. 
I think there is a trend to jump on 
something and make a sequel right 
away before there is an original 
idea to suit the characters well.”

In 
“Unfinished 
Business,” 

Vaughn’s character goes on a jour-
ney with the goal of being better 
off than where he started — and 
that’s how Vaughn approaches 
his movies. Vaughn’s choices 
aren’t the big, blockbuster hits 
(though Vaughn would debatably 
make a better Bruce Wayne than 
Ben Affleck), but rather films that 
appear smaller, that rely on the 
writing and that he pushes to the 
next level through his acting and 
character building: the underdog 
films.

For the seniors, happy ending 

on breakable thread

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

It was everything, everything that the 
seniors wanted.

It was meant to be, supposed to be, but 
they lost it.

As the puck sailed into Michigan’s 
zone one final time, the screaming 

crowd stood in stunned silence. 

It was almost destiny, but with 

one 
final 
Michigan 
State 

dump, it suddenly wasn’t.

On a day when the 

Wolverines had a chance 
to sweep their rival, win 

their first Big Ten title and send their seniors off 
with a bang in front of a sold-out crowd, Michigan 
came up short time and again, missing opportuni-
ty after opportunity to send the puck past Spartan 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand, who made 37 saves.

“It’s disappointing,” said Michigan coach Red 

Berenson. “We had an opportunity to do some-
thing that was special, and it didn’t happen. I like 
the way our team played. I don’t know how many 
grade-A scoring chances we had in the game, give 
their goalie credit, give their team credit, but the 
puck wasn’t going in.”

For over two decades, the Wolverines and the 

NCAA Tournament were the perfect pair, side-
by-side through 

Michigan’s Big Ten title hopes 

spoiled by Michigan State

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team was looking for a 
storybook ending to cap off its regular season, but 
the book never got published.

There was one final game — Saturday’s contest 

at Yost Ice Arena, on Senior Day and against its 
in-state rival, a game that seemed as if it could 
handle all the components of a storybook 
ending. The 19th-ranked Wolverines needed 

just one victory to capture the Big Ten regular-

season championship, but Michigan State wouldn’t 
let them etch the final words into their coveted story.

“We had the opportunity to do something special 

and it didn’t happen,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson.

Michigan lost 2-1 against the team it hates losing 

to most. The Spartans threw a pair of villains into 
the Wolverines’ fairytale, and their names are Matt 
DeBlouw and Jake Hildebrand.

Twenty-nine seconds into the third period, 

DeBlouw scored the eventual game-winning 

goal. He was sprung on a breakaway 

thanks to a Wolverine turnover in the 
neutral zone and was able to slip a shot

That feeling of heartbreak

S

omewhere in the locker 
room of Yost Ice Arena, 
where that feeling of 

heartbreak 
hurts the 
most, is a list 
of goals for 
the Michigan 
hockey team.

They’re 

the same 
goals that 
have likely 
been posted 
in that same 
room all 
season: “Protect Yost, win the 
weekend, win the GLI, win the 
Big Ten.”

Saturday night, they had the 

opportunity to accomplish all of 
them.

The Wolverines were at home, 

having won the Great Lakes 
Invitational in December, with a 
chance to sweep Michigan State 
for the Big Ten regular-season 
title. And maybe, in the process, 
silence the criticism that has 
followed them this season.

They faced the pressure that 

comes when an entire season 
comes down to one game, the 
type of pressure you would 
feel sitting on a 17 in blackjack. 
Except, if they lost this hand, 
they would lose everything 
they worked so hard to avoid 
repeating.

They were risking that feeling 

of heartbreak.

* * *

T

wo years ago, when 
Michigan fell apart 
in the regular season 

behind a lackluster defense and 
lack of energy, it fought back into 
the CCHA playoffs for a chance 
to salvage the season. There was 
no chance at an at-large bid into 
the NCAA Tournament. If the 
Wolverines wanted to make it, 
they’d have to win out.

Sitting near the bottom of the 

conference, team after team fell 
to the Wolverines, even the ones 
that had defeated them earlier 
in the season, all the way to the 
conference final. They clawed 
back, but only to fall short in the 
final period.

They cried, then fell silent and 

vowed to never let that feeling 
happen again.

Last year, having started the 

season so well, Michigan fell 
apart at the end of the season, 
when it needed one win in the 
Big Ten Tournament to secure 
its fate in the postseason. The 
Wolverines had just defeated No. 
1 Minnesota the weekend before, 
giving their postseason hopes 
new life.

And for 96 minutes, they 

fought and held on against 

Penn State in the first round of 
the Big Ten Tournament. They 
stopped shot after shot and 
came inches — literally inches 
— away from doing so, only to 
feel that pain 
again. They 
had done 
everything 
they could, but 
they were left 
helpless once 
more.

They cried 

again, said 
even fewer 
words than the last time, and 
once more, they vowed to never 
experience that heartbreak 
again.

* * *

W

hen the final 
horn sounded 
Saturday, they were 

heartbroken once more.

Junior forward Andrew Copp 

bent over with 
his stick on his 
knees, gliding 
from one end 
of the ice to 
the other. 
Michigan 
coach Red 
Berenson and 
the rest of 
the coaching 

staff shuffled off the ice without 
shaking any of the players’ 
hands.

Senior forwards Zach Hyman 

and Travis Lynch skated out to 
the ice to be honored on Senior 

Night, but with forced smiles. 
They hugged teammates, waved 
to the crowd and kissed the ice — 
only out of tradition. They were 
still hurting.

For 60 minutes, the 

Wolverines played perhaps 
some of their best hockey of the 
season. Maybe they could have 
passed the puck more sharply 
or cleared the puck quicker. But 
they attacked the net, held onto 
the puck and didn’t stay in the 
penalty box.

But when Michigan thought 

it had a chance, the Spartans 
were there with bodies flying 
everywhere. Michigan State 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand, 
who has had a quiet season, 
played perhaps his best game, 
as if to personally say, You shall 

not pass.

“I told them they did 

everything they could to 
make it happen,” Berenson 
said. “We had the chance, the 
opportunity.”

There are periods of silence 

when Berenson speaks, not 
because he doesn’t know what to 
say but because it hurts to say it. 
He looks down and around and 
then finally, he says, “It is what 
it is.”

And right now, it’s heartbreak. 

It’s the feeling they have after 
playing one of their best games 
and still losing.

* * *

N

ow, as the Big Ten 
Tournament looms, the 
Wolverines’ past follows 

them once again. They arrive 
at the conference tournament 
needing to win it all to make it to 
the NCAA Tournament.

They vowed to end this 

feeling, never to go back to that 
feeling of heartbreak. It’s a vow 
they’re sick of making, but it’s 
one they’re going to have to 
make once again.

This feeling, whether they 

like it or not, is on them. Next 
weekend, it’s a chance, as 
Berenson puts it, “to salvage our 
so-called status.” It’s time to see 
whether this team is ready to 
break its streak.

Whether they won or not, 

they weren’t headed to the 
NCAA Tournament if they won 
Saturday night. And it won’t 
matter how far they go in the 
tournament, so long as they 
make it.

After 22 years of making the 

postseason followed by two 
consecutive years of missing it, 
the heartbreak has become all 
too familiar.

But it doesn’t have to be.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

The Michigan hockey team has put itself into a now-familiar position: It must win the Big Ten Tournament this weekend to make the NCAA Tournament.

GREG
GARNO

“We had the 
chance, the 
opportunity.”

passion, intensity, and joy.

But the two have been apart 

for nearly three years now, and 
after dropping to its worst start 
to the season in 28 years, Michi-
gan has made another desperate 
attempt to win itself a date with 
the postseason.

No one feels that desperation 

quite like the seniors. They’re 
the only ones who know what 
it’s like to play in the tourna-
ment, making the sudden break-
up all the more painful.

As the game wore on and 

another 
disappointing 
loss 

became more of a reality by the 
second, that desperation could 
be seen from the seniors on the 
ice. Defensemen Andrew Sinelli, 
Mike Chiasson and Brennan 
Serville could be seen delivering 
hits and chasing down passes as 
a part of a unit that surrendered 
just 19 shots.

Senior forwards Zach Hyman 

and Travis Lynch could be seen 
corralling the puck in the cor-
ner, dashing down the ice on 
breakaways 
and 
setting 
up 

shop near Hildebrand’s crease, 
desperately screening and pok-
ing anything that came within 
reach.

It was some of the best hockey 

the fans at Yost Ice Arena had 
seen all season, but after yet 
another disappointing, agoniz-
ing loss that spoiled the seniors’ 
day, the Wolverines’ happy end-
ing is held up high on a break-

able thread as well.

“We put ourselves in a tough 

spot,” Berenson said. “We have 
to work our way out of it. I think 
our team has put everything 
they had into this weekend. 
We went there and had a good 
game in Lansing, and we played 
another good game tonight.

“It’s 
your 

body of work 
during 
the 

year, and it’s 
too 
bad 
it 

comes 
down 

to one game or 
one weekend 
to dictate your 
destiny, 
but 

that’s 
what 

happened.”

Even 
with 

seconds to go, it didn’t seem 
quite real for Michigan. A flur-
ry of shots near the net in the 
closing minutes looked to be 
the sequence that would finally 
break Hildebrand. With Hyman 
and Lynch skating freely all 
around the net and getting 
seemingly open looks, the fans 
rose to their feet, not wondering 
if a senior would rise up to be a 
hero, but which one and when.

But each time, Hildebrand 

was there. After allowing eight 
goals in his previous two stints 
against Michigan, both losses, 
the netminder showed why 
he’s the favorite to be Big Ten 
Goaltender of the Year. The 
breakaways, wrap-arounds and 
one-timers the Wolverines had 
used to become the best offense 
in the nation fell silent when 
they needed them most.

“Sometimes the puck isn’t 

going to go in, and they play 
well defensively,” Hyman said. 
“Unfortunately, they were able 
to capitalize on the little chanc-
es they had. We had a bunch of 
chances, but couldn’t capitalize 
on them.”

With it all on the line, Michi-

gan 
lost 
it, 

and that was 
a tough pill to 
swallow. Most 
fans 
trickled 

out 
of 
Yost 

following the 
devastating 
loss. But those 
who did stay 
celebrated 
a 

senior 
class 

so 
dead-set 

on winning that they had to be 
coaxed into kissing center-ice 
and posing for team photos after 
their final home game, a long-
time Wolverine tradition.

But 
before 
the 
memories 

so close to the team just fade 
away, the seniors will have one 
more shot at a happy ending and 
regain the love of the NCAA 
Tournament. With more goals 
than any team and blowout wins 
over every Big Ten team, the 
Wolverines are more than capa-
ble at one final run in the Big 
Ten Tournament, which begins 
Thursday against Wisconsin in 
Detroit.

“I wouldn’t want to play us 

next week,” Berenson said. “I 
think it’s a good opportunity for 
us to salvage our so-called ‘sta-
tus’ whether it’s in the NCAA 
Tournament or Big Ten status.”

past sophomore goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort.

“You never want to give up 

a goal in the first shift of the 
period, but we had a lot of time to 
come back,” said senior forward 
Zach Hyman. “We pressured 
them really well.”

It wasn’t as if Michigan didn’t 

have enough chances to find the 
equalizer. It had plenty.

With 
6:19 
remaining 
in 

regulation, a loose puck squirted 
out to sophomore forward Tyler 
Motte. He had a wide-open net, 
he ripped a shot, and he saw the 
wide-open net vanish.

Hildebrand shifted from the 

right 
to 
left 

goal post, flung 
his glove in the 
air and Motte’s 
shot somehow 
landed 
in 

leather instead 
of twine.

During the 

final 
minute 

of regulation, 
Hildebrand 
stood tall against Motte once 
more. A rebound opportunity was 
smothered, and the Wolverines 
couldn’t break through with the 
extra attacker despite a lengthy 
stay in the offensive zone.

“Their goalie stood on his head 

and played as well as I’ve seen a 
goalie play this year,” Berenson 
said.

Michigan State led the entire 

game and was sparked by an 
early goal off the stick of forward 
Michael 
Ferrantino. 
Midway 

through the first period, just as 
a Michigan penalty had expired, 
Ferrantino skated through the 
left circle and fired a rising shot 
over Nagelvoort’s left shoulder.

The Wolverines broke through 

just once, as they evened the 
score at one when freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

netted his ninth of the season 
with 7:10 left in the second 
period. Werenski corralled the 
puck at the high slot, paused 
momentarily and fired a shot into 
the top corner.

Shortly after Ferrantino’s goal, 

the Wolverines began to take 
control of the game, flipping the 
switch on its dangerous offense. 
They peppered Hildebrand with 

a 
flurry 
of 

chances.

“Sometimes 

the puck isn’t 
going 
to 
go 

in, 
but 
they 

played 
well 

defensively 
and, 
unfortunately, 
they 
capitalized on 

the little chances that they had,” 
Hyman said. “I mean, that’s the 
name of the game is putting your 
chances in.”

The initial half of the second 

period played to the same tune 
as the final half of the first, 
but Hildebrand continued his 
stout 
performance. 
Michigan 

whizzed a pair of shots wide and 
couldn’t beat Hildebrand even 

in the midst of a stretch where it 
outshot Michigan State 6-0 in the 
first 9:27 of the middle frame.

All evening, the Wolverines 

won the possession battle and 
finished the game with 19 more 
shots than the Spartans. But not 
every ending is a happy one, even 
if all signs point toward such 
a finish and even if Michigan 
deserved one.

“I think our team has put 

everything they had during this 
weekend,” Berenson said. “We 
went down there and played 
a good game in Lansing and 
we played another good game 
tonight, and it didn’t happen.”

Throughout the final month 

of the season, the Wolverines 
controlled their own destiny 
for a Big Ten title, but they fell 
short. A victory one night ago 
in East Lansing set the stage 
for Michigan to win its first 
conference championship since 
2011, but it fell short.

And with a myriad of chances 

to find the goal — and the words 
— that would have been enough 
to compose a happy ending, it fell 
short.

The Wolverines’ storybook 

ending was almost complete, but 
sometimes the most promising of 
storylines don’t pan out. It just 
didn’t happen. Michigan will 
have to settle for a new story — a 
shot at redemption in next week’s 
Big Ten Tournament.

With this fairytale in the 

wastebasket, the Wolverines are 
back to writing once more, but 
writing a new story is better than 
being unable to write anything at 
all.

“We had an 

opportunity to 
do something 

special.”

“Our team has put 

everything they 
had during this 

weekend.”

‘M’ wins rubber match

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

In Saturday’s home opener 

for the Michigan softball team, 
Kent 
State 
pitcher 
Emma 

Johnson dominated. She held the 
Wolverines scoreless, allowing 
just three hits and striking out 
five in a complete-game win.

Michigan couldn’t lay off of 

her tricky rise ball — which was 
the Wolverines’ game plan.

“I bet you my salary that we’re 

going to see Emma Johnson 
again,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins after Saturday’s 
3-0 loss. “That kid is good as 
anyone else I’ve seen. She’s legit.”

Sure 
enough, 
who 
was 

announced 
as 
the 
Golden 

Flashes’ pitcher in the pregame 
introductions 
Sunday? 
None 

other than Emma Johnson.

With a chip on their shoulder 

after losing the home opener, 
Hutchins said that she hoped 
the Wolverines would come 
back Sunday with “a bee in their 
bonnet.”

It’s safe to say Michigan 

delivered, led by 10 strikeouts 
from 
sophomore 
pitcher 

Megan Betsa and two RBI from 
sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christner, winning 4-1.

Through 
the 
first 
three 

innings, Johnson was just as 
effective as Saturday. With a 
lethal rise ball, she racked up five 
strikeouts and forced the third-
ranked Wolverines (24-4) to 
pop out twice. Kent State (12-6) 
then scored first in the top of the 
fourth with a home run by right 
fielder Michele Duffy — her first 
of the season.

Michigan’s first hit of the 

game came in the bottom of 
the fourth inning by way of a 
single by Christner. Two batters 
later, freshman first baseman 
Tera Blanco broke up Johnson’s 
shutout with an RBI single, 
driving in Christner and tying 
the game at one. After junior 
right fielder Kelsey Susalla was 
hit by a pitch, a runner was in 

scoring position for freshman 
catcher Aidan Falk.

Senior catcher Lauren Sweet, 

the usual starter behind the plate 
for the Wolverines, was injured 
on a play running home Saturday, 
so Falk got her first career start 
Sunday. 
With 
the 
freshman 

facing a full count, the Michigan 
crowd roared to life, clapping 
and stomping its feet in hopes 
of a rally, but Johnson picked 
up another strikeout with her 
devastating rise ball.

In the fifth inning, sophomore 

third 
baseman 
Lindsay 

Montemarno led off the inning. 
After working the count full, she 
sent a charge to left field, landing 
near the chalk between fair and 
foul 
territory. 
Montemarano 

ran to second, but the call was 
reversed, sending the crowd and 
Hutchins into a tirade.

After 
Hutchins’ 
argument 

with the third base umpire 
concluded, the fans booed, and 
Hutchins raised her hands up 
and down in approval of the fans’ 
disappointment. 
Montemarano 

struck out on the next pitch.

Two batters later, more drama 

and controversial calls unfolded. 

Junior designated player Mary 
Sbonek stole second and Golden 
Flashes catcher Erika Warren 
tried to throw her out, but the 
errant throw hit the batter, 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Abby 

Ramirez, in the head, causing 
the ball to go behind third base. 
Warren hit Christner in the 
same type of situation in game 
one on Saturday. Sbonek then 
advanced to third but was called 
out, sending Wolverine fans into 
another frenzy.

With the bases loaded and 

tensions rising for Kent State 
in the sixth, Betsa got out of the 
jam by getting Warren to pop out. 
That was when the tide started to 
turn.

“I was trying to be one-pitch 

tougher than they were,” Betsa 
said. “If bases are loaded, I don’t 
try too hard. I don’t try to get the 
strikeout or to get them to swing 
and miss. That’s great, but if they 
put the ball in play and we throw 
the ball to first to get out of the 
inning, that’s just as good.”

Johnson’s effectiveness ended 

in the sixth. With the Wolverines 
up to bat in the subsequent half 
inning, junior center fielder Sierra 

Lawrence led off with a single. 
Four pitches later, Christner hit 
a two-run shot into the right field 
bleachers, giving Michigan a 3-1 
lead.

After a popout, Blanco sent 

a solo home run over the left 
field wall, extending the lead to 
three. While she ran the bases, 
she held one finger up in the air 
in triumph. The Wolverines had 
finally figured Johnson out, thus 
ending her day in the circle.

“I thought we were trying too 

much, and then we finally said, 
get back to see ball, hit ball,” 
Hutchins said.

When Betsa ended the game 

with a strikeout, the Michigan 
fans could finally breathe a sigh 
of relief. Kent State came into 
the series ready to win and got 
one in its first opportunity. After 
that, the Wolverines kicked into 
gear and got their offense going. 
Fans may not have expected 
Kent State to be competitive, 
but Michigan didn’t doubt its 
abilities after Johnson’s stellar 
performance.

“We always have to come out 

and battle,” Blanco said. “It’s kill 
or be killed out here.”

WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
DMR headlines 
championships

By RILEY NELSON

Daily Sports Writer

Two legs into the distance 

medley 
relay, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s track and field team’s 
fate was almost decided by an 
opposing runner’s error.

The Villanova runner fumbled 

a 
baton 
exchange, 
hitting 

Michigan junior Maya Long’s 
hand. Long was able to compose 
herself, however, helping the 
Wolverines’ relay team to a third-
place finish at the NCAA Indoor 
Track and Field Champi

The 
time 
of 
10:58 
in 

Fayetteville, Arkansas is more 
than four seconds faster than its 
previous best time this season.

“We were pretty fired up,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 

McGuire. “I thought we raced to 
our potential. We were ranked 
seventh or eighth, so we came out 
and finished third in the nation. 
That’s a great effort by four 
people.”

The distance medley relay is 

a four-part relay race consisting 
of 
1,200-, 
400-, 
800- 
and 

1,600-meter legs. The runners 
representing 
Michigan 
were 

juniors Shannon Osika, Long, 
Danielle 
Pfeifer 
and 
senior 

co-captain Brooke Handler, in 
that order.

“We put together four much 

more solid legs than we had in 
the previous weeks,” Handler 
said. “We were happy with our 
time as well.”

Stanford 
came 
in 
second 

at 10:53, while Arkansas set a 
facility and meet record with 
a time of 10:51. This was more 
than five seconds faster than 
the previous record, which was 
set by Michigan’s 2013 NCAA 
Championship relay team.

Michigan was also represented 

in Fayetteville by junior Cindy 
Ofili in the 60-meter hurdles. 
Coming 
off 
of 
her 
second 

straight win at the Big Ten 
Championships, Ofili hit a hurdle 
and fell during the preliminaries, 
failing to advance to the finals.

“It 
was 
obviously 
a 
big 

disappointment 
for 
her,” 

McGuire said. “It was not in a 
lack of effort. It was one of those 
things that can unfortunately 
happen.”

One point of discussion prior 

to this weekend was whether 
Pfeifer would compete in the 
individual 
800-meter 
race, 

which she also qualified for. 
After lengthy discussions with 
McGuire, Pfeifer chose not to 
compete individually in order to 
be fresh for the distance medley.

“We wanted to see what we 

could do as a team when we were 
all fresh,” Pfeifer said, “so after 
talking about that we decided that 
it was best for me to scratch the 
individual 800-meter. I’m pretty 
happy with my decision because 
of what we did yesterday.”

In the distance medley relay, 

Pfeifer had the fastest split of any 
800-meter runner in the race.

“I think that’s attributed to 

the fact that she’s a really good 
athlete and was running fresh,” 
McGuire said. “Next year she’ll 
be a senior, so we could decide on 
something different, but I think 
it was something we mutually 
agreed upon.”

For Handler, the weekend 

was particularly special because 
it was the last indoor race of her 
collegiate career.

“I wanted to go out with one of 

my best collegiate races,” Handler 
said. “It was definitely my best 
race of the indoor season.”

She ran a personal best with a 

time of 4:35.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
a 

successful indoor season, taking 
second at the Big Ten Indoor 
Championships. This is also 
the 12th consecutive year that 
Michigan has had All-Americans 
in the distance medley. All four 
members of the 2015 team were 
awarded that honor.

“I thought we made progress, 

getting second in the Big Ten 
and what we did this weekend,” 
McGuire said. “We’re going a 
step in the right direction.”

MEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
Bastien an All-American in heptathlon

By MATTHEW KIPNIS 

Daily Sports Writer

At the Akron Invitational last 

month, junior Steven Bastien 
broke a record that had gone 
untouched for seven years.

When Bastien topped Frank 

Shotwell’s score with a 5,576 point 
total in that heptathlon, it seemed 
that his new record could stay 
at the top of the record book for 
nearly as long as its predecessor.

In reality, it lasted a total of 35 

days.

At 
the 
NCAA 
Indoor 

Championships 
this 
past 

weekend, Bastien earned 5,664 
points to finish in eighth place 
overall, 
becoming 
Michigan’s 

first-ever All-American in the 
heptathlon. In the process, he 
set four new personal records 
in seven events and entered 
Michigan’s all-time top 10 with a 
long jump of 24 feet, 7.25 inches.

“I feel really honored just to 

add to the tradition that Michigan 
had,” Bastien said.

Added Michigan coach Jerry 

Clayton: “Anytime you come into 
the national championship and 
your athletes finish higher then 
where they were ranked coming 
in, that’s a positive step. With 

Steven Bastien ending up as an 
All-American and scoring in the 
top eight (nationally), that’s even 
greater.”

Redshirt junior Derek Sievers 

joined Bastien in Arkansas for 
his first trip to the NCAA Indoor 
Championships. Sievers finished 
11th to earn second team All-
America honors. Even with a 
throw of 60 feet, 5.75 inches — 
sixth-best all-time for Michigan 
indoor throwers — it was Bastien 
making his debut that stole the 
show.

Entering the tournament as 

the 14th seed in the field, Bastien 
surpassed 
almost 
everyone’s 

expectations, except his and his 
coaches’.

Just hours after having set the 

previous record, Bastien knew 
he could do better. Immediately 
following the Akron Invitational, 
Bastien worked with Michigan 
coach Jerry Clayton and assistant 
coach Steven Rajewsky to create 
a plan of attack for the Big Ten 
Indoor 
Championships 
and 

NCAA Indoor Championships.

“As a decathlete, compared 

to people that do just the one 
event, you don’t get a lot of reps,” 
Bastien said. “There is a lot of 
room for improvement because 

you don’t have the time to spend 
on one or two events. Even after 
the first meet, Coach Clayton said 
there was more there, more to 
improve on.”

On the first day, Bastien looked 

ready to prove doubters wrong 
straight out of the gates. In the 
first event, the 60-meter dash, 
Bastien finished in sixth place 
with a time of 7.037 seconds, 
fractions off his personal best.

Bastien then jumped three 

places up the leaderboard to 
third in the second event with his 
record-breaking long jump of 24 
feet, 7.25 inches, but didn’t even 
know it.

“When I landed, I looked at 

the notches for each footmark 
and I misread it,” Bastien said. “I 
thought it wasn’t that good but 
then I saw the number and was 
really happy. Doing well in the 
(60-meter dash), then the long 
jump really helped me carry the 
momentum through.”

Eventually, 
after 
throwing 

a career best in shot put and a 
six feet, 2.25 inches high jump, 
Bastien fell back to eighth, where 
he ended the first day.

Bastien started the second 

day to with a personal-best time 
of 8.51 seconds in the 60-meter 

hurdles, and followed that up 
by breaking his previous best 
mark as a Wolverine in the pole 
vault, clearing 14 feet, 11 inches. 
Despite 
the 
result, 
Bastien 

dropped to ninth, and needed a 
solid performance on the final 
event to finish as a first team All-
American.

Bastien did that and more, 

running the fastest 1,000 meters 
of his career finishing second 
in the 14-man field, by clocking 
2:36.85 and beating his previous 
mark 
by 
more 
than 
seven 

seconds. With the runner-up 
finish, Bastien jumped back into 
eighth and finalized his spot on 
the All-American first team.

“We need to bring more people 

like him to our program to take 
us to the next level,” Clayton said. 
“This is the type of athlete we 
need. He has made great strides 
(since coming to Michigan). I saw 
the athletic ability, but it was just 
putting it together in a heptathlon 
which is what we have been able 
to do.”

Since transferring to Michigan 

from 
Samford 
this 
season, 

Bastien has broken two Michigan 
records in his seven events. When 
he is on the track, no record is 
safe. Not even his own.

BASEBALL
Hits don’t fall as 
‘M’ drops series

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

To win baseball games, you 

need to hit the baseball and the 
ball has to find a hole. Against 
Kansas (8-12) this weekend, 
Michigan (11-8) did only one of 
those two things, as it dropped 
two of its three games in its 
weekend series in Lawrence, 
Kansas.

“Today (we had) some of the 

best at-bats we’ve had all season,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“We hit some of the hardest balls 
we’ve hit all season.”

But two Jayhawk outfielders 

made leaping catches at the wall 
to rob the Wolverines of extra 
bases and countless line drives 
were roped straight into Kansas 
mitts.

The highlight of the weekend 

for the Michigan offense was the 
eighth inning of Saturday’s game 
when it scored three runs to take 
a 4-2 lead that it would not relin-
quish.

Junior left fielder Cody Brud-

er reached on an error to start 
the inning before being brought 
home by senior catcher Kend-
all Patrick’s single. Patrick and 
right fielder Johnny Slater then 
scored off the bat of senior Eric 
Jacobson, who has impressed 
after moving over to shortstop as 
junior shortstop Travis Maezes 
deals with an injury.

Junior 
first 
baseman 
and 

junior closer Jacob Cronenworth 
threw the final two innings Sat-
urday to ensure the Wolverines 
stayed ahead for good.

The main difference between 

the Wolverines’ win on Satur-
day and their two losses — 6-5 on 
Friday and 8-4 on Sunday — may 
have been the starting pitching.

Friday, sophomore left-hander 

Brett Adcock needed 87 pitches 
to make it through four frames, 
allowing five earned runs in the 

process. Adcock walked just two 
batters while striking out three, 
but the Jayhawks had his num-
ber, tagging him for seven hits.

“Brett’s had one bad outing,” 

Bakich said. “They capitalized on 
an inning where they had two-
out RBIs. Brett’s been lights out 
for us these past few weeks.”

Saturday, 
freshman 
right-

hander Ryan Nutof had one of his 
best starts in his young career, 
throwing six strong innings 
while allowing just two earned 
runs and seven total base run-
ners.

“He’s a good pitcher,” Bakich 

said. “When he’s throwing his 
fastball and breaking ball and 
change-up all for strikes, he’s got 
pretty good stuff. He gives us a 
chance to win games.”

In the rubber match Sun-

day, the Wolverines had their 
best pitcher so far this season, 
sophomore right-hander Keith 
Lehmann, on the mound, but he 
lasted just two innings. While he 
didn’t allow a single free pass, he 
was hit hard for six hits and four 
earned runs.

“Keith 
made 
some 
qual-

ity pitches,” Bakich said. “Every-
thing they hit found a hole. They 
didn’t strike out and found a way 
to put the barrel on the ball. You 
have to give them credit for com-
ing out and making contact.”

The weather in Kansas also 

seemed to favor the homestand-
ing Jayhawks.

“There was a jet stream going 

out to right,” Bakich said. “They 
hit a couple balls that way, and we 
hit a lot of balls the wrong direc-
tion.”

After putting together an 

eight-game winning streak over 
Spring Break, the Wolverines 
will try not to let one series that 
got away get them down. They’ll 
attempt to learn from the nega-
tives, try to focus on the positives 
and move on.

Michigan rebounds, 
cruises past Niagara

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

After 
Wednesday’s 

heartbreaking loss to Virginia 
Tech in the waning seconds of 
overtime, the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse team was left picking up 
the pieces in its matchup with 
Niagara on Saturday.

While the Wolverines showed 

the full effects of their midweek 
loss in the first half, adjustments 
at the break proved to be the 
difference as Michigan (4-3) 
cruised to a 15-8 victory.

The Purple Eagles (2-4) had 

no answer to an incredibly 
efficient performance from the 
Wolverines’ 
starting 
midfield 

unit. 
Sophomore 
midfielders 

Anna Schueler, Kim Coughlan 
and Lauren Oberlander combined 
to score 11 of Michigan’s 15 goals 
while failing to clear the ball just 
twice. Successfully maintaining 
possession while in transition 
was a huge boost for the 
Wolverines and built confidence 
for the team to attack.

“We worked on (clearing) a lot 

in practice, and it finally clicked 
for us,” Oberlander said. “We 
spread out, communicated with 
each other and kept our heads 
up so we were able to find each 
other on the attack. Getting the 
fast break was an important part 
of our game.”

Outside of Schueler’s three 

goals in the first half, the 
Wolverines came out shaky in 
the opening period. Michigan’s 
defense was forced to take on 
more pressure than it expected 
and committed 11 more fouls 
than Niagara in the first half.

On 
the 
other 
end, 
the 

Wolverine 
attackers 
were 

constantly 
disconnected 

from one another. Michigan 
committed 12 turnovers, and 
despite outshooting the Purple 
Eagles, 15-8, the teams went into 
the break knotted at five.

“We 
want 
quality 

opportunities, but in the first 
half, we weren’t being as smart 
as we should have been,” said 
sophomore attacker Tess Korten. 

“And that’s why our shooting 
percentage was so low.”

Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 

Ulehla sensed from the poor 
period that her young team 
was 
emotionally 
drained 

from 
Wednesday’s 
loss 
and 

struggling 
because 
of 
the 

short week of preparation. But 
Ulehla challenged her team 
at halftime to change its work 
ethic and try to use whatever 
remaining energy it had to find a 
breakthrough.

Coming 
out 
of 
halftime, 

the 
Wolverines 
looked 
like 

a different team. It took 64 
seconds for Michigan to find 
the opening goal of the period 
off Oberlander’s stick. Then, the 
Wolverines went on a 4-0 run, 
displaying their highest level of 
confidence of the day.

While 
Michigan’s 
midfield 

and especially Coughlan — who 
scored four of her five goals in the 
second half — continued to make 
all the right plays, the Wolverine 
attackers picked up their game. 
Ulehla was impressed by how 
her attack unit calmed down and 
distributed the ball.

Shooting efficiently was the 

largest area of improvement for 
Michigan in the second half. The 
Wolverines netted 10 of their 17 
shots in the period.

“The first half, we had a lot of 

great looks, but we shot right to 
the goalie’s stick,” Ulehla said. 
“They made the adjustment in 
the second half and shot a lot 
better. We’re still trying to find 
the balance between going hard 
to goal and getting opportunities 
while being able to finish.”

Michigan’s 
adversity 
and 

ability to adjust quickly could 
be the young team’s biggest 
takeaway 
from 
Saturday’s 

matchup. When their gameplan 
wasn’t clicking in the first half, 
the Wolverines were able to make 
the necessary changes to bring 
together a disconnected team.

By the end of the Niagara 

game, Michigan appeared to 
have put back together all the 
pieces that shattered in a tough 
week.

WOMEN’S LACROSSE

Season ends without NIT

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team’s 
season 
is 

over. After a 16-16 finish, the 
Wolverines failed to secure an 
NIT bid Sunday night, getting 
beaten out for at-large bids by 
teams like Alabama, George 
Washington and Arizona State.

After a rough showing in 

non-conference 
play 
and 
a 

pair of devastating midseason 
injuries, the Wolverines showed 
flashes of promise in the second 
half of the season, making a late 
push for a postseason bid.

A Feb. 22 win over Ohio 

State, in particular, proved the 
Wolverines were capable of 
contending with postseason-
caliber teams, even without 
two of their leading scorers: 
junior guard Caris LeVert and 
sophomore 
guard 
Derrick 

Walton Jr.

But a season-long string of 

close 
losses 
kept 
Michigan 

from a postseason bid, starting 
with a Nov. 25 loss to eventual 
NCAA Tournament No. 1 seed 
Villanova in Brooklyn, New 
York. 
Then 
came 
missteps 

against teams like New Jersey 
Institute of Technology and 

Eastern Michigan, and finally, 
the 
late-game 
ineptitude 

continued against Big Ten foes 
like Illinois, Wisconsin and 
Michigan State.

“You don’t go to tournaments 

when you just come close so 
many times,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “You’ve got 
to win more games, and you’ve 
got to do better than we did, and 
that’s the fact.”

While the Wolverines, who 

finished just on the wrong 
side 
of 
the 

NIT 
bubble, 

would 
have 

been 
strong 

candidates 
for a bid to 
lower-tier 
postseason 
tournaments 
like the CIT 
or the CBI, 
Beilein said weeks ago that 
Michigan would only pursue 
opportunities in the NIT or 
NCAA Tournament.

Beilein told his team its 

fate in a mass text, he said 
Sunday night. Junior guard 
Spike Albrecht was the first 
to respond. He replied, “I 
wish next season was here 
tomorrow.”

The end of Michigan’s season, 

though, is ill-timed, as the post-
injury iteration of the Wolverines 
seemed to find their stride in the 
season’s final weeks.

Freshman 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins 
emerged 
as 
a 

backcourt 
force, 
alongside 

nascent 
scoring 
threat 
and 

fellow freshman Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman.

Freshman 
forward 
Ricky 

Doyle put up an impressive 
performance 
against 

Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky in 
the teams’ Friday clash, which 
eliminated 
Michigan 
from 

the Big Ten Tournament, and 
Albrecht and senior forward 
Max Bielfeldt took up their 
newfound responsibilities as 
leaders on and off the court in 
stride.

And 
perhaps 
most 

importantly, 
after 
a 
rough 

start to the season, sophomore 
forward Zak Irvin emerged 
again as a key component of the 
Wolverines’ future. In the final 
weeks, he displayed previously 
unseen potential on the glass 
and 
defensively, 
perfect 

complements to his already 
documented shooting skills and 
newfound ability to put the ball 
on the floor.

“In the Big Ten, we know 

each 
other 

pretty 
well,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“But 
usually, 

when we get 
out 
of 
the 

conference 
at 

this time of the 
year, we’ve had 
some success.”

Nonetheless, 
Beilein 
was 

encouraged by his team’s late-
season resilience, and by Irvin’s 
improvement in particular.

“He is truly becoming a 

multi-position player,” Beilein 
said. “Last year, (he was) just a 
shooter, and a freshman type of 
defender, certainly not a passer 
or a rebounder. And now, he’s 
become a passer, a rebounder, a 
better shooter, a scorer.”

With no more games to be had 

until November, the Wolverines 
will shift from a 20-hours-per-
week schedule to just a two-
hour weekly slate.

Off the court, attention will 

turn to the status of junior 
guard Caris LeVert, who has 
been projected as a mid-first 
round pick in the NBA Draft but 
has yet to announce whether 
he’ll return to Ann Arbor for his 
senior season. The deadline to 
declare draft entry is April 25.

Beilein and Bielfeldt have also 

indicated that the latter’s status 
is up in the air, and that the two 
will meet in the coming weeks 
to 
discuss 
their 
respective 

options and decide whether a 
potential fifth year for “Moose” 
is mutually agreeable.

Wisconsin holds off upset 
bid in Big Ten Tournament

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO 
— 
Even 
when 

Aubrey Dawkins finally took off 
his jersey and started the laundry 
pile in the center of the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s locker 
room, there were no tears.

There 

were 
long 

faces, and 
moments 
the Wolverines wished they 
could have back, but no real 
regrets. Michigan made it closer 
than anyone would have expect-
ed against No. 1 seed Wisconsin, 
even if the 71-60 final score didn’t 
reflect it.

After an emphatic win over Illi-

nois on Thursday, Michigan came 
out with similar fire to face Wis-
consin on Friday. The Wolverines 
ran the floor, they worked the ball 
around and they shot well. But 
none of it was enough to knock off 
the top-seeded Badgers.

Led by a dominant perfor-

mance inside by Frank Kamin-
sky and Sam Dekker, Wisconsin 
pulled away late to beat the Wol-
verines, eliminating them from 
the Big Ten Tournament.

“We gave them our all,” said 

freshman guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman. “They’re a 
great team, but I think we played 
well against them. We just didn’t 
come out with the ‘W.’ ”

But the Wolverines didn’t go 

quietly. With 6:09 remaining, 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
sank a 3-pointer from the wing 
to tie the game at 54. Playing 
against a bigger, more experi-
enced Wisconsin team, Michigan 
was holding its own.

There were occasional bouts 

of Badger dominance in the post, 
but they always seemed to be 
followed by spurts of lights-out 
shooting by the Wolverines.

For a moment, the heavily pro-

Wisconsin crowd at the United 

Center even got nervous. Fresh-
man forward Aubrey Dawkins 
flushed a put-back dunk to give 
Michigan a 42-41 lead with 12:52 
to play, and freshman guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahk-

man picked up a turnover and 
brought it coast-to-coast for a fin-
ger roll seconds later.

But Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan 

called a timeout, settled his team 
and got the results he was look-
ing for. Forward Duje Dukan tied 
the game with a triple out of the 
timeout, and Wisconsin relied on 
its post game the rest of the way.

“They did a good job weather-

ing the storm,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “They just countered our 
runs and it was hard to guard 
them … their length, how tall 
they are and they’re a great pass-
ing team as well as a great shoot-
ing team.”

Even in a loss, Irvin looked 

phenomenal for the Wolverines. 
He had 21 points and 11 rebounds 
in the loss, and although he 
missed a pair of late free throws, 
the game was already out of hand 
at that point. He hit mid-range 
jumpers with ease and pulled 
down rebounds at an astounding 
rate. He found open teammates 
and disrupted passes on defense, 
but he couldn’t do enough to 
match the Badgers.

Kaminsky and Dekker used 

their size to back down Michi-
gan’s forwards all the way down 
to the basket, where they usually 
got an easy layup, if not an offen-
sive board. The Badgers out-
rebounded Michigan 34-19, 12-4 
on the offensive glass.

“They have a variety of post 

moves that it’s tough to stop, 
especially with their height,” 
said senior forward Max Bielf-
eldt. “It’s tough to double because 
they have so many lethal shoot-
ers waiting out there behind the 
3-point line.”

For most of the first half, 

though, Wisconsin went cold 

from the perimeter, and Michi-
gan was able to set the pace of the 
game. They sped Wisconsin up 
in transition and, for the first 16 
minutes, they were able to limit 
them outside.

Junior guard Spike Albrecht 

showed off a smooth jumper at 
the outset, drilling a turnaround 
jumper in traffic to give Michi-
gan a 13-9 lead seven minutes in. 
Bielfeldt came up with a big block 
on Hayes under the basket, open-
ing up a 3-pointer by Irvin that 
stretched the lead to seven.

But that’s when the Badgers 

started to get going. They cut the 
deficit to 16-13 and looked to be 
hitting their stride.

Irvin and Albrecht hit a pair 

of back-to-back triples minutes 
later, stretching Michigan’s lead 
to nine, the widest it would get all 
day. But even that wasn’t able to 
hold off a Wisconsin rally at the 
end of the half, and ultimately, at 
the end of the game.

Down the stretch, the Bad-

gers were composed, hitting free 
throws and making easy layups 
to prevent any chance for a Mich-
igan comeback.

‘M’ captures regular-season title

By CINDY YU

Daily Sports Writer

Inside the Donald R. Shepherd 

Training Center, where the No. 6 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team practices, mason jars with 
the names of each gymnast are 
neatly aligned before a large wall 
of windows.

The jars represent a reward 

system 
to 
further 
motivate 

and incentivize the athletes to 
excel both in and out of the gym 
throughout the season. After 
each meet, a gymnast is reward-
ed with a marble every time she 
scores a 9.900 or higher on an 
event or sticks a landing.

At the Big Five meet on Sat-

urday, three marbles were given 
out on the final rotation, vault, 
the event where Michigan has 
its lowest team average (49.260) 
and national ranking (tied for 
No. 12).

After trailing No. 12 Penn 

State (6-3 Big Ten, 14-3 overall) 
the entire meet, the Wolverines 
were able to not only surpass the 
Nittany Lions, 197.000-196.650, 
to win the Big Ten regular-sea-
son title, but also record their 
season-best total of 49.525 on 
vault. In addition, they earned a 
berth into the evening session of 
the Big Ten Championships.

Junior Austin Sheppard com-

pleted a powerful Yurchenko 
full to match her season-best 
score of 9.900 from the previ-
ous week. Leading the team 
were sophomore Nicole Artz 
and senior Sachi Sugiyama, who 
also finished top two in the all-
around. Each scored 9.950 to tie 
Minnesota junior Lindsay Mable 
for first place on the event.

Artz nearly stuck her Yurch-

enko full to put up a career high 
on the event, whereas Sugiyama 
extended her streak of scoring at 
least 9.900 on the event to five 
consecutive meets. The Keller, 
Texas native looks to pick up her 
second Big Ten vault title next 
week.

Michigan will have the home 

crowd advantage at the Big Ten 
Championships inside Crisler 
Center, but at the Sports Pavil-
ion in Minneapolis, the team 
was able to recreate a home floor 

advantage of its own.

“It was time to hold nothing 

back,” Sugiyama said. “I’m sur-
prised any of us had voices after 
screaming and yelling, and just 
really putting all of our energy 
into each other and into each 
vault.”

Another 
standout 
perfor-

mance on vault came from senior 
Brooke Parker, who scored a 
career-best 9.875. Competing in 
the leadoff position, the captain 
set the tone for the rest of the 
lineup that was highlighted by 
clean landings.

Prior to the stellar vault rota-

tion, Michigan overcame some 
nerves and uncharacteristic per-
formances that put them in dan-
ger of not securing the win.

“We didn’t have falls, but we 

were not as crisp and as good as 
we could have been,” said Michi-
gan coach Bev Plocki. “We have 
to make sure that as we get into 
the championship part of the 
season, we go out there and com-
pete aggressively from the very 
first routine to the last one.”

The Wolverines started on the 

uneven bars, where their scores 
ranged from 9.775 to 9.850. 
Under tight scoring circum-
stances, they totaled 49.125 after 
the first rotation.

“We weren’t at prime form 

as we had been in the past, but I 
think that we just got a little ner-
vous and were a little tentative 
on our handstands and our land-
ings,” Sugiyama said.

As they moved to the balance 

beam, Artz scored the team’s 
sole 9.900 on the event. Ranked 
No. 4 in the NCAA, she showed 
consistency by putting up her 
sixth consecutive score of at 
least 9.900 on beam and was able 
to tie Iowa sophomore Mollie 
Drenth for first place.

At the halfway mark, Penn 

State led Michigan, 98.550-
98.325.

Before competing on floor 

exercise and vault, the Wolver-
ines had a bye that reenergized 
them in preparation of the two 
power events.

Though there was inconsis-

tent scoring on floor, the season-
low total of 49.150 may not have 
accurately portrayed the actual 
performances.

Sugiyama and Parker led the 

team with scores of 9.925 and 
9.875, respectively. Sugiyama 
added three marbles to her jar 
after sticking two tumbling 
passes and matching her career 
high score for the third week in 
a row. Parker nailed her unique 
routine in which she sets up 
her tumbling passes with just 

a round-off rather than adding 
a back handspring connection, 
as most gymnasts do, to build 
momentum into her tumbling 
passes.

Though the team is happy 

with the outcome of the regular 
season, it sees the Big Five meet 
as more of a warm-up for Big Ten 
Championships on Saturday.

“It’s really great that we were 

able to win and become regular-
season champions, but our main 
focus will be next weekend,” 
Parker said.

Joining Michigan (9-0 Big 

Ten, 12-2 overall) and Penn State 
in the evening session will be 
No. 20 Minnesota, while Iowa 
and Rutgers will compete in the 
afternoon session. No. 9 Nebras-
ka, No. 13 Illinois and Ohio State 
also qualified into the evening 
session at the other Big Five 
qualifying meet, implying Mary-
land and Michigan State will 
compete in the earlier session.

While Michigan made history 

last year by becoming the first 
team to win the Big Ten Cham-
pionships from the afternoon 
session, the team was relieved to 
not have to be put in a difficult 
situation again.

The jars are getting full, but 

there are still plenty of marbles 
to earn.
