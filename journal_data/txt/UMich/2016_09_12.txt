On August 4, Nadine Jawad, a 

Ford junior at the University of 
Michigan, received a text on the 
lawn of Magdalen’s campus at the 
University of Oxford, holding her 
phone in one hand and playing 

with a piece of grass in the other.

“God, my phone is blowing up 

because of that stabbing,” she said. 
“It’s like, I’m fine, mom.”

The incident happened earlier 

that day in London, a city an hour 
and a half from Oxford by bus. The 
perpetrator had knifed victims 
indiscriminately 
near 
Russell 

Square. Among the five injured, 

one woman — an American tourist 
— was killed.

Darlene 
Horton, 
64, 
was 

traveling with her husband who 
was teaching abroad when she was 
killed.

Other American students on the 

lawn, sitting next to her, started 
checking their phones too,

The School of Music, Theatre, & Dance hosted a noontime carillion recital in 
remembrance of 9/11 at Burton Memorial Tower on Sunday.

Fifteen years later, Sara 

Frost, School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance senior and New York 
native, remembers being picked 
up by her father just two hours 
after her first day of first grade 
began, on September 11, 2001.

Frost was in Manhattan 

on 9/11 when the al-Qaeda 
terrorist group coordinated a 
series of attacks by hijacking 
passenger airlines — two of 
which hit and later collapsed 
the World Trade Center North 
and South Towers in New York 
City.

Confused and unsure of what 

was happening, Frost and her 
father went to a local market on 
their way home.

“I have a stark memory of 

just rows and rows and rows of 
empty shelves, which was kind 
of crazy — it was only probably 
about three hours after the 
planes hit, they hit about 9:30 in 
the morning — and already the 
shelves were just bare,” Frost 
said. “In terms of imagery, 
that’s something that, just 

empty shelves, has stuck with 
me because no one knew what 
was going on.”

Two thousand nine hundred 

seventy-seven people died as a 
result of the attacks, including 
18 alumni of the University of 

Michigan.

“Even those of us who 

are new here, recalling our 
experience of the national 
trauma in other parts of the 
country, now share in the 
collective bereavement of the 
University of Michigan family,” 
said then-University President 
Mary Sue Coleman at a 2002 

ceremony honoring the victims.

Though 
the 
attacks 

happened when most current 
University 
undergraduates 

were in elementary school, the 
events still have a lasting impact 
— for some, personally, and for 
others, as part of broader shifts 
in public perception.

“That day has always stayed 

really fresh and really kind of 
visceral in my mind,” Frost said. 
“Even though I was so young, 
the images that one associates, 
it’s just really right there at the 
forefront of my brain, especially 
today.”

Beyond the personal, one of 

the bigger impacts of that day 
was on public opinion.

Following 
the 
attacks, 

University researchers from 
the Institute of Social Research 
found in their “How Americans 
Respond” 
survey 
that 
half 

of 
respondents 
were 
more 

trusting of the government 
in late 2001 than just one 
year earlier, helping create 
attitudes reflective of increased 
patriotism 
and 
community 

among fellow citizens as well.

“The HAR survey results 

Fifteen years later, effects of 9/11 still 
apparent for University students

Lasting impacts remain in public perception

About 
25 
families 
and 

individuals gathered on the 
University of Michigan’s Ingalls 
Mall to listen to a 9/11 memorial 
recital Sunday. Theconcert was 
a performance of the carillon 
bells, which are housed in 
Burton Tower and controlled 
by a series of levers and pedals. 
The recital took place at noon.

Tiffany 
Ng, 
assistant 

professor of carillon, organized 
the concert and performed. Ng 
said she felt this recital was part 
of her duty to the community.

“As University carillonist, 

playing both for the campus 
and the community, I strongly 
feel that it’s my responsibility 
on days like this to provide a 
place of reflection and a place of 

commemoration,” she said.

She added that given the 

carillon’s ability to portray a 
series of emotions, memorials 
like this are an important part 
of the purpose of the carillon as 
an instrument.

“I think that’s one of the roles 

of the carillon, that we don’t just 
peal for joyous occasion and to 
accompany people’s lunchtime 
breaks, but that we also bring 
a seriousness and solemnity 
to the campus soundscape for 
those days of memorial, when 
we remember in particular the 
first responders who all over the 
country, every day, are putting 
themselves on the line for us,” 
Ng said.

The recital opened with a 

performance by Ann Arbor 
Fire Chief Larry Collins, who 
rang the “Last Alarm.” This 
involved the ringing of the 

largest carillon bell three times, 
symbolizing the three rings of 
a fire station’s bell to signal the 
end of the fire to memorialize 
the first responders who lost 
their lives on Sept. 11.

Chief Collins, who has been 

in his current office for two 
years, said it was a unique and 
moving experience for him.

“I can say I have never done 

anything like this before,” he 
said. “I was really honored to be 
asked to participate.”

He added that the memorial 

was an effective way to honor 
the past and the tragedy 15 
years ago.

“It means a lot to the 

community; it means a lot to the 
first responders,” Collins said. 
“Time has a way of diminishing 
the impact of tragic events 
that transpired, and it’s really 
appropriate, I think, to give 

pause and reflect on what 
transpired.”

After the “Last Alarm,” 

Ng performed several pieces 
on the carillon. The first was 
“In Memoriam — September 
11, 2001,” which composer 
John Courter composed a 
few days after the attacks 
in 2001. Ng said she chose 
the other pieces based on 
the sound of this particular 
piece.

“I chose other pieces 

that were in a similar style, 
of 
magnificent, 
resonant 

and 
mournful 
music, 

interspersed with a couple 
more lyrical pieces and a 
piece that hopefully gives 
people hope, ‘Imagine,’ ” 
she said.

Ng also noted that the 

memorial was important 
to her personally, having 
started her undergraduate 
studies at Yale University 
shortly before the attack in 
New York.

“It was sort of the first 

thing that happened to

Students display 2,977 American flags on 
Diag to honor, remember 9/11 victims

On 
Sunday, 
the 
15th 

anniversary 
of 
the 
attacks 

on Sept. 11, the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of Young 
Americans 
for 
Freedom 

organized their annual tribute 
on the Diag.

The display of 2,977 American 

flags — which represent each 
loss of life from the tragedy 
— attracted the attention of 
students, faculty and members 
of the Ann Arbor community. 

LSA junior Dominic Stanchina, 
vice chairman of YAF, noted 
the unique qualities of his 
organization’s tribute.

“It’s attention-getting,” he 

said. “It’s a visually stimulating 
piece so we can catch people off 
guard. They see almost 3,000 
flags for 3,000 victims and it 
(makes) them pause.”

YAF 
secretary 
Derek 

Loewen, an LSA junior, said the 
need for the commemoration 
is especially relevant in a time 
when the threat of terrorism 
still persists.

“It happened 15 years ago 

and people are already starting 
to forget about the events, 
when that sort of terrorism is 
still relevant today,” he said. 
“We want to remember and pay 
respects to those that did lose 
their lives, but also to remind 
people that there is still an 
active threat today and we can’t 
lose sight of that.”

Men’s Glee Club hosts contest to 
find new song lyrics for bicentenial

Winning submission to be performed during 
November 2017 festivities

EMILY MIILLER 
Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

Men’s Glee Club is preparing 
early 
for 
the 
University’s 

bicentennial 
celebration, 

launching a contest earlier this 
month for a lyricist for a new 
song they plan to perform at 
the November 2017 festivities.

All students, alumni, and 

faculty members are eligible 
to submit to the contest. It 
will close on November 15th, 
after which a committee of 
the Glee Club’s director, the 
song’s composer and student 
members of the Glee Club will 
choose the winning lyrics. 
The song will be added to a 
Michigan 
songbook, 
which 

contains 
all 
the 
Michigan 

songs ever written including 
“The 
Victors” 
and 
other 

traditions.

Eugene Rogers, associate 

director 
of 
choirs 
and 

conducting with School of 
Music, Theater, Dance and 
the director of the Men’s Glee 
Club, said there is a precedent 
for this type of contest at the 
University, tracing back to the 
alma mater, “Yellow and Blue.”

“Charles Mills Gayley wrote 

the very first Michigan song, 
the alma mater,” he said. “He 
responded to a student ad and 
received twenty dollars for 
writing the alma mater as we 
know today. And that’s the 
case for a lot of our Michigan 
songs.”

After the committee has 

chosen the lyrics for the new 
song, Kristin Kuster, professor 
of composition with SMTD, 
will compose a piece of music 
to accompany them.

Rogers said Kuster is the 

first woman to compose for 
the Men’s Glee Club and add 
to the compilation of Michigan 
songs.

“So that’s for us really a 

triple excitement because we 
have a brand new text, a brand 
new piece written by a new 
composer, as well as the first 
female professor to compose 
it,” Rogers said.

Kuster noted she is only 

the second woman to receive 
tenure in the Composition 
Department at the University 
and said she is honored that 
the Glee Club asked her to 
write the piece.

“I am grateful to be part 

of this important milestone 
in 
the 
Men’s 
Glee 
Club’s 

commissioning 
history,” 

Kuster said. “I am committed 
to 
advocating 
for 
the 

underrepresented composers 
in our contemporary classical 
music scene; namely, female 
composers 
and 
composers 

of color. My hope is that my 
presence 
in 
commissioning 

projects such as this will help 
transform our field into a more 
inclusive, and therefore more 
enriched culture of music 
making.”

She said she will have 

ample inspiration to help her 
compose the song, coming 
particularly from students.

“This opportunity to write 

again for our Men’s Glee Club 
is thrilling, and I am excited,” 
Kuster said. “The inspiration 
for writing music for this group 
for this occasion surrounds us 
on our campus: it is exuded 
by all of our students, across 
every discipline.”

The piece, she added, will be 

inspired by a series of emotions 

she’s oberved on campus.

The expressions of nostalgia, 

pride, and/or camaraderie that 
emerge from this new piece 
will be dependent on the lyrics 
we choose, yet also will drench 
every single note on the page,” 
she said. “All of these feelings 
will 
inevitably 
be 
present 

because I adore this place.”

This new Michigan song, 

once completed, will premier 
at the Glee Club’s spring 
concert in April. They will 
also perform the new song 
during their annual spring 
tour, which has a bicentennial 
theme this year. Finally, it 
will be performed as a part of 
the University’s bicentennial 
celebrations in November 2017.

SMTD 
senior 
Patrick 

Kiessling, president of the 
Glee Club, said he was looking 
forward to participating in 
this new part of the Glee Club’s 
repertoire.

“To 
be 
commissioning 

and helping create a new 
Michigan song with the Glee 
Club, that will be in this 
Michigan 
songbook 
and 
a 

part of the Glee Club and the 
University’s history for the 
next years to come, is truly a 
unique privilege,” Kiessling 
said. “We’re really excited to 
be writing the first chapter of 
this new song’s story with the 
Glee Club.”

The Glee Club sings a few 

selections from the Michigan 
songbook 
at 
their 
end-of-

semester 
concerts, 
and 

Kiessling 
said 
finding 
out

concerts.

Misogyny doesn’t have to win
L

ast month, presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton made history by 
becoming the first female presidential 

nominee from a major 
political 
party 
— 
an 

enormous 
milestone 

in the fight for gender 
equality in America. But 
as we celebrate this important victory, we 
must not fall victim to complacency. The 
battle is not yet won. Although Clinton has 
made “18 million cracks” in the glass ceiling, 
the falling glass may just reveal a titanium 
plate awaiting us beyond.

Don’t get me wrong — a Trump presidency 

will likely be catastrophic for women’s rights. 
However, electing the first female president 
will not solve our problems overnight. 
Misogyny has already reared its ugly head 
during this election cycle, evidenced in 
shouts of “Lock her up!” at the Republican 
National Convention and “Trump that bitch!” 
bumper stickers. Even if Clinton is elected in 
November, these voices will not fade away 
quietly — and they may even worsen.

A few weeks ago, I found myself on a 

10-hour car ride to my grandmother’s 
house and decided to start listening to 
Malcolm Gladwell’s excellent new podcast, 
“Revisionist History,” to kill the time. 
During his first episode, I was compelled 
by Gladwell’s discussion of the sociological 
phenomenon of “moral licensing” and found 
it alarmingly relevant to today’s presidential 
election. According to an article from 
Stanford University, moral licensing “occurs 
when past moral behavior makes people 
more likely to do potentially immoral things 
without worrying about feeling or appearing 
immoral.” We have already seen this concept 
in action with the noticeable increase in 
blatant racism throughout the country 
since the election of President Obama. 
To put it simply, people tend to feel more 
comfortable openly making racial comments 
or jokes because, in their minds, they couldn’t 
possibly be racist if they helped elect the first 
Black president.

Disturbingly, a number of our international 

friends, including Brazil, Germany, Poland, 
Turkey, France, Canada, Australia and — 
until Teresa May’s election following the 
Brexit fallout — the United Kingdom, have 
elected a female head of state once, and then 

never again. In our own country, despite 
women gaining the right to vote in 1920, we 
still only have 20 females in the Senate and 84 
in the House of Representatives. This only 
makes up about 20 percent of each chamber, 
even 
though 
women 
constitute 
50.9 

percent of the U.S. population according 
to the U.S. Census Bureau. If Clinton 
wins the presidency this fall, we must not 
allow ourselves to fall victim to this same 
pattern. The door cannot close behind her 
for the millions of capable, passionate and 
competent women that can surely follow in 
her footsteps.

Unfortunately, misogyny is an ingrained 

part of our culture. It is not likely to slip 
away easily. If we elect the first female 
president in November, the misogyny will 
grow stronger and uglier. She will almost 
certainly work twice as hard to earn the 
respect of both her government colleagues 
and the general public. She will almost 
certainly receive more hateful comments, 
challenges 
to 
her 
temperament 
and 

credibility and watchful eyes critiquing 
her every move than any other American 
president in recent history. While it will be a 
necessary and historical milestone, the first 
female U.S. president will face her fair share 
of difficulty.

This all being said, moral licensing is 

likely not a conscious decision. Although I 
am certain that a few bad apples spoil the 
bunch, I refuse to believe that most people 
are inherently bad. Most of the time, we 
don’t intend to offend others. And this is 
all the more reason to remain diligent in 
the fight for gender equality. If we get too 
comfortable, the louder and angrier voices 
win. If Clinton takes office this fall, we need 
to challenge those voices that seek to put 
her down based solely on her gender.

If we fight together, moral licensing 

doesn’t have to win.

Misogyny doesn’t have to win.
Hate and anger don’t have to win.
We need to ensure that the door remains 

open not only for our sons and brothers to 
reach their fullest potential, but also for our 
incredible daughters and sisters.

Politics and mechanical reproducability
T

hroughout 
the 
ongoing 

election cycle, I have been 
made acutely aware of our 

national media’s 
tendency 
to 
remove 

politicians from 
their histories, 
forgetting 
the 

ways in which 
politicians have 
demonstrably 
impacted 
our 
lives 

and 
focusing 

instead on their 
words, 
their 

outfits and their 
“personalities” 
(an 
idea 
that, 

given the extremely limited access 
we have to these people’s lives, I 
question outright).

These 
figures, 
then, 

become nothing more than TV 
characters 
whom 
we 
watch, 

judge, mock, make into memes, 
etc. And why should we care 
about 
two 
characters 
whom 

the heavy majority of us find 
untrustworthy 
and 
corrupt? 

Why should we be moved to 
action? We already have Don 
Draper, 
SpongeBob 
and 
the 

Gilmore Girls to worry about. 
And 
I 
actually 
trust 
them. 

Predictably, we turn off the TV 
when these political figureheads 
appear, leaving us apathetic and 
unamused. 

This notion of the media 

dehistoricizing objects is not a 
new one — and I think it’s fair to 
refer to our political figures in 
this way because, for most of us, 
they will never be anything more 
than images on our screen.

In his formative 1936 essay, 

“The Work of Art in The Age of 
Its Mechanical Reproducibility,” 
Walter Benjamin discusses the 
effects of the emerging film 
industry on its contemporary 
audience. He notes that sharp, 
clear reproductions of original 
images have never been more 
easily attained.

Before film, art could still 

be replicated. The difference, 
according to Benjamin, lies in 
film’s ability to “place the copy of 
the original in situations which 
the original itself cannot attain.” 
And while the reproduced piece 
might otherwise feel and look like 
the original, Benjamin asserts 
that this process of reproduction 
will inherently leave the copy 
lacking authenticity. The original 
piece, Benjamin claims, maintains 
a certain aura obliterated with 
the new capability to endlessly, 
relentlessly 
replicate 
the 

object. This process, in effect, 

deconstructs 
the 
concept 
of 

originality all together — what 
is an “original” if it will always 
be placed into some new context 
the object could never attain by 
itself?

Think of your favorite Drake 

“Hotline Bling” meme. Is the 
video itself the original, or is it 
that meme, which puts Drake 
into an entirely new conversation 
with some other idea — maybe 
an inside joke between you and 
your friends? Doesn’t that meme 
become the original object? Every 
time we put something into this 
sort of new context, are we not 
recreating an original? But how 
could an original be recreated?

Our national media enacts this 

same method of removing objects 
from 
their 
larger 
historical 

context, thereby obliterating the 
sense of the original. Just as a TV 
character might evolve with each 
episode of its show, politicians 
become new figures every time we 
hear about them, in new contexts 

that operate singularly, neglecting 
to address their larger histories.

An 
example: 
Michael 

Bloomberg, who instituted racist 
and unconstitutional stop-and-
frisk policing in New York City 
while mayor, spoke in prime time 
at the 2016 Democratic National 
Convention. 
I 
was 
shocked 

Bloomberg was allowed to speak, 
especially at a convention for a 
party that claims to be the voice 
of marginalized people in this 
country. Liberal media outlets, 
in anticipation of Bloomberg’s 
speech, described him as “the 
nation’s leading independent and 
a 
pragmatic 
business 
leader.” 

And, because of his career as a 
businessman, Bloomberg’s pro-
Clinton sentiments would prove 
that Trump, even among his 
colleagues, is disliked.

Here, we see Bloomberg lifted 

out of the muck of his history, 

without a stain, in order to further 
the Democratic Party’s message. 
But we must remain skeptical 
of this, to examine our political 
figures’ histories and policies, 
because these are the ways in 
which they actually impact us. 

At the convention, we do not 

even need to listen to Bloomberg’s 
words to examine his efforts 
to detach himself from his own 
history. The mayor of Atlanta, 
Ga., 
Kasim 
Reed, 
introduced 

Bloomberg: “Please welcome, the 
three-time mayor of the City of 
New York…,” which sounds exactly 
like the introduction athletes 
receive: 
getting 
the 
audience 

excited about the present moment, 
about the sporting event to come. 
This moment glorifies the future 
and ignores, for the moment, the 
past. For now, they are on your 
team; they are here to help.

Bloomberg 
then 
took 
the 

stage, with blaring saxophones 
accompanying him — almost the 
exact track celebrities receive as 
they come onstage to talk with 
David Letterman. Perhaps this 
is all that matters: his fame, his 
name recognition. The fact that 
he, that guy with that name, is 
endorsing our candidate… It must 
be terrific!

Bloomberg 
began 
his 

remarks by thanking Mr. Reed, 
mispronouncing his first name 
in the process. I should also note 
the irony that Reed is a Black man, 
introducing a figure who actively 
implemented a policing program 
that 
consistently 
violated 
the 

civil liberties of people of color. 
I posit this scheduling decision 
was designed to make us, on some 
level, look past Bloomberg’s past 
entirely. Not only is he at the 
students’ convention, but he’s 
being introduced by a Black man 
who’s talking about Bloomberg 
as a “mentor” and a “friend.” 
Why should we worry about all 
that stuff he used to do? He’s 
here now.

What we see here is Bloomberg 

as the work of art in the age of its 
mechanical reproducibility. The 
original object, with its tattered 
and destructive history, is long 
gone. The past has been effaced. 
The 
reproduced 
Bloomberg 

saunters 
onstage, 
triumphing 

the capture of his original. He 
can now begin anew.

These are the mechanics of 

mechanical reproduction. Right 
in front of our eyes, shameless, 
unembarrassed.

Now what?

T

he summer of 2016 will be one to 
remember: For the first time, a 
woman is the presidential candidate 

of a major political party; 
the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces 
of 
Colombia 

and 
the 
Colombian 

government 
signed 
a 

peace treaty ending a 
50-year war; but most 
importantly, 
“Pokemon 

Go” was released unto the 
world. 
An 
intrinsically 

social game, “Pokemon 
Go” sated my desire for 
human contact until I 
heard of PokeDates: a 
dating website for “Pokemon Go” players. I 
moseyed on down to the homepage and began 
the sign-up process until I noticed something 
peculiar. As part of finding your perfect 
match, the website asks for deal-breakers 
and the two first suggestions were “ultra 
conservative” and “a bleeding heart liberal.” 
It seems like not even Pokemon is spared 
from our nation’s hyper-politicization. Is 
nothing sacred anymore? 

These suggested “deal-breakers” don’t 

exist in a vacuum. They’re symptomatic of 
the way politics have infiltrated our lives. The 
polarization between our parties is as high as 
it was during the Civil War. This polarization 
has lent itself to a hyper-politicization that 
stretches from our day-to-day interactions 
to what would nominally be called politics, 
and has entered our previously relatively 
apolitical institutions such as the Supreme 
Court. For years, the Supreme Court had a 
protective layer. Judges serve life-long terms 
so they don’t have to worry about reelection 
and can rule how they feel is correct. There 
was also an understanding between the 
political parties that even if one doesn’t agree 
with a particular judicial nominee’s views, 
if they are sufficiently qualified, they should 
be sworn into the court. This is no longer the 
case.

Candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald 

Trump have helped reduce the court to an 
explicitly political institution by discussing 
our nation’s highest court in candid, political 
terms. Earlier this year, Sanders tweeted, 
“Any Supreme Court nominee of mine will 
make overturning Citizens United one of 

their first decisions.” This notion that a justice 
must have explicit priorities is unheard of in 
American politics. Similarly, Donald Trump 
released a list of whom he would nominate for 
the Supreme Court vacancy in a move widely 
seen as an attempt to win over evangelicals. 
I recall one debate during the Republican 
primary in which Trump explicitly called 
upon Mitch McConnell to “delay, delay, 
delay” Obama’s Supreme Court nomination. 
All of this discourse has turned the Supreme 
Court into just another pawn for politicians 
to play with, rather than an institution that 
carries itself aside from politics.

It’s important to recognize the Supreme 

Court has been politicized not only from 
the outside, but also from the inside. Earlier 
this year Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered a 
searing critique of Donald Trump: “I can’t 
imagine what this place would be — I can’t 
imagine what the country would be — with 
Donald Trump as our president.” At first, it 
was viscerally satisfying to hear one of our 
nation’s most accomplished women excoriate 
serial misogynist Donald Trump. However, 
upon further reflection I began to think that 
maybe this type of discourse wasn’t good 
for our democracy. It further politicizes 
the Supreme Court and diminishes trust 
in public institutions, which in turn 
destabilizes our democracy.

It would be easy to end this piece with a 

call for us to learn to accept one another’s 
different political views on a deeper level 
and not allow them to become key markers 
of our identity. I don’t think that’s 
remotely realistic. Frankly, I could never 
go on a PokeDate with someone who 
plans to vote for Trump this November. 
A Trump vote speaks volumes about a 
person’s underlying ethics in ways I’m not 
remotely comfortable with.

But what I can say is that we should each 

critically reflect on how deeply we have let 
politics penetrate our lives and whether 
we’re comfortable with that level. This bar 
will be different for everyone, but reflection 
is the first step to restoring some sanity to 
our democracy and rescuing our institutions 
from the grip of politics which may even — 
yes — make America great again.

Daily TV Columnist

In many ways, TV has an 

advantage over other forms of 
storytelling when it comes to real-
ism. There’s something artificial 
about fitting a neat, well-defined 
character arc into a 90-minute 
movie, even in the best of them. 
TV, though, allows storytellers to 
take their time and show gradual 
character development over the 
course of many hours.

But there are certain things 

that even TV can’t show, things so 
mundane or trivial that they just 
don’t make for good TV. There’s 
one glaring absence from TV in 
particular that sticks out to me, 
an abstract one: the constancy of 
emotion.

There was a week or so this 

past June when I felt like shit. It 
was a weird funk I was in, one 
that I can’t boil down to one spe-
cific thing. I was a bit jaded still 
about not having gotten a summer 
internship, and I wasn’t working 
as many hours as I wished I was, 
so I felt a little lonely and direc-
tionless, like I was waiting for the 
fall to start for my life to resume. 
Aside from that, I’d thrown up 
that week at a party and had 
a pretty debilitating hangover 
the next day or two. So for a few 
days, I felt bad physically and bad 
mentally, like time was moving so 
slowly and I was stagnating.

And it kind of occurred to me 

that that’s something movies, TV 
and even books rarely depict: sus-
tained sadness, anxiety or loneli-
ness. I guess showing the same 
character feeling the same emo-
tion for a long, drawn-out period 
of time naturally doesn’t make for 
good storytelling. It’s not enter-
taining, and after a while it just 
gets tedious and boring to watch 
the same character being sad, or 
angry, or whatever. It even makes 
them unlikable. If we see a char-
acter never smiling, we’re less 
inclined to like them, even if they 
have good reasons for it.

I think that TV ignores emo-

tional constancy for another big 
reason, though: it’s easy to ignore 
in real life, too. In life, it’s easy to 
completely gloss over these long 
periods of time. In real life, some-
body might say “For a few years 
I was really depressed,” and we 

comprehend what they mean, but 
we don’t truly get a sense for how 
constant and terrible that crush-
ing feeling of darkness must be. 
I’ve never experienced clinical 
depression, so that doesn’t quite 
apply to me, but I know that it’s 
something more constant and 
relentless than I can conceive of. 
It’s just hard for us to comprehend 
feeling the same steady darkness 
for interminable lengths of time.

In the past few years, TV has 

begun to tackle depression — 
often an inherently constant, 
unchanging experience — in new 
ways, finding a way to make it 
work narratively. “BoJack Horse-
man,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and 
“You’re the Worst” are all comedy 
series that have avoided becom-
ing stagnant by showing how 
their protagonists’ mental illness 
impacts their relationships with 
others, and how they make strides 
to reach out and get the help they 
need.

Yet few series depict the often 

mundane, boring reality of feel-
ing like shit, whether it’s rooted 
in biological or human causes. No 
mainstream, accessible TV show 
depicts long periods of sobbing in 
grief, or sitting and staring out a 
window for hours at a time, won-
dering where it all went wrong. 
Shows that do dwell on the same 
internal conflicts over and over 
tend to disappoint; the first half 
of this season of “Mr. Robot,” for 
example, has repeatedly shown 
Elliot (Rami Malek, “Short Term 
12”) struggling to accept the spec-
ter of his dead father (Christian 
Slater, “Heathers”) in his life. 
While it may be realistic to see 
him resisting so persistently, it 
makes for redundant viewing.

This doesn’t only apply to nega-

tive emotions, though. It can also 
apply to emotions like love. Think 
about all the great will-they-
won’t-they relationships on TV 
and how many characters were 
caught up in years of unrequited 
love, years desiring another per-
son and seeing them begin rela-
tionships with other people.

What about Jim (John Krasin-

ski) from “The Office?” Remem-
ber the night when Pam (Jenna 
Fischer) kissed Jim at Chili’s? 
From what I recall, the only reac-
tion we really see is a surprised 
smile from Jim. But can you 

imagine, realistically, how much 
Jim must’ve been freaking out 
about that? I bet he went home 
that night and just smiled in his 
bed for hours and barely got any 
sleep because he couldn’t stop 
running it over in his head, try-
ing to remember what exactly it 
felt like and trying to interpret 
what exactly it meant. It probably 
haunted him for weeks after!

And Jesus, how did Jim get 

through the entirety of Season 
3 still being in love with Pam? 
Maybe Karen (Rashida Jones) 
distracted him a little, but I’m 
sure he still had so many inter-
nal conflicts, so many moments 
where he thought about how 
Pam was honestly a lot better 
than Karen, moments where 
he lay next to Karen in bed and 
felt guilty. I understand why 
“The Office” didn’t depict these 
moments; among many reasons, 
it’s an ensemble show, and not a 
show that can dip directly into 
one character’s head to show us 
his internal demons. But realisti-
cally, within the context of the 
story, I bet a lot of them were 
there.

To be fair, I know that I’m 

more annoyingly self-reflective 
than a lot of people. But I think 
almost everyone must have some 
moments where their thoughts 
are entirely consumed by one 
thing, whether that’s romantic 
obsession, or anxiety about some 
upcoming event, or grief. Every-
one has moments when they can’t 
stop thinking about something, 
no matter how much they try 
to distract themselves. And the 
truth is, stories rarely depict that.

In the end, this may be an 

unsolvable 
problem. 
Narra-

tive, which is usually defined by 
change of some sort, may be dia-
metrically opposed to sustained 
depiction of any one emotion. To 
make being sad into an exciting, 
dynamic conflict, by showing one 
person grieving in a multitude of 
different ways, is to betray the 
reality of it. In reality, the truth 
is that being sad is usually bor-
ing and redundant. And nobody 
wants to watch boring TV.

What TV leaves out

Half-hearted 
biopic leans on 
impersonations

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

In 
our 
largely 
nostalgia-

fueled culture, supporters of 
President Barack Obama are 
feeling melan-
choly about his 
departure from 
office. 
Many, 

after 
seeing 

the sorry state 
of the current 
election cycle, 
have 
resorted 

to siding with 
neither 
Hill-

ary nor Trump, 
but rather Obama. Facebook and 
Twitter newsfeeds are inun-
dated with posts and clickbait 
articles about the way the people 
will miss him after January 2017. 
Obama himself seems more than 
aware of his increased popularity 
— he walked up to the podium at 
the last White House Correspon-
dents’ Dinner to Anna Kendrick’s 
“Cups (When I’m Gone).”

“Southside with You” is the 

latest product of this anticipatory 
nostalgia. The directorial debut 
of Richard Tanne, the film fol-
lows Barack Obama (Parker Saw-
yers, “Zero Dark Thirty”) and 
Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpt-

er, “Get On Up”) on a semi-fic-
tionalized account of their first 
date. Michelle is his advisor at 
the Chicago law firm where he’s 
working as a summer associate. 
She thinks it’s inappropriate for 
them to be romantic, but he’s 
trying to convince her to pri-
oritize their feelings over office 
politics. During one of Sumpt-
er’s most compelling scenes, 
she explains that she first has to 
prove herself as a woman, and 
then must start again to prove 
herself as a Black woman.

Despite her reservations, they 

spend the entire day together, 
walking around art museums 
and going to a community cen-
ter to see Barack in action, end-
ing the night with a viewing 
of Spike Lee’s “Do the Right 
Thing.” Unlike the film that it’s 
often been compared to (“Before 
Sunrise”), the pacing of the film 
drags, forcing us to comfort 
ourselves with the fact that we 
know the very happy ending. 
“Southside With You” has less 
of an actual plot and more of 
the makings of a political com-
mercial. In all fairness, the aim-
less wandering does feel slightly 
reminiscent of “Before Sunrise,” 
if the audience had walked into 
the Linklater film with eight 
years of preconceived notions 
about the plot and main charac-
ters. 

The acting of the film is not 

so much acting as it is imper-

sonation. Sawyers captures the 
essence of the President, down 
to his self-assured stutters and 
compulsive smoking to calm 
himself down. But while his 
stylistic acting remains more 
subtle, with only a few pure 
Obama-isms, Sumpter’s impres-
sion of Michelle Obama’s speech 
patterns is jarring and extreme. 
If you close your eyes, it’s like

to forget that they are characters

that this is a movie. Tanne is 
overly cautious, not pushing into 
unknown territory or exploring 
new emotional ground. He stays 
safely at a kind and almost boring 
portrayal of two people falling 
in love. It’s too comfortable, shot 
on location with beautiful shots 
of Chicago overlaid with dreamy 
music. The film is so soothing 
that it lends itself to being good 
white noise if you happen to 
drift off in the theater. There’s 
also the contentment that comes 
with knowing how everything is 
going to work out — they may be 
driving broken down cars and 
living with their parents now, 
but we know this story ends in 
the White House.

‘Things’ laughs at 
parental mundanity

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

We open on a young girl cry-

ing. She tugs at the arm of her 
mother, 
whose 
indifference 

clearly perturbs 
the 
woman 

sitting on the 
bench next to 
them. The wail-
ing goes on, its 
grating 
sound 

irritating, 
yet 

compelling. In 
these few short 
moments, “Bet-
ter 
Things” 

wordlessly 
establishes the 
unique narrative language it 
uses to tell the story of Sam Fox 
(show co-creator Pamela Adlon, 
“Louie”), a single mother of three 
trudging through the frustra-
tions of everyday life.

Sam turns to the disapprov-

ing woman and bluntly asks, 
“Do you want to buy her the 
earrings?” revealing the reason 
for her daughter’s incessant cry-
ing. In the simplest and tersest 
way possible, Sam asserts her 
confidence in her parenting — a 
quality that defines her charac-
ter and foregrounds the premise 
of the series. This teaser speaks 
volumes about the kind of char-
acter we can expect Sam to be 
and the kind of series we can 
look forward to, without actually 
expressing much verbally. 

Though a half-hour comedy, 

FX’s new series, co-created by 
Adlon and Louis C.K. (“Louie”), 
dips its toe into drama territory 

— delivering its honest comedy 
(a particular brand of C.K.’s and 
Adlon’s) with the same nuance 
that presents itself in real-life, 
everyday challenges. This cross-
ing of genres feels both natural 
and instinctively relatable — 
requiring minimal exposition 
in the delivery of both narrative 
content and comedy.

The scene following the epi-

sode’s 
teaser 
illustrates 
the 

succinct and often speechless 
manner in which information is 
delivered to us. In the shopping 
mall bathroom with her previ-
ously crying daughter, Duke 
(Olivia Edward, “Unbreakable 
Kimmy Schmidt”), Sam receives 
a phone call from a man whose 
identity is revealed to us only 
through her exasperated moan 
and a hesitant “Hi, Richard,” then 
a cut to shot of him sitting in his 
office. A series of awkward vocal-
ized pauses ensues before Sam 
curtly says “I’ll see you in school 
things,” putting an end to the 
painful conversation. The cam-
era cuts back to a tightly framed 
two shot of Sam and Duke, evok-
ing their close relationship. Sam’s 
honesty when Duke asks who 
was on the other end of the line 
and Duke’s knowing “Ew, eww!” 
in response echoes this closeness. 
With little spoken, this sequence 
conveys a network of meanings 
that provide a window into both 
the plot and theme of the episode 
as it gradually unfolds.

Adlon skillfully delivers a sub-

tle range of emotions that convey 
the complexity of Sam’s relation-
ships with her daughters, her 
struggles as a single mother and 

her vulnerability within her per-
sonal and love life. The artful pre-
cision with which the episode is 
cut and the often vague dialogue 
gives us just enough informa-
tion to satisfyingly arrive at our 
own conclusions about the plot. 
And while dramatic in tone, the 
witty dialogue and physical com-
edy tactfully provide moments of 
relief when the burden of Sam’s 
exasperation become too much 
to bear.

A scene in which Sam shops 

for school supplies with her 
daughter Max (Mikey Madi-
son, “Bound for Greatness”) is 
characterized by Sam’s irrita-
tion with being unable to find 
graph paper while Max, the ste-
reotypical teenager, dejectedly 
plods ahead through the aisle. At 
one point, unable to contain her 
frustration, Sam yells out into 
the store “Does anybody work 
here?”, an extended gesture of 
her own isolation. Just when her 
frustration reaches a climactic 
point, she receives a comically 
unexpected response from a 
store employee over the loud-
speaker, and her anger dissipates. 
It’s a moment that feels hilarious-
ly relatable, reflecting the trivial 
annoyances that culminate in a 
catharsis of anger and frustra-
tion before subsiding.

“Better Things” is emotional 

without being mawkish, hilari-
ously self-deprecating without 
being slapstick and likely to be 
one of the best new shows this 
fall. Adlon demonstrates her 
skill as the much deserved lead 
of the show with an undoubtedly 
thrilling evolution to come.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

If there’s anyone currently in 

pop culture with an idiosyncratic 
personality and perspective on 
life, it’s arguably 
Donald Glover. 
The 32-year-old 
wunderkind 
actor/rapper 
first 
rose 
to 

prominence on 
YouTube, 
and 

then as a young 
writer for NBC’s 
“30 
Rock” 

before scoring a 
role on the cult 
hit “Community.” But around 
2011, Glover began an unex-
pected route into the world of 
hip-hop, releasing a multitude of 
EPs and mixtapes under the Wu-
Tang generated moniker Childish 
Gambino. Though most critics 
didn’t initially take him seriously, 
Glover developed a loyal fanbase 
and thus continued to perform as 
Childish. He toured, released his 
second studio album Because the 
Internet in 2013 and his EP Kauai 
in 2014.

As he eventually cut ties with 

“Community” and his stand-up 
background, 
Glover 
gradually 

went from being known as the 
goofy Troy on “Community” to a 
serious, hard-working and occa-
sionally self-deprecating artist. 
Glover puts his knowledge of 
hip hop and comedy to good use, 
intersecting them beautifully and 
almost seamlessly as the writer, 
producer and star of the FX sit-
com “Atlanta.”

Blessed with an incredible 

cast, breathtaking visuals and 
authentic writing, the refreshing 
“Atlanta” achieves a rare balance 
between witty, deadpan humor 
and pathos that most comedies 
about success and the American 
Dream struggle to attain. Next to 
“Master of None,” “Atlanta” is the 

Goldilocks of socially conscious 
comedy: thought-provoking with-
out being didactic, eccentric but 
not alienating and intelligent with-
out trying to be high-brow.

Among the few exciting TV pro-

grams showcasing more diverse 
storytelling — “Master of None,” 
“The Get Down,” “The Carmi-
chael Show” and the upcoming 
“Insecure” — “Atlanta” is a huge 
standout, presenting the modern 
day Black experience with both 
hilarious and sobering results.

Glover leads as straight-man 

Earnest “Earn” Marks, a Princeton 
dropout struggling with a dead-
end job at the airport and a compli-
cated home situation with Vanessa 
(newcomer Zazie Beetz), his best 
friend and the mother of his infant 
daughter. But once he discovers 
his cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree 
Henry, “Boardwalk Empire”) is 
an up-and-coming rapper named 
Paper Boi, Earn sees an oppor-
tunity to manage him and make 
something out of his own life.

Plot-wise, “Atlanta” can seem 

like another conventional com-
ing-of-age story, and in a sense, 
it is deceptively simple. How-
ever, with Glover’s deft sensibili-
ties and keen observational eye, 
“Atlanta” spins the formula in a 
thoughtful and entertaining way, 
making us laugh in one scene and 
pensively reflect during another.

Directed by music video film-

maker Hiro Murai, “Atlanta” ’s 
first two episodes make the most 
out of developing the characters 
and story, even showing the city 
itself as a character. Murai adopts 
a visual style as unconventional 
and intriguing as “Mr. Robot” ’s, 
utilizing the city’s spacious exte-
rior with beautiful aerial shots 
and gorgeous wide shots and the 
interiors of city complexes with 
soft focus and intimate framing.

While the pilot, “The Big 

Bang,” spends most of its half-
hour setting up the story, as any 
first episode would, it quickly 

establishes each main character’s 
voice and personality, illustrated 
by the dynamic of Earn, Paper 
Boi and his soft-spoken assistant 
Darius (an excellent Keith Stan-
field, “Straight Outta Compton”). 
At first, Paper Boi is reluctant to 
bring Earn aboard his burgeon-
ing rap enterprise, believing that 
he’s only trying to manage him 
for the money. Both Earn’s per-
sistence and Paper Boi’s hesitance 
seem genuine, thanks to their 
witty banter and both Glover and 
Henry’s acting chops. However, 
once Earn gets Paper Boi’s song on 
the radio, they join forces. Things 
seem to turn for the better until 
a hostile encounter with a hater 
leads both Earn and Paper Boi to 
jail.

In the second episode, “Streets 

on Lock,” Earn and Paper Boi 
each experience the aftermath 
of that encounter to an equally 
gut-busting and terrifying effect. 
Uncomfortable with the early 
trappings of fame, Paper Boi 
attempts to divert his fans, but 
can’t seem to escape his notoriety. 
Simultaneously, while Earn waits 
in processing, he witnesses the 
mistreatment of the mentally ill, 
police brutality and transphobia 
in three blistering sequences. His 
awkwardness in these situations 
provide some much-needed levi-
ty, but these scenes will neverthe-
less render you speechless.

The beauty of “Atlanta” is that 

it never once feels like it’s try-
ing so hard to showcase why its 
observations on societal issues 
are important; it just does. The 
camera simply captures Earn, 
Paper Boi and Darius journey-
ing through mundane everyday 
situations in the trenches of the 
Georgian capital. To sum it up: 
“Atlanta” is definitely one of the 
best (if not the best) shows of the 
fall season and truly captures the 
peak of Donald Glover’s career as 
an artist and voice of our genera-
tion.

ALBUM REVIEW
Grouplove plays it 
safe on new Big Mess

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

“We’re back in business / 

you’re such a big mess / and I 
love you,” is how Grouplove’s 
new album, Big 
Mess, 
begins, 

and it’s these 
three lines that 
largely 
sum 

up the rest of 
the 
album: 

a 
very 
big, 

aimless 
mess 

that, 
though 

unrestricted 
in 
its 
guitar 

strums 
and 
happy-go-lucky 

vocals, you can’t help but love. 

Despite the overall chaos of 

Big Mess, the album starts off 
relatively organized. “Welcome 
to Your Life” is a flashy 
attention-grabber of an intro 
song, very reminiscent of 2011-
era Grouplove. Its hippie, feel-
good sound directly mimics 
old iconic Grouplove favorites 
like “Tongue Tied” and “Lovely 
Cup.” “Welcome to Your Life” is 
the perfect first song because it 
skillfully captures Grouplove’s 
entire appeal as a band: the 
promise that, no matter where 
you are (even if it’s dreary 
Michigan in mid-November), 
within the first few notes, 
you’re instantly transported to 
somewhere stress-free, with 
warm sand underneath your 
toes and the sun illuminating 
all the beauty this world has 
to offer. With this first track, 
Grouplove grabs your hand and 
says “welcome to our album; it 
can also be your life.”

Attention 
successfully 

captured, 
Grouplove 
wastes 

no time showcasing their best 
qualities through the songs 
“Do You Love Someone” and 

“Standing in The Sun.” Both 
of these tracks are mellower 
than 
“Welcome 
To 
Your 

Life,” yet both contain the 
same 
uninhibited 
quality. 

In every moment of these 
songs, Grouplove is holding 
nothing back; the background 
instruments 
clash 
together 

to produce a cacophony of 
sound that fits so perfectly 
with the simple, yet genuine 
vocals. 
Grouplove 
isn’t 

afraid to be cluttered, and 
in their imperfection comes 
authenticity. “Do You Love 
Someone” and “Standing in The 
Sun” are personable, optimistic 
and entirely pure in their 
pandemonium. 

Many of the songs in Big 

Mess, like “Good Morning” and 
“Cannonball,” hold these same 
qualities. In fact, looking at the 
individual songs in the album 
separately, Grouplove continues 
to put 110%, no holds barred, 
into each and every note. 

However, 
a 
problem 

materializes when viewing the 
album as a whole. Despite the 
vivacity of distinctive songs, 
there’s hardly any distinction in 
sound from one song to the next. 
Big Mess, overall, flatlines. 
While none of the songs are 
horrendous, they do all seem 
to blur into one giant clamor of 
California beach vibes and free 
spirit alt rock when listened 

to as a whole. For example, 
“Spinning,” when heard on its 
own, is a light song that’s easy 
and fun to listen to. The line, 
“Me, I can never stop my world 
from spinning” layers perfectly 
over the simple, optimistic 
jangle 
of 
the 
background 

music. However, when heard in 
succession with the extremely 
similar “Good Morning” and 
“Cannonball,” the song loses its 
charm and transforms into an 
indistinct mass. The songs in 
Big Mess are too homogenous, 
and thus the album loses the 
noteworthy characteristics that 
are apparent in its individual 
songs. 

“Enlighten 
Me” 
and 

“Traumatized” are the only two 
songs that show any variation 
from the rest of the album. 
“Enlighten Me” is darker and 
more melodramatic than any 
typical, upbeat Grouplove song, 
while “Traumatized” seems to 
draw influences from bands 
like Cage the Elephant and 
Pixies with its angry electric 
background and half-screaming 
vocals. These two songs are 
islands in the sea of monotony 
that is Big Mess and show where 
this album could’ve gone if 
Grouplove had experimented 
with their sound just a little 
more. 

Big Mess is a solid album 

with notable individual songs, 
but it’s very safe. Grouplove 
isn’t 
making 
any 
leaps 
or 

experiments, nor do they seem 
to want to. To take a stab at 
relevancy, whatever Grouplove 
produces next needs to take 
their sound up to the next 
level. But for now, unassuming, 
easygoing uniformity is the 
only thing to expect from Big 
Mess.

and 
a 
strong 

national defense. Stanchina 
said his group’s objectives 
highlight the importance of 
commemorating 9/11.

“The ideas that we like to 

bring to campus, the speakers 
and the topics we like to 
embrace 
and 
have 
spoken 

about, those are the reasons 
that the attack occurred,” he 

said. “We feel a special duty to 
commemorate.”

Captain 
Chris 
Dennis, 

professor of Naval Science 
and Commanding Officer of 
the Navy Officer Education 
Program, said the events from 
9/11 affected not only the 
United States but also the rest 
of the world, and the act of 
remembering and reflecting 
upon it should unite people 
across the globe.

“Everybody’s heart broke 

and there was an outpouring of 
love and support for the United 
States, and I think really for 

humanity,” he said. “That for 
me is what is special about 9/11. 
That spirit of togetherness 
and 
suffering 
together 

and 
reclaiming 
humanity 

together.”

Dennis 
also 
said 
the 

simplicity 
of 
Sunday’s 

commemoration is the most 
powerful agent for getting 
people to reflect on the tragedy.

“It’s fairly understated,” he 

said. “I hope people stop and 
remember the vulnerability of 
life and redouble their efforts 
to work together with one

In post-9/11 and a post-

Brussels 
Europe, 
this 
is 
a 

scenario has played out over and 
over — families contacting loved 
ones abroad or wondering, “What 
if it was my son or daughter?” at 
home. Amid mounting terrorist 
attacks in Germany, France, 
Britain, Turkey, Belgium, Russia 
and Spain, reports warning 
foreign students to avoid places 
like shopping malls, schools, 
airports and other forms of 
public 
transportation 
are 

increasingly common.

On 
May 
31, 
the 
U.S. 

Department 
of 
State 
issued 

a warning specifically about 
traveling in Europe between 
that 
date 
and 
August 
3, 

telling 
travelers 
to 
be 
on 

alert 
for 
potential 
terrorist 

attacks 
targeting 
major 

events, commercial areas and 
transportation.

“The large number of tourists 

visiting Europe in the summer 
months will present greater 
targets for terrorists planning 
attacks 
in 
public 
locations, 

especially at large events,” the 
alert read.

The 
Department 
of 
State 

wasn’t wrong. Three weeks 
before the stabbing in London, 
a truck was driven into crowds 
celebrating Bastille Day, killing 
at least 84 people and leaving 18 
others wounded in the French 
Riviera city of Nice.

Amid 
this 
atmosphere, 

the 
Center 
for 
Global 
and 

Intercultural Study, the office 
that coordinates most study 
abroad 
programs 
for 
LSA 

students, sent about 650 to 700 
University of Michigan students 
abroad this summer.

LSA 
junior 
Margaret 

O’Connor 
was 
among 
13 

University 
students 
studying 

abroad in Germany through 
the Center of Intercultural and 
Global Studies at the time. She 
wrote in an email interview that 
she was eager to experience the 
culture first-hand and exercise 
her language skills in a way that 
would be impossible to do in the 
United States.

“Because both of my sisters 

attended (the University) and 
studied abroad, I’ve envisioned 
myself doing the same for a few 
years,” O’Connor wrote. “I’ve 
studied German for several 
years in high school and later 
took intensive German in the 
(Residential College), so going 
there made a lot of sense for me.”

O’Connor was traveling across 

Berlin on the underground with 
two of her friends on the night of 
a popular soccer game. The train 
was fairly crowded and rowdy, 
with many passengers from the 
game.

While 
waiting 
for 
their 

connecting train, O’Connor and 
her friends heard three small 
explosions that sounded like 
they were coming from the train 
car. People began to scream, 
and 
O’Connor 
immediately 

believed she was in the center of 
a terrorist attack.

“It took about a minute for us 

to realize it was only fireworks 
some excited sports fan had lit 
off, but the feeling of pure terror 

we 
experienced 
was 
really 

rattling,” O’Connor wrote. “It 
made me really sad and angry 
that we live in a world where 
attacks like this are almost 
expected, and could happen 
anywhere to anyone.”

When 
recollecting 
the 

experience, 
O’Connor 
wrote 

that she wondered whether they 
reacted the way they did because 
they were abroad, and news of 
the dangers abroad has been 
anything but understated. She 
noted, however, that she did not 
believe her family and friends 
would have deterred her from 
going abroad and that for her, 
there was no perceived threat 
regarding her visit to Germany.

“Shortly after we came home, 

however, Munich was struck 
by more gun violence, and I felt 
weirdly connected to it because 
it happened right in the middle 
of the city not far from where 
we spent most of our time,” 
O’Connor wrote.

For 
O’Connor, 
potentially 

dangerous 
situations 
alone 

wouldn’t 
deter 
her 
from 

an 
enriching 
educational 

experience, 
but 
she 
added 

that it would certainly be a 
consideration if she were to go 
on a future trip.

Speaking 
to 
programs 
in 

France in particular, Rachel 
Reuter, the health and safety 
adviser for CGIS, said despite 
mounting 
terrorist 
reports 

from the country, the number 
of students applying to study 
abroad has steadily increased 
over the past several years. CGIS 
reported the numbers of their 
Winter application cycle showed 
23 applications in 2014, 33 in 
2015, and so far this year more 
than 62 students have applied to 
study in France.

LSA senior Mallory Jamett 

said she chose the Arts in Paris 
program because it was the 
best opportunity that worked 
within her art history major. 
Her parents were nervous about 
her decision, but Jamett believes 
they would have been hesitant 
regardless of where she chose to 
study.

“The Paris attacks were fresh 

on everyone’s mind, but since U 
of M hadn’t canceled any other 
study abroad programs to that 
area, my parents didn’t see any 
large cause for alarm,” Jamett 
said.

Jamett 
was 
watching 

fireworks on the lawn by the 
Eiffel Tower during the Bastille 
Day terrorist attack in Nice. 
Upon returning to the home 
of the French family she was 
living with, Jamett checked 
her phone for the first time 
that night. It was flooded with 
concerned 
messages 
asking 

where she was, asking if she 
was OK. After checking Twitter, 
Jamett learned that a truck had 
intentionally driven into the 
celebrating crowd.

Jamett said this attack came 

as a nasty shock to French 
citizens 
and 
study 
abroad 

members alike, but she wasn’t 
that surprised.

“The strange thing was, I 

didn’t find it terribly shocking, 
and I think it was because I had 
been desensitized to violent 
attacks from the U.S. With so 
many mass shootings and violent 
crimes, as a culture, America 
sees this violence much more 
often than France,” Jamett said. 

“I recognize that this tragedy 
caused lots of people fear and 
grief, but at the same time, I 
could only recognize the effect 
of it. I felt very little of these 
emotions myself.”

CGIS Director Mike Jordan 

said the swell in applications, 
despite the changed atmosphere, 
speaks to the strength of the 
programs and the mindsets 
of the students seeking those 
opportunities.

“If you look at something 

like what happened in Brussels, 
three 
students 
backed 
out 

but one was unrelated to the 
attacks, so two students out of 21 
withdrew,” Jordan said.

In 
Jamett’s 
22-person 

program, 
participants 
were 

University 
students 
from 
a 

variety of majors.

“I consider the U.S. to be 

dangerous; the entire world is 
filled with risks. It’s a matter of if 
that area is an active war zone,” 
Jamett said. “If the area that I 
want to study in is particularly 
violent, then I would definitely 
reconsider studying there, but 
to rule out an area purely due to 
fear would be shortsighted.”

Jordan, the junior studying 

at Oxford, expressed a similar 
sentiment, citing the color-coded 
terrorism threat advisory scale 
— an alert system for travelers 
post- 9/11 through Homeland 
Security. The different levels, 
beginning with green, which 
signifies a low threat, and 
ending with red, indicating a 
severe threat, trigger specific 
actions by federal agencies and 
state and local governments, and 
impact the security measures at 
some airports and other public 
facilities.

“It seems like for a year or 

more the risk color was orange,” 
Jordan recalled. “You cannot 
just live in constant fear.”

When a real emergency hits, 

Reuter said CGIS has various 
measures in place to reach 
out to students and reassure 
families. 
The 
department 

has 10 emergency responders 
available to attend to the 24/7 
emergency phone line. It also 
requires students, staff and 
faculty abroad to put location 
and contact data into their 
international 
travel 
registry. 

When circumstances become 
dangerous in a particular region, 
Reuter and her team hop online.

“I start contacting them via 

email, cell phone, Facebook, 
WhatsApp, however we can get 
a response,” Reuter said.

Due to the large numbers of 

students within LSA, Reuter 
said it is the only college with a 
position like hers. Through the 
Office of the Provost, another 
senior 
international 
health 

adviser is in place.

“We have partners on the 

ground throughout the world 
that provide logistical support 
for our programs,” Jordan said. 
“They have policies where once 
the students have all checked in 
with them, they’ll notify us. And 
I think that alleviates a lot of 
parents’ fears.”

Reuter 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of registering side 
trips — any supplementary travel 
during a study abroad — through 
MCompass.

“I don’t care if you’re on a side 

trip in Amsterdam or drunk on 
a beach in Mexico, my goal is to 
make sure you’re safe,” she said.

remember the lives lost during 
the attacks. He said he thought 
it was important to continue to 
recognize the impact 9/11 had.

“The freshmen coming to the 

University of Michigan weren’t 
even in kindergarten when 9/11 
happened, so it’s important 
that we remember and remind 
students how vulnerable our 
country was on that day and the 
fact that our way of life is still at 
risk,” Strobl said.

Vulnerability 
was 
another 

common facet of public opinion 
after 9/11 — the ISR survey also 
found that many Americans 
suffered a loss of personal safety 
and security. The survey report 
stated that about half of its 
respondents said their personal 
sense of safety and security was 
reduced “a great deal” or “a good 
amount.”

Frost 
recalled 
having 
to 

complete extensive safety drills 
in her New York school following 
the attacks, such as practicing 
getting underneath the desk or 
rushing to the school gym.

Arab and Muslim Americans 

have also been at a higher risk 
of hate crimes since the attacks, 
according to the FBI Hate 
Crimes Statistics reports, which 
note anti-Islamic hate crimes 
have increased from less than 2 
percent in 2000 to more than 16 
percent in 2014.

Evelyn 
Alsultany, 
director 

of Arab and Muslim American 
Studies, 
who 
teaches 
the 

course “Why Do They Hate Us: 
Perspectives on 9/11,” wrote in 
an email interview that political 
responses to the attacks — such 
as U.S. involvement in the Iraq 
War — led to an increase in 
anti-Arab 
and 
anti-Muslim 

sentiments 
following 
the 

attacks, which continue to exist 
to this day.

“Saying that the cause of 

terror is Islam is simplistic and 
inaccurate,” Alsultany wrote. 
“That is not to say that Islam has 
nothing to do with it when these 
are self proclaimed Muslims in 
the case of ISIS and al-Qaeda, 
but that it is not the origin or 
cause of terrorism. If it were, 
then 1.6 billion Muslims could 
be involved in terrorism, instead 
of a small fraction.”

In the past year, Muslim- 

and Arab-American students 
at the University have gathered 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
speak-

out 
regarding 
Islamophobic 

remarks, and feeling targeted 

on campus. One recent example 
includes chalkings on the Diag 
last 
March 
stating 
remarks 

such as “Stop Islam,” prompting 
a statement from University 
President Mark Schlissel calling 
for a campus-wide need to 
respect all students.

“What Islamophobia reveals 

is an inability to understand 
that the 1.6 billion Muslims 
of the world are people like 
any other people — consisting 
of a range of experiences and 
characteristics,” 
Alsultany 

wrote.

History Lecturer Jonathan 

Marwil said.the attacks have 
a wide array of consequences, 
from health impacts for those 
who could have breathed in the 
debris or dust from the site, to 
changes in political and military 
relationships 
with 
different 

nations, to broader cultural 
implications in American music 
and literature.

“The 
consequences 

internationally have so far been 
huge, 
considerable,” 
Marwil 

said. “And there’s no evidence to 
suggest that those consequences 
are going to diminish in the 
foreseeable future.”

Despite having experienced 

the attacks firsthand, Frost said 
said she finds herself forgetting 
more 
and 
more 
of 
what 

happened on Sept. 11 as the years 
go by, though she hopes for more 
remembrance events to keep the 
significance prominent.

“Our national security was 

completely robbed from us, and 
I think that affects all citizens 
still,” Frost said.

SEPTEMBER

me when I entered adulthood, 

to experience this tragedy,” 
she said. “From the top of the 
carillon tower at Yale, you could 
see the smoke from the Twin 
Towers. I think it deserves 
commemorating and living on in 
our memories every year.”

Collins said he appreciated 

the 
overall 
effect 
of 
the 

memorial, and was surprised by 
the number of people who came 
to listen.

“I 
was 
really 
impressed 

with 
the 
overall 
program, 

standing down in the plaza and 
listening to that,” he said. “I was 
impressed with the number of 
folks that showed up. They came 
and went, but there were a fair 
number of folks who just stayed 
out there on the plaza. I think 
that showed a lot of respect. I’m 
thankful for Tiffany and the 

University doing that.”

Ng also said part of the event’s 

success was owed to the quality 
of the instrument, adding that 
she hopes to continue this 
memorial on Sept. 11 in years to 
come.

“These English bells, cast in 

1935 in Loughborough, England 
have a very deep, resonant and 
mournful sound that’s perfect 
for 
memorial 
repertoire, 
I 

think,” she said. “It works just 
so well here.”

get to perform during our 

semesterly concerts in Hill 
Auditorium,” he said. “We 
really enjoy them, they’re all 
beautiful, moving pieces and 
very personal, obviously, for us 
as a group at the University of 
Michigan.”

Kiessling said he is hoping 

for lyrics that highlight the 
best parts of the University.

“We are looking for lyrics 

that 
help 
celebrate 
the 

University, the fact that it has 
remained such an incredible 
location 
and 
avenue 
of 

opportunity for so many for 
the past 200 years,” he said.

He said another important 

requirement for the lyrics is 
the inclusion of the three main 
ideals of the Glee Club, which 
are tradition, camaraderie and 
musical excellence. However, 
he added that beyond these 
requirements, there’s a large 
range of possibilities for the 

song.

“These 
lyrics 
are 
fairly 

open-ended as well, so we look 
forward to seeing all of the 
different 
submissions 
we’ll 

receive, and all the creativity 
that the University of Michigan 
tends to foster,” Kiessling said.

Kuster 
echoed 
his 

sentiments.

“Because our lyrics will 

come 
from 
U-M-affiliated 

writers, we also expect we’ll 
be 
moved 
by 
something 

beautifully 
and 
brilliantly 

unexpected,” she said.

...Too Easy

Nation’s top 2016 
recruit steps in at 

defensive end, earns 

first career sack

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Chris Wormley had not yet 

started his answer about Rashan 
Gary when Gary appeared in 
the doorway to Wormley’s left. 
The two defensive ends had just 
helped the Michigan football 
team rout Central Florida, 51-14, 
and Wormley, a fifth-year senior 
captain, was asked about one of 
his top mentees.

Almost on cue, Gary had 

just walked in on Wormley and 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 

Wilton Speight’s postgame press 
conference to join them.

“I mean, look at him over there,” 

Wormley said. “He’s a freshman. 
He’s, what, 18 years old? Six-(foot)-
five, (287 lbs.). Unbelievable pass 
rusher. Quick off the ball. Learns 
the defense really well. He’s a fast 
learner. You put all those together 
as a freshman, it’s something 
special. He’s a good kid. He plays 
hard, he plays fast and he just 
wants to win.”

Then, Gary walked up to the 

podium to sit beside Speight and 
Wormley, forcing two of the most 
important players on the team to 
scoot over.

“Oh, boy,” Speight said. “Lot of 

meat.”

There was plenty of room for 

Gary in the camera shot Saturday, 
and the true freshman proved 
there will be plenty of room for 

him on Michigan’s defensive line 
this year. If Gary inched onto the 
stage last week against Hawaii, 
making three tackles in a low-key 
blowout win, then Saturday may 
have been his breakout game.

Playing 

increased 
snaps, Gary tied 
for second on 
the team with 
six tackles, led 
the Wolverines 
with 
2.5 

tackles 
for 

loss and added 
an assist on a 
sack, 
ending 

a 
bothersome 

drought of … one week.

“I was itching for a sack this 

week, because I didn’t get one 
last week and I felt like I owed 
the D-line,” Gary said. “Because I 

missed one (against) Hawaii, and 
I’m like, ‘I’m not going to miss any 
opportunity I get from now on.’ ”

The sack came early in the 

second 
quarter, 
when 
Gary 

and redshirt junior linebacker 

Ben 
Gedeon 

teamed up to 
smother 
UCF 

quarterback 
Justin Holman 
at 
his 
own 

two-yard line. 
The 
Knights 

punted 
three 

plays later, and 
Michigan made 
it 31-0 three 
plays after that.

Gary’s 
chance 
came 
as 
a 

consequence 
of 
early-season 

injuries. Senior defensive end Taco 
Charlton and redshirt sophomore 
tackle Bryan Mone both missed 

Saturday’s game with injuries. 
Gary didn’t start — redshirt 
sophomore Chase Winovich did 
instead — but he played most of 
the snaps, as Michigan needed 
him to.

No other defensive end saw 

significant action, and Central 
Florida, in its first year running a 
new up-tempo offense, ran one play 
every 22.6 seconds of game time.

Gary 
said 
he 
felt 
more 

comfortable than last weekend 
— in part thanks to the help of 
Wormley and Charlton, one of 
whom anchored the line, the other 
of whom Gary helped replace. 
The Wolverines swap defensive 
linemen constantly during games, 
and Gary is leaving enough of an 
impression with the coaches to 
keep his name in that rotation.

For head coach Jim Harbaugh, 

a man who shows an almost 

religious devotion to the tenacity 
required of football players, few 
compliments mean more than 
calling a player tough. Saturday, 
when asked about Gary, that was 
one of the first words out of the 
coach’s mouth.

At one point during the first 

week 
of 
practice, 
Harbaugh 

recalled, 
Gary 
dislocated 
his 

finger and went in for an X-ray. 
“The trainer was like, ‘Man, what 
is that?’ or something to that 
effect,” Harbaugh said.

“That’s football,” he recalled 

Gary saying, and Gary returned to 
the field.

Another time, Gary cramped 

up during practice, so Harbaugh 
took him out, only to find the 
youngster back on the field a half-
dozen plays later.

“He’s really good like that,”

Michigan takes 
care of business, 
beats UCF 51-14 to 
win second straight

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

It was a resounding win, a 

37-point drubbing that covered 
the spread and left no doubt as to 
who was the better team.

It just wasn’t as flawless as the 

week before.

Coming off a 63-3 blowout of 

Hawaii in its season opener, the 
No. 5 Michigan football team 
(2-0) was never in any danger 
against Central Florida (1-1) on 
Saturday. The Wolverines won 
51-14, and after Michigan jumped 
out to a 31-0 lead, the Knights 
never came within 24.

But it was hardly perfect. UCF 

racked up 275 rushing yards, 
capitalizing on a handful of long 
runs to show the Michigan run 
defense it was not impenetrable. 
Knights running back Adrian 

Killins had only one rush in the 
game, but he took it 87 yards to 
the end zone. Quarterback Justin 
Holman broke off a pair of long 
runs before leaving the game 
with an apparent injury before 
halftime, and his backup, Nick 
Patti, held his own too.

Perhaps Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh said it best, talking 
about his team’s offensive and 
defensive lines.

“I wouldn’t call it dominating,” 

he said. “Took care of business.”

The offensive line gave up eight 

tackles for loss, and the running 
game struggled to find a rhythm, 
finishing with 119 yards. But, as 
Harbaugh pointed out, that was 
largely due to UCF’s apparent 
emphasis on stopping the run. And 
that opened up the passing game.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight was 
strong again, completing 25 of 
37 passes for 312 yards and four 
touchdowns, two of which went 
to senior tight end Jake Butt. 
Butt’s second score gave him 
three for the season, matching his 
total from all of last season, to go 
with his 86 yards on the day.

Fifth-year senior wide receiver 

Amara Darboh was on the 
receiving end of Speight’s other 
two touchdowns. Redshirt junior 
fullback Khalid Hill tacked on 
a pair of scores on the ground, 
giving the converted tight end a 
team-high three for the season.

Asked what he would have 

thought about that fact a couple 
years ago, Hill said he wouldn’t 
believe it.

“This is a great feeling,” he said. 

“It’s a great accomplishment, but 
I just want to keep getting better 
and scoring more touchdowns.”

Hill also caught a pass, one of 

10 different Wolverines to do so 
Saturday. Butt led the team with 
seven catches, and Darboh broke 
the 100-yard mark with 111.

Darboh made his first catch 

on a 45-yard ball from Speight, 
part of a more prominent deep-
passing game Saturday, to go up 
21-0 in the first quarter. His other 
touchdown came on a fourth-
quarter crossing route, which he 
took 30 yards to the end zone to 
cap the scoring.

But for as solid as Speight looked

The perks of being Jim Harbaugh’s quarterback
J

im Harbaugh won his 70th 
game out of 100 as a college 
head football coach on 

Saturday, but he was once 1-3. 
And the loss 
that put him 
at 1-3 came 
on Sept. 25, 
2004, when 
his San Diego 
team lost to 
Princeton, 
24-17.

One of 

the crushing 
blows in that 
game was a 
Todd Mortensen interception 
with 3:45 to play. Mortensen, a 
senior transfer from Brigham 
Young, went to the sideline, 
and Harbaugh’s reaction — like 
everything else about Michigan’s 
second-year head coach — was 
familiar.

“I could tell he was 

disappointed, because he’s 
competitive, and he wants to win 
as much or more than anyone. 
But I didn’t get chewed out in 
the moment,” Mortensen said. 
“… I don’t even remember what 
he said, because his reaction was 
so supportive, it didn’t make a 
lasting impression on me.”

What Mortensen does 

recall is what happened the 
next day in San Diego’s film 
session. Harbaugh showed 
his quarterback the film. He 
taught him how to avoid the 
mistake in the future. And most 
importantly, he stuck with his 
guy during the low point in the 
season.

Mortensen didn’t make any 

glaring mistakes the rest of the 
year, the offense averaged 44 
points in the last eight games and 
the Toreros finished 7-1.

“From that game on, I never 

had a game where I felt like I 
was the reason we didn’t win the 
game,” Mortensen said.

When Mortensen visited Ann 

Arbor last year for the Michigan-

BYU game, he introduced 
himself to then-Michigan 
quarterback Jake Rudock, who 
had a similar renaissance in the 
second half of last year, breaking 
out after a few rough games.

Last weekend, redshirt 

sophomore Wilton Speight 
entered the exclusive fraternity 
of Harbaugh’s starting 
quarterbacks. That club 
comes with a number of perks, 
including the mentorship of a 
coach who once starred at the 
position himself and has strong 
ties to the NFL.

But there’s another advantage 

to being Harbaugh’s quarterback, 
and it may be the most important 
one: complete, undying loyalty.

Of the 128 Football Bowl 

Subdivision teams, 17 played 
multiple quarterbacks in their 
season opener (for reasons other 
than injuries and blowouts). They 
weren’t insignificant names, 
either: Alabama’s Nick Saban, 
Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly and 
Texas’ Charlie Strong all hadn’t 
picked a definitive starter at 
the most important position in 
sports.

Needless to say, Harbaugh 

was not like them. He went with 
Speight after an eight-month 
competition — though he didn’t 
disclose it until kickoff — and 
will now almost certainly stick 
with Speight for the rest of the 
season, barring injury.

In fact, in his years in 

college, Harbaugh has almost 
never allowed a quarterback 
controversy. This is his ninth 
year as a college head coach. 
Only once has he had two 
quarterbacks throw more than 
25 passes each in a season. His 
backups play only due to injuries 
or in garbage time. He picks his 
guy and rolls with him.

And however he feels about 

his team, however his team fares, 
he is completely unwavering 
in his support of the starting 
quarterback.

Start with last season, when 

Harbaugh gave graduate transfer 
Jake Rudock the nod over then-
redshirt sophomore Shane 
Morris. Through three games, 
Michigan was 2-1 and Rudock had 
thrown for fewer than 200 yards 
per game and three touchdowns 
against just five interceptions. 
The following Monday, Harbaugh 
faced a question about where 
Rudock could improve, which he 
took as an insinuation of doubt at 
the position.

“Just, the question, to me 

— just the way you started the 
question off after the game, 
it’s like questions to divide and 
compare,” Harbaugh said. “… I 
sense sometimes the questions to 
compare and be divisive, so I’m 
quick to turn those off.”

Asked a follow-up, Harbaugh 

defended Rudock again: “To 
be clear, Jake Rudock’s the 
best quarterback. Not by a 
small margin. He’s our best 
quarterback. … I feel it’s divisive 
when you just pull out one name 
to just keep hammering; there, 
there, so hope that’s clear. He’s 
our best quarterback.”

As much as Rudock struggled 

in the first third of the season, 
Harbaugh wasn’t having any 
criticism, inquisition or even the 
slightest hint of an ambiguity at 
quarterback.

And his 

faith paid off, 
as Rudock 
polished off 
one of the 
best single 
seasons for a 
quarterback 
in Michigan 
history, 
leading the 
Wolverines to a 10-3 season.

That has been Harbaugh’s 

track record throughout his 
career. In 2004 at San Diego, 
his first head coaching job, 
Harbaugh chose Mortensen, 
who started all season. When 

Mortensen left, his old backup, 
Josh Johnson, took over for 2005 
and 2006.

The 2007 season was the only 

one of Harbaugh’s career with 
even a little ambiguity. That 

was when 
Harbaugh 
inherited a 
struggling 
program at 
Stanford 
and waffled 
between T.C. 
Ostrander 
(who started 
the first four 

games and the last one) and 
Tavita Pritchard (who got the 
nod in between).

In 2008, Harbaugh settled 

on Pritchard, and in 2009, 
he started a young redshirt 
freshman named Andrew Luck. 

Of Harbaugh’s all-time college 
starters, Johnson, Luck and 
Rudock — that’s half of them if 
you’re counting at home — are 
still in the NFL.

Now, Speight is the latest of 

Harbaugh’s pupils with that 
opportunity. In two starts, the 
results have been positive, albeit 
against lesser competition: 
Speight is 35-for-50 for 457 
yards with seven touchdowns 
and an interception.

But even during Speight’s 

costly mistakes — or mistake, 
singular, rather — Harbaugh has 
stood by him all the way, as usual.

The blip happened on the 

first offensive snap of the season 
opener. Speight rolled out to the 
right and tossed the ball into 
the waiting arms of Hawaii’s 
Damien Packer. Then Speight’s 
momentum carried him over to 

the sideline, where Harbaugh 
had an unusual reaction.

“He just grabbed me and 

hugged me and was kind of 
laughing and was like, ‘Don’t 
worry, we’ll get it next drive. 
Don’t sweat about that,’ ” Speight 
recalled.

Laughing? This is a man 

who doesn’t take a play off in 
pickup basketball games. And 
here’s his hand-picked starting 
quarterback giving the ball away 
on the first play of the first game, 
and Harbaugh laughs?

It sounds crazy, but it works. 

Speight will make more mistakes 
the rest of the season, but in 
Harbaugh, he has a quarterback’s 
most loyal ally.

Wilton Speight (center) can rest assured that Jim Harbaugh (right) will stand by him during tough times.

“From that game 

on, I never ... felt like 
I was the reason we 

didn’t win.”

through the air, the Wolverines’ 
rushing offense left something 
to be desired. Freshman wide 
receiver Eddie McDoom, freshman 
running back Chris Evans and 
senior running back De’Veon 
Smith all had their moments, but by 
and large, UCF seemed to have the 
right game plan against Michigan’s 
run game.

“You’ve gotta understand, in 

this game, you’re gonna always 
have mistakes, no matter what,” 
Hill said. “Our defense made some 
mistakes, but they also corrected 
those mistakes. Our offense made 
mistakes, but we also corrected our 
mistakes. We didn’t just keep doing 
it over and over.”

And with the score as lopsided 

as it was, it’s hard to argue.

Fifth-year senior Kenny Allen 

made three field goals, tying a 
career high, and Michigan altered 
two UCF punts and two kicks, one 
of which was an outright block.

Michigan put in its backup 

quarterback, redshirt junior John 
O’Korn, with 6:07 remaining, and 
it wore down the clock still up by a 
comfortable 37.

The Wolverines did what they 

were expected to. They took care 
of business.

Harbaugh said. “Real football 
player. Doing a great job.”

Expectations have always been 

high for Gary, the top-ranked 
recruit in the nation last year, from 
the February day he committed 
during Michigan’s “Signing of the 
Stars” ceremony to the April night 
he came out to a loud ovation from 
fans at the Spring Game.

Tuesday, after his first day 

of classes, Gary said he tries to 
shy away from that attention 
whenever possible.

“I try to stay low, but yeah, a 

couple people know me and they’ll 
say hi, take pictures,” Gary said. 
“But besides that, you see me with 
a hoodie on.”

Asked if that works, Gary said, 

“Sometimes. But I’m 6-foot-5, so it 
don’t always work.”

At this rate, it’s going to get 

harder every week.

Chase Winovich finds a home

C

hase Winovich has 
been a member of the 
Michigan football team 

for three 
seasons, 
worn three 
jersey 
numbers 
and worked 
at three 
different 
positions, 
and up 
until last 
Saturday, he 
had almost 
nothing to show for it.

For most of his first two years 

as a Wolverine, the three-star 
recruit from Jefferson Hills, 
Pa., was a player without a role, 
moving from position group 
to position group without his 
coaching staff being able to find 
him a suitable fit.

Winovich entered as a 

linebacker, redshirted his first 
season under then-Michigan 
coach Brady Hoke and moved to 
tight end under new coach Jim 
Harbaugh last year. He spent 

most of his time playing on the 
scout team, seeing game action 
just six times. But at the end 
of last season, with his team 
preparing for the Citrus Bowl 
against Florida, Winovich got in 
on some plays at defensive end 
during a scrimmage — despite 
not even knowing the scheme or 
the defense — and permanently 
changed the path of his career.

For the few plays he was on 

the field, Winovich immediately 
caught the eye of the coaching 
staff — later, he said, he found 
out that the entire defensive 
staff gathered in a post-
scrimmage film session to 
watch one play that he made. 
Right then, it was decided: 
Winovich would be moving to 
defensive end.

“I think they believed in me 

from the beginning,” Winovich 
said, “and I believed in myself.”

* * *

Saturday, Winovich stood in 

the Crisler Center media room, 
surrounded by reporters after 

making the first start of his 
college career.

After a strong spring for 

Winovich and an injury to 
senior defensive end Taco 
Charlton last week, Winovich 
learned earlier this week that 
he had been chosen to take 
Charlton’s place in the lineup 
against Central Florida. He 
was so excited that he could 
barely sleep 
last night, 
and he posted 
the news 
on Twitter, 
vowing to 
“represent the 
best university 
in the world” 
with his first 
start.

And 

impress Winovich did, picking 
up five tackles and his first 
career sack, knocking the ball 
out of UCF quarterback Justin 
Holman’s hands in the process.

After the game, with most of 

his family standing just a few 
feet away in the media room, 

Winovich’s voice nearly cracked 
as he attempted to express the 
emotion he was feeling.

“I’m not gonna lie and say 

that I was perfect out there, 
because nobody was,” he said. 
“But I felt like I left it all out 
there. And this one … this one 
today was for my family. They 
always believe in me. … Just 
to have the opportunity to 

go out there 
— people 
can’t take 
that away 
from me. 
There’s not a 
lot of things 
that really 
tug at my 
heartstrings, 
but that’s one 
of them.”

Winovich isn’t the only player 

who has thrived thanks to 
Harbaugh’s willingness to move 
players around the field. Redshirt 
junior fullback Khalid Hill played 
tight end last year but now has 
three touchdowns in two games. 
Junior center Mason Cole has 
transitioned seamlessly from 
being a starting left tackle.

But Hill and Cole were both 

experienced players who likely 
would have found playing 
time anyway — Winovich’s 
metamorphosis is harder to 
understand.

How exactly did he do it? 

How could a player who had 
little to no success for two years 
suddenly save his career at a 
third position?

If you ask him, he’ll cite 

an unexpected source of 
inspiration.

“(My brother) sent me this 

quote by Bruce Lee,” Winovich 
said. “He talks about water. 
‘Water can flow, water can 
crash. If you put water in a 
bottle, it becomes the bottle. 
If you put water in a cup, it 
becomes the cup.’

“Be shapeless — that was the 

moral of the story. Whatever 
mold they tried to put on me, 
I tried to learn. I’m not gonna 
lie, it’s tough. Sometimes, (if) 
you’ve been playing football 
your whole life, you get set in 
your own ways and how you do 

stuff and how you think stuff 
works, and you go in there and 
you get absolutely torn apart 
by Coach Mattison for doing it 
that way. You reevaluate your 
life and everything you’ve gotta 
do — which needs to happen — 
and you go out there the next 
day and say, ‘Well, I’m gonna 
go out there today and do it 
the right way.’ … I felt like I 
improved my game a lot of ways 
and was shapeless.”

After the immediate emotion 

wore off following the game, 
Winovich transformed into an 
ecstatic ball of energy, quoting 
everyone from UFC fighters 
Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz 
(on his fighting mentality) to 
his father, Peter (comparing 
settling in at his new position 
to his dad coming home from 
work and shouting, “Honey, I’m 
home! Put the steaks on!”)

The last quote may have 

been the most appropriate — 
Winovich sure seems at home 
now. Instead of putting in 
long hours on the scout team 
or trying his best to provide 
depth on offense, he can 
relax and do what he’s most 
comfortable doing.

“It just lets me get out there 

and play,” Winovich said. 
“Sometimes you don’t choose 
your passion — your passion 
chooses you.”

After the “shapeless” 

journeyman was finally done 
answering questions, reporters 
parted and left behind one of 
the only people in the room who 
looked happier than Winovich 
— his father. Without skipping 
a beat, Winovich walked up to 
him and wrapped him in a giant 
bear hug.

The Winovich family left 

the room together and ducked 
through a side door that opened 
up into the bowels of Crisler 
Center, Peter Winovich still 
basking in the culmination of 
his son’s journey.

“I always wanted to see what 

the furnace room looked like,” 
he said.

Five things we learned: 
Wolverines 51, UCF 14

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

rolled to another blowout victory 
Saturday, 
trouncing 
Central 

Florida, 51-14.

And after our first week of 

classes, we at the Daily were in the 
mood to do some more learning in 
the press box.

So that’s what we did. Here are 

five things we learned from this 
weekend.

1. Beware the big play.
Of the 275 rushing yards 

Michigan allowed Saturday, 212 
of those yards came on five plays. 
That doesn’t make the number 
any less significant — Michigan 
has much better teams to play this 
season that would happily take 
five big plays — but it does give it a 
different meaning.

Had the Wolverines given 

up 275 rushing yards by getting 
consistently pounded for 8-10 
yards, that would be a sign of 
systemic problems on the defense. 
Instead, the stat can be chalked 
up to either a handful of great 
offensive 
plays, 
or 
defensive 

lapses.

UCF 
broke 
the 
Michigan 

contain more than defensive 
coordinator Don Brown probably 
would have liked, and against 
quarterbacks like Ohio State’s JT 
Barrett, that could be an issue. 
But there’s a lot of football to be 
played between now and then, 
and there’s no reason to believe 
Michigan can’t shore up some of 
its big-play faults.

Still, 
it’s 
a 
dent 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ armor, and one they 
would be wise to close up quickly.

2. The linebackers may be 

better than we thought.

When 
Michigan’s 
entire 

starting 
linebacker 
corps 

graduated after last season, many 

were 
(justifiably) 
concerned 

with their replacements. But 
through two games, the group has 
answered its doubters.

Redshirt 
junior 
linebacker 

Mike McCray was the Big Ten 
Defensive Player of the Week in 
Week 1, and he had another strong 
game against the Knights with six 
tackles, one and a half for loss, and 
a forced fumble.

Senior Ben Gedeon combined 

with freshman defensive end 
Rashan Gary for a 12-yard sack, 
and Jabrill Peppers continues to 
be Jabrill Peppers. Against Hawaii 
and UCF, that bunch was solid.

Soon, though, they will go up 

against 
stronger 
competition 

— possibly as soon as this week 
but certainly by the start of the 
October. McCray, Gedeon and 
Peppers will be judged by how 
they play in those games, not the 
ones Michigan wins by 37.

But for now, there’s not much 

to complain about. That’s a good 
start.

3. Special teams will be OK 

without John Baxter.

Four altered kicks alone make 

a good special teams day. Add 
in the fact that Jabrill Peppers 
nearly returned another punt 
for a touchdown and that the 
Wolverines started five drives in 
UCF territory, and it becomes a 
great one.

After special teams coordinator 

John 
Baxter 
departed 
for 

Southern 
California 
this 

offseason, it was fair to wonder 
whether Michigan’s special teams 
— much improved last season — 
would regress. Saturday should 
quell some of those concerns.

Tyree Kinnel tipped two punts, 

and Chris Wormley got his hands 
on a pair of field goals, in what 
was the best attacking day the 
Wolverines’ special teams have 
had in some time.

Only one of the kicks went down 

as an official block — Wormley’s 
first, in the first quarter — but 
they all contributed to Michigan’s 
dominance in the third phase. The 
Wolverines won’t be able to do it 
each week, but the more fear they 
can put in kickers and punters, the 
better off they’ll be.

4. Deep passes are a go.
It took Jake Rudock more 

than half of last season to figure 
out the deep passing game with 
his receivers. Once he found his 
touch, Rudock turned in one of the 
best quarterback seasons in recent 
school history, due in large part to 
his success throwing downfield.

Two weeks into 2016, redshirt 

junior quarterback Wilton Speight 
seems to have already found that 
stroke.

Speight linked up for big gains 

with each of his top three targets 
— senior tight end Jake Butt and 
fifth-year senior receivers Amara 
Darboh and Jehu Chesson — 
including a 45-yard touchdown to 
Darboh in the first quarter.

Getting the deep ball to work 

consistently would be huge for the 
Wolverines, who have arguably 
the most receiving depth of 
anyone in the Big Ten.

5. Bold Prediction: Khalid 

Hill gets two more touchdowns 
next week.

A year ago, predicting Hill to 

get any rushing touchdown would 
be bold. Now, he has more on the 
season than any other Wolverine.

Since his conversion from tight 

end, Hill has shown high value 
in short-yardage situations. That 
value will be highlighted against 
a Colorado team that should be 
significantly better than either 
team Michigan has faced thus far.

The Wolverines will score, but 

they’ll have to work for it, and 
that’s when fullbacks make their 
name.

‘M’ routs UC Riverside

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

At halftime of Friday’s match 

against UC Riverside, Michigan 
women’s soccer coach Greg Ryan 
recognized 
his 
team’s 

offensive 
system 
wasn’t matching up with the 
Highlanders. He felt his team 
wasn’t 
playing 
aggressively 

enough, and made the proper 
adjustment heading into the final 
half.

For the last 45 minutes, the 

adjustment paid off.

In the 59th minute, Abby 

Kastroll cradled the ball on 
the flank, and the sophomore 
midfielder used her unmatched 
speed to take the ball along the 
right side. With enough space 
to create a scoring opportunity, 
she crossed the ball in front of 
the mouth of the goal — past 
three defenders — to sophomore 
forward 
Reilly 
Martin, 
who 

kicked the ball through the legs of 
goalkeeper Alanna Guzman.

There were plenty more goals 

to come for the Wolverines (4-1-
1) in their 4-0 shutout of UC 
Riverside at U-M Soccer Stadium. 
In Michigan’s second straight 
shutout, the game boiled down 
to amplified offensive pressure, 

playing the ball forward and 
keeping the Highlanders on their 
heels in the second half.

“(In the) first half, UC Riverside 

came out really strong,” Kastroll 
said. “We came in the second half, 
changed our tactics and just went 
at them and it ended up working 
out for us. We realized that goal-
scoring opportunities weren’t just 
going to come, we had to work for 
them.”

With 
one 
goal 
on 
the 

scoreboard, it took until the 81st 
minute for the second — the first 
of a three-goal flurry that came in 
the final 10 minutes of regulation. 
After the ball flew over her head 
and began rolling toward the goal, 
Kastroll sprinted onto it, put one 
touch on the ball and rocketed it 
into the net from 18 yards out.

Whether she was weaving in 

and out of defenders, winning 
loose balls or challenging the 
goalkeeper on every potential 
goal-scoring opportunity, Kastroll 
made her presence felt all over the 
field, all night. It was only a matter 
of time until one of her shots fell.

“I like just to go hard because 

it’s just pretty motivating for 
the team,” Kastroll said. “Some 
people react to someone yelling at 
them (to) do better or encouraging 
them, I just like to go into a tackle 
to get the team going.”

Four 
minutes 
later, 
senior 

midfielder Jessica Heifetz scored 
her first goal of the season off a 
corner kick, when she launched 
the ball through the legs of 
Guzman off a short bounce. Soon 
after, junior midfielder Rubina 
Veerakone served the ball into the 
box, and freshman forward Grace 
Salvino got a piece of it before it 
went in for her first career goal.

In the second half, UC Riverside 

rarely made it past midfield, and 
Michigan’s defense limited the 
Highlanders to only one shot — 
three for the game. With a five-
woman back line captained by 
redshirt sophomore goalkeeper 
Sarah Jackson, the Wolverines 
outmatched and outnumbered 
their opponent.

“I think we just put them 

on their back foot with all the 
pressure,” Ryan said. “No goals 
against Ole Miss, no goals against 
Notre Dame, no goals again 
tonight. Defensively they’re doing 
a great job. ”

Friday’s match marked the end 

of 
Michigan’s 
non-conference 

slate, which means the Wolverines 
are inching even closer to their 
primary goal of winning a Big Ten 
championship. But Michigan is 
not letting its guard down.

“We’re definitely not content 

going into the Big Ten play,” 
Kastroll said. “We’re hungry for 
more.”
