Fifth annual 
ceremony gives 

array of awards to 
groups, individuals

By ISHI MORI

For the Daily

About 
100 
University 
of 

Michigan students, faculty and 
staff celebrated the fifth annual 

Michigan Difference Student 
Leadership Awards Thursday 
night at the Michigan Union’s 
Rogel Ballroom.

Hosted by the University’s 

division of Student Life, the 
event recognized individual 
students as well as student 
organizations 
that 
have 

made a positive difference on 
campus and in surrounding 
communities. Nominees were 
selected from a pool of online 
applications submitted both 

by 
prospective 
nominees 

and 
recommendations 
from 

students.

Steve 
Bodei, 
assistant 

director of student development 
and experiential learning, said 
earlier iterations of the awards 
ceremony 
have 
been 
more 

academically-oriented, which 
attendees found discouraging.

“Originally, 
the 
award 

ceremony was drier, academic 
… it was during (the) day and 
no one really came,” Bodei said. 

“We really tried to spice it up 
and put a lot of life into it.”

He said the event committee 

within Student Life remodeled 
the event to recognize students 
across campus and disciplines 
they 
believe 
are 
doing 

remarkable work.

Awards 
in 
multiple 

categories were given out this 
year, including Cross Cultural 
Programming, Excellence in 
Philanthropy and Outstanding

Due to rising prices and the 

increased availability and use 
of specialty drugs, the cost of 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

prescription 
plan 
through 

the University Benefits Office 
increased significantly in 2015.

Specialty drugs are defined 

as 
high-cost 
drugs 
used 
in 

cases 
requiring 
specialized 

medications, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, multiple sclerosis and 
oncology.

The prescription plan itself 

cost $121.6 million in 2015 — a 
15.8-percent increase since 2014. 
The total cost on a per-member 
per-month 
basis 
would 
be 

13.4-percent increase, ultimately 
making the cost of the plan $15 
million more than 2014.

Group asks 

audience about 
trust in state 
government 

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

The Center for Michigan held 

a polling event in Ann Arbor 
Wednesday, during which 68 
percent of attendees said their 

trust in Michigan’s government is 
“low” or “very low.”

The event, held at the Ford 

School of Public Policy and 
attended 
by 
25 
community 

members, 
aimed 
to 
gather 

research on public trust in state 
government. 
Polling 
topics 

included 
the 
government’s 

ability to protect public health, 
provide services for low-income 
families and foster economic 
growth, as well as the fairness of 
the emergency manager system 
and term limits in the Michigan 

legislature. The group plans to 
publish their findings with the 
aim of affecting policy change in 
Michigan. 

The center is a non-profit 

organization that gathers data to 
gauge how residents feel about 
state-wide issues. During the 
event, each of the 25 people in 
attendance was given a clicker to 
respond to a variety of questions 
regarding their level of trust in 
the state government.

Bipolar disorder 
and solutions to it 
focus of movie and 

discussion 

By NISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Depression 

Center aired an early showing 
of 
the 
PBS 
documentary 

“Ride the Tiger: A Guide 
Through the Bipolar Brain” 
Wednesday 
along 
with 
a 

panel discussion featuring 
researchers, activists and Ed 
Moore, the film’s producer 
and director.

The 
film 
features 

prominent 
figures 
living 

with bipolar disorder such 
as Academy Award-winning 
actress 
Patty 
Duke, 
who 

passed away Tuesday. Melvin 
McInnis, research director 
for the Heinz C. Prechter 
Bipolar Research Fund at 
the 
University, 
made 
an 

appearance both in the film 

and as the panel’s moderator. 
He 
discussed 
hisresearch, 

which compares the brain 
matter of those with bipolar 
disorder to those without, by 
working with stem cells.

Moore 
said 
the 
film’s 

initial focus was on bipolar 
entrepreneurs 
who, 
in 

anticipation 
of 
a 
heavy 

workload 
and 
need 
for 

professionalism, 
stopped 

taking their medication. This 
is known as “riding the tiger,” 
which Moore said is similar 
to a Chinese proverb about 
a fear of facing reality, and 
can result in patients’ driving 
themselves into hypomania, 
a persistent state of mood 
elevation.

The 
panel 
discussion, 

which 
featured 
people 

from the documentary, was 
livestreamedon 
the 
PBS 

website, following the film 
screening.

Moore said he was informed 

early on by one of the film’s 
advisers that the goal of the 
documentary should be to 
spread knowledge about the 

Messages like “Stop 

Islam” on Diag 

draw student calls 

for action

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Several 
political 
and 

religious statements chalked on 
the Diag this week, including 
“Stop Islam,” “Trump 2016” 
and “Build the Wall,” prompted 
students to call University of 
Michigan 
police 
Wednesday 

and group together to wash the 
chalkings off.

Though the phrases were 

written 
in 
chalk, 
students 

gathered 
on 
the 
Diag 

Wednesday 
afternoon 
said 

they thought the effects of 
them were more permanent on 
campus climate.

Rackham 
student 
Banen 

Al-Sheemary said she and fellow 
students who encountered the 
writing and gathered in the 
Diag found the sayings hurtful 

and disturbing. 

“This is so reflective of 

our student campus and the 
depths 
of 
racism 
and 
the 

things that students of color 
have to endure and that the 
administration is continuously 
silent on,” Al-Sheemary said. 
“This is just another example. 
This is happening year after 
year and we’ve been telling the 
administration the same things 
over and over again.”

Al-Sheemary 
said 
she 

and other students had been 
attempting 
to 
contact 
the 

University’s Division of Public 
Safety and Security as well as 
the University’s administration 
regarding the writing since 
Wednesday morning without 
much response.

“I’ve been getting bounced 

around from one person to 
another, and I understand it’s 
after hours, but there should be 
some kind of emergency number 
besides the police because a lot 
of students of color don’t feel 
comfortable calling the police,” 
Al-Sheemary said. “They’re our

An online petition for the 

University of Michigan to include 
student pronouns on class rosters 
and disclose them to professors 
has continued to gain traction 
over recent weeks and may see 
action shortly.

Organizers plan to approach 

administrators such as 
University Provost Martha 
Pollack and Kedra Ishop, 
associate vice president for 
Enrollment Management, 
once the petition reaches 500 
signatures. As of Wednesday 
evening, it had 432.

“Trans students at the 

University of Michigan often 
find themselves facing threats 
to their mental and physical 
safety,” the petition reads. 
“Currently, students must reach 
out to their professors and 
GSIs on their own or risk being 
misgendered in the classroom. 
This can be a mentally and 
emotionally draining experience 
for individuals who constantly 
have to inform or correct their 
professors of their identity.”

It cites Harvard as an 

example of one of the other 

universities across the country 
implementing similar policies.

“This is an extremely 

important issue on campus,” 
Kinesiology junior Katherine 
Baur wrote in the comments 
of the petition. “Allowing 
professors/GSIs to know the 
pronoun preferences of students 
will not only make students feel 
more comfortable on campus, but 
will also hopefully augment their 
ability to learn.”

LSA senior Joseph Beattie 

commented that a policy like this 
would help foster an inclusive 
environment at the University.

“Students should feel safe, 

comfortable and included as 

members of this campus, and the 
University should do all within 
its power to ensure that students 
do feel this way,” Beattie wrote.

As well, Public Health student 

Adam Eickmeyer noted in the 
comments that implementing 
such a policy would also be 
beneficial for instructors.

“As a GSI, this would 

be a great addition for both 
instructors and students,” 
Eickmeyer wrote. “We need to 
support our trans* and gender 
nonconforming/nonbinary 
students on campus, and this is 
an easy way to do so.”

only resource and that I think is 
ridiculous.”

One 
DPSS 
officer 
arrived 

at the scene around 6:45 p.m 
Wednesday, 
but 
informed 

students that there was not much 
that could be done because it was 
after hours. In response, a group 
of about ten students began to 
wash the chalk messages off 
the Diag with water and towels 
themselves, pouring buckets of 
water to erase the statements 
and wiping down other concrete 
with rags.

“It’s 
irresponsible 
of 
the 

administration 
that 
we 
are 

actually out here with buckets 
of water and napkins to clean 
off 
these 
hateful 
messages 

and the administration isn’t 
taking care of it,” Al-Sheemary 
said. “And not only is the 
administration not taking care 
of it, they are putting us through 
a really difficult process. That 
perpetuates these really racist 
and hateful stereotypes that 
turn into violence and turn into 
students of color feeling unsafe 

on campus.”

LSA junior Tahany Alsabahi, 

one 
of 
the 
students 
who 

contacted 
DPSS, 
echoed 

Al-Sheemary’s sentiments.

“There needs to be another 

resource for students, and I 
think, 
also, 
the 
University 

has to speak out against these 
things,” Alsabahi said. “because 
oftentimes when this happens 
for other groups, they’re very 
quick to release statements and 
say that they don’t condone 
anti-Semitism or any other type 
of stuff like that, but it gets 
really iffy and it becomes really 
difficult to get them to speak out 
against Islamophobia.”

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald affirmed the 
University’s stance on inclusivity 
on 
campus 
in 
a 
statement 

Wednesday night.

“Earlier today someone used 

chalk to write a #stopislam 
message on the main square in 
the heart of our campus known 
as the Diag,” the statement 
read. “Attacks directed toward 
any member or group within 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

community, based on a belief or 
characteristic, are inconsistent 

with our values of respect, 
civility and equality. We all 
understand that where speech 
is free it will sometimes wound. 
But our message is this: We are 
fully committed to fostering an 
environment that is welcoming 
and 
inclusive 
of 
everyone. 

Tonight we are reminded there 
is much work yet to be done.”

Al-Sheemary 
said 
she 

was not surprised by either 
the various writings for and 
against Republican presidential 
candidate Donald Trump, or 
statements 
targeting 
Muslim 

students.

“It’s 
nothing 
new,” 

Al-Sheemary said. “Maybe it 
has just been heightened with 
the election, but this is just 
something that happened before 
9/11, spiked with 9/11 and it’s not 
anything new and it affects a lot 
of students of color.”

Alsabahi also noted that she 

thought statements like those 
on the Diag had connotations 
beyond political.

“When 
speech 
can 
incite 

violence and aggression and 
hatred towards another group, 
that’s when it becomes hate 
speech,” she said.

reality of bipolar disorder and 
treatment, which he said he 
found surprising.

“I had no idea that there is 

a segment of the population 
where they still prescribed, 
as Patty Duke had put it, may 
she rest in peace, that you pull 
yourself up by your bootstraps. 
You can do this,” Moore said. 
“You just got to get out there 
and get with it (mentally). And 
it’s not that simple.”

The film emphasized the 

biological 
components 
of 

the disorder and the swings 
between mania and depression. 
One 
of 
the 
panelists 
was 

activist 
and 
award-winning 

writer Melody Moezzi, whose 
manic episode was portrayed in 
the film.

Moezzi 
said 
Wednesday 

she felt like some of her 
feelings were misrepresented 
in the documentary as being 

delusional, 
and 
that 
the 

narration of the documentary 
spoke for her at times. In 
particular, she said, despite the 
unusual nature of her actions, 
the spirit of them was not given 
proper credit.

“Though my delusion was 

accurately portrayed as being 
that I could change the world 
through hula-hooping and I 
could bring out world peace 
through hula-hooping, which is 
mildly delusional, I get it,” she 
said. “But I do believe that one 
person can change the world.”

She also discussed how the 

stigma of mental illness can 
be a greater difficulty than the 
bipolarism itself, saying she 
now she recognizes the signs 
and she can take measures to 
prevent outbursts.

She noted that if she had a 

cure for bipolar disorder, in 
the form of a drug, she would 
not know if she would take it, 
saying she appreciated that her 
mind works differently than 
others’.

The 
film 
discussed 

several 
treatment 
options 

for 
individuals 
to 
have 
a 

more 
comfortable 
lifestyle, 

emphasizing 
talk 
therapy, 

connecting with the family, 
exercise, dieting and getting 
regular sleep.

The 
film 
also 
discussed 

more 
unusual 
methods 
of 

approaching mental such as 
electric shock therapy, which 
despite its negative history due 
to its severity, was portrayed 
as beneficial to bipolar and 
depressed 
patients 
in 
the 

film. Ketamine, an anesthetic, 
was 
also 
featured 
— 
the 

film 
highlighted 
research 

that showed how soldiers in 
Vietnam 
thought 
the 
drug 

lightened their mood.

Another 
panelist, 
Ellen 

Forney, 
a 
cartoonist 
and 

award-winning 
writer, 
said 

artists with bipolar disorder 
sometimes allow the condition 
to become part of the creative 
process.

Forney mentioned yoga being 

a large part of her routine, and 
emphasized how connectivity 
and therapy is as important 
to those with bipolar disorder 
as well as individual action. 
Moezzi 
agreed, 
and 
said 

her Muslim faith helped her 
manage her condition.

McInnis 
said 
he 
wanted 

University students to take 
away tips to maintain a healthy 
lifestyle from the film.

“What 
I 
want 
Michigan 

students to gain from this 
is to have an awareness of 
their moods, and awareness 
that their moods can cycle 
up and down, and there are 
pathological states that can 
emerge from mood,” McInnis 
said. “I also want them to hear 
the message of healthy sleep 
patterns, 
healthy 
exercise 

patterns, 
healthy 
dietary 

patterns and the connectivity 
that is important in healthy 
living. Living health implies 
being health and vice versa.”

The 
documentary 
will 

premiere on PBS on April 13.

The last award given out 

was the World Leaders Awar, 
to Rama Mwenesi, a graduate 
student in the College of 
Engineering and School of 
Public 
Health. 
Mwenesi 

co-founded Kiamani MVMT, 
a social enterprise that aims 
to empower Kenyan women 
and children orphaned by 
HIV/AIDS. 
He 
also 
won 

the Graduate Student of the 
Year Award for his work as 
a Health Care Management 
Engineering Consultant in the 
hospital. For Mwenesi, this 
year marked his third World 
Leaders Award.

“To do it once, you’re really 

humbled. To do it twice, you’re 
inspired to really believe in 
yourself and your team and 
those around you and the idea 
to actually affect and impact 
change,” Mwenesi said. “But 
to win it a third time is … 

there’s just no words for it.”

Mwenesi said he hoped 

students will learn from his 
example and employ sincerity, 
commitment and passion to 
affect change.

E. Royster Harper, vice 

president for student life, said 
Mwenesi’s enthusiasm was 
exactly the kind she was eager 
to see.

“It’s just really affirming 

others 
acknowledging 
the 

work 
(the 
students) 
are 

doing,” 
Harper 
said. 
“To 

me, it’s one of the reasons 
why the University is really 
such a special place. And the 
contributions that students 
make here, they take it and go 
out and change the world. I 
really like that.”

Business senior Jennifer 

Liu said she appreciated how 
the ceremony gave recognition 
to small and quiet groups that 
contribute greatly to society.

“Group 
are 
represented 

from North Campus, South 
Campus, 
Central 
Campus, 

and 
it’s 
really 
bringing 

the 
entire 
community 

together to celebrate student 
accomplishments,” she said.

Sustainability 
progress outlined 
in annual report

The University released 

its 2015 Sustainability 
Progress Report Wednesday, 
highlighting their efforts for 
a healthier and greener planet 
and University environment.

The report outlined progress 

the University has made with 
regard to sustainability goals 
for climate, waste prevention 
and community awareness, 
according to the University 
press release. 

“Like the very best qualities 

of the University of Michigan, 
our work in sustainability is 
more than the sum of our many 
excellent parts,” said University 
President Mark Schlissel in the 
press release. 

Multiple efforts are being 

funded by the University to 
encourage sustainability and 
progress in areas including 
waste and greenhouse gas 
reduction. 

There are multiple goals 

for the University’s future 
sustainability programs, 
including protecting the Huron 
River through stormwater 
control strategies, reducing 
chemical application by 36 
percent and purchasing more 
University food from local and 
sustainable sources, according 
to the report.

Lincoln Project 
brought to campus

The Lincoln Project, 

a project focusing on the 
importance of access to public 
higher education, will come 
to the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus this Monday. 

Former University President 

Mary Sue Coleman and former 
chancellor of the University 
of California, Berkeley Robert 
Birgeneau have led the Lincoln 
Project for the last three years 
to draw attention to the effects 
that lower state investment in 
public higher education could 
have, as well as the role that the 
government plays in funding 
public research universities.

Following its introduction 

to campus Monday, the 
Lincoln Project will make 
recommendations encouraging 
the development of federal, 
corporate and philanthropic 
financial sources for 
maintaining and establishing 
public higher education 
nationwide, according to the 
University press release.

The program will take place 

in the Vandenberg Room of 
the Michigan League at 5 
p.m. and will explore multiple 
questions regarding how public 
universities can address the 
financial challenges they face.

Research suggests 
personality could 
impact e-mail style

Recent University research 

found personality traits will 
influence how people respond 
to typos and grammatical 
errors.

According to the 

University press release, 
while extroverted people 
are more likely to overlook 
typos and grammatical errors, 
introverted people judge those 
who send the e-mail errors 
more harshly.

Linguistics and Psychology 

Prof. Julie Boland said in a 
press release that the study 
examined social judgments 
made by readers among 83 
participants of the study. The 
participants read typos and 
grammatical errors and then 
were asked to rate the e-mail 
in terms of the friendliness and 
level of intelligence from the 
sender they perceived.

Intuitively, those 

who reported grammar 
as important prior to 
participating in the 
experiment were also more 
likely to be bothered by errors 
following the experiment.

Gerber, who previously worked 
with the center, introduced 
the event and the center’s 
goals in research and the state 
government.

“The center considers itself 

a think-and-do tank,” Gerber 
said. “Its primary mission is to 
go beyond research.”

Gerber said events such 

as this aim to collect data for 
research in order to push a non-
partisan, centrist policy agenda 
in the state legislature.

“This 
is 
an 
important 

part of what we do,” Gerber 
said. “Engaging in in-depth 
conversations about important 
issues with lots of different 
people around the state.”

Center 
Outreach 

Coordinator Dwayne Barnes, 
who moderated the polling, said 
this event is the fourth in their 
larger community conversation 
campaign. He added that the 
center will put on similar 
events around the state of 
Michigan for the remainder of 
the calendar year. 

According to data provided 

by the center, only 20 percent 
of Michigan residents currently 
trust the state government 
“most of the time.” The area 
where participants typically 
placed the least trust in state 

government was in their ability 
to protect public health. All 
25 people polled Wednesday 
answered that their trust was 
“low” or “very low” in this 
area of the state government, 
and the Flint water crisis was 
discussed as a possible cause of 
this significant distrust.

The 
participants 
placed 

the most trust in the state 
government to foster economic 
growth. However, even then, 
only 32 percent said they had a 
“high” level of trust.

Barnes 
said 
location 

within Michigan could affect 
participant responses due to 
varying political beliefs in 
certain geographic areas.

“As we go across the state, no 

conversation is the same, and 
that’s what makes this job so 
unique,” he said.

Rackham student Jennifer 

Mann said she participated 
in the event because she 
had heard about the center 
and 
was 
curious 
about 

how they facilitated these 
conversations.

“I think you’re hearing from 

a lot of different viewpoints and 
different voter bases,” Mann 
said. “We’re coming at things 
from different perspectives, but 
you end up hearing somewhat 
similar threads throughout, 
which is kind of encouraging to 
hear about a population living 
in a similar area.”

for benefits, said the Benefits 
Office works with vendors to 
develop plans for aspects such 
as dental and visual coverage, 
prescription 
drugs 
and 

retirement.

“The 
Benefits 
Office 
is 

responsible 
for 
developing 

strategy 
and 
developing 

subsequently our health and 
welfare plans for all University 
faculty and staff,” Holcomb 
said.

Keith Bruhnsen, prescription 

drug plan assistant director 
and manager for the Benefits 
Office, said the prescription 
plan specifically covers nearly 
103,000 beneficiaries, including 
faculty and staff members, 
retirees and the dependents of 
these individuals.

“The prescription plan is a 

self-insured, self-administered 
plan by the University in which 
we provide coverage for out-
patient prescription drugs for 
all of our beneficiaries that are 
enrolled in any of the various 
health plans that we offer,” 
Bruhnsen said.

The prescription plan is part 

of University efforts to limit 
how much beneficiaries pay 
for health care, according to 
the Benefits office. The plan 
recommends a number of ways 
to save money on prescriptions 
such as requesting generic 
medications when possible to 
pay the lowest available copay, 
using the preferred drug list 
to pay a lower copay on brand 
name prescriptions and using 
mail order programs to save 
much of the original copay 
costs.

“The University took control 

of managing our prescription 
drug plan back in 2003 so 
that we could maintain both a 
quality plan for the University 
and its members, but also 
provide 
some 
strong 
cost-

containment strategies in terms 
of managing the plan toward 
appropriate use and utilizing 
the internal expertise of the 
faculty and staff here to help us 
in our operations and strategic 
planning,” Bruhnsen said.

Prior to 2003, prescription 

drugs were embedded within 
each medical plan, he said. 
Each medical plan — whether 
through 
Blue 
Cross, 
Care 

Choices HMO Plan, HAP HMO 
Plan or other plans — would 
monitor and manage its own 
drug plans, but coverage of 
drugs was sometimes different 
from one plan to another. 
Members were moving from 
plan to plan in order to get 
the coverage they needed at a 
particular time.

As the cost of prescription 

drugs increased, a University 
task force studied these plans 
and made a recommendation 
to executive officers to include 
a prescription drug plan with 
other benefits to better manage 
cost trends. 

Along with general economic 

inflation and use of specialty 

drugs, an increase in Food and 
Drug Administration approval 
for 
more 
specialty 
drugs 

also contributed to the cost 
increase, Holcomb said. These 
specialty drugs require careful 
management, dispensing and 
monitoring, and can often 
result 
in 
dramatic 
health 

care improvements for some 
conditions.

In 
particular 
Holcomb 

cited the release of specialty 
drugs for treating hepatitis 
C a year ago, which cost 
patients nearly $90,000 for 
an eight- to 12-week course 
of treatment. Between 95 and 
100 percent of the patients who 
used this prescription drug 
received complete remission 
of the disease, indicating the 
necessity for the prescription 
drug plan to cover particularly 
costly and specialty drugs.

Though only 1.6 percent 

of the 949,000 prescriptions 
that 
were 
dispensed 
last 

year through the plan are 
specialty 
medications, 
$40 

million was spent in 2015 
on 
these 
prescriptions 

through the plan. This was 
a significant percentage — 
about 37 percent — of the total 
cost of the prescription drug 
plan, Bruhnsen said. Due to 
upcoming developments in the 
pharmaceutical industry, he 
said he expects this percentage 
to increase to nearly 50 percent 
of the prescription drug plan’s 
total cost.

Because 
of 
these 
cost 

increases, the University holds a 
separate contract for both mail-
order pharmacy and specialty 
pharmacy, due to it being a more 
cost-effective 
arrangement. 

For example, NoviXus, a mail 
order pharmacy, supplies larger 
quantities 
of 
maintenance 

medication at a reduced copay. 
Maintenance 
medications 

include those taken on a regular 
basis, such as medications 
for high-cholesterol or birth 
control. The University uses 
its own hospital pharmacy 
specialty service for narcotic-
based medications that cannot 
be shipped via the NoviXux 
mail-order pharmacy.

“(Mail-order prescriptions) 

are more cost-effective than 
retail 
pharmacies 
because 

they automate all of their 
processing and they mail it and 
it’s very convenient,” Holcomb 
said. “They usually turn the 
prescription around in less than 
a day and often people receive it 
the next day in their mailbox. 
They have…low error rate and 
very high satisfaction from the 
surveys that we’ve done with 
our membership.”

Ultimately, employees and 

other beneficiaries are not 
personally 
penalized 
due 

to these increasing costs — 
members have the same level 
of 
cost-sharing 
copayment 

regardless 
of 
whether 
the 

medication is a low-cost or 
specialty medication — but in 
general, the cost of health care 
will continue to increase due 
to these medicinal advances, 
according to Holcomb.

C

HARLIEEEE! That’s why 
you ain’t got no teeth; your 
teeth ran away cause you 

talk 
so 
dang 

on much.” The 
room 
erupts 

with 
laughter 

and 
snickers 

from 
a 
group 

of 20 men, one 
woman and one 
child. 
Charlie 

is 
a 
frequent 

visitor 
to 
the 

Capuchin 
Soup 
Kitchen 

in 
Detroit; 

the 
staff 
and 

other Capuchin guests know his 
charismatic personality well. The 
checkered floor was worn with 
scuff marks, and the air smelled 
of the stir-fry served for lunch 
that day. As the laughter gently 
subsided, more visitors trickled 
into the doorway, awaiting the 
meal provided for them.

11 a.m.: The volunteers of 

Capuchin 
Soup 
Kitchen 
are 

diverse in gender, race and age. 
I went to volunteer with Circle 
K on its annual day of service. 
I was the only native Detroiter 
and the only Black person of the 
group. Before we began serving 
food, we were escorted to a room 
where we met one of the founders 
of the soup kitchen. He showed 
us a video about the history of 
Capuchin and its purpose — the 
soup kitchen has been in Detroit 
since 1929, at the beginning 
of the Great Depression when 
national poverty cloaked the 
United States.

Detroit was not immune to the 

social ills of the Great Depression. 
The friars of Capuchin Province 
of St. Joseph used their ministry 
on Mt. Elliott Street to feed those 
who needed a meal. Since its 
creation, Capuchin has expanded 
its programs to include substance 
abuse 
counseling, 
employment 

opportunities 
for 
people 
who 

were formerly incarcerated and 
an organic farm to redevelop 
Detroit’s food system. I chose to 
work with Capuchin this service 
day because I was familiar with 
Earthworks and the On the Rise 
Bakery, which are also Capuchin 
programs, but I wanted to learn 
more about the soup kitchen.

11:30 a.m.: At least a dozen 

guests have come through the 
lunch line since lunch began, 
some with faint smiles, others 
not making eye contact and a few 
with large grins. I ask each of 
them how they are, which seems 
like both the politest question to 
ask, but also the most trivial. For 
the brief 20-second interaction, 
how could I gauge their sense 
of well-being? Why would they 
care to share that information 
with 
me? 
The 
impersonal 

engagement of serving lunch 
made the physical lunch line 
that divided us more defined. I 
had hoped our commonalities 
as Black Detroiters would dilute 

the physical barrier of the lunch 
line that divided the privileged 
and the marginalized, but the 
systemic implications of classism 
were impossible to ignore. 

The video that the volunteers 

and I watched before our shift 
described how the need for 
soup 
kitchen 
in 
Mt. 
Elliott 

community arose. I had to think 
about 
insufficient 
access 
to 

food, poverty and homelessness 
that has plagued the Mt. Elliott 
community for decades, and how 
Capuchin is meeting a need that 
public policy has neglected. That 
video complicated my presence 
at Capuchin. I was able to insert 
myself into this space for a mere 
three hours and then resume my 
life. And the guests of Capuchin? 
Well, who knows? The soup 
kitchen and the volunteers for 
that meal are a small fraction of 
their day. We were supposed to 
be there to help, and yet I felt so 
helpless, because I knew I didn’t 
solve anything.

Of all the service learning 

organizations on campus, how 
many provoke a discussion about 
the roots of the systemic issues 
community-service acts as a Band-
Aid for? Or a reflection about how 
identity impacts the service we 
engage in and communities we 
seek to serve? What message does 
it send when one of the University’s 
premier 
service 
organizations, 

the Detroit Partnership, does not 
have one member from the city 
of Detroit on its executive board 
and the majority of its service 
opportunities 
are 
in 
Detroit? 

Without 
having 
a 
personal 

connection with a community, 
how can a person work with 
community 
members 
in 
an 

authentic manner that actually 
benefits the community?

If a person does not know the 

landscape of a community — 
familiarity with the work that 
is being done or the specific 
institutional barriers that allow 
for community service to exist — 
and a person’s privileges working 
with a community go unchecked, 
how 
can 
someone 
avoid 

participating 
in 
imperialistic 

charity work? How can you build 
sustainable models of service that 
foster a maintainable partnership 
with student and community-
led organizations? None of these 
things 
can 
happen 
without 

consistent, intentional reflection 
before and after the community-
service activity takes place.

A 
space 
for 
reflection 
is 

critical, especially when so many 
community service organizations 
at the University concentrate the 
majority of their work in Detroit. 
Engaging in service work in Detroit 
can be a learning experience for 
University of Michigan students, 
if done correctly. But even the 
thought of service being a learning 
experience privileges education 
on the plight of people who have 
been systematically franchised. 
Who is community service really 

benefiting then?

A 
number 
of 
community-

service organizations and social-
service agencies exist in the city 
of Detroit. University students 
can support the organizations 
that 
Detroiters 
have 
initiated 

themselves, 
rather 
than 

overlapping services. More often 
than not, service organizations at 
the University receive conflated 
attention 
in 
their 
efforts 
to 

“restore” 
Detroit, 
without 

acknowledging or uplifting the 
organizations 
already 
present 

in the Detroit community who 
sustain the work that community 
organizations involve themselves 
in for brief periods of time.

As Mama Hanifa Adjuman from 

the Detroit Black Community 
Food Security Network stated 
during a recent panel on food 
and racial justice, “What we 
welcome (are) allies; we (don’t) 
need 
white 
missionaries.” 

Students need to address their 
biases, privileges, perceptions 
and motivations before working 
with communities.

Presently at the University, 

it is far too easy for community 
service 
to 
become 
charity 

work, perpetuating systems of 
inequality instead of addressing 
or 
even 
acknowledging 
the 

roots 
of 
the 
problems. 
The 

Ginsberg Center is an example 
of an underutilized University 
resource that could alleviate 
problematic 
participation 
in 

service. 
My 
favorite 
aspect 

of 
Ginsberg 
is 
its 
monthly 

reflection sessions on engaging 
in service, and how that service 
intersects with social justice, 
social change and identity.

I 
would 
be 
in 
favor 
of 

mandating members of campus 
service 
organizations 
attend 

at least one of these sessions. 
The Ginsberg Center is the 
only 
space 
on 
campus 
that 

challenges students to reflect 
on their personal engagement 
with service, a great example 
of 
this 
being 
the 
center’s 

Check 
Yourself 
Community 

Engagement Checklist provides a 
fantastic framework for student 
organizations 
to 
structure 

service reflections.

Both communities in need 

and those providing a service 
can 
gain 
from 
community 

service 
in 
tangible 
ways 
if 

earnest reflection and genuine 
interaction 
are 
fostered. 
As 

active 
citizens 
and 
aspiring 

public servants, it is imperative 
that 
students 
interact 
with 

communities 
intentionally 
to 

gain civic mindfulness. When I 
return to work with Capuchin, 
I hope the volunteers and I can 
interact with Charlie and the 
other visitors of the soup kitchen 
in a way in which we equally 
contribute to and benefit from a 
meaningful service experience.

The 
Michigan 
House 

and Senate have drafted 
two separate packages of 
bills to deal with the long-
term prospects of Detroit 
schools. 
Both 
bills 
split 

the current district into 
two entities, DPS and the 
Detroit Community School 
District. But only the Senate 
bill 
reorganizes 
Detroit 

schools in a way that returns 
significant 
autonomy 
to 

the people of Detroit while 
still being cost effective. 
Voters should put pressure 
on their representatives to 
pass the Senate package 
because 
it 
has 
gained 

bipartisan 
support 
and 

provides 
DPS 
with 
a 

financially viable route to 
recovery 
that 
prioritizes 

needs of students. Under 
both packages, DPS would 
exist only as a fiscal agent 
dedicated 
to 
paying 
off 

debt. DCSD would be a new 
entity funded with federal, 
state and local money that 
assumes the same role that 
DPS has currently, only 
with a whole new structural 
organization. 

Under the Senate plan 

elections for a new school 
board 
would 
take 
place 

as soon as 2021. Until the 
election, 
though, 
there 

would be a seven-member 
school board of officials 
elected by Gov. Rick Snyder 
(R) and Mayor Mike Duggan 
(D). The current Financial 
Review Commission would 
oversee the debt of DPS, 
like the House bill proposes. 
In 
addition, 
a 
Detroit 

Education 
Commission 

would be created to appoint 
a chief education officer, 
both 
officials 
would 

coordinate 
community 

involvement in DCSD.

The 
Senate 
package 

not only offers the most 
benefit for the community 
of Detroit, including the 
schools, teachers, students 
and citizens, but also has 
bipartisan support as well 
as support from Snyder, 
Duggan and a number of 
organizations 
dedicated 

to 
education 
such 
as 

StudentsFirst MI, Coalition 
for the Future of Detroit 
Schoolchildren, 
Excellent 

Schools Detroit and AFT 
Michigan.

The House package, on 

the other hand, pushes 
too hard against educators 
and leaves the new school 
district in the hands of 
government-appointed 
personnel for too long to 
be considered beneficial to 
the Detroit school system. 
The bill would additionally 
end 
teachers’ 
rights 
to 

collective bargaining for 
anything other than pay 
and benefits. A financial 
review commission would 
oversee the paying off of 
debt from the old DPS and 
a new school board would 
be phased in, taking full 
control after eight years 
to 
oversee 
the 
actions 

of DCSD. In addition to 
curtailing teachers’ rights 
and 
keeping 
democracy 

from the citizens of Detroit, 
the House bill has not 
gained bipartisan support. 

The 
House 
bill 
also 

attempts to reform teacher 
and school evaluations in 
a manner that could be 
detrimental to the district. 
Teachers would be evaluated 
based on student test scores, 
giving 
each 
school 
an 

overall grade that would be 
available to parents. While 
the full details of such a 

rating plan have not been 
worked out as of yet, any 
method that significantly 
relies on student test scores 
as a means for evaluation 
does not do the students 
of Detroit justice. It is 
important that any plan 
measures 
a 
student’s 

success 
using 
a 
holistic 

perspective and not simply 
their test scores. Such a 
rating system would also 
not directly account for 
physical conditions, which 
were ignored in the previous 
mechanics 
of 
evaluating 

Detroit schools.

Though some people may 

believe 
that 
DPS 
should 

simply declare bankruptcy, 
doing so would place the 
burden of DPS’ debt on the 
state, which is already in a 
less than excellent financial 
state, and is therefore not a 
financially viable option. In 
addition to these challenges, 
the bankruptcy of DPS would 
likely not allow DCSD to 
enter into existence with a 
clean slate dedicated to the 
betterment of the education 
of Detroit students.

Among all the debate, it is 

also important to remember 
that swift action is necessary. 
It is likely that even with 
emergency funding DPS will 
run out of money by early 
the end of this school year, 
leaving 
47,000 
students 

without schools. The Senate 
plan is the right choice for 
now. But even if all plans run 
smoothly and DCSD comes 
to fruition in time to aid the 
students of Detroit, efforts 
will need to continue in order 
to ensure Detroit’s school 
system not only remains 
intact, 
but 
also 
delivers 

to students the education 
they’re entitled to.

the 

weekly updates. The meeting 
went on anyway, and, of course, 
I cried while reading through 
the weekly updates. The meeting 
ended, but nobody left. They sat 
with me; they wanted to know 
more, learn more and do more. 
When I did go home, I received 
an influx of texts, e-mails, 
Google invites for coffee dates, 
offers to just sit with me quietly 
— all from my optiMize family.

You don’t find that in many 

places — that selflessness. It’s 
difficult to find a community 
of people who are determined 
to make a difference, no matter 
how simple or seemingly small 
that difference may be. The 
optiMize community shares one 
collective purpose: to make the 

world a better place. It doesn’t 
matter 
if 
you’re 
supporting 

someone in their time of need 
or 
doing 
groundbreaking 

entrepreneurship 
work. 

Everything optiMize stands for 
can be seen in the daily actions 
of our community members. The 
love, understanding, empathy 
and support that was shown to 
me on that day may have seemed 
amplified at that moment, but 
this was not a singular moment. 
This 
was 
optiMize. 
Those 

intangible, 
positive 
elements 

that resonate from the actions 
of everyone in the community 
are what will drive change in 
this world.

The 
central 
mission 
of 

optiMize is to create positive 
action by replacing the phrase, 
“Somebody should do something 
about that,” with “Why not me?”

The 
teams 
in 
our 
Social 

Innovation 
Challenge 
have 

fused their intangible, positive 
elements 
with 
optiMize’s 

mission to inspire the impact 
we want to see. We have a team 
combatting 
Islamophobia 
by 

creating 
thought-provoking 

artwork, 
while 
another 
is 

creating virtual reality games 
for children with disabilities 
and another is working with 
Kenyan farmers to create a 
sustainable fish feed. And that’s 
just the beginning. Members 

of the optiMize community are 
building their ideas from the 
ground up, and from the ground 
up they are aiding in making 
this 
world 
more 
just, 
more 

sustainable and just plain better.

For me, optiMize has served 

as an active reminder to seek out 
change wherever change may 
be necessary. It’s a contagious 
environment — you discover 
optiMize, you meet inspiring 
people who embrace the ability 
to question and transform, and 
then, without hesitation, you 
begin. That’s all it takes — just 
ask yourself, “Why not me?”

The 
optiMize 
Social 

Innovation 
Challenge 
Final 

Showcase is on April 13 from 
6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre

will 
feature 
10 
teams 
from 

optiMize’s 2016 Challenge, a 
seven-month-long

that comprises workshops and 
mentorship 
opportunities, 

allowing hundreds of students to 
turn their ideas for social change 
into reality. optiMize awards 
more than $150,000 in funding 
and 
summer

A new start for Detroit schools
O

ver the years of Detroit’s economic decline, the Detroit Public 
School system has suffered immensely. Since 2003-2004, 
enrollment in DPS has declined by 200,000 students. In addition, 

the district has accumulated $1.5 billion in debt that has hindered its 
ability to remain a safe and functional learning environment. Over the 
past couple of months, teachers in DPS have successfully gained increased 
media attention for their “sick-outs” in protest of the horrible conditions 
in many Detroit schools, which has prompted political officials to take 
notice as well. DPS was on schedule to run out of money by April of this 
year when the legislature passed emergency funding to keep the schools 
open through the end of the school year.

More than a game for Halle Wangler

Senior leaves 
Michigan with 

few statistics but a 

major impact

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Editor

In three years, Halle Wangler 

has played just 20 minutes while 
donning a Michigan uniform, but 
she’s content with that.

In 18 games, the fifth-year 

senior guard has scored only one 
basket for the Wolverines, but that 
doesn’t matter to her. She wouldn’t 
want to be remembered for how 
many points she scored anyway.

What matters to her is being 

remembered for how she made 
people feel.

“I’m a very loud and energetic 

person,” Wangler said. “That 
kind of shows (other players) that 
it’s not just work. It’s just having 
enthusiasm, love and passion that 
you show through your work ethic 
or just being on the court and what 
you do.”

The road to Michigan was by no 

means an easy one for Wangler. But 
for her, basketball is therapeutic. It 
has always been an outlet for her to 
escape daily life, and having that 
opportunity with the Wolverines is 
one she has dreamt of as long as she 
can remember.

Michigan has rooted itself 

deeply into the Wangler family for 
the past half-century, and it’s why 
Halle felt like it was the right place 
to be. Her father, John, played 
quarterback from 1976 to 1980, 
and now her brothers play under 
that same banner.

While her father and brothers 

are bound to the gridiron, Halle 
found a place of her own — the 
hardwood of Crisler Center. It 
was almost by a stroke of luck 
that Wangler ended up playing 
at Michigan under fourth-year 
coach Kim Barnes Arico, but luck 
doesn’t explain it all.

* * *

If football in Ann Arbor is a 

religion, Wangler never skipped 
church. As a kid, the Royal Oak, 
Mich., native always went to 
games with her family, and John’s 
connections 
to 
the 
program 

allowed his daughter to meet his 
former teammates at the alumni 
tent outside the Big House.

Wangler also met her father’s 

former coach, Bo Schembechler, 
who held her at football games 
and regularly spoke with the 
Wangler family.

At home, Halle’s grandparents 

went “the whole nine yards” and 
have decked out their Christmas 
tree in maize and blue since the 
’70s. According to John, they truly 
“force-fed” the Michigan tradition 
to the Wangler children.

“Growing up, it surrounds you,” 

Halle said. “It becomes a part of 
who you are.”

Oddly enough, though, Wangler 

had the Michigan State bug up 
until her early teens.

In her green and white phase, 

Wangler had a signed photo of 
Michigan State men’s basketball 
coach Tom Izzo as well as an 
autographed basketball in her 
room. By chance, she played for 
an AAU team called the Spartans 
alongside current Michigan State 
forward Aerial Powers.

Eventually, Wangler came to 

the conclusion that Michigan was 
where she was meant to be. In a 
household built around the block 
‘M’, it was almost inevitable.

“It was a battle, a tug of war for 

her affections,” John said. “In the 
end, she came to her senses.”

* * *

John Wangler never wanted 

to push his kids into athletics. 
If they gravitated toward them, 
he’d do everything in his power 
to help them be successful. But at 
the end of the day, he just wanted 
them to do whatever they were 
passionate about.

Jack and Jared ultimately picked 

football and now have spots on the 
Michigan roster as a wide receiver 
and linebacker, respectively. Sierra 
is now a freshman at the University, 
but isn’t involved in collegiate 
athletics.

For Halle, having a basketball in 

her hands just felt right.

“There’s nothing worse than if 

your parent wants it more than the 
child does,” John said. “That was 
never the case. I’m happy with my 
career and enjoyed every second 
of it. I don’t have to live through 
my kids.”

According to John, “genes and 

ability can only take you so far” 
in athletics. To him, the number 
one thing he needed to instill 
in his kids was a work ethic. If 
the four Wanglers could put the 
time in and be willing to work at 
something, they were going to be 
great at it. 

Once a Michigan quarterback 

under Schembechler, John knew 
exactly what it took to be great.

After John worked his way 

to the top of Michigan’s depth 
chart, future NFL Hall of Famer 
Lawrence Taylor sacked him in 
the 1979 Gator Bowl, rupturing 
two cross ligaments in his knee 
and sending him on a long journey 
toward recovery.

John returned for a fifth year 

once his knee healed, but being 
less than 100 percent made him 
so frustrated that he considered 
quitting the team. At one practice, 
he 
wasn’t 
playing 
well 
and 

Schembechler told him he was 
the “dumbest quarterback in the 
history of intercollegiate football,” 
to which John replied, “That’s a 
long time, coach.”

Given 
John’s 
arduous 

recovery, 
Schembechler 

knew 
the 
worst 
possible 

punishment and kicked him out 
of practice. But that, coupled 
with a major tongue-lashing in 
Schembechler’s office the next 
day, didn’t stop Wangler from 
fighting his way back to the top.

That year, the top was leading 

Michigan to a 1981 Rose Bowl 
victory in Pasadena, Calif. 

Twenty-five years later, when 

Halle — then a seventh grader 
— had a bad game, she didn’t 
get a “good job” from her father. 
Instead, he cut right to the chase.

“You’ll be an average player,” 

John told her, the same way 
Schembechler would have told 
him.

“Average” wasn’t in her father’s 

vocabulary, 
which 
made 
the 

comment even more hurtful. But 
Halle knew she didn’t want to be 
average. She didn’t want her dad 
to utter the word again.

That night, Halle went to the 

backyard and started dribbling.

“If you hang in there, do what 

you’re supposed do, you keep your 
nose down and you stay focused,” 
John said, “somehow you end 
up coming out on top and end up 
coming out of the pack.

“It’s not some crazy theory or 

philosophy. It’s kind of a way of 
life.”

Whether 
it 
was 
a 
crazy 

philosophy or not, it was exactly 
what his daughter needed to hear 
years later when she considered 
quitting basketball.

* * *

During Wangler’s freshman 

year of high school, her mom 
passed away.

“That had a very, very hard 

impact on the kids,” John said. 
“That’s a tough thing that no one 
should have to deal with, and (my 
kids have) come through it and 
battled through it. There’s always 

setbacks. Everybody gets knocked 
down, and it’s how you get back 
up. That’s how you’re judged.”

For an overwhelmed Halle, 

throwing in the towel on basketball 
seemed like a highly viable option. 
Her 
father 

thought 
differently.

He told her 

she needed to 
feel it out for 
one more game. 
If she gave it 
her best effort 
and played like 
it was her last 
game, she could 
make a decision.

In that one game, Wangler had 

a good enough performance to 
realize basketball was something 
she needed. She couldn’t afford to 
give it up.

“I forgot about all the stuff 

that was going on at home and 
elsewhere,” Wangler said. “My 
freshman year is when I realized 
I can overcome anything that’s 
thrown my way.

“Basketball was more than just 

a sport. It was therapeutic for 
me. It was my thing, (and) it has 
helped me get through a lot, too.”

In high school at Royal Oak 

Shrine, 
Wangler 
attended 

both the boys and girls’ varsity 

basketball 
practices. 
Outside regular 
practice hours, 
John or Shrine 
women’s 
basketball 
coach 
Bill 

LeGault would 
open 
up 
the 

gym 
for 
her 

whenever 
she 

wanted. Early in the morning or 
late at night, Wangler dribbled 
alone in a dedication to prove her 
internal strength. Even at home, 
she’d play pick-up games against 
her brothers. 

John 
saw 
his 
daughter 

was 
obsessed 
with 
getting 

better, obsessed with proving 
herself. For Halle, that meant 
playing collegiate basketball — 
something that wasn’t average.

“She 
threw 
herself 
into 

basketball,” John said. “Even 
when her mother passed, I think 
that was her outlet. She really 
put herself into it, and that really 
was what took her mind off all 
the hardship. I think it really was 
a outlet for her and a release.”

During 
her 
early 
years, 

Wangler recalled conversations 
she 
had 
with 
Schembechler 

as well as the stories she has 
heard about Michigan’s revered 
coach through her father. One of 
Schembechler’s teachings stood 
out the most: perseverance. 

“(Bo) really knew how to push 

you to the point where you didn’t 
think you’d make it, but then you 
made it and became great,” Halle 
said. “Perseverance is something 
that my dad learned from Bo, 
because at one point, he didn’t 
even think he was going to be 
able to play football ever again.”

Wangler 
didn’t 
think 
she 

would play basketball either, 
but in her junior year at Shrine, 
she was offered a basketball 
scholarship 
from 
Oakland 

University. She accepted right 
away and headed to Oakland in 

the fall of 2011.

It wasn’t Michigan, but she 

didn’t want to experience life 
without basketball.

* * *

In 
June 
2013, 
Oakland 

women’s basketball coach Beckie 
Francis was fired. A month later, 
the Detroit Free Press released a 
report in which 15 former players 
stated Francis had “fixated on 
their weights … pushed her 
religious beliefs … (and) engaged 
in intimidation and emotional 
abuse.” 
With 
the 
program 

shrouded in controversy, Wangler 
decided it was time to transfer.

Wangler had worked hard to 

make it to the collegiate level, 
and that progress was at stake. 
The first obvious choice was 
Michigan, 
which 
combined 

academics, 
basketball 
and 

family tradition all into one. The 
Wolverines didn’t take many 
walk-ons, so her father called 
in a favor to Michigan men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein, 
whose son Mark had previously 
worked for him.

Beilein briefed Barnes Arico 

on what Michigan meant to 
the Wanglers, and what the 
Wanglers meant to Michigan. 
It was a shot in the dark for 
Halle, but when Barnes Arico 
finally met her, she knew she had 
discovered something unique.

“The 
minute 
I 
had 
an 

opportunity to meet Halle, I 
knew that I wanted her on our 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “Her 
enthusiasm, her passion, her zest 
for life was something I wanted 
our team to be around.”

Added Wangler: “I feel like 

God puts you where you’re meant 
to be at certain times in your life. 
I think that my time in Oakland 
was supposed to be then, and 
then he put me here.”

The first week of Michigan 

practice was excruciating for 
Wangler, and all she could do 
was laugh.

Oakland’s conditioning didn’t 

nearly compare to Michigan’s. 
From day one, the reality set in: 
Welcome to the Big Ten.

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

Senior Halle Wangler has played sparingly since transferring from Oakland, but she’ll leave a legacy in the women’s basketball program with the character she showed.

“I forgot about all 
the stuff that was 
going on at home 
and elsewhere.”

Sheppard starts on new path

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

Four 
years 
ago, 
Austin 

Sheppard stepped onto Michigan’s 
campus as a freshman majoring in 
movement science, hell-bent on 
becoming an orthopedic surgeon.

Even in high school, Sheppard 

knew she wanted to pursue a 
degree in the medical field — but 
had no idea where she wanted 
to go to college. Originally from 
Murphy, Texas, Sheppard was 
a 
well-accomplished 
gymnast 

as a sophomore at Plano East 
High 
School. 
She 
garnered 

three prominent finishes at the 
2010 Junior Olympic National 
Championships, placing second 
on floor, third on vault and 
seventh in the all-around.

And with a record like that, she 

caught the eye of Michigan.

The 
Wolverines 
started 

recruiting 
Sheppard 
her 

sophomore year. After a little 
encouragement from her mother 
to check the school out, she 
decided she wanted to pursue a 
higher education at Michigan. 
Sheppard committed her junior 
year of high school, ready to get 
going when she walked on campus 
as a freshman. 

Now, after four years and 

one change in career plans, 
Sheppard not only has maintained 
her reputation as a successful 
gymnast, 
but 
also 
hasn’t 

abandoned her determination to 
work in the medical field. With 
such a long-term commitment 
required to become a doctor, 
Sheppard made the decision to 
switch her goals to nursing.

“I wanted to major in movement 

science because I wanted to be an 
orthopedic surgeon,” Sheppard 
said. “But then when I got here, I 
realized how much of a demand 
for school that was and how much 
athletics would be on top of that. 
For me, I just figured it wasn’t the 
route I wanted to go. I still want 
to do something in medicine, 
though. I want to go into nursing.”

Balancing a pre-med track 

and Big Ten athletics certainly 

hasn’t been easy, but Sheppard 
has managed to do it with great 
success.

Despite being sidelined the 

end of her sophomore year due to 
injury and being limited to two 
events, Sheppard was recently 
named to the All-Big Ten first 
team for the second time in her 
career. She was also on the All-
Big Ten Championships Team 
in 2014 and recently received 
Academic All-Big Ten honors for 
the third time in her career — a 
clear indication that she is pairing 
her education and her success in 
gymnastics.

“I’ve always had a passion for 

how the body works,” Sheppard 
said. “Being a gymnast, I’ve had a 
lot of injuries and I’ve been around 
a lot doctors. I like seeing people 
succeed after being hurt or sick, 
and I’ve just always had a passion 
for it, which is why I decided to 
become a health and fitness major.”

Not 
only 
is 
Sheppard 

dominating in the gym, but she 
is also projected to be one of the 
first 
four 
student-athletes 
to 

graduate from Michigan with a 
degree in health and fitness. The 
degree is fairly new to the School 
of Kinesiology (around 2013), 
and combines a wide range of 
topics like sport management and 
anatomy and physiology.

While 
Sheppard 
plans 
to 

apply to nursing school after 
she graduates to continue on 
her medical path, the degree is 
flexible since it has a foot in both 
science and business.

“You get the best of both 

worlds,” 
Sheppard 
said. 
“If 

someone were to go the athletic 
director route, this would be 
really great for that because you 
have a bunch of history behind 
sports and you also learn about 
the marketing and ethics side of 
business. It’s also good for if you 
want to be a personal trainer or a 
strength and conditioning coach.”

And while neither of these 

career paths apply to Sheppard, 
she’s positive that she’s picked 
the 
right 
major. 
With 
the 

program 
offering 
real-life 

learning opportunities through 
classes and programs, Sheppard 
has been able to shadow in the 
midwife section at the University 
of Michigan Hospital.

She said she enjoyed her time 

shadowing at the hospital, but 
Sheppard really lit up when talking 
about her experience working 
with children with disabilities at 
Ann Arbor Pioneer High School.

“I took a pediatric disabilities 

class, so we learned all about 
a bunch of disabilities with 
children and just people in 
general,” Sheppard said. “One 
of the assignments was that 
we had to volunteer at the high 
school or a sporting event with 
kids with disabilities. I learned 
so much about them and I also 
learned a lot about myself. I just 
really appreciated them because 
they were so committed and 
determined.”

With her gymnastics career 

winding down and her medical 
career 
just 
getting 
started, 

Sheppard has worked hard at 
combining both aspects of her life 
to make her Michigan experience 
as beneficial as possible. On one 

hand, her degree has enabled her 
with all of the right experiences to 
continue with her education.

On the other hand, her final 

NCAA Regional Tournament as 
a Wolverine is this weekend, and 
she couldn’t be more focused on 
contributing everything she has to 
her team. Anyone on the sidelines 
might believe that Sheppard’s life 
in the classroom is separate from 
her life in the gym.

But for Sheppard, they’re both 

connected.

“The four years I’ve been here, 

there’s been people that come 
and go because they graduate,” 
Sheppard said. “You have to learn 
how to work with them and bond 
with them, and it’s made me a 
better person to be able to work 
with a team, because that’s really 
important for a nurse to be able to 
do that.”

Sheppard has left her mark on 

Michigan history, in the gym and 
in the classroom. Now, equipped 
with the qualities she has learned 
from her team and from her 
education, she will seek to match 
that success in whatever realm 
the future may hold for her.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan set for 
WNIT semifinal

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

Throughout the WNIT, the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team has gotten a lift from the 
support of its fans. Each of the 
team’s first four 
tournament 
games 
have 

been 
played 

at 
Crisler 

Center, 
and 

the Wolverines 
have won three 
of those games 
by 20 or more 
points.

Thursday, 

the Wolverines 
will take their 
high-powered 
offense on the 
road, looking to advance to the 
WNIT championship game with 
a win over Florida Gulf Coast (32-
5). Michigan (22-13) reached the 
semifinals last year as well, but 
the Wolverines fell short, losing 
to UCLA, 69-65.

“We’re 
very 
well-rested 

compared to a lot of other teams,” 
Flaherty said. “We’ve (gotten) to 
stay at home. We’ve (gotten) to 
practice here. I think that’s a huge 
advantage. We have to bring our 
intensity there, our tenacity there.”

The game in Fort Myers, Fla., 

will be a battle of strengths. 
Michigan comes into the game 
averaging 79.1 points, while the 
Eagles limit their opponents to an 
average of just 49.1 points behind 
guard Whitney Knight’s 61 steals 
and 87 blocks on the season.

Offensively, Florida Gulf Coast 

is led by guards Kaneisha Atwater 
and Knight, who average 14.2 and 
13.4 points per game, respectively.

Madison 
Ristovski, 

Katelynn 
Flaherty, 
Hallie 

Thome and Siera Thompson 
are all averaging double-digit 
scoring for the Wolverines this 
postseason, and teams haven’t 

had an answer for Michigan’s 
variety of scoring threats.

Despite its offensive success, 

Michigan may run into a matchup 
problem against the Eagles, who 
are 18-3 at home this season.

“They’re a great team at home,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico after Monday’s game. “They 
play five guards. It’s going to be 
really tough for (Thome) to play. But 
it was a similar matchup tonight. 
She had a really hard matchup. 
They shoot the 3 like crazy, so it’s a 
different kind of style.”

Though Knight is listed at 

6-foot-3 and is the tallest player 
on the Florida Gulf Coast roster 
by four inches, she plays on the 
perimeter. Beyond Knight, the 
Eagles have no players taller than 
5-foot-11. Thome would likely 
have an advantageous matchup 
on the offensive end and in the 
rebounding department, but she 
will struggle with the Eagles’ 
quickness when defending.

Thome 
heads 
into 
the 

semifinal contest just four points 
away from becoming the second 
freshman in program history to 
score 500 points in a season, and 
her performance will be a key for 
the Wolverines.

Michigan 
is 
heading 
into 

Thursday’s game riding a wave 
of momentum off a come-from-
behind victory over Temple in the 
WNIT quarterfinals. After falling 
behind by 15 in the first quarter, the 
Wolverines mounted a second-half 
push led by Ristovski and Flaherty 
and held on for the 77-76 win.

The 
tournament 
run 
for 

Florida Gulf Coast has also 
come entirely in front of a home 
crowd. The Eagles have won 
each of their four WNIT games 
by double digits, and took down 
Hofstra, 61-46, Monday in their 
quarterfinal matchup.

If Michigan wants a chance to 

finally bring a banner to Crisler 
Center, the road goes through 
hostile territory.

EPISODE REVIEW

On the heels of “Batman v 

Superman: Dawn of Justice,” 
CBS’s “Supergirl” is surging 
ahead in ratings with its 
own take on the superhero 
crossover 
genre. 
Breaking 
through 
network 
walls, The 
CW teams up 
with CBS to 
bring Barry 
Allen (Grant 
Gustin, 
“Glee”) into 
National City 
with a running start. Over 
the past season, “Supergirl” 
and “The Flash” have been 
relatively successful among 
the millennial fanbase. The 
newest episode of “Supergirl,” 
“World’s Finest,” earned a 
21-percent overall rise in 
viewers, though the fate 
of “Supergirl” is yet to be 

revealed.

Over the two-season run 

of “The Flash,” we’ve been 
privy to two crossover events 
with The CW’s prodigal 
son, “Arrow.” These team-
ups, much like “Batman v 
Superman,” brought the 
violence, while “World’s 
Finest” is all lollipops and 
rainbows — a well-overdue 
break from the violence 
surrounding the DC Comics 
community as of late. The 
episode explores the “theory 
of the multiverse,” one of 
DC’s most popular and 
attentive elements that has 
only recently been touched 
on in “The Flash.” Although 
they (literally) come from 
different universes, Barry 
and Kara (Melissa Benoist, 
“Glee”) easily find a rhythm, 
eventually working together, 
as opposed to the usual hero-
sidekick dynamic, even if 
Barry does unintentionally 

play wingman for a while.

The transformation of 

Siobhan Smythe (Italia Ricci, 
“Chasing Life”) into the Silver 
Banshee, a moment that might 
have been epic, is slightly 
undermined by the Flash’s 
unexpected arrival, and it may 
have been more effective in 
a later episode. But you can’t 
argue with the offbeat humor 
that accompanies Barry to this 
Earth. Along with the fact that 
he brought ice cream.

Looking at the episode as 

a whole, “World’s Finest” 
is an exposé of everything 
that separates the worlds of 
“Supergirl” and “The Flash” 
from DC’s darker corners. 
Adding in the wonderfully 
adorable and singular 
chemistry between Gustin 
and Benoist, this episode has 
bumped “Batman v Superman” 
and “Flash vs. Arrow” straight 
to the curbs of Gotham.

Episode 18 

Mondays

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

In the exclusive circles of the 

art world, Peggy Guggenheim is 
infamous. 
A patron 
for some of 
the most 
accom-
plished art-
ists of the 
20th centu-
ry, today she 
is known 
for her 
adventurous 
sex life and 
her lifelong 
devotion to 
modern art before it was cool.

But “Peggy Guggenheim: Art 

Addict” describes, in no uncer-
tain terms, the person behind 
the heiress to the Guggenheim 
fortune. Director Lisa Immordino 
Vreeland, granddaughter-in-law 
of Diana Vreeland, dives as deep 
as she can into the intricacies and 
eccentricities of Guggenheim’s 
life. However, when dealing with 
a subject as insecure and, frankly, 
strange as Guggenheim, it is 
impossible to get what feels like 
the full story. 

Framed around the audio 

recordings of an interview with 
Guggenheim herself during the 
last year of her life in 1979, the film 
allows her to speak for herself. But 
I couldn’t imagine a woman like 
Guggenheim would let anyone 
else talk for her. Describing her-
self as both a nymphomaniac and 
an art addict, she name drops her 
various cliques of lovers and art-
ists with casual ease and humor. 
The talking heads, including 
surprising figures such as Robert 

De Niro and art critic John Rich-
ardson, only add to this carefully 
drawn portrait of Guggenheim.

Told in chronological order 

and divided into the different 
emotional passages of her life, the 
film describes how Guggenheim 
has always been “the wayward 
Guggenheim” — the black sheep of 
a prestigious family that was the 
equivalent of American nobility. 
After her father died going down 
in the Titanic, she was left with 
450,000 dollars. While this may 
seem substantial for a teenager, it 
was a meager allowance for a Gug-
genheim.

She moved to Paris and opened 

her first gallery on a whim, decid-
ing that a gallery would be less 
expensive than a publishing 
company. In the very nonchalant 
way to which the viewer must 
very quickly adjust, Guggenheim 
affirms that she couldn’t have 
opened the gallery if her (mother) 
hadn’t died. Though Guggenheim 
routinely discusses incredibly sad 
topics in the film, including the 
suicide of her daughter, her multi-
ple divorces and the botched nose 
job that led to her lifelong insecu-
rity in her appearance, she never 
quite varies from the same posh 
voice with which she addresses 
everything.

Guggenheim was revolutionary 

in so many ways. After opening 
her gallery in Paris right before 
World War II broke out and Hitler 
invaded France, she waited until 
the last second to move back to 
America to continue her work. 
There’s a fantastic line when 
her interviewer asks her, “You 
realize you could have been sent 
to a concentration camp?” and 
she responds, “Of course!” in 
her offhand and erratic manner. 

Guggenheim is all at once naïve 
and sophisticated, intimidatingly 
smart and alarmingly foolish. 
She’s described as not particularly 
beautiful, but incredibly charis-
matic and sexual. We see this in 
every portrait of her and every 
word that she says — she’s an 
alluring compilation of contradic-
tions, impossible to tear our ears 
and eyes from. 

After the Nazi invasion, she 

opened a gallery in New York 
called Art of This Century. It was 
here that she became truly known 
in the U.S. for her avant-garde 
lifestyle and artistic choices. She 
opened the exhibit 31 Women, 
one of the only spaces for female 
expression in the patriarchal art 
world. After tiring of New York, 
she moved to Venice, and her 
home-turned-art-museum has 
since become one of the world’s 
most popular spaces for modern 
art.

Watching the film feels like 

opening a scrapbook. The lively 
colors of the b-roll under the audio 
of Guggenheim’s interview are 
reminiscent of the art that she 
worked so hard to present. The 
opening titles are splattered with 
Pollack-esque paint, and the rest 
of the film seems like a collage 
pasted together by a modern artist 
that we should know, but don’t.

The film inspired so many 

questions in me. It made me want 
to learn about the artists that Gug-
genheim loved and was loved by; 
it made me want to ask about the 
types of art that people are mak-
ing right now, the kind that would 
excite the artists I’d just learned 
about. But one question really 
stuck with me as I walked out 
of the theater: am I in love with 
Peggy Guggenheim?

Peggy: Art addict

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Numb and raw, a single 

thought consumed me as Thurs-
day night’s premiere of “Sisters 
in Law” came 
to an end: I 
just wasted 
45 minutes of 
my life that I 
would never 
get back.

The premise 

of the show 
has some 
potential; it 
documents the 
careers of five 
Black, female attorneys in Hous-
ton as they navigate through their 
professional field. A look into the 
lives of high-powered, minority 
women kicking ass in a well-
respected profession would be a 
welcome addition to television, 
a positive change of pace from 
the usual mudslinging. Instead, 
WE TV created a series follow-
ing the “Sisters” as they “juggle 
their families, busy careers, and 
even more demanding social cal-
endars.” It becomes clear that the 
central struggle of the episode 
is how much food to order for a 
socialite fundraiser — and with 
that, it’s obvious that the show 
will make no real attempt to 

explore the world’s injustices.

The series’ attempt at a clever 

title is the only true reference to 
the law at all. Perhaps it’s because 
disclosing confidential attorney-
client information is illegal. Still, 
instead of discussing their legal 
practices or firms, the women 
spend the majority of their screen 
time dissecting their love-hate 
relationships with each other. 
However successful these women 
might be in their off-camera lives, 
their portrayal on screen is that 
of little intelligence, egotism and 
insincerity, completely eradicat-
ing any hope of a feminist por-
trayal of working professionals.

Since the premiere has virtu-

ally no insight into the legal sys-
tem, the episode instead revolves 
around the backstabbing and 
finger-pointing that seems to 
be the foundation of all reality 
television. In fact, the series was 
filmed, produced and packaged 
exactly like an episode of “The 
Real Housewives.” It even has 
that awkward intro when each 
women smiles seductively at the 
camera as she shifts her weight 
from one stiletto to the other 
beside a block-letter projection 
of her name. From the artificial 
elevator music added to footage 
of individual interviews to the 
heavy hand of the producers’ 
editing, piecing together seg-

ments of conversations for dra-
matic effect, “Sister in Law” is 
significantly less entertaining and 
more depressing than most real-
ity TV. Which is saying a lot.

At the episode’s climactic fun-

draiser, the group explodes into 
an emotionally assaulting debate 
on whether Abraham Lincoln 
was a Republican. One of the 
“Sisters” astutely noted, “It’s get-
ting really ratchet.” Yes. Yes it is.

Enough with the catfighting, 

people! I don’t care if Jolanda 
is living proof that, “You can 
take the girl out of the hood, 
but you can’t take the hood out 
of the girl.” It’s about time that 
women stop ripping each other 
apart for entertaining television 
and stepping on each others’ 
backs to get ahead. Women who 
break through the glass ceiling 
shouldn’t be stabbing each other 
with the fallout of glass shards.

Watching “Sisters in Law” 

was a life-changing experience. 
I might have enjoyed the occa-
sional episode of “Dance Moms” 
or “Keeping Up With the Kar-
dashians,” relishing in the escap-
ism of a world filled with drama 
that I will never actually get to 
see. But on the Thursday night 
that I watched “Sisters in Law,” I 
made a vow to never watch real-
ity television again. I’ve wasted 
too much time already. 

Worst ‘Sisters’ ever

TV REVIEW

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Last Friday night at the Popu-

lux in Detroit, I waited in line 
behind Yung Lean to order pizza. 
Just like in his videos, he ordered 
iced tea in a thick Swedish accent, 
yet no one identified him besides 
a handful of kids in obviously 
fake Japanese streetwear. You’d 
think the turquoise hair would be 
a dead giveaway. He was under-
standably brief with everyone, 
but I managed to sneak in a quick 
dap and told him I looked for-
ward to the show. The whole “Sad 
Boys” label is particularly hilari-
ous after seeing them quietly 
avoid eye contact while eating 
pizza in Detroit.

Sometimes it’s easy to forget 

that Yung Lean is only 19 years 
old. He’s been in the public eye 
for so long, and undergone so 
many bizarre phases, that he’s 
now expected to communicate 
some sort of adulthood. When he 
burst onto the scene, it was his 
Nordic interpretation of West-
ern hip-hop culture that caught 
everyone’s attention. His videos 
featured all of the choreography 
and movement of Chicago drill 
rap, but with white kids in Nike 
tech fleece. I can’t help but feel 
that their early obsession with 
Arizona Iced Tea had as much to 
do with the word “Arizona” as 
the vaporwave color palette on 
the cans.

Aging well was always going to 

be a test for him, though — how 
would he transition from kitschy 
nostalgia to making music that 
was actually about him? At what 
point would the N64 references 
go away? What does he actually 
have to say, anyway? I entered 

the show almost certain that 
Yung Lean himself had basically 
expired.

Before his set, fans were 

treated to an hour of indiscern-
ible wailing from Thaiboy Goon. 
While the performance was 
largely forgettable, I admired his 
willingness to keep going when 
not a single person in the audi-
ence knew the words. One of my 
favorite parts of the entire show 
was when Thaiboy brought out 
Bladee, who wore an oversized 
Chucky shirt that went down 
to his knees. He kept doing this 
thing where he put his hands up 
to his temples and his eyes would 
roll into the back of his head. He 
might’ve been singing in Swed-
ish for most of his set and no one 
would’ve known. I don’t know 
how much of this is for show, and 
how much is for real; they might 
actually just be this weird.

After the official Sad Boys 

Weed Carriers™ finished their 
set, Yung Lean himself stormed 
the stage performing “Hoover.” 
All hell broke loose. I’ve been to 
some rowdy shows, but never 
have I been shoved into a sub-
woofer that the actual artist was 
performing on top of. There was 
a ten-minute period where my 
sole focus was just finding a way 
to stand upright. With my palms 
pushing back on the stage, and 
the force of ten dudes in Thrasher 
hoodies pressed against my back, 
I couldn’t help but wonder what 
GG Allin shows might have been 
like. People were being dragged 
out of the crowd left and right; 
there were actual screams of pain 
flying around the stage. Lean 
chuckled and said, “This is one of 
the craziest shows we’ve had. I 
love Detroit.”

The front row was a circus 

act about as entertaining as the 
show itself. A guy in a tie-dye 
hoodie turned to me and said in 
a deadpan drawl, “I’m on 12 hits 
of acid right now,” and he wasn’t 
smiling. A girl in a t-shirt covered 
in frownie faces reached as far 
as possible, yelling “Please Yung 
Lean! Just one touch!” There was 
a guy in a Windows ’95 sweater. 
I couldn’t make this shit up if I 
tried.

I noticed that Lean had a more 

noticeably punk sound when 
performing his newest album, 
Warlord. He’s definitely trying 
to transition into some sort of 
Scandinavian rockstar, but as a 
teenager who still watches Chief 
Keef videos. Like child actors 
who often get typecast into roles 
before they establish an identity, 
Lean’s fans have come to expect 
more of his early meme-rap.

With that said, the crowd was 

obviously more excited to hear 
Lean’s older and more playful 
work. Less than four years old, 
“Ginseng Strip 2002” already 
feels like an Internet-rap staple. 
Everyone in the audience prob-
ably remembered where they 
were when they heard it for the 
first time. “Kyoto” had the entire 
crowd jumping and rapping in 
unison, though you could tell 
Lean has largely moved on from 
the faux-Japanese influence on 
his music.

When it was all over, the 

crowd slowly dispersed out of 
the Populux, mostly limping. As I 
reached the exit, a tattered can of 
Arizona Iced Tea caught my eye. 
A small crowd quickly assembled 
around it to take pictures of the 
symbolic remnants, probably to 
post on Tumblr or something.

Lean likes pizza, too

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

If living in a world where YG 

makes a diss track about (serious) 
presidential candidate Donald 
Trump is 
wrong, I 
don’t want 
to be right. 
Nothing 
about any of 
this would 
seem realistic 
in any ratio-
nal realm of 
the imagination, yet here we are, 
on March 30, 2016, and this is a 
thing that happened.

It’s a thing that doesn’t totally 

suck. Both YG and fellow Los 
Angeles rapper Nipsey Hussle 
come in hot after an opening 
snippet from black Valdosta State 
University students who were 
removed from a Trump rally Feb. 
29, and drop F bombs galore on 

Trump. They ridicule his plan 
to build a Mexican-funded wall 
separating Mexico and the U.S., 
with Nip pleading “It wouldn’t 
be the U.S.A without Mexicans 
/ And if it’s time to team up, shit, 
let’s begin / Black love, brown 
pride in the sets again / White 
people feel the same as my next 
to kin.” They find a way to reach 
their audience, whether the audi-
ence wants to take them seri-
ously or not.

The only major perplexity of 

the song is due to its production. 
The beat is eerily similar to that 
of “Twist My Fingaz,” a July 
2015 single teasing his second 
studio album, in addition to a lot 
of YG’s other work. The funky 
bass, the playful drum machine, 
even the hints of piano—they’re 
all there. YG’s sound is super 
West Coast, but it seems lazy to 

rely on nearly the exact same 
sound for two distinctively dif-
ferent songs.

It still goes, though; YG con-

tinues to be one of the easiest 
rappers to listen to, and more 
importantly, beyond the generic 
production are eloquently stated 
pleas campaigning for the good 
of this country (“I’m from a place 
where you prolly can’t go / Spea-
kin’ for some people that you 
prolly ain’t know”).

The rappers aren’t alone in 

hoping what they describe as 
a “Comedy Central-ass n---a” 
doesn’t lead the country. Their 
attempt to make sure everybody 
knows this is a valiant one, if 
anything, and they manage to 
entertain using relevant flow. It’s 
essentially rap lobbying, and they 
do a damn good job of it.

“NO,” Meghan Trainor’s 

ultra-catchy, tell-em-how-it-is 
dance floor 
jam had me 
thinking I 
could like 
Trainor. 
The track’s 
accom-
panying 
music video 
reminds me why I don’t.

Nothing seems to add up 

and everything feels off, at 
best. The static that opens 
the video isn’t in tune with 
the song’s vibe and the open-
ing lyrics play as Trainor’s 
black boots walk across a 

dark sidewalk, leading to the 
drop of the chorus as Trainor 
and dancers come together to 
pump out their routine.

Set in an urban basement, 

Trainor’s club vibes are lost 
in the emptiness. The exclu-
sion of male dancers / extras 
is understandable; “NO” is for 
the girls. However, in cutting 
the dance floor along with its 
male-counterparts, the video 
only leaves viewers wondering 
why Trainor and Co. are alone 
in this basement — a stark con-
trast to the song’s infectious 
energy.

Fresh off a Best New Art-

ist Grammy win, Trainor has 

released a single that’s, well, 
actually good. The same can-
not be said for the video. Poor 
dance skills aside, the few 
moments of magic occur when 
the song and Trainor’s person-
ality are favored over the idea 
of a tightly choreographed 
pop video. The video finds 
its groove in a series of shots 
featuring Trainor in a black 
mesh top, sitting around with 
her friends serving up some 
serious sass to the camera, but 
other than that it feels like 
rehearsal for a better video.

P.S. Keep the red hair. Burn 

that silver coat.

and 
locals, 
there 
exists 
an 

exclusive club unbeknownst to 
all but a select few students at the 
University of Michigan.

When they aren’t spending 

their 
days 
poring 
over 
the 

written 
works 
of 
Nietzsche 

and Rimbaud, Michigan’s most 
ardent anarchists gather in this 
off-campus location and prepare 
themselves for an evening of 
pure, unadulterated aggression. 
Punches and kicks are thrown, 
blood runs rampant and casual 
conversation 
ensues 
amongst 

members 
every 
Sunday 
and 

Wednesday night after the sun 
sets and the streets clear.

This is the University’s Fight 

Club, an organization absent from 
the University’s MaizePages and 
governed by seven imperative 
rules:

1. You don’t talk about Fight 

Club.

2. You DO NOT talk about 

Fight Club.

3. If someone says “stop,” taps 

out or decides to take a refreshing 
water break, the fight is over.

4. One fight at a time. There is 

limited space so we can’t destroy 
the premises or else we’ll have to 
go through the rounds of finding 
a new location. And we all know 
how long that took last time. I’m 
looking at you, Shelby.

5. No shoes, no jewelry and 

no children under the age of 13.

6. Fights will go on as long 

as they have to. Unless they last 
longer than five hours. No one 
wants to be here that long.

7. If this is your first time at 

Fight Club, you HAVE to fight. If 
it’s your second, then here, enjoy a 
blueberry scone.

The president of the club, 

like all of its members, only 
agreed to be interviewed on the 
condition that his identity remain 
anonymous. When asked about 
his year and major for this article, 
he referred to himself as both 
an LSA senior and a sophomore 
in the Stamps School of Art & 
Design.

“It’s kind of the first rule of 

Fight Club. You can’t talk about 
it,” Anonymous President said in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

So Daily Arts spoke to him 

about it. Having experienced a 
dramatic decline in membership 
over the past school year, Fight 
Club has been forced to abandon 
their 
holiest 
commandments 

in 
their 
desperation 
for 

fresh, 
unbloodied 
faces. 
As 

an 
organization 
completely 

independent from the University, 
membership is imperative.

“Every week, someone is in 

charge of snacks and someone 
else has to lead the recovery 
meditation and yoga session,” 
Anonymous Member with Nose 
Ring said, wiping the blood from 
his nose and reaching for a scone. 
“We’re 
all 
about 
teamwork, 

seeing as we’re entirely self-
funded.”

“We 
originally 
started 

organizing here because the 
owner was generous enough to 
provide refreshments at their 
one-of-a-kind cafe,” Unibrow-
Sporting Anonymous Member 
added as she dodged a swing from 
an oncoming student, took a kick 
to the groin and went crashing to 
the floor.

The club was first invented by 

Anonymous President in the fall 
of 2012.

“I originally got the idea from 

a Chuck Palahniuk book,” he said. 
“You should really check it out. 
It’s called ‘Lullaby.’ ”

Over the years, the University’s 

Fight Club has morphed and 
changed with its membership. 
Beginning as a Pink Floyd cover 
band in Anonymous President’s 
father’s garage, the club initially 
included three other members 
besides A.P. himself: Anonymous 
Drummer, Anonymous Guitarist 

and Anonymous Tambourinist.

“First, we were all about 

the music — it was electric,” 
Anonymous President said. “But 
when (Anonymous Guitarist) got 
electrocuted plugging in the amp 
one day, everything changed. 
We’d never seen anything like it. 
After that near-death experience, 
all we wanted to do was recreate 
that feeling of terror, of energy.”

It wasn’t until Anonymous 

Tambourinist 
took 
a 
swing 

at 
Anonymous 
Guitarist 
for 

suggesting that “maybe he should 
turn down his mic, and maybe 
take a few steps back, and then 
a few more” that the ragtag 
group of students realized what 
they were searching for — pure, 
unadulterated aggression.

And from there, it took off. 

Four members soon became three 
after losing Anonymous Guitarist 
to the Ross School of Business, 
and for a moment the creators 
considered 
giving 
up. 
Then, 

membership began to soar.

“I’m still not completely sure 

how people found out about it, 
but people just started to show 
up to my dad’s house on Thursday 
nights,” Anonymous President 
said. “I think most of them 
were trying to get back to North 
Campus, but when they saw us 
beating each other up, they sort of 
just joined in.”

Hospital fees and eviction 

hit the fledgling group like a 
bombshell, however, and they 
were forced out onto the streets. 

It was during this time that the 
bitterness started to creep up on 
the members, as the Ann Arbor 
Police Department repeatedly 
intervened in their fights in the 
middle of the Diag.

Officer Hoffman, a firsthand 

witness to the early meetings 
of the group, was reluctant to 
divulge information.

“It was a mess,” Hoffman said. 

“They were gathering anywhere 
they could — the UGLi, the 
Diag, Meijer, the First United 
Methodist Church of Ann Arbor. 
It was all we could do to get them 
off campus before they developed 
political stances.”

And develop political stances, 

they did.

Enraged by the “disrespect 

and dismissal” of the Ann Arbor 
Police 
Department, 
Division 

of Public Safety and Security 
and Neighborhood Watch, The 
Periwinkle 
Sandal 
(a 
name 

elected by early members of 
UMFC) took to the streets with 
their rage, painting pink circle-As 
all over Ann Arbor.

“It was meant to cause an 

outrage, but we messed up,” 
Anonymous 
Member 
with 

Sunglasses said, lying in a pool 
of his own blood. “The As were 
painted too closely together, 
and 
people 
just 
thought 
it 

was 
community 
pride. 
We 

accidentally created a brand.”

So they took to the basements, 

bars and ditches that would 
support their violent endeavors. 
Their punches and kicks revealed 
the students’ pent-up rage that 
mostly stemmed from suspended 
bitterness 
toward 
roommates 

who 
“wouldn’t 
load 
their 

goddamn dishes,” as Anonymous 
Member with a Rope Braid 
Headband described.

“It’s not like I’m asking her 

to go to a river, stick it in and 
wash it with some leaves,” he 
said as Anonymous Member 
with 
Crackle 
Nail 
Polish 

understandingly 
wrapped 
an 

arm around his shoulder. “Just 
place it on a rack and close the 
door. It’s so simple, and I feel like 
if she can’t respect her coffee 
mugs, how will she ever respect 
me as a long-term partner in this 
relationship?”

“Over the years, our mission 

statement 
has 
definitely 

evolved,” Anonymous Member 
with Crackle Nail Polish said. 
“Therapy plays a larger part than 
it did before. Adrenaline was the 
focus when it first formed, but as 
years progressed, a couple heroin 

addictions caused the dismissal 
of certain members and — let’s 
say we found a new direction.”

Initially an all-male group in 

the early years, UMFC strove for 
and achieved gender inclusivity 
with this new direction. Rules 
that were originally scrawled on 
two broken tombstones found 
in the Bob and Betty Beyster 
Building by one of the members 
were 
finally 
revisited 
and 

thought about in a broader, more 
politically correct context.

“Originally it was ‘No shirt, no 

shoes’ but, for obvious reasons, 
we changed it to ‘No shoes, no 
jewelry,’” Anonymous Member 
with Crackle Nail Polish said. 
“People kept bringing barbed 
wire and calling it jewelry. 
There’s only so many tetanus 
shots we can afford to cover.”

Another issue came when 

Shelby, an LSA junior, brought 
her 8-year-old brother Joshua to 
one of the meetings.

“Of course we weren’t going 

to say anything to her face — her 
parents are going through a rough 
divorce,” Anonymous Member 
with Crackle Nail Polish said. 
“The little guy came and watched 
the whole meeting, and when he 
just loved it we were all a little 
relieved. But then, the next week 
was Festifall, and that’s when shit 
went down.”

“Festifall 2014,” Anonymous 

President said. “Boy, was that a 
day. I remember walking through 
the Diag — I’d just picked up a 
flyer for a great new yoga club 
— and seeing, right by Mason 
Hall, a booth. Can you believe 
it? Shelby had actually set up a 
booth to advertise the club, and 
her brother Josh created all these 
adorable posters with all this 
ClipArt blood and a picture of a 
dead body.”

“After that, we slipped ‘no 

children under the age of 13’ 
into the bylaws,” Anonymous 
Member with Crackle Nail Polish 
said. “Of course, Shelby was also 
removed from the group, and we 
worked out with Central Student 
Government 
that 
Josh 
will 

never be allowed to attend the 
University. We can’t have people 
violating the bylaws.”

Since the kerfuffle with CSG, 

members of UMFC have become 
more disillusioned about the 
idea of a central government 
in general, even advocating for 
anarchy all together. When asked 
about their political leanings in 
the 2016 presidential election, 
most members of UMFC declined 
to answer.

“You’re missing the whole 

point if you’re expecting us to 
endorse 
one 
candidate 
over 

another,” Anonymous President 
said. “That said, if we had to pick 
one, it’d be Bernie.”

Anarchy, 
socialism, 
avant-

garde therapy and violence — 
UMFC embraces it all.

“Society has a stigma on 

violence and constantly presents 
it in a bad light,” Anonymous 
Member with a Rope Braid 
Headband 
said. 
“We’re 
all 

about flipping it around, taking 
a sociological perspective and 
making people realize, ‘Hey, I 
could use a safe space to let out 
my anger at my ineffective GSI, 
and also integrals.’”

In pursuit of transcendence 

and survival, the members of 
UMFC have abandoned the club’s 
ancient rules requiring strict 
privacy in hopes of saving it. 
While certain legalities prevent 
UMFC from being considered a 
student organization, by opening 
up their doors to the public, 
they hope to be greeted with an 
understanding and enthusiastic 
student population, one that 
accepts their unique therapeutic 
rituals for what they are and even 
provides first aid assistance in 
emergencies.

“Violence is a turn-off for some 

people,” Anonymous President 
said. “Most people, in fact. But 
we’re looking for that 1 percent 
that finds it intriguing. After 
all, Greek life freely exists on 
campus, so why can’t we?”

“I mean, what can I say? It’s 

all in the name — everything 
we want to communicate to our 
audience, to you, we put into the 
name,” guitarist Eric Goldman 
said while drinking his triple 
shot of espresso, grimacing with 
every sip.

The name in question is 

“Pussy Beacon,” and it refers 
to the Ann Arbor-based indie 
boy band taking the University 
of Michigan by storm. After 
meeting 
and 
becoming 
fast 

friends in a residential dorm 
freshman year, the five LSA 
juniors and comp lit majors of 
Pussy Beacon realized they had 
more in common than location.

“It’s actually a really, really, 

really funny story,” drummer Pat 
Alcheri said. “We were all living 
in West Quad, and we realized 
that we all played instruments.”

Lead vocalist Tom Arizona, 

formerly Tom Stein before a 
legal name change, cut him off. 
He said, “And then we realized 
that we all have the same ‘why’ 
for our music. We all started 
playing because chicks love 
musicians.”

“They also love being called 

chicks,” Goldman said, smirking, 
spinning his fedora around in 
his hands.

At first, the members of Pussy 

Beacon had been reluctant to 
share that they were musicians 
first and foremost to get girls.

“Eventually, we just decided 

to come out with it,” Goldman 
said. “Not come out in, like, a gay 
way — not that there’s anything 
wrong with that. At all! I have 
a friend who’s gay. We’re just 
super into girls. And we wanted 
everyone to know.” Thus, “Pussy 
Beacon” was born.

When asked if they thought 

the backlash their band name 
sometimes 
received 
was 

warranted, all five boys snorted 
in unison.

“We’re trying to be the most 

true to ourselves as we possibly 
can. The name reflects that. 
We’re not going to sell out to 
a major record company or 
anything like that,” harmonicist 
Mac Reynolds said, met with a 
chorus of “Fuck that!” by the 
other boys. “We just want to be 
indie-rock. Actually, we want 
TO indie rock! Can you put that 
in the article? I just thought of 
that right now. That was dope.”

The 
influences 
of 
Pussy 

Beacon span both genre and 
time period. Citing artists like 
Eminem and Jack Johnson, they 
made it clear that they weren’t 
just listening to artists of this 
generation — Dave Matthews 

Band of the ’90s also played 
a huge part in their artistic 
growth.

“I would describe us as a mix 

between Jason Mraz and blink-
182, because I think we can get 
sort of punk-ish sometimes,” 
pianist Nick Blad said. “But 
we’re still chill and indie.”

The band takes pride in 

the fact that besides Blad’s 
experience learning recorder 
in third grade, they are entirely 
self-taught.

“I actually learned how to play 

guitar from YouTube videos. I’m 
sort of crazy that way,” Goldman 
said, flicking his hair to the side. 
“I can just pick things up after 
doing them every day for two 
or three years. My friends call 
me Rain Man. I just get things 
without even trying, you know?”

Despite the lack of diversity in 

their group, Pussy Beacon sees 
the dearth of respect for people 

of color and women in the music 
industry as a huge problem.

“It sucks, man,” Reynolds 

said. “I just feel like there aren’t 
enough 
chicks 
making 
cool 

music, and that’s really hurting 
them. I’d love to help them out, if 
you know any girls who want to 
play. Harmonica isn’t as hard as 
people say it is, if you can believe 
it. I’ll give you my number and 
you can pass it on to any of your 
female friends.”

“But sometimes I just feel 

like girls aren’t as good at, like, 
real rock music, you know?” 
Goldman said. “Or, like, indie 
music.”

“Don’t get me wrong,” he 

hastened to add. “Girls are great! 
But guys and girls are just good 
at different things. Like Adele 
or Taylor Swift with those love 
songs and pop music? Not my 
vibe — there’s just not a whole 
lot of substance there — but, like, 
good for them.”

“And besides, we write a 

lot of songs about girls,” Blad 
said. “Wanna hear some of our 
favorite lyrics?”

Despite 
not 
receiving 
an 

affirmative answer, he began 
what the reporters at The 
Michigan Daily assumed to be a 
rap: “I know you slept with my 
friend / But I still think you’re a 
10 / You’re so hot, Naomi / and 
I just wish you would blow me.”

Though the theme of girls has 

dominated the band’s playlist on 
SoundCloud, it has also factored 

into challenges for the group.

“There was a time when 

Arizona wanted to fuck Pat’s 
hot Italian mom,” Goldman 
said. “So, yeah, there was some 
tension there.”

Luckily, 
the 
band 
has 

channeled their tensions into 
producing some of their proudest 
lyrical inventions.

“Arizona and I managed to 

work 
through 
the 
situation 

when he wrote a song about it,” 
Acheri said. “It goes, ‘You’re so 
much older, got so much on your 
shoulders / Your breasts are 
starting to sag / with the weight 
of your experience / I hate to 
brag / but I want to see them, I’m 
curious.’ After Arizona played 
that for me for the first time, 
I totally realized how he felt. 
I mean, all of us have had that 
relatable experience of wanting 
to see a pair, you know?”

In terms of improving racial 

diversity in indie music, the boys 
were a little stumped.

“I mean, Pat’s Italian,” Blad 

said. “I don’t really know how 
much better you expect us to 
do.”

“Second-generation, 
but 

still. People always ask me if 
I like pizza,” Acheri said. “So 
annoying. I guess, in that way, 
there is a real prejudice problem 
in the music industry.”

Pussy Beacon hopes to sign 

with a small record label in 
Brooklyn after graduation next 
year. Because of their experience 
playing in different venues, they 
see this plan as entirely feasible.

“We’ve actually played at 

co-op parties, fraternity parties 
and 
mixers,” 
Arizona 
said. 

“Mixers are when a fraternity 
and sorority socialize in a place 
that isn’t the house. It’s a totally 
different vibe. So yeah, I’d say 
we’re pretty well-equipped to 
handle whatever comes our 
way.”

Despite being in a public place 

and 
being 
repeatedly 
asked 

not to, Pussy Beacon ended the 
interview with a song.

“We’re going to play this 

song because it really speaks 
to who we are as a band and a 
collective group of awesome 
dudes,” Goldman said before 
sensually raising a disconnected 
microphone to his mouth. “It’s 
a cover, but I don’t think you’ll 
ever have heard of it. It’s a song 
about trust, and really getting 
someone, like on a fundamental 
level, you know? Hope you enjoy. 
It’s called ‘Wonderwall.’

an April Fools parody B-Side

In an effort to diversify their 

lineup, Bravo has premiered a new 
spin on their Real Housewives 
series — 
unlike 
“The Real 
House-
wives of 
New Jer-
sey,” “New 
York City,” 
“Miami” 
and the 
other 
series, “The Future Real House-
wives of Ann Arbor” centers on, 
well, women who are 19 going on 
20, instead of 40 going on 19.

The diverse cast follows five 

freshman gals at the University 
of Michigan as they search for 
love in this crazy college town. 
Rachel, Sarah, Ali, Emma and 
Apple-North Moses get into a 
cat fight over the same frat guy 
within the first 10 minutes of the 
pilot episode alone. Set at Tau 
Epsilon Kappa’s “fifths and cuffs” 
rager, each future housewife, 
with their long dark hair and 
cute Adidas Superstars, learns 
that Timmy asked them all to his 

formal in Chicago the following 
weekend. How did they learn this 
earth-shattering news, one might 
ask? Their frat boi dates told them 
because when you’re handcuffed 
to a guy you barely know with a 
fifth of Kamchatka in your other 
hand, well, shit happens.

So for the remainder of the 

pilot we see some wild “Real 
Housewives of New Jersey”-style 
drama commence; lots of tears are 
shed, a few dresses are ripped to 
shreds and fake tans are ruined. 
Obviously, Timmy tries to put an 
end to this drama by reassuring 
all of the girls that there’s lots of 
chances to hook up in the future, 
but alas, Timmy ends up soaked 
in their cans of Natty Light. Of 
course Timmy gets pissed — his 
Timberlands and Canada Goose 
jacket are completely ruined 
(why Timmy is wearing a Canada 
Goose jacket at a steamy frat 
part is beyond me). But, like the 
gentleman that Timmy is, he 
calls each gal a Lyft (not an Uber, 
because Timmy messed that one 
up) home.

All this drama is quite 

entertaining to watch. It’s 
refreshing to see such intelligent 
college co-eds put their feelings 
on display so publicly. If you 

think this new reality show is just 
another “Jersey Shore,” you’d be 
wrong! We actually learn quite 
a lot from “The Future Real 
Housewives of Ann Arbor.” For 
example, we learn that Rachel, 
Sarah, Ali, Emma and Apple-
North Moses are all majoring in 
communications because they 
want to be able to educate their 
kids on the ~harmful effects of 
the media~. We even learn some 
Econ 101 as they get tutored by 
Ross students (it’s OK that they’re 
just taking Econ to find a Ross 
husband, right?), and we also 
learn some healthy habits as they 
fill their plates with kale, workout 
at the Ross gym and proceed to 
drink a fifth of vodka later that 
night!

Overall, I’d say this is the best 

spin on the Real Housewives 
series to date. After all, what 
could be better than watching 
some goal-oriented kids seize life 
by the balls, one bottle of Ciroc at 
a time?

Editor’s note: This is part of 

an April Fool’s parody B-Side 
issue. All events and individuals 
depicted are fictional (to the best of 
our knowledge). There’s probably 
someone out there named Apple-
North, though.

Is This It, OK Computer, In 

Rainbows, Funeral, Modern 
Vampires of 
the City — 
all modern 
classics in 
today’s messy 
“rock” genre. 
But there is 
one album 
frequently 
missing from 
these lists 
— something so necessary, 
so moving, so carefully 
constructed that I shouldn’t 
even have to mention its name 
(but I will): Nickelback’s Dark 
Horse.

Everything about this album 

screams nuance and genius. 
Take the album art, which acts 
as an intimate window into the 
world we’re about to jump into: a 
steel belt buckle. It’s this kind of 
beaming strength and fortitude 
that propels Nickelback’s 

career highlight above even the 
most accomplished of bands. 
While Nirvana carried the 
grunge era with impressive 
instrumentation and subtle 
lyrics, Nickelback’s Dark Horse 
dominates a genre that’s even 
better — post-grunge. The 
album finds the band eschewing 
those pompous, pretentious 
styles that critics love so much 
for what the world really 
wants to hear: just four good-
ol’ white boys from Canada, 
speaking to the good-ol’ white 
boys of the world. While most 
music writers and audiophiles 
might see their guitar skills 
as questionable, their lyrics as 
shallow and their existence as 
purposeless, Nickelback’s fans 
know something those high-
minded fucks don’t. What that 
is, though, is more mysterious 
and cryptic than even the band 
itself.

I’ll admit, I had some 

difficulty listening to the album 
in its entirety. I started to feel 
a bit queasy by the third track, 

“Gotta Be Somebody.” But I’m 
sure that was just the norovirus 
setting in from the dining 
hall food I’d consumed a few 
hours before, and certainly not 
the result of Chad Kroeger’s 
perpetually distressed vocals, 
which wrap listeners like a 
blanket of hearty, countryside 
soil. What I did know, though, 
from the few tracks my feeble 
body was able to handle, was 
that I was listening to the 
unabridged soul of rock — nay, 
music as a whole.

The band’s decision to open 

with “Something in Your 
Mouth” is a complex one, and 
I’m still unraveling its meaning. 
Kroeger proclaims the damsel in 
this story is “so much cuter with 
something in (her) mouth.” My 
initial thought was that the song 
was encouraging the woman to 
utter her feelings confidently, 
without the interference of a 
man — a message of feminist 
empowerment, if you will. 
Follow-up lyric “in the spotlight 
all night dissing everyone”

seems to support this analysis.

My point of confusion came 

when I heard Kroeger state that 
the woman will “tease them 
all by sucking on (her) thumb.” 
In certain cultures, thumb-
sucking is a sign of disrespect, 
so perhaps he’s speaking both 
to the woman’s multicultural 
heritage and her independence. 
For North Americans, though, 
thumb-sucking alludes 
to childhood, so it’s not 
inconceivable to think that 
Kroeger is hinting at a deeper 
story altogether here, one 
that centers on the adolescent 
experience of this woman. Such 
complexities seethe throughout 
Dark Horse.

Attempting to pin down 

highlights on this album is 
bound to be a fruitless endeavor 
— they’re all highlights. 
Listeners might find it difficult 
to decipher one track from 
another, but that simply 
speaks to the consistency and 
confidence that Nickelback has 
with their sound. It warrants no 
alteration or experimentation. 
Why add confusion to 
perfection?

Nickelback’s most compelling 

skill, though, is their ability to 
create a community through 
the medium of music. There 
are few places in the world like 
a Nickelback concert, where 
a 40-year-old-plus, white, 
feminazi-hating suburban dad 
can find so many other people 
just like him. That unifying 
sameness is a powerful tool, and 
one that Nickelback should not 
— and does not — take lightly. 
Dark Horse is their gift to the 
world, sure, but even more so 
it’s a love letter to Nickelback’s 
fan base. Reverence to followers 
is a necessity, and one that 
many bands fail to account 
for. Nickelback makes no such 
mistake.

Some of those previously 

mentioned pompous critic 
fucks have mistakenly accused 
Nickelback of creating nothing 
more than reductive, cliché hard 
rock music. But I ask: could 
the five million people who 
purchased Dark Horse have all 
been misguided? When have 
millions of people ever been 
misguided? That’s right: never.

Editor’s Note: This is part of an 

April Fools parody B-Side issue. 
Don’t beat up Matt for his bad 
opinions.
