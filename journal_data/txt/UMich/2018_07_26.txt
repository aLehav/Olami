A talk with Maureen Riley, 
director of one of the art fairs

Maureen Riley 
discusses how 
the Art Fair has 
grown over time

By JACK BRANDON

Summer Managing Arts Editor

The Annual Ann Arbor Art Fair 
took place last Thursday through 
Sunday, bringing artists, vendors, 
shoppers and spectators who lined 
the blocks of South University, 
North University, Main, Liberty 
and State. For a town that sees 
older teens and twenty-somethings 
most of the year, Ann Arbor in the 
summertime can fall into a lull. 
The Art Fair brings a much needed 
pulse of energy to midsummer ease 
of downtown.
In a phone interview with the 
Daily, Maureen Riley, executive 
director of the Ann Arbor Street 
Art Fair, The Original, delved into 
the history of the Art Fair. Riley 

said that beginning in 1960, the 
art fair was put forth as an idea by 
one of the merchants in the South 
University area. “It was pre-mall, 
and all of the shopping was in 
town,” Riley said. “When all of the 
students went away in the summer, 
those businesses needed extra 
help.”
The fair, which boasted three 
music stages, over 1,000 artists, 
and an expectation of 500,000 
visitors according to M-Live, is in 
its 59th year. Despite its longevity, 
Riley says through the decades, the 
Fair’s mission has remained largely 
the same: to drive business into 
downtown Ann Arbor during the 
quiet of summer and to promote 
knowledge and appreciation of art. 
“The State Street Art Fair and the 
South University Art Fair all have 
business within their footprint 
that participate within their fairs,” 
Riley said, “particularly State 
Street. There are merchants from 
the stores on the street. That’s part 
of the fun of Ann Arbor.”
In other ways, however, the 

phenomenon that is the Ann 
Arbor Art Fair has splintered and 
shifted. In beginning, the first 
artist markets were only hosted on 
South University. After the events’ 
repeated successes, year after year, 
the State Street area created a fair 
of its own. “I believe that was ’67. 
So there were two,” Riley said. She 
continued, “there were so many 
artists that wanted to be part of it, 
and it had been very successful for 
the South University businesses.”
The Art Fair continued to grow 
into the aughts, and two more fairs 
would spring up. A group of artists 
started the Free Fair, in which they 
sold their wares on blankets in the 
diag, but the University put the 
kibosh on that. “Ultimately, that 
became the guild of artists and 
artisans in the summer art fair. 
Which is why the summer art fair 
has two locations: a few blocks on 
state street adjacent to the diag, 
because they started there,” Riley 

Nassar appeals 
abuse sentence

Former USA gymnastics 
coach challenges 
objectivity of judge

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Larry Nassar, former USA Gymnastics and 
MSU physician sentenced to 40 to 175 years in 
prison for sexual abuse, filed for a retrial and 
asked for a new sentencing hearing as well as 
a new judge to hear his case.
Nassar’s appeal claims Judge Rosemarie 
Aquilina of the Ingham County Case used 
the hearing as a platform to promote her own 
politics and villainize Nassar.
“Judge 
Aquilina 
made 
numerous 
statements throughout the proceedings 
indicating that she had already decided 
to impose the maximum allowed by 
the sentence agreement even before the 
sentencing hearing began,” the retrial 
filing reads. “Thus, from the defendant’s 
perspective the sentencing hearing was just 
a ritual.”
According to the filing, Nassar was 
assaulted within hours of entering the prison’s 
general population in May. The appeal claims 
the assault due to Aquilina’s villainization of 
him in court, alleging Aquilina was swayed 
by public outrage against Nassar.
“Instead of proceeding to assist the judge 
in reaching a fair and just sentencing decision, 
the judge used the nationally-televised 
proceeding as an opportunity to advance 
her own agenda, including to advocate for 
policy initiatives within the state as well as 
the federal legislatures, to push for broader 
cultural change regarding gender equity and 
sexual discrimination issues, and, seemingly 
as a type of group therapy for the victims” the 
filing reads.
Nassar’s 
attorneys 
argue 
Aquilina 
made her personal disdain for Nassar clear 
throughout the sentencing both in court and 
through multiple media interviews as well 
as her attendance at the 2018 ESPN ESPYS 
Awards where Nassar victims received the 
Arthur Ashe Courage Award.

Phishing scam goes after 

U-M Weblogin credentials

Fake payroll emails 
link to fraudulent 
Weblogin page

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

A string of fraudulent payroll 
emails, 
distributed 
among 
University of Michigan community 
members on July 13, scammed 
some recipients into revealing 
their U-M online credentials. The 
messages directed recipients to a 
fake Weblogin page in an attempt 
to steal their passwords, a type of 
cyberattack known as phishing.
U-M 
Safe 
Computing 
immediately released a notice 
warning 
the 
University 
community about the scam and 
outlining a plan for defusing the 
situation. In order to shut down the 
attack, information administrators 
blocked the IP address on U-M 
networks 
and 
took 
steps 
to 
digitally flag the site. They also 
worked to remove unopened scam 
emails from recipients’ mailboxes 

and helped affected employees 
change their passwords.
In an email interview with 
The Daily, University Privacy 
Officer Sol Bermann, the interim 
U-M chief information security 
officer, said the University’s quick 
response 
helped 
contain 
the 
damage caused by the phishing 
attempt.
“The 
U-M 
Information 
Assurance team quickly identified 
this phishing attack, and took a 
number of steps to quickly mitigate 
its effectiveness,” Bermann wrote. 
“Our team continues to improve on 
how we detect and rapidly respond 
to these sorts of threats, as a result, 
very very few U-M community 
members were affected by this 
attack.”
Bermann 
suggested 
U-M 
faculty, employees and students 
learn more about phishing scams 
on the Safe Computing website, 
and also recommended turning 
on two-factor authentication at 
Weblogin.

Team of researchers 
beats IBM’s record

By ELIZABETH LAWRENCE

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of engineers at the 
University of Michigan has 
created 
a 
computer 
small 
enough to stand on the tip of a 
grain of rice. With a volume of 
0.4 cubic millimeters, it holds 
the title of the world’s smallest 
computer, outdoing IBM’s most 
recent attempt.
Because of its small size, 
there are limitations on what 
the device can actually do. 
But according to Xiao Wu, an 
Engineering doctorate student 
who worked on the project, the 
defining elements of a computer 
are all present.
“It has basic components 
of a computer,” Wu said. “It 
has a microprocessor that’s (a) 
general purpose processor unit. 
It’s an Arm patent Cortex-M0+, 
so it’s a commercial processor. 
And it’s also got its own 
memory. So it’s a smaller and 
simpler version of a computer, 
but it’s got basic elements of the 
computer.”
The computer is the product 
of many years of work, according 
to David Blaauw, a professor 
of electrical engineering and 
computer science who co-led 
the recent project and has been 
working on tiny computing 
since 2005. Throughout the 

years, his team has found ways 
to reduce power consumption 
of computer chips and circuits, 
enabling the development of 
smaller computers.
Blaauw said with such low 
power consumption comes the 
challenge of figuring out how to 
make a computer run.
“We consume, in standby 
mode when the sensor’s sort 
of dormant, a few nanoamps, 
whereas a cell phone would 
consume 
a 
few 
milliamps,” 
Blaauw said. “So it’s about a 
million times less than a cell 
phone 
power 
consumption 
in the same kind of dormant 
mode.”
Blaauw 
said 
another 
challenge is that the computer 
can only be handled wirelessly. 
His team communicates with 
the 
computer 
though 
light 
signals, and also uses light 
to recharge it. Regular-size 
computers and cell phones are 
able to charge through wires, 
but the new computer is too 
small for any kind of connector.
“We can’t just conveniently 
charge it, it has to charge itself 
with light or something like 
that,” Blaauw said. “It can’t 
sort of reprogram itself easily 
with the wire. You need to do 
it wirelessly. Everything needs 
to be done wirelessly; it’s very 
challenging.”

Admissions drops 

ACT and SAT writing 

U-M seeks to reduce 
costs for applicants

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Following the lead of uni-
versities such as Harvard, Yale, 
Princeton and Stanford, the Uni-
versity of Michigan will no longer 
require students to complete the 
optional writing component of 
the SAT or ACT when the Univer-
sity’s application goes live Aug. 1.
Kedra 
Ishop, 
vice 
provost 
for 
enrollment 
management, 
explained in a University Record 
press release there were several 
reasons that made the optional 
writing component expendable 
for the University.
Erica 
Sanders, 
director 
of 
undergraduate 
admissions, 
explained the new SAT structure 
developed in 2016 was a contrib-
uting factor.
“With recent changes to the 
SAT, we realized that this addi-
tional writing score was no lon-
ger needed,” Sanders said. “We’re 
confident in our holistic review 
process, which is both individual-
ized for each applicant and com-
prehensive.”
In 2016, the new SAT switched 
to more evidence-based writing 
and reading sections. In the new 
SAT, scored from 400 to 1600 
points instead of 600 to 2400, the 
test also no longer categorizes 
reading and writing individually.
In addition to reporting one’s 
SAT or ACT score, the U-M 
application requires students to 
submit multiple writing samples 
in response to several different 
writing prompts.
“We believe we have suffi-
cient evidence to assess an appli-
cant’s writing ability without the 
optional portions of these exams 
that add cost and time to student 
testing,” Ishop said.
Fewer than two dozen schools 
still require the optional writing 
component, which was developed 
in 2005 for both the SAT and 
ACT in an effort to promote the 
importance of clear and effective 
academic writing. The University 
adopted the additional require-

ment the following year.
According to InsideHigherEd, 
about 70 percent of students who 
take the SAT each year take the 
writing test even though many 
will attend universities that do 
not require the additional com-
ponent.
The article quotes James Mur-
phy, director of national outreach 
for the Princeton Review, who 
wrote in response to Ivy League 
universities eliminating the com-
ponent.
“We are really pleased to see 
Princeton and Stanford join not 
only six other Ivy League univer-
sities but also more than 1,600 
other schools across the country 
in their decision not to require 
the essay,” Murphy wrote. “This 
is good for students and does no 
harm to schools. Writing well is 
an essential skill for college and 
beyond, but these assessments 
do a poor job in evaluating writ-
ing skill. We look forward to the 
23 schools that still require the 
essays coming to see the light.”
The 2018 SAT costs $47.50 
without the essay component, 
requiring an additional $17 to 
include it. Similarly, the ACT 
costs $50.50 with the writing 
test an additional $16.50. While 
some students can qualify for 
fee exemptions based on family 
income, the total price of the SAT 
and ACT does not include the cost 
to send test results to more than 
four universities.
According 
to 
The 
Univer-
sity Record, the Office of Under-
graduate Admissions has already 
updated its website to reflect this 
change and shared the news with 
all deans, associate deans, unit 
liaisons and campus communica-
tors.
Currently, 
the 
University 
requires prospective students to 
submit their high school tran-
script, school report – includ-
ing their GPA and class rank 
– one teacher evaluation and a $75 
application fee alongside their 
ACT or SAT score.
The early-action application 
deadline for the University of 
Michigan is Nov. 1 and the regu-
lar application deadline is Feb. 1.

Democratic gubernatorial candidates 
talk healthcare, recreational marijuana

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor 

Michigan’s Democratic guber-
natorial candidates gathered at 
WDIV Local 4 in Detroit Thurs-
day night for their final debate 
before the Aug. 7 primaries. 
Abdul El-Sayed, former execu-
tive director of the Detroit Health 
Department, entrepreneur Shri 
Thanedar and Gretchen Whit-
mer, former minority leader of 
the Michigan Senate, discussed 
healthcare, tax reform, marijuana 
and partisan division, and clashed 
over corporate involvement in 
their respective campaigns.
Moderators Devin Scillian and 
Kimberly Gill launched the debate 
by asking candidates to provide 
opening statements. Thanedar, 
who currently holds an estimated 
19 percent of the Democratic vote, 
emphasized his underprivileged 
upbringing in India, his climb to 
success in the United States chem-
ical industry and the fact that he 
created jobs through his company, 
Avomeen Analytical Services. El-
Sayed, who lags Thanedar at 17 
percent, focused on his opposition 
to corporate favoritism, saying he 
values real Michiganders.
“It is time to go back to a gov-
ernment for the people and by the 
people,” El-Sayed said.
Whitmer, the leading candi-
date with 40 percent of the Demo-
cratic vote, said she loves the state 
of Michigan and is dedicated to 
improving 
its 
infrastructure, 
insurance systems and education. 
She also brought up her opposi-
tion to leading Republican candi-
date Bill Schuette.

Unemployment
The moderators acknowledged 
Michigan has gained half a mil-
lion jobs and is now at its lowest 
unemployment rate in 17 years 
since current Gov. Rick Snyder 
took office in 2010. Scillian and 
Gill invited the candidates to 
share how they will keep those 
improvements in place.
Thanedar said the key to boost-
ing Michigan’s economy is invest-
ing in education, giving people the 
skills necessary to succeed in the 
workforce. Specifically, he men-
tioned his plan to make commu-
nity college tuition-free.
“I’ve created jobs, and I know 
what it takes to create jobs,” 
Thanedar said. “Corporate incen-
tives don’t create jobs, giving skill 
sets to the people of Michigan will 
create jobs and I will focus my 
efforts on bringing technical and 
skilled education.”
According to El-Sayed, employ-
ment has increased in Michigan, 
but not all jobs are highly skilled 
or well-paid. He accused corpo-
rations of not valuing the aver-
age worker, and promised to help 
small businesses thrive.
“I’m not going to be taking a 
dime of corporate money, so I’m 
not going to be in a situation where 
those same corporations come to 
my office and ask me to use the 
Michigan economic development 
corporation to pass them off these 
subsidies,” El-Sayed said.
Like Thanedar, Whitmer men-
tioned the importance of invest-
ing in high-quality education, 
saying she hopes to provide debt-
free, two-year college to Michi-
gan residents.

Tax Reform
Referencing the fact that the 
Republican gubernatorial candi-
dates aim to cut taxes, the mod-
erators asked the Democrats how 
they will convince people that tax 
increases could benefit Michigan.
El-Sayed suggested the reason 
people feel overtaxed is because 
of inefficient government spend-
ing of tax dollars. When the 
Republicans mention tax cuts, El-
Sayed added, they mean tax cuts 
for corporations rather than mak-
ing business pay their fair share. 
Whitmer agreed with El-Sayed’s 
point about government spend-
ing, saying the state’s refusal to 
invest in resources like clean 
water and high-quality educa-
tion forces people to spend more 
money day-to-day.
“We’re paying an education 
tax every time you hire a tutor 
because your kid’s teacher is so 
overwhelmed with kids packed 
into the classroom,” Whitmer 
said. “We’re paying a water tax 
— if you are in Flint, or if you are 
in one of the 71 communities with 
lead in your water, or the tens, 
maybe hundreds of communities 
with P-Phos in your water, you’re 
paying a water tax because you’ve 
got to pay bottled water because 
government’s not getting the job 
done.”
Thanedar proposed eliminat-
ing the state income tax for any 
family making under $50,000 
annually and said he will tax cor-
porations in order to fund educa-
tion and infrastructure.

Whitmer, El-Sayed criticize each other’s campaign finances

COURTESY OF WDIV


With 
regard 
to 
June’s 
widely publicized and widely 
criticized, summit with North 
Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, 
President Donald Trump had 
this to say about his totalitarian 
counterpart: “I made a deal with 
him; I shook hands with him. 
I really believe he means it.” 
 
Beyond the narcissistic bluster 
of such a statement, made in the 
aftermath of a “deal” that saw 
the United States trade regional 
military presence for nothing 
more than a promise, such 
faith in a regime as martially 
motivated as Kim’s captures 
the stunning gullibility of our 
president.
Stateside, President Trump 
recently reminded us of his 
equally 
innate 
knack 
for 
dishonesty; 
paying 
no 
heed 
to his own administration’s 
endorsement 
of 
its 
family-
separation policy at the southern 
border, nor to his own party’s 
legislative majority, he labeled 
the cruel policy a “law” of the 
Democrats’ doing and charged 
the 
Democrats 
with 
the 
responsibility of changing it. 
While these egregious displays of 
poor leadership are by all means 
disheartening, 
the 
minimal 
fallout stemming from them – 
that is, the ability of Trump to 
continue 
leading 
confidently 
after making these statements – 
makes obvious the great power 
Trump wields over his party. 
To be sure, Trump’s general 
popularity 
is 
by 
all 
means 
reflective of his divisive tactics: 
Poll-wise, Trump fares, and has 
fared, worse than other modern 
presidents. Frequent jabs at 
Trump’s policies and behavior 
in national media do, however, 
hinder widespread recognition 
of the ironclad grip he has on the 
GOP: Approval ratings of Trump 
among Republicans have peaked 
at 88 percent, up significantly 
since last year. 
As made evident by Trump’s 
domineering 
hold 
over 
the 
Republican 
Party, 
the 
myth 
of 
the 
“regular 
Republican” 
as anything but a negligible 
minority is just that. Those 
Republicans – sold on free trade, 
wary of Russia, and willing to 
sacrifice 
short-term 
political 
gain for the maintenance of 
democratic 
civility, 
among 
other things – do not represent 
the devout holdouts of the 
Republican Party that have stuck 

it out. Rather, they constitute 
politically vagrant conservatives 
whose party’s shift towards 
obnoxious populism and near-
absolute alignment with Trump 
happened blisteringly quick. 

America’s 
Trump 

contingent, therefore, is both 
overwhelmingly 
Republican 
yet 
proudly 
distanced 
from 
Republican tenets of yesteryear. 
Beyond the usual socio-economic 
divisions that traditionally help 
define political preferences, the 
most salient issues for Trump’s 
congregation are indeed those 
pertaining to race and culture. 
From here, typically lukewarm 
political allegiance has been 
exchanged for fervent devotion, 
of 
which 
the 
irredeemably 
race-obsessed maverick at the 
forefront of the new GOP is the 
subject. As a result, Trump’s 
base, more so than other political 
cohorts, finds singularity in a 
very select and vocal slice of the 
news media. 
We grossly underestimate the 
power of this “Trump-ist” media, 
yet it serves as the lifeline for the 
Trump presidency and its often-
disastrous 
survival. 
Trump’s 
mandate to rule, after all, is 
only as solid as the continued 
support of his Republican base. 
Trump-friendly media, namely 
the hegemonic Fox News, is 
the linchpin of this mandate, 
providing 
dedicated 
Trump 
voters with pro-Trump coverage 
on a scale unmatched by liberal 
media counterparts, and going 
beyond validation of existing 
beliefs 
by 
impeding 
access 
to new ones. It is an age-old 
relationship between viewers 
largely informed by media and 
politicians keenly sensitive to the 
opinions of these viewers, only 
without the diversity of media 
sources found in most other 
cases.
One 
would 
reason, 
then, 
that stemming this flow of 
unabashedly 
dogmatic 
and 
sycophantic coverage with apt 
and 
well-received 
criticism 
could curtail its allure. This 
could 
then 
soften 
Trump’s 
dominion over the Republican 
electorate and, suddenly, getting 
away with ludicrous statements 
would be a bit costlier for the 
president.

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

F

or a good portion of my early 
adolescence, my primary goal 
was to be just like Miley in 
the Disney Channel show Hannah 
Montana. In the show, Miley is an 
awkward, unpopular high school 
student who has a huge secret: she’s 
actually international pop superstar 
Hannah 
Montana. 
Somehow, 
nobody at her school knows her 
secret identity because, when she 
performs as Hannah, she wears a 
blonde wig. In fifth grade, I had my 
pop star alter ego all figured out. I 
had given her a name and sketched 
a wig in my journal. I was ready for 
fame.
Retrospectively, it makes perfect 
sense that I would resonate with a 
character like Miley. I was the tall-
est girl in my school, I was clumsy 
and unathletic, always embarrassing 
myself in gym class, and my social 
skills were exceptionally lacking. 
Simply put, I was the weird girl in 
school. I wanted desperately to fit in.
Miley appealed to me because 
the show always made it abundant-
ly clear that she wasn’t well-liked 
in school. In the pilot episode, the 
popular girls, Amber and Ashley, 
tell Miley she has to sit at “the loser 
table” at lunch. Scenes like that made 
me identify with Miley; she wasn’t 
some untouchable celebrity, she was 
a girl like me. But, unlike me, Miley 
rose above her circumstances. She 
became a famous singer, and when-
ever Amber and Ashley made fun of 
her, she could look them in the eyes 
with the knowledge that she was 

more successful than they’d ever be.
I wonder how my middle school 
career would’ve turned out if Miley’s 
glamorous alter ego Hannah Mon-
tana was a famous author, not a 
famous singer. Why? Because I was 
good at writing, and I actually enjoyed 
it enough that, had I set the goal of 
writing a book, I would’ve been will-
ing to put in the necessary work to 
achieve that goal. But, in my mind, 
writing was nerdy and unglamorous; 
it was the kind of thing that would 
make me less popular than I already 
was. 
Can you blame my younger self for 
wanting to be a pop star? I certainly 
can’t. Even today, I tend to idolize the 
characters I see on my TV screen. 
Has anyone ever watched Legally 
Blonde and not been inspired to start 
studying for the LSAT? 
However, my story tells a valuable 
lesson about the power of female role 
models on television, and representa-
tion in general. According to a study 
by Dr. Amy I. Nathanson, an assistant 
professor of journalism and commu-
nication at Ohio State University, girls 
who watch more TV are more likely to 
have an interest in traditionally femi-
nine jobs, such as that of secretary, 
dancer, model...or teen pop sensation. 
This makes perfect sense. From ages 
11 to 13, CNN reports that children 
“feel self-conscious about physical 
changes and feel pressure to conform 
to cultural gender norms.” When 
you’re an insecure middle school 
student and a character like Hannah 
Montana looks glamorous and beau-

tiful every time she steps onstage, of 
course you’re going to aspire to be like 
her. But what if Miley’s alter ego was 
a glamorous, world-famous, beloved 
engineer? How many more women 
would be enrolled in the College of 
Engineering right now?
Representation doesn’t just mean 
representation of a broad range of 
careers for females. Frankly, I was 
extremely lucky in middle school 
because I had a role model on televi-
sion at all. I was raised in a sociocul-
tural context in which I was able to 
identify simply as a “girl”, and there-
fore felt that I could view all female 
characters as role models. Others, 
depending on the circumstances in 
which they were raised, might iden-
tify not simply by their gender, but 
by their race, ability, socioeconomic 
status, etc. 
Stereotypes still largely prevail in 
television, and probably still affect the 
career goals of insecure young girls. 
The good news? The entertainment 
world is getting better. Every day, 
more kids’ shows come out featur-
ing more characters of color, more 
women in STEM, more sensitive men 
and career-oriented women. I’d like 
to think that, as students at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, we’re a part of 
that; we’re the role models we didn’t 
have when we were younger. I just 
wish that I could go back and tell my 
eleven-year-old self to dream a little 
bigger than international pop super-
star.

AUDREY GILMOUR | COLUMN

uring October of my 
freshman 
year 
of 
college, 
my 
father 
bought me a pink can of pepper 
spray to keep with me at all 
times. Starting college in 2015, 
everyone 
was 
talking 
about 
sexual assault. The statistics 
were circling, nearly a quarter of 
women attending college would 
be sexually assaulted. Across 
the country, young women were 
stepping up and sharing stories 
about the ways their bodies had 
been treated as objects. Young 
women, like the student at 
Columbia University carrying 
her 
dorm 
mattress 
across 
campus from class to class, were 
brave and inspiring in their fight 
to create awareness. I struggled 
to imagine why any victim of 
sexual assault would keep their 
story private in this time of 
social change.
Reporting 
and 
charging 
sexual predators was such a 
simple concept to me at the time. 
Perpetrators of sexual assault 
deserve 
to 
be 
charged 
and 
disciplined for their actions. 
More importantly, they need to 
be prevented from continuing a 
pattern of harm. This was the 
way I understood sexual assault 
and society’s reaction to it. I 
knew charging sexual assault 
was never easy; I had seen plenty 
of stories in the news about 
men emerging with less-than-
appropriate sentences as the 
legal system chose to put their 
future over those of the affected 
women. However, despite the 
difficulties 
that 
came 
with 
legal action, I felt that it was 
every victim’s responsibility to 
act and ensure their assaulter 
would never be able to harm 
another. What I was not able to 
comprehend at the time is that I 
was one of the many women that 
had been sexually assaulted and 
chosen not to act on it. 
As a young girl I was repeatedly 
molested and assaulted over a 
period of roughly two years. I 
was a 10-year-old girl smitten 
with the boy down the street, 
certain 
I 
was 
in 
love. 
He 
was a 14-year-old boy taking 
advantage of the power he knew 
he possessed over me. It took me 
years to realize that what had 
conspired between the two of 
us was not consensual, though 
it may have felt it at times. No 
matter the feelings I thought 

I felt for this boy, I was in no 
way capable of consenting to the 
actions that took place in dark 
corners of the park and empty 
bedrooms. Despite eventually 
coming to this realization, I 
never considered myself a victim 
of rape. I saw it as a chapter in 
my past and tried to believe I 
had left it firmly there.
Half a year ago I realized my 
past was not stagnant. My sexual 
assault is a fluid part of my 
existence, affecting my mental 
state to this day, and with this 
reality came the understanding 

that what happened to me was 
significant. My assault was just 
as significant as that of the young 
woman at Columbia carrying her 
mattress on her back. My assault 
was significant and if I chose to 
do so, I could take my rapist to 
court. I began preparing myself 
mentally for the battle ahead 
and went through old Facebook 
messages looking for evidence. 
I met with a close lawyer friend 
and 
explored 
my 
options, 
ranging from restraining orders 
to a lawsuit. For a week or two 
I believed this was finally my 
path to closure. The process of 
having my assault recognized 
legally would force me to fully 
accept what had been done to me 
and move forward. I was sure 
of my decision, until I returned 
home for winter break and 
found myself frozen at the idea 

of telling my parents what had 
happened to me.
I was acting, doing something 
I 
considered 
to 
be 
my 
responsibility by making sure 
my rapist wouldn’t be able to 
impact someone else’s life in the 
way that he had impacted mine. 
This was what I believed in. So 
why couldn’t I tell my parents? 
I told myself that I was being a 
coward and with a bit of bravery 
I would eventually be capable of 
confiding in my parents about 
this dark stain on my past. Every 
time I contemplated telling them 
I remembered things: the day my 
dad bought me pink pepper spray 
and told me that he would have 
to kill someone if they ever hurt 
me, the pain and worry in my 
parents’ eyes and voices when I 
struggled with depression and 
panic attacks as a freshman in 
college. I couldn’t bear to see 
their reactions to one of their 
worst nightmares coming true.
For months I lived with my 
decision not to tell my parents 
about my assault or pursue 
legal action. I saw myself as 
a hypocrite for not acting on 
what I perceived as a personal 
responsibility. 
How 
could 
I 
expect others who have had 
similar 
experiences 
to 
take 
action when I couldn’t? The 
thing about sexual assault is 
that you are never fully healed; 
it is never fully in the past. 
Every day I make decisions 
that are affected by my assault, 
even though it happened over a 
decade ago. It took me 10 years 
to process what happened to 
me and I am just now starting 
to recognize the significance of 
my experience. Right now, the 
healing process includes sharing 
my story with those closest to 
me, including my parents. For 
me, healing will probably never 
include 
taking 
legal 
action 
like I might have thought six 
months ago – and that’s okay. I 
am slowly learning, no victim 
of assault has a responsibility 
to take outward action. The 
only responsibility we have is to 
become survivors and do what 
is necessary to make ourselves 
start to feel healthy again.

OPINION

Thursday, July 26, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Some may find discomfort 
in this idea and view it as 
a biased assault on news 
media, which is guaranteed 
the right of free speech—
up to and including false 
statements. 
However, 
protection 
of 
the press does not excuse 
an institution as large and 
influential as the news media 
from deliberately misleading 
large swaths of listeners to 
the scale and degree seen 
with Fox News. The network 
has shed contributors hostile 
to Trump and tailored nearly 
all of its coverage to the 
president’s individual tastes, 
singularly 
aligning 
itself 
with a political figure and 
in the process transforming 
itself 
into 
an 
executive 
mouthpiece. 
 
Especially 
in a time when print news 
is 
in 
decline, 
television 
media’s preeminence in the 
information 
realm 
really 
does matter, necessitating 
honest 
and 
fact-based 
coverage by the networks 
who wield this power.
In addition to its content, 
Fox 
News’ 
interaction 
with the president further 
embodies the novelty of the 
Trump problem. While all 
news 
sources 
sometimes 
distort facts in advocating 
their political stances, the 
nature of Trump’s reliance 
on 
and 
his 
supporters’ 
subsequent 
attachment 
to, his preferential media 
sources is clearly unique. 
That the president so heavily 
feeds off of his coverage 
on Fox News—all the while 
his political brand strays 
even 
further 
from 
old 
party ways—supports this 
characterization.
Unfortunately, 
this 
alarming 
relationship 
is 
clouded by boilerplate calls 

for 
intellectual 
diversity. 
While society should always 
promote 
willingness 
to 
consider conflicting points of 
view, the seemingly magnetic 
tendency to denounce “both 
the left and right” of equally 
vile partisanship amounts 
to nothing more than false 
equivalence (which brings 
to 
mind 
a 
particularly 
misplaced 
invocation 
of 
the “both sides” narrative). 
 
Even if one could manage to 
write off several prominent 
anti-Trump 
Republicans 
jumping ship as a routine 
political shake-up, George 
Will calling for a Democratic 
takeover 
of 
Congress 
should sound some alarms. 
Listening to the other side 
does not mean ignoring signs 
that things are clearly not 
normal. 
Trump’s power to lead 
in a manner devoid of both 
caution and beneficence lies 
squarely in the constituency 
he has cultivated. Nourishing 
these new Republicans and 
steadily 
fueling 
Trump’s 
presidency – criticism of 
his decisions be damned 
– is Trump’s media corps, 
epitomized by Fox News 
and servile to the president 
insofar 
as 
its 
broadcasts 
resound through the homes 
of his devotees. This is a 
dynamic as disquieting as 
it is underappreciated, and 
it 
demands 
a 
newfound 
scrutiny of our media. In 
turn, this would promote 
greater accountability of our 
president, 
something 
that 
should be appreciated by 
Trump’s loudest supporters 
and critics alike.

Cloudy, ominous weather wel-
comed me to Pitchfork Music Fes-
tival this year, and bracing myself 
for the worst I strapped up in a 
raincoat and boots for the first day 
of the fest. But what was originally 
daunting proved simply unreliable. 
The weather circled through cloud, 
rain and shine all weekend while 
artists dealt with wet equipment 
and herds of fans waiting patiently 
in the rain to see them. But this 
erratic weather didn’t do much to 
dissuade fans. If anything, the rain 
that poured down onto us during 
the Tame Impala set Friday night 
simply made their backlit bodies 
and light show all the more spec-
tacular as beads of water could be 
seen streaming through the lights. 
A festival dominated by female-
fronted bands and artists, Pitchfork 
stands out from more mainstream 
festivals in its emphasis on female 
and queer artists, especially this 
year. The diversity of the artists, 
genre, and its celebration of small-
er names alongside bigger ones is 
what makes this festival unique; it’s 
relative tameness and inclusiveness 
of an older, less wreckless crowd 
is what makes it still exciting and 
bearable by day three. In the last 
year the festival improved upon its 
layout and welcomed more women 
than ever before, and despite last 
minute cancellations from artists 
such as Earl Sweatshirt, the festival 
carried on day after day as thou-
sands gathered in Union Park to 
celebrate music, drink excessively 

and participate in the hedonistic 
rituals that accompany music and 
those who value it more than their 
own life.
Courtney Barnett
Steve Hyden claimed in his 
recent novel that Courtney Barnett 
is the best rock song writer of our 
decade. Her lyrics and unsympa-
thetic electric guitar deliver what 
the Sex Pistols or the Rolling Stones 
did for a previous generation except 
with one noticeable difference: 
She’s a woman. And that makes her 
even fiercer. In an all black outfit 
accented by her blood red guitar, 
Barnett greeted her adoring crowd 
with the song “Hopefulessness” 
which is off her recent release 
Tell Me How You Really Feel. And 
immediately, her crowd went into a 
concentrated state of head-banging 
until the set concluded more than 
an hour later. It was as if I was 
standing on the precipice of a mosh 
pit the entire set; eagerly wanting 
to break out into a push and pull 
with other attendees, I held back. 
For while Barnett’s songs reach 
towards punk rock, they often 
hold back just a little bit and show 
restraint. This can be particularly 
heard on songs like “Charity” and 
“Small Poppies,” but becomes less 
clear on more aggressive songs like 
“Elevator Operator” and “Pedes-
trian at Best.” And perhaps this 
is what made the performance so 
thrilling. There was an element of 
unknown over what was going to 
happen next, whether the crowd 
would burst into a mosh pit of con-
tinue banging their heads along, 
holding back with every bit of 

strength so to fully take in the rock 
god Barnett has established herself 
to be.
Blood Orange
Seconds into Blood Orange’s set 
on Saturday, I gasped. The famil-
iar notes of Sky Ferierra’s “Every-
thing is Embarrassing” echoed 
through the field as Dev Hynes, 
Blood Orange’s lead singer, walked 
on stage and immediately dove into 
the 2012 hit he co-wrote with the 
punk rocker. From this, the set only 
grew exponentially better. Deliv-
ering familiar tracks like “Best to 
You” as well as hints of new music 
from their upcoming album Negro 
Swan, Hynes and his accompanying 
band put on one of the best perfor-
mances of the weekend, drawing 
in a rapturous crowd and greet-
ing cheering fans with sly smiles 
and matched energy. Closing with 
two of his biggest hits, “You’re Not 
Good Enough” and “E.V.P.” Hynes 
captivated the huge crowd that had 
gathered around the Green Stage, 
the largest stage at the festival.
Japanese Breakfast
Along with Blood Orange, Japa-
nese Breakfast was my favorite per-
formance of the weekend. Between 
their after show Saturday night at 
Thalia Hall in Chicago and the Sun-
day afternoon performance on the 
Blue Stage, Michelle Zauner cap-
tured my heart. For while Psycho-
pomp and Soft Sounds from Another 
Planet are gorgeous albums in 
their own right, hearing the songs 
performed live and watching as 
Zauner delivers them with fierce 
energy and enthusiasm not easily 
located in the recordings is a com-

pletely different thing. Yielding her 
electric guitar and egging on her 
fellow bandmates, Zauner pushed 
through hits such as “In Heaven,” 
“Everybody Wants to Love You,” 
and “Boyish” and left me in a dis-
traught state — I wasn’t sure if I 
wanted to dance or cry, so I did both 
at the same time. Closing with a 
cover of the Cranberries’ “Dreams” 
and the song “Machinist” off of 
their second studio album, Japa-
nese Breakfast left the crowd in 
awe. Zauner is a bubble of happi-
ness on stage. One wouldn’t know 
the grief that inspired and under-
cuts Psychopomp and Soft Sounds 
unless they’ve read about their 
background elsewhere (one was 
written in the wake of her mother’s 
cancer diagnosis, and the next in 
the wake of her mother’s death). 
The juxtaposition of this heaviness 
with Zauner’s lighthearted deliv-
ery is perhaps why I felt so struck 
by the band’s performances. In the 
end, it proves to be a catharsis not 
just for the crowd, but for Zauner 
too at each and every tour date.
Noname
Last September I was lucky 
enough to see Noname open for Ms. 
Lauryn Hill at the Royal Oak Music 
Theatre. At the time, it had only 
been a month since she released 
her debut studio album Telefone, 
and while it would grow to garner 
widespread praise from multiple 
critics, it only had a small follow-
ing at the time. Six months later, 
she would come to Michigan once 
again, this time headlining her own 
show at the El Club with opener 
Ravyn Lenae. By this time, her 
stint as Lauryn Hill’s opener would 
become a verse in rapper Smino’s 
song “Amphetamine”: “Said I’m 
moving too fast, slow down, slow 
down / Opened up for Lauryn 
Hill, woah now, woah now.” In 
six months she had grown from a 
small Chicago rapper featured on 
Chance the Rapper’s Acid Rap to a 
woman being called the “musical 
reincarnation of Lauryn Hill.” And 
while her music does lend itself to 
this comparison, her stage pres-
ence is much more reserved than 
the mother of modern hip hop. “I 
wanted to do one of my new songs, 
but then I smoked and forgot the 
lyrics,” the rapper said, after stop-
ping her band two minutes into the 
first song. “Do you mind if I do it a 
cappella?” She’s irresistibly charm-
ing, if untraditional in her delivery 
of her music. The set continued on 
in this vein, with her occasionally 
stopping to start a song again from 
the beginning or guiding the audi-
ence in the harmonies for a song 
from her upcoming album Room 25. 

With 20 minutes left in her set, she 
brought out guest after guest from 
Ravyn Lenae to Saba to Smino and 
while they brought a boost of ener-
gy to her reserved stage demeanor, 
she still remained the star.
(Sandy) Alex G
(Sandy) Alex G can be an ass-
hole. A primary feature of his per-
formances is often the antagonistic 
way he treats his crowd, asking for 
requests from his adoring audi-
ences and then blowing them off to 
play a hardly recognizable deep cut. 
This performance was no excep-
tion with the singer-songwriter 
barely addressing the crowd during 
his brutally short 45 minute set. But 
for some reason, I, and all the other 
fans gathered around the Blue 
Stage Sunday evening, still dwelled 
in every second he bestowed on 
us. Throwing out the melody to 
Weezer’s “Island in the Sun” dur-
ing soundcheck and then blasting 
the Rascal Flatt’s cover of “Life is 
a Highway” before taking the stage 
with his band, (Sandy) Alex G went 
right into a rendition of “Kute” and 
“Forever” before even addressing 
the audience. Strangely enough, 
Alex G played several songs off 
of Beach Music, his 2015 studio 
release, and at one point Michelle 
Zauner joined him on stage to per-
form the popular “Brite Boy,” a per-
sonal favorite of mine that hasn’t 
made a setlist at his concert in quite 
a while. And unlike the reserve fans 
showed during Courtney Barnett’s 
set on Friday, when her crowd 
remained stationary despite her 
rock songs begging for a mosh pit to 
form, the second Alex screamed the 
first lyric to his aggressive, punk-
heavy “Brick,” the crowd broke 
into a mosh pit, his dedicated fans 
throwing themselves at each other 
in a religious fervor, only stopping 
after a girl went down after get-
ting elbowed in the nose. After a 
15 song performance, the set ended 
suddenly with Alex G announcing 
that despite what he thought, there 
was no more time for another song. 
While the crowd bemoaned this 
and chanted “one more song!” Alex 
G fittingly approached the mic and 
screamed “Shut up, and thank you” 
before finally departing the stage.
Ms. Lauryn Hill
The most popular topic of dis-
cussion 
Sunday 
evening 
was 
throwing out guesses as to how 
many minutes would pass before 
Ms. Lauryn Hill would finally take 
the stage. Twenty minutes? Thirty? 
Would she come at all?

“Mamma Mia! 

Here We Go 

Again”

Rave Cinemas, 

Quality 16

Legendary 

Entertainment

If it were possible to distill 
joy into liquid form and inject 
it directly into the vein, it still 
wouldn’t be as potent or infec-
tious a high as “Mamma Mia! 
Here We Go Again.”
Stuffed to the brim with beau-
tiful people, colors, happy songs 
and bright emotions, the sequel 
to the original 2008 “Mamma 
Mia” is one of the best movie 
theater experiences you’re like-
ly to find this year, or even this 
decade. It’s two straight hours 
of cathartic emotional release, 
a swirling giddy combination of 
laughter, tears and dance.
The film opens several years 
after the first ended — Amanda 
Seyfried (“Anon”) plays Sophie, 
reeling from the death of her 
mother, Donna (Meryl Streep, 
“The Post”). Sophie’s in the pro-
cess of rebranding the Greek 
island hotel her mother owned, 
attempting to return it to its 
former glory to honor Donna’s 
memory. The modern-day story 
is intercut with flashes back to 
1979, in which we follow young 
Donna, played by Lily James 
(“Darkest Hour”), as she travels 
across Europe and has a series 
of brief, but meaningful, love 
affairs.
Every single person involved 
with making this movie is at 
their shining, brightest best. 
James turns in one of the most 
charismatic and charming per-

formances in recent memory, 
full of a vibrant young energy 
that makes it obvious why these 
three men would immediately 
fall in love with her. She’s the 
kind of actress who makes it 
nearly impossible to look away 
when she’s on-screen, dedicating 
herself with an almost reckless 
abandon to the glitter and brava-
do of this movie — as does every 
single other actor here. There’s a 
sense pervading the entire movie 
that everybody is just so happy 
to be there. And thank God they 
were, because I am 
so happy to be here 
too.
“Do what makes 
your soul shine,” 
Julie 
Walters’s 
character 
tells 
Sophie 
as 
she 
makes what seems 
like an impossible 
choice. It’s a gor-
geous mantra, one 
that’s 
entrenched 
in the bones of 
this story. Because for all the 
sparkles and spectacle, “Mamma 
Mia” shines at its heart.
I wish I could explain, in 
words, all the things I loved 
about “Mamma Mia.” If I could, 
I’d tell you about Colin Firth 
(“Kingsman: The Golden Cir-
cle”) 
and 
Stellan 
Skarsgård 
(“The Man Who Killed Don 
Quixote”) swinging their hips in 
tandem atop a boat while “Danc-
ing Queen” swells. I’d tell you 
about “Waterloo” in a French 

restaurant, and a baguette being 
used as an electric guitar. I’d tell 
you about big floppy hats and 
flowing colorful skirts, or about 
the way the chemistry between 
James and Josh Dylan (“Allied”) 
jumps clear off the screen.
If I had the words, I’d tell you 
about the world of “Mamma 
Mia,” the way it’s full of love and 
bravery, of people who live their 
lives with passion and romance, 
never (in the words of fellow 
Daily staffer Arya Naidu, who 
spent most of this movie sitting 
dead 
straight 
in 
her chair with one 
hand over her heart 
and another peri-
odically punching 
me in the arm) set-
tling for anything 
that doesn’t abso-
lutely thrill them. 
I don’t really have 
the words, though, 
because 
“Mamma 
Mia” is not a movie 
to be written about 
— it’s meant to be felt.
“Mamma Mia” operates not on 
any kind of fancy twists of sto-
rytelling mechanics, but rather 
on the rawest levels of cathar-
sis — the viewer is taken by the 
hand and whisked on a journey 
through whatever will make 
them laugh or cry the most in 
each moment. In the process, 
“Mamma Mia” develops an emo-
tional language through song 
and dance that’s clear and well-
formed. All the bombast and 

chaos is tied together by a tight 
intuitive throughline, coming 
together to create a story about 
the passions and tribulations of 
life, and all the ways love can 
hurt and heal people. It’s about 
dancing and motherhood, sex, 
joy and generations of women 
supporting and caring for each 
other.
Kim Gordon once said that 
“People pay to see others believe 
in 
themselves,”* 
and 
with 
“Mamma Mia” that’s exactly 
what we did. There’s a scene 
near the end that cuts between 
the young and newly pregnant 
Sophie singing with her mother’s 
best friends and young Donna 
giving birth to Sophie. Donna is 
all alone in a dilapidated farm-
house, until the kind older Greek 
woman who owns it comes run-
ning to her. She strokes her hair 
and helps her birth the baby that 
will grow up to be Sophie, sing-
ing on that very same island in 
tribute to her brave and beautiful 
mother — and right in that scene 
I understood that this is a movie 
about women making the choices 
to define their lives in ways that 
excite and fulfill them. They’re 
looking for love — real love, not 
the cheap stuff — and real joy, 
and this story is a celebration of 
their search as they reach just a 

little higher.
It’s about pop music, perfect 
Greek islands, sequined body 
suits and about how sometimes 
being a dancing queen means 
singing your way through a 
broken heart, performing with 
your whole body and soul for an 
empty room. It’s about (literally) 
falling into the arms of a Scan-
danavian sailor with the bluest 
eyes you’ve ever seen, about par-
ties filled with all the people you 
love most in the world. It’s about 
Cher showing up uninvited at 
the stroke of midnight, blonde 
and fabulous, and declaring that 
Sophie has “glitter in her blood.” 
 
It’s the rare movie that lifts 
your spirits from the feet up, 
never doubting the innate good-
ness of its characters or devaluing 
the sweet and corny happiness it 
brings into the world. “Mamma 
Mia” is a magical movie, full of 
moments so over the top perfect, 
so 
heart-wrenchingly 
happy 
that I couldn’t stop smiling for 
its entire runtime. It’s the kind 
of movie that makes the world 
a little bit brighter — the kind 
of movie that makes your soul 
shine.

ROBERT MANSUETTI
Summer Senior Arts Editor

The Internet is the hardest 
band to be a fan of for one simple 
reason. Not because their music 
is problematic, not because they 
make questionable career choices, 
but because of two simple words: 
their name. What’s in a name? A 
lot of social faux pas apparently. 
On more than one occasion I have 
mindlessly asked a friend “Have 
you ever heard of The Internet?” 
to recieve the blankest of stares. 
Only a few days ago I put on their 
newest album Hive Mind in the 
background while helping my 
mom prepare dinner; she asked 
me what we were listening to 
and my completely 
honest 
response 
was 
met 
with 
a 
curt 
“thanks, 
smartass.”
Yet despite their 
poor search engine 
optimization, The Internet and 
its individual members have 
been making musical tidal waves 
recently. Thankfully I can now 
type “The Internet” into Google 
and the band’s website pops up as 
the first result. Drop the “The,” 
however, and you’ll probably get 
a confused FBI agent wondering 
if the 19-year-old kid they were 
assigned to is actually a computer 
illiterate 65-year-old grandma.
Once 
described 
as 
“what 
people thought [Odd Future] was” 
by lead vocalist Syd, The Internet 
has its roots in Tyler, the Creator’s 
(seemingly 
defunct) 
hip-hop 
Sandlot. What began as Syd 
and 
percussionist/keyboardist 
Matt Martians’ side project has 
now evolved into a Grammy-
nominated group rounded out 
by the multitalents Patrick Paige 
II and Christopher Smith and 
guitarist Steve Lacy, the latter of 
whom was buzzed about last year 
for producing Kendrick Lamar’s 

“PRIDE” on his iPhone. Gaining 
steam with 2015’s breezy Ego 
Death and a healthy output of solo 
projects — Steve Lacy’s Demo, 
Syd’s Fin and Martians’ The Drum 
Chord Theory were among 2017’s 
subtle standouts — The Internet 
is a on a roll, and with their latest 
effort, only getting funkier.
When paired with Ego Death, 
Hive Mind’s title makes it seem 
like the second installment in a 
conceptual Jungian psychology 
trilogy, but don’t be mistaken. 
The album is as accessible as 
the Motown classics it follows 
in the footsteps of and rich in 
lyrical meaning and masterfully 
melded production. The band’s 
five members simply gel together, 
pooling 
their 
collective 
talent 
and 
playfully 
bouncing off each 
other to craft music 
that 
evolves 
the 
joint sound while 
retaining individual flair.
Lead single “Come Over” is a 
perfect example of the group’s 
united psyche: Lacy’s work on 
guitar and bass presents itself as 
a Super Mario 64-esque endless 
staircase of twangs and thumps, 
carpeted by Martians’ staggered 
drum patterns, all while Syd 
and her effortlessly cool vocals 
casually saunter up it. “We can 
play Simon Says / or watch TV in 
bed” implores Syd to her nameless 
Juliet in the song’s music video, as 
she stands hands-in-pockets like 
a lost Romeo on a suburban lawn. 
When Syd finally gets her crush 
to perform the titular action, 
the house literally spins around 
the camera, revealing the other 
four band members with their 
respective boos in simple, lovely 
vignettes.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Eating goes beyond taste

 Summertime, when the 
livin’ is easy.
 The perfect description 
of my time in Trinidad for 
a week of warm air, freshly 
picked 
mangoes 
and 
curried chicken. Adding 
in the wedding festivities 
with steel drums beating 
in 
the 
background 
of 
a barbeque where the 
twinkle lights hung low 
from the pink house whose 
warm yellow light glowed 
from the kitchen. White 
teeth grinning as the next 
pina colada is pouring into 
a glass and the bellowing 
laughter bouncing off the 
side of the white fence 
resting on the greenest 
grass I have ever seen. 
“Good night everyone!” 
someone bellows from the 
steps of the lit porch. 
 Trinidad and Tobago, 
much like America, were 
colonized by Christopher 
Columbus, who sought 
to exploit the people who 
had lived there as well 
as utilize the land and 
its rich soil for monetary 
gain. What you might not 
know is that these islands 
were originally inhabited 
by the indigenous Carib 
and Arawak Indians. It 
wasn’t until slavery was 
introduced that Africans 
taken from their native 
homelands were forced 
to work Trinidad’s land 
for the British whose 
slave trade started in 1797, 
and the country became 
predominantly 
African. 
It was then in 1845 that 
indentured laborers from 
India were also brought 
into the mix — bringing 
with them their religious 
customs. In 1866 laborers 
from China immigrated to 
Trinidad and merchants 
from Lebanon and Syria 
later came in the 1900s. 
Though the history is 
dark and unmistakably 
horrendous, Trinidad has 
one of the most diverse 
populations 
of 
people, 
food, festivals and holidays 
all over the world.

 Looking from the outside 
as a resident of the United 
States, I think it’s easy to 
think that America is one 
of the only places that face 
a history of exploitation 
and injustice. However, 
anyone willing to look a 
bit deeper into the history 
of 
many 
modern-day 
countries can see that 
systems 
of 
oppression 
were used to mobilize 
those who had guns in 
their hands and identified 
themselves as superior. If 
there is one thing I think 
many of us suffer from, it’s 
that we think there aren’t 
other people who share 
our experiences of being 
abused by people who had 
power, 
simply 
because 
our experiences occurred 
in a different way than 
the experiences of those 
who came before we did. 
I want to draw attention 
to the fact that there is 
much more to unite these 
atrocities 
that 
many 
of us faced than what 
creates division between 
us in America and with 
colonized countries across 
the face of the Earth.
 
Despite 
this 
terrible 
past, one of the amazing 
things that resulted from 
these atrocities is the 
food. 
Knowing 
there 
is such a rich cultural 
element 
within 
the 
country’s history, there 
is no surprise that its 
food would reflect these 
features, from the curried 
chicken served to me at 
the 
wedding 
barbeque 
to the roti I scooped up 
my collard greens with 
and 
then 
dipped 
into 
my 
sweet 
yams. 
Roti 
andcurried chicken are 
both traditionally a part 
of Indian cuisine, and 
because these dishes are 
such an integrative part 
of Trinidad and Tobago’s 
African 
heritage, 
these 
dishes reflect the history of 
India and Africa. Doubles, 
or the Caribbean street-
food 
sandwich 
made 
with a flatbread called 
bara and then filled with 
curried chickpeas, was 

one of the most popular 
foods 
that 
everyone 
raved about during my 
time in Trinidad. In fact, 
doubles are so popular in 
Trinidad that the bride 
and groom arranged for 
the “Doubles man” to 
make an appearance at 
their wedding to hand 
the delicious treat out 
to their wedding guests! 
I have to admit: Upon 
trying one, I wasn’t sure 
what I was in store for 
and I was definitely not 
disappointed.
 Trinidad and Tobago 
also have some of the 
best Chinese restaurants 
because, like their Indian 
roots, they also have a 
rich history of Chinese 
immigrants who brought 
their food over to the 
country. This is combined 
with the mangoes growing 
on every tree that were so 
juicy that if they fell from 
a tree, they would most 
likely splatter over the hot 
pavement. The cuisine of 
any country is a direct 
reflection of its history and 
culture, and Trinidad’s 
food 
is 
definitely 
an 
unforgettable experience 
that reveals how much 
history can truly affect the 
composition of a country.
 There is no doubt that 
food is a reflection of 
tradition and culture, but 
if there one is an event 
that ties together food 
and tradition, it is the 
celebration of a wedding. 
My 
family’s 
friendship 
with the groom is what 
brought 
us 
down 
to 
Trinidad in the first place, 
and getting to know the 
place where one of our 
oldest friends grew up was 
really breathtaking. Much 
of the ceremony was taken 
from traditions found here 
in America; just as we took 
from English tradition, so 
does Trinidad. However, 
some 
things 
that 
are 
unique to Trinidad were 
in the details of the 
reception.

 I remember my dad 
pulling me aside at a 
family gathering to a 
plethora of Jordanian 
food including mansaf, 
kanafeh and tabbouleh. 
As every other one of 
my 40 cousins piled food 
onto their plates, I stuck 
with the chicken tenders 
placed 
on 
the 
table 
almost entirely because 
of me. I had recently 
arrived in Jordan from 
America and definitely 
wasn’t used to the local 
cuisine. Instead, I was 
content 
with 
playing 
on my Grandpa’s swing 
with the soda I had 
snuck from the kitchen.
 I have always been 
the stubborn kid at the 
dinner table. I was a 
messy eater growing up 
and my mother even took 
me to etiquette classes. 
Along with this, I was a 
picky eater. I spent my 
adolescence being often 
told to eat my chicken 
or reminded not to play 
with my food. At an early 
age my family started 
flying me to Jordan to 
spend summers with my 
grandparents. 
Though 
I was in a different 
country, 
I 
was 
still 
constantly told at the 
dinner table not to eat 
with my hands or to try 
some of the local cuisine. 
Like most kids, I rebelled 
and often tried to sleep 
through breakfast. At 
dinnertime, I would sit 
by and fill up on tea and 
salad 
before 
running 
off to play soccer with 
my cousins in the local 
streets. To this day, I 
still do not like most 
Arabic food. However, 

just as most kids are 
taught 
to 
eat 
their 
vegetables, I was taught 
to begrudgingly eat the 
food my grandparents 
made.
 My dad, who was not 
having my whitewashed 
taste buds, picked me 
up from the swing at 
that family gathering 
and dragged me over to 
the mansaf. Mansaf is 
usually rice and lamb 
served with fermented 
dried yogurt as a type 
of sauce. As I whined 
on the way to the meal, 
I noticed everyone for 
some reason was walking 
up to the huge piping 
hot plate of mansaf had 
just been placed on the 
kitchen counter. I was 
even 
more 
surprised 
when every single person 
began picking up balls of 
rice and lamb and eating 
it with their bare hands. 
As we approached the 
plate, I was sure there 
was no way my civilized 
father would do the 
same, but he did! All of 
the Arab men who had 
nagged me for being a 
messy child were now 
eating rice with their 
bare hands. Of course, I 
immediately began to eat 
the mysterious food. And 
though I hated every 
single bite, I had a great 
time. Eating mansaf that 
day was just fun. It was 
the first time I really 
remember 
connecting 
with my culture because 
it was as childish as I 
was.
 This past summer, I 
did a study-abroad trip 
in China and had my 
first swing at chopsticks. 

Needless to say it was 
a mess and I probably 
looked 
pretty 
dumb 
to 
the 
locals 
sitting 
at the table next to 
me. 
However, 
once 
again, it was a time of 
enjoyment 
because 
I 
was trying to acclimate 
to this new cultural 
norm. 
Meanwhile, 
a 
lot of people on my trip 
asked the waiter for 
forks. The issue with 
asking for a fork in a 
Chinese restaurant for 
me is it showed a clear 
disingenuous connection 
to the process of eating. 
We went to China to eat 
an 
authentic 
Chinese 
meal, yet we were still 
trying to have little bits 
of 
America 
infiltrate 
our 
meal. 
Though 
I 
may have looked dumb 
while I learned to use 
chopsticks, it was all part 
of the fun of traveling to 
this country.
 A country’s food is 
so much more to me 
than just something to 
fill your daily intake of 
calories. Every authentic 
meal is placed on that 
menu because it holds 
some type of significance 
to that country. That day, 
my dad really taught me 
to enjoy food for more 
than just the flavor. Food 
is a piece of a country’s 
past and a telling trait 
of its people. Of course, 
nobody can like every 
single food out there. 
However, 
I 
implore 
everyone to let yourself 
taste something awful 
— because while the 
aftertaste may not be the 
best, you’re sure to feel 
better later.

SPORTS

In 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
International 
Champions 
Cup 
showdown 
between 
Manchester United and 
Liverpool, 
the 
casual 
American sports fan may 
be at a loss as to what 
to look for. As familiar 
as the venue might be —
Michigan Stadium — the 
unfolding 
events 
may 
not be as welcoming. To 
make you seem like you 
know what you’re talking 
about on Saturday, the 
Daily breaks down what 
to expect on the pitch 
and how to appreciate 
the intricacies of the 
other football.
Liverpool:
New Look Midfield:
On paper, last season’s 
starting midfield of Alex 
Oxlade-Chamberlain, 
Jordan Henderson and 
James 
Milner 
wasn’t 
one 
that 
necessarily 
looked on par with that 
of title rivals like the 
two Manchester clubs 
and European giants like 
Real Madrid.
With Milner turning 
33 next season, Emre Can 
having left for Juventus 
and 
Chamberlain 
succumbing to an ACL 
injury that ruled him 
out for part of the new 
season, manager Jurgen 
Klopp 
desperately 
needed 
to 
find 
reinforcements.
The signing of Naby 
Keita 
from 
Red 
Bull 
Leipzig was tied up last 
year. The dynamic box-
to-box midfielder and 
Klopp’s style of football 
appear a match made in 
football heaven. With 
an impressive range of 
vision, a tireless work 
ethic and an eye for 
goals, the Guinea captain 
will 
provide 
a 
spark 
from the heart of the 
midfield that Liverpool 
desperately needed since 
Chamberlain’s injury.
Fabinho was signed 
from 
Monaco 
this 
transfer 
window. 
The 
all-action 
defensive 
midfielder 
played 
an 
integral role in guiding 
Monaco to the 2016-17 

Ligue 1 title over PSG. 
He will provide much 
needed defensive cover 
in front of the Liverpool 
backline 
which 
was 
the 
Merseyside 
club’s 
Achilles heel last season, 
Keeper included.
Both 
new 
signings 
should be on display 
Saturday, 
playing 
in 
their first derby against 
Manchester United.
Attacking 
Reinforcements:
Defenders 
across 
Europe shook in their 
expensive 
cleats 
at 
the thought of playing 
against Mohamed Salah, 
Sadio Mane and Roberto 
Firmino. Only Cristiano 
Ronaldo had more goals 
than the three in the 
Champions League, and 
it 
took 
Lionel 
Messi 
to keep the European 
Golden Boot away from 
Salah. Not bad company 
to sit behind.
But 
when 
Salah 
got subbed off in the 
Champions 
League 
Final with a shoulder 
injury, 
Liverpool’s 
ferociousness 
left 
the 
pitch 
with 
him. 
No 
substitute looked close 
to giving Liverpool the 
extra gear they needed 
that night in Kiev.
Daniel Sturridge was 
once Liverpool’s second 
best striker in the days 
of Luis Suarez. A plague 
of injuries and bad form 
had all but threatened 
to 
end 
his 
Anfield 
career. 
Three 
goals 
thus far in pre-season 
have Sturridge looking 

sharper than he has in 
months, as he looks to 
fight for his place in the 
squad.
Backups 
Dominic 
Solanke 
and 
Divok 
Origi haven’t inspired 
confidence 
during 
pre-season. 
As 
such, 
Liverpool 
signed 
Xherdan 
Shaqiri, 
Switzerland’s 
standout 
performer over the last 
two World Cups. They 
signed him for £13.5 
million following Stoke 
City’s relegation. Should 
his 
World 
Cup 
form 
carry 
over, 
he 
could 
give Klopp a welcomed 
selection headache.
Shaqiri, 
Sturridge, 
Solanke and Origi will 
all be looking to make 
a case for themselves 
before the start of next 
season. What better way 
to impress your manager 
than by scoring against 
your 
club’s 
eternal 
rivals?
Formation Changes:
Liverpool 
played 
in 
a 
free-flowing 
4-3-3 
formation for most of 
last year. Following the 
injury to Alex Oxlade-
Chamberlain, 
however, 
Klopp 
occasionally 
played a 4-2-3-1, with 
Solanke sitting ahead of 
Firmino who played in a 
deeper, more traditional 
No.10 role.
Klopp 
has 
tinkered 
with 
this 
formation 
throughout 
the 
pre-
season as well, especially 
given Naby Keita and 
Fabinhio’s proficiency in 
the two midfield roles. 

Teenage 
forward 
Ben 
Woodburn has looked 
promising as well and 
could 
be 
given 
more 
game time to develop.
Expect more tactical 
changes this weekend 
as Klopp tinkers with 
Liverpool’s 
formation 
and personnel, looking 
to get his squad ready for 
the start of the Premier 
League season.
Manchester United:
Alexis Sanchez:
Manchester 
United 
orchestrated 
a 
coup 
with 
the 
signing 
of 
Arsenal’s star forward, 
Alexis Sanchez, getting 
him 
in 
exchange 
for 
want-away 
midfielder 
Henrikh 
Mkhitaryan. 
Fast forward six months, 
and it seems Arsenal got 
the better deal.
Sanchez’s talent and 
work ethic are beyond 
question, but for some 
reason he never quite fit 
in to Jose Mourinho’s 
tactical setup. Flashes 
of 
brilliance 
were 
overshadowed 
by 
subdued 
appearances. 
Relentless 
inconsistencies perfectly 
embody 
Sanchez’s 
career.
However, following a 
full preseason with his 
new team, Sanchez looks 
more comfortable in his 
new surroundings. His 
first two games have 
been 
promising, 
and 
playing 
against 
club 
rival 
Liverpool 
could 
see a big game out of the 
Chilean.
United 
fans 
should 

be licking their lips at 
the prospect of seeing 
Sanchez 
linkup 
with 
Paul Pogba and Romelu 
Lukaku next season.
New 
signing: 
Frederico Rodrigues de 
Paula Santos (Fred):
With 
a 
midfield 
compromised 
of 
Paul 
Pogba, 
Marouane 
Fellaini 
and 
Nemanja 
Matic, Mourinho has a 
contingent of physically 
strong 
midfield 
enforcers. Standing at 5 
feet and 7 inches, Fred 
provides a different kind 
of player.
Quick and agile off his 
feet with a sharp passing 
range, Fred provides a 
more creative outlet to 
Manchester United, one 
that it sorely lacked last 
season, 
often 
looking 
bereft 
of 
creativity. 
Adept 
at 
starting 
counter-attacks 
and 
unlocking defenses, the 
Brazilian should make 
Manchester 
United 
a 
more exciting outfit next 
season.
Fred is also versatile 
in that, despite being 
labeled 
an 
offensive 
conductor, he was also 
FC Shakhtar Donetsk’s 
top tackler last season. 
He 
can 
easily 
fit 
alongside Matic in a 
defensive 
midfield 
position allowing Pogba 
the freedom to venture 
further up-field where 
the Frenchman thrives.
Having been an unused 
part of Brazil’s World 
Cup squad, Fred should 
be looking to stretch his 

legs and impress during 
any game time he sees 
this summer, especially 
against Liverpool.
The curious case of 
Anthony Martial:
Since 
sending 
Old 
Trafford into raptures 
on his debut with a 
goal against Liverpool, 
Anthony 
Martial’s 
career has seen vertigo 
inducing 
highs 
and 
damning lows.
A stellar first season 
with the club saw him 
labeled as the future of 
the club. An indifferent 
second year saw him left 
out of France’s world 
cup winning squad and 
overlooked in favor of 
younger, more promising 
talent.
Just 22 and unhappy 
with 
not 
being 
guaranteed 
a 
starting 
spot, Martial could be 
looking for new pastures. 
With 
Bayern 
Munich 
and Chelsea reportedly 
interested, he could soon 
be leaving Manchester 
United.
Jose 
Mourinho, 
however, would rather 
not lose a player of 
his 
caliber, 
especially 
considering 
fellow 
forwards 
Marcus 
Rashford 
and 
Romelu 
Lukaku may not be fully 
fit following long World 
Cup campaigns.
Martial 
could 
be 
playing 
for 
his 
Manchester 
United 
future 
on 
Saturday, 
or 
auditioning 
for 
a 
new club that would 
more than welcome his 
signing.
***
On Saturday, whether 
or not you know how to 
pronounce the players’ 
names or the storied 
past 
of 
Manchester 
United and Liverpool, 
the matchup will surely 
be something to behold. 
But as with all sporting 
events, the more you 
know heading in, the 
richer the experience. 
And as soccer slowly 
gains popularity in the 
states, there’s no doubt 
a spectacle of this size 
will create some new 
fans of the most popular 
sport in the world.

Two soccer titans matchup at ‘M’

Manchester 
United 
and 
Liverpool, 
the 
two 
most 
successful English football clubs, 
are set to play each other this 
Saturday at Michigan Stadium. 
With a combined 38 league titles 
and eight Champions League 
crowns 
between 
them, 
the 
significance of the derby can’t be 
understated. It’s only fitting that 
America’s largest stage will host 
two of the world’s largest clubs.
Upon winning the Europa 
League in 2017, Manchester 
United 
officially 
became 
England’s 
most 
decorated 
club with 42 major honors to 
Liverpool’s 41 — United’s 20 
league titles to its rival’s 18 only 
strengthen its case. Liverpool 
fans 
will 
argue 
their 
five 
Champions League victories to 
United’s three grant their club 
superiority. The margins are 
thin.
The 
Merseyside 
club 
can 
claim to have one of the world’s 
best players in winger Mohamed 
Salah, 
while 
Manchester 
United’s midfield is marshalled 
by newly-minted World Cup 
winner Paul Pogba, who scored 
past Liverpool defender Dejan 
Lovren at the showpiece event 
in Moscow.
Forward Marcus Rashford’s 
brace put Liverpool to the sword 
the last time the two footballing 
juggernauts 
met 
in 
their 

200thofficial meeting. However, 
the Manchester club is currently 
without Pogba, Rashford, striker 
Romelu Lukaku and a number of 
its starters who are on holiday 
after making deep runs in the 
World Cup.
Star forward Alexis Sanchez 
should provide relief to the 
depleted United squad. Anthony 
Martial, left out of the French 
team for the World Cup, is 
available and fighting for a 
starting role at Old Trafford 
next season, provided another 
club doesn’t sign him during the 
transfer window.
Liverpool 
manager 
Jurgen 
Klopp has had an eventful 
summer, having bolstered his 
midfield by acquiring stand-out 
performers from the Bundesliga 
and Ligue 1, Naby Keita and 
Fabinho, respectively. Xerdan 
Shaqiri has also been brought in 
to provide support for Salah and 
Sadio Mane on the Wings.
Liverpool’s 
headline 
singing has been that of Brazil 
goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who 
is set to take over the No.1 spot 
from Loris Karius. Karius has 
looked out of sorts in pre-season, 
carrying on his horrid form since 
the Champions League Final in 
Kyiv. He is, however, expected 
to start, with Alisson not having 
joined the squad following the 
World Cup as of now.
Despite the overall head-to-
head favoring of Manchester 
United with 80 wins, 55 draws 

and 65 loses, manager Jose 
Mourinho has a worse record 
against Klopp than any other 
manager—barring 
Josep 
Guardiola of Manchester City.
The game is not only between 
two 
legendary 
clubs, 
but 
also 
between 
two 
different 
footballing 
philosophies. 
Klopp’s brand of “heavy-metal 
football” 
with 
its 
relentless 
pressing 
and 
a 
free-flowing 
attack lays in stark contrast to 
Mourinho’s brand of pragmatic 
football where his team grinds 
out results at all costs. Some 
argue Klopp’s football is more 
fun, 
but 
Mourinho’s 
trophy 
cabinet would beg to differ.
Manchester United finished 
six points ahead of its rival in 
the Premier League title on the 
back of conceding 10 less goals, 
but Liverpool made it to the 
Champions League final behind 
Salah’s brilliance and the club’s 
fearsome attack. There is very 
little to give between these two 
great sides, and flares are sure to 
fly every time they meet — even 
in a pre-season friendly match.
The Big House is no stranger 
to rivalries. Michigan vs Ohio 
State, Michigan State and Notre 
Dame have all been played 
countless times, be it under the 
sun or under the lights. Now, it 
will be the setting for another 
chapter in the storied rivalry 
of 
Manchester 
United 
and 
Liverpool.

Four-star recruit flips to 
Stanford from Michigan

On July 23rd, four-star weakside 
defensive end Stephen Herron 
went public with his decision 
to flip his commitment from 
Michigan to Stanford — a move 
that devastated the Wolverines, 
as Herron was ranked fifth at his 
position and 86th overall.
With 
the 
loss 
of 
Herron, 
Michigan’s 2019 recruiting class 
fell to eighth in the nation and 
second in the Big Ten just behind 
Ohio State. The Wolverines saw 
themselves ranked as high as third 
overall after a highly successful 
recruiting period in late-June.
For Herron, the decision was 
purely based on academics. While 
Michigan boasts a world-renown 
reputation and an elite education, 
the recruit couldn’t turn down the 
opportunity to be a Cardinal and 
study at Stanford.
That’s why the minute he 
received that acceptance letter to 
head out west, Herron’s mind was 
made.
“For me, it’s not just football,” 
Herron 
told 
WolverinesWire. 
“I didn’t think I could pass up a 
Stanford education. I realize that 
a Michigan education isn’t far 
off, but the fact of the matter is a 
Stanford education would mean a 
lot.”
After 
committing 
to 
the 
Wolverines, it all came down to 
whether or not Herron would gain 
acceptance to be a Cardinal to 
determine where he would finally 
end up. En route to his placement 
on the west coast, Herron was 
tasked with writing seven essays 
as part of the admissions process, 
a gruelling endeavor that he took 
as seriously as his football career.
Whether 
via 
his 
public 
statements or actions in dealing 
with the team, it’s apparent that 
Herron has nothing but respect 
for Michigan and his decision has 
nothing to do with the Wolverines’ 
program or recruiting process.
“I loved the family factor (at 
Michigan),” Herron said. “Even 
after I told the coaches, I went 
in our group chat and told the 
other 2019 commits that I would 
be decommitting and wished the 
best for everyone. I hope the best 

for those guys and the coaching 
staff. I’m really excited (for them). 
Being a part of that family was 
great.”
This news comes as a relief to 
Wolverine personnel and fans 
alike after questions were raised 
over the efficacy and personability 
of Michigan’s recruiting process.
Earlier this offseason, fire-star 
offensive lineman Devontae Dobbs 
committed to Michigan State 
and wasn’t one to mince words in 
regards to his interactions with 
the Wolverines on the recruiting 
trail.
Dobbs stated that the coaching 
staff, “acted like robots,” during 
his recruiting process and that 
the Spartans’ personnel was much 
more accomodating and friendlier.
“They (MSU coaches) let it 
come naturally,” Dobbs said. “I 
just felt comfortable with them.”
His 
comments 
insinuate 
a 
lack of awareness on behalf of 
the Wolverines, although this 
coaching staff has the same man 
who famously spent the night at 
a recruit’s home in a full-hearted 
pitch to get him to come to Ann 
Arbor.
While some may see Herron’s 
flipped commitment and Dobbs’ 
comments as reason to doubt 
Michigan’s capacity for retaining 
high-level 
recruits, 
Herron’s 
respect for the program and a 
still-stacked 2019 recruiting class 
beg to differ.
Additionally, 
while 
citing 
academics as his main impetus for 
leaving Michigan, this was also a 
football decision for Herron.
“I feel like Stanford fit me 
better for play style with pass 
rushing. I want to be somewhere 
where I’m not used, and I’m not 
saying Michigan was ever going 
to do that. Rashan Gary, Chase 
Winovich and Taco Charlton, who 
the staff compared me to, are all 
doing just fine.
“I just wanted to be used where 
I would fit best as an individual for 
my future.”
While the Wolverines may 
not have been Herron’s best fit, 
Michigan will press on in its 
hunt for the nation’s best talent, 
and with any luck, it will get 
its recruits to adhere to their 
commitments going forward.

John 
Beilein’s 
contract 
extension, announced by the 
University on Wednesday, will 
see the men’s basketball coach 
paid $3.8 million annually.
The extension, which will keep 
Beilein in Ann Arbor through 
the 2022-23 season, amounts to 
a raise of roughly $400,000 per 
season. This maintains Beilein 
as 
the 
second-highest-paid 
coach based on annual salary 
in the Big Ten behind Michigan 
State’s Tom Izzo. It comes just 
weeks after Beilein’s flirtation 
with the Detroit Pistons — a 
job that ultimately went to 
former Toronto Raptors coach 
Dwane Casey.
In his 11 seasons at Michigan, 
Beilein 
boasts 
a 
248-143 
record, including eight NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances. 
He led the Wolverines to 
the Final Four and National 
Championship Game in both 
2013 and 2018, the most recent 
of which made an extension all 
but inevitable. Beilein heads 
into the 2018-19 campaign 
with 799 career wins in college 
basketball — starting at Erie 
Community College and, likely, 
ending in Ann Arbor.
The 
contract, 
obtained 
by 
The Daily, via a Freedom of 
Information 
Act 
request, 

establishes 
a 
$400,000 
base salary for Beilein with 
$1.9 
million 
in 
additional 
compensation 
and 
$1.5 
million 
being 
put 
into 
a 
403(b) Supplemental Defined 
Contribution Retirement Plan. 
Officially, it’s not a lifetime 
contract, but it is in all but 
name — and the Wolverines are 
selling it to recruits as such.
Beilein 
will 
also 
receive 
$25,000 in bonuses for each 
NCAA game won, along with 
another $25,000 for an NCAA 
Tournament berth, a Big Ten 
Tournament championship or 
a share of the Big Ten regular 
season title. If Michigan wins 
the Big Ten outright, his bonus 
jumps to $50,000.
Beilein’s buyout is $3 million 
if fired this upcoming season 
and drops to $2 million in 
2019-20. From there, it drops 
by $500,000 each year until 
the 
2022-23 
season, 
after 
which Michigan can terminate 
Beilein’s 
contract 
without 
worrying about a buyout.
Among 
other 
benefits: 
Beilein will be reimbursed 
for 
first-class 
airfare 
and 
will be entitled to 10 hours of 
private air travel within the 
continental United States per 
year. Those hours roll over for 
an additional year if unused. 
Also included are six season 
tickets to Michigan football 
games and eight such tickets to 
basketball games.

Michigan assistant coach Luke Yaklich lends his insight on the Jordan Poole, the talented new freshman team and more

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
SPORTS

In years past, the Michigan 
basketball team operated under the 
mantra “The best defense is a good 
offense.” They suffocated opposing 
defenses 
with 
their 
3-point 
shooting, but their own defense 
sometimes held them back. Last 
season, though, the Wolverines 
flipped the script. They ranked 
third in the country in Adjusted 
Defense, according to KenPom.
com. That was largely thanks to 
new assistant Luke Yaklich from 
Illinois State.
Under Yaklich, younger players 
like 
sophomore 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson developed into defensive 
stalwarts, but even junior forward 
Moritz 
Wagner 
and 
fifth-year 
senior wing Duncan Robinson — 
veterans whose defensive presence 
was 
previously 
almost 
non-
existent — vastly improved. With 
a down year for the offense, the 
new defensive mindset helped lead 
Michigan to the national title game.
Yaklich, 
meanwhile, 
is 
just 
getting started, and this year he will 
have the country’s No. 8 recruiting 
class to work with.
“Our entire coaching staff, it’s a 
great learning environment every 
day. And then obviously learning 
from our players what Michigan is 
all about, the culture. (The players 
are) 100 percent invested in that. 
They helped me … just showed me 
what Michigan basketball is about. 
That was a huge part of my own 
growth.”
Now, it’s a symbiotic relationship. 
The players come excited to learn, 

making Yaklich’s job much easier. 
And the culture that Beilein and the 
players built up was unparalleled.
“Integrity (and) accountability 
are two of our core values. We live 
those out every day,” Yaklich said. 
“… When it’s part of your culture, 
it’s part of your behavior, and that’s 
again, our focus each and every 
day.”
On his relationship with Colin 
Castleton
Incoming freshman center Colin 
Castleton didn’t originally draw 
a lot of college interest. But one of 
the first schools that contacted him 
was Illinois State — an effort led by 
Yaklich. When Yaklich joined the 
Wolverines, he continued contact 
with Castleton. Now, at Michigan, 
the two will be reunited.
“When I got to Michigan, 
(Castleton) built himself up to that 
point where he was something we 
needed,” Yaklich said. “We just 
struck up that relationship again 
and started right where we left off. 
It’s been fun following him through 
that process.”
Castleton will compete with 
junior Jon Teske and redshirt 
sophomore 
Austin 
Davis 
for 
minutes at the center position.
On the development of the 
underclassmen
The Wolverines’ run to the title 
game was largely led by veterans — 
from Wagner to Robinson to senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-
Rahkman. But from freshman 
guard Jordan Poole’s buzzer-beater 
to propel Michigan to the Sweet 

Sixteen to redshirt sophomore 
guard Charles Matthew earning the 
West Region’s Most Outstanding 
Player award, the underclassmen 
showed that the Wolverines’ future 
is bright.
“They’ve 
learned 
from 
(Robinson, Wagner and Abdur-
Rahkman),” Yaklich said. “ … It’s a 
pleasure seeing their growth from 
last year to this year. (They’re) all 
veterans in their own little ways. 
A lot of it is their approach to the 
game and understanding what it 
took to do what we did last year, 
and the role our seniors had in that. 
They want to have the same type of 
goal, leadership style and legacy.”
On Jordan Poole
Everyone remembers Poole for 
his buzzer-beater against Houston 
and his viral video set to Drake’s 
“In My Feelings.” But entering his 
sophomore year, Poole has a whole 
career ahead of him. With the 
graduation 
of 
Abdur-Rahkman, 
Poole will have the opportunity 
to step up — not just in the role of 
shooting guard, but aslso as one of 
the team’s leaders.
“A lot of fans outside the 
stadium see the dance moves and 
the smiley face, but behind it is 
a really competitive player that 
comes out every day and wants to 
be a leader,” Yaklich said. “That is 
the fun part about Jordan Poole. 
He’s comfortable in his own skin, 
but he’s a leader, wants Michigan 
to be really good and is working to 
improve himself in the process.
“He’s a special player.”
