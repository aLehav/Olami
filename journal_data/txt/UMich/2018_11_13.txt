In honor of Veterans Day, 

the Ford School of Public 
Policy at the University of 

Michigan hosted a panel event 
Monday night to discuss the 
implications of public policy 
for veterans. The panel, titled 
“The U.S. at ‘Endless War’: 
Public 
Policy 
and 
Those 

Who Serve,” featured three 

veterans and was moderated 
by associate professor Luke 
Shaefer, director of Poverty 
Solutions. The event followed 
the 
University’s 
Veterans 

Week, a week-long series 
of events intending to honor 

former 
members 
of 
the 

military.

In front of an audience 

of 
about 
100 
students, 

faculty 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents, Shaefer directed 

The San Francisco Opera 

has dropped David Daniels, 
professor at the University 
of Michigan School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance and a world-
renowned 
countertenor 

singer, 
from 
their 
2019 

production of “Orlando” amid 
sexual assault allegations and 
lawsuit filed by a student at 
the University against him. 
The 
opera 
cited 
business 

and 
professional 
reasons 

for letting go of Daniels in 
their press release announced 
last Thursday.

The 
release 
stated 
the 

decision was made “after 
considerable 
deliberation 

given the serious allegations 
of sexual assault, an ongoing 
police investigation and a 
lawsuit 
filed 
against 
the 

American opera singer.” 

“While 
these 
situations 

remain under investigation, 
San Francisco Opera is unable 
to present the artist on the 
War Memorial Opera House 
stage,” the release read.

Daniels 
also 
had 
a 

performance from the Detroit 
Symphony Orchestra pulled 
shortly after the lawsuit was 
filed in October 2018.

The 
allegations 
began 

in March 2018, when an 
anonymous student reported 
Daniels’s 
solicitation 
for 

sexual favors on Grindr. The 
student filed a complaint with 
the Office of Institutional 
Equity two days later. In July 
2018, baritone singer Samuel 
Schultz accused Daniels and 
Daniels’s 
husband, 
Scott 

Walters, of a sexual assault 
that allegedly occurred in 
2010. Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior 
Samuel 
Kidd 
then 

reported a solicitation from 
Daniels on Grindr later in 
July. In October 2018, Music, 
Theatre & Dance student 
Andrew Lipian filed a lawsuit 
accusing Daniels of sexually 
assaulting 
him 
earlier 
in 

March 2017.

After the reports of Grindr 

solicitation were first made 
to OIE, Daniels still made 
tenure at the University in 
May 2018 despite a brief OIE 
inquiry. Daniels has been on 
leave since August, and the 
University’s 
actions 
have 

been in question because of 
their knowledge of multiple 
reports since July. He is 
currently under investigation.

Lipian’s 
lawsuit 
alleges 

that on March 24, 2017, 
Daniels 
invited 
Lipian 
to 

his apartment to watch TV 
and discuss his career, and 
then drugged and assaulted 
Lipian. Lipian reported not 
being contacted by OIE for 
a 
University 
investigation.

Students turn to ‘U’, third parties 
for scheduling assistance tools

To make scheduling easy, students look for grade distributions, calendar apps

As the winter semester at 

the University of Michigan 
draws 
near, 
students 
have 

begun scheduling, turning to 
course registration tools to help 
plan their upcoming semester. 
One of these newest resources 
students have begun utilizing 
is Coursicle, which works with 
students to create a schedule 
for the upcoming term by 
allowing instant class filtering, 
visual schedule planning and 
notifying them when seats 
open up in a certain class. At 
the University, Coursicle has 
recently gained traction with 
about 
500 
current 
student 

users.

Co-founder 
Joe 
Puccio 

created Coursicle during his 
freshman year at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill after struggling to register 
for courses he needed. He 
explained how the frustration 
of planning out which classes to 
take and then not getting all the 
ones he needed inspired him to 
write the program in 2012.

“When I was an incoming 

freshman at UNC Chapel Hill, 
I spent 7 hours trying to plan 
my class schedule,” Puccio 
said. “Then finally when I went 
to actually register for those 
classes I only got to one out of 
the 5 that I needed to take. That 
night I started working on a 
program that would notify me 
when a class I wanted had an 

open seat and one of my friends 
suggested opening it up to other 
students, so we did that and it 
started growing really quickly.”

Coursicle 
was 
unique 
to 

UNC-Chapel 
Hill 
for 
its 

first three years but began 
expanding to other schools 
by late 2015. During its first 
semester, Puccio said the tool 
had 900 users and by the next 
semester, the total doubled 
to 1,800 users. UNC-Chapel 
Hill offered its support to 
Coursicle and after becoming 
partnered with the Information 
Technology Department, nearly 
80 percent of students use it to 
plan their class schedule. Puccio 
explained the Coursicle team 
was encouraged to branch out 
to different universities after 

receiving emails and Facebook 
messages from students across 
the country. 

“Originally we were just at 

UNC, so we only had UNC’s 
classes on Coursicle, but we 
had 
started 
getting 
some 

emails from other students and 
FB messages at other schools 
asking if we could add support 
for 
other 
schools,” 
Puccio 

said. “So we started playing 
around with that idea and then 
at the end of 2015 we started 
expanding to other schools.”

team

The 
American 
Civil 

Liberties Union of Michigan 
is fighting back against a new 
city ordinance that bans any 
unauthorized displays of the 
city’s seal or flag.

 In a three-page letter to 

the city dated Nov. 1, Dan 
Korobkin, 
deputy 
legal 

director 
for 
the 
ACLU’s 

Michigan 
chapter, 
and 

Gayle 
Rosen, 
co-chair 
of 

the 
Washtenaw 
County 

ACLU Lawyers Committee, 
called 
the 
ordinance 

unconstitutional 
on 
the 

grounds of free speech.

 “We strongly urge the 

city to repeal the ordinance, 
and in the meantime the 
city attorney’s office should 
disclaim 
any 
intent 
to 

enforce it,” they wrote. “Such 
a 
restriction 
is 
clearly 

unconstitutional.”

Under 
the 
ordinance, 

which City Council passed 
during its July 2 meeting, any 
displays “on any written or 
printed materials that are not 
official city publications,” are 
forbidden without explicit 
permission from the mayor. 
Violations of the ordinance 
are punishable by fines of up 

to $10,000.

In a memo to the council 

supporting the passage of 
the 
ordinance, 
Matthew 

Rechtien, 
senior 
assistant 

city 
attorney, 
explained 

the reasoning behind it. He 
claimed 
the 
unauthorized 

use of these symbols led 
to 
documents 
originating 

from 
third 
parties 
being 

misconstrued as being from 
the city.

“The city’s flag and seal are 

symbols of, and have value 
to, the city,” Rechtien wrote. 
“Vendors 
and 
potential 

vendors to the city, and other 
third-parties, however, use 

these symbols for things 
like proposals or bids to 
the city, usually without 
any city permission.”

The ordinance was 

enforced shortly after 
it 
was 
passed 
when 

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Ed Vielmetti was sent 
a “cease and desist” 
notice when he used the 
city seal in a localwiki.
org entry specifically 
about the seal.

The ACLU is arguing 

the ordinance infringes 
on free speech. While 
Vielmetti 
has 
since 

been given permission 
from the mayor to use 
the seal, the ACLU still 
sees the ordinance as an 
issue.

 “No one else who 

wishes 
to 
display 

the city’s seal or flag 
should have to risk a 
threatening letter from 
a public official, or ask 
the mayor’s permission, 
before 
engaging 
in 

speech 
or 
expression 

that is clearly protected 

by the First Amendment,” the 
ACLU letter states, referring 
to Vielmetti’s situation.

The letter was addressed 

to 
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor and City 
Attorney Stephen Postema, 
and both have responded 
saying they are going to look 
at the ordinance and make 
sure they are within their 
rights.

“Certainly I have all the 

respect in the world for the 
outstanding work performed 
by the ACLU,” Taylor said. 
“After the ACLU’s letter, we 
are going to take a very close 
look at what we have and 
make sure that we’ve got it 
right.”

In the letter, Korobkin and 

Rosen 
communicate 
they 

do not think any ordinance 
like 
the 
one 
passed 
in 

July would pass a test of 
constitutionality.

“As 
a 
content-based 

restriction on speech, the 
ordinance is subject to strict 
scrutiny and cannot survive 
that 
rigorous 
test,” 
the 

letter states. “And requiring 
the mayor’s permission to 
display the seal or flag is a 
classic unconstitutional prior 
restraint on speech.”

According 
to 
Postema, 

the city plans to discuss the 
ordinance with the council 
in December, and strike a 
balance between protecting 
the 
city’s 
interests 
and 

addressing the concerns of 
the ACLU.

JULIA LAUER/Daily

Ordinance passed in July allows up to $10,000 in fines for unauthorized 
use of City’s seal to prevent false implications of affiliation with City


questions to Public Policy 
graduate 
student 
Heath 

Bergmann, 
a 
captain 
in 

the U.S. Army, Chemistry 
chief 
administrator 
Jan 

Malaikal, 
a 
retired 
U.S. 

Army lieutenant colonel and 
Troy Nienberg, legislative 
director for U.S. Rep. Dan 
Kildee, D-Mich. and an Air 
National Guard officer.

The event was organized 

in part by lecturer Stephanie 
Sanders, the Public Policy 
School’s Diversity, Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
officer. 

Sanders said she felt it is 
important for citizens to 
understand 
how 
policy 

affects 
those 
who 
have 

served in our country.

“I think because if we want 

to think about recruiting 
and retaining veterans for 
workforce 
development 

in 
our 
organization, 
it’s 

important 
for 
those 
of 

us in the organization to 
understand where veterans 
come from,” Sanders said.

After a brief introduction 

by Public Policy School Dean 
Michael Barr, veterans were 
asked questions regarding 
their time in active duty as 
well as their transition back 
to civilian life. Bergmann, 
Malaikal and Nienberg all 
agreed though there are 
decent support systems for 
veterans currently in place, 
there could be more done 
to give more people access 
to resources after serving. 
Though 
most 
veterans 

receive benefits from the 
government 
after 
being 

discharged 
related 
to 

housing, health care and 
education, the panelists said 
local communities and close 
friends and family play a 
crucial role in facilitating a 
veteran’s transition back to 
civilian life.

A central topic of the 

discussion was the stigma 
surrounding 
the 
concept 

of 
post-traumatic 
stress 

disorder. 
The 
panelists 

said 
veterans 
who 
have 

experienced combat often 
struggle to cope with these 
memories 
once 
they’ve 

returned home, but Malaikal 
said she doesn’t want people 
to call this a “disorder.”

“We expose our veterans 

to all kinds of abnormal 
circumstances, and they’re 
reacting normally,” Malaikal 
said. “They’re reacting in 
ways that someone who has 
seen extreme violence and 
destruction would react.”

Instead 
of 
making 

veterans 
feel 
like 
their 

reactions 
are 
somehow 

abnormal 
or 
unjustified, 

Malaikal 
suggested 
the 

term PTSD be renamed so 
the term doesn’t connote 
negativity. 

Speaking on the same 

subject, Nienberg discussed 
how 
he 
channeled 
his 

experiences in combat into a 
positive learning experience 
after hearing Secretary of 
Defense James Mattis refer 
to a veteran’s experience as 
“post-traumatic growth.”

Nienberg said veterans are 

able to transfer the emotional 
stress 
from 
combat 
into 

positive empathy at home.

Radesky, a pediatrician, and her 
team found after analyzing 135 
of the most popular free and paid 
apps for children 5 years old and 
younger. She began the project 
with the goal of simply analyzing 
the prevalence and structure of 
childhood apps when she became 
concerned about the advertising 
content and its impact on the 
audience of children. The team 
had researchers explore the apps 
and evaluate their advertisements 
in categories such as pop-up 
ad videos, in-app purchases or 
prompts to rate the app.

 
“The 
reason 
I 
care 

about it as a developmental 
behavioral pediatrician is the 
distraction caused by advertising 
in apps can lead to a less 
meaningful experience when a 
child is engaging with the app,” 
Radesky said. “I am not only 
concerned about the distracting 
nature of ads, but we also found 
ads that are inappropriate for 
children.”

Radesky 
said 
the 
study 

uncovered potentially unethical 
advertising for young children, 
as children ages six to eight 
may not be able to recognize 
and distinguish advertisements 
from the app itself. According to 
Radesky, those concepts are too 
abstract for children of that age 
to understand. In their analysis, 
the team tracked advertising that 
manipulated children to tap or 
download certain programs and 
collected data from the device.

“I think the majority of apps on 

the market for young kids are not 
going to be helpful, necessarily,” 
Radesky said. “Most of them have 

not been proven to be educational 
even 
if 
they 
are 
labeled 

educational. It winds up becoming 
not helpful (to the child) and in 
some cases potentially harmful.”

They 
also 
noticed 
some 

advertisements in apps that were 
not 
age-appropriate, 
including 

violent of political ads, potentially 
doing damage to the child. While 
many apps are categorized as 
educational, Radesky said apps 
could actually introduce children 
to unexpected content.

LSA junior Kendra Nash, a 

psychology student who works in 
a school with young children, has 
concerns about the influence of 
inappropriate advertisements on 
children.

“Screens 
are 
becoming 
a 

pseudo-babysitter 
for 
many 

children and they can have 
harmful 
side 
effects,” 
Nash 

said. “This is especially an issue 
because phones store information 
and display ads that might be 
appropriate for adults, but not for 
the children who are using their 
parents’ phones.”

Nash spent her summer working 

in an autism center that advocated 
for technology use. She said with 
YouTube becoming increasingly 
popular for kids, limiting their 
exposure to inappropriate content 
is difficult.

“The autism center I worked at 

… allowed and even encouraged 
the children as young as four to 
use phones,” Nash said. “The staff 
were basically told that we can’t 
restrict their access to videos at 
camp because they have access 
to it at home and we can’t disrupt 
their routines.”

Radesky noted there are some 

well-crafted apps developed for 
children, such as the apps for 
Sesame Street and PBS Kids, but 
many are not free. She categorized 

most apps as “gamified play 
experience” and said children can 
have better experiences in the real 
world.

“What I do find with many of 

my patients is the parents let the 
child download what they want,” 
Radesky said. “Our study suggests 
that could lead to a lot of low-
quality free apps that collect data 
from the device or bombard the 
child with lots of advertisements.”

Radesky said it’s possible the 

advertising elements in apps can 
impose a high cognitive load on 
children when they pay attention 
to fast-paced media. According 
to Radesky, children struggle to 
focus and have lower executive 
functioning and impulse control 
after consumption of this type of 
media.

LSA junior Marisa Meyer joined 

Radesky’s study as a research 
assistant because she wanted to 
better understand and improve 
childhood media.

“There’s 
a 
widespread 

acceptance of children’s apps, 
without a real understanding 
of 
what’s 
included 
in 
these 

apps,” Meyer wrote in an email 
interview. “I was interested in 
learning more about its presence 
in early childhood, and wanted 
to contribute to a study that can 
help improve children’s media 
environment.”

Meyer said children use mobile 

devices for about one hour per day, 
on average. The study revealed 
95 percent of the apps studied in 
the age five and under category 
contained at least one type of 
advertising, and 100 percent of 
free apps contained advertising 
as opposed to the 88 percent of 
purchased apps.

don’t really know what you’re 
going to be taking,” Salvador 
said. 
“It 
really 
helped 
me 

improve my experience in terms 
of scheduling and planning 
my semester because I could 
add — for some classes — like 
4 different discussion sections, 
which you can attend to any 
of those in CS courses. I could 
really understand all of the 
possibilities of how my schedule 

would look but using only this 
tool.”

Though some students have 

started using Coursicle, others 
use 
Schedule 
Builder, 
the 

University-provided 
platform 

for students to visually see 
schedule combinations and plan 
their semester.

Still, other students are not 

looking for scheduling help, but 
rather information on specific 
courses, which Coursicle does 
not provide. 

Many choose to use the 

University-backed 
Academic 

Reporting Tools, or ART 2.0. 
Like Coursicle, ART 2.0 allows 
students to check courses for 
the upcoming semester, but 
it does not have the option to 
create a class schedule or track 
open seats in a class. Instead, 

ART 2.0 focuses on providing 
separate tabs for “instructors,” 
“majors” and “courses.” It also 
lets students look at professor 
ratings, see what kinds of 
classes people in a certain major 
tend to take and look at grade 
distributions.

The Michigan Daily has also 

launched Grade Guide, which 
allows students to compare 
grade 
distributions 
among 

classes to help decide which 
classes might fit their desired 
level of academic rigor.

Salvador 
commented 
he 

was not familiar with ART 
2.0, and finds he needs a 
schedule platform more than an 
informational guide.

“I 
have 
not 
used 
that 

platform. I don’t know how old 
it is,” Salvador said. “If it’s old 

then the University has done a 
really terrible job promoting it. 
I try to keep updated with stuff 
regarding technology around 
campus ... If I really missed it 
and it was good, then I guess it 
was my bad.”

But ART 2.0’s creators say 

the user base of their tool has 
grown a lot over the last year — 
they say nearly half the students 
on campus use it. Throughout 
the fall 2018 term, the site has 
averaged around 500 visits 
a day. The website also has a 
feedback feature, and over the 
past year and a half has received 
about 60 suggestions.

Prof. 
August 
Evrard, 

faculty lead of ART 2.0, said 
collaboration between students 
and designers is crucial when 
it comes to creating the most 

effective interface for ART 2.0.

“A lot of the design of ART 

and its functionality is built 
out by student interns,” Evrard 
said. “The office hires interns 
and they do fantastic work, 
we’re engaging right now with 
a School of Information class 
(SI 501) and a team called 
Team Blue Solution is working 
with us to explore how course 
descriptions 
are 
managed 

across the University.”

LSA junior Yara El-Tawil 

has consulted ART 2.0 before 
taking classes. She hoped the 
tool would give her a better 
perspective about her workload 
for the upcoming semester.

this August.

Pendse 
previously 
served 

in a similar capacity at Brown 
University. When arriving at 
the University this summer, 
Pendse said he wondered why 
the University wasn’t one of 
the top leaders in technology 
use in the classroom and across 
campus. 
From 
employing 

technological 
advancements 

like 
voice 
recognition 
of 

professors in the classroom, or 
transparency for students in 
regards to how their personal 
data is used by the University, 
Pendse asked the assembly to 
consider the implementation of 
such breakthroughs.

“The question is now … would 

it be possible when I walk into 
the classroom for it to recognize 
me and have the technology 
in the classroom adapt to my 
needs?” Pendse said.

Pendse 
explained 
his 

philosophy 
behind 
effective 

communication between him 
and his staff. In his job, he 
provides staff with weekly 
memos and offers his cell phone 
number if they ever want to

earing the news of the 
shooting at the Tree of Life 
synagogue in Pittsburgh, I 
was numb. Another shooting at a place 
that is supposed to be safe and sacred. 
It was horrifically disgusting and 
incredibly sad, but it didn’t feel very 
different from the other shootings 
at schools, churches, bars and movie 
theaters. I must be desensitized to 
mass shootings, but am I supposed to 
feel different because it happened to 
my people?
On social media, my friends were 
all changing their profile pictures 
and posting articles and statuses 
about their thoughts, experiences 
and feelings about the shooting. It 
wasn’t just my fellow Jewish friends 
— allies were posting in solidarity. In 
class, students and professors were 
discussing the event and making it 
clear to students that if they needed 
extensions or a space to talk, they 
were available. There were vigils 
on campus and people gathered to 
mourn.
It was quite beautiful to see 
everyone come together. People 
were actively making space for those 
mourning to heal in all the ways they 
needed. But I did not entirely feel like 
I was mourning or needed to find 
support within my community. I 
didn’t want to talk about the shooting 
at all and I was uncomfortable with 
the amount of coverage it was getting 
compared to past shootings and 
recent discrimination toward other 
marginalized groups that have been 
happening in our country.
After I reflected on the news, I 
called my sister to hear how she was 
feeling. She reacted similarly to me 
about the devastating event. We 
reflected on the fact that it could have 
happened in our temple, to our family 
and community members and if we 
were closer to the massacre would be 
reacting differently. However, by the 
end of the phone call, we were back 
to discussing our normal dilemmas of 
stress and work.
In my day-to-day life, I don’t 
experience anti-Semitism. I don’t look 
stereotypically Jewish. I currently 
don’t wear a Jewish star or a kippah. 
Visibly, I can hide my Jewish identity 
until you hear my very Jewish-

German last name. I grew up in West 
Bloomfield, which has a dense Jewish 
community. Most of my out-of-school 
activities were Jewish-affiliated, from 
my reform temple’s youth group to 
volunteering with fellow Jews in 
Detroit. Being Jewish was always 
celebrated, and I felt a large amount of 
comfort and joy in my Jewish identity.
At the beginning of my college 
career, I stopped feeling this pride 
in my Jewish identity. I felt a need 
to explore outside of my community 
by joining groups and organizations 
where being Jewish wasn’t the only 
identity that brought us together. I 
decided to stop wearing my Jewish 
star necklace or opal hamsa so it 
wasn’t obvious where I came from. I 
wanted to be able to socialize, learn 
and grow with people who were 
different from me.
As I’m approaching the end of 
my college career, I’m fairly happy 
with all of my gained experiences, 
relationships and places I found with 
people who had shared interests and 
identities other than being Jewish. 
But I definitely think this need to 
leave or hide my Jewish identity was 
a form of internalized anti-Semitism. 
This term refers to the unconscious 
beliefs and behaviors passed down 
by family members and results from 
historical trauma and present-day 
oppression. Now, looking back and 
reflecting on my previous mindset, 
I find it extremely upsetting that I 
thought that being Jewish would 
impact or limit my ability to connect 
and learn with new people. But I still 
feel this need to gloss over my Jewish 
identity in progressive or social 
justice circles and thus adding to my 
uncomfortableness with the current 
anti-Semitic events.
My experience as a Jewish person 
has been comfortable and privileged. 
With my light European skin, I can 
be like any other privileged white 
person. Though not all Jews are white, 
American Jews who were Eastern 
European immigrants with light skin 
were only considered white when 
they assimilated into the mainstream 
American culture after World War 
II. 
Changing 
their 
appearance, 
becoming more secular, speaking 
English instead of Yiddish and 

educating their children in American 
schools allowed them to gain a better 
lifestyle. But consequently, they lost 
parts of their heritage and practice.
Also, Jews are often seen as a model 
minority for being a marginalized 
group that is particularly successful 
in America but still very marginalized 
throughout the world. I often 
consider whether our model minority 
status allows recent events like the 
Pittsburgh shooting or the professor’s 
rejection of letters of recommendation 
to become an even more important 
issue in the news even though 
there have been many other acts of 
discrimination or greater shootings 
for other marginalized communities.
I find myself comparing the 
experience of my marginalized Jewish 
community to other marginalized 
communities. 
I 
sometimes 
find 
myself thinking that American Jews 
don’t experience as much oppression 
because we may have more privilege 
than other marginalized groups in 
America. But after revisiting a piece 
that I have read in so many courses 
in Audre Lorde’s “There Is No 
Hierarchy of Oppressions,” I realized 
that making this claim takes away 
from the fact that the experience of 
anti-Semitism for Jews in America 
is valid. Comparing oppressions only 
makes it harder for people to come 
together and support one another to 
fight injustice.
During recent news of more anti-
Semitic acts happening in our country, 
like the graffiti in a New York City 
synagogue, I’ve been feeling nervous 
to publish this piece knowing that my 
people have been experiencing more 
stress, anxiety and fear than usual. 
But one of the core values of Judaism 
is to question things and have honest 
debates. And when we silence voices, 
especially Jewish voices, we don’t 
leave room for conversation and 
dialogue that help us gain a better 
understanding of our experience as 
Jewish people. I’m only one Jew with 
one story, and I hope by sharing my 
experience others can reflect on their 
own.

T 

he 2018 midterm elections 
have concluded, and while 
the outcomes of several 
close races have yet to be officially 
determined, the broader results are 
clear. Democrats have retaken the 
House, while Republicans built on 
their previously-narrow majority in 
the Senate. As the results came in, both 
sides publicly claimed victory, with 
President Donald Trump calling the 
night a “tremendous success” while 
Democratic leaders celebrated taking 
control of the House. Political analysts 
will 
comb 
thoroughly 
through 
Tuesday’s results in the coming weeks, 
but here are some early takeaways.
This was a Democratic wave, but 
not a nationwide wave.
Democrats had not won the 
House in a decade, and not once since 
the maps were redrawn in 2010, so 
regaining a majority in the lower 
chamber represents a significant 
accomplishment. 
Due 
partly 
to 
gerrymandering, Democrats have 
faced an uphill battle to retake the 
House in recent cycles — in 2012, the 
GOP maintained a 33-seat majority 
despite losing the House popular vote 
nationwide.
Nonetheless, 
Democratic 
challengers 
unseated 
dozens 
of 
longtime 
GOP 
representatives, 
including many in right-leaning but 
anti-Trump districts that Clinton won 
in 2016. Pundits devoted considerable 
attention over the past two years to 
the stunning gains by Democrats 
in various special elections relative 
to their performance in 2016, and 
these gains were replicated in the 
actual midterms. U.S. Rep. Karen 
Handel, R-Ga., known for defeating 
Jon Ossoff in a high-profile 2017 
special election, lost her seat to a new 
Democratic challenger. The flipping of 
the House confirms that signs of voter 
dissatisfaction, including Trump’s 
low approval ratings and Democratic 
success in special elections, were 
indicative of broader Democratic 
momentum.
Still, the cycle wasn’t all good 
for Democrats. The average House 
district swung ten points in favor 
of Democrats, which is slightly 
smaller than the 2006 Democratic 
wave and only half the size of the 
2010 Republican wave, enabling 
Republicans to retain a sizable number 
of House seats deemed toss-ups prior 
to the election. Furthermore, on the 
Senate side, Democrats lost ground, 
surrendering seats in Indiana, North 
Dakota and Missouri, and whiffing 

on chances to pick up seats in Texas 
and Tennessee. The sole Democratic 
pick-up of the night came in Nevada, 
but Arizona went blue yesterday 
with Kyrsten Sinema declared the 
winner. The race in Florida has yet 
to be called and will determine the 
extent of the GOP’s gains. Democrats 
needed a truly massive wave to flip 
the Senate, and while it isn’t surprising 
that such a wave failed to materialize, 
it is nonetheless discouraging that the 
GOP was able to extend their majority.
While Trump is unpopular overall, 
he remains very popular with his 
base and enjoys net-positive approval 
ratings in most red-leaning states. 
Flipping the House proves this was a 
wave year for Democrats, but as the 
Senate results show, that blue wave did 
not hit everywhere.
Democrats are facing extreme 
institutional challenges.
It is no secret that Democrats face 
institutional obstacles in their quest 
to regain power. Tuesday’s results 
underscore this reality. Democrats 
were facing an extremely tough Senate 
map in which they were defending 24 
seats, many in red and purple states 
won by Trump in 2016. Furthermore, 
only nine Republican seats were up 
for election, limiting opportunities 
for pick-ups. Even in a good year for 
Democrats, GOP gains were probable.
Looking 
forward, 
these 
institutional challenges are not going 
away. The GOP’s strong performance 
casts doubt on whether Democrats 
have a realistic shot of retaking the 
Senate in 2020, another year with 
limited opportunities for pick-ups. 
In the long term, Democrats are at a 
disadvantage in the Senate. It’s simple 
math: Every state is represented 
equally in the Senate and there are 
more red states than blue states. The 
Democratic majority in the Senate 
from 2006 to 2014 was enabled by 
Democrats’ ability to win seats in red 
states. That didn’t happen this year but 
will need to happen in the future if the 
Democrats are to retake the Senate.
Democrats’ 
institutional 
disadvantages aren’t limited to the 
Senate. At the presidential level, 
Democrats have won the popular vote 
in six of the past seven presidential 
elections, but have only actually won 
four of those elections. Furthermore, 
the 
GOP 
dominates 
the 
state 
legislatures, leading to advantages 
during redistricting season.
Trump and the GOP are losing 
the middle.
Democrats despise Trump while 

Republicans have coalesced around 
him. More significantly, independents 
are beginning to abandon him. A 
largely overlooked aspect of the 2016 
presidential election is that Trump 
beat Clinton among independents 
46 percent to 42 percent. Since then, 
independents have turned on Trump, 
with polls finding Trump’s approval 
ratings among independents to be 
as low as 31 percent. Exit poll data 
from Tuesday shows independents 
supported 
Democratic 
House 
candidates by a margin of 14 points 
— an exact reversal of the margin 
independents supported Republicans 
in the 2014 midterms.
Trump has two years to regain 
favor with independents, and he will 
need to if he wants any legitimate shot 
at re-election.
Demographic change is not 
saving the Democratic Party... yet.
Democrats hope that shifting 
demographics, namely a growing 
share of the electorate that is 
Hispanic 
and 
African-American, 
will allow the party to win races in 
traditionally conservative states like 
Georgia, Texas and Arizona. After 
Trump won these states by relatively 
modest margins, many expected 
Democrats to flip them in 2018. 
Though the margins were once again 
historically close, Democrats lost the 
Texas Senate race and appear likely 
to lose the currently uncalled Georgia 
gubernatorial race.
Alarmingly, 
in 
some 
states, 
Republicans 
performed 
relatively 
well 
among 
certain 
minority 
demographics. 
In 
Florida, 
the 
Democratic candidates for Senate and 
governor won the Hispanic vote by 
just a 10-percent margin compared 
to the 28-percent margin Clinton 
enjoyed in 2016.
These results show that Democrats 
are further away from winning these 
states than many hoped. While 
many red states are becoming more 
competitive due to demographic 
change, Democrats appear to still 
be several cycles away from actually 
winning statewide races in Georgia, 
Texas and elsewhere, suggesting 
that Democrats’ best strategy for 
2020 is rebuilding the “blue wall” 
that Trump shattered in 2016, rather 
than relying on demographic change 
to win these emerging battlegrounds 
in the South.

A

nd here we are. All of 
the 
excitement 
going 
into the 2018 midterm 
elections reached its climax last 
Tuesday, with the 49-percent 
voter participation rate the highest 
in 50 years contributing to what 
was nationally touted as the first 
major referendum on the 2016 
election 
of 
President 
Donald 
Trump. I was proud of the wide 
effort to get people out to vote at 
the University of Michigan, which 
I saw personally, having to wait in 
line over half an hour at Pierpont 
Commons before I could finally 
receive a ballot.
But 
was 
this 
“historic” 
election really as upending as 
people claimed it would be? Did 
the Democrats really surf an 
overpowering blue wave and take 
over Capitol Hill by storm? Or did 
the Republicans pull off Trump’s 
prophesized “RED WAVE!”? The 
media really seems to agree with 
the former, with CNN’s Heather 
Cox Richardson claiming that “a 
blue wave happened Tuesday, and it 
was a big one.” Real Clear Politics’s 
Sean Trende said of the midterms 
that “overall, Republicans had a 
tough night.”
Honestly, I didn’t see it. Of 
course, the Democrats took back 
the House, with an expected gain 
of 35 seats, thereby finally ending 
eight years of Republican control. 
But when you compare it to the 
Republican gains of 2014, when 
they won “nearly every contested 
Senate race” as well as in 2010, 
when they flipped over 60 House 
seats and six Senate seats, the 
result on Tuesday seemed to be 
more representative of Smurf tears 
battering a red wall than of a blue 
surge flooding Washington, D.C.
Obviously, 
the 
Democrats 
were hindered by Republican 
gerrymandering, 
which 
suppressed some of the potential 
gains. To illustrate, in 2014, the 
Republicans won 52 percent of 
the popular vote and claimed 57 
percent of House seats, while this 
year, the Democrats are expected 
to win about 52 percent of House 
seats despite also winning 51.4 
percent of the popular vote. Also, 
the Democrats were favored to 
win the House. There was nothing 
unpredictable about that. What 
was, however, were the shocking 
gains by the Republicans in the 
Senate. In past “wave” elections of 
1994, 2010 and 2014, the GOP did not 
lose any of their incumbent Senate 
seats. Neither did the Democrats 
in 2006 or 2008. The fact that 
the Republicans were capable of 
padding their Senate majority is 
indicative of a general political 
culture that has not fully rejected 
Donald Trump and his Republican 
Party. Worth mentioning, though, 
is that all competitive incumbent 

seats that the Democrats lost (save 
for North Dakota) this election 
were under Republican control in 
2006 and 2008.
Again, I don’t want to take 
anything away from the Democrats. 
They ran some very tight races and 
upended Republican candidates in 
areas that have been traditionally 
red. Case in point was the defeat 
of incumbent U.S. Rep. Barbara 
Comstock, R-Va., by Democratic 
challenger Jennifer Wexton in 
Virginia’s 10th district, a district 
that hasn’t gone blue since 1980. 
Not only that, but they were able 
to make substantial gains in 
suburban districts, some of which 
voted — albeit quite surprisingly 
— overwhelmingly Democratic. 
But, now, as we look toward 2020, 
the Democrats desperately need to 
change their strategy if they want 
to beat Trump.
The midterm elections were 
fueled by a few major trends that 
will have a direct effect on the 
makeup of Congress for the next 
two years. Most notably was the 
so-called 
“Kavanaugh 
effect.” 
Those who expressed opposition 
towards Brett Kavanaugh and 
were in competitive races were 
ousted from office. For example, 
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Sen. 
Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Sen. Bill 
Nelson, D-Fla., were replaced by 
Republican candidates in red states, 
although Bill Nelson is heading 
for a recount. Perhaps most telling 
was the re-election of Sen. Joe 
Manchin, D-W.V., who voted in 
favor of Kavanaugh. Considering 
that West Virginia went to Trump 
in 2016 by more than 40 points, this 
is particularly impressive.
This was one contributing factor 
that showed a real trend toward 
the political success of moderate 
Democrats on Tuesday. These 
center-leaning candidates flipped 
the majority of the 28 competitive 
House races that the party needed 
to win in order to secure a majority. 
Progressive 
candidates, 
while 
enjoying 
perhaps 
“upset-level” 
success in the primaries, only won 
in the districts that were already 
leaning quite a ways to the left. 
For example, Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, a self-described Democratic 
Socialist, won in New York’s 14th 
district, which hadn’t gone red 
since 1993, by over 60 points. 
Progressive 
candidate 
Andrew 
Gillum, however, ended up losing 
in the statewide Florida election to 
Republican Ron DeSantis, though 
the race is currently headed to a 
state-mandated recount.
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
Republicans 
experienced 
an 
opposite effect. In the primaries, 
many of Trump’s critics led 
unsuccessful campaigns, leading 
to an incoming Republican caucus 
that is more aligned with Trump 

and his policies than ever before. 
In the Republican primaries, in 
most races, the candidates with 
Trump’s endorsement ended up 
victorious. This was especially 
the case in Kansas as Kris Kobach 
beat incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer, 
a candidate who was originally 
favored to retain his seat. Though 
Kobach was not successful in the 
general election, others such as 
Mike Braun and Ron DeSantis 
have emerged victorious after 
aligning 
themselves 
with 
the 
president. Though there weren’t 
many moderates who survived the 
primary elections in competitive 
areas, the few cases, such as that 
of incumbent U.S. Rep. Carlos 
Curbelo in Florida’s 26th district, 
ended up on the wrong end of 
the ballots in the aftermath of 
Tuesday’s elections.
Trump 
undeniably 
had 
a 
major effect on the results in his 
own party, winning Senate or 
gubernatorial races in six out of 
the eight states he campaigned 
in during the week leading up to 
the elections. If anything, Trump 
seems to be looking forward to 
a split Congress with potential 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi presiding 
over the newly Democratic House. 
With the Democrats preparing 
for “an onslaught of hearings, 
subpoenas and investigations into 
nearly every corner of the Trump 
administration,” Trump himself 
seems quite unfazed, claiming 
“he could have ended (the Mueller 
investigations) anytime he wanted” 
at Wednesday’s post-election press 
conference. Unless the Democratic 
Party pursues unifying initiatives, 
it is very likely that continuous 
investigation 
and 
probes 
(not 
to 
mention, 
resultant 
media 
attention) will energize Trump’s 
base 
and 
maybe 
even 
bring 
more independents over to the 
Republican side. One could look to 
history for an example, such as the 
disappointing Republican midterm 
election results in 1998 when said 
party was placing then-President 
Bill Clinton under continuous 
threat of impeachment.
As of now, I think Trump has 
managed to put himself in the 
driver’s seat. He has positioned 
himself well with a Senate most 
likely to stay within Republican 
hands through 2024 and a House 
that intends to play party politics. 
And until the Democrats look 
towards 
bipartisanship 
and 
capitalize 
on 
their 
suburban 
moderate gains, I think Donald 
Trump might have actually been 
the real winner of the 2018 midterm 
elections.

Drug Use and Health reported 
that over 21 million Americans 
aged 12 and older have struggled 
with illegal substance abuse. 
The CDC reported in 2017 that 

nearly 115 deaths occur every day 
in the U.S. as a result of opioid 
overdoses. At these rates, the 
drug use in America has reached 
epidemic 
levels. 
One 
might 
assume 
that 
drug 
addiction 
plagues 
only 
the 
periphery 
of society — the isolated and 
the forlorn. Yet, addiction is a 
disease and it can affect anyone. 
Therefore, now more than ever, 
the story of David and Nic Sheff 
is a crucial tale to tell.
“Beautiful Boy” tells the story 
of Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet, 
“Call Me by Your Name”), a teen 
addicted to crystal meth, and 
his father David (Steve Carell, 
“Battle of the Sexes”), who is 
desperate to help his son on 
the road to recovery. The film, 
based off of David and Nic’s 
respective memoirs “Beautiful 
Boy: 
A 
Father’s 
Journey 
Through His Son’s Addiction” 
and “Tweak: Growing Up on 
Methamphetamines” 
was 
directed and written by Felix 
van 
Groeningen 
(“Belgica”) 
alongside Luke Davies (“Lion”).
“Beautiful Boy” acts as a 

conversation between father and 
son, offering both perspectives of 
the memoirs on which it is based. 
While the film attempts to create 
a conversation between father 
and son, sponsor and addict, it 
sometimes falls short, making it 
feel more like a monologue than a 
dialogue. But as the title suggests, 
the film focuses primarily on 
David’s struggle in trying to help 
his son, rather than Nic’s journey. 
The film employs a series of 
stunning emotional flashbacks, 
offering a stark contrast between 
Nic’s innocent childhood and the 
dark path towards addiction. The 
flashbacks offer context, allowing 
the audience to relish the sweet 
and forgotten memories of Nic’s 
idyllic childhood. Therein lies the 
essence of the film, an honest and 
emotionally provocative portrait 
of addiction. The storyline of 
“Beautiful Boy” is a relatable 
one, which makes the film all 
the 
more 
poignant. 
Anyone 
who knows someone who has 
struggled with addiction knows 
this story and the weight and 
pain that it carries.
The 
cyclical 
narrative 
of 
“Beautiful Boy” acts like a 
spiral of bad decisions, creating 
a whirlpool of sobriety and 
relapse. Nic recovers only to get 
back on the wagon, and David 
becomes hopeful only to be 
crushed by another overdose or 
disappearance. The repetition 
is reminiscent of a drug addict’s 
journey 
towards 
recovery, 
a 
recurring 
and 
constant 
struggle 
between 
vice 
and 
vigor. A nuanced and emotional 
performance from the always 
brilliant Chalamet elevates the 
story to new heights. At some 
moments, Chalamet’s Nic is a 

shell of himself and at others 
he is a cheeky teen who doodles 
in his notebook and listens to 
Nirvana. The ups and downs of 
Nic’s recovery are emphasized 
by 
Chalamet’s 
performance, 
making us feel every seductive 
rush of dopamine and every 
crash towards the depths of 
the 
excruciating 
despair 
of 
withdrawal. In other words, 
Chalamet is nothing short of 
beautiful in another knockout, 
Oscar-worthy performance from 
the boy wonder.
Likewise, Carell’s David is a 
father desperate to save his son 
from himself. His performance is 
filled with the pain and mourning 
of the father of an addict, feeling 
powerless in assisting his son in 
the fight he must endure. The 
performances by Chalamet and 
Carell are the bread and butter of 
“Beautiful Boy,” serving tension, 
conflict and payoff in their 
emotionally stunning portrayal 
of father and son. Still, the film 
leaves something to be desired 
in terms of explanation, often 
opting for vagueness and leaving 
too much unsaid.
The conclusion of the Sheffs’ 
story is somewhat unsatisfying, 
in the sense that it ends where it 
begins, facing the reality of drug 
addiction. After all, the journey 
towards recovery is one that 
extends past years of sobriety: 
It is an everyday struggle for 
recovering 
addicts. 
Overall, 
“Beautiful Boy” is an emotional 
rollercoaster, 
making 
every 
feeling be felt with the utmost 
intensity. The real star of the 
film, however, is Chalamet as 
the titular boy beauty, making 
“Beautiful Boy” nothing short of 
simply beautiful.

‘Beautiful Boy’ is simply 
a beautifully tragic story

FILM REVIEW

“Overlord” doesn’t ask to 
be taken too seriously. Even 
before audiences have set foot 
in the theater, the first trailer 
set scenes of World War II-era 
zombie carnage to the dulcet 
tones 
of 
AC/DC’s 
“Hell’s 
Bells,” and once you’re in your 
seats and the opening titles 
roll, they do so in black and 
white — immediately recalling 
any number of sci-fi/horror 
B-movies from the ’50s and ’60s. 
The title, taking up the whole 
screen, wipes into view over 

shots of battleships at sea, and 
if you’ve ever watched the kind 
of Cold War “rah-rah, America” 
genre flick this is deliberately 
aping, it’ll likely bring a smile to 
your face right off the bat.
That’s the kind of movie 
“Overlord” is, and from those 
opening scenes, it owns it 
completely. It’s the kind of 
movie where characters speak 
mostly in war movie clichés, but 
you don’t care because they’re 
Americans 
fighting 
Nazis, 
so you like them basically by 
default. It’s the kind of movie 
with a villain so cartoonishly 
evil 
and 
over-the-top 
that 
you can’t help but giggle as 
actor Pilou Asbæk (“Game of 
Thrones”) does his best to make 
Hugo Weaving’s Red Skull 
look subtle and understated. 
Approached 
on 
its 
blood-
soaked, insane level, “Overlord” 
can be a lot of fun.
Contrary to popular belief, 
“Overlord” is not the latest 
film in producer J.J. Abrams’s 

stealth “Cloverfield” franchise 
— though depending on who you 
believe, it was intended to be 
until “The Cloverfield Paradox” 
was announced, released and 
pretty much universally burnt 
in effigy over the course of a 
single tumultuous Super Bowl 
Sunday — so if you spend the 
whole movie waiting for a 
pre-fame T.J. Miller (“Silicon 
Valley”) to show up with a video 
camera, you’ll probably walk 
away 
disappointed. 
Instead, 
it takes place the day before 
the invasion of Normandy, as 
a squad of American soldiers 
is inserted behind German 
lines to pave the way for Allied 
forces. After making their way 
to an occupied French village, 
they discover that the Germans 
have begun experimenting on 
the population with the goal of 
making themselves invincible. 
It doesn’t go as planned.
From there, it’s a quick 
descent into delightful chaos 
as the Americans have to fight 
through waves of Nazis, mutated 
Nazis, undead Nazis and other 
assorted 
Nazi 
abominations 
to ensure D-Day’s success. It’s 
deeply silly, gleefully over-
violent and a complete blast 
from start to finish. Not exactly 
the “Nazi Zombies” rip-off the 
trailers promised, “Overlord” 
plays more like “Saving Private 
Ryan” meets John Carpenter’s 
“The Thing.” Most of the scares 
— and certainly the best ones — 
are accomplished through some 
seriously incredible make up 
and practical creature effects, 
while director Julius Avery 
(“Son of a Gun”) creates set 
pieces that don’t lack for scale 
despite a comparatively modest 
budget.
In 
this, 
“Overlord” 
is 
something of an anomaly, as 
it threads the needle between 
low budget indie fare and 
big budget effects fests. It’s 
big enough for mainstream 
audiences to get amped up on 
the blood-soaked action and 
the banter between characters, 

yet those looking for a B-movie 
homage or a niche thriller will 
be sated, too. Avery is given 
the freedom to craft a jaw-
dropping opening action scene, 
yet later scenes are far quieter 
and smaller scale; they rely on 
smart filmmaking — genuinely 
scary sound design and fluid 
cinematography — to keep you 

simultaneously 
anticipating 
and dreading what might be 
around the next corner. Either 
way it’s grounded in a sort of 
simple pleasure, whether it’s 
the pleasure of watching an 
American guy punch a Nazi or 
of watching a really good scare 
come together to burn an image 
into your brain, and sometimes 
that’s all you need.

‘Overlord’ an uber-gory 
good time with creativity

COMMUNITY CULTURE 

This past Monday evening 
I had the chance to sit down 
in 
a 
packed-beyond-capacity 
Art and Architecture Building 
Auditorium to hear a talk from 
Craig Dykers, co-founder of the 
world-renowned 
architectural 
firm Snohetta. Often when people 
meet Dykers, they are oblivious 
to the fact that Snohetta is indeed 
his company. “Where is this Mr. 
Snohetta?” they’ll ask. 
This isn’t surprising, though. 
None of the names of Dykers or 
his co-founders appear readily 
on the Snohetta website. This 
is because since its conception 
in 1989, Snohetta has been an 
ever-growing 
interdisciplinary 
team of staff from all areas 
of the industry. They have a 
highly collaborative, hands-on 
process that enables them to best 
understand how the forms they 
create will become habitats for 
humanity.
“We’re 
taught 
that 
architecture is about the form 
itself,” Dykers said. Architects are 
superior at this, but they often fail 
to consider human relationships 
to their forms. Humans don’t sit 
calmly and comfortably within 

the confines of a concrete box 
that has been abstracted to the 
point of oppression. 
“We’re irrational and unusual,” 
Dykers said. To this end, he pulled 
his shirt up and said, “Woah, 
what kind of creatures are we?” 
to a big laugh from the crowd.
Snohetta’s 
first 
project 
came in 1989 after winning an 
international design competition 
for 
the 
new 
Great 
Library 
of Alexandria in Egypt. The 
building’s 
sliced 
cylindrical 
concrete form demands one’s 
eye to study it. The library is 
of enormous value to its users 
and to the city as a whole, as 
it has brought about the same 
type of cultural and economic 
development 
its 
ancient 
predecessor did several thousand 
years ago. 
When discussing the building’s 
impacts, Dykers stressed that, 
while economics is thought to 
drive culture in most cases, the 
construction of an important civic 
center like this can be invaluable 
to the community it serves. It 
educates the disenfranchised, 
hosts cultural events, brings in 
tourism and is a joy for its users.
Snohetta 
continued 
to 
influence 
the 
public 
sphere 
from here. In 2007, it completed 
its 
critically-acclaimed 
Oslo 

Opera House in Norway. The 
building is one of a kind in that 
its roof is constructed of concrete 
platforms that gradually slope 
down from the building’s roof to 
the water of the bay adjacent to 
the site. This directly engineers 
a connection between what is 
usually a building’s most private 
space, the roof, down past the 
public space to another previously 
inaccessible space, the water.
In America, local laws certainly 
would have mandated a handrail 
along the roof’s edge that would 
have completely detracted from 
the point of the project. It’s the 
completely free and unrestricted 
exploration the building allows 
— primarily outside — that lends 
itself to public takeover. Dykers 
explained that on opening night, 
a couple were found having sex 
on the roof. Shortly after this, 
Dykers received a video of a 
daredevil Parisian motorcyclist 
using the building as a stunt 
course.
Although Dykers conceded 
that these acts were certainly 
illegal, he was visibly excited to 
have designed the habitat that 
contextualized them. According 
to him, architects “design our 
own zoo.” It’s an architect’s duty 
to consolidate the many complex 
programs (uses) most buildings 

Dykers creates habitats 
to build social interaction

BEN VASSAR
Daily Arts Writer

require such that “people can 
intuitively use them.”
This is why Dykers loves 
making public spaces. In the case 
of his Hunt Library project for 
North Carolina State University, 
a five-story building, Dykers 
placed brightly colored stairs by 
the front entrance that visibly 
run the length of the building at a 
gradual slope to incentivize users 
to take the stairs. Not only is this 
the healthier option, it also allows 
people to gain an understanding 

of the library’s resources and 
spaces far better than if they had 
taken the elevator. 
When asked why he still 
continues to make libraries in 
this day and age, Dykers said it’s 
because libraries have always 
been about people. They existed 
for two thousand years prior to 
the mass dissemination of books, 
and he has no doubt that they will 
continue to exist long after the 
use of print. His new library for 
Ryerson University in Toronto, 

for example, was agreed to be 
a nice place to socialize by 93 
percent of students.
Constructing spaces like this 
is what keeps Dykers excited 
about his job. Snohetta now has 
eight offices around the world 
that practice independently of 
each other. While each operates 
within its own local cultural 
context, 
Snohetta’s 
portfolio 
is unified by the common goal 
of creating habitats that foster 
social interaction.

TV REVIEW

In 
the 
horrifyingly 
antiquated, 
backwards-
looking town of Belt Buckle 
Bay, three superhero drag 
queens 
— 
Scarlet, 
Lemon 
and Safira — take a respite 
from their day jobs in a bland 
department store to protect 
the city’s LGBTQ community 
by night. The result is a very 
entertaining 
satire 
of 
the 
conservative establishment’s 
continuing bigotry towards 

LGBTQ groups.
“Super 
Drags” 
was 
originally created in Brazil, 
as evidenced by the fact that 
most of the text displayed 
remains 
in 
Portuguese. 
Netflix recently produced an 
English dub, with the main 
trio of drag queens voiced by 
Ginger Minj, Shangela and 
Trixie Mattel of “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race” fame. Their main 
nemesis is an evil drag queen 
intent on stealing the life force 
of the LGBTQ residents of Belt 
Buckle Bay.
“Super 
Drags” 
is 
nothing short of constantly 
entertaining. The animation 
is expressive and colorful, 

and the English dub is full 
of life, which is rare among 
dubs. 
The 
protagonists 
in 
the trio are each distinct and 
quite charming. The dialogue 
is fast-paced and full of wit, 
although 
it 
is 
evident 
at 
points that some jokes may 
have been lost in translation. 
The show is intended to be a 
full celebration of drag and 
LGBTQ culture in general.
The humor ranges from 
extremely 
low-brow 
dick 
jokes to clever satire on “Fox 
and Friends”-style programs 
and personalities who harp on 
and on about the proliferation 
of 
“political 
correctness.” 
Ironically, 
the 
show 
was 
protested 
by 
conservative 
action groups in both Brazil 
and the U.S., with groups in 
the latter boycotting Netflix. 
The show uses its fast-
paced style as a framework 
for exploring broader social 
issues, such as the continuing 
harassment 
and 
prejudice 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ 
community face around the 
world. It also tackles issues 
of body image and racism 
both within and outside of 
the LGBTQ community. It is 
worth noting, however, that 
“Super 
Drags” 
approaches 
these 
issues 
through 
a 
Brazilian lens. While minority 
communities in both countries 
face many of the same issues, 
the cultural and historical 
differences of the countries 
make 
the 
more 
nuanced 

aspects of the discussion seem 
rather unfamiliar to American 
audiences.
I must disclaim, however, 
that as someone who is not a 
part of the LGBTQ community, 
I am not entirely qualified to 

judge whether “Drag Queens” 
is an entirely accurate, positive 
form of queer representation 
on 
TV. 
While 
ostensibly 
very inclusive in terms of its 
rhetoric, some have raised 
the 
point 
that 
the 
show 
reinforces stereotypes of the 
drag community (for example, 
the show’s campiness) and 
is not necessarily a positive 
representation. Others on the 
internet have pointed out the 
differences in drag culture in 
Brazil and America and how 
the show is a more accurate 
portrayal of the former. While 
“Super Drags” is entertaining, 
it is worth keeping these 
issues in mind.

MUSIC

From his stint in “Jurassic 
Park” 
as 
a 
sharp-tongued 
mathematician to his more 
recent 
role 
in 
Marvel’s 
“Thor: 
Ragnarok” 
as 
The 
Grandmaster, Jeff Goldblum 
has grown to be a true pop-
culture icon. The addition of 
“jazz musician” to Goldblum’s 
vibrant and diverse roster is 

more than fitting. His new 
album 
with 
the 
Mildred 
Snitzer Orchestra, The Capital 
Studios Sessions, is like a long 
lost perfect puzzle piece — the 
world didn’t know it needed 
Jeff Goldblum singing and 
performing jazz with Sarah 
Silverman and Haley Reinhart 
until he gave it to them. While 
Goldblum 
doesn’t 
reinvent 
jazz 
the 
way 
one 
might 
expect (many consider jazz 
to be a “dying” genre in need 
of reinvention or a merciful 
death), he capitalizes on the 
advantages of jazz as a genre 
of live performance. The result 
is a strange yet delightful 
mixture 
of 
satisfying jazz 
riffs, velvet-smooth vocals and 
playful humor.
The album is comprised of 
14 songs, a mix of familiar hits 
and new material. Sometimes 
it can be a gamble to reprise 
“the 
classics,” 
especially 
when it comes to jazz. A genre 
dependent 
on 
originality, 
innovation 
and 
passion, 
a 
modern cover can come off 
as flat, boring and repetitive. 
But while there is certainly 
a strong sense of familiarity 
throughout the album with 
most of the songs being covers 
of jazz and swing classics 
from the ’30s and ’40s, like 
“Cantaloupe 
Island,” 
“My 
Baby Just Cares For Me,” 
“I Wish I Knew” and more, 
somehow Goldblum and his 
orchestra 
avoid 
the 
usual 

pitfall of over-cooking the old 
hits. Part of this comes from 
the alluring, intimate vocals of 
Haley Reinhart — she shines 
in particular in “Gee Baby” 
and “My Baby Just Cares For 
Me.” On the other hand, the 
humorous flirtation and easy 
exchanges between Goldblum 
and 
Reinhart 
turn 
the 
performances into something 
fun and casual, brightening 
some of the characteristic 
heaviness of the dark, smoky 
jazz club vibes.
The music alone is good. 
“Cantaloupe Island” opens the 
album with some impressive 
saxophone 
solos, 
and 
Goldblum proves his metal 
as a musician on the piano. 
The ensemble keeps a solid 
beat going, and there is an 
undeniable sense of joy and 
satisfaction from a quality 
jazz performance. Goldblum 
even treats the audience to 
some of his own vocals in a 
duet with Sarah Silverman, 
“Me and My Shadow,” which 
is an odd combination of jazz, 
comedy and a bit of Broadway-
style flair. The original song 
was a duet between Frank 
Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., 
but Goldblum and Silverman 
adapt the lyrics to fit a modern 
context, including some playful 
jabs like “we’ll change that 
name Redskins, is that such 
a chore?” and lighthearted 
banter, with Silverman and 
Goldblum remarking that the 
trumpet solo is like “a knife 
cutting hot butter” — which 
led to a discussion about the 
safety of leaving butter out 
to melt mid-song. The duet 
ends on a high note with 
Goldblum throwing in a nod 
to “Jurassic Park,” playing the 
movie’s theme on the piano. 
Silverman prays she won’t get 
eaten — Goldblum “calms” her 
fears with a playful “dinosaur 
growl.” At times Silverman 
and Goldblum leave something 
to be desired in passable but 
ultimately lackluster singing. 
However, while the duo may 
not be destined for the top of 
the charts anytime soon, their 
humor and oddball dynamic 
swoop in to save the day.
What saves the album from 
fading into obscurity alongside 
other attempted revivals of 
jazz and swing is the fact that 
the album is comprised solely 
of live recordings. Rather than 
simply producing yet another 

cover of a Nina Simone hit, 
Goldblum 
adds 
a 
distinct, 
fresh “Goldblum touch” to 
the performance with his side 
quips, banter and touch of 
silliness. Goldblum reminds 
the audience and performers 
that 
jazz, 
and 
music 
in 
general, doesn’t have to be so 
serious. A song can be good 
without 
necessarily 
being 
revolutionary 
or 
dripping 
with 
overdone 
dramatics. 
Sometimes music can just be 

fun. And at its core, that’s what 
Goldblum’s album is — fun. 
The image the album conveys 
is that of a couple of friends 
messing around, having fun 
and just enjoying the music. 
It’s this easy going simplicity 
that makes Goldblum’s album 
a good one. No one says it 
better than Goldblum himself 
when he calls out to Silverman, 
“Let’s do the ending again, 
I love that ending!” Music 
for the love of it, that’s what 
Goldblum’s album is all about. 
Everything else aside, the 
album is worth a listen, if only 
for some fun, some jazz and to 
hear Jeff Goldblum imitate an 
oddly sexy T-Rex in a spin on 
the classics of the swing and 
jazz masters.

Peoples-Jones emerging as top target

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
didn’t score a touchdown or 
notch more than 65 yards in a 
single game last year.
Then a freshman, he wasn’t 
alone in his struggles; the 
Wolverines’ leading receiver 
last year, Grant Perry, totaled 
just 307 yards himself. The 
offense as a whole managed 
157 
passing 
yards 
per 
conference game en route to a 
disappointing 8-5 record.
For the Detroit native, it 
was far from the first year he 
imagined.
“I feel like, as a competitor, 
any time where you’re not 
doing as well as you want, or 
the team isn’t doing as well as 
you wanted to, there can be 
tough times,” Peoples-Jones 
said Monday. “Just because 
you want to be the best. I’d 
just leave it at that.”
A year later, Peoples-Jones 
is helping lead a resurgent 
Michigan 
offense 
— 
and 
having quite a bit more fun 
doing it.
“Just 
playing 
with 
my 
teammates has been so much 
fun this year,” he said. “It 
definitely makes it fun to go 
out there and play each and 
every game.”
Success and enjoyment often 
go hand-in-hand, of course.
Peoples-Jones 
leads 
the 
Wolverines’ receiving corps 
in receptions (30), yards (447) 
and touchdowns (seven) — and 
it’s not hard to envision even 
more on the horizon. 
The former five-star recruit 
came to Michigan with plenty 
of hype to his name. He flashed 
signs in 2017 — including 
a 
44-yard 
run 
against 
Cincinnati and a 79-yard punt 
return score against Air Force 
— but struggled to sustain 
consistency.
This 
year, 
Peoples-Jones 
has emerged as a premier 
threat on an improved offense, 

adding new layers to his game 
each week.
“I think he has a better 
understanding of coverages 
and defenses, and how to get 
open on every 
play,” 
said 
junior tight end 
Sean 
McKeon. 
“He’s 
just 
making 
a 
lot 
of plays for us 
right now. He’s 
attacking 
the 
football, getting 
separation 
off 
really any kind 
of coverage.”
Against 
Michigan State, Peoples-Jones 
notched the play of the day — 
a 79-yard touchdown to break 
the 7-7 stalemate in the third 
quarter. As he swaggered into 
the end zone, Peoples-Jones 
posed like the Paul Bunyan 

trophy, a token he and his 
teammates would later hoist 
on the field. 
But there have been more 
subtle examples, too. 
Facing 
a 
third 
down 
against Rutgers 
on 
Saturday, 
Peoples-Jones 
lined up in the 
slot. He offered 
a 
deceptive 
move 
at 
the 
line 
to 
gain 
separation, 
then 
darted 
to the inside, 
catching a pass 
for a first down and carrying 
several defenders an extra 10 
yards for good measure.
Together through 10 games, 
the receiving corps has 89 
catches, 1,244 yards and 15 
touchdowns. In the entirety of 

last season, the wide receivers 
totaled just 97 catches, 1,151 
yards and three touchdowns.
It’s 
a 
unit 
that 
has 
unsurprisingly, 
given 
their 
relative 
youth, 
taken 
a 
signficant leap forward this 
season. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh has taken notice.
“The biggest thing is the way 
(the receivers) catch the ball. 
All the pass receivers, still the 
amount of drops is really so 
low right now for the year. The 
way they’re catching the ball 
is really good,” Harbaugh said. 
“Also, the separation they’ve 
gotten in the passing game. 
The precision in how they 
run the routes has been really 
good. The third thing I would 
point out is their blocking.”
And on Peoples-Jones in 
those specific categories?
“Boom, boom, boom. Top of 
the list.”

Sophomore wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones leads the team with 30 receptions, 447 yards and seven touchdowns.

good.”

The discussion moves away 
from football
A

t the same Monday press 
conference a year ago, 
approaching the penul-
timate 
game of 
the regular 
season, Jim 
Harbaugh 
looked like 
he wanted 
to be any-
where 
besides the 
podium.
Despite 
an 8-2 
record, the Michigan football 
team’s offense was a mess and the 
injury report read like its own ros-
ter — Harbaugh faced 10 questions 
about injuries alone. With a three-
game win streak, he was asked if 
he believed in momentum. The 
common denominator of every 
rapid-fire question was football.
Flash forward to Monday, 
November 12, 2018. As the Wol-
verines await Indiana for their 
final home game of the season, 
their win streak stands at nine. 
Momentum has left, and status 
quo has taken its place.
This Monday, as everything is 
trending in the right direction for 
Michigan football, talking about 
Michigan football took a backseat.
“I kinda forgot your question,” 
Harbaugh told Nick Baumgardner 
of the Detroit Free Press, who was 
inquiring about the run game. “Do 
you have a dog? A big dog, right?”
Baumgardner does have a dog: 
Biff, a boxer.
“Biff. Sounds like a good, strong 
dog,” Harbaugh said with com-
plete sincerity.
He eventually offered one sen-
tence on why he loves a good run 
game. But his team’s efforts were 
not exactly top of mind for him in 
the moment.
“I would also like to congratu-
late (Miami Dolphins running 
back) Frank Gore,” Harbaugh 
continued. “The record he set 
this past Sunday, and Frank is my 
favorite player of all that I’ve ever 
coached. Fourteen years of each 

year rushing for over 500 yards, 
surpassing Walter Payton and 
Emmitt Smith, is incredible. Just 
incredible.”
As his team goes, so does the 
frequency of Harbaugh’s effusive 
praise and non-sequiturs. He said 
he loves player meetings with 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
because the “paint peels off the 
walls” from his enthusiasm and 
censorable messages.
He went on to commend his 
wide receivers for playing through 
harsh winds against Rutgers.
“I dropped two in the pre-
game,” he said disappointedly. “I 
pride myself on catching them all.”
And for injury updates on soph-
omore defensive tackle Aubrey 
Solomon, who sat against the 
Scarlet Knights because of illness, 
Harbaugh offered sage advice: 
“It’s cold and flu season, get your 
flu shots.”
Sure, call it Harbaugh being 
Harbaugh and you might be right. 
But it seems different, almost 
intentional this time.
Like shooting a free throw 
in basketball, focusing on the 
mechanics can disrupt the psyche 

of an excellent shooter. Talk too 
much about football now, and you 
trip over the details.
And it’s not just Harbaugh — 
his players are doing the exact the 
same thing.
Junior running back Tru Wil-
son, who finished with eight car-
ries for a career-high 58 yards on 
Saturday, faced the media. Wilson 
didn’t receive any questions about 
his previous game.
But he got plenty about his pet 
snake, Mako.
“He’s just getting done shed-
ding, so I haven’t been able to 
play with him for the last week 
or so,” Wilson said. “I guess he’s 
blind when he sheds, so I guess it’s 
kinda dangerous — not danger-
ous, he’s not gonna kill me. The 
ball pythons are a very defensive 
creature.”
Wilson stepped away, and 
then it was senior receiver Grant 
Perry’s turn. He, like Wilson, 
donned a hat emblazoned with the 
now well-known “Revenge Tour” 
slogan. Perry said Santa is making 
all of the clothing extensions.
Shortly after, junior tight end 
Sean McKeon walks in. The Mas-

sachusetts native is asked about 
the Boston Red Sox’ recentWorld 
Series win, and later explained his 
sweatshirt featuring a picture of 
rapper Logic to a scrum of largely 
30-year-old-plus media reporters.
In terms of football-savvy ques-
tions and answers, there wasn’t 
much to learn. The confluence 
of football and success ironically 
leads to discussing anything but.
A week from now, with the 
Wolverines presumably sitting 
at 10-1 after beating the Hoosiers 
next Saturday, they will be a vic-
tory over Ohio State away from 
reaching the first of their goals — a 
Big Ten East Division champion-
ship. And a week from now, the 
tone will assuredly be different 
than it was Monday. But as it 
stands, Michigan has reached the 
apex of comfortability this season, 
and it showed.
So you probably don’t have to 
absorb much of what Harbaugh or 
his players said. But don’t forget to 
get a flu shot.

‘M’ competes at Oracle 
ITA Fall Championships

The Michigan women’s tennis 
team competed in the Oracle ITA 
Fall Championships — a five-day 
tournament in Surprise, Ariz. 
last week. The tournament was 
an elite event, composed only of 
regional finalists and marked the 
colse of the fall competition for 
the Wolverines. 
Michigan 
sent 
four 
team 
members to compete in the 
tournament 
— 
seniors 
Kate 
Fahey and Brienne Minor and 
juniors Chiara Lommer and 
Giulia Pairone.
“We 
were 
fortunate 
enough to have 
four girls make 
it into this event 
and 
compete,” 
said 
Michigan 
associate 
head 
coach 
Teryn 
Ashley-Fitch. “It 
definitely helped 
them 
to 
have 
their teammates 
competing next to them. I feel 
like it pushed the girls to really 
want to do well. So, even though 
it was an individual event, it 
almost felt like a team event.”
Fahey entered the tournament 
as a serious competitor. She came 
into 
the 
tournament 
having 
reached the 2018 Oracle ITA 
Masters semifinals and also 
ranked as the No. 11 seed in the 
singles draw.
Winning four back to back 
matches, Fahey advanced to 
Sunday’s finals. There, she lost to 
Georgia’s Katarina Jokic with a 
final score of 6-3, 7-5.
“Kate is just so mentally 
tough,” Ashley-Fitch said. “She 
practices at a very high level. She 
is so consistent with her effort 
everyday in practice, and it’s 
paying off.”
Fahey 
also 
competed 
in 

doubles with Minor. The pair was 
coming off a strong performance 
at the ITA Midwest Regionals, 
where they won the doubles title.
The pair won in the first round 
on Wednesday beating Florida’s 
doubles team, McCartney Kessler 
and Victoria Emma, 6-2, 7-6 (7). 
Then on Thursday, against a 
doubles team from UCLA doubles 
team, the duo fell (7-5, 6-3).
“Kate and Bri got a good win 
in the first round. When they’re 
good, I feel like they’re one of the 
best teams out there,” Ashley-
Fitch said. “They trust each other 
a lot on the court. There are still 
a few things we need to work 
on, like staying 
aggressive 
and being less 
predictable.”
In 
singles 
competition, 
Pairone 
and 
Lommer 
also 
competed. 
Pairone lost in 
the second round 
to 
Alabama’s 
Ann 
Daniell 
(2-6, 6-3, 6-1), and Lommer fell 
in the first round to Southern 
California’s Salma Ewing (7-5, 
4-6, 7-6 (2)).
Lommer, 
however, 
shined 
in the singles consolation play. 
Lommer cruised through the 
tournament to compete in the 
finals against Standford’s Emily 
Arbuthnott but lost to Arbuthnott 
with a final score of 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.
“Chiara had some quality 
wins,” Ashley-Fitch said. “She is 
so mentally sound, and I think 
she is going to play a huge part 
in our team season starting in 
January.”
The 
Wolverines 
certainly 
played 
up 
to 
the 
tough 
competition. 
The 
confidence 
and enthusiasm derived from 
this strong performance could 
certainly bleed into the team’s 
work ethic during winter play.

Michigan finishes 7th 
in 2018 Collegiate Cup

Its season may not start until 
January, 
but 
the 
Michigan 
women’s water polo team looked 
to make a preseason splash this 
weekend as it got back in the 
water for a five-game exhibition 
series at the 2018 Collegiate Cup in 
Irvine, Calif. The Wolverines were 
victorious against the University 
of Hawaii and Pacific Unversity 
but fell to the New York Athletic 
Club, Southern California and 
California, taking seventh in the 
tournament. 
Michigan 
coach 
Marcelo 
Leonardi 
emphasized 
the 
importance of exposing his team 
to high-caliber opponents in the 
preseason: “(It) provides high-
level competition in a November 
setting early on. If you want to 
play and compete with the best, 
the majority of the teams are from 
California ... it gives us a chance 
to travel and prep and go through 
something similar to in-season.”
Leonardi’s expectations for the 
Wolverines are high going into his 
fifth season as Michigan’s head 
coach. Last season, the Wolverines 
went 
32-9, 
won 
the 
CWPA 
Championship — its third straight 
— and made it to the quarterfinals 
of the NCAA Tournament.
With six returning starters 
this year, Leonardi will be looking 
towards some strong veteran 
leadership to push his team to new 
heights this year.
“This season, we are a little bit 
more seasoned in terms of age,” 
Leonardi said. “We bring a lot back 
from last year’s run.”
Led by three senior captains, 
attacker Julia Sellers — the 2018 
CWPA 
tournament 
MVP 
— 
utility Kim Johnson and attacker 
Delaney Cleveland, the team is 
eager to build off last season’s 
impressive finish.
Michigan began early Saturday 
morning against the New York 
Athletic Club. By halftime, NYAC 
led 5-4, with Melissa Seidermann 
and Michigan junior attacker 
Skylar Pyle each contributing two 
goals to their respective teams. 

However, NYAC pulled away in 
the second half and went on to 
score nine unanswered goals to 
defeat the Wolverines, 14-5.
In its second game of the 
day, Michigan faced off against 
the University of Hawaii. The 
Wolverines trailed the Rainbow 
Warriors 4-2 at the end of the third 
quarter but rallied to tie the game 
up 6-6 with two minutes left. A 
last-second goal by Pyle with only 
18 seconds remaining in the game 
gave the Wolverines the 7-6 win in 
an exciting, competitive battle.
“My teammates just did a great 
job setting me up (for the game-
winning goal),” Pyle said. “... We 
have 
been 
anxiously 
waiting 
to play games, we have been 
practicing since school started. 
Being able to see how we match up 
against really great teams has just 
been awesome.”
Michigan 
faced 
Southern 
California in its final Saturday 
matchup. Despite a valiant effort 
by the Wolverines, the Trojans 
came out victorious, defeating 
Michigan 
10-1. 
Southern 
California driver Paige Hauschild 
notched four goals en route to her 
team’s win.
On Sunday, the Wolverines 
first battled against the California 
Golden Bears in a high-scoring, 
back-and-forth 
matchup. 
Tied 
12-12 at the end of the fourth 
quarter, extra time was required 
to settle the contest. However, 
California defeated Michigan 4-2 
in the shootout.
In the Wolverines’ final game 
of the weekend, they faced Pacific 
University in the tournament’s 
seventh-place game. Four quarters 
once again could not settle the 
game, as the two teams were tied 
9-9 going into the shootout. This 
time, the Wolverines redeemed 
themselves, winning the shootout 
4-3.
“With each game, we are 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
comfortable,” Leonardi said.
Come 
regular 
season, 
the 
comfort gained from battling 
prime opponents in a competetive 
setting could prove vital to the 
team’s future success.

Matthews finding balance in style of play

For much of last season, 
redshirt 
junior 
Charles 
Matthews cast a frustrating 
figure for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team. The forward 
combined elite defense and 
athleticism with an inability to 
score consistently, especially 
outside the paint.
That version of Matthews 
returned just seconds into 
the Wolverines’ game against 
Holy Cross on Saturday night. 
Austin 
Butler 
spotted 
up 
for a seemingly uncontested 
3-pointer on the Crusaders’ 
first 
possession 
before 
Matthews 
appeared 
from 
out of nowhere to deflect his 
attempt out of bounds.
On the other end, it was 
Matthews’ turn to be stymied 
offensively. He attempted two 
of Michigan’s three shots on 
its first possession — both 
from the right wing, both 
uncontested and both rimming 
out.
The rest of the half was an 
unusual mix. He hit two threes 
and a long two but missed six 
field goals — all jump-shots — 
as the Wolverines went into 
halftime with just 18 points on 
five-of-24 shooting.
“We’re gonna have games 
like 
that,” 
Matthews 
said. 
“Especially early in the season, 
we’re still learning how to play 
with one another, we’re still 
learning how to attack certain 
defenses. So you can’t really 
get down about missed shots 
or anything like that. You just 
gotta continue to play.”
Matthews matched his first 
half point total after the break 
to finish with 20 on the day, 
but that was about the only 
similarity between the halves 
for Michigan. It outscored 
Holy 
Cross, 
38-13, 
in 
the 
second and upped its field goal 
percentage to 50 on 13-for-26 
shooting.
For 
Matthews, 
the 

difference was obvious.
For all the attention he 
receives as a player, Matthews 
prefers to avoid it off the 
court. He rarely goes off-script 
in press conferences, often 
stifling his voice to be barely 
audible. Saturday evening was 
much of the same — until a 
reporter asked him to explain 
the first-half struggles.
“We have a lot of athletes on 
this team, we got a lot of people 
that can put the ball on the 
floor,” Matthews said. “Coach 
is doing a great job coaching, 
coming 
up 
with 
offensive 
schemes, but sometimes we 
just gotta go.
“… And sometimes, I feel like 
we can be indecisive looking 
for the right time to score or the 
right shot to take and we miss 
shots cause we’re thinking, ‘Is 
this the time to shoot it?’ When 
we just hoop, we’re a different 

dynamic. We don’t have Moe 
and we don’t have Duncan, and 
those are great players. But we 
have players now that can put 
the ball on the floor and try 
to get to the basket, and I feel 
like we need to play to those 
strengths also.”
Getting downhill to the 
hoop is clearly a winning 
strategy for Matthews. Eight 
of his 10 second-half points 
came inside the paint, as did 
all five of his field goals in the 
opener against Norfolk State.
The 
Wolverines’ 
reliance 
on scoring inside makes them 
different than any team that 
coach John Beilein has ever 
had at Michigan. And much of 
that falls on Matthews.
“I feel like we have a team 
full of hunters, but me and 
Charles talk about it all the 
time, how we both need to be 
aggressive,” 
said 
freshman 

forward Ignas Brazdeikis, who 
finished just behind Matthews 
with 19 points on Saturday. 
“And we can play off of each 
other as well.”
Added 
Beilein: 
“They’re 
hunters and we just gotta 
continue on them being guys 
that shoot straight. I think 
Charles was 3-for-9 at one time 
and he’s gonna be better than 
that.”
But 
there’s 
a 
balance 
to 
playing 
aggressively 
in 
Beilein’s offense.
“Not 
putting 
your 
head 
down and going — that gets 
you subbed out,” Matthews 
said. “But looking to attack and 
staying aggressive.”
For an offense that lacks 
natural 
scorers 
that 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
become 
accustomed 
to, 
the 
entire 
season may rely on Matthews 
finding that balance.

Hailey Brown’s road back

February 
11, 
2018. 
Late 
fourth quarter. Michigan State 
64, Michigan 61.
As Wolverine center Hallie 
Thome draws a charge on a 
Spartan layup attempt, there’s 
a collision under the basket. 
Amidst 
the 
chaos, 
Hailey 
Brown falls to the floor and has 
to be helped off the court.
It 
would 
be 
her 
final 
appearance of the season.
Before 
suffering 
a 
bone 
bruise during that game, Brown 
had started 27 consecutive 
games and blossomed into one 
of the team’s most consistent 
contributors, averaging nine 
points and 5.2 rebounds per 
game. The injury forced Brown 
to 
watch 
the 
2018 
NCAA 
Tournament from the sidelines, 
in which the Wolverines fell to 
Baylor in the Round of 32.
“After I got the results from 
the doctor of the bad knee 
bone bruise, I couldn’t do 
any running or impact stuff,” 
Brown said. “…It was definitely 
tough to watch my teammates 
go out there and like live one of 
the dreams and goals that I’ve 

had.”
But despite this setback, 
Brown persevered and fought 
her way back over the course of 
the offseason. 
Early on in the recovery 
process, Brown was still able 
to lift weights, and eventually 
transitioned 
to 
using 
an 
underwater 
treadmill 
to 
stay in shape, which helped 
to 
alleviate 
weight 
when 
exercising. Eventually, Brown 
made a full recovery and played 
in the Mount St. Mary’s game 
on Nov. 8 — her first game since 
the injury.
After tip off, Brown picked 
up right where she left off in her 
stellar freshman season. She 
scored six of the Wolverines’ 
first 12 points and showed 
tremendous hustle early with 
two offensive rebounds on the 
game’s first possession. She 
finished with 12 points and 
seven rebounds, a performance 
made even more meaningful 
with her family in attendance.
“It was definitely special,” 
Brown noted.
“She’s worked so hard to 
come back after being injured 
last year, and she’s a really 
special player,” added Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico.
While it was a long road 
back to the court, Brown is 
now focused on this season 
and what the Wolverines can 
achieve. She’s said that one of 
her goals this year is to average 
a double-double, which both 
she and her coaches believe 
is a task that she is more than 
capable 
of 
accomplishing. 
However, Brown’s priorities 
are not solely on her individual 
accolades, but more so on what 
her team can achieve this 
season.
“I want national recognition 
for 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball this year,” Brown 
said. “I want our team to go far 
and stay up in the rankings.”
And after a season where 
the team reached the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since 2013, Brown feels that her 
team can achieve even greater 
feats this year.
“You always wanna achieve 
more,” she said. “Every time, 
every game, every moment 
you’re on the court, you’re there 
to prove something. Michigan 
women’s basketball, we’re here, 
we’re on a mission to prove that 
we can be champions.”

‘M’ falls to Indiana in Big Ten final

In the 72nd minute of the 
men’s soccer Big Ten Tournament 
Championship match, Indiana’s 
Griffin Dorsey sent a ball for 
service across the box, finding 
the head of the diving Hoosier 
midfielder Jeremiah Gutjahr, who 
converted for the goal. The perfect 
execution put the Hoosiers up 
2-0, a goal Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley said, “took the wind out of 
(the Michigan soccer team’s) sails,” 
as Daley’s team ultimately fell 3-0.
The 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
Championship has been unfamiliar 
territory for the Wolverines as 
of late. Michigan entered last 
season’s Big Ten Tournament as 
the highest-seeded team, boasting 
a 6-1-1 conference record, yet fell, 
4-0, in the semifinal to a fourth-
seeded Wisconsin team, who went 
on to win the tournament.
This year’s Michigan team 
avenged its loss to Wisconsin 
in the semifinals Friday, but fell 
victim to top-seeded Indiana in 
the tournament championship on 
Sunday.
Friday 
night 
against 
the 
Badgers, the Wolverines’ offense 
got off to a quick start. Their first 
opportunity came minutes into 
the game. Junior forward Jack 
Hallahan sent a ball in from the 
corner to the head of the 6-foot-
5 sophomore defender Jackson 
Ragen. 
However, 
Wisconsin’s 
goalkeeper Dean Cowdroy was 
there to save the would-be goal.
Michigan’s next corner kick, in 
the 20th minute, was again sent 
by Hallahan. The ball bounced 
once in the box before hitting 
a 
Badgers’ 
defender’s 
hand, 
resulting in a penalty kick for the 
Wolverines. Sophomore midfielder 
Marc Ybarra lined up across from 
the keeper with the opportunity 
to give Michigan the lead in the 
conference tournament semifinals. 
“When you step up to a penalty 
like that, you just keep your 
composure,” Ybarra said, “Take a 
deep breath and try to do what you 
do at practice all the time.”
And Ybarra did just that. He 
converted on the penalty kick, 
putting the Wolverines up 1-0 and 
in the driver’s seat for the rest of 
the game. From there, Michigan’s 

defense held firm. Of the four shots 
taken by the Badgers, none were 
on-goal. This made it an easy, clean 
sheet for sophomore keeper Henry 
Mashburn, as the Wolverines held 
on to win, 1-0.
“In the last game we played them 
… we were a little bit slow, a little bit 
off,” said Daley on Friday, “But this 
game, I think from start to finish 
we were highly competitive and, 
honestly, super motivated with the 
opportunity to compete for a Big 
Ten Championship on Sunday.”
And for the first time since 2012, 
the Wolverines found themselves 
in the Big Ten championship, 
facing off against Indiana, who 
welcomed back one of the nation’s 
top players, freshman midfielder 
Griffin Dorsey, for Sunday’s game. 
Dorsey returned to the team after 
representing the United States’ 
on U-20 CONCACAF national 
team, missing the beginning of the 
tournament.
“We had a good inclination that 
if they could bring back their top 
player, they would,” Daley said, 
“To compete with us and contend 
to win a Big Ten title, we thought 
they would bring back their best 
guy.”
And, as it turned out, Dorsey 
proved to be all the difference. In 
just the sixth minute of the game, 
Dorsey rifled a shot off a rebound, 
initially 
saved 
by 
Mashburn, 
but immediately converted off a 
rebound by Indiana forward Cory 

Thomas, giving Dorsey his first 
assist of the game.
Michigan tried to answer back 
quickly, but freshman forward 
Umar Farouk Osman’s shot just a 
minute later sailed over the goal 
and out of play. From there, it was a 
defensive battle, as Indiana ended 
the half clinging to the 1-0 lead.
In the second half, the Hoosiers’ 
offensive aggressiveness became 
too much for the Wolverines, as 
Gutjahr converted his header to 
double to lead.
Exactly two minutes later, 
Indiana 
iced 
the 
game 
and 
ended 
the 
Wolverines’ 
hope 
for a comeback when Hoosier 
midfielder Spencer Glass snuck 
the ball between the goalie and the 
post, putting Indiana up 3-0.
Although it wasn’t the ideal 
ending for Michigan’s tournament 
run, there’s still plenty of soccer to 
be played, as the selection for the 
NCAA tournament awaits later 
this week.
“I think we learned from 
Indiana and their approach,” 
Daley said, “The mentality today, 
I thought was really good… just 
staying on top of the game, being 
sharp early in the game… we [have 
to] treat it like a do-or-die situation, 
but we’ve been doing that for a 
month, so certainly it would be 
no different if we were afforded 
the opportunity to participate in 
the NCAA Tournament moving 
forward.”

Blankenburg uses forward 
experience for first goal

Less than five minutes into the 
third period on Saturday, Nick 
Blankenburg received the puck 
near the blue line.
The 
freshman 
defenseman 
skated forward, looking for his 
shot at the point. Instead, he 
noticed that the lane straight 
to the net was open — traffic 
had cleared from the prior puck 
movement.
So he took his chance and 
skated straight to the crease. Left. 
Right. Left. Right. He weaved the 
puck back and forth before finding 
the opening he was looking for — 
a hole in between the Notre Dame 
goaltender’s legs. 
Goal, Michigan.
Generally, 
when 
a 
player 
scores his first 
collegiate 
goal, 
the 
player 
remembers it. It’s 
a milestone, after 
all.
But 
Blankenburg, 
ironically, 
remembered everything but.
“I 
was 
just 
planning 
on 
shooting it,” Blankenburg said. 
“But then I saw a lane open, and I 
kinda just blacked out right when 
it happened.”
It was a stylish goal, to say the 
least. And the inspiration comes 
from Blankenburg’s time as a 
forward, a position he had played 
his entire life before his time with 
the Okotoks Oilers, his team prior 
to Michigan.
“You can tell he’s got some 
patience and some poise,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson, 
“and some quickness, can skate, 
he’s a converted forward, so he 
goes in and makes it look easy.”
On his first goal, Blankenburg 
not only made it easy, but 
showcased the versatility that he 
adds to the offensive zone.

“Hopefully that gives even 
more confidence,” Pearson said. 
“He’s been playing extremely well 
for us, and he’s got some offensive 
capabilities, and that gives us 
another option on the blue line 
that can create some offense from 
the backend.”
Blankenburg 
doesn’t 
have 
much experience as a defenseman 
under his belt. Seventy games 
at the blue line is nothing in 
comparison with many of the 
players he’s competing against. 
And he’s quick to admit that he 
doesn’t fully know all the in and 
outs of the position yet.
But the reason he’s able to hold 
his own is his confidence as a 
skater.
“I 
just 
feel 
like the biggest 
thing is skating-
wise, 
being 
a 
defenseman,” 
Blankenburg 
said. “It helps 
out so much, if I 
make a mistake, 
I can kinda back 
that 
up 
with 
my skating, just 
throughout this 
year.
“I mean, everyone can skate, 
especially at this level, so I just 
kinda play smart and use my speed 
to my advantage against the other 
guys, so that was nice to have that 
as a forward, and being able to 
transition that as a defenseman is 
nice.”
His speed was certainly put 
to use for his first goal. Once he 
reached the lane, no player was 
fast enough to clog it with traffic 
or put a man in his path to prevent 
the shot.
“And I feel like it’s really 
important being up at the blue 
line, and using my speed to be 
open and to get shots through 
from the point to be able to beat 
guys and get through to those 
shooting 
lanes,” 
Blankenburg 
said.
