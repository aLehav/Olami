longest streak of private-sector 
job creation in history,” he said. 
“More than 14 million new jobs; 
the strongest two years of job 
growth since the ’90s; an unem-
ployment rate cut in half. Our 
auto industry just had its best 
year ever.”

The White House recently 

announced plans for Obama to 
visit Detroit for the North Ameri-
can International Auto Show. 
Obama also visited a Ford Motor 
manufacturing plant prior to his 
2015 State of the Union address 
last year.

In a press release after the 

speech, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell 
(D–Dearborn) emphasized the 
importance of Obama’s mention 
of Detroit’s auto industry.

“We also must continue to 

innovate, which is why it was 
so important that the President 
highlighted the comeback of the 
auto industry,” she said. “As we 
saw at the North American Inter-
national Auto Show, Michigan is 
still in the driver’s seat when it 
comes to producing and design-
ing next-generation vehicles and 
I cannot wait to see the President 
there next week,”

Speaking to his actions on 

healthcare reform, Obama said 
the Affordable Care Act, passed 
in 2012, centers on ensuring cov-
erage for Americans when they 
need it most. In particular, he 
highlighted what he called the 
act’s main successes: job creation 
and slowing a rise in health care 
costs.

“It’s about filling the gaps 

in employer-based care so that 
when we lose a job, or go back 
to school, or start that new busi-
ness, we’ll still have coverage,” 
he said. “Nearly eighteen mil-
lion have gained coverage so far. 
Health care inflation has slowed. 
And our businesses have created 
jobs every single month since it 

became law.”

In an interview after the 

speech, Public Health Prof. Peter 
Jacobson said the most signifi-
cant achievements of the Afford-
able Care Act were the decrease 
in the number of uninsured peo-
ple and health care costs, as well 
as encouraging healthy behavior 
to keep people out of the hospital.

“The act if not directly, then 

implicitly, encourages healthcare 
providers to think outside the 
walls of the hospital to keep com-
munities healthy, and in the long 
run that is the most significant 
aspect,” he said.

He added that due to a gen-

eral public misunderstanding of 
what the Affordable Care Act has 
achieved, the president’s last task 
involving health care should be to 
educate about that through plat-
forms like the State of the Union.

“He and his administration 

can do a better job of explaining 
all of the benefits that the act has 
brought while recognizing its 
shortcomings,” Jacobson.

Along with discussing the 

Affordable Care Act, Obama also 
announced a national effort to 
combat cancer, which was met by 
applause from both sides of the 
aisle.

“Last year, Vice President 

Biden said that with a new moon-
shot, America can cure cancer,” 
he said. “Tonight, I’m announc-
ing a new national effort to get 
it done. And because he’s gone to 
the mat for all of us, on so many 
issues over the past forty years, 
I’m putting Joe in charge of Mis-
sion Control.”

Turning to the issue of nation-

al security, Obama noted the 
success of various international 
agreements such as the Iran 
nuclear deal — which aims to pre-
vent the country from acquiring a 
nuclear weapon — and the Paris

Schlissel’s push for 

strategic plan

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Approximately 
50 
Uni-

versity community members 
attended the first of three 
diversity forums slated to be 
held this semester as a part 
of University President Mark 

Schlissel’s diversity initiative 
Tuesday night.

Hosted by the Office of 

Diversity, Equity and Inclu-
sion, the forum featured a 
presentation 
on 
Schlissel’s 

strategic plan, followed by a 
question and answer session 
during which audience mem-
bers offered ideas for and cri-
tiques of the plan’s structure 
and focuses.

Rather than charging an 

executive team with dictat-
ing a course of action, Jackie 
Simpson, director of the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center and 

a member of the University’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
team, noted during the event 
that the initiative calls for stra-
tegic plans from 49 distinct 
campus units.

Each unit was appointed a 

planning leader, and should 
have conducted research on 
the state of internal diversity 
last semester according to the 
plan’s public timeline. This 
information, in addition to 
various town halls and focus 
group data, will be rolled into 
one University-wide strategic

POTUS highlights 
economic successes, 

looks to nation’s 

future

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

President Barack Obama high-

lighted the economy, healthcare 
and national security, focus-

ing not only on 2016 but also the 
future of the country for years 
to come, in his final State of the 
Union address Tuesday night.

In an interview after the 

speech, Communications Prof. 
Josh Pasek said the president’s 
focus during the speech was 
shaped by the fact that it was his 
last in office.

“The president is going to 

attempt to define his legacy in 
a way that he thinks will help 
shape the understanding of what 

policies he’s put in place through-
out his tenure in office,” Pasek 
said. “And in his view this will 
help encourage the future of the 
presidency to be one that main-
tains or upholds those policies.”

During his speech, Obama first 

addressed the economy, calling 
the United State’s economy the 
strongest in the world. He accred-
ited the country’s success to both 
job creation and the recovery of 
the auto industry.

Irvin scores 22 as 
Wolverines stun 
Maryland without 

Caris LeVert

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Before the Michigan men’s 

basketball team’s Tuesday night 
showdown with No. 3 Maryland, 
the students filling the Maize 
Rage stood, cheered and waved 
their thousands of blue LED glow 
sticks. But it’s hard to believe they 
were expecting too much from 
the game itself.

After all, the Wolverines were 

without senior guard Caris LeVert 
for the third straight game, and 
they were facing a lineup loaded 
with stars like preseason Big Ten 
Player of the Year Melo Trimble, 
versatile wing Jake Layman and 
highly touted freshman center 
Diamond Stone.

But two hours later, after a 

huge night from junior forward 
Zak Irvin, a first-half 3-point bar-
rage and a second-half reawak-

ening, the same students were 
waving the glow sticks in the 
air again after their Wolverines 
upset the Terrapins in a 70-67 
thriller.

“It just feels good to get this 

win today, against a really good 
team with a lot of weapons,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Everybody 
contributed, 
and 

I’m really happy for this team 
and our students. I really want 
(the students) to have this great 
experience of going to see a good 
basketball team, and for a lot of 
reasons, we haven’t been as good 
the last two years.”

The Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 

13-4 overall) jumped out to an 
early lead thanks to eight first-
half 3-pointers, but the Terrapins 
— led by Stone and his 22 points 
and 11 rebounds — used their size 
advantage to quickly get back into 
the game, tying it at 54 with 7:33 
remaining.

Though Michigan’s offense 

nearly collapsed in the second 
half with two scoring droughts of 
over three minutes each, it came 
back to life at the right time.

OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY

University bans hoverboards

Oklahoma State University 

recently joined dozens of schools 
in banning hoverboards — self-
balancing motor devices — in OSU 
housing. 

The O’Colly reported on a 

school-wide e-mail Friday detail-
ing the prohibition of hoverboards 
and the reasons behind this deci-
sion.

The e-mail cited a December 

2015 Consumer Product Safety 
Commission statement that 
warned consumers of safety 
defects to the hoverboard. Many 
hoverboards have caught fire 
while in use, causing serious inju-
ries.

Leon McClinton, the director 

of housing and residential life at 
Oklahoma State University, vowed 
to be as risk-averse as possible 

in regard to student safety. He 
said OSU could not afford to take 
chances with these potentially 
dangerous items.

Stanford researchers invent 

new battery 

The Stanford Daily reported 

Monday researchers at Stanford 
University have invented the first 
lithium-ion battery immune to 
overheating.Current models of 
lithium-ion batteries are often 
prone to overheating, thus causing 
fires in items such as cargo planes 
and hoverboards.

Zhenan Bao, Stanford professor 

of engineering, Stanford engineer 
Yi Cui and postdoctoral scholar 
Zheng Chen developed a system 
with a polyethylene film embed-

ded with nickel particles to com-
bat the safety hazard, according to 
the Stanford Daily. 

When the polyethylene film 

expands due to heat, the nickel 
particles spread apart and stop 
the electric current from flow-
ing, avoiding overheating and the 
subsequent problems associated 
with it. 

Many colleges that have 

banned hoverboards exclusively 
in residential halls are waiting for 
more information before banning 
them campuswide. If implement-
ed, Stanford’s explosion-proof 
battery may convince consumers 
and academics nationwide of the 
hoverboard’s safety, and may reig-
nite the hoverboard revolution on 
college campuses.

Federal judge rejects injunction 
to suspend Ann Arbor deer cull

CSG outlines budget, talks 
progress for second term

Plaintiffs requested 
temporary injunction 
due to public safety 

concerns 

By BRIAN KUANG and CAMY 

METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporters

A legal motion aiming to halt 

the city’s deer cull was shot down 
by a federal judge after a court 
hearing Monday afternoon.

In September, City Council 

approved a cull of up to 100 deer 
in response to concerns about 
the city’s growing deer popula-
tion. The move has prompted 
controversy,several protests and 
now, legal action.

The Detroit Federal District 

Court ruled against the plaintiffs 
of Sanzotta et al vs. City of Ann 
Arbor et al’s motion for a prelimi-
nary injunction — a legally bind-
ing court order granted before 
the resolution of a lawsuit — that 
would have compelled the city 

to stop its planned cull until the 
lawsuit is resolved. To receive 
such an order, the plaintiffs 
would have had to prove both 
that they were likely to win the 
suit and that irreversible damage 
would occur if it was not granted.

In addition, Justice Arthur 

Tarnow also declined to issue 
a temporary restraining order. 
Legal representatives from the 
city, Michigan state govern-
ment and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture — the department’s 
Wildlife Services is conducting 
the cull — were all present at 
the hearing to argue against the 
motion. Representatives from 
the plaintiffs were also present.

The judge gave the plaintiffs 

another week to submit a revi-
sion, to which the defendants 
would then be allotted 21 days 
to reply. However, the plaintiffs 
rejected the offer, and said they 
intended to withdraw their com-
plaints from federal jurisdiction 
and refile the case at the state 
level.

All three defendant parties 

claimed the plaintiffs met none of 
the criteria needed to be granted 
an injunction, and lacked stand-
ing to sue both the federal and 
Michigan governments.

Assistant U.S. Attorney The-

resa Urbanic, who represented 
the federal government, said the 
plaintiffs lacked legal foundation 
to win the suit in the response 
she filed with the court.

“(The) plaintiffs’ complaint 

runs nearly one hundred pages, 
asserts eleven different claims 
against a host of defendants, and 
includes a laundry list of con-
stitutional 
theories,” 
Urbanic 

wrote, referring to the lawsuit 
filed by the plaintiffs. “Mere rep-
etition of constitutional labels … 
cannot suffice to show a strong 
likelihood of success on the mer-
its.”

In an interview, Barry Powers, 

the attorney representing the 
plaintiffs, reiterated the position 
of his plaintiffs in response: that 
the cull carries active hazards for 
public safety and bypasses state 
laws, and that there had been no 
environmental assessment of the 
cull though such an assessment 
is federally mandated.

“Under what principle of law 

do they justify their activities?,” 
Powers said. “We’ve assumed 
that somebody would eventually 
step up and answer that ques-
tion. But so far all we’ve been met 
with are legal technicalities and 
assurances.”

Stephen 
Postema, 
Ann 

Arbor City Attorney, wrote in a 
response filed with the court that 
issuing an injunction to halt the 
cull would harm public interest 
and that no state laws were being 
bypassed.

“Allowing the cull to proceed 

does not damage, but actually 
furthers, the State policy permit-
ting municipalities to exercise 
their valid police powers to man-
age and control wildlife nuisanc-
es,” Postema wrote. “The City 
adopted the Deer Management 
Plan to alleviate these nuisances 
as a matter of public health, safe-
ty, and welfare.”

CSG President Cooper Charlton, an LSA senior, speaks at a CSG meeting in the Michigan Union on Tuesday.

Executives urge 
representatives to 
accomplish their 

campaign objectives

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

In their first session of the 

semester, Central Student Gov-
ernment reflected their perfor-
mance last semester and made 
plans for their budget Tuesday 
night.

CSG president Cooper Charl-

ton, an LSA senior, asked the 
body’s representatives to look 
inward when gauging the effec-
tiveness of the previous semes-
ter.

“I said three things at the 

beginning of the (fall) semester,” 
Charlton said. “That was confi-
dence, respect and execution.”

Cooper said to accomplish 

their objectives this semester, 
the assembly must trust and 
respect itself as a body. He said 
making goals a reality was some-
thing he had hoped to see more 
of in the fall semester.

“Execution looks like reflec-

tion: looking at yourself in the 
mirror and asking ‘What did I 
run on, have I done it,’ and actu-
ally answering that question 
honestly,” Charlton said. “We 
have one more semester to make 
it happen and I hope we can do it 
together.”

Speaking to accomplishments, 

Charlton highlighted the launch 
of u-clubs, a website he co-creat-
ed with LSA junior Aaron Jones 
designed to simplify communica-
tions between students and the 
student organizations on campus.

“It’s like a Craigslist for stu-

dent unions,” he said. “What it 
does is it takes Festifall and Win-
terfest and puts it online — some-
thing I’m very excited about.”

Budget plans
Business senior Kevin Ziegler, 

CSG treasurer, announced the 
budget for the winter semester. 
He highlighted the Student Orga-
nization Funding Commission’s 
successes in particular in allocat-
ing almost all of their funds in the 
previous semester.

“Their total from the semester, 

their absolute final was 99.85% of 
their $200,000 budget,” he said. 
“They came within $300 of their 
allotted amount.”

Speaking to the proposed bud-

get for the semester, Ziegler said 
he looked at where there had 
been leftover money and pro-
posed a shift in the distribution 
slightly, due to mandatory alloca-
tions and SOFC’s success.

“My personal goal is to extend 

as much money as possible that 
the students are paying us as long 
as they’re here at the University,” 
he said. “I’m proposing a 5 per-
cent increase to SOFC; this is, one, 
as a result to their tremendous 
result in the fall, in addition to a 
predicted increase in requests 
from student organization in the 
winter semester.”

CSG brought a resolution to 

the floor to enact their budget for 
the winter semester Tuesday, and 
a resolution to amend the com-
piled code’s budget allocation to 
the assembly floor.

Guest Speakers
Guest speaker Brittney Wil-

liams, chair of the Student 
Engagement 
Commission, 

addressed the assembly on the 
progress of the commission.

“We are trying to increase 

administration and University 
support for each of these demo-
graphics: international, transfer 
and non-traditional,” she said.

University rewards 
encourage healthy 
behavior in 
employees

According to a University press 

release, MHealthy announced 
the start of its annual rewards 
program, which aims to motivate 
faculty and staff members to 
better their health. From weight 
management and exercise classes 
to mental and emotional well-being 
classes, it provides participants 
with resources to reach this goal. 

After completing a health 

questionnaire, employees will 
receive $50 as well as a health 
report outlining helpful resources 
and information to encourage 
healthy behaviors in recipients.

The 2016 program introduced 

several new initiatives, including 
Learn to Live Tobacco Free 
Program and MHealthy personal 
training. 

Detroit auto show 
introduces drunk 
driving simulation

Ford’s Driving Skills for Life 

team introduced impaired driving 
simulations at the North American 
International Auto Show, reported 
MLive. Participants attempted to 
walk in a straight line and shoot 
basketballs in an arcade-style hoop.

The goal was to provide 

attendees with the opportunity 
to experience impaired driving 
without taking the road and putting 
themselves and others in danger. 

The drunk driving simulation 

consisted of suits made from braces 
strapped on attendees’ knees, 
elbows and neck, and weights 
wrapped around their wrists and 
ankles, according to MLive. 

Earmuffs and special goggles 

impaired hearing and vision. When 
simulating drug use, the goggles 
flash LED lights and a vibrating 
glove is added to the suit.

Driving Skills for Life visits 

different high schools and driving 
courses to discourage students 
from impaired driving and to train

decrease in state 
revenue

A report released by the House 

Fiscal Agency suggests net 
revenues in the state of Michigan 
will be $354.1 million less than 
projected in May for the 2015-
2016 fiscal year, the Detroit Free 
Press reported. For the 2016-2017 
fiscal year, combined revenues 
are expected to be down by 
$226.9 million.

The report offered one 

explanation for this downward 
trend: $112 million in business 
tax credits — originally meant to 
be cashed in during 2015 — will 
remain in Michigan companies 
until later this year. 

Although combined revenues 

are less than estimated, the 
general fund and School Aid 
Fund revenues were higher than 
expected. The report says the 
increase in the fund was also 
caused in part by higher-than-
expected income tax growth.

The report, along with two 

others, will be considered 
by state officials before the 
development of Gov. Rick 
Snyder’s (R) sixth budget.

film depicted a series of imag-
es that represented Locke’s 
stance on culture and race-
based attacks among citizens.

During the event, Locke 

said he made the film to show 
Black culture from different 
perspectives, specifically by 
connecting Black culture with 
trade relationships in China.

“This project takes a stance 

on the culture at large, but spe-
cifically Black culture,” Locke 
said. “It shows relationships in 
China on a global scale, such 
as trading oil, trading weap-
ons and what that means for 
people.”

The event also featured a 

panel discussion with three 
University faculty members: 
Education Prof. Robert Sellers, 
vice provost for equity, inclu-
sion and academic affairs, Law 
Prof. Amanda Alexander and 
Architecture Lecturer Craig 
Wilkins.

“I thought the panel was 

very engaging and I learned 
a lot,” Ngongi said. “I really 
didn’t know about the commu-
nity and the planning process 
for diversity.”

Sellers told the crowd that 

diversity was important in all 
fields, noting thinking about 
different 
perspectives 
can 

bring new ideas to the table.

“Sometimes, 
we 
assume 

the point of view that we are 
looking at is somehow truth 
or objective or the only way to 
look at it,” he said. “When one 
thinks about building perspec-
tives, we need to reinforce the 
notion to have as many differ-
ent points of view in play to 
help us develop the very best 
ideas.”

He also pointed to different 

majors as a source of different 

perspectives that can affect 
opinions and approaches to 
issues of diversity.

“If you don’t take into con-

sideration the different and 
unique experiences of individ-
uals, then you run the risk of 
designing a really nice beauti-
ful building that can do much 
more harm than good in terms 
of its usage,” Sellers said.

Sellers additionally cited 

the diversity strategic plan-
ning process currently under-
way on campus, in which 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
called 
upon 
the 

University’s colleges to cre-
ate plans to address diversity 
within their respective units. 
He said this planning process 
gives the opportunity for each 
school to improve inclusion.

“The nature of this Uni-

versity is such that, in any 
particular unit, some of the 
units will actually have the 
types of relationships in place, 
and there are others who 
haven’t,” Sellers said. “The 
planning process provides the 
opportunity to make those 
constituents 
develop 
those 

relationships and have input 
on how this University should 
work with diversity.”

Alexander, 
who 
works 

with the Inside-Out Prison 
Exchange Program, touched 
on how the University is relat-
ed to Detroit.

“We’re 45 minutes from the 

Blackest city in the US,” Alex-
ander said. “The question is 
how do we create access for 
Detroiters— make them not 
just feel included but wel-
comed, valued and cherished.”

She said many faculty mem-

bers don’t bring up diversity 
in their classrooms over con-
cern of being criticized for 
not addressing the topic with 
nuance.

“A lot of our colleagues are 

afraid,” Alexander said. “They 
are afraid to address ques-
tions of race or diversity in the 
classroom for fear that they 
will end up on a blog some-
where.”

Wilkins, 
a 
professional 

architect and urban design-
er who is the director of the 
Detroit Community Design 
Center, said architects should 
learn to collaborate and relate 
diversity with their designs 
because many individuals are 
not concerned with aesthetics.

“You have to talk to differ-

ent audiences and get specific 
in ways in which those tangi-
ble things mean something to 
you,” Wilkins said.

In an interview after the 

event, 
Rackham 
student 

Elinge Ngongi said the panel 
provided her with a unique 
view on her own Puerto Rican 
and Black heritage.

Urban Planning Prof. June 

Manning Thomas, who mod-
erated the event, said the 
aim was to create a space to 
address diversity and inclu-
sion.

“What we wanted to do is 

enter into a consultation about 
what the issues are of particu-
lar interest to Taubman Col-
lege faculty and students and 
the whole idea of diversity, 
equity, inclusion, as well as the 
legacy of Taubman,” Thomas 
said.

Rackham student Scott Fox, 

who is studying urban plan-
ning and helped organize the 
event, said he thought the con-
versation was both helpful and 
thought-provoking.

“It was a good experience 

to have faculty from various 
perspectives talk about the 
specific planning process and 
breaking down how we can 
make these conversations hap-
pen,” Fox said.

plan by next fall.

“At the end of the day, we will 

have down about 100 crowd-
sourcing sessions,” Simpson 
said. “This is starting bottom 
up.”

Many attendees at the event, 

however, were skeptical of the 
multifaceted design. Rackham 
student Oleta Johnson said 
when she approached her advi-
sors in the College of Pharmacy, 
they had no idea they were sup-
posed to be collecting the data.

“I see a lot of movement but 

no actual planning,” she said. 
“There’s a lot of emphasis on 
we’re going to talk to the stu-
dents and then do whatever. I 
also still don’t know how a lot of 
the faculty feel about this.”

Attendees also discussed a 

variety of diversity issues on 
campus, including hiring prac-
tices, gender inclusive bath-
rooms, mandating dialogues on 
race for incoming freshmen and 
expanding the Detroit Connec-
tor’s services.

Social Work student Mary 

Naoum said she thought the 
Connector was central to stu-
dent work toward advancing 
diversity.

The Connector was tem-

porarily discontinued in June 
2015, but has since beenrevived 
and is seeking grant funds for 
its continuation.

“Recently, in an effort with 

the School of Social Work to 
expand course opportunities 
in Detroit, I sent out a survey 
to my classmates and the feed-
back I got back about challenges 
to doing courses despite their 
interests was a lack of trans-
portation,” she said. “So it’s not 
just me, it’s not just students 
who live in Detroit, it’s students 
University-wide who want to 
do this work in Detroit, but are 
limited by transportation.”

A portion of the conversa-

tion also discussed questions 
raised in a Michigan in Color-
piece published Tuesday in 
The Michigan Daily. The piece 
criticized funding mechanisms 
for the the diversity initiative, 
charging that there are cur-
rently no funds allocated spe-
cifically to it.

In response to the piece and 

other related concerns raised 
at the event, Rob Sellers, vice 
provost for equity, inclusion 
and academic affairs, cited Uni-
versity resources that he said 
have already been allotted to 
diversity programs. He noted 
in particular the Trotter Multi-
cultural Center’s relocation and 
the Wolverine and HAIL schol-
arship programs.

He said ultimately, a defini-

tive budget for diversity-related 
initiatives could not and should 
not be determined yet.

“We don’t want to assign a 

dollar amount until the (diver-
sity) plan is in place,” he said. 
“We want the plan to drive the 
dollar amount, and to have a 
number doesn’t make sense for 
us without knowing what the 
actual plan is.”

Additional town halls are 

scheduled for this Wednes-
day and in coming weeks. The 
DEIT also announced during 
Tuesday’s event that they plan 
to organize more opportunities 
for students and faculty mem-
bers to contribute to the plan.

TOWN HALL

climate talks, which are the most 
substantial climate agreement 
since the 1992 Kyoto Protocol.

Obama also said foreign pol-

icy must focus on stopping the 
spread of global terrorist groups, 
while not wasting American 
resources.

“Priority number one is pro-

tecting the American people 
and going after terrorist net-
works,” he said. “We also can’t 
try to take over and rebuild 
every country that falls into cri-
sis. That’s not leadership; that’s 
a recipe for quagmire, spilling 
American blood and treasure 
that ultimately weakens us. It’s 
the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq 
— 

and we should have learned it by 
now.”

Domestically, the president 

announced a plan to travel across 
the country to raise support for 
policies that will increase coop-
eration within Congress.

“But, my fellow Americans, 

this cannot be my task 
 — 
or any 

President’s 
— 
alone,” he said. 

“There are a whole lot of folks 
in this chamber who would like 
to see more cooperation, a more 
elevated debate in Washington, 
but feel trapped by the demands 
of getting elected,” he said. “And 
over the course of this year, I 
intend to travel the country to 
push for reforms that do.”

Obama ended the address 

with a call to end partisan and 
other identity-based divisions 
within the country in order to 
uphold the American brand 
of democracy, but said he was 
hopeful about the future.

“That’s the country we love,” 

he said. “Clear-eyed. Big-heart-
ed. Optimistic that unarmed 
truth and unconditional love 
will have the final word. That’s 
what makes me so hopeful about 
our future. Because of you. I 
believe in you. That’s why I 
stand here confident that the 
State of our Union is strong.”

Looking at the upcoming 

legislative year, Pasek said he 
doesn’t think there is much 
Obama can do until after the 
election in November.

“He’s already doing a lot via 

executive orders and things of 
that sort,” he said. “But I don’t 
see much movement in Congress 
to pass things that are Obama-
like, at least before the election. 
After the election it’s possible 
that outgoing members of Con-
gress and Obama will be able to 
get some stuff done during the 
lame duck session.”

In reaction to the address, 

School of Information senior 
Madeline Jursek, chair of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, said while she dis-
agreed with the president’s for-
eign policy stances, there were 
several domestic policies that 
resonated with her.

“While I don’t agree with 

everything that Obama said 
tonight, as a millennial Repub-
lican, there were some policies 
that I agreed with, “ she said. 
“The idea of dedicating more 

resources to cancer research 
definitely resonated with me. 
One of the major policies that I 
did not agree with the president 
on is foreign policy and nation-
al security. I personally feel 
that we need to take a stronger 
stance against ISIS in order to 
protect our nation from future 
terrorist attacks.”

Public Policy senior Max 

Lerner, chair of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
said he appreciated the presi-
dent’s emphasis on civic engage-
ment.

“As young people, when we 

see legislators or governors or 
presidents doing things that 
we disagree with, a lot of it 
is because we don’t civically 
engage the way we should, we 
don’t vote at high enough rates, 
we don’t make our voices heard 
loud enough, and I think that’s 
part of what the president was 
calling for tonight,” Lerner 
said. “And what’s going to be so 
important heading into the 2016 
presidential election.”

marily concerned with deter-
mining whether the case fell 
under federal jurisdiction. She 
said his questioning and inves-
tigations served to evaluate 
this issue.

Sanzotta said Powers cited 

several legal reasons to sup-
port the motion being subject 
to federal jurisdiction in court, 
namely the USDA’s role in the 
deer cull as a federal agency.

She added that she was con-

cerned civil rights were being 
violated by the cull due to the 
court’s method of dismissing 
the case, and that public safety 
concerns remained.

“I’m sick about it in the very 

center of my being because I 
think it’s a horrible bloodbath 
that is unnecessary,” Sanzotta 
said. “I’m afraid for my own 
family; we use the parks all the 
time.”

Williams illustrated the 

accomplishments made last 
semester, which included get-
ting an international student 
advisor on staff at the Newn-
an Center, and conducting 
research on international stu-
dents’ transition into student 
housing as well as their feel-
ings about social inclusion.

She also discussed her com-

mission’s goal for the semester 
to expand resources to nontra-
ditional students.

“We’d like to hire a nontra-

ditionals advisor to Newnan, 
similar to what the transfers 
have done,” she said. “Or at 
least designate a current advi-
sor to nontraditional student 
needs, establish a transfer 
student scholarship, at least 
in LSA, we are also planning 
an international student job 
fair that’s to take place in fall 
of 2016.”

Plans moving forward
CSG representatives also 

outlined the progress of initia-
tives from last semester and 
discussed election dates for 
the upcoming semester.

Public Policy junior Thom-

as Hislop, a CSG represen-
tative, spoke about plans to 
launch the Prescription Drug 
Misuse Campaign, a project 
proposed last semester to 
draw student awareness to the 
dangers of drug use on cam-
pus. 

The launch is expected to 

occur between March 6 and 
12.

“The idea so far is to have a 

video with student advocates, 
and students for recovery have 
been great with working with 
us, pledge boards, we’re going 
to have expert panelists, we 
are also going to have a media 
campaign,” Hislop said.

H

ow can we do the serious 
work of educating our-
selves politically when 

there’s 
such 

great 
stuff 
to 

watch on Netflix 
and Hulu?

Today 
the 

news media often 
has to compete with the likes of HBO 
GO and YouTube for our attention, 
because if it fails to capture us within 
the first 15 seconds, then we switch 
tabs on our web browsers and watch 
or read something better, something 
that’s more entertaining.

No 
wonder 
the 
mainstream 

news media covers presidential 
campaigns as if they’re unfold-
ing political dramas. No wonder 
they try to provoke the candidates 
to “attack,” “slam,” “go after” and 
(ahem) “schlong” one another, as 
if presidential debates were WWE 
wrestling matches,or episodes of 
the “Real World.” Or, as Trump 
would have it, misogynist pornos. 
No wonder the mainsteam media 
habitually presents the candidates 
less as leaders advocating policies 
and more as heroes on their own 
personal, lifelong journeys.

And how else can the news media 

compete with the entertainment 
media other than for the former to 
play the latter’s game (entertain-
ment)? Today the news media isn’t 
just trying to inform us — I suspect 
that’s not even their chief goal — 
they are trying to entertain us. And 
that’s a big problem for democracy.

Perhaps this isn’t news to many 

of you, especially the Communica-
tion Studies majors, but it’s a point 
worth revisiting during each elec-
tion season.

Today, many of us want to be 

politically active without the activ-
ity, the same way many of us want 
coffee without the caffeine, cream 
without the fat, beer without the 
alcohol, warfare without the war-
fare (e.g., drones) and, in short, 
as philosopher Zizek puts it, “ … a 
whole series of products deprived 
of their malignant property.”

How does the market respond 

to our demand for political activ-
ism without the activity, without 
the work? The mainstream media 
supplies us with political entertain-
ment, including everything from 
comedy news shows like “The Daily 
Show with Trevor Noah” and “Last 
Week Tonight” to political dramas 
like “The West Wing” and “House 
of Cards,” to Bill O’Reilly, to the 
Republican presidential debates, to 
an article about Trump’s alcoholic 
brother in the Times, etc. (Have you 

noticed how the sets for the Demo-
cratic and Republican debates look 
highly similar to the “American 
Idol” sets? Is that an accident?)

These commodities allow us to 

feel like we’re participating in poli-
tics and doing the work of educat-
ing ourselves politically without 
actually seriously participating or 
working. With this entertainment, 
we experience politics without 
actually doing politics.

Political entertainment requires 

little to no work on our part (the 
audience’s part) because, like most 
entertainment, it allows, and in fact 
requires, the audience to be most-
ly passive. The video or TV show 
does the intellectual work for us, 
much like canned laughter on old 
sitcoms laughs on our behalf, fool-
ing us into finding jokes funny that 
really aren’t. That is, when we’re in 
the passive, receptive state of being 
entertained, we’re willing to accept 
certain information as news, as 
fact, as self-evident and so on, that 
we might not accept when we are in 
the active mental state of reading, 
analyzing, interpreting, etc.

These 
entertainments 
co-opt 

our desire to laugh or politically 
engage. Often, the jokes aren’t that 
funny and the news isn’t that news-
worthy. And this, too, poses prob-
lems for democracy.

Maybe you’re thinking, “Who 

cares if the news is entertaining? I 
like to be entertained. Stop trying 
to yuck my yum!”

The danger in this news enter-

tainment business is multilayered. 
When we trade doing political activ-
ity for being political entertained, we 
sacrifice some of our agency as criti-
cal thinkers and engaged citizens. 
When we decline to do the work of 
educating ourselves politically, and 
instead quell, pacify, placate or mol-
lify our enduring drive for political 
involvement by having someone else 
do the work for us (via entertain-
ment), we risk being misled. We are 
probably less apt to notice when and 
how we’re being misled with the 
information we’ve received because 
we’ve received the information in 
the passive state of being entertained 
instead of the active state of, say, 
reading and studying.

I’m of course mostly generalizing 

and speculating here. For example, 
I personally have learned impor-
tant stuff from watching episodes of 
“Vice” and videos on YouTube, but I 
would say that shows like “Vice” are 
the exception rather than the rule, 
and they aren’t always that excep-
tional.

I’m not saying the mainstream 

media is entertainment all the time. 
TV media generally entertains more 
than, say, The New York Times, but 
the mainstream media participates 
in this news business sometimes; 
and when the Times does, it’s often 
more insidious because it is enter-
taining behind the highbrow mask 
of sophistication.

Look, I’m not suggesting we all 

do journalism or scholarship. I’m 
not even really trying to convince 
you of anything. (Maybe you think 
I’m being facetious, but I’m not.) I 
believe my observations are true 
and analyses plausible, and if they 
are true (and plausible), then I sus-
pect they’ll ring true (and plausible) 
for you, too. Or, if the stuff I’m see-
ing and saying appears strange or 
unfamiliar, and hence rings nei-
ther true nor false, look at yourself. 
(I’m not everybody.) Citizenship in 
democracy requires work — a tru-
ism, to be sure, but a useful one to 
remember — especially in a culture 
that so often promotes political 
apathy and cynicism over activ-
ism and participation. When many 
of us decline this important work 
of citizenship, we neglect a part 
of ourselves (a part of our souls?) 
that wants political activity — that 
wants to participate in the polis. 
When we allow this part of the 
soul to do the political work that it 
wants to do, and stop placating it 
with unwholesome entertainment 
substitutes, the work ultimately 
crowns us with eudaimonia. 

I look around campus and I see 

most of us working pretty hard in 
school, so how can I fault us for 
preferring to kick back and watch 
TV in our free time instead of doing 
the work of educating ourselves 
politically? I should mention that 
I definitely don’t abstain from the 
political entertainment that I’ve 
been criticizing (nor do I advo-
cate total abstinence). Besides the 
human who shares a bedroom with 
me, I am my own primary object/
subject of study. And yet, if we 
ignore how the maintream media 
tries to appeal to us as passive con-
sumers of entertainment — that is, 
if we ignore how the mainstream 
media tries to entertain us in addi-
tion to informing us — we risk 
becoming passive citizens of a 
passive democracy, and a passive 
democracy is no democracy at all 
(which is not to say democracy is 
a system I’m ready to advocate for 
either — I’m just assuming you all 
are fans).

We all have things we think suck on cam-

pus. Many students simply rant to their friends 
or internalize their concerns. Most don’t real-
ize there is an avenue to voice their complaints 
and bring about real results to their issues.

A request for more bike parking at Palmer 

Commons, a request to expand the availabil-
ity of covered bike parking on campus and a 
request for installing more bike repair sta-
tions: Other than the obvious fact that these 
are all about bikes, what do they have in com-
mon? Each was a concern students expressed 
in multiple e-mails sent to LSA Student 
Government’s “this sucks” e-mail service 
last semester. Thissucks@umich.edu is an 
e-mail address created for the student body 
to directly communicate changes they’d like 
to see on campus.

As a frequent biker on campus, when I saw 

an e-mail about the limited number of bike 
parking spaces in front of Palmer Commons, I 
decided to take on the project. I reached out 
to some connections in Facilities, and less than 
two weeks after the Student Life Committee 
meeting where I took up the project, I was 
meeting with Steve Dolen, the University’s 
director of parking and transportation, to dis-
cuss the issue.

During our meeting, it quickly became 

apparent that a huge underlying obstacle for 
bicycle parking was the number of abandoned 
bikes on campus. According to Dolen, approxi-
mately 25 percent of all bikes parked on cam-
pus are abandoned bikes. The cost of adding 
that many more parking spots would be hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars. I left that meet-
ing with a project, albeit slightly different than 
the one we started with, but nonetheless an 
important one: to reduce the number of aban-
doned bikes. I am still working on how we can 
do it, but the thought and effort is being made.

Students often do not have the time or the 

resources to push for the changes they would 
like to see on campus. LSA Student Govern-
ment exists to be the voice of the LSA student 
body. It is our responsibility to engage with 
students to find out what issues and projects 
they think would be most impactful for us to 
work on.

This past Sunday marked the 10th anniver-

sary of this e-mail system service for the stu-
dent body. We really have made a difference 
on campus with your help over the years from 
these e-mails — buses have increased their 
route frequency, bathrooms have been redone 
and minors in religion and entrepreneurship 
have been implemented, just to name a few.

On another occasion, two of our elected 

representatives were inspired by a “this 
sucks” e-mail titled “The Ugly Truth About 
the UGLI,” which pointed out a need for a 
feminine hygiene product dispenser in the 
Shapiro Undergraduate Library. Within a 
few weeks, a meeting had been secured, 
money had been found and the idea was 
implemented. These same representatives 
are now working with University Health Ser-
vice to provide feminine hygiene products for 
free, as is done with condoms.

When it comes to thissucks@umich.

edu, no issue is too large or too small for us 
to address, and we promise to answer every 
e-mail. We will do everything in our power 
to address your concerns and work to build 
a better University for everyone. If you’d like 
to help LSA-SG celebrate 10 years of problem 
solving, send us your issues and concerns at 
thissucks@umich.edu. Your problems are our 
projects, and that’s how we like it.

Replacing newspapers

“H

as anyone ever seen one of 
these before?”

My class laughs a bit as my 

professor holds it up. It’s a 
beautiful work of art, filled 
with 
stories, 
pictures, 

people and places. There’s 
both triumph and failure, 
coupled 
with 
laughter 

and sadness, along with 
hope 
and 
horrors, 
all 

put together to make the 
folded 
broadsheet 
the 

masterpiece it is.

“This is a newspaper. 

You read stuff in it.”

He knows he’s being 

facetious. Yes, everyone in this class of 
computer science majors has seen a newspaper 
before. Even in a class of technophiles, the role 
of the newspaper might change, but its history 
does not.

“How many of you still read a newspaper?”
Not a single other hand goes up. It’s not 

particularly surprising, as daily newspaper 
readership fell to 17 percent in the 18 to 24 
age demographic in 2014, and certainly a class 
called Mobile Application Development and 
Entrepreneurship is full of students more 
likely to read from a screen than from print. 
But the conclusions are stark: Not one of my 
classmates will pick up a printed copy of this 
edition of The Michigan Daily to read my 
column or anything else in it. Nor will they 
pick up anything else off newsstands.

He then read the article he intended to 

share, regarding General Motors investing 
$500 million in Lyft, noting its placement 
on the front page as a sign of its importance. 
Terms such as “above the fold” and “below 
the fold” were familiar to someone like me 
with experience in newspaper jargon, yet the 
science of guiding the eyes of the reader along 
the page has seemingly faded away like the ink 
of old papers. The role of print media, while 
not disappearing yet, is becoming drastically 
different, driven by the behaviors of our 
generation.

When our professor asked where we 

get our news, web-driven content was the 
predominant answer; social media sites such 
as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the content 
aggregation site Reddit have become delivery 
platforms for news sources. The online edition 

of The New York Times was mentioned, as was 
CNN and web-only content providers like The 
Huffington Post. It’s not that millennials don’t 
consume news: 69 percent of them still read 
the daily news. But the medium has changed: 
The sources aren’t print, and the information 
comes from a breadth of sources far greater 
than a local paper.

It’s a strange scenario even for someone like 

me, whose job as a columnist at The Michigan 
Daily has also become replaceable. Anyone 
can set up a blog, post their own writing and 
become their own self-employed columnist as 
a hobby, or with some luck and talent, watch 
it blossom into a full-time job. Even those 
unwilling to set up their own blogs can submit 
any content they wish to syndicated blog sites 
and become published writers. It is clear that 
journalism is no longer monopolized by the 
print industry.

The newspaper has always been tangibly 

impressive, with tremendous physical value 
even with the advent of web-based news. 
Framed in my house, along with other 
Michigan memorabilia, are the front pages of 
the Detroit Free Press from the 1989 Michigan 
basketball national championship and the 
1997 football championship. Not only is there 
historical importance in these events — there 
is also personal importance in newspapers. 
My grandfather has framed the newspaper 
announcing the wedding of his parents, and 
the clippings of mentions of my siblings and 
me in the local paper were always saved by my 
parents. Newspapers are icons of the stories 
that make up our world.

Even though the future of print paper is in 

jeopardy, there’s no reason to believe that the 
societal mission newspapers carry is in the 
same peril. Just as music made the transition 
from physical to digital, so will the news.

There’s some sadness in the change; the 

prospect of the annual trip in which graduating 
seniors visit the printer to see issues of The 
Michigan Daily rolling off the presses could 
be replaced with a trip to the server room to 
see a bunch of computers hosting the content 
is a strange scenario. But whether in hard 
drives and web databases or printed in ink, the 
artistry of the words remains. Journalists type 
and write, because the stories around us need 
to be told.

f I ask you to tell me about 
Adam McKay’s 2010 film 
“The Other Guys,” you’ll 

probably tell me it’s a buddy-
cop 
film 

starring 
Will 
Ferrell 
and Mark 
Wahlberg. 
You might 
recount 
the cameos 
from 
Samuel L. 
Jackson 
and 
The 

Rock as hypermasculine cops 
who absent mindedly jump 
off a building to their deaths 
in a less than heroic attempt 
to catch a perp. Perhaps you’ll 
remember 
Michael 
Keaton’s 

pretty hilarious turn as a police 
chief by day, Bed, Bad & Beyond 
floor manager by night. But you 
probably don’t remember much 
about the villain. It’s not the 
English mercenaries with guns 
and bad attitudes — they’re the 
antagonists. Steve Coogan plays 
the villain: a banker. It’s his 
bumbling attempt at covering 
investment losses that draws 
the antagonists in.

So 
it’s 
really 
not 
too 

surprising that the guy who 
brought us such comedy gold as 
“Anchorman” and “Talladega 
Nights” also brought us the 
most biting and, in my opinion, 
one of the more important films 
to come out in the last few years 
with “The Big Short.” It’s a 
movie that walks a very fine 
line 
between 
entertainment 

and education and succeeds on 
both fronts. The goal, I think, 
is to laugh for two hours, and, 
in the last five minutes, to get 
angry, fuming even.

But with whom are we 

supposed to be angry? The 
Banks, of course! Those crooks 
on Wall Street!

No, it’s not that simple.
Let’s examine the other big 

bank movie that most people 
(myself included) thought “The 
Big Short” would ultimately 
be: “The Wolf of Wall Street.” 
These are actually two very 
different movies; Where “The 
Big Short” focuses on hedge 
fund 
managers, 
“The 
Wolf 

of Wall Street” follows the 
investment bankers themselves. 
For three hours, we are seduced 
by this Wall Street life of excess 
and luxury and opulence. Even 
if you despise the movie, you 
can’t help but marvel a little 
bit at how much fun all these 
people had. All the drugs, the 
sex — even Jonah Hill looking 
his absolute worst can get some 
— and nothing ever goes wrong. 
Ever.

The point, of course, in 

flashing all this excess is to 
show just how irresponsible 
and ego-driven these people 
are, right? Wrong. The key is in 
the very last shot. Go watch it — 
I’ll wait.

That last shot is 24 seconds 

long, 
and 
it 
captures 
an 

audience. But it’s not just any 
audience — it’s you, you who 
desires wealth and power and 
influence just as much as the 
next guy, you who wants success 
with the minimal amount of 
effort. Look at these faces — 
they’re 
enthralled, 
they’re 

eating up Jordan Belfort’s coke-
dusted, slimy words. This man 
robbed them, he robbed you, but 
you’re fascinated, mesmerized 
and you yearn for a piece of his 
success.

“The Wolf of Wall Street” 

exists to remind you that guys 
like Jordan Belfort continue to 
thrive and that it’s up to you 
to be seduced by them or rise 
against them. But I think the 
movie itself seduced a lot of 
people, and its message got lost 
in a Quaalude-induced haze.

Which is why it’s appropriate 

“The Big Short” was released 
only two years after “Wolf.” It’s 
a second attempt at a similar 
message, only this time it’s far 
more blunt about it.

Rather than have a character 

break the fourth wall and 
directly tell the audience how 
much of a scumbag he/she 
is, as Leonardo DiCaprio did 
as Belfort in “Wolf,” McKay 
very smartly has celebrities 
playing themselves address the 
audience. “You didn’t listen the 
first time, “ McKay might have 
said. “So here’s Margot Robbie 
in a bathtub to explain it to 
you.” Well it got my attention, 
and the attention of every other 
individual in a packed theater 
on a Saturday night, regardless 
of gender or age.

McKay 
does 
the 
heavy 

lifting for us, witling down a 
very complicated issue (and 
certainly 
more 
complicated 

than the film suggests) into 
the bare bones so that we the 
plebeians can understand just 
how badly we got screwed over. 
So by the end of the movie, we 
are supposed to have laughed 
at the absurdity of it all, and 
then we’re supposed to get 
angry. “How could they do this? 
How inhumane!” we mumble 
to ourselves or exclaim to our 
friends and family as we exit 
the theater.

But that’s still not the whole 

story.

Because 
you’re 
forgetting 

that 
we’ve 
been 
spoon-fed 

information to make sure that 
we get it this time. And you’re 
also forgetting that we have 
seen clips of us plebeians living 
our lives, being completely 
ignorant of our own stupidity. 
Take, for example, the father 
of two who doesn’t check 
to make sure his landlord is 
making regular payments to 
the bank, or the stripper who 
takes out mortgages with zero 
money down on five homes and 
an apartment. The banks may 
have screwed them, but they let 
themselves get screwed.

I saw “The Big Short” with 

my family over winter break, 
and as we left the theater, I 
heard exclamations of anger. 
Many in the audience didn’t 
even get out of their seats, as 
though petrified by their rage. 
And as I sat with my family 
at dinner that night, as we 
discussed the movie, I said to 
them, “The biggest joke of that 
movie is, two days from now, 
none of these people will care 
or remember their anger or why 
they were angry in the first 
place.”

And I’m fairly certain I’m 

right, because people should 
be outraged, and they should 
be even more outraged that not 
only has nothing changed in the 
eight years since the collapse, 
but that the banks are bigger.

And 
we 
simply 
cannot 

forget that anger and betrayal, 
because 
there’s 
a 
primary 

election 
fast 
approaching 

and there’s a particular, very 
popular candidate who is very 
pro-Big Bank and blames the 
2008 
collapse 
on 
“shadow 

banks,” like AIG, as opposed 
to the actual banks that caused 
the actual problems (hint: four 
of her career top five donors 
are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, 
JPMorgan Chase and Morgan 
Stanley).

I never expected the public 

to have a “Network”-style “I’m 
mad as hell, and I’m not going to 
take it anymore!” moment after 
seeing “The Big Short,” but I 
did expect a little more than 
awards speculation. Where’s 
the outrage? I can’t even find 
a wayward Tumblr warrior 
ranting about it. 

My 
point 
is 
this: 
“The 

Big 
Short” 
is 
more 
than 

entertainment — it’s a history 
lesson that doubles as a slap in 
the face to remind us just how 
badly we as a nation, not just 
Wall Street, screwed up. There 
are more educational, better 
researched and more academic 
media that better explain the 
heart of the 2008 collapse (the 
documentary “Inside Job” is 
a great place to start — Matt 
Damon narrates, if that helps. 
As is the book “The Big Short.”), 
but “The Big Short” is an 
accessible entry point that gets 
the job done.

To deny that we have a part 

to play, to feign ignorance, is 
painfully foolish. Go see “The 
Big Short.” Laugh, have a good 
time. And then let the pain sink 
in. And then get angry. Because 
if you don’t soon, when the next 
recession hits in the next 10, or 
15, or 20 years, if not sooner, 
it’ll be too late. And I really 
don’t think we need another 
film about the collapse of the 
American economy.

‘American Idol’ gives 
fans a final farewell

FOX

It’s Jenny from the block!!!

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

I was late to the “American 

Idol” train. I didn’t see Kelly 
Clarkson win the singing com-
petition during 
its first season 
on FOX, nor did 
I watch Car-
rie Underwood 
rise in season 
four while still 
using 
a 
hair 

crimper.

I tuned in 

with the rest 
of America in 
2008. It was 
the seventh season of “Idol,” 
with the holy trinity of judges 
still present (Simon Cowell, 
Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul; 
a.k.a. bad cop, lukewarm cop and 
overly good cop). I was trans-
fixed. My eighth grade friend 
group watched religiously each 
week, our fingers poised over 
cordless phones to six-way call 
each other when something 
huge 
happened 
(OMG, 
he’s 

singing an acoustic version of 
Michael Jackson!!!) and to dial 
in votes for our favorites at the 
end of the show, punching their 
digits with surgical precision.

It was all very dramatic. 

Debates over which David was 
better — David Cook or David 
Archuleta, the two finalists in 
season seven — got heated at 
the lunch table, on the “Today 
Show” and in every tabloid 
magazine. At the season finale, 
“Idol” received over 97 million 
votes from viewers, the highest 
recorded number in the show’s 
history. Cook won over Archul-
eta by a margin of just 12 million 
votes. We cheered, we cried.

And then? “American Idol” 

fell hard.

The trinity broke up: Paula 

was first to go, leaving the judg-
ing panel after season eight. 
Simon, the group’s loved and 
hated leader (let’s be honest, 
his merciless commentary was 

really why we all watched the 
show), left in 2010. Randy, argu-
ably the most useless judge (his 
go-to advice: “Dawg, you’ve got 
to sell it”) held on until season 
13, long after the show ratings 
had plummeted. New judges 
filled in — Nicki Minaj, Mariah 
Carey, Steven Tyler, Kara Dio-
Gardi, even Ellen Degeneres 
took a turn — but like a Defense 
Against the Dark Arts professor 
at Hogwarts, no one stayed for 
long.

Despite host Ryan Seacrest’s 

apparent 
immortality, 
the 

show died. In May 2015, FOX 
announced that “American Idol” 
would run for a final season 15, 
dubbed the “Farewell Season.” 
Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick, 
Jr. and Keith Urban would make 
up the season’s judging panel, 
with past “Idol” winners helping 
weed out the good and the bad at 
auditions.

Following tradition, the Janu-

ary premiere was spread out 
over two nights, but the audi-
tion process this year seems to 
be in overdrive: “Idol” show-
cased not one, but four cit-
ies, including Atlanta, Denver, 
San Francisco and Little Rock. 
Where Atlanta auditions alone 
used to fill two episodes, the 
cities are now distilled into 
45-minute segments of Golden 
Ticket 
winners 
(contestants 

who are approved to advance 
to Hollywood). The auditions 
were all the same: solid perfor-
mances, but a startling lack of 
funny/absurd/terrible tryouts. 
No hilarious “Pants On the 
Ground” guy (Larry Platt, sea-
son nine) or even an irritating 
“Bikini Girl” (Katrina Darrell, 
who auditioned in her bikini 
in season eight). Maybe “Idol” 
is trying to get artistic respect 
in its last days by cutting epic 
fails?

Here’s who they found: good 

singers with gripping backsto-
ries. Lee Jean, a 15-year-old 
whose brother died in 2012, 
stole the show in Atlanta with 

Ed Sheeran’s “I See Fire,” 
prompting J-Lo to squeal, “I 
just want to squeeze you!” Jor-
dan and Alex Sasser, an overly 
cheerful married couple, audi-
tioned in Denver together with 
a baby in tow, though only 
Jordan walked away with a 
ticket (leaving a very uncheer-
ful Alex). In Little Rock, Dal-
ton Rapattoni, wild-eyed and 
dressed like he was plucked 
from a Green Day music video, 
wowed with an indie-rock ver-
sion of “The Phantom of the 
Opera.”

But the biggest surprise came 

in San Francisco, when some 
guy named Kanye West hit the 
stage, his girlfriend Kim Kar-
dashian waiting expectantly 
outside. No, seriously. Kanye 
delivered an a capella version 
of “Gold Digger” and (shocker) 
got a Golden Ticket from the 
judges, making him probably 
the only person to announce his 
plans to run for presidency and 
audition for “Idol” in the same 
year.

Has 
“American 
Idol” 

changed? Yes and no. Look-
ing past the sob stories and 
J-Lo’s boy crush favoritism, 
there’s still some undeniable 
singing talent among contes-
tants. The show hasn’t failed 
because people can’t sing any-
more — “Idol” is just not catchy 
enough. There’s no meanness or 
sexual tension (looking at you, 
Paula and Simon) on the judg-
ing panel; no more atrocious 
auditions that become viral hits 
overnight. Cameras don’t fol-
low angry rejected contestants 
down the hall. Ryan Seacrest 
doesn’t even flirt anymore.

The bottom line is, “Ameri-

can Idol” is boring. It isn’t an 
epic fail in quality, but the 
show’s utter blandness and pre-
dictability make it impossible 
to watch. Still, I’ll give my old 
favorite the benefit of the doubt 
in its early stages — maybe one 
more star will come from it yet.

In West Philidelphia, born and raised. 
‘Concussion’ too 
reliant on symbolism

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

This biographical sports film 

brings to the public’s attention 
the true story of the controver-
sial research 
done 
by 

forensic 
pathologist 
and medical 
examiner 
Dr. 
Ben-

net 
Omalu 

(Will Smith, 
“Focus”). 
The 
research 
concludes 
football 

players can suffer long-term 
mental 
health 
issues 
from 

repeated head trauma. Unfortu-
nately, the weak characteriza-
tion generates more sympathy 
for the Nigerian doctor himself 
than the ill football players he 
studies, lessening the dramatic 
impact of his discovery.

Omalu’s desire to be suc-

cessful in the United States is 
what underpins the story while 
taking the focus away from its 
subject. The film ignores the 
National 
Football 
League’s 

role in hiding the suffering of 
its players by instead focusing 
on the doctor’s strong attach-
ment and high regard for the 
country, inciting both pride 
for his inspired success and 
shame for his rejection from 
the American scientific com-
munity. All the while, it ignores 
the principal entity that is 
fighting against his work. The 
way he modeled his goals after 
his superiors even though they 
have diversely different back-
grounds illustrates how he was 
not cognizant that his race and 
origin could hinder his career. 
This builds our sympathy for 
the naive character when his 
research is dismissed by his 
peers not only for having for-
eign credentials but for being 
so un-American by attacking 
the nation’s most popular sport. 
Though he becomes a sympa-
thetic protagonist as a result, it 
turns the film into a chronicle 
of Omalu’s personal struggles 
that barely touch on the tragic 
deaths of the football players 
that fueled his work.

The prominent role of his 

deep faith, on the other hand, 

renders him a two-dimensional 
hero. The crosses in his house, 
Bible on his nightstand and 
inability to let loose at a club 
when celebrating the publica-
tion of his research with then-
girlfriend Prema Mutso (Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw, “Jupiter Ascend-
ing”) limit his character devel-
opment by having race and 
religion being the sole drivers 
of his character. The extent to 
which Omalu is caricatured is 
overbearing, as shown by how 
he goes to extremes to human-
ize the cadavers with which 
he works, at the cost of follow-
ing Western norms that mini-
mize waste. His straightlaced 
nature and childlike inability 
to believe how malicious his 
fellow scientists are in trying to 
silence his findings rightfully 
gets him called a “self-righteous 
bastard” by supporter and col-
league Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec 
Baldwin, “Mission: Impossible 
- Rogue Nation”). His constant 
references to the divine and the 
benefits of seizing opportunity 
make his character more of a 
Christ-like symbol than a real 
doctor.

Omalu’s wife brings an unim-

portant love story into the mix 
even though she adds undue 
stress to the protagonist as he 
deals with federal law enforce-
ment. Her miscarriage in the 
midst of the backlash causes 
Omalu to blame himself for 
taking personal time to recover 
after dealing with the FBI, after 
having explicitly stated he does 
not drink or socialize often. 
This conflicts with her sole rel-
evance to the film – inspiring 
Omalu to enjoy himself more. 
As her profession as a regis-
tered nurse is highlighted at 
the beginning of “Concussion”, 
it was a let-down that Mutso 
was featured so prominently 
even though she did not play a 
role in her husband’s work.

In contrast, the depictions of 

the football players suffering 
from the previously unknown 
chronic 
traumatic 
encepha-

lopathy while the NFL failed 
to stand up for its players by 
resisting to acknowledge Oma-
lu’s findings was effectively 
distressing. This dynamic was 
brilliantly illustrated by Dave 
Duerson, 
a 
former-player-

turned-NFL-Players-Asso-
ciation-executive 
(Adewale 

Akinnuoye-Agbaje, “Trumbo”) 
ignoring the mental health con-
cerns of his past teammate and 
friend Andre Waters (Richard 
T. Jones, “Hot Pursuit”), only 
to commit suicide, when unable 
to cope with the same CTE-
caused neurological deteriora-
tion himself.

As a whole, the film struggles 

to dramatize the state of foot-
ball that led to the finding of 
CTE while telling the behind-
the-scenes story of the man 
who discovered it at the same 
time. Although it has strong 
directing 
and 
commendable 

acting, particularly by Smith, 
the message is poorly relayed 
by focusing on the obstacles 
Omalu faced instead of the 
potential impact his research 
has. In spite of this, it will 
hopefully generate construc-
tive dialogue on this hot-button 
issue.

Troxler posters 
presented by ‘U’

Famed Swiss 

graphic designer to 
have exhibition at 
Slusser Gallery

By NATALIE ZAK

Daily Community Culture Editor

Hung up in my room is a 

wrinkled, slightly torn poster, 
proclaiming in Greek the tour 
dates of a band 
I’ve 
never 

heard 
of 
or 

bothered 
to 

listen 
to. 
It 

exists 
simply 

because 
I 
entered 

Athens 
with 

the intent of 
finding myself 
a souvenir that 
actually 
held 

value, instead 
of buying one 
that would fade 
into 
oblivion. 

This particular 
poster 
was 

valueless, 
but 
it 
met 
the 

grandiose qualifications I had 
set for my steal: brightly colored 
with cool shapes.

What I failed to realize at the 

time of my adolescent thievery 
was that these qualifications I 
had been searching the walls of 
the city for are the foundation 
for graphic design. An art 
typically associated with the 
new technological era, graphic 

design as an art form has been 
on the rise for generations often 
appearing in the form of posters, 
album art and typography.

It was this art that Swiss 

graphic 
designer 
Niklaus 

Troxler found so enchanting as 
a young boy. An exhibit curated 
by Stamps Art & Design prof. 
Franc Nunoo-Quarcoo opens 
this week bringing together 40 
years worth of Troxler’s jazz 
posters, that have gained world 
renown for the standard they 
set for graphic design.

Born 
in 
1947, 
Troxler 

was attracted to the posters 
that surrounded him in his 
hometown 
and 
it 
became 

obvious to him that this was 
what he wanted to help create. 
After studying at the Lucerne 
School of Art and Design, Troxler 
made his way to Paris where he 
began making a name for himself 
in the design world.

“It was clear, that I wanted 

to be a graphic designer … in 
those days, Swiss designers and 
especially 
typographers 
were 

very welcome in Paris,” Troxler 
said in an interview with the 
Daily. “I worked in a team with 
three female designers and we 
did projects for editors, architects 
and also interior designs.”

Every art needs inspiration, 

however, and for Troxler that 
inspiration 
is 
contained 
in 

jazz music. At the age of 19 he 
organized his first jazz concert, 
and 10 years later organized 
the first Willisau Jazz Festival 
in 1975. Passionate about Free 
Jazz, an experimental jazz 
movement that introduced the 
musical stylings of Cecil Taylor 
and John Coltrane to the world, 
Troxler 
recruited 
countless 

musicians 
including 
Archie 

Shepp, Albert Mangelsdorff, 
John Surman and Frank Wright 
to perform at the premiere 
festival.

It is here that Troxler’s 

work flourished. Integrating 
the sonic beauty of jazz music 
into his art, Troxler created 

posters for these festivals every 
year, posters that have brought 
his skill and talent to the 
forefront of the graphic design 
revolution.

“Everything that attracts me 

in jazz, I can adapt in my design: 
improvisation, 
composition, 

sound, 
personal 
expression, 

interaction, order and chaos,” 
he said.

The sonic intricacies of jazz 

can almost be heard in Troxler’s 
designs. His posters contain 
more than bright colors and 
cool shapes; they encompass 
passion, 
joy, 
urgency 
and 

power. It is because of this that 
his pieces have won esteemed 
awards and been collected by 
museums around the world, 
including 
New 
York 
City’s 

Museum of Modern Art.

Troxler hasn’t shied away 

from addressing controversial 
matters in his art either. The red 
Swiss flag dominates a recent 
piece of his that addresses 
the population of Switzerland 
directly, as it proclaims that the 
country must leave its borders 
open for refugees.

Countless 
posters 
exist 

around cities that easily blend 
into 
the 
background. 
They 

make up a large part of urban 
scenery, coming close to being 
the nature that metropolitan 
centers often lack. But as 
Troxler has and continues to 
prove, graphic design is the 
source of admirable works of 
art and calls to action that far 
surpass anything bright colors 
and cool shapes can inspire.

Sam Piazza’s long journey

Sophomore D-man 

earns playing 

time after years of 

struggling for it

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

In late 2013, Sam Piazza’s college 

hockey dream was in shambles.

A youth hockey star growing 

up in Darien, Ill., Piazza’s size 
and aggressive play just didn’t 
translate to the higher levels.

For two years, the defenseman 

had been shipped across the 
country in search of a place where 
he could overcome injuries and 
his game could flourish once 
again. Piazza crisscrossed to 
North Dakota, back to Chicago 
and finally off to Texas as he 
bounced around the edges of the 
junior hockey world.

He struggled to make game-

day rosters, rode the bench and 
endured the lonely prospect of 
being hundreds of miles away 
from home without a clear plan.

The thought of being a healthy 

scratch was a new challenge, one 
that led him to almost hang up his 
skates for good.

As a young player, Piazza suited 

up for the powerhouse Mission 
AAA program 
and 
excelled 

alongside 
teammates 
who are now 
littered around 
the NHL and 
college hockey. 
He recorded 22 
points in the 
2008 
season 

and committed 
to play college 
hockey elsewhere at the age of 16.

“I was all about the puck 

growing up,” Piazza said. “Once I 
got to juniors, it was exposed that 

I was bad defensively. I think I’ve 
come a long way.”

The college offers had long 

since disappeared, but Piazza 
finally broke out in the 2014 
season, his final year of eligibility, 
with the Wichita Falls Wildcats. 
In the NAHL Top Prospects 
Tournament, he secured a spot at 
Michigan and another chance to 
chase his dreams.

Those dreams are different 

today than they might have 
been back when Piazza was 
taken 34th overall in the USHL 
entry draft. In his first season 
at Michigan, Piazza slumped 
again, recording only one assist 
in 10 regular-season appearances. 
Pursuing a degree in mechanical 
engineering, 
he 
is 
balancing 

heavy school demands with the 
discipline needed to crack the 
Wolverines’ defensive rotation.

But 
Piazza 
isn’t 
new 
to 

adversity, and he recommitted 
himself in the offseason.

“Unfortunately, 
I’ve 
been 

scratched a lot in the past couple 
years,” Piazza said. “I know how 
to keep my head in it and stay 
ready and keep my body ready.”

Piazza shed 10 pounds in the 

offseason and started grabbing 
coaches’ attention in practice. 
All that effort paid off when he 
filled in for suspended junior 
defenseman Michael Downing 

in the Great 
Lakes 
Invitational.

Piazza 

recorded three 
points in two 
games 
and 

earned a spot 
in the rotation 
against 
Michigan 
State. 
There, 

he picked up 

minutes on the penalty kill, a 
testament to his improvement on 
the defensive end.

“He’s smart with the puck, and 

he’s smart without the puck,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“He’s doing now what I was told 
he would be able to do here. I 
would call him a good teammate. 
The other guys are getting to play 
every night, and he has to do all 
the extra work to stay ready.

“It’s a tough role.”
For Piazza, the recent success 

has certainly been sweet. It’s 
validation that he can play at the 
collegiate level and that all the 
time he poured into the sport 
was worth it. But he didn’t make 
it in spite of the trouble in junior 
hockey — he made it because of 
that adversity.

“(Junior 
hockey) 
really 

impacted me a lot,” Piazza said. 
“That’s where I learned to be 
mentally tough. You can’t really 

complain about other people, 
you’ve just got to worry about 
yourself and do your best.”

Piazza’s broad shoulders filled 

the armchair as he talked about 
his rollercoaster career with a 
calm, casual air. He’s 5-foot-11 — 
small for a defenseman — and it 
shows on the ice.

It’s apparent that he isn’t 

bothered by the trials he has gone 
through to get here. Instead, the 
sophomore gives off the aura of a 
grizzled veteran — aided somewhat 
by the beard he’s sporting.

What’s also clear is that despite 

Piazza’s success, he isn’t satisfied 
yet. The 21-year-old has battled 
across three states in three years 
to get here. He wants a spot in the 
rotation, and he has worked too 
hard to settle now.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Sam Piazza is finally breaking into the lineup for the Michigan hockey team.

“I’ve been 
scratched a 
lot in the past 
couple years.”

Barnes Arico 
lightens mood, 
revives season

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

Heading into last Thursday’s 

game against Iowa, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team had won 
only one of its previous six games. 
Something had gone awry as 
the Wolverines’ confidence was 
drastically shaken.

No 
longer 
was 
Michigan 

averaging 88 points, previously 
good for the third-best scoring 
offense in the country. At the 
beginning of December, the string 
of losses began with a 17-point 
loss to Princeton.

But coach Kim Barnes Arico is 

a veteran of the game, knowing 
when changes need to be made 
and what resources she should 
use to make those changes. In 
the course of one month, Barnes 
Arico helped the Wolverines 
realize that 17 points was an 
obstacle they could overcome 
when they came back from that 
exact number 
in the second 
half 
against 

the Hawkeyes.

“(Iowa) 

actually looked 
how we looked 
in 
the 
two 

prior games,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said 
in 
her 

weekly 
radio 

show. “This is a 
team that has been off to a great 
start, was a ranked team in the 
country and they got super tight 
down the stretch.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 

anything but tight as they made 
a miraculous comeback to earn 
their first conference win this 
season. It was not only a surprise 
that Michigan made its largest 
comeback since 2007, but also 
that the Wolverines made any 
sort of last-ditch effort given 
recent results.

The three games leading up 

to Iowa had been anything but 
pleasant: a one-point loss against 
Eastern Michigan, a two-point 
loss to Purdue and a nine-point 
lead blown to Indiana in the final 
quarter for yet another defeat.

But Michigan regained its 

confidence before its big break 
against Iowa, and it continued 
that success with a win against 
Minnesota four days later, evening 
out its Big Ten record at 2-2.

“We did spend a lot of time 

just trying to rebuild their 
confidence,” Barnes Arico told 
WTKA Radio on Tuesday. “We 
had three devastating losses that 
came down to the last possession 
of the game, and in all three of the 
games, we had the opportunity 
to win the game and kind of 
struggled down the stretch.

“That really affected our young 

kids’ confidence. … Even our older 
kids really didn’t play a ton of 
minutes last year where they were 
in those same positions. It was a 
new experience for all of us.”

So what exactly did Barnes 

Arico need to accomplish in order 

to turn the season around? Did 
the Wolverines need to practice 
their free-throws, considering 
they had missed 32 points from 
the charity stripe through six 
games? Did they need to practice 
rebounding? Maybe Michigan 
needed to work on passing?

According to Barnes Arico, it 

was as simple as taking pressure 
off of her players and lightening 
the mood.

Before Thursday, Michigan’s 

assistant coaches made a highlight 
reel of footage from games such 
as Xavier and UCLA, when the 
Wolverines looked like they were 
truly playing Michigan basketball.

The assistant coaches held an 

activity for the players to paint 
a non-basketball related word 
that was significant in their lives, 
which they later hung above their 
beds. This way, they could be 
reminded of the activity and its 
emphasis on taking a step back 
when the going gets rough.

“The 
kids 

really began to 
get 
confident 

again 
and 

really 
enjoy 

the 
process,” 

Barnes 
Arico 

said. 
“That’s 

something 
that we talk 
a lot about — 
enjoying 
the 

process. 
It’s 

not always just the outcome.”

According to Barnes Arico, 

sharing ideas among the coaching 
staff is a crucial element of success. 
The Michigan staff regularly 
sends e-mails to each other with 
links from social media or around 
the Internet, which sometimes 
include leadership presentations 
or inspirational talks from coaches 
around the country. 

Outside 
the 
basketball 

realm, Barnes Arico has also 
found guidance. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
student 

manager, 
the 
daughter 
of 

Michigan hockey assistant coach 
Brian Wiseman, asked if her 
father could attend a practice 
and see if there were any team-
building activities he would find 
value in. Barnes Arico agreed, 
knowing Wiseman would do the 
same for her if she wanted to visit 
a hockey practice.

This collaboration between 

Michigan coaches is what Barnes 
Arico referred to as an “open-
door policy.” In fact, she has 
gained plenty of insight from 
Michigan men’s basketball coach 
John Beilein through the years.

“In our profession, it’s really 

important that coaches feel like 
they can lean on other coaches,” 
Barnes Arico said. “All of us are 
in the same boat at some point or 
another. … Sometimes as a coach, 
what happens is you get so tight, 
then your players are getting tight 
(and) sometimes you just need to 
go to the movies.”

In one week, Michigan has 

loosened up and put the season 
back on course.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Kim Barnes Arico has her team’s season back on track after three straight losses.

“We did spend 
a lot of time just 
trying to rebuild 
their confidence.”

Season Review: Defensive Backs

Lewis, Peppers 
led deep group 

that could get even 

better in 2016

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2015 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2016. In this edition: 
defensive backs.

When 
Michigan 
emerged 

from its so-called “submarine” 
training camp in August, no 
one was entirely sure what to 
expect out of its secondary. Most 
expected 
redshirt 
freshman 

Jabrill Peppers and Stanford 
transfer Wayne Lyons to be 
welcome additions, but were 
not sure how the returning 
Wolverines would filter out.

Michigan 
was 
heavy 
on 

safeties with Lyons, Peppers, 
senior 
Jarrod 
Wilson 
and 

redshirt junior Jeremy Clark. 
But cornerback was a question 
mark, as Blake Countess had 
transferred to Auburn, which 
meant 
only 
redshirt 
junior 

Jourdan Lewis and error-prone 
junior 
Channing 
Stribling 

were bringing back starting 
experience.

The 
Wolverines 
— 
who 

finished 21st in pass defense 
in 2014 — were expected to be 
strong in the secondary once 
again, but with new faces and 
a new coaching staff, nothing 
was certain.

With the 2015 season in the 

books, it’s safe to say that any 
uncertainty about Michigan’s 
pass defense was squashed early 
and often en route to a truly 
special year.

The 12th-ranked Wolverines 

led the nation in passer rating 
allowed 
(95.0) 
and 
yards 

allowed per attempt (5.4), while 
finishing third in passing yards 
allowed per game (158.8), total 
touchdowns allowed (7) and 
completion percentage (48.0) 

allowed throughout the season.

Individually, Lewis was the 

star of the defensive backfield, 
earning first-team All-Big Ten 
and All-American honors, and 
forced three turnovers while 
setting a school record with 21 
pass breakups. Peppers was not 
too far behind, totaling 10 pass 
breakups, All-American honors 
and the Big Ten Freshman of the 
Year award.

Beyond 

Peppers 
and 

Lewis, 
Clark 

made 
the 

journey 
to 

cornerback, 
Stribling tied 
or set career 
highs in every 
category, 
and 
Wilson 

— along with 
junior safeties 
Dymonte Thomas and Delano 
Hill — was so consistent that 
Lyons barely saw the field.

High Point: It’s hard to 

imagine a secondary at any level 
having a better five-game stretch 
than Michigan did from Week 
2 to Week 6. Against Oregon 

State, UNLV, then-No. 22 BYU, 
then-No. 13 Northwestern and 
Maryland, 
the 
Wolverines 

allowed just 60 completions 
on 143 attempts, 483 yards and 
eight interceptions, compared to 
just two touchdowns.

To put that into a per-

game perspective, an average 
quarterback 
performance 

against Michigan in that stretch 
was 12-of-27 passing for 97 

yards, 
1-2 

interceptions 
and 
no 

guarantee 
of 

a touchdown. 
Perhaps 
just 

as 
notable 

is 
that 
only 

BYU 
made 

it through a 
game without 
resorting 
to 
a 
backup 

quarterback.

Low 
Point: 
Allowing 
a 

touchdown 
in 
consecutive 

weeks usually is not a low 
point for a team’s secondary, 
but Michigan’s slip-ups from 
defensive backs were few and 
far between. The only time a 

quarterback seemed in control 
over the Wolverines occurred 
when Michigan State’s Connor 
Cook and Minnesota’s Mitch 
Leidner combined to throw for 
645 yards, including several big 
plays and two touchdowns in 
back-to-back weeks.

Teams also began to find 

success on the ground against 
Michigan late in the season, but 
it’s hard to pin that on a secondary 
that took passing almost out of 
the equation for most offenses.

The Future: The future looks 

bright — maybe even brighter — 
for Michigan’s secondary next 
fall. Lewis, Peppers, Stribling, 
Thomas and Hill will all return 
next season, and Clark could as 
well if he chooses. Assuming 
Clark stays, Wilson is the only 
departing starter, and Thomas 
and Hill looked ready to fill his 
void late in the season.

With no high-profile commits 

at safety or cornerback in the 
2016 recruiting class yet, it 
appears that freshman Keith 
Washington 
and 
sophomore 

Brandon Watson could be the 
lone new contributors in the 
stacked position group next fall.

Junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis and the Michigan secondary capped a standout season with a Citrus Bowl victory.

The future looks 
bright — maybe 
even brighter — 

for next fall.

MICHIGAN 70, MARYLAND 67

LIVE BY THE THREE

Irvin returns to his 
former self with 22 
points in Michigan’s 

marquee victory

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

In late December, Michigan 

men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein 
acknowledged 
what 

seemed like an inevitable truth: 
Zak Irvin might not return to 
100 percent, in terms of health or 
rhythm, at any point during the 
2015-16 season.

Tuesday, the junior forward 

made a simple assertion.

“I feel healthy,” Irvin said. “My 

body is 100 percent.”

At that point, Irvin barely had 

to say it. He had just scored 22 
points during Michigan’s 70-67 
stunner over No. 3 Maryland, 
playing with the confidence he 
had seemed to lack in the 15 games 
leading up to the breakthrough as 
he recovered from an offseason 
back surgery.

“We couldn’t guard him,” said 

Maryland coach Mark Turgeon.

Irvin’s confidence, and his 

irrepressible shot, were never 
more evident than with just 
under three minutes remaining in 
the game, as junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. clung to a defensive 
rebound as tightly as Michigan 
clung to its five-point lead. Beilein 
signaled to his point guard to 
play slowly and burn clock as he 
brought the Wolverines into their 
half-court set.

Irvin wasn’t having any of it. He 

received the ball from Walton at 
the top of the key, and knowing it 
was his night, he rose, off balance, 
and brought the house down with 
his third trey of the night.

Asked if he would have made, 

or even attempted, the same shot 
just two weeks ago, Irvin could 
only smile.

“I’m getting more confident 

each game,” he said. “I think I 
would have taken that shot, but I 
was definitely in a rhythm tonight, 
which made that shot easier.”

It was the proverbial dagger 

— the shot that gave Michigan 
its first win in five tries against 
ranked opponents this season. 
And while in a Beilein-designed 
utopia it might have come with 10 
fewer seconds on the shot clock, 
Irvin recognized the opportunity 
when he saw it.

“I think everybody knows, 

once I see one go in, I feel like 
every one can go in,” Irvin said. 
“We have different options in that 
set, but I felt like I had enough 
room to be able to make the shot, 
and I did. It just felt good when it 
left my hand.”

For two months, Irvin had 

looked like a shell of his former 
self. After working for two years 
to do away with a longstanding 
label — “just a shooter” — the 
junior forward struggled in the 
early season to prove himself 
as 
even 
that. 
His 
3-point 

percentages dipped into the low 
20s, and his attempts from long 
range were often discernibly off 
target almost from the moment 
they left his hand.

The return to grace hasn’t been 

smooth — just as Irvin seemed 
to regain some semblance of 

a rhythm, senior guard Caris 
LeVert fell out of commission 
with a left leg injury. So the 
Wolverines 
have 
turned 
to 

Irvin, among others, to shoulder 
the scoring load, especially in 
Thursday’s 87-70 loss at Purdue. 
With redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson locked down 
by the Boilermakers’ Raphael 
Davis, the ball wound up in 
Irvin’s hands frequently.

It was to no avail. With the 

burden of LeVert’s scoring on 
his shoulders, Irvin shot just 
2-for-10 from the field, and he 
said Tuesday that the pressure 
of playing in his home state took 
him out of the mindset he needed 
to be successful.

Against Maryland, it was a 

different story.

“He’s doing some things,” 

Beilein said. “He’s driving the ball 
to the basket. He’s driving it under 
control. That was a good night 
for him — a really good night for 
him — and if we can just get him 
(to play) with the consistency that 
he expects of himself, that will 
really help us.”

Michigan’s assistant coaches, 

as Beilein mentioned offhandedly 
after Tuesday’s game, call Irvin 
“big shot,” in reference to his 
reputation in high school and 
across youth leagues in his 
teenage years.

They might want to update the 

rationale behind the nickname, as 
Tuesday made it clear that Irvin 
still has his ability as a playmaker. 
Calling Irvin a big shot, at times 
like these, is only fair. Sometimes, 
and perhaps more often going 
forward, he acts like a big shot, and 
sometimes, he makes big shots.

the Wolverines a 59-57 lead, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan 
Robinson 
sank 
a 

difficult underhanded reverse 
layup and junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. buried a 3-pointer to 
extend the lead.

Maryland (4-1, 15-2) rallied 

furiously in the closing minutes, 
with guard Rasheed Sulaimon 
sinking 
two 
3-pointers 
in 

the final three minutes and 
Stone knocking down two free 
throws to cut the lead to two. 
But Donnal grabbed a crucial 
offensive rebound and made 
one of two shots at the foul line 
on Michigan’s next possession, 
which was followed up by a 
missed triple from Sulaimon just 
before the buzzer to give the 
Wolverines the upset win.

Irvin 
— 
who 
Maryland 

coach Mark Turgeon said was 
“unguardable” tonight — finished 
the game with 22 points, Robinson 
added 17 and Michigan hit 12 
3-pointers, the most the Terrapins 
have allowed in a game all season.

In Beilein’s mind, the victory 

was a glimpse of the full potential 
of Irvin and Walton — two 
players who have been forced into 
important roles since they were 
sophomores, and two players 
who were tasked with closing out 
the game as the most experienced 

leaders on the court.

“This is that next step for 

them,” Beilein said. “It’s the 
feeling right now that (they can 
be like) Tim Hardaway, Trey 
Burke, Nik Stauskas or Caris 
LeVert — make a big play to win 
the game.”

Even without LeVert — the 

Wolverines’ 
leading 
scorer, 

rebounder and assist man — 
Michigan 
initially 
had 
little 

trouble getting off to a quick 
start, thanks in no small part to 
the 3-pointer.

After 

Maryland 
bullied 
its 

way to four 
points 
off 

two offensive 
rebounds 
to 

start the game, 
the Wolverines 
turned to the 
outside, where 
Walton, Irvin and Robinson 
buried three straight triples to 
give Michigan an 11-6 lead and 
get the Crisler Center crowd 
involved early.

Maryland 
was 
without 

Trimble for much of the first 
half, as he exited the game with 
two fouls with 9:40 remaining. 
He finished the game with just 
two points.

The first half ended in a 3-point 

battle, with Maryland forward 
Robert 
Carter 
Jr. 
knocking 

down a shot-clock-beating triple 
to give Maryland a 22-21 lead 

and Layman hitting a trey of his 
own a few moments later. But 
Robinson answered every blow, 
hitting three 3-pointers in less 
than three minutes to retake a 
five-point lead.

The Wolverines still couldn’t 

match the Terrapins’ size early on 
— they were outrebounded 16-12 
in the opening frame and 36-27 
in total — but they stepped up the 
effort and physicality. Before he 
closed the game with the offensive 
rebound, Donnal ended the first 

half 
on 
an 

outstanding 
stretch 
in 

which 
he 

blocked 
Sulaimon 
and Carter on 
back-to-back 
possessions 
and 
tipped 

in 
a 
missed 

3-pointer at the 

buzzer to give Michigan a 37-29 
lead at the half.

The Wolverines nearly gave 

that lead away in the second 
frame, but after a few more 
timely threes and free throws, 
they secured their biggest win of 
the season.

“This is the Big Ten. It’s 

gonna be a dogfight each game,” 
Irvin said. “I think teams are 
overlooking us with (senior guard 
Spike Albrecht) and Caris out, 
and we’ve just got to let everyone 
know we are a good ballclub 
without them.”

FLINT WATER CRISIS
ON THE

“This is not my legacy. This is part of my legacy because 
I’m responsible for the entire state and our operations. 

But there are many other good things going on and we’re 

working hard to recover.” 

— Michigan Gov. RICK SNYDER (R) on the impact of the Flint 

Water Crisis on his legacy as governor

***

“If you were to put something in a population to keep 
them down for generation and generations to come, it 

would be lead ... It drops your IQ, it affects your behavior, 

it’s been linked to criminality, it has multigenerational 

impacts. There is no safe level of lead in a child.”

Zooming In: Not faring well

F

or as long as I can remember, 
I’ve been afraid of endings. I 
don’t mean to say the past 19 

years have been plagued with a looming 
fear of death or apocalyptic destruction. 
I’m talking about an inner reluctance 
to move on from, let go of and say good-
bye to the people, places and events that 
have shaped my life.

Common emotional challenges for me 

include — but are by no means limited to 
— birthdays, new years and major mile-
stones.

I can still remember tearing up on my 

13th birthday. When my parents asked 
me what was wrong, I told them I was 
sad I would no longer be a kid. “Yeah, 
it’s all downhill from here,” my Dad 
said, trying to make me laugh the way he 
always does.

But that wasn’t quite it. I wasn’t afraid 

of facing the future, becoming an adult 
or accepting new responsibilities. Nor 
was I in mourning of the frizzy, awk-
ward rollercoaster that was my pre-
teenage existence.

I just wasn’t ready to let go of 12-years-

old. I guess most would classify my con-
dition as a fear of change. But to me it 
seems much more complex.

I felt a similar sadness while taking 

one last look at my classmates before 
leaving my senior celebration on the 
night of graduation. I should clarify that 
my high school career was nothing more 
than typical. To give you the Reader’s 
Digest version of those four years: I sur-
vived.

By the time I’d committed to Michi-

gan, I was very ready for new people, 
buildings and experiences. Yet no mat-
ter how excited I was to move on, I could 
not escape the inevitable churning in my 
stomach that came during graduation.

It’s hard to explain what I was feeling 

because I knew I would stay close to the 
people I truly cared long after gradu-
ation. But what about everyone — and 
everything — else?

There wasn’t a chance I would miss 

the rigid bell schedule, mandatory math 
classes and stereotypically segregated 
cliques I’d endured in high school. Yet, 
I still couldn’t help but feel sad that I 
would never be in the same place with 
the same people doing the same things 
again. That’s what bothers me the most 
about endings. 

There remains something very sad to 

me about coming to the realization that, 
in that moment, I was taking my last 
look at the group of people who — for 
better or worse — collectively shaped 
my high school experience and there-
fore the person I am today.

It’s obviously much easier to pin-

point the reason behind my sadness as 
I watched my brother pack the car in 
preparation for his freshman year of 
college. I would miss him completely, 
and living at home never felt quite right 
after he left.

But I’ve come to realize that it’s not 

impossible to miss things I never nec-
essarily valued. I guess all emotions 
attached to different people and places 
— whether good or bad — are what make 
them real and therefore hard to let go of.

THE statement

A

fter the semester finishes and I’m home — sleep-deprived, brain 
fizzled out — I usually binge-watch a show on Netflix. This time 
around, I binge-watched a girl’s YouTube channel.

She’s 23 years old and pretty. She films her videos in her Manhattan apart-

ment replete with Christmas lights and exposed brick. Her videos cover 
everything from contouring tutorials and New Year’s Eve lookbooks to sto-
ries on how to feel beautiful and anxiety attacks. 

It’s a little like escapist television, but it’s also a looking glass in a life I could 

— and want to — have. When I’m her age, I could be living in New York in a 
stylish apartment, with a stylish boyfriend and an Instagram account that 
gets more than 20 likes on a photo. Most of all, I admire that she’s confident 
enough to make a YouTube account starring herself and her life; I can’t bring 
myself to post a selfie on social media for fear of being seen as egotistical.

What’s weird is that I know I would hate her if I knew her in real life. I’ve 

hated random girls for as long as I can remember. While quite a few of them 
were truly irritating people, many of these girls had something I was jealous 
of that also, for some reason, made me dislike them — a past with my boy-
friend, “stealing” my friend or some other thing that made me panicked.

The ex of a current hook up is the easiest target. Stalking the social media 

accounts of the “annoying little bitch who isn’t even that pretty” is a guilty 
pleasure of mine and my friends’. We have an excellent ability to find despi-
cable things about the people we hate.

If my husband’s ex-girlfriend was Mother Teresa, I could reframe her as 

the devil in my mind. Why was she so giving? Like, we get it, you like all the 
attention, can you just calm down?

I’ve found that the girls I admire and the girls I hate have a lot in common: 

they are well dressed, beautiful, smart and confident. It seems like the cooler 
they are, the more we hate them.

But, surprise surprise, this is not very healthy!
It’s a loss to hate on a girl that could be our friend just because of some weird 

insecurity. The more I cut other girls down, the easier it is to cut myself down.

We’re scared above all that someone — a friend or a love interest — will see 

that there’s someone better out there and leave us. We’re scared that the per-
son who used to make us so happy found someone who makes them happier 
than we did.

But self worth doesn’t work like that. The fact that our friend found a new 

friend, that our boyfriend touched some other girl sometime during his 
20-something years of existence doesn’t mean we suck. So there’s no need to 
stalk this girl’s Instagram from freshman year and screenshot and send the 
stupidest captions to three different group texts.

I can’t really picture my weird YouTube girl crush doing that — and I think 

we would all rather be friends with someone who spends her free time giving 
life tips to thousands of people online rather than digging through Facebook 
circa 2012.

ILLUSTRATIONS BY EMILIE FARRUGIA

Amid election year nonsense and a perilous international 

environment, Barack Obama outlined several policy 

goals for the upcoming year in his last State of the Union 

Address Tuesday. We’ve outlined a few notable ones.

THE LIST

NO-COST COMMUNITY COLLEGE
“Providing two years of community college at no cost for every 
responsible student is one of the best ways to do that.”

JOB TRAINING FOR THE UNEMPLOYED 
“Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn’t just 
make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make 
sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s 
ready to hire him.”

MORE FUNDING FOR CANCER RESEARCH
“For the loved ones we’ve lost, for the family we can still save, let’s 
make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.”

FORCE TO FIGHT ISIS
“If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to 
send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally 
authorize the use of military force against ISIL.”

TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP
“With TPP, China doesn’t set the rules in that region, we do. 
You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this 
agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.”

END THE CUBAN EMBARGO
“We restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel 
and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of 
the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and 
credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is 
over. Lift the embargo.”

Daily Staff Reporter

Editor’s note: The names of individuals performing the HIV 

testing described in this story have been changed to protect their 
identities because the reporter did not identify themselves as 
such, denoted by an asterisk.

Spectrum Center, Michigan Union

I walk into the Spectrum Center and immediately grab 

a fun-sized bag of Skittles from a box on the floor. I rip 
them open carelessly, stick five in my mouth and chew them 
aggressively. Spotting me, a man in his mid-twenties, Alex*, 
asks me, cheerfully, if I’m here for HIV testing.

“Yes,” I say.
It’s the only word I’ll speak for 20 minutes.
I don’t tell him that I’m a reporter because I want to 

experience the process as any patient would, a practice I would 
repeat for every subsequent testing.

The Spectrum Center is the short name for the University’s 

Office of LGBT Affairs. Its mission, it seems, is to end 
stigmatization around non-heterosexuality on campus. It 
offers a space where students can go to learn more about 
different gender identities and hopes to create a campus that 
is discrimination-free.

I suppose it makes sense, then, that Spectrum, a place 

that welcomes non-heterosexuality, is also a site for human 
immunodeficiency virus testing. In the United States, HIV is 
still seen by many as a disease that afflicts mostly homosexual 
males. This is not totally unfair — of the 29, 800 new HIV cases 
in the U.S. in 2010, roughly 78 percent were MSM, or men who 
have sex with men.

At Spectrum, the HIV/AIDS Resource Center, or HARC, 

hosts HIV testing once a week, on Mondays from 6 to 8 p.m.

On a table above the box of Skittles sits a cup filled with 

condoms, paired with a helpful flyer that promises to teach 
me “How To Use a Condom.” The entryway has a rainbow-
colored mat. Ah, that’s why they chose Skittles. Taste the 
Rainbow.

In some ways, the room is full — it is filled with books 

written about or by members of the LGBT community, flyers 
and boxes of grab-able items.

What the room lacks, however, are other humans. I am the 

only person here for testing.

I eat another pack of Skittles, then Alex hands me a 

questionnaire. I begin answering questions that attempt to 
outline my sex habits and drug and alcohol use.

Have you ever had sex without a condom?

Have you ever had sex while intoxicated?
I finish the questionnaire and hand it to Alex, who tells me 

to wait.

…

Last year, HIV cases reached a 15-year high in Washtenaw 

County. In a press release, Cathy Wilcznyksi, adult health 
program supervisor for Washtenaw County Public Health, 
urged everyone to get tested — and to use condoms.

“Testing is important,” Wilczynski wrote. “Know your 

status. If you have sex, use a condom. It’s that simple.”

HIV is transmitted primarily through sex, specifically 

unprotected sex. I know from friends and classmates that a 
lot of people on the University’s campus have unprotected sex. 
Statistics also back this up: A 2011 survey by Bayer Healthcare 
showed that 53 percent of people between ages 15 and 24 have 
had unprotected sex with a new partner at least once.

With this tendency toward risk in mind, it seems important 

that we, as young people, feel comfortable with the idea of 
getting tested for HIV.

Testing options are limited for University students, available 

at only two places on campus. There’s Spectrum, then there’s 
the Wolverine Wellness department at University Health 
Services.

There used to be a third place right near campus where 

students could get tested — the Safe Sex Store. The store closed 
last October due to lack of sales. Located on South University 
Avenue, it sold condoms and other sex paraphernalia. The 
owner, Beth Karmeisool, offered free HIV testing every 
Thursday.

Karmeisool still has an online store that offers a lot of the 

same products that the physical location used to sell. Even so, 
she no longer offers the free services that were available at S3, 
including HIV testing, pregnancy testing and sexual health 
counseling.

Karmeisool had a specific complaint about testing sites like 

UHS and Spectrum: lack of a friendly environment. She said 
she believes S3 was more accessible to students due to the retail 
environment of her store. The products for sale offered an easy 
excuse for students who might be embarrassed to get tested 
for fear of running into someone they knew — students getting 
tested could say they were buying condoms, etc. if they ran into 
friends.

“I do think that some students found it easier to come in to 

S3,” she said. “It’s a little bit nerve wracking to go to UHS or the 
Spectrum Center or any other community health center.”

In my experience Karmeisool was right: S3 was definitely 

not intimidating. The store was reminiscent of a candy shop, 

except its buckets held condoms and other sex toys instead 
of Sour Patch Kids and gummy worms. Always present was a 
golden retriever, Jake — a trained therapy dog who the store’s 
visitors could play with.

At full capacity, Karmeisool would test about five people a 

week for HIV, sometimes more. Without her store, she said the 
Ann Arbor community is missing an important resource.

“There’s now a void there, and that does make me sad,” she 

said.

Wolverine Wellness, UHS

It’s freezing cold and raining, so I throw on a black trench 

coat, pairing it with leggings and a charcoal sweater. I look like 
I’m in mourning.

I have an appointment for HIV testing at Wolverine 

Wellness, which is on the second floor of UHS. Wolverine 
Wellness’ mission is to “promote wellness” for students, and 
help them make “informed decisions.” In practice, this seems 
to mean helping curb excessive alcohol and marijuana use, in 
addition to offering services like HIV testing.

When I called, the receptionist told me I was not to put 

anything in my mouth — including food, drink and gum — for 
30 minutes before the test.

I walk in chewing a piece of fluorescent green gum, which I 

meant to spit out earlier but didn’t. 

When I check in, I am handed a clipboard and told to sit on a 

couch in a small waiting room. There is a sound soother blaring 
white noise to my right, as if I’m about to get a massage. Still 
chewing my gum, I begin to fill out a questionnaire similar to 
the one I was given at Spectrum.

I am once again the only person getting tested. I think of 

the image Karmeisool described of packed testing dates at S3, 
picturing some sort of rambunctious get-together, and feel 
strangely lonely.

…

Leon Golson is the director of Prevention Programs at HARC 

— the nonprofit that hosts the testing at Spectrum. HARC does 
a lot of outreach for HIV and AIDS around Washtenaw County.

Golson said that a failure to test exists not just on the 

University’s campus, but also throughout Washtenaw County. 
Spectrum’s testing site is a satellite location of HARC.

HARC tested only six people positive for HIV in 2014. Golson 

said the number is representative not of the actual people who 
contracted HIV in Washtenaw County last year, but of the 
failure of at-risk individuals to get tested.

“It continues to be a challenge, particularly in the Ypsilanti/

Ann Arbor area, to really get those individuals who are at risk 
to come in and get tested,” Golson said. “We try and make 

An exploration into HIV testing at the University

Getting Tested: 

ourselves available as much as we possibly can 
to our targeted populations.”

Golson did not agree with Karmeisool that 

people in Washtenaw County fail to get tested 
because they do not feel there is a friendly 
environment available. Instead, he said people 
are scared of dealing with the consequences 
that would come with testing positive.

“Having to commit to taking a pill every 

day,” Golson said. “Then there’s the issue 
around disclosing your status. So that can 
really make it hard for folks to feel comfortable 
about going through an HIV test.”

Though there is still a stigma around being 

HIV-positive, the open discrimination against 
the afflicted seen in the early days of the virus 
no longer seems to be a serious issue. Golson 
has been living with HIV for 30 years. He said 
he has never faced any obvious discrimination 
due to his HIV status.

“I probably wouldn’t even recognize it if it 

was happening,” he said. “From my experience, 
my perception has all been very positive with 
regards to my HIV status.”

In administering tests, Golson has had to 

deliver a positive test result. He said HARC 
tries to make patients in this situation feel as 
though the power is in their hands.

“If I’m giving positive results, I will share 

my status, let them know how I’ve been living 
with it,” Golson said. “We usually try to leave 
them with a sense of hope, and some concrete 
next steps that they can act on.”

Spectrum

I eat a third pack of Skittles before Alex 

tells me to come with him. We go into a small, 
fluorescently lit room where extra cardboard 
boxes of Skittles are stored. This is good news, 
as there will probably be none left in the main 
room by the time I leave.

Along a circular table, a napkin is laid out 

with a tab of paper that looks like the pH paper 
I’ve used in countless chemistry labs and a 
small, box-like object that resembles a pencil 
sharpener.

Alex tells me about the test: The pencil 

sharpener is actually a needle that will prick 
my finger. The paper tracks antibodies — 
basically, it’s tracking whether or not your 
immune system is responding to the HIV 
virus. If a dark line appears that means I have 
the antibody, which means I have HIV. The 
test will take 20 minutes.

“How are you doing?” Alex asks, probably 

concerned about my seeming inability to 
speak.

“I’m fine,” I say, listlessly. The first time I’ve 

spoken since, “Yes.” 

At this, Alex takes the pencil sharpener 

and presses it down on my fingertip, causing a 
needle to prick me, hard. It feels like my finger 
has just been stapled. Blood gushes out.

Alex realizes he didn’t take out a pipette — 

which he needs to suck blood from my finger 
and put it on the testing paper. My finger 
bleeds all over the napkin while Alex takes way 
too long to remove a pipette from the box.

Once he finally gets my blood onto the paper, 

he covers the strip up so I won’t stare at it, and 
starts a 20-minute timer. Then he talks to me. I 
stare down at my blood, which is spattered all 
over the table.

Alex does not seem to think I have HIV. 

He does not ask me what I will do if I have it. 
Instead, he wants me to make a plan for what I 
will do in the future to keep myself HIV-free.

With 12 minutes gone, Alex decides to 

uncover the strip. The test for the antibody is 
negative: I do not have HIV. Alex says he has 
never had a positive.

…

LSA 
sophomore 
Isaiah 
Zeavin-Moss, 

a student in my AIDS class, also went to 
Spectrum for HIV testing. Like me, Isaiah was 
not actually concerned about having HIV. 

“In general, it was a pretty disenchanting, 

disappointing experience,” Isaiah said.

I met Isaiah at the Starbucks on South 

University Avenue, right across from where 
the Safe Sex Store used to be. I sat down next 
to him at a two-person table.

I’m not sure whether or not Alex tested 

Isaiah, but Alex did say he had tested other 
people from my class, and I’m going to assume 
he did.

When checking Isaiah’s result, Alex found 

he had administered the test wrong. He said 
this was the second time he had done this in 
two weeks.

Isaiah said he could not imagine how 

terribly someone would feel if they were truly 
worried they had HIV and their test was 
botched.

“If I had felt that I was in legitimate danger 

of having HIV, if I came in there with a real 
fear of that … I would only be made to feel way 
more fearful,” he said.

Isaiah did say that Alex was a really 

cool person. They had a long talk about 
communication in relationships, discussing 
the reasons for the popularity of the Tinder 
app. 

“We came up with the idea that Tinder is 

so popular because communication is almost 
discouraged,” Isaiah said. “Anything beyond 
the encounter itself isn’t part of the equation 
anymore. It was super interesting.”

Unlike me, Alex did ask Isaiah what he 

would do if he had HIV. They talked about 
who he would turn to for support if his test 
was positive. 

I don’t know why Alex didn’t ask me the 

same question. Maybe he didn’t take me 
seriously, or maybe I just wasn’t giving him 
much to work with. 

UHS

After a couple of minutes, a woman comes 

quietly out of a door directly to my right. I 
don’t notice her come in, and I jump visibly as 
she says hello to me in a quiet purr. This tester, 
Laurel*, is much older than Alex, and reminds 
me of a mother, though not mine.

I realize I still haven’t spit out my illicit 

gum, and try and surreptitiously throw it in 
Laurel’s trash. I am totally obvious about 
it, but she doesn’t notice. When she asks 
me, “So you haven’t put anything in your 
mouth, right?” I almost crack a smile. I 
tell her no, I haven’t.

Unlike the test at Spectrum, this will 

one will be oral. I sigh with relief: no 
finger prick.

Laurel shows me a small tube of what 

she calls “developer fluid.” She then 
gives me directions on how to swab 
my mouth. I tune out immediately, like 

when my tennis coach explains a complicated 
volley drill and I’m left scrambling to follow 
the other players.

Laurel hands me a little stick that looks 

like an extra thick Q-tip and looks at me 
expectantly. When I blurt out that I don’t 
know what to do, she smiles kindly.

“I’ll guide you,” she tells me. 
On her command, I move the swab all along 

my inside top lip, then my bottom lip, then 
stick it into the open tube of developer fluid. 
Like the prick test, my results will take 20 
minutes.

On the swab stick, there are two lines: a 

C-line and a T-line. Also similar to the prick 
test, the swab is looking for HIV antibodies, or 
response proteins in my body. If only a C-line 
appears, the test is negative. If a C- and a T-line 
appear, the test is positive.

Though Laurel is much more 

soothing than Alex was, she does 
not 
invite 
my 
confidence. 

Throughout the 20 minutes, 
she 
drills 
me 
with 

personal questions about 
my sex life, protection 
use and alcohol use 
that I do not want to 
answer. Whenever 
I 
do 

answer, she jumps on the opportunity to pick 
my words apart for additional meaning.

Like Alex, Laurel fails to address the 

question of what I will do if I’m positive.

When time is up, Laurel shows me the test, 

which is, expectedly, negative. 

On my wet walk back to my apartment, 

I once again pass the old location of the Safe 
Sex Store. I think about how HIV is real. How 
people do get it, even in college, even in places 
like Ann Arbor. And students who are sexually 
active, or just interested, should have places 
to go on campus where they feel comfortable 
talking about it. 

Maybe that’s what the Safe Sex Store was. 

And if that’s true, then this campus needs 
another place like it. Hopefully, that place will 
come soon.

Personal Statement: On a Couch in Detroit

by Adam DePollo, Daily Arts Writer

A 

few weeks ago I was at a show in Detroit, sitting next 
to my friend David on a white leather couch in the de 
facto VIP section of a club/art gallery in Midtown. We 

were surrounded by about 30 artfully dressed rappers, paint-
ers, producers and filmmakers who were all passing around 
blunts and talking about their work. Someone was actively 
selling weed and possibly cocaine on the other couch about 
three feet away from us. There was 
a girl twerking in the corner while 
she waited in line for the bathroom. 
Everything in the room was illumi-
nated by a set of blue neon lights, and 
it felt like we were in either an arcade 
or the movie “Spring Breakers” — but 
the drug deal going on right next to us 
made it feel a lot more like the latter.

The image of James Franco fellat-

ing a pistol popped into my head, and 
I started laughing. Then I looked over 
at David, who I’ve known since my 
sophomore year at Detroit Country 
Day School — a very expensive pri-
vate school in Beverly Hills, Michigan 
that we both attended on scholarship. 
I thought about how we used to play 
“Super Smash Bros.” and talk about 
“Top Gear” in our homeroom dur-
ing lunch hour, between meetings 
with college prep advisors. I let loose 
a stupefied “bruh.” We both looked 
over at the drug deal for a moment, 
and then I asked the question that’s 
almost always gnawing at the back of 
my head when I find myself in a room 
full of musicians in Detroit: “What 
the fuck are we doing here?”

David, I found out, was asking 

himself the same question for many of 
the same reasons. When you’re grow-
ing up in a middle-class household in 
Southeast Michigan like we both did, 
you’re given a sort of default narrative 
arc for your life that, frankly, doesn’t 
include an episode with you sitting 
on a couch in Detroit across from 
a rapper named Ka$h ThA KuSh-
MaN. It goes more like: work hard 
in high school, do your extracurricu-
lars, get into a good college, figure 
out what you’re doing with your life, 
get a respectable job making more than your parents, marry, 
kids, retire, rinse and repeat for the next 15 generations. If you 
play the game right, you end up in a nice city like New York 
or Chicago with a comfortable apartment, good clothes and a 
well-fed 401k. If you had interrupted us mid-“Smash” back in 
high school and asked where we thought we’d be in six years, 
our answers probably would have been “Episode 3: Foot in the 
Door at Business Corp.”

But there we are, and there’s Ka$h. He’s not evaporating 

— in fact, he’s talking about the time he took 25 tabs of acid 
at once — which means one of two things: Either we really 
fucked up, or we found a way out of the Matrix.

On the one hand, like, shit, we’re on the damn VIP couch! 

I’m a journalist — I interviewed the guy that just said he took 
25 tabs of acid at once. David is a DJ — he has done shows on 
the same stage as the guy that just said he took 25 tabs of acid 

at once. There’s a concert going on in the next room over, and 
we both know the guy who’s performing — personally! This is 
the most well-dressed roomful of people I have ever seen and, 
for all I know, anybody in this room could conceivably become 
a world-famous artist one day. We’re also in this room. We’re 
cool goddammit!

On the other hand, what the fuck are we doing here?!? We 

should have jobs with benefits! We should have places to be at 
8 a.m. tomorrow! That guy just said he took 25 tabs of acid at 
once, is he insane?!? There’s a drug deal going on in this room, 
shouldn’t I be calling the cops?!? Weed is legal here?!? Don’t 
they know weed is a gateway drug? Does anyone in this build-
ing know CPR?

We sat there on the couch for a while longer, going back and 

forth about how absurd and incredible and confusing and just 
plain lucky it was for us to be where we were — this VIP couch 
that our parents probably never would have had the chance to 
sit on when they were our age, a couch that wasn’t even in this 
room until someone decided it was a good idea to open a club 
and art gallery in Detroit a few months before we sat on it, a 
couch right in the beating heart of an astonishingly vibrant 
underground art scene that’s still in its infancy.

The music was still thumping in the other room, but it got 

quiet where we were sitting as I stopped talking and started 
thinking about the realer side of “what the fuck are we doing 
here?” Maybe it’s OK to go bump around Detroit, sitting bewil-
dered on strange couches for a while in my twenties with no 
particular goal in mind.

At the same time, just sitting on a couch feels like a waste of 

space — I’d like to do something more to help the city and its 

culture, but do I have any right to think 
that I could or should help? I grew up 
in the suburbs fed on a steady diet of 
horror stories about urban blight and 
corrupt mayors and general post-apoc-
alyptic decay in Detroit. Before friends 
like David started inviting me to shows 
and really introducing me to the city, 
Detroit’s culture, for me, was limited 
to the Detroit Institute of Art, Eastern 
Market, Greektown, Tigers games and 
the occasional concert at Orchestra 
Hall — everything else in the city was 
just a foreboding network of wrecked 
houses and dark streets I was told to 
avoid driving around in at all costs. I’ve 
since learned that there are a whole lot 
of incredible artists living along those 
streets, and they’re immensely gener-
ous, community-minded, industrious 
and unbelievably talented. Things have 
been tough in Detroit for a long time, 
but the artists living and working there 
have built up a thriving culture through 
the struggle — they were doing fine 
before I started coming downtown to 
take new profile pictures, use up space 
on the couches and write articles about 
wondering what the fuck I’m doing 
there. Detroit was never my home, but 
maybe it will be one day. Yet would my 
presence there be adding something 
positive to the city and its culture, or 
just taking it out of the hands of the 
people who were there from the start?

Later that night David and I got off 

the couch and walked into the other 
room. My friend Martez was DJing 
a footwork set, dancing on a make-
shift stage in the middle of the room 
between song transitions. About half-
way through his set, a 40-something 
salt-and-pepper-haired 
white 
dude 

wearing three winter coats stepped up onto the stage and 
started waving his arms around as though he were doing tai 
chi. He alternated between undulating and rolling around on 
the ground for the next half hour, and nobody seemed to know 
what the fuck was going on (the way his eyes were bugging out 
of his head, I’m not sure he knew either). Nobody stopped him, 
but it kind of felt to me like I was watching the hostile takeover 
of a creative space. Martez kept DJing, and the guy kept doing 
his thing. Maybe it was performance art — just another weird 
art happening in Detroit, another addition to the surreal post-
modernist dreamscape that is the city’s arts scene.

Eventually a few people got on stage and started dancing 

with him. I looked around the room, wondering what every-
one else was thinking. I looked back toward the couch. My 
palms were sweating, and I didn’t know what to do with my 
hands.

Personal Statement: The Price of Loss

by Kayla Cantilla, Daily Staff Videographer

I 

have this awful habit of losing things.

Redness from windburn crept up my cheeks and numbed my nose on a chilly evening 

last December. As I kicked the leaves from side to side on the front lawn of a house on 

South Forest, the only thing running through my mind was “Thank god no one is home to 
judge the random girl roaming private property” because I looked utterly ridiculous. The 
sleet frosted each individual blade of grass in a wintry camouflage, ebbing at my resolve to 
prove Android Device Manager a worthy invention.

“It’s not here.”
“Yeah definitely not here.”
My two friends huddled on the sidewalk, the tallest boys I know, though height was 

unfortunately useless in this situation. As we trudged back toward South U, making new 
tracks in the crystal white snow, the lingering emptiness in my right back pocket brought to 
mind the nefarious qualities of tequila, salt and lime, but the panic and sadness that usually 
accompanies loss was entirely absent.

Loss is something I am much too familiar with.
After 27 room keys from Bursley hall, three MCards, four phones in 

one semester, my dignity every weekend, my trust in religion, 
my belief in love, any sense of direction in life, two good 
friends in high school, my grandparents and even 
my own stability every couple weeks or so, I 
have come to accept losing things as a 
fact of life.

The day after I lost my 

phone, I received 
an e-mail from 
my mom tell-
ing me my 
grand-
mother 
had 

approxi-
mately two weeks left to live — I felt numb. The emotions behind the chance of losing the 
woman who taught me how to cherish morning walks, to be strong and persevering despite 
low beginnings, to cook with a liberal amount of love and a dash of salt, to smile through 
language barriers and so much more felt synonymous to losing something as material and 
meaningless as my phone.

I’ve come to believe that we choose to lose certain things because we are afraid of what 

they will do to us when we find them again, and at some point in my life I ended up losing 
loss.

After a week of working double shifts, I bought myself a new phone, and as I dialed the 

numbers I hadn’t dialed in months, I stopped before I could press “call” because I didn’t 

know what to say or how to say it even if I did know. As I grew older and more concerned 
with my own life, I eventually stopped calling my grandmother every Sunday, and stopped 
flying out to California every summer. In hindsight I chose to lose that relationship — it was 
my fault. My grandmother had always represented a part of my biracial Chinese American 
identity, and when in high school I felt like I had to stop embracing the other half of my 
very mixed cultural identity, I let go of her as well. Wrapped up in trying to find belonging, 
I chose to lose everything that was ever actually important to me. Being numb isn’t as con-
venient as it sounds.

That night, I ended up dialing my mother’s number instead, and as she expressed her 

guilt to me over her tumultuous relationship with her own mother, she begged me to call 
my grandmother to advocate dialysis for prolonging her life. At that moment, finding myself 
between two eras, two people who loved each other so much they could not show they loved 
each other, between misunderstandings and an earnest desire to seek an impossible recon-
ciliation, it all came down on me at once.

I was supposed to go into studio to work on my finals, but I sat in my car in front of the 

art school and cried three years of pent up tears in three hours. Crumbling the resolve I 

carefully built by calcifying loss over brittle bones, they broke.

Pain is cathartic, a sign of healing, admitting that it’s OK to not be OK.

We get used to hurting after it becomes so familiar. The first pang of 
great loss knocks the wind out of us. Holding our fists to sternums we 

sway for a few moments, testing the impact by teetering on the 

edge of a downward spiral. But like unconsciously bracing a 

body against the wind, 

humans 
adapt: 

We become 

prepared 

and 

for-

get 

it’s 

even 

there. 

We settle 

for 
always 

being cold.

I once held this solipsistic ideal 

that in the end, I was the only thing I was sure of and could count on because when every-
thing seems to fail you, it’s easy to pretend you’re in control of yourself. In reality, I was the 
last thing I could control.

What are we but relative to everything else?
In embracing loss, I grew to value the people around me and the power I had in my place 

in the world, and to let myself risk the pain in caring. I am slowly understanding that with-
out loss, we surrender our empathy, our passion and our relation to a greater society. I lost 
my grandmother earlier the next year, but with her passing I gained a newfound sense of 
honesty to myself.

We must acknowledge loss to let ourselves meander toward what it means to be alive.
