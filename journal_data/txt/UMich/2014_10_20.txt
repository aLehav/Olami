resumes efforts
after raising over
$500K last year
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
Gravel and orange leaves

crunched under the shoes of
about 120 University students
and Ann Arbor residents Sunday
afternoon as they ran through the
Nichols Arb to raise money for
the University chapter of Dance
Marathon's Third Annual 5K For
the Kids.
The run raised $2,500 toward
DMUM's yearlong fundrais-
ing efforts to support pediatric
rehabilitation programs at the

University's C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Beaumont Chil-
dren's Hospital in Royal Oak. The
5K was DMUM's first major fun-
draising event of the year. Last
year, the organization raised over
$500,000 for pediatric rehabili-
tation programs in the University
of Michigan Health System's C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital and
Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak,
Mich.

Before running the traditional
5K, running a one-mile fun run
or walking the route, participants
were thanked and encouraged by
a few of the families who benefit
from DMUM's efforts.
DMUM Communications
Chair Brian Dobmeier, a Business
junior, was the first person to
break the blue ribbon at the end
of the run.

Symposium examines
global engagement,
collecting research
By GENEVIEVE HUMMER
For theDaily
About 200 people gathered at
the A. Alfred Taubman Biomedi-
cal Science Research Building for
the Fourth Annual Sujal Parikh
Memorial Symposium for Health
and Social Justice.
In 2010, University medical stu-
dent Sujal Parikh was killed in a
motorcycle accident in Kampala,
Uganda, where he was conduct-
ing AIDS research as a Fogarty
International Clinical Research
scholar.
"It was really started with
friends and colleagues that were
inspired by his story and inspired
by his ability to bring people
together," said medical student
Maia Anderson, the symposium's
student leadership chair.
The interdisciplinary event
aims to draw students interested
in medicine, law, pharmacy, busi-
ness and public health. Rackham

student Nadia Sebastian, a mem-
ber of the student planning board,
said it is designed to be a celebra-
lion of Farikh's life and an oppor-
tunity for students with similar
interests to discuss global health
and social justice issues.
This year the symposium was
designed to be as interactive as
possible, Anderson said. The event
featured two Design Thinking
Sessions, one titled "Re-Envision-
ing Global Engagement at UM"
and the other titled "What Comes
Next?" The event also featured
two keynote speakers, several
lightning talks and poster ses-
sions, which gave students and
faculty the opportunity to present
their research.
The first keynote speaker was
Dr. Vincent Iacopino, the senior
medical adviser at Physicians for
Human Rights and an adjunct pro-
fessor of medicine at the Univer-
sity of Minnesota Medical School.
Throughout his career, Iacopino
has traveled across the world
teaching people in underserved
areas how to better use available
tools to diagnose and treat diseas-
es. At the symposium, he stressed

DETROIT - Thousands of
runners paced anxiously on the
cold, brisk October morning
on W. Fort Street. In the dark,
donning disposable layers and

gloves, the runners awaited
the horn to signal the begin-
ning of the end of their months
of tireless training: the start of
the Detroit Free Press/Talmer
Bank Marathon.
Soon, the city's streets filled
with marathoners as thousands
funneled through the starting
line. Traveling over the Ambas-
sador Bridge, into Canada, back
through the Detroit-Windsor
Tunnel, through Mexican-
town, Corktown, Greektown,

Indian Village and Belle Isle,
the participants took a unique
tour of the city - and a bit of a
neighboring country.
Some took a shorter tour,
opting for running the more
manageable 13.1 miles offered
for both halves of the full dis-
tance. The first half of the mar-
athon - which runs through
Canada and offers a sunrise
view over the Ambassador
Bridge - hosted almost 14,000

NO AGREEMENT d
'U' fails to meet union demands

Forty years ago this week
(Oct.23,1974)
TheUniversityandtheGraduate
Employees Union failed to find
common ground in aseries of non-
economic demands included in
overall contract proposals.
The GEO proposals called for an
agency shop, class size limits and
affirmative action proposals, all
of which the University refused.
The University counter-proposal
also changed several provisions in
the GEO's proposal that the union
defined as non-negotiable.
"In the first place, they made
no response to a number of our
proposals," union spokesman
David Gordon said following
the bargaining session the night

before. "And secondly, what
they came back with was fairly
unsatisfactory."
University administrators
maintained at the time that
acquiescingto many of GEO's non-
economic demands "would have
shut the Universitydown."
Thirty years ago this week
(Oct.24,1984)

Quarantine ends for
those in contact with
U.S. native who died
from the disease
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -
As her boyfriend Thomas Eric
Duncan lay dying of Ebola in a
Dallas hospital bed, Louise Troh
battled loneliness and fear that
she too had contracted the dis-
ease while confined to a strang-
er's home under armed guard.
Troh's confinement was ending
Sunday night, along with several
friends, family and others who had
contact with Duncan after he first
became infectious. Ebola has a
21-day incubation period, and the
people who interacted with Dun-
can after he first arrived in Dallas
from Liberia will be in the clear.
It's an important milestone
in the nation's efforts to contain
the outbreak and a cause for cel-
ebration for Troh. After three long
H-i

weeks, she will be able to have a
clean bill of health, leave the house
and be done withtwice-dailytem-
perature readings by government
health care workers. She likened
the period to being a prisoner.
"I want to breathe, I want to
really grieve, I want privacy with
my family," Troh told The Asso-
ciated Press on Friday, lamenting
that she was missing Duncan's
memorial service at his mother's
church in North Carolina because
of the quarantine. Troh says she
and Duncan planned to get mar-
ried later in the week.
Duncan arrived in Dallas from
Liberia in late September and
went to the hospital complaining
of headache and stomach pain.
He was sent home with a pre-
scription for antibiotics to treat a
misdiagnosed sinus infection. He
returned two days later, was diag-
nosed with Ebola and died Oct. 8.
The day Duncan tested posi-
tive for Ebola, Troh, her 13-year-
old son, Duncan's nephew and
a family friend were ordered by
5-M

a Dallas court to stay inside the
apartment among Duncan's used
linens and any lingering virus.
The unusual confinement order
was imposed after the, family
failed to comply with a request
not to leave the apartment, Dallas
County Judge Clay Jenkins said.
The four were later taken to an
undisclosed gated community.
Jenkins and Troh's pastor
George Mason delivered the news
of Duncan's death to her during
the confinement period.
The other people who will have
their quarantine period end at
midnight include Youngor Jallah,
Troh's daughter, a nurse's assistant
who checked Duncan's vital signs
before calling for an ambulance.
For nearly three weeks, Jallah
has not left the cramped, second-
story apartment she shares with
her partner, Aaron Yah, their
three children, ages 2, 4 and 6, and
Yah's 10-year-old son.
Unlike Troh, Jallah is not pre-
vented from leaving by an armed
guard, but Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention officials
have come by daily to check every-
one's temperature.
"I'm tellingyou, just to step out-
side will be so great. To hug my
mom and grieve for Eric, not over
the phone like we've been doing
but in the flesh," Jallah said.
Mason said he is coordinat-
ing efforts with the city, county
and philanthropic community to
help Troh and the f amily recov-
er. Because of the Ebola infec-
tion risk, crews stripped Troh's
apartment down to the carpeting,
saving only a few personal docu-
ments, photographs and a Bible.
"They were left with nothing.
They are completely devastatedby
this, so there's need to have their
lives rebuilt," Mason said.
Troh plans to partially recover
financially with a book written
about her life, from growing up
in Liberia, meeting Duncan in
a refugee camp in Ivory Coast,
Duncan's years-long quest to
come to America to be reunited
with his girlfriend and their
19-year-old son, and his death in
an isolationward.

Former President Bill Clinton, right, speaks as fellow Democrat U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor listens at a political rally in Hot
Springs, Ark., Friday, Oct. 17.
Bill Clinton visits Arkansas
to boost Democratic vote

Former president
campaigns for
candidates in several
contested races
PINE BLUFF, Ark. (AP) -
Former President Bill Clinton
swept through a second Arkan-
sas campaign swing in as many
weeks Sunday, hoping to keep
Democrats in power at home and
in the U.S. Senate.
Clinton returned to Pine
Bluff, seeking the same political
successes he had here in 2000
and 2002. Late-in-the-campaign
rallies with predominantly black
crowds helped put Mike Ross in
the U.S. House and Mark Pryor
in the U.S. Senate then, and both
candidates need Clinton's help
"They assume you will show
up for a presidential election but
won't show up" for a midterm,
Clinton said. He cited polls that
he said showed that while black
people comprise 16 percent of
Arkansas' population, the GOP
expects blacks to make up just 11
percent of voters this year.
With andunpopular Demo-
cratic president in the White
House, Arkansas Republicans
have made unprecedented gains

since 2010. The GOP now con-
trols the state Legislature and
five of six seats in the U.S. House
and Senate.
"It's game time," said Pryor,
the lone Democrat whom Ar-
kansans send to Washington. "It
doesn't amount to a hill of beans
if we don't get out and vote."
Early voting begins Monday.
Ross is seeking the governor's
office against a former congress-
man who prosecuted Clinton's
impeachment and who has lost
three statewide races. Pryor is
seeking a third term and his con-
test with Rep. Tom Cotton is key
to control of the U.S. Senate.
Cotton's campaign said the
race is about the current presi-
dent, not a former one.
"We're not bothered by Presi-
dent Clinton's support for Mark
Pryor. We're bothered by Mark
Pryor's support for President
Obama, whom he has voted with
93 percent of the time," Cotton
spokesman David Ray said.
Clinton also campaigned Sun-
day for his former director of the
Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency, James Lee Witt,
and other statewide Democratic
candidates. Witt is running to
replace Cotton, a Republican
giving up a south Arkansas U.S.
House seat to challenge Pryor.
"You haven't had a congress-
man since I. left," said Ross,

who left the House in 2012. He
criticized Cotton for launching
a Senate campaign months after
entering Congress
Clinton didn't build the Dem-
ocratic PartyinArkansas buthas
been its figurehead since inherit-
ing the mantle from former U.S.
senators David Pryor and Dale
Bumpers. He spent much of Sun-
day's speech telling Arkansas
stories, and pointing out people
in the crowd, rather than pulling
out his presidential credentials.
David Pryor served two terms
as governor and is the current
senator's father. Bumpers, an-
other ex-governor, delivered a
passionate defense of Clinton at
the ex-president's impeachment
trial in 1999 - a case prosecuted
by then-Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
Ross' opponent this year. The
Republican-led House voted to
impeach Clinton but the Senate
acquitted him.
"This election is about the fu-
ture, and Asa's plan gives hope
for the future and will motivate
people to vote," Hutchinson
spokesman J.R. Davis said after
the Democratic rally.
Ross was a state legislator]
and a former driver for Clin-
ton's political campaigns when,
in 2000, he challenged Rep. Jay
Dickey, R-Ark., who had voted
for two articles of impeachment
against the president.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Groups discuss
water shutoffs
with UN experts
Advocacy groups and Detroit
residents testified Sunday about
city water shutoffs as United
Nations human rights experts
arrived to observe the impact on
low-income residents.
Hundreds of people attended a
town hall meeting Sunday after-
noon.
"Once again, the international
spotlight was on Detroiters trying
to carve out dignified lives while
being denied basic necessities of
life," Maureen Taylor, spokesman
for the Michigan Welfare Rights
Organization and the Detroit
People's Water Board, said in pre-
pared remarks.
The groups, which helped
organize the event, said in a state-
ment that a judge overseeing
Detroit's municipal bankruptcy
case "denied residents a right to
water and a water affordability
plan, both of which make the lack
of access to water and sanitation
dire for poor families and critical
for public health."

Hawaii residents
relax as hurricane
threat eases
Hurricane Ana has passed
the Hawaiian island of Niihau,
leaving the state wet but largely
unscathed.
Hawaii residents are begin-
ning to relax after days of keeping
a cautious eye on Hurricane Ana.
National Weather Service fore-
casters say the closest Ana got to
Hawaii was about 70 miles south-
west of Niihau Sunday.
Hurricane Ana had been
churning dangerously close for
several days, spinning parallel to
the islands where residents were
urged to be ready.
Instead the storm mainly
stayed to the southwest, bringing
little more than heavy rain and
big waves.
A tropical storm warning
remains in effect Sunday for the
islands of Kauai and Niihau, and a
hurricane watch has been issued
for parts of remote northwestern
islands, home to a largely unin-
habited marine sanctuary.

the Asia-Pacific region, Kerry is
leading the U.S. delegation to the
inauguration of new Indonesian

President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo,
a reformer who won hotly con-
tested elections in July.
Kerry arrived in the capital,

"It felt good to finish first for
the Dance Marathon 5K, not
necessarily because of the place
finish, but because of what the
5K means for the kids," Dobmei-
er said. "Through an event like
this with every person raising
$20, you can raise over $2,000
for a great organization really
quick just by having people
show up. It's really exciting that
we were able to do that for the
children."
This year, DMUM is empha-
sizing collaboration with other
student organizations and
the Ann Arbor community.
Throughout the year, the group
will partner with MRelay, Blood

Battle and Musket to host fund-
raisingevents.
"We've been focusing a lot on
student organization partner-
shipsthis year because there's so
many student orgs and we're all
competing for the same things:
participation and fundraising,"
said Amal Muzaffar, a Business
senior and DMUM fundraising
events chair.
"We've seen this year that
partnering with other student
organizations really helps us
achieve our goals with fundrais-
ing and just getting the word
out."
Some of DMUM's upcoming
events include a Halloween Bar
Night at Scorekeepers Bar and
Grille thisweekend and a formal
gala at the Sheraton Ann Arbor
Hotel in early November where

participants will get to meet
many of the DMUM families.
There will also be a fundraising
competition against Ohio State
University's chapter of Dance
Marathon in the 10days leading
up to the Michigan-Ohio State
football game.
"I'm excited to get to meet
the families and to get to know
the kids that we actually get to
help," said Kinesiology sopho-
more Rachel Tomassi, DMUM

the importance of not only under-
standing medicine, but also the
social issues that surround it.
Jonathan Shaffer, coordinator
for community engagement at the
global health nonprofit Partners
In Health, was the second key-
note speaker. He discussed health
care as a fundamental human
right and the work that Partners
In Health performs, including
building hospitals in countries
such as Haiti and Rwanda.
The daylong event was a testa-
ment not only to Parikh's legacy,
but also to the issues that he cared
about.
Parikh's father, Manoj Parikh,
began taking his son to volunteer
at their Hindu temple in Dallas,
Texas each Sunday when Sujal
was four years old. This early
exposure to volunteerism as well
as the work of civil rights leader
Mahatma Gandhi inspired Sujal
to devote his life to promoting
peace and social justice around

the world.
Parikh was an Eagle Scout,
earned degrees in neurobiology
and public health from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley,
served on the Student Advisory
Board of Physicians for Human
Rights and won a Campus Inde-
pendent Journalism Award for
best political commentary for his
2006 piece condemningthe death
penalty, titled "A New Vision of
Justice."
"He told me one time, 'Dad, I'd
like to go on the edge of an active
volcano, on the crater of an active
volcano,' and he did that in Rwan-
da in 2007, the Gometz Volcano,"
Manoj Parikh said about his son.
Medical student Megha Trive-
di, Parikh's cousin, emphasized
Parikh's passion for serving man-
kind and eradicating the injustic-
es he encountered.
"If he saw this today he would
want it to be more about the issues
- social justice, global health
disparities, more than himself,"
Trivedi said. "And that's what he
worked for all his life."

those with disabilities.
Whittington said it is often
difficult to reach out to stu-
dents with disabilities and
encourage themtoget involved
in support groups because
of the stigma that can come
with being labeled as disabled.
Beyond the stigma that makes
it difficult to involve students
with available support groups,
Whittington said having a dis-
ability also impacts the way he
interacts with others.
"Being a native stutterer, it
really just forces you to choose
your words in a certain type of

way," he said.
Shelton added that, like
race, having a disability is
another aspect of identity that
can be marginalizing and can
add another layer of difficulty
to his life.
"The more identities we
have that are different from
the norm, the more energy we
have to exert," Shelton said.
"The further you differenti-
ate from that profile of white,
male, able-bodied, straight ...
the harder you have to try."
The conference also includ-
ed remarks from Dean of Stu-
dents Laura Blake Jones; E.
Royster Harper, vice president
for Student Life; Jack Bernard,
associate general counsel and
chair of the University's Coun-

cil for Disability Concerns;
and Regent Katherine White,

versity's Board of Regents.
The first keynote speaker,
John Greden, director of the
University's Comprehen-
sive Depression Center, said
though depression is the dis-
ability that impacts themost
people in the world, many peo-
ple don't view it as a disability.
Law Prof. Samuel Bagens-

participants, and was the day's
most popular event.
Mike Andersen of Walled
Lake, Mich. who coaches cross
country at Milford High School,
was the first to cross the mara-
thon's finish line in 2:24:54.
Andersen overcame University
alum Zach Ornelas, who won
the 2013 marathon, in their final
strides of the race. Ornelas, who
dealt with a hip injury through-
out the year, finished in 2:25:13.
The Detroit Marathon isan
the rise. Hitting a record-break-'
ing number of participants this
year with 27,389 runners, the
marathon is more than an event;
it's a spectacle. Sandwiched
between two of the most popu-
lar marathons in the world - the
Bank of America Chicago Mara-
thon and the New York City
Marathon on Oct. 12 and Nov.
2, respectively - runners have a
host of options for their choice of
marathon. And for Detroit, the
runners keep coming.
Executive Race Director
Barbara Bennage said runners
represented 48 states and 19
countries. She attributed the
marathon's success to "the vibe
that's coming out of Detroit" and
the appeal of the international
component to the race. Despite
its national draw, she said 80
percent of participants come
from the Metro Detroit area.
"I think it's people that love
the city and love what's happen-
ing to it," Bennage said after one
of her staff members handed her
a paper reporting the record-
breaking total of the partici-
pants.
Each runner has a specific
reason for running the 13.1 or
26.2 miles. Some, as Bennage
said, want to cross it off their
bucket lists. Some want to set
a personal record. Some want
to qualify for the Boston Mara-
thon. Others are influenced by
loved ones.
Randal Brown, who lives in

Detroit, decided to run the mar-
athon after his close friend and
mentor passed away. Though he
did not consider himself a run-
ner before, he completed the
marathon in 3:27:39 - which
beat the average marathon time
for men in 2013 of 4:16:00.
"It was a lot of fun and a lot of
people cheered. It's worth it. It's
good for the city," Brown said
at the finish line, catching his
breath.
Tom Claflin of Brighton,
Mich. has run 20 marathons,
and said the Detroit Marathon
stands out due to its unique
course. At age 66, Claflin started
tunning eight years ago, and said
he had the "perfect race" Sun-
day.
"It's terrific," he said. "Over
the bridge with the sunrise and
back through the tunnel, it's
much better than anybody who
would go through the tunnel
with a car would know."
With two of his sons based in
Ann Arbor, Claflin said he usual-
ly visits there more than Detroit,
though he hopes to travel back to
the city more often.
For Ornelas, a former member
of the University's men's cross
country team and winner of his
first marathon in Detroit's 2013
event, the spirit of Detroit drew
him to the marathon for a sec-
ond go. Having lived in Texas
before attending the University,
Ornelas said the marathon gave
him a unique tour of the city that
seems so far from the Ann Arbor
"bubble," as he called it.
After graduating from the
School of Education, Ornelas
now teaches at the Jalen Rose
Leadership Academy in Detroit
- a job, he said, he earned with
help from his 2013 Detroit
Marathon performance. The
experience gave him a unique
perspective of Detroit - one
that students may not always
see. In a survey conducted by
The Michigan Daily, only 22
percent of the 230 randomly
selected undergraduates said
they would consider living in
the city after graduation.

For many college students,
Detroit's portrayal in popular
media paints a negative pic-
ture of the city. While in col-
lege, Ornelas said he found it
"di-heartening" when friends
w'' Id make jokes about Detroit,
calling it dangerous and warn-
ing others against traveling to
it.
"I'd encourage students to
stop talking about Detroit nega-
tively," he said in an interview
before Sunday's marathon.
"They're quick to do it - and
that's because that's what we're
used to - but they need to stop."
Ornelas said he was exposed
to 'parts of tfie 'city by running
through it that he had never
seen and had previously only
imagined based on the image of
Detroit painted in the media.
"I got to see just how tough
a lot of the people have it," he
said. "We all think we know, but
it's different once you're there."
Behind the finish line and
throughout the race, 3,000 vol-
unteers handed participants
water, offered motivation and
greeted finishers with Gatorade,
water, bananas and medals.
University alum Leah Ouel-
let, one of the volunteers,
brought high school students to
help at the race. Ouellet works
at buildOn - a nonprofit based
in Detroit that aims to engage
students with community ser-
vice in the city. Ouellet said she
knew she would work in Detroit
immediately after graduating
from the University in 2013.
"Having it happen in Detroit
at this time, you can tell there
are a lot of people who don't live
or work here that came down,
so it's a cool cosmopolitan event
with a lot of people in the city
to help with the rebranding of
Detroit," she said.
As participants recover and
take a week - or many - off
from running, the preparation
for next year's race has only just
begun.

DAVIS

The Inclusive Language Campaign was
launched by Student Life with the
stated goal of wanting "to encourage
the campus community to
consider the impact of their
word choices on others."
The premise is noble. More
so in a town like Ann Arbor,
where in any given class-
room or restaurant booth, a
multitude of characters and
identities are likely present.
Words are a powerful TYLER
thing, and taking the SCOTT
initiative to help reduce
the frequency with which
certain labels or remarks may affect the
general happiness of a person is a worthy cause.
Especially when considering that all the ILC
is asking of its participants is to give a second
thought to language and the way we employ it.
Yet, any time the capacity for human
expression is diminished I'm wary about
jumping on board. More than likely, it's an
indication of my own privilege that I don't
necessarily believe that anyone should be kept
from expressing themselves using whichever
words they please - yes, even the worst ones.
That sort of behavior should be regulated
not by an institutional campaign, but by daily
social justice, and the ILC is only a substitute
for exactly this.
The most lauded line from supporters
of movements like the Inclusive Language
Campaign always draws a firmbut unclear line,
stating that we should all steer clear of using
any term that someone may find offensive ...
because you never know who's listening.
Practically, there is one major problem
with this. Spoken language - and not just the
bad parts - is inherently shaped and molded
by popular use. As we continue to grow and
chase ignorance out of the corners of social
awareness, both society and individuals learn
more about how terms that used to be common
exchange are now taboo, offensive.
It's a good thing we keep an ear out for our
fellowman,butwithacloseenoughmicroscope,
everything starts to look dirty. For example, in
this column it has been exactly one-and-a-half
sentences since I linguistically marginalized
over half of the world's population.
I could vouch to use fellow men, women,
transgenders, non-indentifiers and others for
the purpose of inclusion. But does it do any
good if I spend less time writing - less time
trying to spark conversation - and more time
worrying about how someone could see this
and might getoffended?
Of course, anyone in the same camp as I
am who uses the timeless "sticks and stones"
proverb as justification for being an ignorant
ass is a liar. Words contain all the hatred and

menace in the world, along with all the beauty,
and they're as effective a tool for ruining
someone's day as anything else.
However the ILC puts the burden on the
speakers of these words, and as only a social
movement itself, it is a far cry from anything
resembling censorship, but I would rather
make a mistake and be corrected than clamp
my tongue for fear of my own ignorance and
insensitivity.
I was telling this to a friend. And in
between breaths when I was extolling the
profound worth of unrestricted human
expression, communication and creativity,
she said something that I glossed over at the
time - she probably thought I didn't hear her
- but I did, and it resonates with me now.
"Sometimeswords can really bother people."
She said it, and with the expression of
someone who knew personally what that was
like. She wasn't talking about being offended;
she spoke of being truly hurt.
I'm notsure that it changed my mind any, but
it completely transformed my perspective, and
suddenly I saw the ILC in new light.
On a societal level, I still believe that
withholding remark for fear of offense is
detrimental to social discourse and progress.
However, on an individual basis, the ILC
becomes less about expression and more about
how personal thoughts and beliefs take shape.
Inclusion becomes less of a term used to
mean including the possibility for others to
disagree, and more about listening to more
than a singular internal voice - more about
considering the position, experiences and
value of other human beings.
Even using the worst ethnic slur in the books
is not as crushing to the soul as when someone
doesn't care, considering in my own life the
number of times I have failed at listening.
Times when, both intentionally and as a result
of my own arrogance, I concluded that besides
agreeing with me, there wasn't a whole hell of a
lot else to add to a discussion.
It means more than hurting someone's
feelings. The saddest and most meaningful
consideration the ILC should raise is a
consideration for the sheer multitudes of
others who at this point are probably pretty
well convinced that I don't truly care about
anything they have to say.
Unfortunately, they may have been right.
The very existence of the ILC speaks to the
magnitude of this phenomenon. So many of us
say so many things, hardly without pause for
breath orthought.
The Inclusive Language Campaign isn't
about how we should speak. What it's really
about is how we listen.

towhenthespread
of Ebola may finally come under
control. Adding to the uncertainty,
broadcast reports detailing Ebola's
increasing dissemination across
West Africa elicit scenes from "I
Am Legend" and other zombie
apocalypse films, which can seem
pretty terrifying. Because of this,
Americans are left wondering
when the disease will make its way
from the streets of Monrovia and
Freetown to their own picket-fenced
blocks. Though these concerns
may seem legitimate for reasons
of public health and safety, they
are indeed farfetched, and frankly,
completely egocentric.
Yes, there have been a handful of
cases of the virus to date in the Unit-
ed States since March, when an out-
break of unidentified hemorrhagic
fever in Guinea was identified as the
Ebola virus. In August, two Ameri-
can missionaries working in Liberia
contracted the disease while abroad,
and were flown stateside under quar-
antine in order to receive treatment;
both were released from the hospital
at the end of the month after having
been deemed disease-free. Drawing
considerably more headlines was
the infection of Liberian Thomas
Eric Duncan, who contracted the
virus in his home country before
traveling to Dallas to visit family.
Duncan began showing symptoms
of Ebola in Dallas, and eventually

died while undergoing treatment.
Two nurses assigned to Duncan's
case subsequently contracted the
disease while caring for the dying
man, and have now been flown to
centers in Atlanta and Maryland in
order to receive treatment.
If these cases are exaggerated,
then it could be said that Ebola has
begun to spread within American
borders. But in viewing the reality
of the facts surrounding these cases,
they are indeed isolated incidents.
HealthcareworkerstreatingDuncan
only contracted the disease as they
routinely came into contact with
the man's bodily fluids; contrary to
popular conception, this is the only
way to contract Ebola. Furthermore,
the two cases of United States-
originated Ebola pale in comparison
to the number of cases of other,
everyday diseases. Influenza and
pneumonia, for example, though
both completely treatable, combined
are the eighth leading cause of death
in the United States. There are
definitely much more worrisome
public health concerns in the United
States than the slight chance of an
Ebola outbreak.
Scientists, the President and even
Fox News - whose viewership,
according to a study from 2003, has
been found tobe positively correlated
with political misconceptions -
have tried'to make this fact clear in
an attempt to calm public unease.
However, politicians are still
posing query into the truth behind
the few cases of infection in the
United States.
At a hearing last Thursday, for
example, the men and women of
Congress interrogated Dr. Thomas
Frieden, the director of the Centers
for Disease Control, about how two
health care workers could have been
prone to infection given the nature
of the quarantine under which Mr.
Duncan was placed. The caliber and
tone of the questions implied that
they doubted claims that the disease

isn't contagious through airborne
transmission.
The doubt under which expertsin
the medical field are being placed by
our congressional leadership is toxic
to the public's views on this disease.
Instead of listening to experts,
taking advice and implementing
preventative measures to ensure
that Ebola- should itsincidence rise
in the United States - doesn't get
out of hand, congressional leaders
are fueling ignorance and fear about
the disease.
If patients are properly
quarantined, provided intravenous
fluids, monitored for proper levels
of oxygen and blood pressure, and
given enough time to develop the
necessary antibodies, Ebola is
relatively treatable; even in African
countries where treatment options
are scarce,those infected have still
survived in an average of50-percent
of cases. The United States - with
ready access to state-of-the-art
medical equipment and money with
which to fund further research for
a cure - is more than capable of
effectively handlingthis disease; the
only reason why Ebola has spread
with such voracity in West Africa is
that these factors are lacking.
The conversation about the
chance of an outbreak of Ebola in the
United States is clogging social and
conventional media with speculation
instead of fact. Americans desper-
ately need to see the bigger picture
here: people are dying in Africa, not
in the United States. Drawing atten-
tion away from this fact is completely
immoral and selfish. Americans need
to educate themselves on the disease
instead of resorting to unfounded
fears. Doing this will better equip us
as anationto aidthosewhomthedis-
ease is truly affecting: impoverished
Africans without the resources to
treat patients effectively.

Protest in Ann Arbor -business as usual

The price of fintegrity
TO THE DAILY:
The economic slump has been
affecting the state of Michigan ever
since the global recession of 2008;
state funding for higher education
decreased by almost a third between
then and 2012. To make up for the
continuous loss in funding, the
University has again increased its
fees (1.6 percent for in-state students
and 3.4 percent for non-residents
next year) and organized fundraising
campaigns, like the $4 billion Victors
for Michigan campaign (which had
raised $2.2 billion as of June 1, 2014).
Since I personally believe that
maintaining the high standards and
quality of Michigan comes at a high
cost (e.g., to attract top professors

and to undertake more breakthrough
research), I understand the aggres-
sive donation campaigns and pain-
ful but necessary tuition increases
undertaken by the University. How-
ever, I am concerned if we were to
over-rely on major private donations,
given the culture of donating.
Donations of six figures and
higher don't really go unnoticed
and "unrewarded." Several Univer-
sity buildings have been renamed
in honor of their donors, and resi-
dences are constructed in order to
fulfill the requests of the donors.
Although I have to admit that Ross
School of Business has a catchy
name to it, and I believe that donors
should have the first preference in
deciding where their money should
go, the naming rights of buildings

are the least of my concerns.
Instead, to what extent will the
University honor our donors? Will
we stop at naming rights, or will we
undergo self-censorship in order
not to offend the "donors" who
might pull the plug? Although I am
positive that academic integrity
will be upheld by the administra-
tion, the recently discovered "rela-
tionship" between the Florida State
University Economics Department
and the Charles Koch Foundation,
in which the latter has report-
edly attempted to influence the
appointments of faculties through
donations, makes me wonder if our
integrity does have a price.

Three weeks ago, the national media poured
into Ann Arbor to cover a protest over the
recentevents surrounding the school's football
team. The mainstream media portrayed the
protest as some isolated eventbased on specific
circumstances. Obviously, the press is very
unfamiliar with the most politically active and
socially conscious city and university in all of
America - maybe the entire world.
If the media wanted to cover a protest on
the campus and paid close attention, they
would have the opportunity on a daily basis.
Michigan breeds independent thinking and
has provided a constant flow of rebellion for
many years in the past, and will do the same
for the remainder of time.
Beingableto protestorhold demonstrations
at Michigan happens freely on a daily basis.
Any visitor to the main gathering place on the
campus, the Diag, may observe one group of
protesters on their initial stroll and witness an
entirely new group upon a return visit.
Whether the situation involves born-
again Christians, Hare Krishnas, Orthodox
Jews, Liberals, Conservatives, the National
Organization for Women or Gay and Lesbian
groups, all are welcome to share their views to
whomever wants to listen. In turn, those who
disagree with others' respective stances can
come forth and state their own case. On many
occasions, crowds of hundreds of students will
engage in lively debates, even though their
next class has already started.
What better education could students
have, than being able to express their views
in an open forum and have them challenged?
Always questioning authority and expressing
one's opinion is just part of the curriculum.
Any student that does not participate in
the banter is missing one of the best things
Michigan has to offer.
Where did the inaugural protests of the

Vietnam War begin? Ann Arbor. After the
first Students for a Democratic Society teach-
in (March 1965) took place at the University,
more than 3,000 students attended, and the
pace of demonstrations accelerated across
the country.
Where was marijuana first decriminalized?
In Ann Arbor. In 1967, the student newspaper,
The Michigan Daily, urged for the legalization
of marijuana, but it was not until an ordinance
was passed in 1972 that it was decriminalized.
The end result: the ordinance reduced city
penalties for less than two ounces to a $5 civil
infraction ticket (just about the same penalty
as a parking ticket at the time).
Now, marijuana is legalized for public sale
for private use in a few states and widely
accepted for medicinal purposes. It only took
these states more than 40 years to replicate
the policies already in place in Ann Arbor
for decades.
Why did the media flock to Ann Arbor to
cover the protest? Could it have something
to do with the constant headlines about the
concussion issue in the NFL, that they did not
want to miss out on the next news event that
even remotely focused on concussions? After
all, the status of the football team's recent woes
is certainly not worthy of national attention.
So the next time the media pours into Ann
Arbor to cover a protest, let's pray they can
place the event in its proper historical perspec-
tive, and not produce an oversimplification
that merely portrays a group of students that
is unhappy with the status of their football
team. Instead, the press should treat student
unrest with the proper respect it deserves, by
recognizing how protest is embedded in every
hallway, classroom and common area at the
University of Michigan.

Is Common Core the
right direction for
Michigan?
TO THE DAILY:
Compared to the National
Assessment of Educational Progress
achievement levels in 2009, Michi-
gan's state proficiency standards for
both reading and math were classi-
fied as Below Basic. Many believe
the solution to education reform lies
in the adoption of the Common Core
State Standards, but that may not be
the best solution for Michigan.
The Michigan State Board of
Education adopted the standards in
June 2010. Districts across the state
are in the process of implementing
the Common Core in the hopes

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

of improving state education.
However, not all agree with the
shift of standards. Local reading
specialist Valerie Ifill is not opposed
to the Common Core standards, but
believes there are other issues that
need to be addressed first before
the standards can be considered
effective. She believes a lack of
resources is the biggest issue facing
schools. According to Ifill, "If the
resources were there, then (the
Common Core)-could possibly be a
good thing because it would raise
the bar and American kids would be
taught more effectively."
Every Michigan child deserves
an adequate education. From
Ifill's experience, teachers are
overwhelmed with "too much
work, too much paperwork, and not
enough resources, and too many
kids." We cannot adequately reform

education without addressing these
concerns first.
According to Tom Loveless
of the Brookings Institution,
implementing the Common Core
standards will not significantly
affect the performance of Michigan
students compared to students in
states that have not adopted the
standards. The state's focus should
not be on changing standards, but
on changing school conditions so
teachers can teach more effectively.
"Changing the curriculum every
five minutes, that's really hard on
the system," Ifill stated. Continuing
to implement the Common Core
standards may only make things
worse for education in Michigan.

We are the Now Generation.
The generation of instant
gratification. We want what
we want, when we want it,

e-mail is too slow a form
of communication. Our
Twitter and Instagram feeds
continuously update like a
never-ending filtered fantasy;
a competition of who's better
than whom. Recent additions
to the Oxford Dictionaries,
courtesy of our generation,
include humblebrag, First
World Problem and selfie -
the culmination of our own
admiration that has inspired
television series, taglines and
an endless obsession with
cameras that point at our
own faces. We are the Now
Generation.
In the future, we'll
reminisce with our children
about a time when television
was an engagement - when
you had to sit down in front
of one device at the same
exact time as millions of
strangers. Before Netflix.
Before DVR. A time when
if you wanted to watch
"Friends," you did so
Thursday night at 8 p.m. But
in the 10 years since that NBC
comedy ended, everything's

changed.
Netflix will always have
the distinction of being the
first; its signature red logo
synonymous with streaming
and binge culture. It's the
service that pioneered online
television with "House of
Cards" and "Orange Is The
New Black" and made its
streaming website the envy
of the industry. And it's that
proliferation into the cultural
zeitgeist that has encouraged
consumers - consumers of
our generation - to demand
more and more from our
television screens (or our
television shows that we
actually now watch on our
phones and tablets).
Starting in 2015, Time
Warner and HBO will make
a long-rumored move: HBO
Go, direct to consumer.
Though the specifics of the
deal are still developing,
the service will presumably
offer the premium network's
vast catalog of series and
films - including originals
like "Game of Thrones,"
"The Sopranos" and "The
Normal Heart," as well as
theatricals from partners like
Warner Bros. and Universal
- all without any cable
subscription.
Like HBO paved the way
for original cable television,
the network will likely set off
an industry chain reaction
of offerings in the streaming
sphere; most networks
already feature streaming as
a supplement to their cable
package. From HBO Go to
Showtime Anytime to FX
Now, any network has the
means to make a similar play.
But this entire future will
hinge on HBO Go's yet-to-be-
released pricing plan. For us
Gen Y kids, that ideal world
in which you only pay for the
servicesyou want, and any:
content on any network is
just a click away, is still yet
to come.
Streaming doesn't
eliminate consumers'
reliance on cable companies,
who will continue to provide
the Internet service needed
*to access HBO Go or Netflix.
And as long as they're in
charge, they'll make sure
it's cheaper for you to add
a full TV service to your
Internet package than to pick

and choose from standalone
services that would bypass
their TV offerings entirely.
For the same price - or
less - as subscribing to
a selection of streaming
services, you'll be able to
buy a full premium cable
service from Comcast or
Verizon; HBO, Showtime and
all the series about murder
investigations and cupcake
baking battles you don't
watch or even know exist, but
also don't realize are actually
a good investment to make.
One thing is certain,
however. Time Warner
and HBO set off industry
fireworks. Just one day after
the HBO Go announcement,
CBS unveiled its own
streaming service - CBS
All Access. For six dollars
per month, All Access
will offer thousands of
episodes of present and
past programming (which
includes "Twin Peaks" and
"Star Trek"), as well as the
most up-to-date episodes
of current series (like "The
Good Wife"). And that's not
all; in 14 of CBS' biggest
markets (including New
York City, Los Angeles
and Detroit), All Access
will offer live streaming
of network programming.
In addition to the monthly
fee, the content will still
include advertisements -
and let's not forget CBS
is still technically a free
network. But despite being
shrouded beneath the
cloud of HBO Go frenzy,
CBS' announcement was
deceivingly groundbreaking;
the country's No. 1 network
getting Generation
Y-friendly.
We are the Now
Generation, and television
- once appointment
entertainment - is becoming
yet another thing we can
take control of. Go. Anytime.
All Access. What you want.
When you want it. Where you
want it. This is the beginning
of the most revolutionary
change since color television.
Sit back, relax and enjoy the
stream.

'Fury' exposes. the
horrors of comb at

By KARSTEN SVIOLINSKI
DailyArts Writer
During World War II,
American Sherman tanks found
themselves outgunned and
out-armored
by the much A-
larger German Fury
Tiger tanks. For
an American Raveand
crew, their tank Qualityl6
became both Columbia
their home and
their potential
tomb. "Fury" gives audiences
an intimate vision of how
these tank crews worked with
their tanks, with one another
and with the mass death that
defined their daily lives.
Taking place during the
final days of the war in
Europe, the film follows the
veteran crew of a Sherman
tank named Fury and their
latest addition,. a typist with
no training or experience. It's
easy to reduce these characters
to stereotypes: the battle
hardened sergeant, the bible
thumper, the redneck, the one
non-white crewman and the
rookie. However, great writing
and acting reveal a depth
beneath the surface of each.
The bloodthirsty sergeant, Don
"Wardaddy" Collier (Brad Pitt,
"Inglorious Bastards") desires
the civility of a peaceful meal,
and the bible thumper (Shia
LeBeouf, "Transformers") kills
as mercilessly as the next man.

"Fury" really tells two
perfectly intertwined stories.
One is the story of a tank
crew steeped in cynicism
and camaraderie and their
struggle to survive to the war's
end. Their personalization
of Fury - the pinups, photos
and war trophies - makes
their attachment to the tank
feel very real. Also, despite
rarely getting along, their
synchronicity during battle
shows their deep reliance
on one another. When they
repeatedly say, "best job I ever
had," they're half joking and
half serious.
The second story is of an
innocent young man, Norman
Ellison (Logan Lerman, "3:10
to Yuma"), transformed by war
into an eager killer. It may seem
like a quick transition from
cleaning up the blood and flesh
of his predecessor to mowing
down dozens of Nazis, but the
atrocities he witnesses makes
the process believable. The
film's brutal gore, including'
bodies beheaded by tank shells
or flattened by tank treads,
displays the horror of war in
stark perspective. Eventually,
both Norman and the viewers
come to accept Wardaddy's
philosophy: "Ideals are
peaceful, history is violent."
Though the horrors of war
as seen through the lens of
WWII may seem like a well-
worn subject, the focus on a
tank crew helps "Fury"

stand out from the pack. One
notable scene captures the
terrifying power of a Tiger tank
as shell after shell bounces off
its armor. A unique tension
develops while watching
two tanks dance around one
another, each vying to score a
hit on the other.
Unfortunately, in a movie so
full of memorable moments,
the most disappointing scene
turns out to be the climactic
battle. In the film's most cliche
moment, German soldiers miss
their mark repeatedly while
American bullets find their
targets every time. The film
editing makes the heroes seem
hopelessly surrounded but
also makes audiences wonder
how they aren't getting shot
in the back. The course and
conclusion of the battle feel
utterly predictable.
Not particularly engaging as
an action movie, "Fury" stands
more strongly as a dramatic
testament to the horrible acts
humankind is capable of doing
to itself. Though the American
soldiers constantly demonize
the Nazis, a small gesture
at the film's end reaffirms
the humanity of the German
soldier. The separation of good
and evilbecomes as confused as
a soldier lost in the thunderous
noise and fog of war. The film's
final words, "you're a hero,
buddy," ring hollow in the
audience's ears.

FILM REVIEWW
'Children' falters
in social critiques

By VANESSA WONG
For The Daily
In an age where everything
and everyone is just a text, tweet,
or Tinder swipe away, technology
permeates
everyday +
routines in a
way that didn't Men,
ten years ago. Women &
Jason Reitman's
("Juno") "Men, e n
Women & State Theater
Children" Paramount
explores that
effect with little
success.
The film follows a wide cast
of teenagers and their parents,
each of whose life choices and
pathways are directly affected
by technology. The scope is
diverse and tackles many facets,
positive and negative, of these
interactions. Tim (Ansel Elgort,
"The Fault in Our Stars") is a
former football star who turned
to playing online RPGs after
his mother left his dad. His love
interest, Brandy (Kaitlyn Dever,
"Bad Teacher") seeks privacy
from her strict mother (Jennifer
Garner, "Dallas Buyers Club"),
who obsessively reads through
all of Brandy's online profiles.
Hannah (Olivia Crocicchia, "Palo
Alto") posts provocative photos
of herself online in hopes of

jumpstarting her acting career.
Don Truby (Adam Sandler,
"Grown Ups") and Helen Truby
(Rosemary DeWitt, "The Odd
Life of Timothy Green"), a couple
bored with their marriage,
experiment with online dating
sites and escort services on the
sly.
There'ssomewhatofadisparity
between how high school kids
actually interact with technology
and how the film portrays them.
The issues it tackles are real and
show a deft view of Internet
culture, but doesn't always
grasp the teenagers' motivations
behind their actions. When
Tim talks about forming online
friendships through avideo game,
he uses the abbreviation "IRL
friends" (meaning "in real life")
in actual real life conversation.
Cue cringing. It's intended as a
comedic moment to mock the
linguistic change brought on by
texting and instant messaging,
but people don't actually act
like that. Instead, it takes on a
moralizing tone that seems to
come from an adult fascinated
by the advent of technology that
doesn't quite get it.
On the other hand, some of the
storylines work well. Allison's
(Elena Kampouris, "Labor Day")
efforts to impress a guy who only
likes her for her looks bring on
an eating disorder. She looks up

pictures ofskinny girls online and
uses an online support system to
motivate her not to eat. It only
occupies a small percent of screen
time, but it is raw and real.
Alongside all the complex
subplots, there's an overarching
theme, centered on Carl Sagan's
Pale Blue Dot, that none of it
matters. The film opens and ends
with with a too-long shot of the
Voyager space probe overlooking
the earth. The ideais that as seen
from space, the earth is just a pale
blue dot, so in the grand scheme
of the universe, human life and all
the complicated issues that come
with it are meaningless. On its
own, this could work, but stated
in a way that is so pretentious to
the point of satire, it's hard to take
this message seriously. It gets
hammered in constantly, with
shots from space interspersed
throughout the movie and a grand
total of three direct references
to the same concept in the same
book.
Maybe it's because it uses a
subject matter too intimately
connected to our generation,
but though "Men, Women &
Children" successfully ties in
many facets of the Internet's
effects,itdoesn'tshednewlighton
its cultural significance. Besides,
if you really ever wondered about
how technology changes your
life, you could always just ask Siri.

Shteyngarttouread
from new 'Failure'

By GILLIAN JAKAB
Community & Culture Editor
As a high school senior in 1991,
Gary Shteyngart almost came
to the University of Michigan.
Now the award-
winning authorG

The Russian .I
Debutante's HIS

visiting Ann Mmir,
Arbor 23 years
later to read 'little
from his recent Failure'
memoir "Little
Failure." The Oct.21 at7:00pm
memoir ranges Ann Arbor
from hilarity District Library
to melancholy
as it takes us from his birth in
1972 Leningrad, the Shteyngart
family's move to New York in
1979, the travails of his just-off-
the-boat household in the land
of sweepstakes, promises and
brutal schoolboy pecking orders,
his years at Oberlin and in New
York as a young writer, and
finally to his return to Russia as a
tourist. Shteyngart's readers will
recognize in "Little Failure" the
many ingredients cooked into his
three prior novels.
But a memoir is very different
from fiction, Shtyengart reminds
us in his trademark satirical
style.
"Well it's fun to mind the
past, but you have to be - you
can't lie," Shteyngart said in an
interview with the Michigan
Daily. "It's all about the truth.
That's different for somebody
who is used to lying, which is
what anovelistdoes allthe time."
In chasing the truth about his
own life, Shteyngart found, for
various reasons, that he needed to
research the secondary sources.
"I had to sit down with a
lot of people and talk about it
- especially college; it's hard
to remember because i was so
stoned," Shteyngart said. "High
school too, I can't remember
much of high school. There were
all these things that I thought
had happened that never really
happened. I thought we had
hijacked a number two train
while on acid and taken it up to
the Bronx, but apparently that
was a movie. That was hard to
figure out."
Soviet Russia was an
unforgiving place to grow
up with a Jewish family. But
afterwards, the world was not
kind to a scrawny immigrant kid
who spoke funny and wore too
many furs. Yeshiva grade school
left him unprepared for the
diverse, rigorous environment
of New York City's most
competitive public high school.
The American dream mentality
and materialist ethos that drove
him to Stuyvesant High School
then left him clueless for the
alternative liberal arts scene of
Oberlin College.

One coaching decision cost Greg Ryan

Team. Michigan is glad he's in Ann Arbor.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Out of the spotlight, Ryan builds a powerhouse

Nearly 50,000 fans
watched Greg Ryan
make the decision that
changed his career forever.
In 2007, Ryan - then the U.S.
Women's
National
Team coach
- benched
his starting
goalkeeper
in the
semifinals
of the World {
Cup against ALEJANDRO
Brazil based ZUNIGA
on the
backup's
performance in practice.
The Americans lost, 4-0. The
ensuing scrutiny reached
national levels, and Ryan was
fired soon after the tournament.
The World Cup debacle had
been his only loss in 55 games
with the United States.
On Sunday, as the Michigan
women's soccer coach, Ryan led
the Wolverines into a crucial
game against Ohio State. A little
more than 1,000 fans showed
up. Earlier this season, Ryan had
decided to sit Taylor Bucklin, the
starter on last year's Elite Eight
team, in favor of a freshman,
Megan Hinz.
Michigan battled for a 2-2
draw against the Buckeyes.
Hinz made five saves, including
a couple sprawlingstops, to
ensure the result.
"(The switch to Hinz) worked
out pretty well. It's gone better
than the last one," Ryan said
with a laugh.
A lot has changed since 2007,
when Ryan was leading the
U.S. National Team into the
semifinals and benched Hope
Solo for Briana Scurry.
During his firstyears inAnn
Arbor, a tie against a Big Ten
rival would've been a cause for
celebration. Now, it's somewhat
of a letdown.
But it's not going to cost him

unquestionably in a better place.
Ryan refuses to look back at
the rebuilding process that has
seen the Wolverines become a
powerhouse.
Maybe it's because of what's
in the past: Memories of being
ridiculed for a coaching decision,
losing one game, getting fired
and coming to a Michigan
program without a stadium, and,
as a result, without much ability
to woo recruits.
"I remember thinking,'Oh my
gosh, I don't think we can win
a game,' "Ryan said. "It's just
been a wonderful ride.
"I was thinking about it the
other day, when I was down on
the field. It's so nice to be here
(six) years later."
In the last two seasons under
Ryan, Michigan has reached the
Sweet 16 and Elite Eight. The
Wolverines had a combined 34-9-
4 record. They finished in the top
three of the Big Ten both years.
So after the Wolverines
surrendered a goal in the final
seconds of regulation Sunday
and tied Ohio State, Ryan
managed to crack a smile while
talking to his team.
He won't get fired for the
result. He can keep tinkering
and making adjustments that he
knows will usually work.
"It's likea dream come true,
really," he said. "I don't know
how someone could want more
than that."
It's a dream come true for
Michigan to have acoach who
can make changes that redefine
a program, even if it takes a
couple of tries.
The college game is a little
more forgiving than the national
team. Just the way Ryan likes it.

Twitter @ByAZuniga.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan has guided the women's soccer team from the bottom of the Big Ten to a national power in seven years, and Michigan is thz

his job. Ryan hasn't just tinkered
with position battles; he has
been given the freedom to tool
with the entire program.
So on the sideline Sunday,
Ryan smiled and joked with
his assistants. Seven years ago,
he might've had to listen to
an entire country criticize his
lineup choices, or formation, or
coaching abilities. Now, he gets
to go home and relax with his
postgame snack of chips, salsa
and a Diet Pepsi.
It's not often a move to
Michigan includes a step closer
to anonymity. But Ryan likes
it. At Michigan, he's happy
and comfortable. And he has
produced unmistakably positive
results.
After faltering in the
spotlight, sometimes it's nice to
succeed in the darkness.

Despite temperatures that
barely topped 50, there are three
drummers in the student section
at the Wolverines' game Sunday,
and Ryan can't help but think
how much things have changed.
In 2008, his first season in
Ann Arbor, he paid someone to
pound on a drum to artificially
create some semblance of a
soccer culture.
"We're lucky. I don't have to
show up and drum at my own
games anymore," he said. "We
just wanted to create some
atmosphere at our games. It was
our first attempt. It's alot better
now."
There's new turf and a new
video board at U-M Soccer
Stadium, and there are plans to

expand the facilities further in
coming years.
But in the seasons before the
complex was completed in 2010,
the Wolverines didn't have a
place to call home. They played
games at Eastern Michigan or at
nearby high schools.
It wasn't that long ago that
the facilities and the fans
weren't there. The talent wasn't,
either. In 2008, Michigan
went 4-10-5. Only one person
in Ryan's first recruiting class
stayed all four years.
But Ryan tinkered with
styles and shuffled his coaching
staff. In 2010, he nominated
assistant Dean Duerst as the
new defensive coordinator.
Duerst had never specialized
in defense before, but the odd
move helped Michigan to the
NCAA Tournament. In 2013, the

best unit in program history got
Michigan to the Elite Eight.
"The factcthat what they built
from nothing, because really
there was not much here, and
.now they've built a really stable
foundation," Ryan said. "You
know it's a good culture, you
know it'sgood soccer. It's really
rewarding, and really feels great
to be apartof this program."
To the public eye, Ryan is soft-
spoken and stoic. He doesn't often
berate the referee or yell at his
own players in frustration. If you
were watching a game, it would
be easy not to notice himatall.
But it's hard to ignore the
program's transformation from
a Big Ten bottom dweller to a
perennial contender. It's hard
to ignore the real drummers
at the permanent home venue.
Because of Ryan, the program is

Slippery Rock fans make trek

15,121 people watch
The Rock lose
By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
The population in Slippery
Rock, Pennsylvania is 3,668,
according to the U.S. Census
Bureau. There are now four
traffic lights in the town.
The enrollment at Slippery
Rock University is 7,595. It's a
Division II school that averages
between 7,000 and 9,000 fans at
its football games.
Saturday's attendance for
The Rock's game against
Mercyhurst was 15,121.
The event, by no means the
biggest event in the school's
history, is still the biggest event
the program will play in this
year.
Though fans may not
understand the full connection
between the two schools, or
care that Slippery Rock lost an
important conference game, they
still came for the experience.
Fans filled the sections in the
middle of the stadium even on a
cold and cloudy day. They came
from Western Pennsylvania or
Kalamazoo, Michigan "because
it's U of M," or because they "get
to watch Slippery Rock play."
There's Carly Atwood of
Slippery Rock,who made the four-
hour trek because she remembers
Thursdays in high school.
Declared simply "Michigan
Thursdays," students dressed
in maize and blue or wore their
Michigan apparel. There were
no days dedicated to Ohio State
or Penn State, both a few hours
away. Just Michigan.
Atwood, like some of her
friends at the high school of
approximately 800 students,
had no idea why. But they had
them anyway.
That's because the
connection between Slippery
Rock and Michigan goes back to
1959. The two universities have
been associated with each other

Slippery Rock lost Saturday at the Big House, but the experience was still special to The Rockfans who made the trip.

since Michigan's public address
announcer at the time, Steve
Filipiak, opted to provide the
score when he was struck by the
name of the school.
Since then, The Rock (yes,
that's the mascot) have played
three times at the Big House -
1979, 1981 and Saturday - and
have had their score announced
on the PA system ever since. The
relationship has trickled down
to the town and the high school
- directly across the street.
"At first, we really didn't
know what the connection
was," Jamie Atwood, Carlie's
mother, said. "We always knew
that they cheered for us ... and
then this past year, we started
seeing Michigan people come to
our games."
Atwood came out with her
mother, father and her cousin
for "the experience" and
because her sister, Andi is in

the color guard for The Rock.
In fact, Andi came back for a
fifth year in school, after being
the captain of the color guard,
just so she could perform in
Michigan Stadium.
"We were coming no matter
what," Jamie said. "This is
something we booked on the
calendar."
The Atwoods weren't the only
ones who had the game marked
on their calendar. Heather Rice
and Chris Bonneau both made the
trip to Michigan Stadium.
Rice, a professor at Slippery
Rock,cameouttosupportabout10
of her past and current students.
She has never been to Michigan
Stadium, but Bonneau has. A
graduate of Michigan State, he
came in his Spartan apparel with
Rice, matching Slippery Rock's
green and white colors.
"As soon as we saw they were
playing, we almost immediately

bought tickets," Rice said.
And Mike Barry, a Michigan
season-ticket holder from
Kalamazoo, knew he would be
attending this game, too. He
wore his hat with the same yellow
stripes of the Wolverine helmets.
Barry didn't know the history
between the two schools, either,
only the score from every game.
It was an opportunity to see
the oft talked about program
for himself. He has been to the
Wolverines home games this
season, and Saturday was a
relief from a 3-4 season.
"I'm hoping to see some more
points scored,"he joked."You can
just relax and watch the agame."
And they all waited until
the end, even as Slippery Rock
trailed by 22 points, to soak in
the experience. It's not every
day three times the population
of the town comes to watch its
team play.

THE MICHIGAN
DAILY TOP=10 POLL
Each week, Daily sports staffers fill out ballots, with
first place votes receiving 10 points, second-place
votes receiving nine, and so on.
1. MISSISSIPPI STATE: What a
heartwarming story. A second-tier
public university in America's most
j inbred state is No.1 in something
other than KKK membership rate.
2. FLORIDA STATE: Jimbo Fisher
reminded Jameis Winston about
"Humble Pie" after the Seminoles'
win on Saturday. Is that another
food item he stole from Publix?

3. OLE MISS: Another
heartwarmer from the most racist
state: The school that sings the
Confederate national anthem
before each game is undefeated.
4. ALABAMA: The official state
song of Alabama is cleverly titled
"Alabama." At least they're good at
football.
5. AUBURN: The official state nut
of Alabama is the pecan. We think
that's nuts.
6. OREGON: Apparently the Ducks
like 'em Husky.

7. NOTRE DAME: Four Fighting
Irish players could soon be found
guilty of academic fraud. Hopefully
they learned something Saturday
from America's sweetheart, Jameis.
S8. MICHIGAN STATE: MSU hasn't
beaten Michigan in football at nine
years, assuming you're talking about
student newspapers. The streak
moves to 10 on Friday at 6 p.m.
9. GEORGIA: The Bulldogs' Chubb
worked Arkansas all through the
day, pounding the 'D' over and over
for 202 yards.
10. TEXAS CHRISTIAN: Two
Christian schools in the Top 10?
This whole "Jesus" thing might be
worth checking out, folks.

SLIPPERY ROCK BATTLE AT THE BIG HOUSE
Loss outweighs experience

By MAX COHEN
Daily SportsEditor
It could've been a day to
remember for the rest of their
lives. The matchup that brought
Slippery Rock to Michigan
Stadium for the third time in the
program's history had been years
in the making.
But when the game was
over, The Rock players didn't
care about the atmosphere that
allowed them to play in front
of more than 15,000 fans in the
largest stadium in America. All
that mattered was their team's
45-23 loss to Mercyhurst. For
them, the conference game was
about more than the hoopla.
Quarterback Jared Buck
and linebacker Austin Miele
admitted in their postgame press
conference that the experience
was incredible, but they were
more somber than awestruck,

their eyes downcast. George Mihalik said.
"It was different, but (the field The mood of the opponent

Coaches were taking selfies.
"I don't even know how to do

After the selfie session,
Mercyhurst finished its

task at hand. And it evidently
worked.
Mercyhurst probably gained
more yards than selfies taken,

Michigan for the unique

sting of the loss outweighed the
experience.
Because 109,901 seats can't
