Around 8:12 p.m. Friday, 

the 
Epsilon 
Alpha 
Sigma 

Sorority, is the University of 
Michigan’s first Arab sorority, 
dubbed the Empowered Arab 
Sisterhood, revealed its first 
class of new recruits. The seven 
girls recruited, the “Al-Afdal 
line,” marched into Auditorium 
D in Angell Hall, yelling “We’re 
the girls of Arab countries!” in 
Arabic.

As the girls were revealed, 

a founding member of the 
sorority’s 
chapter 
at 
the 

University 
removed 
a 
pink 

bandana from each girl’s eyes 
and wrapped a flag from their 

country of origin around her 
shoulders. Arab music blared as 
the girls announced themselves 
to the audience.

“I’m number nine, the leader 

of my line, and my name is Maria 
Ulayyet,” one newly initiated 
sister said. “My sisters know 
me as bint al-sham (Daughter of 
Sham-Damascus) and I’m from 
Damascus, Syria, the oldest 
capital in the whole world.”

“My name is Layla Jawad, 

my sisters know me as Amena,” 
another sister said. “I’m from 
Lebanon and I am one of the 
only Arab women in the Ross 
School of Business.”

In honor of World AIDS 

Day, 
the 
National 
Council 

for Negro Women, the Black 
Student Union and Creatives 
of Color presented the HIV 
Monologues Sunday night to 
teach students and faculty about 
the disease that affects millions 
of people around the world. The 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies and the 
University of Michigan Museum 
of Art co-sponsored the event, 
which was held at the Helmut 
Stern Auditorium.

Using spoken-word poetry, 

skits, music and monologues, the 
monologue performers created 
a space to destigmatize those 
afflicted with the disease and 
educate the audience about the 
realities of HIV/AIDS.

The night began with a 

moment of silence to remember 
the millions lost from HIV/
AIDS, followed by a question 
posed to the audience: Why 
should you care? A presentation 
highlighted the current reality 
of HIV/AIDS in the United 
States, which has particularly 
impacted the African-American 
community. In 2015, African 
Americans made up 44 percent 
of all new HIV diagnoses. The 
event then moved into the 
speaker section of the night. 

The first speaker was Nesha 

Haniff, an educator in the 
departments of women’s studies 
and Afroamerican and African 

studies. Haniff’s speech centered 
around low representation of 
women in the discussion of HIV/
AIDS prevention.

“The 
methodologies 

developed for women to prevent 
them from having HIV and STI 
infections are not very well 
developed and they are very, 
very unfriendly,” Haniff said. 
“And so, as a result, women 
become more vulnerable to 
infections like STIs and HIV.”

Haniff explained how the 

only options for women to 
protect their own bodies are to 
use the female condom, which 
can be uncomfortable and very 
noticeable to the partner, or to 
use pre-exposure prophylaxis, 
a drug that is difficult to access.

“A lot of education breaks 

down in practice,” she said. 
“Be conscious of this problem, 
be 
educated 
about 
it, 
and 

advocate for the science that 

are relevant for women’s bodies 
… revolutionize and change the 
science so that we can develop 
safe and important features for 
the new medications that we 
will take.”

The night continued with 

various 
performances 
from 

students and faculty. 

Michigan 
state 
Senate 

Republicans voted to scale 
back minimum wage and paid 
sick leave laws, S.B. 1171 and 
1175 last Wednesday. The bills 
now move to the state House of 
Representatives, while critics 
on the left mobilize to protest 
these and other Republican-
sponsored 
bills 
during 

the lame-duck session.

The 
original 
initiatives, 

which would have raised the 
minimum wage to $12 by 2022, 
were supposed to appear on 
the Nov. 6 ballot. Instead, 
the state Senate adopted the 
proposal in September, which 
many Democrats worried was a 
maneuver to alter the bill after 
the election. Sociology lecturer 
Ian Robinson, president of 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, 
said 
because 

amending a ballot proposal 
would require a three-quarter 
majority 
in 
both 
houses, 

adopting the proposal made it 
easier for Senate Republicans 
to alter the bills.

According 
to 
CNN, 

the 
shooting 
transpired 
at 

Borderline Bar & Grill on Nov. 7 
and left 13, including the gunman 
and a sheriff’s deputy, dead. It was 
“college night” at the Western-
style bar, meaning entry was open 
to anyone over the age of 18 and 
the crowd included many patrons 
from area universities. 

Johnson attended Newbury 

Park High School in Thousand 
Oaks and said she used to go 
to the bar with her friends on 
Wednesdays — the same day of 
the week as the shooting — for 
18-and-over night.

“I was immediately coming

popular German songs; I was 
so affected by them I had to

stare at them to process some

took it off the ballot initiative 
— they could then modify it 
at a later date with a simple 
majority just like any other 
law that’s passed,” Robinson 
said. “So this kind of enabled 
them to do it, then they rushed 
to do it during lame duck 
because this is the last period 
of time they have before Gov. 
Whitmer will take over, and 
she would without a doubt 
veto any efforts to change this 
minimum wage law.”

After the changes, S.B. 

1711 
raises 
the 
minimum 

wage to $12 by 2030 instead 
of 2022. It also raises the 
tipped minimum wage to $4 
instead of merging it with the 
standard $12 minimum wage. 
Because the ballot proposal 
received enough signatures 
to appear on the Nov. 6 ballot, 
Wallace Hopp, a professor of 

business 
and 
engineering, 

said he was taken aback by the 
Senate Republicans’ changes 
to the initiatives.

“I’m 
shocked 
with 
the 

boldness 
with 
which 
the 

legislature 
has 
overturned 

what apparently is the public 
will,” 
Hopp 
said. 
“They 

passed these laws basically to 
prevent them from going on 
the ballot, then immediately 
after the election amended 
them.”

Hopp 
said 
though 

increasing the minimum wage 
would cause some decrease in 
jobs, he thinks the benefits 
from a higher minimum wage 
would more than offset the 
drawbacks.

“The big issue of income 

inequality in which we’ve seen 
the upper tier of the income 
distribution gain hugely over 
the past decade, while the 
bottom has stagnated,” Hopp 
said. “These minimum wage 
increases do bring up the 

bottom of the distribution, 
and so I think we’re losing 
a significant opportunity to 
get more people to a living 
wage in the state of Michigan, 
and what we’re getting in 
return is a very tiny boost in 
employment.”

Maria 
Ibarra-Frayre, 

the Southeastern Michigan 
Regional Organizer for We 
the People Michigan, has 
been educating citizens on 
the lame duck session and the 
bills state Republicans are 
trying to pass. Ibarra-Frayre 
said the legislature’s cuts to 
minimum 
wage 
increases 

will harm working families, 
many of whom have been 
told their source of economic 
difficulties is caused by other 
disadvantaged groups.

“I think this is hurting a 

lot of working families, who 
have 
been 
struggling 
for 

years, who have been fed this 
narrative that the reason why 
they’re struggling is because 

some other marginalized 
community is to blame,” 
Ibarra-Frayre said.

LSA 
junior 

Austin 
McIntosh, 

communications 
chair 

for 
the 
University’s 

chapter of the College 
Republicans, 
said 
he 

does 
not 
think 
the 

government 
should 

mandate how businesses 
pay their employees at 
all.

“I don’t believe in 

the 
minimum 
wage,” 

McIntosh said. “I don’t 
believe 
that 
there’s 

any unfair wage in the 
United States because 
nobody forces you to 
take the job.”

Along 
with 
his 

libertarian 
principles, 

McIntosh also opposes 
a 
minimum 
wage 

increase 
because 

a 
higher 
minimum 

wage 
can 
compel 

employers to hire fewer 
employees and increase 
employment of workers 
with higher skills.

“Another thing is half of 

the people that get minimum 
wage are teenagers or young 
adults 
living 
with 
their 

parents,” 
McIntosh 
said. 

“Historically, when we raise 
the minimum wage, we put 
those people out of work 
because businesses start to 
hire more adults, more older 
people.”

Though Hopp recognizes 

the 
opposition 
by 
some 

business owners to higher 
labor costs, he said now would 
be an opportune time to raise 
the minimum wage.

“I’m sure that big employers 

like it at the margin, it’s less 
costly for sure,” Hopp said. 
“On the other hand, we’ve 
seen 10 years of economic 
growth, we have a very, very 
low unemployment. If we 
were going to do this kind of 
thing, now would have been 
the time to do it.”

After the changes, S.B. 1175 

allows workers to have one 
hour of paid sick leave per 40 
hours of work instead of per 30 
hours of work. Similar to his 
view on minimum wage laws, 
McIntosh does not believe the 
government 
should 
decide 

how many hours of paid 
sick leave businesses should 
provide their employees.

“If a company wants to 

offer sick leave, yeah, why 
not?” McIntosh said. “But I 
don’t think the government 
has to mandate it.”

In addition to benefiting 

the sick employee, Ibarra-
Frayre 
said 
offering 
an 

adequate 
amount 
of 
paid 

sick leave hours is essential 
to 
maintaining 
healthy 

workplaces.

“In reality, who wants to 

have a sick employee come 
to their place of work and 
then get everyone else sick?” 
Ibarra-Frayre said. “If you 
working at a restaurant and 
you’re there, that’s a liability 
for everyone which can be so

As a senior entering my last 
semester of undergrad, I’ve taken 
a lot of time to reflect on what 
experiences of mine have been the 
most memorable these past four 
years. Close to the top of my list 
has been my job since freshman 
year at the Conference and Event 
Services of the University Unions. 
It helped me discover one of my 
most important spaces on campus, 
one that many students pass by 
every day without a second thought. 
As both a student staff member 
and 
student 
representative 
to 
the Michigan League Board of 
Governors, the Michigan League is 
a place I consider a home.
Tucked 
among 
the 
many 
historical relics and steeped in the 
building’s history of the first space 
for women on the University of 
Michigan’s campus is the Blagdon 
Room — one of my favorites for its 
antique feel and beautiful stained 
glass windows. Another reason I 
feel so at peace in this room is the 
room’s historical purpose as a non-

denominational 
religious 
space. 
Among the stained glass windows 
are depictions of many world 
religions — including symbols such 
as the Star of David and the 
Christian Cross. A prominent figure 
at the League shared a powerful 
quote with me from the original 
architects of the building. Irving 
and Allen Pond noted: “The room is 
to appeal to individuals of all shades 
of belief, or non-belief; to anyone 
who 
desired 
in 
contemplative 
spirit, touched with humility, to 
place herself in harmony with the 
universe.”
It is with the Blagdon Room’s 
original purpose and meaning 
in mind that I take offense to a 
request to University President 
Mark Schlissel, made by a group 
of students in early November, to 
remove one of my religion’s most 
sacred symbols – which has since 
the 1920s occupied a pane on one of 
the stained glass windows.
As a Hindu, the Swastik (S-vas-
thik) or Swastika (S-vas-thik-a) 
is very important to me. This 
clockwise rotated cross with four 
dots in each quadrant is an essential 

sign of Hinduism. Celebrations and 
prayers are incomplete without the 
Swastik. It symbolizes the sun and 
is an auspicious symbol used as a 
good luck charm in many aspects of 
Hindu life. In my house, a Swastik 
along with a symbol that resembles 
the number 3 called Om or Aum – 
they’re also frequently seen on the 
sides of yoga studios and interfaith 
bumper stickers. These symbols 
greet visitors as a way of welcoming 
them into our home and are used 
to prevent negative energy and evil 
from entering my family’s space.
Historically, 
Om 
and 
the 
Swastika have been held as equally 
important spiritual relics necessary 
to mark occasions of happiness 
and allow for the influx of positive 
energy wherever they are placed. 
While the Om symbol is commonly 
tattooed on non-Hindus, viewed as 
a sign of peace and even a symbol 
of hippie culture, my family and 
other Hindus have been forced to 
decrease our use of the Swastik sign 
and feel ashamed and embarrassed 
by it because the symbol was 
culturally appropriated in the 1930s.
This symbol belongs to my 

people, but I’ve faced questions 
about its relation to Nazism my 
entire life. It’s important the general 
population knows the symbols have 
no relation to one another. The Nazi 
swastika (swas-tik-a) is black and 
turned on a 45-degree angle. This is 
different from the Hindu Swastika 
that is not turned on an angle and 
is typically made out of gold or is 
colored red. The Nazi swastika has 
been in use since the 1930s while 
the Hindu Swastika use has been 
documented as early as 500 B.C.!! 
However, like many other elements 
of Indian culture, the Swastik was 
stolen by white supremacists to 
erase our existence and culture and 
replace it with their own ideology.
My job on the Michigan League 
Board of Governors is to serve as an 
adviser to the director of the League 
and promote the heritage of the 
building. With this responsibility 
in mind, I think it would be a great 
shame to remove the window. 
While I understand the pain and 
violence that has been perpetuated 
under similar symbols, I urge 
University leadership to stop the 
stigmatization of the Hindu symbol 

by keeping the pane up alongside 
labels with explanations of all the 
religious symbols in the Blagdon 
Room and the significance of the 
room as a whole. It’s important that 
students on this campus understand 
the symbol has a huge cultural 
significance and positive meaning 

that represents a good proportion 
of students on this campus. It is not 
fair to those like myself that hold 
this symbol sacred to have it stolen 
away from us once again. Let us be 
represented on this campus and 
have it be an educational experience 
for all others.

This summer, LSA senior 
Zainab Bhindarwala interned 
at a congresswoman’s office 
and an advocacy-based legal 
nonprofit.
How did you hear about 
your internships?
I found both of my internships 
on Handshake. However, after 
submitting my application to 
the congresswoman’s office, 
I didn’t hear from them for a 
few weeks. I decided to “bump” 
my email in their inbox, and 
the 
internship 
coordinator 
replied to my follow-up saying 
he “likes my style” and wants 
to set up an interview. Lesson 
learned: If you know you want 
an internship, don’t be afraid 
to let them know you’re still 
interested! 
Finding 
interns 
isn’t every organization’s first 
priority, so if you don’t bug 
them about your application, 
you could lose a really great 
opportunity.
What made you want to 
apply?
I knew I wanted to have 
a 
meaningful 
internship 
experience this summer, but I 
didn’t want to go back to D.C. 
My motivation behind applying 
for the internship with the 
Congresswoman was to have 
a more “political” experience. 
I had a little bit of exposure to 
nonprofits already and I knew 
I needed to learn more about 
different 
sectors, 
especially 
since I want to be employed a 
year from now. My motivation 
for applying to the nonprofit 
was because I thought it was the 
perfect type of organization for 
me to work in post-graduation. I 
didn’t realize it when I applied, 
but their Michigan office is 
actually in my hometown and 
the congresswoman’s district 
office wasn’t too far away 
either, so it was easy for me to 
do both internships.
What are your favorite 

memories 
from 
your 
experience?
I didn’t intend on having 
two internships this summer 
– I really just wanted one. 
However, after accepting the 
position at the nonprofit, I was 
told they only wanted interns 
to come in two days a week. A 
couple days later I got a call from 
the congresswoman’s office and 
it seemed like fate for my top 
two internships to line up so 
perfectly. I worked three days 
a week at the congresswoman’s 

district office, and two days a 
week at the nonprofit. I even 
got a scholarship from U of 
M for my internship with the 
congresswoman, 
so 
things 
ended up working out pretty 
well.
My favorite memory from my 
summer internships is probably 
the connections I made with the 
other interns. This summer, the 
congresswoman had 14 interns! 
There were so many of us in the 
office and at times it got a little 
crowded, but I loved getting to 
know everyone and learning 
about what brought each of us 
there and where we intended 
to go in the future. We were all 
at different stages in our lives 
– some of us were in college, 
one intern was in law school 
and some were in high school! 
I loved talking to the younger 
interns 
about 
my 
college 
experiences, and offering a 
little bit of mentorship on what 
college is like.
What is the culture like 

where you interned?
The office culture at both 
of my internships was pretty 
laid-back. 
I 
expected 
the 
congresswoman’s office to be 
much more strict, but since 
it was a district office and 
the congresswoman was in 
D.C. most of the time anyway, 
people were pretty relaxed and 
interns were given plenty of 
time to get to know each other 
and collaborate on projects. 
It 
wasn’t 
the 
competitive 
and 
networking-oriented 
environment that I experienced 
in D.C., and it was a nice change.
The culture at the nonprofit 
was a huge surprise. It was 
perhaps even more laid-back 
than at the congresswoman’s 
office, and yet I was still always 
sitting on the edge of my seat. 
I realized that some of the 
elitist culture in social justice 
spaces on college campuses still 
remains in the workforce. The 
nonprofit does incredible work, 
and that’s what made me want 
to intern there in the first place, 
but 
the 
behind-the-scenes 
intern experience was a little 
different than what they posted 
on social media.
Any advice for prospective 
interns interested in public 
service?
When 
you’re 
working 
in 
an 
unpaid 
internship, 
it’s 
important to remember that 
while you want to maintain 
a professional attitude, you 
don’t owe the organization 
anything more than that. If 
you’re being asked to do work 
that’s outside of the internship 
that you applied for, speak 
up. If you are unhappy with 
the way you are being treated 
or 
uncomfortable 
with 
the 
workplace environment, bring 
up your concerns with your 
supervisor. 
If 
they 
aren’t 
responsive, then know that 
you don’t owe them your time. 
They aren’t paying you, and if 
interning there is doing you 
more harm than good, you 
shouldn’t feel obligated to stay.

Public Policy senior Ashley 
Tjhung 
interned 
at 
Vital 
Voices Global Partnership, a 
global women’s empowerment 
organization, in Washington, 
D.C. last summer. While in D.C., 
she was also a Public Service 
Scholar 
at 
the 
Conference 
on 
Asian 
Pacific 
American 
Leadership, 
a 
nonprofit 
organization 
dedicated 
to 
creating a pipeline of Asian 
American, Native Hawaiians 
and Pacific Islanders in public 
service. As a CAPAL scholar, she 
received a $3,000 scholarship, 
professional 
development 
opportunities and completed a 

Community Action Project with 
members of her cohort.
How did you hear about 
your internship?
I found a posting for Vital 
Voices on the University of 
Michigan 
Handshake 
site. 
Handshake is … a lot and it can 
be easy to be overwhelmed by 
all the postings. However, I 
found it useful to find positions 
at 
organizations 
I 
wasn’t 
aware of before searching. For 
CAPAL, I was referred by the 
lovely Areeba Haider (former 
MiC senior editor). She had 
previously also been a CAPAL 
scholar and recommended the 
program as a great way for 
AANHPIs to afford to work at 
an unpaid internship.
What made you want to 
apply?

As a public policy major, I 
knew I wanted to be in D.C. for 
the summer, but wasn’t sure 
what I wanted to do. I applied 
to Vital Voices on a whim and 
luckily, I got it! For CAPAL, I 
knew I needed to find funding to 
afford D.C. and unfortunately, 
the Ford School does not offer 
great 
internship 
funds 
for 
undergrads. I also was interested 
in learning more about what 
issues and organizing AANHPIs 
were doing in D.C. and thought 
CAPAL would be a great way to 
meet peers and mentors.
What are your favorite 
memories 
from 
your 
experience?
During my internship, Sophie 
Otiende, one of the women in 
the Vital Voices network, came 
to speak with the staff members. 

She heads an organization that 
advocates against the trafficking 
of women and girls in Kenya. 
One of their initiatives included 
training journalists about how 
to report on trafficking and to 
empower survivors to claim 
their 
narratives. 
While 
the 
program functions in a different 
context, it was amazing to hear 
how similar the principles of 
that program are to Michigan 
in Color. Her parting wisdom to 
us was that women, particularly 
women of color, need to write 
ourselves into history, because 
if we don’t, no one will. It is 
my hope that Michigan in 
Color is one of those platforms 
that ensures women of color’s 
contributions are not forgotten.
What is the culture like 
where you interned?

As an intern, I appreciated 
the work culture at Vital Voices. 
The people that work there are 
incredibly passionate about the 
work that they were doing and 
that showed. Furthermore, the 
staff were highly conscious of 
trying to make the internship 
experience valuable for us. We 
had brown bags every week 
with different members of the 
staff to learn more about their 
jobs, how they got there and also 
some professional development 
opportunities.
I was also impressed by the 
culture at CAPAL. They had 
a great mentorship program 
where I met truly amazing 
AANHPIs who wanted to help 
others succeed. Furthermore, 
I loved my cohort and our 
program lead!

Any advice for prospective 
interns interested in public 
service?
The D.C. public service field 
is highly competitive. It was 
often hard for me to feel like 
I had a place there, especially 
as an Asian American. Luckily, 
through CAPAL, I met so 
many AANHPI mentors and 
peers who helped me figure 
out what I want to do in public 
service and were willing to 
make my next steps easier. 
Networking can feel really icky 
at first, but focus on making 
real connections with people 
instead of angling for a job 
posting. I really recommend 
getting involved in an affinity 
organization like CAPAL which 
makes finding mentors much 
easier.

Being an intern in Washington, D.C. as an Asian American

ASHLEY TJHUNG
Managing MiC Editor

Controversy in the League: Reclaiming our Swastik

RIYA KUMAR
MiC Contributor

Here’s 
the 
thing 
about 
identities and labels: in some 
instances, they’re placed upon 
your shoulders even if you have 
a hard time relating to them. 
It’s not anyone’s fault; it’s just 
how society works nowadays. 
When you remotely resemble or 
align with a certain group, that 
label and identity is painted 
bright red on your forehead 
because the idea of a “middle 
ground” (of being a hybrid of 
sorts, a melting pot of different 
identities 
that 
combine 
to 
form another different and 
unique one) is still not entirely 
accepted as an actual identity.
Let me explain a little more. 
The other day, I was studying in 
the aptly labeled “Sky Lounge” 
of my apartment building. I 
have a pair of noise-canceling 
headphones I like to wear while 
I work, so I can focus better 
and 
drown 
out 
unwanted 
distractions. 
Unfortunately, 
after wearing them for a while 
they start hurting my ears, so I 
take them off from time to time. 
During one of these breaks, 
I 
accidentally 
overheard 
a 
conversation 
between 
two 
girls a few feet away from me. 
One of the girls was talking 
about how, even though her 
entire 
family 
is 
from 
the 
Philippines, she doesn’t feel 
comfortable 
identifying 
as 
such. She’s lived her entire 
life in the United States, only 
speaks English, never visited 
the Philippines and her parents 
never taught her about the 
culture. In essence, she just 
feels American, but everyone 
calls her Filipino because of her 
roots and because of her looks. 
Is that right? Is that wrong? 
Should she accept she’s both or 
that she’s only one?
It’s a very complicated topic 

that hasn’t been discussed as 
much as it should. I don’t think 
I know what the correct answer 
is, but I do understand where 
she’s coming from, in a way, 
because I feel the same.
At 
first 
glance, 
I 
look 
American. 
I’ve 
got 
white, 
slightly tanned skin, and I 
speak English perfectly. Back 
home people confuse me for 
a “gringa” (Spanish slang for 
mainland American) all the 
time. 

And I hate it, completely 
despise it. It irritates me to no 
end having to say, “No, no, I’m 
Puerto Rican, not American,” 
which is kind of absurd because 
in reality I’m both. Puerto Rico 
is a colony of the United States; 
I have an American passport; 
I am American, right? But I’m 
an American who was born in 
Puerto Rico. 
So why the discomfort? Why 
shouldn’t I just accept it?
Because, unlike the girl I 
mentioned above, I grew up and 
still live in Puerto Rico. My first 
language is Spanish; my music 
is reguetón, salsa y merengue; 
my sport is soccer, not football; 
my national anthem is “La 
Borinqueña”; and my flag has 
one 
single, 
bright, 
shining 

star in it. Because I grew up 
in a place that many mainland 
Americans are unaware of — 
that many don’t even realize 
is actually national, and not 
classified 
as 
international. 
Because I’ve been asked if I 
need sponsorship for a work 
visa, if I have a student visa; 
because, even though it has a 
spot in Congress, Puerto Rico 
doesn’t have a voice or a vote. 
Because I saw how the United 
States treated Puerto Rico after 
hurricanes Maria and Irma; 
because I witnessed how the 
media failed to account for 
the actual death toll of the 
hurricanes until a year after the 
disaster; how they completely 
stopped reporting on the state 
of the island a little less than 
a week after the storms had 
struck; 
how 
the 
president 
of the United States (and of 
Puerto Rico — it’s a colony of 
the United States, therefore 
under 
the 
same 
governing 
body) threw paper towels in 
an absurd attempt to aid the 
islanders after the disasters.
Why should I feel American 
if all that I have witnessed 
recently and for my entire life is 
how terribly the United States 
has treated Puerto Rico?
Are my feelings right? Are 
they unjustifiable? Are they 
wrong?
I’m not going to pretend 
that I know what the correct 
answer is because I honestly 
don’t. I just hope that you 
finish reading this and are 
willing to speak up more on the 
idea surrounding the identities 
people are born into and the 
ones they align with, because 
in some cases, they’re different. 
Given all the conversations and 
discussions that have surfaced 
in the past two years or so 
around the topic of immigrants 
and immigration, it should be 
taken into consideration.

SADHANA RAMASESHADRI/Daily

I realized that some 
of the elitist culture 
in social justice 
spaces on college 
campuses remains in 
the workforce


W 

e 
all 
know 
that 
feeling. You decide 
you have some extra 
time on your hands and you 
immediately 
reach 
for 
your 
phone. And though you originally 
intended to only watch the 
highlights of yesterday’s football 
game, 45 minutes later you end up 
in the “weird” parts of YouTube, 
taking in videos you never meant 
to watch. For many, this might 
mean something along the lines 
of “Dave Rubin Calmly Destroys 
a Crazed Hyper-Victim,” a video 
that has racked up more than 10 
million views on YouTube. For 
some reason it seems more and 
more difficult to find an inner 
satisfaction from watching such 
content.
This particular phenomenon of 
sorts has led to an unmistakable 
rise in conservatism on YouTube. 
Led by polemicists, comedians 
and thinkers such as Ben Shapiro, 
Steven Crowder and Michael 
J. Knowles, this conservative 
wave has surprisingly stained 
the backend of YouTube red. 
Channels such as PragerU (1.8 
million YouTube subscribers), 
Steven Crowder (over 3 million 
subscribers) and The Daily Wire 
(over 1 million subscribers) serve 
as a testament to this growth. 
That’s not to mention individual 
videos such as “Ben Shapiro 
DESTROYS 
Transgenderism 
and Pro-Abortion Arguments” 
and 
“FEMINIST 
& 
SJW 
OWNED COMPILATION 2017 
#2 (Destroyed Edition)” raking 
up 3.9 million and 4.4 million 
views respectively. And these 
channels are growing too. Stats 
show Steven Crowder’s channel 
has increased its monthly views 
from 2.2 million in January 2016 
to over 40 million today. 
We’re seeing this increasingly 
conservative 
wave 
in 
the 
millennial population, of which, 
according to a study by the Case 
Foundation, more than 50 percent 
of millenial constituents identify 
as conservative, compared with 
43 percent identifying as liberal, 
a marked difference from years 
past. Could it be that YouTube 
accounts for some of this trend? 

First of all, much of the appeal 
of conservatism on YouTube 
stems from the picture that most 
conservatives paint of the left. 
The left is always portrayed as 
intolerant and fragile (i.e., calling 
them snowflakes). We see that all 
the time with videos focusing on 
so-called social justice warriors 
who appear entitled and act 
increasingly on emotion rather 
than a logical basis. There are 
obviously very intelligent people 

on the left, but by focusing on 
these 
extremes, 
conservative 
thinkers are capable of easily 
exploiting gaps in logic and 
advancing their viewpoint.
Possibly more effective is the 
portrayal of conservative ideology 
as a university-styled collection 
of courses. This is seen with the 
popularity of Prager University 
and 
its 
five-minute-long 
educational videos. The website 
literally portrays the “university” 
as a way “to get smarter”, 
boasting over 1.7 million views. 
Regardless, its tidbits have 
become hugely popular and 
have been quietly influencing 
people with easily digestible 
facts. Takes against feminism 
and the gender wage gap, and 
for gun rights and school choice 
are largely prevalent among 
its collection and have been 
very successful in attracting 
attention 
and 
viewership. 
These 
conservatives 
are 
generally smart people. Heck, 
Shapiro is a University of 
California, Los Angeles and 
Harvard Law School graduate. 
Dinesh D’Souza is a Dartmouth 
University alum. To all these 
people wondering why a lot 

of these conservatives’ bases 
are increasingly uneducated, 
it’s because of the credibility 
these conservatives draw to 
their names. It’s very easy for 
someone to say, “Hey, well I 
don’t know. But that guy went 
to Harvard Law so he must be 
right.” The irony of this lies 
in the fact that most of these 
right-wing 
thinkers 
actually 
advocate against this line of 
thought. They constantly push 
for individuality in thinking; 
Shapiro 
has 
repeatedly 
denounced the argument that 
a call for one’s credibility 
or 
experience 
automatically 
justifies one’s thinking as fact. 
But nevertheless, much of the 
populace still seemingly falls 
for this trap.
That’s not to mention that 
most of these speakers are 
also just simply great debaters. 
They know when and where 
to call out logical fallacies and 
moments of ad hominem, and 
are capable of staying true 
to one single premise. When 
people like these go up against 
everyday students, it’s very 
easy for them to seem like 
they have the more intelligent 
and rational way of thought. 
And perhaps it is simply this 
approach — of presenting such 
views through debate — that 
makes it easier to bring people 
over to their side. Rather 
than just lecture on ideology 
and why it is good policy, 
showing through debate that 
it is seemingly better than the 
other perspective is perhaps 
more potent as a persuasive 
technique.
 If those on the left want to 
turn around YouTube’s red 
wave, the only way would be 
to showcase why their ideas 
are superior. People like Cenk 
Uygur and The Young Turks 
have 
started 
this 
counter-
movement. It just hasn’t grown 
to the level of influence that the 
right has seemingly developed.

A

ny mention of universal social 
programs inevitably devolves 
into 
discussion 
of 
their 
exorbitant cost and the undesirability 
of making programs available to 
people who don’t need them. 
In 2015, former State Secretary 
Hillary 
Clinton 
somewhat 
notoriously said, “Now, I’m a 
little different from those who 
say free college for everybody. 
I am not in favor of making 
college free for Donald Trump’s 
kids.” This phrasing has become 
the central argument against 
universal programs by liberals: 
Why would the left want to 
extend taxpayer funded college, 
health care, family leave or 
debt relief to “Donald Trump’s 
kids”—that is, the wealthy?
Many articles and columns 
on the topic seem to miss 
the 
overall 
point 
behind 
universal programs, choosing 
to evaluate them on purely 
economic grounds. Overall, a 
means tested debt-free college 
program like Clinton suggested 
would be more cost effective, 
and wouldn’t waste resources 
on people who are generally 
capable of shouldering their 
burdens alone. The reason left 
wing politicians advocate big 
programs, though, is because 
they’re simple to understand 
and usually quite popular.
Take 
Obamacare, 
for 
example. 
After 
its 
passage, 
most 
people 
will 
still 
get 
health insurance through their 
employers, but not everyone 
— thus, you can buy your own 
plan from the private market 
on a public exchange. There’s 
an individual mandate, so you’ll 
pay an extra tax come April if 
you fail to sign up for coverage. 
Not everyone can afford these 
new plans, though, even with 
the price reducing measures, 
so you can request subsidies 
through a separate process. 
Additionally, if you’re under 
26, you can use your parents’ 
insurance — as long as they have 
a plan that qualifies under the 
new standard, though.
Contrast this with Medicare 

for 
All 
system. 
 
Everyone 
knows what Medicare is — 
health insurance — and most 
people who use it are satisfied. 
Maybe this is bad for public 
discourse: Bulky means-tested 
bills like Obamacare are either 
incomprehensible or can be 
ripped 
apart, 
despite 
their 
potential advantages. Maybe we 
lose something important when 
a large portion of Americans 
choose not to spend their free 
time poring over the latest news 
from Capitol Hill, but that’s the 
reality we’re faced with.

Furthermore, the fundamental 
desire 
behind 
Obamacare 
and Medicare for All are the 
same: 
People 
want 
health 
care, and they want it to be 
affordable. When columnists 
and 
commentators 
lament 
the ignorance of the public 
(or Millennials, or liberals, 
or 
conservatives) 
they’re 
pretending people actually care 
about the individual facets of 
a bill rather than its overall 
effect. Where’s the utility in 
reminding people that some 
specific manifestation of their 
demand is impractical?
Maybe it’s useful as a way to 
combat the surface-level appeal 
of big, expensive policies — 
people support Medicare for 
All, but telling them it could 
cost upwards of $30 trillion for 
America in federal spending, 
might dampen that enthusiasm. 
Matt Bruenig or other Medicare-
for-All proponents will dispute 
the idea that such an expensive 
program 
isn’t 
as 
expensive 
as the status quo; around and 
around it goes. For most people, 
though, this sort of thing isn’t 
useful. Economic models and 

“viability” 
estimates 
(i.e., 
the likelihood of legislation 
passing) are only useful as ways 
to validate preexisting political 
inclinations.
Obviously, most people would 
tell you that they form their 
beliefs only after researching 
in great detail — some of them 
might actually do the research, 
combing through newspapers 
and academic journals for the 
best possible options. Be that 
as it may, these people are rare 
— and despite their efforts, 
they’re likely to find their 
preexisting ideology the most 
factually 
viable. 
Politicians 
— especially those on the left 
— use big policies to overcome 
this. Untangling support for 
the moral argument “everyone 
deserves health care” using 
economics is a lot more difficult 
than building that belief in the 
first place.
Given this, I find it mystifying 
when national columnists use 
their platform to argue against 
the little details of policy, 
like David Leonhardt’s recent 
argument 
against 
universal 
student debt forgiveness. Yes, 
upper 
middle-class 
students 
have a lot of debt (and don’t 
really need help paying it off). 
The reason debt forgiveness is 
popular, though, was never its 
economic efficiency.
It’s easy to say people should 
just pay more attention to the 
news, instead of responding to 
easily digestible policy slogans 
(“Medicare for All,” “universally 
free college,” “cancel student 
debt”) but admonishing the 
public is worse than useless — 
it actively makes people dislike 
you. Anyone with a platform 
who’s inclined to argue against 
broad, undiscerning programs 
should focus on why people 
want them in the first place, 
instead of the minutiae of 
individual proposals.

The appeal of universal programs

Climate change, like many 
other 
policy 
points, 
has 
unnecessarily become a partisan 
issue. The national assessment 
was released just one month after 
a report requested by the United 
Nations, both of which explain 
how a likely temperature rise of 
1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 
years will result in severe damage 
to coastal livelihoods, industries 
and ecosystems. Global warming, 
an issue that concerns more than 
one political party and more than 
one country, poses a vital question: 
How do we protect scientific data 
from political influence?
The 
National 
Climate 
Assessment 
fulfills 
a 
1990 
congressional 
mandate 
that 
promoted research toward our 
understanding 
and 
inevitable 
response 
to 
climate 
change. 
The assessment warns that as 
a country, we’ll need to either 
mitigate or adapt to environmental 
changes, as rising temperatures 
will impede economic growth 
and extensively harm American 
infrastructure, agriculture and 
energy production.
Money seemingly goes where 
policy tells it to, and policy does 
what the administration says. 
Trump reportedly does not call 
himself a believer of climate 
change, 
which, 
politically 
speaking, means it deserves no 
place in his national budget. If 
money isn’t going toward cleaning 
up the environment, then it goes 
other places, like the $210 million 
already spent sending troops to 
the U.S.-Mexico border. According 
to the U.N., if the same emphasis 
were placed on efforts toward 
reducing 
carbon 
emissions, 
further warming in the next few 
decades would likely be less than 
0.5 degrees Celsius. Trump’s lack 
of policy implementation does not 
interfere with individual actions 
recommended by the U.S. and 
U.N. reports.
As long as climate change is a 
partisan issue, the future of our 
planet will remain in the hands 
of whoever is elected president. 
Yet, our climate belongs to each 
of us individually and does not 
discriminate 
on 
partisanship. 

The New York Times reports the 
most recent election obstructs 
efforts toward carbon taxes and 
national budget proposals, but 
recognizes the divisive nature of 
climate partisanship is faltering. 
In southern Florida, where rising 
sea levels are causing considerable 

damage, a Republican lost his seat 
to a Democrat for not going far 
enough on environmental issues. 
Both 
policy-based 
and 
individual actions are necessary 
to mitigate the disastrous effects 
of climate change. Just as we 
should take steps to promote 
sustainability and environmental 
health in our everyday lives, we 
should also advocate for policy 
measures and representatives that 
prioritize comprehensive climate 
policy 
grounded 
in 
science, 
evidence and facts. 
It is clear the effects of 
climate change are here. While 
hurricanes and forest fires are 
natural phenomena, Camp Fire 
and Hurricanes Maria, Michael 
and Florence were so destructive 
because of climate change. The 
ways in which climate change 
and sustainably-oriented climate 
policy have been co-opted by 
partisan groups minimizes the 
gravity of the crisis we face. 
Climate change should not be a 
partisan issue; its effects surely 
won’t be. At the end of the day, 
worsening 
natural 
disasters 
will uproot, displace, and harm 
Republicans and Democrats alike.
In the face of ignorance and 
apathy from the Oval Office and 
other offices, we must continue to 
act. There are plenty of individual 
ways 
to 
make 
a 
difference: 
take 
advantage 
of 
public 

transportation, 
eat 
less 
meat 
compose, and of course reduce, 
reuse, recycle. Identify those 
politicians who deny climate 
change, reject science-based fact 
and sell out to corporate interest 
groups. Hold accountable all those 
who continue to mortgage the 
future of our planet and our health 
in favor of quarterly reports and 
bottom lines. In name and action, 
be an environmentalist! It is in 
your best interest and in the best 
interest of those you love.
It is easy to listen to today’s 
environmental 
discourse 
and 
become 
disheartened 
and 
discouraged; there is still so much 
to be done. Climate change will 
affect all of us — it is time we start 
acting like it.
Being an environmentalist can 
no longer be a choice. If we want to 
ensure a safe future everyone must 
fully embrace what it means to be 
an environmentalist and realize 
that identity through our actions. 
We’re a nascent population that is 
going to have to deal with the real-
world consequences of climate 
change, so be cognizant when 
making real world decisions. 
But this isn’t just about recycling 
boxes. Soon, we’ll all earn salaries 
as we go out into the workforce 
and we’ll be faced with many 
important decisions like what 
car to buy, where to work and 
what companies to invest in. The 
point is, the choices you make are 
important, and should be made 
with environmental protection in 
mind.
Climate change is a monumental 
challenge, it may not seem like 
one individual can create change, 
but if every individual promoted 
environmentalist ideals in their 
actions, we would soon see a ripple 
effect of change. Your contribution 
isn’t futile; coupled with thousands, 
even millions of other individuals, 
your everyday contributions will 
make a difference. Despite an 
administration that readily rejects 
climate change and obstructs 
climate policy, it is our duty, as 
environmentalists, and it all starts 
with your decisions. So what will 
you do tomorrow?

FROM THE DAILY

What will you do?

C

limate change will have incredibly damaging effects if we don’t 
take action against it, and soon. A new federal report released last 
week contradicts President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on climate 
change and emphasizes the economic downfalls it will cause our country 
in the near future. A focus on Trump’s denial, while important, ultimately 
distracts from the urgency of the issue, irresponsibly turning an effort to 
highlight the truth into political ammunition that fuels partisanship.

The choices you 
make should 
be made with 
environmental 
protection in

Where’s the utility 
in reminding people 
that their demand is 
impractical?

Leave it to the Italians to 

produce some of the kitschiest 
yet, dare I say it, classiest pop 
music ever made. In my opinion, 
music in general peaked in the era 
of new wave, whose Anglophone 
faces such as Elvis Costello and 
the Talking Heads were brilliant, 
but overshadowed by an Italian 
named Franco Battiato.

Battiato’s 1981 album La Voce 

del Padrone was a return to pop 
for the artist who had been 
on an experimental streak for 
nearly a decade. Thankfully, it 
was a return to his strengths, 
including an innate genius when 
it comes to creating hooks and 
an infectious playfulness similar 
to that of the aforementioned 
Costello 
and 
Talking 
Heads 

frontman David Byrne. It departs 
from much of the popular music 
of the previous decades in Italy, 
which (although a guilty pleasure 
of mine) exhausted all the 
frontiers of crooners singing over 
overtly melodramatic orchestral 
accompaniments. La Voce del 
Padrone is not the familiar 

collection of sappy love songs, but 
one filled with a healthy dose of 
equal parts irony and whimsy.

“Bandiera Bianca” (“White 

Flag”), the album’s most popular 
track, is a dizzying mix of 
references and a healthy dose 

of cynicism. He starts off by 
referencing Bob Dylan before 
transitioning 
to 
old 
Italian 

poetry 
and 
even 
German 

philosopher Theodor Adorno. 
Battiato’s voice is nowhere near 
conventionally pleasing. It lacks 
both technical quality and the 
rough edge and expressiveness 
of most of the genre’s singers. 
Instead, it is rather wavery and 

nasal, yet it somehow works 
with its earnestness and self-
assuredness.

Battiato’s 
unconventional 

voice is a perfect accompaniment 
to the synth-heavy, but simple 
instrumentation. 
However, 

tracks like “Gli Uccelli” also 
feature 
gorgeous 
orchestral 

backings. Battiato often double 
tracks his own vocals, which 
offsets his limitations rather well.

Other standout tracks include 

“Centro di Gravità Permanente” 
and “Cuccurucucù.” The latter is 
inspired by a Mexican standard 
that has been covered by artists 
for decades including Joan Baez 
and Caetano Veloso. He uses the 
refrain, but fills his verses with 
The Beatles and The Rolling 
Stones references from “With A 
Little Help From My Friends” 
to “Ruby Tuesday.” Hell, it even 
takes from the Iliad.

La Voce Del Padrone could be 

every poptimist’s first and last 
piece of evidence to convince 
the naysayers that pop can be 
as innovative and unique as any 
form of music out there. Running 
at just over half an hour, it is an 
easy, impecably produced and 
ridiculously fun listen.

Franco Battiato is an 
overshadowed pop hero

DAILY WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

There’s nothing the newest 

iteration of “Robin Hood” — a 
film which dares to ask, “What 
if England’s most enduring folk 
hero was one Four Loko short of 
a dudebro?” — hates more than 
Robin 
Hood 
(Taron 
Egerton, 

“Billionaire Boys Club”) himself, 

or rather, the preconceived idea of 
Robin Hood you’ve been carrying 
around with you since the fox-
starring Disney film introduced 
you to the character. Everything 
about this film is geared to impress 
one idea upon you: This is not your 
father’s Robin Hood. The opening 
narration all but says that out loud 
in between groanworthy clichés 
like, “Forget everything you know.”

This is a Robin Hood who 

doesn’t go by Robin Hood until 
the very end of the movie, more a 
superhero than a common thief. It’s 
a Robin Hood who uses a bow and 
arrow like John Wick uses a pistol, 
who seduces Marian — not a maid 
in this version, but a thief played 
by Eve Hewson (“Bridge of Spies”) 
— by the end of their first scene 
together and banters with Jamie 
Foxx (“Baby Driver”) like the two 
have known each other for years 
instead of days. This Robin Hood 

is basically Batman, and that might 
have been cool if everything about 
the film didn’t speak to a complete 
uninterest in telling the story at 
hand.

From beginning to end, it’s clear 

the last thing “Robin Hood” wants 
to be is a Robin Hood movie set 
in medieval England. During an 
early Crusade sequence, in which 
arrows fly with the speed, strength 
and frequency of a bullet fired 
from an assault rifle, it’s clear it 
wants to be a war movie set in the 
contemporary Middle East. The 
Nottingham set design features the 
kind of massive industrial mines 
and inexplicable jets of fire and 
showers of sparks that recall bad 
steampunk movies. During the 
hand-to-hand scenes, it somewhat 
resembles an “Arkham” game, with 
free-flowing combat that could 
have worked if it weren’t cut to the 
point of incomprehensibility and 
shot in sludgy slow-motion that 
Zack Snyder would call “a little 
much.”

Yet for all the hoods it wears, the 

one thing “Robin Hood” never feels 
like is a Robin Hood movie. Sure, 
Taron Egerton might be playing a 
character named Robin, but it’s just 
his character from “Kingsman” 
awkwardly crowbarred into a 
12th-century story. The problem 
isn’t just that it doesn’t in any 
way resemble the legend, though 
— if the finished product was in 
any way acceptable, it may have 
offered an opportunity for growth 
in how stories about the character 
are told — it’s that, apart from the 
performances by Foxx and Ben 
Mendelson (“Ready Player One”), 
the creative decisions made were 
the wrong ones regardless of the 

title character.

On top of the unintelligible 

editing 
and 
nonsensical 
set 

design, the film is simply ugly on 
every level. The costumes are so 
noticeably awful that the best that 
can be said about them is that none 
of the armor features nipples. The 
cinematography fares no better, 
with one shot during a dialogue 
scene bafflingly focusing on the ear 
of the speaker and a late-film chase 
scene rendered with effects worthy 
of an early 2000s made-for-TV 
movie. The story might be uneven 
and the characters sketched just 
enough 
to 
become 
annoying 

— there’s a forced love triangle 
between Robin, Will Scarlet (Jamie 
Dornan, “A Private War”) and 
Marian that I simply don’t have 
the resolve to recount — but it’s 
the visuals that ultimately make 
“Robin Hood” nearly unwatchable.

Then there’s the ending, which 

tries with all the nuance of a 
toddler throwing a temper tantrum 
to set up a sequel, because if there’s 
one thing this sort of bad movie 
is always sure of, it’s that its own 
Marvel-style cinematic universe 
is one cliffhanger away. In its own 
way, that really puts into focus what 
went wrong with “Robin Hood.” 
This was never about telling a 
story that could accurately capture 
the legend of its lead. It was about 
using a recognizable public domain 
property to jumpstart a franchise 
that would be hip and cool and 
down with the kids. Based on how 
badly “King Arthur: Legend of the 
Sword” tried and failed at doing 
that same thing just last year, I can 
only wish the makers of “Robin 
Hood” a half-hearted “good luck 
with that.”

MUSIC PLAYLIST

Unless you are social media 

avoidant, 
you’ve 
probably 

noticed that The 1975 have finally 
released 
their 
long 
awaited 

A Brief Inquiry into Online 
Relationships, 
another 
banal, 

inflated attempt at aesthetically 
goth indie-rock. It’s tragic, really, 
because The 1975 have written 
some 
incredible 
songs 
that 

drown in filler like “Love It If We 
Made It,” a desperate track that 
seeks to shed light on the absurd 
resilience that pulls us through 
the crushingly fast-paced world 
we live in. Frankly, it really is 
that good.

And this is how I feel about 

winter — there’s beauty to be 
found in the filler of the seemingly 
endless monotone cold. Music 
truly is often seasonal, and while 
I love getting down to “Cut 
to the Feeling” at almost any 
given moment, it’s undeniably 
best enjoyed driving with all 
the windows down on a warm 
summer evening than huddled in 
three blankets. So, I’ve compiled 
a few songs to get us all through 
what is often considered the 
bleakest season; whether you 

want to get your mind off the 
cold or embrace the gray that has 
befallen us is entirely up to you.

Once 
snow 
first 
starts 

hitting the ground, my brain 
instinctively 
craves 
the 

detachment of Seahaven’s Winter 
Forever, whose opening track 
“Goodnight” sends shivers up 
the spine in the same way a sharp 
winter breeze would. If we’re 
being honest, the entire album 
is (obviously) perfect for when 
it feels like warmth will never 
return, but total submission 
to the cold has never been my 
style. Other standouts include 
“It’s 
Over,” 
“Understanding” 

and “Honeybee” when you want 
to revel in nostalgia for some 
sunlight.

Yaeji’s 
self-titled 
debut 

EP features one of her most 
criminally 
overlooked 
tracks 

“Feel It Out,” overshadowed 
by the domineering popularity 
of “raingurl.” “Feel It Out” 
embraces empty spaces, unafraid 
to create space in its sonic 
landscape. Yaeji’s minimalism 
reigns here, her synth oscillates 
in and out, sometimes entirely 
absent 
and 
other 
times 

dominating the melody. Her 
monotone is one of detachment, 
perfect for dissociating on early 

morning walks to class or work 
when the cold is at its worst.

But winter is certainly not a 

time for eternal sadness: The 
end of the semester is in sight, 
time with family finally becomes 
a reality and we can mentally 
reset in preparation for the new 
year. Although every following 
year seems to be at least as awful 
as the last, optimism is essential 
to pull through. The new Kim 
Petras single “Feeling of Falling” 
(featuring Cheat Codes) is a 
wonderful techno-pop fusion, 
her 
sugary 
vocals 
elevating 

above the stagnant quiet of 
an overcast world covered in 
snow. Sometimes you need to 
dance some warmth into your 
bones, and few artists are better 
equipped to get you moving than 
Kim Petras.

There’s no use pretending that 

winter is easy in the Midwest. 
With overwhelming amounts 
of snow and minimal sunlight, 
positivity 
must 
be 
derived 

elsewhere. I hope this playlist 
offers some comfort to those who 
suffer the most from this time, or 
at least gives some perspective 
into battling or embracing the 
season with music.

COMMUNITY CULTURE 

Jardín de amores, jardín de 

amores, Castigo liviano pudean 
merecer los amadores.

These words, projected unto 

me by some of the finest vocal 
chords at the University, have 
been ringing in my ears for 
some days now. Translated into 
English, the phrase means, 
“Gardens of love, gardens of 
love, those who love deserve 
only a slight penalty.” The 
piece, “Al tribunal de tu pecho 
vengo a pedirele Clemencia,” 
is from a 1967 set of songs 
called “Indianas” composed 
by Carlos Guastavino. Despite 
the language barrier and age 
of the piece, The Orpheus 
Singers were able to draw from 
the late Guastavino and, with 
their voices, create an impact 
on their audience. That is 
certainly something special.

This past Thursday, The 

Orpheus Singers, an ensemble 
with the School of Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
at 
the 

University, performed their 
second and final concert of 
the semester. The Orpheus 
Singers consist of graduate 
and 
undergraduate 
music 

majors in voice, choral music 
education, 
organ, 
piano, 

composition and harp, all of 
whom are conducted by Dr. 
Eugene 
Rogers’s 
graduate 

studio of Master of Music and 

Doctor of Musical Arts choral 
conductors.

This 
performance 
was 

called 
“The 
Poet 
Speaks 

of Love,” as the concert’s 
repertoire was chosen for each 
piece’s poetic description of 
love, ranging from playful and 
adoring to devoted, enduring 
and unrequited.

More 
than 
that, 
the 

performance included pieces 
from 
a 
wide 
selection 
of 

cultures and lingual origins. 
Director Dr. Eugene Rogers 
writes, “(t)he program, The 
Poet Speaks of Love, features 
a 
variety 
of 
music 
styles 

stemming from the diverse 
cultural background of the 
selected composers.”

Rogers 
included 
pieces 

extracted from choirs and 
conductors 
in 
America, 

Argentina, the British Isles, 
England, Canada, France and 
Brazil. Rogers also included 
works from composers both 
male and female, authors of 
varying ethnic backgrounds. 
It was clear that Rogers and 
his fellowship of conductors 
took care to truly explore the 
various perspectives of love in 
the world. This care made the 
validity and dedication of the 
group’s work visible, which 
has not gone unappreciated.

“The Poet Speaks of Love” 

was exhilarating, yet haunting. 
Each piece carried an explicit 
tone as given by its categorized 
heading 
— 
playful 
and 

adoring, passionate, devoted 
and enduring or unrequited 
— but each piece also held 
a more softly-spoken air of 
chanciness, precariousness.

Conducted by Eric D. Reyes 

with soprano Adriana Tam, 
“Nocture” from “Five Short 
Choral Works” by Adolphus 
Hailstork is written with a 
playful flow, inviting a lover 
to enjoy some of the world’s 
beauties. And yet the world’s 
beauties are presented as “the 
insects with their countless 
array of sounds,” “the black 
grass 
rustling,” 
“the 
suns 

floating (in the sky), each a 
fiery universe,” “the broad 
expanse” that is the night sky. 
All of these images are, to 
the writer, some of the finer 
qualities of the universe. But 
it is not difficult to see the 
underlying tone of darkness 
in the described beauty. The 
Orpheus Singers, so it seemed 
to me, picked up on the distinct 
tone, and presented Hailstork’s 
piece 
with 
the 
underlying 

grim mood. It was as though 
each performer knew that 
love, poetic as it may be, is not 
always light and certain.

It 
is 
always 
a 
joy 
to 

watch 
fellow 
students 
of 

the University pursue their 
interests, and it is even more 
enjoyable when these students 
can prescribe a unique message 
as The Orpheus Singers have 
done in their final concert of 
the semester.

ZACHARY W.S. WAARALA

Daily Arts Writer

Television is running out 

of tactics. With tropes like 
the nagging wife and goofy 
husband pairing or the fun-
loving gang of friends falling 
flat on viewers who expect 
more, showrunners are forced 
to look for another common 

thread to string together their 
shows with. It appears that 
they’ve found one in the form 
of reimagining history. And it’s 
working: Amazon’s “The Man 
in the High Castle,” which 
looks at a world in which, 
after World War II, the Axis 
powers emerged victorious, 
was recently renewed for its 
fourth season. This plot device 
asks: You know that thing that 
happened a while ago that 
seems like a pretty big deal? 
Well, what if that thing ... 
didn’t happen?

Now, a new Polish-language 

thriller from Netflix, “1983,” 
is hoping to find success in 
its alternate reality. It takes 
place in an alternate world 
where 
terrorists 
attacked 

Poland in 1983, suppressing 
the 
Solidarity 
movement 

and 
subsequently 
Poland’s 

liberation from the Soviet 
Union. In this realm, the 
Iron Curtain never fell, and 
Poland has sustained a rather 
peaceful existence until a new 
resistance movement begins to 
materialize in 2003.

The main storyline follows 

Anatol 
Janow 
(Robert 

Wieckiewicz, “Blinded by the 
Lights”) a steely detective 
well past his heyday as a 
high-profile investigator and 
Kajeton 
Skowron 
(Maciej 

Musial, “Rodzinka.pl”), a naive 
young lawyer. The pair are 
each investigating a mystery 
of their own, but they are 
brought together to uncover 
the conspiracy that hast kept 
Poland under dystopian reign 
for so long.

Dystopian 
markers 
are 

prevalent throughout every 
scene of “1983.” The aesthetic 
is 
gray 
and 
dreary; 
the 

characters appear weathered 
and anxious. Everything from 
the title of the show to the 
dialogue is a heavy-handed 
reference to George Orwell’s 
foundational 
novel 
“1984.” 

Poland’s government is known 
as “The Party,” which is split 
into 
various 
“ministries.” 

There are even multiple too-
obvious-to-miss shots of the 
book just in case you really 
weren’t picking up what the 
show was putting down.

Despite 
the 
dystopian 

backstory, 
“1983” 
thrives 

more as a mystery than an 
alternative 
reality 
story. 

Change up a couple details and 
this true-crime show may as 
well take place in New York 
City with Mariska Hargitay 
leading the investigation. It is 
a gripping detective story, and 
that is what makes it worth 
watching. The idea of Poland 
under Soviet control is second 
thought, playing into a lazy 
and reckless trope that forges 
an image of totalitarianism for 
entertainment as dictatorships 
rage on in the real world.

There is no joy in imagining 

what life would be like if the 
bad guys won. Whether it’s 
“1983” or “The Man in the 
High Castle,” the answer is 
pretty clear to that what-if 
scenario. If the bad guys won, 

life would be — and stay with 
me here — pretty damn bad. 
Why imagine a society still 
ruled by the Nazis when there 
are real-life Nazis in a world 
where the good guys did win? 
Why thrust a free nation into a 
falsified dystopian state when 
there are countries living that 
as their true reality? “1983” is 
an interesting detective story 
within a tired context, falling 
victim to the privilege of being 
able to imagine “what if.”

TV REVIEW

FILM NOTEBOOK

Here are two things that 

seldom go together: horror and 
beauty. It seems like the very last 
consideration many of us have 
when turning on a scary movie is 
the potential for visual splendor 
or cinematic style. And most of the 
time, our expectations are right. 
Horror movies are largely defined 
by a crudeness, an uncomfortable 
manipulation of our sensibilities. 
They aren’t made to amaze us. 
They’re made to make us scream.

That’s not to say, however, that 

style and scares can’t coexist. 
In fact, they can come together 

with 
overwhelming 
synergy 

when placed in the right hands, 
and have done just that in some 
of the most memorable horror 
movie moments. Think about the 
terrifying simplicity of Kubrick’s 
tracking shots of the tricycle in 
“The Shining.” The razor-sharp 
editing and piercing strings of 
the now-legendary shower scene 
from “Psycho.” Heck, even the 
uncannily ominous atmosphere 
that Jordan Peele musters leading 
up to the final act of “Get Out” is 
a testament to the value of artful 
horror.

But if there’s any filmmaker 

who so consummately embodies 
stylish horror, it has to be Dario 
Argento. The Italian director 

made his best work in the ’70s 
and ’80s, and his sheer artistic 
control over these films renders 
them inimitable and profoundly 
subjective. His stories are often 
a blend of mystery, thriller 
and horror, striking a balance 
between the brutally tactile and 
the disconnectedly ethereal. 

Argento’s specific brand of 

horror does not sacrifice scares 
for style, or vice versa. Not only 
are the two features equally baked 
into the DNA of his filmmaking, 
but they are inseparable from one 
another. His films are probably 
most 
recognizable 
by 
their 

affinity for gore and their unique 
depiction of the human body. 
His murder scenes are a prime

example of this quality. While 
initially jarring, the sequences 
turn intentionally cartoonish the 
longer one watches, showcasing 
ridiculously bright blood and 
limbs that seem more like the 
appendages of a doll than those of 
a human.

He is perhaps best known for 

his cult classic “Suspiria,” which, 
in the context of his evolution as a 
director, is a brilliant experiment 
in toying with the line between 
reality and fantasy. There are 
moments during the experience 
that not only ask one to question 
Argento’s reality, but their own as 
well. 

The lighting in “Suspiria” 

in particular is one of its most 
indelible aspects. Much of the 
film happens in the confines of 
a German dance academy, and 
every hallway is permeated with 
a ghostly red quality, whether 
by strange painted hues or some 
inexplicable source of crimson 
light. In one tension-filled scene, 
all the lights of the academy 
shut off, leaving us in temporary 
blackness only to give way to 
a 
new, 
pale 
night-vision-like 

perspective. The characters in 
the film can’t see this new light, 
lending the film the ability to bend 
and distort our perspective. By 
deftly intertwining the physical 
with the metaphysical, he allows 
viewers to interpret the film 
through a distinctly individual 
lens.

Director 
Luca 
Guadagnino 

(“Call Me By Your Name”) even 
recreated the movie with his own 

specific interpretation. His 2018 
remake of “Suspiria” showcases 
the variety of messages the 
original can impress onto its 
audience. He reinterpreted an 
admittedly simple story into 
something far more nuanced and 
political. Whether this choice 
was the right one is questionable, 
but it doesn’t matter either. It 
was 
inarguably 
Guadagnino’s 

own choice, a confident decision 
inspired by the ingenuity of his 
predecessor. That transition — 
the creativity of one filmmaker 
igniting that of another — speaks 
to the importance of films like 
Argento’s “Suspiria.”

There’s also something to be 

said about Argento’s fixation on 
artistically talented protagonists. 
Whether through the mystic 
dancing of Susie from “Suspiria,” 
the author of a serial killer novel 
that inspires a real-life copycat in 
“Tenebre” or a jazzy piano-player-
turned-murder-investigator 
in 

“Deep Red,” Argento relishes 
in the opportunity to connect 
the boldness of art with mortal 
danger. We’ve noticed a similar 
pattern even in Damien Chazelle, 
whose films “La La Land” and 
“Whiplash” 
depict 
the 
self-

corroding nature of musicians 
entrenched in their craft. While 
the 
two 
filmmakers 
clearly 

diverge in their subject material 
beyond this comparison, it is 
worth noting the tendency for 
directors in pursuit of artistic 
excellence to leak that excellence 
into their own characters. 

On the topic of music, it is 

impossible to even discuss Argento 
without any mention of his 
frequent collaborators, the Italian 
progressive rock band Goblin. 
The group’s auditory additions 
to his films are as disquieting 
and dreamy as the images they 
overlay. Goblin wrote twinkling, 
pulsating and at times operatic 
riffs that are somehow catchy and 
creepy at the same time. Their 
ability to seamlessly switch time 
signatures grants their scores an 
offsetting and incessant quality. 
Even a week after finishing “Deep 
Red,” I found it impossible to get 
the groovy soundtrack — or the 
film — out of my head.

An 
undermentioned 
and 

truly special effect of Argento’s 
signature subjectivity is this: 
His films can be as artsy or as 
uncomplicated as you want them 
to be. If you have the capacity 
to explore the various enigmas 
he posits, his heady symbolism 
and the significance behind his 
deceitful 
camerawork, 
those 

options are readily available. If 
all you want is to enjoy his movies 
for the twist-riddled, adventurous 
mysteries they are at face value, 
no one’s stopping you either. It’s 
easy to write off Argento as an 
artsy filmmaker purely for the 
horror-obsessed, but that couldn’t 
be further from the truth. His 
films are for anyone and everyone 
to see. At worst, they are exactly 
what you want out of them, and 
at best, they are deeply revelatory 
masterpieces that have elevated 
my understanding of cinema 
itself.

Worth the price of admission
S

eventy dollars.
That’s what some students 
paid 
to watch 
the men’s 
basketball 
team play 
Purdue on 
Saturday night. 
Seventy bucks 
and you’re 
allowed to wait 
outside for 
hours before 
the game, only 
to get in and cram your way into a 
corner of a sold-out Crisler Center, 
stretching from the floor all the 
way to the top of the second bowl. 
Or, if you’re lucky — and really, 
really dedicated to waiting outside 
in the rain — you might get a spot in 
the student section bleachers that 
run behind the benches.
Of course, that price did more 
than just get students a seat in the 
student section. It gave them the 
chance to watch the Michigan 
men’s basketball team grind out a 
top-20 win over the Boilermakers, 
a staple powerhouse team in the 
Big Ten.
Even on Wednesday, 40 bucks 
not only secured students a seat for 
the ‘Maize Out,’ but also a chance 
to see Michigan exact revenge 
over a North Carolina team that 
blew the Wolverines out last year. 
Michigan put on a show en route to 
an 84-67 win over the 11th-ranked 
team in the country.
Which, just like in Purdue’s 
game, featured a sold-out crowd.
Two back-to-back sellout 
games at this time last year wasn’t 
even close to an option for the 
Wolverines. In its first four home 
games this season (excluding 
Northwood’s exhibition), Michigan 
has drawn total crowd of 47,878 
people — last year, in the same time 
span, it was 37,473.
That change in numbers could 
be attributed to a lot of different 
things. Maybe, it’s a result of 
the novelty in opponents the 
Wolverines have been hosting. This 
season’s schedule has seen two 
ranked visitors step on the court 

in the Boilermakers and the Tar 
Heels, while last year, the highest-
profile home matchup Michigan 
had in the same four-game time 
span was with an unranked 
Central Michigan team.
It seems pretty obvious, 
though, that a difference of more 
than 10,000 people probably 
has to deal with more than just 
an uptick in scheduling. Maybe 
it has something to do with an 
undefeated 6-0 run to enter last 
week’s matchups with two ranked 
teams? Maybe it has to do with a 
redemption battle that resulted 
in a win over a team that chased 
the Wolverines out of the national 

championship last year? Or maybe 
people are paying attention 
to a team they think deserves 
the attention after a Final Four 
appearance less than a year prior?
Maybe one. Maybe all of the 
above.
Regardless of the reason, 
momentum is rolling. It’s felt in 
Crisler, spurring sellout crowds 
with fanatic eruptions in instances 
like when redshirt junior Charles 
Matthews threw down a dunk 
against the Tar Heels to secure a 
14-point lead. 
It’s in the arena, that’s for sure 
— but it’s also on the mind of the 
team.

“This energy from our (student 
section) has been fantastic. Thanks 
to every student for rooting for us,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein 
in a tweet on Saturday after the win 
over North Carolina. “We hear you! 
Hope you are having fun!”
The Wolverines are riding that 
energy, too. Currently sitting at 
No. 7 in the AP Poll — and likely 
to move up after Saturday’s 76-57 
win over Purdue — Michigan 
is embodying the mentality of 
a national contender, riding the 
nation’s top-ranked defense in 
adjusted efficiency to an 8-0 start 
of the season backed by junior 
guard Zavier Simpson and redshirt 

junior forward Charles Matthews. 
Last year, that adopted defensive 
identity took the team all the way 
to the Final Four. 
But this year, that defensive 
identity has been present from the 
start, enabling the Wolverines’ 
unbeaten stretch. That identity will 
stick with Michigan on Tuesday 
night, when it loses the home 
advantage to a midweek game at 
Northwestern. 
“(Michigan) can beat you in 
the nineties, I think they can beat 
you in the sixties, and I think they 
can do it against quality people,” 
said Purdue coach Matt Painter. 
“So it just depends on how they’re 

flowing.”
There’s no doubt the Wolverines 
are on a roll. Eight games with 
multiple wins over ranked teams 
means evident structure, and 
that’s not based on a home-crowd 
advantage, either. But that doesn’t 
matter to the students.
Seventy bucks might be steep, 
but this is a team worth paying for, 
as evidenced by its two most recent 
blowout wins.
So don’t expect big-game tickets 
to get cheaper anytime soon.

‘M’ beats Purdue, 76-57, behind hot shooting

Remember when Michigan 
scored 
119 
points 
combined 
against Norfolk State and Holy 
Cross, shooting 20 percent from 
downtown?
That was just three weeks ago. 
It certainly didn’t feel that recent 
Saturday against Purdue.
In a dizzying first 10 minutes 
of basketball, the seventh-ranked 
Wolverines (8-0 overall, 1-0 Big 
Ten) hit six of their first seven 
3-pointers to take a 31-16 lead, 
setting the nets, and Crisler 
Center, ablaze. That early stretch 
of dominance was all Michigan 
needed, as it ran away with a 
76-57 win over the 19th-ranked 
Boilermakers (5-3, 0-1) in its first 
Big Ten game of the season.
The dominance started in 
earnest two minutes into the 
game. Sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole took a Charles Matthews 
pass on the right wing, stepped 
into his shot and drained a wide-
open three. Matthews, a redshirt 
junior wing, hit one of his own 
on the next possession, and two 
minutes after that, Poole took a 
couple jab-steps and confidently 
drilled a trey right in the face of 
7-foot-3 center Matt Haarms to 
give the Wolverines a 16-7 lead.
“If I hit one, I definitely feel 
like I’m hot,” Poole said. “But 
then I hit another one and I’m 
like, ‘Alright, well, I’m definitely 
extremely hot right now, let me 
try to get up another one.’ ”
The 
Boilermakers’ 
switch-
happy defense was no match 
for Michigan in the early going. 
With 12:40 to play in the first 
half, junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson drove past Haarms 
for an easy layup, and kicked 
out of drives to find Poole 
and Matthews for wide-open 
3-pointers.
“They switched everything we 
did,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “So the best thing when 
you get in those situations, is 
get downhill when their big guy 
steps out to guard, get downhill. 
And we used the alleys really to 
get penetration and find other 
people.”
A possession after Matthews’ 

trey, junior center Jon Teske 
provided the hammer blow to cap 
off the initial outburst, catching 
Matthews’ over-the-shoulder lob 
and thundering down an alley-
oop on the Boilermakers’ Ryan 
Cline.
As the Wolverines made it 
rain, Purdue could only manage 
to stay afloat. Big Ten Preseason 
Player 
of 
the 
Year 
Carsen 
Edwards 
— 
averaging 
25.3 
points per game 
heading 
into 
the contest — 
scored 19 but 
had 
to 
fight 
for 
everything 
against 
the 
fierce 
defense 
of 
Simpson, 
making just seven of 21 mostly 
challenging looks.
“Carsen got his a little bit, but 
he was, I think 1-of-5 from three, 
and he was averaging like five or 
six,” Teske said. “And Cline had 
three in the first half, and I think 
Charles wore him down in the 
second half. It just starts with 
(assistant coach Luke Yaklich), 
and it trickles down to Charles 
and (Simpson) and the whole 
team just kind of follows them.”
Purdue hung somewhat within 
reach, though, and continued to 

chip away at the lead throughout 
the game. Michigan suffered 
through a five-minute scoring 
drought midway through the 
second half, and with 6:55 to 
play, Boilermaker guard Aaron 
Wheeler’s 
3-pointer 
cut 
the 
deficit to 62-50.
The Wolverines needed a 
response, and a response they 
got. Appropriately 
enough 
for 
an 
afternoon 
where seemingly 
everyone 
was 
on 
fire, 
Teske 
— 1-for-10 from 
deep coming into 
Saturday — hit 
two free throws 
and then a pick-
and-pop 
three, 
his second of the 
game, to push the lead back to 17.
“It was ready to go the other 
way,” Beilein said. “If they had 
gotten it lower than that it would 
have been tough, because we 
were not able to score the ball. 
So I think probably getting those 
stops when they got it to 12, and 
then … Jon made the two foul 
shots and then hit a three, that 
probably was (the turning point) 
because five minutes to go, a 12- 
point lead against those guys is 
nothing.”
Twenty-three seconds later, 

Poole canned his fifth trey, which 
just about put the contest to bed.
“We’re just confident,” Poole 
said. 
“We 
practice 
in-game 
situation threes and we run our 
plays and we know how the looks 
that we’re going to get. ... Being 
able to knock down those shots 
from the ‘1’ to the ‘5’ is definitely 
huge for us.”
Poole had the hot hand from 
the start, scoring 21 points and 
drilling all five of his attempts 
from outside. Matthews (nine 
points), Teske (17), and freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis (14) 
chipped in with three, two and 
two, respectively, while Simpson 
ran the offense efficiently once 
again with seven assists to 
only one turnover. As a team, 
Michigan was 13 for 26 from 
3-point range.
“They can beat you in the 
nineties, I think they can beat 
you in the sixties, and I think 
they can do it against quality 
people,” said Purdue coach Matt 
Painter. “So it just depends on 
how they’re flowing.”
On Saturday, the Wolverines 
were flowing as well as they’ve 
done all season. That meant 
trouble for the Boilermakers — 
and with a Michigan offense 
that’s finally catching up to its 
defense, it means trouble for the 
rest of the Big Ten.

Wolverines swept over 
weekend by Spartans

Losing to your rival always stings. 
But for the No. 14 Michigan hockey 
team (6-6-3 overall, 2-3-1-2 Big Ten), 
this one had to sting a little more.
In a game that was largely 
dominated by the Wolverines, they 
failed to capitalize on many scoring 
opportunities despite outshooting 
Michigan State (6-7-1 overall, 2-0-1-1 
Big Ten), 40-19, and ultimately losing 
in a shootout after a 1-1 draw.
The Wolverines are used to playing 
fast — they utilize the quickness on 
their roster to create opportunities 
in transition. On Saturday, they had 
a difficult time creating good scoring 
opportunities as Michigan State 
continually dropped back on defense, 
which clogged the ice and prevented 
transition opportunities.
Both sides, though, created a 
couple early scoring opportunities 
in the first period, but the chances 
were few and far between in what 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
described as an “ugly game.” At the 
end of the opening period, Michigan 
had nine shots on goal compared to 
six for the Spartans.
Junior defenseman Nick Boka 
eventually opened up the scoring 
on one of those early opportunities. 
It came just over eight minutes into 
the first period on the power play. 
Boka fired a one-timer from the left 
slot on a pass that navigated through 
traffic in front of the crease from 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes who was set up in the right 
faceoff circle. The shot fired past 
Michigan State goaltender Drew 
DeRidder for Boka’s first goal of the 
season and gave the Wolverines a 1-0 
lead.
Michigan looked to have all 
of the momentum early on in the 
second period, as the Spartans 
were unable to create any scoring 
chances through the first five 
minutes. That momentum was 
halted by a penalty for checking from 
behind on freshman defender Nick 
Blankenburg 5:23 into the period. 
About 30 seconds into the power play 
for Michigan State, an attempted 
clearance deep in the defensive 

zone from sophomore forward Josh 
Norris found a wide open forward 
Taro Hirose at the point. He skated 
forward into the slot and fired past 
freshman goaltender Strauss Mann 
to knot the score at one.
The Wolverines looked in control 
for the majority of the period 
and generated plenty of scoring 
opportunities as a result. Perhaps 
none better than on the power 
play with 5:42 remaining. The top 
defensive pairing for Michigan along 
with the top forward line retained 
possession for the entire power play 
but were unable to capitalize.
The shots finished 20-11 in favor 
of the Wolverines, but the score 
remained 1-1 heading into the second 
intermission.
In the third period, play was much 
more balanced in terms of scoring 
opportunities. 
Both 
Michigan 
and Michigan State had plenty of 
chances, including two power plays 
for the Wolverines and three for the 
Spartans. But the defenses remained 
stingy, jumping on loose pucks in 
front of the net and doing everything 
they could to prevent either side from 
getting an edge.
And for the fourth time in the last 
five games, the Wolverines went into 
overtime.
The 
first 
overtime 
period 
featured plenty of scoring chances 
for Michigan but its inability to 
score continued. Michigan State did 
not record a single shot in the first 
overtime period. More of the same 
ensued for three-on-three play. 
Michigan State
The winner of the game would 
be determined in a penalty shootout. 
Norris opened up the shootout but 
had his shot saved, as he failed to lift 
the puck above DeRidder’s left pad. 
It took until the fourth skater for the 
winner to emerge. Spartan forward 
Brennan Sanford slowly skated 
up from center ice, taking a wide 
angle. He skated across the slot from 
Mann’s left to right side and fired 
the puck above the goaltender’s left 
shoulder.

Skjodt, Michigan stun No. 12 Pittsburgh to clinch Sweet Sixteen berth

Carly Skjodt saw her storied 
career flash before her eyes on 
Saturday night.
Michigan’s unanimous All-
Big Ten First Team selection 
was held to just two kills on 
20 attempts in the Wolverines’ 
first-set loss against 12th-seeded 
Pittsburgh (30-2 overall, 17-1 
ACC).
Labeling Skjodt’s opening set 
performance as out of character 
would be an understatement. 
The Panthers came out with a 
well-crafted defensive gameplan 
devoted to hindering Skjodt, 
who averages the second-most 
kills per set in the Big Ten with 
4.20. Unseeded Michigan (24-9 
overall, 11-9 Big Ten) scrambled 
to find other options, and nobody 
took the reigns. Pittsburgh kept 
Skjodt bottled up for a set, but 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
knew it wouldn’t last.
Why?
“Because she’s Carly,” Rosen 
said with a chuckle. “She’s such 
an experienced player and she’s 
such a fighter. She’s our go-to kid 
for a reason. When she struggled 
in the first set, I wasn’t worried 
about it because I knew she 
was going to find a way to get it 
going.”
Following the first-set loss, 
Skjodt exploded 
for 18 kills and 
five blocks over 
the next four sets 
while 
guiding 
the 
Wolverines 
to a 19-25, 25-22, 
25-17, 21-25, 15-9 
upset victory in 
front of a hostile 
crowd of 2,405 
at 
Pittsburgh’s 
Petersen Events 
Center in the NCAA Tournament 
round of 32.
“I thought she needed to take 
a little more of an aggressive 
approach to it,” Rosen said. 
“Carly’s default is to be very 
controlled and to try not to make 

errors. Sometimes we have to 
challenge her to really go after 
it a little bit more, and I thought 
she answered that really well 
after the first set.”
Rather than caving in, Skjodt 
answered 
the 
call. She elevated 
her game to the 
next level, and 
her seven kills in 
the second frame 
— one of which 
ignited a three-
point scoring run 
to give Michigan 
a 
permanent 
lead at 22-19 — 
showed just how 
dominant she is at her peak. 
When the Wolverines’ lead was 
trimmed to 22-21 two points 
later, junior setter MacKenzi 
Welsh turned to none other 
that Skjodt. Like clockwork, she 
blasted a ball through the block 

to give Michigan its first set 
point.
The Panthers knew it was 
coming. The Wolverines knew 
it was coming. Everyone in the 
Petersen Center bleachers knew 
it was coming. 
Pittsburgh 
positioned 
a 
daunting double 
block of two All-
ACC First Team 
selections 
— 
6-foot-3 
Layne 
Van Buskirk and 
6-foot-1 
Nika 
Markovic — on 
the outside pin, 
but Skjodt still 
found a way to produce a point 
when she was needed most.
“That was a turning point,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“They 
were 
frustrated. You could just see 
it — they had three or four 
miscommunications and their 

passing started to break down. 
We knew the pressure was on 
them as the host team and the 
higher seed.”
When 
Michigan 
smelled 
blood in the water, it struck.
The 
Wolverines 
raced out to an 
8-3 lead in the 
third 
frame 
behind 
a 
five-
point service run 
by 
sophomore 
defensive 
specialist 
Natalie 
Smith. 
Pittsburgh 
coach 
Dan 
Fisher, who was crowned ACC 
Coach of the Year last week, 
called a timeout to compose his 
Panthers, but nothing could stop 
Michigan’s freight train of an 
offense from clicking. Coming 
out 
of 
the 
timeout, 
Welsh 

continued to pilot an efficient 
offense, and the Wolverines 
registered a staggering .480 
attack percentage en route to 
a convincing 25-17 win in the 
third frame.
With 
its 
season 
hanging 
in the balance, 
Pittsburgh made 
a major change to 
its system in the 
fourth set. Fisher 
opted to use a 
6-2 — a system 
that features two 
setters who take 
turns 
running 
the 
offense 
depending on which one is in 
the back row at a given moment 
— by adding an additional setter 
to the Panthers’ initial offensive 
scheme. By doing so, Fisher gave 
his team an extra attacker on the 
right pin at all times.

The 
adjustment 
caught 
Michigan 
off 
guard 
— 
the 
insertion of a sixth attacker in 
Pittsburgh’s rotation called for 
major changes in the Wolverines’ 
blocking scheme.

Kylee 
Levers 
and 
Kamalani 
Akeo 
seized 
an 
opportunity to revive a stagnant 
offense in the Panthers’ new 
system. The tandem recorded 
24 and 28 assists, respectively, 
and navigated Pittsburgh to 
a .275 attack percentage — a 
figure 
which 
comfortably 
trumped Michigan’s .163 clip. 
The Panthers fended off a late 
slew of kills from Skjodt and 
freshman outside hitter Paige 
Jones to take the fourth frame, 
25-21, and force a decisive fifth 
set as the crowd came to its feet 
in a standing ovation.
24 points later, the crowd 
rose once again. This time, they 
bolted for the exits in disbelief.
The only sound in Petersen 
Center 
was 
the 
shouts 
of 

Michigan’s 
enthralling 

celebration after its 15-9 fifth-
set statement sent them to the 
Sweet Sixteen. The Wolverines’ 
dominance — highlighted by 
a season-altering 9-0 run that 
put them up 11-3 — was on full 
display throughout the set as 
they thrashed Pittsburgh by 363 
attack percentage points and 
amassed seven of the their 12 
total blocks.
“One thing we 
talk about in the 
fifth set is being 
the 
aggressive 
team,” 
Rosen 
said. “It’s like a 
sprint. You can’t 
start 
slow 
or 
passively. 
You 
need to get after 
it, and I thought 
the 
blocking 
showed up and we served really 
well.”
Led by Skjodt’s relentless will 
to win, Michigan won the sprint 
by a landslide — stunning the 
ACC champions in the process.
And why? Because she’s Carly.

Senior outside hitter Carly Skjodt accumulated 18 kills and five blocks in the last four sets of Michigan’s win over Pittsburgh in the NCAA Tournament.

“She’s such an

“We knew the 
pressure was 
on them as the 
host team.”

Wolverines beat WMU, CMU, EMU in Quad Meet

Freshman 
gymnast 
Abby 
Brenner stood at the start of the 
vault runway, saluted the judges 
and took off toward the table.
In 
her 
debut 
for 
the 
Wolverines, Brenner executed 
her Yurchenko one-and-a-half 
with ease. She earned not only 
the highest score of the rotation, 
but the highest score of the entire 
competition on vault, a 9.875. 
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team 
led 
the 
competition 
after 
a 
strong 
opening 
rotation 
on 
vault 
in 
a 
quad 
exhibition 
meet 
against 
Central 
Michigan, 
Eastern Michigan and Western 
Michigan. Rotation by rotation, 
the Wolverines extended their 
lead to win by 3.125 points, 
finishing the meet with a final 
score of 195.125.
The exhibition meet offered 
Michigan its first opportunity of 
the season to perform its routines 
in front of judges and a crowd.
“We train and train and train 

in the gym and athletes get into 
a comfort zone,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “And this is 
clearly not in a comfort zone for 
them. There’s a lot of things to 
get used to and adjust to. The 
landing surfaces in training are 
a little softer and more forgiving, 
but 
these 
are 
harder.” 
At 
times, 
the 
Wolverines 
struggled. 
Sophomore 
Lauren 
Farley 
fell in the middle 
of 
her 
first 
release move on 
bars during the 
second 
rotation. 
Due 
to 
strong 
performances by the remainder 
of the lineup, her score was 
dropped, and the Wolverines 
stood ahead of the second-place 
Chippewas by just .625 of a point.
Mistakes followed Michigan 
to the balance beam. The third 
rotation was marked by wobbles 
and balance checks and was 
the lowest-scoring rotation of 

the evening for the Wolverines. 
Junior Lexi Funk led off on beam, 
and freshman Natalie Wojcik 
anchored it. Both preformed 
consistent routines and earned 
the two highest scores on the 
event.
Michigan closed the meet on 
floor 
exercise. 
Both 
Wojcik 
and 
Brenner 
performed 
successful, 
high-scoring 
routines to end 
their 
debut 
meet 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Wojcik won an 
event title on 
both bars and 
floor, as well as the all around 
title with a score of 39.225.
“Our freshmen were great 
today,” 
said 
senior 
Emma 
McLean. “I’m so proud of them. 
Their training in the gym every 
day is paying off, and I’m excited 
to see what they can do this year.”
In 
addition 
to 
strong 
performances 
by 
the 
two 

freshmen 
in 
the 
lineup, 
Michigan found consistency in 
other gymnasts. Junior Maggie 
O’Hara received a 9.825 for her 
bar routine after a near stick 
on her double layout dismount. 
Senior Olivia Karas, who was 
sidelined 
halfway 
through 
the season last year due to an 
Achilles tendon rupture, had a 
strong first meet back competing 
in three of the four rotations 
for the Wolverines. Her scores 
on vault and bars were second 
only to teammates Brenner and 
Wojcik. 
Michigan hopes to improve 
these performances further, as 
the Wolverines don’t have their 
first scored competition until 
Jan. 4 at the Cancun Classic, 
another quad meet.
“We like to take what we can 
learn from here and apply that 
to practice the next month,” 
said McLean. “So that when we 
really start, we come out of the 
gate strong versus today which 
was putting it together for the 
first time and seeing where 
we’re at.”

Polina Shchennikova 
helping ‘M’ as a coach

Shock. 
Disbelief. 
Crushing 
disappointment. Then-sophomore 
gymnast Polina Shchennikova was 
flooded with all of these emotions 
in April when doctors told her that 
her injuries meant she would never 
be able to compete again. 
“This sport was my life. It was 
my passion,” Shchennikova said. 
“And to have it end the way it did 
was definitely very hard —it was 
heartbreaking.” 
Shchennikova was left wanting 
to help her team in any way she 
could. So when she was offered a 
role with the Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team as a student 
assistant coach, she took the job —
and ran with it. 
Since taking on the role, 
Shchennikova has been helping 
the Wolverines with choreography 
and music for their floor routines. 
She has also been assisting with 
coaching efforts for the uneven 
bars, on which she was a “world-
class 
athlete,” 
according 
to 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki.
“She has done a fabulous job for 
us,” Plocki said. “She’s been really 
valuable.”
When working with athletes 
on floor routines, Shchennikova 
tries to tailor each element of 
the performance to the specific 
gymnast, 
focusing 
on 
how 
the 
gymnast’s 
body 
moves, 

how the music can tie in to a 
particular sequence and how the 
performance comes together as a 
whole to make the routines more 
personal. This attention to detail 
has brought new life and energy to 
the floor routines.
“She knows what style we 
like for dancing, and that’s really 
important because we’re able to 
get into it a lot more,” said junior 
gymnast Lexi Funk. 
The improved floor routines 
have already made a difference in 
Michigan’s scores in competitions. 
In their victory in an exhibition 
meet against Eastern, Western 
and Central Michigan on Sunday, 
the floor competition was the 
Wolverines’ 
second-strongest 
event of the day, with the six 
gymnasts who competed in the 
event totaling 49.025 points. 
Working 
with 
her 
former 
teammates 
as 
a 
coach 
and 
watching 
them 
all 
perform 
while 
not 
competing 
herself 
has been a difficult transition 
for Shchennikova, but coaching 
and choreographing has been a 
valuable experience.
“It’s never easy coming back to 
something that you love so much 
that was taken away from you,” 
Shchennikova said. “But when I got 
the opportunity to choreograph 
floor routines here, that was the 
most uplifting thing I could do. 
Since I couldn’t do gymnastics, 
this was the next best thing.”

Michigan suffers second-straight 
defeat at the hands of Marquette

At the five-minute mark 
of the first quarter, No. 21 
Marquette led 13-12. A frenetic 
pace and litany of turnovers 
characterized 
the 
opening 
minutes for both teams.
But from that point on, it 
seemed as if only one team was 
running, and the other was 
committing the turnovers.
The 
Golden 
Eagles 
dominated, hitting a trio of 
three-pointers — two of them 
in transition — to eventually 
open up a 10-point lead at the 
end of the first.
The rest of the game featured 
much of the same as Marquette 
(6-1) 
dispatched 
Michigan 
(5-3) easily by a score of 85-74. 
The eleven-point margin was 
deceiving, though.
“I think they did whatever 
they 
wanted 
to 
do,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
“They 
made 
an 
incredible 
amount 
of 
3-point shots, and they were 
tremendous off the bounce. 
Just really, really difficult for 
us to defend. We couldn’t get 
stops.”
Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense was nowhere to be 
found for long stretches of 
the first half, it was largely 
because they didn’t have time 
to set up in the half court. 
Between 
long 
defensive 
rebounds, quick outlets and 
turnovers, the Golden Eagles 
looked to exploit Michigan in 
transition.
Marquette 
hit 
eight 
3-pointers 
en 
route 
to 
a 
52-point output in the first half 
— more than the Wolverines 
had given up to Mount St. 
Mary’s and Western Michigan 
over the course of 40 minutes.
As a result of the Golden 

Eagles’ 
ability 
to 
shred 
Michigan’s 
defense, 
the 
inexperienced 
Wolverines 
forced 
the 
issue 
on 
their 
end. Quick shots and hasty 
possessions only served to 
exacerbate 
their 
defensive 
issues though.
“We started taking quick 
shots which resulted in poor 
transition 
defense 
because 
they were so quick,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“They 
were 
able to get easy 
baskets 
and 
drive and kicks 
off of our quick 
shots. I think we 
have to realize 
we have to be 
a 
little 
more 
disciplined 
in 
those situations. 
We need to use 
shot clock and 
make them run shot clock.”
Michigan 
struggled 
to 
find a rhythm for most of the 
game. Senior guard Nicole 
Munger poured in 12 points, 
as did freshman forward Naz 
Hillmon. But other than that, 
the Wolverine starters were 
largely ineffective offensively. 
Star senior forward Hallie 
Thome once again struggled to 
assert herself in the paint.
In 
comparison, 
all 
of 
Marquette’s 
starters 
scored 
in double digits. Senior Erika 
Davenport led the way for them 
with 21 points on 9-11 shooting.
“I thought their toughness 
and 
their 
hustle 
was 
tremendous,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “We talked about it a little 
bit, but they really got after 
us and I thought we would be 
better because we had a major 
size advantage. It was a little 
surprising that they came after 
us as aggressively as they did 
and we didn’t respond to it.”

Despite 
a 
poor 
overall 
performance, 
Michigan 
clawed its way back in the 
fourth quarter thanks in large 
part to the play of its bench. 
Sophomore 
guard 
Priscilla 
Smeenge, as well as freshmen 
Ariel Young and Emily Kiser 
particularly impressed. They 
faced a 26-point deficit at 
the beginning of the fourth 
quarter and turned it into 
just an 11-point 
defeat.
“I 
think 
that 
group 
— 
that 
group 
of 
freshmen 
that we have,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“You 
know you add 
Priscilla to that 
mix. 
They’re 
very coachable. 
They’re 
very 
open-minded. They want to do 
whatever they can do to help 
our team be successful. And I 
think they showed that tonight. 
They shared the basketball, 
they made extra passes.”
The game may have ended on 
a positive note, but the defeat 
is now the Wolverines’ third in 
the last four games — granted 
they have all been to ranked 
opponents.
Now, 
coming 
off 
that 
difficult non-conference slate, 
Michigan should be able to 
regroup a bit with three mid-
major opponents before Big 
Ten season gets underway at 
the end of December.
“We threw ourselves to the 
wolves a little bit,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But hopefully it’s 
eye-opening where we are and 
where we need to be, and what 
we need to do to get to where 
we need to be. That’s our goal. 
It will be nice to get to work 
and get to practice.”

wolves a little

Jordan Poole and finding a good shot

The 
dorm 
rooms 
at 
LaLumiere 
School 
are 
uniform. Pale. Dry. The exact 
same. So one day, coming off a 
national championship win, a 
young Jordan Poole turned to 
his roommate, future top-five 
NBA Draft pick Jaren Jackson 
Jr., with an idea in mind.
“Yo, Jaren, this room — it 
looks weak,” Poole recalled 
saying. “Let’s try something 
else. Let’s try something new.”
“Well, what are you trying to 
do?” he remembered Jackson 
asking.
“I don’t know, let’s just start 
moving 
stuff 
around. 
And 
whatever we come up with, we 
come up with.”
The beds got moved to the 
far wall, next to each other 
— a desk in the middle. Their 
TVs moved next to each other, 
as did the refrigerators, with 
chairs 
more 
conveniently 
placed. They took out some of 
the furniture they didn’t like.
“It was basically like one big 
game of Tetris or something,” 
Jackson recalled in a phone 
interview.
That’s Poole’s personality, 
too, rolled up into one story. 
He’s 
excitable, 
bordering 
on 
reckless 
at 
times, 
but 
everything 
he 
does 
helps 
a whole lot more than it 
hurts. That setup was better, 
allowing more space for more 
people. It is like his basketball 
game. When Poole finds a 
balance between reckless and 
aggressive, he shines.
Which brings us to Saturday 
on Michigan’s first possession 
of the second half, when Poole 
looked up, ball in his hands, 
and saw Purdue’s Matt Haarms 
squared up on him.
The sophomore guard jab-
stepped. He started a drive, 
then crossed over, leaving the 
Boilermakers’ 7-foot-3 big man 
a step behind. And then he 
spotted junior guard Zavier 
Simpson under the net — the 
paint otherwise vacated — and 
he whipped a one-handed pass 
for an uncontested layup.
It was a small flash, just 

another easy bucket in a game 
filled with them for both 
Poole and the Wolverines. 
As 
Michigan 
dominated 
Purdue, 76-57, Poole dropped 
21 points, a season high, on 
8-of-9 
shooting 
from 
the 
field, making all five of his 
shots from beyond the arc — a 
performance as notable for the 
shots he didn’t take as it was 
for those he did.
A year ago, Poole doesn’t 
make that pass to Simpson. He 
doesn’t pass out of a potential 
stepback 
3-pointer 
earlier 
on in the game with Carsen 
Edwards recovering to contest 
either. He didn’t all last year, 
and often got pulled as a result.
He has learned which shots 
to take and which to pass 
up. Games like Saturday’s — 
efficient, and lethally effective 
— are the result.
“(He has) gradually learned, 
less is more,” Michigan coach 
John Beilein said. “And he can 
get better shots. Guys like that 
that can get their own shots, 
have a lot of confidence, gotta 
realize, ‘I’ll take less shots but 
I’ll score more points.’ That 
usually is pretty motivating to 
people.”
Beilein is more willing to 
let Poole play through his 
mistakes now. The sophomore 
got called for a carry early 
in the second half against 
Purdue. Then, on the ensuing 
defensive possession, he forced 
a miss from the Boilermakers’ 

Evan Boudreaux, scrambling 
to contest a player with a 
three-inch height advantage at 
the rim.
Poole 
himself 
cited 
a 
turnover against Purdue where 
the coach said nothing to him, 
knowing he could play through 
it. He did, drawing a charge.
As 
for 
shooting, 
Poole 
struggled at the start of the 
season. He made one of his 
first 10 attempts from 3-point 
range. He’s now made nine of 
his last 10 — and, saving for one 
towards the end of a blowout 
win over North Carolina that 
went in, none have fallen 
under the label of reckless. 
Any mistakes he was making 
in that department seem well 
behind him.
Asked about any shift in his 
shot selection and how it might 
have happened, Poole took a 
long pause.
”I couldn’t tell you, bro. I 
don’t know,” Poole said. “When 
I shoot and coach (Beilein) 
don’t yell at me for saying it’s a 
bad shot. I feel like in practice 
I hit tough shots and I hit shots 
a lot of the time. When coach is 
able to see that I can hit those 
shots on a consistent basis, 
he lets me shoot them in the 
game.”
Beilein is letting him shoot, 
and Poole is providing the 
reward.
And like one big game of 
Tetris, his game is falling into 
place.

3-point shooting keys ‘M’ in victory

Just three weeks ago, when 
the Michigan basketball team 
beat Holy Cross in the second 
game of the season, the win 
carried a solemn air. It took the 
Wolverines to 2-0 but, for the 
second time in five days, they 
had shot less than 25 percent 
from deep.
Michigan’s defense meant 
it could survive its shooting 
woes, but for a program whose 
offensive identity has revolved 
around the 3-pointer under 
coach John Beilein, making 
just nine of its 45 3-point tries 
was a problem.
“If you look at our numbers 
in practice and everything, 
it’s just—it’s not happening,” 
Beilein said at the time.
Six 
games 
later, 
the 
Wolverines 
look 
like 
a 
legitimate 
national 
title 
contender. 
Their 
defense 
continues to be the main 
reason for that — they lead the 
country in adjusted defensive 
efficiency and have held two 
top-11 offenses under 70 points 
in the past four days.
But Michigan’s offense is 
starting to pull its weight, 
and it has its 3-point shooting 
to thank. The Wolverines — 
buoyed by a combined 24-of-
48 effort from three — looked 
like an offensive machine at 
points in this week’s wins over 

North Carolina and Purdue, 
finding open looks with ease 
and nailing contested threes 
when they had to.
“It’s all about our passing 
really, that we’re seeing each 
other,” Beilein said after a 
13-of-26 3-point performance 
against the Boilermakers. “The 
ball stuck a couple of times 
today, but other than that, if we 
can just keep moving the ball 
and get live action, somebody’s 
gonna come open. Somebody’s 
gonna make a mistake and 
leave one of our guys.”
Before the season, whenever 
Beilein was asked who would 
step up after Michigan lost 
its top three 3-point shooters 
from last season, he defaulted 
to sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole. But Poole opened the 
season by making just one 
of his first 10 attempts from 
three, and his struggles seemed 
to infiltrate the offense as a 
whole.
Now, the Wolverines have 
found the balance to survive 
when Poole struggles, as he did 
in the first half against the Tar 
Heels. But when Poole makes 
his threes, the full firepower 
of Michigan’s offense is on 
display.
That was the case Saturday 
afternoon against Purdue, as 
Poole went 5-of-5 in a 21-point 
performance.
“I’ve worked so hard in the 
gym,” Poole said. “Me and 

(assistant) 
coach 
(DeAndre 
Haynes) alway find ways that 
I can get my shots. They’re 
gonna 
fall 
eventually, 
you 
know what I’m saying?”
Added Boilermakers coach 
Matt Painter: “You can’t let 
Jordan Poole get five good 
looks.”
That showing on Saturday 
forced Purdue to keep an eye on 
Poole throughout the contest, 
allowing 
redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews 
and junior center Jon Teske 
to go a combined 5-of-8 from 
three. When the Boilermakers 
held the Wolverines without a 
field goal for over nine minutes 
in the second half, it was Teske 
who broke the drought with a 
pick-and-pop three.
“We got guys like Jon and 
(junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson) 
and 
(sophomore 
forward) 
Isaiah 
(Livers) 
staying after practice to shoot 
threes because we know that 
it’s a huge part of our game,” 
Poole said. “So being able to 
knock down those shots from 
the ‘1’ to the ‘5’ is definitely 
huge for us.”
On 
Saturday, 
that 
same 
effect worked in reverse. One 
possession after Teske’s three, 
he got the ball at the top of 
the arc and looked to shoot. 
Recognizing the threat, two 
defenders closed in on Teske, 
leaving Poole wide open to 
his left. Teske found Poole, 
and just like that, Michigan 
had shut the door on Purdue’s 
comeback hopes and restored 
its lead to 20.
“I’m 
not 
gonna 
force 
anything,” Teske said. “I was 
gonna try to shoot that third 
one, but Carsen (Edwards) 
was right there so I kicked it 
to (Poole), I know (Poole is) a 
better shooter than me.”
As the Wolverines’ perfect 
start has proven, they can win 
with defense. This morning, 
Beilein woke up, flipped his 
calendar to December and 
reflected on what he called a 
“pretty good” November.
If 
Saturday’s 
3-point 
shooting is any indication, 
December could be even better.
