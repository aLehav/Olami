After controversy
Saturday, student-
driven petition
draws 10,000
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily News Editor
A University student petition
calling for Athletic Director Dave
Brandon to be relieved from his
post has collected 10,101 signa-
tures as of 1 a.m. Wednesday.
Ford School graduate student
Zeid El-Kilani has created a peti-
tion through the Central Student
Government's UPetition web-
site, stating that the University's
football program has become a
"black eye" for the University and
requests President Mark Schlis-
sel remove Brandon. The petition
summary notes the athletic pro-
gram's historic ability to provide
prestige to the University, both as
a recruiting aid for new students
and a source of pride for alumni,
saying the department currently
runs the risk of "producing a gen-
eration of alumni that are disin-
terested and disengaged."
El-Kilani's petition was
launched late Monday evening
;n tvw wue f the football team's

third loss in a row over the week-
end, a game that generated a
range of criticisms of Brandon
and the department forpoorlead-
ership and treatment of player
safety. He said the petition speaks
to broader concerns about Bran-
don's handling ofthe department.
"It didn't have anything to do
with the football field. I think
it comes at a time where we're
facing national attention and
increased scrutiny about the way
our Athletic Department handles
situations," El-Kilani said.
Since Saturday, both Bran-
don and Michigan coach Brady
Hoke have received criticism for
improper practices.. For Hoke,
his failure to remove sophomore
quarterbackShane Morris from
the game following a helmet-to-
helmet hit - causing what Bran-
don called a "mild concussion"
- had fans calling his concern for
player safety into question. Bran-
don released a statement early
Tuesday morning admitting the
situation was poorly handled,
specifically citing sideline com-
munication. Additionally, fans of
the teamhave voiced displeasure
at the team's historically poor per-
formance, as Michigan lost three
matchups in September for the

a Spanish tapas restaurant, is
owned by an Albanian Ameri-

In an interview with The

he was especially proud of the
success of Albanian-American

"My message was just to
congratulate them for their
achievement here," Nishani
said. "We have a very good and

Prominent Arab-Israeli author Sayed Kashau discusses his experiences in Palestine at the Alumni Center Tuesday.
Noted Israell Arab writer

A noted author
and screenwriter,
Kashua calls for
peace in Middle East
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
Prominent Arab-Israeli author
Sayed Kashua spoke Tuesday eve-
ning at the Alumni Center as part
of an event titled the "Foreign
Mother Tongue: Living and Writ-
ing as a Palestinian in Israel."
Though the event was not
sponsored by the University,
several campus organizations
including the University's Judaic
Studies department, Helen Zell
Writers' Program, the Center for
Middle Eastern and North Afri-
can Studies department, the Near
Eastern Studies department and
Comparative Literature depart-
ment hosted the lecture.
Shachar Pinsker, a professor of
Hebrew Literature and Culture,
moderated the event.
Kashua discussed how he
recently left his home in Israel
following the events there this
summer. He wrote about his deci-
sion to leave in a columnin the
Guardian titled "Why I Have to
Leave Israel."

"Last summer was catastroph-
ic," Kashua said, "For the first
time in my life, I'm not sure Ihad
a lot of reasons to be optimistic."
As a Palestinian living in Israel,
Kashua said he has felt conflicted
over his Israeli identity and citi-
zenship.
"I am a citizen [of Israel],
because I have no other citizen-
ship," Kashua said, "I am a citizen
because I care about the future,
and I am a citizen because I used
to believe, and maybe stillbelieve
in some naive way that we can
live together and exist together
equally - Christians, Jews and
Muslims."
Kashua is also the writer and
creator of-an Israeli television
show called "Arab Labor." The
show centers on an Arab family
living in Israel and their encoun-
ters assimilating into Israeli soci-
ety.
He mentioned the importance
of using comedy and humor-
ous stereotypes in the show to
humanize the characters. Kashua
said this is especially important
when portrayingthe Arab minor-
ity characters on the show.
"I do believe in minority
humor," Kashua said. "There is
nothing funny about being a
majority."
Kashua is also an acclaimed
novelist. He has published three

books, one of which won the
Berstein Prize, an Israeli literary
award for authors younger than
s0.
Kashua is unique as a Palestin-
ian author because he writes in
Hebrew, though his works have
been translated into English.
After age 14 he was educated in a
school for gifted students in Jeru-
salem that only had books written
in Hebrew.
Kashua said language has
always been an integral part ofhis
background and identity.
"I wanted to tell, in Hebrew,
about my father who sat in jail for
long years, with no trial, for his
political ideas," Kashua wrote in
the Guardian. "I wanted to tell
the Israelis a story, the Palestin-
ian story."
J Street Umich, a student orga-
nization dedicated to achieving
a two-state solution to the Arab-
Israeli conflict, encouraged their
members to attend and held a dis-
cussion after the event.
LSA junior Arielle Schoenburg,
co-chair of J Street, said this issue
is important to her as an Ameri-
can Jew who wants to see Israel
as a democratic Jewish state.
"I think it is super important to
continue talking about this issue,
especially in light of what hap-
pened last semester," Schoen-

return to Albania and help the
country to further prosper.
"He is pretty interested in
Albanian students here and he
obviously wants us all to go back
and be involved with Albania,"
Egli Lika, Engineering freshman
and a member of the AASO said.
Nishani said he advocates cre-
ating an education-driven envi-
ronment in Albania.
"I have supported the objec-
tive and aims of the government
to do a ranking of high schools
and universities in Albania, but it
must be transparent, it must be a
real one and it must be considered
by appropriate mechanisms and
institutions."

The medal is annually awarded
to someone who embodies Wal-
lenberg's courage and dedica-
tion to humanitarian values. Past
recipients of the award include
Ele Wiesel, Miep Gies and Ten-
zin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai
Lama of Tibet.
Instead of presenting a lec-
ture on the podium, Heller broke
with tradition and chose to havea
conversation with Judaic Studies
Chair Scott Spector, who is also
profssor of history, German an'd
Germanic Languages and Litera-
ture.
During much of the conversa-
tion, Heller reflected on her expe-
riences during the Holocaust and
Hungary under Soviet control
and how those periods influenced
her work. She said philosophy is
an expression of experiences.

"I had the experiences of total-
itarianism and the Holocaust,"
Heller said. "When I started to
write, these two experiences
inspired me to think about eth-
ics." .
Heller also discussed her
thoughts on higher education.
She criticized the high cost of the
European and American univer-
sity system and the persistent idea
that a university education is the
sole path in gaining knowledge
and becoming successful.
"Sometimes in the universi-
ties people are not encouraged to
think with their own mind," Hell-
er said. "Whenithre are100 stu-
dents in a class, you cannot teach
them as individuals."
John Godfrey, assistant dean
for International Education in
the Rackham School of Graduate
Studies, said Heller is a remark-
able speaker and a passionate
individual.
"She has always been dogged

and fearless and persistent in her
fundamental inquiry in morality
of good and evil in the modern
world," said John Godfrey, assis-
tant dean for International Edu-
cation in the Rackham School of
Graduate Studies. "She has always
spoken out against repression and
efforts to distinguish free and
open inquiry. She is a remark-
able intellectual of extraordinary
accomplishments and enormous
personal resilience."
When the floor was opened for
questions, Heller wakr:2 rff
stage to stand next to the students
lined up at the microphone so she
could answer them directly.
"I thought it was a master
class on teaching," Godfrey said.
"Her absolute direct and hon-
est engagement with the ques-
tions and the students who asked
questions was profoundly mov-
ing. She's utterly fearless and she
showed how important courage is
in the classroom."

Regime ensures
no images of Hong
Kong events are
seen in mainland
BEIJING (AP) - China's
government has cut off news
about Hong Kong's pro-
democracy protests to the rest
of the country, a clampdown so
thorough that no image of the
rallies has appeared in state-
controlled media, and at least
one man has been detained
for reposting accounts of the
events.
By contrast, media in semi-
autonomous Hong Kong have
been broadcasting nonstop
about the crowds, showing
unarmed students fending off
tear gas and pepper spray with
umbrellas as they call for more
representative democracy in
the former British colony.
The contrast highlights the
differences in the "one coun-
try, two systems" arrange-
ment that China's Communist
Party agreed to when it nego-
tiated the 1997 return of Hong
Kong. It also reflects Beijing's
extreme sensitivity about any
possible sparks of pro-democ-
racy protest spreading to the
mainland.
"The authorities see this
a a a'r of life and death,"
said Shanghai-based colum-
nist and independent analyst
Zhao Chu. "Thy don't see it as
alocal affair but a fuse that can
take downotheir world."
In Hong Kong, broadcasters
NOW and Cable TV.have car-
ried wall-to-wall coverage of
the unfolding events, includ-
ing student leaders storming
government headquarters Fri-
day and the running clashes
with police over the weekend.
Hong -Kong's pro-democracy
newspaper, the popular Apple
Daily, has run its own live
Internet feed that features
aerial images of the crowds
captured bya drone.
Beijing clearly has not been
pleased with the unfettered
coverage and has appeared to
lump the Hong Kong media
outlets in with foreign ones.
"Several Western media are
making a big fuss, and some
even have done live casts," said
an editorial on the party-run
news site of the People's Daily.
While Hong Kong enjoys
civil liberties unheard of
on the mainland under the
"one country, two systems"
arrangement, the situation
is vastly different in Beijing's
official media, through which
the authorities can largely
control the narrative on any
outbreaks of unrest in the
mainland.
The coveage of the Hong
Kong protests has been con-
fined in mainland China to
TV anchors reading brief
statements with no video and
text reports with no photos.
The reports have mostly men-
tioned illegal gatherings in
Hong Kong and the efforts of

authorities to disperse them.
The Hong Kong-based
China Media Project counted

only nine articles in Chinese
newspapers Tuesday about the
protests, six of them stemming
from asnews release by the offi-
cial Xinhua News Agency say-
ing the protestsahad hurt Hong
Kong's economy and misquot-
ing a high-profile university
administrator as saying stu-
dents should disperse.
The other three pieces
appeared in the nationalis-
tic newspaper Global Times,
which called the gatherings
illegal, disruptive of social
order andharmfulto the econ-
omy.
Censorship of microblogs
- including phrases such as
"tear gas" - has kept online
discussion muted. The image-
sharing Instagramservice was
shut down in China over the
weekend.
"The clampdown has been
most thorough, covering all
media - traditional or new,
central or local, governmen-
tal or market-oriented," Zhao
said.
Some images from Hong
Kong's streets haveseeped into
the mainland via cellphone
messaging services. Many
users have converted words
into images to avoid having
searchable text that can be
easily caught by censors. Still,
users are complaining of posts
being deleted, including in pri-
vate chatsawith friends.
Activist Wang Long in the
southern city of Shenzhen,
who repost nes about the
protests on the instant sies-
saging service WeChat, was
detained Monday by police on
suspicion of causing trouble,
his lawyer friend Fan Biaowen
said.
The controls have been
largely effective.
"The majority of the Chi-
nese public does not know
what's going on in Hong Kong.
Only a handful know," said
Beijing-based journalism pro-
fessor Zhan Jiang.
While Hong Kong is out-
side China's "Great Fire Wall"
that blocks mainland access
to many foreign Internet news
and social sites, authorities
could conceivably shut down
the Internet there - as they
have done in the country's res-
tive ethnic regions - because
of their control of telecommu-
nications companies.
For now, that seems unlike-
ly because the move would
dent Hong Kong's image as an
open financial center.
Nevertheless, rumors of
that possibility have fueled a
rush to download Firechat,
a messaging service that can
send and receive messages
without an Internet connec-
tion. Instead, the handsets can
message each other ina daisy-
chain fashion that creates a
cloud-like network.
Beijing is on edge because
it fears the social movement
in Hong Kong and its appeal
for democracy could galvanize
members of the Chinese pub-
lic, said Zhao, the analyst from
Shanghai.
"It must be tightly con-
trolled so it will not infect the

mainland," he said.

Coalition aims to educate
youth on health insurance

Intiative to highlight
how to enroll for
universal healthcare
By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT
For the Daily
Get Covered America, a
national health care enrollment
coalition, launched the Michigan
Youth Outreach Advisory Coun-
cil last month in an effort to edu-
cate young adults and encourage
enrollment in the Affordable
Care Act.
The Youth Advisory Outreach
Council will be led by GCA com-
mittee members state Reps.
Adam Zemke (D-Ann Arbor)
and Phil Phelps (D-Flushing),
Lansing-area philanthropist
Lauren Aitch and Emily Tode-
bush, State Public Affairs Chair
of the Michigan State Council of
Junior Leagues.
"Health coverage outreach
and education to young adults
is critically important," Zemke
said. "While young consumers
stand to benefit greatly from the
new options under the Afford-
able Care Act, they are often new
to health insurance and tend to
lack health coverage literacy."
The council is emphasizing
the special enrollment period,
which is eligible for those who
have a "qualifying life event,"
such as loss of current coverage,
marriage, birth, adoption or a

change in immigration status.
Otherwise, under the ACA,
Americans can only enroll dur-
ing specific periods. After the
initial enrollment period ended
March 31, the next opportunity
will begin Nov. 15.
The campaign-is also targeting
college campuses due to the large
number of people who will soon
experience' a health insurance
change. At the age of 26, citizens
can no longer use their parents'
healthcare plan.
"This is an opportunity to
reach a group of people who
are not going to be on their par-
ents' insurance for much longer,
whether they're going into the
Marketplace or they're lucky
enough to find a job that offers
them care," Todebush said.
Erin Knott, state director of
GCA, said the mission of the
program is informing Michigan
youth, improving the conditions
for ACA overall as more young
citizens are aware of its benefits.
"Our goal is educating young
adults about what it means to
have health insurance, the dif-
ference between co-pays and
premiums," Knott said. "But stu-
dents also become messengers.
They go and talk to their friends
about it and spread the word."
In previous years, GCA used
local areas to target the youth.
According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Ser-
vices, more than 8 million people
enrolled in the Health Insur-

ance Marketplace over the first
enrollment period. In the state
of Michigan, a reported 272,539
people enrolled.
"This year, our staff is dedi-
cated to beingbigger and bolder,"
Knott said. "We're trying to go
deeper into communities and
find those folks who didn't sign
up, and we're tryingto get people
to enroll with no competing cir-
cumstances."
Todebush, who was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis in early
2013, offers a unique perspective
on the health care issue.
"My condition is not easily
diagnosed because it's a long pro-
cess of tests and meetings with
doctors that are all expensive,"
Todebush said. "If something
like this could happen to me, it"
can happen to anyone, no matter
how young and healthy."
The ACA, commonly referred
to as "Obamacare," has been: a
prominent and polarizing politi-
cal issue on the national level. It
also experienced multiple tech-
nical issues and failures in its'
initial launch. Sept. 30 marked
a deadline for enrolled families
to verify their incomes or else
pay back subsidies they received
under the ACA. The council
stresses that this is now law, and
politics are no longer an issue or a
barrier to enrollment.
"This isn't a left or right issue,"
Knott said. "What we're doing is
cutting out the rhetoric and just
giving people the facts."

Too little, too late
The 'U' must make students its first priority on and off the field
aturday afternoon, sophomore quarterback Shane Mor-
ris took a helmet-to-helmet hit during the fourth quarter
of the Michigan football team's game against Minnesota.
Morris remained in the game after exhibiting concussion-like
symptoms, obvious even to the untrained eye. After further
assessment of an ankle injury sustained earlier in the game
by the head athletic trainer, Morris was cleared and allowed
into the game in blatant disregard for concussion protocol and
player safety. In the days that followed, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke, Athletic Director David Brandon and University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel respectively released official statements
about Saturday's mishap. However, the lack of a timely and
forceful response from the University Athletic Department,
the University's Board of Regents and Schlissel and the ris-
ing discontent among students and alumni propelled the story
toward a national discussion about Michigan athletics and the
way it treats its students on and off the field. Moving forward,
the University and the Athletic Department must be transpar-
ent in their actions and make students their first priority.

The future in our hands

Recently, I've been hearing
an uptick in remarks from
friends and colleagues about
the distressing
state of our world
today, often citing
examples like the
conflict in East-
ern Ukraine, the
rash of airplane
crashes and/
or disappear- VICTORIA
ances, the rise in
anti-Semitism in NOBLE
response to the
latest waves of
violence between Hamas, the Pales-
tinian Authority and the Israeli gov-
ernment (and the violence itself), the.
global response (or lack thereof) to
the Ebola crisis, failure to converge
in collective action on environmental
issues, the handling of the Ferguson
protests andthespreadandactionsof
ISIS. Consideringthese examples, it's
hard to answer the questions of what
kind of world do we live in? with any-
thing but negative replies. Butthat's
the wrong question altogether.
As students, it would be funto
believethat the workthat we're doing
right here and now can seismically
affect the systematic destruction
that we see in the world today -
but for the most part, save for a few
rather impressive exceptions, we
unfortunately can't. The decisions
shaping global interactions todayare
made by men and women who were
educated years ago. As we further
our own education and careers, the
more relevant question becomes:
what kind of world do we want to
live in?
We have the awesome - and I
really do mean to use that adjective
literally - privilege of shaping the
future world. So pay attention,
because the problems of today

will soon be lessons of the past -
simultaneous sources of failure
and wisdom, actions that lay the
seedbed for future progress and
further regression into violence and
regional entropy.
The Cold War proxy war in
Afghanistan, lasting from December
1979 to February 1989, is an example
of this. The United States aided and
effectively armed the mujahideen to
help combat the ideology behind the
Brezhnev Doctrine. The victory over
the Soviet Army was quite profound,
andleftalastingvictoryforcapitalism
and democracy over socialism,
and marked the turning point in
the eventual dismantling of the
Soviet state.
The actions of the leaders at the
time laid the groundwork for the
issues that the now matured leaders
of our world today contend with.
U.S. foreign policy in the Afghan
intervention was a contributing
factor to the rise of Al-Qaeda and
other powerful yet extreme groups.
As a more mundane example, Samuel
Huntington's Clash of Civilizations
academic work influenced the
ideology of this same group.
To maintain that the current
events and their analysis won't be
relevant by the time that it is our
time to lead is nonsense. We live in
an important period in international
relations and domestic politics. The
moves our leaders make in dealing
with ISIS will shape regional culture
long-term, impacting the types and
strength of movements that could
gain traction in the Middle East in
the future. The multilateral public
health response to the Ebola cri-
sis will not only set a precedent for
future efforts, but also all but deter-
mine whether or not the disease will
become introduced outside of the
region in non-hospital settings. Sys-

tematic review of police policy and a
conscious look at cultural attitudes
in response prevent a repeat occur-
renceofthe Michael Brownshooting
could substantially affect race rela-
tions andthe quality ofthe American
criminal justice system. There is no
issue today that won't have a lasting
affect on the work that may need to
be done in the future.
We will have to collectively
determine what kind of world we
will want to live in as adults. But,
to quote my favorite musical "The
Sound of Music," "nothing comes
from nothing, nothing ever could."
The basis for our decisions about
what to do next must be predicated
on what has already has been done.
Even if we aren't conscious of the
events that shape future interaction,
the implementation of policy will
reflect the impact of past realities.
So read, and read a lot. Learn, and
seek out the experiences to learn as
much as you can about anything and
everything. Undoubtedly, many of
us will eventually find ourselves in
highly responsible positions with
the ability to affect the outcomes
of very pressing situations. But
even before we get to that point, it's
important to remember that we live
in a democratic country. The option
to hold the powerful accountable
and affect political decisions rests
in the hands of all of us (assuming
that we are all 18 and don't have any
unserved jail time). Hopefully, we'll
fulfill our civic responsibility this
Novembertocast aninformedballot.
Understanding the current world
is key to determining what kind
of world we want to live in later
down the road - and how to build
that world.

The Athletic Department's handling of
the situation after the game and its response,
or lack thereof, was a total failure. Hoke's
postgame press conference indicated his
total ignorance regarding the incident,
and his official statement, released Sunday
afternoon, didn't address Morris' head
injury. ByrtSunday night, th faiure of they
Athletic Department to address the situation
and admit shortcomings allowed the story to
hit all the major news outlets, even taking a
segment on ABC's "World News" and "Good
Morning America."
In his weekly Monday press conference,
Hoke remained blatantly unprepared, did
not know key information and repeatedly
answered questions by asking reporters to
refer to a forthcoming statement from the
medical staff. At 12:52 a.m. Tuesday morning,
that statement did not come from the medical
staff, rather it came from Brandon, who
addressedthesituationonbehalfoftheAthletic
Department. The statementcontradicted many
of Hoke's half-answers during his earlier
press conference. Most notably, Brandon
confirmed Morris had suffered a "probable,
mild concussion," when previously Hoke stated
therg had been no signs of head trauma.
According to Brandon, the oversight
occurred because medical personnel and the
coaching staff did not see the hit. A general
failure of communication further prevented
the proper and timely handling of Mor-
ris' head injury. Though this statement and
statements from Hoke don't suggest inten-
tionality, there is no acceptable excuse for
compromising player safety, as negligence is
equally as deplorable. The players on the field
are entwined in a culture of toughness and
playing through injury without much regard
to the potential hazards of doing so. The
decision to play cannot be left to the students.
ESPN Broadcaster Ed Cunningham
lambasted the team for its lack of concern
for Morris' safety for multiple minutes on air
during the game, both before the hit to the
head while Morris was limping around with
an ankle injury and after the hit. The crowd
booed loudly when Morris was left in and
subsequently when he reentered the game.
Because the hit on Morris occurred after the
ball left his hands, the coaches were no longer

watching the quarterback when the incident
happened, and therefore, sideline staff
assumed his post-hit stumbling was due to
his ankle injury. The lack of communication
between coaching staff, athletic trainers and
the team neurologist prevented Morris from
receivinag 'a l4. examination and allowed
for his reinsertion into the game; Brandofs
statement early Tuesday :morning, outlines
a plan to have a medical professional in
the press box or video booth to ensure that
this situation will not happen again due to
a failure to see the entirety of the play, and
also says the team is examining its sideline
communications with regard to player
injuries. These proposed changes, supported
by Schlissel in his statement, and by the
NCAA, must be implemented immediately.
This incident was just the tipping point
for public opinion of the University Athletic
Department. Students feel a large disconnect
with the Athletic Department, especially in
light of the failed implementation of a general
admission seating policy at football games
and the switch to a claims-based system for
basketball tickets. Furthermore, students
and non-students alike are fed up with
historically high ticket prices, especially
for a season with one of the weakest
home schedules in recent memory and an
increasingly over commercialized stadium
culture. Many fans feel loyalty is no longer
rewarded, as exemplified earlier in the week
with the two Coke products for two tickets
marketing ploy. In addition, the mishandling
offormerkickerBrendanGibbons'permanent
separation from the University after being
found responsible for violating the school's
sexual misconduct policy contributed to the
simmering discontent of many students.
Overall, the Athletic Department's
public relations has failed to positively
engage students, alumni and fans, leading
to Tuesday's protest and petition through
the CSG website calling for Dave Brandon's
resignation that has amassed over 10,000
signatures. In order to rectify the situation,
the University administration and the
Athletic Department must restructure their
priorities to include the safety and well-being
of student athletes while also keeping the
input of all students in mind.

Send them in

While engineers looking
uncomfortable in their
formal wear handed
out resumes at
the career fair
just outside, 20
clowns took turns
sweeping the floor
of the Walgreen
Drama Center on
North Campus.
They sat in a
long row on the AVERY
gray linoleum. DIUBALDO
Each wore a
red plastic nose
strung up with a loop of elastic that
dangled from his neck or rode high
on his forehead like a miner's lamp.
All were students in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, and for 17 of
them, this class - listed dryly in the
course guide as "Physical Theater" -
was required for their graduation in
the spring.
On the far wall, facing them, a
black curtain stretched up toward
the ceiling; between the clowns
and the curtain, four knee-high
cubes delineated the corners of an
imaginary stage.
Seated in a wooden chair - the
only one in the room with arms -
was Lancaster-born Malcolm Tulip,
professor and ringmaster. He thrust
into the air a worn blue-handled
broom. "Who wants it?"
A student dressed in black
sweatpants and matching T-shirt
clambered to her feet and took the
broom from his hand. She pulled
on her false nose and worried at the
elasticwhichhadoncebeenwhitebut
was now turned beige with years of
flop sweat.
"You've never seen this stage
before," Tulip said, "but you need to
sweep it, and to sweep it well."
Nodding, she approached the
stage and paused at its invisible
threshold. She bowed her head,
briefly indistinguishable from a
woman in desperate prayer, and then
strode forward, broom in hand. She

had hardly walked four paces before
Tulip shouted: "Breathe!"
She opened her mouth with an
audible exhale. A few of her peers in
the audience chuckled with relief -
a laugh, yes, but not quite the sort a
clown is looling for.
Tulip turned to a student seated
on his right: "It's an acting habit of
hers," he said, "keeping her mouth
closed like that. It's not funny." The
students nodded. "She closes her
mouth, and she's dead."
"Next!"
Her place was taken by a young
woman whose white cable-knit
sweater billowed over a pair of dark
tights. She entered as her predeces-
sor did and began to sweep the floor,
slowly at first but with gathering
speed, until she was practically strik-
ing the ground with manic energy.
She glanced at the audience. Silence.
She slowed, made a few abstracted
sweeps at the floor, and was still,
looking from one end of the stage
to the other. Were this not an
improvisational exercise, one might
think she had forgotten her line.
Finally Tulip called out to her:
"Lots of thinking going on, right?"
She nodded. Most students are
hesitant to speak while wearing
"the nose," although at -this point
in their training, it's probably due
less to a deliberate stylistic choice
than to an uncertainty as to how
they ought to respond. Do they take
Tulip's direction as themselves, the
"actor"? Or as their clowns, hazy and
shapeless entities whose manner of
speech - if they even speak at all -
remains undetermined?Graduates of
Tulip's clown class speak uniformly
of not having created their clowns
but of having "found" them as if
they had emerged fully formed
from within themselves, costumed,
strutting, grimacing.
Tulip gestured for the student
to remove her nose. She did. "What
were you thinking about?" he asked.
"WhetherI was doing a good job?"
"Butyou weren't doing anything."

Helpless and looking rather
like a child unmasked while trick-
or-treating, the student shrugged
her shoulders.
"Look," Tulip said, rising from his
chair and taking the broom from her
hand. "You guys are making this too
complicated." He began to sweep.
"Just sweep the floor."
"It's simple." He turned on the
balls of his feet as he ended one
pass across the stage and began
another. "It's about the profundity,
the insignificance of the human
experience after the dropping of the
atom bomb."
An uncertain laugh floated up
from his audience, and he held up a
hand. "No - that's really how this
shit started. You sweep here, then
you sweep there, then you sweep
here, then you sweep there, then
you die." He surveyed the imaginary
dust-pile at his feet. "And that's it."
In the hour's closing minutes,
Tulip set down the broom at center-
stage and returned to his seat. He
gestured to a student waiting in the
wings, the last to go.
She pulled on her nose and took a
few hesitant steps forward. "A wild
broom!" Tulip whispered, narrating.
"It's abandoned! It's all alone! What
will it say?"
Playing along, the clown warily
tiptoed nearer its quarry. She leaned
over, bending at the waist to cock
an ear at the broom, and, after a
moment's silence, let out a guffaw as
if at a silent punchline.
"Did the broom tell you a
dirty joke?"
The clown nodded.
"I don't believe you!" Tulip cried.
"You didn't listen long enough to
hear anything!"
Holding up a finger, the clown
bent closer to the broom, listening.
She paused. And paused longer 4
still. Then she laughed, and so did
everyone else.

Overweight dads: An epidemic.
'Simpsons Guy'is
television history

SHOWTIME
Taking a break from all that sex stuff.
'Masters of Sex' both
ana..lytical and human

Groening and
MacFarlane come
together for special
episode
By DREW MARON
9 DailyArts Writer
How does one review history?
OK,let's be alittle less dramatic:
how do you review television
history?
Make no
mistake,
whatever you Famil Guy
thought of
the "Family "The Simpsons
Guy" Guy"'
and "The FOX
Simpsons"
crossover,
it is history. With "Family Guy,"
Seth MacFarlane shaped the
sense of humor of an entire
generation of adolescent boys.
With "The Simpsons," Matt
Groening and James L. Brooks
created a manifestationof popular
culture bglopging in the s sme
realm as The Beatles, Batman,
Shakespeare and the Bible.
So what happened when
the two shows met? The most
disturbing car-wash in the history
of mankind. Well, that and one of
the most fascinating episodes of
television in some time. Whatever
you might have thought about
the episode, you'd be lying if you
didn't at the very least find "The
Simpsons Guy" intriguing for
the simple reason that it saw the
melding of two distinct, albeit
radicallysuccessful, styles.

"The Simpsons" .has always
been a family show with a lot
of comedy while "Family Guy"
has always been a comedy about
a "family." You always found
yourself loving Homer andr the
rest of the Simpsons clan despite
their flaws, with the absurdity of
Springfield always planted firmly
in the realm of satire instead of
parody. We always got a sense
that "The Simpsons" could be us
and in fact, was us, despite the
ridiculousness ofits world.
"Family Guy" on the other
hand is sardonic, nihilistic,
offensive, over-the-top, rude
and just about the farthest thing
removed from reality. You'd never
in a million years want to be the
Griffins, let alone live anywhere
near them. But that's the point of
"Family Guy." It's a show meant to
be hated. It's the show that depicts
hilarious depravity while hiding
its cringe behind aknowingsmirk.
It's a show that will kill off one of
its main characters, resurrecthim
and then make fun of the audience
for falling for it.
In "The Simpsons Guy,"
we remai conected; tor the
Griffins aidtheirexperiences in
Springfield,andit'seasytoimagine
a good bit of "Simpsons" fans
crying out in anger that "Family
Guy" gets more of the spotlight.
However, the compromise does
work, having the main characters
of "Family Guy" but the setting
of Springfield, as many viewers
today might be more attached
to "Family Guy" than the aging
"Simpsons." However, the writers
chose wisely to focus solely on
the relationship between the two
families as opposed to tryingto fit

too much in one episode. Instead
we got some pretty solid scenes
that we've always wanted to see
(and two that no one -and I mean
no one - should ever have to see).
A lot of the humor of the
episode came from the contrast
between the more earnest and
admittedly innocent humor
of "The Simpsons," with the
knowledge that any second the
characters of "Family Guy" would
do something horrendous to it all.
When Stewie and Bart team up,
and Stewie planstogetrevenge on
Nelson the bully, you just knew it
would get outof hand anysecond.
Of course, that was also the fun
of the episode. It was admittedly
kind of cool to see Stewie take the
revenge on Nelson I'm sure a lotof
people have been wanting to see
for the last 24 years.
Another strong point, perhaps
the most fascinating of all the
episode, was the lawsuit of
Duff versus Pawtucket Ale. The
ensuing battle resolved every
"Simpsons" vs. "Family Guy"*
comment anyone has ever made
and it was extremely cathartic to
feel like both shows finally buried
the hatchet."
Both shows are staples of
animated comedy and both have
a special place in this reviewer's
heart. It's good to see them finally
be friends, after all of these years,
even if it is just for one hour of
TV. In the end, there have been
funnier episodes of "Family Guy"
and more well-written episodes
of "The Simpsons," but there was
only one episode that brought
them both together. No matter
how you look at it, that's pretty
special.

'Sleepy Hollow' returns

Second season
premiere lives up to
high expectations
By ALEXINTNER
DailyArts Writer
Spoilersfollowfor season one and
the season two premiere of "Sleepy
Hollow."Ifyou haven't seen it, head
over to Hulu
Plus and watch
it and then come
back and read sleepy
this review. It's
OK, I can wait. Hollow
"Sleepy Hol- Season Two
low" has lofty Premiere
expectations FOX
to meet in its
second season.
After a fun, dense and twisty first
season that ended on a fantas-
tic cliffhanger, the series has to
match the excellence it previously
set. It's unclear, going forward, if
the drama can maintain what it's
doing over a full 18-episode sea-
son, but it was a damn fun episode
of television, comparable to the
best of season one.
"Hollow" follows Lieutenant
Abigail Mills (Nicole Beharie, "42"
) and Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison,
"Parade's End") as they try to stop
Moloch, an evil demon who is
coming to earth to bring about the
apocalypse. The premiere picks up
after the cliffhanger, with Abbie
in purgatory and Ichabod bur-
ied alive by his son Henry (John
Noble, "Fringe").

FOX

Keep your head.
The premiere continues the
cuckoo-bananas storytelling that
the show patented in its first sea-
son, with the introduction of a
naked Benjamin Franklin. It also
spent the first 15 minutes on one
idea before pulling the rug out
from under the viewer. The pre-
miere starts out by saying that a
year had passed and everyone was
freed from where they were left.
However, afterthey figure out that
it was all a trick by Henry, they're
put back exactly where they were
at the end of season one.
The relationship between Mills
and Crane is the beating heart
of "Hollow"; the series doesn't
work without it. The storytell-
ing device in the premiere relied
upon the need to see the two of
them together (and the heartbreak
when they're torn apart after real-
izing the illusion). Beharie and
Mison have developed a strong
bond over the course of the show's
run. That allows the episode's pay-

off, with thetwo of them reuniting
in Purgatory, to work. They both
are able to heighten the emotion of
the scene.
The premiere also sets up some
ambitious storytelling for the rest
of the season. In the finale last year,
the writersintroduced the idea that
Henry is the second Horseman of
the Apocalypse: War. Featuring
a scenery-chewing performance
from Noble, the premiere ends
with Moloch giving Henry a magic
sword and telling him to unleash
war.Given that this season is18 epi-
sodes (five more than last season),
the show has a high degree of dif-
ficulty for what they're tryingto do.
This might mean that they'll lose
some of the tight storytelling that
made season one so much fun.
However, the show's writers
have proven that they have good
heads on their shoulders, and the
premiere hinted that this will be
another great season of "Sleepy
Hollow."

'Thinking Sex' to

contributions to

any further

Gayle Rubin, a professor
of Women's Studies and
Anthropology here at the
University of Michigan, has
produced work acclaimed in
all corners of the sexuality
studies field for its well-
informed historical and
theoretical interrogation of
the dategories of gender and
sexuality, among various
other and related subjects.
Thursday, a symposium
entitled "Thirty Years of
'Thinking Sex,"' taking its
name from Rubin's landmark
1984 essay of the same name,
will gather Rubin and five
other scholars to celebrate and
reflect on her impact on the
field.
It doesn'tgetusveryfarto say
that humans are sexual beings:
first we, need 'definitions of
sex and sexuality. Dating the
beginnings of sexuality studies
as a discipline is complicated in
all sorts of ways, as the work of
scholars from disparate fields
and traditions - feminism
and psychoanalytic theory,

just to name two historically
uneasy bedfellows, but
medical pathology, history
and anthropology as well -
converged to form what is now
institutionally recognized
in numerous university
departments.
For instance, the Gender
and Sexuality Studies
concentration at Brown
University states that it
"encourages students to
examine the complex ways
that 'differences' are produced
culturally, politically, and
epistemologically: sexual and
gender differences in concert
with differences that are
fundamental to the categories
of 'race' and ethnicity,
nationality, class, religion, and
so forth."
Generally, however, one can
point to the 1970s and 1980s as
a time when scholarly output
came to articulate some of the
central problems of human
sexuality on the discursive
level and as it materially
intersects with other political,
social and historical forces.
"There are certain things
you can get at thinking about
gender, but it's not the only
lens through which to see the
world. I don't think there's
a single set of categories
that works for everything,"
Rubin said, describing what
motivated her as a scholar to
broaden the scope of inquiry
beyond the then-available
tools and categories of
feminism, the medical field
or "high theory," to use her
phrase.
"There wasn't much in
the way of social science
or hunranities scholarship
on sex. It was an area that
seemed to me very importan t,
but you had to look around to
find tools to get at it," Rubin
discussed further.
In this sense, Rubin's
scholarship was genuinely
formative in the study of
sexuality as an academic
discipline and is continually

relevant within the academic
world of sexuality studies and
without.
To give an example of
Rubin's enduring relevance,
in a recent article in
the Chronicle of Higher
Education, Laurie Essig,
a professor of Sociology.
and Gender, Sexuality
and Feminist Studies at
Middlebury College, cites
"Thinking Sex" in her
discussion of legislation
concerning sexual assault,
consent and the concessions
that some feminists have
made to the racist and sexist
criminal justice system in
the effort to stamp out sexual
violence.
The historical account of
sexual studies put forward
here is skeletal at best and
does no justice to the richness
of the field in all its concern
with real-world problems of
oppression and itscommitment
to a world free of gender- and
sexuality-based violences.
This is not to say, however,
that its function is purely
critical; Rubin herself sees her
work as part of the effort to
ensure the heritage of vibrant
communities whose histories
would otherwise be lost. In a
review of "Deviations: A Gayle
Rubin Reader" in the. Times
of Higher Education, Rubin is
cited as saying, "Queer life is
full of examples of fabulous
explosions that left little or no
detectable trace... (Those) who
fail to secure the transmission
of their histories are doomed
to forget them."
To hear a more extensive
and more illuminating
discussion of this exciting
area of scholarship, then,
all are invited to attend this
Thursday's symposium in
honor of Professor Rubin's
foundational contributions to
the study of sexuality. (And
after the event there will be
an afterparty at \aut\ bar,
featuring Professor Rubin as
DJ).

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
Another week, another
literary-based
campaign for my
fellow bibliophiles and I to rel-
ish in. Last week marked the
American Library Association's
annual Banned Books Week,
an event that brings together
librarians, teachers and read-
ers to celebrate the freedom
to read, and call attention to
censorship.
Banned Books Week started
in 1982 as a response to an
explosion of challenges to
books in schools and libraries.
And thus Banned Books Week
came to join the 1984 Detroit
Tigers, John Hughes movies
and the destruction of disco as
the only good things to come
out of the 80s.
And if you think that book
banning is a thing of the past,
think again. In 2013, most
states had reported challenges:
Texas, Oregon and North
Carolina led the way with over
ten challenges each. In fact,
Texas had 114 book challenges
in total. Oh Texas, do you ever
turn down?
So why do people continue
to try to ban books? Well if you
can tune out the shrill criesof
"Won't somebody think of the
children!" the answer is the
same as it's always been. People
use censorship as a way of
maintaining and asserting their
own moral and/or ideological
view by condemning any chal-
lenge or critique of their posi-
tion that could pose a threat.
Basically, when you control
books, you control informa-
tion. Bonus points if you read
that last line like Newman from
Seinfeld.
Sometimes the reasons
given for a challenge are comi-
cally bizarre, specifically on
the grounds of occultism.
Excuse me if I think it a bit
far-fetched that dark religious
orders are trying to lure chil-
dren into depravity with works
such as "A Wrinkle in Time,"
"The Giver" and, of course,
everybody's favorite subtly-
promoting-satanism poster boy,
"Harry Potter." Never mind
that "Harry Potter" inspired in
an entire generation a love of
reading, or that the essential

point of the entire series is that
good conquers evil, and love is
more powerful than hate. No,
any form of magic, regardless
of its contextual basis, equals
an affiliation with those pesky
satanists (#evangelicalthought-
process).
Then there are the challeng-
es that are so painfully ironic,
they too are almost laughable.
"Fahrenheit 451," an entire
novel dedicated to exposing the
problematic nature of censor-
ship of dissent and book burn-
ing, has been challenged for
obscenity and for a description
of a Bible being burned. It's
a metaphor, you potato with
eyes! Dystopian novels, such as
"1984" and "Brave New World,"
are, in general, great fodder for
banning, as their anti-author-
itarian themes blatantly ques-
tion the status quo.
Of course, there are the book
challenges that are also down
right baffling. "The Wizard
of Oz" has been challenged
throughout the last century for
numerous reasons, including
for depicting women in strong
leadership roles. Dorothy tries
to lean-in and she gets banned?
Even "Anne Frank: The Dairy
of a Young Girl" was challenged
for some sexually explicit
detail. So the heartbreaking
and yet inspiring true story of a
girl who hid from the Nazis for
two-years and still believed in
the innate goodness of people
is tossed out because of a few
lines about sexual anatomy?
Don't mind me, I'll just be
continually banging my head
against the wall.
Now the truly dangerous
book challenges are the ones
that seem almost understand-
able. "The Da Vinci Code,"
"Fifty Shades of Grey," "Twi-
light":Are they god-awful?
Yes, most emphatically, yes. Is
reading any one of them akin
to drowning in a cesspool of
poorly written prose and ter-
ribly problematic characters
and themes? Again, yes. But
do they deserve to be banned?
No, because, as Noam Chomsky
said, "If we don't believe in
freedom of expression for peo-
ple we despise, we don't believe
in it at all." You got lucky this
time, Meyer.
The three most common rea-
sons for a book tobe challenged

are if it is sexually explicit,
contains offensive language or
is unsuited for the age group.
From our Puritan forefathers
to our loony lawmakers, Ameri-
cans love to lose their minds
over sex, namely by banning
works that even remotely touch
on the subject. And of course,
teenagers would never, ever
think about sex without direct
prodding from John Green,
that bespectacled scoundrel.
In fact, a book doesn't even
need to mention sex to get chal-
lenged for obscenity, as was the
case for "The Scarlet Letter."
Now look, I'm a pretty tolerant
person, but when someone goes
after Nathaniel Hawthorne,
well even I have my limits.
One of the most frequently
banned books is, I kid you not,
"Captain Underpants." Please,
if you ever feel the urge to
crusade against a children's
chapter book for its mention
of undergarments, go to your
mirror and take a long, hard
look at yourself. Even criti-
cally acclaimed works like Toni
Morrison's "The Bluest Eye"
and Alice Walker's "The Color
Purple" have been challenged
and subsequently banned for
offensive language.
The just-vague-enough claim
of a book being unsuited to age
group operates as both a catch-
all and a cop-out. It's the thing
a challenger claims when they,
don't have another leg to stand
on. What makes them quali-
fied to speak for an entire age
group they're not a part of and
realistically only have antidotal
information of said group to
draw from? Oh right, nothing.
If you don't want your chil-
dren exposed to certain themes
and thus certain books, fine. I
don't agree, but it's your life/
progeny. I'm not going to force
feed your children contro-
versial books in some sort of
Clockwork Orange-esque sce-
nario. But libraries and schools
aren't here to comfort your
ignorance. To deny someone
else a book based on your per-
sonal sensitivities is the height
of sanctimonious presumption.
In short, stop being atool, and
read banned books.

to Texas. To stop being a tool,

Antoine Fuqua's
action film fizzles
out in the end
By MAYANK MATHUR
DailyArts Writer
Robert McCall lives alone
in a dimly lit apartment that is
stocked with the bare necessi-
ties needed for
a very ordi-
nary, working
class life. He The
gets up in the
morning, eats Equalizer
his breakfast, Rave20and
goes to work, Quatity16
comes back
home and Columbia
calls it a day
after going out
for dinner. The daily routine is
as constant, and as mundane,
is it sounds. He never says it,
but you can tell that it wasn't
always like this for McCall -
there's something about the
way he walks, talks and reacts
to his surroundings - clearly,
he's not really the ordinary cit-
izen he so wants to be.
This much is evident. Direc-
tor Antoine Fuqua ("White
House Down") doesn't waste
time in setting the premise
for his latest film, "The Equal-
izer", starring Denzel Wash-
ington ("Flight"). It's clear
that McCall is going to bring

the house down by flipping his
shit at some point in the movie;
the question is - is the sudden
switch going to be impact-
ful enough, and can it sustain
itself throughout the length of
the movie?
McCall is forced to spring
back into action when a newly
formed acquaintance of his,
child prostitute Teri (Chloe
Grace Moretz, "Carrie") is
abducted and beaten up by her
employers. He can't stand by, he
has to do something, because
"Yougottabewhoyouarein this
world, right?" So about a good
third of the way into the movie,
he finally does what you've
been waiting for him to do -
beat the crap out of five Russian
pimps in 19 seconds. The scene
is great, and the switch from
an unassuming working class
citizen to a trained agent who
executes with metronomic effi-
ciency, although predictable, is
wonderfully executed. McCall
starts a war with the Russian
mafia, and there's no turning
back.
What this film needs more
than anything is a worthy vil-
lain to battle against McCall.
Washington cuts an imposing
figure even when he's dressed
in bland attire and is convinc-
ing as both the good-guy and
the ruthless special agent. For
a brief period of time, Fuqua
makes it seem as if he's given
you a villain that can really give

McCall a tough time. Teddy
(standard assassin name) (Mar-
ton Csokas, "Noah") is the
hit man assigned to take out
McCall and he really seems like
he could go toe-to-toe with our
hero. Even as he makes his first
appearance, you can picture
an incredible hand-to-hand
combat scene between the two
where you honestly cannot tell
which way it might go. Howev-
er, there's a lot of foreplay and
no real action. Fuqua chooses
a very, very long buildup to the
climax scene and just doesn't
deliver when it matters. There's
a good bit of tension between
hero and villain, but that ten-
sion is never really let out in an
explosive manner. It just kind of
fizzles out, and then the movie
ends.
"The Equalizer" isn't a bad
film but any means, but it just
isn't a very good one either. The
film doesn't build on its solid,
albeit slow start, and that's
where it breaks down. Fuqua
commits the fatal flow of not
setting up the film to anything
worthy of the set up itself. It's
as if you've been waiting for a
really long time for your late
night/early morning meal at
Pizza House. You've had a
great night, you're ready for
some food but when it comes
in, you realize they forgot the
cheese. You really, really need-
ed that, and it sucks that you
didn't get it.

PETITION
From Page 1A
firshtime inthe program's history.
CSG President Bobby Dishell,
a Public Policy senior, also issued
a statement Tuesday, echoing
similar sentiments to that of El-
Kiliani's petition regarding the
Athletic Department as a whole,
though not specifically endorsing
or objecting to Brandon's remov-
al. Dishell mentioned the his-
torically poor performance and
wrote that "CSG joins the voice
of students and their demand for
 managerial culpability."
However, Dishell said in an
interview that he has no defined
number of petition signers that
would indicate a student consen-
sus. He also said, to his knowl-
edge, that there is no resolution
yet drafted by any CSG assem-
bly members for consideration

dent ticket prices, a disappointing
home schedule and poor team
performance among his griev-
ances.
Students could be heard orga-
nizing chants among the group,
with "Fire Brandon," being the
most popular followed up by
"Fire Hoke," "Down with Dave"
and "Protect our Players," among
other sentiments. Other times,
the atmosphere seemed relatively
light, with students poking fun at
the administration and wonder-
ing aloud who they'd prefer as a
replacement coach.
At around 7 p.m., several stu-
dents convinced the group to
marci to the nearby University's
residence on South University
Avenue. Just before the protest
was scheduled to begin, Schlissel
released a statement addressing
the decisions made in the after-
math of Morris' injury, which
called for a review of the Athletic
Department's safety procedures.
"As the leader of our University
community, I want to express my
extreme disappointment in the
events surrounding the handling
of an on-field injury to one of our
football players, Shane Morris,"
the statement read. "The health
and safety of our entire student
community, including all of our
student-athletes, is my most
important responsibility as uni-
versity president."
Neither Schlissel nor any other
University administrators were
present at the protest.
LSA junior Audrey Cords said

at tonight's meeting. Dishell
said, as far as he knows, CSG has
never before formally requested
the removal of any faculty or
staff members from the Univer-
sity. Dishell added that he hasn't
decided if he will be signing the
petition himself.
CSG has worked closely with
the Athletic Department over the
past year. Following an unpopu-
lar football student ticket policy
change last year, CSG worked to
establish a new policy based on
attendance. Additionally, CSG
conducted its own investiga-
tion last spring into the Athletic
Department's handling of the
permanent separation of former
Michigan kicker Brendan Gib-
bons for sexual misconduct.
Dishell said many students still
feel like "pawns," citing rising
prices for tickets and concessions,
and the injury of Shane Morris
was part of a "tipping-point" after

a long stretch of poor regard for
University students, athletes or
not.
"If you ask alumni ... they're
still big supporters of Michigan
football, Michigan football still
largely shaped their experience
and they still view it very posi-
tively, and I think that's just not
there anymore," he said. "That's
a combination of the safety of the
students, a combination of how
the students are being treated, it's
a combination of students being
priced-outofbeingable to partici-
pate in this."
Dishell said anyone who still
has a unique name and password
for the University is able to log on
to and sign the petition. El-Kilani
said he knows of several alumni
who have already signed.
Additionally, commenters on
MGoBlog.com have been organiz-
ing a "Fire Dave Brandon" rally on
the Diag Tuesday evening at 6.p.m.


she decided to come to the protest
because she's completely dissatis-
fied withher recentfootball expe-
rience.
"For the past two years, Dave
Brandon has been treating stu-
dents terribly," she said. "Peo-
ple say that only students from
wealthy families go to games
anymore, and I had to pay $295
to see a crappy football schedule
and results. It's not the Michigan
football I grew up with, I've been
coming to games since I was the
age of three and now that I'm a
student, I should be enjoying it
more than ever and it's been- the
worst experience."
She added that in addition to
the lackluster home schedule,
she finds it hard to get excited
about football Saturdays when
the team has a reputation for not
performing well. She said the cur-
rent situation leaves little time for
improvement, and that the only
solution is to replace Brandon and.
Hoke.
"I think that we need a coach-
ing staff that's actually going to
get players outthere who are actu-
ally going to get results. We've
been losing game after game and
the playing is terrible," she said.
"Even those games where we're
losing and then have a comeback
are gone, so I definitely think we
need a new coach and a new ath-
letic director."
Cords emphasized that coming
to University football games is a
family tradition she's grown up
with and not ready to give up.
"It's not just football," she said.
Cords said she was proud to
participate in the protest, but
wishes it had been a little more

organized from the beginning.
"I liked how we walked to the
president's house, I think that's
very symbolic even though he's
not here," she said. "At first I real-
ly didn'tknow what to expect, but
we had helicopters, we had cam-
eras, we had news, and I feel like
people heard us."
Business graduate student
Nathan Falstad joined the protest
after seeing news crews and heli-
copters occupying the campus area.
"It's easy to be down when
we're not doing well, and most
people are frustrated with Dave
Brandon," he said. "He hasn't
done a great job and he's upset a
lot of people, from alumni and
season ticket holders to students
with raising the prices."
He agreed that even if Bran-
don comes forward or develops a.
plan to turnithe programi around,
it might be time to look at-a new
Athletic Director.
"Especially because we have
a new president now, I think it
mightbe more likely that it'll hap-
pen," he said.
The protest was even large -
and loud enough - to attract the
.attention of students who don't
consider themselves big sports
fans. Some students, like LSA
freshman Jimmy Sorrells, were
not completely familiar with the
protest's aims, but still joined the
rally. He said he wasn't disap-
pointed.
"I didn't know much about
Dave Brandon because I just
became a Michigan fan this year,
but I'm disappointed with the
team too and can see why people
are mad," he said. "We're 2-3 and
only getting worse."

Public Policy senior Craig Kaplan rallies for President Mark $chlissel to fire Athletic Director Dave Brandon Tuesday
Senior akes leadership role
at 'Fire Brandon protest

Student leads
rally to University
President's house
ByALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSportsEditor
For a while, Monday after-
noon's protest to fire Athletic
Director Dave Brandon wasn't
very much of one at all.
Yes, hundreds of people
arrived at the diag for the 6 p.m.
start time. Yes, several people
brought posters criticizing the
University's handling of sopho-
more quarterback Shane Mor-
ris' concussion suffered in the
fourth quarter of the football
team's loss to Minnesota on
Saturday. And yes, there were
quite a few chants to "fire Bran-
don."
But for the most part, the stu-
dents milled around the Diag as
reporters from numerous local
and national outlets took pho-
tos and conducted interviews.
Then, Public Policy senior
Craig Kaplan and a group of
others had an idea: Move the

protest to University President
Mark Schlissel's house nearby
on South University Avenue.
And then it really got interest-
ing.
Kaplan marched up the steps
of Schlissel's residence with
a megaphone and began to
address his peers.
"I love this University," he
yelled. "I'love this football team.
I love our sports. I do not love
Dave Brandon.
"I am angry, as a student,
as a fan, as a lover of Michigan
football. I'm pissed. I am upset
at how we have been treated, at
our record and at the absolute
mismanagement of this school's
Athletic Department under
Dave Brandon.
"The fact that this rally is nec-
essary - it says enough that the
student body is upset enough to
come together like this as a uni-
fied front to make changes that
need to be made.
"' asns proudof Michigan's his-
tory. I am proud of Bo Schem-
bechler. I am proud of all the
Michigan football players, bas-
ketball players, athletic directors
and the people that come before

us. I am proud of our history. I
am not proud of Dave Brandon
being part ofthat history.
"Come tonight, Dave Brandon
should no longer be the Athletic
Director of the University of
Michigan."
The crowd responded with
its loudest chorus of the night of
"Down with Dave."
Schlissel, who sent a release
to media earlier Tuesday apolo-
gizing for the Athletic Depart-
ment's handling of Morris'
concussion; did not make an
appearance at the rally.
A University police officer
standing on Schlissel's lawn said
he did not interfere with the
demonstration because it was
conducted peacefully.
But the protest wouldn't have
amounted for much of anything
if not for Kaplan's strong words.
"I've been a Michigan fan my
entire life," he said. "Michi-
gan has a special place in my
heart. The fact that it has been
mismanaged like this, it really
hurts me deeply as a student,
as a fan - just as a person that
cares about this state and cares
about this University."

CONGRESSMAN
From Page 1A
Morris' case is a "particularly
egregious example" of a player's
health being jeopardized. Spe-
cifically, Pascrell knew a student
athlete who lost his life after pre-
maturely returning to the field
following an in-game head injury,
and thus was inspired to take
action.
Pascrell also leads the Con-
gressional Brain Injury Task
Force and works to raise aware-
ness about concussions and other

traumas, for both soldiers and
student athletes. Pietrykoski said
getting answers regarding Mor-
ris' situation is a "big priority" for
the congressman, emphasizing
that concussions are always seri-
ous injuries.
"I strongly urge you to inves-
tigate the circumstances sur-
rounding Shane Morris's injury
and the decision to return him to
play," Pascrell wrote. "Addition',
ally, Iask that you reexamine the
protocols in place and determine
what changes can be made to
improve them. I also urge you to
establish penalties for violations

of concussion protocols. Every
concussion is brain damage and
must be diagnosed and treated
by appropriate medical per-
sonnel, who prioritize players'
health, safety, and well-being."
Pietrykoski added that since
the letter was sent today, Pascrell
will wait for Delany to respond
before making any further deci-
sions. However, he said he's hop-
ing the investigation will result
in a reevaluation of protocols
regarding situations like Mor-
ris', as well as establishing con-
sequences for those who violate
those protocols in the future.

Irish government
could bolster funds,
lose business-
friendly reputation
BRUSSELS (AP) - Apple
risks havingto repay Ireland tax
rebates worth billions of dol-
lars after the European Union's
competition watchdog said
Tuesday the company appears.
to be benefiting from illegal tax
deals there.
In a preliminary report into
the company's overseas tax
practices, the 28-nation bloc's
executive Commission said the
low tax treatment Ireland is
granting Apple counts as state
aid and could be illegal under
EU law.
If the finding is confirmed,
Apple Inc. could face a huge
repayment bill because it fun-
nels the bulk of its international
sales 'through subsidiaries in
Ireland.
To keep market competition
fair, the EUforbidsgovernments
from helping individual compa-
nies. The EU first announced
the tax probe in June, also tar-
geting coffee chain Starbucks
and others as part of a crack-
down on multinationals exploit-
ing tax loopholes.
The EU Commission is now
requesting further documents
from Ireland before making
a legally binding decision on
whether the rebate granted
to Apple is illegal and must be
recouped, wholly or partially.
The EU probe focuses on
exaggerated transfer pricing,
where one part of a company
charges another part an inflated
price for goods or services to
shift profits to low-tax locations.
If Apple had to repay some
taxes, the money wouldcome as
a windfall to Irish state coffers.

However, fearful of losing its
reputation as a business-friend-
ly country with low corporate
taxes, the Irish government is
adamant that no EU rules have
been breached.
The Commission said the tax
deals Ireland struck with Apple
in 1991 and in 2007 show "sever-
al inconsistencies" and may not
comply with international taxa-
tion standards. The Brussels-
based executive body also was
critical of the fact that Apple's
applicable tax rate appears to
have been the result of "a nego-
tiation rather than a pricing
methodology" which a "pru-
dent, independent" tax author-
ity should not have accepted.
The Commission added
documents provided by Irish
authorities, including minutes
of meetings with Apple's tax
advisers, fail to providea consis-
tent explanation for the agreed
tax rates. It did not publish an
estimate for Apple's effective
tax rate in Ireland.
Apple maintains it has not
received a favorable treatment
in Ireland.
"We're subject to the same
tax laws as the countless other
companies who do business in
Ireland," the company said in
an emailed statement. "Apple
has received no selective treat-
ment from Irish officials over
the years."
The company added that
its tax payments to Ireland
increased tenfold since it
launched its first iPhone in 2007.
In the statement, Apple also said
that on a global level, "compre-
hensive corporate tax reform is
badly needed."
Apple's tax practices have
also attracted scrutiny in the
United States, where a -Senate
Committee last year published a
scathing report on the Cuperti-
no-based firm's tax schemes.

The report held up Apple as
an example of legal tax avoid-
ance made possible by the
complicated U.S. tax code, esti-
mating the firm avoided at least
$3.5 billion in U.S. federal taxes
in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by
usingits tax strategy.
Democratic Senator Carl
Levin, chairman of the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, said Tuesday the
EU probe underscores the need
to close loopholes that "allow
Apple-type gimmicks whose
sole purpose is to avoid paying
U.S. taxes."
"Apple developed its crown
jewels - lucrative intellectual
property - in the United States,
used a tax loophole to shift the
profits ... offshore to avoid pay-
ing U.S. taxes, then boosted its
profits through a sweetheart
deal with the Irish govern-
ment," he said.
Levin added Apple's Irish
tax rate "has no rational basis"
because it is the result of what
Ireland accepted when threat-
ened with job losses.
The company currently
employs some 4,000 people in
Cork, Ireland.
Apple - one of the world's
most valuable and profitable
firms - sat on some $164 billion
in cash and cash equivalents,
with $138 billion stashed away
in foreign subsidiaries, accord-
ing to its latest quarterly report
in June. The company estimated
its effective U.S. tax rate is 26.1
percent, as opposed to the statu-
tory U.S. rate of 35 percent, pri-
marily because of undistributed
foreign earnings.
"A substantial portion" of
those foreign earnings was gen-
eratedby subsidiaries organized
in Ireland, Apple said in the reg-
ulatory filing, adding that "such
earnings are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested outside

first Big Ten win
By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan volleyball team
looked rusty at times, but it took
3-of-4 sets to win its first Big
- Ten match of the season Monday
against Michigan State.
The Wolverines won the final
two setsto seal the victory.
Setter Lexi Dannemiller came
out firing from the service line
in the first set, single-handedly
putting the Wolverines up 2-0
after forcing Michigan State
into back-to-back service return
errors. The senior showed no
jitters at Crisler Center in her first
start of the season.
The Spartans recovered from
the early hole, but neither team
gained momentum over the first
half of the set. A sharp kill from
junior middle-back Krystalyn
Goode went untouched onto the
Michigan State court, setting off
what ended up being the spark
the Wolverines needed.

strong, Michigan managed to "The bottom line is that I
side out quickly on multiple thought we were playing right

with them," Rosen said.
A series of ill-timed errors
left Dannemiller and her team
down 10-5 early in the third set
as Michigan struggled to keep up
with the high-powered Spartan
offense led by sophomore outside
hitter Chloe Reinig.
It was there in the third set
that Dannemiller showed the
spectators in Crisler that she was
not just a setter.
"She's an unbelievable
volleyball player," Rosen said.
"She's a great defender, she's a
great server, she's even a great
attacker."
The Wolverines' setter led
her team with a total of 17 digs,
many of which came vitally in
the third set.
Having finally clawed
their way out of the deficit,
Dannemiller and her team made
superior shot selections, utilizing
both tips and full swings to close
the third set, 26-24.
The fourth set was
chnearezed by firce

defense on both sides of the
net. Junior Tiffany Morales
joined Dannemiller to help the
Wolverines keep the game close
at 7-7 early on.
The energy in Crisler escalated
as the game wore on, culminating
after Michigan made the score
20-16, only five points away from
victory. A decisive combination
from Dannemiller to freshman
Claire Kieffer-Wright ended in a
kill and clinched the win.
Rosen credited the win
to the team as a whole, but
acknowledged Dannemiller's
impact.
"Lexi is a very experienced
senior, not only in how she
delivers the ball but her
personality on the court," he said.
"You can see her being a coach on
the floor."
Dannemiller was welcomed
back whole-heartedly, and
Rosen will surely look forward
to seeing more of her "veteran
leadership" throughout the rest
of the seasonn.

8B Wednesday October1 2014 The Statement
THE VISUAL STATEMENT: SHOT FROM THE HEAD

he student was sitting on a bench beside North Quad Resi-
dence Hall. As I approached, standing over her to make a
photograph, she abruptly rose, leaving her books and purse
behind her, and ran off. Later she would claim that she thought the
pinhole camera I wore, tied to my skull by twine, was a bomb. This
was the early stage of testing outa new kind of camera I have now
completed: one that you don't use with your hands, and one that
is anything but discreet, a "jaw-operated pinhole camera." With
the device functioning, I packed up and headed to New York City,
where I had a month long class - and where I planned on experi-
menting with a rather obtrusive type of street photography.
Based on the reactions I got on the street after testing the new
pinhole camera inAnn Arbor, I was apprehensive about using it in
New York City - a place where, as one of my advisors pointed out,
was once "literally under attack." However, as I began affixing the
handmade pinhole camera (a matchbox body with an aluminum
can aperture) to my head, I realized that ina city as avant-garde as
New York, literally no one gave a damn about what I was wearing
on my head. In fact, I ended up moving more stealthily asa street
photographer because it seemed when I put the device on, I looked
strange enough to fall into the "don't look at him even once; he is
crazy" category. You see, in New York, the unusual are ignored;
people are too busy to honor their presence unless they can create
"something" out of them.
In this case, I made something out of the normal: people in tran-
sit, signs, people on cell phones. Most did not even notice me, eras-
ing off-putting images from their minds.

Personal Statement: What she left behind
by Aleah Douglas Khavari

my first time:,studying abroad by ruby wallau

Even from a young age, I have
always romanticized a life spent
abroad. I spent hours mesmerized
by the glossy pages of National Geo-
graphic, my walls were adorned
with maps of other countries and I
have at different times attempted to
learn French, Spanish and Japanese
(with little success). I would listen
to my father's stories of studying
abroad or see my mom jet off to
India with her boyfriend, and tell
myself that my time would come;
one day the collection of travel
books sitting on my shelves would
become useful. Finally, my time did
come when I decided that the sum-
mer before my junior year of col-
lege was the perfect time to study
abroad and that Morocco would
be the perfect location, since I was
studying Arabic.
I was not worried about the trav-
el logistics. I was a frequent flyer
since the age of 11 when I would
lead my younger brother through
airports all across the country to
make our yearly trip to visit our
father in Hawaii. It didn't matter
that I didn't know anyone else in
the Morocco program; I had a taxi

that was
going to pick
me up at the
airport and
I believed
that every-.
thing else
would fall
into place
after that.
All of my life
I was confi-
dent that I
could make
an easy
transition
into a life
spent traips-
ing across
the globe -
which made
the anxiety I ILLUS
felt boarding my flight to Morocco
so surprising and foreign. For the
first time in my life I felt homesick
- even before I got onto my plane.
Upon arriving in Fes, I got into
a taxi and promptly forgot how to
speak any Arabic. The sights I saw
out the window were nothing like
the photos in my travelguides. I was
introduced to
my host father,
who grabbed
IZmy hand and
pulled me into
ongoing traf-
fic to bring
A me to my new
home, where I
realized I was
unable to com-
municate with
any of my new
family. After
a whirlwind
day of travel-
ing, I sat down
on my bed and
realized that
maybe I had
taken too large

of a leap.
My first trip out alone the next
day was met with lost turns, heat
exhaustion and a permanent feel-
ing of being drastically out of place
and alone. The next day I Skyped
my father to tell him that I wasn't
sure I could do seven more weeks.
Through heaving sobs I felt like a
failure - where had that indepen-
dent 11-year-old gone?
Sevenweeks later, after spending
Ramadan with a Moroccan family,
camping overnight in the Sahara
desert, accidentally drinking tea
with the cast of an Anthony Bour-
dain episode, and receiving help
from an orange seller after hav-
ing thrown up from dehydration,
I realized I no longer wanted to
leave the country that hadbecome
my new home. I could have chosen
to study abroad in a country with
my classmates or a country where
I wouldn't have felt so linguisti-
cally and culturally isolated, but
Morocco taught me that I had a
lot more courage than I ever knew,
and perhaps my dreamswere not as
unachievable as I once believed.

In 1937, at age 25, my grandmoth-
er fled Peiping, China after the Jap-
anese Invasion, escaping by foot, ox
cart, boat and train, through cities
in lockdown and bombed-out coun-
tryside, spurred by the fear of never
reaching her final destination:
Kansu district, China. She had left
her career as curator of Oriental Art
at the University of Michigan and
traveled by ship to Peiping to study
Chinese textiles. Nine months after
her arrival, when the Japanese
attacked China, she ignored the
United States Embassy's evacuation
orders and traveled instead to the
Kansu district in the innermost
part of the country to discover
its rare ancient tapestries. What
she hoped would be a explora-
tion of art and culture became a
brutal three-month journey that
shaped the rest of her life. Whens
she returned to Ann Arbor, using
journal entries and her still-
sharp memories of China's land-=
scape, she drafted a non-fiction
manuscript. "The Height of a
Mountain," her 450-page finalZ
draft, won the 1939 Hopwood
Award for non-fiction. Preserved
in the Special Collections Library
at the Hatcher Graduate Library,
it has outlived my grandmother and
exists to tell the story she cannot.
I sit at a desk in the Special Col-
lections reading room, waiting for
the librarian to return from their
archives with my grandmother's
manuscript. Sunlight pools on the
empty desks that surround me.
Here on the eighth floor, I can see
all of campus, my home of three
years, the tips of brick University
buildings, the top of the bell tower,
the expanse of the Michigan stadi-
um, declaring its spirit with a large
block 'M.' After a few minutes, the
librarian approaches my desk and
sets a silver-bound manuscript in
front of me. I take a breath and open
to the first page. I read and re-read
the words stamped on the page. The
Height ofa Mountain by Barbara W.
Tinker. Seeing my grandmother's
name in crisp ink, I feel as if we are
meeting for the first time.
My grandmother died when I
was two. Everything I know of her,
I know from stories. When I was
younger, I learned that she, a white
woman, married my grandfather,
a Black man, at a time when inter-
racial marriage was illegal in 27
states. They met in a library and

connected over their love of poet-
ry. They were determined to stay
together, despite the intolerance
and violence that targeted interra-
cial couples. From my father's sto-
ries, I knew my grandmother taught
English to highschoolersby day and
crafted works of fiction by night.
She demonstrated unfailing kind-
ness to most, saving a fierce tongue
for racists and silent bystanders.
She struggled with money manage-
ment. She took her children to the
library every week. I knew that she
turned a blind eye to my grandfa-

the way. Other days, s

memorized the curl of her dark
hair, turned white with age, swept
in a chignon at the nape of her neck.
Her lips, always pressed together,
the corners barely lifted in a smile.
Her thin nose. Translucent skin.
And her eyes - my eyes - hazel,
rimmed by a band of dark green.
These images flood my mind as
I flip to the second page. Here, she
has typed a Chinese proverb:
"You can never know the height
of a mountain until you have
climbed it."
With that in mind, I turn to the
first chapter and begin to read.
Her tale began with a choice:
faced with the invasion of the
Japanese army and a mandatory
evacuation notice, my grandmother
elected to disobey the warning and
escape to the interior of China to
pursue her studies. Her 1,500-mile
journey took her through rural vil-
lages and cities in danger, hiking
up mountains and rowing across
rivers in tin canoes. Some days, she
walked for miles on end, finding no

And I'll have my entire life for that.

6B Wednesda October 1 2014 // The Statement
More than just a soundtrack: The music behind video games
by Amrutha Sivakumar

. Â±

the thought bubble

From three-dimensional gameplay to
motion-detection, video games are on the
move to enhance your recreational experi-
ence. Whatsome people may not realize, how-
ever, is that what they're hearing while they
play is evolving all the time too. Video game
music is a world of its own - just ask School
of Music, Theatre & Dance Lecturer Matthew
Thompson.
By introducing students of all academic
and musical backgrounds to the concepts that
underlie the conception and production of
game tunes, Thompson's new course "Video
Game Music,"has created alens through video
games that can be musically appreciated. The
course introduces students to the 50-year
history of music in video games, eventually
equippingstudents with the skills needed to
composetheir owngame sounds.
Thompson, in an interview with The
Michigan Daily, said a professional game
composer's goal is to make the music essen-
tial to the game play while making sure
players feel engaged with the sounds.
"Suppose you're walking through a maze
and a bass comes in, keep going the right way
and then a drumcomes in,keep goingthe right
way and there's some strings that come in," he
envisioned. "You're getting this aural rein-
forcement very subtly while you're complet-
ing this task and that you're doing something
W right."
Going on to describe the stochastic process-
es behind a person's video game experience,
Thompson started singing out how a generic
cheery game backdrop might change into a
minor key or come to a finish as a player loses
a life or dies. On the other hand, a success in
the game might result in faster victory music.
"The audio choice is going tobe determined
by player decision, so that's out of your hands.
It's totally opposite from how music usually is.
You have to compose the music in a way that
it can go to any place depending on what's
needed."
Thompson said the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance often looks for ways to offer
music classes to non-music majors due to the
broad appeal of music appreciation classes.
Teaching more technical terms - such as tone,
dominant and form - could be more compre-
hensible to students when taught with video
games as the reference point. The Michigan
Daily speculated in 2001 that ifa random stu-
dent were asked to sing the Super Mario Bros.
theme song, they would be likely to know
every note.
"I've always played games since I was a
kid," Thompson said. "The music is so repeti-
tive, and so the plus as a teacher is that those
stuff has been drilled into people's brains,
unlike a Beethoven Symphony."
For University alum Jen Remington, the
goal was always to graduate from the Univer-
sity s Performing Arts Technology program
and go into scoring film music in L.A. But after
serving as an assistant to several composers

and building up music industry connections,
she found herself a place in the composition of
video game music.
"I had such a positive experience working
for other composers that I learned a lot, things
that I never knew," she said. "You can learn a
lot from things online, books and YouTube,
but there's nothing better than being an
apprentice to
same-
body."
The
big-
.- -

gest
difference
between scor-
ing music for
film and for
video games is
the duration of
the composition
and the way video ILLUSTRATION BY
game music has to
be composed to loop. For Remington, the big-
gest difficulty in adapting to the style of video
game composition was that the ending of the
piece had to be able to seamlessly connect to
the beginning without hearing a "click or a
pop.',
Remington said all ofher contracts had been
on a work-for-hire basis. Though she had tried
to negotiate royalties for her compositions in
the past, Remington said she had learned that
it wasn't like the industry to offer musicians a
percentage of the games' revenues.
"Video games make a lot of their sales
within the first three months, and then the
sales die out. Film and TV plan reruns and go
into syndication, and you can get royalties for
years and years," she explained. "Because the
way video games are sold, I think it's smarter
forthemtokeep theirmoney- that's the main
difference."
Despite a growing video game culture
among University arts and music students,
Wolverine Soft, a student organization dedi-
cated to growinggame development culture at
the University, has found it difficult to keep a
steady inflow of musicians into the club.
The coding process typically takes longer
than the time required for composition, Engi-
neering senior Austin Yarger, president of
Wolverine Soft, said, which caused some stu-

dent musicians to lose interest in the process.
He estimates that there are currently three to
eight active musicians in Wolverine Soft.
While Silicon Valley gaming companies
traditionally have long pre-production ses-
sions where artists draw up extensive blue-
prints to convince executives to invest in
a two to three-year game creation
process, University games have
shorter turnovers, Yarger
explained.
In 48-hour "game
jams," groups
of four - tra-
ditionally'
made up
of two
engineers,
an artist and
a musician
- spend a few
hours concep-
tualizing a video
game idea that is
unique, fun and
interesting. As
the engineers code
the initial proto-
types, the artists and musi-
cians work simultaneously
to draw concept pieces and
create game's sound.
"It is unfortunately a
struggle," Yarger said
of recruiting arts and
MAGG I E MILLER music students into Wol-
verine Soft. "When you think
of video games you think of how visual they
can be and how there's a need for those stu-
dents, typically we have the need for arts and
music students."
Mark Maratea, senior engineer at Electron-
ic Arts, one of the world's'largest video game
publishers, and university recruiter, said the
EA recruiting team was actively looking for
highly qualified musicians from the Univer-
sity to enter their workforce. For these posi-
tions, Maratea said a musician's application
should include a portfolio and a demo reel
demonstrating their ability to create a variety
of sounds.
"For most traditional games that is a sound
effect and music based thing, they will author
their own sound, usually in a small studio
with drums and guitars, and they will track
the soundtrack and the sound effects live,"
he described. "They will monkey with things,
and they will record the voice-over tracks and
give the audio direction."
One of Wolverine Soft's leading missions is
to increase a student's ability to be placed in
the video game industry. By bringing in large
corporation such as Lizard Entertainment and
EA to their mass meetings and campus career
fairs,Wolverine Soft has been able to place one
to three students into the video game industry
each year.

"We definitely try and get those companies
to come in and look at our Michigan engineers,
Michigan artists, designers and musicians,"
Yarger said. "It's definitely very competitive
though, like it is in Hollywood or any form
of entertainment, but we have had successful
placements. I think the takeaway is that it is
very competitive but still possible."
Remington, who graduated in 2000 not
long after the program was first offered to
music concentrators, commended PAT for its
"avant garde" take on music education and its
interdisciplinary courses. Her now-husband,
who also graduated from PAT, was able to use
his broad PAT education to secure a job in the
film industry when record label jobs were hard
to come by.
Despite the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance's focus on more mainstream music
forms, Thompson said he believed that study-
ing many of the University's classical music
options was not wasted when a student decid-
ed to pursue an alternative industry upon
graduation - citing an example of how study-
ing Shakespeare could help theatre majors
when they auditioned for shows such as Sat-
urday Night Live.
"We understand that multimedia and
music is a path going forward," Thompson
explained. "To turn a blind eye to it, nobody
wants to do that. Could we have more modern
classes? Yes. Are we talking about that kind of
stuff? Yes. "
Janet Rarick, associate professor of music
career development at Rice University, cur-
rently administers several courses at the
Shepherd School of Music that enhance music
students' career development early in their
collegiate career. She said she believed that
one reason many music school students find
it difficult to discover alternative careers in
music is because of their lack of career focus.
"It's 'I've got to be really, really good and
I don't have time to deal with that right now.
I've got to learn my music and I've got to prac-
tice,' " she explained. "Students graduate, and
winning a job in an orchestra is very difficult
at this point. For most people it's a long road,
and it's very expensive."
On the other hand, while institutions such
as Carnegie Hall have begun to offer fellow-
ships and programs in career development,
Rarick said these programs are also very com-
petitive.
"If you're going to do something on an
alternative.basis, you're basically starting a
small business," she said. "There isn't the kind
of framework that science and industry has
for students, we don't have that in the music
world. It's not built into the industry."
"The successful people are the people in
alternative kind of ventures who are able to
see where there is a need for something, and
I think this is crucial," Rarick stressed. "Yor
have to see what is missing in our current arts
environment and does that interest you to try
to fill that void."

"I'm a mechanical engineer, but for now I'm staying home with the baby. I
love being a stay-at-home mom. I wouldn't change that for nothing."
-ANN ARBOR RESIDENT ELIZABETH COLON WITH ARMANDO COLON

on the record
"It is a critical lesson to us about how vigilant and
disciplined we must always be to ensure student-athlete
safety. As president, I will take all necessary steps to
make sure that occurs and to enforce the necessary
accountability for our success in this regard.'
- President MARK SCHLISSEL, in a press release regarding
Quarterback Shane Morris, who was played in thegame against
Minnesota this past Saturday, despite his mild concussion.
"In my judgment, there was a serious lack of
communication that led to confusion on the sideline.
Unfortunately, this confusion created a circumstance
that was not in the best interest of one of our student-
athletes."
- Athletic Director DAVE BRANDON, in a 1 a.m.press release,
also regarding Michigan quarterback Shane Morris.
"Although a small nation, it can provide a great
contribution with its model for religious tolerance
and coexistence and of accepting the others who are
different!"

League is no doubt one of
the biggest games on cam-
pus, but Michigan's Super
Smash Bros. community is
known as one of the big-
gest collegiate scenes in
the world, with hundreds
of active players, biweekly
tournaments, and a wel-
coming weekly venue: the
Duderstadt center. The
group is mainly organized
through its Facebook group,
"Michigan Melee," coor-
dinated by Michigan alum
Robin Harn.
Harn graduated from
Michigan in 2013, but he's
still the University's Smash
ringleader. Today, he's
organizing "The Big House
4," a national Super Smash
Bros. tournament taking
place in Romulus, MI, with
over 500 attendees. Harn
reckons the success of the
group's events is due to the
friendliness of the group to
new players.
"When people without
experience go to tourna-
ments, they're usually
afraid of a few things, like
the social stigma of tourna- Students compet

he said.
"But people understand that there are
going to be new players, and that it doesn't
matter if people don't know how to do
advanced techniques; they're just another
part of a big family."
Super Smash Bros. Melee, by far the most
popular Smash game to play competitively,
is now 13 years old. For many players, it's
getting tougher to organize events and
tournaments because competitive Melee
play requires old-school CRT televisions,
a rare find now that HD televisions have
completely overtaken the market. Melee
also lacks online play, meaning players
must seek out real-life interaction in order
to play competitively. This isn't necessarily
a bad thing, though - Harn credits the lack
of online play as a highly positive benefit to
the Smash scene.
"If you look at other games like 'League
of Legends' and 'Starcraft,' their online
communities can be toxic sometimes. And
if you look at Melee, there's none of that
because you can't hide behind a computer
screen. You have to go to the tournaments
and meet people... Smash is by far the most
friendly for new players," Harn said.
Additionally, Harn noted that the Smash
community is so friendly that he can reach
out to players across the nation.
"If I need graphic design done, I know a

a guy. If I need housing, I'm never going to
pay for housing on a random trip, anywhere
in the United States ever again. I'm going to

The social appeal of collegiate eSports
is clear. Both Huang and Harn attested to
the positive community and the rewarding
networking that comes with it. However,
there is one noticeable caveat that comes
with the accepting nature of these commu-
nities - the hardcore gaming scene is over-
whelmingly male. At a Friday night Smash.
event, only one girl was in attendance. Yet,
Lisa Nakamura, University Screen Arts and
Cultures professor, says that this disparity
is slowly changing.
"I've never taught a video game class
that had very many women at all. But as
time has gone on, I've gotten more," she
said.
Professor Nakamura researches Digital
Game Studies, as well as Asian American
studies, Digital Media Theory, and Race
and Gender in New Media.
She addressed the gendered differenc-
es in different categories of video games,
including First-Person Shooter games, and
Role-Playing Games.
"It's interesting, I ask people, 'Are you
a gamer?' and most of the men say yes;
almost all of the women say no. And then
I ask, 'Well, how many of you play 'Candy
Crush?' ... and that's everyone," Nakamura

said. "So women tend to view themselves
not as gainers unless they're playing FPS
games, or even RPGs... The disparity really
is a gendered one," she said.
So what's the problem? Why aren't more
women involved in "hardcore" gaming and
eSports? Nakamura says it's due to the fact
that the majority of game developers are
male.
"Not very many women make games.
When you make video game storylines
or animations, what people tend to do is
copy things they admire; they copy things
that impress them or move them in some
way," Nakamura said. "Because the devel-
oper culture is so male, you get these same
images over and over again, because people
can't really think outside what their canon
is. The indie canon is different, because
there are more women in it."
The gender disparity in the hardcore
gaming scene is changing. One thing still
isn't clear, though: why is competitive gam-
ing so big in college? Why now? Why not in
high school, when gainers have less respon-
sibilities?
"Maybe it has something to do with the
fact that you're no longer living with your
parents," guesses Julia G. Raz, a Rackham
student. Raz is a Communications graduate
student who has been studying games aca-
demically since 2008.
"Your parents might have given you a
hard time about spending so much time

playing video games and not focusing on
your schoolwork, and now you have the
opportunity to spend just as much of your
free time as you want playing these games.
You no longer have anyone looking over you
and telling you what to do," Raz said.
Harn disagrees: "The future is pretty
promising for the competitive scene. I
could see it becoming as big as Netflix or
ESPN in the coming years, I really do."
Whether eSports stays a niche market
or explodes into the mainstream, the Uni-
versity will remain a hotspot for this hard-
core gaming culture. Campus groups like
Michigan Smash and MLOL are making
it clear that gamers aren't the basement-
dwelling weirdos the mainstream media
often depicts them as. Raz agreed with this
sentiment.
"I hate the stereotype that gamers are
antisocial ... the reason people want to take
part in these communal experiences is so
they feel like they have other people who
are their friends that get them. It's like a
sorority or fraternity of its own," Raz said.
"It's this sense of community that people
want to have. When you first join college
you want to have that sense of belong-
ing, and what better way if you love those
games than to spend time with others who
love them too."
