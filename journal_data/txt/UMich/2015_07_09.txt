Council considers 
pedestrian safety, 

sustainability 

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

Snow removal and other topics 

concerning the environment were 
discussed at the Ann Arbor City 
Council meeting Monday night.

Resident Robert Gordon, who 

was awarded Ann Arbor’s Green 
Fair volunteer of the month 
award, spoke about local landfill 
space and ideas on how to make 
use of it.

“There’s going to come a day 

when we are going to realize that 
landfill space could be park space, 
could be places where there’s 
affordable housing, could be plac-
es where there’s retail,” Gordon 
said. “... we’re wasting it on gar-
bage — most of which is recycla-
ble or compostable. There’s a lot of 
work to do.”

One of the main topics on the 

meeting’s agenda was the city’s 
current snow removal policy. The 
current legislation states that 

property owners are required to 
remove snow more than one inch 
deep from public sidewalks. If an 
owner fails to remove it, the city 
issues a notice to the owner to 
do so and, if after 24 hours the 
sidewalk isn’t cleared, the city 
removes it. Ann Arbor’s Pedestri-
an Safety and Access Task Force 
recommended changes to this 
policy.

One of the proposed changes 

is to require property owners to 
remove snow even if the snowfall 
does not reach more than one inch. 
This change would hold property 
owners responsible for clearing ice 
from their sidewalks.

Members of council had differ-

ing opinions of the proposed policy 
change while others expressed 
concern for other aspects of the 
city’s snow removal ordinance. 
Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2) said she wasn’t comfort-
able with the policy’s method of 
warning residents to remove their 
snow. Lumm said she thought only 
one warning was not enough and 
asked other councilmembers what 
alternatives were available.

Lumm said some snow removal 

contractors and services don’t 

remove snow until two inches 
have fallen. She also said she was 
concerned that seniors, the dis-
abled, and those who spend time 
out of the city wouldn’t see the sin-
gle snow removal warning issued 
by the city, and would therefore 
be unable to meet the local snow 
removal standards and, as a result, 
be unfairly fined.

“It just doesn’t seem reasonable 

that on a second occurrence a per-
son should be fined $250 to $500 
plus costs to remove,” Lumm said.

Mike Anglin (D–Ward 5) said 

there needs to be better legislation 
for snow removal than the city’s 
current policy. He argued, because 
many Ann Arbor residents rent 
and may be in apartment housing, 
the responsibility of snow removal 
should fall on the owner, not the 
occupant.

“I can’t see this as something 

I’d be willing to take a look at right 
now and push this obligation onto 
elderly people and people with 
limited incomes who then would 
have to hire people to have this 
done,” said Mike Anglin. “It’s 
another type of taxation which I 
would not like see.”

Campaign aims to 
combat extreme 

poverty and 

preventable disease 

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Summer Managing News Editor

This year, a Wolverine will be 

heading to Capitol Hill to participate 
in ONE Campaign, a program that 
works to help fight extreme poverty 
and disease in Africa.

Sara Isaac, a rising LSA senior, was 

one of 16 college students selected to 
serve on the Student Advisory Board 
of the ONE Campaign and attend the 
campaign program based in Wash-
ington D.C.

Each year, ONE Campaign selects 

students from various campaign 
chapters located at college campuses 
across the U.S. to participate in the 
three-day program. Throughout the 
program, students collaborate with 
political leaders, activists and others 
to plan new campaign programs to 
implement on college campuses.

According to a press release from 

campaign leaders, this year’s students 
were selected because of their skills as 
on-campus organizers around ONE’s 
mission of ending extreme poverty. 
They were also selected because of 
their eagerness to engage with other 
students and young people to encour-
age similar activism.

In a statement, Laurie Moskowitz, 

who serves as senior director of U.S. 
Campaigns, said she was excited to 
hear fresh ideas from this year’s Stu-
dent Advisory Board.

“ONE’s Student Advisory Board 

brings together the best and the 
brightest of ONE’s student activists 
to provide crucial insight and shape 
the organization’s campus work,” 
she said.

University experts 
react to Affordable 
Care Act decision

Supreme Court 
ruling garners 

generally positive 
University response

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

In wake of the Supreme 

Court’s 6-3 decision to uphold 
a key component of the Afford-
able Care Act on June 25th, 
several 
University 
experts 

have shared their generally 
positive thoughts on the rul-
ing.

The court’s ruling confirms 

that 
qualified 
Americans 

will receive health insurance 
tax subsidies when they buy 
their insurance from a federal 
exchange marketplace.

The question before the 

court was whether individu-
als 
could 
purchase 
health 

insurance 
on 
the 
federal 

exchange 
marketplace 
and 

receive taxpayer subsidies, as 
the act states that subsidies 
would be available only to 
those who purchase insurance 
on 
exchange 
marketplaces 

“established by the state.”

The court agreed the only 

way the ACA would work is 
for federal exchange mar-
ketplaces to be established 
for states without their own 
marketplaces to buy the insur-
ance. Furthermore, the court 
ruled that individuals who 
buy their insurance via federal 
exchanges should receive tax 
subsidies.

Chief Justice John G. Rob-

erts Jr. wrote in the majority 
opinion that Congress’ inten-
tion was to improve health 
insurance.

“Congress 
passed 
the 

Affordable Care Act to improve 
health insurance markets, not 
to destroy them. If at all pos-
sible we must interpret the Act 
in a way that is consistent with 
the former, and avoids the lat-
ter,” Roberts wrote.

In his dissent, Justice Sca-

lia voiced his concern that 

the Supreme Court is rewrit-
ing laws and preferentially 
upholding certain laws.

“This Court, however, con-

cludes that this limitation 
would prevent the rest of the 
Act from working as well as 
hoped,” Justice Scalia wrote. 
“So it rewrites the law to make 
tax credits available every-
where. We should start calling 
this law SCOTUScare.”

Assistant Law Prof. Nicho-

las Bagley responded to Sca-
lia’s dissent in the Los Angeles 
Times. He wrote that the court 
ruling did not rewrite the law, 
but rather read the law as a 
whole.

“It’s just that reading the 

law as a whole — keeping in 
mind what it aims to accom-
plish and how it goes about 
accomplishing it — is the right 
way to figure out what those 
words mean, not blinkered lit-
eralism,” Bagley said. “As the 
chief justice rightly appreci-
ated, the broader statutory 
context thus confirmed that 
Congress could not have meant 
what, taken out of context, it 
seems to have said. That’s not 
rewriting the law. That’s read-
ing it.”

A. Mark Fendrick, Univer-

sity professor in the depart-
ment of Internal Medicine 
and the department of Health 
Management and Policy, said 
the court ruling allows people 
who are taking advantage of 
the healthcare system under 
the ACA to still receive tax 
subsidies, but did not neces-
sarily make the health insur-
ance system better.

“The 
court 
ruling 
kept 

things the same,” Fendrick 
said. “It’s not like people got 
anything better by the court 
ruling. What we did in my 
opinion is that we avoided a 
near disaster.”

Fendrick added the ACA has 

room for improvement, par-
ticularly in ensuring patients 
get high-quality services for 
what they are paying for their 
health insurance.

“We still need to appreciate

Bentley Library compiles University history

In preparation 
for bicentennial, 
researchers create 

bibliography

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

In honor of the University’s 

upcoming bicentennial in 2017, the 
Bentley Historical Library is com-
piling a bibliography of stories, 
histories, photographs and other 

artifacts that are representative of 
the University’s past.

The contents of the bibliography 

are accessible to the public online 
and include everything from his-
tories written about the University 
to photographs of the first football 
team. Bentley archivists are cur-
rently looking to expand the fiction 
section of the work, which either 
includes or lightly alludes to the 
University.

In 1936, Wilfred B. Shaw, then 

director of the University Alumni 
Association started the bibliogra-
phy. Archivists at the University 

have recently picked up the project 
in preparation for the upcoming 
bicentennial.

Brian Williams, the lead Bicen-

tennial Archivist, said the contents 
of the bibliography include histo-
ries and case studies that James J. 
Duderstadt, president of the Uni-
versity from 1988 to 1996, wrote, as 
well as others, such as Shaw. Some 
of these works include “The Mak-
ing of the University of Michigan” 
by Howard Peckham, Margaret 
Steneck and Nicholas Steneck, and 
“History of the University of Mich-
igan” by Elizabeth Ferrand.

Bicentennial 
archivists 
have 

found a total of 2,500 artifacts that 
relate to the University, but Wil-
liams said they are still looking for 
more. Williams added that, while 
the bibliography itself may not 
be exciting, the books and stories 
included in it are.

“You’d find some really interest-

ing little anecdotes,” Williams said. 
“By today’s standards, student life 
was hard. At first, students lived 
in the dorm, had to cut their own 
wood, and classes started at five 
in the morning. A bell would wake 
everyone up to begin studying.”

Williams added that hazing was 

a significant part of student life at 
the University.

Some of it was sports-minded, 

but in other cases they’d kidnap 
students,” Williams said. “... a lot of 
freshmen would get their hair cut. 
We have scrapbooks that have snip-
pets of hair from students.”

In addition to the campus atmo-

sphere, Williams said the history 
of library cataloguing is starkly dif-
ferent from its present state, said 
Williams, who noted the various 
changes in research technology.

The council scheduled a working 

session for this fall to work out the 
details of the snow removal ordi-
nance.

Council also addressed resolu-

tions 
concerning 
sustainability. 

One resolution approved by council 
confirmed a contract with the Ecol-
ogy Center of Ann Arbor, a local 
organization focused on environ-
mental sustainability, to educate 
children in Ann Arbor and Dexter 
public schools about recycling.

Members of council discussed 

the importance of using Ann Arbor 
tax revenue to educate Dexter chil-
dren: the water from Dexter comes 
to Ann Arbor, polluted or clean.

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) asked a representative 
from the Ecology Center to con-
firm that the education of Dexter 
schoolchildren was meant to ben-
efit Ann Arbor’s environment.

“We could provide this educa-

tion only in Ann Arbor classrooms, 
but we wouldn’t be able to address 
the impact other communities have 
on our drinking water if we focused 
only on providing education in the 
city of Ann Arbor,” Briere said.

“Our ability to collaborate with 

the Dexter Public School system 
to provide a small intervention and 
educational program in their sec-
ond-grade classrooms is an asset 
for the city and benefits the city — 
correct?” said Briere.

“We’re really excited for this 

year’s talented Student Advisory 
Board members to bring their ideas 
to Washington.”

Isaac currently serves as leader 

of the University’s chapter of the 
ONE Campaign, and worked with 
fellow campaign members to gain 
Senate co-sponsorship for the Elec-
trify Africa Act, a resolution that 
could bring electricity to 50 mil-
lion people living in Sub-Saharan 
Africa if passed.

As a member of the advisory 

board, Isaac, who also served on 
the board from 2013-2014, will par-
ticipate in a meeting with members 
of Congress at Capitol Hill to dis-
cuss the resolution.

In an e-mail to the Daily, Isaac 

said she was thrilled to find out she 
was chosen to serve on the board 
again.

“It was incredible to discover 

that I had been selected to serve 
on the SAB again,” she said. “Lob-
bying senators on Capitol Hill is 
extremely gratifying, and having 
the opportunity to do that is pretty 
awesome.”

She also said she hopes to use her 

experiences to educate the Univer-
sity community more about pov-
erty and disease in Africa.

“The number of people living in 

extreme poverty (on less than US 
$1.25 a day) has halved since 1990, 
thanks largely to organizations like 
ONE,” she said. “I hope that serv-
ing on the SAB gives me the tools 
I need to help remove the greatest 
barriers to Africa’s development 
and prosperity, like lack of electric-
ity, which trap hundreds of mil-
lions of people in extreme poverty. 
I’m excited to educate Michigan’s 
students and faculty about issues 

like energy poverty.”

Moskowitz said the efforts of 

college student activists are vital in 
ending extreme poverty.

“College students bring a pow-

erful and passionate voice to the 
global fight against extreme

poverty and have made a historic 

difference in persuading American 
lawmakers to confront

some of the world’s most diffi-

cult challenges,” she said.

that there are over 10 million 

people who are uninsured,” Fen-
drick said. “One of the principal 
reasons that people remain unin-
sured is they find that the health 
plans that are available to them 
are not deemed to be worthwhile 
expenditure, and in fact they 
think they are better off just pay-
ing the penalty.”

Fendrick directs the Univer-

sity’s Center for Value-Based 
Insurance 
Design, 
which 
is 

dedicated to removing financial 
barriers to essential, high-qual-
ity clinical services. The insur-
ance design is based on “clinical 
nuance,” which acknowledges 
some medical services are more 

important than others.

“Instead of the consumers 

paying the same out-of-pocket 
for every diagnostic test, every 
drug and every doctor visit, we 
would like to see health plans 
that actually have low or no 
out-of-pocket costs,” Fendrick 
said. “As a doctor, I would like a 
health plan to send out-of-pocket 
expenses to patients based on 
how much healthier the service 
would make them, as opposed to 
how much it costs.”

Several state representatives 

also voiced support for the ACA 
ruling.

Congresswoman Debbie Ding-

ell (Mich.–12) applauded the 
court ruling in a statement on 
the day of decision.

O

n July 4, as people celebrated 
the United States’ Indepen-
dence Day and I watched 

the smoke settling 
from the fireworks 
of the night sky, 
I could not stop 
thinking 
about 

the fog that looms 
over the nation.

Nine 
members 

of 
the 
Emanuel 

African Methodist 
Episcopal Church 
in South Carolina 
were 
shot 
and 

killed on June 17 by Dylann Roof. In 
the aftermath, many were unsure of 
what to make of the situation. Many 
people were quick to blame guns in 
order to spark another debate over 
gun laws. Media 
outlets 
called 

for 
a 
greater 

awareness 
of 

mental 
health 

awareness.

Many sigh and 

claim, “We may 
never know why 
he did it.” Others 
question wheth-
er labeling it is 
important or not 
because it will 
have no effect on 
the severity of Dylann Roof’s punish-
ment. But, in order to properly con-
demn such acts and keep them from 
happening again, we must not hesi-
tate to call it by its name.

This was an act of domestic 

terrorism.

The FBI defines domestic ter-

rorism as “primarily occurring on 
American soil and involving acts 
dangerous to human life that violate 
federal or state law; Appear intended 
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian 
population; (ii) to influence the poli-
cy of a government by intimidation or 
coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct 
of a government by mass destruction, 
assassination or kidnapping.”

Though it’s clear that this act was 

dangerous to human life, the question 
seems to be whether or not it appears 
intended to intimidate or coerce a 
civilian population, and ongoing 
investigations suggest that others 
may have known about his plans.

“I have no choice,” Roof wrote. 

“I am not in the position to, alone, 
go into the ghetto and fight. I chose 
Charleston because it is most historic 
city in my state, and at one time had 
the highest ratio of blacks to Whites 
in the country. We have no skinheads, 
no real KKK, no one doing anything 

but talking on the internet. Well 
someone has to have the bravery to 
take it to the real world, and I guess 
that has to be me.”

This attack was symbolic. It was 

political. The church that Roof 
attacked has historical significance 
to the Black community, as it has 
been attacked multiple times in the 
past. Witnesses claim he said he came 
to the church “to shoot Black people.”

Roof is a white supremacist. He 

is a racist. There is a picture of him 
wearing badges linked to apartheid 
Africa and another picture of him 
burning an American flag. Based on 
his Internet postings and his drunken 
comwments to one of his friends, he 
wanted to start a “race war.”

He 
wore 
a 
badge 
linked 
to 

apartheid Africa.

He 
burned 

the 
American 

flag.

He wanted to 

start a race war.

And yet, we 

still 
question 

whether 
he 

should be called 
a terrorist.

There should 

be 
the 
same 

outrage 
and 

response 
from 

over this attack 

as there would over any attack against 
Americans incited by such hate. Too 
often we are stuck in this idea that 
only foreign terrorism or Islamic 
terrorism are what Americans should 
be afraid of, but the rise of this racial 
climate starting in our own backyards 
is completely ignored. If this had been 
a person of color, they would have 
been called a thug or a terrorist in a 
second. Instead, former FBI agent 
Jonathan Gilliam told CNN he most 
likely had a mental illness and Sen. 
Lindsey Graham said he was “one of 
those wacked out kids.”

We, as a nation, are going down 

a very dangerous path if we fail to 
realize these disparities and how far 
this has gone. If Donald Trump, a 
U.S. presidential candidate, can stand 
on national television and claim that 
Mexican immigrants are rapists and 
bump up to second in the Republican 
candidacy, there’s a problem much 
greater than one lone wolf. Racism is 
still deeply rooted in this nation.

We put in pen that all men were 

created equal 228 years ago.

It’s about time we start acting 
 

like it.

Gov. Rick Snyder intro-

duced the performance-based 
education 
funding 
system 

when he first took office in 
2011. The budgetary system is 
popular throughout the Unit-
ed States, with 34 states utiliz-
ing it in some form because it 
aims for schools to graduate 
as many students as possible, 
as efficiently as possible. In 
Michigan, higher education 
appropriations makes up 1.7 
percent of the School Aid 
Fund and performance-based 
funding makes up about 5 per-
cent of the aid schools receive 
from the School Aid Fund. 
The model was introduced by 
supporters who believe per-
formance-based funding will 
motivate schools to adhere to 

state standards and practices 
in higher education.

However, according to stu-

dents and faculty at OU, WSU 
and EMU, the current perfor-
mance-based aid isn’t always 
beneficial to the higher edu-
cation cause. WSU President 
M. Roy Wilson criticized the 
performance funding system, 
claiming that it penalizes the 
university for having a more 
inclusive enrollment policy 
and doing a large amount of 
research. Furthermore, stu-
dents from EMU are worried 
about how they will be able to 
pay for the increased cost their 
colleges now require from 
their students.

Performance-based 

funding clearly isn’t working 

if universities are willing to 
forgo the funding to obtain 
enough money to provide 
the necessary resources to 
maintain 
operations. 
This 

“all-or-nothing” mentality of 
this funding system has forced 
universities’ hands to burden 
their students unnecessarily. 
If a performance-based model 
is going to continue, colleges 
must be rated against similar 
institutions; WSU caters to a 
different type of student than 
OU or the University. There 
needs to be understanding 
and accommodations when 
it comes to funding. If the 
state of Michigan wants to 
reward based on performance, 
it 
should 
look 
at 
the 

bigger picture.

The time has come

FROM THE DAILY

Fair funding
 The state legislature must review its higher education funding
O

n Tuesday, Oakland University announced it would increase 
tuition by 8 percent starting in the fall semester. The drastic 
tuition increase is well above the state-imposed cap of 3.2 

percent that colleges must meet in order to receive their performance-
based aid from the state. OU joins Eastern Michigan University — 
which increased its tuition 7.8 percent in mid-June — in being the 
only colleges in Michigan to forfeit their performance-based aid by 
increasing tuition well above the cap. In 2013, Wayne State University 
similarly increased its tuition by 8.9 percent. These exuberant increases 
help to highlight inefficiencies in the current higher education funding 
system. The state legislature must alter the performance-based aid in 
order to ensure students are able to access the education they deserve.

We put in pen that 
all men were created 
equal 223 years ago. 
It’s about time we 
start acting like it.

After 

all, I’ve only 
just 
returned 

from a few weeks absence. So, 
sorry, no profile of the river, or 
Pita Kabob, or WCBN or any of 
my other favorite places that I 
believe everyone should run to 
this instant. This week’s column 
is about the more abstract Ann 
Arbor we take with us, for better 
or for worse.

My charge is that a city lives 

inside of its people too. That its 
bounds are extended by the travails 
of its goers in a structure not all that 
different from the way the 25 books 
you have checked out from the 
school’s library extend the branch 
to your basement desk, right next to 
the beer pong table that hasn’t been 
cleaned in a 
few 
weeks. 

Ann 
Arbor 

was with me 
this 
week-

end because 
it is a state 
of mind now 
intertwined 
with my own; 
Maize 
and 

Blue 
walk 

with me.

While 

many of you 
were watch-
ing women’s soccer for the first 
time, I was glued to Wimbledon. 
The tournament is magical to me. 
Growing up, Roger Federer on a 
Sunday morning in July was just 
as good as Old Saint Nick crawling 
down my chimney in December.

2008, anyone?
With 
that 
said, 
this 
past 

weekend was only the first week 
of play which means, interestingly 
enough, that Wimbledon isn’t 
scoring all that much Big Network 
time. If you wanted to watch many 
of the matches, you had to go to 
the Tennis Network via your cable 
or satellite.

Due to the lack of Big Corporate 

Sponsors lined up at its door for 
advertisement time, Tennis Net-
work’s commercial selections are 
absolutely appalling, or at least 
I think so. Much akin to 4 a.m. 
infomercials, they’re headlined by 

combo packs consisting of 10 disks 
featuring 200 songs from the 
Golden Age of country music and 
blenders that have the power to 
blend up a whole box of hammers 
if need be. They usually contain 
one to two washed up celebrities, 
either retired or unemployed. 
Most have the same overexcited 
narrative male voice over that so 
obviously doesn’t believe that this 
is the greatest deal since The Chop 
House accidentally printed a post-
er for all-you-can-eat filet mignon.

One in particular was the worst. 

Brett Favre was modeling a back 
brace called Copper Fit, which is 
marketed toward those afflicted 
by aching vertebrae. The com-
mercial starts with a shot of Favre, 
the retired Packers and too many 
other teams quarterback, loading 
hay into a white four by four, you 
know, because he does that.

Why is this all important again?

Because 

I 
wouldn’t 

shut up after 
I saw it. I 
needed 
to 

analyze it. I 
spoke at least 
three essays 
out loud to 
the chagrin 
of my sisters 
and cousins 
and 
girl-

friend 
dur-

ing a holiday 
vacation. 

“Sick consumerist ploy,” “Harsh 
capitalist undertones achieved via 
manipulative commercial rheto-
ric.” I used the words “juxtaposi-
tion” and “narrative framework” 
in an academic sense at least five 
and a half times, which is five and 
a half times more than I would 
ever like to.

I’m trying to say that I read that 

commercial in my parent’s living 
room on a lake under the lapis 
lazuli dome of the crystal sky like 
Ulysses in Hatcher’s Reference 
room, pencil in hand, annotations 
bookmarked, and it kind of scared 
me, because I’m realizing I’m 
changing. I’m no longer new to 
school; so much of it has sunk in 
and it’s starting to show.

Sometimes it feels like the 

shrub of your brain is being tenu-
ously carved out by a Maize and 
Blue figure holding electric trim-

mers. Then there’s you, mouth 
agape, watching from your front 
window in horror of your own 
lack of control.

On the drive home Monday 

morning, I listened to the new 
Courtney Barnett record (which 
everybody should go buy from 
Wazoo tomorrow) and thought 
a lot about the fabulous lyric 
on her song “Pedestrian at 
Best” which goes: “Give me all 
your money and I’ll make some 
origami, honey.”

My episode of intense critique 

happened all over again. I had to 
“unpack” (ugh, that word) the 
song and discuss its cultural and 
political context. What is she 
really saying about monetary 
value? What does her saying 
what she said really say about 
the tensions between value sys-
tems in society? What am I even 
talking about?

Listen to the music. Just lean 

back, watch the film. Here, have 
a Cheeto.

Indeed, the whole venture of 

leaving school and being around 
things that aren’t your school 
or your city can be tiring and 
confusing. This is the reason 
why I value one family member 

of mine in a very particular way: 
my youngest sister Sophia, age 
nine. She is a very, very funny, 
intelligent, 
loveable 
baby. 
I 

highly 
recommend 
everyone 

engage the opinion of a child at 
least once a week; they are more 
creative than you.

I spent most of the holiday 

weekend doing what my Grandpa 
Sparkman would dub ‘recreating’ 
with my little sisters, their friends 
and my family. This included 
things like shooting pool, gam-
bling and playing euchre, ping 
pong, football and a simple game 
called Tiki Toss that my mother 
became acquainted with on the 
beaches of Vero.

The girls’ favorite thing to 

do is a drawing game called 
Telestrations. (Everyone should 
go buy this from somewhere 
that’s not the Walgreen’s on State 
Street). The quick logistics: up to 
eight people can play at once; each 
player gets their own dry-erase 
packet filled with eight blank 
sheets; the game starts when 
each player picks a card from the 
middle deck with the name of 
an object on it; each player must 
then write the name of the object 
on page one and then attempt to 

draw the object on page two; each 
player then passes the booklet to 
the person on the left who must 
guess what the object is; the cycle 
is repeated until the booklet is full.

You can see how the game can 

be entertaining and silly, objects 
usually end up something far dif-
ferent than their original identity.

The card I drew was ‘Monas-

tery.’ I tried my very best to draw 
Dostoyevsky’s Alyosha Karam-
azov and then passed the book, 
hilariously enough, to my little 
sister who, after I peeked to see, 
wrote down, ‘A very Scary Jesus.’ 
After six little girls’ drawings it 
made its way to my girlfriend on 
the right of me. She guessed, ‘A 
Gingerbread Man in a puddle,’ 
which I then had to draw.

And I’m sure there is much to 

think about here, from plenty of 
vantage points, but it was one of 
the rare moments this weekend 
when I didn’t. I just laughed 
with all of my company and 
drew a curvy ginger man with a 
big old bite mark taken out of his 
side, all the while stooped upon a 
watery spot.

‘Magic Mike XXL’ gives 
women what they want

MOVIE REVIEW

Stripper flick treats 
women as the worthy 

audience they are

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

A lot of women love “Magic 

Mike.” During its first five days 
in theaters, “Magic Mike XXL” 
played 
to 
an 

audience 
com-

posed primarily 
of females — 96 
percent of the 
people 
seeing 

the film over the 
holiday weekend 
were women. If 
the movie made 
$27.1 
million 

and the average ticket price was 
$8.00, then 3.39 million people 
spent their Fourth of July gazing 
at Channing Tatum in a thong. 
Just 140,000 of these people 
were men.

This statistic is astounding, 

but it makes sense. Anyone can 
enjoy the movie, but “Magic 
Mike” is made for the ladies. 
“Magic Mike XXL” truly exalts 
its female viewers, providing an 
all-encompassing experience of 
fun and pleasure that isn’t avail-
able anywhere else in cinema. In 
this film, women are presented 
as queens who deserve to be lis-
tened to, loved and respected, 
and men should act according to 
a woman’s needs. For 115 min-
utes, “Magic Mike XXL” fulfills 
its duty to its royal audience, and 
puts on a banging performance 
that effectively satiates its view-
ers’ desires.

“Magic 
Mike 
XXL” 
fol-

lows 
former 
stripper 
Mike 

Lane (Channing Tatum, “Dear 
John”) as he reunites with his 
old friends for one last road 
trip to a stripping convention 
in Myrtle Beach. The script is 
more ensemble-driven than the 
original “Magic Mike,” and the 
road movie structure gives the 
movie an excellent opportunity 
to explore its supporting char-
acters with greater depth. Each 
member of the “Kings of Tampa” 
emerges more fully formed, each 

with his own goals, ambitions, 
sense of humor and dance moves. 

Without 
Dallas 
(Matthew 

McConaughey, 
“True 
Detec-

tive”) managing their perfor-
mances, the guys also learn to 
find their own joy in stripping 
— they don’t want to be firemen 
and cops anymore. Stripping is 
their preferred method of self-
expression, so crucial to their 
identities that one performer 
even says he’d keep doing it even 
if he got rich and didn’t need the 
money. “Magic Mike XXL” ’s 
choreography is especially cre-
ative in the way that each guy 
brings his personality into his 
performance. The new moves 
aren’t always perfect (unless, of 
course, it’s anyone’s fantasy to 
see Matt Bomer sing a D’Angelo 
song while humping the floor), 
but on the whole, the choreogra-
phy is sexy and innovative.

“Magic Mike XXL” also has 

a solid grasp on its inherent 
campiness. Many of the actors, 
including Tatum, Gabriel Igle-
sias and Donald Glover, are natu-
ral comedians, and their comfort 
with the movie’s sillier material 
shows. It’s easy to forget that the 
original “Magic Mike” was actu-
ally a very depressing movie, 
with heavy themes of corrupted 
innocence, addiction and failure. 
“XXL” is a better movie for leav-
ing behind all the sad stuff and 
for allowing Channing Tatum 
to reveal to the audience that 
his drag queen name would be 
“Clitoria Labia.” If “Magic Mike 
XXL” is tasked with providing a 
pleasurable experience for the 

audience, it’s only fitting that 
the movie is actually pleasurable 
to watch.

Among “XXL” ’s greatest addi-

tions is Mike’s ex-flame Rome 
(Jada Pinkett Smith, “Gotham”), 
who now runs a prestige strip 
club in Savannah. The character 
was originally supposed to be 
played by Jamie Foxx, but Smith 
brings so much to the role that 
it’s impossible to imagine anyone 
else pulling it off. Her chemistry 
with Channing Tatum smolders, 
and the monologues she delivers 
to introduce her strippers engage 
audiences in the strip club and in 
the movie theater. She reinforces 
the movie’s feminist themes by 
her insistence that everyone in 
the room is a beautiful “queen” 
to be worshipped. When she 
addresses the the room about 
what kind of man women want, 
Rome speaks with the confi-
dence of a circus ringleader and 
the pathos of a best friend.

It’s no surprise that only 

140,000 men saw “Magic Mike 
XXL” during its opening week-
end. The film embodies, quite 
clearly, what women want — 
women want a lot of things. Like 
Rome says, women want some-
one who listens to them and 
wants to please them. Women 
want to be treated like a wor-
thy audience and enjoy the same 
sexy material that men can find 
in pretty much any movie today. 
“Magic Mike XXL” makes enor-
mous strides in gender-equal 
film sexuality, and it accom-
plishes all this while staying fun, 
silly and always sexy.

‘BBHMM:’ don’t 
kill me, Rihanna

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

By DANIELLE RAY

Daily Arts Writer

To be honest, it’s rare that I 

ever watch music videos. I find 
most are trite and not worth the 
three or four 
minutes 
they 

took 
away 

from my life 
to watch them 
(I’m 
looking 

at you, Nick-
elback). 
Even 

for my favorite 
artists, it usu-
ally still takes 
a bit of chatter 
around their latest videos for me 
to take a look. That’s why “Bitch 
Better Have My Money” took me 
by such surprise.

The project is almost less of a 

music video and more a short film; 
it’s seven minutes long. Going in, 
I had my fingers crossed that the 
seven minutes would be worth my 
time, but I didn’t have high hopes.

I was wrong.
“BBHMM” is a masterpiece. 

The plot of the video surrounds 
Rihanna and two friends (fel-
low gang members?) who kidnap 
“your wife” and put her “in the 
backseat of my brand new foreign 
car.” Given the lyrics, it’s pretty 
obvious this woman is the “wife” 
of the “bitch,” but as the whole 
video centers on Rihanna tortur-
ing this woman, you can’t help 
but start to think this bitch really 
owes Rihanna some big fucking 
bucks.

Where “BBHMM” really excels 

is making you forget those lyrics 
by the seriously grotesque actions 
committed by Rihanna and her 
friends. They tie the wife up with 
rope, naked and upside down, 
and swing her like a pendulum 

from the ceiling; they force drugs 
and alcohol down her throat; 
they (SPOILER ALERT here and 
below) drown her in a pool whilst 
they have a pool party and flirt 
with the sheriff.

This is all so enthralling that 

when, at the end, the video flash-
es back to the husband the wife 
kissed goodbye in the morning 
and moves into Rihanna fingering 
knives with him tied up in front of 
her, it’s genuinely surprising that 
he is, in fact, the “bitch,” and, pos-
sibly even more surprising, her 
accountant. The video ends with 
Rihanna covered in his blood, 
lying naked (worth watching the 
video for, even if the rest had been 
bad) on top of the trunk she origi-
nally kidnapped the woman in, 
which is now filled with money.

TL;DR version: This video is 

truly terrifying and completely 
captivating for the entire seven 
minutes. You probably won’t be 
able to watch it again for at least 
24 hours because you’ll be so 
thoroughly disturbed.

The true genius, though, is that 

this video really adds something 
— a layer of depth, of plot, intrigue 
and even of social commentary — 
to the song, which is what I find 
lacking in most music videos. 
Although we all know Rihanna 
has seen and been through some 
shit, I highly doubt she is actu-
ally a blood-thirsty killer. With 
“BBHMM,” Rihanna reminds us 
that music is a form of expression, 
and we all have that tiny part in 
us that is just a cold-hearted bitch 
that wants and will get her money 
at any cost. She’s playing a role 
that’s not herself, a party-girl or 
anything else typical of the the 
pop music landscape, in typical 
Rihanna fashion. And that’s why 
we love her.

MUSIC COLUMN

T 

wo of the best albums of 
2015 so far have come out 
in the past few weeks, and 

I’m probably 
one of the few 
people who 
loved both of 
them.
This has been a 
fantastic month 
for music of all 
genres. Besides 
Miguel’s 
ground-
breaking 
Wildheart 
we’ve heard fantastic new releases 
from Kacey Musgraves and Vince 
Staples, two fast-rising stars in 
country and hip hop, respectively.
It might seem odd to see 
Musgraves and Staples in the 
same sentence, because their 
music doesn’t even seem to inhabit 
the same world. But I wanted 
to write about them both in the 
same column today because, even 
though their genres and aesthetics 
are wildly different, as I’ve been 
listening to their albums, I’m 
finding that I like each one for 
strangely similar reasons. Both of 
these records are great because 
their artists use songwriting as a 
way to represent their cultures and 
bring you into their worlds.
For me, Vince Staples’s 
Summertime ’06 was a hotly 
anticipated release. The 21-year-
old has come up on a wave of 
hype after associations with Mac 
Miller and Odd Future, with 
Summertimemarking his official 
debut release. Clams Casino and 
the now-legendary No I.D. do their 
part on production by throwing 
swirling dark clouds over every 
track, but Staples owns this record 
alone with his words and voice. 
Much like Kendrick Lamar on 
good kid, m.A.A.d city, Staples 
takes his introduction to a mass 
audience as an opportunity to 
recreate the streets from which 
he came. But while Lamar colored 
the bleak violence of Compton 
with huge, radio-ready choruses 
and songs that were legitimately 
fun to listen to, Staples sounds 
like he’s rapping in an isolated 
post-apocalyptic wasteland. 

These aren’t party anthems; 
they’re sober reflections and 
un-sugarcoated truths.
Staples creates the scenes of 
his youth with an astoundingly 
mature touch. As Shayan Shafii 
wrote last week, Staples takes 
a page from guys like 2Pac and 
Kendrick by playing the survivor 
role and telling the stories of his 
friends who didn’t make it out. 
Staples details almost all of the 
struggles that face Black men 
growing up in the ’hood — police, 
racism, poverty, violence and drug 
addiction. He grapples with his 
newfound status, with being the 
rich outsider in his neighborhood 
and playing shows to white crowds 
while knowing how little has 
changed where he’s from. This 
record is not an enjoyable, breezy 
listen, but it contains valuable 
insights about American life that 
everyone should hear.
On the other hand, while I was 
ready to hear Summertime ’06 the 
day it came out, I count myself as a 
member of the notorious “anything 
but country” music fan clique. So 
I’ll admit that Kacey Musgraves 
was nowhere near my radar until 
soon after her sophomore major-
label release, Pageant Material 
came out a few weeks ago. And 
the easy explanation for why she 
seemed to very suddenly reach 
my ears is because Musgraves 
doesn’t sound like modern country 
music. She’s found acceptance 
in indie-rock and hipster circles 
because her acoustic arrangements 
and quieter reflections are a far 
cry from the booze-and-chicks 
anthems of guys like Jason Aldean 
and Luke Bryan.
Any record with small acoustic 
arrangements and vocal-heavy 
songs is going to be judged 
primarily on its lyrics, and 
Musgraves has plenty of great 
ones. Her songs range from down-
home perkiness (“Cup of Tea”) to 
quietly, lovingly reflective (“Late to 
the Party”), but they all undeniably 
have Musgraves’ personal stamp 
of self-deprecation and trail blazer 
mentality. There’s an obvious 
twang in practically every note, but 
fans of indie singer-songwriters 
should never be too uncomfortable, 

as Musgraves’ warmth and wit 
should affect you even if you’re 
strictly a hardcore hip-hop head.
It’s been weird for me, alternating 
between the two of these albums 
since I discovered them, because 
it’s hard to imagine two works of 
art more culturally or sonically 
divergent. Though commercial 
country music does owe a certain 
debt to hip-hop, Musgraves and 
Staples are both operating outside 
their genres’ modern radio sounds. 
Musgraves is acoustic, traditional 
and timeless, with her work 
serving as a callback to fierce 
iconoclastic country personalities 
of old while also creating a new, 
relevant one for today’s world. 
Staples, meanwhile, has made an 
album almost completely bereft 
of the glamour, opulence and 
escapism that a lot of radio hip hop 
plays up. This is the last album 
you would ever expect to be called 
Summertime — Future’s hook on 
“Señorita” is the brightest things 
ever get, and even that sounds 
like a ghostly approximation of 
Future’s typical all-out energy. 
But even though they both stay 
away from certain genre clichés, 
Musgraves and Staples songs are 
fiercely proud to represent The 
South and South Central LA, 
respectively, and I can’t imagine 
two more different places in 
America for an artist to come from.
Occasionally, though, Musgraves 
and Staples fall into the worst traps 
of their styles of music. A couple of 
the obvious singles on Musgraves 
album (“Biscuits” and “Family Is 
Family”) are wall-to-wall filled 
with the most clichéd down-home 
sayings you can imagine (like 
“I burned my own damn finger 
poking someone else’s fire”). The 
lines are cute and old-school on 
their own, like something your 
grandma might say, but all together 
they can come off as pandering 
and incongruous with the rest of 
<Pageant Material. Staples, for his 
part, can’t quite acquit himself of 
mainstream hip-hop misogyny by 
including women in his narrative 
only as nameless “bitches” and 
“hoes.” Staples probably deserves 
a pass here because he’s expertly 
recreating a world he inhabited 

when he was only an immature 12 
years old, but in general, I’ve been 
wishing since To Pimp a Butterfly 
for a major hip hop record to tell 
stories of “life in the ’hood” from 
a woman’s perspective. However, 
the onus shouldn’t be on Staples to 
deliver that — and I’m glad it’s not, 
because Staples really isn’t good 
at telling women’s stories (see the 
at-least-eyebrow-raising second 
verse of “Surf,” in which he seems 
to be guilt-tripping a young girl 
choosing to have an abortion).
But obviously, none of these flaws 
come anywhere near sinking 
their respective records. I love 
both of them, even if they sound 
weird back to back. Musgraves 
has gone back to the past to 
create a new model for a 21st 
century country music star with 
her reflective, independent and 
feminist melodies, while Staples 
has fearlessly embraced his role as 
fearless social critic, philosopher 

and torch-bearer in a chaotic and 
uncertain world — both incredible 
feats for artists still in the early 
stages of their careers. But both of 
these records are especially great, 
regardless of genre or where they 
come from, because of the bare 
humanity laid out in each of them. 
Neither Musgraves nor Staples 
is perfect — and, well, you’re 
delusional if you expect them to 
be — but they’re both sharing their 
personal stories. If an artist simply 
has the courage to invite you into 
his or her world, that deserves 
respect; but if he or she does it with 
as much intelligence and skill as 
Musgraves and Staples, it demands 
attention. Even if you normally 
never listen to their style of music, 
give Musgraves and Staples a shot 
and step into their worlds.

country music. To stop him,

HathiTrust, a digital library 

that partners with academic insti-
tutions, has collaborated with 
Google to scan each page and digi-
tize the books in Bentley, Shapiro 
and Hatcher, as well as those in the 
bicentennial bibliography.

“The whole field’s changed,” 

said Williams. “Just getting our 
catalogue online was a huge thing. 
And now having the texts them-

selves online is just a quantum leap 
forward.”

Williams said those interested 

in viewing the books can read 
them online or even print them 
with Shapiro’s Expresso Book 
Machine, which quickly prints up 
to 300-page manuscripts.

On 
the 
Bentley 
Historical 

Library’s website is additional 
information about the bicenten-
nial, the history of the University 
and links to digital copies of the 
books included in the bibliography.

HISTORY
From Page 3

“The rejection of King v. Bur-

well by a vote of 6-3 sends a 
loud, strong message across this 
nation,” Dingell said. “Health-
care is a right, not a privilege. 
Bottom line: today’s decision is 
a victory for working families 
across this country.”

Sen. Gary Peters (D—Mich.) 

also applauded the ruling in his 
statement.

“The intent of the Affordable 

Care Act has always been crys-
tal clear: all Americans should 
have access to affordable health 
insurance, regardless of what 
state they live in,” Peters said. 
“Eliminating these tax credits 
would have created a catastro-
phe for the nation’s health care 
system, taking away affordable 
health insurance from millions 
of families and leading to sky-
rocketing premiums.”

Michigan is one of the states 

that did not establish a state-
based 
exchange 
marketplace 

for insurance and relies on the 
federal marketplace. Under the 
Court’s ruling Thursday, Michi-
gan residents would be able to 
receive tax credits from the fed-
eral government.

In 2014, 184,297 Michiganders 

were using the federal exchange 
marketplace and received $13.2 
million in rebates. As of March 
2015, 293,843 Michigan resi-
dents were covered through the 
federal exchange.

Rick Pollack, president and 

CEO of the American Hospital 
Association, told U.S. News and 
World Report although the court 
ruling cleared a hurdle for the 
ACA, hospitals across the nation 
still face other issues, especially 
persuading state legislatures to 
expand their Medicaid programs 
to low-income adults — people 
under 65 and 138 percent below 
the federal poverty level.

Under the ACA, hospitals face 

payment cuts that will add up to 
approximately $36 billion over 
a decade, money that was sup-
posed to be offset by states’ Med-
icaid expansion. Currently, 21 
states do not have the Medicaid 
expansion, and hospitals in these 
states will be hit the hardest by 
the payment cuts.

As support for the Medicaid 

expansion, a new study from the 
University’s Institute for Health-
care 
Policy 
and 
Innovation 

looked at how well the expansion 
of Medicaid is working to reduce 
the burden of uncompensated 
care on hospitals in Connecticut. 
Connecticut was the first state 
to add low-income adults to the 
Medicaid program in April 2010.

Sayeh 
Nikpay, 
a 
visiting 

scholar at University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley’s School of Pub-
lic Health and an alumna of the 
University’s School of Public 
Health, was one of the authors 
who conducted the study.

“This paper shows that when 

you provide coverage to people 
who don’t have it, hospitals 
have to absorb less of the cost 
of uncompensated care — both 
charitable care and from unpaid 
bills,” Nikpay said. “I hope our 
results will reinvigorate the 
discussion in state legislatures 
about expansion.”

The team plans to study Mich-

igan’s Medicaid expansion next. 
The state of Michigan has a 
larger Medicaid population than 
Connecticut.

University lab works 
to increase flexibility 
of electronic devices

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Breaking from the traditional 

rules of material engineering, a 
research lab at the University is 
working to effectively bend elec-
tronic devices.

The Kotov Laboratory at the 

University is working to give 
electronic 
devices 
increased 

flexibility.

Dr. Nicholas Kotov, a Chemi-

cal Engineering professor and 
member of the Materials Science 
and Engineering Department at 
the University, said stretchable 
conductors are materials that 
can be used in many electronic 
devices and help the device ade-
quately bend and stretch.

The 
technology 
requires 

fundamental accessibility and 
availability of materials that can 
conduct electricity well and be 
mechanically transformable.

Stretchable conductors usu-

ally consist of material that is 
made up of polymers, such as 
rubber. These materials are not 
very conductive on their own; 
however, when combined with 
ductile metal wires, the versa-
tility of the conductors increas-

es.

According to Terry Shyu, a 

doctoral student in the Materials 
Science and Engineering depart-
ment and member of the Kotov 
group, the ability to combine 
these two properties is very use-
ful as society’s interest in flexi-
ble electronics, displays and even 
biomedical implants increases.

However, 
when 
improving 

conductivity of the material, 
flexibility is sacrificed.

“It is an interesting problem 

that would require an out-of-the 
box solution,” said Dr. Kotov. 
“The traditional approach that 
many people apply tends to com-
promise performance, so we 
decided to apply something out-
rageous.”

The “outrageous” approach 

Dr. Kotov referred to is Kirigami, 
the ancient Japanese art of paper 
cutting. The success of the Kotov 
group’s stretchable conductors 
lies in its usage of this technique.

“This idea started from play-

ing with Kirigami paper sculp-
tures 
from 
the 
artist 
Matt 

Shlian,” Shyu said. “We were 
interested in seeing how paper 
art — essentially a really robust 
mechanical system — can help us 
design materials.”

Shyu measured how materi-

als respond under tension using 
a tensile test. What she and her 
colleagues found was that paper 
behaved comparably to poly-

meric material. They could now 
control the response of these 
materials by implementing vari-
ous cutting patterns.

Kirigami is especially useful in 

stretchable conductors because 
the integrity of the material does 
not have to be compromised — 
in other words, the chemistry 
or composition of the material 
remains unaltered. The method 
also helps diminish uncontrolled 
failure by predetermining points 
of strain in the material, allow-
ing for predictability of the elec-

trical conductivity.

While other research focuses 

on a materials approach, what 
sets the Kotov group’s research 
apart is that it combines engi-
neering material and geometry, 
allowing for the predictability of 
the deformation of the material.

“We are quite excited by initial 

experimental data,” Dr. Kotov 
said. “It means that instead of 
the dry methods of designing 
these conductors, we now have 
a really robust engineering com-
putational tool which can be cou-

pled with the composites and all 
together this creates a founda-
tion for designing and mechanics 
of conductivity.”

The 
advent 
of 
effective 

stretchable conductors has the 
potential to be a game-changer 
in the world of electronics.

According to Shyu, an obvious 

path for stretchable conductors 
is flexible electronics, such as 
batteries and sensors.

“Many people are jumping on 

the idea of structuring deforma-
tion,” Shyu said.

Stamps students work to aid A2 homeless

Art school pairs 

with local non-profit 
to bring tiny homes 

to Ann Arbor 

By ALEX JUNTTI

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
collaborative 
project 

between the Stamps School of 
Art & Design and a local home-
less advocacy group has the city 
abuzz with the possibility of a 
tiny house community.

MISSION, a non-profit orga-

nization dedicated to providing 

a voice for the city’s homeless, 
has been an advocate for the 
tiny houses project for several 
years and hopes to see the con-
cept take shape in Ann Arbor.

Brian Durrance, a MISSION 

board member and former presi-
dent of the organization, said a 
tiny house community would 
not only benefit the local home-
less population but could also 
service those who don’t need 
larger facilities.

“Many people see these hous-

es as a solution to the problem of 
affordable housing, not only for 
homeless people but for single 
people and aging adults — peo-

ple who don’t need all of the 
amenities a large house offers,” 
Durrance said. “I think a lot of 
the technical issues are being 
worked out across the coun-
try in different conversations, 
and those discussions are now 
occurring as well here in Ann 
Arbor.”

The efforts of MISSION were 

matched by those of Ann Arbor 
City Council Member Stephen 
Kunselman (D– Ward 3), who 
recently brought forth a propos-
al to bring a tiny house commu-
nity to a city-owned property at 
415 W. Washington Street.

The idea to build a tiny house 

community at that specific loca-
tion has since been abandoned 
due to issues concerning legal-
ity, practicality, and previous 
proposals for developing that 
property. The wake of Kunsel-
man’s push, however, has many 
community members consider-
ing the option of incorporating 
tiny houses into the city in the 
future.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-

pher Taylor, who was opposed to 
Kunselman’s proposal, said that 
415 W. Washington may not be 
the right location for the project 
and that the timing is not be the 
best for this experiment.

“There are zoning and build-

ing code obstacles in respect 
to tiny homes,” Taylor said. 
“If they can prove to be legally 
available within the boundaries 
of state law, we, in Ann Arbor, 
would be interested in exploring 
how we could incorporate tiny 
homes into our affordable hous-
ing portfolio.”

dents enrolled in Experimental 
Architecture in the STAMPS 
School of Art and Design, dedi-
cated an entire semester to the

Jim Minick offered to 
resign, but Jim 
Hackett refused it

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

After being arrested on suspi-

cions of drunk driving May 8 and 
consequentially being suspended 
from his post as associate ath-
letic director for football on May 
13, Jim Minick felt that resigning 
was the natural next step.

Interim Athletic Director Jim 

Hackett disagreed.

“Jim Minick submitted his res-

ignation and I refused it,” Hackett 
said. “This is a man who served 
seven tours of duty (in the Marines). 

Selflessness is a way I would 
describe him. He got thousands of 
emails, most of them from people 
who served in war with him, urging 
him to soldier through this.

“He and I had deep conversa-

tions about it, and I was convinced 
this is a guy who will learn from 
this mistake.”

On the night of his arrest, 

Minick crashed his vehicle into 
a ditch on Airport Boulevard and 
State Street just south of Ann 
Arbor. The 51-year-old refused a 
breathalyzer test at the time, but 
blood tests would later reveal his 

blood-alcohol content level was 
0.185, well above the legal driv-
ing limit of 0.08.

Minick, a lifelong friend of Jim 

Harbaugh who was one of the coach’s 
first 
hires 
at 

Michigan 
and 

even 
teamed 

up with Har-
baugh to assist 
two women in a 
car accident in 
March, pleaded 
guilty to oper-
ating a vehicle 
while intoxicat-
ed and refusing 
a 
breathalyzer 

test on June 24. He received eight 
months of probation and a $1,325 fine.

“He made a life terrible mis-

take,” Hackett said. “He dealt with 
something that can kill people. 
People die, either himself or others, 
from what happened. So the grav-
ity of it was not dismissed at all.”

Despite 
the 
resignation 

offer, Hackett felt Minick could 
improve after his mistake. Even 
after Harbaugh — who was 
arrested on suspicion of driv-

ing 
under 
the 

influence 
in 

2005 — request-
ed Hackett take 
a second look, 
Hackett saw an 
opportunity for 
improvement.

“(Harbaugh) 

wanted to make 
sure he was being 
objective,” Hack-
ett 
said. 
“The 

coach has no margin for error in 
judgment when people under-
stand they’ve gotten a break, 
and now they have to prove their 
commitment. We’ve got a really 
tight alignment on what the stan-
dard is moving forward.

“You have one of two ways you can 

go, you either get manipulated by peo-
ple who make mistakes and they can 
con you into being compassionate,” 
Hackett said. “If you’re compassion-
ate, you get people who unexpectedly 
are surprised by that and then they 
become better employees.”

So far, outcry about Hack-

ett’s decision has been minimal. 
The interim athletic director has 
received three letters express-
ing disapproval, but Hackett has 
responded to all three letters with 
the same justification.

“We 
deal 
compassionately 

with people who make mistakes, 
we’re not setting different stan-
dards,” Hackett said. “(It’s) more 
about what I need to do to get 
him back on his feet. This is not 
a guy who has had a serial prob-
lem, and even then I would’ve 
given him a deep consideration, 
but that’s not the narrative here. 
This is a one-time mistake that 
was made.”

“This is a 

guy who will 
learn from his 

mistake.”

Catching up with NFL 
LB Brandon Graham

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

On Saturday, former All-Ameri-

can, Big Ten MVP and first-round 
draft pick Brandon Graham will 
host his first-ever youth camp in 
his hometown Detroit. Like many 
of the camps he has volunteered at 
for his NFL peers, the linebacker 
aims to bring out the community 
in a fun-for-all event. 

Last month, the Daily sat down 

with the Eagles’ linebacker to dis-
cuss his camp, hometown and, of 
course, Jim Harbaugh.

The Michigan Daily: You see 

a lot of NFL players at camps, 
volunteering their time. what’s 
the draw from an athlete’s per-
spective?

Brandon Graham: “Just seeing 

the kids have fun, giving back, just 
to see their faces light up when 
they see people like us, that’s not 
that far away from where we are 
now. It’s just a blessing to be able 
to come back, see the kids and 
have some fun.”

TMD: You’re from Detroit, 

an area that Michigan tries to 

work with a lot both in and out 
of sports, how important is that 
connection with the community?

BG: “That’s the biggest thing 

about being here in Ann Arbor, 
you want to have a connection 
with Detroit, because this is your 
home. They’re going to be the guys 
that come and make this Universi-
ty better, so you better make sure 
that you can connect with them.

“We can relate to a lot of the 

things they’re saying because we 
know the area and a bit of what 
they go through. You might have 
gone to the same schools or know 
some of the same people. The con-
versation and connection is there 
because you’re from the same 
place. You feel right at home.

“I think with (Michigan coach 

Jim) Harbaugh being here and 
everyone helping to get that con-
nection, it’s going to help a lot of 
people by building that relation-
ship. That’s the start of it, having 
stuff down there, people up here 
go down there, people down there 
come up here, just enjoy each 
other and keep building.”

TMD: You’re starting your 

own 
event 

this 
year, 

what’s 
spe-

cial 
about 

your camp?

BG: 
“It’s 

called Select 
100, and it’s 
100 boys and 
100 girls. I 
wanted 
to 

make 
girls 

a part of it 
because obvi-
ously you see 
a lot of dudes at these camps, but 
there’s not much that the girls 
can do. So what I wanted to do is 
bring in half and half for girls and 
boys. We built an obstacle course 
for the girls to go though, and then 
we’re going to finish with the girls 
by introducing them to yoga and 
promote anti-bullying, teamwork, 
confidence building for everyone. 

It’s going to be a good time, 

man. I’ve never seen a camp like 
this with girls involved, and I 
wanted to do something different 
than what everyone else has.”

TMD: Switching gears, you’ve 

been pretty vocal about your 
support for Harbaugh and this 
year’s team. What have you seen 
from the outside that has you so 
excited?

BG: “The energy, it’s all about 

the energy. I’d heard about Har-
baugh when I was in the league 
and how he was there and at 
Stanford, and everyone says he’s a 
great coach. I just can’t wait to see 
it show up at Michigan, because 
we sure need a spark.

“You can just see by the recruit-

ing. I think we’ve got the players 
now that’re going to be good, and 

I think Harbaugh is really going to 
develop the guys and get the maxi-
mum out of each guy.”

TMD: You were a part of 

some successful and unsuccess-
ful teams at Michigan. What 
advice would you give this team 
if they’re trying to win a champi-
onship and establish Michigan’s 
dominance again?

“Just stay together, make sure 

when things get rough that you’re 
staying together. That’s when you 
really find out how good your team 
is, when you’ve got a little adver-
sity or teams might start to break 
up, you’ve got to stay together.”

Hackett unsure of future, 
but confident in game plan

Despite strong fan 
support, interim 
athletic director 

hesitant to commit

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

After firing Brady Hoke, hir-

ing Jim Harbaugh and landing 
a reported record-high apparel 
deal with Nike, most Michigan 
fans would happily let Interim 
Athletic Director Jim Hack-
ett drop the 
‘Interim’ part 
of his title and 
simply 
take 

the job.

But 
just 

like 
all 
the 

decisions 
he 

has made at 
the 
position, 

Hackett 
is 

happy to take 
all the time he 
needs to make sure his decision 
on his future, whatever it is, is 
the right one.

“I’m not there yet,” Hack-

ett said on Tuesday. “I know it 
sounds funny to you, but there’s 
no hidden thing. It’s working, so 
why mess with it?

“Right now, I’ve got more 

issues to tackle, so I’m focused 
on that.”

Hackett’s patience is a luxury 

afforded by a support staff that 
now includes former Oregon 
State Athletic Director Bob De 
Carolis. De Carolis — a former 
Michigan softball coach and ath-
letics administrator from 1979-
1998 — has retired to Ann Arbor 
after 17 years at Oregon State, 
and is serving as a senior advi-
sor with no intentions of becom-
ing the next Athletic Director at 
Michigan.

De Carolis is helping out with 

day-to-day tasks, such as ongo-

ing construction 
at 
Michigan’s 

athletic campus, 
and is a part of a 
team of experi-
enced assistants 
and 
advisors 

Hackett is dele-
gating expanded 
leadership roles 
to.

“We have very 

clear ownership 

of aspects within the organiza-
tion,” Hackett said. “It’s a little 
different than (predecessor Dave 
Brandon’s). I have a smaller team 
working for me, but they have 
bigger jobs.”

“They pray I don’t manage 

the day-to-day,” he added with a 
grin. “What we have is a perfect 

fit for my style.”

The 
system, 
as 
Hackett 

explained it to reporters on 
Tuesday, 
is 

what he called a 
‘Point-of-View’ 
process. Essen-
tially, 
when-

ever a task or 
problem arises, 
whichever 
employee 
has 

the most expe-
rience in handling the issue will 
take control, sometimes even 
giving orders to Hackett.

The result, according to Hack-

ett, is an increased ownership 
and devotion to the tasks, along 
with visible acuity to the issue at 
hand.

“I’m not saying I’m above it 

all or distant, it’s just finding 
where is the best use of my time. 
Bill Gates used to use a phrase 
call ‘Bill Dollars,’ because where 
do you want to spend Bill Dol-
lars over the course of the day in 
Microsoft? 

“Where do you want to spend 

Jim Hackett’s time? Where can 
we get the most leverage from 
him, and what are his skills and 
gifts? There’s a lot of that around 
me that is much better handled 
by (fellow employees).”

But the elephant in the room 

remains. 
Eventually, 
Hackett 

will have to take ownership of 

the job, or pass it on to the next 
candidate.

***

Fan approval of the Athletic 

Department is evidenced by 
decade-high ticket interest and 
sales, but Hackett knows the 
circumstances 
behind both his 
arrival — when 
he 
replaced 

the 
resign-

ing 
Brandon 

in 
November 

— and decision-
making 
don’t 

indicate a suc-
cessful 
long-

term future.

“When I came 

here, (University President Mark 
Schlissel) had been on the job I 
think eight weeks,” Hackett said. 
“There was a sea of problems (at 
Michigan) that weren’t just ath-
letics, but a lot of transitional 
pieces going around. In the midst 
of that, we’ve got the football 
program and I thought ‘With all 
that, the things you would need 
to know about somebody to make 
a decision of their permanence, 
we bypassed.’

“So it would be like a forced 

marriage, 
and 

what’s 
the 

probability that 
that’s going to 
live like my 39 
years of mar-
riage? So I said 
to 
the 
Presi-

dent, ‘If you’re 
OK, I’d like to 

put that off until we both think 
it needs more attention.’ ”

Hackett has asked Schlissel to 

meet with him after the presi-
dent returns from China, and 

has at least three more major 
projects that he isn’t ready to 
announce yet.

His mind isn’t made up about 

the future, but thanks to an 
enhanced support staff, it doesn’t 
have to be.

“You almost want the thing 

running better almost as if you 

weren’t there, 
because 
it 

means 
every-

one 
around 

you is stron-
ger,” 
Hackett 

said. 

“I want you 

to think about 
empowerment 
and growth as 
a virtue I get 
to bring to the 

organization. If the day I leave 
everyone says, ‘He asked us to 
do more and we were better,’ I’d 
be happy with a report card like 
that.”

pending apparel deal would be 
one of his biggest decisions on 
the job.

He also knew that the school 

he worked for would have power 
in such a deal, 
but it wasn’t 
until 
a 
rival 

Athletic Direc-
tor spelled it 
out to him that 
he 
realized 

just what kind 
of machine he 
was driving.

“ ‘I just want 

to 
set 
your 

mind in the right context, Michi-
gan is one of the most valuable 
brands,’ – and he paused – ‘in 
sports,’ ” Hackett recalled his 
colleague saying. “ ‘I’m talking 
about auto racing, golf, base-
ball, NFL, NBA … the Michigan 
brand, Jim, is one of the most 
valuable assets in sports.’

“I had a lot of pride hearing 

that, but it really got me to think 
what does the most valuable 
brand in sports deserve?”

As negotiations progressed, 

Hackett would find out that 
Michigan’s potential partners 
were thinking about that too. 
According to Hackett, Adidas, 
Nike and Under Armour all 
offered Michigan the largest 
apparel contract in the country. 
Full financial details are expect-
ed to be released as soon as next 
week, but currently the largest 
contract is Notre Dame’s 10-year, 
$90 million deal with Under 
Armour.

But with all three companies 

offering 
similarly 
substantial 

sums, Hackett insists that the 
decision to go with Nike was not 
solely a financial one.

“(Being the largest contract) 

was never in any stated goal of 
where we are or what we want-
ed,” Hackett said. “In your expo-
sure to the firm, from visits and 
meeting with leadership, you 
learn there’s a lot of value in dif-
ferent ways than money.”

In an extensive process that 

began in February, Michigan 
sought to turn over every stone in 
research to not only pick a win-
ner, but also prove that winner 
right to any naysayers. A giant 
board with “investigative lanes” 
including pages upon pages of 
market research, performance 

evaluations, fan, 
player and alum-
ni feedback and 
analytics 
filled 

an entire room 
in the athletic 
department.

And 
as 
the 

room filled, so 
did 
Hackett’s 

confidence in his 
final decision.

“In the end it was obvious that 

it was going to be Nike,” Hackett 
said. “I found myself in the posi-
tion where I could not argue the 
decision of picking them. Early 
on you could make the argument; 
there were some really good 
competitors in this mix.”

With a bidding war larger 

than any other 
in the history 
of college ath-
letics, 
Hack-

ett 
and 
his 

team 
sought 

to 
challenge 

all three com-
panies beyond 
their wallets. 
Among 
those 

challenges was 
a 15-year plan, 
highlighting Hackett’s focus on 
the long-term success of the deal.

“I was looking for the future,” 

Hackett said. “It didn’t matter 
that Nike was really successful 
here in the past, it didn’t matter 

that Under Armour had invented 
a wicking system no one else had, 
it didn’t matter that Adidas had 
this global domi-
nance, 
we’re 

signing 
a 
new 

15-year deal.

“I said to each 

one of them ‘I 
want to be ahead, 
not just a fast fol-
lower, I want be 
ahead of every-
one out there.’ 
We gave each of 
them a challenge 
in that regard, and Nike did the 
best job.”

Nike’s eye on the future was 

nice, but would not have resulted 
in a deal had it not been for its 
current standing. More then tri-
pling the revenue of Adidas and 
Under Armour combined at $11.2 
billion, Hackett found it to be far 
and away the leader in athletic 
apparel.

More importantly to Hack-

ett, however, was Nike’s stand-

ing as a market 
leader 
in 
the 

eyes of coaches, 
athletes, 
alum-

ni and fans. In 
dozens of for-
mal and infor-
mal discussions, 
students 
and 

student athletes 
informed Hack-
ett of their senti-
ments. Michigan 

football coach Jim Harbaugh 
revealed his preference for the 
brand his second day on cam-
pus. Michigan alums playing in 
the pros — some of whom played 
for the Wolverines during Nike’s 

previous contract with Michigan 
from 1994-2007 — also voiced 
their opinions.

The 
over-

whelming 
majority sup-
ported Nike.

“That voice 

really 
came 

through,” 
Hackett 
said. 

“I was delight-
ed that they 
loved the Uni-
versity 
that 

much, 
that 

they really care about the deci-
sion now and want us to be 
great.”

It took four months to make 

the call, but by suspending all 
biases, Hackett learned not only 
how powerful the Michigan 
brand was, but that Nike is exact-
ly what one of the most valuable 
brands in sports deserves.

“I can’t exaggerate enough 

that we suspended our decision 
as long as we could to make the 
right one,” Hackett said. “We’re 
really excited for what the future 
holds.”
