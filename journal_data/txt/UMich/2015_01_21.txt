the statement

Governor also 

urges voters to pass 
ballot proposal to 
fix roads in May

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Staying true to his nickname, 

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, the 
“tough nerd,” emphasized edu-

cation as one of several means to 
create opportunity in his State of 
the State address Tuesday.

Using a “river of opportunity” 

as a metaphor for improving edu-
cation and job prospects in the 
state, among other issues, Snyder 
said he will shift the state’s focus 
from creating new programs to 
addressing problems.

“Quite often we’re addressing 

symptoms. We’re not addressing 
root causes. In some cases, we’re 
actually facilitating dependency 

on government,” Snyder said. 
“That’s not right.”

Snyder said his plan would 

focus on five principles: people, 
causes, increasing results without 
increasing cost, community and 
measuring outcomes.

Though several other gover-

nors who may be potential 2016 
presidential candidates discussed 
national policies in their address-
es, Snyder primarily emphasized 
Michigan-centric policies. Snyder 
has not discussed any potential 

2016 candidacy despite specula-
tion.

On education, Snyder intro-

duced several key initiatives that, 
if passed, would impact Michigan 
students from preschool to higher 
education, including calling for 
legislative support for a statewide 
evaluation system for K-12 teach-
ers and a commission to study 
third-grade reading scores.

He also announced he will ask 

the legislature to include an addi-

City will engage 

in efforts to 

displace temporary 
camps humanely 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

The heaviest topic of discus-

sion of Tuesday’s Ann Arbor 
City Council meeting centered 
on the city’s homeless camps. 
The dialogue came in the wake 
of numerous demonstrations by 
public commenters supporting 
these camps.

In recent months, Council-

member Stephen Kunselman 
(D-Ward 3) has been targeted 
by members and allies of Ann 
Arbor’s 
homeless 
commu-

nity following statements last 
November that some considered 
offensive. These claims resulted 
in a petition to recall Kunsel-
man, which was approved in the 
first week of January.

Subsequently, the council dis-

cussed and approved a revised 

This year’s 
event open to 
undergraduates

For the Daily

Over 40 employers and hun-

dreds 
of 
students 
gathered 

Tuesday in the Dana Build-
ing’s Ford Commons for the 
University’s first campus-wide 
Green Career Fair. Open to all 
University students, the fair 
showcased internships and jobs 
centered around environmental 
and sustainability issues.

Though the School of Natu-

ral Resources and Environment 
has organized similar fairs for 
graduate students in the past, 
this year’s event was open to all 
students.

The fair was co-hosted by 

the student organizations Stu-
dents for Clean Energy and Net 
Impact Undergrad, and spon-
sored by the environmental 
consulting firm Antea Group.

LSA 
senior 
Jesse 
Selvin, 

president of Students for Clean 

Energy, co-organized the event 
and said many students are 
concerned about sustainability, 
but do not know how to become 
involved.

“We really want to make sure 

students know sustainability is 
something that’s vital both on 
campus and afterwards,” Sel-
vin said. “And not only that it’s 
vital, but that it’s available, it’s 
accessible.”

Selvin added that he was 

pleased with the diversity of 
participating companies.

“I would say it runs the gam-

bit from environmental consult-
ing companies to engineering 
companies to nongovernmental 
organizations and research,” he 
said.

Han Zhang, a representative 

from Dow Chemical, said it is 
important for students to rec-
ognize that they can apply their 
interest and skills in sustain-
ability beyond college.

LSA senior Michelle Dimuzio 

said she liked the fair’s con-
centration on environmental 
careers in contrast to larger 
career fairs. She attended the

The Central Student Gov-

ernment’s main focus Tuesday 
night was funding additional 
power stations in the Shap-

iro Undergraduate Library to 
address 
students’ 
mounting 

needs to charge up.

The new electricity expan-

sion proposal would place an 
additional 67 table-mounted 
power stations in the UGLi. 
These would include three 
power outlets and one USB port 
each.

Because there were ques-

tions about the project’s total 
cost and the need for charging 

stations to include USB ports, 
the resolution was ultimately 
referred to CSG’s finance com-
mittee and will come to a vote at 
next week’s meeting.

costs 
would 

amount to $8,772 — the resolu-
tion in place proposes that CSG

prominent in State

News Editor

President Barack Obama gave 

his seventh State of the Union 
address Tuesday evening before 
a Senate and House controlled 
by the Republicans for the first 
time during his presidency.

The 
president’s 
speech 

touched on several key issues 
from his years in office, includ-
ing conflict in the Middle East 
and the economic recession. He 
expanded on proposed reforms 
in several areas announced by 
the White House in the weeks 
leading up to the address as 
well.

Chief among his reforms 

were proposals to impact the 
price of paying for college as 
part of an overarching theme 

addressing “middle-class eco-
nomics.”

“Middle-class 
economics 

means helping working fami-
lies feel more secure in a world 
of constant change,” Obama 
said. “That means helping folks 
afford childcare, college, health 
care, a home, retirement — and 
my budget will address each of 
these issues, lowering the taxes 
of working families and putting 
thousands of dollars back into 
their pockets each year.”

In the address, Obama specif-

ically stressed a plan announced 
earlier in the week to simplify 
and consolidate the American 
Opportunity Tax Credit, an 
2009 initiative that gives low 
and middle class families tax 
benefits on higher education 
costs. Though the AOTC is set 
to expire by 2017 under the cur-
rent tax plan, Obama said he 
hopes to make it a permanent 
feature of the tax code, with 
the amount of credit adjusted to 
keep up with inflation.

The president also proposed 

making it easier to apply for tax 
credits, as well as require col-
leges and universities to pro-

Official warnings 
come over two days 
after 50,000 gallons 

of oil leaked 

GLENDIVE, 
Mont. 
(AP) 

— Eastern Montana residents 
rushed to stock up on bottled 
water Tuesday after authori-
ties detected a cancer-causing 
component of oil in public water 
supplies downstream of a Yellow-
stone River pipeline spill.

Elevated levels of benzene 

were found in water samples 
from a treatment plant that 
serves about 6,000 people in the 
agricultural community of Glen-
dive, near North Dakota.

Scientists from the federal 

Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention said the ben-
zene levels were above those 
recommended 
for 
long-term 

consumption, but did not pose a 
short-term health hazard. Resi-
dents were warned not to drink 
or cook with water from their 
taps.

Some criticized the timing of 

Monday’s advisory, which came 
more than two days after 50,000 
gallons of oil spilled from the 
12-inch Poplar pipeline owned by 
Wyoming-based Bridger Pipeline 
Co. The spill occurred about 5 
miles upstream from the city.

Adding to the frustrations was 

uncertainty over how long the 
water warning would last. Also, 
company and government offi-
cials have struggled to come up 
with an effective way to recover 
the crude, most of which appears 
to be trapped beneath the ice-
covered Yellowstone River.

A mechanical inspection of the 

damaged line Tuesday revealed 
the breach occurred directly 
beneath the river, about 50 feet 
from the south shore, Bridger 
Pipeline spokesman Bill Salvin 
said.

The cause remained undeter-

mined.

By Tuesday, oil sheens were 

reported as far away as Williston, 

North Dakota, below the Yellow-
stone’s confluence with the Mis-
souri River, officials said.

“It’s scary,” said 79-year-old 

Mickey Martini of Glendive. “I 
don’t know how they’re going to 
take care of this.”

Martini said she first noticed a 

smell similar to diesel fuel com-
ing from her tap water Monday 
night. Officials previously didn’t 
know whether the spill happened 
beneath the iced-over river or 
somewhere on the riverbank.

Martini said she was unable 

to take her daily medicines for a 
thyroid condition and high cho-
lesterol until she picked up water 
from a public distribution center 
later in the day.

Representatives from the state 

and the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency earlier said pre-
liminary monitoring of the city’s 
water showed no cause for con-
cern. The water treatment plant 
operated until Sunday afternoon, 
more than 24 hours after pipeline 
operator Bridger Pipeline discov-
ered the spill, officials said.

Additional tests were conduct-

ed early Monday after residents 
began complaining of the petro-
leum- or diesel-like smell from 
their tap water. That’s when the 
high benzene levels were found.

Benzene in the range of 10 to 

15 parts per billion was detected 
from the city’s water, said Paul 
Peronard with the EPA. Any-
thing above 5 parts per billion is 
considered a long-term risk, he 
said.

Peronard acknowledged prob-

lems in how officials addressed 
the city’s water supply, includ-
ing not having the right testing 
equipment on hand right away 
to pick up contamination. But 
Peronard and others involved in 
the spill response said officials 
acted based on the best informa-
tion available.

“Emergencies don’t work in 

a streamlined fashion,” said 
Bob Habeck with the Montana 
Department of Environmental 
Quality. “It’s a process of discov-
ery and response.”

Several residents interviewed 

by The Associated Press said they 
first heard about the water prob-
lems through friends and social 
media sites, not the official advi-
sory.

“They could have been more 

on top of it,” Whitney Schipman 
said as she picked up several cases 
of bottled water for her extended 
family from a water distribution 
center. “As soon as there was a 
spill, they should have told every-
body.”

Officials took initial steps Tues-

day to decontaminate the water 
system. Glendive Mayor Jerry 
Jimison said it was unknown 
when the water treatment plant 
would be back in operation.

Until that happens, Salvin said 

the company will provide 10,000 
gallons of drinking water a day 
to Glendive.

The company established a 

hotline for people with ques-
tions about the water supply and 
to report any wildlife injured by 
the spill: (888) 959-8351.

Another pipeline spill along 

the Yellowstone River in Mon-
tana released 63,000 gallons 
of oil in July 2011. An Exxon 
Mobil Corp. pipeline broke dur-
ing flooding, and oil washed up 
along an 85-mile stretch of riv-
erbank.

Exxon Mobil faces state and 

federal fines of up to $3.4 million 
from the spill. The company has 
said it spent $135 million on the 
cleanup and other work.

The Poplar pipeline involved 

in Saturday’s spill runs from 
Canada to Baker, Montana, pick-
ing up crude along the way from 
Montana and North Dakota’s 
Bakken oil-producing region.

The pipeline receives oil at 

four points in Montana: Poplar 
Station in Roosevelt County, 
Fisher and Richey stations in 
Richland County, and at Glen-
dive in Dawson County. The 
section of pipeline that crosses 
the Yellowstone River was last 
inspected in 2012, in response to 
the Exxon accident, according to 
company officials.

Nutrition information readily 
available on new dining hall app

The app uses the 
same data as online 
MyNutrition tool 

BY IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

For students with dietary 

restrictions, eating in University 
dining halls just got easier.

In December, the University 

of Michigan application added 
nutrition facts for the food 
served at University dining halls. 
Now, students can access infor-
mation about food allergens of 
individual items through the 
dining section of the app.

Kathryn Whiteside, assistant 

director of Michigan Dining, 
said the new app function had 
been in development for a few 
years before coming to fruition.

Michigan Dining had already 

developed an online tool called 
MyNutrition, which allows stu-
dents to see the nutrition facts of 

the dining hall food served that 
day, up to a week in advance. The 
same data used for MyNutrition 
were used for the Michigan app.

“All the data were in our data-

base, so it was an easy transi-
tion,” Whiteside said.

According to Whiteside, the 

idea initially started from an 
effort to make nutrition informa-
tion more accessible and avail-
able to the students.

“We are always trying to 

stay ahead of the curve,” Whi-
teside said. “Anything to get 
the (nutrition) information out 
there for the students is good.”

The dining hall nutrition 

facts can now also be accessed 
from the MyFitnessPal app, 
which helps its users to self-
monitor their calorie intake.

Sarah Ball, senior research 

area specialist at the Michigan 
Metabolic and Obesity Center, 
wrote in an e-mail interview 
that increasing student aware-
ness of the nutrition facts for 
dining hall food because the 

students do not make the food 
themselves.

“When we eat outside of 

our homes, we often choose 
items blindly, not really know-
ing what is in them,” Ball said. 
“That is okay for someone eat-
ing out a few times a week, but 
for the students, it is all meals, 
so knowing what you are eating 
is particularly important.”

Ball also said the informa-

tion will help students plan 
meals ahead and avoid the con-
sequences of impulse decisions.

LSA 
sophomore 
Morgan 

Grantner wrote in an e-mail 
interview that the availability 
of the nutrition facts is espe-
cially useful for students with 
dietary restrictions or food 
allergies.

“You can see the exact ingre-

dients in the food,” Grantner 
said. “Without these online 
menus or apps, it would be 
difficult to eat at dining halls 
because there would be no 
method of planning, which is 
usually necessary when trying 
to avoid allergens.”

However, Grantner also said 

the choices for people with food 
allergies and dietary restrictions 
are sometimes sparse in the din-
ing halls, which can lead to stu-
dents opting out of meal plans.

“It’s often very easy for me 

to go to a store and find a des-
ignated gluten-free section or 
go to a restaurant and ask for 
a gluten-free menu,” Grantner 
said. “However, my experience 
eating at the dining halls last 
year was not as easy. I lived at 
West Quad last year, and all 
that I would ever (attempt to) 
eat were the burritos with glu-
ten-free shells. And even then, 
those would fall apart on con-
tact. The meal plan was just not 
worth it for me.”

Currently, users can only 

access nutrition facts on din-
ing hall food items. Michigan 
Dining is working toward pro-
viding the nutrition facts for all 
retail venues in Michigan Din-
ing, such as Java Blue or Mujo 
Café.

Harvard-affiliated doctor in 

critical condition 

after shooting

A shooting occurred Tuesday 

morning at the Harvard-affiliat-
ed Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital in Boston. The suspected 
shooter is dead and the doctor 
who the police believe was his 
target is in critical condition 
after sustaining at least two gun-
shot wounds, The Harvard Crim-
son reported Tuesday.

At a press conference Tues-

day, Boston Police Commissioner 
William B. Evans said the offi-
cers searched the facility before 
finding the alleged shooter inside 
an examining room.

Evans said in this examining 

room, they found the shooter 
dead with a weapon lying next to 
him. He also went on to say that 
the authorities suspect that this 
specific physician was targeted 
for a reason that is currently 
unclear.

Evans commended the first 

responders, who “did everything 
they could to neutralize not only 
the situation but also get the care 
to that doctor.”

Student protest shuts down

Monday.

The demonstration included 

an attempt to block the west-
bound entrance of the bridge for 
28 minutes.

The demonstrators formed 

a line blocking traffic as they 
chanted slogans and displayed 
signs protesting police brutality.

Not long after the demonstra-

tion began, California Highway 
Patrol officers approached the 
line of protestors and placed all 
68 in custody at the side of the

Fraternities 
cause damage

BY LINDSEY SCULLEN

Three University frater-

damages to two ski resorts 
in 
northern 
Michigan. 

Damages included broken 
walls and felled ceiling tiles 
around the hotel.


vide students with information 
on federal student aid, like AOTC 
and Pell grants.

The combined impact of the 

president’s tax benefit propos-
als would provide students with 
$2,500 in educational aid per 
year for up to five years, accord-
ing to a White House release.

Along with tax credits, the 

president also touched on a pro-
posal announced earlier this 
month: to make two years of 
community college free for most 
students.

“By the end of this decade, two 

in three job openings will require 
some higher education,” Obama 
said. “Two in three. And yet, we 
still live in a country where too 
many bright, striving Americans 
are priced out of the education 
they need. It’s not fair to them, 
and it’s not smart for our future.”

Students across the politi-

cal spectrum at several watch 
parties 
Tuesday 
evening 
all 

expressed enthusiasm for the 
college-related proposals.

LSA 
sophomore 
Daniel 

Karr, president of the Univer-
sity’s chapter of Common Sense

higher education costs and com-
munity college affordability were 
key parts of Obama’s speech.

“They are both policies that 

will make the U.S. more competi-

tive in the global economy and 
will specifically help millenni-
als,” Karr said. “One of the most 
important issues he addressed 
was reducing the debt burden 
that college students face.”

LSA senior Trevor Dolan, pres-

ident of the University’s chapter 
of the College Democrats, also 
said the policy was a big step for-
ward for economic revitalization 
in the United States.

LSA senior Gabe Leaf, presi-

dent of the University’s chap-
ter of College Republicans said 
Obama’s plan for free two-year 
community college is unlikely 
within two years, yet Obama 
pushed it in effort to gain public 
support and approval.

“He can get the PR out of it 

without having to really work 
through the rest of the plan,” 
Leaf said.

In an interview after the 

speech, Communications Assis-
tant Prof. Josh Pasek said though 
the president attempted to find 
bipartisan support on issues like 
his community college proposal, 
conservatives will view the ini-
tiative as a predominantly Dem-
ocratic issue. He said the GOP 
would instead view the proposal 
as a “tax burden” and therefore 
in direct opposition to their core 
values.

“Right now, at a moment, there 

is very little that the parties are 
willing to have serious discus-
sions on,” Pasek said.

Obama also pushed for sev-

eral other economic measures, 
including paid sick days, pay 
equity between men and women 
and a raise to the minimum 
wage, all ideas he’s pushed for 
throughout his tenure.

“These 
ideas 
won’t 
make 

everybody rich, or relieve every 
hardship,” Obama said. “That’s 
not the job of government… but 
things like child care and sick 
leave and equal pay; things like 
lower mortgage premiums and a 
higher minimum wage — these 
ideas will make a meaningful dif-
ference in the lives of millions of 
families.That is a fact.”

In an interview after the 

speech, Michael Heaney, assis-
tant professor of organizational 
studies, said these kinds of eco-
nomic issues, such as minimum 
wage and pay equity for women, 
are core Democratic principles 
that are often reiterated despite 
GOP opposition.

“The Democratic agenda just 

always persists,” Heaney said. 
“Something like paid sick leave 
for women is something that 
the United States stand behind 
most other developed countries. 
So it’s the kind of thing (where) 
you have strong resistance to 
these kind of policies, but if you 
support them, you have to keep 
pushing them.”

Along with economic issues, 

the president also called for sev-
eral significant foreign policy 
shifts, namely a resolution from 
Congress to authorize force 

against the Islamic State of Iraq 
and Syria, a terrorist group.

He also touched on recent 

moves his administration has 
made to improve diplomatic rela-
tions with Cuba, namely making 
it easier for Americans to travel 
there, and called upon Congress 
to fully remove the United State’s 
trade embargo against the coun-
try.

Heaney said Obama’s decision 

to talk about Cuba was a political 
maneuver.

“I think that a number of 

people see that as an accomplish-
ment for the Obama adminis-
tration,” he said. “He definitely 
wants to remind people he did 
that.”

In response to the State of the 

Union address at large, Aaron 
Kall, the University’s direc-
tor of debate and an expert on 
election politics, said many of 
Obama’s initiatives would not 
pass through Congress. How-
ever, he said the fact the presi-
dent outlined such bold reforms 
would introduce the topic to 
legislatures and citizens for 
debate.

“The 
president 
used 
the 

speech tonight that was roughly 
watched by tens of thousands of 
people to start this conversa-
tion and this dialogue,” Kall 
said. “And so if there were to 
be some room for compromise, 
things would look differently.”

event last year as well, when it 
was focused on graduate stu-
dents, and noted that this year 
there was a wider variety of 
employers present.

According to Selvin, Stu-

dents for Clean Energy and Net 
Impact Undergrad began orga-
nizing the fair at the beginning 
of the semester. They used a 
poll to gauge student interest, 
and received favorable results. 
Their goal was to increase stu-
dent awareness of opportunities 

related to the environment and 
sustainability.

Selvin said he hopes the 

Green Career Fair becomes an 
annual event, with even more 
employers and opportunities 
available to students next year.

“This year we were just sort 

of figuring out, testing the 
water, seeing if any students 
would be interested at all, and 
we had over 500 students reg-
istered,” Selvin said. “And all 
over campus people have heard 
about it, and that’s a really good, 
encouraging sign.”

tional investment of $130 million 
for preschool programs in his 
upcoming budget.

“We need to raise the bar and 

standard on every educational 
institution,” he said.

Though Snyder did not men-

tion the state’s four-year public 
institutions of higher education, 
he touched on several career edu-
cation programs he’s promoted 
throughout his tenure, namely 
apprenticeships.

Last May, Snyder announced 

the Michigan Advanced Tech-
nician Training Program, an 
apprenticeship program.

This year, in a continuation of 

that effort, Snyder said he aims 
to make Michigan the number 
one state for skilled trades, an 
idea President Barack Obama 
echoed during his speech at the 
Michigan Assembly Plant earlier 
this month where he discussed 
plans to increase apprenticeships 
nationally.

Along with apprenticeships, 

Snyder also promoted alternative 
forms of getting credit for higher 
education, namely dual enroll-
ment, a policy the governor has 
heavily promoted throughout his 
tenure in office.

During the address, Snyder 

emphasized what he character-
ized as the bipartisan nature of his 
education initiatives, highlight-
ing the work of state Rep. Adam 
Zemke (D–Ann Arbor) for his 
help passing education bills.

Snyder also signed this year 

the National Guard Tuition Assis-
tance Act, a bill that would provide 
tuition assistance to members of 
the Michigan National Guard.

In an interview after the event, 

Zemke said while there have been 
some efforts on which Snyder and 
the Democratic caucus worked 
together, that wasn’t the case for 
every policy.

“There are certain policies 

that we’ve worked very well in a 
bipartisan fashion on, working to 
support our teachers and teacher 
effectiveness, administrator effec-
tiveness,” he said. “But there’s also 
been a lot of negative policies that 
have been put forward under this 
administration.”

Another key point of the address 

was Snyder’s support for the bipar-
tisan roads comprise passed dur-
ing the lame-duck session last 
month. The plan has the poten-
tial to impact education funding 

as well, by moving funding for 
the state’s universities out of the 
School Aid Fund, which also sup-
ports K-12 schools and community 
colleges.

“No one in Michigan likes our 

roads and bridges,” Snyder said. 
“We got that work done, but our 
work isn’t done. Now we need to 
ask our citizens to support that 
effort in May on the ballot.”

He urged Michigan citizens to 

vote yes on the proposal for safety 
concerns, and said one out of nine 
bridges in Michigan is structurally 
deficient.

As part of his pitch to voters to 

vote yes in May, he paralleled the 
safety of roads to the better schools 
and local governments.

Overall, Snyder noted that the 

budget would be difficult to bal-
ance due to an unexpectedly high 
number of businesses cashing in 
tax credits from the past several 
years, which has resulted in an 
estimated $325 million deficit for 
the upcoming fiscal year.

However, he said he felt confi-

dent in “getting a budget done, five 
years in a row, on time, done well, 
and balanced.”

Snyder also very briefly stated 

the need for a continuing dialogue 
on the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights 
Act. Earlier this year during the 
lame-duck session, the Republican 
Party state legislative caucus was 
split over two different proposed 
changes to the act, one that sug-
gested the inclusion of sexual ori-
entation and gender identity, and 
one that only suggested the inclu-
sion of sexual orientation. The 
state legislature did not pass either 
proposed amendment to the law.

Though Snyder only touched on 

the topic, it did not go unnoticed by 
Democrats.

During a press conference after 

the speech, state Rep. Tim Gre-
imel (D–Auburn Hills), House 
Democratic Leader, said while he 
welcomed Snyder’s interest in the 
continuation of the conversation, 
he didn’t think it went far enough.

“I would have liked a little more 

boldness from the governor,” he 
said. “I wish that he had gone 
before simply calling for a continu-
ation of the discussion and had 
specifically asked for specific lan-
guage in the Elliott-Larsen Civil 
Rights act to protect both folks 
based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity, which has been a 
point of contention.”

Zemke said he also felt encour-

aged by the discussion of the 
ELCRA, but wasn’t sure anything 
would come from it.

tor.

According to finance com-

mittee chair Jacob Ruby, an LSA 
junior, CSG evaluated the needs 
of Hatcher Graduate Library 
and the Art, Architecture and 
Engineering Library as well as 
the UGLi before picking a final 
destination for the funding.

The UGLi was ultimately 

chosen because feedback from 
students and library staff indi-
cated that Shapiro had a greater 
need for more power outlets 

and charging stations than the 
other libraries.

Ruby said the resolution spe-

cifically mentions Moiré power 
stations, designed by Byrne 
Electrical Specialists, because 
these are best fit for students’ 
needs.

“We do have other budgets 

based on other power outlets,” 
Ruby said. “We thought that 
these would be the best so that 
people wouldn’t steal them, 
they look good and they’re very 
easy to use.”

The assembly also voted to 

fund last week’s police brutality 
speak out. The resolution, intro-

duced at the last CSG meeting, 
passed with 34 voting in favor, 
two against and two abstaining.

The 
legislation 
requested 

$300 from CSG’s Legislative 
Discretionary account to fund 
the speak out. CSG, the Black 
Student Union and Students of 
Color of Rackham co-sponsored 
the event; the money was for 
the room rental, audio-visual 
equipment and refreshments.

Additionally, 
new 
leaders 

were elected to the CSG Rules 
Committee and Ethics Commit-
tee Tuesday night.

Rackham 
representative 

Jared Ferguson was selected 

as the new chair for the rules 
committee, the CSG commit-
tee responsible for writing and 
reviewing resolutions related to 
rules and elections.

Engineering 
representa-

tive Andy Modell, a senior, was 
elected as rules committee vice 
chair and Engineering repre-
sentative Zachary Prebay, a 
junior, was chosen as the vice 
chair of the ethics committee. 
The 
committee 
investigates 

CSG ethical violations and has 
the ability to recommend the 
removal of a CSG member if 
ethical violations are found.

version of preexisting legislation, 
Resolution DC-1, “to support best 
practices in response to homeless 
camps in the city of Ann Arbor.”

In response to complaints of 

homeless encampments on both 
private and public property, the 
resolution states that humane 
displacement of homeless camps 
on both private and public prop-
erty is an appropriate response to 
private property owner and resi-
dent complaints.

However, the new version of 

the resolution seeks consultation 
from Washtenaw County’s Con-
tinuum of Care Board to ensure 
humane displacement to better 
accommodate 
individuals 
not 

currently served by the shelter 
system.

By contrast, the old version 

called exclusively for consulta-

tion with “key stakeholders” in 
the homeless community — a pro-
vision still included in the final 
legislation.

The resolution also states that 

“it is not the practice of the City 
of Ann Arbor to proactively seek 
out homeless camps for removal, 
nor to broadly deploy strategies 
to render areas used as campsites 
unusable.”

Approval for the resolution 

came after much discussion and 
debate on the issue from mem-
bers of the council.

Councilmember 
Sabra 
Bri-

ere (D-Ward 1) called for fur-
ther development of policy and 
reforms to address Ann Arbor’s 
homeless issue.

“This deals with the people 

who are camping outside,” she 
said. “It does not begin to address 
the crying need for additional 
alternatives — not just additional 
housing, but additional services.”

For this reason, Kunselman 

touted a more strong-armed 
effort, arguing that ignoring 
homeless camps fosters crime 
and ignores the greater issue of 
a need for permanent affordable 
housing for homeless people in 
Ann Arbor.

“The way that this resolution 

is designed, we’re asking the 
police to turn a blind eye to ille-
gal action ... and I really have a 
problem with that,” Kunselman 
said. “I think that turning a blind 
eye to camp sites is allowing us to 
ignore our homeless problem.”

In response to the resolution’s 

non-proactive approach to abol-
ishing homeless encampments, 
Councilmember Chuck Warpe-
hoski (D-Ward 5) said camps 
should not be outlawed if mem-
bers of the camps neither violate 
the law nor disturb other Ann 
Arbor residents.

“I do not believe that this is 

a case where we should be on a 
seek out and destroy mission,” 

Warpehoski said.

Overall, Kunselman said in an 

interview that he was pleased 
with the approval of Resolution 
DC-1.

“It illustrates the unity on 

council in dealing with a diffi-
cult topic and it was a discussion 
that had to happen and we did,” 
he said. “It (doesn’t) mean that 
we’ve solved anything, but that 
hard work is still ahead of us.”

Apart from this discussion, the 

Council also passed an ordinance 
Tuesday evening allowing chick-
ens to roam the backyards of Ann 
Arbor locals, provided that their 
owners don’t slaughter their 
birds at home.

The adopted resolution per-

taining to chickens — an amend-
ed version of chapter 107, section 
9:42 of City Code — allows resi-
dents with a standard permit to 
keep four to six chickens, while 
residents with a provisional per-
mit may keep no more than two.

W

ith all the focus regarding 
diversity around campus, 
little attention has been 

paid to what peo-
ple actually mean 
when they say they 
want 
“increased 

diversity.” 
For 

the most part, the 
focus of the debate 
has been on get-
ting more people 
of color enrolled 
at the University. 
Unfortunately, 
this narrow defini-
tion leaves out many other diversity 
options, ones that are necessary for 
today’s modern education.

As a 35-year-old undergrad, I am 

no stranger to discrimination via lack 
of diversity on campus. It’s mostly 
benign things, like students sitting 
next to the professor before they’ll sit 
next to the “creepy old guy.” Some-
times, it’s that cute girl at Bert’s giving 
me a weird look when I assure her, yes, 
I am a student (or maybe it’s the creepy 
old guy thing). Usually I just shrug it 
off and continue, but occasionally I 
recall that while we’re peers, I have 
more in common with my professors 
than I do other students.

I’m not the only student experi-

encing this. Before long, your parents 
won’t just be your ride to school, but 
your lab partners, too. With the con-
tinued shift from a labor economy to a 
service economy, the average age of a 
college undergrad should continue to 
go up for the foreseeable future. With 
the increased age comes increased 
responsibilities, and the University 
is not adequately equipped to handle 
them.

Older-student support at the Uni-

versity is commendable in spirit and 
condemnable in practice. In all fair-
ness, the University has traditionally 
served a very young demographic. As 
older students, we have responsibili-
ties far surpassing those of normal 
undergrads — spouses, children, 
houses and businesses, to name a 
few. This is reflected in the wait list 
at campus daycare facilities and the 
lack of affordable married housing 
options. This isn’t mere discomfort, 
either. Housing scams are rampant in 
the area (just call any realtor and ask 

about local scams), and young parents 
are being forced to choose between 
putting their children or themselves 
through school.

It’s past time for the University to 

act. They should look no further than 
our local community colleges for ideas 
to help increase the range of services 
available for older students. Instead 
of focusing on finding “America’s 
Next Top Football Coach,” the school 
should have been looking into funding 
for additional childcare services on 
campus, increased flexibility in class 
scheduling (including more evening 
and online classes) and more married 
housing options.

Unless we do something soon, we 

are going to miss out on the unique 
life knowledge that older students 
bring with them. They will be forced 
to go to campuses that recognize the 
changing times 
and are quicker 
to adjust servic-
es. Indeed, one 
could make the 
argument 
that 

the reason for-
profit 
colleges 

are reeling in 
huge numbers of 
students is pre-
cisely 
because 

they cater their services toward non-
traditional students.

Campus diversity needs expansion 

in more traditional areas. Another 
example of this is the lack of inclusion 
of “none” in discussions about reli-
gious diversity.

According to a Pew Research Cen-

ter poll from May 2014, more people 
would be less likely to cast a presiden-
tial ballot for an atheist (53 percent) 
than an adulterer (35 percent), a sep-
tuagenarian (36 percent) or someone 
who has never held public office (52 
percent).

Worldwide, 
there 
are 
record 

amounts of people who identify as 
“non-theist” or “atheist.” In places 
that used to be dominated by reli-
gion, old icons are being pushed away 
and a wave of secularism is coursing 
through the general public. As many 
as 40 percent of the French do not 
believe there is “any sort of spirit, God 
or life force.” On campus, the numbers 
tell a much different story.

A search on Maize Pages for the 

word “atheist” in a club returns exact-
ly one group, the Secular Student 
Alliance. A similar search for “Mus-
lim” returns 10 clubs while a search 
for “Christian” returns 26. You know 
who else only has one club on cam-
pus? Pokemon aficionados (Pokemon 
Maize and Blue). Then again, I would 
hate to cast Pokemon lovers in the 
same light as atheists, because they 
probably get enough flack as it is with-
out that additional baggage. Besides, 
they probably poll better among future 
presidential candidates.

All jokes aside, there’s no rational 

explanation for this lack of non-
religious 
students. 
Atheists 
and 

agnostics bring a uniquely humanist 
approach to the table, free from the 
obligations of religion. Humanists 
are a diverse group, with people 

of 
virtually 
all 

nationalities 
and 

sexual orientations 
comprising 
their 

ranks. 
I 
would 

love to see more 
free-thought and 
secular activities 
on campus. It could 
be something as 
simple as a food 
drive 
for 
the 

homeless, or as complex as a support 
system for helping people overcome 
substance abuse without invoking the 
name of God.

The key is taking the meaning 

of diversity away from the narrow 
definition groups like BAMN get us 
to focus on. Diversity on campus isn’t 
an issue going away anytime soon. 
The quicker we go for true diversity 
of thought and away from the notion 
of diversity as skin color, the better 
off we all are. The University has a 
responsibility to its students outside 
of the classroom to provide access 
to cultures and ideas not found at 
our local high schools. Increased 
diversity, beyond just geography 
and skin color, is one way to help 
accomplish this. Until we focus on 
a more broad definition of diversity, 
we are forever going to be living in 
the shadows of our own past.

O

n my way home to Florida 
this past summer, while 
stopped in Atlanta, I tried 

to get ahold of 
 

Mrs. B.

I had Mrs. B for 

social studies in 
eighth grade, and I somehow got her 
to be my friend during high school 
and college.

She was petite, and she kept her 

gray hair short. She had light blue 
eyes, which is where her smile 
started. She was always very crisp: 
bright but modest solids, cool flo-
ral patterns — a very classic sort of 
South Florida prep that we’ll never 
see again. Her voice was soft and 
carried with it the slightest and 
most dignified Southern drawl. In 
conversation, she was curious, gen-
uinely. Nobody was more interest-
ed than Mrs. B. I thought of her as 
my own personal Terry Gross. But 
better dressed. (No offense to Ms. 
Gross, who I love and who I’m sure 
dresses quite wonderfully.)

I’d heard that maybe Mrs. B wasn’t 

doing so well. I’ve visited her while 
she was dealing with some sort of 
cancer.

She hadn’t said a word beforehand, 

when we made plans over the phone. 
But once during one of our usu-
ally long summer talks, she casually 
dropped it. (We of course covered the 
basics first: “How are your grades?” 
“How is your family?” “Don’t you just 
love Jon Stewart?”) Then eventually, 
“I’ve got cancer.”

And, “But Willie, I’m doing fine.”
Of course I believed her. Because it 

was true. She licked it.

But after a while of being in the 

clear, some blood came back and 
announced a second round with 
something more vicious.

In the airport, I folded up in 

a corner near the outpost of The 
Varsity, an Atlanta standby: the 
“world’s largest drive-in” where a 
No. 2 combo gets you a chili cheese 
dog and a chili cheese burger, fries 
or onion rings and a regular sized 
drink for $9.44. They greet you at 
the counter with a loud, “What’ll 
 

ya have?”

I called Mrs. B to let her know I’d 

be in town.

WHADDAYAHAVE?
“Oh, hello Willie,” Mr. B answers.
WHADDAYAHAVE?
“Is Mrs. B Around?”

WHADDAYAHAVE?
“I wanted to let her know I’m 

headed home today.”

WHADDAYAHAVE?
“I’d love to see her.”
WHADDAYAHAVE?
“Well, Willie. She can’t come to 

the phone right now.”

WHADDAYAHAVE?
“But I’ll let her know you called.”
WHADDAYAHAVE?
“Thanks. See you soon.”
Mrs. B helped civilize me.
In middle school I was a monster.
I had my ear pierced with a little 

silver ball. I wore an Andy Warhol 
messenger bag, so I knew a thing 
or two about art. (But I had no idea 
who the Velvet Underground was.) 
Sometimes I would turn the lights off 
in my room and listen to The Postal 
Service and cry.

I think I called a girl fat on the 

Internet once.

I got C’s and D’s and F’s. Because 

of this, on the night of my best friend 
Jack’s bar mitzvah, I brought my 
dress pants to my mother and asked 
her to iron them. But she had just 
logged on to ParentLink to check my 
grades and told me there was no way 
in hell I was going to Jack’s bar mitz-
vah. I cried, I screamed, I cried more: 
a 
wide-mouth 

weeping, 
running-out-
of-breath, chub-
by-cheeked-me 
pale and reddish 
with baby fat and 
a bad attitude, a 
screaming, sob-
bing heap of ugly.

One day Mrs. 

B started class 
by handing out 
information about a new school 
policy. Because of severe budget 
cuts, students now had to pay for 
printing. The piece of paper that 
Mrs. B handed out stated that from 
now on, copies would cost each 
of us 10 cents per page. This fee 
applied to handouts, exercises and 
even quizzes and tests.

Because we all sat in groups at 

tables, it took a minute for it to catch 
on. But someone finally asked, “We 
have to pay you to take tests?!”

Mrs. B. told us, “I’m sorry, there’s 

nothing I can do. I don’t think it’s fair 
either.”

“But Mrs. Broughton, what about 

students who might not be able to 
afford this?”

A very mature question asked by 

my friend Jack — someone who was 
already a man by this time.

And then I had a quiet realization: 

We’re about to learn about the Boston 
Tea Party. She’s taxing us without 
representation!

I gasped and put my hand straight 

up in the air — ready to ruin the 
whole lesson.

But when she looked over at me, 

she grinned and then she winked, 
acknowledging that I knew what 
she knew.

Back then I was even more of a 

shit-ass know-it-all than I am now.

But that smile, that wink.
Mrs. B silently kept my stupid, big 

mouth closed — and she let me feel so 
grown-up about it.

In that moment, I learned that you 

don’t always have to know loudly. 
Sometimes you can know quietly, 
and you might even be doing all of us 
a favor.

So I smiled back.
I put my hand down and decided, 

instead, to help my class incite 
 

a revolution.

Over the summer I got to see 

Mrs. B just before she died. She 

was there and 
her 
blue 
eyes 

were there and 
her family was 
there. We cov-
ered the bases 
(grades are fine; 
family is fine; 
I still love Jon 
Stewart). And I 
re-told the sto-
ries like the Bos-
ton Tea Party, 

and the History Fair (my friend 
Madison and I wrote a play: we 
were John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 
a hotel bed. We went all the way to 
Tallahassee in bathrobes, carrying 
an inflatable mattress and a tam-
bourine), and we sort of smiled.

And then Mrs. B got tired and 

wanted to rest.

So I let go of her hand and gave her 

a kiss on the cheek.

And she said, “Willie, I am just so 

tickled for you.”

And, “You keep me posted.”

Tuesday evening, emphasizing state and local growth over 
the past four years, community-based reforms and the “river 

of opportunity.” While Snyder’s speech was commendable in its 
recognition of previous achievements and idealistic goals, he neglected 
to expand on the substantial steps needed to create a better future for 
the state of Michigan.

During the past four years, the state has made 

significant improvements as outlined by Snyder. 
Housing values have increased by 25 percent 
compared to the national average of 16 percent; 
out-of-state tourism has increased by over $2 
million in the past four years; the agricultural 
industry has hit an unprecedented benchmark 
of more than $100 billion in economic activity; 
unemployment has decreased to 6.7 percent; 
and over 300,000 private-sector jobs have been 
created in the last four years.

Snyder similarly praised efforts to improve 

transportation with a special focus on 
Michigan’s roads, pointing out that many create 
conditions that are hazardous for driving. Of 
course, improvements to Michigan’s roads are 
severely needed according to Snyder, with one 
in nine bridges in the state being structurally 
deficient. However, Snyder made no mention 
of how the legislature would go about actually 
making these improvements. Furthermore, the 
governor neglected to address the controversial 
M-1 rail, currently under construction in 
Detroit, with an estimated cost of $137 million.

In his speech, Snyder also highlighted 

that since 2010, there has been a 48 percent 
increase in automotive production. While the 
state is currently enjoying the benefits of the 
revived industry, it is important to note that 
it’s unreasonable to rely on the automotive 
industry for economic prosperity. Michigan 
saw the consequences of such dependence in 
the 2008 automotive industry crisis. To pivot 
itself for an economically successful future, the 
state should look to invest in other industries, 
such as science and technology fields.

Snyder’s State of the State included, in 

a large part, the presentation of his “river 
of opportunity” plan, intended to increase 
the ability of Michigan residents to achieve 
multi-faceted 
opportunities, 
including 

educational 
attainment 
and 
economic 

stability. While laying out this plan for 
the state, Snyder harped on increasing the 
efficiency of government and its respective 
programs, many of which he deemed to be 
unnecessary, ineffective and not focusing on 
the “real people” that they are targeting.

In addition to this critique of inefficiency, 

Snyder stated that communities play a 
much larger role in aiding the issues within 
communities, forming a “village of support” 
with 
the 
government 
fading 
into 
the 

background. Snyder stated that the creation 
of 145 new programs since the 1940s has not 
targeted “real people” and has simply created 
inefficiencies within the government that 
aren’t helping the citizens they intended to 
serve. It’s improbable that the majority of 
people would disagree with the statement 
that the government is currently bloated, with 

bureaucratic red tape serving as an impediment 
to progress, but the government can do things 
that a community simply cannot.

While governmental involvement is an issue 

that should be dealt with, the government can’t 
stick to the sidelines when dealing with issues 
such as food availability and access to education, 
especially in regions and communities where 
resources are scarce. Detroit, for example, is 
a food desert, with access to quality food just 
now making its way into parts of the city with 
the construction of new grocery stores. Public 
subsidies and tax breaks were used to make 
these stores, such as Whole Foods, viable, 
bringing down the cost to build locations in 
Detroit. Creating a “village of support” in a 
community such as urban Detroit, one stricken 
with poverty and violence, and expecting 
government to fade into the background while 
that community fixes its own food availability 
crisis is a completely untenable plan. Increasing 
government efficiency should not reduce the 
ability of citizens to get the kind of assistance 
and aid they so badly need in order to make it to 
the “mainstream” of the “river of opportunity.”

Snyder’s only mention of higher education 

was in his discussion on middle colleges — a 
high-school program that allows for students 
to affordably attain a high-school diploma 
and community college degree from the 
same school. His failure to discuss college 
affordability as a whole is neglectful to a 
significant issue facing the state of Michigan 
and country. According to a study by youth 
advocacy group Young Invincibles, Michigan 
ranks as the third-worst state nationwide in 
higher education investment. While Snyder’s 
administration has slowly increased higher 
education funding after it was cut by 15 percent 
in 2011, this ranking reveals deep concerns 
regarding his commitment to fostering an 
educated citizenry. His no-comment during the 
State of the State perpetuates this perception.

Similarly, Snyder’s discussion of energy 

issues lacked the direction it required. 
Snyder mentioned he wanted to eliminate 
energy waste, exploit the state’s natural gas 
resources and focus on renewable energy 
solutions. To do this, he intends to create a 
state energy agency in order to consolidate 
the effort on creating viable energy policy 
for the future. However, he failed to answer 
key questions such as what his plans are for 
natural gas. Whether the plan is to export 
natural gas or invest the resources within the 
state, it’s disappointing Snyder did not outline 
the groundwork for Michigan’s energy future 
appropriately. The lack of details in the State 
of the State address only serve to heighten the 
expectations for Snyder’s special message on 
energy in March.

Bad things happen when acronyms fight.
Important story 
in flawed ‘Selma’

Historical drama 
doesn’t add much to 
the history books

By ZAK WITUS

Daily Arts Writer

In “Selma,” writer and direc-

tor Ava DuVernay (“This is the 
Life”) lifts a page from your high 
school 
his-

tory textbook, 
breathing 
life 

into a single 
episode 
that 

tells a larger 
story. The film 
chronicles the 
events 
from 

Dr. 
Martin 

Luther 
King, 

Jr.’s life, from 
his acceptance 
of the Noble Peace Prize in 1964 
to his speech at the steps of the 
Alabama State Capitol, which 
led to the five-day Civil Rights 
march from Selma to Montgom-
ery. “Selma” presents this inspi-
rational man as a representative 
of the Civil Rights Movement 
as a whole. However, despite 
its social and political value, 
“Selma” is not a great film.

While some people might 

learn something new about his-
tory from this film, the story 
doesn’t extend much beyond 
the history one might find in the 
pages of a high school history 
textbook. The film does a fine job 
representing what will probably 
be familiar material for most of 
us. What’s more, “Selma” does, 
at least to some to some extent, 
subvert the outmoded “great 
man theory” of history that we 
saw in Steven Speilberg’s “Lin-
coln.” Though the film focuses 
primarily on King and his influ-
ence, it also gives credit to what 
in the “great man theory” are 
considered negligible sideshow 
characters. “Selma” emphasizes 

the importance of the people 
who we’re accustomed to see-
ing as just “faces in the crowd.” 
The film recognizes the fact that 
though leaders like King are 
important, it’s ultimately what 
we call “ordinary people” who 
form the basis of popular move-
ments.

Critics who call out “Selma” 

for historical revisionism have 
aimed their attacks at the film’s 
Oscar aspirations. But many 
wonder why it’s even a contend-
er in the first place — except for 
the fact that Oprah Winfrey and 
Brad Pitt produced it. “Selma” is 
not a bad film; it’s just mediocre. 
The violence in the film — the 
police brutality in particular — 
hits hard, provoking disgust and 
anger that galvanizes the activist 
within us. David Oyelowo repro-
duces King’s resounding rhetoric 
and sandpiper suave magnifi-
cently. We’d have to be more cal-
lous than Michael Jordan’s feet 
to not feel the film’s triumphant 
glory resonating from our toes 
on up.

Unfortunately, 
the 
story 

doesn’t expand much on the 
familiar 
historical 
material 

(perhaps its greatest shortcom-
ing). For example, the film tells 
us that Dr. King and Coretta 
Scott King suffered from marital 
strife, but it doesn’t show exactly 
why, and only vaguely alludes 
to it (perhaps to preserve the 
respectability of the film’s pro-
tagonist). What’s more, much of 
the dialogue feels inconsequen-
tial, as if we already knew what 
the characters were going to say. 
Granted, this is a historical film, 
so anybody who read their high 
school history textbook would 
obviously know what the char-
acters were going to say. But that 
only prompts us to see the film go 
beyond the elementary version of 
this historical moment.

Every movie, whether histori-

cal or not, falsifies to some extent; 
that’s part of what it is to be art. 

The question is: What kind of fal-
sification and how much of it are 
we willing to abide?

In a recent op-ed in The 

Washington Post, Joseph A. Cali-
fano Jr., one of President Lyn-
don Johnson’s top assistants for 
domestic affairs, wrote, “The 
film falsely portrays President 
Lyndon B. Johnson as being at 
odds with Martin Luther King 
Jr. and even using the FBI to dis-
credit him, as only reluctantly 
behind the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 and as opposed to the Selma 
march itself.” It’s clear from Cali-
fano’s evidence (which can be 
found in his piece and in the tran-
script of the phone conversation 
between King and Johnson) that 
“Selma” exaggerates the extent 
to which Johnson and King were 
at odds with one another. Listen 
to the phone conversation or read 
the transcript and try to deny 
that Johnson sounds like he’s 
enthusiastically supportive of a 
Voting Rights Act. Understand-
ably, the film would lack a major 
antagonism without the conflict 
between Johnson and King, but 
this is, of course, no ground for 
historical revisionism.

People 
who 
support 
the 

film’s social and political mes-
sage probably want to say it’s 
a better film than it really is, 
and people who oppose its 
message will probably want to 
hyper-focus on the misrepre-
sentation of Johnson to say it’s 
a worse film than it really is. As 
Califano wrote in his criticism, 
“Selma” didn’t need to falsify 
history as it did to create a great 
film. By that same token, we 
can still enjoy the film despite 
its historical inaccuracies. The 
misrepresentation of Johnson 
should deter no one from see-
ing the film because “Selma” is 
nonetheless a provocative rep-
resentation of a well-known and 
centrally important event from 
the Civil Rights Movement that 
deserves to be remembered.

Turnley reflects on 
inspirational career

By FRANCESCA KIELB

Daily Arts Writer

A girl behind me loudly whis-

pers, “This guy is like … a huge 
deal.”

David Turnley, a Pulitzer 

Prize winning photographer, is a 
name often heard throughout the 
halls of the University’s Penny 
Stamps School of Art & Design. 
I heard whispers from students 
in his class on his eccentric 
genius, his passion, his exper-
tise and even his anger. Rumors 
of students fleeing his class in 
tears from harsh critiques cre-
ated mixed associations of fear 
and awe. I welcomed covering 
the Penny Stamps Lecture as a 
chance to see for myself what 
made him tick, hoping to see the 
man beneath the layers of mys-
tique.

Turnley is a storyteller. While 

his medium is photography, he 
is also incredibly eloquent. His 
stories flow seamlessly from 
one unbelievable destination to 
the next. He does not spare any 
details when speaking about his 
accomplishments, yet any hubris 
feels justified for a man who has 
accomplished so much. It doesn’t 
seem physically possible for a 
man to witness so much, much 
less capture it on film.

Turnley starts his story in 

Johannesburg in 1990, where he 
was covering the Apartheid for 
the Detroit Free Press. He then 
gets a call from the Free Press’s 
Director of Photography, telling 
him that Sadam Hussein invaded 
Kuwait and asking him to fly to 
Baghdad to cover the impend-
ing war with America. There’s 
just one problem: no Ameri-
can photographers were to be 
granted visas. While photogra-
phers stayed close to the airports 
awaiting permission, Turnley 
found another way in. He bought 
a ticket for a flight with journal-
ists who were granted visas, and 
snuck through security amid the 
chaos. Once on the plane, how-
ever, the officer went around 
collecting passports and check-
ing credentials. He was ques-
tioned by the officer, expecting 
to be kicked off the plane. How-
ever, when the photographer 
explained that he was working 
out of Detroit, the officer perked 
up. The officer had family in 
Dearborn and allowed Turnley 
to enter. He was the first photog-
rapher to arrive in Baghdad since 
the beginning of the war.

Once there, he faced yet anoth-

er obstacle. American photogra-
phers had to be escorted by Public 

Affairs Officers, who attempt-
ed to control what the media 
exposed regarding the war. No 
images of violence or suffering 
were permitted. Turnley was not 
one to play by the rules, though. 
He sought out an elite mash unit 
of the American Medical Corps 
and asked if he could join them to 
document the war. This unit did 
not have a Public Affairs Officer, 
but he convinced them to let him 
join regardless. This freedom 
gave him the ability to take pic-
tures of the war that ended up on 
the cover of every major publica-
tion nationwide. To the crowd, 
Turnley explained, “to allow for 
serendipity you can’t force things 
to happen, you have to have the 
stamina to really be in people’s 
lives in a full immersion.”

He was later awarded a Pulit-

zer Prize for a series of 19 photo-
graphs at Check Point Charlie as 
the Berlin Wall fell. He explained 
how he had hired a motorcyclist 
to weave between traffic to get 
him to the point in time. Again 
and again, a combination of fate 
and his pragmatic approach 
put him in direct contact with 
moments that defined the 20th 
and 21st centuries.

“I have never felt comfort-

able with the notion of calling 
myself a journalist. I have never 
felt myself to be objective. I see 
through my eyes, my heart and 
my life experience. It is a priority 
to try to be fair, which is why I’m 
trying to touch your hearts with 
the common threads of human-
ity,” Turnley said.

So, who is David Turnley?
David Turnley is:
-The first American photog-

rapher to arrive in Baghdad to 

cover the first Gulf War.

-The only American photog-

rapher in Iraq traveling without 
a Public Affairs Officer — allow-
ing him to document the tragedy 
without governmental restric-
tions.

-One of the first western jour-

nalists to receive visas to 13 coun-
tries in the Soviet Union.

-A witness to the Rwandan 

genocide in the mid-’90s.

-A witness to the fall of the 

Berlin Wall.

-A witness to 9/11, document-

ing the Twin Towers’ fall from a 
block-and-a-half away.

-A family friend and compan-

ion of the Mandela family for 
over 20 years.

But much of his talk was not 

spent on his coverage of memo-
rable events, rather, on his expe-
riences with people all around 
the world, both witnessing and 
joining their walks of life. From 
a homeless man to an aging 
farming couple and professional 
dancers, Turnley stresses the 
importance of building relation-
ships with a diverse swath of 
people.

He summarizes the mantra of 

his life and work by saying sim-
ply, “It’s not a job assignment 
or a vocation. It’s a way of life, a 
camaraderie, a sense of heritage 
— seeing what you can do with 
your camera to make a differ-
ence.”

As the event drew to a close, 

the lights dimmed and he con-
cluded with a slideshow of his 
photographs. The veil had been 
lifted, he had been humanized. 
Yet my feelings of fear and awe 
not only remained — they were 
amplified.

‘Parks’ prepares to 
close on a high note

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

With last season’s incred-

ible, series finale-worthy end-
ing “Moving Up,” it would 
be 
easy 
for 

showrunners 
Dan Goor and 
Michael Schur 
(“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine”) 
to play it safe 
for the final 
season. 
But 

that’s not what 
makes “Parks 
and 
Recre-

ation” one of 
the 
greatest 

television comedies of the last 
20 years. The joy of watching 
“Parks and Rec” doesn’t come 
from the humor alone, but from 
seeing people who love one 
another help each other reach 
their goals. Season seven begins 
by taking all of that love and 

putting it through the grinder.

It has been three years since 

the promotion of Leslie Knope 
(Amy Poehler, “Saturday Night 
Live”) 
to 
Midwest 
Region-

al Director of the National 
Parks Service, and Pawnee 
has changed a great deal. The 
Newport family — antagonists 
throughout the series — are 
selling a huge plot of land, and 
Leslie hopes to convince them 
to turn it into a National Park. 
Unfortunately, there’s someone 
standing in her way whom she 
hates so much as to not even 
mention his name: Ron Swan-
son (Nick Offerman, “22 Jump 
Street”).

After an unexplained event 

ominously 
referred 
to 
as 

“Morningstar,” Swanson has 
left 
the 
Parks 
Department 

and created a new company 
named Very Good Building and 
Development. His client is tech 
startup company Gryzzl, that 
plans on using the land to build 

the “Gryzzl Campus.”

Seeing the hearing where 

Leslie turns around to see Ron 
Swanson greet her with a cold, 
“Hello, Ms. Knope,” felt like 
a stab in the heart. Their dif-
ferent stances on government 
have always been a source of 
tension but it’s never gotten 
in the way of their friendship. 
With season seven, Goor and 
Schur make the viewer feel 
what it’s like for politics to 
divide a family.

The tension is amplified by 

the fact that we understand the 
principles that have led both 
Ron and Leslie to this point 
in time. For such a surprising 
twist, the Ron and Leslie face-
off feels almost inevitable as 
the underlying question of the 
show: What is the role of gov-
ernment? It’s almost absurd 
that such a pressing question 
is more intelligently posed by a 
sitcom than journalists, Nancy 
Grace and politicians. How-

DAVID TURNLEY

But first he took a selfie.

ever, “Parks and Recreation” 
isn’t a soapbox, and showrun-
ners Goor and Schur open this 
final season with gusto and 
wit.

Guest 
stars 
Jon 
Hamm 

(“Mad Men”) and Werner 
Herzog (“On Death Row”) 
make great use of their small 
roles and real-life person-
alities. Recurring characters 
like Joan Callamezzo (Mo 
Collins, “MAD TV”), Tammy 
Two (Megan Mullally, “Will 
and Grace”) and Councilman 
Jamm (University alum Jon 
Glaser, “Delocated”) are also 
excellent, with the latter two’s 
new relationship taking center 
stage for the second episode 
“Ron and Jammy.” Mullally, 
Glaser, and Collins have pro-
vided some of the series’ most 
memorable laughs and it’s 
great seeing them get a last 
minute spotlight as we enter 
the home stretch.

“Parks and Recreation” has 

provided some of the funniest 
and most human moments of 
television of any genre in the 
last 20 years. It has made us 
laugh and cry — often at the 
same time — and it will be hard 
to say goodbye later this year. 
However, it’s also comforting 
to know that the beginning of 
the end was just as special as 
all that came before.

Ekko’s ‘Time’ is 
a dynamic debut

Mikky Ekko steps 
out of Rihanna’s 
shadow on ‘Time’

By GIBSON JOHNS

Daily Arts Writer

Mikky Ekko has a compli-

cated relationship with time. 
On the one hand, he prefers to 
tread 
lightly 

and take his 
time 
profes-

sionally — it’s 
been over two 
years 
since 

he broke out 
as 
the 
fea-

tured 
artist 

on 
Rihanna’s 

slow-burning Top 40 smash, 
“Stay,” and he’s only just now 
releasing his debut album. On 
the other hand, when it comes 
to his rocky relationship with 
love, he’s impatient with time, 
as evidenced by his dark mus-
ings throughout his debut.

It’s clear that with Time, 

Ekko wanted to establish a 
dynamic sound for himself that 
both solidified the one we would 
have previously expected from 
him — the tender, emotional 
voice that worked in perfect 
harmony with the R&B lean-
ings of “Stay” — and brought 
forth newer, less genre-specific 
settings for his voice to explore. 
Though this approach occa-
sionally pays off, more often 
than not Ekko exudes a desire 
to prove he doesn’t fit into one 
Rihanna-established 
mold. 

This unfortunately gets in the 
way of what he does remarkably 
well, which is to croon hurtfully 
about love, time and heartache 
on soaring, midtempo, slightly 
left-of-center pop.

On the title track, “Time,” 

Ekko does just that — over an 
orchestral backing, he uses his 
beautiful falsetto to prove his 
dedication to a rocky relation-
ship. “Time doesn’t love you 
anymore / But I’m still knock-

ing at your door,” he sings on 
the song’s bridge. It’s lyrics 
like these that exemplify his 
standing on the twisted affair 
between time and love. He 
doesn’t believe in waiting for 
a love that has become stag-
nant because he sees waiting 
as harmful to the future of 
romance.

However, he also recogniz-

es the sometimes inescapable 
nature of waiting on “U,” another 
standout track. Over a simulta-
neously ethereal and pulsating 
beat, Ekko acknowledges that 
there is a “long, long road to love” 
and sounds almost as though he’s 
channeling Ne-Yo. “Mourning 
Doves,” another dark midtempo 
track, continues this strong, self-
assured sound but sees Ekko 
start to experiment a bit. Rusty 
screeching is littered throughout 
the verses, which foreshadows 
the change in sound coming in 
the album’s second half.

“Riot” is a call to arms 

against the pressures time plac-
es on love that strays a little bit 

too far into the realm of pop-
rock. “Loner” is a bland, rock-
tinged track that fails to take off 
about (you guessed it) being a 
loner. “Watch Me Rise,” though 
a better attempt at capturing a 
more effective rock sound, feels 
too much like a OneRepublic 
B-side and, thus, is out of place 
on Time.

Ekko’s affinity for experi-

mentation occasionally pays 
off, though — like on the static, 
distorted “Pressure Pills” and 
the twinkling, confident “Made 
Of Light” — and the album’s 
preoccupation with time and 
love provides it with a much-
needed string of continuity. It’s 
clear that Ekko’s struggle to 
accept that waiting for love is a 
necessary evil is one that took 
him a long time — two years, 
to be sure — and for a chunk 
of Time, his struggle is one we 
want to listen to him sing about.

Mikky Ekko has a clear 

wheelhouse that he excels in. 
It’s one that comes in the form 
of a midtempo ballad with a 
dark place, and it’s the same one 
that we heard the first time he 
sang with Rihanna. What’s also 
clear, though, is that Ekko is 
searching to expand upon that 
wheelhouse. Has he found a 
way to successfully do that? Not 
quite, and I’m not really sure he 
needs to. Only time will tell if 
he keeps looking.

2015 set to be a big 
year for blockbusters

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

Film in 2014 seemed to be 

largely about the human drama, 
as movies like “Boyhood,” “Selma” 
and “The Grand Budapest Hotel” 
(all Oscar favorites) told stories in 
a wholly new honest and human 
way. Many of the most critically 
acclaimed films relied on little CGI 
animation, instead opting for a 
more straightforward approach to 
cinematic grace.

2015, however, seems to prom-

ise a different set of riches. Many of 
this year’s heavyweights exist now 
as big-budget, big-stick blockbust-
ers waiting to rake in the millions 
(billions likely) — poised to smash 
box office records and ticket sales 
and reduce last year’s film pool 
into a puddle of rainwater. While 
this is, of course, not a bad thing, I 
predict that 2015 will be a year of 
computerized movie magic – but 
one of the strongest yet.

“The Peanuts Movie”

Though Bill Melendez, creator 

of the original “Peanuts” TV film 
series, passed away in 2008, his 
legacy will thrive in 2015. Melen-
dez’s paramount voice work as 
Snoopy and Woodstock will be 
revived, as director Steve Mar-
tino (“Ice Age: Continental Drift”) 
plans to integrate archival record-
ings of the voices. Produced by 
Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids”), writ-
ten by Charles M. Schulz’s sons 
Craig and Bryan and scored by 
Christophe Beck (“Frozen”), “The 
Peanuts Movie” will deliver all the 
charm and sentimentality of the 
original cartoon with the wit and 
animation effects of the modern 
age.

“In the Heart of the Sea”

Nathaniel 
Philbrick’s 
2000 

eponymous nonfiction book sets 
something astir in the mind of 
director Ron Howard, something 
like confidence. The story’s been 
told and retold a hundred times 
(most notably in Herman Mel-
ville’s 1851 novel Moby-Dick) but 
never with the technological capa-
bilities of today. “In the Heart of 
the Sea” is a nautical tragedy, one 
that speaks to the fear all sailors 

face when confronted by one of 
nature’s most eminent forces: the 
sperm whale. The tragedy of the 
whaleship Essex is, as the trailer 
states, a story about men. And a 
demon.

“Mad Max: Fury Road”

It takes two full plays of the 

trailer to fully grasp everything 
that’s 
happening 
in 
director 

George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury 
Road,” the fourth installment in 
the Mad Max franchise. Specially 
engineered cars tear across the 
Australian desert as music from 
the previous century illustrates 
the terror of their flight. Men with 
facial deformities yell things like, 
“What a lovely day!” as they make 
chemical weapons out of gasoline 
and oil. Explosions, storms and 
strangeness abound in this fantas-
tical flick. Prepare for anarchy.

“Jurassic World”

While Steven Spielberg’s origi-

nal “Jurassic Park” film observed 
a variety of dinosaur species and 
focused mainly on the Tyranno-
saurus Rex, “Jurassic World” will 
look at a few dinosaur species and 
focus mainly on the Velociraptor. 
Chris Pratt (“Guardians of the Gal-
axy”) stars as Owen, a member of 
the theme park’s on-site staff who 
conducts behavioral research on 
the vicious Velociraptor species, 
and who seems to be able to con-
trol them in some way. “Jurassic 

World” will add a more jarring and 
horrific element to the franchise’s 
already thrilling story.

“St. James Place”

Directed by Steven Spielberg 

(“Lincoln”), written by the Coen 
brothers (“No Country for Old 
Men”), starring Tom Hanks (“Cap-
tain Phillips”), shot by Janusz 
Kaminski and edited by Michael 
Kahn (the team that brought you 
the unforgettable reality of “Sav-
ing Private Ryan”). “St. James 
Place” is a spy thriller based on 
the 1960 U-2 Incident. Be ready. Be 
excited.

“The Revenant”

Alejandro González Iñárritu, 

who directed last year’s comedy-
drama sensation “Birdman,” will 
return this year with “The Rev-
enant,” a story about the life of 
American 
frontiersman 
Hugh 

Glass. Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio, 
“Wolf of Wall Street”) was a fur 
trapper and adventurer renowned 
for his exploits in the American 
West throughout the 19th century. 
The film will focus mainly on his 
expedition with Ashley’s Hundred 
(a band of 100 people), in which 
Glass was mauled by a grizzly bear, 
crawled more than 200 miles to 
Fort Kiowa, recovered and sought 
the revenge of those who left him 
behind.

“Avengers: Age of Ultron”

Big budget, big sequel, big 

characters, big action, big stakes.

“Sisters”

Though this film’s premise 

seems to draw a bit (or a lot) 
from the 2008 comedy hit “Step 
Brothers,” it certainly promises 
its fair share of laughs, gags and 
memorable lines. Director Jason 
Moore has made a career on 
Broadway and directed his debut 
film in 2012 with “Pitch Perfect,” 
a combination of music, fun per-
formances and wild theatrics. 
“Sisters” stars Tina Fey, Amy 
Poehler and Maya Rudolph, a trio 
of Saturday Night Live comedi-
ans so funny and so right for each 
other, this film is bound to be a 
home run.

“Ricki and the Flash”

If the writer of “Juno” (Dia-

blo Cody), the director of “The 
Silence of the Lambs” (Jona-
than Demme) and Meryl Streep 
announced that they had a movie 
in the works, would you believe 
them? What would you imagine? 
“Ricki and the Flash” answers 
both of those questions. Streep 
(“Into the Woods”) is set to play 
Ricki, an aging rock star who 
abandoned her family to become 
a famous musician. Ricki’s life 
takes an even greater dramatic 
turn when her ex-husband Pete 
(Kevin Kline, “The Conspirator”) 
asks her to visit Chicago in order 
to help their estranged, divorced 
daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer, 
“Cake”) through a difficult time.

“Star Wars Episode VII: The 

Force Awakens”

You’d think they could come 

up with a better title. J. J. Abrams 
(“Star Trek”), Lawrence Kasdan 
(“Indiana Jones and the Raiders 
of the Lost Ark”), Adam Driv-
er (“Frances Ha”), Oscar Isaac 
(“Inside Llewyn Davis”), Andy 
Serkis (“Dawn of the Planet of 
the Apes”), the entire main cast of 
the original films, John Williams, 
George Lucas and practically all 
the forces of a galaxy far, far away, 
and they come up with, “The Force 
Awakens.” Well, personal qualms 
aside, this film seems to reinvigo-
rate all the themes and tropes that 
made the original trilogy so popu-
lar. I just hope Kasdan and Abrams 
bring back Jar Jar Binks.

‘M’ changes venue for week

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Editor

For 
multiple 
Michigan 

hockey 
players, 
Tuesday’s 

practice was nostalgic. They 
weren’t reminiscing about old 
memories 
at 

Yost Ice Arena, 
but 
rather 

practicing at their old stomping 
grounds: the Ann Arbor Ice 
Cube, home of the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program.

“It brings back old memories,” 

said junior forward Andrew 
Copp. “I spent a lot of time here 
in my life. It’s pretty cool to come 
back and see the people who 
helped me get here. It’s always 
good to be back in your home 
rink.”

Added sophomore forward JT 

Compher: “It’s fun to be back. I 
got to see my old coaches. It was 
a similar drive over from school, 
so it brings back some memories.”

The Wolverines practiced at 

the Cube on Tuesday and will 
again on Wednesday to help 
themselves adapt to a larger 
ice surface, which they will see 
this weekend at Wisconsin. The 
surface caused 
problems 
a 

year ago, when 
Michigan lost 
all four Big Ten 
road 
games 

on larger ice 
surfaces.

Yost 
Ice 

Arena’s 
ice 

surface is 200 
feet by 85 feet, while Wisconsin’s 
Kohl 
Center 
— 
where 
the 

Wolverines will play a two-game 
series this weekend — is 200 feet 
by 97 feet.

Last season, the larger ice 

surfaces proved to be too much 
of a challenge. Michigan lost two 
games at the Kohl Center, 5-2 and 
3-1 respectively, while also losing 

two games at Minnesota on an 
Olympic ice sheet.

To change the trend, the 

coaching staff decided to use the 
Cube — which has three Olympic-
size ice sheets — to its advantage 
and get the team acclimated to 
the intricacies that come with 
playing on larger rinks.

“It’s a really big (advantage),” 

said associate 
head 
coach 

Billy 
Powers. 

“Our 
goaltenders 
and 
our 

defense 
will 

probably 
tell 

you that this is 
going to come 
in handy. Come 

Friday night, there’s going to be 
less of an adjustment and it’ll be a 
nice comfort level.”

Added sophomore netminder 

Zach Nagelvoort: “I don’t think 
that it’s that much tougher. The 
biggest difference is on the power 
play. The team can exploit the 
fact that they can go that much 
farther on the outside. That’s the 

biggest difference I’ve noticed. 
It’s figuring out the different 
angles.”

Due to the bigger rink, one 

line that may be poised for a big 
weekend is that of Compher, 
junior forward Boo Nieves and 
sophomore forward Max Shuart. 
Nieves and Shuart are two of 
Michigan’s fastest players and 
will certainly use the extra space 
to their advantage.

“With the big ice, they can use 

their speed,” Compher said of his 
linemates. “I think if we can use 
that speed and get to the net, we’ll 
have a good weekend.”

NAGELVOORT 
FEELING 

“AMAZING”: Nagelvoort hasn’t 
started a game since Michigan’s 
5-1 defeat at Boston College on 
Dec. 13. However, despite not 
starting, the netminder’s morale 
isn’t low.

“It’s really good,” Nagelvoort 

said of his current state of mind. 
“I couldn’t be happier. I have had 
a lot of good weeks of practice. 
Everyone wants to play every 
night, but the team is doing 
well, right? (Junior goalie Steve 

Racine) has been playing well, so 
that’s great.”

Still, no starter is set in stone, 

and the coaching staff has yet to 
make a decision on who will play 
between the pipes in Madison.

“Terrific, terrific,” Powers said 

of Nagelvoort’s recent play. “I can 
tell you, in these last two weeks, 
I’ve seen a dramatic change. 
All I can tell you is that both 
goaltenders have looked really 
good in practice, and Zach has 
looked really good.”

SINELLI ON DEFENSE?: 

After playing forward up until 
this week, senior Andrew Sinelli 
practiced 
as 
a 
defenseman 

Tuesday due to multiple injuries 
on the blue line.

Freshman 
Cutler 
Martin 

didn’t play last Friday against 
Ohio State due to an upper-body 
injury, and senior Mike Chiasson 
is also out with an undisclosed 
injury.

“He’s been (a defenseman) 

in the past,” Powers said. “We 
wanted to see how he looked, and 
he needs to get some reps there 
in case we need him there.”

Michigan isn’t 
like most teams
S

aturday, freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty entered 
the locker room at half-

time scoreless. For most squads, 
a top-scorer not producing for 
a full half 
would spell 
out defeat.

But the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team isn’t 
like most 
teams.

The 

Wolverines 
don’t 
have one standout player 
to lean on, but that’s OK, 
because a different star 
emerges seemingly every 
game. Saturday against 
Northwestern, that star 
was sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson.

While Flaherty floundered 

during a high-pressure away 
game, Thompson shot 5-of-9 
from long range, scoring 20 
points to compensate for the 
freshman’s uncharacteristically 
low eight points.

“Siera is a tremendous 

shooter,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico told WKTA Radio 
on Tuesday. “But she’s kind of 
been a little 
bit quieter 
this year 
and people 
haven’t talked 
much about 
her, because 
Katelynn 
came in and is 
really picking 
up some 
scoring. Both 
of them, I think, have made 
over 40 threes on the season.

“Siera does so much, but a lot 

of times, it’s quiet, and that’s 
just her personality as well.”

With Thompson’s heroics, 

the Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 
12-5 overall) picked up their 
first road win of the season. 
That’s not to say that no one 
else contributed, though. 
Senior guard Shannon Smith 
and senior forward Cyesha 
Goree scored 20 and 18 points, 
respectively.

Flaherty, Thompson, Goree 

and Smith average more than 
10 points per game, with Goree 
leading the way, with 14.7. But 
in the last three games, Smith 
has averaged 24 points.

Smith stepped up in a big 

way against Ohio State on 
Jan. 17, wowing the crowd at 
Crisler Center with a 36-point 
performance to lead her team 
to a 100-94 overtime win. She 
scored those 36 points against a 
team that had previously upset 
a ranked Rutgers squad by 17 
points.

“(Smith) is really focused 

and really determined to have 
a tremendous senior season,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She brings 
the team with her. Her energy 
and her enthusiasm just brings 
the team along, and she was 
incredible once again and kind 
of willed us to victory.”

Michigan also restrained 

Ohio State’s Kelsey Mitchell, 
the nation’s leading scorer at 
24.9 points per game, to just 
13, thanks to Goree’s stellar 
defensive play.

Despite the Wolverines’ 

recent string of success, 
you won’t find a Michigan 
player atop any statistical 
leaderboards.

But they do have Goree, who 

averages a double-double. They 
have Thompson, who shoots 
over 40 percent from beyond 
the arc. They have Flaherty, 
who takes gutsy step-back treys 
without hesitation. They have 
Smith, who will drop a career-
high 36 points and say “It really 
doesn’t matter if I (had had 
zero points), I’m just happy we 
got the victory.”

Because the Wolverines 

aren’t like most teams.

If Mitchell were to get 

injured today, Ohio State would 
have to completely alter its 
game plan.

But for Michigan, there isn’t 

a single setback that would 
completely spoil the team’s 
chances at a tournament run. 
Sure, if one of the leading 
scorers had a season-ending 
injury, there would be 
drawbacks, but nothing the 
Wolverines couldn’t combat. 
Someone else would be there to 
step up.

If Goree was injured, there 

would certainly be a drop-off 
in rebounds, but scrappy senior 

forward 
Nicole 
Elmblad 
would still be 
able to grab 
boards. Even 
the 5-foot-7 
Smith has 
averaged 4.6 
rebounds per 
game.

And when 

it comes to scoring points, 
Michigan definitely doesn’t 
have a problem. Most games, 
four Wolverines end up in 
the box score with more than 
10 points. But the fear of not 
producing drives Michigan, 
too.

“When we see that other 

kids are really improving, 
we want to reward them and 
give them the opportunity 
for pushing themselves and 
doing the things that we ask,” 
Barnes Arico said Dec. 19. 
“If somebody else becomes 
complacent, we’re going to 
switch it up, just so they know 
that there’s always that chance; 
it keeps everybody hungry.”

With that attitude, it’s 

no surprise that there are 
plenty of worthy players on 
the bench who haven’t seen 
much playing time. Freshman 
forward Jillian Dunston could 
step in for Elmblad, or junior 
guard Madison Ristovski 
could effectively play in place 
of sophomore guard Danielle 
Williams.

As of late, Michigan has been 

benefiting from its deep roster.

The Wolverines have beaten 

rivals Ohio State and Michigan 
State at home, and of their 
five losses, three came against 
against ranked teams.

But the Wolverines have 

moved past those losses. 
They’ve realized they’re not 
like most teams.

Wolverines prep for rapidly 
approaching Opening Day

Michigan picked 
fifth in Big Ten 
preseason poll

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

In its 2014 campaign, the 

Michigan 
baseball 
team 

finished 30-29-1. But 11 of its 
29 losses were by just one run, 
with many of them coming early 
in the season. Compounding the 
issue was the fact that much of 
the team’s success rested on the 
shoulders 
of 
underclassmen, 

who 
were 
unfamiliar 
with 

playing at the collegiate level.

Encouragingly, had it won 

all of those one-run games, the 
team’s final record would have 
been 48-18-1 — on pace with 
reigning conference champion 
Indiana. Even if it had won 
around half of them, the team 
would have rested at a solid 
36-29-1.

The team has trended upward 

in each of its three seasons 
under coach Erik Bakich, and 
some believe this is the year 

that the growth will show the 
most on the field. But one of the 
earliest conference rankings 
of the year, from b1gbaseball.
com, projects the Wolverines to 
finish fifth in the Big Ten — one 
spot lower than their fourth-
place finish last season.

“I honestly don’t care if 

we’re first or fifth (in the 
preseason poll),” Bakich said. 
“I told the guys that rankings 
are something we can’t control, 
so we’re not going to pay 
attention to it when we’re not 
receiving votes, just like we’re 
not going to pay attention to it 
when we’re in the top 25 later 
this season.”

Last year, those one-run 

losses were billed as learning 
experiences, but now it’s time 
to see what actually stuck. With 
much of the leadership weight 
up for grabs, the underclassmen 
will be called on to step up as a 
whole.

The 
experience 
and 

leadership will be key, as the 
Wolverines will also have to 
contend with a much different 
landscape 
than 
in 
recent 

years. This is prompted by the 

addition of two solid programs 
in 
Maryland 
and 
Rutgers, 

along with increased parity 
among traditional conference 
powerhouses, 
like 
Indiana, 

that are projected to finish 
somewhere other than at the 
top of the standings.

Michigan doesn’t have much 

time to figure out what its 
winning formula will be this 
year. The team’s first three 
weekends of conference play 
feature matchups against the 
projected 
first, 
second 
and 

fourth-place teams: Maryland, 
Nebraska 
and 
Indiana, 

respectively.

Another major challenge the 

team is facing is the amount 
of time it’s able to spend 
working as a group. NCAA 
regulations have kept players 
and coaches from doing much 
training together since mid-
December, meaning a good 
chunk of the winter has seen 
players doing more self-policed 
individual workouts. On Jan. 
23, the allowed time expands 
to 20 hours of organized team 
training per week, with coaches 
being able to work on more 

group-based 
concepts 
and 

traditional practice.

“(The amount of time for 

team practices before opening 
day) is much shorter than 
Major League Baseball’s spring 
training, so the onus is on 
individual players to have a 
training regimen over holiday 
break,” Bakich said. “Our guys 
are self-motivated, and really 
strive to improve. They’ll be 
able to come back and hit their 
stride very quickly.”

Working on both individual 

and team skills is especially 
important 
for 
players 
like 

sophomores Jackson Lamb and 
Hector Gutierrez, who will 
specialize in one position rather 
than play multiple, as they did 
during their freshman seasons.

Lamb started in the outfield 

for the Wolverines 29 times in 
2014, but he will exclusively 
be a pitcher in 2015, according 
to Bakich. Coming out of high 
school, Lamb was clocked in the 
upper 90s from the mound, but 
he wasn’t able to pitch often last 
season due to a back injury. He 
figures to be a key component 
of the Wolverines’ bullpen this 
year.

In 
a 
similar 
situation, 

Gutierrez was listed as both 
a pitcher and infielder last 
season, but he will only play in 
the field this year. This change 
is much more cosmetic, as he 
only pitched in two games while 
playing more frequently in the 
infield.

Whether it’s because of the 

team’s winter workout habits 
or simply having another year 
of 
experience 
under 
some 

of the young players’ belts, 
the coaching staff is looking 
for the on-field product to 
come together rapidly for the 
Wolverines this month. Opening 
day is quickly approaching, and 
with the team being put to the 
test right away on the road for 
seven straight weeks to open 
the season, it will have to hit the 
ground running.

Managing Editor

It didn’t matter that the 

message was obvious, a bit 
cliché, maybe even overdone 
in the days leading up to the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team’s first game following 
junior guard Caris LeVert’s 
season-ending foot injury.

Aubrey 
Dawkins 
was 

listening.

In his first career start, the 

freshman guard answered his 
coaches’ call for a “next man 
up,” and then some. Dawkins 
scored 11 points, one shy of 
tying the team high, on 4-for-
8 field-goal shooting Tuesday 
night to propel the Wolverines 
to a 54-50 victory at Rutgers.

Among 
Dawkins’ 

contributions was a crucial, late-
game 3-pointer from the corner 
to cut the Scarlet Knights’ 
lead to three before Michigan 
topped off the comeback with 
a 20-10 run in the game’s final 
eight minutes.

His on-the-mark shooting 

notwithstanding, 
one 
of 

Dawkins’ 
more 
impressive 

plays was his decision to pass 
up an open look at a 3-pointer 
following a missed trey attempt 
from 
senior 
guard 
Spike 

Albrecht.

Dawkins wisely opted to 

leave the ball for Albrecht near 
mid-court. Albrecht then ran 
the shot clock down and found 
senior forward Max Bielfeldt for 
his own open look at a 3-pointer. 
Bielfeldt 
converted, 
giving 

Michigan a six-point lead with 
just three minutes remaining.

“It 
was 
a 
close 
game,” 

Dawkins said. “I didn’t want to 
rush into another 3, especially 
because I had missed a long one 
previously.”

Plagued by health issues in 

recent weeks, the Wolverines 
struggled through a first half 
in which sophomore forward 

Zak Irvin was confined to the 
bench by two personal fouls. 
Freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
also removed himself from the 
game due to illness.

As a result, Michigan coach 

John Beilein used a slew of 
rarely seen players in the first 
period.

Sophomore 

forward Sean 
Lonergan 
entered 
the 
game 

with 
13:33 

remaining 
in 

the first half, 
recording 
two 
points 

and a defensive rebound in 13 
minutes.

In a surprise move, sophomore 

guard Andrew Dakich checked 
in with 12 minutes to play in 
the first period. Dakich had yet 
to appear in a game this season, 
and 
Beilein 
had 
previously 

announced he would redshirt.

“(Dakich) had told me a 

couple weeks ago about burning 

the redshirt, because he thought 
he could help the team,” Beilein 
said. “We double checked and 
we double checked and we 
double checked, and he wanted 
to do it.”

Even 
sophomore 
guard 

Derrick Walton Jr. was limited 

by a nagging 
toe 
injury 

on his right 
foot, but he 
still led the 
Wolverines 
in 
scoring 

with 12 points 
on 
2-for-8 

shooting 
for 

the field. Both 

field goals were 3-pointers, and 
the rest of Walton’s points came 
on 6-for-6 shooting from the 
free-throw line.

“I thought he was shooting 

not to miss instead of shooting 
to make,” Beilein said. “He 
had a look-off of a play and we 
directed him to shoot it. Then 
next time he hit a shot.”

While Walton has shown 

signs 
of 
being 
Michigan’s 

defensive keystone in recent 
weeks, he wasn’t able to control 
the flow of the Rutgers offense 
singlehandedly, and man-to-
man defensive coverage wasn’t 
always an option.

Beilein often opted for a 

2-3 zone look on defense, a 
departure 
from 
Michigan’s 

more typical man-to-man and 
1-3-1 alignments, to compensate 
for his shorthanded squad’s lack 
of size and experience.

“I think we just go with 

whatever matches up best with 
the opposing team’s offense,” 
Dawkins said. “If it’s not a 
great-shooting team, it’s a good 
option for us.”

Rutgers converted on just 

19 of its 53 field-goal attempts, 
a shade under 36 percent for 
the game. The Scarlet Knights 
struggled from the line, too. 
Free-throw shooting accounted 
for more than the difference in 
the final score — Michigan shot 
12-for-14 from the line while 
Rutgers went 7-for-14.

GOOD KNIGHT
Henry bonds ‘M’ 
after home meet

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan coach James Henry 

brings out the best in his athletes 
when they are familiar with their 
surroundings. During his post-
meet team talk Saturday at the 
Simmons-Harvey 
Invitational, 

Henry made every athlete with 
parents in attendance stand up 
and introduce them to the team.

“I try to make all the student-

athletes on the team inclusive,” 
Henry said. “I try to get 
everybody 
in, 

the parents in, 
because that’s 
what 
makes 

everybody 
comfortable. 
If the kids feel 
comfortable 
about 
each 

other, 
they’ll 

feel the same 
about 
their 

performances.”

Track and field is a highly 

individualized 
sport. 
When 

athletes step onto the track, 
they set goals around personal 
records 
and 
individual 

accomplishments.

Henry wants to change that 

definition. He wants his athletes 
to be comfortable on and off 
the track, and that starts with 
making the individualized sport 
a team one.

“Individual and team growth 

is success,” Henry said. “If 
you define success as winning, 
everyone is going to lose except 
one person.”

Henry’s mentality has already 

reaped its benefits early in the 
season. 
Michigan 
won 
five 

events and had 13 athletes post 
personal 
records 
Saturday. 

Henry 
doesn’t 
want 
those 

personal achievements to go 
unnoticed. He asks his team 
after every meet if it has any 

“shout-ins,” an opportunity for 
team members to share their 
best moment of the day.

“You gotta say where you’re 

at,” Henry said. “You got to be 
willing to say ‘I did a good job,’ 
or you got to say ‘I did a crappy 
job.’ You got to internally know 
where you’re at and be willing 
to share, because that’s what life 
is.”

Just like any family, Henry 

says 
his 
team 
has 
to 
be 

constructive with one another. 
Following ‘shout-ins,’ he asks the 

team if it has 
any 
“shout-

outs” 
about 

the 
athletes’ 

performance, 
positive 
or 

negative.

Saturday, 

teammates 
recognized 
one 
another 

for 
their 

personal 

records, but there was some 
criticism of the Wolverines’ lack 
of enthusiasm on the sidelines. 
Henry said the team needs to 
improve on having energy off the 
track, and believes the “shout-
outs” are the best reminder for 
the team to try and fix these 
problems constructively.

“Having individual growth 

is something you need,” Henry 
said. “But it also helps if 
someone’s 
saying 
something 

nice about you or knows what’s 
going on with you, and to me 
that’s just as important.”

While his athletes still may 

focus 
on 
developing 
their 

individual 
times, 
distances 

and 
heights, 
Henry 
always 

makes sure there is always a 
focus on growing as a team. If 
there’s anyone who’s as proud 
of the athletes on the track as 
the parents, it’s the coach who 
guides them everyday.

“You gotta say 
where you’re at 
... because that’s 

what life is.”

WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD

Hua, Steinberg 
bring fresh faces

Freshman Hua 
wins at No. 4 

singles in coach 
Steinberg’s debut

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

One impacts the game with 

a racquet. The other impacts 
the game with a clipboard. But 
one thing is clear: Both are 
changing the Michigan men’s 
tennis team in their own way.

Coming off a fall season 

in which he posted a team-
best 6-3 record, freshman Leo 
Hua drew high expectations 
from first-year coach Adam 
Steinberg.

As the Wolverines faced 

off against Western Michigan 
Tuesday 
night, 
Hua 

didn’t 
disappoint.

Hua 

defeated 
Broncos 
junior Ruben 
Greiner at the 
No. 4 singles 
position, 
easily taking 
the first set, 
6-1. The second set proved to 
be more of a challenge, as Hua 
found himself in a 0-3 hole. 
But the freshman bounced 
back, exhibiting an effective 
combination of both power and 
precision to win the second set 
6-4.

“(In the first set) I thought I 

had to be consistent,” Hua said. 
“I started taking time away, 
and he was just missing. I broke 
him really quick, went up 3-1 
and ran away with the first set.

“In the start of the second 

set, I got broken. I was less 
aggressive, 
and 
when 
I’m 

defending I’m not as good of a 
player.”

Ultimately, 
Hua 
found 

his stroke and became the 
aggressor, helping contribute 
to Michigan’s 6-1 win over 
Western Michigan.

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

performance was impressive 
even on paper, one thing didn’t 
make it into the box score: the 
team’s camaraderie, something 
that lacked last season. In his 
first year at the helm, Steinberg 
knew that had to change. And it 
showed.

Throughout 
the 

meet, 
exclamations 
of 

encouragement rang through 
the Varsity Tennis Center, 
and cries of “Let’s Go Blue!” 
drifted up to the rafters, urging 
the Wolverines onto victory—
exactly what Steinberg wanted 
to see.

“My philosophy for 26 years 

is that college tennis is about 
playing for each other, is about 

making 
your 

teammates 
better,” 
Steinberg 
said. 
“Team 

first, yourself 
second. That’s 
what we work 
on 
every 

single day in 
practice.”

Steinberg 

stressed 

that a team mentality is vital 
to move the program in the 
right direction. Specifically, 
he expressed his desire to 
put Michigan on the national 
tennis scene and to capture 
Big 
Ten 
championships. 

Though the Wolverines have 
a young team, highlighted by 
individuals like Hua, Steinberg 
revealed that the team still has 
great potential.

“I want them to become great 

team players,” Steinberg said. 
“We play for the University of 
Michigan. It’s not about you, 
it’s about playing for this great 
university. Once they (learn 
that), our program will go 
through the roof.”

Michigan rolls WMU in opener

Petrone paces 

Wolverines to easy 

home win

By SYED FAHD AHSAN

Daily Sports Writer

If Tuesday’s meet is any 

indication, the Michigan men’s 
tennis team has a lot to smile 
about.

In 

their first 
meet 
of 

the 
dual-

match season, the Wolverines 
took on Western Michigan. 
Michigan won, 6-1, to claim its 
13th straight season-opening 
win.

Sophomore 
duo 
Tyler 

Gardiner and Kevin Wong, 
taking on the Broncos’ Stephen 
Payne 
and 
Matt 
Hamilton, 

made quick work in their match 
in doubles play, going up 4-0 
early on and taking the set 6-2.

Seniors Alex Petrone and 

Michael 
Zhu 
had 
similar 

success, winning their set 6-3 
and breaking the Broncos twice 
along the way. Petrone and 
Zhu’s win sealed the doubles 
point, leaving the third doubles 
match contested by freshmen 
Runhao Hua and Carter Lin 
incomplete.

“Me 
and 
Michael, 
we’ve 

been playing together for four 
years,” Petrone said. “We know 
how to play together, and I love 
playing with him. We feed off 
each other, and we played really 
well.”

Despite 

not being able 
to finish his 
doubles match, 
Lin got things 
going for the 
Wolverines 
early in singles 
play. Lin took 
the first set 6-4, and easily won 
the second set, 6-2.

Michigan went up 3-0 when 

Hua proved too much to handle 
for Bronco Greiner. Hua won 
the first set 6-1, but the second 
proved to be more complicated. 

Greiner went up 3-0 early on, 
but despite the setback, Hua 
ended the match in two sets and 
won 6-4.

Western 
Michigan’s 
lone 

point came courtesy of Matt 
Hamilton, who beat Wong in 
straight sets. Hamilton broke 
Wong early on in the first set 
and went on to win it 6-4. 
The second set proved more 
interesting, with both players 
trading breaks. Wong recovered 
from a 4-1 deficit to even the set 
at 5-5, only to lose 7-5.

At the No. 3 

spot, redshirt 
freshman 
Alex 
Knight 

won his first 
set 6-4, and 
sealed 
the 

match 
in 
a 

second-set 

tiebreaker.

“I wasn’t playing too well,” 

Knight said. “But I knew if I 
stayed composed, and kept 
playing my game, I’d come out 
on top. He held a lot of deuce 
points, and I had a few too. But, 

we were both serving well. It 
was tough to break, so the score 
was pretty close.”

Knight’s 
success 
in 
a 

contested match is rare for a 
player in his first college game. 
His match showed why he is 
Michigan’s lone ranked player.

“Highest-ranked, 
but 

definitely not the best,” Knight 
said. “That distinction goes to 
Alex Petrone. I don’t know why 
he’s not ranked, but just wait 
two weeks and he’ll definitely 
be top 50.”

Petrone’s first set proved to 

be a long ordeal, but he came 
out on top courtesy of a 9-7 
tiebreaker. He won the second 
set overwhelmingly, 6-3.

“I just played every point the 

best that I could,” Petrone said. 
“His serve was really strong, and 
I just had to get a return back to 
try and control the game. It’s 
interesting with deuce scoring 
because you never know what 
to expect — it’s a sudden-death 
point. But the second set was 
easier because I got a rhythm 
going and knew what to expect.”

2B

We get it. Winter in Michigan sucks. Here are a few simple ways to 

improve your mood this winter.

THE LIST

1. GO SCREENLESS
We know, we know, it seems nearly impossible. But taking your eyes off the 
LCD for just an hour, whether to take a walk or read a book, gives your brain a 
break and might even help grant you some greater perspective.

2. ESCAPE FOR A MOMENT
On the flipside, when you are stressed escapism can be a good thing. 
“Friends” episodes are only 23 minutes long and accessible on Netflix — take 
a few minutes to laugh a little and forget about your stress.

3. DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES
Yes, that eyes-closed/“ohm”/free-your-mind kind of stuff. It may sound New 
Age-y, but spending a minute or two willfully avoiding the outer world can 
calm your mind and body. 

4. CUT ONE THING OUT
Take a look at your week. Figure out which plans and responsibilties matter 
to you and which can wait. Cut just one thing out of your schedule. It will help 
you organize your thoughts, and de-clutter your life.

5. KNOW THAT IT’S HARD
Sometimes stress is stress. Shit is scary and life is hard. Embrace it. Laugh 
at yourself, screw up if you have to. Recognize that things aren’t perfect, and 
then take a minute to write down all the things that are good in your life. It 
might just help.

5 WAYS TO DESTRESS THIS WINTER

Wednesday, January 21, 2015 // The Statement

January is the month for resolu-

tions.

For many Americans, this means 

renewing gym memberships, order-
ing a new pair of sneakers, and dust-
ing off the basement treadmill. In 
my effort, I turn to the Nike run-
ning app on my phone, which has 
been dormant during the first half 
of winter, in hopes of getting in 
shape for the Ann Arbor Half Mara-
thon in March.

Weight loss is perhaps the prima-

ry motivating factor for individuals 
getting back into running, but run-
ning also promotes strong bones, 
muscles and cardiovascular health.

Those who have made the com-

mitment to bettering themselves in 
this new year are working against a 
wave of growing health concerns in 
our country.

Currently, more than one-third 

of U.S. adults and one-fifth of U.S. 
youths are considered clinically 
obese. Half do not meet the pro-
fessional 
recommendations 
for 

aerobic exercise or physical activ-
ity. About one-in-five smokes ciga-
rettes. And the Centers for Disease 
Control reports that over 9 percent 
of the U.S. population suffers from 

diabetes.

All told, about 117 million Amer-

icans have a chronic health condi-
tion, according to the CDC.

With such staggering health con-

cerns, it’s hard to understand why 
the majority of well-intentioned 
New Year’s resolutions seem to 
fail so tragically by the third week 
of January. As in many aspects of 
American life, our priorities tend 
not to align with our best interests.

But let me put it into another per-

spective.

Every time an American is diag-

nosed with diabetes, or cardiovas-
cular disease, or asthma, or cancer, 
it costs money. If those individuals 
happen to be covered via govern-
ment programs such as Medicare 
or Medicaid, then the taxpayer is 
fronting at least part of the bill.

Recently, reforms have kicked in 

to try and combat the rising costs. 
Some physicians and health care 
companies can now receive reim-
bursements from health insurers if 
they are able to maintain a registry 
of healthy patients.

This prospect should make fun-

damental sense to physicians and 
health providers. Instead of being 

paid to fix the problem, they receive 
payment for preventing the problem 
from occurring in the first place.

But that couldn’t be further from 

the case.

The average clinic visit for a 

healthy patient — a 20-minute 
affair — nets the hospital a couple 
hundred dollars. However, car-
diac surgeries can easily fetch 
$200,000.

This disparity is reflected in 

medical training. While a fam-
ily practice physician might expect 
to earn about $180,000 by mid-
career, a general surgeon can earn 
$350,000.

So when federal reforms seek 

to provide incentives for reducing 
costs, it seems they neglect some 
of the blatant financial dispari-
ties present in the current system 
— doctors get paid to treat sick 
patients, not healthy ones.

And many, such as Public Health 

Prof. Richard Hirth, have noted 
that these reforms leave out one 
critical element: the patient. In fact, 
our current system provides a nota-
ble lack of incentives for patients to 
stay healthy.

As we approach the last week of 

January, many Americans will have 
already fallen away from their New 
Year’s Resolutions and reentered 
the socio-economic quagmire of 
junk food and idle lifestyle promot-
ed in our country.

But for those that remain moti-

vated and committed to daily exer-

cise and good nutrition, they are 
doing the country a financial ser-
vice by staying at arms length from 
our health care system — free of 
charge. 

Let’s all make a resolution to be 

supportive.

Wednesday, January 21, 2015 // The Statement 3B

Becoming a Townie: An afternoon in the Arb

I have a confession to make: I’m a 

little superstitious.

I check my horoscope every week 

on the Seventeen Magazine website 
and trust the failing teen publica-
tion’s judgment a bit too much.

The people you’ll be getting close 

to will be pals.

Blindly trusting the wisdom of 

some editorial intern, I prepare to 
become friends with certain indi-
viduals I’ve been talking to lately.

I sound insane, I know. But 

believe me, it doesn’t stop there.

My watch is my comfort object 

and, if I don’t have it, my life is com-
pletely out of order. It’s not a fancy 
watch by any means. It’s dark and 
round-faced with a thin band — 
unnoticeable and insignificant at 
first glance.

Every morning, before leaving 

home, it is the last thing I put on. In 
my mind, the only way I’m physi-
cally able to walk out the door is if 
it’s on my wrist. Leaving for class or 
work without it just feels wrong.

The second-hand stopped work-

ing about a year ago and the minute 
hand lags by three minutes, so it’s 
not in the best of conditions.

But this watch brings me good 

fortune. I’ve worn it to every ACT 
test I took in high school and it was 
permanently attached to my wrist 
when I was writing my application 
to the University.

I believe the fact that I’m writing 

this column for The Michigan Daily 
is proof — kind of — that this watch 
works. 

As a 21st century college student, 

it’s a bit humiliating to admit that 
I’m willing to suspend some dis-

belief when it comes to horoscopes 
and good-luck charms. But I guess 
it’s genetic.

My grandparents regularly con-

sult a “professional” astrologist 
themselves. He visits their home 
once a month, debriefing them on 
what course their lives, their chil-
drens’ lives and their grand-child-
rens’ lives will take.

Now I’m not completely crazy, 

I’m not willing to put misguided 
faith onto the alignment of the Uni-
verse.

I, the astrologer told me five years 

ago when I last visited my grandpar-
ents, will become a scholar. Now, 
I don’t know if the stars weren’t 
aligned in a perfect semicircle or 
Venus was blocking Mercury’s 
shadow, but there is a possibility 
that the astrologer’s calculations 

were incorrect; I barely passed Cal-
culus last semester.

Now my grandparents aren’t 

fools. Their astrological consulta-
tions are rooted not in a deeply held 
belief of the occult, but in a faith. 

“Good omens are important,” I 

remember my grandmother saying 
to me. “They show you the right way 
and help guide you.”

Sure, I didn’t end being a scholar, 

but I still think about the astrolo-
ger’s prediction and in some way it 
wills me work harder on my school-
ing.

My tendency to take Seventeen’s 

cautions into consideration is not 
only because of my grandparent’s 
influence. By keeping track of my 
horoscope and wearing my watch I 
feel like I’m a bit more in-control of 
my life.

If I can foresee the challenges I 

may face and — thanks to the assis-
tance of Seventeen — if they do turn 
out to be true, I’m comforted by the 
fact that I’m ready to face them.

STATE OF THE UNION:
BRINGING BAMA BACK

ON THE 
RECORD

“We still live in a country where too many bright, striving 
Americans are priced out of the education they need. It’s 

not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.”

– President BARACK OBAMA at the State of the Union 

address Tuesday night
Into the woods, into the woods.
Standing on the Diag, surround-

ed by the chaos of the college envi-
ronment, some students might be 
surprised to learn that not far from 
the hustle and bustle of our con-
crete campus they have the ability 
to experience acres of preserved 
forests and waterways.

The Nichols Arboretum is a 

University-controlled park, offer-
ing wide-open space where stu-
dents and Ann Arbor residents can 
run free — free to be you and me. 
Just like in the ‘70s TV special — a 
Marlo Thomas-Michael Jackson-
Gloria Steinem collaboration that 

I’m sure all true Ann 
Arborites cherish as much 
as I do — it is a invigorat-
ing departure from the 
rest of the city.

The tranquil Peony 

Garden 
and 
rushing 

Huron River may imme-
diately come to mind 
when you hear about 
the Arb. But the hills 
made clear and barren 
by winter’s harsh hands 
and the canvas of falling 
snow is something from a 
12-year-old’s dream.

Recently, I joined a group com-

prised of (almost) 20-somethings 
to venture out amid single-digit 
temperatures in exploration of the 
great outdoors. We each represent-
ed fields of study so varied that we 
might have been a group of Univer-
sity orientation leaders.

I found it a curious feeling to 

walk out of a class on the Arab-
Israeli conflict to feel the prickling 
wind stinging my cheeks and a sen-
sation of flight and everything the 
world once seemed to be: open and 
wild, forgiving and terrifyingly 
vast — yet unknowingly narrow — 
all at the same time.

As so many before us had, we 

slid down hills on recycled boxes, 
dining hall trays, and $5 sleds. We 
rustled through paths and wore 
borrowed snowshoes that still held 
the dust of the attics from which 
they were retrieved. 

We heard and felt silence. The 

buzz from someone’s new Tinder 
match was masked by the thick 
snow apparel we had donned, and 
our laptops were nestled in their 
cases at home. While rumor has it 
that a few lucky graduate students 
get to live buried away within the 
Arb’s grounds, the mystery house 
wasn’t found on this particular 
adventure, but there is always next 
time. 

And there will be a next time, 

though I hope to be wearing shorts 
instead of three pairs of leggings.

Only a select few make it to the 

Arb this time of year. Maybe the 
townies know better than to leave 
their toasty abodes this time of 
year, but remembering that the Arb 
does indeed exist and experienc-
ing it in all seasons is a great way 
to remind yourself that a world 
beyond Ann Arbor — and beyond 
the Diag — exists too.

Editor’s Note: Some names have 

been changed to protect the privacy of 
individuals mentioned in the article.
M

aria is sitting on her bed, 
telling me about her medi-
cation. She is lying on her 

side with her head propped onto her 
right arm and her hand immersed in 
her long black hair. She has a freshly 
poured bowl of Fruit Loops in front 
of her. She apologizes in advance for 
eating while she talks, but she doesn’t 
want the cereal to get soggy. She isn’t 
wearing pants, just underwear, and 
I can see her hipbone jutting out. 
When she was at rehab for two weeks 
over the summer, staff members had 
to follow her into the bathroom to 
ensure she wasn’t bulimic.

“This is my natural body weight,” 

she says.

I believe her, but when I wrap my 

arms around her I worry she might 
break.

Maria’s room is a Candyland of 

designer clothes and scattered fur-
niture. Two months into the school 
year, she is still in the move-in pro-
cess, and shelves, dressers and boxes 
all line the floor of her bedroom 
helter-skelter. On a newly-built shelf 
adjacent to Maria’s bed rests a two-
foot-tall bong.

Next to this, Maria manages her 

own private pharmacy. Bottles of 
Klonopin, Seroquel, Lomictal and 
Vyvanse lie in a row. The Seroquel is 
new. She opens the lid and turns the 
bottle upside down, letting the pink, 
shockingly tiny pills fall into the cap.

“It’s smaller than my birth con-

trol,” she notes.

Maria is not the only American 

with a hefty collection of medica-
tions. Roughly 7 in 10 Americans are 
taking a prescription drug. A sizable 
portion of these drugs treats mental 
illness, the two most prevalent of 
which are depression and anxiety.

Anxiety is the most common 

mental illness in the United States, 
affecting 40 million Americans, or 
18 percent of the population. Depres-
sion is a close second — 19 million 
Americans have depression in a 
given year, and the lifetime risk of 
becoming depressed is 17 percent, 

according to the Anxiety Disorders 
Association of America.

Where there is illness in America, 

there is medication. Data shows 1 in 
10 Americans take an antidepressant, 
a drug used to treat both depression 
and 
anxiety. 

For women, this 
number is clos-
er to 1 in 4.

Maria 
is 

playing 
with 

a twiddler — 
a 
worm-like 

green necklace 
she bought at a 
drugstore. She 
has trichotillo-
mania, meaning 
she obsessively 
pulls out her 
hair. Her bald 
part-line 
is 

twice the thick-
ness it should 
be, 
because 

that’s where she prefers to uproot 
the black strands of keratin from 
their homes. She does this because 
she suffers from severe anxiety.

“I try and wear a hat all the time, 

but I also try and have something in 
my hands.”

As we talk, Maria repeatedly for-

gets about the twiddler and absent-
mindedly 
sticks her fin-
gers into her 
hair. 
When-

ever she does 
this, I silently 
hand her the 
twiddler.

Maria 
had 

good 
rea-

son to see a 
psychiatrist. 
She has been 
arrested twice 
— both times 
for assaulting 
a 
cop. 
Both 

while 
black-

out.

Her second arrest is what got her 

sent to rehab for drug and alcohol 
abuse. Since then, Maria has been 
diagnosed with Bipolar II Disor-

der. This is much less scary than 
it sounds, as Maria makes sure to 
inform me.

“I’ve never had a state of mania 

like a real bipolar person would,” she 
says. “Other than when I’m blackout 

drunk. That’s mania.”

Given her past, Maria’s diagno-

sis seems neither surprising nor 
inaccurate. Still, the pill bottles on 
her shelves draw my curiosity. The 
Klonopin treats her anxiety. The 
Lomictal and Seroquel act as mood 
stabilizers. The Vyvanse helps her 
focus.

She refers to herself and her psy-

chiatrist in the collective when she 
discusses why she takes all of these 
pills. In particular, the Lomictal no 

longer seems necessary now that she 
has been prescribed Seroquel.

“We don’t know what would hap-

pen if I got off it,” she says. “It’s not 
doing anything bad.”

Over the last decade, it has become 

more 
and 

more com-
mon for col-
lege-aged 
women 
to 

be on the 
types 
of 

medication 
that Maria 
takes. 
The 

chance 
of 

a 
major 

depressive 
episode 
in 
18 
to 

29-year-
olds is three 
times high-
er than in 
individuals 

60 years or older, according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders.

Most of these episodes occur 

in females. A quarter of American 
women take a drug for a mental 
health disorder, compared to 15 per-
cent of men. The ratio of women to 
men on anti-anxiety meds is 2 to 1.

For many 

of my female 
friends, 
it 

began 
with 

anxiety. 
They 
went 

to a psychia-
trist because 
they 
were 

too anxious 
to 
function 

normally, 
and 
were 

ultimately 
prescribed 
either 
an 

antidepres-
sant or an 
anti-anxiety 

medication. From there, most were 
eventually labeled with a term like 
bipolar or clinically depressed.

“It’s important to not let the labels 

bother you,” Maria tells me, taking a 
bite of Fruit Loops. “All it is is a label 
for your symptoms.”

I ask Maria if she always knew 

she had a mental illness. The short 
answer is yes.

“I was really an angry kid, I did 

not have a great childhood.”

She sticks her fingers in her hair.
“It looked picture-perfect, but a 

picture-perfect family is usually not 
a close family.”

In my mind, I contrast my own 

experience with Maria’s. I grew up 
in an extraordinarily tight-knit fam-
ily. My father and mother spoiled me 
endlessly, and my three best friends 
— my sisters — were never more than 
a bedroom away.

Every day of my childhood, my 

father took my sisters and me on 
different adventures, like the movie 
theatre or the arcade or the park. 
He called these outings “secret mis-
sions.”

There was even a secret mission 

song (which I have now discovered, 
to my disappointment, is actually the 
James Bond movie theme). When 
we got home, my mom would brush 
our hair and take our coats off for us, 
then heat something up for dinner 
(she is an awful cook).

Growing up, I went to the same 

private school for eight years, but 
when I walked out of those heavy 
iron doors for good, I had made few 
close friends. My sisters and my par-
ents were my best friends.

When I started my freshman year 

of college, I left my family members 
behind. My older sister didn’t go 
away to college. I was the first one, 
and I had no idea what I was in for. 
At school, I felt completely alone. My 
family was only 45 minutes away, 
but it might as well have been light-
years. I had no one close to me, and 
no idea how to let someone get close 
to me. I missed my family terribly.

All I could think about was how 

my life would never be the same 
again, how it would never be good 
again.

I stopped eating. I stopped sleep-

ing.

I thought about death and dying 

constantly, and I cried all the time. 

This went on for months.

Despite some of my peers’ con-

cerns, I never sought professional 
help. I was sure if I told a therapist 
what I was going through, he or she 
would try and convince me to take 
medication. The concept of taking 
a pill to make me happy made me 
uncomfortable. It reminded me of all 
the books I’ve read where the main 
character gets brainwashed, and 
suddenly she’s lost all her individual 
thoughts. She becomes the minion 
of some generic Disney-type villain 
who has an odd hairstyle and gives 
long monologues about his evil plans.

I used to tear through these types 

of books. Experiencing my favorite 
character lose the ability to think for 
herself gave me a sick sort of pleasure. 
It would almost be freeing, I thought, 
to have someone else controlling you, 
thinking for you. I didn’t want to be 
prescribed antidepressants because 
I wasn’t sure I could resist. I wasn’t 
sure I could stop myself from tak-
ing one of those tiny pink pills that 
would wipe my sadness blank.

When Marilyn Gilbert returned 

my phone call, she was elated for the 
chance to get to know me. She left me 
a voicemail: “I have seen your photo 
in your dad’s office, so I have kind of 
already met you.”

A patient in my dad’s internal med-

icine practice, Gilbert, who holds a 
doctorate in psychology, verifies the 
rumor that doctors need doctors too.

Over the phone, her voice sounds 

like a character from Sesame Street. 
It maintains a softness, like she is 
teaching a child, but it is comforting 
rather than condescending.

As she talks, she continually uses 

examples drawn from tennis. I smile, 
realizing she knows I’ve played the 
sport my whole life.

Gilbert says she believes antide-

pressants are overprescribed, par-
ticularly to teenagers.

As a psychologist, Gilbert does 

not have the ability to prescribe the 
medication herself. What she can do 
is help to wean her young patients off 
antidepressants when she finds them 
unnecessary.

“It becomes a real problem for a 

lot of the college-age kids that are on 

them,” she tells me. “They’re embar-
rassed. They don’t want people to 
know, and they begin to worry it’s 
interfering with other functions.”

In place of drugs, Gilbert pre-

fers to trigger our body’s natural 
medication 
— 
endor-

phins. 
Endorphins 
are endog-
enous 
opioid neu-
ropeptides. 
Essentially, 
they’re 
our body’s 
built-in 
drug path-
ways meant 
to 
induce 

pleasure 
and relieve 
pain.

There 

are 
mul-

titudes of healthy ways to trigger a 
spike in endorphins: eating a good 
meal, exercising, getting enough 
sleep. Even seemingly superficial 
pleasures like eating dark chocolate 
or getting a massage will increase 
endorphins. High endorphin levels 
make people happier, reducing the 
need for antidepressants.

In some 

cases, 
though, 
drugs 
are 

necessary 
to 
treat 

depression, 
namely 
when 
the 

depression 
is 
defined 

as 
“clini-

cal.” 
But 

the 
line 

between 
clinical and 
non-clini-
cal can be 
fuzzy.

You can’t take a blood sample and 

tell if someone is depressed or not — 
you have to have a conversation.

Gilbert draws the clinical depres-

sion line based on two factors: inten-
sity and duration.

“How bad is it, and how long have 

you been struggling with this?” she 
asks her patients.

Questions of intensity and dura-

tion get at the larger question — is 
your depression so powerful that 
you can’t function? Inherent in this 
criterion is the idea that humans are 
supposed to be sad sometimes. It 
wouldn’t be natural if we were never 
anxious, angry, or upset.

“A good case of the blues, and 

dealing with loss and life changes is 

part of being alive,” Gilbert says.

If your mental illness is not harm-

ing your life in any tangible way, it’s 
not a mental illness. It’s a feeling.

Some instances of clinical depres-

sion stand out to Gilbert. These 
patients’ stories seem rehearsed, as if 
Gilbert has recalled them repeatedly.

One story is of a Michigan State 

University student who took a semes-
ter off, in part due to her depression. 
Every morning, she would run her-
self a hot bath, and stay in the bath-
tub for hours. She couldn’t convince 
herself to get out.

“The longer she stayed in the tub, 

the harder it was to get out and face 
the day,” Gilbert says.

The next story is of a man who 

compared living his life to “walking 
in glue.”

She pauses and takes a slow breath: 

“When someone says that to you, 
you get a pretty good image of how 

hard it 
is to get 
through 
each 
day.”

Raina 

sits 
across 
from me 
in 
one 

of 
the 

study 
rooms 
in 
my 

apart-
ment 
build-
ing. She 
usually 
texts me 

every morning, but she didn’t answer 
my texts for three days leading up to 
her interview. She’s dressed up to her 
usual hipster standard — a red-plaid, 
sleeveless collared shirt buttoned up 
to her chin, dark-wash blue jeans and 
black combat boots with silver studs 
on them. She kicks the boots off and 
they rest, homeless, under the table.

The 

room 
is 

entirely 
white. 
White 
walls, 
white 
table, 
white 
chairs 
— 
the 

blank, 
empty 
kind 
of 

white 
that 
is 

almost 
reflec-
tive 
in 

its uniformity. It’s the color of the 
Elmer’s glue kids use for their pre-
school art projects. The door of the 
small, square room is closed, and it’s 

so quiet that I can hear Raina’s slow 
breaths echo off of the erased walls.

Raina is on Zoloft, an SSRI or 

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibi-
tor. SSRI’s are by far the most com-
mon type of antidepressant. They 
work by increasing your brain’s lev-
els of Serotonin, a mood-elevating 
neurotransmitter.

At the beginning of her sophomore 

year, Raina decided she wanted med-
ication for her anxiety. She had tried 
regular talk therapy, and she says 
it didn’t work for her. From a psy-
chologist’s point of view, Raina was 
a textbook candidate for medication: 
her anxiety was interfering with her 
everyday life.

“It was happening all the time,” 

she tells me. “I would feel awkward 
participating in class … Random stuff 
like that.”

Raina’s dark brown hair is pulled 

back, a typical style for her, and she 
plays with her ponytail as she talks. 
I watch her cleave the hair that 
is trapped in her hair tie into two 
strands with her fingers, then pull in 
opposite directions, tightening the 
ponytail.

“I was unhappy for no reason.”
I watch her loosen her ponytail 

and bring her hair over one shoulder.

“There would be fun things going 

on and I would still be overly emo-
tional about everything and overre-
act to things.”

When Raina first began to feel 

anxious, she turned to the Univer-
sity’s resources for students with 
mental health concerns. She went 
to Counseling and Psychological 
Services, which provides University 
students free mental health care, for 
individual therapy sessions to psy-
chiatry appointments.

Outside of the door of its third 

floor Michigan Union office, there 
is a wooden board with block let-
ters that say “Stop Student Suicide.” 
There are about 20 hooks nailed into 
the board with handwritten notes 
hanging from them. I don’t stop to 
read the notes as I walk in.

There is a rumor at the Univer-

sity that, if your roommate commits 
suicide, you get straight As for the 
semester. The rumor has such dark 
implications that I can’t fathom how 
it continues to seep through college 
freshmen like water spreading on a 
dry paper towel. Maybe it’s because 
everyone imagines it’s just a rumor 
— that no one’s roommate will ever 
actually commit suicide.

But they do, I think to myself as I 

stare at those words.

Stop Student Suicide.
Suddenly, I am 16 years old again. 

It’s morning, and my parents are 
talking in hushed whispers outside

onfidence is an elusive savior.

It comes when you’re most vulnerable, when 

you’re staring at the underside of a black velvet cur-

tain waiting for it to part, as you’re praying the lights will 
be bright enough to distract you from the hundreds of eyes 
staring right back at you. It tiptoes into your consciousness 
and assuages your doubts with a comforting whisper. Hey, 
you’re gonna be really good at this. The voice quiets just as 
the lights blast your face. You’re alone, but not really.

The performance was a blur, because all you can remem-

ber is the feeling of all those eyes watching you. They paid 
attention. They witnessed your greatness and your genius 
themselves. Yes, genius. You’re not exaggerating. You fuck-
ing killed it. You’re pretty sure somebody called you the 
next Kate Winslet, and you’re not at all concerned that 
maybe you kinda made this up. You’re awaiting a call from 
the Darien Doings, because you know the small-town news-
paper is definitely gonna do a profile on their hometown 
hero/star. Can you convince your parents to let you move to 
Hollywood? Is this how Kate Winslet got started? That little 
voice never shuts up, and it tells you to chase more, more, 
more opportunities to stand with those lights on you and 
force everyone to listen.

I’ve known since I was a kid that I wanted to be an actress. 

Check my fifth-grade yearbook, and under the picture of my 
chubby, bespectacled little self, you can find a caption say-
ing that I wanted to be a “dolphin trainer and a movie star” 
when I grew up. But that yearbook is a dumb liar, because I 
didn’t just want to be an actress. I wanted to be an actress, 
with every fiber of my heart and soul and being.

But I mostly kept quiet about those ambitions, bottling 

up all my schemes in my head like some diabolical movie 
villain. I auditioned for smaller roles in elementary school 
plays, choosing to let my star dim and allow the lesser 
beings to showcase whatever lame talent they had to offer. 
I was biding my time, waiting for my big breakout role to 
come along. But that little voice always crept around, whis-
pering that I was better than all these fools and deserved to 

be the one in the sparkliest costume.

My childhood best friend was a natural onstage, her 

singing talent carrying over into charismatic acting. Where 
I had the precise and methodical brilliance of a Winslet, 
she was a bright and charming Julia Roberts, lighting up 
every stage she walked on. She didn’t actively seek out lead-
ing roles, but they always happened upon her. She rarely 
had to audition, and people approached her to star like she 
was the only natural choice. Cleopatra in our fifth-grade 
ancient Egypt pageant. Rosie in “Bye Bye Birdie.” Mary 
in our church’s Christmas play. Meanwhile, I stood in 
the background, a seething Christmas Angel plotting her 
revenge.

See, I knew I was never going to play Mary. I was kinda 

intense and not a particularly smiley or maternal 12-year-
old. Objectively speaking, even though I had far more tal-
ent than my competition, casting me as Mary would be a 
mistake. But then I got to thinking. What Christmas role is 
perfect for a stoic and flat-chested kid? I was sick of being an 
angel, singing in a chorus with two other girls who picked 
their noses and didn’t read for fun. I was sick of being 
lumped together with losers when I should be the one with 
the lights on her face, the one the whole audience stared at.

I was cast as Joseph, father of Jesus Christ. (Also, none of 

the boys were interested, but I like to think I’d have gotten 
the part anyway.)

In my biblical headdress and cloth robes, you could hardly 

tell that the father of the Lord and Savior was being played 
by a vaguely Jewish little girl. I practiced diligently with my 
best friend, who was — surprise, surprise — Mary again. We 
really listened to one another, bouncing back flawless per-
formances as a realistic husband and wife. In my free time, 
I taught myself to cry on cue, because even though nobody 
in the audience would be able to see the minutiae of my 
facial performance, I couldn’t realistically act out the birth 
of my son without shedding a hard-earned tear. When the 
time came to actually perform, I did so without abandon or 
embarrassment. I was an amazing Joseph, and as I let go of 

that practiced single tear, I knew the audience was weeping 
at the vastness of my raw talent, and could care less that I 
was a girl.

Some friends and family may tell you that this perfor-

mance was the highlight of my career. They’re probably 
right. After I hung up my Joseph robes at age 15 (when even 
the loosest garments couldn’t hide the fact that I was defi-
nitely a lady), I mostly retired from the stage. I liked to think 
that inherent desire to be in the spotlight was a silly child-
hood dream, akin to my yearbook wish of being a dolphin 
trainer.

But I missed it. I tried to channel the same confidence I 

had onstage to other areas of public performance and failed 
every time. As I’d walk up to the podium at a Model UN con-
ference to address the general assembly about the impor-
tance of nuclear power development in Kazakhstan, I’d look 
out again at those hundred eyes staring right back. There 
was no drama, no curtain pulling back, no bright lights. 
Here, people cared only about the words I said, not how I 
said them. I couldn’t be great. With my heart pounding and 
voice cracking, I addressed the assembly and wished I had 
the comfort of everything being pretend.

I had to get that feeling back. Confidence, or maybe 

something greater. Maybe the feeling of being truly great 
at something.

It strikes you when you need it most. Sitting at a desk 

behind another black curtain, dressed in a blazer and heels. 
You know there are probably 200 people sitting in the audi-
ence, but you’re not nervous. You let the energy feed you, 
fill you with light and squash your nerves until they’re 
imperceptible. The feeling is indescribable, but you can only 
compare it to leaving your own body. You aren’t yourself 
anymore. You could be anyone, everyone.

You become like one of those stage lights, a shining object 

that grows brighter with each smile and each laugh. This 
might not be where you belong, but it’s where you need to 
be. Somebody might tell you you’re the Next Tina Fey. The 
little voice in your head tells you anything is possible.

Personal Statement: My elusive savior

by Chloe Gilke, Managing Arts Editor


T

here are only a few memories I can recollect vividly 
from elementary school. One particular incident has 
stuck with me since second grade. My best friend 

Lauren and I were sitting at a table during indoor recess, and 
a boy in my class walked up to us and called me a girl.

There were a few things about this event 8-year-old me 

couldn’t quite comprehend. First, I had short hair and wore 
boy clothes (not to mention had a penis), so the only thing 
making me “a girl” by his standards was that I hung out with 
them. If he hangs out with his dog does that make him a 
golden retriever? And what about being a girl was supposed 
to crush my spirit so badly? My best friend was a girl and she 
seemed to be doing OK.

His “insult” really bothered me. Not because I was offend-

ed, but because I didn’t understand why that was the best he 
could come up with. If I had the extensive vocabulary I had 
now, I would have turned to Lauren and said, “Who cares 
what that misogynistic ass thinks?”

Looking back, I think of it as the day I became a feminist. 

Clearly, I was not walking around Switzer Elementary burn-
ing bras, but the attitude was certainly there.

It is true that girls mature faster than boys; for that rea-

son, my friends were predominantly girls. My male peers 
were interested in sports, video games, and naked women. I 
played soccer, but didn’t live for it. Wii was fun for a while — 
N64 still slays. I could appreciate the beauty of women, but I 
didn’t sit around drooling over them.

I should point out that not all boys were like this, but it 

seemed like the majority were either obsessed with boobs 
or books. Don’t get me wrong; boobs and books are cool and 
all, but I felt many of the boys at school needed to broaden 

their horizons. It took until high school to find boys who I 
really enjoyed hanging out with. Even before then, I wasn’t 
yearning for dude friends; I was happy with who I chose to 
surround myself with.

I wasn’t hanging out with girls for who they were physi-

cally. I was hanging out with female friends because we 
had nice conversations and laughed together all the time. 
The conversation one table over about who got a hand job in 
seventh grade didn’t interest me. There simply just weren’t 
a lot of people who I found stimulating, so I stuck with the 
friends I had.

But even though I was happy, other people in school 

found me hard to understand. The “girl” comments were 
continually sprinkled through elementary school, and then 
in middle school those were upped to my all-time favorite: 
“Are you gay?”

No, slackers of suburbia. I was not gay when you asked 

last week, and if you ask tomorrow I still won’t be.

Despite the confidence I had in who I was, comments 

from others built up feelings of frustration inside of me 
throughout middle school and the beginning of high school. 
It took a friend adding me into a Facebook group discussing 
gender issues to really help me form my own feelings into 
beliefs: I was/am a feminist. I had always shared articles on 
social issues on social media and my friend thought I would 
fit in well with that community. It turns out I did. We share 
articles and thoughts and opinions. It is welcoming. It is 
interesting. It is intelligent.

All along I had one of the first steps down: I didn’t get 

caught up with boys vs. girls in the way much of today’s 
youth does (and can we blame them with most activities, 

toys and interests being labeled with a specific gender?). I 
have an amazing group of people surrounding me. I’m not 
concerned with whether someone identifies as a boy or a 
girl. I’m concerned with what they bring to the table: loyalty, 
empathy, humor, and insight.

As I got out of the hell that is middle school, everyone else 

started to catch up. I know what I stand for and myself bet-
ter than ever. I will throw my thoughts into a conversation 
or share an article, anything to share the freedom I feel with 
knowledge. A small mind is only captive to its owner.

But, even now in college, not everyone gets it. I am still 

posed with stupid remarks and questions. “Oh, you took that 
one Women’s Studies class, now you’re a feminist.” Nope, 
not how it works.

“Are you a feminist because you listen to Beyonce?” No. 

*eye roll*

She is the queen and I agree with much of what she stands 

for, but no, she did not turn me into a feminist.

I am a feminist. Everyone should be a feminist. It’s not 

simply about women; it is about everyone. It is about power, 
intelligence and opportunity. It is about making a world that 
is great for everyone. A man doesn’t surrender his masculin-
ity by declaring himself a feminist.

I wish I could meet second-grade-me, mess up my hair 

and say, “It’s OK, everyone else will get it eventually.” I have 
friends that are girls and friends that are guys, but that is not 
what matters. What matters is that they are all great human 
beings with their own unique talents, senses of humor and 
endless other qualities that make me so grateful to have them 
in my life. It’s the realization that those standards apply to 
all people, regardless of gender, that makes me a feminist.

Personal Statement: Owning my feminism

by Christian Kennedy, Daily Arts Writer

Wednesday, January 21, 2015 // The Statement 
7B


my bedroom. Anna, my older sis-
ter, is 18. She drives me to school 
and seems unashamed of the white 
hospital bracelet that clings to one 
of her sticky, taped up wrists. No 
one will tell me what is going on 
but I find out anyway because the 
blood is all over the place. She cut 
too hard this time.

When I approach the woman 

working at the CAPS front desk and 
tell her I am there to interview Dr. 
Lindsey Mortenson, she tells me to 
have a seat. I imagine she is about to 
schedule me an appointment with a 
therapist.

You’re here as a reporter, I keep 

repeating to myself, but I’m not 
convincing anybody.

Heat begins to seep through my 

skin and crawl into my soul like 
a worm eats its way through an 
apple. It’s so hot that I worry my 
sweat will flood the room, lifting 
all the chairs off the rug and mak-
ing them float down the hallway 
like ghosts. The room is completely 
windowless, and every surface is 
covered with its own sickening 
shade of purple. The walls are lilac, 
the seats magenta, and the carpet 
violet. None of the other students 
seem to mind, though. Everyone is 
well dressed and complacent. We 
could be waiting to board a cruise.

Just as I am beginning to get 

seasick sitting in purgatory, Dr. 
Mortenson comes to my rescue.

Dr. Mortenson is a psychiatrist, 

meaning she is licensed to pre-
scribe medication. Four floors up 
from the Union basement’s Subway 
restaurant, her office perpetually 
smells like $5 Foot Longs.

Like the rest of CAPS, Morten-

son’s small workplace lacks a win-
dow. She gestures to a mirror on the 
back wall.

“That’s my window,” she jokes, 

sadly.

Impressive degrees line the 

walls, including a medical degree 
from Columbia University.

We make small talk for a second, 

and then she asks me to have a seat 
in one of two squishy gray chairs, 
positioned across from one anoth-
er. Sitting, I can’t shake the feeling 
that I am a patient and Mortenson 
is about to prescribe me medica-
tion. We speak in soft, intimate 
voices, and my questions sound 
almost like guilty confessions.

When I ask, “What are the cri-

teria you use to prescribe medica-
tion?” I could be admitting, “I’m 
having trouble sleeping.”

Usually, 
patients 
come 
to 

Mortenson because they’re already 
considering the option of medica-
tion. By the time a patients are sit-
ting across from Mortenson in one 

of those comfy gray chairs, many 
have already tried other approach-
es, like going to talk therapy, eating 
better and working out more.

“Usually by the time I see them 

those changes have not been work-
ing and they are pretty symptom-
atic,” Mortenson says.

Mortenson’s job is to diagnose 

the patient with a disorder and then 
decide what medication would be 
most appropriate for that particu-
lar patient.

I ask her whether this process is 

difficult.

“Not really,” she says, shaking 

her short blonde hair from side to 
side.

The DSM-V — Diagnostic and 

Statistical 
Manual 
for 
Mental 

Disorders — lists specific criteria 
for every type of mental illness. 
Mortenson makes her diagnosis 

based on a checklist.

When I ask Mortenson if she 

ever tries to talk her clients out of 
taking medication, she says no. The 

way she sees it, that is not her job. 
Her job is to help people.

“If you have a medicine or proce-

dure to help somebody, you do it.” 
she says, her blue eyes shining like 
morphine stars. “What would that 
mean to withhold treatment that 
we know works for a lot of people?”

I try to see Mortenson as a vil-

lain for prescribing drugs so freely, 
but I can’t. I think about my father. 
When I call him with an ear infec-
tion or a headache or a sore throat, 
he brings me medicine. He never 
tells me that drugs are not the 
answer or that I should try other 
methods first. He just treats the ill-
ness.

In the 2013-2014 academic year, 

CAPS had 20,000 mental health 
care appointments. It’s no coinci-
dence that University therapy cen-
ters like CAPS see so much action. 

College is a huge stress inducer.

“It’s a tough time in life,” Mari-

lyn Gilbert, the psychologist, had 
told me. “There’s a lot of pressure to 

succeed and be academically pres-
ent and to get a job and see what 
your life situation is.”

For the most part, students 

beginning college are also away 
from their normal social support 
system — friends, families, doc-
tors — for the first time. This loss 
is extremely challenging for many 
students and can act as a trig-
ger, especially for those who have 
already been struggling with their 
own mental health.

Additionally, there is much, 

much higher substance use during 
college years compared to other 
periods of life. Binge use of alco-
hol, weed and other drugs is stan-
dard practice on college campuses. 
It is easy for a student to turn to 
substances when they are feeling 
down. And it’s also extremely dan-
gerous.

“Alcohol is a depressant,” Gilbert 

said. “It’s tempting because it takes 
away the bad feelings, but it really 
adds to the depression.”

Playing into all of these factors 

are the raging hormones associ-
ated with one’s late teens and early 
twenties.

“It’s a time when your body is 

developing, and there are a lot of 
hormonal issues that come into 
play,” Gilbert said.

Young women have much higher 

levels of sex hormones than young 
men, causing their moods and feel-
ings to be much more affected by 
hormonal changes. This is partly 
why a much greater number of 
young women struggle with mental 
health disorders than men.

At the University, Maria drinks 

more alcohol and smokes more 
weed — the size of the bong in her 
room attests to this fact — than she 
did in high school. All of her manic 
episodes have occurred while she 
was extremely drunk, and these 
episodes ultimately led to her diag-
nosis with bipolar disorder.

In contrast, Raina was affected 

more by the lack of social ties she 
experienced when she first came 
to college. As a freshman, she was 
going to Michigan State practi-
cally every weekend to visit her 
high school boyfriend. She went to 
CAPS initially due to loneliness.

“I was having trouble making 

friends because I was gone all the 
time,” she told me.

I think of my own sadness at the 

start of college, how unbearable it 
was. I can’t blame Raina for want-
ing medication when the feeling 
remained strong a year later. For 
me, the depression had ebbed over 
time. At least a little bit.

It’s 2 a.m., and I’m lying in bed 

trying to sleep, but I can’t stop wor-
rying about Maria. When I stopped 
by her room after tennis practice, 
she was clearly under the influence. 
Whether it was from her hefty 
stash of weed, her meds or some-
thing else, I can’t say, but she told 
me the Klonopin was making her 
all wobbly (“I just like, wobble. I 
don’t fall”).

She was going through a hard 

break-up, which was partially why 
I visited her.

While we had been talking, she 

stuck her right arm out toward me 
with her palm facing up, like a child 
sticks out her tongue after just fin-
ishing a lollipop. Slashed across her 
wrist like ink were three bright red, 
lateral slits.
