For most of the Spring 2021 

graduating class, it has been 
over a year since entering the 
Big House for a football game 
or anything else — other than 
maybe to receive a vaccine. On 
Saturday, May 1, however, the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
gave 

graduates 
the 
opportunity 
to 

spend the last moments of their 
college 
career 
watching 
the 

virtual commencement ceremony 
with their peers inside Michigan 
Stadium at noon.

The University said it required 

students who opted-in to the 
in-person 
commencement 

viewing to be adequately masked 
and socially distant, restrictions 
that were essentially not enforced 
once students entered the stands 
Saturday. Graduates also had to 
have 
a 
verified 
ResponsiBLUE 

screening 
and 
testing 
result, 

which, for students who have 
not tested positive for COVID-
19 in the last 90 days, includes 
receiving a COVID-19 test at a 
University testing location. 

Students who did not feel 

comfortable 
attending 
the 

in-person event or who wanted 
to watch the commencement 
ceremony with family and friends 
had the option of attending 

virtually. The recorded ceremony 
remains available for viewing.

Despite 
another 
pandemic 

graduation celebrated with new, 
socially 
distanced 
traditions 

— including a massive mural 
on E. Washington St. — several 
graduates and parents were upset 
by the lack of a more conventional 
commencement experience.

Following 
the 
University’s 

initial 
announcement 
in 

February 
indicating 
Spring 

Commencement would be virtual, 
a group of students and parents 
stood in front of the Michigan 
Union in early March to protest 
for what they envisioned could be 
a safe, in-person event.

Along 
with 
the 
protest, 
a 

student-curated 
petition 
with 

over 5,000 signatures urged the 
University to offer an optional 
in-person graduation ceremony. 
The petition claimed that the 
Big 
House’s 
seating 
capacity 

of 107,601 people would allow 
for all interested graduates to 
participate, 
even 
with 
social 

distancing protocols.

When 
U-M 
first 
indicated 

that commencement would be 
virtual, the state’s limitation was 
250 people for outdoor events. 
By 
contrast, 
when 
the 
plans 

for a hybrid graduation were 
announced over a month later, 
the state of Michigan’s restrictions 
held capacity at outdoor events to 

1,000 people if all attendees were 
six feet apart and wearing masks.

In light of the controversy 

surrounding the virtual graduation 
format, University President Mark 
Schlissel announced the May 1 
opt-in commencement celebration 
at the Big House at the Board of 
Regents’ meeting on March 25.

LSA graduate Justin Pollack, 

who attended the celebration, 
expressed frustration with the 
hybrid format but also said he 
understood 
the 
University’s 

decision 
to 
hold 
graduation 

virtually. 

“It’s 
the 
closest 
thing 

that I could get to in-person 
graduation,” Pollack said. “The 
situation 
in 
Michigan 
three 

weeks ago wouldn’t have looked 
good for an in-person graduation, 
and if you did change (the 
graduation format) then I guess 
there would have been a lot of 
logistical difficulties. So, I get it. 
It’s disappointing, but like, I’m 
glad that we have something.”

As 
student 
body 
president 

Amanda 
Kaplan 
introduced 

Schlissel to the crowd, he was met 
with a litany of boos. Despite the 
jeers, Schlissel congratulated the 
class of 2021, citing their resilience 
and 
optimism 
throughout 
an 

unprecedented year.

Pioneer 

High School 
investigated 

for racial 
hostility

On Feb. 22, six Ann Arbor 

City 
Council 
members 
and 

Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
sent 

a letter to Ann Arbor Public 
Schools, advocating for a return 
to 
in-person 
classes. 
Though 

the letter could be perceived 
as 
unconventional, 
as 
school 

decisions beyond the allocation 
of funding are usually considered 
outside the council’s jurisdiction, 
the council members and mayor 
wrote 
that 
they 
were 
simply 

responding to their constituents’ 
needs. Specifically, the letter cited 
“BIPOC 
communities” 
suffering 

an “unjust disparity in loss” during 
the pandemic.

When local Black Lives Matter 

activist and founder of Survivors 
Speak Trische’ Duckworth read the 
letter, she questioned that claim. 
Where 
were 
councilmembers, 

she wondered, when dozens of 
community members came out 
to demonstrate against alleged 
racism at Ann Arbor Pioneer High 
School (AAPS) — when Black 
parents told them they needed 
their support?

“At a time where they were 

needed 
most 
in 
the 
district, 

when … there was so much racial 
unrest within the district against 
students, they would not step in,” 
Duckworth 
told 
The 
Michigan 

Daily in February.

Graduates from the class of 2021 gather in-pperson to view the virtual commnecmement ceremonies at the Big 
House Saturday afternoon.

 BECCA MAHON/Daily

Ann Arbor Public Schools opened 
an investigation into alleged racial 
discimination at Pioneer High School, 


Reggie Bee, the University of 

Michigan’s 
unofficial 
campus 

corgi, has lived a life as rich and 
fulfilling as any canine companion 
could aspire to, said Ann Arbor 
resident and owner Michael Sola. 
He laughed upon recalling Reggie 
chasing deer through Zion National 
Park, swimming in the ocean off
 

the coast of Naples, Florida and 
being Sola’s ‘personal lucky charm’ 
in Las Vegas.

Still, more than anywhere else, 

Sola said the 10-year-old red and 
white Pembroke Welsh Corgi left 
his pawprint on the University and 
in the hearts of its students. Besides 
his frequent frolics on the Diag, 
Reggie was infamously entered in 
the 2018 race for CSG president, 
portrayed 
Paulette’s 
pampered 

pooch Rufus in Musket’s ‘Legally 
Blonde’ and made the cover of The 
Daily’s own The Statement. 

“It was just one of those perfect 

matches, like the marriage you 
always want,” Sola said. “Reggie 
and the University students, it’s a 
perfect marriage.”

With 
roughly 
8,000 
friends 

and followers combined on his 
Facebook and Instagram pages, 
Reggie is considered “the biggest 
celebrity to regularly walk the 
streets of Ann Arbor,” and taking 
a picture with him is number eight 
on the University’s pre-graduation 
bucket list. The last time Reggie 
was on campus, however, was Dec. 
17, 2020, and he passed away soon 
after on Dec. 20.

According to Sola, Reggie was 

clearly not feeling well the night of 
Dec. 19. The next day, Sola dropped 
him off at the veterinarian’s office, 
unable to go into the building with 
Reggie 
due 
to 
COVID-related 

restrictions. Ten minutes after he 
had driven away, Sola received a 
call from Reggie’s doctor with the 
news Reggie had just passed away. 
The cause of death is still unknown.

Sola said he was so shocked and 

hurt by Reggie’s sudden death that 
he was unable to publicly break 
the news until his recent Facebook 
post on Reggie’s page April 23.

“It was just too hurtful to even 

announce it because I knew that 
would lead to talking to people,” 
Sola said. “I just needed time to 
myself to realize that it really 

happened, especially because of 
the way it happened.”

When asked for a comment about 

Reggie’s passing, the University 
submitted a statement from Mary 
Jo Desprez, Director of Wolverine 
Wellness. 
Desprez 
wrote 
that 

Reggie has become a valuable part 
of the University community and 
recommends those who knew him 
take time to reflect on their good 
memories together in light of the 
recent loss.

“Reggie was one of a few pets 

that became part of our campus 
community,” Desprez wrote. “We 
are grateful for all the times that 
Reggie ‘showed up’ and made our 
community 
smile 
— 
especially 

during this past year. Reggie was a 
source of comfort and connection, 
of unconditional acceptance, of fun 
and joy.”

Reggie’s charismatic personality 

and uncanny ability to make people 
smile dates back to when Sola 
adopted 
the 
then-two-year-old 

corgi from a woman in Gaylord, 
MI. When Sola walked in the 
door, he said Reggie immediately 
beelined towards him, his tongue 
hanging out in greeting.

“He saw me and went racing all 

the way to the door and he had a 
big, happy look on his face,” Sola 
said. “All dogs are happy of course, 
but Reggie just seemed to be always 
happy.”

As an Air Force veteran who 

served during the Vietnam War, 
Sola 
originally 
adopted 
Reggie 

as a service dog, which allowed 
him to walk Reggie unleashed. 
As Reggie increasingly interacted 
with University students, Sola said 
he decided to have him trained as a 
therapy dog as well.

“Because of the type of service 

dog he was for me, he could legally 
be off a leash,” Sola said. “That 
was kind of magic because Reggie 
would just wander around and 
people could find him.”

LSA 
junior 
Abner 
Santiago 

vividly remembers meeting Reggie 
for the first time during a summer 
program prior to his freshman 
year. Santiago said he feels like 
it was yesterday that he was in 
the 7-Eleven on South University 
Avenue and began sprinting to the 
Diag after receiving a text message 
from a friend saying Reggie was 
there.

Campus community remembers 
beloved campus corgi Reggie Bee 
after owner announces his passing

After his first 100 days in office, 

President 
Biden 
gave 
his 
first 

address to a joint session of congress 
on Wednesday night. Biden talked 
about his administration’s COVID-19 
response and two major investment 
plans for American jobs and families. 
For the first time in American history, 
there were two women behind the 
President — Vice President Kamala 
Harris and Speaker of the House 
Nancy Pelosi.

Biden 
began 
his 
speech 
by 

reflecting on the worst pandemic 
the U.S. has seen in a century and 
the progress of the American Rescue 
Plan, which was signed into law on 
March 11. 

“After I promised we’d get 100 

million 
COVID-19 
vaccine 
shots 

into people’s arms in 100 days, we 
will have provided over 220 million 
COVID shots in those 100 days,” 
Biden said.

More than half of American adults 

have received at least one dose of 
the COVID-19 vaccine and 90% of 
Americans live within five miles of a 
vaccination location, Biden said. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Andrew 

Schaeffler, 
campus 
organizer 
for 

Students for Biden, said he was happy 
with Biden’s COVID-19 efforts. 

“There are always going to be 

some of those classic campaign 
promises, but in terms of COVID, 
he’s 
come 
through,” 
Schaeffler 

said. “The promises with the most 
tangible impact have been fulfilled 
and exceeded.”

Biden also discussed his American 

Jobs Plan to create millions of livable-
wage jobs, 75% of which he said 
would not require a college degree. 
The stated purpose of this legislation 
is to rebuild America’s infrastructure, 
including an upgrade to roads and 
bridges and replacing all lead pipes 
to ensure access to clean water. The 
legislation aims to support caregivers 
with better wages and benefits, 
positioning the U.S. to compete 
with foreign powers using a modern 
power grid and high-speed internet 
for every American, Biden said.

“This is the largest jobs plan since 

World War II,” Biden said. “American 
tax dollars are going to be used to 
buy American products, made in 
America, to create American jobs.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Evan 
Hall, 

Co-Chair 
of 
College 
Democrats, 

emphasized the impact of President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan.

“I believe the broader legislation 

on 
human 
infrastructure—which 

includes 
anti-racism 
policies 
and 

immigration—and climate change 
are eager measures we are excited to 
see impact Michigan politics,” Hall 
said.

Later 
in 
his 
speech, 
Biden 

highlighted the four goals of his 
administration’s American Families 
Plan, which will aim to cut child 
poverty rates in half, Biden said. The 
plan intends to increase access to 
education by providing two years of 
universal preschool and two years 
of free community college; access to 
quality, affordable childcare; up to 
twelve weeks of paid parental and 
medical leave; and an extension of 
the childcare tax credit.

 SOPHIA AFENDOULIS/Daily 

Reggie Bee, the University’s unofficial campus corgi passed away last December.


Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

announced 
her 
“MI 
Vacc 

to 
Normal 
Challenge” 
in 
a 

Thursday 
morning 
press 

conference, outlining a four-
step 
plan 
to 
gradually 
lift 

COVID-19 restrictions as state’ 
climbs from 48.8% vaccination 
of residents 16 and older to the 
goal of 70%. 

Currently, 
all 
Michigan 

residents above the age of 16 
are eligible to receive a vaccine. 
Two weeks after 55% of the 
eligible population has received 
at least one 
shot, Whitmer 

intends to lift the remote work 
rule, an executive order from 
Whitmer that any work that can 
be done remotely, must be done 
remotely. 

The next step comes two 

weeks after 60% of the eligible 
population, 
or 
4.9 
million 

Michigan residents, receives the 
vaccine. At this phase, Whitmer 
will increase capacity at indoor 
sports 
stadiums, 
conference 

halls, 
banquet 
centers 
and 

funeral homes to 25% and raise 
the allowed capacity for indoor 
exercise 
facilities 
and 
gyms 

from 30% to 50%. At this phase, 
Whitmer said she will also lift 
the curfew currently in place at 
restaurants and bars. 

Once 65% of the eligible 

population has received at least 
one shot, Whitmer intends to 
lift 
all 
restrictions 
limiting 

indoor capacity at restaurants 
and bars to 100 people and all 
other indoor facilities to 300 
people, while still enforcing 
social 
distancing 
guidelines 

between parties. The plan also 
states that guidelines relating 
to residential gatherings will be 
relaxed at this stage. 

Once 70% of those 16 or 

older 
— 
about 
5.9 
million 

Michiganders — have received 
a 
shot, 
Whitmer 
will 
lift 

all 
restrictions 
relating 
to 

gatherings and the Face Mask 
Order, with a possible exception 
if 
COVID-19 
numbers 
are 

increasing and threatening the 
medical system, or if a vaccine-

resistant variant emerges. This 
is the fourth and final step of 
Whitmer’s plan.

Whitmer 
said 
these 
steps 

are designed to keep Michigan 
residents 
safe 
as 
the 
state 

continues 
its 
economic 

recovery. 

“The 
MI 
Vacc 
to 
Normal 

Challenge 
outlines 
steps 

we can take to emerge from 
this pandemic as we hit our 
vaccination targets together,” 
Whitmer said. “If you haven’t 
already, I encourage you to rise 
to the challenge and be a part of 
the solution so we can continue 
our 
economic 
recovery 
and 

have the summer we all crave.” 

In her briefing, Whitmer also 

expressed her trust in vaccines. 
She said she believes it is in the 

state’s best interest for everyone 
to be vaccinated in order to 
return to normal.

“Vaccines are our best chance 

of putting this pandemic behind 
us and returning to normal,” 
Whitmer said. “They represent 
hope and healing. If you want 
to learn more, I encourage you 
to talk to your family doctor, 
learn about the safe, effective 
vaccines and how they can save 
your life and the lives of those 
you love.”

Whitmer said that goals at 

each step will make for the best 
transition, 
emphasizing 
the 

state’s need for teamwork. 

“If we work together, we can 

get this done,” Whitmer said. 
“We have to have a set of clear 
goals to accompany every step 
of this process. As we drive 
toward our eventual goal of 
returning to normal, we will 
pass checkpoints along the way 
that will allow us to gradually 
lift more limits and eventually, 
we’ll get over that finish line.”

together, we can 

get this done”

NEWS

On Saturday alone, more than 

400,000 
new 
COVID-19 
cases 

were recorded in one day in 
India. India’s healthcare system 
is experiencing severe shortages 
of hospital beds, oxygen and 
medication, leaving Indians to 
turn to social media to request 
simple supplies. 

Professor 
of 
biostatistics 

Bhramar Mukherjee has been 
actively involved with modeling 
COVID-19 metrics since March 
2020. Mukherjee predicted on 
February 27, 2021 that a second 
wave was coming in India and 
called for the public and policy 
makers to continue to adhere to 
COVID-19 guidelines. Critics say 
that India was unprepared for 
this 
second-wave 
referencing 

the lack of supplies and public 
compliance. 

Mukherjee is one of many 

in the University of Michigan 
community expressing support 
and concern for the deadly 
situation in India.

Rackham 
student 
Maxwell 

Salvatore was part of the team 
that built the COV-IND shiny app. 
The app uses publicly available 
data and other metrics to make 
prediction models.

Salvatore predicts the peak 

of the second wave will come in 
mid-May, at which point there will 
be 500,000 new cases each day. 

“We think that the actual 

number of cases might be 10 to 
14 times the reported numbers,” 
Salvatore said. “These numbers 
are people, and the pictures 
and videos that are coming out 
are devastating and calls for the 
coming together of the global 
community.”

On 
April 
27, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel released 
a statement expressing empathy 
and solidarity for those affected 
by the crisis. The statement 
encouraged community members 
to donate to the American India 
Foundation’s 
COVID 
response 

fund and listed other resources.

“India has long been one of 

our most cherished international 
partners 
in 
education 
and 

research. About 1,000 of our 
current 
students 
and 
6,000 

alumni hail from India,” Schlissel 
said. “The U.S. government has 

pledged to help, and we urge 
immediate 
and 
meaningful 

action. 
We 
are 
sharing 
our 

expertise with elected leaders to 
advise on how to best provide 
assistance.”

The U-M India Advisory Board, 

along with the U-M India Alumni 
Association, 
has 
led 
various 

initiatives to share medical and 
public health expertise with India.

Student 
groups 
across 

campus, including the South 
Asian American Health Initiative 
(SAAHI), South Asian Awareness 
Network (SAAN), Indian Student 
Association (ISA) and Project RISHI 
have collaborated to raise money 
for the Breathe India Fundraiser, 
which aims to provide oxygen 
concentrators 
to 
hospitals 
in 

Delhi, a COVID-19 hotspot. SAAHI 
has said they have raised $1,103 as 
of Sunday.

Public Health junior Nithya 

Arun, SAAHI executive director 
and Central Student Government 
President, started the initiative 
to alleviate the severe oxygen 
shortage in the country. Arun’s 
grandmother lives in New Delhi 
and has hypertension, which 
occasionally requires an oxygen 
tank. 

“(My grandmother) is doing 

fine, but there are so many 
people who do not have oxygen 
right now because of how badly 
this crisis was managed,” Arun 
said. “These incidents of COVID 
were 
preventable, 
(and) 
the 

Indian government could have 
taken action before it got this 
bad. Unfortunately, they put their 
own interests ahead of the well-
being of the people.”

LSA junior Mishaal Yazdani, 

incoming co-director for SAAN, 
said the virus has taken its toll on 
developing countries like India. 
Yazdani encouraged the United 
States to share its resources with 
other countries who need it.

“I’m from Pakistan, but we are 

all one community at the end of 
the day, one human population,” 
Yazdani 
said. 
“It’s 
really 

important that we are trying our 
best, donating and spreading 
awareness about this crisis.”

There 
has 
been 
growing 

concern over President Joe Biden’s 
plans to help vaccinate the rest of 
the world. Biden has pledged to 
send protective equipment and 
oxygen to India, in addition to 
providing the country with doses 

of the AstraZeneca vaccine once 
it is safe to do so.

Chair of Radiology Vikas Gulani 

is part of Health4theWorld, an 
organization 
founded 
by 
Dr. 

Bhavya Rehani that aims to 
provide basic healthcare services 
worldwide.

Gulani 
and 
a 
team 
of 

physicians across the U.S. and 
India collaborated on multiple 
projects to ease the burden on 
the healthcare system in India. 
One of their main efforts is to 
send oxygen concentrators to 
hospitals in India. Other projects 
aim to provide services such as 
palliative care, grief counseling 
and telemedicine. The team also 
sent healthcare kits with masks, 
vitamins, pharmaceuticals and 
pulse oximeters to Indians at 
home.

“The goal was to provide people 

with some way of taking care of 
themselves at home if they’re 
sick, so as to not overburden the 
hospitals,” Gulani said. “Every 
single bit of our work has been a 
labor of love and people donating 
their time.”

OPINION

I

’ll 
be 
honest, 
I’ve 
never 

understood the hype around 
space. 
While 
everyone 
in 

kindergarten ran around saying that 
they wanted to be the president or an 
astronaut, I sat quietly, ashamed that I 
aspired to be a teacher. Our dreams have 
inevitably changed since then, and as 
a third-year Business student, I — like 
many of my peers — don’t really know 
what I want to be. What I do know is 
that I still don’t want to be an astronaut; 
my sensitive stomach can barely handle 
a midnight Taco Bell run.

However, for those interested in 

space travel, the job market has never 
been better. We are amid a space 
travel renaissance, fueled by the rise of 
commercial players like SpaceX, Blue 
Origin and many small competitors 
with big ideas that receive NASA seed 
funding. And, with the Perseverance 
rover recently landing on Mars and 
NASA’s modern moon mission, Project 
Artemis, in the works, there are billions 
of dollars in government contracts 
available. This points to promising 
futures for aerospace engineers looking 
to make their marks at companies 
like Lockheed Martin or Boeing. The 

excitement has even spread to the 
military ranks, as repeated calls for “the 
next class of astronauts” have amplified. 

And you know that where there is 

excitement, there is money; and where 
there is money, there are Wall Street 
investors ready to lose it. Enter: Virgin 
Galactic.

In 2004, Virgin Galactic was founded as 

an extension of the Virgin Group, funded 
by British billionaire Richard Branson, with 
the mission of fulfilling the long-awaited 
fantasy of consumer space travel. They 
initially predicted that they would make 
history by 2009, taking customers on 
space flights. However, the company took 
until 2019 to actually make history, but it 
wasn’t by being successful in their mission. 
In fact, they were quite far from it, coming 
off of several failed space flights despite 
Branson’s repeated bullish predictions. 
Instead, they made their mark by 
becoming the first publicly traded space 
company through a merger with a special 
purpose acquisition company, usually 
referred to as a SPAC.
I

t’s after midnight and the 
textbooks haphazardly 
thrown around your desk 

are illuminated only by the 
computer screen you’ve been 
staring at all day. Empty Monster 
Energy drinks line the table beside 
you and you sigh: “Tomorrow, I’m 
getting ice cream. I deserve to treat 
myself.” 

This year, arguably more so than 

years past, the so-called “treat 
yourself culture” has expanded far 
beyond what was once a reward-
based mentality, where we used 
self-assurance to continue grinding 
through some sort of undesirable 
task. 
Now, 
the 
vernacular 
of 

“treating 
yourself” 
has 
become 

less about rewards and more 
about stress-induced indulgence. 
However, this growth mindset is a 
reflection of something deeper; it 
represents the more deep-seated 
issues with the stress we — students, 
adults and even children — regularly 
put ourselves under. Instead of 
feeling the need to constantly “treat 
ourselves,” perhaps we need to 
instead incorporate more into our 
daily lives that serves us.

This “treat yourself” culture is 

not something that has to be viewed 
as the antithesis of “hustle culture.” 
In fact, I think that is the root of 
the problem entirely. We have been 
bred to believe that if something 
is not amounting in trials and 
tribulations, 
then 
it 
isn’t 
hard 

enough work or we should be doing 
more. Especially at a top university 

like the University of Michigan, I 
constantly 
find 
myself 
wanting 

to do more. I want more credits, a 
higher grade point average and 
more responsibilities I’ll later use 
as conversation topics in interviews. 

This innate drive is by no means 

a bad thing. We all are trying to 
eventually land in a place where we 
can relax and live a more enjoyable 
life. However, there are a lot of 
problems with this logic. Without 
sounding completely hopeless and 
pessimistic, it is possible that the 
future we envision in our twenties 
will not come to fruition. Instead, it 
is important to incorporate things 
that make us happy within the ebb 
and flow of work, school or life-
induced stress. 

Psychology certainly supports 

this 
notion. 
Lauren 
Geall, 
a 

journalist for Stylist, discussed a 
new, related study in a recent article. 
Something that really resonated 
with me from the piece was this 
line: “The results (of the study) 
were clear – while having good self-
control was positively associated 
with happiness, being able to 
indulge in life’s little pleasures 
without 
berating 
ourselves 
for 

doing so is just as important.” 

This reminded me of the Marie 

Kondo ideology or the KonMari 
method, but applying it to far more 
than decluttering. Maybe in order 
to truly treat ourselves, we should 
be actively engaging in more things 
that spark joy. For example, even if 
you have a hectic schedule of work 

and school, make time to stop by 
your favorite coffee shop or allot ten 
minutes to go on a walk outdoors. 

This past year has proven an old 

saying to be scarily true. The saying 
goes: “live every day as your last, for 
you never know what tomorrow 
will bring.” Waking up to a world 
in lockdown is not something that 
any of us could have imagined. In 
a flash, the world was closed for 
business, everything kept at a six-
foot distance and away from arm’s 
reach. We all leaned on each other 
through technological and virtual 
means to keep afloat amid a time 
where isolation and fear reigned 
supreme. I was recently able to get 
fully vaccinated and the feeling 
I had was incomparable. It was 
almost as if every stress or bout of 
anxiety suffered throughout the 
past year had all combined and been 
washed away with the second shot 
in my arm. The world is far from 

To infinity and beyond: the false 
promise of space

back to normal, but the future is far 
brighter than it was not so long ago. 
This reflection has even further 
deepened 
my 
newly 
adopted 

philosophy of finding a middle 
ground between “hustle culture” 
and “treat yourself culture.” 

I cannot urge you, without 

being a hypocrite, to give up your 
late nights of studying, Monster 
Energy drinks and all (although, I 
actually prefer Bang Energy these 
days). I cannot, in good conscience, 
tell you to always choose to do 
something that makes you happy 
over something you have or should 
do. Frankly, this is just not the way 
life works. We have to endure the 
hard work and put in the time. If 

nothing else, it is a reminder that 
we are human. Like Lois Lowry’s 
“The Giver,” without pain, we’d also 
lose ecstasy and joy. It’s all about 
balance. And as the semester comes 
to a close and the Zoom meetings 
end, I encourage you to look back 
on what was arguably the weirdest 
year of our lives so far. 

Think about what made you 

stress. Think about what and who 
you leaned upon to alleviate some 
of that stress. As we enter normalcy 
step-by-step, I plan to try and find 
the gray area between hustle and 
indulgence for the year ahead. I will 
work hard and certainly have days 
that are nothing but stressful. 

However, instead of looking at 

everything I choose as a way to 
combat the stress as something 
to “treat myself,” I want to do 
things and choose things that 
provide me some form of happiness 
more 
regularly. 
Imagine 
how 

much happier we could be if the 
breakfast we ate with our morning 
coffee could be viewed as treating 
ourselves. 

In a very real way, this is 

genuinely 
true. 
Let’s 
find 
our 

middle ground and collaboratively 
try to make treating ourselves a 
far more common practice in the 
chaotic lives we lead.

P

resident 
Joe 
Biden 

recently 
reached 
the 

end of his first 100 days 

in office, the arbitrary measure 
American political media has 
decided is the opening period 
of a president’s term. Discus-
sion of these first 100 days has 
largely been related to Biden’s 
efforts in ending the COVID-19 
pandemic and re-energizing the 
country’s economy after over a 
year of lockdowns. This is par-
tially because, on most of the 
foreign policy issues the Ameri-
can media tends to care about, 
Biden has taken little action.

He has shown little inter-

est in finding a solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His 
policy on Iran up until now has 
mostly been fruitless negotia-
tions to revive the former nucle-
ar weapons deal. And while his 
ostensible end of support for 
the Saudi-led invasion of Yemen 

was initially met with some 
fanfare, it has largely been 
swept under the rug, especially 
after it was shown to be untrue. 
Seemingly the only exception 
to this has been Biden’s recent 
announcement that he plans 
to remove U.S. soldiers from 
Afghanistan after 20 years of 
war later this year. While I have 
frequently been critical of Biden 
in the past, I believe withdraw-
al from Afghanistan would be 
an unequivocally positive move 
from the president, and one he 
should absolutely proceed with.

However, it is important to 

consider that this alleged pull-
out of forces may not actually 
happen. 
Former 
Presidents 

Barack 
Obama 
and 
Donald 

Trump both announced troop 
withdrawals of their own, nei-
ther 
of 
which 
materialized. 

Additionally, as shown by his 
reversal on the end of U.S sup-

port for the Saudi invasion 
of Yemen, Biden is willing to 
announce the end of a U.S mili-
tary operation and then take it 
back. Most concerningly, the 
Biden administration has been 
uncomfortably 
vague 
about 

the more than 18,000 private 
military 
contractors 
currently 

stationed in Afghanistan, cur-
rently 
outnumbering 
official 

U.S military personnel by about 
seven to one. A pull-out that 
does not include PMCs would 
be effectively meaningless. 

Nevertheless, 
even 
the 

prospect of ending the war 
in 
Afghanistan 
has 
terrified 

many in the media and a num-
ber of Biden’s fellow politicians. 
These objections have primar-
ily fallen under two categories: 
that withdrawal will be a boon 
for terrorist activity, and that it 
will cause an erosion of human 
rights — women’s rights in par-

ticular. The first category is 
best exemplified by Sen. Lind-
sey Graham, R-S.C., who stated 
shortly after Biden’s announce-
ment that withdrawal means 
canceling “an insurance policy 
against another 9/11.” Among 
voices for the second position is 
Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan politi-
cian and peace negotiator, who 
claims “withdrawal of U.S. forc-
es from Afghanistan will under-
mine the Afghan government’s 
ongoing negotiations with the 
Taliban” and “risks sidelining 
Afghan women and all of the 
gains we have made over the 
years.”

However, neither of these 

arguments holds water when 
examined closer. As for the idea 
that U.S troop presence is pre-
venting another terrorist attack 
on American soil: While with-
drawal might strengthen the 
presence of terrorist groups like 

al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, this 
would not make it more likely 
for them to launch a 9/11-style 
attack on America again. Al-
Qaeda still maintains a presence 
in countries such as Syria and 
Yemen that they could use to 
plan terrorist activity. Even if we 
were able to wipe out all of their 
bases of operation, attacks like 
9/11 require mostly manpower 
and small arms, neither of which 
require having a large presence 
in any country. Keeping troops 
in Afghanistan does nothing to 
stop another large-scale terror-
ist attack — especially consider-
ing the Taliban, who would be 
the most likely to aid al-Qaeda in 

A

cademia can teach us a lot. 
But does it always teach 
the most important things? 

Through complex systems like math 
and languages, we are taught, albeit 
in a structured and linear way, how 
to solve problems and communicate 
in the world. And yet, with all of the 
questions we answer in academia, 
there is one that is rarely, if ever, 
posed: Whose problems are we solv-
ing? 

When we are young, we are often 

reminded of how powerful it is to 
have dreams for the future. But little 
by little, from K-12 to university, that 
sense of imagination often becomes 
lost. If we aren’t careful we eventu-
ally become little more than pawns in 
someone else’s game.

Not that leadership roles aren’t 

valuable, but at what point does being 
a founder of a company justify mak-
ing two thousandfold more than your 
employees? If we crunched the num-
bers, I think it’s doubtful that the 50k 
salary of an entry-level tech employ-
ee would scale against a CEO’s $108.9 
million-dollar per year income. No 
matter how much risk is involved in 
being a founder, in a single lifetime, 
no human being’s time and energy 

are worth two thousand times more 
than another’s.

CEOs who pay themselves dis-

proportionately 
more 
than 
their 

employees do not provide exponen-
tially more value to their companies. 
Rather, the power they’ve garnered is 
assumed to be insurmountably more. 
And while, without a doubt, econom-
ic inequality goes much deeper than 
the salaries of entry-level employees 
and CEOs in a given industry, the 
pattern of exploitation is always the 
same: the rich and powerful exploit 
others to fill their pockets, capitaliz-
ing on the fact that the lower classes 
rely on them to survive. 

To end exploitation in large indus-

tries, CEOs need to own up to the fact 
that their pay system needs major 
restructuring. But at its core, creating 
that change within our society comes 
down to reframing the way we value 
each other as human beings.

Few events are as exciting or 

significant to a film writer as the 
Oscars. Normally, the event offers the 
chance to meet with talented actors 
and filmmakers during a celebration 
of some of the year’s biggest films. 
Yet in a year filled with delays and 
accommodations, it’s no surprise 
that things didn’t quite look the 
same at this year’s Academy Awards. 
The typical January date, along 
with the usual timeline for eligible 
films, was postponed by three 
months. The setting was, for lack 
of a better word, intimate: Rather 
than inviting all of Hollywood’s 
elite, the ceremony was made up of 
nominees, presenters and plus-ones 
only, held in Los Angeles’s Union 
Station with nominees clustered 
around small tables, as well as 
satellite locations around the world. 
The event was regulated by COVID-
19 protocols determined by a team 
of epidemiologists (most of whom 
Oscars producer Steven Soderbergh 
had met during the creation of his 
film “Contagion”). And, unlike in 
normal years, press were not allowed 

into the in-person backstage area, 
but instead brought into a Zoom 
meeting — Michigan Daily writers 
newly amongst them.

Despite 
Zoom 
snafus 
and 

awkward silences, being at this 
year’s Academy Awards was an 
incredible chance to view the inner 
workings of the Academy and the 
press — an experience that we 
truly appreciated and enjoyed. For 
one thing, watching a live feed of 
the event without being subjected 
to ads was nice; for another, it was 
an honor to be present for some of 
the inspiring words from winners 
that only the press got to hear 
and cherish. So even as we were 
frantically switching between the 
ceremony 
and 
the 
“backstage” 

interviews — truly, catching the 
tail end of Glenn Close shaking her 
booty while switching back from an 
interview about production design 
was unexpected — it was certainly 
an experience to remember. Here 
are some of our favorite moments 
from the night. For a full list of

The Academy awarded two Jean 

Hersholt Humanitarian Awards this 
year, with one going to the Motion 

Picture and Television Fund and 
another to Hollywood superstar 
Tyler Perry. MPTF and Perry join 
the likes of Frank Sinatra, Audrey 
Hepburn and Oprah Winfrey as the 
40th and 41st winners of the award, 
which is named for a Danish-born 
actor, philanthropist and one-time 
MPTF president. MPTF, a mutual aid 
organization for the entertainment 
industry, is celebrating its 100th 
year in 2021. MPTF also operates a 
number of health and senior centers 
in Los Angeles exclusively for those 
in the industry. The award was 
accepted by Bob Beitcher, current 
president and CEO of MPTF, who said 
in his remarks, “We really and truly 
take care of our own.” 

Tyler Perry, the producer, director 

and star of the “Madea” films, was 
awarded 
for 
his 
philanthropic 

work, 
which 
includes 
picking 

up seniors’ grocery bills, paying 
Rayshard Brooks’ funeral expenses 
and opening Camp Quarantine to 
keep Tyler Perry Studios employees 
working during the pandemic. Perry 
gave a moving acceptance speech, 
encouraging his audience to “refuse 
hate.” He said that he is dedicating 
the award to those who “stand in 
the middle,” adding, “that’s where 
healing 
happens. 
That’s 
where 

conversation happens. That’s where 
change happens.”

Nomadland

Nomadland 
was 
the 
most 

awarded film at this year’s Oscars, 
winning in three of its six nominated 

categories, including Best Picture. 
Critics and bettors were fairly certain 
that Nomadland would win, and 
The Daily predicted it too. There’s 
something about that sweeping 
yet subtle narrative and grand 
imagery of the American landscape 
that was sure to win the hearts 
of the Academy’s voters. Frances 
McDormand produced and starred 
in Nomadland, so she took the stage 
twice, also winning for Best Actress 
in a Leading Role. 

At the end of the group Best Picture 

acceptance speech, McDormand 
paid tribute by howling at the moon 
to Nomadland production sound 
mixer Michael Wolf Snyder, who 
recently died at age 35. Chloé Zhao 
won the Oscar for Best Directing as 

the second woman and first woman 
of color recognized with this award. 
In her remarks, she dedicated the 
win to “anyone who had the faith 
and the courage to hold on to the 
goodness in themselves, and to hold 
on to the goodness in each other, no 
matter how difficult it is to do that.” 
Speaking to the press backstage, 
Zhao’s message was clear: “It’s pretty 
fabulous to be a woman in 2021.”

I sit in my pajamas across from my 

laptop. On the screen sits another man 
alone in his bedroom, strumming a 
guitar. At the whim of my residence 
hall’s intermittent Wi-Fi connection, 
my 
stream 
looks 
more 
like 
a 

PowerPoint presentation than a video, 
and my laptop’s dingy speakers make 
the audio sound more like a phone call 
than a concert. When I ordered tickets 
to SpringFest, I didn’t receive a sheet 
of paper with a barcode, but rather a 
digital link. My fellow concertgoers 
aren’t cheering and dancing around 
me. My only knowledge of their 
presence is through tiny avatars in 
a comment section. This is what it’s 
like to attend a music festival during 
a pandemic. It is our best attempt to 
make a typically in-person experience 
virtual.

Every year, hundreds of students 

flock to the Diag to participate in 
SpringFest, a charity music festival run 
by MUSIC Matters, a U-M non-profit 
focused on creating local change 

through music. The day is filled with 
performances by local artists, various 
activities put on by clubs and massive 
fundraising projects. The headlining 
act — which has previously been 
artists like J. Cole, Migos and A$AP Ferg 
— takes the stage last to end the night. 
All the proceeds from the festival go 
to benefit many of MUSIC Matter’s 
charitable programs like the Michigan 
Overnight Experience program and 
the Big Thinkers Scholarship.

This year especially, the cliché 

rings true: The show must go on, and 
SpringFest is no exception. This year’s 
SpringFest was presented virtually 
over HeySummit + Remo. Although 
virtual, the day was still filled with the 
usual giveaways, performances and 
presentations. At night, the festival was 
sent off by the band Hippo Campus, a 
Minnesota-based indie rock band.

I was initially concerned about 

attending a digital music festival. 
Being unfamiliar with the platform, 
I 
encountered 
many 
technical 

difficulties in my initial attempts. 
However, once I was watching my 
first musical performance, all my 
anxieties were quickly washed away 

with a charismatic performance by 
Oren Levin. It was at that moment I 
discovered the greatest advantage 
of hosting a digital concert — the 
intimacy. In between songs, Levin, who 
performed from his bedroom, talked 
about his hopes for future musical 

ventures. He mused at length about 
his switch to online performances 
to replace live concerts. He even 
interacted with fellow concertgoers 
who exuded overwhelming positivity 
in the comments section. By being 

completely separate from the artist 
physically, I received an incredibly 
candid performance that would not 
have been possible on stage.

This experience continued with 

Steve Banks, the schoolteacher and 
Detroit-based rapper also known as 

This Life. We Lead. Fresh home from 
work, Banks’s performance felt like a 
friend eagerly showing you his new 
beats. He skipped around folders on 
his computer, his eyes lighting up 
whenever he saw a beat he wanted to 

rap over. It was refreshing to watch a 
performer who seemed to genuinely 
have fun in a less formal setting.

The festival closed off the night 

with Hippo Campus. I fell in love with 
the band after discovering “Bambi” 
while deep in a YouTube rabbit hole 
earlier this year. Knowing the band 
was famous for their stage presence, 
I was excited to see them live. Hippo 
Campus’s performance was simply 
a pleasure to watch, and their 
sound brought immeasurable joy 
to my lifeless dorm room. Although 
completely alone, I couldn’t help from 
bobbing my head to “Buttercup” or 
humming along to “Way It Goes.” I was 
especially impressed with the band 
members’ sense of humor during 
the live performance. In between 
songs, members held a groove 
while bandmates quipped on facts 
from the University of Michigan’s 
Wikipedia page. While a lesser artist 
may have made the virtual format 
dull or impersonal, Hippo Campus’s 
performance was just plain fun.

Super strength. Lightning speed. 

Telepathy. These are just a few of the 
superpowers the heroes of Netflix’s 
new series “Jupiter’s Legacy” unleash 
on their enemies. But after a century 
of putting criminals behind bars, 
these superheroes’ efforts to restore 
justice 
have 
become 
increasingly 

controversial. 

The series is based on Mark 

Millar’s comic of the same name. 
The Millarworld production focuses 
on the lives of those working for the 
Union, a group of superheroes who 
achieved their powers during the Great 
Depression of the 1930s. Ever since, 
they have been led by The Utopian 
(Josh 
Duhamel, 
“Safe 
Haven”), 

husband to Lady Liberty (Leslie Bibb, 
“The Lost Husband”) and father of 
two 
young 
heroes. 
Unfortunately, 

the standards he sets for his children 
are practically impossible to reach, 
creating a complicated and toxic family 
dynamic.

Times have changed, though, and 

the corruption of the 21st century far 

surpasses that of previous decades. 
As society changes, the original code 
set by The Utopian — to never kill — 
is being called into question by both 
civilians and Union members alike. 
With a new generation of heroes and 
a different set of problems, the values 
once upheld are becoming outdated. 
And so, even when the superhero suits 
come off and the crime-fighting ceases 
for the day, the drama continues.

At 
a 
recent 
roundtable 
with 

members of the cast, Andrew Horton, 
who plays The Utopian’s son, Brandon 
Sampson, noted that the show differs 
from other superhero stories. He 

stated that, unlike Marvel and DC 
productions, “Jupiter’s Legacy” is more 
of a “human story … it’s almost more 
of a drama than a superhero, action-
packed show.” This is because the 
plot doesn’t just consist of repetitive 
fight scenes between good guys and 
bad guys. Rather, it focuses on the 
underlying character relationships: a 
mother and daughter; a father and son; 
a sister and brother. In fact, it’s with 
the exploration of these dynamics that 
Millar’s comic series combats this idea 
of good versus evil altogether.

Matt Lanter (“90210”), who plays 

villain George Hutch, discussed this 
aspect of the show. Specifically, he 
spoke about the misconception that the 
world is either black or white, moral or 
immoral, which occurs throughout the 
show and creates many rifts amongst 
the characters. Yet, as Lanter stated 
and the show aims to prove, “there’re 
shades of grey everywhere,” and that 
underneath the masks and without the 
capes, these superheroes are humans 
living in an imperfect world. 

“Jupiter’s Legacy” is not like the 

average Superman or Batman movie. 
This doesn’t mean it lacks the action and 
entertainment these other productions 

provide audiences with; there is just 
a greater reflection on real-life issues. 
Horton spoke about how this factor of 
the show made it that much easier for 
him to relate to a character that he is, in 
actuality, very different from. He stated 
that he “couldn’t necessarily connect 
with super speed, super strength, and 
the ability to fly, but coming back to 
the human characteristics is what 
makes the show so interesting … so 
much more than your run-of-the-mill 
superhero show.” This sentiment was 
echoed by other members of the cast.

One paragraph into P. Djèlí 

Clark’s “A Master of Djinn,” 
the 
chronically 
truant 
self-

preservation muscle in my brain 
jerked to life and hit pause. The 
novel is too well crafted, too 
interesting, too readable. It’s a 
magical detective story set in 
pre-World War I Cairo narrated 
by no-nonsense special agent 
Fatma 
el-Sha’arawi 
and 
her 

plucky, 
paperwork-loving, 

hijab-wearing 
junior, 
Hadia 

Abdel Hafez. It is set in the 
same world as other books 
from the same author but is 
a 
stand-alone 
story. 
From 

its 
base 
components 
alone, 

mathematically 
speaking, 

“A Master of Djinn” almost 
overwhelmed me (and my exam 
study schedule).

Once started, “A Master of 

Djinn” is a fast read. Clark 
creates a compelling fantasy 
setting full of representation. 
Despite 
being 
marketed 
as 

steampunk, 
the 
novel 
is 
a 

detective, police procedural at 
its core. When twenty members 
of a secret society are brutally 
murdered, special agent Fatma 
and her new partner Hadia are 
tasked with locating the killer. 
Together, they unravel a larger 
magical 
plot 
within 
their 

Egyptian home city. 

Set before WWI, the novel 

imagines 
a 
world 
before 

American 
hegemony 
and 

nuclear 
power. 
In 
Fatma’s 

metropolitan Cairo, the local 
zeitgeist is one of possibility, 
with 
energy 
wild 
and 

unpredictable. The world is less 
surveilled, less formed at the 
turn of the century. But Clark 
does not settle for easy first 
impressions of a halcyon past. 
Considering the many social 
identities 
of 
the 
characters, 

the novel would be incomplete 
without 
a 
consideration 

of 
power 
structures 
and 

imperialism. 
Clark 
mindfully 

engages with the past, forcing 
his characters to move through 
a world recognizable in its 
colonialism, 
colorism 
and 

religion. Fatma’s friend Benny, 
a 
Jim 
Crow-era 
American 

ex-pat, 
helps 
contextualize 

and ground Clark’s expansive 

world. 
Perhaps, 
instead 
of 

the 
Djinns 
and 
Priestesses, 

the 
most 
fantastical 
aspect 

of Clark’s novel is its ability 
to recall a tantalizingly vast, 
flawed and cautiously hopeful 
world.

“A Master of Djinn” is an 

amazingly 
consistent 
read. 

Clark is a competent storyteller 
and a master of unobtrusive 
style. 
While 
the 
ultimate 

mystery is not hard to puzzle 
out 
three-quarters 
in, 
the 

characters are vibrant and the 
plot is sound. Some writers have 
stylistic ticks that require more 
deliberate 
reading; 
fantasy 

writers, in particular, have an 
unfortunate tendency to “info-
dump,” 
front-loading 
their 

worldbuilding and characters. 
Most fantasy classics require 
some measure of indelicate, 
brute mental force to break into 
the center of the novel. Clark 
breaks that mold, presenting 
a digestible and compelling 
fantasy landscape. His writing 
exemplifies how such a novel 
should be paced, most notably 
in 
how 
he 
distributes 
and 

buffers 
the 
customary 
info-

dump hurdles. 

Clark introduces the main 

character, 
Fatma, 
over 
the 

course 
of 
one 
chapter. 
It’s 

with a deft, careful hand that 
Clark contours and colors this 
LGBTQ+, 
suit-wearing, 
cane-

sword-wielding, 
overworked 

government 
agent. 
Clark 

approaches 
each 
character 

with 
care, 
depicting 
them 

as 
dynamic, 
multifaceted 

characters that are informed, 

rather than defined by their 
social 
identities. 
They 
feel 

authentic. Clark is cheeky with 
his characters. Fatma’s junior 
agent endearingly sports a fun, 
modern bright blue headscarf 
as a display of her progressive 
values.

Because the novel follows 

the 
detective-novel, 
CSI-

esque 
structure, 
one 
might 

misread it as an entertaining 
but 
run-of-the-mill 
iteration 

— not quite radical but also 
not 
derivative. 
However, 

Clark’s 
characterizations 
and 

attention to detail positions “A 
Master of Djinn” solidly above 
its contemporaries. The only 
downfall of his attention to 
character and storytelling is 
how unsustainable producing 
ten more similar novels would 
be. Ideally, there would be 
as many “A Master of Djinn” 
entries as there are “Dresden 
Files” novels. Alas, the rich 
world 
and 
characters 
leave 

room only for a sequel or so. 

Clark’s 
novel 
is 
a 
prime 

fantasy book complete with 
a 
unique 
comprehension 
of 

identity 
and 
personhood. 

While reading “A Master of 
Djinn,” 
time 
flows 
eagerly 

past, 
weaving 
through 

bustling, 
magical 
Cairo 

streets. The novel’s concept is 
uncomplicated 
and 
naturally 

integrates 
Arabic 
mythology 

with 
historical, 
fantasy 

settings. 
Clark’s 
dynamic 

characters 
and 
consideration 

of historical power imbalances, 
class and racism are a balm to 
the tired fantasy reader.

The No. 19 Michigan softball 

team did its job.

The Wolverines won all four 

games 
in 
the 
weekend 
slate 

against Penn State (5-26 Big Ten), 
improving to 28-5 on the season. In 
total, they outscored the Nittany 
Lions 34-6, including two run-rule 
victories on Saturday that ended 
10-0 and 12-2, respectively. The 
closest game came on Sunday with 
a 5-3 win that Michigan was in 
control of from beginning to end. 

Penn State, the bottomfeeders of 

the Big Ten, opened its season with 
15 straight losses and has only won 
a total of five games, three of which 
came against second-to-last place 
Rutgers.

So the Wolverines, who sit atop 

the conference, did exactly what 
they were expected to do: thrash 
them. 

It began in the first game. 

Michigan broke the seal in the 

third inning, scoring three runs in 
the frame: two off a double from 
senior first baseman Lou Allan and 
another off a double from senior 
third Baseman Taylor Bump.

The Wolverines struck again in 

the seventh, the first run coming 
on an error by Penn State left 
fielder 
Lilia 
Crouthamel. 
Allan 

and Bump each knocked another 

run in, followed by sophomore 
utility player Audrey LeClair, who 
knocked a single into centerfield to 
bring Bump home and stretch the 
lead to 7-0.

In the bottom of the seventh, 

the Nittany Lions managed one 
run but came nowhere close to 
engineering a comeback, and the 
game would end at 7-1.

“We 
wanted 
to 
come 
out 

swinging, come out scoring runs 
first, and that’s exactly what we 
did,” junior outfielder Lexie Blair 
said. “I think we did a great job.”

The next day, Michigan pressed 

its foot down on the gas even 
harder. 

In 
the 
first 
game 
of 
the 

doubleheader, the Wolverines put 
up 10 runs in a collective effort 
that included a homerun by Bump, 
a single by junior catcher Hannah 
Carson that scored two, a two-RBI 
double from Allan and a single 
from sophomore Jessica Garmen 
on a pinch hit in her first collegiate 
at-bat.

In the second bout of the day, 

Michigan wasted no time, putting 
up four runs in the first inning 
off of a two-RBI Allan double and 
a two-run homerun from Bump. 
In the sixth, sophomore infielder 
Julia Jimenez banged a triple 
down the line, scoring two. After 
another run scored, Blair stepped 
up to the plate with two out and 

two on. Blair proceeded to send the 
ball over the fence on a three-run 
homer, putting the Wolverines up 
12-2 and tallying Michigan’s sixth 
run of the inning.

It was the fourth RBI of the game 

for Blair, one of the Wolverines’ 
strong 
performers 
alongside 

Allan, Bump, Jimenez and senior 
infielder Natalia Rodriguez, who 
went 3-of-4 with two runs. 

After both of Saturday’s games 

ended 
in 
run-rule 
victories, 

Sunday’s matchup was a change of 
pace. Michigan came out on top, 
but by a much smaller 5-3 margin. 
The Wolverines’ runs came early, 
all five in the first three innings. 
The Nittany Lions came on later, in 
a comeback effort that amounted 
to three runs. It was shut down 
in the bottom of the seventh on 
three straight strikeouts, sending 
Michigan back to Ann Arbor with 
the sweep.

Eight Wolverines selected in 2021 NFL Draft

The 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 

recent NFL Draft success continued 
this week, as eight Wolverines heard 
their name called in Cleveland 
between Thursday and Saturday. 
Only four schools — Alabama, Ohio 
State, Georgia and Notre Dame 
— saw more players drafted than 
Michigan.

The Wolverines’ 11 draft-eligible 

players didn’t have to wait long 
to hear one of their names called. 
The 
Indianapolis 
Colts 
selected 

defensive end Kwity Paye with the 
No. 21 overall pick, making him 
Michigan’s 
sixth 
first-round 
pick 

since 2017. He’s also the Wolverines’ 
third first-round EDGE in that span, 
joining Taco Charlton and Rashan 
Gary.

A trio of Michigan players came 

off the board in the third round, with 
offensive lineman Jalen Mayfield 
heading to the Atlanta Falcons at 
pick No. 68, wide receiver Nico 
Collins going to the Houston Texans 
at pick No. 89 and cornerback Ambry 
Thomas heading to the San Francisco 
49ers at pick No. 102. Collins and 
Thomas opted out of the 2020 season 
amid 
COVID-19 
concerns, 
while 

Mayfield only played sparingly due 
to injury.

Linebacker Cam McGrone and 

fullback Ben Mason were each 
selected in the same eight-pick span 
during the fifth round — the former 
by the New England Patriots and 
the latter by the Baltimore Ravens. 
McGrone, the No. 177 pick, becomes 
the fourth Wolverine drafted by the 
Patriots since 2019. The previous 
three — Josh Uche, Chase Winovich 
and Michael Onwenu — have all 
made an impact early in their careers 
in Foxborough. Mason, meanwhile, 
will get a chance to impress Ravens 
coach John Harbaugh in the ways 
he dazzled Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. The former team captain 
saw reps at full back and defensive 
line and emerged as a senior captain 
in Ann Arbor. He was announced as a 
tight end, though he projects to be at 
his best in short-yardage situations.

Drafted 
No. 
202 
overall 
by 

the 
Cincinnati 
Bengals, 
running 

back Chris Evans is set to join a 
dynamic young offense. He became 
the program’s first running back 
drafted since Michigan’s all-time 
leading rusher, Mike Hart, in 2008. 
After a productive beginning to his 
career, Evans served a one-year 
suspension during the 2019 season 
prior to rejoining the team in 2020. 
He worked primarily as a pass-
catching option out of the backfield 
— a role that should carry over well 

to Cincinnati.

The Wolverines’ final draft pick 

came in the sixth round, when the 
Washington Football Team selected 
long snapper Camaron Cheeseman 
at pick No. 225. It’s uncommon 
to see a specialist drafted, but 
Cheeseman entered the weekend as 
the consensus No. 1 long snapper in 
the 2021 class.

Following the draft, defensive 

tackle Carlo Kemp and tight end 
Nick Eubanks each inked free agent 
deals. Kemp became a Green Bay 
Packer, while Eubanks joined former 
Michigan teammate Sean McKeon 
in the Dallas Cowboys tight ends 
room. Kicker Quinn Nordin remains 
unsigned as of Sunday evening, 
but it would be unsurprising if that 
changed in the near future.

Despite last year’s 2-4 record, the 

Wolverines’ eight draft selections 
is a strong indication of the talent 
Harbaugh’s 
program 
continues 

to produce. Collins, Thomas and 
Cheeseman opted out of the 2020 
season, while Paye, McGrone and 
Mayfield were hampered by injuries. 
With 18 players selected in the last 
two 
NFL 
Drafts, 
Michigan 
will 

look to reload before taking the field 
again this fall.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com SPORTS

When college hockey resumes in 

the fall, Michigan will have a new 
starting goaltender.

Strauss Mann — who spent his 

sophomore and junior years as the 
starter in goal for the Wolverines — 
will not return for his senior season, 
instead opting to pursue a professional 
career, according to an announcement 
on Twitter. 

“I’m looking forward to my next 

chapter as I pursue a professional 
hockey career,” Mann’s statement 
read. “As I solidify my plans, I feel both 
excited for the future and immensely 
appreciative 
for 
everything 
the 

University of Michigan has given me.”

In 
his 
three 
seasons 
with 

Michigan, Mann was a solid and 
consistent presence in net, posting 
a career save percentage of .926 and 
tallying 11 shutouts in 77 games. His 
sophomore year, Mann earned Big 
Ten Goaltender of the Year honors, 
while also finishing as a finalist for 
the Mike Richter Award in both his 
seasons as the Wolverines’ starter. 
Last season, he was also Michigan’s 
first goalie to be named captain in 78 
years. 

At 22 years old, Mann is ineligible 

for the 2021 NHL Draft. Still, he 
should have plenty of suitors as an 
undrafted free agent. In March, The 
Athletic’s 
Corey 
Pronman 
ranked 

Mann as the No. 3 free agent from the 
NCAA or Europe and the top goalie on 
the list. 

Having an NHL career after going 

undrafted isn’t uncommon — Luke 
Glendening, 
for 
example, 
played 

briefly in the minors after graduating 
from Michigan, and has since played 
eight NHL seasons with the Detroit 
Red Wings. 

The biggest obstacle for Mann 

moving forward will be his height. 
Standing at just six feet, Mann would 
be undersized as a modern NHL 
goaltender. In 2020, for example, 
only one NHL goalie, Pittsburgh’s 
Casey DeSmith, stood at the same 
height as Mann. Of course, size isn’t 
a dealbreaker — Henrik Ludqvist and 
Jonathan Quick are both only an inch 
taller than Mann — but if it sows doubt 
in the minds of NHL scouts, it will 
make Mann’s transition to the pros 
that much more difficult. 

Still, Mann’s height clearly was 

never a problem for the Wolverines, 
and that’s part of the reason why 
they’ll miss him so much. Erik 
Portillo, who started five games for 
Michigan as a freshman and recorded 

a solid .935 save percentage, will 
likely take on the permanent starting 
role, but it’s unclear who will fill 
in as the Wolverines’ backup next 

season. Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
will need to pick up either a late 
commitment or a transfer in the next 
few months. 

At the end of the day, though, it will 

be hard for anyone to replicate what 
Mann did as Michigan’s goalie. 

Michigan pulls off historic win over archrival Ohio State

For the first time in Michigan 

men’s lacrosse program history, 
the Wolverines advanced to the 
Big Ten tournament semifinals 
with a win against Ohio State. 
It was also their first win over 
their rivals in three tries this 
season.

Michigan (3-8 Big Ten) pulled 

off a historic victory for the 
program against their biggest 
rival, Ohio State (4-7), with a 
15-11 win in Columbus. 

Heading 
into 
Saturday’s 

matchup, the team had nothing 
to lose against the Buckeyes.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

struggled mightily this season 
with maintaining leads. Both of 
Michigan’s previous two losses, 
to Penn State and No. 8 Rutgers, 
were a result of the team failing 
to hold onto a lead. Both games 
culminated in one-goal losses 
for the Wolverines. 

In order to beat Ohio State, 

Michigan needed all hands on 

deck and had to make minimal 
mistakes. 

The first quarter saw the 

Wolverines start off fast with a 
3-0 lead. Strong defensive clears 
and successful rides allowed the 
defense to be involved in the 
offensive attack — the first three 
goals all came from defensemen. 

“They 
ran 
their 
routes,” 

Michigan 
coach 
Kevin 
Conry 

said. “I think over the last 
couple of games we left a couple 
of things on the table by not 
completing 
our 
routes 
and 

finishing our runs, so it is good 
to see our guys be aggressive in 
transition, finish their routes 
and then get rewarded with 
those opportunities.” 

Ohio State would respond 

with three goals of their own 
in the span of a little under 
three minutes to tie the game. 
It seemed as though Michigan 
would continue its trend of 
dropping 
leads 
and 
turning 

games into close losses, but that 
image quickly disappeared.

A combination of strong zone 

defensive plays and offensive 
opportunities 
in 
the 
second 

quarter allowed the Wolverines 
to take a 7-4 lead at halftime — 

led by a three goal effort in the 
second quarter from freshman 
attackman Michael Boehm. 

Michigan was able to keep the 

ball out of the hands of the Ohio 
State offense, with aggressive 

defense forcing seven turnovers 
in 
the 
second 
quarter. 
The 

Wolverines had nine shots on 
goal compared to the Buckeyes’ 

three. Michigan’s ride allowed 
their offense to capitalize on 
turnovers, which in turn led to 
easy goals. 

“I thought our ride was our 

biggest 
boost.” 
Conry 
said. 

“(Junior attackman) Bryce Clay 
made some big plays in the ride, 
which allowed us to get extra 
possessions and score a couple 
cheapies.” 

The second half of the game 

was 
much 
more 
contested, 

as 
Ohio 
State 
managed 
to 

capitalize on faceoffs in the 
third 
quarter. 
The 
Buckeyes 

mustered four goals in the third 
quarter, cutting the lead to 10-8 
heading into the fourth.

Momentum appeared to be 

swinging towards Ohio State, 
until a timeout by Michigan 
late 
in 
the 
third 
quarter. 

Reinvigorated, the Wolverines 
started 
the 
fourth 
quarter 

with a 3-0 scoring run led by 
sophomore 
attackman 
Josh 

Zawada. The Buckeyes would 
manage to score three of their 
own, but it wasn’t enough — 
a strong performance in net 
by 
junior 
goaltender 
John 

Kiracoffe in the fourth sealed 
the deal.

Thirty-four.
That’s how many runs the Michigan 

softball team scored in its four-game 
sweep of Penn State this weekend.

Twenty-three.
The Wolverines’ previous best total 

for runs in a series, recorded a little less 

than a month ago against Ohio State.

The 
offensive 
explosion 
for 

Michigan was the catalyst to the four 
wins it enjoyed this weekend and is 
indicative of the team’s trend over the 
past month.

In the first game in Saturday’s 

double-header, Michigan came one 
run short of their best single-game 
run total of 11 in a 10-0 victory. They 

followed that game up with their best 
output of the season in a 12-2 victory. 
Both games ended in a six-inning 
mercy rule.

It wasn’t just one or two players 

providing 
the 
offense 
for 
the 

Wolverines — they got production out 
of almost everybody on the weekend. 
12 different Michigan players got 
hits throughout the four-game set, 

and 11 drove home at least one run. 
Sophomore utility player Audrey Leclair 
recorded her first collegiate hit and RBI, 
showcasing the offensive depth that 
was on display all weekend.

Despite the team’s overall offensive 

success, some players stood above the 
rest.

Senior first baseman Lou Allan was 

the driving force behind the Wolverine 
offense and was a constant presence in 
the box score. Allan tallied two hits in 
all four games, drove home nine runs 
and hit her eighth home run of the year, 
tying for the team lead with senior third 
baseman Taylor Bump.

Bump also continued her upward-

trending offensive production over 
the weekend. She tallied seven hits, six 
runs, six RBI and two home runs in the 
four-game set.

“I think that’s what your hope is 

as a staff and as a program, that your 
seniors play their best ball in their final 
year. And, that’s exactly what we’re 
seeing right now,” Michigan assistant 
coach Bonnie Tholl said last week. “ I 
think that … Taylor Bump and Lou Allan 
have never been more productive in a 
Michigan uniform than they have been 
over the past month, and I’m super 
excited for them. Because this is what 
everyone hopes their senior year is like.”

It wasn’t just the seniors showing out 

either. Sophomore second baseman 
Julia Jimenez and junior outfielder 
Lexie Blair had strong individual 
showings of their own. 

Jimenez secured a hit in all four 

games — multiple hits in three of the 
four — drove in three runs and scored 
two runs herself. After only managing 
one hit last weekend, Jimenez bounced 
back with her strongest weekend of 
the year. 

Blair simply continued producing as 

she has done all year. The Wolverines’ 
leader in batting average got four hits 
and RBI, while also scoring six runs for 
her team. 

“We all just have one common goal,” 

Blair said. “Just to be on time, play with 
one heartbeat, and just focus on having 
quality at bats, you can, if you’re fouling 
off 8, 10, 12 pitches and you end up 
striking out we still consider that quality 
at bat because you made the pitcher 
work, you’re seeing the ball.”

The 
ease 
at 
which 
Michigan 

produced runs all weekend hasn’t been 
there all season. 

At the beginning of the year when 

the Wolverines played their games 
in Florida, they frequently struggled 
to find consistent offense. To win 
games, Michigan had to rely on its 
stellar pitching, with final scores being 
relatively low. But the Wolverines 
have slowly righted the ship since 
then, 
finding 
offense 
not 
only 

more frequently but with a greater 
consistency. That trend culminated in 
their performance against the Nittany 
Lions.

Michigan dominates Illinois, 19-4

EVANSTON – By the bottom of the 

sixth inning, everyone in the lineup 
had a hit besides senior left fielder 
Danny 
Zimmerman. 
Zimmerman 

finally joined the party, smashing a 
two-run home run that extended 
the Michigan baseball team’s lead to 
double digits and put the game even 
further out of Illinois’ reach.

In the second game of Sunday’s 

doubleheader, the Wolverines (21-11) 
not only beat the Illini (15-16) to secure 
a 2-2 series tie — they posted one of 
their most complete performances of 
the year and dominated Illinois, 19-4, 
in a seven-inning, run-ruled game.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich made 

drastic changes to the starting lineup 
from the first game. With fifth-year 
catcher Griffin Mazur serving the 

second game of his suspension, fifth-
year Christian Molfetta, who usually 
plays third base, took his place. Junior 
right-hander Willie Weiss, usually 
the closer, made the first start of his 
Michigan career. 

“Willie’s been so good,” Bakich 

said. “We wanted to try to keep them 
off the scoreboard for a couple of 
innings so we could try to score, but it 
didn’t work out that way.”

Instead, the Illini got off to a hot 

start in the top of the first against 
Weiss, who struggled to throw 
strikes. Weiss walked two of the first 
three hitters he faced, both of whom 
scored on a pair of singles later in the 
inning. Illinois’ momentum would 
soon disappear.

Michigan began to take advantage 

of poor pitching by the Illini in 
the bottom of the first, loading the 
bases on two walks and a single. 
Sophomore first baseman Tito Flores’ 

infield single scored one run and 
reloaded the bases for sophomore 
third baseman Ted Burton, who 
cleared the table with a grand slam. 
Fifth-year center fielder Christian 

Bullock’s opposite-field home run 
gave the Wolverines a commanding 
7-2 lead after just one inning.

Weiss settled in at the top of the 

second, striking out two, although he 

consistently got behind in the count. 
Redshirt sophomore left-hander Ben 
Dragani relieved him in the third and 
threw four innings of two-run ball. 

“He does what he does: comes 

in, gets the job done,” Bullock said. 
“Good control of his change-up on 
both sides of the plate, and he was 
really huge for us.”

Dragani got hitters to chase his 

offspeed pitches in the dirt, and the 
defense handled everything put in 
play, most of which was weakly hit. 
In the third, fifth-year shortstop 
Benjamin Sems fielded a ground ball 
in the shallow outfield and threw to 
first, just in time to make the out. In 
the fourth, sophomore third baseman 
Ted 
Burton, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

second 
baseman 
Jordon 
Rogers 

and Flores turned an inning-ending 
double play.
