ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Students reflect on 

progress toward 
goals, current 
campus climate

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

As the Black Student Union 

honors the second anniversary 
of its 2013 #BBUM Twitter 

campaign, dozens crowded into 
the Trotter House Multicultural 
Center on Thursday night for 
a candid conversation on the 
lasting impacts of the campaign 
on the University.

Started by Black Student Union 

members as way for students of 
color to share their experiences 
as Black students on campus, 
in 
November 
2013, 
#BBUM 

went viral, accumulating more 
than 10,000 tweets by the first 
evening of its launch.

The 
movement 
captivated 

the attention of the University 
community and inspired similar 
efforts at other college campuses.

During 
Thursday’s 
event, 

which was hosted by the BSU, 
members displayed tweets from 
2014 that were critical of the 
#BBUM movement.

Some 
attendees 
connected 

negative reactions to #BBUM 
with 
negative 
reactions 
to 

arecent campus demonstration 
on the Diag in solidarity with 

protests at the University of 
Missouri.

Several 
shared 
Facebook 

comments and tweets posted 
during 
and 
after 
the 
Diag 

demonstration. Another student 
shared an anecdote of a friend 
being threatened by a white 
man not to participate in the 
demonstration.

During the event, University 

alum Veniece Session said there 
are still strides to be made

January strategic 

meeting marks 

third year board has 

met privately

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

At Thursday’s meeting of the 

University’s Board of Regents, 
Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs (D) 
announced that the board will 
participate in a private session 
in January in lieu of its regular 
monthly meeting.

The regents have held private, 

strategic planning sessions in 
January for the past three years. 
A private session was held in 
California in 2013, New York in 
2014 and Ann Arbor in 2015. This 
year’s session is slated to be held 
in Detroit.

Before 2013, a regular meeting 

open to the public was usually 
held in January.

“Holding an annual strategic 

planning session has proven 
very useful to the regents and 
to the University,” Ryder Diggs, 
who chairs the board, said at 
Thursday’s meeting.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said the board had 
the opportunity to interact with 
other leaders in higher education 
from different parts of the 
country during previous strategic 
sessions.

“This is really an opportunity 

for 
the 
board 
to 
do 
some 

strategic thinking in a less formal 
atmosphere where there’s no 
decisions being made,” he said. 
“It’s just sort of a blue sky kind of 
session.”

During their 2014 trip to New 

York, the board met with leaders 
from several colleges on the East 
Coast, including William Bowen, 
Princeton University professor 
emeritus, 
Yale 
University 

President Peter Salovey, Michael 
Johns, retired executive vice 
president for health affairs at 
Emory University and Edward

Zinc-oxide could 

coat medical 

devices to prevent 
bacteria’s spread

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

In the hands of University 

researchers, sunscreen may do 
more than just protect our skin: 
It might also protect our medical 
devices from bacteria that kill 
more than 100,000 Americans 
every year.

In a paper published Oct. 

27, a University research team 
showed 
that 
coating 
objects 

with nanoparticles of zinc oxide, 
a key ingredient in sunscreen, 
reduced the growth of a species 
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by 
95 percent.

In 
hospitals, 
where 

antibiotics are used extensively, 
particularly dangerous bacteria 
like 
methicillin 
resistant 

Staphylococcus 
aureus 
— 
or 

MRSA — evolve because they 
are able to survive antibiotic 
treatments. If these bacteria get 
on objects like replacement joints, 
artificial heart valves or screws 
used 
with 
common 
athletic 

injuries, they can multiply inside 
a patient’s body and cause severe 
infections that can’t easily be 
cured with antibiotics.

If bacteria can’t grow on the 

objects in the first place, however, 
antibiotic resistance poses less of 
a problem. This is where the zinc 
oxide nanoparticles could help.

Medical 
School 
Lecturer 

J. Scott VanEpps, head of the 
research team that presented 
the 
findings, 
said 
the 
field 

of 
antibacterial 
coatings 
is 

important because of its life-
saving implications.

“About 
a 
million 
medical 

devices 
are 
infected 
every 

year,” VanEpps said. “The best 
way to treat this is often to 
take the infected device out. 
It’s relatively simple if you’re 
removing 
something 
like 
a 

catheter. But when you’re talking 
about removing a heart valve or 
prosthetic joint, that requires a 
long, taxing surgery that could 
involve complications.”

Engineering 
Prof. 
Nicholas 

Kotov is head of the chemical 
engineering 
laboratory 
that 

synthesized the nanoparticles. 
While 
zinc 
oxide’s 
bacteria-

fighting properties are relatively 
well known, examining different 
shapes it forms on the nanoscopic 
scale is an area of active research. 
The 
researchers 
examined 

whether 
the 
shape 
of 
the 

particles mattered, testing three 
different types: spheres, plates 
and pyramids with hexagonal 
bases. They produced four kinds 
of pegs: uncoated, coated with 
spheres, coated with plates and 
coated with hexagonal pyramids.

VanEpps’s team took pegs and 

put them in a bacteria-growing 
environment. After giving the 
bacteria 24 hours to grow, they 
found that the pegs coated with 
the nanopyramids had 95 percent 
fewer Staph bacteria — including 
MRSA — than the uncoated pegs.

While 
the 
researchers 

know that the nanopyramids

Law student Sarah Alsaden shines the light from her phone at a rally in support of Syrian refugees in the Law Quad 
on Thursday. The Racial Justice Coalition and the Muslim Law Students Association held the rally as a response to 
spreading Islamophobia following the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. 

Event aims to 
counter spread 
of Islamophobic 

sentiments

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Omar El-Halwagi, a second 

year 
Law 
student, 
began 

Thursday night’s vigil — held for 
the victims of recent terrorist 
attacks in Paris and Beirut — 
with an anecdote.

He told of a boy in Texas who 

donated all the money in his 
piggy bank to the local mosque 
after hearing it was vandalized 
in wake of the attacks.

“As 
we 
are 
here 
today 

reflecting 
on 
peace, 
we’re 

reflecting on the attacks, we’re 
reflecting on Islamophobia and 

racism on our campus and the 
marginalization of voices of 
color,” he said. “Every now and 
then, all you need is a glimpse of 
hope.”

That was the message as 

about 50 students gathered 
in the Law Quadrangle for a 
peace rally which addressed 
recent waves of Islamophobia 
following the attacks. The attack 
in Paris spurred an increase 
in 
discriminatory 
backlash 

toward Muslims, particularly 
Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS for 
the United States. Michigan 
Gov. Rick Snyder, along with 
several dozen other governors, 
have called for a temporary or 
permanent halt to the entry of 
Syrian refugees into their states.

Organized 
by 
the 
Racial 

Justice Coalition and the Muslim 
Law Student Association, aimed 
to give students the opportunity 
to express their feelings about 

the attacks, as well as voice 
concerns about Islamophobia as 
a reaction to them.

The Islamic State claimed 

responsibility for the Nov. 13 
attacks, which killed 129 people, 
on Saturday, according to the 
Washington Post.

El-Halwagi, 
who 
is 
the 

co-president of MLSA, opened 
the rally by reflecting on his 
reaction to the Paris attacks, as 
well as separate attacks in Beirut 
Nov. 12 in which a pair of suicide 
bombers killed 43 people and 
injured 239 others.

“(I 
felt) 
this 
feeling 
of 

hopelessness when last Friday 
I learned about the over 130 
people who were killed in Paris, 
while I was still dealing with 
the hopelessness from the day 
before as those same individuals 
were killed in Beirut,” he said. 
“While I was then dealing with

Initiative follows 
death of ‘U’ alum 
from co-ingestion 
of adderall, alcohol

Central 
Student 

Government will partner with 
the College of Pharmacy and 
Wolverine Wellness to launch 
a prescription drug misuse 
awareness campaign during 
the Winter 2016 semester.

The initiative was driven in 

part by the death of University 
alum Josh Levine, who passed 
away from an overdose after 
mixing adderall with alcohol 
at a party.

The campaign aims to 

focus 
on 
the 
correlation 

between academic pressures 
and drug abuse, and will 
launch at a time when the 
CSG representatives planning 
the event said they expect 
on-campus drug use to spike 
— during midterms.

LSA junior David Schafer, 

a CSG representative working 
on the project, said it is 
important to raise awareness 
about how academic pressure 
can impact drug abuse and 
the effects of that abuse, 
particularly 
on 
college 

campuses.

A 
survey 
from 
the 

University Substance Abuse 
Research Center found that 
Adderall 
ranked

Technology developed by ‘U’ 
profs. to help treat leukemia

Speaker talks Disneyland,

Molecular inhibitor 
could halt cancer by 
breaking up protein 

interactions

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

After two University profes-

sors helped develop a new tech-
nology designed to treat a severe 
form of leukemia, they licensed 
the discovery to a company 
focused on creating new thera-
pies for cancer patients. Now, 
that company has made it to the 
NASDAQ stock exchange.

In recent years, University 

officials have touted the success 
of programs designed to help 
University 
researchers 
bring 

their discoveries to the market-
place. This technology repre-
sents one such example.

The new technology, devel-

oped in part by Jolanta Grem-
becka and Tomasz Cierpicki, 

assistant professors of pathology, 
was licensed by California-based 
clinical biopharmaceutical com-
pany Kura Oncology in March. 
The University holds stock with-
in Kura Oncology, according to a 
press release.

The technology supported by 

University research specifically 
works on treating a severe form 
of mixed-lineage leukemia.

Grembecka 
added 
that 

because the type of leukemia 
they are targeting is so aggres-
sive — only one-third of patients 
survive more than five years — 
there is a large need for develop-
ing new therapies.

“The 
technology 
is 
(the) 

development of small molecules, 
which we believe, or hope, might 
have a future to repel a certain 
sub-type of leukemia called MLL 
leukemia,” she said. “This is an 
aggressive leukemia which actu-
ally affects both children and 
adults and there’s no cure cur-
rently for this type of leukemia.”

Grembecka said to combat the 

MLL leukemia, the University 

team’s research designed menin-
MLL inhibitors, which can help 
target the protein interactions 
responsible for specific types of 
leukemia.

Leukemia develops in the 

body partially through protein 
interactions, rendering molecu-
lar inhibitors like the menin-
MLL ones important because 
they can potentially deter these 
interactions and stop the prog-
ress of the disease.

Because of the large role of 

protein interactions in the dis-
ease, Grembecka said finding a 
correct design for an inhibitor 
could be a crucial new avenue to 
treat this previously incurable 
type of leukemia.

“Based on the known scien-

tific literature, it was recognized 
that the protein interaction is 
very relevant to the develop-
ment of the disease. Invoking 
this interaction with small mol-
ecules, we thought, might be a 
great idea to inhibit develop-
ment or progression of the dis-
ease,” she said. “We hope that 
the inhibitors will block pro-
gression of the disease.”

Due to the confidentiality of 

the research, specific informa-
tion about the treatment’s prog-
ress was not available, and the 
professors involved in the study 
declined to facilitate interviews 
with student members of the 
team.

The 
University’s 
partner-

ship with Kura Oncology on the 
technology has allowed both 
sides to advance the research, 
Grembecka said, with both her 
and Cierpicki working with 
experts nationwide to continue 
the research they independently 
started at the University.

Wellspring Biosciences, Jans-

sen 
Pharmaceutica 
and 
the 

University of California, San 
Francisco, were also involved.

In a press release, Ken Nisbet, 

associate vice president for Tech 
Transfer, said he was proud of 
the technology’s progress.

Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, gives a lecture on child health policy and the 
importance of vaccinations at the Kahn Auditorium on Thursday.

Annual lecture on 
child health aims 
to merge multiple 

academic disciplines

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Karen Smith, director of the 

California Department of Public 
Health, gave the ninth annual 
Susan B. Meister Lecture in 
Child Health Policy on Thursday 
in light of the measles outbreak 
last December at Disneyland. 
The lecture, titled “The Power 
of the Public Eye: Disneyland, 
Measles, and Public Policy,” was 
held in Kahn Auditorium at the 
Biomedical Science Research 
Building.

The lecture is hosted by the 

University’s Child Health Evalu-
ation and Research Unit, and 
features talks on child health 
topics. Meister is the founding 
chair of the Board of Advisors 
for CHEAR, an interdisciplinary 
research unit bringing members 

from different fields together — 
such as pediatrics, pharmacy, 
business, social work, dentistry 
and law — to address current 
child health issues.

Smith, a University alum, said 

“herd immunity” is the main 
reason for getting people vac-
cinated. Herd immunity refers 
to a phenomenon when most of 
a community is vaccinated and 
immunized against a contagious 
disease, even community mem-
bers who are not able to get vac-
cinated or have compromised 
immune systems are protected 
against the disease.

Herd immunity, as its name 

suggests, is only effective when 
most 
community 
members 

are vaccinated. Unfortunately, 
Smith said, the anti-vaccination 
sentiment has spread substan-
tially and has become increas-
ingly present in California since 
2010, when a booster pertussis 
(whooping cough) vaccination 
shot became mandatory for sev-
enth graders.

Smith said the anti-vaccina-

tion sentiment is not evenly dis-
tributed throughout the state 

— some communities have more 
anti-vaxxers than others.

“(The anti-vaxxers) were gen-

erally fairly well-off Caucasian 
families,” Smith said.

The increasing number of 

unvaccinated people increases 
risk for outbreaks like the recent 
measles outbreak at Disney-
land. The measles outbreak is an 
example of this pattern. Though 
the disease was eradicated in the 
U.S. in 2000, the disease remains 
widespread in many countries 
outside of North and South 
America.

Because Disneyland attracts 

about 24 million visitors per 
year, many of whom hail from 
countries where measles is still 
prevalent, the amusement park 
has been a prime spot for conta-
gious diseases. Another measles 
outbreak that originated from 
Disneyland in 1982.

Smith also addressed the link 

between vaccination and autism, 
saying there is no causal link in 
spite of anti-vaxxers’ arguments. 
In 1998, former British physician 
Andrew Wakefield published a

Lucky 

Lakshman 
Mulpuri, 
a 
CSG 

representative involved in the 
planning, said the campaign will 
focus on opioids, depressants and 
stimulants.

Mulpuri said he hopes the 

campaign will not demonize the 
drugs, but will instead focus on 
emphasizing the fact that they’re 
prescribed by doctors for a reason.

“It 
feels 
like 
a 
real 
and 

tangible step towards addressing

on 

campus,” Mulpuri said.

The 
campaign, 
which 
will 

begin the last week of January 
and run until the first week of 
February, will contain five events 
that will alternate every other 
day. It’s slated to begin with an 
informational video on adderall 
abuse featuring the University 

football team, members of the 
University’s chapter of Theta Chi, 
the fraternity Levine belonged to, 
and other students willing to share 
their stories.

Pharmacy Student Government 
Council, said the dean of student 
services for the Pharmacy School, 
expressed interest in the school 
supporting the initiative. Along 
with providing speakers for the 
panel, the school also plans to 
screen any factual information on 
stimulants before it is used in the 
campaign.

Schafer said it is important the 

campaign speaks to students while 
remaining 
inclusive 
for 
those 

affected by the problem.

“It shouldn’t come from a 

pedantic or overly condescending 
place,” Schafer said. “CSG members 
also face these unbelievably high 
academic pressures, and we don’t 
want to see students using these 
drugs.”

The campaign is expected to 

conclude with a signature drive 
asking students to pledge not to 
abuse prescription medicines. 

in building a stronger Black 
community at the University.

“Being a freshman here, 

when I first got here, I felt 
like I wasn’t a good enough 
Black student because I wasn’t 
involved yet. I didn’t know 
what Black organizations I 
wanted to join,” she said. “If 
we as upperclassmen are here 
and seeing new faces, let’s be 
inclusive and talk to Black 
people. Talk to people you 
haven’t seen before. Let’s have 
some type of inclusivity within 
our own culture so there isn’t a 
hierarchy of Blackness.”

Attendees also reflected on 

a 2014 Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day demonstration held by BSU 
members on the steps of Hill 
Auditorium.

Holding black signs with 

tweets written in white chalk, 
members protested low minority 
enrollment and demanded the 
University meet seven goals for 
improving campus climate and 
diversity of the student body.

A new location for the Trotter 

Center and an improved race 
and ethnicity requirement were 
among the demands made by 
the BSU. Additionally, the BSU 
demanded an increase to Black 
student enrollment equal to 10 
percent. 

The University has since 

addressed some of the demands 
outlined by the BSU, including 
granting 
the 
organization 

$60,000, for funding a variety 
of student groups on campus, 
an increase from the $37,000 
previously 
allocated 
to 
the 

organization. The University 
also 
approved 
Intergroup 

Relations 
courses 
to 
count 

toward the race and ethnicity 
distribution requirement, and 
increased the classes’ credit 
value from two credits to three.

Officials 
also 
digitized 

Bentley 
Historical 
Library 

documents with information 
on the Black Action Movement 
of the 1960s. The BSU made 
the demand with the aim of 
increasing 
the 
University’s 

transparency on past dealings 
with Black student activists.

During 
Thursday’s 
event, 

one student said he thinks it’s 
unnecessary to keep making 
new 
demands 
when 
the 

demands from previous Black 
activist 
movements 
haven’t 

been met.

Former 
BSU 
Treasurer 

Robert Greenfield, a University 
alum, said gaining total support 
from the Black community 
on campus is necessary to 
substantiate the demands.

“We first need 100-percent 

buy-in of the Black community, 
and the problem is that in the 
past, action movements and 
social action on campus, there 
hasn’t been that 100-percent 
buy-in,” he said. “The football 
players and basketball players, 
we need them. I think that in 
the University setting, that’s the 
only way we’re gonna really get 
those demands met.”

Discussions 
between 
the 

BSU, University administration 
and other community members 
are ongoing. Last week, the 
University held a weeklong 
Diversity 
Summit 
intended 

to 
garner 
input 
from 
the 

community about improving 

equality 
and 
inclusion 
on 

campus.

In a statement Thursday, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel thanked the BSU for 
participating in a meeting with 
him and E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life. 

“I would further like to 

thank the members of the Black 
Student Union who joined Vice 
President Harper and me last 
Friday for breakfast, as part of 
our ongoing dialogue over the 
past year,” he said. “Though the 
breakfast had been scheduled 
for weeks, the timing gave us 
the opportunity to discuss the 
nationwide campus issues of 
racism and inequality.”

Schlissel also lauded students 

for engaging in dialogues about 
racism and discrimination on 
college campuses. 

Along 
with 
discussing 

campus 
efforts 
over 
the 

past 
few 
years, 
presenters 

Thursday also dedicated time 
to celebrating how #BBUM had 
strengthened ties within the 
Black community.

BSU 
Political 
Action 

Chair Diego Zimmerman, a 
sophomore in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance and 
the College of Engineering, 
said he remembered the warm 
greetings he received when he 
came to his first BSU meeting.

“I remember my first BSU 

meeting: Everybody said ‘What’s 
up,’ met everyone, had the best 
time,” he said. “I remember that 
feeling of community I never got 
anywhere else. I remembered I 
need to stay here — my family is 
here.”

LSA senior Arnold Reed, 

former 
BSU 
speaker, 
said 

throwing tailgates on game days 
helped draw Black students 
closer together and is something 
younger students should also 
emulate.

“I want you guys to know, 

especially 
younger 
students, 

when it comes to throwing 
events or doing things that you 
feel like you don’t normally have 
access to, do it,” he said. “Know 
that this group right here is 
going to always support you.”

During the event, Kinesiology 

senior 
Cap 
Kendall 
said 

building 
relationships 
with 

faculty members would also be 
helpful in unifying the Black 
community.

“I 
think 
oftentimes 
as 

undergraduates 
you 
often 

forget that there are faculty and 
professional students who are 
also our allies (and) are here 
to help us,” she said. “We need 
to open up more and let them 
participate in conversation like 
this.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily after the event, 
LSA senior Chris James, a BSU 
executive board member, said 
holding Thursday’s event was 
vital in inspiring younger Black 
students to continue the efforts 
of past BSU members.

“#BBUM started two years, 

so with the new incoming 
freshmen, they don’t always get 
to see the up close and personal 
of what happens on campus 
before they got here,” he said. 
“It’s so important to have 
this so they can carry it with 
themselves and keep holding 
the University accountable for 
what they say they’re gonna do. 
We have to keep this fire going.”

president for health affairs at 
Johns Hopkins University.

Johns was chosen last year to 

serve as interim chief executive 
officer of University of Michigan 
Health System through March.

The board’s trip to Los Angeles 

in 2013 involved meeting with 
Robert 
Birgeneau, 
former 

chancellor of the University of 
California, 
Berkeley, 
Stanford 

University 
President 
John 

Hennessy, Robert Berdahl, former 
president of the Association of 
American Universities and Dan 
Russell, a top Google research 
scientist.

Fitzgerald 
also 
said 
the 

strategic planning sessions serve 
as opportunities for the board to 
interact with University alumni. 
The board’s meeting in New York 
was accompanied by a fundraising 

dinner at Lincoln Center. At 
this year’s strategic planning 
meeting, the regents will interact 
with alumni in Detroit, an area 
heavily populated with University 
alumni.

There 
are 
almost 
60,000 

alumni in the greater Detroit area, 
one of the highest concentrations 
nationwide.

As he enters his second year, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel has also focused on 
strengthening the University’s 
connection to the city of Detroit. 
At an Amazon press conference 
in the city this past September, 
he emphasized the University’s 
annual 
student-led 
Detroit 

Partnership Day, in which 1,500 
students participate in projects 
across the city. In August, he 
hosted an event commending the 
work of students and interns in 
the city.

The 
next 
regular 
regents 

meeting will take place Dec 17. 

could prevent these dangerous 
infections, how the exact process 
works 
remains 
undiscovered. 

VanEpps said the key may be 
the nanoparticles’ shape, which 
enables them to inhibit certain 
enzymes important for bacterial 
growth.

Because 
zinc 
oxide 

nanopyramids 
can 
inhibit 

multiple bacterial enzymes while 
antibiotics 
normally 
disrupt 

just one, it may be much harder 

for bacteria to evolve resistance 
against the nanoparticles.

“We’ve seen that the zinc oxide 

nanopyramids 
hinder 
biofilm 

growth, and it’s been shown that 
they inhibit certain enzymes. 
Next, we want to figure out how 
these two facts fit together,” 
VanEpps said.

The researchers plan to learn 

more about the nanoparticles 
before they can be adapted for 
medical use. For example, they 
will observe whether different 
concentrations of particles can 
inhibit other types of bacteria 
without harming human cells.

the hopelessness as I felt that no 
one cared about the people who 
died the day before because they 
simply look different and came 
from a different part to the world.”

First-year Law student Asma 

Husain, who spoke during the 
rally, said she often feels like 
she must bear the burden of her 
entire culture as a Muslim and 
answer for things she doesn’t 
agree with, such as the actions of 
extremists.

“Being a Muslim in America 

now means you have this kind of 
tax placed upon you,” she said. 
“Which means when anything 
happens that involves anyone 
whose identity has any tenuous 
or 
untrue 
or 
contradictory 

connection to Islam or claims 
that connection, you feel like 
it is a weight put upon your 
shoulders to explain or apologize 
or distance yourself from those 
actions.”

First-year Law student Zahrah 

Fadel, who also spoke, echoed 
Husain’s sentiments.

She said groups like the Islamic 

State are trying to bring back 
the hatred and fear that existed 
following the 9/11 attacks.

“It took me years after I 

moved here from Lebanon. I 

was embarrassed to bring a pita 
sandwich to school for so long. I 
was embarrassed to admit that 
I was a Muslim, but I realized 
growing up that I’m American. 
I’m just as American as anyone 
else,” Fadel said. “We’ve (made) 
so much progress in this country 
to 
move 
from 
that 
divisive 

mindset, so let’s not go back. I 
don’t want this generation to 
grow up hopeless. I want us to 
grow up together.”

Along with speeches from 

community members, organizers 
also held a moment of silence 
for victims of terror worldwide, 
as well as taking a picture in 
solidarity with Parisians. 

Second 
year 
Law 
student 

Nicolas Kabat, president of the 
Racial Justice Coalition, said 
his inspiration for the rally 
came from how upset he saw 
members of his community were 
in response to the week’s events.

“I think everyone was very 

upset with the Paris attacks, and 
yet we were also equally upset by 
the response we were seeing from 
local politicians, from media 
pundits,” he said. “We wanted to 
have a rally that would show our 
solidarity with the victims of the 
Paris attacks and also show our 
solidarity with all Muslims in 
the U.S. and anyone experiencing 
hatred.”

study linking autism with measles, 
mumps and rubella vaccines, but 
in 2010, the study was retracted by 
the publishing journal because the 
study used false data to reach its 
conclusion.

In 1975, one out of 5,000 people 

were diagnosed with autism, but in 
2009, one in 110 were. Smith said 
the increase is due to the change 
in the diagnosis criteria and raised 
awareness of the condition, not 
vaccinations. Smith cited the 1988 
movie “Rain Man,” starring Dustin 
Hoffman as an autistic savant, as 
one of the reasons autism gained 

recognition in the society, for both 
the public and physicians.

“(Numbers) really took off when 

the movie ‘Rain Man’ came out,” 
Smith said. “It changed the prac-
tice. Even physicians recognized 
the changes in the diagnosis crite-
ria.”

Finally, Smith rebuked anti-

vaxxers argument that parents 
have the right to choose whether 
they vaccinate their children. 
Smith said not vaccinating the chil-
dren will put other children who 
cannot get vaccinated at risk.

“The society has the duty to pro-

tect (children who cannot get vac-
cinated) from people who could be 
vaccinated but choose not to,” she 
said.

Nobody cares about
 your fantasy team 

M

y fantasy football team is 10-0. It’s 
only tangentially related to this 
column, but I figured this was a 

good use of space to brag 
about it.

Yes, I just broke the 

first rule of fantasy foot-
ball: Nobody cares about 
your fantasy football team. 
Jeb Bush tried to brag 
about his somehow unde-
feated fantasy team dur-
ing a Republican debate, 
despite claiming to start 
Ryan Tannehill, and was 
promptly shut down by 
Chris Christie. Because it’s 
true: Nobody cares about your fantasy team. 

Nobody cares except for the government, 

that is. Eric Schneiderman, New York attor-
ney general, recently sent a cease-and-desist 
order to daily fantasy sports companies 
DraftKings and FanDuel, saying the busi-
nesses constituted illegal Internet gambling. 
Efforts by the companies to prevent the shut-
down ahead of a Nov. 25 court date failed, 
thus ending the contests in the state until 
litigation is resolved. The companies were 
allowed to exist because the Unlawful Inter-
net Gambling Enforcement Act, passed in 
2006, contained an exception noting that the 
restrictions outlined in the act did not apply 
to fantasy sports.

Yet these daily fantasy sports sites oper-

ate very differently than the standard week-
to-week format of fantasy leagues that were 
intended to be exempted under the law. In 
standard daily fantasy sports games, entrants 
are given some virtual salary cap, and must 
play the role of a virtual general manager to 
form a roster of players in which each player 
has a set price determined by the site. A con-
sistently very good player will have a high 
price. Thus, finding players who provide a 
good performance-to-price ratio is key to 
success. Real money is then “bet” — or entry 
fees are paid, depending on how you want to 
define it — on the real-life, in-game perfor-
mance of this built roster. 

Each company says it is a legal enterprise, 

based on the claim that the daily games are 
games of skill, not games of chance, since 
entrants can use existing knowledge of 
the sport and the players when building 
 

their roster.

These companies’ futures are staked on the 

designation of their game as a game of skill — 
so much so that employees of the companies 
staged a protest in Manhattan where they hid 
their employment status and chanted, “Game 
of skill! Game of skill!”

Like most betting games, there are certainly 

elements of skill, and daily fantasy sports at a 
basic level represent a classic problem in com-
putation theory called the knapsack problem. 
The idea is there is some fixed amount of space 
— in daily fantasy sports, a budget — and many 
objects that are assigned values — in this case, 
players. To build an ideal roster, objects must 
all be analyzed algorithmically to most effi-
ciently use the space to maximize the value 
of things in the space — in this case, the best 
player performance within the budget. 

The result is somewhat predictable: The 

numbers nerds who can build advanced algo-
rithms to both accurately predict players’ 
future performances and solve the knapsack 
problem to maximize the potential of their 
rosters are able to claim most of the win-
nings in the long run. According to a Sports 
Business Daily report, the top 1.3 percent of 
players paid on average $9,100 each in entry 
fees and profited $2,400 each, resulting in 
them taking a disproportionate 77 percent 

of all the payouts. Meanwhile, 80 percent of 
players represent a more average group that 
pays an average of $49 in entry fees with a 
net loss of $25. A smaller group representing 
5 percent of players is the “big fish,” who lose 
$1,100 on average. These numbers certainly 
suggest that it’s a game of skill, but only for 
the 1.3 percent of players who actually have 
the skills. 

Because along with the first rule of fantasy 

football, that nobody cares about your team, 
is the first rule of gambling: The house always 
wins. Data for one week, according to an 
ESPN analysis, showed that DraftKings made 
$2.6 million in profit off $25 million worth of 
entry fees that week, while FanDuel’s profit 
was $3.5 million off $20.6 million in entry 
fees. And that’s just one week. In 2014, Fan-
Duel brought in more than $1 billion in fees. 
That’s an incredible amount of money being 
moved with zero oversight or regulation like 
there is for other forms of gambling.

In reality, these daily fantasy sports sites 

are extremely similar to poker — a com-
parison that company executives have made 
themselves. In poker, while casual players 
will play on mostly intuition, similar to the 
80 percent of daily fantasy sports players who 
lose an average of $25 weekly, skilled players 
are able to quickly determine the odds they 
have of winning a hand, and adjust playing 
strategy accordingly. There are set odds in 
poker for obtaining certain combinations of 
cards and winning the pot, but there is also 
the unknown of the cards other players at the 
table have. There’s some predictability based 
on certain factors, such as playing and bet-
ting patterns, but not 100-percent certainty 
— just like how the future performance of 
sports players is predictable but also has vol-
atile results. Poker is considered gambling, 
and online poker experienced a similar boom 
before being phased out by law. Daily fantasy 
sports could be next. 

Daily fantasy sports are already incred-

ibly alluring, and official partnerships with 
sports teams and an inundation of advertis-
ing only serve to fuel the machine. Sixteen 
NFL teams have exclusive partnerships with 
FanDuel, and 12 with DraftKings. The NBA 
has an exclusive deal with FanDuel and also 
equity share in the company. DraftKings has 
exclusive partnerships with the MLB and 
ESPN. As John Oliver joked during his rant 
against daily fantasy sports, HBO has a part-
nership with FanDuel, so he noted his jokes 
were in a sense sponsored by the same com-
pany he was targeting. 

Daily fantasy sports do not fit the inten-

tion of the law, which was to exempt the low-
key office and friend pools that I myself have 
played in since I was in middle school, a fact 
that the author of the UIGEA law is even on 
record as stating. Fantasy sports are incredi-
bly fun, but also can be quite addictive. Add in 
betting and gambling, activities known to be 
extremely addictive, and daily fantasy sports 
become dangerous and immediately acces-
sible via the Internet. Even more dangerous 
is its focus on millennials, a group of people 
often unable to afford the costs of gambling.

There are moral arguments against the 

legalization of such gambling, but for better 
or worse, society has accepted and allowed it. 
The solution isn’t necessarily to outlaw daily 
fantasy sports, but simply to treat them as the 
sports gambling that they actually are and 
provide consumer safety regulations that are 
necessary for the industry. Nobody will ever 
care about your fantasy team, but it’s time 
they cared about the money behind it.

You do you

“I

’ve been wanting to make 
signs or something for 
our bedroom doors where 

we 
can 
each 

put 
whether 

we’re 
gone, 

asleep, 
busy, 

masturbating, 
mini 
golfing, 

whatever.” 

This 
was 

the 
text 
that 

I got from my 
housemate while 
I was at the gym. 
I 
laughed 
out 

loud. 
Mostly 

because it was 
funny, partially because it was 
uncomfortable. Wait, I thought. 
You can’t just throw masturbating in 
with mini golfing. I don’t need you to 
know when that’s going on.

It was something we had talked 

about, something we knew we 
both did, but even in our almost 
boundary-less relationship, it wasn’t 
something that was ever discussed 
in detail. But the more I thought 
about it, the less I cared. Why was I 
so afraid to put a sign up on my door?

According to a 2002 study at 

Pennsylvania 
State 
University, 

college-age 
women 
reported 

discussing sex-related topics with 
their best friend more than men 
did, and also reported feeling more 
comfortable doing so. There was 
only one exception: masturbation. 
The 
study 
reads, 
“Females 

reported 
more 
communication 

overall than did males on all 
topics, except for masturbation, 
which males reported discussing 
more frequently than did females. 
Women talked more about sexually 
transmitted 
diseases, 
sexual 

feelings, contraception and rape.”

While this was not actually 

surprising to me (I think I’ve 
discussed the topic of masturbation 
with a maximum of maybe six people 
in my life), it raises the question: 
Why are women more comfortable 
discussing such emotionally charged 
topics, such as STIs and rape, than 
they are discussing masturbation? 

Because 
most 
research 
on 

the topic states that only about 
25 
percent 
of 
women 
report 

reaching orgasm through vaginal 
intercourse, figuring out how to 
climax by other methods (read: the 
clitoris — ever heard of it? It’s the 
thing they don’t teach you about in 
sex ed) is imperative to a woman’s 
sexual satisfaction. Also, according 
to the Women’s Health Network, 
female masturbation has a lengthy 
list of health benefits, including 
helping prevent cervical infections, 
relieving 
UTIs, 
improving 

cardiovascular 
health, 
lowering 

the risk of type 2 diabetes, fighting 
insomnia, 
relieving 
depressive 

emotions and relieving stress. And 
of course, it helps women figure 
out what works for them, and how 
they can teach their partner(s) 
accordingly. Turns out, it’s actually 
a 
really 
awesome 
thing 
that 

improves both our physical and 
mental health. So why is it such an 
uncomfortable topic?

At 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 

semester, I went to the Safe Sex 
Store (R.I.P.) with my friend to give 
her emotional support in picking 
out her first vibrator. Because 
it’s something we’re taught to be 
ashamed of, it required three of us 
in total, adding up our respective 
fractions 
of 
shamelessness, 
to 

strut into that store, pick out a 
vibrator, not pretend it was a “gift” 
for a friend and exit onto South 

University feeling satisfied and, to 
be honest, a little badass. We were 
secretly telling the world that we 
could take shit into our own hands. 
You see, in our society, women 
are often exalted as objects that 
give men sexual pleasure (listen 
to literally any rap song), rather 
than being sexual agents. In other 
words, our job is to service others, 
rather than actively seek out our 
own pleasure. While these are 
probably not the explicit thoughts 
floating around in a woman’s head 
as she shies away from the topic 
of masturbation, it is something 
that is so deeply ingrained in our 
society, that it makes the notion of 
a woman “taking shit into her own 
hands” extremely uncomfortable — 
even more so than rape.

So to all of you out there who 

have a clitoris, I’m not asking you 
to call up your friends every time 
you masturbate (unless you guys 
are cool with that, you do you). I’m 
not demanding that everyone shout 
out their front door, “Don’t come 
in, I’m masturbating!” But it’s an 
important thing to talk about. I 
learned while writing this article 
that, according to a 2004 University 
of Michigan study, using saliva 
while masturbating could increase 
your risk of a yeast infection. Who 
knew? Definitely not me.

So go tell your friends! Don’t be 

afraid! Talking about this stuff is a 
way to learn, to improve our sexual 
health and to be the agents, not the 
objects, of our sexual pleasure.

In the meantime, I’ll be listening 

to Nicki and Beyoncé’s “Feeling 
Myself” while I make a big, sparkly 
pink sign for my door.

Is self-defense just a Band-Aid?
T

his past Saturday at 10:00 
a.m. sharp, I found myself 
in Room 3275 of the Cen-

tral 
Campus 

Recreational 
Building 
wear-

ing cropped leg-
gings and a loose 
fitting 
T-shirt. 

The other 50 or 
so young under-
graduate women 
surrounding me 
were 
dressed 

so 
similarly, 
it 

seemed as if we 
were all wear-
ing the uniform of a hungover 
 

sorority girl.

We had gathered to participate 

in a self-defense class hosted by 
our chapter president, who, with 
her black belt in karate, is entirely 
capable of beating someone to a 
pulp. She was accompanied by her 
instructor, who could also undoubt-
edly smash in someone’s face given 
the chance.

Our sorority’s philanthropy focus-

es on raising awareness and support-
ing victims of domestic violence, and 
our (mandatory) attendance to this 
class was framed in terms of increas-
ing empowerment and self-agency in 
the face of assault. In addition to an 
overview on how to defend oneself 
against an attacker through targeted 
kicks to the groin and shins, all the 
money raised from the participation 
fee went to the Women’s Center of 
Southeastern Michigan, an organiza-
tion that supports women transition-
ing away from abusive relationships.

I had always wanted to learn self-

defense. The notion that, if I were 
to be attacked, I would know a few 
basic moves (besides screaming and 
running) to resist an attacker made 
me feel more confident in my body 
and my agency in the world. After a 
few goes at my roommate Paige, who 
held up a padded shield to her right, I 
was proficient in an upward hit with 
the palm of my hand meant to break 
an attacker’s nose. By the end of the 
class, I was a little too confident and 
accidentally smacked another wom-
an’s arm on my quick withdrawal 

and resumption of a dominant stance 
— still sorry about that, Maria.

But as powerful as I felt, I had a 

hard time totally committing to the 
notion of self-defense as a realis-
tic, effective method of preventing 
violence against women. I was all 
on board with some of the first tac-
tics we talked about, like awareness 
of your surroundings, avoidance 
of potentially unsafe situations 
and overall assertive self-conduct. 
However, all of these suggestions 
weren’t physical moves, and instead 
seemed mostly like common sense.

What I couldn’t get past was the 

underlying doubt that if I were to 
be attacked, would I really think in 
the moment to assume a dominant 
position and kick my attacker in the 
groin? If he goes for my face, would 
I remember to grab his weak wrist 
and, in the quintessential wax-on/
wax-off motion (yes, Karate Kid 
was technically accurate), twist his 
hands away from me? If he grabs 
my ponytail, would I grab the hair 
closest to my scalp so the pain is 
more tolerable and try to hit back?

I’m sure that some women who 

have been trained in self-defense 
have successfully employed these 
tactics in the context of an actual 
attack, and I applaud them. Even 
though it’s difficult to measure, 
studies have shown that women 
who participate in self-defense 
classes are more confident in their 
ability to resist assault, less likely to 
experience sexual assault and more 
angry than scared during an assault 
than women without training.

Though these results make sense, 

I wonder what role self-selection 
had in the outcomes; one could 
argue that the type of woman who 
would seek out self-defense train-
ing would already be more likely 
to avoid situations where she’s at a 
higher risk for assault (making her 
less likely to experience assault) 
and more likely to respond assert-
ively and aggressively to an attack 
from the get-go (making her more 
confident in her ability to defend).

Further, attacks against women 

don’t always look like late-night 
muggings by a stranger, and this 

reality can dwarf the effectiveness 
of self-defense. Namely, the nature 
of sexual assault — a disturbing-
ly common crime against female 
undergraduates — means that self-
defense tactics may not be particu-
larly helpful. Because four out of five 
rapes are committed by someone 
known to the victim, and 62 percent 
of victims report drinking alcohol 
just prior to the incident, sexual 
assault looks very little like other 
violent crimes against women. As a 
result, even a woman fully compe-
tent in self-defense might not be in a 
position in which she could success-
fully defend herself against rape. 

And on top of all this, the simple 

fact that self-defense classes exist, 
and are oftentimes exclusively 
for women, is upsetting. When a 
woman enrolls in a self-defense 
class, she’s predicting that at some 
time in the potentially near future, 
she’ll inevitably and unexpectedly 
be subject to violence.

With that thought, I suddenly 

realized that my outfit choice wasn’t 
the only thing I had in common with 
the young, undergraduate women 
surrounding me in the CCRB. As a 
demographic, we also share a similar 
vulnerability to assault and violence 
against us. Was this hour of self-
defense training really addressing 
the root of this issue or merely serv-
ing as a Band-Aid to a wider, more 
pervasive societal ill?

But the knee-jerk argument that 

self-defense distracts from the larg-
er issue of violence against women, 
though valid, is unfortunately not 
particularly helpful in terms of pro-
tecting women against assault here 
and now. In theory, self-defense 
gives women greater agency in 
their abilities to defend themselves, 
and empowers women with greater 
agency and control. These are all 
good things, and keeping them in 
mind was the only way I could rec-
oncile the disturbing notion that 
one day, rather than a soft, padded 
shield, I might be kicking some-
one’s actual groin to defend myself.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘Faking It’: the rule-
breaker we all need

MTV show goes 

beyond stereotypes 

in its characters

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

“Faking It” has never gar-

nered the ratings that MTV’s 
other realistic teen comedy 
series “Awkward” gained over 
the course of its first two sea-
sons. There could be many rea-
sons for that. To begin, it has 
an objectively silly premise: 
two best friends pretend to be 
lesbians to get popular at their 
liberal Austin high school. In 
the act of “faking it,” Amy (Rita 
Volk, “The Hungover Games”) 
realizes that she actually has 
feelings for Karma (Katie Ste-
vens, “American Idol”), her best 
friend.

The first season began by 

exploring this pretend relation-
ship, and it was entertaining 
fluff. There are some good jokes 
as Hester High School satirically 
reverses the stereotypical high 
school food chain in the same 
way that “21 Jump Street” made 
the nerds popular and the ath-
letes the underdogs. However, 
there were no real stabs at social 
commentary in the first season.

The second season, which 

ended on Nov. 2, took “Faking 
It” in a whole new direction. 
The original premise, while 
occasionally being referenced 
for laughs, is mostly thrown 
out in favor of exploring these 
characters’ inner struggles in 
real and honest ways. While 
most shows would immediately 
classify Amy as a closeted les-
bian, “Faking It” illustrates that 
sexuality lies on a spectrum. In 
the second half of the second 
season, Amy finds herself sur-
prised to have feelings for new 
kid Felix (Parker Mack, “For 
the Booth”). When questioned 
about 
being 
bisexual, 
Amy 

can only muster up an unsure 
“maybe.” Amy’s unwillingness 
to box herself into a neat cat-

egory defines the main arc of 
the series, and it’s a surprisingly 
complex topic to tackle.

Even more radical than Amy’s 

characterization is that of Lau-
ren (Bailey De Young, “Bun-
heads”), Amy’s stepsister. The 
season two premiere features 
the revelation that Lauren is 
intersex, an identity hardly ever 
explored on TV, much less by one 
of the main characters in a main-
stream teen comedy. One of the 
most touching moments of the 
season two finale features Lau-
ren openly declaring her sexual 
identity to the school board. She 
says that before she’d come to 
Hester, she’d never been able to 
say that out loud.

Encouraging 
people 
to 

embrace their weirdness isn’t 
unique to “Faking It.” “Be 
yourself” is probably the big-
gest inspirational cliché in teen 
drama. In Hester High School, 
however, “Faking It” has found 
a setting specifically dedicated 
to it. This is a school where the 
Queen Bee is intersex and the 
big man on campus is gay, where 
people actually fake being differ-
ent to attain popularity.

Even setting aside the pro-

gressiveness of its message, the 
narrative of “Faking It” is very 
well-written. So much teen 
drama on TV is based around 
keeping secrets and lying, but 
no secret stays hidden for long 
on this show. One standout 
episode in particular, “Boiling 

Point,” traps all the main char-
acters in one room for deten-
tion in an overt homage to “The 
Breakfast Club.” In this episode, 
all the conflicts that have been 
building throughout the season 
come to a head. Karma admits 
that her ex-boyfriend Liam’s 
(Gregg Sulkin, “Pretty Little 
Liars”) father wants to pay her 
to stay away from him, and her 
precarious financial situation is 
forcing her to consider it. Most 
cathartically, Shane (Michael J. 
Willett, “G.B.F.”), the gay guy 
notorious for outing people, is 
finally called out for his destruc-
tive habit. “You can’t just do the 
wrong thing and pretend it’s for 
the right reason,” Liam points 
out. Most refreshingly, this 
all happens in episode 15 of a 
20-episode season. Many shows 
would wait until the finale to 
disrupt the peace, but “Faking 
It” moves the plot forward con-
siderably each episode.

This is a time when the view-

ership for shows like “Degras-
si” and “Awkward” wanes and 
genre shows like “Teen Wolf” 
hold the most weight among 
teen audiences. “Faking It” 
provides a funny, relatively 
new series that’s defiant in 
its breaking of stereotypes. It 
offers characters of all sexu-
alities, genders and sexes, yet 
refuses to define them by those 
identifiers. It’s the realistic yet 
over-the-top TV series that 
audiences deserve.

“There’s something good on MTV?”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Young & Sick blends 
electronic and soul

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

“Hard to tell where the skies 

end and the water begins / All cov-
ered in sunlight and it’s not even 
spring.”

The opening lyrics of Young & 

Sick’s self-titled debut album set 
the tone for the rest of the work, 
focusing on subjective yet univer-
sal experiences of all young adults. 
Released in April 2014, Young & 
Sick combines soul, electronic and 
R&B music to share thoughts on 
love, life and adolescence.

Created by Dutch artist Nick 

Van Hofwegen, Young & Sick is a 
Los Angeles-based music and art 
project. While they started their 
career by covering full albums 
for major acts like Foster the 
People and Maroon 5 and posting 
the songs online, Young & Sick’s 
designs were featured in a fashion 
line by Urban Outfitters in 2012. By 
the winter of 2014, Young & Sick 
played its first live show and was 
announced to play at the Coachella 
Festival. Today, Young & Sick con-
tinues to foster their triple-threat 
status by creating album artwork 
for artists like Mikky Ekko, Robin 
Thicke and Maroon 5.

Despite being categorized as 

soul and R&B music, Young & Sick 
transcends these labels and com-
bines synthetic beats with tradi-
tional instruments to create an 
entirely new genre. The album’s 
opening song, “Mangrove,” is 
soothing and repetitive, using 
simple mediums and upbeat har-
monies to question life. Lyrics like 
“I feel the best I have in my life / 
Something must be very wrong” 
contemplate 
darker 
themes 

through a lighthearted instrumen-
tal.

“Counting 
Raindrops” 
uses 

artificial riffs to emulate rain pat-
ter, using seductive and sultry lyr-
ics such as “Let the rain overflow 
and keep us here / Kiss me like you 
would if this was our last,” while 
still maintaining its electronic 
and R&B roots. By incorporating a 
funky breakdown of electric piano 
and guitar in the middle of the 
song, Young & Sick sets themselves 
apart from other competitors in 
their field.

Conversely, 
“Gloom” 
moves 

away from electronica and heads 
toward jazz, incorporating tra-
ditional soulful instruments like 
trumpets and saxophones into 
a lust filled ballad. With harmo-
nizing falsetto and sultry lyrics, 
“Glass” encompasses a full swing 

band sound with relatively few 
instruments. Transitioning back 
into strong electronic, “Glass” uses 
artificial beats to musically dem-
onstrate the feeling of falling in 
and out of love. The lyrics, “Don’t 
keep me from falling deeper in love 
/ Pour me another lover,” demon-
strate the transient nature of lust 
and love and vocalize a cynical 
view of modern dating culture.

The closing song on Young 

& 
Sick, 
“Twentysomething,” 

describes adolescence by focus-
ing on lyrics rather than instru-
mentals. 
Getting 
into 
the 

mindset of a young adult, Young 
& Sick expresses the sentiments 
of many, singing, “Still not used 
to my skin / Loving the scars 
though / The cuts and bruises.” 
It leaves the listener with the 
feeling of being stuck between 
carefree and trapped, with one 
foot in adulthood and one left in 
childhood.

While Young & Sick’s debut 

album has thrust them onto 
music lover’s radars, their talent 
and ambition makes them an art-
ist to watch. Despite their lack of 
name recognition, Young & Sick 
is forging their own path through 
the industry. Keep your eyes (and 
ears) open.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Why can’t Disney do 
anything original?

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Between 2009 and 2016, Dis-

ney and Pixar will have released 
seven new animated movies: 
“Up,” “The Princess and the 
Frog,” 
“Frozen,” 
“Tangled,” 

“Brave,” “Inside Out” and the 
upcoming “Moana.” To put it 
in perspective, that’s two presi-
dential terms with only seven 
spunky Disney protagonists to 
counter the political strife brew-
ing in our hearts.

Yet in the past two years alone, 

Disney released four live-action 
remakes of classic stories: “Malef-
icent,” “Into the Woods,” “Cinder-
ella” and “Peter Pan.” Also in the 
works are remakes of “Beauty and 
the Beast,” “The Little Mermaid,” 
“The Jungle Book” and unsolidi-
fied plans to reimagine Dumbo, 
Winnie the Pooh, Tinkerbell and 
the genie from “Aladdin.” It has 
also been capitalizing on sequels, 
with the Pixar branch churning 
out an equal ratio of sequels to 
new films. “Toy Story 3” brought 
the supposedly definitive finale 
of the franchise, only for produc-
ers to turn around and stick in 
a fourth film because it was so 
profitable.

My nostalgic heart argues that 

well-made remakes can — and 
do — generate new artistic con-
tent that simply uses the original 
story as a loose baseline to tease 
out finer details and unique per-
spectives. It’s no wonder that 
powerhouse 
actors, 
directors 

and screenwriters vie for the 
prestigious responsibility of hon-
oring these treasured characters. 
Modern technology allows for 
increasingly sophisticated repro-

ductions of visual worlds. But if 
the original was so timeless, do 
we really need another version?

The box office screams yes. 

The prospect of seeing Lupi-
ta Nyong’o (“Twelve Years a 
Slave”), 
Scarlett 
Johansson 

(“Under the Skin”) and Bill Mur-
ray (“Rock The Kasbah”) sharing 
a screen — and romping through 
the forest from my worn “Jungle 
Book” VHS tape, no less — will 
inevitably draw me to the the-
ater. I probably won’t even watch 
the trailer; my loyalty to the star-
studded cast and a childhood 
favorite is enough.

While directors may, at times, 

be legitimately inspired by clas-
sic stories, it’s clear that the cur-
rent deluge of recycled material 
spawns not from passion alone. 
Disney saw the easy money and 
seized it. But restricting output 
to remakes confines the imagi-
nation to a single world of char-
acters and hampers personal 
creative expression. Meanwhile, 
it blocks fresh content, which 
often 
features 
more 
diverse 

perspectives and launches new 
careers, from getting produced. 
How many potential “Frozens” 
rot on Kickstarter pages because 
Disney would rather play it safe 
and recreate yet anot

More than any other studio 

in the industry, Disney boasts 
the well-padded coffers and 
clout to take bold creative risks. 
Once upon a time, Disney built 
its fortune on virtues of innova-
tion and discovery; now, it grows 
stale, greedy. If the unparalleled 
success of “Frozen” told us any-
thing, it’s that audiences crave 
new fictional worlds to get lost 
in. The droves of recent gradu-
ates flocking to Hollywood with 
original scripts prove that there’s 
no shortage of imagination to 
make that happen.

Is Disney going to take a 

chance on them? Or will they 
regret to inform you that they 
value profit over novelty and 
will randomly select from a list 
of classic Disney movies and 
famous filmmakers to decide 
their next project instead?

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
On trigger warnings

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Last week, the University’s 

Young Americans for Freedom 
chapter constructed a wall in 
the Diag that protested “Political 
Correctness: The Iron Curtain of 
the University.” It had phrases 
like “offensive,” “social justice,” 
“safe spaces” and “newspeak” 
spray-painted on them.

But the one phrase stood out 

most, in sprawling blue letters 
across the lower center of the 
wall: “Trigger Warning.”

Few other phrases on media 

platforms right now spark the 
same kind of contentious debate 
that “trigger warning” does, and 
there are intellectual leaders 
with impressive credentials on 
both ends of the spectrum. The 
debate over trigger warnings, 
which centers on the use of these 
warnings on college campuses, 
fits into a larger context of reen-
ergized interest in social justice 
and political correctness, but 
it also deserves to be separated 
from that. Unlike the pursuit of 
social justice, trigger warnings 
on syllabi could someday reach 
a consensus in University policy.

Trigger warnings in class-

rooms — preceding lectures, 
readings, films, photographs, dis-
cussions, etc. — are presented as a 
semi-formal “heads-up” that the 
material deals with sensitive sub-
ject matter that could be upset-
ting for some. Trigger warnings 
often precede content about war 
violence or sexual assault/abuse/
trauma, but they can also alert 
the reader to material includ-
ing sexism, racism, homophobia, 
self-destructive behavior or sui-
cide.

Arguments 
against 
trigger 

warnings stem from worries 
about censoring class materi-
als, coddling students, stunting 
intellectual growth and inhibit-
ing the freedoms of others. Many 
University 
professors 
believe 

that students should be exposed 
to difficult material and won’t 
grow intellectually if they don’t; 
they feel threatened that they 
could get in trouble for students 
feeling “unsafe” in their class-
rooms. Many students resent 
the usage of trigger warnings, 
claiming that the overreactions 
or sensitivities of some students 
shouldn’t hinder the intellectual 
pursuits of others.

The negative rhetoric that sur-

rounds trigger warnings over-
whelmingly constructs an image 
of the coddled college student, 
inviting ridicule on every word in 
that phrase. But trigger warnings 
aren’t about coddling students 
or protecting sensitive feelings. 
They aren’t about shielding peo-
ple from difficult material. Trig-

ger warnings themselves don’t 
constitute censorship.

To deny the utility of trigger 

warnings — especially for war 
veterans and survivors of sexual 
assault — is insulting and dismis-
sive of traumatic experiences. 
Claiming that trigger warnings 
perpetuate a culture of victim-
hood is the equivalent of say-
ing “suck it up” or “move on” 
— which isn’t psychologically 
sound advice.

My Resident Adviser put it 

well: “I feel like people are some-
times against trigger warnings 
because they feel like we can’t 
expect to be protected from the 
bad things in life. But the rea-
son trigger warnings exist is that 
some people haven’t been pro-
tected from the dark things in 
life.”

I’m in a Literature of Aboli-

tion class, and we’re studying 
“12 Years a Slave.” This film 
has graphic, violent scenes that 
include physical abuse and rape. 
My professor told all of us before-
hand that we would be watching 
it in class and that if anyone pre-
ferred to watch it by themselves 
at home rather than in a class-
room setting, we were welcome 
to do that.

She didn’t use the phrase “trig-

ger warning,” but she was effectu-
ally giving one. By giving a content 
warning and a choice in how, when 
and where we wanted to view 
this film, she was granting us the 
agency to know how we learn best. 
She wasn’t “coddling” us — she 
was giving us choices that didn’t 
impact the learning opportunities 
of our classmates.

Personally, I took advantage of 

that choice. I watched “12 Years a 
Slave” in a class setting last year, 
surrounded by people I didn’t 
know, and though I wanted to leave 
the room during the sexual assault 
and rape scenes, I was sitting in 
the front of the class — I felt like I 
didn’t want to disrupt everyone by 
getting up. But I felt emotionally 
jerked. I had trouble breathing for 
the rest of the day; I had to skip my 
next class and avoid my friends, so 
I wouldn’t worry them.

I appreciate having the option 

to watch it by myself for this class.

Yes, in the “real world” there 

are going to be times when we will 
witness things that we’d rather not 
— but you’d be hard pressed to find 
a time outside of university classes 
when you’d have to sit through an 
intense portrayal of something 
without having the option to pre-
pare or remove yourself from the 
situation if you needed. You can 
walk out of a movie theater; you 
can put down a book or exit a con-
versation.

The debate over trigger warn-

ings in the context of art in class-
rooms, where it’s being used 

explicitly as an educational tool 
to deepen our comprehensive 
understanding of a topic, is espe-
cially intriguing because artwork 
is often designed to elicit emo-
tional responses — like “12 Years 
a Slave.” But artwork isn’t simply 
an educational tool. There is a dis-
tinction to be made that is lacking 
from debates I see around trigger 
warnings preceding exposure to 
artworks.

Art can be offensive, which 

can make it controversial. But 
there should be a difference in 
how we treat controversial piec-
es of art and pieces of art that 
have the potential to be trigger-
ing though they are often both. 
In classrooms, students should 
be confronted with topics and 
discussions — and yes, artwork — 
that make them challenge them-
selves, their assumptions and 
beliefs. But no one should be con-
fronted with topics, discussions 
or artwork that could potentially 
make them feel unsafe, without 
warning. And despite popular 
opinion, it isn’t impossible to rec-
oncile these ideas.

Another aspect that’s skirted 

around in discussions about 
trigger warnings is the fact that 
intellectual growth is not the 
only kind of personal growth 
that matters in college. Using 
trigger warnings in our class-
rooms doesn’t hinder our intel-
lectual growth; it fosters our 
emotional growth. The recogni-
zance that some have had expe-
riences that others haven’t is a 
lesson in empathy and aware-
ness. By asking for trigger or 
content warnings, students are 
making concerted efforts to rec-
ognize that none of us check our 
experiences at the classroom 
door — we carry them in with us.

Even people who have expe-

rienced trauma have spoken 
against 
trigger 
warnings, 
a 

notable example being Roxane 
Gay. Trigger warnings aren’t 
a one-size-fits-all type of deal, 
and trigger warnings themselves 
don’t mean we will always feel 
safe; we can’t prepare ourselves 
for being triggered suddenly on 
the street with no preparation in 
a “real world” situation. As Gay 
points out in her book “Bad Fem-
inist,” “there is nothing words 
on the screen can do that has not 
already been done.”

I agree with this. Nothing 

preceded by the phrase “trig-
ger warning” is going to be as 
harmful as whatever happened 
that created triggers for a per-
son in the first place.

But that being said — in 

a learning community, why 
not have the option for mak-
ing choices that will make us 
feel safer when we’re trying to 
learn?

ALBUM REVIEW
‘Aquaria’ lacking

Talented BOOTS 

can’t produce a great 
standalone album

By MATT GALLATIN

For The Daily

BOOTS knows a thing or two 

about sex — his handle of synths 
and bass could make nearly any-
thing arousing. 
That is, except 
his voice.

Entering the 

public eye by 
thrilling listen-
ers 
with 
his 

contributions to 
Beyoncé’s 
viv-

idly sensual self-
titled album, BOOTS’s hedonistic 
style has made him The Weeknd 
of producers. His work on Beyon-
cé’s “Haunted,” in particular, 
acts as a climatic core for the 
BOOTS’s aesthetic, a captivating 
track which pulsates its way into 
the blood. Since then, he’s had a 
busy schedule lending his hand 
to standout releases from artists 
du jour FKA Twigs and Run the 
Jewels.

Production-wise, 
AQUARIA 

still sees BOOTS casting his 
hypnotic sound. Opening track 
“Brooklyn Gamma” leads in with 
a spinning whirl. But the first 
verse is far from enthralling, and 
the best moments come when 
BOOTS’s voice is least recogniz-
able. This pattern is all too preva-
lent throughout AQUARIA. The 
spell of BOOTS-the-producer is 
too often broken by BOOTS-the-
singer/rapper. Nowhere is this 
dichotomy more evident than 
“I Run Roulette,” an especially 
abrasive track, not because of the 
shredding bass line, but because 
his hook is nearly unbearable. At 
times you can’t help but wonder 
if he’s intentionally irritating his 
listeners. He works hard to keep 
himself “under the radar,” and he 
has a habit of putting up music on 
SoundCloud just to take it down a 
few hours later. While at first this 
seemed like a marketing ploy, the 
emergence of AQUARIA could 
signal that BOOTS actually holds 
mild disdain for his fans.

Lack of vocal talent is often 

forgivable if the artist can say 
something profound. Many rock 
band singers, if put on a scale, 
fall closer to William Hung than 
Adele. Yet most of BOOTS’s lyr-
ics are inconsequential or simply 
unnecessary, and lines like “but 
a teacher can’t teach us how to 
give a fuck” come across like an 
angsty 13-year-old’s Tumblr feed. 
 

For the most part, BOOTS’s hooks 
and ballads far outshine his “rap” 
verses. When he recognizes this, 
the result is largely successful. 
“Only,” a tender ballad that evokes 
those he produced on Beyoncé 
(“Heaven,” “Blue”), is a high point 
of the album, and signals hope for 
BOOTS’s future releases.

BOOTS’s true genius lies in his 

ability to support strong female 
voices, a niche which is applied far 
too sparsely on AQUARIA. Dera-
doorian, the sole feature, croons 
delicately on the title track in 
what is probably the best perfor-
mance you’ll find throughout all 
eleven songs. Perhaps BOOTS’s 
apprehension for guest appear-
ances comes from how ingrained 
his previous success has been 
in those collaborations. BOOTS 
would be nothing without Beyon-
cé, and he is keenly aware of this 
fact.

But in trying to break away 

from this dependence, he ignores 
his strengths. His most recent 
Beyoncé collaboration, the “Crazy 
in Love (Remix)” for the “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” soundtrack, is 
infinitely more evocative of the 
“BOOTS” aesthetic than BOOTS’s 
own release. The hallmarks of his 
production soak through: a slow 
building piano base, subtle back-
ground clicks, and an explosive, 
aching chorus. Whereas BOOTS’s 

vocals diminish his tracks, Beyon-
cé’s gorgeous, breathy singing 
can tackle the production and 
demands attention. His collabo-
ration with FKA Twigs followed 
a 
similar 
formula. 
“Mother-

creep” fluttered and lurched with 
Twig’s high-pitched vocals, and 
the desirous atmosphere mate-
rialized clearly. These are tracks 
that you can feel. There is little 
on AQUARIA which has the same 
power. The songs are holding 
back, perhaps to accommodate 
the limitations of BOOTS singing, 
and the result is a rather detached 
album.

Still, AQUARIA is an improve-

ment from BOOTS’s first solo 
release. 
WinterSpringSummer-

Fall was far more cluttered and 
included lyrical gems like “pussy 
tastes like apple juice, baby that’s 
a juice box.” While AQUARIA 
is by no means poetry, it avoids 
confusing lyricism and manages 
to focus itself, a cautious sign that 
BOOTS can learn from his own 
shortcomings. You can’t help but 
wish, though, that BOOTS would 
follow the lead of producers like 
Arca, Burial and Jamie xx, all of 
whom have demonstrated the 
power that electronic tracks can 
hold without reliance on vocals.

AQUARIA is better as a remind-

er of BOOTS’s relevance rather 
than as a stand-alone album. He 
doesn’t yet have a handle on the 
solo album, but that doesn’t mean 
that his skill behind the boards is 
in any way diminished. There are 
plenty of artists that are itching 
to use this enormously popular 
sound, and a single, well-calcu-
lated collaboration could be much 
more effective than the entirety of 
AQUARIA.

In defense of 

pampering yourself
L

ast week I found myself 
in a bad bout of anxiety 
and took an uncharac-

teristic course of action when I 
consulted my mom. Mind you, 
my mother 
is an inde-
cipherable, 
partially 
detached 
proponent 
of tough 
love. Case 
in point: she 
has spent 
the entirety 
of my 
19.5 years 
attempting to convince me 
that “true love is a ruse” and 
if I don’t believe her I can “try 
and find it” only after I “get 
my degree.” So, naturally, 
with an irrepressible case of 
uneasiness, I took a chance 
and attempted a heart-to-heart 
with my mom via text.

I don’t remember the specif-

ics of my rant, but imagine it 
was something melodramatic 
and existential along the lines 
of: “What am I doing with my 
life? Why am I here? How’s the 
dog?”

Though I can’t say I found the 

answers I craved in a moment 
of desperation, my mother 
replied as follows (convenient-
ly, I did screenshot and save 
her exact response):

“Is there a salon where you 

could get a blow dry, mani-
cure/pedicure ... It’s nice to 
always have your grooming! - 
Mom”

In that moment I learned 

an unequivocal fact of life — 
sometimes when all you need 
is a validating “pish posh, 
Caro, you’re smart, funny, 
stylish and beautiful,” you get 
an unexpected “It’s nice to 
always have your grooming!”

At face value, her advice 

seemed superficial and insen-
sitive, 
but 
after 
consider-

ing 
my 
youth-through-teen 

years punctuated by beauty 

rituals that always lifted my 
spirits and soothed my soul, I 
knew she was onto something 
between the curt lines. Invest-
ing in oneself was, and always 
had been a tenet of her unorth-
odox parenting that I believed 
in (though I’ve yet to yield to 
her case against true love). 
Moreover, it wasn’t merely her 
unfettered belief in self-pam-
pering, but her championing 
of taking breaks — alternating 
increments of hard work with 
something enjoyable — a wise 
morsel of advice that’s easier 
said than done in college when 
the funds and low and the 
work is all-consuming.

For some, it’s the sporadic 

jaunt 
to 
BuzzFeed 
during 

lecture to find themselves via 
trash quizzes, or my friend and 
her weekly splurge on high tea 
at TeaHaus. For me, it tends 
to oscillate between sprucing 
up the integumentary — a 
blow out or a mani/pedi — a 
kneading of the lumbar or 
a cosmetic application. But 
alas, after a indulging in my 
own 
brand 
of 
fulfillment, 

there’s bound to be flack from 
third-party naysayers. Some 
version of “your lifestyle is too 
particular, Caro” or “you’re 
horribly self-indulgent, Caro” 
inevitably arises.

I can see the case for 

frivolity, 
or 
the 
disgust 

for perceivably giving into 
beauty standards, but neither 
argument is valid. Sure, I love 
the high of getting made up, 
but it’s never for vanity, nor 
intended to impress the male 
population — it’s always about 
looking and feeling good for 
myself. In the most reductive 
sense, I aim to carve out time 
each week for a refrain from 
the draining minutia, and who 
doesn’t need that?

Whether on a fixed sched-

ule or executed impulsively, I 
have and always will believe 
in the necessary retreat from 
the 
day-to-day. 
Since 
my 

youth (read: when I had fewer 
problems and more outlets), I 
quickly recognized the reme-
dial and restorative qualities 
of my mom’s case for occa-
sional self-indulgence; I saw it 
as the cure-all for everything 
from melancholia to mild dis-
satisfaction.

After considering mother’s 

text 
message 
that 
day, 
I 

instantly reflected on the rare 
moments of clarity in salon 
chairs, or the mental repose 
only available post-massage. 
Suddenly, my freak-out made 
sense. I realized my self-care 
had fallen to the wayside, lost 
in a pile of study guides and 
history readings. I craved the 
endorphins and heightened 
spirit that only my particular 
religious methods could bring.

The 
next 
morning, 
in 

efforts to restore my long-lost 
rationale, I opted for a dual-
focused day of indulgence and 
scheduled a pedicure followed 
by 
a 
deep-tissue 
massage. 

Walking back to my apartment 
in a happy post-pleasure haze 
without a single callus, kink or 
knot, I was absolutely certain 
it was the best decision for my 
physical and mental health.

Despite 
my 
moment 
of 

weakness, I do indeed enjoy 
living. Ideally, I strive for 
balance; I strive to maximize 
my 
human 
experience 
by 

alternating 
responsibilities 

with 
pleasure 
— 
so 
the 

utterly 
blissful 
moments 

hold 
some 
well-deserved 

weight. 
Apparently, 
some 

find inspiration in my simple 
philosophy and its noticeable 
benefits — a family friend even 
regards me as a “zen ideal.” 
However, I can only maintain 
personal equilibrium if I follow 
mom’s 
infallible 
lead 
and 

prioritize pampering.

MY FIRST FAVORITE ALBUM
My true ‘Love’

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Over the course of my nearly 20 

years as a music listener (my dad 
consistently played music through-
out mine and my sister’s infancies), 
I have experienced a blossom-
ing love for Alecia Moore, better 
known as her stage name P!NK.

Our flirtation began when she 

taught me my first swear word: 
“ass.” I was in kindergarten and 
my sister had been doing that typi-
cal older sibling “you’re too young 
for this” bullshit while listening to 
P!NK’s sophomore record Missun-
daztood.

“There’s a bad word you can’t 

hear. It’s another word for butt,” 
she said. Hm. Another word for butt. 
My five-year-old brain couldn’t 
come up with any possibilities — I 
couldn’t guess the word “ass” with-
out actually knowing it. Obviously, 
I took the typical younger sibling 
response and went downstairs as 
her and her friends elementary-
school jammed to “Get the Party 
Started,” and the instant I heard 
the lyric “I’ll be burnin’ rubber, 
you’ll be kissin’ my ass” I knew my 
first swear word. I had certainly 
heard the word before seeing that 
my parents couldn’t conceivably 
go five years without saying the 
A-word in front of me.

Our next significant encounter 

was Dec. 25, 2003. I was in second 
grade and P!NK’s third album Try 
This dropped the month prior and 
“Trouble” was my jam. On that 
white, shimmery morning in BFE, 
Ohio I popped the CD into my por-
table player and went off. Admit-
tedly, I did only listen to the first 
three songs up until a few years 
ago, but in my defense I loved those 
three songs so much, my thought 
was “Why bother with the rest of 
it when I already know I like these 
songs?” Yes, I realize that is musi-
cal terrorism and I deeply regret it 
because the rest of the album is just 
as much fun.

Despite my affection for her 

work up until my 17th year of life, 
my devotion to P!NK’s work mul-
tiplied endlessly with the release 
of her sixth album, my first (and 
all-time) favorite album, The Truth 
About Love.

Up until its release I didn’t con-

sider myself one to listen to entire 
albums. I liked songs, I liked art-
ists. Typically, I would just pluck 
a few tracks from my favorite art-
ists across the board, rarely diving 
deep into a record or any particu-
lar discography, a far cry from my 
musical self today — someone who 
listens almost entirely to complete 
albums, through and through. 
I have The Truth About Love to 
thank for that. I went from buying 
a single song, “Blow Me (One Last 
Kiss)” to taking the leap and pre-
ordering the entire album based on 
my liking of the tracklist. What fol-
lowed was 20 songs, bonus tracks 
included that changed my relation-
ship with music. Know that I’m not 
exaggerating when I say The Truth 
About Love was my go-to listen for 
upwards of a year (and I still listen 
to it at least once a week). 

Like any album about love, it’s 

an album about life. My life. Maybe 
your life. I’ve screamed the lyrics 
of “Slut Like You” and “Walk of 
Shame” in an empty house, many 
times. “Blow Me (One Last Kiss)” 
serves as a fuck you anthem when 
needed. “Are We All We Are” and 
“How Come You’re Not Here” are 
as fun as they are therapeutic. On 
love’s flipside, ‘Beam Me Up” and 
“The Great Escape” are minimally 
and beautifully showcasing not 
only P!NK’s vocal prowess, but also 
the seriousness of her artistry. Col-
labs with Eminem, Lily Rose Coo-
per (formerly Lily Allen) and Nate 
Ruess take the album’s talent over 
the top, leaving seven equally spec-
tacular bonus tracks to cover any 
overlooked truths about love.

The Truth About Love is one to 

lose your voice to. It’s the one I lose 
my voice to.

What to Watch For:
Michigan at PSU

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

With its conference title hopes 

on the line, the No. 12 Michigan 
football team can’t afford to look 
ahead when it visits Penn State on 
Saturday.

A win in Happy Valley could 

set up a potential Big Ten 
Championship 
Game 
play-in 

between the Wolverines and 
Buckeyes in a week. But a winner-
take-all matchup is impossible 
if Michigan doesn’t take care of 
business this weekend.

Here’s what to watch for when 

Michigan visits Penn State.

1. Can the defense regain its 

form?

After losing redshirt junior 

defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
to an injured pectoral muscle, the 
Wolverines suffered the ill effects 
of exhaustion against Indiana. 
The Hoosiers’ quick tempo wore 
down the Michigan defense, 
allowing Indiana running back 
Jordan Howard to run wild.

The Hoosiers poured on 41 

points, the most of any Wolverine 
opponent this season, drawing up 
a blueprint for Michigan’s future 
opponents to follow. The question 
is whether the Nittany Lions can 
learn from Indiana’s success and 
execute effectively.

Penn State has a talented 

running back in Saquon Barkley, 
and a quarterback capable of 
making just about any throw in 
Christian Hackenberg. But the 
Nittany Lions’ offensive line is 
nowhere near the level of the 
Hoosiers’, and most of Indiana’s 
success was conditional on solid 
blocking.

But if Penn State can get good 

protection, the Wolverines could 
be in trouble once more.

2. Two top-notch D-lines

Even 
without 
Glasgow, 

Michigan is talented up front. 
Redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Willie Henry and redshirt junior 
defensive end Chris Wormley 
have been consistent forces in the 
backfield, and redshirt sophomore 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst 
has had a breakout season.

But the Nittany Lions might 

be every bit as good, highlighted 
by the nation’s sack leader, 
Carl Nassib, who has 15.5. The 
Wolverines have faced a trio 
of tough fronts this season 
in Utah, Michigan State and 
Northwestern, but they have yet 
to take on a player who can change 
the game as much as Nassib.

3. Will Jake Rudock continue 

his hot streak?

Michigan’s fifth-year senior 

quarterback is, as the kids say, en 
fuego. Rudock has earned back-
to-back career highs in passing 
yards in his last two games, 
culminating with a 440-yard, 
six-touchdown 
effort 
against 

Indiana.

But Penn State is among the 

nation’s 
best 
pass 
defenses, 

allowing just 159 yards per game 
through the air. The Wolverines’ 
receiving corps of junior tight 
end Jake Butt and redshirt junior 
receivers Amara Darboh and 
Jehu Chesson is in a rhythm of 
late — especially Chesson, who 
caught four touchdowns last 
week — and they’ll need to keep 
it up if Michigan is going to have 

success Saturday.

4. The out-of-town scoreboard

If Michigan does come away 

with a win Saturday, all eyes will 
be on the scores elsewhere in the 
country.

If 
Ohio 
State 
can 
beat 

Michigan State in Columbus, 
the Wolverines and Buckeyes 
will play for a spot in the Big Ten 
title game next Saturday. That’s 
the most important result the 
Wolverines will be watching for. 
But if that happens, many other 
games gain importance too.

Sitting at No. 12 in the 

College 
Football 
Playoff 

rankings, 
Michigan 
is 
not 

completely out of the playoff 
picture — it just needs a lot to 
go right to get there. This week, 
the Wolverines would hope for 
wins from the Buckeyes over 
the Spartans, Iowa over Purdue 
and USC over Oregon. That 
would keep Michigan’s next 
opponent undefeated, and keep 
alive the possibility it could face 
an undefeated Iowa team in the 
Big Ten title game.

The 
Trojans, 
meanwhile, 

could play a crucial role in the 
Wolverines’ 
championship 

hopes. If USC wins out, it will go 
to the Pac-12 title game, where 
it could emerge as a three-loss 
conference champion, unlikely 
to pass Michigan in the rankings 
if the Wolverines win the Big 
Ten.

If that happens, any Notre 

Dame loss — either to Boston 
College or Stanford — would 
swing the door wide open.

Of course, Michigan needs to 

worry about its own scoreboard 
first.

FOOTBALL

Dream season to be 
tested at Penn State

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

In many ways, the No. 12 

Michigan football team’s season 
has already been something of a 
dream to Michigan fans.

The 
Wolverines 
have 
a 

surprising 
eight 
wins, 

their 
only 

two 
losses 

have come in 
nightmarish 
fashion, 
and 

every up and 
down has been 
sandwiched 
by 
Michigan 

coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh’s 
odd 
quotes 

about machine 
gun-laden 
worms, 
steak vitamins and Pattengill 
pickup basketball games. The 
first 11 weeks were as wild as 
they were unexpected, and the 
unseasonably warm fall is icing 
on the cake.

Of course, the biggest dreams 

of all are still in play. As Michigan 
(5-1 Big Ten, 8-2 overall) travels 
to State College to take on Penn 
State on Saturday, it has a chance 
to get one step closer to a Big Ten 
Championship.

With a goal to play for, the 

Wolverines aren’t trudging to the 
season’s end — they’re bouncing.

“When you’re winning, you’re 

able to keep a bounce in your step,” 
said fifth-year senior offensive 
lineman Graham Glasgow. “You 
want to keep it rolling, so I think it 
just comes down to, do we want to 
win? Yes, we want to win, so keep 
the bounce and the little nicks and 

bruises you have, get ’em right and 
let’s play.”

Though 
Michigan 
is 
the 

favorite to win and keep its 
dreams alive, the Nittany Lions 
(4-2, 7-3) are a stout opponent, and 
the two teams have a precedent 
for making things interesting.

Last season, Michigan eked by 

Penn State, 18-13, in a come-from-
behind win. In 2013, it was Penn 
State that battled back at home, 
scoring 10 points in the final six 
minutes to tie before outlasting 
the Wolverines in triple overtime, 
43-40.

This season, both teams are 

improved, but many of the players 
from past years remain on the 
roster, understanding the battle 
that Saturday can become.

“Penn 
State 
presents 
a 

big challenge, and our team 
will be prepared for it this 
week,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Jim 
Harbaugh. 
“Outstanding 

defense. Offensively, outstanding 
quarterback, 
outstanding 

running back, receivers that are 
outstanding, so … formidable task, 
and it is a road game.”

Harbaugh has said throughout 

the season that the key to winning 
road games is to “pack your 
defense,” and that might be what 
both teams do best.

Michigan 
and 
Penn 
State 

have used defense to stay in 
every game. The Wolverines are 
currently second in the nation in 
total defense, while the Nittany 
Lions are 13th.

Both 
teams 
boast 
similar 

styles, using a bruising front and 
attentive secondary to make even 
the best quarterbacks miserable 
and force the run. Michigan and 
Penn State boast the nation’s 
second- 
and 
11th-best 
pass 

efficiency defenses, respectively.

On the other side of the ball, 

quarterback 
play 
could 
very 

well become a deciding factor in 
Happy Valley. Fifth-year senior 
Jake Rudock has played as well as 
any quarterback in the country in 
the last two weeks — throwing for 
777 yards and eight touchdowns 
against Rutgers and Indiana — but 
has shriveled against strong pass 
defenses like Utah and Michigan 
State.

Nittany 
Lion 
quarterback 

Christian 
Hackenberg, 
once 

touted by many as a potential first-
round draft pick, has shriveled 
against just about everyone this 
season. His interceptions are 
down, but he has topped 300 
yards only once all season and is 
11th in the Big Ten in QBR.

The fact remains, however, 

that Michigan has given up big 
plays in recent weeks, and the 
big-armed 
Hackenberg 
can 

give any daydreaming defender 
nightmares.

“We are looking forward to 

rushing the passer,” said senior 
defensive end Royce Jenkins-
Stone. “We are looking forward to 
rushing Hackenberg, disrupting 
his timing and getting inside his 
head.

“When you have someone 

that’s an NFL prospect, it’s kind 
of like ‘Oh, okay, I gotta get after 
him.’ (NFL scouts) are watching 
him, so they’re watching me now, 
so I’ve got to find a way to get in 
the spotlight just like him.”

Before you pinch yourself to 

see if you’re dreaming, realize 
that you are not. Michigan has 
the ability to win the Big Ten 
Championship and beyond, but 
the road to the championship 
runs through State College.

Wolverines dominate Xavier

By CHRIS CROWDER

Madison Ristovski jumped in 

front of a driving Xavier guard, 
put her hands up, set her feet and 
took the charge. The Michigan 
bench was ignited, rising to its 
feet before the referee could even 
corral the basketball.

team outplayed the Musketeers in 
nearly every facet of the game to 
the tune of a 92-54 win.

“They were just scrapping 

and clawing all over the place,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “They were looking to take 
charges, dive on the floor for loose 
balls — they just set the tone the 
first half of the game. Everybody 
that rotated into the game gave us 
great minutes.”

The Wolverines (3-0) began the 

contest by utilizing their guards’ 
ability to penetrate the perimeter 
defense. Just when a Xavier 
player bit on the pump fake for 
the shot, the guards fed the ball 
to freshman center Hallie Thome, 
who scored Michigan’s first six 
points.

Midway 
through 
the 
first 

quarter, the Wolverines began 
implementing a zone defense, 
trapping the Musketeer point 
guard just before she reached 
half court. The defensive pressure 
forced turnovers, while the hustle 
to dive for loose balls and to 
disrupt passing lanes was evident 
from tip-off. By the end of the first 
quarter, Michigan boasted a 10-5 
rebound advantage, with three 
of those boards coming on the 
offensive glass.

“More rebounds for us mean 

less offensive chances for the 
other team,” said sophomore 
forward Jillian Dunston. “It gives 
us more possessions, and we kind 
of value our possessions through 
rebounds. … (Rebounds) are our 
bread and butter.”

Ristovski capped off the first 

quarter with a buzzer-beater 
3-pointer to give the Wolverines 
a 25-14 lead. The next 3-pointer 
the senior guard knocked down 
ignited an 8-0 run in the second 
quarter, causing Xavier to take a 
timeout after a reverse finger-roll 
by sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty. The Michigan bench 
jumped up as those on the floor 
neared the sideline, showing 
as much energy as it did when 
Ristovski took a charge in the 
game’s opening minutes.

By the time Ristovski drained 

her third triple of the contest, the 

Musketeers were in a nearly five-
minute scoring drought. Xavier 
quickly found itself down by 23, 
and continued to be outworked 
on the glass and for every ball that 
was up for grabs.

Michigan led 49-20 at the half, 

holding the Musketeers to just 
six points in the second quarter. 
The 
Wolverines 
shot 
7-for-9 

from behind the arc — their best 
shooting half of the young season. 
They shot 57 percent from the 
floor, nearly double Xavier’s 29 
percent. Flaherty led all scorers 
with 14 points at the halftime 
break.

“Coming out of that half, 

(Barnes Arico) said (the first half) 
was one of the best halves she’s 
been a part of here at Michigan,” 
Flaherty said. “That gave us a 
lot of confidence. And I think it 
showed us that we can play that 
well and that hard.”

Michigan also had the upper 

hand on the boards, racking up 
15 more rebounds than Xavier. 
Dunston had eight rebounds 
in the first half — the same 
number as all of the Musketeers 
combined. With 5:25 left to go 
in the third quarter, Dunston 
picked up her first career double-
double as she reached 10 points 
and 11 rebounds.

Meanwhile, Xavier’s leading 

scorer, guard Raeshaun Gaffney 
was 
held 
quiet 
throughout. 

Gaffney, who scored 18 points in 
her last game, mustered just four 
points in the first half. She didn’t 
record her first field goal until just 
4:12 remained in the third quarter.

Dunston finished with 10 points 

and 14 rebounds, while Flaherty 
finished with 19. The Wolverines 
didn’t let their opponent get 
anywhere close in the victory.

“(Gaffney) took 21 shots for 

them the other night,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She didn’t have an 
opportunity for 21 shots tonight. 
We did a really great job. Siera 
Thompson 
did 
a 
great 
job 

defending her, and everybody else 
did a good job of helping out on 
her.”

Michigan faced its toughest 

competition to date Thursday 
night, but controlled the game 
as easily as it did in its first two 
contests. The Wolverines will 
continue to be tested as the 
competition stiffens, and for now, 
they have continued to outwork 
their competition.

“We always say, and we write 

in the locker room before the 
game, you can’t be the hardest-
working team in America unless 
you’re willing to do this, this and 
this,” Barnes Arico said. “Tonight, 
they came out and showed that 
they were willing to do all of those 
things to be considered as one 
of the hardest-working teams in 
America.”

Dunston shines 
in first-ever start

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

Toward the beginning of the 

week, Jillian Dunston had a 
feeling that she would be in the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team’s starting lineup Thursday 
night.

But even though the sophomore 

forward was being put in the top-
five rotation during practice, she 
knew nothing was for certain when 
playing for coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. She was going to have to 
fight for the spot, especially when 
it was between her, senior forward 
Kelsey Mitchell and senior guard 
Madison Ristovski. 

So 
before 
the 
Wolverines 

took on Xavier Thursday night, 
Dunston saw her name on the 
board before the game started and 
knew her time had come.

She wasn’t even nervous.
“If I’m nervous, I get out of 

my game,” Dunston said. “I told 
myself not to think about it, just 
like any other game. I’m just 
starting this time.”

But it wasn’t like any other 

game. Dunston grabbed a career-
high 14 rebounds and tied her 
career high in scoring (10) for her 
first double-double in the maize 
and blue — Michigan’s first this 
season. In arguably the best game 
of her career, Dunston helped the 
Wolverines (3-0) to a 92-54 win 
over the Musketeers.

Dunston helped to anchor the 

defense by grabbing 11 rebounds 
and tallying three steals, including 
one when she broke up a pass at half 
court and took the ball straight to 
the basket for a layup. Leading by 
example, the rest of the Wolverines 
followed suit and forced seven 
turnovers in the second quarter, 
using the momentum to go on a 
13-0 run. Dunston also set the 
pace of Michigan’s fast break and 
helped create a few second-chance 
opportunities under the basket.

In some respect, she had started 

to look like former Michigan 
forward Cyesha Goree in disguise. 

“With the loss of Cyesha, we 

lost that motor,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Jillian is definitely one of a couple 
that have given us that spark.”

That spark started to ignite 

when Dunston stayed for the 
team’s optional spring season 
early in the summer, allowing her 
to step her game up to an entirely 
new level.

Recently, Barnes Arico asked 

Dunston how much she works 
out. Every day, Dunston replied. 
Barnes Arico mistook that for an 
exaggeration, but Dunston meant 
every word. After Thursday’s 
win, Barnes Arico said Dunston 
might have been in the gym that 
afternoon getting extra repetitions 
in, even before a game.

Though 
Dunston 
beat 
out 

Mitchell and Ristovski for the 
fifth starting spot, Barnes Arico 
emphasized 
that 
the 
senior 

pair has played exceptionally at 
practice. According to her, the 
problem is that, “It’s hard to keep 
(Dunston) out of the lineup.”

“I think that’s really Jill’s game, 

and that’s only a little of what she 
can do,” said sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty. 

Dunston knows how to score 

and rebound the basketball well, 
and she has also learned how to 
beat the fatigue that comes with 
a performance like Thursday’s, 
when she played a career-high 27 
minutes. After a quick succession 
of possession changes, Barnes 
Arico 
noticed 
Dunston 
had 

stopped crashing the net as often. 
When she came off the court to 
rest, she said she wasn’t tired.

“She is probably one of our 

fastest, if not the fastest (player on 
the team),” Barnes Arico said. 

Added Dunston: “I kind of got 

tired, but tired is a state of mind.”

It’s that attitude that pushed 

Dunston to make every minute of 
her first start matter — an attitude 
that may keep her in the starting 
rotation for Sunday’s game against 
Hartford.

For a short time, though, 

Dunston can celebrate her hard 
work paying off. Thursday night 
was all hers.

Breakdown: Michigan at Penn State

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Only one item remains on the 

Michigan football team’s to-do 
list before the Wolverines have 
a chance to face No. 3 Ohio State 
at home for a spot in the Big Ten 
Championship.

This weekend, No. 12 Michigan 

must journey into Happy Valley 
and come away with a win over 
Penn State (4-2 Big Ten, 7-3 
overall) — no small task.

The two teams have played close 

games in their last two matchups: 
In 2013, the Nittany Lions pulled 
out a 43-40, double-overtime win, 
and last season Michigan held 
off Penn State under the lights at 
Michigan Stadium, 18-13.

With the way the Wolverines 

have played lately — three of their 
past four games have gone down 
to the final play — more theatrics 
aren’t out of the question.

The Daily breaks down the 

matchup:

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Penn State pass defense

Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock is coming 
off the best game of his career, 
and it couldn’t have happened at a 
better time. The Wolverines may 
need some more heroics from him 
in the last two weeks of the season. 
He appears ready to provide those 
heroics, with the help of redshirt 
junior wide receivers Jehu Chesson 
and Amara Darboh and junior tight 
end Jake Butt.

Michigan played it relatively 

safe last year against Penn State, 
with quarterback Devin Gardner 
finishing 16-for-24 with 192 yards, 
a touchdown and an interception. 
That was about Rudock’s average 
until 
last 
week, 
when 
the 

Wolverines started hitting passes 
downfield. If that trend continues, 
it also bodes well for what could be 
a shootout against Ohio State next 
week.

The problem for Michigan is 

that the Nittany Lions could be the 
best opposing pass defense of the 
season. Penn State gives up just 
159 yards per game through the 
air — second in the nation — and 
has nine interceptions. Indiana, 
meanwhile, 
came 
into 
last 

weekend’s game ranked second to 
last in that category.

The Nittany Lions’ leader in 

pass breakups has just five of them, 
but most of the team’s success in 
defending the aerial attack comes 
in its pass rush. Penn State has 
41 sacks this season, led by the 
nation’s leader in the category: 
defensive end Carl Nassib with 
15.5.

Edge: Penn State

Michigan rush offense vs. 

Penn State rush defense

The Wolverines have dropped 

off in their running game lately. 
In their five-game winning streak 
earlier in the season, they rushed 
for more than 200 yards four 
times, but they haven’t done so in 
the four games since. Last week at 
Indiana, Rudock was their leading 
rusher with 64 yards, while junior 
running back De’Veon Smith 
gained just 58 on 12 carries.

Due 
to 
a 
combination 
of 

injuries, splitting carries and 
ineffectiveness, Michigan hasn’t 
had a 100-yard rusher since Smith 
against Brigham Young on Sept. 
26. The Wolverines relied more on 
the passing game against Indiana, 
but if they could establish the 
ground game early, it might help 
relieve the pressure on Rudock.

That will be no easy task against 

Nassib and the Penn State front. 
The Nittany Lions have 94 tackles 
for loss this season, including a 
streak of 18 games with at least 
five. Overall, Penn State’s defense 
ranks No. 13 in the country, giving 
Michigan a tough test.

Edge: Penn State

Penn State pass offense vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Penn 
State 
quarterback 

Christian Hackenberg has already 
faced the Wolverines twice, with 
mixed results. Two years ago in 
State College, he threw for 305 
yards and three touchdowns, 
including one to lead a comeback 
at the end of regulation. Last 
season in Ann Arbor, Michigan 
sacked him six times and limited 
him to just 160 yards.

Hackenberg, 
a 
6-foot-4, 

228-pound junior, has thrown 
13 touchdowns and just three 
interceptions this season. His 
top 
target 
is 
wide 
receiver 

Chris Godwin (808 yards, three 
touchdowns). But his offensive 
line is still struggling, giving up 
33 sacks in 10 games this season, 
so Michigan has an opportunity 
there.

The Wolverines appear to have 

solved some of their issues in the 
secondary, allowing just 317 yards 
over the past two weeks after 
surrendering at least that many in 
each of the previous two games. 
Hackenberg has the tools to burn 
them, but the secondary will be 
the best he has faced this season.

Edge: Michigan

Penn State rush offense vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Here, the Wolverines have the 

most to prove. Playing without 
redshirt junior defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow at Indiana last 
week, Michigan allowed 307 yards 
rushing on 55 attempts.

The Wolverines had to move 

up redshirt sophomore Maurice 
Hurst to play in Glasgow’s spot, 
and they faced depth issues 
behind Hurst. Redshirt junior 
defensive lineman Tom Strobel, 
now a two-way player, will see 
action there, as will others. Even 
without Glasgow, Michigan still 
boasts redshirt junior defensive 

linemen Willie Henry and Chris 
Wormley.

Penn State’s rushing attack 

doesn’t quite have the firepower 
of Indiana’s, and the Nittany 
Lions won’t test Michigan with 
any up-tempo offense, either. But 
running back Saquon Barkley is 
earning 6.3 yards per carry for 
a total of 836 along with seven 
touchdowns. There isn’t much 
behind him, and the sacks hurt 
Penn State’s rushing numbers. 
While the Nittany Lions rank 
just 98th in the country, the 
Wolverines will have to prove they 
can stop the run.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

The Wolverines gave up another 

big play in the special teams game 
last week, this time a punt-return 
touchdown by Indiana’s Mitchell 

Paige. Other than that, though, the 
unit remains solid. Senior kicker 
Kenny Allen is now 14-for-18 on 
field goals, and fifth-year senior 
punter Blake O’Neill is averaging 
41.7 yards on 44 punts with just 
three touchbacks.

Penn State changed kickers 

midseason, from Joey Julius to 
Tyler Davis after Julius missed 
two extra points against Illinois 
on Oct. 31. Davis has been perfect 
since then.

The Nittany Lions also have 

two punters and no big-play threat 
in the return game like Michigan 
redshirt freshman Jabrill Peppers.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

In some ways, Penn State has 

the edge here. The Nittany Lions 
are coming off a late-season bye 
week, playing at home on Senior 

Day and looking to avenge last 
season’s loss in Ann Arbor. 
Meanwhile, Michigan admitted 
to being fatigued at Indiana last 
week, will be playing without 
Glasgow again and is traveling 
on the road for the second 
straight game.

But 
then 
there 
are 
the 

circumstances: Penn State is 
all but eliminated from the 
Big Ten East race, save for the 
possibility of a wild end to the 
season that could result in a 
four-way tie. The Wolverines, 
on the other hand, need only a 
win and a Michigan State loss to 
play their archrival at home for 
the division title next week. For 
them, the stakes couldn’t be any 
bigger.

Edge: Michigan

‘M’ faces tough weekend

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

A year ago, the Michigan 

hockey team traveled to Boston 
University to take on the Terriers 
at the loud and rowdy Agganis 
Arena.

Though 
the 

Wolverines (5-1-
1) held an early 
lead, sparked by 
then-freshman 
defenseman 
Zach Werenski’s 
opening 
goal, 

they 
couldn’t 

fend off Boston 
University’s 
attack, 
giving 

up a score to 
forward 
Jack 

Eichel early in 
the third period and conceding 
the game-winner with just two 
minutes left in the game.

Thirteen months later, No. 12 

Michigan will travel back to face 
the 10th-ranked Terriers — an 
NCAA Finalist last season. 

Except this time, things aren’t 

exactly the same.

Between the two teams, a 

total of six players — including 
the 
Wolverines’ 
and 
Boston 

University’s top three and top two 
scorers from last year, respectively 
— have moved on to professional 
leagues.

But just because some of the 

talent is gone doesn’t mean the 
game is any less important.

The Terriers (5-3-2) present 

Michigan with its first real test 
of the season and will be the first 
top-10 team the Wolverines will 
face.

The Wolverines know that, and 

they’re bracing for the step up in 
competition.

“Intensity’s been pretty high,” 

said senior forward Boo Nieves. 

Last week, Michigan coasted 

to a 7-3 victory over Niagara that 

featured six different goal scorers. 
But despite the big win, Michigan 
coach Red Berenson was still 
disappointed with the three goals 
allowed and stressed that point 
throughout practice during the 
week.

“We need to make sure we’re 

taking care of things in our own 
end first,” Nieves said. “(Berenson) 
was happy that we had seven 
goals, but he also wasn’t too happy 
that we gave up three, and two 
of those goals were special-team 
goals that shouldn’t have gone in. “

On the other side of the ice, 

the Terriers come into the game 
without having lost in the last 
three weeks. In that span, they 
beat Northeastern twice and 
tied No. 1 Providence twice in a 
rematch of last season’s NCAA 
Championship game.

And while Eichel isn’t around 

to light the lamp anymore, Boston 
University still has loads of talent.

“When you go play (Boston 

University) with Jack Eichel, you 
always know when Jack Eichel is 
out there,” Werenski said. “This 
year, without him, it definitely 
crosses your mind that he isn’t out 
there. But they have freshmen like 
(forwards Jordan Greenway and 
Charlie McAvoy), who I played 
with at (the USA Hockey National 
Team Development Program) and 
are really good players.”

On the blue line, All-American 

defenseman Matt Grezlcyk and 
the rest of the defense will try to 
stop a Wolverine offense that is 
currently ranked second in the 
nation in goals per game.

In 
between 
the 
pipes, 

Boston University will trot out 
netminder Connor LaCouvee. The 
sophomore goaltender is taking 
over for 2014-2015 Hockey East 
Second Team goaltender Matt 
O’Connor, who is also now in the 
professional ranks.

But even without Eichel at the 

opposite end of the ice, Michigan 
knows it can’t worry too much 
about the Terriers. The Wolverines 
need to worry about themselves.

 “At the same time, who knows, 

they could be even better without 
him,” Nieves said.” It really 
doesn’t matter about them. It’s 
more about us.”

Xavier presents a new 
challenge for Michigan

Wolverines will 
look to eliminate 
inconsistencies of 

early season

By LEV FACHER 

Managing Editor

John 
Beilein, 
typically 

straight-laced, took a turn for 
the philosophical on Thursday. 
In the leadup to the No. 24 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
Friday-night clash with Xavier, 
he referenced a Muhammad Ali 
quote he felt 
represented 
his 
team’s 

early-season 
development:

It isn’t the 

mountains 
ahead to climb 
that wear you 
out, it’s the 
pebble in your 
shoe.

The pebble, 

Beilein 
said 

Thursday, 
is 
random 

inconsistency 
in games and in practice. Even 
if four players are crashing the 
boards for an offensive rebound, 
for example, there always seems 
to be one standing and watching.

“Or there’s one that doesn’t call 

out a screen,” Beilein said. “These 
are small things … we’ve got to 
get that pebble out of our shoe, 
because it’ll be hard to go where 
we want to as long as those things 
are lingering.”

More annoying to Beilein is 

the fact that there’s no single 
culprit — it’s a seemingly random 
rotation of players suffering from 
momentary mental lapses.

As 
Michigan’s 
season 

progresses, Beilein’s need to trim 
his 12-man rotation is becoming 
more pressing, and it’s the 
minutiae, in games or in practice, 
that could make the difference in 

what he says are “dead heats” at 
several positions.

For 
now, 
though, 
the 

undefined rotation might serve 
as an advantage. The Wolverines 
(2-0) have used four players 
— redshirt sophomore Mark 
Donnal, sophomore Ricky Doyle, 
redshirt freshman D.J. Wilson 
and freshman Moritz Wagner — 
at the ‘5’ spot, and all five might 
be needed against the Musketeers 
(2-0).

Xavier’s Jalen Reynolds, a 

Detroit native, is the biggest low-
post 
threat 

Michigan 
has 

faced so far, and 
a by-committee 
approach 
from the big 
men might be 
needed to stop 
him.

“Well, 
we 

have 
fouls 

to give there 
now,” 
Beilein 

said, noting that he’ll have no 
choice but to use all four players 
despite his desire to slim down 
the Wolverines’ rotation. “We’ll 
have to. That is just a very strong, 
experienced player, good athlete, 
(who’s) really going to be tough 
for any of our guys to defend.”

Though none of Michigan’s 

big men has more than a season 
of NCAA competition under his 
belt, Beilein said the concern 
with 
Reynolds 
goes 
beyond 

experience. 
It 
took 
former 

Michigan 
forward 
Jordan 

Morgan five years to become an 
‘elite defender,’ Beilein said, and 
even he would have his hands 
full against Reynolds.

It’s not just the low post 

that could give the Wolverines 
trouble. Michigan’s coaching 
staff 
has 
encouraged 
its 

shooters, 
including 
junior 

guard 
Derrick 
Walton 
Jr., 

senior guard Caris LeVert and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson, to be more 
aggressive 
in 
shooting 
off 

ball screens this season. But 
the 
Musketeers’ 
backcourt 

includes lengthy guards like 
6-foot-5 Edmond Sumner and 
6-foot-6 Trevon Bluiett, whose 
size could pose issues for the 
Wolverines as they look to 
take advantage of narrow open 
spaces around the perimeter.

“I just think you’ve got to be 

much more sound with your 
fundamentals,” 
Walton 
said, 

adding that Michigan has worked 
at getting players better looks 
off perimeter screens in recent 

practices. 
“(Shooting 
off 
the 
ball 

screen) 
has 

been preached 
since we all 
got here, to 
everybody 
(Beilein) 
has faith in 
to shoot the 
ball.”

The 

Wolverines’ 
smaller 
guards, 

however, 
could 
match 
up 

favorably against Xavier’s Myles 
Davis. If swingmen like LeVert 
and sophomore guard Aubrey 
Dawkins can take care of their 
opponent’s backcourt size, they 
could create openings for players 
like Walton and Albrecht to leave 
the 6-foot-2 Davis feeling kind of 
blue.

Beilein said he would wait 

until after Thursday’s practice 
to decide on a starting lineup for 
Michigan’s first legitimate test of 
the year. The Wolverines’ ninth-
year coach listed Doyle, Wilson, 
sophomore 
guard 
Kameron 

Chatman and junior forward 
Zak Irvin as being among a list 
of players he’s on the fence about 
starting.

Dawkins, LeVert and Walton 

all seem like safe bets to start, and 
while Beilein didn’t mention him 
specifically, Mark Donnal started 
in Michigan’s exhibition opener 
against Le Moyne and in both of 
its regular-season games to date.
