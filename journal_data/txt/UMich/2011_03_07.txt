'U' to receive
less funding if it

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
LANSING - Since he took
office in January, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder has repeatedly
spoken about the "shared sac-
rifice" required to right Michi-
gan's economy and balance the

state's budget. In . response,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman and presidents from
other public universities across
the state have been prepar-
ing for potential cuts to higher
education funding, while still
emphasizing the importance of
higher education to the state's
long-term fiscal health.
Snyder's budget proposal
calls for a 15-percent across-

CHANGES FROM LANSING
Mich igan to crack down on
student Bridge Card abuse

Stricter guidelines
for eligability to
take effect April 1
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily Staff Reporter
Thousands of college stu-
dents in Michigan may soon
no longer be eligible to receive
nearly $200 in federal tax

money each month to buy food.
While many students depend
on the money for meals, for
others this may just mean the
elimination of superfluous pur-
chases like late night pizza and
caffeinated beverages.
The Michigan Department
of Human Services will be
cracking down on abuse of the
Michigan Bridge Card program
- which provides federally
financed debit cards that can

be used for food expenses - by
establishing stricter qualifica-
tion guidelines that will take
effect April 1. Though state
officials intend for the program
to serve only those who are in
need, others find the new regu-
lations unwarranted.
Under the upcoming law,
Michigan residents are eligible
if they care for children, are
physically or mentally unfit for
employment or participate in

job training. Additionally, fed-
eral officials will evaluate pro-
gram applicants' income and
household size and will estab-
lish the amount of money an
individual is eligible to receive.
Michigan DHS Director
Maura Corrigan wrote in a Feb.
9 press release that the new
restrictions on Bridge Card use
will benefit those who need the
financial support it provides.

A2 law clinic offers support
for undocumented residents

Law students,
immigrants benefit
from program
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
After crossing the Ciudad
Juarez-El Paso border with her
family in 1997, an undocumented
woman now living in Michigan

said she hoped to escape the vio-
lence and poverty in Mexico and
establish a new life in the United
States.
"We came here because the
violence was starting to get out
of hand, and we were really poor
down in Mexico," the woman,
who requested anonymity, said.
"Sometimes we didn't have any
food. My mom worked two jobs,
my dad worked two jobs and we
were barely making any money."

But when the woman's family
members were arrested in Mich-
igan as a result of their undocu-
mented immigration status last
November, she faced the possi-
bility of deportation and turned
to the Michigan Immigrant
Rights Center in Ann Arbor for
legal aid.

Technique to allow
for more effective
viewing of tissue
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
Digitization and computer-
ized images will now help the
field of pathology with a new

technique developed by Univer-
sity researchers.
The innovative method,
called Spatially-Invariant Vec-
tor Quantization, will allow
pathologists to more accurately
and efficiently pinpoint signs of
disease. According to its devel-
opers, SIVQ carefully targets
signs of a disease, such as cell or
tissue abnormalities, by analyz-
ing digital images.

The findings were published
in the Journal of Pathology
Informatics online on Feb. 26.
Jason Hipp, co-lead author of
the findings, and contributing
author Ulysses Balis - both
pathologists at the University
Htespital - began working on
the SIVQ software's first algo-
rithm in the late '90s.

Gangs, police loot 10 government
officials' homes on the Ivory Coast

Increase in Pro-
Gbagbo security
cause violence
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -
Gangs of young people, actively
aided by uniformed police, ran-
sacked at least 10 houses in Abi-
djan belonging to officials allied
with the internationally recog-
nized president of Ivory Coast,
as heavy fighting broke out in the
country's west.
Security forces loyal to incum-
bent leader Laurent Gbagbo, who
refuses to cede power more than
three months after the United
Nations says he lost an elec-
tion, have turned to increas-
ingly criminal behavior in the
past week, killing six unarmed
women protesters in the street

on Thursday.
An eyewitness reported hav-
ing seen a pickup truck belong-
ing to the elite paramilitary
police force CECOS leaving the
house belonging to Alassane
Ouattara's finance minister on
Saturday. The CECOS truck was
loaded down with a refrigera-
tor, he said, and it later returned
to the house, owned by Charles
Koffi Diby, leaving a second time
with a large safe.
Dozens of teenagers smashed
the doors and windows of the
house and later leftwearing suits
and robes, carrying dishes and
other valuables, said the witness,
who asked not to be identified for
fear of retribution.
Hundreds of miles away in the
region bordering Liberia, heavy
fighting broke out between pro-
Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara forces.

On the Liberian side of the fron-
tier, Saah Nyuma, the deputy
director of the Liberia Refugee
Repatriation and Resettlement.
Commission, said he heard the
sounds of explosions coming
from Ivory Coast. At least one
mortar shell fell on the Liberian
side. A fighter allied with Ouat-
tara and who was reached by
telephone and who asked not to
be named for fear of reprisal, said
the fighting was occurring in the
border village of Toulepleu.
Top Ouattara adviser Amadou
Coulibaly said that police recruit
youth to participate in the loot-
ings, which began Thursday.
"They're trying to install an
atmosphere of terror," he said,
"but you can't do more than what
they've already done, firing on
unarmed women. They're get-
ting desperate."

Chirac first French
president to be
tried since Nazi-era
PARIS (AP) - After years of
claiming presidential immu-
nity to avoid legal proceedings,
Jacques Chirac is finally facing
a court.
The former president, a buga-
boo for George W. Bush during
his rush to war in Iraq, today
becomes France's first former
head of state to go on trial since
its Nazi-era leader was exiled
That is, if the whole case isn't
derailed by a last-minute protest
by another defendant.
If the trial goes ahead as
planned, Chirac, 78, faces a
month in court on charges that
he masterminded a scheme to
have Paris City Hall pay for work
that benefited his political party
when he was mayor - before he
became president in 1995.
A prison term is seen as
highly unlikely, but in principle
if convicted, Chirac could be
jailed for up to 10 years and fined
euro150,000 ($210,000).
France's restive political
circles are gearing up for next
year's presidential race, but the
fallout from this trial is unlikely
to hit anyone other than Chirac
and the nine other defendants

including a grandson of Gen.
Charles de Gaulle and a former
left-wing labor union leader.
Still, the trial looms as an
embarrassing coda to Chi-
rac's 12-year presidential term,
potentially denting his legacy,
recent philanthropic work and
image as one of France's most
popular personalities since he
left office.
The trial will also shine a
spotlight on the underside of
high-level politics that could
be uncomfortable background
noise for Chirac's successor and
one-time protege, President
Nicolas Sarkozy, who wants to
rebuild his depleted poll num-
bers before a possible re-elec-
tion bid.
The trial fuses two separate
but similar cases.
One of the other defendants,
former Chirac aide Remy Char-
don, says the two cases shouldn't
be combined. His lawyer told
The Associated Press he will
ask the judges Monday to decide
whether the decision was con-
stitutional, which could throw
the whole trial into disarray.
In the first case, investigat-
ing magistrate Xaviere Simeoni
in Paris has focused on claims
that Chirac had City Hall pay
for 21 contract hires who never
worked for the city but instead
worked for his party, then called

RPR. He faces charges of embez-
zlement and breach of trust.
Simeoni, in her order for Chi-
rac to stand trial, wrote that he
was the "conceiver, author and
beneficiary" of that system.
The other case, led by inves-
tigating judge Jacques Gazeaux
in the western Paris suburb of
Nanterre, centers on seven jobs
at Chirac's former party said to
be improperly paid for by City
Hall. Chirac is accused of illegal
conflict of interest in that case.
That case netted a conviction
and temporary ban from politi-
cal office in 2004 for Chirac's
longtime political ally Alain
Juppe, a former prime minister
who recently returned in a big
way to political life - and is now
foreign minister.
Chirac will answer for only
a fraction of the scandals that
have hounded him over the
years: the others were either
thrown out for a lack of evidence
or had exceeded the statute of
limitations. Even for those going
to court, he will answer for just
21 total jobs out of 481 turned up
in the investigation by Simeoni's
team: Those before 1992 are too
old to warrant prosecution.
Plus, under onerofthe unusual
aspects of France's legal sys-
tem, the Paris prosecutor, Jean-
Claude Marin, will actually
argue against a conviction.

The man suspected of ter-

Police say DNA confirmed that
Aaron Thomas, an unemployed

Thomas tried to hang him-

HAWAII
Volcanic lava
spews 65 feet after
crater's collapse
Scientists in Hawaii say a new
vent has opened at one of the
world's most active volcanoes,
sending lava shooting up to 65
feet high.
The Hawaiian Volcano Obser-
vatory says the fissure eruption
was spotted shortly after the
floor at the Pu'u O'o (PUU'-oo
Oh-oh) crater collapsed around 5
p.m. Saturday. It occurred along
the middle of Kilauea (kee-
LAH'-wey-ah) Volcano's east rift
zone.
Kilauea has been in constant
eruption since Jan. 3, 1983.
Volcanologist Janet Babb told
the Hawaii Tribune-Herald that
the fissure has expanded to about
535 yards long and that scientists
were hiking into the remote area
to observe the fissure and take
readings.

Amid ruins, Haiti's
Carnival resumes
Raucous crowds danced in
the streets of the Haitian capital
yesterday as the city celebrated
its first Carnival since last year's
devastating earthquake forced
the cancellation of the annual
festivities.
The parade filed past the
ruined facades of downtown
shops, and the normally busy
boulevard outside the collapsed
National Palace was turned into
a pedestrian zone for three days
of revelry. Organizers erected
a plywood wall to separate the
Carnival zone from the huge
Champ de Mars plaza, now a
camp for tens of thousands of
people made homeless by the

quake.
Many spectators grumbled
that Carnival was much smaller
than in the past. Others said the
city had no business holding the
celebration at all.

Japanese foreign

Japan's foreign minister sud-

tration of Prime Minister Naoto
Kan.
Seiji Maehara, 48, was foreign
minister for just six months, and
was viewed as a leading candi-

Maehara acknowledged, re-

Gadhafi's forces try
to stop rebel move
toward capital
BIN JAWWAD, Libya (AP)
- Forces loyal to Moammar
Gadhafi, some in helicopter gun-
ships, pounded opposition fight-
ers with artillery, rockets and
gunfire yesterday, dramatically
escalatingtheir counteroffensive
to halt the rebels' rapid advance
toward the capital
They also battled to loosen the
grip of rebels on two cities close
to Tripoli. But in at least one
case, their tactics appeared to
lead them into atrap.
Residents said pro-Gadhafi
troops punched into the city of
Misrata, 120 miles (200 kilome-
ters) east of Tripoli, the capi-
tal, with mortars and tanks but
were pushed out five hours later
by rebel forces. The rebel com-
manders intentionally opened
the way for government tanks to
enter the city, then surrounded
them and attacked with anti-
aircraft guns and mortars, said
Abdel Fatah al-Misrati, one of
the rebels.
"Our spirits are high," al-Mis-
rati said. "The regime is strug-

gling and what is happening is
a desperate attempt to survive
and crush the opposition. But the
rebels are in control of the city."
As fighting across Libya grew
more fierce, the international
community appeared to be
struggling to put military muscle
behind its demands for Gadhafi
to give up power. -
A small British delegation
sent to talk to the rebels head-
quartered in the main eastern
city of Benghazi, meanwhile,
was arrested by the rebels them-
selves, who said the group had
entered the country without
permission. The rebels have set
up an interim governing council
that is urging international air-
strikes on Gadhafi's strongholds
and forces, though they strongly
oppose foreign intervention on
the ground.
Yesterday's fighting appeared
to signal the start of a new phase
in the conflict, with Gadhafi's
regime unleashing its air power
on the rebel force trying to oust
the ruler of 41 years. Resorting
to heavy use of air attacks sig-
naled the regime's concern that
it needed to check the advance of
the rebel force toward the city
of Sirte - Gadhafi's hometown

met by hundreds of
counter-protestors
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -
About 700 people rallied yes-
terday in support of Republican
Gov. Scott Walker and his anti-
union plan to balance the bud-
get - a demonstration meant
to counter three weeks of large
anti-Walker protests in and
around the state Capitol.
The rally was the culmi-
nation of a 10-stop bus tour
sponsored by the conservative
advocacy group Americans for
Prosperity that started Thurs-
day in Kenosha. It took place
at the Aliant Energy Center in
Madison, which is a couple of
miles from the Capitol, where
thousands of pro-union dem-
onstrators rallied Saturday and
yesterday.
Hundreds of pro-union
counter-protesters lined up
outside the arena entrance and
parking lot carrying placards
and chanting "Shame!" at the
Walker supporters. The gov-
ernor's backers held their own
signs with messages such as "I
Stand with Walker" and "Dems
Serve Unions not 'The People."'
Matt Seaholm, the state
director of Americans for Pros-
perity, said the purpose of the
bus tour and rallies was to show
that Walker still has support
among those who voted him
into office in November.
"We've got to continue the
push!" he said at the rally to
loud cheers. "It's not going to
end anytime soon."
The legislation was passed
in the Republican-controlled
Assembly but stalled in the state

Senate because its 14 Demo-
cratic members fled the state to
deprive their Republican col-
leagues of the quorum they'd
need to vote on the bill.
Walker defends the anti-
union bill as necessary to help
Wisconsin plug a $3.6 billion
budget hole, but unions and
Democratic opponents say it
overreaches and is more about
busting the unions than bal-
ancing the budget because
it aims to strip most public
employees of nearly all their
collective bargaining rights.
Union leaders have agreed
to pay more for their benefits,
which equates to an 8 percent
pay cut, as Walker has pro-
posed as long as they can retain
their bargaining rights. Walker
has refused to compromise,
although he said last week
that he was negotiating some
changes with Democrats.
Walker spokesman Cullen
Werwie said yesterday there
were no new developments
with the negotiations. One of
the 14 Democrats, Sen. Tim
Cullen, said Saturday that the
talks with Walker broke down
on Thursday.
With the bill stalled, Walker
said layoffs may be necessary
so the state can start to realize
the $30 million savings he had
assumed would come from the
concessions. All state workers,
except those at prisons, state
hospitals and other facilities
open around the clock, would
be potential layoff targets.
Walker informed state
employee unions Friday that he
intends to issue layoff notices
to 1,500 workers that would be
effective on April 4.
The pro-Walker rally comes
after tens of thousands of peo-

ple protested on Saturday at
the Capitol for a third straight
weekend. The previous two ral-
lies attracted about 70,000 and
more than 80,000. About 5,700
people had been at the Capi-
tol as of early yesterday after-
noon, the state Department of
Administration estimated.
At the Americans for Pros-
perity rally, former Madison
school board member Nancy
Mistele accused unions of being
concerned only with maintain-
ing their power, and not with
taking care of their rank-and-
file members.
"Democrats andunions stand
for bankrupting our state," she
said. "Shame on them."
Joel Ninneman, a 51-year-old
information technology spe-
cialist from the Madison area
who is a Walker supporter, said
the Democratic state senators
should allow the vote.
"It's time our state sena-
tors get back and do the job
they were elected to do," said
Ninneman, 51.
One of the union backers out-
side the rally, Jeannie Fiegel,
60, of Madison, said she wished
those who were supporting the
bill would get informed on all
the issues at play. She said the
protesters' efforts were paying
off.
"The bill isn't passed, is it?"
she said.
The rally's organizer, Amer-
icans for Prosperity, launched
a $320,000 television ad cam-
paign in support of Walker's
proposal last month. The
group is heavily financed by
billionaire brothers David and
Charles Koch, who own Koch
Industries Inc. and who sup-
ported Walker's election cam-
paign.

White House praises Muslims
before congressional hearings

Protestors rallied
in Time Square
against hearing
STERLING, Va. (AP) -
Muslim Americans are not part
of the terrorism problem fac-
ing the U.S. - they are part of
the solution, a top White House
official said yesterday at a
Washington-area mosque.
Deputy National Security
Adviser Denis McDonough set
the Obama administration's
tone for discussions as tensions
escalate before the first in a
series of congressional hear-
ings on Islamic radicalization.
The hearings, chaired by New
York Republican Peter King,
will focus on the level of coop-
eration from the Muslim com-
munity to help law enforcement
combat radicalization.
The majority of the recent
terror plots and attempts
against the U.S. have involved
people espousing a radical and
violent view of Islam. Just a
few weeks ago a college student
from Saudi Arabia who studied
chemical engineering in Texas
was arrested after he bought
explosive chemicals online. It
was part of a plan to hide bomb
materials inside dolls and baby

carriages and blow up dams,
nuclear plants or the Dal-
las home of former President
George W. Bush.
King said the Muslim com-
munity could and should do
more to work with law enforce-
ment to stop its members from
radicalizing and recruiting
others to commit violence.
"I don't believe there is
sufficient cooperation" by
American Muslims with law
enforcement, King said Sunday
on CNN's "State of the Union."
"Certainly my dealings with
the police in New York and
FBI and others say they do
not believe they get the same
- they do not give the level of
cooperation that they need."
In New York City on yester-
day, about 300 protestors gath-
ered in Times Square to speak
out against King's hearing,
criticizing it as xenophobic and
saying that singling out Mus-
lims, rather than extremists, is
unfair.
McDonough said that
instead of condemning whole
communities, the U.S. needs
to protect them from intimida-
tion.
McDonough spoke to an
interfaith forum at a Northern
Virginia mosque known for
its longtime relationship and

cooperation with the FBI. The
executive director of the cen-
ter, Imam Mohamed Magid,
also spoke, as did speakers
from a local synagogue and a
Presbyterian church.
The administration has
tried to strike a balance on
the thorny issue, working to
go after homegrown Islamic
extremists without appearing
to be at war with the Muslim
world. There has been an effort
to build stronger relationships
with Muslims - internation-
ally and in the United States.
During his remarks yester-
day, McDonough called the
mosque a "typically American
place" and said it reminded him
of his Catholic parish where he
grew up in Minnesota.
"Being religious is never un-
American. Being religious is
quintessentially American," he
said.
He commended the
mosque's members for taking
"an unequivocal stand against
terrorism."
"You've sent a message that
those who perpetrate such
horrific attacks do not rep-
resent you or your faith, and
that they will not succeed in
pitting believers of different
faiths against one another,"
McDonough said.

FROM THE DAILY
Not qiuite open enough
'U' must allow gender-neutral housing for all
Before students left for Spring Break, progress was made
toward enacting Open Housing at the University. The Michi-
gan Student Assembly and supporters of the Open Housing
Initiative have worked hard to motivate the University to implement
this policy. And the University has worked hard to compromise on,
rather than completely enact, this initiative. At a Feb. 23 round table,
the University announced its plans to allow students who openly
identify themselves as transgender to have roommates of their iden-
tified gender. While this proposed plan is progressive, it is far from
complete. The University needs to allow gender-neutral housing for
all University students, not just transgender students.

According to a Feb. 24 Michigan Daily
article, the proposed policy is currently being
drafted and is expected to take effect this fall.
This decision represents progress. Members of
the LGBTQ community need to feel comfort-
able and safe in their living environments, and
the quicker this plan is put into place, the bet-
ter. But this policy only protects a portion of
the student community. And as MSA President
Chris Armstrong said in the article, the plan is
"a departure" from "the comprehensive gen-
der-neutral housing policy the Open Housing
Initiative requested."
Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clement
wasn't a transgender student, but he took his
life last September as a result of being victim-
ized by his roommate because of his sexual ori-
entation. As a response to this event, Rutgers
University announced last week that it's going
to allow gender-neutral housing in some of its
dormitories, according to aMarch 1 USAToday.
com article. Beginning this fall, three dormito-
ries on Rutgers' campus will allow students of
any identified gender to livetogether in gender-
neutral rooms.
According to an article in the Daily Targum
- Rutgers University's student newspaper -
the oly concernthe university expressed with
the new program is that ifa student moves out
of his orher room, it maybe more difficult to fill

that space. The university needs to realize that
while this could be a problem, students who
switch dorm rooms is an issue in university
housing regardless of the gender of the room-
mates. And Rutgers' policy was created so that
both students have to agree to live together in
gender-neutral housing, which would decrease
the instances of students moving rooms.
It's important the University of Michigan
ensures that all students feel comfortable
in their housing - including students in the
LGBTQ community. The University, including
students and faculty, took a strong stance when
former assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell accused Armstrong of promoting a
"radical homosexual agenda" on his blog this
fall. While support from campus was positive,
the University needs to ensure that it's not just
protecting the needs of LGBTQ students after
they've been victimized, but also working to
prevent problems before they arise.
No student should be forced into a living
situation that they're uncomfortable with
because of their identified gender or sexual
orientation. The University has made progress
in a policy for open housing for transgender
students. But it needs to make sure that all stu-
dents' needs are being considered as adminis-
trators move forward with the implementation
of this policy.

'm a graduate student at the
University. Quick, how much
money did I make last year?
That doesn't
sound like a
hard question.
Especially dur-
ing tax season
- the University
actually fills out
a form for me e
saying what my
total earnings NEILL
as an employee MOHAMMAD
were. Accord-
ing to my W-2,
I earned a little more than $24,000
for the entire year. This sounds
about right. I worked as a graduate
student research assistant for the
entire calendar year and was paid as
if I were a graduate student instruc-
tor with astandard.50 appointment.
Of course, nothing is so straight-
forward. Not in a Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization contract . year.
A new contract will be signed in a
month or so, in which the adminis-
tration will concede on no-brainer
issues like improving accommoda-
tions for disabled GSIs - which was
finally accepted in principle just two
weeks ago - and with any luck will
agree to a small pay increase that
just barely keeps pace with inflation.
Wages are usually the most contro-
versial topic among the wider Uni-
versity community. Judging from
some of the remarks that readers
have left in the comment sections
for The Michigan Daily's coverage
of the negotiations, asking for a raise
is an act of unmitigated gall, par-
ticularly in the prevailing economic
climate.
That's an odd position to take
when you consider what the Univer-
sity budget actually looks like. The
campus employs about 1,800 GSIs
a semester. GSIs received about
$8,500 per semester in the 2009-

2010 academic year that comes out
to a total of $28 million in GSI sal-
ary. That probably sounds like a lot
of money until you consider that
the University's total revenue from
tuition and state support alone,
which over the same period of time
was $1.2 billion. GSIs, who are
responsible for about 25 percent of
in-class instruction and a still larger
share of grading, represent only 2
percent of the operating budget. It's
an incredibly modest amount to put
toward the core educational mission
of the University.
Of course, GSIs' actual take-
home pay is only one piece of the
puzzle. They also get tuition waiv-
ers, which are nominally valued at
$36,000 per year. This allows some
to claim that my annual income
is actually $60,000. The median
household in the United States, by
comparison, makes about $50,000
per year. From the perspective of
undergraduates who are paying
their own way through school, that
looks like an embarrassment of
riches. But the truth is a little more
complicated.
Unlike medical or law students,
doctoral students aren't likely to see
their tuition payments turn into a
high-paying job when they finish
their program. Starting salaries as
an assistant professor in many fields
are on the order of $50,000 a year.
That, needless to say, is still a lot of
money, but it would pale in compari-
son to five (or six, or seven) years of
tuition incurred in the process. I
don'tibrng-this up in order to cry
poverty - no one goes into academic
work strictly for the money, so it's
not like any of this is a surprise per
se - but rather to point out that the
labor economics of this trade-off are
pretty simple: If GSIs weren't grant-
ed a tuition waiver, it wouldn't make
sense for anyone tobe a GSI. This is
especially true at a leading institu-

tion like the University, whose grad-
uate students are even more likely
than most to have more lucrative
career options.
Nothing is
straight-forward
in a contract year.
And the other implications are
straightforward: In the absence
of tuition waivers, the University
would either have to deal with a
dramatic decline in graduate stu-
dent quality - and along with it a
corresponding collapse in the qual-
ity of undergraduate education - or
spend even more money on hiring
lecturers and professors to make
up the difference. Neither of those
are attractive alternatives from the
point of view of the undergraduate
students whose tuition payments
are footing such a large share of the
bill for the University's operation in
the first place, which is why it's so
mystifying that the opinions of stu-
dents (and alumni) on the GEO are
commonly so split. Whether or not
you think GSIs are overpaidby some
other measure, the GEO contract
structure is a pretty good bargain
for students and Michigan taxpay-
ers when you consider the alterna-
tive of hiring anyone else to do the
same work.
-Which is all just to establish that
graduate student salaries are exact-
ly what our W-2s say they are. No
more, no less. And I can't sayl'll feel
guilty if GSI salaries climb from 2.2
percent to 2.3 percent of the Univer-
sity's total outlay either.

Amid all the recent noise and chaos in
the Middle East, one crucial voice seems to
be missing - Al-Qaeda. What's perhaps the
most notoriously linked group to that region
has been absent from the picture altogether.
Throughout protests in more than 10 Arab
nations - and regime change in at least two
- there has been no word of involvement by
Al-Qaeda. Onlytime will tellif this silence will
be the fall of Al-Qaeda's regime. But, for the
time being, it provides the United States with
a great opportunity - an opportunity to make
allies in a region where it needs them most.
If the terrorist network is aiming to seize
the moment, it has failed miserably thus far.
Osama bin Laden has said nothing on the issue
of the revolutions, and his right-hand man
Ayman al-Zawahiri - an Egyptian, at that -
released three statements, none of which so
much as mentioned former Egyptian Presi-
dent Hosni Mubarak. The lack of involvement
by Al-Qaeda in what is perhaps the biggest
populist Arab movement the region has ever
seen will, undoubtedly, weaken the terrorist
network in the future.
Not only was Al-Qaeda uninvolved, but in
some ways it was defied. Accordingto a Feb. 27
New York Times article, the protest movement
in Egypt gained power by shunning the "mur-
derous violence and religious fanaticism" of
Al-Qaeda. It's one thing to overthrow the dic-
tatorial regimes of the Arab world that neither
Zawahiri nor bin Laden were particularly fond
of; it's another to do so through nonviolent,
secular, peaceful, pro-democracy protests.
Many experts on the Middle East have
claimed that the recent events are spelling
out disaster for Al-Qaeda and other terrorist
groups around the world. Paul Pillar, a CIA
researcher on the Middle East said in a Feb. 27
New York Times article, "so far the score card
looks pretty terrible for Al Qaeda." In the same
article, Brian Fishman, a terrorism expert at

the New America Foundation said, "knocking
off Mubarak has been Zawahiri's goal for more
than 20 years, and he was unable to achieve it.
Now a nonviolent, nonreligious, pro-democ-
racy movement got rid of him in a matter of
weeks. It's a major problem for Al Qaeda."
What's a problem for Al-Qaeda may be an
opportunity for the United States. Where Al-
Qaeda is losing influence, the United States
has a chance to step in and gain allies. The
revolutions are giving a political voice to a
new generation - a younger more active gen-
eration. A generation that has grown up see-
ing the world of Twitter, Facebook and Google
and doesn't want to be left behind. A genera-
tion that might just bend the legacy of autoc-
racy in these nations toward democracy.
These nations aren't under the control of
bin Laden and they house a majority of the
world's Muslim population. Fostering good
relations with the new governments that
emerge is a beneficial course of action for the
United States. These are nations that arose out
of a desire for democracy - now that democ-
racy may not be the American brand, but it's
democracy nonetheless. Not only is this an
opportunity for the United States to make
friends in a strategically important area, but
it's an opportunity to champion liberty aswell.
Now, there's no guarantee the revolutions
will quell religious extremism once and for
all. In fact, social unrest, lack of structured
government, and lessened domestic security
are all conducive to the rise of militant groups.
But there still is a chance that these revolu-
tions might give way to democratic regimes in
the Middle East - regimes that shun the ide-
als of extremist terrorist groups. And, in these
nations, the United States may find its most
valuable allies in the War on Terror.

On any given day, many men open doors for me, and I
make ita point to smile and say thank you. I'm a woman
who identifies as afeminist. Contraryto what Anny Fang
claimed in her blog post (There are bigger issues than
holding doors, 2/17/11) these are not mutually exclusive.
Fang's article was riddled with tired cliches that only
perpetuate stereotypes about a heterogeneous group of
people (yes, there are plenty of men who embrace femi-
nism). It was disheartening, but not surprising.
I'm a feminist because I'm committed to equality and
making sure that women's rights are protected. How-
ever, I know that proudly asserting my feminism will
elicit eye-rolls and groans from the uninitiated, and I'm
expecting at least one comment claiming that I'm a fem-
inist because I'm probably incapable of snagging aboy-
friend. But I have bigger things to worry about like the
fact that the GOP recently attempted to redefine rape or
one in six women in the United States will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime. Those are feminist issues. I've
taken a number of women's studies classes, and I've yet
to read any feminist theory that rallies against men for
monopolizing door-opening duties.
In her blog post Fang calls feminism "futile." I found
this baffling considering we have feminism to thank for
securing women's suffrage and fighting for sexual agen-
cy. Modern feminism is concerned with fighting for the
rights of all women - including women of color, queer
women and women of lower-socioeconomic class. Femi-
nism is about recognizing disparities and attempting to
rectify them. I may be a privileged woman by virtue of
my education, but this doesn't apply to all women.
It would be impossible for me to try and comprehen-
sively define feminism - the University has deemed the
topic important enough to dedicate a department to the
subject. In the United States feminism came in three
waves, and each wave of feminism had different ideas
and beliefs. It would be narrow-minded to say all Chris-
tians are against gay marriage when in reality there's
an immense amount of Christians with diverse beliefs.
Feminism is the same way. Maybe there are feminists
who think all men are chauvinistic, but I know plenty

of men - gay and straight - who are strong feminists.
Unfortunately, the stereotypes persist.
If, for some reason, my feminist beliefs come up in
casual conversation, someone will inevitably ask if I
shave my legs. And if one more guy tells me he is a bra-
burning supporter, I may lose faith in humanity. What
hurts the most is when fellow women are proudly anti-
feminist - usually in an attempt to win the affections of
some guy. I remember when one friend gleefullyousted
me as feminist to a bunch of guys at a party. "Cassie's
a feminist," she sneered, not even bothering to modify
the word feminist - the implied adjectives might as well
have been scrawled across my face: ballbreaker, femin-
azi and that one word used to knock a woman down to
size-Bitch. By invoking the F-word, she established her-
self as the universally revered "Guy's Girl," and I was
cast off as a militant man-hater. Yes, these are stereo-
types feminists have to contend with and probably have
stopped many would-be feminists from identifying as
one. You don't have to be a women's studies major to be a
feminist - I'm not. I don't even belong to any explicitly
feminist groups on campus. Feminism is multifaceted,
but it ultimately teaches people to be critical of power
- not men.
If rights for women around the world are important
to you, you're probably a feminist. If your heart soared
when you saw Egyptian women standing shoulder to
shoulder with men in Tahrir Square, you might be a fem-
inist. If you think all women should have access to birth
control and family planning services, you're probably
a feminist. If you're a woman who likes sex, you might
be a feminist. If you see that Republicans tried to pass
the (laughably named) Protect Life Act - which would
allow anti-abortion doctors to let a pregnant woman die
rather than perform an abortion - as a brazen attack on
women, you might be a feminist. Don't be afraid to iden-
tify as one just because of how someone will react. The
movement needs your voice, and now that it's faltering,
maybe now more than ever.

TUITION
From Page IA
schools will receive even less
money from the state if the cost
of their in-state tuition increases
by more than 17.1 percent - the
state average of tuition increas-
es over the past five years. If
the University increases tuition
above this percentage, it will see
about a 20 percent reduction in
state funding.
Despite the prospect of facing
such a large cut in state fund-
ing, University officials said they
knew drastic reductions were
coming, and they've been pre-
paring for the scenario for sev-
eral years.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily last month,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said the University has
projected cost savings for the
next several years to ensure the
University's financial solvency.
She added that the University
began cutting costs five or six
years ago to prepare for potential
budget cuts.
"We're in a cycle now to con-
tinue the cost savings," Coleman
said. "We've even projected out
to 2017 because in our view we're
going to have to make ourselves
more efficient, get value for every
dollar that's being spent (and)
make tough decisions because
we don't see the economic cli-
mate in the country bouncing
back any time soon."

In a continuing effort to
reduce costs, University Pro-
vost Philip Hanlon said in an
interview last month that the
University has undertaken cost
savings measures by combin-
ing several IT units- saving the
University $7 million, and by
decreasing the amount of gen-
eral fund money given to the
schools within the University by
$20 million.
"Looking ahead to the next
fiscal year (the cuts) could get
deeper, but that's what we're
executing right now," Hanlon
said. "That's having impacts
on how often small classes are
offered (and) the hiring of staff.
We're doing our absolute best to
protect our core academic mis-
sions and have the impact on stu-
dents be as minimal as possible."
On Wednesday, Coleman
joined Grand Valley State Uni-
versity President Thomas Haas,
Ferris State University President
David Eisler and Oakland Uni-
versity President Gary Russi in
testifying before the state Senate
and House Appropriations Sub-
committees on Higher Education
at the State Capitol in Lansing.
In her testimony before the
House subcommittee, Coleman
emphasized the University's
commitment to cutting costs and
its dedication to ensuring that
tuition is affordable for all stu-
dents. The University plans to
reduce costs by $100 million by
2012 and by another $120 million
by 2017.

Coleman also said the Univer-
sity has offered "historic" levels
of financial aid to students in
recent years.
"These extraordinary
amounts of support mean that a
typical Michigan resident under-
graduate student with an income
of under $80,000 pays less today
than in 2004," Coleman said. "...
We are a better bargain today
than when I first came to the
University in 2002."
A 15-percent slash in state
funding would translate into a
nearly $47.5 million reduction
in state funding from the cur-
rent $316 million state dollars
allocated to the University. That
amount would increase by about
$14 million, or 5.2 percent, if
the University doesn't meet the
state's tuition guidelines.
Both Hanlon' and Coleman
said at this point in the budget
process they don't know wheth-
er the University will be able to
keep tuition increases below the
7.1-percent threshold.
"Ultimately it's up to the
regents to approve tuition, so I
don't want to get ahead of that
process at all," Hanlon said.'"...
I'm hopeful that we would want
to stay underneath that cap any-
way, but again, I always hate
to say anything about tuition
because it's up to the Board to
make tuition."
The University's Board of
Regents typically sets tuition
levels at its June meeting when
the University's budget is

released. In 2010, the regents
increased tuition by 1.5 per-
cent for in-state students - the
smallest increase since 1984-
but increased tuition for out-of-
state students by 3 percent. The
last time tuition was raised by
more than 7.1 percent was for the
2007-2008 academic, when the
regents increased the price of in-
state and out-of-state students'
tuition by 7.4 percent.
A 7.1-percent tuition hike
would translate to an increase of
$827 for Michigan residents pay-
ing lower division LSA tuition,
and non-resident students would
be have to pay $2,542.66 more
for lower division LSA tuition.
Coleman said in her testimony
last week that she will work to.
guarantee that the University
fulfills its mission, regardless of
how much state funding is ulti-
mately cut.
"The University of Michigan is
a treasured public asset, and my
job as its president is to ensure
its future for the next 200 years,"
Coleman said. "I will not allow
its value to diminish under my
leadership. Everyday we honor
the public's longstanding invest-
ment by attracting talented stu-
dents and faculty to Michigan as
well as watching the bottom line
that ensures taxpayers receive a
strong return on their dollars."
Coleman added that the Uni-
versity has remained steadfast in
its goals to educate students and
conduct research even in eco-
nomic downturns. She said the

University has actually grown
and expanded during previous
economic slumps and cited that
the Law Quadrangle, Rackham
Graduate Building and Burton
Memorial Tower were built dur-
ing the Great Depression in the
1930s, and the University Hospi-
tal was built during the recession
in the 1980s.
"This is not the first time our'
state has faced difficult eco-
nomic times," she said. "We can
all point to challenging eras of
dwindling resources, and yet
generation after generation of
the state's leaders and citizens
have supported the University of
Michigan."
Coleman added that like her,
Snyder also believes higher edu-
cation will be the catalyst for
economic turn-around in the
state.
"As Governor Snyder has said,
world-class universities are one
of our biggest assets," Coleman
said. "Higher education, with all
of its contributions to society, is
how Michigan will reclaim its
prominence. We know a Uni-
versity of Michigan education
makes a difference."
Coleman said in an inter-
view after the hearing that it
was important for her to testify
before the committees because
a number of senators and repre-
sentatives are newly elected.
"I was really happy to (testi-
fy) because alot of these people
were brand new, and they haven't
heard me talk about the Univer-

sity of Michigan and they don't
know necessarily about some of
the programs," she said. "And
one of my jobs is to educate them
... And I think based on some of
the questions they asked, they
got it. They understand what I
was talking about."
State Rep. Bob Genetski (R-
Saugatuck), chair of the statg
House Appropriations Subcon-
mittee on Higher Education, said
in an interview last week that he
was glad the university presil-
dents testified, as it provided
more education for the Legisla-
ture to make its "big decisions"
about the budget.
Like Coleman, Genetski said
the state's public colleges are
important in turning around the
state's economy. But he also said
the higher education budget was
one of only a handful of places
where the Legislature could cut
funds.
"When you look at the higher
ed budget, almost all of it is gen-
eral fund money," Genetski said.
Unfortunately, universities
are one of the few places from
where we can cut."
Genetski pointed out that in
Snyder's proposed budget for
the 2013 fiscal year, also released
last month, there are no further
reductions to the state's higher
education budget beyond what
Snyder proposed for 2012.
"(There are) no cuts next year
in the two-year budget," Genet-
ski said. "That's a very good and
very optimistic thing."


BRIDGE CARDS
From Page 1A
"We're ready to extend a help-
ing hand to any citizen who is
truly in need - including col-
lege students who care for young
children and are taking the right
steps toward becoming self-suf-
ficient," Corrigan wrote. "But
those who don't meet federal
guidelines won't be able to take
advantage of what is meant to be
a temporary safety net program."
The Bridge Card program
serves about 1.9 million Michi-
gan residents, and DHS estimates
that up to 20,000 of those users

are students, according to DHS
spokesman Christina Fecher.
The previous DHS adminis-
tration had been following fed-
eral instructions for use of the
money allocations, but the cur-
rent administration requested to
grant the state regulation rights
when officials realized many stu-
dents take advantage of the pro-
gram, Fecher wrote in an e-mail
interview.
The new state regulations are
expected to eliminate many of
those students from the program
by removing eligibility of any
student "attending college with
an approved education plan,"'
Fecher wrote.

State Rep. Dave Agema (R-
Grandville), one of the first law-
makers to take action against
abuse of the Bridge Card pro-
gram, said the need for change
became obvious when numbers
demonstrated a vast increase
in Michigan college students
applying for financial assistance
through the program.
"It went viral," Agema said.
"Too many people were asking to
get on, and it drew our attention
to it. In one county, two-thirds
of the new people (applying for
cards) were college students."
While some legislators view
the forthcoming restrictions on
the program as an end to mon-

etary waste, others think the
move is a negative one.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said the law is likely
to change before it is actually
enforced. He added that the state
may be moving in the wrong
direction by focusing on abuse
by college students only.
"I think that in a country
that is the richest country in the
world, and the most prosperous
country in the history of human-
kind, it's a shame that we're try-
ing to lower the ceiling rather
than raise the floor," Irwin said.
"We're trying to cut back on pro-
grams that help people. There
are times when it gets abused

whether (Bridge Card users) are
college students or adults."
But Agema said students who
weren't necessarily in dire need
of food assistance were using
the program, adding that the
decrease in student use will
allow for reallocation of millions
of dollars through the Bridge
Card program.
"It was too easy to get on, and
it's too easy to lie," Agema said.
"That's why Indiana had almost
no students on (food assistance
support) and we had (thou-
sands), on Bridge Card because
some were coming from wealthy
homes. People were getting a
Bridge Card that weren't finan-

ciallyneedyand didn't qualifyby
other standards."
Students opposed to the new
law include LSA senior Jenni-
fer Zobel, who is fighting the
changes with a petition she said
she plans to take to Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder's office after
she gets 20,000 signatures.
"My roommate and I started
(the petition) because we think
it's unfair for the government to
just target one group of people
that utilize the Bridge Card,"
Zobel said. "Instead of changing
the (laws) to make it harder for
everyone, they're just (targeting)
college students and that doesn't
seem right."


DANA BUILDING
From Page 1A
dents and faculty members who
frequent the Dana Building have
grown accustomed to the sound
and have even come to recognize
its timing.
"It's good for comic relief in a
morning lecture," Rackham stu-
dent James Mulligan said.
While the noises are funny for

some, they're irritating for oth-
ers like Rackham student Mat-
thew Boutin.
"It is very annoying. We were
in this room and there were real-
ly whiny noises," Boutin said as
he offered his own high-pitched
interpretation of the sound.
Stanton Jones, associate pro-
fessor in the SNRE, agreed that
the noises can be a distraction.
"The first couple of times it did
(distract me) because I just wasn't

expecting it," Jones said. "It
causes me to have to stop (class)."
Some students said classes
take an interim break at the
sound of the noise.
"We usually just sit there and
wait it out," Rackham student
Lindsay Hanna said. "It's usually
15 seconds or so."
Jones said he thinks the
sounds are due to heating issues,
but the actual source of the
sounds has yet to be identified.

"There's no fix for it," Jones
said. "It's what the heating in the
building is unless we totally went
to a different mode of heat for the
entire building."
Students offered different
explanations for the reason for
the sounds.
"Someone said that they had
been told that it was the piping,"
Hanna said.
Lara Ann Nelson, the director
of budget and administration for

SNRE, said her office has never
heard any noises or received any
complaints about them. None of
the students interviewed said
they have approached adminis-
trators to report the issue.
In order to pinpoint the source
of the sound, Nelson said her
office would need more details.
But she said she couldn't think of
any reason the building's infra-
structure could be acting up.
The Dana Building was built

in 1901 but was renovated in
2004 to improve the building's
infrastructure and majke it more
environmentally friendly.
According to Jones, the noises
have also reportedly occurred in
past years.
"I think it's more of a distrac,
tion fornewstudentsthanitis for
students who've been here and
have been around it for awhile,"
Jones said. "At some point, it just
becomes background noise."

DISEASES
From Page 1A
failures and collaboration with
researchers from the Massachu-
setts General Hospital and Har-
vard Medical School, the current
SIVQ tool emerged as a potential
"game changer" for the field of
pathology, Hipp said.
Different from other pattern
recognition software currently
being used by physicians, the
SIVQ technique pinpoints cell
or tissue abnormalities using

circular vectors instead of the
traditional square or rectangle-
shaped search tools. The circular
vectors can identify the features
of an image no matter the image
orientation.
"The idea of the tool is to
help improve diagnoses, (and)
help pathologists provide bet-
ter patient care," Hipp said. "It
adds a quantitative component to
a profession that is based on an
art."
Ideally, the tool will allow
pathologists to use digital imag-
es of the body's tissues in more

prolific ways, according to Balis,
who is the director of the Divi-
sion of Pathology Informatics
Division at the University Medi-
cal School.
"Now that pathologists have
access to digital images, the
challenge has been what to do
with them," Balis explained.
"Pathologists generally don't do
anything with digital images
other'than look at them."
Hipp said the tool can be used
to identify carcinomas - an
invasive malignant tumor - and
certain cancer-prone areas like

the prostate.
"The idea would be to have
the computer program help the
pathologist identify the cancer
glands," he said.
Though SIVQ has the poten-
tial to hold "tremendous value"
for physicians, Hipp said, it isn't
intended to replace the work of
pathologists.
"We want to stress that this is
a tool to aid the pathologist," he
said.
Though the tool isn't likely to
enter the medical market any-
time soon, Balis said it has been

distributed throughout the aca-
demic community at institutions
like Rutgers University. Cornell
University has also expressed
interest in the tool.
"We're still in the very early
phases of identifying how this
technology can improve produc-
tivity ... for researchers as well as
at the clinical level," Balis said.
"The thought is that within a
year or two's time, this algorithm
could be a critical part of work-
flow. The technology highlights
the fact that there's much to be
optimistic about."

LAW CLINIC
From Page 1A
ship between the University of
Michigan Law School and the
Legal Services of South Central
Michigan - which offers free
legal services to individuals like
the undocumented women from
Mexico. Services include legal
consultation on issues such as
foreclosure, immigration rights,
family law, consumer law and
elder law.
The MIRC has been part of
the program for several years,
according to Carolyn Krieger, an
attorney in the clinic who worked
with the undocumented woman.
Krieger is an Equal Justice Works
AmeriCorps Legal fellow and one
of the two fellows in the MIRC.
Lorray Brown, co-manager
and consumer law attorney of
MPLP, said the poverty law clinic
- which began in 1997 - receives
federal funding to provide pro

bono legal services to underprivi-
leged populations. MPLP clients
must meet an income eligibil-
ity guideline and have an income
that falls below the national pov-
erty threshold.
"We're providing the same
kind of services that ageneral law
firm would, except the service is
for free, so poor people can come
to us and be able to get good rep-
resentation," Brown said.
The program also handles
cases involving systemic issues
that have a broader impact on
certain communities, Brown said.
"We wouldn't necessarily rep-
resent the individual person or
run into court to stop an eviction,
but if there's a policy or they're
shutting down an entire rental
unit of an entire subsidized apart-
ment building because of some
bad policy, we would get involved
in it because the decision would
result in very broad impacts,"
Brown said.
There are about similar pro-

grams similar to the MPLP
located throughout Michigan.
Brown said the Ann Arbor office
provides resources and support
for other field programs, which
include training, research and
litigation support.
Krieger said she operates a
project in the Ann Arbor office
that works specifically with
immigrants who are victims
of domestic violence or sexual
assault. Krieger said she helps her
clients to pursue U Visas, which
she said are for "undocumented
victims of crimes who are coop-
erative with the police."
Krieger said she also handles
cases involving issues with the
Violence Against Women Act for
instances in which women typi-
cally would petition to gain legal
status but are unable to do so
because of abuse.
"It gives the abuse victim a
path to basically petition for her-
self and getcherself a Green Card,"
Krieger said.

The MIRC also allows Law
School students to volunteer in
the center to gain knowledge and
experience with immigration law.
Katie Kersh, a first-year Law
School student, has been volun-
teering at the MIRC this semes-
ter. She said she decided to go to
law school because she wants to
pursue alegal career dealingwith
immigration issues.
To prepare for her future work
as a lawyer, Kersh works with
Krieger in the office and assists
clients in the process of filing
applications for U Visas.
"By helping (clients) with the
process, they can feel safe and
also they can not worry about
their abuser because they're
helping to put him in jail," Kersh
said. "And then also they can feel
a sense of security because they
have a visa now."
Using her proficiency in Span-
ish, Kersh said she is able to facil-
itate communication with clients
to get their account of a situation.

She, added that the process of
obtaining documents like police
reports can be difficult because
clients are sometimes afraid to
speak to the police since they're
undocumented.
"Sometimes it takes a lot for
them to get the courage to go
down to the police station," she
said.
Kersh, who is also a member of
an organization on campus called
Michigan Immigrant and Labor
Law Association, said her work
in this group and the MIRC has
helped broaden her understand-
ing of the human side of law.
"(The MIRC) has provided
not only that real life experience,
but it's also made me feel like I'm
really helping people instead of
just reading cases all day," she
said.
For the undocumented
woman, who said she wasn't
arrested because her two chil-
dren were born in the United
States, the MIRC has been help-

ful in answering her questions
and explaining the paperwork
necessary to become a legal resi-
dent or citizen, she said.
The client said though she
hasn't yet gone to court to obtain
documentation, she's met with
immigration officers in Detroit.
She added that she hopes her case
will be able heard in court this
month and that she is grateful to
have the clinic's services.
"(Krieger is) helping me for
free, and I started to see results
here and there, and I'm very con-
fident of her work," the client
said.
Krieger explained that the
MIRC is valuable for those on
both ends.
"Helping these women obtain
legal immigration status for the
first time in their lives is incred-
ibly rewarding," Krieger wrote
in an e-mail interview. "It's life
changing for them in a greater
way than really any other legal
outcome."

'Another Year' passes by

TV/NEW MEDIA COLUMN
Lost in the Web

Mediocre movie

into the passing of yet another
year through
the lens of
the lives of an
aging couple. Another Year
Tom (Jim
Broadbent, At the Michigan
"Harry Pot-

and Gerri (Ruth Sheen, "Heart-
less") go about their lives hap-
pily. They work in their garden,
cook dinner and gather around
the table with various friends
and relatives. By no means "I do
are their lives a fairy tale, but
somehow, that makes the real- live
ity of another year in our own of
lives unbearable. Tom and Gerri the
never suffer. Neither one seems to t
to have the usual arthritic pains the
that come with old age. Their som
single concern is that their only frie
son hasn't settled down yet. Like T
the coupling of their names, Tom (Les
and Gerri, their life together has Car
a cartoonish ring to it. holi
At the same time, the passing any
of a year in their lives is devoid Ken
of any sort of spark or passion. Ton

om and Gerri's friend Mary
sley Manville, "A Christmas
ol") is a needy desperate alco-
c who clings disgustingly to
man who gives her attention.
(Peter Wight, "Womb") is
m's childhood friend but is
bent on destroying himself
ough his overeating, smok-
and drinking. Ronnie (David

thly Hallows: Part 1"), Tom's
er brother, is consumed with,
f after the death of his wife

and stares blankly at walls all

It's these characters, though,
that make the movie so poi-
gnant. Manville's portrayal of
Mary is particularly enthralling.
As hard as it isto watch her wal-
low through her glasses of wine
and rant about the men who
have left her, she's likable and it
makes it that much harder when
her situation never changes over
the course of the year. Ronnie,
Ken and Mary are the ones who
provide humor; their characters,
unlike Tom and Gerri, can laugh
at-themselves. But they are the
ones that are lost in a flurry of
melancholy.
Perhaps what makes "Another
Year" so haunting is that none of

the characters deserving happi-
ness get it. Tom and Gerri don't
particularly seem to warrant the
quaint little lives they've dug out
for themselves. It's this quest for
happiness in an unjust world that
director Mike Leigh ("Happy-
Go-Lucky") dwells on the most.
And this theme gives the movie
a sort of elusive quality. Leigh
never makes clear why some of
his characters are deserving of
happiness and why others aren't.
As realistic as his portrayal and
his perspective is, it's hard not to
want some kind of an answer or
at least a satisfactory resolution.
This feeling of unending suffer-
ing makes "Another Year" a little
hard to endure, especially in the
doldrums of a Michigan winter.

it comes to

dozens of vol-
canoes erupt

and a meteor PANDEY
the size of
Jude Law's
forehead streaks towards earth.
Once upon a time, I was
always streets ahead when it
came to new technologies, espe-
cially those relating to film and
television. I spread the gospel
of Blu-ray a good three years
before it hit the consumer mar-
ket and I was even a beta tester
for Hulu back in 2007.
But when I went to visit my
friend Xin Xu at Duke Univer-
sity, I saw that somehow, I had
become the equivalent to an
-octogenarian looking up pot pie
recipes on the Google machine.
It all began when I casually
mentioned to Xin that I would
be requiring his television Sun-
day night to watch the Oscars.
"Well, that's a problem," he
replied. "Seeing as I don't have
cable."
Utter bewilderment fol-
lowed. What nonsense! How
does Xin freakin' Xu - the kid
who instilled my passion for
television in the first place by
introducing me to "Arrested
Development" and "Lost" back
in high school - not have a cable
subscription? He explained that
he just watches everything on
Hulu now.
As I launched into atirade
about how watchingshows on
a tiny laptop screen with lousy
computer speakers ruins the
experience, especially elimi-
natingthe novelty of watching
television asa social activity,
Xin sauntered over to his televi-
sion and booted up his PS3. Next
thing I knew, we were watching
the latest episode of "The Office"
in pristine high-definition on his
glorious 42-inch flatscreen with
a group of friends.
"You can watch Hulu on your
PS3?" I exclaimed. Xin respond-
ed in the affirmative, in his clas-
sic "I'm shocked by how stupid
you can be sometimes" tone.
Unbeknownst to me, my big-
gest issue with Hulu had been
eradicated, all without the
hassle of HDMI cables (and in
better quality, too).
It made complete sense - why
pay $200 a semester for a basic
cable package when Hulu Plus
was only $7.99 a month? ButI
thought I had uncovered a flaw
in Xin's plan the next night,
when he was planningto invite
friends over to watch (then) #t
Duke play Virginia Tech in col-
lege basketball. When Itasked
Xin how he planned to watch
the game without cable, he
reprised his "My god, you're
an idiot" tone, explainingthat
you can stream ESPN college
games on an Xbox. As he and his
friends cheered on Nolan Smith,
I sat in amazement at how rap-
idly everything has changed in
television.

My colleague Ankur Sohoni
discussed the digitization of
home video and its effect on the
film industry in a column last
month, arguing that despite the
advent of advanced home the-
ater systems and services like
On Demand, people will still go
to movie theaters because they
provide a matchless, captivating
experience.
The same can't be said for the
digitization of television. Inter-
net-streamed shows provide the
same experience - arguably,
because of unlimited access,
a better one - so why would
people put down cash for a cable
subscription?
The answer is, they won't
- according to The New York
Times, 216,000 cable subscrip-
tions were dropped in the sec-
and quarter of 2010, followed by
119,000 in the third quarter. A
significant factor to explain this
decline has to be people like Xin
who rely on Internet streaming
for their television habits.
Hulu - which is a jointven-
ture between ABC, NBC and
FOX - isn't going to just termi-
nate. It needs to exist, other-
wise people would pirate even
more than they do now, and the
networks wouldn't see a speck
of ad revenue from all these
pirates enjoyingtheir content.
But because Hulu exists, fewer
people can justify continuing
their cable subscriptions, espe-
cially when budgets are tight.
It's a catch-22.
I'm a digital
dinosaur.
People aren't going to stop
usingthe Internet to watch TV
now that the former has been
ingrained into our culture, so
the networks need to find away
to monetize Internet streaming.
And if they don't anytime soon,
it could be game over, man,
for networks like NBC. I can't
say I have a concrete solution
- if I did, I'd be sitting in ack
Donaghy's office up in 30 Rock-
efeller Plaza.
But networks need to begin
with producing shows directly
for the web - developing cheap,
high-quality programs for now
(A la "Children's Hospital"), and
producing "Lost"-caliber shows
in the future, once the model has
proven to be successful. I doubt
it'll be long before the next
"Community" premieres on a
web browser near you.
As for the Oscars, I could
have watched them in a common
room while Xin was at his tutor-
ing job, but instead, I decided
to bring my laptop to his work
and live stream the show so we
could watch it together. I did
feel a bit strange, watchingsuch
a prestigious presentation that I
look forward to each year more
than any other broadcast - for
the first time in my life, on the
Internet. But honestly, we're all
going to be watching them over
the Internet soon enough.

TV NOTEBOOK
Sheen-isn't winning' anymore

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
Partying with porn stars.
Stints in rehab (and not for a drug
called Charlie Sheen, but the real
kind). It's official. Charlie Sheen
is once again America's bad boy -
except he's 45, which makes him
more like America's bad middle-
aged man, which is kind of sad.
Actually, it's really sad.
In the past few weeks, the for-
mer "Two and a Half Men" star
lashed out against the show's
co-creator Chuck Lorre, openly
discussed his unorthodox route
to sobriety and gave countless
interviews espousing his twisted
views on drugs, relationships
and just about everything in
between. This was all in addition
to the inaugural episode of a live
webcast streamed directly from
his own home entitled "Sheen's
Korner."
I am not a psychiatrist and I do
not know the reason for Sheen's
outlandish behavior. What I do
know is that Twitter feeds and
tabloids alike have had a field
day with his endless rants and
tirades. It seems to take only a
few hours between a new Sheen
saying appearing on the Inter-
net and a magazine cover story

exploiting it for all it's worth
(Tiger Blood and Adonis DNA
anyone?). I suppose this is to be
expected; celebrity self-destruc-
tion fascinates and awes.
My question is, what exactly
attracts us to Charlie Sheen in
the first place? For the past eight
years he's been television's high-
est paid actor, garnering over $1
million for each episode of "Men."
On the series he plays Charlie
Harper, a hedonistic, womaniz-
ing resident of Malibu, Calif. who
drinks all the time, sleeps in and
visibly flaunts his money. In real-
ity, Sheen was raised in Malibu,
drinks, does drugs and sleeps
with lots of women. Is watching
Charlie Sheen play himself really
worth $1 million an episode?
I'll admit that "Two and a Half
Men" was funny for the first cou-
ple years. Loosely summarized,
the show depicts what happens to
Harper when his luxurious bach-
elor lifestyle gets upended once
his brother Alan (Jon Cryer) and
nephew Jake (Angus T. Jones)
come stay with him after Alan's
divorce. The writing was sharp
and the dichotomy between
Sheen, Cryer and Jones was
humorous in a sardonic sort of
way. This led to consistent rank-
ings as the number one sitcom

on television. It was even hailed left only with the real-life Sheen
by The New York Times as "the shouting his absurdities to any-
biggest hit comedy of the past one who will listen - call it what
decade." you will, but saying your brain is

ALBUM REVIEW
A dry desert romance

ByJULIASMITH-EPPSTEINER
Daily Arts Writer
Being a fan of exotic romance
in far-off deserts might be the
only driving reason to purchase
300Lovers.
DeVotchKa's
fifth studio
album takes a DeVotchKa
drastic depar-
ture from being 100 Lovers
"The Winner" ANTI-
(theme song
of "Little Miss
Sunshine" and energy commer-
cial score) and causes the band to
head toward a less sublimely epic
part of its 14-year career.
An internationally diverse
quartet born out of Denver,
DeVotchKa delivers a sound com-
monly labeled as "gypsy-punk"
or "indie-folk." Its interest in
being hip n' trendy is proven by
the scratchy black-and-white,
artificially antiqued cover art
of 100 Lovers. A man in a black
suit hovers inches above a can-
yon, while two umbrellas keep
him just above the sand of fail-
ure. The photograph presumably
was taken in the Arizona desert
where the band records all of its
albums.
"The Alley" and "All the Sand
In All the Sea," the two opening
tracks, have a cinematic sound-
scape of yearning and crescendo.
Lead singer Nick Urata's tenor
exaggerates the tracks' bewitch-
ingly rustic auras. This vivid
sound is driven from Urata's
experience in film composition.
His work on the recent film "I
Love You Phillip Morris," star-
ring Jim Carrey, has caused Ura-
ta's career to rise rapidly since it
was jumpstarted by the Grammy-
nominated soundtrack for "Little
Miss Sunshine" in 2006.
The pre-released single - a

strategically altered version of
the album title, "100 Other Lov-
ers" - is clearly the least risky
endeavor on the album. The
single is DeVotchKa's attempt
to appeal to the lowest common
denominator of the mass public
while remaining in its desert-
romance frame. The song is like
meeting someone and only being
able to say, "Well, he's nice" - it's
a wash of colorless chords and
monotonic murmurs from Urata.
Bursting with dysfunctional
love and syncopated handclaps
is "The Common Good." The
track begins with a Spanish bull-
fighting sound and transfers into
luxurious rock interwoven with
violin and exotically twisted lyr-
ics like, "Go ahead and chew me
up and spit me out."
100 Lovers throws its listen-
ers two under-60-second inter-
ludes that convincingly call to
mind an eerie, back-alley setting.
The entire middle portion of the
album is somewhat of a headache
- "The Man From San Sebastian"
and "Bad Luck Heels" will make
the listener drop his orher capote
cape and get out of the desert
quick.
"Exhaustible" lifts the album

above the canyon dirt, a musi-
cal foil to its title. The track is
complete with whistles, tambou-
rine, beautifully weighted vocals
and a beat that kicks to the core.
It depressingly contrasts with
"Ruthless" and the only thing
keeping "Exhaustible" from
drowning in its overemphasized
Mariachi and Bolero inspira-
tion is the seasoning of sexy steel
drums.
'100 Lovers' a
bit too much.
Wondering where the pinata
is to lighten the mood, the head-
ache-inducing fiesta continues
with the tings and dramatic ser-
enade of "Contrabanda." Succes-
sive to that fiesta, and leaving the
final touch on 100 Lovers, is the
droning-on "Sunshine" which
shines less than DeVotchKa must
have hoped for.
Not enough to sweep the
masses into your desert this
time, DeVotchKa. Not without
ibuprofen.

Director Miguel Arteta moved production of "Cedar Rapids" to Ann Arbor because of the Michigan film tax incentive.
Discussing'a pids'

Miguel Arteta talks
Ann Arbor-made
Midwest film
By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
Hailing from San Juan, Puer-
to Rico, award-winning direc-
tor and four-time Sundance film
festival participant Miguel Arte-
ta has roots about as far from the
Midwest as possible. Nonethe-
less, attending his own screen-
ing in cuffed jeans with simple
black lace-up shoes, his button-
down untucked, Arteta seemed
as down-to-earth as the charac-
ters in his wholesome new com-
edy "Cedar Rapids."
Though rather far removed
from the state where the film
takes place, Iowa, "Cedar Rap-
ids" was shot almost exclu-
sively in Ann Arbor's Clarion
Hotel. The hotel was chosen for
its unique structure, which
features a centralized, indoor
swimming pool. Further filming
took place at a ramshackle white
house on the outskirts of town,
which was demolished the day
after shooting wrapped up.
Representing an entirely dif-
ferent part of the country while
on location somewhere else the-
oretically poses some problems
from a production standpoint.
However, according to Arteta, it
was surprisingly simple to recre-

ate Iowa amid Ann Arbor's tree-
lined landscape.
"Fortunately the film is about
a convention ... very indoors,"
Arteta said in a recent interview
with The Michigan Daily. "And
both places (Cedar Rapids and
Ann Arbor) are cold! It was jus-
tifiable that we would be inside a
lot of the time."
"Cedar Rapids" was origi-
nally slated to be shot in the city
of the same name, but early on
in the production, a total col-
lapse of the Iowa film tax credit
incentive resulted in a dearth of
funds with which to produce the
film and a waste of eight weeks
of preparatory work. Fearful of
production falling far behind
and attracted by the 42-percent
tax rebate offered by Ann Arbor,
production was relocated - with
only four weeks of prep work
allowed. Though the production
team rushed to complete the
preparations, by a stroke of luck
four weeks was plenty of time,
according to Arteta.
This abrupt change was
taken in stride by the director,
who regarded the shift as just
another difficulty to overcome,
displaying a resiliant trait evi-
dent throughout the events
in Artera's life. Despite being
expelled from high school in
Costa Rica, he moved to Boston
to complete his schooling and
subsequently made his way to
Harvard, where he met and fell
in love with filmmaking, before

eventually leaving for Wesley-
an. After graduating from that
institution, he earned a Student
Academy Award for his film
"Every Day is a Beautiful Day."
He then attended the American
Film Institute, where he earned
his MFA in 1993.
Two years in the making,
"Cedar Rapids" represents a
mishmash of Midwestern val-
ues, hypocrisy and Arteta's own
life philosophy. He is a man who
believes in what the Midwest
stands for, having fun with it but
"never making fun" of it, he said,
and defending it when necessary.
For example, Arteta pointed out
that Iowa accepts gay marriage
and voted to elect President
Barack Obamayet still bears the
brunt of jokes about Midwestern
conventionalism from so-called
"liberal" states like California.
Arteta's love and respect for the
oft-ridiculed Midwest is evident
in his view of the film and the
script as a whole.
"What affected me about the
script is that it told the story of
how you can be kind but not be a
chump," Arteta said. "That's the
kind of people I'm looking for in
my life and that's what I'm aim-
ing for myself."
Thanks to Miguel Arteta and
his philosophy, perhaps "Cedar
Rapids" will bring some glory
and respect back to the Mid-
western slice of the country that
we call home, while sending a
positive message in the process.

So indie it gives you a headache.

While this might seem deriva-

the "Magicka" combat system
makes the game feel novel and
refreshing.
"Magicka" puts the player in
the role of a wizard and provides
different elements that the play-
er can combine to make spells.
These elements - relegated to
the left side of the QWERTY
keyboard - can be combined in
all sorts of ways. For example,
combining rock and fire cre-
ates a fireball. Combining rock,
freeze and shield will create a
half circle of rocks that sprout
up to shield the player and
freezes any enemy that comes in
contact with them. When going
off the beaten path, players will
often find "spell books" that
give information about more
advanced spells, like the ability
to create a blizzard or tempo-
rarily slow down time. Players

They were a preseason No. 2 team. They were return

of the year in senior Kalin Lucas. They were coming off
an NCAA Tournament Final Four appearance. They
were going to contend for the National Championship.
Michigan was a preseason nobody. A team devoid of
star talent. A team that saw no postseason last year. A
team nobody saw as a threat during the preseason this
year. They were goingto contend for respect.
Who could have expected that the Michigan men's
basketball would not only sweep Michigan State dur-
ing the 2010-11 season, but beat the Spartans 70-63 in a
game with NCAA Tournament hopes on the line?
The Wolverines (9-9 Big Ten, 19-12 overall) led by a4

when Michigan led by just four.
The Spartans (9-9,17-13) used a mix of defensive pres-'
sures to try to get themselves back into the game. Lucas
cut the lead to four with a minute and a half remaining
after he drained a 3-pointer following a time out. Michi-
gan State coach Tom Izzo promptly called another time
out and the Spartans set up in a full court man-to-mark
press.

Wolverines fall to last-place Illini in Big Ten tournament

By KEVIN RAFERTY
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - Prior to
the Michigan women's basketball
team's 55-47 loss to Illinois on
Friday, Illi- ILLINOIS 5
nois coach MICHIGAN 47
Jolette Law
stressed the importance of com-
ing out strong in the first five min-
utes of the game.
"Coach always preaches first
five minutes," Illinois junior
guard Lydia McCully said after
the Illini's first round win over
Wisconsin. "When you come out
like that, there's no way to go but

strong."
Mission accomplished, Coach.
Five minutes into the game, the
last-place Fighting Illini - who
lost 12 straight games prior to the
Big Ten Tournament - led 10-2,
and the third-seeded Wolver-
ines (10-7 Big Ten, 17-12 overall)
couldn't buy a bucket.
"It was extremely important
(to start off the game strong),"
Law said after the game. "I knew
what we were looking for, I knew
Michigan was going to come out
and probably be aggressive."
Illinois (4-14, 9-22) never
trailed, and the Fighting Illini
became the first-ever 11 seed to

make it to the tournament semi-
finals.
And things only got worse for
Michigan after the first five min-
utes. By the time the first-half
buzzer sounded, Illinois had all
but run the Wolverines out of
Conseco Field House with a 37-16
lead - the Illini's biggest halftime
lead of the year.
"Any time you're not doing well
on the offensive end of the court,
the other team's offense does real-
ly well;" Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "The more you
struggle offensively, the better the
other team's offense works. That
was what, in my opinion, it came

down to."
Sixteen points was the few-
est that Michigan has scored in a
half this season. Illinois forward
and Detroit native Amber Moore
nearly equaled Michigan's point
total with 14 first-half points.
The Wolverines shot an atro-
cious 13.3 percent from behind
the arc, and just 26.9 percent from
the field. The Fighting Illini, on
the other hand, shot 44.4 percent
from behind the are and over 51
percent from the field - more
than 10 percent higher than their
season average in both categories.

Last season, the Michigan
hockey team had the "horses to
get into the race," but as assistant
coach Mel Pearson described last
Thursday, the team just was a lit-
tle behind at the finish line.
A year removed from their
CCHA Tournament title, the
Wolverines are still "knocking
on the door," according to Pear-
son, and the tools to finally break
down the door and grab Michi-
gan's first NCAA championship
since 1998 are present once again
in Ann Arbor.
"There's been a lot of those
years where you feel you have a
chance, and you have the team
capable of winning it, and then
from that point, a lot of things
have to fall into place," Pearson
said. "But are we due? We're
probably due ... Now, do we have
the right players, in the right
frame of mind?
"This time of year, we're right
there again. When you look at
it, are there teams out there you
just can't beat? I don't think
that's the case."
Since the beginning of the
calendar year, the Wolverines
have an 11-4 conference record,
sweeping five-of-seven weekend
series, an impressive statistic
considering they had swept just
two opponents - Bowling Green
and Lake Superior State - prior

to The Big Chill at the Big House
in mid-Dec.
Even with the team's 11th
CCHA regular season title to its
name - clinched over Northern
Michigan - senior co-captain
Carl Hagelin and Pearson reit-
erated similar sentiments: the
Wolverines still haven't reached
their top-end yet this.late in the
year.
"As a coach, you're trying to
get everybody's best game the
same night, and I don't know if
you're ever going to get that,"
Pearson said. "But that's what
you're trying to work toward.
We're getting closer. This time of
year seems to bring out the best
in our team ... There's something
different about this time of year.
Hopefully, last Saturday in Mar-
quette was just a sign of that."
Hagelin added that play-
ing sound defense as Michigan
heads into the second round of
the playoffs this upcoming week-
end at YostIce Arena is one of the
key ingredients to formulating a
deep run into the NCAA Tourna-
ment - the Wolverines are tied
for third in the CCHA, allowing
2.31 goals per game.
And though Hagelin and the
other six members of the current
senior class have reached the
Frozen Four just once, Michigan
head coach Red Berenson has
been there eight times during his
27 years on the bench.
Following the completion of

the Wolverines' sweep of North-
ern Michigan last weekend,
the team sang 'The Victors' in
the locker room and from the
post-game festivities, one could
see a very emotionally-charged
Berenson who normally is as
even keel as it gets.
"It's hard to see how much
Red cares sometimes because
he, keeps that straight face,"
senior forward Matt Rust said
last week. "But, I think from day
one, he's really expected a lot
from this team. I think he might
have a little special place for this
team."
Berenson turned 71 this past
December and is approaching
the last few seasons with the
Wolverines, but his commitment
to success hasn't wavered - he
signed a three-year contract
extension last May, which will
keep. him at Michigan through
the 2012-13 season.
"It's like this team is his baby
Hagelin said about Berenson's
love for Michigan. ,"He loves
every player that comes through
here. He just tries to develop us
as much as possible, and obvi-
ously anytime you can win some-
thing, it's a huge accomplishment
for him and the team.
"He says when the team is
playing well, it's not because of
the coach, that's when all the
players are clicking. That's the
goal we still have to reach."

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Freshman guard Tim Hardaway has helped Michigan all but assure itself a
NCAA Tournament or NIT bid.

Something happened when
Michigan left the building with
its first win in almost 14 years
in East Lansing.
The Wolverines started to
look like a Tournament team.
Sure, Michigan may have lost
three games since then.
But a closer look shows one
loss to the nation's top team
(Michigan led at half) and two
heartbreakers with the game
winding down (against Wiscon-
sin and Illinois).
There are few teams outside
of the NCAA's elite that can
claim a better end to the season
than the Wolverines can.
And now, with only the Big
Ten Tournament remaining,
there are few bubble teams that
can make a better case to stay
on the right side of the bubble
than the Wolverines can.
Michigan will face Illinois
on Friday to sweeten their
resum6 and show their late-
season prowess in the Big Ten
Tournament.
But if you ask me, the Wol-
verines have already done
enough to earn that coveted
bid, one that looked so impos-
sible, so unlikely just four
months ago.
The NCAA Selection Com-

mittee may put an awful lot
of credence into the idea of
big-time wins. And Michigan
doesn't exactly shock the world
when it comes to that category.
But the Wolverines' late-
season run, sandwiched by
two impressive victories over
the Spartans, showed that this
team is on the upswing.
Put this team up against the
same Syracuse, Ohio State,
Kansas, Wisconsin and Purdue
teams that they played and nar-
rowly lost to earlier in the sea-
son, and I'm not so sure we'd
see the same result.
And if that's not on the com-
mittee's mind, then the integ-
rity of the entire group should
be questioned.
Because now with the regu-
lar season over, it's obvious that
we were ALL wrong about this
Michigan.
And it would be an awful
shame if the committee makes
the same mistakes we made in
judging the Wolverines before
the season.

Preparing people to lead extraordinary lives

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - The Michi-
gan women's basketball team has
a fairly simple offensive game
plan that it tries
to execute every NOTEBOOK
game.
The Wolverines depend on get-
ting the ball into the key, whether
it is by their slashing guards or
working it into the post, and then
either finishing from down low or
dishing the ball out to their tal-
ented outside shooters.
Night in and night out, Michi-
gan relies on its outside shooting
either to score or to get the ball
into the post.
Against Illinois on Friday, the
Wolverines couldn't do either
effectively, which eventually
doomed them against a team with
the worst record in the Big Ten.
Even though Michigan played
solid defense, it never found
offensive rhythm from anywhere
on the court. Despite getting plen-
ty of open looks, the Wolverines
couldn't capitalize consistently.
Whether in the post, perimeter
or midrange, it didn't matter -
Michigan simply couldn't find the
net.
"We were getting some good
looks, and the people we wanted
to shoot were shooting it and they
weren't falling for us," senior
guard Veronica Hicks said after
the game. "They were making

shots and we weren't."
The Wolverines shot just 37
percent from the floor, includ-
ing 27 percent from beyond the
3-point line. After a certain point,
the Fighting Illini could relax a
little more around the perimeter,
knowing Michigan was having
trouble making shots. That led to
more pressure inside, making it
very difficult for the Wolverine
frontcourt to execute in the paint.
Perhaps the Wolverine play-
er most affected by the Illinois
defense was sophomore forward
Rachel Sheffer. When Michigan
played Illinois last Sunday, Shef-
fer scored 23 points, including the
game-winning layup. This time
around, she scored just six points
and was shut down by a stiff
defense all game.
"They gave it to me when I was
open, and when I started making
a move I just saw my other players
wide open around the 3," Sheffer
said. "It just came down to hitting
shots and we weren't making any
of them."
TOURNAMENT HOPES: Mich-
igan went into the game against
Illinois- feeling very confident
about their NCAA Tournament
chances. Win one game, and
the Wolverines would be all but
guaranteed a bid to play in March
Madness. Instead, Michigan will
head into Selection Monday on
March 14 unsure of its chances to
go dancing.
Historically, the top four seeds

in the Big Ten have typically
been given a bid, but usually all
four seeds have 20 or more wins.
Michigan finished the regular
season third in the Big Ten with
just 17 wins after it won a three-
way tiebreaker.
"It is what it is, we put our fate
in the hands of somebody else and
from here you just wait and see -
you hope for the best and expect
the worse," sophomore Jenny
Ryan said. "We want to meet our
goal of the NCAA Tournament
and in my heart, I'm confident,
but it's in the hands of somebody
else at this point."
INCONSISTENCY: Michigan
has plenty of wins against good
teams, but they also have a couple
of losses against bad teams. If the
Wolverines do not end up making
the NCAA Tournament, key loss-
es against bad teams will come
back to haunt them.
Michigan went an astounding
5-0 against the fourth- (Iowa),
fifth- (Ohio State), and sixth-place
(Wisconsin) teams in the Big Ten,
which gave them the third-place
tiebreaker. Those wins were piv-
otal for the Wolverines, but a few
important losses could have more
meaning for the postseason.
Along with Thursday's loss
against Illinois, they also lost to
conference bottom-feeder Min-
nesota twice. Before the Big Ten
season began, Michigan lost to
Detroit Mercy, who finished 6-11
in the Horizon League.

With Hardaway Jr. and
junior guard Stu Douglass,
who played despite beingsick,
scoreless in the first half, the
Wolverines had to rely on a
few other sources, includ-
ing freshman forward Evan
Smotrycz, who scored nine
first-half points coming off
the bench.
After redshirt freshman
Jordan Morgan got into foul
trouble midway through the
second half, Michigan coach
John Beilein moved Smotrycz
into the five spot to face up
against Michigan State's
6-foot-8 junior forward Del-
von Roe.
But on the defensive end, it
was Michigan's weakside help
defense that forced the Spar-
tans to take low-percentage
shots and helped the Wolver-
ines force 10 Michigan State
turnovers.
Even with the size dispar-
ity in the post throughout the
game, the Wolverines out-

scored the Spartans 26-20 in
the paint. But Michigan State
hit the glass harder, out-
rebounding Michigan by 16.
With the Wolverines' win,
Michigan is in a four-way tie
for fourth place in the confer-
ence, but due to tiebreakers, it
will play as the No. 5 seed in
the Big Ten Tournament. It
was, arguably,theWolverines'
most pressure-driven game of
the year.But Michigan held its
composure in front of a sold-
out Crisler Arena.
"We knew what was on the
line with sweeping Michigan
State and the Big Ten implica-
tions - rankings and the Big
Ten Tournament and stuff,"
Douglass said. "You can't deny
that you knew that as a player,
but we tried to approach it the
same as every game."
And while the team has
proved it was able to move
on from its continual close
losses, the No. 5 seed in the
Big Ten Tournament and the
hype of a rivalry - one that
had seemed stale for so long
- proves the resilience of
Beilein's squad.

"At the beginning of the
year we had good success, in
the Big Ten (season) we hit a
rough patch but we all knew
what we were capable of,"
Douglass said. "When we got
a win we weren't getting on
our knees and thanking the
heavens, we knew what we
were capable of, competing
with anybody."
But after Michigan lost
to then-No. 12 Wisconsin on
Feb. 23, many assumed the
Wolverines' tournament bub-
ble hopes had finally popped,
predicting that the young
team had finally hit its final
straw.
"It's the coach's job to get
them to move on," Beilein
said after the game. "We've
had so many close games just
like this one this year that we
didn't get. We've won a lot of
games that were just like this,
so we're .500, but the one's
you remember are the Kan-
sas game and the game with
Wisconsin. You can't let them
hang in there - you have 30
games.
"You have to move on."

ALTERCATION
From Page 1B
gan coach John Beilein said
he didn't see the incident, as
he was already heading to the
handshake line, and that he
would look into it. The two
players also later downplayed
the confrontation.
Most will probably just
remember the altercation
going forward, but Lucas's
second-half performance
can't be overlooked. The
senior went 3-for-5 from
deep and was a perfect 8-for-
8 from the free throw line in
the half.
And it seemed like every
shot he hit was big, either
stopping a Wolverine run
before it could take off, or
building momentum for his
own team.
Lucas scored nine straight
points for Michigan State
shortly after the bregk to keep
his team in the game, and his
two free throws with 5:48
remaining cut the deficit to
just two points at 56-54 - the
closestthe Spartans would get
the rest of the game.
"He's got his quickness
back now," sophomore guard

Matt Vogrich said. "He's real-
ly quick, and he's playing at
the rate he played at (in2008-
09) when he was Player of the
Year in the conference. He's
tough to stop."
Lucas's final campaign has
been somewhat of a disap-
pointment. Picked as Pre-
season Big Ten Player of the
Year, he won't even be First
Team All-Big Ten in a season
marked by his return from a
torn Achilles tendon.
But Lucas still came into
Saturday's game averaging
16.7 points per game, and
as freshman forward Evan
Smotrycz pointed out after
the contest, Lucas spearhead-
ed Michigan State's charge in
the teams' initial meeting on
Jan. 27, also leading all scor-
ers then with 27 points.
And Lucas has a his-
tory of making clutch shots,
including the game-winning
jumper at Crisler Arena last
season.
So it was no surprise that
Izzo put the ball in his point
guard's hands to lead the
comeback effort. In the sec-
ond half, the Spartan offense
consisted mostly of weave
action at the top of the key fol-
lowed by a ball screen, lead-

ing to Lucas penetrating or,
sometimes, him getting open
by running off a screen away
from the ball.
"Coach Izzo started calling
a lot of plays just for him, try-
ing to get everybody involved
to get him open shots," Morris
said. "With a player like that...
he's just a great player, and he
made shots."
Lucas's shots were usually
challenged, too, but fell any-
way. Earlier in the season,
the Wolverines may have got-
ten rattled in the face of such
an onslaught, but ultimately,
they kept their composure
and held on to win.
Saturday may have rep-
resented a changing of the
guard in the Big Ten point
guard hierarchy, with Lucas
exiting and Morris only ris-
ing. But it was also proof of
Michigan's new maturity. The
veteran Lucas - playing with
teammates with Final Four
experience - had been there
before, but still couldn't pull
off the win.
"At this point in the sea-
son, there's no freshmen any-
more," junior guard/forward
Zack Novak said. "Every-
body's got experience. The
guys handled it great."

days later was blown out by Big
Ten basement dweller Indiana
- at times, things are becoming
clearer to me.
It's those pain staking,
rip-your-eyes-out-of-the-
sockets-and-then-step-on-them
moments, which make the Wol-
verines that much more beauti-
ful to watch now:
Yes, and I do mean beauti-
ful (even more beautiful than
Evan Smotrycz's gelled hair on
Saturday). Beilein's offense has
taken a year, a six-game losing
streak, and a few buzzer beat-
ers to morph into the beautiful
butterfly it has become (Tim
Doyle would love that analogy).
But the wait is so worth it for
any Michigan fan. It all came in
the Wolverines 70-63 win over
Michigan State on Saturday.
It was Michigan's first sweep
of the Spartans in more than a
decade. The Wolverines did it in
their last regular season game of
the year. They did it at home and
they did it in a game which fea-
tured two teams both fightingto
stay alive in the NCAA Tourna-
ment hunt.
Beilein's offense finally looked
crisp. The Wolverines out-
smarted the Spartans, used their
intelligence to top a team that
is arguably more athletic and
forced a program that has too
many times dominated Michi-
gan to beat itself.
Indiana coach Tom Crean said
at the beginning ofthe season
that there's nothing more diffi-
cult than preparing for a Beilein-
coached team. Well, Crean's
assumption looked pretty silly
when his Hoosiers obliterated
the Wolverines, 80-61 on Jan. 15
and Michigan cruised to a 1-6
start to its Big Ten schedule.
But things started to change.
Jordan Morgan finally figured
out that after he sets his back
screens for Darius Morris he
has to roll, Morris learned that
when he drives there are three
open guards on the perimeter
and everyone watched as Matt
Vogrich started getting open

backdoor looks because teams
play the perimeter too aggres-
sively in the zone, attempting to
stop Michigan's shooters.
The Wolverines, and everyone
who watches them, finally wit-
nessed Beilein's clever offensive
tricks pay off.
Against Michigan State on
Saturday, Michigan was fouled
three times from 3-point range.
That's because when play-
ers like Morris or Hardaway Jr.
drive off Morgan's screen, two
players are left open in 3-point
land. So Michigan State players
like forward Draymond Green
have to lunge over to the arc just
to get a hand in Zack Novak's
face. Then Green can't control
his momentum and he finds
himself fouling outof the game
with two minutes remaining.
Michigan is a team that prides
itself on its 3-point shooting.
Teams are completely aware of
that. What they aren't aware
of is how to stop a team that is
shooting wide open 3-pointers
- a product of the way Beilein
runs his offense.
Even at times when the Wol-
verines' shots are just off, Michi-
gan's offense can get it done. The
roster essentially puts the Wol-
verines' opponents in complete
mismatches on all five guards.
You've got Morris who is the
tallest point guard in the league,
Novak who is being defended by
players like Green, who are big-
ger and-slower than he is, and
Morgan who's being covered by
guys who may statistically be
larger, but can't keep up with his
allusiveness and quickness.
When the players don't fully
know and understand Beilein's
blueprint, a pass to an open
Novak atthe wing will instead
bounce off Blake McLiman's
forehead and roll out of bounds
(as it did on Saturday).
But when the players do
understand Beilein's system,
a freshman like Hardaway Jr.
will notch all 20 of his points in
a second half against a rival in
front of a sell-out crowd.
That's not disgusting. That's
beautiful.

Sophomore point guard Darius Morris scored 13 points, five rebounds and six assists on Saturday.

took them too lightly," sopho-
more guard Jenny Ryan said.
"I just think we couldn't hit
shots. When it comes down to
it, they hit their shots and we
didn't, and that was the differ-
ence in the first half. We got
the looks we wanted."
And for Michigan, whose
turnover-to-assist ratio was
second in the nation before
Friday's game, it looked like
the ball was covered in bacon
grease for much of the first
half, as it ended the frame
with 16 turnovers and 12
assists.
But even after facing the
teams' largest first-half deficit
of the year, Borseth remained

positive in the locker room.
"No goal was too deep,"
Michigan forward Kate
Thompson said about Bors-
eth's halftime message. "We
can always come back from
this."
And in the second half, they
came out looking like it.
The Wolverines came out
on a9-2 run to start the frame,
cutting the lead to 14.
"Just take it at them, chip
away atthat lead, and our goal
was to get within 10 points
and never give up and keep
fighting," sophomore guard
Jenny Ryan said. "We all just
kind of bought into that."
Even after the lead bal-
looned back up to 24 after a
jumper byIllinois guard Adri-
enne GodBold with nine min-
utes to go, Michigan refused

to give up.
And after a layup by sopho-
more forward Sam Arnold
with just over three minutes
to play, the Wolverine's finally
cut the lead to single digits.
"I definitely thought
we had a chance (to win),"
Thompson said. "We just had
to get a couple big threes and
get some more stops. They
couldn't really handle our
zone at the end."
But it was all too little, too
late. A seven-point deficit
with a minute to go was the
closest Michigan got.
And with no other chances
to prove themselves to the
NCAA Tournament com-
mittee, all the Wolverines
can do is-hope that they've
done enough to get to the Big
Dance.

You should feel sorry for
Schilling and Mouton

BASEBALL
M' notches first wins,
but struggles continue

INDIANAPOLIS -
Steve Schilling sat there
taking questions maybe
for the last time about
all the garbage - Rich Rodri-
guez, the 24-26 record Schil-
ling endured in four seasons at
Michigan, the
drama.
Garbage.
But this
time, the
questions
weren't about
the team
anymore. The TIM
fifth-year ROHAN
senior and
captain of
the 2010 football team already
answered those questions week
in and week out. After games -
good and obscenely bad - Schil-
ling spoke-like the team leader
he was. He even stood up at the
podium on most Monday after-
noons for press conferences,
playing with his feet the same
way Rodriguez would, pushing
his toes into the ground.
It was hard to be comfortable,
but he always faced the music.
Now, sitting at table No. 5,
surrounded by a handful of
reporters at the NFL Scout-
ing Combine, he was asked not
about the team, but about him-
self.
Even though you've graduated,
would you like to stay another
year at Michigan to see how
things play out?
Schilling responded with a
company line - he thought next
year's senior class would do a
fine job with the transition.
But that's not exactly what
the reporter was getting at.
What about what Steve wants?
As Schilling walked away, the
reporter clarified.
Would.a little part ofyou
like toplay another year, just to
play without all of that constant
drama?
Now Schilling opened up.
"It's tough to play with those
distractions," he said. "It wears
on you, even if you're not think-
ing about it. Part of me last year
was consciously just trying to
tell myself to have fun playing -
enjoy it.It was my senior year,
try to avoid all of the distrac-
tions."
So, what about another year?
"It would be nice."
For Schilling and fifth-year
senior linebacker Jonas Mouton
- Michigan's two lonely rep-
resentatives at this year's com-
bine - how could you not feel
sorry for those two guys? And
any other member of this senior

Fifth-year senior Steve Schilling was projected by ESPN's Todd McShay to be a day-three pick in April's NFL Draft.

class exiting Michigan during
such a low point in the football
program's history.
Schilling and Mouton both
came from the West Coast -
Schilling from Washington and
Mouton from California - and
left Pac-10 country to come to
Ann Arbor to play for Lloyd
Carr, to play in a pro-style
offense and a 4-3 defense, to
compete for championships -
not Gator Bowl trophies.
But alas, here they were,
five years removed from their
redshirt season when they
watched Michigan battle Ohio
State in the No. 1 vs. No. 2 game.
Then they sat by as their team-
mates played USC in the Rose
Bowl. That was what they were
going to be a part of. They were
recruited to be the next in line
and chosen to fill those cookie-
cutter roles that were the NFL's
training ground for years.
Then, everything changed.
Carr left and so did the NFL-
ready schemes he coached.-
Rodriguez brought a style of
play that won him games at West
Virginia, but it didn't garner
a reputation of being an NFL
pipeline.
Transitioning from Rodri-
guez's spread-option offense or
3-3-5 defense to the NFL is like
an improv actor trying to make
the jump to Broadway. They
may have the ability to do it, and
both involve acting. Some of the
skills translate, but it's not the
same.

NFL coaches and general
managers alike will tell you,
there are enough colleges run-
ning those types of schemes
that they have to adjust how
they evaluate players - but they
never know for sure ifa player
will make the adjustment.
So in Indianapolis, Schilling
and Mouton had to make their
cases - that Schilling could be
a bulldozer rather than just a
guard who can play in space and
that Mouton could be a physical
linebacker in the 4-3. Both of
them had the same answer for
teams.
Just pop in my freshman year
tape, when Iplayedfor coach
Carr.
How unusual - as if the past
three years were for naught.
But the past three years did
have an effect - a negative one.
Twenty-two losses is a lot for
a school like Michigan to pile
up. ESPN's director of college
football scouting for Scouts Inc.,
-Todd McShay, put it like this:
What comes first, the chicken or
the egg?
Was Michigan so bad because
only two players were worthy
of invites to the NFL Combine?
Or were there only two players
invited because Michigan was
so bad?
Teams pay attention to
whether or not your team had
success. Everyone wants to be
around winners.
"They're just around a cer-
tain atmosphere," said Seattle

Seahawks G.M. John Schneider.
"They come in with a certain
level of confidence and prepara-
tion and professionalism."
Added Denver Broncos G.M.
Brian Xanders: "We want win-
ners. We want people that love
football."
Anyone who's been a part of
the Michigan program for the
past three seasons can't claim to
be a winner and keep a straight
face.
The past three years might
have gone as badly as it possibly
could have for Schilling and
Mouton's draft stock, consider-
ing everything but their indi-
vidual play.
That's the saddest part. None
of this was in Schilling's or
Mouton's control: Carr's depar-
ture, playing outside of their
strong-suits and adapting to
Rodriguez's schemes, the losing
and the drama that choked the
program.
They stayed with Michigan,
took their lumps and look where
it got them - McShay said the
losing culture probably would
drop their stock a round or two
in the draft.
At this point, of course it
would. Here's hoping Schilling
and Mouton catch a break at the
next level.
They've dealt with more
than their fair share of garbage
already.

Daily Sports Writer
If the Michigan baseball team
could face Massachusetts in
every game, it'd be in good shape.
But the Wolverines (2-9 over-
all) have other competition. And
last week Sam Houston State
- the host of the Bearkat Invi-
tational in Huntsville, Texas -
taught Michigan that the hard
way.
The Wolverines snapped their
season-opening, seven-game los-
ing streak with a win Fridayover
the Minutemen, 5-2. Later that
night, the Bearkats quickly hum-
bled Michigan with an 11-3 win.
On Saturday, the Wolverines
again knocked around UMass,
winning 11-6, but Sunday, Sam
Houston State shut out Michi-
gan,8-0.
"We just went on a trip and
played nine games in seven days
and on top of that, unfortunately,
two of our pitchers who are sup-
posed to be starters (senior right-
handers Kolby Wood and Travis
Smith) pitched only a couple of
innings in the beginning of the
trip (last weekend), and then
couldn't pitch at all (this week-
end) due to injuries," Michigan
coach Rich Maloney said. "That
was a bigblow, and that set every-
thing else back tremendously."
The Bearkats (9-2) silenced
the Wolverines' bats on Sunday.
Despite giving up just one run
and one hit in 3.2 innings, fresh-
man right-hander Alex Lakatos
was credited with the loss. His
pitch count was limited after he
made a relief appearance Satur-
day.
Just two days after sophomore
left-hander Bobby Brosnahan,
Michigan's ace, was chased in
the second inning of a Friday
start against Sam Houston State,
Brosnahan made a rare relief
appearance Sunday. Coming out.
of the bullpen proved no bet-
ter for the lefty, who went 2.2
innings, but again found little
success, giving up seven earned
runs on nine hits.
"We've got to get Bobby Bros-
nahan back to pitching like he
did last year, when he was a solid
pitcher for us and a mainstay
in the rotation," Maloney said.
"He's just struggling out of the
gate mentally and we've got to
get him going again, because we
really could use him."
The bats showed flashes of
brilliance on Saturday, as the
Wolverines scored 11 runs off the
Minutemen (0-4) on 15 hits.
Michigan once again got solid
production out of the top of its

lineup - one of the Wolverines'
few brightspots this season.
Sophomore shortstop Derrick
Dennis and freshman left fielder
Michael O'Neill each had three
hits and two RBI to lead Michi-
gan, which got a hit out of every
starter. Dennis also had two*
steals.
O'Neill, batting .386, has a hit
in each game this season.
"I've been extremely
impressed with (O'Neill)," said
sophomore center fielder Patrick
Biondi. "He's definitely someone
who has exceeded expectations
and he's been doing really well,
so I'm happy for him and I hope
he continues to produce like
that."
In the Friday nightcap against
the Bearkats, Brosnahan went
just I-plus innings, giving up
three runs. Junior right-hander
Ryan Kopf and redshirt senior
right-hander Matt Gerbe com-
bined to go 1.2 innings, and
allowed six runs, as the over-
worked bullpen continued to
struggle after short outings from
its starters.
Redshirt senior second base-
ment Anthony Toth led the Wol-
verines offensively with two hits
and two runs and O'Neil added
two steals to his team-leading
five.
Michigan's first game of the
weekend was highlighted by red-
shirt sophomore right-hander
Tyler Mills pitching a strong
7.1 innings in his second career
start. Mills, who Maloney called
an 'X-factor' enteringthe season,
gave up just one earned run to
garner the win.
"We're really, really excited
about Tyler Mills," Maloney
said. "He's had two starts now
and one relief appearance in his
whole collegiate career, and he's
showing signs of giving us great
hope ... He's been pretty electric.
(Mills and Lakatos) are going to
give us two really solid arms."
With any chance of earn-
ing an at-large bid likely out the
window, the Wolverines have to
look to expand on the flashes of
potential they've shown thus far
heading into Big Ten play, which
begins in three weeks.
"There's a lot of season left,"
O'Neil said. "People can sit there
and say, 'You're 2-8, you're not
going to be any good,' but the Big
Ten season hasn't even started.
We're 0-0 in the Big Ten. Ulti-
mately, our pre-Big Ten schedule
is to get us ready for the Big Ten.
There's some people who are
going to question us, obviously,
but we've got to stick together as
a team."

"I don't really keep track of
