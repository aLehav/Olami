The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
student 
body 
president and vice president 
released a statement Monday 
denouncing the University’s 
decision to grant tenure to 
David 
Daniels, 
professor 
in 
the 
School 
of 
Music, 
Theatre & Dance, in light of 
recent allegations of sexual 
assault made against him by 
multiple University students. 
The statement also affirms 
Central Student Government 
support 
for 
survivors 
on 
campus.
“When 
the 
normal 
institutional processes fail, 

we, as leaders of CSG, have 
a responsibility to hold the 
University’s 
administration 
accountable,” the statement, 
signed 
by 
CSG 
President 
Daniel 
Greene 
and 
Vice 
President Isabel Baer, reads.
Many 
individuals 
have 
come forward with sexual 
assault 
allegations 
against 
Daniels, some cases dating 
back as early as 2010. Most 
recently, 
Music, 
Theatre 
and Dance School graduate 
student 
Andrew 
Lipian 
filed 
a 
lawsuit 
against 
Daniels on Oct. 24 and cited 
inaction pertaining to his 
case.

Veterans, 
their 
families 
and 
supportive 
attendees 
gathered at Hill Auditorium 
at the University of Michigan 
Monday evening to listen to 
five veterans share stories 

about their time in active 
duty and life after service. 
The event, dubbed “Stories 
of Service,” was organized 
by Fisher House Foundation, 
a 
veteran 
nonprofit, 
and 
was sponsored by Michigan 
Medicine.
“Stories of Service” is a 
night to honor those who 

have served in the military 
and to call attention to the 
importance 
of 
supporting 
veterans and their families. 
The 
ceremony 
included 
storytelling from the five 
veterans and performances by 
Concordia University’s choir 
and wind ensemble.
Speakers at the ceremony 

represented 
multiple 
generations, 
including 
96-year-old World War II 
veteran Guy Stern, a Jewish 
immigrant who fled Germany 
to escape the Nazi regime. 
Stern spoke about his time as 
a member of a special military 
intelligence unit in the U.S. 

SnoHub, an app for on-demand 
snow 
removal 
services, 
is 
arriving in Ann Arbor this 
winter after a successful season 
on the East Coast. The Uber-like 
service connects homeowners 
who need snow removed from 
their driveways to contractors 
with trucks, plows or even just 
shovels willing to clear snow 
during their free time.
SnoHub CEO James Albis, 
a 
Connecticut-native, 
said 
he came up with the idea 
for 
SnoHub 
after 
negative 
experiences dealing with snow 
removal, more particularly with 
snow removal services. While 
some homeowners shovel their 
own snow, others choose to hire 
a snow removal contractor who 
likely has equipment like snow 
blowers, winter service vehicles 
or plows to clear snow from 
driveways, roofs, sidewalks and 
decks. But Albis found some 
problems 
with 
the 
system, 
including a lack of reliability 
and transparency and the need 
to pay in cash or check.

Statewide candidates make final push in Ann Arbor on eve of general election

On the eve of the 2018 midterm 
elections, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats held a pre-election 
rally to encourage students and 
citizens to vote on Tuesday. 

There were several featured 
speakers, including current U.S. 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., 
who is up for reelection this 
year.
Addressing 
about 
100 
attendees at the event, Stabenow 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of voting ethically, claiming 
an increase in seats won by 

Democrats could make this 
happen.
“We are committed to a 
country that reflects the right 
values, and we reject what has 
been spewing out of the White 
House,” Stabenow said.
Stabenow echoed a sentiment 
that 
was 
common 
among 
other speakers — Democrats 

are looking for change in the 
upcoming election. U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, 
Jocelyn Benson, candidate for 
Michigan Secretary of State, and 
Sam 
Bagenstos, 
candidate 
for justice on the Michigan 
Supreme Court, all spoke of 
the opportunity this election

As part of their VOTE! 
2018 initiative, the University 
of 
Michigan 
Museum 
of 
Art partnered with SHEI 
Magazine, Bronze Elegance 
Fashion Show, NOiR Runway 
Fashion and enspiRED to 
put 
on 
a 
voting-themed 
fashion show Monday night. 
Also present were students 
from the Stamps School of 
Art and Design’s Voting is 
Sexy 
class 
and 
members 
from the Ginsberg Center 
for 
Community 
Service 

and 
Learning 
who 
were 
helping about 75 students 
in attendance come up with 
a voting plan for Tuesday’s 
election.
The 
show 
was 
the 
culmination of a series of 
events 
about 
voting 
and 
civic engagement that has 
been going on all fall at the 
museum. 
Lisa 
Borgsdorf, 
manager of Public Programs 
at UMMA, said she thought 
the fashion show was a great 
way to make voting fun.
“We were really thinking 
about motivation to go to 
the polls, and making it fun 
… (and) a way to do that that 

gets a lot of people here, and 
hopefully that translates to 
getting a lot of people to the 
polls,” Borgsdorf said. “It’s 
such a serious time, it’s such a 
big midterm election. It’s very 
important, but we also felt 
like there was room to have 
fun with it for the purpose of 
motivating people.”
LSA junior Sarah Jacob, 
a member of the UMMA 
Student Engagement Council, 
said she felt the fashion show 
was a great way to motivate 
people who were interested in 
the arts to vote. 
“I think it’s a really cool way 
to the keep the conversation 
going 
about 
voting,” 
Jacob said. “I think this 
is one of the years that 
I’ve heard people talk 
the most about midterm 
elections which has been 
crazy because that’s not 
usually the case, so I 
think adding a fashion 
show really brings in the 
arts, and forces people 
who don’t think they are 
political to just think 
about the fact that they 
should be voting.”
The show was split 
into two parts — the first 
focused on what to wear 
to the polls. The models 
walked the makeshift 
runway wearing jackets, 
scarves and jeans, all 
in fall hues. LSA senior 
Kamaaria Sanders, an 
executive board member 
of 
Bronze 
Elegance 
Fashion Show, said she 
thought 
fashion 
and 
politics 
were 
deeply 
related, 
even 
though 
people might not think 
about it.
“Fashion plays a huge 

role 
in 
politics,” 
Sanders 
said. “If you think about 
how people dress when they 
are politicians, they are very 
particular about what they 
pick, as we were particular 
about what we picked in the 
show, like the tones, even 
though it’s something you 
don’t really pay attention to.”
Engineering senior Lauren 
Huang, an executive board 
member of NOiR Runway 
Fashion, agreed with Sanders 
and said she felt fashion had a 
large influence over elections.
“Depending on what (a 
politician is) wearing, it will 
give you the vibe or tone of 
what they’re standing for, 
or what they’re trying to get 
at,” Huang said. “Sometimes, 
if someone’s not dressed the 
right way, you might not vote 
for them or not believe what 
they’re trying to say. But if 
they are dressed the right way 
and look very presentable, 
that 
will 
affect 
people’s 
opinions 
and 
their 
vote 
towards that person.”
The second section of the 
show was America themed, 
with models strutting down 
the runway in “I voted” and 
“voting is my superpower” 
T-shirts or more subtle red, 
white and blue looks, while 
Childish 
Gambino’s 
“This 
is America” played in the 
background.
After the models did their 
final walk, LSA senior Liv 
Velarde, 
editor-in-chief 
of 
SHEI Magazine, closed out the 
show by asking everyone in 
attendance to vote Tuesday. A 
bulk of University programming 
has focused on turning out 
students—only 14 percent of 
whom participated in the 2016 
presidential election.

CHRISTINE MONTALBANO/Daily

Through themes like fall fashion for the polls and America, the show urged 
students to vote on Tuesday, spoke on the connection between politics and the arts


“With the climate in the 
nation and here locally in 
Ann Arbor, we have seen an 
increased reporting of these 
interpersonal violence crimes, 
and we encourage increased 
reporting,” Burke said.
CSG also voted to fund 
bringing motivational speaker 
Brandon Farbstein to campus 
for an event titled “Ten Feet 
Tall.” Farbstein was diagnosed 
with 
metatropic 
dysplasia, 
a rare form of dwarfism, at 
age two. Business sophomore 
Paul Schmitz worked to bring 
Farbstein to the University, 
saying his story needed to be 

heard.
“He really has a story that 
resonates with every single 
person, and my goal is to get it 
to as many people as possible,” 
Schmitz said.
Farbstein speaks about his 
experience 
with 
depression, 
cyberbullying and life with 
his diagnosis to empower his 
audience. This semester, the 
University has placed more 
of an emphasis on equity and 
inclusion of disabled individuals 
on campus, creating a new slate 
of programming titled Investing 
in Ability.
CSG also passed a resolution 
to 
subsidize 
MDining 
gift 
cards during final exams. The 
resolution will provide a total 
of 150 cards, each good for one 
swipe, distributed over three 

days 
during 
exams. 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Drea 
Somers, 
co-author of the resolution, 
said the gift cards are “strongly 
recommended for Pell Grant 
students, but any student can 
pick it up.” The cards will not 
have an effect on financial aid.
At the end of the meeting, 
CSG 
passed 
a 
resolution 
that 
will 
require 
its 
representatives to attend one 
event hosted by organizations 
representing students of color 
each month. LSA senior Cece 
Huddleston wrote the resolution 
to 
serve 
underrepresented 
voices on campus.
“We are all at this school, 
and we are all Wolverines,” 
Huddleston said. “I just want 
us to get to know people outside 
of ourselves so we can truly 

represent the school and act the 
way we were elected to act.”
Finally, CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
read a statement denouncing the 
University’s response to sexual 
assault 
allegations 
against 
SMTD professor David Daniels. 
The council had no objection to 
the statement. 
“When 
the 
normal 
institutional 
processes 
fail, 
we, as leaders of CSG, have 
a responsibility to hold the 
University’s 
administration 
accountable,” 
the 
statement 
read. “We expect the University 
to 
respond 
appropriately 
to 
allegations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct. We will work to 
ensure that they do so.”

new homeowner, an existing 
homeowner, you’ve got a lot 
of things to attend to, one of 
those 
being 
snow-clearing, 
particularly if you live in a 
Snowbelt 
city,” 
Albis 
said. 
“When it comes to this type 
of service, you’re relying on 
a workforce that isn’t pretty 
business-savvy. 
There’s 
no 
rhyme or reason to how or when 
they show up. So even when you 
have a contract with them, the 
level of transparency is zero.”
Albis designed SnoHub as a 
mobile technology solution to an 
inefficient industry, comparing 
it to services like Airbnb or Uber. 
The company first targeted 
individuals with trucks and 
plows to be contractors, and is 
now looking to expand testing 
in the Midwest. One of his goals 
was to make sure customers 
can rely on SnoHub to send 
the appropriate workers and 
equipment, from students with 
shovels to snow plow businesses 
with trucks.
“As a contractor, this is part 
of your onboarding process,” 
Albis said. “You delineate what 
type of worker you are. So 
whether you’re a snow plower, 
shoveler, snow blower, you just 
tick that off and you take photos 
of whatever types of equipment 

you have, upload that to our 
backend and we’ll approve. 
Customers 
can 
order 
and 
specify that they don’t want a 
snow plow guy ripping up their 
lawn.”
Business sophomore Garrett 
Wilson works for SnoHub as 
its digital media director. He 
said SnoHub is now trying to 
recruit more contractors to 
supplement the high demand 
of homeowners. In particular, 
SnoHub is looking for shovelers 
to attend to smaller driveways 
unable to handle the huge plows 
of winter snow vehicles.
“We noticed last year that 
a lot of driveways weren’t 
exactly fit for a pickup and a 
plow a lot of times,” Wilson 
told The Daily. “You know, 
smaller driveways or smaller 
houses, they’re more fit for 
just somebody with a shovel. 
And additionally, it provides 
another way for us to get 
contractors to get into the 
SnoHub 
ecosystem, 
people 
that maybe are interested in 
the concept but don’t exactly 
have a pickup and a plow on 
them. What we introduced this 
year is SnoHub Shoveling. So 
say you’re a student, a college 
student at Michigan, you can 
sign on to the app. It literally 
takes five minutes and then 
you can accept jobs the same 
way that other contractors do.”
Wilson 
emphasized 
how 
easy the app is to navigate, and 

how the contractor job can be a 
great part-time gig for military 
veterans, firefighters or college 
students with free time.
“You’ll sign on and you’ll 
get job notifications from all 

around,” Wilson said. “And you 
can just accept the job and walk 
to the house or you Uber or you 
Bird or whatever you do. All 
you do is snap a before picture, 
you shovel, you snap an after 
picture, you get out of there and 
you get paid in three days. So it’s 
just another way for us to get 
more contractors involved and 

to suit customers’ needs better.”
LSA and Business junior 
Jennifer Chen thought SnoHub 
was an innovative venture, 
but 
wondered 
about 
the 
sustainability of the business 
during summer months when 
snow would not be a problem for 
homeowners.
“What are you going to 
do when there’s no one else 
requesting the service?” she 
asked.
Albis addressed a similar 
concern 
of 
sustainability, 
saying he intends to use the 
SnoHub platform to start other 
similar ventures.
“I have a pickup truck, but 
the utilization of the bed of 
that pickup truck is zero in 
the spring and the summer,” 
Albis said. “So we can use 
that, whether it’s to move a 
piece of artwork, move a piece 
of furniture across town, by 
using the same technical stack 
that we have right now for 
our app in the spring and the 
summer.”
Chen 
thought 
college 
students might find SnoHub 
attractive, especially as home 
renters. She pointed out how 
some students already use 
similar apps for other day-to-
day services.
“College students are busy 
and they don’t want to do it 
themselves, or they might not 
know the resources on how to 
get snow removed efficiently,” 

Chen said. “So maybe asking 
for the Uber-like service might 
be really helpful. And there’s 
already a lot of services that 
do laundry for them. I think 
college 
students 
are 
more 
interested in getting other 
people to do the work for 
them.”
On the other hand, Chen was 
unsure about whether or not 
the students she knew would 
want to work as contractors.
“I think there might be some 
interest but it would be a very 
minimal amount,” she said. 
“Because we’re also college 
students, we’re very busy. And 
there might be some liability 
involved, 
like, 
we’re 
also 
college students, we don’t want 
to obviously get hurt. And it’s a 
very time-consuming business 
... So I think it might be 
difficult to fit into a student’s 
schedule.”
Wilson, 
however, 
sees 
SnoHub and the contractor job 
as perfect for college students 
needing extra spending money, 
and who want to get involved 
in the gig economy.
Albis 
echoed 
Wilson, 
highlighting 
the 
increase 
in gig jobs and contractors 
in industries. For the snow 
removal business, he saw an 
opportunity for job creation 
for many to work in a field that 
doesn’t require a great amount 
of skill.

Army. Edie Meeks, another 
speaker 
at 
the 
ceremony, 
served as an Army nurse in 
the Intensive Care Units at a 
field hospital in Saigon during 
the 
Vietnam 
War. 
Meeks 
referred to her patients as “her 
boys,” emphasizing the close 
connection she shared with the 
soldiers.
The event was organized in 
to help fundraise and spread 
awareness for the creation of 
Michigan’s first Fisher House. 
Fisher House Foundation is a 
nonprofit organization aiming 
to 
build 
large 
communal 
homes next to military and VA 
medical centers for families of 
current military personnel and 
veterans to stay in at no cost 
while their family members are 
in the hospital. There are nearly 
80 Fisher Houses around the 
world, but there are currently 
none in Michigan.
Kate Melcher, co-host of the 
ceremony and former Apache 
helicopter pilot, said her own 
personal experiences with a 
Fisher House while her husband 
was in surgery were what led 
her to fight for construction of 
more. 
“It was my home from the 
moment that I crossed that 
threshold,” Melcher said. “We 
couldn’t do it for the generation 
that came back from Vietnam, 
but Fisher House Foundation 
has been doing this for the 

last quarter century and we’re 
going to continue it here in 
Michigan.”
Fisher House says it will 
open its first Michigan location 
in Ann Arbor in 2019, with a 
second opening shortly later in 
Detroit. The organization aims 
to raise $20 million for the 
construction and management 
of these houses.
Several 
of 
the 
speakers 
recounted their battles with 
post-traumatic stress disorder, 
mental health and loss. Army 
veteran 
Melissa 
Raulerson 
illustrated how being a member 
of 
the 
military 
community 
helped her cope with mental 
health issues upon discharge, 
saying 
organizations 
like 
Fisher House, which facilitate 
communal 
support 
among 
military 
families, 
were 
necessary for people like her.
“I went on to lead a small 
group of wives called Wives of 
Warriors,” Raulerson said. “We 
became a family. It was there 
that I learned the meaning of 
thriving and not just surviving.”
LSA junior Michael Koch said 
the event helped to increase 
awareness 
and 
support 
for 
Fisher Houses in Michigan by 
showing people what they were 
supporting.
“When you add a face and a 
story to a cause, it makes it a lot 
more personal,” Koch said.

positions

the state and the federal 
level.
Instead 
of

on 
discussing 
their 
platforms 
specifically, 
these 
candidates 
all 
emphasized 
the 
importance of actually 
getting 
out 
the 
vote. 
Several 
candidates 
mentioned 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
won 
Michigan by a margin 
of 0.3 percent in 2016 
— only 2.2 votes per 
precinct 
could 
have 
swung the election in the 
other direction.
The 
University 
has 
been 
urging 
students 
to 
vote 
for 
months 
leading up to Tuesday. 
Last 
September, 
the 

University joined the Big 
Ten Voting Challenge, a 
competition among Big 
Ten schools to improve 
voter 
registration 
and 
turnout numbers.
Candidates urged the 
audience to encourage 
everyone they knew to 
vote. State Rep. Yousef 
Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, said 
his personal experience in 
his first campaign in 2010 
— which he won by two 
votes — showed him no 
vote is insignificant. 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Kellie 
Lounds, 
chair 
of 
College 
Democrats, 
cited several other large 
campus events that were 
geared 
toward 
getting 
students 
involved 
in 
politics and encouraging 
them to vote, including 
a rally with gubernatorial 
candidate 
Gretchen 
Whitmer early in the year 
and a more recent rally 
that featured U.S. Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
However, when asked 

about 
the 
University’s 
role 
in 
encouraging 
students to vote through 
initiative such as the Big 
Ten 
Voting 
Challenge, 
Lounds 
expressed 
several 
suggestions 
based on her experiences 
at the University, such 
as 
canceling 
class 
so 
students can vote without 
missing 
lectures 
or 
exams.
“I think the University 
does a great job on doing 
publicity on whether or 
not students should vote, 
but I think if they really 
wanted students to vote, 
they would not have class 
on Election Day, they 
would tell departments 
not to schedule major 
exams on Election Day, 
they would work with the 
city to have more polling 
places 
on 
campus,” 
Lounds said. “There are 
a lot of structural issues 
that the University does 
not do a good job of 
addressing.”

Central 
Student 
Government 
passed 
a 
resolution 
in 
2017 
advocating for Election 
Day to be a University-
wide 
holiday, 
but 
administrators 
have 
not acted on such a 
suggestion. 
Despite 
logistical 
difficulties, 
Lounds 
still said she believed 
more 
students 
seem 
motivated to vote in this 
election than in previous 
elections, based in part 
due to higher numbers 
of absentee ballots that 
have already been cast. 
As of Monday, the city 
clerk’s 
office 
counted 
11,300 voters who turned 
in absentee ballots early 
in Ann Arbor. Across 
the state, the number 
of 
ballots 
issued 
and 
returned is up by more 
than 50 percent from 
2014.
“This compares more to 
a Presidential Election,” 
City 
Clerk 
Jackie 

Beaudry 
wrote 
in 
an email statement to 
MLive 
Monday. 
“We 
issued about 15,000 in 
2016 
and 
only 
8,000 
in 2014. We have had 
about 5-10 people in line 
waiting for ballots pretty 
consistently 
since 
last 
week.”
Rabhi 
was 
similarly 
optimistic 
about 
the 
impact increased voter 
turnout could have in 
this election, but also 
recognized that people 
must be committed to 
vote.
“Go to bed hopeful … 
but with that fire in your 
belly still,” Rabhi said.
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Chris Taylor made a point 
to mention Proposal A, an 
initiative on Ann Arbor’s 
ballot that would prevent 
the city from building 
a 
17-story 
commercial 
complex 
on 
a 
vacant 
lot near the Ann Arbor 
District 
Library 
and 
would instead mandate 

a city park be built in its 
place. Taylor and other 
City 
Councilmembers 
have 
opposed 
the 
proposal in recent weeks, 
though 
proponents 
of the measure push. 
Reiterating 
a 
similar 
point 
made 
by 
other 
speakers, Taylor targeted 
students by connecting 
this election to a pertinent 
issue for students looking 
for affordable housing.
LSA freshman Andrea 
Bavikatty said she only 
voted for the first time 
in 
the 
primaries 
for 
the midterm elections, 
but explained why she 
felt this election was 
especially important to 
vote in.
“In 
2016, 
obviously 
there 
wasn’t 
incentive 
for people to come out to 
the polls, people weren’t 
really feeling connected 
to the candidates … They 
didn’t really care as much 
as they do now,” Bavikatti 
said.

This isn’t the only incident 
in which the University has 
recently 
received 
backlash 
for unreliable processes of 

reporting 
sexual 
assault. 
In October, another Music,

the

Some

reported 
waiting 
months 
for

from the University regarding 
their case, while others were 
still waiting for a response.
“We expect the University 

to 
respond 
appropriately 
to 
allegations 
of

wrote in their statement. “We 
will work to ensure that they 
do so.”
Greene, 
a

“In this time when students

we want to remind those who

MISCONDUCT

Look out for Michigan Daily election coverage Tuesday, Nov. 6!


M

y 
childhood 
in 
Romania was pretty 
basic. I was raised in 
a conservative society and was 
fed American entertainment 24 
hours a day. Everything, from the 
movies I watched to the books 
I read, came mostly from the 
U.S. When I was 10, I was in a 
bookstore with my father when I 
spotted a notebook that I wanted 
to buy. I asked my father for it, but 
his answer was a clear “no.” My 
response came just as clearly: I sat 
down on the floor, arms crossed.
“Free speech,” I said, as I 
looked him in the eyes.
“Child, you are not in America, 
you are under my dictatorship,” 
my father said, clearly amused by 
my misdemeanor. He pulled me 
up and walked me out of the store.
As a European, hearing an 
American say “free speech” was 
fascinating. I couldn’t put my 
finger on the difference between 
Europe’s and America’s differing 
concepts of free speech, but I knew 
that Europeans never talked about 
it while Americans seemed to 
instinctively mention it whenever 
they could. Ten years later, as I 
hear tech companies defend their 
inability to regulate hate speech, 
the term “free speech” makes me 
shiver.
In recent years, we have seen 
countries in the European Union 
clash with American social media 
giants, as with the General Data 
Protection 
Regulation 
laws, 
which gave users more control 
over their data; the “right to be 
forgotten” enforced in the EU, 
which bans Google from sharing 
people’s 
personal 
information 
online if they have asked to 
erase it; and the German Media 
Authority’s regulation requiring 
accurate contact information to 
better regulate the ads posted on 
social media. At the same time, 
we have seen Facebook allow 
its 
advertisers 
to 
specifically 
reach “Jew haters,” or create a 
censorship guideline to delete 
posts targeted against a “protected 
category,” but not against a subset 

of that protected category. In 
one of the documents offering 
guidelines for Facebook’s censors, 
the question, “Which group is 
protected from hate speech?” 
was followed by three possible 
answers: “female drivers,” “black 
children” and “white men.” The 
correct answer? “White men.”
Had they been created in 
Europe, social media platforms 
would look different. Their fight 
to avoid any kind of governmental 
regulation 
probably 
wouldn’t 
have flourished. Strictly enforced 
regulations from the European 
Union would have taken the 
place of their own censorship 
guidelines. Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg’s motto, “Move fast 

and 
break 
things,” 
would’ve 
probably raised more eyebrows — 
especially when “breaking things” 
creates a space where hate speech 
can flourish.
Europeans 
reject 
and 
criminalize any kind of hate 
speech. Following World War II, 
the Council of Europe established 
the European Court of Human 
Rights, 
which 
protects 
free 
speech up to a certain limit: That 
limit is where it starts interfering 
with human dignity.
Dignity is a word which seems 
missing from most of the debates 
we are having on the limits of free 
speech on social media platforms. 
We talk about the need to have our 
ideas heard, to be able to freely 
debate, to go against the status-
quo. But as much as Americans 
value their “free speech,” this 
free speech does not happen in 

a vacuum. It happens within a 
historical background from which 
we are supposed to learn and 
strengthen our belief in giving 
each human being the right to 
“dignity.”
While 
many 
have 
already 
discussed the merits of regulating 
“hate speech” online in a similar 
fashion to European guidelines, 
others have complained that hate 
speech laws in Europe “suppress 
and punish left-wing viewpoints.” 
That is the point, though hate 
speech regulations were never 
meant to punish one side of the 
debate, but to punish those who 
bring the debate into the realms of 
violence and hatred. An example 
of Europe’s harsh laws was Azhar 
Ahmed’s case, when he as a 
British teenager wrote a post on 
his Facebook talking about the 
innocent Afghans killed by British 
soldiers after some British soldiers 
were killed in the war. In his post, 
he included the comment, “All 
soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! 
THE LOWLIFE F*****N SCUM!” 
which led to him being arrested 
for a “racially aggravated public 
order offense.” For many, this case 
might raise some question marks. 
For me, it only emphasizes the fact 
that both right-wing speech and 
left-wing arguments can be made 
without attacking the humanity 
and dignity of the “other,” whether 
the “other” is a group of innocent 
Afghans or British soldiers.
Europe’s hate speech laws are 
not perfect, but compared to the 
“free speech” argument, it strives 
to allow for discussions to happen 
in a safe space, helping maintain 
human empathy when arguing for 
one’s side of an argument. Whether 
a tweet or a Facebook post comes 
from someone from the political 
left or right, once violence is 
inserted, humane understanding 
is forgotten. In a political climate 
of increasing hatred, we should 
look for creating empathy on our 
social media platforms.

I 

think I look too hard for love.
Maybe I’m just a hopeless 
romantic. Maybe I just long 
to have something — or someone 
— who could pick up the trail of 
pieces I have left and rearrange 
them in a way I am unable to do 
so myself.
Upon moving to New York 
City, my hopes of finding this 
fix began to feel more palpable. 
Surely, I surmised, these pieces 
would effortlessly find a place 
to fall into. And after weeks of 
looking, they did. Yet it was not 
where I expected.
The warm days of July began 
to fade, and a growing desire to 
mend this enduring discontent 
came along with it. An occupation 
of the mind with something 
different, I concluded, would be 
the best remedy.
Hoping to get involved with 
the thriving gay community of 
New York, I decided to visit the 
local Callen-Lorde Community 
Health Center in an effort to find 
ways to volunteer within the 
community. Never before had I 
been to a major city health center 
specifically for LGBTQ people. 
And never before had I truly 
understood the significance these 
centers have.
After being greeted by the 
building’s security guard, his 
weathered face marked with an 
enduring smile, I was pointed 
toward the entrance of the 
center’s youth program. I took a 
seat on one of the inviting green 
sofas that filled the room, waiting 
for the hall’s two receptionists 
to call me to speak. Both of them 
must have been near the same 
age as me, yet their poise and 
steadiness with each coming 
patient before them affirmed 
their experience.
Despite the uncertainty that 
painted the faces of those in the 
room, a sense of belonging and 
safety filled the air. People from 
different corners of the country, 
some escaping tattered homes — 
some, the brutal grip of poverty 
— came to one, unified refuge. 
The woman next to me, gently 
unwrinkling a thin stack of 
dollar bills in her rugged hands, 
explained that she had to wait 
three extra days to return for 
her next round of injections for 
hormone therapy. The boy who 
walked in before me joked with 

the young woman behind the 
desk, with a soft gaze affirming 
each word that left his mouth.
The tightness in my chest 
loosened as I began to understand 
that no internal guard was needed 
here. I did not have to regulate 
my words or the way in which 
those words left my mouth. I had 
found a place that required no 
additional explanation of myself, 
or my experiences, because we 
all were sewn from the very same 
thread.
I took a deep breath and 
peered around the room full of 
people who bore no physical or 
familial appearance, but shared 
something so palpable that it 

filled the air.
This is what love looked like 
in its purest form. It wasn’t love 
by any traditional means — or at 
least the love I had imagined. But 
it was a love that I was missing 
in my life. Now, the pieces I had 
left behind were not picked back 
up but replaced with something 
stronger.
Recently, there have been many 
days filled with hopelessness 
from what I see in the news, on 
my campus or even in my own 
home. While there is a crucial 
duty to maintain dialogue among 
all of us to bridge these seemingly 
irreconcilable differences, there 
remains a need for spaces where 
people from all walks of life can 
come together to heal and grow. 
Centers like Callen-Lorde remain 
crucial for such a reality. These 
centers do not just provide a 
space for people who have been 
kicked out of their homes or cast 
aside by society. They provide 
vital medical care to individuals 
who would otherwise often not 
have access to such resources. 
Some people are without such 
proper care due to discrimination 

— others due to homelessness, 
a lack of financial means or 
limited English proficiency. In 
fact, in the case of community 
health centers in general, over 
70 percent of patients seen 
have incomes below the federal 
poverty level. These centers have 
medical professionals trained to 
specifically handle LGBT-related 
health issues. There are many 
types of treatments and services, 
such as hormone therapy and pre-
exposure 
prophylaxis 
(PrEP), 
that many physicians may not be 
familiar with.
Almost one in 10 LGBTQ 
people have said that a health 
care provider has refused to see 
them because of their actual or 
perceived 
sexual 
orientation, 
and three in 10 transgender 
individuals experienced the same 
treatment due to their actual or 
perceived gender identity. Such 
instances have taken place in our 
own state of Michigan, and are 
often even protected under the 
law. For example, in Roseville, a 
pediatrician refused care to an 
infant because she had same-
sex parents. Beyond our own 
state, a transgender 14-year-old, 
admitted to a San Diego hospital 
for attempting to commit suicide, 
was continuously misgendered 
and discharged early from the 
hospital staff. Upon release, he 
killed himself. These community 
centers are not just helpful, they 
are crucial to closing some of the 
many disparities afflicting our 
health care system.
My time in New York allowed 
me to see these integral spaces 
in our country firsthand. Callen-
Lorde is an oasis for people who 
have been set aside because of 
who they love or the way they 
were born to exist in a place — no 
matter how temporary — without 
judgment.
Through expansion and greater 
awareness of these centers, it is 
that very love and support that I 
hope to further on campus, and 
beyond, in the future.

W

e 
are 
writing 
as 
concerned 
members 
of 
the 
UM community in response to 
Dean Elizabeth Cole’s letter 
to 
Professor 
John 
Cheney-
Lippold outlining disciplinary 
measures. We are also disturbed 
by the covert politicization of 
teaching and service evidenced 
in President Mark Schlissel’s 
and Provost Martin Philbert’s 
letter to the campus. Under the 
guise of separating political 
commitments from our role 
as educators, the university 
administration 
has 
taken 
a 
clear political stance against 
the 
Boycott, 
Divestment, 
and 
Sanctions 
movement. 
Irrespective of faculty positions 
regarding BDS, the President, 
Provost and Dean’s disciplinary 
actions 
threaten 
academic 
freedom and have had a chilling 
effect on workplace morale. 
Rather than debating the merits 
of an important political issue 
of our time, the university has 
taken a side, and disparaged 
pro-BDS students, staff and 
faculty.
We 
stand 
in 
solidarity 
with others who have already 
expressed their disagreement 
with the administration. We 
agree 
with 
UM 
Professor 
Juan Cole who wrote that it is 
not “the place of a university 
administration 
to 
coerce 
faculty or other instructors’ 
conscience on these issues, 
which are much more complex 
than they seem to realize.” We 
agree with Stanford University 
Professor 
David 
Palumbo-
Liu who wrote, “disciplining 
faculty who refuse to write 
letters opens up the possibility 
that universities will be turned 
into pawns of ideologically-
driven organizations who target 
professors 
critical 
of 
their 
views.”
We 
stand 
with 
graduate 
students who have stated that 
such 
disciplinary 
measures 
set “an alarming, worrying, 
and dangerous precedent for 
impinging on the protected 
political speech and action of 
employees of the university.”
We stand with signers of the 
Change.org petition who assert 
that such disciplinary actions 
promote the corporatization of 
education and thus trivialize 
our 
work 
as 
educators 
by 
“bypassing 
the 
educational 
mission of the university (...) 
and turning professors into 
simply service providers.”
The University of Michigan 
has always stood firm on the 
issues of academic freedom 
enshrined 
in 
the 
faculty 
handbook. 
We 
remain 
committed to this tradition and 
to educating thoughtful critical 
thinkers and citizens. We call 
on the administration to refrain 
from any disciplinary actions 
against 
graduate 
student 
Lucy Peterson and to drop 
the actions against Professor 
John Cheney-Lippold. We call 
on the university to include 
diverse 
voices 
in 
the 
new 
panel the provost has created 
to examine the intersection 
between 
political 
thought/
ideology and faculty members’ 
responsibilities 
to 
students. 
We call on the university to 
affirm our shared institutional 
commitment 
to 
academic 
freedom.

CONCERT REVIEW

The music industry is and 
always has been inherently 
jaded. It seems that most 
audiences 
need 
something 
either wildly out of the norm or 
blatantly terrible to jostle them 
out of their typical listening 
cycles. And then, there are acts 
like Tomberlin. These artists 
and bands serve as fascinating 
bright spots on the face of new 
music, using existing genre 
norms 
to 
form 
something 
pure, 
intense 
and 
brutally 
honest that cuts to the core. 
Though unassuming at face 
value, these acts hold a veiled 
power that comes through in 
every song. At Ann Arbor’s 
own Blind Pig on Sunday night, 
Tomberlin stunned the crowd 
with this very candor, seizing 
their attention completely for a 
fleeting hour.
Tomberlin, the moniker of 
lead singer and writer Sarah 
Beth 
Tomberlin, 
performs 
with only a guitarist and 
keyboardist — a spare ensemble 
that works to enhance the pure 
emotion of her music. Sunday’s 
performance was a date on 
her 
first 
tour 
supporting 
alternative rocker Mirah.
“I am so excited to be 
touring for the first time,” 
she giggled at the beginning 
of her set. While Tomberlin 
may be green, her intensity is 
old, evident in songs from her 
debut album At Weddings that 

have been percolating since her 
high school years. Raised in 
southern Illinois by a minister 
father and homeschooled until 
the age of 16, the religious 
influences in her music are 
clear but not contrite — the 

only 
obvious 
similarities 
to 
hymns 
are 
Tomberlin’s 
piercing clarity and smooth 
choir-girl voice, which serve 
to carry emotionally-complex 
lyrics in a peaceful haze.
Tomberlin took the stage 
in black jeans, an oversized 
grey sweatshirt and her long 
blonde-brown 
hair 
pulled 
back in a large scrunchie, 
standing at the mic with the 
same calm I imagine she would 
have standing in line at the 
post office. She is obviously 
a natural performer, and it’s 
not because of any crazy stage 
antics — her presence speaks 

for itself, devoid of any glitter. 
Her 
gravitas 
silenced 
the 
sparse crowd at The Blind Pig 
on Sunday, while they settled 
into their seats anticipating 
the headliner. As soon as 
Sarah Beth Tomberlin’s mouth 
opened, everyone else’s closed. 
There’s a special kind of magic 
in 
her 
intonation: 
While 
her songs are beautiful and 
emotionally 
poignant, 
they 
cover bases that have been run 
a million times before — love, 
loss, tears, family struggle, 
confusion, life struggle. What 
makes 
Tomberlin’s 
music 
stand out is that incredible 
voice, and everything that 
seems to hide behind it. It 
seemed as if she was able to 
project every emotion at once 
through that club microphone, 
enhanced by the atmospheric 
guitar and synth of her modern 
arrangements.
Tomberlin 
effortlessly 
played through the entirety of 
At Weddings throughout her 
hour at The Blind Pig, leaving 
the audience slack-jawed with 
her quiet power. On songs like 
“Tornado” and “Any Other 
Way,” the songwriter’s voice 
soared 
and 
dropped 
with 
equal 
measure, 
all 
within 
the net of her beautifully 
plain presentation. She is an 
example of what pure talent 
can really do in a space where 
it is allowed to run free: In that 
sparsely populated club, under 
a slowly turning disco ball, 
Tomberlin was the brightest 
spark there.

shines at The Blind Pig

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

“Ambient” is an adjective 
increasingly used to describe 
music of all kinds, and the 
boundaries of the genre the 
word 
used 
to 
signify 
are 
becoming more porous all the 
time. The primary criterion 
for “ambient” music is that it 
doesn’t go anywhere, and in its 
immobility it becomes akin to 
an object or a presence. Most 
non-musical sound is like this: 
Sounds indicate some kind of 
activity outside of the frame, 
giving subliminal information 
about the environment. Ambient 

music zeroes in on these small, 
typically ignored sounds and 
takes them as a compositional 
model, using musical techniques 
to create the sensation of an 
enveloping background, a stand-
in for organic acoustic ecologies.
It’s an interesting approach, 
and 
more 
than 
a 
little 
paradoxical. By its very nature, 
we generally don’t pay much 
attention to the “background,” 
or whatever borders the frame 
of 
human 
sonic 
perception, 
so making music that focuses 
intently on sound-as-landscape 
is almost contradictory in and of 
itself. Ambient music is the art 
of the afterthought, or else an 
invitation to pay a deep attention 

to the edges of perception. This 
leads to a certain confusion about 
the function and intentions of 
ambient music — is it music 
that’s intended to be put on in 
the background, for blending 
with the sounds of a situation, 
or is it music that creates the 
sensation of a new background? 
Can it be a little bit of both?
The composer and producer 
Brian Eno once described the 
difference between conventional 
and ambient music like the 
difference between architecture 
and 
gardening. 
His 
music 
exemplifies this sonic garden, 
and in many ways he has led the 
development of the form from 
the ’70s onward. He wrote in 

The paradoxical nature
& way of ambient music

EMILY YANG
Daily Arts Writer

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

the liner notes to his 1982 album 
On Land that, “what qualified a 
piece for inclusion on the record 
was that it took me somewhere,” 
and he means that both literally 
and 
specifically. 
Titles 
are 
references to real or abstracted 
places where the listener can 
imagine the sounds living in 
— for example, “Lizard Point,” 
“Lantern Marsh,” “A Clearing.” 
The music in On Land doesn’t 
really go anywhere — tracks 
simply fade in, camp out for nine 
or so minutes and then fade out.
The liner notes for On Land 
are interesting to compare to 
the notes for the earlier Ambient 
1: Music For Airports, where 
he alludes to the idea of sonic 
landscape but seems to suggest 
that the intention of Airports is to 
live alongside spaces: “Whereas 
conventional background music 
is produced by stripping away all 
sense of doubt and uncertainty 
(and thus all genuine interest) 
from the music, ambient music 
retains 
these 
qualities.” 
In 
1978, Eno was still conceiving 
his music as essentially living 
in the background, but later 
moved to music that supplants 
environmental 
sound 
(and 
therefore a sense of place) 
altogether. The notes for On 
Land conclude that, “as the 
listener, I wanted to be situated 
inside a large field of loosely-knit 
sound, rather than placed before 
a tightly organised monolith.” 
Airports “retains” its context, 
On Land “takes” the listener to a 
new place via sound. The space 
between Eno’s approach in 1978 
and 1982 is encapsulated in the 
difference between “for” and 
“on.”
And indeed, the sound-world 
of Music For Airports is much 
more conventional than On 
Land, with its foregrounded 
piano lines and gently sweeping 
cadential gestures. There is 
little noise, whereas On Land 
is full of field recordings and 
various 
non-pitched 
burbles, 
often deeply submerging any 
recognizably “musical” material. 
Music For Airports, its materials 
basically 
being 
tones 
and 
silence, seems to suggest that 
the surroundings will provide 
plenty of site-specific noise. On 
Land provides all the noise you 
would need for a soundscape, 
and is thus more a stand-in or 
proxy for the background and all 
its environmental noise.

The kind of ambient music in 
On Land seems to have caught 
on. It’s rare to find an album of 
slow, filmic, largely empty music 
like Airports in the 2000s and 
2010s, but it’s much easier to find 
the enveloping omnipresence 
pioneered in On Land. The 
work of William Basinski, for 
example, is generally as close 
to the Airports model as 2000s 
ambience gets, and he much 
more often suggests deep, thick 
soundscapes. 2007’s Shortwave 

Music uses a kind of Lynchian 
mode, with vaguely orchestral 
tones 
submerged 
under 
crackling, hissing and humming. 
The work of Sarah Davachi 
is less noisy than Basinski’s, 
but her approach is similarly 
immersive. She conjures slowly 
moving textures out of long, 
overlapping tones, and the sort 
of microscopic details she uses 
require a lot of focused attention 
for the music to pay off. The 
tracks on the recently-released 
Gave In Rest have the quality of 
a world made of tones. Davachi’s 
conventional ensemble (strings, 
a monophonic synthesizer and 
occasionally a piano) is placed 
inside the “field of loosely-knit 
sound” 
Eno 
describes, 
like 
people milling about in a room 
together, 
sometimes 
having 
conversations but usually just 
thinking out loud.
It’s unsurprising that ambient 
music evolved from a genre of 
music that stands behind an 
environment to a genre that 

supplants 
an 
environment, 
because the form Eno had in 
mind for Airports and the earlier 
Discreet 
Music 
is 
unstable. 
It’s ambient music’s refusal to 
go anywhere, to simply make 
statements, that makes it so 
unsuitable as actual music to 
put on in the background of a 
business or a social situation. 
Music invites attention, and 
music that has a low level of 
activity or progression invites 
a deeper, almost meditative 
engagement, 
the 
kind 
best 
done alone. In my experience, 
putting on an album of recent 
ambient music in a room will 
make 
conversation 
peter 
out pretty quickly, but most 
anything else, from Mozart 
to Young Thug (depending on 
context), is paradoxically easier 
to ignore. Ultimately, I think 
ambient music doesn’t work in 
its professed role, because by its 
very nature it overreaches.
What is the appeal of music 
like this? It seems to make sense 
that in a moment of accelerated 
technological advancement and 
media saturation, contemplative, 
immobile 
music 
is 
an 
appropriate response, a place 
one can go to retreat. However, 
music is also never entirely 
effective at putting up a front to 
society, always bringing pieces 
of the past and present with it. 
The writer Meghan O’Gieblyn 
argues 
that 
meditation 
and 
contemplative practice — what 
she calls the “Eternal Now” — 
represents a continuation of 
the logic of the internet rather 
than a repudiation of it: “In 
lieu of context, in lieu of vista, 
one is forced to find meaning in 
the microscopic details which 
must eventually come to seem 
intricate and endless … To exist 
within that room of perpetual 
updates and endless opinions 
is to believe that history can 
be divided not by centuries 
but by seconds, that every idea 
must lead to finer sub-points 
and infinite distinctions that 
eventually 
contradict 
one 
another.” 
Ambient 
music 
is 
perhaps sort of a record of 
cultural exhaustion, of being 
caught in situations that seem to 
demand a collapse of context. It 
seems to say — if we have found 
our present cultural landscape 
unlivable, the best we can do 
is create miniatures of it for 
ourselves.

An evolution and a new breed of Wolverine

D

oes the name Maverick 
Morgan ring a bell?
In case it doesn’t, 
Morgan was 
a center for 
Illinois from 
2013 to 2017 
and had a 
perfectly 
fine career, 
averaging 
5.6 points 
per game 
in 135 total 
appearances. 
But if you 
primarily follow the Michigan 
men’s basketball team, that’s 
not what you remember him for.
“They are more of a white-
collar team traditionally and at 
Illinois we’re about toughness 
and together,” Morgan said 
of the Wolverines after his 
Fighting Illini thumped them, 
85-69, in January of 2017.
Michigan, of course, returned 
the favor later that year, 
ending Illinois’ season on the 
way to an unexpected Big Ten 
Tournament title and Sweet 
16 appearance. But everyone 
makes statements they might 
regret making later on. I’m not 
bringing this up to make fun of 
Morgan.
Maybe you remember him, 
and maybe you don’t. What you 
do remember is his perception.
And, well, if “white-collar” 
maybe wasn’t the most refined 
wording, it’s not 
like it was unfair.
When you 
remember the 
Wolverine teams 
of the mid-2010s, 
you don’t think 
of physical freaks 
crashing the 
boards, swatting 
shots into the 
second row or 
driving hard to 
the rim. Instead, you think of 
precise ball movement, constant 
motion and Trey Burke, Nik 
Stauskas and Moritz Wagner 
draining triples from all over 
the court.
You won’t find much of that 
on this year’s roster. Where 
Burke, the 2013 Naismith 
Award-winner, once manned 
the point, there’s junior Zavier 
Simpson, a pitbull of a defender 
with a limited offensive game, 

but the heart of the team 
regardless. On the wing, visions 
of Stauskas and his silky-
smooth 3-point stroke have 
given way to redshirt junior 
Charles Matthews — one of the 
best athletes Beilein’s coached 
at Michigan, but a mere 56 
percent foul shooter. The holes 
created by the departures of 
Wagner and Duncan Robinson 
this offseason are being filled 
by sophomore Isaiah Livers — a 
versatile defender and strong 
rebounding presence — and 
junior Jon Teske — a hulking, 
7-foot-1 rim-protecting colossus.
As a team, Michigan shot 
above 35 percent from 3-point 
range every year since 2011. 
Only one player on the roster — 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
— did so last season.
The first glimpse of the 
2018-2019 Wolverines came 
last Friday against Division II 
Northwood. Michigan took just 
11 3-pointers, scoring 56 of 90 
points in the paint and 24 on 
the fast break. It didn’t make its 
first three until 19 minutes into 
the game. It forced 10 steals, 
which led to 22 points. Simpson 
and Poole jumped passing lanes, 
led the break and got to the rim. 
Livers and freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis ran the wheels 
off the Timberwolves and threw 
down transition slams.
It was an exhibition, sure, but 
it told this much: these aren’t 
your parents’ 
Wolverines.
“We’re 
definitely going 
to be another 
really good 
defending team,” 
Poole said. 
“We’re going to 
want to get up 
and down the 
floor extremely 
fast and get it out 
and go. Lot of high-flyers, lot of 
attack-the-rim guys, back cuts 
and being able to throw lobs. 
This is an extremely athletic 
team, and we’re able to attack 
more and get to the basket 
more.”
Michigan coach John Beilein 
has spoken of the need to adapt 
his complex offensive system to 
his team’s personnel. He’s also 
aware that his team will rely 
first and foremost on an elite 

defense.
But it’s one thing for a coach 
to tailor his gameplan to the 
strengths of his roster, or to 
preach attacking, downhill 
offense and tough, hard-nosed 
defending. Mostly, that’s just 
good coaching.
It’s another thing entirely 
for a team to take scrappy 
defense and aggressive offense 
to heart and make it its identity 
— especially a team whose 
identity, until recently, has been 
the complete opposite.
That identity was apparent 
when the Wolverines finished 
with the third-most efficient 
defense in the country last 
season. It’s apparent when 
Beilein states that Simpson and 
Matthews — the upperclass 
leaders of the team — will “not 
let you not play defense.” It’s 
apparent when players and 
coaches mention the defensive 
improvement of players such as 
Poole, whose inconsistent effort 
often kept him off the court last 
year.
Under Beilein, Michigan 
has had five top-30 seasons in 
offensive efficiency, per Ken 

Pomeroy’s advanced ratings 
system. Until last season, 
though, it had never had a 
defense rank above 37th.
But last season, that all began 
to change. A misfit group of role 
players, unheralded veterans 
and promising 
freshmen clicked 
with a defensive 
mastermind 
in first-year 
assistant coach 
Luke Yaklich, 
with Simpson’s 
tenacious 
leadership 
spurring them 
on. An offense 
that was, 
for Michigan’s standards, 
inconsistent, did just enough 
to win, and occasionally much 
more. It all culminated in one of 
the more unexpected Final Four 
runs in recent memory.
This year, the evolution is just 
about complete. The Wolverines 
have taken a formula that 
worked last season and doubled 
down on it this year.
“We built a name last year 
that we could be a pretty good 

defensive team,” Simpson 
said at Michigan’s media 
day in October. “This year, 
it’s a different breed on this 
team, and that breed is more 
aggressive.”
In a sport with as much 
season-to-
season change 
and personnel 
turnover 
as college 
basketball, 
however, 
flexibility is 
key. Maybe in 
a year, another 
evolution will 
take place. Maybe 
Poole, Livers and 
freshmen such as Adrien Nunez, 
David DeJulius and Colin 
Castleton start bombing away 
in a fashion resembling the 
Wolverines of yesteryear.
But it’s unlikely that anyone 
will be calling Michigan 
“white-collar” anytime soon.

I

t was June, and Jordan Poole 
wanted to talk.
He dialed John Beilein, fresh 
off a flirtation with the Detroit 
Pistons, and secured a meeting. 
The two, along with assistant coach 
DeAndre Haynes, sat down in Beilein’s 
office. This wasn’t the first time the trio met 
over the course of the Poole’s first year in 
Ann Arbor, but the tone had changed — and 
that change had come from Poole.
The sophomore wanted Beilein to know 
that he was ready to be a leader. He wanted 
Beilein to know he was locked in, putting 
in hours at the gym. He wanted Beilein to 
know that, with Duncan Robinson, Moritz 
Wagner 
and 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-
Rahkman gone, he was ready to step up and 
help fill the void. More than anything, he 
wanted Beilein to know that freshman year 
was behind him.
Haynes quietly smiled throughout the 
whole thing.
“He was proud, I guess, for the way that 
I called the meeting,” Poole told the Daily, 
all 6-foot-5 of him hunching forward in 
his chair. “Cause he was in all the other 
meetings that weren’t so good, earlier on in 

the year.”
Three months before making that 
phone call, Poole etched himself into 
Michigan lore with a game-winner that 
sent the Wolverines to the Sweet Sixteen 
and added a sentence to his epitaph. He 
ran laps around the arena that night in 
Wichita, then embraced a horde of cameras 
disproportionate to his playing time as the 
Wolverines carved their way through the 
NCAA Tournament field.
That moment is what his freshman year 
— and perhaps his entire career with the 
Wolverines — will be remembered for. It’s 
not what his freshman year was about.
Five days after that shot, against Texas 
A&M, Poole jumped a passing lane when he 
should’ve stayed put, handing the Aggies’ 
Robert Williams an uncontested dunk. 
Poole went straight to the bench. That 
wasn’t what his freshman year was about 
either.
Rather, it was finding the balance 
between those two moments — the unafraid 
shotmaking that extended Michigan’s 
season and the undisciplined flashes that 
would send Beilein into a conniption — that 
defined the last year for Jordan Poole.

“I was just outgoing,” Poole said. “And 
coming from a high school where I’m 
always able to be the man, and the coach 
who has been here so many years and he 
wants things his way. And a kid with so 
much confidence — I wasn’t gonna let him 
break me.
“… It was definitely like a clash.”
***
Jordan Poole is a walking superlative — 
unique, outgoing, confident. Anyone who 
has ever met him will tell you this, and it 
doesn’t take long to see.
Once Poole arrived at Michigan, it took 
all of one pickup game for that to become 
apparent.
“He came in and just fired the first shot,” 
said Ibi Watson. “I knew that from right 
there, he wasn’t lacking any confidence.”
It wasn’t just the first shot though. It was 
the first shot, on his first touch, in his first 
pickup game, of his first year, and it was a 
deep 3-pointer. The next time down the 
floor, as soon as he touched the ball, Poole 
launched it again. Oh, and he hit them both.
“It’s not that it’s disrespectful or anything 
like that,” Robinson said. “But it definitely 
kinda put everyone else on notice.”


Poole said he felt like the most ready 
freshman of the group, and it showed 
in those early practices. He talked 
trash. He was loud. He took every shot 
that came to him.
And he backed it up. Poole hit a 
whole lot of those shots — teammates 
knew right away he would have a role 
to play down the line. Beilein did too, 
but Poole had to learn to play with 
structure.
When Beilein culled the rotation, 
about a week before opening night, 
Poole wasn’t a part of it. Instead, for 
the early part of the season, he was 
resigned to the scout team.
In his year at LaLumiere, a prep 
school in LaPorte, Ind., Poole was the 
sixth man — a product of the talent on 
the roster, which included five-star 
recruits Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brian 
Bowen II. Even then, Poole estimated 
he still played more minutes than the 
starter at shooting guard.
The scout team — that was unheard 
of for someone with Poole’s talent and 
effervescent confidence.
“When (Beilein) first said it, I was 
kinda like, in shock,” Poole said. “... 
And then that hurt, for a little bit. But 
then I realized why I was on the scout 
team. I was gonna get up more shots 
and be aggressive and just hoop at the 
end of the day. That’s kinda what the 
scout team really is. It wasn’t as bad as 
people make it seem.”
Sitting in Crisler Center’s media 
room with a year of perspective under 
his belt, knowing how well things 
worked out, Poole can say that. At the 
time, it wasn’t so easy.
Poole is, for good and for bad, 
himself. That means wearing his 
emotions on his sleeve, and at first, 
this one was disappointment. The 
rest of the team could feel that he was 
unhappy. Beilein rode him, calling 
Poole out in practices whenever 
he saw something. Poole took it 
personally. At times, responsibility 
fell to Wagner, Zavier Simpson and 
Charles Matthews, who took care 
to make sure Poole was attentive, 
listening and above all, encouraged. 
Poole was too good — too important 
— for them to let him get down on 
himself.
“We all kinda knew that we were 
gonna need him,” Wagner said. “And 
he kinda needed to understand that. 
… We really pushed him to keep focus 
on the practice, even when it seemed 
like it wasn’t gonna have any impact, 
which is not true.”
It didn’t take long for Poole to play 
his way off the scout team. He got 
his first big chance on Dec. 2 against 
Indiana, when Matthews got in early 
foul trouble. Then he ran with it, 
scoring 19 points on 5-of-10 shooting 
from 3-point range. The fourth of 
those five — a pull-up jumper over the 
Hoosiers’ Zach McRoberts from a step 

inside the 28-foot line — set the tone 
for the rest of his season.
Poole, still, took risks. He took 
those deep threes (and made a good 
amount), ball-watched on defense and 
turned it over more than he assisted. 
One December day, sidelined with 
an injury and watching a practice in 
which Poole was playing well, Wagner 
turned to Beilein.
“Man,” he recalled saying, “this kid 
is really good.”
“You know what’s crazy?” Beilein 
responded. “He can be so much better. 
That’s what I see.”
“I probably have said that to many, 
cause you could see the talent oozing 
out of him,” Beilein told The Daily. 
“But knowing how he can be more 
efficient with his game. If you saw 
his assist-to-turnover ratios — you 
didn’t see the practice ones — and you 
saw his shooting percentage, you’d 
say, ‘He’s better than this. These are 
like, tough guys that aren’t very good 
players.’ ”
***
Beilein is a perfectionist, and every 
bit as stubborn a personality as Poole. 
Just days ago, he walked into a press 
conference and called the Wolverines’ 
performance at Selfie Night — a fan-
friendly open practice the team puts 
on in lieu of Midnight Madness — a 
“defensive massacre.” More than that, 
his system demands adherence.
Poole needed to understand that 
this 
wasn’t 
about shot-
making, 
it 
was 
about 
the 
little 
things. 
Watching 
film. 
Defense. 
Playing 
within 
the 
system.
“I didn’t 
know what 
a bad shot 
was, but I 
wouldn’t 
stop taking 
bad 
shots,” 
Poole 
said. “... I 
wouldn’t 
really 
lock 
into film as 
much as I 
should have, 
only because 
I was more 
thinking 
about, 
‘Let 
me 
show 
(Beilein) 
I 
can 
make 
this 
shot.’ 
Or, ‘Let me 
show him I 

can do this. Let me show him I can do 
that.’
“I was just out there hooping, but 
then when I really settled down and 
looked at film and started thinking, 
‘Alright, what’s a good shot? What’s a 
bad shot?’ And try to think more about 
the game without thinking too much 
about the game is where I found a 
happy medium.”
Nearly everyone asked pointed to 
either the Maui Tournament over 
Thanksgiving or the Indiana game 
a week later as the place where that 
medium was found. Everyone except 
two people: Jordan Poole and John 
Beilein.
Those games got Poole into the 
rotation, but that was about it. Still, 
the same issues existed, and Poole 
struggled to rectify them. For both 
Poole 
and 
Beilein, 
finding 
that 
medium took the whole year.
“I think that in high school, he was 
a really, really good player. Certainly 
the best player on his team,” Beilein 
said. “And, perhaps, it was very 
difficult, where he probably thinks, 
‘Oh, I gotta carry the load for this 
team.’ And he doesn’t. He’s got other 
good players around him. And then 
you get there and the pressure on a 
freshman, especially one as highly 
recruited, or highly-rated, to live up 
to expectations, it just wraps them all 
up.”
“I didn’t realize it until the end 

of the year that it wasn’t more like, 
he was picking on me cause I was a 
freshman. It was more like he just 
wanted me to be able to do this,” Poole 
said. “... As the year starts to go on, you 
realize that he just wants the best for 
you. He wouldn’t have recruited you if 
he didn’t know what you were capable 
of. I realized that later in the year, and 
that’s when our relationship really 
started to grow.”
Most of that adjustment was Poole’s 
to make. But some of it fell to Beilein. 
As the gregarious freshman learned 
to tone things down and focus on film 
sessions, the coach learned that Poole 
does well with positive reinforcement.
Now, when Beilein sees Poole 
commit turnovers in practice, he 
doesn’t get on him unrelentingly, 
instead asking the sophomore what he 
saw and working from it.
“As I watched him adapt, right, I 
could see that he was trending in the 
right direction,” Beilein said. “And 
it’s never fast enough for a coach, but 
I could see him trending in the right 
direction. So, I embraced that.”
That 
doesn’t 
mean 
Poole’s 
personality is gone — it’s very much 
intact and always will be. That’s part 
of the package, and there’s a notable 
upside to his personality.
Poole talks people up, taking his 
confidence out on the rest of the 
team. He saw himself as a leader from 
the moment he stepped in the door 

at Michigan. At the Final Four, he 
walked the walk. Beilein mentioned 
his “leadership possibilities,” but for 
Poole, that’s already a reality.
When he talks, people listen. It 
has been that way at every level Poole 
has played basketball, he said, and it 
was no different last year despite his 
freshman status.
“We use technicalities as like, the 
juniors and seniors are the leaders of 
the team,” Poole said. 
“But I feel like I was always trying 
to find a way to give us a boost.”
Still, he could get away with having 
a bad day last year. That’s not the case 
anymore. When you’re always on, you 
always need to be on. Otherwise, it’s 
noticeable, and it rubs off.
One day this year, Poole let himself 
have a bad practice. The rest of the 
team followed suit. That’s the burden 
of being the guy who calls Beilein over 
the summer asking to meet.
The challenge in front of Poole has 
shifted. Now, he wants to be the one 
pulling someone aside to offer help 
instead of the person receiving it. 
Yet, in so many ways, it comes back 
to the same theme, one that Poole has 
wrought through the last year of ups 
and downs — sulking on scout team, 
hitting that shot, embracing those 
cameras, calling that meeting.
Through change and through 
growth, Jordan Poole will always 
have the challenge of being himself.

Players, assistants, opponents reflect on Beilein ahead of 800th win

Tuesday night against Norfolk 
State, Michigan coach John Beilein 
will begin his 37th season as an 
NCAA head coach. Along the way, 
he has collected 799 career victories, 
from Division III Nazareth College 
to his current 11-year tenure with the 
Wolverines. Ahead of his 800th win, 
The Michigan Daily spoke to former 
players, assistants and opponents to 
learn about their experiences with 
Beilein.

Patrick Beilein, son; guard, 
West Virginia, 2002-06; graduate 
assistant, Michigan, 2008-10

I would just remember always 
being excited to go to the gym 
with him for practice or a game. I 
remember if I couldn’t go to a game 
with him because it was too late on a 
school night, I would give him a toy, 
one of my favorite toys that I thought 
would give luck, and he would put 
it in his suit. So that was just big 
growing up, we looked forward to 
the basketball season because we 
would be able to go to the games, 
practice but also be around the game 
that I obviously grew up to love.
Once I got older, once I got into 
high school, I was able to play with 
the University of Richmond guys in 
the summer and in the spring. So 
that was good for my development. 
But at a young age, my brother and 
I, we would just be there at the gym, 
and we’d be on the side, whether 
dribbling a ball or chasing each other 
around, getting into trouble. So that’s 
how it was.

***

It was great (playing for him), 
I called him ‘Dad’ on the sideline 
all the time just cause that was 
the 
relationship 
we 
had. 
My 
favorite moment, like kinda a son-
father moment, was going into 
my sophomore year, he pulled me 
aside. And I thought I had a decent 
freshman year, he had brought in 
new guys, and I was kinda going 
through the motions to begin the 
start of sophomore year because I 
played my freshman year, I thought 
I was a big shot. He pulled me to 
the side and said, ‘When’s the last 
time you’ve taken a charge, dove for 
a ball, boxed somebody out so hard 
that they fell over? Would you stop 
being a pretty boy and play the game 
the way you were taught to play?’ 
After that, I know that practice, I 
had blood everywhere it seemed like. 

’Cause he was my father figure at the 
time and said, ‘You’re better than 
this,’ and that I disrespected him. So 
that was my favorite moment, and I 
never looked back from that.

Isaiah 
Livers,

Michigan, 2017-present

Coach (Beilein) is an amazing 
coach. I’ve never met any coach like 
this, especially on the visit, how he 
carries himself and what he stands 
for. He cares about the players so 
much to the point where, if you 
make the decision to stop playing 
basketball, just give him a reason — 
just give him a good, constructive 
reason, and he’ll support you all 
the way no matter what. That’s 
just insane to me, like he cares 
more about your school than your 
basketball career.
(The first time I met him), we 
talked about baseball. I was a 
huge baseball fan. I loved baseball, 
baseball was my first love. And 
I think when we connected on 
baseball, that took our relationship 
to another step. 

Ignas 
Brazdeikis, 
forward, 
Michigan, 2018-present

He was exactly the same (during 
the recruiting process) as he is now, 
that’s the one thing I absolutely 
love about him. Everything he said, 
everything he told me was the same 
and he was just an honest guy. Like 
really, really honest and he never lied 
and I felt like I could trust him.

Saddi Washington, assistant 
coach, Michigan, 2016-present

Man, it’s been awesome (working 
with Beilein). I think that the biggest 
thing that you learn under coach 
Beilein is just, he’s an excellent CEO. 
But even more than that, he’s just 
a great person, you know? And I 
think the genuineness that he treats 
everybody with and the authenticity 
that comes across when he engages 
not just our players or recruits but 
our kids, our spouses and everybody 
in between. And I think, if anybody 
is deserving of the accolades that he 
gets, certainly it’s coach Beilein.
His attention to detail in every 
aspect of the program is like none 
other. And I think that’s why we’re 
able to operate with great efficiency, 
both on and off the court. I think 
that’s a huge strength of his that I 
hope that I am able to absorb and 
acquire moving forward.

Austin 
Davis, 
forward, 

Michigan, 2016-present

It’s really been amazing (playing 
under Beilein). I feel like he’s one 
of the few coaches that genuinely 
focuses on bettering each one of us 
as a man, not just as a player but as a 
man, and for the rest of our lives. He 
really, really instills a lot of our core 
values into us and makes sure that 
we always consider those and live 
every day by those. So I think he’s a 
great coach to play for and wouldn’t 
have wanted to play for anybody else.

Moritz 
Wagner, 
forward, 
Michigan, 2015-18

He was always really hard on me, 
and I — something I felt I was the 
blame for everything. But after my 
sophomore year, I understood that 
was the way he wanted to get me 
better. … It was for my sake. He sees 
the potential in you, and eventually 
I committed to that and said, ‘Ok, 
whatever. I know what you’re doing, 
so let’s work together.’ I don’t really 
know if I have a specific story but 
that’s just what I’ve experienced. 
Coach Beilein really cares about 
his players. I still have a really good 
relationship with him, try to talk to 
him as much as I can. And yeah, it 
was the best decision of my life to go 
there, 100-percent.

DJ Wilson, forward, Michigan, 
2014-17

He’s a great person. That’s one of 
the sole reasons why I chose to go 
to Michigan, just him and his staff 
at the time. I just felt like they were 
genuine people, me and my family 
both got that vibe, it was kinda just 
natural. Then, just playing under 
him, he stuck with me when he 
coulda went elsewhere, he had other 
players to recruit. He never really 
recruited over me, he just stuck with 
me and everything worked out for 
the both of us. So that speaks to his 
character and the type of person he 
is.
I thought he was a great guy, I 
thought he was real genuine. Like I 
said, that’s something that I kinda 
observed. Especially, you know, 
going into college, as far as what I 
was looking for in a coach because, 
I don’t know, it’s kinda like you plan 
on being with that coach for the next 
four years so you kinda just want 
to look for somebody that you can 
relate to and be real down to earth. 
Because you’re gonna spend a while 
with them so that’s a vibe I got from 
him.
I think it’s just all around with 
everything that he does. He plays by 
the rules, he never does anything in 
any grey area, he’s honest, he’s a man 
of his word. And then, I just talked 

to a few players at Michigan at the 
time when I was on my visit and they 
kept it real, they kept it honest with 
me, and they had nothing but good 
things to say about him.

Spike 
Albrecht, 
guard, 
Michigan, 2012-16

I played AAU with Mitch McGary 
and Glenn Robinson, and they were 
both already committed to Michigan 
at the time. So my AAU coach, when 
he started catching wind of this Trey 
Burke situation, he reached out to 
coach Beilein like ‘Hey, I got a guy 
you should look at for a point guard, 
just like insurance policy, basically, 
if Trey leaves. And he was like ‘Hey, 
he doesn’t really look the part but 
you should go give him a call or go 
see him.’ Coach Beilein told me I 
didn’t pass the eyeball test, is what 
he told me. He still tells a story, when 
he came in, he did an in-home visit 
with me back at my house in Crown 
Point and he got out of the car and 
was walking up, I came outside to 
come say ‘hi’ and greet him, welcome 
him into my house. But, like, my 
driveway’s kinda on a slant so he, 
like, got out, and I was on the low 
end, and he was looking at me, and 
he was like, ‘Holy shit, who is this 
little dude. Like, I can’t believe I’m 
gonna recruit this kid to play in the 
Big Ten.’
