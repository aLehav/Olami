Over 
the 
course 
of 
two 

years, 
three 
different 
unions 

— the University of Michigan 
Professional 
Nurse 
Council, 

the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization 
and 
Graduate 

Employees’ Organization — have 
threatened to strike in response to 
budget cuts and staffing levels at 
the University.

LEO President Ian Robinson 

said these incidents are a reaction 
to a broader shift at the University, 
related primarily to what Robinson 
sees as a prioritization of financial 
concerns.

“It’s a new model that is taking 

place at the University,” Robinson 

said. “It is a model that has moved 
from focusing on the interests 
of the public to profit. Really the 
birth of these unions is the result 
of this new model. These strikes 
are the same fight as the fight that 
made these unions form.”

As 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Professional 
Nurse 

Councilprepares to vote on the 
tentative contract agreement with 
the University after 100 days of 
bargaining and an impending 
strike, UMPNC Chief Grievance 
Chair John Armelagos said the 
demands and concerns of nurses 
at the University have not changed 
since the union’s formation in 1974.

The primary motivation behind 

the union’s formation was a need 
to improve working conditions. 
Staff were exposed to an unlimited 

number of consecutive work days, 
multiple shift changes within a 
week and mandatory overtime.

Though in current negotiations 

with Michigan Medicine, nurses 
were able to reach a tentative 
contract 
agreement 
without 
having 

to implement work stoppage, in 
1981 and 1989 hundreds of nurses 
were forced to walk the picket 
line before they could come to a 
satisfactory agreement with the 
administration. In ’81 the nurses 
went on a 3-week strike and in ’89 
the nurses went on a 19-day strike.

Armelagos said he participated 

in the strike of ’89.

“I was active on the picket 

line,” Armelagos said. “The main 
reason we picketed was due to 
mandatory 
overtime. 
Nurses 

were subjected to working in an 

unlimited fashion. The hours that 
nurses were expected to work 
were excessive.”

Anne 
Jackson, 
the 
onsite 

representative for the ambulatory 
care services at the University, 
said she sees connections between 
the strikes of ’81 and ’89 and 
nurses’ demands for their current 
contract.

“The 
common 
thread 
is 

nursing as patient care advocates 
attempting to do the best we can as 
registered nurses,” Jackson said. 
“’81 was about nurses gaining more 
professional economy. In ’89 it was 
about nurses being too exhausted 
to deliver safe care. Today, the 
main issue is also patient care.”

Jackson, who joined as a

speed and high-intensity lasers. 
The University of Michigan

a

within 

the College of Engineering 
that studies the application

other accomplishments, such 
as the 2005 Willis E. Lamb 
Awardfor Laser Science and

Relations, a social justice 
education 
program 

on 
campus, 
facilitates 

workshops 
for 
various 

clubs and organizations to 
teach 
participants 
about 

empathetic communication in 
a multicultural society.

“Today’s training, common 

ground training, is critical 
to our success in helping 
CSG become more inclusive 

and ensuring that we better 
understand intersectionality 
and the role of identities in 
the policy work in efficacy 
we do,” CSG President Daniel

gain 
a 
partisan 
advantage. 

The 
commission 
will 
be 

comprised of four Democrats, 
four 
Republicans 
and 
five 

Independents 
or 
members 

of third-parties. Seven votes 
– including two Democrats, 
two 
Republicans 
and 
two 

Independents – are necessary 
for changing district lines. 

Grassroots 
organizations 

have been pushing for this 
ballot 
proposal 
for 
years, 

especially 
after 
a 
test 
by 

Bridge Magazine that found 
GOP candidates succeed in 
Michigan 
despite 
relatively 

equal support for both parties 
because 
of 
gerrymandered 

districts. In 2017, The Daily 
interviewed Rep. Jeremy Moss 
(D-Southfield), 
one 
of 
the 

supporters of the proposal, 
regarding his efforts to get the 
proposal into legislation.

“It’s very complicated, and 

that’s by design,” Moss said. 
“We wanted to make sure that 
two people couldn’t collude 
and wind up on the commission 
together. Anyone who served as 
a partisan official, worked for 

a partisan official, worked for 
a political party or was a major 
donor to a party or candidate.”

The proposal has received 

support 
from 
Democrats 

throughout the state. Public 
Policy junior Katie Kelly, the 
communications 
director 
of 

the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
was supportive of the idea. She 
believes regardless of partisan 
disagreements, a commission 
will 
generation 
more 
just 

elections. 

“The 
current 
lines 
in 

Michigan are heavily skewed 
towards the Republican party 
and meant to lessen the influence 
that minority, female and young 
voters have in elections,” Kelly 
said. “In other states, the 
opposite is true. Regardless 
of the skew, we support this 
proposal because it would help 
to guarantee fair elections and 
allow all people to have a voice 
in their representation.”

However, 
Kelly 
believes 

Democrats will face strong 
opposition 
on 
the 
issue, 

especially because Republicans 
heavily impacted by the passage 
of Proposal 2.

“Even though this proposal 

would create an even playing 

field 
for 
all 
candidates, 

Republicans will be pushing 
to keep the lines drawn the 
way they are now,” Kelly said. 
“Republicans stand to lose the 
most if the proposal is adopted, 
so I imagine there will be a lot of 
opposition messaging about the 
proposal being too complicated 
and saying that the commission 
is an undemocratic process, 
but neither of those are true. 
Michiganders are smart enough 
to know that when Republicans 
and Democrats get an almost 
equal amount of votes, there 
shouldn’t be such a skewed 
majority.”

Republicans 
have 
indeed 

voiced their disapproval of 
Proposal 2. LSA Sophomore 
Dylan Berger, president of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, 
believes 
an 

appointed citizen commission 
would 
hurt 
the 
state 
of 

democracy within Michigan.

“Currently, 
elected 

representatives of the people 
of Michigan work together to 
determine district lines,” Berger 
said. “If the people are unhappy 
with those lines, they have the 
ability to make their voice heard 
at the ballot box. If this proposal 
passes, 
those 
drawing 
the 

lines would be unelected 
bureaucrats accountable 
to no one … this ballot 
proposal 
would 
make 

our 
state 
government 

less transparent and less 
accountable.”

Berger said he was 

surprised the proposal made it 
through the court system and 
onto the ballot, but believed 
Michiganders would ultimately 
disapprove of it.

“I thought the state Supreme 

Court would have struck this 
down when it came before 
them,” Berger said. “This ballot 
proposal seeks to fundamentally 
alters 
the 
government 
of 

Michigan. Something of that 
magnitude must be decided at a 
state constitutional convention. 
I do not think it will pass. The 
more the people of Michigan 
learn about this, the less likely 
they will be to support it.”

On campus, not all students 

know the details of Proposal 
2, but many still have strong 
opinions about gerrymandering.

LSA freshman Eli Weaver 

believes 
gerrymandering 
is 

a practice both parties are 
guilty of, but said he feels 
the 
Republican 
Party 
has 

done more damage through 
gerrymandering.

“I’m anti-gerrymandering,” 

Weaver said. “I’d call myself 
independent, but I’m probably 
more liberal. I know both sides 
do it (gerrymander), but I think 
it’s a lot more detrimental 
when the Republicans do it. I 
think they do it a lot more to 
segregate minorities, especially 
in southern states like North 
Carolina.”

Proposal 2 will be decided 

upon on Nov. 6 during the 2018 
midterm elections.

was 

approved as a justice for the 
Central Student Judiciary. 
Fakhoury has served on

undergraduate 

advisory 
boards 
and 

identified her ability to 
utilize 
this 
experience 

to 
become 
a

boards. He expressed his 
commitment to making 
the library resources more

“Before I worked there 

I didn’t realize how many

that’s 
something 

a lot of students don’t

Looking at the Numbers

October 3, 1995

Los Angeles (AP) -- O.J 

Simpsons jurors stunned the 
courtroom and the nation 
yesterday by reaching verdict 
in the sensational eight-,o,nth 
murder trial in less than four 
hours. The decision was kept 
secret until today. Simpson, 
apparently as surprised as 
anyone by the swift resolution 
stood biting his lip as the 10 
women and two men of the 
jury filed into court at 2:55 
p.m. He stared at them but 
none looked his way and 
throughout the brief court 
session they kept their eyes on 
the judge.

The decision was announced 

as many Americans were just 
beginning to debate how many 
weeks the jurors might be out. 
Superior Court Judge Lance 
Ito said the verdict would 
be read today at 10 am PDT, 
allowing time for all attorneys 
and families to be there

Among those missing from 

the courtroom yesterday were 
lead prosecutor Marcia Clark 
and chief defense attorneys 
Johnnie Cochran Jr. and 
Robert Shapiro. 

In announcing the startling 

news, Ito said his court clerk 
told him that the panel had 
made its decision. 

“Is that correct?” he asked.

“Yes,” said the jury 

forewoman 

There were gasps in the 

hushed courtroom. 

Lawyers on both sides 

seemed almost dazed. 

“Surprise doesn’t begin to 

describe my feelings. I am 
stunned at the speed,” defense 
attorney Carl Douglas said. 

Prosecutor Christopher 

Darden, asked if he could 
believe the rapid end to 
deliberations said, “I think 

I have to believe it. Its 
happening Nothing shocks me 
anymore.” 

Defense attorney F. Lee, 

who went to visit Simpson in 
jail late yesterday afternoon, 
said he was “delighted” by the 
timing. 

“No jury has ever convicted 

an innocent man this quickly,” 
he said confidently. 

Cochran, interviewed at the 

airport as he returned from 
an out-of-town trip, seemed 
less upbeat saying he was 
“cautiously optimistic.” 

The announcement came 

after jurors asked for and 
heard a repetition of testimony 
from a limousine driver that 
concerned the time when 
Simpson was picked up for a 
ride to the airport on the night 
of the two murders.

Ito, who had sent jurors 

from the courtroom after the 
reading, seemed startled when 
three loud buzzes sounded 
in the courtroom, signaling 
jurors had reached verdicts. 
He was entertaining a group 
of visitors in the courtroom 
when they word came but 
quickly summoned lawyers and 
convened court with ona few 
reporters present.

The jury forewoman also 

appeared a bit rattled asked for 
the verdict forms, she said she 
had signed them, placed them 
in an enveloped, sealed it and 
left them in the deliberation 
room. 

Ito sent her to fetch the 

envelope which was then 
placed in the hands of the 
court bailiff and stored for 
safekeeping. 

At least 20 people were 

detained Tuesday in Detroit 
during the Fight for $15 rally, 
during which hundreds of 
employees, activists and 
leaders marched for union 
rights for fast food workers. 
The national Fight for 
$15 movement advocates for a 
raise in minimum wage to $15 
per hour for fast food, airline, 
and childcare workers, among 
others. The protest aims to 
garner support for pro-union 
candidates in the November 
elections.

WXYZ reported among 

those arrested were former 
Democratic Gubernatorial 
candidate Abdul El-Sayed 
and House of Representative 
candidate Rashida Tlaib, who 
is poised to become the first 
Muslim-American woman in 
Congress. 

Tlaib and El-Sayed were 

arrested after refusing to 
move from a table that was set 
in the middle of Woodward 
Street at the rally. According 
to Detroit Police Deputy Chief 
Elvin Barren, those arrested 
are to receive citations 
for disorderly conduct 
misdemeanors and court 
dates.

El-Sayed tweeted about 

the incident, explaining 
how corporations 
disproportionately distribute 
funding to CEOs and the 
protest cause is worth 
supporting.

“They’re fighting for access 

for something as simple as 
the right to a fair wage for 
the work that they do, and if 
we’re not willing to put our 
own bodies on the line in 
service of that fight, then we 
have to ask ourselves whether 
or not the words mean 
anything,” El-Sayed said. “In 
the face of injustice, descent 
is dignity. And there’s a real 
responsibility we have to fight 

against the system that works 
against so many people.”

In a sister protest 

in Flint, Michigan 
Radio reported eight people 
were hospitalized after a man 
drove his truck into a group 
of protesters in the dark near 
a fast food restaurant. Flint 
Police Chief Tim Johnson said 
he didn’t believe the crash 
was intentional and described 
the driver as “shaken up” after 
the event.

Michigan Gubernatorial 

candidate Gretchen Whitmer 
was at the rally in Flint, and 
expressed her remorse, saying 
she was “incredibly sad.”

currently 
provides 
financial 

support to over 300 active 
student organizations.

“It’s about rewarding the 

student orgs that come back to 
us … and see what impact their 
making,” said Lansey.

CSG discussed a resolution 

to amend its current elections 
code, 
authored 
by 
Medical 

student Whit Froehlich and 
Law student Kevin Deutsch. 
During the CSG assembly held 
last week, the representatives 
addressed the concerns shaping 
their elections. The assembly 
established that CSG’s cannot 
prohibit these distinct separate 
parties 
from 
forming 
in 

elections

However, to improve the 

state 
of 
elections 
within 

their purview, CSG approved 
several 
new 
guidelines. 
A 

separate Elections Court will 
be 
implemented 
to 
address 

future party-related concerns, 
failure to meet deadlines will be 
reprimanded, names on election 
ballots 
will 
be 
randomized 

rather 
than 
alphabetized 

and 
transparent 
campaign 

endorsements will be mandated.

After the approval of this 

resolution, CSG continued its 
conversation on how to better 
its governing body.

The student representatives 

discussed 
a 
resolution 
to 

implement 
a 
definition 
of 

“executive official,” which is 

not included in the current 
CSG 
Constitution. 
Froehlich 

and Rackham student Sammi 
Meister proposed a resolution.

“This lack of clarity hinders 

the President’s ability to staff 
the 
Executive 
branch,” 
the 

students wrote.

In an effort to hear more 

student voices, CSG discussed 
a 
resolution 
to 
re-establish 

elected 
representative 
office 

hours. 
The 
author 
of 
the 

resolution, Benjamin Gerstein, 
an 
LSA 
sophomore, 
looked 

to 
the 
LSA 
and 
Rackham 

Student Governments’ policies 
to shape those of CSG. Both 
LSA SG and RSG require each 
elected representative to hold 
office 
hours 
to 
meet 
with 

their constituents, which has 
improved 
their 
respective 

reaches with the students they 
are representing.

This resolution was passed 

and will now require CSG 
elected representatives to hold 
monthly office hours to speak 
with students and hear their 
opinions 
and 
perspectives. 

CSG plans to measure the 
effectiveness of their office 
hours 
by 
surveying 
both 

students who attended and the 
representatives.

“Central 
Student 

Government’s . . . mission is 
to 
encourage 
student 
civic 

engagement, 
give 
voices

transportation inhibited many 
students from receiving local 
health care services.

“One clear solution was 

to have UHS offer these 
services,” Parish wrote in an 
email. “We’ve been working 
hard 
to 
design 
processes, 

train staff and make changes 
to the UHS environment (like 
gender-inclusive forms and 
bathrooms) in collaboration 
with CAPS, Spectrum Center 
and of course trans and non-
binary students themselves.”

Parish said access to reliable 

health 
care 
can 
improve 

mental health and quality of 
life for transgender and non-
binary students.

“These new UHS services 

are a very welcome addition 
to the network of support 
U-M is able to offer our trans 
and 
non-binary 
students,” 

Parish wrote. “Since we began 
advertising UHS Trans Care 
Services 
during 
Welcome 

Week, I have heard from 
many trans and non-binary 
students who are interested in 
learning more and scheduling 
appointments.”

UHS 
physician 
Rachelle 

Wilcox described how the 
Trans Care Team will combat 
health disparities impacting 
members of the trans and non-
binary community experience 
due 
to 
marginalization, 

oppression and violence.

“We hope that offering 

accessible, affirming health 
care to our trans and non-
binary 
students 
will 
help 

complement 
the 
other 

services available to them 
through our campus partners 
and contribute to a culture 
of support and inclusion on 
campus,” Wilcox said.

TransForm 
Tech 
Chair 

Jay Hash, an Engineering 
junior, said the new UHS 
services make transitioning 
more accessible for students. 
TransForm, 
an 
advocacy 

and support group for trans 
and non-gender conforming 
people, 
helps 
connect 

transgender 
students 
with 

resources.

“For the people who want 

to pursue a medical transition, 
(the Trans Care Team) makes 
it much easier for them,” Hash 
said. “Making formal therapy 
accessible to trans people on 
campus is important because 
there 
are 
people 
coming 

from all over the world and 
all over the country so they 
might not have access to that 
… For people who think that 
hormone therapy is not an 
option at home, they can come 
to the University and get it 
here.”

Hash 
said 
he 
will 
be 

transferring 
their 
medical 

care to UHS because it is more 
accessible. However, Hash is 
concerned the new services 
might 
pressure 
students, 

who may be uncertain of 
transitioning, 
to 
transition 

because of its easy campus 
accessibility.

“There are trans people 

who do not want to medically 
transition and it may put 
pressure on them; but for 
people who do, it is a very good 
service and is very helpful,” 
Hash said “Those who do not 
want to medically transition 
might feel pressure to do so 
because the University makes 
it possible.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Jordan 

Furr, a transgender student, 
disagrees with the comment 
that this may add pressure 
for transgender students to 
transition.

“It’s 
not 
like 
they 
are 

advertising for their team,” 
Furr said. “So in a way you 
only find out about them if 
you identify being trans and 
are looking for the resources. 
So 
anyone 
who 
already 

found them might want to 
transition.”

Furr said he will be also 

shift his medical care from 
Detroit to UHS. He is glad 
UHS 
is 
becoming 
more 

trans-friendly 
but 
still 

feels 
the 
health 
services 

could be more sensitive to 
the trans community. Furr 
said UHS often uses the 
wrong names and pronouns, 
adding it would be helpful 
for the health services to be 
more 
conscientious, 
from 

receptionists to doctors.

Furr was first directed to 

the Trans Care Team when 
he received a testosterone 

prescription but did not know 
how to inject it. He said the 
health care providers were 
helpful and provided advice 
and resources.

“I think that (the Trans 

Care Team) helps,” Furr said. 
“From talking to other people, 

I know it’s a good resource. I 
know another guy who is doing 
it, and my friend sees one of 
the doctors and they are all 
really nice, understanding and 
accepting, and it’s important 
because if we are paying so 
much to go here we should at 
least have doctors that know 
what they are doing.”

nurse at the University in 1984, 
said the main difference between 
previous strikes and the nurses’ 
current 
efforts, 
however, 
is 

communication.

“Back then, because we didn’t 

have the same technology to be 
able to communicate that we have 
today, I don’t think we were as 
aware of what was going on at the 
bargaining table,” Jackson said. 

Armelagos said through the 

years UMPNC has worked to 
build a positive relationship with 
hospital administration, but over 
time, with the development of new 
bargaining techniques, the nurses’ 
relationship with the hospital has 
eroded.

“We built the respect that got 

us 
interest-based 
bargaining,” 

Armelagos said. “We built the 
respect to work as equal partners 
with the University. (Interest-
based bargaining) motivated the 
two parties to come together and 
work together.”

Interest-based bargaining is a 

problem-solving approach during 
which the two parties jointly define 
the issues, brainstorm solutions 
and seek creative solutions that 
address shared interests. Unlike 
traditional bargaining, interest-
based bargaining does not involve 
coercion, instead relying on both 
parties seeking to fulfill each 
other’s interests.

Armelagos explained during 

negotiations between the nurses 

and 
the 
administration 
in 

2001, 2004, 2008 and 2011, the 
University 
employed 
interest-

based bargaining techniques.

“The 
parties 
tried 
to 

understand and appreciate the 
other’s perspective,” Armelagos 
said. “If one side had a problem, 
the other side had one too.”

Armelagos said the hospital 

owes its success to the unity that 
was developed between the nurses 
and the administration through 
interest-based bargaining.

“That’s how we gained magnet 

status,” Armelagos said. “It was a 
dual partnership. When you have 
a strong union, nurses can stand 
up for their patients, but a strong 
union makes it more difficult for 
a corporate hospital. Our bottom 
line is the patients, the hospitals 
bottom line should be the patients. 
Make no mistake, now, there is 
a new regime in place that has 
no interest in an interest-based 
process.”

One of the main differences 

Armelagos and Jackson cited 
in current negotiations was the 
hospital’s treatment of the nurses 
during the bargaining process. 
Jackson said it was particularly 
disheartening for nurses when 
they had to file an unfair labor 
charge.

“This particular work stoppage 

vote is especially about how we 
were treated at the bargaining 
table,” Jackson said.

The nurses filed the charge 

against Michigan Medicine for 
prohibiting them from wearing 
their red union shirts and pro-

union buttons.

Lecturers’ concerns
While LEO, an organization 

representing nearly 1,700 non-
tenure track faculty members 
across the University’s three 
campuses, did not have to file an 
unfair labor charge Robinson 
believes LEO and the UMPNC 
represent similar issues at the 
University.

“Both 
unions 
represent 

employees that are very oriented 
to the people they provide their 
services to,” Robinson said. “It’s 
very care-oriented work and there 
are a lot of overlapping interests 
between the two groups.”

When LEO authorized a strike 

for April 9, they were bargaining 
with the University for salary 
increases.

At the time, the minimum 

starting salary for a U-M lecturer 
was $34,500 in Ann Arbor, 
$28,300 in Dearborn and $27,300 
in Flint. LEO asked the minimum 
be raised to $60,000 in Ann Arbor 
and $56,000 in Dearborn and 
Flint. After bargaining for months 
with the University when LEO’s 
contract expired May 29, LEO 
voted to ratify a new contract 
that included a significant salary 
increase.

By 
September 
2020, 
the 

minimum salary at which the 
University can hire lecturers will 
increase across the three campus. 
In Ann Arbor, the base salary 
will increase 47.8 percent from 
$34,500 to $51,000. In Flint, there 
will be a 50.2 percent increase 
from $27,300 to $41,000. Finally, 

in Dearborn, the starting salary 
will increase 44.9 percent from 
$28,300 to $41,000.

Robinson said LEO owes the 

success of its new contract to the 
imminent threat posed by work 
stoppage.

“It (the impending strike) made 

a very big difference in the case of 
LEO,” Robinson said. “In fact, I 
would say that was the first time 
the administration began to take 
us seriously and bargaining began 
to move in the right direction.”

Graduate students’ concerns
Similarly, in April 2017 the 

Graduate Employee Organization, 
a union representing graduate 
student instructors and graduate 
student staff at the University, 
authorized a walkout in an effort 
to create paid positions and 
guarantee union protection for 
graduate students working on 
diversity programs as part of the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan.

The University launched the 

five-year DEI plan in October 
2016 to achieve a more diverse and 
equitable campus, which some 
have criticized for a lack of swift 
action.

Current GEO President Emily 

Gauld said the union decided 
collective 
graduate 
student 

action was the only way to get 
the administration to take their 
concerns seriously.

“Our walkout authorization 

showed we were willing to fight 
for it in a very real and tangible 
way,” Gauld said. “It showed the 
graduate students were willing to 

take action to see the changes that 
we believe are necessary.”

While University spokesman 

Rick Fitzgerald was unable to 
comment on negotiations with 
the UMPNC as the nurses are 
still voting on the contract, he 
said the University does not make 
bargaining decisions based on 
threats.

“The university does not believe 

a strike or the threat of a strike is 
necessary to move the negotiations 
toward a settlement,” Fitzgerald 
wrote in an email interview. “We 
also do not believe a strike or the 
threat of a strike influences the 
final, negotiated settlement. We 
also need to point out that under 
state law, labor strikes by public 
employees are prohibited.”

Much 
as 
the 
UMPNC 

and LEO reached a tentative 
agreement shortly after the strike 
authorizations, Gauld says GEO 
reached a tentative agreement the 
day before the walkout was set to 
take place.

Ultimately, Gauld said the 

number of walkout authorizations 
that have occurred over the course 
of two years is a positive sign for 
unions at the University.

“It is really exciting to see 

increased 
labor 
organization,” 

Gauld said. “The strength of 
unions is increasing, especially 
at the University of Michigan. 
Unions are becoming more united 
even in the face of institutions that 
seek to divide unions and I think 
that is powerful.”

“These new UHS 

services are a 
very welcome 
addition to the 

network of 

support U-M is 
able to offer our 
trans and non-
binary students,”

more than $1 million award 
with 
Donna 
Strickland, 

Canadian physicist and 2013 
director of the Optical Society 
of America, while the other half 
was awarded to Arthur Ashkin, 
an affiliate of Bell Laboratories 
in New Jersey. Mourou and 
Strickland 
published 
an 

article 
in 
1985 
on 
their 

development of the chirped 
pulse amplification, a process 
that creates short and intense 
laser pulses through stretching 
and 
quickly 
compressing 

light matter. These pulses are 
now widely applied for the 
industrial and medical uses, 
including laser eye surgery.

Ashkin received the award 

for his work developing optical 
tweezers that utilize laser light 
to maneuver tiny particles, 
such as viruses. At age 96, he is 
the oldest Nobel laureate.

In a video statement released 

by 
Ecole 
Polytechnique, 

a 
top 
French 
college, 

Mourou explained the effects 
of their achievement.

“It’s something that sort of 

never happens at this level. I 
am very, very happy to share 
this distinction with my former 
student 
Donna 
Strickland 

and also to share it with Art 
Ashkin, for whom I have a lot 
of respect … We invented a 
technique that made the laser 
extremely powerful. With the 
technology we have developed, 
laser power has been increased 
about a million times, maybe 
even a billion.”

Strickland 
is 
the 
first 

woman to receive the Nobel 
Prize in physics since Maria 
Goeppert Mayer in 1963, who 
was awarded for her work in 
nuclear physics. The only other 
woman to receive this award 
was Marie Curie in 1903. In 
a interview with the academy 
after the award announcement, 
Strickland 
highlighted 
the 

importance 
of 
recognizing 

female physicists and their 
achievements.

“Obviously 
we 
need 
to 

celebrate 
women 
physicists, 

because 
we’re 
out 
there,” 

Strickland said. “Hopefully in 
time it’ll start to move forward 
at a faster rate, maybe.”

Michael Moloney, CEO of 

the 
American 
Institute 
of 

Physics, congratulated all of 
the laureates and expressed 
support of Strickland’s work 
and achievements.

“It is also a personal delight 

to see Dr. Strickland break the 
55-year hiatus since a woman 
has been awarded the Nobel 
Prize in physics, making this 
year’s award all the more 
historic.”

oo often women neglect 
the sexism we ourselves 
propagate. It is easy to 
blame day-to-day adversities on 
the patriarchy when it is such an 
obvious source of culpability. From 
people like Harvey Weinstein 
and Brett Kavanaugh to issues 
like the wage gap and paid 
maternity leave, it seems as 
though the news cycle is teeming 
with examples of powerful men 
suppressing 
women’s 
freedom 
and autonomy. While these stories 
are undoubtedly important and 
justifiably 
attention-grabbing, 
they often overshadow other 
smaller, but nevertheless profound 
sources of sexism — those not at 
the hands of power-seeking men 
but instead at the hands of fellow 
women.
Recently, an anonymously 
written 
document 
began 
circulating around campus in 
which a former University of 
Michigan student describes 
her 
experience 
as 
the 
sorority recruitment chair. 
She shares intimate details 
of 
her 
chapter’s 
archaic 
and 
impossible 
standards 
for acceptance and outlines 
specific 
implementations 
including “Chapter Scores” 
and “Coffee Dates” used to 
judge potential new members 
and pledges.
Perhaps most troubling, 
but also least surprising, is 
the confidential rating system 
described in the document 
which supposedly measures 
how well a potential new 
member “fits” in the sorority. 
A system in which girls are 
reduced to a singular number 
is degrading in itself, but 
it is the criterion by which 
sorority sisters assign these 
ratings that are especially 
disturbing.
In 
this 
unnamed 
chapter, recruits are rated 
based 
on 
whether 
they 
remind 
the 
sisters 
of 
a 
current 
sorority 
member. 
This 
policy 
is 
extremely 
regressive and problematic. 
While not explicitly stated, 
the 
recruitment 
process 
essentially 
boils 
down 
to 
girls judging other girls in 
order to preserve traditional 
standards of femininity.

At its core, sororities exist to 
build community. For some, they 
make a school of nearly 40,000 
students seem a little less 
intimidating. For others, they 
offer a sense of community and 
pride. But, as reflected in this 
anonymous exposé, the rush 
process can also be a breeding 
ground for toxic expectations 
that 
warp 
girls’ 
sense 
of 
confidence 
and 
self-worth. 
Regardless of how daintily it is 
phrased, sorority recruitment is 
a game of conformity.
The adversities women face 
in society usually boil down to 
the inability to recognize women 
as complex beings; the sorority 
recruitment process embodies 
this principle despite the fact that 
it is entirely managed by females. 

With just a few five-minute 
conversations, new recruits are 
judged, assigned a value and 
passed on to the next house. On 
the recruit’s side, this experience 
is incredibly daunting. With 
just a few minutes, she must 
be confident and affable, but 
most of all memorable. On the 
other side, sorority sisters must 
sort through hundreds of girls 
and decide who will receive 
a bid based on just a few brief 
memories and superficial details.
In the field of psychology, 
there is a phenomenon called the 
halo effect. It is a cognitive bias 
in which a single trait — such as 
one’s physical attractiveness — 
affects the overall perception of 
the person. Rushing a sorority is 
like the halo effect on steroids. 
It is impossible to fairly gauge 
anyone’s “fit” during the Greek 
life recruitment process, so, 
naturally, outward appearance 
is equated with social worth, 
while more telling qualities take 
a back seat. Whether sororities 

measure the value of these girls 
based on a numerical system or 
not is almost irrelevant. One way 
or another, they must decide 
who to accept and who to turn 
away in a painfully short time 
span. The only way to do this is 
to participate in oversimplified 
and often sexist profiling.
Among the thousands who 
have participated in the Greek 
life recruitment process are 
girls with a wealth of different 
aesthetics, 
backgrounds 
and 
interests. It is these nuances 
that define who we are. It is 
these nuances that determine 
where we truly “fit.” But, when 
fall comes around, new recruits 
assemble by the hundreds to 
assume their most traditionally 
feminine selves, tucking away 
their most salient qualities in 
the process.
We are all entitled to our 
own identities. We are allowed 
to be as classically feminine 
as we want to be. We can like 
dresses and makeup and cute 
tailgate outfits. But when we 
assign expectations and social 
values to others based on our 
own perceptions of femininity, 
we give rise to the same sexism 
we face in the workplace, 
academia 
and 
general 
society. Sorority recruitment 
institutionalizes this sexism. 
Not only does it reduce girls to 
one-dimensional beings, but it 
also perpetuates the concept 
of an “ideal” woman, favoring 
traditional beauty over its more 
unconventional forms.
Feminism is not as simple 
as just standing up to the 
patriarchy. Achieving gender 
equality 
in 
greater 
society 
begins with believing in it 
ourselves. 
Girls, 
especially 
those in sororities, need to 
support each other, but too 
often it is the opposite that 
occurs. Too often we reduce 
our fellow women to simpler 
beings and are quick to judge 
each 
other 
based 
on 
our 
differences. 
Sororities 
and 
women, in general, need to 
hold ourselves to a higher 
standard. We are interesting

Embrace the nuclear option
A

ny contender for the 
Democratic presidential 
nomination 
in 
2020 
should 
support 
packing 
the 
Supreme Court — that is, voting 
to expand the maximum number 
of seats so the president can 
confirm a liberal majority.
Yes, moderate liberals will 
wring their hands and grieve yet 
again the death of civility, but 
they’ll forget with time. Especially 
on the national level, where news 
outlets breathlessly report news 
with unsettling dramatic flair, 
the average liberal is frustratingly 
gullible. President George W. Bush 
gives Michelle Obama a piece of 
hard candy and suddenly he’s a 
sweet old man who likes to paint, 
not a two-term president who 
initiated war in Iraq and systemic 
torture at “black site” prisons.
That’s 
beside 
the 
point, 
though. 
There 
are 
risks 
to 
nominating extreme candidates, 
but presidential elections have 
functioned in a fundamentally 
different way from House of 
Representatives 
and 
Senate 
elections for some time now. 
Throughout 2015 and the first 
months 
of 
2016, 
Republican 
commentators bleated at their 
party’s primary voters to choose 
someone 
other 
than 
Donald 
Trump 
or 
Ted 
Cruz, 
both 
personally repellant extremists. 
A few months later, many were 
on the Trump train — by summer, 
those who wavered at all in their 
support for the nominee were 
outcasts. Moderates and party-
leaning centrists always bend the 
knee, if you manage to sufficiently 
beat them first and especially if 
your candidate is an inspirational, 
larger-than-life figure like Barack 
Obama or Trump.
#TheResistance 
has 
been 
kindling liberal outrage against 
Trump since Nov. 9, 2016, and the 
Democratic Party’s 2020 strategy 
is almost guaranteed to be focused 
on many people’s personal disgust 
with the president. Packing the 
Supreme Court would just be 
another 
manifestation 
of 
this 

strategy; I don’t see why it has to 
be considered especially shocking 
or extreme. If Trump (and his 
Supreme Court nominees, whoever 
they end up being) are as dangerous 
as we’re told day in and day out, it 
seems reasonable to me that the 
countermeasures be proportional.
The virtue of bipartisanship is 
a vestige of the mid-20th century, 
when 
the 
Democratic 
Party 
maintained unbroken control over 
the House for 40 years. A substantial 
portion of their members were 
Southern conservatives; reaching 
across the aisle was necessary for 
Congress to accomplish anything, 
given 
that 
both 
parties 
(but 
especially the Democratic Party) 
were fractured ideologically by 
geography and race. The sorting 
(and 
subsequent 
decline 
of 
bipartisanship) that has occurred 
in recent years isn’t an affirmation 
or violation of some abstract moral 
code, it’s just a political phenomena.
A serious issue is that Trump 
is certain to confirm a five-justice 
majority on the court, and given 
the health of some liberal justices – 
Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Breyer – he 
might further increase that majority. 
Any Democratic president —whether 
they win in 2020, 2024 or later—
doesn’t just need power in the House 
and Senate, they need their legislation 
to survive legal challenges.
The Affordable Care Act nearly 
died in the Supreme Court, and it 
was just a watered-down version 
of a Heritage Foundation plan 
supported by former Presidential 
nominee 
Mitt 
Romney. 
If 
a 
Democratic government were to 
implement some kind of public 
option or Medicare expansion, 
what’s 
to 
stop 
the 
solidly 
conservative Supreme Court from 
striking it down? If a Democratic 
government tried to repair voting 
rights, implement countermeasures 
against 
gerrymandering 
or 
revitalize worker’s rights, what’s to 
stop five conservatives on the court 
from neutralizing it?
One suggested difficulty with 
breaking the norms that keep the 
current number of Supreme Court 

seats at nine — though there have 
been greater and fewer in the past — is 
that when the Republican Party takes 
power again, it will likewise pack the 
court with party loyalists. One can see 
how this easily spirals so the Supreme 
Court shrugs off its last threads of 
partisan neutrality and becomes an 
openly political institution.
This strikes me as useful, 
though — part of the appeal of 
court packing is that it would 
accelerate the collapse and reform 
of an institution already in the first 
stages of decay. The delay of former 
Supreme Court nominee Merrick 
Garland’s confirmation was one 
violation; the removal of the 
Senate filibuster on Supreme Court 
nominees was another. Norms 
about the Supreme Court are 
already falling apart to the benefit 
of Republicans — in steadfastly 
maintaining 
faith, 
Democrats 
welcome their own defeat.
Mistakes have already been 
made — Justices Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg 
and 
Stephen 
Breyer 
should have both stepped aside 
for younger replacements in 2013, 
when Democrats still held the 
Senate. 
Lifetime 
appointment, 
though, encourages every justice 
to cling to his or her seat for as long 
as possible, and now concerned 
liberals have to engage in macabre 
speculation 
about 
whether 
Ginsburg can stave off death long 
enough for a Democrat to win the 
presidency in 2020.
The Supreme Court as it exists 
is unwieldy, arcane and filled with 
negative incentives — the start of a 
solution is to pack the courts. When 
Democrats venerate tradition and 
trust in the unwillingness of their 
opponents to violate norms, they 
don’t just risk losing a partisan 
game, they risk the overturn of 
policy protecting basic American 
freedoms. 
Any 
Democratic 
candidate for president should be 
willing to endorse a strategy of 
packing the court.

throughout the two days of 
proceedings, one thing struck 
me most of all: She was 15 when 
Brett Kavanaugh locked her 
in a room and assaulted her, 
covering her mouth so she could 
not scream for help.
My sister is 15.
As I listened to Ford recount the 
horrific incident of 36 years ago, 
my breath caught in my throat as I 
tried to wrap my mind around this 
happening to someone my sister’s 
age — of this happening to my sister.
My sister is passionate and strong-
willed, with stronger and more 
eloquently expressed opinions than a 
great deal of my peers four years elder 
and more educated. She is hilarious 
and vibrant. She is unapologetically 
and unequivocally herself. She is 
extraordinarily kind, compassionate 
and thoughtful. I think if you asked 
her to describe herself, feminist 
would be high on her list — and 
rightly so. She, too, is brimming with 
opinions and outrage about these 
proceedings. But my most principal 
thought throughout the proceedings 
was that this could happen to her.

Watching Ford discuss the assault 
she endured and the trauma that 
follows her to this day, I thought of 
my sister. Ford struggled for years 
with friendships and academics. 
She has two front doors due to 
the claustrophobia that resulted 
from her assault. Unaddressed and 
undiscussed but, I think, wholly 
relevant and uncoincidentally, as 
a survivor of sexual assault with 
lasting mental health implications, 
she has dedicated her life to the 
study of psychology. Ford’s sexual 
assault changed her life. It changed 
who she is as a person in countless, 
immeasurable ways. At such an 
integral point in adolescence and 
development, 
she 
was 
forever 
changed because she was sexually 
assaulted by Kavanaugh.
At such a pivotal age — 15 — 
my sister is different and more 
mature every time I come home 
from school. One of my most 
miraculous 
and 
rewarding 
experiences has been witnessing 
my sister become the young 
woman she is, and it blows my 
mind to think about how much 
she has changed. I am powerless 
in her protection against such 
a vicious act, and can only hope 
and pray to a divine power I 
don’t believe in that she will be 
able to continue to grow and 
flourish without anything like 

this happening to her. But it could 
happen to her. It could happen 
to 
anyone. 
Currently, 
sexual 
violence will happen to one in 
three women in her lifetime. One 
in four women will be sexually 
abused before they turn 18.
With Kavanaugh, with Brock 
Turner, with men who stand accused 
of sexual assault, we hear that they are 
“just boys.” That these accusations 
will ruin their reputations and 
lives. That it happened 36 years 
ago. Accused perpetrators of sexual 
violence have a tendency to use the 
plights they go through as a result 
of their committed assaults to turn 
themselves into victims. More often 
than not, society allows it.
But what about the women? Ford 
was just a girl. For her and many 
other victims of sexual assault, 
their lives are ruined from the 
moment these “boys” feel entitled 
to treat women as objects for their 
own pleasure. Women are faulted 
for not reporting incidents and not 
being believed when they do report 
them. They are confined to silent 
victimhood, their lives forever 
altered, in a society that time and 
time again believes men.

T

he 2018 Emmy Awards 
aired on Sept. 17, 2018 
and made history with 
the most diverse group of 
nominees ever. Twenty percent 
more non-white actors were 
nominated this year than last, 
with 36 nominations going to 
people of color. These figures 
brought many inside and outside 
of the Hollywood community 
hope for a positive trend toward 
inclusion and representation. 
There were some significant 
wins, with three people of color 
awarded for the categories 
Outstanding 
Lead 
Actress 
in a Limited Series (Regina 
King), Outstanding Supporting 
Actress (Thandie Newton) and 
Outstanding Lead Actor in a 
Limited Series (Darren Criss — 
a University of Michigan alum 
who is half-Filipino, though 
does not directly identify as 
Asian 
American). 
Presented 
a week before at the Creative 
Arts Emmy Awards Show, all 
four guest actor categories 
were won by African American 
actors: 
Tiffany 
Haddish, 
Ron 
Cephas 
Jones, 
Samira 
Wiley 
and 
Katt 
Williams. 
These wins are significant, 
deserving and promising. The 
increased diversity is definitely 
something to be celebrating.
However, 
as 
the 
Emmys 
progressed, it became clear this 
great increase in nomination did 
not directly equate to winning. 
At the Primetime Emmy Awards, 
which are covered vastly more 
than the Creative Arts Emmys, 
the three wins listed above were 
the only people of color award 
recipients of the night. People of 
color found themselves all over 
the presentation stage, though, 
and the night was filled with 
diversity-fueled commentary by 
hosts and guests alike. This made 
the disparity even more obvious. 
The talent and performances of 
white winners were laudable, 
but the need to focus on the ever-
prominent issue of inclusion and 
then have a show that scarcely 
recognizes the talent of diverse 
actors feels like positive dialogue 

with limited action.
The push for greater diversity 
in Hollywood became especially 
popular in the wake of the 
2015 and 2016 Oscar Awards 
when no Black actors received 
nominations. This started the 
popular social media movement 
#OscarsSoWhite, 
which 
has 
been transferred to Hollywood 
as a whole, targeting other 
celebrations 
and 
recognition 
shows like the Emmys. Since the 
growth of discussion surrounding 
the topic of Hollywood inclusion, 
diversity has become prominent 
in 
the 
awards 
presentation 
writing, as made evident by the 
many jokes and two significant 
sketches in this year’s Emmys.
Kenan 
Thompson 
and 
Kate McKinnon, later joined 
by Sterling K. Brown, Tituss 
Burgess, Kristen Bell, Ricky 
Martin, 
RuPaul 
and 
John 
Legend, led a musical number 
titled 
“We 
Solved 
It.” 
It 
functions as a reference to 
diversity but also takes tackles 
sexual assault in the midst of the 
#MeToo movement. Thompson 
and McKinnon congratulate the 
Emmys for having the greatest 
amount of nomination diversity 
ever but go on to sarcastically 
respond to those who have 
championed this fact as a signal 
of the end of the fight. The sketch 
opened an important dialogue 
about victories, explaining these 
advancements 
are 
vital and 
should be celebrated, but do not 
indicate the end of the battle.
Michael Che, who co-hosted 
with Colin Jost, also presented 
a 
pre-taped 
sketch 
titled 
“Reparation Emmys,” where he 
presented Emmys to African 
American actors who he felt 
should be recognized for their 
past work. This bit included 
Marla 
Gibbs 
from 
“The 
Jeffersons,” 
Jimmie 
Walker 
from “Good Times,” Kadeem 
Hardison from “A Different 
World” and other prominent 
Black actors. This was another 
timely sketch that highlighted 
the lack of recognition of diverse 
talent in the past, which can 

be easily translated into our 
improving, 
yet 
struggling, 
culture of inclusion.
The need to support art is 
crucial to our culture, but the 
art that we see does not always 
match what real life is. As a 
white woman, I have always 
had my story told. I have seen 
examples of people like me and 
been able to model myself after 
the plethora of women who 
paved the way in film, television 
and the media. But there are so 
many other stories that need to 
be told. Representation matters 
to people. The Michigan Daily 
had 
two 
wonderful 
pieces 
published this fall in the wake of 
popular films “To All the Boys I 
Loved Before” and “Crazy Rich 
Asians” that discuss the issue 
of representation in a more 
authentic light. Amanda Zhang’s 
“More than just a teen romance” 
and Chelsea Racelis’ “So sayang: 
A mother & daughter’s review 
of Crazy Rich Asians” describe 
what representation means and 
should look like better than I 
ever could. But what I do know is 
everybody deserves to see their 
identity and culture in the media, 
and the actors and executives 
who make that happen deserve 
recognition for their work.
Though 
the 
conversation 
about diversity is reaching peak 
levels, the issue of inclusion is far 
from solved. The growing tension 
about the topic is important 
and 
the 
continual 
dialogue 
about increasing diversity and 
representation is significant, but 
the small gains do not mean that 
we can or should stop fighting 
for more. Since the birth of 
celebrity culture 100 years ago, 
there has been institutionalized 
discrimination and the talent 
of people of color has not been 
recognized. This is an issue for 
our entire society. The system 
is not going to be fixed in a few 
awards seasons. Make diversity a 
priority and keep fighting.

of Celine had to offer.
It offered nothing.
Though Slimane unleashed 
a whopping 96 looks for his 
inaugural collection, not one 
showed 
visible 
recognition 
of the house’s past. Rather 
than acknowledge any aspect 
of Celine’s rich, matriarchal 
heritage, Slimane used the 
platform it gave him to pay 
homage 
to 
himself. 
Look 
number 
one, 
a 
shoulder-
bearing, polka dot shift with 
a massive bow motif, was 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
heart-
shaped cape he designed in 
2016. Sharp-shouldered suit 
jackets and tapered slacks 
reproduced 
Saint 
Laurent’s 
favored menswear silhouette. 
Skirts 
were 
short. 
Boots 
were made of black leather, 
accented 
with 
buckles 
and 
zippers. 
Sequins 
and 
sunglasses 
abound. 
Models 
stomped through the venue 

to a throbbing techno beat, 
about as enthused as a crew of 
high school stoners forced to 
attend a pep rally. Objectively, 
everything 
looked 
fine, 
but this was not the Celine 
anybody knew or loved. It was 
simply Slimane, doing as he 
has always done.
Why was Hedi being Hedi 
suddenly 
offensive 
in 
this 
context? 
For 
starters, 
he 
entered a 73-year-old company 
with no regard for the legacy 
left by his predecessors, opting 
instead to mansplain his way 
through 
the 
Celine 
name, 
both literally by removing 
the 
accent, 
posthumously 
stripping 
founder 
Céline 
Vipiana of her power, and 
figuratively through his stale 
designs. Slimane doesn’t care 
what the 2018 Celine woman 
wants, or that what was cool 
in his Saint Laurent days can 
be 
interpreted 
completely 
differently 
in 
the 
present 
political climate. Philo’s Celine 
was a tribute to the wants 
and needs of a customer she 
deeply understood. Here was 
an 
overzealous, 
privileged 
man throwing that all by the 
wayside, shamelessly using his 
resources and clout to push 
forward a problematic agenda.
Sounds an awful lot like 
a 
certain 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee.
It’s a shame that an attempt 
to dismantle Philo’s legacy 
happened 
in 
tandem 
with 
the 
Kavanaugh 
hearings, 
but the parallels were clear 
as day. Tweet after tweet, 
thinkpiece after thinkpiece, 
has considered the collection 
within a feminist framework. 
Leandra Medine, founder of 
the fashion blog Man Repeller, 
titled her melancholic review 
“Why 
It 
Matters 
When 
Designers Ignore What Women 
Want.” 
Fashion 
journalist 
Booth Moore went so far as 
to brand Slimane “the Donald 
Trump of fashion” in a recent 
article for The Hollywood 
Reporter.
“To some people for whom 
buying a $4000 coat designed 
by a woman was somehow 

perceived to be a feminist act, 
the storyline may be familiar: 
rob a female of a job she seemed 
perfect for, and replace her 
with a man who burns down 
the 
house,” 
Moore 
wrote. 
“You almost have to wonder if 
LVMH, seeing the contentious 
landscape before them, knew 
this.”
Clearly, Dr. Ford’s testimony 
deserved 
more 
attention 
than 
Paris 
Fashion 
Week, 
but 
consider 
this: 
As 
we 
watched a posse of archaic 
senators dismiss a woman’s 
recounting 
of 
her 
assault, 
a 
Parisian 
clothier 
once 
viewed as the pinnacle of 
female 
empowerment 
was 
turned 
into 
a 
parade 
of 
white-washed models clad in 
slinky 
numbers 
remarkable 
only for their exposure of 
thighs. Fashion is political. 
Nothing is coincidence. Both 
the 
Kavanaugh 
hearings 
and 
Slimane’s 
tone-deaf 
Celine debut are signs of the 
times. We are living in the 
age of pervasive disregard 
for 
women’s 
experiences, 
whether they come in the form 
of artistic achievements or 
searing trauma.
“Ultimately, the clothes at 
Celine are a continuation of 
what Slimane was doing at 
Saint Laurent — a style that 
proved to be lucrative for the 
house,” wrote Robin Givhan in 
her review for The Washington 
Post. “During his tenure there, 
Slimane 
generated 
double-
digit, 
year-to-year 
growth. 
But nearly two years have 
passed since Slimane left Saint 
Laurent. In that short time, the 
fashion industry has changed 
and so has the broader culture.”
Hedi 
Slimane 
needs 
to 
wake up and smell the post-
apocalyptic roses. Like many 
of 
our 
current 
decision-
makers in American politics, 
he has soiled a sense of female 
liberation that generations of 
women have worked tirelessly 
to build up.
The 
worst 
part? 
Like 
Kavanaugh, Slimane is either 
lying or has no recollection of 
the harm he’s done.

Wednesday, October 3, 2018 — 5A

I am in a group chat with two 
of my fellow fashion enthusiast 
friends. 
Despite 
harboring 
interest in what’s consistently 
touted as a shallow industry, 
each of us is an avid believer in 
the intersection of the personal 
and the political. We’re also all 
staunch Democrats.
When Dr. Christine Blasey 
Ford 
took 
the 
stand 
last 
Thursday to testify against 
Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme 
Court 
nominee 
who 
she 
says sexually assaulted her, 
we stopped what we were 
doing and tuned in from our 
respective 
locations. 
Every 
time 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee called for a break, 
we 
reconvened 
via 
text 
message.
Through our discussion of 
Ford’s remarkable composure 
and 
Kavanaugh’s 
boyish 
temper, 
one 
particular 
comment shone through. “I 
can’t imagine being at Paris 
Fashion Week right now,” one 
of my friends wrote. “With all 
of this happening, the shows 
seem so unimportant.”
At the time, I felt the same 
sense of disdain for the fashion 
set, those I would have admired 
in any other circumstance. “I 
couldn’t agree more,” I replied 
without a second thought. 
Clothes were significant in 
their own right, but nothing 
they could convey was worth 
shifting my attention away 
from the American political 
sphere, even for a moment.
The very next day, I was 
proven wrong. On Friday, Sept. 
28, day five of Paris Fashion 
Week’s 
Spring-Summer 
2019 season, Hedi Slimane 
sent his debut collection for 
Celine 
down 
the 
runway. 
Everything about it was cold, 
hard evidence for fashion’s 
role in representing a singular 
moment 
within 
the 
global 
moral 
landscape. 
In 
this 
case, that moment was sad, 
demeaning and, in the eyes of 
some, downright hopeless.
Slimane served as creative 
director 
at 
Saint 
Laurent 
from 2012 to 2016. He is often 
lauded as the brains behind the 
house’s revival; he introduced 
an epoch of heroin-chic, all-
black-everything, 
sending 
emaciated rocker boys and 
girls down catwalks season 
after season, outfitting them 
in minidresses, trim leather 
jackets 
and 
Chelsea 
boots 
emblazoned 
with 
glittering 
stars. During Slimane’s tenure, 
Saint Laurent embodied an 
unattainable 
effortlessness 
that made the fashion industry 
swoon. After his first few 
collections at the label, the 
consensus 
rang 
out: 
This 
would be known as the era of 
the tasteful ’90s resurgence, 
of club kids with legs like baby 
deer and cigarettes poking 
through plump crimson lips.
The United States political 
climate was perfectly poised 
to embrace Slimane’s Saint 
Laurent. These were the days 
of the Obama administration 
and the rise of Instagram stars 
like Emily Ratajkowski, whose 
simultaneous sex appeal and 
political activism proved to 

the American public that the 
human body could serve as 
a platform for liberation. It 
made 
perfect 
sense, 
then, 
that Slimane would choose to 
relocate the brand’s operations 
to sunny LA, where critics and 
admirers alike expected him to 
grow Saint Laurent for years to 
come.
But nothing in fashion is ever 
that simple. On Apr. 4, 2016, 
just two years after the move 
to Los Angeles, Saint Laurent 
announced that Slimane would 
be leaving the house, succeeded 
by 
former 
Versus 
Versace 
designer Anthony Vaccarello, 
who promptly began a quest 
toward 
maintaining 
the 
brand’s reputation as the go-to 
atelier for those who live fast, 
die young and have the means 

to shop designer. Meanwhile, 
the switch left Slimane in 
fashion’s 
no-man’s-land 
of 
designers 
departed, 
joined 
by the likes of Alber Elbaz, 
former creative director of 
Lanvin, and Peter Copping, the 
successor to Oscar De La Renta 
at his eponymous label.
Saint Laurent’s switcheroo 
was no doubt dramatic, but 
it was nothing compared to 
the tail end of 2016, when the 
fashion industry experienced 
what may have been its most 
seismic shift in recent history: 
Phoebe 
Philo, 
the 
illusive 
creative director of Céline, 
would be stepping down after 
nearly a decade at the Parisian 
label’s helm.
Worn and adored by everyone 
from the Kardashians to the 
women of Wall Street, Phoebe 
Philo’s Céline was smart over 
everything else, equal parts 
aesthetic and function. Her 
tenure turned the brand into a 
reigning authority on garments 
made by a real-life woman, 
for real-life women (albeit 
rich ones). The “glove shoes” 
from 
her 
spring-summer 
2015 collection balanced the 

grandeur of a chunky block 
heel with the security and ease 
of a ballet flat. Season after 
season, her slip dresses landed 
impeccably on the curves of 
every body, offering wearers a 
glimpse into a world in which 
beauty was truly effortless. She 
redefined the “it” bag with the 
inimitable Luggage tote. She 
ushered older women back into 
the fashion spotlight when she 
cast author Joan Didion, then 
80 years old, in a 2015 eyewear 
campaign.
Everything Philo rolled out 
felt intimate and relatable, 
perhaps due in part to the 
fact that, after convincing 
parent company LVMH to 
build a studio for Céline in her 
native London, she essentially 
worked from home. According 
to notorious fashion journalist 
Cathy 
Horyn, 
Philo 
was 
known for her insistence that 
“all her design choices were 
personal.” When dreaming up 
a collection, she took not only 
her own artistic vision into 
account but expressed concern 
for how her garments would 
fit into the lives of those who 
wore 
them. 
Whether 
such 
consideration was conscious is 
not the point; it happened, and 
it revolutionized the way the 
21st century woman wears her 
clothes.
“Look around this winter, on 
subways and buses — wherever 
there’s a woman in a camel 
coat, gray pants, and white 
boots — that’s Phoebe Philo 
who did that,” wrote Sarah 
Mower, Chief Critic for Vogue.
com, in an article following 
news of the departure. “Even if 
the wearers have never heard 
of Céline, it was Philo who put 
together the uniform which 
holds working women together 
today.”
Who could replace a woman 
of such stature, so acutely 
in-tune 
with 
the 
modern 
meaning of femininity?
On Jan. 21, 2018, LVMH 
officially appointed Slimane 
as artistic, creative and image 
director 
of 
Céline, 
along 
with 
announcing 
that 
the 
label would be extending its 
reach 
into 
menswear. 
The 
proclamation was met with a 
healthy mix of excitement and 
apprehension from fashion’s 
best and brightest. Why enlist 
Slimane, purveyor of bourgeois 
glamour, to follow up one 
of the greatest minimalists 
fashion has ever seen? Why 
add menswear to a brand 
known for its resonance with 
women across contexts? Writer 
Haley Mlotek said it best 
in an interview for Fashion 
Magazine: “I don’t think the 
next designer of Céline had to 
be a woman necessarily, but I 
had hoped it would be someone 
with a demonstrated interest in 
making what women wanted.”
After months of anticipation 
fueled by media buzz and a 
shiny new logo — Slimane 
dropped the accent, rebranding 
as “Celine” — it came time 
for fashion’s favorite bad boy 
to present his latest venture 
to the world. Last Friday, 
hordes of industry insiders and 
Slimane’s closest pals (read: 
Lady Gaga) gathered at the 
Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, 
eager to absorb, or perhaps to 
judge, what the reimagination

Anger becomes activism 
in ‘Rage Becomes Her’ 

BOOK REVIEW

I grew up in a world where 
women were socialized to be 
silent and polite, to not speak 
too much or too loudly. I grew 
up thinking that I too needed 
to close my legs, my lips and 
consequently my 
emotions too. I 
thought 
it 
was 
just a “me” thing, 
that I suppressed 
my emotions. My 
anxiety and anger 
were internalized 
rather 
than 
expressed. 
Clenching 
my 
teeth as I slept, 
clenching 
my 
wrists as I paced 
back 
and 
forth 
in a torrential downpour of 
thoughts. 
Everything 
was 
constrained inward and no 
worries, no frustrations, no 
emotion were let out. I was 
angry. I have always been 
angry. I just never knew what 
to do about it.
Reading Soraya Chemaly’s 
“Rage Becomes Her” was far 
more than a sign of relief — it 
was enlightening, insightful 
but mostly enraging. Does it 
not bring you to tears that “in 
the United States a person is 
sexually assaulted every two 
minutes,” a majority of which 
are women? Or that “ ... 32,000 
US women” are impregnated 
through rape each year? Or 
that fewer than three percent 
of rapists are ever prosecuted? 
Because it turns my blood to 
high heat.
This book could not have 
come out at a more pertinent 
time given today’s political 
climate. With the hearing for 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
multiple 

assault 
accusations 
this 
week, every inch of my skin 
is crawling. The hierarchy of 
superiority and privilege that 
coddles white men in power 
from facing the repercussions 
of their actions is infuriating, 
to say the least. But more than 
the inclination of Kavanaugh, 
the president and multiple 
other male senators to ridicule 
and 
doubt 
Dr. 
Christine Blasey 
Ford sheds light 
on the stomach-
wrenching 
victim-blaming 
that 
permeates 
our 
political 
culture. 
People 
often 
don’t 
want 
to 
accept 
the 
world 
and 
their place in it 
so instead they 
“up the ante on 
gaslighting, 
victim 
blaming 
... and adamantly defending 
the 
status 
quo.” 
These 
manipulative 
tactics 
often 
shame and silence victims 
of 
assault 
who 
may 
take 
years gathering the courage 
to publically speak on such 
personally disturbing topics.
Dr. Ford’s hearing echoes 
the 1991 Anita Hill case against 
Clarence Thomas, in which she 
boldly confronted an all-white, 
all-male council of senators 
and had her credibility torn to 
shreds. Anita Hill was never 
heard then, and Dr. Ford is 
definitely 
not 
being 
heard 
now. By not believing women 
and victims of assault, we are 
not only taking away their 
voice, but also suppressing 
their humanity. And this is 
something 
worth 
getting 
angry about.
If movements like #MeToo 
or #TimesUp have made men 
feel vulnerable or attacked 
by the women who decided 

it was their turn to speak the 
truth, then, in the words of 
Chemaly, “Welcome to our 
world.” I will never be sorry 
that 
Kavanaugh’s 
“family 
honor” and reputation have 
received a two-week bad report 
card when his actions have 
demolished the life, mental 
health and psyche of the 
women he assaulted. Nothing 
will ever equate to the years of 
pain and trauma these victims 
endure, or the number of “dick 
pics, cannibalistic rape porn, 
racist gore” and even death 
threats that get sent to women 
who come forward about their 
assault. Too many people are 
focused on safeguarding the 
“honor” and prosperity of men 
rather than valuing the rights 
and dignity of women.
“Rage 
Becomes 
Her” 
provides more than fume-
filled statistics — it is a self-
help manual for transforming 
rage into action that will have 
lasting political and social 
implications. 
Some 
tips 
I 
find helpful for dealing with 
personal (or political) anger 
are cultivating communities, 
developing self-awareness and 
challenging binaries, among 
others. 
No 
more 
standing 
aside, allowing power-hungry 
men to silence the voices of 
women and assault victims 
alike. 
Revise 
your 
anger 
to make it something you 
embrace, a tool that pushes you 
forward into the world with 
wisdom, passion and freedom. 
In Chemaly’s words, “Anger is 
the demand of accountability. 
It is evaluation, judgment and 
refutation. It is reflective, 
visionary and participatory. 
It’s a speech act, a social 
statement, an intention and a 
purpose.”
I am a woman, and I am 
liberated by my rage. You 
should be too.

STYLE NOTEBOOK


It is plain to see that there 

are not a lot of people rooting 
for network television’s return 
to glory. The discourse around 
network television has become 
as stale as they claim the shows 
to be: We all know it’s become 
safe and is no longer breaking 
new ground. It’s currently cool 
to hate network TV. I am not 
denying that there are things to 
hate, as evidenced by anything 
that Chuck Lorre releases and 
the perpetual green-lighting 
of more “The Goldbergs” rip-
offs, rather, I am arguing that 
in the competition to see who 
can hate network TV the most, 
we 
overlook 
gems. 
“Single 

Parents” is one of those gems.

“Single Parents” is pretty 

self-explanatory. Four single 
parents struggle to balance 
adulthood 
and 
parenthood 

while clashing with their kids’ 

new 
classroom 
coordinator, 

Will (Taran Killam, “Saturday 
Night Live”), a mushy helicopter 
dad. Will is as overbearing 
as he is positive, announcing 
to the class on the first day 
all of the new 
(and 
pointless) 

initiatives he has 
imagined. 
The 

singles 
vow 
to 

get him out of 
his shell with the 
sole 
motivation 

of 
shirking 

off 
any 
extra 

responsibilities 
that may come their way. From 
there, hilarity ensues, and the 
show takes off.

The diverse cast of “Single 

Parents” is one of the primary 
reasons 
it 
works 
so 
well. 

Without feeling forced, it does 
great work to show that there is 
no one “type” of single parent 
and also highlights the bond 
their situation has created 
for them. It makes for great 
comedy to see the interactions 

between these people who, 
if not for their kids, would 
probably never have contact. 
In what other universe would 
ultra-feminist 
mom 
Poppy 

(Kimrie 
Lewis, 
“Scandal) 

and chauvinistic 
father 
Douglas 

(Brad 
Garrett, 

“Christopher 
Robin”) ever have 
contact, let alone 
be 
comfortable 

enough 
with 

each other that 
Poppy can barge 
in on Douglas’s 

steak dinner of “pasty, old 
white guys” (Poppy’s words, 
not mine)? While the writing 
feels authentic and the jokes 
land with consistency, a great 
debt is owed to the fantastic 
cast rounded out by Leighton 
Meester (“Gossip Girl”) and 
Jake Choi (“Lethal Weapon”) 
for elevating what could have 
been a forgettable one-episode 
wonder into something worth 
watching on a weekly basis.

The show is doing what 

other network shows should 
have been doing for years. 
Rather than giving us neutered 
versions of what we expect to 
see on premium cable, it takes 
the familiar tropes that we 
have come to associate with 
network television and gives 
them a fresh twist.

“Single Parents” does an 

exemplary 
job 
of 
blending 

together 
two 
of 
the 
most 

familiar formulas in network 
television history (the young 
singles show and the family 
show) and coming out with 
something timely and realistic 
for 
viewing 
audiences 
in 

2018. “Single Parents” treats 
viewers to the best of both 
worlds: all of the wacky, fun 
dating plotlines of a “Happy 
Endings” or a “Don’t Trust 
the B in Apartment 23” while 
still being able to provide the 
warmth of a family-centric 
show like “Modern Family” or 
“Black-ish.” 
Thus, 
watching 

feels like meeting someone 
new, yet having that strange 
sensation you’ve known them 
forever. So, please, even in the 
contemporary climate of hating 
anything 
and 
everything 

network, direct those energies 
towards 
something 
more 

deserving and give “Single 
Parents” a chance.

Stand-up is to the comedy 

industry as PornHub is to the 
pornography industry: You need 
to sift through a lot of shit to get 
to the good stuff and it’s mostly 
watched 
and 
performed 
by 

straight, white men. Like porn, if 
you want to get into the industry, 
you have to learn from the best. 
And in my foolish and curious 
eyes, I got the Playboy of comedy 
internships. I would be working 
at the best comedy club in New 
York City (which, for the sake of 
this article, I will just call “The 
Club”). My internship at The 
Club was unpaid, of course, but 
the opportunity of a lifetime. The 
red-carpeted halls were filled 
with signed portraits of some 
of the biggest names in comedy, 
from Ellen DeGeneres to Dave 
Chappelle to Jimmy Fallon. I was 
in comedy heaven. My first day on 
the job, I arrived at The Club in my 
Gilda Radner T-Shirt ready to take 
on the world and start my plot for 
comedic domination. I was now 
working at The Club. I could hang 
out with famous comedians every 
night. I could live marvelously 
like Midge Maisel. I could get free 
drinks and have running bits with 
the bartender Kenny.

I snapped out of my daydream 

with a call from my boss, Randy. 
I told him I was waiting at the 
club eagerly. He kind of chuckled 
when he said, “I’m not there, I’m 
in Washington Heights, that’s 
where I work. Come here to 
Washington Heights, a full hour 
subway away from The Club.” So, 
I trekked to Washington Heights 
to what I presumed would be a 
cheap office building filled to the 
brim with comedians throwing 
jokes at each other and playing 
mini basketball with crumpled 
paper balls.

Alas, when Randy opened the 

door I discovered that his “office” 
was a closet-like room in his tiny 
apartment. His office looked more 
like a serial killer’s hideout than a 
comedy club director’s. The walls 
were covered in post-its scribbled 
with odd things like “money 
ideas” and “funny one-liners.” 
A small IKEA desk was shoved 
in the corner by the radiator, 
topped with an outdated Dell 
computer that hummed like my 
grandmother’s washing machine. 
The floor was covered with 
cardboard 
boxes 
overflowing 

with papers and stacks of books 
on everything from comedy to 
bitcoin. In a swivel chair lined 
with an orthotics insert sat Randy, 
an overweight, washed-up, failed 
comedian in black sweatpants, a 
striped polo and Costco slippers. 
He resembled what Jerry Seinfeld 
might look like if he let himself go 
or a Jewish Louis C.K. He didn’t 
look me in the eye, only motioned 
me to join him in the un-air-
conditioned “office.”

The only place to sit was a 

small foot stool next to his desk. 

I sat below him, like a shoe-
shine at a train station. In a long-
winded speech that included 
two poor Christopher Walken 
impressions, four D-list celebrity 
name drops, three uncomfortable 
Harvey Weinstein jokes and six 
digressions involving soup, Randy 
instructed me on my extensive 
intern responsibilities. I would 
craft, 
respond 
and 
forward 

emails all goddamn day. Randy 

firmly believed that the more 
emails he sent, the more likely 
people would attend shows and 
stand-up classes. Through the 
emails I sent while Randy was 
loudly meditating in his bedroom 
just three feet away, I discovered 
there were more people like me, 
more interns. There was actually 
a group of five boys gathered at a 
Marriott downtown doing work 
for Randy. They were working 
in the hotel lobby because Randy 
didn’t allow boys in his house 
for the sake of his eight-year-
old daughter. Therefore, he only 
allowed the six female interns 
to work in his office, where we 
performed all the secretarial 
duties 
expected 
of 
comedy 

interns. Meanwhile, the boys at 
the Marriott were writing and 
pitching jokes to Randy to be used 
in comedy roasts and classes. And 
they said misogyny was dead, or 
was it chivalry?

You’d think, Dear Reader, at 

this point I’d haul my ass far away 
from this sexist abuser of free 
labor. Alas, for weeks I continued 
to stick it out thinking that this is 
what comedy was. This was my 
ticket to success. This was how I 
would finally get to hug Tina Fey. 

We would get into The Club 

on Thursday nights for free if we 
brought enough people. Randy 
was always asking us to bring 
people to shows, sending us email 
after email to bring our lovers, 
friends and family with the 
promise of one day performing 
ourselves in front a crowd at The 
Club. I brought every friend I 
had in New York, of which there 
were few, in hopes of getting a 
spot on The Club stage. Every 
Thursday, I sat in the same spot 
with the other interns and Randy, 
drinking mediocre beer watching 
mediocre comics tell mediocre 
jokes. The same scrawny white 
guys, usually named Paul or John 
or Joe, got up every week making 

the same jokes about their penises 
and the women who didn’t want 
to have sex with them. They 
all mocked “kids these days” 
and how political correctness 
has made this generation weak, 
reminding the audience that 
maybe it wasn’t all that bad to 
beat your kids in the first place. 
They were racist and homophobic 
and Islamophobic and sexist and, 
naturally, not funny. I went back, 
every week, hoping maybe one 
female comedian would get up 
and remind me why I wanted to 
do this in the first place.

That female comedian was 

Gina Yashere (“The Stand Ups”). 
It was the first time I genuinely 
laughed all summer. Her routine 
was 
honest 
and 
hilarious. 

She 
shared 
everything 
from 

her mother’s anxieties to her 
struggles as a gay woman of color 
in comedy. After Gina, there was 
Taylor Tomlinson (“The Comedy 
Lineup”) whose self-deprecating 
humor and hilarious anecdotes 
about being a young female 
comedian resonated deeply with 
me and my struggles in comedy. 
Gina and Taylor and the dream 
of performing in front of a paying 
audience at a place as prestigious 
as The Club kept me going, 
reminding me why I wanted this 
internship in the first place. Still, 
as the summer droned on, Randy’s 
empty promises proved fruitless. 
And the Pauls and Johns and Joes 
kept coming back, leaving the 
Ginas and Taylors quite literally 
in the dark. It was then I decided 
to jump ship, leave Randy’s dingy-
ass apartment and never look 
back. While the internship was 
not exactly what I expected or 
hoped it would be, it taught me 
the importance of getting out of 
something that doesn’t feel right. 
Whether it’s an icky feeling in the 
pit of your stomach or just a hunch 
that something isn’t right, that 
feeling is valid and important.

I certainly learned some things 

about comedy while working at 
The Club. Firstly, straight, white 
men will always think they are 
funny, even if a silent crowd and 10 
years of failure prove otherwise. 
Secondly, stand-up comedy is a 
science. After seeing the same 
comedians experiment with the 
same material night after night, I 
noticed the ways they tailored and 
altered their performances based 
on responses from the crowd. 
Stand-up is also an art, and like 
any art, it takes time and practice 
and loads of repetition. Thirdly, 
the representation of women and 
people of color in the world of 
stand-up comedy, both on stage 
and in the crowd, is abysmal. We 
have to do better.

Still, Dear Reader, after all 

that, I’m committed to trying to 
make it in the wild, wild west of 
the comedy industry, no matter 
how many Pauls, Johns, Joes or 
Randys try to stand in my way.

DAILY COMEDY COLUMN

DOMINIC POLSINELLI / DAILY

‘Single Parents’ is the hope 
network television needs

Alt-J 
has 
commissioned 

remixes of their music frequently, 
usually by EDM producers. The 
recently released Reduxer is a full-
length reimagining of their 2017 
Relaxer by 11 teams of producers 
and rappers. The list includes 
Danny Brown, Pusha T and Rejjie 
Snow, along with several artists 
from outside the English-speaking 
world like Lomepal, Kontra K and 
PJ Sin Suela. If this sounds like 
a strange, improbable project, 
it’s because it is — the album 
showcases many talented artists 
trying their best with lackluster, 
ill-fitting material. The result is a 
contradictory mess that produces 
several decent tracks almost in 
spite of itself.

The British trio’s music has 

always been balanced between a 
quaint sensibility and an electronic 
sheen. The band’s first two albums 
pair frenetic percussion, buzzing 
synths and vocal distortion with 
cinematic strings and simple, 
folkish melodies. Their lyrics are 
elliptical 
and 
reference-heavy, 

revolving around sex, death and 
the 
English 
countryside. 
It’s 

difficult to say if this assemblage 
adds up to a coherent statement — 
I wouldn’t be the first to suggest 
that Alt-J embodies a certain 
kind of mannerism that values 
novelty over coherence, but the 
staging of the uneasy stylistic 
tensions is, at its best, compelling. 
Relaxer is a bit more of a muddled 
statement than the first two 
albums — not only does the chasm 
widen between the band’s “loud” 
and “quiet” personas, but the 
acoustic and analog sound of the 
first two albums is replaced by 
drum machines and seething 
synthesizers. Even the bassoon 
solo in “Last Year” and the huge 
orchestral swells in “Pleader” 
come across as digital beings, 
surreally 
summoned 
in 
a 

barren landscape.

Though “Deadcrush” and 

“3WW” begin to resemble hip hop, 
Reduxer is a decidedly new, and 
improbable, direction for the band. 
Hip hop is not the ideal format 
for an Alt-J remix. Alt-J makes 
complicated, 
slowly-developing 

instrumentals, whereas hip hop is 
a performer-centric genre where 
instrumentals are constructed out 
of a small handful of contrasting 
phrases. 
Hip-hop 
producers 

sample music wildly alien to their 
milieu all the time, but the issue 
with the “official” remix as a form 
is that remixes need to do justice 

to the original song. They retain 
the original title, and there’s a 
certain pressure on it to follow the 
original’s content. The content of 
Relaxer resists incorporation into 
rap music, even as the artists are 
pressured to do a version of the 
original songs.

Reduxer is weighed down by its 

own format. The commissioned 
artists seem at a loss as to what 
to do with what they have been 
given. There are moments of all-
out incoherence, such as in the 
remix of “Hit Me Like That Snare” 
by Jimi Charles Moody. The blues-
rock vocalist/producer makes a 
heroic attempt to rescue the song 
from itself (“Leather slings fall 
like oxygen masks / We’re going 
down, fuck my life in half”). The 
juxtaposition between Moody’s 
soulful R&B vocals and the 
ludicrous original is jarring.

More often, though, the weaker 

remixes are just boring rehashes 
of the original, with little added 

besides a verse or two from the 
rapper. The Lomepal version of 
“3WW” takes the second half of the 
song and barely alters it. His voice 
and flow are pleasant, but it doesn’t 
really feel like he really put a stamp 
on it. The Kontra K version of “In 
Cold Blood” does much the same 
thing. GoldLink and Terrance 
Martin’s remix of “Last Year” only 
barely escapes this mode through 
a deft re-contextualization of 
Marika Hackman’s vocals, but 
it flatlines with Joe Newman’s 
aimless verse, in which he counts 
to 10 in Japanese and monotones 
about leaving porridge on the boil.

However, there are moments of 

successful translation. Hex, Paigey 
Cakey and ADP turn “Adeline” 
into glazed-over codeine trap. The 
version of “Deadcrush” by Danny 
Brown and The Alchemist takes 
the original into a nightmarish 
clown world. Twin Shadow and 
Pusha T’s version of “In Cold 
Blood” strips the song for parts 
and quantizes them to a gliding 
trap beat. The most successful of 
the collection is PJ Sin Suela and 
Trooko’s version of “Pleader.” I 
didn’t think the lines “To behold 
such warmth / Call to arms these 
harmonies” could sound sinister, 
but they absolutely do here. It’s a 
remix that recalls the older term 
“flip” — this is a complete, and 
brilliant reversal, of the original.

A remix is not an homage, and 

the album loses a lot of potential 
by treating the form so narrowly. 
There are moments of brilliance, 
but they mostly arise from the 
artists going entirely counter to 
the material. Overall, the album 
feels like a pointless exercise in 
Procrustean accommodation — 
one is left with the impression 
that their talents are best applied 
elsewhere.

ALBUM REVIEW


I travel back home to Hong 
Kong every summer to visit my 
family and it always feels uneasy 
leaving my dad and his family 
when summer ends. However, 
it feels a little more uneasy and 
heavier this year as I walk into 
the security gates to leave my 
dad. As I currently write this 
piece on my 20-hour flight back 
to Michigan, I’m reflecting on 
my identity as a documented East 
Asian immigrant, retracing all 
of the sentiments on my journey 
that led to today – seeing my dad 
alone in Hong Kong as he works 
to support our family in the 
United States.
I grew up in a humble middle-
class family in Hong Kong. My 
mom’s side of my family gradually 
moved to the U.S. through family-
based documented immigration 
during the 1990s and 2000s 
to 
start 
Chinese 
restaurant 
businesses for a living. Naturally, 
my mom wanted to give me a 
chance to have better education 
and opportunity in the U.S. as 
well. We became permanent 
citizens (green card holders) 
in 2003, but we did not move to 
the U.S. for a long time after we 
received our green card, because 
we were not emotionally ready to 
go through such a drastic change.
My mom eventually moved 
to the U.S. by herself in April 
2011, getting everything settled 
for me to come to the U.S. half a 
month later. Unfortunately, her 
green card was confiscated by 
the 
immigration 
department. 
Immigration 
officers 
interrogated my mom for seven 
hours in a monitored room at the 
Detroit Metropolitan Airport. 
They said she had a “lack of desire 
to settle in the U.S.” because she 
didn’t settle in the U.S. for all 
these years after she received her 
green card. She now holds the 
status of a “temporary resident,” 
and she had to hire an attorney 
to fight for the slim chance of 
getting her green card back.
Ever since I can remember, 
it has been an ongoing and 
indefinite fight for her residential 
status. She has had five court 
hearings already and the court 
decision 
has 
always 
been 
deferred. Long story short, she 
might exhaust all her effort and 
money to lose her U.S. resident 
status at the end, and none of 
us know how much longer this 
fight will continue. She could’ve 
just left me in the U.S. and 
reunited with my dad in Hong 
Kong the day her green card was 
confiscated, but she never gave 
up and still chose to take the risk 
to care for me. I would ask my 

mom why she insisted on fighting 
a battle that leads to nowhere 
and she would tell me, “The 
hardships along our immigration 
journey mean nothing, because 
we believe it will be worth it at 
the end for you and your brother. 
It is always worth it to help you 
along the way to pursue better 
opportunities. Don’t worry too 
much.” For that, I am beyond 
grateful for my parents.
My 
mom 
wanted to make 
fair for both me 
and my brother. 
She still wanted 
to 
give 
my 
younger brother a 
chance for better 
opportunities 
in 
the U.S. like I had. 
So, she applied 
for my brother to 
go to a Christian 
school 
as 
an 
international 
student this year, 
paying thousands 
of dollars to give 
him 
a 
better 
education. Living with my dad 
for his whole life, my brother 
finally left Hong Kong to the 
diaspora, because my dad had to 
continue his job in Hong Kong 
to sustain our family financially 
overseas.
When I had to come back to the 
U.S. for the new school year, my 
dad and I walked to the security 
gates in silence. I could feel his 
heavy feelings of taking on the 
responsibilities of supporting our 
entire family, but he put on his 
calm demeanor and his fatherly 
figure on the outside as usual. 
He smiled and said, “Son, don’t 
stress yourself too much when 
you go back.” My heart aches 
to see my dad holding back his 
vulnerability when we depart at 
the airport. Since I came back 
to the U.S., my parents have 

constantly been in my thoughts 
because of all the changes our 
family is going through.
I don’t usually share much of 
my journey with others, because 
it was such a complicated, 
exhausting 
and 
expensive 
journey to talk about. Also, I know 
I have so much to be grateful for 
aside from the hardships along 
my journey. People are always 
in shock and empathize with the 
struggle 
of 
my 
family’s diasporic 
experiences when 
I tell them about 
it. But through 
my 
experiences, 
I recognize my 
privileges of being 
a 
documented 
East 
Asian 
immigrant, and I 
learned how much 
harder it must’ve 
been 
for 
other 
undocumented 
immigrants 
just 
to 
find 
better 
opportunities or 
live a better life 
in U.S. When I had to see my dad 
left alone in Hong Kong just to 
provide for our family overseas, 
it certainly made me sad and my 
heart aches, but it also reminds 
me of the blessings of my family 
has, especially when reminded 
some families of undocumented 
immigrants 
are 
forcefully 
torn apart and sometimes lose 
contact with each other. I am 
fortunate enough to still have 
a family. I can’t even start to 
imagine how much more uneasy 
undocumented immigrants must 
feel, considering the way more 
complicated process and the 
unimaginable traumas.
Sometimes, 
privileged 
documented immigrants, like 
some of my relatives, don’t see 
the way I see immigration issues. 
They are so focused on their 

troubles on the diaspora journey 
that 
they 
fail 
to 
recognize 
the bigger picture of others’ 
struggles. Yes, we might not be 
the crazy rich Asian “FOBs” 
rocking Moschino and Supreme 
daily. Quite frankly, my mom’s 
family started from nothing 
and can barely afford living in 
middle-class suburbs in the U.S. 
even now. There were way more 
roadblocks along the way that 
I left out in this piece. We have 
our struggles. But it doesn’t 
make it valid for documented 
immigrants to say it is unfair just 
because we had to go through 
all the time-consuming legal 
processes and troubles while 
undocumented 
immigrants 
had not. White supremacy has 
given you permission to believe 
undocumented 
immigrants 
are dangerous or a burden to 
society, when in fact they are 
human, just like us. Imagine your 
family being forcefully separated 
and potentially never seeing 
them again. Imagine your only 
options are either being dead 
in warzones or risking lives to 
just escape and survive in the 
Global North. Imagine all the 
traumas, hardships, bigotry, they 
have to put up with in the Global 
North. In fact, they deserve an 
opportunity in the U.S. more than 
we do because of the conditions 
they face in their home countries.
Retrace our journeys. At the 
end of the day, undocumented 
immigrants are just striving to 
live a better life in diaspora just 
like us documented immigrants. 
While they have fewer resources 
than we do, we should recognize 
our privileges, support policies 
like 
Deferred 
Action 
for 
Childhood Arrivals and abolish 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement. We must stand in 
solidarity with undocumented 
immigrants.

Sister, sister: On finding 
real, shared experiences

I’ve obsessed over “Sister, 
Sister,” a TV show about twins 
separated at birth and reunited, 
since I first stumbled upon it in 
elementary school. Back then, I 
liked it because it was funny and 
entertaining. But now, as I still 
watch it 19 years after its final 
episode aired, I’m realizing how 
much the show really meant to 
me.
For a long time, I wanted a 
relationship like the twins Tia 
and Tamera had on the show. 
I saw myself in 
Tia. 
Like 
her, 
I’m a plan ahead, 
always prepared, 
honor roll, type-A 
kind of student. 
I 
could 
relate 
so 
strongly 
to 
her. 
At 
times, 
moments on the 
show 
became 
my reality. Like 
Tia, I worked so 
hard all throughout high school 
and was sure I’d get into the best 
universities in the country. I felt 
her disappointment when she 
received her rejection letter from 
Harvard University, and just 
like in the show, my mom and I 
jumped for joy when I got into the 
University of Michigan.
Back then, I didn’t realize how 
big of a role model Tia was for 
me. I didn’t think too much about 
how great it felt to watch a show 
in which the main characters 
looked like me. I did not know 
how much I would come to 
appreciate the show’s honest, 
real representation of some of 
the experiences I would later 
face growing up as a Black girl in 
America.
But at its core, “Sister, Sister” 
is about the unbreakable bond, 
love and friendship between two 
sisters. When I told my friends 
how badly I wanted a twin sister, 
they laughed at the impossibility 
and tried to comfort me with 
stories of how annoying their 
sisters were. With one older 

brother, I can still relate to 
having a sibling, but the six years 
that separate us make it difficult 
to have any shared experiences.
It wasn’t until recently that I 
realized what it really was about 
Tia and Tamera’s relationship 
that I longed for all this time. 
Tia and Tamera can relate to 
each other in a way that very 
few people can. They share lived 
experiences because of their age, 
similar physical appearances and 
environment. They understand 
each other in a special way only 
identical twins, and maybe other 
really close relatives or friends, 
can.
Now I realize 
all that time I 
spent 
watching 
shows like “Sister, 
Sister” and “The 
Bold 
Type,” 
I 
was looking for 
someone to whom 
I could relate. I’ve 
finally found that 
person for me, 
and no, I didn’t 
discover a long-lost twin or clone 
myself. Instead, I am beyond 
lucky to have made a friend 
who shares a background so 
similar to my own. I find myself 
eager to share my frustrations 
with her because I know she’ll 
understand. I don’t have to give 
her background information on 
where I stand because she’s lived 
so much of it. Finally, I can say, 
“You know” and she actually 
knows!
What a relief it is to have 
someone who gets it. To have 
someone to talk to about the 
struggle of grasping my identity 
as Nigerian and Black. To have 
someone who can relate to my 
love of fashion and my faith. To 
have someone who understands 
my hesitation and frustration 
with make-up. And possibly most 
importantly, to have someone 
who will never get sick of 
re-watching Black Panther with 
me.
To Efe, the sister I always 
wanted and friend I am forever 
grateful to have.

When so much of my news 
is disseminated into 20-word 
summaries with a link to an 
article as I scroll through my 
social media, it is really easy to 
remain distanced from the impact 
of current events. In fact, on Sept. 
6, 2018, it took at least four posts 
about the same thing for me to 
realize what monumental change 
had just occurred — the Indian 
Supreme Court declared Section 
377 of the Indian Penal Code to 
be unconstitutional. In the sea 
of comments, there seemed to 
be this notion that India was 
finally modernizing like Western 
countries, but that was not the 
truth — India was and is still in 
the process of decolonization. It’s 
not moving forward, rather, it’s 
moving away from white colonial 
ideals.
As an Indian American born in 
the United States, my experience 
with LGBTQ issues at a personal 
and policy level has been decidedly 
complex. I grew up in California 

in a time when Proposition 22 in 
2000 and Proposition 8 in 2008 
caused huge controversy over 
same-sex marriage and LGBTQ 
rights. It wasn’t really an issue 
discussed at home — my parents 
grew up in India, where gay sex 
was criminalized. It was illegal 
to be gay. My experiences in 
school, especially through my 
involvement in social justice 
groups, made it clear that this 
way of thinking was unfair. And 
though my parents might have 
been conservative, even my father 
would have argued that due to the 
civil rights attributed to marriage, 
everyone had a right to marry 
whom they wished. On the other 
hand, I also knew my parents 
would be deeply uncomfortable if 
I came out as queer.
The 
biggest 
complexity, 
however, came from my religion. 
My family practiced Hinduism. 
I didn’t practice it religiously, 
but Hinduism was about more 
than rituals and festivals. It was 
about philosophy and ethics. 
The religious text I was most 
familiar with (because there 
are several in Hinduism), is the 

Bhagavad Gita — the speech Lord 
Krishna gave to Arjuna when his 
commitment to justice wavered 
in the face of having to fight 
his family. And not once in the 
entire text, did it mention that 
“you shall not lie with a male as 
with a woman.” In fact, Hindu 
mythology didn’t simply ignore 
queerness, the myths included it. 
There were stories of Vishnu, one 
of the primary deities, taking on a 
female appearance and engaging 
in 
relationships 
with 
male 
deities who knew his original 
form. When my culture was 
filled with stories that were not 
heteronormative, it was difficult 
to reconcile what I read with 
what I saw being practiced.
It wouldn’t be until college that 
I’d learn what Section 377 was 
and from where it came. Before 
the British colonized India, there 
was a vibrant queer history. It 
wasn’t the norm, but it wasn’t 
considered against nature either. 
To see my mother country stuck 
in the white supremacist ideals of 
a bygone age was frustrating and 
painful. It was shameful to know 
that a place I considered vital to 

my heritage was also considered 
so backward. I wanted India to be 
better, and yet I could understand 
that as an oppressed people, how 
difficult it was to unlearn these 
bigoted views.
When I saw people celebrating 
the repeal of Section 377 as a move 
toward Western ideology, I was 
angered. This didn’t acknowledge 
that Section 377 wasn’t an Indian 
ideology but a Western one 
 
in the first place. Yes, we live 
in the 21st century and LGBTQ 
rights should be a given and not a 
constant struggle, but India only 
gained independence 70 years 
ago.
It takes time to undo societal 
norms. There’s certainly more 
to be done for LGBTQ rights 
women’s rights and lower caste 
rights in India. But with the new 
verdict, India has taken one more 
step towards embracing its roots 
and culture.
So, in the end, I did hit the 
love button on that Buzzfeed 
India post and every other time 
it came up in my newsfeed. And 
each time I clicked it, I felt pretty 
damn proud to be brown.

Moving away, not forward: LGBTQ rights in India

MiC Columnist

“It’s 25 songs?”
My initial reaction to the 
track listing of Scorpion by 
Drake had nothing to do with 
interesting 
track 
titles 
like 
“Ratchet Happy Birthday” or 
“Can’t Take A Joke” — it was 
about how obnoxiously long the 
Toronto artist’s newest project 
was going to be.
Twenty-five tracks, split up 
into an A side and B side. A year 
after we had gotten a 22-song 
“playlist” in More Life and two 
years after the release of the 
20-song Views, Drake’s albums 
have only been 
getting 
longer, 
and in an age 
where streaming 
giants 
like 
Spotify, 
Apple 
Music and Tidal 
have dominated 
the 
music 
consumption and 
listening 
space, 
it makes senses. 
More songs on an 
album means more streams or 
plays which means more money 
for the artist. Sure, the overall 
quality of the albums are bound 
to go down, but this is the best 
strategy in terms of releasing 
music nowadays, right?
Kanye West would have to 
disagree. 
When most of the music 
industry has zigged and ditched 
the standard 13-song album 
model for longer and longer 
projects, Yeezy and the rest 
of G.O.O.D. Music zagged and 
dropped a series of 7 to 8 song 
projects 
this 
past 
summer. 
Highlighted 
by 
Pusha 
T’s 
DAYTONA, Kanye’s self-titled 
ye, and the inaugural joint 
album effort of Kanye and Kid 
Cudi with KIDS SEE GHOSTS, 
G.O.O.D Music opted for shorter 

LPs, with the runtime of most 
of the albums falling under or 
about 25 minutes.
While this seems to be more 
of an artistic decision than one 
influenced by a bottom line 
(“Man, if we can’t kill you in 
seven songs, we don’t really 
need to be doing the music,” 
was Pusha T’s response about 
G.O.O.D. 
Music’s 
strategy), 
it’s worth considering if there 
are some monetary benefits 
to Kanye and crew’s sudden 
change 
in 
direction. 
With 
an album length that was so 
easily digestible, I listened to 
ye start-to-finish seven or eight 
times within the first 24 hours 
of its release — seven tracks 
multiplied 
by 
seven 
start-to-
finish 
listens 
comes out to 49 
total 
streams, 
not including the 
extra 
streams 
I gave to songs 
like 
“Ghost 
Town” and “No 
Mistakes.”
Conversely, 
Scorpion was an 
absolute struggle to get through 
— just as More Life had been 
for me the year before. Once I 
had completed the marathon 
and listened to the entirety of 
the 25-song behemoth, I had 
no intention of going back for 
a second start-to-finish play of 
the Drake project. It was too 
much to listen to. It got boring. 
It 
lost 
my 
attention 
more 
than once. It wasn’t engaging. 
Twenty-five tracks multiplied 
by one start-to-finish listen 
comes out to 25 total streams, 
not including my extra streams 
of songs like “Sandra’s Rose” 
and “Emotionless.”
I streamed the seven-song 
album almost twice as much as 
I did the 25-song album. Has 
Kanye stumbled onto something 
here? Maybe. Just maybe.

“I streamed the 
seven-song album 
almost twice as 
much as I did the 
25-song album” 

“I don’t usually 
share much of 
my journey with 
other, because 
it was such a 
complicated ... 
journey to talk 
about”

“What a relief it is 
to have someone 
who gets it”

Team cohesion leads Michigan to 13th at Nuttycombe Invitational

There were five minutes 

before 
the 
gun 
sounded 

when 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

cross country team huddled 
together. 
Wolverine 
coach 

Kevin Sullivan was doing his 
part to get the team mentally 
ready for the task at hand — to 
prove the pre-meet rank of No. 
19 wrong.

Michigan gathered together 

like it always does before a 
race to preach the game plan 
and remain calm ahead of the 
excitement of the race. To the 
casual observer, it may seem to 
be an odd sight. Cross country 
is not typically considered 
a team sport, but for the 
Wolverines, 
teamwork 
and 

pack running are the name of 
the game.

This approach was boldly 

apparent at the Nuttycombe 
Invitational in Madison, Wis., 
where all five of the runners 
who 
scored 
for 
the 
meet 

finished within 22.5 seconds of 
one another. In fact, the spread 
was so tight for Michigan 
that the times between the 
Wolverines’ first and seventh 
runners was closer than all but 
two teams’ first through fifth 
competitors.

“We 
talked 
about 
it 

beforehand,” 
said 
redshirt 

sophomore 
Jacob Lee. “We 
wanted to try to 
find each other 
because, 
you 

know, when the 
gun goes off, 
we kinda get 
dispersed, 
we 

want to try to 
find each other, 
try 
to 
pump 

each 
other 

up, work together, constantly 
move up throughout the pack, 
and that’s what we did really 
well, and that’s what we try to 

do in practice too. We try to 
work as a unit.”

Leading 
that 
unit 
for 

Michigan 
were 
Lee 
and 

sophomore 
Jack Aho, who 
finished 58th and 
61st at the race, 
respectively. Lee 
and Aho first saw 
the course last 
year when they 
finished 
second 

and third at the 
Invitational’s 
B 

race.

Getting as much exposure 

to the course as possible is 
paramount for the Wolverines. 

The 
Thomas 
Zimmer 

Championship 
Course 
will 

serve as the sight of this 
year’s 
Cross 

Country National 
Championships, 
and 
Michigan 

will be back in 
just 
two 
short 

weeks 
for 
the 

Pre-National 
Invitational.

“That’s 
one 

of 
the 
reasons 

we wanted to be 
at Wisconsin at 
some point before the national 
championship,” Lee said. “So 
we get a sense of how the course 
runs, what the layout’s like, and 

certainly being in a field like we 
did this weekend, we got a feel 
of a national championship type 

field 
before 

we even get to 
the 
national 

championships.”

However, due 

to 
the 
team’s 

youth, it might 
be 
a 
difficult 

road ahead en 
route to a final 
date 
with 
the 

Zimmer Course 
in just a couple 

months. After losing star power 
with the departures of Ben 
Flanagan, 
Connor 
Mora 
and 

others, this young Michigan team 

has had to put in extra effort in 
order to maintain the standard of 
success.

So 
far, 
the 

team has been 
able to do just 
that with late-
race surges and 
patience. 
After 

the 
first 
two 

kilometers 
of 

the 
race, 
the 

Wolverines 
started 
things 

conservatively 
and were sitting 
in 25th place. After quickly 
finding their teammates in 
the pack, the team slowly 
began to creep toward its 13th 

place finish. Highlighting the 
patience and perseverance of 
the team’s performance was 
redshirt junior Ben Hill, who 
jumped up twenty spots in the 
last two kilometers to finish 
89th.

“A 
lot 
of 
it’s 
just 

understanding 
what 
the 

effort is, and the field that 
we were in with the caliber of 
competition and the quality 
of the other teams that are 
in there,” Sullivan said, “The 
tendency can be to run too 
hard too early, and our guys 
did a very good job managing 
their efforts early in the race 
and that allowed them to 
move through the field.

“So we’re in 25th place 2k 

in the race but move all the 
way to 13th by the end, it 
means we’re doing good job 
of running within ourselves 
early so that we can make 
good hard pushes over the 
last half of the race.”

For this team, the six spots 

of improvement is just the 
beginning of what will be a 
long season of success, and 
it all starts with teamwork. 
According to Lee, exceeding 
expectations 
will 
be 
par 

for the course for Michigan 
because of its camaraderie.

“I’d say that all around 

we have a great culture,” 
Lee said. “I’d say that we’re 

young, 
but 

we’re fighters, 
we’re grinders, 
we’re ready to 
put in the work, 
ready 
to 
do 

what needs to 
be done. I think 
people 
can 

overlook us in 
the Big Ten just 
because we are 
so young and 

because we lost a lot of great 
talent, but if they did that, 
that would be a big mistake 
on their part.”

“I’d say that 
all around, we 
have a great 

culture.”

“The tendency 
can be to run 
too hard too 

early...”

“A lot of it’s just 
understanding 
what the effort 

is...”

All five of the Wolverines’ scored runners finished within 22.5 seconds of one another for a 13th-place finish in Wisconsin.

Winovich believes best is yet to come in historic run

After 
Saturday’s 
20-17 

comeback 
win 
over 

Northwestern 
— 
a 
game 

in 
which 
fifth-year 
senior 

defensive end Chase Winovich 
registered nine tackles, three 
tackles-for-loss and a sack, and 
more broadly, was relentless — 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said it was one of the best 
games of Winovich’s career.

“I think Chase had one of his 

better ballgames,” Harbaugh 
said after the game. “Just the 
way he was flying around and 
hustling all night. I mean, play 
after play after play after play.”

Winovich 
played 

“60-something” snaps by his 
estimation and received as 
many double-teams as he can 
recall in a game. It didn’t seem 
to matter much.

By any metric or alternative 

mode of judgment, Winovich 
is having the best season of his 
career. Here are just a couple 
statistics to drive that point 
home:

• 
He currently leads the 

nation with 10.5 tackles-for-
loss. If he sustains this pace, 
he’ll finish with 27 tackles-
for-loss on the season, just 
1.5 short of the school record 
set by Shawn 
Crable in 2007. 
That would also 
leave him just 
four shy of the 
career 
school 

record 
set 
by 

Mark 
Messner 

from 1985-1988.

• 
He’s 

on 
pace 
for 

an 
eight-sack 

season for the 
second consecutive year. He 
would be the first to notch that 
feat since Brandon Graham in 
2007-2008. Winovich is just 
a few years removed from 
playing tight end.

Some might take a few days to 

relish in those comments from 
Harbaugh, or more generally 
take a step back at what’s on 
pace to be a historical season 
and a historical career. That’s 
just not Chase Winovich.

“I’m 
definitely 
playing 

better, and some of my best 
football,” 
Winovich 
said 

Tuesday evening. “I still feel 
like I haven’t played my best 
football.”

If his game at Northwestern 

wasn’t what his best looks like, 
what does?

“The 
way 

I see it in my 
head, if I had 
to 
look 
at 
it 

from a numbers 
standpoint, 
I 
would 
look 

at it and say 
‘multiple sacks,’ 
just 
from 
a 

grading-out 
perspective 
— from a pass-

rush point of view — I’d say 
simply unblockable,” Winovich 
said. “In my head, that’s what 
I’m chasing. In my head it 
could be better.

“I want to be a shark in a 

game full of guppies.”

His focus stays squarely 

on 
the 
present. 
He’s 
not 

shy about much, including 
throwing 
out 
phrases 
like 

“Big 
Ten 
Championship” 

and “the playoffs” in routine 

answers. Winovich isn’t like 
most athletes, in a way that’s 
refreshingly human. He came 
back to school for those goals. 
He came back to be a dominant 
college football player. He 
came back partially because 
Shea Patterson came in.

But he also came back to 

improve 
his 

NFL 
draft 

stock and he 
doesn’t 
hide 

that either. 

“It’s 
always 

on my mind,” 
Winovich said 
of 
his 
draft 

stock. “It’s just 
one 
of 
those 

things, in the 
pecking 
order 

of things to do, it’s somewhere 
in the middle.”

Having already provided an 

appropriate level of candor, a 
normal athlete might stop his 
answer there. Chase Winovich, 
instead, needs to make an 
archery analogy to emphasize 
his point.

“If you’re an archer and 

you’re trying to hit the target 
and you’re thinking about the 
gold prize,” he hypothesizes, 

“all of a sudden you’re thinking 
about the gold prize and not 
the target you’re trying to hit.”

Both 
CBSSports.com 
and 

Bleacher Report released new 
NFL 
mock 
drafts 
Monday 

night. Winovich didn’t make 
the first round of either.

“The trajectory and what 

I’ve heard and 
gathered 
from 

people 
is 
that 

the 
trajectory 

is 
ascending 

pretty quickly,” 
Winovich 
said. 

“I’m just trying 
to do my part 
to make sure it 
stays that way.”

The 
“status 

quo” 
doesn’t 

seem to be in Winovich’s 
vocabulary 
these 
days, 
or 

ever. He’d rather hone in on 
his inner shark, terrorizing 
everything in his path, leaving 
no doubt.

“I’m setting myself up for 

that game that’s like ‘This is 
Chase Winovich.’ I don’t think 
I’ve played that game yet,” he 
said.

Then a warning.
“I think it’s coming.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior defensive end Chase Winovich leads the nation in tackles-for-loss with 10.5 through five games.

Defense focus shifts 
toward covering slants 

The Michigan football team’s 

defense had trouble in the first 
quarter of Saturday’s win over 
Northwestern.

It started right away, as the 

Wildcats (1-3 overall, 1-1 Big Ten) 
drove down the field and scored on 
their first three drives, leaping out 
to a 17-0 lead.

That result was a bit surprising, 

considering 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense is as strong as it is — the No. 
1 total defense through five games 
this season.

But 
Northwestern 
still 

accumulated 145 yards on its first 
three touchdowns, cutting its 
way through Michigan’s vaunted 
defense, all until the Wolverines 
(4-1, 2-0) locked down for the 
rest of the game, aiding in a 20-17 
comeback victory.

“I can’t really put my finger on it,” 

said junior cornerback David Long. 
“Credit to them, they came out 
hungry. We just made adjustments 
and got back in there and competed 
and fought our tails off to get back 
into the game and ultimately win 
it.”

It 
was 
the 
second 
time 

Michigan’s defense has struggled in 
the first quarter of a road game this 
season. In its season-opening loss to 
Notre Dame, the Fighting Irish got 
nearly all their production in the 
beginning of the game.

The difference is that Notre 

Dame got its production with deep 
bombs and a running quarterback.

The Wildcats, on the other 

hand, used short, quick passing 
plays to pick their way through the 
Wolverines’ defense.

On Northwestern’s first drive, it 

was a 36-yard screen pass that set it 
up for a touchdown. For the rest of 
the game, the Wildcats used slant 
patterns effectively to move the 
ball.

It continued a trend for Michigan. 

Against Western Michigan and 
SMU, though the final defensive 
stats were still good, the Wolverines 
had trouble covering the slant route. 
Specifically, Michigan’s safeties 
didn’t cover slot receivers very well.

“I mean, you know, it’s a quick 

route,” said sophomore safety Brad 
Hawkins. “Having a quick route 
and playing a little off, it’s kind of 
difficult, I guess. But we fixed it, you 
know, so we’ve got a lot of things — 
schemes and stuff coming in. So it’s 
gonna be all right.”

In the second half, though, the 

Wolverines made an adjustment 
and stopped the slant route better. 
That was part of the reason for 
Northwestern’s worse offensive 
performance, as it had just 56 yards 
in the final 30 minutes.

“Same as anything else, just lock 

in,” Long said. “Lock in and just get 
our feet under ourselves and just 
focus. Take the coaching, make the 
adjustments and go in there and do 
what we know how to do.”

Added Hawkins: “We kind of, 

like, tightened down a little bit. Try 
to hug them a little more. You know, 
that’s a quick route, so you’ve gotta 
be there fast on it.”

Michigan has heard the critics. 

Whether it is about giving up 17 
points to the Wildcats in their first 
three drives or the penalties that 
have plagued the Wolverines, they 
have heard frustrations.

This week, Long responded to 

the haters, tweeting, “If you’ve 
never played man to man, please 
refrain from making comments 
about secondary play. Second, if you 
can’t check me, please refrain from 
giving your hot take as well.”

In the end, Michigan still has 

the No. 1 total defense in the 
nation. Surely that fact makes the 
adjustments to slants or penalties or 
whatever else much more palatable. 
But the Wolverines still recognize 
there are plenty of facets in which 
they can improve.

“Haters are gonna be out there,” 

said fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich. “It just is what it 
is. It’s the nature of the game. We’re 
playing crème de la crème football, 
in terms of this is big boy football. 
And with that, you’re gonna have 
a lot of expectations, and the 
expectations for the season are 
high. So, people are gonna say what 
they want, but at the end of the day, 
yeah, we’re gonna go out there and 
play.”

Remote Telemetry and 

Graham Crackers:

U-M nurses describe cuts to patient care


F

ile away those fun 
facts. Time to forget 
your 
“two 
truths 

and 
a 
lie.” 
And 

cherish the fact you won’t have 
to participate in another team 
building exercise involving a 
hula hoop. We have officially 
survived peak icebreaker period. 
Breathe. 

September is over. The month 

of new beginnings is behind 
us. The flower calendar on my 
grandmother’s 
refrigerator 

has flipped to October. Those 
awkward first days of classes 
and inaugural club meetings 
have morphed into hopefully 
a more authentic dynamic of 
human 
personalities. 
Or, 
if 

things are still awkward among 
the 20 people in your discussion 
section, you can at least take 
solace in the “31 Nights of 
Halloween” on Freeform.

As 
someone 
whose 
first 

impressions rarely parlay into 
an 
effortlessly 
charismatic 

“knock your socks” off kind of 
introduction, the icebreaker is 
a walk on thin ice. If I could, I 
would prefer to stick to the facts 
you could probably find on Facebook. Name. 
Hometown. Year. Major. There you have it 
folks. That’s all you need to know about me. 
Anything more than this will likely result 
in an answer that I will promptly spend the 
next 48 hours regretting. Do we really need 
to continue with that question about my 
best Halloween costume? 

That is the trouble with icebreakers. To 

excel at them, it is essential that you have 
a curated list of anecdotes encoded in your 
brain. A quippy story about yourself that 
your publicist would tell you to share if you 
were a scheduled as a guest on Stephen 
Colbert’s TV show. Or does the publicist 
make up the story for you? In that case, I 
think I need a publicist.

The sort of answer that is universal 

enough to be relatable, yet personal 
enough to be unique. Your response should 
garner a laugh, but not make people feel 
uncomfortable. And of course, you should 
never look like you are trying too hard, but 
you also can’t give a cop-out answer. People 
want to you to “be yourself.” To sum up how 
cool you are in a sentence. It is a tall order. 
Essentially, you are expected to be like 
Ferris Bueller when all I can usually muster 
is something closer to Bridget Jones.

The formulaic nature of icebreakers 

typically means forming a circle to foster 
a safe, welcoming space reminiscent of a 
second-grade classroom. Everyone sits 
waiting for the person who had this great 
idea to pose a question they likely found 
via a Google search for “good icebreaker 
questions” 30 seconds prior. Then the 

moment of truth — what question will you 
have to sift through your brain to find an 
answer to?

“What’s your favorite movie?” Okay, this 

is not too bad. Not as easy as your favorite 
place to travel, but still a softball question. 
I begin to flip through the movies I have 
watched to find an acceptable answer. I 
find myself only half-paying attention to 
the person droning on about “Moonrise 
Kingdom,” buying me a few more precious 
seconds to think. As my turn creeps closer 
and closer, the panic sets in. I struggle to 
even remember the last movie I watched, 
let alone my favorite. The only movies that 
come to mind are “Mamma Mia” and “Gone 
with the Wind.” Great. I will either sound 
like a lover of cheesy British musicals or a 
cliché film buff. I decide to place my faith 

in Meryl Streep. Just before it is 
my turn to speak, the person next 
to me echoes “Mamma Mia.” My 
subpar answer I had spent the 
last five minutes agonizing over 
is now taken and I am back at the 
beginning of not knowing what to 
say. Oh, the joy of icebreakers. 

Icebreakers have become the 

creed of how we get to know each 
other. Their relatively simple 
nature is the reason they have 
become a mainstay of meetings 
and introductions. However, I am 
surely not the only one who dreads 
these 
awkward 
engagements. 

They are unnatural. Full of pauses 
and silence. And often include 
glaringly obvious reactions from 
the group.

That said, I am absolutely 

guilty of the judgment that 
ensues when someone offers an 
icebreaker response that seems 
unnatural or forced. It can be 
strange when the first thing 
you learn about a person is their 
favorite karaoke song or best gift 
they have ever received. What are 
we really supposed to glean from 
these responses? Some would 
argue that icebreakers offer a 

way for people to find a connection in their 
mutual similarities. However, considering 
some of my own friendships with people 
whose tastes are completely different than 
my own, I question this argument.

Learning the faces and names of the 

people you meet in September is important. 
But, I don’t think we should hold people to 
their icebreaker responses. In all honesty, 
most of my responses make me cringe 
for hours afterward. I agonize over why 
I couldn’t think of a more interesting or 
genuine answer and hope no one remembers 
what I said. Introducing yourself shouldn’t 
require a list of favorite things that you 
can sing on cue like Maria von Trapp. 
However, that might be a good idea for next 
September.

Nurses describe cuts to patient care at Michigan Medicine

M

egan Duncan, a cardi-
ology nurse at the Uni-
versity of Michigan 

Hospital, began filing reports with 
her superiors detailing concerns 
with the hospital’s new remote 
heartbeat monitoring program in 
Summer 2017. She was met with 
little-to-no response from the 
Michigan Medicine administra-
tion.

Beginning in July 2017, Michi-

gan Medicine moved almost all 
cardiology 
patients 
— 
outside 

of the intensive care unit — to a 
remote heart rate monitoring sys-
tem, referred to as remote telem-
etry, that largely replaced licensed 
nurses with technicians. Before 
then, almost all hospital patients 
with heart monitors had their 
heart rates monitored by live nurs-
es; outside of eight patients linked 
to a limited remote screening pro-

gram moni-
tored by a single nurse.

As soon as Michigan Medicine 

began using remote telemetry was 
rolled out in scale, Duncan and 
other nurses in her unit began 
experiencing issues with the tech-
nicians.

“Sometimes I found 

myself having to edu-
cate (the technicians) 
when 
they 
didn’t 

report an incident in 
time or didn’t report 
it at all,” Duncan said. 
“We 
noticed 
lags. 

Sometimes 
a 
heart 

rhythm would change 
and they would never 
call or call much later. 
Often, 
they 
didn’t 

know what it was, 
which was alarming. They’re sup-
posed to be trained.”

Duncan 

explained 
technicians 
are stationed 
in the base-
ment of their 
respective 
unit to watch 
the 
heart 

monitors and 
report 
back 

to the nurses 
when chang-
es occur; she 
added 
there 

were no sen-
tinel 
events 

in her unit, 
but there was 
still concern 
about 
harm 

coming to the 

patients.

Technicians within the remote 

telemetry unit typically monitor 40 
patients at a time and are allowed 
to monitor up to 64 patients, 
according to Duncan, a stark con-
trast to the personalized attention 
nurses could offer patients when 

they were only able to see three at 
a time. Before the hospital began 
employing the technicians, only 
eight of the unit’s patients were 
monitored remotely by a single 
nurse in the cardiology unit base-
ment for the cardiology unit, while 
all the other patients with heart 
monitors had in-person monitor-
ing by nurses.

While the technicians work 

in 
the 
basement, 
technicians 

and nurses within the hospital 
do not interact personally. Dun-
can explained the only contact 
the nurses within her unit had 
with the technicians was over the 
phone. The lack of contact within 
the cardiology unit resulted in 
hostility between the two groups.

“I think the technicians thought 

we didn’t trust them after we 
started filing incident reports,” 
Duncan said.

Many nurses such as Duncan 

believe the hospital’s implemen-
tation of remote telemetry with 
technicians reflects a devaluation 
of nurses under a management cul-
ture at Michigan Medicine that has 
become increasingly profit-driven 
at the expense of staff and patients. 

Ian Robinson, the president of the 
Huron Valley Area Labor Federa-
tion — who was involved in the 
recent nurses’ strike — said he 
has seen a drastic shift at Michi-
gan Medicine toward a corporate 
mindset.

“It’s a new model that is taking 

place at the University,” Robinson 
said. “It is a model that has moved 
from focusing on the interests of 
the public to profit.”

In an email statement, Michigan 

Medicine senior communications 
representative 
Beata 
Mostafavi 

said the hospital’s new remote 
telemetry practices were intended 
to improve patient care by enabling 
immediate, continuous monitoring 
and by facilitating greater collabo-
ration across hospital staff.

“Remote 
telemetry 
provides 

real-time monitoring of patients 
who are at risk for cardiac events, 
significantly improving the ability 

to observe and monitor hospital-
ized patients’ hearts around-the-
clock,” Mostafavi wrote. “A skilled, 
highly trained team of registered 
nurses, cardiac technicians and 
other Michigan Medicine staff 
monitor patients in every unit that 
has cardiac monitoring. These 
teams 
collaborate 
to 
interpret 

patient cardiac rhythms and iden-
tify patients who require clinical 
attention, which helps improve 
patient care and outcomes.”

Despite 
Michigan 
Medicine’s 

claims, Duncan fears the practice 
has actually created a barrier for 
communication at the hospital and 
the lapses of communication that 
seem to accompany the practice 
could negatively impact patients’ 
health.

“Overall, we feel that remote 

telemetry is a barrier to interdis-
ciplinary 
communication, 
and 

can result in delay of care; both of 

which can result in negative out-
comes for the patients and family,” 
Duncan wrote.

Though the University invested 

a significant amount of money in 
the change — it remodeled a level 

of the basement and purchased 
new monitors — Duncan believes 
this was part of a long-term strat-
egy by Michigan Medicine to cut 
costs by reducing the number of 
nurses needed, at the expense of 
patient care.

“Remote telemetry isn’t a cut-

back issue,” she said. “They spent a 
significant amount of money on it, 
but in the long run it’s speculated 
they invested in remote telemetry 
in order to possibly down-staff 
nursing in the future. If they don’t 
need a nurse to monitor a patient’s 
heart and a technician can monitor 
more hearts at once then they can 
staff less nurses.”
W

hile staffing has been 
a key issue in the 100 
days of bargaining-

leading to the University of Michi-
gan Professional Nurse Council’s 
tentative contract agreement with 
Michigan Medicine, nurses also 

cite 
cutbacks 
Michigan 
Medi-

cine has made in other aspects of 
patient care.

Allison Carroll, a nurse in the 

pediatric hematology and oncology 
unit at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospi-

tal, said budget 
cuts inhibit her 
role as a care-
giver 
to 
her 

patients.

“As 
nurses, 

we feel deval-
ued,” 
Carroll 

said. “We real-
ly aren’t asking 
for 
anything 

we didn’t have 
before.”

Carroll 

explained 
the 

hospital 
used 

to keep graham 
crackers on her 
floor for dia-
betic 
patients 

or 
patients 

undergoing 
chemotherapy 
who struggle to find their appetite, 
but the budget cuts have eliminat-

ed important amenities 
like this.

“We can order them 

through food services 
but it can take up to 
an hour, and by then 
the patient undergoing 
chemotherapy 
might 

have lost their appe-
tite,” Carroll said. “It 
sounds insignificant but 
patients in the oncology 

unit struggle to keep down food.”

Similarly, Lynn Detloff, a nurse 

within 
the 
Brandon 
Newborn 

Intensive Care unit at Mott Chil-
dren’s Hospital, said Michigan 
Medicine’s cutbacks on programs 

designed to support nurses in pro-
viding personal care to patients 
have negatively impacted her role 
as a caregiver.

Detloff explained the hospi-

tal has significantly cut back on 
bereavement trays — trays of food 
that are brought to families follow-
ing the loss of a loved one. 

“If there was a death in our 

unit or any other unit, we would 
set them up for the family so they 
wouldn’t have to leave the bed-
side,” Detloff, the chair of the 
bereavement tray committee in her 
unit, said.

Until a cutback on bereave-

ment trays in May 2018, nurses 
could provide food to up to 15 fam-
ily members per patient. Bereave-
ment trays included anything from 
bagels, cereal, pastries, oatmeal or 
yogurt and juice for breakfast or 
an array of sandwiches and cook-
ies. Now, the nurses are limited to 
offering 8 trays with a limited menu 
of a blueberry muffin and orange 
juice for breakfast or a granola bar 
and a piece of fruit. Michigan Med-
icine did not respond to a question 
about how much these bereave-
ment trays cost, or how much was 
saved in cutting the choice of food.

“The bereavement trays are just 

one of the things we do in the hos-
pital to show empathy for families 
going through a difficult time,” 
Detloff said. “(Michigan Medicine) 
has a surplus of $103 million for the 
2018 budget. It seems heartless for 
them to cut back on bereavement 
trays when it is our job to care for 
families.”

Bereavement trays are not the 

only patient care item Michigan 
Medicine has dropped from their 
budget.

GRAHAM CRACKERS:

Carroll explained the hospital 

also eliminated meal passes, cer-
tificates given to family members 
of patients, typically patients who 
had been in the hospital for a long 
period of time.

“Social workers would give 

the vouchers to families because 
they know what families will be 
there for a while,” Carroll said. 
“It was a way to look out for fami-
lies of extremely sick patients and 
help cut down on their personal 
expenses.”

Ultimately, Detloff said the hos-

pital has made it more difficult for 
nurses to provide genuine, per-
sonalized care. Ironically, when 
Michigan 
Medicine 
launched 

its Victors Care concierge care 
service in Spring 2018 — which 
offered more personalized medi-
cal attention for patients willing 
to pay a costly membership view 
— it drew criticism from many 
hospital staff for being elitist and 
exclusionary.

“Michigan Medicine puts nurs-

es at a disadvantage when they 
take away things like meal pass-
es,” Detloff said. “We want to take 
care of them. We want to comfort 
the crying child, offer to send 
them down for food or give them 
something, but we can’t. We want 
to buy them food with our own 
money but we’d get in trouble for 
that too.”
W

hile Detloff and Car-
roll explained cut-
backs by Michigan 

Medicine have made it more dif-
ficult to care for their patients 
both physically and emotionally, 
Duncan said the nurses in her unit 
fear for their patients’ health and 
feel obligated to hold the hospi-
tal accountable. As a result, these 
nurses took a stand against the 
practice of having technicians 
conduct remote telemetry.

According to Duncan, when she 

and other nurses expressed their 
fears of patients’ heart arrhyth-
mias going unnoticed by the tech-
nicians, they were told by their 
managers to write up incident 
reports detailing their safety con-
cerns. The nurses documented the 
lapses in the technicians’ respons-
es to irregular heart rhythms with 
forms called Assignment Despite 
Objection. ADOs allow the nurses 
to notify management of a poten-
tial issue that could be detrimen-
tal to patients as well as maintain 
documentation for their own job 
safety.

“It was really alarming for all 

of us once (remote telemetry with 

technicians) started that this 
was happening,” Duncan said. 
“We would print a copy of the 

rhythm strip, go back through 
the monitor and find the event, 
print it and attach it to an incident 
report. We must have filed dozens 
over the course of months.”

Due to the strong response from 

nurses within Duncan’s unit, 7C, 
Michigan Medicine temporarily 
suspended the practice of remote 
telemetry in Fall 2017, but only 
from 7C. The hospital maintained 
the practice throughout the hospi-
tal and in other cardiology units 
like 7B. The practice was rein-
stated in Duncan’s unit in January 
2018.

After that reinstatement, nurs-

es began filling reports on the 
same issues again, to which they 
received no response from the 
hospital once more.

In May 2018, the nurses within 

7C took a new approach. They sent 
in ADOs to the union represent-
ing the 6,000 registered nurses in 
University of Michigan Hospitals 
— the UMPNC — instead of solely 
to Michigan Medicine. This esca-
lation began to bear fruit.

“We noticed once we got the 

union involved that’s when (Mich-
igan Medicine) began to listen to 
us,” Duncan said.

As a result of the 7C nurses’ 

reports and the union’s support, 
the hospital relented and remote 
telemetry was removed from 7C in 
July 2018. However, the practice 
was not removed from any other 
units within the hospital, includ-
ing the 7B cardiology units.

“Remote 
telemetry 

was 
implemented 
in 

other units in the hos-
pital and is still used 
today,” Duncan contin-
ued. “It’s just an exam-
ple of the squeaky wheel 
getting the oil because 
other units haven’t filed 
reports.”

When remote telem-

etry with technicians 
was first implemented 
at Michigan Medicine 
in July 2017, it was used 
across the hospital — 
not just for monitoring 
patients within the car-
diology unit.

Duncan 
explained 

remote telemetry is not 
used on every patient 
because 
not 
every 

patient within the hos-
pital needs to have his or 
her heart monitored, but 
many patients outside the 
cardiology unit are moni-

tored for potential complications 
— now through remote telemetry.

“An example of a patient on a 

general care unit that may require 
cardiac monitoring could possibly 
be someone who came into the hos-
pital for knee surgery but is having 
complications from the surgery 
that may result in dehydration 
and electrolyte imbalances which 
can cause heart arrhythmias (an 
abnormal rhythm) or maybe that 
patient who just had knee surgery 
has a history of some irregular 
heart rhythm so the doctors might 
want to monitor their heart more 
closely while they recover from 

that surgery,” Duncan wrote.

As far as Duncan knows, her 

unit was the only unit within the 
hospital to file incident reports 
detailing the negative effects of 
remote telemetry.

Duncan owes her unit’s prompt 

response to the faulty practice 
to the remaining monitors in her 
unit. When remote telemetry was 
implemented, other units in the 
hospital lost their heart monitors. 
Their only source of information 
on a patient’s heart rhythm was 

through the technicians.

Therefore, other units would 

not be able to see any lapses in the 
reports from the technicians. The 
failure to address heart arrhyth-
mias could lead to other medical 
complications, Duncan explained. 
If a nurse is never informed of 
the heart arrhythmia or is not 
informed in a timely manner, 
the nurse has no way of reacting 
appropriately to the arrhythmia, 
nor of correlating the abnormal 
heart rhythm to its corresponding 
complication.

While Detloff, Carroll, Duncan 

and 6,000 other UMPNC nurses 

continue to detail other cutbacks 
by Michigan Medicine such as the 
elimination of parking passes for 
families and cutting the patient 
sitter budget in half, the three 
nurses agree they will continue 
to fight for safer staffing, a bet-
ter contract and the importance of 
thoughtful patient care.

“It started out with taking 

away graham crackers,” Detloff 
said. “Now it’s meal tickets and 
bereavement trays. What are they 
going to cut next?”

What are they going to cut next?”


I 

worked as a software engineer at 
a startup in Ann Arbor over the 
summer, and for the first several 

weeks I was marred with a recognizable 
inner turmoil. I would get a task, try to 
do it, eventually stop making progress 
and then begin to think I was in over my 
head and bound to fail. This overwhelming 
sensation would spread, affecting the 
rest of my work tasks. It would follow me 
home, eventually leading me to question 
my decisions and self-confidence in 
situations beyond work. I might wake up 
the next day feeling dejected because I’m 
not good enough and start my day on the 
wrong foot.

After a month of this cycle, I realized I 

needed to make a change. I had started daily 
meditation a couple years back because of a 
class recommended by a friend — Jazz 450: 
Contemplative Practices. Additionally, I 
had been using a workbook called “The 
Artist’s Way,” by Julia Cameron, for 
the past month in order to improve my 
creativity and become a better writer. 
Both of these pushed me to reconsider my 
idea of self-conception, which ultimately 
pushed me to better my thinking habits. 
The changes I’ve experienced have had a 
huge impact on me, inspiring me to write 
and reflect on them.

Self-conception is a sense of self 

based in one’s beliefs and experiences. It 
affects things like how outgoing we are, 
how we tackle challenges, and how we 
treat ourselves and others. If a person 
believes they aren’t good looking or 
charismatic, then it’s likely they will lack 
the confidence to try things at which 
they might otherwise succeed. Given the 
impact of self-conception, it’s worthy of 
more attention. It’s something that crops 
up from our successes and failures, how 
others have treated us and life events over 
which we have minimal control.

By disassociating from my negative 

thoughts over the past few weeks, I’ve 
been trying to actively engage with my self-
conception. I’ve been searching my past for 
events that have significantly influenced 
me while also using affirmations to 
redirect my self-vision. Two insights have 
led me in this process.

The first insight stemmed from my 

daily mindfulness meditation practice. 
An important part of the practice is the 
ability to recognize thoughts without 
identifying with them, and choosing to 
refocus attention back on the breath. 
When meditators realize they are getting 
distracted by their thoughts, they label 
them “thinking,” “self-doubt,” “future 
to-dos,” “jealousy” and so on; then they 
refocus on the breath. By labeling them 
and choosing to focus on the breath, the 
meditator distances themselves from their 
thoughts.

This brings me to the first insight: I 

can detach my thoughts from my self-

conception. For example, I realized just 
because I had a thought, such as “I’m 
not good enough,” it didn’t mean I had to 
identify with it. A pretty simple realization, 
right? But we’ll see its power in a moment.

The second insight comes from “The 

Artist’s Way”. It provides weekly exercises 
to help the reader nurture and heal their 
creativity. In the first week of using the 
book, I excavated my past to find the 
roots of the beliefs I held about myself, 
my abilities and my motivations. The 
workbook asked me to break my past into 
five-year increments and recall specific 
instances within each time frame that had 
been memorable and formative, whether 
positive or negative.

An important aspect of this self-

excavation is the idea that forgotten past 
experiences are often the roots of one’s self 
image and actions. Unfortunately, a lot of 
these experiences can be negative because 
of humans’ uncanny ability to over-focus 
on negativity. Sometimes these negative 
experiences 
perpetuate 
unconscious 

doubts and beliefs regarding the self.

This exercise helped me uproot self-

incriminating beliefs through affirmations 
and gradual lifestyle changes. This leads to 
the second insight: The underlying beliefs, 
values and assumptions I hold about myself 
and the world can be re-directed, changed 
or abolished. Through this practice, I 
began to interact with the scaffolding 
that defines who I am. This comes with 

the implication that not questioning these 
underlying beliefs leads to not having a say 
in who I am becoming.

Once I connected these ideas and 

realized I had the power to question my 
thoughts, I was able to both separate my 
thoughts from my self-conception, label 
from where the self-doubt came and 
redirect my beliefs. Here’s how it went.

When I was at work, got stuck and had a 

thought of self-doubt, I would take a deep 
breath and think about how 1) I hadn’t 
even failed yet and 2) Even if I did fail, any 
single failure didn’t constitute who I was. 
I didn’t have to identify with the failure. I 
would remind myself of positive qualities I 
did want to identify with, like having grit, 
being optimistic and being resourceful.

I then incorporated self-excavation. I 

searched my past to find the roots of the 
monsters whispering in my ear, “You’re 
not good enough. You’re going to fail,” 
and identified they were connected with 
forgotten memories of a soccer coach 
being too hard on me in high school and 
older teammates telling me I wasn’t good 
enough to be on the team.

Labeling the roots of the issue really 

lightened my mindset on the subject. 
While at work, I had been worried I was 
failing and everyone else thought so too, 
but realizing “everyone” was really just 
thoughts floating around in my head that 
stemmed from past experiences helped me 
loosen the hold of these beliefs.

“I have important things to say.”
“I will move forward; I will land on my 

feet.”

“Being myself will lead to creative 

success.”

“Be calm; take one step at a time.”
These are a few of the affirmations I 

read aloud to myself every morning and 
whenever I felt overwhelmed throughout 
the day. Affirmations are one of the biggest 
steps I’ve been taking toward actively 
engaging with my self-conception.

Now, when I am at work and get 

overwhelmed, I’m able to stay positive, 
keep moving forward as best I can 
and disassociate myself from negative 
thoughts. Sure, I’ll fail sometimes. But 
failures are slowly becoming less of a 
personal problem than a pragmatic issue. 
It’s much easier to pick myself back up 
when I don’t identity with them.

The cool thing about this process is that it 

requires me to think about who I currently 
am, why I am that way and who I want to 
be. Disassociation between thought and 
self helps me to recognize which voices in 
my head I do and don’t want to listen to. 
Self-excavation helps me address issues I 
might otherwise ignore or run away from. 
Affirmations help me engage with myself 
in ways that lead to positive self-growth 
in directions I’ve explicitly determined. 
I believe this process can be used more 
widely, and to help others get on track 
toward happier lives, too.
