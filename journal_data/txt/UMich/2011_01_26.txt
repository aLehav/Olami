President stresses
need to cut
domestic spending
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
President Barack Obama's
delivered his annual State of
the Union address last night in
the nation's capital, stressing
the importance of bipartisan-

ship particularly in regard to
issues of fiscal and economic
policy.
Among the topics Obama
addressed was education
reform which he said is a factor
in encouraging more diversi-
fied job creation and re-estab-
lishing the country as a global
force. He also focused on the
growth of technology and sus-
tainable initiatives, calling this .
effort "our generation's Sputnik
moment."

In his speech, Obama said
that since Republicans now
hold a majority in the U.S.
House of Representatives, the
two chambersof Congress must
make an effort to work together
to solve national issues rather
than get caught up in partisan
bickering that has plagued past
split Congresses.
"With their votes, the Amer-
ican people determined that
governing will now be a shared
responsibility between par-

ties," Obama said. "New laws
will only pass with support
from Democrats and Repub-
licans. We will move forward
together, or not at all, for the
challenges we face are bigger
than party, and bigger than
politics."

versity professor of commu-

Hats off to linear algebra

Q: What classes do you
teach at the University
I teach whatever they tell
me to teach. The ones I've
taught the most often are
linear algebra. There are six
different classes of linear
algebra here. I teach two of
them. But the one for which
I get the most notoriety for is
the "Geometry for Teachers"
class, which is a math class,
but it's a requirement for
many education majors.
Q: Why is that the class
you're most famous for?
I think alot of people come
tothatclassexpectingtolearn
basic geometry, the kind of
things they would themselves
be teaching and that's exactly

what I don't do. I teach them
real mathematics: projec-
tive geometry, non-Euclidean
geometry, mathematics rea-
soning.
Q: What is your class-
roomlike?
It depends on what I'm
teaching. But no matter how
the class is set up, I always
want people to feel that they
can ask questions whenever
they have them because I
think that's really important.
Q:Doyoudo anyresearch
at the University?
My primary area is num-
ber theory, which is a pretty
big area, I'm aware. So I
guess let's just say very seri-
ous number theory and also

knot theory. The number the-
ory department is small, but
enthusiastic. My research is
very important to me. I try to
strike a balance between my
research world and my educa-
tion world.
Q: Can you tell us why
you have the nickname
"Cap"?
The explanation is very
simple. As you can see, I'm
wearing a deerstalker (hat)
right now, that's my most pop-
ular cap. But I have a whole
sort of caps, and I started
wearing a tree driving cap.
These are very trendy now.
But I really stood out, and
people starting calling me
Cap.

Q: Is it true that you wear
a different hat every day?
No, no, that's not true. I do
have an array. I do come in
with funny hats from time to
time.I have a pirate hat, a Mad
Hatter hat. I have many hats.

OBAMA
From Page 1A
said in an interview last night
that he found the speech to be
"particularly low key." Obama
didn't go into detail about many
issues, Traugott said, leaving
little for the House Republicans
to be discontented with.
"I don't think that he want-
ed to strike a belligerent tone,
he wanted to strike an accom-
modating tone," Traugott said.
"And so by being relatively
vague rather than quite specif-
ic, he provided very few targets
for the Republicans to attack."
In his address, Obama also
stressed that his re-election
endeavor isn't the most pressing
issue for his administration in
the coming year, but rather, it is
ensuring the continual growth
of the national economy and job
development.
"At stake right now is not
who wins the next election,"
Obama said. "After all, we just
had an election. At stake is
whether new jobs and indus-
tries take root in this country,
or somewhere else. It's whether
the hard work and industry
of our people is rewarded. It's
whether we sustain the leader-
ship that has made America not
just a place on a map, but a light
to the world."
Obama continued by saying
that the economy has demon-
strated growth since he took
office and that it is in a position
to keep climbing, particularly
through strengthening national
programs in areas like educa-
tion.
"We are poised for progress,"
Obama said. "Two years after
the worst recession most of
us have ever known, the stock
market has come roaring back.
Corporate profits are up. The
economy is growing again."
As part of his efforts to
reduce the national deficit as
well as appeal to both sides of
the aisle, Obama proposed a
domestic spending freeze over
the next five years that would
reduce the national deficit by by
more than $400 billion.
In a statement released fol-
lowing Obama's speech, U.S.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
lauded Obama's initiative to

consolidate'areas of federal
government and make "precise
and rational spending cuts."
However, Dingell wrote that a
total freeze on domestic spend-
ing fails to deal with more spe-
cific fiscal issues.
"I personally think a bud-
get freeze would be an ineffi-
cient and arbitrary way to deal
with the problem; it would not
take into consideration spe-
cific problems and issues that
we face today," Dingell wrote.
"Nonetheless, I stand ready to
work with my colleagues and
the President to find respon-
sible and effective ways to trim
the budget."
Despite the freeze on domes-
tic funding, Traugott said he
thinks Obama will still make
concessions on federal fund-
ing for universities to continue
the administration's priority on
research.
Traugott said he expects
Obama will also extend such
initiatives to global sustain-
ability and the advancement of
information technology careers
- sectors that Obama discussed
in his speech and that have
prominent programs at the Uni-
versity.
"I think that this is all part
of his proposal to expand the
knowledge-based economy and
also the new forms of technol-
ogy to replace rustbelt manu-
facturing," Traugott said. "I
think that he has a good chance
of succeeding with this, and I
think the University would ben-
efit ultimately from this."
Obama's focus on "Race to
the Top" initiatives to regain
America's position as a front-
runner in education is validat-
ed, Traugott said. But it is also
complicated since education is
often an issue best dealt with at
the local and state level, which
has been particularly difficult
to sustain amid tight budgets in
many states, Traugott said.
"I don't think there's any
question that we need a bet-
ter educated, highly educated
workforce," Traugott said. "It's
a complicated issue because
generally primary and second-
ary education are funded by
local property taxes, and when
you go into a recession and
there's a downturn in the econ-
omy, the tax revenues dry up.

So they're trying to find a way
for the federal government to
help in an area where state and
local government has primary
responsibility."
LSA junior Brendan Camp-
bell, chair of the University's
chapter of College Democrats,
said in an interview last night
that he thought Obama's speech
was "an effective and passion-
ate call for bipartisanship" that
reflected the president's prog-
ress over the past two years.
"I hope that in the next two
years Republicans in Congress
will heed (Obama's) call and
work with him to continue
moving this country forward,"
Campbell said.
As for the domestic spend-
ing freeze, Campbell said that
while this will be difficult for
the Democratic Party to accept,
it is essential for easing the
national debt.
"While difficult, his plan
for freezing spending over the
next five years will prove to be
an important part of putting
the country back on track, and
making sure that our deficit
does not continue to grow out of
control," Campbell said.
LSA junior Charles Bogren,
chair of the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans, said
that though Obama's speech
was strong in promoting bipar-
tisanship, the president failed
to fully address key issues fac-
ing the nation.
"I think that just as President
Obama spoke primarily about
economic issues, most of us
Republicans are really looking
toward how he's going to han-
dle the next year with regards
to health care and with the cor-
porate taxes that he's talking
about," Bogren said.
While Obama's rhetoric
may be encouraging bipartisan
efforts, Bogren said, Obama
is also using the Democratic-
controlled Senate as a means
of blocking legislation that is
important to the nation.
"I think one thing you're
going to have to watch out for is
the idea that the president real-
ly can have his majority in the
Senate be the buffer between
what is basically best for Amer-
ica and what the liberals and
the Democratic Party wants,"
Bogren said.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Unemployment
rises in 20 states,
falls in 15 others
The unemployment rate rose in
20 states last month as employers
in most states shed jobs.
The Labor Department says
the unemployment rate rose in
20 states and fell in 15. It was
unchanged in another 15 states.
That's nearly the same as in
November, when the rate rose in
21 states, fell in 15 and was the
same in 14.
The report is evidence that the
job market is barely improving
even as the economy grows. Most
economists expect hiring to pick
up this year, although the unem-
ployment rate will likely remain
high.
TRENTON, N.J.
Governor: State
won't repay U.S.
for tunnel work
Gov. Chris Christie said yester-
day that New Jersey will contin-
ue its fight to avoid repaying the
federal government $271 million
spent on the Hudson River rail
tunnel project that he canceled in
October.
The deadline for the state to
repay the money or file a formal
appeal was last night.
Christie said on an appearance
on West Trenton news radio sta-
tion 101.5 that the state does not
intend to pay.
Christie spokesman Michael
Drewniak said the administration
would have more details today on
an appeal.
The $8.7 billion project was the
most expensive public works proj-
ect in the country when Christie
spiked it. It would have doubled
the capacity for trains travel-
ing between New York City and
New Jersey, routes that are now
close to capacity and frequently
delayed.
MOGADISHU, Somalia
With draught,
Somalis march to
demand aid
Hundreds of Somalis are
marching through the capital
demanding aid for their drought-
stricken country.
The aid group Oxfam says
half a million Somalis have been
affected by the drought. The U.N.
says one in six children is acutely
malnourished.
Somalia has been torn apart
by civil war for 20 years and the
ongoing conflict is hampering
relief efforts. Insurgents issued
restricted which led the U.N.
to stop distributing aid in areas
under their control.
Those who held the demon-

they are notbeinghelped because
they live in a part of the city out-

side insurgent control.
HARARE, Zimbabwe
Wildlife director
reports sharp rise
in rhino poaching
Poachers are using aircraft to
hunt and kill rhinoceros, Zimba-
bwe's wildlife chief said yester-
day, as demand in Asia for their
horns' supposed medicinal ben-
efits grows.
Seven endangered rhinos were
killed in southern Zimbabwe
from early December to Jan. 19,
representing about one-third of
all 22 rhinos poached throughout
2010, Parks and Wildlife director
general Vitalis Chidenga.
He said the poachers, including
localrecruits,were well-equipped
with sophisticated weapons. Five
of the rhino were shot in one park
in the southwestern Matabele-
land province, he said.
Rhino horn is prized in Asia as
a traditional cure for everything
from colds to impotence and it is
used to fashion ceremonial dag-
ger handles in oil-rich countries
in the Middle East.

START treaty
limits number of
U.S., Russia
nuclear aresenals
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's
lower house of parliament rati-
fied a landmark nuclear arms
pact with the United States yes-
terday, virtually assuring pas-
sage of an agreement President
Barack Obama has described as
the most significant arms control
deal in nearly two decades.
The State Duma voted 350-96
with one abstention to pass a bill
to ratify the New START treaty,
which was approved by the U.S.
Senate late last year. The treaty
will now go to the upper house
for final approval.
The New START would limit
each country to 1,550 strategic
warheads, down from the cur-
rent ceiling of 2,200 and also
re-establish a system for moni-
toring that ended in December
2009 with the expiration of the
1991 Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty signed by Soviet Presi-
dent Mikhail Gorbachev and
President George H.W. Bush.
The treaty's passage has never
been in doubt in the Kremlin-
controlled parliament, but
Russian lawmakers wanted to
counter a U.S. Senate resolu-
tion raising some Republican
concerns that accompanied the
December ratification by adding
on a similar motion.
Obama pressed strongly for
the pact's approval, and Demo-
crats sought to appease some
Republican senators by allow-
ing them to raise their concerns
about the treaty in the accompa-
nying resolution.
Neither the Senate, nor the

Duma resolution would affect
the text of the treaty, which is a
centerpiece of Obama's efforts to
"reset" ties with Russia.
While the Senate resolution
said the treaty shouldn't restrict
U.S. plans to develop a missile
defense system, the Duma rati-
fication bill states that the treaty
can only be fulfilled if emerging
missile defenses don't erode the
Russian nuclear deterrent.
The Russian draft bill also
mimics the Senate resolution's
concerns that the remaining
nuclear arsenal is effective by
emphasizing the need to mod-
ernize Russia's nuclear forces.
The Russian legislators said
they felt obliged to present their
view of the treaty's provisions,
given the Senate interpretation.
"The State Duma proceeds
from the assumption that the
New START- treaty can be
functioning and viable only
in conditions when there is
no quantitative and qualita-
tive buildup of the U.S. mis-
sile defense systems, developed
independently or jointly with
other countries," the Duma said
in a statement accompanying the
passage of the ratification bill.
NATO has approved a plan
for a U.S.-led missile defense in
Europe last fall and invited Rus-
sia to join. Russia's President
Dmitry Medvedev was receptive
of NATO's proposal but didn't
makea definitive commitment.
Medvedev has warned that
the failure to reach agreement on
a joint European missile shield
with Moscow may force Russia
to deploy new offensive weapons
and trigger a new arms race.
In its statement yesterday, the
Duma also turned a cold shoul-
der to the U.S. push for a quick
start of U.S.-Russian talks to cut
short-range nuclear weapons.

Banish the ban
'U' needs a better solution for smoking concerns
The plans for the University's campus-wide smoking ban are
officially coming to fruition. The Smoke-free University Ini-
tiative Report - released Monday - details plans to carry-out
and enforce the ban. While University officials seem optimistic about
the future of the ban,it's actually an expensive and overbearing policy.
There are avariety of smoking rules in place on campus that are unen-
forced. And with the plans mentioned in the report, it seems that the
new rules will likely make little difference in creating a smoke-free
environment on campus. The University should rethink how it will
implement the smoking ban and make the rules less arbitrary.

University President Mary Sue Coleman
first announced plans for a smoking ban ini-
tiative in April 2009. The ban would extend
to all three University campuses. After a year
andahalfofplanning, theUniversityreleased
its official plans on Monday that explained
how it would implement the ban, according
to a Jan. 24 Daily article. The report included
14 points about where smokers could smoke
on University grounds. Smoking is prohibited
in all University buildings and specific Uni-
versity sidewalks. Smoking is also prohibited
in University parking structures, unless the
smoker lights a cigarette inside his or her car.
The ban is set to take effect on July 1, 2011.
The rules outlined in the report are over-
bearing. To expect students - who aren't
full-time Ann A/bor residents - to distin-
guish sidewalks that run adjacent to pub-
lic roads and sidewalks that run adjacent to
private roadsjis unrealistic. And if a person
is foup spoking on the non-smoking side-
walkd. " her they're ware or unaware
of theiritrxgression - tre is virtually no
punishment. No tickets will be issued, and
no arrests will be made. The only realistic
outcome is that the smoker's friend or some-
one in the vicinity will mention it. This is not

implementation worth a $200,000 plus ini-
tiative.
Not only is the initiative largelyunenforce-
able, it fails to recognize that there are smok-
ing regulations in place that are unenforced.
The University already has strict guidelines
about smoking near campus buildings, but
rarely, if ever, is the regulation made obliga-
tory. The University should have examined
why those rules weren't functioning properly
before they decided to implement a far more
pervasive set of restrictions.
Despite the University's good intentions to
make the campus a healthier environment,
it has no right to tell smokers they cannot
smoke. Smoking is legal in the state of Michi-
gan as long as a person isn't smoking inside
a public place. If those guidelines are effec-
tively implemented throughout the state, the
University shouldn't create its own separate
rules. And though second-hand smoke is
dangerous, forcing people to quit smoking
because they have nowhere to legally smoke
on campus is unfair.
While the University is its own commu-
nity, its purpose is to prepare young adults to
enter into the real world where, like it or not,
people smoke.

50 million. That's how much
Google paid Nathan Stoll of
Stanford University and his
team to acquire
their search-
engine company,
Aardvark. My
business team
eagerly takes
notes as we hear
his story. The
next day, anoth-
er team talks to ERIK
a senior execu- TORENBERG
tive at Comcast,
inquiring about
the market for interactive TVs.
We're in ENGR 409, a two-week,
one credit course offered through
the University's Center for Entre-
preneurship.
The CFE, formed in 2008, offers
a growing number of courses and
resources available to all students
interested in business and entre-
preneurship. ENGR 407 hosts a
weekly lecture series that invites
accomplished entrepreneurs to
speak. Most students don't know
about these opportunities. Fewer
know that the Engineering label
is misleading - anyone can take
advantage of the classes offered by
the CFE.
Let me stop you before you steal
your friend's great idea and imag-
ine mass amounts of money flow-
ing into your bank account. Though
"The Social Network" might lead
you to believe otherwise, a great
idea plus start up money doesn't
necessarily equal profit. My other
CFE class, ENGR 520, debunks this
myth, teaching us how to identify
whether our ladder (our idea) is
leaning against the right tree (mar-
ket validation).
Some more debunking: While it
might be inspiring to hear how suc-
cessful entrepreneurs turned their
passion into alucrative reality, most

entrepreneurs don't have such suc-
cess. But you just don't hear those
types of lectures. How often do you
hear an adult say that following his
passions screwed him over in the
long run?
Don't let this deter you. Not
everyone can be a wealthy entre-
preneur, but everyone can be a bit
entrepreneurial. At the recent LSA
career fair, a recruiter told me he
was seeking students who display
an entrepreneurial spirit. He meant
he wanted a student who generates
productive ideas, effectively leads
groups and knows how to make
things happen.
Notice how such skills are differ-
ent from those exemplified by good
students. Being a student trains you
to accomplish predefined tasks and
to game a certain system. Entrepre-
neurship requires gaming a differ-
ent system - the market, in which
the grading rubric is blurry. You
can't become innovative by study-
ing its definition from a PowerPoint
slide. You develop such skills by
pursuing self-designed projects
and learning from your mistakes.
CFE creates such a space, showing
that entrepreneurship isn't only
about hi-tech start-ups. It's also
about assessing what value you can
provide and how you can provide it,
regardless of your major or skill set.
Ben Casnocha, entrepreneur
and author of "My Start-Up Life",
believes that entrepreneurship is a
lifestyle. In his book, he says that
he believes in "thinking different,
challenging the status 4uo, striving
for impact, and generally maintain-
ing a commitment to carve your
own life path and not outsource
that vital task to anyone else like a
parent or professor." These attri-
butes describe Henry David Tho-
reau, Gandhi and Bill Gates. Their
goals might have been different,
but they all demonstrated entrepre-

neurial abilities in achieving them.
Let's define the student entre-
preneur. He isn't only interested in
building businesses. He's also the
political science major who starts
a political organization, using it
as a platform to connect thinkers
from other disciplines. She's the art
major who sets up her own exhibit,
inviting artists from outside the
area with the intent to enliven Ann
Arbor's art community.
The time for
students to take
risks is now.
He plays the student card: Stu-
dents would be amazed at what
they can achieve by cold calling
people in positions of power and
saying "I'm working on this project.
Could you offer any help? I'm a stu-
dent from the University of Michi-
gan."
Most of all, the student entrepre-
neur acknowledges that the time
for taking risks is now, that the cost
of failure - for flip-flopping ideolo-
gies, experimenting and pursuing
all sorts of projects - as a student
will never be lower.
In ENGR 409, we learned to con-
clude our "elevator pitches" to cus-
tomers with a call to action. Here's
mine: The University presents
unparalleled resources to think like
an entrepreneur, but it's too easy
to miss these opportunities. If this
column has piqued your curiosity,
let's talk about how we can be a bit
more entrepreneurial in our Uni-
versity lives.

DANIEL LUKS I
In defense of Israel


0

No more text-aholics

As 2011 begins, no conclusive peace settle-
ment in the Middle East has been reached.
In 2010, the world witnessed a historic
10-month settlement freeze put in place by
the Netanyahu administration. Over the past
year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has taken extraordinary steps to show his
commitment to the peace process and his
desire to see peace in his lifetime.
The Middle East peace talks - which
took place in September of this past year -
failed because of the Palestinian leadership's
demand that all of their preconditions be met
and their refusal to recognize the Jewish
state. Israel was more than willing to negoti-
ate with the Palestinian leadership in hopes
of achieving a new lasting peace agreement.
Israel didn't make demands in advance that
would cause the peace talks to fail because
the Israeli leadership is willing to support an
agreement that would allow Israeli citizens
to live in peace.
Like Yonah Lieberman (March for an
inclusive Israel, 12/10/2010), I too am a Jew.
I was raised to believe in justice and equality
for all and that it's just as important to speak
of these principles as it is to put them into
action.
Similar to any state, Israel isn't perfect.
In the face of extraordinary circumstances
Israel does the best it can to provide justice
and protection for all. Unlike the Palestinian
territories, Israel provides religious, politi-
cal, gender and sexual freedom for everyone.
There's a reason that the gay pride march in
Israel takes place in Tel Aviv and not in the
Palestinian territories. 6
The recent statement by a small grotp of
radical rabbis informing Israeli Jews not to
sell property to non-Jews was met by fierce
criticism from the prime minister. Netanya-
hu was in total opposition to this statement,
while just this past September, Khaled Abu
Toameh from the Jerusalem Post reported
that the prime minister "reaffirmed the
death penalty for any Palestinian found
guilty of selling land to Israelis."

There's a reason that people of any religion
or beliefcan purchase land and own property
in Israel - whereas in many Arab countries,
Jews would be barred from any property
ownership.
A few thousand miles to the south of
Israel, a terrible situation has been going
on in Sudan for many years. In an effort to
flee the violence, many Sudanese attempted
to seek refugee in Egypt. While they were
permitted into the country, these refugees
lacked any form of rights and faced persecu-
tion from the Egyptian government. Only a
few weeks ago in December, The New York
Times reported 23 unarmed Sudanese men,
women and children refugees were shot and
killed by Egyptian police for refusingto leave
a public park. Where did these refugees then
attempt to flee? The answer for many of them
was Israel.
I'm proud of Israel for what it stands for
and for her many accomplishments. Israel
strives to attain a fair and equitable peace
agreement even in the face of such hatred
and violence. Israel has tried time and again
to make peace with the Palestinian people,
but each time is met with resistance from the
Palestinian leadership.
While Lieberman is quick to blame Israel
for any human rights violations, he neglects
to acknowledge the citizens of southern
Israel, whose human rights are violated on
a daily basis. These Israeli citizens continue
to live under the fear of constant rocket and
mortar fire.
As the only democracy in the Middle East,
it's easy to criticize Israel. Israel has a gov-
ernment that is fully accountable to its citi-
zens and is willing to admit when it makes
mistakes. Unfortunately, articles like Lieber-
man's attempt to paint a false picture of a
homeland that has provided justice and ref-
uge to so many.

Public Policy and a member of the Committee for
Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America.

When I got my first cell
phone at age 16, I kept
receiving text messages
intended for the
person who had
the phone num-
ber before me:
"Hey, girl, want
2 go 2 the mall
@ 6?" No, I don't
want to go to the
mall at six, and RACHEL
I'd appreciate it VAN GILDER
if you stopped
asking.
After about a week and a half of
getting messages for the prior owner
of the number, I got so annoyed with
them that I simply had the phone
company turn off my phone's text
messaging capabilities. Almost six
years later, I still don't have texting.
And while this occasionally causes
some miscommunication when
people say, "Oh, I texted you that
I would be late," I'm still glad that
I don't have texting. It seems like
more trouble than it's worth.
It's not the idea of texting that
bugs me. A quick, easy way to pass
along a short message can be very
useful. That's why I love e-mail so
much. The problem is that people
abuse text messaging. It's like they
can't pull their fingers from the key-
pad, even when they're behind the
wheel or interacting with someone
in real life.
Texting while driving is now ille-
gal in Michigan - making it one of
30 states with a similar ban. Shortly
before the law was signed into effect,
the Ann Arbor City Council consid-
ered making texting while driving
illegal here in the city. The Federal
Transportation Department is now
encouraging automotive makers to
fund public service announcements
about the dangers of driving dis-

tracted, accordingto aJan. 21 article
from Reuters.
Texting while driving is extreme-
ly dangerous. In fact, doing almost
anything while driving is a bad idea.
Everybody knows they shouldn't
drive drunk. But drivers also
shouldn't eat or talk on the phone
while they drive. Some people go as
far as applying makeup while driv-
ing. Tasks like these - and texting
- demand attention to fine motor
control and decrease attention to the
road. This increases the likelihood
of an accident.
Everyone has heard how dan-
gerous it is to drive distracted, and
yet people still seem to do it. I'll be
the first to admit that I've made a
call while driving or scarfed down
some fries from McDonald's behind
the wheel even though I know I
shouldn't. But texting is a whole new
level of dangerous. No matter how
much texting practice you have, you
still have to devote too much atten-
tion to the phone and not enough to
the road. Just put the phone away.
People should get their texting
under control - and not just while
they're driving. Texting shouldn't
be used to hold a long, complicated
discussion - especially when the
person texting should be paying
attention to their real-life surround-
ings.
Most often when I say that I don't
have texting, people tell me it'sgreat.
They say that it's so easyto just shoot
someone an e-mail when you're in a
place that you can't talk, like class.
But students shouldn't text dur-
ing class, as I have to tell the high
school students at the school where
I'm currently student teaching. No
matter how sneaky you think you
are as you text beneath the desk, it's
still noticeable and pretty rude to
the instructor and your classmates.

It shows that you're not invested
in the class. If you don't want to
listen to the teacher, just don't go
to class. And since texting can be
used to cheat on tests and quizzes,
it's even more concerning that stu-
dents have no problem whipping
out their phone in the middle of a
lecture hall.
People just can't
pull their fingers
from the keypad.
The worst thing is when people
text during dinner. Iunderstand that
everyone is busy, but when I'm shar-
ing a meal with someone, I expect
them to keep their attention on me
and our other companions. Hope-
fully, they wouldn't answer a phone
call during dinner in the midst of a
conversation. Why would they hold
a full conversation with another per-
son via text messaging when they're
supposed to be connecting with the
person across the table? If you need
to text, please leave the table and go
into another room.
I love the idea of being connected
all the time - of always being able to
contact anyone. But there has to be
a limit. There has to be a time when
we put the phone away and fosus on
what's going on in front of us. Some-
times that's simply the safe thing to
do (like during driving) and some-
times it's the polite thing to do.
So don't text me, OK? I won't get
it anyway.

DEBATE TEAM
From Page 1A
appointed to the team at the
beginning of last semester. The
team's former director, Joshua
Hoe, pled guilty in October
to sexually soliciting a minor
over the Internet. Hoe was sus-
pended from his job after being
arrested last April, according to
an April 29, 2010 Michigan Daily
article.
LSA Junior Omega Skeean,
a member of the debate team,
said while the group has expe-
rienced difficulties over the past
few years, it is now on a positive
trajectory. She added that Kall
has done a lot of administrative
work to improve the team's rela-
tionship with the University.
In the tournament, Liu and
Zagorin's topic of debate was the
expansion of immigration visas
worldwide.
"We talked about things like
employment visas to increase
U.S. competition (and) visas for
translators in Iraq and Afghani-
stan," Liu said.
Skeean commended the effort
that Liu and Zagorin put into the
competition, as well as the work
of the team as a whole.
MSA
From Page 1A
expressed concern that Sayed
wasn't present at the meeting
to answer questions from rep-
resentatives about the $395,577
budget. Eral also expressed
concern about a $40,000 dis-
crepancy between the budget
presented at last night's meet-
ing and a preview presented to
MSA last week.
"My biggest objection with
it is that the total revenue
increased $40,000 since we saw
it last week," Eral said.
LSA Rep. Brendan Friedman,
chair of MSA's Resolutions
Committee, also expressed con-
cerns about the budget at last
night's meeting.

"I was extremely happy for
Edmund and Maria, and they
deserve any success they get,"
Skeean said.
Whit Whitmore and Nick
Miller, assistant coaches for the
University's Debate Team, also
contributed to the success of the
team, Skeean said.
"They're there everyday to
help us practice, doing things
with us like speaking drills,"
Skeean said.
Engineering freshman Akum
Gill said the team began practic-
ing in August 2010. Though they
thrive in a competitive environ-
ment, all the debate team mem-
bers agree that they're like a
family.
"It's a great, strong dynamic
just like any other sports team.
that spends alot of time together
andworkingtogether,"Kall said.
Kall said the debate team's
competitiveness is just like
a sports team. With 13 or 14
competitions a year, Kall said
debate has about the same num-
ber of competitions as a college
football team. Members also
compete against other Big Ten
universities like Northwestern
University and Michigan State
University.
Looking toward the future,

Kall said the team hopes to
recruit more talent.
"Our long-term goals are to
improve the program," he said.
"Edmund, our top debater, is
graduating. We need to find
the next Edmund, or the next
Denard Robinson, in debate."
Kall said University admin-
istrators are also working to
recruit top debating students to
the school and to the team. To
achieve this goal, the team has a
summer program for high school
students, and members of the
debate team are in the process
ofsettingup scholarships forthe
best high school debaters.
The team also hopes to estab-
lish a scholarship fund with con-
tributions from the extensive
network of debate team alumni,
Kall said.
"A lot of our competitors give
them away as well, and we want
to compete for the best stu-
dents," he said.
Kall added that last week's
win will help the recruitment
process.
"When (recruits) see the suc-
cess and tournament victory, it
shows that Michigan is a place
that they can debate at the high-
est level," he said.

ISRAEL
From Page 1A
Movement for Israel, accord-
ing to Canning. But this time,
WolvPAC has adopted different
methods to gain support from a
large number of students, Can-
ning wrote.
"We're taking a different
approach from what has been
done in the past," Canning
wrote. "Before, AMI made pre-
sentations to the University's
International Travel Oversight
Committee. There has never
been a grassroots effort showing
support from the general stu-
dent body."
The issue was first introduced
to WolvPAC last year when the
organization discovered that
Michigan State University had
created a study abroad program
in Israel. This sparked discon-
tent among the group's members
regarding University of Michi-
gan study abroad programming,
Canning wrote.
"Since winter 2010, we have
been brainstorming different
strategies to show (how the)
committee failing to revise its
study abroad policy towards
Israel would negatively impact
the University's position as a
leading global institution com-
mitted to academic excellence
and comprehensive global
understanding," Canning wrote.
"Almost every major institution
has a study abroad program in
Israel."
Students who want to study
in Israel have to do so through
programs offered at other uni-
versities. However, this is often
a more difficult process and
deters students from the oppor-
tunity, Canning wrote.
"They must withdraw from
the University, preventing them
from transferring financial
aid and grades," Canning said.
"Unfortunately, a lot of people
do not go to Israel when they
would, because there isn't an
official University program."
University policy regard-
ing travel advisories is also an

important factor in instituting
study abroad programs.
According to Canning, a
warning was issued by the State
Department for travel to Israel,
the West Bank and Gaza in 2001.
"Since then the security situa-
tion has greatly improved," Can-
ning wrote.
But according to the State
Department website, a travel
warning to Israel, the West
Bank and Gaza was also issued
on Aug. 10, 2010.
John Godfrey, assistant
dean for International Educa-
tion at Rackham, wrote in an
e-mail interview that security
issues are essential to consider
when assessing study abroad
programming. It is against the
University's international travel
policies to sponsor programs
in countries in which a travel
warning has been issued by
the State Department, Godfrey
wrote.
"We want the students (to)
understand the safety, secu-
rity and health conditions in
the places they're traveling and
that they aren't making plans
for places that pose exceptional
risk," Godfrey wrote. "Students
are also asked to register their
travel information with the U-M
Travel Registry so we know how
to contact them in the event of
an emergency."
LSA sophomore Julie Sherbill,
a member of WolvPAC, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
believes the University's stance
on study abroad opportunities in
Israel and other countries with
travel warnings isn't consistent.
"The University's policy on
State Department travel warn-
ings is not as cut-and-dry as it
seems," Sherbill wrote in the
e-mail interview.
According to Sherbill, the Law
School offered a study abroad
program at Israel's University of
Tel Aviv Law School as recently
as last year.
But according to Godfrey,
the University's current study
abroad programs in Israel, like
the Law School's University of
Tel Aviv program, are restricted

to graduate students.
Canning introduced the peti-
tion to MSA and LSA-SG with
the goal of persuading the bod-
ies to pass a resolution in sup-
port of such a program.
"I feel this would especially
benefit LSA students because
Israel is a leader in so many
fields ranging from medicine, to
sustainability efforts, to politi-
cal science," Canning wrote.
Public Policy junior Steven
Zuckerman, a Public Policy
representative for MSA, intro-
duced a resolution to MSA at last
night's meeting calling on the
Assembly to show their support
for the petition.
Zuckerman said he has
received only positive feedback
since he sent an e-mail to MSA
members regarding the petition.
"I think that if people realize
the bottom line, which is that it's
not a political statement, it's an
actual concern of students that
they can't go abroad and (do it
in) Israel at the same time, they
have to take a semester off,"
Zuckerman said. "I think people
will really appreciate if we can
give them that opportunity."
According to Canning,
WolvPAC originally anticipated
negative feedback from the stu-
dent body that could potentially
cloud the organization's efforts.
"We expected to get some
negative feedback about this
effort because often people try
to politicize things involving
Israel," Canning wrote. "Luck-
ily, we've only received positive
feedback because I think we've
made it clear that the issue has
nothing to do with identity or
politics, but simply educational
opportunities."
Sherbill also wrote that the
issue affects all students, not
only those who identify with the
Jewish religion.
"At first, students think that
this is only a 'Jewish' issue,"
Sherbill wrote. "The reality is
that this program would benefit
all Michigan students because
Israel has some of the best uni-
versities in the world and a

"We, as a legislative body,
are responsible for ensuring
that this is the correct budget,"
Friedman said. "We are looking
at a budget that could have any-
thing in it."
The Compiled Code also
requires the treasurer to hold
an open meeting to discuss the
budgetatleastseven daysbefore
it's presented to the assembly.
Sayed neglected to hold such a
meeting last week.
Raymond said he didn't know
why Sayed didn't hold the meet-
ing.
"I can't necessarily speak
for (Sayed) in terms of why she
was unable to meet with the
Finance Committee this week,"
Raymond said. "I think she defi-
nitely should have."
In an interview after the

meeting, Eral said that since
MSA is still transitioning to
the new Compiled Code, the
a meeting with the treasurer
wasn't "required" in order to be
in compliance with the code.
Additionally, because the
budget resolution was writ-
ten only by Sayed - without an
MSA representative co-author
- it can't be adopted according
to the MSA Constitution
MSA's Finance Commit-
tee will work with Sayed this
week to finalize a budget to be
approved at next week's MSA
meeting, according to Eral.
"I think the budget needed
to be postponed because it was
incomplete," Eral said.

LIGHITNG
From Page 1A
robbery in December involving
students in a sorority and this
month an armed robbery involv-
ing a student in a fraternity.
The most common concern
among students at the forum was
the lack of lighting in Oxbridge
Neighborhood- the area south-
west of campus where the crimes
took place.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community relations,
spoke extensively on the issue of
lighting and made it clear that
there is no quick fix to the prob-
lem.
"For us to pursue additional
lighting is not as simple and will
not be as simple as submitting a
petition, getting a couple of dol-
lars to put up some poles, putsome

lights in them and flip the switch,"
he said.
According to Kosteva, the city
of Ann Arbor has had a moratori-
um on the installation of any addi-
tional street lights in the city for
the past five to seven years.
"The reasons for this are direct-
ly financial," Kosteva said. "Street
lights are paid for by all the tax-
payers inAnn Arbor, so just as you
get an individual lighting bill at
home, the city... gets a single light-
ing bill for the thousands if not
tens of thousands of street lights
that are across the community."
Kosteva said it would cost the
city anywhere from $3,000 to
$5,000 to install new lights, but
the real problem emerges with the
long-term cost of operation.
One possible solution to the
lighting issue, Kosteva said, could
be to make the Oxbridge Neigh-
borhood a "special assessment

district."
According to Kosteva, this
type of district would have clear
boundaries around it, and individ-
uals living in the area would have
to pay a tax for an additional ser-
vice - in this case, lighting.
The DPS and AAPD officers on
the panel agreed that while street
lighting is an issue, it isn't easy to
solve. They advocated that stu-
dents use other resources avail-
able to them to ensure their safety.
The officers told students to
call DPS any time, to know where
the "Blue Light" telephones are
located on campus and to use the
shared-ride taxi service that is
free for University-affiliated indi-
viduals. They also urged students
to walk in groups and always let
someone know when and where
they're walking.
Lt. Mark St. Amour of the
AAPD said students are often easy

victims in crimes.
"Ann Arbor is a very safe town,
but (with) most home invasions,
it's an unlocked door, an unlocked
window," St. Amour said.
He added that alcohol con-
sumption often multiplies a per-
son's risk of being a victim of
certain crimes.
"Sexual assaults - alot of them
that I read- involve alcohol, so
females, watch your alcohol," St.
Amour said. "The odds of you
becoming a victim go up as the
alcohol is ingested during the
night. Two in the morning, three
in the morning, when the bars get
out, that's a prime opportunity."
In an interview last night, two
members of Delta Phi Epsilon - a
sorority located in the Oxbridge
neighborhood - said they take
cautionary measures before walk-
ing in the area at night.
LSA sophomore Julie Sher-

bill said that instead of walking
around the neighborhood, she
tries to take advantage of the Uni-
versity's Safe Ride as frequently
as possible. When Sherbill has to
walk at night, though, she said she
makes sure she's never alone.
"I always make sure I have a
buddy," Sherbill said.
LSA sophomore Allison Sher-
man said she happened to be
walking alone to her sorority
about the same time the Decem-
ber armed robbery took place. She
said the thought of how close she
was to the robbery made her ques-
tion how safe she was.
"That was definitely a wake-up
call," Sherman said. "Now every
single time I'm walking home I get
really freaked out when I see a car
or person in the distance."

Cinti contributed to this report.

the (United States)."
LSA freshman Laura
Katsnelson, a WolvPAC mem-
ber, expressed similar frus-
tration with the University
failing to offer undergradu-
ates a chance to study abroad
in Israel.
"As a freshman at the Uni-
versity, Iwas surprised whenI
realized that we don't have an
official study abroad program
to Israel," Katsnelson wrote in
an e-mail. "For me and a lot of
classmates, Israel is a definite

Sundance shorts shine

The Michigan puts on
new shorts as part of
Park City's festival
By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
It's easy to lose sight of what the Sun-
dance Film Festival is all about in the
midst of all the fur vests and celebrities
who flock to Salt Lake
City in the wintertime.
But somewhere in those Sundance
hoards of people, the $hots 2010
spirit and potential of
the independent film Atthe
still reigns. The short Michigan
films for the 2011 Fes- Today at 9:30 p.m.
tival have managed to
capture that spirit for
the most part and blend both tragedy and
comedy from a diverse range of cultural
backgrounds.
The first film in the eight-film series
is "The Six Dollar Fifty Man." It tells the
story of a boy who creates a fantasy world
in order to escape bullies at school, as well
as the drone of ordinary life. While cer-
tainly awell-made film, the child actors in
"The Six Dollar Fifty Man" can't hold up
against the vibrant characters portrayed

by more mature actors in other films.
"Birthday" and "Rob and Valentyna
in Scotland" both deal with complex
love relationships between adults in a
harsh reality. The performances of the
actors (particularly Kimi Reichenberg
as Valentyna) infuse their cinematically
striking yet painful worlds with delicate
and often tender emotions. Both films
attempt to tackle challenging and con-
troversial subject matter. "Birthday" is
a Polish film about a lesbian couple and
the strain their relationship undergoes
as they create a family. "Rob and Valen-
tyna in Scotland" is perhaps the most
contentious of the short films as it tells
the story of a somewhat incestuous love
story betweentwo cousins.
The most vibrant of the films is "Mr.
Okra," a documentary about a man who
sells fruits and vegetables from his truck
in New Orleans. Though simple, "Mr.
Okra" successfully captures the per-
sonality of both the man and his city as
he cruises through the streets, singing
about his vegetables and philosophizing
about life.
However, "Mr. Okra" isn't the only
splash of color and lightheartedness.
In fact, the vast majority of these films
attempt to put a lighthearted spin on
matters. "Young Love" is precisely what
its title suggests - a satirical musing on

a relationship - but it's got the added
bonus of having llamas in it. "My Invis-
ible Friend" is actually a very sad story
about isolation and a boy who is too shy
to even ask his own father to pass him
the salt at the dinner table. But director
Pablo Larcuen infuses it with warmth
- and a half-naked man in an Admiral
Ackbar mask. There's also "My Rabbit
Hobby," shot in home-video style that
almost twists into a mockingly terrible
horror movie.
But by far the funniest of the films is
"Drunk History," where booze-infused
comedian Jen Kirkman tells the story
of Frederick Douglass (Don Cheadle,
"Brooklyn's Finest") and Abraham Lin-
coln (Will Ferrell, "The Other Guys").
Though it's part of the website Funny
or Die's "Drunk History" series, the film
could be interpreted as an interesting
take on the way historical narratives can
be manipulated.
There is one animation in the short
film series, called "Wisdom Teeth."
Basically, it's one cartoon guy pulling
out another's wisdom teeth stitches
with calamitous results. It's bizarre and
kind of grotesque, but at the same time,
it's hard to avoid an occasional burst of
laughter - whether that laughter results
from discomfort or some kernel of humor
is hard to discern.

Destroyer breaks
ground on albu-m

'The Way Back'a step ahead

By IMRAN SYED
Daily Arts Writer
A 4,000-mile walk sure is impressive,
but does it make for a good movie? "The
Way Back" - a beautiful story of Soviet
prisoners who walk
all the way from
Siberia through bit-
ter cold and unfor- The Way Back
giving desert toward
India and freedom At Rave
- shows that the Newmarket
answer is yes.
Based on the book
"The Long Walk," the film is an allegedly
true account - "allegedly" because ques-
tions about the authenticity of the story
have swirled since the book was first pub-
lished more than 50 years ago. Seemingly
confirmed as a fabrication at one point,
"The Long Walk" was recently redeemed
when a former Polish POW living in Eng-
land revealed the account was true, and
thathe in fact was amongthose who made
the journey from Siberia to India.
Truthiness aside, the film is an admi-
rable production that manages to convey
the heartbreaking reality of its charac-
ters' lives without going overboard on
sentiment or theatrics.
Political prisoners being worked to
death in hellish labor camps in the far
reaches of Siberia, eight men hatch a plot
to escape. But breaching the barbed wire
fence is just the first of their challenges:
They must then walk thousands of miles
through blinding snowstorms and frigid
temperatures unimaginable to anyone
who hasn't been to Siberia - all without
adequate food to sustain them.

Daily Arts Writer
Destroyerisunpredictable. FromThe
New Pornos' pop to Dan Bejar's work
as a solo artist, which flirts with and
disregards indie pre-
dilections with a sort
of chaotic panache,*
Bejar's music is like De r
the lemon perched on
your glass of water at Kaputt
a new restaurant. You M
didn't know, ask for Merge
or expect it. And it's a
little fruity.
Kaputt is Destroyer's ninth and fruiti-
est LP yet. Following 2009's Bay of Pigs
and 2010's Archer on the Beach EP's
ambient diary-turned-disco, Kaputt
flaunts sultry saxophone, funky fretless
bass and 4/4 beats without irony. Acous-
tic guitars and keyboards give way to
muted trumpets and flute, smoothly gaz-
ing two-chords-and-reverb - Kenny G
was cool.
It may not be the
new pornography,
but 'Kaputt' rocks.
Chillwave this is not. Bejar's paint-
ing in hip colors with Kaputt, but he
transcends gimmick. "Chinatown"
and "Kaputt," two of his most acces-
sible tunes ever, don't hide behind gauze;
they're not afraid of every piece, note and
riff standing in spit-shine spotlight. Fel-
low Vancouverite Sibel Thrasher plays
back-up vocalistloBejar's sexy, theatri-
cal free-verse, and she's really singing
- chilly white-soul like D.D. Jackson or
any number of disco divas lost in time.
So while Destroyer's Bowie-Bryan
Ferry-Coke-Gil Evans-Lindstrom make-

over is cool, it's looking forward. Here,
Bejar's melodies are given the space
and groove his older work seldom had.
Where manic-pop used to be, deliber-
ate, widescreen-but-intimate jams have
moved in, with room to breathe.
And where past Destroyer had Bejar
breathing heavy, here he's relaxed. His
voice, which for some may be a hur-
dle (get over it), resembles something
between a French Revolution re-enactor
and pillow talk. On Kaputt, he forgoes
his old verbosity for impressionism.
But like the best disco, the voice is
more than just another instrument.
Destroyer's lyrics have often been a
sort of catch-all abstraction, capable
of disorientation and directness all at
once. Kaputt gives those words a new
space, a looser but definite focus. In a
recent interview, Bejar claimed to have
recorded most of the vocals "while fix-
ing ... a sandwich," which sounds about
right. Pair it with a couple of gin and ton-
ics, Thrasher's pipes and arguably the
real vocalist of the album - JP Carter's
trumpet solos -Kaputt has plenty to say.
But dissecting the lyrics would need
another review. Overall, the music
speaks for itself. "Blue Eyes" gazes,
grooves and rips in equal measure.
"Savage Night at the Opera" rides out
a New Order bass pump, unafraid of a
nasty little guitar solo to cry all over
the songs' new-age climb. The title
track and "Suicide Demo For Kara
Walker" are perfect songs for looking
out of car windows, airplane windows,
getting fucked up. And if all of Kaputt
sounds samey to you, you're right. But
it's like a 50-minute tone-poem with
enough detail, purpose and sprawl to
make every listen different. By the time
you get to the album-closing "Bay of
Pigs," you've been places.
So, Destroyer's breaking ground
and it's transportative stuff. It's not
for everyone, which is fine. Unpredict-
able as ever, Kaputt makes it clear that
Destroyer is anything but normal.

"This way to the Shire!"
After overcoming impossible odds to
get out of the tundra and over the Soviet
line, the prisoners learn that Mongolia
is also under communist control, and
they won't be truly safe until they walk
through to China. They brave the Gobi
Dessert, and then traverse the Himalayas
before entering British India to complete
their stunning journey to freedom.
Parts of the film are in Russian (with
subtitles), but the majority is in accented
English. Nevertheless, audiences won't
feel inclined to question its authentic-
ity. Benefiting from a talented cast -
including Hollywood regulars Ed Harris
("Appaloosa"), Jim Sturgess ("21"), Sao-
irse Ronan ("The Lovely Bones") and
Colin Farrell ("In Bruges"), in addition
to lesser-known American and foreign
actors - the film manages to keep its epic
story on a fathomable scale for its viewers.
Never does it get lost in its own grandeur,
and that is more than can be said for most
Hollywood productions.
There are, of course, moments of agony
for the escapees, and several of them die

excruciating deaths along the way. The
suffering is immense, but portrayed on
the small scale and thus kept very person-
al - most readily reminiscent of the hours
spent under the rubble in Oliver Stone's
"World Trade Center."
Hollywood's finest
shipped to Siberia.
Audiences may not exactly leap at the
prospectof 133 minutesofpain and agony,
but "The Way Back" presents its tragedy
in a way that understands the limits of a
viewer. Director Peter Weir could have
presented much more graphic material
and defended it as authentic. He chose
instead to lighten an impossibly sad story
with humor and personality. The result is
a film that is perhaps far more watchable
than something this inhumane should be.

New season of 'Archer'
sharpens its humor

NBC's 'Couples' perfectly boring

By JAMIE BLOCK
Daily Arts Writer
What happens when a couple of
comedic actresses with moderate cult
followings join a bunch of wayward,
relative unknowns
for a campy couples
series that none
of them seem to Perfect Couples
belong in? Nothing
good. Nothing at Pilot
all, really.
Even from it's Thursdays at 8:30 p.m.
name, "Perfect NBC
Couples" seems
like an ill-advised choice for NBC to
throw into its now three-hour Thursday
comedy block. This isn't clever, oddball
ensemble comedy. This is derivative
dysfunctional-couple humor that's been
done a bajillion times before, and often
better. Sometimes it's not even clear
where the jokes are in "Perfect Couples"
- and when one is detectable, it's just
not funny.
First of all, what the hell is Olivia
Munn, geek goddess of former G4 fame
and recent correspondent on "The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart," doing in a ter-
rible romantic comedy like this? She
should be surrounded by cosplay, lasers,
irony and gadgets, not stale lines about
how great her husband is. To make mat-

ters worse, Munn's acting in "Couples"
is pretty awful. She can't get away with
looking like she's trying to be funny any-
more. This isn't "Attack of the Show," and
she doesn't fit here.
Equally strange to find in this campy
crap is Mary Elizabeth Ellis ("It's Always
Sunny in Philadelphia"). She's great at
acting bitchy, and that's what makes her
character so enjoyable on "Sunny." And
while there's something simply off about
watching Ellis in a couple that's sup-
posed to be at least partially functional,
she's still the only actor on "Couples"
who makes the character seem believ-
able in the real world.
Comedy night
done wrong.
Her competition isn't particularly
strong, though. Worst of all is Hayes
MacArthur ("Worst Week"), who always
sounds like he's reading lines off a script
- in the sixth grade. His inflection is all
wrong, his timing is terrible and he can't
even pronounce "jewelry." This is not the
guy who should be playing the worldly
hot-shot, even if that hot-shot is sup-
posed to be kind of a douche.

Then there's David Walton ("Heist"),
who always seems to be on drugs or from
another planet. The character is written
to be a ridiculous caricature of the slov-
enly, weird dude, and Walton's deadpan
delivery only serves to make it unclear
whether he's even supposed to be funny.
Rounding out the cast are Kyle Born-
heimer ("Worst Week") and Christine
Woods ("FlashForward"), who both
manage to look eerily familiar without
having been featured in anything anyone
watched. While they don't suck as much
as MacArthur and Walton, they give
depressingly one-note performances of
the awkward goofball and hyper-sensi-
tive working wife, respectively.
What really sums up "Perfect Cou-
ples" is the feeling you have after watch-
ing it - or rather, the fact that you won't
feel anything at all, or even be sure
you really did watch it. You won't have
laughed, it'll be hard to remember what
the stories were and you probably won't
remember any of the characters' names,
but the clock will still show half an hour
later than it did when you sat down to
watch NBC's brand new comedy. It's
the best possible physical manifestation
of the Platonic idea of a waste of time.
"Perfect Couples" doesn't amuse, enter-
tain, enrage or annoy. It just happens,
and that's one of the worst things a TV
show can do.

By JAMIE BLOCK
DailyArts Writer
After far too long a break, Sterling
Archer is back in the danger zone. The
writers of FX's breakout animated
comedy "Archer"
put their off-time to
good use, crafting a *
second season that, Archer
if its premiere is any
indication, focuses Season Two
on what worked best Premiere
in last year's batch of
episodes. Thursdays at10 p.m.
Right off the bat, FX
that means much
more back-and-forth between Archer
(H. Jon Benjamin, "Important Things
with Demetri Martin") and Lana
(Aisha Tyler, "Ghost Whisperer").
Their swift transitions between per-
fect spy team and dysfunctional couple
are more hilarious than ever, and their
banter is perfectly paced to maximize
laughs. While there may be funnier
individual characters on other shows,
there's no couple on TV right now that
comes close to matching Archer and
Lana's tag-team hilarity.
The refined second season also
means more cultural references cour-
tesy of our dynamic duo. Returning are
Archer's constant self-comparisons to
action heroes, joined by less-expect-
ed cultural nods to "The Lorax" or
"Where the Red Fern Grows." And as
always, "Archer" trusts its audience to
be smart, slipping references into the
middle of conversations without mak-
ing it too obvious. Not only does getting
the reference make viewers laugh, it

also makes them feel smart.
Sadly, "Archer" can't just be the
Archer and Lana show. The rest of
the cast is greatly marginalized in
the season premiere, but even the few
scenes in which they appear just don't
pack much of a comedic punch. While
putting Archer and Lana together is
always a great idea, putting them away
from everyone else leaves the rest of
the cast flailing without a solid come-
dic anchor.
If any other complaint could be
made, it's that the season premiere's
storyline was the show's most anti-cli-
mactic to date. But while the lack of a
shootout ending was a bit of a letdown,
the fact that Archer and Lana went
through explosions, alligators, dry ice
injuries and putting up with each other,
all for nothing, is probably the most fit-
ting possible way to sum up their whole
schtick.
Call Kenny
Loggins: 'Archer'
has returned.
"Archer" is one of the most intel-
ligent comedies currently around. It's
written by smart people, for smart peo-
ple and about smart people (who hap-
pen to do ridiculously dumb things).
And with a second season promising
humor that is more self-referential,
pop cultural and socially unacceptable,
it's only getting smarter from here.

ICE HOCKEY
'M' can't get complacent

Blue struggles against zones

t this time last year,
nearly 20 games into the
CCHA season, the Mich-
igan hockey team had its boxing
gloves on. Michigan was in the
ring, knowing
it needed to CASANDRA
knock out any PAGNI
opponent in
its way just to On Ice Hockey
have a chance
at the postseason. The Wolver-
ines were seventh in the CCHA,
and that's only because they grit-
ted out four conference wins in
its first six games in 2010.
Michigan held a 9-8-1 CCHA
record when it headed into its 19th
game of the season against the
Spartans in late January last year.
We all know the Wolverines'
incredible story of last year's
improbable postseason run, but
we also know the agonythat came
along with Miami (Ohio)'s 3-2
double-overtime winto move onto
the Frozen Four. But it's 20i1 -
and this Michigansquad just won
its 14th conference game.
This year's Wolverines are
ranked sixth in the nation.
Michigan sits atop the CCHA
and looks poised to receive a con-
ference tournament first-round
bye and an NCAA Tournament
berth, barringsome major train
wreck in the remaining nine
games.
This year's Wolverines are
good, so the odds of that train-
wreck happening is aboutas
likely as Tate Forcier declaring a
major in Organic Chemistry at his
next school, but in its remaining
nine games, Michigan can still
get better. And for it to do so, the
Wolverines need to dig back into
their closets and dust off those old
boxing gloves.
To avoid a second helping of
that bitter taste thatthe loss to the
RedHawks gave the Wolverines
in Fort Wayne last year, this year's
squad can't getcomplacent.

Daily Sports Writer
In the first half of the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's game
against No. 15 Minnesota on Sat-
urday, the Wolverines scored just
four points in the paint.
That statistic itself wasn't ter-
ribly eye-popping. Michigan has
four shooters on the court at all
times - four players that hang on
the perimeter while their lonely
fifth man often gets smothered
under the basket. And if they can't
get penetration, they're all happy
to fire shots from beyond the arc.
But Michigan coach John
Beilein knows that four points in
the paint are too few and the 19
first-half 3-point shots the Wol-
verines took against the Golden
Gophers were too many. He's
probably aware that even a team
of five Glen Rices - Michigan's
all-time leader in 3-pointfield goal
percentage - wouldn't be able
to successfully run such a one-
dimensional offense.
What was particularly interest-
ing, though, was how Minnesota
turned the Wolverines (1-6 Big
Ten, 11-9 overall) from a shoot-
first offense to a shooting-only
offense.
Minnesota coach Tubby Smith
deployed a 2-3 zone for most of the
game, which apparently caught
Beilein off guard because Michi-
gan looked as though it had no
idea how to attack it.
And instead of attacking it, the
Wolverines sat back and put up the
most 3-point attempts they have
all season (35).
"They went to a zone - people
hadn't zoned us for a month,"
Beilein said in his weekly radio
show on Monday. "It gave us a few
issues before halftime. We closed
the half very poorly - let them
back in ita little bit - and then we
opened the (second) half poorly
and got down."
Typically, zone defenses are
used to crowding the lane so

*1

Junior guard Zack Novak was one of the few bright spots against Minnesota.

opposing forwards can't get open
underneath Teams usually stick
to man-to-man against Michigan
because zones consistently leave
men open around the perimeter.
And against a team of shooters
like the Wolverines, opponents
are wary about allowing them to
fire threes all game.
But Smith wasn't concerned.
With a long team that features
elite big men like Trevor Mbakwe,
Colton Iverson and Ralph Samp-
son - at times all on the court at
once - Minnesota was able to
stretch its zone out to the perim-
eter and still clog up the lane, cre-
ating a menacing wall of defense
for sophomore pointguard Darius
Morris to dealwith.
"They made 12 (3-pointers) -
they made 12 too many," Smith
said. "We challenged some shots
well, but they're most effective
when they're penetrating a pitch-
ing. But because the zone didn't
really allow them to beatus off the
dribble and find people open, the
zone was very effective."
The plan worked to perfec-
tion, much like how Syracuse's
zone worked against Michigan at

the Legend's Classic in Novem-
ber, when the Wolverines shot
at a woeful 8-for-32 clip from
3-point territory. Both the Golden
Gophers and the Orange were able
to close off drives and still stretch
the zone enough to get a hand in
the shooters' faces.
About five minutes into the sec-
ond half, Novak put up a 3-pointer
from the corner, only to get stuffed
by the high-flying Mbakwe, who
retreated from the low post to
make the play.
"With that length, it's similar to
a Syracuse zone that you just have
trouble when you get it into spots
and you turn and there's a 7-footer
standingthere,"Beilein said after the
game."Those guys are flying at you."
Normally, Michigan won't have
to worry about facinga zone with
length like Minnesota or Syracuse
because most teams just aren't big
enough to run it and still cover
shooters on the perimeter. But
Beilein probably still hopes he
doesn't see a zone again for awhile.
And he probably won't - not
until he treks to Minneapolis in
late February to face Smith's crew
again.

A DANGEROUS LUST
AN ABUSIVE ENCOUNTER
LEADS TO SELF DISCOVER
BY ALLYSON SAMFILIPPO

few years ago, I was madly
in lust with my abuser.
*Barry was 5'10" and tow-
ered over me like a sneering gar-
goyle. My ignorance nourished his
caustic disrespect as our mutual
antagonism evolved into palpable
abuse. Our arguments excited me,
and his slaps reinforced my suspi-
cion that anon-jerk simply wouldn't
satisfy my "needs."
One day, in his mother's dingy
apartment, one of our verbal quar-
rels erupted into our last physi-
cal struggle. I was sitting opposite
him on a barf-green faux-velvet
sofa chair. My thighs sunk into the
cheap cushion. Barry was drum-
ming the fingers of his left hand
on the coffee table, hunched over
the Marlboro Red he was twirling.
The ashes fell haphazardly onto the
table I could imagine his mother
polishing hours earlier. Tomorrow,
she would tut, clicking her tongue
against her teeth and shaking her
blonde curls, as she cleaned up after
her freeloadingson. I scowled.
"'What?" he smiled contemptu-
ously.
"You can't use the ashtray?"
He puffed the cigarette, held in
the smoke and exhaled through his
yellow Chiclet-sized teeth before
stubbing it out and rising to his feet,
still smirking.
"Nope."
I rose to my feet so that my nose
was level with his neck. I was not
looking into his eyes. I usually
didn't. Barry brought his middle
and pointer fingers to the soft
spot right below my collarbone

THEJUNyKDtRAWyERs
random student interview by teddy papes

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
betweenjournalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred. Hello there!
What's your name?
Brianne.
What's the first word that
comes to mind when you think
of the Business School?
Um, awesome?
Same with me. What's the first
word that comes to mind when
you think of The Michigan
Daily?
Paper?
What would you say the worst
part about the University is?
Well I live on North Campus so I
have to take the bus everyday...'
Do you think it's especially cold
up there, or do you get the same
weather as us?
I think it has the same weather as
central.
What do you think of video
games?
Video games are cool.
Someone once said video games

are the art of the possible. Do
you agree?
Art of the possible? Yeah, I guess...
What do you think about the IM
soccer rule where girls get two
points for a goal?
I think it's fair because guys are
faster than girls.
Do you have a positive opinion
of affirmative action?
Yeah, I guess.
Or is it strictly soccer related?
It's situational.
OK, but soccer definitely?
Yeah.
What about a female presiden-
tial candidate? Should she get
bonus electoral votes?
No.
What do you think about peo-
ple who don't wash their hands
after they use the bathroom?
Gross.
People say hands are the dirti-
est part of your body. Shouldn't
you wash your body after your
hands touch it, not the other
way around?
Um ... no. You touch your hands to
your face and that's how you get

sick, you don't really touch your
face to other parts of your body.
What is the difference between
humans and animals, besides
that some humans wash their
hands after using the bath-
room?
Imagination and ingenuity.
It's actually a trick question:
humans are animals. Based
on this fact, would you say it's
wrong to eat meat?
That's a biased question.
Well feel free to answer it how-
ever you want.
I eat meat. I guess humans are
technically animals but they're ...
different.
How many goals, would you
say, an antelope should get if it
scores a goal?
A what?
An antelope: four-legged,
Simba eats them in "The Lion
King"?
A lot, they get like 20 points.
Are you a football fan?
Yes.
Does Lebron actually think
Ohio sucks?

Probably not.
Do you think Mark Sanchez
actually picked his nose and
wiped it on a fellow teammate?
No.
Did you see that video? Do you
know what I'm talking about?
No, I haven't seen that video.
You should Google it. Do you
have an opinion on the new
7-Eleven on campus?
I haven't been there yet, but I got
to 7-Eleven alot back home.
Is the reason you go there to
study?
No.
You know they are putting a
study lounge in the 7-Eleven?.
I was unaware of that.
So what is your main draw to
7-Eleven?
Slurpee.
Slurpee. Will you end up study-
ing there or bring it to the
library after you get it?
Yeah, I probably won't study there.
One more question, do you
know who Will Grundler is?
No.
Terrific.

invitations.
During the next couple years, Smith
said there are no plans for further
expansion in Panhel, mostly because of
the lack of housing.
"It's really difficult to find houses,"
she said. "We're also pretty comfort-
able with our numbers right now. If our
chapters start getting a little bigger, and
we feel the need for another chapter to
come in to put some of the membership
weight on them, then that's what we'll
do in the future."
Schmidt said because Zeta and
AEPhi have completed all the steps in
the returning process, all the Panhel
chapters are now "viewed as equals."
Smith said there is not a downside
to joining a sorority that has recently
returned versus one that has been on
campus for a long time.
"They do the same things as the rest
of us," she said. "There is an appeal to
new sororities in the sense that they're
your chance to really make an impact
on your organization. You really have
a say on the direction that your group
goes since everybody is new and you
don't have old chapter members that
have been there forever."
However, Smith said others might be
less inclined to joina returning chapter
because the process during the first few
months is not ironed out since the orga-
nization is still "adjusting to things."
Smith added that all chapters in Pan-
hel have the organization's full support.
"It's not like these groups are just
new sororities that spring up out of the
dirt," she said. "They still have a rich
history like all sororities and have sym-
bols and traditions that they share, as
well as a great amount of support from
their national organization."
Despite potential competition when
seeking new members, Smith said
existing chapters on campus are happy
when other chapters return.
"I don't think other houses feel
threatened really by other sororities
coming back because we already have
a lot of us," she said. "So we are happy
with our own chapters, we've become
members there and we are happy to see
others succeed."
McAvoy said one of the best parts
of joining a chapter that has newly
returned, such as AEPhi or Zeta, in its
first year is the age variety of the join-
ing members.
"They have seniors, juniors, sopho-
mores and freshmen," she said. "While
the house may be new, there are so
many different types of girls that are

joining. Since they'd only have one
pledge class, it puts everyone on a more
equal playing ground."
Smith said it's exciting when new
chapters join the community.
"Obviously we feel a sense of connec-
tion with our sisters and our groups, but
I think there is a bond that exists with
all Panhellenic women and all Greeks,"
she said. "The more members that we
have, the more opportunities we have
to make friends and make connec-
tions."
Additions to the
Interfraternity Council
Haughee said in the six years he has
worked at the Office of Greek Life, there
has been an expansion in IFC every
semester. This is due to the increase
of fraternities nationwide and a more
comprehensive procedure for chapters
that return or start on campus.
According to Haughee, there are
three main ways chapters join the IFC:
National organizations spearhead the
expansion, groups of students reach
out to national and local organizations
to seek help in starting a chapter or
a small group outside IFC chooses to
enter the council.
Beta Theta Pi fraternity is one chap-
ter that returned due to a push from
nationals last fall. According to Haugh-
ee, the national organization made
the decision for Beta to both leave and
return to the University and has been
supporting the chapter through each
step. Haughee added that a key role in
Beta's success could be attributed to
the constant involvement of its national
organization and alumni board.
"A cohesive unified group of alumni
can make a big difference," he said.
Sean Jackson, LSA sophomore and
IFC vice president of public relations,
said Beta has been successful in its
return to campus thus far.
Haughee said Pi Lambda Phi frater-
nity is the perfect example of a group
lookingto begin a chapter.
"In the fall of 2005, 18 men who did
not find their comfort zone with the
existing chapters got together and said
'Hey, let's do our own thing,' " he said.
"They researched and found their com-
fort level in Pi Lambda Phi and came
to the office saying they had a group of
guys that want to start a fraternity and
have already spoken with the national
organization."
Haughee said Theta Delta Chi frater-
nity - which existed as a small group,

but decided to become part of the coun-
cil in 2010 - exemplifies a chapter's
wish to joina council.
LSA junior and IFC President Jared
Jaffe said the most challenging aspect
of returning IFC chapters is trying to
rush new members. Existing chapters
have the necessary experience, while
new chapters have to play catch up.
"They have to try to figure out every-
thing when everyone else already has it
figured out," he said.
Jackson said working with the chap-
ter's national organization is a great
way to assist and facilitate the new
chapter's return.
As with the sororities, Jaffe said one
of the main appeals to interested mem-
bers in joining a newly-returned IFC
chapter is the possibility of becoming
a founding member and making the
chapter unique.
"Every house has something specific
to it," he said. "If you are a freshmen,
instead of joining something that has
its own identity and being formed by
it, you get to use whatever you are as a
person to make the house be what you
want."
Jaffe said his fraternity, Pi Kappa
Alpha, is known on campus for being
into sports and Triangle fraternity
has a large interest in engineering. By
joining a new chapter, the members
wouldn't finda place where they fit, but
rather create a place of their own.
Jackson said having new chapters
return to campus doesn't cause compe-
tition with the existing fraternities, but
rather creates incentives for students
to join the Greek community because
it provides another option for them to
pick from.
Jaffe added that though no compe-
tition exists in the newly formed or
returning "little guys," there is always
a bit of competition among the pre-
existing fraternities that serve as the
"heads" of the Greek community.
An undercurrent of competition
exists in many aspects of Greek Life,
Haughee said. He explained that a few
years ago, the competition among IFC
chapters was much more apparent,
but it has now died down due to the
reformed structure in its expansion
process.
"If we were having this conversation
four or five years ago there would be a
much larger sense of competition with
the new chapters and the existing chap-
ters that isn't there now because of the
structured growth IFC went under," he
said.

The Rise
and Fall
of Greek
Chapters

Similar to fashion trends, sorority and
fraternity chapters cycle in and out of
campus communities across the nation
each year. Greek Life representatives say
that the desirability of the University's
Greek system puts it on the upward end
of the cycle and draws more chapters to
Ann Arbor.
Despite the popularity of sorori-
ties and fraternities on campus, it's not
uncommon for chapters to leave and
return after a few years. Throughout the
past five years, two Panhellenic Associa-
tion sororities - Alpha Epsilon Phi and
Zeta Tau Alpha - and eight Interfrater-
nity Council fraternities - Pi Lambda
Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Pi, Sigma
Chi, Alpha Tau Omega, Theta Delta Chi,
Tau Kappa Epsilon and Beta Theta Pi -
have returned to campus after brief dis-
memberments.
Sororities AEPhi and Zeta returned to
the University Greek system in 2008 and
2009 respectively, accordingto assistant
director of Greek Life Chris Haughee.
Over the past few years, Haughee said
there has "definitely (been) a growth in
both number of members and number of
chapters."
The return of the IFC fraternities
spans from 2005 to today. Pi Lamda Phi
returned in 2005, followed Delta Tau
Delta and Sigma Pi in 2006, Sigma Chi in
2008, Alpha Tau Omega in 2009. Theta
Delta Chi returned to campus in 2008
and rejoined IFC in 2010, Tau Kappa
Epsilon returned in 2009 and Beta Theta
Pi returned in 2010. This fall, Acacia fra-
ternity will also return to campus.
LSA junior and Panhellenic Society
Vice President of Public Relations Sarah
Smith, who is also a Michigan Daily col-
umnist, said the Greek community at the
University is growing with each passing
year.
"We're doing more," Smith said. "Not
only are we getting more new members,
but our councils are becoming more
active with events, programming and
philanthropy. It's a great time to be a
Michigan Greek."
This year, the University accepted its
largest freshman class ever. Compared
to previous freshman classes, Smith said
more of them decided to joina fraternity
or sorority and "go Greek."
Dissolving a
chapter
Most fraternities and sororities on
campus are part ofalarger nationalorga-
nization and must adhere to the policies
and procedures set up by that group.

Haughee said the decision for a Greek
letter organization to leave campus usu-
ally roots from risk management issues
and the national organization's decision
to remove the chapter. It's generally not
up to the University to determine which
chapters can stay on campus.
Smith said it's not that something is
"fundamentally wrong" with a chapter
that makes them leave and come back,
but rather a desire to start over.
Haughee clarified that the two coun-
cils - Panhel and IFC - ultimately,
determine whether or not a chapter
exists in its organization, but the nation-
al organization dictates if the chapter
"It's like a franchise like McDonalds
or Starbucks," he said. "You have a lot
of McDonalds all over the country, and
all over the world some of them are a lot
better than others. Now applying that to
fraternity and sorority life, sometimes
the quality isn't there so the franchise
chooses to shut it down and reopen it
with a potentially new owner. It works
the same way."

come back," she said.
Smith echoed this sentiment, saying
a chapter may have a certain reputation
when its founded, but five years later, it
can be completely different.
"They could recruit different men or
women," she said. "They could start to
abide by or not abide by policies. It total-
ly depends on the group of people in the
organization. I don't think they are con-
cerned about looking better or coming
back with a better image because that
image can change."
Smith said chapters that return are
often motivated to join the local coun-
cils rather than existing outside of them.
The benefits of being a member include
recruitment assistance, participation in
Greek Week and protection and assis-
tance.-
"There's also a sense of community
that comes with being a partofit,",Smith
said.

has remained devoted to the sport, traveling
to almost every college football stadium and
witnessing big games with his friends. These
experiences, as well as the sports culture in
Ann Arbor, make the University of Michigan
the right place for Concha.
"I really feel that a college life anywhere
else in the world wouldn't give me the oppor-
tunity to experience all these things in the
same place," he said.
Though Concha has adjusted to life inAnn
Arbor and has made friends easily, he said he
still maintains a large group of close friends
who are from Latin America.
Other cultural practices he continues
include drinking scotch - the beverage of
choice forEcuadorianmen - and asearchfor
healthy foods, a task Concha said is almost
impossible when navigating the campus eat-
eries.
Though Concha ultimately plans to return
to Ecuador, he says he has enjoyed his col-
lege experience and plans to maximize the
remainder of it.
"As much I love my home, I love this place
too ... I'm enjoying it very much, and I never
regret a single moment coming here," he said.
PAKISTAN
Comparing his recent North American
experience to a childhood in Pakistan, Engi-
neering junior Abran Khalid notes one large
difference that to some may seem trivial:
light.
Khalid spent his childhood in Lahore, Pak-
istan - the second largest city in the country
- where electric light was sometimes pre-
cious due to occasional outages. He lived in
a busy neighborhood with narrow alleys and
bazaars he described as akin to scenes from a
Bollywood movie.
Completing the city's vibrant picture,
Khalid described games of cricket played
on the streets. Kites were often seen in the
air, with children gluing powdered glass to
kite strings for the popular, yet currently
banned, sport of kite fighting. The resulting
cuts on participants' hands and fingers from
tightly holdingthe string were the reward for
knocking another kite out of the air.

As Khalid explained, life in the city
revolved around food, with shops opening
at 5:30 a.m. to meet the demands of the hun-
dreds of people waiting in line to be served.
Inside, a shopkeeper would diligently make
lassi, a drink made from yogurt and water,
with their hands.
As a teenager, Khalid moved from the city
streets to suburbia. Though the scenery was
beautiful, Khalid said there were no more
cricket games or kites flown in the air. And
though suburbia included large lawns and
expensive cars, it was far removed from the
numbers of children and adults living in pov-
erty who Khalid became accustomed to see-
ing.
"I (had) stopped noticing beggars on the
street," Khalid said. "It's something you get
used to."
Attending McGill University in Canada
before returning to Pakistan and later com-
ing to the University of Michigan in 2010,
Khalid said he was "extremely, extremely
excited" to begin classes at the University.
And as he approaches anew semester, Khalid
said he feels he has grown and changed from
his cricket playing days in Pakistan.
"I feel that I'm much more independent
than I was back home and much more confi-
dent," Khalidsaid.
Khalid said he feels lucky to have the
opportunity to study abroad in the United
States. It's an educational environment far
different from that of his own country, where
he claims women are lucky if they reach an
undergraduate education, and lives are dev-
astated by floods.
"Education is free here, education in Paki-
stan is not free. It's very, very limited ... I feel
that even if you have basic quality of educa-
tion that still motivates you to do something,"
Khalid said.
Balling his hand in his fist and striking the
table, Khalid said he is determined to com-
plete his education and eventually return to
Pakistan to teach children about world reli-
gions and historical events that most have
never heard of, like World War II. But most
of all, like his friends who have returned to
Pakistan, Khalid wants to see a change.
"I want to do the same because we all have

to put in effort to bring about a change. It has
to change sooner rather than later," he said.
JODAN
Engineering sophomore Issa Fakhoury
jokes that in his hometown of Amman, Jor-
dan, he doesn't live in a tent or ride a camel
to school.
In fact, when looking out his window at
home, Fakhoury saw a street that looks a lot
like a modern American city - one brimming
with cars and the vibrant lighting from fran-
chised restaurants. It's even possible to hear
the dim humming of Western films and tele-
vision shows in neighboring homes.
But each modern household contains a
family, a set of principles and traditions. For
Fakhoury, it's because of the close-knit com-
munity that allowed the large city to become
a hometown and gives Jordan life.
In his community made up of friends,
family, cousins and cousins of cousins, news
travels fast and, as Fakhoury says, almost
everything is public knowledge.
"It's a smaller community, you feel like
everyone knows each other. It seems like
wherever you go, you're going to see someone
you know and everyone knows what's going
on, which is a good thing and a bad thing," he
said.
But Fakhoury thrived on this proximity
as he met for Friday lunches with one set of
grandparents and spent Tuesdays with the
other. In between visits, Fakhoury found
time to play soccer (or football, as he calls it)
and attend a private school in the city.
Though he lived a modern life, the ancient
city of Petra is only three hours away, with
stone buildings surrounded by roads busy
with the traffic of donkeys and camels. As
one of the new Seven Wonders of the World,
the stone buildings of Petra are one of Fak-
houry's favorite places in the country. They
represent the older culture he carries with
him.
Bringing his culture from Petra's ancient
streets to the ivy-covered buildings of the
University, Fakhoury still likes to maintain a
connection with his country - waking up at
7 a.m. to watch soccer games in Jordan and

reading about current events and listening
to Jordanian radio stations, which Fakhoury
admits often play American music.
And even after he's attended American
football games and weathered the freshman
15 - which he jokes was actually 15 kilos
- Fakhoury said he still feels some of that
freshman uncertainty that initially led him
to the University.
"I never knew what I was going to be. I
still don't know what I want to do really. But I
wanted to come here, I wanted to get a differ-
ent experience," he said.
MALtAYSIA
Last semester, LSA freshman Zera Eri
Arika Zulkifli celebrated her first snowfall
by creating a snowman and snow angels
with her friends. It was one of many firsts for
Zulkifli, who is accustomed to the climate of
her home city, Ipoh, Malaysia, where a con-
stant warm rain falls from the skies.
"We (felt) kind of kiddish," Zulkifli said,
laughing.
For Zulkifli, the island of Penang, which
connects to the coast of Malaysia by a long
bridge, is a haven. Water skiing on the Malacca
Strait and lying on the island's sandy beaches
is how Zulkifli and her friends unwind from
the stressful schoolyear.
Last fall, however, Zulkifli found herself
in a much different setting. Walking into her
first day of class at the University, unsure but
excited, Zulkifli said she was shocked by the
openness of students, both in their friendli-
ness toward her and their frequent question-
ing of the professor. Faced with these friendly
students, Zulkifli said she was forced to over-
come her own shyness and adapt to the class-
room environment.
"I was really nervous like, 'am I going to fit
in?,' but it went well," she said.
Thoughshe describes the Malaysian people
as reserved and quiet, Zulkifli enthusiastically
described the adventures she wants to have in
college, which include trying ballroom danc-
ing, rock climbing and bungee jumping.
But even after one semester at the Univer-
sity, Zulkifli has had many new experiences.
