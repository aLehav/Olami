What was once 
Buzzn, a mobile 

application, will be 
phased into CTools

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

The University has acquired 

Buzzn, a social networking appli-
cation created by LSA senior Aas-
hay Kumar and University alum 
Zakir Tyebjee, who graduated in 
2014. The application allows stu-
dents to upload their course and 
extracurricular schedules to find 
shared free time to meet up with 
friends.

Kumar said they created the 

app for exclusive use by Univer-
sity students.

“There’s obviously Facebook, 

but it wasn’t as exclusive to 
Michigan as we wanted it to be,” 
he said. “You couldn’t know your 
class schedule. We wanted to cre-

University alums 
encourage students 
to pursue careers 
with automakers

By PAIGE PFLEGER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 2015 North American 

International Auto Show shifted 
into drive in Detroit on Monday, 
showcasing driverless cars, fully 
electric vehicles and an auto-
motive industry beginning to 
rebound.

For 
several 
companies 
— 

including Ford, General Motors 
and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, 
formerly known as Chrysler — 
the presence of University alums 
runs deep.

Two former GM chief execu-

tive officers, Roger Smith and 
Frederick Henderson, are Uni-
versity alums, as well as Hal 
Sperlich, a former president of 
Chrysler.

Inside Cobo Hall on Tuesday, 

several employees of FCA empha-
sized the opportunities in the 
state’s automotive industry avail-
able to University students.

Though former University stu-

dents work for a host of Detroit-
based companies involved in the 
automotive industry, representa-
tives from FCA were most imme-
diately available on the floor of 
the Auto Show.

“Detroit is the birthplace of the 

automotive industry,” said Uni-
versity alum Erica Crane, a com-
munication lead for FCA at its 
Jefferson North Assembly Plant.

“Being at the Auto Show today, 

it was clearer than ever to me that 
it’s going to be a huge part of the 
city’s future,” Crane added. “I 
know I want to be a part of that, 
and U of M students tend to be 
on the cutting edge of things like 
technology, 
engineering, 
and 

even the liberal arts. Those skills 
can all be applied in the automo-
tive industry.”

SCOTUS has yet 

to announce 

decision to hear 
Michigan’s case

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

The U.S. Supreme Court has 

yet to announce plans to hear 
a case challenging Michigan’s 
ban on same-sex marriage and 
many same-sex marriage advo-
cacy groups across the state are 
expressing their frustration.

While the U.S. Supreme Court 

has passed on hearing a same-sex 
marriage case from Louisiana, 
the court has yet to announce any 
information about the four cases 
from the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Sixth Circuit, includ-
ing the challenge to Michigan’s 
ban, DeBoer v. Snyder. The U.S. 
Supreme Court will have two 
more conference days this month, 
Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, in which these 
possible cases will be discussed.

Jay Kaplan, project staff attor-

ney for the American Civil Liber-

ties Union of Michigan’s LGBT 
Rights Project, said he is hopeful 
that the U.S. Supreme Court will 
take Michigan’s marriage case 
to hear on appeal. The Michigan 
marriage case, along with cases 
in Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio, 
is currently up for consideration 
by the Supreme Court.

“Now is the time for the United 

States Supreme Court to weigh 
in and to provide finality of the 
issue of marriage equality for all 
50 states,” Kaplan said. “It’s time 
for the remaining states (like 
Michigan) which do not permit 
marriage equality to join the fold 
and a favorable decision from the 
Supreme Court can provide both 
that clarity and finality.”

Last spring, U.S. District Judge 

Bernard Friedman struck down 
Michigan’s ban on same-sex 
marriage, a decision which was 
appealed after the state issued a 
stay on the ruling.

However, the U.S. Court of 

Appeals for the Sixth Circuit 
reversed the lower court’s ruling 
and upheld the ban in a decision 
announced by the last Novem-
ber. The three-member panel of 

Past resolution 
called for event, 
student activism, 

dialogue

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University’s 
Central 

Student Government began its 
first meeting of the semester 

by passing a resolution to fund 
Wednesday’s Police Brutality 
Speakout.

Sarah Zearfoss, senior assis-

tant dean for admissions at the 
University’s Law School, also 
attended the Tuesday night to 
discuss initiatives to recruit a 
diverse class of students.

Tuesday’s 
resolution 

requests $300 from CSG’s Leg-
islative Discretionary account 
to fund the Police Brutality 
Speakout, sponsored by CSG, 

the Black Student Union and 
Students of Color of Rackham. 
The money will fund room 
rental, audio-visual equipment 
and refreshments.

Last semester, CSG passed 

a resolution calling for a con-
versation on campus safety and 
police brutality. Wednesday’s 
Police Brutality Speakout is a 
product of that resolution.

CSG’s initiatives were in 

response to events in Ferguson,

Authors Guild filing 

against digital 

libraries is closed

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

A lawsuit filed by the Authors 

Guild in the fall of 2011 against 
five HathiTrust Digital Library 

institutions, including the Uni-
versity, formally concluded Jan. 
6.

According to Mike Furlough, 

the University’s executive direc-
tor of HathiTrust, the lawsuit 
has been formally settled.

HathiTrust is a coalition that 

compiles millions of digitized 
titles from its 100-plus academic 
and research library partners 
and the University is one of its 
founding members. Its web-
site, hathitrust.org, gives users 

around the world the ability to 
conduct full-text searches of 
its 13 million volumes. It fur-
ther preserves works —many 
of which would otherwise only 
be available in their print copy 
forms — by maintaining them 
online and provides book access 
to people with certified print dis-
abilities.

The original lawsuit cited 

allegations of copyright infringe-
ment against the University and 
four other HathiTrust contribu-

tors — Indiana University, Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, Cornell 
University and the University of 
California system.

Similarly, the Authors Guild 

filed 
an 
additional 
lawsuit 

against Google for its digitiza-
tion of works.

The Authors Guild filed the 

lawsuit believing that these 
universities’ digital HathiTrust 
collections infringed upon copy-
right laws, citing the fact that

Michigan students to know when 
they’re free.”

Sean 
DeMonner, 
executive 

director of Teaching and Learn-
ing for Information and Technol-
ogy Services, said buying the app 
in August constituted a valuable 
investment for the University.

“In the process, we concluded 

that there was some value that we 
were interested in learning from 
Aashay and Zakir,” he said. “How 
they had thought about this prob-
lem, how they had formulated a 
solution — we came to a conclu-
sion to purchase the holdings of 
the company they had formed.”

Kumar 
and 
DeMonner 

declined to disclose the Univer-
sity’s purchase price.

The University is planning to 

add the application’s mechanisms 
to its CTools gateway pages, 
according to Kumar.

DeMonner said the Univer-

sity’s current online tools such 
as Wolverine Access and CTools 
don’t include modern social fea-
tures, like Buzzn.

“We’re interested in trying to 

understand how students think 
about these features and capabil-

ities, also seeing if we can apply 
those learnings to services avail-
able from the University,” he said.

Kumar and Tyebjee have been 

friends since meeting during 
Welcome Week in 2012. Since 
neither originally knew much 
about coding, they outsourced 
the iPhone and Android beta test 
version of the application. After 
the beta launched in April 2013, 
the students hired two more 
developers that summer to create 
a more developed version, which 
launched in 2014.

The two had been in contact 

with Engineering Dean David 
Munson since they began work-
ing on the app.

“He’s always open to talking to 

students,” Kumar said. “He told 
us to just build it because that’s 
when we were going to see if this 
would be useful or not.”

Munson eventually brought 

the students’ idea to the Uni-
versity’s attention, resulting in 
a meeting between Kumar, Tye-
bjee and Laura Patterson, the 
University’s chief information 
officer.

After 
the 
University 
pur-

chased the app, Kumar and Tye-
bjee shut down the iPhone and 
Android 
versions. 
DeMonner 

said the acquisition was part of 

an effort to learn more from the 
University’s students.

“We’re also trying to get better 

at interacting with the student 
body in general,” he said. “We’re 
trying to better understand how 
they think about technology, how 
they want to use technology, and 
trying to make sure that input is 
reflected in our services.”

Kumar said he and Tyebjee 

started to really work on the app 
when they realized the product 
could be useful to many students.

“We originally thought this 

was just our issue, but as we talk-
ed to more people, we realized 
that this could be useful for the 
general Michigan population,” 
he said.

For Kumar, the most use-

ful part of the app is “Groups,” 
which allows people to make 
groups with their roommates 
or others — allowing the app to 
automatically show when every-
one is busy.

LSA senior Alec Pinchak, who 

used the Buzzn mobile applica-
tion before the University pur-
chased it, said Buzzn was useful 
and easy to work with.

“I use it a lot to meet up with 

people I work with, as well as 
friends,” he said. “It’s really con-
venient and simple to use.”

SEXUAL ASSAULT

The University of Virginia has 

reinstated its chapter of the Phi 
Kappa Psi fraternity after a police 
investigation did not find any evi-
dence of the alleged gang rape 
detailed in a controversial article 
in Rolling Stone Magazine, The 
Cavalier Daily reported Monday.

UVA President Teresa A. Sulli-

van announced the decision after 
Charlottesville Police Depart-
ment officials told the univer-
sity they did not find “substantive 
basis to confirm that the allega-
tions raised in the Rolling Stone 
article occurred at Phi Kappa 
Psi.”

“We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, 

and we look forward to working 
with all fraternities and sorori-
ties in enhancing and promoting 

a safe environment for all,” Sulli-
van wrote in a statement.

Columbia University under 

investigation for mishandling 

sexual assaults

Columbia University officials 

confirmed that the school is par-
ticipating in two federal investi-
gations by the U.S. Department 
of Education’s Office for Civil 
Rights over the school’s han-
dling of sexual assault and 
harassment cases, The Columbia 
Spectator reported.

The Department of Educa-

tion is reviewing Columbia’s 
compliance with Title IX, which 
prohibits 
discrimination 
on 

the basis of gender and Title II, 

which prohibits discrimination 
by public entities on the basis of 
ability.

The investigations opened 

Jan. 8 following federal com-
plaints filed against the univer-
sity by 23 Columbia and Barnard 
College students last spring 
alleging violations of Title II, 
Title IX and the Clery Act.

Columbia and Barnard join 

a list of 93 universities under 
investigation for their handling 
of sexual misconduct cases, 
including 
the

of

resurgence. 
In 
his 

speech, Obama cited the indus-
try’s recovery as an example of 
America’s recovery post-econom-
ic recession.

Vice President Joe Biden vis-

ited the Auto Show Jan. 15, 2014. 
There, he spoke of similar themes 
of recovery in the auto industry 
and praised automakers for cre-
ating middle-class jobs amid eco-
nomic downturn.

University alum Tom Finelli 

initially planned to pursue aero-
space engineering, but when he 
graduated in 1992 there were not 
many jobs in the field. After a few 
career moves, and returning to 
school for his business degree, 
he became the vice president of 
purchasing and supplier quality 
for FCA.

“Michigan 
and 
the 
metro 

Detroit area have a lot to offer, 
even outside of the opportuni-
ties within Chrysler,” he said. 
“We have really made an effort to 
promote not only Detroit but the 
state of Michigan and the advan-
tages that young people have 
by living here. You can see here 
everyday in the city of Detroit the 
rebirth that is going on.”

Finelli said like Detroit, the 

auto industry is on the rise — and 
as the companies grow, so does 

their demand for workers. The 
job market has continued to grow 
so extensively in Southeastern 
Michigan that it’s becoming diffi-
cult for FCA to find enough talent 
in the area, he added.

University alum Brian John-

son, the executive business plan-
ner in Purchasing and Supplier 
Quality for FCA, echoed Finelli’s 
sentiments and stressed that stu-
dents don’t need to leave the state 
to find jobs. He made reference 
to the book “Acres of Diamonds” 
by Russel Connell, which he said 
“talks about this guy that goes 
and searches the whole world to 
find his diamonds when they’re 
really right under his feet.”

“I kind of equate that to the 

automotive industry; what we have 
in Detroit where there’s a great 
opportunity for students that are 
graduating here,” Johnson said. 
“The opportunity that exists in the 
automotive industry is huge.”

FCA is one of many employ-

ers that actively recruit Univer-
sity students. Crane found her 
job after participating in Chrysler 
internship program.

“There’s so many jobs, even if 

they’re not in automotive, that are 
connected to automotive,” she said. 
“At the Auto Show, I ran into fellow 
U of M students who were report-
ers, who were product specialists, 
who were there for all sorts of dif-
ferent functions, all because it was 
an automotive-based event.”

judges, who began hearing oral 
arguments from both sides last 
August, ruled in a 2-1 decision.

Numerous marriage-equality 

interest groups have expressed 
their frustration with the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s lack of action 
pertaining to same-sex mar-
riage.

Michigan Attorney General 

Bill Schuette issued a statement 
Friday after the U.S. Supreme 
Court did not announce a deci-
sion. Schuette has vowed to 
enforce the state’s ban.

“I am hopeful the court will 

eventually take up this issue and 
optimistic they will choose to 
do so at their next conference,” 
Schuette said. “The sooner the 

United States Supreme Court 
makes a decision on this issue 
the better it will be for Michigan 
and America.”

Emily Dievendorf, executive 

director of the advocacy organi-
zation Equality Michigan, said 
the state of Michigan is more 
than ready to join the 36 other 
states where same-sex marriage 
is legal.

Brad O’Conner, vice presi-

dent of the Jim Toy Community 
Center, said the wait for many 
Michigan couples, for both in-
state and out-of-state licensure, 
has been difficult and emotional.

“With the arc continuing to 

bend toward justice in the Unit-
ed States, we look forward to the 
day when all families, not just 
here in Michigan, but nation-
wide are recognized under the 
law,” he said.

Mo. in which unarmed Black 
teenager Michael Brown was 
shot by a white police officer, 
sparking a nationwide debate on 
racial stereotyping and police 
violence.

Later in the meeting, Zear-

foss, the Law School assistant 
dean, discussed minority enroll-
ment at the University dur-
ing the time allotted for guest 
speakers at CSG meetings.

Zearfoss discussed the his-

tory of minority enrollment at 
the University, including a time-
line of U.S. Supreme Court cases 
related to affirmative action and 
the state of Michigan’s 2006 
passage of Proposal 2, which 
banned the use of affirmative 

action in admissions.

“Racial diversity improves 

the dialogue on campus and the 
learning environment,” she said.

In recent months, several 

events have called on the Uni-
versity to improve its efforts to 
recruit and enroll minority stu-
dents, including protests and 
campaigns organized by the 
BSU.

Zearfoss said the Law School 

makes a concentrated effort 
to recruit a diverse applicant 
pool by personally reaching out 
to potential students, visiting 
campuses and waiving applica-
tion fees. However, these efforts 
have not yielded a significantly 
diverse enrollment.

“All of the steps we take are 

useful and helpful but it will 
never substitute the more direct 
route of just taking race into 

account,” she said. “So, it will 
always be something we have to 
continually give attention to and 
examine to see what we can do 
better.”

CSG representatives had the 

opportunity to ask Zearfoss 
questions after she finished 
speaking.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, asked 
about the potential implemen-
tation and impact of pipeline 
programs, outreach programs 
designed to prepare targeted 
students for higher education.

Zearfoss said pipeline pro-

grams would not be effective for 
ensuring diversity in a program 
as competitive as the Univer-
sity’s Law School.

“I think making personal con-

nections is the key for us,” she 
said.

Dec. 15, a man dressed as a 
Muslim cleric took a num-

ber of people 
hostage 
in 
a 

busy café. Aus-
tralian 
police 

were 
able 
to 

kill the gun-
man and there-
after freed the 
hostages. Two 
hostages 
died 

in the incident.

In the after-

math 
of 
this 

crisis, Muslims 
in 
Australia 

feared they would be subject to 
hate crimes, as is common in 
the aftermath of such events. 
Australian Rachel Jacobs was 
sitting on a public train when 
she noticed a Muslim woman 
begin to remove her hijab, the 
Muslim headscarf, as a result of 
this fear. Jacobs ran up to this 
Muslim woman at the train sta-
tion and told her to put the hijab 
back on, and reassured her by 
saying “I’ll walk with you.” The 
Muslim woman began to cry and 
hugged Rachel in appreciation. 
Jacobs wrote about the incident 
on Twitter, which resulted in 
the 
hashtag 
#illridewithyou. 

Australians tweeted the hashtag 
with offers to ride the train with 
Muslims to offer them a sense 
of safety. The tweet trended 
worldwide, 
because 
people 

were touched by these acts 
of kindness and responses by 
 

the Australians.

Although this is not the only 

form of activism necessary to 
create change, the first battle is 
always awareness. Social media 
is bridging the gap between 
what major news sources write 
and the general public opinion.

Some people may think that 

activism through social media 
is not true activism, but positive 
responses to Twitter activism 
prompted 
major 
mainstream 

news sources to cover it as a 
legitimate form of activism. In 
this way, news sources turned 
away from arguments from peo-
ple that view the Islamic doc-
trine as inherently violent and 
turned toward talking about the 
problems of anti-Muslim back-
lash, recognizing Islamophobia 
as a problem. They encouraged 
peace and solidarity with these 
Muslims, and went a step fur-
ther by encouraging people to 
take action by offering help to 
Australian Muslims.

As a Muslim woman who 

wears hijab, I am grateful for 
people like Rachel Jacobs. My 
hijab is a symbol of a choice that 
I made and a reflection of my 
beliefs. In all honesty, it is my 
favorite part of my religion and 
it pains me to see that someone 
could fear so much for their own 
life that they feel forced to take 
it off. Some may assume that 
every person who wears hijab is 
forced to by someone else, mak-
ing it difficult for me to explain 
that, as an American-born Mus-
lim, I freely choose to wear my 
hijab. While I fear the possibility 
of hate crimes during times such 
as these, I also feel that people 
are becoming more and more 
aware of the difference between 
Muslims and extremists.

Social media activism played 

a role in spreading both aware-
ness and support for the protests 
in Ferguson and against police 
brutality. Protesters live-tweeted 
with hashtags like #PrayforFer-
guson and #BlackLivesMatter. 
Again, the prevalence of social 
media made it so major news 
sources could not ignore Fergu-
son and its ties to racism. Instead 
of treating Ferguson as an isolated 
case in which only one town was 
affected, it became recognized as 
part of a greater national problem. 
Whether or not this would have 
happened without social media 
can only be speculated, but it did 
make the news travel much faster 

through average people witness-
ing the protests.

In addition to this, it attracted 

awareness and support from 
celebrities 
and 
athletes 
like 

Detroit 
Lions 
running 
back 

Reggie Bush and many others 
from the NFL, as well NBA players 
such as LeBron James and Kobe 
Bryant, who all wrote “I Can’t 
Breathe” on their shirts during 
pregame warm-ups. This was 
originally a hashtag on Twitter as 
a tribute to Eric Garner’s words as 
he was tackled by police officers. 
These athletes’ actions brought 
a new group of people into 
 

the conversation.

As a Muslim, the hashtag 

#illridewithyou 
warmed 
my 

heart. It gave me hope that maybe 
more people see Islam the way I 
see it, or maybe the world is slowly 
starting to realize the difference 
between Islam and people who 
use the name of Islam for their 
own agendas. I cannot speak on 
behalf of African Americans who 
have been subjected to racism, 
but my hope is that the awareness 
spread via social media about 
police brutality made them feel 
that someone is speaking out 
 

for them.

Social media activism can be a 

catalyst for change and the begin-
nings of much larger movements, 
as anyone with Internet access 
can write their opinion and share 
it with a large audience. This 
gives people who may have been 
previously overlooked the power 
to speak their mind, particularly 
young people. This can cause an 
overwhelming sense of commu-
nity and solidarity, giving people 
a sense that there are others that 
agree with their viewpoint as 
well. Social media allows a post to 
travel from one end of the world 
to another, in a matter of seconds, 
connecting the globe and allow-
ing solidarity to be spread.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

It goes without saying that 

Leelah Alcorn’s suicide is about 
more than just Leelah Alcorn. 
It’s about the thousands of 
LGBTQ young people in the 
United States and abroad whose 
collective torment led about a 
third of them to attempt suicide 
by the age of 18. Of the hun-
dreds or thousands of LGBTQ 
youth who committed suicide in 
2014, why is it that Leelah has 
become the focus of the debate? 
Because of her note. Her note, 
controlled and alive in the face 
of unimaginable pain, shows us 
an inescapably real human being 
in an inescapably real tragedy. 
Her voice, more than any photo-
graph, breaks through the noise 
and forces us to recognize her.

Anger has been a large part 

of the reaction to her suicide 
and note: anger at her par-
ents, now grieving the loss of 
a child as they receive harass-
ing phone calls, messages and 
death threats daily; anger on 
behalf of a generation of LGBTQ 
youth at the society that did this, 
with her suicide note ending in 
a simple request: “Fix society. 
Please.”; anger that her society 
didn’t listen to her.

This anger, among many reac-

tions, is justified, but the focus 
of the reporting and the discus-
sion must be on LGBTQ youth 
across the United States, not 
on Leelah’s parents or the indi-

viduals around her. (Although 
she has no notes to be read, 
Leelah’s mother is a real person 
too, a person who has just lost a 
child.) Focusing on only Leelah 
risks doing a terrible thing: 
contributing to the danger that 
affects a whole generation of 
 

LGBTQ youth.

Four times as many LGBTQ 

youth attempt suicide as hetero-
sexual youth. It’s a fact that the 
risk that an LGBTQ teenager 
will attempt suicide is high. At 
a time when an LGBTQ suicide 
has entered into the sympa-
thies and minds of hundreds of 
thousands or millions across 
the country, that risk becomes 
highest. Leelah’s note, originally 
posted on Tumblr and subse-
quently shared by many media 
outlets, has likely been read by 
hundreds of thousands, if not 
millions, of people. In it, she says 
it doesn’t get better, that it gets 
worse, that all that awaits her is 
a life of loneliness. There is no 
way out.

We need to be careful about 

sharing 
this 
message 
in 
a 

country with millions of LGBTQ 
youths at risk. We spread these 
messages of despair as messages 
that must be read and taken 
in, that must not be ignored. It 
puts a nation of LGBTQ youth 
in danger to share these urgent 
messages of despair without also 
spreading messages of hope. It 

can get better. Life is long, and 
loneliness, 
misunderstanding 

and pain are not all that awaits 
you. Do not do as Leelah 
 

has done.

Leelah’s note ends with a 

glimmer of hope. After saying 
that all of her possessions should 
be given to trans civil rights 
movements, she ends her note 
by writing, “The only way I will 
rest in peace is if one day trans-
gender people aren’t treated the 
way I was. … My death needs 
to mean something. My death 
needs to be counted in the num-
ber of transgender people who 
commit suicide this year. I want 
someone to look at that number 
and say ‘that’s fucked up’ and fix 
it. Fix society. Please.”

We can’t let her down by 

focusing only on her and not the 
generation of LGBTQ youth who 
are still alive and still in danger 
in America. By sharing Leelah’s 
note with no context other than 
statements of agreement with 
her and the urgency of her mes-
sage, we risk encouraging hope-
lessness, anger and suicide in the 
minds of many young people. We 
need to talk about Leelah as well 
as about a generation of teenag-
ers who can be saved. Together 
with the story of this tragedy, 
there is one thing that also needs 
to be heard: that it can get better.

JEFFREY SUN | VIEWPOINT

Hope and Leelah Alcorn 

E

very break, as I try to 
escape 
the 
Univer-

sity’s 
enclosed 
sphere 

of 
academia, 

I’m 
remind-

ed 
— 
after 

approximately 
a 
seven-hour 

drive 
and 
a 

family 
dis-

cussion — of 
the extent to 
which 
educa-

tion is firmly 
entwined with 
my life. Memo-
ries of chalk-
boards, glossy 
motivational posters and the 
smells of acrylic paint and glue 
wafting through the air perme-
ate the mind of every former pub-
lic school student. In more ways 
than one, I’ve literally grown up 
in a classroom.

My family’s livelihood and my 

financial ability to attend college 
depend upon Michigan’s public 
education system. My mother 
works as an elementary school 
teacher, while my dad is the head 
custodian at a high school in my 
hometown. As a little girl, my 
afternoons were spent bouncing 
between my parents’ respective 
workplaces. If I wasn’t coloring 
or placing graded assignments 
back on empty student desks in 
my mom’s classroom, I was with 
my father who briefly acquired a 
tiny shadow with a messy blonde 
mop-top as he traversed the 
halls 
emptying 
wastebaskets. 

However, 
my 
parents 
are 

certainly not the only members 
of this surrounding community 
of educators. My family’s circle of 
friends includes a sizeable portion 
of 
custodians, 
teachers 
and 

administrators; even some of my 
closest friends are the children 
 

of teachers.

For a while, friends outside of 

the education circle held onto the 
peculiar notion that my mother’s 
occupation bolstered my academ-
ic performance somehow — as if 
she wrote a separate lesson plan 
for home and quizzed me during 
dinnertime. They were surpris-
ingly right in one respect. While 
I thankfully never received any 
extra assignments at home, I 
quickly learned education is 
both an extremely important 
and tremendously costly venture. 
Likewise, a strong work ethic is 
indispensable. As the daughter 
of a teacher and a custodian, I 
saw firsthand the vast amount of 
effort necessary to manage and 

maintain a classroom. I watched 
and waited in the background as 
my mother spent hours prepar-
ing for the next day’s lesson, or as 
my father arrived home late after 
a long evening of cleaning.

As 
I 
grew, 
I 
came 
to 

understand 
that 
although 

education is absolutely crucial for 
the development of our society, 
it’s also severely underfunded 
and inaccessible to far too many 
people. The sight of my mother 
buying supplies demonstrated 
how 
money 
from 
teacher 

paychecks often contributes to 
keeping a classroom stocked. 
Education, no matter the grade 
level, is expensive. As students 
matriculate 
in 
the 
public 

school system, the price of 
education evolves from teachers 
supplementing the classroom’s 
supply of construction paper and 
crayons to students assuming 
massive sums of student loan 
debt — as well as time-consuming 
part-time jobs — in order to 
afford tuition, books, rent and 
everyday essentials.

According to an analysis con-

ducted by a youth advocacy group 
known as Young Invincibles, the 
state of Michigan’s attempts to 
offer funding for higher educa-
tion deserve a failing grade. The 
group ranked states’ investments 
in higher education by measuring 
five criteria: tuition, state appro-
priations average, average bur-
den on families, financial aid for 
students and higher education as 
a priority. Young Invincibles then 
issued each state in the country a 
report card. Tom Allison, policy 
and research manager at Young 
Invincibles, speculated in an 
interview that cuts to the educa-
tion budget were one of many fac-
tors contributing to Michigan’s 
poor performance. For example, 
during the beginning of Gov. 
Rick Snyder’s first term in 2011, 
the amount of money allocated 
for funding higher education was 
reduced by 15 percent.

In another interview respond-

ing to the ranking, Donald Heller, 
dean of the College of Education 
at Michigan State University, 
stated: “The cut in state funding 
which has caused the universi-
ties to raise tuition very rapidly … 
The relatively high rate of tuition 
in the first place and the rela-
tively low grade of spending by 
the state on scholarships means 
Michigan is a fairly unaffordable 
state for higher education for 
most students.”

Increasing tuition and deplet-

ing state assistance for high-
er education further hinders 
students of lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds from attaining a 
degree or attending any academic 
institution of higher education 
in the first place. An alternative 
method to improve the acces-
sibility of higher education was 
recently proposed by President 
Barack Obama last week. Follow-
ing a plan that is already in place 
in Tennessee, Obama’s proposed 
tuition initiative guarantees that 
“two years of community col-
lege will become as free and uni-
versal as high school is today.” 
The tuition plan, if enacted, 
would offer free community col-
lege tuition to qualifying stu-
dents for three years as long as 
they attend school at least half-
time and maintain a 2.5 grade 
 

point average.

Unfortunately, the plan as it 

currently stands doesn’t nec-
essarily offer a definitive plan 
of action. The program would 
greatly benefit Pell Grant recipi-
ents who attend community col-
lege by financing their tuition and 
allowing them to use grant funds 
toward cost-of-living expenses. 
However, the program would 
also offer assistance to students 
of the upper and middle classes, 
who may not often be in desperate 
need for these funds. Likewise, 
other flaws in the initiative could 
include the states’ reluctance to 
partially fund the program and 
the need to reform community 
college courses so they provide 
a bridge between institutions by 
offering credit that’s transfer-
able to other universities. Also, if 
enacted, the program should be 
amended to offer aid to students 
attending four-year institutions 
as well.

Considering 
countries 
like 

Germany and Finland offer free 
tuition to their college students 
— and even to English-speaking 
international students — Obama’s 
proposal hopefully demonstrates 
an impending reform in the 
realm of U.S. education. The plan 
is not perfect, but it’s a spark to 
reignite a broken system. Edu-
cation is crucial but costly. 
Whether Obama’s plan is passed 
or not, the fate of the initiative’s 
main goal in future legislation 
will illustrate to the public how 
much our elected officials actu-
ally value providing access to 
 

quality education.

‘Fifty Shades’ 

soundtrack latest in 
new musical trend

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

“Fifty 
Shades 
of 
Grey.” 

Romance. Sex. BDSM. Music?

It all started about six months 

ago when Beyoncé posted a teas-
er for the “Fifty Shades of Grey” 
film featuring a slow and intense-
ly sensual “uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, 
oh no no.” It’s a clear rework of 
her debut solo single, “Crazy in 
Love.”

Movie 
soundtracks 
have 

picked up considerable steam 
in the past year. Some recent 
examples include Charli XCX’s 
“Boom Clap” for “The Fault in 
Our Stars” and the Lorde-curat-
ed 
“Mockingjay” 
soundtrack. 

Never have soundtracks been as 
star-studded and successful as 
they are now. As one of the most 
talked about books/movies, it 
comes as no surprise that the 
“Fifty Shades” soundtrack will 
be nothing short of incredible 
(especially with the legitimacy 
Beyoncé grants everything she 
touches).

Clearly, Beyoncé didn’t simply 

remake the short clip. Five days 
later the full trailer was released, 
revealing a nearly entire remix. 
It’s sultry, to say the least, and it 
works perfectly with the prem-
ise of “Fifty Shades.” Then to 
throw gas on the fire, a second 
trailer was released in November 
featuring Beyoncé’s appropri-
ately-titled “Haunted,” another 
tantalizingly sexual track.

Originally, it seemed that Bey 

might have been curating this 
soundtrack in the same man-
ner Lorde handled “Mocking-
jay.” However, in past weeks, it 
seemed as if Universal Studios 
were rolling the album out as 
just that: an album. More than 
that, they’re doing it brilliant-
ly. A Beyoncé teaser to get the 
entire world’s attention on the 
project? Check. Now, instead of 
simply releasing the full rework, 
“Earned It” by The Weeknd 
pops up on iTunes, landing 
itself in the top ten a couple days 
before Christmas. The Weeknd’s 
electric vocals keep the song’s 
sound in check with its con-
tent. Even the title, “Earned It,” 
lends an air of dominance to 
the track. Now, just as the new-
ness of “Earned It” has worn 
off, and the Beyoncé void has 
opened up again, Ellie Gould-
ing has released the beautifully 

crafted “Love Me Like You Do” 
on iTunes.

The lyrics are infatuated, 

yearning and intelligent. They 
embody everything that is Ana 
Steele, 
the 
novel’s 
protago-

nist. Alternatively, “Earned It” 
is protective and demanding, 
akin to Christian Grey himself. 
This musical representation of 
today’s most controversial love 
story is completed by expertly 
designed cover art. “Earned It” 
showcases strength undone in 
love — Jamie Dornan (“Once 
Upon A Time”) in a designer 
suit and undone tie. “Love Me 
Like You Do” features a nose-
to-chest shot of Dakota Johnson 
(“The Five-Year Engagement”) 
biting her lip. Both covers are in 
shades of black, white and sil-
ver, thus tying the movie, books 
and soundtrack into a perfectly 
orchestrated multi-media brand.

Music has always been an 

intricate aspect of film, but 
recently it has gone beyond 
enhancing 
the 
stories 
told 

through movies. Now, a good 
soundtrack tells the complete 
story through a separate medi-
um. While fans of the trilogy 
are feverishly rereading the first 
installment in anticipation of 
the film, I will be patiently wait-
ing for the soundtrack.

Sexy soundtrack 
for ‘Fifty Shades’

Fifty shades of Bey.

San Cristobal bring 
live set to Blind Pig

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

For budding Ann Arbor art-

ists, performing frequently is 
key. “The number one thing is 
just playing as 
much as pos-
sible,” 
said 

Jacob Sigman, 
lead singer of 
student 
six-

piece 
band 

San Cristobal.

This maxim 

has undoubtedly proved success-
ful for the group, which has been 
sling-shotted forward with full 
force since my first interview 
with Sigman last spring. The 
group 
performs 
back-to-back 

weekends, is recording a new 
album and is constantly increas-
ing its social media presence (as 
evidenced by its omnipresence 
on my news feed.)

This Saturday, Jan. 17, San 

Cristobal will showcase their 
new sound at the Blind Pig, argu-
ably Ann Arbor’s most endearing 
music hot-spot, and an impres-
sive venue to land for any young 
musician. After playing there in 
1989, Nirvana went on to call the 
Blind Pig the band’s favorite place 
to perform, ever. Ann Arbor bands 
Which Way the Train and Yada 
Yada will open the show.

When Sigman sent me “Lovely 

Lisa,” a new track featuring 16 
string and brass players from the 
University’s School of Music, The-
atre & Dance, I hardly recognized 
the explosion of melody as the 
same band. While the band began 
with relatively humble roots, only 
playing music Sigman had writ-
ten in high school, they quickly 
found a groove and began writing 
as a group. Now, San Cristobal has 
departed almost entirely from its 
folksy early days to a much larg-
er sound. Sigman describes the 
music as having “a ’60s Beatles 
pop vibe ... tighter and snappier.”

The band has made enormous 

strides in musicianship. Its new 
songs demonstrate a far greater 
level of intricacy and complexity 
as each player has come into their 

own, a feat Sigman is proud of.

“There’s a lot of really talented 

people behind the scenes, the 
other guys in San Cristobal, the 
string and brass players, the audio 
recording majors who helped do 
the mixing and put their spin on 
things,” he said of the improved 
collaborative process.

San Cristobal attributes much 

of their growth to the important 
relationships they have formed 
with other Ann Arbor musicians 
and groups.

“I like showing our music to 

other musicians. We kind of geek 
out together to some of the stuff 
we do,” Sigman says.

He mentions Yada Yada, Which 

Way the Train, Caves, Chris Ter-
rell, The Euphorics and Asante as 
a few student bands in the commu-
nity who support each other.

“People know what’s up and 

they’ll go and we hype each other 
up,” Sigman said.

One of the band’s triumphs was 

learning what it takes to record in 
a studio, which also proved to be 
one of their biggest challenges. It 
can be difficult to preserve the raw 
quality of home recordings and 
demo tracks once in the studio. 
Sigman noted, “That’s something 
we wanted to keep. So taking it 
from that point to a point where 
we can release it takes a lot of work 

with a lot of different people. It’s 
challenging but exciting.”

Sigman showed me an exam-

ple of the way that this works, 
the bits and pieces, often record-
ed separately, coming together in 
the studio. He played a vocal line 
of high-pitched “ahs” in its bare-
boned form. Then, he played me 
the part of the song into which 
the line was thickly woven in 
later, accompanied by the rest of 
the band and a saxophone.

In the concert on Saturday, 

San Cristobal will premiere 
several new songs, and two oth-
ers from its new album, accom-
panied by Chris Tabaczynski, 
a saxophone player from the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance. While the music is 
widely available from San Cris-
tobal on the Internet, Sigman 
explained that “it’s not really 
indicative of (the band’s) sound. 
That’s why we’re excited to 
show people what we’re really 
about with this new album.”

Gauging by my own excite-

ment over two tracks played 
through a laptop, the live deliv-
ery will be worth seeing. This 
kind of music feels designed to 
get people moving and is fed by 
the enthusiasm of the audience, 
who will no doubt be compelled 
to provide it.

Weak plot in 
static ‘Eyes’

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

In an era when women like 

Beyoncé, Sheryl Sandberg and 
Chimimanda Adichie make power 
moves left and right, it may be dif-
ficult to remember the recent past 
when women didn’t even have a 
chance to build their reputations 

in professional fields.

Set during that period of pro-

fessional exclusion, “Big Eyes” 
follows the true story of artist 
Margaret Keane (Amy Adams, 
“American Hustle”), whose hus-
band took credit for her wildly 
successful paintings of haunted-
eyed children. Fresh out of an 
abusive marriage with nothing 

but a typical ’50s housewife’s non-
existent work experience, Marga-
ret attempts to sell her paintings 
on 
the 
streets 

to support her-
self 
and 
her 

young daughter. 
She 
soon 
suc-

cumbs to neigh-
boring 
artist 

Walter 
Keane’s 

(Christoph 
Waltz, 
“Django 

Unchained”) 
charms, and accepts his whirlwind 
marriage proposal to keep custody 
of her daughter.

However, Walter ensnares her 

into another form of abusive mar-
riage. Though Margaret is infatu-
ated by his initial flirtations, he still 

comes off a little too slick, a little 
too slimy. He parlays that egotism 
into business acumen when he 
relentlessly chases social connec-
tions he doesn’t have in order to 
market his subpar paintings. But 
Margaret’s work is what draws the 
crowds, and little by little, Wal-
ter assumes credit for them. Her 
meager art stand blossoms into a 
sprawling print phenomenon … but 
with Walter’s celebrity persona at 
the head.

Adams deftly portrays Marga-

ret’s tumultuous journey to take 
back her art, and more importantly, 
her life. She encapsulates Margaret 
as fragile without seeming weak, 
and balances a plethora of conflict-
ing emotions – anger, betrayal, 
independent strength – realistically 

and profoundly. Waltz’s perfor-
mance counters Adams’s well. His 
smarmy arrogance interspersed 
with legitimate threats showcas-
es a side of abusive relationships 
that the public does not always 
acknowledge: a man acting in the 
name of benevolence, but actu-
ally fostering a dominating, toxic 
domestic life. It’s an empowering 
feminist story that is guaranteed 
to sell in today’s cultural climate.

Unfortunately, though people 

will appreciate the plot, it remains 
relatively 
static. 
The 
trailer 

reveals the full story, so the audi-
ence enters the theater already 
cognizant of the events to follow. 
Of course, no one can demand 
storytelling suspense from a 
film based on a true, well-known 

series of events. Still, many of 
Margaret’s most probing, self-
reflective scenes find their way 
into the trailer, robbing the audi-
ence of the chance to appreciate 
them with the full chronology of 
events. As such, though the film is 
well done overall, the majority of 
viewing time feels like an extend-
ed version of the trailer.

But 
thankfully, 
some 
of 

Waltz’s and Adams’s most pow-
erful scenes, particularly toward 
the end of the film, do remain 
out of the trailer. “Big Eyes” 
should not be about plot twists, 
or a complex story, but rather, 
the individual characters and 
their relationships with them-
selves and each other, and in 
that respect, it succeeds.

CONCERT PREVIEW

HathiTrust did not ask the per-
mission of copyright holders 
before digitizing their works.

In a 2012 decision, Judge Har-

old Baer of the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New 
York ruled all of HathiTrust’s 
endeavors fall under fair use.

Fair use is a provision of copy-

right law that allows for the use 
of copyrighted works provided 
their use is for nonprofit educa-
tional purposes or that it doesn’t 
affect the market value of the 
copyrighted work, among other 
criteria.

Though the U.S. District Court 

for the Southern District of 
New York ruled in HathiTrust’s 
favor in 2012, the Authors Guild 
appealed the ruling. Ultimately, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
2nd Circuit evaluated the case 
in 2014. Again the court ruled 
in HathiTrust’s favor, stating 
that no copyright laws had been 
violated. However, the court 
remanded the case back to the 
district court to settle disagree-
ment over HathiTrust’s practice 
of replacing works that are lost or 
destroyed.

To resolve this element of 

the lawsuit, Furlough said the 
University cited Section 108 of 
the Copyright Act. This sec-
tion states “it is not an infringe-
ment of copyright for a library or 
archives, or any of its employees 
acting within the scope of their 
employment, to reproduce no 
more than one copy or phonore-
cord of a work.”

Furlough said the Authors 

Guild accepted the stipulation, 
which led to the lawsuit’s official 
resolution.

The 
Authors 
Guild 
was 

unavailable for comment.

Paul Courant, a professor of 

public policy, economics and 
information 
who 
previously 

served as the University’s dean of 
libraries from 2007 to 2013, said 
he was glad to see the case offi-
cially come to a close.

“I’m very pleased that it’s 

over,” he said. “We’ve agreed to 
continue to make legal uses and 
to be careful. We were doing that 
all along and that now seems to 
be satisfactory. It concludes what 
has been a long and arduous 
experience of dealing with this 
lawsuit.”

Courant added that only occa-

sionally have individual authors 
objected to having their pieces 
copied for HathiTrust’s digitiza-
tion.

“Part of our point defined in 

this suit is that we haven’t done 
anything that would cut into the 
ability of authors, members of the 
Authors Guild and other copy-
right holders to do what they’re 
doing,” he said. “We never actu-
ally made anything openly avail-
able, except to people with print 
disabilities.”

For the general public, the only 

service that HathiTrust offers 
is the full-text search research 
capability. This service allows 
anyone on the web to search 
through digitized works and find 
where in the work their search 
item appears.

However, the full work itself is 

generally not made available. The 
only works that are made fully 
accessible are already available 
in the public domain or those 
whose copyright holders have 
granted explicit permission.

For Jack Bernard, the Univer-

sity’s associate general counsel, 
the end of this case means more 
time to focus on HathiTrust’s 
initiatives — one of which is its 
commitment to making works 
accessible for people with print 
disabilities.

“Until HathiTrust came along, 

the library was not equally acces-
sible to patrons who had print 
disabilities,” Bernard said.

He noted that while other peo-

ple are able to go to the library 
and easily access research mate-
rials, people with print disabili-
ties are not.

“It may take a couple of 

months for someone to digitize 
those works or to read them into 
a tape recorder for you to even 
decide if you want to use those 
works,” he said.

Bernard, who is legally blind, 

said HathiTrust provides imme-
diate accessibility to the books 
in its digitized collection and 
enlarges print in a way that 
makes accessing works efficient 
for him.

HathiTrust 
also 
provides 

people who cannot see at all the 
ability to listen to its books and 
read them in braille when using 
refreshable braille on their key-
boards.

“It’s amazing technology that 

enables these 13 million volumes 
to be available to the people 
who need them,” Bernard said. 
“Think about what this means 
for scholars, researchers, stu-
dents … anyone who has to inter-
act with an academic library 
really for the first time in his-
tory will have access to the full 
library, or at least in every part 
of the library that’s already been 
digitized.”

“It’s not that we couldn’t have 

digitized the books before, it’s 
that they’re already digitized, 
that they’re there and available 
just like they are to the aver-
age patron who walks into the 
library who wants to work,” he 
added. “The National Library 
for the Blind and Handicapped 
has somewhere between 25 and 
30 thousand digitized books. We 
have over 13 million digitized 
books. This is an enormous step 
forward that the University of 
Michigan heralded.”

Melissa Levine, the Univer-

sity’s lead copyright officer, said 
she was disappointed that the 
lawsuit was filed at all — con-
structive conversation, she said, 
would have been preferred.

“I am moved by the University 

of Michigan’s vision in creating 
HathiTrust, the vision that part-
nership represents, and the will-
ingness of the University to fight 
for principles of central value and 
interest to the academy,” Levine 
said. “The University’s commit-
ment to the principles at stake is 
inspiring — freedom of inquiry 
and the progress of knowledge, 
discovery as well as the funda-
mental need for preservation of 
the scholarly record in a way that 
makes possible access now and 
into the future.”

FILM COLUMN

Mark Wahlberg’s 
Worst of 2014 List

Mark Wahlberg’s latest declara-

tion that he has a penis, “The Gam-
bler,” debuted to middling reviews 
over Christmas break. In it, the 
former underwear model plays 
Jim 
Bennett, 

a debt-riddled 
literature pro-
fessor 
who, 

between 
inspired 
ser-

mons 
on 

Shake-speahh 
and 
lectures 

to his students 
about 
how 

they’re shitty 
writers, casu-
ally boondog-
gles faculty checks at a Roulette 
table. Things are good until they 
aren’t. And “When sorrows come, 
they come not single spies / But 
in battalions.” With a bald John 
Goodman breathing down his 
neck, “Good Vibrations” must pay 
off any outstanding funds before 
the week is out — or risk being 
beaten to death with a tire iron the 
size of Dirk Diggler’s schlong.

Whether or not you enjoy 

watching The Wahl expound on 
the values of well-crafted sen-
tences and punctuation marks 
in front of a lecture hall full of 
undergrads, you’ll probably agree 
with me when I say “The Gam-
bler” is just the capstone on a 2014 
marred by mediocrity for the for-
mer Oscar nominee. If not, please 
take a moment to think about why 
any year when the highlight reel 
starts and ends with a shot of you 
throwing up your arms to lacka-
daisically exclaim, “I think we just 
found a Transformer,” has certain 
… issues.

So, when I took a look back at 

the other big cinematic disappoint-
ments of the past 12 months, it only 
seemed natural to think, “What 
would Marky say?” After all, this 
is a guy who once got eviscerated 
on social media after claiming he 
could have stopped 9/11 had he 
been on one of the planes. This is 
the guy who got skinned on social 
media, again, after requesting that 
the governor of Massachusetts 
pardon him for the slew of hate 
crimes he committed 25 years ago. 
This is a guy who opens up HBO 
Go to watch “Entourage.”

If there’s anyone on this planet 

who is OK with disappointment, 
it’s Mr. Rhythm & Rhyme himself. 

So without further adieu, put your 
hands together for Mark Wahl-
berg, cluing us in on the biggest 
Hollywood letdowns of 2014:

1. “The Amazing Spider-

Man 2”

Honestly, when they gave that 

British pretty-boy the right to play 
Tobey Maguire, I knew shit was 
gonna hit the fan. I knew. Akshay, 
don’t look at me like that. I knew. 
The second the trailer ended, so 
I turned to my wife and I said, 
“Rhea, they gave that fucko Spider 
Man. Do they even have spiders in 
England? This can never work.” I 
mean, why not just get Tobey? He 
has that fuckin’ hair. He has those 
eyes. He has it all. I am aware he’s 
a vegan, but I heard on “Regis & 
Kelly” once that all those soy pat-
ties are great for the ass. This was a 
case of classic miscasting, Akshay. 
Why the hell was Jamie Foxx 
here? If I want to be electrified by 
Jamie Foxx, I’ll put on “Intuition.”

2. “Transcendence”

Akshay, I don’t know how the 

Internet works. I’m no genius. Is 
it a bunch of pipes that we shoot 
emails through? I don’t know. Is 
it like a giant inflatable pool in the 
yard that everyone jumps in dur-
ing a barbecue? Everyone’s peeing 
in it. I don’t know. What I do know 
is that Johnny Depp is not the 
Internet. The script is all wrong, 
Akshay. If you’re going to have one 
guy take over all facets of technol-
ogy, he wouldn’t be going after 
America. He’d be going after the 
Taliban. Have you seen my movie 
“Lone Survivor?” That’s where 
he’d be. If Johnny Depp was the 
Internet, porn wouldn’t be as good, 
I can tell you that much. Wally 
Pfister didn’t see all these angles. 
He’s a cinematographer, but he 
still didn’t see all the angles. What 
are you gonna do?

3. “Let’s Be Cops”

Hey, I get it — we all played that 

game when we were kids. Act like 
you’re the fuzz, maybe run around 
as cops and robbers a little. You got 
the pretend gun, the handcuffs. 
Not me. Donnie and I used to beat 
up little Asian kids at the grocery 
store. Then these blue assheads 
show up and put me in jail. It was a 
horrible experience and it’s been 25 
years since it happened. I’ve apolo-
gized for it. I wrote the fucking let-
ter, but they won’t let it go. It’s on 
them. I hate the police, Akshay. I 
hate everything about the law. I’m 

sorry, I’m getting off topic, but I get 
emotional — I’m from Boston. The 
thing is, you already have enough 
of these doughnut-eating shits 
out there. Do you really need to 
have two more assholes harassing 
everybody? It’s just an off-putting 
premise. No one wanted to see it, 
and I think it shows.

4. North Korea

When I heard what they did, 

I cried. I locked myself in the 
bedroom and I sobbed for two 
hours, because I knew this great 
country would never be the same 
again. What if these sick fuckers 
take down the HBO Go page? I 
can’t have them releasing Jeremy 
Piven’s emails, Akshay, that guy is 
an animal. When I came back out, 
my eyes were bleary and my nose 
was runny and my forehead was 
bleeding for some reason — but 
I knew what I had to do. Do you 
know what I did, Akshay? I called 
up Doug Ellin and I told him we’d 
have to add a North Korea subplot 
to the “Entourage” movie. That’s 
right, you heard it here first, you 
freeloaders — Vinny and the boys 
are headed to Pyonyang this sum-
mer, and we’re going to finish what 
Seth Rogen started. We’re going to 
show up at Un’s crib and demand 
some real answers. I’m from the 
street. This is what we do.

5. “Transformers: Age of 

Extinction”

I’ll admit it. It wasn’t a good 

year for the “Transformers” odys-
sey. Michael Bay told us straight 
up that it would be a tough, tough 
shoot and an even tougher post-
production phase, but we didn’t 
listen. We’d show up for work, we’d 
goof around all day and one time, 
I even knocked a guy out with a 
wrench. I threw it at him and it 
hit him in the face. He went right 
the fuck out. I must’ve laughed 
for two hours, but Michael wasn’t 
too happy about it. I get that. Half 
of the days, I didn’t even know my 
lines. It seems really polished now, 
but that scene in which I find a 
Transformer in my truck was pure 
improv — no planning. The movie’s 
a fucking mess, but we’ll always 
have that little gem. It’ll be in our 
back pockets, sitting there when 
we start shooting the fifth one.

partner. To help him pick,

TV NOTEBOOK
Intense ‘Apprentice’ 

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

There is something incredibly 

exciting about seeing celebrities 
out of context. It’s like seeing a 
teacher at the 
gym — nylon 
shorts, 
Nikes 

pounding on a 
grimy 
tread-

mill belt, real-
life sweat. You 
realize that Dr. 
Kimbob 
rips 

out bicep curls 
and 
Professor 

Loopy Lulaney 
rides the spin 
cycle like a sea-
soned pro. In 
“The Celebrity 
Apprentice,” now airing its sev-
enth season on NBC, 16 C-list 
celebrities are plucked out of 
their niches — whether that be 
reality TV, Hollywood, a sports 
field or the newsroom — and are 
thrown into the entrepreneurial 
world, all with the goal of fund-
raising for their chosen charities. 
And they aren’t fishing for money 
in just any pocket. The celebs 
have a boss with a hefty wallet: 
business tycoon himself, Donald 
Trump.

Each week, the men’s and 

women’s teams designate a Proj-
ect Manager, and under his or 
her guidance (or lack thereof), 
the teams compete in a series 
of tasks around New York City, 
ranging from baking pies to 
directing 
commercials. 
The 

contestants must tap into their 
business-savvy, past experiences 

and occasionally their famous 
contacts for fundraising. And 
they have to cooperate with 
each other — super-sized egos 
and all. At the end of the day, the 
teams assemble before Trump 
in a boardroom and the winning 
team is announced. Trump then 
whittles down the losers, crack-
ing questions and listening to 
celebrities’ accusations, until the 
contestant who is most respon-
sible for the team’s loss emerges. 
Then, at the height of the drama, 
Trump “fires” the incompetent 
celeb from the show.

The cast is definitely stacked 

with characters: eldest Jonas 
Brother Kevin Jonas, Olympi-
ans Shawn Johnson and Jamie 
Anderson; former athletes Ter-
rell Owens and Johnny Damon; 
comedian Gilbert Gottfried; TV 
personalities Geraldo Rivera and 
Leeza Gibbons; actors Lorenzo 
Lamas (“Renegade”), Ian Ziering 
(“Sharknado”) and Sig Hansen 
(“Deadliest Catch”); reality star 
Kate Gosselin (“Jon and Kate 
Plus 8”); “Real Housewives” 
Kenya Moore and Brandi Glan-
ville; and finally actresses Kei-
sha Pulliam (“The Cosby Show”) 
and Vivica Fox (“Kill Bill”). The 
women 
collectively 
became 

“Team Infinity,” while the men 
labeled themselves “Team Vor-
tex.”

After they made introduc-

tions and decided team names (a 
ridiculously drawn-out ordeal), 
Trump administered the first 
task of the season: to bake a sweet 
and a savory pie to be judged by 
“The Cake Boss” himself, Buddy 
Valastro. The real winner wasn’t 

who had the best pies, however. 
The challenge was primarily a 
fundraiser, so the teams had to 
sell their pastries and whichever 
team raised the most money — in 
pie profits and donations — won. 
So really, the trick was to have 
the most rich friends on speed 
dial.

Knowing this, Geraldo Rivera 

snagged Project Manager for 
Team Vortex and began calling 
up his wealthy buds while the rest 
of the team baked (and burned, 
as a distraught Kevin Jonas dis-
covered) their pies. Cosby-kid 
Keisha confidently headed Team 
Infinity, though she floundered, 
failing to bring in any substantial 
checks and refusing to ask Papa 
Bill for money.

Where the women fell behind 

in the money race, they triumphed 
in the taste department (to the 
chagrin of business women every-
where), wowing Buddy with their 
unique blueberry-pear pie. Moth-
er-of-eight Kate Gosselin pounced 
on kitchen duty, claiming that 
baking for the masses was second 
nature: “I make three meals a day 
for nine people!” Bless her heart.

Though Buddy gave a $25,000 

bonus check for the best tasting 
pie, Team Infinity still lost the 
challenge, raising only $93,862 
to Vortex’s whopping $185,322. 
In a tense, teary boardroom, 
Trump fired Keisha because of 
her 
unsatisfactory 
leadership 

skills, but compensated by donat-
ing $25,000 to her charity. The 
lessons learned? Don’t bake with 
Kevin Jonas. Do call Bill Cosby. 
And if you must be fired, let Don-
ald Trump do the firing.

Pantsuits and bold 
style at 2015 Globes

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Arts Writer

In my family, gathering to 

watch award shows has been 
something of a cult ritual since 
I was old enough to appreci-
ate celebrity obsession. The 
Oscars, the Grammys, the Gold-
en Globes — we sit around eat-
ing copious amounts of food, 
vehemently judging every per-
former, presenter, celebrity and 
security guard in sight. In addi-
tion to the jokes, the tipsy celeb-
rities, the concerning amount of 
selfie sticks, there is the fashion 
and the style. Sunday’s Golden 
Globes did not disappoint in 
this department. The trends of 
the evening seemed to be more 
skewed than usual, but it gave 
us style-obsessed people at 
home more to swoon over.

Metallic

Everyone knows the red car-

pet is a place to make a state-
ment. What better way to do 
that than by donning head to 
toe in a shimmer? That’s right, 
metallic was all over the red 
carpet.

To single out a few of the top 

looks: Jennifer Lopez stunned, 
looking like the ultimate domi-
natrix in Zuhair Murad (while 
also having the longest nip slip 
of the century). In the words of 
Jeremy Renner, it simply was 
the night for her and her “gold-
en globes.”

Golden Globe winner Juli-

anne Moore wore a fitted shim-
mering Givenchy by Riccardo 
Tisci gown that cinched with 
ombred feathers toward the 
bottom. Diane Kruger glim-
mered in her dress, between 
swigs of champagne, of course. 
There to support her was long-
time bae Joshua Jackson (the 
cutest couple at the Globes FYI), 
who showed off her impeccable 
style in Emilia Wickstead (fre-
quented by HRH Kate Middle-
ton, so you know she’s legit).

Monochromatic Color

Another trend all over the 

red carpet was bold minimal-
ism. We saw many monochro-
matic looks: an outfit of one 
solid color throughout. Accom-
panied with a structured fit, 
there are no frills, no fuss, just 

simplistically clean color. This 
theme produced looks that were 
the most elegant — the most 
couture.

In line with this theme was 

Taylor Schilling in a bright red 
Ralph Lauren ball gown with 
a halter neckline (a big step up 
from the green nightgown she 
wore last year). “The Theory 
of Everything” actress Felicity 
Jones may not have snatched up 
the Golden Globe, but she was 
#winning at fashion. She had on 
a teal Dior gown fit for a queen 
and perfect for the red carpet. 
The piece had a high collar, but 
buttoned detail down the back, 
a fit and flare that was every-
thing.

As two ladies whose out-

fits are always on-point, Amy 
Adams and Kate Hudson both 
opted for a monochromatic 
look but with more muted, 
neutral 
colors. 
They 
both 

donned Versace, making state-
ments in more ways than one. 
Adams wore a one-shouldered 
periwinkle gown and Hudson 
added sex appeal with a skin-
tight, icy-white cut-out dress. 
She looked so hot that even Jen-
nifer Aniston took a second to 
grab her ass before an interview 
with Ryan Seacrest. (Don’t act 
like you didn’t notice).

Pantsuits and Tuxedos and 

Jumpsuits, Oh my!

While it wasn’t a trend that 

was as prevalent as the others 
mentioned, perhaps one of the 
most understated themes of the 
night was the revival of the pant-
suit, and no, I’m not talking about 
Prince’s (although he looked fly 
as hell with his outfit and cane). 
I am more or less referring to 
my spirit animals: Lorde, Emma 
Stone and Tina Fey.

Lorde was in a custom-made 

Narciso Rodriguez piece. Not 
just an ordinary pantsuit though 
— she rocked a low-cut, elegant 
crop-top, frosted in a shit-ton of 
diamonds. She was clearly one of 
the chicest and youngest (if we 
aren’t counting Quvenzhané Wal-
lis) people nominated.

Emma Stone showed up with 

her (... interesting ...) brother, 
wearing 
a 
Lanvin 
jumpsuit 

embellished with jewels along the 
top half. She paired the piece with 

black pants that sprouted the big-
gest black bow on the back. Nor-
mally, the rule of thumb is to steer 
clear of anything and everything 
with bows after the age of five, but 
she managed to make it work.

For those who stuck around for 

the entire show, Tina Fey’s second 
outfit change was into a glitter-
ing tux. Now deemed Tina “The 
Tuxedo” Fey, the suit was by far 
her best outfit of the night — and 
no doubt the most comfortable. 
Can pantsuits and tuxedos please 
come back forever? When styled 
right, it makes anyone and any-
thing high-fashion.

Nature made a comeback 

(or at least it tried)

Along with the some of 

the natural colors celebrities 
wore, there was a resurgence 
of embellishment in the form 
of flowers, butterflies and all 
things Mother Nature. While 
most of the trends on the carpet 
were to die for, others, like this 
one, not so much.

Sienna Miller was probably 

the only person to have bested 
this trend, in a low cut, floor-
length 
cream-colored 
Miu 

Miu gown, embroidered with 
flowers and mini crystals. She 
looked radiant. Not so for preg-
nant Keira Knightley, though, 
dressed in a Chanel dress (I 
know, who can go wrong in 
Chanel? Well …) that looked 
straight out of “Little House on 
the Prairie” — leaves, feathers 
and butterflies galore (even a 
tacky bracelet). I didn’t under-
stand this look, and I don’t want 
to, frankly. Claire Danes also 
embraced her inner Mother 
Nature with a Valentino dress 
that reminded me of two things: 
a DIY art project or a gross 
furry moth. Better luck next 
time, perhaps.

As the first award show of the 

year, the Globes sets a prece-
dent for trends and styles. Thus 
far, it was all about the details 
(Amal’s white gloves anyone?), 
while returning to style funda-
mentals. Basic colors, cuts and 
fits ruled the red carpet, much 
like in 2014. However the res-
urrection of all things pants 
has potential to turn any tacky 
prom outfit into coveted cou-
ture.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

HELP WANTED

Martin adjusting 
nicely to college

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Prior to the season, Michigan 

coach Red Berenson didn’t know 
what to expect from freshman 
defenseman Cutler Martin. And 
Martin didn’t know what to 
expect from himself, either.

Martin arrived in Ann Arbor 

having 
not 
played 
a 
game 

since December 2013, due to a 
concussion he suffered while 
playing with the Tri-City Storm 
in the United States Hockey 
League.

“When you miss half a season, 

you don’t know if you’ve improved 
or if you’ve gone backwards,” 
Berenson said.

Fast forward to this December, 

and Martin has become a catalyst 
of Michigan’s defense, registering 
nine points in 15 games. Last 
season, 
Michigan’s 
highest-

scoring defenseman tallied 15 
points throughout the entire 
campaign. Moreover, Martin has 
become the anchor of the third 
defensive unit.

This happened despite the lack 

of a consistent defensive partner. 
Unlike the top two defensive 
pairings — which haven’t been 
shuffled around — Martin hasn’t 
been able to play with a consistent 
partner.

Instead, Martin has been 

paired 
with 
a 
rotation 
of 

sophomore 
Nolan 
De 
Jong, 

freshman 
Sam 
Piazza 
and 

senior Mike Chiasson. But, to 
the surprise of some, it hasn’t 
affected his game. Martin says 
it’s because he keeps the game 
as simple as he can. Berenson 
agreed, and noted that’s why he 
warrants big minutes.

“We kept liking when Cutler 

was in,” Berenson said. “He was 
doing what we expected him to 

do. Now we see him as a player 
that should compete for ice time 
every night.”

His sound defensive game, 

though, isn’t the only thing 
keeping 
Berenson 
pleased. 

Martin has tallied three goals 
and nine assists, including the 
game-winning goal in overtime 
against then-No. 9 Minnesota 
and a goal against then-No. 5 
Michigan Tech in the Great 
Lakes Invitational.

That, too, has taken Martin 

aback. After all, he could barely 
remember the last time he 
produced consistent offense.

“Years and years ago,” Martin 

said. “I definitely don’t consider 
myself as an offensive player. 
I consider myself a shutdown 
defenseman. I think the points 
come hand in hand with working 
hard in practice.”

Added Berenson: “His offense 

is a surprise. He’s one player 
that has a knack to get his shot 
through. He gets his shot through 
quick, rather than overhandle it. 
So it’s been a pleasant surprise.”

Better yet, Martin hasn’t 

reached his ceiling. He knows 
that, and so do his coaches. 
But with the addition of Mike 
Komisarek, a former Wolverine 
defenseman 
and 
NHL 
All-

Star, to the coaching staff, 
Martin will have an easier time 
improving.

“Every time I get off the ice, I 

like to sit next to him and pick his 
head and learn something from 
him,” Martin said. 

Komisarek will be especially 

helpful when it comes to offen-
sive production from the blue 
line. After all, in the 2001-02 sea-
son, Komisarek led all Wolverine 
defensemen in points.

One day, Martin might be able 

to say the same about himself.

ICE HOCKEY

Arnone readying for MLS

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

The past month has been 

hectic for Tyler Arnone.

The former Michigan soccer 

player has been all over the East 
Coast, playing soccer day in and 
day out. But he’s not playing just 
for fun. Tuesday morning, he 
concluded the five-day Adidas 
Major League Soccer Player 
Combine in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida. The goal of the 55 college 
prospects at the combine is to 
perform well enough to impress 
the scouts and get drafted.

Arnone, 
though, 
had 
an 

advantage. Prior to the combine, 
he got a brief taste of professional 
soccer. He drove straight from 
his last final exam to Columbus, 
where 
he 
trained 
with 
the 

Columbus Crew. After a four-hour 
session with the Crew, he got on a 
plane to Philadelphia, where he 
received a similar evaluation from 
the Philadelphia Union.

The key component of these 

evaluations was the physical 
tests: 
the 
40-meter 
dash, 

agility drills and the vertical 
jump. While he only stayed in 
Columbus for a few hours, he 
trained with Philadelphia for 
three days.

“We 
would 
train 
in 
the 

morning 
and 
play 
in 
the 

afternoon for three straight days, 
so that was a little more tasking 
physically,” Arnone said. “I did 
pretty well. They even brought 
that up here at the combine when 
I met with them.”

Once the holiday break had 

passed, it was time to head 
down south to the combine. 
Upon 
arriving, 
one 
of 
the 

biggest 
changes 
for 
Arnone 

was the professionalism of the 
atmosphere.

While the combine was based 

around playing soccer, for the 
players, it was much more. Every 
other day was a rest day, during 
which the players learned about 
other aspects of their future 
careers.

“We’d 
have 
meetings 

throughout 
the 
rest 
days,” 

Arnone said. “We met with the 
Players Union. We met with 
different people from around the 
MLS. We even had a financial 
meeting, kind of just to educate 

us young players not to blow all 
our money on our first paycheck. 
It was really informational and 
very professional.”

One of the most important 

components of the combine was 
the individual meetings, which 
became swtressful for many of 
the players, especially since clubs 
only offer interviews to specific 
players they are interested in.

Fortunately for the former 

Wolverine, multiple clubs showed 
interest. Over the course of the 
combine, Arnone had individual 
meetings with the Crew, New 
York City F.C., Real Salt Laake 
and the Union.

“They kind of pick your brain a 

little bit,” Arnone said. “They get 
to know you as a person. They ask 
you about your background and 
what you like to do. They want to 
know, since they may potentially 
draft you, who they’re bringing 
into their locker room. A bunch 
of character-type questions, and 
then they’d ask you about the 
game. Where do you think your 
best spot is? What do you think 
your strengths are? Some of your 
weaknesses or things you need 
to improve on? Performance as 
well as personal questions.”

While the clubs did make a 

point to ensure they’d bring in 
good personalities, the actual 

on-field performances ultimately 
make the biggest difference, 
and Arnone felt he had a strong 
showing.

Even though Arnone didn’t 

show up on the stat sheet much, 
he consistently produced many 
contributing plays for his team. 
He took nearly every free kick 
and corner kick, looked to make 
connecting passes instead of 
attempting to take on defenders 
one-on-one, 
organized 
the 

midfield and did all the dirty 
work that coaches want to 
see out of defensive-minded 
midfielders.

“Each day, I didn’t score goals, 

but that wasn’t my job,” Arnone 
said. “I thought I had three 
solid days because I connected 
well, possessed the ball well 
and tackled well. I got a lot of 
feedback about my fitness. A lot 
of teams were impressed with 
how fit I was.”

The MLS SuperDraft begins 

Thursday 
afternoon 
and 
is 

composed of four rounds. The 
final two take place Jan. 20.

Whatever 
the 
outcome, 

Arnone knows he did everything 
in his power. He met the coaches, 
battled the competition and 
made his case.

Now all that’s left to do is 

wait.

‘M’ present and past unite

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

As the Michigan women’s 

basketball team ran out of the 
locker room for the second half 
of its game against Ohio State 
on Sunday, the Wolverines ran 
by a human tunnel comprised 
of past Michigan players, some 
from Team One and others who 
graduated just two years ago.

It was Alumni Day at Crisler 

Center, 
and 
the 
program’s 

graduates were back to not 
only be honored at a halftime 
ceremony, but also to support 
the current team.

While all of the alumni don’t 

play on the court anymore, they 
have gone on to have successful 
careers in other fields because 
of “the 40-year plan” and the 
opportunities that a Michigan 
degree has opened up for them 
outside of basketball. The plan 
is one of the tools Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico has in 
her arsenal when she talks to 
potential recruits.

Sunday, she had her examples 

right in front of her. Take 
Jennifer McLogan, who was a 
member of Team One back in 
1971. McLogan is now a news 
reporter for CBS in New York.

But without having gone to 

Michigan, she may have never 
gone down that career path.

“I thought I was going to 

go to Broadway,” McLogan, 

who was a theatre major, said. 
“I never knew or dreamed I 
would be a news reporter, but 
my professors engaged me in 
politics, religion, history and 
everything else, and you start 
to become a sponge and want to 
branch out.”

And 
for 
many 
former 

Wolverines, 
that’s 
exactly 

what made Michigan stand out 
during their recruiting process. 
It’s what makes the Michigan 
experience 
for 
the 
players, 

something that’s more than 
women’s basketball.

“(Academics) 
was 
a 
big 

deciding factor,” said former 
player Sam Arnold, who played 
for the Wolverines from 2008-
2012 and is currently a graduate 
student 
at 
Loyola-Chicago. 

“Being the best on the court, 
and in the classroom — that’s 
why Michigan was a top choice 
for me.”

The evidence of the program’s 

message continued down the 
line of former players at the 
game.

“Because everything is so 

structured and we have to be 
places at a certain time, and we 
have away and home games, you 
have to be able to balance school 
life and your basketball life,” said 
Janelle Cooper, who is currently 
in the University’s dental school 
and played for Michigan from 
2004 to 2008. “So now that I’m 
in dental school, even with all of 

the classes, I’m able to balance 
things very well because I had 
to do it as an undergrad.”

Members 
of 
older 
teams 

— such as Team One — who 
received little to no help from 
the Athletic Department, had 
other responsibilities as well.

“We wore our game uniforms 

from home to the game and 
back,” said Team One member 
Sheryl Szady. “We washed our 
own uniforms, and there were 
no practice uniforms.”

Times are different now. 

Women’s players share facilities 
with the men. But still, the 
program remains united today.

A strong showing of alumni 

at the game echoed Cooper’s 
sentiments on the value of a 
Michigan degree as well as 
participation in the women’s 
basketball program.

“I think 29 or 30 players 

came back this weekend, and 
that shows the greatness of 
the program and the strength 
of Michigan,” McLogan said. 
“Everyone wants to be affiliated 
and stay affiliated.”

While the alumni who came 

back for Alumni Day all didn’t 
play under the same coach or 
even in the same gym, each and 
every player graduated from 
Michigan and has moved onto 
bigger and better things outside 
of basketball.

And that’s the meaning of the 

40-year plan.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


For 20 minutes, Ohio State 

pounded the Michigan men’s 
basketball team. The Buckeyes 
forced out sophomore point 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. with 
two 
early 

fouls, 
then 

went 
to 

work on a 
backcourt of 
junior Spike 
Albrecht and 
freshman 
Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman.

They 

scored, 
forced turnovers and scored 
some more. They opened up a 
15-point lead at halftime.

And then things got ugly.
Not only did the deficit 

increase — Ohio State went on a 
13-0 run to open the second half 
and pull ahead 52-24 — but the 
cut ran deeper.

Late in the game, the out-

come long since decided, a fan in 
the student section unveiled an 
“NJIT Basketball” shirt, reopen-
ing memories of the Wolver-
ines’ embarrassing Dec. 6 loss. 
A moment later, the students 
started chanting “Just Like 
Football!” reminding the crowd 
of Ohio State’s rivalry win over 
Michigan, to say nothing of the 
Buckeyes’ national title victory 
24 hours earlier.

Lessons don’t come as much 

from games like the Wolverines’ 
Dec. 13 blowout loss at Arizona, 
after which Beilein said it would 
have taken many games for 
Michigan to beat the Wildcats. 
They don’t come from home 
upsets by NJIT or Eastern Mich-
igan. They come on the road in 
cavernous Big Ten arenas when 
the crowd starts to file out with 
6:57 left.

This wasn’t like any of those 

December losses. The Wolver-
ines knew then that they were a 
learning, improving team. Com-
ing into Columbus at 3-1 in the 

Big Ten, they might have expect-
ed better this time.

In the end, Michigan tidied up 

the deficit and lost by 19, three 
points fewer than the margin 
between the Ohio State football 
team and Oregon a night earlier.

But the Buckeyes weren’t try-

ing to hammer the Wolverines 
by that many.

“No, we were trying to win 

by 50,” said senior forward Sam 
Thompson. “That didn’t work 
out. We just wanted to send a 
message.”

Early in the second half, as 

the deficit piled up and that 
message became clearer, Ohio 
State forward Amir Williams 
blocked 
Michigan 
freshman 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman on a drive. The Buck-
eyes’ Marc Loving grabbed the 
rebound.

And then Ohio State started 

the fast break.

At the other end, Thompson 

found Shannon Scott for an easy 
layup, plus a foul on the Wol-
verines’ Kameron Chatman, a 
freshman forward.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

sat back in his chair with his 
hand on his chin, watching as 
his young team took a beating. 
The Buckeyes were putting on a 
clinic, and he wanted his team 
to witness every painful second.

“Every loss stings me the 

same way — just talking per-
sonally, I don’t know about 
the team,” Beilein said. “We 
grow from it — that’s it. We 
grow from it. By the time we 
get home, I’ll have watched the 
whole game, and we’ll try to 
find some answers to what we 
could do better.”

The Buckeyes showed pass-

ing 
when 
freshman 
guard 

D’Angelo Russell fed a no-
look dish to Williams for an 
open dunk in the first minute. 
They showed X’s and O’s when 
Thompson got open for an easy 
jumper off an inbounds pass 
with 10 minutes to go in the 

first half. They showed quick-
ness when they scored a layup 
with 5:18 left, then immediately 
stole the inbounds pass and laid 
it back in for two.

They 
showed 
interior 

defense when Williams swat-
ted a shot halfway to the state 
border in the second half. They 
showed perimeter defense with 
11 steals, five by Thompson and 
four by Russell. They showed 
alertness in the first few min-
utes when Walton lobbed an 
alley-oop pass to freshman for-
ward Ricky Doyle, only to have 
it knocked away by Russell.

The beating was far from 

over. Beilein’s first substitution 
was Abdur-Rahkman for Wal-
ton at the 16:37 mark of the first 
half. Abdur-Rahkman played 
a career-high 15 minutes, usu-
ally guarded by either Russell 
or Scott, one of Ohio State’s six 
seniors.

For Abdur-Rahkman and the 

other freshmen, the game was a 
baptism by fire, one that start-
ed with the pregame fireworks 
during 
Ohio 
State’s 
player 

introductions and lasted until 
the final buzzer.

The 
Buckeyes 
outplayed 

Michigan’s regulars and preyed 
on its inexperienced reserves.

“We were trying to send 

(a message) from the jump,” 
Thompson said. “No matter 
what lineup they had on the 
floor, no matter what lineup we 
had on the floor, we wanted to 
show that we were the better 
team, and we wanted to do it 
decisively.”

Mission accomplished.
The Wolverines won’t own 

this rivalry this season as they 
did last year. With memories 
of a loss, a T-shirt and a chant, 
they’re headed back home.

But it’s a good thing Beilein 

didn’t let them leave with 6:57 
left, like the fans did. They 
might have missed an impor-
tant lesson.

The old wounds are open 

again. Now it’s about how fast 
Michigan can close them.

BUCKEYE BLITZ

OHIO STATE, 71

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

COLUMBUS — It was far 

from the typical raucous envi-
ronment one comes to expect 
at a major Michigan-Ohio State 
sporting event Tuesday night.

“The last two times we came 

in here, one time we were unde-
feated (and then) last year, you 
couldn’t hear yourself think,” 
said Michigan basketball coach 
John Beilein. “It was just quiet 
from the beginning.”

With a contingency of Buck-

eye supporters still on their 
way back from college football’s 
National Championship in Dal-
las on Monday and an entire 
segment of the student section 
empty, Value City Arena seemed 
nothing like the hostile venue 
Michigan has known it to be 
over the years.

But even with seemingly 

friendlier confines, the Wolver-
ines (3-2 Big Ten, 10-7 overall) 
fell flat, losing 71-52.

“From the very beginning, it 

was a little different than what 
I was expecting,” said junior 
guard Spike Albrecht. “Because 
usually at Ohio State, it’s a big 
rivalry, they jump out at you — 
all the rah-rah and things like 
that — but they didn’t do that. 
We just kind of coasted along 
with them for the first four min-
utes and then I just felt like we 
stayed in that coast mode for the 
first half, and they picked it up. 
We just didn’t match it.”

Uncharacteristically 
for 

Michigan, foul trouble plagued 
its guards. The Wolverine back-
court of Albrecht and sopho-
more Derrick Walton Jr. picked 
up two first-half fouls apiece, 

as did junior swingman Caris 
LeVert. But with the deficit inch-
ing toward 15 points, Beilein was 
forced to keep both Albrecht 
and Walton Jr. in to counter the 
Buckeye onslaught at the end of 
the first half.

“I thought we had to,” Beilein 

said. “I thought all of a sudden it 
could get over 20. We had to try 
to withstand it. They were only 
in for three minutes. They were 
told not to foul, unless they felt 
(so). We wanted them to com-
pete. We rarely do that, but the 
flow of the game was very bad at 
that point.”

Desperate or not, Michigan 

seemed dead to begin the sec-
ond half, allowing Ohio State 
(3-2, 14-4) to open up on an 8-0 
run before finally calling time-
out with 15:15 left. At that point, 
following three turnovers and 
an alley-oop dunk by Ohio 
State forward Sam Thomp-
son, Beilein finally threw in 
the towel, inserting freshman 
guards Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman and Aubrey Dawkins, 
freshman forward Kameron 
Chatman and senior forward 
Max Bielfeldt.

Adding even more insult to 

injury, Michigan went until the 
13:25 mark of the second half 
before scoring its first points of 
the stanza, with the Buckeye run 
extending to 13-0. Thanks to a 
Bielfeldt basket, Michigan man-
aged to cut the lead to 26 — at 
the time, that number matched 
its point total.

“I think they’ve been down 

10-15 points every game in the 
last (several) games in the sec-
ond half,” said Ohio State for-
ward Sam Thompson. “We know 
they can come back to send it 

into overtime. We knew the 
game wasn’t over at halftime. 
We knew they were still very 
capable of making a run.”

But that run never came.
While the Wolverine back-

court 
struggled 
to 
stay 
in 

the game, Ohio State guard 
D’Angelo Russell’s play enabled 
the Buckeyes to pull away. Tal-
lying 21 points and six assists, 
the freshman helped spread the 
scoring for the Buckeyes, who 
had five other scorers with at 
least six points to go along with 
34 points in the paint.

Things didn’t start entirely 

terribly for Michigan, though. 
The Wolverines actually led 
14-13 after a Dawkins put-back. 
But after that basket, everything 
seemed to fall apart.

The Buckeyes went on a 25-9 

run over the final 12:02 of the 
first half, taking advantage of 
Michigan turnovers and sec-
ond-chance baskets to take a 
commanding 
39-24 
halftime 

lead, with Walton, the defender 
Michigan was determined to 
stick on Russell, playing just 
eight first-half minutes.

“Whether (Walton) is in foul 

trouble, it’s going to happen 
again,” Beilein said. “Our guys 
— he, Caris — they’re going to 
get in foul trouble. And we need 
to be able to get better off the 
bench.”

Even with the hushed crowd 

a non-factor, Michigan was con-
stantly outworked on the offen-
sive glass. Totaling 11 offensive 
rebounds, the Buckeyes out-
scored Michigan in second-
chance points, 13-7. Meanwhile, 
Michigan turned the ball over 
13 times, resulting in 19 Buckeye 
points off turnovers.

M

y older sister lost one of her 
best friends in a fatal car crash 

eight months ago. Grief in large 
and consuming proximity was not 
something I had much experience 
with until this year. The powerful 
denting it has done to someone who 
I am so close with is vexing. My own 
grief has become disoriented in my 

heartbreak for her struggle and has 
brought me piles of questions for 
the world beyond on our own world: 
heaven. 

My reasons, driven by what 

Sunday 
school 
teachers 
had 

plastered in my brain as common 

sense, were what I first turned 
to for answers. God needs her in 
heaven. She was better than human, 
immortal, meant for the life of an 
angel. We will be reunited with her 
one day.

Though 
these 
reasons 
are 

beautiful, they never fully settled 
with me. She was many things in 

this 
world 
that 

were 
grand 
and 

admirable, 
but 

deeming 
her 
a 

better 
human 
— 

as 
heaven 
and 

an 
angelic 
life 

appeared to do — 
seemed 
belittling 

of individual’s life 
here on Earth. 

According 

to a recent Pew 
Research 
Center 

survey, one-fifth of 
Americans 
today 

do 
not 
identify 

with any religion, 
some 
of 
the 

highest percentages ever recorded. 
However, of these 46 million 
unaffiliated adults, two-thirds say 
they believe in God, more than half 
say they have a connection with 
nature, a third of them classify 
themselves as “spiritual,” and one in 

five say they pray every day. 

Perennial philosophy offers a 

path of philosophy for those who are 
spiritually independent. According 
to the book “Perennial Wisdom 
for the Spiritually Independent” 
by Rami Shapiro, an author and 
Jewish 
Rabbi, 
the 
philosophy 

includes there is one reality and 
that reality can be called ‘God,’ 
individuals 
identify 
with 
“our 

culturally conditioned individual 
ego,” and that this identification 
leads to peace replacing anxiety 
and suffering. Humans should 
realize that their true nature is this 
manifestation of the single reality, 
God, and place responsibility and 
reason in themselves. 

Perennial 
wisdom 
and 
my 

struggles with my original answer 
to death collided when I read 
Shapiro stressed “to know God is to 
know yourself; to know yourself is 
to know God” and “knowing you are 
God is knowing everything else is 
God.” For individuals to truly know 
themselves they must recognize 
themselves as grand as God, and 
each person next to them, equally 
grand. 

Some 
find 
inspiration 
and 

guidance in God’s grace or heaven’s 
refuge, but after swimming through 
the ideas of perennial wisdom I find 

inspiration in the individual. We 
are each grand and living our most 
moral lives because of the humanity 
and goodness of the person sitting 
to the right and left of you. We are 
each capable of being what God 
is to each other, of providing that 
comfort. We are every part of our 

reality on Earth.

Though final answers might 

take a lifetime to find me, for this 
moment, honoring her best rests 
in honoring that we are worthy of 
each other, and that we are worthy 
of the world we are a part of, 
nothing more.

All the Pretty Things: The Snow

P

retty things this week: Snow.

I step out of the warm halls 

of East Quad and into the chilly 
streets on my way to class. I pass 
countless faces, each asking the 
same question: “Why, why am I 

being pelted by sharp, cold daggers 
of snow?” I differ from these folks, 
my face upturned to the sky and 
a smile on my face. Big, fluffy 
flakes falling from the sky begin 
to create a temporary wonderland 

in the Diag. I live for 
the snow. Call me 
basic, but it seems as 
though 
something 

magical 
happens 

when 
it 
snows. 
I 

am not even talking 
about how with snow 
comes the jolliness of 
the holiday season. 
No, snow is its own 
event that promises 
a 
certain 
cozy 

quietness. 
Campus 

becomes 
a 
little 

quieter, the students a 
little puffier.

Snow 
is 
the 

assurance that, “Yes, 

Jackie, you should stay inside 
tonight. Don’t go trudging to that 
dirty party over on Hill St.” Snow 
gives the permission to indulge in 
that second caramel brulée latte 
because it’s cold. And, I suppose 
I would be lying if I claimed 
the snow doesn’t conjure up the 
excitement of the holidays. It’s 
acceptable to listen to Charlie 
Brown’s Christmas album and 
wear snowflake-covered onesies 
to bed. The snow is the key to all 
things cozy and all things soft.

So, as I fall up the treacherous 

slippery steps at the Michigan 
Union in my pursuit of the Queen 
of Cozy, Starbucks, I don’t look to 
the snow gods and curse them, for 
this is only a small token I must 
pay for the feeling we all will get 
at least once while going to school 
in Michigan: the feeling of the first 
snow and all that it promises.

While there are a range of events and memorials being held 
this upcoming Monday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., 
here are a few ways to spend the other two days of the long 

weekend.

THE LIST

2. THE TOLEDO ZOO
While there may not be many wolverines found in this state, 
this zoo is one of the best in the country, hosting a wide range 
of wildlife and non-Midwestern habitats. And unlike other 
zoos, Toledo’s is open year-round. Only an hour outside of 
A2, this is a more adventurous option than watching “Brother 
Bear” again on Netflix.

GRAND RAPIDS 
ARTS MUSEUM
Though Grand Rapids can 
seem far (given its West 
side/best side status) 
this up-and-coming art 
museum is worth the two 
hour drive, named a 2014 
notable small art museum by The Wall Street Journal.

4. WEST LAKE NATURE PRESERVE
Southeastern Michigan can thank the glaciers for its relative 
flatness, but hikers still have found spots to break a sweat. 
The West Lake Nature Preserve, located in Chelsea, provides 
two miles of trails through wetlands, open fields and beautiful 
forests. This is the place to have your Cheryl Strayed moment.

BUZZFEED, BUT BETTER

FIVE DAY TRIPS FOR THE LONG 

WEEKEND

FRANKENMUTH
Michigan’s Little Bavaria 
— also known as the only 
Bavaria you will probably 
ever actually go to . The town 
is only an hour drive from A2 
and is great for an afternoon 
of old-timey fun.

HURON HILLS GOLF CLUB

Hear us out. While it may not be 
the ideal season to golf, one thing 
Michigan boasts an abundance 
of is snow. And what’s better on 
a snowy January Saturday than 
sledding? Whether with a trash-can 
lid or dining hall tray, sober or under 
the influence, all college students 
secretly love a good sled ride. Only 
ten minutes from campus, Huron 
Hills lives up to it’s name, providing 
hours of cheap fun.

“Our campus isn’t particularly good … The CO2 emissions that we put out per 

student is the highest in the Big 10. I did a project on it last year and that was pretty 
eye-opening to show how inefficient we can be at times … If we’re supposed to be 
the leaders and best and have all this income to be distributing, I feel like we should 

becoming more eco-friendly if we have the means to do so.”

efore 
transferring 

to the University of 
Michigan, Cody Gid-

dings — now a Public Policy 
junior — attended the United 
States Military Academy at 
West Point. As a Military 
Academy 
cadet, 
Giddings 

developed 
an 
interest 
in 

international security, in part 
through his interaction with 
professors, some of whom had 
experience gathering infor-
mation for military purposes.

At West Point, Giddings 

explored 
this 
interest 
by 

assisting on a security-related 
research project. The oppor-
tunity allowed him to develop 
a deep knowledge in subject 
areas pertinent to the safety 
of U.S. citizens — areas receiv-
ing a considerable increase in 
attention post-9/11 and that 
remain important today.

The 2001 terrorist attacks 

prompted 
a 
tangible 
and 

immediate shift in perspec-
tive on U.S. national secu-
rity. It also evidenced a gap 
between in the level of infor-
mation that the government 
had on terrorist activity and 
the level needed to keep the 
United States safe from other 
potential attacks.

Even after 14 years, the 

fear of a subsequent attack 
has not subsided to pre-9/11 
levels. According to a Gallup 
poll conducted in March 2014, 
39 percent of Americans were 
worried a “great deal” about 
future attacks.

The concern is justified, 

evidenced by more recent 
terrorist activity in both the 
United States and abroad — 
including 
targeted 
attacks 

in Paris against the satirical 
magazine “Charlie Hebdo.”

Efforts to combat such acts 

of terrorism require a host of 
information on the structure, 
dynamics and interactions of 
terrorist groups. While this 
knowledge is most often gath-
ered by state organizations 
such as the CIA, certain proj-
ects have been subcontracted 
to the University and various 
research institutes nation-
wide.

In 2011, for instance, the 

University received $62.7 mil-
lion in Defense Department 
funding. Though much of 
this funding went to projects 
based in the health and engi-
neering research, other areas 
of study, such as the social sci-
ences, make up a unique com-
ponent of the work going on at 
the University contributing to 

national security efforts.

DOD-funded social science 

research doesn’t just con-
tribute to national security 
efforts. These projects also 
provide 
student 
research-

ers with a unique opportu-
nity to develop research skills 
through real-world applica-
tions.

When Giddings transferred 

to the University, he assisted 
on a project focused on study-
ing the alliances between ter-
rorist organizations through 
the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program — a 
University program that helps 
underclassmen find jobs as 
research assistants in labs 
across campus. Philip Potter, a 
former public policy assistant 
professor, manages the proj-
ect in conjunction with the 
University of Denver and the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
Under the Defense Depart-
ment’s 
Minerva 
Initiative, 

which provides funding to 
universities for social science 
research, the project posed a 
unique opportunity to con-
tribute to national security 
by exploring the relationship 
dynamics of non-state violent 
actors.

“When I ended up deciding 

to leave, I wanted to be able 
to contribute more than I was 
at West Point,” Giddings said. 
“So that’s why I came here — 
because it was one of the big-
gest research universities in 
the world, and I knew that Dr. 
Potter had been putting some-
thing unique together, and I 
wanted to be a part of it.”

The project is unique in its 

attempt to collect and code 
data on every terrorist orga-
nization in the world in a cen-
tralized database. And it is the 
first effort to do so, according 
to Rackham Student Isaac 
Jenkins, a graduate student 
manager for the project.

Students 
working 
on 

the project are tasked with 
researching and coding infor-
mation on the interactions and 
relationships between various 
violent non-state actions, and 
in doing so, develop a deep 
knowledge of the politics of 
terrorism.

“I have seen students in our 

group meetings who are far 
more knowledgeable on ter-
rorist organization, and rebel 
group alliances and relation-
ship dynamics than almost 
anyone else,” Jenkins said. 
“Students that are working on 
this project have developed 

expertise. It’s actually quite 
extraordinary.”

Students working on the 

project were exposed to the 
methods and dynamics of 
social science research, allow-
ing them to not only learn 
about the various terrorist 
organizations that they were 
researching, but also their 
academic discipline.

For LSA sophomore Erin 

Eusebi, who also came to the 
project through UROP, this 
academic element was espe-
cially important. She said her 
experience on the project has 
contributed to her current 
interest in pursuing a gradu-
ate degree in political science 
and a career in research by 
allowing her to see the ways in 
which academic research can 
bring different perspectives to 
issues of national security.

Through her work, Euse-

bi was also able to connect 
with a mentor, who provided 
information on pursuing an 
advanced degree.

Psychology 
Prof. 
James 

Jackson, director of the Uni-
versity’s Institute for Social 
Research, said undergraduate 
researchers involved in social 
science projects often have 
the opportunity to grow in 

both their research and writ-
ing skills. These roles can 
allow for significant develop-
ment, and some experienced 
undergraduate 
researchers 

may even assist with analyses 
or paper writing on their proj-
ects.

Those working on projects 

designed to help contribute to 
national security seem to have 
an additional benefit — the 
opportunity to contribute to 
research that they personally 
find impactful.

“It’s often hard, especially 

on defense projects, to see the 
full impact you’re having,” 
Giddings said. “I do know that 
just coming from West Point 
and knowing people who 
were currently in Afghanistan 
and Iraq that I was personal 
friends with … every bit, detail 
helps, every piece of informa-
tion can save someone’s life … 
It’s projects like this that are 
going to support efforts that 
we have going on abroad.”

However, not every social 

science project designed to 
promote security is related to 
terrorism.

This past year, the Defense 

Department awarded more 
than $2.4 million in funding to 

T

he 
army-adminis-

tered backpack slung 
over Nursing Senior 

Autumn Augustine’s shoul-
ders wasn’t the only item that 
signaled her role as a Reserve 
Officer Training Corp stu-
dent.

Augustine arrived at 12:00 

p.m. on the dot. Her punc-
tuality, firm handshake and 
straight posture indicated her 
trained discipline.

In ROTC at the University 

since her freshman year, she 
rose through various leader-
ship roles in her career. This 
semester marks her new role 
as battalion commander, the 
highest leadership position 
available to students in the 
program.

Augustine said she initially 

joined ROTC largely because 
of 
its 
financial 
benefits 

regarding tuition. Through 
a School of Nursing scholar-
ship, the army paid for her 
schooling.

“It started off as a means 

to pay for school. I wanted 
to go to Michigan and then 
I thought ‘Wow this sounds 
like a really great opportu-
nity,’” Augustine said. “And 
then I got into it and I loved it. 
I love the people I met. I love 
the culture. It’s been a great 
experience.”

The U.S. Army requires 

all individuals interested in 
staff positions to complete a 
four-year bachelor’s degree 
before starting off as a second 
lieutenant, the first officer 
rank. There are three routes 
that can be taken to become 
an officer: joining ROTC, 
attending a military academy, 
or completing the intensive 
Officer Candidate School pro-
gram.

The ROTC is a four-year 

program at a non-military 
university that allows inter-
ested students to achieve both 
a bachelor’s degree and a mili-
tary sciences education simul-

taneously. 
ROTC 
students 

at the University are offered 
scholarships 
and 
monthly 

stipends in return for meet-
ing certain obligations during 
their time in the program.

Students in ROTC are not 

referred to by academic years, 
but by their military science 

years. A freshman in ROTC, 
for instance, would be called 
an MS1.

All students in the organi-

zation are required to attend 
an hour-long physical train-
ing class three times a week at 
the CCRB and a two-hour lab. 
Juniors teach lab classes for 
freshmen and sophomores, 
while seniors run classes on 
their own.

The most pivotal year for 

a military science student is 
junior year, where students 
are now required to attain at 
least one leadership position.

“The third year is more of 

your leadership capstone,” 
Augustine said. “You’re learn-
ing a lot about tactics and are 
also in roles such as platoon 

leader, platoon sergeant and 
squad leader. You have a 
direct role in the organiza-
tion and you’re facilitating the 
training, so junior year is kind 
of a big step.”

Augustine, in her own 

junior year, held three differ-
ent leadership positions: pla-
toon sergeant, squad leader, 
and executive officer under a 
previous battalion command-
er. Her promotion to battal-

ion commander was the next 
natural step.

As platoon sergeant and 

squad leader, Augustine led 
her peers through battle drills 
in the Nichols Arboretum as 
part of previous lab experi-
ences.

“We’d have a two hour lab 

where we would be running 
a mission as a squad or run-
ning a mission as a platoon,” 
she said. “You start off with 
building up with squad tactics 
and then you shift into pla-
toon and patrolling tactics in 
the winter semester.”

But in her new role as bat-

talion commander, Augustine 
serves as the face of the orga-
nization — and her cadre, or 
staff — as a whole.

“Everything that happens 

with the battalion, whether 
good or bad, rests on my 
shoulders,” she said. “I’m the 
one that ultimately answers to 
our cadre for that.”

Answering to the ROTC 

cadre, high-ranking military 
officials, is immense pressure 

for a student.

Added Augustine: “That’s 

the way it should be.”

She manages her own staff, 

comprised of her fellow peers, 
who brief her on everyday 
issues cadets are facing or 
possible changes that may 
need to be addressed.

Notably, Augustine is the 

only woman in her staff. 
ROTC itself is largely male. 
But Augustine said she does 

not feel any prejudice against 
her because of her gender and 
has always been welcome by 
her peers.

“I’ve never felt like I’ve 

been excluded because I’m a 
female,” she said. “Everyone 
treats each other the same. We 
all have that ability to make a 
lot of friendships with each 
other. I might have to be a lit-
tle bit more firm sometimes, 
just because I am a female as 
opposed to male, but there’s 
no animosity between us for 
sure.”

Rather, challenge rather, 

she said, will be leading her 
peers — the atmosphere is 
much different with her inter-
action with them inside the 
organization versus outside.

“That’s one thing that 

makes it hard,” Augustine 
said. “It’s your peers that 
you’re leading as opposed to 
strangers.”

Kinesiology student Jordan 

Macocha, her executive offi-
cer and battalion commander, 
said she is a hands-on leader, 
invests effort into her work 
and is receptive to ideas, but 
is “by no means a push-over.”

“She’s not just going to 

stand back and let some-
thing run and pat you on the 
back and say ‘Hey, good job,’” 
Macocha said. “If she sees 
something where she believes 
you can be improved or has 
an idea, she’s going to let you 
know and that’s a good thing.”

Augustine said she plans 

on partnering with Team 
Red, White and Blue, a vet-
eran nonprofit organization, 
and hosting STEM events 
in southeast Michigan high 
schools with JROTCs in her 
final semester as a University 
student and military sciences 
leader.

“These aren’t ideas that 

just 
happened 
overnight,” 

Macocha said. “She spent a lot 
of time preparing for this role

A

ll I felt was pain. I couldn’t breath. It felt as if some-
one had pulled my voice box out of my throat to its 
maximum, only to let go and have it spring back as 

if it were a plastic slinky.

I felt tears collapse around my eyes, but they might as 

well have been tears of joy.

Eating, purging, living. For five years, I was living 

through a binding cycle.

I don’t remember what made me start. All I know is that 

once I had begun, I could not stop. I remember waking up 
six months later and seeing someone completely different 
in the mirror. And it felt good.

You are so lucky.
That was all I needed to hear. Months of wiping my sys-

tem clean of fats, sugars and nutrients, and I had reached 
the point where my friends were envious of my body — scot-
free.

I should have realized things were too good to be true. 

I vaguely remember passing out on multiple occasions. I 
remember liking it. Just the mere sight of food disgusted 
me, and watching people eat infuriated me.

My metabolism must have slowed dramatically, because 

not long after, I hit the point where a lack of food didn’t 
affect me. But even a tinge of it did. After one full meal, in 
my mind, it was as if numbers on the scale had shot up. My 
days were dominated by trying to retain food in my system 
without reverting back to who I had been before. Because I 
would rather do anything than take a step back when I had 
worked so hard.

People stopped complimenting me. People called me 

sick.

That’s the thing: I didn’t purge to prove something to 

them. I purged to prove something to myself. I wanted to 
prove to myself that I could be beautiful. For so long, so 
many people had labeled me based on my frame. I needed it 
to end. I had had enough of standing by and listening as my 
classmates, uncle, parents, cousins cajoled at the fact that I 
was “chubby.” I didn’t want to look in the mirror any longer 
and think I would be nothing more than plus-sized.

In college, I stopped. It wasn’t out of realizing that I 

didn’t need to build an image of myself based on a perfect 
picture. It wasn’t even that I was forced to. After all these 
years, I looked the way I wanted to. I physically did not 

need to lose any more weight. In a way, I had done what I 
needed to do to get me to the place where I wanted to be. 
And now, I could move on with my life. I could run (it sure 
was easier!) to stay fit, and I could start fresh with trying 
to eat healthier. I finally had a fair chance at being in good 
shape.

It wasn’t quite the end of it, though.
It’s been four years since I stuck two fingers down my 

throat, but every once in a while, like the past usually does, 
it all creeps back up. As I sat on my best friend’s bed, wag-
ging my legs back and forth, waiting for my time in front 
of the mirror on the eve of this new year, she reminded me 
of how I had constantly denied that anything was wrong 
when she nagged me about my eating habits in high school. 
In our junior year, she had repeatedly asked if I regurgi-
tated meals, and I had blatantly (and, in my mind, convinc-
ingly) denied.

You really needed the wake-up call, to make you stop all 

that bullshit, she said as 2015 headed our way. But did I? It 
wasn’t like I stopped because I was told I should. I stopped 
because, in my mind, I had gotten what I wanted. I suc-
ceeded. There was nothing left to be gained.

Hello! I won.
The strategically choosing bathrooms, turning on fau-

cets, hiding behind music to carefully calculate how I was 
to expunge meals had worked. For half a decade, I played a 
game until it became my life, and then when the game had 
gotten spiritless, and rather futile, I stopped playing.

Yet, in letting my pride take over my memories, I forget.
I forget that there were more than a few dinner table 

meals with my family spent just waiting to dash out of 
my seat and into a secluded bathroom far away where no 
one would dare to look for me. In friends’ houses, I would 
always make it a point to leave soon after meals. I would 
cringe and then shake off the feeling of guilt before it set in 
too deep; I didn’t have a choice, after all. Restaurants, they 
were often the easier ones; I couldn’t really feel bad when I 
didn’t know the chef behind the plate.

Sure, it’s been four years since I stuck two fingers down 

my throat, but now I know that as much as I can hold 
my head up high, there is no way out. I am cursed into 
examining nutrition labels and counting calories. There 
will never be a day when the numbers on a weighing scale 

mean nothing.

Nowadays, I joke about it. I joke about how my half-

wits led me to believe that purging was the solution to my 
problems. I wave off any consequential flashes of sympa-
thy thereafter. Whenever someone slightly suggests that 
I might need help, I laugh, smile, and do everything but 
reveal the knots in my stomach. Every day, I try to make 
myself believe the person I am conquers my weight — only 
to realize that I’m stuck flipping that two-sided coin. My 
mood is so gravely determined by food. Whenever I feel 
disconsolate, all I want to do is eat. And 30 minutes and 
1,000 calories later, all I want to do is expunge the evidence 
that it ever happened in the first place.

Purging was never the disease. No, the disease is always 

believing that everyone else’s opinions are your truth.

I was a gifted student, a good daughter, and talented. 

Why didn’t this matter? Chances are that I will never have 
the answer. All I know is that it took me starvation and 
endured exercise to be able to believe that I had any merits 
at all.

It’s astonishing how much it hurts to hear the incre-

dulity in people’s voices when I tell them that used to be 
overweight. No way, they go. In a way, it undermines all the 
struggle that went into what made me into the more confi-
dent and less anxious person that I am today. After all these 
years, I still struggle to accept that my eating patterns 
(don’t dare call it a disorder!) did anything other than good.

It all feels like another lifetime ago. Writing this, I don’t 

feel like I’m writing about me but instead writing about a 
stranger I’ve been staring at from the outside. I can’t imag-
ine there ever being a time when I was that insecure and 
that reactive to people’s opinions. I promise you that things 
are different now than they were those four years ago. I 
am happy, ambitious and in love. I see a greater future for 
myself independent of how I look, but acquired on the basis 
of my accomplishments.

But I will always believe that I am here today because 

of the choice I made in my basement bathroom to change 
myself for good.

Let me tell you — in the moment, it was worth every last 

hurl.

I am a bulimic.

the Defense Manufacturing Assistance Program, 

which is run through the University’s Institute for 
Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy, in 

conjunction with Ohio State University and Purdue University.

The DMAP project is designed to help struggling small and medium-sized 

defense sector suppliers prevent layoffs, job losses and plant closures during 
periods of lower military spending, such as peacetime.

Should the country need to mobilize for war, capacity and capability to 

produce necessary equipment must be available, according to Larry Molnar, 
ILREE associate director. Because companies that have gone out of business 
can’t be mobilized in the event of an unexpected attack, keeping private sector 
defense suppliers viable is important to overall military preparedness.

“We don’t want to be in the situation where we have to respond (militarily) 

and we don’t have the infrastructure, and the capacity, and the capability to be 
able to provide critical technology,” Molnar said.

Military industry also provides jobs and other benefits to local commu-

nities. If the companies see less demand, those communities can face hard 
times. Preventing these hardships is another goal of the DMAP project, which 
attempts to work with the communities to provide support as well as stabilize 
firms to prevent the need for job loss.

While the DMAP project has a different mission from the Minerva-funded 

social science project, the undergraduate students who work on it similarly 
have the opportunity to develop a broad set of skills as well as make a differ-
ence.

According to Molnar, the students work to identify companies that might 

benefit from a partnership with the project. For these students, the work 
they’re doing has a tangible impact for the employees the project attempts to 
help, their families and the surrounding community, in addition to contribut-
ing to national security efforts.

“What they’re doing is not a theoretical or academic exercise,” Molnar said. 

“We’re working with real companies, with real people.”

At the University, another Defense Department project contributes funding 

to the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers project, 
which studies suicide prevention for men and women serving in the Armed 
Forces.

Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 3,000 

military service men and women have died through suicide, while more than 
6,800 died in combat during the same period. In 2012 and 2013, more service-
men and women died by suicide than by any other means, including combat.

“The Army STARRS project has been involved with the ways in which we 

can improve the health and well-being and resilience of the American soldier,” 
Jackson said.

The project, which is run in conjunction with the Uniformed Services Uni-

versity of the Health Sciences, Harvard Medical School, the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego and the National Institute of Mental Health, represents the 
largest effort to collect data on and study military personnel mental health 
risk.

The Army STARRS project is rooted in psychology, representing the diverse 

ways in which University research contributes to national security.

But this might come as little surprise. In 2013, the University had a $1.33 

billion research budget. However, situated in Ann Arbor, far from the bureau-
cratic politics of Washington, the University’s participation in national defense 
research may sometimes go unnoticed.

Such efforts allow undergraduate student researchers the opportunity to 

contribute to impactful research and develop important academic skills, by 
providing the opportunity to develop expertise that they may not otherwise 
have gotten through traditional education.

and thinking of ways to make the battalion better and 

even leave it better. Her thought process and the ideas she 
has are going to bring a lot to the table.”

Through her years in ROTC, Augustine said, she has sensed a change in her 

personality and anticipates her role with the military.

After graduating this May, Augustine will enter a nine-week training pro-

gram with other second lieutenant nurses, before being stationed at a hospital 
in active duty.

“I feel I’ve grown a lot through ROTC,” Augustine said. “I just feel like I’ve 

had a lot of personal development and the commitment seems super exciting. 
I love the opportunities that are available to me because of ROTC and serving 
the patient population is going to be great. I’m really looking forward to that.”

In the early hours of the morning last fall, I had the opportunity to photograph LSA 
sophomore Bryan Jones, a cadet in the University’s Army Reserve Officers Training 
Corps program, during his morning trainings. The ROTC cadets have physical training 
— known as PT — four days per week at 7 a.m., at which time they complete cardio 
and weight training in the CCRB and on Palmer Field. I also had the opportunity to 
photograph the cadets in other training exercises outside of standard PT, such as 
military field training in the Matthaei Botanical Gardens and 5 to 10 mile ruck marches 
throughout Ann Arbor. The dedication they demonstrated was incredible, and they 
worked exceedingly hard to meet the high demands of being both Army ROTC cadets 
and University students.
