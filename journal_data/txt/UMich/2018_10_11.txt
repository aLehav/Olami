University of Michigan 
students gathered to hear 
former Planned Parenthood 
President Cecile Richards 
speak Wednesday evening 
about her experience as an 
activist and organizer as 
well as her advice on how to 
mobilize Democratic voters.
The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 
College Democrats, along 
with Students for Whitmer, 
hosted 
Richards, 
who 
was in town to help with 
Gubernatorial 
candidate 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 
campaign. 
Public 
Policy 
senior Kellie Lounds, the 
chair of College Democrats, 
noted 
how 
inspiring 
Richards 
is 
for 
people 
wanting to make change.
“Our 
women’s 
issues 
committee, which is a part 
of College Dems, is one of 

our strongest groups, so I 
know there are people who 
were really excited about 
it,” Lounds said. “She is 
such 
an 
incredible 
and 
inspiring figure for young 
women across the country 
who want to get involved 
in organizing and want to 
make a difference in the 
political process without 
being an elected official is a 
really important speaker to 
have.”
Richards 
opened 
the 
talk by speaking about her 
familiarity with Michigan, 
recalling 
her 
time 
with 
Planned 
Parenthood 
providing 
health 
care 
services and family planning 
in the state. She knew 
Michigan and Ann Arbor, 
well enough to consider a 
trip to Zingerman’s a must, 
she joked.
She then turned to a more 
serious note, talking about 
how liberals may feel upset 

On Tuesday, the University 
of Michigan Office of the 
President released a letter 
addressing concerns of anti-
Semitism following reports 
of 
two 
U-M 
instructors 
refusing 
to 
write 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
for 
students wishing to study 
abroad 
in 
Israel 
and 
a 
controversial lecture given 
last week in the Penny 
Stamps Speaker Series.
The 
University’s 
letter, 
signed 
by 
University 
President Mark Schlissel and 
Provost Martin A. Philbert, 
affirms 
the 
University’s 
opposition to the boycott of 
Israeli academic institutions 
and assures the instructors’ 
actions are being addressed 
through current U-M policy.
“Withholding letters of 
recommendation based on 
personal views does not meet 
our university’s expectations 
for supporting the academic 
aspirations of our students,” 
the letter read. “Conduct that

Former head of Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual Programs calls for programming on history

LGBTQ 
rights 
speaker 
Ronni Sanlo spoke about the 
importance of acknowledging 
the historical roots of LGBTQ 
activism to a group of more 
than 50 students, faculty and 
alumni Wednesday night in 
honor of National Coming Out* 
Week. Sanlo also spoke about 

her personal coming out story 
in addition to her struggles as 
a lesbian in the 1980s when she 
faced rampant discrimination 
in the workplace and lost 
custody of her children.
Sanlo, who served as the 
director 
of 
the 
University 
of Michigan’s Lesbian and 
Gay Programs Office — and 
added the words “bisexual” 
and 
“transgender” 
to 
the 
office name — from 1994 to 

1997, 
highlighted 
current 
attitudes toward the LGBTQ 
community as products of a 
long fight against prejudice 
and discrimination. Sanlo said 
the lack of attention paid to 
LGBTQ history contributes 
to the community’s continued 
invisibility.
“You probably didn’t learn 
about us in school,” Sanlo said. 
“I sure didn’t. I didn’t learn 
about Alan Turing, a gay man 

who is considered the great 
parent of computer science and 
who broke the German code in 
1945 to help the allies win World 
War II. Or authors Gertrude 
Stein and her partner, Alice B. 
Toklas. People need to know 
that we LGBTQ folk didn’t 
just pop out of the Out Bar last

This is the first installment 
in a series of articles from The 
Michigan Daily that explore 
course evaluation and grade 
data at the University. Check 
out the article online to see The 
Daily’s interactive. 
When 
one 
LSA 
junior 
signed 
up 
for 
Psychology 
225: Psychology of Human 
Sexuality for semester, she did 
not realize she was about to 
take the course with the worst 
grade distribution in the entire 
college of LSA. 
The class has consistently 
produced a mean grade of C+ in 
the past two semesters in which 
the course was taught: the 
lowest average grade out of any 
class within LSA. The course 
has been taught over the last 9 
years by Associate Psychology 
professor 
Terri 
Conley. 
It 
offers a broad introduction 
of 
the 
various 
aspects 
of 
human sexuality as well as its 
intersections with gender.
“I was definitely surprised,” 
the junior, who wishes to remain 
anonymous due to worries of 
repercussions in class, said. 
“First of all, when I’m signing 
up for classes I don’t really look 
at the grade distributions — I 
know that’s a thing I can look 
at, but I never do. This was 
kind of something I signed up 
for last minute. I definitely 
wasn’t expecting it to be an 
easy course, but I also was not 

expecting it to be graded super 
harshly, especially since I’m 
a computer science major and 
this is a psych class, so I was 
definitely surprised.”
The course has been graded 
on a curve and often results in 
a normal distribution. Though 
the average was low, prior 
course 
evaluations 
showed 
students 
felt 
coursework 
was 
not 
overbearing 
and 
demonstrated strong interest in 
learning the subject matter.

Conley was very surprised 
to find out about the class’s 
standing; she did not know 
it had the lowest mean grade 
in LSA until The Michigan 
Daily informed her of the 
fact. Though she was aware 
her students did not always 
appreciate having a curve, she 
never imagined it would lead 
to the lowest average in LSA. 
She explained how students in 
her class from the Ross School 
of Business typically seemed 

to understand grading on the 
curve, but others struggled 
with it.
“The business school people 
who would take my class were 
always like, ‘Yeah, we know 
what is going on,’” Conley 
said. “So it was just shocking 
to me to have it as the lowest 
class because I assumed most 
people were doing this, but I 
guess this explains why people 
can’t understand the curve.

Spaces with media outlets that 
use sexual assault victim-blaming 
language or include features that 
defend rape perpetrators report 
more cases of rape and fewer 
related arrests, a University of 
Michigan study found. Political 
Science Assistant Professor Yuri 
Zhukov helped lead the first big 

data analysis of newspapers from 
2000 to 2013 regarding media’s 
portrayal of rape in the United 
States.
“We used the tone and content 
of local news reporting as a mea-
sure of local norms toward rape, 
and found that there are more 
reported instances of rape in U.S. 
counties where news coverage 
of sexual assault is particularly 
insensitive and dismissive,” Zhu-

kov wrote in an email interview. 
“In such areas, police are also less 
likely to make rape-related ar-
rests.”
Zhukov began the study when 
he was working on his Ph.D at 
Harvard University. Partnering 
with Harvard officials, he created 
a machine learning algorithm 
that read and categorized media 
reports of all kinds. During the 
media coverage analysis, however, 
the researchers came upon a 
report of an Ohio gang rape 
case and decided to apply 
their algorithm explicitly to 
rape coverage.
“We used natural lan-
guage processing and ma-
chine learning to detect 
victim-blaming language and 
other types of content in over 
300,000 newspaper articles,” 
Zhukov wrote. “We then used 
various 
statistical 
estima-
tors to establish a correlation 
between such language and 
local sexual crime rates, and 
to exclude various alternative 
explanations for this relation-
ship.”
Zhukov’s data correlates 
biased news coverage with an 
increase in rape reports and a 
decrease in police response. 
An obstacle in his research, 
however, is that most sexual 
assaults go unreported and 
an increase in rape statistics 
might also be connected with 
an increase of more victims 
coming forward or an in-
crease in crime. Even in the 

aftermath of #MeToo, Zhukov 
claims his study disproves these 
uncertainties.
“Unless more victims are com-
ing forward in the exact places 
where justice is most elusive, what 
we’re likely seeing is a genuine in-
crease in rape,” Zhukov wrote.
At the University, sexual mis-
conduct reports have risen steadi-
ly in the last four years, even as the 
national reporting rates hovers 
around 20 percent of survivors 
notifying authorities of sexual as-
sault. This year, the number of 
reports received by the Office of 
Institutional Equity jumped by 27 
percent. 
Zhukov said this research can-
not determine news coverage 
causes rape because that goes be-
yond the scope of the data.
“The more plausible explana-
tion –– consistent with previous 
research –– is that local news 
reporting reflects local norms 
toward sexual assault,” Zhukov 
wrote. “To victims, these norms 
might dictate how costly it is to 
come forward and seek justice. 
And where potential perpetrators 
believe that rape victims are un-
likely to come forward, they may 
feel more impunity.”
Zhukov claims not covering 
rape stories does more harm be-
cause an increase in news stories 
regarding rape are associated with 
greater levels of police vigilance 
and victims coming forward.

RIGHTS IN MYANM AR

MIKE ZLONKEVICZ/Daily
Wai Wai Nu, international award winning human rights activist, speaks about her advocacy work with Rohingya women at the CEW+ 
Christobel Kotelawela Weerasinghe Lecture in the Michigan Theater Wednesday evening. 

violates this expectation 
and harms students will 
not be tolerated and will 
be addressed with serious 
consequences. Such actions 
interfere with our students’ 
opportunities, violate their 
academic 
freedom 
and 
betray 
our 
university’s 
educational mission.”
The 
University 
is 
currently 
taking 
steps 
to 
discipline 
American 
Culture Associate professor 
John Cheney-Lippold, the 
first instructor to deny a 
letter of recommendation, 
a letter obtained by The 
Daily 
confirmed. 
The 
letter, written by Interim 
LSA Dean Elizabeth Cole 
and addressed to Cheney-
Lippold, 
states 
he 
will 
not be eligible for a salary 
increase 
in 
the 
2018-
2019 school year and his 
sabbatical credits will be 
frozen for two years.
The 
Office 
of 
the 
President 
letter 
also 
announced the University 
has created a panel of 
faculty to “examine the 
intersection 
between 
political 
thought/
ideology 
and 
faculty 
members’ 
responsibilities 
to students.” The panel 
will 
be 
chaired 
by 
President Emeritus James 
Duderstadt, a professor of 
science and engineering.
The 
letter 
outlined 
the goals of the panel, 

which include reviewing 
current university policy, 
examining similar policies 
of peer institutions and 
gathering 
stakeholder 
input. 
Ultimately, 
the 
panel is supposed to give 
recommendations on how 
to clarify existing policy 
or create new policy that 
better 
addresses 
how 
faculty should balance their 
personal views with their 
responsibilities to students.
The letter also addressed 
a Penny Stamps Speaker 
Series presentation given 
by 
Emory 
Douglas, 
an 
artist for the Black Panther 
Party in 1967 through the 
1980s. On one slide of his 
presentation, he displayed 
images of Adolf Hitler and 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu saying 
they both had committed 
genocide.
The 
University 
stated 
Israel 
was 
not 
singled 
out, as the presentation 
included imagery critical 
of other political leaders, 
and the ideas of speakers 
are not always reflective 
of those of the University. 
However, it extended an 
apology to those offended.
“Hitler and the genocide 
that 
he 
led, 
however, 
represent a horrific level of 
evil with few if any parallels 
in human history,” the letter 
read. “We understand how 
these images are offensive, 
particularly in this case to 
Jewish students. We are 
sorry students were hurt by 
this experience.”

PANEL
From Page 1A

Although I do think it is a little 
troubling when people with 
psychology backgrounds don’t 
understand what a normal 
distribution looks like.”
The Daily’s data estimates 
PSYCH 225 is the only course 
in LSA that uses a true normal 
distribution centered at B-/
C+. The vast majority of 
curved courses use a skewed 
distribution, which results in 
significantly higher average 
grades.
Conley also argued the 
curve used to benefit students’ 
overall grade, contrary to what 
many of her students believed. 
“The curve actually always 
helped out students, it didn’t 
hurt students,” Conley said. “I 
would say that but I think they 
didn’t believe me except for the 
ones maybe who would come 
in and look at the distribution 
with me.”
Course 
evaluation 
data 
obtained by The Daily through 
the Freedom of Information 
Act also shows many students 
in the course felt like they did 
not know what was expected 
of 
them. 
Previous 
course 
evaluations show 69 percent 
of people felt they knew 
what was expected of them 
in the course. 88 percent of 
University courses had better 
expectation scores.
The 
LSA 
junior 
also 
mentioned 
the 
issue 
of 
expectations. She explained 
even though the syllabus is 
pretty cohesive, the exam 
style and the grading scale are 
not articulated thoroughly by 
instructors.
“The 
syllabus 
is 
very 
detailed, and we also have 
to sign a student contract,” 
she said. “So I think there is 
a big emphasis on the setting 
expectations, but I also think 
it’s kind of hard to really 
know what exams are going 
to be like before you go in. 

We 
did 
have 
the 
practice midterm, but even 
still, the criteria of the grading 
scale was not sent out until 
the morning of the exam. So 
yes, that sets expectations, 
but it gives no room to prepare 
accordingly.”
In regard to the course’s 
level 
of 
difficulty, 
Conley 
explained she never wanted to 
make the class unnecessarily 
hard, but instead hoped to 
offer a meaningful 
 challenge 
for her students.
“I 
get 
concerned 
about 
setting the bar too low, to some 
extent you could say if you 
reward people they persist,” 
Conley said. “But if it’s so easy 
that it doesn’t seem meaningful 
then I think people are less 
inclined to value what they’ve 
learned or think it’s important. 
I tend to think we should be 
having students work hard 
because that’s why you come 
to college, it’s supposed to be a 
challenge.”
Conley also addressed the 
challenge of getting some 
students to appreciate the 
academic nature of a class on 
sexuality, which is something 
she feels is not a problem in 
other subjects.
“It’s not like I set out 
to do this, this wasn’t my 
goal, but as I think of it, it 
does serve a purpose with 
this particular topic — an 
argument you wouldn’t have 
to make in students, let’s say, 
in chemistry, that chemistry is 
difficult or that chemistry can 
be intellectually challenging,” 
Conley said.
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Samantha Kennedy is also 
taking the class this semester. 
She felt the low grade average 
might be due to something as 
simple as differing levels of 
incoming 
knowledge 
about 
human sexuality.
“I think that the most 
surprising to me about it 
was just that I assumed a 
lot of people had the same 
knowledge I had going in and 
that’s why it might’ve been 

easy for everyone, but I’m 
realizing people, especially 
freshman or sophomores who 
haven’t taken other women 
studies classes before, might 
not have had exposure to this 
kind of thinking, and this kind 
of open discussion about sex.”
Kennedy 
also 
praised 
the content of the course, 
especially the way that it 
exposes students to facets of 
sexuality which are not usually 
accessible 
in 
a 
classroom 
setting.
“We’ve 
broached 
a 
lot 
of 
topics 
that 
are 
often 
considered 
taboo 
to 
talk 
about in a classroom setting,” 
Kennedy said. “For example, 
we watched porn in class the 
other day, and we had a guest 
lecturer come in and pass 
around sex toys, so it’s been 
fun.”
This 
semester, 
Conley 
redesigned the exam style 
from mostly multiple choice 
to short answer. She hopes 
the change will offer students 
a chance to critically think 
about the concepts in class.
“This semester, I decided 
I wanted to try to engage 
them in a different way that I 
thought might map on better to 
how the course is structured, 
which is asking you to think 
critically about the issues 
that we’re talking about and 
provide their own ideas,” she 
said. “So that’s how the class 
is structured this semester to 
see if we can challenge them 
in a way that’s different than 
what we do in multiple choice 
exams.”
Students 
recently 
experienced one of the new 
exams through a practice 
midterm, which took place last 
week.
While 
the 
LSA 
junior 
appreciated the chance to 
try out the exam without the 
pressure of a grade, she found 
it very difficult to complete in 
the amount of time provided. 
She said the exam consisted 
of 8 essay-style questions and 
about 12 minutes were allotted 

to answer each one.
“We did just have a practice 
midterm, so it was the same 
format as the other exams, but it 
doesn’t actually count towards 
our grades,” she said. “Which 
was a nice opportunity, but it 
ended up being super hard … 
Even though it was open note, 
we had to cite from lectures 
and the book, so that was 
definitely kind of surprising 
for me because that was more 
difficult than I expected.”
Kennedy, however, found 
the exam less difficult and 
noted 
the 
importance 
of 
using critical thinking when 
answering questions.
“To me, it seemed relatively 
easy,” Kennedy said. “A lot of 
it was asking questions that 
sort of encouraged us to do 
our own analysis of things 
we had talked about a lot like 
stigmas 
surrounding 
STD, 
uses and comfort with sex 
toys and things like that. I felt 
that I was able to answer the 
questions pretty well by being 
able to think critically about 
topics we had discussed and 
less because of studying.”
Moving 
forward, 
Conley 
offered suggestions on how 
to succeed in her course. She 
emphasized talking through 
the 
different 
concepts 
in 
class 
and 
really 
thinking 
critically about the course. 
She also encouraged students 
to continue taking her class, 
even if it is more challenging, 
because it has a lot to offer.
“So many people when they 
take the course they really 
appreciate it but they say, ‘I 
gave you low scores because 
it was hard,’… and I feel like 
people should be tougher than 
that,” Conley said. “You got 
into Michigan, you’re smart 
and you’re accomplished and 
you should be able to be up for 
a challenge and not downgrade 
a course because it’s hard – 
that seems not completely fair. 
So I’d like people to appreciate 
that the course has things to 
offer them even if it’s not going 
to be an easy A.”

or despondent about Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
to the Supreme Court this 
past 
weekend. 
Richards 
emphasized, 
though, 
the 
importance of perseverance. 
This time in history is one 
of the most exciting for 
activists, she said.
“For folks who want to be 
involved in social change 
and changing the world, for 
good or bad, there’s never 
been a better time to do that,” 
Richards said. 
To 
enact 
this 
change, 
Richards urged students to 
get out into the community 
and register people to vote. In 
response to a question about 
how to talk to people with 
opposite 
beliefs, 
Richards 
said while engaging with the 
other side is important, the 
focus should be on increasing 
the voter base.
“Right now, if the people 
in this room just focused on 
students and other folks who 

are registered to vote but who 
do not vote in midterms, your 
job is done,” Richards said.
Though Richards said her 
primary focus as president 
of Planned Parenthood was 
on affordable health care 
and reproductive rights, she 
noted these issues intersect 
with a broad spectrum of 
others. The people she helped 
during her time at Planned 
Parenthood, Richards said, 
are also struggling to find 
access to basic human needs 
such as clean water or a safe 
community.
“Same folks who are having 
trouble accessing affordable 
health care, are having trouble 
accessing clean water, right 
here in Michigan, or trouble 
accessing a community or a 
school that feels safe for their 
children,” Richards said. “All 
of these things are completely 
connected. So we have to be 
thinking about how do we 
change inequality on all of 
these issues.”
Richards 
started 
her 
career as a labor organizer, 
working across several states 

to 
help 
service 
workers 
with minimum wage and 
no benefits organize unions 
campaigns. 
Many 
of 
the 
people she worked with, she 
said, were not originally a 
part of the labor movement 
and are now doing more 
work than ever before, even 
with stricter laws against 
organizing. 
Richards 
emphasized 
repeatedly 
throughout her talk how this 
type of grassroots work is the 
way to make an impact in the 
government.
“We need to imagine the 
country we want, and then 
work to build it,” Richards 
said. “Because it’s not going 
to come from Washington 
down, it’s going to come from 
the grassroots up.”
LSA junior Emily Nistad, 
a 
member 
of 
College 
Democrats, said what stayed 
with 
her 
after 
Richards’ 
talk was how even by just 
encouraging 
her 
friends 
to vote, she could make a 
change.
“What 
really 
resonates 
with me right now is talking 

to your friends and getting 
them to vote and how to get 
people who are your peers 
interested and excited about 
the elections that are coming 
up,” Nistad said. “I feel like a 
lot of college students have a 
harder time thinking about 
that, but really the focus 
should be on just talking to 
your friends about it and the 
small things you can do.”
In the last election, campus 
voter turned out ranged from 
42.8 percent to 49.71 percent. 
So, according to Richards, 
voting is key. She said while 
acts of protest are important, 
Democrats need to work to 
make a lasting change. 
“Knitting your pussy hat, 
fantastic,” 
Richards 
said. 
“Showing up with hilarious 
signs, drinking wine with 
your 
friends 
and 
writing 
irate 
postcards 
to 
Mitch 
McConnell is good therapy. 
But 
voting 
and 
actually 
building political power that 
lasts is … so that’s kind of 
what I’m interested in. How 
do we take this moment, and 
make it a movement?”

National 
Coming 
Out* 
Week, 
hosted 
by 
the 
University’s 
Spectrum 
Center, runs from Oct. 8 
to 12 and features a queer 
student panel and student 
mixer, among other events. 
The week is centered around 
National Coming Out Day 
on Oct. 11, which began in 
1988 to commemorate the 
1987 
National 
March 
on 
Washington for Lesbian and 
Gay Rights.
Mark 
Chung 
Kwan 
Fan, the assistant director 
for 
engagement 
of 
the 
Spectrum Center, said the 
week’s events focused on 
the intersectionality of the 
LGBTQ 
community. 
Fan 
hoped National Coming Out* 
Week would increase visibility 
for less-known populations, 
such as transgender people of 
color.
“I think that with the 
campus climate or societal 
climate changing, there are 
visibilities for some but not 
for others,” Fan said. “When 
we think about cis white gay 
men, for example, there’s a lot 
of visibility. When we refer to 
the LGBT community, a lot of 
people say ‘gay,’ and that’s just 
one subpopulation.”
Sanlo, who identifies as 
Jewish, also discussed the 

importance of recognizing 
the diversity of the LGBTQ 
community. Citing a piece by 
writer Rita Mae Brown, Sanlo 
said the LGBTQ community 
is “confusing” because its 
members come from every 
possible 
race, 
ethnicity, 
religion and socio-economic 
background.
“There are Jewish LGBT 
people and zen ones, Muslim 
and all the other religious 
possibilities, and some who 
don’t believe in any religion 
at all,” Sanlo said. “What we 
do have in common with one 
another in all our varieties 
is that many people who are 
not lesbian, gay, bisexual or 
transgender think us odd.”
Music, Theatre & Dance 
freshman Syd Brown said 
Sanlo’s lecture made them 
realize how important history 
is to understanding current 
LGBT issues. Brown also 
discussed how using theater 
as a form of activism has 
allowed them to spread their 
message of acceptance and 
understanding 
in 
a 
more 
effective way.
“I’m really interested in the 
creative arts as a whole as a 
medium for exploring social 
justice,” Brown said. “(History) 
is not something that’s taught 
a whole lot, and it’s only talked 
about in our circles. I think 
branching out and reaching 
people who aren’t necessarily 
part of the community and 
bringing our history to them is 
really important.”

explained two-factor as a 
combination of what you 
know and what you have.
“When I think of two-
factor, I really think of it as a 
combination of what you know, 
meaning your password, and 
what you have, meaning your 
second factor,” Pendse said. 
“And what you have could be 
your smartphone, or it could 
be a variety of other things.”
Pendse described a number 
of options people can choose 
from for their second factor. 
The most common is to 
receive a push notification on 
your smartphone, but a text 
message, a hardware token 
or a special string of code are 
also available.
Pendse said he believed that 
in the current climate, it is 
necessary to make sure we are 
protecting our accounts from 
phishing attacks and other 
forms of hacking.
“Frankly, 
in 
the 
world 

we live in right now, we are 
constantly 
dealing 
with 
security challenges,” Pendse 
said. “I’m sure not a day goes 
by when you don’t pick up a 
newspaper with an article 
where somebody is hacked.”
DePriest Dockins, assistant 
director of identity and access 
management at ITS, also 
voiced his excitement about 
the potential of two-factor 
authentication on campus.
“We 
are 
really 
excited 
about expanding two-factor 
across the Ann Arbor and 
the 
Dearborn 
campuses,” 
DePriest said. “I think that 
this will go a long way in 
making us more secure.”
Florian Schaub, assistant 
professor at the School of 
Information and College of 
Engineering, said he enabled 
two-factor authentication as 
soon as it became available 
and believes in the push to 
make it mandatory among 
faculty.

he fraternity is an institution 
almost 
as 
long-standing 
as American universities 
themselves. The very first can be 
traced back to 1776 when the Phi 
Beta Kappa society was founded at 
the College of William & Mary in 
Williamsburg, Va. Since then, Greek 
life has grown astronomically, with 
over 9 million members nationally. 
Many politically and financially 
successful individuals often publicly 
reminisce 
about 
their 
college 
days spent in Greek life, and those 
currently involved in such institutions 
will defend their chapters with fierce 
loyalty.
To their credit, sororities and 
fraternities have been known to 
provide a strong sense of community 
to emerging college students and to 
devote themselves to philanthropic 
endeavors. However, in recent years, 
it has become glaringly apparent that 
Greek life is getting out of hand with 
potentially dire consequences. With 
reports of deadly hazing, dangerous 
levels 
of 
alcohol 
consumption, 
increased instances of sexual assault 
and stories of racist incidents within 
chapters, Greek life is under intense 
scrutiny.
Major universities across the 
nation have taken steps to control 
this image, either by suspending, 
banning or regulating the activities of 
fraternities and sororities. However, 
as universities work to mitigate the 
criticisms of Greek life, it is reasonable 
to question the purpose of the 
Greek system as a whole. As colleges 
continue to increase non-Greek life 
related student organizations, as 
the internet develops new outlets 
to connect current students with 
alumni and as horrific stories of 
Greek life reality come to light, it is 
clear that the original purpose of such 
organizations is now obsolete.
There are abundant examples of 
Greek life gone wrong that illuminate 
how the disadvantages associated 
with such organizations far outweigh 
any potential benefits. Fraternities 
certainly bear the brunt of this image. 
While pop culture representation 
perpetuates an Animal House-type 
lifestyle of partying and drinking with 
reckless abandon, the true reality is 
much darker.
Take, for example, the February 
2017 death of 19-year-old Timothy 
Piazza. Piazza, a pledge at the Beta 
Theta Pi fraternity at Pennsylvania 
State University, fell down a flight 
of stairs after an evening of heavy 
drinking during a hazing event. He 
was carried, unconscious, to a couch 
by his fraternity brothers after the fall, 
clearly in need of medical attention. 
Instead, the other members slapped, 
punched and poured beer on him. He 
laid unconscious for 12 hours before 
emergency medical care was called, 
and Piazza died soon thereafter.

In response to Piazza’s death, 
his parents pressed charges against 
several members of the Penn State 
chapter of Beta Theta Pi, and the 
president of the university vowed to 
increase punishment for instances 
of hazing. Yet, it is not difficult to 
find instances of hazing with dire 
consequences. Matthew Carrington 
died of hypothermia and water 
intoxication in the basement of the 
Chi Tau fraternity house when he 
was doused with cold water while 
forced to drink five gallons of water 
as part of a hazing ritual at California 
State University in 2005. Four student 
pledges in total died as a result of 
hazing in 2017 alone.
Yet, on the campuses of fraternities 
where such tragedies have occurred, 
these names are barely remembered. 
When a young pledge dies at the 
hands of fraternity members, there 
is typically a period of fierce outrage, 
condemnation of the programs, 
suspension of the fraternity chapter, 
and then everyone involved begins to 
resume their typical lives — not even 
noticing that the same practices occur 
frequently after the fact.
Beyond 
the 
deaths 
resulting 
from hazing or excessive alcohol 
consumption, 
fraternities 
have 
frequently found themselves involved 
in scandals of another nature. 
Research shows that fraternity men 
are three times more likely to commit 
sexual assault than their non-Greek 
life 
affiliated 
peers. 
Conversely, 
membership in a sorority is considered 
a risk factor for sexual assault, with 
some reports demonstrating up to 
74 percent of college sexual assault 
victims are sorority members.
There have been several public 
instances of fraternities and their 
issues with sexual assault. In 2010, 
fraternity men at prestigious Yale 
University were recorded chanting 
the pro-rape phrase “No means yes, 
yes means anal” around campus. 
Matthew 
Peterson, 
a 
fraternity 
brother at Georgia Institute of 
Technology, circulated an email 
around his fraternity containing a 
manual titled “Luring your rapebait.” 
At many universities, young women 
are instructed on which fraternities 
are safe and which to avoid because of 
their reputations of sexual assault.
Sexual assault is just one of the 
many issues plaguing fraternities 
today. As most fraternities nationwide 
are almost entirely comprised of 
white members, fraternity culture 
has become deeply intertwined 
with racism. The University of 
Michigan made headlines in 2013 
when the Theta Xi fraternity 
planned a social event titled “Hood 
Ratchet Thursday,” capitalizing on 
racial stereotypes of Black people 
and appropriating them to a largely 
white audience. In 2015, University 
of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon 

brothers were recorded singing 
a fraternity song including the 
following lyric: “There will never be 
a (expletive) in SAE.” This chant was 
allegedly taught across chapters of the 
fraternity. In April 2018, California 
Polytechnic University suspended all 
Greek life after photos circulated of 
white fraternity members appearing 
in blackface.
While 
the 
negative 
aspects 
of fraternity life have long been 
exposed, the practices of sororities 
are often equally problematic. Three 
George 
Washington 
University 
students were expelled from Alpha 
Phi after they posted a picture with 
a racist caption comparing African 
Americans to monkeys. Harley 
Barber, a former member of Alpha 
Phi was expelled from the University 
of Alabama in 2018 after posting two 
racist rant videos to her secondary 
Instagram account.
Compounding the racial issues, 
sororities have long had issues 
pertaining to image and what the 
ideal sorority girl should “look” 
like. This problem was once again 
highlighted this past September by 
the so-called “Beta Delta Letter,” 
published by an anonymous former 
sorority recruitment chair for the 
University of Michigan chapter. 
In this letter, the author details 
the methods by which the PNMs, 
or potential new members, of the 
sorority were rated on a scale from 
one to 10, largely based on whether or 
not their physical appearance fit the 
conventional beauty standards of a 
“top tier” sorority. Once deeper in the 
recruitment process, the recruitment 
chairs resorted to ranking their 
fellow sorority sisters on the same 
scale, determining who would be 
best apt to recruit the most desirable 
pledges. Once said pledges were 
officially recruited, a PowerPoint 
presentation was sent to fraternities 
with their names and faces only, with 
no other personal information.
If I were to include all or even most 
of the publicly known controversies 
associated with Greek life, this article 
would be nearly endless. The truth is, 
these are issues that arise constantly, 
and very few of us are surprised 
when we hear them. A tragedy or 
instance of egregious sexism or 
racism is uncovered, individuals 
are reprimanded or chapters are 
suspended, and similar circumstances 
occur again elsewhere. The steps 
taken in the past to remedy these 
affairs are not working. As important 
as Greek life is to social life on college 
campuses and to individuals involved, 
it is clear that it is now antiquated, 
resulting in senseless tragedies from 
which universities must disaffiliate.

Water we doing?
T

he water filter in the 
Chemistry 
Building 
was 
still broken today, leaving its 
attached drinking fountain completely 
unusable. I think to myself, “For a city 
that has a knack for self-sustenance, 
isn’t that kind of disappointing?” 
Resources 
both 
tangible 
and 
intangible are plentiful here in Ann 
Arbor, so it’s always striking when I 
see it slacking. 
In 2014, the EPA required cities to 
test their water systems for a series of 
chemicals. Ann Arbor complied and 
found the high rates of PFAS. PFAS 
are essentially man-made chemicals 
that are difficult to break down in 
any setting. As expected, exposure to 
these chemicals has adverse health 
effects, such as damage to the immune 
system, cancer, birth defects and 
thyroid hormone disruption. Our 
health can be jeopardized by these 
chemicals and there’s no doubt that 
the quality of our grass, ponds, trees, 
hills and air is at stake as well.
It’s not in our control — nor should 
it necessarily be our responsibility — 
to maintain the prevalence of these 
chemicals in the environment around 
us. This type of professionalism and 
protection should come from the 
industries that use and contain these 
chemicals: 
manufacturing 
plants 
and landfills. The city of Ann Arbor 
discovered the chemicals due to runoff 
from these types of urban settings, 
and the reason we didn’t know they 
were there in the first place is because 
our local manufacturing plants and 
landfill maintenance teams do not 
prioritize informing the city about 
the risks that can result from the work 
they do, or even worse, they are not 
even aware of how their work can 
produce these threatening chemicals.
I understand that the information 

we 
collectively 
have 
regarding 
the hazards of PFAS is somewhat 
minimal because it’s a relatively new 
chemical that’s in the beginning stages 
of study. However, I don’t understand 
how industry has proceeded to use 
or produce it without considering 
its potential harmful consequences. 
We should have industrial centers 
that put quality of life at the forefront 
of their work. It’s not enough to find 
solutions to the issues we create for 
ourselves; those who have the ability 
to make decisions for household 
items production and for maintaining 
our infrastructure need to think 
about preventing an issue before it 
even happens. This is a worldwide 
phenomenon, 
one 
almost 
an 
impossible one to change at this point, 
I know that. Despite this, we deserve 
a healthy life for ourselves and the 
organisms in our ecosystems, and I am 
more than willing to come together in 
this step toward bringing attention to 
our society’s workings that threaten 
well-being.
 Ann Arbor officials have asked 
for $850,000 from the City Council 
to upgrade the filtration system of 
its water treatment plant to reduce 
the risk of contamination in its 
filtered drinking water. Using new 
technology to execute this goal, the 
water treatment plant staff will fully 
fund this attempt to restore the quality 
of the river, as it should. Currently, 
the city has resumed testing and 
has measured its drinking water at 
conditions that already exceed the 
standards of the EPA, Michigan 
Department 
of 
Environmental 
Quality,and several other centers for 
disease control.
However, 
water 
treatment 
manager Brian Steglitz predicts even 
better conditions after new filters 

are added, stating, “PFOS/PFOA 
levels in the drinking water will be 
reliably below 10-ppt.” He and the 
water treatment plant staff are urged 
the decision to be made this month 
about the amount of money that the 
city will allow for this restoration. It’s 
imperative that we use the resources 
we have to allow ourselves to perform 
the best we can. There are cities 
that are unable to concentrate their 
efforts into a particular sector that is 
struggling to maintain a consistent 
output, especially if its people have 
little to no actual care for it, because 
they are preoccupied with the issues 
of other more prominent sectors.
But I know that the city I just 
described is not Ann Arbor. I am 
proud to live in a city and attend a 
university that cares now more than 
ever before about the impact of its 
actions on the quality of our local 
environment. I valued being raised in 
a community that values quality and 
is mindful of making itself available 
and adaptable so that everything and 
everyone can coexist. People in this 
city don’t deserve to be scolded for its 
shortcomings that occur when other 
corporations or government bodies 
function with ignorance, so I am 
teeming with urgency for this city. I 
want it to do better in the ways that 
it can. I want people to take it upon 
themselves to fix the disparity we 
have in front us between abundant 
capability and subpar output. Be 
determined to fix what’s irreparable. 
Demand more from each other. Give 
us the clean water that should be easily 
accessible and treatable here out of all 
places. Invest in the water filter.

The plight of Greek life

The on-demand gig work of survival

mid all the news that 
dominated the media 
last week, Amazon also 
made the headlines. 
After 
months 
of 
pressure, it raised the 
minimum wage of its 
U.S. employees to $15 
an hour.
You would think 
this marked at least 
one 
happy 
ending 
following 
the 
amalgam of events 
occurring last week. 
Instead, 
Amazon’s 
decision only reveals the bubble 
of indifference in which big 
tech companies are wrapping 
themselves. 
While 
Amazon 
raised their hourly pay by $1, it 
also decided to cut their yearly 
bonuses, making its workers 
lose at least $1,400 dollars a 
year, as estimated by one of 
its workers. Still, this is only 
part of Amazon’s story, a story 
that conceals the struggles of a 
subset of its workers.
Part of my research at one 
of the labs in the Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer 
Science 
Department 
is 
collecting data on how people 
perceive similarities between 
words. I was told to set up a 
task on Amazon’s Mechanical 
Turk, an online platform that 
researchers use to collect data 
from people which are later used 
in creating artificial intelligence 
models. Or, the way Amazon 
likes to put it, a “marketplace” 
that allows the use of “human 
intelligence” in solving tasks 
that computers are currently 
unable to do. This was my first 
time using anything remotely 
similar to MTurk. The process, 
though, 
was 
misleadingly 
easy. Selecting the number of 
cents to pay each respondent, 
getting 500 responses in less 
than 8 hours and immediately 
rejecting 200 respondents for 
unsatisfactory 
answers 
was 
strangely straightforward for 
something that affected 500 
people. After all, those cents 
were someone’s food for the 
day. After all, I had rejected 
200 people, who would never 
receive those cents.
While I was looking through 
the comments section filled 
by MTurkers (that’s how we 
call Amazon MTurk workers) 
I noticed how many of the 
comments 
were 
a 
simple 
“Thanks!” or “I really enjoyed 
taking this survey.” I started 
wondering about the people 

filling in the answers to my 
word similarity task. My eyes 
glided toward the answers they 
had 
provided 
on 
their demographics. 
The 
majority 
was 
middle 
class, 
educated 
people, 
known to use MTurk 
to 
supplement 
their earnings, but 
there was another 
predominant group. 
One 
filled 
with 
people who were part 
of the lower middle 
class or even living in poverty.
Still, I couldn’t stop there. 
Those few comments filled 
with human gratitude had built 
a small bridge between those 
MTurkers and me. “My job just 
fell through …” was among the 
first titles I saw on Reddit’s 
forum dedicated to discussions 
between MTurkers. It was 
written by a person who had 
just moved to a new city, had 
lost their job, had no degree 
and was suffering from anxiety, 
asking if working on MTurk 
could provide enough money 
to survive for the next three to 
four weeks. The first answer the 
person received said a couple 
of years ago MTurk provided 
users with enough money for 
minimum survival but that was 
no longer a possibility. The rest 
of the posts were of a similar 
nature: people desperate to 
earn enough money for survival 
through MTurk and responses 
from those saying that Amazon 
was no longer providing that 
possibility.
A 2016 Pew Research found 
5 percent of workers earning 
money from MTurk used the 
platform because there was no 
other available work in their 
area. Imagine having a full-time 
job where your performance is 
constantly monitored. Where 
there is a clock timing the 
amount of time you spend on 
each task that you have, a clock 
that stops whenever you go to 
the bathroom, take lunch or 
start daydreaming in front of 
your computer. At the end of the 
day, your pay is based not on the 
8 hours spent at the office, but 
rather the number of minutes 
completely focused on your 
work. Imagine on top of that, 
for every mistake you make on 
your tasks your manager takes 
away a certain percentage of 
your money. Imagining this 
doesn’t even fully encapsulate 
the life of an MTurker trying to 

survive the gig economy.
The reason why my survey 
was completed by the time I 
woke up on that next day? It’s 
because people who use MTurk 
to support themselves often 
wake up at 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. to 
fight for the highest-paying 
tasks. The reason why people 
are 
finding 
it 
increasingly 
hard to earn money through 
MTurk? 
It’s 
because 
the 
numbers 
of 
MTurkers 
is 
growing. It’s because, based 
on a Pew Research estimation 
by 2027 nearly one in three 
Americans 
might 
transition 
to online platforms to support 
themselves with on demand gig 
work.
MTurk is the perfect model 
for 
keeping 
the 
world 
of 
researchers 
separated 
from 
that of the workers. Broadly 
put, it is the perfect model for 
separating the educated and 
the uneducated, through the 
power of technology.
The bubble of indifference 
in which tech companies are 
wrapping themselves? It’s a 
bubble that helps them set 
their eyes on the future, to 
the detriment of the present. 
People 
working 
in 
the 
technology world are investing 
money into creating benevolent 
Artificial Intelligence, fearing 
that future AI might get out of 
hand. People working in the 
technology world are paying 
their employees so little that 
they are forcing them to rely 
on food stamps. They are 
scared about the possibility of a 
future where AI will take over 
our jobs, while forgetting that 
the way we are building these 
AI technologies is by taking 
advantage of people desperate 
to make a few cents.
As 
a 
student, 
I 
try 
to 
understand 
this 
world 
of 
competing 
needs. 
Where 
the 
clear 
negative 
impact 
big 
technology 
companies 
can have, and my carefully 
tailored résumé to these same 
companies have to coexist. In a 
similar manner, tech companies 
have to start caring about both 
building the future generation 
of benevolent AI technologies 
and their employees and gig-
workers. The answer to these 
two 
conundrums? 
That 
is 
something that neither Amazon 
or I have figured out yet.

Siimar shows maturity in 4-2 run 
at ITA All-American Tournament 

No longer in his first year, 
Mattias 
Siimar 
proved 
his 
growth and experience this 
past week at the ITA All-
American singles tournament 
in Tulsa, Okla.
Playing against the nation’s 
cream 
of 
the 
crop, 
the 
sophomore finished 4-2 on the 
week, playing six matches in as 
many days. 
“For (Siimar), the more tennis 
the 
better,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg. “He just 
loves playing, so he got to play 
a ton. So I’m sure he’s thrilled 
about the whole experience.”
The first two days of the 
tournament, Siimar was forced 
to play three matches to qualify 
for 
the 
main 
draw. 
After 
comfortably winning the first 
Monday, he looked as if he was 
struggling early in his second 
match, suffering a 6-0 loss in 
the first set before turning on 
the afterburners and winning 
the next two, 6-1, 7-5. 
“(Siimar), like I said, loves 

tennis,” Steinberg said. “He 
loves to compete. He’ll never 
give up. He believes in himself. 
So when he loses a set 6-0, he 
will not fade away for sure. He’s 
going to come back. He’s always 
been like that; he’ll always be 
like that. So I wasn’t surprised 
that he figured out and let that 
set go in his mind.”
Though 
exhausted, 
he 
followed that win with another 
on the same day to get out of the 
qualifying rounds, this time in 
straight sets.
“(Siimar’s) 
goal 
was 
to 
qualify and get into the main 
draw,” said Steinberg. “I don’t 
think he cared if he played 
at three in the morning, two 
matches. He wanted to make 
it so bad, so he was motivated. 
And he’s in good shape. He can 
play those matches.”
His toughest test came in 
the first round of the main 
draw on Thursday, when he 
played 
nationally-ranked 
No. 16 Aleksandre Bakshi of 
Oklahoma. Siimar dominated 
the first set, 6-1, before losing 
the next two sets, 6-3 each. 

“He won the first set easy and 
was up early in the second set 
then lost his focus a little bit,” 
Steinberg said. “When you do 
that against those top players, 
then all of a sudden you’re in a 
bad hole that you didn’t think 
you’d be in.”
“In the big picture of things, I 
think it’ll help (him) as he goes 
along because he’ll be prepared 
to play with the number one 
and two at the University of 
Oklahoma right there,” added 
Steinberg. “Even though he 
lost, it’ll help his confidence.”
Siimar finished the weekend 
in the back draw, winning 
his first match before losing 
Saturday in the consolation 
round of 16, marking a winning 
record for the underclassman 
who is bound to be one of the 
top players in the lineup when 
team competition rolls around 
in the winter.
“He 
lives 
and 
breathes 
(tennis),” Steinberg said. “He 
wants to get better and when 
you have guys like that, it’s 
always positive and they always 
improve.”

Pastujov finds footing early for Wolverines

Six minutes into the No. 
4 Michigan hockey team’s 
exhibition 
match 
against 
Waterloo, Nick Pastujov found 
daylight.
In the middle of a five-on-
three advantage, the junior 
forward positioned himself 
in the slot, corralled a pass 
from junior wing Jake Slaker 
and slapped in his second goal 
in as many games into the 
bottom right corner of the net.
“It’s huge because it gets 
the monkey off your back,” 
Pastujov said. “When you 
finish the year so strong and 
you work so hard during 
the summer and the spring, 
getting that first goal in the 
first real game feels amazing. 
It could have easily just not 
gone in, but it’s nice to get 
that confidence rolling in the 
game.”
For Pastujov, a fast start 
like this is a new and welcome 
sight. Points were few and 
far between for him as a 
freshman, tallying one goal 
and two assists. To start his 
sophomore season, Pastujov 
had to deal with nagging 
injuries, 
cutting 
into 
his 
playing time and development. 
But just as the Wolverines 
caught fire in the second 
half of last season, Pastujov 
found a spark. 
In the NCAA 
Tournament, 
he scored a goal 
in a 6-3 win 
over 
Boston 
University 
and 
notched 
an 
assist 
in 
Michigan’s 
semifinal 
loss 
to Notre Dame, 
cementing 
himself in the Wolverines’ 
depth 
chart 
as 
one 
of 
Michigan’s key wings.
With 15 points under his 
belt, Pastujov found much of 
his success that year in good, 
old-fashioned 
five-on-five 
hockey.
“I think it was definitely 

after Christmas when the 
team and I got into that same 
grove and started winning 
a bunch of games in a row,” 
Pastujov said. “I think we 
were also big because pretty 
much all of the points we got 
were on even-
strength goals. 
I think those 
are 
important 
in a game that 
might 
not 
have as many 
penalties.”
That 
experience 
has 
helped 
him transition 
to 
a 
more 
prominant presence on the 
ice this season as a member 
of the special teams unit. 
Against Waterloo, Pastujov 
scored early in the first period 
after two canceling penalities 
resulted 
in 
four-on-four 
hockey. A day earlier against 
Vermont, he notched a game-

tying, power play goal at 10:18 
in the first period.
Beyond producing on the 
ice, 
though, 
perhaps 
the 
biggest leap that Pastujov has 
made was mental rather than 
physical.
“I 
think 
he 
finally got some 
confidence,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 
“And 
what 
comes 
first? 
Confidence and 
then you have 
a 
good 
game? 
Or do you have 
a 
good 
game 
and build some confidence 
off that? I think he had 
good games and he got some 
confidence and that just went 
right into his finish last year.”
That 
question 
is 
now 
a 
season-long 
one 
rather 
than a game-by-game one. 
Pastujov got his foot in the 

door and now has a chance to 
hold it open as a key part of 
Michigan’s roster.
Will 
the 
forward 
find 
confidence from his start and 
continue his level of play, or 
will he let his play dictate 
his 
level 
of 
confidence? 
Either way, he 
plans to use his 
determination 
as 
the 
main 
indicator 
of 
his season over 
anything else.
“I 
want 
to get faster 
and 
I 
want 
to 
get 
more 
competitive,” Pastujov said. “I 
want to really go into battles 
and win every single one-on-
one. I don’t want to lose any 
battles. I don’t want to lose 
any faceoff. I just want to 
bring in a new level of speed 
in my game that brings us to 
the next level.”

Wolverines top OSU

The stage was set for a Friday 
night showdown between the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
(6-6 overall, 2-3 Big Ten) and Ohio 
State (6-4-1, 3-1-1). The Wolverines 
snapped their two-game losing 
streak with a 1-0 victory.
The 
Wolverines 
held 
the 
Buckeyes shotless for the first 15 
minutes, dominating them. An 
opportunity came for Michigan 
with 22 minutes left to play in the 
first half, senior forward Reilly 
Martin sent a bending cross into 
the box with freshman Raleigh 
Loughman’s head as the target. 
Loughman’s header hit off the far 
post and rolled horizontally across 
the goal line. The call on the field 
was a goal, but after video review 
the goal was overturned, and the 
game remained tied at zero.
“Just keep doing what we’re 
doing obviously, we’re creating 
a lot of good chances and so just 
stick with the game plan,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein. “I 
felt like we just needed to pick up 
our speed of play a little bit. We 
kind of dropped the pace of our 
pass but really just keep doing what 
we’re doing because it’s working 
and we’ll get one.”
After the called-off goal, the 
momentum swung in favor of Ohio 
State. A scoring chance came for 
the Buckeyes with three minutes 
left in the half, after a ball was 
played in behind the defense right 
to the feet of an Ohio State forward. 

Sophomore goalkeeper Hillary 
Beall came up with a diving kick 
save to keep the game tied at zero 
heading into half.
The Wolverines’ big break came 
just 13 minutes into the second half, 
when Martin sent another soaring 
cross into the box. Sophomore 
midfielder 
Nicki 
Hernandez 
headed the ball directly past the 
keeper.
“We worked on winning balls 
in and out of the air and once we 
regain the ball how does that spring 
into our attack, and really being 
much better about set pieces,” said 
Klein. “Prior to the game tonight, 
we’ve given up eight goals and five 
of them have been on set pieces. 
We spent a lot of time on how we 
need to be better about that.”
It was not smooth sailing for 
the Wolverines after this goal, 
though, because the Buckeyes had 
a handful of quality opportunities 
to even the score. The most 
dangerous of these chances came 
with 20 minutes left in the game, 
when an Ohio State forward got in 
behind the defense and Beall was 
forced to make another save with 
her knees. Beall earned her second 
shutout of the season, stopping all 
10 of the shots she faced.
“To really win big and be good 
you have to make sure that you 
don’t give goals up,” Klein said. 
“Really putting a big emphasis on 
being disciplined defensively and 
making sure that we don’t give 
away chance and I thought the 
defense and the goal keeper played 
great tonight.”

What do you believe?
I

t’s a 
tired 
ultima-
tum at this 
point: win 
these three 
games, and 
only then is 
the Michigan 
football team 
for real. Only 
then is Jim 
Harbaugh, 
after four years of manifest-
ing his all-star presence, the 
savior. 
With No. 15 Wisconsin roll-
ing into Ann Arbor on Satur-
day (opening as eight-point 
underdogs, mind you), fans are 
handling the game as a make-
or-break ordeal. The team is, 
too, and they’re talking about 
it. 
“This is one of those games 
you see on the schedule, you 
gotta get those first six games 
out of the way,” said junior 
linebacker Devin Bush Jr. “But 
you know this game is eventu-
ally coming, and now that it’s 
here, it’s all you’ve been wait-
ing for.”
The 12th-ranked Wolverines 
have talked big game of their 
potential in the past and fal-
tered. Why believe them now? 
Flashback to Aug. 29. Notre 
Dame awaits. 
“The reality is,” said assis-
tant head coach Pep Hamilton, 
“that everybody’s gonna find 
out who we are and what we’re 
made of on Saturday night.”
The Wolverines, of course, 
lost that game, 24-17. As of Oct. 
11, there is nary a word that 
Michigan is remotely the same 
team as the one that looked 
outmatched end-to-end in 
South Bend. 
The team has spoken in the 
same manner before, but not 
like it has now. Maybe it’s bul-
letin board material for them. 
But maybe, with momentum 
and genuine confidence in 
hand, there is truthful convic-
tion.

Ask the team’s emotional 
leader, defensive end Chase 
Winovich.
“It’s pretty obvious there’s 
something different about this 
team,” the fifth-year senior 
said.
Obvious. Ask another fifth-
year senior, Jared Wangler. 
“There is something spe-
cial with this team,” Wangler 
said. “You can feel it. I feel 
like we’re hitting on all cylin-
ders right now … confidence 
is there, which is really what 
you need, especially in these 
big games coming up. I sense 
something great about this 
team.”
Even Wisconsin’s head 
coach, Paul Chryst, can see it 
on film. 
“They have great confi-

dence and knowledge in their 
scheme,” Chryst said.
So now you have to consider 
for yourself if you believe the 
hype, or if the 
five games after 
Notre Dame 
were just a gift 
with a pretty 
bow on top. Can 
you put yourself 
on the bandwag-
on that a loss to 
the Badgers is 
devastating and, 
more impor-
tantly, unex-
pected? Leaving 
the Wolverines’ words to the 
wayside, the answer might still 
be “yes.”
Wisconsin, geared for a 
transcendent season, has been 

far from perfect. National title 
hopes vanished with a loss to 
BYU, and the Badgers’ patent-
ed roughneck defense has been 
suspect. Michi-
gan State has 
looked wholly 
unimpressive 
in all five of its 
games. Penn 
State’s offense 
is still at a Penn 
State level, but 
a near-loss to 
Appalachian 
State and three 
tight quarters 
against a down-
trodden Illinois have exposed 
chinks in the armor. 
Going 0-3 in this stretch, 
like last season, is possible. But 
it seems utterly more impos-

sible than winning them all at 
the moment, like two seasons 
ago. It’s a rejuvenated con-
fidence predictably built on 
the shoulders of Michigan’s 
newfound torchbearer: junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson. 
“There’s the preparation 
part there,” said running backs 
coach Jay Harbaugh of Pat-
terson. “And then there’s that 
kind of gut trust that this guy 
can make some stuff happen. 
Our team never feels like we’re 
out of it or we’re gonna lose 
or anything. But having a guy 
like that kinda amplifies it. You 
really feel like there’s nothing 
that can stop us because he’s 
so dangerous and able to make 
things happen.”
Added cornerbacks coach 
Mike Zordich, perhaps the 

most no-nonsense coach on 
the Wolverines’ staff: “They’re 
starting to feel comfortable 
with each other the system, 
and they’re playing together. 
… I think Shea has done a hell 
of a job of bringing everyone 
together on that side of the 
ball.”
The team goes as Patterson 
goes. Jim Harbaugh said that 
even his seven-year-old daugh-
ter Katie recognizes that. And 
with marked game-by-game 
improvement by Patterson, 
redshirt junior tight end Zach 
Gentry claims that he’s never 
been more confident in the 
offense and the team as a 
whole. It’s not as “fragment-
ed” like last year as Zordich 
believes. 
The experience, the hunger 
and the weight of every con-
fident syllable the team has 
uttered are there. And if you 
still don’t believe — if Har-
baugh’s play-calling causes you 
physical distress, if the offen-
sive line has every flaw we 
thought it did, if the defense 
takes too much time to settle 
in on Saturday or whatever else 
can happen — there is nothing 
that’s been said to suggest a 
loss is unavoidable. 
Or maybe the team under-
stands something that we 
don’t. 
“This is the part of the 
season where it defines your 
whole season and what your 
team wants to do,” Bush said. 
“We know how to beat teams 
like that. We know what it 
takes to beat teams like that.”
They’ve talked the talk. 
Now, with the hunt of a Big Ten 
Championship truly beginning 
with this three-game gauntlet, 
how those words present them-
selves will speak to the talent 
and mettle of this team. 
Are you convinced?

Zordich has another message for corners

In the vein of its head coach, 
the Michigan football program 
is usually tight-lipped around 
the media.
That is except for Michael 
Zordich, 
who 
has 
twice 
used 
press 
conferences 
at 
Schembechler Hall to call out 
players. In August of 2017, 
the secondary coach said his 
group was “scared to make 
plays” 
before 
questioning 
junior corner Lavert Hill’s 
willingness 
to 
practice 
through injury last spring.
Wednesday, 
Zordich 
was 
at it again. He challenged his 
freshman corners, Myles Sims, 
Gemon Green, Sammy Faustin 
and Vincent Gray.
“They need to grow up and 
get used to being in college 
and understand it’s a little 
different than being a four, 
five-star guy,” Zordich said. 
“You’re now a zero-star guy, 
start 
from 
the 
beginning, 
compete every day and get 
better.”
Even with an injury to 
redshirt freshman Benjamin 
St. 
Juste, 
the 
Wolverines 
returned a deep corner room 
from 2017. Barring injury, it 
would have been surprising to 
see any of those true freshmen 
receive regular playing time. 
Still, 
Zordich 
hasn’t 
been 
especially encouraged by their 
progress.
“They’ve got a long way to 
go,” Zordich said. “As long as 
they understand that, and they 
come here to work every day, 
they’ll be fine because they 
got talent. That’s why they’re 
here.
“They’ve got to earn their 
stripes.”
From 
last 
Fall 
Camp’s 
uncertainty, that’s what Hill 
and sophomore David Long 
did 
in 
starting 
roles 
the 
past two seasons. Michigan 
allowed the fewest passing 
yards nationally in 2017 — a 
mark it’s on pace for this year, 
allowing 134 yards per game.
In last Saturday’s win over 
Maryland, Brandon Watson 
made 
the 
group’s 
biggest 

play. The fifth-year senior 
undercut a slant route in the 
fourth quarter and returned 
it 46 yards for the game’s final 
touchdown.
It 
was 
Watson’s 
second 
interception of the season, 
furthering his role as a reliable 
third option for Zordich.
“Coach 
Brown and I — 
it’s funny, we 
watch film in 
the 
mornings 
from 
the 
night 
before 
— 
there’s 
(Watson) 
causing 
some kind of 
problems some 
way along the 
line in practice,” Zordich said. 
“It gets noticed.”
The 
Wolverines 
have 
occasionally used Watson in 
nickel sets, moving Hill or 
Long inside to cover the slot. 
But that’s not the bread and 
butter for No. 15 Wisconsin, 
which visit Ann Arbor on 

Saturday. 
Like 
Michigan, 
the Badgers are a run-first, 
smash-mouth offense. 
“They’ll get in these sets, 
it’s like rugby,” Zordich said. 
“Everybody’s in there real 
tight running the ball, and then 
all of sudden — boom — play 
action and they’re throwing 
all over. So the 
running 
game 
really 
sets 
up 
their 
passing 
game big-time.”
Zordich 
mentioned 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
focusing 
on 
forcing 
Wisconsin 
into 
predictable 
passing 
situations 
on 
third 
down. 
The presence of running back 
Jonathon Taylor — the Big 
Ten’s leading rusher with 849 
yards and eight touchdowns 
— and potentially the best 
offensive 
line 
in 
college 
football 
could 
make 
that 
difficult.

It’ll be strength-on-strength 
Saturday, as Michigan is one 
of eight teams nationally that 
allows less than 100 rushing 
yards per game.
“Yeah, that’s one thing as 
a defense we pride ourselves 
on: can’t run the ball, you 
gotta beat us passing,” said 
junior safety Josh Metellus 
on Tuesday. “Once get them in 
third down, that’s where we 
want to thrive as a defense. … 
So we just make sure a team 
can’t run the ball, get them in 
third-and-long, get our ends, 
D-tackles doing work.”
Wisconsin 
has 
the 
best 
rushing attack Michigan will 
see in the regular season. 
Though it won’t be the focal 
point in stopping the Badgers’ 
ground 
attack, 
Zordich’s 
group is still preparing for a 
tough battle. 
“These guys, they’re going 
to 
go 
north 
and 
south,” 
Zordich said. “For our corners 
and safeties on the edge, they 
got to fill the lanes. It’s going 
to be more of a challenge.”

‘M’ falls to Penn State

The ball edged just outside 
the reach of a Michigan defender 
straight into the path of Penn 
State’s Kristin Schnurr, who 
took two dribbles forward into 
the space in front of her. Her shot 
whistled low and hard past the 
keeper to the far post. The goal, 
in the 67th minute, tied Sunday’s 
game between the Nittany Lions 
and 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer team.
Fifteen minutes later, Penn 
State scored the game-winning 
goal in a similar fashion. Frankie 
Tagliaferri 
got 
behind 
the 
defense and curled a shot into 
the high near post. The 2-1 lead 
held for the Nittany Lions, as 
they improved their record to 
9-5 overall, 5-2 in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines (7-7, 3-4) 
fell back to .500, but there were 
silver linings for the team.
“As difficult as this loss is, 
I’m actually really proud of the 
way that our team played,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein. 
“I thought our first half was the 
best 45 minutes that our group 
has played since being here. I just 
felt like it was complete.”
In 
fact, 
Michigan 
did 
dominate the first half with four 
shots on goal and four corners. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Wolverines 

blanked Penn State in both 
categories. Most of the Michigan 
attack came from out wide — 
several dangerous crosses came 
from both sides, and senior 
winger Reilly Martin had three 
shots on goal.
“Yeah, it’s an area that we 
spent a lot of time on over the 
last couple of weeks because I 
think we have some strengths 
in that area with some of the 
players that are out wide,” Klein 
said. “And so I think that it’s 
just something that we’ve been 
working on.”
The high point of the first 
half, though, was the goal by 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Sarah 
Stratigakis in the ninth minute. 
Winning the ball off a Nittany 
Lions defender, she had a clear 
picture of goal 16 yards out. 
Coolly, she slotted the ball inside 
the far post beyond the reach of 
the keeper.
The goal was what kicked off 
Michigan’s dominant first half, 
and gave them the momentum 
for most of the game.
Momentum, though, changes. 
The Wolverines lost it at the 
most critical time by letting in 
Schnurr’s goal. From then on, the 
game was all Penn State. With 
four shots and another goal, 
the pressure on Michigan was 
mounting — and the Wolverines 
could not recover.

and Lennon are to make new 
accommodations for those that 
rent. “We’re 24/7, too. We’ve had 
tango at 1:00 a.m … You provide a 
time, we provide access.”
As much as the studio is about 
cultivating a good vibe for those 
that stick around, there is an 
element of business to it. The 
studio adjacent to Openfloor, 
Créateur Studio, provides some 
guidance.
“The 
Créateur 
Studio 
supports Openfloor’s marketing 
and branding. We have these 
two studios that work together 
to empower people and their 
passions,” Prendi said.
Créateur Studio’s approach to 
marketing is manifold.
“We walk them through the 
early steps as we’ve developed 
this business and others, so we 
can give that support as well,” 
Lennon said. “We help them 
with marketing and curating 
their content for social media. 
We 
do 
some 
professional 
photography as well. The whole 
idea would be to support these 
local startups and give them 
whatever assistance they need.”
The 
business 
acumen 
of 
Créateur shines, then, in the way 
that its tenants are allowed to 
approach their students and the 
topic of wellness.
The eagerness of Openfloor for 
new business and opportunity is 
related by Lennon and Prendi’s 
entrepreneurial 
approach. 
Throughout our conversation, 
Prendi underscored how those 
who come to use the space are 
teachers and entrepreneurs.
“(Openfloor) 
is 
actually 
entrepreneurship,” Prendi said. 
“More than yoga, it’s a space 
(that) provides all the amenities. 
Not everyone wants to become 
an entrepreneur or start their 
own business, but with us, they 
can. Everyone that joins here 

has the passion to practice their 
art.”
While yoga classes do seem 
like Openfloor’s most conscious 
and deliberate projects, the 
flexibility of the space keeps 
everyone 
around. 
Siada 
mentioned how the freedom of 
the studio keeps things light and 
fun.
“The kind of students that 
come to Nak*d Yoga are people 
from the community, students, 
people who have practiced yoga 
for ages that want to come to 
a place and those don’t want 
to feel like they have to join a 
studio that promotes a cult.”
As 
mentioned 
previously, 
Openfloor’s 
concept 
has 
matured over a year and a half. 
By and large, most of its business 
comes from tenants that sign on 
for an extended period of time, 
but Lennon mentions a few one-
off events that were unique.
“There was a juggling class 
over the summer that was 
experimental … mixed with 
various other exercises that were 
off the cuff. (The hosts) brought 
pool noodles in and jousted with 
them,” Lennon said.
Throughout 
this 
process, 
Lennon and Prendi agree that 
journey has taught them to be 
resilient.
“Once our instructors start 
meeting 
one 
another, 
it’s 
stronger than doing it alone. In 
an industry like yoga or dance, 
it’s not always beautiful days,” 
Prendi said. “We’re trying to 
build that resiliency. Success 
does not come in one day. It’s 
about doing the right thing and 
we’re here to help.”
Lennon 
agreed. 
“We’re 
learning every day and trying to 
progress.”
The best way to approach 
personal health and wellness, 
then, is to calculate the costs and 
benefits of your current options, 
and spot the opportunities to 
innovate based on your own 
personal needs. Part of the 
brand of stylish wellness that 
has developed over the past few 
years is about conforming to a 
certain standard (Paltrow would 
gently call it “aspiring”), but it 
doesn’t have to be like that.
Some instructors, like Porter 
and Siada, agree the current 
brand of wellness impedes the 
vibe of a class and makes the 
space self-conscious instead of 
self-determined.
“The 
collaborative 
nature 
of our group is the kind of 
community is what we want 
to build. We don’t want any 
competition,” Siada said.
I stepped out onto State Street 
feeling refreshed, invigorated 
by the openness of the studio 
and the attitudes of Prendi and 
Lennon. A gym membership 
suddenly felt a lot like a marriage 
certificate — and why would 
I commit to something while 
I’m so young? Perhaps, like a 
healthy attitude about love, 
wellness should be thought of 
as an ongoing experience, not an 
objective.
“Everything 
else,” 
Siada 
said, referring to Nak*d Yoga 
as we were wrapping up over 
the phone, “extra branding or 
money, that’s all sometimes nice 
but unnecessary and, a lot of 
times — completely irrelevant.”

A different approach to feel good at Openfloor

The 
wellness 
industry 
is 
booming. Brands like Gwyneth 
Paltrow’s 
Goop 
and 
Jessica 
Alba’s Honest Company have 
made the act of being healthy, 
whatever that may mean to you, 
into both an experience and an 
aesthetic. An outfit consisting of 
a sweatshirt and yoga pants can 
be chic and stylish — it shows 
you’re taking care of yourself 
while also not taking yourself 
too seriously. A bare-faced look 
can work, too — show them how 
you radiate that healthy glow. 
The popularity of brands like 
Lululemon and Glossier reflects 
this trend toward the seemingly 
natural and unselfconscious.
Because there is no “right” 
way to be well, however, different 
brands can impose a multitude of 
standards on the public. Going 
to the gym Monday through 
Thursday in his old, white New 
Balances might be enough for 
your dad, but for a younger 
demographic, the optics are a 
little more important. Behind 
a trip to the gym is a planned 
outfit, followed by a smoothie, 
taken from a recipe on a wellness 
blog, and then maybe a shower 
and a couple of steps in a skincare 
routine.
For those who can afford it, 
being healthy is as easy as building 
that wardrobe or shopping for 
the right ingredients. For those 
who can’t, wellness is constantly 
just out of reach, hidden behind a 
high price tag or someone asking 
you to buy a fitness plan. Paltrow 
herself, in an interview with The 
New York Times Magazine, has 
said, “‘It’s crucial to me that we 
remain aspirational. Our stuff is 
beautiful. The ingredients are 
beautiful. You can’t get that at a 
lower price point. You can’t make 
these things mass-market.’”
Openfloor Studio, located on 
State Street, seeks to change 
that 
approach. 
Upstairs, 
between Totoro and The Getup 
Vintage, the studio is a wide, 
long, rectangular room with 
white walls. There are three air 
conditioners, three mirrors on 
the wall opposite the door and 
three window panes from which 
sunlight from the street pours 
in. It’s one of those perfectly 
nondescript spaces that you 
want to stand in: bright, open, 
bigger than it seems. When I 
arrive to talk with Zack Lennon 
and Gjergji Prendi, two of the 
founders of Openfloor, one of 
their renters is meditating alone 
with the blinds closed. I decide 
not to disturb her.
My 
initial 
impression 
of 
Openfloor was that it was a yoga 
studio only, but Lennon and 
Prendi are quick to refine my 
definition.
“The vision that we have 
is to build this ever-changing 
calendar of local events, local 
instructors and to provide a 
variety of classes in one space 
that are affordable for students 
and 
instructors,” 
Lennon 
said. “To have a variety, we’re 
pushing for this start-up idea 
for instructors, so if there’s a 

new student here that recently 
got certified in yoga and wants 
to start their own movement. 
This gives them the opportunity 
without signing a lease or signing 
their life away.”
The space, however, did start 
with a yoga emphasis.
“It was a blank slate,” Lennon 
said. “We got the space before we 
had the final business plan sorted. 
We had a full yoga schedule and 
that put the vision of Openfloor 
in the wrong direction.”
Part of redirecting the vision 
of Openfloor involved putting 
an emphasis on classes outside 
of yoga. Currently, its monthly 
schedule 
includes 
Tango, 
Bachata and Kizomba dance 
classes, on top of a regular 
schedule of yoga classes taught 
by a group of instructors called 
Nak*d Yoga.
Kara Porter, a member of 
Nak*d Yoga, spoke about her 
experience at Openfloor.
“It’s 
a 
very 
mellow 
atmosphere. You can just tell 
the vibes are different,” she said. 
“Other studios, you show up and 
everyone has Lululemon and 
crazy expensive stuff. There’s 
a lot of pressure. There’s a 
complete release of pressure (at 
Openfloor). It’s really nice.”
Another member of Nak*d 
Yoga, Ruby Siada, joined The 
Daily in a phone interview to 
speak about her time developing 
the group within the community 
of Openfloor. Siada emphasized 
how Nak*d Yoga’s donation-
based approach to the art assists 
the way that she teaches.
“You could have a class that’s 
filled and only make it out with 
$20, or have a class of two and 
come out with $100,” Siada 
said. “It’s very variable, but the 
amazing thing is it allows you 
to meet people where they’re at 
instead of forcing people to come 

to you. The opportunity to spend 
$0 to have yoga be a part of their 
life is huge.”
Nak*d Yoga’s approach to 
wellness, 
then, 
is 
markedly 
different from most health and 
wellness centers. Most gyms 
or studios requires purchasing 
a 
package 
or 
membership, 
which for some 
impose 
a 
price 
on 
wellness 
before they even 
engage with it, 
and thus builds a 
barrier. With the 
pursuit of profit 
comes 
branding 
and 
marketing 
strategies, which 
isn’t to say that 
Nak*d 
Yoga 
isn’t building a 
business. Rather, 
it’s just that the 
group’s business 
doesn’t 
come 
before the space 
and the practice. 
The 
walls 
of 
Openfloor studio 
are a stark white, 
and the only thing 
that comes close to branded 
merchandise is a small table that 
is covered in class schedules and 
business cards. Otherwise, the 
space is begging for something to 
take place.
“The entire point of Nak*d 
Yoga is to strip yoga to its 
roots, so we don’t realy have 
merchandise, 
membership 
fees, walk-in fees, contracts or 
continuously pushing ourselves 
onto people,” Siada said. It 
also 
facilitates 
collaboration 
between teachers and tenants 
instead of competition. “We 
have some people working full-
time, others working in their 
professions, 
we 
have 
some 

students. Our decisions are very 
much influenced by different 
perspectives. It’s pretty cool for 
our studio. We’re all on the same 
status level, though — we have no 
lead teachers or anything.”
It’s that freedom of the studio 
that Siada finds important to her 
practice.
“You 
can 
take 
the 
space 
and 
use 
it 
to 
create 
whatever 
atmosphere 
you 
want, 
whatever 
vibe you want,” 
Siada 
explained. 
“It is one of those 
things, you know, 
if the studio is run 
by the right people 
then the practice 
that comes out of 
it is going to be 
the practice you 
want. There’s no 
ego involved in 
Openfloor.”
Prendi echoed 
Siada’s feelings.
“Our 
motto 
is ‘The floor is 
yours,’” 
Prendi 
said. 
“Everyone 
that has an idea can use our 
space to come and start their 
idea with as much support as 
we can provide. As a concept, 
we’re not trying to narrow it 
down to one thing. We do know 
that some people just want to do 
yoga here, and Openfloor is just 
a starting point. We try to build 
a community vibe around here, 
because usually (patrons) follow 
the instructor, not the studio.”
The 
community 
vibe 
is 
essential at Openfloor. Lennon, 
Prendi, Porter and Siada all 
emphasized the escape from ego 
that comes with the create-your-
own-pace attitude of Openfloor. 
Prendi mentioned how eager he

I don’t smoke weed. Few 
things terrify me more than the 
idea of ingesting a substance 
whose origins I know nothing 
about, and I know as much 
about marijuana as your friendly 
neighborhood Church Lady.
When I first heard about 
the emergence of cosmetics 
with cannabidiol, or CBD, I 
was perplexed. I knew the 
substance had something to do 
with cannabis. In my mind, that 
meant labs full of dermatologists 
grinding up the stuff my friends 
put in their bongs, only to 
sprinkle it into a lotion or lip 
balm.
Needless to say, I was wrong. 
The story of CBD is far more 
complex than I ever could have 
imagined. This is my journey 
with cannabidiol skin care, made 
possible by extensive research 
and a beauty brand called Hora.
The 
CBD 
Movement: 
A 
Timeline
Cannabidiol 
is 
one 
of 
several 
compounds 
found 
in 
cannabis. 
Along 
with 
tetrahydrocannabinol, 
the 
“high”-inducing 
compound 
THC, it makes up about 40 
percent of the plant’s extract. 
In western culture, CBD has 
been lauded for its therapeutic 
properties dating back to the 
19th century; it’s rumored that 
Queen 
Victoria 
used 
CBD-
rich cannabis to alleviate her 
menstrual cramps.
Cannabidiol 
wasn’t 
individually 
extracted 
until 
1940, when American chemist 
Roger 
Adams 
became 
the 
first person to separate the 
compound from the plant using 
a mixture of ethanol and “red 
oil.” Six years later, Dr. W.S. 
Loewe performed the first CBD 
tests on lab animals, through 
which he discovered ingestion 
of the compound does not 
produce an altered mental state. 
Scientific interest in CBD slowed 
in the following decades until 
its three-dimensional structure 
was identified, opening a field 
of research devoted to exploring 
CBD’s potential uses. Studies in 
the ’70s and ’80s cited CBD as 
reducing nausea and vomiting 
caused 
by 
chemotherapy, 
producing 
sedative 
effects 
and diminishing convulsions 
in epileptic individuals. From 
the ’90s into the first decade of 
the new millennium, CBD was 
found to hold anti-inflammatory 
and calming properties, even 
boasting the ability to ease 
chronic pains of neurological 
origin.
Today, CBD oil supplements 
made from hemp are permitted 
in all 50 states so long as 
they’re produced under the 
provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill. 
Four years after its technical 
legalization, the compound has 
garnered widespread use as 
a treatment for physical pain, 
anxiety and depression, but new 
developments have also seen its 
incorporation into the beauty 
industry. Enter Hora Skin Care, 
a Los Angeles-based company 
that secured its place on the CBD 
bandwagon from its inception 
in Jan. At present, its inventory 
consists of the Super Serum and 
the Overnight Exfoliating Mask, 

both of which contain CBD, 
along with facial rollers in rose 
quartz, clear quartz and jade.
“I 
actually 
have 
another 
company called Punch Edibles 
in the medical marijuana, now 
recreational marijuana, market 
here in Cali. I’ve been around 
THC and CBD for quite a long 
time,” 
Samantha 
Czubiak, 
founder and CEO of Hora, told 
The Daily regarding her choice 
to use CBD in her products. 
“It 
became 
introduced 
into 
my skin care because I had a 
ton of products on my counter 
and every day I would try to 
figure out, like, ‘OK, so now I 
need to worry about pimples,’ 
or ‘Today I need to worry 
about brightening,’ and all this 
different stuff. I was always 
concocting stuff in my hand, 
and I was like, ‘Why not create 
something all in one?’ While I 
was doing a lot of research on 
the active ingredients that I 
knew I already liked, I started 
looking into CBD as a benefit to 
anti-aging or extra antioxidants, 
as well as it’s an incredible anti-
inflammatory. So people are 
having a lot of success with it in 
acne.”
Czubiak’s 
claims 
didn’t 
come out of thin air. A 2014 
study from the Journal of 
Clinical 
Investigation 
found 
CBD behaves as an effective 
“sebostatic” 
and 
“lipostatic” 
agent, 
meaning 
it 
stifles 
secretion 
of 
acne-producing 
gunk in skin’s pores. The study 
also indicates CBD reduced 
inflammation 
when 
applied 
topically.
“I thought it was going to be 
a crucial ingredient in a really 
all-in-one product,” she said. 
Other ingredients in Hora’s 
Super Serum include rosehip 
oil and vitamin C, while the 
Exfoliating Mask contains the 
likes of salicylic acid and MCT 
oil, a supplement made from 
Medium-chain triglycerides fats 
thought to help fight Alzheimer’s 
disease. In addition to CBD, the 
products, which were conceived 
by Czubiak with guidance from 
a professional formulator, share 
vitamin A as another common 
ingredient.
The CBD Cynics
With every rising cosmetics 
trend comes a skeptic movement. 
Those who doubt CBD’s skincare 
benefits cite a lack of studies in 
the field. Meanwhile, existing 
research indicates less efficacy 
in CBD when it’s extracted from 
the greater cannabinoid system 
in isolation, a phenomenon that, 
according to The New York 
Times, has been dubbed the 
“entourage effect.”
Many CBD beauty brands, 
like Hora, employ this isolate, a 
decision that Czubiak defended.
“It’s the purest way to get 
it,” she explained. “There’s no 
other plant material in there 
or extra fats or lipids from the 
plant itself. You’re literally just 
getting the active ingredient 
that you want. It really is just a 
refined process, and then from 
there, it really just depends on 
what you’re using it for.”
The uncertainty doesn’t stop 
there. As The Times points out, 
there is more CBD in cannabis 
strains containing THC than 
in hemp, but only CBD derived 
from 
hemp 
can 
be 
legally 
distributed. This could result 

in 
pain-relieving 
and 
anti-
inflammatory effects that are 
less magnitudinous than CBD 
superfans make them out to be.
Not only that, in addition, 
there is no evidence for what an 
effective dosage of CBD would be 
for treatment of skin conditions 
like acne. What scientists do 
know is a higher dosage seems 
to signal more potent results. An 
article from California nonprofit 
Project CBD reports, “Studies 
have established that synthetic, 
single-molecule CBD has a very 
narrow therapeutic window and 
requires precise, high doses for 
efficacy.”
The question then arises: 
What constitutes a high dose 
of CBD? A 2017 study from 
the Journal of the American 
Medical 
Association 
showed 
of 84 different CBD products 
analyzed, 
the 
average 
concentration 
for 
CBD 
products was 30.96 mg per 
mL. Compare that to the 250 
mg/oz of CBD in Hora’s Super 
Serum and 422 mg/50mL in 
the 
Overnight 
Exfoliating 
Mask. That said, Hora has very 
low concentrations of CBD in 
their products compared to the 
average.
All things considered, most 
mainstream 
dermatologists 
have yet to get onboard with the 
CBD push.
“There may be some promise 
for 
future 
use,” 
Jeffrey 
Orringer, chief of the cosmetic 
dermatology division at the 
University, 
said 
regarding 
the 
potential 
advantages 
of 
CBD skin care. “But it is too 
early to determine the safety 
and efficacy of many of these 
products 
because 
rigorous 
studies are generally lacking in 
this area.”
She Really Tried It
When Hora’s public relations 
coordinator 
reached 
out 
to 
me asking if I’d be interested 
in sampling their products, I 
immediately signed on: This 
would be my time to put CBD’s 
claims to the test. After receiving 
my samples in the mail, I got 
down to business, applying the 
Super Serum every morning and 
night for two weeks, swapping 
it out for the Exfoliating Mask 
a total of three times — the 
package notes it can be used up 
to four times a week.
Most days, I applied the 
products with my Hora-branded 
jade facial roller after cleansing 
with Cetaphil wash. The roller 
is said to promote absorption of 
the products, reduce under eye 
circles and stimulate collagen, 
the skin’s elasticity agent. This 
is not an article about jade 
rollers, so I will keep my praises 
to a minimum, but that little 
gadget was especially useful 
for massaging my sinuses when 
flu season came for my immune 
system.
The Super Serum has a thin 
consistency 
and 
comes 
out 
milky white. Though both dye- 
and fragrance-free, it emits a 
noticeable scent that I’ll call 
“earthy” for our purposes. The 
Exfoliating Mask is a similar 
color, though slightly runnier 
with a less discrete smell. Both 
were easy to apply, and I was 
left with no sticky residue after 
using the roller atop my product-
covered pores.
During this two-week period, 

I documented my skin care 
procedures each day, reporting 
significant 
changes 
in 
my 
skin. Below, I’ve rounded up 
some of my most noteworthy 
observations:
Night 1 - Sept. 22: Smell is 
subtle but a little funky and 
vaguely fungal, kind of like the 
high school biology classroom 
the day of the sheep brain 
dissection.*
Morning 4 - Sept. 26: When I 
woke up, my formerly giant lip 
zit no longer hurt, its whitehead 
was gone. Less large, but still 
red.
Morning 10 - Oct. 2: Chacne 
looks so much better!
I went on several skin-picking 
rampages while testing Hora’s 
products. 
Evidence 
of 
each 
almost completely faded over 
the course of a good night’s 
sleep.
“I’ve had tons of positive 
feedback from the product,” 
Czubiak said. “I think just 
statistically, people are always 
scared 
or 
the 
marijuana 
industry doesn’t get the credit 
it really does deserve. I think 
it’s just going to take a long 
time 
with 
THC 
and 
CBD 
products to really be recognized 
in 
mainstream 
beauty 
or 
mainstream pharmaceuticals. I 
mean, I just heard the other day 
that there was a CBD drug that’s 
the first FDA-approved drug out 
there, so I think we’re making 
waves, and we’ll start to hear 
more positive things coming out 
about CBD, especially. It really 
is a rockstar product, honestly.”
My foray into Hora’s CBD-
rich regimen has given me no 
reason to disagree. I’ve seen 
the texture of my skin improve 
in a remarkably short time. 
My cheeks, once covered in 
miniscule bumps, are now silky-
smooth aside from a few small 
areas of inflammation. Plus 
— and I’m fully aware of how 
silly this sounds — my face feels 
brighter now. I even received 
several compliments on my 
“natural glow” throughout my 
trial run.
In Conclusion
I 
love 
Hora’s 
products. 
Whether CBD is the reason 
they’re effective is beyond me, 
but frankly, I don’t really care.
In 
most 
CBD 
skin 
care 
products 
on 
the 
market, 
cannabidiol is one of several 
ingredients, 
most 
of 
which 
have benefits more generally 
accepted than CBD’s. Czubiak 
echoed these sentiments:
“I would say that we’ve 
created just a master formula, 
and CBD is just one of the 
ingredients, honestly. I started 
with, 
I 
was 
getting 
really 
obsessed with hyaluronic acid 
and argan oil … I feel like I was 
way more focused on making it a 
complete product and what else 
was going to go into before I was 
really like, ‘OK, CBD and just 
throw whatever else in there.’”
Czubiak is not a scientist, nor 
does she masquerade as one. 
That doesn’t change the fact that 
Hora’s products deliver exactly 
what they promise: a fast-acting, 
naturally-derived solution to 
acne and inflammation. They 
also just so happen to contain 
CBD. 
*In retrospect, this was a 
dramatic exaggeration. I stopped 
noticing the smell by day three.

B-SIDE SECONDARY
My Pet Rocks: 
A journey with 
healing crystals

I’m sitting in the testing 
accommodation center, flicking 
my pencil and worrying about 
the exam I’m about to take. I 
open my glasses case, slide on 
my glasses and pick out my two 
stones — usually an emerald and 
a tiger’s eye.
I have severe anxiety, but 
luckily, I have my stones.
Since I can remember, I have 
lived around stones, crystals 
and rocks. My homeopathic, 
Buddhist dad raised me with 
this form of healing, and it’s a 
significant part of my identity 
and spiritual practice. An active 
stone-bracelet 
wearer 
and 
crystal-pocket carrier, he knew 
that my sister and I needed good 
energy, and that we needed a 
type of healing that strayed from 
modern medicine.
I had crystals everywhere: 
my nightstand, my backpack, 
my swim bag, my glasses case. 
I would rub them when I 
had stressful exams to take, I 
would play with them before 
my races. When I got serious 
about meditation practices, I 
began to meditate with them 
in my palms or right beside me. 
No one understood my unique 
rock collection or the energy it 
cultivated.
When I asked my 
dad to talk about 
his 
journey 
with 
healing crystals, he 
told me he was not 
necessarily the right 
person to speak with. 
A dear friend of his 
and an alternative, 
homeopathic healer, 
Carrie 
Hamilton, 
was 
indeed 
the 
expert. 
Launching 
her 
own 
practice 
and 
specializing 
in 
flowers, 
gem 
and light essences, 
chakra based healing 
and energy medicine, 
Hamilton’s journey 
with 
the 
natural 
world has led her to 
spread her powers 
with others.
“I 
remember 
playing with them 
when I was a kid. I 
was drawn to stones 
and rocks and nature. My mom 
was always into gemstones and 
she was an artist, so I was always 
around colors,” Hamilton said 
in an interview with The Daily. 
After dabbling with crystals 
and energy healing in college, 
Hamilton decided to pursue it 
further and more intensely after 
experiencing her own health 
issues.
“I started studying chakras 
and found out there are certain 
stones related to certain organ 
troubles … you can lay stones 
on your body for certain parts 
of 
your 
system,” 
she 
said. 
Many think the idea of healing 
crystals is a bunch of bologna, 
but Hamilton replied that the 
more she studied it, “the more 
(she) found out how ancient this 
practice is.”
One of the earliest records 
of crystal and stone uses can be 
traced back to Ancient Egypt, 
where they used them as a 
form of decorative wear and 
symbols of wealth. Over time, 
crystals and stones made their 
way through Europe and Asia, 
where communities began using 
them for medicinal and spiritual 
practices.
But it’s a different world for 
those of us who were raised 
with modern, Western medicine. 
Crystal healing doesn’t work as 
simply as taking a pill or getting 
a shot. As living, breathing 
creatures, crystals should be 
nurtured with our own energy 
and vice versa. They involve 
communication and care, as 
one would have with a pet or a 
plant. Hamilton mentioned that 
different “frequencies of a stones 
and densities of crystals” is what 
we can most resonate with. But 
it’s subjective.

“I learned how to work 
with colors and stones with 
corresponding 
challenges,” 
Hamilton said. These challenges 
can vary from person to person. 
For example, if one feels sadness 
or an overwhelming heartbreak, 
rose quartz can help lighten that 
emotional 
weight. 
Carnelian 
serves as an energy booster and 
can help find the strength within 
ourselves. Depending on what 
people need, crystals provide 
an energy to heal our chakra or 
emotional imbalances.
One of the most important 
aspects to crystal healing is 
finding ones that work best for 
you. Each person is drawn to 
certain stones for various reasons, 
including the stones’ color, shape, 
texture and radiating energy. 
Hamilton emphasized trusting 
that luring instinct because there 
is something in the subconscious 
mind that needs a certain crystal 
for a certain purpose. Regardless 
of our internal or external 
healing needs, crystals can show 
immense changes to our mind, 
body and soul.
“I encourage people that, 
if they’re traveling, to pick up 
a rock or stone, even from the 
ocean of the side of the road,” she 
said. “I’m always fascinated to 
see the different types of stones 
that you could find.”
After my dad introduced me to 
crystals, I gradually found myself 
instinctually 
picking 
up 
sea 
glass 
from 
the ocean or shiny 
rocks on hiking trails. 
Despite 
knowing 
their potential power, 
I’m drawn to certain 
stones 
for 
specific 
reasons, 
quickly 
adding them to my 
spiritual rock family.
If 
the 
concept 
of 
“using” 
healing 
crystals 
still 
feels 
funky, Hamilton also 
makes mala jewelry: 
a string of different 
stones, crystals and 
rocks that is used in 
spiritual 
practices, 
similar to the use of a 
rosary. Just by having 
the mala beads around 
your wrist and sharing 
your energy with it, 
these beads can have a 
positive effect on your 
thoughts 
and 
your 
aura.
I’ll 
hold 
my 
citrine 
in 
meditation, play around with 
larimar in my pocket before 
an interview and I’ll sit with 
my quartz in the bathtub. Just 
like medicine, crystals serve 
different functions in a method 
that feels so natural, so ineffable. 
Here, I can feel a change in their 
temperatures, the vibrational 
pull and push they have in my 
hands. My crystals make me feel 
more grounded and connected to 
the natural world.
“When you realize the core 
of the Earth is made of (rocks) 
and is affecting it, how could 
we also not be affected by these 
crystals?” she asked.
After 
the 
interview 
with 
Hamilton, I look to my crystals 
sitting on a clear plate near my 
bedroom window. I close my eyes 
and try to embrace the energy 
that is currently circulating 
in my very own room. “People 
forget that (crystals) are like 
plants. They are growing and 
shifting. It’s just a much slower 
process than we are used to 
seeing,” Hamilton said.
I face challenges each day 
knowing that I am growing with 
each mistake or stressful event 
that comes my way. Yet, there 
are my crystals, in their dish, 
bathing in sunlight. They’ve 
always been there, sharing their 
energy, healing me and growing 
alongside me.
“Be playful. Enjoy it. Get back 
to that childhood state of really 
connecting without judgment. 
They (stones) absolutely respond 
to our affection, our conversation, 
and our connection with them … 
It’s that living energy that we are 
part of it and helps us feel that 
oneness again.”

I’ve 
never 
heard 
anyone 
complain about a grilled cheese 
sandwich. 
Even 
the 
most 
cumbersome and uninspiring cook 
— the kind that spikes your blood 
pressure when you watch them 
because their sleeve is dangling 
just a tad too close to the flame, who 
may not even know how to cook 
scrambled eggs without burning 

them — can make a grilled cheese 
taste good. Two ingredients for a 
whole five minutes of happiness.
But, eating a grilled cheese is 
just as easy as making it. What if 
this basic unit of melting goodness 
could be used to inspire social 
change? That’s where FeelGood 
comes into play.
FeelGood is a national volunteer 
movement working to end world 
poverty by 2030. Their vehicle 
to do so is the grilled cheese. At 
the University, FeelGood is a 

student organization that delivers 
handmade sandwiches to locations 
on central campus for a donation 
ranging from three to five dollars. 
All of the profits go toward 
eradicating world poverty. It’s that 
simple.
“World hunger is a problem 
that seems insurmountable and 
daunting,” Ross School of Business 
senior and co-president of the 
University’s

Incandescence & Horror 
Porn: To my hairdresser

COURTESY OF FEELGOOD

Nola’s Underground Salon is a 
feel-good sort of place in its own 
right. It’s demurely tucked in the 
basement beneath that random 
food court on North U., requiring 
patrons to deliver themselves from 
the commercial madness above 
when they descend the otherwise 
overlooked 
staircase 
between 
Mezes and Silvio’s. The studio itself 
is much like a womb, wrapped in 
velvet fleur-de-lis wallpaper and 
perpetually bumping some sort of 
warm, spacy noise. My hairdresser 
Nick owns the only bald head I 
have ever considered gorgeous and 
is always garnished in harem pants 
that emphasize his alarmingly 
clear eyes. Going to Nola’s has 
evidently 
become 
a 
spiritual 
experience for me, and I was really 
searching for some relief when I 
crawled down there last Friday, 
feeling utterly shackled by social 
anxiety and Brett Kavanaugh.
Nick, 
being 
the 
mythical 
creature he is, picked up on my 
funk and steered our conversation 
into some revitalizing book talk. 
Somewhere along that path, we got 
into “weird little books,” and his 
entire demeanor seemed shot with 
lightning as he recalled Georges 
Bataille’s novella “Story of the 
Eye.” He needed me to read it.
“It’s written by this crazy 
fucking French librarian,” he 
explained, “but I really shouldn’t 
tell you any more. I used to hand 
it out to my students at the end 
of the semester with an album 
I find rather complementary.” 
That was unique. I asked what 
artist. He replied, “Have you 
listened to of Montreal?” and 
something in my brain exploded. 
Too many wonderful things were 
intersecting right when I needed 
them to. I ordered the book right 
then and there.
“Story of the Eye” is porn. 
And it’s no standard porn — it’s 
sensationally messy, impressively 
constant, 
poetically 
visual, 
overwhelmingly excessive, often 
demonic porn that is constantly, 
constantly flirting with death (if not 
fucking it outright). In its mere 80 
wild pages, the unnamed narrator 
and his main squeeze, Simone, 
manage to write some Kama Sutra 
from hell as a secondary byproduct 
of the relentless pursuit of their 

most unrefined desire. Simone 
and 
Bataille-through-narrator 
boast unfathomable stamina and 
ambition, managing to throw an 
almost satirically obscene orgy 
and execute a full-on asylum 
break, naked, on bikes, in the first 
few chapters. Someone almost 
dies, 
someone 
definitely 
dies 
and a host of others continue to 
die as Simone and the Narrator 
Boi somehow take their lethal 
debauchery abroad, where it is 
simultaneously 
nourished 
by 
and unleashed upon the headiest 
of landscapes: bullfights during 
the day, cathedrals at night. The 
repeated demonstration of this 
relationship 
between 
physical 
and/or material destruction and 
raw sexual energy is some literary 
Ouroboros — create and destroy, 
nourish and damage, turn on and 
turn off, but above all cycle, cycle, 
cycle because, for Simone and 
Narrator Boi, at least, it all seems to 
average out to infinity anyway.
“The 
goal 
of 
my 
sexual 
licentiousness,” 
explains 
Narrator Boi, “(is) a geometric 
incandescence 
(among 
other 
things, the coinciding point of life 
and death, being and nothingness), 
perfectly fulgurating.”
Holy shit. The last thing I’ve read 
that presented “incandescence” 
as a character goal was Virginia 
Woolf’s “A Room of One’s Own.” 
Beneath its indisputably singular 
delivery, there’s some kernel of 
fiery nirvana in “Story of the Eye” 
that it shares with literature-at-
large. These kids are trying to 
transcend. Forget good — they 
want 
incandescent. 
Perfectly 
fulgurating. This is how they do it.
This canonically routine theme 
can certainly get lost in the genre 
sauce. Pornography is seldom 
considered “literature” at all, let 
alone fertile field for transcendence 
stories. Bataille’s novella, with 
its innumerable perversions and 
taboos, takes it a step further 
in terms of accessibility. In a 
particularly 
keen 
moment 
of 
reflection, 
Bataille’s 
narrator 
seems to anticipate this exact 
interpretive 
hurdle, 
explaining 
with some encouraging judgment 
that, “to others, the universe seems 
decent because decent people have 
gelded eyes. That is why they fear 
lewdness … In general, people savor 
the ‘pleasures of the flesh’ only on 
condition that they be insipid.”
Luckily, there exists a trove 

of amazingly helpful theory on 
pornographic literature to dissolve 
some of these insidious barriers of 
convention, and perhaps embolden 
us to embrace some new flavor. 
In her essay “The Pornographic 
Imagination,” which references 
and is often included in critical 
editions of “Story of the Eye,” 
Susan Sontag taps into the unique 
power of porn: “the physical 
sensations involuntarily produced 
in someone reading the book carry 
with them something that touches 
upon the reader’s whole experience 
of humanity — and his limits as a 
personality and a body.”
The thrill of pushing it. We do 
this all the time: It’s the arguably 
masochistic euphoria of writing 
a thesis, fighting through a long 
run, giving or getting an awesome 
hickey. Corpse pose at the end of 
the specific agony that is hot yoga. 
Overwhelming the senses tends 
to shock them into a brand new 
sense of their own, and this style 
of writing captures that. It would 
be hypocritical if that were not 
“literature.”
“Story of the Eye,” without a 
doubt, is a whole different sort 
of “pushing it.” Writing a thesis 
and necrophilia aren’t exactly 
comparable. To this, I say poetry: 
Bataille is pushing our literary 
senses, rousing us with so many 
scandals that they seem to molt 
their literal meaning, instead 
operating as vector-like stimuli 
that culminate in destroying our 
idea of what we can possibly feel 
while reading something. Sontag, 
expectedly, is a little more cerebral 
about horror-porn, explaining that:
“Human beings … live only 
through excess. And pleasure 
depends on ‘perspective,’ or giving 
oneself to a state of ‘open being,’ 
open to death as well as to joy. Most 
people try to outwit their own 
feelings; they want to be receptive 
to pleasure but keep ‘horror’ at a 
distance. That’s foolish, according 
to Bataille, since horror reinforces 
‘attraction’ and excites desire.”
Pleasure 
and 
horror 
— 
Ouroboros 
2.0. 
Per 
my 
hairdresser’s recommendation, I 
began to listen for this exciting, 
excessive relationship in the music 
of of Montreal and was pleasantly 
surprised to find its undercurrent 
pulsing beneath wide swaths of 
their discography. The group’s 
frontman, Kevin Barnes, seems to 
have mastered the art of accepting 

VERITY STURM
For the Daily

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

grilled cheese sandwiches are 
super simple and easy. And people 
love food.”
Some may be skeptical of the 
monetary impact one sandwich 
can make, but about one half of the 
world lives off of less than $2.50 
per day. The international poverty 
line is currently set at $1.90 per day. 
About 820 million people suffer 
from world hunger. Anything and 
everything is helpful to bridge 
the international gap between the 
privileged and underprivileged.
“We can have such an impact 
with just one sandwich,” Demeter 
said. “People think, ‘If I’m not 
donating at least $100 then I’m 
not having an impact,’ and that 
prevents people from donating 
when 
really 
any 
amount 
is 
powerful and helpful.”
All the money FeelGood raises 
from grilled cheese sales goes 
toward the Commitment 2030 
Fund: a group of organizations 
that are dedicated to ending 
world poverty by the year 2030. 
A majority of the money raised 
within these organizations goes 
toward Asia, Africa and Latin 
America: places where the need 
is greatest. FeelGood is optimistic 
that the Commitment 2030 Fund 
can accomplish its goal.
“(World 
hunger) 
has 
been 
halved before, so I feel like it’s 
foreseeable to do it again,” LSA 
junior and marketing chair of 
FeelGood Dylan DeBaun said.
The Commitment 2030 Fund 
targets world poverty in an 
environmentally 
sustainable 
way instead of “handing-out” 
money, which often inspires no 
lasting change in an impoverished 
community. The Hunger Project, 
one of the organizations in the 
alliance, aims to eliminate world 
hunger in a self-reliant way by 
ensuring that agricultural and 
culinary skills taught to the 
community will be conserved 

through 
generations. 
The 
Pachamama Alliance works to 
reduce the risk of infant mortality 
by providing safe birthing kits 
to women in the Amazon and 
training them to be dulas, among 
other goals. FeelGood is proud to 
partner with organizations that 
prioritize sustainability instead of 
freely giving out money.
“If you go into a community 
and give them a water purification 
system — what happens if it 
breaks?” Demeter said. There’s 
almost no impact unless the 
community is taught how to 
maintain the system and can 
troubleshoot for problems. This 
type of lasting change is why 
FeelGood prefers to think of 
themselves as partnering with 
disadvantaged populations instead 
of viewing their donations as 
charity.
“We give a hand-up, not a hand-
out,” Demeter added.
It’s easy to stigmatize world 
hunger, especially living in the 
United States and even just in Ann 
Arbor.
It can be difficult to put 
yourself in the shoes of someone 
malnourished, and as a result 
many tend to look down on 
underprivileged individuals. As a 
student organization, FeelGood 
seeks to break down this stereotype 
by starting conversations with 
their customers and within their 
meetings.
“It’s inappropriate to call these 
countries ‘Third World Countries.’ 
There’s 
a 
hugely 
negative 
connotation with that,” Demeter 
said. “They’re born into this 
situation; it’s not in their control. 
They’re really just like us.”
Few realize that world poverty 
has 
a 
gender 
component 
as 
well: About 60 percent of those 
suffering from world hunger are 
women. This is largely due to the 
lack of resources female farmers 

have access to compared to their 
male counterparts. Women are 
often given less land to farm on, 
as well as fewer cattle and seeds. 
Many organizations that target 
world hunger focus on women 
specifically, and FeelGood is no 
exception.
“We’re 
a 
gender-based 
organization,” DeBaun said. “We 
focus on empowering women in 
other countries.” Often times, 
women are more involved in 
the community, as well as food 
production for their family unit. 
Lifting up women can lead to 
lifting up an entire community of 
people.
When FeelGood isn’t running 
delis, rushing off to make a delivery 
or dressing up in a giant, plush 
grilled cheese sandwich suit, they 
facilitate necessary conversations 
about world poverty with their 
members and across campus. They 
aim to de-stigmatize the issue by 
making it more well known while 
still conveying the full gravity 
of the situation. Every semester 
comes with a new fundraising 
goal as well as different areas of 
monetary allocation.
“It could mean allowing two 
elected women representatives in 
India to be trained and supported 
throughout the course of their 
five year term, or 23 biodigesters 
installed in rural villages in Nepal. 
It could mean 2.5 years of training 
on water resource management for 
a one-hand pump in Malawi or 120 
safe birthing kits,” Demeter said, 
speaking on FeelGood’s goal for 
the fall.
World poverty is understandably 
grim, but FeelGood tries to tackle 
the 
problem 
with 
optimism 
instead.
“When you hand someone a 
grilled cheese sandwich, they just 
smile,” DeBaun said. That smile is 
exactly what FeelGood is aiming 
for.

and exploring the wit between his 
own feelings in whatever form, 
image or taboo they may naturally 
assume. Furthermore, he pays 
direct homage to Bataille in his 
work: Barnes opens “The Past is a 
Grotesque Animal, ” the intense, 
ever-building 12-minute volta of 
his most critically acclaimed album 
to date, Hissing Fauna, Are You the 
Destroyer?, with the statement-
confession that, “I fell in love with 

the first cute girl that I met / Who 
could appreciate Georges Bataille 
/ Standing at a Swedish festival / 
Discussing ‘Story of the Eye’.”
Skeletal Lamping, the album 
that Nick would pair with “Story 
of the Eye,” is Barnes’s self-
proclaimed project to “bring all 
(his) 
puzzling, 
contradicting, 
humorous … fantasies, ruminations 
and observations to the surface” 
in an effect that comes off as 

quintessentially 
Bataille. 
In 
particular, the bouncing disco 
“Gallery 
Piece” 
achieves 
that 
poetically overwhelming volley of 
scandals, shooting off triplet after 
triplet of schizophrenic, verb-
based desires: “I wanna make you 
scream / I wanna braid your hair 
/ I wanna kiss your friends.” It’s 
churning, obsessive, funky and 
infectious; in fact, one might call it 
incandescent.

Feel good food for the feels

If you’re anything like me, 
when you get the feels, you 
get all the feels. One night, 
feels and all, you find yourself 
spoon-deep in a Ben & Jerry’s 
Cherry Garcia pint, running 
dangerously low on fuel. With 
a Calc 3 exam tomorrow and 
no episodes of “Shameless” 
left to watch, these are murky 
waters. You rush to the fridge 
in search of one more thing to 
take the pain away, but you’re 
met with nothing. Just a fridge 
as empty as a your wallet, your 
hopes and, now, your dreams. 
But, don’t let the panic sink 
in just yet — Trader Joe’s has 
everything you need to stave 
off all the feels this fall.
There’s 
something 
inexplicably satisfying about 
walking into Trader Joe’s and 
being blanketed by the warmly 
tinted lights and aisle after 
aisle of pleasantly packaged 
products. And with fall just 
over the horizon you can 
count on pumpkin flavored 
everything to be filling up the 
shelves.
But sifting through all that 
Trader Joe’s glory can be 
difficult, so here’s a little guide 
to take the edge off:
If your S.O. has run off 
(no horse, no other lover — 
they’re just running in the 
opposite direction, leaving 
you in the dust with a black 
hole in your chest) you 
should eat: Brownie Crisp 
coffee ice cream sandwiches
Don’t even stop to think 
about 
texting 
them 
back, 
they’re long gone now. It’s 
just you and a box of the most 
pleasure-filled 
desserts 
in 
existence. Biting into these, 

you won’t even have time to 
ponder what your long-gone-
lover is up to. Fudgy brownie 
crisp outside and espresso 
ground ice cream: a dreamy 
flavored medley you need. 
It’s the most Penelope Cruz 
(“Vicky Cristina Barcelona”) 
ice cream sandwich on the 
market — filled with spite, 
allure 
and 
straight-up 
seduction. I now pronounce 
you two a match made in 
heaven. If there’s anything you 
need to melt the break up feels 
away, this is it.
If 
you’re 
listening 
to 
Mitski’s latest album, Be the 
Cowboy, while sitting in a 
puddle of bittersweet, sappy 
tears, you should drink:
You should just drink. It 
doesn’t even matter what. Just 
drink.
Just kidding — if you want 
something to truly feel good, 
Trader Joe’s has a cinnamony, 
fall-fantastic Spiced Cider you 
can chug, or mix in with some 
rum for an extra punch in the 
face of feeling. Serve it hot or 
cold, just like your marble bag 
of emotions.
But if Spiced Cider isn’t 
enough to endure the heartfelt 
chords Mitski strikes in the 
build up to “Nobody,” then 
try La Ferme Julien Rosé. 
Imported from France, because 
who doesn’t love sipping on 
a nice glass of French wine 
pretending that you’re walking 
down les rues de Paris while 
Mitski softly serenades you 
through earbuds. Maybe with 
an “Old Friend,” or just on 
your own, thinking about a 
“Lonesome Love,” TJ’s has 
the specialty drinks that will 
make your “Washing Machine 
Heart” sing from delight. At 
least until your glass runs 
empty.
If the weight of your past 

drunken texts, failed exams 
and arguments with your 
mom are flashing before 
your eyes, you should eat: 
Pumpkin Joe-Joe’s
Yep. 
Only 
Trader 
Joe’s 
comes up with a food name 
that isn’t clever at all but 
somehow sounds quirky and 
cute because it has the name 
“Joe” in it two times. Pumpkin 
Joe-Joe’s take your average 
trendy pumpkin spice oreos 
one step further into Bougie 
City, with pumpkin flavored 
cookies and pumpkin flavored 
cream. There’s really no other 
reason to eat Pumpkin Joe-
Joe’s if you’re having afflictive 
mental flashbacks besides the 
fact that they taste great and 
are fall flavored.
If you’re laying in a field of 
grass, the stars in the night 
sky and all their grandeur 
unraveling profound depths 
of existential thought within 
you, you should eat: Harvest 
Spice Trek Mix
Studies show nuts are filled 
with Omega-3 and Vitamin E, 
making them the perfect brain 
power snack. Grab a copy of 
Nietzsche’s or Kant’s most 
renowned 
works, 
discover 
what dark matter consists of, 
become the last airbender. We 
need to keep this thought train 
chugging down its track. 
If you just feel hungry, 
you should eat: T&J’s Hatch 
Chile Mac & Cheese
Mac & cheese. Enough said.
If you’re allergic to nuts: 
No saving the earth kingdom 
for you, I guess.
Now you’re equipped with 
a grab ‘n go list for all the 
feel good foods from Trader 
Joe’s you’ll be needing this 
fall. So put on your favorite 
compulsively 
oversized 
sweater and get on in there. It’s 
about damn time you feel good.

The greatest social currency in 
my life circa 2011 was the amount 
of likes and comments I got on 
my Facebook profile. Looking 
back on it now, social media of the 
early 2010s is sort of a prehistoric 
wasteland, but to my tween self, 
it was fertile terrain rife with 
possibility. My first post was an 
unmistakable splash, more striking 
than a David Hockney canvas.
“If you think I’m cute, like my 
status.” It got six likes. I rode that 
high for just as many days.
I had established a clear brand 
with hits such as “English. Boring.” 
and an automated announcement 
that my new occupation was 
“Pokémon Master” at “Kanto 
Region.” This was a time when 
people would take the sans serif 
inquiry of “What’s on your mind?” 
at the top of their feeds to heart, 
but there was an unspoken social 
contract that one’s thoughts had to 
be sublimely curated to entertain 
the masses. For personal and 
unchecked raw emotion to seep 
into one’s status updates was a 
character assassination. And when 
I first downloaded Spotify, an 
attempt on my life was made.
This article has no concern 
with establishing primacy in the 
great music streaming service war, 
because I only want to establish 
for context I was a relatively early 
adopter of Spotify (and have a 
starred playlist dating back to 2012 
to prove it). Back in those naïve 
years, when the three curves on 
the Spotify logo were still white, 
the app had a sneaky feature where 
it could publish your listening 
activity to your Facebook profile 
in a rash of pathogenic posts. Like 
most embarrassing things, I was 
notified of it through the teasing 
of my friends who reported to me 
that their feed was plagued with 
undying notifications all prefixed 
by “Robert Mansuetti listened to.”

I ran to the family computer 
when I got home, typed my troubles 
into Google with the fastest fingers 
in the west and triple checked that 
the “feature” had been turned off. 
I pleaded to the most convenient 
higher power that my mom had 
not been online recently enough to 
prompt a conversation about how 
I’ve been “rotting my brain” with 
2Pac, J. Cole and other explicit 
rappers.
However, I discovered a terrible 
tool that day. Two deadly words: 
“Private session.” It was a foolproof 
way 
to 
prevent 
any 
further 
ridicule for my musical tastes 
from my peers. Little did I know 
that clicking the off button was 
tantamount to curling the index 
finger of a monkey’s paw.
My Spotify history has mostly 
remained private since then. The 
rare occasions when I went public 
were in service of haughty masters; 
I wanted to flex on my friends 
my 
superior 
(i.e. 
superficial) 
knowledge of classic rock or the 
golden age of hip hop. For a brief 
time I was a card-carrying member 
of “the wrong generation,” a period 
of my young idiocy I look back on 
with shame. Ironic, because shame 
was what I was trying to hide when 
I switched out of a private session.
I was afraid people would 
think I’m lame for listening to 
the Jupiter movement of Holst’s 
“The Planets” or songs off the 
“Les Mis” soundtrack. I was 
afraid people would think I’m 
queer for listening to the likes of 
Lady Gaga or Katy Perry or any 
other “girly” popstar. I was afraid 
people would think I have no 
taste if I listened to “Pumped Up 
Kicks” or “Somebody That I Used 
to Know” non-ironically after 
trashing its popularity at school. 
I had slowly built up a reputation 
as a knowledgeable source of 
music recommendations for my 
peers, one who went against the 
popular status quo of 14-year-olds 
and thought he could blow your 
world right open. The last thing my 

anxious self wanted was for that 
cool part of me to crumble.
The common thread that made 
me question my fears was that they 
were focused on how I perceived 
other people’s opinions of me. I 
asked myself, “Besides the middle 
school teasing, has anyone ever 
negatively commented on my 
choice of music?” The answer was 
a simple no. Plus, the fact that the 
number of connected friends I 
have on Spotify is comparatively 
lower than my count of Facebook 
friends and that most everyone 
listens to music on their phone 
nowadays and can’t even see their 
friends’ history was enough for me 
to make my Spotify history public, 
from now until the heat death of 
the universe.
The private session is a paradox. 
Many people swear by it and equate 
accidentally forgetting to click 
the option to social suicide. Yet in 
hiding behind this digital wall, the 
enriching social aspect of music — 
sharing recommendations, geeking 
out over your faves, finding new 
common ground with new friends 
— is completely obliterated.
Many a time I’ve accidently 
stumbled upon great music by 
simply clicking on the various 
songs my friends were listening to. 
If I love you as a person, what’s to 
say I won’t love your favorite music? 
Although my musical perception of 
the world was quite myopic in my 
early teenage years, it was slowly 
expanded by sharing it with others. 
It’s criminal to not to pay attention 
to the suggestions of others and 
only listen to the same handful of 
artists for the rest of your lifetime.
So, if you’re up to it, make a 
vow to only break out the private 
session in case of emergencies. 
Sure, people may see you’ve been 
listening to “Still Into You” for the 
past 15 minutes, but c’mon: In 2018, 
everyone likes Paramore. Instead 
of both listening to After Laughter 
ashamedly in the confines of our 
bedroom and our headphones, let’s 
dance to it together.

How I stopped worrying & 
loved my Spotify history

PERSONAL NOTEBOOK

Ann Arbor & the terrific, 
feel good, very great day

It’s mid-Oct. in Ann Arbor, a 
crisp Saturday morning in the fall. 
Instead of waking up to tailgate 
music 
pounding 
outside 
your 
window, it’s the soft autumnal 
glow through your shades and the 
rustling of a strong wind through 
dry leaves that brings you out of 
your sleep.
It’s 10:00 a.m. and you climb out 
of bed, feeling physically worn but 
mentally rested from the activities 
of Friday night. In your phone are 
texts and photos from your friends 
— stories, jokes and moments 
captured from another late night 
out.
You throw on your softest top, 
the one you may have spent too 
much money on, but you swear is 
worth every cent. Stepping outside, 
you head down State St. You pass 
your old dorm, where you met your 
best friend for the first time in a 
tipsy bathroom stupor. You pass 
a family of three taking pictures 
on the grass. You wonder if the 
bouncing toddler with them will 
find as much love here as you have.
As you turn the corner onto E. 
Liberty, you see the mural you’ve 

seen a thousand times over. You 
muse on whether you’ll ever figure 
out who each person is. It has been 
two years and at this point, you’re 
too afraid to ask. Or maybe you just 
like the mystery.
Walking further and further 
down 
Liberty, 
the 
bustle 
of 
backpack-clad 
20-year-olds 
and athletes on mopeds fades to 
30-somethings with dogs and 
elderly couples linking elbows. 
They smile at you, nod their heads, 
remembering the times when they 
were that young. You keep walking.
As you hit Main St., Ann Arbor 
comes alive. You smell cherries, 
candles, old books, the unwavering, 
underlying scent of freshly-cooked 
breakfast food. As you turn the 
corner you stop into your favorite 
book store. Alongside the scent of 
espresso and ink, you discover new 
books, new ideas, new journeys to 
embark on. A young woman sits 
on a bench twiddling her glasses 
and flipping through a book about 
France. You hope she makes it 
there. You exit the store.
You continue to walk as the sun 
breaks through the morning fog. 
You close your eyes as it hits your 
face, its warmth washing over 
you like a sip of hot tea. As you go, 
the smells and sights of Main St. 

dwindle. Coffee and lamp posts are 
replaced with apple cider and brick 
roads.
You walk into the Farmer’s 
Market and feel as though you’ve 
walked into a field ripe with 
harvest. A toddler reaches out for a 
sugar-coated donut. His dad turns 
him away, but the vendor smiles 
and sneaks him a piece. Your walk 
down the aisle is a mirage of color, 
a new shade hitting your eyes as 
you go table to table. You stop at a 
woman who reminds you of your 
grandmother. She hands you warm 
cider and a sense of comfort. You 
continue.
On your way back home you 
don’t notice what’s going on around 
you. An old dog plays fetch with his 
young owner. Neighbors greet each 
other at the grocery store. A second 
date starts off at brunch. You keep 
going.
That night you’re resting on your 
couch. There is a knock at the door 
and your friends tumble in before 
you can even stand up. They’re 
chattering and laughing and in the 
middle of a trifling fight that started 
on the way over. Wine is poured, 
games are played and memories 
are recounted. You’ve heard these 
stories a million times before. You 
don’t care. You’re happy.

COLUMBIA RECORDS
Playing alongside John 
Mayer, night after night

Two pops start the evening 
session: One comes from my 
guitar’s connection with its 
amplifier, the other from the 
record player’s needle settling 
onto the vinyl. The record 
starts spinning with its silent 
preamble while I tune my guitar 
and adjust the volume. John 
Mayer’s guitar sounds, and all 
is well. Its classic tone wades 
through the speakers to make 
it to my ears. Mayer’s guitar 
has been heard by millions, but 
when I play his records, it’s just 
the two of us.
Like most ’90s babies, I 
had heard John Mayer’s hits 
through childhood: “Your Body 
Is a Wonderland,” “Waiting on 
the World to Change” and so 
on. It wasn’t until the summer 
before coming to the University 
that I really started to connect 
with Mayer himself.
Mayer’s 
2006 
album, 
Continuum, 
resonated 
with 
me 
that 
summer. 
I 
found 
myself listening to the album 
all the way through, several 
times 
a 
day. 
Continuum 
included Mayer’s own lyrical 
masterpieces in addition to a 

cover of Jimi Hendrix’s “Bold as 
Love.” I loved each song on the 
record and ended up buying it 
on vinyl to add to my collection.
Continuum led me to retrieve 
the dusty acoustic guitar from 
the basement and teach myself 
how to play guitar — that was 
one of the greatest decisions of 
my life.
That grew into a passion for 
the instrument and a greater 
love for the blues. I invested 
in a used Fender to try to use 
the electric guitar for voicing, 
like I heard John Mayer do. 
All because of my love for 
Continuum.
I was playing guitar every 
morning and every night.
I found myself returning 
to Continuum as I started to 
drown in my first semester at 
the University. I tried teaching 
myself a few of the songs on the 
record, but it was more difficult 
than I thought it would be. I 
didn’t know how to play each 
song note for note, but I could 
find the particular song’s key 
and play my own rendition 
as the record was playing. I 
had discovered for myself an 
entirely new way to experience 
music.
The G chord that introduces 
“Gravity” sounded the same 

as the G chord on my guitar. 
I could mirror the melody of 
“Slow Dancing in a Burning 
Room” in conversation with 
Mayer through my Fender. I 
could echo the somber notes of 
“Stop This Train.” The two of us 
could speak the same language.
The more that I listened to 
and accompanied the album, the 
more that I felt as though Mayer 
and I were on the same page. 
We were both struggling with 
anxiety, regret and uncertainty 
about the future. We were 
communicating 
through 
the 
blues scale.
In a way, John Mayer was my 
therapist; my guitar could voice 
what my vocal cords couldn’t 
muster.
Every now and then, I will 
return to Continuum to calm 
my anxieties, even if it is only 
to remind myself that the first 
strums on “Stop This Train” 
still sound that way.
After my fingers tire and 
several 
records 
have 
been 
flipped, I call it a night. Mayer 
and I might have talked for 
hours, or just a few minutes. 
Expressing myself with John 
Mayer, someone who shares my 
love for blues guitar and over-
analysis, clears my head and 
calms my nerves.

ZACHARY WAARALA
For the Daily

I love to be alone.
Headphones 
in. 
Blankets 
tucked up to my chin. Air 
conditioning on high. A book 
in my hands, with a spine 
that cracks. A vanilla-scented 
candle, or pumpkin (if it’s 
Oct.), burning on my bedside 
table. Maybe listening to Vance 
Joy. Drifting in and out of an 
uncommitted sleep. Just me 
and my thoughts. Just me and 
my words.
I like to go shopping alone. 
Browsing in and out of stores 
with nobody urging me to go 
from one place to another, to 
hurry up or slow down. Just on 
my very own time. Bookstores 
are the best for solo browsing. 
Maybe it’s just me, but I can’t 
have too many distractions if 
I happen upon a bookstore, 
unsure of what I’ll select as 
my next literary adventure. I 
need time in my own mind, to 
browse and mingle with the 
characters on the pages. I can 
only make a selection if all my 
attention is on the shelves in 
front of me.
I like to get coffee alone — 
watching the people cycle in 
and out of the cafe — on their 

phones, with a lover, on a first 
date. I jot down what I notice, 
and all I worry about is the ink 
of my pen, my almond milk 
cappuccino and this flaky, 
chocolate croissant. It is much 
easier to people watch alone. 
It’s much easier to write poetry 
alone. It’s much easier to make 
my cappuccino last for hours 
when there’s nobody there to 
tell me they’re bored of sitting 
and overhearing conversations 
about baby showers and car 
accidents and expensive trips 
to Whole Foods. 
This is what it means to me: 
to recharge.
I digress. I love to be around 
people — I thrive off of lovely 
conversation, a dining room 
table set for dinner with five 
chairs too many and long drives 
as the leaves change with 
my brother in the passenger 
seat, talking the whole way as 
the scenery molds and shifts. 
But having time for myself is 
essential in my day to day when 
I sometimes feel as though 
the walls of my own mind are 
caving in on me. It is a rarity to 
get more than a few moments 
of alone time each day. I never 
realized how much I took alone 
time for granted until I was 
thrust back into the routine of 
college life after my summer of 
solitude.

In St. Louis this past summer, 
I spent most of my time alone. I 
went on long, dragging, hot and 
procrastinating runs — going 
for as long as my legs would 
allow, just to kill the time. 
When I was let off work early 
I walked around Forest Park, 
as the Midwest heat beat down 
on my sunburned shoulders 
and sunburned cheeks and the 
sweat dripped from my hairline 
down my face. St. Louis is 
dangerously hot in July, but I 
learned to love the feeling of 
walking by myself in the heavy 
heat. I would walk through the 
free zoo, slowly, noticing and 
wondering. I would stare at 
the elephants and hang around 
the giraffe exhibit. I would 
smile at the little kids tugging 
on their mother’s shorts and 
squealing with delight. I’d 
wonder about when I was their 
age. I’d walk from the zoo to 
Jeni’s for ice cream, and I’d sit 
on the bench outside, all alone, 
and lick my butter cake ice 
cream cone that melted down 
my fingers and hands. I went 
on bike rides when I needed to 
clear my head, happened upon 
the art museum when I was 
bored and spent hours in the 
coffee shop at the intersection 
of Skinker and Forest Park 
Parkway, tucked in the corner 
that was always vacant.

ELI RALLO
Daily Arts Writer

I always ended up in the 
bookstore, on the floor, with 
my legs tucked under me, 
paging through the novels 
to 
decide 
what 
was 
next 
to read. The hours flew by 
in the bookstore, whereas 
they 
dragged 
whenever 
I 
was anywhere else. When 
I challenged myself to stop 
spending money on books, I’d 
venture downstairs and sort 
through the $1 used books, 
buying any collection of poems 
that had a nice title.
I learned to enjoy eating 
alone — dining in and eating 

out, 
tacos 
and 
breakfasts, 
hamburgers 
and 
oatmeal 
bowls 
and 
anything 
with 
bell peppers. I spent a good 
amount of time in the aisles 
of Trader Joe’s thinking of 
how I’d be able to master my 
next unexpected and original 
recipe. I always ate against the 
ceiling to floor windows in my 
kitchen, watching the sunset 
bleed through the peaks in the 
trees.
Even when the sun goes 
down on a St. Louis summer 
day, it’s still too hot.
But now, here in Ann Arbor, 

as the seasons change and 
my entire life seems to be an 
unfinished to-do list, I long 
for the heat, its lasting burn 
through the mindful, peaceful, 
quiet days. The way it felt on 
my shoulders and back as I 
strolled alone and unfettered 
through the lush green park 
— nowhere to go, nobody to 
answer to, not a deadline in 
site. Just me, my mind, the 
lone bench in the zoo near 
the giraffes and a Jeni’s ice 
cream cone waiting for me — 
promised to myself in the near 
future.

The Romcomaissance saw 
movies 
like 
2002’s 
“Sweet 
Home Alabama” and 2004’s 
“50 First Dates” — movies that 
never tried to be anything more 
than exactly what they were. 

That’s all romcoms are, really: 
At their barest bones, they’re 
movies that are made for their 
audiences. They’re algorithmic 
and predictable, and they’re not 
made for the people that won’t 
like them or won’t get them. 
These movies are good because 
of the feelings they monopolize, 
not because of their stellar plots 
or 
cinematography. 
They’re 
good because of The Look.
The Look doesn’t say, “I want 
to lunge at you,” and it doesn’t 
even say “I want to kiss you.” 
The Look says, “I think that 
if I were to never stop looking 
at you, I’d be OK.” It’s Heath 
Ledger staring at you as he asks 
if it’s quite alright that he loves 
you, baby. It’s Hugh Dancy in 
the firelight proving, once and 
for all, that consent is sexy. 
The Look is an exhale, when 
you finally get what you always 
knew you deserved.
Romcom ladies were always 
perfect to me — cutely clumsy, 
magnetically 
manic. 
And 
they’re still perfect to me, but as 
I’ve grown with them, they’ve 
shaped me in 
more ways than 
just 
making 
flared-jeans my 
forever 
go-to. 
When 
Hilary 
Duff tears into 
the locker room 
in “A Cinderella 
Story” 
to 
tell 
the 
most 
beautiful 
boy 
in school (see: 
the world) that 
waiting for him 
is “like waiting 
for rain in this drought,” she’s 
nervous 
and 
embarrassed. 
This is also the one moment in 
the movie that she holds her 
head the highest. She fills her 
life with all the love she’ll ever 
need, and she walks out of that 
locker room, one thumb hooked 
firmly in her belt loop, alone. 

She — like all the very best 
romcom gals — knew her worth.
In 2004’s “13 Going on 30” 
— possibly my favorite romcom 
ever — there’s this scene where 
Jennifer Garner’s character is 
telling a bunch of 13-year-old 
girls about love, and how it’s 
a battlefield. And then they 
danced. The movie is a romcom, 
yeah, but it’s about a girl 
breaking in her pink dream-
house, growing up, teaching 
her co-workers how to dance 
to “Thriller.” It’s one of the 
most 
profoundly 
romcom-y 
romantic comedies I’ve ever 
seen because, at its very core, 
the movie is hers. All of it. “13 
Going on 30” belongs to this girl 
who’s not quite sure who she is, 
giving her the space to hold the 
hands of other girls who aren’t 
quite sure who they are and 
talk about the night with the 
Razzles.
Romantic comedies are holy 
ground. I’m built from them, 
and I know they’ve built a lot 
of other people, too. I know I’m 
never going to dance to “Bennie 
and 
the 
Jets” 
on a bar table 
in the middle of 
nowhere 
after 
hydroplaning 
with 
James 
Marsden. 
But 
that doesn’t stop 
me from wanting 
to see Katherine 
Heigl do it. I’ve 
watched 
that 
scene at least 27 
times (sorry), and 
it gets me every 
damn one. There’s 
just this feeling of knowing 
that I’m always going to get 
the 
chest-clutching, 
knee-
curling, 
doubling-over-in-
glee kind of warmth that I’ve 
sustained myself on for a solid 
two decades now. These stories 
aren’t mine, but they are, and 
they always will be.

FILM NOTEBOOK

I’ve always been someone 
who tends to disregard whether 
or not a movie is considered 
high art or in particularly good 
taste. Last week, I watched 
“Penelope” again, even though 
it’s labeled as one of the “movies 
for ages 11 to 12” on Netflix. 
I love it regardless. I love 
the way Penelope (Christina 
Ricci, “Z: The Beginning of 
Everything”) weeds out her 
undeserving suitors and the 
way the final kiss makes me feel 
like I have sparklers sizzling 
through my chest. There’s a 
feeling so integral and inherent 
to movies like “Penelope” — 
movies that exist to make you 
feel something, anything, good. 

“Penelope” is a romcom.
Every time I start to think I’m 
a parody of myself, I remember 
two things:
One: I am.
Two: It doesn’t matter.
I don’t care that the line I’ve 
been holding in my heart for 
eight years now — “It makes me 
so sad that people like Kostas 
and Bridget who have lost 
everything can still be open 
to love, while I, who have lost 
nothing, am not” — came from 
a franchise founded upon a pair 
of blue jeans (“Sisterhood of the 
Traveling Pants”). I don’t care.
I love these movies with all 
that I am because they make me 
feel good. It feels good to watch 
two people want each other so 
much that they hate each other, 
even though they don’t hate 
each other — not even close, not 

even a little bit, not even at all.
And 
they’ve 
taught 
me 
things, you know? They’ve 
taught me how to stress-scrub 
my stove, and to speak up even 
when I feel like the smallest 
person in the room. They’ve 
taught me the power of a boot-
cut. They’ve taught me that I 
should never — not ever — settle 
for anyone or anything that 
doesn’t absolutely thrill me. 
We’ve all got glitter in our blood 
and love in our very bones.
There was a period in the 
mid ’90s-2000s (what I like 
to call The Romcomaissance) 
when romcoms did nothing 
short of thrive. 1999’s “She’s 
All That,” 2001’s “The Wedding 
Planner,” 2008’s “Definitely, 
Maybe” — they’re sweet in the 
easiest of ways. Laney Boggs 
deserved better and Mary Fiore 

WARNER BROS.
To all the romcoms I’ve loved before

VIDEO GAMES NOTEBOOK

ELECTRONIC ARTS

What do you get when you 
mix the board-game “Life,” 

“Cards Against Humanity” and 
an HGTV home improvement 
show? The EA (Electronic 
Arts) gaming masterpiece “The 
Sims 3.” Whether it’s becoming 
a home renovation guru and 
designing the kitchen of your 

dreams (granite countertops 
and all) or throwing morality 
out the window to live out 
your wildest fantasies (like 
doing-the-dirty with the grim 
reaper or — more morbidly — 
drowning your Sims in a pool), 
“The Sims 3” has a little bit 
of something for everyone.
The franchise’s motto, 
“Play with life,” perfectly 
encapsulates 
the 
very 
nature of the game: As you 
guide your character, or 
Sim, through their life, the 
opportunities 
(if 
grave-
robbing is an “opportunity”) 
are limitless, providing an 
individualized 
experience 
for each player. It’s up to 
you to make what you will 
of the game. But beyond 
the 
boundless 
creativity 
and anarchic freedom of 
the game, there lies a level 
of control afforded to the 
player that is not accessible 
in reality, making “The 
Sims 3” the perfect platform 
to channel high levels of 
stress and anxiety. After all, 
when life throws you into 
a metaphorical shredder, 
what’s a better way to 
regain a sense of control 
than by assuming the role of 
a virtual god in “The Sims 
3”?
For as long as I can 
remember, 
I’ve 
always 
struggled 
with 
high 
anxiety.

Creative chaos: How ‘The 
Sims 3’ helps with anxiety

I want for dinner, to crossing 
the street as the light flashes 
red, to having to say “no” to 
people (I’m a people-pleaser) 
can trigger a bout of gut-
wrenching anxiety. Growing 
up in New York City certainly 
didn’t help either. I’m almost 
always in a constant state of 
apprehension, so most of the 
time it’s simple enough to gulp 
down the characteristic wave 
of nausea and bite my nails to 
nubs in lieu of panic attack. 
But sometimes the anxiety 
proves too intense to clamp 
down. Cue the crushing weight 
on my chest that feels like the 
breath has been knocked out of 
me, the bile that bubbles up my 
throat, the burning, blinding 
tears. As a young girl, home 
alone in the midst of a panic 
attack and no one to come calm 
and me down, I had to find a 
way to help myself. So, I got 
creative. My answer? “The 
Sims 3.”
I can still remember blowing 
(literal) dust off my neglected 
iMac 2007, waiting what felt 
like eons to boot up the game, 
listening to the rumble of the 
fans struggling to keep the 
system from overheating. My 
monstrous 
desktop 
always 
seemed like the dinosaur of the 
digital age, big and clunky even 
when it was still new. More 
often than not, I would have to 
coax the computer to play nice, 
restarting that useless hunk of 
junk and crossing my fingers 
that the oh-so-familiar green 
diamond would pop up on 
screen — usually accompanied 
by a full-volume blast of “The 
Sims 3”’s opening theme song.
Playing 
the 
game, 
I 
would 
— 
and 
occasionally 
still do — spend hours with 
the 
customization 
tools. 
Sometimes I would simply 
recreate familiar figures — 
friends, family, pop culture 
icons — and other times I 
would let my imagination run 
wild, like when I made my 
green, kleptomaniac vampire 
named Steve. The Create-A-
Sim, or the character design, 
function of the game allows 
the player to customize nearly 
every aspect of their Sim, from 
their voices to their clothing 
and even their personality 
traits. The level of character 
detail allowed me to lose 
myself in the game, helping me 
take my mind off my anxiety. 
The ability to build and design 
homes, or lots, in the game 
is also an activity I relished 

in. Not only could I express 
my own artistic ability, but 
wasting away the afternoon 
doing something as simple as 
designing the pattern of the 
drapes in my Sim’s home was 
downright relaxing. “The Sims 
3” has a unique mind-numbing 
effect; unlike other games, I 
don’t need to think in order 
to play, and most of the time 
overthinking is my big, fat 
problem.

Not only does “The Sims 
3” simulate a deep level of 
relaxation, but playing the 
game also allows me to feel 
like I’m in control. Panic 
attacks and regular bouts of 
anxiety are self-perpetuating 
problems: They are inspired 
by a perceived lack of control, 
followed by the subsequent 
emotional 
rollercoaster 
so 
debilitating that you then lose 
what little control you might 
have had — a vicious cycle.
However, in “The Sims 3,” 
 
the player has control over 
almost every aspect of the 
game — I have control over the 
entire in-game world. I can stop 
time or speed it up within the 
game, control every action of 
my Sim, influence the weather 
and the lives of other computer 
generated 
and 
controlled 
characters and even age or 
make immortal any character. 
I can use cheats or game-
mods to surpass what few 
in-game boundaries there are. 
Now, I can admit that this can 
come off as a little bit power-
hungry and controlling. But 
in all honesty, that’s because 
I am — that’s what my anxiety 
drives me to be. Sure, I would 
love to prop my feet up, grab 
a drink with a fancy umbrella 

in it and watch a YouTube 
video of a beach in Fiji while 
deadlines, responsibilities and 
my problems sail overhead. But 
my personal reality is that I’m 
doomed to suffer through life 
as a ball of perpetual stress. So 
I do what I can and indulge in 
what I’m able to afford in order 
to stay afloat.
“The Sims 3” not only acts as 
a safe, reliable medium for me 
to channel my anxiety, but the 
game also simulates the control 
and security I need and desire 
to contend with my anxiety. 
From my own experience, 
using something so simple — 
some would say childish — as 
a video game has prompted me 
to reevaluate how video games 
are marketed to audiences, 
and for what purpose they’re 
produced. A game like “The 
Sims 3” is meant to provide 
entertainment 
— 
I 
highly 
doubt any of the developers 
considered the game as a 
possible form of therapy for 
players 
with 
high 
anxiety 
when they initially created 
the game. But what if the 
experiences video games are 
intended to simulate didn’t 
simply imitate life or distract 
from it, but rather help the 
players process and contend 
with their own lives?
So often video games are 
written off as being unhealthy, 
addictive, pointless, childish 
— 
and 
some 
games 
are 
justly described as such. But 
that doesn’t have to be the 
reputation of the industry. 
Recently, 
arguments 
have 
been made for the role video 
games could play in education, 
bringing subjects like history 
to life with virtual reality or 
in-game educational lessons or 
activities. So why can’t video 
games be developed and used to 
help people of all ages (gamers 
or not) process and deal with 
mental and emotional issues? 
In an age when technology is 
being integrated into nearly 
every aspect of our lives, it’s 
only logical to think that 
mental and emotional health 
and digital innovation may one 
day intersect.
So, the next time you feel 
like the world is crashing down 
around you, try taking a page 
from my book: Take a breath, 
take a break and maybe boot-
up a decade-old 2007 iMac and 
go build some “Fixer Upper”-
worthy kitchens that HGTV’s 
Chip and Joanna Gaines would 
be proud of.

Not only does 
“The Sims 3” 
simulate a deep 
level of relaxation, 
but playing the 
game also allows 
me to feel like I’m 
in control

I love these 
movies with all 
that I am because 
they make me feel 
good
