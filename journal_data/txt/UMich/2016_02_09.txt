Researchers find 
use of the drug 

negatively impacts 
verbal recollection

By MADELINE GERSON

For the Daily

According to a recent study 

by Deborah Levine, an assistant 
professor at the University of 
Michigan Medical School, long-
term marijuana use is associated 
with poor verbal memory in 
middle age.

Levine, who is an investigator 

of risk development in coronary 
arteries for young adults, practices 
at both the University Hospital 
and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare 
System.

Levine, along with Reto Auer, 

a researcher at the University of 
Lausanne, Switzerland, compiled 
data from a 25-year CARDIA 
study, which analyzed cognitive 
performance by observing and 
calculating the verbal memory, 
executive function and processing 

speed of participants.

According to Levine, there 

seemed to only be a correlation 
between marijuana usage and 
verbal memory, with no evidence 
of an effect on processing speed or 
executive function.

However, Levine emphasised 

that correlation is not equivalent 
to causation.

“Our results found a significant 

association between long-term 
marijuana use in early adulthood 
and 
decreased 
cognitive 

functioning at midlife,” Levine 
said. 
“However, 
our 
results 

demonstrate an association and 
do not prove causality.”

With 
large 
numbers 
of 

adolescent 
and 
young-adult 

marijuana users and an ongoing 
movement to decriminalize and 
legalize marijuana, Levine said 
the issue of the health effects 
of marijuana is relevant. States 
have legalized marijuana, and 
many cities including Ann Arbor 
have decriminalized its meaning. 
According to the 2013 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health,

Thomas Perez said 
businesses benefit 
when they increase 
benefits for workers

U.S. 
Secretary 
of 
Labor 

Thomas Perez discussed ways for 
businesses and the government to 

create a more prosperous national 
economy at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Monday evening.

Appointed by President Barack 

Obama, Perez has served as 
labor secretary since 2013 on 
Monday. Perez said the Obama 
administration has helped create a 
shared economic prosperity for all 
by encouraging businesses to make 
conscious decisions to benefit their 
workers.

Discussing national economic 

progress 
during 
the 
Obama 

administration, Perez noted that 
the unemployment rate is now at 
4.9 percent and that the number 
of jobs has grown by 14 million, 
according to the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.

Perez said this growth is in 

part due to businesses’ starting to 
realize how adequately providing 
for their workers, pleasing their 
shareholders and taking care of 
their customers are not trade-
offs — successful businesses do all 
three, and gain revenue by treating 

their workers well.

“Businesses are seeing that 

investing in their workers is one 
of the best ways to grow the 
bottom line,” Perez said. “They’re 
embracing 
what 
Henry 
Ford 

embraced when he doubled the 
wages of people on the assembly 
line, understanding that better 
paid workers are more productive 
workers.”

Perez said businesses should not 

view raising wages and increasing

Officials say 

Flintwater.com 
has illegally used 
government logos

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan Attorney General 

Bill Schuette issued a warning 
to Flintwater.com, a website 
advertised as a charity raising 
money to aid the Flint water 
crisis, for potential charitable 
solicitation 
violations 
on 

Thursday.

The 
website 
was 
using 

logos 
from 
United 
Way, 

Pure 
Michigan, 
Flint 

Water Response Team and 
the 
American 
Red 
Cross 

without permission from the 
organizations or notification 
of their use, according to 
Schuette’s office. 

Earlier last week, Schuette 

issued a consumer alert to 
the public warning them to be 
vigilant for potential charity 
scams in relation to Flint. He 
urged people to be cautious of 
websites asking for personal 
information and checks to 
make sure the organization is 
listed on the attorney general’s 
website as a registered charity.

Andrea 
Bitely, 

communications 
director 

at 
the 
Michigan 
attorney 

general’s office, said both state 
Sen. Jim Ananich (D-Flint) 
and 
United 
Way, 
a 
local 

charity, alerted the office of 

the potential scam.

“Jim 
Ananich 
and 
the 

United Way both called our 
office and let us know what 
was going on,” she said. “We 
sent them a cease and desist. 
They can’t have those up.”

Pam Smith, president of 

United Way of Washtenaw 
County, said the organization 
does everything it can to 
prevent such scams, but often 
has to rely on individuals 
informing 
it 
of 
potential 

violations.

“We do the very best we can 

to protect our brand,” she said. 
“Anybody can grab a logo shot 
off the Internet, so we rely 
on our donors, our volunteers 
and the general public to let us 
know.”

Smith said after learning 

about the misuse of their logo, 
the organization took the 
necessary steps immediately 
to have it removed.

“Once we were made aware 

of that, we immediately filed 
a cease and desist order,” she 
said. “The logo was taken 
down the same day.”

According to Bitely, the 

Michigan attorney general’s 
office said their responses to 
potential scams depend on the 
nature of the issue.

“If it’s similar we will do 

another cease and desist. If 
it’s a door-to-door scam we 
encourage the public to call 
law enforcement,” she said 
referring to Flintwater.com

Marv Fox, personal trainer, basketball coach, and inspirational speaker, discusses the path to achieving personal 
success at the 2nd Annual William Monroe Trotter Lecture in the Michigan Union on Monday. 

Presenters at 
the event urge 

attendees to pursue 

personal success

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Speakers 
challenged 

University 
students 
and 

faculty to succeed Monday 
night during the second annual 
William 
Monroe 
Trotter 

lecture at the Michigan Union.

The annual lecture was 

created as an opportunity for 

Trotter to engage the public 
with its works and also for 
students and faculty to hear 
the 
stories 
of 
University 

community members who have 
been affected by racial inequity 
or have overcome obstacles.

This 
year, 
the 
lecture 

featured remarks from Sean 
Pitt, an LSA junior and Central 
Student 
Government 
chief 

of staff, Public Policy junior 
Hattie McKinney, vice speaker 
for the Black Student Union 
and motivational speaker Marv 
Fox Jr.

Pitt 
emphasized 
the 

importance of speaking up on 
the University’s campus.

“Your voice matters just as 

much in a leadership role as it 
does when you meet a friend 
for coffee,” Pitt said. “Or make 
any other decision that reflects 
your values and your truth.”

McKinney 
provided 

historical 
background 
on 

William Trotter, for whom 
the 
Trotter 
Multicultural 

Center was named, relating the 
history of Trotter to students’ 
ability to gain and exhibit self 
confidence. Trotter, an activist 
for racial equality, experienced 
segregation in the early 1900s 
and worked to combat Klu 
Klux Klan propaganda.

“Knowing who you are is 

essential,” 
McKinney 
said.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
joined 
the 
Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs’ 
meeting 

Monday to talk about his goal to 
increase collaboration among the 
19 schools and colleges within 
the University.

“The 
current 
system 
and 

model of the traditional and 
decentralized 
leadership 
by 

means of separate schools has 
driven the schools to individual 
excellence,” Schlissel said. “We 
have left one more layer on top 
that we’ve really tried to tap 
into and that is the strategic 
collaboration 
between 
our 

schools.”

Schlissel also said he hopes 

collaboriting 
on 
issues 
will 

excite not only those inside 
the University, but the larger 
community as well.

“I value scholarship where 

it’s scholars talking to other 
scholars, 
because 
long-term 

insight comes out of that,” he 
said. “I also value scholarship 
that produces things that the 
public can understand and can 
really emotionally engage with.”

this 
public 

engagement reinforces the value 
of the University and informs 
others of what goes on at the

HATS OFF

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
is 

introducing a new rotating item, 
Tents and Tables, that seeks to 
highlight campus activities on 
the Diag and near the posting 
wall in Angell Hall. 

The 
College 
Democrats 

were particularly active with 
the upcoming primary election 
happening March 8. Because 
today was the last day for filing 
absentee ballots, club members 
took 
shifts 
throughout 
the 

day to encourage out-of-state 
students to register to vote.

In an interview, LSA junior 

Brendan Schroder highlighted 
some 
of 
the 
organization’s 

upcoming events, which include 
a sex education event.

“Every Thursday at 8 we 

have an event called KickAss, 
which is where we all get 
together,” he said. “This week 
is a great one because it’s Sex-
Ed KickAss hosted by the Fem 
Dems, which is our women’s 
rights committee.”

Epsilon Nu Tau — a chapter 

of the first entrepreneurship 
fraternity in the United States 
— also tabled in Angell Hall 
to 
promote 
an 
upcoming 

event featuring a hypnotist 
entertainer.

The 
chapter’s 
founder, 

Business senior Alex Weiss, 
helped run the table for part 
of the day. He said the event 
will be the first hosted by the 
fraternity.

“For the first time in our 

history, we’re doing a huge 
campus-wide event,” he said. 
“It’s happening this Friday 
in the Michigan Union in the 
Rogel Ballroom. We’re bringing 
in 
a 
professional 
hypnotist 

entertainer. He’s coming from 
Canada. He’s an alum of the 
University. He’s going to be 
putting on a great show for the 
students. So we’re selling tickets 
to that. It’s going to be a lot of 
fun for anyone who attends.”

He said a goal of the 

organization is to help inspire 
young professionals.

“We help teach young people 

— college students — about 
entrepreneurial principles, help 
them instill an entrepreneurial 
spirit,” he said. “We have a lot of 
fun doing it. We do socials like a 
normal fraternity but we try to 
put an entrepreneurial spin on 
everything we do.”

The University’s chapter of 

Timmy Global Health was also 
stationed in Angell Hall, also 
advertising upcoming activities 
within 
their 
organization. 

According to itswebsite, the 
organization aims to increase 
access 
to 
health 
care 
and 

allow students and volunteers 
to 
address 
global 
health 

challenges.

LSA 
freshman 
Alaina 

Horwood said throughout the 
year, the club holds events on 
campus including a Glow Run, 
a Global Health Symposium 
and benefit dinners in order 
to raise money to send to Mao, 
Dominican Republic.

‘U’ researchers 

explore ways doctors 

can assign lower 

doses of strong drugs 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Giving patients smaller doses 

of prescription opioid painkillers 
may prevent overdoses, according 
to a recent University study.

Opioids, medications often used 

to treat acute pain from surgeries 
and cancer, have also increasingly 
been used in more recent years for 
chronic pain management.

Amy Bohnert, lead author of 

the study and assistant professor 
of psychiatry, said the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s 
guidelines for prescription opioid 
medication have recently begun 
to suggest lower thresholds than 
they have in the past. The current 
guidelines from the CDC have not 
recommended not going above 90 

morphine-equivalent milligrams, 
also called MEM, and encourage 
health care providers to be caution 
once a patient begins to receive or 
go above 50 MEM, according to 
Bohnert.

Additionally, the study found 

the average doses of prescription 
opioids were much higher for 
those who died of an overdose as 
compared to those who survived.

“We found that there was a 

substantial portion of the people 
who died in an opioid overdose,” 
Bohnert said. “Assuming that the 
fact that they were given such 
large quantities influenced the 
fact that they overdosed, had 
their treatment pattern been 
different, had they gotten a lower 
dosage, it could have prevented 
their death.”

Bohnert 
said 
the 
study 

stemmed from the results of 
an original study she worked 
on five years ago. In that study, 
Bohnert said the researchers 
looked at the amount of opioids 
prescribed to specific patients 
and how that related to their 

risk of overdosing on those 
medications. Bohnert said they 
found the greater the amount 
a patient was prescribed, the 
greater their risk of overdose.

The study used date from the 

the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor 
Healthcare System is a national 
leader when it comes to having the 
type of medical records necessary 
for this research, and is why she 
decided to complete her research 
using their resources. The VA is 
also working with the CDC to 
have a complete match on cause-
specific mortality data.

“We found that the rate of 

unintentional overdose, by any 
substance, not just prescription 
opioids, is twice as high in VA 
patients than it is in the general 
population, after you account for 
differences in age and sex.”

According to the CDC, the rate 

of deaths from drug overdoses, 
specifically overdoses involving 
opioids, has increased 200 percent 
since 2000. 

Each day, 46 people die from 

an overdose of prescription opioid 

or narcotic painkillers in the 
United States, the CDC also 
reported. In 2012, reportedly 
259 million prescriptions for 
painkillers were written by 
health care providers, equaling 
enough for every American 
adult to have a bottle of the 

medication.

Bohnert said the findings that 

there have been more prescription 
opioid overdoses recently than in 
previous years has resulted from 
changes in the way prescription 
opioid medication has been used, 
as the medication is now applied 
to both acute and chronic pain.

In the study, the researchers 

changed 
the 
design 
from 

the 
original 
study 
Beohnert 

conducted five years ago, she 
said. Rather than taking an 
entire population of patients 
who were prescribed opioids, 
she said the researchers looked 
at patients who were identified 
as having died of a prescription 
opioid overdose, and were being 
prescribed opioids at the time 
that they died.

The researchers then created 

a 
comparison 
group, 
whose 

members were matched to patients 
in the original study basedon 
criteria such as demographics, 
clinical 
characteristics 
and 

treatment characteristics.

“What you’re prescribed as 

a patient should be tailored to 
what your needs are and the 
way in which you are unique, so 
hopefully by matching like we 
did, we’re making a much more 
accurate comparison,” Bohnert 
said. “By doing that, we still 
found that there were substantial 

differences between people in 
terms of opioid doses, between 
people who died of an overdose 
and their matched comparison 
group.”

While the average dose for 

people who died of an overdose 
was almost 100 MEM, in the 
comparison group with patients 
who did not die of an overdose, the 
average dose prescribed was less 
than 50 MEM.

Bohnert said there is additional 

preview data supporting the idea 
that if a patient is prescribed a 
higher dose of a prescription opioid 
medication, they are more likely 
to develop problems with the 
substance, which could lead to risky 
patterns of behavior associated 
with the substance that could lead 
to overdose, Bohnert said.

Additionally, because patients 

often develop tolerance when 
they use opioids, they have to 
use more of the medication 
to 
feel 
the 
same 
effects. 

As a patient gets to higher 
doses, they can also develop 
tolerance to the medication’s 
respiratory depression effects, 
she noted, a patient has to use 
more medication to cause an 
overdose, and maybe prescribed 
higher doses. As a result of their 
growing tolerance, they are 
more likely to have received 
more medication. 

With more on hand, it is much 

easier to overdose, Bohnert said.

“The solution to this is going 

to require a lot of different 
interventions,” Bohnert said. “One 
of them is that prescribers are 
becoming increasingly cautious 
about escalating doses to higher 
levels.”

However, Bohnert said that does 

not address how to help patients 
who are already on high doses and 
exhibiting signs showing they are 
at risk for adverse outcomes with 
the medications.

Bohnert said there have already 

been programs to help decrease 
these patients’ dosages, but that 
there needs to be more research 
done to understand how to learn 
how 
these 
programs 
might 

dangerously impacts the patients’ 
risk for bad outcomes.

She noted there is some 

controversy 
about 
whether 

other medications are better or 
should be recommended over 
opioids. However, there are risks 
to patients takingnonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs, 

common pain-relieving drugs, 
as well, she said. Many non-
pharmacological options, such as 
physical therapy and cognitive-
behavioral therapy, for pain that 
overall have less risks and future 
research could be focused, she 
added. 

commonly used illicit drug, 

with a total of 19.8 million 
past-month users in the United 
States.

“I hope that current and 

potential users will consider 
the potential long-term effects 
of 
marijuana 
use 
on 
their 

brain health, particularly their 
cognitive 
functioning 
when 

deciding to use or not to use,” 
Levine said. 

In 
an 
interview, 
LSA 

sophomore Jason, who smokes 
marijuana 
regularly 
and 

requested to be referred to 
by only his first name, said 
the results of the study do 

not impact his perceptions on 
marijuana use. 

“I really don’t see marijuana 

as a serious risk to my health 
short- 
or 
long-term,” 
Jason 

said. “It may affect my ability to 
remember a given list of words, 
according to one specific study, 
but ultimately I don’t see it as a 
barrier to my overall success in 
life or health overall.”

There 
were 
3,385 

participants, 84.3 percent of 
whom 
reported 
marijuana 

use and 11.6 percent of whom 
continued to use marijuana 
into middle age. From the 
data, Levine concluded that 
an average of one out of two 
participants remembered one 
fewer word from a list of 15 
words, for every five years of 

past exposure to marijuana.

Levine 
said 
that 
this 

statistic is significant, but the 
investigation of the effects of 
marijuana 
consumption 
on 

cognitive function is ongoing.

“Additional research would 

be needed to demonstrate the 
clinical effects of decreased 
verbal memory in individual day 
to day functioning,” Levine said.

It still remains unknown as 

to whether occasional or low-
intensity marijuana use earlier 
in life has long-term effects, and 
whether factors such as age and 
duration of exposure have to be 
taken into account.

Jason said he did not believe 

verbal memory loss was a life-
threatening issue.

“I haven’t looked too far into 

the research,” Jason said. “But 
verbal memory isn’t threatening 
to my life and I assume that I’ll 
slow down my consumption of 
marijuana over the course of my 
life.”

Self-reporting was utilized to 

assess the results of the study, 
which is sometimes considered 
a less reliable method of study, 
but Levine said this was not a 
primary issue for the research 
team.

“Self-report 
of 
marijuana 

use is the gold standard and 
customary 
approach 
for 

measuring 
an 
individual’s 

marijuana use,” Levine said. 
“I do not feel that it is a major 
limitation.”

Detroit Public 
Schools invests 
$300,000 for 
building repairs

Detroit Public Schools has 

budgeted money from other 
departments to repair some of 
the building issues in many of its 
schools.

This decision follows a series 

of sick-out protests staged by 
teachers speaking out against 
the conditions of their schools. 
Teachers called in sick in such 
large numbers that classes had 
to be cancelled on multiple 
occasions. 

The newly allocated money 

will go toward existing work 
orders for building repair 
in the system, and property 
maintenance and safety 
violations uncovered by recent 
inspections done by the city.

The inspections done as 

part of a district-wide review 
during the end of Janurary 
revealed multiple code 
violations including instances 
of rodents, mold and damaged 
roofs.

The inspections were called 

for by Mayor Mike Duggan after 
he visited four schools and saw 
their conditions. 

The public school buildings 

in Detroit have deteriorated 
as a result of the growth of 
the school district’s debt to a 
projected $515 million, leaving 
the district unable to pay for 
repairs.

Dearborn Heights 
man accused of 
planning ISIS 
attack on church

Khalil Abu-Rayyan was 

accused of threatening police 
and a large Detroit church with 
ISIS attacks.

Abu-Rayyan appeared before 

a court on Monday on the 
charge of possessing a firearm 
while taking illegal drugs. 

Though he was not charged 

on any accounts of terrorism, 
Abu-Rayyam faces up to 10 
years in prison. 

The FBI alleges that Abu-

Rayyan purchased a gun in 
October while regularing 
smoking marijuana. The FBI 
says that he reported that he 
did not take any illegal guns on 
an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
form at the time of the firearm 
purchase.

The FBI had been monitoring 

Abu-Rayyan since May and 
stated in an affidavit that he 
was a supporter of the terrorist 
group ISIS and has called for 
violent attacks against a Detroit 
church with 6,000 members and 
against the police. 

The FBI states that Abu-

Rayyan has been openly 
supporting and promoting ISIS 
since as early as November 2014.

benefits as charity, but rather a 
way to maximize the company’s 
overall growth.

He cited that Jeffrey Immelt, 

CEO of General Electric, as an 
example of this attitude, saying 
that one of Immelt’s core values is 
treating his workers fairly, a virtue 
that lends itself to the recent 
growth of his company.

“Businesses are understanding 

that there is indeed something to 
be gained from what my mother 
taught me, which is ‘It’s nice to be 
important, but it’s important to be 
nice,’ ” Perez said.

Perez also said empowering 

workers is an essential part of how 
competitive a business is, whether 
that is done through labor unions 
or other avenues.

Additionally, 
he 
suggested 

companies provide for workers is 
by implementing paid maternity 
leave for women and increasing 
diversity in the workforce.

“Diversity is key to our global 

competitiveness,” Perez said.

Perez also touched on wages, 

saying that during his tenure in 
the White House Cabinet, Perez 
said he has met many people who 
work full-time jobs and yet cannot 

provide for themselves and their 
family. Perez emphasized that 
there is still a long way to go until 
the United States reaches full 
economic prosperity.

“If you work a full-time job in 

America, you shouldn’t have to 
live in poverty, you shouldn’t have 
to rely on food stamps to feed your 
family,” Perez said. “We can do far 
better.”

Public Policy senior Julie Sarne 

who attended the event said 
hought Perez’s message about 
businesses providing for their 
workers was especially important.

“I’m really interested in labor 

issues and how we can encourage 
businesses to grow and also help 
U.S. workers at the same time,” 
Sarne said.

During his lecture, Perez also 

spoke about statewide issues with 
economic prosperity, including 
the Flint water crisis and the 
resurgance 
of 
Detroit’s 
auto 

industry. Perez said the water 
crisis in Flint was avoidable, and 
occurred because the community 
was neglected by the government.

“In this most prosperous nation 

on the planet, zip codes should 
never ever determine destiny,” 
Perez said. “We can’t succeed in 
Flint if people can’t even drink the 
water.”

On a more positive note, Perez 

said Ford, Chrysler and General 
Motors havebounced back from 
dire economic situations and are 
experiencing profitability success 
comparable to World War II. 

“What I love about Michigan is 

it’s a state of folks who understand 
the importance of resilience,” 
Perez said. “Every challenge 
here is met with a remarkable 
determination and resolve.” 

After the event, Public Policy 

senior Tommy Hoyt said he 
enjoyed the chance to hear a 
cabinet-ranking member of the 
federal government speak.

“Perez is clearly a principle-

driven man who is leading with 
a clear ideology of how he wants 
labor to be done in this country,” 
Hoyt said. “While he didn’t 
dwell on too many specifics and 
was often a cheerleader for the 
(Obama) administration, it was 
an overall worthwhile experience 
and I’m glad I heard him speak.”

Throughout his entire lecture, 

Perez spoke passionately about 
how the United States as a whole 
succeeds only when everyone has 
the opportunity to succeed.

“The rising tide should indeed 

lift all boats and not just the 
yachts,” Perez said. “Everyone 
who works hard in America ought 
to get the chance to get ahead.”

school.

Engineering 
Prof. 
Robert 

Ziff, a SACUA member, said a 
potential initiative would need 
incentives and budgeting from 
the University.

“There 
have 
been 
some 

institutional 
problems 
with 

colleges because of overhead,” 
Ziff said. “They don’t want to 
share the overhead, they want to 
keep it. I think this is something 
that has to be broken down.”

Ecology and Evolutionary 

Biology Prof. John Lehman, 
a SACUA member, said he 
agreed with Ziff, adding that he 
thought the idea was beneficial 
to the University.

“I think it’s great because 

we’ve got to improve the public’s 

perception 
of 
the 
academy 

and you’ve got to get them to 
understand that education here 
is not a private good,” Lehman 
said.

As 
well 
as 
increased 

collaboration, 
Schlissel 
also 

spoke 
on 
diversity, 
saying 

though the University has been 
addressing low numbers, it also 
needs to focus more on minority 
students’ experiences.

“It has to be pushed by me 

and it has to be enuciated as an 
institutional value,” Schlissel said.

Schlissel noted he has been 

meeting with student identity 
groups 
over 
the 
semester 

and felt that their sentiments 
toward diversity on campus 
have been relatively consistent.

“They 
don’t 
experience 

the campus in the same way 
that the other students do,” 
Schlissel said. “That’s one of 

my responsibilities: to figure 
out ways to work on our climate 
and to take advantage of the 
diversity that we’re going to 
build, to develop a climate 
where 
we 
can 
talk 
about 

difficult things.”

SACUA also discussed an 

upcoming faculty governance 
conference, 
SACUA 

nominations and the language 
for electing SACUA members. 
In particular, they addressed 
the terms of SACUA members 
if they decide to take a leave of 
absence.

The committee decided to 

draft two alternate policies 
for 
the 
latter 
and 
have 

them reviewed by the Rules 
Committee. The policies on 
term-return will be voted on 
at the next Senate Assembly 
meeting on Feb. 22.

University President Mark Schlissel discusses his desire to establish long term communication between colleges in 
the Fleming Building on Monday.

“Because I have all too often 
encountered 
other 
people 

trying to tell me who you are 
or what they need to be.”

McKinney also emphasized 

the negative impacts of self 
doubt.

“We ask ourselves, ‘Who 

am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, 
talented, fabulous?’ ” she said. 
“Ask them, who are you not to 
be? You are a child of God, and 
your playing small does not 
serve the world.”

Fox delivered the event’s 

keynote 
address, 
focusing 

on the process of success. 
According to Fox, there are 
three major steps a person 
needs to take to be successful: 
dream, declare and succeed.

Fox said during his remarks 

that people must believe in 
themselves and speak with 
confidence in order to be 
successful while they pursue 
their aspirations.

“We can’t use small words 

for big dreams,” Fox said. “It 
doesn’t work.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Fox said his 
keynote 
connected 
to 
the 

University’s Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. symposium’s theme 
of “Who Will Be Next?” by 
asking audience members who 
they wanted to be, and how 
they could achieve a nobler 
purpose and positively impact 
the world.

“When we say, ‘Who’s next?’ 

you’re next in the event, you’re 
deciding this is what you want 
to do with your life,” he said.

Fox 
added 
that 
being 

successful 
begins 
with 
a 

personal choice.

“Who will be the next 

champion? Who will be the 
next victim?” he asked. “It’s all 
dependent on what you decide 
for yourself.”

Jessica 
Thompson, 
the 

program manager at Trotter 
Multicultural Center, helped 
organize the event. She said 
Trotter wanted to provide 
a platform for each speaker 
to share stories about their 
personal experiences.

“I’m always so saddened by 

the reality that so many of our 
faculty and staff don’t get that, 
and I was hoping this would be 
a start,” she said.

Thompson 
added 
that 

Trotter’s lecture connects to 
this year’s symposium theme 
by telling audience members 
they can be the next to lead to 
create positive change in their 
communities.

“By declaring, dreaming, 

committing and succeeding 
you are saying ‘I’m going to be 
next — as a matter of fact, I am 
right now,’ ” she said. “Let’s 
not wait for next, let’s do it 
right now.”

LSA 
freshman 
Alora 

Fleenary, who attended the 
event, 
said 
she 
liked 
the 

“declaring” aspect of Fox’s 
action plan the most.

“Decide what you want and 

make it a reality,” she said. 
“Use the words of affirmation 
and speak it into being.”

After the event, LSA junior 

Sirak Kurban said he had 
learned how important it is to 
be an individual.

“We’re all ourselves and we 

all have a purpose in this life,” 
he said. “With our purpose and 
with our passion we’re really 
able to make a difference in

been donating bottled water 
and funds to support the 
citizens of Flint, including 
several groups on campus.

The Black Student Union 

started a water drive in January 
through a GoFundMe page. 
LSA senior Christopher James, 
BSU 
mass 
communication 

chair, said BSU is working 
directly 
with 
organizations 

they know and people within 
Flint to ensure the money they 
raise goes to the right places.

“We’re working with places 

directly within Flint, instead 
of trying to go online,” he 
said. “We are going to the 
city, talking to people, making 
phone calls to make sure 
everything is legit before we 
set foot and give money to any 
organization.”

James said he was upset 

that 
people 
would 
try 
to 

take advantage of the plight 
of Flint’s citizens, but not 
surprised.

“Obviously, I’m upset about 

it, but I can’t expect anything 
less,” he said. “Bad things 
happen every day, and it is what 
it is. You just have to pray that 
the good outweighs the bad.”

Stop romanticizing exhaustion

 Martin O’Malley 2020.

Yes, I just said that. The long-

shot presidential candidate just 
dropped out of the race after fin-
ishing third in Iowa, and his dis-
mal 2016 campaign is now behind 
him. He only secured 0.6 percent 
of the vote in Iowa and burned 
through his own money at an 
alarming rate, while barely mak-
ing a splash among voters.

However, I support Martin 

O’Malley. Any other year in a 
presidential race, he would have 
done quite well. Most of his ideas 
were progressive, yet fell short 
of socialism, and he has a proven 
track record of working with the 
other side of the isle. The only 
problem for him was that this is 
not a normal election year. With 
Trump 
stealing 
airtime 
from 

every candidate, and Sanders and 
Clinton fighting it out on the left, 
there simply wasn’t enough space 
for a third candidate for the Dem-
ocrats. It happened to be O’Malley 
who drew the short straw. 

Martin O’Malley is a quintessen-

tial Democrat. He embodies many 
progressive ideas, and has a set 
of 15 goals for the country that he 
would have implemented if he was 
elected this year. Some of them are 
things I hold near and dear to my 
heart. For example, O’Malley had a 
goal of having a 100-percent renew-
able electric grid by the year 2050. 
The environmental and economic 
impacts of that goal would be mon-

umental for our country and our 
world. He also wanted to cut the 
youth unemployment rate in half 
by bringing back job programs for 
young people. This would make 
college more affordable and would 
put money back in the American 
Infrastructure. This is a prag-
matic approach, proposing to put a 
real plan in place to accomplish a 
problem that everyone on the left 
has been yelling about for many 
years. Martin O’Malley is full of 
plans like this.

Additionally, O’Malley has the 

experience needed to run this coun-
try. He served seven years as the 
mayor of Baltimore, and during 
that time, he oversaw monumental 
change. For example, he lowered the 
number of homicides in Baltimore 
to less than 300 for the first time in 
more than 10 years. He also passed 
one of the first municipal laws ban-
ning transgender discrimination all 
the way back in 2002, something 
many municipalities still do not 
have. O’Malley cut crime and saved 
money, all while revitalizing the 
city of Baltimore. After that, he ran 
for governor of Maryland, where 
his progressive actions continued. 
He championed criminal justice 
reform, and passed the Dream Act 
in Maryland, which allowed more 
children to get a college education. 
He passed marriage equality, and 
included “Gender Identity” as a 
protected status at the state level. 
He even repealed the death penalty 

and passed gun safety laws, some-
thing many other candidates have 
not been so quick to support. Under 
O’Malley, wages have gone up, and 
graduation rates have, too.

O’Malley is also the frontman for 

an Irish rock band, and was rated 
as one of the most attractive men 
in politics. He’s also the only candi-
date on the radar right now who has 
any meaningful experience with 
urban areas, which are a key part 
of American culture. In fact, he has 
promised to bring back America’s 
cities and work with local leaders to 
revitalize and restore our neglected 
cities like never before. O’Malley 
isn’t just a good leader, he’s the lead-
er we need. Nobody else will work 
together with everybody in Wash-
ington to accomplish real progres-
sive change with people in mind.

I support Martin O’Malley — 

because he can bring our country 
together to accomplish progressive 
reforms in a way neither Clinton 
nor Sanders can. I strongly urge 
him to run again in 2020, and to 
hold strong as a Democrat and 
reformer. 2016 may not have been 
the year of O’Malley, but I firmly 
believe there will be one soon. So I 
say it again:

O’Malley 2020.

Kevin Sweitzer is the president 

of “Michigan for O’Malley,” a club 

that supports O’Malley. He can be 

reached at ksweitz@umich.edu.

L

ast night, I had two committee meet-
ings, got done at 10 and then still had to 
write my English paper!”

“Well, I stayed up until 

5 a.m. studying for my 
biology exam … ”

As I sat in Starbucks on 

a dreary Saturday after-
noon, trying to fight my exhaustion and the 
darkening half moons under my eyes with a 
steady flow of caffeine, these were just a few 
of the phrases I heard exclaimed by the weary 
students around me. While listening, I noticed 
a somewhat startling occurrence. It seemed like 
everyone was trying to one-up each other over 
the matter of how much sleep they neglected 
for studying, or how much they could push their 
bodies to the limit of complete debilitation.

In the past 10 years or so, with a rise in com-

petitive college applicants (and subsequent-
ly, students) across the nation, it seems that 
being productive to the point of deteriorating 
performance is the new vogue. A 2011 study 
by the American Psychological Association 
showed that students today are more anxious, 
depressed and have poorer sleep patterns than 
at any other time in this nation’s history. Psy-
chologist Gregg Henriques attributes this trend 
to the economic and financial pressures of the 
unstable job market and the obsession with 
testing and grades in schools.

We need to constantly be on the go, not stop-

ping to make time for anything deemed “not 
productive” — or else it seems we are worth-
less. Those rare humans who seem to never 
have time even to breathe, who are slender from 
a diet of meetings instead of meals, are held on 
pedestals because we simultaneously glorify 
slogans such as “no days off” and “the only bad 
workout is a missed workout.”

This semester, I purposefully scaled back 

on the strenuousness of my classes in order to 
have more time for both running and exploring 
extracurriculars. Though it was the right deci-
sion for me, it left me with feelings of uncer-
tainty that I wasn’t working up to my potential. 
Throughout high school, I would often leave 
my house at 7 a.m. and not return until late at 
night. By the spring of my senior year, I was 
completely burnt out. I wasn’t sleeping, racing 
poorly and had little to no interest in academ-
ics. I couldn’t maintain my façade of inhuman 
productivity forever.

Last night, I got eight hours of sleep due to 

the fact that I have a manageable workload 
and have finally figured out how to prioritize 
my time. Yet, I was left feeling strangely guilty 
about my decision to choose what worked best 
for me, and ultimately, the fact that I was not 
living up to society’s expectations of what a 
truly “good” student does during the night 
(spending it in the library). As I’m sleeping, I 
thought, other people are out there working 
hard to expand their knowledge and fulfill their 
hopes and dreams — while I lie here like a rock 
in my bed.

Instead of paying tribute to the things that 

matter such as balance, self-care and emotional 
well-being, it seems that our society has turned 
toward romanticizing exhaustion and anxiety. 
Coffee is not seen as a delicious beverage, but as 
a way of pumping caffeine into one’s body after 
too many hours studying into the late hours 
of the night. Of course, every so often, a very 

late night due to hours of work is inevitable — 
and part of the college experience. I am by no 
means declaring that students need to simply 
stop studying so they can suddenly morph into 
perfectly rested human beings.

However, we can only run on fumes for so 

long. Our body does not function on lack of 
sleep. Numerous studies have shown that over 
time, low sleep levels contribute to higher rates 
of anxiety, depression, poor academic perfor-
mance and even obesity.

In life, it is impossible to constantly be 

going — we are humans, not energizer bun-
nies. Thus, pushing, pushing, pushing will 
inevitably lead us over the brink of a total 
breakdown. In competitive running, for 
example, if you never scale back, you will 
eventually wear your body down and expe-
rience massive declines in performance. 
Though it is tempting to go out and pound the 
pavement for miles and miles every single day, 
desperately chasing a dream, it’s important to 
listen to your body. Doing too much with no 
recovery time is the reason a plethora of stress 
fractures and other injuries leave heartbroken 
runners pedaling sadly on the stationary bike 
for large portions of their season.

Runners and, to a greater extent, all athletes, 

are encouraged to take care of their bodies and 
choose sleep over “cram sessions” and adequate 
nutrition over missed meals. We know our bod-
ies will simply not perform at high levels if we 
fail to refuel the energy we are taking out of it.

However, why isn’t this message of proper 

refueling and balance being shared with all 
students? Though we all use our bodies in 
different ways, everyone has the same basic 
human needs. At our very core, food, rest and 
hydration keep us going — but a good laugh 
with friends, a day of simply doing nothing but 
watching Netflix and drinking hot chocolate 
or a nice walk in the sun never fails to boost 
my overall mindset. A strong GPA and work 
ethic will take you far in life, but someone who 
does not ever stop and cut back every once in a 
while will inevitably burnout.

This belief in never taking a day off — even 

amid injury or sickness, or days when you 
simply feel like you have the entire world on 
your shoulders — is twisted. That mindset is 
how I ended up with two stress reactions in 
my legs and mental burnout. The belief in “no 
days off” that is supposed to promote success 
and productivity, ironically halted my prog-
ress in its tracks.

Though totally transforming a recent social 

phenomenon is unrealistic, it’s important to 
know how to take care of yourself when you’re 
feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. Instead 
of frantically pressing on amid overwhelming 
feelings of helplessness, take some time to slow 
down and address the source of your stress. It is 
not embarrassing to go to bed before midnight if 
you’re completely exhausted. You are not a fail-
ure if you have to miss a club meeting because 
you’ve shed tears over whether you’ll complete 
a paper in time for the due date. The bags under 
your eyes are not meant to be shown off like a 
shiny new purchase, but rather an indicator 
that you need to let yourself recover. Your body, 
and your mind, will definitely thank you.

ast week, Daryush Valiza-
deh, the Return of Kings 
founder — known to his fol-

lowers as Roosh 
V — announced 
165 group meet-
ups, 
includ-

ing one in Ann 
Arbor. 
Valiza-

deh 
advocates 

on 
his 
web-

site, Return of 
Kings, for the 
legalization 
of 

rape in private 
spaces, and pro-
motes the view 
that women are 
solely valuable for their looks and 
ability to reproduce. Valizadeh 
has also published several how-
to books on picking up women. 
The titles include: “Bang Lithu-
ania,” “Day Bang,” “Bang Iceland,” 
“Poosy Paradise” and “30 Bangs: 
The Shaping of One Man’s Game 
From Patient Mouse to Rabid 
Wolf.”

According to Valizadeh, he 

planned the meet-ups to provide 
his purportedly large numbers 
of followers the opportunity to 
“come out of the shadows and not 
have to hide behind a computer 
screen for fear of retaliation,” 
and “signal to all that we’re not 
going anywhere.” The meetings 
were ultimately cancelled, pur-
portedly due to Valizadeh’s con-
cerns that he could “no longer 
guarantee the safety or privacy 
of the men who want to attend.”

Once I got past the irony that a 

bunch of rapey, self-proclaimed 
pickup artists cancelled their 
Saturday night plans out of fear, 
the whole story began to suspi-
ciously resemble a really awe-
somely 
organized, 
strategic 

publicity stunt.

Through 
announcing 
the 

meet-ups, Valizadeh got hun-
dreds of news outlets in multiple 
countries to publicize his web-
site, simply by doing their jobs 
and covering the story. The pub-
licity was free, wide-reaching 
and effective. The website expe-
rienced such high web traffic 
that it briefly crashed.

Manipulating the media to 

attract attention — and conse-
quently paying customers — is 
not a new marketing strategy. 
American entertainment entre-
preneurs have been engineering 
“bad” publicity to ignite con-
troversies and drive sales since 
at least the mid-1800s. Donald 
Trump’s presidential campaign 
does it today; his skill in attract-
ing free publicity by spewing the 
outlandish explains how he has 
pervaded public consciousness 
despite spending more than 99 
percent less on advertising than 
other leading candidates.

Return of Kings has certainly 

benefitted 
from 
controversy-

driven publicity before.

The first time I heard of the 

site was when it published “5 
Reasons to Date a Girl With An 
Eating Disorder” back in Novem-
ber 2013. Several friends had 
posted it on social media, derid-
ing its foul message about a dis-
order that impacts an estimated 
8 million Americans. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, I never heard 
someone defend the article.

Even still, the article drove 

new readers to the site.

Many probably didn’t like what 

they found there; if they actually 
did, the website may have even 
attracted new, regular readers. 
But the benefit of the newfound 
public attention was certainly 
for Valizadeh and his website — 
not the ideology or “movement” 
he 
represented. 
Web 
traffic 

largely determines online adver-
tising revenue. Additionally, his 
expanding public presence may 
have helped him sell copies of 
his books.

The 
announced 
“meet-ups” 

had a similar effect — though 
on a much larger scale. Accord-
ing to a Google Trends analysis 
of search terms trends between 
January 2016 and February 2016, 
the number of people search-
ing for “return of kings” and 
“roosh v” relative to the total 
number of Google searches has 
increased by 4,900 percent and 
962.5 percent, respectively. By 
the same metrics and during the 
same period, the popularity of 
the search terms “mens rights” 

and “pro-rape” have doubled and 
tripled, respectively.

In hindsight, the announced 

meet-ups seem destined to fail. 
Just 
as 
Valizadeh’s 
devotees 

have the right to meet up and 
promulgate 
their 
vile 
views 

about women, anyone else has 
the right to show up and protest. 
That’s exactly what many people 
planned to do.

And while Return of Kings has 

every right to propagate sexist, 
vulgar nonsense tailored to meet 
the demands of angry white guys 
who can’t get laid, anyone can 
respond by sharing countervail-
ing views.

Both actions merely play into 

Valizadeh’s publicity ploy, help-
ing him and his site reach more 
people 
than 
they 
otherwise 

would’ve.

The 
media 
firestorm 
sur-

rounding the planned meet-ups 
may be an intended outcome of 
Valizadeh’s attention-grab. It’s 
possible that he’s little more than 
a shrewd businessman who’s 
found a way to profit off a bunch 
of insecure women-haters.

But his followers are real, even 

if the meet-ups never were. The 
misogynistic views he promotes 
really do pervade some segments 
of society.

At the extreme, the idea that 

women are somehow morally 
culpable for any dude’s unful-
filled sexual desires result in 
events like the 2014 Santa Bar-
bara shooting, where a college 
student killed six people to prove 
his superiority over the women 
who’d rejected him.

Ideas that rape is ever per-

missible or that a woman’s value 
comes primarily from her beauty 
and fertility — ideas capitalized 
on, but certainly not pioneered by, 
Valizadeh — permeate everyday 
life. Given that one in five college 
women report having been sexu-
ally assaulted and that women still 
face unequal opportunities for 
advancement at work, misogynis-
tic ideologies certainly don’t need 
more advocates.

On new Elton, Yellow 
Brick Road is closed

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

For the Daily

Elton John peaked at “Can 

You Feel the Love Tonight.”

Since 1994, the legendary 

British 
art-

ist has been 
on 
a 
rapid 

decline. Won-
derful 
Crazy 

Night is Elton 
John’s 
last-

ditch attempt 
to relive the 
glory 
years; 

much like an 
aging 50-year-
old dad going 
through a mid-life crisis, this 
album reeks of desperation.

Throughout the ’70s, ’80s 

and early ’90s, Elton John was 
a force to be reckoned with. 
He was spontaneous, jumping 
from power ballads “Empty 
Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)” and 
“Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” 
to classic rock ‘n’ roll numbers 
“Crocodile Rock” and “Rock 
and Roll Madonna.” Elton John 
was in the prime of his life, and 
everybody could tell. His rich 
singing voice exploded with 
vivacity and liveliness, making 
any song an instant classic.

His new album is the exact 

opposite. Through garish and 

loud melodies, Elton tries to 
breathe life into an already 
exhausted career. His effortless 
dream of a singing voice is off-
putting when paired with back-
ground tunes that are just this 
side of trying too hard. Won-
derful Crazy Life is just a crazy 
disaster. 

At its peak of originality, the 

album begins with the song 
“Wonderful Crazy Life.” A 
whirl of tacky melodies nearly 
overpowering 
Elton 
John’s 

vocals sets the scene as he tries 
to drag his listeners back to 
the era of parachute pants and 
shoulder pads. “Some things 
you don’t forget, some things 
just take a hold / a wonderful 
crazy night like that takes you 
back, won’t let you go” he sings, 
and the audience is reminded 
why they should never try to 
revive the past. This song is 
a chandelier in a frat base-
ment: lurid, exaggerated and 
completely out of place. These 
unsuitable 
peculiarities 
are 

mimicked in “Claw Hammer” 
and “Tambourine.” Filled with 
muted guitar strums, “oh, my 
lord”s and uninventive, tam-
bourine-inspired lyrics, these 
songs are so unlike Elton John 
it hurts. What happened to the 
man that won hearts over with 
“Your Song?”

The only two songs that 

redeemed the album from total 
failure were the back-to-back 
“Looking Up” and “Guilty Plea-
sure.” These two casual rock 
‘n’ roll anthems were a breath 
of fresh air among the achingly 
slow and stuffy “Blue Wonder-
ful,” “A Good Heart” or “Free 
and Easy.” With both the steady 
beat and Elton John’s vocals 
keeping the songs from drag-
ging along, his abilities as a 
musician are somewhat vin-
dicated. The problem is, these 
songs only stand out because 
they aren’t as tedious as the rest 
of the album. Standing alone, 
they would be only decent at 
best.

Overall, 
Wonderful 
Crazy 

Life is a lackluster stab at rel-
evancy. Through trying to keep 
his old sound while also trying 
to channel artistry from cur-
rent pop hits, Elton John cre-
ated a chaotic album that is a 
burned out husk compared to 
the bright flames of his past. 
With 30 solo albums in the last 
44 years, his music is already 
timeless. It’s time for Elton 
John to take a step back and 
let people remember “Candle 
In The Wind,” “Rocket Man (I 
Think It’s Going To Be A Long 
Long Time)” and all that he 
used to be, in peace.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Sundance shorts are 
creative slices of life

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

“Festival shorts could be any-

thing,” a friend warned me, but 
therein also lies the charm. Bit-
tersweet, sensitive and surpris-
ingly funny, the Sundance Shorts 
touring program, which came to 
the Michigan Theater last week, 
spans genres for a gymnastic 
study of just how agile film as a 
medium can be.

Starting off is a naturalistic 

film from the US Fiction cate-
gory. “SMILF” tacks “single” on 
the MILF (“Mother I’d Like to 
Fuck”) acronym and reveals the 
unsexy reality of motherhood 
in a hilariously awkward casu-
al sex encounter. Uncomfort-
able physical insecurities and a 
mid-coitus conversation about 
the toddler sleeping on the bed 
beside them illustrate the bal-
ance between a single mother’s 
old freedom and shifting post-
pregnancy priorities.

Competing 
in 
the 
Visual 

Poetry category, glacially beau-
tiful “Object” is grounded in 
pursuit, a wintery underwater 
search from three perspectives. 
It switches between clean, geo-
metric shots tracking workers 
methodologically 
cutting 
ice 

and checking machinery, claus-
trophobic close-ups of the div-
er’s face as he swims through 
murky water and the still seren-
ity of unknowing pedestrians 
strolling far beyond on shore. 
Creative framing and a deft use 
of both sound and silence make 
it an immersive technical feat.

Next is the silly, animated 

chaos of the French film “Storm 
Hits Jacket,” where two scien-

tists ward off a witch-induced 
cow storm (yes: cow storm), a 
doom-be-upon-all evil villain 
set on stealing their invention 
and a side of spy-on-spy romance 
thrown into the mix. Scratchy, 
cartoon-esque animation ushers 
in delightful and progressively 
weirder oddities with every turn 
of scene.

In one of the program’s stand-

outs, “Oh Lucy!,” a middle-aged 
woman in Japan grapples with 
the loneliness and self-doubt 
of aging. She escapes colorless 
cubicle drudgery to conversa-
tional English classes where 
she adopts a Western name and 
the mask of a youthful, worldly 
persona to match. Actress Kaori 
Momoi (“Memoirs of a Geisha”) 
bares her character’s every vul-
nerability, and hearts pang upon 
witnessing her jealousy for a life 
and personality she does not 
have. In just 22 minutes, “Oh 
Lucy!” unearths a level of char-
acter development that many 
feature-length films dream of 
creating.

Casting audition tapes act 

as the narrative framework for 
the next short, “The Face of 
Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul.” 
The camera stays locked as a 

stream of dolled-up preteens in 
pink velvet pose prettily against 
a generic studio background, 
with tears, troubles and hopes of 
their nation’s post-war climate 
flickering poignantly beneath 
their pageant-level poise.

The program closes with the 

Grand Jury Prize for Short Film 
winner “World of Tomorrow,” a 
science fiction cartoon of a tod-
dler’s now adult, third-genera-
tion clone, Emily 3G, traveling 
back in time to show original 
Emily Prime the future. Both 
stick figures, Emily 3G walks her 
original counterpart through 
the spatially flat, simple vector-
designed internet void that is 
the new world. She explains the 
detachment that comes from a 
hyper-digitized extended life, 
where to experience something 
is rarely more than reliving pre-
viously archived memories. Her 
robotic monotone narrating the 
story reveals a startling depth 
of emotion, a bittersweet and 
wryly humorous juxtaposition 
against Emily Prime’s vibrant 
naiveté. (This short is also avail-
able on Netflix for those who 
missed the Sundance screening.)

For viewers who don’t have 

much 
experience 
watching 

short films, this is an excellent 
introduction. 
It’s 
astounding 

how such complex stories can be 
compressed into mere minutes, 
and these award-winning shorts 
use that space to experiment 
with technical effects or niche 
plotlines. But for all its serious 
artistry, the collective program 
still manages to stay accessible 
to emotions everyone experi-
ences. You laugh. You might cry. 
You definitely live.

ALBUM REVIEW
Young DIIV plays it 
safe on follow-up LP

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

As a relatively new band, DIIV 

still has some time to figure out 
its approach to music. After an 
entrancing 
debut, 
2012’s 

Oshin, 
the 

Brooklyn 
out-

fit 
cemented 

their style as 
an 
eclectic 

cross between 
shoegaze 
(My 

Bloody 
Valen-

tine), 
grunge 

(Nirvana) and modern surf rock 
(Mac DeMarco, Real Estate). 
Despite looking like most indie 
rock groups trying to make it into 
the music industry, DIIV’s mel-
low and pleasant sound is oddly 
refreshing to listen to, especially 
with tracks “Sometime,” “Fol-
low” and most notably “How Long 
Have You Known.”

With its newest record, the 

awkwardly titled Is The Is Are, 
DIIV disconnects from its multi-
genre roots and instead plugs into 
a simpler, more relaxed sound. 
But by attempting to deconstruct 
its composed and nuanced music 
into something very laid-back, the 
group ends up creating a banal, 
hour-long record that moves at a 
gratingly slow pace. The album’s 17 
songs all contain similar elements: 
a mid-tempo beat, glimmers of 
guitar screeches and reverbs, 
soft vocals and a general feeling 
of drug-induced numbness. And 
while it all sounds nice, Is The Is 
Are doesn’t take any risks nor does 
it break any boundaries.

Though the first few tracks 

radiate some potential, the major-
ity of the record squanders any 
possibility for something to pop 
out. The enchanting “Out of Mind” 
opens Is The Is Are, followed by 
the chill “Under the Sun.” But by 
the third song, the droning “Bent 
(Roi’s Song),” the album starts to 
tire — and there’s still about 50 
minutes left.

The rest of Is The Is Are is a 

rather hypnotic mess; there are 
moments when DIIV can sound 
captivating, but it’s easy to tune 
them out. “Take Your Time,” “Yr 
Not Far,” “Healthy Moon” and 
“Loose Ends” are such examples 
of that: their languid speed and 
faint instrumentals make for good 
vibes, but not much else. Addition-
ally, the dark and hollow “Mire 
(Grant’s Song)” is fairly reminis-
cent of Nirvana, yet it stands out 
not for its familiarity, but how 
much it grossly contrasts against 
DIIV’s own sweet-sounding musi-
cal pallette.

On the other hand, Is The Is Are 

contains some highlights, particu-
larly the drugged-out romance 
ballad “Blue Boredom.” Though 
DIIV frontman Zachary Smith 

doesn’t sing on “Blue Boredom,” he 
gives his girlfriend and indie rock 
enchantress Sky Ferreira the lead, 
her breathy vocals energizing the 
drowned-out production. The title 
track provides some much needed 
escapism, even though the album 
has already done a pretty good job 
of that; the dazzling, 17-second 
interlude “(Fuck)” sounds like a 
song waiting to be finished; and 
the poignant, multi-layered album 
closer “Wasted Breath” gives a 
solid ending to an otherwise drab 
record. 

While these songs are decently 

written and well-produced, they 
just don’t have the vitality nor the 
gravitas that Oshin displayed. It’s 
even difficult to hone and com-
prehend the lyrics, as Smith’s 
benign vocals are buried under 
several strands of noise. Perhaps 
the album’s lack of effort and cre-
ative sparkle can be traced back 
to the actual recording process. 
DIIV began work on Is The Is Are 
a year after Oshin’s release but ran 
into some delays for a variety of 
unfortunate reasons: failed ses-
sions with Chet “JR” White of the 
defunct indie rock group Girls; 
Smith’s drug addiction and arrest; 
controversial 
online 
remarks 

regarding bass guitarist Devin 
Ruben Perez; the departure of the 
band’s drummer Colby Hewitt due 
to an alleged drug addiction. Even 
with all that mind, it’s disappoint-
ing that Is the Is Are offers noth-
ing new for DIIV or their listeners. 
Instead of propelling to greater 
musical and thematic heights, the 
members of DIIV just kind of sit in 
place, not really sure of where they 
want to go.

E

nglish Prof. Jeremy 
Chamberlin opens every 
class with the same 

phrase: “Does anyone have any 
gigs they want to share?” He 
doesn’t just 
offer the 
time to share 
interesting 
happen-
ings around 
campus 
because he’s 
a fantastic 
teacher and 
cares about 
building a 
community, 
(although he 
is and does, and everyone should 
take a class with him if they have 
the chance), but because there 
are fascinating and neoteric 
ideas, groups and businesses 
emanating from almost every 
crevice of Ann Arbor.

This city promotes creativ-

ity and imagination through so 
much of what it does, but growth 
has been especially surprising 
and noteworthy in the burgeon-
ing literary community. Inde-
pendent publishing companies 
in particular have been inclined 
to take root in Ann Arbor, as 
love for books generated in the 
University flows with ease to 
the surrounding areas. One such 
benefactor of this ardor is Fish 
Out of Water, run by Jon and 
Laurie Wilson, a husband and 
wife publishing team based in 
Ann Arbor. They have lived here 
for 20 years but only recently 
acted on their dream of going 
into publishing.

“I met Laurie after she had 

moved from suburban Detroit 
to Manchester, England in 1988. 
We were married in 1989 and 
moved to Ann Arbor in 1993,” 
Jon said in a recent interview. 
“We had been considering the 
idea of starting a publishing 
company that would reflect our 
mutual love of fish out of water 
stories — about visiting other 
countries, having to integrate 

yourself into a foreign culture or 
simply growing up as a fish out 
of water in your own neighbor-
hood.”

After leaving Manchester for 

Michigan, Laurie insisted that 
the Wilsons settle in Ann Arbor. 
Both Laurie and Jon worked in 
other creative industries — mar-
keting and academic publishing 
respectively — before following 
their dream of starting their 
own publishing company.

“In many ways, Ann Arbor 

feels very much home-from-
home. We have met friends from 
all over the world in this six 
square miles surrounded by real-
ity. The diversity and vibrancy of 
the Ann Arbor community has 
provided us with a very recep-
tive audience. This is most defi-
nitely conducive to independent 
book publishing,” Jon said.

Listing some of the upcoming 

events in the local literary com-
munity, Jon said he was espe-
cially excited about them after 
just releasing the first book for 
Fish Out of Water.

“This is an exciting time, with 

the recent addition of Midwest-
ern Gothic’s “Voices of the Mid-
dle West” conference, along with 
the Ann Arbor Book Festival in 
mid-June and the Kerrytown 
BookFest in September. Both of 
these events have grown signifi-
cantly over the last 10 years and 
attract writers and an audiences 
from far and wide,” Jon said.

The first and newest book 

published by Fish Out of Water 
also bears the proud stamp 
“Made in Ann Arbor.” The novel, 
called “Love & Vodka,” was 
written by R.J. Fox, a teacher at 
Huron High School.

“In my first year (at Huron 

High), I had a student who hap-
pened to be the son of John 
Wilson and Laurie Wilson all 
four years,” Fox said. “I was 
publishing pieces of my book 
on Facebook and (Jon) just hap-
pened to be launching a pub-
lishing business. And the types 
of books they were looking to 

publish match the story I had, 
a sort of fish out of water. They 
approached me and asked if I’d 
be interested. I figured why not? 
It’s kind of risky. They were a 
new company, and there’s noth-
ing guaranteed, but it’s been 
amazing. It’s their first book 
so they have so much at stake 
themselves. We’ve really just 
enjoyed the last few months of 
getting this book out there. The 
support here in Ann Arbor’s just 
been unbelievably fantastic. It’s 
obviously a very literate com-
munity.”

Despite the challenges of a 

shoestring budget and adaptation 
to publishing and distribution in 
the twenty-first century, Fox and 
Fish Out of Water released “Love 
& Vodka” in 2015. It was met 
with spirit and warmth from the 
literary community, which Fox 
credits toward the general zeal of 
Ann Arbor.

“I’ve been living here in Ann 

Arbor for about 6 or 7 years. I 
feel like the literary community 
was already in place when I got 
here. I feel like since I’ve lived 
here, they opened up some more 
places. Literati’s opened, and 
they’ve been just phenomenal 
and want so much to support 
authors,” Fox said.

He added that he thought the 

literary community, hit hard 
by the recession and changing 
technologies, is rebounding with 
a life force that few would have 
expected. But he also made the 
point that in the bubble of Ann 
Arbor, we are fortunate in the 
enthusiasm that the University 
and the town itself generate for 
literature.

“People say books are a dying 

breed, but by the same token, 
these stores are thriving,” Fox 
said. “I couldn’t have asked for 
a better place to launch a book 
than Ann Arbor.”

We need to stop 
enabling Shinola

The corporate 

brand from Texas 
is using the Motor 
City like its puppet

By ANAY KATYAL

For the Daily

Growing up in Chicago, I 

always had a fascination with 
Detroit. For so long, I consid-
ered the Motor City my sister 
city of sorts — while Detroit 
and Chicago are similar in many 
ways, each city manages to have 
its own unique, distinguishing 
quirks. Detroit was endearing to 
me, and it came to take a special 
place in my heart. As a result, 
Detroit’s fall from grace hit me 
harder than it did most non-res-
idents. Besides, a city in crisis, 
caused by the malfeasance and 
mismanagement of questionably 
elected politicians, is something 
I can empathize with fairly well. 
I so badly wanted Detroit to get 
back on its feet, that I blindly 
supported any shiny new initia-
tive that emphasized any intent 
to “revitalize” Detroit.

Shinola soon made its mark 

on the fashion scene and Detroit 
revitalization 
simultaneously, 

touting “quality, Detroit-made 
goods” with a dedication to 
“American luxury and American 
quality.” With its shiny branding 
and lofty promises, I really want-
ed to like Shinola. A company that 
wants to give Detroiters a second 
chance on the backs of something 
that isn’t automotive? Great. A 
second chance on the backs of 
Detroit-made watches and other 
craft goods? Even better.

I told my Dad to go buy a 

Shinola watch, I extolled the 
merits of the company to my 
friends; there was even a point 
where I tried saving up for my 
very own Shinola timepiece. 
I can’t really say I fell in love 
with the company, because that 
requires a genuine, confident 

feeling of attachment; rather, 
like many others, I had a period 
of deep infatuation, finding 
myself in love with the idea of 
the company and its products, 
rather than the company itself. 
The slick marketing materials 
that tried to simultaneously 
appeal to a penchant for luxury 
goods and love for Detroit 
worked on me.

After the honeymoon period 

was over, it was pretty easy to 
see the false narrative Shinola 
was trying to sell to consumers 
like me. Owned and operated 
by Bedrock Brands, a venture 
capital firm started by one of 
the founders of Fossil, Shinola 
operates under the pretense 
of being a homegrown Detroit 
company, when in reality its 
corporate home is found in 
Texas, though its individual 
company 
headquarters 
are 

in Detroit. A quick look at 
Shinola’s website can give a 
fair bit of perspective. Watches 
aren’t manufactured in Detroit, 
but rather assembled using 
sourced parts from suppliers 
in Europe (the cheapest among 
them being ~$550). In addition 
to that, you’ll find $500 leather 
boxing gloves, $1,500 fixed-
gear bicycles and $50 felt 
pennants adorned with the 
Shinola logo as well as a $15,000 
“vintage” American flag.

Shinola 
bills 
itself 
as 
a 

company that works for the 
people of Detroit, but in reality, 
it’s a trendy way for wealthy 
residents of Bloomfield Hills or 
Grosse Pointe (or even Chicago, 
in my case) to feign a sense of 
empathy for Detroit’s problems. 
When a company that claims 
to serve the city of Detroit is 
trying to front a piece of fabric 
that costs more than a brand 
new car, one can’t help but 
think there are other motives 
at play.

I don’t really have a problem 

stomaching 
many 
of 
the 

byproducts 
of 
the 
Detroit 

revitalization 
movement, 
or 

the waves of gentrification 
that have come with it. All 
things considered, trying to 
generate a sense of positivity 
in a city blighted by a storm of 
poverty and despair isn’t really 
a negative thing. But Shinola’s 
insistence 
on 
perpetuating 

the idea that “Detroit isn’t as 
terrible as you thought, and 
here are some shiny, expensive 
products to prove it” does more 
harm than good for the people 
of Detroit.

By simply choosing Detroit 

as a backdrop for its products, 
Shinola thinks it’s better than 
other companies in the same 
business. Their ad campaigns 
feature smiling white people 
riding their expensive bicycles 
on 
city 
streets 
juxtaposed 

with 
smiling 
little 
Black 

children rapping, with their 
CEO remarking how residents 
of the city are “really nice” 
and “looked you in the eye,” 
as if the people of Detroit 
aren’t as savage as outsiders 
thought. There isn’t a genuine 
intent to see Detroit improve 
on the part of Shinola. They 
hope that by using Detroit as 
Shinola’s puppet, they can push 
a caricatured ideal of what it 
means to invest in America 
and cities like Detroit. I can’t 
see Shinola’s business model 
defaulting on their intended 
goals anytime soon, but for the 
sake of Detroit and its residents, 
remaining conscious of the 
reality of Shinola’s business 
practices would be a good first 
step to take.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

‘Crime Story’ takes a 
bold look at O.J. case

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Along with the multitude of 

other shows Ryan Murphy is pro-
ducing at the moment, “American 
Crime Story” 
is an anthol-
ogy 
series 

that acts as 
a 
companion 

piece to Mur-
phy’s 
other 

popular 
FX 

show “Ameri-
can 
Horror 

Story.” For its 
first 
season, 

“American 
Crime Story” 
takes the audi-
ence back to 
the 1990s and 
the 1994 trial 
of football star 
and actor O.J. Simpson. Arguably 
one of the most notorious trials 
in recent history, the O.J. Simp-
son case and its not guilty verdict 
still resonates with people to this 
day. This is an event that divided 
an entire nation, that the media 
made a huge spectacle of and that 

many already know the outcome 
of. But with daring camerawork, 
intelligent writing and spec-
tacular acting from a talented 
cast, “American Crime Story” 
is already setting standards for 
gritty television drama.

The show’s opener, “From the 

Ashes of Tragedy,” thrusts the 
audience into the story of O.J.’s 
trial, moving swiftly from one 
sequence to the next. It opens on 
a rather dour but relevant note: 
archival footage of the Rodney 
King beating and the subse-
quent 1992 L.A. riots. Though 
the Rodney King trial doesn’t 
hold a direct connection to O.J. 
Simpson’s case, the parallelism 
between the two signifies how 
the show wants to be perceived 
as not just a commentary about 
race, class and culture clashes, 
but about America itself. While 
it’s only the first episode, “From 
the Ashes of Tragedy” covers a 
lot of fascinating material, from 
the cops finding Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Goldman’s 
dead bodies in front of Brown’s 
condo to O.J.’s suicidal behavior.

Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers 

an emotionally stirring perfor-
mance as the season’s titular 
character, probably his best since 
his Oscar-winning role in the 
1996 sports drama “Jerry Magu-
ire.” Though he looks and sounds 
nothing like his real-life counter-
part, Gooding Jr. emulates O.J.’s 
charisma, aggressiveness, pill-
popping habits and despair dur-
ing the most devastating moment 
of his life. David Schwimmer 
(“Friends”) does his best in con-
veying Robert Kardashian, one 
of O.J.’s closest friends, despite 
somewhat whitewashing the role 
(Robert Kardashian was 100% 
Armenian). 
University 
alum 

Selma Blair (“Legally Blonde”) 
also makes a powerful impres-
sion as Kardashian’s ex-wife and 
current reality show gem Kris 
Jenner, evoking both Jenner’s 
physical features and personal-
ity. Though John Travolta (“Wild 
Hogs”) matches the mannerisms 
of O.J.’s confidant and defense 
lawyer Robert Shapiro, he falters 
slightly by giving an exaggerated 
caricature of Shapiro’s character 
rather than a three-dimensional 
portrayal.

On the other side of the O.J. 

case is Marcia Clark, played 
devilishly by “American Horror 
Story” favorite Sarah Paulson. 
In addition to Paulson, the best 
performance comes from Court-
ney B. Vance (“Joyful Noise”) 
as Johnnie Cochran, a TV per-
sonality and the integral lawyer 
in O.J.’s defense and criminal 
acquittal. In the brief moments 
he appears on-screen, Vance 
steals every scene he’s in with 

his gripping presence and says 
some of the episode’s best lines. 
During one tense scene between 
Cochran 
and 
his 
co-worker 

and ultimate rival Christopher 
Darden 
(Sterling 
K. 
Brown, 

“Supernatural”), Vance chilling-
ly utters, “The world needs more 
Black men willing to make a dif-
ference.” Amen to that.

The 
behind-the-scenes 

craft 
of 
“American 
Crime 

Story” is almost as good, if 
not better than the show’s 
actual 
depiction 
of 
events 

on-screen. Screenwriting duo 
Scott Alexander and Larry 
Karaszewski 
(“Goosebumps”) 

create 
powerful 
dialogue, 

while 
executive 
producer 

Murphy directs the episode 
with exceptional skill. The 
cinematography 
is 
well-

executed and immersive, with 
the camera capturing some 
fantastic close-ups and wide 
shots. 
Interestingly 
enough, 

two specific shots give some 
insight 
into 
O.J.’s 
moral 

ambiguity: both show O.J. from 
the back, the first being when 
he discovers the death of his 
ex-wife over the phone and the 
second being when he stands 
over her body at her funeral. 
We understand O.J.’s pain and 
suffering, but showing only his 
back clearly conveys some of 
his character’s restraint and 
uncertainty. It’s as agonizing 
and frustrating as one would 
expect when thinking about the 
ethical dilemmas imbued in the 
O.J. trial. The episode’s very 
last scene — O.J. escaping from 
the cops in a white Ford Bronco 
that would become an infamous 
chase on the freeway — makes 
it 
all 
the 
more 
haunting, 

especially with Nina Simone’s 
“I Shall Be Released” scoring 
the final seconds. 

The 
deeply 
rooted 
issues 

within the O.J. Simpson trial still 
exist today. The show poses tough 
questions about the case (the most 
important being: Did O.J. really 
do it?) — and doesn’t give many 
answers. But luckily, what “Amer-
ican Crime Story” has done, and 
will most likely continue to do, 
is highlight the case as a way of 
engaging viewers in having an 
honest conversation about what’s 
going on in our society, whether 
it’s about issues of race, class, 
fame or America as a whole.

Shinola thinks 
it’s better than 

any other 
company.

‘M’ looks to retool pitching staff

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

Backed by an explosive batting 

lineup and a lethal pitching staff, 
the No. 2 Michigan softball team 
enjoyed a magical run to the 
Women’s College World Series 
last season.

And though the Wolverines 

graduated All-American pitcher 
Haylie 
Wagner, 
this 
year’s 

pitching staff has the potential to 
be just as good, if not better.

All-American and 2015 Big Ten 

Pitcher of the Year Megan Betsa is 
poised to anchor the staff.

The junior went 31-5 with a 1.72 

ERA last year, and she believes 
that her big year, along with the 
experience of pitching in the 
WCWS, was a big part of her 
growth and development.

“Megan had a great year for 

us,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “She’s come into her 
own as one of the greats.”

Now, she looks to add to an 

already impressive career.

“We’ve talked a lot about not 

having 
expectations,” 
Betsa 

said. “Just because I was an All-
American doesn’t mean I need to 
try any harder. I need to focus on 
my preparation, and realizing that 
my spin is what makes me good.”

Betsa has become more of 

a leader as well. She is now an 
upperclassman with two full 
years of pitching experience 
under her belt, and has tried to 
pass on some of her wisdom to her 
pitching counterparts.

“(Freshman right-hander Leah 

Crockett) has been working really 
hard on developing her mental 
game as much as her physical 
game,” Betsa said. “She has a lot 
of questions, and I’ve tried to take 
her under my wing because I was 
in a similar situation — I had to 
work on my mechanics and get 
stronger mentally. I’ll be able to 
help her out and get a head start 
on that.”

Betsa isn’t the only experienced 

pitcher on the roster, however.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Sara 

Driesenga has pitched extensively 
for the Wolverines over her 
career, and was 4-0 with a 0.78 
ERA in 2015 before missing the 
rest of the season because of a rib 
injury.

“She didn’t hesitate to come 

back as a fifth-year,” Hutchins 
said. “She wanted to be here and 
to have her senior year. We’re 
very fortunate. It was a blessing in 
disguise, because she beefs up our 
staff and she can help us be great.”

Driesenga has had a long hiatus 

from 
pitching, 
but 
Hutchins 

believes she can continue to get 
back in the groove of things as the 
season gets underway.

“She still isn’t in the form I feel 

she’s capable of,” Hutchins said. 
“But she’s come a long way, and 
pitching in games is what’s going 
to help her get there.”

In 
addition 
to 
the 
two 

upperclassmen, younger pitchers 
will push for playing time.

Sophomore right-hander Tera 

Blanco was a ballyhooed high 
school recruit, ranked as the No. 
1 softball recruit in the Orange 
County region, and started most 
games at first base her freshman 
season.

Hutchins now looks to her to 

bolster the pitching staff.

“I told her at the end of the 

season that we need her to pitch,” 
Hutchins said. “She’s improved a 
lot, worked really hard and stayed 
here in the summer. She couldn’t 
train with us (because of NCAA 
rules), but she trained with our 
strength and conditioning coach 
and worked with one of our local 
pitching coaches.

“The big thing with Tera is she 

is a gamer. She is going to get a lot 
better when she gets the chance to 
get on the mound and I do expect 

you’ll see her.”

And while Hutchins thinks 

Blanco is ready for an expanded 
pitching role, she believes that 
Crockett needs more seasoning 
before taking a rotation spot.

“If I had my best wish, I’d 

like (Crockett) not to pitch and 
to 
continue 
getting 
better,” 

Hutchins said. “She comes to us 
raw and physically strong.”

How the pitching staff shakes 

out is currently unknown to 
Hutchins. 
Just 
like 
seasons 

before, she thinks it will continue 
to evolve as the season plays out.

However, she is sure of one 

thing, and that is how large of 
a role the pitchers will play in 
her team’s push for a national 
championship.

“(Betsa) can’t do it by herself,” 

Hutchins said. “We need a 
pitching staff. To me, how our 
pitching staff evolves is the key to 
our season.”

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

Junior right-hander Megan Betsa will anchor a pitching staff that should be among the Big Ten’s best in 2016.

Wolverines third 
at Stanford Invite

By BILLY STAMPFL 

Daily Sports Writer

On a weekend when a lot of 

people asked the No. 7 Michigan 
water polo team if it knew Jim 
Harbaugh, the Wolverines made 
a name for themselves with their 
stellar play in the Bay Area.

Michigan (10-3) won three of 

its four matches against ranked 
opponents and claimed third at 
the Stanford Invite on Sunday. 
It also rebounded from a loss to 
No. 1 Stanford on Saturday by 
winning out for the rest of the 
weekend.

Following a 

12-7 defeat to 
the 
Cardinal 

on 
Saturday 

morning, 
Michigan 
slipped 
by 

No. 15 Loyola 
Marymount 
later that day, 
9-8. Backed by 
strong defense 
and three goals each from senior 
Ali Thomason and freshman Kim 
Johnson, the Wolverines downed 
the 
Lions 
after 
overcoming 

what Michigan coach Marcelo 
Leonardi called “the proverbial 
Stanford hangover.”

“I told them, ‘We can’t allow a 

team like (Stanford) to physically 
push us around,’” Leonardi said. 
“And I thought they responded 
really well.”

Michigan, heeding the advice 

of its coach, answered with a 
stronger second half against 
the Cardinal and, following 
the aforementioned slow start 
against Loyola Marymount, a 
win over the Lions.

“(The 
Stanford 
game) 

was kind of a wake-up call,” 

Thomason said. “We realized we 
had to push harder, and I think 
that carried over to our later 
games.”

The Wolverines kept their 

momentum going into the next 
day, beating No. 8 San Jose 
State, 8-7, in a game that saw 
Johnson score the winning goal 
in the final seconds of the fourth 
quarter.

“(Johnson)’s been able to learn 

the system,” Thomason said. 
“She has a great skillset — she 
can post up, she can defend, she 
can shoot — which is why she’s 

been able to 
contribute 
so 

much.”

Thomason 

herself scored 
seven 
times 

for 
Michigan 

in Palo Alto, 
making her the 
ninth 
player 

in 
program 

history 
to 

record 
150 

career goals. She added one goal 
against No. 10 UC Irvine in the 
final match Sunday afternoon.

Not just an excellent player in 

the water, Thomason offers great 
leadership out of it for a young, 
still-growing team.

“(Thomason)’s development at 

this university is second to none,” 
Leonardi said. “Everybody looks 
to her at the most difficult times 
to lead us through challenges.”

Led 
by 
Thomason 
and 

Johnson, the Wolverines hope 
to continue to play up to the 
standards of top competition. 
Leonardi may not be quite as 
famous as Jim Harbaugh yet, 
but the coaches have one thing 
in common: They don’t let their 
teams get pushed around.

WATER POLO

‘M’ strong on hill

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

lost some firepower from its 
pitching staff to the MLB draft 
and graduation last season, but 
that hasn’t seemed to be a problem 
in the 2016 preseason.

The Wolverines, who are 

ranked as the No. 15 team in 
the nation according to Baseball 
America, are looking to improve 
on the mound after finishing 
79th in Division I with a 3.81 
team-earned run average last 
season.

To lead this charge, Michigan 

will rely especially on senior left-
hander Evan Hill, who missed 
the first two months of last season 
recovering from anterior cruciate 
ligament surgery. In the 38 innings 
he was able to pitch last season, 
he managed to fan 37 batters. His 
most 
remarkable 
performance 

came in the NCAA Tournament 
against Bradley, allowing only 
one run and striking out six in 6.2 
innings.

After finishing strong last 

season, but missing out on the 
MLB draft, Hill pitched in the 
Cape Cod Baseball League over 
the summer and finished with a 
5-0 record and a 1.80 ERA. Hill 
is anxious to get on the mound 
and be at full strength for his 
final season.

“The rehab was frustrating, not 

being able to get out there and help 
out in the ball games,” Hill said. “I 
feel comfortable now. I’m healthy 
and I couldn’t be happier.”

Hill credits pitching coach 

Sean Kenny for helping all of the 
pitchers improve their mechanics 
and watching game film with 
them.

“(Kenny) is there to make 

sure we are all on the same 
page,” Hill said. “We take the 
same approach going into every 
season: Stay relaxed, throw a lot 
of strikes and put the pressure on 
(the batters).”

The Wolverines also return 

their ace in junior left-hander 
Brett Adcock, who finished last 
season 10-4 with a 3.10 ERA in 
17 starts. In 90 innings pitched, 
Adcock struck out an impressive 

95 batters. In the Big Ten, Adcock 
ranked 
second 
in 
strikeouts, 

tied for third in wins and fifth in 
opponent’s batting average.

Though 
the 
prospects 
of 

Adcock and Hill are promising 
for Michigan, it will be difficult to 
replace closer Jacob Cronenworth, 
second on the Wolverines’ career 
saves list, who was selected in the 
seventh round in the 2015 MLB 
draft by the Tampa Bay Rays.

Junior 
left-hander 
Carmen 

Benedetti, who gave up just four 
hits in 18 relief appearances last 
season, hopes to help fill those 
shoes. 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich believes he could be used 
a lot more out of the bullpen this 
year.

“(Benedetti’s) 
growth 
is 

impressive in a lot of ways,” Bakich 
said. “He was a hard-throwing 
left-hander whose command and 
secondary pitches were not as 
polished. Now, not only is Carmen 
throwing two pitches, but he’s 
throwing three pitches. He has a 
breaking ball and a changeup to go 
along with fastball that’s improved 
in velocity.

“He’ll be counted on heavily 

at the end of the game in high-
leverage spots. If he’s in there, it’s 
because it’s an important part of 
the game.”

Benedetti, who also led the 

Wolverines last season with a 
team-high 71 runs batted in, 
focused a lot on pitching this 
offseason. He, like Hill, played 
summer ball in the Cape Cod 
Baseball League and worked with 
retired Cincinnati Reds relief 
pitcher Bill Bray to improve his 
pitching repertoire.

“Getting (Bray’s) knowledge 

about the game, what he has 
experienced, and with some 
pitching tips that he gave me 
definitely helped me and gave 
me more confidence towards the 
season.”

Alongside Adcock and Hill, 

sophomore right-hander Ryan 
Nutof is also returning to the 
rotation as the third starter. 
With so many returning arms 
and promise in the bullpen, the 
Wolverines have a reason to feel 
confident heading into the 2016 
season.

BASEBALL

Wolverines set season-high score

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Last Friday, the balance beam 

was 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

gymnastics 
team’s 
nemesis, 

causing the Wolverines to drop 
their first meet of this season 
against Nebraska.

Monday night, in a tri-meet 

against Eastern Michigan and 
Maryland, the beam became the 
team’s best friend.

No. 3 Michigan (3-1 Big Ten, 

7-1 overall) set a season high 
at the meet, easily beating the 
Eagles and Terrapins, 197.425-
195.875 
and 
197.425-194.075, 

respectively.

“What we did after the loss 

to Nebraska was just sort of try 
to make sure that our athletes 
knew that we had not lost 
any confidence in them,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“Just tried to make sure that they 
understood that we believe in 
them completely and totally and 
we need them to believe in each 
other completely and totally. 
Just go out and be aggressive 

and confident and they were able 
to do that tonight.”

Junior Nicole Artz, who has 

been named Big Ten Gymnast of 
the Week twice this season, won 
the all-around title with a score 
of 39.550. Sophomore Brianna 
Brown, who was named Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year a season 
ago, finished second in the all-
around with a 39.300.

The night’s dominant tone 

started off early when freshman 
Emma 
McLean 
stuck 
her 

landing on the first vault of the 
night, receiving a score of 9.850 
and loud cheers from the crowd.

The rest of the Michigan 

gymnasts had great rotation 
throughout their vaults, capped 
by 
freshman 
Olivia 
Karas 

getting judge-pleasing height 
and almost sticking her landing, 
helping Michigan to a meet-high 
49.300.

The Wolverines followed up 

their success on the vault with 
an even better uneven bars, 
an event in which Michigan is 
ranked sixth nationally. The 
Wolverines 
consistently 
had 

good 
extension 
and 
stayed 

straight when perpendicular to 
the floor, leading to a 449.350 on 
the day.

Most surprising, though, was 

Karas’s fall off the bars when 
she jumped from the higher bar 
to the lower bar. Karas, who 
was named Big Ten Gymnast of 
the Week last week, had usually 
been sure-handed on the bars. 
She did recover from the fall, 
though, and managed to salvage 
a 9.150.

“I really like that as a 

freshman, she showed a lot of 
maturity to be able to snap back 
from a mistake and do great on 
beam and floor,” Plocki said. “I’m 
really proud that she came back 
and did a great job on the next 
two events.”

After the uneven bars, the 

Wolverines had to go on the 
daunting balance beam. This 
time, though, the team had no 
issues, performing the best on 
the beam of any event on the 
beam. The team began with 
Karas, who quickly recovered 
from her fall on the bars to score 

a 9.875 — the fourth best score on 
the day in the event.

Artz and junior Talia Chiarelli 

capped off the beam by both 
sticking 
their 
dismounts, 

helping Michigan to conquer the 
previously-disastrous beam with 
a meet high 49.450.

“Beam is the event where if 

there are nerves, you tend to see 
them all,” Plocki said. “I thought 
that they competed relaxed and 
confidently and it showed.”

With one event remaining, the 

Wolverines were all but assured 
of winning the meet. Michigan 
had just the floor event — an 
event in which it is ranked first 
in the nation. With great height 
and powerful rotation on their 
jumps, as well as multiple stuck 
landings, the Wolverines were 
able to best both teams by a half 
point on the floor with a 49.325.

“This group of athletes loves 

to perform,” Plocki said. “We 
work a lot on that aspect of it. 
We really try to make sure they 
are having fun, and when they 
are having fun, they make it look 
easy and the crowd gets into it.”

“Everybody looks 

to (Thomason) 

at the most 

difficult times.”

Junior Nicole Artz was part of a bounce-back day on the beam for the Michigan women’s gymnastics team against Maryland and Eastern Michigan on Monday.


T

his isn’t what was sup-
posed to happen for the 
Michigan men’s basket-

ball team.

They were 

supposed to 
be a deep, 
experienced 
team capable 
of beating 
elite teams 
and making 
noise in the 
Big Ten.

They were 

supposed 
to lean on senior leadership 
from Caris LeVert and Spike 
Albrecht, the faces of the pro-
gram and the last two players 
remaining from the 2013 run to 
the Final Four.

They were supposed to 

rebound from a disappointing 
2014-15 campaign and make 
an NCAA Tournament run, 
and maybe even more, as John 
Beilein’s teams have become 
accustomed to.

But now, the team’s lead-

ers sit on the sidelines without 
uniforms, no win seems like a 
guarantee, and press confer-
ences that were once full of 
optimism and anticipation are 
now dominated by vague injury 
status updates, questions of 
mental toughness and a fear that 
all hope is lost.

Albrecht’s career is over, after 

nagging hip injuries and concern 
for his future well-being proved 
to be the only things that could 
keep him off the court. The 
Wolverines don’t have depth — 
they’re really only six or seven 
players deep, with no players 
beyond that showing any signs 
of making a positive impact in a 
game. They’ve beaten one elite 
team, No. 2 Maryland, but they 
were run out of their own build-
ing twice last week in blowout 
losses to Indiana and rival 
Michigan State.

And in perhaps the most 

mysterious story arc of the sea-

son, what initially looked like a 
minor lower-left-leg injury sus-
tained against Illinois on Dec. 
30 has turned into a 10-game, 
40-day absence (and count-
ing) for LeVert, the Wolverines’ 
unquestioned best player.

It’s been labeled a day-to-

day injury from the start, but 
as weeks turned into a month 
without any further clarity on 
what happened in the first place, 
LeVert remained held out of 
practice despite showing up to 
games without crutches, a walk-
ing boot or any other obvious 
signs of injury.

There were rumblings of 

LeVert potentially returning 
against the Hoosiers or Spar-
tans, with Beilein saying he was 
finally practicing. But when 
he took the court before both 
games, LeVert was in sweat-
pants and barely even touched a 
basketball.

“I don’t even know where he 

is right now,” Michigan State 
coach Tom Izzo told reporters in 
East Lansing leading up to the 
rivalry game. “I’ve never seen 
anything so quiet in all my life. 
I guess they’ve got better media 
than we’ve got, ’cause you guys 
would’ve dug in.”

He’s partially right — LeVert’s 

situation has been shrouded in 
mystery for weeks, but it’s not 
for lack of trying on the media’s 
part.

Beilein has been asked about 

LeVert at every press confer-
ence since the injury, so much 
to the point his tone borders on 
frustration when he spits the 
noncommittal clichés, “He did 
more today than yesterday” or 
“I’m not gonna share a time-
table.”

Might LeVert be voluntarily 

holding himself back? Not likely 
— according to roommate Der-
rick Walton Jr., they talk all the 
time about when he’ll make his 
return to the court. After all, he 
could’ve left the Wolverines for 
the NBA last year and nobody 

would have blamed him, but he 
came back to help the team.

And why is Beilein so cautious 

and guarded about the situation?

To some, it might seem 

unnecessary, but more likely, 
it’s just classic Beilein — being 
ultra-conservative, never tip-
ping his hand to opposing teams, 
never wanting to share more 
than he has to.

And really, all things consid-

ered, why should he be hasty? 
Why should he rush LeVert 
back? After all, LeVert has a pro-
fessional career to think about, 
and considering this is the sec-
ond straight year he’s missed 
substantial time with a lower-
body injury, bringing him back 
too soon and risking re-injury 
could have catastrophic effects, 
for both him and Michigan as a 
whole.

For a while, it didn’t really 

seem to matter that Beilein 
was playing it safe. In LeVert’s 
absence, Michigan played 
tough on the road against teams 
like No. 18 Purdue and No. 4 
Iowa, beat Maryland at home 
and took care of all the lower-
tier Big Ten opponents it was 
expected to.

But now things have gotten 

ugly, and the typical questions 
about leadership and mental 
toughness have come to the 
forefront. Suddenly there are 
no illusions that the team is fine 
without LeVert — it’s letting 
games get way too out of hand 
way too quickly.

Beilein has brushed off those 

excuses, claiming the Wolver-
ines simply aren’t good enough 
to hang with teams of that cali-
ber, regardless of who is injured 
and who is healthy, or who is 
leading the team and who is 
“mentally tough.”

And even with LeVert out, 

leadership is probably not the 
problem. Walton and fellow 
junior Zak Irvin have been 
thrust into the role before, gain-
ing wisdom beyond their years 

thanks to Michigan’s NBA draft 
turnover and injury problems of 
the last few seasons. 

The two are fine leaders — 

Irvin went on a fiery outburst 
during a second-half timeout 
against Michigan State, ques-
tioning the team’s resolve at a 
volume that startled many mem-
bers of the nearby students in 
the Maize Rage; and just a day 
after Walton vowed to “make 
his presence felt” against the 
Wolverines’ in-state rival, he 
engaged in a physical, back-and-
forth battle with the Spartans’ 
Bryn Forbes.

But despite Irvin and Wal-

ton’s best efforts, none of that 
was enough this week, and it 
probably won’t be enough going 
forward. According to Beilein, 
it’s tough to stop a team with 
a player like Michigan State’s 

Denzel Valentine, who can take 
over a game by making a few 
plays himself.

The thing is, the Wolverines 

have one of those players, too 
— he just hasn’t seen the floor 
since December.

“Take a player out of the 

lineup like Denzel (or LeVert), 
it’s tough,” Izzo said after the 
game Saturday. “(Beilein) won’t 
make an excuse, so I’ll make one 
for him.” 

Of course, Beilein may be 

right — maybe the Wolverines 
really aren’t good enough to 
hang with teams like Indiana 
and Michigan State, even if 
LeVert were healthy. Maybe the 
Wolverines’ win over Maryland 
was a fluke, and maybe people’s 
expectations are just too high.

Still, the Wolverines may be 

able to get into the NCAA Tour-

nament — they already have 
17 wins, a few more winnable 
contests on the schedule and 
résumé wins over the Terrapins 
and No. 24 Texas to go with a 
name-recognition advantage. 
But if Michigan wants to avoid 
getting its doors blown off by an 
elite team yet again in the tour-
nament’s first weekend, then it 
better hope LeVert’s mysterious 
timetable doesn’t keep getting 
pushed back.

LeVert alone may not be 

enough to save the Wolverines’ 
season, and his long-term health 
should always come first, but 
one thing is for certain: Michi-
gan sure could use him right 
now.

The curious case of Caris LeVert

Wolverines get wake-up call

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The ‘Iron D’ trophy is currently 

sitting somewhere in East Lansing.

After allowing a goal in overtime 

Friday night, the 
No. 5 Michigan 
hockey 
team 

was left as the loser of the Duel 
in the D at the Joe Louis Arena 
in Detroit, while Michigan State 
claimed hardware to make its 
upset victory even sweeter.

The 
Wolverines 
recovered 

to defeat the Spartans, 4-1, at 
Munn Ice Arena on Saturday, but 
realistically, Friday wasn’t a game 
they were supposed to lose.

Michigan State entered the 

matchup with just two wins in 
the Big Ten and averaging 4.30 
goals against per game. Michigan, 
on the other hand, hadn’t lost 
since Dec. 12 and was leading the 
nation with five goals per game. 
Furthermore, the Wolverines beat 
the Spartans twice before, 9-2 and 
6-3, in January.

That’s why, after Saturday’s 

victory, senior forward Justin 
Selman dubbed the loss a wake-up 
call — a sentiment his teammates 
agreed with.

“We definitely didn’t come out 

the way we have been these past 
few games, especially after coming 
off a huge weekend in New York,” 
said senior forward Boo Nieves. 
“We can’t let teams creep up on us 
like that.

“Every game counts at this 

point, and we really want to win 
the Big Ten. To stay on top of that, 
we really need to show up every 
game and make sure that we don’t 
(need) to have any more bounce 
backs on Saturdays.”

By no means are the wheels 

falling off for the Wolverines. 
They are still first in the Big Ten, 
but the loss wasn’t pretty and 
dropped Michigan two spots in 
the PairWise Rankings to No. 6.

They’re still in the driver’s seat, 

but the loss could end up being 
the wake-up call the Wolverines 
needed.

“Sometimes 
when 
you’re 

winning, you’re giving up too 
much,” said associate head coach 
Billy Powers. “You can work on 

it, you can focus on it, but there’s 
not the urgency because you feel 
pretty good about what you’ve 
been doing as a player.”

RACINE IS ROLLING: It 

was quite the weekend for senior 
goaltender Steve Racine.

The veteran netminder put 

together his best series of the 
season 
against 
the 
Spartans, 

recording a .949 save percentage to 
the tune of 71 total saves.

The Wolverines allowed four 

goals in two games, the lowest 
total in a two-game series since 
they played Dartmouth Nov. 27 
and 28.

Earlier in the season, Michigan 

coach Red Berenson stressed how 
important it was to find a way to 
win games when the Wolverine 
offense can’t pour goals into the 
net.

Now, it appears Racine may be 

the key piece of that equation.

“He’s definitely doing his job 

and his part in a huge way,” Powers 
said. “In attempting to obviously 
contribute to that (goals-against) 
number coming down, I think 
he’s found a groove, found a 
game that is working for him — a 
mental makeup that is working 
for him. I think he’s backboning 
our defensive mindset, trying to 
improve.”

BIG STAKES IN THE BIG 

TEN: The state of the Big Ten 
doesn’t do Michigan any favors. 
Half of the conference has losing 
records, and any loss hurts the 
Wolverines’ 
position 
in 
the 

PairWise Rankings.

That’s 
evident 
from 
the 

past 
two 
weekend’s 
results. 

The sweep against Penn State 
boosted Michigan to No. 4 in 
the PairWise rankings, but the 
overtime loss against Michigan 
State dropped it immediately 
back to No. 6.

“You look at the Big Ten’s non-

league record, and I haven’t done 
that, but I’m willing to bet that 
there’s one or two leagues that we 
probably played against that we 
have not fared well with,” Powers 
said. “That’s a league issue. We 
have to be better as a group in our 
non-league schedule.”

Added Nieves: “It can be 

frustrating to see teams that 

maybe you think you’re better 
than or maybe you beat, they rank 
up higher than you or drop a little 
less quickly than you. It’s just the 
way the system is and we can only 
control what we can do.”

With half the Big Ten in 

disarray, 
every 
game 
holds 

enormous weight — as losses to 
teams like Wisconsin can ruin 
their standing, but wins to close 
out the season against Minnesota 
and Penn State could be statement 
victories.

A 
REALLY 
BIG 
RINK: 

Michigan will travel to take on 
Wisconsin this weekend for the 
second time this season. The last 
time the Wolverines played the 
Badgers, though, was on home ice.

Now, Michigan has to play on an 

Olympic-size ice rink in Madison 
— something the Wolverines will 
prepare for by practicing at the 
Ann Arbor Ice Cube for the next 
few days.

But the change may be good for 

Michigan, which may be able to 
take advantage of its speed on the 
larger rink even more so than they 
already have this year.

“Well, when I have the puck, 

I don’t mind (the bigger rink),” 
Nieves said with a laugh. “It’s 
fun to play on a bigger rink. It 
definitely changes the game up. 
You can use the perimeter better. 
Rink-wide passes are a little more 
dangerous.”

STUDY BREAK: About half 

the Wolverine squad didn’t take 
the ice for practice Monday. 
And part of the reason for that? 
Midterm season is approaching.

While 
Berenson 
gave 
the 

team an optional practice partly 
due to the physicality of last 
weekend’s rivalry series, he also 
recognized the players’ academic 
responsibilities — something he 
has become known for over the 
years.

“We talked after Saturday, 

(and) we knew that this would be 
a busy week in school,” Powers 
said. “We’ve done it in the past. 
… It worked out really well that 
you can get a mental break, or a 
physical break from going out 
on the ice, but you can feel good 
about having a few extra hours to 
work on school.”

NOTEBOOK

ICE HOCKEY

Alumni weekend inspires

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

Before the Michigan women’s 

basketball team began its contest 
against Illinois on Sunday, the 
Wolverines borrowed a football 
tradition. Preceding the playing of 
the National Anthem and opening 
tipoff, alumnae of the women’s 
basketball program held up the 
classic banner reading, “Go Blue M 
Club Supports You” for the players 
to run under.

Michigan 
players 
ran 
out 

from under the banner during 
layup lines, going into the game 
hoping to come out with a win 
to make those who came before 
them proud. The special weekend 
also included an alumnae game 
before the current Wolverines 
squared off. This year’s team may 
have gotten the most out of this 
weekend not from the game, but 
hearing their predecessors speak.

Saturday, 
after 
a 
morning 

practice, the alumnae and current 
roster came together to have 
brunch. Former players, ranging 
from last year’s stars Nicole 
Elmblad and Shannon Smith to 
all-time great Penny Neer — who 
played basketball, softball and ran 
track and field at the University 
— talked to players about their 
experiences.

Sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty, who scored a career-high 
36 points Sunday afternoon, not 
only enjoyed running under the 

banner for the first time, but took 
in all the wisdom the players of the 
past had to offer.

“I think a lot of (what the 

alumnae mentioned) was not 
what they regret, but what they 
would tell their younger selves, 
just to be confident and have fun,” 
Flaherty said. “They said to enjoy 
their four years here, which I think 
sometimes within this process 
some of us kind of get lost, you 
have bad days.

It just reminds us to appreciate 

where we are and the opportunity 
we have and that we’re at a great 
university playing under a great 
coach.”

The weekend also reminded 

Flaherty of fleeting time, as 
she realized she’s more than 
halfway through her sophomore 
season, and in turn, close to being 
halfway done with her collegiate 
career. It renewed her mindset 
to appreciate every moment she 
dons a Michigan uniform and 
steps onto the hardwood when 
her name echoes through Crisler 
Center during the starting lineup 
announcements.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico also talked about the 
opportunity to wear a Wolverine 
uniform for the program, adding 
to Flaherty’s statements by saying 
it is something special that comes 
with pride and tradition. Barnes 
Arico loved having the connection 
between the alumnae and her 
team, as most of the alumnae told 

the players to be mindful while 
enjoying their time at Michigan.

“I think one of the common 

themes (from the weekend) was 
that the opportunity to play 
college basketball at this level at 
the University of Michigan is one 
of the greatest opportunities in the 
world, and to really embrace that,” 
Barnes Arico said.

While the Wolverines have 

gone through their ups and 
downs this season, losing in 
heartbreaking fashion by missed 
free throws or running out of gas 
down the stretch, the effort has 
always been there. Barnes Arico 
wants to ensure that each player 
is doing what they can, whether 
that means making an extra pass, 
taking a charge or even providing 
encouragement from the sideline.

The weekend only brought 

that point home even more. 
Playing on a team means being 
part of something bigger than 
yourself. It’s like having a club 
there for support before the game 
even starts. And Michigan didn’t 
need the banner to remember 
that.

“It doesn’t matter if you play 

five minutes a game or 35 minutes 
a game,” Barnes Arico said. “To 
be able to be a part of something 
bigger than yourself is really what 
the experience is all about. A lot of 
times, it’s about the people that you 
meet through the course of your 
career, more than, in 30 years, the 
wins and losses.”
