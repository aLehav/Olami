@Fingertips, a student team

competing for an entrepreneur-
ial grand prize of $20,000.
The competition, the Michi-
gan Business Challenge, is a pro-
gram at the Samuel Zell& Robert
H. Lurie Institute for Entrepre-
neurial Studies and is currently
in its finals stages. It offers stu-
dents as much as $60,000 in
funding and a forum for pitching

According to Anne Perigo, the
program coordinator at the insti-

teams presented their proposals
in the first round of competition,
which took place last Friday, and
16 teams made it to the second
round and are in the running to
win the top prize of $20,000.
However, money isn't the
only motivation for participants.

Housing gives priority

Due to residence
hall updates,
fewer beds will
be available
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Juniors and seniors who plan
on living in the residence halls
next school year may not secure
their dream room due to a new
housing sign-up process that
will be implemented this winter.

University Housing sent an
e-mail to all current residents
on Tuesday detailing the new
process, which utilizes reverse
seniority and begins in Janu-
ary. Students who have lived in
University Housing for fewer
semesters will have first prior-
ity in the room selection pro-
cess, and students with the most
terms in residence halls will
have the lowest priority.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said the clos-
ing of Baits I and the renovation
of East Quad Residence Hall
called for the review and change

of the housing sign-up process
because there could be between
150 and 300 fewer beds for stu-
dents in the residence halls.
"You really don't know ulti-
mately how the demand for
space among returning for stu-
dents is goingto balance ... until
we getinto the sign-up process,"
Logan said. "Nevertheless, we
wanted to make sure we had the
right criteria in place."

ing Linda Newman said Univer-

Major Dianna Williams, who

the organization is struggling to

Most of the volunteers at this

NEWS BRIEFS
LANSING, Mich.
Michigan House
may eliminate 44
state judgeships
The Michigan House is
approving bills that would allow
elimination of 44 judgeships in
Michigan through attrition.
The reduced judge count
would come in district and circuit
courts in many areas of the state.
The House was beginning
votes on the multiple-bill package
yesterday. Bills were passing by
varying margins, depending on
the area of the state affected. The
measures advance to the Senate.
The bills come after recom-
mendations made earlier this
year by the State Court Adminis-
trative Office.
That report also suggested
eliminating four positions on the
Michigan Court of Appeals that
by law is now allowed to have 28
judges. Republican lawmakers
so far have advanced bills that
would continue with28 positions.
MONTGOMERY, Ala.
Lawmakers call
for immigration
legislation changes
Alabama Republicans who
pushed through the nation's
toughest law against illegal
immigrants are having second
thouglts amid a backlash from
big business, fueled by the embar-
rassing traffic stops of two for-
eign employees tied to the state's
prized Honda and Mercedes
plants.
The Republican attorney gen-
eral is calling for some of the
strictest parts of it to be repealed.
Some Republican lawmak-
ers say they now want to make
changes in the law that was
pushed quickly through the leg-
islature.
Gov. Robert Bentley, who
signed the law, said he's contact-
ing foreign executives to tell them
they and their companies are still
welcome in Alabama.
"We are not anti-foreign com-
panies. We are very pro-foreign
companies," he said.
CHICAGO
Blagojevich to
appeal 14-year
prison sentence
Rod Blagojevich has one last,
slim hope to reduce his tough
14-year sentence: an appeal.
Experts say lawyers for the
impeached Illinois governor face
long odds in chipping away at the
time he'll serve for attempting
to auction off President Barack
Obama's old Senate seat and other
crimes.
Lance Northcutt, an adjunct
professor at John Marshall Law
School, says they must convince
a higher court that trial Judge
James Zagel made serious errors
at trial and in calculating a sen-

tence. But he says the veteran
judge has a reputation for care-
fully avoiding such mistakes that
could overturn his decisions.
KINSHASA, Congo
Congo election
results delayed
until today
The head of Congo's election
commission said results from the
presidential race that were due
to be published yesterday have
been postponed until today.
Daniel Ngoy Mulunda said
the commission is in the process
of checking each figure against
tally sheets from polling stations
in the remote corners of this
enormous nation.
Mulunda said: "We are before
a very demanding public." He
. added: "We want to double-
check each number, each tally
sheet."
Congo has been tense for days
as its people await the outcome
of last week's disputed election,
with partial results making vic-
tory all but certain for incum-
bent President Joseph Kabila.

BENEFITS

want the best and brightest,
that we want to open our doors to
people from around the world."
In an interview yesterday
afternoon, state Sen. Rebekah
Warren (D-Ann Arbor) said
the bills would put the state at
an "economic disadvantage" by
making it unattractive to some
employees.
At the time of the interview,
Warren had notheard ofthe bills'
passinginthe Housebutthought
the clause meant that employees
of public universities would be
exempt from the prohibitions.
"It sends the message that
Michigan does not have the
doors wide open for every kind
of family," Warren said. "And ...
given the place that Michigan is
in right now and our struggle to
rebuild our economy, I think we
need to have our arms and doors
open for all kinds of talent, and
we can't afford to be shutting
anybody out."
Warren said she thought the
bills would have the opposite
effect of what its Republican pro-
ponents in the Legislature had
hoped - reducing state expendi-
tures.
"If you look at that situation
and say, 'OK, we're not going to
allow public employers to give
benefits to people who have part-
ners,' those people are not going
to come here, and they're not
going to stay here," Warren said.
"So it actually increases costs."
University officials and profes-
sors have also criticized the bills
for risking the school's abilities
to recruit and retain top talent.
Several University professors
said last month that they would
consider leaving the University
if Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
signed the bills into law.
UniversityPresident MarySue
Coleman and University Provost
Phil Hanlon sent a letter to state
Senate Majority Leader Randy
Richardville (R-Monroe) last
month urging him not to pass the
bills. Hanlon and Coleman wrote
in the letter that the bills rely on
little evidence that eliminating

the benefits would reduce costs,
and the legislation would impede
the University's ability to attract
faculty.
"Fortune 500 companies
nationwide and in the state of
Michigan offer partner benefits:
It is simply good business that
produces an excellent return on
investment," Coleman and Han-
lon wrote in the letter.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for gov-
ernment relations, wrote in an
e-mail interview yesterday that
while she was not sure whether
the University would be exempt
from the policy, she was still wor-
ried about the impact of the bills.
"There seems to be some dif-
ference of opinion about whether
the approved legislation applies
directly to state universities,"
Wilbanks wrote. "That remains a
serious concern."
Like Coleman and Hanlon,
Wilbanks added that the pos-
sibility worried her because the
bills could threaten the Univer-
sity's ability to attract and keep
its employees.
"We continue to believe and
will advocate that these benefits
are a critical component - for all
public and privateemployers - to
retaining and attractingthe very
best talent that is so important to
the continued economic recovery
in the state of Michigan," Wil-
banks wrote.
Republicans in the state Sen-
ate and House have argued that
the provision of costs for domes-
tic partners constituted an unfair
burden on state taxpayers. Ari
Adler, press secretary for Speaker
of the House Jase Bolger (R-Mar-
shall) - a proponent of the bills
- said Michigan taxpayers could
not afford to fund the benefits for
public employees' partners.
Adler said Bolger voted for
the bills in the House because
state voters passed an amend-
ment to the state constitution
that banned the state from rec-
ognizing any union other than
traditional marriage. He said
public interests and curbing
government spending are more
important than the possible
repercussions of passingthe bills.
"We had to be primarily con-

cerned about protecting taxpay-
ers in terms of spending, and
we had to protect voters in what
they requested by changing the
constitution," Adler said. "Pro-
tecting taxpayers by reining in
government spending and pro-
tecting the constitution trumps
other concerns."
Similarly, state Sen. Rick Jones
(R-Grand Ledge) said he voted
for the two bills because he said
limiting state spending and hon-
oring voters' wishes were para-
mount. Jones added that he did
not think the passing of the bill
would produce asignificant effect
on the state's economy since other
advantages, like the availability
of affordable housing in the state,
would outweighthem.
"If somebody's going to leave
simply because of this, there's
plenty of other people looking for
work," Jones said.
The bills passed by the House
yesterday, like those it passed in
September, still refer to employ-
ees of government at all levels as
public employees, which means
the prohibitions would apply to
House representatives as well.
Members of Ann Arbor's city
government have protested the
bills. Last month, City Council
member Sandi Smith (D-Ward 1)
passed a resolution opposing the
bills.
Mayor John Hieftje said he
opposes the bills, and the effect
could ultimately lead to a "brain
drain," or the mass exodus of stu-
dents from the state. In the past,
he said, Ann Arbor's offering of
benefits to employees' families
has aided the city government
in attracting top administrators
and politicians.
However, Hieftje said the new
bills would make it "difficult" for
the city's economy and govern-
ment.
"Michigan needs people to'
come here," Hieftje said. "We
need entrepreneurs who choose
to work here to help us turn our
economy around. And by say-
ing to a whole group of people,
'We really don't want you here,"
which is what these laws say -
that's a problem. It's going to
work against economic recov-
ery."

BUSINESS
From Page 1
reality.
"There are some that use this
to really develop that business
that they absolutely do intend to
launch, often upon graduation,"
Perigo said.
Business School graduate
student P.K. Mishra, who is part
of the @Fingertips team, said
the biggest benefit of the MBC
is that the teams experience
all the challenges in making a
business plan and the substan-
tial amount of money the win-
ner receives is enough to start a
company.
"It's, for me, the most enrich-
ing experience of being in the
Business School," he said. "To
take an idea and launch a busi-
ness out of it, it takes a lot more
than just developing the tech-
nology."
Business School senior
David Spiro's team, Thru.
im, also made it to the second
round and is in the process of
creating a plan to develop a
mobile and web application
that allows consumers to text
businesses about food orders
and reservations. Spiro said his
team participated in MBC last
year but didn't make it past the
first round because this group
members only focused on the
technology aspect. This year,
however, they learned how to
create a business around that
technology.
"We're looking to build a
better business more than any-
thing," Spiro said. "While we
understand that there's great
cash prizes ... we're really most
concerned with the long-term
effect that MBC can have on us
as entrepreneurs and us start-
ing this business."
Perigo said MBC is different
than other programs across the
country in that it lasts several
months and has four rounds
rather than just one week with
a single round. As teams prog-
ress through each round, a new
panel of judges - often entre-

preneurs themselves - evalu-
ates the feasibility and market
viability of the ventures. In the
final round, Perigo said, teams
present to three venture capi-
talists in a "very realistic con-
versation ... that pretty closely
replicates what it's like to get
that first meeting with a ven-
ture capital firm."
The expanded timeline also
includes seven training semi-
nars, which spread over the
course of the competition and
tutor participants in pitching
their ideas, writing business
plans and executive summa-
ries and presenting to potential
investors, Perigo explained.
"Really, the goal of Michigan
Business Challenge is to ... help
students build their entrepre-
neurial skill set," Perigo said.
Business School graduate
student Sean Simpson, whose
team, Autobike, has made it to
the second round with a proto-
type of a bicycle that shiftsgears
automatically, said the train-
ings have been useful in helping
his team members develop the
business side of their project.
He described the seminars as "a
class (MBC is) offeringfor free,"
noting that his other courses at
the Business School don't gen-
erally teach entrepreneurship
skills.
According to Perigo, partici-
pants come from different areas
of the University, and often, the
multidisciplinary teams with
students from various colleges
and schools such as the Ross
School of Business, College of
Engineering, School of Infor-
mation and School of Art &
Design are the most successful.
Perigo added that though grad-
uate students tend to compete
more than undergraduate stu-
dents, there is a "nice balance"
of students in terms of age and
year.
Perigo said MBC is always
looking to engage more stu-
dents in the competition.
"We will continue to grow
and change to make it what it
needs to be (to assist student
entrepreneurs)," Perigo said.


PLANETARIUM

more expansive star field and a
mechanical projector instead of a
digital projector.
"(The Zeiss Skymaster) is
optimized and set up to do one
thing only and that is to show
the stars," Seitzer said. "(A digi-
tal projector) can do all sorts of
fancy things, but it has a lower
resolution and less dynamic
range so it's really not optimized
for showing the stars."
Another notable part of the
planetarium is its capability to
show the effects of city lights
on the night sky. This is done
through a system in which red
lights around the periphery of
the planetarium imitate Ann
Arbor city lights. Viewers can see
the projections once their eyes
adapt to the dark, which usually
takes about 15 minutes.
Rackham student Shannon
Schmoll teaches an astronomy
mini-course called Naked Eye
Astronomy,whichholdsits class-
es in the planetarium. On the
first day of her course, Schmoll
said she shows her students the
difference between a light-pol-
luted sky and a clear night sky so
they appreciate the contrast.
"I go straight from (the red
lights) to turning off ... all the
lights that I can," she said. "I
turn off all the classroom lights,
I turn off all the computer moni-

tors, everything."
As the lights disappear and
only the night sky remains, the
class usually reacts with sur-
prise.
"There's almost always an
audible 'aw' going on with just
how many stars you can see,"
Schmoll said. "There's a wonder
there that I think is really impor-
tant that the planetarium can
bring out."
The lights that surround the
University are a contributing fac-
tor in light pollution that distorts
students' perception of the night
sky, Seitzer said.
"There's more light going up
from the University of Michigan
than there is coming down from
the stars," he said.
LSA junior Emma Worm-
ser recently completed Schmoll's
mini-course this fall. Wormser
said she enjoyed having a class in
the planetarium and would rec-
ommend it to others.
"Rather than just using slides,
we actually had a point of ref-
erence, and we could look at
the stars and see exactly what
the teacher was talking about,"
Wormser said.
For Schmoll, one ofthe benefits
of the Angell Hall Planetarium is
its capability to show the night
sky clearly at any time of any day.
"There's no other place where
you can go and sit underneath
the stars in the middle of the day
and just ogle at the greatness of
the universe," Schmoll said.


HOUSING
From Page 1A
Housing staff and the Student
Housing Advisory Board in craft-
ing the new process. Newman
said RHA and University Housing
endorse reverse seniority since it
gives younger students a better
chance of living in a supportive
residence hall community.
"The RHA assembly started
with privileging seniors and then
really evolved to the younger
students actually have a greater
need for the programs, resources
and staffing that come with the
residential environment," New-
man said.
RHA President Haley Prasad,
an LSA sophomore, said another
factor RHA took into consider-
ation before passing the resolu-
tion for reverse seniority housing
was that it is easier for upper
classmen to find off-campus
housing.
"With the way Ann Arbor
leasing signings work, you have
to kind of have something fig-
ured out by November and a lot
of freshmen don't feel prepared
to make those kinds of decisions
at that time," Prasad said. "We
think that students, as they are
older ... are probably more famil-
iar with the way housing in Ann
Arbor works."
While University Housing
will not provide students with
alternate housing if they are not
granted a spot in a residence

hall, Newman said students who
look for leases in the winter are
typically able to find off-campus
housing.
Prasad said she hopes the new
process doesn't deter students
from applying to live in the resi-
dence halls out of fear they may
not be granted a spot. She added,
however, that fear existed for
students even with the former
seniority sign-up process.
"For sophomores, there
always was that fear in previous
years ... about what if you don't
get the dorm of your choice,"
Prasad said. "It's just that the fear
is placed on a different group of
students (now)."
After hearing about the new
sign-up procedure, LSA sopho-
more Killian Rohn started a peti-
tion to convince RHA to remove
their resolution supporting
reverse seniority sign-up. Rohn
said she thinks the new process
will push juniors and seniors out
of residence halls.
"I think it's a social justice
issue that (University Hous-
ing is) basically telling juniors
and seniors, we don't want you,"
Rohnsaid. "...I thinkiftheywere
to keep it this way, I think the
trend would become we expect
freshmen and sophomores to live
in the dorms, and we don't want
juniors and seniors."
Rohn added that there is only
a slight possibility that there
would be a shortage of beds since
a low percentage of juniors and
seniors typically return to the

residence halls. She said only 16
percent of upperclassmen lived
on campus this year.
"Why is someone who's paid
multiple terms of housing and
tuition ... would say, 'I want to
stay because I might not get the
room that I want or might not
get the dorm that I want?"' Rohn'
said.
Rohn and four other students
attended RHA's assembly meet-
ing last night and voiced their
concerns about the new sign-up
process during Resident's Time
- a portion of the meeting in
which 10 residents have two min-
utes each to speak. The assembly
consists of representatives from
each residence hall on campus.
At the meeting, Rohn suggest-
ed RHA should solve the issue
of a potential lack of housing by
"increasing density by turning
spacious doubles into triples"
instead of implementing reverse
seniority sign-up.
Engineering sophomore Jeff
Cwagenberg also spoke during-
Resident's Time and said he is
concerned about why under-
classmen could choose to stay
in Housing since they now have
first priority of rooms.
"Why does Housing want to
keep these freshmen who may
not have an interest in the com-
munity, (who are) deciding to
stay in based on the place they
are living?" Cwagenberg said.
"This forces out juniors and
seniors that have invested inter-
est in the community."

up to $199. Some of the high-
er-grossing locations include
Busch's on Main Street, which
averages $422 per day, and out-,
side Macy's at Briarwood Mall,
which collects $571 on an aver-
age day.
Williams said the char-
ity has raised $14,000 less than
this time last year, which is
problematic because fundrais-
ing during the holiday season
accounts for 75 percent of the
Salvation Army's yearly budget.
"It's very important that we
raise our money," Williams said.
The donations are used to
support the charity's programs
for youth and adults and pro-
vide goods for the Salvation
Army's food pantry and shelter.
"Whatever the need is, if we

can provide it (to our clients),
we will," Williams said. "But
without (the money), we may
have to cut those services ...
that's how drastic it is."
Despite the lack of general
volunteers this season, some
University students are still
trying to do their part. Alpha
Phi Omega, a community ser-
vice fraternity at the University,
raised $171 for the Salvation
Army last month, an amount
Williams said is "not too shab-
by."
LSA senior Spencer Shepard,
who was in charge of organiz-
ing the project for APO, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
fundraiser was very successful.
"It's a very important fund-
raiser for them, and we're all
glad we have the opportunity to
help out, as the Salvation Army
does a lot of good for our com-
munity," Spencer wrote.

FROM THE DAILY
Don't blow away power
Michigan should implement wind turbine plan
s the country's global energy demand increases, so does the
importance of finding a renewable energy source. In today's
society, renewable energy plays an integral role in provid-
ing people with environmentally friendly, clean and inexhaustible
electricity and heat. Michigan has the opportunity to implement
clean energy practices through wind turbines. By installing both
on- and offshore wind power sites, Michigan can become a lead-
er in renewable energy. Michigan legislators need to find a way to
provide funding for large-scale wind turbines and construct wind
farms within the state.

...this brings back very bad memories and
bad associations. That this is actually
happening is unbelievable."
- Virginia Tech director of creative writing Ed Falco said about the shooting at
Virginia Tech yesterday, as reported by The New York Times yesterday.

*I

Arbitrary standards

An offshore wind farm with 36 turbines
began operating off the coast of the Nether-
lands in 2007. The operation currently pro-
vides power for about 100,000 households.
The turbines are located six to nine miles off-
shore and are not, for the most part, visible to
people on a nearby beach. The first proposal
for the same type of wind turbines in Michi-
gan off the coast of Lake Michigan near Pent-
water was shut down last year after strong
opposition by the Lake Michigan POWER
Coalition - a non-profit organization com-
mitted to preserving and protecting Lake
Michigan's resources.
Wind turbines are one of the best sources
of renewable energy because once they've
been built and put into place, they only
require wind to function. America's energy
needs have steadily increased in recent years,
and if Michigan could supply its own renew-
able energy, then the state could reduce its
energy expenses and become more economi-
cally self-sufficient.
Legislators need to reconsider the pro-
posal to install turbines in Michigan. One of
the main arguments against wind turbines is
their unpleasant appearance and size. Many
opponents claim that turbines will reduce the
property value of lakefront homes if they are

visible. However, if the turbines are placed far
enough offshore, potential tourists and local
residents should not be able to see them except
on extremely clear days. And if turbines were
constructed in Lake Michigan, they would be
built a large distance from land to ensure the
highest wind power.
As a state with a history of industrial man-
ufacturing, Michigan has the infrastructure
needed to produce wind turbines. If the wind
turbine plan was put into effect, recycled
oil tankers could be used to install the wind
turbines far offshore, since this type of ship
is large enough to transport the massive tur-
bines. Implementing the project with recycled
oil rigs would be an additional benefit and
make the process more sustainable. Addition-
ally, this plan would provide a boost for the
Michigan job market, which the economy
could certainly use.
The principle argument against wind tur-
bines is the aesthetic concerns from water-
front homeowners and cities that rely on the
tourist industry. But by placing large wind
turbines far off coastlines, that concern can be
eliminated. Wind turbines are a tremendous
source of renewable energy, and the Michigan
Legislature needs to find funding for turbines
and create a plan to implement them.

made it to college. We all did.
And in order to do so, I had
to take the SAT, the ACT, the
MEAP and a
whole host of
other standard-
ized tests. I
trudged through
them, as I'm
sure many of
you did, because,
as frustrating as HASHA
theywere, some-
where there was NAHATA
the generally
accepted notion
that the tests were important. They
mattered - if for no other reason
than the fact that they supposedly
measured how prepared you were
for the next stage of your life.
But a recent Washington Post blog
post draws doubt on the ability of
standardized tests to see how well-
prepared students are for real life. In
Marion Brady's Dec. 5 blog, "When
an adult took standardized tests forced
on kids," she writes about the experi-
ence of one of her longtime friends,
Rick Roach. Roach is on the school
board of District 3 in Orange County,
Fla. He has a bachelor's degree in
education and two master's degrees
in education and education psychol-
ogy. He has been re-elected to be a
board member of Orange County's
school board three times. In addition
to being a school board member, he's
been ateacher, counselor and coach.
Roach decided to take the Florida
Comprehensive Assessment Test.
The FCAT is a state standardized
test administered to students in
grades 3 through 11 in Florida every
year. It measures students' knowl-
edge of mathematics, reading, sci-
ence and writing. Similar to the

Michigan Educational Assessment
Program tests for the state of Michi-
gan, the FCAT is used to determine
schools' accountability while also
assess student preparedness for the
next grade.
After Roach took the test, he
described his response. Here is the
conclusion he reached:
"I won't beat around the bush. The
math section had 60 questions.I knew
the answers to none of them, but man-
aged to guess ten out of the 60 cor-
rectly. On the reading test, I got 62%.
In our system, that's a 'D,' and would
get me a mandatory assignment to a
double block ofreading instruction...
If I'd been required to take those
two tests when I was a 10th grader,
my life would almost certainly have
been very different. I'd have been
told I wasn't 'college material,' would
probably have believed it, and looked
for work appropriate for the level of
ability that the test saidIhad."
Roach is a pretty successful pro-
fessional by today's standards. He
has been through undergraduate
and graduate school, and is cur-
rently working on a doctorate. He
presides over an organization con-
sisting of 22,000 employees and a
$3 billion budget. The fact that he
couldn't answer most of the ques-
tions on the test is telling. It isn't_
that standardized tests are too hard
or that students who do poorly are
stupid or lazy, but the style of ques-
tioning on the tests is obscure and
abstract. The types of questions
asked and the criteria for passing or
failing seems tobe arbitrary at best.
And, as Roach says, much of the
concepts - especially in the math
portion - that students are tested
on will not be applicable in most
college and professional careers

(with the exception of the few who
become math majors or go into
business). How can a test claim to
adequately assess how likely stu-
dents are to succeed in the future
if the material being tested has
no connection to the criteria by
which success is measured in the
real world? And should such tests
be used to rank schools, determine
readiness for college, or grant fed-
eral funding to schools?
State tests don't
accurately reflect
academic ability.

Standardized test scores play a
large role in determining schools'
reputations and in gauging wheth-
er students are or aren't "college
material" (as Roach puts it). But,
when successful professionals with
bachelor's and master's degrees
are clueless about a majority of
the questions, something is wrong.
Many have made the argument that
standardized tests don't accurately
reflect a students' true abilities.
Roach's experiment shows that the
tests don't relate to how the real
world functions either. And yet,
they continue to shape the future of
countless people. Perhaps it is time
to re-evaluate the role that stan-
dardized tests, specifically state
administrated ones, playin the edu-
cation system.

Eviction is against our values

Over winter break, many Jewish students -
including40 from the University -will depart
on Birthright trips to Israel, celebrating their
connection to a land that has been home to
both Jews and Palestinians for thousands of
years. Many of those involved nationally with
J Street U and J Street UMich were introduced
to the land and its people through Taglit-Birth-
right. We are excited that others are traveling
to Israel, but we want to ensure that our com-
munity engages with the history of the land
in a way that is consistent with our values.
Unfortunately, an ongoing attempt to evict a
Palestinian family from their home in East
Jerusalem illustrates the challenge of aligning
our experience with those values.
The Sumarins are a Palestinian family living
in Silwan, a predominantly Arab neighborhood
in the Old City of Jerusalem. The City of David
is a tourist site in Jerusalem that is the putative
location of the ancient political capital of King
David. It is managed by the non-profit organi-
zation Ir David Foundation (Amutat El-Ad),
which has a rigid political agenda to increase
Jewish presence in Arab neighborhoods. The
Sumarin home is located within the City of
David National Park, and has become a victim
of the controversial Absentee Property Law,
which states that any property whose owner
and/or heirs were not physically present after
1967 would be turned overto the state of Israel.
Musa Sumarin, the home's original owner,
died in 1983 while his three sons were living
outside of Israel. However, other members of
the Sumarin family have continuously lived
on the property for decades, with the permis-
sion of the owners. The Israeli government
declared the Sumarin home an Absentee Prop-
erty in 1991 and turned it over to the group
Himnuta - a subsidary of the Jewish National
Fund (JNF) - slapping the Sumarin family of
12 with an eviction notice and sparking a long
legal battle. The most recent date of eviction,
Nov. 28, was postponed due to outcry from
Israeli and international protesters, including
Rabbis for Human Rights - an Israeli organi-
zation of Rabbis and Rabbinical students that
advocates for human rights. The postponement
was announced bythe JNF.
Yes, that JNF - the one our Jewish com-
munity centers, day schools and synagogues all
collected tzedekah, charity, for in blue boxes to
help plant trees in Israel. The JNF was integral

to the founding of Israel and now maintains
Israel's parks and historic sites. But in addi-
tion to these noble tasks, itcalso owns and oper-
ates Himnuta, an organization that does what
the JNF officially does not - obtains proper-
ties over the Green Line, the demarcation line
established in the 1949 Armistice Agreements
separating Israel from its neighbors, and turns
them over to settler organizations like Elad, as
Himnuta has done over and over again in Sil-
wan. Clearly, this is not an isolated incident.
These groups are dedicated to de-Arabizing
East Jerusalem and preventing it from becom-
ing part of any future Palestinian state.
JNF claims that it is not accountable for the
actions of Himnuta, despite all evidence to the
contrary. We hope thatthe JNF will build upon
its legacy - of bringing the dream of a Jewish
homeland into fruition - by acting to support,
rather than oppose, a two-state solution and
stopping the Sumarins' eviction and all further
activity over the Green Line.
Birthright participants from the Universi-
ty's campus who are scheduled to take a tour of
the City of David should question the implica-
tions of the site for displaced Palestinian fami-
lies. Trips to explore Jewish identity should
not usurp the identities and rights of others.
Recognizing and respecting Palestinian ties
to their land does not threaten or delegitimize
Israel; rather, it creates an empathetic dialogue
among all those who love the land - Israel,
Gaza and the West Bank.
J Street UMich strongly believes that this
can only come through a two-state solution. As
American, Israeli and Palestinian politics alike
become more divided, we must take advantage
of the unique opportunities on our campus.
While our viewpoints may differ, we should
all agree that the events in Silwan are against
our values as a Michigan community, and we
can no longer allow antagonistic and divisive
actions such as these to characterize the Israe-
li-Palestinian situation. In the new semester
and the New Year (with a presidential election,
no less), J Street UMich hopes to work with
others on our campus to engage in robust dia-
logue and undergo collective activism that are
characterized by civility, empathy and, above
all, a commitment to peace.
This viewpoint was written on behalf of J Street
UMich by Mandy Kain. She is a Rackham student.


One 'sweet' resource

When I was much young-
er, the Microsoft Word
spell-checker was my
only editor. As
I advanced as a
writer, I learned
that in addition
to electronic
help, there were
many resources
out there that
could help me LEAH
with my writing POTKIN
- not the least
of which were
my parents.
However, I always bristled at their
criticism (read: advice), so I was
excited when I had the opportunity
to work with my peers on my high
school newspaper. While I ben-
efited greatly from my time spent
working with peers, when I came
to the University, it was back to the
spell-checker.
This is not to say that the Univer-
sity doesn't offer the appropriate
resources for peer help, but rather
that I was unfamiliar with them.
Before my sophomore year, I had
little to no idea what the Sweetland
Writing Center was. Quite frankly,
the extent of my knowledge was
that one of my classes met in a room
inside the center. Early in my junior
year, I was introduced to Sweetland
as a place where "troubled writers"
could get help. I reluctantly checked
it out, and was surprised and thrilled
to discover that it was a place for all
types of writers, troubled or accom-
plished, to sharpen and develop their
writing skills. Since then, I have
trained to become a Sweetland peer

tutor and have learned firsthand
whatthis previouslyunfamiliar place
has to offer. So, with the end of the
semester looming and final paper due
dates approaching, students - strug-
gling or not - should familiarize
themselves with Sweetland and take
advantage of its myriad of resources.
Quite often, students stereotype
writing centers as places where
challenged, or dare I say "bad,"
writers are sent for help. Unfortu-
nately, teachers often do little to
combat this misconception as they
often recommend that struggling
writers pay a visit to Sweetland.
And while Sweetland is indeed a
great resource for students, it is by
no means a place only for the strug-
gling. Anyone can benefit from a
visit to the writing center, and stu-
dents from all different schools and
departments should realize how
much they can learn from engaging
in one-on-one dialogue about their
writing. Sweetland tutors are there
to help students brainstorm, struc-
ture and edit, while catefing direct-
ly to students' needs - whatever
they may be. And while I under-
stand that there are people who
feel confident enough in their work
to go at it alone, I think I'd be hard
pressed to find a student on campus
who hasn't struggled at some point
in the writing process.
That being said, because stu-
dents frequently feel embarrassed
about needing extra help, teach-
ers, students and tutors must work
together to break the undeserved
stigma of writing centers. There is
no shame in either needing or want-
ing help, and students should know

that writers of all levels and needs
are welcomed at Sweetland. In fact,
students should realize how lucky
they are to have such an amazing
and free resource at their disposal,
as few other tutoring services on
campus are cost-free (I know peo-
ple who have shelled out hundreds
of dollars on tutoring in a single
semester). And because there is no
charge for appointments - most of
which are on a walk-in basis - stu-
dents simply have no excuse for not
visiting the center. Sweetland even
offers online tutoring for students
who either can't fit a one-on-one
session into their schedules, or who
are uncomfortable speaking about
their work in a personal setting.
Students should
use University's
writing center.
So, as you work on your final
drafts, or as you begin drafting, be
sure to remember that Sweetland
is only a short walk or e-mail away.
By visiting Sweetland, you have the
opportunity to improve not onlythe
paper you are working on, but your
writing skills and abilities. Tutors
are always happy to see new faces,
and though the separation might
be hard at first, I doubt your spell-
checker will miss you too much.

al. From $9
Originally
writtenin1707byIrish playwright
George Farquhar, the story was
an instant-success. Under Crom-
well's rule during the Puritan
S regime, stage performances were
banned. Like other Restoration
pieces - plays performed after
the ban was lifted - "The Beaux'
Stratagem" evokes the fervor of
the English dramatic renaissance
that followed the oppression.
Priscilla Lindsay, chair of the
Department of Theatre & Drama
and director of the show, said the
ostensibly aged piece will still be

relevant to audiences because
of its intended viewership when
originally performed.
"What were the issues back
then, what are the issues now?"
Lindsay asked. "These types of
plays, Restoration pieces, were
written for the common man,
instead of court. Issues such as
sex, money and relationships
were all really important."
These themes, which were
present in the inaugural produc-
tion, translate to the adaptation
begun by Thornton Wilder ("Our
Town") in 1939 and finished by
Ken Ludwig ("Lend Me a Tenor")
in early 2005.
Thisversion of the show, which
is used by the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, follows two
young gentlemen who decide to
take their last bit of money and
put it to practical and comical use
- finding wealthy ladies to marry.
Their plansgo awry almost imme-
diately.
This adaptation, though hon-
eat to the original script, gives the
show new breath and meaning in
this day and age.
"(Ludwig) adapted it for mod-
ern times," Lindsay said. "He
cleared away the cobwebs and
took away jokes that we don't care
about or get anymore. It is very
accessible for us today."
Reed Campbell, an MT&D
senior who plays Boniface, the
landlord of the Boniface Inn, said

he thinks that despite antiquated
dress and speech, the show holds
onto what's vital.
"The thing about good theater
is you can name any play that you
like and you're going to find that
the majority of it you can take, put
it in (the context of) today, and it
will still be relevant," Campbell
said.
Characters like Boniface keep
the show moving quickly, making
it fast-paced and engaging,Lind-
say said.
"As the plot starts to unravel,
a new character comes and -
boom! - something else happens,
or a new piece of information is
learned and things change," she
said. "There's a character named
Lady Bountiful, the mother of
one of the girls (seduced by the
beaux), and she fancies herself a
physician, only she kills as many
as she cures."
Campbell said he believes the
unanticipated twists are what
make the show slapstick and
bawdy - a refreshing version of
theater, unlike the minimalistic
and contemporary acting that
rules stages today.
"There's alot of physical com-
edy, which is awesome because in
this day and age modern acting is
really small, contemporary and
truthful," Campbell said. "But
this is really over-the-top, and
while it's all set in reality there are
big, bold jokes."

by time constraints. The original
production had a run on Broad-
way in 2005 and featured School
of Music, Theatre & Dance alum
Danny Gurwin as Laurie. Gur-
win, who is directing this MT&D
production, will share his knowl-
edge of the show's intricacies
with the student actors he directs.
"Besides being an energetic
and enthusiastic director, he
really loves the piece because
he's been with it through many,
many incarnations," said MT&D
senior Ali Gordon, who plays
the youngest March sister, Amy.
"He's taken his knowledge of all
(his) productions ... and he's sort
of brought them all to the table at
this one great production of 'Lit-

"Little Women" originally ran on Broadway in 2005.

tle Women."'
Though "Little Women" is
characterized by the ubiquitous
themes of family, loyalty and
love, Alcott did not portray these
themes from a masculine angle,
but rather from the viewpoint of
the oldest March sister, Jo. The
author, who Gordon describes as
a "proto-feminist," allowed her
female characters to make their
own choices rather than depend-
ing on the wishes of the men in
their lives.
Older women may relate to the
struggle of the mother Marmee,
who attempts to raise her chil-
dren in the absence of her hus-
band, and younger siblings may
connect to the troubles of Amy,
as everything she owns is handed
down to her from her older sisters.
"It's still read so widely today
and adapted so widely into
musicals and operas and movies
because people see these rela-
tionships and find that they mir-
ror their own lives so truthfully,"
said Gordon. "I still see some of
myself in this young girl."

MT&D junior Jane Bruce said
the show's theme of family gives it
a timeless nature.
"Ultimately that's what we all
come from, and always have," she
said.
Bruce, who plays Jo, said
she was able to draw parallels
between her character and col-
lege students like herself.
Broadway cast
member directs.
"(Students) are dealing with
the struggles of love and finding
your passions in life," Bruce said.
"And how you decide what to do
and finding that balance between
being independent and living the
life you always wanted to live and
stayingtrue toyour roots.
"It's something I know, in col-
lege, I've certainly battled with
and tried to figure out in the same
way Jo has."

to evoke a certain story for the
audience.
Contrary to the presence she
evokes on stage, Morris said she
is actually a very shy person.
But being an actress gave her an
opportunity to be something else
and hide behind an alter ego. This
gave her the confidence to go
on stage and perform in front of
crowds.
Bolcom and
Morris are both
MT&D faculty
members.
"Oscar Wilde once said, 'If
you want a man to tell the truth,
give him a mask,'" Morris said.
"It is not that I become someone
else - I find it within myself. It is
something I work with in order
to figure out how I'm goingto tell
the story."
Bolcom said Morris's experi-
ence is similar to a song the duo
has recorded, "Tamara, Queen
of the Nile." The song is about
a young woman who is a school
teacher by day, but go-go dancer
by night.
That idea of transformation
will be in full effect as these
two University faculty members
morph into versatile entertainers.

Beginning Hollywood's fairy-
tale revival is ABC's "Once Upon
A Time," which - seven episodes
in - has finally found the spark
that characterizes the classic tales
it draws from.
It's hard to discuss "Once Upon
a Time" without acknowledging
the clear influence of creators
Edward Kitsis and Adam Horow-
itz's prior work on a little show
called "Lost." There are Easter
eggs in every episode, like a clock

and MacCutcheon whiskey, not

The writers also borrow that
series' successful narrative ele-
ments, like the format: Each
episode is a character study,
unfolding in two universes -
real life and the fantasy realm.
The most engrossing part so far
is the ongoing romantic tension
between Snow White/Mary Mar-
garet (Ginnifer Goodwin, "Some-
thing Borrowed") and Prince
Charming/David (Josh Dallas,
"Thor"). Their story connects
more to the overarching plot of
fairy-tale characters defeating
an evil queen, while figures like
Jiminy Cricket/Archie (Raphael
Sbarge, "CSI") and Cinderella/
who-the-eff-are-you add little to
the storyline.
The make-believe realm in
"Once Upon A Time" is a con-
glomeration of traditional tropes.

Romney campaign launches
broad new assault on rivals

Gingrich attacked
professionally,
personally
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)
- Republican Mitt Romney
opened a broad and newly abra-
sive assault on rival Newt Gin-
grich on yesterday, dispatching
surrogates and staff to cast him
as unworthy of the GOP nomi-
nation and unfit to be president
Romney's allies also readied a
blistering new ad in Iowa that
says Gingrich has spent "30
years in Washington flip-flop-
ping on issues."
The former Massachusetts
governor is aiming to under-
mine his rising rival on both
personal and professional fronts
ahead of the 2012 campaign's
opening contest Jan. 3 in Iowa -
a reversal by the one-time front-
runner who had previously all
but ignored his Republican foes.
"He's not a reliable and trust-
ed conservative leader because
he's not a reliable or trustwor-
thy leader," former Missouri
Sen. Jim Talent, a Romney sup-
porter, said of Gingrich, offer-

ing a preview of the attacks
Romney's team promised would
continue in the next few weeks.
Romney allies, for their part,
announced a $3.1 million TV ad
campaign in Iowa beginning
Friday that includes the new
commercial assailing Gingrich
on a host of fronts.
"Newt has a ton of baggage
... And on the issues? Newt's
been on all sides," says the ad
by Restore Our Future politi-
cal action committee, which is
made up of aides of Romney's
failed 2008 campaign.
Campaigning in South Caro-
lina, Gingrich brushed off the
verbal assault and insisted his
campaign would not change
its above-the-fray approach
regarding fellow Republican
contenders.
"We're focused on remaining
positive," he said.
Gingrich's reluctance to
engage may be out of necessity.
He dramatically lags Romney
in organizational firepower as
he tries to rebuild his campaign
after an early summer implo-
sion that left it deep in debt.
The onslaught of criticism
from Romney and his allies,

after months of focusing solely
on President Barack Obama and
little on his GOP foes, comes as
the race has developed into a
two-person contest. Gingrich's
quick rise in national and early-
state polls threatens Romney's
claim as the likeliest Republi-
can to be chosen to challenge
Obama next fall.
Romney's attack strategy car-
ries risks.
If he's successful in tearing
down his main rival, there's no
guarantee that ina multi-candi-
date field he'll end up benefiting
from a possible Gingrich fall. At
the same time, congenial Iowa
voters generally don't look kind-
ly on candidates who engage in
negative politics, and they could
end up punishing Romney in a
state that already presents hur-
dles for him. Plus, questioning
Gingrich's adherence to conser-
vatism could draw attention to
Romney's own liabilities as hav-
ing switched positions on key
social issues including abortion
and gay marriage.
The candidate, himself, per-
sonally stayed out of the fray
yesterday, raising money in pri-
vate in Virginia.

During incident,
campus officials
were at a hearing on
2007 shooting
BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) - A
gunman killed a police officer in
a Virginia Tech parking lot yes-
terday and then apparently shot
himself to death nearby in a baf-
fling attack that shook up the cam-
pus nearly five years after it was
the scene of the deadliest shooting
rampage in modern U.S. history.
The shooting took place on the

same day Virginia Tech officials
were in Washington, fighting a
government fine over their alleged
mishandling of the 2007 blood-
bath where 33 people were killed.
Before it became clear that the
gunman in yesterday's attack was
dead, the school applied the les-
sons learned during the last trag-
edy, locking down the campus and
using a high-tech alert system to
warn students and faculty mem-
bers to stay indoors.
"In light of the turmoil and
trauma and the tragedy suffered
by this campus by guns, I can only
say words don't describe our feel-
ings and they're elusive at this

point in time," university presi-
dent Charles Steger said. "Our
hearts are broken again for the
family of our police officer."
The officer was killed after
pulling a driver over in a traf-
fic stop. The gunman - who was
not involved in the traffic stop -
walked into the parking lot and
ambushed the officer. Police did
not know what the motive was and
they didn't release the identity of
the officer or shooter.
A law enforcement official who
spoke on the condition of anonym-
ity confirmed the gunman was
dead, but wouldn't say how he
died.

Thompson's 16 points help
Blue hold off pesky Titans

COURTESY OF THE MICHIGAN ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT
Fifth-year senior center David Molk was named a first-team Walter Camp All American yesterday.
olk wins Ri-mington
as nation's best center

TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor

What does it take to play the
center position?
Michigan fifth-year senior
center David Molk is not the big-
gest guy - he's 6-foot-2 and just
286 pounds. Usually, it takes a
player who's two inches taller
and 40 pounds heavier to play
center.
Consistency is important. But
Molk's resolve was questioned
after his redshirt sophomore sea-
son when he missed eight games
due to foot and knee injuries. He
has started every game since,
gaining a reputation for his smart
play and nasty mean streak.
Too small and too injury prone
no more, Molk was named the
best center in the nation Thurs-
day, as he was announced the
winner of the 2011 Rimington
Trophy.
"I am truly humbled to be
the Rimj gtn Trophy repipi-
ent," Molk said in a statement.
"It's such an honor considering
all of the great centers around
the country, including the other
finalists. It's an individual award,
but it's a credit to our offensive
line, our team and our coaching
staff. I'm proud to represent the
 University of Michigan."

DETROIT - What started
as a 13-point halftime lead for
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team, and later a 19-point
lead early
in the sec- MICHIGAN 61
ond half, DETROIT 51
turned
into a nail biter at Calihan Hall
against Detroit last night.
Last season, the Titans
visited Ann Arbor and eas-
ily defeated the Wolverines,
67-48. Michigan was looking
for redemption this year - and
found it - defeating the Titans
61-St this time.
"I'm glad that we escaped
out of here with a win," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"Detroit gave us everything we
can handle"
Though Michigan won by
double digits, the Titans made
Borseth sweat.
With 12 minutes remaining
in the game, the Wolverines led
by 17 points. But the Titans went
on a 13-2 run, cutting Michi-
gan's lead to just six.
Detroit's answer was simple
- production from an unlikely
source. Though guard Senee
Shearer hadn't hit a 3-point
attempt all season, she made
five 3-pointers in the second
half after going 0-for-2 in the
first half.
"I told our kids in the huddle,
'They're making everything
that's going up in that basket,"
Borseth said. " 'If they miss you
need to rebound it and put it in
on your end of the court'."
Rebounding was one prob-
lem that arose for Michigan.
Though the Wolverines were
only outrebounded by six,
Detroit grabbed 15 offensive
rebounds compared to the Wol-
verines' six. The Titans' sec-
ond-chance points from those
rebounds allowed them to stay
in the game.
Forward Shareta Brown, who
entered the game as Detroit's
leading scoring, tallied 15 points
and 11 rebounds - five of which
came on the offensive glass.
"She's big," Borseth said. "She
just moves you. You're blocking

her out and she just moves you
and then rebounds it. I don't
really know how you stop that.
She's a handful, and she's going
to be handful for everybody that
she plays against."
Added senior guard Courtney
Boylan: "It was our emphasis
to guard (Brown) because we
know that she's their best play-
er. Butwhen (Shearer) started to
hit shots, it was harder for us to
help - which is when (Brown)
got more looks."
The Wolverines received a
big offensive performance from
junior guard Kate Thompson,
who went 6-for-12 from the field
and led the team with 16 points.
"Kate has faced a lot of zones
in high school, so when she gets
in against a zone, she really
knows how to move," Borseth
said.
Thompson was able to use
her size advantage, as a 6-foot-
4 guard, to make 3-pointers and
score inside the paint.
Borseth played Boylan less
than usual - in favor of a taller
lineup - in an attempt to stop
the Titans from penetrating
with their speed. In the second
half, Detroit penetrated and
kicked on multiple possessions,
which resulted in Shearer get-
ting open looks from behind the

arc.
"(Junior guard) Nya (Jor-
dan) had a great game when
we played against Detroit last
time," Borseth said. "Her ath-
leticism and her size and it
being Detroit, I really thought
Nya was a kid that could make
a difference (tonight). I thought
she did a great job.
"It wasn't that Courtney
wasn't doing her job. Defen-
sively, I just tried to put a bigger
guard in." .
Boylan finished with just
nine points, while only playing
23 minutes - 10 minutes less
than her season average.
"I think Coach just wanted to
throw a lot of different things
at Detroit because last year we
kind of sat back and took a beat-
ing," junior forward Rachel
Scheffer said. "This year we
came at them with a lot of dif-
ferent lineups they weren't used
to."
Last night's game may have
been a close one, but when it
came to free throws late in in
the game, the Wolverines were
flawless.
Though they shot 43 percent
for the game, theywent 6-for-6
from the charity in it's last three
possessions to clinch the vic-
tory.

Luckily for Berenson, he's got

There's something about Mich-
igan State that just seems to light
a fire under fifth-year senior net-
minder Shawn Hunwick - a fire
that burned brightest on the big-
gest stage last season.
Hunwick believed he would
be on the bench for The Big Chill
at the Big House last December.

might as well have been sealed

Beilein. Though Lucas-Perry hasn't

been shooting the ball particu-
larly well so far this season. His
ability to get into the lane off
the dribble allows him to draw
fouls and get to the line often.
He's also an above-average
rebounder whom Michigan's
guards will have to box out.
The Wolverines' main con-
cern on defense will be con-
taining fifth-year senior Reggie
Hamilton, easily the Grizzlies'
most prolific scorer with 20.1
points per game.
Last season, the 5-foot-11
point guard lit up the Wolver-
ines for 23 points.
Granted, some of Hamil-
ton's production in last season's
contest was because guards
sagged off of him to help defend
against Benson and Hudson in
the post. The numbers don't lie
- Hamilton launched a whop-
ping 14 shots from behind the
arc in that game and made all
six of his team's 3-point field
goals.
This year, Michigan's focus
will be on Hamilton. Freshman
point guard Trey Burke will
likely guard him for most of the
game, a tremendous opportu-
nity for the young stud to show
Beilein that he could be a pre:-
mier on-ball defender.
But don't be surprised if
Beilein goes to the bench fre-
quently to call on senior guard
Stu Douglass to give Burke
some rest. The co-captain has
been in a shooting slump all
season, knocking down just 28
percent of his 3-pointers so far,
but he's still considered Michi-
gan's top perimeter defender.
