CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Provost emphasizes 

importance of 
offering a broad 

array of disciplines

By TANAZ AHMED 

Daily Staff Reporter

Though LSA offers more than 

75 majors, some majors are far less 
popular than others.

According to the enrollment 

report from the Office of the Regis-
trar, as of the current winter semes-
ter the Ancient Greek, Modern 
Greek and Earth Sciences majors 
each have only have one student 
enrolled. Ancient and Modern 
Greek are offered by the Classical 
Studies Department, while Earth 
Sciences is housed in the Depart-
ment of Earth and Environmental 
Sciences.

However, Michelle Biggs, the 

undergraduate coordinator for the 
Classical Studies Department, said 
there are five students enrolled in 
the Modern Greek concentration. 
There are also 14 students majoring 
in Classical Language and Litera-
ture, seven of whom chose Greek as 
their main language.

The Classical Languages and 

Literature concentration requires 
students to study both Greek and 
Latin, but to choose one language 
as their main focus.

The differences between the 

information in the enrollment 
report and the actual number of 
students enrolled in a program 
may be due to students studying 
abroad. The report also does not 
also include students who declared 
their majors after the data for the 
report is collected.

University Provost Martha Pol-

lack said there is no specific enroll-
ment number and the University 
does not require concentration pro-
grams to retain a minimum number 
of students because it is important 
the University provide a large vari-
ety of subjects for students.

“What distinguishes us is our 

breadth of excellence,” she said.

Pollack said the cost of maintain 

each major and minor is only one of 
the factors the University takes into 
consideration. The importance of 
the major or minor in the field also 
impacts the University’s decisions.

“We are very, very concerned 

with the cost of higher education, 
but we are also concerned with 
having the breadth that makes us 
great,” Pollack said.

According to JoAnn Peraino, the 

University’s curriculum and enroll-
ment manager, low enrollment does 
not impact how majors are modified 
or how their futures are decided.

“It’s driven by pedagogy,” she 

said. “It’s about the subject, not the 
numbers.”

Periano said the University as a

Melody Barnes 
discusses people 
who lack access to 

education, jobs

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ford School of Public 

Policy ended its yearly policy 
talk series Monday with a lec-
ture from a University alum.

Melody Barnes, chair of the 

Aspen Institute’s Forum for 
Community Solutions, gave a 
lecture to aspiring policy mak-
ers, titled “Creating Oppor-
tunity for America’s Youth: 
Anatomy of a Public Policy 
Challenge.”

Barnes received her law 

degree from the University in 
1989. Prior to becoming the 
chair of the forum, Barnes 
served as an assistant to the 
president and director of the 
White House Domestic Policy 
Council from 2009 to 2012 
under President Barack Obama. 
In her opening remarks, Barnes 
said she was happy to return to 
Ann Arbor.

“I don’t think I’ve been back 

in Ann Arbor for a number of 
years,” Barnes said. “It’s terrific 
to be back. I already had a Zing-
erman’s brownie, so I’m in good 
shape.”

Barnes’ 
lecture 
focused 

on the issue of young adults 
in America who are discon-
nected with the education sys-
tem — college and high school 

dropouts — as well as those not 
interacting with the economy 
in a significant way or holding 
jobs that cannot support them 
or a family. Barnes refers to 
the estimated 6.7 to 7 million 
American 16- to 24-year-olds 
who fall into this category as 
“opportunity youth.”

Contrary to the common 

narrative, which categorizes 
these youths as disconnected 
and uninterested in engaging in 
the community, Barnes said she 
and her counterparts discov-
ered their value while engaging 
with the opportunity youth.

“I believe that, having spent 

time with many of these young 
people, that this is an untapped, 
but vital resource for our coun-
try,” she said. “They have much 
to contribute in intellectual 

gifts and in grit, and a view of 
the world that can help us solve 
many of the challenges before 
us.”

Barnes explained the impor-

tance of investing in opportu-
nity youth for both moral and 
economic causes.

During the question and 

answer period, Barnes said fail-
ing to address the challenges 
faced by opportunity youth 
costs taxpayers billions of dol-
lars — including loss of federal 
revenue to funding the juvenile 
justice system and healthcare, 
as well as loss in federal tax 
revenue.

Barnes said society’s percep-

tions of opportunity youth is 
one of the biggest roadblocks to 
finding solutions.

ADMINISTRATION

Board will also vote 

to approve $38.5 

million parking and 
transport facility

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

and GEN HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporters

The University’s Board of 

Regents will meet Thursday to 
approve the construction of a 
brand new Transportation Oper-
ation and Maintenance Facility 
project and the construction for 
a $54 million robotics laboratory 
on North Campus.

Doug Strong, the University’s 

interim chief financial officer, 
recommended constructing a new 
research and teaching facility for 
the robotics program through the 
College of Engineering.

The new building will house 

research 
laboratories, 
offices, 

classroom 
space 
and 
other 

functions.

The project will be funded in 

part through resources and gifts 
from the College of Engineering.

Strong also proposed to replace 

the current Parking Transporta-
tion Services Building with a larger 
building to accommodate heavier 

equipment and larger buses.

Though 
the 
Parking 
and 

Transportation Services Build-
ing is located currently on South 
Campus, on Kipke Drive and 
past the Yost Ice Arena, the new 
building is to be located on North 
Campus near Green Road and 
Hubbard Street.

According to Strong, the move-

ment will allow the University to 
save approximately $400,000 
per year in operating expenses 
by reducing miles out of service 
buses travel to get to the farther 
location. Furthermore, the new 
facility would allow about 185 
parking spaces to become avail-
able on the Stephen M. Ross Ath-
letic Campus.

The new site is estimated to 

cost $38.5 million and construc-
tion is set to begin in fall 2017.

Construction proposals

The regents will also consider a 

variety of construction proposals.

The North Quadrangle Resi-

dential and Academic Complex, 
which opened in 2010, is in need 
of a new roof. An investigation is 
underway to determine the cause 
of the roof’s premature deteriora-
tion. The proposal recommends 
replacing approximately 25,000 
square feet of the metal roofing 
on the building’s south wing. 

Committee also adds 

new guidelines for 
faculty grievance 

procedures

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

The Senate Advisory Commit-

tee on University Affairs convened 
Monday afternoon for their sec-
ond-to-last meeting before newly 
elected members take office on 
May 1. The committee reviewed 
the Statement of Student Rights 
and Responsibilities and adopted 
an edited version of the SACUA 
Guidance on Grievability.

SACUA member David Potter, 

a Classical Studies professor, dis-
cussed two main takeaways from 
attending a recent luncheon spon-
sored by the University’s Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution.

He noted the types of statement 

violations reported to the Univer-
sity and the potential of adding an 
additional honor code to supple-
ment the statement.

Potter said 600 statement viola-

tions were reported within the last 
year, and the University issued no 
expulsions or suspensions during

Sigma Delta Tau 
kicks off “Speak 
Up! Michigan” 

initiative

By EMMA KILBANE

Daily Staff Reporter

After the University placed 

its chapter of the Sigma Delta 
Tau sorority on a two-year 
disciplinary suspension for 
attending a January ski trip 

that resulted in thousands of 
dollars in damage, the sorority 
is launching a bystander inter-
vention program.

The 
newly 
implemented 

Speak Up! Michigan program 
kicked off Monday evening 
with a lecture by Mike Dil-
beck, who founded Response 
Ability, a program providing 
people with the tools to inter-
vene in difficult situations. 
SDT organized the initiative 
to promote bystander inter-
vention education on campus.

The audience was mostly 

composed of students affiliat-
ed with Greek life. SDT mem-
bers made up a majority of the 
audience.

Michelle 
Carlson, 
SDT 

national 
president, 
also 

attended, and referenced the 
chapter’s current disciplinary 
suspension. Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones sanctioned 
the chapter in February upon 
the conclusion of the Univer-
sity’s disciplinary proceedings.

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Hockey player Tyler Motte plays air hockey with a

event in the Michigan Union on Monday.

OFF THE ICE

Public Policy senior Maya 

Menlo is Ann Arbor Inter-Coop-
erative Council president and a 
board member for North Ameri-
can Students of Cooperation.

What prompted your involve-
ment in a co-op living situa-

tion?

I think that after living in 

the dorms and not necessarily 
getting the sense of community 
that I wanted out of my college 
situation. The real reason that I 
was ever involved in the co-op 
was that I had a friend from a 
class of mine, and she asked me 
to dinner while she was living 
at Gregory House on Washt-
enaw Avenue. There were a lot 

of people in a cozy atmosphere.

How long have you lived in 

the co-op?

Sophomore year I moved 

into Benjamin on Catherine 
Street, 2012-2013. I’ve been 
there three years now. The 
people who live there are 
my friends and my family.

How does living in a co-op 

differ from traditional dorm 
life or living in a fraternity or 

sorority house?

Well, the biggest thing about 

the co-op is it’s an intentional 
community. The shared set 
of values has always been key 

for me. I think its safe to say 
it’s not for everybody, but it is 
for a lot of people and differ-
ent types of people, as well. 

What responsibilities have 
you taken on as president of 

your co-op?

There’s a laundry list. The 

most visible duties are chair-
ing the board of directors and 
the 
executive 
community, 

which we call our coordinat-
ing committee. I also oversee 
hiring and firing processes for 
our full-time staff. emergency 
situations and contract issues.

Celebration on Ingalls Mall on Monday.
LSA student government 
hosts Senior Celebration

Inaugural event 
marks final send 
off for graduating 

liberal arts students

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

LSA Student Government cel-

ebrated seniors on Ingalls Mall 
Monday morning with free food, 
games on the Diag and a speech 
by Golden Apple-winning Sta-
tistics Lecturer Brenda Gunder-
son.

Designed to honor graduat-

ing LSA seniors, the event also 
provided resources as they tran-
sition into their new roles as 
alums. LSA’s marketing depart-
ment also provided resources 
detailing how to join the Dean’s 
Young Alumni Council and stay 
connected to LSA after gradua-
tion.

LSA senior Corey Walsh, 

event organizer and former LSA 
Student Government vice presi-
dent, said the event was created 
to instill the value of liberal arts 
degrees in graduating seniors 
one last time.

“We just thought it was 

important 
that 
seniors, 
as 

they’re exiting the University, 
have some type of large-scale 
capstone event to leave seniors 
feeling some sort of unity with 
the college of LSA, so that 
whenever they graduate they 
can become active alumni,” he 
said.

The idea for Senior Celebra-

tion began last summer, but all 
of the details were put into place 
over the past two months.

LSA junior Jason Colella, LSA 

Student Government president 
said there have been various 
attempts to hold a senior cel-
ebration in the past that never 
seemed to catch on.

“We are sort of trying to 

revive it, restart it, to really fos-
ter a sense of LSA pride,” Colella 
said.

He added that other students 

tend to feel more attached to 
their colleges after graduating, 
which he said isn’t necessarily 
the case with LSA alumni.

Gunderson said the decision 

to present a speech for gradu-
ating LSA seniors was an easy 
one.

“Being able to congratulate 

them and send them off and tell 

them they’re already amazing 
and they’ll continue to be, how 
could I not have an opportunity 
to say that?” she said.

Gunderson said she hopes 

graduates realize they won’t be 
alone, and that they will have 
access to a wide array of alumni 
resources.

She 
also 
emphasized 
the 

importance of the LSA commu-
nity to the college experience.

“You are not just handed 

knowledge,” Gunderson said. 
“You work with lots of other 
people and created that knowl-
edge.”

Furthermore, she said the 

seniors’ LSA educations have 
provided various ways to think 
and observe the world, which 
will enable them to solve com-
plex problems in real-life situ-
ations, no matter where they 
go or what career path they 
take.

LSA senior Sarah Lopez said 

the senior celebration was a 
good way to recognize the senior 
class’s achievements.

“It’s a nice reward for being a 

senior and celebratory prepar-
ing for graduation a few weeks 
away,” she said.

Senator touts ‘A 
New American 
Century’ during 
campaign kickoff

MIAMI (AP) — Sen. Marco 

Rubio entered the presidential 
race Monday by offering the 
nation a younger generation of 
leadership that breaks free of 
ideas “stuck in the 20th century,” 
a jab at both Democratic favorite 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and his 
one-time Republican mentor, 
former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Standing in front of a banner 

that proclaimed “A New Amer-
ican Century” and repeating 
that refrain throughout his 
kickoff speech, the 43-year-old 
Cuban-American used his first 
turn as a Republican presiden-
tial candidate to take on two of 

America’s political dynasties. 
In doing so, he bet heavily on 
the 
electorate’s 
frustrations 

with Washington and his abil-
ity to change how his party is 
seen by voters.

“This election is not just about 

what laws we are going to pass,” 
Rubio told his evening rally. “It is 
a generational choice about what 
kind of country we will be.”

He said it’s also a choice 

between the haves and have-
nots, nodding to his own 
upbringing by working-class 
parents. “I live an exceptional 
country where the son of a 
bartender and a maid can have 
the same dreams and the same 
future as those who come from 
power and privilege.”

Earlier in the day, the first-

term Republican from Florida 
spoke to his top donors and told 
them many families feel the 
American Dream is slipping 

away and young Americans 
face 
unequal 
opportunities. 

He’s banking on the hope that 
he, alone among many GOP 
rivals, can make inroads with 
groups that have long eluded 
Republicans — young people, 
minorities and the less affluent.

“I feel uniquely qualified to 

not just make that argument, but 
to outline the policies that we 
need to have in order to achieve 
it,” he said on the donor call.

In his televised speech, he 

told supporters, “The time has 
come for our generation to lead 
the way toward a new American 
century.”

Rubio’s remarks came as 

Clinton was traveling to Iowa 
on her first trip as a candidate. 
Her entrance into the race with 
an online video Sunday is rob-
bing some attention from Rubio’s 
splash into the race.

But Rubio saw an opportuni-

ty to cast the presidential con-
test as one between a fresh face 
representing a new generation 
of leadership and familiar faces 
harking back decades — name-
ly, the 62-year-old Bush and the 
67-year-old Clinton.

“While our people and econ-

omy are pushing the boundaries 
of the 21st century, too many of 
our leaders and their ideas are 
stuck in the 20th century,” Rubio 
said to applause.

The swipe at Bush was 

implied; with Clinton, he was 
more direct.

“Just yesterday, a leader from 

yesterday began a campaign for 
president by promising to take us 
back to yesterday,” Rubio said to 
jeers. “Yesterday is over and we 
are never going back.”

Supporters began lining up 

in 87-degree heat three hours 
before the public kickoff at 
Freedom Tower, the Miami 
landmark that was the first stop 
for tens of thousands of fleeing 
Cuban exiles during the 1960s 
and 1970s.

that time. He added that of the 
129 reported sexual misconduct 
cases, 68 of which were classified 
as sexual assault and 34 as sexual 
harassment. There were 14 cases 
of stalking, 11 violations for other 
matters and two for retaliation.

“There 
were 
a 
significant 

amount of cases that were report-
ed where the survivor did not 
wish to pursue matters further,” 
Potter said.

The second item of note — the 

creation of an honor code — is 
also under consideration by Cen-
tral Student Government. In 
February, CSG President Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, 
commissioned a task force to 
consider writing an honor code, 
which would cover topics such as 
academic integrity and student 
rights.

“The aim of the task force, and 

eventually the honor code, will be 
to encourage and motivate stu-
dents to hold ourselves to a higher 
standard,” Dishell wrote in a Feb-
ruary press release. “Currently 
there is not one place where stu-
dents can turn to in order to know 
what our community stands for. 
It’s important that, as students 
at Michigan, we understand our 
roles as the leaders and best both 
on and off campus.”

At the luncheon, Potter said 

attendees suggested that any new 
honor code also provide proce-
dures for handling violations of 
the code.

He also noted the strength in a 

single Statement of Student Rights 
and Responsibilities governing all 
of the University’s schools and col-
leges. At the luncheon, Potter said 
OSCR officials clarified that it is 
important to maintain this con-
sistency. Though all units are gov-
erned by the current Statement 
of Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities, not all have honor codes 
that provide clear expectations of 
behavior for members of the Uni-
versity community.

The body also adopted a new 

SACUA Guidance on Grievabil-
ity, which is designed to provide 
resources for faculty filing a com-
plaint through the University’s 
grievance procedures.

After 
reviewing 
the 
final 

guidance, SACUA member John 
Lehman, a professor of biology, 
made a motion to adopt the docu-
ment and revisit it annually. The 
motion was passed unanimously.

“If the hearing board decides 

that the complaint is not griev-
able, the grievant can appeal 
the decision to SACUA,” SACUA 
Chair Scott Masten, a professor 
of business economics and public 
policy, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view after the meeting. “After 
receiving such an appeal last fall 
and overruling the grievance 
board, we decided that it would 
be useful if grievance boards had 
a document that explained how 
we interpret the grievance pro-
cedures so that they would be less 
likely to make an error. The docu-
ment that we approved today is 
that document.”

During the meeting, Masten 

said he plans to give an update on 
SACUA’s report on the Universi-
ty’s Office of Institutional Equity 
when the full Senate Assembly 
meets next week. Masten said 
the decision making process will 
carry over into May because of 
the provost’s schedule.

A report filed by SACUA last 

month pointed to several flaws 
SACUA found within OIE. The 
report’s central concerns were 
the adequacy of due process pro-
tections in OIE procedures and 
OIE’s application of those proce-
dures in the specific cases of three 
faculty members who submitted 
complaints to SACUA.

The last SACUA meeting of the 

2014-2015 academic year is sched-
uled for April 27.

whole also does not attempt 
to increase enrollment for 
specific majors. Rather, she 
said, it is the department’s 
responsibility 
to 
market 

their majors through their 
course listings and presence 
at the Major/Minor Expo.

Biggs said many students 

do not enroll in the Ancient 
Greek or Modern Greek pro-
grams because the majors 
are difficult and the lan-
guage is not usually taught 
at high schools. She also said 
students often do not rec-
ognize the versatility of the 
programs.

“It’s a good preparation 

for things not just in aca-
demia,” Biggs said.

Though the number of 

students majoring in the 
programs is low, the depart-
ments are not impacted 
financially 
since 
Greek 

classes 
offered 
by 
the 

department are filled with 
graduate students as well 
as non-majors, according to 
Biggs.

LSA senior Joseph Jozlin 

said he chose to study Mod-
ern Greek because of the 
major’s lack of popularity 
with most students.

“Most people study lan-

guages like Spanish and Chi-
nese,” Jozlin said. “I wanted 
to do something different.”

LSA junior Constantinos 

Demetral said he decided 
to major in Modern Greek 
because it allows him to con-

nect to his cultural roots. He 
also chose to study the sub-
ject because of the quality of 
the department and its pro-
fessors.

“I am Greek and I’ve 

always wanted to brush up 
on my Greek,” Demetral said. 
“There are also great profes-
sors who are willing to help 
and the department is very 
supportive.”

Demetral also cited the 

difficulty of the upper-level 
classes as a reason for why 
students may not want to 
pursue a major in Modern 
Greek.

“The 300-level classes are 

very hard and the grammar 
is very difficult; it’s noth-
ing like English grammar,” 
Demetral said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Jonas 

Sese 
initially 
considered 

majoring in Ancient Greek 
but later chose to major in 
Classical 
Languages 
and 

Literature instead because 
he wanted to study both 
Ancient Greek and Latin.

Sese 
said 
he 
believes 

the low enrollment in the 
Ancient Greek program is 
due to more students turn-
ing to science, technology, 
engineering and mathemat-
ics majors.

“I think it has to do with 

the shift of focus in univer-
sities from the humanities 
to STEM fields,” Sese said. 
“Ancient Greek is as far into 
the humanities as you can 
get. I think a lot of people 
entering into university want 
a major that has a lot of prac-
tical applications.”

The project, which is estimat-
ed to cost $3.2 million, will be 
funded by internal investment 
proceeds and is scheduled for 
completion in fall 2015.

The board will also consider 

a budget revision for the Earl V. 
Moore Building renovation and 
Brehm Pavillion project. The 
project, which was approved 
by the Board in December 2013, 
was initially estimated to cost 
$24.32 million. According to 
the original proposal, approxi-
mately 28,000 square feet of the 
existing building will be reno-
vated and 34,000 square feet of 
shelled space will be added.

The 
proposal 
asks 
the 

regents to increase the budget 
to $29.5 million to allow for a 
music technology room, a stu-
dent commons room and mis-
cellaneous furnishings.

Central Student 

Government in review
CSG 
president 
Bobby 

Dishell, a Public Policy senior, 
will give his final address to 
the board — a portion of which 
will focus on the pending, CSG-
generated student honor code.

In February, Dishell created 

a student task force charged 
with designing the central-
ized student honor code — and 
Thursday, he will report on its 
progress.

The honor code follow-up 

comes as the Office of Student 
Life reviews the Statement of 
Student Rights and Respon-
sibilities as part of its regular 
amendment cycle.

In an e-mail to the Univer-

sity community on April 9, E. 
Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, announced the 
statement was up for revisions 
and noted that CSG, the Senate 

Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs, and the Uni-
versity’s administration are the 
three bodies that can propose 
amendments.

On 
this 
subject, 
Dishell 

wrote, “Currently, there is no 
student ownership or input 
over the process and rules that 
govern student behavior and 
hold students accountable.”

Subsequently, he said, the 

honor code is to work parallel 
to the Statement.

“I encourage students to 

work with the administration, 
take the honor pledge, and 
hold each other and ourselves 
accountable,” Dishell wrote in 
his report.

In a February interview with 

the Daily, Harper said she felt 
that the potential of an addi-
tional academic honor code 
could have significant overlap 
and even clash with the exist-
ing Statement. However, she 
agreed it would be beneficial to 
hold students accountable for 
their behavior in a more rigid 
and well-known way.

“What I think is fabulous 

about it is, I think having the 
conversation about that (is 
important),” 
Harper 
said. 

“What does it mean in our 
community to have an honor 
code? What does it mean to be 
honorable? And then, what do 
you do about it when someone 
is behaving in a dishonorable 
way?”

Dishell will also speak to the 

board about the need for a con-
tinued focus on mental health, 
a topic which he discussed on 
a personal level at last month’s 
meeting.

CSG has emphasized the 

need for improved mental 
health facilities on campus; this 
year’s efforts have included the 
launch of Wolverine Support 
Network in September.

ROCKWOOD, Mich.
New partnership 
seeks to improve 
habitats for ducks 

A partnership is working to 

improve the habitat for ducks at 
Pointe Mouillee State Game Area 
in southeastern Michigan.

The state Department of Natu-

ral Resources says a group of vol-
unteers recently participated in 
the On the Ground project. They 
worked the DNR staff to install 10 
new nesting structures for mal-
lards and cleaned and maintained 
20 existing mallard nest struc-
tures.

The work took place in the 

game area’s Vermet, Humphries 
and Long Pond units.

They 
also 
spread 
cattail 

seed heads in the Vermet Unit to 
increase cover for ducks. And they 
cleaned and maintained 30 wood 
duck nest boxes.

Volunteers came from a number 

of groups. The project is part of a 
partnership between the DNR and 
Michigan United Conservation 
Clubs to improve fish and wildlife 
habitat.

Man arrested after 
Megabus crash

A Megabus bringing passen-

gers back to Chicago after anoth-
er bus was involved in a crash 
was stopped by Indiana State 
Police so a passenger wanted on a 
warrant out of Michigan could be 
arrested.

Trooper John Perrine says the 

arrest was made without incident 
shortly before noon Monday. He 
didn’t know what the man was 
charged with or how Michigan 
authorities knew he was on the 
bus.

Perrine says the man was not 

among the 19 passengers injured 
when the other Megabus crashed 
about 5:30 a.m. Monday in Johnson 
County near Edinburgh.

The second bus was allowed 

to continue to Chicago after the 
arrest.

Storm clouds stall 
space grocery run

SpaceX will have to wait anoth-

er day to deliver groceries and an 
espresso maker to the Internation-
al Space Station.

Fast-approaching storm clouds 

prevented the unmanned rocket 
from blasting off Monday after-
noon. The company will try again 
Tuesday afternoon, but more bad 
weather is forecast. The odds of 
acceptable conditions are just 
50-50.

SpaceX halted the countdown at 

the 2½-minute mark as a menac-
ing storm system moved into the 
11-mile keep-out zone surrounding 
the Falcon rocket. The company 
had a single second to get off the 
ground.

“We were in a race, but we didn’t 

quite make it today,” a SpaceX 
launch commentator said.

China releases five 
women activists

Chinese 
authorities 
released 

five women’s rights campaigners 
Monday whose detentions sparked 
an international outcry and under-
scored the government’s tight 
restrictions on independent social 
activism, lawyers said.

Lawyer Liang Xiaojun said the 

five were let go after more than a 
month in detention under a form 
of conditional release that still 
allows charges to be brought later. 
As of late Monday night, all had 
either returned or were on their 
way to their homes in Beijing and 
elsewhere in China, including the 
southern metropolis of Guangzhou 
and the eastern resort city of Hang-
zhou.

Other lawyers could not be 

reached by phone, but posted mes-
sages on social media saying their 
clients had been freed. Calls to the 
Haidian District Detention Center 
in western Beijing where they had 
been held rang unanswered Mon-
day night.

training necessary to step in 
and make a difference,” Carlson 
said. “They want to empower 
other students on this campus 
to step in and make a difference 
when situations happen. They 
were faced with a situation 
where they felt like they didn’t 
have the tools yet.”

The 
University’s 
state-

ment deemed SDT’s members 
bystanders during a trip where 
members of the Sigma Alpha 
Mu fraternity committed more 
than $250,000 in property 
damage to a Gaylord ski resort.

“Members of the Sigma Delta 

Tau sorority stood by at Treetops 
Resort and allowed others to 
vandalize the facility,” the Uni-
versity’s statement read. “This 

lack of action is unacceptable.”

The discussion began with 

the recitation of a 20-line creed, 
which began and ended with 
the words, “I am courageous 
leadership.” Courageous lead-
ership was defined by Dilbeck 
as going beyond fear and stand-
ing up, stepping in and speaking 
out against the injustice present 
on campus and in the everyday 
lives of people everywhere.

Dilbeck also shared a person-

al story of his experience found-
ing the Sigma Nu fraternity at 
Texas 
Christian 
University, 

a chapter that was ultimately 
shut down in 2002. During 
his speech, Dilbeck discussed 
recalled his own failure to 
intervene in several situations.

“I am deeply ashamed for 

what I didn’t do,” he said.

LSA sophomore Allie Lisner, 

a member of the SDT executive 
board, said SDT members have 

met with the Dean of Students to 
discuss implementing a bystand-
er intervention program on cam-
pus. She said the sorority hopes 
to provide programs and spark 
conversation about speaking up 
in difficult situations.

“There’s 
nothing 
for 
if 

you’re in a disaster or this cri-
ses when someone is damag-
ing something, like how could 
you intervene?” Lisner said. 
“People 
should 
learn 
this 

when they come to Michigan 
or when they join Greek life or 
any other organization rather 
than after they’ve already made 
the mistake of not being the 
best bystander they could have 
been.”

Dilbeck invited students to 

anonymously text his iPod on 
stage with their own stories 
about difficult situations they 
had been in. He read a few of 
the stories submitted by stu-

dents from other campuses as 
well, some of which addressed 
hazing and discrimination.

Lisner said SDT is looking 

to include the entire campus 
community in the Speak Up! 
Michigan program and not just 
members of Greek life.

“Bystander intervention is 

important in any setting across 
this country,” Delbick said. “We 
have such an opportunity to 
empower the people who are 
not standing up to the wrong of 
the world.”

LSA 
freshman 
Maggie 

Brockmeyer-Bernard 
com-

mented on the importance of 
continuing education on the 
topic.

“We are constantly put in 

situations where it is useful so 
it’s really good to be educated 
on this type of thing.”

“Included in this is a specific 

focus on perception change,” 
Barnes said. “In many ways it 
is the thorniest and knottiest of 
all of the problems that we have, 
and it sits at the base of so many 
of the other challenges that 
we’re trying to address.”

The Aspen Institute launched 

an advertising campaign to 
attempt to target this challenge, 
according to Barnes. During the 
lecture, Barnes showed a com-
mercial in which a girl explains 
to her interviewer the skills she 
has gained and can contribute to 
her job despite the fact that she 
has not attained a college degree.

“This is one of the things that 

I see over and over and over 
again,” Barnes said. “People are 
willing to believe that there’s 
that one exceptional person 
… But 6,000,000 exceptional 

people? Society seems to be 
unwilling to believe that that’s 
possible, but it is.”

For example, Barnes recalled 

working with Obama to rep-
licate an educational achieve-
ment model employed by the 
non-profit organization Strive 
Together. The Strive Network 
found graduation rates were 
dropping in the region and 
worked with other public and 
private institutions to create a 
network to solve the problem.

“Then they decided, ulti-

mately, to take their work and 
say we’re not just going to do 
that here,” Barnes said. “But we 
can replicate this all over the 
country, and now that work is 
taking place in over 34 different 
cities and the District of Colum-
bia. We’re seeing that kind of 
progress everywhere we turn.”

The Aspen Institute works in 

conjunction with the collective 
impact of the federal govern-
ment and private institutions. 

They work to create a collabora-
tive effort by having members 
of companies and philanthropic 
organizations to ensure that all 
parties are working together 
and not just providing funding. 
In addition, they include the 
opportunity youth in the panels.

“You have to bring the very 

people in the communities that 
you want to work with to the 
table to understand what the 
challenge of the problems is so 
you can understand that you 
can go about with their support 
and their assistance with them 
as partners to actually fix it,” 
she said. “Who’s a better expert 
on the life of an opportunity 
youth here than an opportunity 
youth?”

She said the Aspen Institute 

ultimately wants to create a 
nationwide network between 
government, 
philanthropic 

organizations, private business-
es and opportunity youth.

“To create a learning com-

munity, to create a hub, where 
communities that are doing this 
work can talk to one another,” 
Barnes said. “What we have 
found is that literally commu-
nities 50 miles apart, 100 miles 
apart, didn’t know what they 
were doing, and, as a result of 
that, communities were mak-
ing the same mistakes over and 
over. We could leap all part 
that if people are talking to one 
another.”

Barnes concluded her discus-

sion by highlighting the potential 
for students to make a lasting 
impact on the community.

“We can have the kind of suc-

cess that we want and that we 
need,” she said. “We can solve 
these problems if we work col-
laboratively, and with the ben-
efit of the kind of education that 
many of you are getting here 
today, you will be the initial fuel 
in each of those sectors to make 
sure that get it.”

A

ttending the Boston Mara-
thon has been an annual 
tradition ever since my par-

ents 
emigrated 

from 
China 
to 

Massachusetts. 
They only knew 
fragmented Eng-
lish 
then, 
but 

they waved from 
Copley Square as 
the 
international 

parade raced by.

So, as a Bos-

tonian born and 
raised, I grew up 
with Marathon Mondays. Almost 
exactly two years ago, on April 15 
of my senior year of high school, my 
dad took me into the city as per tra-
dition. We bought 7-Eleven Slurpees 
and street-vendor hot dogs at Ken-
more Square, then we made it down 
Boylston Street, where we bumped 
into friends — some volunteering 
near the finish line; some cheering 
competing family members on; oth-
ers like me, just spectating. It was 
about 2 p.m. when we decided to head 
out early to move our car before traf-
fic got wicked bad. About 49 minutes 
later, we were on the highway home 
when two bombs went off at the very 
spots we just stood.

We all returned to school the 

next week struck by events that 
still seemed surreal. Our peers 
who stood at the finish line were 
still recovering from psychologi-
cal trauma. Our middle school 
principal’s family was in critical 
condition at Mass General. There 
are others that were hit closer 
than most of us. Dzhokhar Tsar-
naev, at just 19 years old, tore apart 
our city, killing three and injuring 
 

countless others.

This past Wednesday, the fed-

eral court unsurprisingly convicted 
Tsarnaev on all 30 counts for his 
involvement in the Boston bomb-
ings. On April 21, the same seven-
woman, five-man jury team must 
unanimously decide whether to 
sentence Tsarnaev to death. They 
 

absolutely shouldn’t.

Last week, the Boston Globe 

released its editorial stance against 

a death sentence for Tsarnaev. Mas-
sachusetts Senator Elizabeth War-
ren also declared opposition to 
execution in a CBS news interview. 
Capital punishment has been abol-
ished for almost 60 years in the state 
of Massachusetts, but many Boston 
politicians, including current Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, sup-
port the death penalty in Tsarnaev’s 
case of terrorism.

Regardless of these varied views 

on the case, the primary goal of the 
government is to protect the safety 
and well-being of its citizens. Ulti-
mately, imprisoning harmful trans-
gressors achieves this purpose just 
as sufficiently. Even mass bombers 
like Tsarnaev cease to be physical 
threats when locked up for life. For 
a country that 
has been hurt 
time and again 
by 
terrorist 

actions, we will 
not 
ameliorate 

any tensions by 
using the same 
violence for ven-
geance. 
Adopt-

ing 
the 
same 

hateful terrorist 
mentality is a 
hypocritical — not an ethical — way 
to conduct a country’s legal system. 
Murder will never be moral — out 
of terrorism or out of revenge — by 
bomb or by lethal injection.

One year ago, when the massacre 

was especially fresh, a Boston Globe 
poll found approximately 29 percent 
of Boston voted against the death 
penalty for Tsarnaev and 62 percent 
voted in support of it. Months later, 
with some time from the immedia-
cy of the event, Boston’s NPR news 
station, WBUR, polled 49 percent 
against capital punishment for Tsar-
naev and 38 percent for it — a notable 
reduction in capital punishment sup-
port. Likewise, we cannot decide 
rashly from the heat of our anger 
and passion, as Tsarnaev did two 
years ago on this very day. We must 
allow our rationality to override our 
impulses to handle this case with 
careful contemplation.

I am now 19, just as Tsarnaev was 

that day. I reflect back on all the 
hasty, careless decisions I made two 
years ago — even two days ago. I like 
to call myself an adult, capable of tak-
ing responsibility for my actions and 
my wrongs, but sometimes I am too 
immature to do just that. This is not 
to allow Tsarnaev’s youthful igno-
rance to serve as a safety net; without 
parole in prison, he will never receive 
any second chances. However, the 
solution for incorrigible young indi-
viduals is not to annihilate them 
from existence, but rather, to teach 
them a hard lesson.

At the time, Tsarnaev was more of 

a teenage boy than any sort of man. 
We must teach him what he may not 
have learned in his own childhood: 
two wrongs don’t make a right. A 

lifetime in pris-
on should be an 
opportunity for 
him to regret 
his actions and 
emotionally 
realize the dam-
age he imparted. 
A life sentence 
is not “sparing” 
him out of sym-
pathy — it’s a 
sentence instead 

of a quick end to societal shame 
and disgrace. More importantly, 
it’s to remind us of how we banded 
together as a community to find 
and convict him — then, how we 
had the morality not to perpetuate 
 

his wrongs.

A part of me is angry. I want him 

in prison so he can fester in regret 
and self-pity for the rest of his exis-
tence. But, the other part of me wants 
him to have, wishes him to have, the 
opportunity to repent later in his life 
when he can fully realize his terribly 
hurtful ways. I am a Bostonian speak-
ing: He hurt my city and my commu-
nity, but that does not make it right 
to execute him as a result. Just five 
days before this year’s marathon, we 
must remember that life in prison is 
not a mitigation of punishment — it’s 
 

just morality.

“Boston Strong” does not mean death

KAREN 
HUA

I am a senior here at the University, and 

next year I’ll be attending graduate school 
here as well. Today I am going to tell you a 
little bit about my experience as a working-
class, work-study student.

Over the last four years, I have held a 

few different jobs, including working at the 
campus dining halls, daycare and babysitting 
services, Briarwood Mall in retail, McDonalds 
and Coldstone. I am currently an employee at 
University Health Services, making $9.75 an 
hour as an assistant in human resources.

I didn’t continue in my previous positions 

for various reasons, but they all had a few 
things in common:

None of my former employers offered me 

any kind of health insurance. My schedule 
was not consistent.

There was little to no opportunity for career 

advancement. No one paid over $10 per hour. 
There were always unresolved issues between 
employees and management. There was no 
sympathy for life as a student. None of these are 
jobs that look really exceptional on my resume.

But 
without 
experience, 
extra 
time 

or connections, it isn’t easy to find an 
opportunity that doesn’t fall under this 
umbrella of occupations.

Being a first-generation student from a 

low-income family, it’s a necessity that I work 
while going through school. I don’t have the 
option to do only one. But the rigor of our 
academics and the commitment needed to 
advance in the workplace are constantly 
working against each other in my life. Even 
now, I only work 15 hours a week, 20 on a 
good week — this in combination with my 
school schedule, and homework is very tiring. 
Especially now, when I’m trying to prepare 
myself for graduation and graduate school.

For the most part, my income alone has not 

been sufficient in meeting my basic needs. 
I have made up for the difference in loans 
from the University and favors from family 
members who cannot really afford to help 
me. I have tried my best to cut all financial 
corners over the years, (I’ve never had a car, 
I have lived in Ypsilanti since sophomore year 
for cheaper rent, had food stamps and state 
health insurance at one point, and lived with 
roommates), but all of these solutions were 
short-term, and ultimately the problem lies in 
the lack of support I am receiving from my job.

Though the University has been helpful 

in providing what resources it can, its help 
mostly consists of loans, which will benefit 
them more in the long-term than me. Raising 
the minimum wage to $15 an hour would 
allow me more time to focus on my studies 
while still receiving a sufficient income. It 
would also save me somewhat from drowning 
myself in more student loan debt later.

A current issue I am facing as a work-study 

student is requesting a higher pay grade once 
I begin graduate school. Even though I’ll have 
a degree from one of the best institutions in 
the country, my pay will increase by just 25 
to 75 cents from the $9.75 I am making right 

now. How can the University expect other 
businesses to pay and treat us properly when 
they don’t always follow suit?

I have worked at my job for two years, 

going into my third, and with my family’s 
income and my position as a full-time 
graduate student, I think I should be paid at 
least $14. There are other graduate students 
on this campus who make that amount, if 
not more. The University needs to take a 
greater responsibility for making wages for 
student workers more consistent. Getting 
paid a higher wage is something I think about 
often, but with the University monopolizing 
my time, I feel silly applying for jobs that can 
give me the support I need. I need health 
insurance, or at least sick days. I need a 
higher wage. But I also need a professional 
community that understands my position as 
a student, and how big of an accomplishment 
school is for me and my family.

I know my story is unique, but there are 

many other first-generation, low-income, 
over-worked and underpaid students on our 
campus. Seek them out and listen to their 
stories because they matter. This problem is a 
real one. And it’s also something I didn’t think 
I could complain about until involving myself 
with the U of M Fight for $15 campaign.

As students, we have to remember that 

this is our campus. We put all of our time and 
energy into the University. Some of us spend 
literally everything, and I mean everything, 
that we have to be here and even promise to 
pay back loans we may never have the income 
to afford. That’s a scary reality, but we also 
have the power to change the structures that 
determine how we live. It’s going to take 
mobilizing students like myself, and more 
resourceful students who can empathize 
with us, to get the ball rolling.

This issue is important because no student 

should have to choose between supporting 
themselves right now and preparing to 
support themselves long-term. That in itself 
is contradictory. Though this may not be 
a problem the average Michigan student 
faces (because most have financial support), 
it’s a problem across college campuses 
and for workers everywhere. Starting an 
undergraduate workers’ association and 
raising the minimum wage for all University 
employees, both directly employed and 
subcontracted through University Unions 
and Catering, is the first step in the fight for a 
living wage in Washtenaw County and across 
the state. We could be innovators in creating a 
space where student workers have a voice and 
are initiators of the next big labor movement.

Join us on Wednesday, April 15, at noon in 

front of South Quad for a rally on campus and 
at 3:45 p.m. at the Cube to support Detroit 
fast-food workers in their fight for a living 
wage and the right to unionize. For more 
information and to get involved, please visit

KALYN SANDERFER | VIEWPOINT

The fight for $15

I

n college, I have heard many 
stories like the Daily’s investiga-
tional article last week into the 

University’s poli-
cies for respond-
ing to reports of 
sexual 
assault. 

These stories are 
usually 
framed 

as tales of “crazy 
parties” 
leading 

to all manner of 
wild, often public, 
sexual escapades 
that 
men 
laud 

each 
other 
for. 

The issue of women (or men) actually 
wanting to partake is never brought 
up, the word “consent” being little 
more than a presumption.

I have heard these stories, and I 

have felt equal levels of confusion 
and disgust. I can’t explain why men 
rape women, as much as I wish I 
could. I also can’t explain why people 
in these stories I have heard wanted 
to partake in loveless, public acts of 
(presumably) consensual sex. But as 
I have sat and heard these kinds of 
wild party stories, my confusion and 
disgust has been tinged with a dull 
ache of jealousy.

As much as it makes me ashamed 

to admit it, that jealousy is some-
thing I might be able to explain.

***

I was a boy once, a boy who had 

few friends and many gnawing inse-
curities. I wasn’t athletic, being that 
dreaded last-picked kid when we 
made teams. For similar reasons, I 
knew that girls were not interested 
in me, and I grew to hate my body 
and the way I looked. I had good 
parents, but my father was emotion-
ally distant while my mother’s feel-
ings swung between intense love and 
intense spite. My sister was the epit-
ome of perfection I could never be, 
and while I loved her dearly, I knew 
that anything I did was immediately 
compared to the absurd precedent 
that she set.

I spent a lot of my time alone; 

drawing, reading, daydreaming, con-
templating. I would imagine what 
it would be like to one day have all 
these things I was lacking, to be 
popular among boys and sought after 
by girls. But these were only dreams, 
and the continued difficulty of reality 
led me to be deeply depressed. Over 
time, my depression spilled over into 

bitterness and, at times, uncontrol-
lable rage.

As I got older, the concept of 

being a man was largely shaped by 
these emotions. Some of the feel-
ings I experienced translated into 
important pieces of my personality, 
especially empathy and sympathy 
for the pain of others. Some of these 
feelings have only led to more pain. 
As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote: “Part 
of any adult’s maturation must be 
keeping the idiot in them under 
wraps. But I can’t kill the boy. Nor 
should I … The boy reinforces the 
man. But he needs guardrails.”

My guardrails have taken time to 

build, and on plenty of occasions over 
the last four years, they have melted 
away completely. The boy comes 
out, seeing the world in black and 
white, following his most extreme 
feelings into the abyss. He wants to 
impress people, he wants everyone 
to like him and he wants women to 
 

want him.

The man in me knows that out-

posturing men and sleeping with 
women will not fill the craters in my 
heart. The man in me also knows 
that these craters, even the ones cre-
ated by my father’s early death, do 
not have to define 
me. But the boy 
is blinded by his 
fear, his depres-
sion and his anger.

My guardrails 

are much firmer 
than they once 
were, but they are 
still finding their 
place. I have made 
terrible mistakes 
while I’ve been in college. I have 
hurt myself and others around me, 
and I often don’t know why. Many 
of the worst mistakes I have made 
revolved around a woman, and 
nearly all of them occurred while 
I was drunk. But these mistakes 
have trailed off precipitously in the 
last two years, a time when I chose 
to leave my fraternity and greatly 
reduced how much I drink.

This, 
I 
suspect, 
is 
not 
 

a coincidence.

Alcohol and Greek life are not 

to blame for the many mistakes I 
made while in college, but their role 
in uncaging my inner demons is 
unmistakable. Being drunk knocks 
down 
many 
different 
personal 

boundaries for different people, as 
does being in a superficial, overly 
masculine environment. But for 
me, they tear away at the reason-
able, empathetic man I aspire to be, 
replacing him with an amoral boy 
trying to out-gun everyone else. 
I’m proud of myself for recogniz-
ing this, and for increasingly trans-
lating my awareness into avoiding 
binge drinking and checking myself 
when I start seeing women as tools 
to improve my self-esteem.

In the stories that I have so often 

heard, from the wild sex at par-
ties to the most brutal rapes and 
assaults, the assaulters are often 
associated with some hyper-mas-
culine group, be it the military, 
the football team or a fraternity. 
In these stories, alcohol has almost 
always been present, as well, usu-
ally in the body of the assaulter.

This, too, I suspect, is not 
 

a coincidence

***

My path to manhood has been a 

difficult one, to say the least. The cul-
ture of this campus, especially when 
it comes to sports, Greek life and 
other male-dominated institutions, 
was not going to smooth my transi-

tion, but steer 
it into a black 
hole 
instead. 

The 
behavior 

encouraged by 
our culture of 
hyper-mascu-
linity and binge 
drinking 
does 

not limit itself 
to males.

Far too many 

of my female friends have been raped, 
sexually assaulted or beaten — not by 
men, but by boys. Boys who want to 
prove something or fill some alcohol-
soaked gap in their soul. Boys like me 
who have gone one step further.

To quote Ta-Nehisi Coates again: 

“After the boy has his moment, the 
man must take the weight.”

While these words have guided 

much of the way I see my transition 
to manhood, a sort of trial by fire 
where I learn from my mistakes, I 
feel it needs to be altered.

For too often, it is not the man who 

takes the weight, but the woman.

GERRY BROOME)/AP

A North Carolina State Highway patrolman walks the grounds on campus following a shooting at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, N.C., Monday, April 13, 2015.
Manhunt begins for former 
student in campus shooting 

Officer says he 
mistakenly used 
handgun to stop 
fleeing suspect 

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — 

Prosecutors charged a reserve 
sheriff’s deputy with manslaugh-
ter Monday in the death of a man 
who was fatally shot as he lay on 
the ground at the officer’s feet — a 
shooting that was certain to raise 
questions about the use of volun-
teer officers to supplement full-
time police.

The sheriff’s office has said 

Robert 
Bates, 
a 
73-year-old 

insurance executive who was 
volunteering on an undercover 
operation in Tulsa, mistakenly 
pulled out his handgun instead of 
his stun gun and shot the suspect 
as he struggled with deputies.

Bates, who is white, was 

charged 
with 
second-degree 

manslaughter 
involving 
“cul-

pable negligence” for the April 2 
death of Eric Harris, a 44-year-
old black man. If convicted, he 
could face up to four years in 
prison.

It was the latest fatal shooting 

by a police officer to draw national 
attention after months of investiga-
tions and protests of other deaths 
in Ferguson, Missouri, New York 
City, Los Angeles and other else-
where.

A video of the incident shot by 

a deputy with a sunglass camera 
and released Friday at the request 
of the victim’s family, shows a dep-
uty chase and tackle Harris, whom 
they said tried to sell an illegal gun 
to an undercover officer.

As the deputy subdues Harris 

on the ground, a gunshot rings out 
and a man says: “Oh, I shot him. I’m 
sorry.”

Harris screams: “He shot me. 

Oh, my God,” and a deputy replies: 
“You f---ing ran. Shut the f--- up.”

When Harris says he’s losing his 

breath, a deputy replies, “F--- your 
breath.”

Harris was treated by medics at 

the scene and died in a Tulsa hos-
pital.

The family said in a statement 

that it was “saddened, shocked, 
confused and disturbed.”

“Perhaps the most disturbing 

aspect of all of this is the inhu-
mane and malicious treatment of 
Eric after he was shot,” the fam-
ily wrote. “These deputies treated 
Eric as less than human. They 
treated Eric as if his life had no 
value.”

At a news conference on Mon-

day, Andre Harris, the victim’s 
brother, said he does not believe the 
shooting was racially motivated.

Oklahoma law defines culpable 

negligence as “the omission to do 
something which a reasonably 
careful person would do, or the 
lack of the usual ordinary care 
and caution in the performance 
of an act usually and ordinar-
ily exercised by a person under 
similar circumstances and con-
ditions,” Tulsa County District 
Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said 
in a statement.

A telephone message left 

Monday with Bates’ attorney, 
Scott Woods, was not immedi-
ately returned.

Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, 

who investigated the shooting 
as an independent consultant 
at the request of the sheriff’s 
office, concluded that Bates had 
been so engrossed in the stress 
of the moment that he did not 
think clearly about what he had 
in his hand.

The use of reserve officers is 

commonplace across Oklahoma 
and much of the nation. Cities 
and counties often turn to them 
for extra manpower because

GOLDSBORO, N.C. (AP) — 

A 20-year-old former commu-
nity college student fatally shot a 
campus print shop director that 
had recently fired him, just as his 
old boss arrived for work Mon-
day morning, school officials and 
authorities said.

A manhunt was underway for 

the suspect, Kenneth Morgan 
Stancil III. Authorities are pursu-
ing him on an open count of mur-
der, Wayne County Sheriff Larry 
Pierce said.

Authorities believe Stancil has 

left the area but is still in North 
Carolina. They have not released a 
motive for the shooting.

Stancil entered a large Wayne 

Community 
College 
building 

around 8 a.m. with a rifle and went 
to the third-floor print shop, per-
haps using a back staircase so he 
would go unnoticed, authorities 
and school officials said. Stan-
cil’s former work-study boss, Ron 
Lane, was killed in the print shop. 
He had worked at the school for 18 
years.

The shooting frightened stu-

dents and the campus was put on 
lockdown as officers stormed the 
building.

First-year student Jovaun Wil-

liams, 24, told The Associated 
Press that he was climbing a stair-
case inside the building and had 
almost reached the second floor 
when he heard a single muffled 
pop.

He recognized the sound as 

a gunshot, similar to the kind 
he heard growing up in a tough 
neighborhood near Long Beach, 
California. He didn’t know where 
it came from.

“You hear a shot and my big-

gest things is, get out of there,” he 
said. “It definitely wasn’t where I 
was at, so that was good enough 
for me.”

By the time he walked back 

downstairs, he saw police offi-
cers running into the building 
with their guns drawn. The 
building, the Wayne Learning 
Center, houses the cafeteria and 
library, among other things, school 
spokeswoman Tara Humphries 
said.

Stancil was a third-year student 

at the college but it wasn’t immedi-
ately clear when he last attended. 
Goldsboro city spokeswoman Kim 
Best said he was let go recently, but 
she didn’t say when.

Police are using helicopters and 

dogs to search for him. Authori-
ties weren’t sure how he left cam-
pus, including whether he left in a 
vehicle.

At 
one 
point, 
authorities 

thought they had cornered the 
shooter in a restroom and fired 
tear gas into it, only to find that it 
was not Stancil in the bathroom, 
Effler said.

Authorities 
have 
described 

Stancil as a white man, about 
5-foot-11, with a goatee and a tat-
too around his left eye and on his 
neck.

Sheriff’s deputies blocked the 

driveway to the white mobile 
home listed as the residence Stan-
cil shared with his mother and two 
younger brothers.

A next-door neighbor on the 

road lined with brick ranch homes, 
Barbara Williams, said Stancil’s 
grandparents lived on the other 
side of the mobile home, where 
they operated an assisted living 
home. A sign in the front yard said 
“Stancil Family Care Home.” An 
elderly man with a cane who 
came to the front door declined 
comment to an AP reporter.

DAMIAN DOVARGANES)/AP

Members of the board committee of the Metropolitan Water District, MWD moved forwards on a proposal that would cut regional 
water deliveries by 15 percent beginning this summer, during a meeting in Los Angeles on Monday, April 13, 2015.
California water suppliers 
to reduce delivery amounts

Officials propose to 
cut regional delivery 
 

by fifteen perecent 
 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — One 

of California’s largest water 
wholesalers 
moved 
forward 

Monday on a plan to reduce 
the amount of water it delivers 
to more than two dozen cities 
and agencies serving 19 million 
people amid the lengthening 
drought.

If approved by the board of 

the Metropolitan Water Dis-
trict of Southern California on 
Tuesday, regional water deliv-
eries would be cut by 15 percent 
beginning in July. The district 
serves parts of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, 
San Bernardino and Ventura 
counties.

The effects of the cuts would 

vary between local water dis-
tricts. Places that have done a 
poor job of conserving would 
have to crack down on outdoor 
watering and take other con-
servation measures and boost 
water rates to avoid paying a 
high price for extra water.

Several committee members 

wanted a deeper cut in deliv-

eries — 20 percent — but were 
outvoted by others who feared 
it could hurt the economy.

Businesses “could be scram-

bling for the hills” if the reduc-
tion was steeper, said Michael 
Touhey, who represents the 
Upper 
San 
Gabriel 
Valley 

Municipal Water District.

California 
is 
enduring 
a 

fourth year of parched condi-
tions, prompting Gov. Jerry 
Brown earlier this month to call 
for a mandatory 25 percent cut 
in urban water use compared 
with 2013 levels.

To meet Brown’s goal, the 

State Water Resources Control 
Board released draft reduction 
targets for more than 400 water 
agencies that must cut their 
water use by anywhere from 
10 percent to 35 percent. The 
targets are based on per-capita 
water use.

MWD’s general manager 

Jeffrey Kightlinger said lim-
iting water supplies to mem-
ber agencies is necessary to 
meet demand and stretch 
storage reserves, which cur-
rently stand at about 1.2 mil-
lion acre-feet, less than half 
of what was in storage at the 
end of 2012.

MWD 
officials 
said 
the 

proposed 
water 
delivery 

restrictions — along with con-
servation, rebate programs and 
other tools — could help local 
water districts meet the gover-
nor’s goal. The cuts would stay 
in effect for a year.

The agency noted that it has 

a proven record of aggressive 
water conservation. Per capita 
water use in Southern Califor-
nia has declined by about 24 
percent since 1990, even as the 
region’s population grew by 5 
million, and it has spent $750 
million over 25 years on water 
use efficiency.

Last year, MWD delivered 2.1 

million acre-feet of water and 
will supply 300,000 acre-feet 
less this year under the pro-
posal. An acre-foot is enough 
to cover a football field with a 
foot of water or meet the annual 
needs of about two households.

Cities that need more water 

would have to pay a penalty 
— up to four times the normal 
price — for extra deliveries.

The proposed tightening of 

water supplies comes as state 
surveyors earlier this month 
found the lowest snow level in 
the Sierra Nevada snowpack in 
65 years of record-keeping.

U.S. Secretary of 
State John Kerry 
objects to decision 

MOSCOW (AP) — President 

Vladimir Putin on Monday sanc-
tioned the delivery of a highly 
capable Russian air defense mis-
sile system to Iran, a game chang-
er move that would significantly 
bolster the Islamic republic’s mili-
tary capability and fuel Israel’s 
concerns.

U.S. Secretary of State John 

Kerry objected to Moscow’s deci-
sion in a phone call to Russian 
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, 
and the White House indicated 
the move could endanger plans to 
ultimately lift sanctions on Iran as 
part of a proposed nuclear deal.

White House press secretary 

Josh Earnest said unity and coor-
dination with nations like Rus-
sia is critical to the success of the 
negotiations. Washington has said 
Moscow played a constructive 
role in the Iranian nuclear talks, 
despite sharp differences between 
Russia and the West over Ukraine.

Putin’s move was quickly wel-

comed by Tehran, while it worried 
Israel, which saw it as a sign that 
Iran already had begun to cash in 
on the emerging nuclear deal with 
world powers that is expected to 
be finalized by the end of June.

Putin’s 
spokesman, 
Dmitry 

Peskov, said the missile system 
could be shipped to Iran at any 
moment.

Russia signed the $800 mil-

lion contract to sell Iran the S-300 
missile system in 2007, but sus-
pended their delivery three years 
later because of strong objections 
from the United States and Israel. 
Putin on Monday lifted that ban.

The preliminary agreement on 

settling the Iranian nuclear stand-
off struck earlier this month made 
the 2010 Russian ban unneces-
sary, Lavrov said in a televised 
statement.

The 
framework 
agreement 

reached by Iran and six world 
powers is intended to significant-

ly restrict its ability to produce 
nuclear weapons while giving it 
relief from international sanc-
tions. The agreement is supposed 
to be finalized by June 30, and 
there is no firm agreement yet on 
how or when to lift the interna-
tional sanctions on Iran.

The S-300 missile system, 

which has a range of up to 200 
kilometers (125 miles) and the 

capability to track down and 
strike multiple targets simul-
taneously, is one of the most 
potent air defense weapons in 
the world.

“The S-300 is exclusively a 

defensive weapon, which can’t 
serve offensive purposes and 
will not jeopardize the security 
of any country, including, of 
course, Israel,” Lavrov said.

Neal Gabler talks 
criticism’s future

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Neal Gabler is not a person 

who can be described with only 
the epithet “writer.” Maybe 
it’d be more accurate to call 
him 
“writer-journalist-critic-

professor-broadcaster 
Neal 

Gabler.” Gabler, who came to 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

on April 9 to give a lecture on 
whether film criticism is truly 
necessary, may not write much 
criticism himself anymore, but 
he certainly has a broad wealth 
of knowledge on the subject.

“Many people talk about this 

as a post-critical age,” Gabler 
said before the lecture, in an 
interview. “Are we in a post-
critical age, where we form our 
judgments for ourselves and 
we don’t need that other layer 
in between ourselves and the 
film?”

Gabler was invited to give 

the lecture by professor Hugh 
Cohen of the Screen Arts and 
Cultures 
department. 
Gabler 

and Cohen became “friends 
in film” when Gabler attended 
the University as a student and 
joined a film society in which 
Cohen was the adviser. After 
years of talking about movies, 
seeing movies and traveling 
to hear major directors speak, 
Cohen asked Gabler to leave law 
school and become one of the 
first GSIs for his new course, 
which became the preliminary 
course for all Screen Arts and 
Cultures majors: SAC 236, The 
Art of Film.

“I was fully entrenched in 

the film community here, and 
it’s all because of Hugh Cohen,” 
Gabler said. “He was best man at 
my wedding. He was my friend 
and my father and a lot of other 
things.”

Gabler said, at that time, 

though film was important to 
culture all across the country, 
Ann Arbor was the best place to 
be a film connoisseur. Having 
edited the daily newspaper at 
Lane High School in Chicago and 
feeling alienated in Ann Arbor, 
Gabler decided to write film 
criticism for the Michigan Daily.

“I was writing very, very 

long pieces,” said Gabler, who 
was inspired by the long pieces 
of Pauline Kael, the acclaimed 
New Yorker critic. “I was told, 
‘You wrote more column inches 
for The Michigan Daily than 
any person in the history of the 
paper.’”

Before the lecture on Thursday, 

Gabler stopped by Cohen’s class 
on writing film criticism to have 
a discussion with the students. 
Each student shared their interest 
in film criticism and their reasons 
behind it. Gabler noted that there 
was no single critic who everyone 
in the class reads — evidence of a 
growing divisiveness in the film 
community.

“There are no venues for 

(film criticism),” Gabler said, 
explaining why he rarely writes 
criticism anymore. “There’s no 
place to write criticism, certainly 
not the kind that I like to write: 
long, sustained, analytical pieces. 
Secondly, when you’re an active 
working critic, you’re reviewing 
everything. I was seeing five 
movies a week. Every year, if 
you’re really lucky, maybe you 
get three or four movies that are 
worth engaging.”

Gabler 
still 
occasionally 

writes about movies, but his 
interests have broadened. He is 
currently writing an expansive 
biography of Edward “Ted” 
Kennedy.

Gabler also teaches one class 

a year at the State University 
of New York at Stony Brook. 
He has taught classes on film 
criticism, creative nonfiction, 
biography and the essay.

“My interest is twofold,” 

Gabler said. “I try to teach them 
how to become professionals. 
I’m never interested in just a 
skill set. I try to teach them 
how to think about the world in 
interesting ways. I get up every 
day and I say to myself, ‘What 
interesting thing do I have to say 
about the world today?’ That’s 
what I try to get my students to 
do: to think about the world in 
interesting ways because you 
can sell that kind of work, and 
it’s worth writing.”

Though Gabler calls himself 
 

“a writer who teaches” instead 
of “a teacher who writes,” he 
cares deeply about education 
and encouraging his students to 
explore new points of view.

“I’m not just teaching how to 

write an essay,” Gabler said. “If 
I’m good at what I do, I’m trying 
to teach you how to think about 
the world. You take that little 
piece, and you put it into your 
own sensibility, and then you’ll 
have another teacher and plug 
that into your sensibility. By 
the time you’re through with 
your education, you’ve got all 
these things out of which you’ve 
formed your own sensibility. 
That, to me, is the whole 
function of education.”

In both Cohen’s class and 

Gabler’s lecture Thursday night, 
Gabler emphasized the danger 
of aggregate scores from sites 
like Rotten Tomatoes. He also 
explained that criticism should 

be more about exploring new 
perspectives on a piece than 
completing a checklist about 
what strengths and weaknesses 
a film does and does not have.

“It’s 
an 
instantaneous 

culture, 
and 
you 
want 

something 
instant,” 
Gabler 

said. “I’m an extremely strong 
believer that you adjust to the 
film; the film does not adjust to 
you. I don’t have some sort of 
critical rubric that I apply to a 
movie. Never.”

Gabler occasionally misses 

the days when film had such 
a prominent role in culture. 
In his view, the proliferation 
of Internet criticism, social 
media and a constant stream 
of information have led to a 
drastically different — if not 
objectively worse — role for 
film.

“Individual movies matter, 

but the movies (of the canon) 
don’t 
matter,” 
Gabler 
said. 

“They don’t dominate our lives 
in the same way they once did. 
They don’t rouse passions the 
way they once did. And if the 
movies 
don’t 
matter 
much, 

neither does film criticism.”

Still, 
Gabler 
does 

acknowledge 
that 
criticism 

may still hold great power. 
In 
Gabler’s 
view, 
common 

objections to criticism, like that 
reading criticism takes away 
from the magic of the film, are 
often misplaced.

“(Reading criticism) is not, I 

emphasize, mutually exclusive 
with any other movie-going 
pleasure,” Gabler said. “It’s an 
addition to the pleasure. Why 
would anyone want to deny 
himself or herself that pleasure? 
Why would anyone want to 
shrink the movie?”

One 
of 
the 
issues 
with 

widespread Internet criticism, 
Gabler said, is its inaccessibility.

“The 
object 
is 
not 
to 

demonstrate how smart you 
are, but how generous you are,” 
Gabler said. “Do we really need 
film criticism? Yes, I think we 
do. I think we need this kind 
of criticism: a criticism that 
enables us to see what we might 
not otherwise have seen, that 
enables us to learn something 
about ourselves, others and 
the world that we might not 
otherwise have learned.”

In the 1970s, when film and 

criticism flourished together, 
there was a symbiosis between 
filmmaker 
and 
film 
critic, 

Gabler said.

“Every so often, I see a 

film, and I really wish there 
was a critic to analyze it in 
some interesting way, a critic 
against whom I could weigh my 
own interpretation, a critic to 
challenge me and illuminate the 
film,” Gabler said, comparing 
Pauline 
Kael’s 
widespread 

accessibility to lesser-known 
modern critics. 

Still, Gabler hopes modern 

criticism 
can 
overcome 
its 

limitations 
and 
regain 
the 

power it used to hold.

“(Critics) are vital to our art, 

and they are vital to us,” Gabler 
said. “You don’t analyze a movie 
to death. If you are a good critic, 
an essential critic, you actually 
analyze it to life.”

“There are 

no venues for 
film criticism 

anymore.”

ARTS INTERVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW
Storm feels stale

Despite some new 
tricks, Halestorm’s 

newest album is 
achingly familiar

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Halestorm’s newest record, 

Into the Wild Life comes three 
years after The Strange Case 
Of ... ; howev-
er, after their 
break, 
they 

seem to have 
lost some of the 
chic 
pseudo-

rock touch that 
breathed 
life 

into their work.

Opening 

with “Scream,” 
Halestorm 
presents low-laying verses over 
a consistent drumbeat, which 
soars into the chorus only to 
fall flat as lead singer Lzzy Hale 
repeats a synthesized “scream.” 
In the same vain, “I Am the 
Fire” builds and builds, but 
once the chorus arrives it feels 
hollow.

About eight minutes into the 

album, there is finally some 
semblance of the Halestorm 
infectiousness on “Sick Indi-
vidual.” The verses consist of 
quick, evenly delivered lines 
over a repeating guitar riff and 
parley themselves seamlessly 
into the chorus. This track, 
unlike its predecessors, doesn’t 
aim for a climactic chorus, and 
the result is the fluidity that is 
absent on “Scream” and “I Am 
the Fire.”

Even though the climactic 

rock chorus approach failed in 
the first two tracks, Halestorm 
perfects it in “Amen” — it’s 
catchy, maybe a tad unorigi-
nal. But when a song makes you 
scream and bang your head, 
who cares if it feels like you’ve 
heard the lyrics before? This 
is the first song that makes me 
want to give an amen.

“Dear Daughter” marks the 

beginning of Into the Wild Life’s 
slump. If “Amen” felt familiar 
in the best way, “Dear Daugh-
ter” feels so in the worst way. 
The production fails to keep the 
edge of rock that normally char-
acterizes Halestorm’s slower 
songs. It’s emotional, but not 
powerful; and, in the end, it’s 
boring. It just makes me think 
how 
much 
better 
Martina 

McBride’s “This One’s For The 
Girls” is. Also in the slump, 
“New Modern Love” sounds 
like the score of an unevent-
ful western movie. “Mayhem” 
lures listeners in with its pre-
chorus whisperings, but soon 
Hale is screaming and, for the 
first time in her discography, 
it feels as though she’s scream-
ing about nothing. “Bad Girls 
World” is a less cohesive “Dear 
Daughter,” but it isn’t as upfront 
with its badness. The hook has 
some grit, but after about half 
the song you can’t help but 
think to yourself, “Is this worth 
my time?”

The album somehow finds its 

way back on “Gonna Get Mine.” 
This is what Into The Wild Life 
should be. It’s gritty, in your 
face and takes no prisoners. 
Here, the subtlety of “Mayhem” 
’s pre-chorus gets a full show-
ing in “Gonna Get Mine” ’s tit-
illating chorus. The transition 

into the low-tempo “The Reck-
oning” is rough. Maybe “wild 
life” refers to the ups and downs 
present on the record because 
not after long the album’s lead 
single, “Apocalyptic” slams lis-
teners down and makes them 
listen. From the first verse to 
the final beats, “Apocalyptic” 
is without a doubt the album’s 
shining star. The verses and 
chorus soar lyrically and inter-
mingle perfectly with guitars 
and drums. The rhymes are 
subtle enough to avoid sounding 
cheesy, but prominent enough to 
wrap Hale’s delivery in a slick-
ness that has been missing for 
most of the LP.

The record ends on one of 

its strongest notes — “I Like It 
Heavy.” The slight synth heard in 
the verses creates a strong contrast 
with the brashness of the chorus. 
It captures the aura of Hale and 
leaves listeners with one lyric: 
“Hallelujah motherfucker, take me 
to church.”

Halestorm’s 
experimentation 

on Into the Wild Life resulted in 
a mix of glossy rock songs, some 
pointless screaming and a few 
tracks that aren’t recognizable as 
Halestorm at all. Experimenta-
tion aside, Halestorm has added 
another handful of head-banging 
rock songs to their ever-evolving 
repertoire.

The power of music 
to draw out time

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

Where 
are 
you? 
Right 

now, right this very second. 
Maybe you’re in the UGLi, 
procrastinating finishing that 
paper due at midnight. Perhaps 
you live in a quaint cottage in 
Iowa and you’re reading this 
next to your roaring fireplace 
because of your keen, if a 
little misplaced, interest in 
the happenings here at the 
University. Or maybe you’re 
my mom, reading this because 
I know you stalk me day and 
night. (Hi, mom.)

Forget all that. That’s not 

what you’re doing. At this 
exact moment in time, you are 
on a rock hurtling through 
space and revolving around 
an extremely hot ball of gas at 
a speed of approximately 18.5 
miles per second. (For those of 
you who struggle with numbers 
like myself, that’s really fast.) 
There are thousands of planets 
circling their own suns, many 
of which might sustain life, 
and some of which think they 
are the only sentient beings in 
an ever-expanding universe. 
Who knows, maybe somewhere 
out there an exact duplicate 
of Earth is floating around, 
except Justin Bieber is the one 
roasting Martha Stewart.

In the grand scheme of 

things, 
human 
life 
serves 

remarkably little purpose aside 
from living out a set number 
of years on a tiny speck in the 
universe. 
The 
Sun 
doesn’t 

give a shit that you failed your 
Econ midterm or that you 
finally kissed that boy in your 
Wednesday discussion. (This 
is supposed to be a lot more 
comforting than it sounds, I 
promise.)

To counteract and mask all 

this morbidity, humans created 
time. If we set goals that exist 
within certain timeframes, our 
short stories on Earth seem 
slightly 
more 
accomplished 

and if people remember you 
then, whoa, now you’ve really 
made it big.

(Yes, I’m bringing this back 

around to music, just give me a 
moment.)

My point is, we are allotted 

x number of days to live on 

this lovely planet and how 
we choose to spend them is 
entirely up to ourselves. Yes, 
some classes can feel like they 
last an eternity, while other 
moments pass in the blink of 
an eye. And in a world so full 
of deadlines and alarms it’s 
crucial for your sanity to step 
back and take those three 
minutes to listen to that song 
that makes you feel like time 
has stopped.

You know the songs that I’m 

talking about — the ones that 
make moments slow down and 
worries seem insignificant. It’s 
not necessarily your favorite 
song, or even a good one, but 
it’s the one that sticks with 
you long after it has stopped 
playing. 

It could just be a line or 

a lyric, or even just a quick 
guitar riff that resonates with 
something inside you, but for 
that one instant it’s just you 
and that song. Forget those 
millions of people bustling 
about in their own lives — these 
three minutes are yours. 

I have a few songs of my 

own, one of them being Jimi 

Hendrix’s 
“All 
Along 
the 

Watchtower,” and I save it for 
those times when everything 
needs 
to 
stop, 
just 
for 
a 

moment. (Don’t ask me why 
Jimi Hendrix, because I still 
don’t know.) Similarly, I was 
crying the first time I listened 
to 
“Landfill” 
by 
Daughter, 

and, while it is an odd song, 
I’ll never forget how much it 
meant to me when I was 14. 

It’s 
during 
these 
times 

that I realize how much the 
world 
needs 
music. 
Movies 

and television shows are both 
valiant forms of entertainment 
that definitely have merit, but 
it’s music that drives this media 
forward. A movie without a 
soundtrack falls short, because 
removing its sound removes its 
soul and leaves the viewer with 
little 
emotional 
attachment 

to what they just watched. 
The swelling of violins, steady 
drums 
or 
electronic 
beats 

all play an important role in 
dictating how the audience 
should feel and allows these 
larger-than-life 
moments 
to 

linger, even after you’ve left 
the theater or switched off the 
television.

Mark 
Ruffalo’s 
character 

speaks a line in the movie “Begin 
Again” that encompasses what 
I’ve been trying to say in a much 
shorter word count: “That’s 
what I love about music. All 
these banalities suddenly turn 
into beautiful pearls.”

We aren’t given very long on 

this Earth, but with the right 
music, any time can feel like a 
lifetime.

‘Odyssey’ is one 
third a good show 

Multiple storylines 
fail to coalesce in 
new NBC series

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“American Odyssey” is a 

solid “third of a show.” Telling 
the interlocking stories of three 
people plunged 
into the middle 
of an interna-
tional 
emer-

gency, 
NBC’s 

latest 
drama 

is only able to 
produce 
one 

strong plotline 
among medio-
cre others that 
are marred in 
predictability 
and flat char-
acters.

The first and strongest of 

these threads is that of Odelle 
Ballard (Anna Friel, “Pushing 
Daisies”), a special forces oper-
ative whose squad uncovers 
files that potentially connect 
Al-Qaeda with an American 
corporation, S.O.C. After her 
unit is brutally attacked and 
executed by the Blackwater-
esque O.S.E.L.A, Odelle finds 
herself the lone survivor just 
trying to live another day and 
get back home to her husband 
and daughter.

The storyline puts its entire 

weight on Friel, who is more 
than up to the challenge. The 
actress displays a persever-
ance in her character that goes 
beyond dogged determination. 
Trapped in a hostile nation and 
pursued by a brutal group of 
mercenaries, Odelle is the char-
acter going through the titular 
“odyssey” in her quest to get 
home against insurmountable 
odds. 

The show couples its nar-

rative ambition with dynamic 
visuals. Use of long takes dur-

ing the opening combat situa-
tions reveals the well-trained 
unit Odelle helps command, 
but the most impressive cam-
era work comes when the story 
becomes constricted. During 
the first episode, “Gone Elvis,” 
Odelle finds herself captive in 
a manhole cage. In the scenes 
depicting her imprisonment, 
the frame is almost entirely 
restricted to her trapped view-
point as she begs her captors. 
When a woman burns herself, 
the tension rises as Odelle 
instructs a teenager, Aslam 
(newcomer Omar Ghazaoui), in 
helping the woman while the 
viewer struggles along with her 
to assess the situation.

This combination of charac-

terization and ambitious craft 
make Odelle’s sections worth 
watching. However, the rest of 
“American Odyssey,” is not so 
compelling. 

There’s corporate attorney 

Peter (Peter Facinelli, “Twi-
light”), who realizes something 
fishy is going on with his client, 
S.O.C., and begins to investi-
gate. Meanwhile social activist 
Harrison (Jake Robinson, “The 
Carrie Diaries”) meets a para-
noid conspiracy theorist named 
Bob (Nate Mooney, “It’s Always 
Sunny in Philadelphia”), who 
isn’t as crazy as he sounds.

Peter and Harrison are most-

ly blank slates, ready to tackle 
the dark truths they uncover — 

Facinelli and Robinson do what 
they can — but the characters 
aren’t very intriguing in them-
selves. Instead, all the intrigue 
is displaced to the events that 
surround them. There are snip-
pets of backstory, but the show 
throws you so many side char-
acters and mysterious organiza-
tions that there is little time to 
get to know Peter and Harrison. 
While Odelle is given time to 
develop as a character, the con-
spiracy trumps any real develop-
ment for her two counterparts.

But the growing conspiracy 

suffers from being overly famil-
iar. Every death and “disap-
pearance” is easy to see coming. 
There’s also the traditional “He 
knows,” phone call between vil-
lains after one of the protago-
nists uncovers key information. 
There’s nothing really that sur-
prising to catch a well-versed 
viewer off-guard, keeping the 
show from becoming the thriller 
it aspires to be.

It’s commendable to see NBC 

air a show with such an ambi-
tious nature, but this ambition is 
overshadowed by a lacking pilot. 
There is some strong cinema-
tography and performances, but 
they all seemed centered on one 
particular storyline right now. 
If “American Odyssey” is going 
to be a journey worth taking, it 
needs to find a better balance 
between its three primary plot 
threads.

Listen to life’s music

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

A lot of people on campus 

are into working out. I couldn’t 
even do a somersault when I was 
a kid, so you can imagine how 
inadequate I feel when, almost 
every day, a marathoner whiz-
zes past my vanilla latte and 
me — a couple who are perfectly 
happy together, I might add 
(and going two years strong), 
and travel at a content, glacial 
pace. Feeling particularly lazy 
last Friday afternoon, I tried 
some wonky YouTube cardio 
workout in my dorm. It was bad; 
I was so bad. Thank goodness I 
write for this paper. Typing is 
my aerobics.

One thing to note about 

humans who partake in regu-
lar physical activity: almost all 
listen to music while they’re 
doing said activity. Every time 
a plugged-in pedestrian passes 
me, I find myself in intrigued. 
What’s going on in your ears, 
dear gentleman? Do you run to 
the gruffness of Led Zeppelin, 
or do you glide to the efferves-
cence, the timelessness of Pit-
bull? Is “King Kunta” by (Sir) 
Kendrick 
Lamar 
motivating 

you, or are you pushed to finish 
those last few miles by T. Swiz-
zle’s “Blank Space”? 

Whatever it is, you’re missing 

out. 

Now, a disclaimer: I am a 

firm believer in music’s mys-
tical powers. It elevates your 
mood, inspires you and it defi-
nitely motivates you. Runners 
have every right to listen to 
music while they’re voluntarily 
killing their bodies; they need 
something to take the edge 
off. The issue lies with walk-
ers, like myself. So many saun-
ter the streets of Ann Arbor, 
Beats firmly planted over their 

ears, on a strict mission to not 
be disturbed by anything, ever. 
Maybe they’re going home, or 
maybe they’re making a beeline 
to Espresso Royale to quell that 
sleep depravation (relatable) – 
regardless, they’re not paying 
attention.

We’re all guilty of this. It’s 

so easy to pop in headphones 
and forget the world. Music is 
comforting, 
and 
sometimes, 

when you’re walking around 
the city, it just feels right to lis-
ten to whatever tune is making 
you feel the most alive lately. 
Whether it’s looking at a tall 
building (“The Immortals” by 
Kings of Leon), strolling aim-
lessly (“Carbon Monoxide” by 
Regina Spektor) or trying to get 
somewhere quickly (“Y.A.L.A.” 
by M.I.A.), there seems to be a 
song for everything.

Right? Wrong. Well, kind of.
We live in a city that offers 

a new symphony every day 
— 
something 
better 
than 

Beethoven, better than Juicy 
J. As I walk, and I walk, and I 
walk, into town from my dorm 
on The Hill, I hear music with-
out headphones. The cars whiz-
zing past under the bridge, the 
girl on her phone yelling at her 
mom about this pair of boots 
that she somehow can’t live 
without, the crunch of the guy’s 
shoes in front of me, the wind, 
the rain. It may seem cacopho-
nous, distracting, a burden and 
you may have to listen a little 
harder sometimes — but it’s 
music. 

As I sit outside Espresso 

Royale on Main St., on a warm 
Saturday afternoon, I hear and 
see people walking by. Lov-
ers (so many lovers), families, 
friends. There’s a little boy 
walking down the street next 
to his parents with a long cane, 
feeling his way forward. I feel 

guilty, at first, that he can’t see 
this beautiful day. But as I hear 
the percussive taps of his cane, 
the melodic crescendo of excite-
ment when his dad says they’re 
going to get mac and cheese for 
dinner (“mmmMMM”) and see 
his euphoric face, I realize that 
I’m listening and watching life’s 
own music video. That’s better 
than anything you’ll ever see on 
MTV. 

If I had been plugged into 

my phone that whole time, sub-
consciously forgoing that little 
boy for Lil Wayne, I would’ve 
missed out on something one-
of-a-kind. As brilliant as Wayne 
is, I can hear his music as much 
as I want, at the press of button. 
I’ll probably never see that little 
boy again — and I’ll definitely 
never hear him like that again. 
The second we hit the pavement 
every day, we’re hearing a brand 
new song, unique to our ears. It 
doesn’t take a certain amount of 
battery charge or Wi-Fi to load 
it. It’s just us. The scariest part 
is we’ll never be able to play 
that song again, but that’s also 
the most electric — we must, 
then, listen harder to the world 
around us, soaking it all in, and 
add to our melody with our own 
footsteps, breathing, humming. 

A little time passes as I’m 

walking home from the café, 
and a car creeps up on the street 
my back is facing — a cruising, 
vintage 
’70-something 
whip 

with a long torso. In it is an old 
man wearing a Bogart-esque 
hat and a full, white suit. He’s 
blasting some old blues tune; it 
sounds like John Lee Hooker to 
me, and I immediately crane my 
neck to see him drive by. He’s so 
badass, I think, as flashes of my 
blues-ridden childhood begin to 
joyously flood my mind. If you 
let go and unplug, sometimes 
the music finds you.

STYLE REVIEW
Fashion comes to 
focus at Dance Mix

By MARA MACLEAN

Daily Arts Writer

Dance performances, which 

showcased a diverse set of tal-
ent across several University 
dance groups, wowed the crowd 
on Friday, April 10 at the Michi-
gan Theater. Some captured the 
crowd’s attention with glow 
sticks or breakdancing, and oth-
ers commanded the stage with 
their tap soles and pirouettes. 

Almost as captivating as the 

graceful and powerful move-
ments were the strategic cos-
tume 
choices. 
Many 
dance 

groups form costume commit-
tees to discuss a certain look 
for a performance. Some groups 
will brainstorm ideas and then 
allow the dancers to choose 
a comfortable option that fits 
within their theme. Other com-
mittee heads will choose identi-
cal costumes for each member. 

Some clothing choices were 

simple and nondescript, allow-
ing the dance to carry the 
show forward. Salto, a ballet 
and lyrical group, wore basic 
black leotards and long skirts 
to accentuate their classical, 
streamlined movements. Oth-
ers, like Michigan Izzat, chose 
outfits that played along with 
their storytelling dance. The 
men wore sequined sailor out-
fits for their “Pearl Harbor” 
performance, tying in their 
themes of adventure and broth-
erhood.

And, of course, there were 

groups who just looked effort-
lessly cool.

Contemporary 
company, 

Impact Dance, and modern 
group, Cadence, leaned toward 
simple, 
black 
attire 
that 

allowed for easy movement. 
In turn, the audience focused 
on their technical movements, 
which 
were 
highlighted 

against stark backgrounds. The 
clothing allowed their flowing 
and gravitational movements 
to seem all the more angular 
and expressive in Impact’s 
performance 
to 
Beyoncé’s 

“Haunted” 
and 
Cadence’s 

dance to “Wait” by M83.

The 
Michigan 
Bhangra 

Team 
performs 
traditional 

dances 
from 
the 
state 
of 

Punjab, India to preserve the 
core values of their culture. 
The members were outfitted 
in bright colors with beautiful 
embellishments, 
typical 
of 

Punjabi attire. The team wore 
traditional 
muteyaar, 
which 

LSA junior and member Howie 
Magaro said is essential for the 
traditional folk dance.

“I 
think 
the 
costume 

contributes a lot to the whole 
presentation. It’s very colorful 
and it brings a pop to the 
performance,” he said.

FunKtion, the first all-male, 

multicultural hip-hop dance 
group 
on 
campus, 
brought 

the cool to Dance Mix with 
smooth 
moves, 
hilarious 

stage presences and flawless 
costumes. The boys sported 

mock varsity jackets and khakis 
for their first performance and 
later rolled out in custom boiler 
suits. The looks begged for the 
comparison to the T-Birds from 
“Grease.” 

EnCore, 
a 
co-ed 
hip-

hop 
group, 
gave 
a 
strong 

performance to go along with 
their “Career Day” set. Each 
dancer wore some variation of 
children’s clothing: overalls, 
denim 
or 
primary 
colors. 

Engineering 
freshman 
and 

member Allison Goss said the 
denim 
and 
primary 
colors 

allowed them to look youthful 
but still could transition into 
some of the sexier routines. 
The movements flow from 
what the dancers put on their 
bodies.

“If you’re comfortable in a 

costume, you dance better,” 
Goss said. “If we don’t feel 
the movement while we are 
wearing 
our 
costumes, 
it 

won’t portray well with the 
audience.”

The 
routines 
at 
Dance 

Mix were inspirational and 
entertaining 
and 
endless 

hours of practice and physical 
strength were needed to pull 
off such an excellent show. 
However, the costumes cannot 
be forgotten as an essential 
part 
to 
any 
performance. 

Clothing allows free movement 
so 
every 
dance 
move 
is 

enhanced — every grand jeté 
more graceful and every crump 
more powerful.

Michigan heads into 
two midweek games

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

will head into a pair of midweek 
games against in-state rivals on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, looking 
to stay perfect 
in such games 
this season.

Tuesday, 

the Wolverines 
head to Detroit 
to 
take 
on 

Michigan State 
at 
Comerica 

Park, and they 
return 
home 

Wednesday 
to 

face 
Eastern 

Michigan.

Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 21-14 

overall) has caught fire lately, 
winning nine of its last 11 games. 
The Wolverines are looking to 
use these midweek matchups to 
work some injured players back to 
full strength in preparation for a 
postseason run.

Two of those players, junior 

pitchers Evan Hill and Keith 
Lehmann, were big contributors 
to last year’s weekend pitching 
rotation.

Hill is returning from a knee 

injury, and though he has thrown 
just 5.1 innings this season, he 
seems to be in mid-season form, 
allowing only one earned run to 
cross the plate. His last outing 
lasted two innings, so the team 
is looking for the junior to extend 
himself to the middle innings 
against the Spartans (4-5 Big Ten, 
18-15 overall) on Tuesday.

Hill’s 
only 
outing 
against 

Michigan State came during 
his freshman campaign, when 
he threw eight strong innings, 
allowing one run in a 5-1 victory.

Currently, Michigan State is 

playing some of its best baseball, 
having won six of its last eight 
games. The Spartans currently sit 
in eighth place in the conference 
standings — two spots behind 
Michigan.

The right-handed Lehmann 

hasn’t 
pitched 
since 
facing 

Kansas on March 15, missing 
time due to a forearm strain. He 
and Hill were two mainstays in 
the Michigan starting pitching 
rotation in 2014, and they will 
have a chance to contribute in 
big ways as the team looks to 
improve on its 3.67 earned-run 
average — just seventh-best in 
the conference.

Lehmann 
will 
lead 
the 

Wolverines against the Eagles 
(4-8 MAC, 13-22 overall) as the 
two teams face off for the second 
time in the last eight days. Last 
Tuesday, the Wolverines poured 
18 runs on Eastern Michigan, the 
second-most the team has scored 
in a game this season.

Michigan has only one more 

week this season featuring two 
midweek games, but coach Erik 
Bakich doesn’t mind the weekday 
games much.

“Ideally we would just play 

one (midweek game), that way 
we could have another day of 
practice,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“(It’s 

especially 
big) 
during 
the 

academic year when our guys are 
juggling school. But to be honest, 
whether we’re playing four or 
five games per week is of little 
impact.”

Usually the opponents for 

these games come from mid-
major conferences, like the MAC 
or Horizon League, but this week 
the Wolverines face a fellow Big 
Ten member in Michigan State. 
Since the two teams weren’t 
scheduled to play in conference 
games for consecutive seasons, 
they scheduled a neutral-site 
matchup to give fans a taste of the 
rivalry.

Bakich 
stresses 
that 
his 

team’s goals are all about getting 
better during these midweek 
games, no matter the opponent. 
Improving its conference-best 
.299 team batting average could 
prove difficult for Michigan 
no matter the opponent, but 
keeping the positive momentum 
rolling through another few 
midweek games will be key for 
this squad in its march for the 
Big Ten crown.

Keeping up no easy task 
for Wolverines, Big Ten

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

There are many reasons high 

school softball players wouldn’t 
want to come play in the Big Ten.

Historically, the Pac-12 is and 

always has been the conference 
to beat. Twenty-four of the 33 
Women’s College World Series 
titles belong to teams from the 
Pac-12, and six more belong 
to other teams west of the 
Mississippi River.

Recently, Southern schools 

have made a strong surge. Since 
2007, eight teams from the SEC 
have competed in the national 
championship, and last year’s 
battle 
was 
a 
Southeastern 

showdown between Alabama 
and Florida. This year, with LSU, 
Oregon and Florida holding the 
top three spots, many would 
favor the Pac-12 or SEC to come 
out on top again.

For nearly the entire Big Ten 

conference, playing at home isn’t a 
legitimate option until mid- to late 
March. Big Ten teams on average 
competed in 28.47 games before 
their first home contest. While 
traveling out of the cold weather 
to start the season is enticing, the 
strenuous weekly trips across the 
country become exhaustive.

When looking at the top teams 

from the SEC, travel is not a 
problem. No. 1 LSU played 20 of 
its first 25 games this season at 
home, and No. 3 Florida never 
left the Sunshine State for its first 
27 games.

Finally, the top 25 rankings for 

college softball currently contain 
nine teams from the SEC and 
six from the Pac-12, but just two 
from the Big Ten.

Yet somehow, among all the 

difficulties and issues Big Ten 
softball teams face, those two 
teams, No. 4 Michigan and No. 
19 Minnesota, manage to keep up 
with the rest of the country.

For the Big Ten to stay 

relevant, it’s important for these 
teams to face highly ranked 
opponents early in the season 
before the conference schedule 
starts. Through the preseason, 
the Wolverines matched up with 
five different top-25 teams. In 
conference play, they face only 
one.

“People will sometimes forget 

about the Big Ten teams because 
we are so far away,” said junior 
infielder Sierra Romero, who was 
raised in southern California. 
“During preseason, we go and 
play in places like California to 
go out and get wins against big 
teams.”

Despite the high level of 

competition out west, Romero 
left home to join Michigan in the 
Big Ten. Along 
with Romero, 
three 
other 

consistent 
starters 
come 
from 

California. In 
fact, out of the 
10 Wolverines 
that 
have 

appeared in at 
least 20 games, only one comes 
from the state of Michigan, 
and just three come from the 
Midwest. Michigan’s core talent 
is largely based around players 
from other parts of the country.

Junior 
outfielder 
Sierra 

Lawrence and sophomore right-
handed pitcher Megan Betsa 
both came to Michigan from 
Georgia. Growing up in SEC 

country, Betsa was still drawn up 
north to Michigan. However, she 
acknowledged the strength of 
Southern teams as a whole.

“They all have very strong 

lineups one through nine,” Betsa 
said. “For pitching there aren’t 
any holes, and the number nine 
batter is just as strong as the two 
and three batters.”

Even though the Big Ten 

doesn’t have the same depth as 
high-caliber teams, Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins 
has 

succeeded in building a program 
that stays in line with the rest of 
the country. Her coaching style 
and habits are factors all her 
players mention when discussing 
why 
they 
chose 
to 
attend 

Michigan over other powerhouse 
schools around the country.

“Personally, 
I 
felt 
that 

(Hutchins) 
genuinely 
cares 

about all her players,” said junior 
outfielder Kelsey Susalla. “She 
cares not just about our athletic 

ability, 
but 

about 
our 

character and 
academics 
as 

well.”

Added 

sophomore 
infielder Abby 
Ramirez: 
“What I think 
was the most 

attractive thing here was the 
tradition. The team and the 
coaching staff was a big part of 
decision. She wants what’s best 
for you as a person.”

Growing up in East Lansing, 

playing basketball and softball 
for Michigan State and working 
as an assistant coach at Indiana 
meant the Big Ten has always 
been home for Hutchins.

“You know, I’ve been in the 

Big Ten my whole life,” Hutchins 
said. “I think what I love most 
about the conference, at least 
from the softball view of it, is the 
amount of respect we have team 
for team, coach for coach, and 
even the new coaches that come 
in. We have huge amounts of 
respect for the game and for the 
institutions in the conference.

“We all really believe in playing 

with integrity, we all support 
each other in our conference 
endeavors, we support each other 
to win outside the conference, 
and we stick together.”

The Big Ten doesn’t have a 

reputation for softball prestige, 
and it doesn’t have a history of 
winning championships. But the 
one title it does have belongs to 
Michigan, and year after year, 
Michigan continues to fight for it, 
despite the impossible odds they 
face in the frigid Midwest.

Kyle Connor: ‘A player to watch’

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

may have taken a spear to the 
heart when its captain, Andrew 
Copp, decided to forgo his senior 
season and join the Winnipeg 
Jets.

But there is a silver lining. 

Copp’s absence in the lineup will 
provide opportunities for others 
to fill his production — he tallied 
31 points this past season.

Look no further than blue-

chip recruit Kyle Connor. The 
Shelby 
Township, 
Michigan 

native has torn up the United 
States Hockey League the past 
three years — registering 195 
points in three seasons with the 
Youngstown Phantoms — and 
that has Michigan coach Red 
Berenson excited.

“Kyle Connor, he’ll be a player 

to watch,” Berenson said. “Right 
now, he’ll be the main recruit to 
watch.”

More 
notably, 
Berenson 

wouldn’t 
rule 
out 
Connor 

having 
a 
similar 
freshman 

season to that of Dylan Larkin, 
who was just named a second-
team All American and the 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year. 
He notched 47 points in his 
sensational freshman campaign.

“Maybe he could,” Berenson 

said of Connor’s chances of 
emulating Larkin. “He’s that 
type of player.”

That could be premature. But 

if Connor’s USHL stats are any 
indication, he has the tools to 
become an impact player for the 
Wolverines.

Connor just put an exclamation 

point on his final season with the 
Phantoms, scoring his 33rd and 
34th goals in his final game. His 
80 points are already a personal 
record and lead the USHL this 
year. More impressively, his 195 
points in three seasons are the 
sixth-most in USHL history, and 
he still has playoff games to raise 
his total.

Clearly, the USHL is becoming 

too easy for Connor and he needs 
more of a challenge. He’ll be 
joining a Michigan team that 
has failed to make the NCAA 
Tournament for three straight 

seasons after qualifying for the 
post season 22 straight years 
before.

But that doesn’t faze Connor.
“I think that is something 

I’m definitely coming in to do, 
trying to get them back in the 
right direction,” Connor said. “I 
think I can step in right away and 
go out there and try to compete 
and help us get back to the 
tournament.”

Back 
in 

November, 
Phantoms 
coach Anthony 
Noreen 
gushed about 
his star. He 
told the Daily 
that 
Connor 

has an “NHL 
release on his shot,” possesses 
“an elite skill level” and is a 
“student of the game.”

Though it’s bittersweet for 

Noreen to lose Connor, he knows 
Connor will be in good hands 
with the legendary Berenson.

And Connor is also excited 

to play for Berenson, who will 
be in his 32nd season behind 
Michigan’s bench when Connor 
first takes the ice in a winged 
helmet.

“Red Berenson, his pedigree 

and resume speaks for itself,” 
Connor said. “He is such a great 

guy, and it’s going to be fun 
playing for him next year. I’m 
really looking forward to it.”

Connor grew up a Michigan 

fan, 
and 
he 
has 
watched 

Wolverine hockey games for 
most of his life. And when he 
joins the squad this fall, he’ll 
know a face or two.

Connor grew up playing travel 

hockey for Belle Tire alongside 

freshman 
forward Dylan 
Larkin 
and 

freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski. 
The trio won 
a 
national 

championship 
together, and 

Connor sees no reason why they 
can’t do the same thing in Ann 
Arbor.

Larkin still hasn’t announced 

his return to the program for next 
season, as he could potentially 
leave to join the Detroit Red 
Wings organization.

“I’m still just trying to figure 

it out,” Larkin told the Daily on 
Monday. “It’s straight down the 
middle. Every day it changes and 
things come into play. I don’t 
really know yet.”

Connor and Larkin played 

on the same line for Belle Tire. 

The two had success there, and 
Connor would love to rejoin his 
old linemate while in a Michigan 
sweater.

“We 
clicked 
right 
away, 

and we’ve been good friends,” 
Connor said. “We played roller 
hockey way back in the day. It 
would be pretty fun playing with 
him.”

Added 
Larkin: 
“He’s 
a 

dynamic player who finds a way 
to score at every level he has 
played at. I’m hoping he can come 
in and have an impact. Speaking 
as a freshman, you never want 
the pressure on you, but I think 
he will handle that well. He’s a 
mature kid. We’re excited to have 
him. I have talked to him a little 
bit, and it would be fun to play 
with him.”

Even 
if 
Larkin 
isn’t 
at 

Michigan next season, Connor 
will still be excited to don the 
block ‘M.’ An expected first-
round pick in this year’s NHL 
Draft, Connor said no NHL 
team could convince him to join 
its organization. The same can 
be said for Saginaw Spirit, who 
own his Ontario Hockey League 
rights.

“That’s where I want to play,” 

Connor said of Michigan. “I 
want to play at Michigan, and 
I’ve wanted to play there for a 
long time.”
