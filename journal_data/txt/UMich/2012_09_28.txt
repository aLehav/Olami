STEPPING NEAR THE M

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
UGLi to
open 24/7
starting
October 1

Baits II re-opens to campus

Daily StaffReporter
As midterm season approach-
es, students suffering through a
marathon pre-exam study ses-
sion will soon no longer have to
pack up and leave the comfort
of the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library at 5 a.m.
On Oct. 1, the UGLi will
become accessible 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Ste-
phen Griffes, the information
resources supervisor for Uni-
versity libraries, said the deci-
sion was made in response to
years worth of requests from
students to extend the hours.
"The students have been ask-
ing for 24 hours for a really,
really long time, so we're really

happy to finally be able to do it,"
Griffes said.
The UGLi's current hours of
operation are 8 a.m. to 5 a.m.,
Monday through Friday and 10
a.m. to 5 a.m. on the weekends.
To ensure a smooth transition,
the library is hiring two addi-
tional staff members, Griffes
said.
Lynne Raughley, the inter-
im communications director
for the University's libraries,
said the University has always
been aware of the demand for
increased library access, but
it took time to implement the
change due to the additional
resources needed.
"The library strives in all
ways to meet the needs of stu-
dents in every way that it. can
and I think this is just one of the
things that people feel like they
need," Raughley said. "We're
glad t% finally be able to make it
happen."
Griffes said the UGLi is insti-
tuting its own safety measures

For the Daily
After undergoing months of
renovations, Baits II officially
re-opened to the campus com-
munity on Thursday afternoon.
The University's Board of

Regents approved plans for
reconstruction of the building
last November, and completion
of the project took about four
months, Linda Newman, the
director of University Housing,
said.
Newman commenced Thurs-
day's re-opening ceremony
in the Baits II parking lot by
expressing the excitement of
those who contributed to the
remodeling of the residence
hall.

"We are here to celebrate the
opening of Baits II," Newman
said. "Or, as it's now known,
Baits 2.0."
The renovations include a
new community learning cen-
ter with computer stations and
large monitors capable of video
conferencing. Each house has
also been outfitted with new
kitchens, furniture and lounges
with various themes - includ-
ing a cafe-style performance
room, a piano lounge and an art

studio, along with various music
rooms.
Among the most popular
additions is a movie theater in
Thieme House that boasts a
large projection screen, couch-
es, and chairs, which can seat
roughly 30 students.
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
student affairs, gave a short
speech at the event, in which
she addressed the absence of

Ex-presidential

about the state of
the economy
By STEPHEN YAROS
For the Daily
Though it may have been a
few months since Americans
witnessed the combination of
pizza and politics, the Univer-
sity got a small taste of the duo

on Thursday evening.
Herman Cain, the former
CEO of Godfather's Pizza and a
former Republican presidential
candidate, spoke to an audience
of about 600 students and Ann
Arbor residents on Thursday
night at the Power Center. His
appearance was part of the
30-city College Truth Tour -
a bipartisan effort focused on
informing students about the
state of the economy. He also
visited Central Michigan Uni-
versity and Michigan State Uni-
versity this week.

The crowd remained
engaged during the event, and
cheered and jeered at Cain
throughout the evening, chant-
ing things such as "9-9-9" - in
reference to his proposed tax
policy plan that called for a
9-percent personal income tax,
9-percent business transaction
tax and 9-percent federal sales
tax -"Cain-train" and "pizza-

Despite the distractions,
he focused on what he said he

J.K. Rowling's first novel since
'Harry Potter' hits bookstores

BEATRICE RICHARDSON/AP
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stand next to an artist rendering of a pro-
posed Ferris wheel during a news conference on the Staten Island boroughof New York on Thursday.
World's largest Ferris wheel
to be built on Staten Island

Developers hope
$230 million
attraction will
bring tourists
NEW YORK (AP) - The Big
Apple is getting another "big-
gest": the world's tallest Fer-
ris wheel, part of an ambitious
plan to draw New Yorkers and
tourists alike to the city's so-
called "forgotten borough."
The 625-foot-tall, $230 mil-
lion New York Wheel is to grace
a spot in Staten Island over-
looking the 305-foot-tall Statue
of Liberty and the downtown
Manhattan skyline, offering a
singular view as it sweeps high-
er than other big wheels like
the Singapore Flyer, the Lon-
don Eye and a "High Roller"
planned for Las Vegas.
Designed to carry 1,440 pas-
sengers at a time, it's expected
to draw 4.5 million people a
year to a setting that also would
include a 100-shop outlet mall
and a 200-room hotel.

It will be "an attraction
unlike any other in New York
City - in fact, it will be, we
think, unlike any other on the
planet," Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg said as he unveiled the
plans against the backdrop of
New York Harbor. While the
privately financed project faces
various reviews, officials hope
to have the wheel turning by
the end of 2015.
The wheel would put Staten
Island on the map of superla-
tives in a place where "biggest"
is almost an expectation - home
to the nation's biggest city popu-
lation, busiest mass-transit sys-
tem, even the biggest Applebee's
restaurant.
The attraction stands to
change the profile of the least
populous and most remote of the
city's five boroughs, a sometime
municipal underdog that has
taken insults from New Jersey
and was once known for having
the world'slargest ... landfill.
"It's going to be a real icon.
The Ferris wheel will be Stat-
en Island's Eiffel Tower," Sen
Charles Schumer enthused.

As a visible addition to the
skyline around the harbor, the
wheel "gives Staten Island an
identity beyond its role as a
suburban community," while
letting it tap into the stream of
tourist money in a city that drew
50.9 million visitors last year,
said Mitchell Moss, a New York
University urban policy profes-
sor.
The project is expected to
bring $500 million in private
investment and 1,100 permanent
jobs to the borough's St. George
waterfront, and the developers
will pay the city $2.5 million a
year in rent for the land.
Staten Island isn't entirely off
the tourist map. Its free ferry
is the city's third-largest tour-
ist attraction, carrying an esti-
mated 2 million visitors a year
alongside millions of residents,
officials say.
But the city has long strug-
gled to entice tourists off the
boat and into Staten Island.
Much-touted Staten Island
sightseeing bus tours fizzled
within a year in 2009 for lack of
ridership.

'The Casual
Vacancy' delves
into adult world of
dirty politics, death
LONDON (AP) - After
months of hype and anticipa-
tion, J.K. Rowling's first novel
for adults has appeared, swept
into the arms of'hopeful book-
sellers and an army of grown-up
Harry Potter fans eager to find
out what his creator has done
next.
A gritty and darkly humorous
tale of ugly realities in a pretty
English village, "The Casual
Vacancy" seems a long way
from the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, and
reviewers gave it a mixed recep-
tion. But Rowling said Thursday
she wasn't worried about the
response.
"I've had my books burnt,"
said the author, whose magi-
cal stories were condemned
as Satanist by some Christian
groups. "I've got quite a way to
go to upset people that much
with 'A Casual Vacancy."'
A story of ambition, envy and
rivalry, the novel recounts the
civic warfare sparked in the fic-
tional Pagford when the unex-
pected death of a town official
leaves a vacancy on the govern-
ing body. Characters set on a
collision course range from the
affluent lawyer Miles Mollison
to the Weedons, a ramshackle
clan living in The Fields, the
run-down housing project on
the edge of town.
Rowling told a 1,000-strong
audience at London's Southbank
Centre that the idea for the book
- "Local election sabotaged by
teenagers, basically" - came to
her on a plane several years ago.
Writing for a more adult read-
ership, she said, had been "free-
ing" - though "in other senses
it's a challenging book," told
from multiple viewpoints.
Rowling said the book's focus
on teenagers, the heart of Pag-
ford and of the novel, was not a

million miles from her previous
work - although these troubled
and profane youngsters are "not
Harry, Ron and Hermione."
"They are very different teen-
agers," Rowling said. "They are
contemporary teenagers."
The book's sex and swearing
have drawn the most comment
so far - some audience mem-
bers were startled to hear the
F-word pass Rowling's lips dur-
ing Thursday's reading. But the
presence of death is perhaps the
book's most adult element, and
one that loomed over Harry Pot-
tei s world, too.
Death obsesses me," Rowling
said. "I can't understand why it
doesn't obsess everyone. Think
it does. I'm just a little more
'out."'
Five years after the last Pot-
ter book appeared, Rowling
remains the world's most suc-
cessful living writer.' The lines
were shorter and the wizard
costumes missing, but "The
Casual Vacancy" appeared to
some of the same fanfare that

greeted each Potter tome, with
stores wheeling out crates of
the books precisely at 8 a.m. as
part of a finely honed marketing
strategy.
And Rowling retains the
intense loyalty of Potter fans.
In contrast to the tight security
that preceded the book's release,
the atmosphere at Thursday'
reading was warm; it felt like a
reunion. Several audience mem-
bers asked Potter-related ques-
tions, which Rowling answered
at length. One young man, wear-
ing a "Rowling is our Queen"
I shirt, asked if her could give
her a present. Rowling accepted
it graciously.
Many in the crowd were
young adults who had grown up
on Harry Potter and we keen to
follow her wherever she wanted
to go.
"She's been such an inspira-
tion to everyone," said 18-year-
old university student Milly
Anderson. "She's not just influ-
enced people's childhoods -
she's molded them."

DETROIT -
Detroit corruption
case widens scope
Michigan's former state budget
director told jurors Thursday that
she was "angry" when she learned
that public grants approved in
2000 at the urging of Kwame Kil-
patrick ended up in the hands of
the former mayor's wife.
Kilpatrick is on trial for
alleged corruption, mostly com-
mitted at City Hall from 2002
through 2008, but federal prose-
cutors turned the clock back fur-
ther to show questionable deals
from when he was a Democratic
leader in the Michigan House.
* Kilpatrick was able to get
grant money for Detroit nonprof-
it groups when lawmakers passed
a budget for arts and community
projects in 2000. The government
alleges that $37,500 of it was even-
tually passed from a neighborhood
group to Kilpatrick's wife, Carlita
Kilpatrick. In 2001, state officials
wanted to know more about how
the money was spent.

An actor whose character died
a violent death on the TV drama
"Sons of Anarchy" plunged to his

Johnny Lewis, who played Kip

Wednesday morning after neigh-
bors reported a woman scream-
ing inside the home, Cmdr.

Lewis' death ended in a turbu-
lent nearly 10-month span during
which he was repeatedly arrested
and officials expressed concerns
about his mental health and the
danger he posed to others.

Anti-Muslim film

A federal judge on Thursday

because he is a flight risk.
U.S. Central District Chief
Magistrate Judge Suzanne Segal

he violated his probation term for

A federal prosecutor said
Nakoulahad eight probationviola-
tions, including lying to his proba-

After his 2010 conviction,
Nakoula was sentenced to 21

months in prison and was barred
from using omputers or the Inter-
net for five years without approval
from his probation officer.
UNITED NATIONS
Syrian army sends
ominous text to
rebel fighters
Cellphones in Syria rang,
buzzed and chirped Thursday
with an ominous text message
from the military to members of
the armed rebellion: "Game over."
The rebels provided their own
response to the regime's warn-
ing *to surrender and disarm by
launching new attacks to drive
government troops out of the larg-
est city of Aleppo.
There's no indication that the
stalemated civil war has taken
a decisive turn in any direction,
however, and the bloodshed that
has already claimed more than
30,000 lives looks likelyto dragon
for many more months.
Compounding the grim out-
look, sharp disagreements
between Syria's foreign friends
and foes - on display at the U.N.
General Assembly this week -
have prevented a diplomatic solu-
tion from taking shape.

Rom-ney I..attacks Obama
over military budget cuts'

Romney seeks to
reverse declining
support in wake of
"secret" videotape
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP)
- President Barack Obama
pledged to create many more
jobs and "make the middle class
secure again" in a campaign-
closing appeal on Thursday -
more than five weeks before
Election Day - to voters already
casting ballots in large numbers.
Republican Mitt Romney,
focusing on threats beyond
American shores, accused the
commander in chief of back-
ing dangerous cuts in defense
spending.
"The idea of cutting our mili-
tary is unthinkable and dev-
astating. And when I become
president we will not," declared
the challenger, struggling to
reverse a slide in opinion polls.
Romney and Obama cam-
paigned a few hundred miles
apart in Virginia, 40 days before
their long race ends. They'll be
in much closer quarters next
Wednesday in Denver - for
the first of three presidential
debates on the campaign cal-
endar and perhaps the chal-
lenger's best remaining chance
to change the trajectory of the
campaign.
In a race where the economy
is the dominant issue, there was
afresh sign ofnational weakness
as the Commerce Department
lowered its earlier estimate of
tepid growth last spring. Rom-
ney and his allies seized on the
news as evidence that Obama's
policies aren't working.
There was good news for the

president in the form of a survey
by The Washington Post and
Kaiser Family Foundation sug-
gesting he has gained ground
among older voters after a
month-long ad war over Repub-
lican plans for Medicare.
The pace also was quickening
in the struggle for control of the
U.S. Senate.
Prominent Republican con-
servatives pledged financial and
political support for Rep. Todd
Akin in Missouri. That compli-
cated Democratic Sen. Claire
McCaskill's bid for re-election.
But it also left Romney, running
mate Paul Ryan and the rest of
the GOP hierarchy in an awk-
ward position after they tried
unsuccessfully to push Akin off
the ballot in the wake of his con-
troversial comments about rape.
Farther west, in Arizona,
Republican Rep. Jeff Flake
unleashed an ad calling Demo-
cratic rival Richard Carmona
"Barack Obama's rubberstamp."
It was not meant as a compli-
ment in a state seemingly head-
ed Romney's way, a response for
sure to Democratic claims that
the Senate contest was unex-
pectedly close.
In the presidential race, early
voting has already begun in Vir-
ginia as well as South Dakota,
Idaho and Vermont. It began
during the day in Wyoming as
well as in Iowa, like Virginia
one of the most highly contested
states. Early voters had formed
a line a half block long in Des
Moines before the elections
office opened at 8 a.m.
Campaigning in Virginia
Beach, Obama said, "It's time
for a new economic patriotism,
an economic patriotism rooted
in the belief that growing our
economy begins with a strong

and thriving middle class." It
was a line straight from the
two-minute television commer-
cial his campaign released over-
night.
He said that if re-elected he
would back policies to create
a million new manufacturing
jobs, help businesses double
exports and give tax breaks to
companies that "invest in Amer-
ica, not ship jobs overseas." He
pledged to cut oil imports in half
while doubling the fuel efficien-
cy of cars and trucks, make sure
there are 100,000 new teachers
trained in math and science, cut
the growth of college tuition in
half and expand student aid "so
more Americans can afford it."
He also touted a "balanced
plan to reduce the deficit by $4
trillion," but he included $1 tril-
lion in reductions that already
have taken place, and he took
credit for saving half of the
funds budgeted for the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan that no
longer are needed.
Obama also said he would
"ask the wealthy to pay a little
more," a reference to the tax
increase he favors on incomes
over $200,000 for individuals
and $250,000 for couples. It is
perhaps his most fundamental
disagreement on policy with
Romney, who wants to extend
expiring tax cuts at all levels,
including the highest.
Obama's campaign put out
a second, scathing commer-
cial during the day based on
Romney's recorded comments
from last May that 47 percent
of Americans don't pay income
taxes and feel they are victims
entitled to government benefits.
Romney added that as a candi-
date his job is not to worry about
them.

Netanyahu shows
cartoon-like bomb
to emphasize point'
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- In his most detailed plea to
date for global action against
Iran's nuclear program, Israe-
li Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Thursday the
world has until next summer at
the latest to stop Iran before it
can build a nuclear bomb.
Netanyahu flashed a dia-
gram of a cartoon-like bomb
before the U.N. General Assem-
bly showing the progress Iran
has made, saying it has already
completed the first stage of ura-
nium enrichment.
Then he pulled out a red
marker and drew a line across
what he said was a threshold
Irangwas approachingandwhih
Israel could not tolerate - the
completion of the second stage
and 90 percent of the way to the
uranium enrichment needed to
make an atomic bomb.
"By next spring, at most by
next summer at current enrich-
ment rates, they will have fin-
ished the medium enrichment
and move on to the final stage,"
he said: "From there, it's only
a few months, possibly a few'
weeks before they get enough
enriched uranium for the first
bomb."
Israel considers a nuclear-
armed Iran to be an existential
threat, citing Iranian denials
of the Holocaust, its calls for
Israel's destruction, its devel-
opment of missiles capable of
striking the Jewish state and its
support for hostile Arab mili-
tant groups.
Neither the U.S. nor any of its
international partners are ready
to abandon diplomacy in favor
of military or other actions to
resolve the decade-long stand-
off over Iran's nuclear program.
On Thursday, six world pow-
ers decided to lay the ground-
work for another round of

negotiations with Iran, a senior
U.S. official said, but they want
a significantly improved offer
from the Islamic republic.
The new hope for negotiated
end came after U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham iClin-
ton met with the foreign min-
isters of Britain, China, France,
Germany and Russia - powers
that have sought, over several
rounds of talks, to persuade
Iran to halt its production of
material that could be used in
nuclear weapons.
The latest stab at a diplomat-
ic compromise collapsed this
summer after Iran proposed to
stop producing higher-enriched
uranium in exchange for a sus-
pension in international sanc-
tions, which Clinton has termed
a "nonstarter." The U.S. official
said Iran would have to bring a
murl3 better offer to the table
this,'!time, but stressed that
nations wereseeing some signs
for optimism and that diploma-
cy remained "far and away the
preferred way to deal with this
issue."
No date was set for the possi-
ble resumption of the so-called
P5+1 talks with Iran, said the
U.S. official, who spoke on con-
dition of anonymity because she
wasn't authorized to comment
publicly about the closed-doors
meeting at the United Nations.
After looking for a diplomatic
solution there, Clinton met later
Thursday with Netanyahu at a
New York hotel where she was
expected to hear the alternative
argument for possible military
action.
Their face-to-face occurred
just hours after the Israeli pre-
sented his case to the world
just why a nuclear armed Iran
would be a danger to many
countries.
Casting the battle as one
between modernity and the
"medieval forces of radical
Islam," Netanyahu said deter-
rence would not work against
Iran as it had with the Soviet
Union.

Abbas lambasts Israel
over East Jerusalem

Venezuelan ruler loses support
among once faithful lower classes

Chavez maintains
narrow majority in
opinion polling 4
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Liliana Carias used to hope
President Hugo Chavez would
change her life. Not anymore.
She's been living for years in a
dirt-floor shack without running
water, and aftervotingfor Chavez
in the last three presidential elec-
tions, the single mother of four
said she's tired of waiting for help.
She was among thousands
of people who cheered for the
president's rival recently in the
serpentine streets of Caracas'
Petare slum, which used to be
a bastion of support for Chavez.
She held out a handwritten let-
ter addressed to "My future
President Henrique Capriles,"
the opposition challenger, writ-
ing that her salary as a super-
market cashier was no longer
enough to support her family
and she was worried her land-
lord would evict them.
"We need change," Carias
said as the drum-beating cara-
van paraded by. "I thought it
would come with Chavez but

I'mvery disappointed. He prom-
ised us everything but nothing
changed. I still don't have run-
ning water, sewer or electricity."
From single mothers to con-
struction workers, some Chavez
supporters have been turning
away from the president to con-
sider new leadership. They've
become key to the Oct. 7presiden-
tial vote and Capriles' strategy.
Surveys don't indicate
exactly which "Chavistas" are
becoming "Caprilistas," but the
group appears to include work-
ing-class and lower-middle-
class Venezuelans. Polls also
reveal weariness over a grow-
ing yet troubled economy, 18
percent inflation and one of the
world's highest murder rates.
Despite billions of dollars
in government spending on
social programs, solutions to
problems such as the country's
severe housing shortage have
been elusive. Slums have grown
during Chavez's presidency,
and the government's construc-
tion of new housing projects
hasn't kept up with the legions
of poor people like Carias who
have applied for apartments and
ended up waiting for years.
Now Chavez is spending heav-

ily building apartments and pay-
ing out more benefits to poor
families. But some in the working
class still complain that they're
beingbypassed andhavelost faith
in the government's promises.
Chavez held a 10-point
lead over Capriles in a survey
released this week by the Vene-
zuelan polling firm Datanalisis.
But the 49 percent who said they
intend to vote for Chavez was
dramatically lower than the 63
percent who re-elected him in
2006. The latest poll said 11 per-
cent of those interviewed didn't
reveal a preference.
A survey by the Venezuelan
polling firm Consultores 21 put,
the two candidates roughly
even, with 46.5 percent saying
they would vote for Capriles
and nearly 46 percent saying
they would vote for Chavez.
The poll questioned 1,500peo-
ple Sept. 7-18 and had an error
margin of 3 percentage points.
It also included a second ques-
tion, in which people were asked
to mark their choice in secret, in
case they didn't want to reveal
their preference to the pollster.
Under that method, Capriles had
almost 49 percent and Chavez
just under 46 percent.

Calls settlements
'ethnic cleansing'
in disputed city
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Palestinian President Mah-
moud Abbas accused Israel of
ethnic cleansing Thursday for
building settlements in east
Jerusalem.
"It is a campaign of ethnic
cleansing against the Palestin-
ian people via the demolition
of their homes," Abbas said in
his speech to the U.N. General
Assembly.
Shortly after, Israel Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanya-
hu rebuked Abbas in his own
address to the assembly.
"We won't solve our conflict
with libelous speeches at the
U.N.," Netanyahu said.
Israel conquered the eastern
part of Jerusalem from Jordan
during the 1967 Mideast War.
It later annexed it but the move
has not been internationally
recognized. The Palestinians
want east Jerusalem to the
capital of their future state in
the West Bank.
Abbas also said he has
opened talks on a new bid for
international recognition at
the U.N., but didn't specify
exactly when he will ask the
General Assembly to vote.
"Intensive consultations
with the various regional orga-
nizations and the state mem-
bers" were underway, he said.
The Palestinians will apply
to the General Assembly for
nonmember state status.
That stands in sharp con-
trast to last year, when they
asked the Security Council to
admit them as a full member
state, but the bid failed.
Abbas insisted that the new
quest for recognition was "not
seeking to delegitimize Israel,
but rather establish a state that
should be established: Palestine."

Palestinian officials said
their bid is likely to be submit-
ted on Nov. 29.
Abbas said in a speech to the
assembly that efforts to win
Palestine status as an observer
state - a lower level than last
year's failed bid for recogni-
tion as a full state - were not
intended to pose any threat to
Israel.
"We are not seeking to dele-
gitimize Israel, but rather
establish a state that should be
established: Palestine," Abbas
said.
However, Abbas said he was
"speaking on behalf of an angry
people," who believed they
were not winning their rights
despite adopting a "culture of
peace and international resolu-
tions,
"Israel gets rewarded while
continues the policies of war,
occupation and settlements,"
he said.
Abbas also accused Israel of
seeking to "continue its occu-
pation of East Jerusalem, and
annex vast parts of West Bank
... and refuses to discuss seri-
ously the Palestinian refugees
issue."
He claimed that Israeli
actions threatened to under-
mine the Palestinian Author-
ity to the point "which could
lead to its collapse."
Palestinian officials said
that their bid for recognition
will likely be submitted to
the General Assembly on Nov.
29, after the U.S. presidential
election. Abbas has sought to
avoid entangling the Palestin-
ian statehood bid in U.S. presi-
dential politics.
Appealing to other nations
for their support, Abbas asked
world leaders to help avoid
a new "catastrophe" in Pal-
estine. "Support the estab-
lishment of the free state of
Palestine now, and let peace
win before it's too late," he
-said.

Haze and mirrors
Students and 'U' should keep Greek life safe
As bid week comes to a close and "pledge term" begins for
Greek life, we must turn our attention to the threat of haz-
ing, which will soon confront many prospective members
of these organizations. The University's hazing policy defines it as
"any action or situation, with or without consent of the participants,
which recklessly, intentionally, or unintentionally endangers the
mental, physical, or academic health of a student." In light of the
hazing-related deaths last year at Cornell and Florida A&M Univer-
sities, we need to make sure we are standing up for each other and
preventing hazing at the University of Michigan.

Keep education open 24 7

At Binghamton University in New York, all
Greek institutions were suspended from pledg-
ing and inducting new members due to a hazing
scandal last year. Students' friends and families
reported the heinous activities the men were
expected to participate in to school administra-
tors. Last year, two national sororities canceled
their chapters at Binghamton after a review of
the Greek culture on campus. Greek life makes
up 10 percent of the student population at Bing-
hamton, compared to approximately20 percent
here at Michigan.
Universities across the country need to pre-
vent hazing to their greatest effort. At Michi-
gan, the Hazing Task Force takes "a firm stance
against hazing violations" within the Greek
community. The members investigate hazing
complaints and report to the University's Office
of Student Conflict Resolution. The offending
fraternity is subject to probation, suspension or
a sweeping ban if found to have engaged in haz-
ing. The involved members can be suspended or
expelled from the University. Additionally, the
state of Michigan enacted an anti-hazing law in
2004, threatening those accused of hazing with
legal actions, including jail time.
While these reprimands are deterrents to
those who haze, kicking an organization off

campus or expelling certain members is not
comprehensive enough. These actions do not
reform hazing cultures of hazing, since they
only administer punishments on a case-by-case
basis. There is a mindset within the university
setting that fosters hazing behaviors. Some
may contend that these behaviors are an inte-
gral part of Greek culture and that one should
simply avoid the pledge process if they don't
wish to be subjected to hazing. According to
manystate governments with laws against haz-
ing, however, a victim's "consent" is not truly
"consent" due to the presence of peer pressure.
There should not be any negative stigma asso-
ciated with dropping out of a fraternity due to
hazing. Rather, students should stand up for
themselves and for their friends.
During the first week of October, the Univer-
sity will observe National Hazing Prevention
Week to "educate students, parents, faculty
and staff so that they can more easily recognize
hazing." On Oct. 5, students will wear black
and can pick up a maroon ribbon at a table on
the Diag in support of hazing prevention. This
gesture is a great form of awareness but is not
enough to end hazing. We must be aware of
hazing, work further to prevent it, and not be
afraid to speak out.

it's hard to describe the feel-
ing you get when you wake up
early. I mean really early, like
not before your
classes start (at
noon), but before
even the earli-
est classes in thei< x
University (more
like 8:30 am.).
Since many of
my fellow under- MICHAEL
grads may not SMALLEGAN
have experienced
this in a while, let
me tryto explain.
Stumbling to the sidewalk with
bleary eyes and a yawn at 6:30 a.m.,
the first thing you notice is not a sin-
gle other beingis awake - except for
the birds and, well, the "real" people
commuting to their jobs and respon-
sibilities. Also you notice that, merci-
fully, the baristas at Espresso Royale
are also awake. Some of them are col-
lege students and I really don't know
how they do it. They must just stay
awake from the night before. At that
moment, stumbling out of Espresso,
beverage in hand, eyes clearing up,
you see the sun starting to peek over
the horizon and you feel - in spite of
yourself - a sense of power, a sense
of a head-start, a sense of being a
leader. This grows inside of you as
you head toward the library (and
the caffeine starts to kick in). Fanta-
sies of finishing the course pack two
months early float around in your
head, and instantly shatter when you
pull the door handle to the library
and it's locked.
The Hatcher Graduate Library
is closed from 2 to 8 a.m. This curi-
ous policy of the University library
system is frustrating on those early
mornings, and not only because I'm
naturally inclined to be grumpy
before mid-afternoon. Surely library
administrators set these hours in
response to the actual usage patterns
of us night-owl undergraduates, but
is this policy in line with what the

University is trying to accomplish?
If we're not the leaders and the
best before we set foot on campus,
the University aims to make it hap-
pen before we exit through the
fountain and march onward to grad-
uation. It's true - it's in Mary Sue's
vision statement.
The content of that statement
helps determine the direction taken
and decisions made by the adminis-
tration on an everyday basis. Curious
then, that some really great words are
not in there to describe the desired
output of the University. "Happy"
or "happiness" isn't in there. Neither
is "healthy," nor is the word "sleep."
Although, admittedly, the University
does "champion...policy research to
advance health, quality of life, and
longevity of our own community."
With that in mind, the Univer-
sity should love this meta-analysis of
sleep research conducted by Franzis
Preckel and others last year. Chro-
notype data from more than 7,500
people showed a positive correlation
between people that prefer evening
time and cognitive intelligence. So
smart people stay up late, and that
would be fantastic if that were the
end of the story. Instead, Preckel and
his team found people that stay up
late have less academic success than
early risers. Another study, con-
ducted by a team at the University of
North Texas found that early risers,
on average, have a full letter grade
over evening-types.
Scientific studies and popular
articles proclaiming the benefits of
a healthy night's sleep have become
so numerous they're hardly worth
citing here. We know (although we
may not yet know the mechanism
by which this happens) that proper
sleep increases cognitive function-
ing, memory tasks and positive
outlook. We also know that sleep
disorders co-occur with numerous
mental and brain disorders, not to
mention obesity. Furthermore, the
National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration tells us that sleep
deprivation contributes to 100,000
accidents each year and most of
these occur between midnight and
2 a.m. and 4 and 6 a.m. While no
one is operating a vehicle in the
Hatcher Grad, how much effective
studying can be going on there dur-
ing that time?
Night owls may
be smart, but the
early birds get
the grades.
Library administrators took a
step in the right direction today with
the announcement that the Shapirra
Undergraduate Library will soon be
open 24 hours a day. However, aside
from the Duderstadt Center (conve-
niently located on North Campus),
this is the only University library
with this luxury. Certainly, the Uni-
versity administration mustg always
strive to strike a balance between
reacting to the habits of the com-
munity and implementing paternal-
istic policy. The presence of smokers
.on the Diag didn't step the campus
ban on smoking, yet the evidence of
the benefits of proper sleep-wake
cycles is almost as robust as the evi-
dence arrayed against nicotine. If
the libraries are going to continue
to allow for inefficiency and damag-
ing student sleep habits, at the very
least they shouldn't stand in the way
of students who're embodying the
"leaders and best" mantra by getting
a head start on their day.

Myth busters: ER edition

VANESSA RYCHLINSKI I
Get your platform straight, Mitt

it's 10:35 p.m. the night of Michigan's
win against Massachusetts. The ambu-
lance is just leaving our sidewalk and
that feeling of helpless fear
starts to set in. No, Mom,
it's not me in the back of
that ambulance, but I am
about to make my first trip
to the University Hospi-
tal's Emergency Room to
support my friend. My
vision of an emergency
room rested somewhere TIMOTHY
between an episode of BURROUGHS
"House" and the wait-
ing room of a DMV. Upon
arrival, I realized those two stereotypes were
far from the truth, and I gained a new level of
respect and admiration for the professional-
ism and kindness that I witnessed.
Long wait times at ERs are no secret. A
CNN article placed the average U.S. ER wait
time at about six hours, but most other news
sources report the time closer to four hours.
Lucky for me (or unlucky for my friend) our
emergency was so urgent that he sawa doctor
immediately. After sitting down, the cause of
the absurdly long waits became obvious - not
all emergencies are created equal. Head, neck
or back injuries and anything involving blood
takes precedent. An individual who arrived
before us was still waiting to see a doctor for
her sprained ankle when we left six hours
later. The receptionist probably should have
taken the tough-love approach and told her to
put some frozen broccoli on it and make an
appointment at UHS. This type of emergency
visit is what creates these absurd wait-time
statistics. If you were to take her six-hour
wait to see a doctor and our zero-hour wait
and average it, you'd still report an average
wait time of three hours. Anyone can tell this
extremely misleading statistic gives emer-
gency rooms an undeserved bad rap.
Another common issue many ERs run
into is overcrowding. Packed waiting rooms,
beds in hallways and multiple roommates
are all typical hospital problems. The Uni-
versity Hospital has greatly benefited from
a $17.7-million renovation of the ER, which
was completed last April. The project added

extra patient beds and a newly renovated
waiting room. Jennifer Holmes, the director
of operations for the emergency department,
claims the goal of the improvements wasto
cut wait times down to between 30 and 45
minutes. That's a considerably lower range
than those projected at other hospitals. The
new waiting room, where I spent the major-
ity of my time, was as spacious and com-
fortable as a hospital can be. To be honest,
I spent most of the wait watching the Notre
Dame versus Michigan State game on one of
the emergency room's new flat screens - in
other words, it could've been worse. Obvi-
ously, sitting in a hospital waiting room is
never fun, but it wasn't the claustrophobic,
baby-crying experience I expected.
The aspect of the entire evening that made
the biggest impression by far was the hos-
pital staff. The receptionists were friendly
and helpful and kept me updated on my
friend's condition. (Also, one of the front desk
employees loaned me a few bucks to get a
snack at the vending machine since I some-
how managed to bring only $1.16 to the emer-
gency room.) While my friend went to get a
MRI, the nurse tried to keep me busy. He sug-
gested that I have fresh clothes and maybe an
iPod brought to the hospital for the rest of the
wait. Anyone who's had that feeling of help-
lessness you get at a hospital knows there's no
better cure than that simple task that makes
you feel useful. When my friend and I did
have a chance to talk with the doctor, he was
informative and had us out of the hospital as
fast as he could. The staff, even after possibly
one of their busiest days of the year (Football
Saturday), was still friendly and professional.
Not only am I sure that this was comfort-
ing to my friend, but it also helped me be the
calming, positive presence that he needed.
Knowing we have a resource like the Uni-
versity's ER should be a comfort to every stu-
dent on campus. Our parents should sleep a
little easier as well. After my visit to the ER,
I know in a time of need, helping hands will
be there, extended by a team of professional
staffers who work tirelessly to keep us safe.

TOLEDO, OH - On my way to the
nearest stop on the Romney-Ryan
bus tour on Sept. 26, I figured I could
predict many details of the event. I
wasn't disappointed. A light board
proclaimed the $16-trillion national
debt in sickly green while flashing an
estimated financial burden per citi-
zen - a staggering $142,000. Look-
ing around the SeaGate Convention
Center, I wondered what my fellow
rally-goers - mostly white, mostly
middle-aged - were thinking.
The average-Joe demographic was
the most predictable feature of the
entire spectacle. Ohioans know all
about being in the middle. The state
was won by President Obama in 2008
but wentto President Bush in the two
elections previous. At the rally yes-
terday, the homogenous Midwestern
audience milled about, celebrating
the party they believe will protect
their average lifestyles. Come Elec-
tion Day, most of these people will
be concerned with the economy and
their own freedoms and indepen-
dence. Romney's economic plan is
composed of five parts that run the
gamut from energy independence to
American exports to blue-collar job
creation. During his speech, he effec-
tively touched the pressure points
rankling Middle Americans most:
the gas pump, China, joblessness and
the national debt. He claimed that
his tax proposal alone would quickly
generate 7-million jobs, and prom-
ised S million more by 2016. He ges-
tured to the light board, lamenting
the $6 trillion added to the national
deficit during Obama's term.
Looking at the audience, it didn't
take too long to identify "average
Americans" - families, kissing
couples, members of the Air Force,
boy scouts and wounded war veter-
ans - conservative Americans. Do
modern Democrats and Republicans
truly advocate for the proper defi-
nitions of liberalism and conserva-
tism? Republicans are supposed to
be conservative = meaning, fiscally
and socially. But I wonder where the
social portion of modern GOP policy

lies. Mitt Romney stated on Wednes-
day: "No nation on earth is as chari-
table as the people of the United
States of America." Americans are
"a compassionate people" who ought
to take care of their own by finding
jobs for the jobless. In an attempt to
defuse and interpret his infamous
"47 percent" comments, Romney
invoked compassionate conserva-
tism as a catalyst to help so-called
"dependents" reach independence.
Perhaps the biggest complaint
against Romney is that he isn't
down-to-earth, too big business
- the leaked fundraiser video cer-
tainly underscores this argument.
The media seized on this sound bite
along with several others (Todd
Akin, anyone?) to emphasize what
many Obama supporters believe -
that the GOP is out-of-touch with
social issues, that it's the party of
wealthy special interests, human-
like corporations and women-hat-
ers. The GOP doesn't care about
civil rights - just ask Ann Coul-
ter. But conservatism didn't always
mean lack of social reform; in fact,
it traditionally devoted itself to a
basic standard of ethics on which to
build a free, American society. New
York Times columnist David Brooks
makes the distinction between "eco-
nomic" and "traditional" conserva-
tives - the former are advocates
of the free-market while the latter
wished to reform society accord-
ing to certain ethics and at a mea-
sured and judicious pace. Brooks
raises a great point - that modern
conservatism today is all business.
The phrase "small business owner"
constantly creeps into the political
rhetoric of the GOP - step four of
Governor Romney's economic plan
is dedicated exclusively to promot-
ing such enterprises.
The GOP is historically respon-
sible for considerable social good.
The Republican Party stopped slav-
ery under Abraham Lincoln. It's
responsible for the Sherman Act,
which busted trusts and monopo-
lies. Conservative Republicans and

Democrats worked together in Con-
gress during the Second New Deal
to stop programs deemed socialistic,
such as the Resettlement Adminis-
tration - an agency that moved poor
rural families at the government's
whim. Republicans pushed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 into passage. The
darling of Republican conservatism,
Ronald Reagan, halted the recession
in the early 1980s by creating 16-mil-
lion jobs, and his two terms are often
remembered for their tax-cuts, low-
ered inflation and the support of
working-class former Democrats.
Romney stated on Wedhesdaythat
if he's elected he'll repeal the Afford-
able Care Act, dubbed "Obamacare,"
and riffed on Medicare's similari-
ties to European socialist systems
("Europe doesn't work' in Europe,"
he quipped to an amused audience).
Medicare does verge on socialist,
but Romney misses the point. The
Republican party should want to
reform healthcare as well, but in a
careful way that fits with American
society's demands and the moral val-
ues that guided the GOP in the past.
In Bowling Green on Wednesday,
Obama spun the auto industry's sta-
tus as a success, and made the sup-
posed reduction of student loans
a bragging point. Both claims are
dubious since the industry has exri-
enced a resurgence at the cost of mil-
lions of dollars to future taxpayers
and student debt is over $1 trillion
while students are business default-
ing at almost twice the rate claimed
by the government. He called those
middle-of-the road Midwestern-
ers "hard-working [people]" not "a
bunch of victims." Though Romney
has attempted to speak to the middle
class and low-income families, it's
uncertain whether his push in Ohio
- a state that epitomizes the mid-
dle-of-the road mindset in its voting
record and demographic -will be
enough to win him the state's crucial
electoral votes.

Silent storvtelling

New magazine for 'U'

Prolific director Ozu
brings vintage film
art to the University
ByJOHNBOHN
Daily Arts Writer
During cinema's infancy,
there existed across the globe
a performance profession that
has become all
but extinct. It Silent Ozu:
complicated Fall Film'

in a silent film. 9, at 7p.m.
This profes- Natural
sion was the Science
narrator-lec- Auditorum
turer.
With the Free
invention of
cinematic storytelling techniques
such as cross-cuts and close
ups - and later with the advent
of the "talkies" - these narra-
tors became obsolete, except in
certain immigrant communities
where they acted as translators.
Yet in Japan, the tradition was
extremely popular. These narra-
tors were called benshi, and they
did everything from providing
background information to per-
forming every character in the
film, be it man, woman or child.
"They were so popular that
people would often decide which
film to go to based on the ben-
shi and not the film," said Abe
Markus Nornes, a Prof. of Asian
Cinema.
Nornes specializes in Japa-
nese cinema, and this semester
he's organized a film series on
the great Japanese filmmaker
Yasujiro Ozu. The series, which
mostly involves silent films, will
include a professional benshi, Ich-
iro Kataoka a singular experi
enge in itself.
Now in his thirties, Kataoka
has been studying the art of the
benshi for a decade now. He has
narrated nearly 200 films, mostly

The Fall Film Series kicked off with a performance at the Michigan.

Japanesebut also American, Ital-
ian, French, Chinese and Korean,
among others. At the University
alone, Kataoke has performed in
a handful of classes.
"One of the classes was on ani-
mation," Nornes said. "The pro-
fessor asked if he could do 'Felix
the Cat,' and he just whipped out
a new script for it and did it."
"This is the first time that any-
one outside Japan has tried to do
this," Nornes said. "These benshi
have gone to international film
festivals for a few days, but never
has anyone come in for half a year
and done a whole film series. It's
totally unique and pretty amaz-
ing."
The project started with a seed
grant from the Center for World
Performance Studies, and then
evolved into a community effort
out of necessity. In addition to liv-
ing expenses for the benshi, the
films themselves are shot on 35
mm film, and require an assort-
ment of live music, all of which
Nornes has organized for the
event. Small donations have come
from many of the departments at
the University, most notably from
the Center for Japanese Studies.
Though Ozu is best known for
directing post-war melodramas,
this series mostly focuses on his
critically acclaimed silent-era
comedies andz in exclusivi frag
ment of an unfinished project..
"One of the most amazing
things is that (Ozu) can appeal
to a regular audience because his
films are so funny," Nornes said.

"But he appeals to makers and
lovers of film because he has a
very strange and unique style."
. Ozu's signature style is marked
by a camera angled upward-from
the ground, said Nornes. There is
also a symmetrical quality to the
film, used in "I Was Born, But... "
that showed during the first week
of the series. It features two kids,
two men and two families.
"It's built in a very formal
way, but there's a craziness and
anarchy to it at the same time,"
Nornes said.
Kataoka will speak Japanese
for performances. During one of
the premiere movies, he actively
translated an American film into
Japanese.
This type of experience has
precedent from a short interlude
in cinema history where sound
was used, but filmmakers didn't
yet know how to add subtitles,
making the viewing of talkies dif-
ficult to send abroad.
"People thought this was the
end of international cinema,"
Nornes said. "In Japan, the benshi
stepped in. They would yell over
the soundtrack."
From now until the end of the
semester, Kataoka will perform
in the Natural Science auditori-
ur. In addition, an assortment of
local musicians and DJ's will help
to recreate the original experi-
ence that Ozu intended for his
films, which range from Steven
Wai iiof the Michigan Theater
playing the organ to a DJ from
WCBN spinning 78s.

By JONATHAN ODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
"What would a women-cen-
tered magazine look like?"
Back in February, the ques-
tion was posed by two students
during a discussion in a Woman's
Psychology lecture. Two months
later, Lizzie Lane, LSA senior and
Haena Kim, LSA junior - along
with the executive board, art-
ists and writers they assembled
around them - put out their
first magazine, a wo-manifesto
answering just that.
"What the F: Your Monthly
Periodical." winner of the 2012
Women's Studies Departpaent's
Feminist Practice Award, is the
first ever woman-centered, femi-
nist publication at the 'U.' Though
they're as new as they are ground-
breaking, the entire staff has their
eyes set for big things in the com-
ing academic year.
"It's really amazing how well
and fast things came together,"
said Lane, now co-president and
Editor in chief of the magazine.
"Especially since we all came into
this project without any experi-
ence in publication. All we had
was a passion for women's health."
But what about the veritable
glut of magazines that already
categorize themselves as woman's
health?
"Most woman's magazines
today are not woman-centered,
they're him-centered or sexually
centered and rely on stereotypes,
but they never portray a complete
picture of womanhood," Lane
said. "But the problem is also in
target demographics, which are
almost exclusively white, upper-
class, educated and heterosexual.
It's just too narrow a definition of
womanhood - it isn't real."
Instead of selling a packaged
ideal of womanhood, "What the
F" is an inclusive invitation to
a conversation, by women, for
womnen.
Vse're trying to spread femi-
ism to the masses - it's our goal,
but we're not a crusading feminist
publication that is in your face
with an agenda," said Jen Spears,
co-president for "What the F."
"Rather, we're trying to reach
women who don't necessarily call
themselves feminists, who find
that the material in the magazine
resonates with them."
Too often, Spears and Lane
explained, feminism is dismissed
as an exclusionary movement, ste-
reotyped as angry and man-hat-
ing, but this image is completely
misconstrued. And "What the F"
is here to change that.
"For example, this October
we're doing a spread on presiden-
tial candidates and their platforms
on woman's health issues," Spears
said. "But because we work to

experience that draws on some of
the best elements from the genre.
Set several years past the end
of the original, "Torchlight II"
pits players against hordes of

Mikulak earns namesake gymnastics skill

Pommel horse skill,
the "Mikulak," will
be added to the FIG
Code of Points
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
For junior Sam Mikulak,
becoming the 10th Michigan
men's gymnast ever to partici-
pate in the Olympics just wasn't
enough to solidify his name in
the history books.
As of Sept.14, Mikulak's name
is permanently in the books, just
as planned.
The International Gymnas-
tics Federation released its Code
of Points two weeks ago, with
the "Mikulak" as one of three
pommel horse skills named
after gymnasts.
The "Mikulak" is a double-
scissor travel with a sideways
hop from one end of the horse to
the other, and is a 'D' skill on the
scale from A to F, with F being
the most difficult. It is one of the
most difficult scissor skills on
the pommel horse, as no other
scissor skills have a rating high-
er than D.
"When I first invented the
skill, which was a year ago, it
was more of just a battle to make
sure no one saw it and tried
competing it on a world stage,"
Mikulak said.
"I survived that, and when I
went to the Olympics, we regis-
tered for a submission of a new
skill."
Mikulak knew that he'd be
competing the skill on the pom-

tics Championship in Tokyo, but
he suffered an ankle injury and
wasn't 'able to compete. Now,
the parallel bars skill has been
dubbed the "Sasaki."
But that setback didn't upset
Mikulak at all, he said.
Last November, Mikulak
began developing his new skill
on the pommel horse. He said*
he knew that he was improv-
ing at pommel horse - an event
he would have to compete well
on to make the'Olympic team
- so he took a simpler skill and
"amped it up," adding an addi-
tional move to make it his own.
"It's nice I could
get my name in
the books for
real this time."

Junior gymnast Sam Mikulak practices in Ann Arbor in late July, just before he left for London to participate in the 2012 London Olympics.

mel horse for Team USA during
the men's qualification round
at the 2012 London Olympics,
so he had to complete the skills
with no flaws.
"I went out, competed it, and I
didn't fall on it, which was good,
because if I had, it wouldn't be
my skill," he said. "I was told
once I competed it, it was pretty
much officially my skill. Once

it finally was announced that
it was going to be named after
me, it was more of a relief (and)
excitement that my name is
going to be remembered in the
history books of gymnastics."
But that wasn't the first time
Mikulak tried to have a skill
named after him. He previ-
ously tried to get a parallel bars
skill named after him a year

ago. Mikulak began working on
the skill - a front one-and-a-
quarter to a long hang - in col-
legiate and international events,
but there was another gymnast,
Sergio Sasaki from Brazil, who
saw it performed and started
working on it, as well, some-
thing Mikulak said was "just a
coincidence."

Ranked for the first time
since 2005 and perched atop the
conference standings, the Mich-
igan women's soccer team (3-0
Big Ten, 9-2 overall) will look to
defend home turf against Iowa
and Nebraska this weekend at
the U-M Soccer Complex.
Friday's contest against the
Hawkeyes (2-1, 11-1-0) projects
to be the more difficult matchup.
Iowa streaked through its non-
conference schedule, scoring 30
goals and allowing just three.
Upon climbing into the national
polls at No. 25, the Hawkeyes
lost their first Big Ten contest to
Illinois - Iowa's only blemish so
far this season, as it rebounded
to win its next two conference
games.
Nebraska (2-1, 5-5-1) hasn't
experienced the same suc-
cess this year but is markedly
improved. The Cornhuskers
emerged from non-conference
play with a losing record, but
they won two of their first three
Big Ten games with their only
loss coming in double overtime
against Purdue.
Hosting a pair of unranked
teams this weekend, the Wol-
verines figure to be favored in

both contests. But Michigan
coach Greg Ryan stressed that
national recognition means lit-
tle this early in the season.
"Being ranked 22nd in the
nation doesn't mean you're bet-
ter than your next opponent,"
Ryan said.
Michigan's defense, which
has surrendered just four goals
all season, will face one of its
toughest matchups of the year
on Friday. Led by fifth-year
senior goalkeeper Haley Kop-
meyer, the Wolverines have
recorded five straight clean
sheets. To continue that streak,
they must slow down a Hawk-
eyes offense that not only leads
the Big Ten in shots, goals, and
victory margin, but has not been
shut out this year.
The back line will have its
hands full with Iowa forward
Cloe Lacasse. After leading the
Hawkeyes in scoring last year
with 12 goals, the sophomore
has already found the back of
the net 11 times this season. Lac-
asse ranks third in the country
in goals and fourth in points per
game (2.33).
The task won't get much eas-
ier against Nebraska. Led by a
talented group of underclass-
men, the Cornhuskers' offense
has taken 30 shots in two dif-

ferent contests. Sophomore
forward Mayme Conroy has
impressed this season with six
goals, and her height - 5-foot-9
- may produce matchup issues
for the Wolverines' relatively
small back line.
Although the Michigan
defense has garnered most of
the attention this fall, junior
forward Nkem Ezurike has
made a name for herself as well.
Ezurike scored five goals in the
Wolverines' first three confer-
ence games and was named the
Big Ten offensive player of the
week. Ryan attributed Ezurike's
fast start to the performance of
the attacking unit as a whole.
"We have a lot of players that
can score goals," Ryan said.
"That actually helps her."
Eleven different players have
scored for the Wolverines this
season.
Ezurike and the Michigan
offense will face a stiff chal-
lenge against Iowa. The Hawk-
eyes' defense has surrendered
just seven goals all season and
features reigning Big Ten co-
freshman of the week Meg
Goodson. But Ryan wasn't too
worried.
"If we play the way we want
to play, the goals will come," he
said.

Against Massachusetts the
week before, Toussaint aver-
aged 5.7 yards per carry, though
his statistics from that game
hold less weight due to the low
quality of competition.
In order to see a 100-yard
rushing game from Toussaint,
he may just need to touch the
ball more.
"Personally, I would like 20
carries a game." Toussaint said.

"But whatever I can get, I can
make the most out of them. I
know that's what I'm best at."
Toussaint has yet to take 20
handoffs in a game this season.
He carried the ball 15 times
against Massachusetts, 13 times
against Notre Dame and just
eight times against Air Force,
when he picked up an abysmal
seven yards throughout the
contest. Over his 10 starts last
season, Toussaint averaged 17.4
carries per game.
Against the Fighting Irish,
senior quarterback Denard Rob-

for most of the rushing attack,
keeping it 26 times and gaining
95 yards.
The coaches know it's wise to
divvy up carries more evenly in
order to keep Robinson healthy
and get Toussaint in a consistent
rhythm. Part of the reason Rob-

Saturday is because Toussaint

will be required to swipe their
MCards upon entrance between
midnight and 7 a.m. He added
the students can also still take
advantage of the Ride Home ser-
vice that runs from 2 to 7 a.m. to
provide free transit back home for
students studying late.
To accommodate for caffeine-
driven students, Bert's Cafd -
located in the lobby of the UGLi
- will soon test out a 24-hour

schedule a few days a week to
see how it's received by students,
according to Bert's manager,
Laura Golze. The caf6 is currently
open until 1 a.m., and Golze said
the trial period could begin as
early as after fall break.
LSA senior Satenig Mirzoyan
said she has been at the UGLi
until 5 a.m. during exam week
and plans to take advantage of the
new extended access.
"The fact that its 24 hours
now means if you are having a
late night or have a paper due
you don't have to go scavenge for
another place to study," Mirzoyan
said.

Mirzoyan also expressed inter-
est in a 24-hour cafe asa means to
fuel her late-night study sessions.
"I think it's a great idea," Golze
said. "I think a lot of students
want to study, especially dur-
ing exam time, so I'm happy that
they're going 24 hours. I think
they should have done this a long
time ago."
LSA sophomore Wayne Lam
said he especially likes the idea of
a 24-hour cafe.
"In the past I've always been
here pretty late studying for
classes," Lam'said. "I think it's
a good idea, but maybe Bert's
could stay a little later also."

dents proposed the idea to medi-
cal school officials at the end of
2010. Along with several faculty
members, the students - Alex-
ander Andrews, Karen Chow,
Lauren Dennisuk, Michael Gao
and Alexandra Pulst-Korenberg
- presented their ideas to Medi-
cal School administrators in the
summer of 2011 as part of their
effort to get the partnership
approved.
Conjeevaram said the benefits
of the clinic are two-fold as it
provides a free health care option
for the nearly 30 percent of Liv-
ingston county residents who
don't have health insurance, and
it also gives students a chance to
give back to the community while

gaining experience in their field.
"It's really important for us to
understand what's happening in
the community and how to help
people who really need help in
terms of being underinsured or
lack of insurance," Conjeevaram
said. We felt that it was very
important for.those needs to be
met."
Conjeevaram added that it's
empowering for students to use
their classroom skills to help
those in need.
"It promotes the sense of vol-
unteerism and what it means to
care for others," Conjeevaram
said. "This can show them that
they are capable of doing any-
thing they would like to in terms
of serving the community."
Gao, one of the medical stu-
dents who started the clinic,
wrote in an e-mail interview that

he thinks the clinic will fulfill the
needs of both patients and stu-
dents.
"I envision our clinic providing
volunteer and leadership oppor-
tunities to interested students and
physicians," Gao wrote. "Medical
care and medical education are
both very limited resources, and
our clinic provides a bit of each."
Chow, another student agreed
and wrote in an e-mail that she
is excited to see the group's ideas
finally come to fruition.
"There is nothing more excit-
ing than forming an idea and
seeing it turn into reality,"
Chow wrote. "Founding a clinic
required self-motivation, seam-
less teamwork, and selling an idea
to administration and community
figures, akin to starting a busi-
ness. These are skills that medical
schools do not teach."

salient political issues in the
country today: the tax code,
energy dependence and go'ern-
ment spending.
During his address, Cain said
the path to achieving success
can only be achieved by follow-
ing a "a zigzag, not a straight
line." He spoke of his humble
beginnings in a small house in
Atlanta, Ga., the hard work his
parents endured to put him and
his brother through school and
the fluctuation of his career.
After detailing his personal
background, Cain discussed
what students can do to improve
the country. Though Cain
refrained from commenting on

the presidential race, he empha-
sized that students need to stay
informed, involved and inspired.
"If you sit on the sidelines and
you think this country's gonna
get back on the right track,
you're sadly mistaken," Cain
said.
Cain added that the students
of today will soon take on the
problems of the future, and that
it will be up to them to make a
difference.
"I'm challenging you to be
part of the solution, and not part
of the problem," Cain said.
Cain said his vision has
already been influenced by his
experiences on the tour. In an
interview after the event, Cain
said the most important thing
he has learned thus far is that
people want to know the truth.

overpowering fear with cour-
age.
"Courage does not mean that
you have fear," he said. "Yes we
had fear, but we were fearless.
Fear is there, but it's not the bar-
rier. It's not the force that keeps
you from action. You act in spite
of the fear."
Lafayette said in the inter-
view that he chose to visit the
University because of its his-
tory of support for civil rights.
He added that he has friends
and knows other activists who
attended the University.
"It's always been thought of
as a place where you would find
a strong interest and support
base for social change," he said.
Lafayette said he expects
students to focus on the points
he made during his lecture and
apply it in the future.
"I have a great expectation
that people are going to ben-
efit with what I've shared with
them and do something with it,"
Lafayette said. "This activism is
one of the images that the Uni-
versity of Michigan has."
On Friday and Saturday,
Lafayette is also scheduled to
hold a civil rights training ses-
sion on Kingian nonviolence
activism, a philosophy advo-
cated for by the King Center
for Nonviolent Social Change,
which was founded by Coretta
Scott King after her husband's
assassination.
LSA senior Rocci Maxwell
attended the lecture and said
she agreed with Lafayette's
sentiments toward youth voter
education.
"People might not vote
because they're not educated
about it," Maxwell said. "If you
start at an age before 18 where
you can learn the process, then
people will be more likely to
vote. Educating people before
the process would be extremely
beneficial."
He added that in the immedi-
ate future, his goal is to become
a media mogul to fight the lib-
eral media bias.
LSA senior Daniel Sterling
said though the crowd may have
appeared negative, Cain han-
dled it well.
"He seemed to really like the
crowd even though everyone
didn't agree in exact terms with
him," Sterling said. "He kind of
used that to his advantage. He
developed a personal connec-
tion with everyone."
LSA senior Shawn Gauden
said Cain's lack of emphasis on
the campaign was noticeable.
"It was interesting that he
didn't really focus on the can-
didate, he was focused on his
vision of success and how to get
there," Gauden said.

if we can't really have an experi-
ence that we feel good aboutthen
we're just not going to have stu-

dents there."
LSA freshman Alec Lybik, a
Baits II resident, expressed satis-
faction with the new complex.
"The renovations are fantas-
tic," Lybik said. "My suitemates
are sophomores and lived here
last year, so they keep telling me
how much better it is."
Engineering junior Chan- o
dramouli Nagarajan, a resident
adviser at Baits II, said the resi-
dence hall has changed signifi-
cantly since he lived there last
year as a community assistant.
"There are a.bunch of new
spaces that help a lot for studying y
and community building," Naga-
rajan said. "I think the students
are definitely more excited this

The security agreement was

Bashir and Kiir spent four days
in an apparent effort to overcome

Kiir said Thursday was a great

Khartoum's fault.
"As to Abyei it is very unfor-

he said. "My government and

called on the African Union to

"We've not ever had (an open-

Harper said. "She said, 'I'll be
thinking about you guys, but I'll
be working hard in Brazil."':
Harper continued to express
her excitement about the renova-
tion, which she said the Univer-
sity administration believes to be
a "major" accomplishment.
* "When I walked through last
summer ... I just kept saying,
'Wow, wow, wow!"' Harper said.
Upon the ceremonial cutting
of the ribbon by Harper and Bri
Dumond, the. Baits II resident
director, a recording of "The Vic-
tors" immediately began playing,
and the crowd began singing in
unison.
After the ceremony, Harper
discussed the University's cur-
rent goals for future residence
hall renovations.
AATA
From Page 1
Board member David Nacht
said while the added expense
would hurt the authority, the
group's attention to spending will
keep the transit system from fal-
tering.

"Our students are so terrific,
and they really deserve won-
derful spaces to study and to be
together," Harper said. "What
we're trying to do is renovate all
of them starting with our heri-
tage halls and including Baits."
Upon the closure of Baits I last
year, University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said the Univer-
sity couldn't justify spending the
$6 million needed to renovate the
residence hall.
"We realized that over the
years, Baits I has not met the
expectation of students ... and
to really upgrade those facilities
would really require a lot more
than $6 million," Logan said last
November. "... It's really difficult
right now at this point to justify
spending a significant amount of
student dollars on infrastructure
and renovation for Baits I."
However, roughly $12 mil-
lion was spent renovating Baits
II, and Harper said the larger
expenditure is needed for more
thorough renovations on Baits I.
"What we decided is Baits I is
further away from Bursley, and it
"It's a shock but not an enor-
mous piece, 1 million out of $32

Bernstein countered Nacht,
saying that the loss will hinder
AATA's ability to fund new proj-
ects.
"We now are at the end of our
ability to fund anything outside
our regular service," Bernstein
