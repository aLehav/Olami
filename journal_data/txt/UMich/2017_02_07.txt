A group of about 50 people 

demonstrated outside the City 
Council chambers before the 
meeting Tuesday, in the hopes 
of convincing the council to 
adopt a resolution declaring 
Ann Arbor a sanctuary city 
with chants of “No ICE! No 
raids! Immigrants are here to 
stay!”

The group’s protest was in 

response to an executive order 
recently signed by President 
Donald Trump, whose stated 
intent was “enhancing public 
safety in the interior of the 
United States.”

The 
order, 
signed 
Jan. 

25, ensures that “sanctuary 
jurisdictions” 
— 
cities, 

townships 
or 
universities 

that refuse to assist federal 
immigration 
authorities 
in 

identifying 
and 
detaining 

undocumented 
immigrants 

— are not eligible to receive 
federal grants, “except as 
deemed necessary for law 
enforcement purposes.”

A 
resolution 
eventually 

passed 
unanimously 
to 

enthusiastic applause from 
protesters 
and 
residents 

in 
attendance, 
effectively 

making 
Ann 
Arbor 
one. 

However, this version didn’t 
contain the words “sanctuary 
city” or any references to 
definitive protective policies. 
According to Councilmember 
Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4), the 

term “sanctuary city” does 
not 
have 
legitimate 
legal 

meaning.

The resolution did request 

that the city attorney and city 
administrator to review the 
order.

“(The) City Attorney is 

directed 
to 
research 
and 

provide 
advice 
regarding 

possible options or actions the 

City might take to protect the 
rights of the City and persons 
within its jurisdiction,” the 
resolution reads.

Before 
the 
resolution 

was 
passed, 
the 
council 

discussed how local officials 
should interact with federal 
officers, with fears of losing 
funding. 
Councilmember 

Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 

5) proposed an amendment 
declaring 
the 
Council’s 

opposition to House Bill 4105.

House 
Bill 
4105 
was 

introduced to the Michigan 
state legislature on Jan. 26 by 
state Rep. Pamela Hornberger 
(R–Pinckney) and intended to 
prohibit local governments 
from enacting policies that 

The University of Michigan 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security released a notice on their 
website and Twitter outlining 
behaviors that could decrease the 
series of armed robberies around 
campus.

“Pedestrians are encouraged to 

walk in pairs or groups,” the notice 
read. 
“Neighborhood 
residents 

are encouraged to leave on their 
porch lights. All are encouraged to 
contact police immediately at 911 if 
they see any suspicious activity.”

Following the notice, Dean of 

Students Laura Jones asked faculty 
to share the information with 
students to make the entire campus 
more aware. DPSS spokesperson 
Diane Brown said she has been 
in contact with student life about 
helping increase student safety.

“We’ve reached out to student 

life as one of our key partners on 
campus,” she said. “Particularly 
with Beyond the Diag on having 
student 
ambassadors 
in 
that 

neighborhood to help us make 
sure that message was getting 
distributed.”

The University of Michigan 

Islamic Society of Ahlulbayt 
received a report on Sunday 
that 
someone 
urinated 
on 

one of the large prayer rugs 
located in the reflection room 
in the basement of the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library.

Division of Public Safety 

and 
Security 
spokeswoman 

Diane 
Brown 
confirmed 

campus police were notified 
of the incident. The room has 
been taped off to allow it to 
be cleaned. Brown added she 
could not comment on any 
possible suspects. 

“There 
was 
an 
incident 

that was reported ... with 
vandalism in the reflection 
room,” she said. “It will likely 
be categorized with a bias 
motivation.”

Many 
reflection 
rooms 

exist on campus for the sake 
of prayer and meditation, but 
if students need to use the 
reflection room in Shapiro, the 
ISA advised students to use 
their own prayer rugs and pray 
in the back corner. The ISA

Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs discussed strategies 
on 
how 
to

2, 

Michigan’s 2006 legislation 
that 
prevents 
universities 

from 
using 
affirmative 

action — including special 
preferences based on factors 
such as ethnicity, race and 
gender — in admissions and 
hiring.

Jennifer 
Linderman, 

director of the ADVANCE 
program, first introduced the 
variety of programs housed 
under 
ADVANCE, 
which 

originated as a program to 
promote 
representation 
of 

female faculty in science, 
technology, 
engineering 

and 
mathematics 
fields 

and expanded to promote 
diversity across the University 
of Michigan as a whole.

“Basically 
we’re 
after 

supporting 
a 
diverse 
and 

excellent faculty here at the 
University,” Linderman said.

She 
also 
answered 

various 
questions 
about 

ADVANCE’s 
involvement 

with the University’s hiring 
process and its process for 
department-specific 
social 

climate surveys. In regards to 
hiring new faculty members, 
Linderman said ADVANCE 
primarily offers advice on 
how to be mindful of diversity 
during the review of potential 
faculty and staff members.

“I see it mostly as advice as 

how to be thoughtful about 
your process in terms of when 
you evaluate candidates,” she 
said.

Possible Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos has given ambigious responses in past

Under 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s administration, the 
fate of Title IX and actions 
associated 
with 
it, 
both 

nationally and at the University 
of Michigan, are uncertain.

In 2011, the U.S. Department 

of 
Education’s 
Office 
for 

Civil Rights, in conjunction 
with then-President Obama’s 
administration, 
released 
a 

“Dear 
Colleague” 
letter 
to 

universities, 
emphasizing 

Title 
IX’s 
prohibition 
of 

discrimination “on the basis of 
sex in education programs or 
activities operated by recipients 
of Federal financial assistance.”

This 
guidance 
stipulated 

universities’ 
obligations 
to 

promptly respond to sexual 
misconduct claims on their 
campuses.

Given 
the 
report, 
the 

University of Michigan is one 
of over 240 schools undergoing 
a formal investigation by the 
Department of Education of its 

handling of sexual misconduct 
cases. The investigation began 
nearly three years ago, in 
February 2014.

The University has since 

come under fire for failing 
to release documents related 
to 
the 
investigation 
in 
a 

timely manner. A Freedom of 
Information Act request was 
filed against the University 
in 2015 for the release of 
documents such as written 
complaints, emails and other 
statements 
to 
further 
the 

investigation. The request was 

paid for in part by The Michigan 
Daily.

As of now, the investigation 

is still underway, according to 
University officials. However, 
its continuation is questionable 
given the overhaul set to occur 
within 
the 
Department 
of 

Education in the coming weeks. 
 

The vote to confirm Betsy 

DeVos, Michigan native and 
education activist, as secretary 
of education is expected to 
occur Tuesday, according to 
CNN. DeVos is expected to

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

The University of 

Michigan recently raised 

more than $1.3 million 

through faculty and staff 

donations and volunteer 

efforts aimed at increasing 

funding for human services 

in Washtenaw County.

The United Way 

campaign is a national 

organization with local 

branches that seeks to 

improve community 

conditions and togetherness 

through empowerment, 

programs for the youth and 

elderly, education support 

and aid for the homeless.

The University 

branch of the United Way 

campaign focuses on a 

variety of opportunities and 

social concerns, including 

increasing financial 

stability and providing 

basic health care and living 

necessities. According to 

the campaign’s website, 

the 2016 campaign raised 

$1.2 million of a $1.5 million 

goal.

According to the 

University Record, more 

than 500 University 

employee volunteers 

turned out in 2016 to give 

their time to the effort. 

Contributions to the 

campaign also came from 

University units such as 

Michigan Athletics, the 

University Musical Society, 

Nichols Arboretum and 

MHealthy.

Cynthia Wilbanks, 

University vice president 

for Government Relations 

and the campaign’s 

co-chair, said to the 

University Record she 

expressed great pride 

in the institution and its 

employees’ dedication to 

aiding people living in the 

communities surrounding 

the University.

“The employees of the 

University of Michigan 

have proven how much they 

care about our neighbors by 

their support of the United 

Way campaign,” Wilbanks 

said. “This is a better 

and stronger community 

because of their generosity. 

Together we show that we 

can make a difference in 

everyday lives.”

The Washtenaw 

County United Way team 

also thanked the University 

for its dedication to their 

cause.

Pam Smith, president 

and CEO of the United Way 

of Washtenaw County, said 

the University has the most 

successful campaign of 

any Big 10 universities and 

noted the vast impact the 

contribution will make.

“I would like to 

personally thank the 

faculty and staff for their 

participation in the United 

Way campaign, once again 

proving they are the leaders 

and best,” Smith said. “The 

University of Michigan 

provides exemplary 

leadership and commitment 

to our community.”

E NGLISH RE VIVAL

Senate Democrats aiming to block 
DeVos’s education appointment

Democrats to hold Congress for 24 hours, citing DeVos as unqualified for job

U.S. Senate Democrats are 

intending to hold the Senate 
floor for 24 hours in protest of 
the nomination of Betsy DeVos, 
Michigan native and education 
activist, for secretary of education. 
The final vote is expected to take 
place at noon on Tuesday.

Multiple Democrats indicated 

they would voice their concerns 
in the all-night protest on Monday 
afternoon and spread the word of 
their objections using the hashtag 
“#HoldTheFloor.”

Currently, all Senate Democrats 

and two Senate Republicans plan 
to vote against DeVos. Unless 
Democrats 
are 
successful 
in 

convincing another Republican 
senator to switch his or her vote, 
Vice President Mike Pence will 
likely have to break a 50-50 tie, and 

is expected to support DeVos.

Republicans won the procedural 

vote on whether or not to extend the 
debate time on Friday with a 52-48 
vote along party lines. According to 
the Senate Historical Office, this 
would be the first time the vice 
president would have to break a tie 
for a Cabinet confirmation.

“We’re very confident that 

Betsy DeVos is going to be the next 
secretary of education, and it’ll be 
my high honor to cast the deciding 
vote on the floor of the Senate next 
week,” Pence said Sunday on Fox 
News.

Republicans 
have 
defended 

DeVos as a true conservative who 
will decrease federal involvement 
in 
public 
education, 
while 

Democrats are concerned with her 
lack of education experience and 
her emphasis on directing funding 
toward charter schools.

Sen. Gary Peters (D–Mich.) 

spoke on the Senate floor in 

January in opposition to DeVos, 
and said, in addition to having no 
education experience, the failure 
of Michigan charter schools proves 
DeVos’s plan to be dangerous.

“Unfortunately, in my home 

state of Michigan, the charter 
school experiment has not lived 
up to the promises made,” Peters 
said. “In fact, 65 percent of charter 
schools in Michigan fail — yes, 
fail — to significantly outperform 
traditional public schools in reading 
outcomes. In Detroit, 70 percent of 
charter schools are in the bottom 
quartile of Michigan’s schools.”

Peters, who said his office 

has received over 8,000 calls in 
opposition to DeVos, spoke again 
on the Senate floor during the 
24-hour protest on Monday, and 
urged his colleagues to listen to 
their constituencies.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D–

Mich.) also took to the 24-hour 
Senate floor protest to express 

her 
concern, 
emphasizing 

that charter schools make 
education a commodity, which 
many cannot afford.

“A competitive free market 

system with winners and 
losers works in the private 
marketplace,” 
Stabenow 

said. “But, it doesn’t work 
for educating our children, 
because we can’t afford losers 
when it comes to something 
as 
basic 
as 
fundamental 

education.” 

While 
Democrats 
are 

expected to hold the floor 
overnight, Republican senators 
made the majority voice heard 
on Monday as well. Majority 
Leader 
Mitch 
McConnell 

(R–Ky.) advocated for DeVos’s 
plan to decentralize public 
education.

“Importantly, 
she 
also 

understands that our teachers, 
students, 
parents, 
school 

boards and local and state 
governments are best suited 
to make education decisions, 
not Washington bureaucrats,” 
McConnell said.

Students walk from table to table at the LSA Social Impact Fair in the Union on Monday.

M AKE A DIFFE RE NCE

results are used and anonymity 
of participants. He said faculty 
members are often reluctant 
to 
fill 
out 
demographic 

information and surveys in 
general because they feel they 
may be identified based on 
responses.

“What happens is, when you 

don’t know me, that’s a silent 
voice,” he said. “And why you 
don’t know about me is because 
I know if you ask about me, 
you’re going to know it’s me. So 
if you’re asking me to evaluate 
my dean, this is one cell size 
away from knowing who sent 
that evaluation in.” 

However, 
Linderman 
said 

when conducting departmental 
climate 
surveys, 
ADVANCE 

emphasizes high participation 
and anonymity when conveying 
results.

“ADVANCE is outside of 

the unit, so we’re hoping that 

makes people understand that 
we’re not part of the unit … 
we’re outside,” she said. “We 
do not give results that are 
identifiable … we work really 
hard to make sure individuals 
are not identifiable, we are very 
concerned about that, as you 
are.”

Robert Sellers, vice provost 

for 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion, 

also discussed his duties as 
chief diversity officer at the 
meeting, a position created last 
October in conjunction with 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion plan, to oversee 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 

strategic plan. He said these 
efforts are vital for achieving 
the University’s mission.

“When 
I 
think 
about 

DEI, it’s fundamental to our 
proposition as a University; 
it’s absolutely consistent with 
our mission as an institution,” 
Sellers said.

Sellers 
responded 
to 

questions about the place of 

standardized testing in the 
evaluation of graduate school 
candidates and the interaction 
between 
Proposal 
2 
and 

recruitment techniques. 

Ortega wondered how the 

practices implemented with 
the DEI plan might be better 
communicated to faculty.

“I guess the bigger question is 

how faculty are being engaged 
in these conversations, so we 
can get some of these agendas 
out and pay attention to them,” 
he said.

Sellers said he has held 

various formal and informal 
meetings with diverse groups 
of faculty members to foster 
discussion 
about 
University 

policies on diversity, citing 
conversations related to the 
extent of Proposal 2.

“One of the effects of Prop 2 

is this false sense that we can’t 
do anything, and people being 
afraid of moving forward,” he 
said. “There’s a lot of things 
we can do, we just have to be 
careful and be lawful.”

warned the cleaning of the

state of purity and cleanliness 
required to touch the Quran, 
and advised that students not

The ISA and the Muslim 

Student Association recently 
released a statement via email, 
writing the damage done to 
the room affected students of 
all different faiths. 

“As practitioners of Islam 

and students at the University

reflection rooms represent 
a key dimension of spiritual

practice of our faith wherever 
our day may take us,” it read. 
“Campus reflection rooms are 
also an inclusive space, shared 
among students of all religions 
and spiritualities; including 
Christian, Jewish, Buddhist 

non-religious, spiritual etc. 
Safeguarding our places of 
personal, spiritual and faith 
based prayer and reflection is 

integral to fostering a diverse 
and tolerant Michigan. Along 
with the support of University 
administration, we invite our 

peers and colleagues to stand 
and act in support of not 
only Muslim students, but all 
affected communities at this 
time.”

According to Brown, DPSS 

will not likely send out a crime

be confirmed, because of the 
projection that Vice President 
Mike 
Pence 
will 
cast 
the 

tie-breaker vote in a Senate 
otherwise facing a 50-50 split, 
with all 48 members of the 
Democratic caucus and two 
Republicans opposing DeVos.

DeVos’ confirmation has been 

at the center of controversies 
surrounding the qualifications 
of Trump’s Cabinet selections. 
DeVos 
sparked 
particular 

concern upon responding to 
questions regarding Title IX at 
her hearing in January. When 
asked if she would preserve the 
Title IX guidance, her response 
was deemed ambiguous.

“If confirmed, I look forward 

to 
understanding 
the 
past 

actions and current situation 
better, and to ensuring that 
the intent of the law is actually 
carried out in a way that 
recognizes both the victim … as 
well as those who are accused,” 
DeVos said.

Upon 
further 
prompting, 

DeVos 
said 
it 
would 
be 

“premature” 
to 
affirm 
her 

commitment to the preservation 
of the guidance at that time.

As 
for 
the 
University’s 

investigation, in an interview 
with the Daily at the end of 
January, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
said 
the 

University has been cooperating 
with the OCR, but has not been 
apprised of the results of the 
investigation.

He said the University is 

looking forward to receiving 
the results so it can continue 
to foster a safe environment for 
students and support survivors 
of sexual misconduct. 

“We’re very anxious to have 

the 
investigation 
resolved 

to get whatever advice or 
guidance the Office of Civil 

Rights wants to offer so that we 
can do as good a job as possible 
making our campus safe,” he 
said. “We’re committed to the 
concepts of Title IX — to have 
a workplace, a study place, an 
environment that is free of 
discrimination 
and 
adverse 

aspects so that everyone has 
an opportunity to learn … I’m 
always committed to advice 
from OCR or other places about 
how we can do it better. But we 
haven’t heard anything. We’re 
still waiting.”

Schlissel 
pointed 
to 
a 

University 
campus 
climate 

survey administered on sexual 
misconduct in January 2015 as 
proof of his commitment to the 
issue. He said the University is 
utilizing different methods to 
address and fix the problem.

“We’re 
approaching 
it 

through educational programs, 
we’re 
approaching 
it 
by 

focusing our efforts where the 
survey told us the highest 
incidents of misconduct were,” 
he said. “We’re approaching 
it by combating the linkage 
with alcohol overuse, which 
is involved in many episodes 
of sexual misconduct, and we 
put out in July a year ago a 
revised set of policies for how 
we investigate and adjudicate 
accusations of misconduct.”

The 
updated 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy 
Schlissel 

referenced went into effect 
last July. Changes included an 
expanded, more encompassing 
definition of sexual misconduct, 
as well as adjustments to the 
definition of consent and the 
sanctioning process. 

Though the University plans 

to keep its policy as is, with 
the impending changes in the 
Department 
of 
Education, 

the fate of the investigation is 
unknown.

In an email to the Daily, 

University spokeswoman Dana 
Elger said the University is not 
going to speculate, as things at 

the national level are still in 
flux, though she reaffirmed the 
investigation is still underway. 

Mark Rosenbaum, a former 

University law professor, has 
worked with the American Civil 
Liberties Union and is now the 
director of the Opportunity 
Under Law Project at Public 
Counsel, a nationwide pro bono 
civil rights office. Rosenbaum 
said that, though the authority 
of Title IX is firmly established, 
it is too soon to tell what 
will happen in regard to the 
investigations.

“Title IX is Title IX is Title 

IX; the law has been precisely 
what it is,” he emphasized. 
“Although 
the 
Obama 

administration was the most 
vigorous enforcer of Title IX of 
any administration, where that 
goes from here, I don’t think we 
know.”

He said DeVos did not seem 

to exhibit familiarity with Title 
IX or express any commitment 
to its enforcement. He hopes 
and 
expects 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
commitment 

will be as “resolute” as that of 
the Obama administration.

Rosenbaum noted that by 

way of investigations and other 
related efforts, the Department 
of Education publicized these 
issues and produced awareness 
at the student and campus level.

He 
said 
he 
thinks 
this 

contribution will be a driving 
force 
in 
addressing 
sexual 

misconduct, regardless of what 
happens.

“Not having the United States 

Department of Education out 
there is clearly not a good thing, 
but I don’t think you can reverse 
the momentum that the Obama 
administration 
created 
with 

respect to enforcement of Title 
IX,” he said. “I think even if the 
Trump administration turns us 
back on Title IX, I don’t think 
it’s going to get buried under 
the sand.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair 
of the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, claimed 
the 
Obama 
administration 

received flak for overstepping 
its bounds.

“The 
law 
prohibits 

discrimination by sex or gender 
in an educational environment, 
that’s pretty much what it 
says,” he said. “There’s an 
argument 
that 
the 
Obama 

administration’s interpretation 
of it regarding sexual assault is 
a bit of stretch when it comes 
to the law itself. That’s not to 
say opponents of it do not care 
about sexual assault.”

Merrill said though sexual 

assault is clearly a problem, he 
believes the law is referring 
more to what is happening in 
classrooms and on the athletic 
field, or discrimination in the 
sense of not allowing someone 
to take a class or play a sport. 
He said DeVos did not confirm 
a 
reversal 
of 
the 
Obama 

administration’s interpretation 
of the law, but said she would 
continue to look into it.

He 
said 
he 
felt 
sexual 

misconduct 
investigations 

conducted by the University 
should be expedited, saying 
that, 
some 
sexual 
assault 

claims are not entirely true, 
though this is very rare. He also 
said the legal system is a more 
appropriate, efficient means for 
for addressing sexual assault 
allegations.

“I think if you’re going to 

find out who is right and who 
is wrong, you should really go 
through the police department, 
the court and the legal process 
— not the University itself,” he 
said. “I don’t think that people 
who are working here for 
educational issues should have 
to spend all their time on these 
long investigations that law 
enforcement specializes in and 
is there to do.”

Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 

former director of the Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center, who oversaw 
the implementation of the new 
sexual misconduct policy, said 
in a March interview that a 
primary reason the University 
expanded its policy — and, 
along the same lines, sexual 
misconduct investigations — 
was to be compliant with the 
Clery Act and Title IX, both of 
which regulate sexual assault 
reporting and investigations at 
public universities.

Rackham 
student 
Nicole 

Bedera 
is 
one 
of 
several 

researchers 
working 
on 
a 

project that looks at how 
colleges 
have 
responded 

to guidance about how to 
interpret 
Title 
IX 
in 
the 

context of their campuses.

In an email to the Daily, 

Bedera 
wrote 
she 
expects 

the Trump administration to 
respond differently to Title 
IX issues than the Obama 
administration did.

“The Trump administration 

does 
not 
have 
the 
same 

commitment 
to 
addressing 

campus sexual assault that 
the 
Obama 
administration 

did,” 
she 
wrote. 
“Multiple 

key players in the Trump 
administration, 
including 

Betsy 
DeVos, 
have 
spoken 

against the interpretation of 
Title IX currently used by the 
Department of Education. Title 
IX will likely remain on the 
books as written, just as it did 
in the Obama administration, 
but I suspect it won’t be 
enforced the same way it has 
been in recent years in regards 
to sexual assault.”

She continued by stating 

she 
sees 
two 
potential 

scenarios. She thinks the new 
administration 
will 
create 

its own policies around Title 
IX or stop enforcing existing 
policies. 

“If 
the 
Department 
of 

Education 
stops 
enforcing 

existing policies, there might 
be 
enough 
momentum 
on 

college campuses to maintain 
the changes made in the past 
two years and some campuses 
may even have a strong enough 
commitment to the fight to 
continue 
to 
innovate 
and 

support survivors — especially 
if student activists continue to 
put pressure on their schools,” 
she wrote. “But the schools 
that are still failing survivors 
will have no reason to improve 
services.”

She added, alternatively, if 

the administration creates new 
policies, survivors will likely 
not receive the same gains.

“The 
administration 
has 

hinted that they don’t see the 
value in many policies aimed 
at preventing violence against 
women and offering survivors 
reswources 
for 
recovery, 

including the Violence Against 
Women’s 
Act 
and 
support 

for 
Planned 
Parenthood,” 

she wrote. “I can’t imagine 
the administration would be 
any more sympathetic to the 
struggle for safety on campus.”

limit 
local 
officials 
from 

cooperating 
with 
federal 

immigration 
officials. 
The 

amendment, which passed by a 
10-1 vote, was opposed only by 
Councilmember Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2), who expressed fears of 
losing state or local funding.

According 
to 
City 

Administrator 
Howard 

Lazarus, 
however, 
the 

amendment doesn’t jeopardize 
any state or federal funds the 
city of Ann Arbor currently 
receives.

“Nothing 
that 
we 
do 

requires us to enforce federal 
immigration laws,” he said 
in regards to Warpehoski’s 
amendment. “That does not put 
us at any risk right now.”

Ann Arbor resident Roger 

Kuhlman opposed the order, 
saying the “hysteria” about the 
executive order doesn’t help 
America, but “incites public 
hate.”

“It really bothers me when 

I hear local liberal Democratic 
politicians say that we must 
stand with and support the 
illegal alien community and 
possibly establish a sanctuary 

city here for criminal illegal 
aliens,” he said. “I really don’t 
understand that. Do you want 
to bring people in like the 
illegal alien thug out in San 
Francisco who murdered Kate 
Steinle? Do you want to reward 
illegal aliens for knowingly and 
willingly breaking many U.S. 

laws?”

Kuhlman 
was 
referring 

to the accidental 2015 fatal 
shooting of Kathryn Steinle by 
Francisco Sanchez, who had 
been deported from the United 
States five times prior to the 
shooting.

Ann Arbor resident Julie 

Quiroz expressed to the council 

her wish that the city take 
action that is more than just 
symbolic.

“To keep us safe, we need 

to evolve our local policies 
to 
make 
our 
cities 
real 

sanctuaries for all residents, 
not cancel them because of the 
illegitimate president’s latest 
actions,” she said. “That means 
a commitment to separating 
police from federal immigration 
enforcement, and addressing 
the policing that funnels Black 
and other residents to jail and 
places criminal charges on 
immigrant residents.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 
1), 

addressing Quiroz’s concerns, 
assured residents the resolution 
was the first step of many the 
city would be taking.

“I just want to make sure 

that all of you are aware of the 
fact that the resolution that 
we’re bringing forward today 
is just the first step toward 
additional steps that at least 
a couple of us are seriously 
thinking of doing,” she said. 
“At the national level, it has 
been really hard for all of us 
the last three weeks. But the 
kind of input that we have 
got from you, that makes me 
feel that we will survive as a 
community.”

T

here has been a lot of 
talk lately surrounding 
the intolerance some 

have for those who differ 
from 
the 
societal 

majority. 
President 

Donald 
Trump’s 

recent executive order 
suspending the entry 
of immigrants from 
six Muslim-majority 
countries for 90 days 
and indefinitely from 
Syria 
has 
brought 

about both opposition 
and 
support 
from 

many people around 
the nation. This move created 
confusion during its execution 
and has caused many to believe 
our progress in the United 
States is coming to an end and 
is possibly even being reversed.

The day prior to the signing 

of 
the 
executive 
order, 
I 

attended a talk focusing on 
global citizenship and cultural 
competency. The talk was a 
part of the Martin Luther King 
Jr. Symposium event series 
and served to let audience 
members hear speakers from 
various backgrounds present 
their personal interpretations 
of what it means to be globally 
minded.

Every 
story 
shared 
was 

moving and provided insight 
into 
the 
sheer 
range 
of 

experiences one can have that 
contribute to shaping a global 
citizen. One speaker, Public 
Health student Abbas Alawieh, 
claimed cultural competency 
is having the cultural humility 
to set aside your own biases 
about another culture, which 
includes 
the 
continued 

refinement of this humility as 
more cultures are experienced 
in a deeper way.

Each day, our world becomes 

a little more connected and 
figuratively a little smaller. 
With the progress of the 
internet and technology, our 
world has drastically changed 
even within the last 50 years. 
Therefore, in a time when 
people of all backgrounds 
have the opportunity to travel 
this planet, it is critical to 
realize with this opportunity 
comes responsibility. 

Global 
citizenship 
and 

cultural 
competency 
are 

rising phenomena that have 
yet to be given exact roles in 

the broad sense of 
society. There has 
never been a need 
(before 
now) 
to 

culturally define the 
connection one has 
with all the people of 
the world; therefore, 
it is the job of this 
rising 
generation, 

our generation, to 
bring these ideas to 
the forefront. Our 

role as millennials in this 
newly connected world is to 
lead the way in developing 
our global identity, not only 
within ourselves but also 
within our own culture.

Such a responsibility cannot 

be taken lightly. It is more 
than a short spring break trip 
that is “equal parts cultural 
immersion and party” that 
claims to leave us with the 
right to say we are one with 
the world. Global citizenship, 
just as any other citizenship 
or heritage, is a part of an 
individual’s 
identity. 
And 

as with any other part of 
personal identity, it takes time 
to develop and will change as 
one goes through life. 

This 
involves 
creating 
a 

world where we all have rich 
intercultural experiences, one 
in which it is no longer a luxury 
to learn about another way of 
life. Already, more and more 
people are going abroad for their 
studies, and now there is need to 
create a cultural environment 
at home that allows these 
individuals 
to 
share 
their 

experiences with the rest of 
society once they return.

Many will ask what gives 

millennials the authority to 
lead society in this endeavor. 
Why do we think we can 
change the world? It is not 
because we have all been gifted 
with some vast wisdom that 
skipped all other generations.

Millennials are the ones 

who must take on this task 
because we are the generation 
being 
educated 
in 
this 

interconnected 
world. 
Our 

educations and careers are being 
foundationally shaped by a new 
way of thinking that carries on 
to how we make decisions.

A study conducted by Jane 

Whitney Gibson, a professor at 
Nova Southeastern University, 
asked participants belonging to 
the Baby Boomer, Generation 
X and Millennial generations 
to rank workplace values that 
are the most important to 
them. Gibson found that even 
though the top values were 
shared 
across 
generations, 

millennials 
prioritized 

broadmindedness higher than 
any other generation.

Millennials 
are 
currently 

the largest living generation in 
the United States, which means 
we have the power to lead 
the inevitable change that is 
coming. We must remember the 
stroke of a pen is not enough to 
erase the mindset and goals of 
an entire generation.

Roland 
Alexander 

Blackwood, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Medical 
School 

faculty lead for Leaders and 
Learners Pathways, was the 
final speaker of the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day talk and left 
us with this idea: “You are the 
future. I’m old, done with my 
time. If someone doesn’t want 
you, who cares? You go where 
you must go … Be confident and 
believe in yourself. Don’t let 
anyone take your joy, take your 
thunder or control you because 
you belong here.”

So with this, I challenge 

everybody to look at their 
current 
situation 
and 

search for ways to begin the 
journey to global citizenship. 
Broadmindedness 
starts 

by interacting with nearby 
communities, 
having 
open 

conversations with members of 
these communities and pushing 
yourself into experiences from 
which you can learn.

As you go through this, 

remember why you are doing 
it: We are the pioneers of global 
citizenship; we are the ones 
who must lead the change we 
want to see in the world.

M

ike Mansfield, who 
was 
the 
longest-

serving 
Senate 

Majority Leader in the history 
of the United States, once 
referred to the Senate as “the 
world’s greatest deliberative 
body.” Our Senate is meant 
to carefully vet each piece 
of governmental business it 
encounters and to take its time 
in the process. But now it is 
poised to bitterly fight over 
an unquestionably qualified 
Supreme Court nominee.

The Senate is a temple of 

reason. What Democrats are 
potentially doing to Judge Neil 
Gorsuch, the current Supreme 
Court nominee, is unreasonable.

After a rancorous election, 

virtually everyone expressed a 
longing for the days when our 
government and society were 
not so damaged and divided. 
As a student who identifies as 
center-right, I welcomed these 
calls for respectful discourse, 
especially being in such a liberal 
environment. However, it did not 
take long for me and many others 
to become disheartened.

Human nature is human 

nature; Republicans slighted 
Democrats 
by 
stonewalling 

Judge Merrick Garland, former 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

nominee, 
and 
a 
peaceful 

confirmation 
this 
time 

around 
would 
undoubtedly 

aid President Donald Trump, 
leaving many Democrats eager 
to stymie Gorsuch. However, 
these purely political concerns 
must not dictate the policy of 
loyal congressional opposition.

Slowly 
but 
surely, 
the 

Supreme 
Court 
nomination 

process has become another 
outlet for the left and right to 
vent their many incompatible 
differences. It used to be that a 
nominee need only be qualified 
for the job both professionally 
and personally. With a few 
exceptions, modern nominees 
have virtually sailed through 
the confirmation process. Fair 
consideration was granted to 
Justices 
Anthony 
Kennedy, 

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John 

Roberts and Sonia Sotomayor. 
The man who nominated them 
wasn’t a primary issue for these 
nominees, and neither was the 
surrounding political climate.

The 
Republican 
stonewall 

of Garland can be remembered 
as a singular, horribly partisan 
handling of the independent 
judiciary. But by blocking the 
confirmation of an unblemished 
jurist, Democrats will firmly 
establish that as a precedent. 
They will force Senate Majority 
Leader Mitch McConnell (R–
Ky.) to end the ability to filibuster 
on Supreme Court nominations 
— invoking the “nuclear option” 
— just to maintain a full bench. 
Scrapping 
this 
important 

extra scrutiny for judges of 
our nation’s highest court will 
not only erode the fabric of the 
Supreme Court’s prestige, but 
it will send bellicose echoes 
through the halls of Congress.

It would be easy to say “an 

eye for an eye.” It would be 
simple to rally the liberal base 
by filibustering the nomination 
of Gorsuch. It would be a great 
political victory for Democrats 
to deny Trump his pick. But 
these 
short-term 
triumphs 

would come with tremendous 
long-term costs.

One way or another, the 

president will fill the vacant 
seat left by Justice Antonin 
Scalia, who died last February, 
with his choice of justice. 
It’s now up to Democrats to 
either accept reality or face the 
harrowing 
consequences 
of 

forcing the nuclear option upon 
the Senate and throwing our 
American polity into a new era 
of uncertainty.

Confirming 
Gorsuch 
will 

send multiple messages to an 
anxious 
population 
fraught 

with anger directed at those 
of differing political views. 
First, and to the benefit of their 
party, Democrats can show 
they are willing to sacrifice 
partisan animosity for the 
benefit of the nation. It would 
show the American people that 
our government is willing to 
come together, even if it means 

allowing the president to claim 
a political victory. Additionally, 
Congress would be able to 
declare they are committed to 
the orderly execution of the 
functions of a well-working 
government, no matter the 
ideological differences.

Eventually, citizens on both 

sides of the aisle need to realize 
a successful government action 
can be considered a win for the 
nation rather than a political 
party or one politician. Could 
one 
construe 
a 
Gorsuch 

confirmation as a victory for 
Trump? Yes, but that view is 
short-sighted. 
The 
peaceful 

confirmation of Gorsuch would 
be a victory for the integrity 
of the Senate, bipartisanship, 
the Supreme Court and the 
nation. This view, I’ll admit, 
is optimistic at worst and 
understated at best.

It is understandable to see 

the current political atmosphere 
using 
the 
former 
approach. 

Cynicism is abound in every 
corner of the nation, in liberal 
urban enclaves and Trumpian 
rural towns alike. Yet, if we 
change our attitudes toward 
one another, toward the way 
we discuss political differences, 
toward the way we conduct the 
business of government, I believe 
we can reach a more congenial 
form of politics.

It 
has 
been 
said 
that 

politicians look to the next 
election 
while 
statesmen 

look to the next generation. 
Republicans were politicians 
when they refused to perform 
their constitutional duties of 
advising and consenting to a 
new justice. Democrats can 
now either prove they are just 
as petty as their opposition 
by playing politics with our 
judiciary, or they could set an 
example and act like statesmen.

Michelle Obama once told 

Democrats, “When they go 
low, we go high.” Talk is cheap. 
Let’s see if Democrats can act 
on those words.

I

t was move-in day. I 
was 
a 
sweaty, 
naive 

freshman whose biggest 

concern was making sure my 
carpet matched my 
bedding. 
I 
looked 

forward to a fresh 
start in a new place 
with new faces to 
greet. On that sunny 
day in September, 
I had no idea how 
much 
I 
would 

grow, 
learn 
and 

discover in this first, 
transitional 
year 

from 
high 
school 

senior to college student.

As a freshman, I was sent 

off with a kiss on the cheek 
from my mom and a stern 
look from my dad that said 
“work 
your 
hardest.” 
As 

these constant reminders and 
support from the people you 
love start to fade after move-in 
day, it is only up to you to push 
yourself to make the most of 
your college experience.

At the beginning of this 

year, I started small. I set an 
achievable goal that I knew I 
could accomplish. I promised 
myself shortly after laying 
down my rug and organizing 
my shoe shelf that I would 
always take the stairs in an 
attempt to stay fit. I lived on 
the fourth floor, and I felt that 
this was a very achievable goal.

To this day, I have kept my 

word. I know that no matter 
how horrible of a day I’m 
having, I can walk up four 
flights of stairs and tell myself 
I have accomplished something 
productive that day. For me, 
making it to the top of the 
stairs gives me a feeling of 
accomplishment, 
like 
acing 

a test or landing a job. I push 

myself to do this simple task 
that leaves me feeling satisfied, 
knowing I at least worked for 
something that day.

The 
challenge 

of coming to such 
a large school is 
that, if you don’t 
know 
where 
your 

community lies or 
what your interests 
are, it can be a hard 
challenge to push 
yourself to learn a 
new hobby or meet 
new people. But I 
kept pushing myself 

to meet new people, join new 
clubs or try new restaurants 
that tested my taste buds.

In contrast, the benefit 

of coming to a school with 
over 44,000 students is that 
no matter how unique your 
interests may be, you can 
find someone who enjoys the 
same things you do. As an 
avid “Bachelor” fan, I found 
a place to express my love for 
the show by joining a fantasy 
league. I just had to push 
myself to find the right people 
who indulged in the same 
guilty pleasures as I did.

There have been moments 

when I have been scared to 
start a conversation, and many 
times I have had awkward 
experiences of trying to branch 
out and try something new. I 
have come to realize you need 
to know yourself and your 
limits. We are all different 
and 
will 
push 
ourselves 

differently. But I do not speak 
for everyone. I know myself: I 
am a hardworking, determined 
individual who is constantly 
pushing 
myself 
to 
be 
the 

best person I can be. But for 
many freshmen — and college 

students in general — our 
abilities to push ourselves get 
fogged with a misconception 
that we don’t know if we are 
pushing ourselves in the right 
direction.

As sophomore year looms 

overhead, I wonder if I have 
made my time as a freshman 
count. While I had an idea of 
the things I wanted to surround 
myself with, I don’t know if I 
have taken advantage of all the 
opportunities I have interest in, 
and I will try to continue to try 
new things in the years to come.

In a world of fear and 

fright, we need to take risks 
to pursue a new hobby or join 
a new club. College is the only 
time we are surrounded by a 
large majority of people our 
age, who are expanding their 
views of the world and have 
genuine interests in learning 
new things. It is through 
these experiences of pushing 
that we learn the most about 
ourselves and our interests. I 
have found that by challenging 
myself academically, socially 
and extracurricular-ly, I have 
surrounded 
myself 
with 
a 

community I feel comfortable 
in. And I think that we could 
all benefit from that.

College is a time to grow. It 

is a time to get away from your 
parents and expand on ideas and 
study topics that are interesting 
to you. Though choices can 
become 
overwhelming 
at 
a 

school 
that 
basically 
offers 

everything, as students we must 
take advantage of this, because 
these opportunities will be 
harder to find once we leave 
this campus.

‘Becoming Warren’ does 
not do the Sage justice

HBO documentary scratches the surface of Warren 
Buffet’s fascinating rise to the top of his industry, beyond

Whenever Warren Buffett’s 

name is mentioned, there’s 
a certain mystique attached. 
It’s not simply because he’s 
wealthy — his net worth is 
estimated to be around 60 
billion dollars — but because 
of his idiosyncrasies. Buffett 
has come to be defined by 
his 
eccentric 
personality, 

but, 
unfortunately, 
HBO’s 

new documentary about the 
financial magnate, “Becoming 
Warren 
Buffet,” 
fails 
to 

offer more than a cursory 
perspective 
into 
the 
most 

intriguing 
aspects 
of 
the 

investor’s life.

Directed by documentary 

vets Peter Kunhardt (“Nixon 
by Nixon: In His Own Words”) 
and Brian Oakes (“Jim: The 
James 
Foley 
Story”), 
the 

biopic sees Buffet chronicling 
his rise in his own words. 
The 
documentary 
includes 

interviews 
with 
many 
of 

Buffett’s 
colleagues, 
family members 
and 
friends. 

This is easily 
the 
strongest 

aspect 
of 

“Becoming 
Warren 
Buffett,” 
with 
Buffett’s 

longtime 
co-worker 
Charlie Munger 
offering 
particularly 
insightful 

anecdotes 
about 
the 

billionaire. 
Outside 
these 

interviews, the documentary 
features extensive footage of 
Buffett’s daily life, depicting 
his morning routine of a 
three-dollar 
McDonald’s 

breakfast sandwich and five-
minute drive to the offices of 
the financial conglomerate he 
took over in 1970, Berkshire 

Hathaway.

Due to Buffet’s intimate 

connection 
with 
Berkshire 

Hathaway, “Becoming Warren 
Buffett” devotes much of its 
time to the firm’s history. The 
documentary 
outlines 
the 

winding road the company 
has taken since its founding in 
1839 to its present ownership 
stakes in Coca-Cola, Kraft 
and American Express, which 
have netted the 
company billions 
of 
dollars 

annually. While 
these scenes of 
the 
company’s 

history 
don’t 

make 
for 
the 

most 
exciting 

television, 
the 

documentary 
does 
well 
at 

explaining Buffet’s decisions 
in a clear, succinct way that 
makes the firm’s range of 
dealings 
understandable 
to 

less financially savvy viewers.

It’s unfortunate, however, 

that the documentary is so 
keen on focusing on Berkshire 

Hathaway. 
Learning about 
the 
financial 

behemoth 
is 

interesting, 
but 
for 
a 

Warren Buffett 
documentary 
to 
succeed 
it 

must focus on 
the 
real 
star 

of 
the 
show: 

Buffett, in all 
his 
eccentric 

glory. Although 

“Becoming Warren Buffett” 
does portray a few of Buffett’s 
quirks, like his fondness for 
Coca-Cola, it spends far too 
little time on them, instead 
focusing on the trite, battle-
tested, “rags-to-riches” story 
arc. That’s not to suggest that 
Buffett’s rise isn’t fascinating, 
but it represents a massive 
missed opportunity for the 
documentary 
to 
dive 
into 

what makes the proclaimed 
“Sage of Omaha” tick. Even 
more disappointing is that 
when the documentary does 
provide 
these 
glimpses 
of 

Buffet’s character — like when 
he chooses to buy a 22 cent 
cheaper meal simply because 
the stock market is down that 
day — the biopic is enthralling, 
and Buffett’s character begins 
to shine through the screen.

At 
times, 

“Becoming 
Warren Buffett” 
feels rushed and 
it’s 
apparent 

the 
filmmakers 

struggled to fit all 
of Buffett’s story 
into a 90-minute 
documentary. 

The result is a product without 
strong 
focus; 
one 
that 
is 

content to show Buffett’s life 
without going beyond surface 
level analysis. For example, 
the documentary emphasizes 
Buffett’s hatred of Wall Street 
and his moral opposition to 
predatory banks, yet does not 
seek his thoughts on the 2008 
financial crisis, which saw 
millions of Americans lose 
their homes due to cutthroat 
banks taking advantage of 
them. Confining Buffett to 
this sort of vacuum prevents 
viewers 
from 
gaining 
a 

clearer perspective into his 
character, and this, too, feels 
like a missed opportunity for 
the documentary to separate 
itself from other stories about 
Buffett’s life.

Overall, 
while 
“Becoming 

Warren 
Buffett” 
offers 
an 

intriguing 
view 
into 
the 

billionaire’s life, it feels like a 
half-baked documentary. The 
biopic fails to delve farther. It 
likely could have benefited from 
a move to a full two-hour piece. 
In its current format, however, 
the documentary fails to take 
advantage of its unique subject 
— the Sage of Omaha deserved 
more than this.

HBO

Billionaire Warren Buffet

CONNOR GRADY

For the Daily

“The Space Between Us” is a 

paradox: A film with an original 
premise but no other original 
thoughts. In the beginning, it 
is intriguing in just how many 
uncharted paths it can take its 
characters. It just so happens 
that it goes down the same path 
that almost every other young 
adult romance flick travels. It 
has everything — no trope goes 
unused; no stereotype need fear 
being turned away. “The Space 
Between Us” has room for all. 
Anybody who has been to the 
movies in the last decade has 
seen this teen-angst-character-
drama-romance before. This 
time around, it’s just been thinly 

reskinned as a sci-fi movie.

Asa 
Butterfield 
(“Miss 

Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar 
Children”) stars as Gardner, a 
fish-out-of-water boy, born on 
a human colony on Mars, who 
is destined to charm everyone 
he 
meets 
with 
his 
other-

worldliness. Gardner wants to 
go to Earth to find his father, 
but he can’t go to Earth because 
— and this is completely serious 
— his heart is just too darn big. 
Still, it’s nothing a little bit of 
poorly explained surgery can’t 
cure, or rather, postpone until 
it’s convenient to the plot, and 
it’s not long before Gardner is 
off to Earth.

Once there, he meets up 

with Tulsa (Britt Robertson, “A 
Dog’s Purpose”), a collection 
of half-baked character molds 

crammed into a single teenage 
girl who he met online and who 
follows him on his journey with 
no questions asked. Together, 
they strike off on a road trip 
backed by an unending parade 
of sappy soft rock songs, and 
within 
twenty-four 
hours, 

they’ve fallen in love, because 
no one understands them like 
they understand each other.

Gardner 
and 
Tulsa’s 

relationship is defined by two 
things: his performance and 
her dialogue, and neither does 
the pair any favors. To his 
credit, 
Butterfield 
embodies 

the physicality of Gardner, who 
isn’t used to Earth’s gravity, 
but emotionally he just doesn’t 
work. Any scene that requires 
him to emote falls flat. Tulsa, 
on the other hand, is plagued 

with phrases like “Everyone’s 
fronting” and “See you in the 
funny papers,” both of which 
haven’t 
been 
used 
by 
any 

teenager since the 1980’s, but 
have 
apparently 

come back into 
prominence 
by 
whatever 

crudely 
defined 

future 
period 

in 
which 
“The 

Space 
Between 

Us” takes place. 
Eventually, after 
a few of the most 
excruciatingly 
hard-to-watch 
romance 
scenes 

since George Lucas gifted the 
world “Attack of the Clones,” 
Gardner and Tulsa give into 
their feelings and engage in 
ludicrously 
out-of-place 
off-

screen sex. It would almost 
be glorious if it weren’t so 
awkward.

Besides the fact that almost 

every line of dialogue and 
character 
interaction 
feels 

copy-and-pasted 
from 
other, 

better movies, the biggest issue 
with “The Space Between Us” 

is 
that 
it 
lacks 

confidence. It is 
unsure 
of 
itself 

at 
every 
turn. 

It 
can’t 
decide 

whether 
or 
not 

Gardner is socially 
maladjusted; 
halfway 
through 

the first act, it just 
springs it on the 
audience. 
Then, 

it 
can’t 
decide 

how 
socially 

maladjusted Gardner is. He 
starts out normal, then has a 
working knowledge of Earth, 
but by the halfway point he 
doesn’t even know what a 
horse is. It can’t decide on the 
relationship between Nathaniel 
Shepherd 
(Gary 
Oldman, 

“Criminal”), the founder of the 

Mars mission, and Gardner, a 
bond which should define the 
film from the outset, but which 
takes so many twists and turns 
that it’s hard to get a handle on.

Coming into the third act, 

“The Space Between Us” is 
already on thin ice, but it’s the 
climax and the accompanying 
twist 
which 
take 
it 
from 

boring and generic to gleefully, 
magnificently 
stupid. 
Not 

only do the final ten minutes 
undo, or otherwise ignore, all 
of the work done on several 
characters, but nothing that 
happens 
makes 
any 
sense. 

There was no foreshadowing 
to what happens, and the film 
must then spend so much time 
wrapping up the consequences 
of that one bad decision that it 
forgets to give resolutions to 
half of the plotlines it already 
started. It ends as paradoxical 
as it began, now a film that 
feels overlong yet lacking any 
satisfying ending.

Much 
of 
the 
stigma 

surrounding young adult novels 
is undeserved. People point 
to the tired tropes of the most 
laughable YA novels as being 
representative of the whole 
genre — love triangles, mean 
boys in leather jackets with 
secret crushes, bland female 
protagonists named Elektra or 
Aurora or whatever, nouns being 
unnecessarily capitalized in the 
place of actual worldbuilding, 
etc. 
And 
yes, 
these 
tropes 

are pervasive and annoying, 
but they’re window dressing. 
They’re never at the heart of 
what 
makes 
teenagers 
love 

young adult books.

Cliché is not the same as bad. 

If this were true, then I guess we 
all would really hate “Star Wars.” 
After all, it’s home to all those 
dumb tropes like love triangles, 
mean boys in leather jackets and 
the 
egregiously 

capitalized 
Empire 
and 

Republic. 
Many 
of 
the 

surface-level YA 
criticisms 
have 

much more to do 
with derision of 
teenage girls and 
the things made 
for/written 
by 

women than they 
do concerns over 
actual 
literary 

quality, but I digress.

What I’m trying to get at 

here is that a book that features 
corsets 
and 
enchantments 

and not one, but two mean 
boys in leather jackets with 
hidden hearts of gold, is not 
inherently dumb or bad. Silly? 
Yes. Ridiculous wish-fulfillment 
fantasy? Absolutely. Fun as hell? 
But of course.

Stephanie Garber’s “Caraval” 

is 400 pages of pure pulp joy. 

The 
protagonist, 
Scarlett 

(spoiler: she wears many red 
dresses, 
because 
of 
course 

she does) is the daughter of a 
powerful, ruthless and violent 
man who terrorizes her and her 
sister Tella (short for Donatella, 
because of course it is). Scarlett 
is engaged to be married to a man 
she has never met, 
but 
she 
secretly 

dreams of seeing 
Caraval, an annual 
performance 
where the audience 
participates in a 
Hunger 
Games 

minus the murder 
(well, kind of) style 
of 
competition. 

Caraval 
is 
a 

weeklong experience in which 
participants stay on a magical 
island where they solve a series 
of riddles, competing to see 
who can get to the end of the 
puzzle first. With the help of the 
mysterious sexpot sailor Julian 
(Leather Jacket Boy #1), Scarlett 

and 
Tella 
are 

whisked 
away 

to 
the 
show, 

where Tella is 
immediately 
kidnapped 
by 

the 
magical 

mastermind 
Legend, 
who 

is 
also 
the 

organizer 
of 

the 
event. 
In 

this 
year’s 

competition, 
whoever 
finds 

Tella first is the winner of the 
Caraval. It’s up to Scarlett, with 
the help of Julian, to find Tella 
and return home in time for her 
wedding.

“Caraval” is so easy to poke 

fun of. In this novel, there is no 
such thing as too many adjectives 
or too many synonyms for the 
color red (“cerise”? Really?). 
There is — no joke — a character 
named Dante (Leather Jacket 
Boy #2, duh) who has completely 

unironic tattoos of black roses 
and falcons on the backs of his 
hands and neck. There are many, 
many extended sequences of 
Scarlett and Leather Jacket Boys 
being forced into increasingly 
hilarious situations where they 
have to stand really really close 
together and make breathtaking 

eye 
contact. 

At 
one 
point, 

Scarlett says the 
word “scoundrel” 
with 
complete 

sincerity, 
and 

LJB#1 is honestly 
offended.

And 
yet, 

Stephanie Garber 
is no dummy. She 
knows 
exactly 

what kind of book she’s writing 
and never shies away from the 
ridiculousness. Garber works 
entirely within familiar YA 
story structures, but she clearly 
understands exactly how to 
maximize traditional narratives 
to be their very best. Every 
character 
is 
well-developed, 

interesting 
and 
complicated 

(except for Dante, but I mean, the 
dude’s name is Dante. It would 
be a little redundant if he had a 
personality). The relationships, 
though 
predictable, 
develop 

organically 
and 
believably. 

And the plot twists may be 
numerous, but they make sense 
and work within the larger 
story. Structurally, this book is 
precisely written and airtight 
in its construction, building in 
momentum by the page. 

“Caraval” has its flaws, and 

it may be silly, but it works. A 
functional, entertaining and 
effective story is no easy thing 
to write, especially within 
traditional 
YA 
frameworks, 

from which people often expect 
the worst. It’s melodramatic 
and 
deeply 
entertaining. 

Ridiculous 
and 
glorious. 

All hail “Caraval.” Here to 
remind us just how weird and 
wonderful YA can be.

All hail ‘Caraval,’ and all 
hail the young adult novel

Persian 
hip-hop 
is 
a 

relatively 
new 
concept 
in 

Iran. It rose to prominence 
during the early 2000s, mainly 
through the help of Mahdyar 
Aghajani, a record producer 
born and raised in Tehran. 
Under him, Persian hip-hop, 
or 
‘021’ 
music, 
expanded 

past just a carbon copy of its 
American 
predecessor. 
021 

music became a genre that was 
singularly Iranian; Aghajani’s 
fusion 
of 
Middle 
Eastern 

harmonies with modern hip-
hop and electronic elements 
helped create a space within 
the fabric of society for other 
young artists to showcase their 
music.

It 
was 
under 
Aghajani’s 

production 
that 
Jangale 

Asfalt (translated to “Urban 
Jungle”) by Iranian rapper, 
Hichkas, 
was 
created. 
It’s 

considered one of Iran’s first 
hip-hop albums: A blend of 
conventional 
instruments, 

such 
as 
the 
santoor 
and 

tombak, 
with 
pounding 

electronic beats serves as the 
backdrop to Hichkas’s smooth 
rapping.

Many songs, like “Dideh 

Va Del,” feature a chorus 
overflowing with echoes of 
traditional 
vocals 
encased 

within 
verses 
that 
rap 

observations of Iran’s current 
social climate. Other songs, 
like 
“Vatan 
Parast,” 
mute 

classical instruments to allow 
more modern hip hop elements.

What 
these 
songs, 
and 

Jangale Asfalt as a whole, did 
was aid in producing a form 
of expression that belonged 

solely to the Iranian youth.

In Iran, there is a gaping 

disconnect between the older 
generation and the younger. I 
see it in the way my parent’s 
friends disdainfully talk about 
“the youth,” the way they fail 
to uphold customary Persian 
ideals, seeming to toss an 
illustrious history into the 
dirt. There seems to be an 
understanding lost between 
these two generations, a lack 
of communication that breeds 
muted resentment.

After all, the older generation 

of Iran had lives shattered by 
change. In the chaotic void 
following the infamous 1978 
revolution, with many citizens 
fleeing their home country and 
various political regimes vying 
for power, it seems that the 
people of Iran lost sight of both 
their national and self-identity.

Iran 
is 
a 
country 
of 

division, 
between 
people 

and people, between people 
and government and, most 
importantly, between people 
and their sense of nationalism: 
What it means to be proud of 
being Iranian. It is a country 
that 
tries 
to 
forget 
the 

pandemonium of its recent past, 
glossing over the complexities, 
trying to reclaim its historic 
grandeur and prestige without 
ever discussing the root of the 
problem. I see this issue within 
my own family; my parents 
choosing to never elaborate 
on their experiences during 
the political upheaval of the 
’70s, and I, in turn, not truly 
grasping the extent of the 
revolution’s impact on their 
lives until just recently. 

The lack of communication of 

the difficulties and fears from 
both sides of the generational 
gap causes the older generation 
to chastise the youth; they see 
the new clothes, new slang 
and new music and only see an 
abandonment of the principles 
so strongly fought for during 
the ’70s. 

But there is a difference 

between change that is forced 
onto a community and change 
that is enacted from within a 
community. After all, viewing 
as an outsider, there is so much 
lost to the eye: Individual 
stories are hidden, the intricate 

details crushed beneath the 
grand scope of the big picture.

Iranian 
hip 
hop 
is 
not 

American 
hip 
hop 
simply 

translated into Farsi. While 
it did get inspiration from its 
American 
counterpart, 
021 

music stands independent as 
a style created solely by and 
for the Persian youth. It’s a 
distinction that many overlook, 
but one that is essential.

021 music takes American 

hip hop and incorporates it 
into Iranian culture, building 
off of ideas from renowned 
Persian 
poets 
and 
older 

styles of classic music and 
consequently 
integrating 

it 
within 
the 
community. 

Between 
the 
government-

enforced lack-of-privacy and 
the sheer restrictions people 
are placed under, there was 
little that existed intimately 
within society to solely the 
Iranian youth. Within this 
style of music, young people 
can express themselves the way 
they want to, free of judgment 
and constraint; a radical wave 
of fresh ideas coming from 
within the borders of Iran. 
021 music is something that 
Iranian youth can be proud of.

Maybe this is the start of 

a new Iran. Not that hip-
hop will cause all societal 
problems to be solved, but 
maybe this, as Iranian hip-hop 
grows in scope, will help start 
introducing the notion that it 
is possible to change and move 
forward without completely 
letting go of past culture.

If you listen closely to 

rappers 
like 
Hichkas, 
Yas 

and Salome MC (among many 
others) the gap between Iran’s 
younger and older generation 
is not as immense as it might 
appear. In their songs, Iranian 
hip-hop artists are advocating 
for many of the same values 
that 
the 
older 
generation 

yearns to return to: A unified, 
proud 
Iran 
— 
one 
that 

acknowledges its past mistakes 
as much its past successes, and 
one that is steady in its national 
identity, moving forward and 
progressing 
without 
losing 

touch with its origins.

Above all else, Persian rap is 

the voice of the Iranian youth. 
People just need to listen.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 
In anticipation of the 

forthcoming second install-
ment to the “Fifty Shades of 
Grey” series, ZAYN and Taylor 
Swift released the music video 
accompanying 
their 
“Fifty 

Shades Darker” 
theme song, “I 
Don’t 
Wanna 

Live Forever.” 
 
Pref-

aced by a trailer 
for the film, the 
“I Don’t Wanna 
Live 
Forever” 

music 
video 

echoes a simi-
larly steamy mood. Beginning 
with paparazzi cameras going 
off and a shot of ZAYN dash-
ing through the rain from his 
sleek black car into a club, the 
aesthetic 
screams 
mystery. 

The dark lighting, close-ups 
of his face and overlay of his 
sensual vocals work together 

to build suspense; throughout 
the first minute of his solo, 
you’re left wondering where 
it’s all heading.
 
And just when the 

light changes from green to 

neutral to a dark 
red, the camera 
pans across a red 
wall, 
smoothly 

transitioning to 
a shot of Taylor 
Swift, signifying 
her entry into 
the duet. 
 
Dressed in 

a blazer, lingerie 

and glittery red lipstick, she 
undoubtedly embodies that of 
a vixen; her soaring, sprite-
like vocals provide contrast 
to her dark, outward attire, 
offering an interesting inter-
play throughout the duration 
of the video.

 
Aside from the phys-

ical beauty of both Swift and 
ZAYN, the music video really 
doesn’t offer anything more 
than lust in the midst of a lav-
ish setting. There’s barely a 
narrative other than the two 
ripping their hair out in desire 
for one another; the most 
interesting part of the entire 
video may be the sparkly red 
lipstick Swift wears.
 
The fact that this 

video serves as promotional 
material for “Fifty Shades 
Darker” taints the artistic 
integrity of it; it feels overly 
commercially driven, over-
produced and extremely con-
trived. However, despite the 
intent of the music video, it 
still remains somewhat enjoy-
able to watch.

When “Powerless” debuted 

at last year’s San Diego Comic 
Con, the series made a positive 
impression on its nerd-friendly 
audience. 
Considering 
the 

spectacle-heavy 
superhero 

franchises that dominate TV 
and film, it was a nice change 
of pace for comic 
fans 
to 
see 
a 

show 
dedicated 

to 
the 
unsung 

heroes behind all 
the action. But 
even 
with 
the 

favorable reviews 
and 
burgeoning 

hype, the pilot 
of “Powerless” was almost 
entirely reshot and rewritten, 
leading to the departure of 
series creator Ben Queen (“A 
to Z”). These unfortunate early 
signs of creative differences 
point to potential cancellation, 
but “Powerless” seems keen on 
fighting against the wrath of 
ratings and mixed reception. 

Despite the show’s glaring 

flaws, it offers some hope for 
recreating the show’s original 
charm, with an impressive 
comedic 
cast, 
intriguing 

premise 
and 
cheeky 
title 

sequence. Vanessa Hudgens 
(“Grease: 
Live”) 
does 
her 

best in leading the cast as 
the ambitious, spunky Emily 
Locke, a new member of Bruce 
Wayne’s security subsidiary, 
which specializes in creating 
products for ordinary victims 
of 
superhero/supervillain 

battles. Seeing the destruction 
of her town Charm City, Locke 
is determined to bring justice 
to the city’s citizens with 
creativity, and the reluctant 
help 
of 
her 
co-workers. 

There’s 
the 
fast-talking 

technician Teddy (Danny Pudi, 
“Community”), the virtuous 
I.T. guy Ron (Ron Funches, 
“Trolls”), 
the 
hardened 

personal 
assistant 
Jackie 

(Christina Kirk, “Melinda and 
Melinda”) and the company’s 
wealthy, conceited boss and 
Bruce’s cousin Van Wayne 
(Alan Tudyk, “Rogue One”). 
Each of them initially doubt 

Locke’s 
ability 

to get them back 
on 
track, 
but 

as 
with 
most 

conventional 
sitcoms, 
she 

eventually gains 
their trust.

While 

“Powerless” 

succeeds with strong comedic 
actors like Hudgens, Pudi and 
Tudyk, the strength of its cast 
can’t make up for the overeager, 
nervous 
energy 

that 
intensifies 

the show’s messy 
execution. 
The 

first 
sequence, 

where Hudgens’s 
Locke 
provides 

some egregiously 
exposition-heavy 
narration, 
is 

beset with stale 
dialogue 
that 

continues to the 
very end of the 
pilot. 

“Powerless” 
attempts 
to 

make its characters whimsical 
and quirky through snappy, 
fast-paced interactions. And 
yet, it’s obvious that Hudgens, 
along with the other cast 
members, are uncomfortable 
with the material, as seen 
through 
the 
staleness 
of 

each character’s delivery and 
flatness of their personalities. 
Because it takes place in the 

DC 
Universe, 
“Powerless” 

also suffers from making too 
many overt references to its 
superheroes, namely Batman 
and Superman. Usually, self-
referential jokes are much 
funnier when they’re subtle, 
but on “Powerless,” they’re a 
bit too on-the-nose, like when 
Van shows Emily an awkward 
text conversation between him 
and Bruce Wayne.

Still, 
there 
are 
very 

small 
glimpses 
into 
what 

the show could have been. 
Thanks to their respective 
successes 
on 
“Community” 

and 
“Suburgatory,” 
Pudi’s 

and Tudyk’s comedic timing 
shine 
through 
the 
stilted, 

cookie-cutter 
dialogue. 
An 

early moment of conflict when 
the company can’t sell their 
superhero products bolsters 
the 
show’s 
narrative 
and 

could keep it from devolving 

into a generic 
workplace 
comedy. 
But, 

“Powerless” 
is a mediocre 
fit 
compared 

to other new 
NBC 
sitcoms 

like “The Good 
Place” 
and 

“Superstore.” 
Perhaps 
it 

might 
have 

benefitted 
from a place on 

the CW’s lineup rather than 
NBC’s, given that network’s 
bevy 
of 
superhero-driven 

dramas (“Arrow,” “The Flash,” 
“Supergirl” 
and 
“Legends 

of 
Tomorrow”). 
Whatever 

the 
circumstances 
for 
the 

change in premise and script, 
“Powerless” shows a glimmer 
of 
promise, 
but 
needs 
a 

comedic kick or two to conquer 
its missteps.

Notebook: Marody leading offensive surge

When 
Cooper 
Marody 

returned from a suspension 
that kept him out the entire 
first semester of the Michigan 
hockey team’s season, he did 
so with a bang, tallying three 
assists on Dec. 30 against 
Michigan State.

Since then, the sophomore 

forward has been a catalyst for 
the Wolverines’ offense. That 
was most evident this weekend 
in Michigan’s series against 
Ohio 
State. 
Marody 
broke 

out with four goals — three 
of which came in the second 
period of Friday’s game alone — 
and two assists.

It was the Wolverines’ best 

offensive output of the season, 
and though other issues arose 
on the defensive end, the team’s 
goal-scoring was cause for a bit 
of optimism.

“I think, just as a team, we 

got more pucks to the net,” 
Marody said. “We talked about 
that all week, getting shots, in 

all kinds of situations possible. 
And I think we did a great job 
with that.”

Marody’s offensive aptitude 

couldn’t 
come 
at 
a 
better 

time for Michigan, as senior 
forward Alex Kile and junior 
forwards Cutler Martin and 
Tony Calderone all sat out 
against the Buckeyes. Marody 
filled the void they left, as he 
either scored or assisted on 60 
percent of the team’s goals on 
the weekend.

“You 
can 
see 
what 
he 

brings even though he’s only 
a sophomore,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “...He’s 
got a knack for scoring goals, 
and he’s got a knack for helping 
other people score goals. That’s 
been missing on a regular basis 
with our whole team, and I just 
think he can jumpstart our 
offense, and you saw that this 
weekend.”

Penalty-Kill Woes
In the early stages of the 

season, the Michigan penalty 
kill unit was thriving. In fact, 
it was ranked in the top-10 

nationally at one time.

But since the start of the Big 

Ten season, the Wolverines 
have struggled in that regard, 
falling to last place in the Big 
Ten.

The unit’s struggles came 

back to hurt them yet again 
against Ohio State. Seven of the 
10 goals the Buckeyes scored 
in the two-game series came 
on the power play. Without 
those 
opportunities, 
paired 

with Michigan’s potent offense, 
the Wolverines likely would 
have come away with two wins 
on the weekend rather than 
settling for the split.

“We’re not a ‘Broad Street 

Bully’ 
team,” 
Berenson 

said. “We’re trying to play 
disciplined hockey, but we’re 
the most penalized team in the 
Big Ten right now. So we’re 
addressing that. We’ve got to 
watch our stick, we’ve got to 
watch our hitting from behind. 
We’ve got our sticks up, we 
had some accidental hooks and 
trips. I mean, come on, we’ve 
got to get that out of our game. 

It’s killing us.”

Michigan’s rematch against 

the Spartans next weekend 
could prove to be a good chance 
for the Wolverines to right 
some of their penalty-killing 
woes. Michigan State’s power 
play unit ranks last in the Big 
Ten at just 15.15-percent.

Injuries
In terms of their health, the 

Wolverines are currently in a 
state of limbo. Though Martin 
returned to practice Monday 
after 
missing 
the 
weekend 

series with an illness, Kile 
and Calderone remained out 
with 
upper-body 
injuries, 

while freshman defenseman 
Christian 
Meike 
has 
been 

sidelined with a lower-body 
injury for over a month.

In 
addition, 
freshman 

forward Will Lockwood left 
Saturday’s game with what 
appeared to be a head injury. 
Lockwood took a big hit near 
the bench area at center ice and 
remained down for some time.

He then went to the bench, 

where he could be seen talking 
to trainers with his helmet off. 
Lockwood returned to action 
a few minutes later, but was 
eventually forced to exit the 
game, and remained out of 
action in Monday’s practice.

Calderone, 
Kile 
and 

Lockwood are three of the top 
six point scorers for Michigan, 
and though Berenson says they 
are day-to-day, if they can’t play 
against the Spartans, others 
will need to step up to replicate 
the offensive firepower the 
Wolverines 
exhibited 
this 

weekend.

“You saw Cooper, he stepped 

up last weekend, and that really 
helped our team,” Berenson 
said. “But we’ve got a lot of 
guys that have to do more for 
our team, and sometimes it’s 
producing. … We have a lot of 
guys that have to help. They’re 
playing regular, they’re playing 
every night, and they’re getting 
a chance.

“But it’s not about the goals 

for — I think the goals for will 
come when you’re playing well 
— it’s about the goals against. 
That’s what’s killing us.”

Sophomore forward Cooper Marody is coming off a weekend in which he notched six points against Ohio State.

Returning players
key for Wolverines

After the final out was called 

in the 2016 season, five players on 
the Michigan baseball team saw 
their names selected in the MLB 
draft. 

First 
baseman 
Carmen 

Benedetti and pitchers Brett 
Adcock and Evan Hill accepted 
the call to the big leagues, 
while pitcher Jackson Lamb 
and catcher Harrison Wenson 
opted to continue their tenures 
as Wolverines. 

Typically when teams lose 

their players to drafts, injuries or 
other extraneous circumstances, 
a 
rebuilding 

period 
ensues. 

But 
Michigan 

coach 
Erik 

Bakich has no 
such plans.

“(The season 

is) going to be 
full of ups and 
downs,” Bakich 
said. “I just feel 
like we are much 
better equipped 
to handle it now 
than we were when we didn’t 
handle it at the end of last year.”

With 12 returning juniors 

and seven returning seniors, 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
looking 

to take a top-down approach 
to the upcoming season. The 
experienced upperclassmen know 
the ins and outs of the program 
and will serve as mentors to the 12 
newcomers to the team.

Clearly, 
Bakich 
and 
the 

rest of the coaching staff have 
looming decisions to make to 
fill the void left by Adcock, Hill 
and Benedetti, but the players 
filling their positions already 
have substantial experience 
under their belts.

“I think there are some guys 

that have a lot of repetitions 
in this program,” Bakich said. 
“They’ve logged a lot of at-bats, 
a lot of innings, been in some 
high leverage situations and in 

some tight games.”

Oliver Jaskie, who touted 

a 3.19 ERA and a 7-3 record in 
his breakout season last year, is 
only one of those players. The 
junior left-hander is poised 
to step up on the mound to 
assume the No. 1 spot in the 
starting rotation.

In the field, junior third 

baseman 
Jake 
Bivens 
is 

returning, looking to replicate 
the lofty .356 batting average 
that he posted last season.

Junior 
infielder 
Drew 

Lugbauer hit seven home runs 
last season, and his bat will 
help provide a timely surge of 
offense alongside Bivens.

With 
the 

returning 
stronghold 
of 

upperclassmen, 
fresh 
off 
the 

bitter 
loss 
at 

the end of the 
season 
last 

year, Michigan 
is 
adopting 
a 

new, hardened 
mentality.

“There are a 

lot more guys 

that we started this fall with 
that are into our team values 
and team standards,” Jaskie 
said. “We got a tough training 
this fall and we really worked 
on mental toughness. I would 
say our culture got stronger and 
our foundation more solidified.”

The Wolverines are looking 

at a schedule that will force 
them to cultivate this culture 
in a timely manner. Michigan 
starts 
the 
season 
with 
a 

15-game road trip, so a certain 
toughness will be needed in 
order to prevail over teams like 
UCLA and USC. 

After 
their 
long 
stretch 

away 
from 
home, 
though, 

the 
Wolverines 
return 
to 

the 
Wilpon 
Complex 
for 

18-straight home games, and 
with the amount of turnover 
on the team, that opportunity 
could prove to be invaluable.

“I would say our 

culture got stronger 

and our foundation

Christner looks to rebound in final season

“Last year wasn’t very fun,” 

were among senior left fielder 
Kelly Christner’s first words to 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
upon returning to Ann Arbor 
this fall.

And Christner’s words are 

understandable. The stress of 
sky-high expectations and the 
pressure to maintain success after 
a breakout sophomore year were 
noticeable in her junior campaign.

A .393 batting average fell to 

.313. Twenty-one home runs 
plunged to just six and 67 runs 
batted in dipped to 33. The 28 
multi-hit and 18 multi-RBI games 
turned into just 13 and seven, 
respectively.

Following a stellar sophomore 

season 
that 
resulted 
in 
a 

unanimous selection to the All-
Big Ten first team and a spot 
on the All-America third team, 
it was clear something had 
changed for Christner.

A much-needed asset for 

the Wolverines, Christner is 
now looking to revert to her 
sophomore 
self 
— 
mentally 

and physically — and lead No. 
6 Michigan to the Women’s 
College World Series for the 
fourth time in the past five 
seasons. And it may have taken 
this offseason for her to get back 
to that form.

After minimal playing time as 

a freshman, Christner evolved 
into a starter her second season 
with little expectations and the 
freedom to make a name for 
herself. But the self-inflicted 
pressure after a triumphant 
sophomore crusade is a challenge 
Hutchins believes is often hard 
for college athletes to handle.

“It’s my philosophy — right or 

wrong — that when kids attain 
that kind of success, sometimes 
they don’t know how to recover 
from it,” Hutchins said. “You 
feel like, ‘I’m supposed to be 
hitting .400, I’m supposed to be 
hitting home runs, I’m supposed 

to be an All-American.’ And 
(Christner) allowed that to build 
into the expectations.

“She’s as talented a kid as 

we’ve had here. She just needs to 
trust her game and relax.”

Christner shared the same 

sentiment. She hopes that a 
return to her old mentality will 
lead to similar accomplishments 
that put her name on the map 
two years ago.

“I think this year I need to 

just not let any of the pressure 
get to me and realize that this 
is my last year,” Christner said. 
“I need to kind of just have 
more fun with it, not take it 
as seriously because it is just a 
game.”

This newfound perspective 

stemmed 
from 
the 
advice 

of 
Christner’s 
sister, 
Katie, 

who played college softball at 
Wisconsin from 2013 - 2016.

“She told me, ‘Nobody asked 

me what my batting average 
was 
my 
freshman 
year 
of 

college, but they asked me how 

the experience made me into a 
better person,’ ” Christner said. 
“So I think all of us have tried 
to focus on that, working on 
letting (softball) make us better 
people.”

Along with a changed mindset, 

Christner devoted the summer to 
focus on the mechanics of her 
swing that adversely affected last 
season’s numbers. In studying 
side-by-side 
comparisons 
of 

her 
plate 
appearances 
from 

sophomore to junior year, she 
found glaring differences.

Fixing what Christner said 

were correctable mistakes and 
learning to relax in the batter’s 
box — not getting what Hutchins 
described as “tight” at the plate 
— has already paid dividends in 
practices and scrimmages.

“This summer, I really worked 

on getting back to that swing I 
had sophomore year,” Christner 
said. “And I’ve felt good since 
the fall, so I’m getting excited.”

And 
though 
Christner 

dedicated time to herself during 
the offseason, she is also entering 
her second year as team captain 
and is even more determined to 
be an effective leader — a role she 
feels comes naturally.

“I think I’ve always had the 

kind of personality to where 
I’m not afraid to say things to 
a teammate,” Christner said. 
“I think I’ve gotten better at 
knowing how to handle each 
person and trying to make them 
the best player they can be.

“Looking up to the seniors

‘M’ set for rematch 
with Michigan State

Just nine days ago, the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
(4-6 Big Ten, 14-9 overall) made 
its way to the Breslin Center 
to take on a reeling Michigan 
State 
team. 
The 
Spartans 

(6-4, 14-9) had just lost three 
straight games to Ohio State, 
Indiana and Purdue, and were 
in desperate need of a victory to 
halt their skid.

With that determination on 

full display, Michigan State put 
together a 12-2 run with 14:53 
left in the second half to pull 
away from the Wolverines, and 
ultimately came away with a 
70-62 win.

Since that Sunday contest, 

the tables have turned, and 
Michigan is now the side in 
need of a recovery performance. 
After suffering back-to-back 
defeats — at the hands of their 
two biggest rivals, no less — 
the Wolverines are set for a 
rematch against the Spartans 
on Tuesday night.

With its postseason hopes 

now 
in 
serious 
jeopardy, 

Michigan will hope to defend 
its homecourt.

“This team is a group of guys 

that just want to get better,” 
Walton said. “When adversity 
hits, it’s another chance to get 
better.”

The Wolverines’ first priority 

will be to stop Michigan State 
forward Miles Bridges. Since 
his return from an ankle 
injury, the freshman has led 
the Spartans’ resurgence in 
conference play. He made his 
leadership 
apparent 
against 

Michigan, notching a double-
double with 15 points and 13 
rebounds, 
including 
a 
few 

clutch 
buckets 
during 
his 

team’s decisive run.

“(He) can go both ways,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 

“He finishes with both hands. 
And the fact that he’s now an 
elite 3-point shooter, it’s a really 
tough guard. So we’re going to 
have to give a lot of help with 
him.”

Even if it does turn out to be a 

battle between the best players 
on each team, though, Bridges 
will have stiff competition from 
Walton. The senior guard has 
been on fire as of late, tallying 
20-point games in each of the 
Wolverines’ last three contests, 
including 24 in that losing effort 
in East Lansing.

The performance against the 

Spartans featured his season-
high point total until he scored 
25 against Ohio State, and he’s 
shooting 52.8 percent from 
the floor over the three-game 
stretch 
— 
single-handedly 

willing his team forward.

“There’s some players, and 

I’ve said this before, they 
practice until they get it right. 
Derrick’s practiced so much so 
he can’t get it wrong,” Beilein 
said. “He doesn’t practice until 
he makes it. He practices until 
he can’t miss.

“He’s become an elite shooter, 

he’s seeing the floor better. … 
He’s looking to score and then 
pass now.”

With just eight games left 

in the Big Ten season, time is 
running out for Michigan to 
turn around its conference 
fate. Walton has provided an 
example of the sense of urgency 
the Wolverines will need to play 
with moving forward. It will be 
up to them to follow his lead, 
starting Tuesday night against 
the Spartans.

“That’s the resilience that 

every team has to have,” Beilein 
said. “We’ve been able to bounce 
back enough, but we really gotta 
bounce back now. … We’re not 
going to survive unless we have 
this incredible resolve going 
forward.”

Behind Enemy Lines 

The Daily sat down with Michigan State guard Eron Harris

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Michigan State guard Eron Harris will be one of the Spartans’ veteran leaders when they face Michigan on Tuesday.

After two straight losses 

dropped the Michigan men’s 
basketball team two games 
under .500 in its conference 
season, the Wolverines will face 
a familiar foe Tuesday night.

Last Sunday, Michigan (4-6 

Big Ten, 14-9 overall) traveled 
to East Lansing to take on 
Michigan State (6-4, 14-9) and 
suffered a 70-62 loss. Tuesday 
it’s the Spartans’ turn to head 
on the road, as they’ll travel to 
Ann Arbor looking to replicate 
the results of their previous 
matchup.

Though 
Michigan 
State 

guard Eron Harris scored just 
four points in the first matchup, 
he averages 11.6 — the third-
highest total on his team. As 
one of the few seniors on the 
roster this year, Harris will lead 
his team into Crisler Center 
to attempt a season sweep of 
Michigan. 

The Daily sat down with 

Harris at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to talk about the 
expectations surrounding the 
program, the holes left by last 
year’s senior class and the 
experience of playing under 
coach Tom Izzo.

The Michigan Daily: In 

recent history, Michigan State 
has pretty much consistently 
been at the very top on both the 
conference and national level, 
so how do you, as a team, deal 
with the constant expectations 
to be one of the best teams in 
the country?

Eron Harris: We don’t think 

about that. We just think about 
being the best we can be every 
day and just trusting in our 
coaching staff. They’ve won 
championships, you know what 
I’m saying, so they have a plan. 
We just gotta listen to them and 
do what we’re supposed to do, 
and the rest handles itself. So 
no, we don’t think about the 

expectations and everything, 
you know. It shows itself just in 
the way the media portrays us, 
the fans and everybody, but we 
just stay grounded.

TMD: You lost a considerable 

number of seniors from last 
season’s 
squad, 
including 

reigning AP Player of the Year 
Denzel Valentine. How do you 
plan to be able to replace those 
key cogs in the machine?

EH: 
Well, 
before 
they 

became leaders, there were 
leaders before them, and they 
had to pick up right behind 
those leaders, and so we’re 
going to do the same thing. Our 
coaching staff is going to make 
sure we do that, and we stay 
in communication with those 
guys, and they make sure we 
know the ropes. And also, we 
have the type of culture where 
older guys just come back, 
veterans come back, and they 
just keep us in the loop, so it 
won’t be too hard for us.

TMD: 
What 
do 
you 

personally feel you need to do 
to fill that void as a leader and 
a key contributor?

EH: 
Just 
listen 
to 
the 

veterans, listen to my coaches 
and just embrace my role as a 
leader. A leader is a leader in 
life, so I just gotta be a leader 
for the younger guys and in 
basketball, just pick up where 
our older guys last year left off.

TMD: The freshman class 

coming in has been called one of 
the best recruiting classes in the 
conference in recent memory. 
How do you think they have 
adjusted to the college level?

EH: They’ve adjusted pretty 

well. I’d actually say they’ve 
adjusted very well. They’re 
already kind of used to a college 
level. I’d say we’ve got a couple 
of McDonald’s All-Americans. 
We’ve got other types of All-
Americans, so these guys are 
mature players already. The 
learning pace for them has been 
so fast, so I’m impressed.

TMD: 
What 
are 
you 

expecting them, like Miles 
Bridges 
for 
instance, 
to 

contribute to the team on the 
floor and in the locker room?

EH: On the floor, I’m looking 

for him to compete. He’s a crazy 
competitor, just very athletic, 
looking for some dunks. He can 
play from the outside, he can 
handle the ball, just looking for 
an all-around game from Miles. 
In the locker room, I’m looking 
for those guys to listen to our 
leaders, but at the same time, 
be vocal in the areas they know 
because even our older guys 
are humble enough to listen to 
them because they know the 
game too.

TMD: Last month, Coach 

Izzo was inducted into the 
Naismith Basketball Hall of 
Fame. What is the experience 
of playing under a coach who 
is widely regarded as one of 
the best college coaches in 
the country and possibly of all 
time?

EH: Well, it’s a blessing. 

I’ve been blessed to be in this 
position. Just worked hard my 
whole life and stayed humble, 
and God brought me to this 
spot, so I can’t say much more 
than that it’s a blessing. But 
it just raises our standards as 
players, raises our standards 
as humans, and I just gotta 
embrace what I’m a part of and 
let the story play out.

TMD: What kind of coach is 

he like?

EH: He’s a humble coach, 

but he’s very, very hard on his 
players. He loves his players, 
but he’s very, very hard on his 
players. He expects a lot from 
his players, and he’s about 
details. He’s a detail coach 
because we have to cover 
everything to be able to come 
out on top, and that’s what he 
wants. He wants to be able to 
win, and we’ve got to buy into 
that system if we want the same 
thing.

Kysre is key

ON WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

On Sunday afternoon, the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team trailed by nine points 
heading into the final quarter 
against Iowa. With an undefeated 
record at Criser Center, it was 
the first real adversity the 
Wolverines had faced at home 
this season.

Someone needed to step up, 

and Michigan had no shortage of 
options. Junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty — one of the nation’s 
most prolific 3-point shooters 
— was the primary suspect. If it 
wasn’t Flaherty, then the sure-
handedness of sophomore center 
Hallie Thome, or the experience 
of senior guard Siera Thompson — 
who iced the game against Indiana 
with four final-minute free throws 
on Jan. 10 — could surely do it for 
the Wolverines, too.

But when Michigan looked 

ready to accept its fate, it was 
freshman guard Kysre Gondrezick 
who salvaged the game and 
sparked the Wolverines to an 
improbable 72-70 victory over the 
Hawkeyes.

The matchup against Iowa, 

compared to similar games that 
the Wolverines were in last 
season, proved something that 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico already knew: Without 
Gondrezick, Michigan wouldn’t 
be able to make big comebacks or 
sustain 
seemingly-comfortable 

leads. A glaring example is last 
season’s shocking loss to Eastern 
Michigan, 
when 
the 
Eagles 

outscored the Wolverines 19-6 in 
the final quarter to eke out a one-
point win and hamper Michigan’s 
tournament resume.

“Last year we didn’t come 

out on the winning side of these 
games,” Barnes Arico said. “It 
took everything we had (against 
Iowa). I think it is also a sign of 
the development of the program 
and the growth of the team. … In 
the past if Katelynn Flaherty had 

an off night, we didn’t win the 
basketball game.”

In 
the 
final 
frame, 
with 

Flaherty struggling to score, 
Gondrezick wanted to put her 
coach’s sentiments to bed and 
disregard the stigma of the 
“freshman” label. The guard 
showed no signs of nerves, 
rallying for eight points, three 
boards 
and 
three 
steals 
— 

including one that was snatched 
from Iowa’s Ally Disterhoft and 
outletted to Flaherty for an easy 
layup to give Michigan the lead 
with 
47 
seconds 
remaining. 

Despite some missed free throws 
down the stretch, they did not 
detract from the greater impact 
Gondrezick had on the game.

“I feel great all the time when 

I’m on the court,” Gondrezick 
said. “I was ready. As the game 
went on I got more comfortable. 
We were shaken up in the first 
half with the defenses they were 
throwing at us. It was something 
we hadn’t seen before. … Everyone 
had a tough day at the line. I’m just 
glad we were able to convert when 
it mattered.”

It is rare to find a freshman at 

the helm of a must-win situation, 
but 
Gondrezick’s 
demeanor 

demonstrated that she was exactly 
where she was supposed to be.

“I don’t even want to talk to her 

about next year or the following 
year because each year watching 
them as a coach is so different,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Freshman 
year, as much as it’s the hardest 
year and it’s a transition in so many 
ways, it’s also the easiest year in 
so many ways because there’s no 
pressure. Nobody knows who you 
are and you can come out and just 
be who you are.

“All of a sudden you’re a 

sophomore like Hallie Thome 
at the top of everyone’s scouting 
report. Then you’re a junior and 
you’re supposed to be one of the 
best players in the country in 
Katelynn Flaherty and you’re 
being face-guarded and people are 
holding your shirt and you’re like 

‘Damn, I’m supposed to score 20 
points because I’m supposed to 
be the best player in the country.’ 
Kysre doesn’t know any of that yet. 
She just goes out and plays and 
she’s so fun to watch.”

Gondrezick’s 
performance 

against the Hawkeyes was just 
one piece of a much larger effort 
that garnered her a fifth Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week honor, 
as she notched career-highs in 
points (23) and steals (6) in the 
contest after scoring 19 in her 
previous game at Illinois. She 
also shot 2-for-4 from beyond the 
arc, improving her 3-point field-
percentage to .475, the fifth-best 
mark in the country.

Proof 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

improvement — and Gondrezick 
as a secret weapon — is no longer 
private. Michigan, sitting at 19-5 
overall, is now getting national 
recognition after being ranked No. 
21 in the Associated Press poll for 
the first time since week 12 of the 
2012-13 season.

While Gondrezick herself has 

helped propel the team into the 
national spotlight, her presence 
has also distracted opposing teams 
and catalyzed greater productivity 
from her teammates, too.

This was especially apparent 

during the most important play 
against Iowa, when Gondrezick 
handled the ball at the top 
of the arc to space the floor, 
ultimately leaving the paint 
open 
for 
sophomore 
guard 

Nicole Munger to receive a 
swing pass in the corner, drive 
the baseline and score with 27 
seconds left to seal the contest 
for the Wolverines. And that’s 
only one example.

Unless Michigan endures an 

epic collapse in its final six games, 
it finally looks poised to make 
— and compete — in the NCAA 
Tournament. It can largely thank 
Gondrezick for that.
