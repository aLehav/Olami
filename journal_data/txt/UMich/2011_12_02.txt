Lawmakers remove
clause punishing
bullying based on
gender, religion
ByANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Since state Sen. Rick Jones
(R-Grand Ledge) was elected in
2004, he has supported an anti-
bullying law that would have
protected bullying victims like
his son and the granddaughter
of one of his former colleagues.
Until this week, his efforts had
received little response from the
state government.
On Tuesday, the state Senate
passed Matt's Safe School Law,
a bill that will require all school
districts in Michigan to imple-
ment anti-bullying policies. The
bill is waiting Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's signature and state
lawmakers, and spokespeople for
the governor say they expect him
to sign it within the next week.
The bill's passing ended weeks
of wrangling between Demo-
crats and Republicans regarding

the measures included in the bill.
Republicans, who voted 88-18 in
the House and 35-2 in the Sen-
ate, favored taking out of the law
enumerations - listings of char-
acteristics like gender, religion
and sexual orientation for which
students cannot be bullied - and
reporting requirements to the
state.
Ani Adler, press secretary for
Speaker of the House Jase Bol-
ger (R-Marshall), said he pre-
ferred that enumerations not be
part of the lawbecause they may
encourage more opportunities
for bullying.
"As soon as you make a list-of
reasons why someone should not
be bullied, you open the door to
comingup with reasons why bul-
lying should be OK," Adler said.
"Whereas if you leave it general,
and you say bullying is wrong for
everyone - doesn't matter what
the reason is or who's doing or
why they're doing it - we felt
that provided more protection
for everyone."
In an interview two weeks
ago, state Sen. Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) called the Repub-
licans' view of enumerations a

Museum patrons can look
forward to new exhibits at the
University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art due to a recent grant
that is the largest amount of
grant funding the museum has
received.
The Andrew W. Mellon

tion with students and faculty
according to UMMA Director
Joseph Rosa said.
"(The director of the founda-
tion) was very intrigued about
the direction the museum was
taking and how we are collabo-
rating more on campus," Rosa
said. "(UMMA is) doing things
on campus, but at the same time
looking at the world, using fac-
ulty and students as a vehicle

host guest curators and faculty
members, Rosa said. The grant
will also support teaching and
learning initiatives.
Rosa said the museum is in
the process of beginning a series
of exhibitions called "Flip Your
Field" where faculty members
examine topics not in their spe-
cialty and share why they find
the topic interesting.
"The purpose is to show stu-

mind to thinking," Rosa said.
Through its grants, the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
aims to help improve institu-
tions, improve collaboration
between those who fund and
receive grants and support "ini-
tiatives with long time hori-
zons," the foundation's website
states.

CIRCLE OF LIFE

Aikens Commons
closed to non-Law

A decision by the Law School
this week will restrict the times
non-Law students can find refuge
in the quiet of the Law Library.
Part of the west end of the
Reading Room in the Law

to a Nov. 28 e-mail sent to Law
students from David Baum, the

Law School's assistant dean for
student affairs.
Before Aikens Commons
opened on Sept. 7, there was no

By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
When Rackham student
Christina Hajj started her
Peace Corps project in south-
west China in 2009, she was

confident that the group of high
school girls she was working
with would be excited about
increasing the awareness of
HIV and AIDS. To Hajj's sur-
prise, the girls refused to par-
ticipate.
Hajj said the 30 girls later
told her that HIV or AIDS are
"not a problem for China - let's
not talk about it."
Returning members of the
Peace Corps marked the 23rd
annual World AIDS Day - held
every Dec. 1 - by sharing their

experiences educating commu-
nities about the deadly disease
at a forum on campus yesterday.
Last year, the Peace Corps
sent 4,000 volunteers around
the world to help people adopt
healthy behaviors and assist
communities in mitigating the
effects of HIV and AIDS. Even
if their projects weren't health-
related, 90 percent of the volun-
teers worked on HIV and AIDS
education. AIDS affects 33

Baum said the new restric-

high-volume times are intended
to foster an environment more
conducive to learning.
"With the addition of the
Commons, Law students for the
first time have space right in the
Law Quadrangle in which they

wrote. "Having such an envi-
ronment in which they can work

non-Law students during finals

be reserved for Law students,
faculty and staff at all hours
during finals periods, according
to Baum's e-mail.
Second-year Law School stu-

supports the new policy because
it provides more space for Law

said she and her peers often
struggle to find open tables and
found it hard to concentrate
with the amount of noise in Aik-

"It's nice because you don't
have to go hunt for a spot in

definitely say it's been easier."

'U' study shows specialized
face-learning ability in wasps

Researchers
shocked by insects'
recognization of
wasp faces
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Wasps and humans don't have
much in common, but a Univer-
sity study published yesterday
in the journal Science ties them
together in an unexpected bio-
logical way.
The study, authored by Rack-
ham student Michael Sheehan
and Elizabeth Tibbetts, assistant
professor of ecology and evolu-
tionary biology, links the evolu-
tion of specialized face-learning
mechanisms of humans and
wasps. The paper suggests paper
wasps - a species also called
umbrella wasps - learn the faces
of fellow wasps with mecha-
nisms different from those used
to identify other objects. This
is the first study to show such a
high level of specialized facial-
recognition in insects, Sheehan
said.
Sheehan and Tibbetts began
the study in 2008 when they
developed a new method for
training wasps. The technique
was the basis for their study,
in which they attached vary-
ing image pairs to the fork of
a T-shaped maze. The images
included different paper wasp
faces, caterpillar faces, shapes
and computer-altered wasp
faces.
In each trial, Sheehan and Tib-
betts arbitrarily selected which
of the two images would be the

"correct" choice and applied a
mild shock when a wasp touched
the "incorrect" image. Sheehan
and Tibbetts trained 12 wasps
for each pair of images, and each
wasp participated in 40 con-
secutive trials for the same set of
images.
The results indicated that
the wasps chose the "correct"
image of an unaltered wasp face
about three-fourths of the time
- significantly more often than
between two images of geomet-
ric shapes, caterpillar faces and
computer-altered paper wasp
faces.
The team said the results
surprised them, even though
they published a study in 2008
in which they found that paper
wasps have good memories and
base their relations with other
wasps off of past interactions.
"We figured that they would
be able to learn faces," Sheehan
said. "We didn't have a clear
expectation that they would be
so good at it. That was surpris-
ing."
Tibbetts said the wasps' abil-
ity to learn faces was so shocking
that they conducted the experi-
ment additional times after see-
ing the initial results.
Tibbetts said she was sur-
prised to find that the wasps had
significantly more trouble learn-
ing computer-altered wasp faces,
which had their antennas taken
out, than they did learning the
unaltered faces. She hypothe-
sized that it might suggest paper
wasps use antennas to identify
other wasps in the same way that
humans use eyes as identifiers.
According to Sheehan, the
study's significance was further
realized when the experiment

was repeated with a different
wasp species. This separate spe-
cies was unable to distinguish
between the images and seemed
to select them at random. Shee-
han said he believes the paper
wasp developed the capabil-
ity - while the other species did
not - because paper wasps have
multiple queens per nest and
must recognize faces to distin-
guish hierarchy.
"What's cool about this is that
we show that humans and wasps,
they have very similar mecha-
nisms," Sheehan said. "But when
you compare these two species
of wasps that are really similar
- more similar in their lifestyles
than humans and chimpanzees
are - they are totally different
in the way they're able to learn
Evolution has shaped not just
that they're better or worse at
learning visual things but that
they're better at learning faces.
It's kind of bizarrely specific."
Sheehan said the study could
be the starting point for fur-
ther exploration of evolutionary
facial recognition development
in humans.
"It sets up an interesting
system of studying cognition,"
he said. "It might tell us what
aspects of specialization in
humans are specific to humans."
Sheehan added that he did not
know how or, biologically speak-
ing,whythe wasps developed the
specialized cognition. Sheehan
said this question might be an
area for future research.
Tibbetts added that another
possibility could be to further
study the nature of the special-
ized mechanism for face learning
and the differences between the
two wasp species.
strong anti-bullying policies in
place or not.
"The school districts that are
serious about addressing bully-
ing will continue to be serious
about addressing bullying, and
th school dstxjctS xthat ae not..
serious about addressing bul-
lying will, because of this new
law, be able to easily check off a
box that they made a policy, and
they'll continue to not give it
the attention it deserves," Irwin
said.
The Ann Arbor public school
system has an anti-bullying poli-
cy that outlines the definitions of
bullying and harassment and the
punishments for those actions,
Ann Arbor Public Schools Super-
intendent Patricia Green said in
an interview last month. The
policy includes enumerations
such as race, color, nationality,
sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity and "any other distinguish-
ing characteristics."
Liz Margolis, spokeswoman
for the district, said she believes
the policy effectively shields stu-
dents from all forms of bullying.
"I think we need to have some
kind of a list to start out, but it
also allows us to have an opening
in case other things come up,"
Margolis said.
If the bill becomes law, she
added, the district will exam-
ine its policy in a few months to
ensure it is up tostate standards.
Margolis predicted the law
would not significantly affect
the district's policy because it is
already so inclusive.
"It's nice to see that the state

has come through and sup-
ported an anti-bullying policy
for schools," Margolis said. "We
have felt the need for that for a
long time."

UMMA
From Page 1
at UMMA, said the museum will
work with more faculty, guest
curators and students.
"We are going to bring in
exhibitions curated by faculty
and guest curators who are
scholars and artists as well as
working with young people on
campus in various stages of their
career and assisting them to
become future museum profes-
sionals," Slavin said.
UMMA already collaborates
with students in teaching and
learning activities, Slavin said.
The museum has a student pro-
gramming board and serves
approximately 15,000 students
a year in various programs,
according to Slavin.
"We strive to be even more
deeply integrated into the

teaching and learning mission
of Michigan, and this grant is a
huge aid tos to help us accom-
plish our goals," Slavin said.
In March 2009, UMMA com-
pleted a $41.9 million renova-
tion and expansion that added
the 53,000 square-foot Max-
ine and Stuart Frankel and the

Rosa said UMMA aims to
make art more accessible and
relatable to a wider audience
with the funding from the
grant.
"Our mission is to take our
collection and produce shows
from it, bring in shows and look
at the creative side of it," Rosa
said. "It makes art part of every
day existence. It is seeing art
through a new lens - not just
what one assumes what art must
be - making it a part of every
daylife."


AIDS
From Page 1
2 million people die of AIDS
every year according to a United
Nations report.
Hajj, a graduate student in
the Ford School of Public Policy,
said the virus and disease are
not openly discussed in China,
so she had to spend nearly two
years building rapport within
the community before people
would speak with her about
them.
"The girls really appreciated
it afterwards," Hajj said. "They
couldn't believe that somebody
was so open to talk about it."
Rackham student Elizabeth
Renckens said she encountered
a similar stigma toward discuss-
ing the disease in the western
African nation of Togo, where
she was stationed from 2006 to
2008. While people were open to
talking about HIV and AIDS as
a general problem, she said there
is a stigma in Togo concerning
individuals who are affected by
it. As a result, people with HIV
don't seek the treatment they
need.
"Coming out and saying that
you have HIV is extremely
uncommon, which also means
getting treatment for it becomes,
-extremely difficult," .Renckens
said. "And this also perpetuates
the disease because then people
don't take the precautions they
need to be taking to have safer
sexual relationships."
Spreading information about
HIV and AIDS in Togo was
another problem the volunteers
faced. To educate people, Renck-
ens participated in AIDS Ride,
in which volunteers rode bikes
to rural and remote villages over
a five-day period. During this
time, the volunteers led educa-
tion sessions about HIV by per-
forming skits and lectures for
residents.
Like Hajj, Rackham stu-
dent Scott Burgess, a Univer-
sity Peace Corps coordinator,

worked with schools to increase
HIV and AIDS education. Dur-
ing his service in Paraguay from
2007 to 2009, Burgess traveled
the country with a group of 40
high school students and spoke
on radio shows about health and
sex education.
Burgess said in an interview
at yesterday's event that schools
in Paraguay don't teach students
to have safe sex. Through his
project, he integrated sex educa-
tion into the curriculum.
"They didn't have any sex ed
in the middle schools or high
schools whatsoever," Burgess
said. "If kids got any sort of talk
like that it was informal or in the
family."
The purpose of Burgess's
project was to start a dialogue
among the high school stu-
dents to promote HIV and AIDS
awareness.
"Students really learn a lot
better from other students,"
Burgess said. "It's really hard to
hear that from people like teach-
ers or talking with family."
School of Public Health stu-
dent Theresa Dreyer said she
went to yesterday's presentation
because she is interested in vol-
unteering for the Peace Corps
and working internationally in
the health field. A position in
the Peace Corps maybe easier to
-obtain than a job-in health care,
she added.
"Any entry-level position that
you have is going to have 200
applicants for the same position;
it's highly competitive," Dreyer
said. "Peace Corps will take you
without five to 10 years of work
experience, which most people
ask for."
Also in attendance at yes-
terday's event, School of Public
Health student Linda Schultz
said she has worked in Japan,
but would like to apply her expe-
rience working in health clinics
in a developingcountry.
"I'd be willing to go any-
where," Schultz said. "You

GORDON
From Page 1
Gordon represents former
Michigan Student Assembly
President Chris Armstrong,
who Shirvell claimed was pro-
moting a "radical homosexual
agenda" as leader of the stu-
dent government.
Gordon said in an interview
yesterday that Shirvell's "accu-
sation" of Gordon's interfer-
ence, which was filed on Oct.
27, is "truly absurd." Shirvell
also filed a motion on Nov. 17
to have her removed from the
case. Gordon's motion claims
Shirvell is trying to prevent her
from representing Armstrong
because Shirvell knows he is
"no match for Gordon in the
Armstrong litigation."
Gordon said she is confi-
dent the court will dismiss
Shirvell's counts, including
his claim that she unfairly
influenced special investiga-
tor Mike Ondejko during his
investigation of Shirvell for
"job-related impropriety."
"I can't predict what any
judge or court is going to do,
but it seems to me like a really
clear cut situation," Gordon
said. "This count of the com-
plaint should definitely be dis-
missed."
According to the court state-
ment, Shirvell's complaint does
not explain how Gordon influ-
enced Ondejko and notes that
Shirvell was at a hearing in

which Ondejko testified that
Gordon did not contact him
prior to the completion of his
investigation.
Gordon's motion states that
in his case against Armstrong
Shirvell offered a different
explanation for his termination
than he did in his complaint
against Gordon.
"Notably, this assertion
poses an entirely different
explanation for Shirvell's ter-
mination than he takes in this
case, i.e., laying the blame on
Christopher Armstrong where-
as here he blames Gordon," the
motion states.
Gordon said Shirvell's accu-
sation of defamation is unwar-
ranted and will also likely be
dismissed.
"He claims that every-
thing I've said about him to
the media is defamation, but
he claims everything he said
about Chris Armstrong is not
defamation," she said. "But
me saying he's irresponsible is
defamation?"
In the event the court does
not dismiss the complaint, Gor-
don said there will be other
opportunities for her to ask the
court to reverse the claims.
"The kind of motion I have
filed is a very early motion, and
there'll be other chances if the
court does not dismiss it at this
time (and) other opportunities
through the course of the case
for me to file a motion asking
for the court to dismiss it," she
said.

Plant seeds for recovery
Remove legal barriers on urban farms in Detroit
t's no secret that there is a tremendous amount of abandoned
land in Detroit. But that land is starting to pose an economic
danger by straining the city's resources. However, as a par-
tial solution, residents have replaced some of the blighted houses
with urban farms and gardens. While the action violates state law,
the urban farms benefit the city. The state Legislature should pass
the bipartisan bill introduced earlier this week in the state Senate
to remove bureaucratic weeds that could prevent the urban farms
from sprouting up.

The emotions ofpolitics

uring a walk through cam-
pus last weekend, a friend
told me that she figured
out the funda-
mental differ-
ence between
liberals and con-
servatives. Lib-
erals, she said,
feel personally
hurt when they
see someone else
who is under- LIBBY
served or unfair- ASHTON
ly burdened.
Conservatives
just don't. So, in her mind, the com-
plicated political philosophies of
each camp are simply intellectual-
ized justifications- for a deep-seed-
ed emotional reaction - or lack
thereof - to what's going on around
them.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
agreeing with her categorical dis-
tinction of liberals and conser-
vatives, but I think it raises an
interesting question about what
motivates our political and social
beliefs and behavior. Do our unso-
phisticated and conditioned feel-
ings about the world and ourselves
inform our dazzling and neatly
packaged sets of ideals? And if
that's the case, is it even possible to
act without the primary intention
being to gratify those basic - and
sometimes barbaric - intuitions?
One argument might be that
everyone is ultimately motivated by
self-interest and that even the most
generous, spirited person wouldn't
perform such generosity unless it
gave him or her pleasure. With this
view, the most socially conscious
political activist is no more altru-
istic than the demonized 1 percent.
The activist is fundamentally moti-
vated by his or her experience of
pleasure when advocating for the
underrepresented. The tax-evading
millionaire is similarly motivated
by his or her experience of plea-

sure when accumulating wealth.
Perhaps both have come to experi-
ence pleasure from their respective
behaviors because, in their commu-
nities, such behavior earned them
praise and high esteem.
So the activist's political stance is
no more legitimate than his desire
to be well liked by his friends - and
no less self-focused than the mil-
lionaire's tendencyto vote on finan-
cial policies that benefit him or her
and seriously burden the majority
of his or her fellow citizens. But,
intuitively, this picture seems to be
wrong. And, according to philoso-
pher Joel Feinberg's critique of this
theory of egoism, it is.
A desire can be unselfish, even
if the feelings that motivate it and
the pleasure experienced when
it's acted upon reside within the
individual. Selfishness, Feinberg
argues, concernsthe aimofa desire,
not its origin. Because the activist's
desire is to advance the interests
of someone outside himself, he is
unselfish - even though he is, as a
by-product, emotionally benefitted
by the satisfaction of that desire.
The millionaire, on the other hand,
wishes only to advance his or her
own interests.
So when our complicated politi-
cal philosophies intend to advance
the interests of others, our convic-
tions to affect policy are unselfish,
no matter how personally satisfied
we feel when we win. But what if
we intellectually recognize the
importance of behaving unselfishly
politically and otherwise, and our
emotional selves don't follow suit?
What happens when we know that
we ought to care about a particular
issuebutwe simplycan't make our-
selves feel the conviction?
The same friend who got me
started on this thought is a passion-
ate and strongly informed vegetar-
ian. Her views on the issue of food
and animal rights are nuanced and
sophisticated. She'll never make

an aggressive attempt to convert a
meat-eater and she won'tgrimace if
you ordera hamburger when you're
out to dinner with her. If you ask
her why she stopped eating meat,
she'll explain that the overwhelm-
ing evidence - from a political,
environmental and ethical per-
spective - convinced her that there
were more reasons not to eat meat
than to eat meat.
Not all our
beliefs have a
rational basis.
She relayed her evidence to me
(because I asked), and I found
myself similarly convinced. But I
told her that, for whatever reason,
this issue didn't arouse any feel-
ing in me and that I'd likely keep
eating meat because I just didn't
care enough to change my habitual
behavior. She said that she thought
of me as someone who was especial-
ly capable of acting in accordance
with principles rather than conve-
nience. What ultimately compelled
me to commit to a (mostly) vegetar-
ian lifestyle was that I wanted to
honor and act upon my distinctly
human capacity for rationality.
We would exhaust ourselves if
we attempted to ensure that every
instinct and intuition we have
matched our rational understand-
ing of how we ought to feel and
behave. But in our political stanc-
es and social behavior, we should
make an effort to introspect as to
what, exactly, motivates us. Reflec-
tion and critical thought is, after
all, human nature.

The bill - introduced by state Sen. virgil
Smith (D-Detroit) and state Sen. Joe Hune
(R-Livingston County) - would exempt
Detroit from the 1981 Michigan Right to
Farm Act. The law's original intent was to
protect farmers from new neighbors who
may move from the cityto expandingsuburbs
and complain about farms' odors and traffic
problems. As a result of the act, Detroit offi-
cials cannot approve new farming operations
because under the current law, city officials
would be barred from addressing citizens'
complaints about farming.
The possibility of farm shutdowns cre-
ates an incentive for farmers to stay out of
the city, and leaves farmers who have risked
setting up a farm in Detroit wondering if
the city will force them to close. However,
urban farms are growing in Detroit without
complaints. While these farms are illegal,
Detroit's strained resources have so far pre-
vented police from closing any farms.
Creating an exception for the farms in
Detroit makes sense, as urban farming ben-
efits the, city. With few supermarkets or
grocery stores, many areas in Detroit are
considered food deserts, and Detroiters can
only shop for food at small markets or con-
venience stores. These stores rarely carry
fresh fruits or vegetables, and if they do, the

produce is usually more expensive than the
produce sold at supermarket chains.
According to a study released by Michigan
State University, allocating approximately
4,800 acres of land for farming could pro-
vide up to 75 percent of Detroit's vegetable
needs, and help replace unhealthy pre-pack-
aged foods with fresh and local alterna-
tives. Urban farming could also play a role in
Detroit's economic recovery. And according
to Crain's Detroit Business, the 2,000-acre
RecoveryPark farming project - a joint pub-
lit and private venture in Detroit - could
add 4,000 jobs in farming, deconstruction
of vacant homes, food processing and related
operations over the next ten years. Additional
large-scale farms would help lower Detroit's
high unemployment rate and remove vacant
homes - making the city more attractive to
residents and businesses.
Detroit's appetite for fresh and healthy
food is evident - over 1,000 urban gardens
have been registered with Garden Resource
Program Collaborative, an umbrella organi-
zation for Detroit agricultural groups. Addi-
tional farmers are reluctant to move into the
city without the city's legal approval, but the
passage of the proposed bill would elimi-
nate this problem and allow urban farms to
expand in Detroit.

'Losing It' with Miller

Sexuality laid bare

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Community Culture Editor
William Miller is not a cynic.
He just happens to believe opti-
mists are not as smart as pes-
simists and says, "America has
gone giggling into the sea." This
satirical wit is how he chooses
to present himself as he mocks
everything from the aches of old
age to the naivete of college kids.
A Universitylaw professor and
historian specializing in Icelan-
dic sagas and blood feuds, Miller
has written numerous sociologi-
cal texts dealing with his per-
sonal take on anxiety, emotions
and even the theme of disgust.
But his new book "Losing It"
tackles a different subject matter
- the myth that with age comes
some sort of dignity. He said he's
positive this is not the case. For
Miller, one's twilight years bring
little more than absolute panic at
the thought of losing one's mind.
Underneath the sarcasm and
the jokes, Miller calls himself a
"pure romantic" - someone who
wants only to speak the truth
about the humor and pain of los-
ing his mental faculties in what
he terms an age of "Yahoo! and
beer commercials."
An idealist cloaked in a prickly
exterior, Miller discusses the
horrors of outliving one's men-
tal abilities in his latest book,
fully titled "Losing It: In which
an aging professor laments his
shrinking brain, which he flat-
ters himself formerly did him
Noble Service. A plaint, tragi-
comical, historical, vengeful,
sometimes satirical and thankful
in six parts, if his Memory does
yet serve."
"The fear behind the whole
book is that in our culture now a
big hunk of us outlive ourselves,
so we get demented," Miller said.
"Our bodies don't die on time.
So our brains go but our bodies,
because of medicine, keep going
- so half of the population over
85 is seriously demented."
The book is divided into three
general sections: autobiogra-
phy, history and a final section
devoted to the art of complain-
ing. Miller began the project
when he realized his brain no
longer worked like it once did.
This caused him serious distress
and inconvenience - he said he
doesn't like the idea of forgetting
the name of the president or, more
importantly, his own wife. But an
upside to this forgetfulness is that
it prompted Miller to write the
first section, which he cheerfully
referred to as "brain rot."
He is not alone. Starting at
the age of 30, the brain starts
to shrink, becoming smaller

With the culmination of World
AIDS Week tomorrow, the cast
and crew of the latest Basement
Arts production, "bare: A Pop
Opera," hope to spread a mes-
sage of activism: Anyone can
make a difference when it comes
to increasing support for AIDS
research. As such, wristbands
and T-shirts will be sold outside
of Walgreen Drama Center's Stu-
dio One before and after each
performance, with proceeds
going toward AIDS research.
"bare" depicts a group of teen-
agers in a Catholic high school
as they come of age and struggle
with their identities. The story
pivots around Jason, a young
man secretly in a relationship
with his roommate Peter. While
Peter wants to come out and tell
people about the romance, Jason
insists on remaining in the closet,
for fear of letting down his par-
ents and even himself.
The show discusses the poten-
tially tragic consequences of ado-
lescents not receiving support
from peers and family. In recent
years, groups have emerged to
prevent suicide among at-risk

"bare" examines the topic of homosexuality in a Catholic high school.

LGBT youth, said "bare" director
and School of Music, Theatre &
Dance junior Jason Kovacs.
"(Suicide) should not be
where our youth go to today,"
Kovacs said. "It does ultimately
get better."
Before social issues factored
into Kovacs's decision to direct
and the actors' interpretation of
the text, the artistic reason for
performing the show was simple:
It's a chance to explore a relative-
ly unknown piece, and Kovacs
was impressed by the soundtrack
- since it's a rock opera, "bare" is
sung all the waythrough.
"It's almost like doing a new
work, helping to find the hearts
of the characters and their wants
and needs," Kovacs said.
Initially unsure as to whether
Basement Arts had the resourc-
es to fund an entire pop opera,
Kovacs reached out to the Spec-
trum Center for additional
money, and he said the center
was more than willing to help
out. Once Kovacs got the green
light, the next task was to find a
cast capable of disseminating the
show's complex themes.
Leading the cast are MT&D
senior Sam Lips and MT&D
sophomore Michael Hartung,

who play Jason and Peter, respec-
tively. For them, the roles present
an opportunity to learn firsthand
what many face all the time.
"It's a very similar view of
homosexuality people have had,
which is the 'I'm-gonna-hide-it-
from-people view,' which is very
different from my own life," Lips
said. "My family is very accept-
ing of me, and I've never really
had to deal with what Jason has
to go through on a day-to-day
basis."
Lips does not view Jason as
the show's protagonist because
he does not think audiences will
or should root for the character.
"What he wants is to stay in
hiding while having this little
secret love affair on the side," he
said. "Hopefully, audiencesnwon't
want him to continue doingthat.
And that's somethingthat I think
a lot of people go through."
More than anything else,
Kovacs said he wants people to
understand that, even in times
of extreme crisis, there is always
someone to talk to. Whether it be
a 24/7 crisis intervention line or
anon'in a Catholic high school,
there is a shoulder to lean on for
kids facing similar problems to
the characters in "bare."

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Sophomore guard Tim Hardaway Jr. was a non-factor in Michigan's loss to
Virginia on Tuesday night.

MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Even after the Michigan
women's basketball team's
74-65 loss to No. 6 Maryland on
Wednesday night, its 7-1 start is
the best since coach Kevin Bors-
eth was hired in 2007.
Four of the Wolverines' seven
games have been won by a mar-
gin of six points or less, and.
though they lost to the Terra-
pins by nine points, the Wolver-
ines kept it close for the entire
game.
"It seems that we somehow
just find a way to pull it out
at the end of the games," said
senior guard Courtney Boylan.
"Last year, we lost some of those
games and this year we've come
out on top."
As a smaller team - start-
ing three guards without a true
center - Michigan has had
trouble rebounding in the past,
especially against bigger teams.
Junior forward Rachel Scheffer
is the Wolverines tallest starter
at 6-foot-1. But it hasbeen less of
an issue this season
"Although (the post players)
may not be the ones getting
the rebounds, they're the ones
boxing out," said junior guard
Jenny Ryan. "They may not
show up on the stat sheet, but
they're getting the big girls out
of the way for us little guards to
come in and grab the ball, and
that has been a big difference
maker."
This strategy of clearing the
floor so the smaller guards can
rebound has worked so far, as
Boylan and Ryan are the team's
leading rebounders, Opponents
have averaged only one more
rebound per game than the
Wolverines this season; Michi-
gan was outrebounded by eight
per game a year ago.

"I think we've done a better
job rebounding (this season),
which I think has been an area
that we've addressed and got
better at," Borseth said.
But Maryland had an answer
for Michigan's strategy, as it
outrebounded the Wolverines
51-28.
Michigan's fast start can't
just be attributed to rebounding
- they've also outscored oppo-
nents by 10 points per game.
Most of their offensive produc-
tion has come from Boylan,
Scheffer and senior forward
Carmen Reynolds. Boylan has
emerged as the go-to scorer.
"(Boylan scoring) can't be
what we expect for the rest of
the year because you can't put
all your eggs in one basket,"
Borseth said. "So we're tryingto
do other things to help us score
when it gets to that point, other
than just one player."
With a roster returning four
starters from a year ago, the
Wolverines' experience has also
played an important role early,
especially at the end of games.
When the shots haven't fall-
en, Michigan has been able to
get to the free-throw line. When
the Wolverines defeated Seton
Hall on Nov. 20, the Pirates
made multiple late 3-pointers,
forcing Michigan to win it at
the charity stripe. The team is
79 percent on the season, and
Boylan is leading the way with
27 free throws and is shooting
82 percent.
"I think the big difference
(this season) is in a lot of the
games we may not have played
our best, especially towards
the beginning of the year, and
we somehow find a way to win
games," said Boylan. "I guess
our team chemistry and togeth-
erness is the best that it's ever
been."

of the few opportunities they did
have.
It was a setback for the team,
considering how much progress
Michigan had appeared to make
after tallying consecutive sea-
son-high point totals in each of
its three games at the Maui Invi-
tational.
After the loss, the Wolverines
credited Virginia's defensive
prowess.
"It seems like they practice
defense everyday throughout the
summer, and in practice, they
don't practice offense at all, it
seems like," said sophomore for-
ward Tim Hardaway Jr. "They
were just coming out (and) play-
ing hard-nose defense, locking
and trailing when we came off
our five-three (and) five-four
screens, and they just did their
job."

Hardaway Jr. in particular is
looking to return to form. After
collecting two fouls early in
the game, he was forced to sit
most of the first half. And when
he returned in the second, he
couldn't find a rhythm and scored
a season-low five points on 2-of-9
shooting.
"(Virginia) really guarded him
very well," Beilein said. "Tim is
not going to be the last guy that
comes in here with a high profile
that they pay a lot of attention to.
He's going to have to make tough
shots against (opponents), and
he had a tough night, but he'll
bounce back."
Early on, it appears that as
Hardaway Jr. goes, the Michi-
gan offense goes. Against the
hot-shooting Cyclones, that
bounceback effort will be more
important than ever.

and cost them a seat in the BCS.
Kansas went to the Orange Bowl,
Missouri to the Cotton Bowl.
Just like that season, Michigan
could be rewarded for being idle
while Michigan State and Wis-
consin beat each other up.
For Michigan to really be com-
fortable with a spot in the top-14,
it would prefer No. 10 Oklaho-
ma to lose to No. 3 Oklahoma
State - the winner of that game
would get the Big 12's automatic
spot. And a No. 5 Virginia Tech
win over No. 20 Clemson would
prevent Clemson from jumping
Michigan in the polls - some-
thing Palm and Dodd said was
a possibility. No. 17 Baylor could
also gain momentum with a win
over No. 22 Texas.
But with three losses already,
Dodd didn't think Baylor would
gain enough momentum to top-
ple Michigan.
Both experts said the broad
BCS picture is shaping up nicely
for Michigan. The SEC is expect-
ed to have two teams - whether
it's LSU, Alabama or Georgia.

The Pac-12 is expected to have
two teams - its conference
champion (likely No. 9 Oregon)
and No. 4 Stanford, which would
be guaranteed an at-large spot if
it the idle Cardinal finished No. 3
or No. 4 in the standings.
Then the ACC, Big 12 and Big
East are all expected to have no
more than one team in the BCS
Standings - even if the fifth-
ranked Hokies or third-ranked
Cowboys lose and compete for
the last at-large spot.
Why? Michigan's brand is that
much bigger.
"Oh my gosh, yes," Palm said
of picking Michigan ahead of
other potential at-large teams
like Virginia Tech, Oklahoma
State and No. 11 Kansas State.
"There are three teams with
better brand power than Michi-
gan. There are three. And Kan-
sas State? Not a chance. It's Ohio
State, Notre Dame and maybe
Penn State. That's pretty much
it. Michigan is in a class by itself,
with very few peers."
Once the Wolverines are in

the top-14, their destination
will most likely be the Sugar
Bowl, if LSU and Alabama have
a rematch in the National Cham-
pionship game. If that were the
case, the Sugar Bowl would have
first pick of the at-large teams
having lost its SEC team to the
championship game (assuming
Georgia loses to LSU and doesn't
punch its own ticket to the Sugar
Bowl).
The pool of four at-large bids
would then include No. 6 Hous-
ton (who guarantees a BCS spot
with a win Saturday), Stanford
(who is likely to be guaranteed a
spot), and the Big East champion,
who is also guaranteed a spot.
Then one spot would be left for
Michigan, and the Wolverines
would likely be the first at-large
selected, Dodd and Palm agreed,
even over a top-five Stanford
team.
"They would pick Michigan,"
Dodd said. "(The Sugar Bowl is)
going to lose their anchor team
(to the National Championship).
You can't rely on Stanford at all.

They would almost certainly be
there."
Added Palm: "Look, it's not
just their brand. (Michigan's)
going to bring hundreds of thou-
sands of fans. I mean, Stanford's
going to bring hundreds of fans."
On the off chance Georgia
wins and LSU and Alabama don't
have a rematch, Michigan could
find itself in the Fiesta Bowl, who
would then have the top choice
of the at-large teams because the
Sugar Bowl wouldn't lose its SEC
team. Before Michigan can be
picked, most importantly, it has
to find a way into the top 14.
"I guessthe best scenario is for
LSU to win, and then the Big Ten
title game takes care of itself,"
Dodd said. "Then, I think they're
in. I think everyone kind of pre-
dicts they'll be in after that.
"At the end of the day, Michi-
gan being back at this level
for the first time in years will
carry the day. Their brand will
carry the day. Overall, I think it
looks really good for them, just
because two of the three above
them are goingto lose."
Simply put, Michigan fans,
root for LSU to beat Georgia and
hope Michigan hops whoever
loses the Big Ten Championship
game.
Michigan hasn't made it to
a BCS bowl game since former
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr led
his team to the Rose Bowl on
January 1, 2007.
Hoke will find out if he
brought the Wolverines back
Sunday at 8:15 p.m. when ESPN
reveals the final BCS standings
and announces who's playing
where.
Palm put Michigan's chances
of playing in a BCS game at "75
or 80 (percent)."
"They need things to go their
way, of course, but I like the
chances of things going their
way," he said.
"I think it would be 80 per-
cent," added Dodd. "I'm doing
my-bowl picks at the end of my
column on Friday, and I'm not
even thinking about it. I'm just
putting (Michigan) in."

he co-authored with John Bacon
"Bo's Lasting Lessons," explained
that he would challenge his
teams, "Do you collapse like most
teams do? Or do you rise to the
occasion and turn the tide."
Berenson asked the same of his
squad. ~
"We're trying to overcome
your reaction to a goal against or
something bad," Berenson said.
"Everything that can go wrong
has gone wrong."
Yet the trip to Alaska provides
a chance to wipe the slate clean.
As Hunwick explained, nobody
walking down the street in Fair-
banks will ask him what's wrong.
For the first time during the win-
less streak, the team has a chance
to get away.
Berenson will take the team
curling and on an expedition to
see the Alaska Pipeline, as he
does every year. Other than that,
there's not much to do in Alaska
other than think about hockey.

"I think it'll be good forus to be
on the road," Bennett said. "Go off
pretty much into the wilderness
and find ourselves."
The Wolverines have per-
formed well historically against
the Nanooks, posting a 41-9-1
record in the all-time series.
And the battered defense gets
to face an Alaska-Fairbanks team
(3-7-2, 6-8-2) that ranks second-
to-last in the CCHA in scoring
offense and that has been less
than effective on the power play.
Berenson suspects that Michi-
gan is better than it has shown.
"We're not far off the mark,"
Berenson said "We're not a hope-
less team. I know we're pretty
thin in some ways, but I think
we've got players that will play
better."
Friday's game takes on added
importance, both in terms of
gaining ground in the conference
standings and in terms of psyche.
"I would be disappointed if
we didn't come back with six
points," said senior forward David
Wohlberg. "That's what we need
to get ontrack. I don't like get-
ting swept, I don't like splitting
series."

anything like Michigan's current skid.

net."
The culture has invaded the
psyche of the team. Junior for-
ward Chris Brown spoke of a
snowball effect after Sunday's
loss to Union. One mistake led
to another, which led to several
more.
"If you look at the games, lately
it's been like one thing happens

and it's going downhill," Hunwick
said.
After what Michigan coach
Red Berenson and several play-
ers called one of the best eight
minutes of hockey the team has
played all year, the Wolverines
crumbled after surrendering an
easy goal to Union.
Berenson referenced former
Michigan football coach Bo
