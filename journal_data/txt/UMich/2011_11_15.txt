Regents to review
president's letter
to state budget
director
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
University administrators are
sending a clear message to state
officials: the University of Michi-
gan is important, and it needs to
be properly funded.
The University's fiscal year
2013 budget development letter
was released to the University's
Board of Regents in a communi-
cation yesterday._At the regents'
monthly meeting on Thursday,
they will vote on whether to send
the letter to John Nixon, director
of the State Budget Office. In the
letter, University President Mary
Sue Coleman questioned the new
funding model proposed by the
state - known as formula fund-
ing - and claimed that the model
poses "a new array of challenges"
for the University.
In the letter, Coleman sug-

gested that the state should focus
on measuring the University's
performance when employing
formula funding - a system
in which state appropriations
would be determined based on
universities' fulfillment of cer-
tain criteria, including gradu-
ation and freshman retention
rates.
"The objective of formula
funding should be to allocate
funding based on the value that
each university brings to the
state, so that the formula pro-
vides financial incentive for each
university to maximize that
value," Coleman wrote.
Coleman argued that the new
model ignores the unique mis-
sion of the University and may
cause the state to cut more fund-
ing. She cited the University's
educational programs and stu-
dent body of more than 27,000
undergraduates and 15,000 grad-
uate students as well as the Uni-
versity's $1.24 billion research
expenditures in fiscal year 2011
as reasons to reconsider compar-
ing itsvalue to other state univer-
sities.

Karman began her talk by

MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY

MSA seeks to fill rep. vacancies in election of international students

Only one Rackham
student running
with 10 open seats
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
With the polls for Michi-
gan Student Assembly elec-
tions open tonight at midnight,
assembly members say they
hope to fill current vacancies in
the student government.

The vacant seats this semes-
ter have resulted from repre-
sentatives from several schools
and colleges not being elected,
resigning or being dismissed
because of multiple absences
from MSA meetings. However,
of the three schools that did
not elect MSA representatives
in March - the School of Nat-
ural Resources and the Envi-
ronment, Medical School and
School of Social Work - only
the School of Social Work has a
candidate running in the elec-

tion.
Additionally, until three
weeks ago, Rackham Gradu-
ate School had not been repre-
sented at an assembly meeting
this semester. Since then, two
Rackham representatives have
attended the two most recent
meetings.

U' creates Depression Center

10 years ago this week
(Nov. 15, 2001): The Uni-
versity's Board of Regents
endorsed a proposal to
establish the nation's first
multidisciplinary center
for research, education and
treatment of depression.
The University of Michi-
gan Depression Center
brought together more than
100 faculty members from
different disciplines to con-
duct research on depression
and treatments.
The center was designed
to help the campus com-
munity, as well as people
outside the University, by
providing new job oppor-
tunities in research, readily

nuclear goals of retaliation
against attacks and discour-
aged initiation of attacks.
However, the panel
warned of the increasing
nuclear capacities of the
U.S.S.R. and argued that
developing countries should
not have access to nuclear
fuels. The best option, the
professors said, was contain-
ment of nuclear technology.
Prof. David Singer said,
"The United States has to
make an absolutely unam-
biguous decision that nucle-
ar war is not winnable."

"It's a wonderful indication
of our internationalization and
of our engagement globally -
having so many international
students here means we have a
terrific reputation for academic
excellence around the world,"
Greisberger said. "Students
come here. They want to get a
great education."
China is the largest source of
international students for the
U.S. and the University. Chinese
students currently make up 31.2
percent - or 1,747 students- of
the total number of interna-
tional students at the Univer-
sity, followed by India with 752,
South Korea with 687, Taiwan
with 287 and Canada with 244
students. , according to a Uni-
versity press release made pub-
lic yesterday.
Engineering sophomore Ken
Ling, president of the Chinese
Students and Scholars Asso-
ciation on campus - which is
primarily made up of interna-
tional students - said he chose
to come to Ann Arbor because
he knew that the University's
College of Engineering "is one
of the best in America."
Ling said he believes many
students he knows from home
who chose to study abroad in
the U.S. were seeking a less con-
servative environment than in
China.

study and to communicate with
others," Ling said.
The IE report also stated
that approximately 45 percent
of international students cur-
rently studying abroad in the
U.S. are women. Greisberger
said he has worked with inter-
national students since the late
'70s and remembers when inter-
national students were primar-
ily male.
"I think it speaks to how the
world in general is developing
where more women are join-
ing the work force around the
world, and they're seeking high-
er education here in the United
States," Greisberger said.
Greisberger also explained
the benefits of having a large
number of international stu-
dents at the University for stu-
dents from the U.S.
"It's great for students that
don't have the opportunity to go
abroad for an international edu-
cation because they can interact
here," he said.
Similarly, Peggy Blumenthal,
senior counselor to the presi-
dent of the IIE, said American
students benefit from sharing
classrooms with international
students.
"They become aware of the
important global perspec-
tives on whatever topic they're
studying," Blumenthal said.
According to the IIE, the
number of international stu-
dents in the U.S. also has eco-
nomic advantages. Through

"As a result of the subsequent
investigation, we were able to

Brown said.
"Our investigation continues,

While the University and
other ranked institutions have
a large influx of international
students, Blumenthal said there
is an imbalance of the number of
students the U.S. sends to study
abroad. The University is ranked
as 16th in the nation for send-
ing the most students abroad,
according to Blumenthal.
"The challenge, really, for

versities, is to be able to match

tions."
Hester's preliminary hearing
will occur on Nov. 23.
DPS was notified of the sexual
assault on Nov. 1 but withheld
the information from East Quad
residents until Nov. 10. Brown
said DPS refrained from sending
a crime alert about the incident
because they did not perceive
a continued threat. Residents
were eventually notified so they
could help identify the suspect,
but many of them were troubled
by the delay.

the strategic planning for the
civil democratic society after
the revolution," she said.
But Karman emphasized that
the path toward democracy
must come through peaceful
protests. She gave the example
of women going not with weap-
ons but with flowers to protest
in public squares. As women
participate in mostly peaceful
protests across the country, Kar-
man said she wants to see more
equality in Yemen.
"We need the nation of equal
citizenship," she said. "We need
a nation that fights corruption, a
nation, a state where law rules,
a nation where those who abuse
their authority are questioned.
We want to retrieve our nation,
and we want to become citizens
in a new world."
Karman ended her speech by
saying she's confident in the rev-
olution's achievements.
"The people have tasted it and
have made great sacrifices and
willlnot give out..." she said. "We
have blazed a path for ourselves
... and we will win."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after her speech,
Karman directed her message to

University students.
"Students' role doesn't end
in the classroom. Student-led
movements have always been
a part in changing history and
fulfilling peoples' dreams of
achieving freedom and dignity,"
she said in the interview trans-
lated from Arabic.
In an interview after the
event, Michael Bonner, chair of
the Department of Near East-
ern Studies, discussed Karman's
speech topic - the new nature of
women leading protests - and,
like Karman, said it serves as a
message for student activism.
"I really think one important
message for students is things
do change," Bonner said. "This
is something very new and very
exciting."
However, some audience
members didn't agree with Kar-
man. During Karman's speech, a
man in the crowd held up signs
against Karman, including one
that read, "Thank you Univer-
sity of Michigan for hosting a
terrorist."
But many students were
enthusiastic about Karman's
visit to campus. In an interview
before the event, LSA sophomore
Zeinab Khalil said she believes
it is important to hear different
opinions on the revolution.
"I've been keeping up with

the Arab Spring and the Middle
Eastern revolution for a while
now and just to hear especially
from the Yemeni perspective, I
think that's really important,"
Khalil said.
LSA junior Sara Awad-Farid,
who heard Karman speak earlier
in the day, said that as a college
student and an Egyptian Ameri-
can, she appreciates Karman's
work.
"I'm anEgyptian American so
this really hits close to home for
me," Awad-Farid said. "This is
the region that has undergone a
lot of political reform and social
reform, so to be able to hear
Karman come and speak of her
experience is one of those things
that you really hold close to your
heart for the rest of your life."
After the event, LSA senior
Eman Abdelhadi, president of
the Muslim Students' Associa-
tion, addressed the meaning and
importance of the University's
decision to bring Karman to
speak at the University.
"... I think it's really a sign
that this University is com-
mitted to progress and change
and that we're among the most
progressive institutions in the
world and that we're interested
in hearing from people on the
ground as events takes place,"
Abdelhadi said.

after being freed thanks to help
from the sultan of Oman and a
possible ransom payment.
Kidnappers linked to al-
Qaida's offshoot in the region
had demanded $12 million in
exchange for the three and had
threatened to kill the hostages if
ransom wasn't paid imminently,
according to Yemeni officials.
The hostage ordeal came amid
an uprising against the 30-year
reign of President Ali Abdullah
Saleh that has unraveled security
in Yemen, the Arab world's poor-
est country. Al-Qaida-linked
militants have taken control of
entire towns in the country's res-
tive south.

University Athletic Director Dave Brandon discusses sports and the economy in Blau Auditorium at the Ross School of
Business yesterday.
Brano:Football team--has
positive effect on economy

University athletic
director discusses
economic power of
Michigan athletics
By BEN SEIDMAN
Daily StaffReporter
As University Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon, a three-time
Big Ten champion under for-
mer Michigan football coach Bo
Schembechler, took the stage,
he was welcomed by the famil-
iar sound of applause.
More than 200 students and
University communitymembers,
packed into Blau Auditorium
last night to hear Brandon and
Sports Management Prof. Rod-
ney Fort address some of the
key economic issues surround-
ing collegiate sports. Speaking
as part of the Phi Chi Theta
Professional Business and Eco-
nomics Fraternity's 7th annual
economic symposium, Brandon,
who became the University's
athletic director in March 2010,
focused mainly on the Michigan
football team and its positive
effect on the local economy.
"If you think of Michigan
athletics as an economic engine,
it's pretty big," Brandon said.
"It's pretty widespread, and we
have a lot of people going, a lot
of people doing a lot of things,
generating a lot of economic
benefit," Brandon said.
Brandon proceeded to
explain that intercollegiate ath-
letics is a highly competitive
and cut-throat business.
"The pressure to win is great
because people don't show up
if the team is losing," he said.
"Ticket sales fall and you lose
your price leverage on trying to
increase ticket price because it's

all about supply and demand.
If you win, donors donate nore
money. It's funny how that
works."
Hockey, men's basketball and
football provide funds for the
rest of the athletic program, with
one football game alone pro-
ducing $15 million in revenue,
according to Brandon. He added
that to remain competitive and
attract recruits, the University
needs to make investments in
infrastructure such as arenas,
stadiums and coaches.
"There is a facility arms race
where young 18-year-old men
and women who want to com-
pete at the next level are being
recruited, and when they make
their visits, (they) ask, 'Where
will I practice? Where will I
compete? What kind of infra-
structure is in place? Is this par-
ticular school serious about the
investment they're making in
my sport?"' Brandon explained.
To meet this demand, Bran-
don said the Athletic Depart-
ment "will continue to invest a
substantial millions of dollars in
the facilities that are required
to kind of feed our athletic pro-
gram to keep it successful."
Brandon closed with a ques-
tion-and-answer session in
which students expressed their
concerns and interests about
the University's apparel spon-
sorship switch from Nike to
Adidas, the use of Michigan Sta-
dium for events beside football
games and the commercializa-
tion of the Michigan brand.
Brandon said though he has
no plans to place advertising in
Michigan Stadium to create rev-
enue, the sponsorship Michigan
currently receives from Adi-
das helps financially. Brandon
added that he hopes to see the
University use Michigan Sta-
dium more innovatively.

"I'm frustrated over the fact
that we have such a terrific
venue that we only use seven or
eight times a year, and we have
to figure out ways to leverage
it," Brandon said. "We will try
to come up with very creative
ways to leverage all of the assets
that we have - particularly
those facilities that we made big
investments in. I still very much
want to do a concert."
Fort followed Brandon by
talking about college foot-
ball revenue from a historic
standpoint. He touched on the
reformation of the football
conferences, the inability of
recessions to affect consumer
interest in college football and
Michigan's athletic budget.
"The athletic departments
are sustainable because they are
a pretty sound investment with
a pretty reasonable return given
the small amount of money the
University actually puts into it,"
Fort said.
Engineering junior Sajan
Shah, secretary of Phi Chi
Theta, and Business senior
Michael Tepatti, the fraterni-
ty's vice president of external
affairs, said they were pleased
with the large turnout at the
symposium.
"(Brandon) addressed a lot of
concerns that the crowd had,"
Shah said. "I think a lot of the
students got their questions
answered about pressing issues
on campus."
Tepatti added that the speak-
ers spoke well to issues that
affect the student body.
"We wanted to pursue a topic
that would touch on current
issues, and we want to promote
an interest in economics to the
rest of the student body at Mich-
igan," Tepatti said. "We thought
that the speakers ... would be
best for this."

Proposed plan
would reduce
monthly premiums
By MARY HANNAHAN
DaiyStaffReporter
Due to steep health care costs
for University employees, the
University's Benefits Office is
coming up with a planto provide
more incentives for faculty and
staff to live healthier lifestyles.
Ted Makowiec, benefits strat-
egist for the University, spoke to
the Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs in a meet-
ing yesterday about a three-step
plan that the University would
like to implement in fall 2013.
Makowiec called the plan the
"1-2-3 approach," in which fac-
ulty and staff would receive a
$20 monthly premium reduc-
tion in their health care plan and
another $20 monthly reduction
for their spouses or other quali-
fied dependents. The reduction
plan would span three years.
Under the "1-2-3 approach,"
employees would be eligible for
the $20 monthly reduction in
their first year of employment by
taking an assessment that deter-
minesiftheyare athigh, medium
or low health risk. Second-year
employees would need to under-
go another risk assessment along
with a biometric screening - a
brief health exam that tests cho-
lesterol level, blood pressure and
height and weight to determine
patients' risk for certain diseas-
es and conditions. For the third
year, employees would need to
consult their clinicians regard-
ing health concerns, such as
smoking and hypertension, and
work to decrease their health-
risks to receive the reduction.
Makowiec told the lead fac-
ulty governing body that the
approach would allow faculty
and staff to plan their finances
accordingly and make an easier
transition to an active lifestyle,
while becoming more engaged
with MHealthy programs. The
University has spent $20 million
on MHealthy programs such
as low-cost fitness and dietary
coaching and discounts on
Weight Watchers programs, that
are available to faculty and staff

members.
Laurita Thomas, the Univer-
sity's associate vice president
for human resources, said the
University is hoping the initial
costs will pay off in the long run
through reductions in employ-
ees' health care costs. She added
that individuals would not be
held accountable for not attain-
ing their fitness goals under the
new incentives plan. Rather, the
University will measure change
in the health of the faculty and
staff collectively.
"If there are outcomes associ-
ated with this, it is that we are
trying to increase the health
of our community and reduce
health care costs," Thomas said.
"We are not tracking outcomes
for any individual. We are look-
ing at aggregate data from the
population."
SACUA member Charles
Koopman, associate chair of the
Medical School's Department
of Otolaryngology, said though
MHealthy offers good fitness
programs, the University should
focus more on improving its rec-
reational facilities before they
expect faculty and staff to exer-
cise more.
"We don't have the facilities
to implement this," Koopman
said. "We're at the bottom of
the Big Ten in our facilities, and
if you deny it, then I'm going to
take you to Wisconsin or North-
western or Indiana and say,
'Take a look."'
Koopman estimated it would
cost the University anywhere
from $100 million to $200 mil-
lion to undergo large-scale
renovations of its recreational
facilities. He added that until
renovations happen, the Univer-
sity should subsidize employees'
-cost of using the workout facili-
ties. Membership for the Uni-
versity's recreational facilities is
$80 for the current semester.
SACUA member Rachel Gold-
man, professor of physics and
engineering, said she also likes
that MHealthy offers affordable
fitness classes, but faculty and
staff who are not accustomed to
exercising are at risk for being
injured during these classes. In
order to preventinjury, Goldman
said MHealthy should have pre-
ventative health education clin-
ics in addition to fitness classes.



COLEMAN
From Page _
In her letter, Coleman suggest-
ed that the state use the Carnegie
Classification of Institutions of
Higher Education - a framework
for understanding institutional
differences of universities across
the country - to determine the
appropriate state funding alloca-
tion for the University.
Coleman lauded the Univer-
sity's previous and current cost-
cutting efforts, but said these
reductions will not be possible
if the state continues to limit its
financial support.
With about $268.5 million
from the state for the current fis-
cal year, the University receives
about 30 percent less funding
from the state than it did 10 years
ago. State appropriations for the
University decreased by $47.5
million from the 2011 fiscal year.
Coleman added that contin-
ued investment in the University
will mean success for the state.
In an interview in September
with The Michigan Daily, Uni-
versity Provost Phillip Hanlon
said the University plans to work
closely with the state to over-
come budget challenges. Han-
lon said Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's two-year budget plan,
which includes next year's bud-
get, allows for University input.

He added that University admin-
istrators are happy to discuss the
budget with state officials.
"We're giving whatever input
we can, and we're watching and
waiting," Hanlon said.
Hanlon also said Nixon and
other state officials have been
open to listening to the sugges-
tions and concerns of University
administrators.
"We expect that there will be
a lot of discussion however they
decide to do the appropriation,"
Hanlon said.
REGENTS TO REVIEW
RENOVATIONS TO TWO
RESIDENCE HALLS
The regents will also discuss
the details of planned renova-
tions to East Quad and Baits II
Residence Halls.
The regents approved the $116
million renovation of East Quad
at their July meeting. At their
meeting this Thursday, they will
review the proposed schematic
design of the project, which aims
to improve the infrastructure of
the 300,000 gross square-foot
residence hall.
In a communication to the
regents, E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student affairs, and
Timothy Slottow, executive vice
president and chief financial offi-
cer, wrote that the Residential
College uses spaces in East Quad

that are not designated for aca-
demic purposes. The communi-
cation suggests that the project
will remedy this - making East
Quad a more suitable home for
the approximately 860 residents
and allocating more space for the
Residential College.
The regents will also review
the renovation of Baits II, which
is projected to cost about $12 mil-
lion.
If approved, the renovation
of Baits II would update the
175,000 gross square-foot com-
plex, which houses about 575 stu-
dents. The new building would
have updated fire safety devices,
high-speed Internet, refurnished
rooms and environmentally
sustainable windows and roofs.
University officials expect that
the project will be completed in
summer 2013.
Last week, University Hous-
ing announced that Baits I Resi-
dence Hall will close its doors
to the approximately 571 stu-
dents it houses after winter 2012.
According to University Hous-
ing spokesman Peter Logan, the
building's boiler systems need to
be replaced, which would cost $6
million. Additionally, the resi-
dence hall fails to meet the stan-
dards prescribed by University
Housing's Residential Life Ini-
tiatives, according to University
Housing Director Linda New-
man.

ter relationship with graduate
students. Watson also said he
would like to see more involve-
ment from graduate students.
"There is this self-perpet-
uating dilemma where gradu-
ate students look at MSA and
say we don't address gradu-
ate student issues, but part of
the reason why that percep-
tion exists ... is because we
don't have graduate student
representation to bring up the
issues," Watson said. "We need
to figure out a way to stop that
cycle from spinning itself out
of control."
Watson said one way to do
this is by implementing more
lenient attendance policies to
entice graduate students who
may be too busy to act as MSA
representatives. He added
that graduate students should
have "more flexibility" in their
involvement in the student gov-
ernment. However, the idea has
not been addressed during an
assembly meeting.
There are 10 open Rackham
student seats on the assembly
for this election. Watson said
he expects the two current
Rackham representatives to
retain their seats as write-ins.
Patrick O'Mahen, a member of
GEO and a former columnist for
The Michigan Daily, is the only
Rackham student running in
the upcoming election.
O'Mahen wrote in an e-mail

interview that graduate stu-
dents don't typically partici-
pate in MSA because of their
demanding academic schedules
and different lifestyles from
undergraduate students.
"We're at a different point in
our lives than undergrads," he
wrote. "Many of us are married
and have children."
Still, O'Mahen wrote that
MSA can positively affect grad-
uate students.
"MSA has an ability to lobby
University administrators to
better the University communi-
ty," O'Mahen wrote. "I'm look-
ing forward to working with
MSA to make sure that admin-
istrators respect the rights
of graduate student research
assistants."
MSA passed a resolution at
its meeting last Tuesday in sup-
port of GSRAs' right to hold a
vote to determine their union-
ization status.
Another issue that gradu-
ate students currently face,
O'Mahen wrote, is attaining
subsidies for child care for stu-
dents who have children.
Watson said he would like to
see more than 4,000 students
come out to the polls, achiev-
ing a "minimum threshold" of a
10-percent student voter turn-
out. There was an 11-percent
voter turnout for the student
government elections in March.
The candidates come from
MForward, the Defend Affir-
mative Party and the Michigan
Vision Party. The polls close
Thursday night at midnight.

Uphold marijuana law
Schuette should respect the desire of voters
M ichigan's medical marijuana law has once again comej
under fire. Currently, the law allows people with regis-
tered identification cards to legally possess marijuana ifj
they have a prescription. But Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuettej
is making it increasingly difficult to obtain medicinal marijuana by
arguing that Michigan's policy conflicts with federal law and should
be enforced differently. Michigan's attorney general should not be
working to undermine laws passed by Michigan residents. Medical
marijuana is legal in Michigan, and the state needs to stop trying to
limit its availability and accessibility.

Schuette released a statement on Nov.. 10
indicating that the clause in the medical mari-
juana law that prohibits police from confiscat-
ing medicinal marijuana is in conflict of federal
law. But since this has been the case since the
law's passage in 2008, it's strange that the issue
isbeingbroughtup now. Schuette needstostop
trying to make medicinal marijuana illegal
because of his personal opinion of the policy
and should instead honor the wishes of Michi-
gan voters who passed the law with 63 percent
approval. Medical marijuana users should be
allowed to utilize their prescriptions without
the fear of confiscation.
Schuette has also threatened to prosecute
Michigan police officers with drug dealing
charges if they return prescribed marijuana
to patients. He questions if officers can even
enforce the law, saying in the same statement
that doing so would be "impossible." An attor-
ney general who would seek to make criminals
out of his state's police officers is in no way suit-
able for the position. It is aridiculous and base-
less claim that returning a legal prescription to
its owner is drug dealing, and it's an insult to
police departments across the state.
A similar issue was settled in California in
2007 when a medical marijuana patient suc-

cessfully sued the police for taking his pre-
scription marijuana during a traffic stop and
not returning it. Restricting the return of per-
sonal property unduly confiscated is a purpose-
less task to try to uphold, and Schuette should
not be encouraging it.
Michigan residents - whose taxes pay
Schuette's salary - deserve an attorney
general who will work for them, not against
them. Schuette and other members of the
state government need to make the medi-
cal marijuana legislation easy to follow for
police, patients and physicians. Schuette
needs to put his personal beliefs aside and
carry out the job he was elected for - uphold-
ing Michigan's laws, including those regard-
ing medical marijuana.
Michigan's medical marijuana lawis contro-
versial among residents of the state and some
members of the Legislature. The individu-
als opposing the law, including the attorney
general, have the right to seek its repeal. But
Schuette does not have the right to circum-
vent and undermine state laws for the sake of
his own personal agenda. Schuette needs to
honor the desires of Michigan voters and help
make the medicinal marijuana law clear for all
involved parties.

Remember those question-
naires we filled out during
freshman orientation? Each
year, the Univer-
sity's Division of
Student Affairs
compiles the
data from those
forms and pub-
lishes the results
online. Perusing
the report is fas-
cinating, to say MATTHEW
the least. In addi- GREEN
tion to offering a-
standard 'demo-
graphic profile of each graduating
class, the report includes findings
on students' political views, future
plans and even self-image. Appar-
ently, 76.9 percent of University stu-
dents responded in 2009 that it was
essential or very important to them
to be "very well off financially."
This is a completely understandable
desire, of course, particularly for
incoming freshmen accustomed to
the comforts and luxuries their par-
ents had lavished on them up until
that point.
But exactly how comfortable
and pampered are these students?
The questionnaire data hints at an
answer.
For the class of 2013 (the most
recent class for .which data is pub-
lished), 84.4 percent of students
reported parental income above
$50,000 a year. More students
reported an annual family income
of over $250,000 (16.9 percent) than
below $50,000 (15.6 percent). Keep
in mind that according to the 2010
U.S. Census, more than half of all
Michigan residents make less than
$50,000 each year. Given their rela-
tive affluence, it's no wonder that
such a high percentage of University
students would expect a modicum of
economic success.
Intriguingly, about 50 percent of
students reported that their fathers
were doctors, lawyers, engineers,
executives or business owners. And
more than 75 percent of their par-
ents went to college, compared to the
27.5 percent of American adults who
did according to The Chronicle of

Higher Education in January 2011.
Reading this, you're probably
unsurprised. Affluent parents have
long sent their children to the best
schools their money could buy. It's
hardly newsworthy that an elite
school would cater to a moneyed
clientele. Mere mention of Harvard
and Yale conjures images of wealth
and status as much as it does aca-
demic prestige.
But Harvard and Yale, as well as
other prestigious institutions, have
begun to address their historic social
exclusivity. According to Harvard's
office of financial aid, "families with
incomes currently below $60,000
are not expected to contribute to col-
lege costs." Period. Yale and Prince-
ton, in addition to Harvard, recently
re-examined their early-admission
processes to ensure that the process
didn't unfairly favor well-heeled
applicants.
These actions may not have solved
the problem of wealth inequality on
college campuses,butthey've atleast
started an administrative dialogue
about makinghigher education more
socially equitable. Against a back-
drop of continually rising income
inequality, perhaps it's time for the
University to seriously address the
disparity between the rich and poor
as reflected by its student body.
More than any Ivy League institu-
tion, the University of Michigan has
an imperative as a flagship public
school to live up to its responsibility
to serve the public good.
How can the University claim
a commitment to diversity with a
demographic profile as homoge-
nously affluent as ours?
The University can foster more
economic diversity in a variety of
ways. Most obviously, the adminis-
tration could think twice the next
time a tuition increase is on the
table. According to a May 2011 poll
by the Pew Research Center where a
nationally representative sample of
2,142 adults ages 18 and older were
surveyed, 48 percent of 18 to 34 year
olds who hadn't gone to college said
they didn't go because they couldn't
afford it. Financial aid is also part of
the solution. Perhaps the University

should follow Harvard's lead, offer-
ing more sweeping financial aid
packages to low-income students.
That'd be expensive, sure. But at
$6.5 billion, the University of Mich-
igan's endowment is greater than
the GNP of Nicaragua. I think we
can afford it.
The endowment
is more than
Nicaragua's GNP.
To its credit, the University
already takes into consideration the
economic background of applicants
each fall. It awards points to stu-
dents if they're from an economically
depressed region or if they attended
an underprivileged high school. But
as progressive and important as
these considerations may be, they
clearly aren't doing enough. The
University must do a better job of
reaching out to disadvantaged high
school students before the applica-
tion process even begins.
As the Occupy Wall Street move-
ment decries the unequal influence
of the wealthiest few, it's worth
calling attention to the channels
through which they attained their
power and fortune. Many of them
surely funneled through the nation's
most elite colleges. In the parlance of
OWS, the University needs to take a
firmer stance in support of educat-
ing the 99 percent.
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to make a decent living, as
the data shows that many Universi-
ty students do. It's part of the Amer-
ican dream, after all, and young
people across the socioeconomic
spectrum likely share this aspira-
tion. It's the University's respon-
sibility to ensure that this goal can
be met by the genuine Leaders and
Best - not just the already wealthy
and well connected.

Vote MForward for MSA

The Michigan Student Assembly has got-
ten off to a very successful start this year. With
MSA elections this Wednesday and Thursday,
now is a great time to learn about what MSA
has been doing on campus. Prior to last year,
MSA had been inefficient and slow to respond
to student needs, in part because MSA mem-
bers were concerned with political posturing.
Last year, then MSA President Chris Arm-
strong demanded more from the assembly
and began the process of making MSA more
relevant to students' lives. Many members of
MForward, a student advocacy group on cam-
pus and an MSA party, supported Armstrong's
initiatives.
I joined MForward the semester after Arm-
strong was elected. I was drawn to it because it
had already begun to produce the results that
it had promised, and I wanted to contribute.
Under MForward's lead, MSA helped secure
Saturday night dining in residence halls, held a
massive Lupe Fiasco benefit concert and began
the process of having regular Farmers' Mar-
kets in the Michigan Union. MSA also won a
more inclusive University Housing roommate
policy that is fairer for transgender and gender
non-conforming students and has already been
implemented.
This year, I have been pleased to see MFor-
ward continue to improve MSA under Presi-
dent DeAndree Watson. Watson and his team
hosted a tailgate before the Notre Dame night
game and provided food and fun to more than
8,000 students. Under his leadership, MFor-
ward members have hosted many other student
service events on campus such as a housing
rights awareness week and a fair trade aware-
ness week. MForward supporters, including
myself, have also worked to reduce the inter-
nal costs of MSA so that we can redirect more
money to fund student organizations. Some of
us have renewed lobbying efforts at the state
and local levels by working with the city ofAnn
Arbor to maintain its pedestrian protection
laws and by lobbying the state to pass anti-bul-
lying legislation and provide more money for
higher education.
MForward can achieve these great things

because, unlike other parties before us, we
work together on a daily basis to improve stu-
dent life. When I want to initiate a project,
I know I can count on my fellow MForward
members to assist me in those endeavors. This
semester, MForward is running an exciting
group of students who I not only look forward
to working with, but also know will serve the
campus well in continuing the progress that
MForward has already started. They have
already affirmed their commitment to provid-
ing transparency and advocating for student
needs and are full of ideas on how to make the
University a better place.
The MForward candidates in this election
have excellent goals, both large and small. For
example, DPS Oversight Committee candi-
date Freshman Lucy Zhao will work with the
Department of Public Safety to ensure that
crime alerts are consistently sent out in a timely
manner to promote student safety and aware-
ness on campus. LSA candidate Freshman
Angela Jung will strive to better the relation-
ship between MSA and students by ensuring
that there is a larger student government pres-
ence at events across campus. Finally, Engi-
neering candidates Freshman Andy Modell
and Freshman Saketh Samaymantri will work
collaboratively to improve the bus system and
ensure that Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices has student input when making decisions.
These are just a few examples of the numerous
projects the current MForward candidates
hope to work on in the coming semester.
I encourage you to vote in the upcoming
MSA elections tomorrow and Thursday. I can-
not overstate the importance of your participa-
tion. MSA works with the University all year on
your behalf, so we need to hear your voice as
students. Voting is also easy - just go to vote.
umich.edu to cast your vote tomorrow. I also
encourage you to go to MForward.org, where
you can find the extended platforms and bios
of the candidates that have joined MForward
this semester.
Louis Mirante is a sophomore in LSA, MSA
representative and member of MForward.

Build Turkey-Israel relationship

In recent weeks, top Israeli officials have made it
increasingly clear thatthey are willing to extend an olive
branch and engage in civil diplomacy with adversarial
parties in the Middle East. Israel's recent offer and dis-
persal of humanitarian aid to Turkey in response to a
7.2-magnitude earthquake in late October is only the
latest example of Israel's sense of responsibility for the
health and safety of all people, not just Israelis. Howev-
er, when such altruism is met with indifference or even
hostility by the very people to whom Israel extended the
hand of friendship, it only serves to cast more doubts on
Turkey's seriousness as a true partner in the Middle East
peace process.
In the case of the international response to the recent
earthquake in Turkey, Israel was among the first coun-
tries to offer aid and disaster relief. However, Turkey
rejected Israel's first several offers of aid before finally
deciding to accept it - claiming a miscalculation of the
level of devastation was responsible for the initial denial.
Even still, Turkey has only accepted limited Israeli aid
in the form of temporary structures designed to provide
refuge to the earthquake's survivors, but has continued
to refuse Israeli offers to assist in the search and rescue
efforts to save victims from the wreckage. Why did Tur-
key choose to further endanger the lives of its own imper-
iled citizens by rejecting help that could be the difference
between life and death for many trapped Turks? Is Tur-
key really choosing to maintain tensions with Israel
over rescuing earthquake victims and mending a broken
friendship? It seems that way: The Turkish government
recently announced that Israel's generous relief efforts
do nothing to ease the diplomatic tension thathas existed
between the two countries for the last 18 months.
While Israel has shown itself to be awilling provider
of relief to humanitarian crises all over the world, includ-
ing Haiti and Japan, Turkey presumes that in offering to

provide for the basic needs of Turkish people beset by
tragic circumstances, Israel has ulterior motives. Indeed,
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan felt the
need last week to reassert his support for United Nations
economic sanctions against Israel, complainingthat "the
UN Security Council has issued more than 89 resolutions
on prospective sanctions against Israel, but they've never
been executed." Erdogan's reiteration of support for such
sanctions underscores the illogical Turkish paranoia that
exists surrounding Israel's offer of disaster relief.
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieber-
man has strongly stated thathe considers Israel's tenuous
relationship with the Turkish government to be immate-
rial in issuing critical aid to the Turkish people afflicted
by a natural disaster. Turkey's regrettable unwillingness
to place any value on easing diplomatic tensions with
Israel, a country that has displayed a willingness to come
to their aid and engage in normalized relations time and
time again, does not leave much hope for Turkey as a
member of a successful Middle Easternpeace process.
With every passing day, the Turkish government's
constant allusion to the Flotilla incident in May 2010 as
rationale for escalating tensions between the two nations
looks more like an excuse to remain indifferent and disen-
gaged than a legitimate claim of offense. Turkey's public
refusal to normalize relations with Israel is yet another
slap in the face to the idea that Israel's adversaries are
willing to reasonably negotiate and broker a long-term
regional peace. Instead, they would rather continue to
stigmatize isolated incidents. Israel has made clear time
and again that it can and will make overtures to other
regimes in the Middle East in order to lay the founda-
tion for long-term peace. Unfortunately, it seems that the
Israelis, yet again, are among the only ones ready to build.

after Katrina that Ward was able
to reflect on her experiences in
writing.
. "It took me a while to commit
to doing it," she said. "I think it
silenced me for a while. And I
couldn't deal with everythingthat
had happened."
The young writer spoke about
the motivations involved in com-
posing the novel. Nonfiction
had never seemed like the right
genre for her, because the themes
exposed by Hurricane Katrina
had more universal implications
than mere personal account. And
so she chose fiction to communi-
cate these subjects of sacrifice,
loss and poverty braided into the
tragedy.
But Ward also wanted to write
"Salvage the Bones" because she
was fed up with uneducated ques-
tions from people who were not
from the area.
"(They) would say stuff like, 'I
don't understand why everyone
didn't evacuate' and, 'The reason
that the storm hit the coast and
did what it did ... is because every-
one's soulless and godless,' " she
said.
"They didn't understand," she
added. "They didn't understand
the people; they didn't under-
stand the culture here; they didn't
understand the real impact the
storm had."

Ten years of courtship later
and six years after "Crazy in

kaleidoscope of atomic voca-

music for a lifetime.

Katzman was heavily influ-
enced in his childhood by many
things: his father's professional
career as a jazz trumpet player,
working in the Los Angeles stu-
dio scene and the classic music
produced by his mother's parents.
Though raised in that particular
musical foundation, he found his
own sound inspired by artists
ranging from Cuban musicians to
Led Zeppelin to Feist.
"People who care about you
want to tell you what to do
because they're worried about
you not being OK," Katzman
said. "I think that if you really
play that game and let yourself
get surrounded by that and con-
trolled by that, you can go down
the wrong path."

"Uncharted 3: Drake's Decep-

The narrative is very much an
"Indiana Jones" affair. A descen-
dant of Sir Francis Drake, the
protagonist, Nathan Drake, is a
born treasure hunter who wants
to uncover a mysterious fortune
that his ancestor omitted from
the record books. While no one
knows what the treasure con-
tains, a nefarious faction thinks
the reward could be enormous.
From there the story becomes
a race to see who can get there
first.
Much like "Indiana Jones," it's
a fantastical tale, with historical
namedrops, globetrotting and
some mysticism thrown in for
good measure. While not espe-

However, there's no doubt this
is Singing Drake's album. Some-
times, his soul-baring couplets
work: "Girl I can't lie, I miss you
/ You and music were the only
things that I commit to." Other
times, they don't: "May your

Take Care waxes on The Good

it, if only for 80 minutes. There's
no longer such a deep divide
between star and fan - Drake
could be that guy we used to
know, still charmingly startled
by the sheer reach of his suc-
cess. He's confident to the point
of absurdity ("I'm a descendant
of either Marley or Hendrix"),
self-aware to the point of nar-
cissism.
But even with all his confi-
dence, he's questioning where
he's going. On Take Care, he's
made it for now, but he wonders
if he's meant for this kind of life
("What if I don't really do the
numbers they predict?"). At the
heart of it, Drake is just a young
guy trying to figure out what
makes him happy ... and aren't
we all?

seemed like Los
nothing was
off limits to the 1 d
UK band, as it Hello Sadness
used each and
every song as a Arts & Crafts
launching point
into new levels of perkiness.
Guitars played quick flurries
of notes in the highest octaves
available to them. Vocals sound-
ed more like the chirps of car-
toon characters than the voices
of actual people. Lyrics dealt
mainly with topics of dancing
and lust. It wasn't unusual for
songs to break into 30-second
intervals of static and undistin-
guishable noise - hard to listen
to, yes, but infectiously happy all
the same. The band's spirit was
endearing: young, carefree and
maybe a little over-the-top.
Unfortunately for Los
Campesinos! fans, no party can
last forever. The band's new
album, Hello Sadness is fully
deserving of its title, as it's
stripped of the vibrant music
and attitude that characterized
the band in the past.
Simply put, Hello Sadness is
a tease. It offers glimmers of
hope in every track but is quick
to stomp them out, usually with
dull, trudging melodies or lack of
melody altogether. For instance,
"Life is a Long Time" may have
a snappy chorus, but that doesn't
make up for the monotonous
verses that infect it.

'M' prepares for unfamiliar team, familiar style

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
A quick glance at the stat sheet
is telling- the Michigan football
team and Nebraska are lined up
side-by-side in nearly every cat-
egory across the board.
Team A boasts an 8-2 overall
record, 4-2 in
the Big Ten. NOTEBOOK
Team B lays
claim to an identical record.
Team A scores 32.5 points per
game on 421.5 yards of offense..
Team B scores 32.9 points on
404.1 yards.
Team A has totaled 2,313 rush-
ing yards, led by a two-headed
monster backfield. Team B has
2,327 rushing yards with, you
guessed it, a pair of beasts in the
backfield.
TeamAis Michigan. Team B is
Nebraska. But that really doesn't
matter. Come Saturday, it's going
to be some smash-mouth, ground
'em and pound 'em football at
Michigan Stadium.
"Nebraska's always been a
very physical football team for
numbers of years," said Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke. "They
take great pride in their football.
"You look at the statisti-
cal information between both
teams, which I'm not real big
into, but there's a lot of similari-
ties in their rushing offense and
scoring and defensively - they're
a team that's going to play with
great passion."
The Cornhuskers are led by

Athletic Department officials
are urging fans to arrive to the
game early to participate in a
card stunt project. During the
national anthem, fans will hold
up 65,000 cards that will com-
bine to form an American flag.
The cards will be affixed to
seats in sections 1-23, circling
around the south endzone from
east of the 50-yard line to west of
the 50-yard-line.
"We're keeping (the cards)
away from the students, so they
don't turn into boomerangs," a
military representative joked on
Monday.
The national anthem will also
feature a flyover from four F-16
fighter jets out of Pope Air Force
Base in South Carolina. The jets
will be launching from Self-
ridge Air National Guard Base in
Mount Clemons, Mich. and fly-
ing south to north over the sta-
dium - and the card stunt.
The head pilot for the flyover
is a Michigan graduate. Plans are
to have a live video feed from the
lead jet play on the stadium's vid-
eoboards to show the card stunt
from overhead.
Pregame hospitality for veter-
ans will also be held at Ooster-
baan Fieldhouse.
"Let me tell you, it's awe-
some," Hoke said. "We all are
thankful for those who have
served this country and those
who are serving.
"Coming from San Diego and
havingthe relations we were able
to have with the Marine corps

and the Navy, it's humbling what
they do for our country and what
they do for us to be able to sit
here to today and get asked ques-
tions, some good and some not so
good."
ROBINSON CHARGED: Soph-
omore safety Marvin Robinson
has been accused of breaking
into a West Quad room in Sep-
tember. He was arraigned last
week on a charge of second-
degree home invasion.
"We are aware of the report,"
Hoke said in a statement. "We
will let the legal process run
its course, and we will not have
any further comment until that
time."
Robinson was released on a
promise to appear in court. He
will appear at the Washtenaw
County 14A District Court on
Wednesday. If convicted, Rob-
inson could face up to 15 years
in prison. Robinson has col-
lected nine tackles in four career
appearances with Michigan.
NOTES: Van Bergen was
named Co-Big Ten Defensive
Player of the Week, College
Football Performance Awards's
National Defensive Performer
of the Week and Defensive Line-
man of the Week after collecting
a career-high 2.5 sacks and seven
tackles on Saturday.... Freshman
kicker Matt Wile was named
CFPA Kickoff Specialist of the
Week after tallying five touch-
backs on six kickoffs in the swirl-
ing wind at Memorial Stadium in
Champaign.

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan defensive tackle Ryan Van Bergen earned Co-Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week honors yesterday.

quarterback Taylor Martinez
and running back Rex Burkhead.
The pair combines for 184 rush-
ing yards per game. The Wolver-
ines' duo of junior quarterback
Denard Robinson and red-
shirt sophomore running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint averages
174 rushing yards.
Point. Counterpoint
Nebraska is in its first season
in the Big Ten, but the Michigan
defense isn't concerned with fac-
ing an unfamiliar offense.
"Nebraska presents a chal-
lenge unlike any other team in
the Big Ten, I think," said fifth-

year senior defensive tackle Ryan
Van Bergen. "The only other
team that might present a chal-
lenge like them would be us."
Still, even with Toussaint,
Hoke will use running backs
Jihad Rasheed and Michael Cox
in practice this week to simulate
Burkhead's power.
The Wolverines have played
the Cornhuskers just six times,
with Michigan holding a 3-2-1
edge in the series. By every indi-
cation, Nebraska, which Hoke
called "one of the traditional
football powers in this country,"
will be right at home in the Big

Ten.
"From what I've heard,
they're a tough team, they're a
good team, they're a solid team,"
Molk said. "They're very much
like us. But then again, I've never
played them. Looking forward to
something new."
Especially when that some-
thing new is what you see in
practice.
MILITARY APPRECIATION:
There won't be jetpacks at the
Big House, but that's about all
that will be missing from Michi-
gan's Military Appreciation
plans on Saturday.


Wolverines dethrone Spartans,

Chiasson leads freshmen

team.
Led by senior captains Kenichi
Osawa, Benjamin Hubbard and
Patrick Trabert, the Wolverines
finished their season with a Big
® Ten title and a ninth-place finish
at Nationals this past weekend
in Atlanta. The team started the
season without knowing much
about its new coach, but it was
clear by the end that Michigan
had landed a gem. Long-time
Ann Arbor native Tony Ander-
son led the ninth-ranked Wol-
verines to a 7-1 regular-season
record and their first conference
championship in seven years.
"(Anderson) fits the personal-
ity of the team really well," said
senior Matthew Woelfel. "He's a
great guy and the team dynamic
is very friendly. It's a lot of fun,
but we do a lot of serious work at
the same time."
Added Osawa: "It's been a
good adjustment, a good change,
kind of like a breath of fresh air.
We've been able to work really
closely with Coach and develop
strategies and plans for games
that really fit the personnel that
we have on our team."
The change wasn't all easy,
but after a slow start Michigan
moved in the right direction.
With important wins over Indi-
ana and Michigan State, the Wol-
verines put themselves in prime
position to win the Big Ten Tour-
nament.

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
One of the Michigan hockey
team's defensive anchors is a
patient man.
Freshman Mike Chiasson
stayed patient in Omaha, Neb.,
where he played three seasons
for the Omaha Lancers of the
USHL before beginning his col-
lege career.
"It was a great developmental
league," Chiasson said. "It really
helped to advance my game to
where it is today. Not only did
they teach me to be a good hock-
ey player, but just being a good
human being off the ice."
He's patient on the bench
because he knows his shifts will
come. In fact, he's become some-
thing of a staple on the blue line
for the seventh-ranked Wolver-
ines. He's patient on the penalty
kill, stabilizing the unit by deliv-
ering a timely clearing of the puck
or forcing a streaking forward to
the outside.
The 20-year-old Chiasson sim-
ply knows that when you wait,
good things happen - like offers
from Michigan and early playing
time.
"I stayed really patient and was
looking for the right fit," Chiasson
said of his recruiting process. "I
don't regret it."
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son, too, is happy his defenseman
waited before jumping into col-
lege hockey.
"Chiasson's a little older ... and
that has shown a little bit," Beren-
son said. "(He's) playing every
night."
When the Wolverines score
a goal, look near that blue line.
Chances are Chiasson will be
there. Perhaps he started the

CHRIS DZOM5AK/Daily
Freshman defenseman Mike Chiasson has recorded a plus-14 plus/minus.

attack with a slapshot from the
point. Perhaps he brought the
puck up the ice.
Even if he wasn't instrumental
in a Michigan goal, Chiasson has
an uncanny knack for being on
the ice at opportune moments for
Michigan. He leads the team in
plus/minus at plus-14.
Chiasson gained most of the
experience that makes him such
a valuable member of the defense
from his USHL time.
"I think it's helped him a lot,"
Berenson said of Chiasson's
junior hockey experience. "He's
used to being a key player on a
defense that's had some success."
Delaying his college hockey
start has been a blessing for Chi-
asson because Berenson expects a
lot of his defensemen. And while
they learn to be the type of "hon-
est" players Berenson wants them
to be each week in practice, the
more advanced skater they come
in, the better.

Chiasson is also one of the
main freshmen that Berenson
consistently trusts on the penalty
kill. And while his coach readily
admits it's a "challenge," it's one
that Chiasson has been happy to
take on.
He's been around the sport
for his entire life. His pedigree is
impeccable - his father isthe late
Steve Chiasson, who was drafted
by the Detroit Red Wings in 1985.
Chiasson will stop at nothing
after working his whole life to get
here. And if Berenson finds some-
thing he can do better, Chiasson's
all ears.
"I've always been just one of
these guys who's trying to get bet-
ter everyday," Chiasson said.
As for his future, Chiasson
can't wait to see where the sport
takes him. In the meantime, he'll
be patient - killing those penal-
ties and setting up tallies.
"(It's) a great journey and I
wouldn't change it," he said.

Feeley, Ryan reach final round at US Grand Prix in Minneapolis

M' swimmers
compete against
Phelps, Lochte at
Grand Prix
By ISABELLA ACHENBACH
For the Daily
The Michigan men's swim-
ming and diving team spent this
past weekend getting pruney in
a pool alongside Michael Phelps,
Ryan Lochte and some of the
top swimmers in the world at
the 2011 US Grand Prix in Min-
neapolis.
"(The US Grand Prix) gives

these guys exposure," said
Michigan coach Mike Bottom.
"They understand what it's like
to swim against the best in the
world."
The Wolverines also swam
in the meet last year. This time,
two Michigan swimmers -
junior Ryan Feeley and sopho-
more Sean Ryan - worked their
way into the finals.
"If one of our guys makes it to
the finals, it's awesome," Bottom
said.
If two guys make it, it's cause
for celebration.
Feeley earned fourth place
overall with a time of 15:36.65 in
the 1,500-meter freestyle. Ryan
came in two spots behind with a

time of 15:45.51 to earn a sixth-
place finish.
"I didn't even know I got
fourth until I got back in Ann
Arbor around 1 a.m.," Feeley
said. "It's pretty nice getting
those times this early in the sea-
son. My teammates are pushing
me everyday in practice."
After finding out his score,
Feeley celebrated by getting
some much-needed sleep.
The Wolverine swimmers
entered this event after topping
Texas and Indiana, their first Big
Ten competitor, last Saturday.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Wolverines pull away from Owls with strong second half

By EMILY O'DONNELL
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team was in for a rude
awakening after the first half of
last night's game against Florida
Atlantic.
The reality FLA. ATLANTIC 49
was that if MICHIGAN 75
the Wol-
verines didn't shape up their
defense and start putting the
ball in the net, they would fall to
the type of team that they need
to beat to have a fighting chance

in the Big Ten.
Though Michigan eventu-
ally overcame Florida Atlantic,
75-49, it had a far from stellar
home-opener. The way the Wol-
verines played in the first half,
it looked as if they were going
to let the game slip away to the
Owls, who had a 2010-11 record
of 7-21.
At the conclusion of the first
half, Michiganwas down, 28-24,
with a field-goal percentage of
38.7 percent. It was 0-for-7 in
three point attempts.
"We were all pretty dis-

traught at halftime," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"We didn't create anything in
the first half. We had a fire-up
talk and made some defensive
adjustments."
That pep talk made all the
difference. The Wolverines
came out of the gate hard and
prepared in the second half. The
team dialed up momentum that
had been missing.
"We knew we would have to
make our layups and turnovers,"
said junior center Rachel Shef-
fer. "We got the lead by picking

up pressure."
Michigan did just that, scor-
ing twice as many points as it
did in the first half, and increas-
ing its field-goal percentage to
54 percent. Turnovers started
working out in the Wolverines'
favor, and Borseth switched to
man-to-man defense, which
significantly lessened the bar-
rage of 3-pointers from Florida
Atlantic.
"We gave them a good look,"
Borseth said. "Everything about
threes is generally about con-
fidence. But if all of a sudden

those threes come disguised in
a different way, you don't feel as
comfortable."
Michigan began pulling away
midway through the second
half.
The confidence started to
build, and the Wolverines
began hitting the mark on most
of their two-point attempts.
Florida Atlantic lost steam, and
with three minutes remaining
in the second half, the Wol-
verines were out of reach with
a 23-point lead. From there,
Michigan was able to breathe
easy, as it remained unbeaten
through two games.
Sheffer was a key offen-
sive player, as she poured in a
career-high of20 points. Buther
consistency lagged with many
missed opportunities.
"Did Rachel have a career

high in points or misses?" Bors-
eth asked. "She could not get
that thing in the basket to save
her soul.
Senior guards Courtney
Boylan and Carmen Reynolds
also contributed nicely. Boylan,
who was named Big Ten Player
of the Week, scored 18 points *
for Michigan, while Reynolds
scored two 3-point baskets in
the early moments of the sec-
ond half for a game total of eight
points.
The Wolverines were able to
walk away unscathed with one
lesson learned: it has a long way
to go to prepare for Big Ten con-
tests.
"They're not a Big Ten team
and that's not what we're used
to," Sheffer said.
Michigan will go up against
Utah at home Thursday at 6p.m.
