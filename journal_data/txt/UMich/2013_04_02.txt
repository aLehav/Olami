FACULTY GOVERNANCE
Provost on
budget: 'U'
- outlook is
optimistic

SACUA rejects
draft statement
on diversity
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
University Provost Phil Han-
Ion spoke before the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs - the University's
leading faculty governance body
- Monday to answer questions
regarding the administration's
budget preparations before the
June meeting of the University's
Board of Regents and the ongo-
ing process of approving the pro-
motion of tenure-track faculty.
Hanlon, who will depart the
University to become president
of Dartmouth College in May,
openedhis comments byexpress-
ing optimism for the future of
the University and its long-term
financial sustainability.
"The last 10 years have been
fabulous for the University of
Michigan," Hanlon said. "In
a very tough environment, we
have continued to succeed and
improve."
Hanlon said his office is pre-

paring to put a budget recom-
mendation before the board in
June. The board will approve
the annual budget, as well as any
commensurate tuition increases,
at that meeting.
Hanlon also spoke on the
ongoing process of approving
promotions of tenure-track fac-
ulty, as faculty promotions must
be approved by both the academ-
ic unit and the administration.
SACUA has previously discussed
this topic with the University
ombuds and others.
"(The) preponderance of them
are fabulous," Hanlon said. "It is
really fun to read them and fig-
ure out what everyone is doing."
He added that the administra-
tion works to discuss decisions
with individual academic units if
there are differing opinions con-
cerning the readiness of faculty
for promotion.

of a statement on diversity that

Vigil expresses
solidarity with

The two-year civil war that
has taken tens of thousands
of lives and forced millions to
become refugees took another
bloody turn when a bomb hit
Damascus University in Syria's
capital.
In solidarity on the Diag

Monday night, signs with mes-
sages such as "Let Ink Flow, Not
Blood" and "Free Syria" were
held by some students, while
others stood in silence holding
candles.
The vigil was part of a wider
effort organized by the Syr-
ian American Council, which is
calling on students across the
nation to hold similar vigils this
week to commemorate students
that were recently killed in the
attack and raise awareness of
the complex issue.
The most recent reports pub-
lished on the group's Facebook
page have confirmed 15 students
were killed and 20 injured, and

reports differ on whether the
attacks came from the Assad
regime or the opposition. On
Jan. 15, Syrian regime forces
dropped bombs on the Univer-
sity of Aleppo, killing 82 people
and injuring192 people.
"People are unsafe in their
homes, in school and at work
because they want the right to
vote and freedom of speech,"
Noor Haydar, a University alum,
said.
Haydar was the main orga-
nizer of Monday's vigil com-
memorating fallen and injured
Syrian students. Rather than
plan smaller, separate vigils of
their own, Oakland University

and University of Michigan-
Flint students took part in the
vigil on the Diag.
UM-Flint graduate student
Abarar Jondy, said she felt an
obligation to make the trip to the
Ann Arbor for the vigil.
"It's about an hour away,
but it's worth it," Jondy said. "I
think the most important thing
to recognize is they're just like
us, trying to have some sort of
normalcy."
Flint senior Heeba Dlewati,
who is from Syria, has person-
al experience with the politi-
cal issues plaguing her home
country.

CITY GOVERNMENT
Council
approves
review of
Dl zoning
Planning commission
to review high-rise
development
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
At their meeting Monday night, the
Ann Arbor City Council addressed Dl
zoning plans, public art and plans for
the site at 413 East Huron Street.
The Dl zoning, the core downtown
zoning area, has been a hot topic at
council because some residents are
opposed to the expansion of high-rise
development in the downtown area.
The Dl zoningresolutionpassed Mon-
day requests that the city's planning
commission review the possibility of
expansion within the area.
However, council members would
still like to bring more specific recom-
mendations to the commission. Spe-
cific requests include an inquiry as to
whether the D1 zoning area is located
on the north side of Huron Street
between Division Street and South
State Street, or on the south side of
William Street between South Main
Street and Fourth Avenue. The dead-
line for the review is Oct. 1.
Councilmember Sabra Briere (D-
Ward 1) argued that the resolution
should be supported because it allows
the commission ample time to com-

Hamas re-elects Mashaal

Longtime leader of
the Islamic militant
group retains power
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The
Islamic militant group Hamas on
Monday re-elected longtime lead-
er Khaled Mashaal, officials said,
choosing a relative pragmatist
who has sparred with movement
hardliners in the past over his
attempt to reconcile with West-
ern-backed Palestinian rivals.
The secretive Hamas did not
issue an announcement, but
Mashaal's re-election was con-
firmed by two Hamas officials.
The vote late Monday capped a
year of internal elections spread
over several countries and
shrouded in mystery.
The Qatar-based Mashaal, 56,
has led Hamas since 1996 and
won another four-year term.
Me ran unopposed and won the
support of a majority in Mamas'
Shura Council which has about
60 members, said the two Hamas
officials who spoke on condition

of anonymity because they were
not permitted to discuss the
secret election with reporters.
Mashaal enjoys the backing of
regional powers Turkey, Egypt
and Qatar, countries where
Hamas' parent movement, the
region-wide Muslim Brother-
hood, is influential.
It's not clear if his re-election
will give him enough clout to
pursue reconciliation or if hard-
liners, particularly those based
in the Gaza Strip, will be able to
veto a deal.
Hamas wrested Gaza from
Mahmoud Abbas, the inter-
nationally backed Palestinian
president, in 2007, leaving him
with only parts of the West Bank.
Since then, the rivals have estab-
lished separate governments
that have become increasingly
entrenched in their respective
territories.
Last year, Mashaal and Abbas,
who have cordial relations,
reachedaedeal whereby Abbas
would head an interim govern-
ment of technocrats in the West
Bank and Gaza. This government

would have paved the way for
general elections.
However, the deal never got
off the ground because of oppo-
sition from Hamas leaders in
Gaza and senior figures in Abbas'
Fatah movement. Hamas leaders
in Gaza were particularly vehe-
ment in their objections, appar-
ently fearing that a unity deal
would give Abbas a new foothold
in Gaza and weaken Hamas' grip
on the territory.
Last week, the emir of Qatar
proposed holding a reconcilia-
tion conference in Egypt in com-
ing weeks to set up a timetable
for forming the interim govern-
ment and holding elections.
Mashaal's re-election could
further distance Hamas from
long-time patron Iran, which has
supplied cash and weapons to
the Hamas government in Gaza.
Hamas broke with another long-
time ally, Syrian President Bashar
Assad, more than ayear ago, over
Assad's brutal crackdown on a
popular revolt that turned into an
armed insurgency.

Law enforcement officials walk out of the home of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland Monday near

November 2011.

ties have not broken off, but

Evidence in police
points to the Aryan
Brotherhood of Texas
KAUFMAN, Texas (AP) -
Two days after a Texas district
attorney and his wife were
found shot to death in their
home, authorities have said little
about their investigation or any
potential suspects.
But suspicion in the slayings
shifted to a white supremacist
gang with a long history of vio-
lence and retribution that was
also the focus of a December law
enforcement bulletin warning
that its members might try to
attack police or prosecutors.
Four top leaders of the Aryan
Brotherhood of Texas were
indicted in October for crimes
ranging from murder to drug
trafficking. Two months later,
authorities issued the bulletin
warning that the gang might try
to retaliate against law enforce-
ment for the investigation that
led to the arrests of 34 of its
members on federal charges.
Kaufman County District
Attorney Mike McLelland and
his wife were found dead Sat-

urday in their East Texas home.
The killings were especially jar-
ring because they happened just
a couple of months after one of
the county's assistant district
attorneys, Mark Hasse, was
killed in a parking lot near his
courthouse office.
McLelland was part of a
multi-agency task force that
took part in the investigation
of the Aryan Brotherhood. The
task force also included the FBI,
the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration as well as police depart-
ments in Houston and Fort
Worth.
Investigators have declined
to say if the group is the focus
of their efforts, but the state
Department of Public Safe-
ty bulletin warned that the
Aryan Brotherhood of Texas is
"involved in issuing orders to
inflict 'mass casualties or death'
to law enforcement officials
involved in the recent case."
Terry Pelz, a former Texas
prison warden and expert on the
Aryan Brotherhood said killing
law enforcement representa-
tives would be uncharacteristic
of the group.
"They don't go around killing

officials," he said. "They don't
draw heat upon themselves."
But Pelz, who worked in@
the Texas prison system for 21
years, added that the gang has a
history of threatening officials
and of killing its own member
or rivals. He suggested if the
Aryan Brotherhood was behind
the slayings in Kaufman County,
some sort of disruption in the
gang's operations might have
prompted their retaliation.
That disruption might have
come last year, when feder-
al prosecutors in Houston in
November announced indict-
ments against 34 alleged mem-
bers of the gang, including four
of its top leaders in Texas. At
the time, prosecutors called the
indictment "a devastating blow
to the leadership" of the gang.
Meanwhile, deputies escorted
some Kaufman County employ-
ees into the courthouse Monday
after the slayings stirred fears
that other public employees
could be targeted. Law enforce-
ment officers were seen patrol-
ling outside the courthouse, one
holding a semi-automatic weap-
on, while others walked around
inside.

U.S. blasts arrest

Egypt satirist
The U.S. State Department
said Monday that arrest warrants
and the investigation of a popular

highlight a "disturbing trend" of
growing restrictions on freedom
of expression in the country.
The strongly worded statement
by U.S. State Department spokes-
woman Victoria Nuland Monday
came a day after Bassem Youssef,
who criticizes President Moham-
med Morsi and hard-line clerics
on his Jon Stewart-style show,
was released on bail following an
interrogation into accusations he
insulted Morsi and Islam.
Youssef is the most prominent
critic of Morsi to be called in for
questioning in recent weeks,
in what the opposition says is a
campaign to intimidate critics
amid wave after wave of politi-
cal unrest in the deeply polar-
ized country. Prosecutors deny
launching a political crackdown,
saying they are only implement-
ing the law.

First international
arms agreement is
heavily supported
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. General Assembly is
expected to vote Tuesday on
what would be the first U.N. trea-
ty regulating the multibillion-
dollar international arms trade
after Iran, North Koreaand Syria
blocked its adoption by consen-
sus.
Assembly spokesman Nikola
Jovanovic told The Associated
Press on Monday that the resolu-
tion to adopt the treaty requires
support from a majority of the
193 U.N. member states. Since the
treaty had strong support when
it was brought before U.N. mem-
bers last Thursday, its approval is
virtually certain - unless there
are attempts to amend it before
the vote.
Many countries, including
the United States, control arms
exports. But there has never been
an international treaty regulat-
ing the estimated $60 billion
global arms trade. For more than
a decade, activists and some gov-
ernments have been pushing for
international rules to try to keep
illicit weapons out of the hands of
terrorists, insurgent fighters and
organized crime.
Hopes of reaching agreement
at a U.N. negotiating conference
were dashed in July when the
U.S. said it needed more time to
consider the proposed accord -
a move quickly backed by Rus-
sia and China. In December, the
U.N. General Assembly decided
to holda final negotiating confer-
ence to agree on a treaty and set
last Thursday as the deadline.
After two weeks of intensive
negotiations, there was grow-
ing optimism as the deadline
approached that all 193 member
states would approve the final
draft treaty by consensus - a
requirement set by the United
States. This time, the U.S. was
prepared to support the final
draft treaty. But Iran, North
Korea and Syria objected.
Iran said the treaty had many
"loopholes," is "hugely suscep-
tible to politicization and dis-
crimination," and ignores the
"legitimate demand" to prohibit
the transfer of arms to those
who commit aggression. Syria
cited seven objections, including
the treaty's failure to include an
embargo on delivering weapons
"to terrorist armed groups and
to non-state actors." And North
Korea said the treaty favors arms
exporters who can restrict arms
to importers that have a right to
legitimate self-defense and the
arms trade.
Both Iran and North Korea are
under U.N. arms embargoes over
their nuclear programs, while
Syria is in the third year of a con-

flict that has escalated to civil
war and is under U.S. and Euro-
pean Union sanctions. Amnesty
International said all three coun-
tries "have abysmal human rights
records - having even used arms
against their own citizens."
The General Assembly had left
open the possibility of a vote on
the treaty if it failed to achieve
consensus.
Jovanovic said the assem-
bly will meet at 10 a.m. EDT on
Tuesday when the first order of
business will be a report from the
chair of the negotiations, Austra-
lian Ambassador Peter Woolcott.
That will be followed bythe vote.
The draft resolution, obtained
by AP, would adopt the Arms
Trade Treaty that was put to
members last Thursday.
If approved, the resolution
asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon, as depositary of the treaty,
to open it for signature by mem-
ber states on June 3. It calls on all
nations to consider signing and
then ratifying the treaty "at the
earliest possible date."
In a letter to the secretary-
general dated Friday, Britain's
U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall
Grant asked the U.N. chief to
circulate the draft resolution to
all U.N. members on behalf of
Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica,
Finland, Japan, Kenya, Mexico,
New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,
the United States and the United
Kingdom.
By the time the draft resolu-
tionwas circulated Mondaytrea-
ty supporters collected a total of
64 cosponsors and they were try-
ing to add more countries before
Tuesday'spot vote.
The draft treaty would not
control the domestic use of
weapons in any country, but it
would require all countries to
establish national regulations
to control the transfer of con-
ventional arms, parts and com-
ponents and to regulate arms
brokers. It would prohibit states
that ratify the treaty from trans-
ferring conventional weapons if
they violate arms embargoes or
if they promote acts of genocide,
crimes against humanity or war
crimes.
The final draft made the
human rights provision even
stronger, adding that the export
of conventional arms should be
prohibited if they could be used
in attacks on civilians or civil-
ian buildings such as schools and
hospitals.
In considering whether to
authorize the export of arms, the
draft says a country must evalu-
ate whether the weapon would
be used to violate international
human rights or humanitar-
ian laws or be used by terrorists
or organized crime. The final
draft would allow countries to
determine whether the weapons
transfer would contribute to or
undermine peace and security.

Conn. reaches deal on tough gun
laws after Newtown shooting

Creates dangerous
offenders list,
state certificate
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)
- Connecticut lawmakers
announced a deal Monday on
what they called some of the
toughest gun laws in the coun-
try that were proposed after
the December mass shooting
in the state, including a ban on
new high-capacity ammuni-
tion magazines like the one in
the massacre that left 20 chil-
dren and six educators dead.
The proposal also called for
background checks for private
gun sales and a new registry
for existing magazines that
carry 10 or more bullets, some-
thing of a compromise for par-
ents of Newtown victims who
had wanted an outright ban
on them, while legislators had
proposed grandfathering them
into the law.
The package also creates
what lawmakers said is the
nation's first statewide danger-
ous weapon offender registry,
immediate universal back-
ground checks for all firearms
sales and expansion of Con-
necticut's assault weapons
ban.
A new state-issued eligibil-
ity certificate would be needed
to purchase any rifle, shotgun
or ammunition under the leg-
islation. To get the certificate,
a buyer would need to be fin-
gerprinted, take a firearms
training course and undergo a

national criminal background
check and involuntary com-
mitment or voluntary admis-
sion check.
The deal is "the most
comprehensive package in
the country because of its
breadth," said Senate Minority
Leader John McKinney, a Fair-
field Republican whose district
includes Newtown.
McKinney said people tend
to focus on assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines,
but he said "there's a lot here
underneath the surface"
addressing mental health and
other issues.
The proposal was revealed
to rank-and-file lawmakers
Monday after weeks of nego-
tiations amonglegislative lead-
ers. A vote was expected later
this week in the Legislature,
where Democrats control both
chambers, making passage all
but assured. The bill would
then be sent to Gov. Dan-
nel P. Malloy, who has helped
lead efforts to strengthen the
state's gun laws.
Both Democratic and
Republican leaders were
expected to support the pro-
posal. Connecticut is sending
a message to Washington and
the rest of the country "this is
the way to get this job done,"
said House Speaker Brendan
Sharkey, a Democrat from
Hamden.
Legislative leaders have
been negotiating since early
March, reviewing recommen-
dations on guns, mental health
care and school security in the

wake of the shooting.
Six relatives of Newtown
victims visited the Capitol
on Monday, asking lawmak-
ers to include a ban on exist-
ing high-capacity magazines.
Some handed out cards with
photographs of their slain
children. They delivered a let-
ter signed by 24 relatives that
demanded that legislators
include existing large-capac-
ity ammunition magazines in
an expected ban on the sale
of magazines that carry 10 or
more bullets.
Allowing such large-capaci-
ty magazines to remain in the
hands of gun owners would
leave a gaping loophole in the
law, said Mark Barden, whose
7-year-old son, Daniel, was
killed in the shooting.
"It doesn't prevent someone
from going out of the state to
purchase them and then bring
them back. There's no way to
track when they were pur-
chased, so they can say, 'I had
this before,"' Barden said. "So
it's a big loophole."
The gunman in the New-
town shooting blasted his way
into Sandy Hook Elementary
School and fired off 154 shots
with a Bushmaster .223-cali-
ber rifle within five minutes.
He went through six 30-round
magazines, though half were
not completely empty, and
police said he had three other
30-round magazines in addi-
tion to one in the rifle. He
gunned down 26 people, then
shot himself to death with a
handgun.

Keep speech free
Colleges shouldn't stifle dialogue - offensive or not
Jn mid-March, University of Central Oklahoma student Olanre-
waju Suleiman claimed she was threatened with expulsion by
her journalism professor, Terry Clark, for her personal blog post,
"An Open Letter to Obnoxious Girls: Stupidity Isn't Cute!" In the post,
which she wrote on Feb. 2, Suleiman criticizes three girls for their
"obnoxious" behavior without specifically naming them. While the
university has declined to speak about the incident, Suleiman claims
that since the blog was used for her journalism class the professor felt
the post was inappropriate and forced Suleiman to apologize to the
class and delete the post or otherwise leave the school. Colleges should
promote free expression and, in the face of a relatively harmless post,
UCO should reconsider its position on the case and re-evaluate how it

n March 25, the U.S.
Supreme Court heard
arguments on California's
Proposition 8
and then the
Defense of Mar-
riage Act two
days later. Also
last Tuesday,
my Facebook
newsfeed turned
into a check- KATIE
erboard of red STEEN
and pink equal
signs. variations
included equal signs with bacon
strips, matzo crackers, Bud Lights
and - oh god, Nicolas Cage's face.
After clicking around for a bit, I
was surprised to see how wide-
spread the equal sign was. I recently
learned that the image is a modified
version of the Human Rights Cam-
paign logo, but I'll be honest and say
that I was oblivious to the origin
of the symbol when I decided to
change my profile picture.
Now, some people who have
changed their profile picture to the
equal sign are getting flack because
of HRC's questionable history with
the transgender community. I didn't
know that at the time - I really
changed my picture mainly because
I noticed that a lot of my gay friends
on Facebook did, and I wanted to
show my support. I mean, my profile
picture at the time was a webcam
pic of me eating pizza. I can afford
to change my picture for the rights
of my friends.
It's definitely "slacktivism," but
who cares? People post the most
mundane shit on Facebook all the
time, so why not spread a message
that contributes something a little
more meaningful than a Buzzfeed
post on corgis?
I'm starting to sound preachy,
which wasn't my intention. If you
didn't change your profile picture to
the equal sign - whatever, it's Face-
book. But the cool thing about the
social media support of LGBT rights
is how visible it became, and how it
created a discussion both online and
off about issues of equality.

I was talking to my friend who
told me that she can't even fathom
how gay marriage is still a debatable
issue. As an article in the Onion put
it, in an ideal world, the Supreme
Court justices would make their
decision on gay marriage in ten
minutes: "Sure, who cares."
But in reality, a lot of people care.
It may be difficult for Ann Arborites
to comprehend the extent of close-
mindedness that plagues much of
our country, but it exists, and it's
still preventing millions of Ameri-
cans from the option of marriage.
Facebook recently posted a neat
little map that shows the density
of equality sign profile pictures by
county. The West and Northeast
are beautifully speckled with deep
reds. The Facebook employee who
posted the map - Eytan Bakshy,
an alum of the University - made
mention of the fact that Washtenaw
County, the University's county, had
the highest percentage of profile
picture changes. So, hey - go us.
But not all of the United States is
so colorful. The South, for the most
part, remains a bleak stretch of pale
pink. Of course, Facebook profile
pictures are not the sole determin-
er of views on LGBT support. Not
everyone who supports gay marriage
uses Facebook, and not everyone
who supports gay marriage and uses
Facebook changed profile pictures.
Still, the map reveals that,
while in places like Ann Arbor gay
rights may be a "well, duh" issue,
not everyone in the country holds
that belief. In a recent CBS poll,
53 percent of Americans believe
that same-sex marriage should be
legal - an improvement from a poll
conducted less than a year ago that
revealed that 51 percent of Ameri-
cans did not believe same-sex mar-
riage should be legal. The United
States, it seems, is progressing.
And yet, according to this poll,
nearly half the country doesn't sup-
port gay marriage. And we should
remember that this is more than
just an issue of matrimony - it's an
issue of basic rights for the LGBT
community. It's about understand-

ing a community on a deeper level
than, "Yeah, sure, I don't care if you
get married." And even if gay mar-
riage is nationally legalized, that
does not mean that people's views
will change, too.
It's clear that the
red equal signs
have already
begun to fade.

As I scroll down the newsfeed, it's
clear that the red equal signs have
already begun to fade. I still have
mine up, but mostly because I pre-
fer it to the pizza picture. But while
our support may continue to dwindle
on newsfeeds across the country,
remember that this is an issue that
remains unresolved. Changing your
profile picture is only a first step, and
while lots of people in Ann Arbor in
particular changed their pictures in
solidarity, that'shardly a reason to sit
back and let the social change begin.
I have no idea what the court will
decide, and I really hope that this
isn't an instance where The Onion
runs a headline that makes more log-
ical sense than headlines from CNN.
You can change the law, but that
doesn't necessarily mean that you'll
change people's minds. We have to
be careful to not depend on a (per-
ceived) natural evolution over time
toward progress and acceptance.
While HRC may not have been the
best group to lead the viral equal-
ity crusade, it's the message behind
changing our profile pictures that
we should focus on. Sm honestly not
sure how long it will be until the vast
majorityofAmericans supportLGBT
rights, but until that day arrives, we
should continue to show solidarity -
even if it is something as simple as a
pink equal sign over a magnified pic-
ture of Nicolas Cage's face.

values free speech.
Suleiman's post doesn't fall in line with the
school's bullying policy, which sanctions stu-
dents for, "bullying ... that threatens the health
or safety of any person." Suleiman describes the
women as "complete idiots" and "dimwitted,
airheaded females." But, by not naming anyone
specifically, Suleiman didn't put them in dan-
ger, regardless if the post is perceived as offen-
sive. On the other hand, the school has had no
response to several tweets from other students
targeting Suleiman. Not only did the University
of Central Oklahoma's journalism department
certainly act beyond their means, but inac-
tion on the other students' tweets also reflects
inconsistencies in the school's policy.
Rather than threatening to expel stu-
dents for expressing themselves, universi-
ties should be advocating their right to do
so. Whether it's a paper deeming Marxism
as egregious or a student's Facebook post
decrying President Barack Obama, colleges
shouldn't attempt to stifle beliefs in personal
or academic forums. A college campus should,

be open to the exchange of viewpoints.
On March 24, UCO's student newspaper, The
Oklahoma Daily, responded to the incident by
calling Suleiman a bully in an editorial. Argu-
ing that Suleiman's post didn't qualify as free
speech because she used the blog in a class-
room setting, the editorial board condemned
her actions reasoning that she "did attempt to
shame her classmates in a public forum" and
that her actions were "intellectual bullying."
The Oklahoma Daily's editorial response is a
clear attack on an individual student and is at
odds with the editorial board's position on free
speech they later made clear on March27 when
the paper criticized a New Mexico school for
over-censoring their student publication.
There is little doubt that bullying online or
in person is a serious issue. However, schools
throughout the country need to recognize when
bullying has occurred and when it's appropri-
ate to act on it. Complaining about girls might
be immature, but the University of Central
Oklahoma administration acted improperly.

We write in response to Amrutha Sivaku-
mar's March 19 article, "The Research Differ-
ence: How the University varies the value of
facultymembers."The reportaddressesthe rel-
ative value of tenure-line and non-tenure-track
faculty at the University, and Sivakumar pres-
ents several keen insights into the work of Uni-
versity lecturers. However, several statements
made by members of the University administra-
tion within the article misrepresent lecturers
in disconcerting ways. Lecturers are excellent
teachers, but many also conduct research, pres-
ent at conferences, publish articles and provide
departmental service. This response speaks to
the myths and realities of teaching off the ten-
ure track at the University and it addresses mis-
representations of lecturers.
Myth One: Lecturers and tenure-track
faculty are inherently different. This is the
fundamental myth in which the other four fol-
lowing myths are rooted, and all the rhetorical
moves administrators make to defend current
inequalities speak to it. For example, Chris-
tina Whitman, vice provost for academic and
faculty affairs, argues that lecturers and ten-
ure-track faculty bring different skills to their
teaching, characterizing lecturers as experts
"in pedagogy" - the science of teaching - and
tenure-track faculty as "people who are bring-
ing their scholarship into the classroom." She
goes on to assert that "professors are con-
stantly expected to think and work outside of
their business hours in ways 'outside-the-box,'"
the false implication being that lecturers do
not normally do these things. Of course we do:
It's our job to think both outside the box and
business hours.
Myth Two: Research necessarily makes for
better teaching. University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald observes that a"'blending together'
of research and teaching defines a professor
at the University." But why should an indi-
vidual's research prowess inherently result in
effective teaching? Max Weber long ago made
the point with characteristic force: "One can
be a prominent scholar and at the same time
be an abominably bad teacher ... " As Weber
explains, "this very art is a personal gift and
by no means coincides with the scientific qual-
ifications of the scholar." Poor teachers are
poor teachers, no matter how impressive their
research credentials.
The evidence summarized in a recent report
funded by the Lecturers' Employee Organiza-
tion suggests that, on average, lecturers may
be somewhat better teachers. Nonetheless,
administrators pay lecturers, on average, half
as much as they pay tenure-track faculty.
Myth Three: Lecturers don't do research;
they just teach. "We are looking for somebody
who is really specializing in pedagogy rather

than people who are bringing their scholar-
ship into the classroom," says Whitman, but
the administration gets much more than that
from its lecturers. Many lecturers conduct
research even though they're not paid or rec-
ognized for their scholarship, and, like tenure-
track faculty, they bring their scholarship into
the classroom. Our report finds that 47 per-
cent of lecturers in Ann Arbor have Ph.D.s, 60
percent do scholarly research in their field and
51 percent publish the results of this research
in academic journals.
Myth Four: Research is the main thing that
enriches teaching. Many lecturers who aren't
engaged in scholarly research and writing bring
other kinds of valuable knowledge beyond
teaching skills to their students. For example,
foreign language lecturers often come from
the countries whose language they teach, and
they bring a rich understanding of the cultural
nuances of those countries to their teaching.
Likewise, many lecturers in schools such as the
School of Education and the School of Social
Work bring "real world" knowledge of and
personal connections with communities and
institutions in which they work. These kinds of
insights can enhance student understanding as
much as a published scholarly article.
Myth five: Lecturers work for the Univer-
sity only temporarily. "When we hire some-
body as a lecturer, we are asking them to teach
well for a defined, limited period," says Whit-
man. Certainly, Whitman's right that tenured
faculty have job security that lecturers lack:
Many administrators limit lecturer contracts
to as little as one term in order to save money.
Yet most University lecturers are hardly tem-
porary. We aren't just passing through the Uni-
versity on our way to some other kind of work.
The average Ann Arbor tenure-track faculty is
49-years-old and has been at the University for
14.6 years; the average lecturer is 47-years-old
and has been at the University for 9.2 years.
Many lecturers spend their entire academic
careers at the University: The faculty survey we
did for our report found that one lecturer had
been teaching here for 45 years, and one-third
of our lecturers hadbeen here for more thanl20.
It's a good thing for students, tenure-track
faculty and the administration that many lec-
turers are committed to the University for the
long haul and able to spend their entire careers
here. What's wrong, however, is that adminis-
trators continue to portray and treat lecturers
as "temps." Instead of propagating myths about
us, they should respect our work and give us the
job security and pay equity we deserve.

" So, what do you guys
think of the equal sign
in people's profile
pictures?"

At first, I
wasn't sure how
to respond to
this question
posed by a fellow
student in the
Shapiro Under-
graduate Library
last week,
shortly after the
U.S. Supreme
Court heard oral

arguments challenging Califor-
nia's Proposition 8 and the federal
Defense of Marriage Act.
On the one hand, the Human
Rights Campaign's red equal sign
popping up all over my newsfeed
had a powerful effect, providing a
clear visual representation of the
large support of same-sex marriage
among Millennials in particular.
Friday, Facebook announced its
finding that "significantly more
(U.S. Facebook) users - roughly 2.7
million (120 percent) more, updat-
ed their profile photo on Tuesday,
March 26," which was the day of
the Prop. 8 oral arguments, "com-
pared to the previous Tuesday."
In fact, during this time period,
Washtenaw County had the largest
increase in profile picture changes
in the country, and many other
counties with college towns were
near the top of the list.
While it's great to see such enthu-
siasm on social media for a cause
that's finally getting the widespread
support it deserves, I couldn't
help but think: Here we go again.
Remember Kony 2012? How about
the Stop Online Piracy Act and PRO-
TECT IP Act blackouts?
It's true that these viral sensa-
tions produced some beneficial
outcomes. Invisible Children's
"Kony 2012" video resulted in the
Senate "condemning" Joseph Kony
and devoting more resources to go

after Kony and his guerrilla group,
the Lord's Resistance Army. These
were all positive developments,
but we still haven't caught Kony.
And how often do we hear about
Kony or other violence these days?
Hardly ever.
Both SOPA and PIPA didn't
become laws, largely due to the
widespread online protests. Howev-
er, the ongoing issue of online piracy
has disappeared from the national
political conversation ever since the
bills died in Congress.
Notice a pattern?
Of course, there are a few differ-
ences with the current viral phe-
nomenon. It's much more difficult
for citizens to influence the actions
of Supreme Court justices than
members of Congress. And while
most Americans didn't know about
Kony, SOPA or PIPA before the wave
of online protests began, the issue of
same-sex marriage is already very
prominent in the national politi-
cal conversation. From President
Barack Obama's declaration last
May to Republican Sen. Rob Port-
man's recent announcement of his
change of heart, same-sex marriage
has received plenty of attention
from politicians and journalists.
However, I have no doubt that
the red equal sign will soon follow
in the footsteps of its viral prede-
cessors. In a few days or weeks,
people will change their profile pic-
tures to other pictures, last week's
Supreme Court cases will fade from
the news cycle and life will largely
return to normal.
However, I'm certainly not
diminishing the significance of
last week's events. The Supreme
Court cases were huge milestones
in the fight for the legalization of
same-sex marriage. But same-sex
marriage supporters have to be
careful not to let this moment of
increased visibility fade away from
Americans' minds.
Americans have a tendency to
fixate on one topic for a short peri-

sex marriage cannot

visibility fade away.

od of time and then move on to the
next topic soon afterwards. Many
Americans are already beginning to
move on from the horrific shootings
at Sandy Hook Elementary School
that occurred in December. Thurs-
day, Obama tried to revive some of
the momentum for new gun-control
legislation that followed the shoot-
ings. "Shame on us if we've forgot-

those kids."

If same-sex marriage support-
ers want to keep the attention of
politicians, the news media and the
American people, they should keep
posting a variety of items on social
media and asking their friends
and followers to share them. They
should hold large rallies in various
parts of the country to attract the
local or national news media. They
should call their lawmakers as often
as they can to get them to support
same-sex marriage and fight for this
cause. This latter strategy is becom-
ing easier to do every day. "As far as
I can tell, political leaders are falling
all over themselves to endorse your
side of the case," Chief Justice John
Roberts remarked to the lawyers
challenging the same-sex marriage
bans last week.
It's great that people are express-
ing their support for same-sex mar-
riage during this historic time. But
changing a Facebook picture is only
the first step toward achieving last-
ing social change.

the diversity statement would be a

SACUA members did not
approve the drafted diversity
statement, and the body sent the
draft back to the Committee on
University Values and the Com-
mittee for an Inclusive Univer-
sity.
The draft stressed the need for
diversity at the University and
called for the administration to
dedicate significant resources
and measures to improve diver-
sity.

"The proposed resolution
simply provides additional guid-
ance to the planning commission
and sets a clear deadline," Briere
said. "I believe the scope of work
is accomplishable in six months
and should be something Council
members can support."
Councilmember Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) said he was concerned
that the public would not be able
to comment on the issue as it went
to the planning commission, but
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said the residents will be able to
write in and give feedback at more
informal meetings.
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) said he was
worried about what Hieftje called
a "concrete deadline." Both he and
the mayor said they want to make
sure the review would return to
City Council by the deadline.

tions are not where they should
be; we are really happy that about
40 percent (of optiMize partici-
pants) are women."
optiMize aims to "connect stu-
dents who want to do things with
people who know how," Sorensen
explained.
Business sophomore Sripriya
Navalpakam, who founded a
micro-financing start-up, turned
to optiMize with a business pitch
and an aspiration to expand it into
the greater community.
"One thing that they've created
right now is a community of excit-
ed students who are really pas-
sionate about creating change,"
Navalpakam said. "We weren't
really a part of this before we
joined optiMize."
Navalpakam explained that
working with low-income com-
munity members on her venture
has led to a number of typical
challenges. While accepting that

social entrepreneurship entailed
a fair degree of stress, she said
optiMize has connected her with
lasting mentors.

While many SACUA members
said they agreed with the senti-
ment of the measure, they had
disagreements over the language
used and initiatives it proposed.
Engineering Prof. Rachel Gold-
man said the statement should
take into account the diversity
initiatives that are already ongo-
ing at the University, as well as
make suggestions on how the fac-
ulty can contribute to making a
more diverse community.
"We can come at this with
supporting what the University
is already doing," Goldman said.
"Anything we suggestbeyond that
should be in that same flavor."
Physics Prof. Finn Larsen said
the committees should also work

on an addendum that encourages
supporting students from dif-
ferent socioeconomic and racial
backgrounds. Other members
of SACUA agreed with his com-
ments and discussed options to
support students from disparate
backgrounds.
Engineering Prof. Kimberlee
Kearfott, the chair of SACUA,
added that the main purpose of
the statement should be about
providing a diverse community
where student could learn from
the differences they have from
other students.
After a redraft of the statement
that will factor in the comments
from SACUA members, the state-
ment will again be considered.

CARTS

"is a good incubator" for entre-
preneurs seeking to enter the
food industry without the risk of
opening a permanent restaurant.
Former Mark's Carts contribu-
tors Eat and The Lunchroom
have since evolved from cart to
full restaurant.
Mark's Carts also provides
an opportunity for restaurants
to broaden their customer base
beyond the confines of their
restaurant locations. Though
Hut-K and Satchel's BBQ have
permanent locations a few
miles from downtown, the food
cart atmosphere allows them to
attract new customers who may
return to the full location in the
future.
"Washington Street was really
kind of quiet," Hosed said. "But
when the carts came, it activated
the street and started to build
community. People would just
come by to visit and participate
in the social aspect of it."

Mark's Cart's will also be a
part of the FestiFools activities
on Sunday. Festifools is a giant
puppet parade put on by the
University's Lloyd Hall Scholars
Program.
Ji Hye Kim, a chef and man-
ager at San Street, has partici-
pated in Mark's Carts since its
inception three years ago. She
said vendors will be creating
special dishes and decorat-
ing their carts for FoolMoon, a
night festival before Festifools
on Friday.
"We're putting up lights and
handmade signs and trying to
have more fun than we normally
do, whichis abiggoalbecause we
do have a lot of fun anyway."
LSA senior Alex Perlman,
co-owner of The Beet Box, said
FestiFools complements the
environment of Mark's Carts,
and was optimistic about his
business during this year's sea-
son.
"We feel that we are intimate-
ly connected with the FestiFools
parade, and we're just one stop
throughout the whole event, so

we're trying to emulate the same
energy they have going on in
their festivities," Perlman said.
Hosed said events allow the
carts to interact with the com-
munity while the sponsors ben-
efit from the "built-in audience."
"We are definitely feeding off
the community, and the com-
munity is feeding off us," Hosed
said.
Kim said she hopes to grow
herbusiness withinthe nextyear
into a "full-service, casual Asian
Eatery," just as Eat and The
Lunchroom have grown beyond
their carts.
"I see Mark's Carts as a com-
munity of entrepreneurs and a
hotbed for venturing out to strike
on your own forbigger and better
things," Kim said.
Kim added that guests view
Mark's Carts as a cohesive com-
munity ratherthan eight individ-
ual businesses competing with
each other. The carts have a sym-
biotic relationship and engage in
"friendly competition."

Help shrinks as poverty spikes
in the across the United States

Charities
dwindling in
number nationwide
BALTIMORE (AP) - Anto-
nio Hammond is the $18,000
man.
He's a success story for
Catholic Charities of Balti-
more, one of a multitude of
organizations trying to haul
people out of poverty in this
Maryland port city where one
of four residents is considered
poor by U.S. government stan-
dards.
Hammond says he ended up
in Baltimore three years ago,
addicted to crack cocaine and
snorting heroin, living in aban-
doned buildings where "the
rats were fierce," and financing
his addiction by breaking into
cars and stealing copper pipes
out of crumbing structures.
Eighteen months after find-
ing his way to Catholic Chari-
ties via a rehabilitation center,
the 49-year-old Philadelphia
native is back in the work
force, clean of drugs, earning
$13 an hour cleaning laborato-
ries for the Biotech Institute of
Maryland and payingtaxes.
Catholic Charities, which
runs a number of feder-
ally funded programs, spent
$18,000 from privately donat-
ed funds to turn around

Hammond's life through the
organization's Christopher's
Place program which provides
housing and support services to
recovering addicts and former
prisoners.
Such success stories are in
danger as $85 billion in fed-
eral government spending cuts
begin squeezing services for
the poor nationwide. The cuts
started kicking in automati-
cally on March 1 after feuding
Democrats and Republicans
failed to agree on a better plan
for addressingthe national def-
icit. They are hitting at a time.
of spiking poverty as the U.S.
slowly climbs out of the deep-
est economic downturn since
the Great Depression of the
1930s.
"All I wanted to do was get
high," Hammond said. "I didn't
even know any more how to eat
or clean myself"
Now he lives with two other
men in housing subsidized by,
the charity, got his driver's
license and bought a car. What
he marvels at the most is that
he has been accepted after a
20-year absence by some of his
nine children. That's the best
part, he said. "At least I know
now they might not hate me."
The U.S. Census Bureau
puts the number of Ameri-
cans in poverty at levels not
seen since the mid-1960s
when President Lyndon B.
Johnson launched the fed-

eral government's so-called
War on Poverty. As President
Barack Obama began his sec-
ond term in January, nearly
50 million Americans - one
in six - were living below the
income line that defines pov-
erty, according to the bureau.
A family of four that earns less
than $23,021 a year is listed as
living in poverty. The bureau
said 20 percent of the country's
children are poor.
Although it is far from the
country's poorest city, Balti-
more's poverty rate far outstrips
the national average of one in
six.
Catholic Charities of Balti-
more is a conduit for state and
federal money for programs
designed to help the poor. The
charity plays a major role in
administering Head Start, a
federal program that provides
educational services for low-
income pre-school children
and frees single mothers to find
work without the huge expense
of childcare.
The spending cuts, known as
the sequester, are going to hit
Head Start especially hard.
"Before the sequester only
half of the need was being met.
Now, after the cuts fully take
effect, there will be 900 chil-
dren already in the program
who won't be able to take part,"
said William McCarthy, execu-
tive director of Catholic Chari-
ties.

Afghan teenager fatally stabs U.S.
soldier playing with children

U.S. death toll rises
due to fighting in
warmer weather
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- An Afghan teenager fatally
stabbed an American soldier in
the neck as he played with chil-
dren in eastern Afghanistan,
officials said Monday, as the U.S.
death toll rose sharply last month
with an uptick in fighting due to
warmer weather.
Last week's calculated attack
shows that international troops
still face a myriad of dangers
even though they are increas-
ingly taking a back seat in opera-
tions with Afghan forces ahead
r of a full withdrawal by the end
of 2014.
Just one U.S. service mem-
ber was killed in February - a
five-year monthly low - but the
American death toll climbed to at
least 14 last month.

Overall, the number of Ameri-
cans and other foreign forces
killed in Afghanistan has fallen
as their role shifts more toward
trainingand advisinggovernment
troops instead of fighting.
But a series of so-called insid-
er attacks on foreign troops by
Afghan forces of insurgents dis-
guised as them has threatened
to undermine the trust needed
to help President Hamid Kar-
zai's government take the lead in
securing the country after more
than 11 years at war.
The attack that killed Sgt.
Michael Cable, 26, of Philpot, Ky.,
last Wednesday occurred after
the soldiers had secured an area
for a meeting of U.S. and Afghan
officials in a province near the
volatile border with Pakistan.
But one of two senior U.S. offi-
cials who confirmed that Cable
had been stabbed by a young
man said the assailant was not
believed to have been in uniform
so it was not being classified as an

insider attack.
The officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
the investigation is ongoing, said
the attacker was thought to be
about 16 years old. He escaped so
his age couldn't be verified.
Cable's brother Raymond
Johnston, a 42-year-old waiter
in Owensboro, Ky., said the Army
told the family the basics of what
happened and that his brother
was stabbed in the neck from
behind.
Johnston said his brother, who
also did a tour of dutyin Iraq, was
"prepared before he left for any-
thing that happened" in Afghani-
stan.
Cable met individually with
Johnston and three other fam-
ily members before leaving for
Afghanistan and had similar con-
versations with each - that the
deployment was extremely haz-
ardous and that his family and
friends should "continue to enjoy
life" if he was killed.

Company vows
to increase
communication
with consumers
BEIJING (AP) - Apple
apologized to Chinese consum-
ers after government media
attacked its repair policies for
two weeks in a campaign that
reeked of economic nationalism.
A statement Apple posted in
Chinese on its website Mon-
day said the complaints had
prompted "deep reflection"
and persuaded the company of
the need to revamp its repair
policies, boost communication
with Chinese consumers and
strengthen oversight of autho-
rized resellers.
State broadcaster CCTV and
the ruling Communist Party's
flagship newspaper, People's
Daily, had led the charge
against the American compa-
ny. They accused Apple Inc. of
arrogance, greed and "throw-
ing its weight around" and
portrayed it as just the latest
Western company to exploit
the Chinese consumer.
The attacks quickly back-
fired, though, and were mocked
by the increasingly sophisti-
cated Chinese consumers who
revere Apple and its products.
State-run media also inadver-
tently revived complaints over
shoddy service by Chinese
companies.
Nonetheless, Apple respond-

ed with an apology from CEO
Tim Cook.
"We've come to understand
through this process that
because of our poor communi-
cation, some have come to feel
that Apple's attitude is arro-
gant and that we don't care
about or value feedback from
the consumer," Cook's Chinese
statement said, as translated
by The Associated Press. "For
the concerns and misunder-
standings passed on to the con-
sumer, we express our sincere
apologies."
Although Apple enjoys
strong support from Chinese
consumers, the vehemence
of the attacks and the impor-
tance of the Chinese market
appeared to have persuaded
the company to appear con-
trite.
The People's Daily news-
paper ran an editorial last
Wednesday headlined "Strike
down Apple's incomparable
arrogance."
"Here we have the Western
person's sense of superiority
making mischief," the news-
paper wrote. "If there's no
risk in offending the Chinese
consumer, and it also makes
for lower overheads, then why
not?"
Chinese observers accused
People's Daily of gross hypoc-
risy and pointed out that the
newspaper had maintained a
stony silence when Chinese
companies were implicated
over food safety, pollution and
other scandals. Meanwhile,

CCTV was shamed when it
emerged that celebrities had
been recruited to blast Apple
on Weibo, China's version of
Twitter, in what had been
billed as a grassroots cam-
paign.
"The public responded in
two ways to this incident,"
popular commentator Shi
Shusi wrote on his Weibo
account. "One group supports
this criticism but quite a num-
ber of people felt that there are
state monopolies which have
severely violated customer's
rights, but which are not being
exposed."
Popular business magazine
Caijing said its readers iden-
tified a long list of abusers,
including state banks that lend
to those with political connec-
tions while stiffing ordinary
savers with low rates on depos-
its; a government oil company
that sets gas prices and other
rates as it sees fit; and state
telecom providers notorious
for their lack of customer ser-
vice.
"If media is going to go after
Apple, let's hope they spare
some thought for those big
Chinese communications com-
panies and other monopolies,
the ones that enrich special
interests in the name of being
publicly owned," Cai Tongqi,
a lawyer from the eastern
province of Jiangsu, wrote on
Weibo.
Consumers seem unfazed
by the state media's attacks on
Apple.

Interscope and NKOTB parted

tively hopeless for acquiring
reputable writers and produc-

the executive producers of the
album).
Its 2008 comeback, The Block,

14-year hiatus between studio

THE BLOCK

Is it still a boy band if they all own minivans?

ics are as basic as can be. Each
track is a hollow-shell version of
the typical boy band music of the
early 1990s - as if each track is a
cheap variation on "Don't Want
You Back" and "It's Gotta Be
You" by the Backstreet Boys. We
get it. She's either bad for you, or
you just can't live without her.
The track titles are as uninter-
esting as the corresponding lyrics
(bonus points for coherency, at
least). Nearly every track is based
from some common song phrase
(e.g. "Take My Breath Away," "We
Own Tonight," "Now or Never")
and, once again, hosts generic
phrases. "I wouldn't have noth-
ing without you / girl you are my
world / cause baby you know I
love you." Not exactly breathtak-
ing lyrics from "Take My Breath
Away." Maybe you just had to be
there.
Even the title is low-effort.
Naming act album after the
number of albums an artist has
released is overdone and tacky,
not to mention that in this case,

it's not entirelytruthful. NKOTB
has released six studio albums,
so this "10" comes from includ-
ing the release of Christmas
albums, compilation albums and
albums released with the Back-
street Boys. Evidently it wanted
to sport a number worthy of
almost 30 years in the industry.
Frankly, NKOTB is not a
group that's meant to perse-
vere in the music industry. An
assemblage of 40-year-olds
hardly constitutes a "boy" band,
let alone the New "Kids" on the
Block. Same goes for you, Back-
street "Boys." It's a wonder that
this album even exists, given the
minimal effort thrown into it.
Donnie Wahlberg could learn
quite a bit from his brother,
Mark, about moving on from a
juvenile music career.
This album will appear on
the setlist of the just-announced
"Package Tour," featuring Boys
II Men and 98 Degrees. It's the
complete "package" of boy band
has-beens.

For a band so creative and so suc-

this change in tactics might be
a bad choice. The consequences
are apparent in their new release,
Dear MissLonelyhearts.
The first two albums released

Soaring above the noise are lead

Cold War Kids' last album,
Mine Is Yours, comes from a part-

King and marks the band's first
attempt to mold its ideas to the
influence and direction of a pro-
ducer. The changes that surfaced

The signs are
on the wallfor a
Bieber demise

We hope that's a gord. ODD FUTURE
Lone'Wolf' Tyler back
with less offensive album

Rapper grows up
with emotional,
narrative lyrics
By ANDREW ECKHOUS
DailyArts Writer
He's the man who earned
fame for chewing up a cock-
roach, shouting homophobic
slurs and gen-
erally just stir- B+
ring shit up.
But Tyler, the Wolf
Creator was
only 20 years Tyler the
old when he Creator
catapulted Odd Future
to stardom,
and his public
profile and immediate popu-
larity put him squarely in the
spotlight. Unsurprisingly, crit-
ics and advocacy groups alike
derided Tyler as a homophobe,
misogynist and proponent of
rape.
Tyler is an odd bird, though.
While he tosses gay slurs
around pretty regularly, he
was extremely supportive of
Frank Ocean when he came out

as bisexual, and the DJ in Odd
Future, Syd tha Kyd, is a lesbian.
People know him as an anger-
filled rapper, but he also spends
much of his time addressing his
loneliness and vulnerability in
his raps. He's a man of contra-
dictions, and this depth of per-
sonality is on full blast on Wolf;
his newest release.
Last year, in an interview
with "Spin," Tyler expressed
the urge to grow up a little bit:
"Talking about rape and cutting
bodies up, it just doesn't interest
me anymore. ... What interests
me is making weird hippie music
for people to get high to." Did he
achieve this goal, though? Not
quite.
Tyler goes 30 seconds without
offending anyone on the album's
first song, but, in quintessen-
tial Tyler, the Creator style, the
first two words he utters are
"fuck you." Admittedly, 'Tyler
spends much less time describ-
ing his perverse fantasies this'
time around, but not too much
else has changed. If you were
offended by him before, you'll
likely still be offended, just this
time you might only dry heave,
not puke.

Surely there are people who
only like Tyler for his NC-17
lyrics, but others appreciate
the candidness with which he
raps. He's never been shy about
his lack of a father, emotional
issues and what seems to be at
least a mild case of depression.
His rap is his therapy, which
becomes even clearer consid-
ering that he plays a therapist
character on quite a few of his
songs on Wolf
"Pigs" encapsulates this side
of Tyler. Half-misplaced anger
and half-unresolved emotional
issues, the song mixes a narra-
tive about a bullied boy getting
violent revenge with candidly
depressing lines ("I got 99 prob-
lems, and all of them's being
happy"). The boy in the song,
Wolf, is the main character
throughout the album and may
as well be named Tyler. He has
no father, few friends and a
twisted sense of what life is like.
Wolf also gives listeners
insight into Tyler's new life
as a celebrity. On "Colossus,"
which is essentially his version
of Eminem's "Stan," Tyler tells
the story of his meeting with an
obsessive fan. Like Tyler, the kid

gets bullied and has emotional
problems, but adores Tyler to the
point of infatuation and worship.
The song will sadden you, but it
illustrates what Tyler has come
to represent for some people.
He seems reluctant to accept his
crown as king of the freaks and
just wants a little bit of privacy.
Tyler produced the entirety
of Wolf, and it contains a fairly
consistent tone throughout.
His attempts to mix his influ-
ences and create something
new gives birth to a uniquely
unhinged sound, something that
can only be described as a vision
quest through Tyler's dement-
ed psyche. "Jamba" sounds
like N.E.R.D meets New York
boom bap, and slower songs like
"Answer" and "Slater" showcase
Tyler's love for jazz and jazz-
fusion. And one can never ignore
the influence of angry rappers
like Eminem and D12, as Tyler
does his version of their abrasive
beats and lyrics periodically.
Wolf won't convert anyone
who is easily offended, but Tyler
has grown a lot from his last
album, and it looks like he might
be more than just a flavor-of-
the-month fad.

A longtime book lover takes an
up-close look at e-readers

By MAX RADWIN
Daily Arts Writer
I consider myself an avid
reader, if not a shamefully pre-
tentious one. I'm very choosy
about which authors I read in
my down time and which books
by those authors I ultimately
end up committing to. This also
means that the mode by which
I choose to read the stories I do
is, in a sense, as important as the
stories themselves, which is why
I was so shocked to have recent-
ly found myself reading from a
Nook, Barnes & Noble's e-reader
tablet. As a traditionalist of sorts
- if reading books can even war-
rant such a title - the thought of
sitting down without the physi-
cal pages, but instead a piece of
hardware, always seemed like a
distant impossibility. But at least
now my dislike for e-readers is
justifiable. I can fairly say: "Yes,
I tried it, and I don't like it."
I didn't go out and buy an
e-reader - I wasn't that curi-
ous. My mother bought a new
computer, and I guess Barnes
& Noble was trying to dump off
some of the soon-to-be-obsolete
models on people naive enough
to invest in an HP laptop, so it
was just lying around the house.
It was break, I needed to read a

really did need) and I didn't have ably. I was a more comfortable -

lent to that of 100 books. But if
you use a Nook, Kindle or iPad for
an extended length of time as is
intended, they easily become the
cleaner option. The conversation
almost becomes moot; there are
other, more impactful pieces of
technology whose environmental
impact is more relevant and press-
ing to its expansion and develop-
ment - tablets might not be one
of them.
I don't know whether e-readers
are a fad or the way of the future.
There's talk that Amazon wants
to put, somehow, the Kindle in
your car; Barnes & Noble Inc.
has landed new content-licensing
partnership deals with Viacom
and Paramount, among others, in
an attempt to expand their Nook
Video library. But these devel-
opments point less toward an
enhanced reading experience and
more toward a consolidated tech-
nology, something that functions
more like a computer or a smart-
phone than as a true e-reader.
Even if e-readers remain
prominent as their own entity,
and continue to get more glam-
orous, user-friendly and porta-
ble, I don't see the physical book
ever falling into total obsoles-
cence. My books may get dusty
over time, but they'll never go
out of style.

Old friends, new stage

'M' searching for wins

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
When Michigan coach John
Beilein was in the early stages
of his coaching saga, there was a
man who would occasionally sit
in the stands and watch. Nothing
unusual about that.
The unusual part was that this
man had a coaching pedigree
that far exceeded the man he was
watching, a pedigree that even-
tually landed him into the Bas-
ketball Hall of Fame in 2005.
Back in the early 1990s, Beilein
was coaching Canisius College,
a small Division I school in Buf-
falo, N.Y. The gyms would be tiny
and cramped - nothing like the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta, where
Beilein's current team will play
in the Final Four this weekend.
On Saturday, the Wolverines
will play Syracuse in the Final
Four. Jim Boeheim, the coach
of the Orange and the man that
used to sit in the stands and
watch Beilein at Canisius, will be
the man on the opposite bench.
"I've always admired his
coaching at every level, watch-
ing his teams play," Boeheim said
in a teleconference on Monday.
"We've never even gone out to
dinner, but I just have tremen-
dous respect and admiration for
how he coaches."
Before Canisius - Beilein's
first Division I job - he had
slogged his way through the
lower rungs of the coaching
world, from high school to com-
munity college to Division II.
Canisius was the stepping stone,
leadinghim to Richmond, W. Va.,
and eventually Michigan. With-
out Boeheim, there's a very good
chance Beilein wouldn't have
gotten that job.
"I was a borderline candidate,"

Michigan coach John Belein has been a coach at the collegiate level for35 years. Saturday will be his first Final Four appearance.

Bowling Green (2-4, 6-16) will
start freshman left-hander Brett
Fitzwater on the mound against
Michigan's senior right-hander
Ben Ballantine.
The Wolverines' offense will
be licking their chops at the
chance to hit against the strug-
gling freshman. Fitzwater is
posting an 8.31 ERA in two starts
and three appearances this sea-

Statistically, Ballantine is

close has been Ballantine's spe-
cialty, despite his inability to last
more than just a few innings into
his recent starts.
Ballantine has walked just

eight batters this season, a
team best for pitchers who have
thrown at least 20 innings. In
the games he's started, Michigan
has never trailed by more than
one run while he's on the mound.
"He grinds, and he battles,"
said Michigan coach Erik
Bakich. "He's one of the guys
we're going to count on if we're
going to have success. If we need
a right-handed starter, he's cer-
tainly the guy we're gonnago to."
Ballantine should be due for
increased success against a dis-
mal Falcons lineup that consists
of only one player with a batting
average above .300. As a team,
Bowling Green has scored just
89 runs in its 22 games this year.
Luckily for Michigan's
Wednesday starter, who has yet
to be named, Central Michigan's
lineup doesn't have very much
to boast about offensively. The
Chippewas have only one more
player hitting above .300 than
the Falcons do, but they have a
dynamic duo at the top of their
lineup and hit for power with a
team total of 12 home runs on the
year.
Bakich will most likely give
the nod to a left-hander, attempt-
ing to thwart Central Michigan's
speed on the base paths. The
runners the Wolverines would
like to keep off base are also the
Chippewas' two best hitters. The
Regnier brothers, Logan and
Nick, have combined for 24 sto-
len bases in 27 attempts.
Minimizing the damage done
by the Regnier brothers will be
one of Michigan's recipes for
success, along with finding its
offensive groove for the first
time in weeks. Two wins in the
middle of the week might just be
the confidence boost this team
needs as it gets into the heat of
Big Ten play.

Beilein said. "He really got me on
the board. Ended up getting the
job. That was 20 years ago. So I
owe him a lot, and admire him a
lot, as well."
It didn't stop there, either.
Beilein's first job at a major pro-
gram was at West Virginia in
2002, and again, there was some
help from a coaching friend of
his, the man that used to sit in
those rickety bleachers,
"Especially when the West
Virginia athletic director called
me, I told him to hang up the
phone and call John Beilein back
and hire him without waiting
another minute because he's a
great coach and he's won every
place he's been," Boeheim said.
"He's just a tremendous guy and
a great basketball coach."
Beilein will be tasked with
trying to crack Boeheim's famed
2-3 zone, while Boeheim will be

trying to stop a Michigan offense
that he described as "probably
the best offensive team in the
country," and one that will be "by
far the biggest challenge of the
year."
In a tournament that show-
cases quick turnarounds against
completely unfamiliar oppo-
nents, both coaches will have a
whole week to prepare for one
another this time around. That
could benefit Beilein, who in nine
attempts has never won a game
against Boeheim. Still, Boeheim
won't be overlooking Beilein
on Saturday, especially because
Beilein has never had a team
quite as talented as this one.
"He's been successful wher-
ever he's been," Boeheim said. "I
remember him at Erie, Le Moyne,
Canisius, Richmond, you name it.
West Virginia. He's won every
place he's been. That's difficult to

do, to be able to go to five or six
different places and win.
"John has been able to win at
every place along the line, and
nothing different now."
Without Canisius, and without
West Virginia, who knows where
Beilein would've ended up.
Maybe not at Michigan. With-
out Boeheim, maybe every part
of Beilein's trajectory stays the
same, and the two would still be
coaching against each other on
Saturday in the Final Four.
Then again, probably not. For
Beilein to be here now, in his first
Final Four, he needed those rec-
ommendations. One doesn't hap-
pen without the other.
It's fitting that in a season
rumored to be Boeheim's last, the
man who could potentially end
his run at a title is a man who he
helped put into that position, way
back at a small school in Buffalo.

Anderson gets win No. 300

By LEV FACHER
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan water polo
team's drubbing of Grove City on
March 17 wasn't all that unique,
save for a lopsided 13-0 final
score.
At least, nobody realized it
was. As it turned out, the vic-
tory marked No. 300 of Michigan
coach Matt Anderson's career in
Ann Arbor - he now accounts for
more than 88 percent of the wins
in the program's 13-year history.
Anderson and his team,
though, weren't making a big deal
about the accomplishment.
"I had no idea (about the mile-
stone) until I read it," Anderson
said. "I'm not even sure if my wife
knows."
He had already joined an elite
class of Michigan coaches, as he is
one of only five to lead a women's
program to 200 wins during his
career.
"Honestly, it's a great accom-
plishment," Anderson said.
"Mainly because it shows that
the program has been very con-
sistent."
In this case, consistency has
translated to Michigan becoming
the winningest program in wom-
en's college water polo since 2001,
the year that the NCAA began
sponsoring a championship.
Anderson sits third on the list
of all-time coaching wins in the
sport and has led the team to
the College Water Polo Associa-
tion Eastern Championship four
times - in 2005 and a three-year
stretch from 2008-10.
The team has found success
outside the swimming pool as
well. Four of Anderson's play-
ers have made the All-Academic
team in both the CWPA and
Association of Collegiate Water
Polo Coaches Polls in all four of
their years at Michigan. In the
program's history, 113 All-Aca-
demic honors have been awarded
to Wolverine players on behalf of
the CWPA and ACWPC.
Anderson deflected credit for
the program's success to the mul-
titude of high-caliber players to
come through Ann Arbor in years
past. True to form, the Michigan
coach vastly understated the suc-
cess his players have experienced
since he took over the program
before the 2003 season.

Michigan coach Matt Anderson has brought Michigan to the national stage.

Betsey Armstrong has won seven
medals with the U.S. national
team, including a gold at the 2012
London Summer Olympics and
silver at the 2008 Beijing Games.
She isn't done contributing to
the Wolverine program, either.
She currently works as an assis-
tant coach for Michigan, and
her presence seems to be paying
off - in Saturday's rivalry clash
against Indiana, senior goalie
Alex Adamson set her career high
in saves with 17, including three
in overtime to preserve a narrow
Michigan lead.
"It says a lot that (she) came
back after playing for Matt," said
junior driver Sophie Hoegh.
In addition, the Wolverines
have seen 24 AWPCA All-Amer-
icans dominate the center pool at
Canham Natatorium, including
senior attacker Kiki Golden, who
took home an honorable mention
in 2011.
Senior attacker Natalie Naruns
pointed to the Eastern Division
Championship as the Wolverines'
constant preseason objective.
Michigan hasn't achieved this
goal every year, but when it miss-
es it's usually by the narrowest of
margins. The Wolverines have
reached the Eastern Champion-
ship title game every year except

for two while under Anderson,
coming away with five trophies.
The 2013 campaign has had its
share of struggles - Michigan's
record, which currently stands at
14-10, is on pace to seta program-
worst winning percentage. The
current low came in 2007, when
the Wolverines went 24-16 and
failed to reach the Eastern Divi-
sion final.
But Anderson seems to have
orchestrated a total about-face
from his team, which is currently
riding a 10-game winning streak
after starting the season 1-7.
"There's a perception that you
have to be in California to be suc-
cessful in water polo," Naruns
said. "Matt's philosophy from the
get go has always been to encour-
age demand and self-discipline,
which has ensured the success of
this program."
Anderson is currently the face
of Michigan water polo, a fact
that isn't likely to change anytime
soon. For now, he has Michigan as
focused as ever heading into post-
season play in search of an NCAA
Tournament bid. The national
championships are yet to come,
but there's no doubt that Ander-
son and the Wolverines have an
excellent foundation for Wolver-
ine teams yet to come.
