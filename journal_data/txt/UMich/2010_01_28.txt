University in
process to be
reaccredited

Every ten years
University evaluated
on its educational
experience
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
The University is in the midst
of the process of being reaccred-
ited by the Higher Learning Com-
mission - a non-governmental
agency that ensures that colleges
and universities throughout the
Midwest meet certain standards
and are nf the highest quality.
The process of reaccredita-
tion, which takes place every ten
years, consists of two parts: an
internal report by the University
and a campus visit by a thirteen-
person team of experts from the
HLC, which will occur from
March 15-17. Universities must
be accredited in order to receive
financial aid money from the fed-
eral government.
Each institution's self-report
contains five criteria mandated by
the HLC each focused on differ-
ent aspects of the University. The
five areas of analysis are the Uni-
versity's mission, its preparedness

for the future, the in-classroom
experience, out-of-classroom
engagement and application of
knowledge.
In addition, the University also
got the opportunity to pick one
topic for special emphasis study.
For this portion of the assessment,
the University has chosen to focus
on internationalization.
In an interview with the Daily
earlier this week, University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman said she
was looking forward to the HLC's
visit.
"It's a lot of work, but I think
that at the end of the day we'll find
same things that as a result, we
can do better that are. gaad," Gale-
man said. "So I look forward to it.
I think we've got a good story to
tell. I feel really good about it."
While the reaccreditation
occurs only once every ten years,
the University has been preparing
for the past three years. In 2007,
University Provost Teresa Sulli-
van appointed Geology Prof. Ben
van der Pluijm to head the Univer-
sity's self study.
Though there is little doubt that
the University will be reaccred-
ited, Sullivan said in an interview
on Monday that the process needs
to be taken seriously as an oppor-

begun, about 15 people gathered
on the Diag, forming a circle to sing
and offer a prayer for the people
of Haiti and those affected by the

Announcement is
expected to come in
the next couple days
By RYAN KARTJE
Managing.Sports Editor
It has been nine years since the
Michigan hockey team met their
counterparts in East Lansing in the
"Cold War," pinning both teams
outdoors, under the lights of Spar-
tan Stadium.
But the long-awaited "Cold War
II" matchup, this time at Michi-

gan Stadium, is expected to be
officially announced "in the com-
ing days," according to an Athletic
Department official, who wished
to remain anonymous because an
official announcement has yet to be
made.
With the two teams scheduled to
meet next season on Dec.10 and 11,
the outdoor game is widely believed
to take place on Dec.11t.
Athletic Department spokesman
Bruce Madej declined to confirm
the announcement.
"Details still need to be worked
out before any official announce-
ment can be made," Madej said

last night.
When the two teams faced off in
2001, a crowd of 74,554 --the world
record for a hockey game - gath-
ered for the game. Michigan State,
the top-ranked team in the nation
at the time, was trailing with 47
seconds remaining, when Spartan
Jim Slater scored to end the game
in a 3-3 tie.
The initial "Cold War" set off
a chain of outdoor hockey events
throughout college and profession-
al hockey, leading to high demand
for a rematch of the intrastate
rivals, who still hold the attendance

Undergraduates
take lessons from
classes and apply
them to real world
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily Staff Reporter
Being a full-time student is a
time-consuming commitment for
most. But for some University stu-
dents, one job just isn't enough.
Translating what they've
learned in the classroom to the
business world, several under-
graduate students at the Universi-
ty have already started their own
companies. The process, many of
them found, has presented new

challenges outside academics.
Drew Leahy, a senior in the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance,
first started MyBandStock.com
during his second year at the Uni-
versity and is now overseeing the
site with Business junior Bobby
Matson and Engineering senior
John-Michael Fischer.
The company, Leahy said, pro-
vides fans the opportunity to
"invest in their favorite bands" by
allowing fans to earn shares with
various bands by increasing traffic
to the site. These shares can then
be applied toward perks such as
backstage passes and meetings
with band members.
Describing MyBandStock as an
"online stock exchange," Leahy
said the start-up fizzled out at the
outset, but he hopes that a new

business model will re-energize
the site, which will launch tomor-
row. He added that the failure gave
him a real world lesson in running
a business before he ever gradu-
ated college. "That's just a reality
of starting a business: failing and
understanding what works and
what doesn't work," hesaid.
After making those initial mis-
takes, Leahy said the reward of
establishing a successful company
has been well worth his time and
effort.
But MyBandStock represents
just one of several student busi-
ness ventures that began at the
University.

alum who was in the College of
Engineering, said one of the big-

Program pulled from
city in 2003 after
only two years
By STEPHANIE BERLIANT
Daily StaffReporter
Last year, Robert Bobb, emer-
gency financial manager for Detroit
Public Schools, declared that the
district faced a "reading emergen-
cy."
At that time, Detroit Public
schools established The Reading

Corp - a program that calls for
volunteers to tutor Detroit pub-
lic school students in reading for
a total of 100,000 hours - after
results of the National Assessment
of Educational Progress math test
revealed students in Detroit Public
Schools had the lowest scores inthe
nation.
Despite these low scores, Detroit
remains without one of the most
visible national organizations
working to improve troubled public
school systems around the country:
Teach for America.
TFA - a program that places

recent college graduates with
schools in low-income areas to
teach for a period of two years -m
first came to Detroit in 2001. And
though the University has consis-
tently been a leader in applicants
to TFA, the program departed from
the nearby city after only two years
there.
TFA spokesperson, Kaitlin Gas-
trock, said the program decided to
remove participants from Detroit
due to district-wide downsizing.
"There weren't enough positions
available for our corps members'

Habitat for Humanity

While many students
join extracurricular activi-
ties to build their resumes,
those who join Habitat for
Humanity do so to build
something far more impor-
tant.
Habitat for Humanity
has made a name for itself,
building homes for low-
income families nation-
wide. And, locally, the
University's chapter of the
organization sponsors one
house in either Ann Arbor
or Ypsilanti every year.
University alum Jessica
Perszyk, president of Habi-
tat at the University, said
the group works with local
families to build houses
every Saturday.
"Adults in the family (in
need of a home) have to

work 300 sweat equity
hours with our organiza-
tion," Perszyk said. "We
build alongside the family,
so we have a great relation-
ship with them."
When they are finished
building or renovating a
home, Habitat dedicates the
house to the family, accord-
ing to LSA junior Emily
Goyert, community rela-
tions chair of the group.
The ceremony, she said,
begins with welcoming
words from the Family Sup-
port Partner and is followed
by a prayer. Before the rib-
bon is cut, the family who
receives the new home is
also presented with a quilt
from the community along
with "a bible, tool kit and
welcome mat".

"A house dedication is a
gratifying experience where
volunteers, family members,
and friends all join together
to celebrate the completion of
the new home," Goyert said.
In addition to their work
on houses in the area, Habi-
tat works with Food Gath-
ers and the Delonis Center
- events organized by
Goyert in an effort to serve
meals to the homeless. Last
year, Habitat also raised
$10,000 through fundrais-
ing events such as a casino
night and the "Beat OSU
Fun Run".
Perszyk said she applied
for a State Farm Insurance
grant early lastsummer that
would match the amount
they had fundraised. Once
notified of the acceptance

in October, Perszyk inter-
viewed with Habitat Inter-
national to discuss the
University chapter's use of
the money.
Habitat is currentlyusing
the funds to build their
tenth house in Michigan.
LSA sophomore Chanhee
Han, a member of the orga-
nization on campus, said
working with Habitat has
been a rewarding experi-
ence.
"I truly enjoyed working
directly with the people we
help and raising awareness
for numerous good causes,
such as the value ofafamily,
home, and community, on a
campus, both in high school
and college," Han wrote in
an e-mail interview.

Nearly 50 inmates
involved in Wash.
prison fight
A Washington state penitentia-
ry spokeswoman says guards used
pepper spray to break up a fight
involving nearly 50 inmates at the
Walla Walla prison.
Spokeswoman Shari Hall said
yesterday that an initial fight
between two inmates broke out
Tuesday evening in a commons
area of one of the prison's close-
custody living units. She says
guards resolved that fight but a
second fight involving multiple
inmates broke out within min-
utes.
The Walla Walla Union-Bulle-
tin reports that several prisoners
were injured but none required
transport to a hospital. Hall says
no significant staff injuries were
reported.
Nearly 50 inmates have been
placed in segregation. Hall says
units in one complex also are on
lockdown as staffers investigate
the fight.

North Korea
detains American
a ~hMa border
North Korea said today that it
has detained an American man
for trespassing on its border with
China, the second arrest of a U.S.
citizen reported by the commu-
nist regime in the past several
weeks.
The man was detained Mon-
day and is now under investiga-
tion, the North's official Korean
Central News Agency said in a
brief dispatch. He was not identi-
fied by name and the report pro-
vided no further details.
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing
said Thursday that it did not
know of the case.
North Korea said late last
month that it was holding anoth-
er U.S. citizen for "illegally enter-
ing" the country through the
North Korea-China border.
The North did not identify
the man detained in Decem-
ber but is widely believed to

be Robert Park, an American
missionary who South Korean
activists say crossed into the
country over a frozen river sev-
eral days earlier to raise the issue
of human rights in the North.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Deadly fish virus
 found in Lakes
Superior, Michigan
A fatal fish virus has been
detected in Lake Superior for the
first time, meaning it has spread
to all the Great Lakes, researchers
said yesterday.
Cornell University scientists
said they recently detected viral
hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS,
while testing fish in the largest of
the Great Lakes.
VHS has been identified in 28
freshwater fish species within
the Great Lakes watershed since
2005, including popular sport and
commercial varieties such as wall-
eye, muskellunge and whitefish.
Although not dangerous for
humans, the virus has caused
large fish kills in Lakes Ontario,
Erie and Huron. It also has turned
up in Lake Michigan.
Even so, officials in Michigan
and Wisconsin said yesterday
there was no evidence of a wide-
spread outbreak in Lake Superior.
They said the Cornell findings
would not lead to any immedi-
ate changes in boating or fishing
regulations.

PRES. OBAMA: 'I DON'T QUIT'

In State of the
Union, Obama vows
to seize the reins of
his presidency
WASHINGTON (AP) - Declar-
ing "I don't quit,"' President Barack
Obama fought to recharge his
embattled presidency with a State
of the Union vow to get jobless mil-
lions back to work and to stand
on the side of Americans angry at
Wall Street greed and Washington
bickering. Defiant despite stinging
setbacks, he said he would fight on
for ambitious overhauls of health-
care, energy and education.
"Change has not come fast
enough," Obama acknowledged
yesterday night before a politician-
packed House chamber and a TV
audience of millions. "As hard as it
maybe, as uncomfortable and con-
tentious as the debates may be, it's
time to get serious about fixing the
problems that are hampering our
growth."
Obamalookedto changethe con-
versation from how his presidency
is stalling - over the messy health
care debate, a limping economy
and the missteps that led to Christ-
mas Day's barely averted terrorist
disaster - to how he is seizing the
reins. He spoke to a nation gloomy
over double-digit unemployment
and federal deficits soaring to a
record $1.4 trillion, and to fellow
Democrats dispirited about the
fallen standing of a president they

hoped would carry them through
this fall's midterm elections.
With State of the Union messag-
es traditionally delivered at the end
of January, Obama had one of the
presidency's biggest platforms just
a week after Republicans scored an
upset takeover of a Senate seat in
Massachusetts, prompting hand-
wringing over his leadership. With
the turnover erasing Democrats' S
enate supermajority needed to
pass most legislation, it also put a
cloud over health care and the rest
of Obama's agenda.
A chief demand was for law-
makers to press forward with his
prized health care overhaul, which
is in severe danger in Congress.
"Do not walk away from reform,"
he implored. "Not now. Not when
we are so close."
Republicans applauded the pres-
ident when he entered the cham-
ber, and even craned their necks
and welcomed Michelle Obama
when she took her seat. But the
warm feelings of bipartisanship
disappeared early.
Democrats jumped to their feet
and roared when Obama said he.
wanted to impose anew fee on banks,
while Republicans sat stone-faced.
Democrats stood and applauded
when Obama mentioned the eco-
nomic stimulus package passed last
February. Republicans just stared.
On national security, Obama
proclaimed some success, saying
that "far more" al-Qaida terror-
ists were killed under his watch
last year in the U.S.-led global fight
than in 2008.

President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address in the House chambers at the U.S. Capitol Building last night.
Speaking about the current state of the economy, Obama said "the worst oftthe storm has passed."

Hoping to salve growing disap-
pointment in .a key constituency,
Obama said he would work with
Congress "this year" to repeal the
ban on gays and lesbians serving
openly in the military. But in a con-.
cession to concern about the move
among Republicans and on his own
party's right flank, Obama neither
made a commitment to suspend the
practice in the interim nor issued a
firm deadline for action.
The president devoted about

two-thirds of his speech to the
economic worries foremost on
Americans' minds as reces-
sion persists. "The devastation
remains," he said.
Obama emphasized his ideas,
some new but mostly old and
explained anew, for restoring job
growth, taming budget deficits
and changing a Washington so
polarized that "every day is Elec-
tion Day." These concerns are at
the roots of voter emotions that

once drove supporters to Obama
but now are turning on him as he
governs.
Declaring that "I know the anx-
ieties" of Americans' struggling
to pay the bills while big banks
get bailouts and bonuses, Obama
prodded Congress to enact a sec-
ond stimulus package "without
delay," specifying it should con-
tain a range of measures to help
small businesses and funding for
infrastructure projects.

Defense lawyers
rest case in trial
for gay marriage

divorce after 30-year marriage

Judge may reach
final decision in
March or April
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
first federal case to decide if the
U.S. Constitution prevents states
from stopping same-sex weddings
came to an anti-climatic break
yesterday after a judge heard
nearly 12 days of -wide-ranging
testimony on the meaning of mar-
riage, the nature of sexual orien-
tation, and the role of religion in
shaping attitudes about both.
Attorneys for sponsors of Cali-
fornia's Proposition 8 tentatively
rested their case after introducing
materials from the 2008 election
campaign.
They called just two expert
witnesses, including David Blan-
kenhorn, president of the New
York-based Institute for Ameri-
can Values, who capped the his-
toric proceedings by saying the
rights of same-sex couples should
come second to preserving the
cherished social institution of
marriage.
Chief U.S. District Judge

Vaughn R. Walker heard the
case without a jury and said he
will take time to review the evi-
dence before allowing closing
arguments, probably in March
orApril He has-no deadlinefor
reaching a decision.
After testimony ended, Walk-
er came down from the bench
and shook hands with both legal
teams.
"I just want to take a moment to
congratulate you (on) what a good
job you've both done," he said,
calling ita fascinating case.
His eventual verdict is likely to
be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
Throughout the trial, lawyers
for the two gay couples who filed
the lawsuit seeking to overturn
the ballot measure tried to show
the U.S. Supreme Court has rec-
ognized marriage as a funda-
mental right and that there is no
lawful reason to deny it to gays.
They also argued that Proposi-
tion 8, which passed with 52 per-
cent of the vote, was a product of
anti-gay prejudice rooted in reli-
gion and psychological theories
about homosexuality that have
long since been discredited.

Former presidential
candidate fathered
child during affair
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Eliza-
beth Edwards has separated from
husband John Edwards, the for-
mer presidential candidate who
lied about cheating on his cancer-
stricken wife and the child he
,fathered during his affair.
The disclosure yesterday came
as a longtime aide to the two-time
candidate promotes a tell-all book
that provides an unflattering por-
trait of the couple and the tumul-
tuous relationship they tried to
maintain after he first acknowl-
edged the liaison.
Elizabeth Edwards, 60,
declined to comment through a

friend, Andrea Purse, who con-
firmed the separation. However,
Elizabeth's sister told The Asso-
ciated Press that she remains
strong.
"She's doing as well as you could
expect," Nancy Anania said. "I'm
really proud of her that, somehow,
she's got strength that you rarely
see in a person."
A week earlier, John Edwards
finally confirmed that he fathered
a child, now alm s 2 years-old,
with his mistress, Rielle Hunter.
He issued a brief statement yester-
day, expressing care for his wife of
more than three decades and the
mother of four of his children.
"It is an extraordinarily sad
moment, but I love my children
more than anything and still care
deeply about Elizabeth," he said.
Purse did not reveal how long

the couple has been apart. North
Carolina law typically requires
couples to be separated for a year
before divorcing.
. It's another wrenching twist
for a couple that had previously
weathered the death of a 16-year-
old son and Elizabeth's ongoing
battle with incurable cancer.
They were law school sweet-
hearts who got married just days
after they took the bar exam
together-in the summer of 1977.
Though John Edwards, 56, later
went on to make millions as a trial
lawyer, the couple had humble.
beginnings: He had to borrows
money from her parents for a one-
night honeymoon. She always,
wore her $11 wedding ring. For,
years they spent their anniversa-
ries going to Wendy's, just as they
did on their first one.

Educating educators
Focus on fieldwork will prepare School of Ed students
Students in the University's School of Education may have an
opportunity to have more exposure to their future work-
places sooner than they expected. Changes to the program
will replace the current curriculum of the School of Education
with one that would emphasize more hands-on training within the
classroom. Considering the importance of education in Michigan's
changing economy, it's vital that Michigan teachers are receiving
a comprehensive education. And that while increased fieldwork
is important, students should continue to receive the theoretical
components of the curriculum. The School of Education should
strive to combine increased experience with theoretical learning
to produce teachers that will prepare a highly-skilled workforce
for a Michigan economy dependent upon education.

The proposed program, which is sched-
uled to go into effect at the start of the fall
semester, is called the Teacher Education
Initiative. Deborah Ball, dean of the School
of Education and organizer of the initiative,
claims that the new curriculum would be
modeled after current medical and nursing
curricula, which place a greater emphasis
on hands-on training. The intention of the
program is to make teacher candidates more
familiar with the realities of a classroom
before they enter the profession. Though
there is time before the program officially
begins, Ball is hoping that the faculty of the
School of Education will begin experiment-
ing with initiating the program into their
curriculum this semester.
The School of Education's efforts to better
the teachers it produces are admirable, espe-
cially during the current economic climate.
Improved education at all levels is critical to
ensure the success of an economy that will
depend upon highly-skilled science and tech-
nology businesses in the future. And while
institutions of higher education may play a
more visible role in the increasing need for
education, improvement is necessary across
the spectrum of education.
Successful nursing and medical schools
have shown that practical application
allows students the chance to prepare for

the professional world in a learning envi-
ronment. Similarly, the increased focus on
fieldwork that the School of Education's
revamped curriculum will encourage will
provide education students with an invalu-
able experience. Teaching relies heavily on
effective interaction with students, and ear-
lier introductions to the environment will
help to prepare future teachers for the real-
ity of the classroom.
But the shift of focus to fieldwork
shouldn't make the School of Education for-
get about the importance of the theoretical
knowledge that students are exposed to in
classes at the University. This theoretical
knowledge of teaching methods and the
challenges facing public education will help
new teachers to challenge the status quo
and push for education reform. The School
of Education needs to make sure that with
all of the excitement about the new curricu-
lum, students will still receive the vital class
instruction that will improve their knowl-
edge on the craft of teaching.
The state. needs good teachers and
improved education to pull itself out of
its current economic turmoil. The Uni-
versity must combine classroom learning
and firsthand experience to produce the
most effective teachers that Michigan
will depend upon.

Help stop human trafficking

The girls wear red dresses while watching
cartoons on flickering televisions. They stare
with dead eyes, their hope broken, and wait.
Their names are replaced with numbers - wiping
away the last of their identity and dignity.
Behind windows, gazing at these girls with
disturbingscrutiny, men stand shoulderto shoul-
der and choose which they will buy. By selecting
from the numbers available, they condemn the
unnamed girls to a life of abuse and rape.
This is one of many examples of child exploi-
tation. This is the story told by Love146, a char-
ity devoted to the prevention and abolition of
human trafficking.
Human trafficking, rape and oppression are
realities for millions of children. An estimated
1.2 million children are sold into this shell of a
life each year. And an estimated market of $32
billion exists because of these sales. Every min-
ute, approximately 2 children are bought. That
means that each time you listen to your favorite
song, about 7 children's lives are forfeited. And
during one of your lectures, about 180 children
are procured as sex commodities or soldiers, for
labor or another callous reason.
These children, stolen with lies, coercion
or force, will probably never see their families
again. Impoverished families are tricked with
false pretenses of employment into sacrific-
ing their children to this life. Ignorance blinds
them to the fate that inevitably lies ahead for
those closest to them. Homes and communities
are destroyed by someone's sick acquisition of
another human being.
Boys and girls, some as young as five years
old, are sold to brothels. South Asia holds the
most prominent and numerous of these intern-
ments. Their customers come most commonly
from Japan and the United States. Ancient cities,
famed for their exotic beauty and exquisite tem-
ples, are stained with blood, as this crime against
humanity exists behind closed doors. These are
places you could never imagine, where predators
travel thousands of miles to reach, places where
their prey is plentiful and on display.
Intertwining criminal networks and ill-
informed, unequipped law enforcement com-
bined with various other reasons, trafficking is
exceedingly difficult to combat and abolish. In
fact, child trafficking is increasing. Some 27 mil-
lion are currently enslaved around the world,
and 10 million are enslaved in the Trans-Atlantic
division of the slave trade alone.
But people exist who work tirelessly to stop
these atrocities from occurring. The aforemen-
tioned charity, Love146, is lne of these orga-

nizations. Created solely to work for greater
prevention and aftercare, this charity was
founded in 2002 after months of deep inves-
tigation into one of the darkest facets of our
world. Lovet46 trains aftercare workers, cre-
ates safe homes for those affected, develops
educational programs in high-risk areas and,
most importantly, offers a voice to the victims
of this modern-day slavery. They offer hope to
people who may otherwise remain unaware.
Completely nonprofit, abolition is their ulti-
mate and commanding goal.
Love146 was named after a girl viewed in a
brothel by members from the charity who were
gathering evidence by impersonating customers.
Co-founder Rob Morris saw amid the sea of bro-
ken souls, to his amazement, one girl with fight in
her eyes. She stared, not at the television screens,
but through the glass at the men. Her name will
never be known, but her number - her brand -
will live forever. "146" - which was her cell num-
ber - now creates hope and new life.
Living in Ann Arbor, college students are
sheltered more than we know. While we hear
about the failing economy (many of us actually
feel it firsthand at home) and other hardships,
here in our little bubble, the world seems to be
passing by carelessly. But the world is in tur-
moil and it's our responsibility as the future
workforce and leaders of tomorrow to fight for
what we believe is right.
If you want to fight atrocities like child traf-
ficking, there are numerous charities, like
Love146, that you can be a part of. To be a part of
the fight, go to lovel46.org. Here you can donate
to the charity and find ways to spread the mes-
sage of child trafficking. You can learn to host an
event, book a speaker, or even start a task force
on campus or in your town. Any aid can help save
another child from this barbaric life.
Whether this information comes as a shock to
your small slice of college perfection or it's sim-
ply one of those things that "just exists" on the
other side of the world, it's our duty to inform
ourselves of the cruelties permeating on our
watch. Will you return to feigning ignorance, or
will you stand and fight?
These children are the same age as your
younger sisters and daughters. What would you
do if a member of your family lived like this? Each
time you look into your loved one's eyes and see
hope and life, think of those who stare with eyes
glazed over in pain and darkness.

VIGIL
From Page1A
As more people gathered, candles
were passed out while music contin-
ued to play in thehbackground. Then,
the vigil began with a brief Power-
Point presentation recapping the
events and aftermath of the earth-
quake.
Followingthepresentation,which
included resources on how students
could get involved with the Haiti
relief efforts on campus, President
Mary Sue Coleman addressed the
crowd that had come to pay respects
to those affected by the devastating
earthquake.
Coleman told those at the vigil
that though the current aid efforts
are vital, it is important for them to
remember that aid will be needed in
the longterm, too.
"Our challenge in the future is
going to be not to forget when Haiti
is no longer on the front page of the
newspaper, and we don't see it on the
news every night, that we are still
willing to give money because it is
going to take a long time to rebuild,"
Coleman said.
Following Coleman's speech,
Associate Prof. Emeritus Ruth Bar-
nard from the School of Nursing
and Armando Matiz, a researcher
and lecturer from the School of
Public Health, spoke to the crowd -

efforts.

Pluijm has done a really good job
of digging in deeply and we were
way ahead of ourselves in getting
this report ready."
Van der Pluijm said the biggest
section of the report is the assess-
ment of the learning environment
at the University. He said as part of
this, the committee came up with
learning outcomes tailored to every
school and college, which outline
what is expected of students grad-
uating from the University.

And despite the uncooperative

Van der Pluijm said as part of the

"(The vision statement) is from

officers and it received input from a
lot of other people on campus to try

"It's an extension of our mission

Van der Pluijm added the com-
mittee dedicated a portion of the

It was in Nov. 2001 when Ryan

he was "losing his kids."
"I was teaching an astronomy
unit, and I had just glued stars

said. "The whole room was trans-
formed to a solar system for the

result of a shrinking student popu-
lation and budget challenges the
district faced."
At the end of the first year in
Detroit, it remained uncertain
whether TFA teachers would be
guaranteed placements the next
year. It was then that TFA made
the decision not to send any more
participants to the city. The teach-
ers already there were given the
choice to finish . their two-year
commitments to Detroit or move
elsewhere.
Adding to the problems was a
fracture in TFA's partnership with

The Office of Multi-Ethnic Stu-
dent Affairs formed M-HEART,
which led the coordination efforts
for the planning of the vigil, days
after the earthquake struck in order
to unify the entire campus' effortsoto
assist with the devastation. MESA
formed the coalition after multiple
student organizations reached out
demonstrating their interest in
offering aid to the country.
"M-HEART is a student-led orga-
nization determined to make an
impact in any way possible to the
relief efforts," MESA Intercultural
Development Program Director
Linh Nguyen said. "Starting with

Because of the University's
exemplary reputation, the HLC
has allowed the University to select
one topic for a special emphasis
study. The HLC only allows insti-
tutions they feel will be adequate
in each of the aforementioned cat-
egories, like the University, to pro-
duce such reports.
In 2000, the University focused
the self-emphasis study on inter-
disciplinary cooperation. This time
around, the study will concentrate
on internationalization.
With over 4,000 international
undergraduate students and an
ever-increasing sense among the
student body that the University is
part of a global community, van der

was a logical choice.

abroadl:8ullivan, sai the ,Jniver-
sity chose this theme to advance
the study abroad program. "We're
thinking about different models,"
Westside Multicultural Academy,
Gall said he experienced his fair
share of challenges. The fifth-
grade class he taught was com-
prised of kids taken from two other
classes in the middle of the year.
"I said,'OhmyLord, it's Novem-
ber and I'm startingethe first day of
school," he said.
Gall said his students literally
kicked and screamed on the floor
and received a number of suspen-
sions when he first started. But by
the end of the year, his students
had made a year and a half's worth
of progress.
Classroom challenges like these
are to be expected for many TFA
teachers across the country. But
Gall said being transferred was
rarely experienced outside of
Detroit. Most teachers in the city
were transferred at least once and
some weren't placed until well
after the first day of school, he
said.
At the end of his first year, Gall
heard TFA would be ending its
partnership with Detroit Pub-
lic Schools after his second year,
making his the only class of TFA
teachers to work in Detroit.
According to Gall, the major-
ity of TFA teachers in Detroit,
including himself, decided to stay
in the city. But despite choosing to
remain in Detroit, only a handful
were offered teaching positions
after their second year.
"Myself and my roommates all
finished out the end of the second
year and they pretty much told all
of us they had no place for us to
stay," Gall said. "A lot of us scat-

tered to the winds, and only about
S or 6 teachers got job offers."
According to a February 20,
2009 Detroit News article, it was
widely believed the Detroit Fed-
eration of Teachers - the Detroit
Public Schools teachers union -
pressured the district into getting
rid of the TFA teachers.
Gall agreed with this assess-
ment, saying the teachers' union
played a key role in TFA's depar-
ture.
"The whole state of Michigan
is extremely unionized," he said.
"Teachers' unions run whatever
alternative teaching placements
there are. If the union doesn't sup-
port something, it doesn't have
much of a chance. And the unions
were not in love with TFA."
Detroit Public School adminis-

the vigil, we also hope to initiate a
donation drive and form long-term
rebuilding efforts with a focus on
education in Haiti."
LSA junior Ghita Vagher, one of
the students who reached out to
MESA, has already begun formulat-
ing future plans to continue provid-
ing support for the country in the
future.
Vagher said that one of
M-HEART's goals is to reach out to
as many student organizations as
possible that wish to help with the
cause. Additionally, Vagher said she
hopes to host a concert and a fund-
raising dinner in the near future to
raise money.
she said. "I think the old model of
spending one semester of my junior
year in Florence isn't what people
want to do for study abroad any-
more."
"I think that they've got differ-
ent ideas in mind. Maybe it would
be three weeks in Beijing and three
weeks in Nairobi and comparing
and contrasting what you saw in
terms of water treatment systems
in those two places," she continued.
"There's a lot more ways to make it
relevant to your program and more
than tourism."
Sullivan said though many
questions remain about what
changes may need to be made
to the University's study abroad
office, the University may consid-
er consolidating the study abroad
offices.
"Other Big Ten schools have
a single study abroad office, we
;dpn't," Slliran said, "We tendIn
have each school or college develop
its own. That would be a logical
thingto look at."
trators and the Detroit Federation
of Teachers did not return phone
calls or e-mails from The Michi-
gan Daily.
TFA officials are currently
exploring the option of return-
ing to Detroit within the next few
years.
In an e-mail interview, Ify
Offor, vice president of new site
development for TFA, wrote there
has been "a lot of local support for
bringing Teach For America to
Detroit."
According to Offor, TFA has
been talking with city leaders
including Mike Tenbusch of the
United Way and officials in Gov.
Jennifer Granholm's office.
Though University graduates
interested in TFA don't have the
option of being placed in Detroit,
many undergraduates participate
in various programs in the Detroit
metro area, with student organi-
zations working at Detroit Public
Schools.
LSA senior Hannah Lieberman
is a member of The Detroit Part-
nership, a student group that does
volunteer work in Detroit. After
being involved with the organiza-
tion for three and a half years and
now the director of the group's
School Program Team, Lieberman
said Detroit's need for qualified
teachers is apparent.
Lieberman said Detroit's non-
compliance with TFA is surprising
given the school district's lack of
resources.
"It's a huge hole in their ideol-
ogy," she said. "In an area of such
need and especially in a school
system that's really struggling

with changing administrations,
not meeting 'Adequate Yearly
Progress' as determined by No
Child Left Behind, Detroit Pub-
lic Schools could use really great
teachers."
Today, Gall is the principal of
Indianapolis Lighthouse College
Preparatory Academy, but his
affection for Detroit hasn't waned.
"If someone were to call me
tomorrow, I think I'd jump at
the opportunity (to return to
Detroit)," Gall said. "Not that
I don't love it here, but I've told
wife many times I would've
taught there until retirement.
I love the kids; I love the city.
Detroit's a punchline all over our
media these days, but something
about Detroit grows on you."

Michigan Theater soaks up the Sun

Sundance USA brings
renowned indie film
festival to Ann Arbor
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Once .a year, snowy Park City, Utah plays host
to one of the largest film festivals in the world:
the Sundance Film Festival. Over a 10-day
stretch, 200 independent films make their
debuts to an audience of over 40,000 filmmak-
ers, critics and pilgrimaging cinephiles. About
half of these films find major distributors, with
a few going on to receive Oscar gold.
Tonight, Ann Arborites will get a chance
to experience Sundance close to home, as the
Michigan Theater features the premiere of
"Cyrus" in the Festival's inaugural installation
of a new event, Sundance USA.
"For more than 40 years, the Sundance Film
Festival has been this place where films pre-
miere - ideas getting tossed around, all this
dialogue happening, and emotions - and it all
happens in this one little town," said David Cou-
rier, Sundance Film Festival senior programmer.
"Unlike other festivals, we're not really affili-
ated with the city we're in - we're not the Park
City Film Festival - we're very much a festival
for the nation and, we'd like to think, the world,"
he said.
"That makes us the perfect ones to spread our
tentacles across the United States."
This past summer, the Sundance Film Com-
mittee made the decision to expand its films to
audiences all around the nation, bringing eight
direct-from-festival films to eight different
venues, including the Michigan Theater. These
films are being screened for audiences nation-
wide who'may not be able to make the Utah trek,

in addition to the other screenings in Park City.
"We've been fostering these voices of inde-
pendent artists for so many years, and we want-
ed to transport these artists in the extent of their
voices and ideas beyond the mountains of Utah
and into these different communities," Courier
said. "They're all communities that have shown
a passion for alternative cinema and that's why
they were chosen."
Most of the eight theaters selected, includ-
ing the Michigan Theater, are part of Sundance
Institute's Art House Project, a collective of
mostly smaller cinemas that foster an apprecia-
tion of independent film in their local communi-
ties.
"It was very important for us to have audi-
ences that are interested in talking about film,"
Courier explained.
Directors Jay and Mark Duplass ("Baghead")
and star Jonah-Hill ("Superbad") will be pres-
ent at the Ann Arbor screening of "Cyrus." The
directors will lead a Q&A session afterward,
where audience members will get a chance to
ask the filmmakers about their work.
"One of the reasons we wanted to do this is
that we wanted to bring the experience of being
at Sundance Film Festival to each one of these
cities," Courier said.
"What that means is that you're not justgoing
to the movie theater, buying some popcorn and
watching the movie," he said. "You're seeing a
film that's being introduced by the people that
made the film, and you're staying afterwards
and talking to them."
"And we're going to have a video ahead of
time, a little message from Robert Redford, a
taste of Sundance that way as well. We're trying
to replicate the experience of being at the festi-
val as much as we possibly can."
Meanwhile, the Michigan Theater stays
perched on East Liberty, a lingering remnant of
Ann Arbor's rich and lustrous history and the

golden age of Hollywood itself. To the Michigan
Theater, at least, time stands still. Inside, gold
leaf moldings ornament the expansive halls,
double stairways swirl down from the chande-
lier-bathed balcony and an assortment of illus-
trious Ann Arbor founders loom prodigiously
above. The year could very well be 1929. Only
the ever-changing marquees signal the evolving
landscape outside - the capitalized film titles no
longer read "The General" or "Modern Times"
but rather "The Maid" and "Crazy Heart."
Largest out of all the independent theaters
participating in the project, the Michigan hous-
es a whopping 1,700 velvet-lined seats in its
Historic Theater, where "Cyrus" will be shown
this Thursday. For the past few weeks, the the-
ater has done its own share of preparation for
the event, as festive lamppost banners line the
streets and a massive billboard emerges from
I-94.
For five years, the theater has enjoyed a spe-
cial relationship with Sundance and its Art
House Project, which supports independentcin-
ema through special screenings and talks.
"It's really the special relationship with Sun-
dance that we're trying to promote," said Lee
Berry, marketing director of the Michigan The-
ater. "It's the hype behind it; people absolutely
get excited about special events."
Tickets for the event have already sold out,
and half were sold before audiences even knew
which film was being screened.
"Because of all the hoopla that comes with
it, it's an event - it's more than just a movie,"
Berry said. "It enables us to put more behind
it in terms of marketing, get a whole lot more
excitement."
Already, Sundance USA is looking to expand
in future years.
"It hasn't happened yet, but with all the
excitement and energy about it, I can only think
we have to do it again," Courier said.

COURTESY OF ATLANTIC/F-STOP
Ben Gibbard and Jay Farrar are among the many musicians who will be performing at the 33rd Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festival
Folking around at Hill

By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Music Editor
Jay Farrar is no stranger to the folk tradition. A
songwriter nearly all his adult life, Farrar's music
with seminal bands Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt is
a prime example of the genre's
breadth, bridging aspects of punk 33rd A
rock and traditional country
through ragged guitars and his own Ann Arbor
narrative lyrics. Folk Festival
But his appearance at the 33rd
Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festi- Friday and
val tomorrow night highlights Saturday,
another aspect of American folk 6:30 p.m.
- namely, the literary tradition Hill Auditorium
of the Beats. Along with Ben Gib-
bard (lead singer and songwriter
for indie rockers Death Cab for Cutie), Farrar will
be performing songs from 2009's One Fast Move Or
I'm Gone, a collaborative project between the two
songwriters based on prose from Jack Kerouac's
1962 novel "Big Sur." The record also doubled as an
extended soundtrack for Jim Sampas's documenta-
ry of the same name.
"There was probably an element of a kid being
unleashed in a candy store," said Farrar of the project
in an interview with the Daily. "I was so familiar with
Jack's work and I was just inspired to be able to, in a
weird way, work with Kerouac, or at least his words
and his concepts."
The lyrics throughout the record borrow heav-
ily from Kerouac's actual prose, with Farrar adding
some of his own Midwestern experience in between.
"I started with the poem at the end of the book,"
Farrar said, explaining the writing process behind
One Fast Move tracks "Breathe Our Iodine" and "Low
Life Kingdom." "With those songs in particular I had
to do a little more filling in with some of my own
words to make it a little more cohesive."
As a lifelong fan of Kerouac's work, writing and
recording the album had a uniquely personal effect."
'Big Sur' resonated in a way because I was at a sim-
ilar age as Jack was when he was writing about the
experiences in the book," he explained.
Gibbard and Farrar met while shooting the Sam-
pas documentary, in which both artists provided
their own personal commentary on Kerouac's
prose. Farrar had previously worked with Sampas
on a tribute to Bruce Springsteen's iconic Nebraska
record.
"Jim must've had me in his Rolodex file or some-
thing," Farrar joked.
Gibbard shares songwriting credit and sings
throughout the album, giving Farrar's earnest, achier
vocals a lighter, more boyish foil. The pair have been
touring through the late fall, showcasing tracks from
OneFast Move throughout the country and garnering
much favorable press along the way.
But Farrar is convinced the project's success
comes from the chemistry between the two song-
writers.

"That's probably what gives the project strength,"
Farrar said. "We have a shared sensibility and pretty
much speak the same musical language."
Folk music tends to breed the kind of sensibility
Farrar describes - an environment where artistic
collaboration and impromptu, organic performance
reign supreme. Ask any of the performers at this
year's Ann Arbor Folk Festival and they'd probably
agree.
Hosted by historic folk venue The Ark, the annual
festival - all proceeds from which benefit continued
operations and programming at The Ark - has been
bringing top names in contemporary and traditional
folk music for over 30 years. Now in its 33rd year, the
event brings yet another fantastic lineup to Hill Audi-
torium this weekend.
Beginning Friday evening, dream-folker Iron &
Wine will headline alongside Gibbard and Farrar,
with additional support from Philadelphia bluegrass/
Americana outfit Hoots & Hellmouth, Jer Coons
and Po' Girl. Saturday night features Rosanne Cash,
Richie Havens and the incomparable Doc Watson as
headliners, with Raul Malo, Hot Club of Cowtown
and Enter the Haggis supporting. Singer-songwriter
Grant-Lee Phillips (the mastermind behind '90s rock-
ers Grant Lee Buffalo) performs both nights, with
Patty Larkin emceeing.
In keeping with the trend of recent years, Friday's
lineup aims to represent more of the contemporary,
Jay Farrar and Ben
Gibbard turn into Beat
poets at the Folk Festival.
younger talents within folk music, while Saturday
showcases roots-ier acts and shifts the focus toward
more veteran performers. Last year even featured a
brief appearance by the legendary Pete Seeger.
Appearances like Seeger's play a central role in
keeping the folk tradition alive at events like the Folk
Festival - while many of the younger faces in last
year's crowd may have been unfamiliar with all but a
few of Seeger's songs, all could recognize his warmth
and undeniable influence on the artists and devotion
to the craft.
Folk music, like the emotional urgency of punk
rock or Beat poetry, survives precisely because of
the kind of stewardship between older and younger
artists, dead writers and contemporary muses. It's
exactly the kind of community that makes writing
songs from a Kerouac-like stream-of-consciousness
an inherently folk endeavor.
"There's an immediacy to it that can't be denied,"
Farrar said. "Acoustic music is important because it's
nobile, you can take it anywhere."
The 33rd Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festival begins at
6:30 p.m. tomorrow night at Hill Auditorium.

Everything seems to be bigger than life!
(It's just today's Full Moon energy.
Rela.)
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Some aspect of your private life defi-
nitely will be made public today. People
wilt notice you, especially bosses, par-
ents, teachers and VPs. Just be awae of
this.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
This is an accident-prone day, espe-
cially related to travel. Take extra pre-
cautions. Similarly, avoid heated discus-
sions about race, politics and religion.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Yeamight have to fight for your share
of something today. Issues about inheri-
tances, shared property, taxes and insur-
ance matters could come toea head now.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Today's Full Moon is directly opposite
your sign, and this creates stress between
you and partners or close friends. Your
only alternative isto display grace under
pressure. Mellow out.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Don't be overly aggressive with co-
workers on the job today. And don't be
aggressive with other people if it's
related to small pets, your own health
issues or some kind of hygiene factor.
It's just today's Full Moon madness.
YOU BORN TODAY You're social
and fun-loving. You enjoy the company
of others. You have a strong sense of
social justice and fair play; invariably,
you fight for the underdog. You are tol-
erant, broad-minded and interested in
many things. However, you are some-
times just eel sre what yea want. Your
year ahead will be wonderfully social
and beneficial for partnerships.

Oprah Winfrey, TV host; Tom Selleck,

For Friday, Jan. 29, 2010
ARIES
(March21 to April 19)
The Full Moon tension today can
cause difficulty with friends and groups.
This makes dealing with children and
romantic partners challenging! Stay
frosty.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
You'll need extra patience today to
deal with the challenges of home and
family versus career and your public rep-
utation. You just can't keep everyone
happy.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
The Full Moon today can create
accident-prone conditions for you.
Therefore, be careful, slow down and
allow extra time for everything. Be cau-
tious when driving, walking and jog-
ging.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Today's Full Moon can create finan-
cial tension for you. This tension could
be about disputes related to money mat-
ters or about possessions. It's your inter-
ests versus the interests of others.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Who are you going to put first today
- your wants and needs, or the wants
and needs of others? This is the kind of
dichotomy that every Full Moon can cre-
ate.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
The tension from today's Full Moon
could create problems for you at work or
even with your health. You feel you have
to make a choice. Perhaps you do.
Choose wisely.
LI BRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
This is a rocky day for romance,
sports, social occasions, the entertain-
ment world and the hospitality industry.

Haunting melodies
wash ashore on Beach
House's new album
By JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
It's official: Beach House is here to stay.
When a band flat out nails its aesthetic
only two albums into the game, it's only
natural to worry that all
the band's consecutive
albums will be increas-
ingly lukewarm per- Beach
mutations of the same
sweet formula. With House
2008's Devotion, Beach Teen Dream
House seemed to have Sub Pop
its sound figured out u
to a tee. The Baltimore
duo had struck a spectrally aching bal-
ance among noir-y, reverb-drenched gui-
tars and retro-kitsch organs and drum
machines, all wrapped up in the ominous
blanket of Victoria Legrand's snake-
charming alto. And the end result was an
inimitably haunting mutation of bedroom
pop that seemed almost too perfect to
tamper with.
While Teen Dream largely retains the
tone of syrupy dreaminess that made
Devotion such an emotionally engaging
listen, it proves Beach House is not con-
tent to rest on its laurels. Where Devotion
was brittle and sparse, slinking along

with an icy seductiveness, Teen Dream
is sweeping and warm, with powerhouse
melodies towering like wedding cakes.
From the lushly cherubic vocal layering.
on "Take Care" to the white-noise cli-
max of splashing cymbals, gurgly moans
and quivering synths on the aptly titled
"10 Mile Stereo," Teen Dream's wall-of-
sound grandiosity pulls out the big guns
without compromising the band's hyp-
notic appeal.
A huge component of the album's
larger-than-life feel is its almost alarm-
ing pop sensibility. While Devotion was
anything but short on melody, its thrills
hinged mostly on down-tempo eeriness
rather than bona fide hooks. And though
nothing from Teen Dream will ever make
as much as a peep on FM radio, the
record finds the band stepping out of the
shadows and channeling its introspec-
tive wistfulness into friendlier, heavier-
hitting compositions.
The instant the chorus of opener
"Zebra" starts up, with Legrand's vel-
vety lilt snuggling against a carousel of
lit-up guitar and synthesizer, the album
smothers the listener in its thawing
embrace. "Norway" is especially impres-
sive, taking this newfound pop charisma
and hovering it over a melting wasteland
of heroin-addled guitars and wavery
synths, attesting to the fact that the
band's recent clarity hasn't whitewashed
its aura of mystery.
Perhaps the biggest surprise on Teen
Dream is that you can actually bob your

head along to a couple of the songs. "Sil-
ver Soul," with its fuzzy-monster guitar
throb and crunchy snare-tambourine
hits, sounds like something Zeus would
bop along to in his bathrobe. And "Walk
In The Park" coasts along on an insistent
shaker and pulsating drum machine, illus-
trating how the words "shoegaze" and
"dancy" aren't mutually exclusive.
Still, to say Teen Dream's electrified
vibe is a wholesale improvement on the
"old" Beach House would be stretching
it. While the band has certainly opened
its sound up in terms of warmth, layer-
ing and sheer massiveness, the individ-
ual songs occasionally feel a little bit too
grounded, incessantly building without
ever truly evolving, or overstretching the
same idea without much wiggle-room.
"Zebra" gradually piles on the shakers,
backing vocals and crash cymbals in
traditional slow-burn fashion, but rides
squarely on a verse-chorus-verse-chorus
cycle. And "Walk In The Park" follows
this same rigid structure without much
variation at all, save for its shimmery
outro.
But, ultimately, the album's moderate
lack of movement doesn't really clash
with its chi. Teen Dream's mesmerizing
ocean of noise is meant to be surfed on
dreamily anyway, and the single-mind-
edness of each song almost adds to the
record's overall trance. So snuggle up in
your bed, light some incense and blast
this album at full volume - you won't be
disappointed.

By EMMA JESZKE
Daily Arts Writer
Basement Arts is kicking off its winter
season with a nontraditional style of the-
atrical production. Rather than producing
a single play with one
set of characters and ,Art'and'A
one plot, the first free
student performance to iglt Ade'
grace Studio One thisT
semester consists of two Tonightthrough
separate one-acts, cho- Saturday at 7
sen independently by p.m.,tomorrow
two student directors. at11 p.m.
The evening of one- Walgreen
acts will include "Art" Drama Center
by Yasmina Reza,
directed by School of Music, Theatre &
Dance sophomore Porscha Kazmierc-
zak and "A Slight Ache" by Harold Pinter,
directed by School of MT&D freshman
Doron Bloomfield.
The two shows were lumped together
for purely logistical purposes by the Base-
ment Board. But "Art" and "A Slight Ache"
overcome their drastically different plot-
lines: "Art" tells the story of three feud-
ing middle-aged best friends and "A Slight
Ache" glimpses into a peculiar afternoon
of an elderly couple in a dead marriage.
The two shows have a number of running
parallels thematically and stylistically,
creating a surprisingly cohesive are of the-
atrical experience for their audience.
"Both shows have three people in them,
and both require minimal design elements,"
Bloomfield said. "It seems superficial, but
it's actually not. The idea of three people in
a context of basically an empty space and
seeing how they interact, I think that raises
a lot of questions with the audience."
The connecting thematic elements stem
from the two one-acts' mutual concentra-
tion on human relationships.
A pair of student-
directed plays about
troubled people.
"I think (both plays) speak to people's
inabilities to communicate and connect,"
said Bloomfield. "In 'A Slight Ache' (the
characters) have this match seller that
they are focusing on because they can't
focus on each other, and in 'Art' they are
looking at this painting and are trying
to find meaning in it rather than trying

to find meaning in the relationships they
have."
The characters in each show are at dif-
ferent points in their lives and therefore
demonstrate different takes on human
relationships. "A Slight Ache" has a heavi-
er tone and explores roles in relationships
as they relate to death and dying. "Art," on
the other hand, attacks the idea of rela-
tionships in a more immediate way, con-
fronting what the meaning of friendship
is, what binds people together and why
people hold onto friendships as they dete-
riorate.
Kazmierczak feels that because the two
one-acts explore similar thematic subject
manner in different ways, they will work
well in preparing audiences for the emo-
tional arc of the production.
"Laughter is the best way to open up
people for sadness," Kazmierczak said. "So
I think that it'll be a good experience if my
show ends up going first. If ('Art') appeals
to people's sense of humor, then they will
be ripe and ready to start crying for ('A
Slight Ache')."
"Art" isn't purely comical with its
weighty themes, but the witty dialogue
and eclectic characters arguing with one
another are sure to get audiences laugh-
ing. According to Kazmierczak, one of the
reasons "Art" is funny is that it mirrors our
own experiences with friends.
"The second I read it, I recognized every
tactic that I ever used in an argumentwith
my friend when trying to get what I want,"
Kazmierczak said. "I thought it was really
incredible that someone could capture that
in these characters."
This production will also feature some
fresh names and faces for Basement Arts,
as many students involved with this pro-
duction are newbies.
LSA senior Emily Heider is participating
in her first Basement Arts show as Flora in
"A Slight Ache."
"I definitely think that having both the
leads (in 'A Slight Ache') as (non-perfor-
mance majors) will give a fresh perspec-
tive," Heider said. "Because people who
typicallygo to BasementArts showswould
have never seen me before, maybe it will
give them a different outlook on the char-
acter or even just a different approach to
acting."
Branching out from the nuclear cast and
traditional production style, "Art" and "A
Slight Ache" have much to give to potential
audiences.
"There is never not a reason to see the-
ater," Kazmierczak said. "It's never a waste
of time, it's never harmful, it will always
add something-to your life."

Hagelin's play and Swedish heritage
make him a fan favorite at Yost Arena

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
Giant flags from Scandinavian
countries don't often have a natural
place at Michigan sporting events.
But a 120-square-foot Swedish
national flag has blended into the
game-day atmosphere perfectly at
Yost Ice Arena lately.
Maybe it's the blue and yellow
color scheme. Or maybe it's junior
forward Carl Hagelin. The Soder-
talje, Sweden native leads the Wol-
verines in goals and points this
season.
After struggling to register
points as an underclassman, Hage-
lin is just four points away from his
career-high season total with elev-
en games remaining on the sched-
ule. Despite his scoring touch, it's
the group Hagelin spearheads, the
penalty kill, tlat has generated
some of the loudest cheers this sea-
son.
Against Ferris State, while kill-
ing a two-minute five-on-three,
the Wolverines gave up just one

shot. Hagelin played a major part
in the kill as he picked up the puck
in the neutral zone, skated a giant
circle around the zone and fired it
away, killing off about 20 seconds
of penalty time by himself. By the
time the penalties were over, the
only people sitting down in Yost
Ice Arena were those on the bench.
Those kind of plays, along with the
goals, and, according to Hagelin,
his nationality, have put him in the
spotlight all season.
"(Fans) like PKplayers," Hagelin
said. "Killing off penalties is prob-
ably a huge part of it. And then the
fact that I'm not from here, that
helps a lot too. Something that's
different is usually something fun,
that's probably a big part of it."
But the support was growing
long before this season. In some
ways, it started before he even
stepped on the ice.
The Michigan hockey team had
to run the stairs of Michigan sta-
dium in the weeks leading up to
Hagelin's freshman year. There,
he displayed the extraordinary

work ethic that has built rapport
with fans and earned him the title
of alternate captain. He didn't just
beat everybody; he blew everybody
away, according to Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
"He has worked his bag off from
the first day I met him," Berenson
said. "Never being told, never being
pushed, never challenged. I haven't
seen a kid with a better work ethic
from scratch than Carl Hagelin."
The crowd noticed Hagelin
shortly after that, and the Swedish
flag started popping up last year. It
was notably smaller than the cur-
rent flag, and near the top rows of
the student section. It moved down
a couple rows this season, and was
accompanied by a Texas flag and
a Canadian flag when Hagelin
played on a line with Texan fresh-
man Chris Brown and Canadian
sophomore Louie Caporusso.
But after the line was broken up,
the flags disappeared completely.
That is until Engineeringsopho-
more Rob Eckert, after conferring
with his friends, decided to make

the behemoth that has become a
mainstay just to the right of the
opponents' bench - by hand.
"I asked my mom around Christ-
mas time when I saw her if I could
borrow her sewing machine," Eck-
ert said. "She was like 'What are
you making?' I (told) her I was
making a Swedish flag, a big one.
And my Mom made it for me for my
Christmas present."
The flag, which looks like it was
stolen directly from the United
Nationsbuilding, was unveiled two
weeks ago for Michigan's game
against Alaska.
"It's pretty hard not to recog-
nize the big flag," Hagelin said.
"It's obviously an honor, so keep it
coming."
While Eckert, who is not of
Swedish descent, has no current
plans to add to his giant flag col-
lection, he did mention there were
discussions of a Texas flagto honor
Brown. But one issue makes its
success questionable: The color
scheme is off.

ByCHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
Coming into this season, the
Michigan basketball team rested
its laurels on its 3-point shooting.
As the 3-ball went, so did the Wol-
vermnes.'
So as the season begins to wind
down, it's clear
that Michigan NOTEBOOK
has been consis-
tent of late in just one area - its
defense.
While Michigan continues to
have shooting woes from behind
the are, its defense is becoming
more and more of a strength. Tues-
day night, Michigan held the Spar-
tans to just 57 points while forcing
18 turnovers, converting those
into 25 points. In last week's game
against Wisconsin, the Wolverines
held the Badgers to just 34 percent
shooting and Michigan's defense
helped them pull off the upset win
over then-No. 15 Connecticut.
While some of those turnovers
were simply a result of careless-
ness by the Spartans - passing the
ball out of bounds or lobbing cross-
court passes that sailed wide - the
Wolverines did get their hands in
the passing lanes and picked off
the ball several times.
"That was a big thing just being
solid on defense, not taking the
gamble," freshman guard Darius
Morris said. "But when you see the
opportunity to pressure up on your
guy or deflect the pass, that was
really stressed in practice and I
think we really did that today."
Junior Manny Harris had five
steals on the night, including one
that flew out of the hands of a Spar-
tan guard and into the backcourt,
where Harris easily picked it up
and laid it in for two points.
The Wolverines took a two-
point lead into halftime largely
because of their defense.
"Our defense is really getting
up to par," Morris said. "Big Ten
defense, we're rebounding we're
holding opponents to 20 points in
the half, which is really big strides
for us."
While the defense continued to
play hard and force turnovers in
the second half, it was clear that
Michigan State's athleticism down
low gave them a key advantage.
What was troubling for the
Wolverines was the ease with
which Michigan State was able to
get some of its baskets. While the
Spartans rarely had open looks
from outside, Michigan State for-
ward Raymar Morgan killed the
Wolverines down low, scoring a
game-high 20 points on 8-for-9
shooting including a seemingly
preventable layup in the final min-
utsthat pulled Michigan State
And while the defense made
many stops and forced turnovers,
it failed when it was needed most.
Spartan Kalin Lucas found an
opening in Michigan's 1-3-1 zone
and buried the game-winner.
"Our defense is our defense,"
Beilein said. "It's good sometimes
or sometimes we're just either
outmanned or they're stronger or
their guy just makes a shot and we
miss one. It's that simple."

:

Ryan leads the team with 129
rebounds, including 44 offensive
boards. Freshman guard Dayee-
sha Hollins is second on the team
with just 29. Ryan's second effort
gives Michigan the second chanc-
es it needs to stay in games with
top contenders.
"Rebounding-wise, it's impor-
tant," Borseth said. "It comes
along with our strategy. We just
move the ball, we cant rely too
much on new things."
In all but one of the Wolver-
ines' eight losses, they were out-
rebounded by their opponents.
And in all of those games Michi-
gan had fewer offensive rebounds
than its foes.
But to capitalize on those
rebounds, the Wolverines will be
forced to get into a rhythm early,
and they should continue to take
their perimeter shots even if their
shooting starts off slow.
"We needed to get stops," Hicks
said before the season. "We have
to come back, finish the play, and

take it right back. That's really a
big part of winning."
Michigan has to be flex-
ible enough that any missed shots
early in the matchup will not limit
the shots they take later in the
game. Because, as they've shown
all season, the Wolverines are a
second-half team.
Michigan is averaging37 points
a game in the second half this
season, but just 31 points in the
first. Illinois will have to compete
against a team that has proven,
time and time again, it has the
stamina to fight consistently for
an entire 40 minutes.
Tonight's game may be more
important than any other this sea-
son for the Wolverines, a win will
make them a possible contender in
the Big Ten, but a loss may haunt
them like their 68-48 loss tqWis-
consin on Jan.10, which triggered
a three-game losing streak.

Enough is enough.

things happen she had a very posi-
tive productiontonight. She had a
couple assists and a steal, scored
four points, had four rebounds -
that's pretty positive."
Borseth put Jordan up to the
challenge again in last weekend's
victory over the Hoosiers when
she was the first sub he called in
off the bench just six minutes into
the game.
And while her game hasn't
been flawless - in last Sunday's
game she allowed two turnovers
and went up for a block that the
Hoosiers easily got around - but
for an athlete with only 70 min-
utes of total playing time, she has
been a much-needed spark off of
the bench.
"I just keep working hard
because I know coach doesn't
want to see us quit," Jordan said
after the 58-56 loss to the Buck-
eyes at home. "As long as I keep
working hard I think I am gaining

his trust."
Sophomore guard Courtney
Boylan has been Borseth's main
go-to player off the bench all year
and continues to provide energy
the team needs, playing an aver-
age of 15 minutes per game. But
the Wolverines (3-6 Big Ten, 11-8
overall) can benefit from another
dependable bench player - espe-
cially in games like last weekend's
against Indiana, for which three
starters were out for much of the
first half with multiple personal
fouls.
"She makes a lot of things
happen, it's just a matter of get-
ting more time and maturing
with age," Borseth said. "I knew
it when I recruited her that she
would be that kind of player. She
learns as she goes like the rest of
the young kids. She shows a great
effort. She's my kind of player.
She really sells the farm on every
play."

Jalen Rose a hit in return to Ann Arbor

Former Fab-Fiver
brings color and
his "Rose Garden"
to Crisler Arena
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Jalen Rose sure knows how to
steal the spotlight.
It's been nearly two decades
since his knee-length shorts, black
socks and trash-talking attitude
were front and center at Crisler
Arena, but the former Fab Five
point guard is still hard to miss,
even in the middle of a Michigan-
Michigan State basketball game.
He wasn't exactly sitting front
and center - "We gotta play for
the Pistons to get front-row seats!"
Rose said with a laugh - courtside
at Crisler Arena Tuesday night,
but in a bright red velour suit and
an ear-to-ear smile, Rose-certainly
stood out.
The ESPN cameras loved him,
cutting to shots of his jubilation
and dismay throughout the
game, and the Crisler crowd
gave him a standing ovation
when he was honored for his acts
of philanthropy, including his
foundation's Rose Garden and
scholarship endowment at the
University.
Rose, who said that he's

watched nearly all of the Michigan
basketball team's games this year,
knows how badly the Wolverines
needed to win on Tuesday. Playing
the optimist, Rose still holds hope
that Michigan can not only make
the tournament, but also get past
the first or second round.
"You want to have progress," he
said. "We got to the tournament
last year, but we lost to Oklahoma.
Hopefully, we can go a step
further."
It's no accident the word "we"
kept slipping out of Rose's mouth
when he talked about the Michigan
basketball program. Rose, who left
Michigan for the NBA after his
junior season in 1994, has played
basketball all over the nation in the
16 years since he's been gone. But
he still says that Ann Arbor feels
like home.
It's also not far from his actual
hometown, Detroit.
These days, the star-studded
combination of junior Manny
Harris and senior DeShawn
Sims, both Detroit natives, draws
comparisons to Rose and Chris
Webber, the Fab Five's dominant
duo from Detroit. Harris and Sims
are the Wolverines' first Detroit-
based wrecking crew since Rose
and Webber.
"Absolutely, I'm happy to
see Manny, I'm happy to see
DeShawn," said Rose, who last
visited Ann Arbor when Harris
was a freshman. "They're both

playing well, doing their thing."
In his three-year career at
Michigan, Rose tallied 1788
points, 478 rebounds, 401 assists
and 119 steals. He went on to play
for six different NBA teams, and
currently works as a basketball
analyst for ESPN.
At halftime of Tuesday's game
against Michigan State, Rose's
in-game analysis was spot-on. And
actually, it was a pretty accurate
description of the Wolverines' play
all season.
"They're playing hard, they're
playing hard," Rose said when
Michigan led 27-25 at the half.
"Gotta knock down a couple of
threes, but other than that, I think
we're in good shape."
The Wolverines ended up
suffering a one-point loss to the
Spartans. Of all people, Rose
understands the Michigan-
Michigan State rivalry - and how
painful a loss to the Spartans can
be.
When asked about his favorite
rivalrymomentfromthethree years
he played in it, he didn't hesitate. It
was a 73-69 victory in East Lansing,
and Rose made sure the Spartan
crowd wouldn't forget it.
"When we won at Michigan
State, and I got a chance to sit on
the 'S' at half court," Rose said
with a laugh.
It makes sense that he'd love
that, too. Once more, he's Jalen
Rose, front and center.

Cheapening spring break
How to have a kick-ass break without breaking your wallet
By Allie White I Deputy Magazine Editor

Don't waste your money on bot-
tied water.*Sure, your parents told
you never to touch anything that
has come out of a faucet south of
the Mason Dixon line, but come
on now. You've been drinking alco-
hol and eating Backroom Pizza for
a while now - your stomach and
intestines should have toughened
up at this point. You can handle
whatever surprises the tap water
has to offer.
Buy your alcohol at the duty-
free store in the airport when you
land. You'll probably pay around
the same in Mexico for Patr6n as
you would for El Toro in Michigan.
Sadly, the higher-end liquor doesn't
come with an adorable plastic som-
brero like the cheap stuff does, but
you can probably look past it for a
smoother finish.
Save the fancy restaurants for
when your parents are footing the

bill - embrace the authenticity and
cheapness of beach-hut food. Who
cares if you don't know how to ask,
"Is this mysterious lump on a stick
chicken?" in Spanish. Think of it as
cultural immersion and go with the
flow, man - you're on spring break!
"Excursion" is really another
way for a hotel to say "We're going
to put you on a smelly bus, drive
nine hours into the jungle to look
at a stone that may or may not be
really old, serve you a stale roll
instead of the four-course lunch
we promised and charge you a lot
of money for it because we can." If
you really want to venture outside
of the comfortable all-inclusive
bubble you're staying in, try to
find cheaper alternatives to hotel-
sponsored trips. Don't be afraid to
ask the staff or guests for other, less
expensive ways to explore the area.
Just please remember tobe safe and

Save your pesos and spring for sun-
screen instead. You won't be able
to enjoy the trip you've spent.your
money on if you're bed-ridden with
third degree burns, wallowing in
self-pity and aloe.
Completely avoid hotel costs by
simply pitching a tent or unrolling a
sleeping bag on the beach and com-
muning with nature. Beds, showers
and ceilings are overrated. You'll
get to wake up to the sun rising over
the ocean, fresh air in your face and
stray dogs peeing on your suitcases.
Another plus of the sleeping-on-
the-sand strategy is that you'll be
guaranteed a prime location for
lounging in the sun even if you're
not down to wake up at the crack
of dawn to compete with everyone
else for beach chairs. And most
importantly, there's no tipping the
chair boy when you need neither
the boy nor the chair.
