Tuesday 
evening, 
Central 

Student 
Government 
hosted 

their first meeting of the school 
year under new administration, 
with 
LSA 
senior 
Anushka 

Sarkar as president. Despite 
the brief interruption of a fire 
alarm in the Michigan Union, 
the meeting continued, focusing 
on welcoming members back to 
campus.

A major focal point of the 

meeting involved the Trump 
administration’s announcement 
this morning of the dissolution 
of the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals program. 
Under the new policy, those who 
have a status that will expire in 
the next six months can have 
their permits renewed. During 
these six months, Congress 
has the responsibility to decide 
whether these policies will move 
forward and if those protected 
under DACA will officially lose 
their status.

Community 
member 

Kate Stenvig, member of the 
University’s chapter of By All 
Means Necessary, addressed her 
concerns to CSG following a rally 

in the Diag and march around 
campus earlier in the afternoon. 
She stated that she hopes, in the 
coming weeks, to bring forward 
a resolution in support of DACA.

“This is a real overreach of 

Trump to try to do this,” she said. 
“It’s also a really desperate act 
because basically all that he has 
promised is a lot of deportation.”

Sarkar 
also 
voiced 
the 

importance of CSG taking a 
stand against this act from the 
Trump administration. Earlier 
in the day, CSG posted a status 
on Facebook informing those 
currently reliant on the program 
of their options to secure permit 
renewal.

“CSG has for the last couple 

of years and will continue to this 
year stand by DACAmented and 
undocumented students,” she 
said. “DACAmented students 
are an important part of our 
community.”

Sarkar also discussed the 

recent racist writing found on 
the Rock and detailed CSG’s goal 
of responding to these sorts of 
incidents in meaningful ways. 

City 
Council 
passed 
a 

resolution 
Tuesday 
taking 

a stand against the Trump 
administration’s controversial 
travel ban.

Trump issued his first 

executive order in January, 
forbidding 
citizens 
from 

seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries from entering the 
United States for 90 days, 
stopping 
resettlement 
of 

refugees for 120 days and 
indefinitely 
suspending 

resettlement 
of 
Syrian 

refugees. The ban, which 
came into effect immediately 
after 
its 
announcement, 

resulted 
in 
disorder 
and 

fierce protests at airports 
across the country.

The 
local 
resolution 

specifically authorized listing 
Ann Arbor as a supporting 
municipality in an amicus 
brief to be filed with the 
U.S. Supreme Court from the 
State of Hawaii and Ismail 
Elshikh v. Donald J. Trump, 
et al., which will determine 
the constitutionality of the 
president’s executive order.

Councilmember 
Jack 

Eaton (D–Ward 4) praised 
the resolution, as it will allow 
Ann Arbor to take a stand 
against the travel ban at no 
cost. He noted Ann Arbor’s 
unique position as a college 
town and the city’s tradition of 
welcoming talented individuals 
from all over the world.

“We want our residents … 

to feel comfortable to come in 
from anywhere in the world,” 
Eaton said. “Having a threat 
such as this travel ban really 
does significant harm to our 
town.”

Following two federal court 

decisions that blocked the ban, 
the 
Trump 
administration 

released a second version of 
the order that eliminated its 
most controversial parts. For 
example, provisions in the 
initial executive order like 
giving preference to religious 
minorities (widely interpreted 
to mean Christians) once the 
resettlement program resumed 
gave reason for critics to call 
the order a “Muslim ban.”

Chants 
denouncing 
the 

repeal of Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals filled the 
streets of Ann Arbor during 
BAMN’s Emergency Rally to 
Defend DACA early Tuesday 
evening. 
The 
Coalition 
to 

Defend 
Affirmative 
Action, 

Integration 
and 
Immigrant 

Rights 
By 
Any 
Means 

Necessary 
organized 
the 

protest as a result of President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
recent 

decision to rescind the DACA 
policy. 

BAMN’s list of demands 

included 
defending 
DACA, 

turning Ann Arbor into a 
sanctuary 
city 
and 
taking 

action to stop Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement raids 
and deportations. The event 
began with a rally explaining 
BAMN’s objectives in the Diag, 
followed by a march around 
campus.

Protesters 
included 
Ann 

Arbor 
community 
members 

and University of Michigan 
students 
from 
various 

backgrounds.

A portion of their flyer 

read, “This is the time to make 
our schools, campuses, cities 
and all of Michigan a real 
sanctuary for immigrants, by 
coming out in mass numbers 
to defeat Trump’s attack on 
DACA, stop his deportations 
and 
demand 
that 
Trump 

resign or be removed BY ANY 
MEANS NECESSARY.”

Kate Stenvig, an organizer 

for BAMN, explained how 
similar strategies have created 
change and why it was crucial 
to continue protesting.

“We think that right now is 

our moment to pull out all of 
the stops to build a movement 
to defend DACA, to stop the 
policy of deportation and to get 
rid of Trump now,” she said. “I 
think that the fact that Trump 
did not think that he could get 
away with getting rid of DACA 
today but gave a 6-month 
window for Congress to act is 
a real credit to the movement 
and that so many of the people 
who have DACA are leaders.”

Stenvig also discussed how 

she saw the DACA repeal as 
an act of desperation on the 
Trump administration’s part.

“I 
think 
that 
we 
can 

definitely defend DACA and 
force Trump to resign or 
get 
removed 
because 
this 

is a disgusting, scandalous 
overreach 
on 
his 
part,” 

Stenvig said. “It’s also his next 
desperate attempt to show his 
racist base that he can deport 
a lot of people, but in reality, 
because of the movement in 
the last year, he’s been able 
to deport less people than 
Obama.”

The DACA policy was put 

into place during the Obama 
administration in 2012. 

William Lopez, a postdoctoral 

fellow at the School of Social 
Work, noted many undocumented 
immigrants and their families 
were 
betting 
against 
the 

possibility of a rescission when 
they made the choice to register 
for DACA.

“Two, four, six years ago, 

whenever folks applied, they 
were thinking, ‘If I give the 
government this information, will 
it be dangerous for my family?’,” 
he said. “And we, as advocates and 
those with citizen privilege, of 
course encouraged them to do so, 
believing it would be safe to do so, 
and now we find ourselves in this 
position of wondering, is it safe?”

Currently, there are almost 

800,000 people in the United 
States 
with 
Deferred 
Action 

for Childhood Arrivals status, 
and some are students at the 
University of Michigan. Many at 
the University are now worried 
Immigrations 
and 
Customs 

Enforcement will begin targeting 
students once their status expires.

Laura 
Sanders, 
co-founder 

of the Washtenaw Interfaith 
Coalition for Immigrant Rights 
and a lecturer at the School of 
Social Work, said she, too, wasn’t 
optimistic about any legislation 
Congress would pass regarding 
the program.

“The ball is in Congress’s court 

to act, but they haven’t acted in 
the past in a very positive way, 
which is what initiated the DACA 
executive order by Obama in the 
first place,” she said.

The 
Trump 
administration 

announced Tuesday morning it 
was ending DACA, the Obama-era 
immigration policy that provided 
a renewable, two-year deferral 
from deportation and work permit 
eligibility 
to 
undocumented 

immigrants who were brought to 
the country as minors.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions 

stated 
Tuesday 
the 
program 

“is being rescinded,” but the 
administration will provide a 
six-month window in which it 
will continue to renew the DACA 
status 
of 
individuals 
whose 

status is about to expire, meaning 
individuals will begin to lose their 
protected status permanently on 
March 5, 2018. President Donald 
Trump said Congress should use 
the window to come up with an 
additional plan.

“I have a great heart for these 

folks we’re talking about,” he 
said. “A great love for them — and 
people think in terms of children, 
but they’re really young adults. I 
have a love for these people and 
hopefully now Congress will 
be able to help them and do it 
properly.”

Khaalid 
Walls, 

communications director of ICE 
for the Northeastern Region, 
which 
includes 
Michigan, 

said current ICE policy was to 
generally avoid sensitive areas 
like schools.

MICHELLE PHILLIPS/Daily

Trump decision to end DACA faces major backlash from Michigan politicians

“...in the best interests of our country, and in keeping with the obligations of my office, the Department of Homeland Security will 

begin an orderly transition and wind-down of DACA, one that provides minimum disruption.” -President Donald Trump

Attorney 
General 
Jeff 

Sessions announced President 
Donald Trump’s plan to end the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals program, which was 
founded under former President 
Barack Obama in 2012, Tuesday 
morning. In a written statement, 
Trump 
called 
the 
program 

unconstitutional, 
calling 
for 

“an 
orderly 
transition 
and 

wind-down of DACA, one that 
provides minimum disruption.” 
Trump also acknowledged that 
the six-month delay will allow 

Congress to address the issue 
before the change takes effect.

Current DACA beneficiaries 

receive 
renewable 
two-year 

work 
permits 
through 
the 

Department 
of 
Homeland 

Security. 
Under 
Trump’s 

order, DHS will stop accepting 
applications; 
however, 

applications that have already 
been 
submitted 
will 
be 

processed, 
and 
those 
with 

current permits will be allowed 
to work until their permits 
expire.

On campus, undocumented 

students fear for their futures. 

William Lopez, a postdoctoral 

fellow in the School of Social 

Work, studies how communities 
respond to ICE raids. Lopez said 
that once DACA is eliminated, 
it is not clear what will happen 
to 
the 
information 
of 
the 

beneficiaries of DACA.

“On the one hand, very 

practically, we are worried about 
how a number of our students 
who are funded will continue 
to be funded when they don’t 
have social security numbers 
anymore,” 
Lopez 
said. 
“So 

how are they going to remain 
in school, mostly in graduate 
school, when they don’t have 
social security numbers, when 
their funding may be tied to 
something that needs a social 

security number?”

Once the program ends, the 

current and past beneficiaries 
of DACA will be vulnerable, 
as they have entrusted their 
information to the government 
in order to benefit from the 
program.

“At the time of application, 

many folks are worried, ‘Well 
what is going to happen with 
this information if DACA doesn’t 
stay around?’,” Lopez said. “So 
in six months, we will know, or 
at least have a sense of what the 
central government is going to 
do with that information. At that 
time, if not before, there will be

It 
offered 
undocumented 

immigrants 
who 
came 
to 

the United States as minors 
the opportunity to receive 
deferred 
action 
from 

deportation and eligibility for 
a renewable, two-year work 
permit. To qualify, applicants 
must have all lived in the 
United States before the age 
of 16, not having any felonies 
or serious misdemeanors and 
living 
continuously 
in 
the 

United States since July 15, 
2007.

One of these individuals is 

LSA freshman Sandra Perez. 
Perez grew up in the United 
States and discussed DACA’s 
importance not only in her life 
but also in the lives of others.

“It really has no effect on 

other people besides DACA 
students, but it’s great to 
advocate 
for 
them,” 
Perez 

said. “For myself, being a 
DACA student, I feel that 
it really empowers me and 
other students. There are so 

many benefits from DACA, 
for me it’s my driver’s license, 
social security and so much 
more. Trump’s removal of the 
DACA program is absolutely 
insane, and it really doesn’t 
make sense because there are 
so many students benefitting 
from the program.”

LSA 
freshman 
Michelle 

Alvarez 
echoed 
Perez’s 

statement and discussed how 
the policy has helped many 
people in her own life.

“Although I’m not a DACA 

student, I have a lot of family 
and friends that benefitted a 
lot from DACA,” Alvarez said. 
“I just want to support my 
friends and family because it’s 
very important for them to stay 
and study.”

Alvarez acknowledged that 

the United States is the only 
home that many of the DACA 
recipients know.

“I strongly disagree with 

what Trump is doing,” Alvarez 
said. “Some of the DACA 
students came here when they 
were young. I have a friend 
who came to the U.S. at the 
age of one, so it’s like taking 

away who she is because she 
basically grew up here, and 
just deporting her to another 
country that she doesn’t know 
is wrong.”

Perez worries the repeal will 

create an atmosphere of fear 
for many DACA students, and 
cause them to become afraid 
to stand up for themselves 
because 
of 
the 
threat 
of 

deportation.

“Because 
of 
the 
DACA 

repeal, many students won’t 
feel as powerful; they will 
go back into hiding, and they 
won’t speak up for what they 
believe,” Perez said. 

Though 
the 
repeal 
has 

caused 
distress 
for 
many 

people, both Perez and Stenvig 
are hopeful that the BAMN 
rally and other actions from 
the University community will 
protect the students who are 
affected.

“I’m 
hoping 
that 
the 

University 
goes 
against 

Trump,” Perez said. “I feel 
like the U of M community 
can empower its students and 
include its diverse components. 
They can just try to help the 

students feel at home, feel 
like it’s safe, and feel like 
you can come here and find 
comfort. For me especially, 
I feel like if the University 
said, ‘We welcome you,’ then 
I’d feel like, ‘Hey, I want to 
go to U of M and I want to 
stay here.’ I want them to 
make me feel included and 
not make me feel alienated.”

Stenvig is also impressed 

with the amount of support 
the movement has received 
and is confident people will 
continue to remain united.

“We’ve already seen a 

huge outpouring of support, 
even on the first day,” Stenvig 
said. 
“People 
are 
really 

outraged about this, and I 
think what we especially 
want to communicate is that 
we are really strong and that 
we can see this isn’t the end 
of DACA and that we have to 
respond to this as this is our 
moment to come out strong 
and keep marching until 
we get rid of Trump and his 
policies.”

Every Wednesday, the Michigan 
Daily will be asking a University 
faculty member, staff member 
or student what the University 
bicentennial means to them. 

“It feels like a momentous time 
to join the University...I will be 
learning about the last 200 
years starting today. I came 
from D.C. when I got this job, 
and I certainly noticed a deep 
love of Michigan that is in many, 
many, many places. I wouldn’t 
be able to say what’s new at the 
University because it’s all new 
to me, but there is certainly a 
lot of excitement. I teach early 
American History so it’s an 
exciting opportunity to come 
here to talk about the history 
of Michigan and the University 
being a part of that history for 
a long time 
— a lot longer time 

than other Universities.”

not be “proactively provided” to 
ICE, “unless the requestor meets 
the criteria for the issuance of a 
Notice To Appear or a referral to 
ICE under the criteria set forth 
in (United States Citizenship and 
Immigration Services’) Notice to 
Appear guidance.”

“This 
policy, 
which 
may 

be modified, superseded, or 
rescinded at any time without 
notice, is not intended to, does 
not, and may not be relied upon 
to create any right or benefit, 
substantive 
or 
procedural, 

enforceable by law by any party 
in any administrative, civil, or 
criminal matter,” the page states.

Susan 
Reed, 
managing 

attorney 
for 
the 
Michigan 

Immigrant Rights Center, said 
in an interview with Michigan 
Radio people should still expect 
an increase in deportations as a 
result of the change.

“We heard Secretary Sessions 

say that upon termination of the 
program, people with DACA 
would not be priorities for 
deportation,” she said. “Which 
sounds meaningful, but then 
he said that if at any point they 
encounter 
an 
immigration 

officer, they would be issued a 
notice to appear in immigration 
court. So I would interpret that 
as meaning there aren’t any 
immediate plans to, say, take 
the DACA file and go knock on 
everyone’s door.”

Already, 
ICE 
activity 
is 

relatively 
high 
throughout 

Washtenaw 
County 
and 

southeastern Michigan. WICIR 
operates an “urgent responder” 
telephone line for people who 
need immediate assistance with 
immigration issues, and it has 
received over 800 calls in the 
past nine years, according to 
Sanders.

“Half of them have involved 

detainment or deportation of at 
least one adult, and we know that 
hundreds of children have lost 
their primary parent,” she said. 
“We also know that thousands 
of children have lost a providing 
adult.”

The reason for the high level 

of activity, she explained, was 
the proximity of the Canadian 
border.

“A lot of people think of 

immigration 
enforcement 
as 

happening down on the southern 
border, but we’re within 100 
miles of the northern border, and 
we have very robust immigration 
and customs enforcement teams,” 
she said. “All of them have quotas 
that they are supposed to meet of 
people who they are supposed to 
detain and deport.”

In an email to students Tuesday 

night, University President Mark 
Schlissel criticized the Trump 
administration’s 
decision, 

saying 
the 
University 
was 

working with other institutions 
and organizations to pursue 
legislation allowing the program 
to continue.

“We are deeply disappointed 

in today’s announcement that 
the 
administration 
will 
end 

DACA, the Deferred Action on 
Childhood Arrivals program,” 
he wrote. “We want to assure 
everyone in the University of 
Michigan family that we are 
working to understand all of 
the implications of this change, 
the timelines we face, and how 
members of our community may 
be affected.”

University spokeswoman Kim 

Broekhuizen said the University 
would do what they could legally 
to protect students’ identities.

“The University would not 

proactively share non-directory 
student information with ICE or 

other immigration enforcement 
officials, unless required to do so 
by public records laws, a lawful 
subpoena or warrant or judicial 
order,” she said.

Lopez noted it was additionally 

important that the University 
have policies in place backing 
their statements.

“We don’t just come to our 

department because we are going 
to be kind and use a particular 
set of words to make you feel 
welcome — this is certainly 
important — but we also want 
policies in place that defend 
people should they be pursued 
by 
immigration 
enforcement 

on our campus,” he said. “One 
conversation 
that 
needs 
to 

happen is, to what extent is 
campus law enforcement going 
to be involved in these events?”

Although 
it 
is 
not 
yet 

clear what orders the federal 
government may make regarding 
enforcement of the rescission, 
Diane 
Brown, 
spokeswoman 

for the University’s Division of 
Public Safety and Security, said 
the University would continue 
following current policy.

“DPSS will follow an existing 

practice of not asking students 
(or 
others) 
for 
immigration 

status. The exception will be for 
people who commit crimes and 
are being processed,” she wrote 
in an email to the Daily. “Our 
protocols also do not include 
partnering with ICE, though 
of course we will adhere to any 
lawful orders.”

In a Facebook post Tuesday 

night, 
Central 
Student 

Government President Anushka 
Sarkar, LSA senior, and Vice 
President Nadine Jawad, Public 
Policy senior, issued a statement 
to students with DACA status, 
giving them instructions on how 
to apply for renewal if they were 
eligible.

“To 
undocumented 
and 

DACAmented students in the 
Michigan community: we stand 
in solidarity with you and we will 
fight alongside you to protect 
your right to an inclusive and 
safe education at the University 
of Michigan,” the post read.

time for us at the University to 
decide how we’re willing to and 
how we’re going to protect that 
information.”

Lopez emphasized that since 

the program’s inception, there has 
not been any official government 
action to end it until now. “In 
prior political moments, this was 
just illogical to attack because it 
was just political suicide,” Lopez 
said. “It looks bad. But that’s not 
the moments we’re in anymore.”

Several 
universities 
and 

colleges across the state offer 
in-state tuition to undocumented 
students regardless of DACA 
status, including the University 
of 
Michigan, 
Wayne 
State 

University, Grand Valley State 
University and several others.

In 
a 
statement 
released 

Sunday, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel reaffirmed his 
commitment 
to 
protecting 

all 
students 
regardless 
of 

immigration status.

“At the University of Michigan, 

we will continue to assess the 
consequences of any changes to 
DACA and keep our community 
informed,” Schlissel wrote. “I also 
want all students to know that I 
view their opportunity to study 
here as both the right thing to do 
and in our nation’s best interest.”

The 
Trump 
administration 

defended the move as a fair way 
to end the program by allowing 
some leeway for the transition 
and time for Congress to pass 
related legislation.

In his statement, Trump said 

his emphasis on immigration 
reform has not changed.

“Our enforcement priorities 

remain 
unchanged,” 
Trump 

wrote. “We are focused on 
criminals, security threats, recent 
border-crossers, visa overstays, 
and repeat violators.”

There are no current plans 

for DHS to share the personal 
information provided by DACA 
recipients 
with 
immigration 

enforcement agencies. In his 
statement, 
Trump 
“advised 

the Department of Homeland 
Security that DACA recipients are 
not enforcement priorities unless 
they are criminals, are involved in 
criminal activity, or are members 
of a gang.”

Both 
Republicans 
and 

Democrats have voiced opposition 
to 
ending 
DACA. 
Speaker 

Paul Ryan (R–Wis.) and other 
Republican leaders urged Trump 
not to end the program, according 
to the Washington Post.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Mich.) denounced the move to 
end the program in a press release, 
saying that Congress should react 
to Trump’s action.

“These young people were 

brought here through no fault 
of their own,” Dingell wrote. 
“America is their home and DACA 
has allowed them to become 
hardworking, 
contributing 

members of our society – offering 
their talents to the workforce 
and paying taxes that go toward 
improving 
our 
health 
care, 

infrastructure and other critical 
services.”

In Michigan alone, over 6,600 

undocumented immigrants have 
received protection under DACA, 
and over 840,000 undocumented 
immigrants 
have 
received 

protection in the United States, 
according to the U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services.

Following the announcement 

that Trump was ending DACA, 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) issued a 
press release, which criticized 
the decision and emphasized the 
important role immigrants play in 
the United States.

“Many are working toward 

success under the existing DACA, 
and for the certainty of their 
future Congress should act quickly 
to authorize and clarify their 
status,” the press release read. 
“In Michigan we will continue 
to honor everyone’s journey who 
has become part of our family of 
10 million people, and remain the 
most welcoming state in the nation 
for immigrants and dreamers 
seeking prosperity, a home and 
a community that is accepting of 
their family and their desire to 
succeed in America.”

In 
an 
emailed 
statement, 

the College Democrats at the 
University of Michigan voiced 
opposition to the move by Trump 
and voiced support for DACA 
recipients.

“President Trump’s decision to 

terminate DACA is an act of cruel 
and unambiguous xenophobia,” 
the email read. “We stand with 
DREAMers and their right to live, 
work, and learn in this country.”

The College Republicans at the 

University of Michigan did not 
respond to requests for comment 
at the time of this article’s 
publication. 

In March, the Daily interviewed 

several undocumented students 
to get a glimpse into their lives at 
the University of Michigan. While 
none of these students responded to 
the Daily’s request for comment at 
this time, many expressed fear over 
the potential end of DACA at the 
time of their interview.

One LSA student, who asked 

to be anonymous given their 
immigration status, said they were 
afraid for their family as well as 
themselves.

“Every 
morning 
you 
wake 

up, like not knowing, especially 
now, knowing whether or not 
my parents will get in trouble at 
work or something, especially 
now given that there have been 
a couple ICE (Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement) raids in 
east Michigan,” they said. “That’s 
always been kind of scary. It’s one 
of those things where you still are 
always worried whether you come 
home or you get a call saying this 
happened. You never know.”

Another 
undocumented 

Rackham student, who also asked 
to remain anonymous, said the 
end of DACA puts an extreme 
logistical strain on the lives of 
DACA recipients.

“If DACA gets taken away, that 

again puts us in a situation where 
we can’t work, we can’t drive, we 
can’t board a plane, we don’t have 
any way to identify ourselves so 
think of anything that you have 
that is tied to your ID, like going 
out and opening a bank account 
or buying liquor or tobacco,” they 
said.

I

’ve built up a tolerance 
to tragedy and disaster. 
Watching the news often 

leaves me feeling sick, 
with something stuck in 
my throat and eyes that 
are close to watering, 
but I somehow get past 
it and with a faster 
recovery each time. 

But 
Charlottesville 

made me sick and tired 
like I haven’t been in a 
while. The images from 
the 
protests 
disgust 

me. Until I saw college 
kids holding tiki torches and 
marching alongside Nazis, I 
had hoped obvious racism was 
a game less populated by people 
my own age.

Seeing young people march 

to defend hate left me angry 
and disappointed, but knowing 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union defended their right to 
march confused me. I could 
not understand how a group 
that is a prominent voice for the 
resistance defended one of its 
biggest opponents. The group that 
sent lawyers to airports to defend 
those 
affected 
by 
President 

Donald Trump’s travel ban now 
stands by white supremacists? 
That’s not what I expected.

I, like many other people, 

have focused so much on 
the 
ACLU’s 
defense 
of 

marginalized 
groups 
and 

became enamored with certain 
groups they defend that I didn’t 
look back and pay attention to 
everyone they have defended. 
Listening to “Smashing the 
Confederacy in the streets and 
on the screen” on the podcast 
“Politically Re-Active” helped 
me come to terms with what 
the ACLU did.

In the episode, Lee Rowland, 

an ACLU Senior Staff Attorney, 

confirmed that no one in the 
ACLU has the personal goal of 
defending Nazis. The position 

the ACLU took 
— 
defending 

neo-Nazis — is 
not 
new: 
The 

organization 
defended a group 
of 
neo-Nazis 

that 
planned 

a 
march 
in 

Skokie, 
Illinois, 

a 
town 
with 

many Holocaust 
survivors. 

Rowland explained that this 
defense 
was 
difficult 
for 

members of the ACLU to take 
part in, but they took this 
position in the hope that it 
would protect the free speech 
of civil rights groups. If that 
group of neo-Nazis received a 
permit or permission to protest, 
it goes against precedent if 
a civil rights group hopes to 
march peacefully but is denied 
that right. Learning this forced 
me to take a more realistic view 
of the ACLU; like the law, the 
ACLU has a lot of gray area.

I understand their argument, 

but I can’t bring myself to 
accept it because what I saw was 
wrong. It is wrong to scream 
slurs, it is wrong to use hateful 
speech to target minorities and 
it is wrong to carry guns, knives 
and 
makeshift 
weapons 
to 

intimidate and attack unarmed 
protestors. However, there’s 
no law against slurs. There’s 
no law against hateful rhetoric 
and there’s no ban on weapons 
at a protest. People will say 
what they want, and there will 
be arguments and controversy, 
but there should never be 
violence. No one should fear 
that they’ll be attacked for 
speaking out against a group’s 

beliefs, especially not in the 
United States. I know the ACLU 
focuses on ensuring that, but 
the way they sometimes try to 
do that makes me cringe.

I’m tired of seeing new poster 

children for racism and other 
forms of hate, but I don’t expect 
the campaign to end anytime 
soon. The fact of the matter is 
that hateful speech and words 
against it are protected by the 
First Amendment. But in terms 
of morality, it is obvious which 
is greater. No one knows when 
the collective moral compass of 
our country will work — it was 
broken to begin with.

But hopefully, despite living 

in a place where civil liberty 
advocacy groups are forced 
to defend those who want 
to threaten the community, 
the United States can go in 
a better direction. However, 
this depends on the work 
of everyone. One or a few 
organizations cannot be tasked 
with this, and we know that we 
can’t leave this in the hands 
of President Donald Trump. I 
think a piece of me looked at 
organizations like the ACLU 
and thought that they were 
the ones with power. Their 
spokesperson is the one on the 
news, and they are the most 
able to influence society.

But 
I 
realized 
that 
we 

have power. We don’t have a 
team of lawyers, but we have 
options. We can contact our 
representatives and work to 
educate ourselves by learning 
from each other. That is how 
we begin to see change, by 
taking action and working to 
fight ignorance.

T

o a lot of people, not 
having social media is 
extremely off-putting. 

As 
counterintuitive 
as 
it 

seems, being unable to stalk 
someone online is a source of 
unease. It’s a truly fascinating 
phenomenon of today’s society 
that I’ve only recently started 
to 
appreciate 
due 
to 
the 

creation of my own Facebook 
profile. In fact, just a couple 
of weeks ago I was talking to 
my roommate from freshman 
year — I roomed blind — when 
he confessed his surprise that I 
turned out to be so “sane, chill, 
cool, etc.,” considering that he 
couldn’t find me online prior 
to rooming together. For him, 
this was a “red flag” and led 
to countless amusing theories 
about my personality. 

Having 
been 
on 
social 

media for about a year and half 
now, I see his point. There is 
something a little unsettling 
about searching for someone 
and not being able to find 
any information about them. 
Though 
the 
main 
reason 

I joined Facebook was for 
practicality — joining groups, 
creating 
and 
discovering 

events 
and 
organizations, 

networking, etc. — you grow 
used to the convenience of 
being 
able 
to 
familiarize 

yourself with someone before 
actually 
meeting 
them. 
In 

a world where privacy is no 
longer 
the 
norm, 
straying 

from that norm may lead 
people to assume that you are 
odd, 
antisocial, 
unpopular 

or all three. After all, why 
would someone not utilize the 
available tools to keep in touch 
with friends and stalk them 
whenever they want?

Well, I can think of a few 

reasons. 

As you may have already 

guessed, 
when 
entering 

college, my online presence 
was nonexistent. In fact, the 
subject of my college essays 
detailed my animosity towards 
social media and subsequent 
hesitancy to participate. Back 
in those days, I referred to 
platforms such as Facebook 
and 
Instagram 
as 
“digital 

pseudo-realities” and “fenced-
in pastures” from which my 
friends 
couldn’t 
escape. 
It 

baffled me how they could 
waste 
hours 
looking 
at 

pictures of peers’ vacations to 
exotic destinations interlaced 
with superficial inspirational 
quotes and pleas for attention.

In the moments of weakness 

in which I would sneak a peek 

at one of my friend’s news feeds, 
it was like seeing the world 
from a different perspective. 
I was suddenly integrated in 
everyone’s life. As fascinating as 
this was, I immediately caught 
myself comparing my life to 
those of others. How was it that 
within such a short span of time 
I could go from being perfectly 
content with my life to doubting 
my own existence? Looking at 
photos of friends’ ridiculous 
accomplishments or of their 
yachting trips off the coast of 
Capri — which they never seem 
to be shy about sharing — is a 
shortcut to depression.

Some may feel that this 

is an exaggeration on my 
part. However, according to 

numerous studies conducted 
over the years, extensive social 
media use has been linked to 
negative effects on mood and 
well-being. In fact, according 
to a study recently published 
by the American Psychiatric 
Association, 
those 
who 
are 

heavily involved with social 
media are more than three times 
more likely to develop depression 
and anxiety than those who are 
minimally involved.

I’m not a psychologist, but I 

would guess that this anxiety 
stems from spending too much 
time admiring others’ lives, 
rather than living a life of one’s 
own. Whenever people go to 
a concert, go to their friend’s 
house, eat dinner, brush their 
teeth, take a crap, etc., phones 
are out almost all the time 
so that the whole occasion 
can be documented. People 
care more about their friends 
knowing that they were at an 
event than being engaged in 
the event themselves. 

Social Media Today stated 

that the average person spends 
about two hours a day on 
social media. Over a lifetime, 
that is equivalent to five years 
and four months. And for 
what? In five years and four 
months you can climb Mount 

Everest 32 times or run over 
10,000 
marathons. 
Instead, 

many wonder whether Kylie’s 
lips are fake or brood over a 
friend’s study abroad in Paris.

However, 
I 
must 
admit 

that 
since 
joining 
social 

media, I have developed a 
better understanding of why 
people spend so much time 
on 
Facebook, 
Instagram, 

Snapchat and other platforms. 
As depreciative as it is, there’s 
something 
addicting 
and 

entertaining 
about 
looking 

at memes, people’s opinions 
on current events and photos 
of friends. Most of all, I’ve 
found that social media is the 
perfect tool for avoiding social 
interaction 
and 
awkward 

situations. 
Don’t 
feel 
like 

talking 
to 
anyone 
around 

you before lecture because 
you’re antisocial? Perfect, just 
browse Facebook, Instagram 
or Snapchat to appear busy. 
Unfortunately, it seems that 
everyone under the age of 30 
uses this strategy just about 
anytime and anywhere.

It saddens me that I’ve 

succumbed to some of the 
behaviors 
that 
were 
once 

topics of admonishment in 
my college admissions essays. 
While I try to limit myself, I 
waste considerable amounts 
of time looking at a screen. 
And it’s only on an extremely 
rare occasion that I’ll say to 
myself, “Boy, am I glad that 
I checked my news feed!” 
Usually, I’ll exit social media 
with indifference, jealousy, 
a dwindling will to survive 
or annoyance at something 
someone said.

Though social media has 

made my life remarkably more 
convenient — and for that 
reason alone I would not delete 
it — it has done absolutely no 
good in terms of emotional 
well-being. I still use social 
media a miniscule amount 
compared to most, but my 
goal is to reduce this amount 
even further. When it comes 
to having an online presence, I 
truly believe that less is more. 
Therefore, when I’m getting 
ready to stalk someone and 
can’t find them on Facebook 
or 
Instagram, 
I 
will 
not 

automatically assume that they 
are odd. Instead, I will look 
at them with admiration for 
doing something that I have 
lost the strength to do myself.

I 
 

identify as a man who 
loves men; however, I’ve 
recently been hesitant to 

adopt the identity of “gay.” If 
you think about the average 
gay man, what archetype pops 
up? For me, it’s an attractive 
jock 
wearing 
revealing 

underwear, 
maybe 
posing 

with other equally attractive 
jock friends. Even if he’s not 
a jock, there are lots of other 
types of gay men that you could 
think of. The twink is lean, 
smooth and hairless; they go 
great with each other or more 
muscly types. Of course, the 
drag queen is campy and fun, 
or campy and mean, or campy 
and… you get the idea.

And finally, there’s me. I 

don’t fit any of those boxes 
of what a gay man should be, 
and, frankly, I don’t want to. I 
don’t want to be forced to go to 
the gym to get the perfect ass 
or be a catty bitch to establish 
dominance. I don’t want to 
conform, because I’m just getting 
comfortable with who I am. 
Recently, when I asked friends 
familiar with the nuances of 
gay men which type I fell under, 
the response was unexpected: 
“You’re just… normal.”

Now this isn’t a problem, per 

se, but the implication of the 
statement is that I’m no longer 
gay; if I were, wouldn’t I neatly 
or at least messily fit into one 
of the “normal types” of gay 
men? Wouldn’t I be a “normal 
twink” or a “normal jock?” 
What is a “normal gay?” What 
is “normal?”

I think that one can be a type 

and still be “normal;” however, 
I’m “normal” and I’m not a type 
— apparently not culturally 
“normal gay.” The identity of 
“normal” seems to sometimes 
override the identity of gay: 
I’m a man who loves men, but 
since I’m not a “normal gay,” 
I’m instead just “normal.” The 
ultimate question is, why is 
there this selective disconnect 
between being “normal” and 
being gay?

I believe the answer boils 

down to the exclusivity of the 
typology of gay men. Whenever 
you make a type, you make an 
in group and an out group. By 
definition, if you’re not in the in 
group, you’re in the out group. 
The problem with this is that 

the spectrum of in groups is 
selective, and overwhelmingly 
selectively white.

People have argued that gay 

men are super shallow when 
it comes to being fat, femme, 
transgender, 
disabled… 
the 

list goes on. If you’re not a 
“proper” body type you’re 
already facing an uphill battle 
to be considered attractive, 
as a “normal jock” or “normal 
twink.” This is not to say 
that Asian men can’t be jocks; 
however, it does mean that an 
Asian jock will be seen as less 
masculine, less desirable than 
a white jock simply because of 
their race. You can rinse and 
repeat for all marginalized 
identities: 
they’re 
inferior 

to 
the 
(white) 
hegemonic, 

dominant identity.

Furthermore, just as Asian 

jocks are seen as inferior to 
white jocks because their race 
feminizes them, this lends 
Asian twinks extra credence. 
The problem with this, besides 
clear fetishization, is that these 
standards are all determined by 
the dominant group in the gay 
community: white men. What 
this ultimately boils down to 
is that all marginalized people 
will never be able to truly 
reach in-group status (even if 
Kim Chi from “RuPaul’s Drag 
Race” has a fabulous critique 
of it all).

White gay men, therefore, 

generally dominate in all of 
these groups. If you fit, you 
can pick your poison as to 
which type you’d like because 
they’re 
all 
communities 
in 

which you’ll find people who 
look just like you, which cannot 
be said for gay men in a racial 
or other social minority. There 
are always exceptions; however, 
go to Pride Night at Necto 
Nightclub any Friday and take a 
peek at the racial demographics.

White gay men are seen 

as the “typical” gay man and 
“typical” LGBTQ person, so 
we have the power to represent 
the rest of the communities. 
It’s such a shame that we’ve 
decided to use our privilege 
to bolster ourselves and put 
our political needs first at the 
expense of everyone else, both 
in terms of the selectivity of 
the types of gay men and in 
terms of political sway.

White men have corrupted 

LGBT Pride from a symbol 
of empowered solidarity and 
celebration of sexual difference 
to a vehicle that transmits 
a false sense of unity in the 
LGBT communities. In other 
words, our whiteness, maleness 
and overall gender conformity 
bequeathed us the mic under 
the assumption that we would 
speak for everyone and we 
have consistently abused that 
privilege. Pride has become 
a hollow symbol that only 
represents white gay men’s 
voices, not all colors of the 
rainbow as we like to think.

It’s for these reasons that I 

hesitate to identify as gay. As a 
white man, that term has a lot 
of baggage from which I would 
like to dissociate. I’d rather be 
a normal guy who likes guys. 
A “normal guy” — but not a 
“normal gay.”

A 
“normal 
gay” 
accepts 

the conflation of the terms 
“LGBT community” with “gay 
community,” 
which 
erases 

identities 
and 
orients 
the 

broader 
queer 
community 

toward strictly male concerns. 
A 
“normal 
gay” 
conforms 

to and reproduces the toxic 
masculinity that elevated their 
position in the LGBT food 
chain, 
perpetuating 
sexism, 

racism and all other social 
hierarchies. A “normal gay,” in 
other words, puts themselves 
first and holds back the rest of 
the LGBT community. 

I challenge white gay men 

of any and all types to get over 
our racist, sexist, cissexist, 
hateful demons. Society and 
socialization in our corrupted 
gay circles have taught to be this 
way. It’s not our fault; however, 
it is still our responsibility to 
recognize your shortcomings 
and fight them. It is only by 
embracing the LBTQ of LGBTQ 
that we can make Pride what it 
was meant to be: a way to build 
an inclusive queer community, 
to use our privileges as white 
men to elevate unheard voices 
and to celebrate our community 
of differences in all their forms. 

Who knows? Maybe that 

will make the inherently white 
“normal gay” palatable again.

I’m not gay, I’m normal

James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem singing his little heart out
LCD returns with other-
wordly ‘american dream’

LCD Soundsystem’s first album since their reunion doesn’t 
disappoint with Murphy contemplating love, loss and age

The 
greatest 
tragedy, 

it would seem, is to waste 
your youth. To fail to live 
with urgency, to stay home, 
sober, alone. I, in the middle 
of my youth, feel the tug of 
expectation acutely, the push 
to model my life on the pictures 
of youth I see in movies and 
hear in pop songs.

James Murphy, whose youth 

was behind him before he ever 
made music with a band called 
LCD Soundsystem, calls those 
pictures of youth what they 
are: lies. But lies he still finds 
himself falling for.

Time — and its inextricable 

relationship with age — is at 
the heart of american dream, 
LCD 
Soundsystem’s 
first 

album since their calculated 
2011 “break-up.” Murphy, now 
47, wades through the debris 
of middle age — lost love, dead 
friends, unactualized dreams—
on an album that is at once 
textbook LCD Soundsystem 
and 
something 
completely 

new.

Both LCD Soundsystem and 

the world they make music in 
are different beasts than they 
were when the band bid us 
all farewell for the first time 
in 2011. And to those who are 
caught up in the betrayal of a 
band they love getting back 
together I say: 
So 
what? 
I’d 

want to hear 
the complaints 
if this album 
felt 
like 
a 

rushed 
post-

script. But it 
doesn’t. 
With 

american 
dream, 
LCD 

Soundsystem 
doesn’t 
want 

to rewrite their 
past, but rather 
make sense of 
their 
present. 

Sometimes, the 
only way you 
can make sense 
of a world on 
the 
brink 
of 

collapse is to 
make art about 
it. Sometimes, 
that 
means 

getting 
the 

band 
back 

together.

Seven 

years 
later, 

we’re still dealing with the 
manic, meticulous brain of 
the singular, ineffable James 
Murphy. “tonite,” the album’s 
third single and centerpiece, is 
sonically the most reminiscent 
of the band’s earlier albums. 
With its synthy, repetitive beat 
and cheeky yet earnest lyrics, 
it’s peak LCD Soundsystem. 
But, like the rest of the album, 

it’s more vulnerable and darker 
than we’ve ever seen them.

Ever anxious, Murphy is 

increasingly 
self-aware. 
As 

much as he laments the modern 
world, he calls himself out 
for that — “Oh good gracious 
/ I sound like my mom,” he 
quips. And, who exactly is 
he addressing when he sings: 
“You’re missing a party that 
you’ll never get over / You hate 
the idea that you’re wasting 
your youth”? It feels like he’s 
talking to me and 
also to himself.

Because, 
like 

its 
creators, 

american 
dream 

refuses 
to 
be 

any 
one 
thing. 

It’s art rock and 
disco-punk 
and 

electronica. 
It’s 

post-swan 
song. 

It’s 
a 
rebirth 

that’s obsessed with death, 
a beginning comprised of a 
series of endings.

Murphy is, as he describes 

himself in the song, “the 
hobbled veteran of the disk 
shop 
inquisition.” 
He’s 
a 

reminder of some bygone era 
when manic music fandom 
took up physical space. On the 
album, he clings to the vestiges 
of something else millennials 
allegedly killed. But he doesn’t 
seem to blame the younger 
generation for their murderous 
evolution of the industry.

That 
being 

said, american 
dream 
has 
a 

weight 
to 
it 

that other LCD 
Soundsystem 
albums 
don’t. 

The 
cultural 

and 
musical 

references feel 
like 
eulogies 

for a time and 
a 
sound 
that 

doesn’t 
quite 

exist anymore. 
And Murphy’s 
major 
sonic 

influences 
— 
Lou 
Reed, 

David 
Bowie, 

Leonard Cohen 
— have all died 
in 
the 
years 

since the band’s 
last album. On 
the 
album’s 

final 
track, 

“black screen,” 
Murphy 
eulogizes 
Bowie 
and 

laments 
his 
own 
inability 

to pinpoint his late friend’s 
location in the cosmos, the 
“black screen” of outer space.

Bowie is all over american 

dream. Murphy creates an 
otherworldly sound similar to 
that of the “Berlin Trilogy.” 
“oh baby,” the album’s opener, 
floats 
dreamy 
and 
hazy, 

signaling from its first notes 

that american dream inhabits 
a space far above the earth. 
And for the most part, the 
album stays there, hovering 
high in the sky, until the long 
comedown at the end of “black 
screen” floats it back down.

With its pared down poetry 

and repetitive word choice, “oh 
baby” is lyrically classic James 
Murphy. But it starts the album 
in a more melancholic place 
than we’ve seen him really 
go before. While american 

dream 
rides 

an 
emotional 

rollercoaster 
from 
anger 
to 

grief 
to 
brief 

moments of joy, 
melancholy is the 
real 
emotional 

backbone. 
There’s 
sadness 

in the sting of 
lines like: “I must 

admit: I miss the laughing / But 
not so much you” from “how 
do you sleep?” a song about 
Murphy’s 
falling 
out 
with 

former friend and business 
partner.

And, 
halfway 
through 

2017, what is more bitterly 
melancholic than the American 
Dream? And specifically the 
one Murphy paints on the 
album’s titular track. Murphy 
is old, a little tired, but still 
performing a type of youth 
rooted in the disappearing 
culture of the early 2000’s New 
York rock scene in which the 
band was born and nurtured. 
Murphy pokes fun at failed 
revolutions, his own age and 
the unbearable weight of the 
modern world. It’s heavy, but 
buoyed by a sparkling synthy 
sound and airy vocals, and the 
faintest spark of hope.

Such goes much of the 

album. Darkness sounds like 
light and sadness sounds like 
something akin to joy. It’s 
Murphy doing what he does 
best — ten or twelve things at 
once — both in production (his 
credits on the album include 
producer, 
writer, 
vocals, 

guitar, synth, bass guitar, 
drums, bongos, glockenspiel 
and mixing to name a few) and 
substance.

And it’s this ability to do 

so much with so little that 
makes Murphy’s music so 
powerful. His music makes me 
feel known, seen, understood, 
despite 
our 
circumstantial 

differences. 
I 
feel 
old 

sometimes, although I know I 
am not — too old to be young 
and too young to be old. I feel 
confused and left out and left 
behind by a world that seems 
to be spiraling out of control. 
american dream transcends 
delineations of age or race or 
gender because what it gets at, 
above all else, is the fact that, 
at the end of the day, we’re all 
just stuck moving forward in 
time.

ALBUM REVIEW

“Patti Cake$” is an underdog story at heart
New ‘Patti Cake$’ gets 
by on heart and hip hop

The film chronicles the story of a poor, struggling Patti 
and her efforts to become a hip hop star despite her roots

It’s probably safe to say that 

“Patti Cake$” won’t be the most 
original movie anyone sees this 
year. It owes far too much of its 
story, themes and characters 
to “8 Mile” and other similar 
underdog stories for that to 
be true. It also won’t win any 
awards for unpredictability. 
From scene one, the ending 
and the path the script will 
take there are plainly obvious. 
What sets “Patti Cake$” apart 
from other movies of its type is 
its heart and just how genuine 
it feels. It’s a movie where it’s 
impossible not to feel for and 
root for its atypical cast of 
aspiring rap artists. It’s not 
perfect by any 
stretch of the 
imagination, 
but the movie 
is every bit as 
earnest as its 
unceasingly 
lovable leads.

The 

main 
story 

follows 
Patti 

Dombrowski 
(Danielle 
MacDonald, 
“Every 
Secret 

Thing”), a plus-
sized 
white 

woman 
living 

in New Jersey 
who 
dreams 

of becoming a 
rapper. Between 
dealing 
with 

her 
overbearing, 
alcoholic 

mother 
(Bridget 
Everett, 

“Trainwreck”) 
and 
caring 

for 
her 
wheelchair-bound 

grandmother (Cathy Moriarty, 
“The Double”), she writes her 
own music and plans to record 
it with her best friend, Jheri 

(Siddharth Dhanajay in his 
feature debut), in the hopes of 
escaping her impoverished life.

Again, 
the 
lifeblood 
of 

“Patti Cake$” is the main cast. 
MacDonald is endearing from 
the start as Patti (known by 
the 
moniker 

“Killa 
P”), 
a 

character 
with 

big dreams and 
the guts to reach 
for them, even 
as 
everything 

around her seems 
to be telling her 
to stop. Like the best underdog 
performances, 
MacDonald 

layers the optimism with an 
underlying tragedy, and Patti is 
more realistic – and therefore 
relatable – for it. It’s Everett, 
however, who ends up being 

the highlight as 
Patti’s 
mother, 

Barb, 
who 

once 
shared 

her 
daughter’s 

dream of making 
it 
big 
in 
the 

music 
industry. 

Playing 
Barb 

with a mixture 
of 
brokenness, 

cruelty and real 
love, 
Everett 

creates 
a 

character whose 
relationship with 
her 
daughter 

may 
rank 
as 

one of the best 
and 
ultimately 

rewarding of its 
kind this year.

As is befitting 

a movie that is, at least in 
part, a musical, the songs 
are fantastic. If nothing else, 
audiences should walk away 
from “Patti Cake$” with an 
appreciation for just what a 
talented 
rapper 
MacDonald 

is. All of the best scenes of 

the movie are built around 
the music, whether it’s the 
first recording session where 
Patti, Jheri and Patti’s scene-
stealing 
grandmother 
team 

up with reclusive anarchist 
Basterd 
(Mamadou 
Athie, 

“The Get Down”) 
to produce their 
first track “PBNJ” 
or the emotional, 
energetic 
finale. 

The film may well 
be worth seeing 
for the soundtrack 
alone.

Unfortunately, without the 

music it occasionally feels like 
the movie lacks a backbone or 
glue to hold the whole thing 
together. The editing loses its 
sense of rhythm, particularly 
during overcut dialogue scenes, 
and the cinematography — 
which trades in psychedelic 
rap 
video 
imagery 
at 
the 

best of times — tends to go 
for the increasingly popular 
“Moonlight” look. Many scenes 
are shot in handheld, shallow 
focus close-ups in an attempt 
to mimic the gorgeous, Oscar-
nominated cinematography of 
last year’s Best Picture winner, 
but as in many other movies, 
it’s 
more 
distracting 
here 

than anything else. It’s hard 
to feel for what’s happening 
onscreen when there are times 
you can barely tell what you’re 
supposed to be looking at.

Still, 
“Patti 
Cake$” 
is 

charming enough — both on 
the basis of its leads and its 
music — that it should be seen. 
It is a movie that has been done 
before and will undoubtedly 
be 
done 
again, 
but 
what 

problems it has are more than 
outweighed by the care and 
love that went into crafting 
this particular story. Other 
underdog movies should take 
note.

ALBUM REVIEW

ATLANTIC RECORDS

The War on Drugs return with another stunner
War on Drugs make sense 
of the world on new album
War on Drugs’ latest album shows the band’s move from 
heavy reliance on influences to more natural and meaningful

Authenticity 
is 
more 

important 
than 
originality. 

Yet, we value the latter more 
and lampoon music that sounds 
obviously derivative of other 
artists. Ripping someone off 
is pathetic — something that 
can be a hefty lawsuit — but 
incorporating 
elements 
of 

other artists is the driving force 
behind 
artistic 
progression. 

Nothing 
is 
every 
purely 

authentic: The War on Drugs, a 
band that wears its influences 
on its sleeve, embraces this 
wholeheartedly. 

Especially at the beginning 

of 
careers, 
most 
great 

bands 
sound 
like 
someone 

else before they fully grow 
into 
their 
distinct 
sound. 

Radiohead initially had a pretty 
straightforward britpop style 
before OK Computer shattered 
everyone’s expectations of rock 
music. Pink Floyd emerged in 

the late ’60s as just another 
Psychedelic Rock band oozing 
with whimsicality and dripping 
with 
LSD 
before 
releasing 

prog-rock masterpieces Meddle 
and The Dark Side 
of the Moon. The 
War 
on 
Drugs 

began as one big 
love letter to Bob 
Dylan, and since 
then, everyone is 
quick to point this 
out, along with 
similarities 
to 

Bruce Springsteen 
and 
other 
’80s 
heartland 

rockers.

By now, the comparisons 

have 
grown 
old. 
Even 

though 
Adam 
Granduciel, 

the 
band’s 
frontman 
and 

creative powerhouse, doesn’t 
shy away from allowing his 
influences to shine through, no 
contemporary musician sounds 
anything like them, not even 
his past collaborator Kurt Vile. 
Granduciel’s 
combination 
of 

pulsating synths and guitar 
hooks layered with effects has 
become a unique trademark 
in contemporary music. With 
their fourth album, A Deeper 

Understanding, 
The 
War 
on 

Drugs 
has 

proven 
that 

they’re capable 
of 
producing 

authentic 
work 
without 

the 
restraint 

of 
sounding 

completely 

original.

In 
2014, 
Lost 
in 
the 

Dream 
shocked 
thousands 

and became, arguably, the 
most beloved rock album of 
the year. Granduciel takes 
listeners from the bleakest 
depths of depression and 
heartbreak 
— 
songs 
like 

“Under the Pressure” and 
“Disappearing” 
— 
to 
the 

relieving 
feeling 
after 

conquering 
your 
crushing 

anxiety — like the freeing 
melodies of “Eyes to the 
Wind” and the energetic 
optimism 
of 
“Burning.” 

Every 
emotion 
tied 
to 

heartbreak 
is 
present. 

It’s a breakup album that 
questions love and the pain 
it causes, and what it means 
to grow as a person.

A Deeper Understanding, 

a 
deceiving 
name, 
sees 

Granduciel still looking for 
answers to these questions 
in 
his 
pursuit 
of 
self 

growth. Despite a plethora 
of success following Lost in 
the Dream — signing onto 
Atlantic Records, entering 
a relationship with Krysten 
Ritter (“Jessica Jones”) and 
deserved critical acclaim — 
Granduciel is still struggling 
to resolve his own pitfalls 
and anxieties. “I’ve been 
through it / I always have 
paranoia that I would not 
last” Granduciel sings on 
the opening track “Up All 
Night,” a jittery yet upbeat 
song 
that 
progressively 

builds layer upon layer of 
drums and synths. It’s clear 
from the beginning that A 
Deeper Understanding is by 
no means a resolution album 
where 
Granduciel 
cures 

himself of the same feelings 
of loneliness evident on Lost 
in the Dream.

The band released five 

singles 
anticipating 
the 

album’s release, and with 
each one, it became clear the 
album wouldn’t disappoint. 
“Thinking of a Place,” a 
sprawling 
11-minute 
epic 

released earlier in April 
for Record Store Day, was

It’s impossible not to fall 
in love with “Consolation”

Ford’s recent novel explores the intricacies of love in a 
challenging environment with a bittersweet, if quick, end

I don’t think I’ve ever read a 

book that had everything I was 
looking for and more until I 
read Jamie Ford’s newest novel 
“Love and Other Consolation 
Prizes.” I laughed, I cried, I 
hoped for it to never end and 
I circled some of the most 
endearing paragraphs in red 
ink so many times that I nearly 
put a tear in the page.

Ford’s 
story 

follows 
Ernest 

Young, a 12 year 
old half-Chinese 
boy entranced by 
the 1909 World’s 
Fair in Seattle. 
After surviving a 
terrifying month 
on an immigrant 
ship from Asia, 
Ernest lives as a 
charity student at a boarding 
school where the treatment is 
nearly as harsh as on the ship. 
The opportunity to attend the 
fair seems nothing short of a 
dream, until he realizes that he 
is the prize and will be raffled 
off as a servant to the highest 
bidder at the fair. Ernest is 
raffled off to the madam of a 
high class brothel where his 
life changes forever when he 
meets the precocious young 
daughter of the madam — the 
fiery scullery maid, Fahn. For 

the first time in his life, Ernest 
feels as though he has a family, 
and has found himself a real 
home. There is an immediate 
sense of comfort between the 
residents of the brothel and 
Ernest thus making him feel 
incredibly comfortable. 

Fifty years later, in the dark 

shadow of the second World’s 
Fair, Ernest struggles to bring 
his ailing wife, who is suffering 
from dementia and illness, 

back to the woman she once 
was. He constantly avoids the 
memories of his childhood and 
keeps his family secrets hidden 
from his grown up daughters.

The 
story 
jumps 
from 

Ernest’s 
tumultuous 
albeit 

adventurous 
past 
to 
his 

dragging and difficult present, 
creating 
a 
relationship 

between the two worlds, as 
Ernest’s family, and he himself, 
discover who he really is.

The 
story 
of 
Ernest’s 

childhood 
is 
interesting 

and historical, feeling just 

enough like an 
anachronism 
that 1909 should. 
The 
culture 

of 
the 
brothel, 

matched with the 
descriptions 
of 

their progressive 
and 
cultural 

outside 
world 

fits 
the 
time 

period perfectly. 

The detail included in the 
descriptions of the house and 
the lifestyle of the brothel is 
magically compelling in a way 
that makes the book impossible 
to put down.

The early 1900s juxtaposes 

with the early 1960s in the most 
wonderful way, making for a 
comfortable switch between 
time periods. It is between 
these two time periods that 
the reader can understand 
Ernest as not just a character 
in a book, but as the imaginary 
manifestation of real struggles 
and issues that many people 
can relate to.

The story is told in prose 

that spends generous time 
describing the setting and 
characters, making both seem 
incredibly real. The reader 
falls just as in love with the 
two strong female characters 
as Ernest does, is incredibly 
entranced by the bossy Madam 
and her swirl of anxiety and 
depression 
and 
becomes 

charmed by the brothel’s kind 
and witty piano player. There 
is something endearing about 
being placed in the heart 
of Ernest’s struggle in the 
beginning of the story, sailing 
to America right beside him 
and falling in love right when 
he does.

The 
novel 
is 
truly 
an 

exceptional piece of fiction. 
It’s a family story that largely 
surrounds the nature of love; 
however, it is also dangerous, 
promiscuous, 
sweet, 
naive 

and intelligent. All of these 
things at once make for an 
intoxicating 
yet 
pleasant 

literary cocktail.

My only wish was that it was 

longer. I could have lingered in 

the streets of Seattle below a 
large looming Ferris Wheel, in 
the kitchen with Fahn or in a 
restaurant booth with Ernest’s 
wife for much longer than I did 

in the pages I held in my hands.

Ultimately, it inspired me to 

read more of Ford’s work and to 
invest in more Asian-American 
literature about the lives of 
Asian Americans. I only hope 
people gravitate toward this 
paperback in the future, and 
fall in love with it as quickly as 
I did.

were all in top form. Although 
dense and long, “Thinking of a 
Place” is one of the band’s most 
conventional rock songs with 
one of the best guitar solos 
in recent memory. The song 
embodies the imagery of a self 
reflective road trip through 
the 
American 
countryside 

(truth be told, most of their 
music embodies this cliché).

The War on Drugs packs the 

most weight into “Strangest 
Thing,” 
which 
became 
an 

instant classic among their 
stacked 
catalog. 
The 
song 

breaks 
down 
halfway 
into 

an explosion of synths and a 
guitar solo, each instrument 
complementing 
the 
other 

as if they’re part of a world 
class 
symphony. 
Following 

this is “Knocked Down,” a 
ballad, rare for the band, that 
favors piano over guitar. It’s 
their 
most 
stripped 
down 

and 
resembles 
“Suffering,” 

though it ultimately fails to 
dethrone its Lost in the Dream 
counterpart.

Unlike 
past 
records, 
A 

Deeper Understanding departs 

from a more atmospheric sound 
in favor of more conventional 
rock 
qualities. 
The 
closest 

Granduciel gets to this ambient 
style is on the closing track, 
“You Don’t Have to Go.” But 
even here, its light, ethereal 

feeling is achieved without 
sacrificing a straightforward 
structure, using harmonicas 
and real instruments to create 
such a lush sound. Its nearly 
seven minute length feels much 
shorter — at no point do their 
songs drag and feel longer than 
a more traditional three-and-a-

half minute pop song.

The closest they get to 

producing another “Red Eyes,” 
the most successful single from 
Lost in the Dream, is “Holding 
On.” It opens with a fast paced 
synth hook, then leads into 
piercing guitars. Every aspect 
about it, from the vocals to 
the catchy Springsteen-esque 
chimes, makes for an accessible 
jam that, if maybe a minute or 
two shorter, could very well be 
a smash hit. But it’s “Nothing to 
Find,” an exhilarating heater 
of a song, that sticks out as the 
most vibrant. Essentially, this 
is the song a dad would play to 
pump up his son before a Little 
League baseball game.

A 
Deeper 
Understanding 

isn’t necessarily a better album 
than Lost in the Dream, but it 
doesn’t have to be. It’s one more 
milestone for Granduciel in his 
attempt to make meaning of 
the world around him. He has 
managed to gain popularity 
making music that is by no 
means the most popular style 
of today, a testament to his 
masterful 
musicianship. 
In 

times of joy and times of misery, 
The War on Drugs once again 
delivers an album to cope with 
the emotions we can’t ignore, 
the feelings of falling in and out 
of love and the harrowing self-
doubt we face.

The reader falls 

just as in love with 

the two strong 

female characters 

as Ernest does, 
and is incredibly 
entranced by the 

bossy Madam 
and her swirl 
of anxiety and 

depression

A Deeper 

Understanding 

isn’t necessarily a 
better album than 
Lost in the Dream, 
but it doesn’t have 

to be

Michigan moves up to 
No. 8 in AP rankings 

After 
a 
dominant 
33-17 

win over then-No. 17 Florida 
last weekend, the Michigan 
football team jumped into the 
top-10 rankings this week. 

The Wolverines (1-0) came 

in at No. 8 in both the AP 
Top 25 and the Coaches’ Poll. 
Michigan moved up three 
spots from its position at No. 
11.

The 
last 
time 
the 

Wolverines were ranked in 
the top 10 was 
prior 
to 
the 

2016 
Orange 

Bowl in Miami. 
At 
the 
time, 

they 
were 

ranked No. 6, 
but lost to the 
11th-ranked 
Seminoles, 
33-32.

Saturday, the 

Wolverines’ 
young 
and 
relentless 

defense held the Gators to 
just 11 rushing yards, while 
Michigan’s 
offense 
was 

boosted by fifth-year senior 
running back Ty Isaac (114 
rushing yards, 11 carries) and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
kicker 

Quinn Nordin (four made field 
goals).

With 
the 
uninspiring 

performance, Florida dropped 
down to 22nd and 24th in the 
AP rankings and Coaches’ 
Poll, respectfully.

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh lauded sophomore 
linebacker Devin Bush (seven 
tackles, two sacks) on Monday 
for 
his 
impressive 
outing 

against 
the 
Gators. 
Bush, 

along with the other defensive 
players, kept both of Florida’s 
offense in check.

Michigan’s 
upcoming 

opponent, Cincinnati, defeated 
Austin 
Peay 
(Clarksville, 

Tenn.) by a score of 26-14 in 
its opener. Still, the Bearcats 
aren’t expected to impose 
nearly as much of a threat as 
Florida, as the Wolverines 
are a 34-point favorite in the 
matchup.

National outlook
The 
Wolverines 
jumped 

ahead of Big Ten foe Wisconsin 
(1-0), which stayed put at No. 
9 after crushing Utah State, 
59-10. The Big Ten now has 
four teams in the AP top-10 

— No. 2 Ohio 
State and No. 4 
Penn State are 
the others — 
the most of any 
conference.

Michigan 

jumped 
into 

the 
top 
10 

after 
Florida 

State 
(0-1) 

suffered a 24-7 
loss 
against 

top-ranked 
Alabama. 
The 

now 10th-ranked Seminoles 
suffered 
a 
much 
more 

significant loss though, when 
quarterback Deondre Francois 
went down with a season-
ending injury.

The Crimson Tide have 

their sights set on returning 
to the College Football Playoff 
after losing to Clemson in 
the championship game last 
season.

Despite 
a 
handful 
of 

marquee 
opening-weekend 

matchups, the second week 
of college football isn’t short 
of 
excitement. 
Four 
top-

25 matchups will be played 
this weekend. No. 3 Clemson 
hosts No. 13 Auburn, No. 6 
Southern 
California 
hosts 

No. 14 Stanford and No. 15 
Georgia visits No. 24 Notre 
Dame. 

Kemp embracing backup role on D-line

Michigan redshirt sophomore 

defensive 
end 
Carlo 
Kemp 

comes from a “tough-love” kind 
of family. One of his uncles, 
Chuck Pagano, is the head coach 
for the Indianapolis Colts, and 
his other uncle, John Pagano, 
is a defensive assistant for the 
Oakland Raiders. 

Football flows deep in the 

Pagano family blood — and the 
Kemp family by extension — 
and when asked about the best 
advice he has ever received 
from his two uncles, Kemp 
laughed.

“They said they would not 

draft me,” Kemp chuckled. “I’m 
always working to hopefully 
change their minds one day.”

That day may not arrive just 

yet, but after redshirting his 
first year at Michigan, Kemp is 
confident he’s making strides 
in his game. Kemp arrived as 
an early enrollee prior to his 
freshman year and has now had 
over a year under his belt of 
lifting and learning how to play 
in Michigan’s defense.

He 
also 
has 
had 
the 

opportunity 
to 
go 
through 

spring 
practice 
twice, 
and 

feels that it has been very 
beneficial 
in 
boosting 
his 

overall technique and approach 
to the game, both mentally and 
physically.

Last year, Michigan defensive 

coordinator 
Don 
Brown 

admitted 
that 
he 
would’ve 

traded away Kemp for as little 
as two used footballs, but a lot 
has changed since then.

“Getting those two spring 

(camps) in for me really helped 
because that’s a lot of learning 
and a lot of coaching,” Kemp 
said. 
“Getting 
that 
second 

camp in leading up to Florida 
was really beneficial for my 
personal growth.”

Now working his way into 

the starting lineup is one of 
Kemp’s main goals. But with 
such a stacked defensive line, 
he understands that his ability 
to provide relief for the starters 
is just as important.

Kemp is fully embracing his 

role backing up sophomore 
defensive end Rashan Gary, 
one of Michigan’s standout 

defensive players this year.

“Depth is big for us,” Kemp 

said. “You want to make sure 
that when the starters come 
out, they feel confident that the 
person that’s going in behind 
them is going to succeed and 
do what we’re supposed to do 
on the field. For me, I know 
that when Rashan comes out, 
I want him to 
feel like he can 
go and get his 
breather.

“That 
way, 

when he goes 
back in, he can 
do what we all 
know 
that 
he 

can do at the 
highest 
level, 

without 
being 

exhausted 
because he has to play the 
whole game.”

In Kemp’s eyes, Gary has 

developed into a leader on 
the defensive line. Gary, the 
former top-ranked recruit in 
the nation for his class, was 
credited with two tackles and 
a quarterback hurry against 
Florida. 
Whenever 
Gary 

makes a play, whether it is in 
practice or in the game, Kemp 
is watching.

Kemp’s admiration for him 

goes beyond Gary’s physical 
talent 
and 
includes 
his 

knowledge of the game.

“Personally I look up to 

him a lot because he knows 
a lot about the game,” Kemp 

said. 
“If 
you 

wouldn’t 
take 

his 
coaching 

or watch what 
he does when 
he’s in, it would 
be 
pointless. 

I’m 
always 

watching 
him, 

and he’s always 
got really good 
advice for me. 
I just try to 

follow his example.”

Now that Gary’s starting 

on the D-line, Kemp will have 
plenty of opportunities to watch 
his teammate. Kemp subbed in 
for Gary on a handful of plays 
against Florida last weekend — 
enough to earn his first career 
tackle.

Kemp has been able to work 

his way into a stacked defensive 
line rotation, despite playing 
with a broken hand.

During a scrum with redshirt 

junior 
offensive 
lineman 

Juwann Bushell-Beatty, Kemp 
got his hand caught in Bushell-
Beatty’s shoulder pads on a pass 
rush. Kemp came out of the play 
with a broken hand in the first 
week of fall camp, but it didn’t 
stop him from playing.

He wore a big “club” cast, as 

he described it, that covered his 
entire right hand. He has since 
been upgraded to a cast that 
allows him to move his fingers 
around.

“I used to have the club,” 

Kemp said. “I just had a left 
hand, but now with my fingers 
I can grab stuff now.

“Grab stuff… grab people... 

grab whatever.”

His two NFL coaches-for-

uncles surely wouldn’t let him 
use a broken hand as an excuse, 
and Kemp won’t let it derail his 
efforts on the D-line either.

Peoples-Jones fearless at punt returner

As far as freshman debuts go, 

Donovan Peoples-Jones’ was 
fairly impressive. 

The 
first-year 
receiver 

started at punt returner for 
Michigan, returning five punts 
for 40 yards in his team’s 
33-17 victory over Florida. And 
while the total yardage may 
not seem like much, that was 
in part due to Florida’s special 
team coverage and the efforts 
of 
Johnny 
Townsend, 
who 

averaged 54.7 yards per punt 
with excellent hang time.

Nonetheless, Peoples-Jones 

displayed 
the 
athleticism 

that made him such a highly-
touted prospect out of high 
school. He fielded every punt 
he saw, never calling for a fair 
catch despite Florida’s special 
teamers barrelling down upon 
him. Each time he touched the 
ball, he was seemingly one or 
two broken tackles away from 
breaking a long return.

The freshman, though, was 

much more measured about his 
performance.

“I think I played okay,” 

Peoples-Jones 
said 
Tuesday. 

“There’s 
always 
room 
for 

improvement, and with this 
team, the amount of talent that 
we have, I think the sky’s the 
limit.”

His head coach offered praise 

following the game — with one 
caveat.

“Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 

(was) very good on the punt 
return,” said Jim Harbaugh. 
“Gotta get that ball a little 
tighter, better ball security.”

Peoples-Jones 
agreed. 
In 

his mind, “ball security equals 
job security.” That won’t affect 
how 
he 
decides 
to 
return 

punts, though. He sees his 
responsibility as giving the 
offense good field position, and 
if that means risking a big hit to 
field a punt, so be it.

“As a punt returner, you’ve 

got to kind of be relentless and 
fearless back there,” Peoples-
Jones said. “Anything that I can 
do for this team to help them 
win, I’m going to do it.”

While 
Peoples-Jones 
said 

that he was “really excited” for 
the opportunity 
to return punts, 
it’s likely he’s 
hoping 
for 

more 
snaps 

at 
receiver 

after 
arriving 

on campus as 
the 
nation’s 

top-ranked 
recruit at the 
position 
and 

the crown jewel 
of 
Michigan’s 

2017 recruiting class.

There 
doesn’t 
appear 
to 

be 
any 
consternation 
from 

Peoples-Jones on the lack of 
receiving targets, though. The 
coaches have a plan for him, 
and he trusts that plan.

Peoples-Jones 
— 
who 

enrolled early — has also had 
the benefit of help from an 
unexpected 
source: 
redshirt 

junior 
quarterback 
Wilton 

Speight.

The two were roommates 

in fall camp, and the veteran 

starting 
quarterback 
appears 
to 

have taken the 
freshman under 
his wing.

“It was great 

chemistry,” 
Peoples-Jones 
said. “... Every 
night we were 
together talking, 
just 
learning 

(about) the type 

of person (Speight) is. Him 
meeting me, just being around 
each other, helped a lot.

“He’s a great person. He’s 

one of my newer friends, and I 
like him a lot. … It can benefit 
me a lot. Questions that I might 
not be comfortable with asking 

the coaches, things that he 
knows that the coaches don’t 
know I can ask him, or we can 
have a connection there.”

While freshman receivers 

have typically had difficulty 
making an impact at Michigan 
— Mario Manningham set the 
record for most receiving yards 
with a relatively modest 433-
yard campaign his freshman 
year 
— 
Peoples-Jones 
does 

appear well-equipped to pick 
up the mental aspects of the 
game.

After all, it can’t be much 

harder than his class load.

“In the spring, I had a wide 

load of classes — calculus and 
physics — so it’s not much more 
than that,” Peoples-Jones said.

For now, there isn’t much 

calculus to do when he’s on the 
field. Peoples-Jones was blunt 
when asked about what was 
going through his mind while 
taking his first punt.

“I wanted to score,” Peoples-

Jones said.

New formation a success in first trial against the Gators

On Saturday against then-

No. 
17 
Florida, 
Michigan 

defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown showcased yet another 
wrinkle to his blitz-heavy 
defense.

The 
new 
scheme 

incorporated a 3-3-5 stack, 
which, 
as 
redshirt 
junior 

defensive end Chase Winovich 
explained, involved moving 
the eighth-ranked Wolverines’ 
SAM linebacker to defensive 
end. In doing so, Michigan 
had the flexibility to add a 
linebacker to the box while 
putting a VIPER on the field 
as well.

Winovich 
added 
that 

the 
new 
formation 
allows 

the 
linebackers 
to 
blitz 

while 
deceiving 
opposing 

quarterbacks with the guise of 

their standard 4-3. And if the 
Gators’ offensive performance 
was 
any 
indication, 
the 

Wolverines weren’t easy to 
figure out. 

“When we unveiled it, I 

think they were just like, ‘Oh, 
crap, how do we adjust to this?’ 
” 
Winovich 
said 
Saturday 

night. “We had so many plays 
early on (in the) first half, 
Coach Brown said we have so 
many plays we haven’t even 
done yet, and we’re having a 
lot of success. And he said, 
let’s keep pushing.”

According 
to 
senior 

linebacker Noah Furbush, the 
inception of the new scheme 
all 
began 
during 
spring 

practices, 
as 
Brown 
was 

rotating a collection of players 
at different positions in an 
attempt to try to maximize 
everyone’s strengths.

And 
as 
it 
turned 
out, 

Furbush’s 
strengths 
were 

maximized 
at 
the 
SAM 

position of the new 3-3-5 
stack.

“I think it’s a lot of the same 

things I do at SAM,” Furbush 
said. “A lot of the principles 
carry over. But it’s definitely a 
new thing, it’s different having 
your hand in the dirt than just 
two feet on the ground.”

Originally, 
though, 

Michigan never intended to 
anchor its defense around 
the stack in its season opener. 
But with the success the 
formation 
yielded, 
there 

was no reason for Brown to 
deviate from it.

After all, the Wolverine 

defense 
recovered 
three 

fumbles — including one for a 
touchdown — while applying 
enough pocket pressure that 
Florida managed to register 
just 181 yards in the air. 
Perhaps 
most 
relevant 
of 

all, though, is that the new 
formation held the Gators to 
just 11 yards on the ground. 
By the end of the day, the 
Wolverines had registered six 
sacks and 11 tackles for loss. 

“The defense, the way they 

played, it was the best since 
I’ve been here coaching, that 
I’ve seen our defense run to the 
football,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. 
“Holes 
opened 

up 
and 
they 

closed. Pursuit. 
Nobody 
on 

the 
ground. 

Everybody 
(was) 
getting 

up 
running, 

making 
the 

tackle.”

As 
it 
turns 

out, 
one 
of 

those fumbles was the icing on 
the cake for Furbush and the 
Wolverines during the debut 
of their new defense.

With just over 90 seconds 

left in Saturday’s game, after 
Michigan had already chased 

Gators 
quarterback 
Feleipe 

Franks, Malik Zaire took the 
snap on 2nd and 18 in his own 
end zone. But Winovich burst 

through 
the 

line, 
forcing 

a 
fumble 

that 
Furbush 

promptly 
covered up for 
a 
touchdown, 

putting a nail 
in the Gators’ 
coffin.

“Don Brown 

had an excellent 
game 
plan,” 

Harbaugh said. 
“(He) 
worked 

one style of offense with the 
first quarterback that was 
in there. When they went to 
Malik Zaire, it changed. More 
read option and adapted the 
scheme.

“Our players knew it. They 

knew what they had with the 
one, and they knew what they 
had with the next. They were 
on it. Very happy. We were 
a 
confident 

unit, 
really 

well-coached 
defensive unit. 
We thought we 
were going to 
be 
good, 
and 

we were good. 
We’ll 
continue 

to build. I was 
really 
pleased 

with 
the 
way 

they ran to the 
ball.”

And 
while 

the 
Gators 
will 
be 
glad 

Michigan’s new-look unit is 
in the rearview mirror, there 
may be no one happier than 
the Wolverines’ own offensive 
unit. For the first time in a 
calendar year, they finally got 

to play someone else.

“We’ve seen it for so long 

now that — to me it’s more 
personnel, just because we’ve 

got 
a 
lot 
of 

guys 
that 
do 

a lot of things 
really 
well,” 

said 
fifth-year 

senior running 
back Ty Isaac 
on Monday. “I 
know when we 
first 
started 

seeing it, it was 
giving us fits, 
just 
because 

it’s hard to tell 
what’s 
coming 

from where.

“It turns into playing spots 

instead of body type. They’ve 
done a really good job of 
keeping (the) offense, at least 
us, off balance and obviously it 
worked against Florida.”

Empath in the Wild: The Sorry Rug

B

oth my father and mother have been 
working 
in 
Republican 
politics 
my 

entire life, but my political leanings fall 
pretty far to the left, due to a nebulous 

conglomeration of incidental factors. The contrast 
between the reddish hue of my family environments 
and the blueish one of my educational and extrafamilial 
social 
environments, 
along 
with, 
I 
think, 
my 

experiences having separated parents, have taught me 
to see both sides of things — or else suffer alienation 
from those dearest to me.

I spent eight years of my childhood attending a teeny 

tiny Montessori school, where the curriculum was as 
much academic as it was interpersonal. The Montessori 
approach to teaching and learning is loosely structured 
and individualized to each student. This, paired with 
my school’s fairly extensive financial aid program, 
meant that I was in classrooms with kids of different 
abilities, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and varying 
financial backgrounds as well.

In the classroom, I was socialized from a young 

age to see others not through these filters, but 
instead to see them as the multidimensional human 
beings they are. I didn’t have homework when I went 
there, and each time I had a disagreement with one of 
my peers, we had to sit across from each other on the 
“sorry rug,” accept one another’s apologies, and hand 
each other fake yellow roses.

There is an underlying message I learned from 

being surrounded for so much of my childhood by 
people who are different from me in more obvious and 
culturally determined ways than, say, another upper-
middle class white girl who lives in the suburbs. It’s 
a message of empathy. And since then, I’ve practiced 
and developed this skill so I can 
empathize with a wide variety of 
people, including my mostly affluent, 
mostly white, mostly conservative 
family members, and also my friends, 
family, acquaintances and strangers 
who are none of those things.

Empathy 
is 
a 
semi-social 
act. 

It begins by placing myself in the 
company of others, physically or 
virtually, say, via the internet, then 
thinking about it in solitude. Then my 
empathetic practice can (but doesn’t 
have to) influence my actions toward 
other people.

According to the Oxford English 

Dictionary, 
it’s 
“the 
power 
of 

projecting 
one’s 
personality 

into (and so fully comprehending) the object of 
contemplation.” So, empathy is a contemplative 
act, not dissimilar to some forms of meditation. Of 
course, the empath’s understanding of someone 
else’s point of view is subjective — More on this later.

And like meditation, empathizing takes practice. 

A hundred small empathetic thought-feelings for 
people who hold perspectives varying in magnitude 
of difference from my own can allow me to 
empathize with someone who holds a drastically 
different perspective — or even someone who hates 
me.

Throughout my life, I practiced empathy not only 

for people who are different from me in all of the 
ways my Montessori classmates were, but also for 
my close family members to whom, because of my 
educational and social environments, I had grown 
dissimilar.

In 
the 
intensely 
polarized 
sociopolitical 

environment of the 2016 presidential election, my 
tendencies as an empath had me lost. How can I 
see close friends with immigrant parents cry on the 
phone with their parents when the results of the 
election became clear, then turn to face my father, 
who voted red this time around?

Inner tensions like this one, the result of witnessing 

and coming to understand my friends’ and family 
members’ drastically different personal experiences, 
have challenged me to contemplate the bounds of 
empathy. There have been times when I’ve come 
to understand so deeply why someone might vote 
for Trump that my thoughts have sounded similar 
to those of an apologist. Because of the slippery 
slope from empathizing to making (un)ethical 

compromises, I’ve questioned whether continuing 
to develop my empathetic practice is a morally 
sustainable endeavor. After sustained reflection 
and numerous conversations with people of varying 
backgrounds, I’ve come to an understanding that, if 
practiced carefully, empathy is actually a necessity.

I’ve come to find similarities between how people 

talk about empathy and how people talk about beauty. 
I think empathy is beautiful, and as Elaine Scarry 
writes in, On Beauty and Being Just, beholding a 
beautiful thing can help to further justice in the world.

When one perceives something to be beautiful, 

it is because the object of beauty makes sense to its 
beholder. When I empathize with someone, their 
perspective feels valid to me; it makes sense to me, 
even if only for a brief period of time. According to 
Scarry, beauty is fleeting, but for a moment it gives the 
beholder a sense of conviction.

At the same time, perceiving a beautiful thing also 

confronts me with my own capacity to make errors 
in judgment. Something I didn’t think was beautiful 
before appears beautiful to me now. Something that 
appeared beautiful before falls out of sense to me, pales 
in comparison to another more truly beautiful thing I 
behold.

Beauty prompts a search for that which is more 

beautiful. “It comes to us,” Scarry writes, “with no 
work of our own; then leaves us prepared to undergo 
a giant labor”. Beauty is a starting place for education, 
she argues. And if empathy is beautiful, then it, too, 
prompts a search for that which is more true, which 
makes more sense to me.

But if I’m constantly searching for things 

that make more sense to me, one can argue it 

follows that eventually the most 
beautiful thing will be my own 
perspective. But this is an erroneous 
counterargument. 
The 
more 
I 

practice empathy, the stretchier my 
empathetic imagination becomes. 
Empathy and reason converge when 
I understand the perspectives of 
oppressors but ultimately take the 
side of the oppressed.

If empathy is beautiful, I argue 

experiencing empathy is sacred — 
Something that has no precedent in 
my imaginative memory, something 
that puts me in awe, something that 
prompts me to consider my errors in 
judging this beauty, and something 
that ultimately acts as a vital force.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 6, 2017

DESIGN BY REGAN DETWILER


Wes Anderson never saw the beauty of 

elevated surfaces until now.

While we all see the grimy, loud and 

humid basement of a fraternity palace, 
Wes sees poetry in motion. Crystal 
Palace flows into a line of Dixie cups like a 
fresh water fountain in Rome. Hawaiian 
shirts and basketball jerseys float past a 
large, Insta-famous American flag with 
the grace and elegance of a bull in a china 
shop that’s drunk off Natty Lite and 
fragile masculinity. The sweat and heat 
of the dance floor knock you into a state 
of reverie.

But if I’m being honest, “Closer” for the 

87th time and early 2000s throwbacks do 
not fit into Wes Anderson’s filmmaking 
checklist.

Swap out the current fraternity DJ 

rotation with matching outfits from the 
’70s, pastel lighting and tunes from every 
decade except the one we’re in now — 
that’s the recipe.

I’ve sat at home and in many theaters 

watching 
Wes’s 
quirky, 
symmetrical 

set designs and smooth camera work 
for years now, but the music he lays 
underneath his scenes is the punctuation 
mark of his films. It guides the emotion 
and often exposes hidden truths. So who 
can stop Wes from turning the hallmark 
of the University of Michigan’s Welcome 
Week 
into 
a 
carefully 
orchestrated 

Anderson 
classic 
through 
a 
killer 

soundtrack? No one, that’s who.

Enter: Matt, 19, slim build (more lanky 

than slim, but this is my column so I can 
afford to boost my ego a little).

As I walk past three Greek letters and 

into the mansion, pushing past huge, 
bouncers the color of traffic cones, a 
jacked fella in a Knicks jersey sits in the 
living room. He looks me dead in the eyes 
as he strums his first, out-of-tune chord.

A Frat Brother Covering a Top 40 Hit 

on His Acoustic Guitar

If Wes can get away with recording 

a Seu Jorge cover of David Bowie in 
Portuguese 
for 
“The 
Life 
Aquatic,” 

why can’t Newest Pledge Ben or Chad 

or Whatever perform Post Malone’s 
“Congratulations” for a crowd of two or 
three people in line for the bathroom? 
He’s clearly the most talented in the 
room. He can even do Quavo’s part, so 
you know he’s cultured.

Anyway, Wes would want an authentic 

sound for the opening of his pièce de 
résistance. Even though the original is a 
little too recent for his tastes, the cover is 
in such a poor key and the brother’s vocal 
range is almost nonexistent. Thus, a new 
breed of soundtrack is born.

Well done, Wes. You always one-up 

yourself.

My eyes slowly readjust to the dim 

basement. My shoes stick to the floor as 
if it were still-wet cement. The camera 
pans to show a sea of bobbing heads, some 
higher than others on platforms forming 
waves. Love is in the air — battery-acid-
flavored vodka-induced love for sure, but 
love nonetheless.

“Let’s Spend the Night Together” — 

The Rolling Stones or David Bowie, take 
your pick.

If you want a British Invasion rocking 

and rolling undertone or if you’re going 
for a glam rock vibe, “Let’s Spend the 
Night Together” goes perfectly with the 
back-and-forth cycle of modern collegiate 
romance. 
A 
passionate, 
love-infused 

bond that rivals the sanctity of marriage, 
dancing at a frat party is the pinnacle 
display of affection we have here. Wes’s 
lens glides over the multitude of couples 
in slow motion 
with 
Bowie 
or 

Mick’s heavy-handed vocals moving us 
along with him. His attention to detail 
focuses on one couple and how invested 
the dude is in this modern waltz and 
how completely uninterested his female 
counterpart is in the whole ordeal, her 
eyes darting back and forth, looking for a 
way out.

“Now I need you more than ever….”
The 
elegantly 
concerned 
woman 

breaks away, rejecting the sleeveless-T-
clad bro’s poignant offer to “get out of 

here.” Loneliness ensues.

“Whiskey River” — Willie Nelson
Poor dude. He just wanted to treat this 

woman to a lovely burrito buffet and have 
some harmless fun. Who is she to reject 
him like that?

As he wanders toward the bar, ready 

to drown his sorrows, Willie Nelson’s 
country twang fades in. A honky-tonk 
instrumental marks this man’s lowest 
point, a truly inspiring soundtracking 
choice by Wes. A scene chock-full of 
resentment and male pride, Willie’s plea 
to not “let her memory torture me” really 
hits home for the movie patron. A real 
tear-jerker, if you ask me.

The heartbroken bro grabs a handle 

of Kamchatka for himself. If you had 
looked at him, you would have guessed 
the bottle was filled with water. He 
lies on the ground, perfectly lit in front 
of the aforementioned American flag, 
symbolizing his true conservative roots 
(nice touch, Wes). Tunnel vision starts to 
grip him as a subtle vignette effect fades 
onscreen. Blacking out is inevitable at 
this point.

“Death’s Black Train Is Coming” — 

Rev. J. M. Gates

“I want to sing a song and while I sing, 

I want every sinner in the house to come 
to the angel’s seat and bow…”

A minor callback to his work on 

“Fantastic Mr. Fox,” Wes selects an 
a cappella gospel tune to signal the 
collective mission of the people left 

at 
this 
party: 

blacking 
out. 

He masterfully turns a Lord’s song 
about preparing for the Devil to catch 
sinners into a completely new song 
about preparing for off-brand cranberry 
juice mixed with vodka to catch sinners. 
Beautiful, as always. Gates’ preaching 
fails to reach the mob as students crowd 
the bar. A flustered new pledge attempts 
to quench these intoxicated requests for 
vodka shots and chaser. As the inebriated 
run around him, the camera locks him 
into place, directly in the center of the 

frame. Another breathtaking shot for the 
books.

Just then, the reverend’s sermon is 

interrupted by the two words no one 
wants to hear coming from behind the 
bar. The last two words you hear before 
you dive into mass hysteria. Two words 
worse than “the horror” coming from 
Conrad’s pen:

“We’re dry!”
“Symphony No. 6 in D Major, Op. 60, 

B. 112, III. Scherzo: Presto” — Antonín 
Dvořák

Boom. A massive orchestra hits the 

crowd as couples break and everyone 
in the room makes a mad dash for 
alcohol. Wes’s montage speeds up the 
inebriated while keeping the guardians 
of the elixir stationary and stoic. As the 
camera moves behind the bar, looking 
out on the horde, we see clean-cut guys 
trying to barter with the bartenders 
for their “secret stash” of Kamchatka. 
Their failed attempts sync with the dark 
violin crescendos. The night can’t be 
over. It’s only 2 a.m. If you thought you 
could get through a Wes Anderson film 
without an orchestral selection, you’d 
better think otherwise. Dvořák’s drama 
marks the climax of our Greek cinematic 
experience.

The lights turn on. The DJ leaves his 

heavily-coveted post. Somehow, the 
room looks even worse when well-lit 
as opposed to brooding and dark. As 
the frat troopers file out one by one, a 
crackly acoustic guitar fades in.

“Dink’s Song” — Dave Van Ronk
“Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee 

well…”

A sentimental departure to say the 

least. There will never be a party like 
this again until next week’s “Beach 
Bums Blackout Banger.” Van Ronk 
supplies the music for the final shot of 
the humble frat abode exterior and for 
the following credits. ’Tis bittersweet 
but we shall all meet again at the huge 
rager in the sky or awkwardly in Angell 
for Tuesday lecture.

Free Speech in the Ivory Tower

b y J e r e m y K a p l a n, Daily Editorial Board Member

I“College students testify: Free speech under 

assault on campuses” from Fox News, and “War 

on campus: The escalating battle over col-

lege free speech” from CNN. These hysterical 

headlines fuel the widespread perception that 

millennial Americans on college campuses 

are becoming increasingly hostile toward free 

speech — at the alarm of their parents. Yet what 

campus activists and student government lead-

ers actually want from their administrators is 

frequently overlooked as conflicts and media 

storms escalate. Increasingly, coverage of these 

conflicts has placed rhetoric over policy, leaving 

what students actually want out of the debate. 

While these leaders and activists aren’t the 

ones shaping final University of Michigan poli-

cy, their voices are felt across campus, and will 

likely shape the coming generation’s perception 

of the issue. This alarm has also reached Michi-

gan’s state legislature. State senator Patrick Col-

beck (R-Canton) introduced legislation in May 

to strengthen free speech policies in public uni-

versities and colleges. If passed, the bill would 

require that public schools to permit all speak-

ers on campus. 

Recent events have certainly given the public 

reason for alarm. In February, a planned speech 

at the University of California at Berkeley by 

former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was 

canceled after large protests turned violent. 

The alt-right internet personality is famous for 

harassing a transgender student by name at 

the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, among 

other provocations. A professor at Middlebury 

College was injured in March after protesters 

attacked her for escorting controversial speaker 

Charles Murray, who has been associated with 

quasi-social-Darwinist views, as they tried to 

leave the event. And Michigan State University 

recently denied a request to host an event of 

white supremacist Richard Spencer’s National 

Policy Institute — a key organizer of the deadly 

August white nationalist march in Charlottes-

ville. 

While these incidents tend to draw the most 

derision from conservatives, the divide over 

speech is also generational. Forty percent of 

millennials believe the government should be 

able to restrict speech offensive to minorities, 

while only 27 percent of those ages 35 to 50 and 

just 24 percent of those between 51 and 69 hold 

the same view, a 2015 Pew Research Center poll 

found. That this is a generational divide and not 

simply a political one has implications for the 

future of the debate. This isn’t an issue that will 

get lost in the 24-hour news cycle — it is here to 

stay, particularly for young people.

As such, this debate has increasingly impact-

ed the campus climate. In April of 2016, for-

mer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 

received a hostile reaction from some students 

at the University’s commencement when he 

labeled “safe spaces” dangerous because they 

create a “false impression that we can insulate 

ourselves from those who hold different views” 

in his keynote speech. Last September, a debate 

at the Michigan League organized by the Michi-

gan Political Union — a nonpartisan student 

forum for political debate — discussing wheth-

er or not the Black Lives Matter movement was 

“harmful to racial relations in the United States” 

was disrupted by hundreds of protesters claim-

ing the event trivialized the lives of African 

American students.

Underlying this contemporary debate is a 

fundamental conflict: How can universities 

ensure a welcoming campus environment for 

all while guaranteeing a free exchange of ideas? 

If a university’s mission is to create an inclusive 

environment conducive to providing an educa-

tion for all, how should it approach the expres-

sion of free speech that may place students in 

danger?

More practically, can some forms of speech 

truly be objectively unacceptable and therefore 

worthy of restriction on a college campus? If so, 

who should be making those necessarily objec-

tive decisions? University administrators? A siz-

able portion of a campus’ community?

The University of Michigan, as a public uni-

versity with the legal obligation as a public 

institution to protect free speech as described 

in the First Amendment, has guidelines that 

state it must do all within its power to protect 

community members’ or invited speakers’ rights 

to speak freely and to protect those who wish to 

listen or communicate with speakers.

Other universities have announced modifi-

cations to their policies to deal with changing 

tides. Texas A&M University announced only 

recognized student organizations would be 

able to rent space to host speakers on campus, 

after a private Texan rented space Spencer in 

December.

If the University decides that changes to Uni-

versity policy on free speech and expression 

are warranted given recent events, the views of 

activists and members of student government 

will play a major role in their success. These 

leaders play an important role in determining 

the campus climate on any given issue, so the 

views they hold should be accessible as the Uni-

versity navigates these waters.

*****

To CSG President Anushka Sarkar, an LSA 

senior, the administration has the right to limit 

what speakers should be permitted on cam-

pus, taking student safety and reception from 

the University community into account. Sarkar 

believes some forms of hateful speech do not 

provide educational purposes for students; spe-

cifically singling out white supremacists.

“There’s a strong distinction between having 

John McCain speak at the University of Michi-

gan versus having Richard Spencer speak at the 

University of Michigan,” she said. “There is con-

structive benefit of engaging someone who has 

had a long career in policy and advocacy work 

in views that oppose, perhaps your own. But 

having Richard Spencer who is a neo-Nazi, por-

trayed as someone whose views oppose your 

own is not going far enough. I do think there is a 

line between what is acceptable to engage with 

and what is not.”

For Sarkar and many of her peers, the Univer-

sity community at large has a right to determine 

who gets to speak.

“If there is a small cohort of students on cam-

pus who believe that Richard Spencer should be 

allowed to campus and speak about his views, 

when those views threaten the very values and 

safety of students on campus, there are things 

of higher importance that need to be priori-

tized, such as the values and safety of students,” 

Sarkar said. “The speakers that have been 

rejected or shut down by the student body have 

been in diametric opposition to our university’s 

values and the safety and security of students.”

But some campus activists feel otherwise. 

LSA senior Grant Strobl, the national chairman 

of Young Americans for Freedom, an organiza-

tion dedicated to promoting conservative ideals 

on college campuses across the country, finds 

the policy to be sufficient in theory, but a failure 

in practice. Strobl gained national prominence 

when he protested the University’s decision to 

allow students to specify pronouns in Wolverine 

Access by making his own “His Majesty.” From 

Strobl’s perspective, the University has failed to 

fully enforce its own guidelines; notably, dur-

ing the contentious September 2016 MPU Black 

Lives Matter debate.

“They basically took over the entire event,” 

Strobl said of protesters. “The University in that 

situation does have an obligation to ensure 

that the original event goes as planned, and to 

remove those protesters; they didn’t enforce 

their own policy.”

According to University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald, the University has a high bar for when 

to intervene in protests, and has not done so 

in recent memory. In the case of the Michigan 

Political Union debate, Fitzgerald said University 

police were on hand, but did not intervene.

Strobl additionally believes the University 

must ensure it is protecting all speakers’ rights, 

entirely independent of what their ideas.

“If the University prides itself on being a 

limited public forum where students can host 

speakers, they have to protect speakers and the 

event in a viewpoint neutral manner,” Strobl said. 

“They just absolutely have to. Otherwise we go 

down on the slippery slope of just banning peo-

ple we disagree with.”

Strobl believes the threat of violence in the 

community should never be grounds for the 

University to cancel a speaker, claiming protest-

ing a speaker with the intent to cancel an event 

interferes with the speaker’s right to free speech. 

University policy states that protesters may not 

interfere with a speaker’s ability to freely express 

their thoughts, or an audience’s attempt to com-

prehend them, but are free to protest outside an 

event.

Strobl’s arguments were echoed by Nicholas 

Fadanelli, president of LSA Student Government, 

who also stated that protests should not be used 

to silence speech some find objectionable.

“Individuals can protest and show their dis-

satisfaction, their disapproval or their plain con-

demnation of what a speaker might be saying,” 

Fadanelli said. “But not to the point where you 

have a rule of mob situation where events can be 

shut down kind of on whim.”

But Fadanelli cautioned his position, adding 

that inciting violence — including displaying 

symbols associated with genocide — shouldn’t 

necessarily be protected.

Vikrant Garg, a Public Health student and 

organizer for the Students4Justice activist 

group, sees the continued toleration of hate as 

problematic on campus. He believes students 

should have the right to take matters into their 

own hand to not tolerate someone they consider 

hateful.

“There’s a huge disconnect I think from a lot 

of people not understanding that when you tol-

erate something that is inherently violent to a 

lot of people in its language, (and) in its history, 

it’s going to then continue to be violent against 

those people, and then it’s going to escalate that 

violence,” Garg said. “If what someone is saying 

is really horrible, then I think that they (students) 

should be shutting it down. And if in effect that 

person can no longer be heard by the people 

that came to listen to them, then good for them.”

However, Garg still feels that the University is 

responsible for condemning hate speech.

“A community makes it known when some-

thing isn’t necessarily welcome, and a univer-

sity should follow suit and condemn something 

when the community has condemned some-

thing,” Garg said.

The American Civil Liberties Union, among 

other civil rights organizations, have raised 

concerns about universities taking increasingly 

restrictive policies on free speech. The distinc-

tion between “hate speech” and other forms 

of “allowable” speech being pushed for by some 

campus voices is a specific point of contention, as 

there is no concrete definition of “hate speech” in 

American case law that can legally be curtailed; 

although such a distinction exists in many European 

legal systems.

“When we grant the government the power 

to suppress controversial ideas,” the ACLU web-

site reads, “we are all subject to censorship by the 

state.”

If the University, with the power of the state, 

gets to decide which speech is worth preventing to 

maintain the safety of students, it will need some 

framework to make that decision in an account-

able and democratic fashion, and in a manner that 

would not undermine its mission as a place for the 

free exchange of ideas.

University President Mark Schlissel issued a call 

to students to consider their roles in addressing 

hateful speech during his address at New Student 

Convocation on Friday.

“Will you take the risk to speak out if your class-

mates are targeted?” Schlissel asked the freshmen. 

“Will you reject a purposefully hateful speaker on 

campus by protesting, by instead seeking produc-

tive dialogue, or by simply ignoring them?” 

******

Among students, the clashing visions of free 

speech were on full display this past spring when 

resolutions were introduced in both Central Student 

Government and LSA Student Government, calling 

upon each body to take a firm stand in defense of 

individuals’ rights to express opinions even in the 

face of adverse reactions from elements of the com-

munity. A LSA Student Government resolution — 

calling upon the LSA Student Government to release 

a statement in support of free speech on campus — 

passed unanimously in April. However, after much 

debate, a similar resolution introduced in CSG failed 

in a 31-to-5 vote, with two abstentions. 

The author of the resolution, now-University 

alum Deion Kathawa, felt that the characterization 

of the resolution as contentious was an insult to the 

idea of free expression itself, further alleging the 

resolution faced procedural opposition from many 

CSG leaders.

“My resolution was smeared as ‘contentious.’ 

With respect, I resent this characterization,” Katha-

wa wrote in The Michigan Review, a conservative 

campus paper. “That there is not broad agreement 

that free speech ought to be a universally beloved 

value serves only to show how coarsened our shared 

political life has become, how politicized even our 

university — and universities across the country — 

has become.”

Sarkar defended the result of the CSG vote, argu-

ing the resolution was redundant, as she believed 

free speech has adequate protections on campus 

already and that additional reaffirmations were 

not necessary for advancing the body’s interests, 

although she opened the door to considering a simi-

lar resolution in the future, as contexts change.

“The majority of representatives did not feel that 

the principles of free speech at UMich were at risk, 

nor did they feel that the right to freedom of expres-

sion was at risk,” Sarkar said.

Fadanelli chalked up the different results primar-

ily to the individuals who introduced the resolutions 

in both bodies, and their backgrounds on the issue. 

The resolution that came before LSA Student Gov-

ernment was introduced by sponsors known by the 

assembly to hold political views across the political 

spectrum, which helped convince the body of its 

merits.

So far, the debates on this issue have largely 

been confined to college campuses, periodically 

spilling into the national consciousness; drawing 

media attention and political fire. However, as 

millennials increasingly enter the workforce and 

broader society, the footprint of their views on 

free speech will likely impact the national conver-

sation in more consequential ways.

M

y 
mother 

would 
often 

express 
a 

desire to move to the West 
Coast when she retired.

In Seattle, or perhaps 

San Francisco, the win-
ters are milder, the cities 
livelier and there are more 
native 
Chinese 
speakers 

for her than in our Detroit 
suburb. To her, Michigan 
winters are too long, the 
suburban sprawl of south-
east Michigan too quiet 
and the options for quality 
Chinese food too limiting.

These places beckoned 

to her because they resem-
bled 
— 
culturally 
and 

physically — where she 
had grown up: A bustling 
city nestled in Southern 
China.

Growing up, this love of 

one’s childhood home was 
alien to me. I had lived in 
Canton, Michigan for the 

entirety of my formative 
years. Before 
leaving 

for 
college, 
I 
had 
only 

moved 
once; 

when I was two 
years old, to a house 
in an adjacent subdi-
vision that was also in 
Canton.

Tucked 
on 
the 

westernmost edge of 
the Detroit suburbs, 
Canton 
Township 

primarily 
consists 

of subdivisions con-
structed 
within 
a 

five-year 
window 

beginning 
in 
the 

late 1990s; each house 
is 
seemingly 
plucked 

from the same catalog of 
a dozen or so designs. A 
grid of roads connects the 
vast low-density residen-
tial expanses to a few strip 
malls and big-box retail-
ers, interspersed with the 
occasional 
public 
green 

space.

Because such a large 

portion of the population 
consists 
of 
transplants 

who followed the late-90s 
building boom, it lacks the 
social cohesion that one 
could expect in a small 
country 
village. 
Mean-

while, the low population 
density of the suburb also 
means that the area lacks 
the benefits of a large city. 
The cohesion is further 
stunted by the fact that 
most of the working popu-
lation evacuates to offices 
and factories beyond the 
township limits every day.

For 
one-third 
of 
the 

year, the weather hangs 

between summer and 

winter; 
too 
warm 

for 
snow, 
yet 

cold enough 

to chill 

off 
any 

leaves 
from 
the 

trees or green 
from the grass.

To the credit of the 

community, 
Canton 
was 

— and continues to be — 
far from a “bad” town, 
and it is a town that I owe 
much of my comfortable 
and 
privileged 
upbring-

ing to. Crime is sparse, the 
public schools are filled 
with 
opportunities 
and 

the front lawns are well 
mown. Yet to my younger 
self, this suburban perfec-
tion felt more like subur-
ban monotony. Michigan, 
as a whole, seemed to be in 
a perpetual state of melan-
cholic decline: Detroit and 
the automotive industry a 
shell of their former selves, 
people and jobs being two 
of 
our 
most 
auspicious 

exports.

Around age 10, I vowed 

that I would leave Michi-
gan as soon as I was old 
enough. I had come to 
understand 
there 
was 

a 
more 
colorful 
world 

beyond the Midwest; pre-
sumably free from long 
winters and boredom.

However, 
when 
the 

time came to choose a col-
lege, I deferred my quest 
to escape the Mitten for 

at least four more years 
to come to Ann Arbor. 
I 
had 
momentarily 

allowed myself to be 

mesmerized by Ann 

Arbor: by the city, 

the 
University 

of Michigan’s 

programs 

and 
school’s 
programs 
and 
in-state 

tuition long enough 
to put down my enroll-
ment deposit — despite its 
location, a 25-minute drive 
from the town I so vowed 
to leave behind.

At the tail-end of my 

sophomore year of col-
lege, I received an offer 
to intern in Miami, and 
my choice seemed natural 
enough. This was my first 
opportunity to live outside 
of Michigan on my own for 
more than the length of a 
vacation, and Miami rep-

resented to me everything 
Canton was not.

But while I was charmed 

by the beaches, colorful 
neighborhoods and palm 
trees of south Florida, a 
subtle nostalgia for what 
had been the classic fix-
tures of a childhood sum-
mer in Michigan crept on 
my conscience.

There 
would 
be 
no 

weekend trips this sum-
mer up to the lakeshore 
in Traverse City where I 
could hike the Sleeping 
Bear 
Dunes 
and 
polish 

Petoskey stones from the 
frigid, 
clear 
lake 
water. 

I would be absent for my 
hometown’s “Liberty Fes-
tival” and firework display, 
always conspicuously held 

two weeks before the 

actual Fourth of 

July.

When-
ever 
I 

men-

tioned 
my 
hometown 
— to co-work-
ers, locals and Lyft 
drivers — three of the 
most common responses 
were remarks about how 
the state was cold, provin-
cial and supposedly on the 
decline. My use of the term 
“pop” also drew curious 

looks.

“Detroit — everyone’s 

trying to leave there,” one 
Lyft driver quipped dur-
ing an otherwise pleasant 
drive.

While I perfectly under-

stood these perceptions — 
after all, I had held many 
of these sentiments at one 
point or another — such a 
characterization didn’t do 
justice to my childhood 
home or the people I had 
grown up with.

Sure, 
Michigan 
was 

tucked in the “provincial” 
Midwest, but there was 
also an indescribable Mid-
western charm that I now 
realized I had taken for 
granted my entire life.

Carpool parents treated 

me as a part of their own 
family; I bit into an orchard-
picked Red Delicious in the 
crisp October air and got 
lost in the miles of winding 
wooded trails across the 
state. All of this had become 
part of me, and I couldn’t 

simply forsake it once I 

graduated.

When I was recently 

talking to my moth-

er 
about 
possible 

places to retire, I 

casually 
raised 

the possibility of 
getting a house 
in Ann Arbor 
along 
the 

Huron River, 
or 
perhaps 

even a lake 
house 
in 

Traverse 

City.
“Why 
on 

Earth would I do 

that, Brian?” she 

replied.

I 
chuckled 
softly 
to 

myself. How could I expect 
her to understand? After all, 
she hadn’t grown up here.

DESIGN BY MICHELLE PHILLIPS

If at first you try

W

hen 
I 
was 

younger, 
I 

played every 

sport you would expect a 
young kid to. From swim-
ming to tennis to dance to 
softball, I had all the bases 
covered. I was never the 
best at any of them, but 
these activities made me 
happy. When I graduated 
from fifth grade, I found 
myself 
becoming 
more 

interested in the perform-
ing arts than sports. I was 
in every school play and 
won several state titles in 
prose debate competitions: 
a piece of dramatic inter-
pretation 
performed 
in 

eight minutes.

Performing allowed me 

to take a break from real-
ity, to transform myself 
into different characters, 
many of which I had noth-
ing in common with. Many 
of the characters I played 
in high school were drug 
addicts, 
schizophrenics 

and girls with no ambi-
tion (see: Frenchie from 
“Grease”). 
These 
oppor-

tunities 
allowed 
me 
to 

become something I would 
never be, and I loved that.

Many of my teachers 

asked me if I was going to 
continue theater in col-
lege, and I always had the 
same reply: “I hope so.” 
Eager about what was to 
come in my final year of 

high school theater, I was 
convinced I would pursue 
performing arts in college.

When senior year rolled 

around and I auditioned 
for the fall musical, I was 
devastated when I saw the 
cast list. I was in the cho-
rus and only had one line. 

Just the year before I was 
the lead. I was crushed, 
upset that I’d lose the 
community that gave me a 
stage to grow both physi-
cally and mentally.

My senior year of high 

school was tough. I had 
smart classmates to com-
pete with to get into the 
most competitive schools, 
and I knew my test scores 
were not as good as those 
of my peers, which took a 
toll on my confidence. I 

stopped eating, my hair 
started 
falling 
out 
and 

my relationships with my 
friends suffered.

Overwhelmed 
by 
the 

fact that I had no control 
over my future, I instead 
controlled what I could: 
my diet. I became very 
weak, 
growing 
fatigued 

during 
simple 
day-to-

day 
activities. 
I 
wasn’t 

restricting myself because 
I wanted to lose weight — 
in fact I was so anxious 
that I didn’t even think I 
was restricting myself. I 
wasn’t eating because how 
could I when I woke up 
each morning unsure if I 
would fail another AP Cal-
culus exam? Or get reject-
ed from another school? 
Looking back, I’m embar-
rassed by these negative 
thoughts. They consumed 
my consciousness, tugging 
at my mental and physical 
well-being, and I didn’t 
even realize it.

Flash 
forward 
a 
year 

and I’m sitting in a lec-
ture hall at one of the best 
public universities in the 
country. I started taking 
medication for my anxiety, 
eating real food again and 
doing yoga. I’d tried yoga 
in high school, but eventu-
ally dropped it because of 
my busy schedule.

I quickly found that yoga 

was the escape from reali-

ty — even if just for an hour 
a day— that I was miss-
ing since I’d left theater. 
Don’t get me wrong, yoga 
is a physically demanding 
activity, but I took com-
fort in the fact that, unlike 
cycling 
or 
CrossFit, 
I 

didn’t feel like I was being 
ordered to do anything I 
didn’t want to do. All my 
teachers made it very clear 
that you should only per-
form poses that serve your 
own unique body. I had 
never heard that before, 
and the acceptance I felt 
coming to yoga every day 
helped me to overcome a 
lot of my mental hardships 
that were still unresolved. 
I finally felt in control.

After becoming a regu-

lar yogi, there was still 
one pose that I just could 
not get right: Chaturanga 
Dandasana. 
Practiced 
in 

almost every yoga class, it 
serves to reset your body 
and begin a new sequence 
of poses or “flows.” Lots of 
instructors call it a “yoga 
pushup,” and I learned that 
it is, indeed, a yoga pushup. 
From the moment I was 
introduced to the correct 
alignment of the pose, I 
told myself I’d never be 
able to do it. I’d never even 
done 
a 
regular 
pushup 

before.

Doubt 
ran 
through 

my mind every time the 

instructor called the pose 
— and I didn’t realize how 
much 
this 
anxiety 
was 

limiting my practice. Yoga 

helps you experience dif-
ferent postures, although 
they might be challeng-
ing to hold, training you 
to deal with the negativity 
that floods your mind the 
moment you doubt your 
capabilities.

I knew that I wouldn’t 

nail this pose on my first 
try. Lots of yoga poses 
take months, even years, 
to master. I started slow 
and with the help of my 
teachers 
made 
minor 

adjustments to my align-
ment so that I could start 
to push my physical edge. 

Often, I felt like quitting 
just because I didn’t suc-
ceed the first time. Or, in 
other words, letting my 
anxieties 
paralyze 
me. 

But through my dedica-
tion to yoga I’ve learned 
the challenges that may 
have seemed impossible 
might actually be within 
my reach. It’s all about 
opening the heart, mind, 
body and soul, coming up 
into upward dog, lifting 
my heart to the world. I 
feel satisfaction by sim-
ply doing it, but also relief 
that I didn’t give up — 
didn’t let the little doubts 
and anxieties control me.

I 
didn’t 
start 
yoga 

because I needed to work 
out, I started because I 
needed to make peace 
with myself. I needed to 
learn that sometimes I fall 
down and that’s okay.

I know this sounds cli-

ché, but I have come to 
learn in these past two 
years that I’m more capa-
ble than I’d ever thought 
I was.

I have found my new 

stage, and performing on 
it makes me feel better 
inside and out. I no lon-
ger need someone to give 
me the lead. I can perform 
all that I am capable of 
in a space that allows all 
beings to be happy, peace-
ful and free.
