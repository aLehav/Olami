About 
150 
students 

gathered Monday afternoon 
in an Angell Hall auditorium 
for “Election 2016: Looking 
Under the Hood and Down the 
Road,” a panel of University of 
Michigan’s political science 
faculty also discussed the 
recent presidential election 
as a monumental shift in 
American politics.

The panel consisted of six 

LSA faculty members with 
concentrations in American 
politics, political psychology, 
public policy and the Middle 
East. 
Each 
presented 
an 

individual response to the 
election 
based 
on 
their 

concentration.

Political 
Science 
Prof. 

Lisa Disch moderated the 
panel and said the event was 
predominantly a data-based 
response to the election.

“We in political science 

are in a position where we’re 
able to look at the events of 
the past month in a way that’s 

about fact, not perception, 
and we can help explain what 
might be coming next,” she 
said.

Each panelist emphasized 

in their remarks the general 

uncertainty 
of 
the 
data 

already 
collected 
about 

the election and the future 
political 
climate. 
Panelist 

Ted Brader, a professor of 
political science, discussed 

the reliability of pre-election 
polls, emphasizing that they 
fell ultimately within a fair 
margin of error but were 
clearly not infallible.

On Monday, Laurence Ball, 

professor 
of 
economics 
at 

Johns 
Hopkins 
University, 

charged that the United States 
Federal Reserve was partially 
responsible 
for 
the 
2008 

bankruptcy for neglecting to bail 
out the Lehman Brothers. The 
lecture was in Hutchins Hall to a 
group of about 30 students.

Lehman 
was 
the 
fourth-

largest investment bank in the 
United States when it declared 
bankruptcy. 
A 
combination 

of falling stock prices, rating 
downgrades, increases in credit 
default swaps premiums on its 
debt and negative commentary 
in the media would result in the 
largest bankruptcy filing in U.S.

A attack on the Ohio State 

University’s campus Monday 
morning left at least nine 
victims injured. According to 
a statement from OSU police, 
a suspect, who was shot by 
campus police, ran victims over 
with a car and cut individuals 

with a butcher knife. Eight of 
those injured are stable, but 
one is in critical condition, 
according to the Associated 
Press.

The AP also stated that the 

shooter has been identified 
as OSU student Abdul Razak 
Ali Artan by the university’s 
public safety director Monica 
Moll. Artan was killed by Alan 
Horujko, a police officer at 

the university, after crashing 
his vehicle into pedestrians 
and attacking students with a 
knife.

A 
shelter 
in 
place 
on 

campus 
was 
lifted 
late 

Monday morning, after initial 
reports of an active shooter 
situation. 
Law 
enforcement 

officials are still conducting 
an investigation and campus 
sweep.

OSU police told media they 

did alo receive reports of shots 
fired in a campus building, 
although no reports of bullet 
wounds or injuries have been 
released. No deaths have been 
reported aside from a shooter, 
according to the AP.

OSU emergency management 

tweeted 
Monday 
morning 

alerting students about the 
situation, urging them to seek 

refuge and defend themselves 
if necessary. According to the 
tweet, a shooter was active in 
Watts Hall, OSU’s materials 
science 
and 
engineering 

building.

“run, 
hide, 
fight”

Jason 
Furman, 
President 

Barack Obama’s chief economist, 
spoke to a crowd of about 165 on 
public policy’s role in reducing 
poverty and the effect of certain 
Obama administration policies 
on income at the University of 
Michigan Monday.

During the talk, Furman said 

the United States has recently 
experienced a surprisingly strong 
recovery after the 2008 financial 
crisis, a worldwide economic 
downturn that resulted in mass 
job loss and decreased consumer 
spending.

In the years following the 

crisis, the unemployment rate 
has fallen below expectations,

We are proud to stand tall with 
you!

In the three weeks since the 

election of President-elect Donald 

Trump over Democratic presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton, many 

colleges and universities are speaking 

out to urge the president-elect to 

promote unity and peace in light of the 

rhetoric Trump promoted during his 

campaign 

Leading the charge is Bennington 

College, which has collected more 

than 110 signatures from college and 

university presidents on a letter calling 

for President-elect Trump to condemn 

acts of hate seen around college 

campuses and the nation. Many 

students on campus have expressed 

concern about the comments he has 

made on the campaign trail, which 

include increased immigration laws, 

promises to limit women’s health 

access and anti-Islam rhetoric.

Mariko Silver, the president of 

Bennington College, led the effort in 

creating the letter. In an interview 

with Inside Higher Ed, she said 

the letter came from discussions 

from students who felt “anxiety and 

uncertainty” because of the incidents 

on Bennington’s campus.

The letter quotes Trump’s 

promise at his election night rally to 

“seek common ground, not hostility; 

partnership, not conflict” and urges 

him to take advantage of his leadership 

and empower the vulnerable. It also 

outlines the values of the United States 

as “human decency, equal rights, 

freedom of expression, and freedom 

from discrimination,” encouraging 

Trump to reinforce these principles 

during his tenure.

Since the election, two incidents 

classified as a type of hate crimes 

have occurred at the University of 

Michigan. In one of the incidents 

on Nov. 11, a man demanded that a 

female student remove her hijab or 

he would set her on fire. On Nov. 12, 

a female student was yelled at by two 

men for being American, referenced 

her religion and pushed down a hill. 

Additionally, a student came home to 

a swastika drawn in his apartment 

that week.

University President Mark 

Schlissel has sent out University-

wide emails condemning incidents 

such as these and has outlined 

resources for students who have 

experienced attacks or harassment, 

but has not signed the letter started by 

Bennington.

One of Schlissel’s biggest 

initiatives during his presidency so 

far has been his Diversity, Equity and 

Inclusion Plan, which aims to create a 

more diverse and welcoming campus 

for students of all identities. However, 

Schlissel has been criticized for not 

doing enough in terms of increasing 

diversity, and students have expressed 

their frustration throughout the 

semester at protests and community 

forums.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said Monday in an 

email interview that he had no 

information regarding the letter and 

whether Schlissel would be joining 

the list of signatures.

BRIEF: UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS PEN LETTER TO TRUMP

AARON BAKER/Daily

Writer Alison Swan leads a book club discussion on sustainable food at 
Literati bookstore Monday. 

BOOK CLU B

Robert 
Neumann, 
police 

chief of the University of 
Michigan’s 
Department 
of 

Public Safety and Security, 
spoke with faculty leaders 
about 
prominent 
safety 

issues on campus on Monday, 
including 
the 
department’s 

handling of rape allegations 
and 
the 
extent 
to 
which 

campus police are armed. 
The discussion was part of a 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs meeting.

Neumann 
and 
Richard 

Friedman, Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs police oversight chair, 
discussed the importance of 
DPSS being armed in light 
of emergencies like active 
shooters. Earlier Monday, a 

20-year-old student attacked 
at least nine people at Ohio 
State University, leaving one 
victim in critical condition. 
The attacker, a former OSU 
student, was killed by Alan 
Horujko, a police officer at 
the university, after crashing 
his vehicle into pedestrians 
and attacking students with a 
knife.

“What happened at Ohio 

State 
is 
exactly 
why 
the 

University 
or 
any 
police 

department 
to 
operate 

effectively needs to have the 
ability to take down an active 
shooter with a field rifle,” 
Neumann said.

UMPD 
officers 
carry 

pistols, but often do not carry 
stun guns, tasers or other non-
lethal 
weapons, 
Neumann 

later said.

In response to a question 

asked by Pharmacy Prof. David 

Smith 
regarding 
whether 

there is a conflict of interest 
when athletes who bring in 
revenue for the University 
are being investigated in a 
rape 
allegation, 
Neumann 

said DPSS is always objective 
and 
professional 
in 
their 

investigations.

“The 
administration 

understands our role as an 
independent law enforcement 
agency is that Washtenaw 
County 
Prosecutor’s 
Office 

trusts 
us 
to 
be 
objective 

and follow the facts where 
they lead,” Neumann said. 
“Athletics in particular is an 
area with a lot of sensitivity 
and so they probably get less 
slack than anyone else, quite 
honestly.”

Neumann also explained 

the process by which DPSS 
sends out crime alerts, saying 
the alert may not go out until, 
at times, several days after the 
crime was committed. After a 
man threatened to set a student 
on fire if she did not remove 
her hijab on campus earlier 
this month, a crime alert was 
sent out a day after the attack. 
At a City Council meeting on 
Nov. 21, a University lecturer 
spoke about being assaulted on 
campus, called for University 
action including a crime alert.

“Sometimes 
the 
incident 

doesn’t come to our attention 
until a day or two later and 
that’s a factor, an ongoing 
investigation or the case may 
be solved very quickly are also 
factors,” Neumann said. “To 
the extent that we can release 
information that we are highly 
confident is accurate, clear 
and timely and will help keep 
the community safe — these 
are some of the factors that go 
into it.”

SACUA 
members 
also 

discussed how to respond 
to a potential visit by white 
nationalist Richard Spencer,

real 
wages 
—wages 
adjusted 

for inflation — have grown and 
income has increased for people 
in lower and middle classes. But 
Furman said despite these factors, 
the United States’ recovery is not 
complete.

He cited lowered productivity 

growth, which is the measure 
of 
efficiency 
of 
production, 

as a longer-term issue for the 
economy and said the decline 
seen in the the levels of firm entry 
and growth results in the decline 
of competition in the economy.

Furman 
also 
discussed 

increased inequality following 
the recession, which he said 
resulted from a rising demand for 
skilled labor and a slower increase 
in the rate of education. He added 
that an increase in unionization 
resulted 
in 
an 
increase 
in 

percentage of money going to the 
bottom percent, noting that the 
real value of the minimum wage 
has decreased.

“(The United States) is not 

just higher than everyone else in 
terms of the share when we talk 
1 percent, but also has seen faster 
increase in inequality for the top 1 
percent than in other countries,” 
he said.

Furman cited decreased labor 

force participation. Furman said 
the 
labor 
force 
participation 

as another barrier, saying the 
participation rate peaked in the 
1950s, but has been declining ever 
since.

“For women, we saw this big 

increase which is what caused the 
overall increase, but that stopped 
around 2000, has declined since 
then, and there’s a huge gap 
between the trend we were on 
and what has happened since 
then,” he said.

Along 
with 
the 
economy, 

Furman 
discussed 
effects 
of 

policies 
enacted 
during 
the 

Obama 
administration. 
He 

said the Affordable Care Act, 
or “Obamacare,” has shrunk 
the uninsured rate to below 10 
percent for the first time, and 
health care spending has grown 
slowly in both public and private 
sectors.

Rackham 
student 
Elird 

Haxhiu, an attendee, stressed 
the importance of learning about 
public policy, and said Furman 
brought up very interesting points 
about inequality, job growth and 
wage stagnation.

“I wasn’t aware that the female 

labor force participation had been 
declining since the 2000s; that 
was new to me,” Haxhiu said. “It 
was interesting to hear some of 
the policymakers reiterate some 
of the same things that we talk 

about. When we’re voting for 
leaders, I think it’s important to 
know that their proposals could 
actually go in practice and what 
effect those proposals might 
have.”

Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student Esi Hutchful echoed this 
sentiment, noting the overlap 
between material covered in the 
talk and her economics classes.

“That moment he talked about 

the thought experiment he did 
on his own, on what would have 
happened if productivity would 
have increased and everything 
else stayed the same, if wages 
increased and everything else 
stayed the same, etc., was really 
interesting,” Hutchful said.

She 
also 
said 
the 
talk 

highlighted 
importance 
of 

understanding public policy and 
how it can lead the nation to be 
more informed and participate in 
political discussions.

“Public 
policy 
really 

determines everything you can 
touch on and determines potential 
solutions to the problems we 
have now — it’s where we are 
able to define what exactly these 
problems are, who are going to 
be the winners and losers of any 
given policy,” Hutchful said. 
“Even if you’re not determining 
what the policy is, being able to 
understand that conversation is 
obviously really important.”

recession that began in 2008, 
saying that despite other large 
investment firms also failing 
around 
the 
same 
time, 
he 

believes Lehman’s bankruptcy 
was particularly consequential.

“I think it’s quite possible to 

likely that the financial crisis 
would’ve been less severe had 
Lehman been rescued,” Ball said.

Citing 
the 
disruption, 
he 

challenged the Federal Reserve’s 
choice not to bail it out, saying 
the reserve could have kept all of 
the Lehman Brothers Holdings 
Inc. in operation for months with 
well-secured liquidity support.

Instead, 
he 
said 
Federal 

Reserve officials claimed they 
did not have the legal authority 
to lend Lehman the money it 
needed to survive. The Federal 
Reserve used Section 13-3 of the 
Federal Reserve Act, which states 
Federal Reserve officials cannot 
take on substantial financial risk, 

to justify their decision. But Ball 
said his calculations show they 
could have prevented Lehman’s 
bankruptcy 
with 
negligible 

risk, because Lehman had $570 
billion of available collateral. 
Only an $88 billion loan would 
therefore have been necessary 
to substantially aid the Lehman 
firm.

He also charged that they 

chose not to bailout Lehman 
because 
of 
intense 
political 

opposution and a waning hope 
that 
the 
damage 
could 
be 

contained.

“My assessment of the Fed is 

that a lot of the claims they make 
are contradicted by evidence,” he 
said. “Their reasoning would not 
go over well on an undergraduate 
banking test.”

Ball also noted that the 

political 
attitudes 
of 
many 

citizens in 2008 included a 
wariness and distrust of Wall 
Street and large investment 
corporations. 

Some of the students present 

said they respected the tenacity 
with which Ball analyzed the 
numbers behind a potential 
Lehman 
rescue. 
Engineering 

freshman Aniket Wankhede said 
he agreed with Ball’s argument.

“He talked more about the 

inner workings of the Fed with 
respect to the Lehman crisis,” he 
said. “And the discussion about 
the investigation that ensued 
was very interesting. More than 
political were the economical 
implications and everything that 
happened afterward.”

Shomik Ghosh, a Law School 

student, said he approached 
Ball’s 
speech 
analytically. 

While he said he thought Ball’s 
approach 
was 
original 
and 

interesting, he also noted that 
many approaches to the Lehman 
bankruptcy puzzle exist.

“I think Ball presents a novel 

hypothesis that this decision may 
have been far more volitional 
and consequential than even 
the Federal Reserve may have 
known,” Ghosh said. “But in 
Lehman there was an actor that 
possibly misrepresented its own 
holdings and has engaged in 
really risky financial behavior. 
I think if he accounted for how 
Lehman might’ve been a bad 
actor, a separate angle may be 
that the feds had concern over 
whether saving them would’ve 
perpetuated 
what 
you 
may 

consider a disease in the system.”

In particular, Brader said 

key 
constituencies 
of 
the 

Republican 
and 
Democratic 

parties turned out in fewer 
numbers, 
which 
for 
him 

demonstrated the inaccuracy 
within projected voter models.

Following with the theme 

of partisan politics, panelists 
Charles 
Shipan 
and 
Jenna 

Bednar, professors of political 
science, highlighted possible 
consequences of a Republican 
president 
and 
Republican 

Congress.

Shipan said there was large 

potential for intense debate 
within Congress regarding the 
repeal and replacement of the 
Affordable Care Act. Bednar 
said the states could experience 
decreased autonomy that would 
affect issues such as education, 
health care and gun control 
under a unified Congress and 
presidency.

Political Science Prof. Mark 

Tessler also posed concerns 
about a potential departure 
from 
current 
U.S. 
policies 

toward the Middle East under 
a Trump presidency. Trump 
has 
called 
for 
increased 

immigration 
laws 
over 
the 

course of the campaign and has 
used anti-Islam rhetoric.

“It’d certainly be disturbing 

if the registration of American 
Muslims became a reality as 
Trump has discussed,” Tessler 
said. “And, what would be the 
larger implications for anti-
Americanism in the Middle 
East from such action?”

While there were no definite 

answers about the outcome 
of the election presented at 
Monday’s 
event, 
Political 

Science 
Prof. 
Nicholas 

Valentino showed data from his 
research that concluded gender 
attitudes and the emotional 
responses 
of 
voters 
may 

have contributed to Trump’s 
election.

“It’s 
not 
just 
the 

predispositions of voters that 
matter, it’s also about the 
emotional state of the public 
and anger as seen more in 
Republicans seemed to be much 
more mobilizing in the public 
than the fear that dominated 
the Democrats,” Valentino said.

Rackham 
student 

Emmamarie Haasl, a member of 
the audience, said she found the 
panel beneficial in processing 
the results of the election and 
considering the spectrum of 
political views.

“I think this was helpful in 

trying to get into the minds 
of voters and where they’re 
coming from in a more clinical 
way,” Haasl said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Dominic 

Valentino, 
son 
of 
panelist 

Nicholas Valentino, and LSA 
senior 
Lalitha 
Ramaswamy 

said they were disappointed 
at the lack of events initiating 
dialogue between students on 
opposite sides of the aisle.

“I was hoping for more of a 

discussion about how people 
felt about the election and 
people that disagreed with 
what was said today because 
I think that would be more 
productive 
for 
the 
campus 

climate,” Valentino said.

Ramaswamy 
agreed 
with 

Valentino 
and 
compared 

the structure of the panel to 
discussions sponsored by LSA.

“I think panels like this can 

help in understanding multiple 
perspectives, but I think more 
dialogue is necessary at this 
point,” she said. “The same 
people show up to these events 
and the same ideas are recycled, 
so using faculty to mediate 
student discussions could be 
more beneficial.”

who coined the term “alt-right,” 
a 
movement 
that 
promotes 

white supremacy and racism. 
Spencer told The Washington 
Post he would visit campus, 
but University spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen said in an 
email statement Sunday the 
University was not aware of 
any.

David 
Potter, 
an 
LSA 

representative to SACUA, said it 
is important for the University 
to be prepared.

“Maybe 
we 
should 
start 

thinking about coordinating 
with other groups on campus 
so that when we start getting 
people like Spencer showing up 
there is a coherent response,” 
Potter said. “We cannot wait 
until after he is already here.”

Engineering prof. Michael 

Atzmon, 
an 
Engineering 

representative to SACUA, noted 
instances of previous visits by 
similar individuals.

“There 
will 
always 
be 

violence in a case like that,” 
Atzmon 
said. 
“I 
remember 

when the KKK came to Ann 
Arbor.”

Kevin Hegarty, vice president 

and 
chief 
financial 
officer, 

also spoke at the meeting and 
answered 
faculty 
questions 

about the financial situation of 
the University.

Hegarty began by briefly 

discussing his responsibilities, 
which include the University’s 
finances, 
facilities 
and 

operations 
around 
campus, 

investment of the University’s 
portfolio as well as other 
duties. He said the University 
performed 
well, 
financially, 

this year, noting it’s debt.

“(The University) closed in 

very strong financial shape,” 
Hegarty said. “From a debt 
perspective, we ended the year 
with about $2 or $2.1 billion of 
debt, which I can tell you is not 
by any means overleveraged.”

In response to LSA Rep. 

and 
former 
SACUA 
chair 

Silke-Maria 
Weineck’s 

question regarding the ethical 
considerations of investment of 

University funds, Hegarty said 
profit is the overall objective. 
Many campus activists have 
urged the University to divest 
funds from companies they 
deem as unethical, such as 
those that have businesses in 
Israel or oil and coal companies.

“The board has taken the 

position that gives us the 
guidance as to how they want 
that 
portfolio 
ultimately 

invested,” Hegarty said. “They 
don’t want it to be a political 
football. They want to achieve 
the maximum return that they 
possibly can.”

Weineck responded to his 

answer by saying there is no 
way to invest the University 
portfolio without making a 
political statement.

“I think some people would 

say the very fact that certain 
ethical 
concerns 
are 
being 

handled politically is a political 
act,” Weineck said.

The 
annual 
investment 

report will be released Dec. 8 at 
the Board of Regents meeting, 
according to Hegarty.

O

n Oct. 11, 1975, NBC 
released a show called 
“Saturday 
Night 

Live,” which brought with it 
a 
revolutionary 

new 
genre 
that 

was 
based 
around 

sketch comedy. One 
particular 
recurring 

sketch within the first 
few episodes set a 
successful tone that the 
show, and many others 
like it, would continue. 
Cast member Chevy 
Chase sat behind a 
desk in a mock Oval 
Office 
and 
clumsily 

reported to the United States 
as the president and University 
alum, Gerald Ford. The era of 
television’s comedic presidential 
impersonations began with Chevy 
Chase 
hilariously 
capitalizing 

on the fact that President Ford 
unfortunately had a few accidents 
that made him appear clumsy and 
awkward — traits that “SNL” and 
Chase transformed into comedic 
gold. And all of this was received, 
both by the American public and by 
Ford, to some degree, in a positive 
and jovial way. 

And this sketch continued. 

Every president and presidential 
candidate following Gerald Ford 
was impersonated and recreated 
through several talented actors 
capitalizing on any trivial claim 
that could be stretched and 
overacted to make America laugh. 
From Dana Carvey as the WASP-y 
and nasally George H.W. Bush, 
to Kate McKinnon playing the 
almost robotic Secretary Hillary 

Clinton, “SNL” used the men and 
women seeking and holding the 
office of the president as a means 
of relatable comedy. It was all 

easy to write, easy to 
act and recognizable 
to 
every 
American. 

It suddenly became 
part of the job — when 
becoming 
president, 

you 
should 
expect 

your own comedic and 
moronic doppelganger 
to constantly satirize 
every potential choice 
you make.

So when the first 

episode 
of 
“SNL” 

following the election capitalized 
on the fact that the Trump 
transition was not running as 
smoothly as some had hoped, Alec 
Baldwin put his incredible acting 
skills and the seemingly endless 
amount of comedic material to 
use. He delivered a hilarious 
performance of our president-elect, 
frantically asking Siri, “How do I 
beat ISIS?” and realizing that the 
border along Mexico is actually 
2,000 miles long.

And almost right on schedule, 

our president-elect dropped all 
other 
“adult” 
responsibilities 

surrounding 
the 
peaceful 

transition 
of 
presidential 

administrations, and fell again 
into his juvenile and bully-
like Twitter rants in which he 
condemned the entirety of “SNL” 
and the poor impersonation they 
had presented of him. This trend, 
this ongoing sketch that satirizes 
the most recognizable position in 
the world, is crossing the line for 

our president-elect.

Yet, I view this single outburst of 

angry emotion from a 70-year-old 
billionaire as one of many that prove 
to serve as testament to the fragility 
of his ego and the focus of his actual 
attention. Throughout the entirety 
of his life, President-elect Trump 
has 
focused 
an 
unbelievable 

amount of time, money and effort 
toward the retribution of those 
who criticize his name, looks 
and actions. From the constant 
threatening 
correspondence 

toward 
Spy 
Magazine, 
which 

stated he was a “short-fingered 
vulgarian,” to the actual lawsuits he 
filed against comedian Bill Maher, 
who stated he would donate $5 
million to charity if birther Donald 
Trump could prove his mother was 
not an orange-haired orangutan, 
Trump hunted down any critique 
of himself with every asset on hand. 
Anyone who damages his ego is a 
viable target, and as demonstrated 
by the “failing” New York Times in 
its piece, “The 282 People, Places 
and Things Donald Trump has 
insulted on Twitter” — a list that 
includes every single major-party 
presidential 
candidate, 
entire 

nations, every major TV network, 
journalists, the residential lectern 
in the White House, a gold star 
family and my favorite, the pope.

And one could assume that all 

of those petty and ridiculous rants 
and immature verbal onslaughts 
usually ending in “Bad!!” would 
somehow 
guarantee 
that 
this 

insufferable 5-year-old would be 
deemed incapable of becoming 
president. 
Yet 
America 
has 

surprised us all again.

But now Trump and his fragile 

image of himself holds the most 
powerful office in the world. 
And the implications of this 
situation should be very clear. His 
pettiness and lack of affability 
toward comedic representations 
of himself have been blatantly 
demonstrated 
throughout 
the 

entirety of his public life. The 
man cannot stand an ounce of 
criticism — whether it be Alec 
Baldwin simply restating things 
Trump has said verbatim, or 
the pope saying that building 
walls is not the Christian answer 
to immigration issues, he has 
countered with some of the 
most deplorable and disgusting 
rhetoric 
within 
American 

political discourse.

So if it is even possible, set aside 

the other horrific factors that will 
become the Trump presidency. 
Set aside Vice President-elect 
Mike Pence and his blatant hatred 
toward women’s and LGBTQ 
rights. Set aside National Security 
Adviser Mike Flynn, who believes 
Islam is an ideology meant to 
destroy America. Set aside Steve 
Bannon, a man who has been 
the voice for racists and white 
supremacists across the country. 
Set 
aside 
every 
disturbing 

thought associated with who and 
what will influence this future 
administration, and simply picture 
how Trump will respond to such 
goofy and comical criticisms from 
“SNL” when he has the power of 
presidency behind him.

T

he Oxford Dictionaries 
just named “post-truth” 
the word of the year. They 

define “post-truth” as “relating 
to or denoting circumstances 
in which objective facts are less 
influential in shaping 
public opinion than 
appeals to emotion 
and 
personal 

belief.” The popular 
examples of “post-
truth” 
culture 
are 

the rhetoric used by 
the Brexit campaign 
and Donald Trump’s 
campaign.

There’s 
an 

interview with Newt 
Gingrich at the RNC 
that 
is 
painfully 

representative of the 
“post-truth” 
era. 
A 

news anchor says to Gingrich 
that violent crime rates are 
down. Gingrich corrects her 
that there are some cities 
where violent crime is up, and 
the 
news 
anchor 
concedes 

this point, but maintains that 
though in some places violent 
crime is up, nationally violent 
crime rates are down. Gingrich 
says that doesn’t matter. He says 
that when everyday Americans 
wake up in the morning, they 
don’t feel safe, and they feel like 
violent crime rates are up. The 
news anchor says they might 
feel that way, but the facts 
say otherwise: Violent crime 
rates are down; we are “safer.” 
Gingrich then says, “No, that’s 
your view” and she says, “No, 
these are facts,” these are FBI 
statistics, and he says, “What I 
said is also a fact.”

No, what Gingrich says is 

not a fact, it’s a belief. But 
we 
can’t 
just 
dismiss 
the 

conflation between facts and 
beliefs as something only done 
by power hungry, insincere 
politicians. 
The 
distinction 

between facts and beliefs is 
increasingly blurred, and not 
only in the realm of electoral 
politics. There is, in fact, a legal 
precedent for the murky and 
vanishing difference between 
facts and beliefs, and it’s found 
in the Supreme Court ruling in 
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.

In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 

the court ruled that closely held 
for-profit private corporations 
can be exempt from certain 
laws 
that 
go 
against 
the 

corporation owner’s “sincerely 
held religious beliefs” if there 
is another way to enforce the 
law through means that won’t 
violate the owner’s religious 
beliefs. What I’m interested in 
is the concept of a “sincerely 
held religious belief.”

The “sincerely held religious 

belief” in question in this case 
had to do with contraception. 
The Green family, the owners 
of Hobby Lobby, and the Hahn 
Family, the owners of Conestoga 

Wood 
Specialties, 

both rejected having 
to 
provide 
their 

employees 
with 

access 
(through 

insurance under the 
Affordable Care Act) 
to four specific types 
of 
birth 
control: 

IUDs, 
copper 

and 
hormonal, 

and 
emergency 

contraception 
pills, 

Plan B and ella.

The Greens and 

the Hahns believe(d) 
that 
life 
begins 
at 

conception, and by conception 
they mean fertilization. They 
morally 
reject 
these 
four 

types of birth control because 
they think they can prevent a 
fertilized egg from implanting 
in the uterus, which they 
consider to be an abortion. The 
issue here is that scientists who 
actually study contraceptives 

and the reproductive system 
say that IUDs and emergency 
contraceptive pills do not stop 
an already fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus.

IUDs 
and 
emergency 

contraceptive pills will not 
stop an existing pregnancy. 
They are not abortion pills. 
Emergency 
contraception 

works by preventing the sperm 
from fertilizing the egg, either 
by trapping the sperm in mucus 
or preventing the egg from 
being released and fertilized, 
depending on the kind of 
contraception you take. If the 
sperm has already fertilized 
the 
egg, 
the 
emergency 

contraception will have no 
impact. It will not stop a 
fertilized egg from implanting 
in the uterus and it will not do 
anything if a fertilized egg has 

already implanted in the uterus.

This is all to say: There are 

factual, biological explanations 
for how these processes work. 
But in the Hobby Lobby case, 
SCOTUS decided that none of 
this matters: It doesn’t matter 
if your beliefs are factually 
accurate so long as they are 
sincerely held. It doesn’t matter 
that emergency contraception 
doesn’t cause an abortion, it 
only matters that people feel 
like emergency contraception 
causes an abortion. In effect, 
SCOTUS ruled that facts matter 
less 
than 
certain 
powerful 

people’s feelings.

The interview with Gingrich 

and the SCOTUS ruling in favor 
of Hobby Lobby support Oxford 
Dictionaries’ 
nomination 
of 

“post-truth” as the word of the 
year. Objective facts appear to 
have lost ground in the minds 
of many people in our country, 
evident in statements from 
current politicians, but also 
extending back to Hobby Lobby 
and beyond.

What’s 
also 
problematic 

is that this acceptance of 
subjective facts (i.e., feelings) 
as objective facts only seems to 
be acceptable when it’s done by 
certain powerful people (read: 
conservatives and Republicans) 
to support and maintain their 
political interests. In cases 
where subjective facts ought 
to play a larger role in the 
discussion, such as in the 
case of sexual assault or when 
people of color, LGBTQ people, 
Muslims, etc. express feeling 
terrified at the reality of a 
Trump presidency, those same 
conservatives and Republicans 
mock the use of feelings and 
emotions in discussions.

What’s apparent from all 

this is that the fact/feeling 
distinction operates in lopsided 
ways. 
People 
of 
oppressed 

identities 
and 
survivors 
of 

sexual assault, among other 
people, are not allotted the 
same leeway to make arguments 
based on feelings, to have their 
feelings taken as facts, as 
personal realities and truths, 
as are their white, conservative 
counterparts. 
There 
is 
an 

exclusive group of people and 
movements that is allowed to 
use feelings as facts, and while 
“post-truth” 
is 
definitely 
a 

thing with legal and historic 
precedent, 
using 
feelings 

as facts is not accessible for 
everyone, even when it might 
be necessary and useful.

CLARISSA DONNELLEY-DEROVEN | COLUMN

I

n recent years it seems that 
we’ve seen the ideological 
gap in this country transform 

into more of an ideological chasm; 
liberals and conservatives have 
both retreated into 
their 
respective 

corners and appear 
ready to duke it out 
for 
the 
foreseeable 

future. Yet the mere 
presence 
of 
such 

a 
stark 
ideological 

division 
does 
not 

necessarily 
mean 

that either of the two 
major political parties 
are in a position to 
take any votes for 
granted, a lesson that Democrats 
were forced to learn the hard way 
during this election.

Many Democratic strategists 

simply assumed that the same 
coalition that propelled President 
Barack Obama to two terms in the 
White House would do the same 
for Hillary Clinton, but it’s clear 
now that this was not the case. As 
the votes rolled in on election night 
and Democratic strongholds such 
as Michigan, Pennsylvania and 
Wisconsin flipped red for the first 
time in years, many disheartened 
liberals were left scratching their 
heads and wondering how their 
support could have splintered in 
such a dramatic fashion.

If there is one lesson to be 

learned from these defections, it 
is that the party must do a better 
job of appealing to working-
class white voters going forward. 
While the Clinton campaign 
focused heavily on emphasizing 
Trump’s 
weaknesses 
and 
on 

promoting 
important 
social 

causes, the campaign lacked a 
strong economic message, which 
may have inevitably led to her 

downfall 
in 
the 
Midwestern 

states in which she faltered. The 
message of “Stronger Together” 
is certainly a lovely sentiment, 
but it seems to have done little 

to inspire blue-collar 
voters to go to the 
polls, as exit polls 
showed Donald Trump 
defeating 
Clinton 

by 30 points among 
whites with no college 
degree in Michigan, 
Wisconsin, Ohio and 
Pennsylvania.

It’s clear that for 

the party to succeed 
in the Rust Belt going 
forward, it will need to 

craft a strong economic message 
and dedicate a great deal of time 
and energy toward winning back 
many of the working-class white 
voters who decisively swung 
Republican this year. Strangely 
enough, the solution to this issue 
may in fact lie with the loser 
of the Democratic primary, 
Bernie Sanders.

Despite 
being 
defeated 
by 

Clinton in the primary, it’s 
clear that the populist policies 
of Sanders struck a chord in 
the Midwest. By attacking free 
trade proposals like the Trans-
Pacific Partnership and stressing 
the unfairness of the current 
economic system, Sanders was 
able to pull off surprise victories 
in states such as Michigan and 
Wisconsin. As a result, in the 
aftermath of the general election, 
many Democrats have been forced 
to confront the uncomfortable 
question of whether or not the 
results would have been the same 
had 
Sanders 
been 
victorious 

during the primaries.

While 
this 
election 
has 

certainly 
humbled 
me 
into 

realizing that nothing can ever 
truly be known with certainty, it 
does appear that Sanders would 
have been more successful among 
the demographics that Clinton 
struggled with throughout the 
course of the election. With this 
in mind, the Democratic Party 
may believe that realigning their 
platform with Sanders and the 
progressive wing of the party 
offers the best chance to succeed 
in future elections. Not only 
would this shift toward more 
progressive policies aid in their 
courting of working-class white 
voters, but it would also greatly 
aid the party in attracting young 
voters, one in 10 approximately of 
which voted to elect a third-party 
candidate this year.

The 
support 
that 
Sanders 

received 
from 
young 
voters 

throughout the primary season 
is certainly well-documented, but 
the raw numbers are absolutely 
astonishing, as a study found that 
as of June, he had received more 
votes from voters under the age of 
30 than both Trump and Clinton 
combined. The DNC is certainly 
aware of this phenomenon, as 
Clinton did, in fact, shift away 
from many of her centrist views 
and embrace more progressive 
policies throughout the course 
of the general election. As the 
party turns its attention to the 
next 
generation 
of 
potential 

Democratic 
voters, 
it 
seems 

plausible that they will begin to 
employ this strategy from the get-
go in future elections and truly 
embrace progressive politics.

Where do liberals go from here?

J

an. 20, 2009 — The most 
famous people in the world 
are gathered in Washington 

D.C. for what feels like a trans-
formative moment in American 
history. Barack Obama has been 
sworn in as president of the United 
States, and the occasion has been 
celebrated 
with 
performances 

from iconic musicians like U2, 
Bruce Springsteen and Aretha 
Franklin, just to name a few.

The greatest moment, though, 

comes at the first inaugural ball, 
which features the Obamas’ first 
dance as the most powerful couple 
in the free world — the lone figures 
on the center stage as Beyoncé 
sings the Etta James classic, “At 
Last.”

Of course, “At Last” is the 

quintessential first dance song, 
but in this backdrop it turns into 
the kind of unreal moment that 
brings tears to your eyes. Beyoncé, 
Barack and Michelle are all 
dressed stunningly and smiling so 
brightly. I can’t begin to imagine 
what’s going through the Obamas’ 
minds in that moment. Are they 
paralyzingly nervous about what’s 
to come? Are they stunned with 
disbelief? 
Euphoric? 
Relieved? 

Looking at them, looking at each 
other, nothing outside the present 
seems to matter.

At the time, or at least in my 

naïve pubescent mind, this felt 
like a new beginning, like Beyoncé 
was washing away the sins of 
old America with her beautiful 
voice, that we could slowly fade to 
black on the image of the Barack 
and Michelle slow dancing and 
enjoy a happy ending. Now, as 
the country faces an uncertain 
future, 
it’s 
painfully 
obvious 

that this was yet another middle 
chapter — a good time, but still 
a moment undetached from the 
scariest, most painful passages of 
American history. Transformative 
as it might have felt, the Obama 
presidency, unfortunately, did not 
truly put an end to anything.

But regardless of what comes 

next, that breathtaking Beyoncé 
moment set the tone for a 
huge part of the legacy of the 
presidency of Barack Obama: an 
unprecedented relationship with 
artists — especially musicians — 
and a kind of creative credibility 
that no president before him had 
ever earned. Succeeding a leader 
who faced protests from artists 
as diverse as Kanye West and the 
Dixie Chicks, President Obama 
saw and promoted the benefits 
of music in a new way, and his 

administration made connections 
with artists from across all genres.

The 
Obama 
White 
House 

was 
where 
Lin-Manuel 

Miranda debuted the first song 
of his phenomenal juggernaut 
“Hamilton.” Watching the old 
video of Miranda’s performance 
now, it’s amazing how much of a 
novelty it seemed, like he’s a trying-
too-hard history teacher. That first 
drop of “Alexander Hamilton” 
sounds like a punchline. Miranda 
himself looks too young to be 
at such a serious event. But the 
Obama administration put him 
up there and gave the future 
MacArthur Genius and superstar 
a chance.

And Miranda was just one of 

the earliest of the Obama White 
House’s 
immensely 
talented 

musical 
guests. 
President 

Obama 
hosted 
one 
of 
the 

greatest performances of Aretha 
Franklin’s long, storied career. He 
had Prince play a private party. 
He welcomed boundary-pushing, 
revolutionary artists like Kendrick 
Lamar and Janelle Monáe, who 
in presidencies past would likely 
have been dismissed as being 
too “extreme.” He appeared via 
satellite at a Jay-Z festival show, 
and he sang on stage with B.B. 
King and Willie Nelson.

The great thing about President 

Obama was that he approached 
music as a fan, not as a politician. 
He didn’t look for big stars to 
co-opt for votes (see: Reagan and 
Bruce Springsteen); rather, Obama 
truly seems to love and appreciate 
what music can accomplish. He 
organized festivals at the White 
House so he could both see the 
artists he loved and give them 
larger exposure. The dude could 
start singing Al Green at the drop 
of a hat. He was so obsessive that 
he couldn’t narrow down his 
favorites into one summer playlist, 
instead 
releasing 
“Day” 
and 

“Night” versions that, combined, 
would run for over two-and-a-half 
hours.

He even has the passionate 

opinions of a fan. When Kanye 
West 
infamously 
interrupted 

Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs, 
President Obama offered his 
(ostensibly 
off-the-record) 

response: “He’s a jackass.”

As Aziz Ansari said when 

recounting 
his 
own 
Obama 

story, “This dude acts the exact 
same way I would act if I was the 
president.”

As Common remarked after 

being invited to the White House 
to discuss the My Brother’s 
Keeper initiative, “It was myself, 
A$AP Rocky, Rick Ross, J. Cole, 

Chance the Rapper and many 
more in this room, and I’m looking 
at a picture of George Washington 
with the President right there next 
to me, and I’m like, ‘Man, I know 
George Washington never would 
have seen this many brothers in 
the White House!’ ”

As Jay-Z put it, simply and 

triumphantly 
after 
the 
2008 

election, “My President is Black.”

But now, with the impending 

inauguration of President-elect 
Donald Trump, artists for the 
first time in a generation will have 
to deal with a president who is 
not their friend. As a country, we 
have swung from one of the most 
passionate lovers of music ever 
to that guy who says he “likes 
everything” but really just listens 
to The Chainsmokers and Maroon 
5.

Like, seriously, who is even 

going to sing at his inauguration? 
Ted Nugent? Pat Boone? The 
Naked Cowboy? Literally, per 
Wikipedia, those are 30 percent 
of his musical endorsements right 
there. I mean, even Nixon, the 
least cool president in history, still 
got that one weird photo op with 
Elvis. Somehow, despite his recent 
remarks, I don’t see Kanye being 
allowed anywhere near the Oval 
Office.

So everything will be different. 

The festivals will likely cease. The 
Correspondents’ Dinner will be a 
lot less cozy. After an era of good 
feelings, artists will have to fight 
harder to be heard. They will be 
asked to directly challenge the 
Executive Branch for the first time 
in almost a decade. They might 
even provoke direct Twitter fights 
with the most powerful man in the 
free world.

But if I’ve learned anything, 

it seems clear that yet again, 
we’re not at the end of America 
or a new beginning. The Trump 
Presidency, like the presidencies of 
Andrew Jackson, Franklin Pierce, 
Herbert Hoover, Nixon, Carter, 
Reagan, Clinton and Bush, is 
another middle chapter, only with 
a few more pages in front of it.

That’s not to discount the 

very real damage that Trump 
can do, or the lives that are put at 
serious risk due to his election. 
But it’s a reminder that this is a 
continuation, not the end, and we 
don’t have the luxury of stopping 
all that was easier under Obama. 
Artists have seen how good it can 
be, and now, they’re going to have 
to fight to keep that alive.

The musical legacy 
of Barack Obama

Any movie released after Nov. 

8th — which is consequently a large 
chunk of the Oscar contenders — is 
going to be viewed, 
more so than ever, 
through the lens of 
the modern world, 
especially a period 
piece about the fight 
for civil rights and 
especially a movie 
like “Loving.”

Out of context, 

“Loving” is simply 
a story of power — both political 
and racial — being used to impose 
the ethos of one person or group 
on the lives of an entire nation of 
people. It’s about the roots of that 
ethos being grown in the soil of 
hate and fear. But more than any 
of that, it’s about the people who 
are forced to bend to the will of the 
dominant ideology.

Loving v. Virginia was the 

first Supreme Court case with a 
ruling that implied marriage is a 
fundamental right. The marriage 
in question was an interracial 
marriage 
between 
Mildred 

Loving, a Black woman, and 
Richard Loving, a white man. Jeff 
Nichols’s 
(“Midnight 
Special”) 

fictionalization of the case follows 
Mildred, played brilliantly by 
Ruth Negga (“Warcraft”), and 
Richard (Joel Edgerton “Midnight 
Special”) from their engagement 
until the Supreme Court ruling. 
After marrying in Washington 

D.C. and returning to their home 
in Carolina County, Virginia, the 
couple is arrested and forced to 
leave the state for 25 years.

While living in D.C., Mildred 

writes a letter to Bobby Kennedy, 

and 
the 
couple 

is 
contacted 
by 

an ACLU lawyer, 
surprisingly played 
by comedian Nick 
Kroll (the Douche 
from 
“Parks 
& 

Recreation”). 
While a departure 
from Kroll’s usual 
breed of comedy, 

he’s still funny in “Loving,” 
leaning on earnestness rather than 
crudeness for laughs.

What separates “Loving” from 

other court case period pieces is 
its disregard for the legal side of 
things. There’s only one shot of the 
Lovings in a courtroom, and most 
of the legal dealings are handled 
off screen. The scene in the 
Supreme Court is only two shots: 
one of each lawyer delivering a 
small speech about love and rights 
and slavery laws. What we do 
get is an inside look at the lives 
of Mildred and Richard Loving. 
We take on the role of the Life 
Magazine photographer, sitting 
in the corner while they and their 
children simply live.

The life they live is simple and 

beautiful. Eventually, they move 
to a big home in the Virginia 
countryside. Their three children 
run in the fields. They eat dinner 
together and watch TV. Nothing 

about them is spectacular and that 
seems to be the point. The Lovings 
are just a family, living exactly the 
way you’d expect a family to in 
1967.

And it’s a quiet life, quite 

literally. Few words are spoken 
between any two characters. 
Richard plays the familiar, tight-
lipped countryman. He’s gruff 
with everyone but Mildred and his 
children, and even with them, he 
speaks mostly monosyllabically. 
Mildred 
is 
more 
open 
and 

idealistic — two attributes that 
have never been more wonderfully 
visualized than they are in Negga’s 
big, bright eyes. But even she is shy 
and speaks softly and infrequently.

The film’s hush and its turn 

away from the dramatic, hero-
filled courtrooms falls in line 
with a recent cinematic shift to 
the everyday. With movies like 
“Moonlight” 
and 
“American 

Honey” casting away strict plot 
rules and big climaxes, filmmaking 
seems to be trending towards 
structural realism, and “Loving” 
follows suit.

“Loving” is the sort of story 

that makes you say, “Gosh! Can 
you believe there was a time when 
interracial marriage was illegal?” 
This sentence will be repeated 
by our children when they talk 
about gay marriage and their 
grandchildren when they talk 
about some other civil liberty we 
have not even thought of granting 
yet. That’s perhaps what makes 
the Lovings’ story feel at once so 
distant and so present.

TV REVIEW

Thanksgiving is a time of 

overeating, family tension and 
leaving 
your 

childhood bed as 
little as possible. 
“Saturday 
Night 

Live’s 
2016 

Thanksgiving 
Special” reminds 
us of all that, plus 
other sentiments 
that come with 
the 
holiday. 
It 

takes the normal 
Thanksgiving 
problems 
and 
makes 
them 

weirder, more over-the-top and 
much funnier.

The first example of this comes 

about 20 minutes into the special, 
with “Thanksgiving Guest.” Trey 
(Josh Hutcherson, “The Hunger 
Games”) 
returns 
home 
from 

college with his new girlfriend, 
Elyse (Vanessa Bayer, “Saturday 
Night Live”). The family — SNL 
cast members Aidy Bryant, Kyle 
Mooney, Bobby Moynihan and 
Beck Bennett – is excited to meet 
her, but there’s a catch: Elyse is 
a turkey. The blind-sided family 
finds this incredibly awkward 
(rightfully so) given the fact that 
they have prepared Elyse’s next-
door neighbor for the main course. 
The sketch ultimately devolves 
into Elyse breaking up with Trey 
and running out on dinner.

Hopefully 
no 
one’s 

Thanksgiving dinner this year 
actually included their family 
eating his or her new girlfriend’s 
next-door neighbor for dinner. The 
absurdity of the sketch, however, 
highlights 
a 
real 
component 

of the holidays – introducing a 
significant other to the family. It’s 
a scary concept, to bring someone 
new into an established world. 
What if they don’t fit in?

Sometimes, 

the new addition 
to the family fits 
in perfectly. The 
special 
reminds 

viewers of this too, 
with 
“The 
Bird 

Family.” The sketch 
is a visit back to 
what some might 
call the SNL glory 
days 
(late 
’90s/

early 
’00s) 
when 

Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, Ana 
Gasteyer, Molly Shannon, Chris 
Parnell and Rachel Dratch reigned 
supreme.

In “The Bird Family,” Ferrell 

and Gasteyer play the parents of a 
unique family — parents who feed 
their children like baby birds. This 
means exactly what it implies, 
that they chew food up in their 
own mouths and then spit it into 
the mouths of their kids. Add a 
new girlfriend, Karen (Julianna 
Margulies, “The Good Wife”), into 
the mix, and the sketch is a recipe 
for hilarity. Karen ultimately 
embraces 
the 
bird 
feeding 

method and joins the family for a 
uncomfortable, albeit enjoyable, 
Thanksgiving.

Family dynamics can be strange. 

Going home for the holidays can 
be difficult. But it doesn’t have to 
be. In fact, going home can be the 
exact opposite. For some, being at 
the parent’s house is basically the 
same as being a king or a queen.

At least that’s what “Back Home 

Ballers” implies. The best sketch 
of the night is the 2014 digital 

short created and performed by 
the ladies of SNL. Dressed like 
they’re in a stereotypical rap 
video, the ladies (Cecily Strong, 
Kate McKinnon, Sasheer Zamata, 
Cameron Diaz, Vanessa Bayer and 
Leslie Jones) sum up how it feels 
to be home for the holidays. The 
free food, awkward conversations 
with neighbors, childhood art 
projects hung on the wall, PG 
family outings … it’s all there, in a 
delightful rap song.

Arguably the best part of the 

digital short is Leslie Jones’s bit 
about the various bowls which 
can be found at her mom’s house. 
Bowls of potato chips, potpourri, 
M&Ms, seashells, bowls for other 
bowls — being a “back home 
baller” means something different 
to everyone, and for Leslie Jones, it 
means a lot of bowls. 

Ironically, I write this article 

sitting on my couch at home in my 
childhood pajamas, with a giant 
bowl of potato chips while my 
two sports bras tumble gloriously 
in the laundry machine. A “back-
home baller,” indeed.

The 
“Saturday 
Night 
Live 

Thanksgiving 
Special 
2016” 

provides a much welcomed two-
hour laugh during everyone’s 
favorite time of year. Given the 
nature of the episode, it’s not an 
escape from the holidays, but 
rather an excuse to poke fun at and 
satirize every possible aspect of it. 
With over 42 seasons of comedy, 
the annual Thanksgiving special 
takes “Saturday Night Live” ’s 
best, worst and most questionable 
holiday sketches and throws them 
back into the fire.

Didn’t 
get 
enough? 
“SNL 

Christmas 2016” is right around 
the corner. Ho, ho, ho.

ALBUM REVIEW

Brooklyn-based, pop duo Sleigh 

Bells was one of those bands with 
the world at its feet. Songs from 
their 
2010 
debut 

album Treats have 
several 
million 

plays on Spotify to 
this day, with “Rill 
Rill” currently at 
18 million streams. 
They were receiving 
critical acclaim and 
became 
a 
“buzz 

band” — a term synonymous with 
short-lived fame.

However, much has changed 

and now, as the duo enters its 
eighth year as a band and their 
fourth studio album, Sleigh Bells 
keeps a relatively high profile, 
despite waning media interest.

Taking a few years off from 

the 
relentless 
recording 
of 

their first three albums seems 
to have hindered the band on 
its new album, Jessica Rabbit. 
Many 
tracks 
are 
disjointed, 

with overlapping sounds and 
vocals that sit uncomfortably, 
and 
instead 
of 
making 

something complete, it’s all sadly 
unsatisfying.

Album 
opener 
“It’s 
Just 

Us 
Now” 
exemplifies 
this 

discomfort, with a beat that is 
jarringly stop-start and hip-hop 
beats overlaying rough guitar 
riffs. The track doesn’t work as 
well as you’d hope — it’s like two 

individual songs 
were 
written 

and then pasted 
together, 
thus 

failing to capture 
the 
song’s 

potential.

A similar story 

can 
be 
found 

on “Throw Me 

Down the Stairs,” which is an 
angry song with odd interjections 
of ethereal noises and vocalist 
Alexis Krauss’s soft cooing. It 
doesn’t seem to work surrounded 
by the rest of the song and 
ultimately renders it forgettable. 

This is sadly something that 

continues throughout the rest of 
the album. There are moments 
of pure brilliance, often carried 
by Krauss’s amazing vocal range 
and variety. “I Can Only Stare” is 
a definite standout for the album, 
with synths humming in the 
background and the vocals taking 
a forefront, while little in terms of 
guitar appears at all throughout 
the song. The tracks that lean 
toward a more vocally dominant 

sound are the songs that are the 
most likely to stick in the mind.

“Crucible” 
is 
another 

standout. It’s one of the only 
songs that manages to blend 
the experimental sounds and 
Krauss’s voice together, and it 
works brilliantly. It has a chirpy 
sampling that runs throughout, 
perfectly 
blending 
with 
the 

vocals and beats.

“Crucible” seems to be what 

the potential of this band is, 
but it’s only realized in a few 
moments, while a lot of the 
other songs on this album fall 
undeniably into a bland, noisy 
background. Some tracks are 
just shy of the two-minute mark, 
having little impact on the 
listener, and it’s just a confusing 
decision to have them included 
at all. Listening to the album as 
a whole leaves a disappointingly 
unsatisfying feeling of “it could 
have been better.”

There is nothing remotely 

generic 
about 
this 
album, 

which is something to be both 
applauded and considered part of 
the problem. Although definitely 
worth the listen, Jessica Rabbit 
fails to produce anything that 
might draw you back for a second 
listen, with only a few standout 
songs present.

EVENT REVIEW

In 
the 
short 
story 
“On 

Exactitude 
in 
Science” 
by 

Argentine writer Jorge Luis 
Borges, a society 
obsessed 
with 

maps embarks on 
its most ambitious 
project to date. To 
them, maps always 
seemed too small, 
too inadequate in 
representing their 
world in all its 
vivid color. After 
all, why scale down 
when 
something 

is always lost in translation 
when doing so? They decide to 
create a 1:1 map of the world — 
each object, each person, each 
mountain, valley and clamorous 
river would be drawn in full 
detail, mirroring its own exact 
size and shape in the real world.

Spoiler alert: they give up. 

Maps may reflect the world 
around them, but they can 
become worlds themselves just 
as easily — more than plain 
old 
pictures, 
they 
become 

microcosms of the very places 
they are meant to encapsulate. 
Borges’s imaginary project of 
mapping, 
of 
world-building, 

proved too bold. A map can grow 
only so large, the world so small.

Brazilian 
architect 
and 

scholar 
Fernando 
Lara 

approaches his projects with 
similar ambition and scope, 
but also with more self-control. 
A lively, passionate speaker, 
he told the Borges story, and 
several others, at a talk at 
UMMA. Lara remarked with a 
laugh that his work, particularly 
the 
architectural 
“map” 
he 

was here to promote, had to be 
slightly more selective in which 
buildings it included, and which 
it left out.

Lara and his collaborator, 

Mexican 
architect 
Luis 

Carranza, wrote a lauded book 
about modern Latin American 
architecture in 2014 — the first 
ever 
comprehensive 
survey 

of the field. To complement 
their text, now a standard in 
architecture classrooms around 
the world, they designed an 
exhibition, “The Other of the 
Other: Modern Architecture in 
Latin America.” This enormous, 
interactive map of prominent 
modern buildings throughout 
Latin America has made its 
way to Ann Arbor after touring 
throughout 
the 
Americas 

over the past two years, and 
is currently on display at the 
Duderstadt Center.

The story of Lara’s map is 

indeed as compelling, layered 
and labyrinthine as a Borges 
story. 
In 
constructing 
an 

architectural 
map 
of 
their 

region, 
Carranza 
and 
Lara 

didn’t just transcribe the world 
around 
them. 
They 
traced 

architecture 
from 
the 
20th 

century into the 21st, from the 
deserts of northern Mexico 
down the continent’s thin spine 
to the low hem of the Andes. 
In doing so, they charted Latin 
America’s tumultuous century 
of progress and conflict in its 
most noteworthy architectural 
creations, 
and 
challenged 

the 
traditional 
assumption 

of 
Western, 
North 
Atlantic 

dominance 
in 
contemporary 

architecture. 

“We needed to engage this 

North 
Atlantic 
knowledge 

center with our own narrative,” 
Lara said at his UMMA talk. 
“It was a strong desire to tell 
this story from the perspective 
of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina. 
That’s what drove this work.”

All too often, Lara believes, 

the 
story 
of 
contemporary 

architecture is told from the 
viewpoints of Europeans and 

North 
Americans. 
He 
used 

yet 
another 
colorful 
story 

to 
illustrate 
the 
traditional 

attitude: Picture a different 
sort of map, this one reflecting 
not the world as it is, but as it 

was 
conceived 

by 
Western 

thinkers. 
It’s 

a map of the 
classical 
arts, 

with 
Ancient 

Greece 
and 

Rome 
as 
its 

base, the pillars 
holding up the 
foundation 
and 

Europe and the 
United 
States 

at the top as the pinnacles of 
modern artistic expression.

Lara simply doesn’t think this 

conception is true — not now, not 
ever. Not even when maps like 
that were really drawn from the 
16th century onward. Instead, 
he sees the colonial encounter 
itself as the basis for ideas of 
Western 
superiority 
in 
the 

arts. It may have been Europe’s 
encounter with the Americas 
that breathed new life — as well 
as free labor and a wealth of 
natural resources — back into a 
floundering Western Europe.

This same dynamic is alive 

and well today. After studying 
Latin 
America’s 
vibrant 

architectural 
heritage 
for 

decades, Lara feels now more 
than ever that nothing can be 
separated into hierarchies of 
merit, least of all the arts. The 
Americas are an interconnected 
place, and always have been. 
Latin America has never been 
truly separate from America 
— 
not 
architecturally, 
not 

politically, and not ethnically or 
linguistically.

“After writing this book on 

Latin American architecture, 
I no longer want to be a Latin 
Americanist. I want to be an 
Americanist,” Lara said. “We 
share a lot in the Americas — 
much more than we are aware 
of.”

The implications of Lara’s 

work 
extend 
beyond 
the 

Americas into the larger global 
architectural sphere as well. His 
own practice in Rio de Janeiro 
completes 
community-minded 

public projects for the Brazilian 
government — something that 
has dried up as the country faces 
a political and economic crisis 
of unprecedented scale in the 
modern era. Brazil’s mistakes 
and failures in architecture 
and public design reverberate 
throughout a world wracked 
with similar challenges: rapid 
and chaotic urbanization, well-
meaning public works initiated 
by 
unreliable 
governments, 

alarming 
population 
growth 

and the rise of informal housing 
in slums and favelas.

It is the ascent of informal 

living, of the informal city 
existing outside and within 
the 
formally 
constructed 

metropolis, which drives Lara’s 
practice.

“Informality is everywhere 

— it’s a matter of degree,” he 
said, comparing Rio’s slums to 
the shoddy complexes thrown 
up for budding entrepreneurs 
in Silicon Valley. “It’s a group 
of characteristics that can apply 
to urban settlements lived in by 
over one billion people today,” 
Lara added. As his interviewer 
cited, in the next 35 years, the 
world will need to build as much 
new housing as has been built 
in the previous 5,000 years of 
human existence.

Informality in Latin America 

isn’t 
the 
only 
architectural 

phenomenon that has informed 
architects 
globally. 
Latin 

America’s legacy of modernist 
innovation, which sits at the 
heart 
of 
Lara’s 
work, 
has 

the 
potential 
to 
offer 
the 

stagnant architectural sphere 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 

Europe 
new 
ways 
forward. 

Because 
it 
was 
considered 

out 
of 
the 
architectural 

mainstream during the 20th 
century, 
visionary 
architects 

experimented 
with 
building 

styles in Latin America that 
wouldn’t surface here until 
decades later.

“When we look at modern 

architecture,” 
he 
explained, 

“It was tested in Latin America 
before it was built in the U.S.”

Flip through the pages of 

Lara’s book and see. A picture 
of a brutalist concrete building 
seems to be from 1970s Boston. 
The caption below, though, tells 
a different story: 1940s Mexico 
City, perhaps, or 1950s Caracas. 
The last century saw Latin 
America as the playground for 
the rich and famous of the United 
States. Little did they know 
that blueprint by blueprint, the 
region was being transformed 
into an architectural hotspot. 
Today, with the work of scholars 
like Lara, architects south of 
the border can finally get their 
moment in the sun.

This revelation — that Latin 

America has a great deal to 
contribute, in arts and in every 
other major global arena — 
seems comically obvious. But 
its significance has as much to 
do with contemporary politics 
as it does with architecture 
or 
academia. 
Just 
as 
the 

United States has been slow to 
recognize the contributions of 
artists and architects from other 
parts of the Americas, Lara 
feels its present-day political 
developments have generated 
an atmosphere of mistrust and 
exclusion for foreign cultures. 
An internationalist who values 
openness 
and 
heterogeneity 

to 
foster 
artistic 
growth, 

he was particularly critical 
of 
President-elect 
Donald’s 

Trump’s proposal to construct a 
2,000 mile concrete wall.

Lara teaches at the University 

of Texas at Austin, just a four-
hour drive from the U.S./Mexico 
border. It is not just the physical, 
but 
also 
the 
psychological 

effects of the proposed wall, 
as well as its symbolism in 
the international arena, that 
upsets the Brazilian scholar. 
To him, it speaks to the same 
closed-off attitudes and cultural 
hierarchies 
that 
portrayed 

Latin America as second-class, 
and treated Latinos as second-
class citizens, for so long. So he 
decided to do something about 
it.

“We have the responsibility 

to propose things that make the 
world better,” Lara said. So at 
the start of classes this fall, the 
professor presented his students 
with a unique challenge: “We 
have to design the border 
without a wall.”

All fall semester, Lara and his 

architecture graduate students 
have been absorbed in their work. 
Now, the project is complete. 
Their border may lack a physical 
wall, but it is far from lawless. 
After all, Lara pointed out that 
just as drugs and human beings 
continue to pass north through 
today’s 
highly 
militarized 

border, illegal arms flow south, 
exacerbating 
narcotrafficking 

conflict 
and 
day-to-day 

violence. 
Crisscrossed 
with 

a network of humane law 
enforcement facilities and safety 
mechanisms, it encapsulates the 
ideal of the open border without 
sacrificing peace of mind.

The 
President-elect 
has 

offered one possible solution 
to the issue of immigration and 
border control. Lara and his 
students have offered another, 
but many American voters may 
have already made up their 
minds The United States might 
not be ready for Lara’s solutions. 
Just 
as 
with 
modernist 

architecture in the last century, 
once again, it’s Latin American 
thinkers leading the vanguard. 
Skepticism 
and 
reactionary 

views don’t seem to faze Lara; he 
learned his craft from a patient 
crowd, after all.

“We have to think of the border 

this way,” Lara concluded. “We 
may be generations away from it. 
But we must envision it.”

It must have been impossible 

for Gucci Mane — the 36 year old 
Atlanta-raised rapper who was 
just released from 
prison 
in 
June, 

but 
has 
already 

dropped two full-
length albums since 
then — to know 
exactly how large 
his influence over 
hip-hop 
would 

become during his 
incarceration.

In 2012, when 

Gucci was convicted of firearm 
possession, the trap rap style 
that he helped usher to national 
attention had not only blossomed 
into a sub-genre, but by June 2016, 
his less technical, more stylish 
approach to writing lyrics had 
become a subject of emulation for 
countless other artists. Many of 
hip hop’s biggest stars — 21 Savage, 
Future, Young Thug, A$AP Ferg 
and more — seem to have inherited 
elements of their sound through 
Gucci Mane’s influence. Now that 
he is free, Guwop is an ultimate 
gatekeeper.

So what does it mean that 

last week, just hours before 
Thanksgiving and allegedly days 
away from the arrival of Gucci 
Mane’s next mixtape, The Return 
of East Atlanta Santa, the world 
was given 1017 vs. the World, a 
seven-track, collaborative EP by 
Gucci and reigning rookie of the 
year Lil Uzi Vert? It means that 
Guwop is officially endorsing Uzi 
as a part of his empire.

Earlier this year, Gucci released 

a track titled “All My Children” 
that celebrates the success of those 
he has influenced with lines like: 

“Stop the track to tell my children 
that I’m proud of them.” On 1017, 
he’s not just applauding from a 
distance. Gucci is running around 
on a playground in Lil Uzi Vert’s 
colorful fantasyland.

1017 
vs. 
the 

World is a gift to 
the culture from 
two of its most 
eccentric, exciting 
and 
cartoonish 

ambassadors. The 
beats are provided 
almost exclusively 
by longtime Atlanta 
affiliates Zaytoven 
and 
Honorable 

C.N.O.T.E, while Uzi’s erratic 
vocal inflections juxtapose Gucci’s 
classically cold, straightforward 
rhyme patterns to create a tug-of-
war style trap project that blends 
youthful optimism with veteran 
realism.

On intro song “Changed My 

Phone,” Lil Uzi calls himself 
“Invader Zim” because “[he’s] not 
from this earth” while Guwop 
is busy talking about business, 
dropping the boastful lines: “I’m 
signed to me, I’m managed by me, 
shit I feel like I’m pimpin’ me.”

Later, on “Fresh,” Gucci Mane 

cuts deep by calling himself a 
“coke dealer dressed like a rap 
figure” while Lil Uzi Vert is caught 
up on his “Red Gucci leather” and 
“Raf Simons sweater.” Though 
they’re united by hip hop and 
the status that it’s afforded them, 
these artists are orbiting on two 
different axes.

Lil Uzi Vert is just starting out, 

having released three mixtapes 
since 2015. Though he has ridden 
their acclaim to top of his class, he 
is still yet to release an album. Yet, 
despite his rookie status, Lil Uzi 
Vert remains in control for most of 

1017 vs. the World. Gucci Mane does 
not appear on “Today” at all, and 
though airtime is basically equal 
on other songs, those with Uzi on 
the hook tend to be more exciting 
than “Blond Brigitte,” the only 
track on which Gucci dominates 
the microphone. 

There’s something fresh and 

modern 
about 
Uzi’s 
screechy 

crooning, even if it does become 
borderline piercing upon one’s 
sixteenth listen of the EP. When 
placed so plainly aside Gucci 
Mane, a veteran who we have 
already heard from plenty, perhaps 
more so than any other rapper, it 
seems inevitable that Uzi would 
emerge as the main event. Still, 
Guwop’s stamp of approval is sure 
to serve him well.

In the few days since the release 

of 1017 vs. the World, both rappers 
have already dropped new music. 
Gucci Mane released “St. Brick 
Intro,” the opening song for his 
upcoming holiday project, while 
Lil Uzi Vert posted videos of 
himself head-bobbing to a new 
song on Twitter. Eventually, this 
EP may be confusedly bundled up 
in the back of our minds along with 
the 10 or 20 other projects that we 
can expect to hear from these two 
artists.

However, 
right 
now, 
it’s 

perfectly fit to act as a buffer 
between 
their 
more 
serious 

releases, to help boost Uzi — who 
is set as the opening act for the 
Weeknd’s upcoming world tour — 
to superstar status and to further 
Gucci’s online buzz. This EP is full 
of fun songs and ultimate Guwop 
one-liners like: “Pockets looking 
like an encyclopedia / Baseball 
money like Derek Jeter.” I’m going 
to have it on loop for a while; I 
suspect the same is true for a lot of 
eager fans.

Kieffer-Wright keys 
Senior Night sweep

Cliff Keen Arena was abuzz 

from start to finish as the No. 
18 
Michigan 
volleyball 
team 

celebrated its Senior Night with 
a win against No. 14 Michigan 
State. On this emotional night, 
it wasn’t a senior who may have 
made the biggest impact in a 3-0 
sweep — it was sophomore middle 
blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright.

Coming off of a road game in 

which she posted a career-high 
16 kills, Kieffer-Wright aimed 
to use her momentum from the 
previous match to start off strong 
in Wednesday’s game.

“Claire has such a great 

attitude, and whenever she gets 
going, she pulls someone else 
with her,” said senior middle 
blocker Abby Cole. “She gives the 
momentum to someone else. She 
shares that.”

Her success indeed carried 

over to the team as the Wolverines 
gained an early lead in the first 
set and finished it, 25-16, without 
trailing 
once. 
Kieffer-Wright 

helped close the set, scoring four 
of the last five points and leading 
the team with six kills and an 
attack average of .455.

Kieffer-Wright’s 
finishing 

performance during the set was 
met with roaring approval by 
the sold-out crowd in the arena. 
While emotions ran high in the 
last home game of the season, 
Kieffer-Wright held a strong 
mental fortitude that she had 
worked on throughout the season.

Carrying her sharp focus into 

the second set, Kieffer-Wright 
scored the first point to spark a 
17-4 run. She recorded two blocks 
and two block assists during the 
stretch. She ended the set — which 
Michigan won, 25-11 — with a 
spike down the right of the court. 

As the team headed into the 

locker room after the second set, 
Kieffer-Wright’s impact loomed 
large over the game, especially 
thanks to her effect on her 
teammates.

“She’s so much more connected 

to her teammates because she’s 
not in her own mind, and I think 
you just see her maturing as an 
athlete,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “Physically, she’s a 
great athlete, but mentally, she’s 
sharp. She is very in tune with the 
game.”

Looking to make the third 

set the final one, Kieffer-Wright 
entered the court again with the 
same mindset she had at the start.

And in similar fashion as 

the second set, Kieffer-Wright 
opened the third with a kill that 
led to a Michigan run. Her kills set 
the pace for the aggressive style of 
play the Wolverines adopted.

Unlike the first two sets, 

however, Michigan struggled to 
maintain its lead as the Spartans 
tied the set late after a four-
point run. However, Kieffer-
Wright had key plays that kept 
the Wolverines in the game and 
stopped the momentum from 
going the Spartans’ way. Scoring 
the advantage point twice as both 
teams battled for the two-point 
advantage, she relieved a large 
amount of pressure from the 
Wolverines so they could continue 
to be aggressive and ultimately 
win the set, 32-30.

Kieffer-Wright 
recorded 

her seventh consecutive match 
with double-digit kills (12) and 
recorded an attack average of .476. 

“This has been a really big 

season for her,” Cole said. “She’s 
made more of an impact than I 
can even explain. Not only is she 
a team player, but emotionally 
I think she gets big plays when 
they’re needed.”

T

hough many members of 
the Michigan women’s 
basketball team shared 

their 
excitement 
to play in 
the Virgin 
Islands at the 
aptly named 
Paradise 
Jam, it wasn’t just beaches and 
sunshine.

The Wolverines were to be 

tested on the hardwood against 
two ranked opponents, No. 25 
Gonzaga and No. 10 Florida 
State, and Winthrop.

It was a daunting task for 

unranked Michigan. And while 
it’s still too early to tell what the 
NCAA Tournament implications 
will be for the Wolverines, if 
there are any at all, they knew 
going in that they would have 
to at least make the games 
competitive to earn respect.

And they did just that, going 

2-1 for the weekend with an 
upset over Gonzaga, throttling 
of Winthrop and a tight contest 
against Florida State.

Unlike the past three seasons, 

it wasn’t about earning the 
respect of being a worthy 
adversary. It was the respect 
of being a top-tier team in the 
country, and putting a number 
before its name opponents’ 
schedules.

Michigan saw its last top-25 

ranking in the 2012-13 season, 
when it peaked at No. 23 in the 
Associated Press poll during 
week 12 — the last season it made 
the NCAA Tournament. Monday, 
the AP Poll again left them out of 
the rankings with just 22 votes, 
good for 33rd.

But if the Wolverines’ 

performance in the Virgin 
Islands is any indication, it is 
time that their unranked streak 
comes to an end.

Prior to facing Gonzaga for 

its first game on Thursday, 

Michigan hadn’t even received 
a vote in the AP Poll this season. 
So when it met a lengthier 
Bulldogs team that had trounced 
No. 11 Stanford on the road in its 
previous game, it seemed like it 
would be a long night.

But it wasn’t. The Wolverines 

not only upset Gonzaga, 78-66, 
but also outplayed them wire-
to-wire without giving up their 
lead.

Michigan’s three-headed 

monster of Katelynn Flaherty, 
Siera Thompson, and Hallie 
Thome combined to shoot 23-for-
38 from the field and dished out 
14 assists — proving yet again 
they make up one of the most 
dynamic trios in the country.

The Wolverines were 

impressive against the Bulldogs, 
but it was their matchup against 
Florida State that shed the most 
light on Michigan’s potential. 
The final score was lopsided 
in favor of the Seminoles, 
76-62, but for three quarters, 
the Wolverines held their own 
against a top-10 team.

Michigan’s deficit came as 

close as five points in the fourth 
quarter. It topped Florida State in 
nearly every category on the stat 
sheet, but was ultimately plagued 
by foul trouble, getting outshot at 
the free-throw line 34 attempts 
to 11. Notwithstanding the loss, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico sees her team’s confidence 
growing.

“(There were) definitely a lot 

of positives and hopefully this 
continues to motivate us moving 
forward,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think our team is really excited 
about what we have and what we 
can be.”

We’ll never know what 

the score would have been if 
Michigan committed fewer 
fouls, but one thing is abundantly 
clear: The Wolverines look legit 
through their first seven games.

Playing against all calibers 

of competition, Michigan holds 
the fourth-best scoring margin 
in the country (34.1 points per 
game), the amalgam of the 
11th-best scoring defense and 
12th-best scoring offense.

“If teams don’t see us,” 

Barnes Arico said, “they don’t 
understand how fast we really 
like to go, how much we share 
the basketball in transition, make 
extra passes and how we can 
knock down shots.”

Even with a three-guard 

offense reliant on mid-range and 
3-point shooting, the Wolverines 
still have the nation’s second-
best field goal percentage (51.8).

Michigan, of course, 

isn’t perfect. It has battled 
inconsistent ball handling and 
foul troubles — both byproducts 
of a more up-tempo, aggressive 
gameplan. And 14-point losses 

aren’t flukes.

But all of the pieces are there: 

an All-American shooting guard, 
a floor general, a plethora of 
rebounders and a bench that can 
run five players deep. Even the 
coaching staff has stuck together, 
now in its third season.

Thus far, these pieces have put 

together a stat sheet that tells 
the story of a top-25 team. And if 
that isn’t enough, the Wolverines 
have looked pretty damn good on 
the eye test, too.

With powerhouses like 

Maryland and Ohio State in 
the Big Ten, Michigan still may 
be a ways away from being 
conference title contenders. But 
the Wolverines aren’t a walk in 
the park, either, and they should 
garner the respect of being a true 
threat. A spot on a national poll 
would do just that.

‘M’ fined for Harbaugh’s rant

As a punishment for Jim 

Harbaugh’s postgame comments 
about the officiating in his 
team’s 
loss 

at Ohio State 
on 
Saturday, 

the Big Ten office fined the 
University $10,000 and issued a 
public reprimand to Harbaugh.

The penalty is a minor one for 

Harbaugh, who makes more than 
$9 million per year, according to 
USA TODAY. It’s also the Big 
Ten’s standard response to an 
offense like Harbaugh’s. Most 
recently, former Nebraska coach 
Bo Pelini faced 
the same penalty 
for criticizing a 
pass interference 
penalty after a 
game 
against 

Iowa.

Harbaugh 

spent most of his 
postgame press 
conference 
Saturday 
lamenting 
the 

officiating, 
saying 
he 
was 

“bitterly disappointed.” The Big 
Ten ruled that the comments 
violated 
its 
sportsmanship 

policy, 
which 
requires 
“all 

contests involving a member 
institution to be conducted 
without compromise to any 
fundamental 
element 
of 

sportsmanship.”

On the second-to-last play 

of double overtime Saturday, 
on 4th-and-1 from Michigan’s 
16-yard 
line, 
Ohio 
State 

quarterback J.T. Barrett took 
a hit and dove forward toward 
the first-down marker. The 
officials ruled that Barrett 
made the first down, prolonging 
the game, and the Buckeyes 
won on the next play.

“There wasn’t a first down,” 

Harbaugh said, holding his 
hands out and adding, “by that 
much.”

He 
continued: 
“I 
am 

bitterly disappointed with the 
officiating today. That spot, the 
graphic displays, the interference 
penalties. The one not called 

on us on Grant Perry, clearly 
was being hooked before the 
ball got there. And the previous 
penalty they called on Delano 
Hill, the ball’s uncatchable and 
by the receiver. So I’m bitterly 
disappointed in the officiating. 
Can’t make that any more clear.”

Harbaugh also believed that 

the officials missed multiple 
holding and false-start penalties 
against Ohio State. Near the end 
of the third quarter, Harbaugh 
drew 
an 
unsportsmanlike 

conduct penalty of his own 
by arguing and breaking his 
headset in frustration.

An 
Athletic 
Department 

spokesman had “no additional 

statement 
following 
tonight’s 
news 

from 
the 
Big 

Ten.”

PLAYOFF 

PRIMER: 
The 
chances 

of 
Michigan 

making 
the 

College Football 
Playoff 
after 

losing to Ohio State on Saturday 
are very small. We’ll start to 
find out how small on Tuesday 
night.

The playoff committee will 

release its weekly rankings 
to set the stakes for the final 
weekend of the season. The 
Wolverines came in at No. 3 in 
last week’s poll and should fall 
from there after the loss, but 
how far they’ll fall is unclear. 
The slim margin and the fact 
that the game was on the road 
should help Michigan’s cause.

Alabama has been No. 1 in 

every edition of the rankings 
and should be again after 
beating No. 13 Auburn on 
Saturday, 30-12. The Buckeyes 
should stay at No. 2 after 
winning Saturday, making them 
a near-lock for the playoff since 
they don’t play this weekend.

After that, Michigan needs 

some help. No. 4 Clemson 
appears poised to move into 
the Wolverines’ old spot after 
trouncing South Carolina, 56-7. 
The Tigers are heavy favorites 

in 
the 
ACC 
Championship 

Game against Virginia Tech 
this weekend.

No. 
5 
Washington 
also 

scored a convincing victory 
against Washington State on 
Friday. If the Huskies can take 
care of business in the Pac-12 
Championship Game against 
Colorado, they should snag the 
final spot in the playoff and 
leave Michigan on the outside 
looking in.

If they can’t, the door is open 

for another Big Ten team — 
either Michigan, Wisconsin or 
Penn State. The sixth-ranked 
Badgers 
and 
seventh-ranked 

Nittany Lions, both 10-2 like 
the Wolverines, play in the Big 
Ten Championship Game on 
Saturday night, earning another 
chance to prove themselves. 
Wisconsin 
can 
likely 
move 

past Michigan with a win in 
that game, while the Nittany 
Lions will have a harder time 
considering the Wolverines beat 
them in September, 49-10.

All of this, of course, is subject 

to the decision of the committee, 
which is what makes Tuesday so 
important. If Michigan can hold 
firm in the top four or five, the 
Wolverines can hope chaos this 
weekend vaults them into the 
playoff, as unlikely as the odds 
are.

AN EARLY AWARD LOOK: 

Michigan defensive coordinator 
Don Brown is one of five finalists 
for the Broyles Award, given to 
the nation’s best assistant coach, 
as recognition for his unit’s 
terrific season.

In Brown’s first season, the 

defense ranks second in total 
defense, first in passing defense, 
14th in rushing defense and 
second in scoring defense. The 
Wolverines are also the best in 
the country at stopping third-
down opportunities.

The other four finalists are 

also coordinators: Alabama’s 
Jeremy 
Pruitt 
(defense), 

Clemson’s 
Brent 
Venables 

(defense), Colorado’s Jim Leavitt 
(defense) and Pittsburgh’s Matt 
Canada (offense). The Broyles 
Foundation will present the 
award on Dec. 6

NOTEBOOK

“I am bitterly 
disappointed in 
the officiating 

today.”

Calderone reaps benefits of effort

Tony Calderone found himself 

with the puck and a clear view 
of the net halfway through the 
second period of No. 20 Michigan’s 
game against Lake Superior State.

Sandwiched 
between 
two 

defenders, the junior forward had 
merely a split second to get his shot 
off — something he might not have 
been able to do last year.

But this season’s version of 

Tony Calderone spent all summer 
working on his timing, shooting an 
endless number of pucks to speed 
his shot up. He had noticed while 
watching his former teammates 
Tyler Motte and Kyle Connor last 
year that while the duo didn’t 
necessarily 
have 
the 
hardest 

shots, they were able to get it off 
quickly when under duress, and he 
wanted to add that to his offensive 
repertoire.

So on Friday, armed with a 

quicker shot, Calderone took the 
touch pass from linemate Dexter 
Dancs during a power play, spent 
just the briefest of moments 
controlling the puck with his stick 
and threw it on net as quickly as he 
could to beat the Laker goaltender 
five-hole.

It was his fifth goal of the 

year — he would score his sixth 
the following night — and while 
he is now tied for the team lead 
in goals as Michigan begins 
conference play, it hasn’t been 
easy for Calderone to transfer his 
work from the offseason to scoring 
goals. After all, shooting pucks on 
an empty rink is a bit different 
from the real thing.

In order to see the results he 

wanted on the ice, Calderone first 
had to fix his mindset.

“I was worried about making 

mistakes 
too 
much 
at 
the 

beginning of the year,” Calderone 
said Monday. “And (now) I’m 
kinda just starting to relax and 
making some confident plays, and 
it’s worked out.”

Added Michigan coach Red 

Berenson: “We’ve seen a little bit 
of (his new shot). That comes and 
goes with his confidence. Some 
players get the shot away quick and 
they don’t know where it’s going. 
When Tony is dialed in, he gets 

his shot away quick and he knows 
where it’s going. He can place the 
shot, he can beat the goalie with 
a good shot, top shelf or stick side 
or wherever he wants to shoot in. 
When he’s not dialed in, he gets his 
shot away and it might not hit the 
net. So that’s a part of it, too.”

Berenson and his staff had a 

preseason meeting with every 
player, and in Calderone’s case, 
the plan — a vision — was clearly 
laid out: Michigan needed him to 
produce.

Scoring 
goals 
is 
familiar 

territory for Calderone. After 
all, he had arrived in Ann Arbor 
with a reputation for lighting 
up the lamp. In 2012, he was the 
United States Hockey League’s 
first overall draft pick, and in 124 
games between two seasons, he 
scored 53 goals.

That output failed to follow 

him to his first two seasons at 
Michigan, but it seemed only a 
matter of time before Calderone 
broke out. After the departures of 
players such as Motte and Connor, 
Calderone was in line for more 
playing time and more chances to 
display his new shot.

But goal-scoring wasn’t the 

only 
thing 
Berenson 
wanted 

from 
Calderone. 
He 
needed 

Calderone, one of the older and 
most 
experienced 
players 
on 

the team, to show the younger 
players the ropes. So Calderone 
sought to emulate the style of last 
year’s captain JT Compher, who 
Calderone says was “one of the 
best captains ever.”

“(Calderone’s) an older junior, 

he’s probably the same age as our 
seniors, and so I think he’s got 
respect on the team,” Berenson 
said. “... If you’re going to say 
something, you’ve gotta do it. 
You can’t just be a talker, and 
Tony knows that. It’s important, 
if you’re talking to another player 
about, ‘We gotta do this, we gotta 
do that,’ it starts with me.”

It may have taken some time for 

that transformation to take place, 
but it appears Calderone has got 
the hang of it now — and he just so 
happens to be seeing an uptick in 
production as well.

“When he scores, he gets more 

confidence, and then he plays 
better,” Berenson said. “Saturday, 
I thought, was his best game of the 
year. And he could’ve had four or 
five goals, the way that he worked 
hard, he was in the right place 
and the line was playing well. So I 
think it rubs off from what he does 
in the summer. And he’s a honest 
kid. He’s a kid that tries hard every 
day to be a good player, and when 
it all comes together, it shows up in 
his goal-scoring.”

Now more than ever, ‘M’ needs Irvin

If the Michigan basketball 

team is a train, Derrick Walton 
Jr. might be the conductor. But 
Zak Irvin is the engine that 
drives it.

Prior 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 

season-opening 
exhibition 

against 
Armstrong 
State, 

Michigan’s 
senior 
wing 

admitted as much.

“We know that the team goes 

as Derrick and I go,” Irvin said 
on Nov. 3. “We’ve recognized 
that and we know that we have 
to play at our best, be at our best 
— offensively, but defensively 
as well. I think we set the tone 
going into every game and we 
have to know that and we can’t 
have any let-offs.”

It was a refreshing dose of 

realism from the veteran who 
comprises a leadership group 
that has been quick to say 
this season’s outcome will be 
determined by a collective team 
effort. While that may be true, 
the stark reality is that this 
team could live or die by Irvin’s 
performances.

That much showed itself in 

the Wolverines’ matchup against 
South Carolina last Wednesday, 
where they learned for the first 
time that if Irvin doesn’t go, 
then they may not go at all. After 
committing eight 
turnovers 
and 

scoring just five 
points on 2-for-
13 
shooting, 

Irvin was forced 
to watch from 
the bench after 
fouling out with 
5:33 left to play 
as 
Michigan 

swallowed 
a 
61-46 
loss 

against the Gamecocks.

But Irvin rebounded from 

the dismal performance with 
a team-high 14 points against 

Mount 
St. 
Mary’s, 
leading 

Michigan to a 17-point victory.

“You go out there and hit 

your first shot 
and 
it’s 
like, 

‘Finally, 
thank 

you,’ ” Irvin said 
on Saturday. “I 
was 
definitely 

getting reps in 
before the game 
so I was happy 
to see the first 
three went in.”

Added Beilein: 

“I 
made 
the 

correlation. It was like Caris 
Levert’s (Southern Methodist) 
game last year. Nothing could 
go for him. He just didn’t make 

some plays that we’re used to 
Zak making. So I love it. He 
had great energy, he took the 
coaching really well the last two 
days about how he may be trying 
to do too much sometimes, 
about some tendencies that he’s 
had that are out there on scout 
that he’s gotta realize he can’t 
continue to do or people will 
take away.”

The 
pressure 
on 
Irvin’s 

shoulders is nothing new. His 
statement in early November 
was more a ceremonial token 
of 
seniority 
than 
a 
final 

declaration.

After spending his career in 

Ann Arbor playing on a team 
decimated 
by 
injuries, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
outcomes 
have 

been determined by Irvin for a 
long time now. There’s plenty of 
evidence of that, but last year’s 
matchup against Michigan State 
at Crisler Center may be the only 
evidence needed.

Michigan was blown out by 16, 

but Irvin tried to will his team 
over a hurdle by pouring in 19 
points on 8-for-16 shooting. He 
tried to inspire the Wolverines 
verbally, too, storming into the 
huddle and screaming at his 
teammates to wake up.

But now, to say Michigan will 

perform as Irvin does is truer 
than ever. 

While Irvin could rely on 

Kameron Chatman to come 

off the bench in relief last 
year, Chatman’s transfer left 
freshmen guards Ibi Watson 
and Xavier Simpson as the 
Wolverines’ best options to 
back 
up 
Irvin. 
Right 
now, 

those aren’t reliable options, 
as their defensive games have 
left something to be desired for 
coach John Beilein.

“I can’t give the rest — 

tomorrow, they have rest, and 
then we’ll work hard Monday, 
Tuesday with X and Ibi so 
that every day they get closer 
to getting in there,” Beilein 
said on Saturday. “If we’re still 
playing this way in the middle of 
January and February, it’s going 
to be a hard year. These guys, 

we’ve just got to bring them 
along, win games, rest, bring 
them along, win games, rest.”

As 
Beilein 
indicated, 
the 

freshmen development process 
is certainly a pressing one for 
his team.

Through six games, Irvin 

is averaging the most minutes 
played per game on the team 
with 33. If that number holds 
through 
the 
season, 
things 

could turn ugly for Michigan 
— especially given the fact 
that Irvin played 35 games 
after recovering from a back 
surgery last year. Given the 
Wolverines’ injury history, that 
workload could quickly become 
a dangerous test of fate.

That 
might 
not 
show 

up 
against 
teams 
like 
the 

Mountaineers, but the stakes 
are higher when facing Virginia 
Tech or a conference opponent. 
Irvin’s performance in the Big 
Apple showed he has the ability 
to handle that.

Eleven days ago, Michigan 

traveled to Madison Square 
Garden and left as the champion 
of the 2K Classic. Lost among 
Walton’s barrage of 3-pointers 
and 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward DJ Wilson’s dunks in 
the tournament championship 
was 
the 
second 
of 
two 

performances that earned Irvin 
the tournament MVP honor.

Irvin combined for 32 points 

on 11-for-22 shooting and 13 
rebounds, en route to helping 
push Michigan into the top-25 
for the first time this season. 
But when Irvin went cold 
against South Carolina five days 
later, the Wolverines followed 
suit and went colder, losing that 
ranking as soon as they earned 
it.

And with the rest of the 

season ahead, the last 12 days 
have 
made 
it 
clear: 
Irvin 

was right at the beginning of 
November. As he goes, Michigan 
will go with him.

Senior wing Zak Irvin is a critical component of the Michigan men’s basketball team, which could see its fate swing with Irvin’s performance this season.

“We know that 
the team goes 
as Derrick and 

I go.”
