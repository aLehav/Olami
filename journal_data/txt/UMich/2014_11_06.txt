After beinguninvited

By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
Alice Walker, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author, poet and
social justice activist, spoke
to a packed Hill Auditorium
Wednesday night at the 20th

Annual Zora Neale Hurston
Lecture.
Walker's most notable piece
is her award-winning novel
"The Color Purple." She is also
known for her work on social
justice and feminist issues.
The University Department of
Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies and the Center for the Edu-
cation of Women sponsored the
annual lecture, which aims to
honor Hurston, a noted African
American author, by bringing

prominent scholars to campus.
Walker opened by acknowl-

rounding the University's
rescindment of the invitation
it had extended to her to speak
at the Center for the Educa-
tion of Women's 50th Anniver-
sary event last August. Walker
was scheduled to speak at the
event but was uninvited by the
University, allegedly because
donors for the event threatened
to cancel their funding because

of her views on the Israeli-Pal-
estinian conflict.
"As many of you know, it was
not ordained that I should be
here," Walker said. "In its own
way, I think it was divine justice
that I should be here."
Walker said she was thrilled
to speak at a lecture named for

REGENTS RACE
Democrats win
close race for
regents' seats

FUTURE STAR

Though Republicans
led early, White,
Behm elected to
governing board
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
Though Republicans dominat-
ed most races on election night,
a seat on the University's Board
of Regents was not in the cards.
After a long and close race, Dem-
ocrats Mike Behm and Kathy
White, an incumbent, won the
two contested seats on the board
early Wednesday morning.
White led with 1,352,347
votes, followed by Behm, who
received 1,263,196 votes. Repub-
lican candidate Ronald Weiser
held 1,258,361 votes and Repub-
lican candidate Rob Steele held
1,254,325 votes.
The race changed significantly
as votes were counted through-
out the course of Tuesday night
and early Wednesday morning.
As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, Steele
led with 596,732 votes, followed
by Weiser with 594,196. But after

the heavily Democratic Wayne
County votes were counted, the
results flipped entirely, putting
White and Behm in the lead.
White is the current chair of
the board and will be serving her
third consecutive term as regent.
White balances her time
between her position as regent,
as a professor at Wayne State
University Law School, an
instructor of law at the United
States Military Academy at West
Point and a Lieutenant Colonel in
the U.S. Army Reserve.
As she continues her time
as a regent, White's priorities
lie in creating civil discourse
on campus, engaging students
and examining the University's
structural problems.
"Keeping the University of
Michigan affordable enables
students from all backgrounds,
with different perspectives, to
enrich the academic environ-
ment through their engagement
with each other," White wrote in
an e-mail Wednesday.
White said running for office
helped get her in touch with
issues voters are concerned
about.

NOT IN TlH E LEASE
Nothing to squeal about

The student's name has been
changed for privacy reasons.
Two weeks ago, LSA senior
Annie made a new friend, and he
moved in that night. The special
man was Milo, a miniature pigthat
Annie's older brother convinced
her to buy from one of his close
friends.
"I wasn't exactly searching for
a pet," Annie said. "I had before
thought that students who have
pets ... it's sort of unfair. You're
gone all day, you can't really give
it attention, ithas limited access to
being outside andthings like that."
When she first met Milo,
Annie's doubts continued to grow.
Then, she held Miloinher arms;
he curled up in her lap and fell

asleep. There was no going back,
hold for one caveat: Annie lives in a
house with nine other roommates.
"I had texted them in a group
text; I said, 'Hey, does anyone
mind if I get a mini pig?' No one
answered, so I just kind of brought
himhome."
Now, Milo shares Annie's room,
claiming comfortable spots in piles
of her clothes and under her bed.
In the spirit of these maternal
instincts - and honoring Milo's
- Annie took the pig to the Arb
last week to roam free and enjoy
nature. He wasn't as keen on the
trip.
"I was hoping that he would feel
so happyto not be cooped up any-
where, and he didn't want to move

... I was like, 'Seriously, it took all
that effort to get you out of the
house... andyouwanttobecarried
the whole time,"' she said.
Another struggle in taking Milo
out and around is that Annie's
landlord has forbidden pets. She
said the pig has yet to attract
unwanted attention - other than
eliciting more frequent visits from
her friends because of his cute-
ness, Annie said Milo lives in a
fairly quiet and discreet manner,
ambling around her room and
napping for most of the day.
Overall, Annie's really not wor-
ried about getting in trouble. She
doubts anyone will squeal on her.

While YouKnowWatt helps
improve energy consumption at the
individual level, the creators hope
that it will assist in solving a larger
crisis - the terawatt problem.
"Basically the terawatt problem
is if you look at how much energy
the world is consuming and you
look at what we're projected to con-
sume in 2050 - we're on an unsus-
tainable path: huge upward trends
in population, energy consumption,
and 85 percent of energy comes
from fossil fuels we dig up from the
ground," Sherman said.
"This is an infrastructure that
takes decades, if not generations,
to change," he said in a talk about
the terawatt problem he gave at the
Business School in November 2013.
Dean and Sherman are also
focusing on a new project called
Customer Discovery Ninja - which
Sherman said allows entrepreneurs
to do "on-demand, live interviews"
with customers.
The market research tool allows
entrepreneurs to call potential cli-
ents from their Internet browser
and conduct a recorded interview.
The project's overall aim is to allow
businesspeople to make their ideas
more accessible to customers and
get feedback on these ideas.
"Most people think market
research and think ... surveys and
focus groups - those have really big
flaws," Sherman said.
He said he thinks that the on-
demand interview system will be
more effective.
"We do have some customers
with this and we've developed some
traction and we hope to develop
some business soon," Sherman said.
While the pair said they hope
to work again with YouKnowWatt
and the problem of energy con-
sumption, theyare happy with their
current project as well.
"We really learned a lot going
through YouKnowWatt and jump-
ing in headfirst and now we're
applying those lessons in Customer
Discovery Ninja and we can kinda
already see that we know what
we're doing."

Pending projects
near Ingalls Mall
could see 'Top of
the Park' moved
By TOM MCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
With the news of upcoming
summer construction, the Ann
Arbor Summer Festival's "Top
of the Park" series may need
to change its name to "Top of
Something Else."
The Ann Arbor Sum-
mer Festival is a three-week
music, art and culture series
produced as a joint nonprofit
venture between the Univer-
sity and the city of Ann Arbor
since 1984. This coming sum-
mer, however, the festival's
outdoor component, named
Top of the Park, may have to
move from its usual location
on Ingalls Mall due to pend-
ing University construction
plans.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the construc-
tion plans have yet to be sub-
mitted to the University's
Board of Regents.
"To be a good partner forthe
Summer Festival, we wanted
to give them an early alert that
this project could go forward
this summer and to make sure
that they had plenty of time to
explore more options," he said.
Amy Nesbitt, executive
director of the Ann Arbor
Summer Festival, said a spe-
cial search committee is cur-

rently evaluating potential
alternative locations for Top of
the Park. While unable to give
specific details, she said three.
of the four major locations the
committee is considering are
on-campus.
"Since we are a nonprofit
that was co-founded, Top of
the Park could potentially have
great sites to be hosted on city
property," Nesbitt said. "We
are trying to be open-minded
about this as an opportunity.
But historically, there has been
so much support from the Uni-
versity and the University
community that has allowed
,us to do so much that there is a
lot to consider. There are many
University spaces that really
lend themselves well to what
we do."
Top of the Park is known for
showcasing local and national
music groups, performance
artists and screenings of mov-
ies such as "Gravity," "The
Hunger Games" and "The Art-
ist." With a change of location,
however, could come changes
in programming.
"The move will affect
some of the program choices
depending on how big a stage
we can have," Nesbitt said.
"If we have a smaller stage,
maybe we can't do quite as
big of bands or maybe some of
our outdoor exhibits will be
affected."
Apart from the potential
programming changes, the
potential move would also
result in an increase in the
cost of putting on the event,
though admission would still

be free. Nesbitt said cost con-
siderations would be a factor
in choosing the temporary
location.
Additional expenses may
include building new struc-
tures, rebuilding different
booths, altering stage and
sound systems and differing
power expenses. While festi-
val organizers will not know
exact costs until a new loca-
tion is chosen, they have start-
ed a fundraising campaign
to help defray any additional
expenses should the move in
fact occur.
This would not be the first
time that Top of the Park has
had to change locations. Until
2006, the series was held
on top of the Fletcher Street
parking structure between
the Power Center for the Per-
forming Arts and the School of
Dentistry. The festival derived
its name from this original
location: Top of the Park(ing
garage).
Construction on the garage
in 2006 forced festival orga-
nizers to look elsewhere until
they decided on Ingalls Mall
as a suitable replacement.
"What we have found since
2006 is that it is so welcoming
and expansive in Ingalls Mall
with some grass and some
trees and some shade," Nes-
bitt said. "A lot of people really
loved the new location."
The indoor, ticketed por-
tion of the festival, called the
Mainstage, will be unaffected
by the construction.
The festival will run from
June 12 to July 5, 2015.

mentor and inspiration.
Walker's talk focused on the
theme of friendship, examining
the different kinds of friendship
that exist. She also emphasized
the importance that creating con-
nections has in achieving world
peace.
"Friendship is really impor-
tant, and not just between men
and women and women and
women and people you know; it's
important between countries,"
Walker said.
She is a vocal social justice
advocate and explained the criti-
cal potential she believes global
diplomacy can have in preventing
war and other atrocities.
"We in this country are in the
habit of dropping bombs on peo-
ple, dropping napalm on people,
dropping drones on people,"
Walker said. "The only way we
will save ourselves, the water,
the mountains that haven't been
decapitated ... is if we do it as
friends, on aglobal scale."
In her lecture, Walker said the
midterm election held Tuesday
was futile and that the American
political process is not on the path
to actual change. She discussed
her belief in the need for a new
system - one that defies politics.
"I see the political system as
not only born broken, but unfair,
and destined to be unfair forever,"
she said. "If we really want to
have a world that is safe for our
children, we really need to have
more imagination than to just talk
about red states and blue states
and Republicans and Democrats."
Walker characterizes herself
as a "womanist," and believes
this is important in her activism.
DAAS Professor Michael Awk-
ward, founder of the Zora Neale
Hurston Lecture, mentioned in
an interview with the Daily that
Walker uses the term "womanist"
to "signify that gender equity for
Black American women is impos-

against the party of the presi-
dent, thus giving Republican
statewide officeholders a boost.
Gerber also added that the
structural advantages of incum-
bency - such as having greater
name recognition - helped the
Republicans defeat their Demo-
cratic challengers.
Unlike those races, neither
Peters nor Republican opponent
Terri Lynn Land was running as
an incumbent, but rather for the
open seat created by Sen. Carl
Levin's (D) retirement. The out-
come in this race had more to do
with circumstances unique to
their race than common mid-
term election trends, according
to Gerber.
"I think (Peters) was just a
stronger candidate," Gerber said.
"He sort ofwon on his own record;
I'm not sure Terri Lynn Land was
as strong as a candidate."
In Congress, Peters broke
with the Democratic leadership
on fiscal issues on more than one

occasion, which Gerber believes
' could have improved his cross-
party appeal. Exit poll data from
NBC News showed evidence
of cross-party activity tilting
in Peters' favor: 20 percent of
Rick Snyder voters also voted
for Peters, while just 5 percent
of those supporting Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Mark
Schauer also voted for Land.
It is difficult to determine
whether Republican crossover
can be attributed to a negative
impression of Land that pushed
Republican voters away or sim-
ply to a positive attraction to
Peters. Yet given Land's rela-
tively good name recognition
as Michigan's former Secretary

"I will continue to listen and
apply my experience to find solu-
tions to our stakeholders' con-
cerns," White said. "I also intend
to continue to be in close commu-
nication with student leaders to
make sure I have an understand-
ing about their concerns and can
address them promptly."
Behm currently works as a
litigator in Flint and is an active
member of the Democratic Party.
He worked as a volunteer lawyer
for the Clinton campaign in 1996
and created programs to edu-

sible to imagine until we recog-
nize that the lives of Black women
and men are inextricably bound
together."
Walker discussed her opposi-
tion to war and how she wrote a
children's book titled "Why War
is Never a Good Idea." She said
her strong anti-war and anti-
apartheid opinions contribute to
her opposition to the Israeli occu-
pation of the Gaza strip.
During, the question and
answer portion of the event, an
audience member asked about
Walker's view of the conflict in
Gaza, and Walker responded by
again emphasizing the impor-
tance of friendship and empathy.
She also compared the struggle
of the Palestinians with that of
African-American slaves, saying
it is critical that the situation be
resolved.
"There's something about that
situation that is really crucial for
the world to understand," she
said. "If we don't understand
what's happening there, I don't
think we can make it as a world.
It's that crucial."
Another question posed to
Walker was about how people
achieve friendship and peace

commit atrocities.
"I think it's more about com-
passion, that they are such a mess,
and what they're missing in life,"
Walker-said. "I'm not eager to go
to the prom with those men in
that group in Nigeria, but it has a
lot to do with your own capacity
to have empathy for people," she
said in reference to an incident
in April when terrorists from the
Islamic extremist group Boko
Haram kidnapped almost 300
young girls.
Walker shared a few of her
poems throughout the lecture,
including one titled "Hope,"
which she said was dedicated to
humanity.
"Hope that every failure is an
arrow pointing towards enlight-
enment," she read. "Hope to sin
only in the service of waking up."
of State, Gerber theorized that
some Republican voters just
gravitated toward the congress-
man based on policy appeal
In addition to fiscal policy
drawing crossover, Political Sci-
ence Prof. Mike Traugott said
the gender wage gap was also
a deciding factor. Land took
positions against abortion and
same-sex marriage.
"I think especially for women
in the electorate, the Land cam-
paign was at a distinct disad-
vantage against Gary Peters on
these issues," Traugott said in
an interview Tuesday night.
NBC News exit poll data
showed that Peters performed
better among women who iden-
tified as either Republican or
Independent than Schauer did
in his race.
While his victory amidst a
political climate favorable to
Republicans was not the norm,
Peters did say it was a very fea-
sible outcome in Michigan.
"I think Michigan has always
had a history of ticket splitting,"
Peters told reporters at the MGM
Grand in Detroit on Tuesday

night. "(Voters) look at individual
candidates, look at what those
candidates bring to the office and
are willingto splittheticket. That
doesn't happen often."
To find the precedent, Peters
would have to go back 24 years
and recall the electoral his-
tory of Levin, the man he will
replace. In 1990, Republican
challenger John Engler unex-
pectedly defeated incumbent
Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard
by a narrow margin. Despite the
election of a Republican gover-
nor, Levin easily fended off a
challenge that year from then-
U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette, who is
now Michigan's attorney gen-
eral.

Student startup creates product
for infant care and joint pain

Warmilu creators
hoping to find
business in area
hospitals
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
After being diagnosed with
joint disease, Fay Lum-Lee, a
58-year-old resident of Califor-
nia, experienced a great deal of
pain when moving throughout
her day and spent much of her
time in bed. However, Warmilu,
an advanced therapeutic warm-
ing technology created by Uni-
versity graduates, reduced her
pain and allowed herto continue
driving and moving around with
her family.
The Warmilu technology
was originally created to pre-
vent hypothermia in preterm
babies and help them retain or
increase body heat to improve
their chance for survival. The
technology is now also being
used as a non-pharmacological
treatment for adults with osteo-
arthritis or chronic joint pain.
Warmilu CEO Grace Hsia, a
University alum, who completed

her Master's of Entrepreneur-
ship in 2013, created the startup
idea during her senior year as an
undergraduate in the Universi-
ty's Material Science and Engi-
neering program. Hsia said the
technology generates warmth
instantly for three and a half to
five hours. The device - which
is incorporated into heating pads
and blankets - also has safety
features that limit the maximum
temperature so it doesn't burn or
overheat the user.
"We're spreading the warmth
to save infant lives,"Hsia said. "But
we'realsousingwarmthtoimprove
the lives offolks here inthe U.S."
The startup is looking into
applying the technology to a
wearable band so that it can be
applied to joint pain more direct-
ly. For people like Lum-Lee, this
technology has subdued joint
pain and improved movement.
"For a lot of these folks who
have a chronic condition like
the chronic joint condition, that
is amazing, it's liberating," Hsia
said. "That's what we're able to
do: provide this liberation and
continued mobility and freedom
for these baby boomers."
The startup began manufac-
turing the technology two years
ago and made its first sale in the

last quarter of 2013. Depending
on shipping, a warming pack can
cost between $30 and $40 and a
blanket is about $10.
When Warmilu began in 2011,
it was called M-Wrap. However,
at the suggestion of a University
professor, the company changed
its name to better convey its
vision of using warmth to trans-
form lives aroundthe world, and
not just at the University.
"Parents love their child,"
Hsia said., "Unfortunately their
love is not enough to reduce the
likelihood of death in these pre-
term infants. Warmth becomes
the embodiment of the parent's
love for these infants. That's
why we're called Warmilu: it
stands for 'I love you' at the end
of the name."
To develop the technology,
the Warmilu team tested out
the warming blanket in India,
where it positively improved
the health of 20 infants. The
organization is working to
expand the use of their warm-
ing technology and is hoping
to bring the blankets to Detroit
area hospitals.
The Warmilu team used
many of the entrepreneurial
ecosystem and resources avail-
able in the Detroit and Ann

Arbor areas such as the Univer-
sity School of Information and
the Innovate Blue initiative in
order to create the technology
and put it on the market.
Engineering graduate stu-
dent Alex Chen, Warmilu's
chief operating officer, said the
technology is an example of
how science and engineering
principles can create positive
change in the world.
"When you have a social ven-
ture, it means more than just
making a product," Hsia said.
"With startups you're address-
ing a problem with a potential
product or solution that can
be commercialized, but when
you're a social venture you're
looking at some social challenge
that you're looking to address.
There is a problem there that
has to deal with people."
Hsia said social entrepre-
neurship involves listening to
peoples' challenges and under-
standing social issues.
"As a social entrepreneur what
you find yourself doing is not
only trying to develop a product,
but also really understanding the
social systems and the gaps in the
system that are creating social
challenges," Hsia said. "You've
got to have passion for it"

sent to and from Brandon -
who resigned his post Oct. 31 -
between July 24 and July 26, 2013
was denied on the same grounds.
Both requests were made dur-
ing the process of investigating
the circumstances surrounding
former kicker Brendan Gibbons'
permanent separation from the
University for violating the Stu-
dent Sexual Misconduct Policy.
"If you have a government
employee creating any kind of a
document, even electronically,
that's a public record," said Frank
LoMonte, executive director of
the Student Press Law Center.
"If he's writing to other people
that he does business with about
Athletic Department business,
then that absolutely should be a
publicrecord."
The Michigan Penal Code
states: "All official books, papers
or records created by or received
in any office or agency of the
state of Michigan ... are declared
to be public property."
While the penal code does
not explicitly define the Univer-
sity as an "office or agency of the
state of Michigan," the Freedom
of Information Act does, stating:
"All state agencies, county and
other local governments, school
boards ... and public colleges and
universities are covered."
Fitzgerald, however, said the

University is "not a formal part of
state government," and Univer-
sity employees are free to choose
if, when and how frequently they
delete their e-mails.
The University has argued in
court multiple times that it is a
state agency, including the 1994
case of Moore v. University of
Michigan, regarding the firing
of a whistleblower in the school's
information technology depart-
ment. The case centered on
"whether (the University) can be
characterized as an arm or alter
ego of the state," according to the'
case brief. The University pre-
vailed in court on the back of an
argument that it is "an extension
of the State."
"Itwouldbe shockingto insist,
in the face of decades of legal
precedent, that open-record laws
don't apply to a public univer-
sity," LoMonte said. "Michigan
law requires every state agency
to maintain and enforce a records
retention schedule."
In comparison, Michigan State
University's document retention
policies appear to comply with
the law, requiring"General inter/
intra and non-institutional office
communication that deals with
the operation of a campus unit"
to be maintained for two years
before it can be deleted.
"(MSU's) schedule contains
the same two-year retention
policy for correspondence ... (as)
the records retention schedule
for state agencies in Michigan,"

LoMonte wrote in an e-mail
interview.
Policies at Western Michigan
University and Northern Michi-
gan University are also in compli-
ance with the state's document
retention schedule.
University General Counsel
Timothy Lynch declined to com-
ment on the relationship between
state law and University policy,
as did MSU General Counsel
Robert Noto.
The Daily's FOIA requests for
Brandon's e-mails were submit-
ted months before an Oct. 28
report from MGoBlog.com, a
popular non-University-affiliat-
ed Michigan sports blog, which
gained national traction largely
thanks to e-mails allegedly
sent from a University e-mail
address associated with Bran-
don's name.
The e-mails, confirmed as
authentic by MGoBlog, were
deemed by many to be confron-
tational and unprofessional, and
included phrases such as "Quit
drinking and go to bed," and
"Have a happy life." The Daily
could not independently con-
firm the authenticity of these
e-mails.
When the Daily submitted
requests for e-mail archives
of various other Big Ten ath-
letic directors in mid-2014,
representatives from MSU, the
University of Iowa, the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, the University
of Nebraska, Purdue University

and the University of Illinois
responded with offers to provide
the records. The University of
Minnesota, Indiana University,
Pennsylvania State University
and Ohio State University did not
respond immediately.
The Freedom of Information
Act, passed in 1966, states that if
"the public body has arbitrarily
and capriciously violated this
act," the circuit court can award
compensatory damages plus
$500 in punitive damages to the
individual who submitted the
original request for records.
The Michigan Penal Code lists
a similar penalty for willfully
destroying records, a violation
"punishable by imprisonment in
the state prison not more than
two years or by a fine of not more
than $1,000.00.
The University's transpar-
ency, especially at a high level,
has been repeatedly criticized
in recent years. In 2011, The
Michigan Daily published a spe-
cial report detailing the Univer-
sity's high fees for Freedom of
Information Act requests, find-
ing that it charged much more
for documents than comparable
public institutions. Separately,
in July, the Detroit Free Press
announced that it would be
suing the University's Board of
Regents for allegedly violating
Michigan's Open Meetings law,
which requires that public bodies
adhere to a number of guidelines
for public debate.

cate citizens about elections to
discourage voter intimidation in
2004.
As a newly elected regent,
Behm's priorities lie in making
college affordable and accessible
statewide.
"I would like to see the state
of Michigan reinvest in the Uni-
versity of Michigan and in pub-
lic education," Behm said in an
interview with the Daily late last
month.
This year the results of the
regents do not parallel those at
top of the ticket races, despite
what historical patterns for state
boards have predicted.
In 2012, Democrats Mark Ber-
A

nstein and Shauna Ryder Diggs
won the two open seats on the
board and were carried to victory
in partby the election of President
Barack Obama at the top of the
ticket. Republicans Andrea Fisch-
er Newman and Andrew Richner
won the election in 2010 on the
coattails of Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's landslide victory.
Weiser currently serves on the
board of many for-profit and non-
profit organizations, including
the $4.6 billion-valued real estate
company he founded, McKinley
Associates. He stressed his exper-
tise in the fields of diplomacy,
accounting, finance and politics
throughout his campaign and

was endorsed by The Detroit Free
Press in October.
Though Weiser said it was
unfortunate that he lost by such a
small margin, he does not intend
to stop working with the Univer-
sity in the coming years.
"It is what it is," he said.
Steele was the second repub-
lican candidate who ran in the
election. He stressed transpar-
ency in University actions during
his campaign, offering open office
hours for University students and
faculty and posting the check-
book and budget online.
He ran for the board in 2012
as well and was unavailable
Wednesday for comment.

om Bissell is a writer from
the Upper Peninsula. He
visited Ann Arbor last year.

In the wake of
Robin Williams'
death and the
talk of depression
in the artistic
mind, I evoke
his thoughts.

into the Hopwood
Room to see Tom

OMAR
MAHMOOD

Fall means a few things every year: foot-
ball, changing leaves and job search-
es. Recruiting season in the Business
School officially started, and
recently I turned down my
return offer to work full time
in finance. It wasn't an easy
decision, nor a simple one.
The decision required a lot -
of self-reflection. In retro-
spect, the factors I consid-
ered are indeed important to ELI
the broader decisions of life C
in general, beyond just a first
job after graduation. There
were four main paradigms,
four main pieces of advice that went into the
decision. As a senior, I feel it my obligation to
share those thoughts, such that you may too
share some of the introspection as you think
about life, love and the pursuit of happiness.
Climb the mountain to see the world, not so the
world can see you.
There are numerous pressures on us as
students throughout our schooling: financially,
academically and socially. These pressures
generally convey to us a sense of things we
"should" do - whether grandma says you
"should" be alawyer at Chanukkah, or whether
your friend says you"should"breakup with that
girl at the tailgate. Be wary of the "should." The
essence of this nugget is in pushing you to do
things that make you feel personally validated,
not socially valorized. As a Ross student, I felt
like I should do banking, and to have people see
mylogoed-outswagwould be anice perk tothat.
Intheend,the Tshirtyouwearinthegymmeans"
very little to anyone else if it means very little
to you.
Do what you love and like, because nobody's
going to care unless you're doing brain surgery.
As a corollary, personal validation usually
runs parallel to genuine enthusiasm. While I
disagree with sotne ofwhat this quote alludes(4s;
an aspiring doctor, I love and like brain surgery
and people will care about it to boot...), the
message is valuable. Understand what you like
to do. Understand what makes you happy. Take
astepback. Youwill not lastlong, norbe good at,
a job (or a relationship, etc...) that is forced. Do
you, in all that you do. Be authentic and genuine,
inside and out. Idid not like the work I was doing,
and I did not like the person Itwas becoming.
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Now, as you do you, know that there will be

difficult choices along the way. You must take
ownership of these choices. The greatest blessing
of college is that we may choose our path - but
knowthatsayingyestooneoptionoftenrequires
saying no to another. As Dorothy traveled down
the road, inevitably she faced a fork, turned left,
and kept walking. She was forced to see that
decision out to the end. Likewise, appreciate the
importance of the decisions you make - and do
not regret them, nor think twice. Just make sure
you see them all the way through. I said no to
my offer - a definitively left turn where others
might have turned right - and I take ownership
of it. Let's hope I get to Oz.
To know your limits is to realize you
have none.
Finally, the amazing thing about carving out
your own path is how many opportunities will
comeupthatyouneverexpected. Opportunities
are definitely a surprise - if you saw them
coming, they would have just been "part of the
plan." You would be shocked by how good of a
position you are in as a University of Michigan
student. So give yourself some credit, and
perhaps more importantly, some time. Patience
is not easy, but it is a virtue. Doors will swing
open, but only when you walk far enough away
from your comfort zone. And remember, you
can only walk through one door at a time, so
you'll have your pick of the litter. Embrace the
uncertainty. Let it surprise you. Open your
sails, and let the wind carry you. I certainly
hope this one may be true for me as I apply to
medical schools.
So all of this is to say, if you love banking, do
it. Just make sure you're making the decision
because it's what you want, for who and how
you want to be. You're allowed to be selfish on
this one. A career is a long time, and constitutes
a considerable part of your adult life. Work/life
balance exists for those whose work is not a part
of who they are. As such, I would encourage you
to let work be a fundamental part of your life.
Don't think of it as a balance - work on one
side and life on the other. Think of it as game
of Jenga - the entire substance of the shape,
of your being, constructed from both, each
supporting the other. But don't worry too much.
The best thing about Jenga is that, though for a
fleeting moment life may come toppling down,
you can always build yourself back up. And,
your friends will be with you as you do.

I expected a red carpet laid out and
students from The Michigan Daily
swarming him with burning ques-
tions. I'd been in the room a couple
times before, and each time I felt as
if I were trespassing into a sacred
kind of writers' realm, now more
than ever.
Instead I walked into an empty
room, an old round table laden as
always with perfectly arranged
journals that were there for decor
more than for reading. I saw a man
in the far left corner sitting under a
lamp and actually reading one of the
humble writings that had been laid
on the table. Remarkable, I figured -
the first person that I'd seen reading
something from that table was
a writer.
He sat with one leg atop the other,
brows furrowed and the tips of
his fingers on his cheeks. He wore
spectacles of a scholarly sort that
complemented his scruffy speckled
facial hair. Wellbuilt, ruddy, aman of
God's Country. He wasn't surrounded
by agaggle ofnerds who had followed
his work like comic books, and there
wasn't a mike in sight. So I did what
made sense. I walked up to him,
shook hands and introduced myself,
and in a second I was pouring out all
my frustrations to him.
How I'd been struggling with
the same kind of drudge that he'd
described in his younger years -
the anxiety, depression, total lack of
productivity. I'd read in his Grand
Theft Auto article of how he didn't
write anything for years due ,to his
addiction to the video game, and
how he'd spend each night "carpet

Tom Bissell
bombing the apartment," pacing
around as he promised himself that
tomorrow would be different. I'd
been doing pretty much that since my
junior year of high school,though my
distractions were different.
I'd read his profile of one Mr. Jim
Harrison,therenownednovelistfrom
the UP who was read far and wide,
and whose literature was studied by
French schoolchildren. Mr. Harrison
lived a secluded life out in the wild
of Colorado, where the wolves could
be heard howling. He had lived
for a long time with depression
and was never really meant for
school, having left Michigan State
University after years of frustration
with the bureaucracy of the
English Department.
I saw in these writers a charac-
ter that I've always had as well -
depression, an urge to go live in the
wild (seriously) and a disdain for the
system. Tom had left teaching some
time ago. I explained to him the
slumps I'd been going through. I told
him that his writings spoke to me and
told me that far from being a freak, I
was quite a normal writer. And in the
wake of Robin Williams' death, the
matter is even more stark.
Ask CNN medical correspondent
Sanjay Gupta. We artists have always
toiled ina dark part of the mind, and
there is something universal in our
demeanor that puts people off. It is
hard to find those who genuinely
like us. It is easy to believe the world
is against us, and even easier to do
nothing about it.
"People out there just completely
impulsive, breaking the rules,".
Sanjay Gupta has said. In my time
here, I've said things that I shouldn't
have, things that to me are too true.
I've been open about my disdain
for the social justice movement, for
contemporary art, for the utter lack
of intellect involved in studying
for letter grades. But that same
depression, that same compulsion,
is also the neurological font of our
creativity - ask Gupta. Art comes
from misery, and I know that even as
it flows from my pen.
"If I can even call myself a writer,"
I told Tom Bissell.
He assured me I could.

I've always suspected a conspiracy
against talent, but Tom was
empathetic. He talked about how as
an aspiring writer he'd imagined that
the guys that get an article in reputed
journals have red carpets rolling
out for them, before laughing at his
youthful naivete and shaking his
head. I smiled.
I couldn't get enough of him. The
next dayI went to theUMMA to hear
him speak there again. In the Hop-
wood Room, he had played down the
writer's life so much that I was quite
relieved that I was keeping my pre-
med options open. Here was no dif-
ferent. He voiced some more of my
frustrations elegantly well, that art-
ists were not appreciated, that writ-
ing was alost art. That he had quit his
job at a university because he could
no longer guide writing students
into miserable lives. Depressing, but
cathartic. He spoke to me.
I spoke to him again as I was
buying one of his books, "God Lives
in St. Petersburg," one that he had
recommended to me. I told him about
my spiritual journey the night before
with the Hare Krishnas. Something
had made me turn around to their
music, probably a state inspired by
Tom in the Hopwood Room earlier. I
had ended up goingwiththemto their
temple in Ypsilanti and partaking in
all sorts of exotic rituals and chants,
offering petals and rose water and
fire to a statue of their founder. I
met people looking for God, and in
all seriousness I find that, as creepy
as the event was for a Muslim, it was
one now imprinted on my college
psyche for some time to come.
"You know why I went?" I asked
him with a smile. "I asked myself ...
'What would Tom Bissell do?"'
He looked at me, chuckled, and
told me that he would've turned the
hell around and walked away.
As he signed my book, he crossed
out his name and wrote this down for
me in ballpoint black ink, and I think
he meant it:
To Omar,
With my absolute best wishes to
you. Good luck.

A rude awakening

In my naive freshman mind, my arrival on
campus would mark the commencement
of long-awaited independence. Nine hours
away from home, I prepared
myself for living in a bustling
city away from overprotec-
tive parents and - surpris-
ingly - even more protective
brothers. I expected freedom.
I anticipated exploring every
corridor of campus and roam-
ing about Ann Arbor. I hoped MELISSA
for adventurous nights. How- SCHOLKE
ever, as a junior, I realize the
extent of my naivetd. Instead
ofcarefreeexploration, Ioften
find myself ina world fraught with more restric-
tions than I'd ever known in my past:
Don't walk homefrom the library late at night!
Stay in well-lit areas. Avoid walking alone! Don't
go running at night! Don't get too drunk! Watch
your drink at parties! Only drink the ones you've
physically opened yourself! Call somebody when
you're walking! Put your hood up! Pay attention
to your surroundings! Walk in a manly fashion!
If someone bothers you, keep walking and ignore
them! Be careful in parking garages at night!
Always carry your keys in your hand! Don't blare
your iPod in the evening when you're jogging!
Text us when you're back at your apartment!
In addition to cautionary appeals, women
soon introduced me to their personal methods
of protection. My mother continually tries to
convince me to carry pepper spray. One friend
avidly practices self-defense. Likewise, another
possesses aphone app designed to automatically
notify the police if necessary. Another friend
taught me to carry my keys between my
fingers. The freshman version of me - out of a
combination of naivete and perhaps stubborn
pride - mistakenly assumed they were over-
worrying, and I didn't need to follow their
example. Receiving a barrage of catcalls
within the last year, however, has shattered
my foolish former pride. Now, whenever I'm
alone and a random twinge of fear slithers
up my spine, my keys are wedged between
my fingers.
Catcalling, or street harassment, plagues
about 65 percent of women and roughly 25
percent of men - what mostly identified as
LGBTQ - according to a survey conductedby an
organization known as Stop Street Harassment.

Although avideo depictingawomaninNewYork
City receiving about 100 instances of catcalling
within 10 hours was recently released, street
harassment isn't restricted to metropolitan
areas. I've been catcalled both in Ann Arbor
and on the streets of my rural hometown. Every
instance of vulgar commentary has incited
extreme disgust and subsequent rants. Yet, the
most recent incident enrages me the most.
Several weeks ago, after dozing on the
couch while attempting to do some late-night
homework, my roommates insisted I go to bed. I
stumbledup the stairs in a semi-conscious stupor,
flicked on my bedroom light, placed my backpack
next to the window and proceeded towards the
bathroom. As I walked away, I heard someone
outside yell, "Hey cutie!"I looked out my window
to discern where the noise was coming from
and in the parking lot below stood a group of
guys. One in particular gestured to me to affirm
the comment was meant for me and just stood
there staring. Fuming, I shut my blinds and ran
downstairs. Street harassment was an injustice
I was beginningto stomach, but this time, I was
livid! How dare some stranger bother me in the
safety of my own apartment! Is there no longer a
place where one can feel entirely secure?
Harassment isn't confined to the streets.
Threats are invading our homes and our online
presences. Yet, those attempting to combat
these threats and bring more awareness to the
misogynistic ideologies responsible are often
threatened themselves. The woman featured
in the video capturing catcallers in New York
reportedly received death and rape threats
after her participation in the project.
While the sexism and objectification within
media can fuel the manifestation of these
ideologies in real life, women speaking out
against these societal problems are threatened,
silenced, and sometimes, feel compelled to
leave their homes. Rather than threatening
women, we need to cultivate a culture where
women can freely voice concerns about sexist
attitudes. Likewise, more men need to seriously
take these issues into account and alter their
attitudes regarding objectification and sexism.
Until this awareness is gained, some individuals
will consistently question their safety in
every space.

The drop in minority enrollment
on this campus is a national scandal.
The numbers just released for 2014-
2015 show that enrollment of under-
represented minority students is the
lowest it has been since 1970; this
year's freshman class is 3.7 percent
black, 4.3 percent Latin@, and 1.4
percent Native American.
For more than 40 years, the
University has broken the promises it
made to the Black Action Movement
after the movement shut down the
campus in a three-week student
strike demanding 10 percent Black
enrollment within two years. The
percentage of Black students on this
campus today is less than in1973. This
is the new Jim Crow.
The University's admissions poli-
cies discriminate against minority
students by ignoring the reality of
segregation and inequality of our
schools, racial biases in standard-
ized tests and pretending racism
doesn't exist. These policies have led
to broader attacks on public educa-
tion, integration and equal opportu-
nity in K-12 schools, most starkly in
the immediate and rapid degradation
of education in Detroit following the
ban on affirmative action.
The struggle of the Black commu-
nity of Ferguson against racism and
police brutality is the much-needed
antidote to these worsening condi-
tions everywhere in the country.
Students on this campus, inspired by
the struggle in Ferguson are taking
matters into their own hands, and
asserting the leadership of the stu-
dent movement over and against the
inept, cynical dysfunctional leader-
ship of the administration.
We cannot afford to have any more
illusions in this administration. Since
2006, the University has used Pro-
posal 2 as an excuse for the drop in
minority enrollment. But the steady
decline began even before the ban on
affirmative action. There's no good
excuse for this drop. Prop 2 doesn't
prevent the University from adopting
admissions policies like the 10 per-
cent plan implemented in Texas fol-
lowing the ban on affirmative action
there. The plan guarantees accep-

liority enrollment

tance to the flagship campus to the
top 10 percent of every high school
in the state, eliminating the most
biased admissions criteria, stan-
dardized tests, for a large portion of
admissions. The policy has been very
popular and successful. Compared
-to the University of Texas at Austin,
this University, despite its liberal
reputation, is becoming a segregated
backwater. Students admitted under
the 10 percent plan perform as well
or better than the students admit-
ted based on their SAT scores. The
10 percent plan has also opened the
University to poor, working-class and
rural white students who had been
excluded before.
The only reason notto adopt such
a plan is to maintain the elitism,
and the University's prerogative
to do whatever they want with no
public accountability.
As the University has become
more privatized and focused on
the interests of rich donors over
the. interests of the students and
the character of education, the
administration has risen to a new
level of arrogance, hypocrisy and
utter disregard for the minority,
women, immigrant and international
students on this campus.
This administration has a well-
rehearsed routine of saying pious
words about diversity, making false
promises, creating distractions from
the real issues and co-opting and
threatening student leaders. The
recent statements by University Pres-
ident Mark Schlissel at the Board of
Regents' meeting about the Univer-
sity's diversity plan made clear that
nothing has changed on the part of
the administration.
The Daily reported that Schlissel
announced the administration had
"formed a leadership committee to
consider the changes recommended by
the provost's faculty-led committee
on diversity and inclusion ... and the
committee released a report detailing
several potential changes, including
the creation of a strategic plan for
diversity."
Regarding the administration's
ongoing meetings with the Black

Student Union, Schlissel said
"These ongoing discussions are
resulting in very productive
consultations." What?!
Every year, the administration
creates another committee to
work on minority enrollment or
campus climate or sexual assault
awareness, and they are always the
same: 'Diversity Blueprints,' 'Expect
Respect,' and now'Change It Up' and
the 'Inclusive Language Campaign,'
the committee for 'student input'
regarding renovations to the Trotter
Multicultural Center and the decade-
long search for a more central
location for the building.
It's time to cut the crap. WE
DON'T WANT ANY MORE COM-
MITTEES. As long as the number of
minority students continues to drop,
racism on campus will increase. As
long as the administration covers
up rape instead of punishing the
rapists, the real message will be
clear that rape goes unpunished on
this campus, and incidents of rape,
sexual assault and harassment will
continue to be rampant on this cam-
pus, no matter how many sexual
assault-training programs students
are forced to attend.
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
THAN WORDS. If you are tired
of the administration's worn-out
lies, broken promises and endless
failed committees; if you have been
raped or been the victim of racist
or sexist attacks or harassment on
this campus, and want to fight for
real justice, come speak out at our
public tribunal on hostile campus
climate this Friday at 7 p.m. in the
Henderson room in the Michigan
League. It's time to take matters into
our own hands, to build the power
of the student movement to win
real justice, equality and dignity
for everyone.

EVENT SPOTLIGHT: Rude Mechanicals' Othello CAMPUS
By Emilie Plesset, Weekend Roundup Editor I Photos by Rita Morris, Daily Staff Photographer

"Othello."
Rather than performing the
play in its traditional 17th-
century setting, LSA junior
and "Othello" director Clare
Brennan hopes to emphasize
the play's dynamic characters
by creating a
more modern -
background to
deemphasize "W e're
the distraction
of a historical our owi
setting.
Brennan said
the modernized
setting makes
the play's
symbolism and themes more
visible.
"We're creating our own
world where it exists," she said.
"I've put myself into it and dug
really deep into the themes of
the show and how they wrap
themselves in there."
The Shakespearean tragedy
examines the destructive
nature of jealousy and suspicion
through its main character,
Othello, a Moorish general
in Venice, as his deceitful
relationship with Iago, an
envious solider and rival, ruins

"This play really stuck out
as something that connected
to me as a student and as a
young person," Brennan said.
"Especially the way it wraps
up in the end, it very much is
left hanging. A lot of it is very
much in, the
audience's

Brennan
said she
thinks the
play's themes
of jealousy and betrayal as well
as the conflict of love versus lust
will resonate with students.
"It is really a play that asks us
a lot of direct questions about
instances in your life," Brennan
said. "We've all been through
something like this and it kind
of puts it on us a little bit."
In addition to performing a
Shakespearean play in the fall,
Rude Mechanicals will perform
a contemporary piece during
winter semester. The theatre
group has yet to choose next
semester's play.

to do this
weekend

By JACLYN NAGEL
Daily Weekend Contributor
We've been at school for
over two months now, and
you're probably tired of frat
parties and Netflix mara-
thons. Or maybe you're not.
Either way, you should still
try to do something new this
weekend. If you don't like it,
I promise you can go back to
your smelly fraternity base-
ments next weekend. But
wouldn't youlike more memo-
ries besides barhopping when
you leave after graduation?
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 7
Take advantage of these
last few days of fall (and
above-freezing temperatures)

by visiting a local cider mill.
Pretty soon all of them will be
shutting down for the winter,
so go and get your last fix of
fall pictures and homemade
donuts before it's too late' If
you're lucky, maybe they will.
even have roasted almonds
for sale.
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8
This Saturday night, the
State Theatre will be showing
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch"
at midnight. Though I know
next to nothing about the
movie, I do know that seeing a
midnight movie in Ann Arbor
is on my bucket list.
Take this opportunity to
cross it off of yours, consid-
ering you're probably still

recovering from Halloweek
anyway. Plus, midnight mov-
ies are only $7, which is defi-
nitely a win when you're as
broke as I am.
SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 9
In case you can't go a week
without football, ditch cam-
pus for the day and head
down to Ford Field. The
Detroit Lions will be playing
the Miami Dolphins and it is
sure to be a fun day in the D.
BONUS: Ford Field is indoors
so you won't turn into a walk-
ing popsicle like at the Big
House last weekend. Maybe
you'll even get to celebrate a
win, a feeling that we Michi-
gan students are slowly start-
ing to remember.

WeekendRoundupEditor
When I tell people I play for
I the Michigan Quidditch team,
people typically roll their eyes
or giggle. Then the two big
questions follow: "Who's the
snitch?" and "Do you fly?"
The snitch is a runner who
is trained to tackle, backpedal
and defend a ball hanging by
a Velcro strap at all costs - it
ends the game, and one mis-
step could end a team's season.
The brooms don't fly, but
are still between players' legs
anyway. They're PVC pipes
that are lightweight, sleek and
don't draw all the attention
and questionable looks that an
actual broom would.
It seems funny to envision
running around while hold-
ing a broom and trying to
score a semi-deflated volley-
ball by throwing it through a
set of three hoops staked in
the ground. But it's possibly
the most fun I've ever experi-
enced.
And some may think that
the players don't take it very
seriously, since it's neither a
club nor a varsity sport.
But we put just as much

heart into it as anyteam would,
and we exhibit just as much
commitment to improving our
skills.
We love winning, we love
the celebration that follows a
snitch catch, and we want to
bathe in that glory this week-
end when we travel to Grand
Rapids for our regional Mid-
west Cup.
For many teams, this week-
end means a bid to the Quid-
ditch World Cup VIII in April.
Being held in Rock Hill, S.C.,
the World Cup is an inter-
national event that draws
thousands of spectators and
includes the best 80 teams.
But it's not an easy road.
The game is more physical and
grueling than most are led to
believe. Quidditch is a full-con-
tact sport. At the World Cup,
the stakes are higher, and play-
ers don't mess around as many
are vulnerable to injuries.
But like any other sport,
there are rules to keep players
safe - you can't wrap around
the neck, you can't infringe
upon a defenseless player and
you can't lead with your shoul-
der when making a collision.
As a result, the rate of injuries
has decreased through the

years with better officiating.
As an unpredictable and
natural aspect of sports, inju-
ries don't detract from how fun
it is to play the game. We have
an elaborate playbook of calls
for use during games, we have
to think on our feet to make
smart choices and we have
phenomenal talent all around.
Additionally, the social aspect
of meeting people with diverse
interests and backgrounds
makes being a partofthe group
all the more meaningful.
Aside from playing, the
Quidditch team does a lot for
the community. To try and
spread the enjoyment of the
game, the team attends birth-
day parties to teach younger
kids how to play. Quidditch
also hosts a Yule Ball every
winter semester, which draws
more than 300 students.
Quidditch may always
have the reputation of being
an imaginary game from
J.K. Rowling's "Harry Pot-
ter" series. But the real-life
adaptation has been gradually
garnering the respect it has
desired and deserved.
And for those who give it a
try, it can be much more than
words on a page.

Peppers to receive redshirt

Senior defender Ben Manko scored his first goal of the season on Senior Night, but it wasn't enough to topple the Buckeyes.

ManagingSports Editor
Anyone who watched the
Michigan football team's
season opener against
Appalachian State knows what
it was missing without Jabrill
Peppers.
The freshman made his
first career start against the
Mountaineers, recording a pair
of tackles at nickel back. But the
former five-star recruit dazzled
the crowd most with an electric
punt return in which he eluded
several would-be tacklers.
But that return went for just
six yards.
It was that kind of season
for Peppers - not that it was
much of a season at all. He
certainly would have starred on
the Wolverines' secondary and
punt-return unit, but each time
he got a sniff at stardom, injuries
forced him back to the bench.
Peppers suffered an apparent
ankle injury that afternoon
against the Mountaineers
and hurt his leg again before
Michigan's Sept. 27 game
against Minnesota.
Wednesday, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke officially
announced Peppers will take
a redshirt this year. Hoke said
Peppers will "be in good shape"
in four to five weeks, and should
have no issues returning full-
speed for spring practices. The
injury won't need surgery.
"I've talked with his mother,
talked to doctors, trainers
and everybody that should be
included in the conversation
(about redshirting)," Hoke
said. "He's taking care of
himself. He's been great with

treatments, great with rehabs 12 touchdowns and surrendered

The combination of Senior
Night, a rivalry and a legitimate
chance for both teams to earn
a top-four finish in the Big Ten
gave U-M OHIO STATE 2
Soccer M
Stadium
a festive
atmosphere before the Michigan
men's soccer team's pivotal
match against Ohio State on
Wednesday night.
But less than 30 seconds from
the opening whistle, the mood
changed dramatically.
Straight from the kickoff, the
Buckeyes found space down the
right flank, and a cross fell to
forward UDnny Jensen 12 yards
out, where he slotted his shot
past fifth-year senior goalkeeper
Adam Grinwis. Twenty-six
seconds in to the biggest game
of their season, the Wolverines
trailed.
Although Michigan leveled
the score later in the first half,
it was the Buckeyes (5-3 Big
Ten, 8-6-4 overall) who shocked
the Wolverines with a late goal
in the 85th minute. Ohio State
secured a 2-1 victory over its
biggest rivals and the coveted
spot in the top four of the Big
Ten.
Michigan came into the
match full of confidence and
hope. It had just defeated
in-state rival Michigan State
and was finally playing the kind
of soccer Michigan coach Chaka
Daley envisioned.

The Wolverines also had a
complicated scenario in which
theycouldclinchatop-fourfinish
in the Big Ten, guaranteeing a
home game to open next week's
conference tournament. But
when Michigan State's 3-2
victory over No. 2 Indiana went
final midway through the first
half, Michigan's goal became
very simple: beat Ohio State.
That task, however, would prove
much more difficult.
The early goal registered
as a shock to their system, but
the Wolverines (3-3-2, 6-8-3)
responded with perhaps their
most exciting and attacking half
of soccer this season. The rest
of the first half was played at
a frenetic pace, with plenty of
chances for each team.
"Conceding 30 seconds in is
never a good thing," Daley said.
"I think we had to exert quite a
bit of energy to get back, but I
think we did that effectively."
The Wolverines got a prime
chance for an equalizer in
the 30th minute, when senior
midfielder Marcos Ugarte cut
in from the left side and went to
the ground in the box, earning a
penalty. But much to the dismay
of the home crowd, fifth-year
senior Tyler Arnone's penalty
was stopped by a diving save
from Buckeye goalkeeper Alex
Ivanov.
However, on the ensuing
corner, the Wolverines found
their much-needed goal from an
unlikely source. Senior defender
Ben Manko found himself on
the end of an inch-perfect cross

from Ugarte, and Manko -
looking very much like a lifelong
forward - scored the first goal
of his Michigan career.
"(Ugarte) put ina great corner
kick, I got up and scored the goal
... (it was) an unreal feeling,"
Manko said. "But (I was) a little
disappointed not to get the win
at the end of the day."
The second half proved more
difficult for Michigan. Grinwis
made a pair of spectacular saves
to keep the teams level, but
the Wolverines were unable to
create many good chances.
The decisive goal came in the
85th minute, when Ohio State
midfielder Christian Soldat
curled a shot past two sliding
defenders. Grinwis seemed to
anticipate a deflection, took a
step in the wrong direction and
could only watch as the ball
slowly rolled into the net.
The loss, then, ultimately
represented a chance
squandered.
"We found out (about
the Michigan State result)
at halftime," Daley said.
"Unfortunately, we got the
wrong end of it by not getting
the result tonight."
With Wednesday night's
result, the Wolverines will have
to play on the road for the entire

first round, they find themselves

Nearly 19 minutes in to extra
time, Minnesota midfielder
Josee Stiever gained possession
in the
18-yard MINNESOTA 1
box after a MICHIGAN 0
defensive
scramble and failed clearance
by Michigan. Before a
Wolverine defender could get
to her, Stiever lofted the ball to
the back post, where midfielder
Taylor Winn Wodnick headed
it across the goal line.
That goal, scored in the final
minute of double overtime,
sent the Michigan women's
soccer team home packing with
a heartbreaking loss to the
Golden Gophers on Wednesday
night in the quarterfinals
of the Big Ten Tournament.
The Wolverines entered the
tournament the Big Ten's No. 3
seed, while the Golden Gophers
were No. 6.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
was quick to emphasize that
the goal was not representative
of the team's defensive
performance as a whole.
"(The defense) was
outstanding, I think it was one
of the best performances of the
year," Ryan said. "They kept
I

Minnesota under pressure the
entire game. You know, the
one chance fell to them, and it
was a perfect cross and an easy
header."
However, it was Michigan's
offense that struggled to create
chances throughout the game,
and it appeared the match
would end in a stalemate as
both teams battled evenly
throughout.
"I think both offenses were
struggling," Ryan said. "Neither
team created great chances to
score. I thought Minnesota's
defense was very, .very good.
We just weren't able to get open
for an easy shot."
Michigan's best
opportunities to score came
in the second half, when
sophomore forward Nicky
Waldeck was on the ball often
and catalyzed the attack against
Minnesota's back line. While
Waldeck had only one shot
on goal, it was her precision
passing that resulted in some of
Michigan's best opportunities.
Ryan emphasized that
playing the ball through
Waldeck was a tactical strategy
that the Wolverines were trying
to employ.
"(Minnesota) leaves those
spaces in the flank areas, there
is a big pocket out there," Ryan

said. "Our game plan from the
very beginning was to try to
find Nicky in that space and to
attack from there."
The Wolverines now beging
the anxious waiting period in
anticipation of their postseason
fate. But Ryan was optimistic
about his team's chances of
earning an at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament.
"It's up to the committee,"
Ryan said. "If-you look at the
Big Ten and the number of
teams they are going to take,
I think Michigan is in a great
position. We're going to come
back and recover, and then
train like we're preparing for
the first round of the NCAA
Tournament."
But Ryan was quick to
dismiss the defeat as a
hindrance to the Wolverines'
success if they receive a bid to*
the NCAA Tournament.
"The team morale has been
fantastic all year whether
we have won or lost," Ryan
said. "We've had no problems
getting motivated for that next
game. We're getting ready for a
second season now."
The first round of the NCAA
tournament will begin Nov.
14, and the Wolverines hope to
have the opportunity to break
some hearts of their own.

THE BEST PROFESSIONAL PIERCING SHOP IN A2

When I arrive at the address
Kenny gave me, I expect to find
him sharpening hooks or assem-
bling rigging. Instead, a clean-
shaven father and his two young
sons are packing up a haunted
house Halloween

vious night. Bon
Jovi's "Living on a

the PA; a fondue

corner; it smells like

father yells. I guess
I'm early.

The importance
of being
Kendall Jenner

NETFLIX PIX
Daily Arts Writers dig through recent Netflix releases to
find the movies worth revisiting or discovering.

I*a

This past Monday,
Kendall Jenner,
heir to the Kar-
dashian celebrity throne and
Bruce Jenner's middle part,
turned 19.
Media out-
lets from
Vogue to
Cars Delev-
ingne's
Instagram
joined in.
wishing ERIKA
her a happy HARWOOD
birthday -
something
that, years
ago, would have raised many
a bold, well-groomed eye-
brow.
I've avoided the topic of
Kendall's quick rise to her
spot in today's fashion oligar-
chy mostly because I've been
the sole cause of the Daily's
saturation in all things
Kardashian. I even delayed
writing this column because
"Kourtney & Khloe Take the
Hamptons" was on and I des-
perately needed to understand
why Khloe was dating French
Montana (I still don't - name
one redeeming quality, Khloe).
And for a while - a long while
- I didn't think Kendall was
going to be that big of a deal.
Obviously, I was wrong.
It's not that Kendall's "It
Girl" status comes as a total
surprise. There's a solid per-
centage of people in the enter-
tainment industry who got
their shot at fame just because
they're the spawn of other
celebrities. Celebrities have
bred talents in their own right,
people like Stella McCartney,
Angelina Jolie, Rashida Jones
and Sofia Coppola. Stars who
have developed their careers
and personas to the extent that
you no longer associate them
with the reason they're on this
earth - even if you share a last
name with that reason and that
last name is "McCartney."
But seven years ago - when
"Keeping Up with the Kar-
dashians" first premiered, and
Kim could barely land her own
gigs outside of QuickTrim ads
and Kendall was a mute, awk-
ward 12-year-old - the idea of

"The Birdcage"
One of the greatest films to remember Robin Wil-
liams by, "The Birdcage" is a testament to the pain
and hilarity of family dynamics. Armand Goldman
(Robin Williams, "The Face of Love"), a gay drag
club owner, and his partner Albert (Nathan Lane,
"The English Teacher") receive bignews when their
son Val (Dan Futterman, "A Mighty Heart"), comes
home from college, engaged to be married. A prob-
lem quickly materializes when Val elucidates the
identities of their in-laws - an ultra-conservative
Senator and his uptight wife. To appease his fian-
cee's parents, Val asks his parents to lie, playing it
straight for a night. Williams's performance illus-
trates his deadpan abilities to perfection in between
delivering gag lines and prat falls. This film will
make you laugh and think, as it draws upon serious
issues of conformity and gay rights, conveyed by a
fabulous Nathan Lane in tights and pearls.

"The FP"
"The FP" is a highly original indie film that's
as low-budget as it is entirely bizarre. In the near-
future, gang warfare is perpetrated through Dance
Dance Revolution multiplayer battles (well, they
didn't get the rights to DDR - in this, it's Beat Beat
Revelation. Yeah.) after which the loser collapses
and dies for an unexplained reason. It's a smirking
comedy, one that knows exactly how ridiculous its
premise is and milks that fact. Perhaps the most
interesting part of this filmis its visionof the future
of American English. Words are slurred together
and abbreviated. Gangster slang and racial epi-
thets have become staples of speech, but have
taken on strangely positive connotations ("nigga"
now stands for Never Ignorant of Getting Goals
Achieved). The film is horribly paced and, well,
kind of a mess in general, but it's worth checking
out for its ludicrous subject matter alone.
All the heart, all the excitement
of a great frontier adventure

me, it's still the standout
of that season. The bold
ted colors, the clone-like
gyny of the models, Jes-

Harwood has just coined the
phrase 'nip-tastic.' To congratulate
her, e-mail erikacat@umich.edu.

"Old Yeller"
"Old Yeller was a mongrel, a ugly lop-eared mon-

The song harkens back to younger days, when we
read allthe old dogstories in Mrs. Brooks's fifth grade
class - Where the "Red Fern Grows," "Shiloh" and,
of course, "Old Yeller."
The movie yearns for the idyllic life of the Old
Texan West, a life where a young man can grow up
not knowing what money is, save maybe the Con-
federate dollar that Papa used to have. Even more
charming is the antiquated acting, the old Southern
accent and country speech - "He ain't an ugly yeller
dog, he's a pretty yeller dog!"

to childhood and love, it is a story that has moved

PANGEA
From Page 1B
Still, why would someone
want that - to look like that?
Most of mainstream society
can't wrap its head around it.
"You ready to do this?"
"For sure," I say and nod
way too confidently.
Pangea's three piercing
rooms are small square inlets
without doors. I lay on my
back on an orange operating
table. I stretched my head to
the side while Kenny handled,
through two pairs of sterile
rubber gloves, a sharp pierc-
ing needle.
Kenny seems confident, and
it's just my lobes. Lobes are
allowed.
"When you're ready, take a
deep breath in. I'll pierce on a
slow exhale."
Two weeks later, with the
leaves turning fiery, I went to
Kenny's house in Ypsilanti to
interview him about piercing
culture.
His apartment is in a brick
block building. Out front, a
Styrofoam cup was caught
in the green hedges. With-
out plugs, Kenny's lobes
were wrinkled and stringy.
He wore long black Dickies
shorts. The same cat from his
business card eyes me.
"I see what you did there.
What's its name?"
"Blinka."
Blinka clawed the wall.
A PlayStation 4 rested on a
vacuumed carpet; Next to the
TV, a cinderblock bookcase
filled with Horror novels, and
then next to that, two display
cases, one with jewelry and
the other with trinkets and a
Kiss doll. We sat on the couch.
Kenny said his foray into
piercing was like the next
kid's. When he was six, he
asked his mom if he could get
his ears pierced. After some
coaxing, she agreed, but qual-
ified it was a one-time thing.
She took him to the local mall
in College Station, Texas,
and the boy left with holes in
lobes, face glowing.
He was hooked, and started
experimenting. He pierced
himself, pierced his friends -
first just ears, then noses and
lips.
"We were all putting holes
in each other."
His parents eventually
caught on and were startled
a bit by their son's offbeat
hobby. They told him to take
out the jewelry, but Kenny
was in his teenage-rebel
phase. "I was grounded a lot
in high school."
Six months out of high
school, in 2001, Kenny took
a job the counter of the local
piercing shop. He was even-
tually offered a two-year
apprenticeship, but the shop
went bust six months later.
He moved to Houston in 2007
and eventually finished his
apprenticeship at the well-
regarded Taurian Piercings &
Metals. When Taurian closed

in 2010, he moved to Ypsilanti
to work at Pangea.
As Blinka snuggled into
Kenny's lap, I asked him what
a piercing career at Pangea is
like.
"It can be stressful, man."

As one of two main piercers
at the shop, Kenny's paid $80
minimum per day, or $20 per
piercing, plus tips.
"A slow month is two-thou-
sand to twenty-five-hundred
dollars, a busy month, four to
five-thousand," he said
Doing 20 to 30 piercings a
day can be extremely stressful
though.
"You're trying to get
through stuff fast and in a
precise manner, and at the
same time you have people
waiting for you in the lobby."
Impatient moms are worst:
"Sometimes you wait hours,
I'll be honest. But do you really
want me to rush through this
shit nonchalantly and poten-
tially fuck up your daughter
because you don't have the
patience? ... Not being able to
sleep for a couple days is not
fun."
Blinka jumped down and
up onto an elaborate cat bun-
galow. Kenny broke a small
smile.
"I have this job where I can
make people happy on a daily
basis. I can change someone's
life. It makes me all warm and
tingly inside." The sentence
looked ironic on the guy.
We laughed and I caught
sight of his lizard tongue
(inspired, he said, by Lizard
Man, a dude who's undergone
hundreds of hours of body
modification to look like his
favorite reptile.)
"I fucking stab people for a
living. If someone was walk-
ing down the street and poked
me with a needle they would
go to jail. People pay me to do
that."
There's something incon-
gruous about this status quo.
Most people don't want to
look like Kenny. We likely
haven't dated someone nor
have friends that look like
Kenny. Worse, no matter our
claimed liberalism, we likely
hold ingrained stereotypes
of people like Kenny. Why
else is it that we don't want
our doctors looking like
Kenny? That Kenny has lost
girlfriends after being intro-
duced to their families?
"Some were more accept-
ing, but for the most part it's
been bad experiences."
When mainstream soci-
ety experiments, we try OJ
with pulp, paint the bedroom
salmon, maybe go bungee
jumping. Just simple studs in
my lobes will do, please and
thank you. Why would any-
one want so many holes in
their body? Or suspend their
body via shark hook?
I was playing with my studs
again, twirling the moon-
stones in their holes, when I
realized the same applied to
me. I like how my earrings
looked, but I still don't know
if my more traditional par-
ents will approve of my pierc-
ings. Them to Me to Kenny to
Lizard Man is just a matter of
degrees of judgment.
"It's your own fault for not
being able to even give it a try
and see what I'm like," Henny
said. "I don't care though,

miss out on whatever you
want. It doesn't really affect
me."
"Don't let me know if body
fat pops out this time. I didn't

need to know that last time,"
John says.
From behind a surgical
mask and sterilized gloves,
Kenny squeezes a chunk of
John's back and propels a
long piercing needle in and
then back out.
Fondue chocolate is con-
gealing in the corner now. A
metal album called Wiscon-
sin Death Trip screams over
the PA.
By the wall, John Camp-
bell sits backwards on a
chair covered with a white
surgical tablecloth. A single
line of blood flows down
his bare back. His nipples
are pierced, "it doesn't hurt
nearly as much as you would
think," and he also has two
small silver metal tunnels
in his lobes. Marlee is snap-
ping smartphone close-ups of
the two hooks hanging from
four fresh holes in John's
back. The hooks are engraved
in swirly script with his and
Marlee's names, wedding
date, and the words "one year
anniversary" - a surprise
gift from Kenny.
It still smells like the bun-
dle of sage Kenny burned.
Behind him, on two disin-
fected tables covered with
white surgical table clothes,
is his makeshift piercing sta-
tion: boxes of rubber gloves,
sterilized rubber gloves,
lubricant, saline and alcohol
solutions, dental bibs, blue
dye, gauze in rows of "pre-
" and "post-packs," various
types of hooks Autoclaved
and hermetically sealed, plus
some sutures - just in case.
John eats his third pack of
M&Ms. We're talking about
needles, and Marlee says
she's terrified of hypodermic
needles, which surprises me
because she's a phlebotomist;
also because what's a hypo-
dermic needle to hanging
upside-down from your knees
(Marlee's doing that next.)
"I'm just scared of tak-
ings fluids in and out of my
skin," she said. But you're not
scared of suspending?
I tell her how I like shots.
She calls me weird.
John looks nervously at the
rigging in the center of the
room. From a metal roof sup-
port 20 feet up, a thick rope
hangs between two metal
pulleys. A carabiner connects
the lower pulley to a small
flat metal bar with lots of
holes. A thinner rope weaves
through the holes leaving two
long loops.
We gather around the rope
and Kenny attaches the hooks
in John's back to the rigging.
Last year, John only got off
the ground for a few seconds
before feeling a panic attack
coming on (he suffers from
them regularly). He wants
to improve on that record.
Kenny starts pulling the rope
slowly, and the slack taut-
ens. The hooks pull the skin
on John's back until it turns
white. Kenny increases the
pressure slowly. Skin stretch-
es. It looks like bat wings have
been growing, about to burst

from his back. I can't take my
eyes away.
A part of me weirdly wants
to know what that feels like.
Suspending from your back.
Floating like that. Another
part of me wants to run away
before its Marlee's turn.

Five books for the

"I'm going to read more!"
"I'm going to do my homework
a week in advance!" "I'm not
going to wait until the last min-
ute to write my Michigan Daily
article!"
We've all lied to ourselves
before.
We've all tricked our overly-
ambitious 20-something minds
into believing our fall semester
was going to be productive, not
like those "other" semesters.
But it didn't happen. It didn't
happen partially because of
classes and clubs and work,
and partially because you're
not Malala Yousafzai. "Who's
that?" you ask. At 17, she's the
youngest Nobel Peace Prize
Winner ever. Read the news.
Who has time to read
though? Between classes, daily
calls home to your parents,
running for CSG President and
playing quarterback for the
football team, who can spare
even an hour to read?
Reading doesn't have to be
a chore though. It can be fun,
like jet-skiing with Hillary
Clinton or bungee-jumping
from the St. Louis Arch. Or
sleeping. Maybe avoid "Infi-
nite Jest," "Atlas Shrugged,"
or "The Dictionary of Modern
English Usage" (all books in my
room). Just fly through quick,
sharp novels.
Here are a few that you
might not know about:

Satirist and humorist
George Saunders is widely
regarded as one of contempo-
rary literature's most-impor-
tant and most original voices.
His bizarre and off-beat sto-
ries shed light on what's been
in front of our faces the whole
time, often much to our cha-
grin. He's been compared to
Raymond Chandler, Kurt Von-
negut, even Mark Twain. He's
just that good.
Published in 1997, "Civil-
WarLand in Bad Decline"
is Saunders's first book. Six
short stories and a novella.
That's it. In just 192 pages, he
picks apart a dystopian Ameri-
ca with precision and simplic-
ity, deconstructing everything
from race to class to sex. It'll
take about a day and'a half to
finish (breaks included) and
will look great next to a cof-
fee mug on your Instagram or
slipped into the front pocket
of your messenger bag.

TRAILER REVIEW

Pharrell Williams's "ItGirl" is
byfar the mostvisuallyinterest-
ing music video I have seen in
a long time.
The produc-
tion combines
anime-like It Girl
scenes, Pharrell
old-school-
video-game Columbia
graphics and
even some bizarre, neon-inverse
coloring of a dancing Pharrell.
The music video opens up on
a sandy cartoon beach. As Phar-
rell begins the first verse, mus-
ing"my compass spinning baby,"
a compass in the sand is shown
spinning on the beach. Such
continuity between the lyrics
and visuals occurs sporadically
throughout.
The nextscene is a grooving
Pharrell, with his entire body
flashing and filled in by bright,
neon colors. The background
is plastered with hundreds of
floating little characters and
symbols. The stimulus overload
from this scene makes it abso-
lutely off-the-wall and unique.
A videogame that looks alot
like Maplestory then pops up
on the screen with Pharrell as

the skateboarding protagonist,
but then quickly changes into an
anime beach scene of sorts.
I could definitely see "It
Girl"getting some heat for this
video here, as there are plenty
of young looking girls in bathing
suits who certainly have clearly
defined, um, proportions.While
this may be typical of anime/
manga style art, Pharrell lurking
in the background with apair of
binoculars inspectingthe girls
definitely sets a creepy vibe for
the moment.
The music video proceeds to
alternate between its computer-
generated trippiness, cutesy-
video-game sets and anime
scenes until finally rolling out

the credits in a similar fashionto
Pokemon games on Game Boy.
Personally, my favorite part of
"It Girl" comes alittle after the
halfway mark, when cheesy-vid-
eo-game Pharrell buys a dolphin
spaceship, goes to outerspace,
shoots some bad guys and visits
Galactic Mount Rushmore with
Pharrell's face (and hat) chis-
eled in.
Even from the start of the
music video, it's clear that the
computer-generated animations
and effects of "It Girl" allow for
fantastical outside of the box
thinking that makes this pro-
duction well worth five minutes
of your time.

Internationally
known' event
draws Goth-
Industrial crowd
By ADAM DEPOLLO
Online Arts Editor
The streets were quiet when
I drove with a friend to Necto
on a Monday night two weeks
ago. It was about midnight; we
found a parking spot in front of
the State Theatre, walked across
empty intersections toward the
club's unassuming facade and,
finding no line, made our way
inside.
I really wasn't sure what I
would be seeing behind those
doors. I knew that Necto's
Factory Monday must attract
a healthy crowd - it has been
a tradition since 2004 and,
according to the club's website,
is "internationally known" - but
I honestly had no idea what to
expect from the night's Goth-
Industrial crowd. What exactly
do several hundred morose,
leather- and guyliner-clad
twenty-somethings do when
they together in a room?
After climbing the stairs
leading to Necto's main dance
floor, it became immediately
clear that I had been asking the
wrong question.
I was there during Halfway
to Halloween, one of Factory
Monday's monthly theme
parties, and the club was filled
with around 600 costumed
patrons sporting a roughly
equal mix of goth-inspired
garb and bright, colorful outfits
taken from video games and TV
shows. The mood was festive -
everyone was waiting for the
night's culminating costume
contest - and as my friend and
I went around the club talking
to some of the guests, the warm,
welcoming feeling pervading the
room was inescapable.
I asked the patrons I spoke
with how often they came
to Factory Monday and was

surprised to find that almost
everyone in the room was a
regular. Sal Giorzano, a tall
guy dressed as the villain from
"Repo Man," explained that he
had been coming to the night
since it began in 2004.
"Shit, I've been here probably
two years' worth of Mondays,"
he said. "I've been coming here
for twelve years, since they
started Mondays here."
And it became increasingly
clear that the welcoming
atmosphere I noticed when I
walked into the room is exactly
what attracts people to Factory
Mondays. Samantha Littleton
and Nicole Walker were relative
newcomers to the night -
Walker had only been there a
handful of times and this was
Littleton's first visit to the club
- but they were willing to drive
more than four hours from their
home in Michigan's thumb to
enjoy the comfortable vibe at
Necto.
"I feel comfortable here,"
Walker said. "People normally
look at me weird for wearing
leather, but I like to come
here because I always get
compliments on it. So it's the
atmosphere, everyone's so nice."
"I actually only came here
because of (Walker)," Littleton
added. "I'm not really into the
whole goth thing. But I like it so
far. Like she said, everybody's so
nice here."
Necto Manager Bryan Kostoff
and DJ Jinx, the two directors
of Factory Monday, explained
that that friendly, welcoming
atmosphere is what allows the
night to be successful, even on
an off-day like Monday.
"The community is very
inclusive and very vibrant,"
DJ Jinx said. "You'll walk in
and you'll meet one person,
then you'll meet thirty more
before you leave for the night.
It's actually one of the things
that makes a night on a Monday
thrive instead of a traditional
weekend. Everybody seems to
want to talk to everybody else, it
makes it a better place."
The welcoming vibe at

Factory Monday differs starkly
from other Industrial nights
around the country, which, as
Kostoff explained, can often be
somewhat exclusionary.
"Other places that typically
have industrial music or that
kind of scene, it's a kind of a
hard crowd," he said. "They only
play rather aggressive industrial
music, it's not a very welcoming
environment. It's a little elitist."
And Necto's more eclectic
atmosphere can turn off more
devoted members of the goth
scene like Giorzano.
"Let's put it this way," he said.
"This is the second time I've
been here in a year. I've stopped
coming. If they have big events,
I'll come out for the big events.
The crowds have changed a lot.
The new generation sucks, but it
is what it is."
But as DJ Jinx and Kostoff
explained, Factory Monday
isn't really about catering to any
particular crowd.
"For us, we try to have a
much more open vibe to what
we do," Kostoff said. "We're not
a straight up Industrial night -
we try to embrace nerd culture
because that's who we are."
"We're a potpourri night, in
a lot of ways," DJ Jinx added.
"We welcome everybody, you
know, the strange from any
community."
It's about building and
supporting an eclectic
community of people, a circle
of friends who, though drawn
from different backgrounds,
are simply there to have a good
time and enjoy each other's
company.
"If I wanted to cater only to
the 'I'm gother than thou, oh
woe is me' crowd, we'd be doing
fifty or sixty people a night and
I'd be bored and depressed out
of my mind every week," DJ
Jinx said. "But with this, I've
got people who I genuinely
want to see and look forward to
hugging and seeing next week.
Every Monday is like a family
reunion, and every week my
family gets a little bit bigger
and more unique."

When Brendan McCall was
a student at the University in
the late '90s, he thought about
becoming a lawyer, or maybe
an architect. He still could pass
for one - medium height, slim,
with a trimmed beard and thick
glasses. But one look at his arms,
and his profession becomes quite
clear.
"There's two ways to tell if
someone's actually a cook. One,
your arms are burned," he says,
jerking up his sleeve to reveal a
series of thin red lines running
elbow to wrist. "If you're a chef
and your arms aren't burned,
you don't work in the kitchen any
more."
"And then this," he says,
pointing to the bottlecap-sized
callous between his index finger
and palm, the result of years of
gripping a knife.
McCall has certainly earned
his scars. He's now the executive
chef at both Mani Osteria and
Isalita, two wildly popular
restaurants on East Liberty that
are favorites of both reviewers
and students alike. But McCall's
journey started as akid, when his
hands were still soft buta love of
food was already seared into his
conscience.
Born in Somerville,
Massachusetts, McCall moved
around a lot, but was anchored
by his large, extended family -
many of whom originated from
Sicily.
"It's cliched at this point, but
cooking is part of your lifestyle,"
he says of his Italian-American
heritage.
"You don't have to rediscover
food as a daily part of your life,
which is what's happened to a lot
of Americans," he adds.
Growing up in a family where
grandparents might have three
separate kitchens in one house,
and children were enlisted to
peel potatoes and pick herbs at
every gathering, it would be hard
not to become a food lover. But
when McCall came to Ann Arbor
for college, he soon learned that
he wouldn't always have thirty
food-crazed paesanos with him

at every meal.
"I took it for granted, because
that's how I grew up," he says.
"But then you come to college
and you suddenly have to create
and maintain that culture for
yourself."
As a student, he majored
in history and anthropology
and nurtured his ever-present
interest in cooking by hosting
dinner parties for friends. But
after graduating, and realizing
that he had no interest in law, he
decided to turn his hobby into a
living, at least until he figured
things out
"While I'm decidingthis, I still
have to pay my bills to U of M, so
I thought 'Why don't I get in a
kitchen?"' he says.
McCallgotafootinthe kitchen
door by starting at the lowest-
ranking positions, dishwashing
and prepping, at Diamond Jim
Brady's Bistro in Novi. He waited
patiently for a chance - really a
temporary promotion.
"There'll be an instance where
some guy calls off, he has too
much to drink the night before,
he doesn't show up for his shift,
you've been paying attention, and
then suddenly you're workingthe
lunch shift," he says.
McCall kept paying attention
and was soon working different
stations in the kitchen and
making friends and connections
in the industry. These early
days were a slog, no doubt, but
necessary to learn the basics. He
then moved on to kitchen jobs
in Metro Detroit, and stints in
Portland and Charleston, before
finally returning to Ann Arbor,
for what he dubs a "followed-a-
girl-here kind of thing."
Now back in his college town,
McCall became a sous-chef at
Eve, a once-lauded Kerrytown
establishment that unfortunately
closed in 2011. He even worked
at Zingerman's, or "anywhere I
could get knowledge," as he puts
it.
His big break came, however,
when he became the executive
chef at Everyday Cook, a unique
new eatery and store in the
Kerrytown Market. It was a
highly creative, experimental
environment, where lunch every
day was determined by the
bounty of the farmers market,
and private dinner parties could
feature cuisines, and proportions,
not typically seen in these parts.
"We'd do something like
15 course tasting menus from
southern Spain for eleven
people," McCall says with a
laugh.
After a short stint in catering,
McCall wanted to open his own
place. When I ask whether,
because of his background,
he immediately wanted to do
Italian, he explains that the
restaurant business is rarely that
accommodating.
"If you've been in the business
long enough with friends, you've
had a lot of ideas for things you'd
want to do, but you can't find the
space, can't find the backing,
can't find the team," he says. "
You need someone who's going
to take that chance on you, so
I was really just waiting for a
chance, rather than a specific
cuisine to do."

With his business partner
Adam Baru, he opened Mani in
May 2011. McCall knew that for
the restaurant to be successful,
and satisfying, it had to have
the correct proportions of

authenticity and comfort, which
are always a concern when
serving "real" Italian food.
"You want it to work, right?
There's really no point in doing
it if people aren't going to enjoy
it. We're trying to make them
happy, we're trying to feed
them. If they're happy, we have
a healthy business," he says
"If I try to do something
that's only for me, only what I
love, but no one else likes it; and
I keep pushing it, then that's
just ego, and it's not going to
work in the long run anyways,"
he adds.
Mani's menu reflects this
philosophy. There is a simple
Margherita pizza, but there's
also one with pistachios and
red onions. Brunch features
an egg dish, but this egg is
all'amatriciana, an adaptation of
the classic Roman pasta sauce
of tomato, Pecorino cheese and
cured pork cheek, or guanciale.
"What we try to do is make
it approachable, oftentimes
recognizable, but with lots of
surprises, with an element of
discovery," he says.
And as Mani gets more and
more popular, McCall's dishes
can get more and more creative
and surprising
"When we opened, people
just wanted the salads and the
pizza," he says. "It took several
months for them to say 'Lets try
the octopus,' or 'Let's have more
of that pork belly.' They start to
trust you a little more. Now that
we have their trust, I think we
can do more."
But Mani wasn't enough.
Baru's wife is Mexican, and he
and McCall had always wanted
to open a Mexican eatery in
Ann Arbor that went beyond
burritos and nachos. This idea
became Isalita, opened two
years after Mani, but separated
by just a wall. One wouldn't
have thought it would be
hard to serve Mexican food in
Ann Arbor, but McCall says
otherwise.
"If you want to talk about
having a difficult time with
people's understanding of the
cuisine, Mexican is a much more
difficult sell than Italian," he
says. "Italian has a much longer
history of being related to fine
dining, of people thinking that
they'll go out for a full dinner,
while people think of Mexican
as knocked-down, inexpensive,
lots of beans and rice, lots of
cheese."
Isalita's menu isn't any of
those things -think watermelon
gazpacho and braised lamb
tacos. And though it is a separate
restaurant from Mani, ideas and
people flow between them.
"The staff is excited by both
sides. You'll see a lot of the staff
at Mani dining at Isalita, and
vice versa. Both sides are very
proud of both restaurants," he
says.
McCall is himself proud of
having fathered this multi-
cultural restaurant family. But
his success doesn't mean that
he can sit back and watch the
kids peel the potatoes and pick
the herbs. When he shows the
photographer and me Mani's
wood oven, we ask if he'd

mind standing in front of it
for a photo, or if the heat, now
shimmeringoffthe bricks, is too
uncomfortable.
He laughs. "This is where I
stand every night."
