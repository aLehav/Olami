A 
diverse 
crowd 
of 

about 
100 
people 
filled 

the Michigan Union Rogel 
Ballroom Wednesday night 
to listen as male and female 
survivors of sexual assault 
shared their stories at the 
Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center’s 30th 
annual Speak Out event.

The event was organized 

by 
SAPAC’s 
Networking, 

Publicity 
and 
Activism 

Volunteer Program, led by 
LSA senior Alyssa Dunbeck 
and 
LSA 
junior 
Srinidhi 

Subramanian. 
SAPAC, 
a 

University 
entity, 
trains 

students to act as a peer 
network 
for 
survivors 
of 

sexual 
assault 
and 
aims 

to 
advocates 
for 
social 

change through professional 
services, such as counseling 
and crisis hotlines, for the 
campus community.

Dunbeck and Subramanian 

opened 
the 
program 
by 

noting the survivors’ stories 

were confidential, and the 
speak out aims to provide 
a safe place to empower 
survivors to share on their 
own terms. They asked that 
only 
survivors 
of 
sexual 

assault talk in front of the 
audience, and defined sexual 
assault as an umbrella term 
that includes rape, stalking, 
sexual 
harassment 
and 

intimate partner violence. 

The

Daily 
was 

asked to not quote directly 
from any survivor’s story.

For many incoming freshmen, 

leaving home for the first time is 
a source of excitement and fear, 
regardless of how far they’re 
going.

But for international students, 

like Music, Theatre & Dance 
junior Jessica Gomes-Ng, living 
thousands of miles from home 
for years at a time is adds new 
elements to that experience.

Gomes-Ng said studying in 

the United States was an easy 
transition because of her previous 
education 
at 
international 

primary and secondary schools 
in 
New 
Zealand, 
Vietnam, 

Belgium and Singapore.

Nearly 
a 
thousand 
people 

gathered on the Diag and marched 
through University of Michigan 
buildings for a student walk-out 
protest against racism on campus 
following President-elect Donald 
Trump’s upset win Wednesday 

afternoon.

The 
walkout, 
which 
was 

organized 
by 
the 
student 

organization Students4Justice, was 
also attended by civil rights activist 
Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Prior 
to 
the 
event, 
the 

Students4Justice released a list of 
demands that they hoped to achieve 
from the protest.

The 
list 
included 
demands 

for University action to protect 

underrepresented 
minority 

students 
by 
re-channeling 

resources, as well as a call for the 
University to be an immigrant 
sanctuary 
site, 
to 
double 
its 

commitment to rejecting racial 
harassment, to divest from unethical 
corporations and to remove all 
symbols and fliers associated with 
the alt-right movement and those 
encouraging white supremacy.

LSA junior Lakyrra Magee, one 

of the event organizers, highlighted 
the call to make the University a 
sanctuary campus — a designation 
that would empower Universities 
to limit institutional cooperation 
with federal immigration officers 
seeking 
out 
undocumented 

students— as among the most 
significant demands.

“Our main message was this: 

Because President Schlissel came

In a Wednesday press release, 

the University of Michigan stressed 
that the 2017 commencement 
ceremony 
— 
the 
bicentennial 

ceremony — will include multiple 
in-person speakers.

The release came after a petition 

circulated among seniors this week 
alleging that there were tentative 
plans to ompile a video of past 
speakers instead of one or both of 
the traditional speakers — typically 
a student and a keynote speaker.

Engineering

President-elect Donald 

Trump has selected incoming 

University of Michigan Regent 

Ron Weiser as a finance vice-

chair for his inauguration this 

January, meaning Weiser will 

be serving in that capacity 

when he starts in his role as 

regent. 

Weiser, a University of 

Michigan alum and previous 

chairman of the Michigan 

Republican Party, was elected 

to the board along incumbent 

Regent Denise Illitch (D), 

edging out incumbent Regent 

Laurence Deitch (D) and 

moving the board to a 5-3 

Democratic majority instead of 

its current 6-2 balance. He ran 

on his promise to freeze tuition 

rates and balance the growing 

budget.

Protests and vigils over 

Trump’s election, as well as 

several hate crimes reported in 

the aftermath of his election, 

have been frequent on campus 

over the past few weeks, with 

many students expressing fear 

and concern about what impact 

the next president could have.

Prior to serving on the 

inauguration committee, 

Weiser was also part of a 

national fundraising effort for 

the Trump Victory Committee 

during the campaign season, 

which Deitch frequently noted 

in his campaign. In an event 

last week, Weiser said he 

agrees with Trump’s economic 

policies but does not agree 

with all of his rhetoric in 

response to questions about his 

support for Trump.

“We all make choices, and 

I’m an economic conservative 

and I think that some of 

the things that I believe 

in are fundamental, and I 

don’t believe that they’re 

being promoted in order 

to take advantage of the 

disadvantaged,” Weiser said. 

“I spent most of my life trying 

to help the disadvantaged, not 

take advantage of them.”

He could not be reached for 

comment Wednesday on the 

appointment.

in Belgium, so I was around that 
type of environment for a while,” 
she said. “I was a little homesick 
for a while, but I got used to it 
because I’m quite used to being 
independent.”

According to the University 

of Michigan admissions website, 
international students make up 
14.4 percent of the University 
undergraduate population and 
originate 
from 
118 
different 

countries. Despite obstacles such 
as securing jobs in the United 
States, this number continues to 
grow.

Across the nation, the number 

of international students studying 
in American universities is at 
an all-time high. According to 
the annual Open Doors report 
released Monday by the Institute 
of International Education, since 
2015 the number of international 
students in the United States has 
grown by 7.1 percent to reach 1 

million total.

Many students from global 

backgrounds, 
like 
Gomes-Ng, 

attended international schools 
either in the United States or 
elsewhere for their primary and 
secondary education. University 
alum Alice Song, who graduated 
in 2015, said her parents’ decision 
to send her to boarding schools 
in Thailand and Canada was 
influenced by their concerns with 
the Korean school system.

“It’s a lot of studying and 

conformity (in Korea),” Song 
said. “Everyone takes the same 
classes and there are not many 
extracurricular 
activities 
or 

resources available.”

Many international students 

said the highly rated programs 
offered by the University are also 
a strong draw for enrollment, 
particularly in specific fields of 
study like engineering or pre-
medicine. 
Engineering 
junior 

Tay Tantivirun said he also 
likes the emphasis that both his 
international schools and the 
University 
place 
on 
learning 

outside the classroom.

“The difference between my 

international school and public 
schools in Thailand is that they 
really emphasize sports and doing 
activities,” he said. “That’s what 
I like about coming to Michigan. 
You’re not just here to study.”

A shift in identity
For 
many 
students, 
their 

time studying in the U.S. is 
characterized by the personal 
as well, experiencing shifts and 
changes in their identities.

Song, 
who 
identifies 
as 

bisexual, 
said 
escaping 
the 

constraints of traditional Korean 
society and studying abroad has 
allowed her to explore who she is 
and become more open-minded.

“Here, there’s a lot more 

freedom as to what you can 
identify with or what is OK,” 
she said. “I feel like when I go 
to Korea it’s like I have to be in a 
certain way because that’s just 
how it is considered. People care 
a lot.”

She said she has not told her 

family 
about 
her 
orientation 

because she believes her mother’s 
conservative 
upbringing 
in 

Korea has contributed to a lack 
of understanding of the LGBTQ 
community.

“She’s trying really hard to 

understand,” she said. “It’s me 
that’s changing, not her. That’s 
why it’s so difficult to talk about 
certain 
things 
because 
it’s 

hard to understand from her 
perspective.”

Song said she felt a disconnect 

with 
her 
identity 
during 

sophomore 
year 
overall 
— 

living outside of Korea for so 
long made her lose connection 
to her ethnicity. She also said 
she 
was 
influenced 
by 
the 

fear of being associated with 
negative stereotypes reflecting 
international students.

“I didn’t very strongly identify 

as a Korean,” she said. “There was 
nothing good that could come out 
as identifying as Korean because 
there were a lot of stereotypes 
about 
Asians 
in 
general 
or 

studying abroad that I didn’t want 
to be associated with.”

Tantivirun 
echoed 
these 

sentiments, saying the prolonged 
time he has spent outside his 
home country has left him feeling 
alienated in both Thailand and 
the United States.

“I’m 
really 
different 
from 

people back home in Thailand 
because I’ve been abroad for so 
long,” he said. “Sometimes I feel 
like an outside when I’m home. 
And sometimes when I’m in the 
United States, I don’t feel exactly 
at home.”

Despite this, Tantivirun said 

he is glad to be attending school in 
the United States. He said leaving 
the country he has lived in for 
most of his life to learn in a new 
environment has allowed him to 
see opportunities that he did not 
have at home.

“You’re so used to the world 

that you live in,” he said. “But once 
you move out, you start realizing 
the flaws and what’s wrong with 
certain things.”

Life on campus
Coming from an international 

school, 
Tantivirun 
said 
he 

was prepared to handle the 
difference in the environment 
of American colleges. He credits 
this ease from culture shock to 
the 
extracurricular 
activities 

offered at the University, citing 
student organization BLUElab 
in particular as an outlet he 
could use to discover what 
he was passionate about. The 
organization, comprised of 12 
multidisciplinary project teams, 
promotes collaboration with local 
and international stakeholders on 
a variety of issues.

“It 
really 
changed 
my 

perspective,” Tantivirun said. “I 
really want to do engineering for 
humanitarian purposes. In the 
long run, I want to come back 
home and help out my country.”

For Song, her time in English-

speaking international schools 
in Thailand and Canada was also 
beneficial in transitioning into 
post-secondary education in the 
United States.

University of Michigan alum Bryon Maxey discusses his student activism during his time at the University at 
Rackham Ampitheater Wednesday. 

of the microphones stationed 
around the space. The audience 
was urged not to clap, but to sit 
in silence as a show of respect 
and to reflect on the survivors’ 
words. Because the content 
shared in the event could have 
been 
potentially 
triggering 

for other survivors, SAPAC 
advocates 
were 
stationed 

outside the doors to talk if 
anyone needed to exit the 
space and survivors could go 

to a “debrief” after the event.

After the event, Dunbeck 

said 
she 
thought 
it 
ran 

smoothly, noting that there 
was 
never 
a 
long 
pause 

between 
the 
survivors’ 

sharing of stories.

“I think it went really well,” 

Dunbeck said. “It’s a space 
for survivors to share their 
stories and we almost had no 
lulls in the conversation at all. 
Everyone went up right after 
another and got to tell their 
story.”

As 
the 
SAPAC 
Speak 

Out is an annual event, the 
co-coordinators 
said 
they 

drew on how the event has 
been run in the past to ensure 
the continuity of the message 
of the speak out.

“I think in general, from 

our 
notes 
from 
previous 

co-coordinators, I think it’s 
maintained 
the 
same 
idea 

throughout, the structure of 
the event is pretty much the 
same,” Subramanian said.

Dunbeck and Subramanian 

ended the event by inviting 
audience members to place a 
flower on a painting of a tree at 
the front of the room, to show 
their solidarity with survivors 
of sexual assault. They also 

encouraged members to write 
down their stories and place 
them in a designated box at 
the back of the room if they did 
not feel comfortable speaking 
in front of a large audience.

Dunbeck 
said 
she 
has 

volunteered 
with 
SAPAC 

for four semesters and was 
inspired by her mother, who 
works as a police officer 

dealing with sexual crimes. 
She 
said 
she 
wanted 
to 

make a positive impact like 
her mother, and to support 
survivors.

“We want all the survivors 

to know that we believe them, 
we support them and if they 
need any help to come and 
see SAPAC or to call our crisis 
line,” Dunbeck said.

LSA sophomore Nicholas 

Maternowski 
attended 
the 

event as a SAPAC volunteer. 
Volunteers wore “I Believe 
You” buttons and directed 
survivors to an advocate if one 
was needed. He said he was 
pleased with how the event 
went, especially in terms of 
how 
sensitive 
the 
subject 

matter was.

“I think it went really well,” 

Maternowski said. “I mean it’s 
obviously a difficult topic for 
people to talk about, so it’s just 
very powerful to see people 
talk about their experiences 
in such a open space. It’s very 
eye-opening.”

“It’s a space for 

survivors to share 
their stories and 
we almost had no 

lulls.”

“We want all the 
survivors to know 

that we believe 

them, we support 

them.”

out and said he cared about diversity 
and marginalized students, we 
are here to show so many students 
at the University, people who are 
living in Ann Arbor, support the 
University of Michigan becoming a 
sanctuary campus,” she said. “And 
if President Schlissel really cared 
about (protecting) marginalized 
students, this is one concrete way he 
can do it besides showing up.”

Protesters cited a number of 

concerns 
during 
the 
walkout, 

including the two hate crimes in 
downtown Ann Arbor that have 
been reported to police since 
Trump’s presidential win last week. 
On Friday, a woman was threatened 
and forced to remove her hijab. On 
Saturday, a woman was pushed 
down a hill and verbally harassed. 
Additionally, 
many 
speakers 

discussed anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ 
and anti-Muslim posters, many of 
them promoting themes of white 
supremacy, that have been found 

posted on campus several times in 
the past few months.

LSA junior Alyiah Al-Bonijim 

spoke to the crowd about her 
frustrations 
with 
Islamophobic 

comments triggered by her choice to 
wear a hijab.

“For what? Because you want 

to see my hair? Is that what is 
important to these fucking white 
people?” Al-Bonijim asked the 
cheering crowd, saying that forcing 
a woman to take off her clothing, 
including the hijab, was sexual 
assault.

Protesters 
also 
touched 
on 

the failure of a Central Student 
Government vote Tuesday night to 
divest from corporations that have 
allegedly committed human rights 
violations 
against 
Palestinians. 

Many in the crowd yelled negative 
chants about CSG during the 
walkout. 

Following the initial assembly on 

the Diag, the protesters marched 
throughout Central Campus, also 
entering buildings to continue their 
chants. 

As the march moved through 

campus, student organizers, as 

well as Jackson, led the crowd 
in a number of chants condemning 
racism, sexism, islamophobia and 
xenophobia.

Chants included slogans such as: 

“No justice, no peace,” “Hey Hey, Ho 
Ho, these racist folks have got to go,” 
“No Alt-Right, no KKK, no fascist 
USA” and “Black Lives Matter.”

“Thanks for stepping up and 

fighting back,” Jackson told the 

crowd. “Do not let any election 
oppress your dreams … Red, yellow, 
black and white, you are all precious 
in God’s sight. We must learn to 
live together. This land is a land of 
multiculturalism.”

Jackson led student chants, 

showing solidarity with those all 
of those who felt marginalized in 

the past months, including Black, 

Muslim and Mexican-American 
students.

“We are all sanctuary,” he said. 

“We love each other. We care for 
each other. You take one of us, you 
must take all of us. We are not going 
anywhere. This land is our land. 
We will outlast the meanness, we 
will outlast hate. We will outlast 
violence. Love will conquer hate.”

According to the event page on 

Facebook, the walkout was part of 
a national walkout movement at 
universities across the country.

“This walkout is a national 

movement that is happening in 
response to the election, as well 
as the increase in hate crimes and 
other forms of violence against 
marginalized (folks).” The event 
description says “We are doing 
this to hold President Schlissel 
and our Regents at the University 
of Michigan accountable for their 
claims of valuing diversity and 
student safety and well-being.”

There was a brief moment of 

silence at the Burton Memorial 
Tower, where students told stories 
of their own personal struggles.

At the end of the walkout, 

organizers 
asked 
for 
white 

supporters to block State Street so 
protesters could safely gather at 
Angell Hall for the speakout.

White students were asked by 

organizers to peacefully block the 
roads and talk to the police in order 
to protect the lives of brown and 
Black people, who were said to be 
targeted more at student gatherings. 
Rackham student Vikrant Garg, a 
walkout organizer, asked for a non-
violent protest and for all students 
involved to march peacefully.

“We see a lot of white folks 

here,” he said. “We need you on 
the sidelines to protect us … there 
are going to be parts where we 
shut down the street. We need you 
all to be there to protect us. This 
is nonviolence, we recognize that 
violent acts you may commit will, in 
the end, hurt us the most.”

The walkout is one of the largest 

events to take place after the 
election on campus. On election 
night, an impromptu vigil consisting 
of roughly 30 students coalesced 
on the Diag at about 3 a.m., an 
hour after Trump was declared 

victorious. The next night, a vigil 
attended by about 1,000 students 
took place, during which University 
President Mark Schlissel and CSG 
President David Schafer, an LSA 
senior, called for campus unity and 
inclusivity. Multiple protests against 
the president-elect and in reaction to 
the hate crimes has since occurred. 

At Wednesday’s walkout, LSA 

junior Victoria Johnson said she 
came to the event in hopes of 
reaching 
the 
administration’s 

attention regarding the problems 
facing minorities on campus.

“These problems have been 

boiling up for a long time — this isn’t 
anything new,” she said. “But I think 
the election, I think what happened, 
has been tipping the scale. Now 
these people who have always been 
against the rights for me and my 
rights and who I stand as a person, 
my identity. They feel empowered 
to speak out and act on these hateful 
feelings they have. And that’s why 
I am here, because my rights are at 
stake. And not just my rights, but my 
safety. And I feel like it’s important 
to make the University be held 
accountable for it all.”

WALKOUT
From Page 1A

about face taken by world around 
us. As events unfold rapidly, this 
world seems increasingly against 
us, our prosperity, our joy and 
our 
very 
existence. 
Tuesday 

morning, Michigan in Color was 
given the opportunity to reflect, 
to connect with the living and 
breathing history of civil rights 
activism in the United States by 
interviewing 
Reverend 
Jesse 

Jackson. MiC editors discussed in 
depth the impact of these recent 
elections with Reverend Jackson. 
We inquired about the future of 
this country, of activism and the 
continuing the fight to dismantle 
our interconnected oppression. We 
wanted to know what this moment 
meant to him in the context of a 
lifetime of activism. How had he 
been making sense of the larger 
sociopolitical implication of the 
recent election of Donald Trump? 
The 
conversation 
unfolded 

into a narrative of struggle, 
perseverance, and perspective. 
Although not religiously affiliated, 
all of the editors can attest to that 
fact that the experience was in 
fact spiritual. His words, etched in 
over half a century of experience, 
spoke to our past, present and 
future. A better future.

Four themes emerged from 

our 
discussion: 
accountability, 

responsibility, action and hope. No 
words could ever fully encapsulate 
the experience and we continue 
to process our conversation and 
its implication for our lives and 
the lives of those around us. 
However, the senior MiC editors 
present you with short reflections, 
intentionally weaving in the words 
of Reverend Jackson and the 
experiences of our campus climate 
and world. These messages we 
share with you all.

RESPONSIBILITY

“They were hoping students would 

be indifferent by telling them ‘you’re 
our future’. You are not our future. 
You are right now. What you do or 
going to do matters right now.”

Reverend Jesse Jackson guided us 

through the tumultuous journey of 
social and political change in a time 
where today’s climate is extremely 
hostile 
towards 
marginalized 

communities. He instilled a great 
sense of urgency upon us. In a time 
of violent oppression, it is no longer 
an issue of building the future, 
because the future is now. 

“What you do or don’t do matters 

right now. Whether you finish school 
or not matters right now. If you’re 
developing skills or not developing 
skills it matters right now. If you vote 
or you don’t vote, it matters right now. 
So you put political options on hold. 
No.”

Apathy has no place in the now. 

Making the passive decision to 
be silent is the active decision to 
accept oppression in the case that 
the tools are available for us to 
create change as individuals at the 
university. Yes, there is a struggle 
to build and protect resources, but 
simply witnessing it is definitely not 
enough. As individuals, we cannot 
let our grief, our anger, discourage 
us. It must liberate us to learn, 
develop and take political action.

In light of the presidential 

election, Reverend Jackson told us, 
in response to Colin Kaepernick’s 
decision to not vote, that the most 
important weapon combating the 
enemies of systemic oppression, 
prejudice and discrimination is 
voting.

“One weapon is marching feet. 

One weapon is voting. One weapon is 
boycotts. One weapon is intellectual 
strengths. One weapon is mass 
organization. The strongest of these 
weapons is voting, because it sets 
laws.”

We have the tools to us as 

communities to initialize change, 

but we cannot forget our civil duty 
to let our voice be heard through 
our vote — a right we have been 
afforded through the struggle of 
great visionaries.

“We marched too long and bled 

too much for the right to vote to walk 
away from it as if it does not matter.”

It is our responsibility to learn 

from those have paved the way for us 
to continue their cause. They have lit 
the torch to illuminate the darkness 
and they have passed it onto each 
and every one of us to get us out of it. 
We have a duty to make a change. It 
starts with ourselves. It starts with 
you, and it’s happening. Right now.

ACCOUNTABILITY

“If (a woman’s) hijab is snatched 

off, it’s like someone else is putting 
Blackface on. We should all be 
offended by each other’s burden. We 
should share the burden. The more 
you share, the easier it is to bear.”

As a nation we have to hold one 

another accountable for the America 
we want to be and for the values we 
have espoused. In his final months 
in office, President Obama urged the 
American people to hold their next 
president accountable, to make them 
better like we did for him. This is 
true now more than ever.

More than ever, we need to be 

engaging with our elected officials 
— and not just about the issues that 
affect us personally. We should all 
be disgusted by the hate crimes 
happening in our country. We 
should all be appalled by the idea 
of legislation that would militarize 
police, register Muslims, threaten 
women’s 
autonomy 
and 
strip 

LGBTQ rights. We have to organize 
and demand that our elected officials 
do not turn the clock on progress, no 
matter their political affiliation. As 
Reverend Jackson said, “we’ve got to 
protect the gains we’ve made.”

To the Republicans and Trump 

supporters who are quick to say 
they aren’t racists, misogynists 

or xenophobes, prove to us by 
your actions that you are not. As 
your candidate takes office, the 
onus is on you to make clear that 
you will not stand for the violent 
dismantling of minority rights. 
As Reverend Jackson poignantly 
stated, “to vote for Trump you’ve 
got to excuse an awful lot of mean 
things. You’ve got to excuse attacks 
on Muslim immigrants, excuse 
attacks on Black people. You’ve got 
to excuse misogyny… and so, when 
people make their choices there’s 
consequences for their choices.”

If you don’t stand for racism, 

misogyny and xenophobia, stand 
up for the rights of your fellow 
Americans.

For those of us most negatively 

impacted 
by 
the 
upcoming 

presidency, it is often difficult to 
engage with the other side. It should 
not always be on us to advocate 
for our lives and our rights to exist 
peacefully in this country. But that 
doesn’t mean we can disengage from 
the collective history our struggle 
for civil rights in this country. 
We cannot altogether disregard a 
political system, that without our 
protest, will continue to perpetuate 
our oppression. In this democracy, 
a system where the loudest voice 
rules, we cannot be silent.

 — Sabrina Bilimoria, Michigan in 

Color Senior Editor

ACTION

“As long as there’s massive 

direct action that’s nonviolent and 
disciplined with a point, you can be 
heard.”

The fight for civil rights is not 

over. The Voting Rights Act may 
have passed in 1965, but the 2016 
election was marred by the success 
of laws aimed to suppress Black 
and other marginalized voters. In 
addition to still fighting for the right 
to vote, xenophobia, racism and 
sexism are now being turned into 
policy. People question our Muslim 
friends’ loyalties and the Latinx 
community’s right to be here. The 

fight for civil rights is not over. 

We face social, political and 

economic concerns, but if we do 
not mobilize we will not be heard. 
Reverend Jackson said, “If they 
attempt to undermine protections 
to the right to vote, that’s cause 
for direct action. If they threaten 
Roe vs. Wade and women’s rights 
of self-determination, that’s cause 
for action. If there’s thoughts for 
increasing student loan debt, that’s 
cause for action.” If we stay silent, 
our hopes and dreams for a more 
equal America can not, and will not, 
be realized. We have two options, 
our vote and our voice. With our 
vote, we choose those who represent 
us. With our voice, through direct 
action, we represent ourselves and 
the causes we want righted. We 
must act to protect the gains we have 
made and to fight those who wish to 
take them away. However, the call 
to action is not a call to violence. 
Reverend Jackson said, “We need 
constant disciplined direct action, 
nonviolent because when action 
becomes violent, violence becomes 
the subject line instead of the subject 
itself.” Through peaceful protest we 
begin to raise awareness, through 
violence we create reason to disavow 
our actions. The stakes are too 
high to permit others to hijack our 
message. 

Fifty-one years ago, Reverend 

Jackson, Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., and other members of the Civil 
Rights Movement marched to end 
Jim Crow laws and create a better 
America. Today, we are privileged 
to follow in their tradition of using 
nonviolent direct action to fight for 
our cause.

— Ashley Tjhung, Michigan in 

Color Senior Editor

HOPE

“At the end of the day, we must go 

forward with hope and not backward 
by fear and division.There’s a tug of 
war for the soul of America. We’ve 
survived apart, but living together, 
that’s the great American challenge.”

Reverend Jackson has seen it 

all. He has labored in the trenches 
for decades and endured a lifetime 
of systemic oppression, prejudice 
and discrimination. He’s witnessed 
first hand some of our greatest 
historical victories as people of color, 
but he’s bore first hand some of the 
consequences of our failures. Yet, 
despite every obstacle, every failure, 
every challenge, he has remained 
steadfast in his fight for civil rights 
and social justice.

His life and experiences are are 

a testament that today, we must 
not lose hope. Just as he and the 
activists who have come before us 
were longsuffering in their struggle 
for justice and equality, we too must 
continue our struggle to be seen, 
heard and understood. What our 
society faces now is yet another 
changing tide in America’s racial 
and political climate that we must 
overcome. As Martin Luther King Jr. 
said, “The arc of the moral universe 
is long, but it bends towards justice.”

Reverend Jackson tells us we 

must acknowledge the challenges 
that face us and work together to 
address them. We must learn to 
share the burdens of marginalized 
communities. We must recognize 
the selling of fear and false hope by 
those in power and work to find our 
own genuine hope.

The heart and soul of America is 

at stake, and the greatest challenge 
ahead of us lies in our ability to unify 
to fight this good fight for justice. 
Will we continue to be divided or 
are will we learn to work and live 
together?

“You must position yourself with 

your moral weaponry. We intend not 
to marginalize apartheid, we intend 
to eliminate it. We don’t attempt 
to marginalize those opposed to a 
woman’s right to self-determination, 
we intend to fight for the women’s 
right to self-determination. The lines 
are drawn clearly.” — Reverend Jesse 
Jackson.

student advisers to the committee.

Hyde received 1,152 responses 

from seniors by midnight Monday, 
of which 97 percent expressed a 
negative opinion about replacing 
speakers with videos.

She 
said 
she 
decided 
to 

circulate 
the 
survey 
as 
part 

of a larger complaint to the 
bicentennial 
committee 
and 

the subcommittee dedicated to 
planning 
the 
commencement 

ceremonies because she anticipated 
a more traditional celebration to 
commemorate graduation from the 
University.

“You could do it in addition, but 

it shouldn’t change the program 
because people have been looking 
forward to potentially being a 
student 
speaker,” 
Hyde 
said. 

“They’ve been coming with all 
these different ideas to talk about 
and be inspiring to their fellow 
classmates and future colleagues. 
And they want to have some big-
name, inspiring person coming 
and talking with them to inspire 
them for their future as well. This 
is supposed to be a celebration and 
you’re supposed to be excited about 
it, but I feel like a video doesn’t do 
that justice.”

The press release, University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald said 
the aim of the University is to make 

the event memorable for attendees.

“One voice is not enough 

to fully celebrate this historic 
commencement,”he said. “We want 
to make this a truly memorable 
experience for the students of 
our bicentennial class and their 
families.”

According to the release, the 

ceremony will include a music 
performance 
by 
a 
nationally 

recognized individual or group, 
as well as speeches from and 
recognition of alumni and a video 
created 
by 
current 
students. 

Graduating students will also sit on 
the field for the event, a break from 
tradition.

Details of the ceremony are 

slated to be announced in early 
2017.

LSA senior Francesca Sands 

who was sent the survey this 
week, said in an interview before 
the University release she was 
surprised and angry at the thought 
of replacing either speaker with a 
video.

Sands 
said 
she 
anticipated 

commencement 
speakers 
who 

would address current events, 
especially in light of the recent win 
of President-elect Donald Trump. 
She said she felt a video could not 
sufficiently address the particular 
salient issues facing soon-to-be 
graduates currently on campus.

“Especially with the climate 

after the election, with everything 
socially and politically, we’re going 
to be graduating terrified, pretty 

much, and I think that needs to be 
addressed,” she said. “I feel like a 
video highlighting parts of other 
speeches from past years isn’t 
addressed to us or the time we’re 
going to be entering the world in. I 
was disappointed.”

She also voiced her concern over 

the perceived lack of transparency 
and student input in the planning 
process.

“I’m worried that people will be 

caught off guard by this decision in 
March, whenever they’re supposed 
to release the speaker,” Sands said. 
“And then there’s nothing they can 
do about it.”

Hyde closed the survey Monday 

night after receiving additional 
information from the Bicentennial 
Advisory Committee that it would 
not entirely replace both speakers 
with videos. However, she said the 
committee had not communicated 
this to the student advisers she 
knew on the committee at the time 
she released the survey.

She 
said, 
in 
general, 
she 

felt the committee could have 
communicated more with students 
from the start to confirm this 
was an acceptable change to the 
traditions of the ceremony.

“Even if they were planning on 

changing it, the students should 
have been consulted,” Hyde said.

Action against DAPL needed

NOOR AHMAD AND ZACH KOLODZIEJ | OP-ED

N

ow 
that 
Donald 

Trump 
has 
been 

elected, 
it 
is 
time 

to face the truth about the 
outcome of the Dakota Access 
Pipeline. North Dakota is the 
second-largest 
domestic 
oil 

producer in the United States. 
Trump 
backs 
measures 
to 

upgrade United States oil and 
gas infrastructure and won the 
state of North Dakota by a wide 
margin.

Currently, 
85 
percent 
of 

the DAPL has been built. The 
only part that remains is the 
section planned to be built 
under the Missouri River. This 
past 
Friday, 
Kelcy 
Warren, 

the CEO of Energy Transfers 
Partners, 
the 
Dallas-based 

construction company in charge 
of building the DAPL, stated 
that 
the 
incoming 
Donald 

Trump administration is “100 
percent sure” the pipeline will 
be approved. This year, Warren 
donated $103,000 to the Trump 
campaign.

Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R 
-

–N.D.) is a proponent of the 
pipeline and serves as one of 
Trump’s agricultural advisers. 
He activated the North Dakota 
National Guard to deal with 
the protests, which currently 
has a traffic checkpoint a 
few miles south of the main 
protest encampment. Though 
the president-elect has yet to 
comment on the pipeline, his 
campaign financial disclosure 
forms 
reveal 
that 
he 
has 

a financial interest 
in its 

completion. He has reportedly 
invested 
between 
$500,000 

and $1 million in Energy 
Transfer Partners.

The 
#NODAPL 
movement 

in Standing Rock, N.D., is a 
place that has stood in direct 
opposition 
to 
environmental 

devastation, as well as spiritual 
and cultural genocide. The $3.7 
billion Dakota Access Pipeline, 
a black snake of fracked Bakken 
crude oil, is planned to travel 
under the Missouri River and rip 
through the sacred land of the 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. It 
is not a question of if, but when, 
it will burst, destroying one of 
the world’s largest sources of 

freshwater and spilling 500,000 
gallons of toxic sludge into what 
is currently drinking water for 
people of the Standing Rock 
tribe and communities in South 
Dakota.

Enbridge Energy Company, 

which 
has 
the 
largest 

ownership stake in the Bakken 
Pipeline — which includes the 
DAPL — at nearly 30 percent, 
is responsible for many U.S. 
pipelines, including Michigan’s 
own aging and crumbling Line 
5 that transports tar sands 
crude oil under the Straits of 
Mackinac. We cannot forget 
Enbridge’s 
Line 
6B 
that 

burst and contaminated the 
Kalamazoo River in July 2010, 
one of the severest and costliest 
oil spills in U.S. history.

The 
construction 
and 

inevitable spills of pipelines 
in recent years have not only 
wreaked 
environmental 

havoc, but continue the 500-
year genocide that threatens 
to extinguish the natural way 
of life that indigenous people 
know to be a familial and 
inseparable connection with 
all of Earth.

From the occupation of a 

prayer camp called the Sacred 
Stone Camp — a paryer camp 
established in April of 2016 
by LaDonna Bravebull Allard 
of the Standing Rock tribe — 
the #NODAPL movement has 
tremendously 
expanded 
to 

become many camps. The camps 
continue to grow daily — as a 
gathering of water protectors 
from hundreds of tribal nations 
and 
countries 
standing 
in 

solidarity against the pipeline.

The message that has drawn 

people to come together in 
resistance and communal prayer 
is the knowledge that water 
is life. And it is the inarguable 
attack upon life that has caused 
the water protectors to react in 
nonviolent direct action against 
Dakota Access.

Water protectors literally 

stand and live in the path set 
for the Dakota Access Pipeline, 
blocking 
construction 
with 

their bodies. Law enforcement 
departments from five states 
and the National Guard have 

been called in to intimidate, 
attack, 
arrest 
and 
forcibly 

remove protectors with riot 
gear 
and 
military 
tanks. 

County, 
state 
and 
federal 

government 
officials 
have 

failed to condemn these acts 
of excessive force, choosing 
instead to side with corporate 
interests.

On 
our 
campus, 
an 

interdisciplinary 
group 
of 

students 
has 
come 
together 

to spread awareness at the 
University of Michigan about 
the DAPL. We have written a 
comprehensive and educational 
zine to explain the background 
and timeline of the Standing Rock 
Sioux, the cultural significance of 
the water, the legal challenges at 
play and the importance of the 
current resistance. We hope this 
publication serves to provide 
critical information about the 
resistance at Standing Rock so 
you can best be of service and 
navigate your role as an ally to 
the indigenous people on the 
frontlines.

The 
#NODAPL 
movement 

of Standing Rock continues to 
stay strong in the face of these 
injustices through prayer that 
roots protectors in love and 
healing. As the inauguration 
approaches, Dakota Access will 
push harder to put the pipeline 
through at all costs. Now more 
than ever we need a strong 
coalition of water protectors, 
allies working in solidarity and 
decisive action from the Obama 
administration to reroute the 
Dakota 
Access 
Pipeline 
and 

defend indigenous rights.

This Friday, Nov. 18, there will 

be a zine-release fundraising 
event for Standing Rock in 
North Quadrangle Space 2435 
from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. There 
will be free food, zines, audio 
interviews 
and 
information 

about the moon dance ceremony, 
as well as a visual gallery of the 
occupation in Standing Rock, 
N.D., and a drum circle. Contact 
us at michsolidaritynodapl@
umich.edu.

Address the reasons divestment keeps failing

ARI ALLYN-FUEUR | OP-ED

T

uesday 
night’s 

debate and vote on a 
Boycott, 
Divestment 

and 
Sanctions 
divestment 

resolution 
against 
Israel 

would be exciting — if it 
weren’t so repetitive. This is 
the 10th time this spectacle 
has taken place, and every 
time, with a lot of acrimony, 
the resolution is voted down 
— and largely for the same 
reasons. I support Palestinian 
rights and statehood. I oppose 
the construction of Israeli 
settlements in the West Bank. 
But I opposed this resolution. 
And now, I’d like to send a 
clear message to divestment 
supporters, 
identifying 
the 

things they can do to strengthen 
the next divestment campaign 
and enable a resolution to pass.

First, don’t make it a BDS 

resolution. The BDS movement 
is toxic because of both its 
means and its ends. The BDS 
platform is that Israel, and only 
Israel, should be subjected to 
total political, economic and 
cultural boycott: Everything 
Israeli should be totally off- 
limits. And the BDS platform’s 
express purpose, per its own 
central committee members, 
is to destroy Israel. This time, 
divestment campaigners tried 
to insist that their resolution 
didn’t support these means or 
ends, even as the text of the 
resolution and the campaign 
around it were all about BDS. 
Next time, really and sincerely 
cut yourself off from BDS. 
Denounce it in the text.

Second, legislate a process, 

not an outcome. This resolution 
was directed solely against 
Israel without any effort at 
neutrality or consistency and 
identified specific companies 
to 
target. 
Pro-resolution 

speakers 
insisted 
that 
the 

resolution was the beginning 
of a conversation, but the 
outcome was baked in. Next 
time, 
write 
the 
resolution 

properly. Identify an objective 
and neutral set of criteria for 
divestment on human rights 

grounds and empower a body 
to apply them consistently to 
every country and company the 
University of Michigan invests 
in. Or, better yet, empower 
a body to take broad input 
from students and professors 
across the University to create 
divestment criteria. And if 
occupation 
is 
a 
consistent 

criterion for divestment, be 
prepared to divest from Turkey, 
China, India, Russia, Israel, 
Morocco, Ethiopia, etc., for 
their respective occupations. 

Third, 
be 
extremely 

scrupulous 
about 
avoiding 

anti-Semitism. A lot of council 
members voted no because they 
were worried, reasonably, about 
intercommunal stress. These 
divestment campaigns are run 
in such a manner that they 
can reasonably be interpreted 
as 
attacks 
against 
Jewish 

students. 
The 
Palestinian 

campus group Students Allied 
for 
Freedom 
and 
Equality 

began its divestment campaign 
this 
time 
with 
incendiary 

public demonstrations against 
Israel only, timed specifically 
to take place during two major 
Jewish holidays. Then, last 
night, its speakers disparaged 
anti-resolution 
speakers 
for 

“hanging out at Hillel” and 
“going on birthright.”

Last 
year 
when 
this 

resolution was up, it was 
even worse. Jewish council 
members were doxxed and 
received death threats. SAFE 
activists shouted ethnic slurs 
on the Diag and posted online 
under 
their 
own 
names. 

SAFE, 
in 
its 
institutional 

capacity, 
protested 
Central 

Student Government inviting 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 

professor to speak on the 
history of the region on account 
of his Jewish ethnicity. Next 
time, divestment supporters 
should be extremely careful not 
to do any of these things. They 
should run their campaign in 
a scrupulously non-prejudiced 
manner, and act immediately 
to condemn and correct any 

prejudice instances that do 
occur. That would do a lot to 
reassure people.

Fourth, be open about the 

process. This resolution was 
launched as a sneak attack. 
The vote was only announced 
two days beforehand. Space 
in the hall was limited with a 
ticket process. The text of the 
resolution wasn’t announced 
until the day of the vote, and 
even then, only by request. The 
authorship of the resolution 
was kept secret until halfway 
through the council session, 
and then disclosed only after 
several points of order. Pro-
divestment council members 
tried to insist that the council 
vote secretly; they wanted 
to enable people to pass the 
resolution without owning up 
to their support for it. These are 
all red flags. Next time, write a 
resolution you can proudly vote 
on in public, and put the text 
out with authorship well before 
it’s introduced. Engage people 
to figure out how to improve it 
and address concerns.

With 
these 
measures, 
a 

divestment 
resolution, 
not 

against 
Israel, 
but 
against 

human rights abusers defined 
by 
reference 
to 
objective 

criteria, would enjoy a much 
higher chance of passing. After 
10 attempts, I think divestment 
advocates owe it to themselves 
more than anyone to take 
their movement seriously and 
address the mistakes of the 
previous campaigns so they 
can pass something productive.

And if they don’t? If the 11th 

and 12th and 13th campaigns 
look just like this one, with 
a 
BDS 
resolution 
against 

Israel alone rushed through 
with 
the 
greatest 
possible 

surreptitiousness amid a flurry 
of anti-Semitism? That would 
be a clear signal to the rest of 
us about what the purpose of 
these campaigns really is.

It’s #notmycampus — it’s ours

MICHAEL SUGERMAN | COLUMN

T

here have been many 
“not mys” this week. 
“Not 
my 
campus.” 

“Not my president.” “Not my 
country.” You’re all right — 
these things are not yours. 
They are ours. We should 
be 
concerned 
by 

how 
polarized 

things 
seem, 
and 

perhaps by how we 
may 
be 
complicit 

in 
amplifying 

that 
polarization. 

What 
we 
share 

and how we share 
it 
is 
increasingly 

contentious. 
This 

election 
and 
its 

aftermath illustrate 
as much.

This isn’t a call for unity. 

Unity is overrated. We won’t 
always agree on matters of 
politics. In fact, it’s important 
not to, because more often than 
not, what makes a policy “good” 
falls to normative judgment. 
Sharing and debating a wide 
swath of opinions is invaluable; 
such discourse broadens our 
collective 
worldview 
and 

creates 
the 
framework 
for 

compromise.

Now more than ever we need 

to (re)learn how to coexist, 
and 
to 
approach 
conflict 

with civility and respect, not 
judgment and violence. That 
much is true regardless of the 
candidate for whom you voted. 
We are all human beings with 
basic shared desires — these 
include security and wellbeing, 
with applications from physical 
to financial to psychological. 
Our individual pursuit of what 
we need varies infinitely, but 
at its core we can find common 
ground.

If 
you 
didn’t 
vote 
for 

Trump, consider why such 
a vast portion of the United 
States did. Know that their 
frustration and anger might 
have paralleled what you feel 
now if Trump had lost. Many 
Trump voters feel they are 
being 
mischaracterized 
as 

racist, bigoted xenophobes — 
and yes, clearly, some of them 
are this way — but why might 
scores of people have voted for 
him in spite of concerns about 
his language?

Because they supported his 

economic 
policies? 
Because 

border definition and national 
security 
are 
reasonable 

concepts? 
Because 
Clinton 

epitomized dynastic politics 
and had so much baggage that 
she didn’t seem worth it? The 
list goes on. Trump’s following 
should not be ignored, and 
perhaps members of it have 
been, in one way or another, for 
quite some time.

If you did vote for Trump, 

consider why such a vast 
portion 
of 
the 
country 

didn’t. 
Understand 
why, 

overwhelmingly, 
people 

of 
color, 
Latinx, 
Muslims, 

coalitions of women, those 
who identify as LGBTQ+ and 

more are so upset. 
Understand 
why 

they feel unsafe.

Trump’s diction 

throughout 
his 
campaign, 

intentionally 
or 

not, has seemingly 
made 
these 

contingencies even 
more 
subject 
to 

discrimination, 
hate and violence 

than they were before. We’ve 
seen it in our Ann Arbor 
bubble, and the reality is, many 
who have been and are being 
marginalized feel that having 
voted for our president-elect 
constitutes tacit approval of 
these consequences.

Ultimately, 
then, 
now 

is not the time for either 
disillusionment or reticence. 
These will exacerbate political 
stratification and othering — 
which we cannot afford.

If 
you 
signed 
the 

“#notmycampus” 
petition, 

I 
think 
you’re 
misguided. 

You 
don’t 
get 
to 
call 

“microagression” when it suits 
your agenda, but decry an 
overly sensitive, “politically 
correct” America when your 
status quo is challenged.

If you’re so upset by the 

election’s outcome that you 
declare Trump is “not my 
president” and the U.S. is “not 
my country,” I think you may 
be misguided, too. People of all 
backgrounds talk about being 
disenfranchised by the system 
in one way or another, and the 
reality is that in democracy, 
we are all part of the system 
in some capacity, even when 
we feel outcast. Accepting this 
isn’t 
easy, 
especially 
when 

the 
institutional 
odds 
are 

historically stacked against you.

Instead of retreating to 

our corners, let’s talk to each 
other. It’ll be hard. Emotional. 
At 
times, 
triggering. 
But 

it will be necessary if we 
have 
any 
hope 
for some 

semblance of reconciliation. 
I think it’s going to require 
adopting certain practices that 
common opponents of “political 
correctness” 
hate: 
creating 

safe spaces, dispersing trigger 
warnings and acknowledging 
microaggressions 
when 

applicable.

Before 
you 
write 
these 

concepts off, consider that 
labels tend to be more divisive 
than the concepts they define. 
Some say trigger warnings and 

safe spaces are soft excuses 
for 
avoiding 
conflict. 
But, 

if I suggested that we warn 
students before a screening of 
“A Clockwork Orange” (which 
contains graphic rape scenes) 
that its content could prove 
traumatic for victims of sexual 
assault, I doubt I’d be rebuked. 
If I suggested implementing a 
judgment-free zone for people 
to ask difficult questions about 
race for which they may feel 
apprehensive, ignorant or just 
plain stupid, my conjecture is 
that few would object.

Don’t recuse yourself from 

dialogue 
that 
makes 
you 

uncomfortable. Be open to ideas 
you may disagree with, or even 
those which may offend you, so 
that we may find the common 
ground underlying opposing 
positions. On matters of policy, 
know that it’s OK if we don’t 
resolve our differences, but on 
matters of humanity, know that 
doing so is imperative.

We should all be outraged 

by the crime alerts of the last 
few days. So, regardless of your 
political affiliation, be an ally 
to the marginalized. This is a 
term with which I wasn’t all 
that familiar until recently, 
and I turned to my Facebook 
friends to help me define it. 
They said “allying oneself” 
to the marginalized entails 
listening to them; protesting 
alongside them even when our 
experiences are not shared; 
advocating fairness, equality 
and equity; intervening when 
we come into contact with 
family, friends, acquaintances 
and strangers alike who push 
unjust rhetoric or ideology at 
the expense of others.

It’s about asking people how 

you can be helpful, even if you 
don’t relate to what they’re 
going through. Really, being 
an “ally” is just having basic 
human decency. We are all 
capable of that.

The result of this election 

is set in stone, and we need 
to work together to move 
forward from here. Facebook 
posts 
and 
catchy 
Twitter 

hashtags 
aren’t 
enough. 

Subversions of our democratic 
systems, like petitioning the 
Electoral College to change 
the outcome, aren’t the answer 
either. 
Conversations 
with 

homogenous groups who share 
our opinions will only further 
divide us.

Do you want change? Let’s 

be good to each other, even 
when we disagree. Let’s do our 
homework. Read newspapers, 
get civically involved, vote and 
start listening. We can do this.

Michigan signs pair 
of top-level recruits

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team came into the 
2016-17 season expecting big 
things from freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, who scored 
72 points in a playoff game for 
Benton Harbor High School and 
was named Miss Basketball in the 
State of Michigan.

While the Wolverines have 

played just two games so far, 
Gondrezick 
has 
showcased 

her basketball prowess in both 
contests. In Michigan’s victories 
over Oakland and Niagara, she 
scored a total of 31 points, totaling 
nine assists and three steals in a 
combined 35 minutes of play.

Gondrezick’s 
performances 

were enough to win her the honor 
of Big Ten Freshman of the Week, 
an award now-sophomore center 
Hallie Thome won last year.

“(Gondrezick) does have the 

chance to be a really special 
player,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “She comes 
from two parents who played 
basketball at the highest level. She 
has grown up in the gym. She has 
a great feel for the game.”

This week, the Wolverines 

signed two new recruits that 
will likely have similarly lofty 
expectations next season.

One of them is guard Deja 

Church of Southfield, Mich. She is 
the No. 67 prospect in the nation 
according to Prospects Nation 
and was named Michigan Class 
A Player of the Year in 2015-16 
while leading Southfield Lathrup 
to a 21-5 season. Like Gondrezick 
last year, Church is a candidate 
for Miss Basketball this year.

Church’s 
transition 
to 

Michigan next season will be 
easier than it is for most, as she 

played AAU Basketball with 
Gondrezick 
and 
freshman 

forward KeAsja Peace on the 
Michigan Crossover.

“(Church) is a tough-nosed 

guard,” Barnes Arico said. “An 
important thing for us, really 
what we’ve tried to do the last 
few years is to try to get the best 
player in the state to stay at home. 
She had initially decided to go 
elsewhere and before signing day, 
she changed her mind and said, ‘I 
can’t let this opportunity at the 
University of Michigan pass me 
by.’ ”

Barnes Arico traveled a little 

further to find her other big-name 
recruit.

Forward Hailey Brown, the 

No. 38 prospect according to 
HoopGurlz, 
will 
move 
from 

Hamilton, Ontario, to play for the 
Wolverines. Brown has played 
for the Canadian National Team 
since 2013 and averaged 10.0 
points and 8.8 rebounds in five 
games at the 2016 U18 FIBA 
Americas competition.

“Brown is an outstanding ‘4’ 

player,” Barnes Arico said. “With 
Jillian Dunston being a senior 
next year, that’s an area where we 
wanted to add a player for sure. 
She is a 6-foot-2 kid who can play 
with her back to the basket. She 
has international experience and 
has traveled the world playing 
basketball since the age of 14.”

Church and Brown will be 

essential additions to Michigan 
in 2017-18, as the Wolverines 
will lose senior guards Siera 
Thompson and Danielle Williams 
to graduation after this year.

While next season is still a long 

way away, Church and Brown 
should give Michigan two new 
faces to get excited about, just like 
Gondrezick and Thome did the 
last two years.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

The Michigan men’s basketball team will face its first true test of the season Thursday when it takes on Marquette.

‘M’ to open 2K Classic with Marquette

Once again, the Big Apple 

is beckoning for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

Last season, the Wolverines 

traveled 
to 
Madison 
Square 

Garden to take part in the 
Big 
Ten’s 
inaugural 
“Super 

Saturday” event on Jan. 30, 
which featured a basketball and 
hockey 
doubleheader 
against 

Penn State. Michigan won that 
contest, 79-72, and now, it is 
returning to The World’s Most 
Famous Arena on Thursday to tip 
off against Marquette in the 2K 
Classic Championship Round.

“I can’t wait,” said senior 

guard Zak Irvin. “(We are) 1-0 
since I’ve been in the Garden. (It 
was) nice to play there last year 
against Penn State. It’s always 
nice going to New York because 
it feels like a home game, just 
from the alums and fans we have 
across the country.”

The 
Wolverines 
notched 

two wins against Howard and 
IUPUI in the tournament’s 
Ann Arbor regional, but those 
programs are a far cry from the 
competition they will be facing 
as the season rolls onward.

The matchup with the Golden 

Eagles, on the other hand, could 
provide the first true barometer 
of where Michigan stands.

Outside 
of 
losing 
Henry 

Ellenson, who led the team in 
both points and rebounds per 
game his freshman year before 
being drafted 18th overall by 
the Detroit Pistons, the Golden 
Eagles are returning most of 
their major contributors.

Center Luke Fischer and 

guards Haanif Cheanham and 
Traci Carter figure to be the 
most notable of that mix.

Fischer 
and 
Cheanham 

finished 
second 
and 
third, 

respectively, behind Ellenson 
in both scoring and rebounding 
last 
year, 
while 
Carter 
is 

entering his second year as 
Marquette’s point guard after 
averaging 4.6 assists through 
33 games during his freshman 
campaign.

Though it’s a limited sample 

size, the Golden Eagles have 
elected to start four guards 
alongside Fischer through the 

first two games this season.

With ample scorers on the 

perimeter, Marquette is poised 
to be Michigan’s first real 
opportunity to see how far 
it has come defensively after 
hiring assistant coach Billy 
Donlon. It’s not often that the 
Wolverines are the bigger team 
on the floor, but the Golden 
Eagles’ personnel could prove 
beneficial for Michigan.

“I think all of our guys have 

done a great job just holding 
each other accountable and just 
knowing that defense does win 
championships,” 
Irvin 
said. 

“That’s one of the huge things 
that we want to have a point of 
emphasis on this year, is be able 
to defend people, and I think 
this is going to be a good test 
for us, going against Marquette 
tomorrow.”

Added Michigan coach John 

Beilein: “They’ve only got the 
two big guys that are playing, 
Fischer and Heldt — he’s 6-foot-

10. We’ve got five of those guys 
on our roster. They’ve really got 
more depth on the perimeter. 
Hopefully, our size at some of 
those positions may affect some 
things, especially DJ (Wilson) 
and 
Duncan 
(Robinson) 
at 

6-foot-8, 6-foot-10.”

While 
it 
may 
have 
an 

advantage 
on 
the 
boards, 

especially 
with 
Wilson 

averaging 11 rebounds per game, 
there are still some aspects that 
could spell doom for Michigan.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

been plagued by slow starts 
so far this season. Against 
Howard, 
Michigan 
couldn’t 

get on the board until junior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman sank a 3-pointer over 
five minutes into the first half. 
In their matchup with IUPUI, 
it was more of the same, as the 
Wolverines traded baskets with 
the Jaguars until shots started 
to fall in the final four minutes.

That 
issue 
could 
be 

compounded by Marquette’s 
aggressive defense, which is 
tied for 23rd nationally with 
10.5 steals per game.

“For some reason, we’ve come 

out and haven’t got off to a type 
of start we want to get to, but we 
can have those good runs at the 
end of the half,” Beilein said. “I 
know Marquette, their steals 
are really high. They’re going 
to come out and try to impose 
their will. If we do not take care 
of the ball and make the shots 
we’ll get behind early. We’ve 
got to really take care of the ball 
from the very beginning.”

If the Wolverines come out 

sleepwalking Thursday, they 
could be staring at their first 
loss of the season.

***

Depending on its outcome 

against Marquette, Michigan will 
face either Southern Methodist 
or Pittsburgh on Friday.
Big Ten roundup

Just two weeks remain before 

the No. 16 Michigan hockey team 
kicks off Big Ten conference play 
in December against Penn State. 
At this point in the season, each 
of the teams in the conference 
have had a chance to establish 
a résumé. Here, we break down 
their 
preseason 
results 
in 

preparation for the upcoming 
Big Ten season.

No. 7 Minnesota

The Golden Gophers have 

played just eight games so far 
this season and have skated to 
a 4-2-2 record, with both losses 
at the hands of No. 12 St. Cloud 
State.

However, one of Minnesota’s 

most redeeming qualities that 
has been evident so far this year 
is the depth on its roster. Four 
different players have scored 
four goals each over the course 
of eight games, with 13 of the 21 
players on the roster recording 
at least one goal.

No. 10 Penn State

Not only have the Nittany 

Lions made program history 
with their highest-ever ranking 
in the USCHO poll this week, but 
senior captain David Goodwin 
also became the first Penn State 
player to reach 100 career goals. 
The Nittany Lions are currently 
holding on to a seven-game 
win streak and have an overall 
record of 9-1-1.

Penn State boasts an .864 win 

percentage for the season, the 
best in the Big Ten. The Nittany 
Lions will host Michigan in the 
teams’ first pair of conference 
games in two weeks.

No. 14 Ohio State

Like Penn State, Ohio State 

has only recorded one loss this 
season, a 6-2 game agaist Robert 
Morris. Also like Penn State, the 
Buckeyes have played 11 games 
so far, racking up a 6-1-4 record. 

Their penchant for ties isn’t 
exactly helping them move up in 
the polls, but it hasn’t hurt them 
either. They were ranked at the 
same spot last week.

The Buckeyes have plenty 

of seniority on their team, 
and they recently had two 
senior 
forwards 
receive 

weekly honors stemming from 
their 
performances 
against 

Connecticut last week. Nick 
Schilkey is currently tied for 
second in the NCAA in goals and 
recently tallied the 100th of his 
career, while David Gust scored 
four goals in a single game. Their 
contributions have helped Ohio 
State’s offense establish itself as 
one of the best in the country. 

Wisconsin

The Badgers have only played 

eight games so far this season, 
like Minnesota, but they’ve 
tacked on an additional win and 
loss for a mark of 5-3-0. 

Despite the fact that the 

Gophers 
are 
tied 
for 
10th 

nationally 
in 
offense, 
their 

struggling defense — which 
is ranked 48th and let up a 
combined eight goals in two 
losses to Northern Michigan — 
has held them back.

Michigan State

Michigan State rounds out 

the bottom of the Big Ten, with 
twice as many losses as wins 
(3-6-0). It suffered a pair of one-
sided losses (6-1 and 7-3) against 
Lake Superior State, whom the 
Wolverines will face after their 
next exhibition against the U.S. 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program. The Spartans have 
also lost two games to No. 1 
Denver and one game each to 
Michigan Tech and Ferris State.

However, both of Michigan 

State’s losses to Denver (7-2-1) 
were particularly low-scoring. 
The first game ended with the 
then-No. 6 Pioneers scraping 
out a 2-1 victory, where all three 
goals were scored in the third 
period. The second game settled 
at 3-1.

O’Korn has teammates’ confidence

In all likelihood, John O’Korn 

is now the starting quarterback 
of the Michigan football team.

That was a sentence a lot of 

fans expected to read before 
the first game of the season, 
before the emergence of redshirt 
sophomore 
Wilton 
Speight 

ultimately relegated O’Korn to a 
backup role.

But 
now, 
with 
Speight 

sustaining 
an 
unspecified 

shoulder injury in a loss to 
Iowa last week, the starting job 
appears to finally be in O’Korn’s 
hands.

For a team with College 

Football Playoff hopes — the 
third-ranked 
Wolverines 
(6-1 

Big Ten, 9-1 overall) still control 
their own destiny despite the loss 
— losing a starting quarterback 
with just two regular-season 
games 
remaining 
might 
be 

a cause for panic. O’Korn’s 
teammates, though, don’t seem 
to have that mindset.

“We’re gonna be running 

the same exact plays,” said 
senior tight end Jake Butt. 
“John’s been doing a great job 
understanding his role, and he’s 
been ready every single week 
and preparing every single week 
as if he were the starter. If his 
number is called, I’m confident — 
everyone’s confident — that John 
will be able to get this job done 
for us.”

It doesn’t seem to be blind 

confidence, either. Several of 
O’Korn’s teammates pointed to 
his methods of preparation and 
said they’re not expecting much 
of a drop-off.

That preparation started last 

season, when O’Korn had to 
sit out a year after transferring 
from 
Houston. 
He 
couldn’t 

play in games, but he was the 
quarterback of the scout team 
and earned scout player of the 
week honors several times.

Even after losing the job this 

year, O’Korn didn’t scale his 
preparation back. According to 
Butt, O’Korn likes to sit in the 
front row at meetings, is one of 
the first players to watch film and 
is one of the best note-takers on 
the team.

Though 
he 

hasn’t 
been 

calling 
the 

shots 
on 
the 

field, 
O’Korn 

has earned the 
respect 
of 
his 

teammates 
— 

including 
fifth-

year 
senior 

defensive 
lineman 
Chris 

Wormley, who said he wishes he 
spent as much time preparing as 
O’Korn did.

“John’s done a great job all 

year of being a leader, whether 
(he’s) playing or not,” Wormley 
said. “He’s still a leader in my 
eyes, at least. He watches film 
after practice probably more 

than 
anybody 

I’ve ever seen at 
the college level, 
which is weird 
for 
somebody 

that isn’t asked 
to play as much 
as he does. ... 
But 
with 
him 

doing that for 
the 
last 
two, 

three 
months, 

it’s gonna help 

him out big time if he’s starting 
on Saturday.”

O’Korn won’t have Speight’s 

10 games of preparation under 
his belt, but he does have one 
extra tool to help him out: his 
feet.

Standing two inches shorter 

and 30 pounds lighter than 
Speight, O’Korn has a proven 
ability 
to 
move 
around 
in 

the pocket and even pull off 
designed runs — as evidenced 
by his performance in this year’s 
Spring Game, where he tallied 28 
rushing yards and a touchdown.

“You see Wilton try and 

scramble and it looks like it 
hurts,” Wormley said. “But for 
O’Korn, he’s a little shiftier, a 
little faster and more athletic. 
He’s got a great arm, so I’m 
excited to see what he can do 
too.”

The rest of the team seems 

quietly confident, as well — 
according to running backs coach 
Tyrone Wheatley, it’s “plug and 
play.” Wheatley confessed that in 
practice, he’s usually zoned in on 
his own position group, but he’s 
noticed no peripheral difference 
under center.

For Michigan to accomplish 

its lofty goals — starting with 
beating Indiana on Saturday 
and winning a possible playoff-
deciding matchup at No. 2 Ohio 
State after that — it will need 
those differences to be as muted 
as O’Korn’s teammates expect 
them to be.

“O’Korn is gonna do well — 

you don’t look at it as a drop-off, 
you don’t look at it as anything 
different,” Wheatley said. “It’s 
the next guy in. Game normal.”

Redshirt junior quarterback John O’Korn may be thrust into action on Saturday if redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight is unable to play.

JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

“We’re gonna 

be running 
the same 

exact plays.”

Wolverines look back on chaotic finishes

Chris Wormley had been in the 

situation before. He looked, then 
took a deep breath. And then he 
had one thought: Get off the field.

Iowa’s Keith Duncan had just 

kicked a game-winning 33-yard 
field goal as time expired, and then 
came the Hawkeye fans streaming 
onto the field. Wormley knew he 
wouldn’t want to be caught up in 
that chaos.

And as he hurried off the field 

— his only prerogative to get to 
the locker room quickly — an Iowa 
fan accidentally collided with the 
6-foot-6, 
302-pound 
defensive 

lineman and flew backward to the 
turf.

“I was heading for the locker 

room after that loss, so I wasn’t 
thinking too much about who was 
in my way, who’s not in my way,” 
Wormley said Tuesday. “I hope 
he’s doing OK.”

It looked like a scary moment 

at first, but Wormley said he 
feels better about it now that he 
knows the fan is OK. The fifth-
year senior even joked that he’d be 
willing to be the “poster child” for 
a brochure at every game called 
“Field Storming 101” that taught 
fans how to avoid injury.

The fact is, Wormley has been 

through plenty of moments like 
Saturday’s, though that was the 
first iteration in the past two 
years that induced a rush of fans 
from the seats. In that span, the 
Wolverines have played in four 
games decided on the final play, 
winning two (at Minnesota last 
Oct. 31 and at Indiana last Nov. 14) 
and losing two (versus Michigan 
State last Oct. 17 and at Iowa on 
Saturday).

“It wasn’t the greatest feeling 

I’ve ever had, I would say that,” 
said redshirt sophomore tight 
end Ian Bunting about Saturday. 
“I kind of just walked off the field 

quickly to avoid as many people 
as I could. It was just … it sucks 
to lose. It’s never good to lose. 
Especially when you’ve won all 
your games this season other than 
that one.”

The 
most 
famous 
crucial 

play of the four, of course, was 
last year’s muffed punt snap 
against Michigan State, which 
the Spartans returned for a 
touchdown and a 27-23 victory. 
That time, a full crowd of 111,740 
watched in shock as the game 
changed and the visiting players 
piled on each other in the end 
zone with no time left.

Michigan followed that up with 

last-second escapes in two of the 
next three weeks. At Minnesota, 
the Wolverines trailed for most of 

the second half and lost starting 
quarterback Jake Rudock to an 
injury. But then-backup Wilton 
Speight stepped in and threw 
a go-ahead touchdown to Jehu 
Chesson with 4:57 left and added 
a two-point conversion that put 
his team up by three.

The Golden Gophers marched 

down the field on a 13-play, 
74-yard drive and landed inside 
the 1-yard line. There, Michigan’s 
defense stuffed a quarterback 
sneak as time expired, a play that 
— like the others — many watched 
with bated breath.

“I guess just everything’s out 

of your control at that point,” 
said redshirt junior defensive 
tackle Maurice Hurst. “… There’s 
nothing you can really do. You 

really (don’t) want to just have to 
have that feeling that you wish 
you could have done more. … 
That’d be terrible if you felt like 
you could have done a little bit 
more to change the outcome of 
the game.”

Yet 
the 
Wolverines 
found 

themselves in a similar position 
two weeks later at Indiana. 
Depleted on the defensive line 
and facing an up-tempo spread 
offense, they again trailed in the 
fourth quarter before forcing 
overtime on a touchdown pass 
from Rudock to Chesson with 
two seconds left. In the second 
overtime, safety Delano Hill 
broke up a fourth-down pass to 
preserve the victory and bring his 
teammates rushing onto the field 

to celebrate.

Michigan had coasted in seven 

of its first nine wins this year by 
at least 17 points, and Saturday 
was the latest drama it had faced 
in a game all season. This time, 
the Wolverines ended up on the 
wrong end of it. They have seen 
both sides enough to know that it 
makes for a nerve-racking finish 
in either case.

“It depends on what side you 

end up on,” Bunting said with a 
wry smile. “If you end up on the 
side that we were on last week, it’s 
disappointing and it’s frustrating. 
But that’s football, and it’s gonna 
happen. That’s what we sign up 
for. We sign up for, when we come 
to Michigan, to play in games like 
that and to win games like that.”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Fifth-year senior defensive end Chris Wormley has seen more than his fair share of last-second finishes in his career, including Saturday at Iowa.

ADVENTURES IN PIE-MAKING:

Cutting a slice of home in a post-election kitchen

By Madeline Gaudin, Daily Arts Writer

Design by Anne Lynch and Katie Beukema


2-BSide

2B — Thursday, November 17, 2016
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

My pie odyssey began last 

Wednesday at a pie dough class 
taught in the basement of the 
downtown branch of the Ann 
Arbor District Library. I had a hard 
time dragging my heavy heart the 
few blocks from my apartment — it 
was Nov. 9 after all.

I can’t bake. I can’t even cook. 

I really like microwaving frozen 
meatballs and eating cereal. I love 
takeout and those pink frosted 
cookies from Meijer. But a week ago 
I made an oath to a beautiful Senior 
Arts Editor that I would bake a pie 
for the B-side.

That’s how I found myself 

squishing a chunk of butter in my 
bare hands in the basement of the 
library on the worst day of the year. 
And I am so glad I did.

Before I dive into the details of 

flaky crust and cheesy pie toppings, 
I want to express my gratitude for 
the other people who attended 
the event with me. Nothing could 
have reaffirmed my beliefs about 
the innate goodness of people 
more than baking pie dough in a 
basement with 12 strangers — most 
of whom were women and not 
native English speakers.

The 
woman 
sitting 
across 

from me asked me what I do for 
Thanksgiving. She was new to the 
class, and she was trying to master 
an apple pie before the holiday. She 
scrolled through photos on her 
iPhone to show me pies — pies with 
sunken crusts, pies that were burnt 
and pies that looked beautiful but 
were (she assured me) not good at 
all. It felt good to know that in the 
midst of so much division, strangers 
still want to show you pictures of 
food on their phones. People still 
want to connect with each other.

“I started when I was about 

six at my grandma’s knee making 
chocolate 
chip 
cookies,” 
said 

Keegan Rodgers, head baker and 
bakery manager at the People’s 
Food Co-op, as well as the class’s 
teacher. “That started my love.”

Rodgers has been teaching 

baking classes through the co-op 
for five years. He began last 
week’s class by going over the 
dissimilarities between various 
types of dough.

“These are the greatest baking 

instruments you’ll ever need,” he 
said, lifting two butter-covered 
hands into the air.

We mushed the blocks of butter 

and began to mix them into the 
flour. Rodgers teaches a technique 
from this mixing called frisage.

“Fan money with your fingers,” 

he instructs us. The process 
involves coming up from under 
and pressing the butter through 
the flour and salt until the mixture 
is the consistency of cornmeal. 
The process of encapsulating 
the flour in the butter is what 
creates flakes. It’s also a reason 
to use additional flour sparingly 
when rolling out the crust. Flour 
that does not get encapsulated in 
butter is what makes the dough 
dry or hard.

The next step is to add the water. 

Rodgers suggests adding a tiny 
bit of vinegar to the water before 
adding the liquid to the dough, 
then just dumping it in. None of 
the sprinkle and mix method that 
many food writers promote.

And then you just mush around 

the dough, folding it in on itself 
over and over, until the dough 
no longer sticks to your fingers. 
That’s when you know it’s done — 
when your hands aren’t covered in 
dough any more.

And that’s it. The first half of my 

journey was complete without any 
injury or tragedy. Maybe baking 
pies can be easy — a sentiment 
Rodger agreed with. For students 
trying to bake in smaller kitchens, 
he recommends sticking with the 
Thanksgiving staple.

“Pies really are the way to go,” 

he said. “They’re so versatile.” 
His personal favorite is a lemon 
meringue, but more traditional 
fruit pies are often easier for 
amateur bakers (like myself).

Now I had the dough, but I 

didn’t know what to fill it with. So, 
I called the best chef I know — my 
dad. He passed on a recipe for an 
apple pie, an American classic.

I knew the recipe he sent would 

make a very good, very normal 
apple pie. But, I tried something 
a little different for my pie. The 
first adaption was pretty tame 
— my dad likes to use half apples 
and half pears when he is making 
his pies. The risk level for this 
culinary swap was low. Apples and 
pears are basically the same thing, 
right? 

The second change was a little 

more dramatic. My grandfather 
used to eat his apple pie with a 
big slice of cheddar cheese. When 
my dad passed that mental image 
down to me during our phone call, 
I was disgusted. Dairy in general 
is something I don’t like to think 
about too much — people who 
can drink plain milk are the worst 
kind of mythical creature. 
But I 

tried it. What is Thanksgiving all 
about if not familial oddities?

The recipe my dad passed 

along included instructions for 
making a cheese topping for the 
pie, so I decided to try that. I had 
to trek across town to get a cheese 
grater. I was originally going to 
use my pre-shredded Mexican-
blend cheese mix from Trader 
Joe’s, but a quick Google search 
told me that would be “completely 
gross.”

When I sat down to actually 

make the pie, I realized I didn’t 
have a pie tin. I almost had a pie 
tin, but I accidentally broke the 
ceramic one I was going to buy 
in the checkout line at Meijer and 
was too embarrassed to go back 
for another one. Alas, I went to 
CVS and found a cake pan that 
seemed sufficient.

Back home, I peeled and cut 

my apples and pears. I mixed 
my sugar and spices and coated 
the sliced fruit, but when I got 
out my dough I realized — yet 
again — how grossly unprepared 
I was for this adventure. I didn’t 
have a rolling pin. So I used a 
combination of a wooden spoon, 
a potato and my hands to roll/
smash the dough into sort of a 
circle.

Instead of covering my pie with 

a second crust, I baked it open 
like a tart (but, very different 
from a tart!) at 450 degrees 
Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. Then 
I grated my sharp cheddar over 
the top. The recipe told me then 
to put the pie in a broiler. “What 
is a broiler?” you might ask. I’m 
still not sure, but it sounds like a 
mixture of baker and boiler. My 
oven (miraculously) has a broil 
feature so I set out to use that. I left 

my cheese-coated pie in the oven 
on broil for about five minutes. 
When I took it out, it looked — and 
smelled — surprisingly delicious.

Then I went to cut myself a 

piece. I wanted so badly for my pie 
to be a success. It looked beautiful, 
and it smelled beautiful. I sunk 
the knife in expecting to hit the 
crisp lower crust but I got nothing. 
Nothing. The pie was liquid 
goo all the way through. I still 
dolloped a mound of apple/pear 
mush with cheese onto my plate. 
It was good, it was really good, but 
it wasn’t a pie. The dough on the 
bottom hadn’t hardened like I had 
expected it to; it had absorbed the 
moisture of the apples and pears 
and turned into mush.

I was so close. I had the perfect 

dough and a great recipe. I was 
going to make the kind of pie my 
dad would make, the kind of pie 
my grandfather would’ve eaten. 
But 
somewhere 
between 
my 

ancient oven, hand-rolled dough, 
cake pan and “broiled” cheese 
topper, 
something 
had 
gone 

horribly wrong.

Since eating the sad (but 

delicious) lumps of cheesy, sugary 
fruit with my roommate, I’ve 
called my dad. He assured me 
that anyone with a better kitchen 
and real baking tools could have 
tremendous success. So, never 
fear, reader! A cheese-covered pie 
and a slice of my weirdo family is 
within reach.

Recipe:
Crust:
· 5 cups all-purpose flour
· 1/2 tablespoon sea salt
· 1 pound unsalted butter, 

room temperature

· 1 cup cold water
· 1 tablespoon vinegar (mixed 

into water)

Combine flour and salt in a 

bowl. Work butter between hands 
until it is malleable but not melted. 
Mix the butter into the flour using 
the frisage technique mentioned 
earlier. Once the mix is the 
consistency of cornmeal, add the 
water and vinegar mixture. Knead 
dough until it no longer sticks to 
your hands or your work surface. 
Refrigerate for up to a week or 
freeze for as long as food products 
can usually be frozen — I do not 
know how long that is.

Filling:
· 5-6 cups apples, peeled, 

cored and cut very thin (I used 
half apples and half pears)

· 1/2 cup white or brown 

sugar (tart apples like Granny 
Smith might need 2/3 cup; I used 
Honeycrisps with 1/2 cup brown 
sugar)

· 1/8 teaspoon salt
· 1 tablespoon cornstarch
· 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
· 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
· 1 1/2 tablespoon butter
· 1 teaspoon vanilla
Combine sugar, salt, cornstarch, 

cinnamon and nutmeg. Sift over 
the apples and pears. Place them 
in layers in the crust. Dot with 
butter. Add vanilla on top.

For no cheese: Cover the pie 

with the second crust and prick 
the center. Bake for 10 minutes 
at 450 degrees. Reduce the heat 
to 350 degrees, bake for another 
45-60 minutes.

For cheese: Bake pie for 20 

minutes at 450 degrees without a 
top crust. Take pie out and grate 
cheese — sharp cheddar works 
well — over the top. Broil until 
cheese is melted. As the pie cools, 

FOOD COLUMN

T

his past weekend, my 
friends and I made 
the straining seven-

hour drive to Iowa and back 
for the football game only to 
return disappointed, heartbro-
ken and hungry.

As we desperately sped past 

The Largest Truck Stop in the 
World, the Mississippi River 
and the Indiana border, eager 
to return home to Ann Arbor, 
our conversation shifted to the 
dense smattering of billboards 
advertising fast food. Signs 
indicating exits to McDonald’s 
and Arby’s popped up over a 
dozen times, each time beck-
oning us to stray off our path 
and satisfy our hunger with 
greasy, salty food. Cracker 
Barrel called out to us with its 
“Country Fried Comfort.” It 
sounded better and better the 
more signs we passed.

I recall being pretty much 

infatuated with McDonald’s 
from an early age. I was always 
excited by the prospect of eat-
ing there, especially since it 
was a rare (once or twice a 
year) occurrence. The nov-
elty of eating at McDonald’s 
made it seem like a treat to be 
awaited, and any family mem-
ber or friend who took me there 
instantly won brownie points. 
The crispy fries and mystery 
toy prize triggered some part of 
my brain that made me yearn to 
go back again each time I went.

I couldn’t understand why 

my mom wouldn’t allow me 
my coveted Happy Meal more 
often. If it was so good, why did 
she act like it was something to 
be avoided or limited to infre-
quent indulgences?

This memory crossed my 

mind as my friend and I began 
discussing how totally and 
completely 
disgusting 
the 

poor excuse for real food the 
grease-soaked, 
sodium-laden 

combination of chemicals is 
that these establishments serve 
their customers. I mean, who 
do they think they’re fooling 
into thinking that it’s real food?

Six-year-old me, that’s who.
Though from an early age 

we’re told to eat our vegetables 
and restricted from choosing 
any of the highly appealing 
sugary items in the grocery 
store cereal aisle by our par-
ents, there’s a basic instinct 

we all share — the desire to eat 
what tastes good. That desire 
has been tapped into and com-
modified by the vast majority 
of the American food indus-
try and the corporations that 
oversee fast food chains like 
McDonald’s. 
Advertisements 

and packaging designed to 
appeal to our desires permeate 
the food landscape, infiltrating 
our homes and our newsfeeds 
and littering the margins of our 
highways.

These monstrous fast food 

chains 
market 
to 
increase 

consumption and reduce con-
sciousness. Their ultimate goal 
is to profit. And if people are 
willing to subsidize places like 
these in return for a cost-effec-
tive, gratifying meal, no matter 
the form in which it’s present-
ed to them, these companies 
don’t have much of an incen-
tive to do otherwise. They sure 
do know their audience. Can 
you think of anyone else who’s 
made the news recently that 
does as well? (Hint: the new 
president-elect of our country, 
Donald Trump).

While we scrutinized the 

phenomenon that is the fast 
food industry for several miles, 
it hit me — the political sphere 
has become a lot like consum-
erism, selling us platforms that 
we’re believed to want, not 
necessarily the less shiny, less 
enticing policies and candi-
dates we actually need.

In a sense, Trump’s cam-

paign platform offered up a 
heavy serving of political fast 
food — promising to boost the 
economy and reinforce nation-
al security. The simple tag line, 
“Make America Great Again,” 
repeated over and over again 
and stamped across bright red 
hats acted as a fast food mar-
keting slogan, extending the 
promise of comfort and sat-
isfaction through superficial 
means. 

I’m by no means a political 

expert and don’t claim to know 
the many reasons prompting 
individual voters to support 
Trump, but I can attempt to 
assess the mass appeal of the 
most prevalent ideas purport-
ed by him and his campaign. 
Within the framework of the 
fast food industry, Trump is 
a Big Mac. He appeals to hun-
gry voters (white middle-class 
individuals who feel disenfran-
chised and disillusioned with 
their system of government) 

with a simple, yet resounding 
promise of satisfying them. 
The frequency and repetition 
of his campaign slogan and 
auspicious rhetoric strategical-
ly made him appear favorable 
to an audience craving a seem-
ingly easy, quick fix (like a 
cheap, readily available meal).

Surely by now, everyone’s 

sick and tired of hearing about 
the election and about Trump 
(especially in the form of 
online rhetoric), but it’s diffi-
cult to push the events of the 
past two weeks out of my mind 
as I think about the role food 
plays in our society and every-
day lives, because the media 
and our political system inex-
tricably play a similar role.

In the past few years, the 

media 
(particularly 
social 

media) surrounding the elec-
tion has been inescapable, and 
its content has grown more 
sensationalized, more disrup-
tive and more nonsensical than 
has ever been before. Rather 
than working to the detriment 
of a candidate who utilized 
this absurdity to its extreme, it 
worked to his benefit. And that 
says more about what charac-
terizes our country culturally 
and socially than it does about 
the candidate himself.

It’s 
easy 
to 
disseminate 

information and ideas through 
simple means, just as it is to 
mass produce frozen burg-
ers and sell them to consum-
ers. Now that we’ve become 
consumers of mass media and 
social media, it’s more impor-
tant than ever to selectively 
choose what we consume and 
how we consume it — just as we 
do with food.

At the end of the day, people 

are being sold a facsimile of 
what they want — whether it’s 
a flashy new vision of America 
that may be unrealistic or det-
rimental to its people, or a bev-
erage containing enough sugar 
to knock out a small child for 
an hour — regardless of wheth-
er it’s really what they need.

So, to six-year-old me, the 

golden arches and red boxes 
promising an exciting new toy 
may have fooled me into want-
ing McDonald’s, but I know 
better now. As a country, we 
should know better by now too.

or

“Undefeatable” — Young 

Rising Sons

We’ll start out with a pump 

up song: rousing beats, a catchy 
melodic 
line 
and 
fiercely 

empowering 
lyrics 
come 

together to form Young Rising 
Son’s 
“Undefeatable.” 
Lead 

singer Andy Tongren’s voice is 
emphatic and motivational as 
he sings “We are the stars and 
the sun / The unforgettable 
ones.”

“Famous Last Words” — 

My Chemical Romance

“Famous Last Words” holds 

a special place in my heart 
because it was my preferred 
rainy 
day 
song 
of 
choice 

throughout all four years of 
high school. Whenever I feel 
especially down, I can count 
on this song to invigorate me 
again. 
Gerard 
Way’s 
voice 

is candidly passionate as he 
proclaims “I am not afraid 
to keep on living / I am not 
afraid to walk this world 

alone,” an inspiring message 
that is especially important in 
the tumultuous days after the 
election.

“Kill V. Maim” — Grimes
Grimes 
delivers 
an 

energetically 
fast 
paced 

anthem that urges listeners 
to go against the grain. The 
song glorifies rebellion, and 
is 
noticeably 
brighter 
in 

comparison to many of the 
other songs in this playlist, 
due in part to the breathy, 
sometimes 
piercing 
quality 

of 
Grimes’s 
voice. 
Grimes 

champions the weird; most of 
her music videos are downright 
bizarre, yet she always exudes a 
creativity and confidence that 
we all hope to emulate.

“My House” — PVRIS
A 
playlist 
without 
my 

favorite band? PSYCH! YOU 
THOUGHT! All jokes aside, “My 
House” is about reclaiming one’s 
personal space and standing 
up to someone that previously 
seemed unchallengeable. This 
isn’t 
PVRIS’s 
most 
famous 

single for no reason; vocalist 
Lynn Gunn’s voice is vibrant, 
strong and effortlessly smooth.

“Shut Up!” — Simple Plan
When a situation gets to 

be damaging, frustrating or 
disheartening, it can be good 
to take a moment to step out, 
take a deep breath and reaffirm 

yourself. This song perfectly 
captures how one feels when it 
all gets to be too much, while 
simultaneously 
encouraging 

listeners to embrace the unique 
parts of their individuality.

“You’re Going Down” — 

Sick Puppies

“You’re Going Down” is a 

violently intense piece filled 
with ominous, heavy guitar 
and 
seething, 
angry 
lyrics. 

Lead singer Shimon Moore’s 
voice oozes a rich vengefulness 
that comes across in his lyrical 
delivery, especially at the crux 
of the song, when he sings “One 
of us is going / One of us is going 
down” and “You’re the one 
that’s going down.”

“begin again” — Purity 

Ring

Purity Ring is unique for its 

elegantly poetic lyrics, many 
of which come from vocalist 
Megan 
James’s 
personal 

works that were originally 
not intended to be published. 
“Begin Again” is a captivating 
piece from start to finish, with 
a beautiful and distinctive 
underlying bass buildup that 
brings out the delicacy of 
James’s voice. The song is filled 
with references to rebirth and 
renewal, a reminder that there 
will always be good things to 
come, no matter how dark the 
world seems at the moment.

A playlist to help you search for validation in the post-election wake

 The xx are known for mel-
low, chilled-out indie music 
that is beloved by hipsters and 
the mainstream alike. A band 
hailing from London, it’s been 
a few years since we’ve heard 
anything new from them, with 
their last real release in 2012. 
“On Hold” is the lead single 
from their upcoming new 
album, I See You, and the band 
have spent a while apart. With 
Jamie xx having produced 
one of the most accomplished 
albums of 2015 as a solo proj-
ect, there is a lot of expecta-
tion for this new album to 
meet the same standard.
 Something that Jamie’s solo 
album missed however, was 
the joint vocals of both Romy 
Croft and Oliver Sim, a trait of 
The xx that has always made 
them stand out. Throughout 
“On Hold,” the trio swap 
between taking the lead, and 
the lyrics, talking about lost 
love, wouldn’t work without 
the other two singers and 
Jamie brings his top level pro-

duction to the 
table, almost 
as a third 
singer.
 The song 
itself is slow, 
with calm-
ing lyrics and 
delivery, which is nothing 
groundbreaking. However it’s 
the build up and the overall 
sound that is unique to The 
xx. When the song gets going, 
there’s an unusually fast beat, 
but it doesn’t detract from the 
haunting guitars and synths 
that frolic in the background 
of the vocals. This is definitely 
a song that is better listened to 
through headphones.
 It’s also a lot more honest 
and upfront than anything this 
band has produced before. The 
lyrics are bolder, and Jamie 
xx’s production is second to 
none. The sample of the 1981 
hit “I Can’t Go For That (No 
Can Do)” by Hall & Oates 
exemplifies the new areas 
this band is exploring, being 

only the second 
sample the band 
has ever used, 
and the only one 
to really take the 
forefront. The 
sound may be 
more poppy than 

before, but this diminishes 
none of the band’s original 
charm that made them so 
highly acclaimed.
 This band has been away 
for quite some time, and this 
upcoming album has been “in-
the-works” for the better part 
of two years. But this song cer-
tainly presents an intriguing 
insight into what the album 
could entail; a perfect com-
bination of The xx’s patented 
ethereal vocals and slow pace, 
working perfectly in conjunc-
tion with Jamie xx’s beats and 
pop-tinged style that proved so 
successful on In Colour. Let’s 
hope this album is as good as 
this first single.

Motte & Bailey Bookshop has been a Kerrytown staple since 2000.

“Brothels and pharmacies 

make more money, that’s for 
sure,” 
said 
Gene 
Alloway, 

owner 
of 
Motte 
& 
Bailey 

Booksellers, a rare and used 
bookstore on North Fourth 
Avenue. “There’s a saying that 
if you want to make a million 
dollars in books, start with two 
million.”

The brothels and pharmacies 

of 
questionable 
practices 

Alloway 
referred 
to 
are 

more 
than 
just 
lucrative 

businesses: 
they 
apparently 

once operated (although not, 
rather unfortunately, at the 
same time) within the same 
walls as Alloway’s bookstore. 
But if a bookstore seems like 
a mundane follow-up to those 
more salacious ventures, a 

step inside Motte & Bailey 
bookstore puts those concerns 
to rest.

Among 
old 
New 
Yorker 

magazine 
covers, 
children’s 

books and coffee-table-ready 
novels on Rembrandt, Motte 
& Bailey bookstore carries a 
comfortable quaintness that 
feels particularly Ann Arbor 
in nature. The store name is 
playfully 
displayed 
on 
the 

window with words that curl 
back and forth, recalling a 
storefront in a Harry Potter 
film. The actual history of the 
books inside, though, can be a 
bit more vicious than a nose-
less Ralph Fiennes.

According to Alloway, one 

such piece of history that 
passed 
through 
the 
walls 

stands out in particular — an 
original declaration written by 
the University of Michigan’s 
president in the late 19th 
century. In it, the president 
bans University students from 
visiting the local Ann Arbor 
bars because, he says, students 
would tend to have too much 
to drink and find themselves, 
perhaps, too belligerent for the 
collective good. As Alloway 
puts it, “There’d be huge brawls 
right in the middle of the 
street, weekend after weekend, 
between 
the 
University 

students 
and 
the 
German 

workers.”

Alloway’s 
reverence 
for 

history is important in holding 
the store to its niche. For 
a college town filled with 
eclectic bookstores, there’s still 
a carefully curated atmosphere 
to the store, and it’s that 
individualism, Alloway says, 
that makes room for what he 
estimates to be more than 20 
different booksellers in the 
area.

“We all have our slightly 

different focus,” he said. At the 
bottom level, yes, all of us want 
that nice copy of ‘Catcher in the 
Rye’ — all of us would buy the 

first edition and sell it for lots 
of money. But on the day-to-day 
level, we all have our different 
foci.”

This keeps the high supply of 

local bookstores from devolving 
into the kind of intra-trade 
warring that, say, the New York 
Ice Cream Truck Mafia found 
itself in. The local booksellers 
are not, Alloway says, walking 
up to each other’s collections 
with bats or a Zippo lighter.

Rather, Alloway will happily 

direct customers to the local 
bookstore that most fits their 
particular needs. (While I sat 
there, he recommended that 
a young woman searching for 
Jane Austen peruse the West 
Side Book Shop.)

So while Motte & Bailey does 

have an array of material, its 
strength, Alloway says, is still 
based in what he first took to 
the web back in 1996 when he 
opened a website as a book 
seller, focusing mainly on rare 
books in the subjects of classical 
history and the military.

What started solely as an 

online 
enterprise, 
however, 

eventually became a physical 
store in 2000, as Alloway 
and 
two 
friends 
— 
John 

Murphy II and Paul Hare 
— 
found 
themselves 
both 

with an increased interest in 
bookselling and in the midst of 
a philosophical disagreement 
with the University of Michigan 
library, 
where 
Alloway 

worked for a number of years 
as a librarian after receiving 
degrees in classical history and 
librarianship. Alloway uses the 
transition of mediums through 
music as an analogy:

“Whenever there’s a change 

in technology, things get lost,” 
he said. When you went from 
Edison recordings to the first 
vinyl, there were things that 
didn’t come over. And when 
you went from those early 78s, 
the 33s, and 45 RPM vinyls, 
again, not everything came 
over. And then the same way 
cassettes and 8-track tapes and 
CDs and now digital. At every 
step, there are things that are 
unique to whatever mediums 
are available. The University, 
to me, was ignoring that.”

John Murphy eventually left 

the store for law school while 
Paul moved to Kansas, leaving 
Alloway as the sole consistent 
appraiser. But Alloway still 
makes sure to keep the values 
the store was founded on fresh. 
He only scans original copies 
when uploading books online, 
places his focus on the most 
relevant content in a genre 
regardless of publishing date 
or what’s popular at the given 
moment and above all, he tries 
to make bookselling a more 
personal venture, rather than a 
faceless transaction.

That love for the books 

themselves, the leather and not 
just the ink, finds itself in the 
store’s unofficial motto: “Each 
book has its own destiny,” a 
quote that hangs in the back 
of the store. For Alloway, it 
represents the idea that he, as 
a seller, is just a stop on a long 
journey these books will make. 
And those journeys, too, tell 
their own stories.

One recent one in particular 

stands out to Alloway, he says. 
He recently acquired a large 

19th-century volume of the 
female aristocracy in the early 
reign of Victoria, beautifully 
bound and containing steel 
engravings of each woman. 
But two listed in the table of 
contents are absent. Thinking 
the 
error 
might 
just 
be 

individual, he reached out to 
the libraries where the rest of 
the approximately 12 copies 
are held. Of the seven who 
responded, all said the same 
two 
women 
were 
missing. 

It’s those kinds of “So what 
happened?” 
questions 
that 

are so enticing about original 
bookselling 
and 
collecting, 

Alloway said: “The things that 
you could never find out unless 
you literally look through it 
page by page.”

It seems Alloway is not the 

only one who finds in-person 
browsing 
and 
hands-on 

bookkeeping exciting. While 
the 
store 
started 
online, 

in-store sales now far surpass 
online sales. Alloway cites 
the enormous imbalance of 
supply 
over 
demand 
with 

online 
competition 
as 
one 

factor. Another more powerful 
element at play, though, is that 

book buying and browsing is 
an experience, and an often-
personal one that people like 
to have a guide for. Most of us 
can’t traverse an entire map on 
our own.

“It’s about leading people 

into directions,” Alloway says. 
“Someone reads a general book 
on World War II, and then 
they want to read a book on 
a particular battle, and then 
they want to read a book on a 
particular unit and then they 
want to read a biography of 
a general of that unit. That’s 
what’s really nice.”

To 
help 
sort 
through 

the broadness of any given 
category, Alloway says, it’s 
important for the bookseller 
to be able to tell readers, 
“Read this, not that.” As he so 
accurately lays bare, nobody 
has all the time, money or space 
to collect and read every book 
they might want.

If the business of bookselling 

and collecting seems serious, 
it’s because it is. Alloway 
relayed a story to me of a 
German 
family 
he 
worked 

closely with to return a stolen 
manuscript. 
In 
turn, 
they 

told him of their relative, a 
librarian, who hung himself 
because their family estate 
was looted so heavily by the 
Russians during World War II.

“He just couldn’t protect all 

of the books.”

The Motte & Bailey Bookshop 

may not yet be that zealous, but 
it’s an important staple in the 
ever-growing field. As Alloway 
puts it, “There are always small 
gaps that can be filled with 
books.”

‘Cooking for Jeffrey:’ An iconic love 
story between the Gartens and food

From Dartmouth to the Hamptons, romance knows no bounds

Ina Garten is a powerhouse.
When the Food Network train 

hit new heights of popularity 
in 
the 
mid-aughts, 
Garten 

reached a new level of celebrity 
status attained by only a few 
other chefs on the network. 
Her long-running 
series, 
“Barefoot 

Contessa,” 
has 

been on air since 
2002, making it 
one of the longest 
running series on 
the network.

In 
each 

episode, 
Garten 

is 
effortlessly 

charming as she 
cooks a meal for 
a special guest — 
be it friends, a celebrity or her 
longtime husband, Jeffrey. Ina 
and Jeffrey’s relationship has 
reached an almost cult status, 
as the pair (who have been 
married since 1968) have a 
chemistry that would make any 
cynic a believer in true love. 
When so many marriages end in 
divorce these days, how can we 
not rally around a couple who 
has made it work for almost 50 
years?

It was no surprise, then, 

that Garten’s 10th cookbook, 
released last month, is titled 
“Cooking 
for 
Jeffrey.” 
The 

glossy 
hardcover 
is 
two 

parts 
cookbook, 
one 
part 

love story. The introduction 
traces the history of Garten’s 
relationship with cooking and 
her relationship with Jeffrey. 
The two things are inextricably 
interconnected, Garten says. 
According to her, Jeffrey was 
the one who encouraged her to 
work in the food industry and 
pursue her dreams in the public 
sphere.

Jeffrey is no stranger to 

attaining lofty goals himself; 
he’s Dean Emeritus at the Yale 
School of Management, and has 
worked in several presidential 
administrations. 
Not 
to 
be 

outdone 
by 
her 
husband, 

Garten 
has 
an 
extremely 

impressive resume from before 
her venture into the food world. 
She worked in the White House 
during the Ford and Carter 
administrations writing policy 
papers on nuclear energy. In 

the words of Garten herself, 
“how great is that?”

On first glance, I joked to 

my friends that the title of 
the cookbook seemed bad for 
feminism. I never thought badly 
about Ina for it — Garten is old 
enough to be my grandmother, 
and I am well aware of how 
gender roles have shifted since 
she was in college. However, I 

was surprised to 
see her actually 
tackle the topic 
of feminism in 
her introduction: 
“I 
often 
say 

[Jeffrey] was the 
first 
feminist 

I 
ever 
knew; 

he 
believed 

that 
I 
could 

do 
anything 
I 

wanted to do.”

The 
couple’s 

mutually beneficial relationship 
is highlighted several times in 
“Cooking for Jeffrey.” It’s one 
thing to see their relationship 
on television, where Ina is 
queen 
of 
the 
kitchen 
and 

Jeffrey seems happy just to 
be on the receiving end of her 
production. It’s a completely 
different thing to read Garten’s 
heartfelt gratitude for finding 
a relationship that allows both 
people to follow their goals 
while loving each other deeply.

While 
flipping 
through 

“Cooking with Jeffrey,” I was 
fascinated that not only did 
every recipe sound delicious, 
but 
they 
all 
looked 
like 

something I, an amateur home 
cook, could whip up without 
too much trouble. One of the 
reasons Ina Garten has become 
a Food Network icon is her 
penchant 
for 
simple 
meals 

that require ingredients you 
probably have in your fridge. 
While there are recipes that 
require a thoughtfully planned 
grocery run (“Fried Oysters 
with Lemon Saffron Aioli,” for 
instance), most of the recipes 
are 
something 
you 
could 

easily make with a few hours 
notice. In Ina’s recount of her 
culinary history, she explains 
that she finds the best meals 
are often the simplest, coming 
from perfected classic recipes. 
This explains the prevalence 
of meals with humble names 
like 
“Roast 
Chicken 
with 

Radishes,” “Parmeasan Roasted 
Zucchini,” and “Roasted Italian 

Meatballs.”

For a television personality, 

Garten has done a wonderful 
job making her audience feel 
like they share an intimate 
connection with her. Skimming 
through the blurbs written at 
the top of each recipe, I found 
myself reading some of her 
iconic phrases in her voice, 
like I was watching the recipe 
unfold on her show (“How 
smart is that?”). It’s hard to 
tell if you want her to be your 
grandmother, or your mother, 
or your Hampton neighbor. 
But the overwhelming reaction 
is that her fans do want her 
in their life in some capacity 
because she seems like such a 
fun and friendly person. Her 
voice translates nicely from 
“Barefoot Contessa” to her 
cookbooks, a hard-to-achieve 
skill that has certainly been 
perfected from years in the 
business.

Sitting down with “Cooking 

for Jeffrey” is the reading 
equivalent of curling up in 
a blanket next to a fire — 
the warmth Ina has for her 
husband and her love for 
cooking 
radiates 
off 
every 

page. Even for the biggest 
skeptic, there is something 
beautiful about hearing how 
two people fell (and stayed) 
in love. “Cooking for Jeffrey” 
not only offers a glimpse into 
the first few years of Ina and 
Jeffrey’s relationship, but you 
can rest easy knowing the story 
has a happy ending almost five 
decades later.

As Garten reminds us in her 

“Planning a Party” chapter, food 
is no fun unless you’re sharing 
it with the people you love, be 
it friends, family or Jeffrey. 
Cooking for others is a selfless 
act that can be deeply personal, 
and the ritual of sharing a meal 
is only productive if we’re 
building on our relationship 
with 
that 
person 
through 

conversation 
and 
laughter. 

Though especially important 
in this political climate, this 
lesson is something that each 
and every one of us should hold 
deeply. Besides, if we learn 
anything about sustaining a 
marriage from Ina and Jeffrey’s 
relationship, 
it’s 
undeniable 

that sharing lots of delicious 
meals has only helped.

 In the wake of the 2016 
election, millions of Americans 
are hurting. They’re scared 
for themselves, their friends, 
their families, even complete 
strangers. Also in the wake of 
Trump’s win, we’ve seen an 
uptick in blatant hate; this week 
alone three women have been 
attacked or “intimidated” in 
Ann Arbor — a liberal Mecca 
of sorts in comparison to much 
of the country. Nonetheless, 
when the darkness seems to be 
the darkest it has been in recent 
years, the brightness shines 
even brighter.
 Alicia Keys and A$AP 
Rocky vibing in a backyard to 
“Blended Family (What You 
Do For Love),” the lead single 
off Keys’s new album Here, 
exudes that brightness. The 
video’s three and a half minutes 

are a collage of 
Keys’s family, 
including 
husband Swizz 
Beats, their 
children, as 
well as Swizz’s 
ex-wife and 
their children (Keys’s step-
children), intermingled with 
other blended families from all 
walks of life. The energy bubbles 
with love and affection, further 
enhanced by the song’s simple 
yet uplifting guitar chords and 
honest commentary and relaxed 
delivery from the songstress.
The video’s energy, powered by 
adoring looks and slow-motion 
hugs, overflows with Rocky’s 
verse. He begins pacing, rapping 
into a notebook while jotting 
down lyrics and the smiles 
only grow wider and more 

infectious from 
there. He kisses 
his step mom on 
her cheek and 
a room erupts 
into laughter 
as he delivers, 
“And shoutout 

to the step sisters and the step 
brothers / And god-sisters, who 
eventually slept with us.”
 Still, the video’s peak, without 
a doubt, is Keys and Rocky 
stunting together, feeding into 
each other’s energy, each other’s 
smiles. She mouths his verse as 
he flows next to her, their bodies 
lost in the music rather than 
choreographed around it. The 
track and video serve as a much 
needed reminder: “I know how 
hard it gets / But I swear it’s 
worth it, worth it.”

Check out this blazer I just got at the Givenchy sample sale.

Last 
week, 
a 
relentless 

paranoia consumed my life as 
I prepared to direct a live talk 
show in my media production 
class. 
For 
exactly 
three 

minutes, I would take my turn 
in the director’s chair, giving 
commands 
while 
juggling 

three cameras, audio, graphics 
and cues to the talent. I was to 
follow a semi-scripted outline 
and make decisions on the fly, 
while my professor silently 
jotted down notes behind me. 
It was all very stressful and 
very much outside my comfort 
zone, because, for the neurotic 
planner that I am, “live” is a 
four letter word.

I’m sure all nine students 

in my production class were 
nervous for their directing 
rotation. I was. I watched 
as each individual’s nerves 
surfaced in their own ways; 
fingers twisted in hair, bitten 
nails, cracking knuckles. There 
was another tell, one that 
exactly half the class employed: 
the disclaimer. Sorry if this 
sucks. I’m totally gonna mess 
up. I apologize in advance.

The 
students 
who 
used 

disclaimers, I noticed, were 
exclusively women.

I recognize that my sample 

size is small, but even so, I find 
it extremely unlikely that this 
was an isolated coincidence. 
The fact is, all four women in my 
class preemptively disqualified 
their abilities as directors in 
some capacity, while the four 
men did not.

Disclaimers act as a sort of 

defense mechanism, a way to 
show self-awareness in your 
uncertainties and ensure that 
you don’t appear overconfident 
or pompous. They are used to 
acknowledge that you’re not 
blind to your imperfections or 
insusceptible to mistakes. But 
a thought prefaced with,“This 
may be a bad idea, but…” is not 
nearly as convincing as the 
same one without.

So why is there a gender 

disparity in confidence? Maybe, 
perhaps even subconsciously, 
the women in my film and 
television 
classes 
are 
less 

confident 
in 
their 
abilities 

simply because they haven’t 
seen many women take on 
high-powered 
positions 
in 

the industry. It’s no secret 
that Hollywood is an old boys 
club; any list of the industry’s 
“greats” will be overcrowded 
with old, white men. In the 
timeline of film and television, 
relatively few women have 
risen to great acclaim in the 
stereotypically male dominated 
roles of directors, producers, 
screenwriters and the like.

History has not cultivated 

many 
female 
role 
models, 

but there has been enormous 
progress. Throughout the past 

decade, incredible women have 
been able to break through 
Hollywood’s 
glass 
ceiling, 

successfully 
writing 
scripts, 

directing shows and running 
studios. And the women that 
are 
breaking 
through 
the 

boundaries are confident in 
their abilities and stand by 
their ideas. No disclaimers.

It’s infinitely easier to go 

along with the status quo. 
When 
predominantly 
men 

raised their hands in my Art 
of Film class last semester, 
I noticed the trend, but did 
nothing. I, like many, didn’t 
want to say something wrong 
or divisive, was not willing 
to run the risk of looking 
bad. I only got up the courage 
to speak one time in that 
lecture: ironically, when the 
class was having a passionate 
debate about producer, author 
and 
showrunner 
Shonda 

Rhimes. I talked about her 
dedication to blind casting, 
her movement to normalize 
minorities 
through 
her 

storylines and her persistence 
to 
grow 
opportunities 
for 

women within the industry. 
Her 
success, 
dazzling 
and 

inspiring, gave me confidence 
to overcome the perceptions of 
my own shortcomings.

The only way that progress 

can 
continue 
is 
if 
young 

women 
take 
initiative. 
It 

starts in the classroom, in our 
student organizations, in our 
internships. It’s time we take 
on projects that may be outside 
our comfort zones and have the 
confidence that somehow, we’ll 
figure it out. It’s time to stop 
saying we can’t before we even 
try.

In 2016, young female filmmakers 
shouldn’t need to give disclaimers

Instead of apologizing, women going into film should feel empowered

Last week, 
a relentless 
paranoia 

consumed my life.

Check out my gloves, I just got them at the ACNE sample sale.

Action movies are more than 

just car chases. In the debris of 
every explosion, we find answers 
to questions that form the crux of 
human society: Who is the enemy? 
Why do we fight them? What 
distinguishes them from us?

Historically, 
action 
movie 

tropes have evolved alongside 
American foreign policy and 
global trade relations. We once had 
the Godfather and bands of Italian 
mobsters. Then came Russian 
gangsters and spies. Now we’re 
boarding private jets to coolly 
futuristic 
Asian 
metropolises, 

shooting at each other from the 
glittering towers of Shanghai, 
Tokyo, Hong Kong or Macau and 
sipping a cocktail in the hotel bar 
afterward.

We see this in “Fast and Furious: 

Tokyo 
Drift,” 
“Pacific 
Rim,” 

“Transformers: Age of Extinction” 
and more. Even less action-based 
thrillers jumpstart their plotlines 
with an injection of foreign travel, 
like “Contagion,” which began in a 
Hong Kong casino. “Skyfall,” one 
of the highest grossing films in 
the past few years, continues the 
James Bond legacy in a Shanghai 
skyscraper 
and 
the 
fictional 

Golden Dragon Casino in Macau.

For 
“Skyfall,” 
screenwriter 

John 
Logan 
explained 
that 

production deliberately sought out 
locations that were “in opposition” 
to London with an exotic quality 
that made them “places for Bond 
to be uncomfortable.”

But it’s not just Bond that’s 

uncomfortable. So is the audience, 
a presumed monolithic body of 
English-speaking, 
non-ethnic 

Westerners. It is this discomfort — 
this newness, foreignness — that 
creates the movie’s thrill. These 

cities are meant to be unfamiliar, 
harkening back to our most primal 
instinct to fear the unknown.

The dynamic is not limited 

to Asian cities alone. Action 
movie franchises take viewers 
all over the world, from Latin 
America to the Middle East, 
precisely 
because 
foreignness 

is inherently suspenseful. For 
Western audiences — particularly 
American ones — Asia has the 
stereotype of being perpetually 
foreign, taking the feeling of thrill 
even further.

Moreover, 
because 
the 

audience 
generally 
does 
not 

have 
first-person 
experience 

visiting 
international 
cities, 

screenwriters have the freedom 
of imagining whatever they want 
to fill that blank space. Asian 
cities, specifically, are tied to 
the image of high-tech futurism 
and consumerism, making them 
places where slick new gadgets, sly 
transactions, anything the mind 
can conjure up, flourish.

The setting is also about money, 

and characterizing protagonists 
along certain class lines. Notably, 
Bond 
doesn’t 
dally 
in 
the 

agricultural fields of Southeast 
Asia — those are reserved for 
stories of ancient treasures or 
war-related espionage. Instead, 
he only visits Asia’s economic 
powerhouses, and of those, only 
the cities that have the strongest 
trade relations with the US and 
the UK.

Here, his enemies are wealthy 

Asian businessmen or Western 
expats. His choice of associates — 
even in the villains he fights — is 
just one physical marker of Bond’s 
status as a sleek, cosmopolitan 
protagonist. He has his Armani 
suit, his Rolex and, now, the 
international network connecting 
him to pockets of power across the 
globe. He has both the financial 

means and the elite connections 
to jetset between London and 
New York, and now Shanghai 
and Macau. The plot is no longer 
just domestic. The more foreign 
backdrops the movie has, the 
grander the scale of the action, 
creating ever-higher stakes to 
indulge in.

There also is a real-world 

political and financial element in 
the trend of setting blockbuster 
action movies in Asia. Lately, 
Chinese investors have funneled 
a lot of money into Hollywood 
media 
companies, 
and 
Asia 

is a growing market for these 
action 
movies. 
The 
latest 

“Transformers” 
movie 
was 

heavily promoted in China and 
became the country’s highest 
grossing film at the time of 
release.

Some production companies 

respond to this new audience by 
creating special export versions 
of the film with after-edits 
making 
the 
storylines 
more 

relatable to Chinese viewers. It 
could be that now, writers are 
moving the entire stories to Asia 
— an artistic decision fueled by 
the global economic market.

But 
in 
practice, 
these 

international locations are used as 
nothing more than backdrops for 
(usually) American protagonists 
to play in. Instead of using the 
setting to shape the plot, it seems 
that it’s simply thrown in as 
an afterthought to add extra 
stimulation for audiences and 
production companies alike.

Since movies are a mirror 

reflection of society, it means we 
as viewers have an underlying 
mindset that enables this type 
of cinematic ethnocentrism. We 
should question why that mindset 
is so common and ask ourselves: 
are we making backdrops of 
foreign places in our own lives?

Considering the action 
movie as a mirror for life
