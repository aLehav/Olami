More than 150 students and 

faculty gathered at the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art on 
Thursday evening to attend “The 
Art of Fashion,” a bicentennial 
birthday 
bash 
event, 
which 

featured an exposition displaying 
fashion 
throughout 
recent 

decades, with a focus on vintage 
clothing. 

This event was co-hosted by 

campus organizations MUSIC 
Matters, 
EnspiRED, 
NOiR 

Runway Fashion, Bronze Elegance 
and SHEI Magazine. This is the 
third annual SpringFest fashion 
show and the first collective event 
between these prominent fashion 
organizations on campus.

Ross sophomore Ayla Ahmed, 

a co-organizer of the event 
and SpingFest senior producer, 
introduced the exhibition and 
spoke about the origins of the 
show.

“It was originally devised by 

MUSIC Matters as a means to 
unite the fashion community on 
campus,” she said.

The show featured twenty 

models half from Bronze Elegance 
and half from NOiR Runway 
Fashion. Each of the four themes 
featured five models. The first 
part of the show launched into 
an upbeat Renaissance-inspired 
theme.

Following, 
an 
Asian-fusion 

theme was introduced. This 
theme inspired by Asian-inspired 
tradition.

The 
third 
theme 
was 

represented by exclusively male 
models, displaying themes of the 
present, taking on a more modern 
and simplistic approach.

Concluding the exhibition was 

the finale, “Visions of the Future.”

Aaron 
Pelo, 
editor-in-chief 

of SHEI Magazine, expressed 
his 
enthusiasm 
for 
working 

collaboratively 
with 
the 

UMMA and the other fashion 
organizations.

“The 
other 
fashion 

organizations are the best of the 

best,” he said. “It’s absolutely 
inspiring to be in their company 
because they all run such good 
shows. Working with the UMMA 
was such a real pleasure for me, 
and I think for everybody, just 
because they’re such visionaries 
here. I think the final show was 
really a knockout.”

Ahmed was also impressed by 

the final product.

“The SpringFest fashion show 

in the past has always been held 
in the Diag,” she said. “But this 
year UMMA approached us 

about partnering with them, and 
I think this has been immensely 
successful, having it in this artistic 
space, and being able to have the 
clothes influenced by the artwork 
around us.”

LSA junior Yiwen Lin said this 

was her second year attending 
the fashion show, and she was 
impressed by the change in 
scenery.

“In the museum, we have 

a different context,” she said. 
“It’s really cool. It works very 
well.”

A pair of bills creating new 

tax incentives for businesses 
employing Michigan residents 
is moving to the Michigan 
House of Representatives after 
the state Senate passed it by a 
32-5 vote Wednesday.

Under the bills, nicknamed 

the “Good Jobs for Michigan” 
program, 
businesses 
with 

at least 250 new employees 
making at least 125 percent of 
the annual average wage for 
their region would be able to 
keep up to 100 percent of the 
income taxes taken out of their 
employees’ paychecks for 10 
years. Businesses with at least 
500 new employees making at 
least 100 percent of the average 
wage would receive up to a 50 
percent abatement lasting five 
years. The state is divided 
into 10 prosperity regions, 
for which the average wage is 
calculated independently, but 
the average salary for the state 
as a whole is about $45,000.

Specifically, 
the 
bills 

authorize

Deir Yassin Remembered, 

a 
local 
group 
famous 
for 

its weekly protests outside 
Temple Beth Israel in Ann 
Arbor, has been placed on a list 
of hate groups compiled by the 
Southern Poverty Law Center 
under 
the 
subcategory 
of 

Holocaust denial. According to 
the Washtenaw Jewish News, 
Deir Yassin Remembered is 
“the only sustained action 
targeting a Jewish house of 
worship 
anywhere 
in 
the 

United States.”

Mark 
Potok, 
editor-in-

chief of the SPLC’s quarterly 
journal, explained the addition 
in 
a 
recent 
interview 
on 

Michigan Radio, stating the 
group defended Nazism.

“We list them because over 

the years they have come 
to more and more explicitly 
embrace real-life Holocaust 
denial,” he said. “The kind of 
Holocaust denial that these 
people practice is essentially 
a defense of Germany and 
National Socialism.”

student 

Vikrant Garg, co-organizer of 
activist group Students4Justice, 
said he never really felt safe in 
the Michigan Union until the 
activist group posed its sit-in 
there in February.

“It really allowed me to 

imagine what an activist center 
that centered people of color and 
marginalized 
students 
could 

look like,” he said. 

In a different sphere of 

activism, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Amanda Delekta, the author 
of 
the 
#NotMyCampus 

petition that received over 300 
signatures, penned the letter to 
alert the University of Michigan 
that many conservative students 
didn’t feel at home or included in 
the political conversation.

“I 
think 
#NotMyCampus 

accomplished its main purpose 
in first identifying there is 
a 
significant 
conservative 

population 
on 
campus 
and 

then creating a platform for 

conservative students to speak 
out on following the election,” 
she said. 

Though Delekta and Garg 

differ in their methods of 
activism, both are examples 
of 
students 
involved 
with 

the multiple protests, sit-ins 
and 
petitions 
that 
cropped 

up following the incendiary 
presidential election. Though 
months have passed since the 
election, in terms of activism, 
neither student feels like their 
job is done.

“I think since the election, 

the University has tried to 
create forums for students to 
participate in,” Delekta said. 
“However, I still think there is 
a long way to go before we reach 
a place where students of all 
ideologies are able to respect one 
another.”

Students4Justice 
aims 
to 

combat oppression and injustice 
on campus. After the election, 
the club hosted multiple sit-ins 
and outlined a list of demands 
calling for the University to 
respond to bias incidents on 

Activists aim 
to promote 
unity despite 
 

differences

New collection compiles over 200,000 pages, 316 volumes spanning 125 years

Twelve decades of student 

reporting, 
316 
volumes 
of 

breaking coverage and 200,000 
pages of University of Michigan 
news were revealed Thursday 
night as the Bentley Historical 
Library unveiled 125 years’ 
worth of digitized archives of 
The Michigan Daily.

The Daily has been a facet 

on campus since 1890 and has 
covered both national and local 

issues such as politics, social 
movements, higher education 
and changing demographics of 
the University.

The event was attended by 

student journalists, alumni and 
prominent University leaders — 
including University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
James 

and Anne Duderstadt, former 
University president and vice 
president, respectively. Prior 
to the digitization, previous 
issues of the Daily could only be 
viewed in person at the Bentley 
or at the Student Publications 

Building, where only bound 
paper copies are available.

Now, 
however, 
the 
new 

database, consisting of digital 
preservation 
and 
online 

infrastructure of the Daily from 
1890 to 2014, eliminates the 
need to view physical copies and 
makes all the Daily’s content 
searchable 
and 
browsable 

for alumni, researchers and 
historians alike.

The 
financial 
support 
of 

the Kemp Family Foundation 
is largely responsible for the 
digitization.

John B. Kemp, who attended 

the University as both an 
undergraduate and law student 
in the ’60s, has vast familial 
roots at the University and 
wanted to be able to view his 
time at the University through 
digital records of the Daily.

The Bentley has archived 

similarly pertinent materials, 
particularly 
historical 

documents, 
student 
records, 

maps 
and 
University 

intercollegiate 
athletics 

documentation.

More than 122,000 University of Michigan email “.edu” 

addresses are available for sale on the internet, according to a 
report from Digital Citizens Alliance, a nonprofit organization 
focused on internet safety, as reported by the Detroit Free Press.

These addresses are harvested by hackers and put up for sale 

on the Dark Web, also referred to as the darknet, which is an 
internet network that can only be accessed with certain software 
or connections where illegal goods can be peddled, the Free Press 
reported.

Brian Dunn, managing partner of ID Agent, the company that 

gathered the data for the report, said the hacked addresses could 
potentially be used to steal peoples’ identities or trick others into 
giving up information, the Free Press reported.

“What is more trusted than an e-mail coming from a ‘.edu’ 

address?” Dunn said. “They can be used to launch malware or 
Trojan horse attacks, because people might be more willing to 
click on an e-mail coming from an ‘.edu’ e-mail address, thinking 
it’s real.”

These Trojan horse attacks function by tricking users into 

launching a program, then unleashing a virus onto a computer 
using the intent to steal further information.

In the report, the University topped the list of schools by 

number of email accounts available for sale on the darknet, while 
Michigan State University was fourth on the list with about 
116,000 “.edu” addresses available.

Students are annoyed by the 

various construction projects 
around campus that obstruct 
their walks to class — many of 
which will not be completed 
in time for current University 
of Michigan students to take 
advantage of them.

Some recent changes to the 

campus landscape that have 
been completed are the new 
Biological 
Science 
Building, 

opening in summer 2018, which 
will 
house 
the 
University’s 

Museum of Natural History and 
Weiser Hall, which will open 
this summer and will house the 
Department of Astronomy and 
LSA’s International Institute. 

LSA junior Claire Bartosic 

shared how the closing of the 
sidewalks near Weiser Hall 
continues to make an impact on 

her walk to class. 

“On a daily basis, construction 

can often get in the way of just 
walking,” Bartosic said. “It’s not 
as bad now, but last year, when it 
was all closed off, you couldn’t 
easily walk.”

The renovations at Weiser 

Hall also put a strain on students 
who had classes there and 
needed to get to their next class 
on time.

“Having 
to 
walk 
around 

the construction was super 
annoying and almost made me 
late a couple times,” said LSA 
sophomore Kate Bishop.

Currently, over $986.1 million 

is planned to be spent among 
13 major construction projects 
currently underway across the 
campus, not including current 
projects on the University’s 
Medical 
Campus, 
smaller 

renovations 
and 
recently 

completed 
projects. 
Of 
the 

running total, $102.6 million 

of funding of the construction 
projects will come from the 
Student Life Student Fee paid 
with student tuition.

Of the student tuition money, 

a 
portion 
will 
go 
toward 

renovations of the Michigan 
Union and the North Campus 
Recreation Building. Some new 
features for the Union include 
the enclosure of the courtyard 
on the main level for year-round 
usage and a new open-concept 
layout. The NCRB will gain 
expanded weight and training 
rooms.

An estimated total of 934,600 

gross 
square 
feet 
will 
be 

constructed in new buildings and 
building additions, along with 
the renovations, an estimated 
total of 608,500 square feet 
of existing buildings around 
campus will be renovated.

The sidewalk leading to the 

Hill Neighborhood from Central 
Campus, where new Biological 

Science Building is located, 
would 
often 
be 
closed 

during the initial stages of 
construction and required 
students to find alternate — 
often longer — routes to class.

“When I lived on the Hill 

last year and had to walk 
through 
the 
walkway, 
I 

would leave earlier just in 
case the walkway was closed, 
which happened like twice,” 
said Bishop.

Last 
year, 
with 
the 

construction 
of 
the 
new 

addition to the Ross School 
of Business, many residents 
of East Quad Residence Hall 
felt the construction had a 
largely negative impact on 
their experience.

LSA 
junior 
Sophia 

Davidson 
shared 
how 

the 
sheer 
noise 
of 
the 

construction 
influenced 

her academic and personal 
experience at the University.

Construction across campus leads 
to vast complaints among students

campus.

Garg said the demands posed 

by Students4Justice will work 
as a checklist for what the 
University needs to fulfill.

“We will continue to do 

everything necessary to fulfill 
the demands from September, 
reintroduced during the sit-in,” 
Garg said.

LSA 
freshman 
Charde 

Madoula-Bey, an organizer of a 
police brutality protest, agreed, 
saying activism will end when 
the University makes tangible 
improvements, not when the 
activists become tired.

“Because of the lack of 

change, I believe that activism 
is always needed when the 
demand for justice is not met, 
so until there is a change in the 
social climate towards minority 
groups on campus, I promote all 
activism,” she said.

While 
political 
activism 

is usually seen in a positive 
light, especially when dealing 
with 
younger 
generations, 

LSA freshman Tiana Brandon, 
finance chair of S4J, said though 
the organization will be working 
hard to fulfill its long-term goals, 
she hopes nothing will warrant 
a political protest in the future.

“I am sure, based on the 

current 
behavior 
already 

portrayed by the incoming class 
of 2021 and all of the political 
turmoil in the country, that 
something else will happen 
and a similar protest will take 
place,” Brandon said. “However, 
I would like to stay hopeful that 
an event will not occur that 
requires such response.”

Madoula-Bey 
agreed 
and 

said, though activism is positive, 
it is also an indication of large-
scale issues, which she said are 
becoming more prevalent on 
campus.

“As far as any shift in the 

political climate, specifically on 
campus, the climate has become 
negative,” Medoula-Bey said. 
“The racism and discrimination 
has 
been 
becoming 
more 

blatant since the election. But 
for minority groups, there has 

been a prevailing mood of hope 
amongst our communities.”

As expressed in many of the 

protests, the current power 
ratios 
in 
Washington, 
with 

President Donald Trump in the 
White House and a conservative-
controlled Congress, can be 
a major obstacle or cause for 
discouragement among young 
activists.

However, 
Engineering 

senior Keanu Richardson, who 
organized the protest outside 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s home following the 
racist and anti-semetic emails 
sent to students, said now is not 
the time to give up or ignore the 
issues.

“The change we want to see 

on campus probably won’t be 
seen by anyone who’s on campus 
right now,” Richardson said. 
“But now’s not the time to get 
discouraged, but motivated to 
make sure that this campus is 
better for future generations.”

Richardson 
added 
change 

does not have to come from 
large-scale protests. He said the 
personal relationships he has 
formed have been some of the 
most conducive to change.

“I will say that students 

need to stop equating people 
to 
institutions,” 
Richardson 

said. “President Schlissel isn’t 
a bad guy. He’s very genuine 
and wants to help, but he also 
understands the limitations that 
he has in his role as a leader of an 
institution. I would say that the 
same goes for a lot of members of 
administration.”

Moving forward, Richardson 

said he hopes student activism 
can be more aware of its context 
within a nation that is inevitably 
more diverse than our campus. 
He said ignorance can be avoided 
by becoming more “teachable.”

“You have people who have 

convinced 
themselves 
that 

change is happening because 
of a bubble they created,” 
Richardson said. “If I unfriend 
or block everyone who has a 
different opinion than me, then 
all I’m going to see are people 
rallying toward my cause. I’ll 
convince myself that the world is 
changing because I’ve severely 
limited who’s in my world, and 
now I can only see what I want 

to see.”

Madoula-Bey, 
who 
has 

planned an April march and 
speak 
out 
against 
human 

trafficking, said she doesn’t 
see student activism waning 
anytime 
soon, 
considering 

the number of issues — such 
as climate change and lack of 
minority voice — she would like 
to see addressed.

Regardless of the purpose 

or 
the 
agitator 
or 
even 

effectiveness, 
Delekta 
said 

the recent student activism is 
inherently positive, and hopes it 
continues.

“I love to see so many 

students 
engaging 
in 
their 

civil 
freedoms 
to 
express 

their opinions,” Delekta said. 
“Insofar as protests that do 
not infringe on the freedoms 
of others, I think that student 
protests are an inspiring symbol 
of the political activism within 
our generation.”

On the other side of the 

debate, 
more 
conservative 

students participate in forms 
of 
activism, 
despite 
being 

an ideological minority on 
campus.

LSA 
sophomore 
Ashley 

Calcagno, 
who 
signed 
the 

#NotMyCampus 
petition, 

explained her perspective of 
campus as a conservative.

“Part 
of 
attending 
the 

University of Michigan, as a 
conservative, is understanding 
that 
you 
are 
entering 
an 

environment 
where 
the 

majority of your peers have 
differing political ideologies,” 
she said.

Calcagno 
added, 
while 

protests 
often 
facilitate 

awareness, 
they 
don’t 

necessarily bring about change. 
For Calcagno, the role of the 
University is not to behave as a 
political actor.

“As for the future, I would 

like to see the University 
continue 
to 
work 
toward 

equally including the feelings 
and emotions of people on both 
sides of the political spectrum,” 
she said.

Regardless, Calcagna said 

if need arises, an appropriate 
response to any bias furthered 
by the University should be 
expected.

Terrence McDonald, director 

of the Bentley, spoke to nearly 
100 attendees at the Gerald R. 
Ford Library on Thursday about 
the significance of the digital 
documentation of the Daily.

In an interview beforehand, 

McDonald said the digitization 
project involved partnerships 
across multiple units at the 
University, including the Bentley, 
the IT department of the Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library and 
the Student Publications. The 
resulted is an archive that holds 
huge implications for future 
understanding of the University.

“A great university, to stay 

great, has to maintain a high level 
of 
historical 
consciousness,” 

McDonald said. “We have a 
great history; certain members 
of our community know about 
that history, but the world 
beyond that needs to know more 
about that.”

Though 
the 
project 
was 

completed last October, the data 
was originally only released to 
faculty and students involved 
in bicentennial-themed courses 
last December.

“The idea of digitizing the 

Daily was, to begin with, a way 
of getting the story out; that 
is, the digital initiative of the 
Daily is already crafting more 
scholarship on the history of 
the University of Michigan in 
the last three months with its 
very limited release than we’ve 
produced than in the previous 
multiple years,” he said.

McDonald, 
who 
has 
27 

students in his bicentennial-
themed course “22 Ways to 
Think about the History of The 
University of Michigan,” said 
his students have already made 
great use of the archives in their 
research.

“The 
Daily, 
because 
of 

its 
editorial 
independence, 

its daily publication and its 
journalistic 
ambition 
— 
it’s 

just a phenomenal newspaper 
of record of the history of the 
University,” McDonald said.

At the release, McDonald 

introduced Kemp, who spoke 
about the significance of the 
archives with regard to his 
extensive 
family 
background 

with the University and the 
memorializing of students’ time.

“It’ll allow a lot of people that 

had great memories at Michigan 

to be able to have tangible 
evidence of that by getting a 
Michigan Daily article about 
it,” Kemp said. “Once you get to 
Michigan, you build memories 
that will last you a lifetime, you 
make friends that will last you a 
lifetime.”

Kemp spoke of his foundation’s 

generosity for the program as a 
form of repayment for what the 
University has given his family.

“For four generations, our 

family members have received 
the many benefits of being 
University of Michigan people,” 
Kemp 
said. 
“I 
really 
don’t 

want you to remember, I don’t 
want you to note or recollect 
everything I said today. I just 
want you to remember all of 
those things I described. If 
you 
insist 
on 
remembering 

something I said, then let me ask 
that you remember the last two 
words: Go Blue.”

Afterward, Schlissel spoke, 

musing 
on 
his 
time 
as 
a 

student journalist at Princeton 
University. Schlissel credited 
his 
experience 
reporting 
as 

preparation 
for 
his 
career 

as 
University 
president. 

Princeton’s student publication, 
the 
Princetonian, 
recently 

digitized its archives, something 
Schlissel noted has allowed him 
to reflect on his time as a college 
student and hopes the Daily’s 
archives will do the same.

“The 
new 
archives 
we’re 

celebrating tonight represent 
an 
important 
milestone 
in 

University of Michigan student 
journalism,” Schlissel said. “In a 
place like the U of M, a chronicle 
of our university is also a record 
of 
the 
larger 
society. 
This 

project exemplifies the culture 
of innovation that is thriving 
throughout our university.”

Schlissel 
then 
performed 

the first official online search 
of the Daily’s digital archives, 
searching for a column written 
by former Daily columnist Haya 
Alfarhan titled, “Sit with your 
differences.”

“When privileged individuals 

are unwilling to interrogate 
their 
internalized 
biases 

because 
it 
makes 
them 

uncomfortable, 
it 
forces 

students 
with 
marginalized 

identities to trigger themselves 
emotionally to make a point,” 
Alfarhan wrote in the column. 
“Privileged comfort comes at the 
cost of triggering marginalized 
students. Students who trigger 
themselves to do so because 
these topics consume their lives 

and a lack of discourse in class 
is genuinely painful for them … 
Yes, professors should be able to 
facilitate their class discussions 
better, but it’s also students’ 
responsibility 
to 
engage 

wholeheartedly.”

Following Schlissel’s remarks, 

a panel spoke, consisting of LSA 
senior Shoham Geva, editor-in-
chief of the Daily for the 2016-
2017 academic year, Neil Chase, 
executive editor of The Mercury 
News in addition to being chair 
of 
the 
Student 
Publications 

Board and Philip Power, founder 
of The Center for Michigan, a 
nonprofit organization aimed 
at curing statewide political 
culture.

The panelists — moderated by 

McDonald — discussed a number 
of topics, primarily challenges 
in the field. Power experienced 
issues with regard to coverage 
of the Dean of Women and the 
Vietnam War; Chase, however, 
experienced financial barriers 
when the Daily shifted from 
being a paid publication to 
free 
distribution 
under 
his 

tenure 
and 
Geva 
discussed 

the challenges she faced with 
diversity 
and 
entering 
the 

digital age. 

Power 
highlighted 
the 

entrepreneurial 
attempts 
of 

nonprofit journalism.

“The Daily is what honed 

our interest and our capacity 
to take complex things and put 
them into sensible pros and 
argumentative politics,” Power 
said. “There is not enough 
money 
in 
the 
philanthropic 

ecosystem to fund and sustain 
nonprofit 
journalism 
in 
the 

scope and intensity that we need 
in order to save this country.”

Ultimately, 
the 
panelists 

concluded with a discussion of 
maintaining public engagement 
in current political context.

Micheline 
Maynard, 
Daily 

alum 
and 
Knight-Wallace 

fellow for 1999-2000, said in 
an interview after the event 
the 
archives 
serve 
multiple 

purposes that will be beneficial 
to many communities.

“This is going to be an 

incredibly 
valuable 
resource 

for those of us who write books, 
those of us who are interested in 
journalism and especially those 
of us who were born in Ann 
Arbor, because this is a tool for 
us to look back on our town,” 
Maynard said. “It’s very rare to 
find an archive this complete 
and that goes back as far as it 
does.”

revenues from the state to 
businesses. 
Withholding 

tax 
capture 
revenues 
are 

the 
income 
taxes 
paid 
by 

businesses to the government 
on behalf of the businesses’ 
employees by taking a portion 
out of employees’ paychecks. 
If the business overestimates 
the amount of this income tax, 
employees are refunded every 
year when they file their taxes. 
Under the bills, the money 
withheld 
from 
employees’ 

checks would stay with the 
businesses rather than going to 
the state.

The program is capped at 

a maximum value of $250 
million, representing at most 
15 agreements with a company 
per year.

The 
five 
opposing 
votes 

in the Senate were all from 
Republicans. In an interview 
with the Detroit Free Press, one 
of them, Sen. Patrick Colbeck 
(R–Canton), argued the bills 
would benefit too few people.

“This is a case that we need 

to be pursuing broad-based 
tax 
incentives 
that 
benefit 

everybody, not these targeted 
benefits that benefit 15-some 
odd companies,” Colbeck said. 
“I’m tired of the business 
being prioritized over the best 
interests of everybody.”

In a statement last week, Gov. 

Rick Snyder was tentatively 

supportive of the bills.

“Both 
packages 
are 

addressing areas that need to 
be addressed,” he said. “There 
still may be some issues that 
can be improved, but I won’t 
want to get into too many 
specifics. And I think there’s 
a need for a tool in the tool 
box 
for 
potentially 
large 

manufacturers, 
particularly 

where they pay above average 
wages.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) strongly opposed 
the bill, states businesses in the 
state have already been given 
enough.

“The 
net 
amount 
that 

the state is taking in from 
businesses 
is 
miniscule 

compared 
to 
what 
people 

are paying in income tax and 
sales tax and all that,” he said. 
“We’ve given them a repeal of 
the Michigan Business Tax, a 
reform of the personal property 
tax, and we’ve given, given, 
given to businesses and I feel 
like the whole argument behind 
this is ridiculous. If businesses 
can’t create jobs after we’ve 
given them all this other stuff, 
then I don’t know what else it’s 
going to be.” 

Calling the bill “corporate 

welfare,” Rabhi argued the 
money the state would lose 
from the bill could be more 
effectively spent by the state 
itself.

“We have to be able to pay 

our bills as a state,” he said. 
“That’s 
$250 
million 
that 

could’ve gone to schools, that 
could’ve gone to police and fire, 
that could’ve gone to creating 
jobs in infrastructure. We can 
create jobs with that money 
if we actually invest it in our 
public infrastructure, which, 
that’s where the money’s going 
to be coming out of.” 

Rowan 
Conybeare, 
chair 

of College Democrats, Public 
Policy junior said she supports 
the bill if it follows through. 

“If the bill delivers on its 

promise 
of 
creating 
well-

paying jobs, then it should be 
an effective bipartisan effort,” 
Conybeare said. 

President 
of 
College 

Republicans Enrique Zalamea, 
an LSA junior, did not respond 
to requests for comment.

the Deir Yassin massacre, a 
1948 attack by Zionist military 
forces 
on 
the 
eponymous 

Palestinian village that left 
over 100 people dead in their 
homes.

Henry 
Herskovitz, 
a 

member of the board of 
directors 
for 
Deir 
Yassin 

Remembered 
and 
later, 
a 

self-described “former Jew,” 
stirred controversy in 2014 
when he campaigned for the 
release of Ernst Zundel from 
prison, who was sentenced by 
a German court to five years 
in prison for inciting racial 
hatred through literature he 
published. 

Zundel, 
along 
with 

co-author 
Eric 
Thompson, 

wrote a book entitled “The 
Hitler We Loved and Why,” 
published in 1977.

Though Herskovitz himself 

has not expressed such strong 
pro-Nazi sentiment, he does 
question the existence of the 
Holocaust. In a July 2016 
video posted on the Deir 
Yassin Remembered website, 
Herskovitz 
explained 
his 

doubts.

“Why do I support open 

debate on the Holocaust?” 
he asked. “Because I want to 

know what happened and why 
it happened. Because I resent 
manipulation, 
and 
I 
feel 

manipulated and threatened 
when decent people like Ernst 
... are locked up for expressing 
what they believe … If I say 
passenger jets did not bring 
down the two World Trade 
Centers, I don’t go to prison. 
But when I ask for a single 
wartime photo of a homicidal 
gas chamber, in Israel and a 
dozen other countries, I put 
myself at risk for prison time.”

A member of the Beth Israel 

congregation, who wished to 
remain anonymous for fear 
of harassment by Deir Yassin 
Remembered, said the group’s 
apparent concern with the 
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict 

and Israeli apartheid were 
superficial.

“That 
is 
the 
nominal 

organization to which they 
are affiliated, but that is 
ancillary to their primary 
motivation,” the member said. 
“Their primary motivation is 
a deep anti-Semitism, in the 
same way as the Ku Klux Klan 
claims to be defending white 
rights.”

Devin 
Jones, 
a 

representative 
of 
Students 

Allied 
for 
Freedom 
and 

Equality 
–– 
a 
student 

organization that opposes the 
Israeli apartheid, similarly 

to DYR -– agreed that DYR’s 
engagement with the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict was not 
serious.

“Firstly, 
I 
think 
that 

any group that denies that 
Holocaust participates in hate 
speech and contributes to anti-
Semitism by denying one of 
the worst genocides in human 
history,” Jones said. “Thus, if 
the SPLC found evidence that 
DYR has denied the Holocaust 
then their listing as a hate group 
is justified.”

Jones continued to say that 

DYR’s anti-Semitism did more 
to hurt the BDS movement than 
help it.

“Any type of racism, including 

anti-Semitism, is not allowed 
in the movement. It directly 
violates the principled approach 
that BDS takes to end Israeli 
state racism and apartheid,” 
he said. “Additionally, many 
Jews support BDS, including 
Jewish Voice for Peace, and any 
anti-Semitism and Holocaust 
denial that occurs by groups 
supporting BDS excludes Jews 
from being able to stand in 
solidarity 
with 
Palestinians 

and ending Israeli apartheid. 
Thus, DYR cannot fully support 
BDS until they renounce anti-
Semitism and holocaust denial.”

The synagogue has asked 

that people not engage with the 
picketers.

I

n November, I was one 
of 
over 
1,100 
seniors 

who signed a petition 

expressing 
disappointment 

with 
the 
spring 
2017 

commencement 
plans. 

Replacing a featured speaker 
with a video of past speeches 
seemed 
underwhelming 
— 

especially for the bicentennial 
event. Following the petition, 
seniors held out hope that a 
featured speaker would be 
announced and the issue would 
subside. After all, what good 
reason could the University 
of Michigan have to deny us 
something 
so 
standard? 
It 

doesn’t lack notable alumni 
to call up, nor does it struggle 
to bring interesting, relevant 
speakers to campus.

On Monday, I was surprised 

and upset to read that the 
University 
did 
not 
invite 

a featured speaker to our 
commencement and instead 
moved forward with a video 
production. I am proud to 
be a part of the University’s 
200-year history, and many of 
my memories here have been 
among the set of traditional 
Wolverine 
experiences. 

However, many more have 
been the result of my place as 
a student at this particular 
time, whether contributing to 
campus-wide Snapchat stories 
or marching in November’s 
post-election 
walk-outs. 
A 

video of current faculty and 
students 
reading 
decades- 

and 
centuries-old 
speeches 

will not capture these unique 

experiences and certainly will 
not honor them.

Rather, 
the 
video 

communicates to graduating 
seniors that our experiences, 
talents and futures are not 
worth addressing and that 
encouraging words from any 
commencement 
speech 
can 

just as easily apply to any 
of us. Collectively, perhaps 
this is true. Maybe we are 
not so different from classes 
before or after us, and maybe 
all commencement speakers 
speak in clichés that only 
momentarily inspire.

However, many graduates 

are non-traditional or first-
generation 
students, 
many 

have accrued thousands of 
dollars in debt and we have all 
encountered hardships over 
the past four years to make it 
to April 29, 2017, when it would 
be “worth it.” Our individual 
paths to graduation have not 
been as uniform as a video 
of recycled speeches would 
suggest, and we deserve even 
momentary inspiration from 
someone who understands us 
in the here and now.

What is most angering is that 

this is just another instance of 
a much more troublesome habit 
of University administrators: 
consistently 
ignoring 
or 

inadequately 
responding 

to 
student 
concerns 
and 

demands. For many of those 
cases, I can acknowledge — 
though I disagree with — the 
University’s stated perspective 
and 
hesitance 
to 
respond. 

There 
are 
more 
serious 

problems than dissatisfaction 
with a commencement speaker, 
or lack thereof, that require 
reflective, nuanced and long-
term 
responses 
from 
the 

University.

Thus, 
the 
University’s 

refusal to address the class 
of 
2017’s 
concerns 
about 

commencement 
renders 

me all the more shocked. 
Confronted 
with 
relatively 

uniform opposition to a non-
controversial University-only 
event, the University decided 
(again) to disregard student 
sentiment. A simple and clearly 
articulated problem with a 
tangible solution was ignored 
in the name of prioritizing 
the University’s history and 
reputation above its students. 
Rather than celebrating the 
graduates 
— 
the 
express 

purpose of a commencement 
ceremony — the University is 
hijacking our day in order to 
celebrate itself.

Admittedly, this may seem 

trivial in light of more serious 
issues affecting students and 
graduates, but it is nonetheless 
frustrating that the University 
ignored 
student 
concerns 

for no reason other than to 
promote 
itself. 
After 
four 

years of hard work here, it 
is disappointing to me and 
many other seniors that the 
University would not consider 
a simple student request.

The NIH, NEA and NEH 

have 
promoted 
crucial 

research in the sciences, as 
well as scholarship in arts, 
culture and history and have 
helped create thousands of 
jobs in all 435 congressional 
districts. On our campus, the 
proposed 20 percent budget 
cut to the NIH may have the 
most tangible effects, as the 
University prides itself as one 
of the world’s leading public 
research 
institutions. 
The 

NIH devotes over 80 percent 
of its resources to provide 
grants for research projects 
and programs in the sciences 
across 
the 
country. 
Many 

institutions of higher learning, 
including 
the 
University, 

depend on such grant money 
to pay for research costs, 
including graduate student and 
research assistant salaries and 
the equipment and materials 
necessary to conduct research. 
As a result of such a deep slash, 
all members of the University 
community — undergraduate 
and graduate students as well 
as staff and faculty — would be 
deprived of resources central 
to their abilities to conduct 
research. 
NIH 
funding 
for 

grants is already exceptionally 
competitive, and this cut will 
make research funding even 
less accessible.

Beyond 
the 
negative 

implications the cuts would 
have 
on 
the 
University’s 

scientific research, educational 
development 
and 
rankings, 

there is no mention of the 
National Science Foundation 
in the budget blueprint. The 
omission of the NSF, a similarly 

large federal funder of science 
research 
for 
universities, 
is 

another troubling sign for future 
research funding in Ann Arbor.

However, 
the 
natural 

sciences are not the only place 
where 
the 
University 
and 

the nation as a whole would 
feel 
the 
negative 
impacts 

of the budget. An outright 
elimination of the two agencies 
paramount to supporting the 
arts and humanities across 
the country, the NEA and 
NEH, would severely limit 
programs that promote the 
arts. With little public funding 
available elsewhere, programs 
at the University are largely 
dependent on grants from these 
endowments. 
For 
the 
2016 

season, the NEA awarded the 
University Musical Society with 
$30,000 to bring performers, 
residencies 
and 
educational 

programs 
to 
Ann 
Arbor. 

The 
money 
that 
University 

programs, 
like 
UMS, 
have 

received has been instrumental 
in jump-starting young peoples’ 
careers in the arts. 

Public 
media 
is 
also 
in 

jeopardy in the proposed budget. 
Funding for the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting, which 
largely funds local radio and TV 
stations, would be cut to zero. A 
2016 nationwide survey showed 
that PBS and other member 
organizations 
were 
among 

the most-trusted information 
sources in the country. In an 
era of increased distrust of 
government and news media, 
it is vital we preserve the 
organizations 
we 
trust 
the 

most to deliver us reliable and 
unbiased information. 

The national effect of placing 

such little value on the arts, 
humanities and research and 
so much on defense depicts the 
United States as a defensive 
and 
shortsighted 
nation. 

The NEA and NEH, which 
each received around $148 
million last year out of a $4 
trillion budget, have brought 
about 
lasting 
celebration 

and appreciation of the arts. 
Eliminating these agencies is 
a shameless ignorance of the 
invaluable 
output 
that 
has 

been generated from a merely 
fractional input. The NIH has 
been — and continues to be — a 
chief funder of research and the 
sciences. Slashing its funding 
by 20 percent is a surefire way 
to usher in a “lost generation” 
of scientific innovation and 
careers. Investments in these 
three programs have led to or 
supported thousands of jobs.

The 
argument 
that 
the 

proposed cuts are necessary 
in order to finance a massive 
defense 
department, 
one 

that already spends as much 
as the next seven countries 
combined, undermines many 
of the educational and cultural 
values upon which the United 
States has been built. It seems 
to demonstrate that our values 
lie more in the military than in 
the arts and sciences, despite 
the proven importance of the 
sciences and the arts. While 
the budget has yet to pass, 
these tangible repercussions, 
both monetarily and culturally, 
should 
be 
very 
concerning 

not only to members of the 
University community, but to 
the nation as a whole.

T

he day I was accepted 
to 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, I thought all 

my problems were 
solved. I had been 
admitted to a top 
public 
school 
and 

knew I would get an 
education that would 
help me to grow in 
a productive way. 
At first, I was not 
sure if I was going 
to get in, and I felt 
reassured 
reading 

my 
acceptance 

letter. I never thought of myself 
as the top of my class. I could 
never get by just by reading over 
the study guide, and I always had 
to work hard to do well. That is 
why when I was accepted to this 
elite university, and I was in awe 
and excited for the four years 
to come. I was excited to take 
advantage of the opportunities 
the University had to offer and 
was eager to jump right in.

But after being here for six 

months, I am surprised at the 
number of applications I still 
have to fill out, even after being 
accepted to and coming to the 
University. I recently applied 
to and was accepted to the 
Sweetland Minor in Writing, 
which was a program I did not 
expect to apply for. And I am 
continuing to struggle with the 
fact that I have to constantly 
demonstrate my commitment 
to my studies and activities 
because of the number of 
admissions processes looming 
after my initial acceptance.

I dreamed of college as a place 

where, once you are accepted, 
every educational opportunity is 
at your fingertips. When I came 
home for Winter Break to friends 
who attended other schools and 
had already declared their majors 
without applying, I was surprised 

to learn they were living my fantasy. 
I have noticed recently that friends 
my age become intimidated and 

question their interests 
as 
they 
hear 
about 

sophomores getting into 
different programs. I am 
constantly 
wondering 

if I am making the 
right decisions or if 
I am missing out on 
opportunities 
with 

applications that may 
come around once an 
academic career. When 
I see the congratulation 

posts on Facebook I can’t help but 
think, “I am interested in political 
science. Am I going to miss out if 
I don’t apply to the Ford School of 
Public Policy next year?”

I also question if I am applying 

to 
the 
right 
extracurriculars, 

because this campus offers clubs 
ranging from a capella to observing 
squirrels on campus. Am I missing 
out on opportunities by not 
spending time on going through 
rigorous application processes? 
And if I do apply, am I wasting my 
time trying when I know there is a 
slim chance of acceptance? Similar 
to academic programs, will I 
second guess myself after applying 

and realizing I have wasted my 
time and effort?

College is supposed to be a time 

to explore, but the culture created 
through competitive application 
processes 
disincentivizes 

exploration in favor of choosing 
one path and sticking with it. I’d 
love to spend my time exploring 
all my interests, but it poses a 
large challenge when I have to 
apply to and commit myself to 
few specific things.

Yes, it’s true that college 

isn’t easy and comes with lots 
of tough decisions. But these 
decisions 
should 
not 
limit 

exploration of our interests. 
College 
presents 
us 
with 

opportunities to grow, but if 
our explorations are limited 
by a yearly deadline, then how 
will we ever get the chance to 
explore our every interest?

I cannot deny the goals 

I have in transferring to an 
upper-level 
program 
have 

made me more invested in that 
program’s subject. But I worry 
that this has come at the cost of 
not pursuing other interests.

The constant need to evaluate 

my choices in what I have decided 
to dedicate myself to at such 
an early time in my career is 
exhausting. There is a time and 
a place in life to know that my 
professional decisions will have 
major consequences for my future, 
but that time and place is not in 
my freshman year. My freshman 
year should have been the time to 
explore all the opportunities that 
would feed my many interests. 
Instead, it was spent constantly 
looking over my shoulder making 
sure I was setting myself up for the 
best opportunities for success, and 
I shouldn’t have to feel this way.

FROM THE DAILY

Don’t cut our progress

E

arlier in March, President Donald Trump’s administration released its 
“skinny budget” proposal for the 2018 fiscal year, causing a lot of bipartisan 
controversy. To offset a 10 percent increase in defense spending, raising 

funds to $52.3 billion, the proposal would significantly reduce funding for the 
National Institutes of Health and eliminate federal funding for close to 20 agencies, 
including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. Cuts and closures of these programs will be detrimental, as 
they have had a profound and lasting impact in every corner of the United States. 
Extensive cuts in federal funding for — much less the elimination of — these 
agencies will have overwhelming ramifications for a wide array of educational 
opportunities at the University of Michigan. Though these proposals are not 
expected to be passed into law in their original forms, The Michigan Daily’s 
Editorial Board is deeply concerned by these proposed cuts because of their 
tangible effects on the University and how they reflect our country’s values.

I dreamed of 

college as a place 
where, once you 

are accepted, 

every educational 
opportunity is at 
your fingertips.


There are some things that 

don’t necessitate recipes. Some 
things are so simple that exact 
measurements or a lengthy 
ingredients list unnecessarily 
complicate their preparation. 
As simply as they’re made, 
they’re even more satisfyingly 
enjoyed. 
Oftentimes, 
these 

things take a form of their own 
— their preparation rooting 
itself into some tucked away 
part of our imaginations, where 
they grow and change over 
time.

These 
improvisations 
— 

the spontaneous melding of 
ingredients we unexpectedly 
find at hand — serve as the basis 
for many of our most treasured 
and 
frequently 
consumed 

meals.

The 
recipe-less 
recipe 

may have been derived from 
watching 
your 
mother 
or 

grandmother cook the same 
go-to meals time and time again 
or from attempting to recreate 
the soothing ease with which 
Food Network chefs display 

their creations on screen. Or, 
you snagged a vegetable or 
ingredient of the grocery store 
shelf and an idea popped into 
mind, finding its realization 
through swift, barely thought-
out 
movements 
within 
the 

kitchen, 
culminating 
in 
a 

thrown-together masterpiece. 
No 
matter 
its 
origin, 
the 

unscripted, haphazard kitchen 
creation dispels the pressure of 
having to meticulously follow 
instructions 
and 
compile 
a 

lengthy list of resources. Often, 
it’s this austerity that inhibits 
creativity and can result in a 
lackluster dish that doesn’t 
live up to expectations. Or, you 
may find yourself thoroughly 
impressed with the results 
only to remember the gruelling 
efforts leading up to it and 
swearing off the recipe for the 
future.

Equally 
as 
impressive 
is 

making something on the fly 
that tastes like it took a lot of 
effort and preparation, but 
didn’t actually. All it takes is 

a few ingredients you already 
have on hand and the marriage 
between a few pantry staples.

Marinated 
eggplant 
has 

recently become one of my 
go-to thrown-together recipes. 
It bears the ease of utilizing 
few 
ingredients 
and 
even 

less thought, yet it packs all 
the 
flavor 
and 
heartiness 

of 
extensive 
kitchen 
work. 

The 
dish 
emerged 
after 
I 

bought eggplant on a whim 
and, unable to decide the 

fate of its consumption, was 
struck 
by 
inspiration 
from 

the transcendent memory of 
a marinated eggplant dish I 
had once been served at Mani 
Osteria. So, to the best of my 
ability, I attempted to recreate 

the flavorful dish with only 
the items at hand — eggplant, 
salt and pepper, chili flakes, 
olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and 
garlic.

As is my preferred cooking 

method with most vegetables, 
I hastily cut my eggplant into 
cubes, tossed them in olive oil 
and sprinkled them with salt, 
before throwing them in the 
oven at 375º for about 20-30 
minutes, checking frequently 
to ensure all sides got their fair 
share of roasting. Typically, 
I’d sprinkle the eggplant with 
salt and let rest for ten minutes 
prior to soaking up the excess 
moisture with paper towels, 
however I was out of paper 
towels — a repercussion to be 
expected when cooking on the 
fly (and when living with 13 
roommates in college).

After the the eggplant turned 

nice and crisp in the oven, 
almost charred on some sides, 
while perfectly tender on the 
other, I let it cool for several 
minutes. Then, I grabbed a 

tupperware 
container 
and 

tossed 
the 
cooled 
eggplant 

cubes 
in; 
I 
drizzled 
them 

generously with more olive 
oil, balsamic vinegar and the 
crushed garlic and added a 
generous pinch of salt, black 
pepper and red chili flakes 
(and about half a teaspoon of 
dried basil if you have it on 
hand), tossing well to combine. 
In order to draw out all those 
piquant 
flavors, 
I 
let 
the 

eggplant mixture refrigerate 
for a few hours to soak up the 
acidity of the vinegar and the 
sweet bite of garlic — the nutty 
olive oil binding all the rich, 
zesty flavors together.

It’s no surprise then, that 

waiting 
for 
the 
eggplant 

to marinate can be trying. 
However, once the chunks of 
eggplant have absorbed the 
marinade, they can be served 
with a thick, crusty bread that’s 
been toasted to a slightly burnt 
crisp, or they can be tossed with 
freshly sliced basil leaves and 
shaved parmesan into a salad — 

or if you’re me — eaten straight 
out of the container.

Not only is it incredibly easy to 

make, a large batch of marinated 
eggplant can carry you through 
the week. The meaty eggplant, 
enhanced by the flavors of the 
marinade, make a superb side dish 
or meal of their own. Dole out over 
pasta with plenty of cheese and 
fresh basil for a quick weeknight 
meal or over a bowl of grains and 
sautéed kale.

It’s flavors are vibrant and crisp 

enough to cool our palates on a 
summer day, while the hearty 
vegetable can satisfy on a cold, 
winter evening. If you’re not an 
eggplant-kind-of-person (it’s cool, 
not everyone is), this method works 
great with red bell peppers too. Easy 
and versatile? You heckin’ bet it is. 
Delicious? That too.

With slightly more effort than 

pouring yourself a bowl of cereal, 
marinated eggplant be an easy fix 
to an uninspired meal, without 
draining your energy or stock of 
ingredients. So, roast and refrigerate 
those tasty little cubes and enjoy.

‘Life’ is well-crafted but 
ultimately meaningless 

COURTESY OF HOTEL DALLAS

Astronauts 

find an alien. The 
astronauts 
are 

idiots. 
The 
alien 

kills the astronauts. 
With 
a 
premise 

like that, it’s hard 
to 
see 
“Life” 
as 

much more than a modern-
day, A-list “Alien” rip-off, but 
it surprisingly has more in 
common with “Gravity” than 
anything else. Aesthetically, 
the 
comparisons 
write 

themselves from the first shot 
— a “oner” that encompasses 
the 
entire 
first 
opening 

scene. While it lacks the scale 
and emotion of that earlier 
film, “Life” is nonetheless 
impressive in how handily it 
manages its tension and horror. 
The resultant film is flawed, 
but perhaps the most intense 
space thriller since Alfonso 
Cuarón’s 2013 masterpiece.

Apart 
from 
being 

just 
a 
gorgeous 
piece 
of 

cinematography and direction, 
the opening scene shows off 
the setting, the key to the 
film’s successes. The emphasis 
placed on space as we know it as 
opposed to a futuristic starship 
a la “Alien” gives the film an 
immediately scary atmosphere 
that director Daniel Espinosa 
(“Child 44”) wrings for nearly 
every drop of tension. To that 
end, “Life” never goes for the 
easy scare, instead preferring 
to ease the viewer into full-on 
terror and let the characters’ 
increasing paranoia speak for 
itself. Much of the film is made 
up of several slow-burn scenes 
followed by bursts of horror, 
and 
screenwriters 
Rhett 

Reese 
and 
Paul 
Wernick’s 

(“Deadpool”) fearlessness with 
character deaths, established 
early, makes each subsequent 

scare better than the last.

It’s impossible to go too deep 

into “Life” without discussing 
the alien at the center of it in 

some capacity. 
Without going 
into excessive 
detail, 
while 

the design of 
the 
creature 

will likely fall 
into 
“love 
it 

or hate it” territory, Espinosa 
does great work here, as well. 
From the moment its intentions 
become malicious in a sequence 
that 
is 
equal 
parts 
well-

directed and frightening, the 
alien is a singularly terrifying 
antagonist. It’s a force of pure 
evil that constantly outwits 

and outplays the scientists, 
who — in a departure from 
genre clichés — don’t act like 
complete idiots for the entirety 
of the runtime. The action 
therefore becomes that much 

more engaging.

This is not to say that the 

characters 
on 
display 
are 

paragons of complexity or 
anything of the sort. They’re 
well-sketched more than well-
written, not quite flat but 
not quite fully formed either. 
This doesn’t affect the movie 
too much, as there are some 
character traits to latch onto, 
but it does hold it back to an 
extent. Films like “Alien” and 
“Gravity” succeeded because 
of the combination of suspense 
and character. It would have 
been hard to give much depth 
to a cast of this size and caliber 
without interrupting the film’s 
pacing, but it may have also 
given “Life” the push it needed 
to move from “good” to “great.”

And on that note, the aspect 

that makes “Life” hardest to 
recommend despite its flashes 
of greatness is impossible to 
describe at all: the ending. 
Again, without going into any 
detail, the ending to “Life” is 
an unrewarding fake-out that 
relies on poor editing to get its 
point across. It’s foreshadowed 
from a mile away, but sitting 
in the theater, after two hours 
of sustained tension, it’s hard 
to believe that it was greenlit. 
It gives the entire film a 
meaningless cast in retrospect.

The ending doesn’t taint 

the entirety of “Life,” though. 
It is still well-crafted, and 
Espinosa’s handling of both 
character and mood is assured. 
Moviegoers looking for a good 
scare should look no further. 
It isn’t without its problems, 
and they keep the film from 
attaining 
the 
greatness 
it 

comes so close to, but “Life” 
is still an involving — if 
ultimately 
empty-feeling 
— 

time at the movies.

Making eggplant effortless

Mandolinist Daniel Brito 
to perform in Kerrytown

COMPLICITE

For perhaps as long as human 

society has existed, music has 
existed with it. As civilizations and 
empires rose and fell, as republics 
and autocracies collapsed and 
were reborn, music was there 
through it all. It’s one of the few 
true universals in our world, one 
of the omnipresent markers of our 
existence that cling at the very core 
of what it is to be human. It was 
present in the nomads’ tent, and 
it’s present on the phone in your 
pocket. Because of this, to come 
anywhere even remotely near 
to an understanding of a culture 
requires a knowledge of the music 
that is important to it. It helps to 
show the passions and the rituals 
of a people, the history and ethos of 
a society. And fortunately, today’s 
globalized world affords us more 
opportunities than ever to hear 
and admire those musics from 
traditions unfamiliar to our ears.

One such unfamiliar tradition 

(for most Ann Arborites, at least) 
is the choro music of Brazil. 
Originating about 150 years ago in 
Rio de Janeiro, choro marks one of 
the first fundamentally Brazilian 
genres of instrumental music, 
and in a concert Saturday night at 
Kerrytown Concert House, the 
audience will have the chance to 
experience a performance by one of 
this genre’s greatest contemporary 
musicians.

“Choro 
has 
its 
origin 
in 

European polka. It arrived in Brazil 
fast and dancing, and Brazilian 
musicians started to play it slowly 
and it became more melancholic, 
more dramatic,” said Danilo Brito, 
mandolinist and choro musician, 
who will be performing this 
Saturday in Kerrytown. “This was 
around 1860, 1870. So soon we were 
doing music to make people cry, 
because it caused this emotion to 
those who were hearing it, and 
so the name of this genre, choro, 
means ‘to cry.’ ”

Brito (who does not speak 

English, 
and 
communicated 

through 
translation 
by 
his 

manager, Maria Silvia Braga) 
went on to explain that despite the 

genre’s name, much of the music is 
in fact fast, cheerful and virtuosic 
— “but always intense.”

Choro is a type of music that is 

of great important to the culture of 
Brazil, expressing a wide range of 
sentiments, and in the view of Brito 
and others, it is the genre that best 
represents the spirit of the nation.

“Choro is the musical expression 

of 
Brazilian 
people,” 
Brito 

explained. “Brazilian people have 
very intense feelings, sometimes 
melancholic, sometimes nostalgic, 
sometimes cheerful. All these 
different 
intense 
feelings 
of 

Brazilian people are very well 
represented by all the different 

styles that choro has.”

In this assessment, Brito is in 

the company of some of the most 
famous Brazilian figures in the 
history of music.

“The Brazilian composer Heitor 

Villa-Lobos said that choro is the 
music that best represents the soul 
of Brazilian people,” Brito said. 
“The great maestro and composer 
Radamés Gnattali said that choro 
is the most perfect and last stage of 
Brazilian music.”

Brito was drawn to choro at 

a young age. His father was an 
amature musician, and played 
mandolin 
and 
Cavaquinho. 

Through him and the musical 
environment he fostered around 
him, Brito was introduced to music 
early on.

“[Some] nights [we] had hearings 

of old vinyl recordings, and very 
soon [I] started playing [my] 
father’s 
instruments, 
mandolin 

and cavaquinho,” Brito said. “And 
through hearing the old vinyls [I] 
learned to play.”

Brito never had a formal teacher, 

but his natural ability and passion 
for the music has since propelled 
him to the forefront of the choro 

scene. Saturday’s performance will 
mark but one concert on a tour that 
has already included Vancouver, 
Seattle, Portland and Oakland, 
among others. The tour has been 
an immensely positive experience 
for him.

“It’s been wonderful, my feelings 

about this, my impressions of these 
concerts have been wonderful,” 
Brito said. “ [There has been] a very 
warm reception by the audience, 
always with full houses, and a great 
energy… [I] played at Kuumbwa 
[Jazz] in Santa Cruz last night, and 
it was a memorable evening that 
[I] will keep with [me] the rest of 
[my] life. The connection with the 
audience was fantastic.”

Choro is a music that is energetic, 

involving a full range of complex 
harmonies 
and 
counterpoint, 

in addition to having a highly 
improvisatory structure. These 
qualities, in part, help address the 
question of why Brito is so drawn 
to the particular genre.

More than anything, however, 

it was the passionate spirit of the 
music that drew him in.

“This music captured me by 

feeling,” Brito said. “It’s always 
a very intense and strong feeling 
when you hear it. Either it is 
cheerful, 
or 
melancholic, 
or 

chromatic, or romantic. It’s a genre 
that gives [one] the tools to express 
[one’s] feelings in a most complete 
way, perfectly or almost perfect.”

It is this sense of emotion and 

feeling that Brito hopes to share 
with Ann Arbor Saturday night. 
When he performs, it is an act of 
passion, a passing on of the emotion 
of the music.

“The music that [I] will present 

comes directly from [my] heart,” 
Brito said. “The style of music that 
we play demands a lot of study 
and technicality, but the intention 
is that the audience does not feel 
all this work that is behind, but 
just receives music as it is, as pure 
emotion, feelings and expressions. 
Our technique is always from the 
work of music of pure heart. The 
audience, hearing it, will feel this.”

This 
week 

marked 
the 
24th 

season 
of 
ABC’s 

long-standing, 
live 
competition 

show 
“Dancing 

with 
the 
Stars.” 

Coincidentally, 
this 
also 
marks 

the 400th episode 
for the series, for 
which the network has spared 
no expense in celebration of 
its accomplishments. Opening 
with 
a 
number 
aimed 
at 

replicating the Oscar-winning 
film “La La Land,” the cast 
waltzed onto the stage for 
their first dance of the season. 

Perhaps the most notable 

celebrity cast member this 
season is Normani Kordei, 
one of the members of girl 
band Fifth Harmony, which 
has received recent backlash 
after 
member 
Camila 

Cabello’s sudden departure. 
However, Normani is quick 
to distance herself from her 
singing 
career, 
announcing 

from the beginning that her 
grandmother’s love of the show 
is what ultimately compelled 
her to join the cast. True to her 
fierce personality as a member 
of Fifth Harmony, Normani 
leaves it all on the dance floor.

On the other side of the 

spectrum, 
“Saturday 
Night 

Live” 
alum 
Chris 
Kattan, 

with partner Witney Carson, 

embrace 
the 
comedian’s 

personality to perfection in 
their dance — so much so that 
the pair’s score for the night 

pulls them to 
the 
bottom 

of the ranks 
this 
season. 

Was their jazz 
number 
truly 

horrendous? 
Not 
necessarily, 
just 
pulled 

off in a novel 
approach that 

didn’t sit well with the judges. 
These discrepancies between 
the elements of a celebrity’s 
background and character that 
ultimately win over the judges 
and determines whether or 
not they will advance in the 
competition begs the question 
of 
subjectivity. 
While 
one 

couple’s tango is beautifully 
executed in terms of style 
and precision in step, another 
couple’s quickstep may suffer 
from too much of the celebrity’s 
personality 
interjected 
into 

their dance.

While some groups may 

choose to dress in the manner 
of their professions, others 
draw from their experiences. 
All in all, this trend seems 
to 
indicate 
that 
numbers 

choreographed in a manner 
least connected to the dancers 
seem to work the best on 
“DWTS.”

Another 
example 
of 

this is the performance of 
professional bull rider Bonner 
Bolton and dancing companion 

Sharna Burgess. Though they 
performed 
their 
country 

cha cha with unmistakable 
chemistry and a hint of sass, 
their overall score kept them 
situated nicely in the middle 
of the competition. One of 
the main influences of their 
performance 
came 
from 

Bolton’s bull riding days, as the 
couple struts the stage with 
blue jeans and plaid shirts, 
cha cha-ing the stage with a 
southern strut and bedazzling 
the 
crowd. 
Alternatively, 

Simone Biles, a gold medal 
Olympic 
gymnast, 
stunned 

with a beautiful dance. Biles 
is 
clearly 
the 
frontrunner 

of the competition, if she 
can 
continue 
producing 

equally exquisite moves in 
future 
performances. 
What 

differentiates these two pairs, 
once again, seems to be their 
ability to incorporate style 
and the way in which strong 
elements of their personalities 
leak into their performances.

This season of “Dancing 

with the Stars” is clearly off 
to an interesting start, as 
the dancing duos attempt to 
balance out their interests 
and bring the best aspects of 
the personalities into their 
performances. Though some 
performers may learn from 
their mistakes, others grapple 
with the idea of letting go of 
personality quirks in favor of 
higher scores. All points aside, 
the 400th episode is a true 
reflection of what “Dancing 
with the Stars” is all about.

LIONSGATE

Based 
on 
the 

perennially 
successful “Mighty 
Morphin’ 
Power 

Rangers” 
series 

that 
has 
been 

airing on TV in 
various 
iterations 

since the early ’90s, this new 
film attempts to update the 
costumed-samurai-who-ride-
robot-dinosaurs premise for a 
modern audience — to varying 
levels of success.

Directed by Dean Israelite 

(“Project Almanac”), “Power 
Rangers” 
follows 
in 
that 

series’ footsteps by choosing 
to focus mostly on the five 
titular heroes rather then the 
wacky world around them. 
These 
aren’t 
the 
happy-

go-lucky Power Rangers of 
yesteryear; these teenagers are 
troubled, and the film makes 
sure that the audience knows 
it. A cast of talented, more-
or-less unknowns makes up 
the ranks of these new edgier 
Rangers, 
including 
Dacre 

Montgomery (“A Few Less 
Men”), Naomi Scott (“Terra 
Nova”), RJ Cyler (“Me and Earl 
and the Dying Girl), Becky 
G (“House of Sin”), and Ludi 
Lin (“Monster Hunt”) who are 
joined by veteran actors Bryan 
Cranston 
(“Breaking 
Bad”), 

Bill Hader (“Saturday Night 
Live”), and Elizabeth Banks 
(“Pitch Perfect”) as the more 

ridiculous sci-fi characters.

Although it opens with a 

wacky sci-fi prelude in which 
Cranston’s Zordon becomes the 

last remaining 
original Power 
Ranger, 
the 

vast 
majority 

of the film’s 
runtime 
is 

spent focusing 
on the various 
familial 
and 

social 
problems 
that 
the 

teenagers are dealing with 
rather then the extraterrestrial 
threat of Banks’s Rita Repulsa. 
One of our heroes is a burnt-out 
star quarterback, one of them is 
caring for an ailing parent, one 
of them has autism, one was 
involved in a sexting scandal 
and one of them doesn’t believe 
her parents will accept her for 
who she really is. All of them 
are social outcasts; it’s teen 
drama to the 10th degree.

In 
the 
name 
of 
being 

realistic, 
“Power 
Rangers” 

ends up turning into an episode 
of “Degrassi” for long stretches 
of its runtime. Everything is 
played so seriously that when 
it is finally time for someone to 
shout “Go, go, power rangers!” 
and giant robot dinosaurs run 
across the screen, it’s hard not 
to completely laugh out loud. 
Tonal whiplash abounds, and 
yet somehow, against all odds, 
parts of it do kind of work.

Make no mistake, “Power 

Rangers” is stupid. Not stupid 
in the mindless destruction 
sense of “Man of Steel” or “The 
Avengers” or any other number 

of 
other 
recent 
superhero 

flicks, but stupid in that it 
combines a lot of different 
dumb stuff together. It’s got 
that dumb teenage melodrama. 
It’s got that dumb big action 
scene at the end. It’s got a 
pretty fun villain with a pretty 
dumb plan. But as dumb as it 
all is, the actors know it, the 
writer knows it, the studio 
clearly knew it and the director 
seems to have given but one 
direction to his cast: ham it up. 
The movie goes all in on every 
dumb thing about it.

But it’s hard not to respect 

that in a day and age in which 
every movie is trying to be 
the most important or the 
biggest movie of the year. This 
movie knows what it is. It’s a 
B-movie for kids. And kids will 
undoubtedly love it. It’s not 
trying to reinvent the wheel 
from a narrative perspective, 
but it does bring some much 
needed diversity to the Power 
Rangers ranks in a way that is 
more understated and natural 
then similar attempts by other 
movies (the recent “Beauty 
and the Beast” comes to mind). 
Everyone (especially the older 
actors) is clearly having a 
ball, and the last third of the 
film revels in being about 
exactly one thing: the power 
of 
friendship. 
Yes, 
“Power 

Rangers” is a silly, dumb kids 
movie. But it never tries to be 
anything but that. In this day 
and age, that’s oddly quaint.

‘Power Rangers’ surprises

FILM REVIEW
‘CHiPS’ exhausts, dismays

“CHiPs” opens with the 

onscreen 
message: 
“The 

California 
Highway 
Patrol 

does not endorse 
this film. At all.” At 
first, it seems like 
a 
tongue-in-cheek 

joke about police 
officers not wanting 
a movie to make 
light of their jobs. 
Then 
the 
movie 

starts. Walking out 
of the theater, it is 
clear that the disclaimer was a 
warning, an omen not heeded. 
No one in their right mind 
would want to be associated 
with a comedy this tepid and 
devoid of laughs, least of all the 
people it allegedly portrays. 
It’s a crime-comedy with a 
boring crime and next-to-no 
comedy, annoying at best and 
offensive at worst.

It 
starts 
out 
harmlessly 

enough, 
with 
early 
scenes 

wisely leaning more heavily 
on Michael Peña (“Collateral 
Beauty”), by far the funnier of 
the two leads — about three 
of the four jokes in the entire 
movie that work do so because 
of him. Then, the story shifts 
into gear, and it becomes clear 
what type of comedy “CHiPs” 
will be. It’s the kind where 
there aren’t really any jokes, 
the writers just force in lengthy 
conversations 
about 
things 

that aren’t innately funny in 
the hope that, at some point, 
God will smile upon them and 
comedy will present itself.

So viewers are left with 

conversations on such wide-

ranging, fascinating topics as 
poop and “scrotal tears” that 
feel like they go on for a small 
eternity. These things can 
be funny if something funny 
is being said, but when, say, 
charmless characters are just 

talking 
about 

anilingus over 
and over again, 
that tends to be 
more annoying 
than anything 
else.

Perhaps 
if 

the characters 
were charming 
or 
likable, 

it would be easier to give 
“CHiPs” a pass, but instead, 
the characters seem to fall into 
a handful of easily divisible 
categories. 
The 
women 
— 

except for director, writer 
and star Dax Shepard’s (“The 
Boss”) 
wife, 
Kristen 
Bell 

(“Bad Moms”) — exist to be 
sexualized or made fun of for 
their lack of attractiveness in 
a series of gags about being 
a “two out of ten” that, if 
nothing else, will probably 
give our sitting president a 
hearty laugh. The men of the 
movie exist either to be macho, 
macho men or to be made fun 
of for not being enough of a 
macho, macho man.

The latter group seems to 

speak to a deeper misogyny 
or just plain bigotry at the 
heart of “CHiPs.” As director, 
Shepard has no problem with 
putting bare breasts on screen 
whenever possible, but when 
the time comes for him to get 
naked — in a role that he wrote 
and cast himself in no less — 
nudity is suddenly a bridge too 
far, and he opts to blur it out 

in one of the most hypocritical 
creative decisions in recent 
memory. If it were possible to 
chalk it up to anything other 
than Shepard’s cowardice, it 
might be the funniest moment 
in the movie. As it is, it’s still 
so brazenly out of place and 
nonsensical that it’s worth an 
incredulous “Did that really 
just happen?” smile.

With the dearth of any 

source 
of 
amusement 
on 

display, the desperate mind 
of an average “CHiPs” viewer 
will begin to look elsewhere 
for entertainment. They will 
find none. As with seemingly 
all 
modern 
comedies, 
the 

movie takes a sudden turn 
into 
self-seriousness 
in 
a 

sequence that is bereft of 
laughter — intentionally this 
time. Similarly dour is Vincent 
D’Onofrio, who isn’t bad, but 
his villain — with his sudden 
bursts of violent anger and 
forced backstory for the sake 
of “sympathy” — feels like 
a poor man’s version of his 
much better turn on “Marvel’s 
Daredevil.”

With 
its 
tone, 
“CHiPs” 

is clearly trying to emulate 
the wild success and critical 
acclaim of “21 Jump Street,” 
but where the writers should 
have 
learned 
to 
balance 

satirizing the action-comedy 
genre while paying tribute to 
their source material, they 
instead learned to cram in 
as many F-bombs as possible 
and go for the easy poop joke 
whenever they can. The result 
may include a couple decent 
bike chases but is otherwise 
tiringly awkward and unfunny 
to the point of mental agony.

2017 Position-by-position breakdown

The No. 22 Michigan baseball 

team’s lineup was not yet set 
in stone when it traveled to 
California for a 13-game road trip 
over spring break. After losing 
former pitcher Brett Adcock, first 
baseman Carmen Benedetti and 
pitcher Evan Hill to the MLB, 
there seemed to be multiple 
voids the Wolverines would have 
trouble filling.

What 
Michigan 
did 
not 

know, 
though, 
was 
that 
it 

would fill those positions with 
incredible ease, recording 238 
hits, 165 runs and a .387 on-base 
percentage so far this season. 
Just as the Wolverines have had a 
consistently high-octane offense, 
their defense has had ice in its 
veins.

Posting a 19-6 record with 

a cumulative 3.16 earned-run 
average and seven saves, the 
Michigan pitching rotation has 
outperformed 
expectations. 

Backing the pitchers up is a 
veteran fielding squad that has 
given up just 18 errors so far this 
year.

The 
Daily 
breaks 
down 

the 
Wolverines 
position-by-

position in order to anticipate 
the solidifying starting lineup 
approaching 
Michigan’s 
long 

home stand, starting with a three-
game matchup against Penn State 
this weekend.

Pitching:
With two of four starting 

pitchers 
returning 
from 
last 

year’s squad, the battle for the ace 
job ensued immediately from the 
start of spring training. Despite 
the 
competition, 
it 
seemed 

inevitable that junior left-hander 
Oliver Jaskie would fill that role.

With a 3-1 record and 3.44 

ERA, Jaskie boasts the best 
performances 
and 
the 
most 

innings pitched out of the starting 
rotation with 34. However, he 
has not quite achieved superstar 
status due to the prowess and 
consistency of his teammates.

Junior 
right-hander 
Alec 

Rennard, who transferred this 
year from Santa Rosa Junior 
College, has certainly stepped up 
to the challenge, recording a 3.20 
ERA with four wins and one loss. 
Rennard has quickly solidified 
his role in the rotation as a spot 
starter, and the fact that he has 
walked just two batters over the 
course of his 25.1 innings pitched 
displays his consistency.

Junior 
left-hander 
Michael 

Hendrickson stands as the lone 
pitcher without a loss. With a 
3.25 ERA — but 13 walks and 11 
runs forfeited — Hendrickson 
has proven to be a reliable arm 
and will continue to get the nod. 
Junior right-hander Ryan Nutof, 
on the other hand, lags behind 
the rest of the rotation with a 
6.39 ERA and a 1-1 record. While 
Nutof has a discrepancy in the 
ERA column, his 14 walks over 31 
innings pitched is on par with the 
rest of the rotation.

Michigan has not found its 

go-to relievers as of yet. Senior 
right-hander Jackson Lamb leads 
the team with six saves and has 
been entering the game in the 
most save situations.

However, it is unclear who 

will come into the game in the 
sixth, seventh or eighth innings. 
Sophomore William Tribucher 
has pitched the most innings from 

a reliever with 19 and has a 2.37 
ERA, while freshman Tommy 
Henry has 16.2 innings pitched 
with a 1.08 ERA. Both seem to be 
the frontrunners for a mid-game 
clutch substitute, but have been 
used interchangeably.

As 
the 
Wolverines 
are 

in the midst of an 18-game 
home stretch, kicked off by a 
matchup against Penn State this 
weekend, Michigan will need 
to mix-and-match pitchers in 
order to maintain its consistent 
performances.

Catchers:
One thing is clear about the 

catcher position, and it’s that 
senior Harrison Wenson will be 
behind the plate. His lackluster 
.224 batting average thus far is 
not indicative of his impact on 
the field. With 20 RBI — third on 
the team — he certainly makes 
his presence known on and off 
the field. Though Wenson was 
drafted 39th in last year’s MLB 
Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
he decided to stay at Michigan, 
a decision that speaks to his 
passion for the team as well as 
his leadership. Right now, junior 
third baseman Drew Lugbauer 
starts behind the plate when 
Wenson can’t. However, that 
deal is not permanent, as two 
freshmen recruits in Harrison 
Salter 
and 
Marcus 
Chavez 

joined the squad. Junior Brock 
Keener seems poised to assume 
the position in the future, as he 
already has been filling in for 
Wenson in certain situations.

First Base:
Junior Jake Bivens has taken 

up the mantle at first base and 
seems to have a solid footing for 
the position. With a .258 batting 

average — right in the middle 
of the pack — and a .421 on-base 
percentage, Bivens established 
himself as a reliable bat that can 
hit in any spot in the lineup. His 
recent move to sixth in the batting 
order shows his versatility as a 
hitter.

What’s 
more 
impressive, 

though, is his glove. He’s been 
involved in 203 put outs, and has 
only committed one error. Bivens’ 
offensive output and defensive 
prowess makes him a pivotal part 
of the lineup.

Second Base:
The first batter that steps 

up to the plate at Ray Fisher 
Stadium is 5’8” sophomore Ako 
Thomas. Though atypical for a 
leadoff hitter, Thomas boasts a 
.323 batting average with 31 hits 
and a .450 on-base percentage. 
Thomas has proven that his lead-

off abilities demand respect, and 
his one error shows his reliability 
in the field.

Shortstop:
Ranked third in the Big Ten in 

hits with 34, currently leading the 
team in batting average at .330 
and in the midst of an 11-game 
hitting streak, Michael Brdar 
exemplifies what it means to be a 
senior on a baseball team. His two 
errors are not too shabby either, 
making him a player that can be 
counted on to produce offensively 
while making very few mistakes 
in the field.

Third Base:
In 
the 
third 
game 
of 

Michigan’s 
series 
against 

Northern Illinois earlier this 
season, Lugbauer stepped up 
to the plate and said goodbye 
to the Huskies with a walk-off 
three-run home run beyond the 

right field wall. Lugbauer leads 
the team in home runs and RBI 
with six and 27, respectively. 
The clean-up hitter has been a 
machine at the plate and he will 
likely continue to be a staple for 
the Wolverine offense.

Outfield:
Much like the infield, the 

outfield 
exemplifies 
offensive 

performance supplemented by 
solid defense. In right field is 
sophomore Jonathan Engelmann, 
who trails his fellow outfielders 
with a batting average at .246. In 
center field is Johnny Slater, who 
leads the team with four triples 
and also boasts 22 RBI. In left 
field is redshirt sophomore Miles 
Lewis, who leads the outfield in 
batting average at .302. Lewis, 
since transferring this season, has 
provided the Michigan offense 
with yet another reliable bat.

Big Ten Breakdown: Michigan set to challenge for title

Last year, the Michigan baseball 

team had an impressive start to the 
season and was pegged to finish 
high in the Big Ten. But by the 
end of the 2015-16 campaign, the 
Wolverines hopes of the postseason 
quickly vanished after dropping 
nine of their last 11 games. 

This year, Michigan has had 

much of the same start to its season 
as last year. Now, it is eager to erase 
the sting of barely missing out on the 
NCAA Tournament and has made a 
point to rest key players when the 
opportunity arises. But with the 
Wolverines entering the heart of 
the Big Ten season, they will need 
to focus on staying consistent all 
season.

In the preseason coach’s poll, 

Maryland was selected to finish 
atop the Big Ten with Michigan 
following right behind – a matchup 
fans didn’t have to wait long to see.

The Wolverines opened Big 

Ten play against the Terrapins last 
weekend, wrecking a sweep for 
Maryland by taking Sunday’s game 
in College Park. 

Despite Michigan’s impressive 

season thus far, coach Erik Bakich 
doesn’t 
care 
about 
preseason 

rankings 
or 
even 
in-season 

rankings. All that matters to him is 
the result at the end of the year.

For those who want a glimpse 

at what the end of the season could 
hold, the Daily breaks down the 
teams that will compete against the 
Wolverines for the Big Ten title.

Michigan State (3-0 Big Ten, 

15-6 overall)

Fresh off one of its best seasons 

in program history, Michigan State 
improved one spot from last year’s 
preseason poll, moving into the 
fifth slot. The Spartans shine the 
brightest on offense, leading the Big 
Ten in team batting average with 
.303 and hits with 233. Michigan 
State currently has nine batters 
batting over .300, with its most 
consistent threat being sophomore 
infielder Marty Bechina. Bechina 
is batting .338 and has started every 
game this season.

The Spartans nearly lost four 

players to the MLB draft, but senior 
catcher Matt Byars decided to 
remain in East Lansing and finish 
his college career. Byars appeared in 
all but one game for Michigan State 
last year and finished the season 
batting .284 with 26 RBI — a feat he 
is well on his way to achieving again 
this year with a .254 batting average 
and 11 RBI.

The Spartans ended their season 

in the semifinals of the Big Ten 

Tournament against Ohio State in 
extra innings, a loss it is sure to try 
and redeem this year.

Indiana (3-0, 14-9-1)
The 
Hoosiers 
are 
sitting 

comfortably in the middle of the 
pack in the Big Ten. They were 
picked to finish fourth in the 
conference, and their season is 
shaping up to follow suit.

While 
Indiana 
is 
strong 

offensively, its pitching may cost 
it some games down the stretch. 
Its regular starters on the mound 
include junior right-hander Brian 
Hobbie, sophomore left-hander Tim 
Herrin and freshman left-hander 
Andrew Saalfrank, each with a 4.50, 
4.97 and 6.08 ERA, respectively.

The Hoosiers’ pitching staff 

allows a lot of hits and cannot 
counteract 
that 
with 
many 

strikeouts. The trio of starters has 
just 53 strikeouts on the year. For 
comparison, Jaskie alone has 42.

Fortunately 
for 
Indiana, 
it 

returned its offensive most valuable 
player in Craig Dedelow, who 
decided to stay with the Hoosiers 
even after being drafted in the 34th 
round.

Indiana will host the Big Ten 

Tournament at the end of the 
season, but if it cannot strengthen 
itself on the bump, the Hoosiers 
may be looking at a worse finish 

than fourth place.

Maryland (2-1, 15-8)
Picked to finish first in the Big 

Ten and taking two out of three 
games against Michigan was a 
promising start to the Terrapins’ 
conference campaign.

Junior 
right-hander 
Brian 

Shaffer currently has the most 
impressive statistics in the Big Ten. 
He leads the conference with a 
1.77 ERA and has 48 strikeouts on 
the year. His teammate, freshman 
right-hander Tyler Blohm, also 
joins him near the top of the Big 
Ten, currently boasting a 2.86 ERA.

The pair has already received 

Big Ten honors, with Shaffer taking 
home Pitcher of the Week and 
Blohm sharing the Co-Freshman of 
the Week two weeks in a row.

Shaffer was dominant against 

the Wolverines, pitching 8.0 innings 
and allowing just five hits and two 
runs.

Two players were added to the 

Preseason Honors list, including 
sophomore outfielder Marty Costes. 
He leads the Terrapins with a .359 
batting average, 33 hits and 15 RBI. 
Costes has only improved since 
his 2015-16 campaign in which he 
batted .263 and led his team with 
37 RBI. As a sophomore, he still has 
plenty of time to make his mark for 
Maryland.

Minnesota (3-0, 15-8)
Minnesota boasts the best two 

hitters in the conference in redshirt 
freshman infielder Jordan Kozicky 
and junior infielder Luke Petterson, 
hitting .400 and .397, respectively, 
and the rest of the Golden Gophers’ 
lineup isn’t far behind.

Minnesota currently sits second 

in the Big Ten after a sweep of 
Northwestern, and if the Golden 
Gophers can use the momentum 
from the top of their batting order to 
propel the offense, they may be able 
to remain in the upper-half of the 
standings.

Iowa (2-1, 14-9)
The 
Hawkeyes 
have 
some 

powerful hitters and a strong 
veteran squad leading them this 
season. Senior infielder Mason 
McCoy earned Big Ten Conference 
Player of the Week recently after 
hitting .438 and picking up six RBI 
over four games. McCoy and his 
teammate junior first baseman 
Jake Adams trade off leading the 

conference in offensive statistics.

McCoy leads the Big Ten in runs 

(26) and doubles (9), while Adams 
takes the top slot in RBI (31) and 
home runs (9).

At the beginning of the season, 

the focus for Iowa was on strong 
pitching and defense, but it has been 
in the box where the Hawkeyes 
have excelled — ranked second in 
the conference for team batting 
average with .286.

While Iowa’s pitching hasn’t 

been as stellar as anticipated, it has 
a deep staff that could easily pick 
up as the conference schedule gets 
going.

Nebraska (0-0, 13-10)
A trio of sophomore infielder 

Angelo 
Antavilla, 
freshman 

outfielder Mojo Hagge and junior 
outfielder Scott Schreiber make up 
the majority of Nebraska’s offense. 
They are currently batting .366, .333 
and .326, respectively, and combine 
for 46 of the Cornhuskers’ 98 RBI.

Nebraska also possesses dual 

threats on both sides of the ball 
with juniors Luis Alvardo and left-
hander Jake Meyers. Meyers has a 
.280 batting average, but also posts 
a 2.01 ERA and is 4-1 on the season, 
while Alvardo bats .270 but also 
records a 3.00 ERA.

The use of players on both sides 

of the ball allows them to gauge the 
strike zone better, allowing them to 
pitch in the zone and know when to 
hit.

With 
three 
well-established 

players on offense, the improvement 
of Meyers and Alvardo throughout 
the season will bring much-needed 
depth to the Cornhuskers’ lineup. 

Nebraska has seven consistent 

starters, but otherwise often rotate 
the rest of its roster into the game, 
providing experience that could be 
crucial late in the Big Ten season.

Ohio State (0-3, 10-14)
Ohio State isn’t just responsible 

for ending the Spartans’ 2016 
season, but the Buckeyes also 
defeated Michigan in the opening 
round of the Big Ten Tournament 
last year, a loss that played an 
important role in the Wolverines’ 
NCAA Tournament hopes. The 
Buckeyes went on to clinch the 
Big Ten title, but this season, a 
championship may not be in Ohio 
State’s grasp.

The loss of 13 players to the MLB 

Draft and graduation leaves the 
Buckeyes in a rebuilding year. Ohio 
State sits nearly last in the Big Ten 
in team batting average (.240) and 
in fielding percentage (.960).

The Buckeyes were forced to 

replace their entire starting infield 
as well, creating spots that their 17 
newcomers would surely be glad to 
fill.

Still, Ohio State’s biggest strength 

is on the bump, but it sits in eighth 
place in the Big Ten.

Senior right-hander Jake Post 

has made the most appearances for 
the Buckeyes, but is just 1-1 on the 
year. Ohio State’s best reliever is 
redshirt junior right-hander Austin 
Woodby, who has a 2.45 ERA and is 
2-0.

The Buckeyes began last season 

outside of the preseason poll, just as 
they did this year, but finished the 
season on top — proving that Ohio 
State can’t be counted out. 

Purdue (1-2, 13-11)
While 
the 
Boilermakers 

currently sit in the middle of the 
Big Ten, they have made headlines 
through junior right-hander Tanner 
Andrews. He has already won Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Week twice and 
has a 3.55 ERA.

Purdue is fresh off a loss to 

Valparaiso where the pitching staff 
earned 13 strikeouts, but the offense 
couldn’t support them as they fell, 
5-1.

The midweek game may not 

have brought the confidence the 
Boilermakers were hoping for, 
especially as they enter a weekend 
series against defending Big Ten 
champions Ohio State. 

Penn State (0-0, 10-13)
The Nittany Lions will open their 

conference slate in Ann Arbor this 
weekend, and while their season 
has been relatively mediocre, senior 
catcher Alex Malinsky is back in the 
lineup and may provide the spark 
that Penn State needs.

Malinsky missed the beginning 

of the season after he took a ball 
off his face in practice, but since 
returning to his team he has wasted 
no time. Though he’s only had seven 
at bats, Malinsky’s hitting .429 and 
has a .714 slugging percentage. His 
injury has not slowed him down, an 
attitude that the Nittany Lions may 
need as they continue the rest of the 
season.

A new family for Miles Lewis

Little did Miles Lewis know 

that one text would change his 
life – that a lone message was the 
first step towards him becoming 
a Michigan Wolverine. 

That message came last April, 

while Lewis was still a member 
of the North Dakota baseball 
team and his then-coach Jeff 
Dodson urgently demanded a 
team meeting.

“I got a text from my coach 

that said ‘If you have class 
right now, you have to miss it,’ ” 
Lewis recalls. “And the athletic 
director came in and told us 
the news that the program 
was getting cut (at the end of 
the season) and said good luck 
basically.”

After 115 years, the Fighting 

Hawks baseball program was 
dropped as part of budget 
restructuring that also saw 
the golf program evaporated. 
The cuts were estimated to 
save the university $720,000 in 
operating budgets and salaries 
according to KVRR.com, the 
school’s local news station. 
The announcement came mid-
season and was unexpected, 
even for the coaches.

Losing the team marked the 

end of a baseball career for most 
players on the roster. Lewis 
wasn’t most players.

He redshirted his first year at 

North Dakota while recovering 
from a double labrum injury 
suffered while playing high 
school football. In his first season 
of play, Lewis led the Fighting 
Hawks in home runs, hits, 
slugging percentage, total bases, 
stolen bases and batting average 
(at .360). His impressive stat 
sheet earned him a Louisville 
Slugger Freshman All-American 

nod 

and 
2016 

Western 
Athletic 

Conference 
Freshman 

of 
the 
Year 
honors. 
Most 

importantly, it turns out, his 
high level of play drew attention 
from many programs throughout 
the country.

For the team’s most talented 

players, such as Lewis, the cut 
merely meant they would be 
moving on.

“As soon as the word got 

out that they were dropping 
their program, I think every 
competitive recruiter went right 
to the stat page,” said Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 
“(They) 

looked at their top pitcher, a kid 
named Zach Muckenhirn and 
their top hitter, Miles Lewis.”

Bakich 
was 
right. 
Miles 

not only drew attention from 
Michigan, 
but 
other 
major 

programs 
including 
Iowa, 

Oregon and Creighton. This sort 
of notoriety was new for Lewis. 
His shoulder injuries forced 
Lewis to miss the high school 
baseball season his senior year, 
which deterred many college 
recruiters.

“Getting recruited by big 

schools was kind of a new 
experience 
for 
me,” 
Lewis 

recalls. 
“That 
really 
didn’t 

happen for me in high school.”

***

Lewis attended Hudson High 

School in Hudson, Wis., where 
he was an All-State selection 
in baseball as well as Academic 
All-State in baseball, football 
and basketball. For a while, 
he considered playing college 
football instead of baseball. 
However, inspired by his older 
brother Mitch – who is 27 and 
played baseball at University of 
Wisconsin - La Crosse – Miles 
stuck to baseball.

“(Baseball) was something 

that my brother always loved 
growing up,” Lewis said. “And 

he was my biggest role model 
and I just wanted to follow in his 
footsteps.”

Following 
in 
Mitch’s 

footsteps turned into a mutual 
bond in which the two challenge 
and motivate each other. While 
Miles feels that his older brother 
is a role model for him, Mitch 
finds this ironic.

“It’s good to hear (that I 

motivate him) but I feel like 
he motivates me to be better,” 
Mitch said. “It’s amazing to see 
him work so hard in not only 
baseball, but also his academics. 
To balance those two and play 
at such a high level, it really 
motivates me to take on more 
challenges and better myself.”

The brothers’ competitiveness 

also drives the duo to succeed. 
Their brotherly rivalry extends 
from 
the 
baseball 
diamond, 

where Mitch claims that he is the 
“smarter ballplayer while Miles 
is the more athletically talented 
player,” to the living room, where 
playing Mario Kart and Mario 
Party Three have become some 
of their favorite pastimes.

Laughing, Mitch contests that, 

“Miles is a very good baseball 
player, but he is a very average 
Mario Kart player.” Miles, on 
the other hand, is quick to refute 
this statement, asserting that he 
is one of the best players in the 
state of Wisconsin.

However, 
the 
one 
thing 

they can agree on is that they 
owe thanks to their father for 
introducing them to baseball 
and inspiring the two to play. 
Their father taught them the 
game, coaching them in some 
capacity from tee-ball all the 
way through high school.

Now, Miles eagerly anticipates 

his father and the rest of his 
family attending a game at Ray 

Fisher Stadium and watching 
him play in a Wolverine uniform 
for the first time.

***

When 
the 
North 
Dakota 

program was cut, Lewis wasn’t 
concerned that it would mark 
the end of his baseball career. 
That didn’t make saying goodbye 
to the friends he had made any 
easier. It was difficult to leave 
behind the life that he had 
become accustomed to and the 
teammates he considered family.

“It was a very emotional 

time,” Lewis explained. “Having 
to leave your best friends that 
you’ve known for years and 
some great coaches. It was really 
tough, but it all works out.”

Fortunately for Lewis, it seems 

as one door closed, another 
one opened. Shortly after the 
program cut was announced, 
coach Bakich took a trip to 
North Dakota to see Lewis play. 
The two went out to dinner and 
Lewis visited the team in Ann 
Arbor a few weeks later.

“The one thing that stuck 

out to me was the coaches here 
and how much energy they 
have,” Lewis recalls. “And how 
much they can help from a 
developmental standpoint and 
the fact that they love winning 
here.”

And for Bakich and Michigan, 

Lewis was the ideal person to 
replace the now-graduated left 
fielder Matt Ramsay.

“It just lined up,” Bakich said. 

“Not only the baseball program 
and our development and how 
we do things, but the school 
academically. He was a 4.0 
student at North Dakota, never 
got one B in any class. It seemed 
like all the pieces fell into place 
and he was a perfect fit.”

Another thing that stood 

out to Bakich – or anyone in 
Lewis’ presence – is his athletic 
build and sheer size. Listed at 
6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Bakich 
describes Miles physique as a 
“football body” and as someone 
who “could play tailback for 
coach Harbaugh.”

“He’s 
just 
absolutely 

shredded, ripped, very strong,” 
Bakich awed. “It’s like he’s out of 
a muscle and fitness magazine.”

Fortunately, 
his 
abilities 

as a ballplayer were equally 
impressive. 
Lewis 
is 
what 

Bakich describes as a multi-tool 
player – a switch hitter who can 
get on base, drive in runs, steal 
bases and make web-gem plays 
in the field.

Now a redshirt sophomore 

left fielder, Lewis has lived up 
to the expectations and has 
showed off his various tools. 
Primarily 
batting 
fourth 

or fifth in the lineup – 
spots typically designated 
for a team’s best hitters 
– Lewis is currently 
boasting a .302 batting 
average with 14 runs 
batted in, 15 runs scored 
and eight stolen bases. 
Additionally, Lewis has 
committed no errors 
on the season.

While 
the 
left 

fielder feels that he 
has progressed in all 
facets of his game 
in his short time as 
a Wolverine, his 
defense is what he 
has seen improve 
most – something 
on full display 
Tuesday, 
when 

he 
robbed 

Toledo of an 
extra base hit 
on 
a 
diving 

catch.

This 
sort 
of 
effort 
and 

intensity has become the norm 
from Lewis in games and during 
training.

“He stands out in all of our 

training sessions and all of our 
practices,” Bakich said. “He’s 
always 
diving, 
he’s 
always 

hustling 
(and) 
he’s 
always 

going full speed. He has no off 
switch. You’re never going to 
need to prompt him, he’s a self-
starter. He’s on go all the time... 
He could have a bad game and 
bounce right back and have a 
great game.”

Lewis 
isn’t 
all 
business, 

though. His roommate – junior 
catcher Brock Keener – was 
quick to point out that he is “fun 
to be around and real goofy.”

That much was clear this 

past 
Wednesday, 
as 
Lewis 

was juggling baseballs with 
teammates in the dugout after 
turning in a 2-for-4 effort in the 
Wolverines’ routing of Central 
Michigan.

That comradery was almost 

instantaneous, 
as 
Lewis 

credited the group for making 
him one of their own from the 
second he stepped on campus.

“The moment I got here it 

was like a new family,” Lewis 
explains. “All the guys are really 
great.”

That’s not to say his North 

Dakota family is gone, though. 
Lewis still texts his former 
teammates. He still visits them 
when he’s back in Wisconsin. 
The North Dakota program 
is 
gone, 
and 
it’s 
certainly 

unfortunate.

But with his new career 

unfolding in Ann Arbor, Lewis 
explains, “I don’t really like to 
live in the past too much. You 
just have to play the game and 
not think too much about it.”

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Redshirt sophomore left fielder Miles Lewis transferred from North Dakota after its program was cut, and is now enjoying early success with the Wolverines.

Taking a punch

O

n the surface, it 
would appear that the 
memory of Michigan’s 

painful collapse down the 
stretch last season has faded 
away. The Wolverines (19-6 
overall, 1-2 Big Ten) sit 
comfortably in the national 
rankings, have scored the 
second-most runs in the Big 
Ten and have the best earned-
run average of any team in the 
conference. 

Essentially, the 2017 

Michigan baseball team looks 
a lot like the 2016 team did for 
most of its season.

Throughout his career, 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
has held a reputation for his 
dynamic and energetic nature. 
His vigor has been a key 
driving force in the program’s 
resurgence – from taking the 
Wolverines from 22-34 the 
year before his arrival, to a 
39-25 record and Big Ten title 
in his third season, and to a 

34-12 start in 2016.

For Bakich, last year’s 

finish – a 2-9 slump at the end 
of the season which left the 
Wolverines outside the NCAA 
Tournament – presented an 
opportunity to return to the 
foundation for what made 
Michigan’s 
turnaround 
over the last 
few seasons 
possible in the 
first place. 
While the 2016 
Wolverines 
rode the 
momentum of a 
surprise run to 
the postseason 
the year 
before, this 
year’s team has perhaps a more 
powerful force fueling them.

“The way we did not finish 

the season strong last year 
was the impetus to get back 
to those roots of mental 
toughness training to prepare 
us for any adversity that 
strikes,” Bakich said.

It’s no surprise that Bakich 

loves describing his team 

in fighting terms, with an 
emphasis on taking and 
throwing punches. One of 
the Wolverines’ traditions 
after each game is to hand 
out an award – an object 
representative of the team’s 
mentality and spirit – to the 

player who 
made the biggest 
impact that game. 
Last season, the 
award was a hard 
hat. This year, it’s 
a pair of boxing 
gloves.

“We’ve been 

down, we’ve 
taken punches, 
we’ve given up 
big innings and 
had to fight 

back,” Bakich said. “That was 
something that was a large 
target that we wanted to hit 
head on to be a tougher team.”

Resiliency – whether 

shown in late-inning surges 
and comebacks, scoring 
immediately after giving up 
runs, or simply fighting to keep 
at-bats alive – is the central 
message. Already, Michigan 

has won four games in the 
ninth inning or later, after 
winning just two such games 
a season ago. The Wolverines 
have outscored their opponent 
in 67 innings, while being 
outscored in just 38. They’ve 
scored in 36 percent of their 
innings, but that 
number goes up 
to 41 percent 
when they’ve 
surrendered a 
run the inning 
before.

At the plate, 

Michigan 
has displayed 
patience and 
grit by drawing 
walks in 14 
percent of 
its at-bats, as opposed to 11 
percent last season, and has 
shown a newfound aggression 
on the basepaths, having stolen 
57 bases already – or three less 
than it did all of last season. 

Many of the key contributors 

of last year’s team – junior 
left-hander Oliver Jaskie, 
third baseman Drew Lugbauer, 
first baseman Jake Bivens 

and senior catcher Harrison 
Wenson – are back for another 
season, so this steely resolve 
isn’t one that just appeared 
out of nowhere. Instead, this 
mental toughness training was 
the focus of the Wolverines’ 
offseason; a conscious effort 

to gear them 
for the ups and 
downs of a long 
season.

“Whether 

it’s military or 
other sports 
teams or other 
competitive 
sports that do 
similar training 
to strengthen 
that competitive 
mindset, it’s 

absolutely a skill that can 
be developed,” Bakich said. 
“Toughness, confidence, 
leadership – everybody comes 
into this world with a certain 
level, but those are all skills 
that can be developed, and 
those are three things that we 
invest a lot of time on in this 
program.”

Added Bivens: “Some of 

it’s inherent, but I think this 
team has trained harder than 
anyone in the country. (Bakich 
has) built that toughness into 
us, and we are a group of 
fighters.”

With pitchers like Jaskie, 

who possesses a 3.44 ERA and 
42 strikeouts in 34 innings, 
and a batting order that’s 
dangerous top to bottom, 
there’s never been any doubt 
about Michigan’s ability to 
throw a punch. But that was 
true last season.

Currently, the Wolverines 

are knocking on the doorstep 
of national prominence. But 
with quality opponents such 
as Michigan State, Indiana 
and Oklahoma awaiting 
this month, the question of 
whether they can take a punch 
needs a definitive answer in 
order for Michigan to break 
through.

And so far this season, the 

answer to that question has 
been a resounding ‘yes’.
