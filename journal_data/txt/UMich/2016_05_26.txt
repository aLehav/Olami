Hillary Clinton addresses annual union meeting at the Cobo Center in Detroit

Candidate pivots to 
general election at 
speech to organized 

labor in Detroit

By LYDIA MURRAY and 

LARA MOEHLMAN

Summer Managing News Editor 

and Summer Editor in Chief

DETROIT— 
Democratic 

frontrunner 
Hillary 
Clinton 

returned 
to 
Detroit 
Monday, 

where she addressed thousands at 
a Service Employees International 
Union convention at the Cobo 
Center. 
During 
her 
remarks 

she issued biting criticism of 
presumptive Republican nominee 
Donald Trump in addition to 
discussing reforms to minimum 
wage and child care.

The 
SEIU, 
a 
union 

headquartered 
in 
Washington 

D.C., has a membership of over 
1.9 million workers spanning the 
United States, Puerto Rico and 
Canada. Membership is comprised 
of mostly health care workers — 

including home care, nursing home 
and hospital employees. Many 
other members occupy public 
service or property management 
positions, 
including 
custodial, 

security and food service jobs.

SEIU is also a major force of 

support for such labor reforms 
as the Obama administration’s 
Affordable Care Act, increased 
minimum wage laws and wage 
increases for food workers — 
many of which are supported by 
Clinton’s campaign.

During her remarks, Clinton 

reaffirmed 
her 
support 
for 

the SEIU and all its members, 
thanking them for their continued 
support for her campaign.

The SEIU officially endorses 

Clinton; however, in the state 
of 
Michigan 
— 
which 
has 

traditionally voted for Democratic 
candidates — this year the contest 
is more unpredictable with the 
majority of current polls showing 
Clinton 
defeating 
presumptive 

Republican 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump by several points, but 
several showing a tie or virtual 
tie in the state, according to 
RealClearPolitics.

Clinton currently plans an 

early focus on Rust Belt states, 
including 
Michigan, 
where 

there are an abundance of white, 
working class voters — a group 
from which Trump has received 
a large portion of his support. A 
recent CBS/New York Times poll 
showed him leading with white 
voters without a college degree by 
20 points over Clinton.

The Clinton campaign has also 

announced a shift in attention 
to the general election, noted 
through her attacks on Trump 
during her remarks.

Clinton 
notably 
attacked 

Trump’s 
business 
record, 

suggesting his accomplishments 
are not as grand as he makes them 
out to be.

“He could bankrupt America 

like 
he’s 
bankrupted 
his 

companies,” Clinton said. “I mean, 
ask yourself: How can anybody 
lose money running a casino? 
Really.”

Clinton also spoke out against 

Trump’s stances on immigration, 
in which he has stated he 
plans to deport all 11 million 
undocumented immigrants in the 
United States. Clinton emphasized 

Residents say 

administration’s 

compliance ‘ushers 

in a new era’

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

Facing 
concerted 
community 

opposition, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
announced 
Tuesday 

that it would be cancelling the 
construction of its controversial 
North 
Campus 
transportation 

maintenance center.

The 
facility 
was 
originally 

approved by the Board of Regents 
in 2014 and was intended to serve as 
a repair center for the University’s 
fleet of buses and other vehicles. 
However, as the project began to 
move forward in February, nearby 
residents openly opposed it amid 
concerns of air pollution and traffic 
congestion.

Under pressure from Ann Arbor 

homeowners’ 
associations 
and 

City Council members, University 
President Mark Schlissel postponed 
the project in March to negotiate 
with community stakeholders.

The 
Northeast 
Ann 
Arbor 

Community Coalition — which 
represents nearby residents opposed 
to the project and numbers about 
600 households — has continued 
to protest the board’s meetings and 
recently called on its members to 
halt donations to the University, 
claiming the negotiation process 
continues to lack transparency.

This conflict is one of the latest 

between the University and city 
of Ann Arbor partially stemming 
from the University’s ability to 
largely circumvent city zoning laws

Harvard 
prof. talks 
criminal 
justice and
racial bias

Panel criticizes mass 

incarceration and 
racialized policies

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Summer News Editor

Elizabeth Hinton, an assistant 

professor of history and African 
and African American studies at 
Harvard University, sat down with 
three panelists to present her new 
book, “From the War on Poverty to 
the War on Crime: The Making of 
Mass Incarceration in America,” 
at Literati bookstore Wednesday 
evening. More than 40 audience 
members participated in a discussion 
on the racialized American prison 
system and criminal justice reform. 

The panel included two University 

of Michigan faculty members — 

Heather Thompson, a professor 
of history and Afroamerican and 
African studies, and Reuben Miller, 
an assistant professor in the School 
of Social Work, and community 
organizer Ronald Simpson-Bey, the 
alumni associate for Just Leadership 
USA — an organization dedicated to 
reducing the nation’s imprisoned 
population. 

Hinton, an Ann Arbor native and 

former assistant professor in the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African studies at the University, 
introduced 
her 
book’s 
themes, 

which point to the historical roots of 
mass incarceration in the bipartisan 
welfare policies first introduced 
by Lyndon Johnson in the late ‘60s 
and the negative consequences of 
imprisonment on communities. 

“The origins of mass incarceration 
begin at the height of the civil 
rights movement ... I’d identify 
root causes to be employment, 
schools, lack of housing,” she said. 
“This book looks at how we can get 
to a more equitable and just society 
in the U.S.” 

Miller built upon Hinton’s 

argument, 
drawing 
a 
direct 

relationship between slavery and 
modern-day targeted policing and 
punishment. 

“This is connecting so many dots 

historically, not just theoretically,” 
Miller said. “Policies in the ‘60s 
picked up the old discourses of 
the post-Reconstruction era that 
already linked Blackness with 
criminality, 
dependence 
(and) 

poverty.” 

The speakers also couched their 

remarks in light of decarceration 
efforts on both state and federal 
levels 
— 
President 
Barack 

Obama issued executive actions 
earlier this year ending solitary 
confinement for juvenile offenders 
in 
federal 
prisons 
and 
has 

advocated for relief on mandatory 
minimum sentencing for drug-
related offenses, while Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) has publicly stated his 

support for criminal justice reform. 
Thompson pushed back, however, 
and 
criticized 
policymakers’ 

measures as surface-level efforts. 

“We can have sentencing reform, 

we can build extraordinary reentry 
programs, we can do all sorts of 
heavy lifting,” she said. “But if we 
don’t tackle these fundamental 
assumptions 
about 
Black 

criminality, we won’t fix it. Indeed, 
what we will do is package it anew in 
equally troubling wrapping.” 

Hinton 
offered 
a 
number 

of 
solutions 
from 
providing 

direct 
funding 
for 
community 

organizations 
to 
instating 

restorative programs in prisons, 
which would help provide inmates 
with education and employment 
opportunities. Simpson-Bey, who 
also spent 27 years in a Michigan 
state prison on a wrongful murder 
conviction, went further to suggest 
a complete overhaul of attitudes on 
race and class in years to come.

“We dismiss changing hearts as 

an individual level thing, but people 
walk in with these attitudes to make 
policy,” he said. “This is about deep 
empathy. This thing affects all of 
us.” 

Thompson predicted Hinton’s 

book will be a transformative book 
in criminal justice circles. 

“You begin to realize what a 

huge job it will be to undo this,” 
Thompson said. “There are many 
layers of assumption about Black 
communities that were there from 
the beginning ... it’s not about doing 
it more humanely or cheaply.”

New Ross dean stresses importance

Cardiac surgeries 

transferred to 

University hospitals

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter 

Veterans Affairs (VA) Ann Arbor 

Healthcare System raised concerns 
over contamination of surgical trays 
following the recent discovery of 
particulate matter on operating room 
equipment.

Derek Atkinson, the Ann Arbor VA 

public affairs officer, wrote in a press 
release Tuesday that the matter was 
identified by an investigation and that 
it was localized to operating room 
surgical trays. 

“Through 
the 
routine 
tray 

inspection process, VA OR (Operating 
Room) staff proactively identify 
particulate and the tray is removed 
from use prior to surgery,” Atkinson 
wrote in the statement. “The health 
system has brought in a variety of 
experts over the past months to fully 
eradicate this problem.”

Atkinson cited last fall’s water 

pipe break as a potential source of the 
particulate contamination, according 
to the investigation by local experts. 
The proximity of the sterilization 
facility to the water pipe burst, he 
noted, could have contributed to 
the increased number of unusable 
surgical trays.

“Although the Ann Arbor VA has 

maintained a high volume of surgeries 
since the repair of a water pipe break 
adjacent to the sterile processing area 
last fall, sterile particulate continues 
to be found in some trays,” Atkinson 
wrote.

In response to the contamination, 

a portion of the surgical cases, in 
particular cardiac surgeries, has 
been transferred to the University of 
Michigan Health System. This move 
was a precaution taken due to the 
frequent turnover rate of surgical 
trays used in open-heart surgery. In 
an interview with the Daily, Atkinson 
said he hoped to return those 
operations quickly.

“We are looking to bring cardiac 

surgery back as soon as possible,” 
Atkinson said.

Atkinson also noted that, despite 

the precautions they are taking, the 
concerns over the surgical trays were 
isolated to the trays only and have not 
threatened the hospital’s sterilized 
surgical equipment.

“We still have some work to do 

to make sure that, whenever an 
OR nurse opens a tray, there is no 
particulate matter,” he said. “The 
presence of this particulate, however, 
is intermittent, so it doesn’t happen 
with every tray, and it is even unlikely 
that this sterile particulate is even 
harmful, but it shouldn’t be there, 
and we are working to make sure that 
no trays have this issue to ensure the 
high quality of care for our veterans.”

Until the source of the particulate 

is identified and fixed, all cases of 
cardiac surgery will continue to be 
sent primarily to UHS at the expense 
of VA.

Tuesday, U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) and Tim Walberg 
(R–Tipton) released a statement 
addressing the ongoing concerns 
over the presence of the particulate 
matter and responding to a meeting 
held last Sunday between officials 
from the Ann Arbor VA and the 
Representatives, 
in 
which 
they 

discussed the concerns. 

In their statement, Dingell and 

Walberg wrote that the VA acted 
appropriately in its response to the 
potential source of contamination 
and worked with local sterilization 
experts to resolve the intermittent 
issue.

“This issue came to light because 

they were doing their job inspecting 
surgical instruments and discovered 
the problem,” the statement read. 
“To be clear, it does not appear that 
the particulate issue has caused an 
infection or harm to a patient.”

Dingell 
and 
Walberg 
also 

announced 
their 
intentions 
to 

introduce 
bipartisan 
legislation 

aimed 
at 
increasing 
reporting 

requirements within VA hospitals to 
improve transparency.

“We believe it is important that, 

like other hospitals, the VA should be 
open and transparent and report the 
number of patients that have acquired 
surgical infections while receiving 
care at the VA, and the number of 
surgeries that have been canceled 
or moved to another hospital,” they 
wrote.

DeRue appointed 
after 9 years in 
business faculty 

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

Scott DeRue was named dean 

of the Stephen M. Ross School 
of Business last Thursday at the 
University 
Board 
of 
Regents 

meeting. In an interview with 
the Daily, DeRue discussed the 
importance of higher education 
and how innovation will be the 
focus of his deanship.

DeRue credits his grandfather 

and parents for instilling an 
appreciation for education that 
was absent in the rest of the 
rural North Carolina community 
in which he grew up. When he 
arrived to the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill — his 
grandfather’s alma mater — as a 
freshman, DeRue was exposed 
to the transformational power of 
higher education.

“In my community, higher 

education was the exception, not 
the norm,” DeRue said. “When 
I went (to UNC) my eyes were 
opened in terms of what the 
possibilities were for a kid from 
a small town in rural North 
Carolina.”

After 
completing 
his 

undergraduate 
education, 

DeRue worked in private equity, 
management consulting and he 
managed a luxury yacht company. 

However, his desire to contribute 
to higher education persisted, 
and he left the private sector, 
earning a Ph.D. in management 
and organizational behavior from 
Michigan State University in 2009 
before joining the University of 
Michigan faculty.

DeRue said he spent many 

years learning for himself what 
he wanted his mark on the world 
to be and eventually landed on 
higher education.

“I went through a long process 

of figuring out who I want to 
be, what’s the impact I want to 
have, what’s the legacy I want to 
create,” DeRue said. “And for me, 
the answer ultimately was to be a 
part of higher education, to create 
ideas and research that mattered, 
that really was shaping important 
conversations in business.”

Now DeRue says he hopes to 

extend the same transformational 
opportunities he had in his 
undergraduate years to other 
students.

Prior to his appointment to a 

five-year renewable term as dean of 
Ross, DeRue served as the faculty 
director of the Sanger Leadership 
Center, which promotes leadership 
education, and faculty director of 
the Emerging Leaders Program, 
an executive education program 
for mid-level managers — both of 
which are Ross programs. In 2014, 
DeRue was promoted to associate 
dean for executive education and 
has served associate dean for the 
part-time and Executive MBA 
programs for the past six months.

DeRue also emphasized the 

potential for Business School 
graduates and faculty research 
to make a positive impact on the 
broader world, such as through 
interdisciplinary applications of 
business research and education.

“Business, in my opinio,n is the 

most powerful force for positive 
force in the world,” DeRue said. 
“We want our faculty and students 
coming up with ideas through 
their research, through their 
academics, that are going to shape 
the future of business in important 
ways.”

“There are over 130 graduate 

programs on campus, and 101 of 
those are ranked in the top 10 of 
their discipline and business, as 
an institution, cuts across every 
one of them,” DeRue added. “The 
Business School has something 
to say about healthcare, so does 
the School of Medicine, so does 
the School of Public Health, so 
does the School of Nursing and 
probably so does the School of 
Social Work as well.”

Once he officially assumes his 

position on July 1, DeRue hopes 
to foster an environment within 
the Business School that would 
optimize for accomplishing these 
goals, rather than leading from 
the front.

“If you talk to deans that have 

done really well, and really had 
an impact through their deanship, 
they are a visionary force for

M

onday, I attended the 
Service 
Employees 

International Union’s 

(SEIU) International Convention 
in 
Detroit 

to 
observe 

remarks 
by 

Democratic 
presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton. While 
the union officially endorses 
Clinton, and has done so since 
November, the convention was a 
big indicator of how the rapid rise 
of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) 
has affected their endorsement. 
The SEIU isn’t just a group of 
service workers who chose to 
have a convention in Detroit, but 
they’re also the biggest outside 
spenders for the Democratic 
Party, having spent $69 million 
on President Obama’s re-election 
campaign in 2012. The union also 
has about two million members, 
many of whom are voters in 
the United States. Having the 
financial and voting support 
of the union is crucial to any 
candidate hoping to win middle- 
and working-class voters. 

While 
Secretary 
Clinton’s 

30-minute speech touched on 
many important issues, perhaps 
the most important message of 
the speech was a message that 
was never said — the persistence 
of 
Sanders. 
Only 
once 
did 

Clinton utter his name, saying, 
“I applaud Sen. Sanders and 
his supporters for challenging 
us.” Despite the fact that many 
of the core tenants of the union 
are those that are deeply held 
by 
Sanders, 
Clinton 
glossed 

over him in favor of ripping on 
projected Republican nominee 
Donald Trump. This came as a 
surprise to me, as throughout 
the convention hall, many Fight 
for $15 and Black Lives Matter 
signs could be seen waving in the 
crowd. Even several convention 
delegates had Bernie Sanders 

stickers pinned to their shirts 
as a quiet sign of protest to the 
union’s 
official 
endorsement 

of Clinton. By ignoring the 
divisions within the crowd 
in favor of an anti-Trump 
message, Clinton is effectively 
refocusing her campaign away 
from the primaries, and into 
the general election. 

I believe that the message 

perpetuated by the Clinton 
campaign is a correct one. 
Sanders, though a noble fighter 
for the causes that he believes 
in, has lost the election. Despite 
what many of his supporters 
may say, there is no real chance 
for Bernie Sanders to win the 
Democratic nomination. Even 
if he wins the remaining states 
by a two-to-one landslide, he 
will still not be close enough to 
secure the nomination.

The time is now for the 

Democratic Party to get its act 
together. Sanders supporters 
can no longer wait until the 
convention to decide whom to 
support. Clinton is the right 
choice for all of us, regardless 
of how liberal we may be or 
what identities we may have. 
She also has the skills to handle 
the very important job that 
is the presidency, rather than 
simply ushering in a political 
revolution that we may not be 
able to control. We can’t sit 
around and call Clinton a liar, 
or hold her accountable for 
her husband’s policies. Clinton 
is a reality, and that reality is 
moving forward at light speed.

While supporters of Sanders 

may be quick to join the Never 
Hillary 
movement, 
instead 

favoring a write-in vote for 
Sanders, 
I 
challenge 
those 

who are so deeply opposed 
to Clinton to see beyond this 
race 
and 
into 
the 
greater 

repercussions of their votes. 
While it may not be pleasant 

for some to vote for Clinton, 
it is something that must be 
done. Additionally, the cost 
of Sanders and his supporters 
becoming more hostile toward 
Clinton can already be realized. 
The Republican establishment 
is already starting to fall in 
line behind their presumptive 
nominee. The costs of a Trump 
presidency to the Democratic 
Party and our nation as a whole 
would 
be 
insurmountable. 

Clinton even stated in her speech 
to the SEIU that she will “use 
the bully pulpit to stand up for 
working families” rather than 
being “a bully in the pulpit.” If 
Republicans can get together 
behind a bully, then why can’t 
Democrats get together behind a 
fighter for equality for everyone?

All Democrats — be it the 

millennial 
college 
students 

like myself or working-class 
Americans 
like 
my 
parents 

— need to fall in line behind 
Clinton. Not only is she one of 
the most qualified candidates 
in recent history, she is also the 
candidate that will continue 
the hard work of President 
Obama into the future, while 
expanding 
rights 
for 
those 

who are held down by society’s 
barriers. Backing the future 
nominee isn’t a radical idea, 
but it is a classic example of 
putting the future trajectory 
of the country above a political 
ideology.

At the end of the day, the 

2016 election will come down 
to Clinton versus Trump. The 
only thing standing between 
Trump and the White House 
is the full and unwavering 
support of every single Sanders 
supporter 
behind 
the 
real 

Democratic nominee — Hillary 
Rodham Clinton.

 Your vote matters

W

hen Yousef Rabhi ran 
in 
the 
Democratic 

primary race on Aug. 

3, 2010, turnout 
was low. By the 
time the ballots 
were counted for 
the 
Democratic 

seat of the 11th 
District’s Washtenaw County Board 
of Commissioners seat, unofficial 
results had Yousef at 998 votes and 
his primary opponent, Mike Fried, at 
997 votes. 

Elections decided by one vote 

don’t happen that often. In a country 
of almost 320 million people, the 
likelihood of a single voter swaying a 
national election is statistically very 
unlikely.

I heard this all the time when I 

was registering voters on campus. 
People would say that their votes 
don’t count and they probably never 
will. In my work on millennial 
voter engagement, I am probably 
never going to singlehandedly shift 
an election. But in preparation for 
the Democratic Michigan primary, 
Students for Sanders - Ann Arbor 
(a group that I led) registered 
approximately 
600 
voters. 
The 

primary was decided by fewer than 
20,000 votes, meaning that the 
students who were registered voters 
could not have made up for more 
than three percent of the margin by 
which Bernie Sanders won. Getting 
people excited about engaging in 
the democratic process was still one 
of the best experiences of my life, 
and here is case for why your vote 
matters:

In 2000, Florida’s electoral college 

seats were decided by 537 votes 
and the victory ultimately gave 
George W. Bush the presidency. The 
implications of this victory are hard 
to do justice to and even harder to 
quantify, but it’s worth repeating that 
a presidential election could have 
been swayed if 269 voters decided 
to vote for Gore instead of Bush, or if 
537 more voters decided to show up.

In too many ways, the deck seems 

stacked against getting millennials 
like myself to turn out. In an election 
on a millage held May 3 this year, 
turnout was a paltry 12.13 percent, 
with 32,492 voters participating in 
Washtenaw County. In 2014, only 
21.3 percent of 18 to 29 year olds 
turned out to vote in the midterm 
elections. Let’s make sure that 
doesn’t happen again in 2018.

This election was held the week 

after the Winter 2016 semester ended, 
so it was clearly difficult for students 
to show up, particularly those from 
out of state who were more likely to 

go home. There was also very limited 
information 
available 
to 
make 

informed decisions. The main video 
prepared by the Western Washtenaw 
Democrats on behalf of this had 11 
views on YouTube as of May 22.

Beyond 
obtaining 
quality 

information, simply ensuring that 
one is registered to vote can also be 
an uphill battle. States like California 
and Oregon have recently passed 
laws that make it considerably 
harder to slip through the cracks. 
In 
California, 
for 
example, 

when one registers for his or her 
driver’s license at the DMV, one is 
automatically registered to vote (and 
has to specifically opt out if he or 
she does not want to be registered). 
Passing laws like this will remove a 
necessary hurdle for being involved 
in the democratic process and raise 
the likelihood of voter turnout 
considerably. 
The 
democratic 

process in Michigan would benefit 
from passing a similar law and voter 
turnout across all elections would 
likely increase.

Turnout in elections is also clearly 

higher in years where the presidency is 
on the ballot. That means that this year 
will likely see much higher turnout 
than we saw in the 2014 midterm 
elections, when just 36.4 percent of 
voters made their voices heard.

In order to ensure high turnout in 

2016 and in the midterm elections in 
2018, the state of Michigan needs to 
make it easier for citizens to register 
to vote and to obtain objective, quality 
information.

To maintain the level of momentum 

seen on the Democratic side through 
Sanders’ presidential campaign, a 
group called Brand New Congress was 
created by former campaign staffers 
to continue channeling energy into 
general election Congressional races. 
This bold strategy has potential to 
capitalize on the political momentum 
from the Bernie revolution and keep 
people 
excited 
about 
upcoming 

elections. Congressional races rarely 
get the press and attention that 
presidential races receive, but they 
have a large impact on the direction 
in 
which 
the 
country 
moves. 

Individual votes are even more 
important in these elections due to 
their lower turnout.

Regardless of whom you vote for 

and whom you support, it is critical 
that we have access to quality 
information about candidates and 
legislation. Voting is a protected 
right and especially in states like 
Michigan, our votes really do matter.

Clinton’s time to shine

KEVIN 
SWEITZER

efore 
winter 
semester 

began, 
I 
was 
glancing 

through the syllabus for my 

Psychology 112 class. Two pages 
into it, I read 
something that 
shocked me: “If 
you take this 
class, you take 
the risk that 
adverse circumstances — illnesses, 
deaths of family and/or friends, 
legal troubles or anything else — 
will cause you to miss two quizzes 
and will lower your final grade. If 
you cannot accept this risk and any 
consequences it may prove to have, 
drop the class now, while you can 
still get your money back.” The 
professor does allow each student 
to drop their lowest quiz grade 
without penalty, which shows that 
he is understanding in some ways, 
but this statement is nonetheless 
unacceptable.

I have every appreciation for all 

that my instructors and GSIs do, 
and for the countless educators I 
know who go above and beyond 
to help their students. In fact, I 
can understand that expecting to 
be allowed to make up work after 
taking an impromptu vacation to 
the Bahamas is unfair. However, put 
yourself in our shoes: imagine that 
you (a professor, dean or whoever 
you are) fall very ill due to a chemo-
stressed immune system, or that 
your father passes away, and you 
are told that you will be penalized 
for work you missed. How would 
you feel?

Recently, there has been a lot 

of talk around campus about 
addressing the stigma of speaking 
about physical and mental health, 
both of which are especially crucial 
at large universities, where students 
can often feel like they are just a 
number. While I use a very specific 
example here, this example points 
to a larger systematic problem. We 
constantly work to keep everything 
running smoothly, like we would a 
machine, but at what cost?

What are we if we are not 

human? Should we not expect 
things to happen in our lives that 
we are not expecting? In fact, 
this last semester, a day after my 
grandfather passed away, I almost 
couldn’t get out of bed to get to 
class. But I did, and there was a 

pop quiz. And in no flippant sense 
of the word, I failed (I got an F). 
But because the syllabus was clear 
that nothing would merit a retake, 
I did nothing. Even though I was 
in the process of grieving a loved 
one, I couldn’t help but feel alone 
and unsupported, as I couldn’t do 
anything about the bad grade I’d 
gotten because my mind had been 
elsewhere (a natural byproduct of 
grieving). 

Additionally, 
according 
to 

countless studies, certain diseases, 
health 
problems 
and 
legal 

troubles, 
among 
other 
things, 

disproportionately affect people 
of certain ethnic groups in society, 
often because of factors out of their 
control (equal access to healthcare, 
healthy food, etc.). By permitting 
rhetoric such as the statements 
in this syllabus, we only add to 
the stress, anxiety, exclusion and 
inequity people in our society face. 
We perpetuate an atmosphere that 
can only make people feel more 
alone in their struggles. And we 
can’t simply tell people not to take 
a class as a replacement, because 
these are often prerequisites for 
classes later on, not to mention 
maintaining equal access to all 
classes is non-negotiable.

Policies such as these can affect 

anyone at any moment, regardless 
of what group they’re in, because 
illness, death and legal troubles 
can come without warning. That’s 
life. And in many ways, I believe we 
have stopped living life and instead 
are trying to prevent it so that 
everything runs smoothly without 
any hitches. But this is simply not 
possible, and we must accept it.

Though 
encouraging 
more 

dialogue on the mental health 
of students on campus is very 
important, we need actionable 
change. Reforming class policies — 
and other strict policies regarding 
due dates and deadlines that do 
more harm than good to already 
stressed, 
hard-working, 
high-

achieving students — can help 
change the unhealthy campus 
climate created around physical 
and mental health and work to 
lessen 
the 
extreme 
pressures 

students face.

Often times, this is the first time 

students are living far from home 
and 
have 
more 
independence, 

which can be stress enough. In fact, 
showing that we are here to support 
students is even more important 
in their first few years of college, 
so understanding policies are even 
more crucial in the big, lower-level 
classes, such as the one I took last 
semester. In fact, we should be 
asking University of Michigan 
administrators to do their part and 
put a school-wide policy in place 
that allows students to be allowed 
to make up assignments in certain 
cases (even if it means the student 
must provide some sort of proof, as 
hard as that may be).

We need to let students at the 

University know that we want to 
understand what they are going 
through and that they are not alone. 
Students’ suffering is exacerbated 
by the lack of University support 
with policies designed to show 
them they care. In fact, according 
to the Anxiety and Depression 
Association of America, “anxiety 
disorders are one of the most 
common mental health problems 
on college campuses,” so college 
administrators should be working 
even harder to help students during 
this time in their lives. Among these 
disorders, depression, for example, 
can render someone unable to go 
about his or her daily life with 
ease, including going to class. 
Students should rest assured they 
are understood, and do not have to 
panic that they are missing a pop 
quiz.

And like those who lose a family 

member, we need to let those who 
suffer from mental health problems 
know that we want to understand 
and we know that they are humans, 
incapable of being perfect. While 
changes 
like 
increasing 
CAPS 

funding are important, they won’t 
help change a campus climate the 
induces and exacerbates stress and 
anxiety if the University doesn’t 
send a clear message that it is 
here for the students. It’s time for 
the University to treat students 
like humans, not robots without 
feelings, 
uncontrollable 
adverse 

circumstances 
and 
immune 

systems that we can’t turn on 
and off. Life happens. So support 
students through it.

Let life happen
Google chose my fate
M

y freshman year was a blur 
and as it swiftly began 
coming to a close second 

semester. 
I 

realized 
I 

hadn’t focused 
my 
plans 
on 

anything other 
than 
going 

back to work at 
my 
hometown 

Subway for the 
summer. It was 
when I noticed 
an increasingly 
large number of my friends were 
about to embark on an adventure of 
a summer, either interning at a big 
company or studying abroad, that I 
decided my hometown Subway just 
wasn’t going to cut it. Since it was 
too late to apply for internships, I 
scrambled to find something that 
would take me away for a couple 
months.

The thought of working at a 

summer camp came to mind one 
night as I was scrolling through 
Netflix trying to find a movie to 
procrastinate doing my homework. 
One Google search for “Summer 
camps in northern Michigan” and 
three clicks later, I was filling out 
application after application. Most 
of the deadlines had passed, but 
I jumped at the ones that hadn’t. 
That night, I fell asleep not thinking 
anything would come of the dozen 
or so applications I filled out.

It was only a couple weeks later 

when I received an e-mail from the 
camp director of a camp in northern 
Michigan called “Camp Walden.” 
We set up a Skype interview, and 
a few days after that, I was sent a 
contract to be hired for nine weeks 
of my summer. I was excited but so 
far removed from what was to be 
expected of me as a counselor that 
the excitement was more of a dull 
ache in my abdomen.

Before last summer and my 

experience at Walden, I wasn’t a 
big believer in fate. Now, however, 
I’m a little more inclined to believe 
things really do happen for a reason. 
The majority of the counseling staff 
at Walden last summer were new. 

They had all done pretty much the 
same thing I did, which was Google 
summer camps in Michigan and go 
from there (at least the American 
staff did). The foreign staff had a 
much different experience finding 
Walden, but they found it all the 
same. I know it might sound hokey 
and the fact we all found the same 
camp can be placed on Google’s 
algorithms that pump out the 
same results when certain words 
are researched, but the group of 
people our camp directors found, 
hired and brought together last 
summer was so compatible and 
familial, I can’t think of any other 
way to explain how it felt being at 
camp.

It was a crazy job, but not at all 

how “Wet Hot American Summer” 
depicts summer camp. We all 
worked really hard to connect 
with our “kids” and make sure 
they had a fun time. Being at camp 
wasn’t a time for us counselors 
to socialize. We did, however, 
become insanely close in the seven 
days before campers arrived.

It’s unexplainable how fast 

relationships 
can 
form 
with 

complete strangers, but when 
you’re thrown into a situation 
with a relatively small group of 
people with whom you’re going 
to be eating, sleeping and working 
for 
two 
straight 
months, 
it 

becomes one of the easiest things 
you’ll ever do. I met some of my 
best friends working at that camp 
who I would have NEVER met 
otherwise. Fate became a frequent 
topic of conversation amongst 
us last summer. Had we all not 
chosen Walden, we wouldn’t have 
ever met each other.

We all still keep in touch even 

though we live in very different 
parts of the United States and the 
world — Savannah in Lansing, 
Sarah in Ohio and Matt in 
Scotland. Though we all live in 
different places, we will always 
have one very much in common, 
and that is Walden.

MUSIC REVIEW

‘Neighbors 2’ is 
comical but safe

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

I loved “Neighbors” when it burst 

onI loved “Neighbors” when it burst 
onto the scene two years ago. I saw 
it in a room 
full of college 
kids 
at 
the 

State 
Theatre 

who 
greeted 

each 
joke 

with 
raucous 

laughter. Maybe 
it 
was 
seeing 

“Neighbors 2” in 
a barren theater 
in the middle 
of a Saturday 
afternoon, but the film didn’t pack 
the same comedic punch as the 
first one. The movie takes a slightly 
different spin on the first film’s 
fraternity moving next door, but it 
only shines when it gives its talented 
cast something different than the 
first film.

“Neighbors 2” again follows Mac 

(Seth Rogen, “The Interview”) and 
Kelly (Rose Byrne, “Spy”) Radner, 
who, in this film, are in escrow on 
their house when a sorority moves in 
next door and a familiar war begins. 
The Radners and the sorority trade 
pranks, as the Radners push to get 
the sorority out before they mess 
with the sale of their house while 
the sorority pushes to party.

There’s 
a 
through 
line 
to 

“Neighbors 2” that’s quite smart, 
and it lies in how the film justifies 
a sorority moving in next door. 
Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz, “The 
5th Wave”) and her friends create 
Kappa Nu after finding a frat party 
disgustingly sexist and learning 
sororities aren’t allowed to throw 
parties on their own. Throughout 
the movie, they point out moments 
of sexism. For example, when Zac 
Efron’s (“High School Musical”) 
character, 
Teddy, 
says 
them 

throwing used tampons at the 
Radner’s house as a practical joke 
is disgusting, they point out the 
double standard by asking him 
“What would you say if it were a bag 
of dicks?” In addition, the climax 
of the film features a moment in 
which Teddy and Kelly convince 
the sorority girls to stand by its 
principles no matter what happens. 
I wish the film put a little more 

emphasis on this aspect because it’s 
what separated the comedy from 
“Neighbors.”

However, 
where 
“Neighbors” 

thrived was in its absurd, crass, 
crude and hysterical comedy, and 
“Neighbors 2” was able to bring some 
of that back. Each member of the 
ensemble — starting at the top with 
Rogen, Byrne, Efron and Moretz, 
supporting performances by Ike 
Barinholtz (“The Mindy Project’), 
Carla Gallo (“Men of a Certain Age”) 
and Dave Franco (“Now You See 
Me”), and going down to cameos 
by Hannibal Buress (“Why? with 
Hannibal Buress”), Lisa Kudrow 
(“Web 
Therapy”) 
and 
Kelsey 

Grammer (“Partners”) — brings 
something to the table. There’s 
an extended sequence that takes 
place at a football tailgate where 
the Radners are trying to stop the 
girls from selling weed and making 
enough money to keep their house. 
The sequence brings in a large group 
of the cast and is visually ambitious, 
as chase sequences move through 
crowds and across large distances. 
It also features Barinholtz dressed 
up as a clown, which is hysterically 
terrifying as he frequently pops up 
out of nowhere.

Though, 
“Neighbors 
2” 
had 

laughs, it faltered in its repetitiveness 
and close ties to the first film. Many 
of the jokes and situations felt oddly 
familiar, as the film followed a 
nearly identical story arc to the first 
one. There were parties, airbags 
and foul, gross-out jokes that felt 
too familiar. While it’s fun to see 
Rogen and Efron play the characters 
I enjoyed so much in the first film, 
the sequel didn’t do quite enough to 
differentiate the jokes they gave the 
characters in the first film (though 
Efron did get some leverage out of 
his arc, which focused on him failing 
to move on from college).

That’s really the sticking point 

behind “Neighbors 2.” If it wasn’t 
so tied to the first film’s arc, it could 
have fully embrace how a sorority 
makes it a different type of comedy 
and let its ensemble work with a 
more diverse set of material. Those 
aspects were the glimmers of hope 
I clung to in what was an otherwise 
disappointing movie that relied too 
strongly on the ideas of the first and 
without the same level of comedy to 
back it up.

Chance paints positive 
 

picture in deep ‘Book’

Rapper ventures into 

gospel territory in 

colorful album

By SHAYAN SHAFIIW

Daily Arts Writer

Before there were the likes 

of Common, Kanye West, Lupe 
Fiasco and Chance The Rapper, 
the South Side 
of Chicago was 
home to Black 
artist 
and 

activist Pastor 
T.L. 
Barrett. 

Barrett 
worked 
with 

the 
Chicago 

Youth 
Choir 

in 
1971 
to 

release “Like A Ship Without 
a Sail” — a gospel/soul classic 
that 
encapsulated 
an 
intense 

commitment to revitalizing the 
South Side and keeping kids off 
the streets. Over 40 years later, 
Barrett’s 
work 
continues 
to 

influence the various artists and 
activists coming out of Chicago 
today. While it seems much of 
the music coming out of the city 
aims to burn Chicago to the 
ground, artists like Chance The 
Rapper and Kanye West have 
recently 
undergone 
noticeable 

shifts towards a more religiously-
charged sound, channeling the 
influences of their faith and 
relationship with a higher power 
as vehicles of betterment for their 
communities.

Like 
Kanye’s 
The 
Life 
of 

Pablo, Chance’s Coloring Book 
is 
arguably 
an 
unorthodox 

“gospel album,” yet its message 
is 
accessible 
regardless 
of 

personal 
denomination. 
The 

album is an exaltation of the 
simpler 
things: 
“Don’t 
forget 

the happy thoughts.” Though 
much of Coloring Book feels like 
“Ultralight Beam: The Album,” 
the 
project 
is 
unmistakably 

Chance’s; his fingerprints are all 
over the details of each song, like 
the perfectly arranged trumpet 
harmonies and trademark ad libs. 
Choir vocals, belting in unison, are 
a fixed presence throughout, and 
both ‘Ye and Kirk Franklin make 

their respective appearances.

The intro, “All We Got,” has 

both 
shades 
of 
early-2000s 

backpack-rap and elements of 
soul, blended with muffled Kanye 
vocals and synths. This time, 
Chance doesn’t have to cede 
the limelight, and he uses the 
opportunity to spread those nice, 
warm, fuzzy feelings. It’s the type 
of unfiltered ecstasy that can’t 
be faked; you hear it when the 
horns kick in and his vocals go up 
a register: “Man I swear my life 
is perfect, I could merch it / If I 
died I’d probably cry at my own 
service!” The song closes out with 
backing vocals from the Chicago 
Youth Choir, essentially picking 
up where Pastor Barrett left off. 
This is music for the kids who 
need it most.

The video for “Angels” features 

Chance literally flying around 
Chicago like a superhero, “cleaning 
up the streets” so his “daughter 
can have a place to play.” I imagine 
this is what it would have looked 
like if Barrett had Internet access 
in 1971. The birth of Chance’s 
daughter seems to have triggered 
a certain maturity and level-
headedness that allows him to be 
a representative of his community 
— the type of “famous rapper” 
that brags about having the same 
phone 
number 
since 
seventh 

grade. He shows a shocking 
amount of self-awareness, even 
“threatening” to make music with 
Chief Keef. He’s comfortably the 
biggest independent artist in hip 
hop right now. He can do what he 
wants.

Part of what makes Coloring 

Book such a special album is it’s 
exactly what Chance intended 
to make; there are no gimmicky 
Drake 
features 
or 
product 

placements. 
As 
the 
music 

industry (and specifically hip-
hop culture) become increasingly 
corporate and gentrified, songs 
like 
“No 
Problem” 
celebrate 

the possibilities of authentic, 
independent music: “If one more 
label try to stop me, it’s gon be 
some dreadhead n****s in ya 
lobby.” 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne 
also make notable appearances 
on the back of their Collegrove 
collaboration. Tity Boi delivers 
his inevitably hilarious verse, 

channeling the Most High by 
being just plain high (“Man I’m so 
high, me and God dappin”). The 
whole song is driven by frenzied 
gospel samples, sliced and mixed 
unpredictably 
without 
ever 

settling in place.

Chance has a knack for weaving 

between heavy and playful topics, 
and this is what makes him more 
of an MC than a pastor. Earlier 
this year, he signed a petition to 
have free music considered for the 
Grammys, and on Coloring Book 
he’s dedicated an entire track to 
mixtapes: a sacred, and — more 
importantly — free outlet for 
listening to some genre-defining 
projects. This one’s for the fans 
who have ruined perfectly good 
computers by digging too deep on 
Datpiff. Mixtape-god Young Thug 
and fellow Atlanta weirdo Lil 
Yachty trade verses, while Chance 
showcases his lyrical dexterity 
with a surprising triplet flow. 
“Mixtape” and other album cuts 
like “All Night” are nice breaks 
from the intermittent sermons, 
showing Chance can make “hits” 
when he feels like it.

Much of the early dialogue 

surrounding the album has been 
characterized by a disdain for the 
religious cuts and an adoration 
of the more accessible tracks. 
Most hip-hop heads probably 
scoffed when they saw the track 
title “Blessings” was important 
enough to appear twice on the 
same album; I can only imagine 
how many eyes rolled when “How 
Great” kicked off with 3 straight 
minutes of isolated choir vocals.

It feels like the profession of 

being an artist can be reduced 
to letting the world in on your 
personal 
development. 
Some 

overcome their adversities and 
impart 
elation 
onto 
listeners 

through music, and others let us 
wallow with them in the misery 
of defeat. It doesn’t matter if you 
attribute the peaks and troughs of 
your life to a higher power, your 
own series of calculated decisions 
or plain old luck. If music is to 
be our soundtrack, through its 
ups and downs, Coloring Book 
is a reminder that shit is going 
to be alright, regardless of your 
personal belief system. Isn’t that 
something we’d all like to believe

Ariana Grande steps up 
her game on ‘Dangerous’

MUSIC REVIEW

Artist breaks the 
scene with soulful 

album

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

In the past few months, female-

driven pop has been on a winning 
streak. While there were a few 
duds 
(like 

Meghan 
Trainor’s dull 
sophomore 
record Thank 
You), 
2016 

has 
been 

graced 
with 

the 
presence 

of 
several 

pop 
gems 

from female artists. Australian 
songstress 
Sia 
continued 
her 

burgeoning notoriety with the 
powerful This is Acting while 
Gwen Stefani returned to the 
music scene with her impressive 
comeback This is What the Truth 
Feels 
Like. 
The 
two 
biggest 

surprises of this year in music 
came from Rihanna and Beyoncé, 
both of whom released records 
without much public warning: 
the 
jarringly 
inventive 
Anti 

and the politically conscious, 
deeply personal and all-around 
fantastic visual album Lemonade, 
respectively. That being said, 
there’s one artist who also seems 
to stand out from the pack: 
22-year-old actress/singer Ariana 
Grande.

After her role as the naive 

redhead Cat on the kids show 
Victorious, Grande made her way 
toward the top of the music ranks 
with her sweet 2013 debut Yours 
Truly, subsequently establishing 
her place in pop with 2014’s 
stunning My Everything. Now, 
with her third record Dangerous 
Woman, Grande further sheds 
her innocent Nickelodeon child 
star image by evolving into a 
sophisticated, 
mature 
modern 

woman, ready to sink her teeth 
into newer, more daring material. 
 
 
 

Like My Everything, Dangerous 

Woman 
explores 
female 

empowerment 
and 
unrequited 

love through glossy production, 

catchy 
lyrics 
and 
Grande’s 

signature glass-shattering vocals. 
But instead of simply rehashing 
My Everything’s boldness, Grande 
pushes 
Dangerous 
Woman 
to 

edgier 
thematic 
and 
musical 

territory, in which the singer 
boasts a more feminist message 
about 
how 
women 
who 
are 

deemed “dangerous” are unafraid 
to speak the truth, especially when 
it comes to power, independence 
and sexuality. This unapologetic 
energy, coupled with Grande’s 
glowing ambition, is what makes 
Dangerous Woman a thrilling 
example of the many directions 
pop music is taking in 2016. 

The 
11-song 
album, 
which 

includes 
four 
bonus 
tracks, 

experiments 
with 
different 

genres, such as R&B on the 
bouncy 
‘90s 
throwback 
“Be 

Alright,” trap on the glittery, 
Future-featuring 
“Everyday” 

and reggae on the groovy, Nicki 
Minaj-assisted “Side to Side.” 
In addition to using beats from 
previous 
Grande 
collaborators 

Tommy 
Brown 
(“Honeymoon 

Avenue”), 
Ilya 
Salmanzadeh 

(“Problem”) and Kid Ink producer 
Twice as Nice, Dangerous Woman 
works well thanks to Swedish 
pop maestro Max Martin, who 
provides the album with his hit-
making magic touch, both in its 
songwriting and sound. He layers 
Dangerous Woman’s instrumental 
skeleton with lush guitar riffs on 
the indelible title track, throbbing 
electro-heavy synths on the sultry 
club banger “Into You” and head-
bopping horns on the record’s best 
song “Greedy.”

Though 
many 
songs 
off 

Dangerous 
Woman 
reach 

moments of profundity, there are 
some elements that bring them 
down a tad. The lullaby opener 
“Moonlight” (the alleged original 
title of the album) harkens back 

to Grande’s tween pop roots with 
its twinkly strings and breathy 
harmonies. 
But 
the 
track’s 

romantic, gooey core gives it a 
sentimental, 
borderline-cheesy 

appeal. The gorgeous, low-key 
hip-hop jingle “Let Me Love 
You” opens with a devastating 
line about post-breakup anxiety 
(“I just broke up with my ex / 
Now that I’m single, I don’t really 
know what’s next”) and continues 
with a slow, sexy and stuttering 
rhythm, until the song halts when 
an 
unnecessary 
feature 
from 

Lil Wayne pops up. Penultimate 
song “Sometimes” is so-so in 
its execution, with its acoustic 
undertones giving the track a 
bland sound.

Fortunately, those are minor 

issues given Grande’s musical 
prowess. While My Everything 
touched 
on 
cutesy 
double 

entendres and subtle suggestive 
references, 
Grande 
is 
much 

more explicit about her sexual 
conquests 
and 
self-image 
on 

Dangerous Woman, even drawing 
some parallels to In The Zone-era 
Britney Spears. The title song can 
be interpreted as both a confident 
girl-power anthem and a song 
about pegging (“Taking control of 
this kind of moment / I’m locked 
and loaded / Completely focused, 
my mind is open”). On bonus track 
“Bad Decisions,” Grande asks 
cheekily, “Ain’t you ever seen a 
princess be a bad bitch?”

Dangerous Woman could have 

simply been churned from the 
standardized conveyor belt of pop 
as another formulaic album. Yet 
Grande understands very clearly 
how to structure her craft that 
heeds to her audience’s desires 
while 
maintaining 
her 
own 

artistic integrity. Each track feels 
wholesome and complete, not 
only because of the spectacular 
production or Grande’s formidable 
vocal range, but also because of 
the ideas conveyed in each song. 
It’s not necessarily a thought-
provoking or compelling album, 
but Dangerous Woman showcases 
Grande’s 
ability 
to 
shape 
a 

listener’s understanding of the 
importance of a woman’s choice 
to sing, dance and speak without 
being undermined by critics and 
sexist trolls.

‘Grey’s’ matures

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Why mess with a good thing? As 

the twelfth season of “Grey’s Anat-
omy” comes to a close, it’s clear the 
doctors of Grey-Sloan Memorial 
Hospital 
are 

here to stay 
for the long 
haul. The sea-
son finale was 
more subdued 
than 
those 

that 
came 

before it, lack-
ing the dra-
matic punches 
that 
Shonda 

Rhimes, 
the 

series’ creator, delivers oh-so-well. 
But, perhaps, the episode called 
“Family Affair” is the beginning of 
a Renaissance within the “Grey’s” 
world, one that has been bloom-
ing throughout the twelfth season. 
More nuanced and mature, the 
show has entered a new era.

Going back 10 years, Meredith 

Grey (Ellen Pompeo, “Daredevil”) 
was still rocking the early-2000s 
side bangs and sneaking around 
with McDreamy in on-call rooms 
and the show felt as young and 
perky as its interns. The episodic 
structure split up its time between 
medicine and the characters’ dra-
matic personal lives, with surgery 
centered at the core of the series. 
The medicine was teaching the 
naive interns about surgery just 
as much as it was guiding them 
through their own problems. The 
two were never separate.

But that was over a decade ago, 

and the interns that have made it 
to the present day are big-shot sur-
geons with “grown-up” problems. 
As the series has taken the time to 
explore storylines following the 
death of a spouse, custody battles 
and personal addiction, the medi-
cine has fallen to the background. 
But maybe that’s ok, because the 
new “Grey’s” is able to develop the 

characters, using surgery as a tool 
to grow into themselves as people 
rather than just doctors.

The finale seamlessly set up 

this transition into the next sea-
son as the doctors left the hospi-
tal’s grounds for the majority of 
the episode. Even the big, edge-
of-your-seat medical emergency 
happened on Meredith’s living 
room table (because when has 
there ever been a baby delivery on 
“Grey’s Anatomy” that has gone 
smoothly?). These characters have 
gone through everything together, 
and the time has come to delve into 
their relationships and provide 
answers that are essential to the 
show’s future. In a more-optimis-
tic-than-usual season finale, the 
series left the audience with one 
looming question that needs to be 
answered in the stories to come: 
Can you have more than one great 
love?

Perhaps the biggest disappoint-

ment of season 12’s conclusion is 
the announcement of Callie Tor-
res’ (Sara Ramirez, “Spiderman”) 
break from the show. Although 
both Ramirez and Rhimes left the 
door open for the veteran “Grey’s” 
to return, her absence will be a sig-
nificant loss to the show. As many 
of the original cast members have 
dwindled away from the series in 
the past years, Callie Torres has 
grown into a central and complex 
character that has brought many 
issues, both within the show’s sto-
rylines and in the Shondaland mis-
sion to normalize television, into 
the conversation. Her role as a Lati-
na, homosexual female surgeon 
has brought depth and diversity to 
“Grey’s” that will be sorely missed.

Yet even as characters have 

come and gone, the Shondaland 
original has proven its viewers are 
not ready to part with the decade-
long series. With steady ratings and 
a Thursday night spot in television 
real-estate gold, “Grey’s Anatomy” 
is ready to tackle season 13 without 
slowing down.

New nursing 
dean plans for
intersectional
new practices 

ACADEMICS

First appointee in 
10 years draws on 
multidisciplinary 
work experiences

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

School of Nursing will welcome 
a new dean for the first time in 
10 years following the Board of 
Regents’ appointment of Patricia 
Hurn last Thursday. Hurn will 
replace Kathleen Potempa — who 
will remain at the University to 
focus on research and training 
of postdoctoral fellows — as she 
takes on the five-year position as 
dean August 1. 

Hurn is currently the vice 

chancellor 
for 
research 
and 

innovation at the University of 
Texas System and a research 
professor of neurobiology at the 
University of Texas at Austin. She 
received her Bachelor of Science 
in nursing from the University 
of 
Florida, 
her 
master’s 
in 

nursing from the University of 
Washington and her Ph.D. in 
physiology from Johns Hopkins 
University.

Hurn 
said 
her 

multidisciplinary 
background 

will be strongly featured during 
her tenure at the University.

“I don’t belong to just one 

discipline,” Hurn said. “I started 
my career as a nurse, but I’ve 
been trained as a physiologist and 
a neuroscientist, and I’ve spent 
a lot of years just in research 
working 
with 
many, 
many 

disciplines. Since that’s how I 
learned and was educated, that’s 
what I will bring to my work as 
dean.”

Hurn, who said she was 

attracted to the University’s 
dedication 
to 
research, 
has 

previous ties to Michigan; she 
was born in the state and was also 
previously a visiting professor at 
the University. Hurn said she was 
ready to return to campus life

NEWS

after working as an administrator 
for several years, adding that the 
opening of a dean position in Ann 
Arbor could not have arrived at a 
more opportune moment for her.

“When the opportunity came 

up, what I thought was … the 
University of Michigan — it doesn’t 

get any better than that place,” 
she said. “(The University) is a 
marvelous school and I think that 
the students and faculty there have, 
from what I see, some real bonds 
that are extremely attractive, and 
I look forward to adding to those.”

Since she worked as a practicing 

nurse before entering academia, 
Hurn said her drive to research 
stems 
from 
her 
interactions 

with patients. She said that, as a 

young nurse, she was consistenly 
frustrated with the lack of means 
to help head injury and trauma 
patients — groups with high 
mortality rates. 

“We didn’t really have the 

knowledge to be able to save 
those people,” Hurn said. “And 
it wasn’t that I, the nurse, didn’t 

the human angle of undocumented 
immigrants through the image of 
normal families being torn apart 
through such actions.

“What kind of country would we 

be if we let Donald Trump rip our 
families apart?” Clinton asked.

Clinton 
additionally 
brought 

attention to the issue of minimum 
wage, reaffirming her support 
for raising the number to $15 per 
hour, which has been a point of 
contention between Clinton and 
her rival in the Democratic contest, 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.). Unlike 
Sanders, Clinton initially favored a 
$12 minimum wage.

During a debate in April, Clinton 

amended her stance, stating she 
would sign a federal $15 minimum 
wage bill if it appeared before her as 
president, to which Sanders reacted 
with surprise.

Clinton hammered Trump for 

his statements suggesting that 
minimum wage be abolished — 
which he has recently rebutted 
— and Trump’s economic policies 
in general, saying they would 
be a disaster for working-class 
Americans.

“We aren’t talking about any 

ordinary anti-union, anti-worker 
Republican,” 
she 
said. 
“Many 

Republicans 
themselves 
say 

Donald Trump is a disaster waiting 
to happen. What little we know 
of his economic policies would be 
running up our debt, starting trade 
wars, letting Wall Street run wild 
— all of that would cause another 
crash 
and 
devastate 
working 

families and our country.”

Despite this shift in focus to the 

general election, Clinton departed 
Detroit for California, where she 
will hold events in preparation for 
the state’s June 7 primary.

Clinton did offer a short mention 

of Sanders, however, calling for him 
to unify the party, repeating that 
she and Sanders shared positions 
on many key issues including 
minimum wage and campaign 
finance reform.

“I applaud Sen. Sanders and his 

supporters for challenging us,” she 
said. “(But) we are going to unify 
the Democratic party and stop 
Donald Trump.”

The 
majority 
of 
Clinton’s 

remarks appeared to be appealing 
to the thousands of SEIU workers 
and representatives in attendance, 
including her support for child care 
reform and increased accessibility. 

“You know that in many states 

child care is more expensive than 

rent — it’s more expensive even 
than college tuition,” Clinton said. 
“That puts parents in an impossible 
position.”

According to Clinton, in some 

states two minimum-wage-earning 
parents must spend roughly 20 
percent of their income on childcare 
and single parents must allocate 40 
percent.

“That 
is 
way 
too 
high,” 

Clinton said, challenging those in 
attendance to join her in pushing 
for child care reform that lowers 
its financial burden, ideally tapping 
into no more than 10 percent of a 
parent’s wage.

Clinton additionally affirmed 

her support for an increase in pay 
for child care providers and early 
educators on a state and local level, 
noting that many SEIU members 
in the audience must sacrifice the 
care of their own children to work 
for others in need of care, such as 
home health aides and hospital 
employees.

“This is crazy,” Clinton said. 

“There’s nothing more important 
than our children, and when I 
sat down with SEIU members in 
Chicago I heard one heartbreaking 
story after another from parents 
who can’t afford to give their own 
children the care that they give 
other people’s kids every day.”

and public input processes when 
undertaking 
new 
construction 

because its status as a state entity. 

Hank Baier, the University’s 

associate vice president for facilities 
and operations, said in a press release 
that the University made a mistake 
by not soliciting community input 
earlier in the project, but remained 
hopeful for the construction of a 
similar facility in the future.

“The project development team 

understands the importance of 
community engagement in selecting 
sites for University activities,” Baier 
said. “In this case, we should have 
sought input from our neighbors 
earlier in the development process. 
Going forward, this will be our 
practice as we consider uses for this 
site as well as others.” 

The 
decision 
to 
cancel 

construction came as a surprise 
to local residents, who showed 
up to a meeting with University 
representatives 
on 
Tuesday 

evening expecting to learn about 
the 
expected 
environmental 

impacts of the planned facility. 
Instead, University representatives 
presented the residents with a press 
release announcing the cancellation 
of the project.

Jim Kosteva, University director 

of community relations, said the 

ultimate decision to cancel the 
project was made by University 
President Mark Schlissel and the 
team managing the project earlier 
this week.

Local residents have reacted 

positively to the decision to cancel 
construction, and many residents 
feel this will represent broader shift 
in how the University interacts 
with city residents. Sandy Aldrich, 
co-president of the Northeast Ann 
Arbor Community Coalition, said 
the University likely would not have 
been as receptive to community 
concerns before Schlissel became 
president.

“After 
speaking 
with 
many 

longtime 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents, 

they have indicated that, had this 
happened 
before 
(Schlissel’s) 

administration, that we would have 
gotten a much different response,” 
Aldrich said. “I do truly believe 
that President Schlissel is sincere in 
bringing a sense of partnership and 
openness to the University when 
dealing with the community.”

Aldrich also reaffirmed that, 

despite their efforts to protest the 
project, most city residents remain 
favorable of the University, as many 
of them are employees and graduates 
of it.

“By no means are we anti-

University,” Aldrich said. “Because 
it helps the city as well when the 
University becomes greater and 
better.”

Big Ten Tournament preview

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan baseball team’s 

season took a turn for the worst after 
it lost seven of its last eight regular-
season games, five of which were 
against Big Ten foes.

But if the Wolverines (14-10 

Big Ten, 35-19 overall) learned 
anything from last season’s Big Ten 
Tournament championship run, it 
was that this tourney will give them 
the opportunity to start with a clean 
slate and battle for a spot at an NCAA 
Regional.

Here’s what to watch for as 

Michigan prepares for the Big Ten 
Tournament.

1. Everyone in the lineup except 

Jake Bivens ...

The sophomore third basemen is 

the only player in the Wolverines’ 
batting order who hasn’t shifted 
from his spot in the lineup. In 207 
at-bats, the leadoff hitter leads the 
team with 75 hits and a .362 batting 
average.

With Michigan hampered by 

injuries, including a broken arm 
for left fielder Matt Ramsay and a 
concussion for utility player Carmen 
Benedetti, Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich has been forced to rely on 
bench players such as Johnny Slater 
and Jonathan Engelmann to pick up 
slack in the outfield and at the plate.

The emergence of players like 

fifth-year senior Dominic Jamett 
has also resulted in several changes 
to the lineup amidst the Wolverines’ 
struggles. The order that Bakich will 
use against the Buckeyes will likely 
be the same throughout the Big Ten 

Tournament.

2. ... especially junior catcher 

Harrison Wenson

Wenson, 
Michigan’s 
most 

prolific power-hitter, has endured 
an uncharacteristic slump in the 
Wolverines’ season-ending skid. In 
the past eight games, he is just 3-for-
32 — the only bright spot is two home 
runs in that span.

His lackluster performance has 

relegated him to as low as No. 7 in 
the batting order in some contests as 
opposed to his typical residency in 
the cleanup spot.

If Michigan hopes to repeat as 

the Big Ten Tournament champion, 
it must be able to get its consistent 
hitting back from its usual suspects 
rather than rely on the pitching staff 
or any outlying play from the bottom 
of the lineup.

3. Middle-inning relievers
Despite 
a 
few 
hiccups, 
the 

Wolverines’ starting pitchers have 
been getting the job done, boasting a 
3.76 earned-run average and striking 
out nine batters a game, good for 14th 
in the country.

The same cannot be said about the 

middle-inning relievers. In almost 
every one of its last eight games, 

Michigan’s bullpen has given up at 
least one run without fail. Against 
Illinois on May 20, all four Wolverine 
relievers allowed at least one run, 
tallying nine total to blow a 7-2 lead.

No part of the Wolverine squad 

has played without mistakes, but 
when the starting pitching or the 
offense gets going, it’s not being 
backed up in tight contests. Michigan 
must be able to maintain late leads — 
something that has been a season-
long struggle — if it hopes to advance 
in the tourney.

4. The rest of the Big Ten
Before 
the 
season 
began, 

Michigan was widely projected as 
the frontrunner to win the Big Ten. 
Though the Wolverines are coming 
into the tournament with a better 
record than last season, they finished 
a disappointing fifth place in the 
conference standings, a decline 
from being a No. 3 seed in the 2015 
tournament.

Yes, Michigan has improved upon 

last year’s Big Ten Tournament 
championship team, but so has 
the rest of the Big Ten — by a lot. 
Minnesota’s 
batting 
average 
of 

.326 ranks fourth in the country, 
Michigan State’s 2.71 ERA is also 
good for fourth and Ohio State, 
which the Wolverines will be 
facing Wednesday, has the nation’s 
11th-best ERA.

Even if the Wolverines can get 

past the Buckeyes, who they were 
swept by earlier this season, the 
tournament won’t get any easier 
for Michigan. The Wolverines must 
improve in all facets of the game to 
repeat what they accomplished in 
last year’s miraculous run.

The Michigan baseball team has been mired in a slump recently, losing seven of its last eight games.

‘M’ loses in Elite 
Eight to Stanford

Michigan’s season 
ended after its loss 

to the Cardinal.

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY

Daily Sports Writer

No player would want to be in 

the position that Kate Fahey was in 
Saturday during the quarterfinals 
of the NCAA Tournament.

The freshman was in a third 

set tiebreaker that would not only 
decide who won her match, but 
decide if her team’s season would 
continue. 

Though Fahey and the No. 11 

Michigan women’s tennis team 

nearly pulled off a comeback win, 
No. 12 Stanford proved to be too 
much for the Wolverines, and 
Michigan’s season ended with a 
4-3 loss.

Fahey’s 
match 
didn’t 
start 

as close as it ended. Stanford’s 
Caroline Doyle dominated Fahey 
in the first set, but Fahey refused to 
go down without a fight. She easily 

won the second set and leveled the 
playing field once again.

Neither opponent showed any 

sign of slowing down, forcing the 
third set into a tiebreaker. Doyle 
immediately jumped out to a 5-0 
lead, and Fahey was unable to close 
the deficit. After a long rally during 
match point, she hit her ball into 
the net and lost the tiebreaker, 7-4, 
and the match, 2-6, 6-2, 6-7.

Michigan got off to a quick start, 

winning two out of three doubles 
matches. Sophomore Mira Ruder-
Hook and freshman Brienne Minor 
clinched the doubles point for the 
Wolverines, giving Michigan an 
early 1-0 lead. The No. 1 doubles 
pair won, 7-5, after four straight 
double faults from Stanford.

Then, a win from senior Ronit 

Yurovsky and losses from both 
sophomore Alex Najarian and 
freshman Teona Velehorschi tied 
the match at 2-2.

Ruder-Hook, Fahey and Minor 

all forced their matches to third 
sets and things were finally looking 
up for Michigan. Just two of them 
needed to win for the Wolverines 
to advance.

A win from Minor and loss from 

Ruder-Hook shined the spotlight 
on Fahey, who couldn’t pull off the 
comeback.

“I’m really proud of our team 

and the year we’ve had,” said 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein. 
“We made it to the Elite 8 and 
having a chance to go to the Final 
Four was exciting, but it just

Betsa rebounds at 
NCAA Regionals

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 

sat down with Megan Betsa shortly 
after the No. 2 Michigan softball 
team’s 4-3 loss to No. 15 Minnesota 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 

championship.

The junior right-hander had 

battled through nine innings against 
the Golden Gophers, issuing eight 
walks but giving up just three 
hits and two earned runs with 10 
strikeouts.

The conversation between coach 

and player was simple: Hutchins 
wanted to remind her star pitcher of 
her own prowess.

“(Hutchins) and I had a good talk,” 

Betsa said. “She just told me that I 
need to start trusting myself, that 
what I do is good enough. Sometimes 
I get myself in trouble just thinking 
too much and worrying about the 
hitter, as opposed to just throwing 
my pitches through the zone. I think 
her giving me that reminder, it was 
a good time going into postseason 
to know that what I’m doing is good 
enough.”

In addition to heeding her coach’s 

advice, Betsa also spent the week 
leading up to the NCAA Tournament 
practicing on her control with a 
special drill designed by pitching 
coach Jennifer Brundage.

“We shrunk the strike zone this 

week in practice with strings,” 
Betsa said after Saturday’s victory. 
“My job was still to throw the ball 
through the strike zone and not let 
my emotions get the best of me.”

The combination of Hutchins’ 

moral 
support 
and 
Brundage’s 

drill clearly paid off. Betsa started 
all three games of the Wolverines’ 
NCAA Regional this past weekend 
and was integral to her team’s 
success in each of them, pitching two 
shutouts and giving up just two runs 
all weekend.

Friday against Valparaiso, Betsa 

put to rest any concerns about her 
control, issuing only one walk en 
route to a one-hit, nine-strikeout 
performance. After the game against 
the Crusaders, Betsa commented 
that she was particularly pleased 
with the movement on her curveball 
and riseball.

And though she thought her 

curveball was not as good in 

Saturday’s game against Miami 
(Ohio), Betsa was just as effective as 
she was the day before — the junior 
threw another one-hit shutout, this 
time with no walks.

The toughest challenge for the 

junior all weekend came against No. 
23 Notre Dame.

In the fourth inning of Sunday’s 

matchup against the Fighting Irish, 
Hutchins paid a visit to the circle 
with the Wolverines clinging to a 
one-run lead. Betsa had allowed a 
leadoff single before Notre Dame 
sacrificed the runner over to second, 
and Hutchins wanted to talk things 
over.

Just like her conversation with 

Betsa after the Minnesota game, this 
chat paid off as well.

“She just came out there to tell 

me my body speed looked slow,” 
Betsa said. “I wasn’t whipping my 
pitches, and that tends to be when I 
get into trouble: when I try to place 
the ball and my body speed slows 
down. So she just told me to whip it, 
spin the ball through the zone and I 
got the result that she wanted and I 
wanted.”

That result was two consecutive 

strikeouts to get out of the inning 
with Michigan’s lead preserved, and 
the Wolverines would plate five runs 
in the next half inning to put the 
game out of reach.

“What I have loved the most 

about Megan is when she has ups 
and downs — in particular when she 
has downs — she really works hard 
to get through them,” Hutchins said. 
“She’s coachable, she’s approachable 
and she’ll do anything to be great.”

Added Betsa: “I like where I am 

right now. I struggled early on in the 
season because I felt like I was trying 
to play catch-up the first month of 
the season from not being able to 
pitch — I was dealing with a little 
back injury, and after I came off that, 
I was like, ‘Well, I need to be where 
I was a month ago right now.’ When 
I wasn’t there, I was just getting 
frustrated, and it was just a vicious 
cycle. Once I learned to let go of that 
and realizing that I was good enough 
where I was in the current moment, 
I started to be myself again.”

And if Betsa being herself means 

posting a 0.82 earned-run average 
over 17 innings pitched against three 
NCAA Tournament teams, then her 
team appears to be in good shape.

NCAA Super Regionals Preview

Daily Sports Writer

In Megan Betsa’s last start against 

then-No. 18 Missouri on March 3, 
she pitched a shutout and struck out 
seven batters in the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team’s 13-0 run-rule victory. 
The junior right-hander walked four 
batters and threw just 60 percent of 
her pitches for strikes.

Last weekend, Betsa won all 

three of her starts to lead the 
Wolverines to an NCAA Regional 
sweep. She walked only one batter 
in 17 innings and allowed just two 
runs. After a gritty, but at times 
erratic, performance in the Big Ten 
Tournament, Betsa’s three starts 
last weekend solidified her place as 
the conference’s best pitcher.

Michigan (21-2 Big Ten, 49-5 

overall) will play a No. 16 Missouri 
squad that rolled through its 
regional, becoming the first team to 
clinch a spot in the Super Regionals. 
The Tigers (14-10 Southeastern, 
42-14 overall) didn’t allow a run in 
its three run-rule victories.

“I can tell you this: (Missouri’s) 

a really good team,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “I do know 
that the day we played them was the 
day after their star pitcher was hit in 
the face with a ball, and they were 
down and out. We are not playing 
that team — that team is gone. 
They’re a very good team, and I can 
only say that there are no bad teams 
to play.”

The key component of Missouri’s 

offense is its impressive speed on 
the basepaths. The Tigers have 

stolen 163 bases, averaging 2.91 per 
game, good for second in the nation. 
Leading the team is outfielder Taylor 
Gadbois with 54 steals, highest in 
the Southeastern Conference and 
second in the country. Gadbois 
sports a .401 batting average, one of 
three Missouri hitters with a .401 
clip or greater.

The Wolverines’ catchers will 

be facing a daunting task against a 
speedy Tigers squad. Sophomore 
Aidan Falk and freshman Alex 
Sobczack have caught just four 
runners stealing this season. In this 
weekend’s games against Missouri, 
Falk will certainly be tested behind 
the plate.

In the circle, Missouri right-

hander Paige Lowary garnered 
three complete-game shutouts in 
the regional and looks to replicate 
similar results against Michigan. 
Lowary struggled in her previous 
appearance against the Wolverines, 
walking 
seven 
batters 
and 

allowing 11 runs in three innings. 
Lowary pitched all 17 innings in 
last weekend’s regional. Helping 
Lowary in the rotation is right-

hander Danielle Baumgartner, who 
holds a 1.98 earned-run average 
despite striking out just 53 batters in 
109.1 innings.

Michigan 
rebounded 
from 

a difficult loss in the Big Ten 
Tournament final to dominate its 
three regional games. It outscored 
its opponents 20-2. Senior second 
baseman Sierra Romero — recently 
named a top-three finalist for 
USA Softball Player of the Year 
— notched two home runs and 
four RBI in last weekend’s games, 
and she is on pace to break her 
single-season home run and RBI 
records of 23 and 83, respectively. 
The Wolverines offense has been 
overwhelming all season, ranking 
third with a .353 batting average 
and scoring 8.31 runs per game, tied 
for first nationally.

Senior 
centerfielder 
Sierra 

Lawrence continues to jumpstart 
the offense for Michigan, stealing 
20 bases from the lead-off spot in 
the lineup and ranks second on 
the team in on-base percentage at 
.560. Lawrence is slugging a career-
best .703 and made her second 
consecutive All-Great Lakes Region 
first team.

The Wolverines’ offense has 

rarely been a cause for concern, so all 
eyes will turn to Michigan’s pitching 
staff. If Betsa and fifth-year senior 
right-hander Sara Driesenga can 
take care of the Tigers’ hitters, the 
Wolverines’ catchers won’t need to 
worry about Missouri’s aggressive 
baserunners. If that’s the case, 
Michigan could win another trip to 
the Women’s College World Series.

Christner rediscovers form at NCAA Regionals

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

As a first team All-American 

last 
year, 
junior 
left 
fielder 

Kelly Christner has struggled 

to duplicate that same offensive 
prowess this season.

But if her performance in the 

NCAA Regional is any indication, 
Christner is in the midst of an 
offensive 
resurgence, 
and 
her 

timing couldn’t be better for the 
No. 2 Michigan softball team.

Batting .500 with three runs, two 

doubles and an RBI last weekend 
in three consecutive wins over 
Valparaiso, Miami (Ohio) and No. 

23 Notre Dame, Christner played 
a large role for the Wolverines, 
who earned the regional crown 
and advanced to the NCAA Super 
Regionals.

While 
Michigan 
outscored 

its trio of opponents, 20-2, the 
Wolverines sometimes found it 
difficult to generate momentum 
at the plate. By utilizing inventive 
ways to reach base at key moments, 
Christner proved to be critical to 
her team’s success.

Saturday against Miami (Ohio), 

Michigan had failed to record a 
hit through the first three innings 
against Redhawk pitcher Amber 
Logemann. But that all changed 
when Christner stepped into the 
batter’s box to lead off the fourth.

Hoping to provide a spark for her 

troubled team, Christner took an 
unorthodox approach to the at-bat. 
Relying on her keen instincts — 
supplemented by direction from 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
— Christner took the first pitch 
Logemann threw and gently placed 
it in front of her before taking off 
for first base. Her shrewd move 
caught the Redhawks off guard and 
allowed her to reach base safely 
for the Wolverines’ first hit of the 
game — off a bunt single no less.

“If I was a gambling person, 

which I’m not, I would’ve bet that 
(Christner) would have bunted on 
that pitch,” Hutchins said. “But I 
also wanted to remind her.”

Just as Christner had hoped, the 

hit paid dividends for Michigan. 
The Wolverines turned her leadoff 
hit into a two-run frame that swung 
the momentum in their favor. And 
if that wasn’t enough, Christner 
launched a full-count RBI double 
to left field to cap off a four-run 
sixth that solidified Michigan’s 6-0 
victory.

Sunday against Notre Dame in 

the regional final, the Wolverines 
were clinging to a 2-1 lead after 
four innings of play, once again 
unable 
to 
manufacture 
much 

offense. But after senior second 
baseman Sierra Romero reached 
base on a throwing error and 
advanced to second on a wild pitch, 
Christner stepped up to the plate 
with another opportunity to propel 
her team forward.

Banking on the success of her 

bunt single attempt the day before, 
Christner decided to try the same 
trick 
again. 
Leaning 
forward 

with her bat on the second pitch, 
Christner planted the ball directly 
in front of her before dashing 

toward first base. The Fighting 
Irish were left just as confounded 
as the Redhawks, unable to react 
in time to stop Christner from 
reaching base safely. 

For the second straight game, 

Christner’s skillful play benefited 
Michigan immensely. This time, 
the Wolverines capitalized on 
the two-on, no-out scenario by 
constructing a four-run frame 
that ultimately decided the game, 
as Michigan went on to earn a 6-2 
victory.

Throughout 
the 
season, 

Hutchins has attempted to help 
Christner combat her struggles 
at the plate, moving her from the 
top to the bottom of the batting 
order at various times in an effort 
to jumpstart her hitting. In the 
NCAA Regional, Christner found 
success at both the No. 6 spot and 
No. 3 spot on Saturday and Sunday, 
respectively.

“(Christner) is one of the best 

athletes I’ve ever coached, and 
she’s a fantastic hitter,” Hutchins 
said. “(She) just needs to get out of 
her own way, and we’re trying to 
help her because when she (does), 
she’ll be fine — when she believes.”

Though her overall numbers 

have dipped this season, Christner 
has maintained a steady influence 
on the team. One of three captains 
for the Wolverines — the lone 
junior — Christner has driven 
the team forward throughout the 
season due to her leadership more 
so than her performances. But 
while some players who experience 
slumps might wait until the next 
season to make their comeback, 
Christner has stepped up as a team 
leader once again, choosing to 
take advantage of the postseason 
instead.

“Honestly, a lot of (my offensive 

success) is just with my timing and 
rhythm,” Christner said. “Going in 
there with that confidence that no 
matter what I’ve done all season, 
it’s postseason time, so I might as 
well go out there, try something 
new (and) try to find ways on base, 
and I think that helped me out this 
weekend.”

Helping Michigan in any way she 

can, Christner has found a groove 
offensively 
and 
demonstrated 

her commitment to the team 
simultaneously. In order for the 
Wolverines to find success in the 
NCAA Super Regional and beyond, 
they will need their captain to 
continue trending upward, and 
Christner looks ready to deliver.
