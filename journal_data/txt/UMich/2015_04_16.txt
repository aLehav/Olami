CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Campus leaders cite 
policy modifications, 
increased involvement

By CAROLYN GEARIG

Daily Staff Reporter

In the last two years, the Uni-

versity 
community’s 
attitude 

toward sexual assault has been 
frequently 
discussed 
and, 
at 

times, hotly debated on campus.

Most recently, a report in The 

Michigan Daily identified a dis-
crepancy between the definition 
of consent applied by the Univer-
sity’s Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy and the one taught by the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center.

The Student Sexual Miscon-

duct Policy describes consent is 
a “clear and unambiguous agree-
ment, expressed in mutually 
understandable words or actions, 
to engage in a particular activ-
ity. Consent can be withdrawn 
by either party at any point.” 

SAPAC’s definition goes farther, 
identifying consent as an explicit-
ly verbal agreement, not satisfied 
by silence or body language.

Though the issue of sexual 

assault has faced scrutiny from 
University students and admin-
istrators, and even prompted an 
investigation by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education, a number of 
campus leaders say climate around 
sexual assault is improving.

SAPAC administrative coordi-

nator Jen Sharkey, a University 
alum, said the positive culture 

shift has been evidenced in part 
by an increase in the number of 
SAPAC student volunteers. Nine-
ty-two students joined in January. 
By contrast, 54 volunteers joined 
in 2014, 56 joined in 2013 and 25 
joined in 2012.

She said part of the reason the 

number of volunteers increased 
so rapidly was because of a new 
class offered through the Health 
Sciences and Women’s Studies 
Departments 
called 
“Gender-

Based Violence: From Theory 

Administrator’s 

comments spurred 
push for education 
on sexual assault

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

It was a cold January day in 

1985 when University students 
occupied former Vice President 
for Student Services Henry John-
son’s office to protest his com-
ments regarding sexual assault 
that appeared in Metropolitan 
Detroit Magazine.

The magazine quoted Johnson 

saying, “Rape is a red flag word 
— in many people’s minds it con-
jures up something that’s to be 
suspect at best — a very bad envi-
ronment to be in. (The University) 
wants to present an image that 
is receptive and palatable to the 
potential student cohort.”

He also compared rape to 

Alzheimer’s disease and mental 
retardation, saying it affected a 

small portion of the population 
and the issue may have to reach a 
crisis level “in order to get things 
done.”

He also said he didn’t antici-

pate a centralized rape prevention 
and treatment center because of 
the University’s current financial 
situation.

“Our responsibility is to pro-

vide, within our resources, a safe 
environment. Given the current 
(financial) climate, I just don’t see 
something labeled ‘rape preven-
tion clinic’ or ‘office’ as necessar-
ily germane to the mission of the 
institution. That’s a cold thing to 
say but it’s (so).”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Holly Rider-
Milkovich, director of the Sexual 
Assault Prevention Awareness 
Program, said the comments 
were taken as offensive by sexual 
assault survivors on campus.

“It was not intended to be an 

affront to survivors on campus, 
but survivors on campus definite-
ly took it that way,” she said.

Ford School hosts 
debate in advance 

of primaries in 

August

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ford School of Public Pol-

icy hosted a debate Wednesday 
between seven Democratic can-
didates running for City Council, 
addressing topics from affordable 
housing, police, traffic congestion 
and the electoral system in Ann 
Arbor.

The debate featured Ward 1 

candidates Sabra Briere (D–Ward 
1) and William Leaf; LSA senior 
Zachary Ackerman running for 
Ward 3; Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4) 
and Jamie Magiera running for 
Ward 4; and Mike Anglin (D–Ward 
5) and Chip Smith for the Ward 5.

No Republicans are currently 

running for seats on the council, 
meaning that August’s Demo-
cratic primary will largely decide 
who takes office in November, 
unless candidates from other par-
ties enter the race.

Public Policy Lecturer John 

Hieftje, former Ann Arbor mayor, 
organized and moderated the 
discussion with students from 
a class he teaches at the Ford 
School of Public Policy on local 
government.

Not all the candidates current-

ly running for office participated 
in Wednesday’s debate. Coun-
cilmember Stephen Kunselman 
(D–Ward 3), up for reelection this 

year, was not present. Sally Hart 
Petersen, who is running in the 
August Democratic primary for 
the Ward 2, was present in the 
audience, but did not participate 
in the debate.

In an interview after the event, 

Hieftje said an additional inde-
pendent candidate running in the 
Ward 1, Jeff Hayner, also did not 
participate because the debate 
focused on the August primary 
and not the November elections.

Councilmembers Kirk West-

phal (D–Ward 2) and Julie Grand 
(D–Ward 3), who are not up for 
election this coming year, were 
also present in the audience.

Affordable housing

Many questions asked candi-

dates to address the creation of 
more affordable housing in Ann 
Arbor. The issue has been dis-
cussed in various City Council 
meetings throughout the year 
— most recently, citizens spoke 
before council in favor of acces-
sory dwelling units.

Accessory dwelling units are 

built within a property and can 
take the form of either a separate 
unit within one’s own home or a 
new unit attached to the house. 
The unit can then be rented out.

Anglin said he believes recon-

sidering zoning regulations pres-
ent a useful tool, as the problem 
must be dealt with on the neigh-
borhood level.

Briere also favored zoning 

reconsideration 
to 
facilitate 

accessory dwelling units and 
denser neighborhoods. She added 
that all these schemes, however, 
would not solve the underlying 
factors that lead to expensive 

Protest supports 
national movement 

to raise pay to 
$15 an hour

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Imagine a $15 minimum wage.
Protesters in support of raising 

the minimum wage to $15 for Uni-
versity staff marched to the Flem-
ing Administration Building on 
Wednesday in hopes of receiving a 
response from the University.

LSA seniors Liana Kallman and 

Kamille Tynes led the protest, 
which called on the University 
and all of their subcontractors pay 
employees a minimum wage of $15 
and recognize and bargain with 
the appropriate union or organiza-
tion of employees.

Currently, the University sets 

minimum wage for temporary 
employees at the same rate as the 
state of Michigan. Minimum wage 

in the state of Michigan is $8.15 
per hour. Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
signed a bill into law last year that 
will increase the state’s minimum 
wage to $9.25 by 2018. Full-time 
University employees currently 
earn a University minimum wage 
of $22,320 per year, or $10.73 per 
hour.

The protesters at the Univer-

sity were not alone. The Guardian 
reported that protesters in cities 
across the country also rallied for 
a $15 minimum wage on Wednes-
day. These efforts follow decisions 
in Seattle and San Francisco to 
raise the minimum wage to $15 
per hour, and in Massachusetts 
to $11 per hour beginning in 2017. 
These numbers have surpassed 
the $10.10 federal minimum wage 
President Barack Obama called for 
during his 2014 State of the Union 
address and in a speech at the Uni-
versity in April 2014

The protesters gathered on the 

steps of South Quad Residence 
Hall holding signs reading, “$15 for 
all workers” and “15 and a Union.” 
They began by chanting: “What do 

we want? 15. When do we want it? 
Now.” and “Low pay is not OK.” 
Several individuals came forward 
to share their stories pertaining 
to wages. One such individual was 
University alum Blair Ellis, who 
spoke dressed in his Starbucks 
uniform.

“Asking for $15 an hour is ask-

ing to be part of a conversation,” 
Ellis said. “A lot of people say why 
they don’t want $15 an hour; they 
say it’s going to hurt small busi-
nesses or be too much of a change 
at once, and that’s a conversation 
that could be had, but that’s a con-
versation that’s being had amongst 
people who are making $15 an 
hour. If we want to make decisions 
that will have the best outcome, 
we need to have people who are 
involved to be a part of it, and if 
those people are working, then 
they can’t be a part of it.”

While he spoke, a small group 

of counter-protesters against rais-
ing the minimum wage shouted at 
him and booed.

Lawyers point to 
challenges beyond 
same-sex marriage 

legalization

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Before the U.S. Supreme 

Court hears a case on the 
legality of same-sex marriage, 
Outlaws, 
the 
University’s 

Law School LGBTQ organi-
zation, hosted a community 
conversation Wednesday on 
LGBTQ rights.

About 35 people attended 

the event, which began with 
speakers and then opened up 
to a Q&A session focused on 
LGBTQ issues in Michigan 
and the United States.

Speakers 
included 
Jay 

Kaplan, LGBT project attor-
ney for ACLU Michigan, Lisa 
Ruby, Michigan Poverty Law 
Program attorney and Angie 
Martell and S. Kerene Moore, 
co-chairs of the Washtenaw 
County 
Bar 
Association 

LGBTQ Rights Section.

The conversation centered 

on the upcoming Supreme 
Court case on the state’s ban 
on same-sex marriage. The 
court is scheduled to begin 
oral hearings on April 28. 
The case could have several 
major implications, including 
the possibility of legalizing 
same-sex marriage across the 
country.

Many attendees said they

Students lead march to raise 
minimum wage at the ‘U’


To Action.” The class, taught by 
Nursing Prof. Michelle Munro — 
a former participant in SAPAC’s 
Peer Education Volunteer Program 
and University alum — requires 
enrolled 
students 
to 
undergo 

SAPAC or SafeHouse volunteer 
training. In January, the class 
brought 30 new volunteers to 
SAPAC.

Sharkey has been employed by 

SAPAC since 2010, but has been 
involved with the organization 
since she was a freshman at the 
University in 2002.

When she was a student, Shar-

key said, SAPAC volunteers mainly 
focused on starting an initial dia-
logue about sexual assault, rather 
than facilitating it.

“It didn’t feel as prevalent or rel-

evant as it does today,” she said. “I 
feel like I was the student in class 
who was trying to bring in that per-
spective, and we had to try really 
hard to get volunteers and build 
relationships to do our workshops. 
Now, there’s not so much of a need 
to go out looking for that because 
people are coming to us.”

LSA junior Fabiana Diaz, who 

said she was sexually assaulted as a 
freshman, said there was a point at 
which she felt isolated and unable 
to tell anyone about her experi-
ences.

“When it first occurred, it was 

very a hush-hush situation,” she 
said. “I felt like I couldn’t speak 
to anyone about it. There were no 
communities where I felt I could 
talk to anybody about it except 
SAPAC.”

Diaz, a SAPAC volunteer and 

former 
LSA 
representative 
in 

the Central Student Government 
assembly, said she has seen a posi-
tive shift in campus climate since 
her first year here in 2012.

“I see it way more in my classes, 

and when I’m walking around I 
hear people talking about it,” she 
said. “The awareness is getting 
out there. I would still say there is 
a stigma around it but I’m seeing a 
lot of survivors sharing their sto-
ries. That bravery has opened a lot 
of doors and has given us a voice.”

Two years later

In September 2013, the Univer-

sity debuted a new sexual miscon-
duct policy, shifting from a model 
driven by complaints to one that 
more actively involves University 

investigators.

In the new policy’s first year, 

there was a sharp increase in the 
number of cases of reported sexual 
misconduct — which the Universi-
ty defines as “unwanted or unwel-
come conduct of a sexual nature 
that is committed without valid 
consent, including sexual assault 
and sexual harassment.”

According to the first Student 

Sexual Misconduct Annual Report 
released in November, 129 cases 
were reported to the University 
between June 2013 and June 2014. 
By comparison, 83 cases were 
reported from 2012 to 2013, 62 
were reported from 2011 to 2012 
and three were reported from 2010 
to 2011.

In January 2014, the Daily 

reported that former Michigan 
football kicker Brendan Gibbons 
was “permanently separated” from 
the University after he was found 
responsible for sexual misconduct. 
A Title IX complaint filed over this 
case ultimately resulted in a federal 
investigation into the University’s 
handling of sexual misconduct.

In April 2014, the Office of Stu-

dent Life hosted a panel discussion 
in partnership with the Daily about 
the University’s sexual misconduct 
policy, which included numerous 
administrators — SAPAC Direc-
tor Holly Rider-Milkovich; Dean 
of Students Laura Blake Jones; Jay 
Wilgus, Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution director; and Anthony 
Walesby, the University’s Title IX 
coordinator. The panel drew 40 
students.

“We are trailblazers,” Blake 

Jones said at the panel. “And an 
institution that most of the country 
looks to in terms of our prevention 
and education efforts.”

In September, Central Student 

Government planned a number of 
events pertaining to sexual assault 
in response to the White House’s 
“It’s On Us” campaign, which aims 
to end sexual assault at universities 
across the country.

In October, protesters cov-

ered the Diag with a list of seven 
demands calling for the University 
to improve campus sexual assault 
policies. Students carried mat-
tresses around campus to raise 
awareness of sexual assault and 
abusive relationships as a part of 
the national Carry That Weight 
campaign. The campaign origi-
nated when Columbia University 
senior Emma Sulkowicz began car-
rying a mattress around the New 
York City campus in September 
after her alleged rapist was found 

not responsible for sexual miscon-
duct by Columbia.

LSA junior Donald Lyons is the 

co-coordinator for SAPAC’s Men’s 
Activism 
Volunteer 
Program, 

which focuses on engaging men 
in the conversation surrounding 
sexual assault through workshops 
with a variety of campus commu-
nities like fraternities, athletics and 
ROTC.

Lyons said in the past few years, 

he has seen the Men’s Activism 
program triple in size, indicating 
men are becoming more involved 
in the dialogue about sexual 
assault. He said Carry That Weight 
exemplified this progress and cam-
pus-wide progress overall.

“If I were to choose one moment 

this year where I was like, this is 
going to be something that’s huge, 
that’s going to get people involved, 
it was Carry That Weight,” Lyons 
said. “I think that day on campus 
was so powerful.”

At SAPAC’s 28th annual Sexual 

Assault Speak Out in November, 
survivors were invited to speak 
openly about their experiences and 
attendance was so high — nearly 
300 people — that it was standing 
room only.

LSA junior Anna Forringer-Beal 

is a co-coordinator for SAPAC’s 
Networking, Publicity and Activ-
ism program, which organizes the 
Speak Out. In the five semesters 
Forringer-Beal has volunteered 
with SAPAC, she said she’s seen a 
shift in how prominent the issue is 
on campus.

She added that this year’s Speak 

Out was indicative of this shift.

“I’m so proud that we had such 

a huge attendance,” she said, “So 
many people came and shared and 
spoke and really took ownership of 
their healing and their experience. 
Bringing up these issues and talk-
ing about it and creating a space for 
survivors to share is just so monu-
mental.”

In January, University President 

Mark Schlissel announced that the 
University would randomly survey 
3,000 students about the climate 
and knowledge of sexual assault 
on campus, the results of which are 
now in and being compiled.

The University is also part of 

a 27-school survey distributed 
by the Association of American 
Universities to compare trends 
in sexual assault across campuses 
nationwide. This survey was sent 
to students March 31.

“I figured that it would be valu-

able to have us be able to compare 
our data to that at a lot of differ-
ent schools that are similar, big 
research universities, but different 
than us, to see how we’re doing,” 
Schlissel said in a January inter-
view with the Daily.

CSG, LSA Student Govern-

ment and the Engineering Student 
Government passed resolutions 
in February and March support-
ing the addition of the University’s 
Student Sexual Misconduct Policy 
to course syllabi. These proposals 
recommend but do not require pro-
fessors to add the policy.

LSA junior Laura Meyer, SAPAC 

volunteer coordinator, approached 
several student governments with 
the idea in February and CSG 
passed the resolution on March 17.

LSA senior Corey Walsh, former 

LSA-SG vice president, said there 
has been increased talk within the 
organization on this issue

“I think it’s permeating a lot of 

student organizations right now 
across the spectrum, partially 
because of the campus climate sur-
rounding it and partly because of 
national campaigns like It’s On Us,” 
Walsh said. “I think it’s something 
everyone can get on board with and 

wants to put an end to.”

LSA senior Emily Lustig, the 

former CSG vice president, echoed 
Walsh’s sentiment.

“Sexual 
assault 
awareness 

in 
general 
has 
exponentially 

increased across campus,” she said. 
“I think we have a really strong 
community that is really passion-
ate. I think it has fostered a very 
different environment than the one 
I came in to.”

Additionally, the recent Daily 

report raised questions regarding 
how the University handles the 
investigation and sanctioning pro-
cesses following a report of sexual 
assault — pointing out discrepan-
cies between SAPAC’s definition of 
consent and the definition outlined 
in the University’s Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy.

In response to the article, 

SAPAC updated information on its 
web page about consent.

“One of the core values that 

guides SAPAC’s work is respect,” 
the new page reads. “And for 
SAPAC, consent is respect. As we 
work towards a world free of sexual 
assault, intimate partner violence, 
stalking and sexual harassment, 
we promote equality and respect 
for all members of our commu-
nity through our commitment to 
primary prevention. Our primary 
prevention approach is centered 
on our vision and hope for a future 
where we all expect consent for 
sexual activity to be verbal or oral, 
sober, and enthusiastic.”

However, language around the 

University’s definition of consent — 
as articulated in the Student Sex-
ual Misconduct Policy — remains 
largely unchanged compared to a 
version of the website updated on 
Jan. 17, 2015.

Culture shift and targeting 

specific demographics

In the last year, perhaps one of 

the most concentrated student-
driven forums for discussion about 
sexual assault and violence was the 
Culture Shift retreat in January.

Forringer-Beal, Diaz and LSA 

juniors Meagan Shokar and Olivia 
Rath organized the two-day event 
in conjunction with the Office of 
Student Life to focus on topics such 
as rape culture and the University’s 

sexual misconduct policy.

“We wanted to bring people, 

and bring student leaders, togeth-

er to give them a space to learn 
and collaborate,” Forringer-Beal 
said. “It was a strategic way to try 
and have this conversation collec-
tively.”

Diaz said one of her goals is to 

bring more identities to the con-
versation, from men to members 
of the LGBTQ community to Black 
students.

“We need more intersection-

ality on our campus,” Diaz 
said. “We always focus on 
one identity, when survivors 
have multiple identities. We 
want to continue educating 
because that is the only way 
this will happen — by educat-
ing student leaders, who will 
pass that down. There’s not a 
united place where (student 
leaders) can all come together, 
and that’s what we are trying 
to do with Culture Shift, so we 
actually do create a shift in our 
culture.”

In this vein, Lyons said he 

hopes some of the dialogue 
about sexual assault will help 
men to broaden their perspec-
tives and understand more 
nuanced narratives.

“Since there’s so much pop-

ular discourse around sexual 
assault, a lot of narratives end 
up being ‘those poor women’ 
narratives,” he said. “This can 

be unproduc-
tive 
because 

part of what 
we 
want 
to 

talk about is 
the 
systems 

surrounding 
these 
situa-

tions.”

Targeting 

men, in par-
ticular, is not 
a new concept 
for 
sexual 

assault educa-
tion.

Like 
Cul-

ture Shift, I 
Will, a sexual 
assault aware-
ness campaign 
established in 
February 2013, 
aims to make 
sexual assault a 
less taboo topic 
for all mem-
bers 
of 
the 

community.

The 
pro-

gram, 
orga-

nized by four 
then-LSA 
seniors, launched with the support 
of SAPAC, OSCR and the Univer-
sity’s Athletic Department.

University alum Josh Buoy, one 

of I Will’s founders, said in Febru-
ary 2013 that the program would 
place additional focus on men.

“Sexual assault and violence 

takes so many forms beyond rape, 
and that’s what we really want to 
do — we really want to educate — 
what qualifies as sexual assault 
because I think so many people, 
especially of the male gender, don’t 
know what it is,” Buoy said. “With 
this campaign, we’re working with 
everyone where they are.”

LSA senior Hannah Crisler, I 

Will director and a former ath-
lete, said she saw a big change, 
especially within athletics, after it 
was reported that former football 
kicker Gibbons was permanently 
separated from the University in 
January 2013.

“It’s just so prominent in our 

culture right now,” she said. “Defi-
nitely having one of your star foot-
ball players kicked out of school for 
doing a horrific act is going to stir 
up the water.”

I Will regularly hosts coffee 

shop events for students to talk 
about specific issues, in addition 
to workshops with CSG and other 
campus organizations and an 
awareness week every April.

What the future holds

Public Policy senior Laurel 

Ruza, the former CSG vice speak-
er, is an It’s On Us student orga-
nizer. Though she wasn’t directly 

involved with organizations dis-
cussing the issue before this year, 
Ruza said she’s noticed a change 
now that sexual assault is a more 
prominent part of campus conver-
sation.

“When I was a freshman, I went 

through Relationship Remix and 
we had that hour and a half long 
conversation, and then it died off 
and the conversation ended,” she 
said. “What I’m starting to see now 
is that conversation is continuing in 
a lot of aspects on campus.”

Ruza said she thinks that a lot 

of progress needs to be made, both 
among students and administra-
tors.

“I think there’s a ton more work 

to be done,” she said. “For a lot of 
campus, this really isn’t a topic of 
conversation. I think that admin-
istrators are recognizing that stu-
dent voices around this issue are 
critical, and that students really do 
have a unique perspective. More 
work can be done in terms of edu-
cating the campus and raising 
awareness.”

Diaz said, she most of all hopes 

to see more education on campus 
about sexual violence.

“I wish that, on campus, every-

one knew what a survivor was, 
and the real statistics of it, and the 
whole idea that it can happen to 
you,” she said. “It’s very possible. 
It can happen to your friend, your 
roommate. One people start open-
ing their eyes to those facts, I think 
we’ll see a shift in our culture.”

of the countermovement, said he 
led the protest because he believes 
minimum wages are destructive, 
in part because they cause people 
to lose their jobs when employ-
ers can’t afford to pay all of their 
employees after a pay raise.

Miller said raising the University 

minimum wage to $15 would not be 
beneficial for the community.

“Prices will go up, prices will be 

worse off in the long run,” he said.

The protesters marched from 

South Quad to the steps of the 
Michigan Union. Upon reaching 

the Union, individuals were given 
another opportunity to discuss 
why the cause was important to 
them. Tynes recounted times she 
simultaneously worked and took 
classes at the University, when she 
worried about being evicted from 
her apartment and her electricity 
being turned off.

“I’m here today because I under-

stand the struggle; I understand 
not living a lavish life, but still just 
trying to have the bare minimum,” 
Tynes said. “As a worker, and as 
a student worker, we have to do 
something to make sure that people 
aren’t struggling. Some people are 
just trying to eat food — we are not 
a third world country — and at the 
University of Michigan, we are the 

leaders and the best, so we need to 
take up and step up and fight for 15.”

Kallman advised the protest-

ers to leave one of their large ban-
ners lying on the steps of the Union 
so that passerby would see them. 
From there, the protesters contin-
ued on to the Fleming Administra-
tion Building.

Sociology Lecturer Ian Robin-

son attended the rally and spoke in 
favor of raising the wage.

“I would say almost everybody 

on the council is strongly sup-
portive of this because we realize 
that we can’t really have a labor 
movement that’s just comprised of 
unions,” Robinson said. “If we had 
just kept up our minimum wage 
with inflation, let alone productiv-

ity, in the real dollar terms back in 
the late ’60s, we’d be about $18 an 
hour for minimum wage.”

During this portion, some of the 

leading members of the movement 
marched inside to speak with Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel, 
but when they reached his office, 
they were met by police officers. 
The protesters said they handed the 
officers the list of demands, read 
them aloud and left. They said they 
have already e-mailed the regents 
and are awaiting a response from 
them. If the regents do not answer, 
protesters said they are willing to 
take less “polite” action.

“We explained to them that 

we’re doing it politely this time, 
we’re not trying to walk in there 

and cause a ruckus, but that’s not 
going to be true next time,” Ellis 
said.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University has 
received the list of demands but has 
yet to address them.

“It’s not unusual for our students 

to make their point of view known 
on different topics and we certainly 
respect their rights to bring this 
issue to the attention of the Univer-
sity community,” Fitzgerald said. 
“At this point, they did drop off a 
letter to the president’s office, and 
we’ll have to take a careful look at 
that.”

housing in Ann Arbor.

“We are not going to get any-

where if we don’t also tackle the 
income disparity that’s in our 
community,” she said “And that’s 
a bigger issue than just talking 
about housing affordability.”

Leaf also noted that restriction 

of housing supplies due to current 
zoning restrictions is a funda-
mental cause of expensive hous-
ing in the city.

CANDIDATES

Supreme 
Court 
decision 
will 

impact LGBTQ families in Michi-
gan as well as understand the cur-
rent legal landscape.

Moore, who is also the vice 

president of the Jim Toy Com-
munity Center — a group focused 
on offering resources to LGBTQ 
individuals in Washtenaw County 
— said she thought the law com-
munity as a whole was becoming 
more open to granting legal sta-
tuses to LGBTQ individuals.

One example, she noted, is how 

courts are addressing divorces 
between same-sex couples.

“We’ve had a few judges here 

in Washtenaw County who have 
entertained annulments and we 
had one judge perform a divorce,” 
Moore said. “It’s a lot of pressure, 
but the legal community is com-
ing around. We’ve been working 
on the conversation of how to give 
same-sex marriage these legal 
rights.”

Martell, an attorney special-

izing in family law, said the legal 
definition of marriage is also an 
ongoing issue. She said many in 
the legal community still disagree 
over the differences between mar-
riage as a civil concept and mar-
riage as a religious institution.

According to Martell, civil 

marriage 
doesn’t 
differentiate 

between gender or sex, whereas 
many conceptions of religious 

marriage do.

“I believe the U.S. Constitution 

has required universal marriage 
equality,” Martell said. “We’ve 
gotten lost in the difference 
between civil marriage and reli-
gious marriage.”

Kaplan, 
from 
the 
ACLU, 

addressed the potential aftermath 
of the Supreme Court case specifi-
cally, citing several other issues as 
areas of concern for the LGBTQ 
community in Michigan.

“One fear that I hold is that 

many people will think that once 
we have marriage equality, that 
everything will be taken care of,” 
Kaplan. “We still have tons of 
issues to take care of. For example, 
in most communities in Michi-
gan, it’s legal to be fired from a job 
because you’re gay.”

Kaplan also touched on the 

Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act, which has generated national 
controversy in recent weeks fol-
lowing the passage of a similar 
proposal in Indiana.

The RFRA is also a federal law 

that aims to protect religious free-
dom by allowing businesses and 
individuals to not follow laws they 
deem in violation of their religious 
beliefs. Because of a 1997 Supreme 
Court decision that ruled the fed-
eral RFRA not applicable to state 
laws, multiple states have passed 
their own state RFRAs. In Michi-
gan, no RFRA has been passed, 
but a bill has been introduced sev-
eral times over the past few years.

“The marriage equality for 

same sex couples is coming, and 
(RFRA) is the last gasp of people 
trying to find their way around it,” 
Kaplan said.

Kaplan also highlighted some 

challenges 
transgender 
people 

face in Michigan.

“We make it very hard for trans-

gender individuals to get a driver’s 
license or a state ID,” Kaplan said. 
“We require that a transgender 
has to have surgery and have a 
gender mark and change on a 
birth certificate. This is expen-
sive, complicated and dangerous 
to many people.”

Ruby, with the Michigan Pov-

erty Law Program, focused her 
remarks primarily on discrep-
ancies found in Social Security, 
adoption agencies and public ben-
efits for LGBTQ individuals.

Following 
the 
speaker’s 

remarks, the panel opened up 
to questions from the audience, 
many of which touched on per-
sonal questions such as how they 
could file for taxes as a same-sex 
couple or what their legal rights 
were if married in a different 
states.

The conversation ended on the 

topic of homophobia. Ruby said 
she hopes the idea of homosexual-
ity was becoming less alien to peo-
ple. She recounted her former fear 
of using the term “wife” to address 
her partner.

However, she said she receives 

many positive reactions to her 
relationship and no longer feels 
that kind of discomfort.

then an LSA undergraduate, was 
among the students who partici-
pated in the sit-in. In an interview 
with the Daily, Kisch said one of 
the goals of the sit-in was to edu-
cate Johnson about sexual assault 
on campus.

“We spent the day in his office 

and we educated him about date 
rape and acquaintance rape, and 
that those were huge issues on 
campus, and the things he said in 
the magazine weren’t true,” she 
said.

Kisch also said she and other 

protesters felt University admin-
istration did not view sexual 
assault as a relevant issue on 
campus.

“The comments he made real-

ly made it clear to us that Univer-
sity administration didn’t really 
take these issues seriously and 
were really kind of clueless about 
the lives of women on campus in 
this regard,” she said.

Rider-Milkovich said students 

also wanted to discuss the need 
to open a rape crisis center for 
students on campus.

“The students really wanted 

for there to be more institutional 
infrastructure and for there to 
be more of a comprehensive and 
integrated response, and more 
specific dedicated resources for 
sexual assault survivors,” she 
said.

Following the protest, Univer-

sity administrators created a task 
force comprising students and 
administrators to develop an out-
line for a sexual assault program 
for the campus community.

“It couldn’t be just a little 

office somewhere,” Kisch said. 
“It needed to be its own program, 
with its own budget and direc-
tor and needed to be on Central 
Campus.”

In May 1985, the University 

approved $75,000 for an assault 
prevention program for the cam-
pus community.

Students played a significant 

role in helping operate the pro-
gram early on. Kisch collabo-
rated with fellow protester David 
Lovinger to develop the Peer 
Education Program and become 
the program’s first co-leaders.

“We trained students and 

sent one man and one woman to 
groups of students to model and 
demonstrate things like stereo-
types around men and women 
and what consent really was,” 
Kisch said. “The Peer Education 
Program launched even before 
the first director was hired.”

It was not until February 

1986 that the program officially 
opened and named the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center, hiring Julie Steiner 
as the first director.

In 1988, SAPAC launched its 

24-hour crisis line, which was, 
at first, monitored by students. 
Rider-Milkovich said they even-

tually decided to hire profession-
als for the job to protect students 
from trauma.

“The University made the 

determination that students who 
were staffing the crisis line and 
answering crisis line calls would 
sometimes experience secondary 
trauma and came to the decision 
that that was not responsible for 
us to allow,” she said.

Rider-Milkovitch 
also 
said 

another one of SAPAC’s bigger 
innovations was transforming 
the program to focus more on 
intervention rather than sexual 
assault education.

“We wanted to move away 

from awareness raising kind of 
model to one that focused more 
on primary prevention and pro-
moting healthy sexuality,” she 
said. “Now, college campuses 
across the country are mandated 
to provide that type of training.”

This year, as SAPAC celebrates 

its 30th anniversary, Rider-
Milkovich said she wants to work 
with her colleagues to continue 
providing necessary innovations 
for the program.

“We are always scanning the 

horizon and looking for what are 
the most promising practices out 
there,” she said. “We ask our-
selves, ‘What are new ideas that 
need to be tested? What are ways 
in which we see gaps in the kinds 
of services the campus provides 
that we might innovate or pilot for 
the benefit of students and oth-
ers?’”

T

he concept of choice is really 
interesting, both in econom-
ics and its real-life implica-

tions. When you 
eat out for lunch, 
what makes you 
choose one res-
taurant over the 
other? It’s easy to 
justify 
decisions 

like that by saying, 
“It’s what I want-
ed.” But why did 
you want it?

Basic economic 

theory tells us that 
human beings are rational and make 
decisions that maximize their util-
ity, or benefit, from a purchase. This 
makes a lot of sense and is pretty 
intuitive. If you’re deciding between 
an apple and an orange, if you want 
the apple more, you’re going to pick it 
because it provides you more utility.

But this model of human rational-

ity doesn’t always hold, and it only 
leads us to wonder why we make the 
purchases that we do.

Take, for instance, the paradox of 

choice. This theory states that pro-
viding humans with more options can 
actually hinder people from choosing 
what they want the most. Traditional 
economic theory assumes that a con-
sumer with more options will be able 
to evaluate the utility of each option 
and choose the one that’s best for 
them. Since consumers have more 
options, they should benefit through 
having more options to maximize 
their utility.

Contrary to this notion, a recent 

study revealed that consumers with 
just six options for jelly were more 
likely to purchase one than those who 
were offered 24. The intuition behind 
this idea is that humans have a more 
difficult time processing all the avail-

able options, and will therefore have 
a harder time coming to a conclusion.

See how it can be much more 

complicated 
than, 
“It’s 
what 
 

I wanted?”

Traditional economics fails to 

incorporate human irrationality and 
psychological functioning into its 
model. This leads to a big problem, 
in that it insinuates humans are stiff 
in an unrealistically robotic manner. 
We’re not robots.

Instead, 
factors 
outside 
of 

rationality mix with utility to explain 
why we consume what we do. 
Take, for instance, our capacity for 
exerting energy. A robot is capable of 
performing tasks with the same level 
of energy and precision, but if we as 
humans are constantly bombarded 
with the need to make decisions, 
we get tired. Choosing something 
over something else requires energy. 
At times when we must make 
decisions in rapid succession, we 
have the potential to lose the desire 
to maximize our utility, and we just 
want to be finished with a task.

I’ve certainly experienced this. 

After winding through the aisles of 
a grocery store, I’m ready to check 
out. So when I get to the cheese sec-
tion, I’m ready to just throw in the 
first pack of square dairy that I see, 
whether it’s pepper jack or muenster.

We’re also susceptible to our 

emotions influencing which decision 
we believe maximizes our utility. 
This is exemplified by the concept 
of overconfidence, which states that 
we’re more susceptible to purchase 
something when we or others have 
trust in it. It doesn’t matter whether 
the product is actually trustworthy, 
but rather, what’s important is that 
consumers believe something is 
trustworthy. For example, if you 
grow up in a household that only 

purchases Jif peanut butter, it’s 
pretty likely that you’ll develop an 
inherent trust in the product. If this 
happens, you’ll have more trust in Jif 
peanut butter, and likely purchase it, 
whether or not it’s actually the brand 
that you’d like the most.

So we’re not completely rational, 

but economics can still help us 
explain why we choose to consume 
certain things over others. Though 
the traditional model isn’t completely 
accurate, when we incorporate what 
we know about human irrationality, 
we can adjust the model to account 
for human emotion and psychology.

It’s important for us to recognize 

the power of what these theories 
can do for us. They have the power 
to tell us why we consume what we 
do, and what obstacles cause us to 
make irrational decisions. Knowing 
the intricacies of concepts like 
paradox theory provide us a portal 
into our own mindset and why we 
choose to purchase what we do. If 
we understand these theories, there’s 
also a possibility that we can become 
mindful of our irrationality, which 
could lead us to force ourselves to 
overcome our initial irrationality in 
place for what maximizes our utility.

At the very least, when you have 

24 options of grape jelly, make sure 
to at least pick one. If you really can’t 
decide, I’d recommend grape. And 
don’t immediately pick the peanut 
butter that you grew up eating. Try 
some variety. Natural peanut butter 
does wonders over regular in sticki-
ness value.

After writing this column, I’m 

going to need a peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich, whether it’s rational 
to consume or not.

Finding the peanut butter to your jelly

MICHAEL 
SCHRAMM

The 2016 presidential campaign season 

has just started up its proverbial engines, and 
many see this election as simply a decision of 
Republican versus Democrat as opposed to a 
competition between two unique individuals 
who happen to belong to their respective 
political parties. As Paul Krugman wrote in a 
recent New York Times article, regardless of 
who our next president is, their platform will 
be fairly predictable simply based on their party 
label. This reality clearly has palpable effects 
on our nation and its governing system — as 
parties become more extreme and drift further 
away from one another, it becomes increasingly 
difficult to effectively govern a nation that 
is yearning for some degree of action out of 
Washington D.C.

Krugman wrote, “ … there has never been 

a time in American history when the alleged 
personal traits of candidates mattered 
less.” To me, the personal characteristics 
of an individual vying to become arguably 
the single most important person on the 
face of the planet should certainly have an 
effect on voting tendencies. For instance, a 
candidate may possess all the right ideas, but 
if they cannot communicate those policies 
or lack the necessary skill of conveying 
those ideals to our nation’s policy makers, 
then it would not be wise to put that person 
in a position of considerable power. Or, if 
a candidate is particularly divisive and is 
unable to work cooperatively with other 
members of government, then that person 
is, similarly, likely unfit for office. Personal 
traits can go a long way in alleviating many 
of the issues that currently bottleneck our 
 

governing system.

Recently, there have been several campaign 

announcements — Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, 
Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio have all told 
the world they will attempt to become the next 
president of the United States. The fact remains 
that all of these candidates carry their own 
personal baggage, and both parties are already 
churning out attack advertisements targeting 
one another.

Thus, it is possible that we haven’t found 

one uniting persona because of both parties’ 
immediate inclination to write off any member 
of the opposing party as wholeheartedly 
incorrect in their political assertions. Certainly, 
part of campaigning involves juxtaposing 
oneself with the other candidate with regards 
to policy platforms. However, as Mr. Krugman 
puts it, “(this) level of political polarization 
(has) not (been) seen since the Civil War.”

What this country truly needs is an 

individual who possesses not only a sound 
mind able to advocate positive policy reforms, 
but also the all-too-important quality of being 
able to serve beyond their party label and 
work alongside — in a friendly manner — those 
across the aisle. Obviously, this type of person is 
fairly hard to come by, but some of our greatest 
presidents have been able to fit this description. 
Names such as George Washington, Abraham 
Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy 
and others conjure up feelings of better times 
in simpler eras.

Yet all of these men faced tremendous 

adversity stemming from political opponents 
— but their personal traits helped to guide the 
nation through those times of peril.

Can we expect another legendary president 

to ascend our nation’s political hierarchy 
any time soon? We can only hope. For now, 
however, it remains imperative that we elect 
someone with a personality that will be more 
than suitable for the White House. Moreover, 
we must all work to collectively shed the 
extreme labels of our political parties, and 
try to once again form a government that 
will cater to the true needs of an increasingly 
 

anxious population.

Obviously, most of my rhetoric sounds 

extremely idealistic and general in nature. 
Nonetheless, I would contend that these ideals 
aren’t necessarily at the conscious forefront 
of some of those who occupy the highest 
positions in our government. Hopefully this 
message will be heard by our current leaders, 
along with those who aspire to one day be in 
government — even the presidency.

BENJAMIN KELLER | VIEWPOINT
Individuals, not parties

On March 8, when you saw a post on 

Facebook, 
Twitter 
or 
Instagram 
with 

#InternationalWomensDay or #IWD2015, 
what did you do? Did you like or share the 
photo? Did you try to figure out more about 
International Women’s Day? Did you question 
gender boundaries?

You, like me, probably did nothing. At most, 

you read the content, sent out a quick response 
or had a conversation about the topic, and 
then moved on. Through talking about three 
campaigns, I will show you that a human 
rights social media campaign has no impact on 
long-term change. These campaigns only raise 
awareness for a short amount of time, and then 
become erased in memory.

On International Women’s Day this year, 

one of the most popular campaigns was the 
#NotThere campaign. Social media users 
removed their profile photos and replaced it 
with the silhouette of a woman, showing that 
there is a long way to go to achieve gender 
equality. According to the New York Times, the 
campaign also removed women’s faces from 40 
advertisements — leaving blank spaces where 
Scarlett Johansson was on the March cover of 
W magazine and where Serena Williams was 
on a billboard in Times Square.

The #NotThere campaign was great for a 

one-day campaign: it drove over 100,000 people 
to learn about gender equality by visiting the 
Not There website and interacting with data 
involving the status of women and girls. But I, 
like journalist Mahvish Ahmed, believe many 
readers and future activists needed to hear 
more of the emotional stories to understand the 
heart of the human rights issue instead of just 
seeing the numbers. Now more than a month 
after International Women’s Day, #NotThere 
is literally not there and the data is no longer 
publicized. #NotThere brought up gender 
inequality issues for one day, allowing the 
public to momentarily be more aware.

Beginning in late September 2014 and 

ending on Dec. 15, 2014, the Occupy Central 
conflict began in Hong Kong through protests. 
According to an article in The China Journal by 
Ian Scott, the campaign’s primary demand was 
for citizens to directly nominate and elect the 
chief executive of Hong Kong’s government, 
instead of only having pro-Beijing chief 
executives elected. Western and international 
media quickly called these protests the 

“Umbrella Revolution,” since protesters used 
umbrellas to protect themselves against police 
brutality by tear gas.

On social media, Occupy Central created 

its own handle (@OCLPHR), which served as 
a united front to update protesters and share 
information. Content was released by protesters 
and supporters through the #OccupyHK and 
#UmbrellaRevolution hashtags. The social 
media campaign encouraged those in Hong 
Kong to unify and protest, and also allowed for 
international recognition on the human rights 
issue. Now, over six months after the Occupy 
Central campaign, the Hong Kong government 
has not budged, and requests for a complete 
democracy have been ignored.

The final example of a human rights 

social media campaign is the Human Rights 
Campaign’s support for marriage equality 
initiative. On March 25, 2013, the campaign 
launched, asking supporters to change their 
profile photo to a red-tinted version of the HRC 
logo. The new logo symbolized supporting 
marriage equality as the United States Supreme 
Court debated California’s Proposition 8 and 
the Defense of Marriage Act. Celebrities, 
prominent brands, politicians and the American 
public turned the Internet into a sea of red, 
with over 2.7 million Facebook users updating 
their profile photos. Many think this campaign 
was successful due to mass awareness of the 
marriage equality discussion and what was and 
currently is at stake. Although there was mass 
awareness, I do not think most people learned 
more about human rights challenges facing 
non-heterosexual couples. To me, the mass 
awareness was more about everyone on social 
media feeling the need to fit in for a 24-to-48 
hour period instead of gaining knowledge 
and advocating for long-term changes in 
 

marriage equality.

The International Women’s Day #NotThere 

campaign, Hong Kong’s Occupy Central 
campaign 
and 
HRC’s 
marriage 
equality 

campaign were all initiatives amplified by 
social media over a relatively short amount of 
time. In order for these campaigns to have any 
sort of long-term impact, campaign organizers 
must motivate social media users to understand 
the core of the issue and then provide clear 
action points to inspire change.

Awareness doesn’t equal action

“All you guys do is bitch.”
“Michigan in Color is just a place 

where people complain.”

“Whenever you all bring up race, I 

can never win.”

Though they take many forms, I 

often hear and read sentiments such 
as these, expressed by white people, 
when referring to people of color 
talking about race. These white 
readers speak of wanting to engage 
in deep, meaningful exchanges 
regarding skin-privilege in our 
society, yet feel unfairly boxed out 
by angry people of color.

Just yesterday, one of the MiC 

editors received yet another of these 
responses, 
expressing 
annoyance 

with White-collar whiteness. He 
said, “This is what I understand 
when I read (the article): ‘I’m going 
to bring up a topic and I want us to 
have a productive conversation about 
it. But in the course of this productive 
conversation, I don’t want you to 
argue, remain silent or leave. If you in 
any way challenge my point of view, I 
will suggest that you are either racist 
or furthering racism.’ 

What that suggests to me is that 

the author wants white-skinned 
people to have “conversations” with 
her that consist only of them nodding 
their heads and saying, “uh-huh” 
over and over again ... You cannot 
respect someone with whom you 
cannot be honest. This strategy 
eventually translates to, “Don’t say 
what you think, because you’ll hurt 
my feelings if you do.”

Though I am undoubtedly biased 

(I am a Michigan in Color editor, 
after all), I can understand the “you 
all say you want an open dialogue 
about race but then shut it down” 
sentiment that some of our white 
readers have shared. I can see how 
it’s difficult to see the nuances of a 
seemingly contradictory statement 
that many of our contributors 
express (and one that I personally 
share) 
when 
you 
don’t 
know 

what it feels like to have the same 
conversations about race on a regular, 
if not daily, basis. So I’ll explain.

Trying to have a conversation 

about systemic racism with someone 
who knows little about it invokes 
similar frustrations in me (and, I 
suspect, other people of color) as it 
does to others when trying to discuss 
March Madness brackets with me. 
You see, I grew up in a household 
where we didn’t really talk about 

basketball. Because sports-minded 
people were never in my social 
circle, it has always been incredibly 
normal to not think about — and 
consequently not care about — sports 
events that occur. Even when big 
things like the Super Bowl and 
NBA Playoffs are going on, athletics 
are barely on my radar. I honestly 
don’t understand why people in this 
country want to talk about sports 
so much, why they evoke so much 
emotion and why people feel so 
strongly about identifying with their 
chosen teams.

When someone who likes sports 

tries to talk about them with me, 
I struggle to have an effective 
conversation with them — at least 
from their perspective. Not because 
I don’t want to, and not because I’m 
not willing to try to, but because I 
am at a significant knowledge deficit. 
The only things I can really speak to 
are things I’ve either seen on TV (go 
Duke?) or heard about from that one 
local team I’m semi-familiar with 
(yay Michigan!). Because I’ve said 
things like, “I like that team because I 
look good in their colors” and “I hope 
they win because their quarterback 
is cute” in the past, people who 
had previously wanted to have a 
conversation about sports with me 
now roll their eyes and dismiss me 
in frustration. It’s not as though my 
opinion will always be unwanted, but 
as of right now, it’s uninformed.

That 
sense 
of 
irritation 
is 

whatI feel when trying to have an 
intelligent conversation about race 
with most white people. While I 
don’t blame them for having limited 
— or no — experiences with race, 
it’s repetitive and unproductive to 
talk about something so complex 
with someone who often doesn’t 
even know what modern-day racism 
looks like. Because I’m Black, society 
has forced me to see how race 
colors our personal interactions and 
social mobility. For me, it has been 
inescapable. As a white person, it’s 
easier to miss. This doesn’t mean you 
won’t get a seat at the table; I want 
you there with me. But at a table 
where I so often don’t have a voice 
and instead have my story told for 
me, I need you to first listen.

I’m 
not 
going 
to 
have 

conversations about race if your 
main focus is on defending the 
intent of a racist action, instead 
of analyzing the impact it creates. 

I am unwilling to discuss police 
brutality if your working knowledge 
of the topic started and ended with 
Ferguson. I won’t have a dialogue 
on the merits and drawbacks of 
Affirmative Action if the bedrock 
of your opinion is an Ivy-league 
rejection letter. Maybe you view this 
strategy as me saying: “Don’t say 
what you think, because you’ll hurt 
my feelings if you do,” but in reality, 
I’m saying “Don’t say what you 
think if you have unfounded opinions 
because it is both offensive and a 
waste of our time.” I do want to have 
the conversation, but not if you don’t 
know what you’re talking about.

I know that you will never truly 

understand what it feels like to walk 
in my shoes. I don’t expect you to. But 
in the same way that I have ample 
insight into a broad spectrum of 
white people’s experiences — from 
history classes, from TV shows, 
from books, from magazines, from 
commercials, from news reports, 
from social media, from white 
friends, from white boyfriends, from 
white family members, from being 
raised in a majority-white society — 
I need you to have some insight into 
the experiences of my people if we are 
going to have the honest, respectful 
conversation you say you desire. 
You may consider this information 
gathering to be “nodding (your) 
heads and saying ‘uh-huh’ over and 
over again,” but I view your learning 
about the oppression of others as 
helping get you up to speed. As I see 
it, you cannot earnestly challenge 
a perspective until you (at least 
partially) understand it.

Of the white people in my life, a 

good number share equal airtime 
with me in conversations about 
race. A larger number don’t. The 
latter have yet to show me that 
they’re willing to consider facts, 
viewpoints 
and 
experiences 

unfamiliar to them. You might see 
that as “bitching” or “complaining,” 
but for these exchanges to be 
productive from my perspective, 
I need to be met halfway. Maybe 
it’s unfair that I won’t have truly 
engaged conversations on race with 
just anyone. Maybe it makes you 
feel like you “can never win.” But 
that’s one racial privilege you’ll 
have to earn.

Thursday, April 16, 2015 — 5A

W

ell, my friends, the 
time has finally 
come. This is it. 

The final scene. The closing 
sentence. The last column. The 
end.

Last 

summer, 
when 
I 

applied 
to be the 
literary 
columnist 
here at The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
I 

had 
no 

idea 
what 

to expect. I wasn’t anticipating 
literary-centered spring breaks 
or the fact that one of the 
most celebrated and reclusive 
American authors was going to 
release another book. Truly, the 
literary gods have been good to 
me.

No, all I knew was that I 

wanted to write about my 
passion, 
and 
so 
came 
the 

column. Writing during that 
labyrinth known as the last year 
of college has been delightfully 
challenging. In the past eight 
months, 
I’ve 
experienced 

happiness, 
heartache 
and 

Harbaugh.

It’s been quite a ride, but now 

it’s time for me to say goodbye. 
So what final words do I have 
for you?

Read! Read everything and 

anything you can get your 
hands on. Yes, read books, 
poems and plays, but also read 
newspapers, magazines, flyers 
and the back of cereal boxes. 
Why? Because you never know 
what you might learn from even 
the most commonplace of texts.

Read! Read whenever and 

wherever you can. Read before 
you go to bed. Read when you 
first wake up. Read on the 
treadmill. Read on the bus, but 
don’t miss your stop! Read while 
you’re waiting for something 
to start. Why? Because at any 
time, you have the power to 
transport yourself to anywhere 
you want to be, so why settle for 

a subway station or a line at the 
post office?

If there’s one point I would 

like to leave with you, it’s this: 
You are the author of your life. 
Your story is important. So 
write yourself into adventure, 
mystery, romance, action and 
comedy. Fill your life with all 
manner of strange and exciting 
characters, but know when to 
write certain people out. Every 
so often, change up your setting 
or pacing, if just to keep things 
interesting. 
Accept 
nothing 

less than poetry. And always 
remember, at any moment, you 
can start on a new chapter.

It’s difficult to explain how 

significant writing the literary 
column has been to me. For 
someone who embodies the 
phrase “painfully shy,” and 
who’s much more comfortable 
listening to the thoughts of 
others 
than 
espousing 
my 

own, who doesn’t often speak 
up unless directly asked; this 
column has provided me a 
space for self-reflection and 
exploration that has made it 
possible for me to not only find 
my voice, but to claim it. It has 
allowed me to be bold, in my 
own, quiet way.

And 
perhaps 
most 

importantly, my columns have 
introduced me to you lovely 
readers. It has been a pleasure 
speaking with you and learning 
about your own thoughts about 
and connections to my literary 
ramblings.

Whether it was lamenting 

the football season or pitching 
the premise for my sitcom 
(seriously, let’s get that thing on 

the air), you have come to know 
me as both a writer and as a 
person, and I pray that you have 
not found me too sorely lacking 
as either.

And now we come to the 

sweet sorrow that is parting. 
But before this columnist goes 
gentle into that good night, 
a few final words, to you, my 
dearest readers.

If this is the first time you’ve 

read one of my columns, I 
sincerely thank you for your 
interest and I apologize for the 
copious amount of schmaltz.

If you’ve been with me 

from the beginning, I can 
only assume we’re related and 
I’ll see you at the next family 
function. If, on the off chance, 
we’re not bound by blood or 
marriage but you’ve still stuck 
with me, I cannot adequately 
express 
my 
gratitude 
and 

astonishment. In short, let’s 
start a book club.

Please 
know 
if 
I 
ever 

provided even a moment of 
entertainment or introspection 
among you, dear readers, I will 
consider my time as a columnist 
a rousing success.

It has truly been an honor 

to share in your Thursdays 
and 
encourage 
community 

discussions 
around 
the 

literary topics, serious and 
silly alike, which mean so 
much to me.

I’m not sure where I’m 

headed on this crazy road 
called 
life, 
a 
fact 
that, 

depending on the day, can be 
both dizzyingly exhilarating 
and terribly frightening. But 
of this I am certain:

Every time I glance at the 

clock and promise myself just 
one more chapter. Every time I 
buy three new books but decide 
to reread an old one first. Every 
time I sigh in contentment at a 
perfect closing line –

I’ll be thinking of you all.

A how-to guide for 
buying festival tickets

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

The snow has melted and 

calves are cropping up every-
where. 
Questionable 
cutoff 

denim articles of clothing and 
aggressive 
long-boarders 
are 

steadily emerging from hiber-
nation. With warmer weather 
comes, 
among 
other 
things, 

concerts: annual events, pop-
up shows, world tours. In other 

words, “festival season” is upon 
us.

The festival experience is 

many things – exhilarating, mov-
ing and, at times, sticky. While 
the event itself is likely to be 
unforgettable, the equally impor-
tant pre-show process is often 
overshadowed and forgotten.

The emotional roller coaster 

that is planning for and purchas-
ing a ticket to a festival can be 
draining – the highs are high and 

the lows are low. Through care-
ful observation and the personal 
experiences of many, a distinct 
pattern of behavior, occurring in 
the months before the big event, 
has come to light. It is known as 
the Five Stages of Buying Festival 
Tickets.

1. Excitement: Categorized by 

an overall feeling of well-being, 
this phase is the easiest to get 
through, and often the longest 
lasting. Common side effects 

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Full disclaimer: I am an English 

major.

I’m the bookish oldest child 

who’s 
often 

referenced last 
in my mother’s 
conversations 
with her hospi-
tal co-workers 
when the topic 
of 
children 

comes up: “Yes, 
my college kids 
are doing well! 
My 
younger 

daughter is set on the pre-med 
track and my oldest is —” Always 
a pause. “Studying English. She 
likes to write.”

More than anything else, it’s the 

pause that gets to me. I don’t blame 
the hesitation on my mother, but 
on the environment we live in: one 
in which college is staggeringly 
expensive, where students are 
herded into STEM and business 
fields, compulsed to keep up with 
the technological race and scared 
stiff by the prospect of post-grad-
uation unemployment.

Success (and therefore money) 

seems to be a byproduct of being 
business savvy, fluent in computer 
science, 
mechanically 
detail-

oriented and charismatic enough 
to catch attention. When we 
think of billionaires, we picture 
Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark 
Zuckerberg 
— 
all 
innovative 

geniuses who molded our visions 
of technology and corporations.

In his new book, “In Defense of a 

Liberal Education,” CNN host and 
bestselling author Fareed Zakaria 
proposes that students may be 
chasing success in the wrong way. 
Funneling undergraduates into 
business, engineering and other 
trade fields may lead to a good pay-
check straight out of graduation — 
and for anxious students and their 
parents, this fact is certainly reas-
suring — but Zakaria argues that 
in our rapidly advancing world, 
the likelihood of someone hold-
ing the same job until retirement 
is outdated and obsolete. As tech-
nology evolves and corporations 

outsource more products, their 
efficiency elevates, eliminating the 
need for as many employees.

Zakaria argues that our gen-

eration is stuck at a crossroads. 
In his final chapter, “In Defense 
of Today’s Youth,” he illustrates 
common conceptions of millenni-
als: labeled as the “Me, Me, Me” 
generation, we’re obsessed with 
screens, blatantly selfish and bored 
with serious conversation. At the 
same time, Zakaria observes, we 
are diminished for being too polite 
— we’re no longer the dazed waifs 
of the ’70s or the rock punks of 
the ’80s (rebels with a cause) — 
instead, we’re generally closer to 
our parents, more conscious about 
health and the environment, moti-
vated to succeed rather than risk 
everything to make a statement.

Societal pressure, Zakaria says, 

makes career choices complicated. 
If we pursue science and technolo-
gy, our intelligence may be praised 
and rewarded, but we run the risk 
of not being able to compete cre-
atively — as Steve Jobs explained at 
the unveiling of a new iPad edition, 
“Technology alone is not enough. 
It’s technology married with liber-
al arts, married with the humani-
ties, that yields us the result that 
makes our hearts sing.”

If we choose the liberal arts, 

Zakaria says, our creative thinking 
and analytic skills may be finely 
tuned, but contrary to Jobs’ state-
ment, our degrees could be dis-
missed as “irrelevant” to future 
employers. Or even worse — a 
waste of a college education. Even 
President Barack Obama, who 
graduated from Columbia Univer-
sity with with a political science 
degree, voiced this in a 2014 speech: 
“I promise you, folks can make a 
lot more, potentially, with skilled 
manufacturing or trades than they 
make with an art history degree.”

Why do we think this way? In 

a country that steadfastly pro-
motes individualism and thrives 
on diversity, why are students pas-
sionate about art history frowned 
upon? And if our nation’s future 
success is strictly correlated with 
our advancement in math and 
science, how is it that countries 
with more rigid curricula haven’t 

passed us in innovation? Zakaria 
tries to answer these questions by 
digging into the history of liberal 
education, examining stories from 
teachers and students as well as his 
own experiences.

For Zakaria, who grew up in 

India and received a scholarship to 
attend Yale University, one thing 
is clear: “The United States has 
poorly trained labor force in gen-
eral, which is a disadvantage. But 
it makes up for it in several ways ... 
Good test scores are not enough to 
make the next Google.”

He arrived on the Yale campus 

set to pursue medicine, but instead 
graduated with a history degree. 
He was fascinated by the subject, 
stimulated by classroom debates 
and a desire to know how the 
world works — not just on the tech-
nical level, but the personal one.

“The crucial challenge (was) to 

learn how to read critically, analyze 
data, and formulate ideas — and 
most of all to enjoy the intellectual 
adventure enough to be able to do 
them easily and often,” Zakaria 
writes of his experience at Yale.

“In Defense of a Liberal Edu-

cation” emphasizes that innova-
tion doesn’t come from scientific 
advancement alone — it comes from 
human ideas, set into motion. 
Zakaria forms his defense in six 
concise chapters, walking the 
reader through a liberal education 
timeline from ancient Greek teach-
ing, through his school experience 
and to the challenges of today’s 
students. His argument draws on 
hundreds of references, detailed 
in 29 pages of citations — pulling 
quotes from scientific journals, Ivy 
League deans and corporate execu-
tives, Zakaria fleshes out his claims 
clearly and convincingly.

In the end, college is the place 

to find our passions. It’s where we 
absorb information and scheme up 
“the next big thing” in our dorm 
rooms, whether that be a social 
media phenomenon or an Oscar-
winning screenplay. We succeed 
by learning from each other, by 
collaborating our strengths and 
weaknesses. Our passions in Eng-
lish or science or Art History are 
what empower us. We shouldn’t be 
scared to admit them.

Zakaria makes the 
case for liberal arts

DAILY BOOK REVIEW

include a quickened heart rate 
and light sweat when thinking 
of the upcoming event. Thoughts 
along the lines of, “This is going 
to be the wildest, most inspiring, 
epic concert experience of my 
young life” or “I cannot believe 
I get to see *insert favorite artist 
here* in the flesh” can become 
pervasive.

2. Planning: This phase causes 

the future festival-goer to heav-
ily strategize the purchasing pro-
cedure of his/her ticket. Looking 
ahead to the date and time of the 
release, it is not uncommon for the 
subject to blow off previous engage-
ments and obligations in favor of 
securing the cheapest passes pos-
sible. Behaviors such as scoping out 
the best Wi-Fi locations and enlist-
ing friends or family to assist with 
the purchase may occur.

3. Anxiety: Though the short-

est of the five phases, the third 
is often the most stressful. It is 
in this period that the festival-
hopeful actually goes through the 
purchasing process, often causing 
increased tension and perspira-
tion. Behavior may become errat-
ic, as options such as multiple-day 
passes often sell out quickly, but 
should return to normal post-
purchase. Bargaining (with one-
self, others or a higher power) 
is common, as well as fervent 
refreshing of various web pages.

4. Post-Purchase Shock: After 

dropping what is likely to be some 
serious coin, a period of denial is 
likely to follow. Bank account bal-
ances are usually at record lows, 
causing ticket holders to rely on 
their frugality – taking on more 
shifts at work, skipping the gua-
camole at Chipotle, etc. It is pos-
sible to slip into a state of denial, 

characterized by thoughts such as, 
“If I just don’t look at my account 
balance, it’s like the money is still 
there” and “I don’t really need to 
buy food this month, anyway.” The 
duration and severity of this shock 
can vary based on the ticket hold-
er’s financial stability and emotion-
al predisposition.

5. Acceptance: With the passage 

of time, the future-festival goer is 
able to come to terms with his/her 
purchase. It is likely that the lineup 
has now been released and more 
concrete plans are being made, 
allowing him/her to return to 
their initial, excited mindset. The 
thought of the musical euphoria to 
come soothes any and all previous 
inhibitions. This period of peace 
continues up until the event, allow-
ing for full emotional closure – 
leaving the lucky music junkie free 
to take in each magical moment.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

And now we 
come to the 
sweet sorrow 
that is parting.

‘The Music Man’ 
comes to SMTD

Classic musical to 
be performed at 
Power Center

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

Sauntering about the unexpect-

edly massive lawn of the Power 
Center, I approached each door 
only to find they 
were all locked. 
One hand was 
pressing 
my 

phone to my ear 
for a daily check-
in with mom, 
the other pulling 
each door handle 
to no avail.

“Didn’t 
she 

say to use the 
stage 
door?” 

I struggled to 
remember, as I kept repeating the 
question to my mom, fully tuned 
out to whatever she had to say.

Eventually I made it to the back 

of the theater and was greeted 
by a translucent-glasses-clad lad 
exchanging cash for a presumably 
No Thai!-filled bag … two dead 
giveaways of a collegiate actor.

This year School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance is presenting 
the 
romance-tinged 
comedy 

under the direction of University 
alum Linda Goodrich, a BFA of 
the school and current associate 
professor of musical theater. The 
show is “Music Man,” which she 
considers to be the one of the best 
in musical theater.

What began as Wilson’s extraor-

dinary novel later became a staple 
of the “Golden Age of Musical The-
atre” in the late ’50s with a quirky 
script and endearing lyricism also 
crafted by Wilson. Originally pre-
miering the same season as “West 
Side Story,” “Music Man” snagged 
the Tony Award for Best Musical 
in 1957 and remains a time-hon-
ored Broadway hit.

“The Music Man” withstands 

the test of time with its quintes-
sential simplicity — a relatively 
unintellectual piece of theater 
punctuated with a unique viva-
ciousness throughout. Set in the 
early 1900s in the deep Midwest, 
the plot centers around the con-
man Harold Hill and his grand 
scheme to hoodwink the bucolic 
‘Iowa Stubborn’ townsfolk of the 
city. As a unique breed of charla-

tan, Hill’s goals aren’t initially seen 
as criminal, as he convinces them 
he will save the impressionable 
youth by way of music education 
– selling instruments and estab-
lishing a marching band within 
the city. Seduced by his charm, 
blinded by his charisma and fooled 
by his conviction, the townspeople 
succumb to his act, save an incred-
ulous librarian who — well I won’t 
give everything away.

“Didn’t Director Goodrich say 

to use the stage door?”

I followed the actor through the 

mysterious world of the backstage, 
the savory scents of his takeout 
wafted behind him, and I real-
ized I’d forgotten to eat dinner. 
As I pondered the solutions to my 
comestible conflict, I took a wrong 
turn and ended up onstage.

Between squinting into the 

lights and struggling to find my 
way, along with being rattled by 
the unexpected booming orches-
tra, I was more than a little jarred, 
amazed at how actors deliver in 
these conditions, albeit while 
singing memorized lyrics, speak-
ing memorized lines, and dancing 
choreographed movements.

In my final strong squint, I rec-

ognized Linda, and descended 
from the stage to introduce myself. 
She spoke excitedly of the show 
because, well, why wouldn’t she?

It’s been Goodrich’s big project 

since auditions began in Janu-
ary, a time when she was eager to 
assemble a cast as energetic and 
charismatic as Meredith Wilson’s 
original troupe. Congruent with 
this vision, the show also cast local 
children. Rather than attempting 
to imitate or put a unique spin on 
the show, Goodrich makes a point 
to honor and accentuate the bold 
personalities 
that 
characterize 

“Music Man.”

“We have a lot of comic char-

acters in the play, and it’s really a 
kind of specific style of comedy,” 
Goodrich said. “We were looking 
for students to handle the lan-
guage and understand the comedy 
of the period.”

She stated that the show boasts 

a full orchestra of 24, rather than 
the usual 18-member pit, which 
explained my brief stint of stage 
fright, but I kept that to myself.

Knowing she had a show to run, 

I ended our casual chat, but as I 
walked away she recommended I 
have a seat in the mezzanine (her 
preferred seating area) for its opti-
mal full-view. Sure enough, the 

theater expert was right.

As I assessed the scene, looking 

at the old-timey drop-down show-
casing detailed illustrations of key 
scenes within the show’s setting 
in River City, Iowa — the Madi-
son gymnasium, park, library, 
railroad and Main Street — I was 
transported back in time for a 
moment, a feeling that persisted 
throughout the show. I remem-
bered why I and other artistically 
attuned nerds resort back to the 
classic pieces of literature, art 
and, in this case, theater.

There’s a reason the classics 

are classic, and a reason why 
timeless 
musicals 
like 
“The 

Music 
Man” 
have 
enjoyed 

that 
distinction 
for 
nearly 

half a century. Time-honored 
mainstays of American theater, 
like “Music Man,” are ultimately 
ageless with distinct character, 
vibrant soundtrack and heart.

The show opens on a bevy of 

bachelors clad in pinstripe and 
plaid delivering knee-slap-wor-
thy puns and delightfully awk-
ward body language. It was then 
that I suddenly understood what 
Goodrich was referring to when 
she explained the show’s unique 
brand of physical comedy that is 
nearly extinct in contemporary 
theater. I found myself enticed by 
the era and enchanted by this fan-
tastically overzealous production.

For two and a half hours, I 

was captivated by the energy of 
SMTD’s “The Music Man,” and 
equally drawn to the wit of the 
period and the swagger of its 
Harold Hill. By the finale, after 
ordering Jimmy John’s at inter-
mission, I had a full stomach and 
a full appreciation for the theat-
rics of the show.

Recalling Goodrich’s favorite 

line of the show that encapsulates 
the unintentional example Hill sets 
for the townspeople of River City.

Goodrich pointed to the show’s 

message, expressed in a line by 
Harold: “You pile up enough 
tomorrows, and you’ll find you are 
left with nothing but a lot of empty 
yesterdays. I don’t know about you, 
but I’d like to make today worth 
remembering.”

After struggling to get into the 

theater, following a stereotypical 
college actor, stumbling onto the 
stage, nearly being blinded, con-
versing with Goodrich, ordering a 
sandwich and enjoying an excel-
lent production – I decided my day 
was worth remembering, too.

Jon Bellion deserves 
your full attention 

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

I have an extremely short atten-

tion span. It’s something I struggle 
with every day and causes me 
to jump from topic to topic in 
the blink of an eye. It also leaves 
me available to devote my entire 
mindset to anything that strikes 
my fancy, even if just for a short 
period of time. Today, this devo-
tion belongs to Jon Bellion.

Jonathon “Jon” Bellion was 

born and raised in Long Island, 
New Jersey and has released 
three free mixtapes since 2011. 
His most recent, The Definition, 
was released in September 2014. 
Bellion’s name may be somewhat 
unknown, but you are probably 
familiar with his work; in 2014, 
he wrote the chorus to “The Mon-
ster” by Eminem featuring Rihan-
na and co-wrote and produced the 
song “Trumpets” by Jason Derulo.

His most recent single release, 

“Woodstock 
(Psychedelic 
Fic-

tion),” continues his upward trend 
and blends the most interest-
ing parts of R&B, electronic, rap 
and hip-hop to create an entirely 
new sound. With lyrics like “She 
fell asleep during Coachella and 
she woke up here” and “They all 
dropped acid cause the time was 
right,” “Woodstock” narrates the 
ethereal experience of a music 
festival through background beat-
boxing and experimental synths.

Many of the songs on The 

Definition resonate with listen-
ers because of their authentic 
and honest lyrics. Bellion uses his 
musical platform to detail his own 
anxieties and experiences, singing 
“Eighth grade, I feel depressed as 
shit” and “Nineteen, I’m feeling 

scared as shit” in “Munny Right,” 
vocalizing the deep-seated fear 
of failure that lurks within all of 
us. He continues this theme in 
many other songs, most noticeably 
within the religious juxtaposition 
of “Human,” relaying “The pastor 
tells me I’ve been saved I’m fine / 
Then please explain to me why my 
chest still hurts.” The hook, “I’m 
just so sick of being / Human,” 
encompasses much of what Bellion 
attempts to illustrate in his mini-
malist beats.

Bellion continues to com-

ment on the grim depths of 
the artistic industry through 
creative syncopation and syn-
tax in “Jungle,” emphasizing 
the harsh underbelly of New 
York’s finest in the lines, “These 
models don’t mean soda when 
they’re offering coke / There’s 
quicksand in the nightlife, it 
will swallow you whole.” By 
minimizing production sounds 
and complicated instrumentals, 

Bellion’s verses are able to take 
the listener by the hand and 
pull him/her into a world full 
of glamorous metaphors and 
interesting insights.

While Bellion’s musical style 

is innovative and fresh in a 
musical scene that is full of rep-
etition, it is his lyrics that make 
you stop and evaluate what he 
is aiming to accomplish. With 
echoing vocals and constructed 
pulses, Bellion has set out on a 
mission to leave his own mark in 
the minds of his audience, laying 
all his cards out on the table for 
you to criticize. His introspec-
tive observations force you to 
evaluate your own hopes and 
ambitions, as well as reflect on 
where you come from and where 
your own strengths lie. It is 
music that does more than make 
you dance — it makes you think.

Jon Bellion may not have my 

attention forever, but he cer-
tainly has it right now.

Zell Writers’ Series 
to host Richard Siken

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

The Helen Zell Writers’ Program 

welcomes Richard Siken to campus 
this week. His collection, “Crush,” 
won the Yale 
Series of Young 
Poets 
Compe-

tition in 2004. 
Siken is the edi-
tor of the liter-
ary 
magazine 

spork, which he 
cofounded 
and 

has 
received 

multiple awards 
including 
the 

Literature Fellowship in Poetry 
from the National Endowment of 
the Arts, two Arizona Commission 
of the Arts grants and two Lannan 
Residency Fellowships.

For years now, the Zell Visiting 

Writers Series has brought excit-
ing and talented writers to the 
University to share their recent 
work and inspire young students 
to improve and develop their own 
writing. The weekly readings are 
held at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art, with the books 
of visiting writers available to 
purchase following the reading. 
MFA students, as well as under-
graduate English students, attend 
these weekly readings from visit-
ing writers and are encouraged to 
apply the new ideas that they have 
learned toward their own work in 
creative writing.

“It’s more co-curricular,” said 

Megan Levad, assistant director 
of the Zell Program. “The series 
not only brings renowned authors 
to Ann Arbor, but introduces MFA 
and undergraduate students to the 
work of writers they may not oth-
erwise have found on their own.”

Richard Siken, in titling his col-

lection Crush, explores all mean-
ings of the word.

“Both being crushed, and fall-

ing for someone, can feel transcen-
dent. Like one is re-made, reborn 
from the destruction,” said Levad. 
“The kind of pain that Siken writes 
of also sharpens one’s observa-
tions — everything suddenly seems 
clearer, we feel wiser, like we have 
some esoteric knowledge, can see 
through the veil.”

In her foreword to the collec-

tion, Louise Glück writes, “If panic 
is his groundnote, Siken’s obses-
sive focus is a tyrant, the body.”

Siken never wavers from com-

municating these obsessive feel-
ings through his work, weaving 
panic through his words.

“The poems in ‘Crush’ are vul-

nerable, but also precise, rigorous,” 
Levad said. “Siken invites us in 
to his emotional and intellectual 
world, and we respond.”

Siken explains the thoughts 

of panic through conflict with, 
as Glück describes, “an impec-
cable sense of timing,” and writes 
through the voice of an honest 
speaker, who explores conscious-
ness in depth, allowing readers a 

certain intimacy with the speaker.

“The blond boy in the red trunks 

is holding your head underwater / 
because he is trying to kill you / 
and you deserve it, you do, and you 
know this/and you are ready to die 
in this swimming pool / because 
you wanted to touch his hands 
and lips and this means/your life is 
over anyway / You’re in the eighth 
grade. You know these things.” 
- Siken in A Primer for the Small 
Weird Loves

Described by Glück as “lines 

that predict and summarize a life,” 
Siken uses inconsistency and inter-
connectedness to demonstrate the 
daring, but beautiful elements of 
his collection.

“I think the realization that 

writing is something that real, live 
people who come to campus and 
eat lunch and visit classes and sign 
books do can make a world of dif-
ference in young writers’s beliefs 
in the possibilities for their own 
work,” Levad said.

Students are encouraged to 

attend this event by the UM Eng-
lish Department and enjoy Siken’s 
reading of his extraordinary col-
lection filled with power and driv-
en by an obsession and panic that 
critics have claimed “makes this 
one of the best books of contempo-
rary poetry.”

Siken’s question and answer ses-

sion will be held at 2:00 PM, 4/16 
in the Hopwood Room, his reading 
following at 5:00 PM in the UMMA 
Helmut Stern Auditorium.

Albrecht talks recovery process

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It’s still early, but so far, Spike 

Albrecht’s recovery is well on 
track.

After playing with a fractured 

bone and torn labrum for most 
of the season, Albrecht had 
surgery last week on his right hip. 
And as he hobbled into Crisler 
Center for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s annual awards 
celebration, the junior guard 
showed off a contraption that’s 
keeping his hipbone properly 
aligned while he rehabs.

But that’s not to say the process 

has gone without a hiccup.

“The first two to three days 

after surgery were terrible,” 
Albrecht said. “Just with it being 
my first surgery, I think with 
the whole anesthesia and stuff. 
But I’m feeling really good right 
now. I’m able to get up on my 
own, crutch around. I was in bed 
forever, it felt like.”

Despite 
doctors’ 
advice, 

Albrecht couldn’t keep himself 
from feeding his appetite after 
surgery.

“With the anesthesia, I tried 

eating too much, I think the first 
or second day,” Albrecht said. 
“The doctors told me, ‘you’re 
gonna be hungry, but don’t eat.’ 
And I was like, ‘What does that 
mean? If I’m hungry, I’m gonna 
eat.’ And sure enough, I got sick 
as a dog for the first couple days. 
So that was brutal.”

But otherwise, he has been 

able to get back into his routine, 
albeit aided by crutches and the 
thigh contraption.

And with crutches in tow, the 

rising senior guard cleaned up at 
the team’s award ceremony.

Albrecht split the Bill Buntin 

Most Valuable Player award with 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin. 
He also won the Steve Grote 
Hustle Award and Thad Garner 
Leadership Award for himself.

He also took home the Gary 

Grant Award, given to the 
player with the most assists — 
he finished the season with 121, 
nearly four per game.

Whereas 
other 
award 

recipients went 
up 
on 
stage 

to 
pose 
for 

pictures 
with 

their plaques, 
the 
coaches 

presenting 
Albrecht’s 
awards 
implored him 
to stay seated, 
resting his legs 
and letting the 
hardware come to him.

With a recovery timetable that 

he hopes will put him back on the 
court in late September, he’ll have 
to adjust to taking a step back 
from the action.

“It stinks,” Albrecht said. “I’m 

gonna miss probably the whole 
summer, most of the offseason, 
which is tough.”

His recovery plan could be 

complicated a bit by an additional 
procedure to his other hip, which 

he also injured during the season.

The 
surgery 
he 
already 

underwent 
involved 
three 

incisions: two to shave down his 
hip bone and socket and another 

to repair his 
labrum.

If 
he 
has 

the 
second 

surgery, which 
would 
occur 

sometime 
in 
May, 
he 

expects 
the 

procedure 
would 
be 

similar. 
Whether 

he gets it or not, Albrecht is 
confident he will make a full 
recovery, in part because he has 
seen the effects of this type of 
operation before.

Senior forward Max Bielfeldt 

had hip surgery last spring, 
and Albrecht has been using 
his recovery process to gauge 
whether he would.

“I’ve said this all season: Max 

was the guinea pig,” Albrecht said. 
“I wasn’t ready to go do it myself. 

I wanted to see how he recovered 
and all that. He was telling me 
from … a few weeks out, he could 
tell it was such a big difference. 
You could tell last year.”

Bielfeldt rode his recovery to a 

career year that saw him average 
15 minutes per game and earn the 
team’s Sixth Man Award.

And 
from 
a 
surgeon’s 

perspective, Albrecht was even 
easier to operate on.

“(The doctor) said it went 

really good,” Albrecht said. “I 
think the fact that I’m smaller 
helps, so he said my surgery was 
easier than Max’s, cause Max’s 
legs are like tree trunks trying to 
move those things around.”

With one successful surgery 

complete, and another potentially 
on the way, Albrecht is laying low 
right now. Fortunately for him, 
his time away from the court 
coincides with his roommate, 
Caris LeVert, returning to good 
health. LeVert got his walking 
boot off Tuesday.

“I chauffeured him around 

a lot,” Albrecht said. “He’s got 
some payback.”

LeVert mulls 
draft decision

Junior will ask for 
a second evaluation 
from Undergraduate 
Advisory Committee

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Caris LeVert “probably will 

have a decision pretty soon” 
regarding his declaration for 
the 2015 NBA Draft.

With the NBA Draft early 

entry 
eligibility 
deadline 

quickly approaching on April 
26, the junior guard is still 
deliberating and evaluating all 
the available information he can 
get before making up his mind.

After previously submitting 

for an evaluation from the 
NBA Undergraduate Advisory 
Committee following the end 
of the regular season, LeVert 
and 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein recently resubmitted for 
another assessment.

The 
fact 
that 
37 

underclassmen have declared 
for the draft will most likely 
sway 
LeVert 

toward 
coming 
back 

for his senior 
year, 
but 

other 
factors 

will certainly 
contribute as 
well.

For 
one, 

LeVert is still 
recovering 
from surgery 
on his left foot. He just got his 
boot off Tuesday, but there’s a 
still long way to go before he is 
up to full speed.

“But I still have a ways 

before I can start running and 
jumping,” LeVert said. “Going 
out 
there 
tomorrow 
would 

probably be a stretch. … But 
I don’t have to do that. The 
combine isn’t tomorrow. I still 
have a couple more weeks to go. 
Hopefully in a couple weeks I’ll 
feel a little bit better.”

Additionally, 
LeVert 

admitted Wednesday night that 
if the second evaluation reveals 
he would likely be a second-
round pick, he would most 
likely come back to school.

“I don’t think it really makes 

sense to go early and be drafted 
in the second round,” he said.

When 
the 
NBA 

Undergraduate 
Advisory 

Committee lets Beilein and 
LeVert know how many players 
are ranked ahead of LeVert, 
forming an analysis off such a 
projection is pretty simple.

And while projections will 

certainly be a factor in LeVert’s 
ultimate decision, there’s still 
plenty of pros and cons that will 
play into his final choice.

“Another thing is, I love 

playing here,” LeVert said. “So 
that would definitely be tough 
to walk away from, if that’s the 
decision I decide to make. But 
like you said, going out on a high 
note would be really good, too.”

With Wednesday marking 

the final day of the NBA regular 
season, the rest of the team’s 
draft order outside of the lottery 
will be known. Because of that, 
Beilein will know what teams 
will pick in the latter end of the 
first round and which scouting 
directors and general managers 
he can talk to on LeVert’s behalf.

The process of whether to 

enter has been long for LeVert. 
But because the issue is “a good 
problem to have,” he hasn’t 
found it to be very distracting.

LeVert 
figures 
he’s 
done 

enough 
to 

prove 
his 

capability 
in 

the NBA from 
his sophomore 
year and the 
beginning 
of his junior 
campaign. 
But 
at 
the 

same time, he 
knows the foot 
injury is still a 

lingering issue.

With 
the 
NBA 
Draft 

Combine taking place from 
May 12 to May 17 and resulting 
individual workouts to follow, 
it’s 
still 
unclear 
whether 

LeVert will be back to full 
health to take part in both or 
either activity.

“I would definitely want to 

(be back at 100 percent), but I 
don’t know if I’ll be able to (by 
then),” LeVert said.

In 
the 
meantime, 
he’ll 

continue to go to class, stay low 
and play the waiting game. He’s 
not going to allow the decision 
to stress him out.

“I can’t really make a bad 

decision.”

Same process, 
different day
for Christner

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — In the 

top of the fourth inning, the 
Michigan softball team was 
firmly in the drivers’ seat of 
its 
in-state 
rivalry 
matchup 

with Michigan State, boasting 
a six-run lead. It appeared the 
Wolverines (11-2 Big Ten, 38-6 
overall) were already capable of 
simply coasting to a victory.

But sophomore left fielder 

Kelly Christner stepped up to the 
plate with other ideas. Maybe she 
wanted to get back to Ann Arbor 
early.

The 
bases 

were 
loaded. 

She 
patiently 

drew 
a 
full 

count, waiting 
for her pitch. 
And she got it.

Christner 

put the nail in the coffin of a 
dominant 10-0 run-rule victory 
over the Spartans (1-12, 16-26), 
roping a ball over the right-field 
fence for her second home run 
of the game and leaving no doubt 
on the diamond of who was the 
superior team Wednesday.

Despite the fans’ tendency 

to exaggerate the importance 
of a rivalry victory, Christner 
was quick to acknowledge it as a 
normal game.

“It’s just great to keep working 

towards our goal,” Christner 
said. “But as a specific game, 
it’s not any more special than 
another one.”

Christner’s first home run 

came in the top of the fourth 
inning when she sent a ball 
soaring to right field out of 
Secchia Stadium.

Things could have been even 

more lopsided in the Wolverines’ 
favor if Christner had some 
luck to go with her talented 
performance. In the top of the 

first inning, Christner nearly had 
a two-run homer to put Michigan 
on the board almost immediately, 
but it was robbed by the right 
fielder at the wall.

Though Christner put on a 

display of eye-popping power 
hitting, that wasn’t necessarily 
the Wolverines’ strategy entering 
the game on Wednesday.

“We scouted them, and their 

outfielders play right up against 
the wall,” Christner said. “So our 
game plan was to try to hit line 
drives and gappers to drop into 
the outfield.”

“I guess I failed at that,” she 

added with a 
smile.

Christner 

clearly 
established 
herself 
as 

the 
contest’s 

offensive 
juggernaut, 

going 2-for-3 with five RBI, three 
runs and a walk. She was a part 
of a lineup that forced three 
pitching changes and drew seven 
walks.

So far this season, Christner 

has more than quadrupled her 
home run total from last year. 
She has already surpassed her hit 
total from the 2014 campaign.

And the sophomore has shown 

no signs of slowing down lately. 
In the past five games, Christner 
has posted 14 RBI.

“She’s just really doing a 

great job of seeing the ball,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“When you see the ball (well), 
obviously your chances of hitting 
it goes up. And I think she’s 
confident.”

Added junior second baseman 

Sierra Romero: “Same thing, 
different day for her. She’s 
doing awesome right now. I’m 
really proud of her in that three 
spot right now because she’s 
absolutely killing it.”

served 
as 

warning signs early on for the 
Michigan 
softball 
team. 
But 
the 

Wolverines quickly turned the 
game around behind sophomore 
right-handed 
pitcher 
Megan 

Betsa’s hot hand and sophomore 
outfielder 
Kelly 
Christner’s 

powerful bat.

Wednesday, 
after 
two 

scoreless innings in which they 
stranded three batters, it seemed 
like the Wolverines would have 
a slow day in the batter’s box. 
That lasted until a five-run third 
inning put Michigan (11-2 Big 
Ten, 38-6 overall) on track for a 
10-0 mercy-rule victory over the 
Spartans (1-12, 16-26) at Secchia 
Stadium.

Junior centerfielder Sierra 

Lawrence knocked a steady 
pitch into shallow left field to 
start the contest, and the next 
three batters hit rockets deep 
to the outfield, but all were all 
caught, leaving Lawrence out to 
dry in scoring position.

The second inning was much 

of the same. Despite a few walks, 
shallow pop-ups and base hits, 
the Wolverines could not bring 
anyone home. And then the 
inning changed one more time.

In the top of the third, while 

junior 
Sierra 
Romero 
was 

stealing second, the catcher’s 
throw sailed over the shortstop’s 
glove, 
allowing 
Romero 
to 

advance to third. After walking 
sophomore 
Kelly 
Christner, 

Michigan State pulled starting 
left-handed pitcher Bridgette 
Rainey.

The newcomer, right-hander 

Dani Goranson, sent her first 
pitch well over the catcher’s 
head, and Romero stole home, 
chalking the first run of the day.

The rest poured on from 

there.

Goranson returned to the 

circle in the fourth inning, 
but her outing didn’t last long. 
Christner crushed a 1-2 delivery 
over the right-field wall for the 
solo homer and the sixth run of 
the day. When Goranson walked 
the next batter, the Spartans 
changed pitchers again. Valerie 
Kaff entered the circle and 
forced a pop-up and strikeout 
to rescue the Spartans from any 
more damage.

While 
pitching 
was 
a 

hindrance for Michigan State, it 
was the opposite for its in-state 
rival. In the circle, Betsa threw a 
five-inning no-hitter, posting six 
strikeouts and just one walk.

“She stayed in her moment,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “When she didn’t 
have some good pitches, she 
came back and stayed with 
the process. The game is not 
over until it’s over, and if it’s a 
no-hitter, great. When you stay 
in the process, the outcomes 
happen. If you focus on a 
no-hitter, chances are you won’t 
have it.”

Added Betsa: “I was just 

coming out to here to do my part 
and put the fewest amount of 
runs on the board. Getting ahead 
of hitters and cutting down on 
walks was also nice to see.”

In the top of the fifth, 

Michigan State’s pitcher loaded 
the bases with no outs for 
Christner. She stepped up to the 
plate again, and just like her last 
appearance, launched a grand 
slam over the right-field wall. 
Now 10 runs ahead, Michigan 
needed just a three-out inning 
from Betsa to reel in the road 
victory.

Christner’s 
two 
homers 

brought in five batters total, 
good for half of Michigan’s runs.

After a groundout and infield 

pop-up, there was one out left 
for the struggling Spartans. 
With a 1-2 count, Betsa fired in 
the final pitch as catcher Ellie 
Stoffer struck out swinging, 
bringing the game to a close.

BASEBALL
Michigan unable to find offensive spark

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

After 
walloping 
Eastern 

Michigan last week, the Michi-
gan baseball team headed into 
Wednesday’s rematch at Ray 
Fisher Sta-
dium with 
its 
sights 

set 
on 

another midweek win.

But the Eagles had other plans, 

topping the Wolverines, 4-2.

Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 21-16 

overall) relied on a group effort 
on the mound, using a total of 
seven pitchers on the evening. 
Just three of those seven gave 
up earned runs, but the Big Ten’s 
best offense was unable to pick up 
the slack and push Michigan over 
the top.

“We knew it was going to be 

one of those days where a lot of 
guys could get their names called, 
and it just so happened that today 
we had to match up our pitch-
ers with their offense and try to 
minimize as best we could,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“With the exception of the begin-
ning and the end, we put up some 
zeroes in the middle. With our 
lack of offense and ability to score 
today, it just wasn’t enough.”

The Eagles (4-8 Mid-American 

Conference, 14-23 overall) put 
numbers on the board first, push-
ing single runs across in the first 
and third innings. They jumped 
on Wolverine right-hander Keith 
Lehmann in the top of the first, 
scoring once and loading the 
bases with two outs, but the 
junior was able to get out of the 

jam, allowing only one run.

Lehmann didn’t return to the 

mound for the second inning and 
was replaced by right-hander 
Jayce Vancena. The freshman 
worked a perfect top of the sec-
ond, but ran 
into trouble in 
the third. East-
ern 
Michigan 

capitalized on 
a leadoff single 
from 
second 

baseman John 
Rubio, 
who 

then stole sec-
ond and scored 
on a triple off the right-field wall. 
Vancena then gave way to senior 
right-hander Donnie Eaton, who 
induced two groundouts to end 
the Eagle threat.

Eastern 
Michigan’s 
Kyle 

Huckaby held Michigan hitless 
through three innings, before 
freshman shortstop Jake Bivens 
singled to right field to lead off 
the bottom of the fourth. Huck-
aby hit junior third baseman 

Travis Maezes 
with a pitch, 
putting 
two 

runners 
on 

base with no 
outs for Michi-
gan left fielder 
Carmen Bene-
detti, 
who 

leads the Big 
Ten 
in 
RBI. 

The sophomore came through, 
delivering a run-scoring single 
to right field, pulling the Wolver-
ines to within one run of tying 
the game.

Michigan continued the pres-

sure, eventually pushing across 
the tying run in the bottom of the 
sixth inning.

Sophomore right fielder John-

ny Slater led the inning with a 
double to the right-field corner 
and moved to third base off a sin-
gle from senior first baseman Kyle 
Jusick. Senior designated hitter 
Dominic Jamett eventually hit 
into a double play, bringing Slater 
home from third to knot the score 
at 2-2.

After the Wolverines threat-

ened once again in the bottom 
of the eighth, Eastern Michigan 
broke through in its last at-bats. 
Shortstop David Lett started 
things off with a one-out infield 
single, which preceded a double 
to the left-field corner by right 
fielder Jordan Peterson to put 
two runners in scoring position 

for the Eagles with only one out.

The next batter up was Rubino, 

who tripled to center field for his 
fifth hit of the game to put East-
ern Michigan on top, 4-2. The 
top of the Wolverine lineup went 
down in order in the ninth.

Wednesday’s loss marked the 

second in a row for Michigan 
after they fell to Michigan State 
on Tuesday night.

“(The lack of offensive pro-

duction) is frustrating because 
it hasn’t been our issue,” Bakich 
said. “We’ve been able to score 
and score in multiple innings this 
year, and this just hasn’t been our 
(week). That happens in base-
ball. You have some peaks and 
valleys, and hopefully this is just 
some little team valley and we 
can rebound and get right back 
on top.”
