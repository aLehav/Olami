Reports find uptick
in the popularity of
some narcotics
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Editor's Note: Names denot-
ed with an asterisk have been
changed to protect the identities of
the individuals.
Marijuana may be the only
drutg that gets its own festial
each year, butt it's certainly not
the only drug used on campus.
Over the last decade, the Uni-
versity has seen an increase in
the prevalence of harder drugs,
specifically prescription stimuz
lants and ecstasy, while drugs
like heroin threaten to boom in
the near future.
University Police Chief Robert
Neumann, who has been with
the department since 1985, said
he believes drug abuse on cam-
pus is a problem, and one that has
worsened in his time at the Uni-
versity.

"We have seen an increase
in hard drugs here," Neumann
said. "I've seen more than a few
(instances) in the last three or
four years. It's not trending in a
good direction when it comes to
serious, hard drugs."
"Prescription drug abuse has
been a problem for a number of
years," he added. "But I'm see-
ing more and more of the kind of
drugs that we haven't seen in a
very long time - certainly in my
career."
Steve,* a juniot who claims to
deal "THC-related" drugs - or
drugs containing marijuana - to
nearly 40 monthly clients, said
he doesn't believe marijuana is
the most common drug at the
Uniyersity.
"If you count Adderall, Ritalin
and that kind of thing, prescrip-
tion drugs are by far number
one," he said. "There are lots of
people who won't touch weed
and don't like the feeling and
they have no problem taking
some Adderall or Ritalin."

Rejected high school
students partner

Daily News Editor
Chants of "they say 'Jim'
Crowe,' we say, 'hell no,' "
echoed across campus for the

second time this semester as
By Any Means Necessary part-
nered with Michigan high
school students to protest the
University's admissions process.
Protesters flooded the Stu-
dent Activities Building, con-
gregating in both the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions on
the first floor and then the office
of Financial Aid upstairs. The
group held signs, shouted chants
and gave speeches criticizing
the University's admission pro-

cess for not doing enough to
increase minority enrollment.
Four students were high-
lighted in the protest, and each
of whom were rejected by the
University this year despite
having what they believed were
strong applications. Brooke
Kimbrough from University
Prep Academy High School in
Detroit, Daisha Martin from
Seaholm High School in Bir-
mingham, and Alfredo Aguirre
and Mario Martinez, both from

Cass Technical High School in
Detroit, spoke through mega-
phones in the Office of Admis-
sions, sharing stories of their
work leading up to applying to
college and their subsequent
denial to the University.
The students said the Uni-
versity is not accommodating
the difference in opportuni-
ties between white and minor-
ity students applying to college.

NBA BOUND

After months of
dialogue, new
initiatives to take
aim at seven demands
ByYARDAIN AMRON
and CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporters
Since the University's Black
Student Union staged a protest
on the steps of Hill Auditorium
in January, student organizers
and administrators have met
regularly to discuss the group's
seven demands aimed at increas-
ing equity and diversity on cam-
pus.
The University released a
preliminary report Wednes-
day detailing concrete progress
regarding the group's demands
for facility improvements and
access to historical documents,
but left other issues like increas-
ing underrepresented minority
enrollment and altering Race &
Ethnicity requirements largely
up to further study.
Discontent with the state of

campus diversity and inclusion
was brought to the forefront
after a series of racially-charged
incidents sparked the Being
Black at University of Michigan
Twitter campaign, which the
BSU launched in November.
Black enrollment at the Uni-
versity has dropped from 7.2
percent to 4.65 percent since
the passage of Proposal 2, the
2006 Michigan ballot proposal
that banned the consideration of
race inthe admissions process of
public institutions.
BSU representatives and
administrators have met week-
ly since January to discuss the
prospects of increasing under-
represented minority enroll-
ment, as well as exploring the
availability of emergency funds,
improvements to the Trotter
Multicultural Center and cam-
pus transportation.
In the release, the Univer-
sity addressed each of the BSU's
demands, as well as the result-
ing policy initiatives or changes
that have resulted or are in the
works.

GW student spits on police

The GW Hatchet reported
that a male George Washington
student allegedly spit on a Uni-
versity Police Department offi-
cer after a minor confrontation.
After refusing to pay his cab
fare, the student confronted
the cab driver outside the car.
The University Police Depart-
ment witnessed the confron-
tation and attempted to break
it up, only to be spit on by the
student.
George Washington Uni-
versity spokeswoman Mara-
lee Csellar said the student
"seemed intoxicated" and was
first sent to the GW Hospital
for treatment before his arrest.

DRUGS
From Page 1A
are popular both as study aides
and party drugs, other substances
are growing in popularity. Steve
said acid is a popular experimen-
tal drug that students may try at
least once. In early April, a Uni-
versity officer discovered what
appeared to be a rock of metham-
phetamine during a routine traf-
fic stop.
The University deals with very
few incidents of illegal drug pos-
session internally. In its annual
report, the Office of Student Con-
flict Resolutions reported only 10
incidents of illegal drug posses-
sion for the 2012-2013 academic
year, all of which were cases of
marijuana. During a spike in
overall illegal drug possession
incidents between the 2010-2011
and 2011-2012 academic years
- which dealt with 26 and 24
reported incidents, respectively
- there were only two reports of
heroin and one of ecstasy.
OSCR Director Jay Wilgus said
the number of violations of the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities may not reflect
increased or fluctuating drug
consumption, but rather the level
of enforcement in the community
for a particular year.
Accurate statistics about stu-
dent drug use are difficult to
collect. The University relies
on the Internet-based Student
Life Survey administered by the
Institute for Research on Women
and Gender and the Substance
Abuse Research Center to gain
an understanding of what portion
of the population is using which
drugs and how many.
Since 2003, the survey reports
that the use of prescribed stimu-
lants for non-medical use has
risen between 5.4 to 9.3 percent.
Wolverine Wellness Director
Mary Jo Desprez said that drug
trends are often associated with
perception of risk: When the
perception of risk of a drug goes
down, usage goes up; when the
perception of risk goes up, the
use goes down. This public health
model may explain the rise in pre-
scription drug abuse over the last
decade or more.
"Twenty years ago you didn't
see commercials about any drug
ever," Desprez said. "I would say
prescription medications in gen-
eral are much more marketed."
Desprez said wide availability
may also contribute to the rising
trend in prescription drug abuse.
"You don't really need a drug
dealer," she said. "You need a
medicine cabinet in someone's
apartment."
5.1 percent of male students
and 4.8 of females taking the Stu-
dent Life Survey reported using
ecstasy - and/or MDMA, collo-
quially known as Molly - in the
past year, an uptick from the 2.8
and 1.7 percent, respectively, that
reported using the drug in 2011.
In that time, ecstasy went from
being the seventh most-used drug
on campus to the third.
Desprez said increases should
not be made into a bigger problem
than the data shows, especially
considering that drug use num-
bers beyond marijuana, accord-
ing to the Student Life Survey,

fall below 10 percent. At the same
time, she said all drug use is wor-
thy of the University's "awareness
and attention."
With regards to ecstasy and
Molly, she said the slow upward
trend could be attributed to a
similar decrease in perceived
risk that led to an increase in
prescription drug use. But for

ecstasy, she said the change in
perception can be traced to a cul-
tural narrative closely tied to the
music scene.
At the same time, usage of
drugs like heroin and cocaine
display no clear trend on campus
within the last decade. Cocaine
was reportedly used by 4.4 per-
cent of men and 2.6 percent of
women sampled in the 2013 sur-
vey, an increase from 3.8 percent
of men and 1.2 percent of women
sampled in 2011. According to
the 2013 survey, heroin was only
used by 0.3 percent of the student
population.
Prof. Lloyd Johnston, who
teaches in the Institute for Social
Research and co-authored of the
Monitoring the Future survey - a
government-sponsored report on
adolescent drug use from 1975 to
2008 - said nationally, levels of
cocaine use are currently low.
Amphetamines like Adderall
are the most-used drugnationally
among college students, which
has risen in the past three or four
years. Johnston said Molly is so
new that it was not included on
the 2013 survey.
He added that though heroin
use is not particularly significant
overall within the national sur-
vey, there are heroin problems
in certain localities across the
nation.
While the University's campus
is not currently one of these areas,
many states, including Michigan,
are experiencing an increase in
heroin use.
According to data collected
by the Michigan Department of
Community Health, deaths due
to heroin overdose increased in
Michigan from 271 between 1999
and 2002, to 728 between 2010
and 2012. The number of people
admitted for heroin addiction
treatment rose from 6,500 in
2002 to 13,600 in 2013.
Desprez said heroin has not
affected the University as much
because there is still a high per-
ception of risk, as well as punish-
ment.
"The penalties are a lot differ-
ent," she said. "You get caught
with a beer standing outside of a
party - and you get caught with
heroin? Really different."
People often turn to heroin
after abusing opiates like Vicodin,
Percocet and Codeine because
tolerance to those drugs develops
quickly.
"You need more and more
to get the same desired effect,"
Desprez said. "That gets to be
pretty expensive if you're buying
it. And if someone says, 'well her-
oin's really cheap and more pow-
erful,' you can see how (turning to
heroin) is goingto happen."
Since the 1990s, heroin has
become much cheaper and more
potent.
Taylor* - a freshman who
claimed to drinks at least two
times a week, uses cocaine or
Molly once a week and deals to
20 off-and-on clients - said the
transition to heroin can be dan-
gerously easy.
"You can buy a dose of heroin
for ten bucks, $5 if you don't have a
drug tolerance," he said. "Where-
as the same high for Vicodin and
Oxi would cost you probably $20
for Vicodin - which wouldn't
be as good - and Oxi, which is

almost the same, for almost 80
bucks."
Heroin is now coming in a
cleaner cut than it ever has before.
It can be taken without a needle
- something that traditionally
drove many potential users away.
Relatively pure heroin is available
to smoke or inhale rather than
inject.

"You can smoke it too," he said.
"If you get black tar heroin you
can smoke it and you can inject
black tar. And if you get china
white, which is the powder, you
can snort that or you can inject
that."
Taylor agreed with the num-
bers presented by the University's
Student Life Survey regardingthe
low frequency of heroin use. He
also agreed with the slight rise in
Molly usage and, especially, the
increase in students abusing pre-
scription drugs.
"People feel more comfortable
around prescription drugs, espe-
cially Adderall," he said. "People
think of it as a study aid, but if
you crush that shit up, it's a party
drug."
Taylor said he sells cocaine,
Molly, LSD and some prescrip-
tion drugs. Four of his clients
purchase drugs from him in
greater quantities and re-sell it
to people within their fraterni-
ties. Though he said the use of
harder drugs on campus is mini-
mal, any upward trend could be
attributed to the perception of
marijuana at large.
"Now that the weed culture is
becoming more relaxed, people
are coming into contact with it
more and therefore more people
are questioning if everything is
just as bad," he said. "And I would
like to say everything is not all
bad."
Desprez said identifying a
geographic pattern of drug use
applicable to social demograph-
ics - dorms, Greek Life and off
campus, among other areas - is
difficult to determine because the
University sees so much turnover
in student life.
"One floor can have a heavy
party reputation one year and
then the next year, a whole
bunch of new folks move in,"
she said. "That's true about
athletics teams. I think that's
true about a Greek house. But
does one have enough years of
that reputation that it starts to
recruit people?"
Jane*, a freshman who claimed
to have experimented with sev-
eral drugs, said her impression is
that the Residential College has
more drug use than the average
dorm, and most drug use is not
happening in Greek Life.
LSA junior Tommy Wydra,
president of the Interfraternity
Council, said that there is not a
drug problem within Greek Life
at the University.
"Based on what I've seen it's no
where near as prevalent as it is at
other campuses," Wydra said.
He added that most drug-abuse
incidents and prevention plans
are handled internally by indi-
vidual fraternities, though avoid-
ing the illegal use of prescription
drugs is part of the IFC's sober
monitoring training program.
Chief Neumann said that drug
prevention is difficult because
it requires follow-ups that can't
occur simply because someone is
in possession of a pill bottle.
"It takes leg work," he said. "It
does take investigation and it's
certainly not easy to do."
Neumann said the drug prob-
lem is not necessarily limited to
students, calling it "a broader
problem within our society."
However, not everyone agrees

with this assertion.
"There are a lot of false things
about how everyone who uses
them is automatically a bad
person," Jane said. "I'm not
addicted to anything. I know
that there's a lot of negative ste-
reotypes about people who use
them but I've had straight A's
this semester."

Mark Fancher, ACLU of Michigan Racial Justice staff attorney, discusses affirmative action at Rackham Amphitheater
Tuesday.

history of affirmative action,
explaining how the University
played a role in the history of
affirmative action through 2003
U.S. Supreme Court cases Grut-
ter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bol-
linger.
During his lecture, Fancher
said affirmative action serves a
role in providing minority stu-
dents, who have different life and
cultural experiences than white
students do, an opportunity to
share their stories in an educa-
tional setting and enhance the
overall community culture.
Fancher said this preferential
treatment like that used in affir-
mative action is given to athletes,
children of donors to the Univer-
sity and instate residents with-
out the same resistance as with
minority students.
He ended his lecture by dis-
cussing the recent jurisdiction
over Proposal 2, a Michigan
initiative on the 2006 ballot to
end affirmative action in public
schools that passed with a major-
BAMN

typically white students are bet-
ter able to prepare for the college
curriculum while students from
families with lower socioeco-
nomic statuses work just as hard
without the same payoff.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director of
undergraduate admissions, lis-
tened to the students' concerns,
who insistedtheUniversityneed-
ed to be more active in admit-
ting minority students. Students
asked Spencer to explain exactly
why they weren't admitted, even
chanting for Spencer to show
them their files.
Kimbrough, who is currently
a high school senior, has a GPA
of 3.5 and an ACT score of 23 out
of the possible 36. These scores
are below the average scores of
the Fall 2013 freshman class in
which students' GPA averaged
3.85 and ACT scores ranged from
29 to 33.
Still, Kimbrough has served
as the executive director of her
school's National Honors Society
Chapter, of which she is now the
president, and has worked with
the Alternative for Girls non-
profit organization, which aids
at-risk youth. Additionally, this
past weekend, she and her debate
team won the Urban Debate
National Championship.
Kimbrough said she was given
a deferred admission decision
after applying early action and
subsequently denied admission
- a decision she felt was unfair
given her level of academic and
extracurricular success through-

ity vote. ACLU attorneys recently
opposed Michigan Attorney
General Bill Schuette in court,
saying that a majority-passing
legislature that disenfranchises
a minority group is discrimina-
tory and unconstitutional. Fur-
thermore, the fact that students
of color must first appeal to the
political system before they can
lobby University admissions cre-
ates unnecessary burdens on
those students.
"It's inherently on its face
unfair, and certainly it's uncon-
stitutional," Fancher said. "And
that's the very basis of the law-
suit that is before the court right
now."
LSA junior Connor Caplis,
the chair of the ACLU Under-
graduate Chapter, said the tim-
ing of the event was appropriate
after the recent #BBUM media
demonstration organized by the
Black Student Union and other
efforts minority students took to
express the lack of diversity this
past year.
"I think there are a lot of mis-
conceptions about affirmative
action," Caplis said. "Prop.2 had a
lot of problematic messaging that
out high school.
"It frustrates me when I'm
actually trying to do something,
bring this over to the University
and show them that, 'Yes, you
can still come from this kind
of area with one parent at that
home and not a lot of money com-
ingin every year, but you can still
be somebody,'" she said.
Aguirre and Martinez said
another major issue at their high
school is money, noting the Uni-
versity's tuition costs were too
high for their families to afford.
They said the price of tuitiontyp-
ically discourages students from
applying with the knowledge
they would not be able to attend
even if they were admitted.
"It's demoralizing how they
pretty much give you the bait and
take it away; they're just playing
with you," Aguirre said. "I felt
the same way. Even if I'm able to
get in, what is the point because I
can't pay for it?"
As the BAMN protesters left
the student activities building,
Spencer had a candid conver-
sation with Martin about the
admissions process as others in
the lobby looked on. Martin told
Spencer about her work outside
of class, such as starting a Black
student union and working with
various other volunteering and
community outreach work.
Martin tried to appeal to her
and Spencer's shared race as
Black individuals, asking him
to, "look at the color of his skin,"
sayingthat he should understand
the added difficulties many
minority students face when
applying to schools.
"I've changed my commu-
nity," she told Spencer. "You've

said minority students were get-
ting preferential treatment when
in reality that's not true, no one
is gaining any preferential treat-
ment from this policy."
Many students came out to
hear Fancher speak, including
LSA freshman Kiaura Clark.
After going to a diverse high
school, she said she felt an almost
"anti-culture shock" upon arriv-
ing at the University due to its
lack of diversity.
She added that she came to
the event because she has a dif-
ficult time having educated con-
versations with students who
disagree with affirmative action,
both because it is an emotionally
charged issue and because of gen-
eral ignorance surrounding its
history.
"It's very helpful to hear a
breakdown of what exactly
affirmative action is because
a lot of time people who have
these debates aren't educat-
ed," Clark said. "I like hearing
the reasons again just so when
I'm communicating with other
students, I have even more
knowledge that I can add to the
conversation."
denied me admissions, and I've
already done what you're trying
to teach your kids here to do."
Still, Spencer told both Martin
and the group at large that the
University is highly selective,
and even students who excel in
certain areas may not have the
strongest overall application to
be accepted.
Spencer rejected the accusa-
tion that the University does not
do enough to bring in minority
students. Despite the elimina-
tion of affirmative action poli-
cies following the passage of
Proposal 2 in 2006, Spencer
said the admissions office still
uses a holistic approach to stu-
dent admissions. The Office of
Admissions evaluates each indi-
vidual applicant on academic
experiences, student essays, let-
ters of recommendation, extra-
curricular experiences and
socioeconomic profile, among
other considerations.
"We look at everything that
we can to try to figure out how
could this student be success-
ful at Michigan and would it be
a good fit," Spencer said. "We'll
put our record up against any
school in the country. I talk to
my friends at Stanford and at
Princeton; they both say we use
the same process to evaluate stu-
dents."
As for the rejected high school
students, they said they plan to
continue working toward admit-
tance despite being admitted to
other colleges. BAMN organiz-
ers said the group plans to hold
another protest next week and
will likely bring more students
who were not accepted to the
University.

dent fee. The fee has notrisen from
its current rate, $7.19, since 2005.
The resolution reads: "Contin-
gent upon approval of the fee limit
increase by the Board of Regents,
the Assembly supports raising the
Central Student Government fee
to the maximum limit approvedby
the student body and the Board of
Regents."
Business senior Michael

Proppe, former CSG president,
said in a presentation to the assem-
bly that the fee, which is the CSG's
primary source of funding, could
even be raised by $2.81 to an even
10 dollars.
Proppe said raising the fee
would only increase tuition .015
percent, compared to a 32 percent
increase in CSG revenue that could
be used to aid student organiza-
tions- a goal that was impeded
this year by lower enrollment and
less "carry forward" funds from
past administrations.

Business senior Eric Kibler,
CSG treasurer, added that CSG's
recently updated policy of pro-
viding rolling applications, three
times each semester, for student
organizations seeking funding has
increased the use of funds, which
drains the budget more quickly.
Hence, a larger budget could help
meet the needs of more student
organizations.
"We have more organizations
applying for more money. We are
actually awarding more money
to organizations," Proppe said.

"The carry forward has come way
down. We have an average of 260K
per year in the old system com-
pared to 40K now"
According to a campus poll sent
out by the CSG last week, 60 per-
cent of the 2,000 student respon-
dents support the $2 increase,
whereas 50.19 percent favor the
$2.81increase.
Although the assembly did not
vote on the resolutions, members
did elect the 2014-2015 speaker
and vice speaker of the assembly:
LSA junior Christian Bashi and

Public Policy junior Laurel Ruza,
respectively.
In his opening remarks to the
assembly following this selec-
tion process, Public Policy junior
Bobby Dishell, CSG president, wel-
comed new representatives and
also plugged the accomplishments
of Big Ten on the Hill earlier this
month.
Big Ten on the Hill is a spring
conference in which student gov-
ernment delegations from each
university in the Big Ten go to
Washington, D.C. to meet with

their state's Congressional repre-
sentatives and lobby for initiatives
that are beneficial to college stu-
dents.
Rackham student Adi Sathi, the
executive director of the Associa-
tion of Big Ten Students, said in an
e-mail that the event was a success.
"It was a great honor to work
with such great student leaders
and discuss higher education poli-
cy as well as campus issues such as
mental health and sexual assault
prevention with the 14 schools in
the Big Ten," Sathi wrote.

Registration information
The U should provide more support and information during backpacking
anycolleges and universities, such as Cleveland State University,
are beginning to allow students to register for courses for the
entire year - during one enrollment period. Currently at the
University, students will register for fall and winter terms at different
times during the year. In fact, course guides are not even available for
the future semesters at the time one registers for the upcoming one.
The lack of information is stressful for students, and in some cases even
delays graduation when a required class does not end up being offered
when a students anticipated it would be. Further, there is a general lack of
advising opportunities for students to help them make sense of the spread
out and inconsistent course information. While having students register
for the entire year may not be the answer, the University should provide
course information for the entire year in order to help students plan their
academic careers.

To'help students in the current registration
process, the University needs to improve the
quality of its advising programs. Students are
first introduced to the hassle of registering
for classes during their freshman orientation,
but increased advising opportunities should
be available and suggested to help freshmen
register for second semester classes. After the
initial meeting at orientation, students often
find it difficult to meet with their advisor.
General advisers should be more available and
encouraged to develop closer relationships with
students to better aid their decision-making.
One way to provide greater access to advising
is to increase the number of advisors. This will
create more opportunities for personalized
service, and help build stronger relationships
between advisors and students. However,
because there are simply so many students, the
University should also expand peer-advising
programs. Further, advising centers should
create a program to help students choose a
major or career. This would help give students
more direction, and make the backpacking
process easier.
Additional information needs to be given to
students to help them register. The following
semester's course guide should be available to
help students, especially those taking classes
that build off of each other. Planning on a
semester-to-semester basis or guessing on
availability based on previous term offerings
is an inadequate approach to guarantee
graduation success. Other universities -

such as Michigan State and Cleveland State
- provide their students with the option for
registering for a full year of classes at one time.
While instituting a similar process here at the
University would require time, research and a
period of trial and error, the University should
provide students with information about the
availability of courses readily and easily for an
entire year. Other information like past syllabi
and student ratings of the course should also be
accessible when students register.
While the information should be made
available in advance, having students register
for the entire year is not in their best interest.
It would disadvantage students who are
undecided on a major or who may change
their major, as they might decide during their
fall semester courses that a particular field is
not for them. If they are already registered for
more of these classes for the winter semester,
by the time that they change their schedule,
many classes they may wish to take will be
full. Methods of registration should not punish
those who are still exploring different majors
and career paths.
Considering students' restraints regarding
time and money, the University should do
everything in its power to encourage degree
completion for its students. Working to fulfill
requirements and succeed in class are already
strenuous challenges for students. Failing to
provide sufficient course information only
prevents students from reaching academic
and personal goals.

Ramping up the campus
bicycle parking policy
TO THE DAILY:
Imagine you are running late for class.
What do you do? You could walk, but by the
time you arrive at your ASIANLAN 102 class
in North Quad, your professor will have just
finished roll call. Not being there on time will
result in a .5 percent reduction from your final
grade. You start to panic, and decide that rid-
ing your bike to North Quad will enable you
to just make it on time. Upon arrival at North
Quad, you notice that available parking for
bicycles is limited. However, out of the cor-
ner of your eye, you spot the accessible ramp,
which is completely void of bikes. Without
thinking twice, you decide to ignore the
numerous "no bicycle parking" signs, lock
your bike to the handrail and hurry to class.
This might not seem like a big deal to
someone who does not constantly think
about whether or not they can enter or exit
a building. However, there are several stu-
dents at the University of Michigan who have
mobility impairments, and that thought is
always on their minds. While the student that
locks their bike to an accessible ramp might
have done so to avoid arriving slightly late to
class, a mobility-impaired student might not
even be able to attend the same class as a con-
sequence of the first student's actions. Worse
yet, in times of emergency, students with
mobility impairments may be prevented from
exiting a building safely due to a bike being
locked to a ramp.
Central Student Government's Commission
of Campus Accessibility and Disability Affairs
in conjunction with Sgt. Gary Hicks of the
University of Michigan Police Department and
Carole Dubritsky, the University's Americans
with Disabilities Act Coordinator, have devel-
oped procedures to remedy this problem.
Effective April 1, 2014, bicycles locked to
the handrail of an accessible ramp will be

subject to impoundment when a complaint is
called in to the UMPD's non-emergency line
at (734) 763-1131.
Upon receiving a complaint, the UMPD will
dispatch an officer to the ramp in question. If
the aforementioned bike is registered with the
University Police Department, the student will
receive a phone call alerting them that they
need to remove their bike immediately or it will
be impounded. If the bicycle was not registered
with University Police, it will be subject to
immediate impoundment.
When the bikes are impounded, they are
taken to a secure location. In order to get the
impounded bike back, a student has to call
the University Police property desk at (734)
763-3434 to make special arrangements to
pick it up. If the bike is not registered, the
University police officers will ask for certain
information in order to verify that the owner
is who they claim to be. While there is not a
fine associated with impoundment, students
whose bikes have been impounded will have
to register their bikes with the UMPD to have
their bike released.
Incoming freshmen will now be informed
of this policy at orientation, and encouraged
to register their bikes. Doing so will help
police officers more easily identify bikes if
they are stolen and help return them to their
owners. In order to register a bike, please
visit http://www.police.umich.edu/.
As exemplified in the hypothetical situa-
tion detailed above, students that park their
bicycles on accessible ramps are not doing so
maliciously. Rather, they just aren't putting
themselves in the shoes of the students that
necessitate the use of these accessible ramps.
With this new procedure in place, it is the
hope that the University student body will
become more conscientious of this issue, and
respectful of those who utilize these ramps
as their primary means of entering and
exiting buildings.
Ryan Bartholomew
LSA sophomore

As I struggle to finish the
papers, projects and
assignments that have been
pilingup all term
within the final
week of classes,
one thing I'm ,
continually
pushing out '
of my mind is
this: I'm a rising
senior. This HARLEEN
year is when KAUR
I'm supposed
to create the
experiences that
I'll both reminisce about down the
road and reflect upon as I encourage
(read: require) my children to apply
to the University of Michigan. But
how do I want to remember it all?
Justlikeyesterday,Istillremember
the day I received my acceptance
to the University of Michigan -
December 16, 2010, in case you were
wondering. I remember the never-
ending tears I shed on my last day
of high school, singing the national
anthem at graduation and attending
my peers' graduation parties
weekend after weekend.
I remember getting the contact
information for my freshman year
roommate, meeting up with her
at Navy Pier over the summer and
building our list of inside jokes
throughout the year. I remember
attending Honors Kickoff,
surviving Great Books with Mira
Seo, staying up late prior to orgo
exams and frantically finishing my
notecard for Calculus It exams an
hour before the test began.
I remember moving into my five-
person suite in North Quad with

four friends from my freshman
year hall, completely in awe of
the amount of space we had to
ourselves. I remember late-night
runs to the dining hall, early
mornings in the CLC and the panic
during the day of the "flood." I
remember receiving my rejection
from the Ford School with only a
month left of classes, struggling to
find a major as I finished my second
year and picking English because
it's always been my favorite.
I remember coming back from
Manhattan to ResStaff training
for my position as an Honors RA
in West Quad. I remember hot
nights on the fourth floor without
air conditioning or an elevator,
meeting my residents and taking my
first classes for my concentration
and minor. I remember reading
novels overnight, submitting
papers a minute before the
CTools submission deadline (not
recommended) and studying in the
Union until I was forced out at 2
a.m. I remember seeing President
Barack Obama, again, watching our
team in the Final Four, again, and
experiencing the thrill of the Notre
Dame night game, again.
And yet, here I am: a risingsenior.
With only one year out of four
left, each moment seems even
more precious. Seeing all of my
graduating friends get ready to
pack up and leave for the last time
invokes the worst in my nostalgic
self, leaving me unable to think
about the numbers of days, hours
and minutes we have left together.
I can't explain the butterflies Iget
every time I look at my calendar and
see April 22 approaching quickly. I

can't explain the uneasiness I had
while signing up for my fall term,
knowing that I would only have
one more time to peruse the course
guide after this one. I can't explain
the panic I feel when I think about
how, after graduation, I'll have to
figure out what to do when I can't
see my best friend every single day.
But, the one thing I can explain is
how happy I am - even with all the
ups and downs - to have been able
to spend my last three years here.
And I thinkit seems fittingto reflect
on all of it before we start another
school year for the last time.
Next year, I want to focus on
obtaining an education, not a
diploma. I want to attend events,
partake in dialogues and form
relationships that challenge my
ideals and accept me for who I am.
I want to push my passions to a
higher level, taking my involvement
to new heights and creating a new
vision for the impact I hope to leave
on this campus. I want to cheer
until I'm hoarse at a football game
one day, challenge the institutional
hierarchies and prejudices that we
sometimes uphold the next day and
still wear maize and blue for no
other reason but school spirit at the
end of it all.
I want to take time to sit in the
Diag, enjoy the sun with friends
and a new book and appreciate
our campus for the natural beauty
that it is. Next year, I want to have
no regrets.
Class of 2015, let's make this last
one count. Here's to senior year.

Traveling on the Arts road

"Where are the croissants?"v
Middli g'i ghts'

Despite Michaelson's
vocals, production
disappoints
By KEN SELANDER
Daily Arts Writer
Ingrid Michaelson's voice
is pitch-perfect - almost too
perfect at times, as odd as that
might sound.
Her latest B
album, Lights
Out, places Lights Out
her voice
center stage Ingrid Michaelson
with plenty of Cabin 24
creative lyrics;
but many of
the often vaguely country-
sounding instrumentals behind
her are painfully generic. While
this is a good quality record, it
feels like there's just something
missing that would make it
outstanding.
The strongest, most soulful
song on Lights Out is "War
Path," which features a country
feel, lightly distorted guitar
and a certain sassiness that
could inspire an audience: all
of which makes it stick out
like a sore thumb. Sadly, this is
also placed as the third to last
song on the album. As for much
of the rest of Lights Out, the
record has an apparent tension
between Michelson's passion
and a lack of soulfulness in her
voice.
It seems that she almost
restricts herself, or is
restricted, from showing how
strong her emotions might be.
A perfect example is "Open
Hands" featuring her co-writer
Trent Dabbs. The song has a
grounding piano that nicely

accompanies her wonderfully
versatile voice. While the low
pitch she often relies on helps
add a little bit of strength and
character to her vocals, it
seems like she's holding back,
just to make sure she doesn't
stray from her mechanically
squeaky-clean singing. If she
were to rip loose and allow
herself to be more raw and edgy,
a great deal of power would be
added to the track.
Much like in "Open Hands,"
piano is incorporated in a
number of tracks trying to
account for Michaelson's lack of
power and soul in her voice. She
lets loose a bit more in "Ready
to Lose," again featuring
Trent Dabbs. The song begins
with piano, and has a pleasing
harmony throughout. At the
same time, there's still an
element of fragility to her voice
that can't be shaken.
One of the few places where
her voice doesn't sound as
delicate is on a couple of
the more country-inspired
numbers, especially "Stick."
The song contrasts with the
first three songs on Lights Out
because you could imagine
her performing in front of an
audience, rather than alone in a
smallaroom in a studio. "Stick"
has an epic feel to it, with
staccato violin, upbeat piano
and tambourine that makes it
easy to want to clap along. This
is one of the rare occasions
in the album where the
instrumental actually enhances
her voice and elicits some
edginess instead of attempting
to mask its more soft nature.
Conversely, in "Everyone is
Gonna Leave Me Now," the
crescendo of the drums and
guitar clearly does a lot more

work than Ingrid's voice itself
in powering the song.
Along with occasional
country inspirations, the record
features a dash of synth here and
there. The opening track, "One
Night Town," featuring Mat
Kearney, seems to imply that
the album will feature a unique
combination of synthesizer and
have a predominantly country-
pop feel; However, the album
doesn't pursue these elements
as much as expected.
Don't get me wrong - while
this albumhas its shortcomings,
it definitely has its strong
points. "Girls Chase Boys" is a
very quirky, upbeat track that
is unique in that it is a "happy
breakup song." The contrast
of short and poignant piano
notes with alternating snare
beats makes for a giddy, almost
silly instrumental. Ingrid's
voice might lack some element
of rawness, but she certainly
doesn't lack range or talent. I
justruminate onthe lack of edge
in her voice because I think
this album could be absolutely
mind blowing if she managed to
incorporate some more grit into
her fragile, beautiful voice.
Lights Out is a little too
perfect, because it doesn't
really seem to push, but rather
contently stays in place. I love
Michaelson's voice, but not
the album. Ingrid is, of course,
the main showcase of the
album, but the accompanying
instruments are usually too
generic and ordinary to bring
the album together as a whole.
If Ingrid were to develop her
voice a little more - notthrough
vocal lessons of any kind, but by
adding some fire to her golden
pipes - she'd probably be one of
the best singers I've ever heard.

Music ... or Sports?
That was the original dilem-
ma, the first really consequential
choice I made after arriving at
the University. Sure, I had made
a tentative
choice for
major (later
changed), and
yes, I could

maybe more.
But I didn't
want that - no, this was going to
be a decision of influence, to define
my path of journalistic intent for
the next four years.
But - what did I want to write
about?
As you can probably guess, I
walked to the left of the news-
room that fateful mass meet-
ing, away from the Sports desks
and toward the rather quirky
set of writers gathering around
the Arts area. A few weeks later,
and I was writing my first album
review. (I like to remember it as
Bruce Springsteen's The Promise,
but unfortunately the honor goes
to a 2 1/2-star review of a mixtape
album by The Big Pink. Ugh.)
I can't say that I haven't thought
about how my career would've
turned out if I'd taken the alterna-
tive route. I'm a sports fan, after all
- my interests were almost equal
back as a freshman, just as they
are now. Sometimes, I wonder
where I would've been had I spent
my nights at the Crisler Center,
instead of deeply immersed in the
latest album.
But I can tell you one thing:
Music opens up a potential for
experiences that is, in my opinion,
unparalleled.

troversial of the BSU's demands
called for the University increase
Black student enrollment to 10
percent of the student body. Even
before the consideration of race
was banned under Proposal 2,
Black students did not represent
10 percent of the studentbody.
The University often cites the
challenge of convincing under-
represented minority students to
enroll and not choose more highly
ranked Ivy League schools which
may be able to offer more competi-
tive financial aid packages.
Beginning winter term, BSU
students will assist at admissions
events in an attempt to increase
the number of underrepresented
minority applicants. BSU stu-
dents will develop a process for
current students to encourage
applicants to enroll at the Uni-
versity.
The BSU also demanded
greater availability of affordable
housing closer to Central Cam-
pus. Though the BSU's original
demand did not touch on trans-
portation, the University's initial
plan to address affordable hous-
ing will focus on the availability
of transportation to areas fur-
ther from campus.
This spring, a pilot program
will launch that provides trans-
portation for students living
in neighborhoods beyond Ann
Arbor. The University created
a program through the Dean of
Students office where students
can apply for limited funding
to cover certain transportation
costs. However, the release did
not mention additional initia-
tives to improve affordable hous-
ing beyond the transportation
program.
The University also empha-
sized its commitment to creating
a new Trotter Multicultural Cen-
ter on Central Campus and noted
that a group has been created to
begin exploring the design, pro-

gramming and location for the
new center.
In addition to the regular
funding allocated to the Trotter
Center, the University provided
$300,000 announced at the end
of January to make changes that
will improve the building's safe-
ty and make it more comfortable
for students. Some changes are
already underway.
The report also cited a new
social identity and bystander
intervention program set to
launch in the fall, Change It Up,
as a mechanism for addressing
the BSU's demand for updated
Race & Ethnicity requirements.
The program will engage incom-
ing residence hall freshmen on
the topic of race.
More direct changes to the
Race & Ethnicity distribution
requirement were not articu-
lated, but the release noted BSU
students will meet with associ-
ate deans from each school and
college to further discuss poten-
tial changes to the require-
ments.
Additionally, after a survey
determined that emergency
funds for students were not
exhausted for the academic year,
BSU leaders determined a great-
er effort was needed to publicize
the availability of these funds.
As a result, a central website was
created to provide students with
contact information for emer-
gency funding and programs in
each undergraduate college.
And to address the BSU's
concerns about a perceived
lack of access to historical
documents related to the Black
Action Movements of the 1960s,
many of which are not central-
ly located in various archives
across campus, an initial group
of Bentley Historical Library
documents related to student
protests in the 1960s have been
digitized. A long-term plan for
the remaining documents is
also being created.
Finally, a proposal increasing
funding for the BSU was gener-

ated and is pending legal and
budgetary review. The review
is scheduled to be completed by
June.
"We realize that these meet-
ings with administration were
only small wins," LSA senior
Geralyn Gaines, BSU secretary,
wrote. "They were only the
beginning. There is still a lot of
work to be done on both ends.
I do hope that the demands of
the Black Wolverines continue
to be high on the priority list for
the University in order to reach
the long-term goals we created
together as students and mem-
bers of the administration."
Still, both sides expressed a
positive outlook in regard to the
progress. E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student life, was
already looking ahead to next
year.
"I'm looking forward to build-
ing on the great progress we've
made this year and staying in
dialogue with the students,"
Harper said in the release. "We
have identified a number of next
steps and will, for example, con-
tinue our work on Trotter, the
race and ethnicity class require-
ments and recruiting of under-
represented minority students."
LSA junior Tyrell Collier, the
speaker of the Black Student
Union, lauded the process as an
important step in addressing
diversity on campus. Collier was
unavailable for comment Tues-
day evening.
"I think this movement, in
all of its facets, served as a huge
reality check for both University
officials and the University of
Michigan community at large,"
Collier wrote in a release. "How-
ever, it opened the door for us
to have a constructive dialogue
on the challenging issues facing
U-M's campus and get to work
on finding ways to alleviate these
problems. Working hand-in-
hand with University officials
proved to be the best method for
tackling tough issues facing the
student body."

U.S. Navy sub in
Indian Ocean has
yet to find debris
from missing plane
PERTH, Australia (AP) - A
robotic submarine looking for
the lost Malaysian jet contin-
uedits second seabed search on
Wednesday as up to 14 planes
were to take to the skies for some
of the final sweeps of the Indian
Ocean for floating debris from
the ill-fated airliner.
The U.S. Navy's Bluefin 21
submarine began its second
20-hour underwater mission on
Tuesday after cutting short its
first because the ocean waters
where it was sent were too deep,
officials said.
The unmanned sub is pro-
grammed to hover 30 meters
(100 feet) above the seabed, but
it started searching atop a patch
that was deeper than the sub's
maximum operating depth of
4,500 meters (15,000 feet), the
search coordination center and
the U.S. Navy said.
A built-in safety feature
returned the Bluefin to the sur-
face and it was not damaged,
they said.
The data collected by the sub
was later analyzed and no sign of

the missing plane was found, the
U.S. Navy said.
Crews shifted the search zone
away from the deepest water
before sending the Bluefin back
for Tuesday's mission, the U.S.
Navy said.
The search coordination cen-
ter said 11 military planes and
three civilian planes would
search a 55,000-square-kilo-
meter (21,000-square-mile)
expanse of ocean on Wednes-
day centered 2,000 kilometers
(1,300 miles) northwest of the
Australian west coast city of
Perth. Eleven ships would also
join the search.
Isolated showers were fore-
cast in the search area with sea
swells up to 2 meters (6 feet, 7
inches) and visibility of five kilo-
meters (3 miles), the center said.
With no wreckage from the
Boeing 777 yet found, authori-
ties said this week that the days
of the surface search were num-
bered as the hunt for the remains
of Flight 370 moved under the
waves.
Search authorities had known
the primary search area for
Flight 370 was near the limit of
the Bluefin's dive capabilities.
Deeper-diving submersibles
have been evaluated, but none is
yet available to help.
A safety margin would have
been included in the Bluefin's

program to protect the device
from harm if it went a bit deeper
than its 4,500-meter limit, said
Stefan Williams, a professor of
marine robotics at the Univer-
sity of Sydney.
"Maybe some areas where
they are doing the survey are a
little bit deeper than they are
expecting," he said. "They may
not have very reliable prior data
for the area."
Meanwhile, officials were
investigating an oil slick about
5,500 meters (3.4 miles) from the
area where the last underwater
sounds were detected.
Crews collected an oil sam-
ple and sent it back to Perth for
analysis, a process that will take
several days, said Angus Hous-
ton, the head of the joint agency
coordinatingthe search off Aus-
tralia's west coast.
He said it does not appear to be
from any of the ships in the area,
but cautioned against jumping to
conclusions about its source.
The submarine is pro-
grammed to take 24 hours to
complete each mission: two
hours to dive to the bottom, 16
hours to search the seafloor, two
hours to return to the surface,
and four hours to upload the
data.
The Bluefin can create a
three-dimensional sonar map of
any debris on the ocean floor.

pact approaches

Rouhani calls
Geneva agreement a
surrender of Western
nations
LUXEMBOURG (AP) - Euro-
pean Union foreign ministers
decided Monday to sanction
more Russians with asset freez-
es and visa bans as a sign of the
trade bloc's outrage over Mos-
cow's ongoing interference in
Ukraine, a high-ranking EU offi-
cial announced.
EU foreign policy chief Cath-
erine Ashton declined to make
public the number or the names
of any of the Russian officials
or citizens affected. Another
European Union official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity
because of a lack of authorization
to reveal details, said the deci-
sion, adopted unanimously bythe
trade bloc's 28 foreign ministers,
needed to be enshrined in legal
documents, and that they will be
drafted quickly.
The decision was reached at a
meeting of the ministers domi-
nated bythe crisis in Ukraine and
how the EU should respond, Ash-
ton told a news conference.
"Foreign ministers roundly
condemned the illegal armed
activity in eastern Ukraine over
recent days. We are issuing a very
direct call on Russia to publicly
repudiate this activity," Irish For-
eign Minister Eamon Gilmore
said.
Some ministers arrived in
Luxembourg talking tough. The
coordinated action of armed
pro-Russian groups occupying

government buildings in eastern
Ukraine "is something that is being
planned and brought about by
Russia," and needs to be met with
further sanctions, British Foreign
Secretary William Hague said.
Russia has strenuously denied
involvement in the escalation
of armed violence in eastern
Ukraine, but several EU min-
isters noted events there have
echoed what happened in the
Crimean Peninsula before Russia
unilaterally annexed it.
"The problem is it looks very,
very similar to what happened
previously in the Crimea. So you
know, if it looks like a horse and
it walks like a horse, it's usually
a horse - and not a zebra," said
Frans Timmermans, foreign
minister of the Netherlands.
Like many matters in the
European Union, though, levying
sanctions requiresthe unanimous
consent of member states. What
ministers were able to agree on
Monday was a public warning
that "any further steps by the
Russian Federation to destabilize
the situation in Ukraine would
lead to additional and far-reach-
ing consequences in a broad reach
of economic areas" between EU
countries and Russia.
Preparatory work on just what
those economic measures could be
is proceeding.
On Thursday, Ashton is sched-
uled to meet in Switzerland with
Secretary of State John Kerry
and the foreign ministers of Rus-
sia and Ukraine. Some EU mem-
ber country governments will
be closely watching the Kremlin
delegation's actions to deter-
mine whether it's time to move to
what, in the trade bloc's jargon.

Drop the base: Michigan's walk-up songs

By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Wrtiter
Due to the snowstorm
Tuesday, the Michigan baseball
team's home game against
Eastern Michigan has been
pushed to Wednesday. The
game will also be the fans' only
chance this week to catch the
Wolverines' walk-up songs.
The walk-up song, a mix of a
pep talk, cheerleader and tone
setter for the players and crowd,
can vary in genre and words,
but they all ready everyone in
the stadium for the at-bat. All
of them are unique and worth
a listen, but we've broken down
the top five to enjoy.
No.5:Senior catcher Cole
Martin - "Money and the Power"
by Kid Ink
"Now Martin had a dream,
I've been dreamin' about gold.
Tell 'em I just wanna shine, and
I gotta let it show." So begins
the first verse of rapper Kid
Ink's "Money and the Power."
Michigan's Martin also has a
dream every time he steps up
to the plate, to shine and maybe
bring some power of his own.
With a bubbling and
fast-paced beat that blares
throughout the bleachers, the
2013 single powers the paying
customer to life with the lower
half of the order due up. Hitting
a team-leading .353 in Big Ten
play, the song appears to be
helping Martin get hot at the
plate after a slow start on the
road. With only a few weeks left
of his collegiate career, Martin
is looking to finish strong in his
pursuit of money and power.
No.4:Freshman infielder
RamseyRomano - "Jump
Around" by House of Pain
The classic 90's hip-hop

centerpiece, you're the Maltese,
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this
peace talk can cease."
A lethal threat for power,
average and speed, the pitbull
rarely fails to unleash the
crowd with his walk-up song or
on-field play.
No.1: Sophomore infielder
Jacob Cronenworth - "The
Stroke" by Billy Squier
After Maezes' at-bat, the
drum-clap pattern of Billy
Squier's 1981 hard-rock hit
"The Stroke" perks the ears
of all in attendance. Using the
perfect pace to slow the game
down but keep everyone alert
in anticipation and a bass level
that gets the sound system's
money's worth, Cronenworth
strolls to the plate coolly and
calmly.
As he makes his way to the
batter's box, many behind him
rise to their feet, participating
in a ritual any Michigan baseball
fan will recognize. It starts as a
dugout gimmick, but without
fail, the simple movement of
bringingoutstretched arms over
their heads for a unifying clap
quickly spreads to the fans and
workers at Ray Fisher Stadium.
No matter the situation, the
stadium is alive by the time
Cronenworth stares down the
pitcher.
Cronenworth has brought
a stroke of his own with a .318
batting average and a team-
leading.477 sluggingpercentage
in Big Ten play. Ultimately,
"The Stroke" is what a walk-up
song should be: A classic, fun
and familiar song that pounds
the speakers to get the crowd
into the game, while focusing
Cronenworth with a simple
steady rhythm.
As Billy Squier sings, the song
"could be a winner boy, you
move mighty well."

Sophomore infielderJacob Cronenworth not only has an energizing walk-up song in "The Stroke," but his dance moves are even more entertaining, we suspect.

song is a near-perfect match
for the California native. The
easy-going Romano enjoys a
good time, and no one provides
that better than House of Pain.
From the horn intro to the hook,
Romano's song brings life to the
crowd, causing many to, in fact,
jump around - if only for one
at-bat.
Unfortunately for Michigan
fans, Romano will have to, as
the song says, "pack it up, pack
it in" for the rest of the season.
In a 3-2 loss to Iowa on March
28, two broken bones in his
hand will require him to take a
medical redshirt on the season.
A house of pain indeed.
No. 3:Freshman outfielder
Jackson Lamb - "Small Town
U.S.A." by Justin Moore

Lamb hailsfromTemperance,
Mich., a town of just over 8,500
residents on the southeast
corner of the state, but Lamb is
just as happy to call it "Small
Town U.S.A." Coming to Ann
Arbor and playing for a Big Ten
team can easily get hectic, so
Lamb leans on the slow-paced
2009 Justin Moore country hit
to remind the freshman of his
simple, charming roots.
The song seems to be a better
fit on a dock by the lake, but
Lamb's choice is a refreshing
change of pace. The long
twang' of the opening chord
reverberates throughout Ray
Fisher Stadium, as the crowd
takes a deep breath to relax.
With a break from the manic
game, Lamb settles in for
another battle in the 'ole ball

game. Though the song slows
down Lamb's mind, it also may
be slowing down his bat too.
He's hitting just .178 at home to
lower his overall season average
to .213.
With 19 regular season games
left, the former Michigan Mr.
Baseball will look to return to
the small-town tools that got
him to Ann Arbor.
No.2: Sophomore infielder
Travis Maezes - "Square Dance"
by Eminem.
As a lifetime southeast-
Michigan native, Maezes'
decision to choose an Eminem
song wasn't surprising, but the
choice of "Square Dance" over
other smash hits is worth an
investigation. The 2002 song is

one of the rapper's few political
songs, but Maezes utilizes the
resounding opening instead.
The electronic piano and string
instruments fuse together to
make even the squarest of fans
dance, as Eminem pipes in:
"People! It feels so good to be
back. Ladies and gentleman,
introducing the new and
improved you know who."
As the leadoff hitter with a
.388 on-base percentage and
a team-high 15 steals, fans
welcome Maezes back to the
plate with a hearty applause{
each time the batting order
resets. But by the time you-
know-who settles into his
stance, Eminem has shifted
gears: "Never been the type to
bend or budge, wrong button to
push, no friend of Bush. I'm the

During Margo
Jonker's 31
years as head coach of the
Chippewas, she's earned
more than 1,000 wins, 11 Mid-
American Conference titles and
has appeared in the College
World Series before. Both
are members of the National
Fastpitch Coaches Association
Hall of Fame.
The long history of each
coach has helped lead to an
even longer history between the
two schools. Central Michigan
has squared off at least once
against the Wolverines every
year in Michigan's 37 softball
seasons except for one, and the
Wolverines lead the all-time
series, 48-30.
Wednesday, on the field
dedicated to Margo Jonker, No.
3 Michigan hopes to extend
its 19-game winning streak.
The Wolverines have been
untouchable in the Big Ten, and
with a perfect 12-0 conference
record, they're in a great
position for a non-conference
tune-up before a matchup with
the Big Ten's second-place team,
Minnesota.
Michigan (12-0 Big Ten, 33-6
overall) shut out the Chippewas
11-0 in a five-inning mercy-
rule victory April 22 last year,

Senior outfielder Lyndsay Doyle and the Wolverines should have an easy time earning their 20th consecutive win.

and Central Michigan might
struggle just as much this
season.
But the Chippewas (5-2
MAC, 26-12 overall), have some
depth in the lineup to make
things interesting. Junior third
baseman Trista Cox has a .362
batting average in the clean-
up spot and leads the team in
hits, runs and RBI. Shortstop
Carol Ann Sexauer, who has a
batting average of .329, follows
her. The rest of the lineup is
less intimidating with the other
batters straggling behind.
Central Michigan's offense
will undoubtedly struggle
against Michigan pitching if it
continues its recent hot stretch.
Junior left-hander Haylie
Wagner, who's been named Big
Ten Pitcher of the Week twice
in 2014, boasts an earned-run
average of 0.95 and is 19-0
this season. No matter what
pitcher the Chippewas see on
the mound, it won't make the

game any easier. The pitching
staff is ranked No. 8 in in the
NCAA with a combined ERA
of 1.54, and both junior Sara
Driesenga and freshman Megan
Betsa have broken out of small
ruts that Hutchins attributed to
confidence issues.
Even when a Michigan
pitcher allows a hit, though,
the defense is right behind her.
The Wolverines committed zero
errors against Michigan State in
three games this past weekend
and have committed zero errors
in seven of their last nine games.
"The defense came up huge
today, several times, and I
just trusted that they're going
to do what they're going to
do," Drisenga said Saturday
after freshman first baseman
Abby Ramirez and senior first
baseman Caitlin Blanchard
caught line drives and doubled
the runner off first. "That was
huge for my confidence."
But what the Chippewas

lack in offense, they make up in
pitching. Right-hander Rachel
Knapp could get the start in
the circle on Wednesday. The
freshman is 8-2 thus far, with
an ERA of 2.07. The Chippewas
can also rely on right-hander
Morgan Yuncker, who tossed a
four-hitter in a win against Kent
State on Saturday.
Central Michigan can
normally depend on its pitching
to compensate for its offense,
but Michigan batters lead the
country with a combinedbatting
average of .363. Sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero not
only leads her team with an
average of .515, but she tops the
nation as well.
Playing a NCAA chart-
topping team isn't easy for
anyone. The Chippewas will
have to play their best ball of the
season to keep their home record
clear of more than one loss and
avoid becoming just another
team Michigan has mercied.

McGary injured, Robinson was
relegated to his less-preferred
'4' spot for most of the year. He
even admitted during the NCAA
Tournament that he had second
thoughts about his decision to
come back to Ann Arbor, only
to follow by noting he gained
comfort as the season went on.
Both players received advice
from their family, coaches and
teammates, as well as former
Wolverines Trey Burke and Tim
Hardaway Jr., who are each
finishing their rookie seasons in
the NBA.
"'Don't have any regrets,
don't look back once you decide

the advice Hardaway gave him.
"I heard from Trey - he kind

The announcement leaves
McGary as the only other
candidate who may bolt for
the NBA. His departure would
leave the Wolverines' frontcourt
depleted and lacking experience
next fall. McGary remains
the last of five starters from
Michigan's 2013 championship
runner-up team.
Beilein said McGary is

that the sophomore has been

has made great progress.
Experts have Stauskas slotted

CBS Sports' Gary Parrish
tabbed Stauskas going as the
15th pick to the Atlanta Hawks
and Robinson as the 39th to the
Detroit Pistons.

Michigan coach John Beilein has now lost four of his five starters from last year's Final Four run and will have no seniors
and just fourjuniors on next year's roster if sophomore forward Mitch McGary chooses to stay in Ann Arbor.

8B 2014 The Statement

In its first year, optiMize, a student
organization focused on social innovation
and entrepreneurship, has had impressive
results. The group raised $85,000 to fund
student-run nonprofits through its Social
Innovation Challenge. But all of this
success comes from humble beginnings -
a few beers shared between co-founders
Tim Pituch and Jeff Sorensen after
Festifall in 2012.
"We were trying to figure out what we
were going to do with our lives at that
point," Sorenson said, "And after the first
beer (Tim) was like 'I don't know, this
sounds OK but I've got a lot of stuff going
on.' But after the third beer, we were like
'We're going to do this and this and this.
We're going to get this done.'"
Pituch, a first year Health Informatics
graduate student, and Sorensen, a recent
graduateoftheMasterofEntrepreneurship
program, didn't have much experience
with social innovation before they started
optiMize.
"I actually hadn't even heard of the
phrase social entrepreneurship before we
starting talking about the idea of optiMize
last fall," Pituch said.
The idea grew out of a feeling of
frustration and the belief that University
students had the potential to make real
changes in the world.
"In a lot of classes we were talking
about, you know, public health issues or
education issues, environmental energy
issues, systemic inequality," Sorensen
said. "Students would come up with really
interesting ideas to address these issues
that weren't being done. And there'd be
a lot of energy around it - you could see
the potential to act on these student ideas.
But then the class would end and nobody

would actually get out and try them."
Over the past year, optiMize has
succeeded in moving those plans into
action. The money raised for the Social
Innovation Challenge went to fund more
than SO groups around campus - like
the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative
that harvests more than 10,000 pounds
of produce from the north side of Detroit
or to allow the ReSource Fund to provide
financial planning assistance to low-
income residents of Washtenaw County.
optiMize has even made an impact
on the LSA Course Guide, working to
put together several one credit courses
focused on topics related to social
entrepreneurship.
As Pituch and Sorensen are quick to
point out, however, the success of optiMize
is dependent on its ability to help students
take the first step towards putting their
own ideas and interests into action. For the
organization's founders, their partnership
provided that initiative.
"I think the fact that we were doing it
together honestly made all the difference.
If either one of us had tried to go out and
do something alone, we would have easily
gotten discouraged," Pituch said.
Moving forward, Pituch and Sorensen
hope to continue optiMize's mission
while making sure that they continue to
appreciate their success.
"We would just get so excited about
some of these things (at first)," Pituch said.
"There was many a high five that was had."
"We're getting too cynical now,"
Sorensen said. "We used to do a lot more
high fives. We used to get one meeting
with somebody and be dancing in elevators
afterward. You kind of need some of that
naivet6 at the start."

I2Wdneda, Aril16 204 / Te-Satmen 7E

Dear readers,
Of the 43,710 students on this cam-
pus, we're featuring 12 in our issue as
The Statement's 2014 Students of the
Year. Deciding our Students of the Year
was a tough call. After all, the Universi-
ty of Michigan is a huge institution that
houses remarkable talent, empathy,
and above all, rich and powerful stories
from each of the students enrolled. Our
Wolverines don't play small games.
We're big-hearted, big-voiced. We use
our vocal chords. We stomp our feet.
We dream. We spark change. The
Statement staff is tremendously proud
to feature our Students of the Year in
this semester's final issue. From film-
makers to social movement leaders to
entrepreneurs to arts visionaries, these
students cannot be reduced to a bullet
pointed list of simple accomplishments.
Rather, they're multi-dimensional, pas-
sionate and inspire us to be better lis-
teners, informers and students of the
world - not simply of the classroom.
Congratulations to our 2014 Students
of the Year. We hope their stories moti-
vate you to ignite even greater change
and awe across this campus. Enjoy the
issue.
Sincerely,
Carlina Duan

"As an active, participating student
at the University of Michigan who has
friends here, who lives here as a social
being, seeing needs that are unmet
is where I seek action," Public Policy
junior Carly Manes said.
Even during a casual conversation,
Manes' dark blue eyes will light up as
she smiles and questions you intently on
your day. Deep-seated empathy is what
pushes Manes to fight for the rights of
marginalized voices - both outside and
within the University.
Raised in a small city in New York,
Manes felt content with the way society
was before comingto the University and
said she was "complicit in the system."
She realized after arriving to campus
how dangerous conservative thinking
could be for marginalized groups.
"I didn't realize fully until I came to
college how harmful that was to soci-
ety and how that's not the society that
I want to be a part of, the kind of com-
munity that I want to live in or be a part
of," she said.
Through her presidency of Students
for Choice, a pro-choice student orga-
nization, Manes' accomplishments
include placing condoms in the vending
machines across University residence
halls, organizing the second Abortion
Speak Out event in the country and per-
suading University Health Services to
offer national brands of barrier contra-

ception for free.
"Carly had basically remade the
group," said Sophia Kotov, current pres-
ident of Student of Choice. "She made
Students for Choice this really, really
cool thing I was really excited to be a
part of"
As a freshman living in East Quad,
Manes took on the role of a self-pro-
claimed "condom-queen." She kept
condoms in her room and distributed
them to her floor whenever someone
was in need of one. She later realized
that there had to be a better mechanism
to distribute condoms to students. As of
Aug. 2013, condoms have been sold in 14
residence hall vending machines due to
Manes'efforts.
"It was a need that was previously
unmet and if we hadn't advocated for it,
it would still be an unmet need for stu-
dents," Manes said.
Carly Manes:
Though Manes called the Abortion
Speak Out her "most proud" accom-
plishment, she received threats from
pro-life activists on its Facebook page
prior to the event. As a result, Manes
took precautions to ensure the space
would be as safe as possible by hiring
security guards and researching the
University's code of conduct at public
events.
"I think recognizing that the work
that we do as a student group is a con-

troversial topic," she said. "We talk
about sex, people don't like young peo-
ple talking about sex and that's just a
reality of our world."
Aside from her work in Students for
Choice, Manes is perhaps best known
for her CSG presidential bid as the
forUM party nominee. During her
term as a CSG assembly representative,
Manes said she saw flaws in CSG and
said she believed it only catered to a few
groups on campus. By running for pres-
ident, she hoped to address these gaps
and bring to light how student govern-
ment had the potential to better each
student's University experience.
"I had the passion, I had the back-
ground and I had the skills to make it
where all students could thrive and be a
better community for all," she said.
Though their campaign ultimately
was not successful, Manes' running
mate, LSA junior Pavitra Abraham,
believes Manes will not stop trying to
make student life as fulfilling as pos- "
sible for the student body.
"Carly's next step very much is going
to include a lot of the things that were
on our (election) platform and continue
to make this campus a more inclusive,
safe space for everyone," Abraham said.
"She cannot function if she's not
doing activism or making the world the
better place, that's just her personality,"
Kotov added.

BY DANIEL WASSERMAN

On April 2, a few days before the
Final Four, Engineering graduate
student Jordan Morgan was sup-
posedtobe ona plane to Dallas. That
was the plan, anyway.
But as consolations go, an
acknowledgement from the Presi-
dent of the United States, Barack
Obama, isn't too bad.
"I want to congratulate Jordan,"
Obama said, before mentioning
Morgan's undergraduate degree in
engineering and the master's degree
in manufacturing engineering that
Morgan will receive next month.
"That's the kind of student-athlete
we're talking about."
Obama was visiting Ann Arbor in
attempts to rally support for increas-
ing minimum wage, an issue which
hit close to home for Morgan.
"I'd like to take my manufactur-
ing education and really commit to
making a difference within urban
communities, to find awayto imple-
ment sustainable manufacturing
that would provide livable wages,
not just minimum-job wages, but
actually address the issue of the cor-
porate structure of most companies
in the United States, where you've
currently got a majority of workers
fighting for what's left - the scraps,"
Morgan said.
His talk is big - a daunting chal-
lenge, it seems, but Morgan lays itall
out smoothly. He knows a thing or
two about being doubted.
After committing to Michigan

as a high school junior in Decem-
ber 2007, Morgan had to listen to
experts and fans alike say that he
didn't belong in Ann Arbor. Even
though the Wolverines, at the time
of his pledge, hadn't made an NCAA
Tournament in nearly a decade, it
was a near-consensus that his size
and athleticism were better suit-
ed for his next-best offer, Central
Michigan.
Morgan faced the same ques-
tions - welcomed them, even, to
prove a point - until the day his
playing career ended. Time and
again, Morgan answered his doubt-
ers, to the tune of 120 starts in a
program-record 140 games played, a
62.7 percent field goal mark - also
a Michigan record. Now, a month
away from graduation, Morgan has
won more games - 118 - than all
but two Wolverines.
What he gave up in stature - he
wasundersized innearlyeverygame
he played, often by three-to-four
inches and thirty-to-forty pounds
- he compensated for by being the
smartest and hardest worker on the
floor. Never consumed in individual
statistics, his prize accolade was
being named first-team All-Big Ten
Defensive last season.
He recently signed with an agent
and plans to play professionally,
likely overseas.
He'll leave Michigan not as a
superstar, but with a legacy. Follow-
ing in the line of Zack Novak and

Stu Douglass, Trey Burke and Tim
Hardaway Jr., Morgan will be the
last player that we can point to and
say, 'He laid the foundation for what
is now an elite-level basketball pro-
gram.
"In the last five years, I've really
changed the way I want to go about
my life," Morgan said. "I'm so differ-
ent than when I got here. As a per-
son, ny focus on life is so much less
about myself than when I got here."
While the Wolverines will play
on without him, Morgan's time
rebuilding in the state isn't over.
When his professional playing
career is over - when that is, not
even he knows - he'll return to the
town that raised him to embark on
a challenge much larger than resur-
recting a fallen basketball program.
"Being from Detroit, seeing all
the hurt - it's so barren in some
areas, so many homeless people,
high school students not valuing
education - it's hard to see all that
and understand why," Morgan said.
"But then, when there's no type of
economy to support really anything
in these communities, that leads to
struggle."
"That would be the main focus of
anything I do," he said.
In thatjourney, too, he's bound to
hear from the critics again. They'll
tell him, 'You can't,' but, just like he
did so often these past five years,
he'll answer with humility, a smug
grin and powerful results.,

LSAseniorNkemEzurike istheall-time
leading scorer in the women's soccer pro-
gram and has been a leader in its rise from
a Big Ten bottom feeder to a national con-
tender. Last month, she was drafted by the
Boston Breakers, a member of the National
Women's Soccer League.
But perhaps the best way to describe
Ezurike is with how she reacted to being
named one ofThe Statement's Students of
the Year.
"I feel honored - there are alot of great
students at this school, and a lot of people
around me that helped me do it," Ezurike
said.
It may not sound much different from
how many recipients would acknowledge
the award, but this rings true consistent-
ly: Ezurike is a player of few words, and
almost none of them are about herself.
Ask her about a goal, and she will credit
the player who had the assist. Ask her
about the offense, and she will credit the
midfield. Ask her about a win, and she will
credit someone else.
When she arrived at the University in
the fall of 2010, she entered a program at
the beginning of what seemed to be at the
beginning of a long roadto recovery. Mich-
igan Head Coach Greg Ryan had come
from coaching the U.S. Women's National
Team, but his team didn't have the talent
he needed to compete on a Big Ten level.
In Ryan's first two years, before Ezurike
joined the team, the Wolverines went
10-19-10 and had scored one or no goals in

29 of 39 games.
To regain relevance, the team needed
to tie together several pieces, and Ezurike,
whose name means, "What I have is great-
er than anything else," was the knot.
Her accolades and numbers speak for
themselves:the all-time leader in goals (49)
and points (118), four-time All-Big Ten for-
ward, 2013 first-team All-American. After
she graduates in May with a degree in Eco-
nomics and International Studies, Ezurike
will begin training professionally.
It takes more than just numbers to lead a
teamback to prominence,which Michigan
achieved last season with an Elite Eight
.finish. To get that far, you have to have
competitors, of which Ezurike was one of
the fiercest.
Off the field, she is shy, quiet and mild-
mannered. But when the game starts?
"She just becomes Nkem," Ryan said in
October. "She becomes that other Nkem
that everybody loves to see on the field."
Her competitiveness showed in games
last year when she would get visibly upset
with herself for missing the net. Other
times, she would get angry with an official
for a call - as she would with anything
that got in the way of winning.
"It's really funnycto me because she's not
like that at all off the field," said Kinesiol-
ogy freshman Madisson Lewid, the team's
forward, in October. "She's such a jokester,
and she's always so calm. She's a complete-
ly different person on and off the field."
"It was really tough because (Ezurike)

is sometimes too hard on herself,"
said her mother, Christie, in October.
"When the team is not doing well,
she gets really down. When that hap-
pened, she was disappointed. She
was a little bit hard on herself, but she
bouncedback."
In the middle of a scoreless streak
in 2012, Ryan went to lunch with
Ezurike and encouraged her to ease
some of the pressure. If she kept try-
ing the goals would come, he told her.
Soon, they did - and Ezurike start-
ed rolling once again.
Last season, Ezurike broke the
school's all-time scoring record on
Oct. 20 vs. Purdue, with her mom in
town from Lower Sackville, Nova
Scotia to see it. She downplayed the
record in the weeks leading up to
that game, but she knew as soon as
she scored that she had it. She was
mobbed by her teammates, then after
the game, she went over to the oppo-
site sideline to get a hug from her
mother.
That moment left Christie beam-
ing.
"She's a great daughter," Christie
said thatday."When she comes home,
you know she's home because every-
thing will be taken care of."
For four years, home was the
Michigan soccer program. And now,
thanks in large part to Ezurike, the
program is taken care of.

I Wednesday, April 16, 2014 // The Statement

BY ALICIA ADAMCZYK

Reda Jaber is shy. The graduate stu-
dent is soft-spoken and seems nervous to
talk about himself, at least initially. In the
busy lobby of the Ross School of Business,
where he is interviewed, it is questionable
whether the recorder will even pick up his
voice.
He doesn't give long-winded answers to
the questions directed his way, an anom-
aly for many people, and especially those
who have accomplished as much as he has.
To say that Jaber's curriculum vitae is
simply impressive would be a disservice.
The Dearborn native graduated with
Highest Distinction from the College of
Literature, Science & the Arts in 2008,
where he attained a 3.98 GPA ("I stayed
away from girls in undergrad," Jaber joked
of the accomplishment), and received a
Masters of Science in Clinical Research
from the School of Public Health in 2011.
In May, he will receive a Masters of
Business Administration from the Ross
School of Business and a Doctor of Medi-
cine from the Medical School.
Reda Jaber is humble. His parents
Mustapha and Salwa, immigrants from
Lebanon, didn't attend college. But they
encouraged Jaber to work hard and pur-
sue his dreams. His older brother, Ryan,
who also attended the University and is
now a physician, is his biggest influence,
although Ryan has only one graduate
degree. When he was young, Reda wanted

to be just like him.
"I didn't grow up with much and I'm
trying to take advantage of the resources
and the situation I've been put in," Jaber
said. "I think it would be a shame for me
not to try to take on multiple projects."
Reda Jaber is a visionary. A 27-year-old
with three graduate degrees is a feat in
and of itself. But it is his extracurricular
achievements that are truly admirable.
Jaber was awarded a $50,000 grant
from the National Institutes of Health
to spearhead research about the preva-
lence of depression and stigma in the
Arab-American community in 2011. The
research, which is still ongoing, led to
expanded availability of mental health
screening tools for over 1,500youths in the
Dearborn area.
Jaber and his girlfriend, LSA senior
Sara Abraham, are currently writing a
children's book entitled "Visionary Kids"
- just one of the hundreds of items on the
couple's Google Doc to-do list - which
will focus on the life of Steve Jobs and
teach kids the values of creative thinking
and entrepreneurship.
"Growing up they teach you about
the traditional careers ... But I wanted
to unlock children's potential early on
when it comes to entrepreneurship," he
explained.
Eliciting information from Jaber takes
time. He doesn't boast. But according to

his CV, he has written countless papers
and received numerous awards and dis-
tinctions. He currently has six jobs and
serves on the boards of two different
campus organizations. He can speak and
understand Arabic and is fluent in Span-
ish.
Reda Jaber is passionate. When he
discusses MI-Happy, a HIPAA-compli-
ant smartphone app he co-founded that
"engages patients to address a gap in
adherence to mental health treatment
plans," Jaber finally seems comfortable.
In fact, while Jaber eloquently
described his research interests and aca-
demic accomplishments in the medical
and science fields, it's obvious by his smile
and energy that entrepreneurship and
creative problem solving are his true pas-
sions.
"I feel like a kid in here," Jaber said,
with a sweeping hand gesture across the
lobby. "There's so many resources, so
many things to do, so many opportunities.
I enjoy it here a lot."
"There's a lot of influences here at the
Business School with my classmates,
especially the entrepreneurially-minded
ones," he added. "I'm really influenced by
their drive in general. The best part of get-
ting an MBA is the people you meet ... it's a
great atmosphere because everyone's try-
ing to help each other."
Reda Jaber is humble. In his free time,

he enjoys playing basketball, watching
movies and attending live comedy shows.
He said he wishes he had the courage to
attempt stand-up, but he doesn't possess
the skills required for the "art form." He
looks up to comedians.
When he explains how he met his girl-
friend at the Fishbowl two years ago, Jaber
cracks a self-conscious grin.
"She was working at the Fishbowl and I
asked her what time the Fishbowl closes,
even though I'd been going to the Fish-
bowl for eight years," he said, laughing. "I
knew when it closed."
After graduation, Jaber will work at
Incwell, a venture capital firm, where he
will be in charge of funding for health-
care-related startups.
Beyond that, he hasn't ruled out the
possibility of writing a second children's
book with Abraham or finishing his medi-
cal residency in the future. That's not to
say he won't miss the University, where
he's spent the past six years learning and
growing into the person he is today.
It's the atmosphere provided at a place
like the University that Jaber said allowed
his creativity and vision to take root and
flourish.
"When you're a student it's one of the
only times where you can experiment with
anything. If you fail as a student, it's not a
big deal," he said. "It's all part of the learn-
ing experience."

Most Michigan Women of Color Collec-
tive (M-WoCC) meetings look simple from
the outside - a group of students seated
in a circle, telling stories and listening.
The meetings, usually held in the Trotter
Multicultural Center, aren't even called
meetings. Instead, members of the collec-
tive typically gather every other week for
informal tea circles - with the group's
administrators responsible for providing
the tea and moderating discussion.
The heart of M-WoCC, what makes the
student organization so significant and
essential, are those discussions.
"We didn't just want to be an (organiza-
tion) that puts on events," said LSA senior
Zeinab Khalil, the co-founder M-WoCC.
"We wanted to be a lifeline - a support
group to bring women together and pro-
vide an affirming, safe space."
Khalil formed the organization with
the help of LSA senior Ciarra Ross and
other students who thought the University
lacked a space reserved for women of color
to voice concerns and personal struggles.
At its inception, the group was simply
designed to give women an opportunity to

be heard. It has since grown to offer those
same women a place where they can delib-
erate and hear each other's opinions about
racial tensions at the University.
"I think we do respond to the recent
debates about race relations, and we come
to the space when things are coming to a
head on campus," Ross said. "This is kind
of our space to just breathe, to say 'OK, this
is a lot right now - BBUM, UMDivest and
a lot of other things that bring us together.
It gives us room to breathe.'"
Ross stated how one of the biggest goals
of M-WoCC is to be able to challenge
women of color to look at themselves and.
their surroundings critically before for-
mulating an opinion.
"We need to be challenged to be consid-
ered a 'true sister friend,' where it ceases
to be about ally-hood and is really much,
much more about sisterhood," Ross said.
"We need to be real with each other and
honest because there can be so much vul-
nerability in the space."
The guidelines M-WoCC has laid out to
define the objectives of the meetings stress
that the members seek to move beyond

a safe space in order to provide a "brave
space."
Khalil and Ross took initial steps to
organize these plans after being tapped
last year by the Order of Angell, an elite
campus leadership society. Though both
chose not to remain a part of Order, the
meeting, and later work over the summer
for Youth Dialogues on Race and Ethnicity
in Metropolitan Detroit inspired them to
create M-WoCC.
"From the first time I met her, Ciarra
inspired me in really, really profound
ways," Khalil said. "This woman is so
unapologetic. Speaking truth to power,
that defines Ciarra - regardless of who
you are, she will hold you accountable, and
that takes so much strength."
Ross has also been an active member
of NOiR since freshman year, an on-cam-
pus fashion organization that combines
runway shows with community service.
This year, she took over as the associa-
tion's president and played an integral role
in organizing their latest runway show,
called "Shameless." She described how
her experiences working with socially

conscious campus groups helped her meet
and be motivated by Khalil, something she
called "the force of Zeinab."
"So I fangirl Zeinab," Ross said. "Zeinab
has been one of those people who got me to
really think critically about a lot of things
I hadn't before. When we met, I remember
one of the first things I recall her saying is
'are you sure about this?' and just her pres-
ence and who she was made me realize 'no
... I'm not.' That's been the impetus of our
friendship - she's just pushed me to think,
through her own thoroughbred activism."
Khalil, an energetic participant in the
UMDivest, described what sets that par-
ticular movement and M-WoCC apart
from many of the other organizations she
has been a part of is a dedication to student
empowerment.
"In the past few years, I have done
organizing and have been involved in stu-
dent orgs. but I've never felt this kind of
empowerment," Khalil explained. "For
M-WoCC, it made me realize that there's
so much power in the collective. It's not a
sign of our weakness - it's evidence of our
humanity."

It's an old adage : When you get to
the top, don't forget the little people.
Student director and LSA senior Zain-
eb Abdul-Nabi has already found her
footing in film, but she certainly hasn't
forgotten the little people along the
way.
As a Screen Arts and Culture major,
Abdul-Nabi applied and won the chance
to join "Team Oscar" last fall, part of
which included presenting Oscar stat-
uettes to celebrities during the 2014
Academy Awards. While it's easy to
get caught up in the glamour of being
at a show like the Oscar's, Abdul-Nabi's
SAC background kept her grounded in
what she values most: the inner work-
ings backstage.
"I just love knowing what's going on
behind the scenes, because what you
see on TV is always very put together,"
Abdul-Nabi said. "So it was really inter-
esting just to see how everyone collabo-
rates together backstage."
Humility and thoughtfulness: words
that embody Zaineb and her philoso-
phy toward film. Born in the Bronx
as the youngest of four siblings, she
pushed outside of the family's comfort
zone by leaving New York and coming
to the University on an engineering
scholarship. She wanted to be a doctor,
so she decided to pursue biomedical

engineering. But when her Engineer-
ing classes proved to be less fulfilling
than she hoped, she took a SAC class on
a whim.
"I took SAC 236, which is an intro-
ductory film course, and I loved it,"
Abdul-Nabi said. "It was one of the first
classes in my college career that, yeah,
I had to stay up late writing papers, but
it still was worth it and I still enjoyed
staying up late to write those papers."
She made the dramatic shift from
engineering to SAC, crediting her fam-
ily's habit of watching old foreign films
together as the catalyst for her interest.
"I always loved watching (old films),
and now I'm learning how to make
them."
At the University Abdul-Nabi was
involved with both the Muslim Stu-
dents Association and Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality - an activ-
ist group at the center of the UMDivest
Movement. She worked with MSA to
develop a media system in which their
lectures and events could be viewed
online, making the issues they discuss
accessible to more than just Michigan
students.
Though she hasn't had many oppor-
tunities to make her own films yet,
Abdul-Nabi strives to focus on simple
examples of humanity rather than

over-the-top production, once again
remembering the little people, the
ones backstage or behind the scenes.
To apply for the "Team Oscar," she has
to submit a short film and essay. For
her film she went to Eastern Market
in Detroit, filming people's faces and
then focusing in on their hands, illus-
trating the depth that can be found in
people's everyday activities. The film
wasn't about the "hands" themselves,
but about the stories that were carried
in the hands.
"They didn't talk about their hands,"
Abdul-Nabi said. "But it's just about the
way we connect people to their hands
and what hands can tell us about a per-
son."
As she begins envisioning her future
after her time at the University, Abdul-
Nabi values discovering an area of pas-
sion within the film industry - though
she admits with a laugh that her first
goal is just "surviving."
"I really hope I can find something
that I'm passionate about in the film
industry and not just take the job just
because it's going to pay a bill or some-
thing," she said. "I don't want it to just
be a weird job here and there - I hope
that they kind of affirm my love of the
regular people, the everyday kind of
people."

As a child, Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Mary Naoum was singing and dancing before
she could create coherent sentences, much to
the entertainment of her older siblings who
encouraged her with piano accompaniment.
With her long-running love of performing
and the arts, Naoum came to the University
not to pursue her own path to stardom, but to
learn how her craft could be used to empower
others and affect change in communities.
Naoum will receive a B.A. in Theatre Arts
with a concentration in Performing Arts Man-
agement and a minor inCommunity Action
and Social Change (CASC) in May. Her aca-
demic career has been a fusion of arts and
social justice, but she is quick to say that most
of her learning and inspiration has come out-
side the classroom.
After volunteering with Detroit Partner-
ship her freshman year, Naoum sought out
an internship with Motor City Lyric Opera,
a nonprofit arts organization in Detroit. She
also volunteered with its Opera on Wheels
program, which brings an operatic produc-
tion to different elementary schools in the
city.
Naoum said the experience made her rec-
ognize the potential of art in education.
"Whoa, opera's great, music is great, but
what I really like is the positive impact it has
on these students and the empowering pro-
cess," she said.
Excited by this type of work, Naoum
moved on to the Prison Creative Arts Project
with English Prof. Buzz Alexander. The class

produced a play with young men in juvenile
detention. Naoum singlehandedly brought
one young man from a hangdog refuser in the
corner to a full-on participant who now and
dreams of an acting career.
"That's when I really realized I'm not just
doing this for fun, combining 'social justice'
and 'theatre,'" Noaum said. "The combination
of those two things is actually incredibly pow-
erful."
Naoum involved herself with Michigan Per-
formance Outreach Workshop (MPOW) from
its inception. MPOW is a student organization
that holds a free field trip event on campus for
Detroit public school students and has an out-
reach Shakespeare puppet troupe for younger
students, among other things.
"We do improv, a capella, dance, beat mak-
ing - all different kinds of creative expres-
sion," Naoum said. "It's challenging because
in schools you're constantly having to put
information into your head and you're not
challenged to think for yourself. It's an oppor-
tunity to say to the kids: this is all you, nothing
you're going to do is wrong, and everything
you're doing is creative and original."
Tireless and eager to do more, Naoum
worked for Matrix Theatre Company, atcom-
munity empowerment theatre in southwest
Detroit. Participating in marches and com-
munity events, Matrix brings its giant, beauti-
ful puppets ofleaders in civil rights, disability
rights and other movements to teach people
about their history and brave leaders. Their
education program focuses on a social theme,

such as environmental justice, teaching the
kids about the issue, and then facilitating the
children's creation and production of original
plays centered on it.
"It's this awesome fusion of learning about
social justice issues and then also beingsocial
justice through having the kids be in charge
of creating these plays empowering them-
selves around these issues that they just
learned about, and then performing them,"
she said.
Citing Kendrick Lamar's "Good Kid, Bad
City" as a perfect example of using artis-
tic expression to incite open-mindedness,
Naoum explained why the arts can be a pow-
erful tool for social change.
"Here's a Black artist using hip-hop music
to transform people's beliefs and understand-
ings of growing up in a low-income urban
area. Not by literally preaching: 'stop doing
drugs and stop stealing, be better.' He tells a
narrative that embodies his own coming of
age ... that can be shared with others to help
them transform their existence."
After graduation, Naoum will take a year
to live and work in Detroit, and then head
to a masters program at the School of Social
Work. Naoum shares some advice for under-
grads:
"Get involved in organizations. My advice
for everything is just to listen. Listen to the
people you're working with. What they want
and think. It's never about you - well I guess
in some regards its about both of you; it's
about getting everybody involved."
