Provost: 'U' must

University Provost Philip
Hanlon forwent the formal
podium and microphone and
addressed the approximate-
ly 50 members of the Senate
Assembly at its meeting yes-

terday from a more informal
seated position in front of the
audience in a Palmer Commons
auditorium.
"I guess it's traditional that
the provost gives a speech on
this occasion, but in fact, I just
want to have a conversation,"
Hanlon said, as he sat on a stool
facing the crowd.
Hanlon touched on four
main topics during the lead
faculty governing body's meet-
ing including some autobio-
graphical information and his

thoughts on University issues,
faculty matters and budgeting
plans. He also discussed his
interest in increasing the the
tenure probation period for fac-
ulty from eight to 10 years.
Hanlon said he wanted those
present to know more about
him before he began to go into
detail about other topics.
"If you know me, you know
that I amvery committed to our
education mission, and I under-
stand that education takes
place in many venues, not only

in class," Hanlon said.
He said he thinks it is an
important time for higher edu-
cation because it is crucial that
universities train students to
operate in the world they enter
after graduation. Speaking as
a former calculus professor,
Hanlon said there are "tre-
mendous forces" exerted on
students for advancements in
global engagement, specifically
with Asia, in the area of infor-
mation technology, among oth-

U.N. chief criticized for being
soft on human rights issues

Ban Ki-moon's
office insists human
rights have not
been ignored
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Human Rights Watch singled out
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon for especially harsh criti-
cism yesterday as it took world
leaders to task for what it called
their failure to be tougher on
rights offenders.
Ban's office rejected the criti-
cism, insisting that the U.N. chief
employs both quiet diplomacy
and public condemnation with
abusive governments after deter-
mining which method will prove
most effective in each case.
Human Rights Watch's execu-

tive director Kenneth Roth also
lambasted the European Union;
the E.U.'s first high representa-
tive for foreign affairs and secu-
rity policy, Catherine Ashton;
President Obama, British Prime
Minister David Cameron, Ger-
man Chancellor Angela Merkel,
and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy.
"The use of dialogue and
cooperation in lieu of public
pressure has emerged with a
vengeance at the U.N., from
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
to many members of the Human
Rights Council," Roth wrote in
the introduction of the group's
annual report.
Ban "has been notably reluc-
tant to put pressure on abusive
governments," Roth wrote.
"To deserve a second term he
will need to be more outspoken

and consistent," Philippe Bolo-
pion, U.N. advocacy director for
Human Rights Watch said yes-
terday, referring to Ban's likely
bid for a second four-year term
later this year. Candidates for
U.N. chief are nominated by the
powerful 15-member Security
Council and must be approved by
the 192-member General Assem-
bly of member states.
In the report, Roth cited in
particular Ban's failure to pub-
licly raise China's rights records
or its imprisoned Nobel peace
laureate, literary critic Liu Xiao-
bo, in a meeting with President
Hu Jintao late last year.
At the time, Ban defended
his handling of a meeting with
Hu during an Asia trip, and told
reporters upon his return that he
spoke about human rights every-
where - including China.

Mexico reportedly allowed U.S.
to question detained migrants

WikiLeaks cables
reveal information
about anti-terror
security efforts
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Newly
released diplomatic cables indi-
cate Mexico let U.S. agents ques-
tion undocumented migrants
held in Mexican detention cen-
ters as part of anti-terror efforts,
despite the country's traditional
sensitivity about national sover-
eignty.
The latest round of WikiLeaks
cables released over the week-
end paint a picture of a nation
extremely eager for U.S. aid in
security matters, in the face of
its own disorganized intelligence
sector and threats from drug car-
tels.
Thosethreatsincluded areport
that a crime gang plotted to bring

down President Felipe Calderon's
airplane with a grenade launcher,
though no such attack ever took
place.
A May2008 cable fromthe U.S.
Embassy in Mexico expressed
concern about Mexico beingused
as a "potential transit point for
terrorists intending to launch
attacks against the U.S."
"On a positive note," the cable
noted that Mexico's domestic
intelligence agency "has allowed
U.S. government officers to inter-
view foreign nationals detained
at Mexican immigration deten-
tion centers dispersed around the
country for potential CT (coun-
terterrorism) information."
Most people held at Mexi-
can immigration facilities are
undocumented Central American
migrants, butthe Americans were
apparently worried that terror-
ists from other continents might
be using established human
smuggling routes and networks.

A February 2010 cable said
Calderon "is also concerned that
organized criminal groups may
try to establish contacts with ter-
rorists." It said Homeland Secu-
rity Secretary Janet Napolitano
responded that "although we
have not seen evidence to this
effect, the potential is there."
U.S. and Mexican officials have
refused to comment on the specif-
ics of leaked communications. In
December, Mexico's federal secu-
rity spokesman Alejandro Poire
said "the contents of the cables,
in many cases, reflect personal
points of view, are inexact, or
taken out of context."
Other cables display a grim
assessment of Mexico's ability
to fight drug cartels, saying the
country has limited intelligence-
gathering capacity and quoting
Calderon as saying politicians
could be tempted to return to
a tacit policy of tolerating the
gangs.

At least 35 dead,
180 wounded after
terrorist attack
MOSCOW (AP) - Terror-
ists struck again in the heart of
Russia, with a suicide bomber
blowing himself up yesterday
in Moscow's busiest airport
and turning its international
arrivals terminal into a smoky,
blood-spattered hall of dis-
membered bodies, screaming
survivors and abandoned suit-
cases. At least 35 people were
killed, including two British
travelers.
No one claimed responsibil-
ity for the blast at Domodedovo
Airport that also wounded 180
people, although Islamic mili-
tants in the southern Russian
region of Chechnya have been
blamed for previous attacks in
Moscow, including a double sui-
cide bombing on the capital's
subway system in March 2010
that resulted in 40 deaths.
President Dmitry Medvedev
called it a terrorist attack and
immediately tightened security
at Moscow's two other com-
mercial airports and other key
transportation facilities.
It was the second time in
seven years that Domodedo-

vo was involved in a terrorist
attack: In 2004, two female
suicide bombers penetrated
the lax security there, illegally
bought tickets from airport per-
sonnel and boarded planes that
exploded in flight and killed 90
people.
Medvedev canceled plans
to travel Tuesday to the World
Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerlandwhere he aimed to
promote Russia as a profitable
investment haven to world busi-
ness leaders.
Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin ordered the health minis-
ter to send her deputies to hos-
pitals to make sure the injured
were getting the medical care
they needed.
Russians still look to the
tough-talking Putin as the lead-
er they trust to guarantee their
security, and yesterday's attack
was likely to strengthen the
position of the security forces
that form part of his base.
Large-scale battles in Chech-
nya ended years ago, following
two devastating wars that Rus-
sia waged with the republic's
separatists, but Islamic mili-
tants have continued to carry
out suicide bombings and other
attacks.
Most have been in Chechnya
and other predominantly Mus-

lim provinces in the southern
Caucasus region, but some have
targeted Moscow, including its
subways, trains and even a the-
ater.
In Washington, President
Barack Obama condemned the
"outrageous act of terrorism"
and offered any assistance.
Those comments were
echoed by British Prime Minis-
ter David Cameron, who spoke
with Medvedev and assured
him of his complete support.
Monday's attack was most
likely carried out by a sui-
cide bomber and "attempts
were being made to identify
him," Investigative Committee
spokesman Vladimir Markin
said, adding that the attacker
appeared to have been wearing
the explosives on a belt.
The blast came at 4:32 p.m.,
when hundreds of passengers
and workers were in a loosely
guarded part of the terminal.
They were sprayed with shrap-
nel of screws and ball bearings,
intended to cause as many casu-
alties as possible.
The terminal filled with thick
smoke as witnesses described a
scene of horror.
"There was lots of blood, sev-
ered legs flying around," said
Yelena Zatserkovnaya, a Luf-
thansa official.

Retailers call for
an end to price tags
Michigan retailers are ramp-
ing up their campaign to get rid
of the state's unique law requir-
ing price tags on most items.
The Michigan Retailers Asso-
ciation commissioned a study
released yesterday that says the
state's item pricing law is a hid-
den tax on consumers. The study
says it results in higher prices for
shoppers and is no longer needed
for consumer protection.
Michigan Retailers Associa-
tion President James Hallan says
he does not think overall retail
employment would drop if the
law is repealed.
The United Food and Com-
mercial Workers union disagrees
and says jobs would be lost, par-
ticularly in grocery stores.
FAIRPORT HARBOR, Ohio
15 Ohio fires cause
mass evacuations
Built-up pressure in natural
gas lines led to a house explosion,
a series of fires and a brief evacu-
ation order on a frigid morning
yesterday for an Ohio village
of about 3,000 people, none of
whom appeared to be injured.
At least 15 fires were reported
in homes, apartments and other
buildings in Fairport Harbor, a
lakefront village on Lake Erie
about 30 miles northeast of
Cleveland. All had been extin-
guished by mid-afternoon, said
Tom Talcott, deputy chief of the
fire department in nearby Men-
tor.
The fires rendered several
structures uninhabitable, Talcott
said. Officials were still checking
homes in late afternoon to make
sure no gas built up in unoccupied
ones during the day.
DUBLIN, Ireland
Irish government
agrees to rush new
tax-raising bill.
Ireland's government and
opposition chiefs reached an
agreement yesterday that will
allow lawmakers to rush a criti-
cal tax-raising bill through
parliament so that Ireland's gov-
ernment can be dissolved next
week for a national election in
late February.
The breakthrough followed a
week of political calamities for
Prime Minister Brian Cowen,
who botched a Cabinet reshuffle,
resigned as leader of the Fianna
Fail party, and finally lost his
parliamentary majority when his
coalition partners defected to the
opposition.
Last week's humiliation forced
Cowen to call an early election
for March 11. But Finance Min-
ister Brian Lenihan, who led
Monday's negotiations, said the
agreement means parliament
will be dissolved by Tuesday,
Feb. 1, and the election date will

be moved to late February.

State Assemblywoman Pam

without saddling them with a
permanent criminal record.
"We need to create a path that

Clinton shows support HANLON
From Page 1

for Mexico in drug war

U.S. to enforce new
gun regulations
near border
GUANAJUATO, Mexico (AP)
- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton urged Mexico
to stay the course in an admit-
tedly "messy" war against drug
cartels, sayingyesterdaythatthe
Obama administration will help
with new controls on the flow of
American guns across the bor-
der.
Clinton gave strong support
for Mexican President Felipe
Calderon's battle against the
country's entrenched drug traf-
ficking organizations. And she
offered continued U.S. assis-
tance from policing to improv-
ing Mexico's judicial system.
More than 34,600 people
have died in drug-related kill-
ings in Mexico in the four years
since Calderon launched the
offensive against the cartels.
The death toll spiked 60 percent
last year.
, Mayors, police command-
ers, judges and journalists have
been gunned down. Civilians
are increasingly beingkilled and
numerous areas remain lawless.
The war has only mixed support.
Clinton said there was no
alternative to confronting the
cartels head-on.
"It is messy. It causes lots
of terrible things to be on the
news," Clinton said after meet-

ing Mexican Foreign Minister
Patricia Espinosa in the post-
card-perfect central Mexican
city of Guanajuato.
"The drug traffickers are not
goingto give up without aterrible
fight. And they do things that are
just barbaric - like beheading
people," added Clinton, who was
tomeetlaterMonday with Calde-
ron in Mexico City. "It is meant to
intimidate.Itis meanttohavethe
public say, 'Just leave them alone
and they won't bother me.' But a
president cannot do that."
With its cobblestone streets
and colonial churches, the set-
ting for Clinton's meeting with
Espinoza contrasted sharply
with the drug war raging in
other parts of the country, par-
ticularly along the U.S.-Mexican
border and western coast.
The U.S. has provided hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in
support and will deliver another
half-billion in equipment and
training this year. It has helped
train thousands of policemen
and sent helicopters and other
crime-fighting technology.
Clinton has been frank about
the shared American respon-
sibility for the drug problem.
Stubbornly high U.S. demand
drives the trade, and firearms
smuggled from the United States
are involved in much of the vio-
lence, an issue reinforced by a
small group of protesters who
greeted Clinton's arrival with
chants and signs saying "No

ers.
Hanlon also discussed the
University's current budget con-
cerns, saying that while techno-
logical advancements need to be
made to produce skilled students,
the University's "funding model
is unsustainable."
He said that solving budget
issues is currently a challenge for
all universities.
"This is not a University of
Michigan problem so much as it
is a higher education problem,"
Hanlon said.
Technology drives much of the
University's costs, Hanlon said,
so it is necessary that the Uni-
versity examines its technology
expenditures.
In addition to more prudently
determining what drives costs at
the University and reallocating
funds, Hanlon said it is essen-
tial to figure out how to remain
competitive with other univer-
sities. Such competition and
certain distinguishing factors
will help the University garner
alumni donations and invest-

ments in University endeavors,
he explained.
The University's breadth of
intellectual wealth and academic
enterprises, Hanlon said, as well
as its position as the second-larg-
est research university are some
characteristics that separate the
University from its fellow insti-
tutions.
"We are uniquely positioned to
take on some of the world's com-
plex, multifaceted problems," he
said.
A meeting attendee expressed
concerns about whether distin-
guishing the University from
other schoolsis as beneficial as
exploring commonalities. Han-
Ion said that both likenesses and
differences should be considered.
Hanlon listed Harvard Uni-
versity, Princeton University, the
University of California-Berkeley
and others as the University's
main competitors for research
funding and faculty.
The University can appear
unattractive to some professors
and instructors because there is
a larger student-to-faculty ratio
than similar institutions, Han-
lon said. But the University offers
better learning opportunities

and professional training which
attracts faculty, he said.
The, University needs more
faculty members because the
current body is spread too thin,
Hanlon said.
"By any measure we are a
highly successful university," he
said. "We just need more faculty
on the ground."
Some Senate Assembly mem-
bers asked Hanlon how he plans
to keep the University acces-
sible to students of all income
ranges and how he will quell ris-
ing tuition rates. Hanlon said he
thinks the University has done
well to keep costs for students
manageable by increasing the
University's central budget for
financial aid over the last five
years.
"We've been able to actually
weather this storm quite success-
fully," Hanlon said.
Despite careful financial plan-
ning over the past few years,
Hanlon said he does expect a
substantial reduction in state
funding appropriations for the
upcoming fiscal year.
"We are preparing for that,"
Hanlon said. "We are making
contingency plans."

change it to Bebarang, Kim said,
because "it sounds like boomer-
ang and babies. Baby clothes
that go and come back to us."
Kim said the award doesn't
mean he's successful yet, but it
inspires him to keep working.
After winning the entrepre-
neur competition, Kim said he
has received requests for busi-
ness partnerships with web
hosting companies anid baby
boutiques. He said he is still
considering all his options.
Bebaroo products are cur-
rently not being sold in order to
focus on improving and mak-
ing changes to the business,
Kim said. The website is set to
launch its services in the United
States within the next three
months.
The company plans to even-
tually serve a wider clientele

and has already received many
opportunities to franchise in
other countries, Kim said. The
need for a cheaper, less waste-
ful way to get baby clothes "is a
global problem," he said.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman honored Kim's
innovative idea at a Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs meeting on Jan. 10.
Kim said he is "absolutely
flattered" by Coleman's recog-
nizing his business.
"I would not have won this
competition without the sup-
port of the University," he said.
While the University's entre-
preneurial community already
offers students guidance and
resources to help them get their
ideas into motion, Kim said it's
important to expand the foster-
ing of entrepreneurial ideas at
the University. He said he hopes
"to make the University one of
the best-in-class in entrepre-
neurship."

TENURE
From Page 1
During the meeting, however,
Gina Poe, vice chair of the Sen-
ate Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs, said the poll was
misleading, as a majority of the
faculty in the Medical School
are clinical faculty - not ten-
ured or tenure-track faculty.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman,
a professor of statistics, said
though the regents ultimately
vote on whether a faculty mem-
ber should get tenure, only ten-
ured faculty members should be
able to make recommendations
to the regents.
"Only tenured-track faculty
should be eligible to make final
decisions (regarding tenure),"
Rothman said. "And the reason
for this is because, in the Medi-
cal School in particular, we ten-
ured and tenure-track faculty
are a minority."
Poe, an associate professor of
anesthesiology and molecular
and integrative physiology in
the Medical School, added that
they only had two non-clinical
faculty members serve on a 2005
committee that approved of
elongating the tenure period at
the University.
At the meeting, Poe read aloud
several e-mails she received
from her colleagues who disap-
proved of any changes to the
tenure probationary period -
including one from Pharmacol-

ogy Prof. Lori Isom, who served
on the 2005 committee.
"I still think it's a bad idea,"
Isom wrote in her e-mail to
Poe. "Chairs have the option of
extending the tenure process for
individuals already. In the end,
I think that this tenure policy
will only serve to up the ante, so
to speak, for everyone regarding
what is required for tenure and
basically turn assistant profes-
sors into indentured servants.
Working harder for less money
and less security."
According to Rothman, James
Wooliscroft, dean of the Medi-
cal School, recently told SACUA
that all faculty, including clini-
cal faculty, would be involved in
making tenure decisions.
In an interview after the
meeting, Rothman said that
lengthening the tenure pro-
bationary period would affect
faculty on the clinical track and
tenure track differently.
"If you're a clinician and you
don't get tenure, you stay on
and you continue as a clinician,"
Rothman said: "You have a job,'
so they don't mind that flexibili-
ty (in the tenure process). On the
other hand, research scientists,
people who are just doing basic
research...in the Medical School
don't have that opportunity."
According to Rothman, fac-
ulty in the medical school who
don't have a Ph. D. and M.D.
"can't just go on and continue
their lives" if they are denied
tenure after 10 years.

Hanlon said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily last
week that he was waiting to
see whether the Senate Assem-
bly passed the two resolutions
before he made a recommenda-
tion to the Board of Regents on
how to proceed with the pro-
posal.
It's unclear how Hanlon will
proceed now that the Senate
Assembly reaffirmed the 2006
resolution and advocated for
only tenure or tenure-track fac-
ulty to be responsible for making
tenure decisions. Hanlon said
last week that he would make
his recommendation by the end
of the week.
"If my decision is to propose
a change, it could be happening
as early as (this) week," Hanlon
said.
Rothman said a nearly unani-
mous vote was necessary to send
a message that the faculty was
opposed to the change. But if
Hanlon proceeds with his rec-
ommendation, Rothman said he
won't appeal to the regents.
"'Tm-not at all happy about
opening 5.09 at all," Rothman
said. "The issue of tenure goes
back to 1944 here on campus ...
We'll have lots of opportuni-
ties to have other chairs of this
body in the future, but I don't
want to preside over a body that
fools around with our only docu-
ment that guarantees at least an
appeal process for tenure or ten-
ure-track faculty. Opening the
door is a serious matter."


PACEMAKERS
From Page 1
ago with his colleague Timir
Baman, a clinical lecturer in
internal medicine at the Uni-
versity's Medical School, after
Baman had a patient who
requested to have her pace-
maker donated to a deserving
individual after her death.
The idea of pacemaker
reutilization is not new, Eagle
said, but efforts made by other
institutions to create such pro-
grams either failed or fell short
of expectations.
While some doctors perform
recycled pacemaker implanta-
tions on individual cases, Eagle
said his project seeks to "bring
the whole thing into the light."
Without an established
donation program in place,
Eagle said he and Baman first
had to generate public sup-
port for their project. Since the
project began, Eagle said he's
seen an overwhelming level of
interest in the program with
more than 2,000 pacemakers
donated in the last eight weeks
alone.
The majority of donated
pacemakers come from funer-
al homes across the state and
from the Michigan Funer-
al Directors Association in
Okemos, Mich. Eagle said.
LSA junior Lindsey Gaken-
heimer, a collaborator on the
project, said the response from
funeral directors across the
country has been "amazing"
so far.
Gakenheimer said her team
has overseen a steady number
of pacemaker donations, with
as many as 1,000 donated in a
single month. Once the team
collects the devices, Gaken-

heimer said, they're carefully
examined in a lab at the Car-
diovascular Center.
A special machine then
scans each pacemaker to
uncover information about its
battery life, origin and other
details. "Good" pacemakers
are set aside to sterilize for
the upcoming clinical trial the
team plans to conduct, Gaken-
heimer said.
Eagle said he hopes to over-
see the implantation of 250
devices in patients in Nica-
ragua, Guam, the Philippines
and Vietnam during the team's
planned clinical trial this sum-
mer. The donation process will
be facilitated by World Medi-
cal Relief, Inc., a Detroit-based
organization that distributes
medical resources to regions
in need, which often include
developing nations.
"We're confident the patients
that are going to get (pacemak-
ers) need them medically and
financially," Eagle said.
Once the clinical trial is
completed and the team pub-
lishes its findings, Gaken-
heimer said other countries
will have the opportunity to
develop their own programs
modeled after the University's.
Top-rated research hospitals,
like the Cleveland Clinic in
Ohio and Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital, have expressed
interest in facilitating the pro-
gram at their own institutions,
she said.
For Eagle, the need for proj-
ect My Heart Your Heart is
simple.
"It doesn't take a lot of
imagination to realize this is
something we have a moral
obligation to do," he said. "We
have a huge opportunity to
make a difference."

Grad programs should reach out to undergrads
Many University graduate schools feel that four years in
Ann Arbor just isn't enough to get the full experience.
Several of these schools - including the School of Public
Health and the Law School - have started to use on-campus pro-
grams to reach out to current Wolverines and assist them through
the application process. While it's great that some University gradu-
ate programs are working to increase the number of undergraduate
applicants from the University, many others aren't. Graduate pro-
grams at the University should heavily recruit University undergrad-
uates, and students should seriously consider staying in Ann Arbor to
receive their advanced degrees.

F or a long time, childhood
and obesity weren't a natu-
ral pair. It wasn't until later
- the teen years, specifically - that
issues of weight
loss became per-
vasive. But today,
that timeline -
has changed."
According to
the Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention, MARY
obesity rates DEMERY
increased from
5 to 18.1 percent
from 2007 to 2008 among ages 12 to
19.
These statistics are alarming, and
it only gets worse. A recent study
in Britain found that girls are more
likely to be overweight by age 7 than
boys. According to the University of
London study, about one in four girls
are overweight by age 7, as compared
to only one in six boys.
Obesity has now invaded child-
hood. This isn't a problem unique
to Britain. Childhood obesity is an
issue across the United States. And
the problemis evenbigger for adults.
According to recent CDC statistics,
about 65 percent of adults are at
least overweight, if not obese.
Though it's clear that obesity is a
major problem in this country, it's
not yet time to panic. Obesity can
be tackled and prevented through
healthy eating. Because it can be
tricky to navigate through the world
of nutrition, registered dietitians
become essential. Dietitians are
food and nutrition professionals
with educational training. Many
accredited graduate and under-
graduate programs exist across the
nation, and the University's School
of Public Health has a graduate pro-
gram in Human Nutrition for stu-
dents looking to become dietitians.
As agents of preventative medi-
cine, registered dietitians are at the
forefront of the fight against obesity.
And yet the University doesn't have
a nutrition undergraduate major.

There is no easy way for students
hopingto become dietitians to major
in a speciality that will assist them
in achieving that goal as they gradu-
ate. These forlorn students are left
with some unappealing options: cre-
ate their own major, - also known as
the Individual Concentration Pro-
gram - study a loosely related major
or wait until graduate school and
attend the School of Public Health.
Any way you look at it, there's no
opportunity for Uniyersity students
to become a dietitian directly after
getting an undergraduate degree.
Although the University would
need the American Dietetic Asso-
ciation's accreditation before form-
ing a nutrition major, it's possible to
attain and has been done elsewhere
in the state.
It's not unusual for universities
to have undergraduate dietetic pro-
grams. Michigan State University,
for instance, has an undergraduate
program in dietetics that has been
approved by the ADA. After com-
pleting an internship and an exami-
nation, students in the program at
MSU are then qualified to be prac-
ticing registered dietitians.
But it's not so easy atthe Universi-
ty. As a sophomore, I was interested
in becoming a registered dietitian.
After realizing that there was no
way to do so as an undergraduate,
I decided to fulfill all the prereq-
uisites that graduate schools with
dietetics programs required. My
first step was to make my own major
under the Individual Concentration
Program. After meeting with an ICP
adviser, I learned that other stu-
dents had made their own nutrition
majors. Unfortunately, it's ICP pol-
icy to not share the details of other
students' devised majors. But there
was another issue blocking my way
- the graduate schools. Each one's
requirements varied slightly, mak-
ing it nearly impossible to devise a
logical schedule. The University's
School of Public Health wants stu-
dents to take calculus, for instance,
while Columbia University requires

statistics. Navigating the various
prerequisites was becoming a career
in itself.
My next step was to transfer into
the School of Kinesiology. While it
wasn't an exact fit, some of the pre-
requisites - biology and physics, for
example - for movement science
overlapped. But after a few months,
I found that I was learning very little
about nutrition. I decided to spend
my undergraduate education else-
where and transferred back to LSA.
U needs an
undergradate
nutrition major.
Ultimately, my interest in becom-
ing a dietitian waned. On some level
this is becausethe University doesn't
offer a compatible program for
undergraduates hoping to become
registered dietitians." Students at
the University who want to become
dietitians after they graduate must
first pay tuition for four years to
study an unrelated major, and then
they must pay even more for gradu-
ate school. They don't actually get to
help people until many years after
they've finished their undergradu-
ate education.
One of the reasons I turned away
from becoming a dietitian was
because I didn't want to wait until
after graduate school to start help-
ing people - surely this reasoning
applies to others too. Obesity - not
just for children - is a huge issue in
this country. It affects millions of
people daily. The University should
create an undergraduate program
geared toward those who want to
become registered dietitians. It's
time for the University to join the
fight.

The Law School, Ford School of Public Pol-
icy and School of Social Work are just some of
the graduate schools that have started target-
ing more University undergraduates. Some
of the schools hold informational lectures
throughout the year and send out e-mails and
postcards to potential applicants, while other
schools have developed programs specifically
for undergraduate students. The Law School's
program, Wolverine Scholars, allows current
undergraduate students to apply without tak-
ing the LSAT if they have a GPA of 3.8 or high-
er. The School of Public Health has a program
called 4 + 1, which allows students to graduate
in five years with their bachelor's and mas-
ter's degree. And the School of Social Work
now has a preferred admissions program. As a
result of these programs, application numbers
are climbing. According to a Jan. 20 article in
the Daily, the School of Public Health's appli-
cations from University undergraduates rose
from 1,650 in 2008 to 2,100 inx010.
It's encouraging that University gradu-
ate programs are reaching out to University
undergraduates and offering them advantag-
es. Undergraduates at the University already
have a solid understanding of the University's
environment and demands. Providing oppor-
tunities like the Wolverine Scholar's program
or preferred admissions programs allots
students deserved benefits. But more gradu-

ate schools, specifically Rackham Graduate
School, need to have programs like these. The
other professional schools - like the School of
Dentistry and Medical School - should also
reach out to students on campus. These feeder
programs help strengthenthe application pool
and maintain a high student retention level.
But graduate schools cannot expect under-
graduate students to build a model 'resume'
on their own. Graduate schools need to work
closely with students throughout their under-
graduate years to make sure they're on track
for the desired graduate program. Graduate
schools should provide class and extra-curric-
ular advising so that undergraduate students
are able to create a strong application.
But students need to also be interested in
these programs. The University has a variety
of excellent programs, and undergraduate
students need to remember these on-campus
resources when they apply to graduate school.
They should attend information sessions and
learn about the graduate programs that are
right in Ann Arbor. Students should at least
consider these options and seek out these
graduate schools throughout the application
process.
The University's graduate schools need
to work more closely with undergraduate
students and encourage them to stay in Ann
Arbor for one or seven more years.

Students need to learn more Let Chris Armstrong move
about drug policies past the Shirvell incident

TO THE DAILY:
Jake Fromm should be congratulated on his
thought-provoking comments in his viewpoint
(Talk policy, not pot, 01/20/2011). As faculty
members, it's our responsibilityto help educate
students educate themselves.
The Ann Arbor law that decriminalized
marijuana years ago was clearly a step in the
right direction for users as well as naysayers.
Controversial issues always have a pro and con
set of facts. Furthermore, the "facts" may not
always have as much truth as society needs to
know to formulate rational drug policies.
As a professor concerned with what drug
abuse does to the human body, it's important
to note some so called "facts" aren't actually
facts. This is especially true with occasional vs.
chronic use of pot. Personal education on the
pro and con use of pot, tobacco and other drugs
of abuse is far more helpful to society.
Chronic marijuana use has very serious
potential side effects. These include a greater
incidence of schizophrenia in young people,
reduction of male fertility and possible testicu-
lar cancer. These effects need to be studied fur-
ther - some of the money spent on the War on
Drugs needs to be used to support more medi-
cal research. Also, current medical marijuana
needs to be standardized for relative D9THC,
cannabidiol and tar content.
Jake: You and your fellow students here at
the University, take advantage to educate your-
selves. Personal education will do far more to
change drug policy and someday truly let our
remarkable country reach its full potential.

TO THE DAILY:
Last semester, The Michigan Daily
released a five-page story highlighting
Michigan Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong and his attempts to overcome the
hurtful and inappropriate actions of former
Michigan assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell (The next chapter: MSA president
Chris Armstrong works to re-define his presi-
dency after Andrew Shirvell, 12/06/2010).
The article mentioned how Armstrong
and his executive board plan to put the issue
behind them and start addressing the many
important concerns that this administration
proclaimed they would tackle in the Winter
2010 elections. This goal will be extremely
hard for the Michigan Student Assembly to
attain if the Daily continues to publish sto-
ries about Andrew Shirvell and recent devel-
opments on his crazy antics.
Armstrong admitted that he experienced
setbacks when the Shirvell incident was atits
climax: "I felt to a certain extent I was letting
things get to me and had trouble refocusing,"
Armstrong said. If more attention is given to
this incident, more fuel will be added to the
fire and MSA will once again be consumed by
this atrocious controversy.
So I ask of you, The Michigan Daily, please
let MSA conduct their business and stop
bringing attention to something that we all
want to put past us. Let Chris Armstrong be
the amazing leader that he can be, and allow
him to implement positive change on this
campus.

The University of Michigan Survival Flight's first
obligation has been, and always will be, to provide the
best possible care to the critically ill patients we are
called upon to transport. Much has been said about the
training methods used to ensure Survival Flight nurses
can meet this obligation.
For quite some time we've been reducing the use of
animals in our training program with greater reliance
on simulators. In fact, of the 160 hours of ongoing train-
ing Survival Flight nurses are mandated to have, less
than 1 percent requires the use of animals that are anes-
thetized for the procedures.
To adequately prepare for their jobs, new Survival
Flight nurses undergo a four-month orientation dur-
ing which time they use simulators almost exclusively.
Survival Flight held three animal training labs in 2010,
using three cats (all of which were adopted) and 12 pigs.
One might ask, "Why can't we completely eliminate
the need for practice on animals?"
Survival Flighttransports some of the sickestpatients
in the country, who frequently require interventions the
referring hospital is incapable of performing - that's
why they're being transported to the University Hospi-
tal. On the way to the University, potentially life-threat-
ening complications can occur that require immediate,
sometimes surgical, intervention.
To save a patient's life during transport, our nurses
may need to insert a chest tube to drain blood, fluid or air
from the chest cavity to allow the patient's lungs to fully
expand. They mayhave to perform an incision to admin-
ister life-saving medications or to establish an alternate
airway when inserting a breathing tube isn't possible or
the patient's airway is crushed. Nurses may even have to
perform an invasive procedure called pericardiocentesis
to remove a dangerous build-up of fluid pooling around a
patient's heart. All these procedures require the skilled
use of a surgical scalpel..
Survival Flight nurses are trained above and beyond
the level of most all other flight teams because they're
required to perform these emergency life-saving pro-
cedures, which most nurses never will. And, because
they're not trained as surgeons, they rarely have the
surgical experience before joining Survival Flight that
they'll need to perform those procedures.
There's no rubber-coated mechanical simulator on
Earth capable of replicating the experience of perform-
ing these incisions on a living being.
The first time one of our nurses is called upon to per-
form one of these procedures will be for a critically ill
patient, and any hesitation or mistake made during the

performance of the procedure may result in the patient's
death - nurses must be 100 percent prepared to act
promptly and correctly.
There's no credible research that supports the com-
plete elimination of animals for Survival Flight nurse
training. Simulators haven't evolved to the point where
they're superior to training on an animal model for cer-
tain surgical procedures.
We're working toward complete elimination of ani-
mal labs in our Survival Flight training program, but
until new models are available, our commitment to
patient care requires us to stay the course.
When animals must be used, the labs are conducted
humanely. All animals are fully anesthetized so that
they feel no pain or suffering. The training procedures
used have been reviewed and approved by the Univer-
sity Committee for the Use and Care of Animals at the
University, whose membership includes veterinarians.
Earlier this year, in response to an outside complaint,
Survival Flight's laboratory protocols were reviewed by
the United States Department of Agriculture, and no
violations were identified.
Other flight programs across the nation still use
animal models but may not state so publicly. We know
from conversations with Michael Frakes, president of
the Air & Surface Transport Nurses Association, which
is an organization routinely referenced in claims made
against the use of animals in flight nurse training, that
organizations that host their Transport Nurse Advanced
Trauma Course select the type of lab skills they find
preferable and cost effective - not the ASTNA.
Anonymous surveys of our flight nurses who have had
training using simulators and animals overwhelmingly
agree that while simulators are beneficial for learning
when to perform certain procedures, they're no substi-
tute for scalpel-to-skin contact thatonly animal labs can
provide.
More than 35,000 patients have been transported by
Survival Flight - a testament to the training and exper-
tise of our nurses. Survival Flight has won national and
international patient care competitions fourtimes in the
past four years.
Though we look forward to the day when we can
phase out animal use completely, simulations for nurses
haven't all reached that level yet. When they have, be
assured that we will be using them. Until then, we must
continue to do what is necessary to ensure the safety of
the patients that entrust their care to us.

now, with just
the leather- TIM
bound books ROHAN
as company.
It was a few
minutes before 1 p.m. - when
the building officially opens -
but he got there early to study for
his test that was a week away.
With his Michigan sweatshirt
on, he had his Orgo papers out,
deciphering the covalent bonds
and chicken scratch he had
around each model.
The class is infamously tough
- Hussein has heard the stories.
This Bio-Psych major may
have been out the night before,
but he still had to go to the
library on Sunday. He had to
catch up on work.
Hussein goes to the University
of Michigan.
Tate Forcier used to.
But the quarterback never
fully grasped that, as a Wolver-
ine and a student-athlete, you
have two obligations: on the field
and in the classroom. Now he's
gone, and the football program is
better off for it.
At the very minimum, you just

can't neglect your schoolwork. I
understand why some athletes,
when balancing a full-time job
on the field or court with a rigor-
ous academic schedule, would
choose a major with a lighter
work load or graduate with
mediocre grades - they made
that decision and had their pri-
orities in their own order.
The choice is theirs. But the
one choice they don't have, if
they want to play in the Big
House, for Michigan, is to fail.
His father, Michael, said that
Tate didn't fail his classes, but
instead was ineligible because he
had two incomplete grades. He
said that all Tate needed was a
"chance" from at least one pro-
fessor to make up the work.
Hussein wouldn't have gotten
a second chance. Had Hussein
been Denard Robinson's pri-
mary backup this season and the
starting quarterback during his
freshman season, he, too, would
be packing his bags and leaving
Ann Arbor if he pulled what Tate
pulled.
And in his Twitter press
release announcing his depar-
ture from the Michigan pro-
gram, Tate had the nerve to
claim that the University had
given up on him.
"I really wanted to stay. I was
not giving up on Michigan, but in
the end, it was made clear they
had given up on me," Forcier
wrote.
How so?
A few weeks earlier, he was on
a plane flying home early from

the Gator Bowl, away from his
teammates. He was academically
ineligible even though, as he
told the Detroit Free Press days
before his departure, "You really
have to try to flunk out here. All
you have to do is go to class, it's
not that hard."
And Forcier could've con-
tributed to this team by spelling
Robinson, who exited nearly
every game he played in for one
injury or another.
Now there's one less headache
for Brady Hoke as he takes over
the head coaching reigns.
Forcier was a selfish player
and that's how he'll exit Michi-
gan - he missed workouts last
summer, while Robinson put in
the work and surpassed Forcier
on the depth chart.
Rich Rodriguez used to recall
his talks with Forcier and how
the coachingstaff wanted him,
and every player, to grow as
players and as people, too. Tate's
maturity was a question. Who
wants maturity to be a question
mark for a team's quarterback,
the most important leader on the
field?
More than once, Forcier
seemed happier with his own
performance than that of the
team - he could barely hide
a smile during his post-game
press conference after Michigan
lost, 38-28, against Iowa. In that
game, he threw for 239 yards in
relief of Robinson, who exited
the game due to injury.
Forcier wouldn't have met
Hoke's standard of account-

MARISSP
Sophomore quarterback Tate Forcier confirmed he is no longer with the Michigan football team last weekor

ability.
"(Accountability) means that
you're going to class so you don't
let your teammates down," Hoke
said at his introductory press
conference. "That means that
you're doing the right things in
the community and on campus.
And those are all measurable.
But every time you do something
that's out of character or you
have to enforce bad decisions,

then it tells that you this guy
is being selfish, this guy is not
being accountable to who he
should be, and that's his team-
mate."
What Tate didn't understand
was this is Michigan - in the
classroom and on the field. This
was bigger than him. That's why
he wouldn't have fit in, especially
if Hoke's integrity-strong atmo-
sphere permeates the program.

In the words of Hoke, "This is
Michigan for God's sake."
As Hussein got to work in the
library on Sunday afternoon,
he understood the work he had
to put in the classroom, though
he doesn't have to worry about
throwing a football.
Tate never got either.

Wolverines' struggles starting to
affect the team, on and off the court

With recent streak,
Blue has gone from
encourged to
frustrated
By CHANTEL JENNINGS
DailySportsEditor
Following the Michigan men's
basketball team's 69-51 win
over Oakland in mid December,
freshman forward Jon Horford
said, "I've never been on a team
like this before. I've never expe-
rienced this, we're real close."
But in the Wolverines' recent
six-game losing skid, the team is
not looking as cohesive as it used
to.
At times, sophomore point
guard Darius Morris tries, with-
out success, to corral his team-
mates before a freethrow or
after a timeout.
Against No. 15 Minnesota
on Saturday, freshman Evan
Smotrycz hit the hardwood
and sat waiting for his team-
mates to come help him back
to his feet as a few of the
Wolverines grabbed redshirt
freshman Jordan Morgan,
who was also involved in the
scuffle.
But no one came, and
eventually a Golden Gopher
grabbed Smotrycz's out-
stretched hand and helped
him up.
Just more than halfway
through the season, the team
has already experienced very
high highs and very low lows.
And right now, it's dealing
with the latter.
"That's what teams do -
they work it out. They get
together," Michigan coach
John Beilein said after the
Wolverines' loss to Minne-
sota. "Team chemistry is fine.
They've just got to understand
that there's more to it than
just all being great friends.
There's got to be a spirit about
us and a will about us to get
things done both mentally and
physically."
Despite Beilein's vote of
confidence in his team's chem-
istry, there seems to be a dif-
ferent vibe among the players
themselves.
Even in the past week-and-
a-half, the vocabulary has
changed in the players' inter-

views.
Before the Wolverines took
on a winless Indiana team on
January 15, junior Zack Novak
told reporters, "I think guys
are feeling pretty good about
the direction we're going right
now ... I feel like we're really
close, but if we could just fix a
few things then we're gonna be
there. And that's just encour-
aging - we know we still have
a long way to go but we're close
to being able to beat some pretty
good teams."
Novak was encouraged.
After Michigan's loss at the
hands of Northwestern just a
few days later, junior Stu Dou-
glass said, "Everyone's been
positive, coaching staff has been
very positive.
"We keep trying to get bet-
ter every single day and it's
something I've learned the past
couple of years - just to stay
positive and don't let it affect
you individually."

OBAMA
From Page 1
said. "There are improvements
since last year, but they're not
widespread, they're concentrat-
ed.
"He can'tthink, 'Italked about
this last year, and we're moving
in the right direction.' He has to
talk about how he wants to deal
with it," Shipan added.
Michael Traugott, a Univer-
sity professor of communication
studies and research professor
at the University's Institute for
Social Research, said that while
some strides have been made
since the thick of the recession,
Obama will most likely argue
that this progress isn't enough.
Traugott said Obama will prob-
ably attempt to persuade the
House Republicans not to block

further economic revitalization
efforts.
Traugott added that he antici-
pates Obama will also discuss
educational efforts, research
funding, areas of strategic
investment, tax cuts for the mid-
dle class and the growth of labor
industries.
In addition to economic
issues, Shipan said Obama is also
likely to talk about health care,
the importance of bipartisanship
and the budget deficit.
Since the new Republican-
controlled House approved to
repeal the Affordable Care Act
last Wednesday with a 245-189
vote, Shipan speculated that
Obama will highlight the ben-
efits of the bill and simplify it to
further the public's understand-
ing of the legislation.
"I think a lot of people feel
correctly that the administration

hasn't done a great job of selling
(health care) to people," Shipan
said. ,
Though Obama may cite effec-
tive bipartisanship efforts, like
the December 2010 agreement to
extend tax cuts at all income lev-
els, Traugott said the future will
present many more obstacles for
the divided Congress, particu-
larly on issues involving funding
for research.
"Republicans are going to go
after research funding, and he's
going to try to protect that,"
Traugott said.
Traugott said he might
address other disagreements
between the parties, including
concerns about federal expendi-
tures on defense, Social Security
and Medicare.
Shipan said public opinion will
also play a role in Obama's choice
of topics, as he will be looking

to maintain recent popularity
growth in polls and to reach out
to Americans who may support
him in the 2012 election.
"I do think that what presi-
dentssayinthe State of the Union
does have an effect on people's
attitudes," Shipan said. "It's not
going to change the minds of
anyone sitting in that room, but
it may change the minds of some
constituents."
LSA junior Charles Bogren,
chair of the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans, said
it will be essential for Obama to
detail exactly what certain poli-
cy changes mean for the public.
"I think they're going to be
displeased if he doesn't go into
specifics, and the American peo-
ple deserve to know the specif-
ics," Bogren said.
Bogren added that Obama's
speeches regarding issues

like the economy have yielded
"empty promises" thus far and
that he thinks many Americans
are beginning to realize their
wishes have been unfulfilled.
"At this point, the American
people have seen past all the
empty promises and campaign-
style rhetoric that Obama has
been using and just telling peo-
ple the economy is going to get
better," Bogren said.
LSA junior Brendan Campbell,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Democrats, said it is
essential for Obama to be specific
regarding policy change initia-
tives he has passed over the past
year. Campbell anticipates that
by explaining also how Ameri-
cans have been positively affect-
ed through legislation, they will
become increasingly supportive
of his policies.
"We've seen that when the

progress that's been made over
the past two years is clearly
outlined, the public responds
very positively," Campbell said.
"So upon reflection of our prog-
ress and looking at how we can
continue to make this progress,
his message will resonate well
amongviewers."
Campbell said he antici-
pates Obama will talk about the
upcoming struggle his adminis-
tration will face with the Repub-
lican-controlled House and his
aim to have legislators reach out
across the aisle.
"So now with Republicans in
control of the House of Repre-
sentatives, change is definitely
going to be more difficult,"
Campbell said. "With that said, I
still think that President Obama
will be able to work well with his
Republican colleagues to further
progress."

The 'Social'generation

Kids loses its edge

The entire "Social Net-
work" team is celebrating
its triumph this winter as
circles of film critics and awards
shows make it rain statuettes
over the film.
It's the rare
critical suc-
cess that not
only scores
high points in
every part of
its production'
- directing, ANKUR
writing, act- SOHONI
ing, music,
cinematogra-
phy and editing - but scores the
highest points.
Receiving the utmost praise
from among the cast and crew is
writer Aaron Sorkin, well known
for his TV success with "The
West Wing." Sorkin has a Golden
Globe in his pocket and an
almost-guaranteed Best Adapted
Screenplay Oscar waiting for him
in about a month.
But the film has been seen as
more than just a critical success.
It's more than a film - it's an
artistic achievement in the social
realm. What makes "The Social
Network" important?
The 49-year-old Sorkin, along
with 48-year-old director David
Fincher, has made a film more
current and fresh than perhaps
any mainstream competitors,
and they have, at the same time,
created a discourse both for and
concerning people half their age.
"The Social Network" isn't mere-
ly a good film, but it's one that
makes social waves far beyond its
release and will continue beyond
this awards season.
"The Social Network" interacts
with the contemporary world
unlike any other film; as unique as
Facebook itself, so too is the film
that depicts its founding.
Almost every major film
release has a Facebook page these
days - even the neglected films
dumped into the January-April
film release doldrums - and each
one seeks to use online buzz to its
advantage. "The Social Network"
had the unique opportunity to
both capitalize on Facebook's
success and make ironic the site's
graphic presence in its logo and
posters while promoting the film
among online film fan circles. A

Cold War Kids
slick but slippery on
'Mine Is Yours'
By ELLIOT ALPERN
DailyArts Writer
For those expecting a con-
tinuation of the blues-inspired,
natural Cold War Kids of Rob-
bers Et Cow-
ards, prepare
for a marginal
letdown - Cold War Kids
the band has
changed. The Mine is Yours
characteristic
rough edge, Dswntswn
which had
previously drawn comparisons
to the likes of Spoon and the
White Stripes, has been blunted
and, in some songs, removed
entirely. In its place, there is a
feel of post-production studio
refinement, of a band that has
worked and reworked each song
until it has either been polished
to a careful sheen or has become
overwrought. Cold War Kids, in
a sporadically fruitful pursuit
of precision, stripped away the
subtle imperfections that made
the music engaging.
The saving grace for Mine Is
Yours - as has always been the
case with Cold War Kids - is
the voice of lead singer Nathan
Willett. Though the instrumen-
tation may be stale at times,
those soulful vocals can add
just enough variability to make
a track worth listening to. For
instance, without Willet's voice,
"Finally Begin" would sound
like something picked up from
the floor of the Kings of Leon
recording studio. Even with
unoriginal lyrics ("Finally open
my arms wide / Finally I let
you inside"), Willett manages

"Wait, wasn't there an American Apparel here?"

to unleash astonishing prowess,
creating a viable hit single.
The album starts out strong
with the title track and picks
up steam with three more solid
songs. It begins to falter only
when it reaches "Out Of The
Wilderness," a building piece
that eventually comes out flat. At
this point, Mine Is Yours slumps
and never really recovers. Later
in the album, "Sensitive Kid"
relies a little too heavily on Wil-
lett to stand on its own. Though
he skillfully dictates the dys-
function of a teen with a single
mom, the song is too downcast
to sound vexed, and awkwardly
resides somewhere in between.
Luckily, the first half of Mine
Is Yours provides the listener
with glimpses of the rocking-
yet-restrained Cold War Kids of
old. "Louder Than Ever" com-
bines crashing cymbals and
subtle guitar to produce what
is clearly the best track on the
album. Willett provides poetic
verse ("All my windows were
barred, the sun made stripes of
shade") and a chorus that can

leave listeners humming it well
after the song has ended. Imme-
diately following it is "Royal
Blue," an impassioned composi-
tion with an irresistibly upbeat
mood. Though the track has
a new sound, it works, and it
shows what Mine Is Yours could
have been.
Cold War Kids's latest effort is
a risky departure from what gave
it a small amount of success in the
past. Nathan Willett continues
to shine as a singer, and his foray
into soul only adds to the depth
of his ability. However, Mine Is
Yours is top-heavy, leaving the
album fairly disjointed. The note-
worthy tracks are strong enough
to warrant a second or third lis-
ten, and even though some songs
are skippable, the first-half hits
manage to outweigh the busts.
Cold War Kids has shown that it
has the ability to produce creative
and talented music, but instead
of completely revamping its pre-
vious style, the band must find
the middle ground between edgy
melodies and carefully manipu-
lated music.

Creativity wins in 'Planet 2'

By SHIN HIEFTJE
DailyArts Writer
The original "LittleBigPlanet"
was a platformer that let play-
ers create their own levels with
a robust
in-game *
toolset and
then share UitlgPnet 2
those levels
easily with PS3
the rest of Sony
the world.
At first
it may seem like few concepts
have changed in the sequel, but
the deeper into it a player gets,
the more wrong that impression
becomes.
The game's new level creator
is the star of the show, allow-
ing players to create a lot of new
genres and gametypes - and
what some people have created
is just short of mind-blowing.
Whereas only platformers could
be made in the original, now both
developers and the community
have created racing games, side-
scrolling shooters, RPG combat
systems and tower defense.
Some of the user-created dual
joystick shooters are more fun
than the core platforming ele-
ments the game has been known
for. Since each level has a rating
and description, those that are
more creative and interesting rise
to the top and are easy to find.
Over 3 million levels have been
made so far, so the playability of
"LittleBigPlanet 2" is virtually
limitless. But with so many lev-
els available, the loading times
online can sometimes be slow.
The level creator is remark-
ably rich - letting players com-
bine and manipulate objects,
fabrics, stickers and more - and

allows for literally limitless cus-
tomizability. The game even
allows players to create music for
their levels. Inventing full game-
types and quality levels takes an
extraordinary amount of dedica-
tion and ingenuity, so patience is
required when approaching that
aspect of the game.
Despite the new gametypes
players are making, "Little-
BigPlanet 2" is still primarily a
2-D platformer, and a good one
at that. Most platforming levels
have a clever design that can
become challenging but never
overly frustrating. New game
mechanics, like the grappling
hook, have been introduced that
open up the level design in both
the story mode and online.
The story mode is delightful.
Stephen Fry's English-accented
narration is incredibly endear-
ing, and the dialogue is cheeky
and silly. Visually, the game is
absolutely beautiful, with realis-
tically textured fabric and wood,
making the game world look like
a giant diorama come to life. The
music is eclectic, ranging from
orchestral scores to thumping

techno to female a cappella.
There is a host of combative
multiplayer game types for two
to four players, and many are a
blast because of how frantic they
are. Some of the story mode lev-
els have cooperative aspects in
them as well, which are inventive
and well implemented.
LittleBigPlanet,
big big fun.
The only major complaint that
can be lobbied against the game
is that the controls are not ideal.
The grappling hook allows more
variation in the gameplay, but it
can often be unwieldy when try-
ing to be precise. The jumping
in the platforming sections feels
a little too floaty and slippery,
which can be slightly annoying at
times. It's far from a deal breaker,
but it's one of the few things hold-
ing "LittleBigPlanet 2" back from
perfection.

Cutest staring contest ever.

FILM REVIEW
Say no to 'Strings'

Death glare of a lite-brite.
Beam
Iron & Wine's new
release diversifies
its gentle sound
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
Samuel Beam is a man with
a raw, soulful voice, sporting
hearty facial hair and surround-
ed by some
mixed opin-
ions regard-
ing his sleepy Iron &Wine
southern music.
Known by the Kiss Each
stage name Other Clean
Iron & Wine,
the South Caro- WanerBros.
lina native has
been applauded by some for the
humble power that radiates from
his acoustic guitar. Many listen-
ers fall under the bearded man's
folksy spell with his soft, simple
strumming and the personal lyr-
ics he whispers sweetly into their
ears. To others, however, the
songsmith's rustic, understated

brings
style "justboring.
With the release of his new-
est album, Kiss Each Other Clean,
the negative press surrounding
Beam's down-to-earth vibes may
be extinguished. The album amps
up Iron & Wine's traditionally
mellow tunes with sounds and
instruments rarely heard from
the musician in his past endeav-
ors. From retro saxophones to
rhythmic synthesizers, the tracks
seethe with experimentation and
energy.
From the first eruption of digi-
tally enhanced vocals in opener
"Walking Far From Home," it's
clear Kiss Each Other Clean is a
dramatic turn from previous Iron
& Wine. The track moves with
the musician's usual' smooth-
ness, but it's matched with a
twinkling keyboard, harmoniz-
ing vocals, percussion, piano and
electronic effects - all building
on one another in a surprising
crescendo. Though this flurry
of instruments is atypical of the
musical minimalist, the lyrics
are as honest and haunting as
any other Iron & Wine song. He

beard, funk

counteracts sweet images of love
with brutal ideas, like "a car crash
in the country where prayers run
like weeds along the road." The
track is different, but not overtly
so, as it slowly eases the listener
into the changes that lie ahead in
the album.
"Me and Lazarus" is where
Beam's typical style really dete-
riorates. Second on the album,
the song is thick with a'70s funk
vibe, making use of a cool, laid-
back bass line, slick vocals and a
swanky saxophone. It's a bold but
catchy shift from the softer album
opener and is almost trancelike in
its grooviness.
While "Big Burned Hand"
and "Your Fake Name Is Good
Enough for Me" bounce with a
similar funky feel, other tracks
are infused with their own
styles. "Monkeys Uptown" is
one of these standout numbers,
relying on the deep tones of the
marimba and bass for its smooth
sound. These darker notes are
lifted by the rhythmic shak-
ers and percussion in the back-
ground, blendingto create a rich,

dynamic song that diversifies the
album.
As bold and interesting as
these instrumentals are, the
changes might inspire pangs
of nostalgia in longtime Iron &
Wine fans: The songs may be
energetic and upbeat, but they
don't sound nearly as personal
as his past acoustic music. "Glad
Man Singing" and "Half Moon"
may help satisfy these folksy
souls - these tracks sound the
closest to earlier albums like Our
Endless Numbered Days - but
with pianos and female vocal-
ists in the background, it's still a
hard comparison to make.
When Samuel Beam spoke of
his experimental freedom on the
Warner Bros. label, he wasn't
bluffing. Kiss Each Other Clean is
a storm of new instruments and
genres, linking together elements
of folk and funk in a single daring
album. It's difficult to pinpoint
the direction of his future music,
but as Beam moves away from his
typical mellowness, an inevitable
question arises: Will the beard be
the next to go?

ByBEN VERDI
DailyArts Writer
With Valentine's Day fast
approaching, significant others
everywhere will soon be scram-
bling to find
ways to express
their love for
their part- NoStrings
ners. But if any Attad
couple's Valen-
tine's Day plans At Quaity16
include seeing and Rave
"No Strings
Attached," Paramount
odds are that
couple won't make it past St. Pat-
rick's Day - no man could possi-
bly enjoy this movie.
A presumptuous statement,
yes. As presumptuous as saying
that the Earth rotates around the
Sun.
"No Strings Attached" was
written by an uncreative woman
for even less-creative women.
It's got period jokes. It's got girls-
eat-when-they're-upset jokes.
It's even got an ill conceived dig
at Lil' Wayne for the one black
woman the producers thought
would accidentally wander into
a movie about Ashton Kutcher
("Killers") and Natalie Portman
("Black Swan").
Despite how scandalous this
moviethinksitis, it's essentiallya
horribly thought-out, poorly cast
and even more poorly modern-
ized "When Harry Met Sally."
Kutcher plays a promiscuous
douchebag who inherited his
money and sense of entitlement
from his father, and - totally
coincidentally - attended the
University of Michigan, where
he was a member of a fraternity.
Portman plays his love interest -
an over-protected, innocent bal-
lerina who ominously descends
into madness as it becomes clear
she might not be as innocent ...
wait,justkidding, she plays atotal
slut.
For a movie whose trailers
and general storyline promised
sex, sex and more sex, this film

surprisingly underwhelms in
that area (if any horny fresh-
man was still planning on seeing
this movie, hopefully that last
sentence turned him or her off).
Seriously though, despite the
alarming number of people on
Facebook who think this film is
called "Sex Friends," there real-
ly isn't that much sex. At least,
there isn't any more than one
would expect from a movie fea-
turing Kutcher.
Beside its lack of sex, "No
Strings Attached" honestly wants
us to believe that the relational
dilemmas produced when people
have sex without commitment
are new and previously unex-
plored. It also wants us to believe
that Kutcher is funny doing any-
thing but smoking pot in a base-
ment on "That'70s Show."
The biggest mistake made by
the creators of this filmis assum-
ing that our generation thinks of
relationships as having the same
pitfalls that films like "When
Harry Met Sally" detailed so well
for previous generations. The
concept of "No Strings Attached"
just isn't a funny or accurate way
to depict a contemporary rela-
tionship.
There's no sex
attached, either. ,
That's not to say that we
know any more about love or
sex than our parents did, it's
just that by now - one would 4
hope - humans understand
that monogamy and promiscu-
ity are two different things. And
while people our age still get
caught between wanting both
at once, we've suffered through
enough outdated jokes, enough
video footage of Woodstock
and enough chick flicks to know
that, in the end, sex and love are
not the same.
