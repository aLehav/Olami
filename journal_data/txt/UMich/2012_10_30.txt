- Report: NHL
will cancel
outdoor game

Winter Classic
scheduled for
New Year's Day at
 Michigan Stadium
By MATT SLOVIN
and HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily Sports Editor and
Daily News Editor
The National Hockey League
plans to cancel its annual Winter
Classic on Thursday, ESPN.com
reported Monday.
The Detroit Red Wings and the
Toronto Maple Leafs are sched-
uled to play outdoors at Michi-
gan Stadium on New Year's Day.
The game is expected to be avic-
tim of the ongoing labor dispute
between the NHL and its player's
union, which has resulted in the
cancellation of the NHL season
up to this point.
But as labor negotiations
between the league and the Play-
ers' Association have come to a
standstill, it doesn't appear there
will be a resolution soon.
"I'm just hoping it's not can-
celled," said Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson. "That'll be

a world-class event for the sport
of hockey."
David Ablauf, the University's
associate athletic director, said .
the Athletic Department is mov-
ing forward with its preparations
for the game.
"Any decision would be
announced by the NHL so we,
as an athletic department, are
currently still continuing our
planning," Ablauf said by phone
Monday evening. "We're still
moving in that direction, and
any final decision one way or the
other is going to have to come
from the NHL."
Crain's Detroit Business also
reported last week that the Hock-
eytown Winter Festival will be
cancelled alongside the cancel-
lation of the Winter Classic. The
festival - a weeklong celebration
of hockey in Detroit - includes
the Great Lakes Invitational, an
annual tournament held each
December.
This season, the Great Lakes
Invitational was to be held at
Comerica Park, but it will move
back to its typical venue, Joe
Louis Arena, if the NHL can-
cels the Winter Classic, Crain's
reported.

By CSANDRA BALFOUR.
For the Daily
GRAND RAPIDS - In the
final sprint to Election Day,
Ann Romney took the stage at

the Romney campaign's office
here Monday afternoon to
rally for her husband, Republi-
can presidential nominee Mitt
Romney, and showcase her
Michigan roots.
Romney was received by
raucous applause at the office,
which was filled with GOP
supporters eager to hear Rom-
ney share her husband's mes-
sage that though the clock is
ticking, there is still time "to
save the country." With recent

polls indicating that President
Barack Obama has a slight lead
in Michigan, Romney implored
the crowd to help the campaign
bridge the gap in the days lead-
ing up to Nov. 6.
Romney, a native of Bloom-
field Hills, emphasized her
ties to Michigan during her
address, at one point holding
up her hand in the quintessen-
tial symbol of the Mitten State.
Earlier in the day, she was in
Traverse City and spent Sun-

day night at Comerica Park in
Detroit watching the Detroit
Tigers play in the World Series.
"You can't believe all the
people I run into across the
country who show me their
hand. All the fingers, thank
goodness," Romney joked.
She reassured the crowd that
Mitt Romney not only embod-
ies the qualities necessary
for a strong president, which
he demonstrated during the

improve customer
experience, Ann
Arbor deli says
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily News Editor
Like corned beef nestled
between two toasted pieces of
rye bread, the newest addition
to the Zingerman's Deli hopes
to add more meat to the eatery
in the form of additional seat-
ing, a newer, larger kitchen
and a more modern facility.
After almost two years
of construction, which was

approved by the Ann Arbor
Historic District Commis-
sion in 2011, the new additions
to the eatery will be open to
Zingerman's customers and
staff this week.
In a tour of the new expan-
sion, Lori Saginaw, Zing Look
and Feel consultant and wife
of Zingerman's co-founder
Paul Saginaw, said the new
expansion - which is a little
more than 10,000 square feet
in additional space - will give
the Zingerman's eatery the
environment it has always
needed to operate efficiently.
"We've outgrown every-
thing. And that was why this
was so necessary," Saginaw
said. "It isn't just because we

didn't have enough places to
seat people, but it was because
that little, tiny kitchen was
the only kitchen. And every-
thing that the kitchen needed
had to be put outside on the
campus in remote areas, so
people who are cooking had to
go outside the building to get
more potatoes."
Saginaw said the long-
needed expansion could not
happen in past years because
the company did not own
more space to expand. The
chance to expand came after
a house next to the eatery
was severely damaged in
a 2006 fire, an incident in
which a Zingerman's sand-

Sandy wreaks havoc along the East Coast

An unprecedented
13-foot storm surge
slams New York
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -
Superstorm Sandy slammed into
the New Jersey coastline with
80 mph winds Monday night and
hurled an unprecedented 13-foot
surge of seawater at New York
City, flooding its tunnels, subway
stations and the electrical system
that powers Wall Street. At least
10 U.S. deaths were blamed on the
storm, which brought the presi-
dential campaign to a halt a.week
before Election Day.
For New York City at least,
Sandy was not the dayslong
onslaught many had feared, and
the wind and rain that sent water
sloshing into Manhattan from
three sides began dying down
within hours.
Still, the power was out for
hundreds of thousands of New
Yorkers and an estimated 5.2 mil-
lion people altogether across the
East. And the full extent of the
storm's damage across the region
was unclear, and unlikely to be
known until daybreak.
In addition, heavy rain and
further flooding remain major
threats over the next couple of
days as the storm makes its way
into Pennsylvania and up into
New York State. Near midnight,
the center of the storm was just
outside Philadelphia, and its
winds were down to 75 mph, just
barely hurricane strength. .
"It was nerve-racking for
a while, before the storm hit.
Everything was rattling," said
Don Schweikert, who owns a bed-
and-breakfast in Cape May, N.J.,
near where Sandy roared ashore.
"I don't see anything wrong, butI
won't see everything until morn-
ing."
As the storm closed in, it
converged with a cold-weather
system that turned it into a super-
storm, a monstrous hybrid con-
sisting not only of rain and high
wind but snow in West Virginia
and - other mountainous areas
inland.
It smacked the boarded-up big
cities of the Northeast corridor

- Washington, Baltimore, Phila-
delphia, New York and Boston -
with stinging rain and gusts of
more than 85 mph.
Justbefore Sandy reached land,
forecasters stripped it of hurri-
cane status, but the distinction
was purely technical, based on its
shape and internal temperature. It
still packed hurricane-force wind,
and forecasters were careful to say
it was still dangerous to the tens of
millions in its path.
Sandy made landfall at 8 p.m.
near Atlantic City, which was
already mostly under water and
saw an old, 50-foot piece of its
world-famous Boardwalk washed
away earlier in the day.
Authorities reported a record
surge 13 feet high at the Battery
at the southern tip of Manhat-
tan, from the storm and high tide
combined.
In an attempt to lessen dam-
age from saltwater to the subway
system and the electrical network
beneath the city's financial dis-
trict, New York City's main utility
cut power to about 6,500 custom-
ers in lower Manhattan. But a far
wider swath- of the city was hit
with blackouts caused by flooding
and transformer explosions.
The city's transit agency said
water surged into two major com-
muter tunnels, the Queens Mid-
town and the Brooklyn-Battery,
and it cut power to some subway
tunnels in lower Manhattan after
water flowed into the stations and
onto the tracks.
The subway system was shut
down Sunday night, and the stock
markets never opened Monday
and are likely to be closed Tues-
day as well.
The surge hit New York City
hours after a construction crane
atop a luxury high-rise collapsed
in the wind and dangled precari-
ously 74 floors above the street.
Forecasters said the wind at the
top the building may have been
close to 95mph.
As the storm drew near, air-
lines canceled more than 12,000
flights, disrupting the plans of
travelers all over the world.
Storm damage was projected
at $10 billion to $20 billion, mean-
ing it could prove to be one of the
costliest natural disasters in U.S.

Sea water floods the Ground Zero construction site Monday night in New York.

history.
Ten deaths were reported in
New Jersey, New York, West Vir-
ginia, Pennsylvania and Connect-
icut. Some of the victims were
killed by falling trees. At least one
death was blamed on the storm in
Canada.
President Barack Obama and
Republican challenger Mitt Rom-
ney canceled their campaign
appearances at the very height of
the race, with just over a week to
go before Election Day. The presi-
dent pledged the government's
help and made a direct plea from
the White House to those in the
storm's path.
"When they tell you to evacu-
ate, you need to evacuate," he
said. "Don't delay, don't pause,
don't question the instructions
that are being given, because this
is a powerful storm."
Sandy, which killed 69 people
in the Caribbean before making
its way up the Atlantic, began to
hook left at midday toward the
New Jersey coast.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Chris-

tie said people were stranded
in Atlantic City, which sits on a
barrier island. He accused the
mayor of allowing them to stay
there. With the hurricane roaring
through, Christie warned it was
no longer safe for rescuers, and
advised people who didn't evacu-
ate the coast to "hunker down"
until morning.
"I hope, I pray, that there won't
be any loss of life because of it,"
he said.
While the hurricane's 90 mph
winds registered as only a Cat-
egory D on a scale of five, it packed
"astoundingly low" barometric
pressure, giving it terrific energy
to push water inland, said Kerry
Emanuel, a professor of meteorol-
ogy at MIT.
And the New York metropoli-
tan area apparently got the worst
of it, because it was on the dan-
gerous northeastern wall of the
storm.
"We are looking at the high-
est storm surges ever recorded" in
the Northeast, said Jeff Masters,
meteorology director for Weather

Underground, a private forecasting
service. "The energy of the storm
surge is off the charts, basically."
Hours before landfall, there
was graphic evidence of the
storm's power.
Off North Carolina, a replica
of the 18th-century sailing ship
HMS Bounty that was built for
the 1962 Marlon Brando movie
"Mutiny on the Bounty" went
down in the storm, and 14 crew
members were rescued by heli-
copter from rubber lifeboats bob-
bing in 18-foot seas. Another crew
member was found hours later
but was unresponsive. The cap-
tain was missing.
At Cape May, water sloshed
over the seawall, and it punched
through dunes in other seaside
communities.
"When I think about how much
water is already in the streets,
and how much more is going to
come with high tide tonight, this
is going to be devastating," said
Bob McDevitt, president of the
main Atlantic City casino work-
e1s UlriOn '"I think this is going to

be a really bad situation tonight"
In Maryland, atleast100feetof
a fishing pier at the beach resort
of Ocean City was destroyed.
At least half a million people
along the East Coast had been
ordered to evacuate, including
375,000 from low-lying parts of
NewYork City.
Sheila Gladden left her home in
Philadelphia's flood-prone East-
wick neighborhood, which took
on 51/2 feet of water during Hur-
ricane Floyd in 1999, and headed
for a hotel.
"Pm not going through this
again," she said.
Those who stayed behind had
few ways to get out.
Not only was the New York
subway shut down, but the Hol-
land Tunnel connecting New
York to New Jersey was closed, as
was a tunnel between Brooklyn
and Manhattan. The Brooklyn
Bridge, the George Washington
Bridge, the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge and several other spans
were closed because of high
winds.

Zombie Club marches in
support of Food Gatherers

Student group
raises awareness
for charity
By DANIELLE WALLICK
For the Daily
A peculiar groan emanated
from Nickels Arcade on Monday
night as agroup of approximately
25 students coated in grey and
red face paint attempted to give
their best zombie impressions.
As part of the second annual
Walk of the Dead Event, the
Michigan Zombie Club teamed
up with the University's chapter
of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor
Fraternity to fundraise, gather
canned goods and raise aware-
ness for the Michigan Food
Gatherers Society, an Ann Arbor-
based charity that collects food
for impoverished community
members.
Engineering freshman Lind-
say Podsiadlik led the group,
instructing the students on how
to best act like a zombie. The
group, which included one child
who heard about the event on the
radio and wanted to participate,
limped down South State Street,
cut over to South University Ave-
nue and then gathered in the Diag
before performing a rendition of
Michael Jackson's "Thriller."
ROMNEY
From Pagel -
but is a man of good character.
Ann Romney told the crowd
that they should look to "quiet,
undocumented" moments in order
to size up Mitt Romney's charac-
ter, citing the time he befriended a
14-year-old boy named David with
terminal cancer.
"The last request David made of
Mitt after developing this extraor-
dinary friendship with him was:
'Mitt, would you please give the
eulogy at my funeral?"' Romney
said. "That's the kind of character
of the person who is going to be
sittingin the oval Office."
For the Romney campaign,
the western part of the state
could prove important in gaining
Republican voters. In an analysis
of the state's political climate, the
New York Times described how
the "traditional base of Repub-
lican support" is located in the
southwest region of the state near
Grand Rapids. Data from the 2008
election also reveals that MeCain
won with a margin of 10 to 30 per-
cent over Obama in 6 ofthe 7 coun-
ties surrounding Grand Rapids,
according to the article.
U.S. Rep. Justin Amash (R-
Mich.), who is seeking re-election
in Michigan's 3rd district, and for-
mer U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-
 Mich.), who is the GOP candidate
running against U.S. Sen. Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich.) for the U.S.
Senate, took the stage before Rom-
ney and emphasized the impor-
tance of the upcoming election.
Amash and Hoekstra, both Uni-
versity alums, fired up the crowd,
stressing the need to unseat
Obama.

The zombies carried post-
ers delineating the goals of Food
Gatherers during the march, and
despite the cold, many members
of the club said they enjoyed rais-
ing awareness about an impor-
tant issue.
"It was different than any-
thing I've ever done before," LSA
junior Joe Butler said.
Butler said the signs they
carried were a great way to
promote Food Gatherers, espe-
cially because they held them up
to windows as they passed buses
and cars, adding he feels clubs
should combine their efforts
more often.
"There are so many groups
at this school," Butler said. "We
can accomplish more if we group
together."
While raising awareness for
Food Gatherers, the group also
made the most of their costumes,
chasing two men under the Engi-
neering Arch that separates-the
Diagfrom South University.
LSA junior Cam Clark, Zombie
Club co-president, said he was
pleased with the group's accom-
plishments at the end of the night.
"We raised quite a bitof money,
got some canned goods and
everyone had a lot of fun," he said.
"It was a success."
LSA sophomore Annalisa
Provenzano witnessed the group
pouring out of Nickels Arcade and

onto State Street, and said she
thought it was an effective way to
garner attention for an important
cause.
"They will get people's atten-
tion," Provenzano said. "They
will definitely get their point
across for what they are trying to
do."
On their way down South
University, LSA freshman Breah
Dean and Art & Design sopho-
more Lauren Uhlian found them-
selves caught in the zombie mob.
"I almost peed myself," Uhl-
ian said. "I'm a baby though, so I
thought it was really scary. It was
very appropriate for Halloween,
though."
LSA sophomore Elena
Khutoretsky said she was look-
ing to join a fun club on campus,
and found her place in the Zom-
bie Club. She said she enjoyed
the event and thought it was nice
to feel like a part of something
important,
Khutoretsky's roommate, LSA
junior Nick Maue, said this was
his second year participating in
the event. Though he is no lon-
ger a member of the club, he has
volunteered with Food Gatherers
and wanted to extend his involve-
ment by participating inthe walk.
"It's nice to know that when -
I'm not saying if- there is a Zom-
bie apocalypse, we are goingto be
the survivors," Maue said.

For first time,
athletes required
to report accounts
to the University
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily News Editor
This fall, Denard Robinson,
Trey Burke and other Michigan
athletes using Twitter have a
new follower - the University's
Athletic Department.
The Athletic Department
issued a social media policy this
fall which outlines guidelines
for using social media as a stu-
dent athlete and the disciplin-
ary process if postings violate
state or federal law, institution-
al policies or NCAA rules.
As stated in the Social Media
Policy - which student ath-
letes signed this fall, along with
other compliance forms - the
Athletic Department must
be notified of all social media
accounts operated by student
athletes. If additional accounts
are "added or changed," ath-
letes must inform the Univer-
sity's Compliance Services
Office, according to the agree-
ment, which was obtained by
Annarbor.com.
The group works to keep the
University's athletic program
"consistent with the letter and
the spirit of NCAA, conference
and University rules and regu-
lations," according to the Com-
pliance Services Office page on
the Athletic Department's web-
site.
David Ablauf, the Universi-
ty's associate athletic director,
said the department has had
a social media policy in place
since 2006, but this year marks
the first formalized policy the
athletes have signed.
"We decided that social
media is such a huge part of
today's society that this year we
were going to look at our policy
and rewrite it," Ablauf said.
"We had our leadership team
within athletics review it and
we all agreed to the formaliza-
tion of this new policy, so we
decided to put it into play this
fall."
Ablauf explained that the
penalties for violating the
policy will be handled by the
Athletic Department, and will
vary on a case-by-case basis.
Examples of prohibited behav-
ior include using offensive lan-
guage, posting after sporting
events when emotions can be
heightened and writing any-
thing that could be interpreted
as endorsements for, products
or services.
"There's different degrees to
the penalties we'll have for dif-
ferent student athletes," Ablauf

said. "Sometimes, if you make
a mistake on social media it
may be a conference with your
coach, or your coach and a sport 
administrator. It may be a con-
ference with the athletic direc-
tor depending on the severity
of the situation ... it could be all
the way to the point of suspen-
sion from competition."
The policy requires that
players provide their Twitter
handles and Facebook account
links to the Athletic Depart-
ment and public relations
groups within the department
to monitor the accounts, Ablauf
said. He added that they do not
request password information
or "behind the scenes access" to
any social media accounts.
Ablauf said the policy seems
to have worked well so far, and
there haven't been any social
media gaffes with student ath-
letes this fall. He hopes the pol-
icy will also educate students
about the importance of build-
ing their own brand via social
media.
"We try to use it more as an
educational process. We want
to educate them about what is
good and what is poor in terms
of how you handle yourself
in social media," Ablauf said.
"Whether you believe it or not,
the companies that will look
to hire and employ you in the
future are looking at your social
media activity."
The new policy comes in
the wake of several incidents
involving athletes on Twit-
ter. Last spring, wide receiver
Roy Roundtree and linebacker
Kenny Demens violated NCAA
recruiting rules by tweeting
their support to a new Univer-
sity commit, linebacker Mike
McCray, before National Sign-
ing Day.
Ablauf said Roundtree was
not aware that he was in viola-
tion of NCAA rules, since the
new recruit was a friend of his.
He highlighted the incident as
an example of how the policy
can help educate .student ath-w
letes about the relationship
between NCAA rules and social
media.
"I think that this just puts it
more in front of people's minds
when they're student athletes,"
Ablauf said. "Our goal is to con-
tinue to educate. Obviously,
they're on the stage, there are
things that happen and things
that people do that they don't
mean to do it, and ... the young
man did not know that was an
NCAA violation. So that's why
for us it's all about educating."
Other universities also moni-
tor student athlete social media
accounts, and some colleges
even opt to outsource the task
to other organizations. The
Universities of North Caro-
lina, Nebraska and Oklahoma

universities work with Var-
sity Monitor, a business that
tracks the social media actions
of student athletes to ensure
they stay within NCAA rules,
according to an article in The
New York Times.
The University of Florida
also works with a company
called UDiligence to monitor
social media actions of their
football players, according to
the article.
Kevin Long, CEO of UDili-
gence, said the business works
with about two dozen uni-
versities, mostly in the BCS
and Division L The company
requires student athletes to
download an online applica-
tion to allow UDiligence to
access their Twitter and Face-
book posts. The company then
uses an automated system with
various key words to search
through messages posted by
athletes and scan for any inap-
propriate content, specified by
the hiring university. The sys-
tem then updates the schools
and athlete of their findings.
Long said the company's mis-
sion is to educate athletes about
creating a social media identity
that will appeal to employers
after graduation. He referred to
the incident this fall in which
Michigan State University foot-
ball players tweeted harshly
about University quarterback
Denard Robinson's perfor-
mance in the Alabama season
opener.
"Some Michigan State play-
ers tweeted thoughts about
Denard Robinson, and because
of what they tweeted, that
is going to be the first thing
that comes up and, as a future
employer, people are going to
take a look at that and think, 'Is
this the type of person we want
to be a part of our team?'" Long
said.
In its 2012-2013 Student-
Athlete Handbook, Michigan
State Athletics Department
provides social media guide-
lines. but it daesa.not monitoi
the social mediaccounts of
their athletes. It holds "ran-
dom checks" of the accounts
and assesses incidents when
brought forward.
Ablauf said the Athletic
Department does not see the
need to bring in an outside
organization to monitor stu-
dent athlete's social media
activity at the University, add-
ing that the public and media
also serve as natural monitors
of social media messages.
"We're looking and monitor-
ing these things, but we aren't
the only people looking at
them," Ablauf said. "We have
not decided to go down the path
of using the company to moni-
tor. Right now we have a pretty
decent process in place."

most of you know," Amash said.
"And I've got to tell you that he is,
by far, the worst president we've
had in my lifetime, and I had nine
months of Jimmy Carter."
Amash,whoworks onthe House
Budget Committee in Washington,
focused on the importance of bal-
ancingthe budget.
Hoekstra - who formerly
served on the House Intelligence
Committee - discussed his frus-
trations 'with Obama's foreign
policy record, specifically alluding
to the attack on the American con-
sulate in Benghazi, Libya.
"We look at Libya, and we see
four Americans who were brutally
murdered," Hoekstra said. "Not

because of some stupid movie that
Americans published, but because
radical jihadists saw an opportu-
nity - they saw a weak America
and decided to take advantage of
it."
Hoekstra also denounced Sta-
benow for "squeezing America's
pocketbooks" and asked the crowd
to work tirelessly in the next week
leading up to Election Day.
"There is an enthusiasm that is
not being measured by the polls ...
people are waking up and saying,
we're taking our country back and
we're taking it back now," Romney
said. "A wave - it's happening, and
you can feel it in every room we go
in; you can see it in the eye of every
person you meet."

While much attention is directed toward the presidential
election, Ann Arbor's local elections are also important
to students and their daily lives. City government pro-
vides basic services to Ann Arbor residents and even has the power
to help control housing prices. Yet, no one seems to be talking about
the importance of this election for the city. The mayor, a City Coun-
cil member and numerous ballot proposals will all be voted on next
Tuesday, and all are issues are worthy of examination.

COLLEGE REPUBLICANS IE'
Shedding light on the Libya attacks

a

"I want to know why we were lied
to!" said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.)
during the Congressional Commit-
tee on Oversight and Government
Reform hearing, which concerned
the events leading up to the Sept. 11
attacks in Libya, and the misinfor-
mation campaign that seemingly fol-
lowed. Almost every week following
the attack, new documents or testi-
monies have been revealed that call
into question the Obama administra-
tion's handling of the terrorist attack
on America's embassy in Bengzhai.
This is not about politics or the left
and right. This is about the security
of our nation.
There are some very serious
national security questionsthat need
to be answered. The most significant
question is: what did the President
know, and when did he know it? Due
to three e-mails that were leaked, we
know the White House was aware of
the attack and the terrorist group's
claim of responsibility within two
hours of the events. Officials within
the administration say that claims
made on Facebook and Twitter hard-
ly constitute evidence, but by the

same logic, there's no proof that an
obscure YouTube anti-Muslim video
caused the attack either. In fact, the
document dump that resulted from
the Oversight Committee points
more toward a terrorist plot than
toward a reaction to a video. There's
no mention of any video whatsoever,
so to say the evidence wasn't there is
simply not true.
Recently, there has been stun-
ning news that an unnamed admin-
istration official denied requests for
military support three times while
the embassy - and subsequently,
the CIA safe house - was under.
attack. This constitutes a serious
failure in our foreign policy. The
administration did not provide ade-
quate security for the embassy, and
failed to deal with a direct threat to
American personnel.
It's clear that President Barack
Obama's foreign policy has failed.
It's time to set a new course, which
begins with electing Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
Unlike Obama, Romney has laid
out a plan that will work in the
Middle East to bring peace to the

region. An area of stark contrast
between Obama and Romney's
plans is on the subject of Israel.
With the situation in the Middle
East growing darker every day - as
well as the nuclear threat from Iran
always looming - it's irresponsible
and dangerous to distance America
from our closest ally in the region.
From the perspective of the people
in the Middle East and the rest of
the world, the relationship between
America and Israel is strained.
Obama's refusal to meet with the
Israeli president made it look as if
the ties between the two nations
are weakening. Carrying out this
country's foreign policy requires
reforms at home, as well as abroad.
As Romney says, "... for us to be
able to promote those principles of
peace requires us to be strong. And
that begins with a strong economy
here at home." Nothing could be
closer to the truth.

Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje, a Demo-
crat, faces independent candidate Albert
Howard in the 2012 election. Howard has
criticized the incumbent for a lack of trans-
parency, fiscal irresponsibility and misguid-
ed priorities on public safety - specifically
the cuts to the Ann Arbor Police Department
and the Ann Arbor Fire Department in the
past two years. He stated this month that
the city of Ann Arbor couldn't handle "more
than one fire," according to AnnArbor.com.
Hieftje countered with the fact that fires are
trending downward and crime levels are at
record lows.
Ann Arbor, despite Michigan's struggling
economy, is thriving. While it may seem to
some that Ann Arbor is recklessly spending
money on more frivolous expenses, like pub-
lic art, it is one of the only cities in Michigan
that can still finance more than just basic
services. Hieftje has been able to orchestrate
this without raising taxes during the reces-
sion, except for a 2012 millage to take over
sidewalk maintenance. Ann Arbor has the
responsibility to provide basic services along
with certain quality-of-life components, and
to maintain this, vote for JOHN HIEFTJE
for mayor of AnArbor.
Only one race for an Ann- Arbor City
Council seat is contested. Republican Stuart
Berry and Democrat Chuck Warpehoski are
vying for the seat to represent Ward 5, which
includes West Quadrangle Residence Hall,
Betsey Barbour Residence Hall, Helen New-
berry Residence Hall and off-campus hous-
ing from East Madison Street to East Liberty
Street and a small section near West Huron
Street. In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily; Berry stressed the importance of
addressing of basic services, such as police
and fire protection and roads. He believes
this is the primary responsibility of Ann
Arbor's government, but this severely under-
estimates what the city should do for its resi-
dents. He wants to be the opposing viewpoint
on the Council, which has no Republicans
members, yet he seems to have no further
plans beside consistently voting in the oppo-
sition of other Council members.
In an interview with the Daily, Warpehos-
ki stressed the importance of core services
as well. However, he said the government
should also provide additional services, such
as improved transportation and funding for
public art. Warpehoski said he plans to address
Ann Arbor housing costs if elected to Council,
an issue of great importance to students. This
should be a priority, and if elected, he should
come up with a specific plan to reduce hous-
ing costs. While basic services should always
be a priority in local government, Warpehoski
promises to be a more dynamic Council mem-
ber who is willingto address the problems stu-

dents face. For that reason, vote for CHUCK
WAREHOSKI for Ward 5.
Proposal A would allocate $5 million
annually for Ann Arbor's public parks and
passage would renew a similar 2006 mill-
age. The proposal, recommended by the city's
Park Advisory Commission, intends to sup-
port maintenance of city parks - including
nature preservation and security measures
- with 60 to 80 percent of the funds. The rest
of the millage would be used to improve park
capital for historic preservation, equipment
purchases and recreational facilities. Public
parks form an important part of the city's
culture. As a civic space, they allow for com-
munity growth and engagement. Vote YES
on ProposalA.
Proposal B would expand Ann Arbor's
public art funding to include temporary
installations, sculptures and murals. Ann
Arbor's current Percent for Art program allo-
cates 1 percent of the funding for city-spon-
sored construction projects for permanent
art displays and requires that the art relates
to the purpose of the department the fund-
ing comes from, like the fountain in front of
the Ann Arbor District Library. Public art
denotes culturl establishment, increases
property values and illustrates a commit-
ment to businesses from street boutique
stores to restaurants and parking structures.
The millage would generate about $459,273
in revenue its first year and it will only cost
the average taxpayer about $11 annually. As
a result, this cultural measure is sustainable
as well as sensible. Vote YES on Proposal B.
The Ann Arbor District Library Proposal
will demolish and rebuild the downtown
library at Fifth Avenue and William Street to
include a larger auditorium and study rooms,
better wheelchair accessibility, longer cafe
hours and new computers. The $65 million
bond is supported by the Ann Arbor District
Library, but several local groups have mobi-
lized in opposition. The downtown library
building is only 20 years old and the $65-mil-
lion price tag seems unreasonably hefty. The
AADL states that the demolition and subse-
quent rebuilding costs 10 percent more than
it would if the building were simply reno-
vated. Though the AADL has suggested a
30-year time table for bond repayment, the
millage places undue burden on taxpayers
for an extended period of time. Additionally,
the plan has not yet been finalized to include
important logistics such as architect choice
and building blueprints. Though libraries
remain an integral part of the community
and perform a priceless function, the AADL
needs to have a more concrete plan in place
before asking voters to approve such a large
allocation of funds. Vote NO on the District
Library Proposal.

This is part three in a five-part
series by the College Democrats
and College Republicans.

COLLEGE DEMOCRATS IWI
Firm and tough forel

On Oct. 22 was the final presiden-
tial debate in Boca Raton, Flor. What
voters saw was a president who, over
the past four years, has led America
back from not only the brink of eco-
nomic collapse, but a Commander
in Chief who has guided our nation
with a steady, pragmatic and success-
ful foreign policy making all Ameri-
cans more secure.
President Barack Obama started
his term by building a new begin-
ning between the Muslim commu-
nity and the United States, based on
greater communication. He bridged
strained relations with Russia in
order to sign a new Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty. He kept his prom-
ise in ending the Iraq war, has stood
firmly with Israel and has pushed
for greater sanctions against Iran to
stop growth of their nuclear weapons
program. He helpedbuild an interna-
tional coalition to stop the massacre
in Libya and aid the Libyan people in
overthrowing their dictator, Muam-
mar Gaddafi.
But he also knows when to take
risks and stand strong for Ameri-
can values and interests. Obama
reaffirmed "it was worth moving
heaven and earth to get Osama
Bin Laden" and that in no way did

we owe Pakistan any consulta-
tion in going after the world's most
dangerous and wanted terrorist.
Obama's consistent foreign policy
has made him a reliable leader in
the eyes of our allies, who, by and
large, support Obama over his
opponent. The president has eased
global tension and has forged a new
path for American foreign policy
that doesn't equate loudness with
toughness.
Contrast this with Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Romney,
who lacks foreign policy experience,
and has managed to make only gaffes
and missteps during his trips abroad
- insulting our strongest ally's han-
dling of the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Moreover, his insinuation that cul-
ture is the reason for the economic
disparity between Israelis and Pal-
estinians showed naivety at the least.
Romney's foreign policy isn't
grounded in any firm principles,
but his frequent flip-flopping leads
him to be reckless and misguided,
coldly politicizing any foreign trag-
edy to his advantage. Quite sim-
ply, without any firm experience
or conviction, his foreign policy is
dangerous. He has only managed
to offer baseless attacks on Obama

gn policy
of an "apology tour" and "leading
from behind." These mischaracter-
izations might work in the world
of politicking and campaigning,
but in the complex realm of world
affairs, they're petty and lack sub-
stance. Romney's hawkish ideolo-
gies, in conjunction with his lack of
experience, would be disastrous for
America's relations abroad.
When you think about the next
four years and how you will cast
your vote for president, think about
where we stood then in 2008, and
where we are now. Romney believes
louder is better, no matter what he's
saying. His foreign policy convic-
tions will aim to please the con-
servative right at the expense of
America's position in the interna-
tional community. Obama has a dif-
ferent approach - one that involves
an understanding of the problem
and defined foreign policy victo-
ries. He has garnered trust in the
international community, stood for
American values and interest, all
the while make our world safer and
more secure.

A virgin's first'Rocky
Horror'Halloween

Bird blends
barn dancing and
solemnity on 'Glory'
By KATIE STEEN
DailyArts Writer.
Andrew Bird's last album,
Break It Yourself was a charming
little thing; the
"it" refers to a
metaphorical
heart. His lat- Andrew Bird
est work, Hands
of Glory, serves Hands of Glory
as a companion Mom & Pop
album, though
"companion"
may not be the most appropriate
word.
Hands of Glory is more of an
alter ego. Even its name suggests
something darker - a "hand of
glory," for those of you not famil-
iar with old European beliefs,
is the pickled hand of a hanged
man. The album still has its share
of jaunty, fast-stringed ditties, but
there's a haunting quality to it
unfound in Break It Yourself.
The recording process for
Hands of Glory involved a group
of musicians in both a barn and
a church, surrounding a single
microphone with their acoustic
instruments. These two loca-
tions are actually quite fitting
given the nature of the album. It
shifts from melancholic coldness
to the warmth and vigor of a barn
dance, then back to the hollow,
reverberating qualities of uni-
form pews and arching marble
ceilings. Opener "Three White
Horses," for instance, is clean
and cryptic, the instrumentation
smoothly weaving in and out of
focus. The song is effortlessly
chilling, an understated premo-
nition of death.
"When That Helicopter
Comes" has a similarly slick feel-
ing. It's a sorrowful song featur-
ing Bird's violin piercing through
the refrain with a delicate cry,
airy oohs hovering in the back-
ground. But the song always
bounces back to a guitar thump-
ing along, Bird's vocals confident
and unwavering.
It's after "When That Helicop-

MOM & POP

"Aww man, Mrs. Johnson gave me a C- on my book report."

ter Comes" that the scene begins
to shift, revealing a hay-filled
room with a lanky Bird and his
troupe of flanneled musicians.
"Spirograph" is a pleasant track
that seems destined for play on
a pickup-truck radio somewhere
in Montana. And Bird seems to
have fully immersed himself in
the hay around the track "Rail-
road Bill."
"Railroad Bill" is a song teem-
ing with country quaintness. It
revolves around this "Bill" char-
acter, who, according to Bird, is a
"mighty mean man." The end of
the track includes a quintessential
hillbilly yell - a throaty, discon-
certing "Waaaooooo!" - and you
have to wonder if Bird's justbeing
ironic. Alas, he's probably not.
But let's get one thing straight
- Bird is an extremely talented
musician, regardless of whether
you're into folk songs, country
tunes, ominous death-related ele-
gies or whatever he's going for on
Hands of Glory. "Something Bibli-
cal" features a long, warm violin
solo - thick and rich as maple
syrup sliding down the bark.
"Orpheo" is a remarkably serene
track that features the soft har-
monics of Bird's violin - careful
and flawless. The song references
"Orpheo Looks Back" from Bird's
last album, but while that track is
snappy, chirpy and whistle-filled,
"Orpheo" is an auditory barbitu-
rate.
While Bird does a wonder-
ful job in assuming the rugged-
folksinger-in-a-barn persona on
Hands of Glory, the album heart-

breakingly lacks his signature
whistling. This disappointment
is made up for, however, with the
last track "Beyond the Valley of
the Three White Horses," by far
the most impressive component
of Hands of Glory.
"Horses" nine minutes
stretches to encompass the span
of a day. The song starts with
early-morning chirping, a few
anxious crickets and pizzicato
- playful and lighthearted and
all over the place - while lower
strings offer a warm blanket over
the plucking.
Ghostly vocals harmonize the
line "three white horses" repeti-
tively, and the strings begin to take
on a heavy quality that transitions
the song into darkness. "Beyond
the Valley" becomes beautifully
eerie, drifting off into a void of
warbling low notes as the "three
white horses" refrain begins to
wander back in. The song is pre-
cise and powerful, evoking some
of Bird's older work, like Armchair
Apocrypha. But most importantly,
it's a welcome relief from the
"Railroad Bill" antics Bird pulls
earlier in the album.
Bird's biggest fault with Hands
ofGlory is the depth with which it
descends into the corny realm of
country, but even then he remains
lovably dorky. He still manages to
meditate upon a number of par-
ticularly gloomy topics, and his
talent courses strong through-
out the*album. Hands of Glory is
peculiar in this sense. You might
cry, but you also might do a barn
dance.

base. "Happy
Endings" is another one of those
twenty-somethings-living-in-
a-big-city (this time, Chicago
instead of the usual New York
City) shows, but its charm lies
in the chemistry among the six-
piece ensemble cast.
In the season two finale, mar-
ried couple Jane (Eliza Coupe)
and Brad (Damon Wayans Jr.)
received a bit of bad news: Brad
was laid off from his job, calling
his full-speed-ahead mentality
into question and causing him to
rethink his workaholic nature.
In "Cazsh Dummy Spillionaires,"
Brad has already found a new job
- but Jane has no idea, and she
loves that her husband has more
time to explore hobbies like cook-
ing elaborate meals for her, taking
bubble baths and practicing his
hilarious ventriloquist dummy
act "SinBrad."
 This gives way to great gags -
Brad taking a fully clothed bub-
ble bath and Skyping Jane from
his new office with a cardboard
backdrop of their living room
behind him. But though this plot
works because of Jane and Brad's
 uber-competitive and obsessive
personalities, it would have been
nice to see Brad spend more time
caught in limbo.

Mitchell shares
fiction at UMMA

Acclaimed author
shows humorous
side at Zell reading
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Senior Arts Editor
It took three people to adapt
and direct the new sci-fi film
"Cloud Atlas," but the novel on
which the genre-bending epic is
based all sprouted from a singu-
lar mind: British novelist David
Mitchell.
"Cloud Atlas," which was
shortlisted for the Booker Prize
in 2004, intertwines six different
stories. Most of those who gath-
ered at the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art for a reading,
with Mitchell - the latest writer
in the Zell Visiting Writers Series
- had the bestsellertucked under
their arms as they waited in line
to have them signed before the
reading.
"I like that he plays around
with a lot of different genres,"
said LSA senior Sean Flores,
clutching his own copy of "Cloud
Atlas." "He's able to have six dif-
ferent types of stories in there
that are all really different in
terms of not just the content, but
also the way it's written."
Even those new to Mitchell's
work took an interest in his visit.
LSA sophomore Angeline
Dimambro hasn't read any of
Mitchell's novels, but when her
professor, Laura Thomas, told
her about the event, she went out
and bought a copyof "Black Swan
Green," a semi-autobiographical
book Mitchell published in 2006.
LSA seniors Kathryn Bea-
ton and Megan Vance were also
encouraged by their professors
to attend the event. Beaton noted
that Mitchell is coming to her
English class, "Twentieth Cen-
tury American - Literature," on
Tuesday in addition to giving a
lecture Thursday evening.
Perhapsatothe dismay of.those
who turned. out for the event,

Mitchell did notread from "Cloud
Atlas." Nor did he read from his
most recent book, the historical
novel "The Thousand Autumns
of Jacob de Zoet."
"I'm actually sick of reading
from my last book; I'm sick of
reading from all of my books,"
Mitchell said to the crowd, opt-
ing to instead read three recent
standalone pieces.
The first short story Mitch-
ell read was written for Kai and
Sunny, the artists who did the
illustrations for the UK covers
of "Cloud Atlas," and his earlier
novel, "number9dream." The
designer duo asked Mitchell
to write the story, called "The
Gardener," for their 2011 floral-
themed exhibition "The Flower
Show."
Mitchell wrote the second
story for a special collection
of short stories commissioned
by Fighting Words, a literacy
and creative writing campaign
launched by Mitchell's friend,
Irish writer Roddy Doyle. Mitch-
ell advocates for Doyle's literacy
cause in Dublin.
Only 150 copies of the collec-
tion - which also features stories
from Colm Tdibin, Anne Enright
and John Banville - were printed
for the fundraising effort.
Mitchell ended with "The
Massive Rat," a tale of a mar-
ried couple whose relationship
problems are heightened by the
presence of what they believe is a
very large rat stuck behind their
fireplace.
Before beginning the story,
Mitchell realized that all of the
pieces he had selected to read
were somewhat sad and noted
that he'd have to tell some jokes
afterward, but the mood in the
UMMA Apse was hardly somber.
The layered humor of Mitchell's
work isn't lost when he speaks in
front of a crowd.
In response to his placement
as one of Time's 100 Most Influ-
ential People in 2007, Mitchell
said-his wife doesn't think he's
even the most influential person

in their house. He's fifth - after
her, the two kids and the washing
machine.
LSA junior MaryKossarek was
impressed by how charismatic
and laid back Mitchell was.
"I just think he's a really elo-
quent author, but also really
relatable," Kossarek said. "A lot of
times, authors come off as really
aloof, and he's really personable
and friendly."
After the reading, Mitchell
hurriedly opened the floor for
questions, promising to keep his
answers to "Twitter length." In
many more than 140 characters,
Mitchell explained he doesn't
think about movie potential
when writing a novel, and he
advises that others do the same.
"Just write the book," he said.
"The biggest question you should
ever be asking is 'how can I make
the damn novel work?"'
He explained the technique
with one of his favorite fancy
literary terms: metalepsis,
the recurrence of characters
throughout a body of work.
"I think of all of my novels as
little individual chapters of my
uber novel," he explained.
Mitchell will be leading a fic-
tion workshop in Angell Hall
Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. and he.
will host a smaller, more exten-
sive Q&A in the Hopwood Room
Thursday at 2:00 p.m. Later
on Thursday, he will return to
UMMA for another book signing
as well as a lecture in the Helmut
Stern Auditorium, where he will
discuss what fiction is made of.
He gave a little sneak peak of
the lecture, explaining that in
addition to the usual story com-
ponents such as plot, character
and style, fiction is made up of
"little bits," which, according to
Mitchell, is a technical term.
But don't stroke his ego. Mitch-
ell doesn't think he's as clever as
everyone makes him out to be.
"I'm going to have trouble
flying back, because my head
is going to exceed my baggage
allowance," he said.

Krysten Ritter's Chloe is the
kooky comedic relief and James
Van Der Beek plays himself as
the vain douchebag found on
just about any sitcom these days
- and infused them with a car-
toonish hyperbole and wacki-
ness that's simply irresistible.
The show's oddball voice is like
nothing else on television.
And now, it returns with a
funeral. ."Dawson's Creek" 's
funeral, to be exact. Realizing
he holds on too tightly to his
past, JVDB piles memories of
his Dawson.days into.a rowboat.
and lights it on fire. The funeral

is most likely a wink from the
writers signaling less reliance
on "Creek"-fueled jokes for easy
laughs. There are only so many
times Paula Cole's "I Don't Want
to Wait" can be used as a punch-
line - just kidding, that musical
masterpiece is comedy gold, not
to mention timeless.
We don't wanna
wait for the
next episode.
So of course, the episode goes
out with a bang. Literally, with
the characters walking away
from their past "as it explodes
behind them like a John Woo
movie." But also with some of its
best meta jokes to date, welcom-
ing guest stars Busy Philipps
and Frankie Muniz - hopefully
the first of many self-parodying
guests this season - into its
whimsy.
The specificity of much of
"Apartment 23" 's humor makes
it wonderfully bizarre, but can
also be isolating. For those of
uswho.are like the teen,drama-_
loving June, hearing JVDB muse

on how Joshua Jackson is in love
with him and listening to a pep
talk from Mark-Paul Gosselaar
(new goal: buy a shih-tzu and
name it Dog-Paul Gosselaar)
can be a near-religious experi-
ence. The rapid-fire references
can get even more obscure than
those of super-geeky "Com-
munity," demanding expansive
knowledge held by only creme
de la creme Pop Culturatti.
Those unfamiliar with the more
obscure references are left feel-
ing like that lame kid who's on
the outside of all the inside jokes.
'But fortunately, "Apartment
23" also excels in more perva-
sive comedy - particularly of
the visual nature - with the
acid-tongued Chloe usually at
the forefront of such antics. It'd
be impossible not to melt into a
fit of hysterics when Chloe ever
so casuallytakes people out with
tranquilizers.
Chloe is sadly underused in
the pilot, but still lands the best
lines ("You're at a fame interven-
tion sitting next to a hot-ass ho
packing a tranq gun"). And her
scarcity in the A-plot is a telltale
sign of growth for the series,
which can easily slip into the
confines of a one-woman show.
Much of the first season relied
on Ritter's deft handling of her
character's side-splitting insani-
ty. But June and JVDB are at the
forefront of "A Reunion ... ", and
neither needs to lean too heavily
on Chloe to elicit laugh attacks
(though, "rack attacks" on the
other hand ...).
It's still a newborn by TV
standards, but "Apartment 23"
is growing' up fast, and has
already crafted some of its own
inside jokes: The premiere calls
back to the tastemaker trifecta,
a gay Asian hipster ("Arigato,
heeeeey!").
But more importantly, "A
Reunion ... " begins to demolish
some of the pigeonholes its char-
acters found themselves slip-
ping into in the show's first few
episodes, with June and JVDB
essentially vying to become
more developed characters.
Walker and Van Der Beek are
still overshadowed by Ritter's
scene-stealing splendor (or per-
haps by Chloe's "big-ass hat!"),
but "Apartment 23" has time
to secure its footing, and in the
meantime, it's still making us
laugh-cry with its absurdity.

Beauchamp-Sayraf said she
experienced the benefits of col-
lective bargaining firsthand
during her union's last negotia-
tion with UMHS. Prior to nego-
tiations, there was no minimum
rest period required between a
worker's on-call hours and his
or her regularly scheduled shift.
However, after union discus-
sions, the nurses at the Universi-
ty Hospital now have a minimum
nine-hour rest period between
the two duties.
Dawn Kettinger, the com-
munications director of the
Michigan Nurses Association,
said there are currently no laws
regarding issues like maximum
hours and the number of patients
per nurse, making the proposal
an important provision.
"We're working very hard
to pass this proposal because
of what it means to our nurses:
having a voice and being able to
advocate for the safety of their
patients" Kettinger said.
Beauchamp-Sayraf said hav-
ing well-rested nurses automati-
cally increases the quality of
patient care.
"I can tell you that there is
a world of difference between
my nursing career outside of a
unionized hospital, where I had
no representation, and the expe-
rience that I have now, with rep-
resentation," Beauchamp-Sayraf
said. "The difference is incred-
ible."
She added that she hopes the
proposal will pass to ensure all
locations of employment have
the opportunity to participate in
collective bargaining. She noted
that a well-rested nursing staff
leads to fewer medical errors,
which ultimately brings down
health care costs.
"I think a lot of times, admin-
istrators lose that aspect of the
bottom line," she said. "When
you have adequate nurse staff-
ing, that is the most cost-effec-
tive way to deliver safe care."

the country that this is not that
unusual," Coleman told SACUA.
However, in the report among
a group of other institutions, the
University seemed to have the
worst relationship between the
Department of Public Safety and
Hospital Security. The reported
noted at other schools includ-
ing Ohio State University and
the University of Chicago, their
security units were more effi-
cient at their work and coopera-
tive in their functions.
GENERAL COUNSEL
SEARCH ALMOST OVER
Coleman also noted that pos-
sible candidates for the Univer-
sity's next general counsel have
been found and that the search is
in its "final stages."
In March, Law School Prof.
Suellyn Scarnecchia, the Uni-
versity's former vice president
and general counsel announced
she was stepping down to take at
faculty position at the lawschool.
Debra Kowich was appointed the
interim general counsel in May.
Previously she served as an asso-
ciate general counsel leading the
public higher education practice
group.
COLEMAN, HANLON
PRAISE COURSERA"
University Provost Philip
Hanlon also spoke at the meeting
FULBRIGHTS

in the Fulbright program," Peck-
ens said. "Our grantees worked
very hard to develop their pro-
posals and we are proud to have
them representing the Univer-
sity in their various host coun-
tries."
Ken Kollman, the director of
the University's International
Institute, said the experiences
made possible by Fulbright are
"life-changing" and often help
people in their future careers.
"For many (participants),
it catapults their careers into
either newer academic fields or
into areas of professional activity
involving expertise in a particu-
lar country, expertise in par-
ticular realms of international
transactions and international
negotiations," Kollman said.
Kollman said he is pleased
with the hard work of the Uni-
versity students, adding that the
advising staff is also dedicated
to helping students during the
application process for future
programs.
"I'm just very proud of them
and also wish them the best, and
just thinkthey are what this Uni-
versity stands for," Kollman said.
"They can focus on a specific
project but at the same time put
it in enough context that people
that are funding these positions
see these as important not only
for the people but for the regions
and areas of the world that
they're going to."
LSA graduate and current Ful-

and answered questions at the
meeting. Hanlon and Coleman
both mentioned the importance
of digital learning and lauded the
University's role in the progress
of Coursera, a free online web-
site offering a variety of not-for-
credit courses from universities
around the world.
"The courses have been really
interesting, and the enrollments
have run between about 20,000
and 130,000" Hanlon said. "They
seem to have attracted quite a
bit of interest. I think it's been
really a positive thing for our
campus. There's been a lot of fac-
ulty interest; that means that our
faculty are creative, thinking of
possibilities, and that's what we
expect."
They noted that while many
students signed up for the Uni-
versity's courses, only 10 to 15
percent have completed them,
which Coleman attributes to the
need for personal interactions
between professors and stu-
dents.
"When everything is virtual,
the physical becomes more pre-
cious," Coleman said.
FACULTY QUESTION
PROVOST OVER BUDGET
Faculty questioned Hanlon
about providing more grant-
based financial aid to Detroit stu-
dents in light of a recent pledge
by the University of Chicago to
assist students in the city.
Hanlon said it was not a fair
comparison because while pri-
vate institutions like the Uni-
versity of Chicago are able to
bright grantee Elizabeth Koselka
graduated lastspringafter study-
ing anthropology and Spanish.
She is currently in Madrid, Spain
pursuing an English teaching
assistantship.
"For me, this is my first real,
new experience of really get-
ting to know new people and a
new lifestyle, so that is opening
my eyes a lot to all of the other
opportunities that will follow,"
Koselka said in a phone inter-
view. "All of it is an adventure.
Every dayI challenge (myself) to
do something I could riot do last
year."
Koselka, an Ann Arbor native,
said since her program started in
the beginning of September, she
has been adjusting to her new
lifestyle and trying to immerse
herself in the culture.
"I'm also very excited to have
that moment where I feel like
I belong totally in Madrid,"
Koselka said. "I'm definitely still
clearly foreign, and I'm looking
forward to when people ask me
directions. That's sort of a thrill
for me."
Koselka added that she hopes
the program will help in the
future when she applies for a
Ph.D. in anthropology, and said
she ultimately wants to work as a
professor of social anthropology.
"I feel much more confident
applying for that specific oppor-
tunity after having this ... field

sity starts off by offering reduced
in-state tuition to every resident,
utilizing a lot of funding that
could be otherwise. allocated
toward financial aid.
He added that $100 million is
given to students in grants every
year, and the discount given to
in-state students totals about
$440 million.
SACUA members also ques-
tioned Hanlon about the budget
and the rising cost of tuition, and
urged the University to be more
transparent about what goes
into the budget and what causes
tuition increases.
Hanlon admitted that at an
average increase of slightly
more than 5 percent annually
was "pretty high," but said most
of the increases were due to
decreases in federal and state aid
and increases in financial aid.
He added that the University
had done well cutting costs com-
pared to other universities, not-
ing that only 2.3 of the 5-percent
annual increases were because of
increased costs.
Hanlon said despite the effi-
ciencies provided through cost
cutting programs, they might
hurt the University in national
rankings such as the U.S. News
and World Report, which consid-
er the expenditure-per-student
ratio in its decisions.
"The more you spend, the
higher you're going to get
ranked," he said. "If there was
ever a disincentive to operate
efficiently, it's right there."
pana, an English and Russian
double major and Fulbright
grantee pursuing an English
teaching assistantship in Mos-
cow, Russia, said in an e-mail
interview he hopes to teach his
Russian peers about the reali-
ties of American culture.
"I'm hoping to achieve a bet-
ter understanding of this coun-
try, given its rocky history with
the United States," Campana
said. "Most of the people I've
talked to have this fairytale idea
of what constitutes America and
it's been great gaining and clari-
fying that perspective. It's amaz-
ing how much more I've learned
aboutour country by living here,
and I kind of want to take that
knowledge back home."
Andrew Kohler, who received
his Ph.D. in musicology from the
University, is in Germany using
his Fulbright grant to continue
research for his dissertation on
German composer Carl Orff. He
said in an e-mail interview the
grant also provided him with a
six-week course to improve his
German.
"Fulbright also provides a net-
work of support, both in terms
of the other grantees, who have
proven to be wonderful friends,
and through the office, which
has been helpful in getting us
settled with all of the necessary
paperwork," Kohler said.
Kohler added that though
gathering data and using the
grant to finish his dissertation
by May 2014 is his primary goal,
he also hopes to also enjoy his

time in Germany on a personal
level.


ZNGERMAN'S
From Page 1
wich line manager saved the life
of an elderly woman living in the
Kingsley Street home.
Zingerman's bought the prop-
erty, which serves as the ground
for the new, two-story rectan-
gular expansion. Previously,
the eatery rented out available
property in the area to fill the
urgent need for space. Saginaw
said having the chance to design
a building for Zingerman's was a
rewarding experience.
"We've never been able to
occupy a building that was
designed with intention," Sagi-
naw said. "It was always what-
ever we could do in the moment
to create the space, and that's
why this building matters so
much to us, because we actually
could think about the best possi-
ble way to serve our guests, serve
our staff and grow from the foun-
dation that we landed in in the
beginning."
The new building offers many
amenities to improve the work of
employees. A receiving area is a
first for Zingerman's, which pre-
viously conducted deliveries on
the streets. New prep areas in the
basement will assist Zingerman's
Catering and the deli. In-house
refrigerators will eliminate the
need for employees to run outside
to fetch food products. The new
area will also connect to the cur-
rent deli via an atrium that will be
built in upcoming months.
"The whole basement will be
interconnected," Saginaw said.
"it will be like a magical under-
ground city."
Customers will utilize the new
building on the first and second
floors. Punchy colors and graph-
ics featuring Zingerman's des-
serts and delicacies paint the
walls, keeping with the Zinger-
man's brand aesthetic. New seat-
ing areas, includinga south porch
with retractable garage doors and
a second floor patio, will almost
double the amount of seating in
the eatery.
The design of the expansion
differs slightly from the Zinger-
man's Next Door Coffee House,
the current site of all Zingerman's
customer seating. Additions in
the expansion include various re-

used items, including a wooden
bench made from a spruce tree
demolished orr the property.
Saginaw said sustainability was
a key factor in the expansion; the
eatery hopes to receive Leader-
ship in Energy and Environment
Design certification from the U.S.
Green Building Council for its
efforts.
For customers visiting the deli,
Saginaw explained the experi-
ence will remain the same, with
patrons entering through the
deli and walking through the
retail section of the store before
approaching a glass case and
ordering station in the new atri-
um.
Zingerman's marketing man-
ager Pete Sickman-Garner said
the retail space in the current deli
area will expand after operations
are moved to the new kitchen and
the current kitchen is torn down.
"We can convert all that square
footage into retail space, and it
won't nearly be as crowded for
shopping," Sickman-Garner said.
The final new area for cus-
tomers is the cash register area,
which sits inside an electrid
blue house. Sickman-Garner
explained that the house was
moved in 1902 from the corner
of Detroit and Kingsley streets
when a grocery store was built
in its place. That grocery store
became Zingerman's in 1982,
when Paul Saginaw and Ari
Weinzweig founded the deli.
Original plans for the expan-
sion did not include the building,
but the Ann Arbor Historic Dis-
trict Commission required the
historic building remain stand-
ing. Sickman-Garner explained
the house was moved again to
make room for the new building,
and it was gutted and renovated
completely to create the new
check-out area.
"Looking at it now, I think it
kind of gives the whole thing a
funky character," Sickman-Gar-
ner said.
Along with the new addi-
tions, technological updates
can be found throughout the
eatery, including iPads for tak-
ing orders and a new station for
picking up and purchasing call-
in orders. For Saginaw, this new
change seems daunting, butnec-
essary.
"It's hard when you've done
everything by hand for 30 years

to suddenly switch over to elec-
tronic is very hard," she said.
"There are huge efficiencies
to it, and we've already cut the
sandwich making time in half."
Even with iPads, Zingerman's
classic style still remains, with
stands crafted from re-used
pickle buckets to hold the devic-
es.
With the new building, Sagi-
naw said about 60 new jobs will
be created within the eatery.
Zingerman's Co-founder Paul
Saginaw said he hopes the new
expansion will meld with the
rest of the eatery.
"We wanted to carry the look
and feel of the last 30 years over
into the new building, but we
certainly wanted to have better
public restrooms and better seat-
ing and improve production,"
Saginaw said, referring to the
new, modern restrooms in the
expansion.
Art & Design freshman Stu-
art Rosemurgy, a Zingerman's
employee, said the large expan-
sion seemed overwhelming ini-
tially.
"I didn't like it at first, but
after learning the ropes, I started
to really like it," Rosemurgy said,
adding that he thinks the expan-
sion matches the aesthetic of the
other buildings in the eatery.
LSA freshman Kendall Gor-
don, who was visiting the deli
with friends, said she was excit-
ed that the additional seating
wouldreduce time when trying
to find a table.
Along with the deli, Zinger-
man's owns eight other busi-
nesses in Ann Arbor that are
independently managed, Sick-
man-Garner said. He added the
renovation of the deli is the larg-
est renovation project for the
company, which cost about $6.7
million.
With the opening of the
expansion, Saginaw said with
the deli will face new challenges
in shifting over to a different sys-
tem.
"This is the biggest expan-
sion, renovation that any of the
businesses have ever done. And
the scariest," Saginaw said.
"Because we like to do our best,
and we like to do everything
right and we know we'll make
mistakes, but we want to make as
few as possible. And so, this is a
big threshold for us to Cross."

anybody. and how Bellomy looked on Sat-

urday, it perhaps hasn't been
enough to adequately prepare
them for extended game action.
While Robinson's teammates
will doubtless be happy to see
their starting quarterback return,
the typical mantra for the Wol-
verines is that any player on the
team is expected to perform if his
number is called. That naturally
leads to starters having confi-
dence in backups and supporting
them too, even though they may
not have ideal experience.
Redshirt junior offensive line-
man Taylor Lewan gave voice
to those sentiments on Monday,
responding to criticism he had
heard of Bellomy's play.
"Nothing changes at all for
me," Lewan said of the difference
in the offense when Robinson
isn't under center. "I think - I
have 100 percent faith in Russell.
I think it was a tough situation to
go in.
"Any person that thinks, 'Well,
I could've done a better job,'
no, you couldn't have. Ninety-
thousand screaming fans in red
shirts, screaming at you, you're a
redshirt freshman, that's a tough
situation for anybodyto be in."
Though most would agree that
the offense should see a boost if
Robinson is back under center,
Lewan doesn't see it that way -
he's focused simply on getting
better production, no matter
who's leadingthe attack.
"We just got to finish the game.
Got to put the ball in the end
zone, especially when we're in
the red zone," he said.

With the Michigan football
team's loss at Nebraska last Sat-
urday, the Wolverines no lon-
ger control their own destiny en
route to the Big Ten Champion-
ship in India-
napolis. NOTEBOOK
Michigan
(3-1 Big Ten, 5-3 overall) and
Nebraska (3-1, 6-2) are now tied
atop the Legends Division in the
conference standings, but the
Cornhuskers have the advantage
in the tiebreaker because they
won head-to-head against the
Wolverines. So, even if Michigan
wins each of its final four games
- at Minnesota, home against
Northwestern and Iowa, and at
Ohio State - Nebraska would
still go tothe championship game
if it also wins out.
"I don't think anyone in our
locker room is doubting any-
thing," said senior defensive end
Craig Roh. "All we can do right
now is win these four games, and
that's all the power we have. And
then everything else is up to a
higher power."
In practice, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke has been preaching
to his team that every week is a
championship week. That is, each
matchup in conference play is
immensely important if the team
wants to. reach that champion-
ship game. Now, the situation is
more dire, and if the Wolverines
lose again, they could all but kiss
their title dreams goodbye.
At home against Minnesota
last season, Michigan trounced
thevisitors, 58-0, to keep the cov-
eted Brown Jug trophy in Ann
Arbor. The Wolverines would
like to keep the jug resting in
Schembechler Hall, but they care
more about the grander implica-
tions of the matchup.
"I'm playing to win a Big Ten
Championship," said redshirt
junior offensive tackle Taylor
Lewan. "The Brown Jug, it's a
nice trophy, I want to win the tro-
phy, want to keep it in Michigan.

MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Wolverines triumph
vs. Texas, Indiana

Goalies still splitting time for 'M'

The Michigan men's swim-
ming and diving team needed no
extra motivation.
The Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten,
4-0 overall) entered the Lee and
Joe Jamail Swimming Center
looking for their second consecu-
tive win over No. 5 Texas and No.
8 Indiana. Just half of a point sep-
arated Michigan from the Long-
horns in a loss last year, and the
Wolverines looked to come away
with a more assertive win this
-fall.
"Our guys get excited to com-
pete against the best, and Texas
is one of the best in the country
and Indiana one of the best in the
Big Ten," said Michigan assistant
head coach Josh White. "So not
much was needed to be said, they
were ready to go and compete."
After amassing 23 event wins
over the two days, a 194-106 vic-
tory over Texas and a 223-77 vic-
tory overthe Hoosiers, it would be
fair to say the mission was accom-
plished.
Michigan jumped to an early
lead with a pair of first-place fin-
ishes from junior Connor Jaeger
in the 1,000-yard freestyle and
the 200-yard individual medley
relay.
"Everything just went really
well for us," said junior John
Wojciechowski. "Everyone was
really intense, we got a good lead
and I think that was the main dif-
ference."
Wojciechowski helped the
Wolverines build on their lead
with a first-place finish in the
100-yard butterfly in 47.98 sec-
onds - -an NCAA consideration
time. Wojciechowski registered
two more first-place finishes on

Saturday, bringing his final tally
to three.
"It was really nice to win the
100 fly," Wojciechowski said. "It's
nice to be an active part of the
team again and get a win for the
team."
Freshman Dylan Bosh also
chipped in with a win in the
200-yard breaststroke and a sec-
ond-place finish in the 100-yard
breaststroke. The two-time Big
Ten freshmen swimmer of the
week clocked in at 1:45.46 and
48.06 in the respective events -
both NCAA consideration times.
"We hoped that he would
be one of the swimmers in the
NCAAs," White said. "He's get-
ting there a little bit quicker than
we expected. He's just done a
great job of really being relaxed
and taking everything in stride."
Senior Miguel Ortiz rounded
out the headlines by tallying four
first-place finishes over the two-
day meet. On Friday, he clocked
in at 47.82 in the 100-yard back-
stroke - an NCAA consideration
time - and 20.26 in the 50-yard
freestyle. On Saturday, he repli-
cated his success in the 50-yard
freestyle.
But with all of their success and
dominance, the Wolverines' per-
formance wasn't flawless.
"The biggest thing right now
is people's turns and work-
ing on their finishes or starts,"
Wojciechowski said. "With all the
hard days, the hard trainig, per-
haps we haven't been ableto work
on the details. -opefully within
the next month we'll start being
more efficient and work on the
little details."
Michigan will have plenty of
time to iron out the kinks before
taking on Big Ten rival Purdue on
Nov.16.

Coming off a series split with
Miami (Ohio) last weekend, the
No. 8 Michigan hockey team still
has some uncertainties at the
goaltender position.
But with two freshmen goal-
ies, uncertainties are expected.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
has played Steve Racine and Jared
Rutledge equally so far.
On Friday against the Red-
Hawks, Racine recorded 30 saves
and allowed two goals to earn
his third win of the season. A
day later, when the Wolverines'
third-period collapse allowed a
Miami victory, Rutledge took the
loss after allowing four goals on
35 shots.
"I thought (Racine) battled
hard throughout the game and
made the saves that he's capable
of making and maybe a couple
that he shouldn't have made,"
Berenson said after Friday
night's victory.
And he had a similar senti-
ment on Saturday in regards to
Rutledge's play, even after the
Chicago, Ill. native allowed four
goals in the loss.
"(Rutledge) gave us a chance,"
Berenson said. "I thought he
played a good game and we just
didn't give him the kind of sup-
port you need to give your goal-
ie."
During Saturday's loss, there
were some defensive lapses that
allowed Miami to have an advan-
tage deep in the zone. But a cou-
ple of the goals came off of shots
that Rutledge possibly should've
stopped.
Miscues or not, both goalies'
statistics are beginning to speak
for themselves. Racine is 3-0
and has allowed 2.33 goals per
game on the year. In comparison,
Rutledge is 0-2 with 4.52 goals
allowed per game. Berenson has

Freshman goaltender Jared Rutledge, who is rotating in net, has strugged in is first few starts for Michigan this fall.

said throughout the season that
he is looking for a goalie who will
give the team the best chance,
and that is exactly what Racine
has done. Berenson wouldn't
comment specifically on wheth-
er Racine will be the starter for
both games this weekend when
Michigan travels to play North-
ern Michigan, though.
"We're looking for our goalies
to get better in all of the things
- I can give you a laundry list of
the all things the goalies have to
do to get better," he said. "(Vol-
unteer goaltending coach Josh
Blackburn) will work with them
tomorrow and maybe Wednes-
day, and then we'll make a deci-
sion of who looks most ready and
so on.
"But coming out of the first
five games, Racine definitely has
shown that he can play."
This is the first time that
Berenson has even hinted that
Racine might have an edge.
Berenson said that the goalie
dilemma isn't the main problem,

though. He is more concerned
with the entire team getting on
track than his two freshman
goalies' performance, especially
since this weekend marks the
first road series of the year for the
Wolverines.
And what does the constant
question mark of who will start
and who will, sit do for the two
younggoalies?
"It actually keeps us pretty
focused because any opportunity
you get you need to be at your
best," Racine said.
Berenson insists progress on
that laundry list will help deter-
mine who the starter is, but that's
not necessarily the only determi-
nant.
"I'd say that things like posi-
tioning, puck-handling, quick-
ness, being alert, being ready for
a quick shot and not being sur-
prised by shots and being aware
ofwhatthe situation is," he said.
One of those aspects which
Racine said he needed to work
on was his puck-handling. On

more than one occasion Fri-
day, he errantly passed the puck
behind the net, which resulted
in a defensive-zone turnover.
The puck went directly to an
opposing player one time, and
that turnover ultimately led to a
Miami goal.
Despite both goalies' fresh-
man status, the 21-year-old
Racine has an age factor over
the 18-year-old Rutledge. Racine
played two years in the United
States Hockey League with
three different teams, and then
last year was the starting goalie
for Georgetown of the Ontario
Junior Hockey League. Beren-
son insists neither has the edge,
but as the season progresses, one
goalie will likely grab the start-
ing position for the long haul.
Until then, they'll likely split the
starts in goal.
"They've got a lot to work on,"
Berenson said. "But I can tell
you I like both these goalies and
there's some things that each one
of them has to clean-up."
