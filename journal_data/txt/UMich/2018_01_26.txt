Morgan 
McCaul 
entered 

Michigan 
State’s 
medicine 

clinic at the age of 12. At the 
time, McCaul — now an LSA 
freshman at the University of 
Michigan — was an aspiring 
ballerina with tears in both hip 
flexors. 

She went to East Lansing 

in search of world-renowned 
doctor Larry Nassar with hopes 
he could provide her with the 
help she needed to return to 
dance.

Nearly 
five 
years 
later, 

McCaul realized she had been 
sexually assaulted by Nassar 
under the guise of medical 
treatment. McCaul had seen 
Nassar as the physician she 
wanted to be. Instead, she 
was a victim of his abuse and 
manipulation.

“I was your little ‘goof’ and so 

I looked to you as a role model, 
hoping to volunteer at MSU 
Sports Medicine alongside you 
someday,” 
McCaul’s 
impact 

statement 
read. 
“Do 
you 

remember taking me out to 
lunch after I job-shadowed you 
at the Clinic? I still have our 
friendly Facebook messages. In 
my mind, you were my both my 

mentor and my friend.”

McCaul is small in stature, 

just like she was when she met 
Nassar. Yet that hasn’t stopped 
her from finding her voice. She 
is no longer a victim — instead, 
she is a survivor.

On Nov. 22, 2017, Nassar — 

who earned his undergraduate 
degree in kinesiology at the 
University — pleaded guilty to 
seven counts of first-degree 
sexual misconduct in Ingham 
County Circuit Court. A week 
later, he pleaded guilty to 
another three counts of first-
degree sexual misconduct in 
Eaton County for treatments he 
administered at the Twistars 
Gymnastics Club in Dimondale. 
 

McCaul 
was 
involved 
in 

both civil and criminal suits 
against Nassar. She was never 
involved in John Geddert’s 
Twistars Gymnastics Club or 
USA 
Gymnastics, 
something 

she is grateful for, as more 
information about misconduct 
within those organizations is 
uncovered.

“I feel really lucky that I was 

not in their care,” McCaul said. 
“I still feel passionately that 
those institutions need to be 
held accountable.”

As the date of Nassar’s 

sentencing hearing approached, 
McCaul and fellow survivors 
spent more and more time 
appealing 
to 
the 
press 
to 

ensure the sentencing received 
coverage. Since then, McCaul 
has been one of the leading 
voices in the press. 

That means she hasn’t had 

the conventional first semester 
than most freshmen have. She 
has spent her first few months 
of college commuting between 
Ann Arbor and her home in Lake 
Odessa, attending class on the 
weekdays and legal meetings on 
the weekends.

McCaul and other survivors 

attended 
MSU 
Board 
of 

Trustees meetings throughout 
the fall, pressing them to take 
action. No one seemed to be 
listening, neither the trustees 
nor the media. 

Sentencing began Jan. 16, 

originally intended to end Jan. 
19, with 90 survivors slated to 
give impact statements. The 
Monday before the hearing, all 
90 survivors regrouped before 
the trial.

“We were able to sit in a room 

and chat and see each other’s 
faces,” McCaul recalled. “It’s 
really empowering.”

And then Judge Rosemarie 

Aquilina made a decision to 
allow all survivors a chance 
to speak and confront Nassar. 
As 
the 
hearing 
continued, 

the 
number 
of 
individuals 

delivering impact statements 
grew from 90 to 156. That didn’t 

And so that’s what I did. I spent my childhood 

practicing fouette turns and tour jetes, my 
summers 
preparing 
for 
Cecchetti 
ballet 

examinations, and every moment in between 
dreaming up choreography for a performance of 
my own. Dance was my life’s passion, my greatest 
combatant yet my greatest joy. It was my art, and 
it was my sport.

But, it is also the vehicle which drove my 

unassuming body into Larry Nassar’s office.

Larry, when I was just twelve years old, I 

walked into your office at the Michigan State 
University Sports Medicine Clinic, in tremendous 
pain and seeking help to return to the sport that 
I loved most. I was in the 7th grade, I stood at a 
towering 4 foot 10, and in you, I saw not only the 
medical help I so desperately needed after tearing 
both of my hip flexors... 

I saw a physician that I aspired to be. I was your 

little “goof” and so I looked to you as a role model, 
hoping to volunteer at MSU Sports Medicine 
alongside you someday. Do you remember taking 
me out to lunch after I job-shadowed you at 
the Clinic? I still have our friendly Facebook 
messages. In my mind, you were my both my 
mentor and my friend.

And it wasn’t until 2016 that I realized that 

you molested me.

Every shred of admiration I had for you is 

gone. Every excuse I told my twelve-year-old-
self when you were penetrating me is gone. The 
man I thought I knew did not exist. Only a selfish 
predator, whose atrocities know no bounds. You 
violated the very principal of your calling as a 
former physician: 
 

Do. No. Harm.
This past year and a half has been, without a 

doubt, the most difficult and traumatic period of 
my life. Your betrayal has caused me countless 
sleepless nights; when I do find sleep, I’m 

plagued with nightmares and when I wake up, 
I’m living one. This has ruined my first year at 
the University of Michigan and robbed me of the 
college experience every young girl deserves. 

Most tragic of all is that your crime has 

shaken my very image of myself... this sentiment 
has been echoed by hundreds of other women 
who’ve shared their most painful memories with 
this courtroom. It is perhaps your most vile 
transgression.

But alas, Larry, you are merely a symptom of a 

sickness which plagues the very core of Michigan 
State University, threatening every little girl who 
steps foot on that campus; a culture of sexual 
abuse and the perverse, deliberate inaction to 
hold predators accountable. 

In the aftermath of Nassar’s crimes, calls have 

been renewed for MSU President, Lou Anna K. 
Simon, to resign. The fact that she has yet to do so 
is insulting to the hundreds of survivors like me--
-it is, in fact, 42 months, countless slanderous 
public statements by Jason Cody, calls from 
numerous Congressmen and -women, and one 
one-hundred and fifty thousand dollar slap-in-
the-face of a raise too late.

Since reports of Larry Nassar’s misconduct 

to Michigan State faculty began in 1997, two 
years before I was even born, I can’t help but 
wonder: 

How many little girls could have been spared 

from this lifelong battle, if someone at the 
University had done the bare minimum and 
listened ?

Judge Aquilina, I implore you to impose 

a sentence against this man which sends an 
unmistakable message to those who perpetrate 
heinous crimes against young people; whether 
they molest and maim, or look the other way to 
protect their Green-And-White.

Thank you, your honor.

MORGAN MCCAUL’S IMPACT STATEMENT

See NASSAR, Page 2

When I was just two years old, I witnessed a production of 

Alice In Wonderland. It was full of dazzling dance numbers 

which captured my tiny heart, and I knew right then and 

there, I wanted to be a ballerina when I grew up. 


even include statements from 
survivors’ family members and 
support systems. 

McCaul delivered her impact 

statement 
Friday 
afternoon 

with her dance instructor by 
her side.

“This past year and a half 

has been, without a doubt, the 
most difficult and traumatic 
period of my life,” McCaul said 
in her statement.

During the first week of 

sentencing, an investigation 
from 
The 
Detroit 
News 

revealed MSU President Lou 
Anna Simon and 13 other 
MSU officials knew of the 
survivor reports and Title IX 
investigations into Nassar in 
2014. State legislators, media 
outlets and students began to 

call for Simon’s resignation. 
McCaul’s 
impact 
statement 

echoed that sentiment.

“In the aftermath of Nassar’s 

crimes, 
calls 
have 
been 

renewed for MSU President, 
Lou Anna K. Simon, to resign,” 
McCaul said. “The fact that she 
has yet to do so is insulting to 
the hundreds of survivors like 
me — it is, in fact, 42 months, 
countless 
slanderous 
public 

statements by Jason Cody, calls 
from numerous Congressmen 
and women and one $150,000 
slap-in-the-face of a raise too 
late.”

According to a 2016 lawsuit, 

one of the first survivors — an 
Olympic gymnast — stated 
Nassar sexually abused her in 
1994, years before McCaul was 
even born.

“How many little girls could 

have been spared from this 
lifelong battle,” McCaul said, “if 
someone at the university had 

done the bare minimum and 
listened?”

Though the hearing extended 

beyond Friday, McCaul and 
many fellow survivors decided 
to stay until Nassar received 
his final sentence. McCaul will 
have missed nearly two weeks 
of school for the hearing, but 
supporting the women who 
continued to come forward was 
too important to her.

“Coming back I feel is really 

important because a lot of 
statements that have been given 
in the past few days reference 
the community of survivors 
and how people feel more 
comfortable sharing their story, 
and they only found their voice 
as a result of people that came 
before,” McCaul said. “So I 
want to be here and show them 
were still here for them I want 
to learn their names I want to 
give them a hug, show them that 
we are here for them.”

McCaul’s 
lawyers 

originally brought seven 
of the survivors together. 
The group went through 
mediation 
together 

and 
formed 
a 
lasting 

connection.

“But we really bonded 

in 
a 
way 
that 
was 

unanticipated,” 
McCaul 

said. “We knew that we 
would get along but we talk 
every day, we’ve gone out to 
dinner together, we’ve gone 
over to each other’s houses. 
We speak every day. It kind 
of set the grounds like we 
need to start a community, 
we need the relief that we 
felt from meeting each 
other.”

One 
of 
the 
women 

McCaul 
spoke 
with 

was 
Jessica 
Smith, 
a 

survivor who created the 
#MeTooMSU 
Facebook 

group, a forum to share 
stories and raise awareness 
of the culture of abuse 
plaguing MSU’s campus.

McCaul 
demanded 

Aquilina 
deliver 
the 

strongest sentence.

“Judge Aquilina, I implore 

you to impose a sentence 
against this man which sends 
an unmistakable message to 
those who perpetrate heinous 
crimes against young people,” 
McCaul said. “Whether they 
molest and maim, or look the 
other way to protect their 
Green-and-White.” 

Aquilina took note of the 

powerful community of women 
and girls she dubbed “sister 
survivors” she saw in her 
courtroom. Following the final 
impact statement from survivor 
Rachael 
Denhollander, 
the 

first woman to go public with 
accusations in 2016, Aquilina 
said, “You built an army of 
survivors, and you are the five-
star general.” 

No one knew what to expect 

going into the first day of 
sentencing. But McCaul had an 
idea of how emotional it would 
be.

“We had no way to prepare 

ourselves for what this was 
going to look like and that 
first day was so difficult, it 
was so cathartic, so intensely 
emotional that it was really 
hard to deal with,” McCaul said. 
“And I don’t think — and I mean 
media cover can only do so 
much, live stream can only do 
so much — but it is so different 
to watch it from a screen than 
to be in that room and feel that 
energy. And to be in a room 
with him. To see Larry after all 
of this is crazy. “

Eight days and 156 impact 

statements 
later, 
each 
as 

powerful as the one before, 
Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 
40 to 175 years in state prison. 

Before 
delivering 
her 

sentence, Aquilina reminded 
the room and all watching on 
the livestream, 1 in 10 children 
are abused before their 18th 
birthday, calling for change.

“Speak 
out 
like 
these 

survivors, become part of the 
army.”

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind 
the scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This 
week, Public policy junior Andrew Hiyama covered the 
sentencing of Larry Nassar, the MSU doctor who pleaded 
guilty to molesting hundreds of his patients.

“By the time we got there, the courtroom was already 
insanely crowded and there was only room for one of the 
three reporters we brought to actually get in. The other two 
of us had to stay in an overflow room with the proceedings 
being shown on a TV. Even so, not physically being there, 
all of the victims’ testimonies were incredibly powerful. 
Aly Raisman, an Olympic gold medalist, stood up there and 
told Larry Nassar, who in some ways had ruined the lives of 
hundreds of women and girls, that he was nothing. Overall, it 
was a very intense experience.“

Public policy junior Andrew Hiyama, “Nassar sentenced to 
40-175 years in prison for sex abuse”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
The choice to label the series ‘Free Speech and 

Inclusion’ is not only complicit with the framing imposed 
by right-wing agitators, but also risks to undermine the 
important efforts to make our campus a more equitable 
place where we confront white supremacy head on and 
don’t just throw around empty, sanitized language that 
allows us to celebrate an increasingly hollow-sounding 
concept of ‘inclusion’.“

steady income can make all the

Schandevel wrote in an email

Friday, January 26, 2018 — 3

The University of Michigan’s 

Central Student Government 
released a Campus Affordability 
Guide Saturday and has since 
received backlash from many 
members of the student body. 
The online publication was 
widely touted as a “guide to 
cost-effective 
living 
at 
the 

University,” and lists a few 
dozen tips for students to cut 
down on costs in the face of 
rising living costs. 

Suggestions such as cutting 

down 
on 
housekeeping 

services, laundry delivery or 
limiting 
impulse 
purchases 

left 
low-income 
students 

incredulous. 

In a Facebook post that has 

been shared 27 times as of 
Thursday evening, LSA senior 
Zoe Proegler expressed her 
dissatisfaction with the way 
CSG approached affordability 
on campus.

“We all know Ann Arbor is 

expensive,” 
Proegler 
wrote. 

“Guides like this, which lecture 
to lower income students about 
how rich people think poor 
people can change a couple 
habits (or lightbulbs?) and not 
be poor anymore, do not help. 
Rather, they’re a slap in the 
face to people who fight every 
day to be here.”

A 2016 demographic self-

survey 
conducted 
by 
CSG 

in 2016 found 74.4 percent 
of its members come from 
households 
that 
earn 
over 

$100,000 a year, and 37.2 
percent 
have 
household 

incomes 
of 
over 
$250,000. 

According to a recent report, 
the 
University 
ranks 
last 

in economic mobility when 
compared to other top-ranked 
public universities.

“It was really immediate, 

the way that it hit me — 
something about the tone being 
off,” Proegler later said in an 
interview. “As I was reading it, it 
didn’t seem like something that 
had really taken into account 
the problems of students who 
are 
experiencing 
absolute 

issues with accessibility and 
affordability. It didn’t read like 
something that would actually 
be working towards improving 
accessibility for students who 
need it, and for CSG to push it 
that way was upsetting.”

Proegler brought up the 

specific points mentioned in 
the article, some of which 
she felt were out of touch and 
potentially dangerous to the 
students who would benefit 
most from this guide.

“It comes up twice in those 

first 50 points that students 
should get rid of cleaning or 
laundry service subscriptions 
in order to save money,” she 
said. “That, to me, doesn’t 
sound 
like 
they’re 
really 

addressing students who they 
intended to be targeting with 
that. The whole guide seemed 
to put CSG at a disadvantage in 
communicating what they were 
trying to do. There’s no way 
you can explain to somebody 
what a balance transfer is in 
two sentences. And to attempt 
to do so, is I think, grossly 
negligent.”

In a comment on Proegler’s 

Facebook 
post, 
CSG 
Vice 

President Nadine Jawad wrote 

she 
thought 
the 
numerous 

comments critiquing the guide 
misrepresented her years spent 
working with Ann Arbor City 
Council members, students and 
programs, such as the Ginsberg 
Center, in order to present 
options for students to live in 
Ann Arbor on a budget.

“As the director of this 

guide, 
and 
as 
a 
first-gen 

student who struggles with 
finances and costs here, this is 
a misrepresentative portrayal 
of two years of compiling 
research,” Jawad wrote. “My 
advocacy on affordable housing 
started with a journey through 
15+ meetings with Ann Arbor 
commissioners 
and 
council 

members as well as several 
meetings with U-M Housing. 
CSG actually helped institute a 
student advisory board to City 
Council last winter as a result 
of some of this research. This 
guide is a compilation of notes, 
but doesn’t erase the fear of 
prices in an ever-increasingly 
expensive city that doesn’t feel 
like someone like me can fit in or 
afford. SES and inaccessibility 
to low-income students isn’t a 
joke and is worthy of more than 
a string of FB comments. This 
is a first proactive step I, and 
many others, took to starting to 
change something. I appreciate 
the feedback and this is a 
revolving document.”

A 
CSG 
senior 
cabinet 

member, who asked to remain 
anonymous, 
was 
concerned 

most of the suggestions — 
which included points such as 
buying items in bulk or selling 
a vehicle — were not addressing 
the real issues that students 
face 
with 
affordability 
on 

campus.

“I 
had 
generally 
known 

(the guide) was coming; it 
was something that had been 
in the works for a while, but 
most people hadn’t really seen 
the content of it,” he said. “I 
thought it was a good idea at 
first, trying to make campus 
more affordable is something 
I’m very passionate about, but 
I think this is a tonality issue. 
Reading through the pages, the 
suggestions seemed so glib and 
out of touch. I think the set of 
college students with a maid 
is incredibly small already and 
is not low-income students. 
It came across less as though 
it was intended to be aimed 
towards low-income students 
and more as a guide for fairly 
wealthy students.”

He also pointed out the 

guide was lengthy and filled 
with redundant material.

“It’s 80 pages long,” he said. 

“A lot of this is just hugely 
extraneous material that’s not 
relevant and is just taking up 
space. We’re all busy students — 
low-income students more than 
most of us. I don’t have time to 
read an 84-page pamphlet in 
detail. I’m doubtful that kids 
who are working two plus jobs 
to put themselves through 
college are able to do that.”

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel said she would 
have 
appreciated 
a 
more 

detailed focus on employment 
opportunities 
and 
ways 
to 

balance 
work 
and 
study 

schedules.

“I was so surprised to find 

that 
there 
was 
almost 
no 

mention 
of 
employment 
in 

the guide — after all, having a 

Michigan 
Medicine 

physician Mark Hoeltzel is 
under investigation by a state 
licensing 
board 
for 
sexual 

misconduct, according to a 
statement 
from 
Michigan 

Medicine 
CEO 
Marschall 

Runge, 
executive 
vice 

president of Medical Affairs 
for the University of Michigan.

Michigan 
Medicine 
was 

notified of the investigation 
in 
early 
December 
and 

immediately removed Hoeltzel, 
a 
pediatric 
rheumatologist, 

from patient care duties. He 
has not been allowed to return 
to work, and his employment 
with Michigan Medicine has 
since been terminated.

Runge 
wrote 
Michigan 

Medicine reported Hoeltzel to 
law enforcement officials right 
away, and is cooperating with 
the investigation, which is 
already underway. An outside 
professional has been hired to 
review the matter.

“These are very disturbing 

and serious allegations, and 
we have reached out to our 
patients to inform them of 
the situation, offer resources 
and provide them with a way 
to report any concerns,” the 
statement reads.

The 
Michigan 
Medicine 

community was notified of 
the situation this morning 
in an email sent by Michelle 
Daniel, 
assistant 
professor 

of Emergency Medicine. She 

urged medical students to do 
everything possible to attend 
the meeting, as they would be 
divulging information about a 
former faculty member.

“We will be holding an 

urgent meeting today from 
12:30-12:45 in West Lecture 
Hall,” Daniel wrote in the 
email. “We have important 
information to share about a 
former faculty member. We 
understand that some of you 
are in your Step Study period, 
and others are at clinical sites 
away from the main campus. 
If you are on campus, please 
make every effort to attend. 
Your faculty should release you 
for this time period.”

A letter was sent to all of 

Hoeltzel’s patients by Michigan 
Medicine, explaining Hoeltzel 
was under investigation for 
sexual misconduct and their 
child would be transferred to a 
different doctor.

“Your 
child 
is 
our 
top 

priority,” 
the 
letter 
states. 

“We 
understand 
that 
this 

information will be disturbing 
and a cause for concern.”

According to ClickOnDetroit, 

Hoeltzel was first accused 
of misconduct in 2004. He 
exchanged 
“flirtatious” 

messages with an 11-year-old 
girl he had examined at a U-M 
arthritis camp.

The hospital sent Hoeltzel 

to a “boundaries course” as a 
result.

No 
additional 
complaints 

were filed against Hoeltzel 
until December, when the state 
licensing board notified the 
hospital of the investigation.

In 
response 
to 
the 
bias 

incidents that have taken place 
on the University of Michigan 
campus, the Dean of Students 
office is launching the Response, 
Education 
and 
Awareness 

Community Taskforce (REACT) 
with Respect initiative. The task 
force will work along the Expect 
Respect campaign, as well as 
the Bias Response Team, to 
create a more inclusive campus 
environment through workshops, 
peer support services and more. 
Students who sign up for the 
initiative can be trained in one of 
two areas: preventative planning 
or bias incident training, and 
will learn how to handle issues 
involving identity, bias, and social 
and restorative justice ideas.

Bias 
incidents 
have 
been 

steadily increasing on campus in 
the last two years. A new response 
log published last fall reported 80 
incidents last semester alone. 

Julio 
Cardona, 
interim 

Assistant 
Dean 
of 
Students, 

currently 
manages 
the 
Bias 

Incident Prevention and Response 
team and the Expect Respect 
Campaign. 
Cardona 
further 

explained the development of 

REACT with Respect initiative, 
pointing out it was created at the 
request of members from the 
student body.

“It is a pilot program that was 

created in response to students 
last year expressing the desire 
to be more actively involved in 
preventing 
bias 
incidents 
on 

campus, and also finding ways 
that they can support the work of 
the Expect Respect campaign,” 
Cardona said. “This year we 
decided to pilot the program with 
a few students just to see how 
then in the future we can continue 
expanding it out.”

Cardona also discussed the 

goals of the initiative: offering 
students who have faced bias 
situations support and resources 
to 
report 
the 
incident, 
and 

implementing 
preventative 

measures in collaboration with the 
Expect Respect campaign.

“This is really almost like 

a 
student 
organization 
that 

is supporting and acting as 
an advising group,” he said. 
“(However it is) also providing 
peer support to students that may 
need to file a bias incident report 
with Student Life, but don’t know 
how to, or may feel that there is 
a sense of retaliation if they do 
… Also it’s helping to do more 
preventative events, so tabling, 

flyering, chalking the Diag to 
tell people about what we do, but 
then also programming around 
the Expect Respect campaign 
through doing workshops, and 
meeting with other students orgs 
to discuss all of our initiatives.”

REACT with Respect and the 

Expect Respect campaign are both 
parts of the Diversity, Equality 
and Inclusion Plan implemented 
by the University in 2016. Cardona 
highlighted the ways that REACT 
with Respect paralleled different 
aspects of the DEI both in regards 
to the campus-wide plan and the 
Student Life plan.

“This pilot program aligns 

directly to Strategy Two of the 
U-M campus-wide strategic plan, 
and that strategy is to, ‘Recruit, 
maintain and support a diverse 
community,’” Cardona said. “Then 
also specifically to Student Life’s 
DEI strategic plan of increasing 
the 
capacity 
of 
student 
life 

programs devoted to supporting 
student experiencing bias and 
improving campus climate.”

Cardona ended by explaining 

the 
importance 
of 
ensuring 

students’ voices are heard so the 
University can take action in areas 
that actually need it, not just ones 
presumed by the administration.

“We really want the students’ 

voice and their ideas represented 

in all of our work,” Cardona said. 
“If we need to update the Expect 
Respect webpage we’ll ensure 
that students thoughts and ideas 
are incorporated in it, so that way 
we address the current needs 
of students. Especially if we’re 
going to share resources that are 
about reporting a bias incident, we 
want to make sure that the type 
of resources we provide students 
are currently aligned to what they 
need, and not what we assume 
they need.”

The program is still in its 

beginning phase, and searching 
for student participants. Megan 
Zabik is an LSA sophomore 
considering joining REACT with 
Respect.

“It sounds really interesting to 

me because I think the University 
needs more initiative like that. 
I hope that it can help create a 
more understanding culture at the 
University of Michigan,” Zabik 
said. “The national culture isn’t 
very inclusive and I feel like it’s 
reflected at this University for 
sure, and it needs to change. The 
administration should have more 
initiatives like this, and I hope to 
support it with my involvement.”

A

ccording 
to 
the 

National 
Center 
for 

Complementary 
and 

Integrative Health, 18 million 
U.S. adults meditate. How do they 
find the time?

I tried to take up meditation 

during the second semester of 
my freshman year. I had just 
gone through a particularly nasty 
breakup, 
my 
Undergraduate 

Research Opportunity Program 
project was not what I had 
anticipated, and my coursework 
was both overwhelming and 
unengaging. I needed an out, a 
way to regain the focus and drive 
I had lost. So I began going to 
mindfulness sessions offered in 
the basement of the University of 
Michigan’s Angell Hall.

That did not last very long. 

Meditation is not an instant peace 
of mind. It is also hard, especially 
when your mind is racing with 
a 
thousand 
things 
(which, 

ironically, is what causes you to 
attempt meditation). Meditation 
can 
also 
be 
really 
boring, 

especially if you have grown used 
to always having something to do 
or think about.

I 
first 
became 
interested 

in meditation when I read 
Hermann Hesse’s “Siddhartha” 
in high school. Was I expecting a 
cosmic experience my first time 
meditating? No, but I did expect 
to feel something.

The biggest factor that cut 

my meditation adventure short 
was time. Fitting mindfulness 
sessions into my busy schedule 
was always a challenge. I could 
have tried to meditate solo; 
however, I felt like I needed to 
do it with other people to hold 
myself accountable. Perhaps if 
I had felt more “at peace” after 
meditation I would have made 
the effort to continue. Perhaps if 
I had made the effort to continue 
I would have started to feel more 
“at peace.” The chicken or the 
egg. I guess I will never know.

The 
next 
time 
I 
tried 

mindfulness was in Behavioral 
and Social Foundations for the 
Health Professions, when one 
day our professor walked us 

through some forms of meditation 
in his lecture on presence. One 
of them, called loving-kindness 
meditation actually did have an 
impact on me. The meditation’s 
ethos is to cultivate goodwill and 
kindness by mentally sending it to 
various people in your life. I would 
recommend it to anyone wanting 
to reconnect with their emotions 
(the stress of college can make you 
numb), but I warn you: it is intense. 
I cried — no, weeped — in class 
during the meditation. It felt great 
afterward, like I was as light as a 
feather, but it was also exhausting. 
I have yet to try loving-kindness 
again only because it requires 
someone to facilitate.

I still am looking for a way to be 

present and mindful because I feel 
like I am misaligned with time. I 
dwell on the past while worrying 
about the future, all while largely 
ignoring the present.

The past is immutable and 

unchangeable. Mistakes I have 
made, often due to nothing 
more than not thinking before 
I speak, are permanent scabs 
that fester until I eventually 
forget about them. Even in 
the shadowy realm of my 
mind where I store all the bad 
memories — what psychiatrist 
Carl 
Jung 
would 
call 
the 

personal unconscious — the 
memory of these mistakes are 
just waiting to erupt back into 
thought. Letting go, moving on: 
These have never been things I 
have been good at.

Then there is the future: 

Something 
I 
both 
plan 

meticulously for and at the 

same time know nothing about. 
In 
my 
favorite 
childhood 

book series, “Percy Jackson 
and 
the 
Olympians,” 
each 

hero had a fatal flaw. Mine 
would be decision anxiety. 
For every choice that I make, 
I worry intensely about the 
consequences 
and 
whether 

I have made the “right call.” 
Waiting to see if I made a 
good decision or not can be 
hell. I also feel like my time at 
the University is flying by too 
quickly, and there is so much I 
want to do and experience.

The solution to my problems 

with both the past and the 
future would be to focus more 
on the present. Then I would 
consider my words and actions 
more deeply and enjoy what time 
I have left as an undergraduate. 
Realizing 
the 
benefits 
of 

presence and mindfulness is 
one thing, finding the right way 
to put it in action is another.

I believe that many students 

are in the same position I find 
myself in; we need mindfulness 
but have not found the right 
path towards it. Meditation is 
one path, but it cannot be the 
only one.

One path I am trying now is 

maintaining a planner. Now, 
this may seem like it should 
be second nature to most 
students 
at 
the 
University, 

but I have always struggled in 
maintaining one. Perhaps this 
is because the planner hides 
in my backpack or maybe it is 
because I move through things 
so mindlessly that I do not 
stop to think to plan ahead. 
For each student, the path to 
mindfulness will look different.

So, 
to 
all 
my 
fellow 

Wolverines that have struggled 
with meditation and in finding 
a way towards mindfulness: I 
empathize with you. It is hard, 
but the end result—a way to 
stop dwelling on the past and 
worrying about the future—is 
worth it.

Presence, part and future

Meditation is not 
an instant peace 

of mind. 

Over the past few weeks, 

all eyes have been on Judge 
Rosemarie Aquilina’s courtroom 
as more than 160 survivors of 
sexual abuse by disgraced Dr. 
Larry Nassar have recounted 
their stories at the Ingham 
County 
Circuit 
Court. 
Last 

Wednesday, Dr. Nassar’s was 
sentenced to 40-175 years in 
prison. He has been accused of 
countless criminal sexual acts 
in his roles as a team doctor 
and athletic trainer for the USA 
Gymnastics team spanning over 
the last three decades as well as 
faces charges in Eaton County.

These heroic women have 

showcased immense bravery in 
the face of great trauma. However, 
in spite of the heroism playing 
out in open court, accountability 
and justice seem to be missing. 
Failures on all levels must have 
occurred in order for Dr. Nassar 
to abuse patients for decades. But 
the pure lack of compassion and 
accountability that led to this 
serial abuse was evident on many 
levels in the last few weeks — first 
through the absence of Lou Anna 
Simon, president of Michigan 
State University, on the first day 
of victims’ impact statements. 
Yet, the failures by Simon go 
beyond her lack of attendance in 
court. According to the Detroit 
News, Simon and up to 14 others 
at MSU knew of Nassar’s abuse 
at least as early as 2014. Even 
more alarming than this was the 
under-oath revelation that MSU 
still billed survivors of Nassar’s 
assaults. Since the testimony, a 
Univeristy spokesman has said 
patients with outsanding bills 
will no longer be charged. 

We find the failure to protect 

these 
victims 
disturbing 

and unacceptable, and while 
President Simon announced her 
resignation Wednesday night, 
it is only the beginning of the 
institutional 
accountability 

that needs to be taken. Yet, in 
commenting on her decision 
to resign Simon stated, “As 
tragedies are politicized, blame is 
inevitable. As president, it is only 
natural that I am the focus of this 
anger.” While her resignation is 
a sign of needed change at MSU, 
her rhetoric again avoids taking 
true responsibility for the lack of 
institutional oversight.

Simon hid behind the MSU 

Board of Trustees, who also 
seem driven to ignore the pain 
caused by Nassar’s abuse, with 
Trustee Joel Ferguson noting to 
a local radio show, “There’s so 
many more things going on at the 
university than just this Nassar 
thing.” This rhetoric devalues 
the trauma countless survivors 
endured, trauma which occurred 
under the watch of people who 
knew, yet did nothing.

This motivation to preserve 

reputation shone through when 
MSU 
Basketball 
coach 
Tom 

Izzo was asked for comment 
on the Nassar case. He offered 
this in reference to President 
Simon: “That’s a woman who has 
dedicated over 40 years — and 
I’ve been here 33 with her, and 
I think I know what she stands 
for,” and when asked specifically 
about the call for a change in 
leadership, he answered with 
“you have to understand there 
is nothing I can say that is going 
to be right right now, and there 
is nothing that’s going to make 
anybody right. I’ll just stick by 
what I said.” Our own University 
President Mark Schlissel also 
declined to take a stance on the 
role that MSU played in the 
abuse, saying “I just can’t add to 
the debate because I don’t have 
any special information.” 

Izzo’s response is indicative 

of a greater problem. Defending 
Simon may be the easier decision, 
especially given her long tenure 
at Michigan State. However, 
institutional accountability must 
come before their relationships 
with Simon and the need to 
maintain a reputation. If we allow 
complicity from those in power, 
there will not be any impactful 
change, and systematic problems 

and ignorance will perpetuate.

This time in society is important; 

#MeToo has called great attention 
to sexual abusers in high places. 
However, abusers are not the only 
problem. The institutions that 
enable them deserve blame as well. 
This is not only a problem with MSU 
or USA Gymnastics. It is a societal ill 
and could have impacted on our own 
campus, or any other one. This case 
draws many similarities to what 
occurred at Penn State University in 
2011. Assistant football coach Jerry 
Sandusky was sexually abusing 
young boys for decades after head 
coach Joe Paterno was notified. 
This pattern is unacceptable. Those 
in positions of power at universities 
must prioritize the safety of their 
students, just as those in power in 
other institutions must prioritize 
the safety of their employees, 
members or citizens.

While 
this 
criminal 
case 

surrounding Dr. Nassar has now 
been closed in Ingham County, 
the pain and trauma he caused 
will remain for decades to come. 
While it’s easy to punish Nassar 
through his 60-year and 40 to 
175-year prison sentences, it’s a 
lot harder to face the fact that 
those who were complicit in his 
reign of assaults are also guilty. 
The list of people who enabled Dr. 
Nassar includes MSU President 
Lou Anna Simon, but extends far 
beyond just her. Michigan State 
University, 
USA 
Gymnastics, 

the 
United 
States 
Olympic 

Committee and more will share 
the blame in civil court, but the 
true evil that allowed for Dr. 
Nassar to inflict so much harm 
is in the culture of denial and 
doubt that falls on sexual assault 
and harassment on all levels 
within institutions. It is the need 
to maintain a good reputation 
and avoid scandal that enables 
abusers like Nassar to commit 
these acts for years. Immediate 
action once the first allegations 
are made is not only needed, 
but expected from universities, 
institutions 
and 
individuals. 

The time is up for this culture 
of secrecy, coverups and sexual 
assault, and in order for the 
next Larry Nassar to be stopped 
before he can hurt others, we all 
have to hold ourselves and our 
institutions accountable.

In solidarity with the survivors of Larry Nassar

FROM THE DAILY

O

ver the past week, more than 160 brave women and girls stood in a 
courtroom in Lansing and valiantly faced their abuser, Larry Nassar, 
a former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor. The 

court and the country listened closely as the survivors told their victim impact 
statements, each more powerful than the last, spelling out a disturbing pattern 
of sexual abuse that spanned three decades. As the last day of the trial came to 
a close Wednesday, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to serve 40 
to 175 years in state prison after he carries out his 60-year federal sentence for 
child pornography. After 20 long years, Larry Nassar’s time is finally up.

 
We, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board, as the student voice of the 

University of Michigan, stand in solidarity with the survivors of the horrific 
abuse by Larry Nassar and admire their fierce strength and bravery. We 
condemn the institutions that let them down. Michigan State University, USA 
Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee all had a duty to protect 
these young women, but their inaction allowed Nassar’s abuse to continue 
far longer than it had to. We must hold these institutions — and all those who 
enable abuse — accountable. By so bravely sharing their stories, the survivors 
brought abusers to justice and have set a precedent that there is no tolerance for 
sexual assault.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

 
 
 
 
 
The Michigan Daily Editorial Board

It is the need to 
maintain a good 
reputation and 

avoid scandal that 
enables abusers 
like Nassar to 

commit these acts 

for years.

O

n 
Jan. 
13, 
babe.net 

published 
an 
article 

revealing an experience 

that a young woman (referred to 
in the piece and throughout this 
article as Grace) had on a date 
with comedian Aziz Ansari in 
September. The story describes 
him making multiple aggressive 
attempts to have sex with her, 
despite her many verbal and 
non-verbal cues that she was 
not into it. This accusation has 
been more divisive than any 
others that have come out of the 
#MeToo movement. Previously, 
this movement to expose sexual 
abusers has received enthusiastic 
support from feminists and decent 
people everywhere. The Ansari 
allegations have caused a sharp 
divide among many of those same 
people. Some claim this story does 
not describe an assault and is thus 
undermining #MeToo as a whole, 
while others argue that though 
it may not be rape or workplace 
sexual harassment, the movement 
has room for all stories involving 
sexual abuse or coercion. I 
adamantly agree with the latter.

The allegations made against 

Ansari clearly describe him as 
continuously pressuring Grace 
into sexual acts after she clearly 
expressed she would rather not 
engage in them on that night. 
That is a clear example of sexual 
coercion. I’ve been disturbed at 
the number of people who have 
doubted the malice of Ansari’s 
actions; I’ve been even more 
disturbed at how many have 
suggested that this could decrease 
the legitimacy of other stories or 
#MeToo as a whole.

I expect that kind of opinion 

from people like conservative 
commentator Ben Shapiro, who 
immediately capitalized on the 
chance to ask “Is #MeToo Falling 
Apart?” but it wasn’t only open 
misogynists who were acting as 
though the movement was being 
threatened. Journalists Caitlin 
Flanagan , Ashleigh Banfield and 
Bari Weiss all had pretty strong 
attacks for Ansari’s accuser and 
the journalist who reported the 
story. Flanagan had previously 
written 
a 
piece 
that 
hailed 

#MeToo, calling it a “long-overdue 
revolution.” These are women that 
I’d often think were on our side; 

ready to smash the patriarchy.

Maybe they are, in their 

minds. But that isn’t enough. 
After meditating on this for a 
week or so, it seems that the 
writers who are attacking Grace 
and the author of the piece, Katie 
Way, for derailing the movement 
were only ever fighting for 
themselves. It is just another 
example of exclusive feminism, 
and I am quite exasperated with 
it.

Grace’s story represents the 

experiences of so many young 
women who do not have voices as 
prominent as those who brought 
down 
Harvey 
Weinstein. 

Though her story was still 
aimed at a famous man, it made 
#MeToo relatable and relevant 
to many college-age women. It 
confirmed that those creepy, 
scary nights that made us cry — 
but never felt “bad enough” to 
call assault — are not OK and will 
not be tolerated. But the older, 
more powerful women said sit 
down and shut up because this is 
their movement.

That sentiment was clearly 

displayed by Ashleigh Banfield. 
On 
Jan. 
15 
she 
said 
this 

during her segment on HLN: 
“You have chiseled away at a 
movement that I, along with all 
of my sisters in the workplace, 
have been dreaming of for 
decades, a movement that has 
finally changed an oversexed 
professional environment that 
I, too, have struggled through 
at times over the last 30 years.” 
I suppose that means Grace isn’t 
a sister, but a whiny young girl 
who went on a “bad date” and 
wants to ruin a man’s career for 
it. Caitlin Flanagan expanded 
this narrative by calling the piece 
“revenge porn” by a girl who 
“hoped to maybe even become 
the famous man’s girlfriend.”

Well, 
if 
they 
disapprove 

of Grace’s inclusion in this 
movement, they can leave it. 
They can keep fighting for justice 
in cases that fit their narrow 
definition of abuse. But #MeToo 
is much larger than that. It is 
a movement intended to draw 
attention to the magnitude of 
the problem of sexual abuse, 
something that cannot and will 
not be done if survivors are 

intimidated and silenced by 
those controlling the messaging. 
The rhetoric of these journalists, 
and others, is victim blaming, 
irresponsible, anti-feminist and 
exclusionary.

I do not doubt that the 

generations of women before 
us have paved the way by 
withstanding years of abuse and 
harassment, and I understand 
that the Ansari allegations may 
seem far removed from the 
traditional conceptions of sexual 
abuse. 
As 
Flanagan 
herself 

wrote, “intimate accounts of 
commonplace 
sexual 
events 

of the young seem like science 
fiction.” The culture and norms 
are 
changing. 
Just 
because 

behavior has been historically 
deemed as commonplace or 
acceptable, does not mean that 
we must continue to allow it, or 
that it is not coercive or abusive 
in nature.

Twenty-three 
perent 
of 

female undergraduate students 
experience some form of sexual 
assault in college, according to 
Rape, Abuse & Incest National 
Network. This is the terrifying 
and traumatic reality of modern-
day college women. We do not 
need anyone to explain the 
reality of sexual assault to us, 
we understand. We understand 
affirmative consent and expect 
it. We understand that any 
attempt at changing our minds 
after we express we are not 
OK with the sexual advances 
is coercive. We understand our 
trauma and our fear, and we want 
to fight back. We understand the 
importance of intersectionality 
in 
this 
conversation; 
varied 

identities inevitably result in 
varied experiences with sexual 
abuse. Do not tell us to sit back 
and carry out this movement 
on anyone’s terms but our own. 
Our understanding is correct, 
valid, and will be the guiding 
message of a movement to 
expose and eradicate all forms of 
sexual assault, harassment and 
coercion and the culture that 
allows them. Please join us, and 
follow our lead.

#MeToo is our movement

Simon is only the beginning


The best sci-fi, or rather, the 
most effective sci-fi, walks the 
line 
between 
the 
fantastical 
and real. It shows that the most 
horrifying parts of our collective 
future aren’t necessarily aliens or 
other supernatural phenomena, 
but rather humanity itself and its 
relationship with its creations. 
The new Amazon series “Philip 
K. Dick’s Electric Dreams” is a 
flawed but intriguing addition 
to the canon of works such as 
“Black Mirror” that explore our 
relationship with technology and 
warn of the consequences.
“Electric Dreams” inevitably 
lends itself to several comparisons 
with 
the 
Netflix 
(previously 
Channel 4) hit “Black Mirror.” 
Similar to the latter, it features a set 
of standalone episodes, adaptions 
of works by the American writer 
Philip K. Dick (known for “The 
Man in the High Castle” and 
“Blade 
Runner”). 
Nonetheless, 
it rarely captures its British 
counterpart’s sheer, bleak dread 

and often feels rather predictable. 
Some episodes, such as “Real 
Life,” do skillfully adapt Dick’s 
Cold War tales and examine the 
possible effects of virtual reality 
technology. However, most of the 
episodes — while tackling nuanced 
issues — miss the mark in terms of 
having the effect that Dick’s stories 
often have on audiences.
Despite its flaws, “Electric 
Dreams” begs the discussion 
once again about the different 

approaches similar works take 
on the future and how we should 
learn from them. “Black Mirror” 
tackles its subjects, ranging from 
euthanasia to augmented reality, 
in a twisted, satirical (dare one 
say British) fashion. For the most 
part, “Black Mirror” episodes feel 
very real and their devastating 
effects arise from the small 
tweaks that the writers make to 
the world. Episodes of “Electric 

Dreams” on the other hand have 
a sense of paranoia due to the 
fact that a lot of Dick’s works that 
they are based on were written 
in the repressive back-drop of the 
Cold War, the first time in history 
where humanity came face to face 
with its own ability to wipe itself 
out. It shares several similarities 
with Radiohead’s 1997 classic 
OK Computer, an album which, 
through songs such as “Paranoid 
Android” and “No Surprises,” 
creates a simultaneously frenetic 
and deflated reaction to modern 
life.
Ever 
since 
“The 
Twilight 
Zone” aired in the 1960s, works 
in all formats of entertainment 
have dealt with the relationship 
between humanity and technology. 
Some may dismiss them as fear-
mongering and unrealistic, while 
others may start to resent the 
march of technological progress. 
What these shows should remind 
us is the fact that it is our duty to 
take a step back and reflect on 
ourselves. After all, it is not the 
technology that is inherently 
awful, but rather human nature 
itself that can make it have awful 
effects.

There’s 
verve, 
and 
then 
there’s nerve. Directors can 
spend years trying to sift a 
unique idea into a unique film, 
only to have it bastardized 
or 
otherwise 
enfolded 
into 
generic studio dribble. That’s 
the gift of a place like Sundance, 
seemingly the antithesis of the 
stuffy studio system: Here, 
you’re able to find voices with 
wild visions who, admittedly by 
some miracle, have found the 
money to construct a truly new 
story. 
From the opening moments 
of “Sorry to Bother You,” you 
know you’re in the hands of a 
visionary. Director Boots Riley, 
making his debut amid a music 
career with The Coup, has 
crafted a somewhat psychedelic, 
Charlie Kaufman-esque balls-
to-the-wall social satire that 
feels so unique, so new, so 
gripping 
and 
unpredictable. 
In 
Oakland, 
Cassius 
Green 
(Lakeith Stanfield, “Get Out”) 
finagles his way into a job at a 
telemarketing firm, finding a 
hierarchy that privileges white 
culture and abuses lower-rung 
workers. What ensues is a deft 

(and daft) racial satire that 
attacks its targets with violence 
and precision like an axe. 
The score by Merrill Garbus, 
who records as tUnE-yArDs is 
deliriously perfect, amplifying 
the 
bizarre 
world 
creation 
and logic that spools out from 
Riley’s delicious vision.
It would be too easy to 
dismiss, or even to categorize, 
“Sorry to Bother You” as “Get 
Out”-esque (though I will admit 
to using the descriptor in trying 
to hastily describe this film). 
While “Get Out” targets well-
meaning white liberals, “Sorry 
to Bother You” takes on a larger 
topic: the corporate America 
that abuses history to serve its 
own purposes. Armie Hammer 
(“Call Me By Your Name”), who 
plays a sort of Silicon Valley 
magnate who graces magazine 
covers referring to him as the 
next genius, delivers in every 
scene as a snake-like villain, 
tantalizing in his mannerisms 
yet wickedly evil underneath.

If you were anybody in New 
York in 1977, you knew about 
Studio 54. The famous — or 
perhaps 
infamous 
— 
disco 
club lasted for less than three 
years in Times Square, but its 
influence on American culture 

has lasted far longer. Two 
movies in 1998 were made about 
the club, “54” and, to an extent, 
“The Last Days of Disco,” 
as well as the recent Netflix 
show “The Get Down,” which 
partially takes place in a Studio 
54-like club. It’s safe to say that 
Studio 54 was the epicenter of 
disco, a music trend focused on 
sex, drugs and dancing.
“Studio 
54,” 
a 
new 
documentary 
from 
director 
Matt Tyrnauer (“Citizen Jane: 
Battle for the City”), is an 
unfortunately 
conventional 
documentary that nevertheless 
captures the highs and (much 
deeper) lows of the club’s 
tragically short run. Cultivated 
from 
archival 
footage 
and 
interviews 
with 
various 
denizens, worker antagonists 
and 
semi 
co-founder 
Ian 
Schrager, “Studio 54” offers 
a perfectly satisfying, but far 
from mind-blowing, account of 
the club.
Schrager, 
it’s 
clear 
from 
the beginning, was never the 
talkative one. Those duties he 
left to co-founder and best friend 
Steve Rubell, a flamboyantly 
popular persona who appeared 
on talk shows and mingled with 
guests while Schrager stayed in 
the background. Rubell passed

It’s the last week of Jan., 
and as I walk around campus, 
I can almost feel stress levels 
increasing 
among 
students. 
Midterms are approaching and 
spring break is still a month 
away. During times like this in 
the semester, I internalize my 
stress when I’m overwhelmed 
with 
assignments 
and 
interviews. I just let it build and 
build, and, sometimes during 
the week, I might break down. 
But then, I keep bottling up 
my stress again, not showing it 
externally but feeling all of its 
effects internally.
Sometimes, we all need a 
reminder to just slow the hell 
down, stop pushing away our 
problems under the pretense of 
being busy and work through 
them instead. I find that one 
of the best ways to do this is 
by talking to someone about 
what’s on my mind. When I 
entered “Value the Voice” at 
the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art on Jan. 23, I 
had a million things racing 
through my head. But when I 
left, I felt more at peace than I 
ever have on this campus.
“Value the Voice” is an open-
mic storytelling series hosted 
by the Comprehensive Studies 
Program and the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies at the University. Their 
goal is to emphasize the power 
that one’s words have. Imagine 
The Moth Radio Hour, but in 
real life. In this installment, the 
storytellers were all students 
or alumni of the University. 

The theme, which was quite 
fitting for a new semester, was 
“Nobody Told Me” — stories of 
the reality of college life.
There’s 
something 
extremely 
vulnerable, 
yet 
immensely 
beautiful, 
about 
sharing your struggles. You 
feel like a portion of the pain 
is being lifted off your chest, 
even though the problem may 
still remain. Looking at the 
storytellers, I could see all 
of these complex emotions 
running through their minds. 
Some told stories of racial 
discrimination 
they 
have 
faced, others told of family 
struggles. Some laughed, some 
cried and some did both. But 
in each speaker, I saw their 
delight in sharing their burden 
with others.
Zanib Sareini, an alumni 
of the CSP and currently 
a graduate student at the 
University’s School of Social 
Work, shared her experience 
of being an Arab-American in a 
post-Sept. 11 America.
“There 
was 
a 
different 
pressure 
post-9/11,” 
Sareini 
said. She recalls being told by 
her parents to “hold the door 
open a little longer, smile, don’t 
let them see you angry, don’t 
be reactive, always be nice,” 
and not understanding why it 
had to be so. As people treated 
her 
differently, 
she 
slowly 
secluded herself from others in 
an effort to stay out of trouble. 
Being a part of the CSP support 
system 
at 
the 
University, 
however, helped her through 
her anxiety. As she told this 
part of her story, CSP students 
in the front rows whooped and 
cheered. Sareini smiled back. 

While she couldn’t stop the 
discrimination, she knew who 
to come to for help.
Eddie Williams, a student of 
the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, told of how his 
relationship with his family 
changed 
upon 
coming 
to 
college. He distanced himself 
from them, found himself too 
busy with homework and later 
discovered that his grandfather 
had passed away during finals.
“Everybody in my family 
got a chance to have one last 
conversation except for me,” 
said Williams.
My heart lurched when he 
said this. Whenever someone 
else 
tells 
me 
something 
intimate like this, I imagine 
what it would be like to be 
in their shoes. And when 
Williams said those words, I 
really felt it.
As the night progressed, 
I watched storytellers pour 
their hearts out. Somehow, 
I felt like I was right up 
there with them. Through 
listening, they became a small 
part of my life. To all those 
who are conflicted, afraid or 
overwhelmed — find someone 
to tell your story to. It’s OK 
to be raw and vulnerable. It’s 
the first step towards comfort 
and, maybe, a sense of closure. 
If the storytellers at “Value 
the Voice” didn’t realize the 
impact their words could have 
on others, I’m sure they do 
now.
“Value the Voice” is part of 
an ongoing series. The next 
storytellers’s 
lounge 
is 
on 
Mar. 27 at the UMMA. Stories 
will discuss the theme of 
“Triumph.”

away during the AIDS epidemic 
(he was closeted to his family), 
so Schrager is left with the 
responsibility of sharing their 
story. The club experienced a 
meteoric rise in 1977 — scored 
to a pumping disco soundtrack 
in the film — only to experience 
trouble with the IRS after they 
discover a major skimming 
scheme and drug possession. 
Schrager and Rubell, defended 
by McCarthyist lawyer Roy 
Cohn, enter prison.
It’s not hard to find something 
to love in the documentary, 
from its cameos both in the 
past (Liza Minnelli and Andy 
Warhol, perhaps the two most 
famous regulars of the club, 
appear regularly) and present 
(an interview with Nile Rodgers 
of the band Chic is illuminating) 
to its true crime story, one of 
conflicting narratives between 
the 
case 
prosecutor 
and 
Schrager and associates. But one 
could only wish that for a club 
that was so innovative, from its 
Broadway lighting designs to 
its inclusivity as a gay haven in 
an otherwise unfriendly New 
York, a documentary on the 
subject would live up to that 
standard as well.
***
A quick note to producers: 

If someone comes to you and 
says they have a great idea 
for a film, and it begins with, 
“Here’s 
where 
Shakespeare 
got it wrong,” chances are 
you’re in for a bad idea. A 
perfect 
example: 
“Ophelia,” 
a retelling of “Hamlet” from 
Ophelia’s point of view. For 
those like me who are generally 
unfamiliar with the Bard’s tale 
of Danish revenge, “Hamlet” 
follows a Danish prince who 
tries to murder his uncle who 
he suspects killed his father. 
Ophelia, 
Hamlet’s 
romantic 
interest 
and 
the 
daughter 
of 
the 
king’s 
advisor, 
has 
historically been reviled but 
feminist literature critics have 
sought to revise her reputation. 
Unfortunately, “Ophelia” might 
be a step back.
It should be said that the film, 
directed by Claire McCarthy 
(“Little Hands”), is deceptively 
gorgeous, so much so that it can 
distract from the film’s larger 
(much larger) flaws. Nearly 
every shot, rich in color and 
draped in period dress and sets, 
feels both real and imagined, 
like the weaved tapestries that 
hang 
throughout 
Elsinore. 
The score, though far less 
intoxicating, is still somewhat 
lush but can be overwhelming at 

times, often adding an artificial 
layer of capital-I Importance 
to the movie that is almost 
always erased by the film’s utter 
ludicrousness.
“Ophelia,” 
which 
could 
have 
been 
a 
well-deserved 
acting 
showcase 
for 
Daisy 
Ridley (“Star Wars: The Last 
Jedi”), who plays the titular 
role, collapses under its own 
premise 
and 
is 
otherwise 
tarnished by rather mediocre 
performances by Naomi Watts 
(“The Glass Castle”) and Clive 
Owen (“Valerian and the City 
of a Thousand Planets”). Ridley 
can do more with her eyes than 
most people can do with their 
entire bodies, but even she is 
restrained by a wildly abhorrent 
script that verges on camp. A 
third act, a complete invention 
that seems both conspiratorial 
and overly melodramatic is 
a complete disaster, and the 
rest of the film is not much 
better. This is a film that starts 
with a voiceover narration by 
Ridley that is something along 
the lines of, “This is my story 
… ,” a signal of subpar quality. 
Reworking classic texts into 
feminist works is a noble, even 
vital, goal, but “Ophelia” should 
serve as a cautionary tale, not 
an inspiration.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Friday, January 26, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

You 
may 
have 
heard 
of 
blackbear. 
The 
image-
conscious 
singer 
got 
quite 
popular during the latter half 
of 2017 after the release of 
his high-water mark single 
“do re mi,” which is actually 
a pretty good song. The rest 
of blackbear’s music is OK, 
I suppose. I would compare 
it to a well-baked loaf of 
white bread: Competent in 
execution, 
but 
bland 
and 
unsurprising. 
Despite 
his 
insipid but otherwise harmless 
music, blackbear manages to 
be actively insufferable due to 
his lyrics and persona.
Blackbear 
is 
proof 
that 
singing about drugs and sex 
does not automatically make 
you cool; this is a guy who 
is trying way, way, too hard. 
Blackbear evidently wants to 
occupy a role similar to that 
of The Weeknd, but due to his 
astounding lack of nuance and 
subtlety, his persona comes 
off as less of a tortured yet 
attractive rogue and more like 
the three-way love child of 
Adam Levine, one of those guys 
who comment on PornHub 
videos and a cigarette.
Blackbear has two lyrical 
modes, and both are hackneyed 
and lazy. One is the “revenge 
love” theme, where he has 
nothing to say that hasn’t been 
said a million times before by 
other “revenge love” songs (a 
theme that generally makes its 

way into his tweets, as we’ll 
soon see). The other mode is 
a clumsy attempt at imitating 
the 
braggadocious 
and 
materialistic aesthetic found 
in a good deal of hip hop/R&B, 
except with none of the humor, 
charm or self-awareness. The 
effect is cold and caustic, 
giving rise to songs devoid of 
personality with catchiness 
as the only redeeming factor. 
There’s 
nothing 
inherently 
wrong with this. Music can 
still be memorable even if it 
isn’t meaningful, but his lyrics 
and aesthetic suggest that he 
takes himself more seriously 
than he should.
Let’s play a game.
Below are six tweets, three 
of which are taken directly 
from 
blackbear’s 
official 
Twitter account, while the 
other three have been taken 
from Bryson Tiller parody 
accounts. The game is to 
guess whose are whose. In the 
interest of fairness all letters 
have been made lowercase, all 
“you”s have been changed to 
“u”s, all “to”s and “too”s have 
been changed to “2”s and all 
“for”s have been changed to 
“4”s.
1. “wasted so much time 
wishing i was good enough 4 u”
2. “i loved u at my worst u 
only love me cuz im at my best”
3. 
“don’t 
fight 
4 
their 
attention. if they really care, u 
shouldn’t have 2”
4. “worst part is i’ll never 
know”
5. “wasted hella time on u”
6. “they ain’t down 4 u like 

i am”
Correct answer: blackbear is 
the author of tweets 1, 2 and 4, 
while tweets 3, 5, 6 belong to 
an assortment of inspirational 
Bryson Tiller parody accounts. 
If you aced it, congratulations, 
because even after writing the 
quiz, I still couldn’t. A quick 
glance at blackbear’s Twitter 
page will make clear that these 
are not isolated examples — 
he really is just that goddamn 
corny.
What’s such a shame about 
blackbear is that he does 
actually possess some talent: 
He has a great voice and a 
knack for catchy melodies. 
His instrumentals are never 
particularly 
innovative, 
but 
they are well-crafted. The 
problem 
is 
both 
that 
his 
lyrics are intolerably vapid 
and that his public persona is 
inescapable, pervading every 
aspect of his music, from 
his inane song titles (e.g. “i 
hope ur whole life sux”) to 
his 
derivative 
and 
cloying 
lyrics (“Cause I have hella 
feelings for you / I act like I 
don’t fucking care / ’Cause 
I’m so fucking scared,” etc). 
If he would drop his odious 
pose, his music would be 
tolerable, maybe even good. 
But given his general lack of 
self-awareness or tact, I find 
this situation unlikely. Until 
that happens, it’s impossible 
to listen to blackbear’s music 
without remembering that this 
is the same guy who tweets 
stuff like, “i think of u often 
hope u kno.”

will never get used 2 it

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

American 
folk 
music, 
to 
me, is a tradition that’s as 
rich as the stories behind it. 
Combining elements from song 
and story, folk music has been 
an American tradition for years 
and continues to thrive all 
across the country.
However, 
with 
music 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
commercial 
over 
the 
past 
100 years, the medium has 
taken motives of passion and 
expression and shifted to more 
monetary driven intentions, and 
it sometimes shows. This isn’t 
me trying to discredit any genre 
— it’s just a fact. As music has 
become more valuable, whether 
it 
be 
through 
increasing 
accessibility or just the sheer 
rise in the number of people 
listening to and producing their 
own music, it has become a 
commercial industry.
Despite this fact, Mountain 
Heart — a group that borrows 
from 
folk, 
Americana 
and 
bluegrass — continues to write 
music reflecting not only their 
roots, but the roots of the genre 
as a whole. Although they’ve 
been around for almost 20 
years, they’ve remained true to 
their sound and kept a tradition 
of storytelling alive and well.
With 
their 
upcoming 
performance 
at 
The 
Ark’s 
Folk Festival, The Daily spoke 
with lead singer, guitarist and 
keyboardist Josh Shilling about 

the group’s new album, playing 
in Ann Arbor and what it’s like 
to be in a group that stays true 
to its roots.
Coming fresh out of recording 
their currently untitled album, 
Shilling says that they’re ready 
to share some new stories 
with audiences and return to 
some old ones. After their last 
album, Blue Skies, Shilling told 
his groupmates that they were 
going to have a really tough 
time “beating the songs that 
they wrote for that album.”
Shilling 
said 
that 
this 
upcoming 
album 
is 
unique 
because while he had written 
most of the songs in the past, this 
album features songs written by 
the group as a collective.
“As a band, we’ve never sat 
around together and written 
one 
song,” 
Shilling 
shared, 
“but 
with 
this 
upcoming 
song, ‘Restless Wind’ ... It 
was a collective effort. The 
songwriting is killer.”
And the recordings feel like 
just that.
“We’re playing and singing 
live,” he said. “It’s about as raw 
and organic as you can get. It 
feels like you’re in the room 
with us.”
Continuing on with their 
legacy of sharing themselves 
with the audience, both through 
a recorded medium and live on 
stage, Mountain Heart wanted 
this album to feel the same live 
as it feels recorded.
Even after playing all over 
the world, Ann Arbor remains 
as one of the group’s favorite 

cities.
“It really always feels like 
a second home to us,” Shilling 
said. “The fans are huge music 
lovers and supporters ... They 
really make us feel at home. It’s 
really special.”
It’s one of the reasons why 
they come back almost every 
winter, and it’s why they decided 
to record their live album here 
back in 2007. Along with the 
fans, Shilling commented on 
how fantastic the acts are that 
play at The Ark, saying that he 
doesn’t think that he’s “ever 
seen a bad act play that stage … 
They just have great taste.”
“If I lived in Ann Arbor, I’m 
sure I’d be hanging around at 
The Ark all the time,” he said.
This isn’t Mountain Heart’s 
first time at the Folk Festival, 
either. About a decade ago, they 
graced the stage in Ann Arbor, 
and they couldn’t be more 
excited to return.
“I remember the lineup then 
was just phenomenal,” Shilling 
said, “and this lineup with John 
Prine, Jason Isbell, Aimee Mann 
… all those folks. Everyone’s 
phenomenal. They really seem 
to get it right. I don’t think any 
artist would turn this down … 
Who wouldn’t want to be part 
of this?”
Tickets are selling out quickly 
for both Friday and Saturday 
nights of the Folk Festival, 
but Mountain Heart will be 
returning in April for those who 
will be missing the Folk Festival 
and still want to be swept away 
by the stories of the group.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

RYAN COX
Daily Arts Writer

As a guilty pleasure watcher 
of 
the 
“Stomp 
the 
Yard” 
movies, I had a simple request 
for Netflix’s new movie “Step 
Sisters”: Entertain me. No need 
for great acting or a decent 
screenplay, 
just 
entertain. 
Unfortunately, “Step Sisters” 
has 
such 
a 
convoluted 
message 
on 
race, 
cultural 
appropriation and sisterhood 
that any enjoyment is tinged 
with confusion. A movie that 
makes fun of white people 
should elicit a few laughs or 
ah-ha moments, but perhaps 
“Get Out” set the bar too 
high. Instead, “Step Sisters” 
struggles to overcome a faulty 
premise that even its pizazzy 
dance numbers cannot conceal.
Jamilah 
(Megalyn 
Echikunwoke, “CHiPs”), an 
overachieving college student, 
has high hopes for Harvard 
Law School. She also has the 
credentials necessary to fulfill 
her 
dream: 
legacy 
status, 
volunteer work at a local 
community center, president 
of a Black sorority and a killer 
work ethic. When the dean of 
Westcott University promises 
to write a recommendation 
letter for Jamilah, in exchange 
for her teaching an unruly 
and majority white sorority 
(Sigma Beta Beta) how to step, 

she agrees. The implications 
of a group of white girls 
taking over a dance style with 
deep African roots make her 
uncomfortable, though, so she 
hides her association with SBB 
from her family and friends. 
(Yes, this plot sounds exactly 

like “Bring It On.” No, the film 
does not live up to the same 
standard).
Unlike other commercially 
successful 
female 
ensemble 
films 
like 
“Pitch 
Perfect,” 
“Step Sisters” does not have 
that one actor who holds up the 
rest of the team. Echikunwoke 
gives her best effort, but her 
character’s motivations are so 
poorly written that even she 
cannot deliver an applaudable 
performance. 
Furthermore, 
in comparison to other dance 
or 
singing-oriented 
films, 
the 
cast 
lacks 
chemistry. 
The oddball aspects of each 
individual are not explored. All 
that’s left are stock characters 
with backgrounds that allow 
for forced perspectives on the 
controversial situation.
“Step Sisters” has moments 
of self-awareness regarding 
the cultural appropriation its 
plot toys with. At one point, 
Jamilah exclaims that races 
can’t own things — not rap, 
not golf, not dance. However, 

the idea that white people 
who have trained a few weeks 
can beat people of color with 
a strong history of stepping at 
a national competition does 
not sit well. (Not to mention 
the 
unaddressed 
inclusion 
of a step group that wore 
traditional 
Chinese 
qipaos 
as 
their 
costumes, 
toted 
oriental 
fans 
and 
sported 
stereotypical 
haircuts. 
But 
let’s not get into that.) Mixed 
in with this semi-hypocritical 
message, “Step Sisters” makes 
occasional jabs at different 
forms of problematic liberals 
like Jamilah’s boyfriend Dane 
(Matt McGorry, “How to Get 
Away with Murder”), who 
embraces Black culture as a 
way to prove his “wokeness.”
With 
the 
involvement 
of 
Chuck 
Hayward 
from 
“Dear 
White 
People” 
and 
Lena Waithe from “Master 
of None,” “Step Sisters” has 
enough talent to create a 
more nuanced and fresh take 
on race relations. The film 
instead 
tramples 
through 
sensitive issues with faux pas 
and cringe-inducing banter. 
However, the film does try to 
promote the idea of unity and 
the performances are well-
choreographed with plenty of 
fire. Although “Step Sisters” 
fails to deliver an articulate or 
enlightening lesson on cultural 
appropriation, it does make the 
subject more approachable. 

Clunky ‘Step Sisters’ can’t 
move to the right rhythm

Friday, January 26, 2018 — 7

The No. 16 Michigan women’s 

basketball team is cruising, and 
the road ahead looks clear.

Having pummeled Michigan 

State on Tuesday, 74-48, the 
Wolverines (7-2 Big Ten, 18-4 
overall) are currently on a 
five-game winning streak that 
includes victories over then-No. 
8 Ohio State in Columbus, as 
well as a monstrous, 44-point 
win against Illinois.

Michigan now ranks second 

in the Big Ten standings and 
is well on its way to qualifying 
for the NCAA Tournament. If 
there ever was a time for the 
Wolverines to take a breather 
and pat themselves on the back, it 
would be this weekend, heading 
into Sunday’s matchup against 
a bottom-feeding Northwestern 
team.

But that is not what Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico has 
planned for her team. She is 
already planning for the trip 
ahead as Michigan gets set to 
face the Wildcats (2-5, 9-12) 
Sunday afternoon in Evanston.

“We just have to be locked 

in, focused,” Barnes Arico told 
WTKA. “Every matchup in our 
league is a great matchup. You 
can’t go by anyone’s record.”

The Wildcats graduated star 

forward Nia Coffey from last 
year’s team that finished with 
a 20-11 record. With four new 
freshmen on the roster, they 
are much younger than before. 
But with youth comes growing 
pains, and these have been 
apparent. Northwestern has lost 
four of its last five games and sits 
at twelfth in the conference.

On top of the growing pains, 

captain Lydia Rohde’s injury 
midway through the season has 
also weakened the Wildcats. 
The senior guard is a gifted 
shooter and a key part of her 
team’s offense, shooting over 
40 percent from beyond the arc. 
Rohde is one of the few veterans 
on a team filled with youngsters. 

Without her, Northwestern is 
without its leader.

The Wildcats also suffer from 

the absence of another talented 
guard. Junior Amber Jamison 
— who started in 11 contests her 
sophomore year — has taken 
a leave of absence this season, 
weakening 
Northwestern’s 

backcourt depth further.

With 
all 
the 

changes 
in 
the 

depth 
chart, 

others 
have 

had to step up. 
Unexpected 
contributions 
have come from 
freshman 
guard 

Lindsey Pulliam, 
sophomore 
forward 
Abi 

Scheid 
and 

junior forward Pallas Kunaiyi-
Akpanah who lead the team 
in 
scoring, 
averaging 
14.0, 

12.9 and 10.6 points per game, 
respectively.

It is unlikely the Wildcats 

will be able to keep up with 
the Wolverines and 3-point 
markswoman Katelynn Flaherty. 
The senior guard averages 23.3 
points per contest and has made 
tremendous improvements in 
running the point. Against the 
Spartans, Flaherty showed off 
her passing ability, racking up 
six assists and creating countless 
scoring chances for her team 

when she drew double teams.

Even if Northwestern finds 

a way to contain Flaherty, 
Michigan has no shortage of 
firepower. Junior center Hallie 
Thome and junior guard Nicole 
Munger continue to significantly 
contribute to the offense, and 
freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown has also shown potential. 

And 
even 
if 

the 
Wildcats 

can 
stump 

Michigan’s 
offense, 
its 

stout 
defense 

— it allows just 
60.1 points per 
game 
— 
has 

rescued 
the 

team before.

Given these 

circumstances, 

the Wolverines should have 
a fairly smooth ride against 
Northwestern, 
barring 
an 

unacceptable performance.

But Barnes Arico wants to 

make sure there are no bumps 
at all, and wants her team to stay 
focused.

“You just have to play the best 

Michigan basketball that we can 
play,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
wanna make sure that there is 
never a doubt moving forward 
that we are putting ourselves in 
a position to win a championship 
and be selected in the NCAA 
Tournament.”

Report: Enos leaving for Alabama

The 2017 Michigan football 

team’s offensive woes were no 
secret.

Watch 
footage 
of 
the 

Wolverines 
and 
it 
becomes 

apparent almost immediately. 
Michigan’s pass offense had the 
fourth-fewest yards per game 
and total passing touchdowns 
in the Big Ten, an amalgam of 
a porous line and indecisive 
quarterback play. The shiftiness 
of Karan Higdon and Chris 
Evans were a band-aid as the 
run game averaged 177.7 yards 
per game.

For a 2018 season already 

littered 
with 
sky-high 

expectations, 
Michigan 
has 

reportedly 
hired 
Minnesota 

offensive line coach and run 
game coordinator Ed Warinner 
to shore up a weak offensive line 
— one that is also losing its most 
consistent talent in left tackle 
Mason Cole.

Football Scoop broke the 

news of Warinner’s hire on 
Saturday, a report that was 
quickly met with speculation 

on social media. The following 
day, Football Scoop reported 
that Warinner was a strong 
candidate to join forces with 
new Tennessee Titans head 
coach Mike Vrabel — the pair 
coached together at Ohio State 
— and no longer considered for 
the Wolverines’ opening.

As of the publishing of this 

story, 
Warinner’s 
Twitter 

profile appears to have put 
these rumors to bed, despite no 
official statement. His profile 
picture and cover photo display 
the Block ‘M’ and a portrait 
of Michigan Stadium, and his 
biography reads “University of 
Michigan.”

Under Warinner last season, 

the Golden Gophers’ run game 
finished third in the Big Ten 
in rushing yards per game 
(182.4), led by Rodney Smith. 
In his previous coaching stint 
at Ohio State as an offensive 
coordinator, 
the 
Buckeyes’ 

rushing attack finished in the 
top 15 nationally in every season 
of his five-year tenure there. 

Warinner’s official title and 

job responsibilities have not 
been released yet. Currently, all 

10 of the Wolverines’ available 
coaching positions are filled, 
which would relegate Warinner 
to an analyst role — that title 
limits 
him 
from 
coaching 

on-field 
or 
participating 
in 

recruitment efforts.

A coaching position may be 

opening soon, though. Dan Enos 
— who was reported to have 
joined Michigan’s staff as a wide 
receivers coach on Jan. 10 — is 
expected to become an associate 
coach and quarterbacks coach 
at Alabama, according to Pete 
Thamel of Yahoo Sports.

Enos 
was 
initially 
hired 

away as Arkansas’ offensive 
coordinator and would have 
been tasked with developing a 
young wide receiver core that 
played to their inexperience in 
2017. Junior Grant Perry and 
freshman 
Donovan 
Peoples-

Jones 
led 
the 
Wolverines’ 

receivers with 307 and 277 
receiving yards, respectively.

Michigan 
will 
have 
its 

work cut out to improve on 
a disappointing 8-5 season, 
but it’ll have to figure out its 
coaching staff first if it hopes to 
take that next step.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh may be on the hunt for another assistant coach soon.

“Every 

matchup in our 
league is a great 

matchup.”

Against No. 6 Ohio State, Wolverines will find out how far they’ve come

It has taken over three months, 

but the overarching narrative 
of the Michigan hockey team’s 
season finally appears to have 
found some stability.

The Wolverines brought their 

high-octane 
offense 
to 
Penn 

State in October and earned an 
encouraging split against the 
defending Big Ten champions. 
Two weeks later, they took four 
points from Minnesota thanks 
to two furious comebacks in the 
third 
period. 
The 
rebuilding 

process after a 13-19-2 season 
appeared to be ahead of schedule.

But this momentum hit a wall 

shortly after, as Michigan won 
only one of its next seven games 
while allowing 4.3 goals per 
contest. This wasn’t a team even 
close to being ready for serious Big 
Ten contention.

That is, until the Wolverines 

went to Mariucci Arena and 
swept the Golden Gophers in 
Minneapolis for the first time 
since 1977. The next week, they 
held the Nittany Lions — the 
nation’s highest-scoring offense 

— to zero goals during even-
strength play en route to a second 
consecutive sweep, vaulting from 
sixth to third in the conference 
standings in just nine days.

Michigan has seen multiple 

scoring lines develop, including 
the emergence of junior Brendan 
Warren, sophomore Jake Slaker 
and 
freshman 

Josh 
Norris 
to 

complement 
the 

first line of seniors 
Dexter Dancs and 
Tony 
Calderone 

and 
junior 

Cooper Marody. 
Sophomore 
Hayden Lavigne 
stood 
on 
his 

head all weekend 
against 
Penn 

State, saving 77 of 79 shots, and 
has firmly asserted himself as the 
Wolverines’ top goaltender. In 
the words of coach Mel Pearson, 
Michigan has figured out “how to 
play to have success.”

“One thing that Mel always 

tells us is it’s about the process,” 
Norris said. “Especially (in the) 
last six or seven games, I think 
we’ve done a good job of sticking 

to our systems and our strengths 
as a team.”

The 
seventeenth-ranked 

Wolverines (7-7-2 Big Ten, 12-10-
2 overall) will need to do that and 
more this weekend, as they travel 
three hours down the road to 
battle with No. 6 Ohio State (8-5-1, 
15-5-4) in a matchup that will test 

just how much 
the 
Wolverines 

have progressed 
this season.

On 
the 
last 

weekend 
of 

November, 
the 
Buckeyes 

defeated 
Michigan, 3-2 and 
5-1, at Yost Ice 
Arena. 
Neither 

game 
was 
as 

close as the scores suggest. Ohio 
State was comprehensively better 
in every facet of play, and the 
Wolverines were, in their own 
words, outworked.

“The makeup came off and we 

saw a lot of the blemishes this 
weekend,” Pearson said on Nov. 
25. “We were able to cover some 
things up, (but) this weekend 
we saw a little bit of some of the 

issues that we’re going to have 
going forward.”

Those issues — including, but 

not 
limited 
to, 
undisciplined 

defense, lack of offensive depth 
and inconsistent 
goaltending 
— 

were met quite 
convincingly 
against 
Minnesota 
and 

Penn State. But 
the 
Buckeyes 

are still every bit 
the 
well-oiled 

machine 
they 

were two months 
ago.

In fact, Ohio State may be even 

better at this point. It has won 
seven of its last eight, allowing 
just 15 goals in those games. Two 
weeks ago, the Buckeyes blew out 
the Nittany Lions, 5-1, in State 
College, snapping Penn State’s 

11-game unbeaten streak.

Ohio State relies mainly on a 

stingy defense that allows just 2.1 
goals per game, with goaltender 
Sean Romeo and his .924 save 

percentage 
serving 
as 
the 

backbone. It is 
formidable 
on 

special 
teams, 

having 
killed 

90.1 percent of its 
penalties, a figure 
which leads the 
nation.

But 
the 

Buckeyes 
have 

their 
share 
of 

playmakers on offense as well. 
Forward Tanner Laczynski is the 
engine that makes their offense 
go, leading the nation with 23 
assists and ranking third with 34 
points. Mathew Weis and Mason 
Jobst complement Laczynski with 

26 and 23 points, respectively.

Yes, Michigan has its work 

cut out for it this weekend. But 
that’s just the reality of life in the 
Big Ten. There are no breaks, no 
rewards for success. Only really 
good teams, week in and week 
out.

But 
the 
Wolverines 
are 

confident that they’re one of 
those teams, that they’re fit to 
survive the pressure cooker 
that is this conference. Their 
performance this month backs 
up that belief.

Now, they must back it up once 

again.

“We go into games really 

confident, and we know that we 
can beat anybody when we play 
our best,” Norris said. “When 
we have all the guys on the same 
string and we’re in the same boat, 
we have a really good chance of 
winning every game.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Moritz Wagner and Michigan had no answer for Purdue center Isaac Haas.

HAASTA LA VISTA

No. 25 Michigan falls to No. 3 Purdue, 92-88

It would have been easy for 

Michigan to get swallowed up 
on Thursday night.

Just like in Chapel Hill, and 

more recently in Lincoln, the 
Wolverines faced a halftime 
deficit against a high-octane 
offense and a defense that had 
their number in an environment 
as hostile as it gets.

In 
response, 
Michigan’s 

offense went nuts to begin the 
second half, making every shot 
it took and averaging 2.286 
points per possession through 
the first 10 minutes of the 
frame.

It was an offensive onslaught 

that would be good enough to 
put away almost any game. Not 
against Purdue, though. The 
Boilermakers stood tall, taking 
each punch the Wolverines 
threw and delivering one of 
their own in response en route 
to an eventual 92-88 victory.

For 
nearly 
11 
minutes, 

though, the teams played the 
most entertaining stretch of 
basketball in any Michigan 

game this season, one that 
yielded one of the best individual 
performances for a Wolverine 
in any game this season — from 
senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman.

The 
stretch 
started 

unassuming 
enough, 
with 

a missed three from junior 
forward Moritz Wagner. But 
redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Charles Matthews was there 
to clean up the miss, laying in a 
putback to get the ball rolling.

That 
was 
immediately 

answered by a 3-pointer from 
Boilermaker 
guard 
Dakota 

Mathias. And away the teams 
went.

For every shot there was a 

counter. The teams combined 
to shoot 24-for-30 from the 
field in the opening 10:50 of the 
second half.

“This is what you come 

to a Big Ten school to play 
basketball for,” said Purdue 
forward Vincent Edwards. “… 
That second half was a dream 
to play basketball in. So, I mean, 
we all soaked it in.”

It was the type of half that 

would 
have 
left 
Michigan 

grasping at air earlier in the 
season. Maybe that would have 
happened on Thursday, too, if it 
weren’t for Abdur-Rahkman.

The senior hit a layup at the 

18:28 mark. Then he stole the 
ball away from Purdue guard 
Carsen Edwards to start a 
fastbreak that ended in a dunk 
from Matthews that gave the 
Wolverines the lead for the first 
time in the half. Then Abdur-
Rahkman hit three go-ahead 
3-pointers in the span of five 
minutes, with the last one being 
a fall-away job from the left 
corner with 9:38 remaining.

When the stretch was over, 

Abdur-Rahkman had scored 14 
of his 26 total points in just 11 
minutes.

“I just got a couple easy shots 

— a layup and a wide-open 

three — and got going early, and 
just played confident.” Abdur-
Rahkman said.

Added Michigan coach John 

Beilein: “To have Muhammad-
Ali 
play 
that 
way 
is 
the 

expectation we have of seniors. 
That’s the trend I hope we’re 
going to see the rest of this 
season. (It’s) a little bit about 
the time when Derrick Walton 
took off, was about this time 
last year.”

What the game means for 

Abdur-Rahkman’s future aside, 
the performance was one that 
nearly gave Michigan another 
marquee win. It was one that 
nearly thrust the Wolverines 
head-first 
into 
national 

prominence.

But it didn’t.
When 
Abdur-Rahkman 

hit his first layup of the half, 
Purdue guard P.J. Thompson 
answered with a 3-pointer. 
Matthews’ dunk was answered 
with a bucket from Boilermaker 
center Isaac Haas in the post. 
All three of Abdur-Rahkman’s 
go-ahead 
3-pointers 
were 

erased by a Purdue bucket 
within the next minute. Twice, 
it was on the next possession.

In the end, the Wolverines 

were outlasted by a tireless 
Boilermaker 
team, 
as 
the 

memorable back-and-forth was 
followed by an 11-2 run from 
Purdue that ultimately spelled 
doom for Michigan.

Yet, for 11 minutes, the two 

teams stared each other down, 
daring the other to blink and 
lose control of the game. It 
didn’t matter how close the 
defender was or if the shooter’s 
feet were set, the shots were 
falling from wherever they 
were taken.

For 
11 
minutes, 
the 

Wolverines 
and 
the 

Boilermakers 
showed 
what 

they’re each capable of when 
they’re on their games. Purdue 
simply proved it for longer. 

Back-and-forth stretch not enough for ‘M’

“America, meet Purdue.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

The third-ranked Boilermakers are a tough matchup for anyone with their combination of size and shooting.
T

he pregame theatrics at 
Mackey Arena are quite a 

sight.

Blink-

ing lights 
scatter 
the arena, 
the ritual 
chants 
splatter 
expletives 
at in-
state rival 
Indiana. 
Students 
line the seats to the rafters, 
swaying back and forth in prepa-
ration. Right before the lineup 
announcements and tip-off — 
just seconds before the lights 
dim and the show begins — a 
video starts on the jumbotron. 
There’s one sentence before the 
crowd renders it nearly inau-
dible. 

“America, meet Purdue.”
With a 92-88 win over 

Michigan Thursday night, the 
Boilermakers have now won 16 
games in a row. It’s a team that 

embarassed Arizona and Lou-
isville early in the year. Since, it 
has only steamrolled opponents 
on the way to a perfect confer-
ence record. It has arguably 
the most unguardable center 
in the nation, surrounding him 
with four players who shoot 40 
percent or better from 3-point 
range.

“You have five lights out 

shooters — I 
mean, lights 
out,” said Michi-
gan coach John 
Beilein. “Nik 
Stauskas, Tim 
Hardaway, Trey 
Burke, right? But 
with five of them 
on the perimeter, 
with an incred-
ible big man. It’s 
a very difficult 
challenge for everybody.

“I don’t think I’m crazy, you 

guys have seen teams that have 
come into the Big Ten. Who 
has five guys that shoot on the 
run? They don’t even have to get 
themselves open.”

It all starts with behemoth 

center Isaac Haas. Each time the 
7-foot-2 center touches the ball 
in the paint without an imme-
diate double-team, a chorus of 
suprised cheer rains around the 
arena, as if they’re collectively 
getting away with some crime.

Perhaps single-teaming Haas 

should be a crime. If given posi-
tion in the lane, Haas catches 

and lays the ball 
in with incompo-
rable inevitabil-
ity. He scored all 
six of his team’s 
points in the first 
four minutes 
of the game, 
and notched 
24 points on 14 
shots in just 20 
minutes. 

“You guys try 

and go guard him,” Beilein said. 
“It is impossible.”

But that’s what makes Purdue 

so difficult to play: Beilein didn’t 
even care that Haas was domi-
nating.

“If Haas scored 40 points with 

20 twos it’s okay with us,” he 
said. “But we weren’t going to 
give up the three. We couldn’t do 
that. They’re just too good.”

For much of the game Thurs-

day night, though, Michigan 
matched Purdue shot for shot.

Senior guard Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rahkman played 
arguably the best game of his 
career, notching 
26 points with 
step-back threes 
and even some 
uncharacteristic 
bravado. Sopho-
more point guard 
Zavier Simpson 
notched a career-
high 16 points of 
his own.

In total, the 

Wolverines 
scored an absurd 1.48 points 
per possession, made eight of its 
12 3-point attempts, scored 52 
points and got 29 points com-
bined from Abdur-Rahkman and 

junior center Moritz Wagner in 
the second half. And lost.

Purdue took every blow, and 

punched back. It matched every 
Wagner attack with a Haas 
hammer, followed every Abdur-
Rahkman deep three with a 
deeper one of its own. In the end, 
the Boilermakers emerged with 
a 92-88 victory, and continued 

on its torment-
ing run of domi-
nance. 

Purdue ranks 

third nationally 
in the Associated 
Press top-25. It 
also ranks top-
10 nationally in 
both adjusted 
offensive and 
defensive effi-
ciency. 

“They provide a difficult 

matchup with size inside and the 
shooters everywhere. Not many 
teams are like them,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “We kept fighting 

until the end, but it just wasn’t 
enough.”

And yet, perhaps based on 

preconceived notions or past his-
tory, the Boilermakers still aren’t 
getting their due nationally.

The Boilermakers haven’t 

made it past the Sweet Sixteen 
since the 1999-2000 season. Last 
year they reached the Sweet 
Sixteen only to be eviscerated, 
98-66, by Kansas. Only time will 
tell if this team is, indeed, differ-
ent in the postseason.

But that doesn’t faze them.
“I believe we’re a really good 

team,” Haas said after the game, 
before pausing to reconsider that 
stance. “I believe we’re the best 
team in the nation. And I just 
want to show everybody.”

America, meet Purdue.
You’ll be seeing quite a bit of 

them come March and April.

Zavier Simpson thought he had 

it.

With his team desperate for 

a bucket, the sophomore point 
guard jutted into the lane and 
rolled a layup off his fingertips. A 
make would’ve put the Michigan 
men’s basketball team within one 
shot of Purdue.

But Boilermakers guard Carsen 

Edwards had different plans. 
Edwards poked the attempt away. 
The Wolverines would finish the 
possession empty-handed.

The play proved to be a 

microcosm of Thursday night.

Michigan played one of its best 

games of the season, shooting 
60 percent from the floor with a 
13-for-23 effort from deep.

Yet, 
like 
Simpson 
against 

Edwards, the Wolverines couldn’t 
surpass one of the country’s best.

In a contest that featured 24 

lead changes, No. 3 Purdue (8-0 
Big Ten, 20-2 overall) outlasted 
the 25th-ranked Wolverines (6-4, 
17-6), 92-88, at a raucous Mackey 
Arena on Thursday.

Led 
by 
30 
points 
from 

guard Vincent Edwards, the 
Boilermakers made 31 of 50 
attempts on the night to score the 
most they have in conference play. 

“You can’t win a game without 

defense — they scored 92 points 
today,” 
said 
junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner. “We gotta do 
better defensively.”

Those 
struggles 
were 

compounded by Purdue guards 
who seemingly couldn’t miss 
from outside, shooting 55 percent 
from beyond the arc.

The Wolverines allow just over 

five 3-pointers per game. Purdue 
hit 11 Thursday.

“I think we’re one of the 

leaders in the country (in 3-point 
defense),” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “If (center Isaac) 
Haas scored 40 points, we’re 
okay, but we weren’t going to give 

up the 3. We couldn’t do that.”

Still, the Wolverines were able 

to match Purdue for most of the 
night.

Early in the second half, a pair 

of triples and a layup from senior 
guard Muhammed-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman gave Michigan a one-
point lead.

He’d really start to feel it, 

wearing his pink-coated Jordan’s 
amidst a sea of black and gold, ten 
minutes later.

With the game tied at 65, 

Abdur-Rakhman 
spotted 
up 

from the 3-point line. Calm and 
collected as always, he pulled the 
trigger even as Dakota Mathias 
came charging towards him. No 
panic, just buckets — giving the 
Wolverines the lead with roughly 
nine minutes to play.

But Purdue always had an 

answer. 
It 
came 
frequently 

courtesy of Vincent Edwards.

With a triple and pair of layups, 

he scored seven straight points 
for the Boilermakers as they went 
on an 11-2 run to take a nine-point 
lead.

“You can’t stop some of the 

shots that Vince Edwards made,” 
Beilein said. “They were just too 
good for us tonight.”

Michigan crawled back and cut 

the deficit to four with a minute 
and change left. But timely 
steals and 11-of-12 free-throws 
down the stretch sealed it for the 
Boilermakers.

“Shots were going in,” Abdur-

Rahkman said, “and we knew we 
needed to weather their storm as 
much as possible, then bounce 
back. We didn’t do that enough.”

As he was for most of the 

night, Haas was unstoppable 
— 
especially 
in 
the 
game’s 

opening moments. A feed, spin 
and hook shot was the seven-
footer’s go-to combination for the 
Boilermakers’ first three baskets.

The Wolverines couldn’t stop 

him from getting the ball inside. 
Carsen Edwards and Mathias 
made strong entry passes to end 

whatever chances the Wolverines 
had of guarding Haas down low.

“He’s impossible to guard, and 

he’s a bad matchup for us,” Beilein 
said. “You probably need a twin 
brother to guard him in the post.”

The Wolverines kept things in 

the first half close thanks to an 
unlikely source.

Early in the half, Beilein pulled 

his starting point guard aside 
after a bricked 3-pointer. But 
Simpson made his second attempt 
from deep — and more — count, 
finishing with a career-high 16 
points.

In the end, though, it was yet 

another effort from Simpson 
and the Wolverines that came 
up 
just 
short 
against 
the 

Boilermakers.

Their first meeting went to 

the wire on Jan. 9 — but two 
late calls and the game went 
Purdue’s way, 70-69. 

Fifth-year 
senior 
Duncan 

Robinson said that first matchup 
didn’t “sit well” on Wednesday.

Thursday’s loss will feel the 

same way. 

“It’s incredible,” Beilein said. 

“They didn’t miss a shot and we 
almost came out of here with a 
‘W’ ”

“They provide 

a difficult 

matchup with 
size inside.”

“You guys try 
and go guard 

him. It is 

impossible.”
