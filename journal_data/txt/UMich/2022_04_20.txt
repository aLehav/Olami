ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Former music 
professor sentenced to 
prison for sex crimes

In the mid-1980s, a North 
Carolina School of the Arts 
student took a brave step that 
affected the rest of her high 
school career: she met with 
Robert Hickok, the school’s dean, 
to report that Stephen Shipps, her 
violin teacher, had attempted to 
kiss her during her lesson.
The 
student 
requested 
anonymity, citing professional 
concerns. As in The Michigan 
Daily’s previous reporting about 
Shipps’s alleged harassment and 
abuse, she will be referred to as 
Meghan. In a Dec. 2018 interview 
with The Daily, the student 
remembered Hickok’s response. 
“(Shipps is) a very affectionate 
man: ‘Are you sure you didn’t 
misunderstand 
it?’” 
Meghan 
recalled Hickok saying. (Hickok 
is 
deceased; 
two 
students 
attending the school at the time 
corroborated 
that 
they 
were 
aware of Meghan’s allegation.) 
A few years later, in the summer 
of 1989, another faculty member 
became aware of allegations of 
Shipps’s abuse. By that time, 
Shipps 
had 
left 
the 
North 
Carolina School of the Arts;he 
was scheduled to begin teaching 
at the University of Michigan in 
the fall. 
In a Dec. 2018 interview with 
The Daily, an Ann Arbor musician 
with extensive ties to the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
community alleged that she spoke 
with a Music, Theatre & Dance 
School professor about the rumors 
of sexual misconduct that had 
followed Shipps to the University 
of Michigan. This musician also 
requested 
anonymity, 
citing 
professional concerns.
“I heard this guy is a scumbag,” 
the musician told the professor, 
adding 
some 
details 
about 
the 
aforementioned 
sexual 
misconduct allegations. 

This past Thursday, Shipps was 
sentenced to five years in prison 
for repeatedly transporting a minor 
across state lines in 2002 while 
committing 
sexual 
misconduct 
against her. This sentencing came 
over three years after a Michigan 
Daily 
investigation 
uncovered 
numerous previously undisclosed 
allegations of sexual harassment, 
misconduct and assault against 
Shipps at the University of Michigan, 
the North Carolina School of the 
Arts and the University of Nebraska-
Omaha.
In 1995, according to reporting 
from 
The 
News 
& 
Observer, 
administrators at the North Carolina 
School of the Arts were made aware 
of eight complaints against Shipps. 
It is unclear if Meghan’s allegation 
comprised one of these reports. 
It is also unclear if the school 
communicated these complaints to 
the University of Michigan.
In 2017, a former student of 
Shipps’s emailed the then-interim 
dean of the Music, Theatre & Dance 
School to report her experience 
of alleged statutory rape while 
studying with Shipps in the late 
1970s at the University of Nebraska-
Omaha. At the time of this email, 
Shipps was a tenured professor of 
music, the chair of strings and the 
director of a youth music program 
through the Music, Theatre & 
Dance School. He had previously 
served as the school’s associate 
dean.
The former student that emailed 
the dean requested anonymity, 
citing professional concerns. As 
in The Daily’s previous reporting 
about Shipps’s alleged harassment 
and abuse, she will be referred to as 
Jane.
“Stephen Shipps raped me when 
I was sixteen,” Jane wrote in her 
email to the interim dean. “Over the 
years, I’ve heard stories similar to 
mine regarding Mr. Shipps.”

Stephen Shipps receives five years after 
guilty verdict on exploitation of a minor

The 
Arab 
Heritage 
Month Closing Ceremony 
took place at the Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
Thursday night. Hosted by 
the office of Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs (MESA), the 
event concluded a month 
of Arab cultural festivities 
featuring 
workshops, 
performances 
and 
guest 
speakers. 
The 
ceremony 
began 
with Arabic food and people 

gathering 
around 
tables. 
MESA Program Manager 
Jesús 
Galvan 
greeted 
students and families as they 
walked into Trotter Center. 
Taubman 
freshman 
Lynn Samman, the event 
coordinator for the closing 
ceremony, 
began 
by 
thanking MESA and the 
Arab Student Association for 
their support in empowering 
the 
Arab 
community 
on 
campus. 
She 
then 
recognized each of the Arab 
Heritage Month committee 
members, thanking them 
for their work in putting on 

various events throughout 
the past month.
“We 
would 
like 
to 
recognize all our committee 
members 
for 
all 
their 
hard 
work,” 
Samman 
said. “Starting with the 
programming 
committee, 
then 
the 
marketing 
committee, and the finance 
committee, 
and 
special 
thank you to our manager 
and coordinators.”
Arab Heritage Month 
takes place in April every 
year and celebrates Arab 
heritage and culture, paying 
tribute to the contributions 

of over 3.7 million Arab 
Americans in the United 
States. It wasn’t until 2017 
that the Arab America 
Foundation began a national 
initiative to coordinate all 
states under National Arab 
American Heritage Month. 
In 2019, U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich., and U.S. 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., 
introduced a resolution to 
Congress to proclaim April 
as National Arab American 
Heritage Month.

 Asian American 
& Pacific 
Islander 
Heritage Month 
concludes 
with black-tie 

Acapella, dance performances 
highlighted at University of 
Michigan Museum of Art

The 
Office 
of 
Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs 
(MESA) 
hosted 
a 
black-tie 
gala 
to 
close 
out 
this 
year’s 
Asian 
American and Pacific 
Islander 
(AA&PI) 
Heritage 
Month 
Wednesday 
night. 
Students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members 
gathered 
at the University of 
Michigan Museum of 
Art for a festive night 
celebrating 
AA&PI 
culture and history. 
The theme of this 
year’s 
celebration, 
“Are You Listening? 
Oral 
Histories 
and 
Storytelling 
from 
AA&PI 
Communities,” 
was 
introduced 
at 
a 
virtual 
opening 
ceremony 
March 
17. LSA sophomore 

Aarushi 
Ganguly, 
a member of this 
event’s 
planning 
committee, 
spoke 
about 
the 
significance of the 
theme at the March 
17 opening ceremony.
“AA&PI 
populations have long 
been 
characterized 
as silent, which is 
a 
result 
of 
being 
washed 
over 
by 
imperialism, 
monolithic 
stereotypes 
and 
white 
supremacy,” 
Ganguly said. “This 
Heritage 
Month, 
we 
hope 
to 
call 
attention to the vast 
diversity 
within 
these 
communities. 
We will create space 
for individuals both 
in and outside of the 
AA&PI 
community 
to learn, reflect and 
grow.”

Dean Michael 
Barr nominated 
to Federal 
Reserve Board of 
Governors

 If confirmed, will serve as 
Vice Chair for Supervision, 
oversee banks’ compliance 
with capital regulations

President Joe Biden 
announced he would 
nominate Michael Barr, 
dean of the University of 
Michigan’s Ford School 
of Public Policy, as Vice 
Chair for Supervision 
of the Federal Reserve 
Friday 
morning. 
If

Treasury 
and 
State 
Departments during the 
Clinton administration 

and served as Assistant 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Treasury 
under 
the 
Obama administration. 
He 
also

Financial 
Protection Bureau and 
the 2010 Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
which 
changed 
financial regulations to 
reduce the economic 
impact of the 2008 Great 
Recession.
Barr’s 
selection 
comes 
after 
Biden’s 
first nominee, Sarah 
Bloom Raskin, failed 
to secure the Senate 
majority needed for her 
confirmation. 
Raskin 
submitted a letter to 
President 
Biden 
on

UMich R.A. finds Black History Month 
bulletin board vandalized, raises 
concerns over racism and housing
Incident draws hundreds of campus community reactions on social media, DPSS: 
declines to comment on whether vandalism will be treated as a hate crime

NIRALI PATEL
Daily Staff Reporter

Design by Reid Graham

On April 9, LSA senior Solomon Lucy, 
a resident adviser at Mary Markley 
Residence Hall, posted an Instagram 
video showing the bulletin board hanging 
in his hall vandalized with several papers 
torn down. Lucy’s board had featured 
posters celebrating Black History Month 
and Women’s History Month with 
photos of prominent Black women in 
history alongside a photo of himself as an 
introduction for his residents. 
When Lucy walked by the bulletin at 
3 a.m. on Friday, April 8, the board was 
destroyed and several of the photos 
were missing.

“No Black RA, student, faculty 
member, etc should EVER feel unsafe 
and targeted on this campus,” Lucy 
wrote in the caption of his Instagram 
post. “Although this truly breaks my 
heart, I am DETERMINED to bring 
more awareness to the situation & 
fight for change for the betterment of 
future Black wolverines & Black RAs 
to come.” 
Lucy also posted the video to 
Twitter on April 9. Faculty, students 
and various campus organizations 
shared photos and thoughts in the 
comments section of Lucy’s post to 
express their support. 
 
Rackham 
student 
Mario 
Gaviria 
responded to Lucy’s tweet, criticizing 

the University’s lack of support for 
marginalized communities on campus.
“@UMich !?!?” Gaviria wrote. “Y’all 
need to actually do something concrete 
bc all these ‘diversity committees’ and 
‘diversity trainings’ don’t accomplish 
anything other than providing the 
illusion that y’all actually care — when in 
reality you don’t. This is unacceptable.”
Following 
the 
incident, 
Lucy 
posted multiple signs in his hallway 
calling attention to this vandalism 
incident targeting students of Color 
at the University of Michigan. The 
three flyers called out the “ignorance,” 
“privilege” and “racism,” saying each “is 
very much real and … very much lives in 
this hall.”
Shortly after Lucy posted these 

new signs, however, they too were torn 
down and scattered across the floor in 
his hall, which Lucy said he noticed 
Saturday morning. 
“Initially, I was a little hurt, but 
(later) I was more angry and upset and 
hurt,” Lucy said. “It’s 2022, and Black 
people on this campus have been 
experiencing things like this forever. 
It’s sad that we’re still fighting for the 
same things that people were fighting 
for during the first Black Action 
Movement and still asking for respect 
and dignity when that should be 
something that’s given to everybody 
here.”
The Black Action Movement 


Spring commencement is one of the 

busiest times of the year in Ann Arbor 

as large crowds visit town to celebrate 

with the year’s graduating class. For 

the past two years, commencement 

has looked a little different: the 

commencement was canceled in 2020 

and was closed to guests in 2021. 

This year, however, there will be two 

commencement ceremonies, one for 

the class of 2022 on April 30 and a 

special “Comeback Ceremony” for the 

class of 2020 on May 7.

Ann Arbor businesses typically rely 

on spring commencement as a way 

to drive in large amounts of traffic 

before students leave and foot traffic 

slows down. The cancellation of the 

2020 commencement ceremony and 

the pared-down 2021 commencement 

ceremony to graduates has put a strain 

on Ann Arbor businesses already 

trying to stay afloat.

For businesses like Ashley’s Bar & 

Grill on State Street, graduation leads 

to an increase in turnout. Ashley’s 

owner Jeff More said he expects a 

steady increase as individual schools 

and colleges within the University 

of 
Michigan 
have 
their 
own 

commencement ceremonies.

“It’s 
not 
just 
the 
Saturday 

commencement,” More said. “There’s 

different colleges. So they’re utilizing 

Hill Auditorium for an awful lot for 

different college commencements as 

well. (Ashley’s Bar & Grill) being right 

across from (Hill Auditorium) we see 

so much (business) throughout the 

week.”

Lauren Bloom, owner of Bløm 

Meadworks, a local mead and cider 

company located on Fourth Ave, 

said her business does not typically 

surge after commencement. Rather, 

restaurants and other food or drink 

related businesses in the city become 

the main attraction as families celebrate 

with a meal. 

“We see kind of an overall general 

increase in business, but it doesn’t end 

up being this huge surge,” Bloom said. 

“What we’ve found in the past is that the 

real spike in business tends to mostly hit 

restaurants in Ann Arbor because most 

people are looking to go out with their 

family, get a meal and sit down for a 

while.”

Lisa Bee, co-founder of Sweetwaters 

Coffee & Tea, which has seven 

locations 
throughout 
Ann 
Arbor, 

said quick service businesses are 

expecting demand to increase around 

commencement for a quick bite to eat 

or drink.

“It’s a mix of both (taking out and 

dining) in and then if it’s a nice day, they 

usually want to walk around … but if (it is 

not a nice day), then they’ll come in and 

sit down,” Bee said. “So we definitely see 

a lot more of the seats filled. Especially if 

it’s a nice day, then they’re sitting outside 

and this year, we’re going to have the 

street area closed off so the patio seating 

will be a lot bigger.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the city of Ann Arbor expanded 

permits for patio seating, the city closed 

specific streets on the weekends during 

the pandemic to allow for increased 

outdoor seating. The city is continuing 

the program this summer after citizens 

spoke out in support of al fresco dining. 

More said he plans to reopen Ashley’s 

patio once the weather improves.

“During (the winter of 2021), we kept 

our little bit of outdoor seating, like six 

tables, open all last winter,” More said. 

“And we had a lot of 50 degree days on 

a Saturday and, you’d turn the heaters 

on and every table would be full all day 

long, even though we’re otherwise shut 

down.”

While Bløm does not usually 

receive large surges of business at 

commencement, 
Bloom 
said 
she 

is overstaffing her restaurant for 

the weekend to prepare for more 

customers.

“We usually ask one or two extra 

staff members to come on for the 

weekend,” Bloom said. “That usually 

tends to be a good balance of being 

prepared and making sure that we can 

see people quickly and serve people 

quickly.”

LSA freshman Daniel Silva works at 

Bert’s Cafe inside the Shapiro Library. 

Silva said he has been asked to pick 

up more shifts during the graduation 

season. 

This additional demand for shifts 

is not solely a result of graduation. 

Throughout the pandemic, businesses 

have reported having a harder time 

finding workers.

For businesses with fewer workers, 

there is additional strain on workers. 

Silva said this extra demand is even 

more stressful for full-time students. 

“I have the pressure of, ‘Oh, we 

need a shift covered,’” Silva said. “It’s 

just worse because you want to catch 

up, do your work, study for that exam, 

but also, you don’t want to let down 

your coworkers that you get so close 

with, and you become actual friends 

with.”

Preparation for graduation goes 

beyond simply adding more staff, 

however. Bee said Sweetwaters is also 

adding additional merchandise and 

menu items to prepare for the influx 

of customers.

“We’ll bring in more desserts, more 

treat items, celebratory items,” Bee 

said. “Students who are graduating 

usually want to take something with 

them. And because we’ve been in Ann 

Arbor for such a long time, and there’s 

multiple locations in Ann Arbor, they 

usually want to take a little piece with 

them whether it’s like a Sweetwaters 

t-shirt, or something like that.”

 Restaurants, companies say they expect higher demands, will increase staffing in coming weeks 

Downtown Ann Arbor District Library 
installs free Narcan vending machine

RILEY HODDER
Daily Staff Reporter

 Home of New Vision leads effort to support individuals with substance abuse disorders

A new vending machine now 

stands outside the Ann Arbor 

District Library that dispenses 

free 
Narcan, 
the 
brand-name 

version of the overdose-reversing 

drug naloxone, according to an 

April 1 tweet from AADL Director 

Eli 
Neiburger. 
The 
vending 

machine was installed by Home 

of New Vision, an organization 

devoted to supporting those with 

substance abuse issues.

According to Rackham student 

Derek Frasure, policy director 

for Students for Sensible Drug 

Policy (SSDP) at the University of 

Michigan, the vending machine 

supplies resources that could be 

vital in saving someone’s life.

“(The 
vending 
machine) 
is 

something 
that 
can 
mitigate 

that tide of deaths, which has 

currently outpaced car accidents 

for common fatalities,” Frasure 

said.

Lieutenant Mike Scherba of 

the Ann Arbor Police Department 

(AAPD) said that in 2021, the 

AAPD received a total of 68 calls 

recorded in their system as drug 

overdoses in Ann Arbor, which 

averages out to about one call per 

week. While all AAPD officers 

and supervisors are required to 

carry naloxone, Scherba said the 

vending machine has the potential 

to create faster distribution of 

the drug to those experiencing an 

overdose.

“Provided 
that 
the 
person 

has the ability to administer 

(naloxone) properly, I think the 

potential, at least, is there for 

faster administration,” Scherba 

said. 

Public Policy graduate student 

Alyshia Dyer is a former law 

enforcement 
officer 
for 
the 

Washtenaw 
County 
Sheriff’s 

Office and a member of SSDP. 

Dyer said she has responded to 

many previous 911 calls involving 

an overdose and expressed how 

critical naloxone is in overdose 

situations.

“The times that I’ve used 

naloxone, it really felt like you were 

saving someone’s life, because it 

wasn’t looking good before that,” 

Dyer said. “It showed me how 

important it was to make naloxone 

readily available.”

Dyer 
also 
said 
quick 

administration of naloxone was 

integral to ensuring the recovery of 

the person overdosing, and that by 

making naloxone readily available, 

the community was saving lives.

“I 
have 
done 
research 
on 

opioid response in Michigan, and 

basically, making naloxone widely 

available is one of the best public 

health initiatives that you can do 

to save people’s lives,” Dyer said.

Though the vending machine 

can 
provide 
quicker 
access 

to 
naloxone, 
Scherba 
said 

the primary concern with its 

installment is that it could create 

a false sense of security among 

those 
experiencing 
substance 

abuse.

“(People who are witnessing 

an overdose) may not call for help 

as soon as they could or would 

have 
otherwise, 
which 
could 

potentially put the user at risk,” 

Scherba said.

However, 
Brianna 
Dobbs, 

Recovery 
Opioid 
Overdose 

Team coordinator for Home of 

New Vision and coordinator for 

the vending machine project, 

expressed 
that 
the 
vending 

machine will help beyond just 

saving lives.

“Having (the vending machine) 

in such a public place will raise 

awareness, reduce barriers and 

increase access to a life-saving 

medication,” Dobbs said.

Dobbs added that Home of 

New Vision is trying to decrease 

the stigma around naloxone, as 

it is not just to be given to those 

experiencing 
substance 
abuse. 

Dobbs 
emphasized 
naloxone 

can also be used in cases when 

prescribed 
medication 
is 

inadvertently 
misadministered. 

She said every household should 

have naloxone in their first aid kit.

“People can have an opioid 

overdose because they took too 

much of a prescription medication, 

they read the bottle wrong or a 

small child gets into someone’s 

medication,” Dobbs said.

As for the future, Home of 

New Vision hopes to expand 

the vending machines to other 

libraries in Washtenaw County. 

Dobbs said they are trying to 

expand these vending machines 

to 
the 
areas 
in 
Washtenaw 

County that experience the most 

overdoses. The organization told 

The Daily that their priority is 

challenging the stigma around 

drug overdoses, and there is still 

more to do.

“I think there’s so much that 

can be done,” Dobbs said. “I think 

the starting point is to provide 

empathy and passion and support 

for people.”

Content Warning: This arti-
cle contains mentions of sexual 
assault.
The University of Michigan’s 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center’s (SAPAC) 
37th annual survivor speak-
out began with a moment of 
silence Sunday night. About 
70 U-M community members 
came together at the Michigan 
Union’s Pendleton Room to 
share and listen to stories from 
sexual assault survivors. The 
crowd fell quiet as attendees 
paid respect to those impact-
ed by sexual assault but were 
unable to attend the speak-out. 
The theme of this year’s 
event was “Metamorphosis.” In 
the spirit of the theme, attend-
ees were invited to write anon-
ymous positive messages and 
affirmations for survivors on 
butterfly-shaped sticky notes 
and attach them to a poster. 
“Thank you for sharing,” one 
note read. “You are so brave 
and I believe you.” 
All 
the 
lights in the 
Pendleton 
Room were 
dim, but the 
space 
was 
aglow 
with 

fairy lights and glow sticks 
held by each of the guests, who 
waved them in support of each 
speaker instead of applauding. 
Speakers 
shared 
poems, 
affirmations 
and 
stories 
addressing their experiences 
with intimate partner violence, 
sexual assault, stalking and 
the long-term impacts of sex-
ual violence on mental health. 
Anonymous submissions were 
also read aloud by SAPAC vol-
unteers. To protect the pri-
vacy of the speakers and at the 
request of event organizers, 
The Michigan Daily will not be 
publishing any quotes shared at 
the event.
In an interview with The 
Daily, LSA senior Thiany Rid-
dihough, 
co-coordinator 
of 
SAPAC’s Survivor Empower-
ment and Ally Support program 
(SEAS), said it was important to 
allow survivors to participate 
in any way they felt comfort-
able.
“I think the real significance 
of this event is allowing survi-
vors 
to 
come 
and 
be 
in 
a 
space 
where they don’t have 
to 
share,” 
Riddihough 

said. “They’re not required to 
do anything, but they can sit 
with people in the community 
they know that feel love for 
them, feel empathy for them, 
and where they can feel com-
fortable to share their story if 
they want.”
Multiple 
attendees 
addressed the emotional trau-
ma that accompanies experi-
ences of sexual violence. They 
described feelings of isolation, 
anger, shame and grief, as well 
as struggles with mental ill-
ness. 
LSA senior Zoe Lainis, co-
coordinator of SEAS, told The 
Daily that creating a safe space 
on campus for survivors to 
verbalize their stories is more 
important than ever.

“It’s just to know you’re not 
alone … on this campus,” Lai-
nis said. “We’ve had a lot of 
issues at this University with 
sexual assault, and so (the 
speak-out) reinforces that you 
are supported.”

The Sikh Student Association 
(SSA) hosted around 100 Uni-
versity of Michigan students and 
community members Sunday 
evening in the William Monroe 
Trotter Multicultural Center to 
celebrate Vaisakhi, a Sikh holiday. 
The event was co-sponsored by 
the Office of Multi-Ethnic Stu-
dent Affairs (MESA), and indi-
viduals of all religious identities 
were encouraged to attend.
The Sikh faith is a monotheis-
tic religion, meaning that follow-
ers of Sikhism only worship one 
God. Equality among all of God’s 
creations regardless of race or 
social standing and the freedom 
to choose and practice religion 
freely are core beliefs in the Sikh 
faith.
Sikh music filled the room 

throughout Sunday’s event, and 
attendees were treated to a tra-
ditional Sikh dinner. The menu 
included cha, mango lassi, samo-
sas, paneer and Gulab Jamun, a 
solid milk-based dessert.
LSA senior Ramneet Chauhan, 
SSA co-chair, said Vaisakhi is a 
multifaceted event for her student 
organization. She said Vaisakhi 
is both religiously and culturally 
significant for those who identify 
as Sikh.
“For Punjabis, this event is a 
Harvest festival, and for Sikhs, it is 
the birth of the Khalsa, which is a 
festival set by Guru Gobind Singh 
in 1699,” Ramneet Chauhan said. 
“Basically, we are celebrating both 
the religious side and the cultural 
sides for this event.”
The SSA members gave a pre-
sentation to the audience about 
the Sikh religion throughout his-
tory and into the present day. Sikh-
ism is currently the fifth-largest 

religion in the world, with about 
25 million followers worldwide. 
Sikhism centers around the idea of 
oneness within humanity, equality 
for all and Seva — the act of selfless 
service and helping others without 
personal gain.
LSA sophomore Gurleen Chau-
han, who will be co-chair of the 
SSA board next year, shared an 
informational presentation about 
the holiday. Every year on April 
13 or 14, Vaisakhi commemorates 
Sikhism becoming a recognized 
faith, Gurleen Chauhan said. Dur-
ing the first Vaisakhi festival, Guru 
Gobind Singh challenged any Sikh 
to give his life for their faith. Five 
men went with him, and when 
they returned, they were made 
immortal by the Guru’s baptism 
ceremony, Gurleen Chauhan said.

4 — Wednesday, April 20, 2022

WHEN I WAS approximately 13 years 
old I wrote a “The Lord of the Rings” fan-
fiction. It never got past three chapters, 
mostly encompassing the moment Merry 
and Pippin are captured by Orcs until the 
rest of the Fellowship find them after The 
Battle of Isengard. It also never saw the 
light of day, and now collects dust in a 42 
page document on my computer titled “Old 
Stories” that makes me sick to my stomach 
every time I open it. And I’m sure the Tolk-
ien Estate would like it to stay there. 
When I logged onto Twitter on March 
7 and saw #Tolkien trending, I enthu-
siastically clicked the hashtag, hoping 
for updates on Amazon Prime’s upcom-
ing “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of 
Power.” What I got was far less desirable: 
“The Estate sure would like to make Tolk-
ien irrelevant to contemporary creative 
and consumer culture” read one tweet. 
“Tolkien estate once again in their grima 
wormtongue era” read another. There were 
hundreds more like this — statements bla-
tantly calling out the Tolkien Estate’s (who 
oversees the rights to the works of J. R. R. 
Tolkien) stance on fanwork surrounding 
“The Lord of the Rings” franchise, which 
had been reworded and brought back to 

light with the website’s relaunch.
Almost every tweet I saw had a screen-
shot or link to the Tolkien Estate’s FAQs 
attached. On fanfiction, they stated, “You 
cannot copy any part of Tolkien’s writ-
ing or images, nor can you create materi-
als which refer to the characters, stories, 
places, events or other elements contained 
in any of Tolkien’s works.” The language 
of the FAQs is a little disturbing — I’ve 
written a lot of fanfiction in my day and, 
as a young teenager, did a lot of research 
around the legality of fanwork just in case 
my writing got me into any trouble. In all 
of that time, I have never seen an author or 
estate crack down so severely on fanwork, 
and it is baffling that the Tolkien Estate, 
the manager of arguably one of the most 
successful literature and film franchises 
of all time, would want so badly to prevent 
its fans from participating in the universe 
that it protects. 
The Tolkien Estate has a long history 
of this sort of behavior. In the 2015 ver-
sion of their FAQs, the question of writ-
ing stories set in Middle-earth was posed. 
The Tolkien Estate’s response was, “The 
short answer is most definitely NO!” The 
2007 version similarly stated, “The sim-
ple answer is NO.” Both answers go on to 
state that, while tempting, the publica-
tion of fanfiction about Tolkien’s works 
is not allowed nor will the Tolkien Estate 

ever allow it on legal grounds. The Daily 
reached out to the Tolkien Estate for com-
ment on their policies, but they did not 
respond.
The truth is that the legality of fanfic-
tion is complicated. Very complicated. 
Fanfiction is technically a derivative work, 
so copyright holders are allowed to sue 
fanfiction writers on the basis of copy-
right infringement. The copyright holder 
just needs proof that the writer copied or 
used the copyrighted work in their fanfic-
tion. This is where fair use comes in: Just 
as fanfiction is a derivative work, it can 
also, in some cases, be defended under fair 
use as a transformative work. If a piece of 
fanfiction follows the original work too 
closely, seeks commercial profit or impacts 
the market of the original work, fair use is 
less likely to be a strong legal argument. 
However, if a work moves far enough away 
from the original and does not profit off of 
its publication, the argument strengthens. 
The legality of fanfiction is still murky and, 
even now, is widely subjective and often 
considered on a case-by-case basis.
Interestingly enough, the Tolkien Estate 
has yet to take any formal legal action 
against fans producing Tolkien-inspired 
writing. There are a few factors to con-
sider when discussing the Estate’s stance 
on fanfiction, and their failure to make 
good on those claims. For one, the Tolkien 

Estate simply is not the law. So long as your 
work does not violate the laws I outlined 
above — and the countless other copyright 
laws I probably don’t know about — then 
the Tolkien Estate cannot stop you from 
writing all the Legolas fanfiction your 
heart desires. Second, takedown notices 
proffered by the Estate do not constitute 
lawsuits. Simply put, the Tolkien Estate 
can’t do much about fanfiction despite 
their proselytizing. 
And even if they did attempt legal action 
against fanfiction writers, the Tolkien 
Estate would be alienating a massive 
chunk of its audience. On Wattpad, search-
ing “Lord of the Rings” yields around 
30,000 results, and “The Hobbit” on AO3 
shows 40,046 works. To remove that mas-
sive amount of material from the internet 
is to remove the expansiveness of Tolkien’s 
worlds and works, and it would only sig-
nal to fans that they are not wanted by the 
Tolkien Estate. See, fanfiction goes beyond 
all the complicated legal jargon — it is a 
crucial element of modern fandom. 
Fanfiction provides both readers and 
writers with several experiences that tra-
ditional publication and literature compa-
nies cannot. It operates as a space in which 
authors can personalize their favorite con-
tent, experiment with diversity and iden-
tity in fictional worlds, hone written skills 
and engage in a collaborative part of the 

internet. The beauty of fanfiction is that it 
is subject to the whims of fans who wish to 
explore their favorite worlds. It allows for 
critical engagement and communal imagi-
nation about what could happen in a text, 
and it encourages readers to delve into the 
stories that inspire them to write. Creating 
fanfiction does not require money or even 
much experience — it only requires a pinch 
of courage and a good deal of imagination.
J. R. R. Tolkien left behind a world that 
has only grown with the times and has 
been passed down through generations to 
land at this exact moment when it is easier 
than ever for writers to engage with their 
favorite texts and share their work. I argue 
that the Tolkien anthology has only flour-
ished and become more well-worn and 
well-crafted with the advent of fanfiction, 
and it seems foolish that the Tolkien Estate 
would actively desire to cut off a medium 
that has helped make the modern Lord 
of the Rings fandom what it is. Of course, 
I am not a member of the Tolkien family, 
nor do I have any claim to “The Lord of 
the Rings” beyond making my roommates 
watch the movies with me, but I find it 
disheartening that the estate would seek 
to destroy meticulously-crafted fanwork 
that functions as a love letter to Tolkien’s 
universe.

HARRY STYLES HAS begun releas-
ing singles from his upcoming third album, 
Harry’s House, starting with an upbeat, ’80s 
inspired song, “As It Was.” The song is an 
obvious step forward for Styles in terms of 
experimenting with a new sound and dig-
ging deeper with his song lyrics. The words 
are melancholic and introspective, disguised 
by a synthy instrumental somewhat remi-
niscent of a-ha’s “Take On Me.” “As It Was” 
broke records within the early hours of its 
release, becoming Spotify’s most-streamed 
single in one day; the music video has already 
amassed almost 50 million views in just over 

a week.
As Styles steps out of his Fine Line era, he 
seems to step into an in-between space. “As It 
Was” is a story of loneliness, of feeling stuck 
between the past and the future. He’s run-
ning around in circles, something quite liter-
ally shown in the music video as he and his 
partner rotate in a circle, not meeting each 
other in the middle until he is all alone by the 
end. Styles acknowledges topics he hasn’t 
taken on in his music before, such as directly 
addressing his somewhat strained relation-
ship with his father in the lyrics “Your daddy 
lives by himself, he just wants to know that 
you’re well.” While Styles has frequently 
discussed the feeling of being lonely in older 
tracks like “From The Dining Table,” this is 
the first time we’ve seen him give direct ref-

erences to his personal life, and it feels like 
he is taking a step towards creating music 
that truly reflects his inner feelings.
Styles is certainly no stranger to using 
sounds inspired by older music and other 
artists, with this song taking inspiration 
from the ’80s to create something haunting-
ly beautiful. The poppy and bouncy instru-
mental perfectly counteracts the sadness 
and longing of the lyrics, creating a song that 
people will sing along to without even real-
izing what they’re saying, à la “Hey Ya.” This 
combination perfectly fits Styles’s public 
perception of just being a heartthrob with a 
good voice, so much so that fans will ignore 
his pleading in the lyrics of “As It Was.” It’s a 
strong track, hopefully suggesting a new and 
exciting direction for Harry’s House. 

One does not simply ‘write’ Lord of the Rings fanfiction

‘As It Was’ marks a new era for Harry Styles
Emily Henry’s newest 
romance is the dream for all 
‘Book Lovers’

BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS are 
like the main character of a 
movie saying “my life is so not 
a movie” — they’re oddly self-
aware and reassuring. You meet 
characters who also love the 
musty smell of libraries and 
appreciate the rush of purchas-
ing a new book. Emily Henry’s 
newest contemporary romance 
“Book Lovers” is exactly what 
its title suggests — it’s a book 
about book lovers talking about 
books like it’s their job (hint: it 
is).
At the beginning of the story, 
Nora Stephens meets Charlie 
Lastra, and the two don’t exact-
ly hit it off. She’s a no-non-
sense literary agent and he’s a 
brooding book editor, but their 
potential working relationship 
immediately turns sour the 
moment Charlie says he isn’t 
interested in editing Nora’s 
favorite client’s book, “Once in 
a Lifetime.” Much to Charlie’s 
dismay, the book becomes a 
bestseller two years later.
When Nora’s younger and 
very pregnant sister, Libby, 
convinces her to take a much-
needed girls’ trip, the two trav-
el to the small town of Sunshine 
Falls, the setting of “Once in a 
Lifetime,” for a month. Inspired 
by the book, Libby comes up 
with a vacation bucket list 
to ensure the two have their 
own life-changing small-town 
adventure. Nora’s plan to lie low 
and enjoy her vacation is ruined 
when she bumps into Charlie — 
again and again. As if Sunshine 
Falls wasn’t small enough, they 
are thrown together to work on 
her client’s new book, but Nora 
can’t ignore the biggest plot 
twist yet: she and Charlie actu-
ally work well together. Just as 
Nora and Charlie grapple with 
their connection in a new set-
ting, they begin to wonder if 
their relationship will survive 
back home in New York. Does 
what happens in a small town 
stay in a small town? 
It should come to the sur-
prise of no one that “Book 
Lovers” was considered one 
of the most anticipated books 
of 2022 by pretty much every-
body, myself included. As the 
New York Times bestselling 
author of young adult and adult 
romance novels, Emily Henry is 

the queen of fun and emotional 
summer reads, and “Book Lov-
ers” is no exception. 
“Book Lovers” is an ode 
to the Miranda Priestlys and 
Meredith Blakes of the world. 
You know, the Ice Queens and 
career-driven women we love 
to hate in pop culture. Nora fits 
this archetype: At work, she’s 
known as the Shark, and she 
hasn’t cried in 10 years. How-
ever, instead of villainizing her, 
Henry gives us a well-crafted 
and 
sympathetic 
character. 
Nora is incredibly sarcastic, 
which makes her first-person 
narrative enjoyable and her 
millennial-esque quirks (a.k.a. 
being obsessed with her Pelo-
ton) not that annoying. Nora 
knows she’s not the heroine of 
her own story — she’s success-
ful but overly committed to her 
job, and she puts the needs of 
others, specifically Libby and 
her clients, before her own. She 
usually dates workaholic guys 
just like her, until it inevita-
bly doesn’t work out and those 
exes go on to marry Nora’s 
complete opposites. But that 
all changes when Nora gets to 
know Charlie. Nora and Charlie 
understand each other because 
they’re both competitive within 
the literary world and they’re 
both New York City people until 
they die. 
The 
trickiest 
part 
about 
incorporating the “rivals-to-
lovers” trope is the transition 
from the characters hating 
each other’s guts to enjoying 
the other’s presence, but Hen-
ry’s execution is seamless. The 
animosity between Nora and 
Charlie quickly fades, but the 
chemistry and impeccable ban-
ter is constant throughout the 
story. You can’t help but say 
“Oh my god” after every single 
scene involving Nora and Char-
lie. From the start, their con-
nection is obvious; but as the 
story progresses, their romance 
flourishes. Filled with scenes 
of intimacy (in every sense 
of the word), their romance 
is inspired. Charlie is always 
quick to remind Nora that he 
wants her to have everything 
she’s ever dreamed of. It’s such 
a simple-sounding notion, yet I 
can’t help but wonder if that is 
what we can only hope for in 
our romantic pursuits.

Meet Annie Rauwerda, the U-M student behind Depths of Wikipedia

Why I can’t (and won’t) shut up about season 2 of ‘Bridgerton’

MAYBE YOU’VE SCROLLED through 
your timeline on your favorite social 
media app and come across a post about 
odd Canadian traditions, animal-shaped 
breads or ancient Sumerian jokes — but 
did you know that the creator of these 
posts could’ve been in your discussion 
section?
In April 2020, then-LSA sophomore 
Annie Rauwerda was in the same place as 
many Wolverines: stuck at home, bored 
and chronically online. From the corner 
of Ann Street and Glen Avenue, Rauw-
erda started her “quarantine project” and 
posted for the first time on her new Insta-
gram account @depthsofwikipedia. Flash 
forward to now, and that same account 
has upwards of 800,000 followers split 
across Instagram, TikTok and Twitter. 
Since that first post, the essentials of the 
account have remained the same: Rau-
werda curates snippets from the crowd-
sourced Wikipedia — whether they’re 
silly, weird, outrageous or all of the above 
— and shares them with the world.
Rauwerda’s post about recursive islands 
and lakes includes the phrases “islands in 

lakes on islands in lakes” and “lakes on 
islands in lakes on islands.” There’s also 
Diego the tortoise, whose Wikipedia page 
boasts that “Diego has been said to have 
‘had so much sex he saved his species.’” 
My personal favorite is her spotlight on 
Hanlon’s razor, the old adage stating 
“never attribute to malice that which is 
adequately explained by stupidity.” I think 
about that one a lot. 
Her success has been think-pieced into 
the next dimension: The New York Times 
calls it an “entry point to internet culture,” 
Mashable praises Depths of Wikipedia for 
its bizarre trivia lessons and Vice describes 
its significance among Gen Z with fancy 
words like “post-irony” and “meta-irony.” 
Rauwerda sells merchandise too (with 
the proceeds going to Wikipedia), hosts a 
Depths of Wikipedia Discord channel and 
regularly interacts with her ever-growing 
community of Wiki-lovers.
But none of that is what we’re here for. 
It’s finally time to address one glaring 
truth: Rauwerda is a U-M Neuroscience 
major, one whose celebrity seems largely 
unknown among the student body. The 
Michigan Daily is adding to Rauwerda’s 
long roster of interviews to glean a sense 
of what it’s like to get your degree in Ann 
Arbor while navigating much bigger 

things. The interview has been edited for 
clarity and context.
The Michigan Daily: How do you 
explain Depths of Wikipedia to someone 
who hasn’t heard of it?
Annie Rauwerda: If I just need to say 
something quick, I would probably just 
call it a meme page. I don’t think it’s real-
ly memes, though — I’m not adding text 
to images. So if people ask for an actual 
explanation, I say it’s Wikipedia screen-
shots I find funny or interesting. Some-
times I feel like people that are older don’t 
get it — they don’t seem to understand the 
whole gimmick account concept.
TMD: You must get a lot of direct mes-
sages and suggestions for what to post. 
How do you sort through them all? 
AR: I get a lot of DMs lately. It used to 
be very manageable; I used to either post 
every Wikipedia page that someone sub-
mitted, or give a very thoughtful response 
on why I wasn’t going to. But now I don’t. 
I make an effort to read at least every mes-
sage, but sometimes I can’t even do that. 
When I post a lot of stories and I start get-
ting story responses, then it gets to be a 
lot. It’s so nice because all these people are 
usually sending really sweet and thought-
ful things. I definitely try to acknowledge 
them, maybe like the message, but unfor-

tunately, I just don’t have enough time 
and diligence to send something heartfelt 
back to everyone. The majority of DMs are 
probably people saying, “Oh, you should 
definitely post about this,” and you would 
not believe how many repeats there are. At 
this point, I’ve posted something like 700 
different things, and so many of the things 
people submit are things that I’ve already 
posted. But then other times people will 
send things that are really interesting, and 
sometimes I’ll be like “Oh, I gotta save that 
for later.”
TMD: You’re very accessible and 
approachable despite having almost a mil-
lion followers. I see a lot of accounts that 
are similar in popularity, but they don’t 
have regular communication with their 
followers like you do. How do you keep up 
with that? 
AR: The 800,000 of them have so 
much to tell me that would improve the 
account, and also give me ideas for writ-
ing. I’ll kind of subtly try to get inspira-
tion and ask questions like, “what’s a fun 
website you’ve seen lately” or something. 
I’m a part-time student right now taking 
nine credits, so that helps too. I think of 
Depths of Wikipedia as my social life in 
some ways. When I go on Instagram live, 
that’s just me being like, “Oh, haha! I’ll go 

talk to this piece of glass that feels like my 
friends.” I think it’s very fun. Also, people 
are so nice to me; I know some people on 
the internet have really toxic experiences, 
but I think probably only one in 10,000 
interactions I have aren’t positive. 
TMD: In a lot of your interviews, you 
mention editing for Wikipedia. Can you 
explain how that works? If I wanted to 
edit for Wikipedia, how would I do it?
AR: Overall, the process is very easy. 
First, you would make an account, and 
then press the little pencil icon on an 
article. There are some pages for more 
controversial issues, like the 2022 Rus-
sian invasion of Ukraine or abortion, that 
are often vandalized. For those pages, 
you would have to have an account for a 
certain amount of time and have made a 
certain number of good edits before you’re 
allowed to edit them. I think that a lot of 
new editors will go in feeling unsure of 
what to edit, because that’s what I felt at 
first; I fixed one typo at a time and felt like 
there was nothing else to do. 
In reality, though, there’s so many 
pages that are just kind of “meh.” Right 
now, a lot of obscure pages are just really 
poorly written or have outdated sources, 

WHEN THE FIRST season of 
“Bridgerton” came out, I refused to 
watch it. To me, it seemed like another 
romantic period drama that would try 
and fail to live up to “Pride and Preju-
dice.” After the initial hype died down, 
I forgot about it. Until, of course, the 
second season was released. The first 
things I saw were the stills — and my 
jaw dropped. 
For the first time, I was seeing true 
South Asian representation in a period 
piece. I saw images of Kate (Simone 
Ashley, “Sex Education”) and Edwina 
Sharma (Charithra Chandran, “Alex 
Rider”) decked out in some of the most 
beautiful outfits I had ever seen. The 
colors complimented them wonder-
fully, and the jewelry was a subtle 
yet meaningful nod to the characters’ 
Indian heritage. Seeing Edwina Shar-
ma wearing her jhumka (classic bell-
shaped earrings) was enough to propel 
me to hit play on the series.
In case you haven’t succumbed to 
the whirlwind hype that is the second 
season of “Bridgerton,” here’s a basic 
rundown: Viscount Anthony Bridger-
ton (Jonathan Bailey, “Broadchurch”), 
eldest of the eight Bridgerton siblings 
and heir to the estate, has decided he 
will finally settle down and marry. 
Adamant on keeping love out of his 
marriage and simply seeking a suitable 
bride, Anthony sets his sights on the 
diamond of the season: Miss Edwina 

Sharma, who has arrived from India 
with her older sister Kate and mother, 
Mary (Shelley Conn, “Good Omens”). 
Kate proves to be a formidable obsta-
cle in Anthony’s courtship of her sis-
ter, but it soon becomes clear that the 
Kate and Anthony have a closer bond 
than either of them could have imag-

ined.
The “enemies to lovers” trope is 
no doubt perfectly executed, and it’s 
something that viewers (including 
myself) have been absolutely eating 
up. But it wasn’t the story that made 
this season so great to me. It was the 
representation. I know the phrase 
“representation is important” has 
been thrown around often recently, 

but I can’t stress how true it is. Think 
about the South Asian representation 
in most shows and movies. How are 
we characterized? Weird. Nerdy. Awk-
ward. Ugly. While most of us can agree 
that we’ve happily left the “Baljeet” 
and “Ravi” stereotypes behind, it 
hasn’t necessarily gotten much bet-

ter. Shows like “Never Have I Ever” 
and “The Sex Lives of College Girls” 
have South Asian girls at the forefront 
yet somehow still manage to play into 
those damaging stereotypes. Exhibit 
A: Bela’s comment in “The Sex Lives of 
College Girls” about how she used to be 
an “Indian loser with sweaty armpits, 
cystic acne and glasses,” but medically 
fixing all of that made her “normal.” 

I’m sorry, does “normalcy” not include 
the Indian part? And don’t even get me 
started on the general unlikeability of 
Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, “Turn-
ing Red”) in “Never Have I Ever.”
“Bridgerton” blazed a new path 
for good South Asian representation. 
The Sharmas are Indian through and 
through, but that’s not all they are. 
Their ethnicity is an asset, not a liabil-
ity. Their culture was embraced in the 
most graceful way possible. The first 
words out of Kate Sharma’s mouth in 
the entire season are “Oh baap re,” a 
Hindi phrase roughly translated to 
“oh my god.” It only gets better from 
there.
As a South Indian myself, I have 
always referred to my mom and dad 
as “Amma” and “Appa” — something 
I used to feel uncomfortable doing 
in elementary school growing up 
with peers who used the more famil-
iar English terms. So it goes without 
saying that I couldn’t help but smile 
when Kate referred to her parents as 
“Amma” and “Appa.” When I watched 
Kate apply oil to her younger sister’s 
hair, I know I don’t just speak for 
myself when I say that I thought about 
my own mother and grandmother lov-
ingly doing the same for me. Every 
time Edwina affectionately calls Kate 
“Didi” (‘elder sister’ in Hindi) or Kate 
calls Edwina “Bon” (‘sister’ in Benga-
li), viewers are reminded of who these 
characters are at their core and where 
their love for each other comes from. 
It was certainly the little things, 
like the instrumental version of the 

Bollywood song “Kabhi Khushi Kab-
hie Gham” playing in the background 
of the Sharmas’ pre-wedding haldi 
ceremony that made me and my room-
mates smile ear to ear. Looking back 
now, however, I can pinpoint with 
much more accuracy the deeper rea-
son I enjoyed the representation in 
“Bridgerton.” In not addressing the 
stereotypes that have previously sur-
rounded Indian characters in media, 
Shonda Rhimes actually did address 
them. Kate and Edwina’s beauty was 
never seen as surprising. Their culture 
was never odd or exotic. Their Indian 
accents were realistic and charming. 
Neither of them were beautiful “for an 
Indian girl” — a phrase I have heard 
far too many times. They were simply 
beautiful and deserving of the same 
passionate love that everyone else 
was. When Anthony called Kate by her 
full, ethnic name, my heart absolutely 
melted. In calling her “Kathani Shar-
ma,” Anthony acknowledged who Kate 
was, and showed her that he loved 
every part of her. 
Did “Bridgerton” make me miss 
my Amma’s oil head massages? Yes. 
Did it have me contemplating how to 
wear jhumka with every outfit? Also 
yes. But as I sit here writing this piece 
while listening to the instrumental 
“Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,” I real-
ize that it did so much more for me and 
for every South Asian girl that was left 
breathless after this season. It showed 
me that people like me have a place 
everywhere, that everyone deserves a 
“Kanthony” type of love.

Student Filmmakers: Cassidy Caulkins, Victoria Huang and Monica Iyer

The Daily Arts film beat offers insightful 
analysis of films of all genres. Nevertheless, 
there has been a lack of attention given to 
the many talented and passionate filmmak-
ers who surround us here, at the University 
of Michigan. I started this series to high-
light their work, their unique visions of film 
and the obstacles they face as student film-
makers.
“LET’S IMPROV.”
“YOU just start talking and I’ll type.”
This is what LSA seniors Cassidy 
Caulkins and Monica Iyer do when the 
words aren’t flowing. Sometimes a real 
exchange between them will generate 
better dialogue than thinking about it 
could. Even the dialogue that the screen-
writing pair don’t find through speaking 
is often tested this way, each taking the 
role of a character and seeing if the lines 
they’ve written work. They write togeth-
er, sometimes taking turns to type, in cof-
fee shops around the U-M campus or in 
one of their bedrooms in the apartment 
they share with six roommates.
In an interview with The Michigan 
Daily, Caulkins described their writing 
process of meeting for several-hour ses-
sions to draft and edit their scripts.
“There has been a time or two when it 
might be a later night and it might involve 
some wine,” she said. “Not every time, but 
that is a part of the process.”
Since summer 2021, Caulkins and Iyer 
have collaborated to write a pilot for 
a sitcom titled “More Than a Degree” 
and a short film, “Disparate.” They have 
joined forces with other students to take 
their words to the screen, among them 
“Disparate”’s 
co-producer 
and 
Ross 
senior Victoria Huang, who was also pres-
ent for the interview.
Of the three, only Caulkins is a film 
major. Involved in theatre costume design 
in high school, she tried to transition to 
costuming for film upon reaching college, 
but was faced with the disappointment 

that most student film productions don’t 
focus much on costumes. She has since 
become more open to other parts of film 
production, “opening my perspective on 
what I would enjoy” — but costuming will 
always be considered in her own projects. 
“You can tell a lot about a character by 
(what they wear),” she said.
Iyer is a biopsychology major, but she 
took up acting in college and joined writ-
ing forces with Caulkins to take the advice 
to write her own material. Her excitement 
over their projects is infectious. She keeps 
a running list of funny things that happen 
in her and Caulkins’s apartment for use 
in future “More Than a Degree” episodes 
and, with post-college plans that veer 
away from the film world, regularly men-
tions how sad it is that this might be the 
last time they work together.
And then there is Huang, who is study-
ing business with a global media studies 
minor and appears to be the organized 
one. She has found her place in the arts 
as a coordinator, not filming or acting, 
but bringing people together where their 
visions can become something real. She 
worked as head of costuming at her high 
school theatre company and as a produc-
tion assistant for Musket, the University’s 
student acting organization, her sopho-
more year, where Iyer was also an actor. 
She is the first to admit that her business 
classes lack the creativity she craves, 
which she has tried to find in these film 
productions.
From disparate backgrounds, the three 
have found each other from chance friend-
ships founded on this shared need for a 
creative outlet and love of film, despite 
the different forms it takes for each. All 
seniors with vastly different paths ahead 
of them, their time as a filmmaking trio is 
short — a momentary merging of inspira-
tion and creativity.
Their year of working together began 
at the end of the summer when Caulkins 
and Iyer wrote the pilot for “More Than 
a Degree,” inspired by their own house: 
five friends live together, close-knit but 
not without their differences, and drama 

and hilarity ensue. Iyer compares it to 
“New Girl,” but rather than centering on 
a quirky and awkward 31-year-old, it aims 
to capture “that transition from college 
to post-graduate life.” They asked Huang 
to join them as producer and began cast-
ing and crew calls in September for the 
pilot episode about a birthday party gone 
wrong, which quickly overtook their 
semesters with long days of shooting 
nearly every weekend through November. 
Their goal to finish the episode by Feb-
ruary has not been realized. At the time 
of the interview, it was nearly April and 
Huang had just received the rough cut 
from their editor.
As they entered their final semester of 
college, Caulkins and Iyer’s regular meet-
ings to discuss their pilot morphed into 
meetings about the possibility of a new 
project: one final film together before 
graduation. With little time, the planning 
of this film, now “Disparate,” was shaped 
by its limitations: What story could they 
tell effectively in 10 minutes, with a small 
cast and which they could feasibly com-
plete in a single semester? The script for 
the story of two high school friends enter-
ing college and discovering they are no 
longer compatible was still going through 
final revisions at the time of the interview, 
even as they planned to start shooting the 
following weekend. Huang joined them 
again as co-producer, Caulkins is direct-
ing and Iyer is co-producing and acting as 
one of the main two roles.
The group’s stories typically reach for 
relatability with their audience and are 
often influenced, if not inspired by per-
sonal experiences.
Of “Disparate,” Caulkins said, “I 
couldn’t say (the experience is) univer-
sal,” but by the end of high school, many 
friends “realize they’re going in separate 
directions.”
Their director of photography, LSA 
sophomore Adela Papiez, as well as many 
people who auditioned, told them they 
experienced this, which encouraged them 
to believe they were creating something 
that could touch many viewers.

Besides Caulkins, Iyer, Huang and 
Papiez, their crew includes sound opera-
tor (“slash anything else we need,” Iyer 
laughed) and LSA senior Jacob Gutting, 
actor and SMTD junior Olivia Sinnott 
and Caulkins’s mother, who is playing the 
“adult” the film requires. It is more dif-
ficult to find people for the crew, accord-
ing to Huang, so they kept their numbers 
small and worked with members of the 
crew from “More Than a Degree.” Iyer 
believes the number of student produc-
tions happening this semester is partly 
responsible for the lack of available people 
interested in joining a film crew — they 
are already part of different films. Find-
ing people for the cast was easier. Huang 

emailed their casting call to various Uni-
versity listservs, including that of the 
Film, Television and Media department.
Casting was easier in some ways, as 
many people auditioned. On the other 
hand, while the crew had already bonded 
from their previous production, the actors 
posed the difficulty of choosing a stranger 
with whom they could work well. Accord-
ing to Caulkins, they learned when cast-
ing their TV pilot how important it is for 
actors to be able to take direction well.

“They could deliver exactly what we 
were looking for within the first couple 
lines we gave them,” she said, but then 
wouldn’t do anything different with the 
performance, which lead to material they 
didn’t want to use.
During auditions for “Disparate,” they 
asked actors to change their performance 
in some way, even if it wasn’t in a way they 
planned to ask for during production, 
“just to see that they can exercise that 
muscle and are willing to try something 
new,” said Caulkins. Besides this ability, 
they looked, of course, to see which actors 
reflected the characters in a believable 
way and brought the necessary emotion 
to their auditions.

They chose Sinnott to star opposite Iyer 
in part because of her ability to hold the 
“duality” of the character she played, who 
is meant to be “bubbly and nonchalant” at 
first, but becomes more emotional toward 
the end of the film. They held auditions 
for both leading roles, despite knowing 
Iyer would be cast in one of them, before 
ultimately deciding she had to be a spe-
cific character.

The sweet, warm scent of pollen 
is not the only thing that fills the air 
on campus during April. Along with 
its arrival comes end-of-school-
year stress, fears over what to do 
after the semester ends and the 
dreaded backpacking season. 
After reflecting on the fall 
semester during course selection, 
I realized that I felt empty from 
a lack of music in my life. While I 
enjoyed the one-credit chamber 
music class I was taking and felt 
grateful for the opportunity to play 
my clarinet with others even just 
one day a week, I missed the three-
plus hours I would spend on music 
each day in high school.
It felt like my desire to have 
more music in my life was seeping 
out of me. My fingers would tap 
restlessly, longing for the repetition 
of practicing a challenging run on 
the clarinet over and over again. I 
missed being immersed in a single 
four-beat measure, playing the 
scale it was based in, switching 
up the rhythm and trying to trick 
myself into making a mistake — 
until the pads of my fingers knew 
only the right motion. I missed 
the pulsating feeling in my lower 
lip after a long practice session, a 
reminder that I’m alive and I get to 
create. 
While I had no intentions of 
pursuing a major or minor in music, 
I felt empty without having several 
hours of music in my day. After 
feeling like part of my identity was 
missing, I joined the University 
Band and an a cappella group 
second semester, and found others 
who share the same sentiment. 
Indeed, there are many students 
in different colleges across campus 
who dedicate much of their time 
to music — who feel that it is such 
an intrinsic part of their identity 
they cannot let go of — but who’ve 

decided against majoring in it. 
Some of these people grew up 
always being around music, while 
others stepped into their musical 
pursuits when they were drawn 
in by the welcoming community. I 
spoke with students who connected 
their craft with their studies of 
technology and politics, and who 
have found a bit of home in the 
music scene at the University of 
Michigan.
***
Freshman Michael West is a 
member of the Marching Band, the 
Basketball Band and the University 
Band, and he plays the trombone 
and euphonium — all while being 
a computer science major in the 
College of Engineering. 
In terms of comparing the 
amount of time he spends on school 
versus his music extracurriculars, 
he explained, “Last semester when 
marching band was happening, 
I’d say it was probably 50:50, with 
the time load of marching band 
compared with … the homework for 
the coding class I was in.” 
“I’d say right now, because I’m 
a freshman and my schedule is 
basically just core engineering 
classes that aren’t CS specific, I’m 
spending more time doing music,” 
West said.
For students like West, their 
passion for music and their non-
music major are not isolated, but 
rather, they complement each 
other. They bridge the gap between 
their studies and the music that is 
intrinsic to their identity.
“My Engineering 100 section 
is called Music Signal Processing. 
Our final project is to build a music 
app based off of what we’ve learned 
in the class. And it’s all about like 
learning the physics and the coding 
behind music,” West explained.
West told me about research 
currently 
being 
conducted 
at 
the University that connects the 
fields of music and engineering 

with machine learning models 
that create computer-generated 
chorales:
“Basically you give a computer … 
a bunch of chorales, and in that case 
it would spit out its own chorale 
in that style. It learns the rules 
and patterns by itself and tries to 
recreate that or something similar.” 
Claire Arp, an LSA sophomore 
majoring 
in 
economics 
with 
an intended minor in Native 
American studies, plays several 
dozen instruments as an auxiliary 
percussionist and a guitarist. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
conversation, Arp proudly showed 
me her recent purchase. 
“It is a Squier Stratocaster.”
She held up a shiny electric 
guitar, turning it so I could see the 
instrument from all angles. 
“It’s very pretty … if I was given 
the choice to save it or my own life, 
I would have to think about it for a 
little bit.”
Arp, whose main interests are 
political advocacy and policy, also 
found little dissonance between 
her musical passion and her non-
music major. She noted the parallels 
in how she approaches her study 
of music and of politics, and the 
similarities between the fields. 
“The way that I have learned 
how to do music is mostly through 
finding some type of music that I 
really enjoy, some song or album 
or artist that I really like, and just 
absorbing that and figuring out 
what they are doing in particular. 
And that is what I started doing 
with 
politics 
— 
I’m 
finding 
political figures and advocates and 
commentators that I like ... and kind 
of absorbing how they do things,” 
Arp said. 
These kinds of modeling, intense 
observation skills and desire to pull 
things apart and find meaning, 
works across disciplines. 
In my own statistics class, 
I’ve noticed that the process of 

writing code for a graph is just 
like working through a fast run 
on the clarinet. When I’m coding 
a graph, I start by cleaning the 
data, adding rudimentary labels to 
my variables and filtering out the 
ones I don’t want, along with any 
responses where the answer was 
“N/A.” Once the data set is cleaned, 
I write \n in my labs() command to 
give myself a symmetrical title, use 
stat_smooth() to make the graph 
less noisy and change my colors 
to make it as visually pleasing and 
easy to interpret as possible. 
I work through the same steps 
when practicing the clarinet: I 
first have to go through the basic 
motions of learning the notes and 
counting out the rhythm so that 
I can play it cleanly. But then it’s 
on to smaller elements. I have 
to make sure that the frenetic 
movement of my fingers does not 
get sloppy and allow for a listener 
to hear the metal keys hitting the 
wood joints. And I make sure that 
I don’t change my embouchure 
and air speed as I meander above 
and below the register. Just like 
I might experiment with geom_
violin or geom_bar commands to 
see how my data looks on different 
types of graphs, I try out alternate 
fingerings that give me a smoother 
sound. It is the practice of focusing 
on these small elements that makes 
all the difference. 
Fitting in 
When I came to campus, I quickly 
became aware of the stereotypes 
surrounding each major — of what 
it meant to be a business major 
or an engineer, a math major or a 
musical-theater student. 
When thinking about what to 
study, I considered the associations 
people have with each major and 
whether I fit into them. 
A fun and notably accurate 
example of these characterizations 
is found on the Instagram meme 
account @cccb_umich. The page 

takes 
characters 
from 
“Peppa 
Pig,” “Mean Girls,” “Monsters 
University” and “Sesame Street” 
and assigns them to a major that fits 
their personality and overall vibe. 
I 
enjoy 
scrolling 
through 
these posts and seeing if I or the 
people I know are similar to these 
characters. After all, Peppa is 
undeniably film, Janis Ian is clearly 
sociology and of course, Big Bird, 
with his curiosity and big smile, is 
environmental science.
But beyond these light-hearted 
categorizations of students based 
on their interests are harmful 
preconceptions. 
Trying 
to 
encompass all of the personalities 
and layered interests of people in 
each major into one archetype can 
make people feel that the major 
isn’t for them. 
But majors and the labels they 
come with don’t necessarily box 
people in. For some people, the 
opposite is true. 
Quinn Newman, a sophomore 
majoring in RC drama and film, 
television and media (FTVM) and 
minoring in music, explained that 
their music and theater-oriented 
majors gave them an opportunity to 
lean into their full identity. 
“The 
performing 
arts 
are 
definitely 
a 
very 
safe 
space 
for people who are queer and 
nonbinary like me … I think when I 
started theater and music I had no 
idea what being gay or nonbinary 
was, I was that young and I did not 
have that sort of education. But you 

know, the (theater) community … 
does tend to gear towards a lot of 
people in the LGBTQ community, 
so it’s definitely a place that I feel 
like really allowed to be myself,” 
they said. 
They spoke about a recent 
production in which the structure 
of the roles allowed them to 
perform as their authentic self. 
“As someone who is nonbinary, 
it’s 
definitely 
been 
a 
great 
opportunity here to play roles 
that aren’t necessarily specifically 
gendered ... Recently I played Love 
in the RC Players production of 
‘Everybody,’ and I think almost 
every character in that show 
has no gender, because they are 
all concepts like friendship and 
kinship and love and death so, it 
was such a great and versatile play 
to do because anybody could have 
been cast in any role. And I think 
it was really great to play love as 
myself rather than as a prewritten 
version of love,” Newman said. 
A validating connection between 
oneself and art can form in all sorts 
of spheres, regardless of whether or 
not you happen to be majoring in 
that genre of art. Arp, for example, 
highlighted 
the 
connection 
between her identity as a trans 
woman to hyperpop, a modern style 
of music.
She described hyperpop as “the 
modern autotune track type of

You open up Spotify and start to 
type “feminist” into the search bar. 
Four letters in, and the first two 
playlists that pop up are “feminist 
rage” and “angry feminist music.” 
You watch on live television as 
Lady Gaga says, “I don’t believe 
in the glorification of murder. I 
do believe in the empowerment 
of women.” You scroll through 
YouTube, listening to feminist 
poetry, and notice that nearly every 
woman either starts yelling or 
describes scenes of violence in her 
writing. Halsey does it at the New 
York Women’s March. You watch a 
woman scale the Statue of Liberty 
on TV to protest the separation of 
immigrant families.
If you’re like me, you may see 
these things and begin to notice a 
trend. The women and feminists 
you see on TV and online are often 
portrayed as angry, especially 
when 
fighting 
against 
their 
oppression. Mainstream 
media has fashioned 
our 
21st-century 
feminist to be 
synonymous 
with 
the 
dreaded “angry 
woman” trope.
But if you’re 
like me, you may 
also 

begin to see how feminism is often 
linked with anger, and how rage 
is may actually be pushing the 
movement forward.
The origins behind women’s 
relationship 
with 
anger 
are 
tricky. Oftentimes, women are 
told that anger and its subsequent 
expressions 
are 
“unladylike,” 
while their male counterparts 
are applauded and praised for 
it. It seems like anger is a source 
of power for men, when for me, 
as a woman, I’ve always felt it 
as a weakness: It’s something I 
shouldn’t be feeling, something I 
should be hiding, something that’s 
never gotten me anywhere. Once, 
I got a little heated in a fight with 
a friend, and turned around and 
found that my friends were saying 
I was acting “crazy.” I tried arguing 
with a group of boys my age, once, 
about an issue I was passionate 
about. When I started to get mad, 
they just started to laugh.
I’m not the only one who feels 
this way. In her song “The 
Man,” 
Taylor 
Swift 
adds 
a 
melody to this 
phenomenon 
when 
she 
says, 
“it’s 
okay if you’re 
mad” (only if 
you’re a man). 
Rebecca 
Traister, 

author of “Good and Mad: The 
Revolutionary Power of Women’s 
Anger,” said in an interview with 
C-SPAN that while anger is a 
driving force for male politicians, 
it often hinders female politicians. 
Traister points out that the media 
will often harp on women in power 
(the Hillary Clintons and Michelle 
Obamas) for not smiling or being 
mildly impolite.
Studies have shown that when 
men show anger, they’re applauded 
for it. When women do it, they’re 
shamed, shunned and avoided. 
It’s suggested that, during their 
competing presidential campaigns, 
Donald Trump was allowed to 
be as angry as he wanted, but the 
moment Hillary Clinton slipped 
up, she was crucified.
And yet, anger remains a core 
part of the modern feminist 
movement. In the second wave 
of American feminism, female 
activism was characterized as 
“angry” and “unladylike,” and that 
carried on throughout the other 
three waves of feminism. And yet, 
the movement grew to be even 
more angry in response. Women 
led 
protests 
for 
reproductive 
rights and the Equal Rights 
Amendment. It was likely in this 
early rage that women found their 
power — it was harder to ignore 
them when they were mad. That 
anger still exists now. Since the 
’80s, expressions of feminism and 
female empowerment in media 
are often tied to anger, and 
sometimes the utmost 
culmination of anger: 
violence.
Lady 
Gaga’s 
quote 
says 
enough 
— 
sometimes, 
violence 
in 
movies 
serves 
as 
the 
primary 
expression 
of 
female 
rage 
and 
is 
an 
empowering 
force for female 
characters. Think 
of the plotlines in 
“Gone Girl”, “Kill Bill” 
or “Promising Young Woman” — 

their anger is the narrative arc. 
So 
why 
is 
feminism 
so 
inextricably linked to anger?
I’ve dabbled in poetry, and I’ve 
found that most of my poems find 
their way to an angry place. I’ve 
also found that these pieces are 
some of the hardest for me to share. 
Why? Because I don’t want to be 
seen as angry? Because society has 
taught me that anger isn’t for me, 
because it’s not attractive?
And yet I still get angry. In fact, 
I get angry a lot. I listen to angry 
music, write angry poetry, I scream 
and cry in the mirror. And you 
know what? I’ve found that anger 
is liberating. I feel as if I have been 
told all my life that anger is not for 
me — so reclaiming those feelings I 
have been told not to have has not 
only made me feel better, it has 
made me feel human.
That’s why I think feminism is 
angry. Because feminism is about 
change, but it’s also about making 
women feel better. And guess what 
— anger does that.
The Anger-Cry
When I get angry, I cry. And that 
sucks.
Crying when you’re angry is 
a perfectly reasonable response 
to an emotional situation. Tears 
are supposed to relieve emotions 
when you become overwhelmed 
by them, and anger is not excluded 
from that. And yet, crying when 
you’re angry is one of the hardest 
things to experience because you’re 
effectively undermining yourself. 
In my experience, crying isn’t 
perceived as an expression of anger 
— it’s an expression of weakness, 
of sadness, of vulnerability, which 
isn’t exactly how you always want 
to be perceived when you’re mad. 
And then you get mad at yourself 
because you’re crying, and because 
you’re mad at yourself, you start 
crying even harder. It can be a 
vicious cycle.
But how else would I express my 
anger? By yelling, screaming? I’ve 
never felt confident in that form 
of expression — but why? Why do 
traditional forms of anger feel so 
foreign to me?
The most I can gather is 
because at the origins of women’s 
relationship with anger is the 
systemic 
mistreatment 
and 

pathologizing of women. Female 
expression of anger has historically 
been 
linked 
with 
hysteria, 
forcing angry women into mental 
institutions or undermining their 
concerns. If you think that that was 
a long time ago and is no longer 
prevalent now, might I point out 
that women who express their 
anger now are still labeled as “crazy 
bitches.” Which, again, undermines 
the valid thoughts and feelings that 
push women toward anger.
Soraya 
Chemlay, 
author 
of 
“Rage Becomes Her: The Power 
of Women’s Anger,” claims that 
girls are rarely taught to be angry, 
which rings true to my experience. 
I can’t recall my parents ever 
talking about anger. Sadness, yes, 
happiness, of course, but never 
anger. As Chemaly also claims, 
women are often pushed to find 
out how to express anger through 
watching other people.
But how does one do that? My 
mom was never one to get angry, 
and neither were my grandmas, my 
aunts, my female cousins. I watched 
TV, and only the female characters 
I was supposed to dislike (the 
Regina Georges and the Cruella de 
Vils) ever showed anger, and when 
they did they were labeled as a 
“bitch” or “crazy.”
All this points toward a clash 
between traditional ideas of how 
women should act and how we 
should be expressing our anger. 
Women experience anger, no doubt 
about it, and yet we’re usually not 
taught how to express it. The only 
ways in which women are taught 
to be angry are through the media, 
which 
encourages 
women 
to 
express their anger in unhealthy 
ways.
What might this all culminate 
in? A feeling in most women that 
we can’t be angry, that anger isn’t 
meant for us, that even if we do feel 
it, we must hide it, shove it back 
down our throats, even when it’s 
choking us.
It seems like the modern feminist 
movement has decided it’s time for 
the Heimlich.
Anger as Revolutionary
When women are told that they 
can’t be angry, being angry becomes 
a revolutionary act in and of itself. 
That is why 21st-century feminism 

chooses to recognize anger as 
one of its most valuable weapons. 
There’s something liberating in 
doing something we’ve been told 
to suppress, to freely express our 
emotions to their fullest potential.
I think that’s why so many 
women like myself find comfort 
in angry media. I snap for the 
poet standing on stage, shouting 
about her life experiences. I’ve dug 
through the internet to find better, 
more accurate representations of 
female anger. I watch these women 
and live vicariously through their 
anger. I express my own anger by 
watching, by listening to them. You 
might do that too, and that’s alright.
Chemaly, a prominent feminist 
author, pointed out in an interview 
that anger is just another human 
emotion, and that it doesn’t have 
to be negative unless we make 
it so. When people turn anger 
into real violence, or express it 
negatively, anger pushes us back. 
But when people express their 
anger in healthy ways, through art, 
it can become a powerful tool for 
expression and change.
I think feminism might be doing 
that for women. By providing 
women a space to be angry, the 
movement might just help liberate 
them, or at least make them feel 
better. I know that when I’m 
angry and upset, if I listen to that 
“feminist rage” playlist, or I listen 
to that angry poetry, I feel better. I 
feel seen. I feel like I can brave the 
world, like I’m finally coughing up 
the thing that’s been keeping me 
from breathing.
Maybe you can do that, too. Next 
time you have a bad day, let yourself 
be angry. Next time you feel like 
you’ve been wronged, be angry. 
Don’t let anyone take those feelings 
away from you. Feel what you feel 
and turn it into something useful. 
Write a poem. Draw a picture. Fall 
onto your bed and scream into your 
pillow. Whatever you do, just make 
sure you’re doing one thing: being 
angry. 
Anger is a powerful thing, and so 
are you.

Women are angry: Here’s why

Design by Leilani Baylis-Washington

I first encountered the Kerrytown 
neighborhood when I came to Ann 
Arbor for freshman orientation in 
July of 2018. My partner had driven 
me up to Michigan, and we found a 
current student to stay with for the 
night. The house was a mustard 
color with large curvy windows, 
as if it were inspired by a funhouse. 
It had a huge attic and was shaped 
like no other home I’d ever seen. 
Many of the rooms looked like they 
were closets or huge study spaces 
renovated into bedrooms. Our room 
for the night had a twin sized bed 
with hundreds of theatre posters 
lining on the wall. We had to squish 
together in that bed so as not to 
fall off, and the Ann Arbor air was 
muggy — we immediately wet the 
bed with our sweat, but it was kind 
of fun. It was a little adventure — 

coming to a new town and staying 
in an eclectic house, in an odd little 
room. 
In the morning, I stepped outside 
onto the porch to take a deep breath 
of the Michigan air. A college 
student on a bike flew past while a 
girl in a co-op across the street was 
swinging on a swing. I found the 
scene exhilarating: seeing so much 
commotion in one neighborhood. 
The people who surrounded me at 
that moment seemed grounded, and 
that they might take me in and give 
me a cup of tea. They seemed like the 
kind of people who would take me to 
Burning Man and help me home if I 
found myself in a K-Hole. Although 
the connection was immediate, I 
had no idea that Kerrytown would 
be my home for the next three years 
of my college career.
As a theatre major myself, it was 
natural to live in a house with other 
theatre majors for my sophomore 

year of college. The entire theatre 
department seemed to live in 
Kerrytown, and thus my residence 
began. We moved into the big artsy 
house that I had always longed for: 
there was a huge attic and a very 
spacious basement, perfect for 
playing beer pong or setting up a 
little lounge area. My friends and 
I lived it up in our little residential 
neighborhood. Bands played at 
houses on the weekend, people used 
chalk to draw on the street and yard 
sales with blaring music frequented 
our lawns. It was a happy, wonderful 
environment, and it barely ever 
registered with me that I could be 
living elsewhere, that there was an 
entire other region of campus with 
its own distinct culture.
I came to South Campus for the

Kerrytown versus South Campus: 

Home is where the vibe is

You might just be surprised: 
Locking my phone away for 
three days

I hate my phone. I hate that I 
can’t resist looking at it every time 
it beeps, and I hate how the empty 
seconds of my life are filled with 
screen time. I’m not doing anything 
worthwhile on it — just cluelessly 
scrolling through digital voids that 
are meaningless to me. When I’m on 
my phone, I miss out on everything 
important, I think. 
So in the midst of my anti-phone 
spite, my roommate and I devised a 
plan to put our phones away, all day. 
From 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., we agreed we 
couldn’t have them on our person. 
That meant no Apple Watch, no 
music on the way to class and 
absolutely no way to tune out the 
rest of the world. 
I already carry a virtually 
bare-bones phone on me anyway: 
my Snapchat best friends list is 
empty, my Facebook has long been 
deactivated, Twitter is gone and my 
daily screen time hovers around the 
three or four hour mark. Still, I can’t 
seem to shake its grasp, or the way I 
cling to it when an ad interrupts my 
movie, or my instilled reliance on 
Google-knowing.
One morning, I placed my phone 
into a cranny in my bedroom and I 
headed off to my classes.
It 
was, 
initially, 
less 
than 
pleasant. The walk to my first class 
was boring, but I realized that I paid 
more attention to my surroundings 
(and even enjoyed them more) when 
I didn’t have an AirPod blaring in my 
ear. Uninvited noises became hard 
to ignore, as drills hammered into 
the ground down State Street and 
I became more attuned to the flux 
of cars swirling around me. Yet, I 
was blissfully aware of the more 
mundane things we often take 
for granted, like the synchronized 
melodies of birds in the Diag and the 
chalk sidewalk doodles that sprang 
up overnight.

My 11:30 a.m. class came and 
went generally unaffected, mostly 
because I still insist on taking paper 
notes. Around 1 p.m. I headed off 
to the Modern Languages Building 
to meet with my friend before our 
psychology exam.
Uh-oh. Once I shut my laptop, I 
had no way of constantly updating 
my friend on where I was, nor 
could 
she 
track 
my 
location 
through Find My iPhone. Instead, 
I puttered around the MLB for 
what seemed like five or so minutes, 
and then hesitantly pulled out my 
iPad to send a text. It was wonky 
and inconvenient — my thumbs 
struggling to stretch across the 
oversized screen. But, alas, the job 
was done and I found her. 
I returned home by sunset, and 
my evening was spent lazing on 
the couch with an open textbook 
next to me. Yet, I felt anxious at the 
thought of the clock striking nine 
— I didn’t want my phone, did I? I 
know I didn’t need it, at least not 
then and there. My work for the 
day had been completed, my eyelids 
were struggling to hold their weight 
and I felt no pressing urge to invite 
a technological nuisance back into 
my life. 
In the absence of instant 
gratification, I instead spent 
a whole day immersed in 
my own reality. No 
more 
worrying 
about 
unwanted 
emails 
showing 
up at an 

unfriendly moment, or checking 
the time every two minutes on my 
way to class as I fret showing up 
late. I was in control of everything, 
from what I felt to what I focused 
on. It was intoxicating but it was 
short-lived, and I felt like I had 
failed to test the boundaries of my 
limits: naturally, I extended my 
experiment by three more days.
(Officially) Day 1
9:02 a.m. Just arrived at my first 
class of the day, and when I go to 
open Canvas, I get prompted to send 
a Duo notification. Great. That’s 
fine, I didn’t need to access Canvas 
anyway.
9:56 a.m. Walking across the 
Diag with no headphones is f**king 
weird. Voter registration people 
please don’t come up to me, I am 
busy dissociating.
12:35 p.m. I heard a ring so I 
picked up my phone and it was 
actually a really important phone 
call about my apartment. Please 
don’t hate me, I put it away right 
after — I swear. 
2:13 p.m. So no one was gonna tell 
me it’s literally pouring outside? It’s 
a good thing I carry my umbrella any

8 — Wednesday, April 20, 2022

I’ve been thinking a lot lately on what 
constitutes a friend. The qualifiers and 
the levels all associated with it. What 
distinguishes someone as a true friend 
versus someone you spend time with? 
An issue I had in the past (and still suf-
fer from) is failure to define, creating the 
boundaries between different categories 
of friendship. I consider myself close 
with a lot of people, but am I actually? 
How many can I consider a true friend, a 
partner, a protector of my own interests 
who hold me in the same regard as I hold 
them? 
My friend Eliya sent me a TikTok the 
other day that featured a quote about 
female friendship — that it is a ferocious, 
ugly, messy, emotional creature we are 
never taught to train. My first reaction 
was to laugh, because it’s never that deep. 
Friendships are simple. Easy. It’s roman-
tic love that’s the complicated kind. But 
the quote has rattled in my head as I’ve 
been studying abroad, separate from the 
people I call home.
Sometimes I forget where my best 
friends begin and where I end. Their 
friends are my friends. My belongings 
are their belongings. Their house is my 
house. The lines are blurry to nonexis-
tent at times. No topic is out of bounds. 
We consume each other’s emotions. We 

ruminate over situations, strategizing 
and theorizing in our imaginary situation 
rooms. We tell each other our secrets. 
Our shame. Our burdens. Our pain. Do 
you remember last winter when I held 
you in my arms after you told that boy you 

loved him? I do. The light reflecting off 
your tears, which I had never seen from 
you before. The tremble in your voice as 
you described his rejection. But it’s not 
just the difficult parts that we share. 
We also cheer for each other. Praise one 

another for putting ourselves out there. 
Uplift one another when we feel we might 
have fallen short. And although you were 
shaking, I could not stop thinking how 
strong you are — for taking that risk, for 
being vulnerable. I am proud of you; I 
know you’re proud of me too. I could hear 
it in your voice months later, in the sum-
mer, miles away from one another as you 
cheered me on for going on my first New 
York City date. We give and give and take 
and take and take. 
I am a hopeless romantic. From the 
media I consume to the stories I write 
about, romantic love has always been 
paramount. It’s not like it’s hard to obsess 
over it. Media is saturated with love sto-
ries. Countless books, podcasts, movies, 
TV series and more are all dedicated to 
the pursuit of love and keeping it. My 
favorite TV show used to be “Sex and the 
City.” For months, I watched religiously 
as Carrie chainsmoked her way around 
New York City. You would often join 
me on the couch of our house, holding 
Socratic seminars on Carrie’s shenani-
gans. Would you have gotten back togeth-
er with Big? How could anyone break 
up with Steve? Why do you like Aiden? 
Despite the hours we spent discussing 
the show, we still managed to miss the 
point entirely. The men came and went, 
treated like minor comedic blips, but the 
core four — Carrie, Miranda, Samantha 
and Charlotte — remained, brunching 
and bickering as usual. That’s the true 

love story of the show. Despite whatever 
happened romantically, fans knew as long 
as those friendships were there (ignoring 
the reboot), everything would be fine. 
So do all great love stories have to be 
romantic then? It’s seemingly reinforced 
that romantic love is the only love worthy 
of writing an entire album over or book 
on. But not for me anymore. The friends 
that I’ve made, they’re my big college love 
story. Not one of those random fuck boys 
I keep tripping and falling over for. When 
I look back on this season of my life, I 
won’t think of these minor comedic blips. 

I won’t think of the people I just hap-
pened to spend time with. I’ll think about 
you. I’ll think about the hours we spent 
on the phone, screaming at each other for 
fucking up once again. I’ll think about the 
aimless walks, where we don’t have the 
slightest clue of where we are going. I’ll 
think about the viewing parties, joking 
about Wattpad. I’ll think about the time 
we spent growing and building together. 
It’s messy, ugly, beautiful and everything 
in between. In the longest most convolut-
ed way, I wrote this just to say I miss you. 
I love you. I’ll see you soon.

Author’s Note: I would like to clarify 
my terminology out of respect for the 
gender non-conforming community. 
When I say “men” I am specifically 
referring to cisgender men. When I say 
“women” — I am referring to cisgender 
women, the only identity I can mean-
ingfully speak on. I think it’s important 
to make these distinctions because gen-
der identity is incredibly fluid and we do 
not live in a binary world. We cannot 
keep enforcing such barriers in the lan-
guage we use, which is why it is neces-
sary to clarify what one means when 
they speak so generally. It is oppressive 
by nature to not acknowledge the exis-
tence of identities that do not fit into the 
conventional binary. 
My first sexual revelation as a 
woman happened during my sopho-
more year of high school when I 
stopped wearing bras. It was terri-
fying. I was a flat-chested “skinny” 
girl with chicken legs and everyone 
around me growing up always made 
sure I knew that. I was bullied in mid-
dle school for my body being under 
the standard “healthy” weight and the 

last thing I wanted was for my unflat-
tering legacy to continue into high 
school. To wear the bra or to not wear 
the bra: it was a decision that I went 
back and forth on at least 1,000 times 
and eventually culminated in a split-
second action before I left for school 
that morning. 
When I finally arrived, I took all 
my layers off from being in the harsh 
Chicago winter months. I was just 
a young girl with a black and white 
cubic patterned dress. Exposed for 
the world to see. Except I didn’t want 
to be seen. I was afraid people would 
notice that my chest looked a bit flat-
ter than normal. I went about my day 
going to first period, then to second 
and so on. No one said a word. It felt 
good. Maybe it wasn’t as noticeable as 
I had thought. Maybe I had nothing to 
be ashamed of. I had quickly evolved 
from being afraid to let my natural 
shape show to making a point for it to.
Only one week after I stopped 
wearing bras, I was already so much 
more confident in my body — in 
myself. I started wearing shirts where 
it was more clear that I wasn’t wear-
ing a bra — nothing too crazy — just a 
fitted blouse of sorts. One day while I 
was in the cafeteria with my friends, 

a guidance counselor approached me 
and said, “Your nipples are protrud-
ing.” I did not have the slightest clue 

about what her comment meant, but 
I assumed it was a positive comment 
so I said plainly, “Thank you.” She 

responded, “No, that means they are 
projecting out,” to which I, once again, 
said, “Thank you.” 

I truly was not trying to be funny 
— I genuinely took that as a compli-
ment because I was in a period of my 

life where I was trying to embrace 
my natural form and I assumed that 
a woman in a higher position would 

support that. I was sorely mistaken. 
She told me to put on a jacket or I 
would be removed from the premises. 
So I grabbed my jacket, stood up and 
walked myself out. The counselor fol-
lowed and I was met with three secu-
rity guards and my principal — who 
was a woman. She explained to me 
that their policy was meant to protect 
me from predatory men. I explained 
that it isn’t my job to conform to 
safeguard myself. She said — and I 
remember this quite explicitly — “If 
you were to go in front of a judge for 
being raped, you would be held at fault 
because you enticed them.”
I cannot make this up. I wish I 
was. An administrator working in an 
institution dedicated to learning told 
me this. I couldn’t believe it. It was 
humiliating. This was the first time I 
had been criminalized for my body by 
an authoritative figure. It would not 
be the last. This was the beginning 
of a tumultuous road ahead where 
I would have to fight for the right to 
autonomy over myself.
The fact that a fellow woman, one 
whom I was supposed to look up to, 
said such vile things to me demon-
strates how deeply rooted the patri-
archy is in all of us — men and women 
alike. The patriarchy can be defined as 
a society in which “men hold the posi-
tions of power and have more privi-
lege: head of the family unit, leaders of 
social groups, boss in the workplace, 
and heads of government. In patriar-
chy, there is also a hierarchy among 
the men.” To be clear, the patriarchy 
is harmful to men and interrupts 
their growth as human beings as well. 
Make no mistake, I am not saying 
women are at fault for the suffering we 
experience. But I am saying that all of 
us reinforce the patriarchal pressures 
in our lives without even realizing it. 
The patriarchy shows its face 
everywhere you go. It’s just a matter 
of recognizing it. See, that’s the thing 
about men — when you call them a 
misogynist, they immediately get 
defensive because they think you’re 
accusing them of some kind of hate 
crime. Sometimes this is true, but it 
doesn’t take the most extreme level of 
hatred toward women for men to have 
misogynistic tendencies. 
Furthermore, if you are a man, you 
are upholding the patriarchy simply 

by existing. The privilege you hold as 
a man does not go away just because 
you acknowledge the strife of women. 
You still hold the obligation to always 
be cognizant of how the space you 
take up impacts the women around 
you. There is nothing you can do to 
rid yourself of your male privilege, 
but rather, you can use it to uplift 
the women around you. Even if you 
think you are a particularly progres-
sive man, remembering to check your 
privilege is of the utmost importance. 
To the men reading this: You hold 
power over women in the job mar-
ket and take away opportunities 
from them. You are more likely to be 
heard in group conversations and 
suppress the voices of women. You 
are more likely to be taken seriously 
at the doctor’s office and therefore 
have, on average, gotten more effi-
cient and effective medical treatment. 
Most importantly: your willingness 
to believe this phenomenon does not 
change the fact that you experience it. 
The reality of the situation is that you 
inadvertently benefit from the sup-
pressive injustice that women endure. 
There is virtually nothing you can 
do to escape that. Does that mean 
there is nothing you should do to be a 
decent human being to the women in 
your life? Absolutely not. You should 
always be striving for an awareness 
of the privilege you hold. We are con-
stantly living in fear of being victim-
ized — the least you could do is walk 
through the world with an acknowl-
edgment of that. 
If you are now thinking to yourself 
that women are strong, independent 
beings who can conquer anything — 
you’re not wrong, but you’re missing 
the point. That type of circular rea-
soning places the responsibility on the 
woman to halt her oppression while 
ignoring the fact that much of her 
torment is out of her control. I cannot 
begin to explain how little grasp we 
have over the patriarchal forces in our 
lives and how absolutely soul-crush-
ing it is to know that my existence will 
always be defined by a man. No mat-
ter how radical I try to be, no matter 
how many “social rules” I break, I will 
always be subject to the patriarchy. 
We live in a man’s world. We have 
generationally formed a society where 
men are at the forefront and women 
are in the background. Can you blame 
me for feeling so powerless? 
At the end of the day, women are in 
this fight alone. I do not care how pro-
gressive a man you consider yourself 
— you are still a misogynist or have 
misogynistic tendencies. To illustrate 
this, let’s take a look at a common 
misconception of the dating scene: 
the friend zone. If you declare you’re 
in “the friend zone” with a woman 
whom you just met — that’s misogy-
nistic. You are categorizing your rela-
tionship with a woman on whether or 
not you are successful in your pursuit 
to seduce her. This deduction misplac-
es the blame onto women for exercis-
ing their right to say no. It devalues 
a woman’s feelings in a relationship 
because it implies that a woman owes 
that man something in return for his 
supposed kindness. It is an explana-
tion used by insecure men to project 
the responsibility onto women when 
they are rejected. It reinforces the 
objectification of women when you 
assume that being kind to a woman

n March 8, 2022, Florida 
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed 
a House Bill 1557, known 
as both the “Parental Rights in 
Education” and the “Don’t Say Gay” 
bill. In February, President Joe 
Biden called the bill “hateful.”
The “Don’t Say Gay” title comes 
from some of the bill’s key passages, 
prohibiting “classroom instruction 
on sexual orientation or gender 
identity in kindergarten through 
grade 3 or in a manner that is not 
age-appropriate or developmentally 
appropriate for students.” The bill 
itself is further reaching than just 
LGBTQ+ issues, impacting the 
health needs of students. Parents 
are able to opt their children out 
of counseling and health services, 
and if students receive any type of 
health service from school, parents 
will be notified. Between the “Don’t 
Say Gay” and the health services 
portion of the bill, the access 
students will have to help outside 
of their parents is worrying, to say 
the least. 
Deciding to exclude words like 
“gay” or “homosexuality” from a 
classroom will not stop a person 
from being Queer; it only makes 
them think that they are alone. 
According to the Trevor Project, 
a nonprofit dedicated to suicide 
prevention among LGBTQ+ kids, 
“LGBTQ youth who learned about 
LGBTQ issues or people in classes 
at school had 23% lower odds of 
reporting a suicide attempt in the 
past 12 months.”
While it is not the first bill of its 
kind to be written, it is unlikely 
to be the last. House Bill 800 in 
Tennessee 
asserts, 
“textbooks 
and 
instructional 
materials 
and 
supplemental 
instructional 
materials that promote, normalize, 
support, or address controversial 
social issues, such as lesbian, gay, 
bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
lifestyles are inappropriate” and 
“the promotion of LGBT issues and 
lifestyles in public schools offends 
a significant portion of students, 
parents, and Tennessee residents 
with Christian values.” Tennessee’s 
bill is not vaguely limited to 
kindergarten through third grade 

like Florida’s; it covers all public 
K-12 classrooms. 
Opponents of Tennesse’s bill 
question the implication of words 
like “normalize” and “address” — 
what about the Queer educators? 
Will pictures of spouses be removed 
from 
their 
classroom 
desks? 
What about the students with 
Queer parents? Are both parents 
allowed to enter the classroom for 
parent-teacher conferences? (The 
question of books and educational 
material will continue to be argued, 
particularly with the banning of 
specific books related to LGBTQ+ 
issues and racial inequality in the 
United States).
Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill 
affecting not only what is said in the 
classroom but outside is chilling. 
Students like Will Larkins, a junior 
in high school from Winter Park, 
Florida, 
are 
worried. 
Larkins 
published an opinion essay in The 
New York Times on March 12, 
explaining the positive influence 
that an understanding teacher had, 
writing, “Education made me hate 
myself less.”
Larkins and their friend Maddi 
Zornek led a walkout of more than 
500 students on the day of the 
signing. Other protests have taken 
place since, notably those including 
Disney employees. The fight for 
LGBTQ+ rights does not seem to be 
over, especially as other states follow 
in Florida’s footsteps. Earlier this 
month, Alabama passed legislation 
banning gender-affirming medical 
care for transgender minors and 
threatening those who attempt 
to provide such cares with prison 
time. They also passed a similar, 
though more severe, K-12 “Don’t 
Say Gay” bill, which would force 
students to use the bathroom and 
locker room of their sex assigned 
at birth. Alabama’s legislation 
would ban classroom instruction 
concerning gender identity and 
sexual orientation in kindergarten 
through fifth grade, further than 
Florida’s K-3 bill. 
Medical 
groups, 
like 
the 
American Medical Association, are 
in great opposition to Alabama’s 
bill. Last year, the organization 
sent a letter to the National 
Governors Association describing 
the detrimental effects and risks 
of banning gender-affirming care 

for trans youth. In the letter, the 
AMA expressed specific concern 
for the higher risks of suicide and 
mental health disorders due to 
stress for transgender minors, 
and stated, “Studies suggest that 
improved body satisfaction and 
self-esteem following the receipt 
of gender-affirming care can have 
tragic health consequences, both 
mental and physical … Studies also 
demonstrate dramatic reductions 
in suicide attempts, as well as 
decreased rates of depression and 
anxiety.” 
Parents are often not licensed 
healthcare professionals, nor are 
they the primary educators for 
kids K-12. The bill is vague, and its 
interpretation has the capability 
to hurt not only the students but 
teachers. Between the ages of six 
to 18, children spend seven to eight 
hours, five days a week in a place 
that they expect will support them 
in their growth and development 
(and allow them to use the bathroom 
where they are most comfortable). 
Their social lives often primarily 
exist within the walls of these 
schools, as do the teachers and 
counselors they confide in. How 
can a bill that excludes help from 
every source other than a parent 
be truly supportive for a growing 
kid or teen? What does that mean 
for parents, who may work most of 
the day and cannot give the kind of 
support that their child deserves 
due to their time and circumstances 
of their home?
Upon learning about LGBTQ+ 
issues, some kids have big “ah-ha” 
moments. Sometimes, they have 
known it their whole life. Removing 
language about these topics will 
not stop children from being Queer, 
nor does including the language 
make the students automatically 
Queer. It will not suddenly make 
them reach out to their parents, 
either. The “Don’t Say Gay” bill 
merely removes the resources 
students rely on in turbulent times 
of their lives, when they are trying 
to figure themselves out, and 
hope that people accept them the 
way they are. Hate has no place in 
the classroom, and removing the 
conversation surrounding it will not 
solve the issues these parents and 
lawmakers are concerned about — 
it will merely silence them. 

Say Gay

O

ver the past few decades, 
climate 
change 
has 
become a major national 
political issue, finding its place at the 
center of the Democratic agenda. 
Despite widespread support among 
Democrats and the country as a 
whole for solving the issue, very 
little 
comprehensive 
legislation 
has been signed. Instead, solutions 
have come in the form of grandiose 
proposals, unbinding pledges and 
local programs with little impact. 
These policies have accomplished 
too little and have ultimately led to 
greater partisan divides that will 
undoubtedly hamper support for 
future solutions. If Democrats truly 
hope to solve the climate crisis before 
it’s too late, they must immediately 
reevaluate their policy platforms and 
find more reasonable solutions that 
can quickly gain national support.
It’s impossible to discuss climate 
policy in the Democratic Party 
without considering the Green 
New Deal, the landmark legislation 
proposed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that would 
fundamentally alter our economy. 
Her plan calls for aggressively 
transitioning to net zero emissions 
by 2030, rapidly phasing out gas 
vehicles 
and 
weatherizing 
all 
buildings in the country to make 
them resistant to extreme weather. 
Beyond the climate proposals in 
the bill, Ocasio-Cortez advocates 
for guaranteed jobs for Americans, 
Medicare for All and a litany of other 
liberal wish list items. While the 
individual proposals of the bill are 
popular, the overall cost is estimated 
to be $16 trillion, a figure that would 
saddle future generations with 
insurmountable debt and likely 
cause severe long-term economic 
decline.
Though the Green New Deal 
carries an unreasonable price tag, 
more realistic solutions also face 
tremendous challenges. The idea 
of a carbon tax, popular among 
economists, would in theory account 
for the negative externalities that 
carbon emissions cause, but in 
practice would accomplish little 
more than hurting the U.S. economy 
relative 
to 
global 
competitors. 
Carbon taxes can be levied on both 
producers, through emissions taxes, 
and consumers, through taxes on 
carbon-intensive products. If levied 
on producers, we would need to 
implement a tax internationally 
in order to avoid directly harming 
American 
producers 
without 
affecting other nations. This seems 
unlikely to occur, and an American 
carbon tax might instead cause oil 
production to shift toward Russia 
and the Middle East, with overall 
global supply remaining unshaken.
If instead the tax was levied on 
consumers, it would likely have 
minimal 
effects, 
as 
consumer 
demand for gasoline is relatively 
inelastic 
and 
typically 
remains 
steady regardless of price. Further, as 
shown by the visceral responses that 
have accompanied recent price hikes 
at the pump, a carbon tax would be 

politically unpopular and quickly 
branded as a de facto tax against 
working Americans.
Among the existing solutions 
already implemented by states, some 
of the most prevalent include electric 
vehicle subsidies, solar credits and 
weatherization assistance. While 
nobody would argue that these 
programs present a comprehensive 
climate solution, evidence suggests 
that they may even do more harm 
than good for the environment. 
Because electric vehicles aren’t 
bound to the same energy efficiency 
standards as gas cars and most 
electricity is rooted in fossil fuels, 
the net social impact of government 
subsidies on electric vehicles has 
been found to be negative $742, 
showing that these subsidies have a 
net negative impact. While over the 
long-term we will eventually need 
to move toward electrification, we 
are not yet at a stage where electric 
products produce net emissions 
benefits. 
Solar credits, another good idea in 
theory, in actuality have an impact 
highly concentrated on wealthy 
families 
who 
could’ve 
already 
afforded to purchase solar to lower 
their energy costs. This diminishes 
the effects of solar credits that could 
instead go to poorer families less 
likely to invest in solar as a cost-
saving measure. In addition, since 
solar credits aren’t correlated with 
the amount of energy ultimately 
generated from panels, subsidy 
spending in areas whose climate 
is unfit for year-round solar use 
negatively 
impacts 
the 
overall 
effectiveness of the program. Finally, 
weatherization assistance, which 
is targeted at low-income families, 
actually has a social benefit of 9.5% 
less than its social cost because of 
the small carbon footprint that low-
income households produce.
With 
many 
proposed 
and 
existing 
solutions 
being 
either 
ineffective or unrealistic, we will 
have to look elsewhere for support 
in fighting climate change. While 
unpopular, perhaps the solution that 
best protects our economy while 
combating global warming would 
be to maintain the use of natural gas 
in the short run, while developing a 
network of nuclear plants to support 
long-term energy production. 
Natural gas has played a major 
role over the past several years in 
accelerating the shift away from 
coal and other fossil fuels, and 
concurrently reducing greenhouse 

gas emissions. Though an ideal 
solution to the climate crisis would see 
an immediate shift toward renewable 
energy sources, the infrastructure to 
support this transition is severely 
lacking, and thus any premature 
attempt to do so could cause energy 
shortages. While natural gas still 
does emit greenhouse gasses, it has 
a lower carbon footprints than other 
fossil fuels and remains a critical 
component of our short-term energy 
supply. Any attempt to restrict its 
use could cause energy price spikes 
that could have crippling economic 
impacts.
While natural gas may be our best 
bet in the short run, nuclear power 
is likely the most effective long-
term solution. Compared to nuclear 
plants, wind farms require 360 
times as much land area and solar 
facilities require 75 times the land 
area to produce the same amount of 
energy, making both unsustainable 
instruments 
for 
powering 
the 
country. Furthermore, wind and 
solar energy are both reliant on 
seasonal factors that would lead to 
an unreliable grid, whereas nuclear 
power can operate year-round. 
Most concerns around nuclear 
power center around the danger 
of a nuclear meltdown, but nuclear 
power is in fact one of the safest 
energy sources, with exceedingly low 
death rates from accidents compared 
to other power sources. The United 
States is already producing 19% of its 
electricity from just 97 reactors, so 
investing heavily in nuclear power 
would allow us to power the entire 
country with existing technology. 
Since the time frame we have to 
solve the climate crisis is so narrow, 
we don’t have the luxury of waiting 
for efficiency boosts in renewable 
power sources. Instead, we need to 
quickly invest in solutions that have a 
proven track record of success.
If the Democrats hope to pass 
meaningful climate legislation, they 
would be well served to redirect 
their energy from untenable plans 
that 
expend 
valuable 
political 
capital to more realistic solutions 
that transition to clean energy 
without risking energy shortages. 
With support for nuclear power and 
natural gas among conservatives, 
Democrats will have an easier time 
passing impactful legislation if they 
focus on those areas. While doing so 
would certainly not solve the entire 
crisis, it would finally be the tangible 
step in the right direction that we 
have been missing.

Climate extremism is unproductive 
— let’s focus on real solutions

T

he 
secular 
American 
burial is in desperate need 
of diversification. It’s a 
little absurd that my only option 
after death seems to be sending my 
family shopping for a cushioned 
casket that properly “captures my 
essence,” only for it to be lowered 
into the ground to decompose and 
never be seen again by the living 
and entirely unbeknownst to my 
dead, impartial body. Frankly, this 
is far from how I would like to be 
laid to rest. 
As 
a 
self-proclaimed 
environmentalist, 
I 
was 
disappointed to find out that the 
traditional funeral process is 
not only expensive for grieving 
families but is also incredibly 
taxing on our environment. The 
embalming process, traditionally 
employed to prevent bodies from 
decaying before the “viewing” 
service 
in 
funerals, 
uses 
a 
toxic concoction of chemicals 
— 
including 
formaldehyde, 
menthol, phenol and glycerin — 
for preservation. An estimated 
800,000 gallons of formaldehyde 
are buried along with the bodies 

that harbor it, posing an acute 
health risk for anyone who is 
exposed to its carcinogenic fumes. 
Even the wood used in the 
construction of caskets and coffins 
is equivalent to roughly 4 million 
acres of forest, a dire figure in 
the face of mass deforestation. 
Even worse, cemeteries across 
the 
United 
States 
take 
up 
approximately 140,000 acres of 
land that require mass amounts of 
water and fertilizer to maintain, 
which could be alternatively used 
for housing or other productive 
lands.
Suppose 
cremation 
is 
any 
better? Think again. According 
to 
National 
Geographic, 
just 
one 
cremation 
“produces 
an 
average of 534.6 pounds of carbon 
dioxide,” and a year’s worth of 
cremations releases an estimated 
360,000 metric tons of CO2 into 
the atmosphere, which is enough 
energy to power about 70,000 
homes for a year. Cremation also 
releases a slew of carcinogenic 
chemicals into our air, including 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, 
mercury and sulfur dioxide, which 
are toxic to both humans and the 
environment. 
This is not to say traditional or 
religious burials that employ these 

methods should be discredited or 
fundamentally changed. Rather, 
people should be presented with 
a variety of options of what to do 
with their bodies postmortem if 
traditional burial practices do not 
speak to their values or morals. 
After all, one size certainly does 
not fit all — why should death be 
any different?
If traditional secular funerals 
aren’t for you, or if you want 
to 
leave 
the 
most 
minimal 
environmental impact after you 
die, here are a few alternative, 
green burial methods. 
One 
company, 
Coeio, 
has 
innovated what they coined as 
an “infinity burial suit,” which is 
woven with threads infused with 
infinity mushroom spores. These 
mushrooms were specifically bred 
to efficiently compost human 
flesh. The superpower of these 
mushrooms, mycoremediation, is 
a fungal process that absorbs and 
purifies toxins found in human 
bodies 
that 
would 
otherwise 
seep into and contaminate the 
environment. While the thought 
of being eaten by mushrooms 
may seem unsettling, I think that 
fungi repurposing my corpse into 
nutrients that will fertilize and 
cultivate the earth sounds like 

a whimsical, environmentally-
conscious dream death. 
Another 
practice, 
the 
sky 
burial, has been performed by 
Tibetan Buddhists for thousands 
of years. After death, a Burial 
Master cuts the deceased body 
into pieces and brings it to a 
selected site at a high elevation. 
Vultures, who congregate at these 
elevations, then eat the body, a 
tradition that Tibetan Buddhists 
believe allows for the soul to travel 
to the heavens and wait for the 
next reincarnation. While these 
sites have become more limited in 
recent years, sky burials are highly 
sustainable and nourish local 
carnivorous 
bird 
populations. 
With 
essentially 
no 
carbon 
footprint, this green burial is an 
example of how people have been 
using more sustainable burial 
practices for many years. 
Have an affinity for marine life 
and the ocean? Look no further. 
The Reef Ball Foundation has 
innovated what they call Reef 
Balls, which are made of special 
marine-grade concrete with a 
“pearl” center composed of the 
cremated remains of loved ones. 
Though cremation isn’t great for 
the environment as previously 
mentioned, these Reef Balls can 

be adorned by the family with 
concrete imprints and marine 
and 
environmentally-friendly 
sea glass and shells before being 
placed on the ocean floor in 
“Eternal Reefs” – cemeteries 
made of Reef Balls. “Designed to 
replicate the natural substrata 
that 
Mother 
Nature 
uses 
for 
her 
reef 
development,” 
Reef 
Balls’ 
perfectly 
neutral 
concrete pH invites a variety 
of marine organisms, including 
fish, 
microorganisms, 
oysters 
and coral, to propagate and 
reside within. Essentially, your 
memorial after death can be 
an opportunity to facilitate the 
survival and balance of marine 
life. 
A newer prototype, created 
by the company Capsula Mundi, 
is an egg-shaped, biodegradable 
pod that corpses would be placed 
in posthumously. Before death, 
the person selects a tree to be 
planted atop their pod after 
burial, allowing the body to 
nourish a piece of nature that 
will grow into a profound symbol 
of everlasting life. Instead of 
cemeteries filled with cement 
and faded gravestones, Capsula 
Mundi hopes to create flourishing 
sacred forests where families 

may visit and care for their loved 
ones who have been eternalized 
in nature. Not only is the ground 
burial a more environmental, 
historic practice, but the trees 
that grow will further replenish 
diminished forests while cleaning 
the air through photosynthesis. 
Spiritually 
and 
literally, 
this 
practice allows for the body to 
exist immortally as repurposed 
forms of nature.
What we decide to do with 
ourselves postmortem should not 
be a limited or generic choice, 
especially 
with 
the 
cultural, 
religious and spiritual significance 
of death. Instead, we should be 
encouraged to pursue our own 
unique 
paths 
of 
posthumous 
eternalization and provided with 
options to express our uniqueness 
and values after our lives have 
ended. For those of us who are 
secular or want to leave a minimal 
environmental impact, we should 
have the knowledge necessary to 
embrace the alternative options to 
traditional burials. As a contrast 
to the darkness and industrial 
nature of traditional burials, it is 
beautiful to visualize our bodies 
being reintroduced into the cycle 
of life in nature, which will carry 
us long after our passage.

E

veryone needs it, but no 
one wants to ask for it. 
“Help” has become a sort 
of dirty word, implying weakness 
and neediness, that we can’t 
handle our problems on our own. 
Using the word “help” has come to 
mean that you have given in to the 
obstacles plaguing your life and 
that you don’t have the strength 
to carry on by yourself. These 
implications are commonplace, 
and they are not only false, but 
harmful. 
I will openly admit that I 
absolutely hate asking for help. 
Ever since I was a kid, I hated 
bothering 
my 
parents 
with 
problems with school or peers 
and was vehemently opposed to 
asking my teachers for assistance 
on homework assignments. I 
always had good grades and big 
groups of unproblematic friends, 
so when I did struggle, I didn’t 
want to bother any of the adults 
in my life with seemingly tiny 
problems — I had never needed 
the help before, and didn’t want to 
start asking then.
As I have aged, I have realized 
that asking for help is the most 
important thing someone can 
do for themselves. Whether it 
be for your physical, mental or 
academic health, getting words 
of advice or affirmation from 
an outside source can make all 
the difference. It may be hard or 
even embarrassing to ask for help, 
but when we get into the habit of 
understanding its benefits, help 
becomes the greatest word one 
can use in their vocabulary.
The pandemic has shown many 
of us that asking for help is vital 
when we feel alone or when we feel 
like we need to talk to someone. 
In a study by the American 
Psychological Association, it was 
found that referrals received 
by psychologists doubled (from 
37% to 62%) from 2020 to 2021, 
and that 68% of psychologists 
reported an increase in the 
number of individuals on their 
waitlists. 
Amid 
a 
time 
of 
such 

uncertainty, the frequency of 
people requesting help for anxiety 
and depression has increased, as 
has the number of people taking 
advantage 
of 
mental 
health 
resources 
such 
as 
telehealth 
and in-person counseling. The 
pandemic 
has 
made 
people 
realize they can’t be alone with 
their thoughts, and that asking 
for help from professionals is the 
best way to get their problems off 
their chests and their minds on 
the road to wellness and balance.
Still, 
though, 
requesting 
help carries a societal weight. 
The British Psychology Society 
found that two types of stigmas 
exist as it relates to seeking 
psychological 
help: 
public 
stigma and self stigma. A “public 
stigma” is external, a collection of 
stereotypes about mental health 
and therapy imposed by those 
around us. Public opinion holds a 
heavy weight on our perspective 
on seeking help, and when there is 
judgment from the public, we find 
ourselves 
avoiding 
counseling 
because of the negative markers 
being applied to us. 
A “self stigma” is internal, 
assigning ourselves labels based 
on our state of mental health, 
claiming we are worthless or 
“unacceptable” and undeserving 
of help. “Public” and “self” 
stigmas go hand in hand, and 
when we hear the stigmas being 
voiced by those around us, we 
tend to apply them to ourselves 
because of social influences, 
especially 
those 
concerning 
mental health. The stigmas that 
both society and ourselves have 
assigned to mental health and 
counseling are what have made 
“help” such a dirty word.
Stigmas 
around 
mental 
health exist everywhere, from 
the television we consume, to 
the dialogues of the people we 
surround ourselves with. These 
stereotypes lack understanding 
about the subject of mental 
wellness, making those who have 
internal struggles or need help 
seem “inhuman” in the eyes of 
society. The way we speak to one 
another makes a difference in our 
perception of mental health as 
well. 

For example, telling someone 
to “just get over” their struggle 
with mental illness does much 
more harm than good. Words 
like these make struggles seem 
small and easily surmountable, 
and to a person already lacking 
motivation, they can be more 
debilitating. The interactions we 
have with others and the media 
often influence how we look at 
ourselves. In the case of mental 
health — an area where sufferers 
already struggle with self-image 
— stereotypes and dismissive 
comments only make getting 
healthy harder.
If we fail to break the stigma 
around the word “help,” we 
ignore the increasingly more 
pertinent necessity of getting 
ourselves assistance in times of 
need. Despite what society may 
tell us, it’s not weird or wrong to 
get help — it’s probably one of the 
most insightful and courageous 
things we can do for ourselves.
Breaking the stigma means 
having real discussions about 
mental health, using empathetic 
language rather than judgemental 
tones and empowering those in 
our lives who struggle or have 
taken steps to get help. The most 
important thing, though, is to 
avoid self stigmas — we cannot 
apply society’s untrue labels to 
ourselves and we must remain 
confident that the decision to ask 
for help is something personal 
and meaningful to ourselves and 
our livelihoods. 
Each one of us should be able to 
openly admit that we need help, 
whether it be for problems we face 
with school or for internalized 
struggles with mental health. 
No one should be mocked or 
marginalized because they have 
sought out therapy, and no one 
should be bullied about making 
an initial request for a listening 
ear and helping hand in times of 
hardship. 
To be our better selves, we 
have to break the stigma around 
“help” and accept the fact that 
some obstacles are too tough to 
overcome on our own. Sometimes 
we need support, and that isn’t bad 
—it’s healthy, and monumentally 
brave. 

T

he 
term 
“reproductive 
rights” 
has 
sparked 
arguably one of the biggest 
political controversies of the last 
few years. Yes, I’m talking about 
the a-word: abortion. There are 
plenty of articles and opinions 
going around about this specific 
right — whether it is one, whether it 
isn’t — but there’s not nearly enough 
discussion of the other reproductive 
rights you are entitled to.
Those able to bear children are 
entitled to certain reproductive 
rights and, like any other kind 
of right, they should know them 
and exercise them. While I will 
mostly direct my language towards 
“women,” as these rights are 
socially associated with “women’s” 
rights, note that these rights extend 
toward anyone who might be or is 
carrying a child, regardless of their 
gender identity. I encourage you to 
take a look at the full list of rights, 
which can be found here.
Many of these reproductive 
rights are variations of human 

rights declarations and bills that 
have been applied to the context of 
motherhood. One I find particularly 
important, which stems from 
human rights arguments, is that 
“everyone is their own person from 
the moment of birth.” This means 
that both mother and baby should 
be treated with dignity and respect. 
On a related note, everyone 
has the right to equitable health 
care free from discrimination, 
a right that is ensured by the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. One hundred ninety-three 
countries have agreed to abide by 
these rights, including the United 
States. This means that everyone 
in the United States is guaranteed 
these human rights, and the rights 
derived from them. Prioritization 
of this particular right is especially 
important for Black mothers, as 
they experience medical racism 
that significantly harms their 
health, as well as the health of their 
babies. For women of Color, the 
risks this causes at each stage of 
childbirth, including labor, delivery 
and postpartum, are elevated. This 
right also means that women have 
the same protections under the law 

while pregnant as they do when 
not. In other words, you cannot 
be discriminated against for the 
listed reasons, including for being 
pregnant. 
According 
to 
the 
Maternal 
Health Task Force at the Harvard 
Chan School of Public Health, 
“(e)very woman has the right to 
information, informed consent and 
refusal and respect for her choices 
and preferences.” This applies to 
all reproductive health choices, 
including childbirth. Education on 
these rights could directly impact 
the health of both mothers and their 
children. Currently, the statistics 
surrounding childbirth are not 
encouraging. The United States’s 
maternal mortality rate is almost 
double that of other developed 
countries, such as Canada, with 
17 in 100,000 American mothers 
dying 
from 
childbirth 
— 
a 
distressingly high number. The 
infant mortality rate is worse, with 
over 500 in 100,000 infants dying, 
and this rate is even higher among 
Southern states. 

A 

few weeks ago, United 
States 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas 
said that debate over increasing the 
number of U.S. Supreme Court seats 
might “compromise” or “chip away 
at the respect” of the institution 
by politicizing what should be an 
impartial body. Less than two weeks 
later, it was revealed that Thomas’s 
wife, Virginia, had urged then-
White House Chief of Staff Mark 
Meadows to overturn the results 
of the 2020 presidential election. 
In the past few years, the Supreme 
Court and its members have become 
shrouded in controversy, due not 
only to the judges themselves but the 
circumstances surrounding their 
appointment.
Ironically, Thomas made his 
comments about protecting the 
court from politics at an event for 
the foundation of former Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah. In 2016, Hatch 
took a leading role in blocking the 
confirmation of Merrick Garland, 
who was nominated by former 
President Barack Obama to fill a 
vacant Supreme Court seat. Hatch 
and his Republican colleagues, 
who controlled the Senate at the 
time, argued that by keeping the 
seat empty, voters would have 
an opportunity to influence the 
court’s composition through the 
2016 presidential election. Garland 
went on to be appointed attorney 
general last year by President Biden. 
The Senate confirmed him with a 
70-30 vote, demonstrating that a 
significant number of Republicans 

approve of his qualifications at least 
for that role. 
In 
2017, 
President 
Donald 
Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch, 
a staunch conservative, to fill 
the seat Democrats intended for 
Garland. Gorsuch was approved by 
a 54-45 vote only after Republicans 
abolished the filibuster for Supreme 
Court confirmations. Sen. Chris 
Coons, D-Del., who voted against 
Gorsuch, recently admitted that 
his decision to vote against the 
“eminently 
qualified” 
nominee 
furthered 
partisan 
animosity 
over judicial appointments. Years 
later, the swift — not to mention 
hypocritical — appointment and 
confirmation 
of 
Justice 
Amy 
Coney Barrett made it clear that 
Republicans cared little about voter 
input. They were instead looking for 
an opportunity to keep conservative 
control of the Supreme Court. It was 
during the confirmation of Barrett 
that some prominent Democrats — 
including Democratic Senate leader 
Chuck Schumer, N.Y., began publicly 
considering expanding the Supreme 
Court. 
While Barrett and Gorsuch are 
controversial because their seats 
are considered “stolen,” controversy 
around Justices Clarence Thomas 
and Brett Kavanaugh is centered 
on the men themselves. In addition 
to his wife’s political activities, 
Thomas’s 
confirmation 
hearing 
is infamous because of Anita Hill, 
who accused Thomas of sexual 
harassment and was, in return, 
grilled by members of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. One of those 
members was Orrin Hatch, who 
suggested some of her charges were 
inspired by “The Exorcist.” More 

recent allegations against Brett 
Kavanaugh from Christine Blasey 
Ford offer a clear parallel.
On top of increasingly prevalent 
issues with their own Supreme 
Court 
appointees, 
Republicans 
have 
stepped 
up 
attacks 
on 
judges nominated by Democrats. 
Republican Senators aggressively 
questioned Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson’s sentencing record on 
those convicted of child sexual 
abuse — ignoring the reasons for 
Jackson’s rulings in order to bring 
about damaging headlines. Sen. 
Tom Cotton, Ark., went as far as 
suggesting that Jackson would have 
defended Nazis in court. 
In his comments in Utah, Thomas 
worried about the future of the 
Supreme Court. This isn’t about the 
future, though — the Supreme Court 
has been compromised by politics. 
Republicans have ignored serious 
character flaws in the cases of 
Thomas and Kavanaugh, selectively 
prevented confirmation hearings 
to capture Barrett and Gorsuch’s 
seats and stepped up character 
assassination toward Democratic 
appointees. 
Democrats’ 
not 
entirely unjustified anger towards 
four associate justices isn’t going 
anywhere. Neither is Republicans’ 
willingness to aggressively capture 
Court seats. Sen. Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C., has said a Republican-
controlled Senate would not have 
considered Jackson. Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ken., said it is “highly 
unlikely” 
a 
Republican 
Senate 
would consider a Biden Supreme 
Court nominee in 2024.

Big moments lift Michigan to 2-1 weekend against Maryland

JOEY GOODSIR
Daily Sports Writer

As fifth-year third baseman Tay-
lor Bump stepped into the batter’s 
box on Friday, it was clear a break-
through was necessary. 
In extra innings, bleeding only 
one run would result in another 
conference loss. So the No. 22 Mich-
igan softball team could not afford 
to strand runners in scoring posi-

tion.
For the Wolverines (26-13 over-
all, 6-6 Big Ten), Bump’s sacrifice 
reach sparked a series-defining 
offensive shift that pushed them to 
2-1 on their roadtrip against Mary-
land (22-18, 8-4).
While it’s easier to picture a 
breakthrough coming in the form 
of a powerful swing, Bump seized 
on her alternative strengths. She 
laid down a bunt a few feet in front 
of home plate, allowing graduate 

second baseman Melina Livingston 
to slide into home — ultimately the 
game-deciding run in a 5-3 win.
“As a big power hitter, people 
don’t necessarily expect a lot of 
bunts to come off my bat, but I love 
bunting,” Bump said. “I think it’s 
something that is often put on the 
backburner a little bit … but I live for 
those moments. The opportunity to 
have a suicide squeeze moment — 
that’s huge.”
As the imperfect record suggests, 

Michigan didn’t go without paying 
the price beforehand. The Wolver-
ines suffered a 5-1 loss to the Ter-
rapins on Thursday after stranding 
10 runners. 
“Sometimes players end up try-
ing to get hits as opposed to just 
tough through an at-bat and make 
solid contact,” Michigan associate 
head coach Bonnie Tholl said. “I 
think that was the mental adjust-
ment that we made (Friday), where 
we were able to rally through some 

of those tough at-bats with two 
outs.”
After Friday’s game-winning 
bunt it was an entirely different 
story, and this was reflected as 
much in the circle as at the plate. 
Maryland’s scoring that earned 
its sole win came from a two-run 
homer in the first inning and a rally 
in the fifth that ended senior right-
hander Alex Storako’s weekend. 
On Friday, fifth-year left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien weathered the 

storm.
Beaubien 
entered 
the 
sixth 
inning with the bases loaded and 
gave up only one hit. While the 
Terrapins tied the game, she held 
Maryland scoreless the rest of the 
way.
Then, Beaubien’s pitching on Sat-
urday proved much less stressful.

There was a moment, just over 
two years ago, that I think will be 
burned into my memory forever.
With COVID-19 shutting down 
the University and the world, the 
newsroom played host to an emer-
gency last night of production. A 
fear of the unknown hung over 
the room, nervous and sad energy 
filled everyone. The night marched 
on, and one by one people left the 
newsroom — but not the sports 
section.
I remember standing on the tile 
floor next to the conference room 
and looking back at the sports desk. 
I remember seeing Lane laugh as 
she talked with Lily. I remember 
Jared, Nick, Spencer and Brandon 
all doing stupid things. I remember 
Ethan standing next to me, on the 
verge of crying for probably the 
eighth time that night.
I remember saying something to 
him along the lines of, “This won’t 
go away. This’ll be back. We’ll be 
back.”
Ethan never made it back for a 
night of production in the newsroom.

The Michigan Daily was never 
about journalism for me. It wasn’t 
the culmination of a life-long pas-
sion for Michigan sports or a step 
on the way to my dream of becom-
ing a journalist. It wasn’t sup-
posed to make me a talented sports 
reporter.
Instead, I joined because my 
freshman seminar teacher had us 
read a men’s soccer article from 
The Daily in class. Lost and scared 
in Ann Arbor, I struggled to find 
friends or a place of belonging. 
Then we read that article in class 
and I thought to myself, “I like 
sports and I like writing, hopefully 
they take just anyone.” Thankfully, 
they did.
That’s why I joined. Why I 
stayed is because of Mike and 
Laney and so many other people 
who made it the place to be. Talk-
ing about sports, telling stories, 
playing touch football and euchre, 
laughing and forgetting about 
the problems that swirled around 
us, they made this big university 
small. The place and the people are 
what The Daily is to me. The place 
and the people are everything to 

SportsMonday: An imperfect, 
bittersweet goodbye

LANE KIZZIAH
Daily Sports Writer

Today, I went to my last meet-
ing at The Michigan Daily, which 
has me thinking a lot about my 
first. 
It was the fall of freshman year, 
and I went to The Daily’s mass 
meeting planning to join the news 
section or maybe arts. Growing up, 
I wasn’t exactly a sports fanatic. I 
went to high school in downtown 
Chicago where we didn’t have a 
football team. I’d never been to a 
professional basketball game, and 
I really only went to Cubs games 
for the hotdogs.
But the sports section lured 
me in. There were probably 20 
guys sitting around a desk that 
was covered in a seemingly ran-
dom assortment of crap — tons of 
discarded sheets of paper, a toy 
Transformer, an empty fishbowl. 
The bulletin boards were covered 
with old press passes, notes and 
edited stories that had accumulat-
ed over the years. They said they 
were the most fun section, and 
that was all I needed to hear.
When I signed up, I thought 
The Daily would be a fun little 
extracurricular. I had no way of 
anticipating all of the different 
things it would mean to me over 
the course of four years. 
But at times, I didn’t think I 
would spend four years on the 
section. I didn’t love Michigan 
when I first got here and even con-
templated transferring. It was the 
sports section that made me fall 
in love with this school. There’s 
something about The Daily —not 
just the work of it, but the people, 
the culture, the physical space — 

that makes you feel like you have a 
purpose. 
At times, it’s been my biggest 
source of pride. It’s been the home 
base I raced to after my last class, 
a place I refused to leave until 2 
am when games of euchre had run 
their course and 50-cent Cokes 
had lost their appeal. 
At other times, it’s been the 
source of hair-tugging, fist-balling, 
snot-nosing frustration. But even 
those times don’t seem so bad now 
that I’m saying goodbye. 
As a Sports Writer, beat mem-
ber and, finally, Managing Sports 
Editor, The Daily has taken up 
different amounts of my time and 
consciousness, each of which has 
made me into the person I am 
today in different ways. I have 
loved and cherished each one of 
these roles, but none have made as 
big of a difference in my life as the 
weeks following that first meeting. 
The weeks that made me stay at 
Michigan.
I’ve tried to pinpoint what it was 
that originally drew me into the 
Daily, but there was no single fac-
tor. It’s a blur of 2 am sledding trips, 
walks to softball games, jumps in 
the river, a sense of confidence and 
a passion for something I knew I 
was good at. And every softball 
game I covered and every late-
night Denny’s run I went on made 
me feel like I was part of something 
bigger, something important.
My co-MSE, Kent, has had to 
remind me that we’re never going 
to be satisfied with what we say 
in these final columns. There’s no 
word that encompasses the feeling 
of complete commitment, com-
plete acceptance, complete love 
that I’ve found here. Any attempt I 
make at summarizing this experi-
ence will be, at best, an inaccurate 

approximation. At worst, it’ll be 
really fucking cheesy. 
But anyone who’s ever been on 
the sports section will know the 
feeling I’m talking about. It’s in all 
of that seemingly random crap cov-
ering the sports desk. It’s in NYPD 
runs and chair monkey games and 
road trip stories that aren’t funny 
to anyone outside of the section 
because they just wouldn’t get it. 
And, as anyone who’s graduated 
could probably tell you, it’s really 
hard to give that feeling up. 
Last fall, I was interviewing 
Daily sports alumni, and I asked 
what it was like to go back to the 
newsroom after you graduate:
“Some of my best memories in 
college were made because of The 
Michigan Daily and you step into it 
and you kind of get echoes of those 
memories,” someone told me. “You 
look over to the design desk or the 
statement desk and you see the 
people who you cared about and 
you loved when you were there 
yourself, but then you blink and 
you realize that the person who’s 
sitting there isn’t the person your 
mind imagined was sitting there — 
it’s someone completely different, 
making their own memories. It’s 
bittersweet.” 
Today, at my last meeting, I 
finally understood what he was 
talking about. I looked around at all 
of the new people that had joined 
the section since my tenure ended 
in December, talking about all of 
the inside jokes and funny stories 
that had happened this semester. 
And it was bittersweet. It isn’t 
my section anymore. It’ll keep 
growing and changing and evolv-
ing long after I’m gone.
But it’ll always be there for the 
next freshman who walks in and 
decides to make it their own.

The Daily.
The newsroom is where I met 
my roommates and some of my 
best friends. It’s where I went 
when I was happy and where I 
went when I was sad. When I was 
failing classes and the possibility 
of a future seemed ludicrous, the 
newsroom remained a steadying 
force. Its soft roof, the posters, the 
items hiding in the corner, a ketch-
up packet on the light, a broken 
Transformers toy, a woven basket, 
ping pong paddles, random play-
ing cards strewn across the desk, 
an Indiana mini bat, a maize t-shirt 
from a State News game past, nap-
kins and forks, Steve Pikiell’s head, 
pens and so many more items lit-
ter the background of my favorite 
memories.
The newsroom had, over the 
course of 18-odd months, become 
the constant in my life. Become 
the source of my life. Then, on that 
depressing March night, it was 
taken away.
Over the next two years, I 
changed a lot. The Daily changed 
a lot. The sports section changed a 
lot, despite our best efforts. Zoom 
bonding and Pictionary became 
standard-issue ways to stay con-
nected, but we all know it wasn’t 
the same.
The words I told Ethan on the 
last night of production came back 
to haunt me, eating away at my every 
waking moment. The sports section 
wasn’t even close to what it had been 
before. We were barely surviving.
***
I can’t properly convey to you 
what this place and community 
mean to me. Emotions are not my 
strong suit — anyone who’s had 
more than a three second inter-
action with me will tell you that 
— but The Daily is the epicenter 
of my college experience. It’s the 
only reason I’ve cried in college, all 
three times.
It made me angry, frustrated, 
ashamed, disappointed and just 
plain sad more times than I could 
count. It showed me how to grow 
up and how to deal with problems. 
It did what this esteemed Universi-
ty often failed to do and taught me. 
It gave me my happiest moments. 
It’s a place I’m forever indebted to.
This past fall, when we finally 
returned to the newsroom and I 
walked up the stairs to this fan-
tastic place and took in the empty 

shell of the sports desk, a broad 
smile stretched across my face. 
When the sophomores and other 
writers I hadn’t seen in person 
for months walked into the news-
room, I couldn’t have been happi-
er. I was home and hopefully they 
would be too.
Months passed, and still things 
weren’t the same as before. They 
wouldn’t be while I was one of 
their editors. But things were 
better. The sports section wasn’t, 
as I feared, dying. The reasons I 
joined, the reasons I wanted to 
invest so much time and effort 
into this section started popping 
up and working their way out 
from the shadows.
Four months after my tenure 
ended, I walked into the news-
room to put my penultimate 
article through edits. I didn’t 
know the names of half the faces 
clustered around the sports desk; 
they were a bunch of freshmen 
and sophomores who joined in 
the winter, after my editor tenure 
ended.
As I went through edits, I lis-
tened to snippets of conversa-
tion and watched people buzz 
around to share stories and laugh. 
I bugged some people about a fea-
ture for women’s gymnastics and 
enjoyed some hijinks.
I’d never felt more at peace. A 
book had replaced the ketchup 
packet, the transformer was hid-
den somewhere and the desk was 
still too clean.
But everything I’d wanted for 
two years was there on that night. 
The memories I’d formed as a 
freshman and sophomore rushed 
back. The fear and doubt and 
worry that lived in my mind dis-
appeared in an instant.
On our final night of produc-
tion this year, I’m going to stand in 
the same spot I did two years ago. 
I’m going to look back and see a 
freshman on sports do something 
stupid and have their friends — 
who are also on sports — laugh 
at them. I’m going to see people 
try to give edits as chaos unfolds 
around them. I’m going to watch, 
in real time, as someone forms the 
same bond with this place that I 
have.
I’m going to see something I 
will never see again, and it will 
be a long time before I feel that 
happy.

SportsMonday: 
All I ever wanted

The Michigan baseball team has 
found the zone.
In an up and down year, three 
straight games of consistent pitch-
ing have been a difficult feat. The 
pitchers showed flashes of potential 
all year. But against Michigan State, 
they finally put it all together.
The Wolverines (20-15 overall, 

6-3 Big Ten) dominated on Saturday 
and Sunday, winning 8-2 and 6-3 
respectively, to complete a three-
game weekend sweep of the Spar-
tans (13-19, 2-7). The pitching staff 
showed its top form in what could 
be a turning point for the remainder 
of the season.
“I think it’s just the thing our 
staff needed,” sophomore right-
hander Chase Allen said. “ … We got 
a bunch of great dudes with great 
work and work ethic and a great 

pitching coach leading us … so I just 
think it was a matter of time and 
now we’re finally seeing it.”
But for the pitchers to feast, first 
the offense had to establish itself. 
Going into Saturday, the Michigan 
bats remained hot from their 18-run 
slugfest on Friday.
With two outs and two men on 
in the first inning, junior designated 
hitter Tito Flores sparked the hot 
start with a two-RBI double over 
the second baseman’s head. Min-

utes later, senior first baseman Jack 
Van Remortel mashed a two-run 
double of his own to establish a 5-0 
lead before Michigan State even 
reached the plate.
After the hot start, junior right-
hander Cam Weston didn’t give 
the Spartans any breathing room. 
Containing their hitters in a 1-2-3 
inning, Weston made quick work 
in one of the Wolverines’ most com-
plete innings of the year.
Weston’s dominance continued 

through seven innings, as he tied his 
season-high with nine strikeouts 
and allowed just two runs. In relief, 
junior left-hander Jacob Denner 
cruised through the final batters, 
sealing the 8-2 victory.
On Sunday, Allen notched the 
third dominant start of the week-
end, throwing five scoreless innings 
and allowing just two hits.
As a unit, Michigan’s starters 
had one of their best weekends of 
the season. Sophomore left-hander 

Connor O’Halloran, Weston and 
Allen combined for 21 strikeouts 
and conceded just four runs in 18 
innings.
“We’ve taken the punches, we’ve 
been knocked down and we’ve just 
played in so many different kinds 
of games,” Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said.

“And after that, we knew we had 
a lot of ground to make up, and 
it was improbable that we were 
going to be able to do it.”

F

ORT WORTH, Texas — 
The No. 3 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team entered 
the NCAA National Semifinal as the 
Raleigh Regional Champion and a 
favorite to advance to the final.
There were high expectations for the 
Wolverines, who have rightfully earned 
high praise all season. They won the Big 
Ten Championship and the Regional 
Championship, building momentum 
and setting themselves up for success 
Thursday night.
But those past successes could not 
guarantee a return trip to the National 
Final. A strong start faded into the 
Wolverines’ (26-5 overall) lowest score 
of the season at 196.2875 and a last-place 
finish. No. 2 Florida (29-0-1) won the 
meet, 197.9750-197.8375-197.200, with 
No. 7 Auburn (22-8-1) also advancing 
to the final with a second-place finish. 
Meanwhile, No. 11 Missouri’s (14-7) 
season also came to a close with a 
third place finish.
“We picked a bad day to have 
a bad day,” Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki said. 
Despite the end result, Michigan 
started off strong with a solid 
performance on its top-ranked floor 
exercise. Senior Abby Brenner kicked 
off the rotation with an electrifying 
9.8625-point performance, and it 
seemed like Michigan was off to 
another historic night out of the gate.
Senior Abby Heiskell followed 
Brenner’s routine with a 9.900, 
complete with stuck landings and 
beautiful flips throughout her 90 
seconds. Heiskell ended by pointing 
at the sky, and then leaped into her 
traditional double fist-pumps while 
running back to her teammates.
That success continued as senior 
Natalie Wojcik stuck the landing on her 
first tumbling pass, a key ingredient to 
some of her top scores on the event this 
season. Wojcik’s stellar routine earned her 

a 9.9125, which was followed 
by junior Sierra Brooks’ 9.900 
and junior Gabby Wilson’s 
9.9125.
The 49.425 team score 
on floor exercise — the 
third best floor score 
at NCAA Nationals in 
team history — gave the 
Wolverines 
momentum 
heading 
into 
the 
second 
rotation, but Michigan led the 
pack by only a slim 0.0125, with Auburn, 
Florida and Missouri trailing behind.
The Wolverines followed that up with a 
solid performance in its first-ranked vault, 
including three 9.8875s from sophomore 
Reyna Guggino, Wojcik, and Wilson. Brooks 
was the highest scorer for the Wolverines in 
the event with a 9.900, and Michigan was 
cheering louder than they had all season 
with every landing.

But even with those high scores, the 
overall 49.4250 on the event was not good 
enough to keep Michigan in first place 
headed into the third rotation.
 better on the floor exercise from Suni 
Lee and Derrian Gobourne to overtake 
Michigan for first place. Halfway through 
the competition, all four teams were 
within 0.500 of each other, indicating that 
it would be a tight finish no matter what.
In order to stay competitive headed into 
the final rotation on the balance beam — 
its worst event — Michigan had to hit three 
9.9s or better on the uneven bars.
Heiskell nailed her leadoff routine 
with excellent pivots and handstands 
throughout. Her stuck landing earned 
her a 9.9125, giving the Wolverines a solid 
start on the event. It seemed like Michigan 
could get the job done.
But then, Brenner fell in the second slot 
of the rotation, earning a mere 9.000. That 
put pressure on the next competitors to 
earn scores that would keep Michigan in 
a competitive position to advance to the 
National Final.
“I had hoped that (our) consistency 
would be a benefit to us today,” Plocki said. 
“But sometimes all it takes is one little 
thing to derail you from that sort of zone, 
and sometimes it’s just not your day.”

That looked like a momentary lapse at 
first, and sophomore Naomi Morrison’s 
9.8875 seemed to get the Wolverines back 
in that zone. The volume increased from 
the players’ corral and the Michigan 
faithful as Brooks’ 9.950 and Wojcik’s 
9.925 brought the total of 9.9-plus scores 
for the Wolverines to three. 
But still, it turned out to be not enough.
In the anchor position, freshman Jacey 
Vore over-rotated on her last handstand, 
was forced to dismount too close to the tall 
bar and fell to the mat. The resulting 8.975 
forced Michigan to count Brenner’s 9.000, 
dropping Michigan 0.6375 behind second-
place Florida.
“(The counted fall on bars) gave up 
probably 0.9000,” Plocki said. “And after 
that, we knew we had a lot of ground to 
make up, and it was improbable that we 
were going to be able to do it.”

Despite the best efforts of the 
Wolverines, the margin was too much 
headed into the final rotation. On beam, 
the nerves settled in, and Michigan 
suffered two more falls, though those 
were less consequential. 
Facing those steep odds — and in 
the final routines of their collegiate 
careers — Heiskell and Wojcik shined. 
Heiskell’s 9.900 was her second highest 
of the season, and Wojcik’s beautiful 
9.8625 elicited resounding cheers and 
applause from even the most vocal 
opponent fans.
“I’m incredibly proud of the culture 
that we have in our program,” Plocki 
said. “After 33 years, last year and this 
year they have been some of the most 
amazing athletes I’ve ever coached, not 
just athletically but personally.”
Following up a historic National 
Championship last season, Michigan 
held the No. 1 ranking for eight weeks. 
They were consistent all year long and 
only had one meet — bar on Thursday 
night — scoring below 197.000.
Even when the outcome looked grim, 
the Wolverines stood tall. But in the 
end, their efforts weren’t enough to 
repeat last season’s historic success.
