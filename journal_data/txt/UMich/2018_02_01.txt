Former Michigan Governor 

John Engler has been chosen for 
the interim president of Michigan 
State 
University 
Wednesday 

morning 
morning, 
following 

the Larry Nassar scandal that 
prompted the resignation of 
university president, Lou Anna 
Simons. Students and faculty 
protested the decision in droves 
at the university board of trustees 
meeting that same day.

Engler is a Republican and 

Michigan State University alumni 
who graduated in 1971 with a 
degree in agricultural economics. 
He served as Michigan’s governor 
from 1991 to 2002.

He 
was 
voted 
into 
the 

position by MSU’s Board of 
Trustees, which consists of four 
Democrats and four Republicans, 
unanimously.

“We owe it to them to fix the 

problems and to change the 
culture so that a better MSU will 
be their legacy, and that they 
know something positive came 
out of their suffering,” he said in 
a public statement Wednesday 
afternoon.

Despite the unanimous vote, 

many students and faculty at the 
University have criticized his 
selection. Students came to voice 
their concerns at the Board of 
Trustees meeting later that day in 
a “flood” of protest. One of these 
concerns, felt by faculty members 

Award-winning journalist 

Brooke Jarvis and award-
winning 
anthropologist 

Jason De León, an associate 
professor at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
participated 

in a discussion Wednesday 
afternoon about the stories 
and 
findings 
behind 

immigration 
statistics. 
A 

day after President Donald 
Trump’s State of the Union 
focusing on more stringent 
immigration 
policy, 
both 

panelists explored the ripple 
effects of immigration policy 
on individuals and families, 
and the intersections therein, 
moderated by Ann Lin, an 
associate professor of public 
policy. 

The 
discussion, 
which 

was part of the Livingston 
Lectures hosted by Wallace 
House 
and 
sponsored 
by 

the Ford School of Public 
Policy, began with Jarvis 
summarizing 
her 
article 

“Unclaimed”, 
published 

in The California Sunday 
Magazine. 
The 
article 
is 

about a unidentified man in a 
comatose state who spent 16 
years in the hospital. He was 
suspected to be a migrant, 
but there was not much to his 
story.

“His story was so short, it 

was just a shadow of a story,” 
Jarvis said.

Over those 16 years, many 

people contacted the hospital 
thinking that the man was 
their loved one. Jarvis was 
struck by number of families 
that endured the loss of a 
loved one attempting to cross 
the border.

“The point of the story 

was to learn more about all 
these families and what their 
experience was like,” Jarvis 
said.

Jarvis 
and 
De 
León—a 

recent 
MacArthur 
Genius 

honoree — both talked about 
Facebook and other online 
groups that have been created 
for the sole purpose of sharing 
stories about and looking for 
loved ones that have been lost 
crossing the border.

“It’s this whole world of 

people sharing stories and 
sharing pictures, either of 
someone they’ve lost or of 
someone whose been found,” 

Jarvis said.

The discussion then moved 

to President Donald Trump’s 
anti-immigration rhetoric and 
his plans to build a wall, and 
then moved to immigration 
laws in general. Trump vowed 
to tighten restrictions on 
immigrants during the State 
of the Union Tuesday evening, 
blasting terror attacks he 
claimed were enabled by the 

This flu season is shaping up 

to the most severe since the 2009 
swine flu pandemic. According 
to the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
flu 

season typically peaks between 
December and February the 
United States. As we near the 
height of the season, University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
have 

flooded into University Health 
Service.

Researchers have said cold 

weather and a less effective flu 
vaccination has enabled the 
efficacy of the virus this season. 
Additionally, a particularly hard-
hitting strain of the virus, H3N2, 
make up 80 percent of flu cases 
this year. According to UHS, 
the flu vaccination is 70 percent 
effective in preventing the illness 
in healthy patients.

Arnold Monto, a professor 

at the School of Public Health, 
said this year’s vaccination is 
less effective than usual due to a 
“triple whammy.” 

“We’ve got big outbreaks, 

we’ve got the virus that is

Citizen groups argue police positions on new commission will be conflict of interest

Based on several incidents of 

police brutality and concerns 
of transparency within the Ann 
Arbor police department, the 
Human Rights Commission is 
assembling a task force to draw a 

charter for a police review board. 
Though City Council, HRC and 
local community groups agree 
on the need for the commission, 
they disagree on whether City 
Council members, City staff and 
the deputy police chief should sit 
on the board.

The purpose of the police 

review board, currently referred 

to as the Co-Produced Policing 
Commission, is to train and 
educate the police and general 
public, 
review 
community 

complaints 
and 
police 

interactions, improve community 
policing outcomes and foster 
positive relationships between 
Ann Arbor residents and the 
police force. As a first step, HRC 

is forming a temporary task force 
made up of community members 
who will design a charter for the 
Council to vote on. The charter 
will include bylaws and a general 
framework for the community-
based commission.

The 
HRC 
is 
accepting 

applications for the task force

The
International
Issue


According to activist Cherie 

Brown, 
the 
first 
Jewish-

American Princess didn’t have 
a Canada Goose jacket or a 
Love Your Melon beanie — she 
was a woman named Marjorie 
Morningstar, 
from 
a 
book 

published more than half a 
century ago.

“It was during a period in the 

50s after the Holocaust, where 
Jews had had a third of their 
people 
decimated,” 
Brown 

said. “There was a feeling 
that upward mobility could 
be a vehicle for security. The 

JAP stereotype is the blaming 
of Jewish women for the 
upward mobility of the Jewish 
community in the attempt to 
try to escape anti-Semitism.”

Brown, founder and CEO of 

National 
Coalition 
Building 

Institute – an organization 
that promotes social change 
and offers training in diversity, 
equity and inclusion – hosted 
a workshop titled “What is 
Anti-Semitism and Why is it 
Everyone’s 
Concern?” 
with 

a group of about 20 students 
Wednesday at the Michigan 
Union. 
Student 
Life 
and 

Michigan Hillel co-sponsored 
the event.

Brown 
discussed 
three 

primary signifiers of anti-
Semitism. The first, she said, 
was the unfair targeting and 
blaming of Jewish people.

“All kinds of things are going 

on – all kinds of issues – but 
you’re singling out the Jewish 
people, saying, ‘It’s your fault.’ 
The history of anti-Semitism 
is Jews being singled out for 
blame,” she said. 

The second was a strategy 

of division, what Brown called 
“diverting the attention of 
people from the oppression 
around them” to focusing and 
fixating on Jewish people. The 
third signifier was isolation.

“Jews were ghettoized 

and 
not 
allowed 
to 

participate in the rest of 
society,” Brown said. “Any 
time Jews get isolated out, 
that is anti-Semitism.”

Brown also illustrated 

what she called the hook, a 
self-fulfilling cycle of anti-
Semitism and racism. In 
her diagram, a fear of anti-
Semitism 
makes 
Jewish 

communities 
“scared 

active.”

“The fear propels us to 

action,” Brown said. “We 
might interrupt things, we 
might try to take charge 
of things. You do that 
particularly around people 
of color and what’s it called? 
That’s racism. It’s a hook. 
It’s 
the 
intersection 
of 

racism and anti-Semitism. 
It’s a dynamic.”

Conversation 
turned 

to 
the 
Central 
Student 

Government 
resolution 

to divest from companies 
that 
operate 
in 
Israel. 

The 
resolution 
passed 

for the first time in the 
University’s 
history 
last 

November.

CSG 
representative 
Izzy 

Baer, an LSA sophomore, said 
she authored the resolution for 
Brown to speak to CSG after 
the vote. 

“I 
was 
an 
outspoken 

student during the divestment 
resolution, more on the side of 
I don’t think that this should 
be in the hands of CSG because 
we’re 
students 
and 
we’re 

not experts on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict overall,” 
Baer said. “I think a lot of 
Jewish students talked about 
how they felt targeted from 
this because they felt it was 
direct target on the state of 
Israel. There’s so much nuance 
to anti-Semitism as a form 
of oppression and it’s really 
complicated and it’s not really 
talked about.”

LSA senior Joe Goldberg 

also attended the workshop. 
Goldberg serves as chief of 
staff to CSG president Anushka 
Sarkar, and was the center of 
controversy during #UMDivest 
for alleged ethics violations. 
Goldberg 
previously 
served 

as Hillel’s External Relations 
chair. 

“Contemporary 
anti-

Semitism I think is a very 
interesting topic for a lot of 
reasons, mostly because it’s so 
ambiguous,” he said. “There 
isn’t really a defined answer of 
what it is. As a senior, I started 
to feel it for the first time on 
campus, and when I look back 
at my time at Michigan and 
my time in internships and 
communal activities, I realize 
I’ve experienced much more 
than I’ve ever given myself 
credit for.”

visa lottery system and chain 
migration. 

“We’ve conflated the war 

on terrorism with southern 
border security ... it’s a way to 
generate lots of fear, it’s a way 
to generate lots of spending,” 
De León said.

Jarvis talked about the ways 

current 
immigration 
policy 

can impact families, especially 
young children. Though having 
an adult child in the United 
States is a way to obtain a visa, 
having an underage child is not. 
Because of this, many kids are 
left without one or both parent 
due to deportation.

“There are lots of people who 

are deported, leaving behind 
American 
children, 
which 

opens a question of what’s best 
of these children whose lives 
are bound up in the future of 
our country,” she said.

In 
the 
question 
and 

answer session that followed 
the 
discussion, 
some 
of 

the 
questions 
were 
about 

intersectionality, 
especially 

with feminist movements such 
as 
the#MeToo 
movement. 

Both speakers, as well as Lin 
agreed immigration issues and 
feminist issues are interrelated.

“One of the fears that women 

face that men face less is the 
fear of sexual violence and 
that is often a feature of the 

experience, particularly when 
men are trusting smugglers to 
take them across the border,” 
Lin said.

De 
León 
expanded 
on 

Lin’s sentiment, pointing out 
women face more issues than 
men throughout the entire 
immigration process.

“It’s not just at the border, 

it’s during the entire route that 
gender and issues of sexuality 
come up,” he said.

The 
discussion 
concluded 

with the speaker’s’ thoughts 
about what immigration policy 
should look like going forward. 
The speakers agreed that the 
policy should be rooted in 
understanding these traumatic 
experiences going forward.

“There is no give in our 

policies 
for 
people 
from 

countries where we are a large 
part of the reason they are 
migrating,” Lin said.

Lin 
stressed 
a 
country’s 

immigration policies reflect a 
lot about its ideals.

“It’s really about what we 

think this country stands for 
and how we think it’s going to 
grow and flourish,” she said.

M ATISSE’S MODE RN DR AWINGS

SARAH KUNKEL/Daily

“Matisse Drawings: Curated by Ellsworth Kelly,” an exhibit in the UMMA, displays many of Henry Matisse’s 
modern drawings.

through Feb. 5 and the resolution 
will be voted on at the upcoming 
City Council meeting Monday.

HRC 
member 
Leslie 

Stambaugh 
emphasized 
the 

City’s work toward recruiting a 
diverse group of candidates for 
the task force.

“We put this out very broadly 

– we didn’t want to pre-judge,” 
Stambaugh said. “We know 
we 
wanted 
broad 
diversity 

in this group, we want broad 
perspectives and background 
in this group, but we did not 
say we wanted people who 
are 
knowledgeable 
about 

police, for example, and did 
not say we wanted any specific 
characteristics. But the people 
who are applying this have 
 

those characteristics – some of 
them are knowledgeable about 
police, some are social workers, 
people involved in education, 
some 
involved 
in 
police 

oversight. We have a really good 
group of people.”

Though 
a 
majority 
of 

the 
community 
agrees 
on 

the purpose of the board, 
disputes 
over 
who 
will 

serve 
on 
the 
commission 

divide the Council and some 
residents. 
Transforming 

Justice Washtenaw, a group 
that advocates for restorative 
alternatives to policing and 
incarceration, strongly opposes 
members of Council and the 
police 
from 
being 
included 

in 
the 
commission. 
Rather, 

members Lori Saginaw and 
Julie Quiroz believe the board 
should function independently 
as a Civilian Police Review 
Board — comprised of Ann 
Arbor 
community 
members 

— and involve the deputy 
police chief and assistant city 
 

attorney solely as advisers.

“We are emphasizing that it 

is crucially important that it be 
independent, be transparent, 
be representative and well-
funded,” Quiroz said. “The key 
features are no City staff; the 
HRC selects the candidates 
from the original applicant 
pool, and we see representation 
on that task force of the HRC 
and of residents that are most 
impacted by policing.”

Quiroz 
highlighted 
the 

fact this independence would 
avoid the police from policing 
themselves. The CPRB would 
be able to review complaints 
and allow community members 
to have a say in investigations 
but would not take away from 
the responsibilities of the police 
force.

“We don’t want to babysit the 

police but we want to represent 
the community,” Quiroz said. 
“The police are paid by the 

community, 
their 
salaries 

come from our tax dollars and 
the City’s budget and it’s not a 
radical idea to have oversight 
and it’s not about punishing 
the police or about taking 
away their independence or 
professionalism.”

Members of TJW support 

the HRC’s 2014 commission 
proposal, 
which 
emphasized 

an independent, all-volunteer 
civilian police review board. 
However, 
Hillard 
Heintze 

LLC 
— 
the 
Chicago-based 

security firm HRC hired to 
review the Ann Arbor police 
force — released a report with 
conflicting recommendations to 
form a commission based on the 
data collected. The suggested 
board, CPPC, included members 
of City Council in addition to 
community members.

City Administrator Howard 

Lazarus 
intends 
to 
include 

members of the City staff and 
police on the commission, such 
as the city attorney and deputy 
police chief.

“I have to have support from 

the city attorney’s office because 
there are limits under the state 
law as to what we can do, and 
it’s important to be inclusive of 
the police department,” Lazarus 
said. “I view this task force 
as a collaborative process to 
get something before Council 
that’s reflective of the goals that 
Council has established.”

Though 
the 
City 
and 

community groups like TJW 
disagree on the City staff and 
police 
involvement 
on 
the 

board, Lazarus emphasized the 
community is looking for the 
same overall vision.

“I don’t think there’s much 

difference in intent or desire 
between the groups speaking 
forcefully at HRC meetings 
and what the council’s intent 
is, which is to have a group 
of 
citizens 
from 
diverse 

backgrounds and parts of the 
community evaluate the ways 
in which the Ann Arbor police 
department interacts with its 
residents,” Lazarus said. “I think 
what everyone desires in the 
end is having an exceptionally 
well 
trained 
tactical 
police 

department to also be on the 
leading edge of community 
policing in the engagement of all 
members of our community so 
that everyone feels safe.”

Councilmember 
Graydon 

Krapohl, D-Ward 4, a liaison 
to 
the 
HRC, 
highlighted 
 

the need for compromise from 
both sides to reach a conclusion.

“Nobody’s 
trying 
to 
pull 

the wool over anyone’s eyes, 
our intention is to keep it 
transparent and open and that 
all parties involved listen and 
that everyone gives a little bit 
in order to move forward,” 
Krapohl said.

However, 
Stambaugh 

emphasized 
the 
need 
for 

distance between the board and 
the police force.

“I would like this group to 

interview the police and to get 
the information they need but 
not to have the police to be in 
the group,” Stambaugh said. 
“You don’t want (the police) 
constraining the discussion if 
you can help it…But you don’t 
want (the police) closed out.”

Quiroz supports the HRC’s 

initial proposal and agrees the 
board should be centralized on a 
resident-based perspective.

“As a resident, how would you 

feel and how freely do you think 
you could speak if the group you 
were a part of was dominated 
by those very powerful three 
individuals?” 
Quiroz 
asked. 

“It’s not going to create the 
most open exchange of ideas. So 
 

what we’re asking is for it to be 
community centered and that 
we’d be able to rely on those staff 
members for advice and support 
– it’s not that we don’t value 
their input, it’s just that we don’t 
think they should be on it and 
running it. And if they’re on it, 
it’s pretty hard for their voices 
to not carry a lot of weight.”

Stambaugh 
emphasized 

the need to include all parties 
involved but create a restriction 
on the voting rights of City staff 
and police members if they are 
placed on the board.

“I think you’re going to find 

that the police and the city 
administrator are not going 
to have any voting rights, this 
is where we are negotiating 
to how much the police and 
the city administrator will be 
 

a part of it,” Stambaugh said. 
“If you want buy-in, you have 
to include all of the people who 
are going to be affected by it, 
but you do want the community 
to design this and for it to be 
designed 
well 
enough 
that 

the Council votes on it. We 
would like it to be community 
generated.”

Overall, Krapohl focused on 

the board’s purpose to build 
trust between the police force 
and the community of Ann 
Arbor in order for residents 
to 
be 
treated 
equally 
in 
 

investigations.

“I think that’s the most 

important thing to come out 
of this – to develop greater 
trust. Any person that has an 
interaction with the police or 
law enforcement be treated 
fairly and like everyone else,” 
Krapohl said. “Forming this 
commission is one of the most 
important things this Council 
will do over the next few years 
because I think it’s important 
that all of our residents feel 
they have an equal say and are 
treated fairly and equally across 
the board.”

and students alike, is Engler’s lack 
of academic credentials. 

Students also worry Engler’s 

politician 
status 
will 
cause 

conflict on MSU’s already divided 
campus. At this meeting, Ashley 
Fuente, the president of the MSU 
Council of Graduate Studies, 
expressed this fear. “The damage 
that can be caused by appointing a 
politician on an already polarized 
campus is catastrophic,” she said 
to Fox News. “Engler has passed 
legislation in the past that are 
in direct conflict with our core 

values of inclusion.”

Dan Martel, president of the 

MSU Democrats, feels similarly, 
taking 
issue 
especially 
with 

Engler’s conservative views.

“For the rest of my life I will 

carry a diploma from Larry 
Nassar University, and it will be 
signed by somebody who is so 
conservative that they have been 
handpicked to chair the national 
education assessment board by 
Betsy DeVos,” Martel said to 
Michigan Radio. 

Different 
departments 
of 

majors at MSU are coming 
together 
to 
hold 
town 
hall 

meetings in order to discuss 
apprehensions 
and 
ways 
to 

progress during this tumultuous 
time. In an email obtained by 
The Daily from Interim Dean of 
the Natural Science department 
Cheryl Sisk to her department, she 
describes the purpose of the town 
hall and encourages students to 
come together.

“The Town Hall will provide 

the opportunity for me to hear 
from you, the NatSci student body, 
about how you are feeling and what 
you are experiencing, as well as to 
provide updates on conversations 
and activities taking place at the 
college and university levels, and 
to get your thoughts and ideas on 
meaningful and effective ways to 
move forward,” she wrote.

one that is most likely to cause 
the complications, and (the virus 
is) the one that our vaccine is 
least effective against,” he said.

In 
order 
to 
create 
the 

vaccination, scientists look at data 
from countries in the southern 
hemisphere to predict which flu 
variants will be common during 
our flu season. This year, those 
predictions were less accurate, 
making 
for 
a 
less 
effective 

vaccination.

Still, Howard Saulles, interim 

executive 
director 
of 
UHS, 

explained it is still important 
to get vaccinated, especially for 
students, who tend to be at a 
higher risk for the virus. 

“Students tend to live in fairly 

close confines, which puts people 

at greater risks because it’s easier 
to spread germs and viruses, so 
students need to take a little bit 
better care of themselves than 
the general population,” Saulles 
said. “They really should be 
getting vaccinated for the flu, 
even though it may not be the best 
match of the vaccine.”

In order to avoid contracting 

the 
flu, 
Saulles 
encourages 

students to live healthy lifestyles 
in addition to getting vaccinated.

“Getting as much sleep as you 

can, eating properly, these are all 
things that can help the body’s 
immune system fight off these 
viruses,” he said.

Kinesiology 
junior 
Kayla 

Keane said she did not receive her 
flu shot this year.

“I do not plan on getting the 

flu shot, because I heard it wasn’t 
very effective this year,” she said. 
“It’s just not one of my priorities.”

Perhaps as a result, Keane 

said she contracted the flu 
several weeks ago. She has 
since recovered, and suspects 
she contracted the flu spending 
time in the University’s crowded 
public spaces.

“I’ve 
always 
been 
pretty 

good about washing my hands 
and everything, I just feel like 
it’s really hard when you’re in 
public places all the time,” she 
said. “Like if you go to the UGLi, 
people are just pretty nasty.

Monto’s vision for the future 

entails creating a new vaccination. 
This would potentially involve 
creating a vaccine that does not 
need to be updated when the 
strain of the flu virus changes.

“The long-range goal would be 

to make what they call a universal 
vaccine, something that works 
forever, and takes some parts 
of the virus that don’t change 
and make those the target of the 
vaccine,” he said.

about 

Michigan

Simon, 
who 
resigned 

Jan. 24 after being accused of 
enabling sexual abuser Larry 
Nassar, was recently replaced 
by 
interim 
president 
John 

Engler.

According to Wilson, Engler 

was “one of the first governors 
in Michigan to decrease higher 
education state appropriations 
… a lot of people are upset about 
it.”

Wilson asked LSA SG to pay 

attention to the controversy. 

“I’m sure a lot of you know 

people that go to Michigan 
State,” Wilson said. “So … I 
think it’s good if we all keep 
up to date and if we can help 
to inform our fellow students 
about what’s going on at other 
Big Ten universities.”

M

y goal is not to meet 
the love of my life 
until I am at least 26. 
 

That will give me two years after 
I complete my undergraduate 
degree 
to 
work 
somewhere 

abroad, building my resume and 
establishing connections. After 
that, I will still have two years to 
come back to the United States and 
complete my master’s degree. Then 
my future husband can come into 
the picture, though he will have 
to wait at least five years after that 
before having kids, to give me time 
to establish my career.

This is a common dinner table 

conversation 
among 
my 
four 

female roommates and me. We all 
hope to have families someday — I, 
in particular, grew up in a family 
with four kids and have always 
wanted to have at least that many 
myself. But my roommates and I 
stay at the library until the early 
hours of the morning multiple 
times a week and run ourselves 
dry with extracurriculars in hopes 
that the additions to our LinkedIn 
profiles will be the deciding factor 
for our future employers. So, 
though our bodies crave the idea of 
falling in love and raising a family, 
the idea terrifies us more than it 
excites us. We don’t want to give up 
the prospect of the careers we’re 
working so hard for, but we also 
don’t want to be that stereotypical 
working mom who leaves her kids 
in a nursery all day. We are aware 
that there will come a day when we 
have to choose between the joy of 
motherhood and the satisfaction of 
moving up in the workplace.

In these conversations, my 

roommates and I overlook two 
critical points. The first is that the 
only reason we face this dilemma is 
our gender. Our male friends have 
yet to consider at what age they 
want to get married and have kids. 
For women, this is a natural part of 
the conversation in college because 
it pertains directly to their future 
careers. For men, however, the 
potential of fatherhood is distinctly 
unrelated to the workplace. We 
live in a culture in which men can 
safely assume that being a “good 
father” will in no way conflict with 
their career goals.

There are ways that companies 

can mitigate the sexism that keeps 
mothers 
and 
future 
mothers 

from 
pursuing 
careers. 
Her 

Campus Media, one of the top 
media brands targeted at college 
women, recently took a public 

stance on its support for female 
employees by announcing that it is 
a Business for Birth Control. This 
means that, despite recent White 
House regulations that allow any 
employer to deny its employees 
birth control coverage under the 
Affordable Care Act, Her Campus 
Media will continue to cover birth 
control for its employees.

“As a company whose every cell 

is about supporting, empowering, 
and lifting up women, we knew that 
making this kind of commitment to 
our employees was a no-brainer,” 
Stephanie Kaplan Lewis, CEO and 
Editor in Chief of Her Campus, 
wrote me in an email.

Lewis notes that providing 

access to birth control is not 
the only way a company can 
foster a more gender-equitable 
office culture.

“We offer our team members 

exceptional flexibility in their 
schedules as well as the ability to 
work from home some or all of the 
time, depending on the role...We 
also offer unlimited personal, sick 
and vacation days,” she said.

These 
policies 
reduce 
the 

necessity for a woman to choose 
between work and motherhood, 
as she knows that she can make 
family 
a 
top 
priority 
while 

continuing to move up in her 
career. This leads into the second 
point that my roommates and 
I overlooked during our dinner 
table conversations: We are not the 
only ones who would suffer if our 
desires for motherhood were to 
force us out of the workplace. We 
are all intelligent, savvy women 
with strong work ethics and 
unique perspectives that would 
provide innumerable benefits to 
any company where we choose to 
work. If a company’s office culture 
leaves us feeling that we are 
unwanted because of our desires 
to raise families someday, then that 
company is missing out not only on 
my roommates and me, but on the 
millions of young women across 
the country who want to both work 
and raise a family.

The founders of Her Campus 

Media (Lewis, along with former 
Harvard classmates Annie Wang 
and Windsor Hanger Western), 
were recently named to Forbes 
40 Under 40. To me, it comes as 
no surprise that a company with 
a commitment to gender equity 
would see such success. As Lewis 
states, “We have a number of 
employees who are moms of young 

children and left their former 
employers to come work at Her 
Campus because they saw that 
our flexible policies enable them 
to fulfill their career ambitions 
while also accommodating and 
encouraging their family ambitions 
at the same time.”

She 
elaborates 
on 
this, 

explaining, “Having policies that 
support 
women 
and 
families 

enable us to hire the very best 
talent, regardless of where they 
live or what their personal time 
constraints may be, and this is 
talent that employers with stricter 
policies are missing out on or even 
pushing out.”

As a University of Michigan 

student, 
this 
makes 
perfect 

sense to me. College is one place 
in our culture in which women 
consistently 
outperform 
men, 

even though men tend to do 
better as soon as we enter the 
workplace. Every day I’m able to 
see the valuable contributions that 
women bring to every aspect of 
the University: class discussions, 
leadership roles, group projects. 
The men here are all thoughtful 
and intelligent, too, of course, but 
I can’t even imagine how much 
this University would suffer if it 
were to lose the perspective and 
hard work of women. Yet, that’s 
just what much of the corporate 
sector of the United States is: a lot 
of intelligent, thoughtful people, 
but devoid of women.

My roommates and I will be 

assets to any company where we 
choose to work, so why is it so rare 
to find a company that recognizes 
this the way Her Campus Media 
does? There are several years 
before I enter the workforce. 
Perhaps Her Campus Media’s 
policies 
are 
foreshadowing 

those that will be the norm in 
just a few years. Perhaps I can 
hold out hope that by the time 
I 
graduate, 
companies 
will 

promote 
a 
gender-equitable 

workplace 
environment 
in 

which motherhood is seen as just 
as unrelated to career success 
as fatherhood is. If so, both the 
company I work for and I will 
benefit. If not, the workplace 
is missing out on countless 
hardworking, 
intelligent 

women — and that loss is to 
everybody’s detriment.

F

ormer Secretary of State 
John Kerry surprised a 
lot of people last week, 

starting 
with 
his 
translator 

in a conversation with a high-
ranking 
Palestinian 
official. 

Despite his absence on the 
national political stage for the 
past year, he readily admitted 
“he was seriously considering 
running for president in 2020.” 
On paper, not many other 
Democratic 
hopefuls 
could 

hold a candle to this multi-term 
senator, former secretary of state 
and decorated war hero with 
three Purple Hearts who almost 
ousted George W. Bush in the 
2004 election.

Not many who reported this 

news took that angle, though. 
Most focused on the fact that 
John Kerry is 74, and his entrance 
into the race would push the 
average age in the Democratic 
field even higher. While this 
is something that should be 
taken into consideration, the 
discussion on age currently 
dominating 
columns 
and 

2020 speculation needs to be 
toned way down in the search 
for a challenger to President 
Donald Trump.

It does not take long to 

recognize 
the 
common 

denominator 
between 
these 

Democratic 
candidates. 
Sen. 

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would 
be 79 should he assume the 
presidency, and former Vice 
President Joe Biden would be 
77. By comparison, Kerry would 
be a spry 76 and Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass, the kid of the 
group, would be 71. This is all 
in comparison to Trump, who 
would be 74.

At first glance, one wonders 

why the party of progress 
would struggle to recruit a 
candidate who was born more 
recently than the Eisenhower 

administration. What happened 
to the youthful energy of Obama 
‘08 and even Clinton ‘92? Both 
campaigned and assumed office 
in their late 40s.

These 
concerns 
are 

understandable, 
given 
the 

questions about our current 
commander in chief’s health, 
from heart fitness to dementia to 
poor dieting. Everyone has seen 
those comparisons of presidents 
before and after their eight years 
in office: grayer, tired, worn 
down. For some, the legacy of 
former President Ronald Reagan 
is that of an elder statesman 
with 
Alzheimer’s 
disease, 

having trouble getting through 
meetings and using jelly beans 
to quit smoking. Applying for 
arguably the most stressful job 
in the world warrants a level of 
scrutiny as to whether or not 
one can handle it physically 
and mentally. Age certainly 
plays a part in this. But it’s not 
the whole story.

For one, I know 70- and 

80-year-olds who are more 
sound of mind and have better 
blood pressure than certain 
30- 
and 
40-year-olds. 
My 

grandfather could give you 
the address of the dealership 
where he bought his first car 
and who played left field for the 
1962 New York Yankees. I am 
struggling to remember what 
I ate for dinner two days ago. 
These things are not linear. 
Not every presidential candidate 
operates with “McDonald’s, KFC, 
pizza and Diet Coke” as their 
major food groups. Not everyone 
above 70 has delusions of grandeur, 
and many of these articles come 
dangerously close to implying 
some of these 1-to-1 connections.

The 
first 
question 
that 

every party donor, reporter, 
Democratic primary voter and 
potential 
candidate 
should 

be asking is whether or not 
that person could successfully 
articulate an argument. Can 
their message resonate with the 
people? Are they in tune with 
our society? Can they win?

Then ask the questions about 

age and hair color and Twitter 
presence. Liberals played into 
enough of this nonsense in 2016, 
asking Hillary Clinton to dab 
on Ellen and then laughing at 
her for being awkward when 
she did. Democrats need to stop 
caring about this nonsense. 
An 
octogenarian 
statesman 

and a middle-aged insurgent 
challenger are ultimately held 
to the same standard in terms 
of their ideas and their policies. 
Sanders may be, and probably is, 
more able to energize younger 
voters than Cory Booker.

Perhaps this early polling 

speaks to what the Democratic 
party 
needs 
right 
now 
— 

experience, gravitas. The ideal 
candidate might be Warren or 
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., 
or it might be “Grandpa Joe” 
— there is no age limit on the 
ability to have good ideas or 
serve the public well. 84-year-
old Supreme Court Associate 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 
her daily workout routine should 
be enough evidence of this.

Democrats, stop disqualifying 

candidates. 
Take 
a 
breath. 

Forgive the irony, but stop eating 
your young. Decide on a message, 
a feeling, what you want out of 
a candidate before you narrow 
the field. Furthermore, realize 
that if you ask candidates who 
are above the age of 60 to start 
jockeying for position as the 
most “vibrant” or “youthful,” 
you are asking to be deceived.

Aging Democratic field for 2020

BRETT GRAHAM| COLUMN

D

oes sexual harassment 
truly merit professional 
decapitation? 
That’s 

what NYTimes columnist Bret 
Stephens wants to know. As does 
Matt Damon. And apparently, 
according to New Yorker writer Jia 
Tolentino, it’s besieging her own 
medial specialist’s conscience. I 
wonder what skeletons he’s got in 
his closet.

From the moment the Harvey 

Weinstein effect took its full 
force, the #MeToo movement 
has become subject to scrutiny 
that feels almost as significant 
as the campaign against sexual 
misconduct itself.

Critics of the movement have 

targeted the perceived inability to 
discern between varying degrees 
of assault as the crux of aspects 
that are wrong with the fewer than 
five-month-old crusade to resolve 
the dismal state of sexual attitudes. 
A force for change that is barely in 
its infancy has already managed 
to draw detractors, especially as 
assailants, mostly men, continue to 
face this reckoning.

Why are people, specifically 

but not solely men, unable to 
thoughtfully participate in the 
conversation? 
When 
women 

leave a sexual experience feeling 
violated, assaulted or just simply 
in tears — even if the sex itself 
may seem to have been within a 
grey area of consent — isn’t the 
conversation important to have?

When Babe.net published the 

piece “I went on a date with Aziz 
Ansari. It was the worst night of 
my life,” a back and forth erupted 
over the sexual encounter and 
whether it exhibited aspects of 
assault or if Ansari was just the 
target of angry women (because 
weaponizing a woman’s anger is 
significantly easier than actually 
engaging it).

Reading 
the 
Babe 
article 

alongside 
the 
articles 
that 

inevitably came with it felt like 

taking a masterclass on how 
to misconstrue a movement. It 
was an immediate attempt to 
disengage with the concerns 
of millennial women without 
properly shedding light on such 
embedded dynamics.

The 
strongest 
criticism 
of 

“Grace,” the victim of Ansari’s 
sexual misconduct, was that she 
was unable to assume agency 
within the situation. Why didn’t 
she just get up and leave?

The lesson of #MeToo, from 

the perspective of a cisgendered 
man, 
is 
a 
commitment 
to 

listening to each story of sexual 
misconduct. 
Grey 
areas 
that 

have been emerging shouldn’t be 
bleached out by men who claim 
to understand them just as well as 
the women who experience them.

Men such as Damon are being 

horrible listeners at a time when 
listening is crucial. It would do 
critics well not to dismiss claims 
of harassment by asking “Has 
#MeToo gone too far?” especially 
when the movement itself still 
has not exhibited whether the 
ramifications 
of 
harassment 

(especially those acts in the grey 
area) will actually last.

In 
recent 
months, 
the 

conversation has grown along with 
the chorus of critics. In December, 
the New Yorker published Kristen 
Roupenian’s short fiction piece 
“Cat Person,” a story that drew on 
the worst date imaginable — and, 
more disconcertingly, a date that 
many women go on over and over 
again.

One of the most cited scenes 

is the one in which the two 
characters, at the end of their 
dismally awkward date, have 
a sexual encounter that lacks 
affirmative consent and, in some 
capacity, 
fringes 
on 
assault. 

Many women have described this 
scene as harrowingly familiar, 
while men (though not all men) 
have decried it an innocuous, 

consensual encounter.

I would describe the experience 

of reading such a skin-crawling, 
unrelentingly horrific story, but 
doing so would detract from the 
voices of women who know such 
gruesomeness on a personal level. 
 
 

How do men feel, then, that they 

can provide salient feedback on an 
experience that is completely out 
of their realm? This is not to say 
that Roupenian’s story shouldn’t 
yield criticism from a literary 
standpoint, but most of the male 
objection doesn’t come from such 
an earnest place. 

With the laudatory reception 

from women came a swift and 
blunt backlash from men who 
defended the actions of the man 
in the story, Robert, and indicted 
those of the woman, Margot.

Of 
course, 
the 
warped 

conventions 
of 
sexual 

encounters 
have 
become 

so 
normalized 
that 
any 

conversation saying otherwise 
is a target for resentment by 
those who perpetuate such 
lopsided dynamics.

Thus, the criticism veers into a 

territory that begins eliminating 
the conversation of sexual politics. 
This infringes on one’s right to 
express 
discontent 
with 
this 

wholly unbalanced dynamic.

Dismissing a movement still 

somewhat in its inception by 
weaponizing the voices of its 
heralders does nothing to add to 
the conversation.

Women 
likely 
understand 

the difference between sexual 
harassment and assault, especially 
considering 
how 
many 
have 

withstood both. Discourse that 
actually 
promotes 
enriching 

discussion rather than positing 
women as “agentless” could yield 
a culture that balances the skewed 
nature of sexual politics.

Men have to listen to #MeToo

Knight, Wolverines split weekend contests at ITA kick-off

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team failed to qualify for the 
ITA 
National 
Team 
Indoor 

Championship, despite a stellar 
performance from their knight in 
shining armor.

Senior Alex Knight that is, 

with his shining armor being the 
Michigan tennis gear he donned 
in Chapel Hill, NC Saturday and 
Sunday, where he upset North 
Carolina’s No. 3-ranked William 
Blumberg in a three set thriller, 
6-4, 3-6, 6-1. But his efforts proved 
to be insufficient against No. 3 
North Carolina.

The No. 17 Wolverines (3-1) 

split their ITA kick-off duals this 
weekend, sweeping No. 20 South 
Carolina 
(5-1), 
4-0, 
Saturday 

morning, before falling to the host 
Tar Heels (5-0), 4-2, the following 
afternoon.

Although the team failed to 

reach their goal of qualifying for 
the ITA National Team Indoor 
Championship, they found a silver 
lining in their performance.

“We got a win over a great 

South Carolina team, and that’s a 
win we definitely needed,” Knight 
said.

Against 
the 
Gamecocks, 

Michigan dictated the pace of 
play, won with ease, and advanced 
into the tournament’s finals. As 
expected though, the next dual 
against the Tar Heels proved to be 

more difficult.

“We had an opportunity to 

knock off the No. 3-ranked team 
in the country and we came close,” 
Knight said. “We beat a guy who 
was up a break in the third and 
we had a few other guys who had 
some close matches so we built 
some confidence and it showed 
that we can play with anyone in 
the country.”

And Knight showcased that 

confidence 
Sunday 
against 

Blumberg. After playing each 
other neck-and-neck the first two 
sets, Knight pulled away in the 
final set by staying resilient and 
sticking to his gameplan.

“I just kept playing my game 

and looking for it,” Knight said. “I 
had opportunities in the second 
and I knew that if I kept on it I’d 
have chances to win.”

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, their other singles 
players 
didn’t 
fare 
as 
well, 

exemplified by senior No. 20 
Runhao 
Hua 
falling 
to 
the 

unranked 
Benjamin 
Sigouin 

of North Carolina. Aside from 
Knight, no other Michigan player 
won a singles match.

A bright spot for the Wolverines 

was their doubles play — thanks 
again in part to Knight. He and 
his partner, Hua, rolled to a 6-4 
set victory on Sunday, and were 
on the path to winning Saturday 
before their match was cut short, 
as their teammates had already 
secured a doubles victory.

Michigan’s 
chemistry 
was 

evident all weekend, as the 
squad took the doubles point 
in both duals. For the team, its 
camaraderie is a result of its 

behind the scenes work in the 
preseason.

“This team has worked harder 

than any team I’ve been on in my 
five years here at Michigan, and 

all the work we put in is showing,” 
Knight said. “But we’re not there 
yet. And the good thing is we 
know that.”

And 
following 
the 
singles 

performance on Sunday in which 
the Wolverines could only claim 
one victory, they will be hard at 
work preparing for the long season 
ahead.

Michigan carries on tradition of Pink Game

On Thursday, the No. 13 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team will host Purdue in the 
program’s annual “Pink Game.”

The Wolverines will wear 

white jerseys with pink trim, 
and the players and coaching 
staff will sport pink shoes as 
well. This annual tradition was 
created to raise awareness for 
breast cancer and celebrate 
breast cancer survivors.

“That 
was 
something 

that our marketing team, in 
conjunction with our coaching 
staff, 
implemented 
when 
I 

first got here six years ago,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico to WTKA. “It’s a 
wonderful, wonderful event.”

On Jan. 21, the Wolverines 

met and had dinner with a 
group of breast cancer survivors 
to discuss the importance of 
self-care and of being a health 
advocate.

“We actually have about five 

or six breast survivors every 
year come in and meet with our 
team and have dinner with our 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
break up into groups and we get 
to know them and we get to hear 

their stories. I think that it’s a 
great reminder to our players, 
and to our staff and everyone 
involved in our program, how 
fortunate we are and how truly 
blessed we are, but also that this 
can happen to anyone.”

Michigan (8-2 Big Ten, 19-4 

overall) is coming off a win on 
Sunday against Northwestern, 
and is in the midst of a six-game 
winning streak. The victory 
marked 
the 
third-longest 

winning streak in program 
history 
and 
Barnes 
Arico’s 

400th career win.

Barnes Arico attributes the 

Wolverines’ great success this 
season to the leadership of their 
upperclassmen.

“I 
think 
it’s 
our 
senior 

leadership 
and 
our 
junior 

class. Their maturity and their 
experience is really shining 
through 
and 
that’s 
Jillian 

Dunston and Katelynn Flaherty 
but also Hallie Thome and 
Nicole Munger,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They are really on a 
mission and they seem to play 
for Michigan every game and 
they don’t get caught up in the 
opponent.

“We obviously are prepared 

and we do our scouting and we 
are ready for the opponent, but 

it’s not about Northwestern or 
Purdue or Michigan State, they 
want to play the best Michigan 
basketball that they can play.”

Purdue (5-3, 14-8) is coming 

off a 88-73 win over Penn State 
on Sunday.

While 
the 
Boilermakers 

boast three double-digit scoring 
players in Andreona Keys (13.8 
ppg), Ae’Rianna Harris (13.0) 
and Dominique Oden (11.8), this 
trio of talented scorers will have 
to deal with the Wolverines’ 
stingy 
defense, 
ranked 
as 

the conference’s second-best 
scoring 
defense. 
Of 
course, 

Purdue isn’t so shabby either, 
boasting the Big Ten’s third-
best scoring defense — possibly 
hinting at a low-scoring slugfest.

“Purdue is a great program,” 

Barnes Arico said. “They’re a 
team that is year in and year out 
a NCAA tournament team, they 
have some great tradition and 
some great history. They’re a 
team that is improving as well.

“They’re playing with a lot 

of confidence, they’re going to 
come in here just a game behind 
us in the standings. They will be 
fired up, they will be excited for 
the opportunity to come in here 
and play us. It’s going to be a 
great game on Thursday night.”

Marody, ‘M’ headed for climactic ending

The year was 1994, and the New 

York Rangers unexpectedly trailed 
their rival New Jersey Devils in 
the NHL’s Eastern Conference 
Finals, 3-2. Legendary center Mark 
Messier netted three goals in the 
third period to send the series to a 
Game 7, and later to a Stanley Cup 
victory.

What does this have to do with 

Michigan hockey, you ask?

The Rangers were favored to 

win that series after an incredible 
regular season that saw them 
streaking to the playoffs, yet found 
themselves in dire straits with the 
entire year in jeopardy.

The No. 20 Michigan hockey 

team (7-9-2 Big Ten, 12-12-2 
overall) aren’t in such a dissimilar 
spot.

After two consecutive weekend 

sweeps 
against 
now-No.12 

Minnesota and No. 17 Penn State, 
it seemed the only way for the 
Wolverines to go was up.

Michigan 
finally 
found 
its 

starting goalkeeper in sophomore 
Hayden Lavigne, who was putting 
up monstrous numbers in front of 
the net, and it appeared that the 
front and back lines had finally 
clicked as a cohesive unit on both 
sides of the puck.

But the storyline has changed 

following two straight losses to 
then-No. 6 Ohio State, in which the 
Wolverines were systematically 

shut down.

Michigan 
experienced 
an 

abysmal 
weekend 
due 
to 
a 

lackluster power play, a defensive 
effort that simply wasn’t good 
enough and offensive stagnation.

“It’s obviously a bad feeling 

when you get swept,” said junior 
forward Cooper Marody. “I think 
there some things that we liked 
over the weekend, but Ohio State’s 
an incredible team and if you make 
one turnover, it’s gonna end up in 
the back of your net. So I think it 
was good for us to have that wake-
up call.”

But if Messier’s miracle can tell 

us anything, it’s that anything can 
happen, a fact the Wolverines are 
well aware of. 

“We still control our own 

destiny,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson.

He added: “Never get too high 

when you’re winning and you’re 
on a roll, and never too low when 
things don’t go your way. (And) 
you need to because you don’t have 
much time, we have to move on 
and prepare for Wisconsin.”

In the Wolverines’ rout of 

the Nittany Lions on Jan. 19, 
freshman forward Jack Becker 
scored twice, and junior forward 
Brendan Warren added a tally as 
well. Standout freshman forward 
Josh Norris also added onto the 
offensive effort with a goal.

The early Michigan offense 

revolved around Marody and 
seniors Tony Calderone and Dexter 

Dancs. While the trio continues to 
dominate statistically, the burden 
now lies on the rest of the players 
on the ice.

“It’s tough when people rely on 

people to score goals and it’s easy 
to think ‘Oh, they’re not playing 
well because they’re not scoring,’ 
” Marody said. “But sometimes the 
puck doesn’t go in the net and you’ll 
have a game where you might not 
earn the goals that you get, but you 
have three points at the end of the 
night.

“And some games you really 

think you earned it and you worked 
your butt off and had one of the 
best games, but you had no points. 
So that’s just how the game works.”

The Wolverines are clearly at 

the crux of their season. As Marody 
mentioned, all of Michigan’s lines 
are grinding on the ice for goals.

Sophomore defenseman Luke 

Martin, sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker and freshman forward 
Michael Pastujov all have the 
potential to be strong point-
generators.

In Happy Valley, Michigan 

saw what could happen when the 
whole 
team-offense 
mentality 

comes alive. After the Buckeyes, 
there now just seems to be a 
missing factor that will help the 
Wolverines mine those extra 
points from their non-headliner 
players.

And if they do strike gold, they 

just might have their Messier 
moment.

Former coach Berenson wins award

The accolades keep coming 

for Red Berenson.

After being honored with a 

formal rink dedication of the 
“Red Berenson Rink” at Yost 
Ice Arena earlier this month, 
the legendary former Michigan 
hockey coach — who retired at 
the end of last season — was 
named the 2018 Hobey Baker 
Legends of College Hockey 
Award recipient Tuesday.

The 
annual 
award 
is 

presented by the Hobey Baker 
Memorial Award Committee 
to honor “one of the all-time 
great contributors to the game 
of college hockey.”

And after three years as a 

Michigan varsity letterwinner 
and another 33 behind the 
Wolverines’ bench, Berenson’s 
accomplishments in Ann Arbor 
cemented him as one of those 
contributors.

The 
ultimate 
“Michigan 

man” since 1959, Berenson came 
from Regina, Saskatchewan and 

played four years of hockey for 
the Wolverines. The Canadian 
was named All-American twice, 
the 1962 WCHA Most Valuable 
Player and a team captain his 
senior season.

Berenson would go on to play 

17 years in the NHL as a member 
of the New York Rangers, St. 
Louis Blues, Detroit Red Wings 
and 
Montreal 

Canadiens 
— 

with 
which 

he 
won 
two 

Stanley Cups — 
and coached in 
the NHL until 
1984. He then 
returned to his 
alma mater as 
head coach and 
immediately 
rebuilt 
the 

Michigan hockey program into 
the storied one it is today.

With Berenson at the helm, 

the Wolverines captured 21 
conference 
championships 

and qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament in 23 of his last 
27 seasons. From 1991 to 2012, 

Michigan made 22 straight 
tournaments, an NCAA record 
that still stands. Berenson led 
the Wolverines to 11 Frozen 
Fours 
and 
two 
national 

championships, in 1996 and 
1998.

Berenson retired with the 

fourth-most wins in NCAA 
hockey history with an 848-

426-92 
career 

record. He also 
groomed 
two 

Hobey 
Baker 

Memorial 
Award winners, 
73 
NHL 

players 
and 

140 
Academic 

All-Big 
Ten 

selections.

Berenson will 

be honored on 

May 28 in St. Paul, Minn., at 
the annual Hobey Baker Award 
Banquet. He becomes the third 
Michigan coach to be named an 
honoree, following Vic Heyliger 
and Al Renfrew, who were 
inductees in 1982 and 1990, 
respectively.

Ian 
Bunting 
announced 

Tuesday 
night 
that 
he 
is 

pursuing a grad transfer.

The fifth-year senior tight 

end was once seen as the heir 
apparent to Jake Butt. Now, 
he’ll finish his college career 
elsewhere.

“This 
has 
been 
a 
very 

difficult decision, but I have 
decided to forgo my 5th year at 
the University of Michigan in 
order to play football and earn 
a graduate degree elsewhere,” 
Bunting wrote on Instagram. “I 
have obtained my release. … This 
place will always be a special 
one for me and it has been the 
opportunity of a lifetime.”

As 
a 
graduate 
transfer, 

Bunting will be immediately 
eligible for whichever program 
he joins. He ends his four-year 
career at Michigan with 11 
catches for 124 yards. 

The 
6-foot-7, 
252-pounder 

isn’t the first member of his 
class to leave the program. 
Quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

and receivers Drake Harris and 

Moe Ways will also play their 
final year elsewhere, having 
announced their intentions to 
do so earlier this offseason. The 
Wolverines have also brought in 
a grad transfer of their own in 
former Utah cornerback Casey 
Hughes.

A 
highly-touted 
four-star 

recruit with offers from Florida 
State, Notre Dame, Ohio State 
and Oklahoma, among others, 
Bunting 
never 
completely 

developed into the weapon many 
originally envisioned him as.

After 
redshirting 
his 

freshman year, he found the field 
as a backup tight end during Jim 
Harbaugh’s first season in Ann 
Arbor. In the first four games, 
Bunting caught four passes for 
55 yards. But he didn’t record a 
catch over the following eight 
games.

With the return of Butt, an 

All-American in 2015, Bunting 
once again saw limited time as 
a redshirt sophomore during 
the 2016-17 season. Through the 
first 12 games of the season, he 
recorded just two catches for six 
yards.

Yet when Butt suffered a torn 

right ACL in the second quarter 
of the Orange Bowl, it was 
the seldom-used Bunting who 
stepped into the Mackey Award 
winner’s absence. He would 
finish the game with three 
catches for 40 yards, including 
a 21-yard reception on a crucial 
fourth down in the second half.

Bunting’s 
breakout 

performance in the bowl game 
was seen as a harbinger of 
future success. He entered 2017 
as the most experienced and 
most productive tight end on 
Michigan’s roster. But Bunting 
couldn’t hold off younger players 
such as redshirt freshman Sean 
McKeon and redshirt sophomore 
Zach Gentry. The pair surged 
ahead of Bunting on the depth 
chart, finishing the season with 
a combined 48 catches for 604 
yards and five touchdowns. 
Bunting, meanwhile, had one 
catch for six yards. 

Bunting’s 
transfer 
leaves 

the 
Wolverines 
with 
four 

scholarship tight ends on the 
roster. 
Four-star 
Mustapha 

Muhammad and three-star Luke 
Schoonmaker are set to enroll 
this summer.

Former Michigan coach Red Berenson was named the recipient of the 2018 Hobey Baker Legends Award.

Berenson will 
be honored on 
May 28 in St. 
Paul, Minn.

With his play, ‘The Microwave’ Poole seeking to expand role

Jordan Poole is comfortable in 

his role.

He calls himself — and insists 

others in the locker room also 
call him — “The Microwave.” As 
such, Poole serves as an offensive 
sparkplug off the bench. When 
the offense needs creativity, 
assertion or sure shooting, Poole 
can provide just that. It’s a role 
that suits his game as much as 
his gregarious personality.

“People go to me for the ‘hype 

guy,’ ” Poole said. “Me personally, 
I feel like if I hit one, I’m hot.”

At 
Mackey 
Arena 
last 

Thursday, with an explosive 
Purdue offense beginning to 
impose its will while Michigan’s 
passive offense sputtered ever-
so-slightly, 
the 
Wolverines 

needed a spark. In a game that 
would eventually produce 180 
points, any offensive lull could 
be a death blow. 

As Purdue regained the lead, 

14-12, with a quick 6-0 spurt, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
inserted the freshman guard.

On his first possession, Poole 

received the ball on a simple 
handoff, took three dribbles to 
his right, stepped back to gain 
separation and elevated for a 
mid-range jumper to tie the 
game up. On the defensive end, 
Poole attacked the weak dribble 
of forward Grady Eifert, diving 
on the floor to force a turnover. 
He got up, darted for the 
corner and drained a transition 
3-pointer.

In less time than it takes to 

pop a bag of popcorn, Poole had 
blitzed the Boilermakers and 
snagged the lead back.

Microwave 
on. 
Mackey 

silenced. 

He did it against Indiana, 

notching 19 points and taking 
almost as many shots (10) as he 
had in the season to date (14). He 

did it against Illinois, draining 
consecutive threes to stretch the 
second half lead and totaling 11 
points in an ugly game Michigan 
had to grind out. He did it 
against Maryland, sparking a 
furious comeback with three 
3-pointers in a two minute span 
in the second half, and inciting 
the loudest eruption at Crisler 
Center all season.

This has been Poole’s role not 

only the majority of this season, 
but even dating back to his 
senior year of high school, when 
Poole was the sixth man for his 
prep school at La Lumiere.

That role helped ease the 

transition to college, where he 
knew playing time would be 
hard to come by at first.

“I’m glad it happened last 

year,” Poole said. “If I was 
starting all four years — or three 
years in a row — in high school, 
then came here and not started, 
it could have been a confidence 

breaker.” 

Poole, of course, isn’t devoid 

of confidence. 

This season, he has clearly 

identified a niche as a bench 
scorer, and has evolved into a 
valuable one at that. He scores 
.58 points per minute, the best 
on 
the 
team. 

Despite 
that, 

Poole plays just 
11.0 minutes per 
game, ninth on 
the team.

“I’m more of 

a, ‘Try to come 
in and make an 
impact and win 
the game.’ That’s 
how I am,” Poole 
said 
Monday 

regarding his role. “Obviously, I 
want the best for the team.”

But while Poole has thrived 

in his role so far, this team 
needs him to be more. What was 
best for the team in November 
— when Poole was collecting 
DNPs — may no longer be what’s 

best now and into March.

Much of what held him 

back 
early 
in 
the 
season 

revolved around his defensive 
consistency and shot selection, 
skills that Beilein now considers 
to be much improved. 

“Jordan 
Poole’s 
defense, 

right 
now 
— 

and it was not 
good in October, 
November — it 
is really coming 
on,” Beilein said 
Monday 
night. 

“He’s a pretty 
bright kid, and 
he 
gets 
that. 

And 
he 
also 

understands, 
‘I’m going to play 

defense and I’m going to take 
care of the ball or I’m not going 
to play.’ ”

Finding 
minutes 
for 

the 
freshman 
can 
be 
a 

tricky 
predicament. 
Senior 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore Charles Matthews 
are 
firmly 
entrenched 
in 

the starting wing spots, the 
two positions Poole can play 
offensively. There have been 
brief attempts to play Abdur-
Rahkman at point guard and 
slide Poole next to him. There 
may even be opportunities — 
in certain matchups — to play 
Matthews at forward next to 
junior center Moritz Wagner, 
slotting Poole into the other 
wing position. 

That Beilein is even willing 

to maneuver the rotation to 
account for Poole’s emergence, 
though, signals the importance 
of his skillset. For a team lacking 
offensive assertion — one that 
has scored 62 points or fewer in 
three of its last four games and 
is on pace for its second worst 
adjusted 
offensive 
efficiency 

since 2010 — Poole can be a 
difference-maker.

“You can see,” Beilein said, 

“he just does things that you 
can’t teach.”

the same sense of belonging as 
others. A lot of the consternation 
that this campus has seen 
surrounding race, gender and 
identity in recent months has led 
many students to grapple with 
their identities in ways they 
never have before. “MVisible 
Voices” is about taking these 
experiences and these identity 
conflicts and moving them to the 
very center of the conversation 
instead of pushing them to 
the periphery. These stories 
are just as much a part of the 
history of this University as the 
narratives that we hear more 
often. Through her work, James 
explores being a minority on this 
campus and how as a community 
we can welcome all people into 
the broader conversation about 
what it means to be a Wolverine, 
and in a bigger sense, what it 
means to be human.
James hopes to take the 
podcast further than just a 
bicentennial event, as it has seen 
much success. She laid out a plan 
for Season Two of the podcast. 
She hopes to take it a step 
further, explore new issues and 
open it up to more minorities 
who were not explored in the 
first podcast. She says she’d like 
to further explore the Native 
American culture and identity 
on the campus, as well as the 
issues surrounding gender and 
sexuality.
“There are continuously going 
to be untold stories that we can 
discover and lift up,” she said.
In addition to the podcast, 
James has brought the “Value 
the 
Voice” 
event 
to 
the 
University campus. In junction 
with the Comprehensive Studies 
Program, James helped to create 
a live storytelling series. It is 
described as a more casual and 
off-the-cuff TED Talk, with an 
emphasis on culture and the 
learned life lessons. The series 
has had three installments thus 
far (in Sept., Nov. and Jan.), with 
a final one coming in March. 
James describes it as a sacred 
space, and spoke to the wide 
spectrum of stories that were 
told at the most recent of the 
three events held so far.
“One girl told the story of 
her mother and sister dying in a 
house fire, someone else told the 
story of nobody knowing they 
have MS (multiple sclerosis), 
another 
of 
her 
experiences 
abroad,” she explained. James 
herself told the story of the first 
time she saw a naked man, which 
was in a West Quad Residence 
Hall girl’s bathroom during 
her undergraduate years, when 
a man had stumbled in there 
drunk and passed out naked.
“That story is real, and it’s 
relatable,” she said with a laugh.
She has also been recently 
exploring the way storytelling 
is evolving and changing with 
the times. When she began, 
storytelling was all done live 
and not written. In her early 
storytelling career, many people 
began transcribing and posting 
stories; 
however, 
now 
most 
storytellers have reverted back 
to the old ways of storytelling — 
simple and spoken. Additionally, 
James speaks on the world of 
social media, and how that has 
played a role in the world of 
storytelling.
“It’s funny actually. I had a 
student download Snapchat on 
my phone because I wanted to 
have my own Snapchat story 
— it’s a new way of telling 
stories,” she said. “Storytelling 
is changing.”

James does not seem fazed 
or nervous about these changes 
in storytelling that come with 
the times. Rather, she is excited 
and motivated for where this 
could potentially take her as 
a storyteller. At the base of all 
of the organizing she has done 
to bring cultural storytelling 
to this campus is her original 
passion: storytelling.
James has become a well-
known 
storyteller 
both 
in 
Mich and beyond. Besides her 
mother and grandmother, who 
are both her biggest mentors 

when it comes to storytelling, 
we spoke a lot about two other 
people who have really shaped 
her perception of storytelling 
and how it ties into culture. The 
first, mythology writer Joseph 
Campbell, has really shaped her 
perception of the foundation of 
storytelling. His work speaks on 
human experiences and religion. 
He also introduced James into 
the idea of the “Hero’s Journey.” 
The “Hero’s Journey” is the 
template of a tale in which a 
hero embarks on a journey, 
and, after some form of crisis, 
wins a victory and then returns 
transformed in some way.
“I use the Hero’s Journey 
as a guideline so often in my 
life, especially when I’m just 
speaking with students,” James 
said. “I always explain it’s sort 
of like the freshman/senior 
narrative, and how you change 
so much just in your four years 
of school here.”
The 
second 
of 
her 
two 
mentors is Jackie Torrence, 
who is otherwise known as the 
Story Lady. Torrence has told 
wonderful stories of the South 
for many years, with extremely 
animated facial expressions — 
something that James often tries 
to tie into her own storytelling, 
especially when speaking with 
kids. These two mentors, along 
with her family, have been the 
people James has looked to 
for guidance throughout her 
storytelling journey.
In addition to all her work 
here, James has told stories 
around the country and will 
continue to do so going forward. 
She is infatuated with the idea of 
storytelling for youth audiences. 
When asking James about why 
she is drawn to young audiences 
when telling stories, she tells 
of the magic in telling children 
stories and watching them want 
to pass them on.
“When I tell stories to young 
children, I can change my 
voice 
to 
highlight 
different 
characters, and they go crazy for 
it,” she said. “When I’m ready 
to leave, I’ll hear them talking 
to one another using the voices 
I just performed with, and it’s 
such a positive way to give to 
that generation and hope they 
become hooked on storytelling 

too.”
She has also gave a TED talk 
in Dec. at the University of 
Maryland, where she was invited 
to speak. Being one who did not 
much believe in storytelling that 
is recorded or rehearsed, she 
originally wanted to refuse the 
offer. However, after speaking 
with the TED team in Maryland 
and realizing what an honor 
it would be to speak there, she 
could not turn it down. In the 
TED talk, titled “What’s your 
Story?,” James talks about how 
to use storytelling to achieve 
one’s life goals and destiny.
“I ended up really enjoying 
that experience,” she said. “At 
the end of it all, in any form, 
storytelling is me and you, and 
we’re having this moment and 
sharing it with each other.”
In addition to this, she is 
currently working on a story 
she will be telling at Indiana 
University. It is an updated 
story from the Yoruba people 
of Nigeria, which speaks of 
the Goddess of Fresh Water. 
However, she has worked to 
update it to talk about the Flint 
water crisis and the Native 
American oil spill — constantly 
joining past narratives with 
the present day.
“This isn’t gone, you know? 
This story has so much history, 
but it’s still here with us,” she 
said. “Stories are so much about 
the past, but we can always 
take them to the future.”
The piece will be set to a 
dance, 
which 
incorporates 
other mediums of art, such as 
music and visual elements. She 
will be performing the piece 
with jazz artists, and the dance 
ensemble is comprised entirely 
of 
white 
performers 
who 
have been working to learn 
traditional Yoruba movement.
“Black dancers have always 
had to learn ballet — so why 
shouldn’t these white dancers 
have to step out of their 
comfort zone and learn about 
(a) different culture’s dancing 
styles?” she said.
She is also looking forward 
to the traditional Nigerian garb 
the staff at Indiana University 
has had made for her, which 
includes a beautiful headpiece 
and 
intricate 
decorations. 
The 
ability 
of 
storytelling 
to take the form of an entire 
performance is both exciting 
and innovating, and she hopes 
it 
will 
captivate 
audiences 
as much as it has already 
captivated her.

James’s 
storytelling 

experience has been unique 
and not without struggle. At 
the end of the day though, she 
would not change a thing. She 
has grown and changed in her 
years as a storyteller and hopes 
to continue to inspire, teach 
and grow as she continues to 
tell stories. As a storyteller, 
she 
is 
constantly 
brought 
back to her roots — the ones 
that began to grow from her 
kitchen with her grandmother, 
telling 
stories 
about 
their 
family’s culture and heritage. 
From there she has been able 
to celebrate and commemorate 
her culture through telling 
stories, and hopes to inspire 
many to do the same. 
“At our essence, people are 
good and we want to be happy,” 
she said. She paused, letting 
her words settle around me. 
“At the center of it all, we’re 
all just made for goodness. And 
that’s what I hope to convey 
when I tell stories.”

Elizabeth James: At the corner of culture and story

Every time Elizabeth James 
takes a breath to speak, you can 
see a story forming in her head. 
It builds until it’s right behind 
her teeth, and then she opens 
her mouth to create a world in 
the space around you with her 
words. For me, this is her office 
building, up in the University’s 
Haven Hall, tucked away in 
the kindest room I’ve ever seen 
— an entire wall covered with 
warm, loving photographs and 
artifacts that reflect her passion 
for culture and history lining 
every surface. The room has an 
inviting, colorful vibe — and 
there’s no better way to describe 
James. Her voice is soothing and 
relaxed, taking you with her into 
each story and piece of advice 
she has to offer. In her years 
as a storyteller, a friend and a 
mentor, she has touched and 
affected many peers, students, 
fellow staff members and more 
with her narratives.
A 
woman 
of 
many 
incredible experiences, James 
currently holds the position 
of outreach coordinator with 
the 
University’s 
Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies. In 2014, James became 
a Harold R. Johnson’s Diversity 
Service Award recipient, as 
well as the Office of Student 
Affairs’s Advisor of the Year. She 
has additionally been awarded 
the Cornerstone Award from 
the Black Celebratory among 
countless other honors for her 
dedication to DAAS and the 
student community. In addition 
to scheduling and coordinating 
events 
and 
publicizing 
on 
campus, James holds a rather 
crucial and important position 
in the hearts of alumni, staff 
and students alike — many 
would call her the University’s 
own resident storyteller. When 
asked to simply describe what 
this position and her work at 
the 
University 
surrounding 
storytelling entails, she took a 
moment to form her words — 
something she does often before 
she speaks — which lends to her 
acumen and astute voice.
“Storytelling is … ” She pauses, 
thinking 
of 
something, 
her 
grandmother perhaps, or a story 
previously told. “It is the healing 
yet gentle way to open the door 
to talk about experiences.”
In 
what 
could 
best 
be 
described as growing from her 
roots, James began her journey 
of telling stories when she was a 
young girl and her grandmother 
would tell stories around the 
dinner table and in her living 
room. This sparked her love for 
the art of storytelling and put her 
on the road to becoming a well-
known storyteller herself. As 
an observant young girl, James 
was infatuated with the idea 
of stories, and especially loved 
the ways in which they could 
transcend 
different 
cultures, 
teach lessons and bridge gaps 
between those with different 
backgrounds.
“My grandmother was an 
informal storyteller, she told 
stories as life lessons to heal 
people. You know, people didn’t 
talk about issues back then like 
they do now. So this was a way 
they could handle their grief,” 
she said.
From 
then 
on, 
she 
was 
hooked. As she grew up, her 
mother also took on storytelling, 
going on to have her stories 
recorded and broadcasted on 
WDET-FM radio station. James 
went on to study History of 
Art and Communications, then 
received a master’s degree in 
Journalism and Library Science. 
Despite varied interests, she 
always knew her path would 
trail back to storytelling at the 
end of the day. The stories and 
moments of her childhood were 
passed down from the hands 
of James’s grandmother to her 
mother, and have now landed 
in her palms. She has taken this 
foundation, shaped and molded 
and built it into something much 
greater than she ever imagined.
“To me, after I realized 
what storytelling meant to me 
and could mean to others, I 
began to explore myself and my 
background 
through 
stories. 
Now I use them to convey deeper 
emotions 
and 
metaphors,” 
she said. “I often think of 
writing a book with all of my 

grandmother’s stories in it. I just 
feel that in the future, I’d like to 
put those stories to paper.”
What 
James 
means 
by 
exploring 
her 
background 
through stories is exploring 
the 
intersection 
between 
culture and storytelling and 
what that means to her, the 
Mich. community and society 
as a whole. Her work consists 
of the importance of cultural 
storytelling and figuring out 
what this means to audiences, 
society and herself.
“The heartbeat of culture is 
storytelling. It captures all of our 

souls. We’re all storytellers,” she 
said. This is the mantra behind 
the 
community 
of 
cultural 
storytellers she has created here 
at the University.
What 
began 
with 
an 
informal conversation with the 
director of the National Center 
for 
Institutional 
Diversity 
has become one of the most 
important and fulfilling projects 
on 
which 
James 
has 
ever 
worked. For the bicentennial 
event at the University, James 
really wanted to explore and tell 
stories that aren’t being told on 
this campus. Whether it comes 
from students, alumni or staff, 
James had a sudden itch to lift 
up the voices of people who feel 
marginalized on this campus 
and celebrate them for their 
individuality.
“I saw a need to make the 
narrative of U of M richer and 
fuller because there are so many 
other stories than the ones that 
we hear on this campus every 
day,” she said.
And with that spark of an 
idea, she got to work. She began 
to reminisce about the past 
while looking at the present 
and the future, and she started 
to think about how the climate 
at the University could be 
supplemented and advanced by 
cultural storytelling. Out of this 
brainstorming came “MVisible 
Voices” — a podcast series 
dedicated to telling the types of 
stories this campus has stifled 
and left untold. The podcast 
series 
is 
intergenerational, 
sharing stories from alumni, 
students and faculty. James 
explains it as having a triangular 
style, split up between the three 
groups. However, after exploring 
different people’s stories, they 
began to realize that many 
had more connections than 
they originally imagined. They 
were able to make connections 
between the current members 
and creators, who have since 
graduated, of specific student 
groups on campus — students 
from years past who have 
had identical experiences to 
present students and watched as 
faculty related to and connected 
with 
students. 
The 
series 
allows listeners to discover 
the lost narratives of so many 
on this campus, and it seeks 
to demonstrate the struggle 
for change in society and the 
world. On the series’s website, 
in addition to listening to the 
podcast, you can learn about the 
history that puts the stories in a 
larger, national context.
“What’s 
so 
interesting 
is 
the intersectionality between 
cultures,” James said. “There 
are so many similarities between 
different cultures that we can 
explore through storytelling. 
Just starting from the base of 
it — every culture has some 
sort of creation myth or story … 
it defines human beings, being 
curious about why we’re here, 
and it builds from there.”
She moves from this to talk 
about how all basic questions 
have their roots in stories, 
which is why storytelling is such 
a universal art form: Stories are 
inherently relatable. This is why 

“MVisible Voices” is so relatable 
and intriguing — each person 
who listens can pull out different 
elements of the story with which 
they relate. This ties people 
closer together, regardless of 
their background, and proves 
that, at the very simplest point, 
we are all human beings who can 
share some inherent experience 
one way or another.
“Each 
culture 
has 
their 
mystery stories, their fiction 
stories, their sun stories, their 
water stories. Stories are just 
human beings trying to convey 
to ourselves and to others that 
we will go on. That we will make 
it. All stories deal with things 
that are greater than ourselves,” 
James said.
Right now on the website, 
you can explore a piece on 
the 
culturally-rooted 
Greek 
life organizations on campus, 
which 
discusses 
the 
stifled 
Latin, African American and 
Asian 
American 
Greek 
life 
organizations that are talked 
about so little. With just one 
click, you can learn about 
and listen to how students 
of 
historically 
marginalized 
identities live, learn and grow 
together. With another, you can 
explore campus movements at 
the University. This podcast is 
not just for those marginalized 
voices to feel heard, but to 
educate those with the privilege 
to have their stories and voices 
lifted up and heard every day on 
this campus.
In one podcast, titled “Days 
of Future Past,” former Black 
Student Union President Sherise 
Steele, 
Business 
sophomore 
Kyle Trocard and James have 
a 
conversation 
about 
the 
connection between technology 
and 
social 
change 
at 
the 
University. Steele speaks on the 
way in which the Black Student 
Union and other organizations 
used to have to get the word out 
about their meetings and events 
without technology.
“We communicated with mass 
meetings — but if we had to get 
the word out, we had to do hand-
to-hand combat. So someone 
went to every residence hall and 
posted fliers, did party invites, 
meeting invites and then word 
of mouth. So there was no other 
way other than to go to Markley; 
so whoever lived on the Hill 
had to take care of all the Hill 
residence halls. If you worked 
someplace where students ate 
— maybe you worked at the 
League or the Union and put 
the fliers there. That’s how 
we’d have to get the word out 
about protesting,” said Steele, 
who was also a first-generation 
graduate from the University. 

In this podcast, she is put into 
conversation with Trocard, who 
is currently involved with the 
Black Student Union.
“I feel like we know our 
place when it comes to handling 
things, 
and 
people 
have 
accused us of playing politics. 
But sometimes you have to 
do things in the way that the 
University will be willing to 
listen to you and so you know 
... speaking the language that 
they understand so that when 
you need something done, you 
can get it done. We find it hard 
to protest constantly — we can 
make a phone call, we can talk 
to the administration. When the 
time comes to protest though, 
we’re there,” Trocard said about 
the way the Black Student Union 
operates today.
The University is a hotbed 
for 
narrative 
negotiations 
and struggles as people come 
together 
from 
all 
different 
experiences and backgrounds 
to share in this creative learning 
environment. Not everyone gets 
to experience this University as 
a welcoming environment with

My grandmother’s biryani, 
a rice dish usually served with 
rich meats and yogurt sauce, 
is famous among my family 
and friends. If anyone ever 
pays a visit to Kolkata, a city in 
the East Indian state of West 
Bengal, they make sure to stop 
by her apartment. And any visit 
to my grandmother’s apartment 
warrants a feast. Once, when 
there was a gathering at her 
apartment, I saw her wake up 
at the crack of dawn to start 
cooking. By lunchtime, colossal 
dishes of biryani were taken 
out from the kitchen, along 
with equally large quantities 
of chicken and goat meat. I 
watched 30 relatives squeeze 
into the small space, happy to 
see each other but just as happy 
to eat the food in front of them.
I’ve always been surrounded 
by traditional Indian cooking 
— specifically Bengali cooking. 
I’m used to accidentally eating 
a whole chilli pepper at least 
once a week, and I know the 
best remedies for this situation 
(cold yogurt and sweet fruits, 
but never water). I very rarely 
eat dishes without two or three 
different types of spices. Often, 
one dish is so spicy that the 
lingering taste makes the rest 
spicy, too. My grandparents 
always ask me if I can “take 
the spice” in their cooking, as 
if it’s a competition. Spice is 
embraced in Indian cooking, 
and I’m accustomed to my eyes 
watering from the food I eat.
However, I’ve also grown up 
in America my whole life. I’ve 
eaten my fair share of B-Dubs 
and Jimmy Johns, especially 
since coming to college. But 
when I’m eating these foods, 
there seems to be something 
missing from the mix. I love 
my boneless wings as much as 
anyone, but somehow it doesn’t 
feel the same, even if I’m eating 
with my family. After being a 
college freshman for a semester, 

I believe I understand why.
Indian cooking is integrally 
different 
from 
American 
cooking. 
The 
approach 
to 
cooking, the way it’s done, 
how it’s eaten and so much 
more 
factor 
into 
Indian 
dishes. But I think the biggest 
component to Indian cooking 
is the people surrounding it. 
The social aspect of buying 
the 
ingredients, 
cooking 
and spending time together 
make Indian food more of 
an experience than an end 
product.
To explain what I mean, I’ll 
revisit my grandmother. Early 
in the morning, my grandfather 
stops by the outdoor market on 
his daily walk through Kolkata. 
When I walked through one 
of these markets, I was struck 
at the sheer amount of noise 
there was. Merchants yell out 
prices, live animals squawk and 
rickshaws blare their horns in 
the streets. I remember seeing 
multiple chickens running on 
the loose through the market 
plaza. My grandfather always 
barters for the prices until 
he’s satisfied. He brings home 
fresh vegetables and meat from 
animals butchered that day. 
Every single day.
Once the food is prepared, 
which usually takes two or 
three hours, we always eat 
together. We use a central 
carb, like rice or roti (a type 
of flatbread), to eat all the 
other dishes. The other dishes 
are usually gravy based, with 
a mixture of many cooked 
vegetables, or meat curry. No 
meal is complete without dal 
(similar to lentil soup). Dal 
never gets old — there are so 
many types that I’ve barely 
learned what they’re all called. 
We eat together for lunch and 
dinner. The times that we eat 
are naturally correlated with 
when we talk, tell stories and 
laugh. The dinner table has 
always been a lively place for 
me — even after eating we linger 
at the table for hours. If guests 
come over, the whole evening is 

spent around the table eating 
endless food and chatting.
We tend to have one extra 
meal for “tea time.” At five 
in the afternoon, everyone 
sits together to have tea and 
samosas (a triangular folded 
pastry with vegetable filling). 
If we want to call guests over 
in the afternoon, we ask them 
to come have tea with us. If this 
happens, “tea time” can last for 
hours. If we call guests over 
during meal times, three or 
four new dishes are prepared. 
It’s not uncommon for guests to 
come over and even participate 
in the cooking that the host 
started. It’s the cooking process 
and the interaction that comes 
with it that makes it special — 
not so much the end product.
Thus, 
everyone’s 
life 
practically revolves around the 
food they eat. If anyone stops by 
for a visit, they have to be given 
food first. It can be as small as 
some sweets or a whole dinner, 
but most times the first question 
asked is, “Will you eat?” The 
answer is always yes. If I’m at 
home, I know what each meal 
of the day will consist of before 
I even eat breakfast. The house 
perpetually smells like spices, 
but most times I don’t realize 
it until I leave the house and 
am greeted by the smell when 
I come back inside. When I 
open my bedroom door, I know 
what’s being cooked because 
the whole house is filled with 
the aroma.
Indian food cooked at home 
brings a togetherness that I 
just can’t seem to replicate 
anywhere else. Stepping inside 
my grandmother’s home in 
Kolkata, or even my home in 
MI, means that I’m immersed 
in the art of Indian cooking 
and the social bonds that come 
with it. My grandmother offers 
me a thousand different foods 
when I walk through the door. 
Feeding me is her priority 
because she takes immense 
delight in sharing her food with 
others. And I wouldn’t want to 
have it any other way.

Nestled 
on 
Main 
Street, 
between 
Shinola 
and 
Da 
Vinci’s Salon & Gallery lies 
Ten Thousand Villages. Carol 
Grafton, 
event 
coordinator 
and visual merchandiser for 
the shop, tells me she loves 
the location: in the heart of 
downtown, next to plenty of 
restaurants, bars and venues that 

can get crowded during peak 
hours. Grafton smiles when she 
calls Ten Thousand Villages a 
good date store, one that catches 
the eyes of stumblers waiting for 
open doors or a table.
It’s easy to see why she 
thinks so — the interior of Ten 

Thousand Villages is covered, 
ceiling to floor, with works of 
art for sale from around the 
world. Some of them are more 
marketable 
than 
others, 
of 
course, but it’s just enough to 
get the cogs of the mind turning. 
Maybe we could put this in the 
kitchen? This would look great in 
your bathroom. Move in with me. 
Er, sorry, I’m getting distracted.
When I walk into the store, 
however, it’s a rainy Tuesday 
morning and I’m alone. A sweet 

salesperson 
named 
Bonnie 
greets me, telling me about Ten 
Thousand Villages’s mission and 
variety of artwork. We begin at 
the middle of the store, perusing 
some jewelry made of thick shell-
like discs and strung together 
by a rustic cotton cord. Bonnie 

tells me that the discs are made 
from the tagua nut, which comes 
from a South American palm 
tree species. I turn the smooth, 
sturdy sections of the necklace in 
my hand — it feels high quality.
As Grafton takes the lead 
from Bonnie and guides me 
throughout the rest of the store, 
she gives me the lowdown on 
Ten Thousand Villages.
“We’re the oldest fair-trade 
store [in the world], started by 
one little woman: Edna Ruth 

Byler,” she said. When Byler 
visited Puerto Rico in 1946 with 
her family, she was amazed at 
the diligence and work ethic 
of the women there. Struck by 
the quality and uniqueness of 
their textiles, Byler bought their 
needlework and brought it to the 

United States to sell. Grafton 
also mentioned, “We started the 
fair-trade federation.”
Since 1946, Ten Thousand 
Villages 
has 
expanded 
immensely. There are currently 
52 locations across the United 
States that carry more than 
just Puerto Rican textiles. On 
my way through the store, 
I see necklaces made from 
repurposed bomb casings in 
Cambodia, coasters made from 
newspapers in Vietnam and 
wall décor made from oil drums 
in Haiti. The necklaces are 
stylish and fashion-conscious, 
like something you might see 
at Urban Outfitters, while the 
coasters and wall décor are more 
clearly designed with an eco-
friendly aesthetic and mind.
“Ten 
Thousand 
Villages 
encourages 
recycling 
and 
sustainable products,” Grafton 
mentioned.
“We try to stay with the 
trends,” she added. Grafton 
shared 
that 
Ten 
Thousand 
Villages 
works 
on 
a 
more 
personal level with their artisans 
from around the world.
“We 
work 
and 
cobble 
together,” she continued. “It’s a 
partnership. We have to make 
sure it’s going to sell. It has to 
be 
readily 
available, 
unique 
products that you wouldn’t find 
in other stores. Something a part 
of their tradition and part of 
their culture.”
As 
Bonnie 
leads 
me 
throughout the rest of the store, I 
see a good deal of other products 
that resemble what you could see 
at a Hallmark or a Home Goods. 
Some of the seasonal goods 
are very clearly commissioned 
with a clear aesthetic in mind, 
and marked down because it’s 
past the holidays. I point some 
of these out, wondering how 
much the artisans are paid 
after the markdown. Grafton is 
nonplussed, and said, “When we 
mark it down, people will come 

in and ask, well, how much did 
the artisans actually get paid? 
We pay them half at the start of 
the job, and half once it makes it 
through customs, so the artisans 
are paid in full before it even 
sells here.”
I look around some more, 
noticing that not all of the 
products seem so idiosycratic. 
At the back, on a wide table that 
takes a good deal of floorspace, 
are 
beautiful 
blown-glass 
goblets, decanters, pitchers and 
carafes from the West Bank. 
Each of them has the faint opacity 
and texture of sea glass, but with 
wavy and intricate patterns. The 
most arresting works of art in the 
store are those that are tied most 
closely to a region’s heritage, like 
the baskets from Bangladesh 
and Uganda or the singing bowls 
from Nepal.
Ten 
Thousand 
Villages 
usually 
finds 
their 
artisans 
through co-op houses around 
the world.
“A lot of our artisans are out in 
the country,” Grafton said. “We 
provide health care and make 
sure the tenets of fair trade are 
being met. We’re very vendor 
focused. We ask them what they 
need to make a living and stick 
with our artisans for 20 years.”
Unlike 
some 
other 
retail 
chains, Ten Thousand Villages 
is devoted to strengthening 
the communities from which 
they are sourced. From the 
beginning, 
Ten 
Thousand 
Villages focused on supporting 
the work of women — a goal 
that they continue to strive to 
meet. Women from around the 
world are given the work skills 
they need to be independent and 
productive members of their 
society.
Ten Thousand Villages also 
relies on its rich history of fair 
trade and international art work 
with which the average customer 
may not be so familiar.
“Ann Arbor is a very educated 

community, but I don’t think 
that was the case a couple years 
ago,” Grafton said.
She goes on to explain that 
much of their training deals 
with 
teaching 
workers 
and 
volunteers about the tenets of 
fair trade. I think back to when 
I stepped into the store, and 
Bonnie immediately opened up 
to me about the principles of Ten 
Thousand Villages.
Since Ten Thousand Villages 
follows a non-traditional retail 
model, many of their workers are 
volunteers.
“I had been asked to be on the 
start-up team,” Grafton said. “I 
started as a volunteer for about 
a year, and then I started doing 
some visual merchandising part-
time.”
She has worked with the 
downtown 
location 
since 
it 
opened 13 and a half years ago. 
Both her lengthy tenure and the 
quantity of volunteers leads me 
to think that those who work at 
Ten Thousand Villages really 
believe in their message.
While Ten Thousand Villages 
has found a home on Main 
Street, they still struggle to 
connect with the University and 
student organizations. Grafton 
makes a point of saying that “it 
takes eight hours a month to be 
a volunteer, and we’re always 
looking for more, especially 
students.”
Because of this, Ten Thousand 
Villages has had to reach out to 
the University, and on Feb. 6, they 
will be hosting a book discussion 
on Yaa Gyasi’s “Homegoing” 
with 
Brenda 
McGadney-
Douglass, a social work professor 
from the University of Toledo. 
For those that can make it, 
the store promises a bounty of 
fair-trade coffee and chocolate 
sampling. But for others, Ten 
Thousand Villages will remain 
cozy on Main Street, waiting for 
a fortunate wanderer to come in 
and seek shelter from the rain.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘HOW SIMPLE’

 On “How Simple,” Philly-
based indie rock band 
Hop Along combines more 
instruments on a single 
track than they ever have 
before. The single arrives 
ahead of the group’s third 
album, Bark Your Head Off, 
Dog. Scheduled to release 
in just over two months on 
Apr. 6, the album is their 
first since 2015’s Painted 
Shut (though their 2012 
debut, Get Disowned, was 
reissued in 2016). The 
track signals not a shift in 
the quartet’s style, but an 
elaboration upon the impec-
cable style they already pos-
sess. “How Simple” opens 
with acoustic strumming, 
Frances Quinlan’s singular 
voice jumping in immedi-

ately, almost as if she’d been 
waiting this entire time.
 Soon after, electric gui-

tar, percussion and then 
synthesizer enter the mix. 
While Mark Quinlan’s 
drumming propels the piece 
forward for the majority of 
its duration, other instru-
ments dip in for short bouts, 
rarely remaining for more 
than 25 seconds. The song 
is just under four minutes, 
but feels epic as it moves 
through countless overlap-
ping but distinct motifs — 
there’s even what sounds 

like a hand-clap sample at 
one point. “How Simple” is 
a journey through various 
stages of unrest, anxiety 
and fear, though Quinlan’s 
voice never quite cracks as 
we’ve heard it do before. 
Nonetheless, her perfor-
mance is emotive as ever. 
“How simple my heart can 
be / Frightens me,” she 
sings during a section that 
most closely resembles a 
chorus. As the song draws 
to a close, we’re treated to 
a calming violin melody, 
which pairs quite nicely 
with Quinlan’s voice as the 
two reach a disarmingly 
content conclusion.

So you say you want to 
be a couturier, do you?

The first time I came across 
“A Perfect Day for Bananafish” 
it was in the form of 10 
printed pages delivered by 
my sister as she stumbled off 
a train from Mich. Her friend 
had written a dissertation on 
it in high school, and on her 
recommendation 
my 
sister 
printed it off for the trip from 
Mich. to Chicago. “You should 
read it if you liked ‘Catcher in 
the Rye’,” Mimi told me as she 
placed the pages before me on 
the kitchen counter.
Liked “Catcher”? I didn’t 
just like “Catcher,” I thought 
incredulously. 
Along 
with 
every 
other 
unbearably 
angsty 
15-year-old, 
I 
worshipped it and treasured 
the voice of Holden Caulfield, 
his weariness towards life 
and bemoaning over phonies 
everywhere. 
“It 
perfectly 
captures the listlessness of 
youth,” I would tell anyone 
who asked, but mostly those 
who didn’t.
Were I being honest with 
myself, I would have been able 
to admit the book didn’t do 
much for me. My dedication 
to the book at 15 was entirely 
guided by a pursuit of social 
capital. I was a teenage girl 
with a bunch of friends who 

were obsessed with the book 
and the faux-academic air it 
allowed us to presume. It’s 
not that I hated the book 
or anything; I just couldn’t 
figure out what the big deal 
with Salinger was all about.
But then I met Seymour 
Glass, and in 10 pages, I 
fell in love. It’s Salinger’s 
sickly 
sweet 
cruelty 
that 
drew me in. Forget Holden 
and his droning thoughts, 
here I had Muriel and Sybil 
and Seymour. Here I had a 
woman who “for a ringing 
phone 
dropped 
exactly 
nothing” and bananafish that 
contract banana fever from 
uncontrollable eating. Here 
I had Seymour, holding onto 
the edge of a little girl’s foot 
as waves of the ocean carried 
her, before later putting a 
pistol to his head.
Maybe it was the precision 
with which Salinger describes 
Muriel applying lacquer to 
her nails or the slicing sound 
of young Sybil yelling after 

“see more glass.” Maybe it 
was that I never anticipated 
the ending.
“Nine Stories” has carried 
me through the last five 
years of my life. I find 
myself revisiting the hazy, 
cigarette smoke-filled living 
room of “Uncle Wiggley in 
Connecticut” with its two 
women lying on their backs, 
scotch glasses on their chests, 
reliving their college days 
and lost loves. I find myself 
thinking of the missing wife 
in “Pretty Mouth and Green 
My Eyes” and her desperate 
husband who doesn’t suspect 
that she might be found in the 
hotel room of a friend. I think 
about how I want to talk, 
write, be like the characters 
he crafts. On another day in 
another life, I’d be a Salinger 
character, 
built 
from 
the 
ground up by his pen. I want 
to exist in the mind of a 
writer 
whose 
descriptions 
and dialogue are laden with 
humor and sadness.
These stories are undercut 
by small and heavy tragedies, 
filled with characters simply 
trying to figure out how to 
live in a world overwrought 
with 
unexplainable 
peculiarities 
and 
sorrows. 
Philip Roth, in his 1961 essay 
“Writing American Fiction,” 
writes that the only solution 
Salinger gives us for how to 
live in this world, between 
The Glass Family and Holden, 
is “to be charming on the 
way to the loony bin.” But 
I disagree. In the wake of 
Salinger’s specialty sadness, 
something persists. At the end 
of each story, when the words 
on the page shake you to your 
core and leave you hollow, 
something else drags you on. 
It’s why placing “Bananafish” 
as the first of nine stories 
doesn’t immediately halt the 
collection. We are human, and 
because of this our fascination 
for the uncanny and devotion 
to reading another’s sadness 
all stems from an effort to 
figure out our own.
The spring of my freshman 
year of college a friend from 
back home came to visit. He 
had recently lost a brother 
and I, a friend. In an effort to 
escape the shadow of this loss 
I threw myself into making the 
weekend fun for him, filled 
with exuberant distractions 
like karaoke and blistering 
hangovers. And while it was 
fun, something about him, 
our relationship, had shifted 
in the months since death 
visited 
our 
doorstep. 
His 
signature 
pessimism 
had 
become darker, more sinister. 
I was drained by the end of his 
visit, the inevitability of our 
changing relationship leaving 
me limp and exhausted.
My sister came to meet 
me in the Diag the day after 
I dropped him off at the 
bus station. My body was 
hungover and heavy with 
weariness, so we simply laid 

back into the warm sun of 
a late Apr. day and talked, 
sharing a sandwich. Months 
earlier, on the night the news 
of Danny’s death had reached 
me, I was lying next to her in 
her bed overcome with grief. 
Now I lay next to her in the 
sun overcome with something 
close to grief, but not quite.
She read “For Esme — with 
Love and Squalor” aloud for 
me that day. From start to 
finish her voice told the story 
that had been my favorite 
since I read the collection all 
those years ago. I fell in love 
once again with the soldier 
and his lovely affection for 

Esme, the little girl with an 
arrogant wit in whom I saw 
a little too much of myself. I 
fell in love once again with 
its 
strange 
structure, 
its 
self-reflexivity 
that 
seems 
to stretch farther into J.D. 
Salinger’s own life than any 
other of the nine. I fell in 
love once again with all its 
nuances and all of its fac—f-a-
c-u-l-t-i-e-s.
I often return to those 
hours 
Mimi 
and 
I 
spent 
lying in the Diag, just as I 
return to these stories. In 
reading them, I’m able to read 
myself in different places, 
at different times in my life. 
And every late Jan., when 
the cold creeps around the 
corner and the excitement of 
the new year slowly turns to 
dust, I yearn for the warmth 
of the sun, not the cold of 
dim memories. I yearn for the 
sunburn that slowly stretched 
across my face as Mimi and I 
read stories filled with love 
and squalor and humor and 
grief. I clutch to Salinger, 
his words and his characters 
who don’t presume to know 
anything about living in the 
world, but who simply subsist 
and push on from one story to 
the next.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 
 At the beginning of the 
new music video for X 
Ambassadors’s “JOYFUL,” 
band members move around 
the inside of an extravagant 
concert hall. They climb 
the stage, tap on drums and 
get ready. Then, all outside 
noise fades, and the song 
begins … and they just kind 
of stay there.
 The entire video takes 
place on the stage of the 
concert hall, panning 
between lead singer Sam 
Harris at the microphone, 
fellow band members Casey 
Harris and Adam Levin on 
keyboard and drums and a 
backup choir that emerges 
around halfway through. 
Things pick up a little with 
the introduction of the 
choir, less due to the music 
video than to the building 
tension and excitement in 
the music itself.
 It’s not that “JOYFUL” is 
a bad music video; it’s just 
that it doesn’t really seem to 
add anything to the song. X 
Ambassadors deliver a crisp 
performance, not unenjoy-

able to watch, but also not 
particularly noteworthy. 
At its best, a music video 
shouldn’t just be a well-
captured performance of a 
quality song; it should be 
a way to take what you’re 
already saying with the 
song and accentuate it using 
film, to be more creative 
with it, to give it dimension. 
It doesn’t really feel like X 
Ambassadors accomplished 
that with “JOYFUL.”
 That being said, the video 
does at least fit nicely along-
side the song. The song has 
a very simple message, and 
the video delivers it plainly 
— when Harris sings that 
he wants to be “joyful and 
happy, just being alive,” it 
seems like the video is try-
ing to deliver itself with 
the same unembellished 

approach as the song. The 
straightforward nature of 
the video underscores this, 
as it seems to beckon the 
viewer to immerse them-
selves in the performance; 
at the very end, the camera 
even lifts high above the 
city, eventually leaving the 
word “JOYFUL” all by itself 
in a bright blue sky.
 There aren’t any glaring 
problems with the video 
for “JOYFUL,” and in many 
ways it does embody a lot 
of what the song is already 
saying. It doesn’t reach 
very far beyond embodying, 
though, and this restraint is 
what unfortunately holds it 
back from being a standout 
music video.

BOOKS

I’d like to begin with an 
unfortunate disclaimer: Juicy 
Couture is not real couture. 
The phrase Haute Couture 
is French for “high sewing.” 
Its 
implications 
developed 
out of a 1945 decision made by 
France’s Chambre Syndicale 
de la Haute Couture, which 
determined 
that 
“Haute 
Couture” should become a 
legal designation for fashion 
houses who qualify to become 
members 
of 
the 
Chambre 
Syndicale. Today, just over 150 
designers in the world boast 
the auspicious designation.
Why, you might ask, did 
any of this hierarchical legal 

action begin in the first place? 
And in response, dear reader, 
I will remind you that “high” 

fashion’s origins lie within a 
hotbed of European elitism. 
The Chambre Syndicale de la 
Haute Couture was started 
upon such a foundation in 
1868, when a group of Parisian 
dressmakers, couturiers, came 
together in hopes of regulating 
one another with regards to 
counterfeiting, 
collection 
release 
dates, 
number 
of 
models 
per 
fashion 
show, 
proper relations with the press 
and issues of fashion-related 
laws and taxes.
Today, 
the 
Chambre 
Syndicale exists within the 
jurisdiction of the Fédération 
de la Haute Couture et de 
la Mode, whose mission is 
to “promote French fashion 
culture, 
where 
Haute 
Couture and creation have a 
major impact by combining 
traditional know how and 
contemporary technology at 
all times,” according to their 
website. The Fédération is 
responsible for maintaining 
virtually 
every 
aspect 
of 
Parisian 
high 
fashion, 
but 
perhaps 
most 
integral 
to 
the city’s reputation as the 
world’s fashion capital is the 
Chambre Syndicale’s highly-
curated 
list 
of 
members, 
who have the opportunity to 
show collections as part of 
the prestigious semi-annual 
Couture Fashion Week.
There 
are 
many 
key 
differences between ordinary 
Fashion 
Week 
collections, 
often referred to as ready-
to-wear, 
and 
couture. 
I’ll 
scratch the surface: Ready-
to-wear garments are factory-

made in standard sizes, and 
are available to most anyone 
willing to shell out the cash 
for a 900-dollar t-shirt. The 
same can’t be said for couture 
collections, which boast one-
of-a-kind, handmade pieces 
made to measure for fashion’s 
uppermost echelon of clientele 
(i.e. 
royalty 
and 
Julianne 

Moore). 
Other 
notable 
criteria for Haute Couture 
status include ownership of a 
workshop, or atelier, in Paris 
that employs at least 15 full-
time staff members and 20 
full-time technical employees, 
and the presentation of at 
least 50 original designs to 
the public every season, in 
Jan. and Jul.. It is ultimately 
up to Fédération executives to 
determine who earns the title

of couturier, along with which 
designers should be chosen as 
“guest members” for a given 
season.
Outside 
of 
tangible 
requirements, couture designs 
tend to be more outrageous 
than their commercially-sold 
counterparts. Couture Week 
Spring-Summer 
2018 
just 
wrapped up, and featured a 
refreshing quantity of textures, 
colors and voluminous feather 
headpieces. Standout pieces 
were seen at Dior, where 
newly-minted 
creative 
director Maria Grazia Chiuri 
at last seemed to find her 
footing, within Giambattista 
Valli’s 
tulle-laden 
paradise 
and at Giorgio Armani Privé, 
where 
watercolor 
reigned 
supreme. 
Guest 
members 
like Guo Pei and Iris Van 
Herpen 
breathed 
new 
life 
into the institution’s deeply 

homogenous framework.

Greater diversity in member 
brands’ leadership is making 

Haute Couture more exciting 
than 
ever. 
This 
season 
saw the rise of the female 
creative director — namely, 
Grazia Chiuri at Dior and 
Guo and Van Herpen at their 
eponymous labels — along 
with non-European brands, 
like American expat Proenza 
Schouler and Lebanese fan 
favorite Elie Saab. Fashion 
has a long, long way to go, but 
to see its most discriminatory 
subgroup making progress is 
exciting, no doubt.
Let’s circle back to that 
Juicy tracksuit you wore every 
week in middle school. It was 
special, yes, a fundamental 
ingredient to the anxiety-
filled casserole that was your 
formative years. But make 
no mistake: There’s no way a 
legacy upholstered in velour 
could make the Haute Couture 
cut.

I’d like to 

begin with an 

unfortunate 

disclaimer: 

Juicy Couture

subsequent series that ensued, 
real-world competitive a cappella 
requires hours of meticulous 
rehearsal and thought — not just 
a miraculous cut from one scene 
to the next. The competition 
featured in “Pitch Perfect” — The 
International Championship of 
Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) — 
was first founded in 1996, and 
currently has around 450 groups 
competing in nine regions all 
over the country. The ICCA 
operates in a bracket-style setup, 
with competitors progressing 
through 
quarterfinals, 
semifinals and finals.
What 
can 
you 
do 
in 
a 
12-minute performance? In a 
trend that’s gradually growing 
in the a cappella sphere, South 
Asian inspired campus group 
Maize 
Mirchi 
goes 
further 
than mere coordinated dance 
moves; they tell stories. Mirchi’s 
South Asian twist takes shape in 
their performances through a 
repertoire of several languages 
— including, but not limited to, 
Hindi. Their overarching goal is 
to fuse South Asian culture with 
pop music, creating a new style 
of sounds that people may not 
have heard before. Onstage, the 
15-person group harnesses the 
delicately blended magic of their 
voices along with expressive 
face and body motions for truly 
chilling, magnetic performances.
“When you’ve got 16 people 
on a stage doing them all at the 
same time and trying to show 
the audience a specific emotion 
or a specific part of a story that’s 
occurring, then it has a pretty big 
impact,” said LSA Sophomore 
Swathi Sampath, one of Mirchi’s 
performance directors, in an 
interview with The Daily.
The 
group’s 
most 
recent 
performance storyline from last 
year’s competition cycle — which, 
for Mirchi, meant competing not 
only at the ICCAs but also at 
Awaazein (a competition similar 
to the ICCAs, except half of the 
12 minute performance must be 
South Asian, and performers 
must portray a story) — conveyed 
two separate stories of two 
characters, one who was facing 
inner demons and one dealing 
with outer conflict from an 
abusive relationship. However, 
the narratives in each set change 
depending 
on 
what 
songs 
Mirchi decides on and what the 
members feel come out of the 
music.
Sampath is responsible for 
everything, 
from 
figuring 
out what to wear to events to 
choreographing the 12-minute 
set — including the movements, 
facial expressions and emotions 
the 
group 
conveys 
during 
performances. Her experience 
with music goes back 13 years, 
when she was five years old and 
first started singing the Indian 
classical genre.
“I came here and knew I 
wanted to try a cappella as a 

different type of music that I 
hadn’t done before,” Sampath 
said. “I’m really into Indian 
music, since that’s a lot of my 
background, but also Western 
music as well, and when I found 
a group that did both of them 
together I realized that was the 
only one I really wanted to do.”
Mirchi’s members come from 
all different experience levels. 
Engineering Sophomore Prakash 
Kumar, one of the group’s music 
directors, had plenty of classical 
training in piano and trumpet, 
but only really started singing 
his senior year of high school.
“In high school, I started 
a band,” Kumar said. “We 
performed at our high school 
talent show, and we ended up 
winning by playing sort of a 
mashup of songs by Coldplay 
— that was the first time I’d 
actually sang in front of people 
in my life. I was terrified. But 
it went well! And so I was like, 
‘Hey, I can maybe sing!’”
Since the group first formed 
11 years ago, Maize Mirchi has 

released two full studio albums 
and two EPs. Silent Call, the 
group’s most recent release, was 
actually recorded in a member’s 
basement with the help of 
Liquid 5th — a North Carolina-
based 
production 
company 
that specializes in a range of 
services for a cappella singing, 
including 
producing 
albums, 
mastering tracks, running live 
performances or merely giving 
constructive 
criticism 
for 
a 
group.
“What we do is set up these 
mics and we have an air horn 
and we have to make everything 
super quiet. If there are any birds 
outside, we take the air horn 
and scare them away because 
otherwise, you’ll hear the birds 
in the recording,” Kumar said.
Recording is a seemingly 
straightforward 
process, 
but 
a cappella recording is far 
more complex than it lets on. 
Unlike 
choral 
recordings, 
a 
cappella recordings must be 
done individually, and usually 
more than once so that there’s 
a backup of every part. What’s 
more, mixing a cappella requires 
both precision and balance, 
due to the natural variations of 
voices and how different vocal 
parts go together. If not blended 

perfectly, the piece won’t sound 
right.
“You have a bass and you 
have 
someone 
doing 
vocal 
percussion, and those things will 
be equalized differently than the 
rest of the group, so you need 
to have those on their separate 
mics,” Kumar said. “And then 
sometimes you’ll have these 
weird moving parts in a song or 
an arrangement that you’ll want 
to bring out more — if you have 
just one mic sitting there, you 
can’t say ‘Bring out the altos!’ 
because they’re in the mix, 
they’re in the whole song.”
Liquid 5th’s clients are often 
award-winning 
groups, 
and 
Maize Mirchi is no exception. 
The group won last year’s ICCA 
quarterfinals and ended up 
competing 
at 
semifinals 
in 
Chicago.
This 
year, 
Mirchi 
isn’t 
competing 
at 
the 
ICCA 
because they’ll be hosting the 
competition on Feb. 10th at the 
Power Center. However, they 
are still training to compete in 
Awaazein and currently hold 
three two-hour long rehearsals 
per week.
“Closer to competition, we 
increase that, and sometimes 
we 
even 
have 
a 
rehearsal 
that lasts forever until we 
feel satisfied. It’s named the 
‘Infinity’ 
rehearsal, 
and 
it 
usually happens closer to the 
actual day where we need to 
be performing it,” Kumar said. 
“It’s hard because you have to 
remember not only your notes 
but also your choreography and 
to sing well while you’re doing 
it, which is a lot harder because 
you have to breathe.”
Maize Mirchi is one of 16 
a cappella groups affiliated 
with the Michigan A Cappella 
Council, 
which, 
according 
to their website, means that 
the University is home to the 
largest a cappella community 
in the entire country. But as the 
University’s only South Asian 
themed group, Maize Mirchi is 
faced with a unique challenge 
when it comes to fitting into the 
University’s greater culture.
“It’s always been a problem 
for us, actually, because as a 
group that is a South Asian 
inspired a cappella group that 
actually does a lot of other 
stuff, it’s kind of hard to find an 
audience that is into all of that, 
that we do,” Kumar said. “For 
us, we really fit in by going to a 
lot of cultural gigs, but we also 
get to perform on stages like 
the ICCAs, and as of late we’ve 
been doing well enough to be 
recognized by at least the other 
a cappella groups on campus.”
In the end, what Mirchi’s 
members love most is the 
harmony that grows out of time, 
effort and a shared appreciation 
for the art.
“It’s great to be surrounded 
by people who share the same 
passion for creating the type 
of music you want to create, 
and with Mirchi’s specialty — 
which I think is the emotional 
connection to what we do — it 
becomes a lot of fun,” Sampath 
said. “It’s just something you do 
because you love it and you love 
the people you’re doing it with.”

Artist Profile: A capella 
Maize Mirchi storytells

Here’s a piping hot take: British 
sitcoms are funnier and far more 
refined than American sitcoms. 
Just hear me out.
It’s not that I don’t like American 
sitcoms — some of my favorite 
TV shows include “Parks & 
Recreation,” “30 Rock,” “Scrubs,” 
“Broad 
City” 
and 
currently, 
“The Good Place.” But ever since 
freshman year of college, I have 
found myself gravitating more 
toward watching contemporary 
British sitcoms. There’s something 
about British humor that I find 
much 
more 
appealing, 
more 
refreshing 
and 
more 
soul-
crushingly real than the average 
American TV comedy. That may 
seem a bit hyperbolic, but British 
sitcoms — with their lovable yet 
wildly chaotic characters, brisk 
pacing, progressive themes and 
heartwarming humor — are still 
worthy of merit, especially in 
this age of binge-watching and 
streaming services.
Earlier this semester, I spent a 
good deal talking about “Lovesick,” 
the sharp, tantalizing rom-com 
from the mind of writer/producer 
Tom Edge (“The Crown”) that 
reads as a British hybrid of “How 
I Met Your Mother,” “Friends” and 
“You’re The Worst.” Rather than 
simply borrowing the themes and 
the energetic, youthful casts from 
each of those shows, “Lovesick” 
does something entirely different; 
it 
transcends 
classic 
sitcom 
tropes by taking major dramatic 
risks. Each episode pokes fun 
at the characters, but does so 
without 
sacrificing 
the 
more 
human complexities underlying 
their motivations and actions. 
“Lovesick” isn’t just a story about 
a single hopeless romantic; it’s a 
multifaceted tale of every young 
person’s fear of rejection and 
commitment. “Lovesick” trusts its 
audience enough to neatly balance 
comedy with drama, which is why 
it primarily succeeds better than 

American sitcoms and even other 
British sitcoms ever could. It’s 
also just a breezy watch — the first 
season contains six episodes and 
the second and third contain eight. 
 
British sitcoms also benefit from 
the versatility and autonomy of 
their creators. Three shows that 
come to mind are “Crashing,” 
“Fleabag” and “Chewing Gum.” 
The first two were created, written 
by and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge 
(“Goodbye Christopher Robin”), 
who won the 2017 BAFTA for 
Best Female Performance in a 
Comedy for “Fleabag.” The latter 
was created, written by and stars 
Michaela Coel (“Black Mirror”), 
who 
won 
the 
2016 
BAFTA 
Breakthrough Talent award for 
her work on “Chewing Gum.” Each 
of these shows, while varying in 
aesthetic and tone, share a singular 
style of devilishly ribald humor.
“Crashing,” in particular, has 
a kooky concept: It follows the 
lives of six working-class friends, 
led by Waller-Bridge herself as 
the infectious Lucy, living in an 
abandoned hospital that poses as 
a sort of makeshift co-op. In just 
six hysterical half-hour episodes, 
Waller-Bridge 
breaks 
down 
every possible sitcom trope — the 
awkwardness of dinner parties, 
the tensions between friendships 
and 
sexual 
relationships, 
the 
endless existential dread of being 
in your 20s — with keen, almost 
effortless efficiency.
Waller-Bridge 
continues 
to 
expand upon traditional sitcom 
setups in her much darker and 
bolder follow-up “Fleabag,” where 
she plays a nameless Londonite 
attempting to navigate her life 
after the death of her best friend. 
Though each episode shows her 
breaking the fourth wall — a 
typical framing device used in 
TV comedies like “The Office” — 
Waller-Bridge skillfully uses her 
character’s interactions with the 
audience as a defense mechanism 
for the secrets she hides from those 
around her. It definitely works in 
eliciting laughs, but it plays just as 
effectively when heightening the 

drama of a scene.
Much like “Fleabag,” “Chewing 
Gum” incorporates a fourth-wall-
breaking structure, but to a much 
more absurd degree. A friend of 
mine once described this show 
as a cross between “Jane the 
Virgin,” 
“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
and “Insecure,” which, to be fair, 
isn’t completely wrong. The show 
tells the story of Tracey (Coel), a 
horny, Beyoncé-obsessed 24-year-
old virgin residing with her uber-
religious mother in the low-income 
neighborhood of Tower Hamlets, 
London. As an exercise in cringe 
comedy, “Chewing Gum” (mostly) 
works: The characters are wacky 
but not totally insufferable, the 
dialogue is raunchy but not too 
gross and the visual gags, most 
of which revolve around sex, 
are, well, not very sexy, but still 
entertain.
What differentiates “Chewing 
Gum” from other sitcoms, however, 
is the strong personal voice behind 
Coel’s writing and characters. 
Her subtle social commentary 
about religion, sex, money and 
young adulthood feels earned in 
the way Coel transposes them in 
an obscene, albeit unabashedly 
personal, setting. It’s no wonder, 
then, that “Chewing Gum” is 
based on a semi-autobiographical 
play Coel wrote in 2012, which 
inevitably helped give an elasticity 
to the show’s comedic flair.
Sure, British sitcoms may not 
appeal to everyone in the States 
(or elsewhere, for that matter). 
The stuffiness of the dialogue 
and the characters may come 
off as too esoteric for some — 
even The Guardian writer Ben 
Elton thinks snobbery and “lazy 
contempt” are killing the British 
sitcom. British sitcoms also have 
a known history of perpetuating 
xenophobic and racist humor 
(though American sitcoms have 
been guilty of reinforcing harmful 
stereotypes as well). But it is worth 
noting the value British sitcoms 
add to the overall scope of modern 
international entertainment and 
comedic storytelling.

British sitcoms need love

Nestled behind a Lucky’s 
grocery store and a Walgreens in 
an unassuming strip mall in my 
hometown of Fremont, CA was 
a movie theater called Naz 8. 
However, this wasn’t your typical 
shining, flashy Century or AMC. 
Instead of the scent of buttered 
popcorn, you’d be greeted with 
(or rather, overwhelmed by) the 
aroma of samosas, curry, spices 
and similar items being sold 
as concessions. The place was 
poorly lit and grimy, the seats 
were centuries old; at every 
screening, you could guarantee 
people would be talking or a 
baby would be bawling.
Yet despite all its flaws, 
hundreds, sometimes thousands, 
of people — mostly Indian 
immigrants like my family — 
would flock to Naz 8 Cinemas 
for a taste of home. Everyone, 
from the recent arrivals hoping 
to make it big in Silicon Valley 
to 
the 
established, 
newly 
minted 
American 
citizens, 
would marvel at the spectacles 
of melodrama, song and dance 
known as Bollywood films. We 
would gasp at Salman Khan 
breaking the laws of physics 
and shed tears of laughter and 
sadness as Amir Khan satirized 
the education system. My mom 
would shield my eyes with her 
sweater in horror during a sex 

scene, angrily cursing the fact 
she believed the box office 
attendant when he said, “Of 
course you can watch it with 
your 10-year-old.”
While in retrospect those 
same movies seem ridiculously 
corny and overwrought, I would 
be lying if I said I wouldn’t see 
them again any time you ask me 
to. As shown in shows such as 
“Master of None” and several 
other works, it’s often difficult 
for children of immigrants (such 
as me) to relate to the society and 
environment that our parents 
grew up in. Although we grew up 
eating Indian food, and some of 
us speak Bengali, Hindi, Tamil 
or some other Indian language 
at home, the connection beyond 
that with our family’s country 
becomes tenuous.
It is beautiful to learn so 
much about my family by simply 
going to the movies. Even now, 
and especially for a 10-year-old, 
the simultaneously adrenaline-
fueled, romance-filled stories of 
good and evil were solid sources 
of 
entertainment. 
Yet 
one 
common element was that they 
were not set in Middle Earth 
or outer space, but actually in 
India. Our parents could point 
out the neighborhoods that were 
similar to where they grew up, 
the school uniforms they had to 
wear and the foods they used to 
eat off the street stalls. Parents 
who were engineers could point 
out elements of their college 

experience in “3 Idiots.” They 
could even take advantage of the 
historical flicks such as “Jodha 
Akbar” to teach us what they 
learned in their history classes.
Through these tiny moments, 
we could strengthen the bonds 
between 
ourselves 
and 
our 
parents. We could understand 
the world they came from as well 
as the small societal differences 
that end up causing friction 
in the present-day. For me, it 
gives a failsafe conversation 
starter when I travel to meet 
my relatives. Even if the person 
I just met is my third cousin 
once removed with a completely 
different set of life experiences, 
at least we have one thing in 
common.
By knowing and watching the 
same movies that my parents 
watched before I was born, 
and listening to the songs they 
listened to, I can feel that much 
closer to them. I also learned 
that my habit of waxing (overly) 
poetic about works that I love is 
an inherited one.
Naz closed recently, ever since 
many large American theaters 
started playing Bollywood films 
(except with better amenities 
and 
comfortable 
seats). 
Although I can’t say I miss Naz 
and its general seediness, I can’t 
deny that I always feel a tinge of 
nostalgia whenever I reminisce 
about it, as well as a feeling that, 
ultimately, it impacted my life in 
a profound way.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

We live in an age where 
it’s hard to find the soul of 
America. Much of American 
society is disheartened by the 
current administration, and if 
not that, the general state of 
the world as it is. There seems 
to be a new headline every day 
that could easily make one lose 
faith in his or her country — 
but even with all this, its heart 
is still there, hidden beneath 
layers of history and tradition. 
That deep American tradition 

can be easily found where folk 
music plays, these layers peel 
back to show the core which 
lies beneath.
On night two of the Ann 
Arbor Folk Festival, hosted 
by local folk venue The Ark 
in Hill Auditorium, this core 
was celebrated by a sold-out 
crowd of folk lovers and music 
aficionados 
alike. 
Saturday 

night’s host of acts fused the 
traditions of blues, country 
and rock into one massive 
celebration of music itself, 
of community and the act 
of singing with friends and 
family late into the night. 
Headlined by the legendary 
folk songwriter John Prine, 
the show was a masterful set 
of acts that varied in influence 
and genre, but all had one 
thing in common — a whole 
lotta soul.
The Festival’s emcee, Joe 
Pug, brought it all together 

seamlessly, playing his own 
songs acoustically to string 
one act to the next in a smooth 
line of guitar and harmonica. 
The first act, Michigan-based 
blues duo The War and Treaty, 
brought the house down with 
songs including “Hi Ho” and 
“Til 
the 
Morning,” 
Tanya 
Blount and Michael Trotter 
Jr.’s voices blending into each 
other as if they were always 
meant to do so. The level of 
vocal skill and soul in their 
music is seemingly endless, as 
each line of harmony ducks 
into the other and back, a 
woven textile of grit and beauty 

that could make anyone feel 
limitless. The War and Treaty 
finished their set to a standing 
ovation of whoops and hollers, 
and for good reason.
Next to grace Hill’s stage 
were brothers Page Burkum 
and Jack Torrey of The Cactus 
Blossoms 
and 
their 
band. 
Similar to The War and Treaty, 
Burkum and Torrey’s voices 

merged into one for their 
set of traditional country-
inspired songs, one of which, 
“Mississippi,” 
was 
featured 
on last year’s reboot of David 
Lynch’s “Twin Peaks.” The 
group switched easily between 
high-tempo and slow songs, 
both brothers playing guitar to 
create a big sound, in volume 
and emotional effect.
After The Cactus Blossoms 
was folk group Birds of Chicago, 
based out of — you guessed it 
— Chicago, fronted by couple 
JT Nero and Allison Russell, 

who travel the country playing 
music with their daughter Ida 
in tow. This familial spirit 
made its mark on Hill, with the 
first half of haunting ballad 
“Barley” sung a cappella into 
the auditorium by Russell, 
making 
the 
musical 
kick-
in even more powerful. The 
combined efforts of Nero and 
his wife spun a rich American 
tradition 
of 
storytelling 
together with modern themes, 
bringing folk into the new age 
with tunes like “American 
Flowers,” 
which 
emphasize 
classic song structure while 
beautifully sending a message 

of togetherness. In the words 
of Nero, “I’ve found traveling 
the country that most people 
are good people; that common 
decency should be a jumping 
off point for arguing.”
Mountain Heart took the 
stage after Birds of Chicago, 
immediately 
beginning 
an 
extensive instrumental intro 
that showed off the crazy 

technical skill of each member 
of the folk group. With several 
of Heart’s musicians playing 
more than one instrument, 
the electric energy of their 
set was unmistakable, a truly 
polished example of bluegrass 
and folk music that brought 
the audience to their feet. 
The 
sounds 
of 
mandolin, 
double bass and the smooth 
voice of singer Josh Shilling 
echoed into Hill with joy and 
harmony; their set was a huge 
success, ending in a standing 
ovation.

Folk Fest night two brings out Ann Arbor’s soul

When most people are asked 
about their childhoods, they 
envision good times filled 
with family and friends, the 
first time they rode their 
bike or that important soccer 
game that they won. Instead 
of daydreaming of memories 
when 
asked 
about 
my 
childhood, the sound of Latin 
music fills my mind. Growing 
up in a Dominican household, 
every moment in our house 
was filled with the sound of 
Latin rhythms.
Latin music itself reflects 
the history of the people that 
it comes from. It is a mix 
of smooth and syncopated 
African rhythms, combined 
with the sounds of the native 
people 
and 
the 
European 
influences that invaded their 
land. Our music has traveled 
far and wide, immigrating 
to find new inspiration from 
different places around the 
globe. We learned from these 
places and cultures, and we 
picked up new sounds along 
the way, incorporating them 
into our own.
It is complex, and it refuses 
to be put into boxes of African 
beats or Spanish melodies. 
Instead, it combines these 
elements and more to create 
a sound that is unique and 
distinct among other types of 
music. Latin music, no matter 
if it’s reggaeton or salsa, has 
many different origins and 
flavors that are united into 
one beautiful soundscape that 
has helped to shape the Latin 
cultures that exist today.
Music is a way that we 
stay in touch with our roots, 
despite our tendencies to drift 
away from our homelands. 

Neighborhoods 
filled 
with 
Latinx immigrants are marked 
by radios blasting sounds of 
distant lands. It unites us as 
a community when we are far 
away from our home countries. 
I 
remember 
sleepovers 
at 
my 
abuela’s 
apartment 
in 

the 
Washington 
Heights 
neighborhood in Manhattan, 
falling asleep to the sound of 
the deep Conga drums blasting 
from a radio across the alley — 
a lullaby gifted to me by my 
African ancestors.
The music reminds us that 
we are poetic and intelligent 
people. Spanish sounds, the 
purring of a rolled “r,” the 
softness of the vowels — they 
enhance the beauty of the 
poetry behind the lyrics. I 
remember my father gently 

stroking his Spanish guitar in 
our living room, while I stared 
in awe at the romance that the 
sound produced — riffs that 
were brought to me by my 
Spanish roots — his thick, dark 
eyebrows gently narrowing 
over his green eyes as he gently 
improvised Spanish lyrics.
On the windowsill in our 
living room sat a bumpy tin 
column and next to it a tin 
instrument 
that 
resembled 
a hair pick with a wooden 
handle. 
This 
instrument, 
called a güiro, was my favorite 
growing up. I would dance 
around my apartment to the 
rhythms I scraped on the güiro, 
an instrument whose harsh 
metallic sounds entertained 
me 
for 
hours. 
My 
Taino 
ancestors communicated their 
lost culture with me through 
the sounds of the güiro.
Nothing 
will 
amount 
to those nights when my 
family would reunite and the 
celebratory sounds of bachata, 
salsa and merengue inspired us 
to let go of all our stresses and 
enjoy each other’s company to 
the rhythm of the clave. The 
music controlled our bodies, 
moving our hips and feet in 
a way that Latinx are most 
known for. It is our music 
that reminded us that we are 
family, whether we are related 
by blood or not, and that 
when our differences come 
together, we form a sound that 
is unmatched by any other in 
history. A sound of family, 
multiple origins, poetry and 
unity. When I think of my 
childhood, I think of not only 
the sounds that surrounded 
me everywhere I went, but the 
lessons that these sounds have 
taught me in creating their 
own remarkable identity that 
reflects the Latinx community 
from which they come.

The sounds of my Latin 
childhood are speaking

Jonathan Coulton on for a few 
songs off of Mental Illness, 
of which he co-wrote several 
songs with the performer, and 
they brought the show back to 
its roots, singing slow, acoustic 
tunes inspired by classic folk. 
To quote Mann, “I wanted it 
to sound like John Denver, 
but a little less edgy.” The 
bellowing warmth of bass and 
dreadnought guitar closed her 
set with power, the audience 

erupting into applause as she 
jaunted off stage.

Though 
the 
talent 
and 
emotional poignancy of all 
of the festival’s performers 
made a strong mark on the 
night, no one can do folk quite 
like headliner and legendary 
songwriter John Prine. At 
the ripe age of 71, Prine still 
performs like a young man, 
cracking 
jokes 
in 
between 
lyrics woven into acoustic and 
electric guitar. Accompanied 

by a band of incredibly skilled 
musicians, the sounds of the 
lap steel and upright bass 
supported Prine’s masterful 
storytelling on classic songs 
like “Sam Stone” and “Angel 
From Montgomery.” As folk 
reverberated 
against 
the 
ornate 
auditorium’s 
walls, 
the 
songwriter 
brought 
thousands of people together 
to celebrate the music that 
raised, saved or even just found 
them accidentally. In Prine’s 
experience, he said, “Being 
loved is much better than the 
other thing — let’s do more of 
that.” The songwriter closed 
the festival on a note of hope 
and unity with folk standard 
“Paradise,” bringing all of the 
show’s performers on stage 
for a triumphant finish that 
inspired a feeling of hope and 
happiness in the audience. No 
matter what your background 
or musical taste, it was clear 
what a community folk has 
built in Ann Arbor — America’s 
soul was in Hill Saturday night, 
the sound of voices joined in 
joyful noise.
