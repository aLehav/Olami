As the first day of fall 

semester 
approaches 
and 

students move into on-campus 
residence 
halls, 
freshmen 

have 
had 
to 
modify 
their 

expectations 
for 
what 
the 

semester will now look like. 

LSA 
freshman 
Elizabeth 

Wolfe, who lives in East Quad 
Residence Hall, said she has 
tried to make her first several 
days as normal as possible 
despite the semester’s clear 
differences.

“Interactions 
have 
been 

limited but I’ve kind of found 
ways to just sit with people 
in the courtyard, be able to 
eat food with people socially 
distanced,” Wolfe said. “I guess 
the way I look at it is it’s not 
gonna be what freshman year 
would normally be but it just 
makes it into a new experience 
and I’m just trying to make the 
most of that.”

With reports of many move-

in policies going unchecked or 
abandoned, many freshmen are 
fearful of a COVID-19 outbreak 
impacting students and classes 
shortly after the start of the 
semester. The first two cases 
of COVID-19 in residence halls 
were seen in West Quad this 
week.

Wolfe said the idea of an 

outbreak on campus is even 
more worrying to her due to 
her preexisting condition. 

“I’m really concerned,” Wolfe 

said. “For me personally, I have 
asthma so I’ve been trying to 
take a lot of precautions.”

Additionally, 
Wolfe 
said 

starting school almost entirely 
online adds extra difficulty to 
the first year experience.

“I’m a little anxious about 

starting with online classes 
just because it was really 
difficult to do that at the end of 

senior year (of high school) on 
such short notice,” Wolfe said. 
“But I trust the teachers here to 
do what’s right. I have a lot of 
confidence in them right now.”

Kinesiology 
freshman 

Lauren Nemeh added that the 
difficulty with transitioning to 
online instruction and learning 
at the end of last year makes 
her more concerned for the 
upcoming school year.

“With the second half of 

my senior year online, in some 
of my classes it was definitely 
tough because teachers were 
really unsure about what was 
happening too,” Nemeh said. 
“And it was hard because 
some of my teachers were 
super lenient with deadlines 
and were just like ‘get this in 
when you can,’ but others were 
trying to make it as close to the 
actual in-person (experience) 
as possible.”

According 
to 
Wolfe, 
the 

biggest 
change 
between 

student 
activity 
during 
a 

normal semester and now has 
been in their social lives rather 
than in academics.

“In terms of just day-to-day 

stuff, I think things have been 
pretty normal, just getting into 
a college routine and getting 
ready for classes to start next 
week,” Wolfe said. “So I think 
besides the social aspect, so far 
academically, things have been 
pretty normal.”

Wolfe said she understands 

the urge for students to make 
the semester as normal as 
possible, 
but 
worries 
that 

it might interfere with the 
following of guidelines.

“For the freshman class, we 

missed out on a lot,” she said. 

“We missed the end of our 

senior year (of high school), 
we missed graduation and our 
proms and I think that can 
kind of be taken two separate 
ways. I think for some people 
that was more of a motivator 

to be really responsible during 
this time and to try to not 
miss out on anything else. But 
I think people can also take 
that experience and want to 
compensate for that lost time, 
and they are going to go out and 
party.”

However, Wolfe, like many 

other students, did not consider 
taking a year off before starting 
school, explaining that the 
uncertainty of the pandemic 
made this a difficult choice to 
make.

“My family asked me about 

maybe taking a gap year but I 
really didn’t want to,” Wolfe 
said. “I just wanted to get 
right into freshman year. I 
didn’t want to take a break 
because I didn’t think it would 
be productive. It wouldn’t be 
likely that I could even get a 
job. I didn’t want to be sitting 
around for a year just waiting 
for things to get back (to 
normal).”

According 
to 
Nemeh, 

students living in the dorms 
have found ways to meet each 
other in safe ways by interacting 
outside and wearing masks.

“There’s 
definitely 
a 
lot 

more people walking around 
than I imagined,” Nemeh said. 
“I saw a bunch of people out 
there 
(Hill 
Neighborhood) 

playing basketball and tennis. 
So it looks like people are kind 
of hanging out that way and 
trying to meet new people.”

Nemeh said residence hall 

GroupMe 
chats 
have 
been 

helpful for students to meet 
one another.

“In 
GroupMes 
for 
East 

Quad where I live and my 
floor, 
people 
are 
always 

texting, ‘Hey, anyone wanna 
go to the basketball courts or 
something?’’ Nemeh said.

Freshmen make the best of an 
unprecedented fall semester

Arriving on campus for the start of courses, new students try to 
adjust to college life in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic

BEN ROSENFELD

Daily News Editor

Faculty members are preparing 

for a fall semester at the University 
of Michigan like no other.

For the majority of faculty 

members, 
this 
semester 
will 

require teaching over Zoom or 
preparing materials to upload to 
Canvas if their courses are taught 
entirely asynchronously. But others 
will teach face-to-face in socially 
distanced classrooms.

Instructors 
across 
the 

University’s different schools and 
departments are still set to teach 
in person, despite some faculty 
pushback against the University’s 
reopening 
plans. 
Professor 

Kentaro 
Toyama 
organized 
a 

protest outside of the Fleming 
Administrative Building after an 
open letter requesting greater 
transparency from the University 
went unanswered.

“I think, as instructors, what 

we would really like to see is the 
administration recognizing that 
we’re doing the hard work on the 
front lines and listening to our 
concerns,” Toyama said.

Toyama is teaching a 500-level 

course in the School of Information 
in the fall, which will have the 
option of in-person discussions 
and office hours for students who 
wish to meet face to face. Despite 
electing to make his course hybrid, 
Toyama said he does not believe the 
University will make it through the 
semester without having to go fully 
online.

“I don’t believe we should be 

having an in-person, in-residence 
semester,” Toyama said. “But if 
we’re going to do it, I think we 
need to do it as safely as possible. 
We probably need to test more 
often, we need to make sure that 
everyone’s wearing masks and 
socially distancing and so forth.”

In June, University President 

Mark Schlissel announced the 
in-residence 
semester, 
with 

on-campus housing opening and 
a mix of in-person, hybrid and 
remote classes being offered. This 
plan is still in place, with residents 
moving in this week and classes 
starting Monday.

Around 
31 
percent 
of 

undergraduate classes are set to 
be taught in an in-person or hybrid 
format. The School of Public 
Health and LSA are among those 
with the lowest percentages of 

in-person instruction, while the 
School of Nursing has some of the 
highest rates.

In an interview with The Daily 

on Wednesday, Schlissel said going 
fully online would not make much 
of a difference, given the large 
percentage of classes already taught 
remotely, but he is hopeful the few 
classes that require students to be 
on campus remain in person.

“Going fully remote is a pretty 

incremental difference from where 
we are right now,” Schlissel said. “It 
wouldn’t have left people at home. 
We’d still have lots of students in 
Ann Arbor, and we’d still have the 
challenge of working with students 
to help everybody understand 
what it takes to be safe from being 
infected and from transmitting the 
disease.”

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
the 
union 

representing 
graduate 
student 

instructors on campus, has started 
impact bargaining ahead of the fall 
semester, calling for a guarantee 
of their members’ right to a safe 
workplace amid the pandemic.

In 
the 
main 
hallway 
of 

Markley Residence Hall is a 
selection of large blue move-in 
bins. Standing next to the bins is 
a portable whiteboard sign with 
a hand-written message: “Please 
wipe before & after use!” On the 
floor lies a tube of disinfectant 
wipes, empty. 

This 
week, 
thousands 
of 

students 
are 
moving 
into 

University of Michigan residence 
halls. 
Students 
still 
have 

roommates, highly contaminable 
areas like bathrooms are still 
cleaned twice a day and social 
distancing is difficult to regulate 
in the narrow hallways.

Even 
on 
paper, 
the 

University has taken a less 
aggressive approach than other 
universities. 
By 
opening 
at 

about 70 percent capacity while 
closing all shared spaces, the 
measures that the University is 
taking puts its residential plan in 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s “more risk” 
category.

Bowdoin College has reduced 

its capacity down to 40% and is 
requiring residents to be tested 
every other day during move-in 
and twice per week throughout 
the semester. Harvard University 
has 
instituted 
a 
phased 

introduction to campus for its 
residents that requires students 
to have three negative tests. The 
University of California Berkeley 
has converted all of its rooms to 
single occupancy. Michigan State 
University has told students they 
shouldn’t return to campus. 

In practice, many of the 

measures that the University 
says it’s taking are not being 
enforced, leaving some students 
confused and concerned.

Amir 
Baghdadchi, 

senior 
associate 
director 

of 
the 
University 
Housing 

Administration, said spacing out 
time slots for students to move 
in is the most important change 
Housing is taking compared 
to previous years. Baghdadchi 
said time slots were assigned 
to ensure that roommates are 
not moving in at the same time 
to minimize contact between 
families. 

“Instead of moving about 

7,000 students in two and a half 
days, we’ll be moving thousands 
of students over seven days,” 
Baghdadchi said. “Then we used 

what we use every year: time 
slots. This actually allows us 
to really regulate the number 
of people that will be arriving 
up to the curb and going into a 
building at one time.”

The University’s new policy 

allows only one guest at a 
time to accompany a resident 
inside residence halls, which 
Baghdadchi 
said 
will 
limit 

congestion 
in 
spaces 
like 

elevators. 

“We’re really thinking about 

one family at a time, one student 
at a time, one helper at a time,” 
Baghdadchi said.

But The Daily — and freshmen 

moving in such as Business 
freshman Anupama Yetukuri 
— 
saw 
multiple 
parents, 

siblings and other relatives all 
accompany students. 

“We definitely saw lots of 

people who just had their whole 
families,” Yetukuri said.

LSA freshman Ashna Mehra 

said she moved into her residence 
hall room at the same time as her 
roommates and their families. 

Regarding the rule of only two 

people in an elevator at once, LSA 
freshmen Meghan Dodaballapur 
and Josie McCarthy said this 
isn’t being enforced either. 

Yetukuri said it seems to 

her that compliance with the 
University’s move-in policies is a 
matter of choice. 

“If you choose to do it, you’re 

doing it,” Yetukuri said. 

LSA freshman Laura Topf 

agreed: “There’s just no follow-
through.”

This includes the University’s 

mask requirement. The Daily 
saw students and guests in East 
Quad, South Quad, Markley and 
Oxford residence halls walking 
around hallways and sitting in 
common spaces maskless, even 
with Housing staff nearby.

The University’s testing plan, 

which 
has 
faced 
skepticism 

from public health experts for 
not being extensive enough, 
requires that all residents test 
negative 
before 
coming 
to 

campus. However, Topf said 
that requirement is also loosely 
enforced.

“We took tests, and they said 

to print it out and have it with us, 
but they never asked me for my 
test results,” Topf said.

Baghdadchi said students are 

encouraged to “stop by” other 
students’ rooms and “drop into 
the doorway.” However, he said 
that “socializing needs to be 

socially distant, really outside 
the room.” 

Baghdadchi 
suggested 

students meet in the common 
areas within the residence halls. 
However, the University has 
closed these common areas. 

Baghdadchi said students are 

encouraged to meet outdoors, 
which, as he noted, would put 
them outside the purview of 
Michigan Housing. According to 
Baghdadchi, as long as residents 
are socially distanced, they are 
encouraged to explore campus as 
they would any other year.

“We imagine a lot of students 

will be doing what students do 
every single year,” Baghdadchi 
said. “Move-in comes around 
— it’s at a ripe moment in the 
summer — and the first thing 
students do is they go out on 
campus and explore it, which 
is what they exactly should do. 
Going out and experiencing 
campus outdoors is a low-risk 
activity.”

The days surrounding move-

in, which students refer to as 
“Welcome Week,” are usually 
chock-full of round-the-clock 
parties and extravagant social 
events. While Welcome Week 
may be toned down this year, 
some 
off-campus 
parties 

continue. 

Residents are required to 

adhere to all Ann Arbor city and 
University 
guidelines, 
which 

includes a 25-person limit on 
outdoor gatherings. When asked 
what the University is doing to 
prevent residents from attending 
parties, Baghdadchi said it is 
up to students to adhere to the 
Housing contract. 

“Ultimately, students have to 

make choices,” Baghdadchi said. 
“When you choose to live with 
us, you’re choosing to follow 
the standards. And if you’re 
not interested in following the 
standards, then you’re also not 
interested in living in Michigan 
Housing.”

Baghdadchi 
said 
students 

understand 
that 
exercising 

caution is central to the success 
of the University’s in-residence 
semester.

“I think they fundamentally 

understand there is a connection 
between what they do outside 
the residence hall and whether 
we can have a residence hall,” he 
said.

But once a student is dropped 

off, the University has little 
control over residents’ behavior. 

For some residents, this is a 
cause for confusion and fear. For 
others, it’s an invitation to act 
freely. 

For example, LSA freshman 

Ryan Mulliken, who moved in on 
Tuesday, said he would be open 
to attending fraternity parties. 
Mulliken said he contracted 
COVID-19 
in 
March, 
and 

therefore “I wouldn’t say that 
I’m worried, because again, I’ve 
had it.” 

Mulliken acknowledged that 

his antibodies do not guarantee 
immunity. He said he would be 
careful because he’s worried 
about the fate of the semester but 
that he’s still hoping to go out.

Topf said it’s unclear what 

students are and are not allowed 
to do. 

“They never went over the 

rules,” Topf said. “There’s no one 
in the halls making sure people 
don’t go into other people’s 
rooms. There’s a big group of 
freshmen sitting in a circle close 
to each other with no masks on.”

Yetukuri said she is concerned 

about 
students 
socializing 

unsafely. She said enforcement 
from the University is ineffective 
in preventing her and her peers 
from partying.

“The only reason I wouldn’t go 

is because I don’t want (COVID-
19),” Yetukuri said. 

When 
Resident 
Advisors 

pushed administration to give 
them more testing in a town hall 
with the Housing and Student 
Life 
offices, 
Robert 
Ernst, 

director of University Health 
Service, said, “Having a test 
doesn’t prevent you from getting 
COVID.” Ernst’s comments on 
testing, as well as University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s, 

have been questioned by several 
public health experts.

Topf said she had hoped 

she could count on University 
officials and staff, but her 
experience with move-in has 
shown her she can’t. 

“I wish I wouldn’t have to 

depend on other 17-year-olds 
to be safe and that I could trust 
teachers will help us and other 
adults, but it’s just not the case,” 
Topf said.

After 
speaking 
with 
The 

Daily 
Tuesday, 
Baghdadchi 

wrote in an email to The Daily 
Wednesday 
that 
Michigan 

Housing is “recalibrating some 
of the policies.”

Precautions go unenforced as 
students move into residence halls

‘There’s just no follow-through’: Health protocols subject to lax oversight 
as new occupants fill dorms across University of Michigan campus

Most University of Michigan 

students have yet to move back to 
Ann Arbor, but some were already 
partying Sunday through Tuesday 
as the pandemic rages on. 

These parties do not bode well 

for Friday and Saturday night, the 
two busiest going-out nights on 
campus and when most students 
who plan on returning will have 
moved in. 

The 
Daily’s 
reporters 
saw 

multiple parties near campus and 
many maskless groups walking 
around dressed for a night out 
Sunday and Monday. With classes 
set to begin in less than a week, 
the issue of off-campus parties 
has turned students against one 
another, prompting heated debates 
on social media and in group chats 
of University students. 

Out of almost 1,800 incoming 

freshmen surveyed anonymously 
by The Daily mid-August, 31.7 
percent said they’d be very 
comfortable 
to 
somewhat 

comfortable going to a house party 
despite COVID-19.

Even if the vast majority of 

students refrained from partying, 
unsafe gatherings can account for 

a significant chunk of the student 
body. Out of the University’s 
roughly 30,000 undergraduates, 
even if only 1 percent chose to 
party, that would still total 300 
students. 

Viral Party Photograph
A photo of an outdoor party 

Sunday night with the banner 
“You can’t eat ASS with a mask 
on” sparked much conversation 
on social media. Many said in 
replies to the original tweet that 
they were disappointed but not 
surprised.

Information graduate student 

Daniella Raz captured the viral 
photograph while she was walking 
home. She said she saw the party at 
about 9:30 p.m. Sunday night.

She said the banner proves some 

students don’t plan on following 
public health guidelines.

“The big banner (makes) light 

of a pandemic that has killed so 
many Americans,” Raz said. “This 
behavior was inevitable after the 
University’s decision to bring 
students back to campus, and the 
administration should reconsider 
their course of action.”

Another banner in the photo 

referenced 
Phi 
Kappa 
Psi, 

prompting speculation that the 
party was fraternity-affiliated. 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 

Broekhuizen said Phi Kappa Psi 

was not involved in the gathering.

In an email to The Daily, 

Broekhuizen said the gathering 
“was of individuals who are 
believed to be members of the 
same household. Their socializing 
behavior would be in alignment 
with public health guidance as 
well as within the 25 person limit 
for outdoor gatherings.”

She 
wrote 
that 
Michigan 

Ambassadors 
have 
“provided 

education” to students gathered at 
the home. 

“While the content of the 

banners does not reflect positively 
on the residents, the university 
or our public-health efforts, it is 
speech that is protected by the 
first amendment,” Broekhuizen 
wrote. “The banner was removed 
immediately 
by 
the 
house 

occupants. The university is in 
the process of doing additional 
followup and education with the 
students involved.”

Broekhuizen 
wrote 
that 

the 
University 
“thoroughly 

condemns” 
those 
who 
are 

harassing and threatening the 
students at this party.

Rackham student Joe Meadows 

said the photo of a party happening 
on campus represents a lack of 
empathy overall.

“If 
people 
haven’t 
been 

personally affected by this, then 

they don’t seem to take it too 
seriously,” Meadows said. “And for 
me personally, as someone who’s 
lost a couple friends to this since 
March, that just smacks of apathy 
of other people’s experiences.”

Regulation 
of 
off-campus 

behavior

In its efforts to regulate student 

behavior, the University has rolled 
out a program in which teams of 
students, faculty, staff and police 
officers walk around campus daily 
from noon to midnight to remind 
students to adhere to public health 
guidelines and to break up unsafe 
gatherings. 

The 
program, 
known 
as 

Michigan 
Ambassadors, 
has 

drawn backlash for its perceived 
lack of enforcement mechanisms 
and for working with local 
police, 
though 
Broekhuizen 

and University President Mark 
Schlissel have said it is designed 
to 
reduce 
reliance 
on 
law 

enforcement.

The University also updated its 

Statement of Students Rights and 
Responsibilities, which Schlissel 
said could be used to give students 
a citation and a fine after multiple 
warnings.

As students return to Ann Arbor,

Thousands protest police 
brutality across Michigan

CLAIRE HAO & CALDER

Daily News Editor and Summer 

News Editor

Last weekend, The Michigan 

Daily reporters went to 11 
different protests, driving 269 
miles and speaking to almost 
100 people in 10 cities about 
why they came out. Some said it 
was their first time protesting. 
Many more said they were used 
to protests in big cities, but 
they never expected protests 
of this magnitude — or even 
protests in general — in their 
suburban hometowns. When 
asked if not before, why now, 
almost everyone had the same 
answer: People are tired, and 
they want change. 

This article is the first 

installment 
of 
a 
four-part 

series 
on 
police 
brutality 

protests across Metro Detroit 
over the weekend of June 6 and 
7. Check back at michigandaily.
com this week for parts two, 
three and four. 

It was a sight many said 

they thought they’d never see. 

Ulysses Wright and Charlie 

Evans were working at the 
Hungry Howie’s in Ferndale 
on Saturday afternoon when 
thousands started flooding 
past their storefront window, 
marching in protest of police 
brutality. 
The 
two 
went 

outside to take in the sight, 
which left them speechless 
and nearly moved Wright to 
tears. Wright said the crowd 
meant so much to him because 
he is a Black man in America, 
but also because he has never 
seen people come together 
like this.

“It makes me want to cry, 

like you don’t really care 
about anything else in the 
world,” Wright said. “I think 
the world kind of stopped 
for me, and I’ve never had 
that feeling. There was no 
existence except taking it all 
in. It’s hard to put it in words, 
because that’s just cheapening 
it. It was like literally if God 
himself came to show us he 
was God, that was it.”

Over the weekend, tens 

of thousands wore masks to 
march in suburbs throughout 
Metro Detroit against police 
brutality, 
joining 
millions 

across the country and around 
the world in wave after wave 
of protests sparked by the 
killing of George Floyd.

Throughout the latter half 

of the 1900s, the growth of 
the suburbs often came at 
Detroit’s expense, as capital 
and white residents moved 
out of the city in droves 
while Black residents were 
prevented 
from 
following. 

To this day, Detroit is unique 
among 
other 
metropolitan 

hubs across the country in 
that much of the wealth is 
concentrated in its outlying 
suburbs rather than in the 
city itself. 

The 
majority 
of 
those 

arrested in the first several 
days 
of 
Detroit’s 
protests 

lived in the suburbs. Through 
the 
week, 
protests 
began 

spreading 
to 
Detroit’s 

suburbs, many of which are 
predominantly white. 

According 
to 
Sterling 

Heights 
resident 
Megan 

Williams, her ancestors had 
been slaves and her mother 
had 
walked 
with 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. She marched 
in 
her 
very 
first 
protest 

in 
Ferndale 
on 
Saturday 

afternoon.

“We don’t want to repeat 

cycles,” Williams said. “I 
refuse to birth a child into a 
world where they have to do 
any more than us.”

Below are some of the 

protesters 
from 
Saturday 

on their experiences with 
racism and what this current 
moment means to them. You 
can read more from protesters 
on Saturday in Part Two of 
this series coming soon. 

12 p.m. - Bloomfield Hills 

- 82.3 percent white and 2.21 

percent Black - $187k median 
household income

Despite its small size, the 

group of about 20 people 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
the 

Bloomfield 
Hills 
police 

station was hard to miss. They 
held signs condemning police 
brutality as some cars driving 
by honked in support.

Southfield residents Nate 

and Tamika Taylor brought 
their 
two 
young 
sons 
to 

protest 
along 
Long 
Lake 

Road. Both said they were out 
to push for a better world for 
their kids.

“We just thought it was 

disheartening in today’s age 
when you see an African-
American male lose his life on 
television,” Nate Taylor said. 
“That’s something I didn’t 
want to show my boys, but it’s 
something that they need to 
know goes on in this world. 
We just want to make sure 
they’re treated fairly as they 
grow and progress into young, 
African-American men.”

Berkley 
resident 
Starr 

Bialk, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan 
alum, 
said 
she 

thought the roadside protest 
was 
important 
because 

even 
a 
small 
number 
of 

people showing up is visible. 
According to Bialk, because 
Bloomfield Hills is a “really 
white, upper-class part of the 
area,” it felt to her like one of 
the more important places to 
bring the Black Lives Matter 
message.

“If people aren’t here, it’s 

maybe easier for people to 
avoid it, if they don’t want to 
be a part of it,” Bialk said. “If 
you bring it to them instead, it 

shows them they can’t avoid 
it. It’s everywhere and it’s 
happening.”

2 p.m. - Southfield - 22.8 

percent 
white 
and 
70.3 

percent Black - $54k median 
household income

A few hundred protesters 

met in Southfield at Hope 
United 
Methodist 
Church 

before marching down Civic 
Center Drive.

Detroit Resident Ronisha 

Bannerman 
said 
the 

Southfield protest was more 
soothing than the ones she had 
attended in Detroit. 

“Those 
(Detroit 
protests) 

were rowdy, more upbeat,” 
Bannerman said. “This one 
was more chill, and I really 
appreciated that. There was 
gospel music playing, and it 
was really calming for me. The 
one downtown had me really 
pumped up, this one was more 
laidback. It was what I needed 
today.”

Southfield 
resident 
Myra 

Gracey, a retired Detroit police 
officer, 
participated 
in 
the 

march because she wants to 
see more reform, training and 
professional development in 
police departments. She said 
high-profile police killings like 
George Floyd’s are not lost on 
officers.

“Being 
a 
retired 
police 

officer, 
what 
happened 

probably 
affected 
us 
more 

mentally than others, because 
we all have the job to protect 
people,” Gracey said. “Killing 
people with our hands is very 

upsetting and disappointing.” 

Royal Oak resident Erika 

Swilley said she thought it was 
important to have protests in 
the suburbs to challenge all 
the police departments in the 
different neighborhoods. To 
her, taking a stance by coming 
to Southfield’s protest was an 
opportunity to not only talk the 
talk but also to literally walk 
the walk.

“(The protest) was just a 

reflection of what our country 
can be,” Swilley said. “People of 
all ethnicities coming together 
for one common goal.”

2 p.m. - Royal Oak - 90.2 

percent white and 3.7 percent 
Black - $79k median household 
income 

The 
predominantly 
white 

protesters walked in circles 
under hanging flower baskets 
on Main Street from 11 Mile 
Road to Fifth Street, before 
marching down and closing a 
portion of 11 Mile Road. 

One 
protester, 
Detroit 

resident Karl Jackson, is a 
combat 
veteran 
who 
was 

deployed in 2013 and now back 
in civilian life. He said fighting 
for his country is one of the 
greatest things an American 
can do.

“Now, I’m fighting for my 

life as a Black man, and for 
my people here,” Jackson said. 
“We’re all Americans. When 
one of us hurts, we all hurt.”

Growing up as a boy in 

Detroit, Jackson said he knew 
not to go past certain suburbs at 
a certain time. Jackson likened 
the protective measures he has 
to take to his experience as a 
soldier.

“You may not have to take 

certain 
precautions 
driving, 

but as a Black man today I 
have to. You know, I have a 
veteran status on my license,” 
Jackson said. “I keep my phone 
positioned on the camera just 
in case. I keep my wallet where 
it’s visible. Those things are 
just like me being a soldier. I 
have to prepare myself, you 
never know.”

As a soldier, Jackson said 

he defended everybody’s First 
Amendment rights, whether 
he agreed with them or not. 
When 
asked 
his 
thoughts 

on former NFL player Colin 
Kaepernick’s controversial act 
of taking a knee in 2016 during 
the national anthem to protest 
police brutality, Jackson said 
the national anthem represents 
something “totally different” 
to him.

“As a Black soldier or a Black 

veteran, when I looked and saw 
what Colin Kaepernick did, I 
wasn’t looking at the fact that 
he was protesting the military,” 
Jackson said. “It was him using 
his right, which is what I raised 
my hand and defended the 
Constitution up to my life for.”

Among the stream of people 

in street clothes walking by, it 
was hard to miss the 20 doctors 
and medical students marching 
in their scrubs and white coats 
holding a sign that said “White 
Coats for Black Lives.” Many 
of them were from the family 
medicine unit at the Henry 
Ford hospital in Detroit. Those 
interviewed said they wanted 
to stand with and show their 
support for the community that 
they serve, one that is largely 
Black. 

Dr. Alicia Steele is a part 

of the inaugural class of the 
Wayne State University Urban 
Track in Family 

Medicine residency, and she 

is working to address health 
inequities and lack of access 
to health care for Detroit’s 
minority 
communities. 
She 

said every institution can have 
systemic racism and violence, 
specifically pointing to the 
disproportionate burden of 
COVID-19 
on 
Michigan’s 

Black community.

UMich community battles 
anti-Asian discrimination

FRANCESCA DUONG

Summer Managing News Editor

During the early days of 

the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 

Mary Rose, program manager 
in the Office of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion at the 
University of Michigan, felt 
her uneasiness grow about 
her public perception as she 
took her son to their local 
urgent care clinic. 

“I 
remember 
purposely 

wearing my Michigan t-shirt 
underneath my big winter 
coat,” Rose said. “As soon as I 
got inside I unzipped it. I felt 
like I had to consciously make 
an effort to indicate that I was 
not a recent immigrant, that I 
did not just come here off a 
plane from anywhere — I am a 
part of this community.”

Rose noted her thoughts 

were 
fueled 
by 
social 

media 
and 
reports 
of 

Asian 
Americans 
being 

discriminated 
against 
and 

said sometimes she hesitates 
to go out by herself. 

“I weigh in my mind, ‘Is 

there a chance that I let my 
guard down and I go out and 
somebody might harass me, 
or do something, and I might 
not be with my family?’” Rose 
said.

Melissa 
Borja, 
assistant 

professor 
of 
American 

culture, said she sometimes 
gets 
nervous 
about 
going 

outside, 
not 
only 
because 

she does not want to be 
infected, but also because 
she is concerned about racial 
harassment. 

“It just struck me as this 

great irony that in March and 

in April, we were living in 
lockdown situations and we 
were told ‘get out’, ‘get some 
fresh air,’ ‘it’s good for your 
mental health, once a day just 
go for a walk,’” Borja said. 
“But, it’s a very stressful thing 
to ‘get out,’ ‘get fresh air,’ ‘go 
on a walk,’ as an Asian person, 
since 
Asian 
people 
were 

getting spit on, were having 
racist things yelled at them by 
drivers passing by.”

According to the Center 

for Disease Control, on Jan. 
21, 2020, the first case of 
COVID-19 was identified in 
the United States.

In March, Secretary of 

State Mike Pompeo referred 
to the 2019 novel coronavirus 
as the “Wuhan virus” and 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

called COVID-19 the “China 
virus.” CDC Director Robert 
Redfield condemned the use 
of such language, saying it 
was “absolutely wrong and 
inappropriate.” 

As COVID-19 continued to 

spread, the Los Angeles Times 
reported a rise in hate crimes 
toward Asian Americans from 
February to April. The article 
echoed an FBI warning of the 
potential surge in hate crimes 
against 
Asian 
Americans 

during the pandemic. The 
warning detailed an incident 
in Midland, Texas, in which 
an 
Asian-American 
family 

was 
stabbed 
because 
the 

attacker “thought the family 
was Chinese, and infecting 
people with the coronavirus.”

Rose, 
Borja 
and 
many 

other University community 
members are taking action 
to combat the rise in anti-
Asian hate crimes and to 

raise awareness of racist and 
xenophobic acts. 

In this article, the acronyms 

AAPI 
(Asian 
Americans 

and Pacific Islanders), A/
PIA (Asian/Pacific Islander 
American) 
and 
APID/A 

(Asian Pacific Islander Desi/
Americans) will be frequently 
used. 

Documenting hate crimes 

across the U.S.

After 
being 
established 

on 
March 
19, 
the 
STOP 

AAPI 
HATE 
Reporting 

Center recieved 673 reports 
of 
COVID-19-related 

discrimination in the United 
States within the first week of 
opening.

Borja 
leads 
a 
team 
of 

researchers to analyze media 
coverage of anti-Asian hate 
incidents to understand the 
scope of these events for 
STOP AAPI HATE. University 
alum Jacob Gibson and LSA 
sophomore 
Amelia 
Navins 

are assisting Borja with the 
project. 

“We are going through news 

databases 
and 
identifying 

all articles we can that are 
related 
to 
Asian-American 

discrimination in relation to 
COVID-19,” Gibson said. “And 
then 
we’re 
tracking 
what 

the news stories are about, 
whether it’s about politician 
statements 
regarding 
anti-

Asian American racism or 
a statement that has been 
racist, or whether it’s been 
about individual incidents of 
harassment.”

Twitter account posts anon 
sexual assault allegations

JASMIN LEE & VARSHA 

VEDAPUDI

Summer Managing News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

Content 
Warning: 
Sexual 

assault, sexual abuse.

A Twitter account created 

Wednesday called “Assaulters 
at UMich” posted a series of 
tweets calling out alleged 
sexual 
assaulters 
on 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

campus, including a professor. 
The account asked for direct 
messages from students with 
claims of sexual assault and 
posted these submissions to 
their page with the name and 
picture of the alleged assaulter 
along with any fraternity or 
athletic team affiliation.

The Daily reached out to 

the creator of the account 
via direct message, whose 
identity cannot be verified and 
asked to remain anonymous 
due to safety concerns. The 
creator told The Daily via 
Twitter direct messages that 
they wanted to help survivors 
because the University has 
failed to protect survivors 
from their abusers.

“At first I wasn’t sure if 

people would send in their 
stories, but once individuals 
started sharing their stories 
I was shocked at the sheer 
amount of individuals who 
have 
gone 
through 
these 

(traumas),” they said. “It just 
shows how prevalent sexual 
assaults (are) and that UMich 
needs to do a better job taking 
action.” 

The creator said though 

they are not able to verify the 
submissions of alleged abuse 
that they are receiving, they 
are vigilant about deleting 
posts that are proven to be 
untrue.

The Daily reached out to 

the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 
at 

the University, who cited a 
statement from Public Affairs.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald told The Daily in an 
email they are not able to verify 
the validity of the accusations, 
and they encourage victims 
of sexual assault to report 
their 
experience 
through 

University resources.

“We 
encourage 
anyone 

who 
experiences 
sexual 

misconduct 
within 
our 

community to report it to 
police and OIE so the concerns 
can 
be 
thoroughly 
and 

appropriately 
investigated,” 

Fitzgerald said. “Anonymous 
reports 
are 
very 
difficult 

or impossible to investigate 
fully. We are not in a position 
to confirm or deny any of this 
information. We offer these 
resources 
and 
encourage 

community 
members 
to 

seek any support or other 
assistance they may need, 
even if they choose not to 
report to the university or 
police.”

University employees such 

as 
former 
provost 
Martin 

Philbert, late former athletic 
doctor Robert E. Anderson 
and 
former 
associate 

professor of music Stephen 
Shipps have been accused of 
sexual misconduct in the past. 
A sex discrimination lawsuit 
was recently filed by a former 
University athlete against the 
University and James Henry, 
a track and field coach. There 
has also been controversy 
surrounding 
cross-

examination guidelines with 
Title IX regulations, which 
can discourage survivors from 
reporting assault.

Students 
at 
other 

universities, 
such 
as 
the 

University of California at San 
Diego and the University of 
California at Los Angeles have 
created similar pages inspired 
by the “Assaulters at UMich” 
page to share experiences 
of sexual assault on their 
campuses. 

University alum Joy Boakye 

had 
her 
experience 
being 

sexually assaulted shared on 
the page. Her message on the 
page 
included 
accusations 

of people disregarding her 
allegations because of the 
accused’s prominent role in 
the Black community at the 
University. 

Boakye 
told 
The 
Daily 

in an email that she feared 
reinforcing 
the 
harmful 

stereotypes 
against 
people 

of color, and that she was 
concerned 
with 
furthering 

white supremacy which also 
affects women of color.

“I also think that this is an 

illustration of how race colors 
sexual 
violence,” 
Boakye 

said. “Survivors of color are 
discouraged or feel terrified 
to report because (it would) 
be reporting someone in the 
community and that looks like 
betrayal.”

Boakye also shared she 

did not reach out to any 
organizations with her story 
because of how exhausting it 
was to speak of her trauma. 
She said the incident left 
her “suicidal,” “broken” and 
caused her to “sever ties 
with the Black community” 
because of how much more she 
claimed the accused person 
was valued than her. 

Boakye 
said 
having 

a 
leadership 
role 
in 
the 

University 
community 
has 

enabled assaulters to get away 
with crimes in the past. 

“If you are an athlete, if 

you are part of a fraternity, if 
you’re part of something that 
makes you the leaders and 
best, you know that you have 
the power to do whatever 
you want regardless of the 
consequences.” Boakye said.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Monday, August 31, 2020 — 5

LSA senior Dylan Gilbert 

was sitting in a class discussion 
with 
the 
other 
20-or-so 

members of her class, when her 
English professor Scott Lyons 
read out loud the N-word from a 
short story by American writer 
William 
Faulkner. 
Gilbert, 

uncomfortable 
with 
the 

situation, left the discussion 
that day.

Though the class carried on, 

the professor’s choice to read 
the racial slur and the student’s 
protest ultimately raised an 
ongoing 
academic 
debate: 

whether or not the use of racial 
slurs from academic text is 
appropriate in the classroom. 

In June 2020, around a year 

later, Gilbert told her story on 
Twitter, where she received 
an outpouring of support from 
fellow University of Michigan 
students, alumni, faculty and 
staff, many condemning the 
professor and the University 
for tolerating the behavior. 

“I 
was 
just 
kind 
of 

exhausted,” Gilbert told The 
Daily. “I don’t feel like I should 
have to sit in a room and have 
a non-Black person keep saying 
the N-word in front of me. So I 
just quietly packed up my stuff 
into my bag, walked out of class 
and did not say anything.”

Details 
of 
the 
incident 

surfaced 
amid 
a 
renewed 

national commitment against 
systemic 
racism, 
thereby 

calling 
into 
question 
the 

impact classrooms have on 
perpetuating racial injustice. 

“The 
environment 
wasn’t 

comfortable anymore,” Gilbert 
said. “I felt targeted in the 
environment, and I felt unsafe 
in the environment, and I 
didn’t feel like I was learning 
the way I needed to learn. So 
when you use racial slurs in the 
classroom, you’re taking away 
some sense of equality in the 
classroom because now a group 
of your students aren’t feeling 
the way they should be feeling 
to properly learn.”

Gilbert’s 
tweets 
also 

included screenshots of email 
exchanges between her and 
Lyons after the class, in which 
Lyons did not offer an apology 
but 
committed 
to 
“avoid 

uttering the word for the rest 
of the term.” For the next class 
period, according to Gilbert, 
Lyons 
assigned 
an 
article 

defending the use of the word.

“I’m not sure I understand 

the 
distinction 
between 

assigning a work with the 
n-word (written by a non-black 
writer and read by mostly non-

black readers) and reading it 
out loud -- imagination versus 
exhaulation? -- but I do take 
your point,” Lyons wrote in the 
email exchanges.

The Daily reached out to 

Lyons multiple times for a 
comment, but was referred to 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald.

“Students have a variety of 

ways to raise concerns about 
their classroom experiences,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email to 
The Daily. “In this case, these 
concerns are being addressed 
through 
the 
appropriate 

channels.”

This 
incident 
does 
not 

appear to be an isolated one, 
either. 
Universities 
across 

the country have struggled to 
address how professors should 
approach teaching racial slurs. 
Some institutions have taken 
to 
suspending 
professors 

for using racial slurs in an 
academic environment, while 
others have defended their use 
based on academic freedom.

English 
professor 
Susan 

Parrish often teaches texts 
from 
Southern 
literature, 

which can include epithets 
against various groups. She 
explained how voicing these 
slurs can harm the ability for 
students to learn effectively 
and feel respected in the 
classroom.

“The classroom is a space 

of analysis and a space of 
mutual learning and of (the) 
responsibility to (not only) 
take care of each other while 
challenging each other, but 
(also) challenging each other 
equally and fairly to increase 
our understanding,” Parrish 
said. “I also feel like epithets 
against any group … makes 
a 
classroom 
situation 
feel 

unequal and feel potentially 
hostile, and then it decreases 
certain students’ possibility to 
learn and to feel welcome and 
to feel like they belong.” 

Parrish 
said 
she 
usually 

addresses the use of offensive 
language at the start of the 
semester with her class. But 
ultimately, 
the 
violent 
and 

historical weight that many 
slurs 
against 
groups 
carry, 

Parrish explained, does not 
warrant saying the word.

“I think where I ultimately 

come down is that you can’t 
have 
a 
student-by-student 

decision about this, it has to 
be something we set up at the 
beginning that if there are 
(slurs) in the text that have 
been associated with violence, 
suppression or oppression, we 
should not spread those words,” 
Parrish 
said. 
“Students 
do 

have to look at them as they’re 
doing their reading, but there’s 
no reason that we have to give 
breath to those words in live 
time together.”

According 
to 
Vershawn 

Young, an African-American 
studies 
professor 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Waterloo 
in 

Ontario, Canada, banning the 
use of the N-word in classrooms 
is also not a solution.

After witnessing a similar 

situation in which a University 
of Waterloo professor used 
the N-word during class, the 
University of Waterloo released 
a statement in a June 2020 
article, saying the university 
“unequivocally believes there 
is no place for the use of the 
N-word in class, on campus or 
in our community.” 

In response, Young wrote an 

article describing the harmful 
effects of completely banning 
the use of the N-word in the 
classroom, explaining that it 
censors his language as a Black 
man and scholar. Prohibiting 
the use of the N-word, Young 
further 
explained 
in 
an 

interview 
with 
The 
Daily, 

provides a disservice to the 
cultural complexity of the word.

“If you ban the word and 

in text, especially African-
American cultural text, you 
are not only diminishing one 
way in which the word is used, 
but six or seven ways in which 
the word is used,” Young said. 
“You cannot get to an accurate 
interpretation or a deep cultural 
understanding if you ban the 
word or if you only say that 
the word can be the ‘N-word,’ 
because the ‘N-word’ itself does 
not capture the various ways 
in which the word functions in 
African-American culture.”

Young further noted that 

censorship of any kind should 
not be enforced without careful 
consideration of its impact on 
not only particular groups, as 
well as the very meaning the 
author was trying to convey. 

“I believe that there is an 

easy answer,” Young said. “The 
easy answer is yes, the word 
should be allowed to be used in 
very careful, pedagogical ways 
and not in casual conversation. 
But I think in instructional 
conversations and texts where 
the word appears, it should 
not be erased because when 
you erase it, it is not true to 
the author’s intentions, is not 
true to the author’s text and it 
changes the meaning.”

The University of Michigan’s 

Board of Regents passed the 
administration’s 2020-21 budget 
in a 5-2 vote during a special 
meeting 
Monday 
night, 
days 

after a 4-4 vote at their June 25 
meeting had appeared to sink 
proposed 
increases 
in 
tuition 

and fees. The approved budget 
includes a 1.9 percent increase in 
tuition for the Ann Arbor campus; 
a 3.9 percent increase for UM-Flint 
and UM-Dearborn; a 1.9 percent 
increase in room and board fees 
and a $50 COVID-19 student fee. 

 Regents Paul Brown (D), Jordan 

Acker (D), Ron Weiser (R), Mark 
Bernstein (D) and Michael Behm 
(D) voted in favor of the budget, 
with Brown and Acker changing 
their votes from Thursday. Regents 
Shauna Ryder Diggs (D) and Denise 
Ilitch (D) voted against the budget. 
Regent Katherine White (D) was 
not present, though she called in to 
vote for the proposed budget at the 
previous meeting.

 After the budget initially failed 

to pass on June 25, University 
President Mark Schlissel said he 
anticipated the budget proposal 
the executive team would present 
at the July Regents meeting would 
diminish or eliminate a tuition 
increase for the Ann Arbor campus.

 Schlissel explained that the 

Board called for the special meeting 
on Monday because, without a 
budget, the University would not be 
able to operate and continue paying 
employees in the new fiscal year, 
starting July 1. Half of the revenue 
from the tuition increase will go 
toward increasing financial aid to 
address the pandemic, according to 
Schlissel, and the new budget also 
doubled the funds provided to Flint 
and Dearborn campuses from $10 
million to $20 million. 

Schlissel defended the proposal 

and cited the University’s ongoing 
efforts to protect students and 
families from the pandemic and 
economic 
recession 
including 

COVID-19 testing, hiring freezes, 
the suspension of nonessential 
travel and spending, and the use of 
$400 million from the endowment.

 “We’re committed to do 

our very best to make sure that 
the COVID-19 pandemic does 
not result in a lost generation 
of students who are unable 
to continue or complete their 
Michigan education because of the 
circumstances we find ourselves 
in,” Schlissel said. 

Students have criticized the 

University for trying to increase 
tuition, claiming their learning 
experiences will not be the same 
with online classes and more 

students 
are 
now 
struggling 

financially due to the recession 
sparked by the pandemic.

After Schlissel’s introduction, 

most of the meeting was devoted to 
Regents explaining their support 
for or disapproval of the budget.

Weiser, who supported the 

budget last Thursday and on 
Monday, 
addressed 
demands 

made by students and activists to 
use the endowment to balance the 
budget and cover financial losses. 
He said much of the endowment 
funds are restricted to particular 
units of the University and thus 
cannot be redirected legally.

 “While we are a university 

that’s 
blessed 
by 
having 
an 

endowment that’s gonna give 
us 400 million dollars this year, 
most of that money is restricted 
to certain areas,” Weiser said. 
“… It’s not a 12 million (sic) dollar 
endowment where we can take 
the income and spread it, put it 
any place we want. We have legal 
and moral and federal policy and 
law obligations about how we can 
spend it.” 

 In opposition to the budget, 

Ryder Diggs criticized the proposal 
for continuing the trend of raising 
tuition when the public health 
and economic circumstances have 
deteriorated.

“The administrative leadership 

team believes that tuition should 
always increase annually,” Ryder 
Diggs said. “The principle is that 
students should share the burden 
of increased costs from payroll, 
energy, 
infrastructure, 
food 

and housing, and even in health 
crises such as the coronavirus 
pandemic. I do not agree. Now 
I’ve consistently voted in favor of 
tuition increases, but this year is 
unlike any other in our lifetimes. 
When a global health crisis evolves 
into an economic crisis, we should 
not increase our tuition.”

 Ilitch, who voted against the 

budget, said the value of a mostly 
remote education is diminished. 
She 
added 
the 
University’s 

administration projects a 50-50 
chance “(we) will not complete 
this semester.” 

 “With this uncertainty, why 

would we raise prices on our 
students and families during this 
crisis?” Ilitch said.

 Ilitch also read from an email 

sent to the Regents by Rackham 
student Sarah Bork, president of 
Rackham Student Government, in 
partnership with Amanda Kaplan 
and Sav Nandigama, president and 
vice president of Central Student 
Government. The email called 
for a cost of attendance freeze, 
removal of the proposed COVID-
19 fee from the budget and the end 
of the $500 international student 
fee passed in last year’s budget.

Acker said he voted yes on the 

budget because it contains new 
pledges to eliminate uncertainty 
and will not increase tuition for 
in-state students whose families 
make less than $120,000 per year. 

 
Though 
regular 
Regents 

meetings 
include 
scheduled 

public 
comment, 
Monday’s 

special meeting did not. Acker 
said, however, that his vote was 
not an endorsement of the special 
meetings process taken to pass the 
budget before July 1.

“I am extremely disappointed in 

the process over the last few days,” 
Acker said. “I feel it is extremely 
important to take public comments 
… The one thing that Regent Ilitch 
and I as (incoming) vice chair and 
chair have to really work on is to 
make sure the process is better 
going forward, with more public 
input, with more conversations 
about what the budget does, and 
most importantly, meeting the one 
area we must really improve next 
year, which is communication.” 

In Bernstein’s statement in 

support of the budget, he said 
the University’s sticker price is 
misleading, as most students do 
not pay the full price of tuition. 
He said one in four in-state 
undergrads — over 4,100 students 
— pay no tuition, and 100 percent 
of students with demonstrated 
financial need will not see their 
tuition and fees increased.

“So who does pay tuition?” 

Bernstein said. “Students who 
can, and therefore, in my opinion, 
should, and are getting one of 
the great bargains in higher 
education, paying about half of 
what out-of-state students pay 
… Fundamentally, I believe that 
lower 
income 
students 
who 

struggle to pay tuition can depend 
upon those who can to reduce the 
cost of their college education.”

Though Brown objected to the 

budget presented on July 25 out 
of concern that the Dearborn and 
Flint campuses would not receive 
adequate support, he said he was 
reassured after conversations with 
Schlissel and other staff members. 
He noted the increase in funding 
to Flint in Dearborn also impacted 
his decision to vote “yes.”

 
“I 
am 
an 
enthusiastic 

supporter of this budget,” Brown 
said. “I believe the investment of 
20 million dollars in our Flint and 
Dearborn campuses aligned with 
the chancellors’ strategic plans 
(and) created an unprecedented 
opportunity for those campuses 
to only increase the world class 
education 
provided 
at 
those 

schools so we can continue to say 
we are truly the leaders and best.”

WilmerHale investigation finds two decades of 
Philbert misconduct, several ‘U’ officials knew

WilmerHale 
released 
its 

88-page report of its independent 
investigation of allegations of sexual 
misconduct by former University 
of 
Michigan 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert Friday. The report found 
“significant evidence” that Philbert 
violated the University’s Sexual 
Harassment policy. It identified 
numerous times when University 
personnel 
and 
administration 

received 
information 
about 

Philbert’s sexual misconduct. 

“Two things are clear: First, 

there is significant evidence that 
Philbert engaged in a wide range 
of sexual misconduct, including 
sexual harassment, for at least 
fifteen years,” the report reads. 
“Second, 
neither 
OIE 
(Office 

of Institutional Equity) nor the 
senior leadership of the University 
understood the seriousness or 
the pervasiveness of Philbert’s 
misconduct.”

WilmerHale 
began 
its 

independent 
investigation 
in 

January 2020. After six months, 
WilmerHale 
investigators 

interviewed 
128 
people, 
some 

multiple times, including current 
and former employees, former 
students and current and former 
University administrators. 

The report finds that Philbert 

normalized 
his 
inappropriate 

behavior and intimidated women 
who may have sought to report him. 

“Philbert 
had 
expressly 

threatened some of them—one 
witness, who in fact was in a 
relationship with Philbert, told us 
that he said: ‘If you ever tell anyone 
about us, I will make sure you go 
down. I will destroy your career,’” 
the report reads.

The report alleges Philbert 

sexually 
harassed 
multiple 

members 
of 
the 
University 

community while he was an 
assistant professor, an associate 
dean, School of Public Health dean 
and provost. In his early years at 
the University, Philbert allegedly 
harassed women who worked in 
his research lab, making comments 
about their bodies, redirecting 
conversations toward sex and 

insisting on getting hugs. The 
report found Philbert engaged in 
simultaneous sexual relationships 
with at least two University 
employees, and sometimes more, 
during his tenure as Provost. He 
stored nude photos of these women 
on University-owned devices and 
had “sexual contact” with them in 
University offices often. 

The report was released to both 

the University and the public at 
the same time. In an email to The 
Daily, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University is 
reviewing the results from the 
report.

“We have just begun to carefully 

review the full report and take 
all of its findings into account,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “Yet, it is clear 
in the executive summary that 
the WilmerHale report – released 
publicly today at the same time it 
was shared with university officials 
– contains a shocking description 
of improper and unacceptable 
behavior by a university officer as 
well as failings by this institution. 
We will do everything in our 
power to prevent such misconduct 

from ever happening again at the 
University of Michigan.”

In 2003, a male lab employee, 

Tom Komorowski, was terminated 
by 
Philbert. 
He 
reported 
to 

University officials he was fired 
over a female lab employee because 
of her and Philbert’s close, personal 
relationship. 
A 
senior 
Public 

Health School faculty member 
questioned Philbert about the 
alleged relationship and did not 
find any indication of an improper 
relationship. A 2004 lawsuit by the 
male employee also did not find any 
such evidence. 

In 2005, specific allegations 

of 
sexual 
harassment 
against 

Philbert arose in the Public Health 
School. One of Philbert’s research 
assistants reported Philbert had 
“asked her for sex, to marry him, 
to run away together and to ‘have 
caramel colored babies’ with him.” 
The alerted Public Health professor 
relayed the information to multiple 
University 
officials, 
including 

the then-Public Health dean Ken 
Warner; Lori Pierce, vice provost 
academic and faculty affairs and 
Anthony Walesby, director of the 

Office of Institutional Equity. 

As the director of OIE, Walesby 

was responsible for investigating 
sexual 
harassment 
complaints 

against faculty. According to the 
report, when he tried to speak 
with the women, however, both 
declined for fear of retaliation from 
Philbert. Another member of the 
Philbert’s lab — a graduate student 
— reported Philbert had a “bad 
reputation with women” and that 
he asked another student for sex. 
Walesby determined OIE could not 
investigate further since women 
would not speak with him, the 
report says. 

In 2010, Philbert was in the 

running to become the Dean of 
the Public Health School. During 
the process, Paula Lantz, the chair 
of the Search Committee, became 
aware of the 2005 allegations and 
informed the Provost’s Office of 
the allegations. After meeting 
with 
Warner, 
Lantz 
did 
not 

inform the committee because 
“the investigation revealed no 
wrongdoing.” At the same time, 
then-Provost Philip Hanlon also 
learned of the 2005 allegations and 

had more information than Lantz, 
after meeting with multiple people 
to further question. 

Both Lantz and Hanlon, along 

with the Search Committee were 
aware of a confidential survey 
in which a participant said “I 
was subject to inappropriate and 
unwanted sexual comments and 
suggestions,” according to the 
report. The report concludes that 
both Lantz and Hanlon should have 
turned the survey results to the OIE 
for further investigation.

In 2017, Pierce was a member 

of the Provost Search Committee, 
which was chaired by University 
President Mark Schlissel. The 
report finds that the committee 
and Schlissel did not learn any 
information about Philbert’s alleged 
mistreatment of women during the 
search process, even though Pierce 
was one of the University officials 
Walseby reported the 2013 incident 
to.

Pools of carmel swirling around a black hole abyss 

My eyes call themselves beautiful.

Candied flakes swallowing influxes of light, 

I love this skeleton,

Composed of bones proven durable 

From years of resisting wordly tarnish 

I love this skeleton, 

Despite the unevenness of my ribs

The lopsided steel bars that 

Protect my fragile beating core 

I love my shoulders,

Likened to soils drenched

And weighed down heavy 

in the exhausted screams,

of my mother 

of her mother

and hers 

They are distinctly proud and poised 

I love how I am bound 

I’ve stretched my muscles like rubber,

Then alchemized them strong 

Chainlinking flesh to bone

Flesh I now love enough to not dig into,

The places where crimson once percolated

between slivers of once fragile skin 

Now fastened shut, scars nearly indistinguishable

I love the places where mountains have formed proudly 

I adorn them in loose silks and velvets

I’ve been told of the beauty of my deepest trenches

I’ve come to love being the tree that grows the flower

I’ve come to fall in love with melting into my souls warm embrace

the reality of dismantling the police

O

n Sunday, June 7, nine members of the Minneapolis City Council acknowledged that the current system of policing is not working 
and that they intend to “defund and dismantle” the city police department. Council President Lisa Bender stated, “(We need) to 
listen, especially to our Black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions 

lie in our community.” While still in the process of planning exactly what these new, transformative and community-based initiatives 
may look like, the goal is to implement a model of public safety that actually keeps each community safe. Conversations of defunding 
and dismantling police departments have popped up all over the country, and many are concerned about what exactly this means.

‘Adorn’

My mother is a 5 foot 2 inch 

Indian woman and I’m her only 
child. 
This 
statement 
alone 

should speak volumes about our 
relationship. To compensate for 
my lack of siblings, at times she 
acts like my older sister. At times 
when I’m overwhelmed with life 
and a bit lost (as one is inevitably 
bound to be in their early 20’s), 
she acts as my guide and great-
est comfort. Somehow, she’s also 
managed to find the right bal-
ance of being my best friend and 
my greatest annoyance and even 
a few times what seems to be 
my arch nemesis. How a single 
person can encapsulate so many 
different roles and keep them all 
at various steady states is simply 
beyond me. It also shows that 
parenting is very much an art and 
a full time job. 

As a woman and an immigrant, 

society has not given my mother 
any favors. Like the majority of 
the incredibly strong women in 
my family, she’s had to kick some 
serious ass and is one of the hard-
est working people I know (trust 
me, raising me was no vacation). 
My mother had undoubtedly 
learned these qualities at an early 
age but they were definitely put 
to the test as she set out to fulfill 
the “American Dream” (what-
ever that may mean now) with 
my father. In her 5 foot 2 inch 
frame, my mother carries herself 
like Shaquille O’Neal. Her shoe 
size may be 5.5 but she leaves 
footprints that could be mistaken 
for those of an NBA All-star. She 
has a warmth and confidence 
about her that is bound to bring 
a smile to the face of anyone who 
interacts with her. But as her kid, 
she was also the judge and jury 
in my household with her blue 
Chevy Malibu being her court-
room. For anyone that doesn’t 
know, the Chevy Malibu is a car 
that screams “I’m a parent but 
I’m too cool for a minivan”. Car 
rides with my mom were often 
the time she’d take out of her day 
to painfully analyze the variety 
of stupid decisions I used to and 
still make. I knew upon entry 
through the passenger door that 
if my mother was speaking in 
English or Hindi then our inter-
action would be rather civil. But 
if at any point my mother started 
to speak in Punjabi, I knew I was 
in for a full fledged bar fight. 

But standing at a mighty 5 foot 

2 inches didn’t particularly help 
my mom in her role as the disci-
plinarian. Imagine a courtroom 
for an example. You’ve got your 
plaintiff’s table, your defendants 
table and your jury box that are 
roughly at the same height. But 
the judge’s bench in comparison 
is significantly higher. The judge 
literally looks down on everyone 
and makes a decision. This was 
very much our relationship till 
the age of around 12-13. My moth-
er would tower over my skinny 
four foot something self, make 
the meanest face she could make 
and bring me to swift justice — no 
trial or deliberation needed. Con-
sidering this, puberty pushing me 
over the height of 5’ 2’’ may have 
been one of the highlights of my 
early adolescent life. It’s as if the 
defendant now has a bench that’s 
taller than the judges - compro-
mising the height difference that 
is integral to our justice system! 
And like any comic book villain 
with an epic origin story— at 5’ 
3’’, my newfound sense of tallness 
gave me license to wreak havoc in 
middle school. This set off a long-
standing back and forth between 
my mother and I of me making 
very stupid decisions and my 
mother somehow always being 
one step ahead of me and catch-
ing me within the act.

Fast forward a whole decade 

to now, if you’re taking classes 
from home and living with your 
parents and particularly if you’re 
a freshman — reading this may 
not make you feel any better 
about your current living situa-
tion. But take it from a seasoned 
vet who’s commuted to campus 
for the last three years now — it’s 
not as bad as everyone thinks it 
is. Yes, I understand that living 
with your parents as a 21 year 
old isn’t a particularly attractive 
quality but hear me out. I’ve had 
the luxury of going to college in 
my hometown. I’m on campus 
for the majority of the day and to 
get home I take a Bursley - Baits 
and walk 10 minutes. Therefore, 
as a sophomore when I told my 
very Indian father about my idea 
of living with my friends in a 
house on campus I was met with 
a confused reaction. I was sternly 
reminded of how he immigrated 
to the United States not even 
dreaming that he’d end up own-
ing a house in Ann Arbor and 
now I was asking him to pay for 
a second place in the same city? 
It was one of the rare times you 
see a person’s blood pressure rise 
visibly. 

At the time I had my concerns. 

I mean I had lived in the dorms 
during my freshman year and 
was afraid of missing out on an 
essential 
college 
experience. 

Sure living away from home 
meant that I went from finding 
texts from my mother “annoy-
ing” to actively trying to call her 
when I could. But moving back in 
with them? I had done four years 
of high school and who wants to 
do that again? Whenever an adult 
tells me that they wish they could 
go back to high school, I prompt-
ly remind them that it didn’t get 
any better. But what I overlooked 
is the ability for relationships to 
change. If there’s anything that 
the 300 page Khan academy 
MCAT 
psychology/sociology 

review document taught me, it’s 
that the cerebrum — the part of 
your brain that is responsible for 
actions such as critical think-
ing and decision making — is 
far from fully developed during 
adolescence. Therefore, as a high 
schooler dealing with classes, 
hormones and trying to do every 
extracurricular out there to make 
your college resume special, 
some things are bound to just 
not stick. For me this was often 
the many conversations that my 
mother and I would have in her 
Chevy Malibu. Sure, some of 
those were about academics, but 
most of them were about growing 
as a person. 

I can guarantee that your 

relationship with your parents 
will not be the same as it was 
under the angsty pretenses of 
high school. Mine certainly isn’t 
the “catch me if you can” type of 
game that my mother and I have 
been playing from the ages of 13 
through 18. In fact, many of those 
conversations from my mother’s 
Malibu have really started to res-
onate with me and have become 
an important part of my identity 
as I’ve gone through college. I’ve 
been truly blessed to have the 
best of both worlds of being from 
the town that I go to college in. 
I’ve been able to have my free-
dom and grow as an individual by 
being on campus while also keep-
ing myself grounded with where 
I’m from. Continuously learning 
invaluable lessons from my par-
ents about growing up and being 
an adult (responsible or not — the 
jury’s still out on that one). Take 
it from your now very boomer 
sounding friend, give your par-
ents a chance. I promise they’re 
not as hopeless as you think they 
are. 

Now more than ever before, 

I have found myself with a fuse 
shorter than imaginable. I am a 
ticking time bomb, eager to be 
set off preemptively. Harmless 
slights from my siblings lead to 
prolonged campaigns of verbal 
exodus consisting of every insult 
in the book and insignificant dis-
agreements with my parents are 
the catalyst to what seems to be 
the next world war. It’s a marvel 
no one in my family has had some 
type of mental breakdown result-
ing from the compounding stress 
and anxiety being generated 
like electricity from a turbine of 
anguish.

I have been on the brink of los-

ing it quite a few times since this 
all began. I get into these moods. 
It happens intermittently, maybe 
about once every 2 - 3 weeks. And 
similar to the tide, the intensity 
of the wave that carries my emo-
tions oscillates violently. These 
moods translate into episodes in 
which I just shout about all of the 
little things that have been eating 
away at me. 

As these moods swallow me 

up, I feel as if I’ve been thrown 
into the ocean accompanied by 
a sack of bricks to help weigh me 
down. My natural buoyancy isn’t 
enough to keep me afloat, and so 
I’m pulled deeper. Without any 
semblance of what’s pulling me 
down further, I become disori-
ented. As what feels like dark, 
cold saltwater fills my lungs I 
scream out. I try to remain con-
scious in an attempt to construe 
why I’m drowning, why it is that 
I am so distraught.

Even as I eventually breach 

the surface, as suddenly as I was 
pulled to the depths, I struggle 
to understand what sequence of 
events, emotions, ebbs were to 

blame for my episode.

As I said, I haven’t been able to 

figure out what it is that drives 
me into the aforementioned 
moods. I’m not familiar with 
some dogmatic approach like the 
scientific method to better grasp 
the probably neurological devic-
es facilitating my episodes. 

One 
virtue, 
however, 
has 

served as a floatation device. 
This virtue, patience, has kept 
me afloat at times when I was 
bound to have another episode. 
It should be made clear though, 
I am not describing inherent 
patience. The patience I speak of 
is learned, conscious and seem-
ingly tangible. It’s easily attain-
able, though upkeep requires 
effort. 

It can be difficult, remaining 

stuck in our homes, virtually 
experiencing the same thing day 
in and day out. We begin per-
forming familiar tasks, latching 
on to whatever brings us closest 
to that sense of normalcy, of a 
routine. These de facto routines 
that keep us from what seems 
like dying of boredom become 
monotonous and to an extent 
create faulty faculties of comfort. 
Once we’re accustomed to these 
routines, even the slightest devi-
ations caused by external fac-
tors (i.e. a younger sibling rudely 
disrupting your mid-afternoon 
nap) can feel catastrophic. We’re 
snapped back into our current 
(and 
indefinite) 
reality, 
los-

ing grip on those routines that 
ensured we kept pace.

That’s where patience steps 

in. It acts as that intermediary, a 
breath before the yelling ensues 
and insults are hurled. It reels 
us in, offering a moment of clar-
ity to decide whether the battle is 
worth fighting, if there really is a 
battle that needs to be fought at 
all.

That insight, that awareness 

that creates those brief pauses 

for patience to intervene are 
only half of it. We may learn that 
skill, but we still have a conscious 
decision to make. It requires 
willpower to deliberately take 
what’s commonly known as “the 
high ground.” I’d prefer to refer 
to it as a willful election of an 
alternative to conflict. I don’t 
think there is anything immoral 
about expressing human emotion 
(even if it may come in the form 
of shouting), so to call it “the high 
ground” would be an admonish-
ment of those who choose to 
share their feelings in a more 
passionate manner. By resorting 
to that willful election we reaf-
firm that ability to defuse con-
flict and dissipate tension. 

It would be quite ignorant, 

foolish even, of me to place the 
responsibility of being patient on 
a single individual in an entire 
household. It goes in either 
direction, and just as we must 
practice patience we should be 
able to expect it in return. How-
ever, to think that the principal 
incentive of practicing patience 
is for oneself contradicts the act 
of willfully electing something 
other than conflict; as conflict 
requires more than one. This 
means that our attempt isn’t to 
become more virtuous or pious 
than those around us, but instead 
to guide those we reside with 
in being more thoughtful when 
interacting with one another — 
even if that requires taking the 
first step. That first step is prac-
ticing patience with others even 
if it isn’t reciprocated.

Patience is a virtuous cycle that 

pays dividends in an invaluable, 
intangible currency. A currency 
that cannot be spent, yet is typi-
cally worth more than the value 
we assign it. It is best we hold on 
to it though, so as we continue 
on in these times we have some-
thing to keep us sane when facing 
total and utter uncertainty.

What I Learned in Quarantine: Patience

As the summer comes to a 

close, and our time as Manag-
ing Editors is now complete, 
we would like to close off with 
a letter and a hope for MiC — 
an ode to a summer of revolu-
tion, if you will. Neither of us 
could have predicted what we 
signed up for, but we are more 
than proud of what we were 
able to accomplish. Thanks to 
a group of brilliant and talent-
ed writers and staff, we were 
able to pull off a summer of 
enlightening and educational 
series of writing which not 
only shared personal expe-
riences or reflections, but 
provided scholastic and expe-
riential insight into the many 
departments and institutions 
that feed the Black and Indig-
enous plight in America — a 
truth that is often rejected 
and whose existence is per-
petuated through journalism. 
Not only did we learn so much 
from our peers, but we are so 
grateful to have been given 
this opportunity to amplify 
issues in our country which 
have been occurring since 
the genesis of our nation, and 
which built the nation. These 
issues will persist until we 
confront them in every system 
through which we function — 
social, governmental, econom-
ic, etc. — we hold our peers 
accountable 
for 
this 
same 

confrontation, actively edu-
cate ourselves on how these 
systems affect society at micro 
and macro levels and utilize 
that education to grow and 
change with an united front. 

Michigan in Color started 

out as a safe community exclu-
sively for BIPOC to write and 
share their experiences at the 
University of Michigan and in 
the broad United States. We 
tried our best this summer to 
uphold MiC traditions while 
also adjusting to inevitable 
change and pursuing neces-
sary actions as a section to 
carry on the change we insti-
gated this summer. Before 
we give up our positions, we 
would like to remind others, 

especially at The Michigan 
Daily, that the sentiment of 
change which began this sum-
mer can not and should not 
stop here. The newspaper’s 
responsibility does not only 
rest in its published content, 
but in the team that they hire 
to write, edit and administrate 
that content for the paper. In 
all of our efforts to expand 
content and staff, we must be 
adamant about centering the 
Black and Indigenous voice — 
especially those of womxn. As 
the MiC section, we also want 
to hold each section account-
able for this responsibility as 
individual groups — it is not 
enough to have Michigan in 
Color at the paper; this work 
must be demonstrated by each 
and every section at the paper. 
Simply put, MiC cannot and 
will not be your excuse or your 
teacher. We must treat MiC as 
an individual section which 
operates on our own basis. We 
are not diversity issue scape-
goats and we must operate as 
a whole group to rectify our 
wrongdoings for a greater 
future. 

But this conversation and 

demand 
for 
accountability 

is far greater than the paper 
— we would like to inspire a 
bigger call to action for our 
readers, as this time is one to 
take advantage of. We have 
sat comfortably for too long 
in great periods of performa-
tive activism. As we continue 
to stand complacent in the 
visual apologies granted to 
us by large corporations and 
brand names who participate 
in oppressive systems, we our-
selves perpetuate them and we 
ultimately oppress one anoth-
er. Amidst this pandemic and 
simultaneous civil rights and 
liberation movements sprout-
ing globally, we have been 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 

demand more from ourselves, 
from one another and from 
those who puppeteer these 
systems. We encourage you to 
be intentional and reflective 
with each pursuit of activism 
you engage in: Is this truly the 
most beneficial way for you to 
wield your privilege and/or 
space for the liberation move-
ment at hand? Do you know 

who and what you are fighting 
for? Do you know what you are 
willing to sacrifice? Will you 
sacrifice it? Ask yourself these 
questions. 

As for me, Cheryn, I also 

wanted to give a big thank 
you to my co-managing editor 
Gabrijela. Without her, I do 
not know if I could have been 
able to do anything this sum-
mer. As a woman who identi-
fies as Korean-American, I 
can’t and will never under-
stand the Black struggle in 
America and wanted to make 
sure this summer I was able 
to work for and with Black 
Americans without silencing 
their voice, and Gabrijela has 
taught me so much regard-
ing how to be a proper ally. I 
simply thought going into the 
summer this would be a job, 
but it was much more than 
that, and I know Gabrijela and 
I will always be a team and 
friendship, whether we are 
MiC ME’s or not.

As for me, Gabrijela, I want 

to first thank Cheryn, my co-
managing editor. With her, 
I was given the space and 
platform to create something 
greater than me and my own 
mind. My dear co-ME works 
like a racehorse, because that 
is simply who she is. And for all 
of your intellect, compassion 
and truth, I thank you. I want 
to thank our writers who were 
committed to their stories and 
to our community, and who I 
ultimately could not do my job 
without. I want to thank you 
readers, even if there are only 
two of you, and tell you that I 
have extreme hope for you and 
for our society’s future. But 
this hope is dependent on what 
we as civilians are inspired to 
manifest. If you want mental 
and economic revolution — as 
I so desperately do — then you 
will see it come to fruition. 

A big thank you to the Opin-

ion EPE, Brittany Bowman, 
for putting her heart and foot 
into her contributions to MiC’s 
educational mission this sum-
mer; as well as our EIC, Emma 
Stein, and ME, Devak Nanua, 
for helping us create and final-
ize our vision.

Heard the ruckus for the new 

Netflix reality TV show “Indian 
Matchmaking,” but not sure if 
you want to watch it? Don’t fret 
the details, I won’t spoil any-
thing, but I’ll help you navigate 
whether or not this is a show for 
you. 

If you come from a Desi fam-

ily like me, you grew up hearing 
about how the numerous rela-
tionships in your family were 
based upon an arranged mar-
riage. While it is not as com-
monly practiced today, arranged 
marriages are super common 
within Southeast Asian house-

holds, as well as most Central 
Asian countries and the Middle 
East. That’s why when I saw the 
commotion around Netflix hav-
ing a show focused on the South 
Asian community, I couldn’t wait 
to see this rishta aunty work her 
magic in what I understood as a 
nuanced modern take. While the 
show is based between both India 
and the United States, the rela-
tionships are inherently driven 
by regressive ideals of colorism, 
classism and gender stereotypes. 

Sima Aunty, the rishta queen 

of Mumbai, pulls biodata to 
form the most compatible pairs, 
in which contains information 
about the single men and women 
seeking to get paired based on 

age, height, education, career and 
more. Needless to say, the show is 
extremely toxic but insightful on 
a harsh reality for many within 
Desi culture. 

A fun game Sima Aunty sub-

consciously plays is find-the-
backhanded-compliment. If the 
man or woman does not fit the 
idealistic norm of being rich, fair, 
petite or beautiful enough, don’t 
worry! This rishta aunty might 
say their personality makes up 
for what’s lacking. And if the lad 
or laddie has the “better rated” 
for looks, education and stabil-
ity, they’ll get the upper hand in 
Sima Aunty finding them more 
suitable matches. If you’re the 
bottom end of the pair — and to 

make her job easier — she’ll rec-
ommend how you’ll have to com-
promise on personal desires in a 
future spouse in order to make 
the marriage work. 

Depending on the focus, be it 

the man or woman, the narra-
tive changes but the superficial-
ity is maintained. For all the girl 
bosses — independent and run-
ning their lives — Aunty suggests 
it will be harder to match them 
because they have a mind of their 
own and the financial mobility 
to do so, inconveniencing Sima’s 
search. Similarly, if a client was 
previously divorced or is not the 
ideal body weight, you’ve gotta 
give Sima more time because 
you’re burdening her with under-

sible characteristics. 

Meanwhile, the men on the 

show are in an entirely other 
ballgame. While you get the 
occasional sweet laddu padhus 
who will charm the audience 
with their wholesome charisma, 
Sima prefers they have stable 
careers and six-figure jobs. The 
best part about being a male on 
her show is the richer you are 
the more choices you get. These 
men get hundreds of biodatas to 
choose from because objectify-
ing women is so much fun! And 
who’s to blame them? They, or 
rather the parents, have to make 
sure their son’s wife is beauti-
ful and fair enough for their off-
spring because we all know it’s 

the male that carries the brain in 
the household — so that is already 
guaranteed. 

Overall, if you’re looking for 

a show to make you feel better 
about yourself, this is the show 
for you! Let this show bring out 
your own insecurities. The best 
part is if you have immigrant 
families 
from 
similar 
back-

grounds, they can reminisce, 
reliving extreme trauma from 
their own past, but this time with 
the whole family! As a female 
South-Asian American, I feel like 
this show is a mockery of cultural 
Desi traditions and households, 
only to be the laughing stock of 
the Western world. But hey, by all 
means Netflix—at least it sells!

A satiric review of Netflix’s ‘Indian Matchmaking’

Disclaimer: *names have been 

abbreviated in order to ensure the 
privacy of the identities involved

In October 2019, the people of 

Lebanon began to fill the streets 
chanting “kellon yaani kellon,” 
which translates to “all of them 
means all of them.” All of them, 
referring to the corrupt sectarian 
government officials who have pri-
oritized their own greed over pro-
viding the Lebanese people with 
fundamental aid and services for 
years, leaving Lebanon to be the 
third most indebted country in the 
world. Lebanon has a debt to GDP 
ratio of 152 percent, and has over 
75 percent of its population living 
below the poverty line. The country 
is without a stable economy, stable 

electricity, waste management ser-
vices and food security for no rea-
son other than the government’s 
inherent greed. When the Lebanese 
people chant, “kellon yaani kellon,” 
it is intended to leave no question 
that all politicians, whether the 
president or a cabinet member, are 
the problem. As long as the current 
ideologies 
perpetuated 
through 

political power persist, Lebanon 
will be stuck in an eternal cycle of 
corruption. 

Years of a broken economic sys-

tem, characterized by corruption 
and heavy reliance on imports, the 
pegging of the Lebanese currency to 
the US dollar and a diaspora which 
endlessly pumps cash into a fragile 
banking system, has inevitably led 
to the toppling of Lebanon’s econo-
my. In recent months, the Lebanese 
currency has crashed and prices 
have skyrocketed, creating a disap-

pearing middle class and further 
distress on the poor. Over 49 per-
cent of Lebanon’s population (6.8 
million) are food insecure, and with 
the price of grocery staples dou-
bling, or even tripling, low income 
people are destitute. Some parents 
have to decide if they are going to 
buy formula or diapers — as there is 
no way for them to afford both. 

HK*, who has lived in Lebanon 

throughout her whole life, includ-
ing the civil war, told The Daily the 

economic collapse has left Lebanon 
in the worst state she has ever seen. 

“During the civil war, we were 

mostly scared of bombings,” HK 
said. “We had hope that the war 
would end. Now, we are scared of 
tomorrow and we cannot see hope.” 

Lack of hope, a shared sentiment 

among the Lebanese, is reasonable, 
given the little to no aid the govern-
ment is providing for the people. 
The government has failed to reim-
burse hospitals, making it impos-

sible to pay staff and buy medical 
supplies, exacerbating the effects of 
COVID-19. 

“COVID-19 is a problem, like it 

is everywhere in the world, but it 
is not our main problem,” HK said. 
“The economy is our biggest prob-
lem.” 

Videos have surfaced of pregnant 

women eating from dumpsters and 
mothers on the streets offering to 
sell their organs to feed their chil-
dren. Among those belonging to 
the most vulnerable communities 
are Syrian refugees— 30 percent of 
Lebanon’s population. Over 87 per-
cent of the refugees lack food, 73 
percent lack a permanent home and 
each one of them are at devastating 
odds against Lebanon’s economic 
crisis and COVID-19. 

“With all the suffering going 

on, the government is not doing 
anything,” HK said. “We need a 
government that cares about their 
people — both the poor and the rich 
people.”

Although the economic crisis 

hits the poor the hardest, those with 
economic stability are still affected. 
Banks are limiting withdrawals and 
those who have bank accounts in 
dollars are getting paid in liras — 
which are worth nothing. 

“I went to the supermarket and 

spent around half a million liras. 
That bought me hardly anything, 
basically nothing,” HK said. 

Like most of Lebanon’s public 

services, electricity is poorly provid-
ed through a government-owned 
company. Electricite du Liban, the 
state power company, cannot afford 
to purchase enough fuel to provide 
twenty-four-hour electricity for 
the Lebanese people but can easily 
afford to put millions of dollars into 
the pockets of government leaders 
and their colleagues. When the pro-
testors say kellon yaani kellon, they 
are talking about the government 
leaders who fail to keep the lights 
on, the garbage off the streets and 
the Lebanese children fed and in 
school. Kellon yaani kellon until the 
lights are always on.

I 

have 
real 
problems 

with my city and my 
university. It’s legal in 

Ann Arbor to gather outside 
in groups of 25 and inside in 
groups of 10. But it isn’t safe. 
The city also requires that we 
wear masks when in groups, 
but 
even 
that’s 
not 
safe 

unless we are six feet apart. 
And how easy is it to wear a 
mask when you’re having a 
drink and a conversation? 

My 
city 
— 
the 
city 
I 

came 
home 
to 
10 
years 

after I graduated from the 
University of Michigan — 
is not doing all it should to 
protect students. 

And 
our 
university? 

Well, I hate to admit it, but 
Michigan State University is 
behaving more responsibly 
on this one. They’ve opted to 
have all classes online, while 
our university is offering 
some in-person classes and 
students are flooding the 
campus. 

Full 
disclosure: 
I’m 
a 

senior citizen, which means 
this virus is more likely 
to kill me than it is to kill 
students. I live near campus 
with my husband and one of 
my sons. I have always loved 
living among students — it 
energizes me. Now, not so 
much. 

I grew up in New York and 

came to Michigan to go to the 
University. After graduating, 
I returned to the big city to 

do a doctorate at New York 
University. By the time I 
was finished, I was married 
to a Michigan guy, and we 
both missed Ann Arbor. We 
packed up and came home to 

our college town, and we’ve 
never regretted it. 

I love this city and this 

university, but I worry about 
the path we’re all on. Very 
few people get through this 
disease 
without 
suffering. 

If you’ve ever had the flu, 
imagine 
something 
much 

worse. And then there’s the 
possibility of dying, even for 
young people. 

Even 
though 
the 
virus 

may be more dangerous for 
old folks like me, it can do 
irreparable damage to you, 
sometimes in ways that can’t 
hurt me any more — the loss 
of fertility may be one of the 
long-term effects of suffering 
from this virus. Too little is 
known to be sure of that, but 
some of the consequences are 
so unknown they aren’t even 
being investigated yet.

So 
I’m 
asking 
you 
to 

consider 
being 
more 

responsible than the people 
making 
the 
rules 
around 

here. Wear masks whenever 
you’re out. Stand six feet away 
from others. Skip parties 
until there’s a vaccine. If you 
can opt to take your classes 
online, do that. 

This is a bummer. For all 

of us, but especially for you. I 
have wonderful memories of 
my college years, and social 
life was a major part of the 
college experience. I didn’t 
have 
to 
choose 
between 

connecting with friends and 
staying alive and healthy, and 
you shouldn’t have to either. 
But you do. And the choice 
should 
be 
easy 
enough, 

however painful. 

Stay safe. Stay well. And 

we’ll all meet again on the 
other side of this. 

B

eginning college is an 
exciting and stressful 
time for most students. 

The anticipation of a new 
town, new campus and new 
friends brings all kinds of 
feelings, a majority of which 
are happy ones. All too often 
this excitement is tainted by 
warnings of weight gain in 
the form of the “Freshman 
15.” Well-meaning older peers 
and family members warn 
you to “watch what you eat in 
the dining halls,” or outright 
suggest that you “don’t eat ‘x’ 
because you’ll gain weight,” 
as 
if 
such 
a 
biologically 

natural and necessary lifelong 
process is the worst thing 
that can happen to you. Well, 
I have news for you. Weight 
gain as a college student is 
natural, most times harmless 
and honestly, it should be the 
least of your concerns. The 
notion that weight gain stops 
at the age of 18 and that your 
teenaged high-school body 
is to be maintained for life 
needs to go.

Let’s breakdown the fear 

and anxiety that comes along 
with the dreaded “Freshman 
15” for what it really is — 
negative and anxious feelings 
toward weight gain as a result 
of a fatphobic society that has 
ingrained a mantra of “thin 
equals healthy and attractive” 
while 
being 
in 
a 
larger 

body is seen as unhealthy, 
undesirable 
and 
carries 

underlying 
assumptions 

about the person, namely that 
they are lazy. Yet, the fears 
surrounding this old myth are 
uncalled for.

Not only is the saying 

an exaggeration, with the 
average weight gain being 
2.5-3.5 pounds during the 
first year of college, it is also 
inaccurate to assume weight 
gain 
automatically 
equals 

unhealthy, 
overweight 
or 

“fat.” Even if one wanted to go 
by the BMI standard — which 
is misleading for its own 
reasons — a 2.5-pound weight 
gain, 
in 
the 
approximate 

average range, barely nudges 
one’s BMI. So, if you’re in the 
“healthy” category, odds are 
you’re going to remain right 
there. Even if one were to gain 
the “15 pounds” as the saying 
goes, it’s also entirely possible 
and common to remain within 
the “healthy” category. For 
example, a 19-year-old female 
with a BMI of 21 can gain 
15 pounds and end up at a 
BMI of 23.5 which is still a 
“healthy” BMI, dependent on 
the height. However, I’d like 
to go beyond BMI since, as I 
said before, there are many 
reasons as to why it’s not an 
accurate measure of health. 

For one, the categories of 

“overweight” 
and 
“obese” 

are so ambiguous and lacking 
in evidence. In fact, in 1998, 
the categories changed, and 
as a result, millions became 
“overweight” 
or 
“obese” 

overnight 
— 
something 

the diet industry has made 
billions off of. Some may be 
shocked to learn that more 
studies 
are 
showing 
that 

being “overweight” can be 
perfectly healthy. A meta-
analysis of a bunch of studies 
found that individuals who 

are 
underweight 
have 
a 

greater risk of death than 
individuals falling under the 
“obese” category. 

Yet, 
no 
one 
criticizes 

very thin-bodied people the 
same way they do larger-
bodied folks. It’s actually 
the opposite — an immense 
glorification of very thin-
bodied people that more often 
than not is praise toward an 
eating disorder or disordered 
eating behaviors. So, this 
supposedly 
“well-intended” 

advice given to young adults 
under the guise of “health” 
does 
nothing 
to 
support 

health since health is not a 
number. 

The Health at Every Size 

(HAES) 
movement, 
which 

encompasses the principles of 
Intuitive Eating, is growing 
and so is the research backing 
it. 
If 
anything, 
warnings 

against 
the 
“Freshman 

15” are way more hurtful 
than helpful and send diet 
culture messages that weight 
gain is inherently bad and 
unattractive — that we should 
actively be trying to suppress 
our body weight or pursue 
weight loss. No wonder eating 
disorders 
and 
disordered 

eating behaviors are rampant 
on campuses. 

What’s 
most 
frustrating 

about 
the 
“Freshman 
15” 

message is the assumption 
that the weight you are at on 
the day of your high school 
graduation is somehow the 
weight you must be at during 
college, 
and 
pretty 
much 

the rest of your life. This is 
absolutely 
absurd. 
Young 

adults are actively growing 
and 
developing 
well 
into 

their mid-20s, so ill-advised 
measures projected on them 
to suppress their body weight 
do much more harm and zero 
good.

Furthermore, 
more 

research in support of set 
point 
theory 
has 
come 

forward, 
supporting 
the 

theory’s belief that every 
individual 
has 
a 
pre-

disposed set weight range in 
which their body functions 
optimally, and the body will 
actively fight to maintain 
this range. This is not to say 
that everyone’s setpoints will 
abide by the BMI standards. 
It would be foolish to think 
that every unique individual 
should 
be 
in 
a 
certain 

BMI range because that’s 
what’s healthiest for them. 
Who are we, as a society, 

to 
determine 
that? 
Some 

people’s 
setpoint 
ranges 

are 
within 
the 
“healthy” 

category, and plenty of others 
are within the “underweight” 
or “overweight” categories. 
In terms of those in the 
“underweight” 
group 

specifically, the difference 
here 
is 
that 
one 
whose 

natural set weight range is 
in this category maintains 
their weight without effort, 
meaning 
without 
dietary 

restriction and/or the abuse of 
exercise to keep that weight. 
Even if they purposefully 
pushed themselves to overeat 
for a period of time, it would 
be just as unsustainable as is 
undereating for a period of 
time (cough, cough, diet).

So, what to do? Surely, 

there must be some nutrition 
advice people must abide by, 
and surely, we must exercise. 
Well, yes and no. The forceful 
mindset of this statement is all 
wrong. What almost everyone 
gets wrong about the HAES 
movement is that it promotes 
obesity, and not only permits 
but encourages people to eat 
“junk” foods 24/7 and never 
exercise again. That couldn’t 
be farther from the truth. 
The 
movement 
champions 

the idea that one can pursue 
health 
at 
any 
weight 
by 

listening to their body and 
eating intuitively. Our bodies 
crave balance by nature, so 
while some may find they 
crave the calorically dense 
foods 
deemed 
“unhealthy” 

by society on some days, 
accepting that craving and 
meeting it is the best thing 
to 
do, 
and 
often 
results 

in the body craving more 
traditionally nutritious foods 
at other times. Full body trust 
is crucial. 

HAES 
also 
encourages 

people to partake in physical 
movement that they enjoy 
and that feels good. By taking 
a step away from mainstream 
fitness (and diet) culture, 
which 
pushes 
“working 

out” on people as something 
they have to do on the daily, 
movement 
becomes 
more 

appealing and enjoyable. It’s 
no longer confined to a gym or 
high-pressure 
environment. 

Instead, it includes walks or 
hikes with friends or playing 
tennis with a partner. All 
in all, if health is one’s true 
concern, then focusing on a 
number on a scale is a micro 
piece of the puzzle and largely 
irrelevant. Most times, it leads 
to poorer health as a result 
of 
unsustainable 
dieting 

measures. The best thing to 
target is behaviors, and that’s 
exactly what HAES supports 
by encouraging people to tune 
into their individual body’s 
needs and explore movement, 
with the goal to adopt healthy 
movement as an enjoyable, 
recurring practice. 

The healthiest thing for 

us college students, then, 
is to skip over the years of 
pointless 
and 
unhealthy 

dieting entirely and start 
practicing the principles of 
HAES and Intuitive Eating 
now.

W

ith 
the 
end 
of 

summer 
drawing 

near, 
many 

students, faculty and staff 
fearfully 
anticipate 
the 

repercussions of University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

vague and impractical plan 
for a public health-informed 
fall semester. Beside basic 
measures such as increasing 
social 
distancing 
in 

classrooms, 
requiring 
face 

masks on all campus grounds 
and offering a great number of 
online courses, few concrete 
steps have been taken to 
repress a COVID-19 outbreak 
on any of the three University 
of 
Michigan 
campuses. 

Schlissel himself stated that 
much of the reopening plan 
is 
dependent 
on 
students 

following 
public 
health 

guidelines, which — as we’ve 
seen as students begin to 
move back to Ann Arbor — is 
unlikely to happen. Despite the 
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill moving classes 
online after one week and 
Central Michigan University 
increasing their case numbers 
tenfold within the first week 
of classes, both due to student 
behavior, Schlissel somehow 
still 
believes 
that 
our 

campuses will have a different 
result. 

It 
could 
be 
considered 

flattering that Schlissel is 
outwardly shows such strong 
faith in the student body. 
However, this outlook assumes 
that 
the 
immunologist 

running one of the world’s 
best public universities is 
naive and ignorant enough 
to 
believe 
his 
students, 

who 
have 
been 
partying 

throughout the summer, are 
suddenly going to stop. In his 
most recent announcement to 
the University of Michigan 
community, he implied that 
students who don’t follow 
public health guidelines will 
be to blame if the University 
is forced to revert to online-
only 
classes. 
Placing 
the 

responsibility on the students to 
follow public health guidelines 
upon 
returning 
to 
campus 

is an attempt to scapegoat 
the student body so that the 
administration cannot be held 
accountable 
for 
triggering 

the inevitable viral outbreak. 
While any student who hosts 
or attends a party with more 
than 25 people is culpable for 
whatever consequences that 
gathering has on their campus 
or surrounding communities, 
the University administration 
is still at fault for enabling 
them.

If 
the 
University 
had 

any true intent to keep our 
campuses open throughout 
the upcoming school year, 
there would be explicitly 
stated and properly severe 
consequences 
for 
any 

student found to be violating 
public 
health 
guidelines. 

There would be a plan for 
rigorous 
asymptomatic 

testing of the entire campus 
throughout 
the 
semester. 

Every single course would 
have the option to be taken 
online. All students living in 
dorms would live in single 
rooms and be provided with 
adequate personal protective 
equipment. Bathrooms would 
have 
plexiglass 
between 

sinks. Any and all testing 
and 
COVID-19 
related 

treatment for students, staff 
and faculty living on any 
of the three U-M campuses 
would be paid for by the 
University. These demands 
are included in a petition 
created by #NotMICampus, 

a 
coalition 
of 
students 

from 
various 
universities 

in the state of Michigan 
demanding 
changes 
in 

problematic reopening plans 
arising from their schools. 
The petition can be found 
here, and I strongly urge 
anybody 
concerned 
about 

the 
University’s 
current 

reopening plan to sign it. 

Still, if the administration 

truly cared about the well-
being of its students, staff 
and faculty as well as the 
communities that host our 
campuses, 
classes 
would 

have already been moved 
online 
for 
the 
upcoming 

semesters. 
In 
fact, 
there 

would not have been a plan 
for in-person classes in the 
first place. The university 
with a leading School of 
Public Health would have 
lived up to its “Leaders and 

the Best” slogan by leading 
the transition into an entirely 
online education throughout 
the rest of this pandemic. 
There would not have been a 
1.9 percent tuition increase 
but rather a reduction in 
tuition for all three campuses 
to compensate for the lack of 
university 
facilities 
being 

used throughout the school 
year. 
The 
administration 

would have dipped into its 
massive endowment fund in 
order to provide financial 
support to its students, staff 
and faculty throughout the 
recession triggered by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Each 
of the demands arising from 
the 
University’s 
ResStaff, 

the residential advisors and 
employees 
of 
University 

Housing, would be met and 
respected. 
Students, 
who 

were forced to pay a $50 
COVID-19 fee for a safety kit 
whether they were returning 
to campus or not, would not 
be required to pick up said kit 
in person during limited time 
windows. The University’s 
COVID-19 Emergency Fund, 
funded by the Coronavirus 
Aid 
Relief 
and 
Economic 

Security 
Act, 
would 
be 

more widely advertised and 
accessible. 

At this point, it’s nearly 

impossible to argue that the 
University is still moving 
forward 
with 
its 
current 

reopening 
plan 
with 
the 

health 
and 
safety 
of 
its 

students, staff and faculty 
in mind. Schlissel and his 
administration 
are 
likely 

aware of how problematic 
their current plan is but are 
still moving forward with 
it — even their own COVID-
19 
Ethics 
and 
Privacy 

Committee explicitly stated 
its disapproval in a statement 
released on July 31. In order 
to 
take 
action, 
we 
must 

sign 
the 
#NotMICampus 

petition, sign and share this 
petition that demands the 
cancellation 
of 
in-person 

classes 
and 
email 
the 

President’s Office (presoff@
umich.edu) explaining our 
disdain 
for 
the 
current 

plans. 
Additionally, 
those 

who are willing and able 
to 
continue 
protesting 

must 
do 
so. 
If 
enough 

people 
put 
this 
pressure 

on the administration, the 
University 
may 
just 
do 

something about it.

Until then, stay safe Ann 

Arbor.

O

n Sunday, June 7, nine members of the Minneapolis City Council acknowledged that the current system of policing is not working 
and that they intend to “defund and dismantle” the city police department. Council President Lisa Bender stated, “(We need) to 
listen, especially to our Black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions 

lie in our community.” While still in the process of planning exactly what these new, transformative and community-based initiatives 
may look like, the goal is to implement a model of public safety that actually keeps each community safe. Conversations of defunding 
and dismantling police departments have popped up all over the country, and many are concerned about what exactly this means.

8 — Monday, August 31, 2020

At the turn of the 2010s, the 

ingenious use of social media 
by young activists during the 
Arab Spring set the world 
ablaze. In the blink of an eye, 
young 
people 
transformed 

social media from a prom pic-
ture party hub to an outlet of 
revolutionary information. Via 
fledgling platforms like Face-
book and Twitter, users shared 
demonstration sites, tear gas 
remedies and even tips to avoid 
identification by authorities 
should one choose to partici-
pate in civil disobedience. 

With 
its 
unprecedented 

ability to deliver not only cru-
cial information, but also the 
sights, sounds and unmistak-
able aura of social upheaval to 
the palm of any user’s hand, 
social media seemed to be the 
last missing link to achieving 
real global equality. 

In case you missed it, the 

2010s were not quite the pax 
romana we hoped they would 
be. 

Just shy of a decade after 

the events of the Arab Spring, 
social media’s stature as a 
beacon of hope, a catalyst of 
universal change has under-
gone quite the reversal. As 
Generation Z came of age over 
the course of the 2010s, we 
watched in real time as the 
sanctity of information found 
and distributed on social media 
was forever compromised. In 
addition to issues with misin-
formation, 
overwhelmingly, 

the outward facing nature of 
these platforms spawned a 
culture of normalized “slack-
tivism,” wherein the culti-
vation of the image of being 
“woke” by privileged groups 
has taken precedence over the 
actual substance of the soci-
etal issues which predicates 
such activism. The issues most 
often co-opted for social clout 
are related to the continued 
extrajudicial murder of count-
less Black Americans. But, this 
shouldn’t come as much of a 
surprise for a country which 
enjoys its temporary forays 
into Black culture more than 
Miley Cyrus. 

More so than any other 

instance of Black-led rebel-
lion seen in the previous 
decade, the most recent upris-
ings beginning on May 26 
have been characterized by a 
suspiciously high amount of 
white endorsement and par-
ticipation. But, these were not 
the usual white allies — these 
were white moderates. In the 
past week, my social media 
feeds have been flooded with 
the feverish reposting of art-
ist’s renditions of the deceased, 
text posts demanding account-
ability on the part of all non-
Black Americans and of course, 
the black tiles. Although an 
increased awareness of the 
horrors 
of 
police 
brutal-

ity appears, superficially, to be 
indicative of promising social 
progress, I cannot help but 
shake my suspicions that these 
displays — like most things on 
social media — are just a part 
of a facade. 

While my skepticism could 

be misconstrued as a selfish 
attempt to “gatekeep” who 
can and cannot be politically 
active, in reality, this cynicism 
is a byproduct of coming of 
age in the span of years sepa-
rating Trayvon Martin from 
George Floyd, Ferguson from 
Flint and Obama from Trump. 
Through these years, time and 
time again in school, and even 
in some social situations, I 
was looked to by my non-Black 
peers to rationalize why “all 
lives” and “blue lives” did not 
matter and why violence some-
times could be the only appro-
priate answer. And with each 
repetition of this cycle, with 
every new Black life taken pre-
maturely, the same peers still 
refused to educate themselves 
any further than the informa-
tion that was already labori-
ously spoon-fed to them by 
young Black people like myself, 

just clamoring to make their 
people’s humanity known. 

As I observed the same 

people who were once “so 
concerned” 
with 
educating 

themselves retreat back to the 
comfortability of their privi-
leged existences at their con-
venience, I began to see my 
efforts to inform had not just 
fallen on deaf ears, but actually 
replicated the existing system 
of Black subjugation to white-
ness — where still, Black labor 
is readily substituted in the 
place of white effort. 

Although many white Amer-

icans — particularly Gen Z’ers 
too self-righteous to recog-
nize their own similarities to 
their Boomer grandparents — 
are quick to ridicule the glar-
ing hypocrisies of attempts 
to appear “of the people” by a 
Kendall Jenner or Gal Gadot, 
significantly fewer conversa-
tions are being had regarding 
the abruptness with which 
they themselves hop on the 
bandwagon of social responsi-
bility, only to retreat back into 
the complicit silence of their 
“normal” existences once their 
friends stop posting Instagram 
stories, hashtags stop trending 
and the media moves on to the 
next Big Story™. It becomes 
difficult to read their mobili-
zation as anything but hollow 
box-checking, 
particularly 

when Black people watched the 
2010s close with no real prog-
ress made to the state of sanc-
tioned murder. Oh, and Donald 
Trump was elected president. 
So, there’s that. 

The desecration of social 

media from subversive outlet 
to vehicle of self-congratu-
latory displays is pretty well 
encapsulated with the trend 
that emerged earlier this week, 
#BlackoutTuesday. This phe-
nomenon, hauntingly similar 
to the promotional tactics used 
for Fyre Fest, involved non-
Black people posting an image 
of a black screen to their social 
media profiles. What was orig-
inally intended to be a mass 
silencing of the trivial uses of 
social media (e.g. beach selfies, 
Harry Styles fun facts) during 
a time of national protesting 
proved to be an all too easily 
accepted invitation for white 
people to engage in their favor-
ite political strategy: passive 
silence. Predictably, I awoke 
Tuesday morning from more 
participation than I had seen 
all week. My feed was now 
populated by more black tiles 
than a Home Depot, and not 
to my surprise, the majority 
of people posting these empty 
gestures had been relatively 
silent for the past week. 

In theory, this trend was 

intended 
to 
highlight 
the 

severity of the issue of police 
brutality and the importance 
of listening to Black voices. 
However, the eye-roll induc-
ing irony of this asinine trend 
is that it blatantly ignores the 
usefulness of privileged white 
voices to the movement. In 
civil rights history, substan-
tial change has only ever been 
achieved when those in privi-
leged positions finally feel 
compelled to stick their necks 
out for marginalized groups. 
When white people hold other 
white 
people 
accountable, 

magic happens. The only thing 
that has resulted from the 
proliferation of black squares 
has been a clogging of crucial 
hashtags with vacant displays 
of wokeness — a complete 180 
from the example set during 
the Arab Spring. 

But that’s the problem, isn’t 

it? The people who jump at 
the opportunity to conform 
to what they view as “trendy” 
give no credence to the his-
torical precedents of social 
protest. The same people vap-
idly posting the square because 
they saw someone cool do it 
have no discernible politi-
cal conscience beyond “I miss 
Obama” posts, and certainly 
have no grasp on Black his-
tory beyond what their APUSH 
teacher taught them. Posting 
a picture does not mean you 
have educated yourself on the 

complexities of systemic rac-
ism. Posting a picture does not 
mean you will diversify your 
social circle beyond who you 
went to high school with. Post-
ing a picture does not change 
the fact that your boyfriend 
voted for Trump. 

As our collective nostalgia 

for the socially transforma-
tive 1960s indicates, many 
young people have a desire to 
be swept up in a movement, to 
feel as though they are a part 
of something that will bring 
about positive change to their 
worlds. However, my burning 
(and 
unanswered) 
question 

for those suddenly compelled 
to channel Gloria Steniem is … 
where the fuck have you guys 
been? 

I acknowledge that, for those 

of us who have grown up Black 
and in America, the issue of 
police brutality is interwoven 
into the fabric of our existence. 
Whereas 
whiteness 
func-

tions to insulate people from 
the harsh realities of our rac-
ist country, Black people are 
met with constant reminders 
unmatched outside of our com-
munity. Despite this truth, so 
many white people’s collec-
tive realization of the urgency 
of these injustices smells a bit 
funky to me because … when 
have Black people ever been 
anything close to silent about 
our outrage with police brutal-
ity?

The maliciously fatal Min-

neapolis officer’s actions were, 
indeed, uniquely deplorable, 
but 
did 
mainstream 
white 

America forge a secret pact to 
just forget the Rodney King 
tapes? Were Philando Castille, 
Michael Brown, Eric Garner 
and Sandra Bland just figments 
of Black America’s imagina-
tion? George Floyd’s untimely 
death is nowhere close to being 
the first Black death at the 
hands of law enforcement, so 
why the shock? Why the refus-
al to look in the mirror when 
confronting how such a brutal 
system has been able to persist?

The amount of white Ameri-

cans shocked into action by the 
video is not indicative of prog-
ress, rather a pervasive culture 
of naivety. This newfound fer-
vor towards the Black cause 
only 
indicates 
a 
laughably 

obtuse ambivalence towards 
the last 10 years in America, 
let alone the last 400. As we 
find ourselves in week two of 
national protests and await the 
Moron-in-Chief’s 
legislative 

response. I have grown weary 
of social media’s role in the 
social revolution. I have grown 
weary of the cacophony of voic-
es repeating the same empty 
platitudes with no actual prog-
ress to match. 

A phrase which summates 

my frustration with America’s 
cyclical mishandling of police 
brutality is “History doesn’t 
repeat itself, but it rhymes.” 
While the issues being protest-
ed may not appear the exact 
same as the ones from 50 years 
ago, 
the 
principles 
under-

cutting each conflict remain 
unchanged. 
This 
phrase 

instantly comes to mind when-
ever I stumble across footage 
of elderly Black people march-
ing for similar, if not the same, 
causes they did when they 
were our age — revealing the 
depressing truth that they’ve 
spent an entire lifetime with-
out real rectification of soci-
etal issues. Band-Aid solution 
after Band-Aid solution. 

Regardless of the vogueish 

popularity 
of 
these 
social 

media trends in white spaces, it 
doesn’t appear as though any-
one is itching for the displays 
to end and the change to begin. 
Because if they did, I wouldn’t 
be writing this piece. So, white 
and non-Black America, if you 
want us to actually take your 
“activism” seriously, put your 
money where your mouth is. I 
would love to be proven wrong. 
As the privileged majority of 
the population, real change 
cannot happen without your 
efforts. So, let’s hope you’ve 
got something better dreamed 
up than Black tiles.

Ok, America. Prove me wrong.

The revolutionary nature of 

Glen Sean Coulthard’s book, “Red 
Skin, White Masks: Rejecting 
the Colonial Politics of Recogni-
tion,” serves as a salute to radical 
scholar Frantz Fanon’s postcolo-
nial work through its exposure of 
Canada’s systematic marginaliza-
tion of the Native population. In 
like manner, the piece introduces 
an uncomfortable notion of indoc-
trinated white values, instilled 
to naturalize the corruption of 
Indigenous culture and self-value 
which persist today in relation to 
the Aboriginals who suffer from 
psycho-affective attachments to 
colonialism and an internalized 
justification of their own subjuga-
tion. Coulthard proposes that this 
subconscious surrendering of the 
Aboriginal people creates a stable 
environment for the Canadians’ 
perpetual, yet subtle, reproduction 
of colonialism today. However, at 
some point, the colonized becomes 
“aware” of the colonizer, birthing 
resentment within the colonized, 
and forcing progress toward prop-
er recognition and reconciliation 
from the colonizer. 

Coulthard expresses modern 

society’s colonial persistence as 
straddled between the colonizer’s 
denial of the oppressive structure 
and the indoctrinated submission 
of the colonized. He does this by 
probing the non-Native’s refusal to 
decolonize through the implemen-
tation of “transitional justice” in a 
non-transitional structure and an 
ignorance regarding resentment’s 
political value. However, he goes 
on to challenge this “unchange-
able” system, making use of 
Fanon’s embracement of resent-
ment as an essential instrument in 
the resurgence of self and cultural 
affirmation. 

Attempts to reconcile injus-

tices against Canada’s Indigenous 
people have taken form of repara-
tive commissions and elaborate 
promises to rectify the unbalanced 
system, yet the implementation of 
these reparations have failed as a 
result of the non-Natives contra-
dictory denial of colonial history, 
and a palpable refusal to practice 
their own proposed processes. 

Meant to guide the Canadian 

State through a somewhat seam-
less process of reconciliation, the 
Royal Commission of Aboriginal 
Peoples details a productive prac-
tice of “transitional justice”: an 
approach to justice which must 
take place after the injustice has 
ceased and there is a clear distinc-
tion between the time of injustice 
and the time following. In Canada, 
society has perpetuated a “non-
transitional” loop that maintains 
the settler-colonial relationship 
and erases any distinction between 
that of the past, present and future. 
Coulthard explains that regard-
less, Canada wields the proposal 
of this transitional system to disas-
sociate past colonialism with their 
modern-day cultural hierarchy: 
“Where there is no period marking 
a clear or formal transition from 
an authoritarian past to a demo-
cratic present— state-sanctioned 
approaches 
must 
ideologically 

manufacture such a transition by 
allocating the abuses of settler 
colonisation to the dustbins of his-
tory.”

Canada relies on the internal-

ized system and manipulative 
policy enforcement which they 
exhaust to restrict the rights of 
Indigenous people. The enforce-
ment 
of 
extinguishment, 
the 

Modified Rights Approach, the 
non-assertion approach and the 
Jobs and Growth Bill Act all served 
as mediums of institutionalized 
outlets for Indigenous subjugation. 

Coulthard explains that decora-

tive language such as “restorative 
justice” creates an environment 
in which reconciliation becomes 
fixated on the “legacy of past 
abuse, not the abusive colonial 
structure itself.” When colonial 
corruption is categorized as his-
torical, it liberates the colonizer 
from responsibility in today’s 
disparate relationship, assuming 
blame to the colonized who must 
have an inability to move on. This 
way, the colonizer can maintain 

their systematic superiority by dis-
guising the current settler-colonial 
structure as an invalid, negative 
emotion harboured by the Natives 
toward the non-Natives which 
prevents the advancement of their 
mutual relationship. 

In embracing the standpoint of 

transitional justice, the colonizer 
assumes the Natives’ resentment 
to be irrational and it is framed 
as the primal perpetuator of the 
social and political instability at 
hand. This common misunder-
standing of resentment confuses 
the emotion for the subjectively 
less productive french term: res-
sentiment. Ressentiment is “por-
trayed as a reactive, backward, and 
passive orientation to the world;” 
under this definition, the once 
subjugated has been liberated in 
a literal sense but fosters this sub-
jugation in a conscious refusal to 
move on from the past, ultimately 
subjugating themselves. 

The difference between the 

two terms is resentment’s politi-
cized nature, making it a power-
ful foundation for reconciliation. 
Resentment is formed against 
a recognized “enemy of injus-
tice;” recognizing this “colonial 
enemy” frees the colonized from 
their internalized subjugation and 
compels them to revalidate their 
individual and cultural worth. 
Coulthard defines this Fanon-
inspired process as, “a purging, 
if you will, of the so-called ‘infe-
riority complex’ of the colonized 
subject … In such a context, the 
formation of a colonial ‘enemy’ … 
signifies a collapse of this internal-
ized psychic structure.” This lib-
eration starts with oneself, but the 
cultural validation also inspires a 
unified “us” that is now conscious 
enough to recognize specific injus-
tices and passionate enough to 
demand desired reparations. 

This is a necessary reallocation 

of the Indigenous peoples’ once 
internalized hatred and subju-
gation. Coulthard explains that 
this external reallocation creates 
an opportunity where “the colo-
nized begin to resent the assumed 
‘supremacy of white values’ that 
has served to ideologically justify 
their continued exploitation and 
domination.” Once these values 
are resented by the colonized, they 
realise that there is no justifying 
the long-indoctrinated exploita-
tion or domination of their cultural 
group, and therefore, there is no 
validation in colonialism or the 
persisting political structure. 

What makes resentment par-

ticularly powerful as a political 
tool, is the emotional passion. In 
numerous situations likening the 
colonial-settler relationship, the 
“inferior” is aware of their posi-
tion, but helpless or unmotivated 
in reversing the damage; resent-
ment instills the anger and pas-
sion that motivates action. In 
the summer of 1990, a political 
agreement that disregarded the 
rights of the Native peoples and a 
non-Native attempt to confiscate 
Native owned land inspired the 
unification of Indigenous people 
to protect and assert their inherent 
rights. This opposition energized a 
new movement for the Indigenous 
people in which they apply their 
resentment to action, rather than 
fostering it within; in the wake of 
this, the RCAP was created, rec-
ognizing the demands of the colo-
nized and responding respectively. 

“What originally began as an 

education campaign against a 
repugnant piece of federal legisla-
tion has since transformed into a 
grassroots struggle to transform 
the colonial relationship itself” 
(Coulthard 128). The proposal that 
an emotion serves as the founda-
tion for reconciling institutional 
colonialism sounds absurd. How-
ever, I assert that this is a nearly 
necessary step for the colonized 
to validate themselves and their 
culture, and vocalize the desire for 
legitimate reparation and revolu-
tion. 

In 
“Understanding 
Eth-

nic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and 
Resentment in Twentieth Cen-
tury Eastern Europe,” by Roger 
D. Peterson, and “On Resentment 
and Ressentiment: The Politics 
and Ethics of Moral Emotions,” 
by Didier Fassin, the two authors 
uncover 
an 
unacknowledged 

“victim” of some ambiguous sort, 
and debrief the instrumental role 
of these victims’ resentment in 
maintaining institutionalized dis-
crimination. Peterson interprets 
resentment as an emotion based 
on a nation or state’s structure, 
which when shifted or reversed 
hierarchically, angers the once 
ethnically-dominant, and if fea-
sible, leads to extreme ethnic vio-
lence. This interpretation strays 
from the notion that resentment 
follows a history of subjugation; 
However, what remains are clear 
distinctions between who causes 
the resentment, who possesses it 
and why. Despite the clarity of this 
approach, the manichean aspect 
removes the universality of such 
an emotion, almost restricting it 
to people who can directly credit 
their pain to a group, and restrict-
ing the “reaction” of resentment 
unto those who did the harm. Fas-
sin, however, recognizes the global 
accessibility of the emotion. 

Fassin 
specifically 
analyzes 

the French police force and their 
ambiguous resentment as a more 
societal and ideological position 
that they release unto a feasible 
target. This interpretation invites 
a more palpable understanding of 
resentment from the social and 
individual perspective. Both con-
cepts result in pragmatic institu-
tional discrimination: Peterson’s 
approach is rooted in a clear eth-
nic hierarchy that has been dis-
turbed and angers the formerly 
dominant to an extent of extreme 
violence, whereas Fassin’s concept 
accepts the obscurity of emotion 
and acknowledges the inaccurate 
direction of consequential emo-
tional expression.

In “Understanding Ethnic Vio-

lence,” Peterson delivers a concept 
of resentment that exists amongst 
the shattering of a distinguished 
ethnic structure, allocating blame 
to the oppressed who “wrongful-
ly” gained power and are resented 
by the “rightful” owners of said 
dominance who will eventually 
retaliate with role-establishing 
violence. This concept of resent-
ment relies on three necessities: 
a strongly established perception 
of ethnic hierarchy, the domi-
nant group amongst the hierarchy 
experience a role-reversal and this 
now subjugated group see correc-
tion through violence as a feasible 
option.

If a clear hierarchy is not estab-

lished, nor can be violence from 
resentment. This interpretation 
renders resentment similar to 
the emotions rooted in national-
ism which strive for an “ethnic 
homogenisation” where the “peas-
ant” and “imperial” populations 
are ruled out alongside resentment 
itself. Within these imagined and 
consequentially forced communi-
ties, there is no alien within the 
structure, nor is there any fear 
of role-reversal. Whether this 
approach to resentment remains at 
the large nation with a maintained 
hierarchical structure, or expands 
to the forced homogenized com-
munities, institutional discrimi-
nation is pursued at a structural 
level, rooted in the belief that the 
dominant deserves to be dominant 
at any justifiable means. 

Similarly pursuant of institu-

tionalised discrimination, Fassin 
explores resentment as it inhabits 
the French police force, the ambi-
guity of the emotion’s roots and the 
unfortunate misdirected reactivity 
on the “vulnerable.” Fassin claims 
the emotions felt by the police 
force are relational to the emo-
tions exhibited by the surrounding 
society: “the police are all the more 
aggressive since they view their 
public as hostile and through their 
aggressiveness render the public 
hostile.” This resentment against 
society, matched with the neces-
sity for efficacy leads to targeted 
brutality, and inherently perpetu-
ates the oppressive structure. 

This is not a justification of the 

cycle — rather a condemnation — 
but it is important to recognize the 
perspective that hierarchical roles 
possess in order to understand 
the process of one’s society on an 
ideological level. Assumption is 
political venom whether done by 
the subjugated or the subjugator, 
and equality can only see fruition 
alongside understanding.

Resentment: the politicization of 
emotion to liberate the colonized

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

he time to act is now. 
While COVID-19 may 
feel like it is pulling 

focus away from the issues 
that we care about, making it 
harder to communicate and 
plan actions and exhausting us 
emotionally and intellectually, 
there has never been a time 
where student action at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

especially 
collective 
action, 

will be as effective as it will 
be right now. The fundamental 
disruption 
COVID-19 
has 

caused 
to 
the 
four-year, 

traditional college model is 
the perfect storm for holding 
institutions accountable and 
making institutional change. 

The four-year college model 

is a contrived but carefully 
curated system of educational 
and social experience designed 
to 
sequester 
money 
from 

students while theoretically 
providing them avenues for 
personal 
and 
educational 

growth. This model relies on the 
expectation that students will 
be focused on themselves rather 
than the larger community. 
Known for its brand strength 
and disappointing track record 
on issues of transparency and 
social change, the University 
uses this model to keep student 
voices quiet during their time 
at the University. After two 
years of personal experience 
and conversations with friends, 
classmates, alumni and others 
I’ve 
distilled 
the 
general 

University of Michigan college 
experience into this theory: The 
U-M undergraduate experience 
is designed so that students 
only have one year of focused 
activism and social awareness 
before they graduate. 

Freshman year, the year 

of many firsts, is when the 
University 
plunges 
students 

into 
the 
deep 
maize-and-

blue sea of unwavering school 
pride. 
Summer 
orientation 

in East Quad Residence Hall, 
Convocation 
at 
the 
Crisler 

Center, the thrill of life away 
from parents, a fall of Michigan 
Football games, UMixes on 
weekends, 
fraternity 
and 

sorority rush, basement band 
shows and other quintessential 
dreams of freshman year leave 
little room to look around 
at the systemic injustices at 
the University. At its core, 
freshman year is spent learning 
how to go to college and being 
taught to unequivocally love 
the University of Michigan. 

Sophomore year, the year 

where the initial shine fades, 
is 
a 
time 
when 
students 

actually begin to learn and to 
open their eyes to the systems 
around them. The stresses of 
living off-campus, declaring 
a major, saving grade point 
averages and moving beyond 
freshman-year friendships, all 
begin to crack both the student 
and the facade created by the 
University. Students observe 
what appear to be isolated 
incidents: Administration and 
faculty members being accused 
of 
sexual 
misconduct, 
the 

University making decisions 
on important policy behind 
suspiciously 
closed 
doors 

and whispers of inequality 
at the Dearborn and Flint 
satellite 
campuses. 
With 

freshly 
awakened 
senses, 

the University begins to fear 
sophomores. 

Junior year: the year of 

awakening. While there are 
students both cognizant of 

the deep-seated institutional 
flaws and working to fight 
them throughout their entire 
career at the University, I’ve 
observed junior year is the 
year of change for most. No 
longer needing acclimation to 
college, and having spent two 
years at the University, many 
students open their eyes to the 
systemic problems that plague 
the administration. Two years 
of life at the University of 
Michigan is generally enough 
time to tear down the facade 
of compassion and community 
the University spends so much 
time and money cultivating 
our freshman year. Years of 
mistreatment, malpractice and 
lack of transparency shows that 
these are not isolated incidents 
but patterns of negligence, 
lack of care and betrayal. This 
realization leads many juniors 
to join activist groups, speak 
out about their experiences, and 
pressure the administration to 
make substantive change. Two 
years is enough for students 
to realize that the University 
does not have a commitment 
to 
transparency 
or 
action 

surrounding sexual assault and 
misconduct as seen through 
the need for the WilmerHale 
report 
and 
SMTD 
Climate 

Survey, and the allegations 
surrounding 
David 
Daniels, 

Stephen Shipps and Martin 
Philbert. Two years is enough 
for students to realize that the 
University does not commit 
to making itself do anything 
more than appear to care about 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
(DEI) initiatives, as evidenced 
by the constant mistreatment 
of the University of Michigan-
Flint and the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn, 
lack 
of 

substantive action on racial 
justice in the wake of the 
murder of George Floyd and 
Breonna Taylor and allowing 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security officers to remain 
armed. Two years is long 
enough for students to realize 
their voices will not be sought 
out 
when 
making 
critical 

and long-term decisions that 
affect them, especially the 
voices of disabled students, 
evidenced 
through 
the 

Michigan Union redesign and 
COVID-19 precautions. Two 
years is enough for many to 
realize 
the 
administration 

just 
doesn’t 
care, 
through 

actions like raising tuition 
during a pandemic and holding 
a University Board of Regents 
meeting 
without 
public 

comments when making this 
decision. 

Come senior year, many are 

either burned out and ready to 
leave or holding on as tightly 
as possible to the college 
experience vanishing before 
their eyes. Alumni I spoke 
to reflected on focusing on 
post-graduate plans or doing a 
highlight reel of their favorite 
experiences at the University, 

pivoting away from the drive 
and focus of their junior year 
work. Understandably, senior 
year is a time to begin parting 
ways with the University of 
Michigan. 

This 
model 
comforts 

the administration as they 
generally only bear the full 
brunt of a student’s activism 
and attention for one year. 
However, 
COVID-19 
has 

substantially 
disrupted 
this 

model for the first time in 
recent memory with students 
making the decision to take 
gap semesters, take classes 
fully remote and therefore 
become more distanced from 
the University. Student groups 
and activists must work to 
collectivize their efforts, push 
for broader support amongst 
the student body and apply as 
much pressure as possible on 
the administration. For the 
foreseeable future, all attention 
can and should be focused on the 
failings of the administration. 
No longer can the veil of game 
days, tailgates, late dinners in 
the dining hall with friends, 
on-campus events, musicals, 
Guy Fieri night at Mosher-
Jordan 
Hall 
and 
weekend 

ragers cloud the student body’s 
vision of the failings of the 
University administration. No 
“Go Blue” blinder will be put 
over the incoming freshman 
class’s eyes, this group being 
welcomed not by pageantry and 
celebration, but with increased 
tuition during a pandemic. 
We must turn their focus and 
anger towards the University’s 
mishandling 
of 
COVID-19 

that will likely affect them 
for years to come. We must 
propel sophomores to turn 
their nervous energy and stress 
into a driving force for the 
movement, no longer needing 
the year to fully realize the 
systemic issues behind their 
isolated observations. Finally, 
no longer will seniors be able 
to relive their previous years 
on campus or be distracted 
by endless and extensive job 
searches. We must turn their 
focus and frustration towards 
leaving the University a better 
place than it was when they 
arrived for leadership for the 
initial push. 

Already 
groups 
and 
pages 

like 
@blackatmichigan, 

@FightBackUMich, 
@

AbolishMichiganIFCandPanhel, 
@HowCouldWeTrustUM 
and 

Students Demand Representation 
have been making appeals to 
both the student body and 
administration, 
cognizant 

of 
the 
critical 
window 
of 

opportunity to make change. 
Collectivizing these missions 
into coalition-like efforts will 
make these ripples into waves. 
Activist groups must seize this 
time to get their message out 
and consolidate their efforts, 
and work with other groups to 
mobilize action, even across 
seemingly 
disparate 
fields. 

The intersectionality between 
issues of racial justice, sexual 
assault 
and 
misconduct, 

COVID-19 care and general 
transparency issues will make 
collective 
efforts 
effective 

during this unprecedented and 
limited window of action. The 
time is now. Let’s work hard, 
work together and teach our 
leadership how to be Leaders 
and The Best.

Dear student activists

ANDREW GERACE | COLUMNIST

T

he first thing I ever 
thrift shopped for was a 
University of Michigan 

sweatshirt. For just six dollars, 
I got the opportunity to wear 
the block M on my sleeve for the 
first time — and as I would find 
out about a year later, it wasn’t 
the last. Getting to rep my dream 
school wasn’t the only reason I 
showed off that sweatshirt for 
months. I thought that, because I 
thrifted it, I was single-handedly 
saving the planet, the next best 
thing to personally picking every 
piece of plastic out of the ocean 
and closing the hole in the ozone 
layer myself. 

But what was I actually 

doing? In terms of the bigger 
picture of saving the planet, the 
answer is honestly “nothing.” 
The idea of “shopping ethically” 
is everywhere in the world of 
fashion, where it’s marketed as 
the alternative to fast fashion. 
Defined 
by 
Investopedia 
as 

designs that “move quickly from 
the catwalk to stores to meet new 
trends,” fast fashion comprises 
the majority of the retail market. 
Despite the evidence that fast 
fashion, made from microfibers 
that don’t decay, is harming our 
planet in more ways than one, 
it was worth $35 billion in 2015. 
This figure can seem absurd at 
first glance, but it makes sense 
given how many iconic stores are 
classified as fast fashion, many of 
them adorned by college students. 
There are the obvious ones like 
Fashion Nova, H&M and Forever 
21, as well as Romwe, Shein and 
Urban Outfitters, the latter of 
which has operated a location on 
the first floor of the historic The 
State Theatre for years. 

Though it seems like fast 

fashion is here to stay, sustainable 
brands such as well-established 
Patagonia, Levi’s and newcomers 
like 
The 
Reformation 
and 

Everlane, have risen in popularity 
as people make the decision to 
shop ethically. These brands 
have become as popular as they 
are because — to a former Shein 
customer, for example — they’re 
refreshing in their approach 
to 
garment-making. 
More 

often than not, many of these 
sustainable brands are based 
in the United States and are 
transparent about the processes 
behind their clothes. As more 
and more people indicate that 
they would be willing to pay more 
for sustainable fashion, they’ve 
become forces in the fashion 
industry in their own right, not 
just an alternative but a first 
choice.

A first choice among thin 

consumers with money, that is.

One of the major criticisms 

of sustainable fashion is how it 
lacks inclusivity. From the Good 
Trade’s list of sustainable brands, 
only three carry sizes above a 2XL, 
equivalent to a 20/22. Most carry 
up to XL, capping their styles at 
a size 14. Think about that. In an 
era where the average American 
woman is between a size 16 and 18, 
many sustainable brands act like 
those sizes don’t even exist. 

Even if a customer is lucky 

enough to fit into limited size 
ranges, they still face the obstacle 
of just how expensive these brands 
are. Though they’re pricey for good 
reason, not everyone can afford to 
spend $74 on a blouse. Growing up 
low-income, I was always taught to 
“make money stretch.” The $98.00 
spent on a pair of skinny jeans from 
Levi’s, I was told, could be taken to 
H&M instead, where I could buy 
five pairs of the same jeans. For 
many other low-income folks using 
the same logic, shopping from 
sustainable brands just doesn’t 
make sense. For us, the immense 
relative cost simply outweighs the 
environmental benefits.

“If you can’t afford it, why not 

thrift?” is something I’ve heard 
and unfortunately said myself. 
From the moment I bought my 
sweatshirt, I began playing into 
the assumption that thrifting is 
somehow the perfect way to shop 
ethically and sustainably. But 
the concern of accessibility with 
buying from sustainable brands 
applies to thrifting, too. Contrary 
to popular belief, thrifting isn’t so 
affordable anymore. Giants like 
Goodwill and Salvation Army 
have raised prices in response to 
the rising interest in their stores 

stoked by thrift haul videos like 
these. Money isn’t the only issue 
in terms of affordability — low-
income folks can’t afford the time 
required to comb through racks 
of clothes to find something that 
fits. For people working multiple 
jobs or long hours at just one, 
thrifting is nearly impossible. 
This is especially true if they’re 
plus-sized, where an already 
limited 
stock 
of 
plus-sized 

clothing is often bought by thin 
people riding the trend of the 
oversized t-shirt. 

So what are we supposed to 

do? If both of our sustainable 
options are bad and fast fashion 
is worse, where are we supposed 
to buy clothes?

Truth be told, there’s no 

answer to this question. There’s 
no “one size fits all” solution 
to the issue of fast fashion 
because of how diverse we are as 
consumers and as people. I think 
it’s easy to dismiss all of this by 
saying there is no ethical form 
of consumption in late-stage 
capitalism, so obviously people 
should just buy what they want, 
but that isn’t quite right either. 
It’s true that it’s impossible to live 
in a consumer society without 
causing harm in some way, but 
that means our goal should be to 
reduce this harm to the best of 
our individual abilities. 

Though I wasn’t doing much 

by buying just one sweatshirt, I 
was doing what I could. I whad 
the time and money to thrift, so 
I did, and I wore that sweatshirt 
for almost two years. When I 
no longer loved it the same way 
I had when I first saw it back in 
November of 2018, I sold it in 
Depop and gave it to another girl 
who loves the University as much 
as I did then.

So the next time you go to 

buy a new pair of jeans for a 
Friday night or a suit jacket for 
an interview, I want you to think 
about your options. I can’t tell you 
which is best, but I can ask you to 
think about this: Who loses from 
what you gain?

2020: The importance of perspective

T

his year has been a 
memorable 
one 
in 

arguably too many ways. 

As a political science student, it 
has definitely been uncomfortably 
uneasy to be such an active part 
of writing history, unable to flip 
a few pages and read how it will 
all play out. We crave certainty, 
answers — something concrete 
to reassure us that the chaos will 
come to an end. However, as the 
summer continues, I’ve done a 
lot of personal reflection. Is 2020 
really just continuously sucking, 
or is some part of this a result of 
my own perspective? Naturally, as 
one does, I took to the internet. It 
turns out that there is a great deal 
of research indicating that there 
are both positives and negatives to 
the “2020 strikes again” rhetoric. 
As a society, we need to start 
acknowledging both positions in 
order to preserve our own mental 
health and awareness as the year 
comes to a close. 

Whether it be the pandemic, 

the (justifyingly) divisive political 
atmosphere, the looming election, 
a hurricane on the East Coast or 
the raging wildfires on the West 
Coast, it is undeniable that there 
has been what has seemed to be 
unending awfulness to the start 
of the new decade. Speaking on a 
personal note, my entire family 
contracted 
COVID-19 
at 
the 

very beginning of the pandemic, 
likely due to my family members 
working in NYC. Thankfully, we 
all escaped the virus relatively 
unscathed and with the presence 
of antibodies; I tried to count 
my blessings and confront my 
own gratitude for none of my 
seven infected family members 
falling ill enough to be admitted 
to a hospital or be hooked on a 

ventilator. I will admit that this 
positive outlook seemed to not fit 
within the dialogue of 2020. 

If it is all written out and placed 

chronologically, it really does 
seem like the bad news never ends. 
I even saw a TikTok recently that 
described the “best part of 2020” 
as the lack of societal shock to 
literally anything. The TikTok 
user claimed he could convince 
anyone that trees were coming 
alive and attacking people and 
nobody 
would 
be 
surprised. 

Thinking more deeply about this 
perspective and the motivation 
to expect the worst of what 
has already been a historically 
devastating year, it becomes nearly 
impossible to recognize when 
anything not-awful happens.

According 
to 
Dr. 
Susan 

Whitbourne, 
a 
Professor 

Emeritus of Psychological and 
Brain Sciences at the University 
of 
Massachusetts 
Amherst, 

“Cognitive theory predicts that 
the negative beliefs you hold 
about yourself, or your self-
schemas, cause you to view 
your 
experiences 
through 
a 

distorted set of perceptions.” The 
more negatively you anticipate 
something to turn out, the more 
likely you are to recognize the 
negative aspects in anything 
that happens. Of course, this is 
not to undermine or at all lessen 
the severity of so many horrible 
events that have transpired in 
the past eight months. Instead, it 
is perhaps an encouragement we 
societally could benefit from: take 
a deep breath and hope for better 
things ahead. Conversely, there 
is also much to be said about the 
potential benefits of “2020 strikes 
again” rhetoric as a means to 
make light of a really emotionally 

challenging situation. Sometimes, 
making jokes or implementing 
sardonic humor can help lessen 
the weight of a troublesome 
circumstance. Dr. Gil Greengross, 
an 
evolutionary 
psychologist 

from 
Aberystwyth 
University, 

emphasizes, 
however, 
that 
it 

is also important to recognize 
possible negative consequences 
to an over-abundance of “negative 
styles of humor.” 

Over the past few months, I’ve 

accepted my role as a statistic in 
an eternally historical dataset 
of 
positive 
test 
results. 
I’ve 

confronted my white privilege 
as a female in an affluent New 
Jersey suburb. I’ve fought for 
justice, weathered a power-outage 
inducing hurricane, a tornado 
one town over and struggled 
through personal dilemmas with 
relationships and mental health. 
This year has absolutely been 
the worst year I’ve experienced 
thus far in my two decades of 
life. Of course, my experience is 
comparatively minuscule to so 
many individuals and families I 
can’t help but pray for despite my 
lack of faith. 

The year 2020 may go down as 

one of the worst in history, but it’s 
time to try and hope for better. I 
won’t stop laughing at the memes 
or partaking in the depressing, 
cynical humor on occasion. But I 
plan to make a conscious effort to 
watch the undulations of the world 
as it continues to ebb and flow 
through crisis and catastrophe; 
the human race has conquered 
so much in our past, let us now 
have faith in what we hope to be a 
positive future.

A

s K-12 students across the 
country prepare for the 
2020-2021 school year, 

mounting research suggests that 
school districts can welcome 
students back to the classroom 
safely. However, from here in 
Ann Arbor to large cities like 
Chicago and Los Angeles, a 
flurry of school leaders have 
signed off on plans to keep 
millions of students home for 
remote learning in response to 
the ongoing COVID-19 threat.

There are clear reasons for 

the widespread push toward 
distance learning, at least to kick 
off the upcoming school year. 
Since the coronavirus has the 
potential to spread easily in large 
gathering places like schools, 
experts fear that a return to 
in-person learning would spark 
a surge in COVID-19 infections. 
At a time when the United States 
just surpassed a total of 5 million 
confirmed 
coronavirus 
cases, 

many officials, students and 
health experts don’t think now is 
the right time to bring thousands 
of students together to learn.

It is obvious that a return 

to in-person learning in the 
middle of this public health 
crisis carries risks. But evidence 
is increasingly emerging that 
the risks of keeping students at 
home are even higher. According 
to a statement released by 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 

Pediatrics, “children learn best 
when physically present in the 
classroom. 
But 
children 
get 

much more than academics at 
school. They also learn social 
and emotional skills at school, 
get healthy meals and exercise, 
mental health support and other 
services that cannot be easily 
replicated online. Schools also 
play a critical role in addressing 
racial and social inequity.”

The truth is that while remote 

learning may curb the spread 
of COVID-19, it has devastating 
implications for all K-12 students, 
especially younger-aged children. 
Regardless of what many school 
leaders 
say 
about 
distance 

learning, it is nowhere near an 
acceptable replacement for the 
in-person 
education 
that 
so 

many students depend on. While 
many are expecting the second 
round of remote learning to be an 
improvement over the first in the 
spring — when the coronavirus 
first shut down our economy — 
it is becoming increasingly clear 
that the distance learning this 
fall will be another nightmare for 
students and parents alike.

According to the Washington 

Post, “America is about to embark 
on Round 2 of its unplanned 
experiment in online education 

— and, for millions of students, 
virtual 
learning 
won’t 
be 

any better than it was in the 
spring.” As reported in the 
same Washington Post article, 
students will face numerous 
hurdles if forced to learn online 
this school year. In addition to 
instructors’ lack of experience 
with remote learning, “millions 
of 
students 
nationwide 
still 

lack 
devices 
and 
Internet 

access.” In the end, as risky as 
the COVID-19 threat remains, 
school leaders must weigh the 
equally dangerous impacts of 
inadequate learning from home, 
especially on students from 
poorer backgrounds. At a time 
when every student deserves 
a high-quality education more 
than ever, distance learning is 
deeply problematic.

While it’s painfully obvious 

that students will get an inferior 
education online, the threats that 
remote learning pose to student 
development 
go 
far 
beyond 

academics. More than ever, an 
abundance of evidence suggests 
that 
distance 
learning 
has 

disastrous social and emotional 
consequences 
for 
students, 

raising 
the 
chance 
that 
a 

destructive mental health crisis 
will arise from online classes. 
After the first round of remote 
learning earlier this year led 
to an increase in anxiety, 
depression 
and 
suicidal 
or 

self-harming 
thoughts 
for 

school-aged 
children, 
we 

cannot afford to make the same 
mistake twice. In addition to 
a way for students to develop 
academically, 
socially 
and 

emotionally, in-person classes 
also serve as a safe haven 
for students who come from 
troubled backgrounds and are 
endangered by violence and 
abuse at home. A significant 
number 
of 
school 
districts 

and law enforcement officers 
continue to voice concerns 
that 
distance 
learning 

prevents teachers and school 
administrators from finding out 
about abuse and intervening for 
the benefit of the student.

Finally, 
besides 
the 
direct 

impacts of online learning on 
students, a distance education has 
alarming effects on our economy, 
which is already struggling in the 
midst of the ongoing coronavirus 
crisis. One of the most glaring 
and obvious impacts of remote 
learning is the inconveniences 
and troubles it brings for working 
parents, many of whom are already 
suffering financially. As a result 
of mandatory distance learning, 
parents are forced to commit 
less time to their jobs so they can 
help their students successfully 
learn from home. Many others 
must also turn to costly child care 
options who have no other choice, 
which puts additional financial 
strain on families.

In the end, it’s overwhelmingly 

clear that distance learning is no 
match for the valuable experiences 
that students derive from an 
in-person education. In addition to 
the inarguable and vast drawbacks 
to distance learning, research 
increasingly demonstrates that 
schools can reopen safely and 
intelligently in the age of COVID-
19, with both in-person and hybrid 
options available. Meanwhile, as 
our understanding of the novel 
coronavirus 
deepens, 
it 
has 

become exceedingly evident that 
COVID-19 is a mild illness for the 
vast majority of infected children. 
According to medical research 
published by Mayo Clinic, “While 
all children are capable of getting 
the virus that causes COVID-19, 
they don’t become sick as often as 
adults. Most children have mild 
symptoms or no symptoms.” At 
the same time, numerous experts 
also suggest that even if children 
do contract the coronavirus from 
in-person classes, the chance that 
they will transmit COVID-19 to 
higher-risk individuals remains 
low.

At this point, the evidence 

makes it exceptionally clear that 
schools can reopen safely in the 
presence of strict safety measures 
— including social distancing, 
hand washing and face coverings 
— and provide an enriching and 
high-quality education for all K-12 
students across the nation. While 
in-person classes do not come 
without risks to public health, the 
extreme risks posed by distance 
learning models are far deeper 
for both students and society as a 
whole. School leaders who have 
moved the beginning of the 2020-
2021 school year online have an 
obligation to their students and 
their communities to make plans 
for in-person or hybrid classes 
immediately.

Benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks

L

et’s take a moment of 
silence. Take this time to 
reflect. To mourn. We have 

lost a valued member of our college 
experience — athletics. On Monday, 
Aug. 10, Big Ten Commissioner 
Kevin Warren announced the 
conference 
postponed 
all 
fall 

competition, including our beloved 
gameday weekends, until further 
notice because of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic. The entire 
season is likely all but canceled. To 
call this a “tragedy” is a massive 
understatement. 
“The 
selfish 

answer is that I am sad because I 
want to watch sports,” Business 
freshman Matthew Berube said. 
“But at the same time, I think 
(canceling fall sports season) is 
smart. I have been hearing about all 
these athletes getting coronavirus 
and it has become really bad. With 
this new ruling, they can now return 
quicker when it is safe.”

Like many of you, I was 

enthusiastic 
about 
collegiate 

athletics and everything that comes 
with them. From prior experience, 
there is nothing more satisfactory 
than the crisp autumn air, a sea of 
maize and blue and singing “The 
Victors” at the top of your lungs. 
For freshmen, this is just another 
disappointment in our already 
dismal year. If you’re like me, there’s 
the reason you told everyone you 
chose the greatest university in 
the world — academics, the alumni 
network, etc. — but then there’s the 
other major factor in your decision: 
football Saturdays. 

Yet before we grab our pitchforks 

and storm Director of Athletics 
Warde Manuel’s office, we should 
realize that the University of 
Michigan is just as heartbroken 
as we are. In any other difficult 
situation, our leaders would combine 
their respective intelligence and 
figure out a creative solution. Except 
we live in a world where one must 
both clothe their faces and stand 
72 inches away from one another 

at all times. How can we expect a 
myriad of contact sports, as well as 
those played in an indoor facility, to 
survive this virus’s wrath? 

Think about it: Linemen crashing 

into each other like wrecking 
balls every snap, two volleyballers 
meeting at the top of the nylon 
and sweaty locker rooms? I don’t 
think Dr. Fauci would approve. If 
you’re still skeptical of the motives 
behind the decision, look no further 
than the University’s pockets. By 
canceling fall sports, the University 
has sacrificed $122.3 million in 
football revenue, according to the 
U.S. Department of Education, and 
an estimated loss of $85 million 
to the city of Ann Arbor, via local 
business owners. 

If there’s one thing all of us 

have experienced these past six 
months, it’s making unpopular 
choices. We’re staying at home for 
the fall term instead of showering 
in a community bathroom. We’re 
isolating ourselves for the last 
fourteen days of summer when we 
should be soaking up the final rays 
of sunshine in our hometowns. 

We’re forcing ourselves to choose 

our heads over our hearts. It’s not 
necessarily healthy, but then again 
neither is contracting COVID-19. 

It’s why we, as students, should 

be able to understand the difficulty 
of this decision on both sides. Even 
though deleting fall competition 
from our agendas is undoubtedly 
infuriating, we cannot let it distract 
us from the ultimate goal: complete 
safety 
among 
the 
University 

community. In our attempt to 
achieve it, we must carry on valiantly. 
We must not become complacent 
with the current condition of our 
athletic climate, but rather seek 
to improve it by continuing to do 
our part: Masking up, washing our 
hands frequently and staying six 
feet away from each other. As of 
Aug. 14, Michigan athletics has two 
new COVID-19 cases out of 254 
tested, via the Detroit Free Press. 

The University is already taking 

a massive risk. Allowing students 
to live in dorms, occupy common 
areas like the Michigan Union and 
inevitably congregate — all while 
abiding by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s guidelines 
— is a lofty request at best. At the 
University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill, they’ve switched to 
total remote learning to reduce 
residential density. Little brother 
did the same. 

Could we be next? Maybe. One 

thing is for sure: If the University 
can attempt to safely accommodate 
us, we can patiently stand by for 
a safe resumption of athletics in 
return. 

College sports, in their infinite 

wisdom, have illustrated that the 
proper amount of time can improve 
the outcome of a player or team. Joe 
Burrow was a backup quarterback 
at The School That Shall Not Be 
Named for two years. In his senior 
season at Louisiana State University, 
he won the Heisman Trophy and 
a national championship, then 
became the first pick in the NFL 
draft. 

College sports also unite us 

through a common love of the 
game. If nothing else, the Big Ten’s 
decision verified the infectious 
passion that we have for our 
colleges. The shared despair is 
unprecedented, but then again, so 
are these times. 

This is why, when we comfortably 

return from this problematic state 
in the world, collegiate athletics will 
still be there. They will embrace 
us with open arms and an electric 
environment for us to revel in once 
again. 

In the meantime, we wait. The 

passion that athletes share for their 
sports is not lost on us, but neither 
is the well-being of our campus 
population.

F

rom the end of World 
War II through the pres-
ent day, the United States 

has maintained a position as the 
world’s premier superpower. For 
decades, the American values of 
hard work, individualism, liber-
alism and free-market capitalism 
appeared to lead to massive suc-
cesses, including technological 
advancement, 
economic 
pros-

perity and high standards of liv-
ing. However, as COVID-19 has 
exposed, the values which people 
once associated with America’s 
brand of strength and prosperity 
now appear antiquated and out-
dated and are ultimately holding 
the U.S. back. While countries 
around the world have respond-
ed to the virus in different ways, 
American society’s fundamen-
tal focus on individualism, free-
dom and economic growth have 
exposed the inequality, distrust 
of government institutions and 
lack of protections for vulnerable 
populations within our country. 

First and foremost, the spread 

of COVID-19 has highlighted 
America’s 
extreme 
inequality, 

something which is largely a prod-
uct of American society’s fanati-
cal devotion to economic growth. 
As economist Milton Friedman 
declared in a 1970 New York 
Times Magazine article, “The 
Social Responsibility of Business 
is to Increase its Profits.” In the 
decades since Friedman’s arti-

cle was published, it’s clear that 
America has taken his advice to 
heart. Today, the U.S. has 10 of the 
world’s 20 most profitable compa-
nies, but at a cost: It also ranks 
39th worst in income inequal-
ity, worse than countries such as 
Angola, the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and Turkmenistan. 
Last year, a study found that 
nearly 60 percent of Americans 
had less than $1,000 in their bank 
accounts, another sign of Ameri-
ca’s staggering income inequality. 

Unsurprisingly, 
America’s 

focus on profits, and its accep-
tance of the inequalities that phi-
losophy inherently produces, has 
greatly contributed to the nation’s 
disastrous response to COVID-
19. On April 21, a day on which 
over 2,600 Americans died of the 
virus, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick 
said that “there are more impor-
tant things than living and that’s 
saving this country.” Similarly, 
former New Jersey Gov. Chris 
Christie 
commented, 
“there 

are going to be deaths no mat-
ter what,” but “we have to stand 
up for the American way of life.” 
In saying this, Christie clearly 
implied that the American way of 
life is primarily focused on eco-
nomic growth — inequality and 
public health be damned. When 
faced with skyrocketing unem-
ployment rates, the U.S. Congress 
was both unwilling and unable to 
come up with an economic solu-

tion that addressed America’s 
income inequality. Although the 
federal government ultimately 
sent out a one-time $1,200 stimu-
lus check to citizens, by April 23, 
only 10 days after the first checks 
were deposited, 84 percent of 
Americans said they already 
needed another check to make 
ends meet. That federal relief bill, 
which cost over $2 trillion in total, 
simply proved how unassailable 
American inequality has become. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has 

also revealed the problems with 
the American society’s support 
of free-market capitalism, as 
workers often find themselves 
under-protected and devoid of 
rights. Although there has con-
sistently been some opposition 
to America’s overly laissez-faire 
attitude — such as Upton Sinclar’s 
1906 novel “The Jungle” — sup-
port for deregulation and limited 
government oversight of the pri-
vate sector is a major component 
of both America’s society and 
economy. As of 2015, American 
employees worked an average 
of 1,779 hours per year, the sev-
enth most of any nation globally. 

W

hat felt like a distant 
reality for the past six 
months is finally here. 

In just few short weeks, students 
across the nation will be reckoning 
with school start-ups — whether 
that means cautiously moving 
into a new apartment on campus 
or logging onto Canvas from your 
hometown. As we gear up for the 
long-anticipated 
fall 
semester, 

inboxes are filled with campus-
wide public health-advised guide-
lines for courses, clubs and sports, 
and I can’t help but feel a little 
nostalgic for a time before COVID-
19 and masks. The optimist in me 
had hoped that summer would be 
the end of it, but now a corona-less 
future seems unimaginable — or at 
least until 2024. Working at a local 
grocery store this summer, I feel 
my current cynicism deepen with 
every customer that refuses to 
wear a mask during their 10-min-
ute grocery runs despite Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 
statewide 

orders — that, and seeing videos 
and Snapchat stories of “COVID-
19 petri dish” parties and gather-
ings. 

I’d like to think my peers and I 

will be more responsible and con-
siderate on campus, but higher risk 
of infection on college grounds 
across the country has already 
been deemed inevitable by a New 
York Times survey prior to the 
new academic year. Unfortu-
nately, this is not all that surpris-

ing given the night-life crowds 
that took over Ann Arbor bars 
after Whitmer’s rescinding of 
the Safer at Home Order in June 
and Theta Chi’s careless summer 
kickback. Our image as the Lead-
ers and the Best was rightfully 
scrutinized then, and it is bound 
to face even heavier surveillance 
during this experimental semester. 

As university students, it’s high 

time our increasingly expensive 
schooling be put to productive use 
this semester. According to a New 
York Times article, we are impul-
sive, risk-taking college students 
that study together, live together, 
party together and sleep together. 
And they’re right. As thousands 
of students are welcomed back, 
campuses will become what psy-
chologists call a strong situation 
in which external environmen-
tal forces define the desirability 
of potential behaviors despite an 
individual’s personal tendencies 
and personality. This is especially 
true in cultural systems like that of 
universities where the norm is the 
often anti-intellectual nature of 
college student culture. The endur-
ing coronavirus calls for a reevalua-
tion of hookup culture and reckless 
school spirit, and we must be the 
ones at the forefront of this battle 
against amateur human tendency. 

While 
reopening 
campuses 

seems like a doomed endeavor 
from the beginning, we should 
take this opportunity to rede-

fine our college experience apart 
from tailgating and Thursday 
night excursions — whether that 
means spending more time on 
Zoom meetings and nights in, or 
looking deeper into the flaws of 
our own college culture. Amid a 
global pandemic that doesn’t seem 
to be going anywhere any time 
soon, it’s time for a cultural reset, 
if you will — one that encompasses 
a little more accountability for 
our actions. The only question is: 
Are we up for the challenge? For 
everyone’s sake, I sure hope so. 

This quarantine period has 

woken America up to the glaring 
systemic issues of highly politi-
cized public health initiatives, 
structural racism within every 
established institution and the col-
lateral damage from U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement 
policies. It would be for naught if 
we did not bring those issues back 
to our own schooling as many have 
done with the newly resurfaced 
review and reassessment petition 
for the University of Michigan’s 
Race and Ethnicity requirement 
as well as the student-led peti-
tion in response to ICE’s recent 
international student regulation. 

Closer to the University of Michi-
gan’s campus, in Ypsilanti, Mich., 
protesters gathered on the after-
noon of Tuesday, May 26, after 
a video was circulated showing 
a white police officer punch-
ing Sha’Teina Grady El, a Black 
woman, in the head multiple times. 

Building 
awareness 
about 

and a consensus against these 
horrific, racist acts of vio-
lence has to be a priority. But 
doing so safely and effectively 
is important as a pandemic 
rages on and police depart-
ments continue to aggressive-
ly crackdown on those who 
speak truth to their power. 

First, it is imperative to offer 

a historical context into the 
nature 
of 
policing 
agencies 

in America when wanting to 
approach conversations about 
the current Black Lives Matter 
protests occurring across Amer-
ica and around the world. The 
birth of modern-day police offi-
cers in America can be traced to a 
multitude of political, economic, 
legal and historical conditions. 
Most 
importantly, 
perhaps, 

modern policing departments 
can be traced to slave patrols 
and night watch groups, which 
were both maliciously designed 
to control the behaviors and 
freedoms of minorities — most 
notably Black and Native Ameri-
cans. In the southern colonies 
of the United States especially, 
origins of policing were root-
ed in racialized social orders 
and in the economy that so 
heavily depended on individu-
als that were enslaved. Slave 
patrols 
and 
night 
watches 

assisted wealthy landowners 
and maintained economic order 
by recovering and punishing 
both enslaved and freed Black 
individuals who did not adhere 
to white societal standards. 

The vicious and abhorrent 

rationalizations of slavery and 
racism did not end after the 13th 
amendment abolished slavery in 
the U.S. With the rise of so-called 
vigilante groups who resisted 
abolition and Reconstruction 
after the Civil War, America 
continued to perpetuate deep 
racism, oppression and injustice 
toward Black Americans. Due 
to the traditions of slavery and 
racism that are, unfortunately, 
so deeply embedded within this 
country’s history, these vigi-
lante groups felt it their duty to 
uphold the narrative that Black 
individuals were sub-human. 

Coinciding with the onset of 

the second phase of post-Civil 

War Reconstruction, the most 
infamous vigilante group, the 
Ku Klux Klan, was founded. 
Notorious for brutal campaigns 
of violence against Black indi-
viduals, “local law enforcement 
officials either belonged to the 
Klan or declined to take action 
against it.” Due to law enforce-
ment’s involvement with the 
infamous group, Congress even-
tually passed the Enforcement 
Act of May 1870 and two more 
Force acts — also known as the 
Ku Klux Klan acts — which 
acted to prohibit the assembly 
of groups with the intention of 
violating constitutional rights of 
minority groups. However, this 
legislation, along with many 
more legal events, has not sup-
pressed the inhumane practices 
of racial abuse and oppression 
that have persisted in America. 

Today, we are witnessing the 

continued perpetuation of racial 
injustices and violence from 
modern-day institutions against 
Black Americans. From being 
disproportionately affected by 
health inequalities that have 
been made most apparent during 
COVID-19 to repetitive injustic-
es perpetuated by the criminal 
justice systems in America, it is 
clear that what has been done so 
far is not nearly enough. Dur-
ing this global pandemic, many 
disparities and corrupt systems 
have come to light — ranging 
from the exploitations of essen-
tial workers who are primarily 
POC to healthcare inequalities 
and biases to precariously unfair 
shortages of protective equip-
ment 
for 
frontline 
work-

ers — which has undeniably 
showcased where the values 
of our country’s leaders lie.

While our healthcare workers 

are “at war with no ammo” — 
forced to use expired masks and 
perform invasive procedures 
on COVID-19 patients without 
any personal protective equip-
ment — local police forces tout 
a saturation of protective gear 
and riot gear when confront-
ing protesters. This disparity 
forces the financial hypocri-
sy of this country to light. In 
response to the jarring lack of 
PPE for healthcare workers, 
President Donald Trump stat-
ed, “the Federal government 
is not supposed to be out there 
buying vast amounts of items 
and then shipping … we’re not 
a shipping clerk.” However, he 
quickly changed tune when 
American citizens took to the 
streets to protest, mobilizing 

nearly a dozen federal agen-
cies to “dominate” protesters. 

Right now, it is most impor-

tant to stay safe and keep 
friends, community members 
and loved ones safe as well. 
However, The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board understands 
the boundless difficulties of 
doing just that when our coun-
try is fighting both the COVID-
19 pandemic and racism. The 
fact that Black communities 
are having to gather in large 
numbers during a pandemic to 
protest their right to stay alive, 
all the while being dispropor-
tionately disposed to having 
higher rates of non-communi-
cable diseases is not lost on us. 
This is why we, as an editorial 
board, encourage resourceful, 
respectful and safe protesting. 

Because of the pandemic, 

many individuals who would 
normally opt to practice activ-
ism in person at protests are not 
able to. This may be the result 
of immunocompromised fam-
ily members, personal health 
reasons, working essential jobs, 
etc. If this is the case, there are 
many ways to protest unjust, 
racially 
oppressive 
systems 

from home. Considering donat-
ing to bailout funds for protest-
ers who have been arrested, 
boycotting 
organizations 
or 

businesses that continue to 
perpetuate racism or exploit 
Black 
creators, 
researching 

ways to stop offering funds to 
local policing agencies while 
simultaneously 
supporting 

Black businesses are some of 
the first steps one could make. 

Social media right now is 

a huge platform for activism, 
information and resources. It 
is imperative, however, to uti-
lize these platforms to the best 
of our abilities. This includes 
active interactions with the 
media while trying to edu-
cate yourself and/or others 
about current events and how 
we can move forward. It is 
very easy to be passive when 
dealing 
with 
social 
media 

activism, a term designated 
“slacktivism,” 
which 
can, 

unfortunately, 
block 
access 

to important, helpful infor-
mation. Consider the recent 
event 
of 
#blackouttuesday, 

where millions of Instagram 
users reposted a black square 
with the hashtags #blacklives-
matter, #blm or the afore-
mentioned 
#blackouttuesday.

How COVID-19 exposed America’s failing values

From The Daily: The history of 

policing and the power of protesting
O

n Monday, May 25, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white 
Minneapolis police officer. This incident was a final breaking 
point and has galvanized outrage from communities all over the 

country, sparking protests and calls for justice across the United States. 
The unjust death of Floyd is not an isolated incident by any means, nor 
is it unprecedented, nor should it be a surprise to anyone who has access 
to news and media outlets — this is a tale as old as time, one that has 
happened to an unfathomable number of intersectional Black citizens.

I 
first 
learned 

Espresso Royale was 
closing all of its locations 

in early June, it felt like just another 
thing fighting for my attention. Amid 
the global COVID-19 pandemic and 
Black Lives Matter protests following 
the killings of George Floyd and 
Breonna Taylor — only two examples 
of white supremacy that have sparked 
recent uprisings — the news that 
the coffee chain was closing seemed 
rather insignificant. That’s not to 
say Espresso Royale’s closing, or the 
closing of any business predicted to 
not make it through the pandemic, 
won’t have a real impact for some of 
the 38.1 million Americans employed 
in the service and retail industries hit 
the hardest. Still, Espresso Royale’s 
closing did not seem like the greatest 
cause for concern at the time. 

As I have had more time to reflect 

on the news, I am left with all of my 
memories sitting at Espresso Royale, 
an incredibly important place for me 
and many of my peers throughout 
college. It was where we would study 
on countless mornings, afternoons, 
evenings and late nights; met with 
friends in between classes; went on 
or observed awkward first dates and 
organized to work on group projects. 
Espresso Royale was a reliable study 
spot where you were bound to run into 
people you knew. 

While my peers and I ostensibly 

went to Espresso Royale to study, 
my favorite memories there were 
when we barely got any work done 
at all. You could always count on 
finding someone to talk to when 
you were avoiding homework. As a 
very extroverted person who loves 
to procrastinate, I would often go to 
Espresso Royale between classes, 
even when I had no work to do, just to 

take refuge from the cold and find 

someone to chat with for a couple of 
minutes. While I stared at blank Word 
documents hoping my essay would 
type itself, I got to talk with friends or 
acquaintances about what was new 
in our lives, how we felt about school, 
where we were coming from and 
where we wanted to go. Since Espresso 
Royale was open until 11 p.m., we took 
shelter there for hours on end. 

During my junior year, I found 

myself bewildered by how much time 
my peers and I had spent at Espresso 
Royale’s State Street location, or 
ERSSL as we would commonly 
abbreviate it. It was impossible to 
walk into ERSSL without seeing 
at least three people you knew. 
One night — while I was once 
again procrastinating completing 
my course readings — I took this 
bewilderment online. 

On Feb. 20, 2017, a fellow Michigan 

Daily opinion editor and I started the 
Espresso Royale (State Street) Fan 
Club Facebook Group, an unofficial 
fan page for people — mainly 
myself — to post Espresso Royale 
memes and commentary. The posts 
in our unofficial fan club ranged 
from a variety of topics: jokes about 
Espresso Royale’s renovations or the 
infamous “coffee12” wifi password, 
photos of people drinking Espresso 
Royale in their 8 a.m. class, questions 
about how much to tip for a $2.50 
latte and general posts about the 
Espresso Royale experience. There 
weren’t any rules dictating what was 
appropriate to post, as long as it was 
Espresso 
Royale-related. 
Despite 

the page never gaining more than 
342 members, I reveled in the local 
fandom and small-town popularity 
the group provided me, loving the 
attention I got from strangers who 
grew to know me as “the Espresso 
Royale guy.” 

While it was all just for fun, our 

devotion to Espresso Royale left me 
with the same question that inspired 
me to start the page in the first place: 
Why the hell do we spend so much 
time at this coffee shop? My peers 
and I must have clocked hundreds 
of hours each at ERSSL. Given the 
wide array of coffee shops in Ann 
Arbor, I don’t think it’s controversial 
to say that Espresso Royale was not 
the greatest option in town. This is 
no fault of Espresso Royale. After all, 
how is one to compete with the likes 
of Literati Coffee or Roos Roast?

Still, even without these elite 

alternatives around to serve as points 
of comparison, it’s not as if Espresso 
Royale was trying very hard. The 
coffee, service and seating, albeit 

reliable, were all just okay. One day 
during the summer after I graduated, 
I went into ERSSL with some friends 
to work on job applications only to 
find the A/C was out. This memory 
is representative of many ERSSL 
experiences: Showing up only to find 
something massively uncomfortable, 
yet staying for at least an hour 
anyways. While I would never go on 
the record saying ERSSL was perfect, 
the popular Zucchini bread, strong 
cups of coffee and camaraderie kept 
me coming back. 

With so many other great cafes 

to choose from, why did so many of 
my peers consistently congregate 
at ERSSL? There are certainly 
some pragmatic reasons. Espresso 
Royale’s State Street location was 
relatively 
accessible, 
convenient 

and open late. Espresso Royale’s 
prices were not radically different 
from other options nearby, such as 
Starbucks, but they generally let 
you use their space without buying 
anything. Their openness to letting 
people loiter in addition to the charm 
and $2 Latte Wednesday deal — a 
tradition celebrated like a holiday in 
the Espresso Royale Facebook group 
— made it a sufficient college study 
spot. You could find several friends 
in ERSSL on Wednesday mornings 
even when, to our collective horror, 
the latte deal was raised to $2.50 
Latte Wednesdays.

I am certainly not saying Espresso 

Royale’s storewide policy was to 
let anyone loiter. Although baristas 
tended not to care about people 
loitering, or were just too busy to 
notice, I have still seen Espresso 
Royale staff ask homeless residents to 
leave. The best solution to the lack of 
places to go without spending money 
in a city as unaffordable as Ann Arbor 
— whether to study, see friends or 
simply take refuge from the rain — is 
increased investment in affordable 
housing and public community 
spaces, not private coffee shops. 

P

ast attempts at reform, even 
in Minneapolis, have been 
evidently ineffective and do 

not satisfy community demands. 
Instead of trying to change things 
from within the system — what 
reform sought to do — it is more 
essential to defund and dismantle 
the policing system that has dispro-
portionately targeted and harassed 
Black communities for centuries. 
By divesting and funneling finan-
cial resources away from policing 
agencies, we can instead build and 
invest in municipal programs that 
work to fix the underlying chal-
lenges in communities — such as 
poverty, poor education, inad-
equate housing, food insecurity, 
drug rehabilitation, mental health 
problems, etc. 

There is reasonable confusion 

over the true difference between 
police reform and defunding the 
police, creating subsequent hesi-
tance over the latter. When evalu-
ating your own confusion, it’s 
essential to listen to the voices 
that have been most impacted by 
the continuous overabundance of 
policing and surveillance. Black 
Lives Matter co-founder Alicia 
Garza stated, “When we talk about 
defunding the police, what we’re 
saying is invest in the resources that 
our communities need. So much of 
policing right now is generated and 
directed towards quality-of-life 
issues, homelessness, drug addic-
tion, domestic violence. … But what 
we do need is increased funding 
for housing, we need increased 
funding for education, we need 
increased funding for quality of 
life of communities who are over-
policed 
and 
over-surveilled.” 

When trying to disrupt a system 

that has been maintained through 
different mediums since slavery, we 

must have a mutual understanding 
of what we are hoping to disrupt 
and of what our ultimate end goal 
should look like. Many activists 
have advocated for reforming the 
police departments; others, for a 
defunding model that would strive 
to divest large funds from national 
police departments and equitably 
invest that money into commu-
nity services. However, we have 
seen, with a prime example being 
the Minneapolis Police Depart-
ment, that reforms are not success-
ful. TIME reports that “the same 
reforms were recommended time 
and again over the past two decades 
in the MPD to increase account-
ability, curb use-of-force violations 
and build up community trust — 
with seemingly little implementa-
tion.” A recent movement called 
#8cantwait advocates for banning 
unnecessary measures of vio-
lence, for requiring police officers 
to exhaust all alternatives before 
shooting and intervening and com-
prehensive reporting, among other 
things. Organizers claim this initia-
tive could reduce police use of force 
by 72 percent. However, many activ-
ists are already criticizing this plan, 
calling it “copaganda” and saying it 
will improve policing’s war on the 
Black community, as it does not call 
for the removal of funds from police 
departments and does not address 
the entire issue of systemic racism 
and brutality within the institution. 

Decreasing police budgets is 

the first step in addressing the dis-
proportionate amount of funding 
that police departments receive 
from 
the 
federal 
government. 

Calls for defunding do not mean 
the removal of efforts for pub-
lic safety, but rather a demand 
to stop spending millions of dol-
lars on military-style equipment 

for poorly trained police officers. 

The protests against police bru-

tality and the greater system that 
Americans are witnessing and par-
ticipating in right now are nothing 
new. From many past demonstra-
tions — including the 2014 Fer-
guson protests in Missouri that 
ushered in the Black Lives Matter 
movement to the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots to the 1965 Watts riots — we 
are reminded that the stringent 
acts of racial profiling, oppression 
and violence enacted by police 
officers on the Black community 
is a centuries-old problem. As dis-
cussed in a recent editorial, mod-
ern policing agencies in the U.S. 
originated from slave patrols and 
night watches, which were primar-
ily constituted of white men using 
vigilante tactics to further control 
and oppress Black individuals. 
These groups worked for wealthy 
white slave owners to punish, cap-
ture and return enslaved people 
who escaped or were believed to 
have violated plantation rules. 
These first police forces were over-
whelmingly focused on respond-
ing to, and punishing, what they 
considered disorderly, non-white 
behavior rather than actual crime. 

As American slavery gratingly 

matured into a depraved regime 
that denied Black people human-
ity while still criminalizing their 
actions, they were considered 
capable of engaging in crime but 
“incapable of performing civil acts.” 
Similarly, while the 13th Amend-
ment is credited with ending the 
concept of slavery we are taught 
in grade school, it stopped short of 
ending slavery for those convicted 
of crimes. The laws that once gov-
erned slaves were replaced with 
Black Codes governing free Black 
individuals, soon making the new 

criminal justice system of America 
central to strategic racial control. 

These methods of oppression 

intensified whenever Black people 
asserted their autonomy or achieved 
any degree of success. For example, 
during Reconstruction, white poli-
cymakers and other white people in 
positions of power invented offens-
es used to target Black individuals. 
These included breaking strict cur-
fews only for Black people, loiter-
ing, vagrancy, not carrying proof 
of employment from a former slave 
owner, etc. Those caught for such 
actions were quickly apprehended 
and American slavery persisted in 
the form of convict leasing, where 
Southern states could lease their 
prisoners to large plantations, 
mines and railways — all for profit. 

Later, in the second half of the 

20th century, a new political fear 
would emerge during protests 
over harsh inequalities and civil 
rights. Black and brown people are 
still disproportionately targeted 
by these policies that were not as 
explicitly racialized as the Black 
Codes, although their implemen-
tation has been characteristically 
similar. Former President Richard 
Nixon’s “war on drugs,” “broken 
windows” 
policing, 
mandatory 

minimum sentences, three-strike 
laws, children tried as adults, etc., 
were all implemented. The rhetoric 
of “law and order” and subsequent 
focus on suppressing the Civil 
Rights Movement was adopted as 
a centerpiece for Nixon’s platform, 
which white authorities heavily 
utilized to criminalize Black indi-
viduals fighting for equal rights. As 
“cracking down on crime” became 
a codified tune, no distinction 
was drawn between civil rights 
activists, traditional petty crimes 
and rebellions. Within the past 

weeks, we’ve seen President Don-
ald Trump invoke the same racist 
rhetoric as he declared himself the 
“president of law and order” and 
also quoted a racist 1960s Miami 
police chief by tweeting, “when the 
looting starts, the shooting starts.”

Unfortunately, many prominent 

politicians, including Joe Biden, 
former vice president and pre-
sumptive Democratic presidential 
nominee have not voiced their sup-
port for what Black communities 
across the country are calling for 
and are instead “opposed to cut-
ting police funding and believed 
more spending was necessary to 
help improve law enforcement and 
community policing.” Many activ-
ists advocating against reforms at 
this time are calling for politicians 
to “read the room” and to listen to 
the people. However, many fear 
that instead of taking political risks 
to implement the much needed sys-
tematic changes in this country, 
politicians are more worried about 
alienating moderate white voters. 

For example, in response to an 

uproar of protests against systemic 
racism and police brutality in May 
2015, former President Barack 
Obama and a selected team crafted 
“The Final Report of the Presi-
dent’s Task Force on 21st Century 
Policing.” This report consisted of 
various reform approaches, many 
similar to those of the #8cantwait 
campaign 
circulating 
recently. 

These reforms have made no per-
manent or effective progress and 
local activist groups are continuing 
to reject broader pushes for more 
reform-based training. Johnetta 
Elzie, a civil rights activist and 
organizer, stated, “People in power 
— politicians and policymakers 
— are still talking about reform. 
We’re beyond that. We’re over 

that. If they wanted reform, they 
would have done it six years ago 
when we actually had the chance 
to. But that’s not what happened.” 

Instead, it is time to reimagine 

the ineffective and systemically 
racist notions of policing agen-
cies and their superficial proce-
dural reforms by defunding the 
police and investing in specific, 
community-focused 
safety 
and 

prevention 
programs. 
Produc-

tive steps forward could include 
the installation of multiple com-
munity departments and facilities 
that interactively work with com-
munity residents, to an equitable 
degree. This is suggested in the 
#8toabolition initiative, which was 
initially made by activist group 
Critical Resistance and was then 
reproduced by an ad team that cre-
ated a website providing a variety of 
shareable graphics for social media. 

In Minneapolis specifically, a 

report was published in 2018 that 
outlined all the reforms the police 
department has embraced, includ-
ing body cameras and various train-
ing sessions that cover mindfulness, 
implicit bias and crisis interven-
tion. 
The 
Minneapolis 
Police 

Department also forfeited money 
to training programs and better 
equipment, but there was little to 
no decline in Black fatalities caused 
by law enforcement. With that in 
mind, it is pertinent that a budget 
seeks to resolve the facets of life 
that often incite petty crime such 
as drug abuse, mental and physi-
cal illness, food insecurity, poverty 
and the other impairments that 
disproportionately affect the dis-
advantaged areas of the larger city. 

ALLISON PUJOL | COLUMN

‘When do you think the protests will stop?’

“

When do you think the protests 
will stop?” My mother asked me 
this when we were both sitting 

in the kitchen a few days ago. “Didn’t 
they arrest the cop who killed that 
guy? I don’t understand why there are 
all these violent protests still. And how 
does it benefit anyone to vandalize a 
building?” 

My mother is the daughter of two 

Cuban immigrants. My father is the 
proud son of two Cubans who also 
came to the United States decades ago. 
Many older members of my family, 
including my grandparents, have 
likewise voiced concerns about the 
legitimacy of the protests erupting 
around the country in the aftermath 
of George Floyd’s death. One of my late 
relatives was imprisoned in Cuba for 
more than 20 years for his activities as a 
political activist. I have been wondering 
lately what he would have to say about 
my family’s response, given Cuba’s own 
history of protest. Likewise, political 
activism before and during the 90s 
in Cuba bears notable distinctions 
from the contemporary protests in 
the United States, but there are also 
important parallels. 

When the Soviet Union dissolved 

in 1991, Cuba lost its main trading 
partner as well as the source of 
much of its international political 
support. An economic crisis soon 
unfolded within Cuba, resulting in 
strict rationing, rolling blackouts (for 
up to 20 hours) and severe medicine 
shortages. In 1994, nearly a thousand 
Cubans gathered at Havana’s Malecon 
(a sea wall along the country’s capital 
known for its tourist appeal) to voice 
their frustrations. Protesters broke 
windows and destroyed property as 
others recorded the events unfolding, 
desperate for their voices to be heard. 
The uprising was effectively quelled on 
the same day it started because police 
shot, beat or threatened protesters 
who would not leave the streets. Nobody 
really writes much about this uprising. 
But many Cubans solemnly remember 
it, even if they no longer live on the island. 
Cuban-American communities should 
bear those parallels in mind when 
considering their role and respective 
privilege in the broader context of police 
violence against people of color. 

Despite the destructionist tactics 

used by protestors, the Maleconazo 
riot is a point of pride for many Cubans 
who now reside in the U.S. If my own 
community’s continued willingness to 
speak out against past injustice at the 
hands of Fidel Castro’s military and 
police force is any indication, many 
Cubans who now reside in the United 
States would not be so quick to condemn 
the Maleconazo riot more than 25 
years ago. I struggle to imagine any 
of my grandparents criticizing those 
protestors who vandalized buildings 
in a display of their frustration against 
their country’s deteriorating economic 
conditions. No Cuban-American I 
know speaks out against those who 
stole boats that same year to flee to the 
United States. In some ways, the lack 
of understanding that many Cubans in 
my community have exhibited towards 
those protesting police brutality and the 
United States’ long legacy of systemic 
racism is surprising. In many ways, 
however, this reaction is predictable.

Despite the history of anti-Latino 

sentiment in the United States, 
Latin American communities have 
not always been compassionate or 
responsible partners in the fight 
against racism. Even though people 
of Hispanic descent have been racially 
profiled by police or are increasingly 
the target of hate crimes, racism has 
been deeply internalized in many 
immigrant communities. As Karla 
McKanders, a clinical professor of 
law at Vanderbilt Law School, writes, 
instead of seeing themselves as 
natural allies in the fight for social 
and economic justice, many white 
and white-passing Cuban-Americans 
see themselves in competition with 
Black 
Americans. 
Furthermore, 

George Martinez, a professor of law 
at Southern Methodist University, 
writes that some Latinos “often 
sought to ‘pass’ as white … because 
they thought that becoming white 
insured greater economic, political 
and social security … [which] meant 
gaining access to a whole set of public 
and private privileges, and was a way 
to avoid being the object of others’ 
domination.” Like many privileged 
Cuban-Americans, 
I 
personally 

have been guilty of implicit bias and 

racism — both intentional and not — 
and am still learning how I can most 
effectively dismantle the subtle, yet 
powerful hatred that often exists in 
my own community. 

Whether these comments are 

intended to belittle Black activists 
or not, many of the critiques I have 
heard of the ongoing protests are 
nonetheless reflections of that same 
subtle hatred. Deflecting to concerns 
about property damage belittles the 
real and immeasurable pain that 
police brutality has inflicted upon 
Black 
communities. 
Responding 

to the international outcry over 
the irreplaceable loss of lives with 
reports of damaged vehicles or stores 
suggests that perhaps, in fact, you 
might not think Black lives matter as 
much mass-produced, replaceable 
objects from Target. (As an aside, it 
is never a good sign when a multi-
million dollar corporation’s response 
to looting is more charitable than 
your own). Dismissing these protests 
as “violent” and thus irredeemable 
avoids an important discussion 
about why protests are taking place 
at all and does not consider the larger 
history of protests across the world. 
This response in particular also 
reflects a choice to be ignorant about 
the way the police have responded to 
protests about police brutality with 
more police brutality.

The protests in the United 

States today are not about me or my 
family. I chose to write this article 
because I thought it was necessary 
to use my platform as an opinion 
columnist to purposefully critique 
the response many of my family 
members and members of my 
community have taken toward the 
protests and this country’s history of 
anti-Black racism. The way to begin 
to destruct internalized racism in 
our own homes and communities 
is to acknowledge privilege and 
have conversations about ongoing 
discrimination and injustice, no 
matter how painful or uncomfortable.

From The Daily: Divest to invest — the reality of dismantling the police
O

n Sunday, June 7, nine members of the Minneapolis City Council acknowledged that the current system of policing is not working 
and that they intend to “defund and dismantle” the city police department. Council President Lisa Bender stated, “(We need) to 
listen, especially to our Black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions 

lie in our community.” While still in the process of planning exactly what these new, transformative and community-based initiatives 
may look like, the goal is to implement a model of public safety that actually keeps each community safe. Conversations of defunding 
and dismantling police departments have popped up all over the country, and many are concerned about what exactly this means.

‘Trinkets’: A show made 
perfectly for Twitter

‘I Used to Go Here’ is a 
different campus return

The Michigan Daily’s 
Albums of the Summer

‘The Best Parts of Us’ celebrates our ties to the Earth

It might seem that if a Netflix 

executive wanted to get a grasp 
on what the kids were up to these 
days, all they would have to do 
is log on to Twitter — a pseudo 
soapbox of what new generations 
value and want to see change in 
— and soak it all in. Needless to 
say, Twitter is not the real world, 
but it occupies a very strange 
role in American society. When 
users start asking if crimes like 

shoplifting can be normalized, 
they are (mostly) joking. But 
apparently no one told Netflix 
this, because they took gen-Z 
Twitter quips and ran with it for 
two seasons.

“Trinkets” is just another 

addition 
to 
Netflix’s 
diverse 

catalogue of original coming-
of-age stories. The show centers 
on Elodie (Brianna Hildebrand, 
“Deadpool”), a socially-awkward 
lesbian junior in high school 
and her two girl friends — the 
stubborn, 
loud-mouthed 
Moe 

(Kiana Madeira, “The Flash”) 
and the rich, popular Tabitha 
(Quintessa Swindell, “Euphoria”). 
Each character has their own 
semi-separate subplot revolving 
around love, typical of Netflix 
teen shows. Season two continues 
where the first left off: Moe 
struggles to be the girlfriend her 
lover Noah (Odiseas Georgiadis, 
“Sacred Lies”) wants.

A return to campus is always 

a return to the familiar. We 
see the friends we’ve missed, 
the places we’ve been thinking 
about and the routine we’ve 
been craving. That said, to say 
that this year will be different 
is 
an 
understatement. 
It’s 

difficult right now to imagine 
the normal college experience. 
Imagine what returning to the 
University will feel like in a 
year, or five, or fifteen.

Watching 
“I 
Used 
to 

Go Here” in this context 
was interesting. Kris Rey’s 
(“Unexpected”) 
indie 
flick, 

which 
was 
supposed 
to 

appear at this year’s South 
by Southwest before it got 
canceled, follows struggling 
writer Kate Conklin (Gillian 
Jacobs, “Community”) as she 
returns to her alma mater 
in 
Carbondale, 
IL. 
Kate’s 

crumbling life is immediately 
established — within the first 
few minutes, she talks to her 

publishers about her canceled 
book tour while toting a box 
of invitations to her canceled 
wedding. Going back to her old 
university not only distracts 
her from her failing book sales, 
it draws her back into her 
college days.

It’s 
clear 
that 
Kate’s 

alma mater awakens a deep 
nostalgia — she begins every 
conversation with “I used to,” 
as in “I used to live here,” “I 
used to dance in this room,” 
etc. She reunites with her 
old mentor, creative writing 
instructor David Kirkpatrick 
(Jermaine Clement, “What We 
Do in the Shadows”). She runs 
into old classmates, played 
by Jorma Taccone (“Popstar: 
Never Stop Never Stopping”) 
of The Lonely Island, and Kate 
Micucci (“The Little Hours”) 
in a short but memorable 
cameo. She visits her old house 
where she and her friends 
lived while they were students, 
and eventually befriends the 
kids who live there now. All 
throughout, she gives updates 
to her (very pregnant) friend 

Laura (Zoë Chao, “Love Life”), 
who chats with her about all of 
their old college spots but also 
serves as a reminder: Kate is 
an adult who has been out of 
college for a long time.

With the nostalgia comes 

what I can only describe as a 
regression in behavior. Within 
the first day of returning to 
college, 
Kate 
parties 
with 

the kids who live in her old 
house. Her realignment with 
David 
indicates 
a 
mentor-

mentee 
relationship 
that 

is complicated at best and 
problematic 
at 
worst, 
and 

she finds herself jealous of 
April (Hannah Marks, “Dirk 
Gently’s 
Holistic 
Detective 

Agency”), David’s star student. 
She makes cringeworthy and 
juvenile 
choices, 
because 

something 
about 
a 
college 

campus reignites the impulses 
of her college days. But this is 
apparently what can happen 
when you come back to college.

Sally Cole-Misch dedicates her 

debut novel, “The Best Part Of 
Us,” to “every living thing.” An 
environmental 
communicator 

by profession, Cole-Misch refers 
to more than just humans or 
other animals. Her dedication 
encapsulates the entire natural 
world. Clusters of birch trees, 
steep rocky cliffs, vast lakes and 
bays — Cole-Misch recognizes 
that everything around us is 

living, pulsing, with energies 
unique to its spirit. 

“The Best Part Of Us” is a 

captivating celebration of nature 
that pushes us to consider our 
connections to the Earth. Cole-
Misch tells her story through 
the eyes of Beth Llyndee, an 
adolescent girl who returns to 
her family’s island in the fictional 
Lake Wigwakobi every summer. 
Beth’s summers on her island 
are the most treasured part of 
her childhood, a place where she 
can hike on trails and swim in 

waters she knows by heart. Lake 
Wigwakobi is a part of Beth, 
much more a home than her 
house in Ann Arbor. When Beth’s 
tight bond with nature suddenly 
shatters, she’s forced to choose 
between her family and her 
cherished island refuge. 

Cole-Misch’s strength lies in 

her formation of setting, writing 
about Lake Wigwakobi in an 
evocative and compelling way 
that immediately draws readers 
to the island. Upon first viewing 
of the lake, Beth “leaned over the 

bow to watch the water change 
from aquamarine to indigo as the 
lake deepened, and to brilliant 
white when the bow broke its 
stillness and collected it into 
waves.” 
Similar 
descriptions 

accompany 
everything 
from 

picking blueberries on the island’s 
peak to watching the sky dance 
with northern lights on a summer 
night. “As Beth absorbs her view—
the water, people, trees, rocks, and 
sky—her back lifts, her arms fall 
to her side, and her legs relax to 
cross at her ankles,” Cole Misch 

writes. Her words paint the Earth 
as our ultimate refuge, a source 
of strength to draw from and live 
intimately within.

“The Best Part Of Us” is a 

lighthearted read that shines in 
its simplicity. The novel’s plot 
isn’t exceptionally noteworthy 
or adventurous — the spotlight is 
instead on the natural world. “...
some of us need to step outside 
what man creates and does to one 
another to find peace and clarity in 
the woods, water, and sky,” Cole-
Misch writes. Each character is 

multilayered and built beautifully 
to show how variable human 
relationships to the environment 
can be. Beth thinks clearly 
when sitting on the forest floor 
surrounded by pine needles, while 
her mother thinks only of the 
island’s dangerous cliffs posing a 
threat to her family’s safety.

Phoebe Bridgers, Punisher
Phoebe Bridgers is the master 

of emotive storytelling. She didn’t 
reinvent or revolutionize the art of 
it though, and she’s not pretending 
that she has. “I think I’m pulling 
from a lot of different places, 
stealing from a lot of different 
people,” she said in an interview 
with NPR. 

Most 
overtly, 
she 
“steals” 

from idol Elliott Smith, his name 
all but mentioned on title track 
“Punisher.” Here, she details 
her self-proclaimed “obsession” 
for Smith and addresses the 
song directly to him, using his 
conventions. The opening lines, 
the chorus, her signature double 
tracking and detailed storytelling 
all hark back to his work. But 
Smith isn’t the only clear influence 
here— frequent collaborator and 
bandmate Conor Oberst has his 
share on the lyrics, and the pops 
of baroque instrumentation are 
reminiscent of Illinois-era Sufjan 
Stevens. 

However, Punisher isn’t about 

Bridgers’s obsessions and idols so 
much as it’s an honest exploration 
of where she finds inspiration 
for her music. Oftentimes, her 
lyrics read like quiet ruminations, 
unfurling 
to 
reveal 
intimate 

details that grapple with personal 
and interpersonal relationships 
at their most unsettling. Bridgers 
thumbtacks specific moments, 
ideations and people that have 

impacted her and, in many ways, 
haunted her on this album. 
The lyrics get so intimate and 
vulnerable that they sometimes 
feel as though they shouldn’t 
make sense to anyone outside of 
that experience. There’s a moment 
on “Garden Song” I revisit often 
that goes: “The doctor put her 
hands over my liver / She told me 
my resentment’s getting smaller.” 
Lines like this have connotations 
that are poignant enough to stick 
around long after the song is 
over. Bridgers balances the very 
personal, sometimes emotionally 
scarring details of her lyrics with 
her soft, dreamy instrumentation 
and her gentle voice. 

I’ve spent nearly every day of 

summer in private conversation 
with Phoebe Bridgers’s Punisher. 
So much so, it soundtracks 
many memories for me. It’s not 
that complicated: The future is 
indecipherable most days, so, 
much like the album, my mind 
retreats to more private moments 
of the past.

Taylor Swift, folklore
As a shameless Swiftie, folklore 

was the answer to my summer 
music prayers. It wasn’t just 
because one of my favorite artists 
had released an album I didn’t 
see coming, it was also because it 
arrived just when I needed it the 
most. A few days after its release, 
I ended a long-term relationship 
and wore “Cardigan” like a warm 

blanket for the following weeks. 
Its imaginative, love-sick mood 
comforted me and reminded me of 
why young love is such a powerful 
thing. And that’s what Taylor does 
best — she romanticizes love in a 
way that makes us feel nostalgic 
for lost relationships and missed 
chances, even if we’ve never 
experienced them first-hand. 

Many critics say that folklore 

sounds a lot like Swift’s older 
music, but I have to disagree. 
While I can certainly see where 
they’re coming from — folklore is 
more tame than Swift’s previous 
releases Reputation and Lover — 
the album possesses an organic 
sound that we’ve never seen in 
Taylor’s work before. In a moment 
when the world is overwhelmed 
by all of the bad things going on, 
it’s nice to sit with Taylor’s soft 
acoustic songs and take a moment 
just to dream. folklore is a dreamy 
ode to love, filled with allusions to 
fairy tales and stories Swift came 
up with herself for the album. 

Perhaps the most striking part 

of folklore is that Taylor created 
the album from start to finish all 
while in isolation. The fact that she 
was able to write an entire album, 
record it, and then market it with 
a killer music video is impressive, 
but this project is also a sign of 
hope during these troubling times. 
Even while we’re apart from the 
people we love and longing for 
life to return to some form of 
normalcy, folklore reminds us that 
there’s still a space to create and 
dream.

Music has been a crutch for 

everyone during 2020. For a lot 
of us, we went back and listened 
to music from our childhood or 
adolescent years, or even dove 
head first into new types of music. 
This year has been rough for 
the music industry in countless, 
unimaginable ways. Inevitably, 
music 
persists, 
adapting 
to 

change. Taylor Swift has tapped 
into and thrived off of this change, 
capturing this summer of solitude 
with folklore.

Swift never fails to surprise 

the world with her various eras, 
ever-changing from album to 
album. 2019’s Lover was both a 
fan favorite as well as a critical 
success. It was arguably Swift’s 
most masterful look into the 
beauty of love, which many know 
was inspired by her long term 
partner, Joe Alwyn.

folklore was a bigger Swift 

surprise 
than 
usual, 
to 
say 

the least. One of the biggest 
departures from her last two 
albums, reputation and Lover, 
folklore is everything Taylor Swift 
hadn’t done yet. The album is 
simple and digestible. It has some 
of Swift’s most powerful lyrics and 
showcases her wildly impressive 
vocal range. The understated 
aesthetic of the album, from the 
simple cover to the lowercase 
stylization of the song titles, 
makes the beauty of each song 
stand out more. Swift has taken 
a step back from the spotlight on 
this album, leaving each song to 

speak for itself without any of the 
drama or glitz of her 2017 and 2019 
releases. 

The album itself is raw, but 

it really came out at the perfect 
time. A breakup-esque, escapist 
album in the middle of a pandemic 
is something the world needed. 
Who better to get it from than 
Swift, the girl who writes about 
love and heartbreak better than 
anyone else?

Deerhoof, Future Teenage 

Cave Artists

If there was any band that could 

pull off a concept album about the 
youth population living through 
an absurdist’s post-apocalyptic 
world, it would be Deerhoof. 
The experimental rock group 
hailing from San Francisco has 
been going on for more than two 
decades at this point, and they 
aren’t getting any easier to define 
stylistically. With Future Teenage 
Cave Artists, they moved towards 
a more narrative approach.

The 
brilliant 
songwriting 

and texture play is what really 
allows the concept to come alive. 
The atmosphere can only be 
described as a cross between an 
“Adventure Time” episode on 
acid and a Hieronymus Bosch 
hellscape. The guitar tones, of 
which there are numerous across 
the album, vary from downright 
face-melting 
to 
grotesquely 

playful. The drums are played in 
such a drunken haphazardness 

that it leaves the listener either 
in awe of the talent or concerned 
for the drummer’s wellbeing. Add 
the iconic high pitched singing of 
Satomi Matsuzaki and what’s left 
is a final product that both excites 
and unnerves.

Perhaps the best part about 

Future Teenage Cave Artists is 
that it isn’t reliant on its narrative 
to be great. While it’s true that 
the stylistic choices they made 
create a world, it isn’t totally 
obvious at first what that world 
is. The greatest indicator might 
be the title itself. After several 
listens, it slowly becomes more 
clear what the band is trying to 
communicate. As amazing as 
Deerhoof is at building a dystopian 
world that blurs the line between 
fun and nightmarish, they are just 
as great at crafting a collection 
of absurd rock and pop bangers. 
Honestly, there might not be a 
better summer for it.

In

Not 
a 
month 
before 

quarantine started, my Taylor 
Swift™ snake ring snapped in 
half. After anxiously twisting it 
on and off my finger for nearly 
two years, the silvery metal 
fittingly relented in therapy. 
Bulky, obnoxious and glittery 
green — I had come to think 
of it as a secret signal (“I knew 
you were a Swiftie!”) and a 
conversation starter. “Oh,” I 
began when anyone asked me 
about it, “I’m a really big Taylor 
Swift fan.”

So it’s hard to overstate the 

unconscionable joy and sheer 
terror I felt Thursday morning 
when I saw that Taylor’s eighth 
album, 
folklore, 
was 
going 

to be released in less than 24 
hours. Pre-album release rituals 
out the window (listen to all 
previous albums in consecutive 
order, wear all possible Taylor 
merch during release week, etc., 
etc.), all I could do was take a 
few selfies with the sepia-toned 
folklore™ filter on Instagram — 
and wait. 

To 
anyone 
well-versed 

in 
Taylor’s 
meticulous 

release routine, folklore is an 
interruption. Her lead singles 
are expected to roll out three to 
four months in advance of each 
new album, which are released 
every two years in autumn, and 

followed by a year-and-a-half 
long tour. Right on schedule, 
if it wasn’t for COVID-19, I 
would have been preparing to 
attend LoverFest this week, 
the accompanying festival to 
Taylor’s 2019 effort. 

But more explicitly, folklore 

is an interruption full stop. 
The pastel palette of Lover 
has been washed over with 
a 
melancholy 
gray. 
Sugary 

anthemic pop replaced with 
atmospheric 
strings, 
piano 

and acoustic guitar. Taylor has 
always been a poet, but with a 
subdued backdrop her lyrics 
have room to shine. While I’m 
not sure that one of the biggest 
pop stars in the world can, by 
definition, create something 

“alternative” or “indie,” folklore 
is certainly the closest Taylor’s 
ever come. With the help of The 
National member, songwriter 
and producer Aaron Dessner, 
and longtime collaborator Jack 
Antonoff, every song on folklore 
sounds like it could be made 
into a movie. The drama of love 
and loss is Taylor’s wheelhouse, 
but she’s never addressed these 
same themes with this kind of 
weight or maturity. 

Take “my tears ricochet” for 

example. Any Swiftie worth 
their salt knows the significance 
that its placement as “track five” 
holds — the fifth track of any 
Taylor album is its emotional 
compass. From her self-titled 
debut to 1989, they were the Big 

Heartbreak Songs. reputation 
broke the mold with the hopeful 
“Delicate,” clueing fans in on 
the fact that she and her current 
boyfriend were in it for the 
long-haul. And on Lover, “The 
Archer” gives insight to Taylor’s 
struggle with loving herself. 
This time around, track five 
invites the listener to a funeral. 
Potentially Taylor’s. 

“I didn’t have it in myself 

to go with grace” she admits, 
backed by ghoulish “oohs” and a 
gloomy keyboard, “ ‘cause when 
I’d fight you used to tell me I 
was brave.” 

‘Folklore’ and intimate isolation

Review: ‘How 
I’m Feeling Now’

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

This piece is a part of a 

series on “Art during COVID,” 
an exploration of art forms to 
keep our idle minds creative 
during this pandemic. With 
many of us at home, our minds 
have ample time to wander, 
wonder and create. This series 
highlights 
accessible 
and 

immersive art forms to both 
produce and consume during 
the pandemic months and 
beyond.

Summer graciously lends 

us picturesque lazy evenings, 
and I use them to create art. 
Sitting on my deck with a 
packet of oil pastels, or on 
my driveway with a palette 
of watercolors, is my way 
of winding down against 
the background of a warm 
summer twilight.

I usually let my mind 

wander as I create, and 
recently I’ve been thinking 
about what exactly art is. 
Even dictionary definitions 
are ambiguous, and rightfully 
so: How can you define 
something that encompasses 
such 
a 
diverse 
range 
of 

personal expression? If I had 
to define it, I would settle for 

“a form of expression that 
holds meaning to the creator 
and the viewer.” Under that 
label, the Black Lives Matter 
protests I’ve been attending 
fit squarely under the art 
umbrella.

I attended two protests last 

week, one in my hometown 
of Canton and the other in 
neighboring 
Northville, 

towns that are 69.6 percent 
and 
95.2 
percent 
white 

respectively, 
according 
to 

the 
U.S. 
Census 
Bureau. 

Despite their proximity to 
each other, both protests 
were different — I marched 
with a diverse crowd in 
Canton, but stared out into 
a sea of white in Northville. 
Regardless of demographics, 
in each protest I felt a pull to 
those I walked with — a sense 
of solidarity, as if the world 
was crumbling but we were 
creating something beautiful 
out of the ashes. 

Protests can be a form 

of communal art, often the 
most powerful of art forms. 
Community-oriented 
types 

of art, such as collaborative 
murals 
or 
community 

dialogues, can be a poignant 
way to create bonds within 
a 
neighborhood, 
and 
its 

message is heard with more 
vigor than art created by one 
person. Everyone has a piece 
to add, a role to play, a story to 
tell. I love the conversations 
that arise when I create art 
with a friend or loved one 
sitting by my side. It seems 
natural 
to 
share 
such 
a 

gratifying experience with 
another person.

Protests 
are 
making 

national headlines in part 
because of the sheer number 
of people turning out and 
the 
enormous 
geographic 

range they cover. I’ve lived 
in the suburbs of metro-
Detroit all of my pre-college 
life, and I’ve never seen 
protests like these before in 
my own hometown. I feel an 
undeniable connection with 
the strangers I march side 
by side with, even though I 
know next to nothing about 
them. Linked by invisible 
threads, 
protesters 
create 

a 
visible 
movement, 
a 

passionate piece of art that is 
now receiving international 
recognition. This intangible 
art 
can 
be 
turned 
into 

something concrete as well, 
such as the wall of protest art 
now surrounding the White 
House, but the intangible is 

just as valuable.

Activism 
isn’t 
unknown 

territory for me. I was raised 
by 
a 
family 
of 
political 

activists, 
and 
I’ve 
been 

campaigning 
for 
political 

causes around my hometown 
before I was old enough to 
vote. But today’s Black Lives 
Matter 
movement 
feels 

different to me. Half of my 
battle is getting someone to 
listen and be agitated enough 
to care about topics close 
to my heart, like voting or 
the environment. I struggle 
every November to get my 
friends to the polls, and many 
of my attempts to engage 
my friends politically end in 
frustration. Now, I finally feel 
the tide turning. We’re angry, 
but eager to channel this 
exasperation 
into 
change. 

The art of protesting allows 
us to express this frustration, 
and each local march adds 
to the larger, international, 
illustration. 
There’s 
still 

mountains of work ahead of 
us, but, as I see open ears and 
accepting hearts around me, 
in my mind a small part of the 
battle is already won.

COVID-19 
has 
given 
the 

phrase “bedroom pop” a whole 
new 
meaning. 
High 
profile 

musicians across the world have 
flocked to video conferencing 
and streaming platforms like 
Zoom and Instagram Live to 
perform and chat with fans more 
than ever before, often from 
the comfort of their bedrooms. 
British singer and experimental-
pop superstar Charli XCX took 
this ascending intimacy between 
artist and listener and cranked 
it up to the max. Her new record 
how i’m feeling now was recorded 
and produced at lightspeed — all 
from scratch over the course of a 
month — and Charli documented 
the process live all along the way. 
Fans were able to tune in as she 
wrote lyrics, filmed music videos 
and collaborated with pop music’s 
most 
cutting-edge 
producers, 

providing an intimate look into 
the synthesis of an electropop 
gem.

The project began on April 6 

when Charli announced it on a 
Zoom call. She simply said she 
was starting a new album from 
scratch, promised to open up the 
creative process to her fans and 

set a release date just over a month 
away. And thus Charli and her fans 
embarked on a grand pop music 
experiment, every day between 
announcement and release being 
a part of the journey to how i’m 
feeling now. Charli modeled 
in “photoshoots” (pictures her 
boyfriend took on his phone in 
their bedroom) that were shared 
with and edited by countless 
artists to make alternate covers 
for each new single, ranging from 
professionally designed album 
covers to humble fanart. She 
live streamed with an eclectic 
bunch of musicians, celebrities 
and public figures including 
Paris Hilton and 100 gecs. And 
maybe most impressively, Charli 
stuck to the arbitrarily imminent 
finish line she set for herself: The 
polished, full-length LP released 
without delay on May 15.

Making 
how 
i’m 
feeling 

now was not just a cute idea 
or an experiment — it was an 
unbelievable success. The final 
album is a weirdly 21st-century 
product 
of 
a 
pandemic, 
an 

unbelievably relevant concoction 
and nothing short of brilliant.

It’s said every theatre is 

inhabited 
by 
at 
least 
one 

ghost, and contrary to legends 
propagated 
by 
Halloween, 

these ghosts do not like the 
dark. Thus, when the curtain 
falls and a theatre’s house 
empties, an employee will leave 
a light — a ghost light — to burn 
onstage until the performers 
return. Across the world, ghost 
lights have remained on and 
untouched for months. But the 
lives of performers continue 
offstage, 
each 
day 
adding 

pressure to find performance 
spaces on digital platforms. 
What 
happens 
when 
the 

ghost lights keep burning and 
we’re left with a stage wholly 
mediated 
by 
posts, 
shares, 

comments and likes? 

In 
late 
May, 
superstar 

ballerina Maria Kochetkova 
posted a ghostly photo of the 
Berliner 
Ensemble 
theatre 

on her Instagram: An aerial 
shot of what was supposed 
to be the audience’s thicket 
of red velvet seats was now 
an 
otherworldly 
scene 
of 

deforestation. 
Every 
third 

or 
fourth 
seat 
had 
been 

unbolted and ripped from 
the ground, leaving socially 
distant pods of one and two-
seat arrangements scattered 
across the floor. The photo 
was originally posted on the 
Berliner’s Instagram account 
with a caption that translated 
to “the new normal,” but 
Kochetkova’s thoughts proved 
more striking: “Why are the 
theaters forced to do this,” she 
wrote, “and not the airlines?” 

The 
controversy 
began 

immediately: Some praised 
Kochetkova 
for 
making 
a 

political 
statement, 
others 

accused her of advocating for 
the violation of health codes. 
In reality, her question fell 
into neither category and the 
curiosity was well-founded. 
Like in theatres, airplane 
passengers sit in seats next 
to each other, wrestling over 
elbow room and breathing 
each other’s exhales.

In April 2016, author, historian 

and professor Ibram X. Kendi 
published 
his 
National 
Book 

Award-winning “Stamped from 
the 
Beginning.” 
In 
what 
he 

subtitles “The Definitive History 
of Racist Ideas in America,” Kendi’s 
exhaustive research chronicles the 
timeline of anti-Black racist ideas 
and their shifting power throughout 
American history. 

Kendi, one of America’s leading 

antiracist voices, was the youngest-
ever winner of the National Book 
Award for Nonfiction in 2016. 
The same year, Jason Reynolds’s 
“Ghost” was nominated for the 
National Book Award in Young 
People’s Literature. This prestigious 
celebration of the best literature in 
America is where the two men met.

But, it wasn’t until March of this 

year, nearly four years later, that 
“Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and 
You” was released — the remix of 
Kendi’s original book, reimagined 
by Reynolds. In an interview with 
“CBS This Morning,” Reynolds 
reveals that he initially declined 
Kendi’s request to write the remix: 
“I said no because I’m careful about 
tampering with things that I believe 
are sacred.” Yet, he finally agreed 

when he realized “this work was 
bigger than the both of us, and it’s 
not about either one of us.” 

Reynolds’s 
remix 
is 
geared 

toward a younger audience, readers 
12 and up. While Kendi is a scholar 
who holds a position as the Director 
of the Antiracist Research & Policy 
Center at American University, 
where he is a professor of history 
and 
international 
relations, 

Reynolds is a writer of books and 
poetry for young adults and middle-
grade audiences. On his website, 
Reynolds declares that he plans to 
“not write boring books.” He goes 
on to say that “I know there are a lot 
of young people who hate reading… 
but they don’t actually hate books, 
they hate boredom” — which is one 
of the initial obstacles he faced with 
the remix. 

So Reynolds, who has said that 

young people don’t like to read 
history books, decided that his 
remix wasn’t a history book, “but 
a book about the present: here and 
now.” 

Like Kendi’s original version, 

Reynolds structures the book using 
five historical figures: Puritan 
minister 
Cotton 
Mather 
from 

the 17th century, founding father 
Thomas 
Jefferson, 
abolitionist 

William Lloyd Garrison, writer 
and activist W. E. B. Du Bois and 
radical activist and writer Angela 
Davis. The division of the book 

into five sections coincides with 
the five guides, spanning from the 
1400s to modern day. While that 
encompasses over 600 years of 
history, Reynolds’s remix caps at 
248 pages, half of Kendi’s 500-page 
original. 

Another important similarity 

in the remix is the three different 
definitions used to identify and 
describe 
the 
people 
explored: 

segregationists, assimilationists and 
antiracists. These three categories 
are repeated frequently throughout 
the book, helping us to understand 
the historical figures represented 
along with their motives and beliefs 
(which we often discover to be 
contradictory). 

Reynolds 
simplifies 
the 

definitions to help young readers 
grasp 
the 
complex 
material, 

calling 
segregationists 
“haters,” 

assimilationists as “the people who 
like you, but only with quotation 
marks” and antiracists as “the 
people who love you because you’re 
like you.” Later, when discussing 
figures like Abraham Lincoln, it was 
helpful to have these definitions as 
we approached his contradictory 
views — like that he wanted slavery 
gone, but didn’t think Black people 
should 
necessarily 
have 
equal 

rights: an assimilationist.

Review: ‘Stamped: Racism, 
Anti-Racism and You’

KALAMAZOO PUBLIC LIBRARY

LILLY PEARCE
Daily Arts Writer

On Dec. 13, 1963, Bob Dylan 

was given the “Tom Paine 
Award” by the Emergency Civil 
Liberties Committee for his 
political 
activism. 
A 
visibly 

shaken, and likely drunk, Dylan 
said he accepted the award on 
behalf of “everybody that went 
down to Cuba,” then unleashed 
a doozy: “I got to admit that 
the man who shot President 
Kennedy, Lee Oswald … I saw 
some of myself in him.” The 
crowd booed him off the stage. 

A 
few 
days 
later, 
Dylan 

released a statement that read, 
in part, “If there’s violence in 
the times, then there must be 
violence in me.” 

*
It’s 2020, and the times are 

more violent than ever. They have 
been for a while. Where has Bob 
Dylan been in the era of Donald 
Trump, mass shootings, climate 
crisis and COVID-19? Where’s 
the singer who marched on 
Washington with Martin Luther 
King Jr. and wrote searing 
political 
anthems 
like 
“The 

Times They Are a-Changin’,” 
“The Lonesome Death of Hattie 
Carroll” and “Only a Pawn in 
Their Game?” He was releasing 
Sinatra cover albums — three, 
to be exact — from 2015-2017. It 

seemed, for those who hoped for 
a guiding message from rock’s 
poet laureate, that Dylan had 
decided to sit this one out. 

Yet, in June 2020, Bob Dylan 

is back with his first album of 
original music in almost a decade 
— Rough and Rowdy Ways. It’s a 
career-defining masterpiece, an 
album both bracingly current 
yet timeless in its compositional 
breadth, pulling from the best 
of Dylan’s work through the 
decades. Rough and Rowdy Ways 
has the enthralling auditory grit 
of 1997’s Grammy-winning Time 
Out of Mind, the socio-political 
layers of Highway 61 Revisited 
and the personal revelations of 
Blood on the Tracks. 

“Today and tomorrow, and 

yesterday too,” Dylan begins the 
album’s first song, “I Contain 
Multitudes.” “The flowers are 
dyin’, like all things do.” Dylan’s 
message is clear from the start: 
These are the end times. Yet after 
this apocalyptic pronouncement, 
he implores an unnamed woman 
to “Follow me close … I’ll lose 
my mind if you don’t come with 
me.” In Dylan’s world, where 
“Everything’s flowing, all at the 
same time,” one can “sleep with 
life and death in the same bed.” 
Basically, even if everyone’s 
going to die, they don’t have to 
die alone.

In 
a 
whimsical, 
almost 

snide cadence, Dylan throws 
in a myriad of other personal 
complexities, but one line stands 

out: “I’m just like Anne Frank, 
like Indiana Jones and them 
British bad boys the Rolling 
Stones.” The lyric bristles at 
the ear, mainly because it’s 
so impenetrable. How is the 
79-year-old Dylan, while a rock 
star like the Rolling Stones, like 
Anne Frank or Indiana Jones? 

Right from the start, Rough 

and Rowdy Ways is sonically 
striking. Dylan’s last original 
album, 2012’s Tempest, was 
chock-full of crashing drums, 
out-of-control guitars and a 
voice that sounded like Dylan 
had swallowed a gallon of rocks. 
Dylan has self-produced every 
one of his albums since 1997, 
and generally favors a raw, 
unfiltered performance by both 
himself and his tour band. This 
time, though, he’s meticulously 
crafted every aspect of the 
album. The instrumentation and 
his voice transform to reflect the 
subject matter of each song. “I 
Contain Multitudes” is almost 
completely acoustic, intimately 
shading the confessional lyrics 
as the listener is drawn in by 
Dylan’s soft voice. 

This comfort is ripped away 

on the second track, “False 
Prophet.” Amid crashing drums 
and 
smarmy 
guitar, 
Dylan 

continues the dark lamentations 
in a Tempest-style bark — “I 
know how it happened, I saw it 
begin. I opened my heart to the 
world, and the world caved in.” 
While he doesn’t yet reveal what 

caused this apocalypse, Dylan 
asserts with haggard surety “I’m 
no false prophet, I just know 
what I know.”

Things get weirder in “My 

Own Version of You,” a song 
backed by a mournful steel guitar 
straight out of a retro horror 
flick. Dylan details his plan to 
dig up “limbs and livers and 
brains and hearts” and “bring 
someone to life … someone who 
feels the way that I feel.” Again, 
love and death are bedmates. 
While Dylan, parroting Victor 
Frankenstein, swears to act 
with “decency and common 
sense … for the benefit of all 
mankind” with his creation, he 
also asks “What would Julius 
Caesar do?” Like Caesar, and all 
authoritarians, Dylan considers 
his actions, however inhumane, 
permissible since he believes 
himself to be working for the 
common good. Adding to this 
prescient commentary, Dylan 

invites the listener to “Step right 
into the burning hell, where 
some of the best-known enemies 
of mankind dwell.” 

In 
these 
flames, 
Dylan 

somehow finds a way to sing a 
masterful love song, “I’ve Made 
Up My Mind to Give Myself to 
You.” 

“I’m sitting on my terrace, 

lost in the stars,” he begins. 
The Sinatra phase has paid 
off 
— 
Dylan’s 
voice 
hasn’t 

sounded this sharp in decades, 
a cavernous croon that soars 
with genuine affection. The 
soft instrumentation builds to 
a sublime electric guitar solo 
that’s one of the best moments 
on the album. There are also 
faint, 
almost 
imperceptible 

backing singers, one of which 
just might be Fiona Apple, whose 
soft choral drone gives the song a 
sense of deep melancholy. When 
Dylan sings, almost tearfully, “I 
don’t think I could bear to live 

my life alone,” it’s as moving as 
anything from his love-sick opus 
Blood on the Tracks. Thankfully 
Dylan meets someone, telling 
this unnamed lover “I’ll lay down 
beside you when everyone’s 
gone.” In a time when reality 
itself seems to be falling apart, 
Dylan’s honesty is piercing. 

Then comes “Black Rider.” To 

the tune of a slithering acoustic 
guitar, 
Dylan 
criticizes 
an 

unnamed man for womanizing, 
violence and arrogance (all of 
which Dylan has displayed thus 
far in the album, making one 
wonder if the song is a soliloquy, 
critiquing 
Dylan’s 
own 
dark, 

masculine shades). Whoever the 
black rider is, Dylan tells the guy 
“You’ve been on the job too long,” 
before giving one the album’s most 
brutal, unexpected lines.

Pop culture would have us 

believe that the Venn diagram 
between sports fans and art nerds 
is more or less two separate circles. 
As a humble representative of the 
tiny sliver in the middle, I want to 
introduce my friends on both sides 
to the world of their culturally 
prescribed adversary. There are 
some similarities between the 
two that few would expect to 
find — similarities that, I argue, 
allow us to view sport as art. Let’s 
set the scene. Our protagonist 
is NFL analyst Adam Schefter, 
who stakes his reputation on his 
straight-shooter, 
no-nonsense 

reporting. Schefter’s Twitter feed 
is the Associated Press of the NFL 
world; if he says something, it’s 
true. A few weeks ago, Schefter 
put on his best suit, set up his 
webcam in front of his well-
stocked bookcase, and joined an 
ESPN broadcast held over Zoom, 
complete with all the aggressive 
rock music, flashy graphics and 
artificial urgency we’ve come to 
expect from the network. The 
occasion? The announcement of 
the order in which next season’s 
NFL games will be played in.

One might think the order of 

games isn’t particularly interesting 
news, perhaps worthy of a short 
segment highlighting interesting 
matchups, but ESPN had other 
thoughts. They instead hosted a 
three-hour show breaking down 
each team’s schedule with such 
pressing commentary as “X team 
won’t be able to handle so many 
games in cold cities in December,” 
or, “Y rookie quarterback will be 
demoralized by difficult opponents 
early on.” This was stated with a 
baffling level of confidence, despite 
being months away from a season 
whose fate is already uncertain 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Meanwhile, Schefter desperately 
tries to do the impossible and fill 
the home stretch of this painfully 
long production with anything 
resembling objective analysis.

How did Schefter find himself 

in this position? The ESPN show 
is an extreme example of the 
increasing role of narrative in 
professional sports. A three-hour 
show for a schedule release is a bit 
excessive, but the stories that the 
media constructs around games 
are a large part of what makes 
them so exciting. Each NFL team 
plays 16 regular-season games. 
Though the average broadcast is 
over three hours long, the ball is 
only in play for about 11 minutes 
per game. To make these short 
bursts of action feel consequential, 
the media sets up elaborate 
storylines in the hours and days 
leading up to games. They do so by 
creating characters out of athletes 
and framing games such that 
they follow a traditional narrative 
arc, putting their characters in 
situations where they have to 
overcome obstacles larger than 
the game itself. The week one 
matchup between the Saints and 
the Buccaneers, for instance, 
becomes not just a potentially 
good game, but a battle between 
veterans Drew Brees and Tom 
Brady to solidify their legacy as 
the best quarterback in the league 
and to push the limits of how many 
years they can play at a high level. 
Analysts will routinely praise the 
determination and perseverance 
required of Brees and Brady to play 
through their 40s. 

Each play thus carries far 

more weight, as it’s not just 
the game on the line, but also a 
whole host of abstract values and 
principles. In this light, analysts 
can 
be 
considered 
analogous 

to storytellers — more so than 
regular journalists, as they add 
far more narrative to their subject 
matter than a reporter covering 
a “real” news story. That is to 
say, the difference between the 
actual events and their portrayal 
in the media is greater in sports 
journalism than it is in other 
branches of journalism. Athletes 
are, in a sense, analogous to 
performers, coaches to directors, 
referees to stage managers and 
so on. The result is a coherent 
“show” so to speak, a circular 
system consisting of the game 
and the media’s commentary 
about the game. The tendency to 

narrativize games can be found in 
other sports, but the NFL and its 
media apparatus have used these 
techniques the most. It pays off for 
them too. The NFL has for some 
time been the most watched sports 
league in the United States. One 
might argue that this phenomenon 
is just a way to sensationalize 
the game and increase profits. 
Though I’m inclined to agree, 
the narrativization of sport has 
nonetheless created the conditions 
by which sport can — and I think 
should — be considered art.

Coinciding with the rise of 

narrativized sport, we’ve seen 
athletes and sports journalists 
broaden the scope of the issues that 
they’re willing to discuss. Whereas 
sports media in the past generally 
had a narrow focus on the sport 
itself (e.g. play-by-play recaps, 
statistics, 
trade 
and 
contract 

negotiations, etc.), it now doesn’t 
shy away players’ personalities, 
drama and even broader social 
issues that don’t directly relate to 
sports. This is mostly an organic 
process, without any motivation 
outside 
of 
generating 
more 

content for its own sake. People 
in sports media are probably not 
intentionally making sport like 
art, and if they are, it is only for 
the practical concern of making 
games more entertaining. There 
are, however, real stakes to these 
conversations.

Sports media, especially NFL 

media, often uses rhetoric that 
praises 
athletes’ 
toughness, 

determination, 
grit 
and 

other similar attributes. This 
traditionally masculine rhetoric 
is often channelled to destructive 
ends. 
Athletes’ 
toughness 
is 

used to justify and downplay the 
serious health risks associated 
with playing a contact sport like 
football. Countless football players 
have suffered from CTE, and 
though the NFL has made some 
small gestures to player safety, 
the 
problem 
remains 
largely 

unaddressed. Violence by athletes 
is routinely swept under the rug.

A 

common misconception about 
“coming out” is that it represents 
a clean break, where there is a de-

finitive moment when you’re in the closet 
and when you’re fully out in public. Most 
queer people will tell you that coming out is 
instead something you have to do over and 
over — that the people you will meet will 
most likely assume you’re straight until you 
inform them otherwise. 

This conception of coming out might be 

more true for trans people, especially trans 
women, than anyone else: It’s hard to avoid 
being “read” as trans. Even if I wanted to 
go “stealth” — that is, to pass as a cisgen-
der woman 100% of the time — I probably 
couldn’t. Too much about me gives me away: 
my broad shoulders, my deep voice, the fa-
cial hair that’s difficult to hide without gau-
dy amounts of makeup. 

Transition is a slower, more tentative pro-

cess than a lot of people think it is. I experi-
mented for about a year with all sorts of vari-
ants on my name, pronouns and dress; even 
when I had pretty firmly decided on formal 
transition, I only told a few people about it 
at first. I wasn’t able to get on hormone re-
placement therapy and pursue electrolysis 
until nearly a year after that. For a long time, 
I was called “sir” by service workers, and 
acquaintances and friends of friends mostly 
called me by my deadname. 

There are a lot of potential stories I could 

extract from this process, but it mostly feels 
amorphous and tentative, even now. I’m 
still unsure what being trans is supposed to 
“mean.” A friend once asked me how I knew 
that I wanted to be a woman, and I wasn’t sure 
how to answer, or if I even had a good answer 
at all. 

Even if I can’t speak to what it might mean 

to be a woman in some metaphysical way, I 
can speak more confidently about being treat-
ed differently as a woman. A few months af-
ter starting hormones, I was walking home at 
about 2 a.m. from a party, and a man caught 
up to me. He walked alongside me for a block 
or so, asking if I would just stop to, “have a 
conversation.” He wanted to know if he could, 
“ask me a question.” I was kind of tipsy and 
kept demurring without saying very much, 
trying to make it clear from my body language 
that I wanted him to leave me alone. He even-
tually did. 

I had never experienced anything remotely 

like that, and while it wasn’t earth-shattering, 
something changed for me after. I’ve only had 
a small handful of things like this happen to 
me since then, but I still noticed that I felt 
a little less safe in public, and started to feel 
more nervous about walking somewhere on 
my own.

This is normal, probably; it is the sort of 

harassment cis women are privy to and have 
experienced for much longer than I have. 
But I know that among trans women, I’m not 
even remotely the worst off. My parents didn’t 
reject me, I didn’t lose my job and I live in a 
place that is relatively accepting of people like 

me. I’m reminded of this every day when I 
log onto Twitter and see people crowdfund-
ing transition expenses, food, housing and 
emergency medical care. Though I see the 
names of murdered trans women proliferate 
on social media, it seems like most cis people 
are generally unaware of how many of us find 
ourselves in sudden need of help, how often 
we find ourselves shut out of society. It seems 
like most people don’t know how precarious 
our lives are. 

The way trans people are talked about in 

public might give you a different idea. The 
amount of discourse around the issue of our 
existence in the media seems grotesquely out 
of proportion given that trans people amount 
to less than 1% of the U.S. population. We’ve 
become a sort of sticking point in the culture 
war, now that it’s becoming increasingly ap-
parent that rights for cis white gays and lesbi-
ans have been, for the moment, asserted and 
accepted in public life. Conservatives who 
want to win mainstream appeal have found 
that trans people are an easier target than 
our gay counterparts. This strategy has been 
particularly effective in the UK, where the 
most virulent transphobia is now more or less 
mainstream. In the U.S., the mainstream me-
dia is less saturated with this sort of rhetoric, 
but we see legislative debates about trans ac-
cess to bathrooms, locker rooms and school 
athletics.

It’s frustrating to find oneself on the other 

end of this, especially given that trans people 
are not often allowed a seat at the media ap-
paratus or the legislative debates to which we 

are subject. When we are given a voice, the 
case for our continued existence is framed 
as one side of a “debate.” For most of us, the 
recourse we have is to continually check the 
news, watching as the specter made of our 
community is endlessly scrutinized. 
I

t’s been a weird couple of weeks to be 
trans. One of the more high-profile 
celebrities who have revealed them-

selves to be transphobic is the author J.K. 
Rowling, who posted a nearly 4,000 word es-
say on her website on June 10 titled “J.K. Row-
ling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking 
out on Sex and Gender Issues.” The original 
title of the piece was “TERF Wars,” the acro-
nym standing for “trans-exclusionary radi-
cal feminist.” I’ve always found the label of 
TERF to be a little dubious, because it allows 
transphobes to claim the legacy and historical 
cause of feminism, which J.K. Rowling at least 
purports to do. 

I’m reluctant to close-read the essay and 

pick it apart piece-by-piece. Other people have 
done it better, and moreover there’s nothing 
new in it. If you’ve spent any amount of time 
reading transphobic writing — which I have, 
probably to the detriment of my mental health 
— you’ve seen all these talking points before. 
Generally, the transphobic media landscape 
operates like this: No matter how banal or 
easily refuted their points are, you keep seeing 
them crop up in another article, another fo-
rum post, another tweet thread. Sometimes it 
feels like these points are repeated so endless-
ly with the hope that people will be convinced 
by them, and more to saturate the public nar-

rative around trans people’s existence. The 
more time trans people and our allies spend 
refuting these points, the more public airtime 
they get, and the more these same talking 
points filter into public consciousness in the 
form of truisms and “common sense.” 

And so, in summary: Rowling sees trans 

women as predatory men seeking access to 
“single sex spaces,” particularly bathrooms 
and locker rooms designated for women. Her 
appraisal of trans men is essentially that they 
are women, and therefore passive victims of 
patriarchy whose transitions represent false 
solutions to the ordinary kinds of alienation 
women suffer from in adolescence and early 
adulthood. Her deterministic, essentially bi-
nary thinking is apparent, even though she 
assures us that she doesn’t categorically hate 
trans people. She’s just against what she calls 
a “theory of gender identity” or “the current 
trans activism” that persuades people to tran-
sition when they should be doing something 
else. To back this up, she points to an (un-
sourced) statistic that “between 60-90% of 
gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their 
dysphoria.” 

Her writing is couched in a peculiar appro-

priation of the language of concern. Of course, 
we are led to believe, Rowling is simply con-
cerned about trans activism going too far, 
overstepping its rightful place. To give some 
idea of what she sees as the rightful place of 
trans activism, she at one point describes a 
trans woman friend whose transition she 
deems appropriate, and contrasts it with the 
current trans activism:

“She went through a long and rigorous pro-

cess of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged 
transformation. The current explosion of 
trans activism is urging a removal of almost all 
the robust systems through which candidates 
for sex reassignment were once required to 
pass.” 

There’s a term that trans people used to use 

in the ‘70s and ‘80s known as “crash landing.” 
This referred to rejection from a gender iden-
tity clinic after this “rigorous process of evalu-
ation.” The medical establishment basically 
told these trans people that they were out of 
luck, that they couldn’t live normal lives as 
women or men, and so they should just try to 
live with the gender they were born with. One 
wonders, in this light, how many fewer trans 
people would exist if Rowling’s “rigorous pro-
cess” was the norm — if clinicians once again 
were the final arbiter of who could transition 
or not. The important thing here is that some-
one else is deciding for us. Generally, I don’t 
like those odds.

I could go on and on but I’ve already given 

Rowling too much space. I’ve encountered 
these same ideas so many times that my re-
action to her essay wasn’t even really one of 
anger. I just felt my heart sink a little bit at the 
sight of someone in such a position of influ-
ence making these kinds of statements.

D

ear Readers,

The Statement Magazine is a 

unique student-driven publica-

tion that is dedicated to providing long-form 
reporting, political and cultural commen-
tary, along with lighthearted narratives. We 
are committed to providing accurate and 
thought-provoking content. As millions of 

Americans across the country have taken to 
the streets to protest George Floyd’s mur-
der and the ongoing racial inequalities that 
plague the country, we feel the need to honor 
our magazine’s origin. In light of the recent 
outbreaks of protests, our priorities have 
changed, and we will not be publishing the 
scheduled pieces for this week’s edition. We 
recognize that our role as a news publica-
tion has a serious responsibility to amplify 
the voices of those who have been silenced, 
and are dedicated to doing so in future edi-
tions. Our current cohort is made up of 
non-Black writers and editors, and thus we 
acknowledge that we will never personally 
understand the experiences that the Black 
community faces. We are committed to con-
sistently checking our privilege both as indi-
viduals and as a team, as well as actively pur-
suing anti-racist efforts through unlearning 
of status quo. 

As contributors to a large publication, we 

fundamentally believe that silence is not the 
answer. We vow to take the time to educate 
ourselves on racism, injustice, and violence, 

and dedicate ourselves to amplifying the 
voices of those who have been wrongfully 
silenced. We are frustrated and heartbroken 
by the brutal murders of Ahmaud Arbery, 
Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, as well 
as the numerous other innocent members of 
the Black community who have unrightfully 
been targeted by years of systemic racism. 
The current state of the world represents an-
ger that is rooted not only in these murders 
but also centuries of violence, injustice, and 
oppression. We stand in solidarity with the 
Black community and the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement. We believe that everybody 
deserves to be treated with respect and to 
live without fear. We are determined to play 
a part in making a long-overdue change and 
fighting for what is right. 

We also want to voice our support for the 

journalists in the field covering the ongoing 
protests, and working to expose the horrific 
and cyclical injustices harming our country. 
Many are being silenced, mainly by the po-
lice, while risking their lives in an attempt to 
shed light on the developing situation. Still, 

we want to acknowledge the media’s historic 
role in propagating biases against the Black 
community. 

In line with our mission and determina-

tion to provide a platform for student voic-
es, our publication, as always, is accepting 
contributions. If you would like to submit 
a piece, or if you have suggestions for how 
The Statement can best serve the University 
of Michigan and Ann Arbor communities 
going forward, please contact our team at 
statement@michigandaily.com

We encourage our readers to join us in ed-

ucating ourselves through engaging in active 
conversations, checking our biases, holding 
friends and family accountable, diversifying 
knowledge, and leaning into the discomfort 
that may arise in doing so. 

We thank you for your continued support 

of The Statement Magazine. 

Sincerely,

The 2020 Summer Statement Staff

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach Juwan Howard said that 
he will stay at Michigan in a 
statement responding to a report 
from ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski 
that Howard has been gaining 
traction in NBA front offices as a 
potential head coaching candidate.

“While I am flattered, and know 

it will more than likely happen 
again, I am not exploring, seeking 
or listening,” Howard said. “I am 
the head coach at the University of 
Michigan.”

The NBA buzz surrounding 

Howard is not surprising; he 
interviewed for coaching positions 
with the Cleveland Cavaliers and 
the Los Angeles Lakers before 
taking the job at Michigan. His 
strong 19-year stint as a player and 
successful transition into assistant 
coaching in the NBA both make 
him a strong candidate. 

This already-impressive resume 

was likely only bolstered in the 
eyes of front-office executives by 

Howard’s impressive first year 
at Michigan. Howard showed 
level-headed – but still animated 
– leadership over the course of a 
season that saw junior forward 
and top scorer Isaiah Livers 
struggle with lingering injuries, 
a suspension of star senior point 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson, 
and 

postseason cancellations due to 
the coronavirus. Despite these 
and other significant roadblocks, 
Howard led the Wolverines to a 
solid 19-12 overall record.

But Howard’s decision to stay 

in Ann Arbor is also somewhat 
unsurprising. He was visibly 
emotional in the opening press 
conference when his hire was 
announced, 
especially 
when 

his old jersey was brought out. 
He has moved his family to the 
Ann Arbor area, put his younger 
children in schools in the area, 
and brought his son Jace onto the 
team with a scholarship. 

“This is where my focus is,” 

said Howard. “We have goals, 
dreams, and championships to 
win.”

at Michigan: ‘This is 
where my focus is’

Players feel voices weren’t heard in postponement

Carlo Kemp isn’t on social media, 

so he didn’t see the petition Ohio 
State quarterback Justin Fields 
circulated this week. Signed by 
281,000 people as of Wednesday 
afternoon, it asks the Big Ten to 
reinstate the fall football season. 
Told about it, Kemp had a question.

“Where is it?”
“There’s people that want to 

play and there are people that are 
willing to accept or take on the risk 
we talked about being able to play,” 
Kemp, a fifth-year defensive tackle, 
said. “However many votes it has, it 
doesn’t matter, but it shows you that 
athletes want to play and people 
want to play football. Hearing and 
listening to that, I do think there’s a 
way this could have been done.”

In a lot of ways, that sums up the 

criticism many players, parents and 
coaches have for the Big Ten right 
now. They want to play. And they 
feel their voices weren’t heard in 
the process.

The Big Ten isn’t standing 

alone in calling things off — the 
majority of the FBS has, and the 
FCS schedule has been reduced 
to a handful of guarantee games. 
But it is the only conference that’s 
suffered a complete, unmitigated 
public relations disaster because of 
its decision. The timing, just days 
after a conference-only schedule 
was released, was poor. The 
reasoning wasn’t explained clearly. 
It’s been over a week and it’s still 
unclear whether school presidents 
actually took a formal vote, and if so, 
what the count was — not just to the 
public, but to the conference’s own 
athletic directors.

“If 
you’re 
going 
to 
affect 

someone’s livelihood, I think it’s 
really important that you hear from 
them,” Kemp said. “Personally, I do 
think we should’ve been heard. I 
think there were some great efforts 
to get that done. I think people did 
go to good lengths to hear from 
their student athletes. But it’s just 
the tip and you’re hoping that more 
can be done in the future. 

“Do student athletes want to 

play, do they not want to play, and 
I think that should really influence 
the decision a little bit more. And 
then hearing how we feel right now 
is where I go back to this limbo that 
we’re in. The decision was made 
and we’re just expected to go along 
with it. A lot of things change once 
you do that, and I don’t think that 
was really taken into consideration 
how a lot of this stuff gets affected 
going forward.”

Student-athletes 
aren’t 
paid, 

but no season means they won’t 
have a chance to show their skills 
to NFL teams. It means guys who 
weren’t on the NFL radar won’t get 
a chance to put themselves there. As 
Heisman winner and No. 1 overall 
pick Joe Burrow tweeted, that 
would have been him a year ago.

When coach Jim Harbaugh 

broke the news to the team that 
the season had been postponed, 
some players cried, fifth-year senior 
tight end Nick Eubanks said. Others 
just thought about what’s next — a 
question that still doesn’t have an 

answer.

The Big Ten might try to play a 

spring season, but there’s been no 
plan developed — let alone released 
— as of yet. To the outside world, it 
looks like the conference didn’t plan 
for the possibility of a cancellation 
until it actually made the decision 
to cancel.

Speaking with reporters on 

Wednesday, Eubanks and Kemp 
both made the same points as 
Harbaugh did last week in a 
statement advocating for a fall 
season. Michigan followed the 
protocols, had low rates of infection 
and felt they could have continued 
to do so during the season. Whether 
it would have withstood the return 
of students to campus, and whether 
other schools would have been as 
successful, is unclear. They would 
have liked the chance to find out.

“Honestly I think we could’ve did 

the same thing for our conference 
as well as other conferences,” 
Eubanks said. “It’s quite frustrating. 
A lot of guys had a lot riding on this 
season coming up. Just for it to get 
shut down, it really hurts a lot of 
teammates and players.”

It hasn’t quite hit Kemp yet, the 

idea that while he’s on his couch 
during Saturdays this fall, he might 
be watching other college football 
games. The idea that guys might 
get a season while he doesn’t. He’s 
just trying to work on his game with 
the limitations in place, coming into 
Schembechler Hall and practicing 
whenever allowed.

“I hope all the information 

is being distributed and talked 
about throughout the conferences, 
not just for football reasons, but 
for safety,” Kemp said. “If we’ve 
canceled, you want to make sure 
that the remaining players in the 
other three conferences are as safe, 
as well.”

How the Michigan men’s soccer 

team found out its season was over

Tuesday morning marked a 

long-awaited return to normalcy 
for the Michigan men’s soccer 
team. 

Players 
and 
coaches 
took 

the pitch for the first full-team 
training session of the summer. 
Masks were worn and safety 
measures followed. Smiles were 
contagious. 

Even 
amid 
a 
particularly 

ominous backdrop — their fall 
season rumored to be teetering 
on the brink of cancellation — the 
team left practice upbeat. 

“Being together, it was very 

much missed,” coach Chaka Daley 
said. “Just being back, seeing 
each other, having a bit of banter, 
watching guys compete and play 
soccer, that’s what we’ve missed 
over the last five months.”

At 5:30, the team gathered 

again. The morning’s joy had 
turned into melancholy, grins 
wiped 
away 
by 
long 
faces. 

Daley briefed his players on the 
afternoon’s news — due to the 
unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Big Ten had postponed all fall 
sports. 

A hush descended over the 

team. The reality set in. One 
precious morning — that would 
be it. 

“It’s really hard right now,” 

senior 
forward 
Mohammed 

Zakyi said. “There’s so many 
uncertainties. I’m just trying to 
keep my head up and not sulk 
about all this.”

The Big Ten’s decision leaves 

Zakyi and his teammates in limbo. 

Question marks are pressing and 
copious. Answers, largely absent. 

“Seniors, we don’t even know 

if we have another year left,” 
Zakyi said. “I have so much stuff 
to figure out, with my eligibility, 
with my visa, with everything. 
What options come after this 
year? I aspire to go to the MLS, but 
I don’t know if there’s going to be a 
draft, if I’ll get to train here, if we’ll 
have a season. It’s just really hard.”

Up 
until 
Tuesday’s 
coup 

de grace, the team remained 
optimistic that a fall season could 
safely take place. 

Closely adhering to University 

guidelines, players filtered back to 
campus the first week of August 
to prepare for the season. Players 
followed the 14-day pre-report 
risk assessment prior to their 
return and complied with the six-
day resocilization period, which 
involved a series of tests and 
health screenings. 

Monday, the team met as one 

for the first time. Tuesday was 
meant to kickstart the first week 
of preparation for the fall slate. But 
with the pandemic still at large, 
the Big Ten decided that college 
athletics weren’t feasible. 

“Obviously, 
we’re 

disappointed,” Daley said. “No 
competitive 
student-athlete 
is 

going to take this news well. I 
do know that they all had a very 
good sense of realism, going into 
it understanding that we are in a 
global pandemic and that we’re 
fortunate just to be back.

“We just didn’t know the 

timeliness of this, that it would’ve 
happened as quickly as it did 
when we started our preseason. 

We were hopeful to have a little 
bit more time to see if things 
could work, but all the medical 
professionals, our University, our 
Athletic Department and the Big 
Ten made a decision that’s best for 
all the student-athletes.”

The team will continue to meet 

on a regular basis, likely a mixture 
of in-person training, scheduled 
workouts and Zoom calls, Daley 
said. 

As per a potential season, all 

eyes turn toward the spring — 
a scenario not without its own 
issues. 

“I don’t know how it would 

work because there are so many 
other sports going on,” Zakyi 
said. “If you add all the fall 
sports to that, it could get pretty 
overwhelming.”

The spring, though, presents 

itself as the only option for a 
season. Putting the uncertainty of 
the situation aside, Daley knows 
his team would embrace the idea. 

“If we can compete this 

academic year, I’m sure the 
student-athletes would welcome 
the challenge and enjoy it,” Daley 
said. “And there are challenges 
with everything now. Playing 
in the fall, playing in the spring. 
You look at the spring sports, they 
already lost a season last year.

“Hopefully, we get through 

the other side of this in a positive 
way. And if we’re afforded the 
opportunity to play in the spring, 
our players will be motivated, 
hungry and ready to go.”

“We don’t know what’s going 

to happen,” Zakyi said. “But it 
would just be great to have the 
opportunity to play again.”

The Michigan men’s soccer team’s fall season was postponed last week due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Michigan women’s soccer team 
devastated by canceled season

The 
decision 
was 
highly 

anticipated and largely expected. 
But, nonetheless, it was met with 
heartbreak and devastation. 

Coming off one of the best 

seasons in recent history, the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
was poised for another stellar 
season. But, like the rest of the 
college sports world, that chance 
at redemption will be put on hold 
until at least the spring as the Big 
Ten announced that all fall sports 
would be postponed.

“I think what’s one of the 

things that has been the biggest 
disappointment is the excitement 
that this whole team had around 
this upcoming fall,” Michigan 
head coach Jennifer Klein said. 
“(We know) what this team 
would be able to accomplish and 
(we) really wanted to get out 
there and get tested and see if 
we could raise the level of our 
program.”

Regardless, 
the 
team 

acknowledges 
that 
this 
is 

bigger than sports, however 
tough it is to accept the season’s 
postponement.

No 
one 
has 
experienced 

anything 
of 
this 
magnitude 

before — it’s beyond even a 
season-ending injury.

“Injuries are easier,” senior 

goalkeeper Hillary Beal said. 
“You go through them and 
there’s kind of an endpoint and 
you 
determine 
when 
you’re 

allowed to return to play. But 
this is (different) because you 
don’t know when there’s an end 

(in) sight and you don’t know 
when you’re going to have the 
opportunity to take the field 
again and start competing.” 

The 
Wolverines 
had 
just 

finished their first week of 
practice 
back 
together 
after 

a lengthy off-season and the 
team picked up right where 
they left off last season in 
terms of competitiveness and 
togetherness with the team. 

“There was a lot of great energy 

and just appreciation for being 
back together as a team,” Klein 
said. “(We) really had optimism 
and hope that we would be able to 
pull a season off in the fall. ... But 
it just didn’t make sense for us to 
move forward in that way.”

Now, with the season officially 

postponed, the focus will shift 
from preparing for competition 
to 
developing 
the 
freshman 

class, focusing on the future and 
keeping the morale of the team 
high. Klein sees this challenging 
time as a defining moment for the 
future of the program. 

Each player is affected in a 

different manner, but no group 
of players is affected as much 
as the senior class. The seniors 
recognize that they can use this 
time to develop the freshman 
class and, although they may 
have 
finished 
their 
careers, 

they can impact the future. 
Beal sees a silver lining in this 
unprecedented situation. 

“For now, we get to be around 

each other,” Beal said. “I think 
it’s more gratitude and just being 
thankful for the opportunities we 
get to have together as a team.”

As a fall sport, Michigan is 

used to jumping straight into the 
season without having much time 
to adjust to a new team. The new 
extended offseason has its pros 
and cons. 

“It does give us more time to 

prepare and to reach those goals,” 
sophomore 
forward 
Danielle 

Wolfe said. “Also having that much 
time you’re prone more to being 
relaxed and falling back. (But), 
this team, everyone has their eye 
on the prize and everyone knows 
what they want.”

Every college athlete is going 

through 
a 
similar 
range 
of 

emotions, but Wolfe is especially 
proud to be a part of this team 
during this time. 

“Going through this together 

with them is like a blessing for all 
of us,” Wolfe said. “The good and 
bad, I think that’s a big part of 
being a part of this team.”

For Klein, it is essential during 

this time that the team stay 
focused on what they have worked 
on in terms of accountability and 
owning your development. 

“Dealing 
with 
adversity, 

dealing with sudden change, all 
those things existed at different 
points of our life,” Klein said. “I 
think everybody has a time in their 
life where they look and the path 
in front of you isn’t clear, but you 
have to trust the process and trust 
the people around you that you’re 
going to eventually see the end.

“(You have to) stay optimistic 

and positive that it will turn out. 
It might not look exactly like you 
thought it would, but it’s going 
to have to. There’s going to be 
something that is going to be 
positive at the end.”

Michigan coach Jennifer Klein was excited about the Wolverines’ upcoming season before it was postponed.


Nancy Eubanks’s job isn’t 

one that lends itself to social 
distancing. She’s the catering 
director 
for 
Zingerman’s 

Delicatessen, a job that like so 
many in Ann Arbor, is made 
possible by large groups of 
people. Especially every other 
Saturday in the fall.

Eubanks 
has 
a 
routine 

on 
those 
Saturdays. 
She 

wakes up to the sound of the 
400-member marching band 
practicing at Elbel Field, a few 
blocks away from her house. 
She traverses her way through 
throngs of tailgaters to the 
deli, where dozens of workers 
prepare upwards of 2,000 
sandwiches, just for catering. 
Then she goes out to deliver 
those sandwiches to tailgates, 
some of them with hundreds 

of fans, all preparing to watch 
a football game with 110,000 
more.

It’s a routine that makes the 

deli $250,000 in an average 
season. It’s also a coronavirus 
nightmare, which is why it 
won’t be happening this fall. 
That’s a decision Eubanks 
understands. She wants Ann 
Arbor to stay safe and knows 
that desire is incompatible 
with football.

But for Zingerman’s, and 

countless 
other 
businesses 

in the region, the financial 
impact 
is 
catastrophic. 

According to a 2015 economic 
impact 
report 
performed 

by the Anderson Economic 
Group, the average Michigan 
football season brings roughly 
$82 million into the Ann Arbor 
economy.

And while that’s only 0.16 

percent of the Ann Arbor 
GDP, 
according 
to 
Stefan 

Szymanski, a professor of 
economics at the University, 
it’s concentrated in a handful 
of 
industries. 
The 
overall 

economy, 
Szymanski 
says, 

is propped up by big money 
makers, 
like 
University 

tuition, the medical center 
and major technological and 
manufacturing 
companies. 

Those revenue streams won’t 
be affected much, if at all, by a 
lack of football season.

For others, though — think 

hotels, restaurants and apparel 
shops — it’s an unmitigated 
disaster.

“A lot of these businesses are 

facing absolutely catastrophic 
financial 
situations 
and 

many of these businesses are 
likely to go bust,” Szymanski 
said. “In the long term, these 
businesses or other businesses 
will return to these locations 
once the crisis is over. So we’ll 
come out of this one day. But 

that’s not much consolation if 
your life savings are tied up in 
a business that’s going down 
the tubes now.”

And that’s where the real 

problem lies for Ann Arbor. 
The pandemic, now in its sixth 
month, has already brought 
a “pain point” Diane Keller 
has not seen in her 18 years 
as the president of the Ann 
Arbor/Ypsilanti Chamber of 
Commerce. Now, for many 
local businesses — and their 
workers — the loss of football 
serves as a calamitous cherry 
on top.

“It’s going to be devastating,” 

Keller said, letting out a deep 
sigh. “And the thing is it’s 
going to affect certain levels 
and some types of businesses 
more than others.”

Rishi Narayan owns one 

of those businesses. When 
he co-founded Underground 
Printing 
in 
2001, 
it 
was 

exclusively a custom printing 
venture. And while that’s still 
its biggest revenue stream, the 
chain relies on college towns 
more than most.

Of Underground Printing’s 

24 brick-and-mortar stores, 21 
are in towns with FBS football 
teams, including every Big Ten 
city except Columbus — out 
of principle. In Ann Arbor, its 
downtown location shuttered 
over half its floor space last 
year when a new MDen moved 
in next door. Now, the future 
of its remaining locations is 
in peril. Five months after 
originally 
shutting 
down, 

those locations have yet to 
resume full hours — a move 
that 
will 
be 
indefinitely 

delayed by lack of a football 
season.

“On a face level, you would 

say, there’s (these) sales from 
gamedays,” Narayan said. “But 
on a much more macro level, 

there’s an overall economy 
that’s spurred from football. 
It’s the local businesses that 
are gearing up and those 
businesses are customers of 
ours.

“…Maybe one day, we’ll look 

back and try to quantify it. But 
it is unquantifiable.”

The impact for Underground 

Printing is such that football 
season rose to the forefront 
of Narayan’s concerns back 
in April, as soon as it became 
apparent the pandemic wasn’t 
going to end anytime soon. For 
a while, he found comfort in 
the belief that there would be 
a season, even without fans. 
While that would have done 
little for the brick-and-mortar 
locations, custom printing still 
sees a boost during football 
season.

Now, 
like 
Eubanks 
and 

so many others, he’s left 
scrambling again.

“Things 
are 
constantly 

changing,” 
Narayan 
said. 

“… It’s really hard to make 
committed plans. So for a 
lot of businesses in the area, 
it’s all about having variable 
plans and plans that can flex 
pretty easily or having a lot of 
iterations of plans. Everyone’s 
got their own strategy.”

On 
a 
larger 
scale, 
the 

persistent uncertainty terrifies 
Keller. Back in March, she 
says, each business concocted 
its own plan to stay afloat. But 
as the pandemic mows down 
each window of economic 
activity in its path — first 
graduation, then summer, now 
football season — those plans 
have 
become 
increasingly 

untenable.

“Every business is different 

and I don’t know how all 
businesses are going to be able 
to pivot,” Keller said. “And 
so that’s why I’m worried 

that we’re going to lose, or 
that we have lost, businesses 
that have been mainstays of 
our community that may not 
be able to make it through 
depending 
on 
how 
much 

longer this pandemic lasts.”

With football’s cancelation 

comes the added devastation of 
lost tourism dollars. According 
to the AEG economic impact 
report, 87 percent of ticket 
holders at Michigan games 
come from outside Washtenaw 
County. And each dollar those 
visitors spend, Keller says, 
recirculates through the local 
economy 17 times.

The effect of lost tourism is 

especially profound at hotels, 
such as Weber’s Boutique. 
Almost every night, hotels like 
Weber’s offer their rooms at 
steeply discounted rates. Those 
nights keep Weber’s afloat. 
Football weekends — complete 
with packed rooms, a Saturday 
tailgate and a pregame brunch 
buffet — are what have helped 
Weber’s thrive for 83 years.

“If football came, it’d be 

great, we could start making 
money again,” Michael Weber, 
the company’s vice president, 
said. “But right now, we’re 
planning for the worst and 
just trying to stay afloat with 
all the regulations and lower 
demand that’s in place,”

Weber, though, is among 

those who greeted the Big Ten’s 
decision to cancel fall sports 
with a glimmer of optimism. 
Football season without fans, 
he says, would have provided 
minimal benefit to the hotel. 
Now, he can hold out some 
hope, however faint it is.

And maybe, just maybe, 

come March, Nancy Eubanks 
can hop in her truck across 
town, 2,000 sandwiches in 
tow, and make Ann Arbor 
smile again.

‘It’s going to be devastating’:

In Ann Arbor, businesses stare down a fall without football

T

here’s this 
moment I can’t get 
out of my head. 
I haven’t been 

able to for five months — not 
since mid-
March, when 
COVID-19 
shut down 
college 
sports. 

It’s 
Duncan 

Robinson, 
and he’s 
standing in 
the far cor-
ner, poised 
behind the 3-point line. There’s 
a little over two minutes left 
and Michigan, in a packed 
maize and blue Staples Center, 
is close — so close — to the 
Final Four. From where I’m sit-
ting, up in the auxiliary press 
box, up near the ceiling, you 
can see Robinson’s defender 
leave him, the ball come to him 
and then float towards the net. 
All those fans down there in 
maize and blue, they lose their 
collective minds. Robinson 
turns to the bench and yells. 
The game is all but over, and 
that weird, improbable run is 
going to go for another week on 
the sport’s biggest stage. 

In that singular moment 

back in March of 2018, it feels 
like the whole world is coalesc-
ing around Michigan basket-
ball and every character on 
that team, Duncan Robinson 
chief among them.

That singular moment, it’s 

why we love sports.

Robinson’s story has been 

told again and again. You’ve 
almost certainly heard it 
before, but as a quick reminder 
we’ll rehash it here. Robinson 
started his college career play-
ing Division III ball at Wil-
liams College. He transferred 
to Michigan and, after sitting 
a year, worked his way into 
the rotation as a 3-point spe-
cialist. In his senior year, he 
struggled and got replaced by 
Isaiah Livers, then a freshman, 
in Michigan’s starting lineup. 
He came off the bench the rest 

of the year, found a key role on 
a team that went to the Final 
Four, and it seemed likely that 
the story would end there. Out 
of college, he signed a two-way 
contract with 
the Miami Heat 
and seemed con-
signed to basket-
ball purgatory. 
Then he started 
hitting threes 
for them, too 
and now he’s in 
the NBA bubble, 
playing a key role 
on a playoff team. 
When his con-
tract is up, he’s 
going to make a ton of money. 

That’s cool as hell.
I’m not telling you this 

because you didn’t already 
know — this is probably the 

100th time you’ve heard Rob-
inson’s story. I’m talking about 
this now for the same reason I 
can’t get that snapshot out of 
my head:

When I think 

about why it’s a 
shame the Big 
Ten postponed 
fall sports, I 
think about 
Duncan Rob-
inson.

Hold on a 

minute. Don’t 
laugh. I know 
Duncan Rob-
inson plays a 
winter sport. 

I understand there’s bet-
ter reasons to have sports or 
not, there’s more at play here 
than one guy’s human inter-
est story. Playing sports right 

now might not be the smartest 
thing. Having students back on 
campus — especially if, like a 
lot of schools, your coronavirus 
mitigation plan amounts to a 
shoulder shrug 
and an eye roll 
— might not 
end well.

The Big 

Ten’s decision 
puts moral and 
public health 
obligations 
over financial 
gains and, 
all told, it’s 
the right call. 
The U.S. has 
done a terrible job at fighting 
the coronavirus. We’re reap-
ing what we sowed, but that 
doesn’t mean we can’t lament 
it. So let’s get back to Duncan 

Robinson and all the other 
stories that make sports worth 
watching.

Remember when Jordan 

Poole hit the shot? If you’re 

this far into this 
story, you prob-
ably remember 
where you were 
sitting and who 
you were with. 
I’ll never forget 
talking with 
Duncan Robin-
son after Jordan 
Poole hit the 
shot.

Robinson had 

fouled out of the 

game. He thought it’d be his 
last college game, thought he’d 
been partially responsible for 
a crushing loss. The look on 
his face, the tone in his voice 

when he spoke in the locker 
room. That was something to 
remember.

“I don’t think I’ve ever cried 

tears of joy,” Robinson said 
that night. “But I was damn 
close.”

Forget, for a minute, about 

the fact that Robinson is now 
an NBA player with an NBA 
career and all the amenities 
that come with it. Because 
right then, he was a college kid 
and the best thing he’d ever 
been involved in had just got-
ten improbably extended for 
another week.

Now think about all the 

athletes at Michigan (and 
elsewhere), all with their own 
stories and hours of work and 
breakthroughs to get to where 
they are, and what they all 
must have been on Tuesday 
when the announcement came 
down.

Think about Nick Blanken-

burg, a junior defenseman on 
the hockey team who plays 
every game for his grandfa-
ther, and Nick Granowicz, his 
teammate, who’s playing for 
his mom. Think about Moham-
med Zakyi and Omar Farouk 
Osman, who started their soc-
cer careers playing with paper 
bags and folded clothes, and 
now likely won’t have their 
senior years. Think about 
Paige Jones and all the people 
in New Bremen, Ohio watch-
ing her play volleyball for 
Michigan. Think about Maddie 
Nolan working her way back 
from a microfracture to play 
basketball for Michigan.

Think about what they’re 

feeling now, after their fall sea-
sons got canceled. Those that 
play in the winter can’t be feel-
ing good about their chances of 
having a season either.

The Big Ten made the right 

decision. But as long as we can 
acknowledge that, let’s also 
take a minute to appreciate all 
the stories, all the players, all 
the games and everything else 
we won’t get to have this year, 
because it’s all improbable, and 
at any moment it could all be 
over. Now, more than ever.

The stories we’ll miss without a fall season

Without fall sports, we will miss out on the stories that sports bring, such as tight end Nick Eubanks playing in memory of his late mother.

We’re reaping 
what we sowed, 
but that doesn’t 
mean we can’t 

lament it.

Think about all
the athletes at

Michigan

(and elsewhere),

all with their
own stories.


There may finally be some clarity 

surrounding college football.

After a meeting on Tuesday 

morning, Big Ten Presidents and 
Chancellors voted to postpone fall 
sports.

“The mental and physical health 

and welfare of our student-athletes 
has been at the center of every 
decision we have made regarding 
the ability to proceed forward,” Big 

Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren 
said. “As time progressed and after 
hours of discussion with our Big Ten 
Task Force for Emerging Infectious 
Diseases and the Big Ten Sports 
Medicine Committee, it became 
abundantly clear that there was 
too much uncertainty regarding 
potential medical risks to allow our 
student-athletes to compete this 
fall.”

Men’s 
and 
women’s 
soccer 

and cross country, field hockey, 
volleyball and football will all be 

affected by the decision.

The unprecedented move comes 

in times dominated by confusion. 
The decision was made a day 
after the Big Ten refuted multiple 
reports that the college Presidents 
of the conference voted to cancel fall 
athletics over the weekend. Reports 
are that the PAC-12 will follow 
the Big Ten’s path and postpone 
its season, with hopes of a Spring 
season for the sports affected.

“For the second time in five 

months, the Big Ten Conference 

made the unfortunate but necessary 
decision to postpone an athletic 
season in order to protect the health 
and well-being of our student-
athletes, staff, and community 
members,” 
Michigan 
athletic 

directory Warde Manuel said in 
a release Tuesday. “As a result, 
all fall sport schedules have been 
postponed. This latest decision was 
reached after careful consideration 
and the grim knowledge that this 
pandemic continues to affect our 
country adversely. I am deeply 
saddened for our student-athletes 
and remain committed to our 
ongoing promise to provide them 
with 
a 
world-class 
education. 

We 
remain 
grateful 
to 
our 

global Michigan family for their 
unwavering support.”

The decision to cancel contradicts 

the wishes of its players and coaches, 
who took to Twitter Sunday to 
tweet support for playing football. 
Jim Harbaugh on Monday released 
a statement in support of playing 
football, saying his program has 
been able to limit the spread of 
COVID-19. Nebraska coach Scott 
Frost said Nebraska will explore 
every option to play football, even if 
the Big Ten votes to cancel.

“Our 
football 
team, 
our 

coaching staff, our support stadd 
in Schembechler Hall have all 
stepped up, followed every rule, 
and done everything in their 
power magnificently to give all 
the opportunity to compete,” 
Harbaugh’s 
new 
statement 
on 

Tuesday said. “I am extremely 
proud, thankful and appreciative 

of our team and how they have 
conducted and represented our 
program and university.”

A spokesperson for the football 

team told The Daily that the team 
will continue to hold voluntary 
practices, meetings and strength 
and conditioning for 20 hours per 
week, including practice on Tuesday. 
The statement released by athletic 
director Warde Manuel says that all 
athletic activities will be suspended 
immediately, including practices. 
The Daily was told that line will 
change on the announcement, as the 
Big Ten cleared Michigan to work 
under the 20-hour rule.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel released a statement on 
Twitter supporting the decision 
to postpone, in contrast with 
Harbaugh.

“I fully support the difficult 

Big Ten decision to postpone fall 
athletics competition,” Schlissel 
wrote. “There are too many poorly 
understood 
health 
and 
safety 

concerns unique to intercollegiate 
athletics to move forward with 
practices 
and 
competition 
at 

present -- and the impact of extreme 
physical exertion on the health risk 
of COVID-19 has not been well-
assessed.

“I join athletic director Warde 

Manuel and everyone at Michigan 
Athletics 
in 
expressing 
my 

empathy to all who were looking 
forward to competing, coaching, 
supporting 
and 
cheering 
us 

on as members of the Wolverine 
family. I particularly feel badly for 
our student-athletes who gain so 

much from participation in their 
sports and are such outstanding 
representatives of the university. 
We will work hard to return them 
safely to competition.”

The delay gives both America 

and colleges time to contain the 
spread of the virus and adjust to the 
return of students, one of the biggest 
hurdles that still faces colleges 
trying to return safely and educate 
its students. In order for there to be 
sports, first the student population 
on campus must be healthy and the 
Big Ten needs to know the impact 
that students have on the numbers 
of COVID-19 cases.

“While I know our decision 

today will be disappointing in many 
ways for our thousands of student-
athletes 
and 
their 
families,” 

Warren said, “I am heartened and 
inspired by their resilience, their 
insightful and discerning thoughts, 
and their participation through 
our conversations to this point. 
Everyone associated with the Big 
Ten Conference and its member 
institutions is committed to getting 
everyone back to competition as 
soon as it is safe to do so.”

Time, right now, is all the Big Ten 

has that can make the possibility 
of any sports a reality, something 
that schools across the country 
have been trying to get more of 
throughout the summer as the 
decision has been delayed time and 
time again. Now, it has until spring 
to make a the final decision.

Speak with your advisor about 

these nursing prerequisites

• Anatomy and Physiology (NURS 210 and 211)

• Developmental Psychology (PSYCH 250)

• English Composition (ENG 124 or 125)

• Introductory Psychology (PSYCH 111)

• Organic Biochemistry (BIOLCHEM 212)

*Statistics is not a required prerequisite for admission, however, this 
course is required to successfully complete your nursing degree. The 
School of Nursing strongly encourages students to take this course 
prior to starting their program, as admitted students who opt to not 
take it prior to admission will have it added to their fall course load.
