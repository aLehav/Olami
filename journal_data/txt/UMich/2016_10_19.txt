Last week, a new school 

faculty transition team was 
appointed to plan the transition 
from the School of Natural 
Resources and Environment to 
a new School of Sustainability.

An 
internal 
faculty 

committee 
proposed 
in 

September 
2016 
that 
the 

University of Michigan create 
a new school of sustainability 
to 
replace 
the 
School 
of 

Natural 
Resources 
and 

Environment 
and 
increase 

interdisciplinary collaboration 
across various sustainability 
and environmental programs. 
The school is set to be created 

by the end of the next academic 
year.

University Provost Martha 

Pollack said in an interview 
the recommendation for the 
new school, outlined in a 
November 2015 report, was 
created 
after 
an 
external 

committee 
reviewed 
the 

University’s 
sustainability 

programs — including SNRE, 
the 
Graham 
Sustainability 

Institute and LSA’s Program 
in the Environment — last fall. 
The external review concluded 
that there was strength in the 
current programs, but a need 
for greater synergy between 
them. In response, the internal 
committee proposed the new 
school of sustainability as one 

This article is part of a Michigan 

Daily series profiling the four 
candidates seeking a seat on the 
Board of Regents this November at 
the University of Michigan.

A member of the University 

of Michigan’s Board of Regents 
for the past eight years, Regent 
Denise Ilitch (D) is running for 
her second term this November.

Current 
Regent 
Laurence 

Deitch (D), as well as Ron Weiser 
(R), former chairman of the 
Michigan 
Republican 
Party 

and Carl Meyers (R), a financial 
advisor in Dearborn, are also 
on the ballot as major party 
candidates.

A University alumnus, Ilitch 

stands out on the board for a 
steady history voting against 
tuition increases. Her campaign 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 

accessible, affordable education at 
the University.

“I am laser-focused,” Ilitch said 

when describing the priorities 
of her campaign. “I want to stay 
laser-focused on an affordable, 
accessible, quality education for 
all students.”

Ilitch was the first member 

of her family, which included 
seven siblings, to attend college. 
She started her business career 
as a pizza maker in her family’s 
business, Ilitch Holdings, Inc., 
and worked her way to the 
position of president. She is 
currently 
president 
of 
Ilitch 

Enterprises LLC, and co-owner 

of 220 Restaurant Hospitality, an 
Italian-American food restaurant 
located in Birmingham.

Ilitch said along with tuition, 

votes to increase mental health 
funding and has worked to 
improve awareness of sexual 
assault on campus were some 
of the most impactful parts 
of her first term, issues that 

Ilitch highlighted as important 
moments of her tenure.

“I strongly support the safety 

programs for our students,” Ilitch 
said. “Sexual assault prevention is 
a huge issue on many campuses 
across the country and including 
ours.”

As part of her campaign, Ilitch 

is calling for the creation of a 

committee on the board dedicated 
to researching potential sources 
of revenue besides tuition. She 
was one of the three regents to 
vote against a 3.9 percent tuition 
increase this June, and the only 
Democrat to do so. She said she 
believes that the current cost of 
education and the consistent

“one-size-fits-all” approach does

University 
of 
Michigan 

Comprehensive Cancer Center 
and 
Tempus, 
a 
health-tech 

company 
based 
in 
Chicago, 

announced a partnership last 
week to enhance personalized 
treatment for cancer patients 
nationwide. 

The partnership, called the 

Michigan Oncology Sequencing 
Center panel, stemmed from 
the University’s MI-ONCOSEQ 
project for personalization of 
cancer therapy by using high-
throughput 
gene 
sequencing 

methods. 
Developed 
by 

Arul 
Chinnaiyan, 
director 

of the Michigan Center for 
Translational 
Pathology, 
the 

technique 
will 
provide 
new 

options for cancer cases where 
standard methods of treatment 
are ineffective or do not exist.

The panel utilizes a clinical 

sequencing-based 
approach 

to sequence DNA and RNA in 
a tumor in advanced cancer 
patients 
and 
compare 
them

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Democratic vice presidential nominee, speaks at a rally at Focus: HOPE in Detroit Tuesday.

Democratic vice presidential 

nominee Tim Kaine visited Detroit 
Tuesday to present Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton’s plan to eliminate poverty 
across the United States.

He spoke at Focus: Hope, a 

nonprofit focused on alleviating 
poverty and racial division through 
education and job training for 
underrepresented minorities.

In 
his 
remarks, 
Kaine 

highlighted revitalization efforts 
in 
Detroit, 
saying 
it 
showed 

the importance of investing in 
economic development.

“The auto industry has come 

strongly back to life,” he said. 
“This amazing city has shown 
an amazing comeback spirit, and 
you’re just getting started.”

Since filing for bankruptcy in 

2013, Detroit has been the recipient 
of tens of millions of federal dollars 
aiming to decrease blight in the 
city. Recently, a $617 million bailout 

for Detroit Public Schools was 
approved by Governor Rick Snyder 
in June 2016.

The 
plan 
Kaine 
presented 

centered 
around 
three 
main 

features: creating jobs and raising 
wages, improving opportunities in 
low-income housing communities, 
and increasing access to and quality

Former 
Secretary 
of 
State 

Madeleine Albright visited Ann 
Arbor Friday morning to campaign 
for 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton at a 
Woman to Woman event.

About 40 women and a handful 

of men crowded into the home 
of Ann Arbor resident Martha 
Darling to hear Albright speak 
about her experiences working 
with Clinton and the importance 
of women in politics.

Albright said Clinton was great 

to work with because of her ability 
to hear the issues of the people she 
spoke with.

“I loved being Secretary of 

State, and it was wonderful having 
Hillary as a partner in that,” she 
said. “She really was an amazing 
American ambassador even in 
that stage in terms of going out 
and talking and doing something 
that has been so evident of the way 
she operates, which is listening to 
people.”

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.), 

who spoke prior to Albright, 
encouraged the audience to vote, 
saying Democrats could regain

with normal cells in the same 
individual.

“The basic idea is, based on a 

patient’s molecular fingerprint, 
to suggest clinical trials or off-
label use of approved agents 
based on the mutational profile 
of 
an 
individual 
advanced 

cancer, or, in general, metastatic 
disease,” Chinnaiyan said. “By 
matching a patient’s molecular 
fingerprint with potential drugs 
that target those aberrations, we 
have a better chance at treating 
cancer in a precise or rational 
fashion.”

The University is licensing 

the MI-ONCOSEQ panel to 
Tempus. Clo Ewing, director 
of communications at Tempus, 
wrote in an email interview that 
the health-tech company aims 
to commercialize the genomic 
panel and provide access to 
clinicians 
and 
health 
care 

specialists nationwide.

“Our 
partnership 
with 

University of Michigan will allow 
patients across the country to 
benefit from clinically validated 
technology that UofM has been 

developing for years,” Ewing 
wrote. “Combined with our 
interactive analytic and machine 
learning platform will support 
physicians across the country 
working to deliver personalized 
cancer care.

Chinnaiyan 
noted 
that 

because each cancer has unique 
molecular 
characteristics, 

genetic sequencing of tumors 
can provide physicians evidence 
for decision-making in treatment 
methods.

“For example, not all breast 

cancers are the same,” he said. 
“They are caused by different 
gene aberrations and knowing 
those in a more precise fashion, 
we hope that we will be able to 
deliver more durable therapies 
for cancer patients.”

He added that the previous 

treatments for cancer such as 
chemotherapy 
and 
radiation 

were relatively non-specific.

“While you attempt to try and 

hit cancer cells, you often hit 
normal cells as well,” he said.

Since 2011, MI-ONCOSEQ has 

been utilized for more than 1,500 
patients, sequencing between 12 
and 25 patients a week.

Chinnaiyan also explained 

that MI-ONCOSEQ is reasonable 

in 
cost 
and 
turnaround 

time 
for 
delivering 
results. 

Previous approaches to genome 
sequencing 
had 
an 
average 

turnaround time six to eight 
weeks, whereas MI-ONCOSEQ 
takes about 10 days.

With the shifting paradigm 

in 
personalized 
medicine, 

MI-ONCOSEQ allows clinicians 
across the country to provide 
personalized 
cancer 
care. 

Costs for genome sequencing 
have 
significantly 
decreased 

over the past decade, making 
it 
more 
affordable 
and 

accessible, according to Ewing. 
Simultaneously, 
technological 

advancements allow for larger 
quantities of data analysis.

“Together, this means we are 

at a point in time where we can 
empower physicians to make 
real-time, data-driven decisions, 
which we hope will result in 
more time for people living with 
cancer,” Ewing wrote.

The 
unique 
partnership 

between the University and 
Tempus is facilitated by the 
close 
relationship 
between 

Chinnaiyan and the health-tech 
company’s laboratories.

Furthermore, 
the 

collaboration extends beyond 

just the panel.

“We work closely with 

Arul as he has agreed to 
become a scientific advisor 
to Tempus,” Ewing wrote. 
“We’ve developed a very 
close 
relationship 
with 

our labs cooperating on an 
almost daily basis.”

Chinnaiyan said he sees 

patients for MI-ONCOSEQ 
after 
they 
have 
failed 

multiple other treatments, 
at which point the cancer 
is evolved and difficult to 
treat.

“I think, moving into 

the future, the hope is 
that this technology of 
comprehensive 
molecular 

analysis of tumors, basically 
this 
next-generation 

sequence 
analysis, 
will 

be 
brought 
to 
earlier 

stage 
cancer 
patients,” 

he 
said. 
“By 
matching 

that combination of gene 
alterations with the right 
combination of treatment, 
we hope to be able to achieve 
more durable responses for 
cancer patients.”

The undefeated, third-

ranked Michigan football team 

may have had a bye-week this 

past weekend, but head coach 

Jim Harbaugh certainly wasn’t 

taking it easy.

On a recruiting trip to 

El Cerrito High School in 

California, Harbaugh attended a 

football game and worked on the 

‘chain gang’ — assisting officials 

with the down markers — in 

exchange for a steak sandwich, 

the Detroit Free Press reported.

“The chain gang needed 

a guy and I was promised 

a tri-tip steak sandwich at 

halftime, that’s all I needed 

to hear,” Harbaugh said on 

Monday during his weekly press 

conference. “That was a lot of 

fun.”

Known for his unusual 

recruiting trips, Harbaugh has 

had sleepovers and climbed 

tees in the past in attempts to 

impress prospects. On this trip, 

Harbaugh visited four-star 

outside linebacker recruit Aaron 

Banks at El Cerrito High. He 

also announced the homecoming 

queen on Friday at Antioch High 

School in California where he 

was visiting the top prospect in 

the country, running back Najee 

Harris, ESPN reported.

Harbaugh’s enthusiasm for 

steak is also well documented. 

He posted a picture of himself 

and wife Sarah on twitter at 

Ruth’s Chris Steak House in 

Ann Arbor last week, after a 

promotion gave customers a 

percentage off their final bill 

based on the Michigan football 

team’s margin of victory. 

Michigan defeated Rutgers 

78-0, the largest margin of a 

victory since 1939, meaning the 

steakhouse offered customers 

the maximum of 50 percent off 

their bills during the following 

week.

“Ruth’s Chris & Buzz Goebel! 

Sarah, me & Ann Arbor thank 

U for being such good sports! 

Plus the Steaks are A++, Mercy!,” 

Harbaugh’s tweet read.

control of the state House. 
Currently, 
Republicans 
have 

a majority in the state House, 
62-44.

“Not only are we going to elect 

Hillary Clinton as president, but 
the greater 12 can take the state 
House of Representatives,” she 
said. “If you’re unhappy about 
the fact that the Flint water was 
poisoned or all the others things 
that have happened, we need to 
take those seats back.”

Albright also stressed the 

importance of not becoming 
overconfident 
in 
Clinton’s 

ability to win, despite her recent 
advantage in the polls. Nationally, 
the most recent RealClearPolitics 
polling average showed Clinton 
6.7 points ahead of Republican 
presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump.

“I worry about the following 

thing,” Albright said. “I worry 
that her numbers are really up 
and people might think it’s over. 
It’s not over. … We really need to 
get out there and door knock and 
do things that get people out to 

vote.”

Trump 
has 
been 
under 

scrutiny in the past two weeks 
following the release of a tape in 
which he made comments about 
touching women without their 
consent. Since the uncovering 
of the tape, several women have 
come forward to allege that 
Trump sexually assaulted them 
in the past. Trump has denied 
these allegations, and called the 
tape “locker room talk.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Albright said 
these revelations show he is unfit 
to serve as president.

“I think the things that have 

been revealed about Donald 
Trump 
make 
it 
absolutely 

dispositive that he does not have 
the character, the moral values 
or any aspect of his temperament 
that makes it possible for him 
to be president of the United 
States — much less, frankly, to 
be a member of the public life,” 
she said. “What he has done is 
completely disgusting.”

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Barb 

Fuller, who attended the event, 
noted that Albright led a succesful 
career as a diplomat during a 
time which that type of behavior 

Trump has been accused of 
was commonplace, making her 
message especially resonant.

“Secretary Albright predates 

any disclosure of the activities of 
Donald Trump being criticized,” 
she said. “She remembers an era 
when that was totally acceptable. 
You didn’t say anything. You had 
to endure that, and she went toe-
to-toe with male leaders around 
the world and never blinked.”

Albright told the crowd that if 

women turn out to vote, Clinton 
will win in November. A recent 
FiveThirtyEight 
map 
showed 

Clinton would win by a landslide 
if only women voted, and Trump 
would win if only men voted.

“We do know that women can 

make the difference,” she said. 
“In fact, if women vote it will 
bring her over the top. Plus, she 
is incredible on women’s issues 
across the board, and also it will 
be historic.”

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright campaigns for Democratic

of education.

Kaine noted that all of the 

points 
he 
discussed 
work 

together and are essential to the 
campaign’s plan.

“We’ve got to do all these 

things at once,” he said. “We’ve 
got to invest in underserved 
communities to create jobs and 
get incomes rising; we’ve got 
to help lower income families, 
with dignified housing and safe 
communities; and we’ve got to 
give at-risk kids the skills they 
need and deserve to succeed.”

Expanding on each of these 

areas, he discussed a variety of 
policy proposals ranging from 
investments in infrastructure 
and small businesses to higher 
education reform and technical 
schools. 
Emphasizing 
the 

importance 
of 
infrastructure 

improvements, 
Kaine 
also 

discussed the Flint water crisis, 
saying it remains a priority for 
him and Clinton.

He said many other cities are at 

risk for disaster like the one that 
occurred in Flint if infrastructure 
issues are not addressed.

“A safe home means being able 

to drink the water,” he said. “And 
Flint is the tip of the iceberg on 
this because aging infrastructure, 
water infrastructure and other 
utility 
infrastructure 
around 

the country are exposing people 
to really serious environmental 
harm.”

Michigan and the city of 

Detroit have received a fair 
amount of attention in recent 
weeks, with visits from Clinton, 
Kaine, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–
Vt.) and other surrogates. Though 
the state is not as close as initially 
predicted 
by 
some, 

with Clinton now leading by 11.4 
points in a head-to-head matchup 
with 
Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald Trump in the 
state, the Republican campaign 
has also visited Michigan.

Both Trump and his vice 

presidential 
nominee,

Pence, have made stops in recent 
weeks. Pence was most recently 
in the state Monday when he 
spoke in Macomb County.

Ahead of Kaine’s visit, Joseph 

Guzman, a Michigan campaign 
co-chair for Trump issued a 
statement 
criticizing 
Clinton 

following 
a 
new 
Wikileaks 

release 
of 
campaign 
emails 

featuring remarks about Catholic 
and Evangelical voters by chief 
staffers.

“After the new leaks show the 

Clinton-Kaine team selling out 
Michigan families to Wall Street 
donors behind closed doors, their 
ticket of ‘open trade and open 

borders’ has lost all credibility 
in the Great Lakes State,” he 
wrote. “Unlike Hillary Clinton, 
Mr. Trump as President will 
unite our country, and support 
American families, workers, and 
communities of faith.”

The 
leaked 
emails 
also 

revealed 
that 
Sen. 
Debbie 

Stabenow 
(D–Mich.) 
was 

considered 
for 
the 
vice 

presidential 
candidate 
slot 

earlier 
in 
the 
campaign. 

Stabenow said she was grateful 
to be considered, but expressed 
concern over Russian hacking 
threats and cybersecurity issues.

“I think what we should all be 

concerned about in an age where 
we are all using cell phones and 
texting and emailing is that 
the Russians are hacking our 
systems,” she said at Tuesday’s 
event. “Right now it may be 
Democrats but eventually it 
should be everyone.”

yearly increases of tuition are not 
sustainable.

“I don’t think a student should 

have to mortgage their future in 
order to have one,” Ilitch said. 
“That is why I have advocated 
for alternative sources of income 
to the University so tuition does 
not burden our students and their 
family.”

Ilitch said she believes some 

of the unintended consequences 
of yearly tuition increases can 
already be seen at the University, 
like the lack of diversity. The 
University’s student population 
is predominantly white, at 56.2 
percent according to the Office of 
the Registrar in 2015.

“I’m 
not 
convinced 
our 

educational cost structure is 

sustainable,” Ilitch said. “The lack 
of diversity — economic diversity 
and race diversity — is because of 
the rising cost of tuition.”

She 
highlighted 
the 

University’s 
new 
five-year 

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
plan, which outlines strategies for 
enrolling and sustaining a diverse 
group of students and faculty, 
as one option to solve the issue, 
though she noted the importance 
of student imput.

“We 
definitely 
need 
our 

students 
involved 
actively 

and we should work in strong 
collaboration with them,” she 
said. 

Despite pushback from other 

candidates 
concerning 
the 

decision to increase University 
President Mark Schlissel’s salary 
by 3 percent in September while 
student debt is increasing, Ilitch 
said she supports his pay raise. 

She feels that though the increase 
in pay is well deserved, student 
debt 
remains 
an 
important, 

exclusive issue. 

“I think it is important to 

reward 
strong 
performance,” 

Ilitch said. “There are lots of ways 
the University can cut costs.”

A strong supporter of student 

involvement in board decisions, 
Ilitch said she has met with 
Central 
Student 
Government 

President David Schafer and CSG 
Vice President Micah Griggs, LSA 
seniors, before to discuss the best 
way to increase collaboration 
between University students and 
the board. If re-elected as regent, 
she said she would like to see a 
consistent relationship between 
the board and students that 
remains strong despite changes in 
students and board members

“As 
students 
change, 
the 

relationship should stay strong,” 

Ilitch said. “It is important to hear 
directly about student experiences 
at the University. Many of us rely 
on our own personal experiences, 
but I really welcome the input 
from our students. I think they 
are brilliant.”

As a mother of two, Ilitch said 

she often considers the University 
students her own and tries to 
consider how their parents would 
feel when making decisions. Her 
perspective, she said, is one of the 
reasons she persistently advocates 
for providing students with a well-
rounded and affordable collegiate 
experience. 

“Many 
times, 
it’s 
pretty 

simple, I have a mom hat,” Ilitch 
said. “When making decisions 
that affect many people at the 
University, I think of all the moms 
and dads out there who send their 
children to school and I feel like a 
gatekeeper.”

of the solutions to this problem.

“The idea of the new school is to 

think of new ways to bring these 
people together, new ways to 
involve students, really whole new 
ways to do education and research 
in this topic,” Pollack said.

The 
internal 
faculty 

committee 
that 
initially 

made 
recommendations 
for 

overall changes is no longer in 
operation, and the new faculty 
transition 
team 
have 
been 

charged with creating specific 
recommendations to give to the 
new dean of the school once he or 
she is appointed.

Interim 
SNRE 
Dean 
Dan 

Brown, a professor of natural 
resources 
and 
environment, 

oversees the transition team. He 
said the team has five main tasks 
starting with increasing faculty 
involvement 
across 
different 

schools at the University and 
focusing on identifying faculty — 
those who are currently affiliated 
with SNRE and those who are 
not — who might be interested in 
being part of the new school.

“One part of the vision for 

this is that faculty in units from 
around campus will keep their 
positions where they are, but take 
partial positions in the new school 
and so the faculty transition team 
is tasked with thinking about how 
that might work,” Brown said.

The other tasks deal with 

the inner and outer workings 
of the school, focusing on the 
development of the program’s 
structure. 
The 
committee 

suggested organizing the new 
school around themes, or problem 
areas 
in 
environment 
and 

sustainability, Brown said, adding 
that the faculty transition team 
aims to “implement a process for 
identifying themes” and define 
function and governance.

“The fourth thing is to identify 

opportunities and proposals for 
curricular innovations in the new 
school — make recommendations, 
essentially — for what kinds 
of programs the new school 
should be offering, and thinking 
about that very innovatively and 
creatively in terms of online, living 
laboratories, undergrad and grad 
combined 
programs, 
potential 

changes 
to 
the 
professional 

program,” he said. “The fifth thing 
is to identify the administrative 
and governance processes for the 
new school: For example, coming 
up with some bylaws that would 
help launch the new school.”

Fifteen faculty will serve on the 

transition team, which will start 
meeting Thursday. Bill Currie, 
chair of the New School Faculty 
Transition Team and School of 
Natural 
Resources 
professor, 

said there are plans in the works 
to add two student members and 
the team will create additional 
mechanisms for student input in 
the future.

Pollack 
emphasized 
that 

faculty from a wide array of 
colleges and programs at the 
University have been included in 

the committee, in alignment with 
the multidisciplinary approach of 
the school.

“The 
whole 
goal 
of 
what 

we’re trying to do is to bring 
together 
people 
from 
across 

boundaries from across campus,” 
she 
said. 
“Sustainability 
and 

the environment are areas in 
which you need to have multiple 
perspectives. You need not just 
the perspective of science and 
social science, but you need 
the humanities, and you need 
engineering and you need public 
health and on and on.”

Currie 
noted 
that 
while 

the 
school 
may 
faces 
some 

issues in integrating different 
backgrounds, current issues in 
sustainability need to be tackled 
through the lenses of many 
different disciplines.

“The problems that we face in 

sustainability — things like clean 
energy, food security, climate 
change, land use change, water 
quality — these environmental 
issues have gotten to the point 
where they cannot be solved 
in just one discipline,” he said. 
“In 
fact, 
sustainability 
deals 

with something called ‘wicked 
problems,’ which the definition is 
that they are large and complex 
and across disciplines, and people 
don’t even agree on the statement 
of the problem. So these are really 
challenging problems to work on, 
and we need people from different 
disciplines.”

He added that the most difficult 

task the transition team will 
have is figuring out how to get 
the campus community to think 
about 
sustainability 
and 
the 

environment 
differently 
than 

they have before, emphasizing 
the 
importance 
of 
fostering 

innovative thought within the 
discipline.

“Professors and administrators 

at the University tend to be really 
accustomed to working in their 
own disciplines, and getting them 
to think in bold and innovative 
ways, what can we really do 
differently, (is) going to be a big 
challenge,” 
Currie 
said. 
“But 

everyone that I’ve talked to on 
the committee is excited about 
thinking about what we can do 
along those lines. So we’re excited 
about it, but it’s still going to be a 
tough job.”

Brown said he hopes the new 

school can bridge together the 
different 
sustainability 
and 

environmental 
programs 
that 

currently exist to establish the 
University as a leader in the field. 
Currently, the University has 
programs including conservation 
ecology 
and 
sustainability 

systems.

“The biggest goal is that we, 

as a university, pool together the 
dispersed assets that we have 
for scholarship and education in 
environment and sustainability, 
coordinate those more carefully, 
and 
collaborate 
more 
closely 

around campus to elevate our 
ability to provide ongoing and 
stronger 
leadership 
… 
and 

ultimately to become a category 
leader in offering environment 
and 
sustainability 
programs,” 

Brown said.

SUSTAINABILITY

S

exual assault happens, 
and that’s what matters, 
not 
when, 
where 
or 

how. 
The 
sobriety 
of 
the 

victim 
doesn’t 
matter, 
nor 

does his or her race, gender or 
socioeconomic class.

All that matters is that it 

happens. 

Two years ago, it happened 

to me.

I was pushed up against a 

wall, choked and raped for 
the first time when I was 16 
years old. For over a year, I 
didn’t tell a soul, because there 
was always the chance my 
perpetrator would fulfill his 
threats and harm my family. 
The fear that stemmed from 
those threats, coupled with the 
fervent denial I experienced 
after the fact, influenced me 
to numbly trudge forward in 
life, desperately seeking any 
distraction that could allow me 
to forget it ever happened.

For a long time, that was all I 

wanted: to forget, and to pretend 
like it never happened at all.

For 
months 
afterward, 
I 

thought 
that 
strength 
and 

resilience 
were 
manifested 

in the ability to nonchalantly 
“brush off” tragedy, like flicking 
away a piece of lint. I became 
consumed with the notion that 
to be strong meant to “suck it 
up,” and to get on with life. I 
desperately wanted to move 
forward and to “get over it” 
as soon as possible, because I 
wanted to stop suffering from 
the fear, guilt, anger, confusion 
and pain. I wanted so badly for 
my life could go back to the way 
it used to be. 

Unsurprisingly, my life did 

not go back to the way it was 
before I was raped. And, like 
almost all things in life, brushing 
off the pain and sucking it up are 
all insurmountably easier said 
than done.

I tried, though. I would wake 

up in the morning with my face 
wet with tears, clean myself up 
and fake a smile. I would then 
proceed through school hiding 
behind a veil of superficial 
euphoria and fake even more 
smiles to friends and teachers. 
I had to do so, because I didn’t 
want them to suspect that 
anything was wrong — because 
I wanted to be “normal.”

Only when I went home, 

utterly exhausted, would I shut 
myself in my room, allow a 
day’s worth of suppressed pain 

to rip my chest open and cry. 
Not until I quietly wept myself 
senseless could I finally begin 
my homework.

When night came, I would 

turn off the light and go to bed, 
only to wake up from vivid 
nightmares of being touched 
where I don’t want to be. My 
bedroom would be dark, and I 
would feel his presence in my 
room, hiding in the darkness, 
waiting to pounce. To fall back 
asleep, I would have to turn 
on my bedside lamp and allow 
my entire room to be basked in 
light. I would then frantically 
look around to make sure I was, 
indeed, safe, and there was 
nobody else in my room, only to 
wake up the next morning with 
my face wet with tears yet again.

Ever since, I haven’t been able 

to sleep alone in a room without 
the light on.

It took me a long time to 

finally stop convincing myself 
that I could live as though it 
never happened. Not until after 
I suffered numerous crippling 
panic attacks did I finally 
stop running away from my 
memories. As months of pent-
up pain and anger gradually 
overcame me, seeping through 
every cell in my body until I 
was completely consumed by 
them, I sometimes became 
uncontrollably angry. I would 
be angry at him, but I was 
mostly furious at myself for 
still being so affected by the 
aftermath and for still feeling 
so helpless and broken.

Slowly, my anger morphed 

into envy. I would see all of 
these strong, beautiful survivors 
who were so open about their 
assaults, and who were not only 
supportive of fellow survivors 
but also of themselves. I would 

see 
Instagram 
photos 
of 

survivors looking strong, happy 
and whole at “saPAC the Diag” 
while holding “I love consent” 
and “yes means yes” signs. All I 
could selfishly think about was 
how I wish I could be whole like 
them. Those incredible people 
had all dug themselves out of 
their dark holes, but I was still 
stuck deep inside of mine, when 
all I wanted was to be free.

I deeply regret allowing my 

envy to drive me to become 
verbally violent. I’m ashamed 
to have often been blinded by 
the jealousy and anger coursing 
through my veins, to have 
verbally attacked the people 
who were just trying to support 
me and help me through the 
pain. You know who you are, 
and I need you to know how 
unbelievably sorry I am.

I 
realize 
now 
that 
the 

aforementioned 
incredible 

people hadn’t dug themselves 
out of their dark holes after 
all, but rather they had found 
caring and supportive people 
to help pull them out. The 
endless love and support that 
my friends and family provide 
are the reasons why I am no 
longer stuck in that dark place. 
I’ve learned that hurdling over 
painful events without a second 
glance isn’t possible, because 
the pain will inevitably sneak 
back up once more to haunt 
you. I’ve also learned that 
strength and courage don’t 
stem from the ability to forget 
and brush off pain. Strength 
comes, instead, from those 
willing to share the pain so it’s 
no longer completely on your 
shoulders. It comes from those 
who love and support you.

While opening up has been 

a brutal, scary and exhausting 
process, I’m relieved to finally 
be whole enough to do so, 
thanks to the loved ones who 
have patiently helped me piece 
myself back together. I’m a 
survivor, but because of the 
support system that I’ve been 
so fortunate to find, I am no 
longer simply surviving.

I’m living.
And that’s what matters.

Strength in sharing

 
Let’s not talk about politics

CLARISSA DONNELLY-DEROVEN | COLUMN

W

hen 
I 
studied 

abroad 
in 
Buenos 

Aires, 
Argentina 

last winter, the weirdest thing 
I was asked the most about was 
not why did we carve former 
presidents’ faces into a mountain, 
which I’m still wondering about 
myself, 
but 
rather 

why 
was 
a 
piece 

of 
orange 
human 

garbage 
winning 

the 
Republican 

presidential 
nomination: 
“¿¡Por 

qué todos los yankees 
les gusta a Donald 
Trump?!”

One night, before 

Bernie Sanders had 
officially 
lost 
the 

primary, I was out 
at a bar with two of 
my friends and my 
friend’s sister who was visiting. 
A group of guys kept asking us 
to join our table and though 
we ignored them for a while, 
we eventually obliged. I can’t 
remember why, probably because 
in terms of loud men who harass 
women until we talk to them, 
they seemed pretty mild.

One guy asked us who we 

were voting for, we all said 
Bernie Sanders, and then the 
guy hugged us all and assured 
us he, too, would vote for Bernie 
Sanders if given the choice. 
He pointed at himself, “Yo, yo 
apoyo a Bernie Sanders, pero él,” 
he pointed at his friend, “¡Este 
hombre apoyo a Donald Trump!” 
Aside from our President Macri-
loving host moms and the one 
anti-refugee German my friend 
went on a date with, most of 
us only knew porteños more 

Marxist than us, so we cried out, 
“¿¡POR QUE?!”

This 
boy 
explained 
how 

he was sick of Peruvians and 
Bolivians 
— 
aka 
indigenous 

people — coming into Argentina 
and using their public health 
care and universities, both of 

which are legally free 
for Argentines and 
foreigners. My friend 
Abby turned to the 
Bernie-supporting 
friend and asked what 
seemed like a logical 
question: “How are 
you guys friends? Do 
you ever fight? Like … 
pelear? Luchar?” He 
laughed at our violent 
Yankee 
naïveté, 

“¡Jajaja! 
¿¡Pelear?! 

¿¡Luchar?! ¡No!” Then 
he said the Spanish 

equivalent of “We talk, we argue 
and then we get drunk.”

The two main things I learned 

on my first day in Buenos Aires 
were: 1. All porteños go to 
therapy, and 2. Talking about 
politics isn’t off limits. I think 
these two things are related, 
but I don’t know that I’ll get to 
that analysis. What I will say is: 
Try talking about politics in the 
United States and you’ll quickly 
be hushed and met with whines 
of “can’t we talk about something 
more pleasant?” I don’t know 
how 
or 
why 
this 
cultural 

difference sprouted, perhaps it 
has something to do with living 
under various dictatorships that 
makes people realize that politics 
can’t be separated from everyday 
life, or perhaps it’s something 
else. Regardless, my issue is that 
in the United States we think we 

cannot talk about politics, but I 
argue: That’s impossible.

In the United States, we have 

a weird definition of politics. 
When we talk about “politics,” 
we talk about politicians, what’s 
happening 
in 
Washington, 

etc. We don’t actually talk 
about policies. And that’s not 
our fault: The image that’s 
been constructed for us of 
what “politics” is also doesn’t 
discuss 
policies. 
Example: 

the presidential debate. The 
debates are not about substance, 
they’re about creating personas 
of Donald and Hillary: our 
symbols of “politics.” Thus, 
when we talk about “politics,” 
we’re not actually talking about 
anything substantive — we’re 
talking about a performance, a 
false and constructed image of a 
thing, a spectacle.

When we talk about “politics” 

only as it relates to Donald 
and 
Hillary, 
our 
political 

consciousness 
neither 
exists 

nor has opinions of its own: It’s 
entirely created by and wrapped 
up in the being of our politicians’ 
personas and the language of 
their campaigns. When people 
say “make America great again,” 
they don’t mean anything. When 
people say “stronger together,” 
they don’t mean anything. Our 
political campaigns don’t mean 
anything. They are marketing 
campaigns. 
They 
make 
up 

slogans.

T

wo weeks ago, as I 
stood in the press pen 
of the Trump rally held 

in Novi, Mich., I listened to 
the delegation of nationalist 
chauvinists adorned in “Make 
America 
Great 

Again” memorabilia 
scream out factually 
inept rhetoric. I saw 
people 
who 
were 

there to see their 
interpretation of the 
savior for the “real” 
America 
deliver 

his 
all-too-familiar 

stump 
speech 
on 

the 
failures 
of 

Democrats 
and 

the evils of Hillary Clinton. 
At one point, I glanced off to 
my left and spotted a young 
boy sitting on the fence that 
divided the press from the 
general crowd. His father held 
him securely, balancing him 
on the fence — and from the 
look on the boy’s face, he was 
having an incredible time. I 
was drawn to his look of pure 
enjoyment and curiosity of the 
dramatic political rally he was 
at. Everyone around him was 
excited, smiling, cheering and 
extremely energized — until he 
looked at me.

And as soon as my brain 

registered the fact that he was 
smiling at me, something took 
over. I was instantly upset 
over seeing a child at a Trump 
rally attempting to share his 
happy experience with me in a 
friendly manner. So, I decided 
— in all my pessimistic glory — 

to use every muscle in my face 
to deliver one of the darkest 
and most disgusted looks ever 
given from one fellow human 
being to another. And as my 
brow dramatically furrowed 

and my eyes shaded 
over in a blind rage, 
the smile on his lips 
slowly disappeared. 
And then he cried. 
He 
cried 
because 

he 
was 
visibly 

disturbed 
at 
the 

fact that someone 
could look so upset 
at what he thought 
was a happy event. 
A look that was able 

to penetrate the most innocent 
and undisturbed regions of 
his psyche that had yet to be 
corrupted from the outside. So 
he cried and then I felt like shit.

Naturally 
the 
immediate 

aftershock 
of 
my 
horribly 

inappropriate 
and 
cruel 

action hit me and led me to 
believe that maybe having the 
pettiness and immaturity to 
suddenly desire to ruin a little 
boy’s day just because I did not 
like the fact that he was happy 
was probably a testament to 
some 
grander 
underlying, 

psychological problems that 
I have. But that’s not how 
I’m deciding to interpret this 
event. Because I believe that 
the moment I decided to make 
a 5-year-old cry was the tipping 
point of the compounded level 
of disgust and disdain I have 
had for this moment within 
American politics.

For nearly a year and a half, I 

have vehemently condemned the 
Trump campaign for bringing 
such deplorable rhetoric to the 
national level. And in addition, I 
have condemned the GOP for not 
only creating the environment 
for this rogue campaign, but also 
for then continuing to endorse it 
through all of the all the racism, 
xenophobia and other disturbing 
content. I have followed this 
campaign through its entirety 
and have been disgusted with 
the 
factually 
inept 
policy 

planning, the blatantly illegal 
and unconstitutional proposals, 
the lack of decency and empathy. 
I had hoped that the GOP could 
kill this cancer that has infected 
their 162-year-old party. Yet, 
I placed too much faith in a 
political institution that would 
place party ahead of politics.

All of these feelings and 

opinions that had culminated 
within me came pouring out 
when I saw the innocent face 
of this boy who was so easily 
being impressed upon by the 
rally occurring around him. I 
became unbelievably upset due 
to the fact that this 5-year-old’s 
father decided that a political 
rally for a candidate who mocks 
reporters with disabilities and 
brags about sexually assaulting 
women would be an appropriate 
place to bring his child. And 
those compounded emotions 
and opinions that were all 
being restrained during my 
hour within the press pen came 
pouring out in an invisible 
stream of abomination directed 

toward the soul of an innocent 
5-year-old boy who was just 
being friendly.

Of course I feel terrible for 

doing this. Honestly, I saw a 
little bit of myself in that boy. 
Not only did he physically 
resemble a younger me, but I 
remember the blind degree of 
optimism and positive curiosity 
I once had toward the world. 
But I am oddly proud I did this. 
Even though I may have aged 
his little soul by about five or 
six years, I hopefully imprinted 
a relevant memory of sadness 
and confusion on him that I 
believe is beneficial.

Hopefully, when he recalls 

smiling at me, he’ll understand 
that I was unhappy because I 
knew something he didn’t. I 
knew something his invincible 
dad did not teach him. I knew 
why he shouldn’t have been 
smiling, let alone been at such a 
political event. And I hope that 
one day, years from now, when 
he opens a history book — after 
a successful eight years of the 
Hillary Clinton administration 
— he will read a chapter on the 
2016 election. In it he will read 
about the ridiculous candidacy 
of Trump and the even more 
ridiculous political party that 
lacked the character to stand 
up to him. And then he will 
understand why the hell I made 
him cry. You’re welcome, kid.

I hate Donald Trump with a burning passion

TV REVIEW

Riding on the success of “Mr. 

Robot,” USA has delivered a new 
series that capitalizes on the 
same eerie sweet 
spots of the net-
work’s 
break-out 

hit. From produc-
er Gale Anne Hurd 
of “The Walking 
Dead” comes sci-
ence-fiction thrill-
er “Falling Water,” 
where dreams are 
not random mani-
festations of the 
subconscious but, 
instead, fated to reveal a world-
shattering truth. The premiere 
offers a first taste of the mys-
tery that promises to unravel 
throughout the season and sets 
up potential for the the series to 
become remorselessly addictive.

Three seemingly unrelated 

individuals are connected by 
their 
dreams, 
each 
holding 

answers to the others’ recurring 
subconscious 
improvisations. 

The premiere first introduces 
Tess (Lizzie Brocheré, “The 
Wedding Song”), a trendspotter 
looking for the next big thing, 
who dreams of a son she does 
not remember having. She is 
sought out by Bill Boerg (Zak 
Orth, “Wet Hot American Sum-

mer”), a scientist whose inter-
est in her dreams are shady at 
best. Bill promises Tess answers 
about her son if she cooperates 
with his experiments, in which 
he asks her to walk into other’s 

subconsciouses. 
Interwoven with 
Tess’s story are 
corporate 
busi-

nessman 
Burton 

(David Ajala, “The 
Dark 
Knight”), 

who dreams of an 
elusive 
Woman 

in Red, and Taka 
(Will 
Yun 
Lee, 

“The Wolverine”), 
a detective with 

horrific dreams of his catatonic 
mother. 

It’s nearly impossible to dif-

ferentiate between their reality 
and sleep, as the pilot waltzes 
in and out of the vivid dreams 
of the three main protagonists. 
The 
storyline 
is 
purposely 

constructed to be convoluted; 
perhaps the difficult to follow 
plot intends to trick the audi-
ence into sticking around for 
some answers. But confusion 
breeds frustration in a restless 
audience, and nobody is going 
to wait around too long before 
completely giving up on a direc-
tionless story. “Falling Water” 
runs the risk of alienation in a 
premiere so oversaturated with 

questions that even the audience 
doesn’t know what’s real and 
what’s not. 

Comparable to “Mr. Robot” 

in look and feel, “Falling Water” 
is visually intriguing from the 
opening sequence. The series 
stays true to a consistent aes-
thetic: muted colors and an 
eerily silent soundtrack blan-
ket the screen as the characters 
move through a cold, urban set-
ting. A few thematic elements 
make frequent appearances; for 
example, running water, often 
played in reverse, recurs in both 
the protagonists’ dreams and 
realities, perhaps to provide an 
origin to root the show’s title. 
Yet there is a great deal of inno-
vation and versatility in the 
visual construction, as lighting 
and shadows create personality 
in a show that is objectively col-
ored by grays and diluted tones. 
In fact, most of the pivotal plot 
points lie in the visuals rather 
than extensive dialogue or nar-
ration.

While the series may be con-

fusing narratively, it’s far from 
boring, allowing the cinematog-
raphy to tell most of the story 
instead of the screenplay. So if 
the audience can stay engaged 
long enough for “Falling Water” 
to establish solid footing, USA 
might have a new hit on its 
hands.

USA’s ‘Falling Water’ narratively 
sinks, but aesthetically stays afloat

DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Two Door Cinema Club have 

always been a band known for 
their originality. I remember 
hearing 
“Ciga-

rettes In The The-
atre” for the first 
time and thinking, 
“WOW! This is 
something 
really 

special!” Yet, their 
newest offspring, 
Gameshow, comes 
off like Saint Motel 
and Daft Punk had 
a child that grew 
up to be exceptionally boring. 
The album does little to show-
case their prior penchant for 
soaring, enticing guitar melodies 
and catchy synth hooks, replac-
ing them with a more standard 
techno vibe.

Two Door’s debut album, 

Tourist History, was a defini-
tive album in my love affair with 
music, but Gameshow snuffs out 
that flame under bass-heavy 
beats and frankly unoriginal mel-
odies in context of what can be 
expected from Two Door’s music. 
The music itself isn’t horrendous, 
but its lack of characteristic flair 
causes the album to fall flat from 
the band’s past electricity.

A fairly blatant detriment to 

the album is its length. The deluxe 
edition is over an hour long, with 
the inclusion of two remixes and 
a live recording, and a majority of 

the tracks feel like they overstay 
their welcome. Lengthy portions 
of songs seemed like they were 
written with the intent of forcing 
concertgoers to dance at a perfor-

mance, and not to 
enjoy on their lone-
some with a record-
ing. If anything, the 
duration 
created 

confusion 
during 

my 
first 
listen, 

and then just pure 
boredom and frus-
tration on my sub-
sequent attempts to 
enjoy it.

“I’m a present danger to my 

health,” 
sings 
Alex 
Trimble 

on the opening notes of “Good 
Morning,” in true summation of 
the album. He sings of contradic-
tions that are perfectly analo-
gous to my experience with this 
album: conflicted feelings of con-
fusion and desire to thoroughly 
enjoy my listen. Yet, the track 
only calls to mind Two Door’s 
past glory; it’s indicative of their 
previous sound while coming 
across as outdated in today’s 
indie music scene.

The album burns slowly, and 

few songs are able to truly hold 
attention or emotional invest-
ment for longer than a minute, 
which makes the inclusion and 
placement of the last two tracks 
even more confounding. “Gaso-
line” and “Sucker” close out the 
album, one of the most artistical-

ly befuddling choices I’ve heard 
in music. Both are strange and 
slow, leaving literally nothing but 
a bad taste in the listener’s mouth. 
It really causes the album to lack 
a reasonable sense of closure.

However, Two Door doesn’t 

totally fail on every track. Title 
track “Gameshow” blurs the line 
between indie and rock, provid-
ing a much needed incidence of 
vocal and instrumental variation. 
Trimble desparately shouts, “Just 
give me something, anything to 
live by / my blood is pumping so 
fast I forgot why I try.” It feels 
like a cathartic release among the 
relative normativity of the rest of 
the album. Another solid track is 
“Je Viens De La.” It’s similar to 
the classic Two Door tone, and 
brings back the much needed 
fire that characterizes their most 
successful creations. Its chorus 
is shrill and captivating, and the 
track isn’t long enough to make 
me want to hit the skip button.

Gameshow, despite its spar-

ing highlights, feels like a let-
down. Individually, the tracks 
aren’t terrible, but as a collective 
album, it induces a confusing, 
underwhelming listen. Gone are 
the days of the tight pop tracks 
on Tourist History, along with 
the incredible songwriting on 
“Changing of the Seasons,” one 
of the best indie tracks from this 
decade. Two Door set their bar 
too high for their third album to 
be a true success.

N

othing ever ends when 
it’s supposed to. Espe-
cially not movies.

Last weekend, the lovely 

and talented Community Cul-
ture Edi-
tor, Natalie 
Zak, and I 
went to see 
“American 
Honey.” 
We tucked 
the outing 
neatly in 
between 
dinner and 
an evening 
of singing 
Alanis Morissette at Circus. 
We never made it to Circus, 
however, because “American 
Honey” refused to end.

Around the two-hour mark, 

I sat in the theater fidgeting 
and doing something I (almost) 
never do — covertly checking 
the time on my phone.

“American Honey” felt like it 

was slowly ghosting me toward 
our end. It wasn’t going to 
come right out and dump me, 
instead it was going to spiral 
towards the end, suggesting a 
million points of closure and 
choosing instead to continue on 
despite them. That’s what made 
it so painful: its repetition of 
signs my movie-saturated brain 
recognizes as ending. Some-
thing dramatic and conclusive 
happens, the music swells and 
the camera lingers on some 
object of symbolic significance. 
Then, cut to black and roll the 
credits, right? Wrong.

Even when it did decide 

to end, within the context of 
its scene, it was too late. Star 
wades into the water — a clear 
callback to an earlier scene 
and a symbolic rebirth — she 
submerges and then bursts out, 
her hair arching dramatically 
overhead. That’s the end of the 
movie, but it’s not its ending. 
Instead, the camera lingers on 
the surface of the water and 
the moonlight catching on the 
trees. This return to stillness 
takes away from the power and 
movement created earlier in 
the scene.

In my film class last week, 

we were discussing “Shaw-
shank Redemption” and some-
one pointed out that it too ends 
after it ought to. It should have 

ended with hope — the driving 
emotion of the movie — in the 
form of Red riding in the bus, 
going up a hill on the other side 
of which the audience can only 
imagine is Andy and freedom 
and, you guessed it, redemp-
tion. But, instead, the camera 
follow Red there. We watch 
him get to Mexico and reunite 
with Andy. The film closes 
itself up neatly, so neatly in 
fact, that there is no room for 
lingering emotion. The hope of 
resolution is much more pow-
erful than resolution itself. In 
the world of the movie, once 
the two men are reunited, 
there is nothing left for the 
audience to want.

So many movies fall victim 

to the too perfect ending. Even 
my beloved “Heathers” is not 
immune. Instead of leaving 
Veronica covered in ash with 
a cigarette hanging out of her 
mouth — by far the standout 
visual moment of the movie 
— we have to follow her back 
into the school so she can make 
nice with Martha Dumptruck 
and reaffirm her status as 
the “nice” one. Much like in 
“American Honey” or “Shaw-
shank,” the movement away 
from the dramatic moment 
breaks the emotional spell that 
scene creates.

Maybe it’s because endings 

are the most artificial part of 
movies, of any type of story-
telling. They’re so hard to get 
right because there’s no real 
world model for how to do 
it. In life there are very few 
— maybe, depending on how 
much you like to overthink, 
no — things that end like the 
ending of a movie. Moments 
slip into one another in a messy 
and overlapping web. Noth-
ing really begins or ends, but 
rather continues.

Sometimes that endlessness 

is really frustrating. I think 
what frustrated me and Natalie 
so much about the slow death 
of “American Honey” was its 
resemblance to real life. It, like 
most ex-boyfriends, refused to 
let us go. It did the film equiva-
lent of texting us right when 
we were finally almost getting 
over it. It was so frustratingly 
realistic.

It refused to give into the 

artificiality of endings. Its 

length seemed to suggest that 
it equally could have ended 
at any point or not at all. The 
moment of conclusion was arbi-
trary. Because it wasn’t a story 
of something; it was a story 
about something. A something 
that stems from, and likewise 
flows into, a thousand other 
somethings without a clear 
beginning or end.

I’m glad Natalie and I — 

unlike some of our fellow mov-
iegoers — made it to the end. 
It was a challenge. “American 
Honey” tested our patience 
with an annoying lead, a grimy 
setting and Shia LaBeouf’s 
braided rattail (*gag*).

I’m not glad I made it to the 

ending because Star’s moment 
of self-baptism was particu-
larly revelatory or original, 
but because it wasn’t. It ended 
as silently as moments in life 
normally do, each one fading 
into the next. Its mundanity 
highlighted the construction, 
the falsity, of endings.

Nothing ever ends when 

it’s supposed to because noth-
ing ever truly ends. Someone 
much wiser than me once told 
me that it is impossible for the 
people we care about to leave 
our lives forever. Mortality 
aside, I’m beginning to under-
stand what she was saying. 
Sometimes it’s a text from an 
ex, a sweet email from your 
high school art teacher or a 
kid handing out fliers in the 
Diag who you swear you met 
at a party once freshman year. 
Nothing really ends — it only 
changes, becoming something 
new.

So although I had to spend 

almost three hours watching a 
movie where Shia LaBeouf had 
a rattail and missed singing 
“Ironic” with my Alanis-loving 
gal pals, I’m glad “American 
Honey” did what it did. I’m 
glad it frustrated me and made 
me fidget. Because it proved 
to me that the storyteller — 
regardless of the expectation’s 
of their audience — has power 
over when to end their story, 
if ever.

you of the mess you left when

“Don’t ask me what’s on fleek.”
‘Insecure’ is a hilarious 
take on identity, romance

Issa Rae is a ray of sunshine in HBO’s new true-to-life series

Looking through the stock of 

new TV shows entering the fall 
season, a growing pattern of 
shows about race, 
specifically about 
the 
contempo-

rary Black expe-
rience, seems to 
be present. FX’s 
“Atlanta,” OWN’s 
“Queen 
Sugar” 

and 
Netflix’s 

“Luke Cage” are 
three such exam-
ples that not only 
showcase 
more 

representation for 
Black actors, but 
also address issues 
the Black commu-
nity often faces, including police 
brutality, marginalization and 
socioeconomic status. But while 
those topics are illustrated in 
rather serious settings (“Atlan-
ta” is a slight exception), HBO’s 
newest 
comedy, 
“Insecure,” 

proves that issues concerning 
the Black community, specifical-
ly Black women, can still be just 
as thought provoking when told 
through a comedic lens.

At the helm of “Insecure” is 

writer-actress Issa Rae, who 
co-created the show with Larry 
Wilmore of Comedy Central’s 
sadly defunct “The Nightly Show 
with Larry Wilmore.” Though 
Rae is a relatively new voice on 
American television, she has 
been slowly making her way to 
stardom since 2011. Her cult 
YouTube series, “Awkward Black 
Girl,” displayed Rae’s unique life 
experiences, from her awkward 
dates, to job hunting, to sim-
ply living as a Black woman in 
America. Ultimately, “Awkward 
Black Girl” would become the 
basis for “Insecure,” and thanks 
to better production values pro-
vided by HBO, “Insecure” picks 
up where “Awkward Black Girl” 
left off — and then some.

Featuring an incredible come-

dic cast, razor-sharp writing, 
crisp cinematography and a phe-
nomenal soundtrack, Rae and 
Wilmore’s “Insecure” gets the 
“Master of None” treatment: it’s 
a comedy that’s both relatable 

and distinctive, weaving a tight-
knit thread between universality 
and specificity. While it subtly 
tackles office discrimination and 
microaggressions, 
“Insecure” 

also 
explores 
the 
complex-

ity 
of 
Black 

female friendship, 
romance, 
self-

identity and the 
existential 
dread 

of being in your 
late 20s. In addi-
tion to conveying 
more representa-
tion of people of 
color, 
“Insecure” 

expertly excels at 
subverting expec-
tations and stereo-
types about Black 
people 
through 

Rae’s 
three-

dimensional depictions of her 
characters.

In the show, Rae plays Issa 

Dee, a driven yet self-conscious 
Los Angeles woman who deals 
with her everyday anxiety by 
rapping in front of the bathroom 
mirror. As the only Black woman 
working at a nonprofit organi-
zation helping underprivileged 
children, Issa can’t help but 
recognize her voicelessness and 
token presence among her pre-
dominantly white co-workers.

At one point, Issa directly 

points out some of this discom-
fort, when her co-worker Kitty 
(Veronica Mannion, “American 
Horror Story”) negligibly asks 
her, “What’s on fleek?” “I don’t 
know what that means,” Issa 
responds 
passive-aggressively, 

but through voiceover, she really 
tells us what’s on her mind: “I 
know what that shit means.”

Simultaneously, 
Issa 
has 

trouble confronting her dead-
beat, long-term boyfriend Law-
rence (Jay Ellis, “Movie 43”) 
about where they’re headed as a 
couple. After her recently single 
high school crush Daniel (Y’lan 
Noel, “The Hustle”) comes back 
into the picture, Issa must decide 
whether or not her love for Law-
rence is enough to keep their 
relationship moving forward. 

Meanwhile, Issa’s best friend 

Molly 
(newcomer 
Yvonne 

Orji) is living quite the oppo-
site experience to Issa. She’s a 

hot-shot success and adored by 
her multiracial co-workers at 
her corporate law agency, but 
she struggles to find a signifi-
cant other in the dating scene, 
especially when her office mate 
becomes engaged.

Molly and Issa’s relationship, 

while volatile at times, feels 
realistic as any best friendship 
would; the two exchange funny 
anecdotes and entangle them-
selves in screaming matches, 
but at the end of the day, Issa 
and Molly find a way to make 
up. And what feels so refreshing 
about this particular friendship 
in “Insecure” is that it doesn’t 
reflect the frequently negative 
depictions of Black women often 
seen in reality shows or melodra-
mas. It simply illustrates the two 
as modern day working women 
with a fun-loving, dysfunctional 
relationship.

The mirror rap sequences 

in “Insecure” provide much of 
the show’s laughs as a storytell-
ing device, replacing “Awkward 
Black Girl” ’s flashbacks and 
first-person voiceover. But these 
sequences 
also 
demonstrate 

Issa’s conviction to individual-
ity, both as a writer and as an 
actress. As she gets ready for a 
night out with Molly in the pilot, 
she tries on a variety of lipsticks 
during a gut-busting montage, 
with each lipstick represent-
ing a different identity of Black 
women. However, in the end, 
Issa opts for plain lip balm, sig-
nifying that the most attractive, 
interesting person she can be is 
herself.

Through all its unabashed 

raunchiness and socially con-
scious themes, “Insecure” is a 
blessing for Issa Rae fans, as well 
as a pleasant surprise for novices 
to her work. Rae and Wilmore 
have effortlessly blended the 
modern-day Black experience 
with an enlightening, vulgar and 
captivating story about a woman 
entering a transitional period 
in her adult life. The show cer-
tainly spins themes similar to 
other 
character-driven 
com-

edies about living in your 20s, 
but “Insecure” proves that these 
kinds of stories can be just as 
compelling with more diverse 
voices.

TV REVIEW

Watching “American Honey” 

feels like getting a personal invi-
tation to the feral, cross-country 
van party that 
exists at the cen-
ter of the film. 
The 
audience 

acts as a fly on 
the wall, privy 
to the runaway 
subculture’s 
breathtaking 
highs and dev-
astating lows. Without knowing 
much about the characters, we 
develop an easy intimacy with 
them that magnetizes their every 
movement.

The film introduces protago-

nist Star (newcomer Sasha Lane) 
dumpster diving with her two 
young siblings. She takes care of 
them for her deadbeat parents and 
has way too much responsibility 
for the 18 years that she claims she 
is. So when opportunity, dressed 
as Shia LaBouef (“Fury”) with a 
rattail braid, comes knocking, she 
follows.

Star meets the charismatic Jake 

(LaBouef) at a Wal-Mart, gyrat-
ing during the Rihanna song “We 
Found Love.” He invites her to 
join his group, selling magazines 
across the country in a white 
van. From the moment she says 
yes, the film becomes a sprawl-
ing episodic adventure with a 
disjointed and random plot. This 
is not a movie that obeys the laws 
of screenwriting — what happens 

is not the point. Director Andrea 
Arnold (“Wuthering Heights”) 
doesn’t care about chronological 
sense or the passage of time. The 
editing is similarly carefree and 
nonchalant, vacillating between 

languid 
dreaminess 

and accelerated, anx-
ious pacing. Fascinat-
ed by the minuscule, 
the camera lingers 
unnervingly on shots 
of nature and insects, 
rather than the char-
acters 
themselves. 

Arnold isn’t worried 

about plot, but is preoccupied by 
the way she can make your heart 
plummet and soar with a single 
image of a bee flitting across the 
screen.

The other members of the team, 

most of whom are not professional 
actors, serve mostly as vessels 
onto which we can project our 
own neuroses. None are as terrify-
ing or compelling as the ringleader 
of the ‘mag crew,’ Krystal, played 
curtly by Riley Keough (Elvis Pre-
sley’s granddaughter; “Mad Max: 
Fury Road”). Although she never 
fully opens her eyes, Krystal has 
complete control over everyone 
around her. 

The film’s minor characters 

exist alongside Star, in the van and 
on the streets of suburbia peddling 
magazines, but do not receive the 
same backstory she does. And yet, 
they are not incomplete — we get 
small fragments of identity from 
them in their dance moves or pro-
pensity for flashing. They are not 
fully fleshed out, permitting the 

audience to play a hand in con-
structing identity and emotionally 
expanding the plot.

Because so much of the film 

takes place in the van, the dynam-
ic and wavering nature of the 
soundtrack anchors the audience 
in time and space. The limited 
setting of the van, packed with 
pierced, tattooed flesh squeezed 
into Daisy Dukes, feels inescap-
able, with music serving as the 
only outlet. The melodies rever-
berate in our memories, a sense of 
déjà vu washing over us every time 
the radio is sporadically turned 
on. When the titular “Ameri-
can Honey” by Lady Antebellum 
comes on and the whole van sings 
along, it feels genuine and heart-
wrenching in a way that could 
have been kitschy in the hands of 
a less competent director.

It’s fair to say that on a whole, 

the multiplicity of the film could 
not have been done by anyone 
but Arnold. The camera exam-
ines Star’s exploration into her 
sexuality in both upsetting and 
loving situations. It could have 
easily turned into a cautionary tale 
of young girls going into cars with 
strange men, but remained a story 
of adventure and growing up.

“American 
Honey” 
viscer-

ally understands the terrain of 
its lens. It doesn’t shy away from 
stereotypes or ugliness, because 
it knows what is there. But it also 
captures raw, gut-wrenching pro-
files of people mostly ignored by 
society, making the film and its 
characters impossible to get out of 
your head.

‘American Honey’ invites you on a 
fascinating, unconventional journey

Number-loving, nerdy, inge-

nious and socially awkward are 
not typical characteristics of 
a trained assas-
sin. On top of this 
unconventionality, 
picture a bulked 
up, 
hunky 
Ben 

Affleck (“Batman v 
Superman”) emu-
lating these traits 
while 
accurately 

firing a sniper and 
snapping 
necks 

with 
ease. 
The 

idea that a literal 
accountant, a job typically not 
glorified in action movies, is 
capable of Jason Bourne-esque 
fighting capabilities is hilari-
ous. Everyone knows a real life 
accountant, and they are likely 
not the first person to come to 
mind when thinking of a possible 
action movie star. Essentially, 
this is what makes “The Accoun-
tant” entertaining, but mostly 
hard to grasp.

Gavin O’Connor’s (“Warrior”) 

“The Accountant” focuses on a 
rogue accountant — or rather, 
hitman — hired by criminal 
enterprises. The plot thickens 
once he is pursued in a cat and 
mouse chase by the U.S. Trea-
sury Department. Although it 
sounds original and potentially 
invigorating, “The Accountant” 
’s narrative relies too much on 
showing a bunch of complicat-
ed events and then later trying 
to explain and find reasoning 
behind them. Because of this 
failed technique, the story feels 
unclear and unnecessarily con-
fusing at times, and suspenseful 

moments never feel resolved or 
satisfying.

Ben Affleck stars as Chris-

tian Wolff, the gun-wielding 
with autism. Beyond Affleck, 
the movie boasts a stacked 

lineup, 
featur-

ing J.K. Simmons 
(“Whiplash”) 
as an executive 
of the Treasury 
Department, Anna 
Kendrick (“Pitch 
Perfect”) as a fel-
low 
accountant 

and Jeffrey Tam-
bor (“The Hang-
over”) as Wolff’s 
old 
crime 
guru 

and prison inmate. The perfor-
mances are adequate enough 
but lack any true development. 
“The Accountant” is far from a 
character study, but viewers still 
won’t feel deeply for any charac-
ter. Flashbacks involving Wolff’s 
complicated childhood struggles 
with autism act as a cop out for 
any real character development 
in the movie’s timeline and rein-
force the aforementioned “show 
then tell” narrative technique. 
Affleck’s performance, although 
decent, fails to convince the 
viewer that an actual accountant 
could be enough of a badass to 
successfully pull off long-range 
sniping or lethal hand-to-hand 
combat.

The larger-than-life abilities 

of the titular accountant suggest 
great potential to carry the movie 
into groundbreaking territory 
within the action genre. How-
ever, by the end, Wolff isn’t even 
an accountant anymore, wasting 
the most original aspect of the 
movie. In the many action scenes 
of “The Accountant,” you forget 

that you aren’t watching another 
typical action movie starring a 
macho, hyper-masculine pro-
tagonist. What feels fresh in the 
beginning becomes tedious by 
the end, and the idea that Wolff 
ever was a ‘lower-case a’ accoun-
tant is abandoned.

Autism plays a central role in 

the movie, but it doesn’t charac-
terize Affleck’s role in a genuine 
way. Wolff is portrayed as a socio-
pathic killing machine incapable 
of developing personal relation-
ships with others. Although a few 
scenes introduce the idea that he 
could be capable of forming typi-
cal feelings for others, his autism 
is ultimately used as a scapegoat 
to divert any attention away from 
this humanization. Stereotypes 
of autism — lack of empathy, 
obsessive nature, etc. — charac-
terize Wolff as an antihero rather 
than a well-rounded protagonist.

It hasn’t been the best year for 

Affleck. With the critical failure 
of “Batman v Superman” and the 
agonizing “sad Affleck” meme, 
“The Accountant” will not resur-
rect him from the dark depths of 
meme culture. It also won’t lead 
to more scrutiny. The movie is 
just mediocre enough for him 
to avoid publicly drawing the 
shame that he did with “Batman 
v Superman.”

All accountants feeling uncool 

will rejoice after watching “The 
Accountant.” Finally, a movie 
that doesn’t feed into another 
joke about how lame and boring 
their jobs are. They will, how-
ever, be some of the only people 
rejoicing after watching the 
movie. “The Accountant” is far 
from a failed action movie, but 
it is empty entertainment, none-
theless.

“The last time I felt most proud would probably 

be about a month ago, when a patient that I was 

working with in the hospital for over a month, 

stood up and walked for the first time in three 

years. I felt proud and humble that I was able to be 

there to be apart of this amazing milestone for him 

and be able to see the joy that radiated from his 

face. It made me radiate with joy.”

– Nursing junior Alexis Valenciano

B

eing a senior in college just means you’re aca-
demically eligible to not take classes anymore 
and be given a piece of paper that says you’re 

somewhat qualified to work in some capacity in the pro-
fessional world. I made it to that point in three years, oth-
ers may take five or even more. And that’s OK. Because at 
the end of the day every senior, whether you are 20 or 65, 
now has to make that next step.

I had my first official job interview today. Rather, I had 

my first scheduled first official job interview today that 
my interviewer forgot about and had to reschedule. So the 
takeaway from that is that I am capable of remembering 
dates and times.

The job is nothing special; it’s a glorified volunteer posi-

tion canvassing neighborhoods to lobby congressmen to 
pass environmental-friendly laws. But, it’s a job nonethe-
less. A job related in some way to my hopeful career path 
as an environmental lawyer.

A job I feel wholly unqualified for, sans my ability to 

remember appointments.

I am an international studies major, and a double minor 

in oceanography and history of art, essentially the quint-
essential liberal arts student. I can spout off random infor-
mation about the “Golden Age” of Dutch art, or the speed 
of a wave or political uprisings in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Without making this my CV, I have tried to steer the class-
es I take to be oriented to human right and environmental 
policy.

But the reality is I will never feel qualified to be an adult 

in an adult job when I graduate. And that’s fine. From the 
numerous sitcoms and romantic comedies I have exten-
sively researched for the sole purpose of this statement. 
Almost every adult feels that way too. And that helps me to 
have the confidence to apply to these positions and to try 
to convince a recruitment manager that despite my lack 

of experience and qualifications for the job, I am a 

safe investment.

If nothing else, at least I can say I am an expe-

rienced and skilled verbal and written commu-
nicator, #RushTheMichiganDaily. 

 my post-graduation plans, I still have confi-

dence. And that’s important. How can you sell your-
self and your skills to someone without believing 
that you are capable for the job you are applying 

for?

It 
sounds hard, I know. Confidence 
is hard to achieve especially 
when we are bombarded daily 
with reminders of how lacklus-
ter we are as people between 
social media and advertising 
and just comparing ourselves to 
peers. But confidence is plausible 

to achieve. You, we and I are capable 

young adults who are graduating from the 

best public university in the world. That counts 

for something.
As senior year goes on, I’m finding how irrelevant feel-

ing inadequate for a job is. You are adequate, you are able, 
you are as much of a good applicant as the next unqualified 
inexperienced college graduate. With that being said, don’t 
study English as an undergrad and expect to be employed 
as a computer analyst for JP Morgan with a starting salary 
of $80,000.

How to apply to jobs:

1. Apply to as many jobs as you feel comfortable with.
2. Shed a tear for every hour spent on writing cover 

letters.

3. Learn to hate cover letters with a fiery passion.
4. DO NOT REUSE COVER LETTERS, you will 

inevitably fail and use the wrong cover letter for the 
wrong company.

5. You will not get hired if you do this.
6. I know this.
7. Remember, you will eventually get hired.
8. Eat lots of food; getting rejected will make you 

hungry.

9. Talk to others about your acceptances and 

rejections; talking it out will always destress you to 
some extent

10. Blast “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor.
11. Because believe it or not, you will survive and 

make it in the adult world.

hile editing articles for 
The Michigan Daily, I’ll 
often question why a rule 

exists. For example, I might wonder 
why we don’t use the Oxford comma 
or why “percent” is spelled out. While 
these little rules are aggravating at 
times, I’ll always move on and con-
tinue editing the article. If I let my 
frustration toward the silly rule con-
sume me, I would waste time and 
never get my job done. I remember a 
similar reaction in high school when I 
was first learning MLA style. The for-
mat seemed arbitrary, but I knew that 
I needed to learn MLA to succeed in 
my classes. In short, having to follow 
a certain guideline can sometimes 
suck, but it’s easier to learn the rules 
and follow them than is to ruminate 
on them.

A couple of weeks ago, LSA junior 

Marisa Frey wrote her “Copy That” 
column on how we all have our own 
guidelines for how we behave and 
interact with others. Keeping this 
column in mind over the past few 
weeks, I couldn’t help but link it with 
the campus-wide focus on personal 
pronouns. Essentially, the addition of 
personal pronouns to class rosters is a 
new part of the teacher’s style guides. 
I’m not saying this to downplay the 
importance of this addition. I believe 
it took too long for the administration 
to realize the necessity of including 
pronouns on class rosters. The pro-
nouns are another way that profes-
sors can ensure the comfort of all of 
their students. Being misidentified is 

an unnecessary distraction from a stu-
dent’s education.

If hundreds of thousands of high 

school and college students across 
the country can all use different for-
mats for their essays and presenta-
tions, then why is keeping personal 
pronouns in mind while addressing 
students so radical? To some students, 
the idea seems so ridiculous that 
they’ve responded by mocking it with 
#UMPronounChallenge, 
a 
hashtag 

started by LSA junior Grant Strobl, 
national chair of the Young Americans 

for Freedom. Some students mocked 
the new pronoun policy by adding 
“Princess” or “King” to their names. 
Others responded to the hashtag 
with frustrated tweets about why the 
#UMPronounChallenge was harmful.

Aside from the fact that calling this 

a “pronoun challenge” displayed that 
Strobl didn’t understand basic English 
grammar, the creation of the hashtag 
blatantly ignored the call for a more 
inclusive campus.

LSA senior Kyle Stefek responded 

with a comment on Strobl’s Facebook 

post regarding the addition of “His 
Majesty” to his roster. 

“I think the only flaw you’ve found 

in the University’s system is that they 
didn’t account for students who … feel 
the need to mock their trans/non-
binary peers,” Stefek wrote. “The fact 
that you think this is cause for mock-
ery rather than celebration makes it 
clear you don’t really understand your 
privilege here — pronouns aren’t arbi-
trary for everyone.”

In the end, all Strobl’s response 

did — in addition to cultivating the 
prejudices faced by transgender and 
non-binary students every day — was 
create a deeper divide between stu-
dents who supported the addition of 
pronouns to rosters and students who 
thought that it was unnecessary.

If I started a hashtag every time 

the Daily had a guideline that I didn’t 
agree with, I would never get any-
thing done here. To respond with such 
mockery of the new guideline — which 
is meant to make the University of 
Michigan a more comfortable place 
for transgender and non-binary stu-
dents — shows an ignorance and an 
inability to adapt to a society that has a 
constantly changing “Stylebook.”five-
year assignment, I am thankful for my 
immigration to the United States. So, 
thanks, Mom and Dad, for real this 
time, for moving us across the world.

“I don’t know what locker room he’s in. No, I didn’t 
appreciate it, to be completely honest. That’s not 
our locker room talk. I don’t know Trump very 
well at all, but I don’t know who he’s played for 
last couple years to even say he’s been in anybody’s 
locker room and had those kind of conversations.”

—UDONIS HASLEM, former Miami Heat player, on Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump’s 2005 comments about touching women without 
their concent, reported earlier this month. Trump has characterized the 
remarks as “locker room talk”. 

on the record: “Locker Room Talk”

“It is never appropriate to sexually assault or 
harass a woman, ever — there’s no place for that, 
but to act like I have not heard or said something 
inappropriate that I wouldn’t want to get to the 
public, it’s just not true. I played for 16 years... but 
to act like in my 16 years in an NBA locker room, 
I haven’t heard sexually explicit stuff or said 
sexually explicit stuff, that’s just not true,” 

— CHARLES BARKLEY, former NBA player 

“There’s players in our locker room with sisters,

I

t’s not here to give out grades, to set 
learning objectives or to change people. 
It doesn’t teach about alcoholism or 

how to balance a checkbook. It’s not here to save 
souls or proselytize. Rather, the Prison Creative 
Arts Project goes into prisons around Michigan 
with a simpler mission — to bring joy.

Started in 1990 under Buzz Alexander, a pro-

fessor of English at the University of Michigan, 
PCAP incorporates visual, written and theatri-
cal art into the lives of inmates from prisons in 
southeast Michigan, and accepts artistic sub-
missions from all 33 prisons statewide. 

The impetus for it came from a 1990 class-

action lawsuit filed by incarcerated women 
vying for the opportunity to earn college credit 
while incarcerated, as men were already able to 
earn degrees in jail. At the time, Alexander had 
been instructing courses on street theatre when 
his students learned of the lawsuit and con-
vinced him to bring his classes to the women’s 
prison in Ypsilanti, the only one in the state at 
the time.

Thirty six years later, the project is now led 

by Ashley Lucas, a professor of theatre and 
drama at the University.

Originally intending to write a book about 

the program, Lucas joined it in Jan. 2013. She 
spent a year following Alexander’s students to 
see its effects, which, she said, confirmed her 
initial assumptions about the power of the pro-
gram. 

“Doing this program as a student radically 

changes the perspective on what the arts can 
do and the feelings on the justice system,” 
Lucas said. “It’s a much greater learning tool 
about those ideas and our cultural as a carceral 
nation.”

She eventually had to scrap her plans for a 

book, but as she was studying PCAP by attend-
ing workshops, collecting field data and follow-
ing Alexander around, PCAP was studying her.

“They were looking for somebody for about 10 

years,” Lucas said. “Someone interested in con-
tinuing (Alexander’s) work capable of achieving 
tenure at the University of Michigan.”

Lucas said Alexander, who had taught at 

the University for more than 30 years before 
his recent retirement, found an entirely differ-
ent learning environment from the one he had 
grown accustomed to at the University.

“You have the undivided attention of people 

in the room,” Lucas said. “It’s hard to walk into 
a classroom and find that level of attentiveness 
and readiness, to find that eagerness to be part 
of something bigger than yourself.”

Alexander was the program’s trailblazer and, 

according to Lucas, didn’t stop to consider what 
other people had to say about his project.

“I think Buzz did a lot of things on his own 

incrementally,” Lucas said. “The University was 
a different place back then. He was taking him-
self into prisons, I don’t think he asked permis-
sion.”

Students from the program have achieved 

honors both artistically and academically, such 
as Mary Heinen, who was formally incarcer-
ated in Michigan’s only female prison, was able 
to earn a bachelor’s degree from the University 
under Alexander’s tutelage. To achieve this, a 
student proxy went to class for her, took notes 
and sent her the assignments. Heinen has since 
been the recipient of the Soros Justice Fellow-
ship, a fund to support criminal justice reform 
work.

“That climate educationally has changed 

drastically since the early ‘90s,” Lucas said. 
“The University was a much more open place 
in terms of how it approached people in prison 
educationally. In part, they’re no longer being 
taught by professors. You have to apply to the 
University and pay full tuition in order to get a 
degree.”

Alexander’s struggles in getting the program 

off the ground mirror those of current volun-
teers, who undergo extensive training and sur-
veillance before stepping foot in prison.

The PCAP Process

About four years ago, while still on parole, 

Aaron Kinzel started working as a facilitator 
with PCAP. At the time, he was in a graduate 
program at the University. A native of Monroe, 
Mich., Kinzel has never been incarcerated in 
Michigan as an adult, but spent time in a Michi-
gan juvenile detention facility and 10 years in 
Maine jails after being convicted for attempted 
murder in 1997 in Maine.

Kinzel is now also a doctoral candidate 

and a faculty member in the Criminology and 
Criminal Justice departments. He said he felt 
disheartened before applying to the University 
considering his record. Though he had already 
received his associate’s degree at Monroe 
County Community College, and his bachelor’s 
at Siena Heights University, he had been reject-
ed by other colleges in the area.

“Probably one of the biggest things I describe 

my own personal narrative,” Kinzel said. “I 
personalize myself with someone who is incar-
cerated. I know how empowering it is to get 
contact with people from the inside that I’m a 
part of their culture.”

Kinzel is now a leader in the Linkage Project, 

a program through PCAP where former pris-
oners come back into the community to lead 
workshops. Kinzel led one such workshop at the 
Monroe County Youth Center, where he was 
incarcerated as a juvenile. He said the experi-
ence of returning, even as an adult, was stress-
ful for him.

“It was creepy as hell, and very anxiety driv-

en — there’s this anxiousness it’s really hard 
to describe,” Kinzel said. “Different sounds, 
smells, the clicking of a door … it really trig-
gers a physical emotional response. To go back 
where I was as a kid — even though I didn’t 
really spend that much time there — I felt that 
melt away when I was connecting with kids that 
were a mirror image of myself and how I over-

come adversity really helpful.”

The difficulties that come with integrating 

into prison life mean the program has signifi-
cant training requirements, the bulk of which 
concerns what permissible in the prison for 
both volunteers and participants.

Initial requirements for volunteers are mini-

mum — they have to be older than 18 with no 
criminal record to get into the prisons. Though 
there are few non-student volunteers, the 
amount shifts from semester to semester.

Training for the volunteers has several com-

ponents. There is one occurrence of all-day 
training in the first weekend of the semester, 
which Lucas said has regularly supported 60 to 
80 participants, including some people enrolled 
in the classes. After that, facilitators meet every 
other week to meet with mentor about work-
shops and get advice with program staff and 
faculty.

Diversity is a staple among those who volun-

teer for PCAP, from slam poets from Detroit to 
a woman in her 60s was doing a quilting work-
shop last year with a University student. There 
are cases like Susan Ashmore, a community 
volunteer, who got involved because one of the 
long-time PCAP volunteers went to her church 
and gave a talk in 2008. Ashmore is pioneering 

the project’s first workshop in a federal prison 
for the first time alongside Larry Root, a profes-
sor in the School of Social Work.

Lucas said the program devises a list of 

agreements before the workshop can begin, 
usually incorporating some of the rules of the 
prison facility, like no touching. Additionally, 
they aim to avoid activities that would require 
participants to close their eyes or turn their 
backs, which are safety concerns within a pris-
on setting.

For students who participate, the challenges 

varied, with many noting there are barriers to 
entry or perceptions they hadn’t expected. 

Music, Theatre & Dance senior Leia Squil-

lace began working with PCAP her junior year 
and said she initially got involved because she’s 
been interested in using theatre and perfor-
mance for social change.

“I think that theatre has an incredible capac-

ity for people to relate to each other, and to 
bolster empathy,” Squillace said. “So when I 
learned about PCAP, I thought what an incred-
ible opportunity to put those theories to the test 
with practical experience.”

Squillace led her first workshop at Cooper 

Street Correctional Facility in Jackson, Mich., 
with another student facilitator. During that 

semester, she instructed about 10 participants 
once a week in two-hour sessions.

“I was very prepared for leading theatre 

exercises,” Squillance said. “I felt I was pre-
pared to have fun with the participants. What 
I didn’t feel prepared for, or what surprised me, 
I guess, working in a prison like this is one of 
the most closed-off communities and environ-
ments in our entire country.”

Squillace said it was difficult to access that 

community because there are legal stipulations 
meant to keep people out. Personally, she said 
she knew few individuals with access to people 
with those experiences, and said she found 
depictions of prison life as portrayed by the 
media to be mostly inaccurate.

“One of the most, I think, difficult aspects 

about PCAPS is that after the workshop I can’t 
casually enter the prison to see them and it’s 
heartbreaking,” Squillace said. “I became 
so close with them, and I had honestly more 
uncomfortable interactions with the guards 
than with any of the incarcerated people.”

“Honestly, I’m not sure what the perceptions 

are of PCAP,” she continued. “I think maybe 
one is that we are entering the prison to like 
educate our participants, because I think really 
the mission of PCAP is all people, regardless of 
whether they are incarcerated, have a right to 
creative expression. And ultimately, that’s what 
we aim to provide.”

Squillace traveled last May with Lucas and 

about 18 other facilitators to conduct similar 
workshops in prisons, hospitals and isolated 
communities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

“That trip proved to me that what we are 

doing at PCAP, while it seems unique, it’s work 
that a lot of people find important not just in 
Michigan or in the United States but interna-
tionally as well,” she said. 

Anna Clark, a University alum and current 

Knight Wallace Fellow, got started with the 
program as an undergrad. Several years ago, 
alongside Matt Erikson, another University and 
PCAP alum, she started a theater program in 

Detroit. This January will be the five-year anni-
versary of their program.

“I was doing a workshop at a prison in Jack-

son that’s now closed,” Clark said. “It was a 
writers group. It involved a lot of props, objects. 
I also happened to bring a copy of The Michigan 
Daily because it had an article about the annual 
prison art show.”

Clark, who has written about her experienc-

es with the program for The New York Times, 
said some challenges she faced as a facilitator 
involved the vagaries of the prison system. She 
said it was difficult when a long-time partici-
pant is relocated and there isn’t an opportunity 
for closure. She also noted a time when she was 
banned from one of her workshops: tradition-
ally items brought into the prisons were cata-
logued with the guards, and on that day, the 
program was running late and the group was 
waved in. Among the props Clark had gathered 
for the improv workshop was a bracelet. On 
their way out, Clark was showing the contents 
of her bag when she realized someone had writ-
ten on the newspaper.

“They saw the note, and a bracelet that could 

have been a gift, so they kicked me out,” Clark 
said. “Sometimes that kind of stuff happens. I 
get it. When you bring in young people that are 
new at this and whether intentionally or not 
there can be risks that you don’t even realize, 
and I get that. I think the people who work in 
these places have an exceptionally tough job. 
They would rather be over cautious than under 
cautious. Some facilities, they don’t have to let 
us come in — and some don’t.”

“Anything that you take into a prison you 

have to get approved for,” Lucas said. “You can 
get the whole program thrown out of the prison 
for not taking all five pens out.”

Another, perhaps less obvious, stigma are 

concerns of romantic relationships occurring 
between the volunteers and the prisoners.

“It’s perfectly natural to develop feelings,” 

Lucas said. “Prisoners may want to pass a love 
note, but you can’t bring anything out of the 

prison that you haven’t secured permission for 
ahead of time. If someone slips a love note into a 
notebook, so even if my students didn’t know it 
was there, our program suffers.”

Lucas cited in particular an incident that 

occurred on a sponsored safe sex day on cam-
pus, during which condoms were being distrib-
uted on the Diag, and one female participant 
unthinkingly slipped one into her pocket on her 
way to participate in PCAP.

“You can understand why that looks sus-

picious even though she didn’t have sexual 
designs on anyone,” Lucas said. “We support 
our students. We are here for them, but we have 
to abide by the rules of the facility. But what can 
happen to the people in our workshops, if rules 
are broken, even if we’re the ones breaking 
them, is the people who signed up to participate 
in our workshops are the one who really suffer.”

For students, being able to fully commit to 

the program is also a challenge. 

“I think, well, one of the challenges is it’s 

just time,” Clark said. “I think a lot of the folks 
you work with have been on the wrong side of a 
broken system, just being there despite all odds 
over time.” 

A PCAP associate, Clark still does a work-

shop but isn’t a regular participant. She said one 
misconception she consistently addresses is the 
nature of the interactions themselves.

“They teach us how to be better,” she said. 

“They make up an exercise. I think that back-
and-forth energy is better for everybody. It’s not 
a charitable project that implies a one-direc-
tional relationship.”

However, she said the program opened her 

eyes by granting her the freedom to see first-
hand the realities of a prison setting.

“There really aren’t a lot of programs like 

this, and the fact that this has lasted as long 
as it has, after a change in leadership with 
the University, change in leadership from the 
department of corrections, and the change of 
leadership through the program,” Clark said. 
“That’s amazing, that’s a testament to the infra-
structure to the program and the people that 
have shown up to it.”

The Program Today

A annual art show is the program’s climax 

and biggest expense. All of the art is matted, a 
technique that involves spraying a protective 
sealant over the piece, so the pieces are ready to 
be displayed. Walls must be constructed within 
the showroom at the Duderstadt Center each 
year, though it’s still not enough space.

“We make a video to send to all the prisons 

because they can’t come to see their art,” Lucas 
said. “Show every piece of art in the show. And 
we send that video and produce the video nicely 
and asked that it be played on the closed circuit 
TV.”

The type of artwork, and the training par-

ticipants receive in the leadup to the art shows, 
varies. 

In general, Lucas said, to be involved in the 

program an inmate must be “ticket-free,” or 
have gone without incident, for six months. 
Workshops are conducted in both private and 
public juvenile facilities as well as the adult 
prisons.The program provides services for 
level-one prisoners, who are nearing the end of 
their sentences, but can only accept submission 

from those at level five, which is solitary con-
finement.

“The things about levels is that they are 

separated from each other for various security 
reasons,” Lucas said. “We are only allowed to 
program with people of a select level together. 
We never ask about people’s crimes.”

Lucas said over the course of the project, the 

types of submissions have varied, some in direct 
correlation to what’s happening in the world 
outside.

“Things like technology are often confusing 

to people in prison,” Lucas said. “There’s some 
things that are difficult to picture, but there are 
other things to which people respond to con-
temporary critique.”

Notable shifts in submissions, he said, 

occurred after Hurricane Katrina and after the 
news broke about the Flint water crisis. The 
year President Barack Obama was elected, he 
was featured in many pieces displayed by the 
program.

“There are often very thoughtful pieces that 

address environmental concerns,” Lucas said. 
“You can spend decades of your life without 
touching a blade of grass. (Inmates) are not 
allowed to be barefoot, so to think about wild-
life and nature. There’s a lot of contemporary 
political thought.”

Lucas said, based off her studies of similar 

programs, she believes PCAP to be the largest 
prison arts programming in terms of the num-
ber of people, the number of prisoners that have 
access to our programming and the number of 
people they serve.

“It’s above and beyond anything we’ve seen 

anywhere else and it’s the infrastructure of 
the University that makes that possible,” Lucas 
said.

Because the material reality in prison is so 

constrained, the project has acquired a reputa-
tion as a refuge for the incarcerated. Lucas said 
while bringing art is a gift to anyone’s life, the 
benefits brought to the prisoners isn’t the only 
impact. 

“I think the patent assumption that people 

tend to make when they hear about this pro-
gram is that it’s changing people in prison most 
of all,” she said. “I would argue strongly about 
that. There’s a lot of very casual remarks that 
say that we liberate people in prisons with the 
arts, that people feel free.”

Beyond the art itself, the program enables 

prisoners to engage not just with those out-
side their scope, but also each other, building 
a community that enables all involved to have 
connective positive activity that they cannot 
engender by themselves. Prisoners cannot usu-
ally congregate together, as it increases the risk 
of gang activity or violence, and activity must be 
supervised.

Lucas said though the prisons often cast 

them in the role of supervisors, the primary 
objective of PCAP is to bring joy.

“I think we do change people, to connect 

meaning with others, give some agency, we try 
to let the prison drive the programming, but 
once we’re in there we say to the folks in prison 
or in the facilities, what should the end product 
of this look like let us help you make what you 
want,” Lucas said.

Allows Students and Inmates to Flourish

My 

sister is the 
strongest 
person 
I 

know. 
On 

March 12, 2014, 
she 
was 
the 

victim of a head-on 
collision that should 
have sent her Pontiac’s 
engine into the cabin 
of her car and cut her in 
half. Instead, miraculously, 
it didn’t, and Kasandra is still 
here to laugh a little too loud 
and keep me in line. To say I 
love her is an understatement.

While 
Kasandra’s 

unbelievable 
survival 
is 

something my family celebrates 
every day, she suffered extensive 
injuries. Since the accident she’s 
had three invasive hip surgeries. 
The first two operations fixed her torn 
labrums — one in each hip socket — and the 
third, recent procedure was to re-open her right hip to 
remove a massive calcium deposit.

Each of these surgeries has left her homebound for 

weeks, unable to bathe and clothe herself without our 
mother’s help, and in an extreme amount of pain. Though 
I’m confident Kasandra will make a complete recovery to 
full mobility, there will still be setbacks. By the end of the 
ordeal, she’ll have been robbed of more than two years 
in her 20s due to surgeries and painful recovery because 
of the other driver’s carelessness. Even at the end of 
Kasandra’s recovery, she’ll never again be able to run and 
jump like she otherwise would have been able to.

Kasandra has an undying determination to continue 

to live beyond her current limitations and put both 
feet forward as best she can. She still dresses up and 
goes out, albeit with her hip brace attached over all her 
dresses. Kasandra needs help putting her right shoe on 
and someone to condition her hair in the kitchen sink. 
She always needs to find a table that can accommodate 
her wheelchair, an elevator to get to the train platform, a 
sidewalk even enough to get down the street. And though 
it would be so much easier to stay home and sulk, my sister 
doesn’t.

I have always drawn strength from my sister. I’m a 

believer 
in 
fate: 
I 

think destiny exists and there 
is 

a reason Kasandra is the older sibling. She has been the 
only person to unquestionably stay by my side through 
everything since I was born. Kasandra is both my role 
model and my best friend, and shows me every day — 
especially now — that strength is not inherent. No one is 
born strong. Instead, people are given the opportunity to 
be strong.

I can’t begin to imagine how much easier it would be 

to never leave the house. Getting ready for anything 
takes so much more effort for Kasandra than it used to, 
and honestly, if I were in her place, I don’t know that I 
would have the will to keep on going the way she has. 
Between the painful at-home hip exercises and powerful 
pain medications at the beginning of each recovery, I don’t 
know where she gets the stamina to do it all.

Even more amazing to me is her mental recovery during 

this period. After such a traumatic experience, I can’t 
fathom what it must have been like to get back in a car and 
drive through the spot where the other driver crossed into 
her lane.

Her persistence is a large part of the reason why I finally 

decided to come out this past summer. Though I don’t 
know how I would act if I were in my sister’s place, seeing 
her have the continued determination to live beyond the 

hand she was dealt gave 
me the courage to finally be 

honest with both myself and 

everyone I know. I realized that 

if Kasandra could wake up each 

day and face the world and all its 
challenges for her circumstances, so 
could I.

Kasandra has always shown me 

what it means to be a strong person. 
It isn’t easy, but I now know that it’s 

worth it. Every challenge she has faced, 

even before her accident, has made my sister 

the incredibly tenacious person she is today. 
It’s because she has met each obstacle with the 
courage to do right and the will to keep going 
that I know she will recover in both body and 
spirit. She is, in short, unstoppable.

That doesn’t mean, however, there haven’t been 

moments of struggle. I’ve seen her frustration with 
the accident, the three surgeries, the dependence 

she’s had on others and the enormity of everyday 

tasks for her. It’s so incredibly difficult to watch 

those you love suffer through pain for the hope of an 

easier future, but Kasandra has this fire in her that never 
ceases to burn. My sister is a force, a fierce woman and an 
individual. Needless to say, she isn’t usually one to ask for 
help unless she really needs it.

Watching my sister go through this ordeal has made 

me realize that strength does not always equate to 
independence. In fact, it often means the opposite. Being 
strong doesn’t mean standing alone and above everyone. 
It’s recognizing that you need help and asking for it. It’s 
being patient when it would be so easy to fall apart. It’s 
having the determination to keep living.

Through my whole life Kasandra has shown me 

how important it is to be independent, persistent and 
unapologetically individual. Not a single day goes by 
where I think of how horribly altered my life would have 
been if the car engine had entered the cabin and ended her 
life. In a lot of ways, it would have ended mine too. I would 
have lost my best friend, my only sibling, my greatest hero.

I’m so incredibly fortunate to still find her support 

and undying love. My sister gives me hope that there are 
people in this world filled with compassion and courage, 
determination and strong will, strength. And every day, 
she reminds me that I can be one of them.

Life is a Mixtape: Living in Color

F

irst, a confession: I’m jealous of 
people with synesthesia, and I 

always have been.

Colours - Grouplove

Ah yes, jealousy of an inborn neuro-

logical phenomenon. All the great love 
stories in the world have spawned from 
it, right?

Definitely not. Not at all. It’s just me.
For those who don’t know, synesthe-

sia is, by super fancy definition in the 
dictionary, “a sensation produced in one 
modality when a stimulus is applied to 
another modality, as when the hearing 
of a certain sound induces the visualiza-
tion of a certain color.” In college-kid 
English: People with synesthesia see a 
letter of the alphabet, or a number, and 
they inherently associate it with a color. 
A is pink, B is green, one is orange and 
two is yellow. Sometimes synesthesia 
extends to the other senses — illogical 
associations involving taste, smell and 
so on — but “grapheme-color synesthe-
sia” (letters, numbers and color) is one 
of the more common forms. I’m char-
treuse with envy. Is it obvious?

Cry to Me - Solomon Burke

A litany of famous artists and musi-

cians have had it. It permeates the 
writing of one of my favorite authors, 
Vladimir Nabokov. His doomed narra-
tor in “Lolita” describes a dilemma in 
a beloved phrase of mine: “And I was 
laughing happily, and the atrocious, 
unbelievable, unbearable, and, I suspect, 
eternal horror that I know now was still 
but a dot of blackness in the blue of my 
bliss … ”

It’s this seizure of broad, airborne 

emotions — horror, happiness, disgust 
— and attaching them to hues, so as to 
enhance our understanding of, well, us, 
that intrigues me most about synesthe-
sia. Our bliss is blue — our horror, a dot 
of blackness on a quilt of cerulean. This 
is how I want to see the world.

Feels Like We Only Go Backwards - 

Tame Impala

Mostly, I’m jealous of synesthetes 

that see and feel colors when they lis-
ten to music. This type of synesthesia is 
called “chromesthesia,” and it comes in 
an array of subforms. What’s notable is 

a lack of consensus surrounding it; there 
is no set “key” to the musical note-color 
pairs. B-flat can be yellow to one person, 
and red to the next— it’s all up to the solo 
synesthete’s mind to make the magical 
link.

At the beginning of fall break, my dad 

came to pick me up. Our drives home are 
a constant source of inspiration for me: 
Dad is a musician with an encyclope-
dic knowledge of music, and there’s no 
one I’d rather fight with for radio con-
trol. I yell at him about Steely Dan, he 
yells at me about Britney Spears, c’est la 
vie. But then we come around and hit a 
sweet spot, like this past Friday on Siri-
us XMU: Tame Impala’s “Feels Like We 
Only Go Backwards.”

I hadn’t heard it in a proper year (one 

of those songs with which I abused the 
replay button and, alas, grew indifferent 
toward), and this time it sounded fuzzy 
and familiar. I looked to my left and 
noticed my dad bathed in titian light, a 
secondhand glow brought about by the 
golden trees to the side of the freeway. 
It was dusk, and they were whirring 

past us at 80 mph, and they made him 
tangerine, the steering wheel mustard, 
the dashboard a mango blur of setting 
sunlight. “Feels Like We Only Go Back-
wards” sounds orange to me now.

“Silver Street (Live)” - Ben Folds 

Five

Last week I was stressed in the Uni-

versity of Michigan Museum of Art, 
trapped in that ivory edifice of aca-
demic sweat, listening to one of the 
only live albums I will actually listen to 
(Ben Folds Live). “Silver Street” came 
on, with its perfect jazz chord progres-
sions and sad-bar-pianist attitude, and it 
calmed me instantly. I thought about the 
silver all around. The metallic sleekness 
of UMMA — the chrome sheen and the 
whites, the stillness of the ivory walls 
and the deep blue of the night sky peek-
ing through their windows. It felt the 
way silver feels. Beautiful, but sharp.

And then I was in that pink-wine-

haze with “Little Bird” by Annie Lennox 
playing, sitting with my housemates at 
the kitchen table and seeing mauve on 

their phone screens, rose-colored pil-
lows on the couch, the smell of 3 a.m. 
“Disco Inferno” feels like red to me now, 
the deep crimson of Solo cups at work 
and the scarlet smiles of my friends and 
coworkers to my left, to my right.

Color is everywhere, but, then again, it 

always has been. And we, as people with 
brains, can make it show itself however 
we want it to, connect it to certain expe-
riences that we want to savor, certain 
songs. Even if these associations aren’t 
innate, like they are with synesthesia 
and those who have it, we can choose to 
notice opportunities for connections to 
occur — and we can let them occur.

The Village - New Order

Then sometimes, for no reason (and 

it’s best if we don’t have one), we can 
hear a rainbow.

Big Ten
» Page 3B

BIG RAPIDS — It was the 

perfect storm: a hungry team 
searching for its first win in 
front of a rambunctious home 
crowd, a young team making its 
first road trip of the season and a 
freshman goaltender making his 
first start.

But the No. 13 Michigan 

hockey team weathered the 
storm, emerging with a 2-1 win 
over Ferris State Friday night at 
Ewigleben Arena.

The Wolverines (2-1) were 

tested early and often by the 
Bulldogs (0-5), who set the tone 
with an aggressive forecheck 

and physical play. Ferris State 
kept 
the 
Michigan 
attack 

mostly in check and outshot the 
Wolverines in all three periods, 
finishing with a 29-16 advantage 
for the game.

But a young Michigan team 

hung tight behind strong play 
from freshman netminder Jack 
LaFontaine, who dealt with odd-
man rushes all night en route to 
making 28 saves.

“I thought Jack played great 

the whole game,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “They 
put pressure on us in the first 
period, more pressure in the 
second period — especially when 
we were two men short — and 
then in the third period when 
the game was on the line. For a 

freshman goalie to come in here 
and win a game like that is really 
impressive.”

Added LaFontaine: “As the 

game progressed, I kinda found 
my groove. I think our entire 
team found their groove. We got 
better as the game went on, and I 
think as much as the fans played 
a factor, we blocked it out and 
played our game.”

Michigan made the most of the 

few scoring chances it created 
— the Wolverines could not 
generate a consistent even-man 
attack, but were able to convert 
when given a man advantage.

After coming away empty-

handed on its first two power 
plays 
in 
the 
first 
period, 

Michigan did not let the third go 

to waste. Nearly seven minutes 
into the second period, junior 
forward Dexter Dancs threaded 
a pass between two Bulldogs 
to find freshman center Jake 
Slaker, who put it past the Ferris 
State goaltender for the first goal 
of his career.

“It wasn’t a set play or 

anything,” Slaker said. “I think 
everyone was just kinda puck-
watching. (Alex Kile) ended 
up passing to Dancs, and then 
Dancs saw that I was behind 
everyone and I had a little 
mini-breakaway. So I thought 
it turned out to be a read-and-
react, and we ended up doing 
well with that.”

The Bulldogs came roaring 

back in the third, opening up 

the period with several grade-A 
chances. 
LaFontaine 
made 

several impressive stops to hold 
Michigan’s lead, but was unable 
to prevent Ferris State forward 
Andrew Mayer from burying 
one in the back of the net during 
a Bulldogs power play with 11:23 
left in the third period.

Ferris 
State 
regained 
all 

the momentum with a tying 
goal, and it looked to have 
Michigan on the ropes. But 
the Wolverines regrouped and 
responded with just 4:28 left 
when junior defenseman Sam 
Piazza rifled a shot into the net 
off a pass from Kile.

The 
goal 
came 
during 

Michigan’s sixth power play of 
the game and proved to be the 

game-winner 
as 
LaFontaine 

made several crucial saves over 
the final few minutes to preserve 
the victory.

It may not have been pretty, 

but the result was nonetheless 
impressive for a young team 
that was repeatedly tested in a 
hostile environment.

“I can’t tell you this was a 

good road game in terms of our 
execution,” Berenson said. “As a 
coach, you look at too many shots 
against, too many outnumbered 
rushes, too many penalties and 
so on. We’ve got to get better 
every week, and tonight was a 
tough game to play, but our team 
stayed with it. We never got 
behind, and we found a way to 
win the game.”

Road win highlights areas for improvement

Every 
time 
the 
Michigan 

hockey team killed off a penalty 
during 
Saturday’s 
game 
at 

Ferris 
State, 
the 
announcer 

would say something along the 
lines of, “And the Wolverines 
return to full strength,” which 
was immediately followed by, 
“And they still suck!” from the 
Bulldogs’ student section.

At some point during the 

second period, though, they 
stopped chanting that.

This happened at some point 

after freshman forward Jake 
Slaker scored the first goal of 
the game — and the first of 
his career — off an assist from 
junior forward Dexter Dancs on 
a power play. The Ferris State 
students’ cheers against the 
Wolverines (2-1) quickly turned 
to shouts of frustration toward 
their own players, but only until 
Bulldog forward Andrew Mayer 
managed to score a power-play 
goal during the third period to tie 

up the game, 1-1.

But with four minutes left in 

the third, junior defenseman Sam 
Piazza scored the final goal for 
Michigan to top Ferris State, 2-1, 
which provided an end result to 
the night — the Wolverines found 
a way to win despite not playing 
their best game.

“We knew Ferris would be 

good,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “Ferris is desperate 
— they’re a better team than 
their record, obviously. And this 
is a big game for them. They 
had the crowd, they had every 
opportunity and the referees 
certainly 
gave 
them enough 

power plays — but good for us.

“So the takeaway is, even 

though we might have been 
outshot or outplayed or out-
chanced at times, we found a way 
to win the game.”

Outshot and outplayed might 

be accurate. Even though the 
Wolverines tallied another win, 
the game highlighted areas where 
they could use improvement.

The Wolverines totaled eight 

penalties for the night, including 
one for having too many players 
on the ice. Even though the team 
successfully killed off seven of 
those penalties, one resulted in 
Ferris State’s lone goal to tie up 
the match with seven minutes 
left in the third period. And if it 
hadn’t been for Piazza’s goal late 
in the third, the game could have 
gone either way.

Penalties weren’t the only 

factor 
putting 
pressure 
on 

Michigan, either — the Bulldogs’ 
offense tallied 29 shots for the 
night. Freshman goaltender Jack 
LaFontaine proved to be solid 
in his debut along with the rest 
of the defense, and 28 of those 
29 shots never made it into the 
net. However, the Wolverines’ 
offense couldn’t seem to catch 
up, as they were only able to put 
up 16 shots. And even though two 
of these shots turned into goals, 
Ferris State (0-5) almost doubled 
Michigan’s shot total.

“We didn’t play great — we got 

doubled up on shots basically,” 
Piazza said. “And we gave up a lot 

of odd-man breaks, and that’s kind 
of due to how they play, like they 
play a little differently than we 
might see on a regular basis. We 
can definitely tighten some things 
up, and I’m sure in video we’ll take 
a look at that stuff this week.”

The Wolverines are young 

and the season still early, and 
this game highlighted some of 
the improvements Michigan has 
to make. Even though it killed 
off the majority of the penalties, 
eight miscues in total provide 
cause for concern, especially 
against a team as aggressive as 
the Bulldogs. Trailing 13 shots 
doesn’t make it any easier, either.

The question isn’t whether 

or not they can make these 
improvements, though. Michigan 
proved that last week in its 4-0 
shutout 
against 
Union 
after 

losing the day before, 4-3. But it 
needs to learn how to make these 
improvements stick, and a tough 
road match like the one against 
Ferris might have been exactly 
what the Wolverines needed to 
see that.

B

IG RAPIDS — Jack 
LaFontaine heard the 
hecklers, the kind you 

only hear 
at a college 
hockey road 
game.

The fans 

beat their 
thunderstix 
in chaotic 
harmony, 
a reminder 
that in no 
other sport 
are the fans 
so coordinated in their 
rambunctiousness. Their scorn 
for opposing goaltenders is 
especially resolute.

That’s how LaFontaine got his 

introduction to life as an NCAA 
goalie Saturday at Ferris State. 
And all he did to respond was 
turn in a 28-save performance in 
the Michigan hockey team’s first 
road game of the season.

“I was really nervous,” 

LaFontaine admitted. “… As soon 
as I made my first save, I was 
like, ‘Cool. I can breathe, I can 
play my game, no pressure.’ ”

For the Wolverines to 

succeed this season, a year after 
losing their starting goaltender 
to graduation as well as two-
thirds of their scoring output, 
they are going to need a lot 
more performances like the 
one LaFontaine turned in this 
weekend.

Michigan did not play its best 

hockey against the Bulldogs, 
and without a big game from 
LaFontaine, it likely would have 
lost. The Wolverines struggled 
to generate scoring chances, 
and they seemed to have no one 
to count on in big moments. 
When Kyle Connor, JT Compher 
and Tyler Motte left for the 
NHL, Michigan lost the human 
embodiment of a panic button. 
When those three needed to, 
they delivered.

The Wolverines now have 

young, unproven players in their 
places. Those freshmen may 
not be as prepared as those in 
their positions before, and they 
go into some games nervous as 
LaFontaine did. But if they can 
adjust as well as some have so 
far, perhaps Michigan can string 
together enough breakout games 
to neutralize the loss of bona 
fide stars.

Saturday, LaFontaine 

demonstrated perfectly what 
that might look like.

Late in the game, after junior 

defenseman Sam Piazza had put 
the Wolverines 
up 2-1, 
LaFontaine 
made perhaps 
his best play 
of the night. 
With traffic 
surrounding 
the front of 
the net, he 
somehow 
came up with a 
puck that had 
emerged from the frantic mass 
of bodies.

The puck found its way to 

goal, but when 
play stopped, 
somehow, it 
hadn’t gone 
in. Even 
LaFontaine had 
to admit there 
was a little luck 
involved.

“That was 

a flukey play,” 
he said. “I kind 
of stuck my leg 

up, and it just so happened to hit 
my leg.”

The strange reality 

after Saturday’s win is that 
LaFontaine is by no means a lock 
to start again anytime soon.

Michigan’s other goaltenders 

are senior Zach Nagelvoort 
and freshman Hayden Lavigne, 
who had a shutout in his debut 
last week against Union. And 
while Nagelvoort is the only 
one of the three netminders to 
allow more than one goal in a 
start this season, his experience 
in the crease could ultimately 
make him the starter. It was 
Nagelvoort who started the 

season opener, and Lavigne got 
the start the next day.

That means that for all the 

poise LaFontaine showed in 
Big Rapids, the Wolverines may 
not even have him in net the 
next time they take the ice. And 
since he was a critical reason 
they escaped an upset from 
the young, hungry Bulldogs, 
Michigan may find itself looking 
elsewhere for a boost.

Fortunately for the 

Wolverines, the options are 
there. A defensive line featuring 
senior Nolan De Jong and Piazza 
can provide support, and leading 
returning scorer Alex Kile 
seems ready for a standout year 
as the go-to option.

Then there are the other 

freshmen who, like LaFontaine, 
will be looking for their big 
moments in the coming weeks. 
The hard thing about counting on 
those moments is that you can’t 
predict them. Goal scorers have 
slumps, netminders go cold and 
none of that is easy to break out of.

It will be especially hard for 

Michigan when the opponents 
are more seasoned. Connor, 
Compher and Motte are no 
longer there to bail out the 
Wolverines in times of panic, 
and some teams on the schedule 
will come ready to punch them 
in the mouth.

At one point Saturday, when 

a scrap had broken out near 
Michigan’s net, LaFontaine 
appeared to take a hit in the 
face. Asked about it after the 
game, he said, “It’s just hockey.”

The rest of the Wolverines 

would be wise to adopt that 
mantra. Because the punches 
are coming. And LaFontaine 
might not always be there to 
absorb them.

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Freshman goaltender Jack LaFontaine, making the first start of his career Saturday against Ferris State, lifted Michigan to a win with a 28-save performance.

“As soon as I made 

my first save, I 

was like, cool. I 

can breathe.”

‘M’ drops 4-0 blowout

There were nine minutes left 

on the clock, and the Michigan 
men’s soccer team found itself 
down 
1-0 

to William 
& Mary — a 
deficit that 
was far from insurmountable.

But by the 86th minute, the 

scoreboard read 4-0.

This five-minute blitzkrieg 

was the result of the Tribe 
constantly chipping away at 
the Wolverines’ defense until 
it finally crumbled. In fact, 
Michigan (1-4-1 Big Ten, 2-8-4 
overall) was lucky to have not 
been down by more by the time 
the final whistle blew.

The Wolverines were without 

three of their most important 
players for the game. Sophomore 
defender Marcelo Borges and 
junior midfielder Brett Nason 
sat out with injuries, while 
sophomore midfielder Ivo Cerda 
only played a small role as he 
continues his recovery.

“We were disjointed from 

that,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Chaka Daley. “It’s always hard 
against a team’s first 11 when 
you’re playing with injuries.”

With a makeshift midfield and 

many players out of position, the 
Wolverines were up against the 
wall from the onset.

Usually the team outshooting 

its 
opponents, 
Michigan 

managed to test William & Mary 
keeper Phil Breno only once.

The Tribe (1-3-2 Colonial 

Athletic 
Association, 
7-5-2 

overall) 
managed 
22 
shots 

of its own, 13 of which were 
on target. Were it not for an 
incredible performance from 
redshirt 
junior 
goalkeeper 

Braden Horton — who ended 
the game with nine saves — the 
Wolverines would have suffered 
a much bigger loss.

“Braden (Horton) did very 

well,” Daley said. “It’s weird 
to say that (about the keeper) 
when you lose 4-0, but none 
of the goals were his fault. He 
kept us in the game and kept it 
competitive until the last nine 

minutes.”

William & Mary played a high-

pressing 4-4-2 formation, one that 
proved too much for Michigan’s 
deep-defending 4-3-3.

Antonio Bustamante, Ryder 

Bell and Reilly Maw — the 
Tribe’s forwards — ran riot. 
Bell scored a brace, opening 
and closing the scoring while 
providing an assist to boot. Maw 
scored one and set up two, while 
Bustamante notched both a goal 
and an assist as well.

“They were efficient,” Daley 

said. “And they gave our makeshift 
backline a lot of problems.”

William & Mary looked like 

the better team, but had little to 
show for it until the 40th minute, 
when it moved the ball down the 
right and pushed the Wolverines 
well into their half of the field.

After a good combination 

in and around Michigan’s box, 
Maw found Bell with space on 
the left side of the penalty area. 
Bell curled the ball low into the 
side netting at the far post.

When the ball got rolling for the 

second half, the Tribe looked like 
a changed outfit. They pressed 
higher, moved the ball faster and 
starved Michigan of the ball.

William & Mary’s domination 

was apparent, but for all its good 
work, the ball just wouldn’t hit 
the back of the net. The Tribe hit 
the post twice and Horton came 
out on top time and again in one-
on-one situations. He saved two 
shots from point-blank range 
and was sent diving in every 
direction trying to keep his side 
in the game.

But it was only a matter of 

time until the resistance caved 
in. Bell played a beautifully 
weighted through ball past 
the Michigan backline. Maw 
latched onto the ball, and with 
Bustamante in support, a two-
on-one proved too much for 
Horton. Maw squared the ball 
to Bustamante in the center 
of the box for a simple tap in, 
and the Tribe added two more 
from there.

And 
in 
a 
season 
where 

everything has gone wrong for 
the Wolverines, it was a new low 
in Williamsburg.

Michigan earns scoreless draw

Sarah Jackson already had 

tied her career high in saves 
against Minnesota. But with 
the Golden Gophers threatening 
in the last minute of double 
overtime, 
Michigan 
needed her 
to make one more.

As the crowd began counting 

down the seconds until the 
final whistle blew, the redshirt 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
rose 

over a Gopher player, cleanly 
catching a header for her 11th 
save of the day.

Jackson’s career performance 

preserved a scoreless tie for the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
(5-2-2 Big Ten, 9-3-3 overall), as 
well as her sixth shutout of the 
season.

“I didn’t even know (about the 

career high),” Jackson said. “I’ve 
just been enjoying what I’ve 
been doing this whole season.”

It 
wasn’t 
just 
Jackson, 

though. Senior defender Anna 
Soccorsi returned from injury 
to anchor the defense, making 
key 
clearances 
and 
timely 

interceptions all game. Senior 
defender 
Madisson 
Lewis 

and sophomore forward Abby 
Kastroll 
put 
in 
tough 
and 

energetic performances as well.

While the defense would 

solidify as the game went on, 
No. 15 Minnesota (6-1-2, 12-3-
2) could have easily broken the 
game open in the beginning. 
Utilizing a fluid sequence of 
short passes around the edge 
of the box, the Golden Gophers 
recorded five shots in the first 
15 minutes, forcing Jackson to 
make three saves.

“They’re a fast-starting team, 

they’re a high-pressure team 
— that’s what they do,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“But part of it is they can only 

maintain it for so long.”

After weathering the early 

storm from the Golden Gophers, 
the 
Wolverines 
began 
to 

look for opportunities on the 
counterattack, trying to get 
behind the defense with long 
balls aimed at senior forward 
Nicky 
Waldeck. 
Sophomore 

forward Reilly Martin also made 
an impact, providing several 
dangerous crosses into the box 
and sharp delivery on corner 
kicks. 

“Abby and Reilly pinched into 

the midfield a little bit more, so we 
were able to keep the ball instead 
of being way out wide,” Ryan said. 
“As soon as we started keeping 
the ball, we started creating some 
good chances and having more 
opportunities to attack.”

Despite 
an 
opening 
45 

minutes that could have seen 
either team break the deadlock, 

the match began to take a 
more smashmouth tone after 
intermission. 
Chances 
for 

both teams were met on either 
end with quality, hard-nosed 
defending.

“Just coming into it, we knew 

it was going to be a gritty match 
for both teams, and that we 
would both have to fight hard to 
find goals,” Soccorsi said.

While 
the 
intensity 
level 

held up, neither team seriously 
threatened 
until 
the 
85th 

minute. Waldeck finally was 
able to control a long ball off of 
a swift breakaway, but her chip 
shot flew over the bar.

The two overtime periods saw 

more of the same defensive play, 
with both teams seemingly just 
trying to claw their way to the 
finish, resulting in the scoreless 
final. While the tie extended the 
Wolverines’ winless stretch to 

four games, a draw against the 
15th-ranked team in the nation 
was still an encouraging result.

After surviving the Golden 

Gophers’ 
final 
flurry, 
the 

Wolverines will now shift their 
focus to their next game against 
Ohio State on Saturday, their 
final home game of the season. 

“We definitely want to win at 

home for the seniors, so we’re 
just going to keep the focus of 
team defending and go from 
there,” Jackson said.

While Michigan knows that it 

has to take every game at a time, 
it has bigger goals in mind. The 
Wolverines have barely missed 
qualifying 
from 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament in each of the last 
two years and are looking to 
avoid a similar result this time 
around. In this regard, Sunday’s 
performance likely keeps them 
on track do so.

Jackson, Soccorsi 
team up on defense

Facing No. 15 Minnesota 

and the Big Ten’s leader in 
points and goals per game, 
Simone Kolander, the Michigan 
women’s soccer team needed a 
strong performance out of its 
defense and starting goaltender 
Sarah Jackson.

Fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
that’s 
exactly 

what they received, drawing 
the 
Golden 
Gophers 
in 
a 

scoreless tie. Up against the 
aggressiveness of the opposition 
and a slippery ball on a rain-
soaked pitch, Jackson tied her 
career high in saves with 11.

“Sarah 
continues 
to 
just 

be rock-solid in goal,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“She did everything right today; 
she dealt with some hard shots, 
crosses — she took care of 
everything. She’s had a great, 
great year.”

The 
sophomore 
goalie 

recorded her sixth clean sheet 
of the season, as her half-maize, 
half-mud-colored 
uniform 

spoke to her effort in diving 
saves on shots blasted to both 
corners of net by the Minnesota 
offense.

“At the beginning of the 

game when the field was so 
wet, we thought it was going to 
be a multiple-goal game, so it 
was actually surprising when it 
finished 0-0,” Jackson said. “As 
always, team-defending was our 
number one goal, and we’re just 
happy that we got the shutout.”

Michigan’s 
shutout 
was 

aided by the return of senior 
Anna Soccorsi, whose absence 
due 
to 
a 
concussion 
was 

notable in Thursday’s draw 
against Wisconsin, when the 
Wolverines were forced to play 
with an extra defender. Her 
presence Sunday enabled the 

Wolverines to play in more of an 
attacking 4-3-3 shape.

In the defender’s return to 

the lineup, Soccorsi was vital 
in 
containing 
Minnesota’s 

star attackers, blocking shots, 
intercepting 
passes 
and 

controlling 
the 
Wolverine 

defense across the pitch. 

“It was a good effort by 

everyone to stay inside of their 
player and work hard to get back 
in and mark the box,” Soccorsi 
said. “They were coming at us 
in the beginning, but I think we 
did well to keep them at bay.”

Added Ryan: “I can’t even 

imagine 
playing 
against 

Minnesota without her. Anna 
was everywhere — defending 
and shutting down one-on-one 
situations, giving cover to her 
teammates when they got beat. 
She’s just a fantastic defender, 
and we’re fortunate to have her 
in the middle of our defense.”

Though 
Michigan 
was 

pleased with the shutout, the 
team failed to move up in the 
conference 
standings 
with 

Sunday’s result, clinging to 
fourth place in the Big Ten 
after its fourth straight match 
without a win.

Despite the recent slump 

with two consecutive ties after 
back-to-back losses, Ryan sees 
the draw against Minnesota as 
a successful result for his team.

“Our focus is to get back 

in the NCAA Tournament, 
and getting a tie against a 
Minnesota team with a very 
high RPI is going to be one 
more result that really helps us 
do that,” Ryan said. “If we take 
care of the next two games like 
we’re capable of, I think it’ll 
pay off for our girls.”

Michigan will have its first 

opportunity to do just that 
Saturday against Ohio State 
in the Wolverines’ final home 
match of the season.

Wolverines lose heartbreaker

In front of a sell-out crowd 

Saturday night, the Michigan 
volleyball team (5-3 Big Ten, 16-4 
overall) 
clinged 
to 

a 
24-20 

lead in the 
fourth set of its match against 
No. 1 Wisconsin. The Wolverines 
had stormed back from a two-
set 
deficit 
to 
recapture 
the 

momentum of the match when 
freshman setter Mackenzi Welsh 
set up senior blocker Abby Cole, 
who hammered home a powerful 
kill to send the match to a fifth 
tiebreaker set.

But Michigan was unable to 

complete the comeback, falling 
13-15 to the Badgers in the final set, 
just missing out on a major upset.

“All week, we talked about how 

we want to respect every opponent 
… (but) the person we want to 
respect the most is ourselves,” 
said Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“We want to go in there and know 
that…we’re as good as anybody 
out there. I’m just really proud of 
how we battled tonight.”

Michigan took an early 6-3 lead 

in the first set on a kill by junior 
middle blocker Claire Kieffer-
Wright. But Michigan was unable 
to keep the advantage, and the 
two teams went back and in an 
opening frame that featured eight 
lead changes. A kill by Wisconsin 
standout Tionna Williams and 
a block error by Welsh gave the 
Badgers the first set.

In the second set, Wisconsin 

(7-1, 15-2) was outplaying the 
Wolverines with a .484 kill 
percentage. With the momentum 
not in their favor, Michigan let up 
to the Badgers, 18-25.

Down two games at that point, 

Michigan seemed unfazed to start 
the third set.

“I think it’s hard when you’re 

down 2-0,” Rosen said. “That can 
be a time when maybe you start to 
get a little passive, and we knew 

that wasn’t going to be a recipe for 
success.”

Junior outside hitter Adeja 

Lambert set the tone for a 
comeback with a kill to begin the 
third set. In a six-point stretch, 
kills from Welsh and senior 
outside hitter Ally Davis, blocks 
by Welsh and Kieffer-Wright, and 
a service ace from freshman libero 
Tiffany Clark gave Michigan a 
10-3 lead, and Wisconsin never 
fully recovered. The Badgers 
called their first timeout to stem 
the tide, but it wasn’t enough, as 
they lost the set, 25-17.

“I think it was just a turning 

point,” Cole said, 
“I was actually 
laughing 
with 

my 
teammates 

in the moment 
because one of our 
assistant coaches, 
Lisa, (had) turned 
to me and said, 
‘You need to find 
your hitter.’ ”

Michigan 

continued 
its 

strong play to start the fourth set, 
hitting a four-point stride. Kieffer-
Wright and Cole led with hitting 
percentages of .857 and .667, 
respectively, and Welsh recorded 
14 assists in the fourth set alone. 
Despite the loss of Lambert to a 
leg injury, the Wolverines never 
lost momentum. A .359 Michigan 
kill percentage led to a final score 
of 20-25, and it gave way to the 
deciding fifth set. 

“I think that’s something that’s 

making this team really compete 
well and grow well,” Rosen said. 
“…They’re 
focusing 
on 
what 

they can control. That’s a great 
example of something you can’t 
do anything about, so you just got 
to play through it.”

Then tied with the top-ranked 

Badgers, Michigan huddled up 
on the court as the energy of the 
crowd pulsed from all corners of 
Cliff Keen Arena.

Cole 
asserted 
Michigan’s 

confidence on the court on a first-

point kill. Following a kill from 
junior right-side hitter Katherine 
Mahlke and a service ace from 
Welsh, the Wolverines took a 
three-point lead. However, a 
service run by Wisconsin tied up 
the match, and the score danced 
back and fourth before Michigan 
tied it up again at 13-13 on a three-
point serving run by Welsh. 
Wisconsin, though, took the final 
two points to claim victory.

Rosen 
highlighted 
the 

performance of Welsh, who had 
49 overall assists and a career-
high 6 kills. He acknowledged that 
Welsh was up against the number 

one senior setter, 
Wisconsin’s 
Lauren 
Carlini, 

a first team All-
American 
who 

played 
on 
the 

national team.

“She’s 

just 
getting 

better 
every 

game,” 
Rosen 

said.“(She’s) 
a 

freshman 
(who 

is) learning really quickly. We’re 
seeing her grow up right before 
our eyes.

“They also came from the same 

club,” Rosen said, “… so you know 
that’s a big challenge for a player… 
Mackenzi was looking at that going, 
‘Hey, I want to go one-on-one with 
her’. … Watching her be in that 
moment and be as good as she was 
tonight, I’m really proud of her.”

Two of the three Big Ten 

matches the Wolverines have 
played 
have 
been 
against 

number 
one 
ranked 
teams, 

which illustrates the high level 
of competition Michigan is up 
against and promises a season 
devoid of dull moments.

“We’re playing in the best 

volleyball 
conference 
in 
the 

country,” Cole said. “You can’t 
overlook any team. You’re not 
guaranteed any wins … that in 
itself is motivating. We need to 
be very well prepared coming to 
every single match.”

VOLLEYBALL
Welsh serves as conductor for ‘M’

Though the term conductor 

is normally used in a musical 
context, there is no better 
role 
to 
describe 
freshman 

setter Mackenzi Welsh after 
her performance in a five-set 
loss to No. 1 Wisconsin. No. 18 
Michigan dropped the last set 
15-13, falling just short of an 
upset against the Badgers.

All night in front of a sold-

out crowd at Cliff Keen Arena, 
the cheers were deafening. But 
when Welsh came out of the 
huddle for the fifth and final 
set and tossed the ball up, the 
only thing deafening was the 
silence as Mackenzi Welsh 
connected the serve. Hitting 
the 
back-left 
corner, 
the 

serve sailed past an unaware 
defender for an ace.

Consistently, Welsh assisted 

her teammates to control the 
volume and momentum of the 
game — a performance that 
eventually garnered Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week honors. 
Returning to the court after 
intermission down two sets 
against the top-ranked team 
in the nation was not easy, but 
Welsh stayed aggressive.

“That might be a time when 

you get a little passive, and that 
wasn’t going to be the recipe for 
success.” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen.

With that in mind, Welsh 

helped set up her teammates to 
score, helping the Wolverines 
earn a 10-3 lead in the third set 
and maintain the upper hand 
throughout the set.

Welsh conducted the crowd 

with her performance as the 
Wolverines 
took 
set 
three 

and four. A kill by Welsh gave 
Michigan a 22-17 lead. Claps. 
A set from Welsh for a kill by 
Mahlke made it 23-17. Shouts. 
A serve from Welsh led to 
blocks from Katherine Mahlke 
and Abby Cole for a 24-17 lead. 
Cheers. Again, a serve from 
Welsh leading to a block for Cole 
on the top right corner of the 
court, 25-17. Screams.

In a game where momentum 

means everything, the tempo 
and pace of an offense can 
be 
the 
difference-maker. 

When 
Welsh 
conducted 

the 
offense, 
she 
avoided 

making 
it 
one-dimensional 

with her wide court vision 
in order to spot holes in the 
opposing 
formations 
and 

better 
matchups 
between 

her teammates and opposing 
blockers, such as placing Abby 
Cole on Wisconsin’s Haleigh 
Nelson and Kriskova, both 
shorter 
players. 
Her 
court 

awareness allowed her to make 
the smartest plays, from quick 
backsets to isolation plays for 
easy scores.

“We have a really balanced 

offense, so it’s easy to set any of 
them,” Welsh said.

In addition to oscillating 

between her types of assists, she 
also added herself to Michigan’s 
offensive threat. Notching a 
career-high six kills, she tallied 
two in a row to expand the lead 
in the third set to 22-17.

In addition to a career high in 

kills with an attack percentage 
of .750, Welsh also gained her 
fifth career assist-dig double-
double. She achieved 49 assists 
and 11 digs in five sets as well as 
a service ace.

One of the most important 

aspects of the match, though, 
was 
Welsh’s 
performance 

compared to the opposing 
setter. 
Wisconsin’s 
Lauren 

Carlini was a first-team All-
American, Big Ten Setter of 
the Year in 2015, and arguably 
the No. 1 setter in the nation. 
But on Saturday, all eyes were 
on Welsh.

“I know (Welsh) was looking 

at that going, ‘Hey, I wanna go 
one on one against her’,” Rosen 
said. “They came from the 
same club.”

Welsh viewed this as an 

opportunity to grow. She played 
her best against the No. 1 setter 
and ended up earning her second 
Big Ten Freshman of Week 
award. Young, talented and 
improving, Welsh continues to 
conduct the court as she steadily 
grows into a star player.

Cookies make dominance even sweeter

The Michigan football team’s 

defensive line conjures images 
of physical pain inflicted on 
quarterbacks, a toothless grin 
from one of its anchors and the 
sheer size of the dominant unit.

But it might come as a surprise 

to learn one of the ways defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 
Mattison 

motivates his squad — sweet 
treats.

“Coach Matty’s wife gives 

us cookies for sacks, tackles for 
losses, and there’s a new one — 
highest percentage,” said fifth-
year senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley. “And Ryan (Glasgow) 
has got it probably four or five 
out of six weeks, the highest-
percentage bag of cookies.”

Cookies might seem like an 

odd way to motivate a group that 
brings aggressive intentions into 
every game, but so far, it seems to 
be working.

Through 
six 
games, 
the 

Wolverines have racked up 59 
tackles for loss, 24 sacks and 
have 
chased 
four 
opposing 

quarterbacks out of the game. 
Wormley said the most cookies 
he has earned for a single 
game was three bags — which 
translates to about three dozen 
chocolate chip cookies — and 
that he usually tries to share 
the sweets with his teammates. 
(“Delano Hill usually steals 
them because he’s right next to 
me,” he added.)

But while the line competes for 

cookies, Wormley also pointed 
out that the unit has a marked 
cohesion to it this year. Prior to 
the season, it was easy for fans 
to fantasize about the prospect of 
rotating two similarly dominant 
complete lines. But halfway 
through the year, that’s been 
close to reality.

Perhaps the best example 

of the depth can be seen in 
Wormley. At his size and speed, 

he is capable of playing on both 
the interior and exterior of 
the line. He expected to play 
more inside coming into the 
year, but at the halfway mark, 
he has consistently been used 
at defensive end. Meanwhile, 
interior linemen Matt Godin, 
Maurice Hurst and Ryan Glasgow 
have 
combined 

for 
four 
sacks 

and 10.5 tackles 
for loss.

That 
diverse 

spread 
of 

production 
has 
given 
the 

entire unit more 
confidence.

“It’s cool to see 

Taco (Charlton) 
get a sack, and 
then Ryan Glasgow, who’s a nose 
tackle who usually doesn’t get 
the opportunity to make sacks, 
get sacks,” Wormley said. “And 
me, and Rashan (Gary), and Mo 
Hurst and Godin. So it’s cool to 

see everyone do that, and I think 
when we have that mentality 
and that confidence in ourselves 
that the (defensive backs) are 
going to give us time to get to the 
quarterback, we just make plays.”

When the Wolverines take on 

Illinois this weekend, they’ll be 
facing an offensive line that does 

a relatively good 
job of limiting 
those 
kinds 

of 
plays. 
The 

Fighting 
Illini 

are tied for 28th 
nationally 
with 

five tackles for 
loss allowed per 
game and tied 
for 46th with just 
two sacks allowed 
per game.

But against a defense like 

Michigan’s, those numbers are 
liable to inflate. Penn State is 
allowing just 1.8 sacks per game 
if you exclude the Wolverines, 
but in that game, Michigan 

tallied five.

The line relies on a trust and 

familiarity Wormley says has 
been building since the end of 
last season. But that feeling has 
grown stronger of late, and the 
results are clear.

“I know Taco’s going to do his 

job extremely well, and I look to 
my left and I know Matt or Mo is 
going to do their job perfectly,” 
Glasgow said. “So it’s like, ‘I’m 
going to do my job and I’m going 
to do it to the best of my ability.’ 
You don’t feel as if you have to 
compensate for anyone.”

And 
when 
it 
comes 
to 

compensation, Mattison’s wife 
might be onto something with 
her reward system. Normally, the 
players are rewarded for strong 
play with a sticker for the helmet. 
But to Wormley, the exclusive 
treats make that success even 
sweeter.

“Everyone 
gets 
helmet 

stickers,” Wormley said, “but 
(only) the D-Line gets cookies.”

Fifth-year senior defensive lineman Chris Wormley has four of the Michigan defense’s 24 sacks this season.

“Everyone gets 
helmet stickers, 

but (only we 
get) cookies.”
