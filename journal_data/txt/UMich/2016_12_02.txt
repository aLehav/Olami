The U.S.’s relationship with 

China 
relationship, 
fraught 

with 
friction 
and 
rising 

competition, will most likely 
not improve under President-
elect Donald Trump, according 
to 
David 
Shambaugh, 
a 

professor of political science 
and international affairs at 
George Washington University 
who spoke at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Thursday.

About 60 people gathered 

to listen to Shambaugh discuss 
his views on the state of U.S.-
China relations today and their 
projected evolution over coming 
decades. His lecture is the first 
of several organized by the 
Lieberthal-Rogel 
Center 
for 

Chinese Studies on U.S.-China 
relations over the next year in 
the context of the U.S. election, 
as well as upcoming changes in 
Chinese leadership next fall.

Shambaugh 
began 
his 

talk by noting that there is 
friction 
between 
the 
two 

nations, especially regarding 
the past and present U.S. 
presidents’ 
wishes 
to 
hold 

China accountable as a world 
power. 
Though 
Shambaugh 

said the Obama administration 
implemented policy generally 
continuous with actions of 
the 
Bush 
administration, 

Obama’s 
more 
left-leaning, 

internationally based policies 
lead to greater mistrust from 
the Chinese government.

“If there was a shift from 

Bush to Obama, it was Obama’s 
even greater embrace of the 
global governance dimension of 
the relationship,” he said.

However, Shambaugh added 

that though it is important 
to 
recognize 
the 
fraught 

nature 
of 
the 
U.S.-China 

relationship, there are also 
several 
positive 
dimensions 

and 
interdependencies 
that 

act as buffers between the 

competitive countries — such 
as billions of dollars in two-way 
trade, investments and export 
markets. He also emphasized 
the strong relationship between 
Michigan and cities in China.

“We’ve got sister city and 

sister 
state 
relationships, 

including 
Michigan’s 
own 

long-standing 
relationships 

in China,” Shambaugh said. 
“Governor Snyder’s done a great 
deal to increase that, but it goes 

back, in fact, to when I was a 
student here.”

But 
despite 
relationships 

between 
specific 
provinces 

and states, Shambaugh said 
two-thirds of the public in 
both countries view each other 
with mutual distrust due in 
part to the countries’ differing 
ideologies, as well as China’s 
rapidly growing commercial 
and political presence. He stated 

LoftSmart, a New York-based 

startup 
seeking 
to 
connect 

college students with off-campus 
housing, is hoping to make an 
impact in the Ann Arbor market. 

Sundeep Kumar, co-founder 

and 
chief 
operating 
officer, 

said the new website hosts off-
campus rental listings in college 
towns, including information, 
reviews and the ability to connect 
with the landlord and sign a lease 
online.

“If you think about it, a lot 

of 
students 
make 
(housing) 

decisions based on word of 
mouth, what friends have told 
them or what they have seen 
on street signs and stuff like 
that,” Kumar said. “At the end 
of the day, they might not know 
everything there is to know 
about that place.”

Co-founder and CEO Sam 

Bernstein 
formulated 
the 

original idea for the site at the 
University of Virginia and Kumar 
said he randomly met Bernstein 
in March of this year at a bar in 
Austin, Texas. Soon thereafter, 
Kumar formed a partnership

For the majority of refugees 

coming to the United States, the 
process of entering the country 
is long and difficult, especially 
for those who have experienced 
trauma and then have to prove 
it happened to gain asylum. 
However, according to a new 
University study, this burden of 
proving persecution or trauma is 
made considerably lighter with 
the provision of a professional 
medical examination.

Bridgette 
Carr, 
law 

professor and director of the 
Human Trafficking Clinic at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

said refugees have to provide 
substantial evidence of their 
persecution or trauma to be 
granted asylum. Trauma can 
range 
from 
domestic 
abuse, 

religious 
persecution 
or 

persecution because of sexuality 
or nationality.

“In America, asylum seekers 

can put themselves in one of 
two categories: They can have 
experienced persecution in the 
past, and that past persecution 
can be enough that they get

After two crime alerts for 

hate 
crimes 
occurred 
near 

the University of Michigan’s 
campus in Ann Arbor last 
month, Kinesiology sophomore 
Brianna Kennedy has started 
taking SafeRide, a free after-
hours transportation system, 
every night to get home after 
a full night of studying — and 
she’s not the only one taking 
extra precautions.

“(Walking home alone) is not 

something I would choose to do 
if I had the option not to with 
SafeRide or the bus,” Kennedy 
said. “I would choose that over 
walking home because of the 
recent incidents and all that’s 
been going on.”

On 
the 
Friday 
after 

President-elect Donald Trump’s 
win, a female Muslim student 
was approached by a man who 
demanded she take off her 
hijab, threatening to light her 
on fire if she refused. Days 
later, another female student 

was pushed down a hill after 
being ethnically intimidated 
on campus. As well, several 
incidents have occured that 
have not been sent out as alerts. 
Two weeks ago, an unknown 
man cut a woman’s face with 
a safety pin on East Liberty 
Street, four men assaulted a 
University lecturer and an Ann 
Arbor resident found swastikas 
drawn on his door.

Since 
the 
incidents 
and 

the 
subsequent 
increased 

in student demand for more 
safety resources, SafeRide has 
expanded its usual 10 p.m. to 2 
a.m. hours to 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., 
driving students within a one-
mile radius of the Central and 
North campuses.

“I think it’s helpful,” Kennedy 

said. “Just with it being winter 
and the fact that it gets darker 
earlier. So (the new hours) keep 
in mind the students.”

Steve 
Dolen, 
executive 

director 
of 
Logistics, 

Transportation and Parking, 
declined to cite the alerts as 
a reason for the expansion in

The the percentage of Black 

students 
at 
the 
University 

of Michigan decreased by a 
margin of 0.51 points for the 
2020 graduating class. At the 
same time, number of Hispanic-
identifying students rose by 0.82 
percent in this year’s freshman 
class, according to enrollment 
statistics released last month 
— an increase from 344 total 
students to 428.

The fluctiations followed a 

long-term trend of low minority 
enrollment at the University. 
Kedra Ishop, the vice provost 
for 
enrollment 
management, 

cites Proposal 2 — which banned 
Affirmative Action in the state — 
as a leading cause for low Black 
student enrollment. However, 
Ishop noted the University is 
still investigating other potential 
reasons for the decrease.

“We pursue many courses 

of action to improve diversity 
on 
campus, 
and 
some 
are 

unsuccessful,” Ishop said. “We 

are currently researching this 
decrease in African-American 
enrollment. We will be looking 
at what kinds of students we 
lost, and why we had fewer 
African-American students. Was 
it because of financial aid, was 
it because of program selection, 
was it because they got into 
Harvard? These are all things 
that we can use to inform us 
going forward.”

The ongoing decrease in Black 

student enrollment has been 
a cofus of student activity on 
campus for decade. It spiked in 

2013 #BBUM, where students 
shared their experiences of being 
Black at the University on Twitter. 
University 
alum 
Capri’Nara 

Kendall, former speaker of the 
Black Student Union, expressed 
frustration with the low Black 
and Latino student enrollment in 
an interview in 2015.

“Talk to me when minority 

enrollment is out of the 4 percent; 
when we’re looking at more of a 
7-percent enrollment for African 
Americans,” Kendall said in 2015. 
“We’re looking for more of a

Amid an ongoing recount 

of Michigan’s vote launched 
by 
Jill 
Stein, 
the 
former 

Green 
Party 
presidential 

nominee, 
University 
of 

Michigan professors and local 
Democrats are saying they 
think such efforts are highly 
unlikely to change the results 
of the election.

The 
race 
in 
Michigan 

was officially certified for 
President-elect Donald Trump 
Monday, 
with 
a 
winning 

margin of 10,704 votes.

Stein 
also 
filed 
in 

Wisconsin last week and is 
currently attempting to file 
in Pennsylvania, other states 
Trump won, for a recount.

Stein’s 
recount 
efforts 

are based on a suggestion 

by a group of researchers — 
including J. Alex Halderman, 
University 
of 
Michigan 

professor 
of 
electrical 

engineering 
and 
computer 

science — of potential vote 
manipulation in the three 
highly-contested states. She 
has stated she is aiming to 
ensure the integrity of the 
election.

The 
research 
team 
had 

initially attempted to persuade 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton to 
ask for a recount. However, 
the Clinton campaign has not 
independently 
sought 
any 

recount. It is participating in 
the efforts initiated by Stein in 
Wisconsin. 

Political 
Science 
Prof. 

Michael 
Traugott 
said 

there is almost no chance of 
overturning the results in 
Michigan, adding that this 

likely affected the Clinton 
campaign’s hesitancy to call 
for a recount.

“I think the chances are 

zero,” Traugott said. “That 
is because administering an 
election is a fairly complicated 
administrative activity but a 
set of procedures have been 
put in place to minimize the 
chances of error.”

State Republican operatives 

have challenged the recounts, 
stating 
they 
don’t 
believe 

there were any problems with 
the vote count in Michigan.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

chair 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
wrote in an email interview 
that he does not believe a 
recount 
will 
be 
effective 

in changing the election’s 
results.

“While we accept the results 
of the election, we also 
understand that recounts are 
part of the election process,” 
Kelly 
wrote. 
“Increasing 

transparency and verifying 
results do not undermine 
the 
election 
or 
signify 

doubts about the outcome. 
Michigan was an extremely 
close election, and while 
we don’t expect the results 
to change, we are happy 
this recount will provide 
more transparency in the 
election.”

The University’s chapter 

of College Republicans didn’t 
respond immediately to a 
request for comment.

The outcome in all three 

states Stein is attempting 
to contest would have to be 
flipped to Clinton to change 
the election outcome.

Traugott said that in the 

unlikely 
scenario, 
Trump 

would have no legal grounds 
to contest the result further 
though Clinton has conceded.

Friday, December 2, 2016 — 3

hours in an e-mail interview.

“I couldn’t speculate that (the 

ride increase was due to the fear 
from crime alerts),” he wrote. 
“The data doesn’t show that.”

Dolen wrote the new start time 

for SafeRide is a pilot and will be 
evaluated as it progresses.

“We 
will 
keep 
track 
of 

demand,” he wrote in an email 
interview. “Whether or not it 
will be permanent is still (to be 
determined).” 

According to Dolen, SafeRide 

currently has three operating 
vans. While the University is not 
looking into adding a fourth van, 
he wrote that three vans have 
been enough to cover student 
demand. SafeRide is generally 
requested a thousand times per 
month and increases during the 
month of November when the 
weather starts to get colder.

SafeRide 
is 
not 
the 
only 

transportation 
system 
the 

University offers. Ride Home 
also runs from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m., 
providing free shared taxis from 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 

Library. 
State 
Street 
Ride 

functions as another service, 
transporting 
students 
to 
the 

South State Street Commuter, 
and runs from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
Monday through Friday.

Diane 
Brown, 
Division 
of 

Public 
Safety 
and 
Security 

spokeswoman, 
said 
SafeRide 

was derived from an earlier 
concept of SafeWalk, a campus 
accompaniment service for those 
who do not want to walk alone 
on campus at night, in the early 
2000s. The University began 
offering rides in the SafeWalk 
program in 2001. She said there 
is talk of reviving the program 
again for the upcoming months, 
but they are not finalized.

Students 
have 
also 
been 

planning 
programs 
similar 

to 
SafeWalk, 
independently 

organizing 
walking 
systems 

and providing support to others 
after hours. Emma Kaye, an LSA 
and Business senior, had been 
planning for a buddy system night 
since the beginning of the year 
in hopes of spreading awareness 
about the prevalence of sexual 
assault on campus.

However, she said her plans 

changed due to the crime alerts 
on campus and her sense of 
heightened 
xenophobia 
on 

campus following the election.

“Part way through (the week 

of elections) ... we started getting 
those crime alerts and they were 
talking about things going on 
campus,” she said. “I think that 
sparked something within us 
and in our volunteers as well. 
Obviously, it is a horrifying thing; 
we felt like it became more about 
safety in general on campus rather 
than only about sexual assault.”

Trump’s win sparked negative 

reactions from many University 
students over worries about his 
campaign rhetoric, with multiple 
student protests on campus in 
the weeks following his victory. 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel appeared at one of the 
events, 
applauding 
University 

students 
for 
overwhelmingly 

supporting 
Democratic 

presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton.

“Ninety 
percent 
of 
you 

rejected the kind of hate and the 
fractiousness and the longing for 
some kind of idealized version 
of 
a 
nonexistent 
yesterday 

that was expressed during the 
campaign,” Schlissel said during 
the November protest.

Kaye said she and three other 

friends launched a walking night 
a few weeks after the election. 
The volunteers, she explained, 
had 30-minute shifts and worked 
in teams of two, with both male 
and female students in the pair. 
On their first night, she said, the 

group walked about 25 students 
home, the majority of them 
female.

“One of the greatest responses 

we got was from a guy who came 
and volunteered and what he 
said encompassed everything we 
wanted from the night too,” she 
said. “He said, ‘Look, as a man, 
I don’t deal with this or feel this 
fear. I don’t feel afraid walking on 
this campus and with everything 
going on now and especially as 
a white male, I don’t feel that.’ 
And he said it was extremely 
eye-opening to see how much 
people needed this and to feel to 
understand what other people 
went through even if it is a little 
bit.”

Kaye said even a student who 

declined to be walked home 
volunteered to help other students 
and expressed his gratitude for 
the service.

“I didn’t expect the response 

that it got,” she said. “Probably 
one of the greatest experiences 
I have had in this University 
was having my friends and even 
these people I didn’t know really 
back this up and show a lot of 
support.”

The group’s hope was to start 

a culture of supporting other 
students, making it a norm to 
walk others home and check up 
on friends regularly.

“It’s not that this one night was 

going to solve it,” she said. “It’s 
not. It was hoping to show that 
this is a problem. And even if a 
couple of people started asking if 
they want to be walked home and 
even to strangers, I would think 
that would be a success.”

She noted frustrations with 

current University services like 
SafeRide, saying she believed it 
to be a useful resource but, in 
her experience, there was a 30- 
to 40-minute wait time, leading 
some students to avoid the 
service.

Dolen 
wrote 
there 
is 
an 

application for SafeRide that was 

launched this fall that could aid 
the frustration of waiting for the 
ride. The app will also suggest 
other ways to get home that could 
be faster than the SafeRide.

“Another piece that we are 

just getting launched (in the 
application) is when you choose a 
ride it will also let you know when 
the next bus would be arriving 
and if it may be closer to you,” 
Dolen wrote. “So if the SafeRide 
van can’t be there in 15 minutes, 
there might be a bus and the bus 
stop would be just outside if you 
were to stay in Shapiro. There 
might be a bus getting there in 
10 minutes and it is going pretty 
close to the same location.”

Evelyn 
Alsultany, 
associate 

professor of Arab and Muslim 
American Studies, is the head of 
the Islamophobia Working Group, 
another organization on campus 
aiming to make the walk home 
more comfortable for students. 
The group is currently building a 
way to have specialized walking 
systems for Muslim students, 
as many felt Islamophobia on 
campus after the female student 
wearing the hijab was threatened.

“After the recent hate crimes, 

we updated the resource list 
to include information on safe 
rides 
since 
many 
students 

are fearful of walking alone 
on campus, especially female 
students who wear the hijab,” 
Alsultany wrote in an email. “The 
Muslim Students’ Association is 
facilitating a system of walking 
in pairs and groups, especially at 
night.”

LSA junior Haleemah Aqel, 

part of the Islamophobia Working 
Group’s 
student 
initiative, 

said she is working with the 
Muslim 
Students’ 
Association 

representatives 
to 
create 
a 

walking system for those who feel 
unsafe walking home at night.

“We sent out reminders after 

the first crime alert like, ‘Hey, 
remember not to walk home at 
night. Make sure you are always 

walking home with a buddy,’ ” she 
said.

The MSA’s Facebook page 

currently has a list of phone 
numbers of students willing to 
walk people home.

“I am definitely hoping this is 

something we can keep for the 
future,” Aqel said. “I know that a 
lot of these initiatives have come 
out of aftermath of the election. 
But I think in general, safety 
should be considered. Whatever 
the politics and climate around 
our (campus) is, safety should 
always be something. Because 
who knows what could happen? 
Because this could be a great 
system for the future, maybe 10 
years from now.”

Aqel said overall, the crime 

alerts were a sad reminder about 
the general sentiment toward 
Muslims in the United States.

“It’s sad to say I am not 

surprised that happened because 
of the climate not only on 
campus but in the U.S.,” she said. 
“Xenophobia is such a prevalent 
issue 
in 
our 
society. 
These 

instances are so ‘Wow I can’t 
believe this,’ but at the same time 
I can. It was bound to happen.”

Another 
organized 
effort 

to 
create 
walking 
systems, 

Wolverine 
Guard, 
has 
also 

launched in the past weeks and 
has a list of phone numbers 
on Facebook similar to MSA’s 
approach.

Faculty 
have 
also 
gotten 

involved — a team of faculty 
recently launched Teamworks, 
a Canvas site that provides 
resources 
and 
support 
for 

students.

Anne Berg, assistant director 

of undergraduate studies and 
the organizer of Teamworks, 
said the site was created after a 
graduate student told her some 
of her students wouldn’t come to 
class the Friday after the election 
because they were too scared 
to be on campus. Berg said she 
attended post-election events to 

hear from students as well.

“I went to the meeting that 

Dean 
Martin 
organized 
for 

students and spoke with a bunch 
of students there, on the Monday 
after the election,” Berg said. 
“And many said that they were 
terrified walking around campus 
— that was just after the woman 
was threatened. … People were 
really, really raw in general.”

Berg said she hopes Teamworks 

can stay in place for the long term. 
After presenting the idea to the 
administration, the site is set to 
be a trial run to see how students 
respond to it.

“(Students) said that something 

faculty monitored would give 
them a better sense of security 
because 
what 
students 
have 

done is quickly set up Facebook 
groups,” she said.

The Canvas site currently has 

30 members, most of whom are 
students.

Berg said building a community 

within Teamworks would help 
create 
a 
more 
comfortable 

space, adding that the team was 
interested in planning events 
to allow more networking. She 
added that she thought it was the 
job of students and faculty alike 
to keep both the walking system 
and the general climate of campus 
safe and supportive.

“I 
think 
what 
is 
really 

important 
in 
this 
political 

situation is that students of color, 
minority students, for whatever 
reason they feel, it is not upon 
them to stake their claims and 
be safe,” she said. “But rather it is 
for everyone on campus to make 
sure we are a community and we 
belong together. And the type of 
rhetoric and actions has no place 
in Michigan. I think there really 
is a responsibility of students who 
do feel safe and faculty as well 
to offer themselves as a resource 
and to be there and say, ‘This is 
our community and we are here 
to defend it. We won’t let this 
destroy us.’ ”

7-percent enrollment for Latino 
students.”

The Black Student Union and 

Students4Justice both declined 
to comment.

Latina student organizations, 

like the Lambda Theta Alpha 
Latin 
sorority, 
expressed 

optimism due to the increase in 
Hispanic 
student 
enrollment. 

Roxana Taginya, an LSA junior 
affiliated with Lambda Theta 
Alpha, noted the importance 
of 
enrolling 
more 
Hispanic 

students each year to the Latino 
community

“Given my work with the 

Latin@ 
community 
here 
on 

campus, being able to see the 
enrollment numbers for incoming 
Latin@s increase has been really 
amazing,” Taginya wrote in an 
email interview. “I personally 
have done a lot of work to build 
the Latin@ community here on 
campus and I find that there is 
strength in numbers.”

However, 
Taginya, 
despite 

feeling 
optimistic 
about 
the 

class of 2020’s increased Latino 
student enrollment, wrote that 
she hopes the increasing trend 
will continue going forward.

“Seeing more Latin@s on 

campus 
means 
a 
stronger 

network and a larger community 
through 
which 
incoming 

students 
can 
feel 
welcome,” 

Taginya 
wrote. 
“However, 
I 

hope that this increase continues 
from year to year because I 
believe there is a lot of work to 
be done at this school in terms 
of diversity, equity, and inclusion 
and a greater presence from the 
Latin@ community would make 
a huge difference.”

Despite the mixed record 

of 
success 
in 
increasing 

representation 
for 
all 

demographics, Ishop said she 
thought the University’s efforts 
to improve economic diversity for 
the freshman class was reflected 
in enrollment figures.

“We are looking for diversity 

across all lines,” Ishop said. 
“This includes socioeconomic 
diversity as well. One of our 
goals is to make an education 
here accessible not just to the 
wealthiest students, but also 
to low and moderate income 
students. In order to achieve 
this, we put a lot of money into 
our financial aid departments so 
that cost — as much as we can 
control for — is not the reason 
why somebody who is accepted 
does not attend the University.”

For the class of 2020, the 

University increased budgeting 
for financial aid by 10.8 percent, 
according to a University press 
release, including a total of $170 
million 
allocated 
specifically 

for 
need-based 
financial 
aid 

packages.

One of the factors Ishop 

attributed to the improvement 
in 
economic 
diversity 
was 

the 
introduction 
of 
the 

HAIL scholarship, which is a 
scholarship designed for high-
achieving 
and 
low-income 

students from Michigan.

“The 
HAIL 
scholarship 

is a terrific example of our 
deliberate 
efforts 
to 
bring 

in 
people 
from 
different 

backgrounds 
and 
of 
our 

efforts to inform prospective 
applicants that a Michigan 
education can be affordable,” 
Ishop said. “And this wasn’t 
necessarily 
a 
policy-driven 

change, but more of a shift 
in messaging. We want high 
achieving students to know 
that you should still apply even 
if you are unsure of how to pay 
for college because cost should 
not be a factor. The University 
can help you need.”

with Bernstein, quit his full-
time job at Dell and became a 
co-founder of LoftSmart.

Earlier 
this 
year, 
Kumar 

said the company received $1.7 
million in funding from venture 
capital firms, letting LoftSmart 
develop into an online platform 
in which students can complete 
the whole housing process in one 
place, including read reviews, 
apply for housing, get screened 
for credit and criminal history, 
sign a legally binding lease and 
submit a deposit.

Kumar 
said 
while 
the 

company 
initially 
gained 

traction at University of Virginia 
and colleges in Texas, it has 
seen increased usage in the Ann 
Arbor market since launching 
three months ago, with property 
reviews on the site growing from 
zero to about 500 in that time 
period.

“We’ve seen a lot of good 

traction at Michigan, actually,” 
Kumar said. “Landmark, the 
Zaragons, 411, ArborBlu and the 
Courtyards can all be booked; 
you can basically take care of 
that entire process through 
LoftSmart.”

Kumar said the company 

interviewed students from the 
University and heard horror 
stories about problematic leasing 
in Ann Arbor, including times 
when students had to pay extra 
fees, didn’t get their security 
deposits back or weren’t satisfied 
with their properties.

“Our first and main goal is to 

help be almost a representative 
for them and act as a third 
party where they can sign 
through us and really gain a 
sense of security, a sense of 
trustworthiness and definitely 
a sense of convenience,” Kumar 
said.

Currently, 
Kumar 
said, 

LoftSmart 
is 
focused 
on 

connecting 
students 
with 

apartments, but in the future, 
they are looking to expand into 
houses and also facilitate greater 

relationships 
between 

students and property managers.

“There 
are 
so 
many 

opportunities — the goal is to 
kind of take over that entire 
rental market in Ann Arbor, get 
not only apartments but also 
houses and any other rental 
units,” Kumar said. “We’d like 
to also help students manage the 
relationship with the property 
managers and allow for a lot 
more transparency.”

He added this philosophy 

ties in with the goal of making 
sure students who don’t have 
experience with signing leases 
aren’t being taken advantage of.

“The 
housing 
market 
for 

students 
is 
very 
interesting 

because you’re dealing with 
people that are newcomers to 
the market and there is a lot of 
room to kind of take advantage 
of them,” Kumar said. “We want 
to empower students to not only 
make better decisions but to 
ensure they are picking places 
that will take care of them.”

Business sophomore Connor 

Baechler, who recently secured 

a house for his off-campus 
living accommodation next year, 
said he could have benefited 
from a more straightforward 
relationship with the realtor and 
rental company.

During his search, Beachler 

said, he knocked on the door of 
the property he was interested in 
three separate times so he could 
talk to the current tenants about 
the property and what their 
relationship with the landlord 
was like.

“I had to go to the house I 

was interested in and speak 
with tenants,” Baechler said. 
“It would have been much more 
convenient had there been an 
easier way to reach out to them.”

Baechler said he had never 

heard of LoftSmart, but thinks 
it is an intriguing idea and might 
be inclined to utilize it in the 
future.

“If it catches on I’ll have more 

trust in a company like that, so 
I’d be curious to see how it plays 
out and the reputation they build 
here in Ann Arbor,” Baechler 
said.

multiple times throughout the 
talk that the tension between the 
two countries should be seen as a 
new normal.

“While 
regrettable, 
this 

negativity, I think, is to be 
expected,” he said. “We China 
specialists, or social scientists, 
should not be surprised by this, 
and moreover, I think it’s the new 
normal. We have to get used to it. 
This is the natural paradigm, not 
some sort of false, cooperative, 
harmonious paradigm.”

Shambaugh also discussed 

how Trump’s presidency will 

affect 
U.S.-China 
relations. 

Though Trump has called for 
increased tariffs on Chinese 
goods and the labeling of China 
as 
a 
currency 
manipulator, 

Shambaugh 
noted 
that 
the 

president-elect has offered little 
in terms of other foreign policy. 
Despite 
Trump’s 
isolationist 

rhetoric, he said he doubts 
the president-elect will walk 
away from a trade deal like the 
North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which Trump said 
he may do during his campaign.

“I would highly doubt a Trump 

admin will walk away from 
these 
alliances,” 
Shambaugh 

said. “Isolationist rhetoric would 
meet resistance, if he wanted to 

pull away from Asia and NATO.”

Though Shambaugh noted 

multiple variables behind the 
increasing tensions between the 
United States and China, such as 
rising Chinese national identity 
and the United States’ position 
in the Asian-Pacific region, he 
ended his discussion on a lighter 
note.

“This is a transitional time; 

the relationship is categorized 
by 
rising 
competition 
and 

predominant 
competition, 

secondary cooperation but it’s 
not about to go off the cliff,” he 
said. “Since 1972, and through 
nine American presidents and 
eight Chinese leaders, this is 
not the first time we have had 

frictions. We have had them in 
the past, and the relationship has 
continued to endure and grow to 
both societies’ benefit.”

Rackham student Ding He 

said she felt the talk made a 
variety of perspectives on the 
U.S.-China relationship more 
clear.

“I think because I read a lot 

of articles about the relationship 
between America and China, so 
this one is like how the people 
from the policy committees 
think about the relationship,” 
He said. “So actually I’ve heard 
these kinds of opinions in China a 
lot, so this is just to confirm some 
of the ideas and information that 
I have taken from before.”

asylum, or they can have had no 
persecution but they can prove 
that they have a well-founded 
fear of future persecution,” she 
said. “If they prove that they 
truly are at risk, that their fear 
is well-founded both subjectively 
and objectively that they will be 
persecuted if returned, they can 
receive asylum.”

In the United States, refugees 

can apply for asylum for both 
themselves 
and 
their 
family 

by filing a Form I-589, which 
prevents them from being forced 
to leave. Once an individual 
is granted asylum, they are 
permitted to work and live in the 
United States in the same way as 
a natural-born citizen.

Elizabeth Scruggs, a third-

year medical student who was 
the first author of the new 
study and is a member of the 
UM Asylum Collaborative, said 
based on their findings, medical 
examinations appear to be a 

key part of applying to another 
country. 
The 
UM 
Asylum 

Collaborative is a student-led 
initiative that “mobilizes health 
professionals to advocate for 
victims and survivors of human 
rights violations.”

“Our 
study, 
given 
that 

it’s 
qualitative, 
can’t 
make 

any 
definitive 
or 
statistical 

statement, 
but 
really 
every 

lawyer we’ve spoken to agreed 
that it’s a key or crucial piece of 
the application,” Scruggs said. 
“It’s 
something 
that 
should 

always be present, but often is 

not present simply because of 
lack of access, lack of resources 
or simply lack of a physician to 
perform the evaluation.”

Carr, though not a researcher 

in the study, said she agreed 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
a 

medical exam.

“If you’re doing a female 

genital mutilation case and you 
don’t have a medical affidavit 
from a doctor in the U.S. 
examining your client that says 
it’s happened to her, if that’s your 
claim of past persecution, you 
won’t win,” she said.

Even 
in 
cases 
where 
no 

physical proof of past abuse 
remains, a medical exam can 
greatly boost a refugee’s chances 
of 
being 
granted 
asylum, 

according to the study. Scruggs 
said psychological exams play an 
important role in corroborating 
a refugee’s story and assessing 
for the clinical findings of post-
traumatic stress disorder.

Most refugees aren’t afforded 

this 
chance, 
however, 
as 

obtaining a medical exam as a 
refugee can be very difficult.

“You’re not entitled to a 

lawyer,” Carr said. “If you are not 
represented by a lawyer, what 
you can bring forward might be 
pretty minimal, and if you’re 
represented by a lawyer or an 
NGO that has a ton of resources, 
then what they can cobble 
together will be fundamentally 
different. I would say that for 
the majority of clients who seek 
asylum, the majority of their 
evidence is their testimony.”

O

ver 
Thanksgiving 

break, I went to see 
the new coming-of-age 

film, “The Edge of Seventeen,” 
expecting 
to 

see 
myself 
in 

Hailee 
Steinfeld’s 

awkward, 
selfish, 

yet entirely relatable 
protagonist, Nadine. 
And I did, doubling 
over with laughter 
at her over-the-top 
antics 
and 
long-

winded wit that are 
nothing but normal 
for a teenage girl. 
However, 
I 
found 

my endearment unexpectedly 
stolen by newcomer Hayden 
Szeto, the lone face of color in 
a nearly all-white cast (Hailee 
Steinfeld and movie-brother 
Blake Jenner have Filipino and 
Cuban roots, respectively, but 
they are portrayed as white in 
the film). 

Rarely do I get to see an 

Asian face in Hollywood, and 
when I do, they’re usually 
typecast into some variation 
of the goofy, geeky sidekick 
who excels in school and 
maybe takes up martial arts 
as an extracurricular. Though 
Szeto’s adorably nervous, boy-
next-door 
character, 
Erwin 

Kim, could have easily become 
the clichéd Hollywood Asian 
male, the movie makes it 
clear that Erwin is just “your 
average 
guy,” 
even 
poking 

fun at such stereotypes when 
Nadine tries to pigeonhole him 
as a stereotypical Asian with 
a mother who “owns a small 
restaurant downtown” and a 
“quiet, gruff father who never 
says ‘I love you.’ ” 

Despite that, Erwin spends 

most of the film ignored by 
the leading lady, who goes 
for the cooler “bad boy” Nick, 
potentially falling in line with 
Hollywood’s 
emasculation 

of Asian men. So imagine 
my 
surprise 
and 
delight 

when he takes his shirt off 
to 
reveal 
a 
swoon-worthy 

physique that falls in line with 
American standards of male 
attractiveness 
and 
(spoiler 

alert) wins the girl in the end. 

Let’s face it: Hollywood 

has not properly represented 
my people and our stories. 
Directors and producers claim 

that there are no 
big Asian stars to 
feature in their films 
as an explanation for 
their whitewashing, 
but the argument is 
circular: How can 
Asians ever establish 
themselves as stars if 
they are never even 
given a chance?

Asian 
Americans 

have 
long 
seen 

themselves 
erased 

or ridiculed in Western media. 
Take, for example, “Breakfast 
at Tiffany’s,” the movie I’d 
watched the day prior for my 
family’s 
post-Thanksgiving 

dinner tradition of watching 
old Audrey Hepburn movies. 
In all my times of watching 
the film, this year was the first 
year I realized just how racist 
and offensive Mickey Rooney’s 
portrayal of the Japanese Mr. 
Yunioshi was. Not only did 
Rooney tape his eyelids and 
wear yellowface (because God 
forbid an actual Asian person 
play an Asian character), but he 
also sported a ridiculous accent 
and persona that established the 
“Asian” Yunioshi as nothing but 
a caricature, a joke. 

But, Ashley!, one might cry out, 

“Breakfast at Tiffany’s” came 
out more than 50 years ago, long 
before all this political correctness 
nonsense came about! That may 
be true, but how can the racist 
ignorance of the ’60s really 
be a defense when Hollywood 
so recently disappointed the 
Asian-American community by 
casting the white Emma Stone 
as a quarter-Chinese, quarter-
Native American fighter pilot in 
Sony’s 2015 “Aloha” and Scarlett 
Johansson 
as 
lead 
Motoko 

Kusanagi 
in 
the 
upcoming 

adaption of the Japanese manga 
“Ghost in the Shell”? 

So Szeto’s role in “The Edge 

of Seventeen” may seem like a 
small thing to most, but to me, 
an Asian love interest in a big 
box-office movie is the hope I 
need that Hollywood is taking 

a step in the right direction. Of 
course, Szeto’s portrayal in the 
film is not perfect. After all, 
he’s a Chinese actor playing a 
Korean character, a common 
occurrence in this industry 
that perpetuates the racist 
sentiment that all Asians are the 
same and that our ethnicities 
are 
interchangeable. 
“Teen 

Wolf” is guilty of that practice, 
casting Korean Arden Cho as 
the Japanese Kira Yukimura in 
order to tap into Japanese lore, 
as is “Once Upon a Time” for 
casting Korean Jamie Chung as 
the Chinese Mulan. However, 
that’s a detail I can overlook for 
the opportunity to see my race 
represented on the big screen. 
Baby steps. With the success of 
ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat,” the 
first television show about an 
Asian-American family in 20 
years, and Steven Yeun’s Glenn 
Rhee being a fan favorite on 
“The Walking Dead,” there is 
hope that my children will be 
able to turn on the TV and see 
their lives and stories reflected 
back to them. 

And I don’t want just one 

revolutionary show that counts 
as our “representation.” I want 
Asians — and all people of color 
— integrated into mainstream 
media not as token minorities, 
but as normal people among 
a 
multicultural 
cast 
that 

accurately 
represents 
the 

diversity in America today. Let 
us be the protagonist. Let us 
be the love interest. Let us be 
the hero, the antagonist and 
the three-dimensional morally 
ambiguous middleman. 

What 
Hollywood 
needs 

to understand is that we are 
all human, and when we’re 
stripped bare, we bleed red 
just like the rest of the world. 
Asians are not all special, super 
geniuses or completely devoid 
of sex appeal. No, we are just 
normal people, and we, too, 
fall in love, make mistakes and 
have stories worth sharing. You 
know, normal people things.

The last registration

MICHAEL SUGERMAN | COLUMN

I 

registered 
for 
the 
final 

classes of my undergraduate 
career Wednesday morning, 

and only as I wrote 
this sentence did it hit 
me how odd that is.

Class registration 

is routine — a twice-
a-year activity that, 
in 
its 
mechanical 

regularity, 
has 

become 
a 
subtle 

source of comfort. 
Class 
registration 

means 
that 
I’m 

returning 
to 
Ann 

Arbor, and all that 
doing so entails. After next 
semester, 
my 
routine 
will 

change. That’s jarring.

It’s not just the courses I’ve 

taken, the papers I’ve written or 
the all-nighters I’ve pulled.

It’s the drive into Ann Arbor 

from the airport, and the swell 
of joy that comes with whizzing 
down 
Washtenaw, 
past 
the 

Arborland sign and the Rock and 
South U and the Hill en route to 
finishing a 2,300-mile journey 
from Los Angeles to Kerrytown.

It’s my house. The drafty 

walls 
and 
creaky 
radiators. 

The old futon Casey brought 
from Grand Rapids that has a 
lovable, gaping hole on its right 
side — which is actually really 
comfortable if you know where 
to put the pillows. The box of 
175 York Peppermint Patties, 
replenished each semester by 
my grandmother, that sits on the 
mantle in our living room. The 
stacks of frozen burritos Matt 
keeps in our freezer, occupying 
at least 25 percent of the space. 
The dirty coils on our gas stove, 
and all the times we cooked 
chicken breasts, green beans 
and boxed mashed potatoes on 
them. The porch swing where 
I’ve been content to sit and sway 
for hours.

It’s sangria at Dominick’s, 

or a fishbowl at Charley’s. The 

party that turns into a trip to 
Rick’s (or as my buddy Joe calls 
it, “the Café”) that turns into 

a trip to Backroom 
Pizza, where no one 
ever knew a crappy 
$1 slice could taste 
so 
good. 
It’s 
the 

quiet evenings when 
making a homemade 
meal, playing a game 
of 
Scrabble 
and 

binge-watching 
a 

Netflix show with 
good friends is more 
satisfying than any 
night out.

It’s the Big House. The sea of 

maize. The disappointing losses 
of freshman and sophomore 
year. The electric revival of 
junior and senior year. The 
deafening voices screaming in 
unison and echoing across the 
field. Fire Hoke. Free Jabrill. 
Let’s Go Harbaugh. You Suck. 
Let’s Go Blue. The “bullshit” 
chants 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan (and subsequently, 
the band) doesn’t want national 
television to hear. The wave, at 
all speeds. The Blues Brothers 
dance. Mumbling and making 
up words to “Varsity” at the 
end of a win because none of us 
know them.

It’s walking through campus 

and the city. Throwing a Frisbee 
to a friend, or a gaze at the fall 
foliage in the Arb. Making sure 
to hop over the class of 1953’s 
Block ‘M’ at the Diag’s core, and 
staring down an emboldened, fat 
squirrel in the process. Admiring 
the Bell Tower, and wondering 
why the hell a column with a 
clock on it is so beautiful to 
look at as the sun sets. Heading 
downtown and strolling around 
Main Street.

It’s the winter. The rain, 

which turns to hail, which turns 
to snow, which turns to slush, 
which turns to ice. The wind 
blowing impossibly in every 

direction, so no matter which 
way you look, your hood flies 
off and the weather slaps you 
in the face. The slightly-more-
aggressive-than-two-hand-
touch football game, because the 
snow is thick and tackling makes 
it more legitimate, somehow. 
The late-night sledding with 
trays smuggled out of dining 
halls on Palmer Field and 
outside the Medical Center 
Plaza. The reprieve of spring, 
when the ubiquitous white melts 
away to reveal the green below. 
The first afternoon when it’s 
warm enough to sunbathe, even 
though it’s just 50 degrees. The 
next week where it paradoxically 
snows again, just as a small 
middle finger from the Mitten.

Choosing 
my 
last 
set 

of 
classes 
was 
stressful. 

Inherently, there existed the 
pressure to balance picks that 
satisfy the pesky, remaining 
distribution requirements and 
others that stimulate fledgling 
academic interests I’ll only 
have time to explore in depth 
as a college student.

Registration 
is 
always 

important, but if we’re being 
honest, it’s usually a mundane 
task in which our options are all-
but-determined by the context 
of our majors.

This time was different. The 

choices felt more consequential, 
because it was the last time I’d 
be making them — and “lasts” 
carry the weight of everything 
that has prefaced them. It’s easy 
to feel paralyzed by the gravity 
of moments like these, but I’ve 
found it’s healthier to consider 
that the reason they feel so 
heavy is because the “preface” 
was so meaningful.

All things considered, then, 

I’m happy. And I’m not just 
talking about classes.

 Stop construction of the DAPL
O 

ver the past several months, protests over construction of 
the Dakota Access Pipeline have grown from a whisper to a 
feverous roar, both on campus and across the nation. Celebrities, 

concerned citizens and many University of Michigan students have 
joined the #NoDAPL movement, which supports the Standing Rock 
Sioux Tribe of North Dakota who have led the movement. Protesters 
have been challenging the pipeline’s path, slated to pass under the 
Standing Rock Sioux’s main source of water, the Missouri River, and 
through significant spiritual land. Adding to the controversy, growing 
protest camps in Standing Rock have been met with water hoses and 
tear gas from police forces. Because of the unacceptable environmental 
hazards of oil pipelines, the threat the DAPL poses to water sources for 
the Sioux and the persistent violation of the Sioux’s sovereign rights, 
we oppose any further construction of the DAPL.

The 
pipeline 
is 
being 

built in what is now an era 
of dangerously rising global 
temperatures 
and 
contempt 

for 
the 
reality 
of 
climate 

change at the highest levels 
of government, most recently 
manifested in President-elect 
Donald Trump’s appointment 
of a climate change denier 
to lead the transition at the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency. 
Oil 
pipelines, 
in 

general, present environmental 
risks, 
and 
the 
DAPL 

specifically presents deeply 
unnecessary risks to both 
local ecologies and a vital 
water source that runs from 
North 
Dakota 
to 
Illinois. 

The 
International 
Energy 

Agency has found that oil 
pipelines nationwide spilled 
three 
times 
the 
volume 

of oil as trains — another 
method of transporting oil 
which carries it’s own risks 
to local communities and the 
environment — between 2004 
and 2012. A major stakeholder 
of the DAPL, Enbridge Inc., 
built the disastrous Line 6B, 
which 
dumped 
1.2 
million 

gallons of crude oil into the 
Kalamazoo River, and crude oil 
spills from pipelines have been 
shown to harm the environment 
for 
years 
after 
the 
initial 

spill. The DAPL threatens the 
viability of the Sioux tribe’s 
water intake for 70 miles down 
the Missouri River.

The proven dangers of oil 

transport pipelines call into 
question the Army Corps of 
Engineers’ 
environmental 

impact 
assessment 
of 
the 

pipeline that the federal agency 
released before building began. 
Both the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, the federal agency 
responsible for issuing permits 
for 
construction 
projects 

on and near waterways, and 
Dakota 
Access 
LLC, 
the 

branch of Energy Transfer 
Partners building the pipeline, 
conducted 
risk 
assessments 

and reported that no significant 
environmental 
or 
cultural 

impact was found. However, 
the pipeline assessment relied 
on an outdated 1985 survey 
of the land that the pipeline 
would run through, which the 
Sioux claim omits important 
burial sites and sacred land, 
meaning their risk assessments 
may be largely invalid. In 
addition, 
the 
Army 
Corps 

classified the pipeline in such 
a way that allowed it to issue a 
special Nationwide Permit 12. 
This permit process allowed the 
pipeline to only be assessed in 
areas where it crossed federally 
protected lands, bypassing laws 
intended to preserve culturally 

significant lands and letting 
it be built with little federal 
authorization 
and 
oversight 

from the Army Corps.

In addition to the damage oil 

spills inflict on local ecologies, 
the DAPL represents a step 
backward in the shift toward 
renewable energy the United 
States should continue to make. 
In 2016, job creation in the 
solar energy field grew 12 times 
as fast as overall jobs in the 
United States and surpassed oil 
and coal jobs. Though Trump 
has said he would support the 
pipeline under the premise 
it will promote the creation 
of new jobs and stimulate 
the economy, furthering the 
development of fossil fuels 
is the wrong way to go about 

those goals. The DAPL will 
produce hundreds of temporary 
construction jobs, but will only 
offer a handful of jobs in the 
long run. If Trump truly cares 
about infrastructure and job 
growth, he will encourage 
renewables 
instead 
of the 

economically 
deteriorating 

and 
environmentally 

dangerous 
energy 
sources 

like the oil that would be 
transported by the DAPL.

Building the DAPL would not 

only be environmentally costly, 
but also continues to perpetuate 
the U.S. government’s historic 
and systematic mistreatment 
of 
Native 
Americans. 
The 

Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation 
states 
federal 

agencies must consult with 
Indian tribes if construction 
projects 
take 
place 
on 
or 

affect religiously or culturally 
significant land. Yet the Sioux 
assert that the Army Corps 
rushed the surveying process 
with the Nationwide Permit 
12 and didn’t make significant 

efforts to include the tribe’s 
input in construction plans. The 
pipeline’s path over significant 
tribal archaeological finds, and 
the threat it poses to the tribe’s 
water 
intake, 
demonstrate 

disregard for tribal sovereignty 
and echo the long history of 
questionable land grabs from 
native peoples in U.S. history. 
The Army Corps must cease 
authorization for the pipeline 
if it intends to reconcile with 
a people long abused by the 
federal government.

Moving the pipeline away 

from North Dakota’s capital 
of Bismarck and to its current 
path because of concerns over 
the city’s water supply further 
shows disregard for the Sioux 
nation. Though this was likely 
seen as a simply utilitarian 
decision, the shifted plans 
echo government disregard for 
people of color, which we’ve 
seen more locally in Flint, 
Mich. According to the Sioux, 
the reroute may violate the 
Clean Water Act and National 
Environmental 
Policy 
Act 

through the dangers it poses 
to the Sioux water intake. 
The government should shut 
down the DAPL and condemn 
environmental racism.

Recent 
clashes 
between 

protesters and law enforcement 
officials 
in 
Standing 

Rock 
further 
necessitate 

the 
cessation 
of 
DAPL 

construction. 
The 
Standing 

Rock Medic and Healer Council 
has condemned health dangers 
posed 
by 
police 
brutality, 

including police forces’ use 
of tear gas and water hoses in 
freezing 
temperatures, 
and 

has filed a lawsuit alleging 
excessive force. This violence 
stands in stark contrast to the 
non-violent 
police 
response 

during the occupation of the 
Malheur 
National 
Wildlife 

Refuge in Oregon by armed 
white men. The response to 
the DAPL protests contributes 
to the problem of excessive 
police 
aggression 
toward 

marginalized communities.

Stopping construction of 

the Dakota Access Pipeline is 
vital to the preservation our 
environment and to the well-
being of the Standing Rock 
Sioux. Student activism on 
this issue is more important 
than ever, especially in the 
face of inadequate coverage 
of the silencing of the protests. 
We call on the Army Corps of 
Engineers and Dakota Access 
LLC to cease construction of 
the project. For the safety of the 
local ecology and the dignity of 
the Sioux community, we ask 
for a halt to the construction of 
the DAPL.

My grandmother’s apartment 

in Tehran has a balcony overrun 
with various herbs and tomato 
plants. It runs across the back 
of the living room, a cozy white 
platform 
that 
overlooks 
the 

patchwork quilt of the rest 
of the city. I like to escape to 
it right at sunset, when my 
grandmother and mother are 
usually in the kitchen, cutting 
open pomegranates to eat as a 
snack before dinner. Their voices 
tumble around green bowls with 
seeds as red as the sun as it begins 
to sink beneath the line of the 
city.

From 
my 
vantage 
point 

thirteen stories up, the constant 
blanket of dust that floats above 
Tehran makes the entire city 
flicker like a golden mirage. It’s 
my favorite place in the world, 
this balcony right before dusk, 
when my toes curl around the 
edge of the terrace between the 
pillars of the railing as I crane my 
neck up and observe the world 
around me collectively hold its 
breath. We wait, for this: a call to 
prayer.

It comes in the form of music. 

Bare, haunting vocals released 
from local mosques into the 
open air flow between buildings 
and plead to the bruising sky, to 
the women hanging wet clothes 
from clotheslines, to the men 
selling fresh kabobs. It is both a 
reminder that the time for prayer 
is fast approaching and also an 
invitation for all to join.

Although I don’t consider 

myself to be a religious person, 
let alone a devout Muslim, 
whenever I have the chance 
to visit my grandmother, I am 
still inexplicitly drawn to the 
same spot on her balcony at the 
same time, day after day. There 
is a paradoxical intimacy in 
the recitation, in the way I feel 
connected to something I barely 
understand. It is the same feeling 
I get when I skim my fingers over 
the pristine pages of my father’s 
dense Qur’an like I’m skimming 
my fingers over a lake; I’m aware 
of the inky depths that disappear 
beneath the surface, I just have 
yet to find out what they hold.

When the music disappears 

with the sun, I slip back inside 

the apartment and pass my 
grandmother as she makes her 
way to her bedroom, to where 
I know her prayer rug is sitting 
at the foot of her bed. Her call 
is to prayer. I’m on the way 
to the kitchen. My call is to 
pomegranates, and the fruit, as it 
breaks open in my mouth, tastes 
like sweet familiarity. I suspect 
her prayer tastes like somewhat 
of the same thing.

I haven’t had a chance to visit 

my grandmother or her balcony 
in years, a fact that is a constant 
weight on my chest. I can’t 
imagine what it must be like 
for my parents, as immigrants 
in a foreign world. My mother 
holds tight to the music of her 
childhood, playing traditional 
songs as she sashays around 
the kitchen in the evenings. My 
father holds tight to a different 
kind of music: the rhythm of 
tradition. Every year, during the 
fasting month of Ramadan, my 
father breaks his fast two times a 
day. During both times, the sky’s 
pre-dawn or post-dusk blue black 
sky watches from the window: 
while my mother commanders 
the main course on the stove, 
he 
assembles 
bread, 
yogurt 

and cheese on the table and 
waits with one eye on the clock, 
counting down the seconds until 
he can eat.

During both times, he plays 

a prayer from his phone, and 
the dua as it comes through the 
tiny speakers fills our kitchen 
with peaceful reverence. The 
quiet words unfurl like flowers, 
revealing petals upon petals of 
history, with roots that slip down 
my father’s chair like ivy, turning 
into ley lines that connect him to 
the family he left behind.

My old friend’s house in 

Rochester Hills, Mich. has a 
balcony bereft of any decoration 
except for a few wooden chairs 
haphazardly scattered around. 
It runs along the entirety of the 
back of her house, a bleak wooden 
ledge that overlooks the rolling 
expanse of her lawn. It was here 
that I found myself sitting one 
day in the middle of the summer 
between middle school and high 
school with my friend sitting 
opposite, pressing a small bible 
into the palm of my hand. I took 
it with reluctance, because the 
edges were unfamiliar and bit 
into the creases of my fingers. She 

took out her own copy and held it 
easily, worn down edges molding 
perfectly to the cadence of her 
grip. It was here that I received 
my first lesson of Christianity, an 
idea born through the marriage 
of her constant desire to talk 
about the religion that meant 
so much to her family and my 
endless boredom of repetitious 
summer days.

I was sure that the day would 

be taken up by extensive lectures 
and readings, but instead she 
pulled out an iPod shuffle from 
her pocket, which, according 
to her, was filled with different 
Christian songs of worship. We 
spent the rest of the afternoon 
going through the entirety of her 
collection, and while many of the 
songs went over my head, glossy 
with a decadence I wasn’t used to 
hearing from religion, I focused 
instead on how my friend listened 
to those songs: eyes closed with 
her head tilted up towards the 
sky, like the sun and songs she 
knew by heart had come together 
to form a perfect harmony, a call 
to home. 

I am not a religious person. 

But I still have the Bible my 
friend gave to me all those years 
ago resting in a drawer. I like to 
take it out sometimes and rifle 
through the pages. It reminds me 
of the absolute joy she found in a 
chipped blue iPod Shuffle. 

I am not a religious person. But 

some days at sunset I like to lean 
my head against the glass of my 
apartment window as the familiar 
call to prayer echoes through my 
speakers into the empty corners 
of my room. It transforms into 
my grandmother’s balcony and 
instead of the city of Ann Arbor, 
I am looking at mountains that 
stretch up from the horizon 
like earthy heart lines. I still 
don’t understand why my feet 
constantly bring me to the same 
spot on the same balcony. I don’t 
understand, but maybe I don’t 
need to.

Maybe all I can do is quietly, 

simply, listen — to a friend as 
she sings the church hymns her 
mother taught her, to a father as 
he breaks his fast to a prayer he 
remembers his father reciting a 
thousand times in the past, to the 
music in religion because it can 
sometimes be the music of home, 
wherever that may be, whatever 
that might sound like.

TV REVIEW

Maybe 
you’ve 
sworn 
off 

dystopian 
thrillers. 
“That 

was 
so 
middle 

school,” you say. 
The genre had 
its 
renaissance, 

after 
all, 
and 

now you’ve put 
your Mockingjay 
pins to rest. But 
with a brilliant 
cinematographer, 
a fresh setting and a punchy 
eight-episode arc, Netflix’s new 
original series “3%” sucks you 
into the craze all over again. 
The streaming giant’s first all-
Brazilian production breathes 
new life and energy into the 
genre, perfect for the older, 
more intellectual you — and not 
just because you have to read 
subtitles.

In a futuristic society, the 

vast majority — the 97 percent 
— 
live 
a 
poverty-stricken 

existence. 
Each 
year, 
the 

population’s 20-year-olds have 
a chance to elevate their status 
by going through the Process, 
an 
elimination 
procedure 

characterized 
by 
mental, 

physical and emotional tests 
(think “The Hunger Games,” 
but less gory). Only three 
percent will be chosen to live 
out the rest of their lives on the 
Offshore, a mystical, utopian 
land of progress, safety and 

wealth.

The series opens on the 104th 

year of the Process, as 20-year-
old hopefuls make their way 
from their torn-down favelas 
to the cold, empty evaluation 

facility, which acts 
as 
the 
primary 

setting 
for 
the 

show’s first season. 
Sci-fi gadgets and 
gizmos set up the 
futuristic feel as 
the series paints 
a 
stark 
contrast 

between 
the 

progress achieved by the elite 
and the poverty endured by the 
rest of the society.

Despite “3%” ’s relatively low 

production 
costs, 
especially 

when 
compared 
to 
recent 

releases in the genre on Netflix 
(like 
“Black 
Mirror”), 
the 

minimalistic setting still works. 
Although 
visually 
bare, 
it’s 

always intriguing, as Oscar-
nominated 
cinematographer 

César Charlone (“City of God”) 
lends his genius to “3%.” The 
camera has impressive range, 
moving so uncomfortably close 
to a character that you can 
see every pore, or flying out 
to show an impressive view 
of the broken city below. The 
viewer’s experience is more 
than engaging: it’s exhilarating. 
As the audience tries to figure 
out the rules and constructions 
of the dystopia, the camera soars 
to make them want to live it 
themselves.

Perhaps what makes “3%” 

so captivating for a mature 
audience is the depth of its 
characters. 
The 
candidates 

the series focuses on are both 
collectively and independently 
compelling, 
establishing 

intriguing relationships as their 
own stories, motivations and 
secrets surface.

Primarily, the series tells 

the story of Michele, a strong, 
vengeful young woman played 
by 
Bianca 
Comparato 
(“In 

Treatment”). “3%” also features 
a 
captivating 
performance 

from João Miguel (“Cinema, 
Aspirins, and Vultures”) as 
the deceptive leader of the 
Process, who has a few secrets 
of his own. At times, like the 
dystopian-thriller 
genre 
in 

general, the show can venture 
into soap-opera territory — 
due to the life and death of it 
all, perhaps. But paired with 
well-developed and intriguing 
characters, the overly dramatic 
acting is not so much a turn-
off, but rather another step in 
establishing the intense and 
binge-worthy feel of the series.

Considering today’s extreme 

political and social climate, 
fantasizing about another world 
is not so crazy. So whether you’re 
seeking full-bodied escapism or 
just an hour-long distraction, 
the 
gorgeous 
Portuguese 

dialogue and the vision of a 
brilliant cinematographer begs 
“3%” to be your next break from 
reality.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

The first time I tried composing, 

I severely underestimated the 
difficulty of the task at hand. 
My fellow seventh graders and 
I had been tasked with creating 
personal melodies that were to be 
performed in front of the entirety 
of the middle school orchestra, 
and I jumped at the opportunity 
to display my self-proclaimed 
musicality and artistic prowess. 
I wanted to make something 
beautiful, some sort of never-
before-heard chord progression 
that would latch onto heart and 
soul, tracing shudders into the 
spines of all who heard it.

But 
no 
matter 
what 

combinations I tried, I couldn’t 
spin my sky-high expectations 
for my composition into reality. 
My beginnings fell flat, clattering 
to the ground in soft puffs of dust 
instead of blooming into sparkling 
life like I’d hoped they would. 
Notes that I’d never paid attention 
to before my musical tinkering 
took on ominous visages of their 
own, radiating a stubborn aversion 
to any sort of cooperative union 
despite my pleading. Everything 
I tested sounded awkward and 
out of place, as if I’d somehow 
managed to discover the musical 
representation of a gracelessly 
gangly calf.

Even more paralyzing was 

my acute fear of accidentally 
plagiarizing music that already 
existed. In the rare instances 
when I thought I had the start 
of 
something 
even 
remotely 

acceptable, it didn’t take long 
for me to realize that the reason 
the tune seemed familiar was 
because it was similar to a long 

forgotten television jingle or, in 
one instance, the theme song to 
“Mr. Bean’s Holiday.”

I don’t know how I settled 

on a final version to perform. I 
remember going back to my seat 
with my cello in tow, filled with 
an all-consuming dissatisfaction 
with my piece and what I once 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
natural 

musicality. When the grades came 
out, I was surprised to have gotten 
full marks on the assignment, but 
even that didn’t do much to dull 
the slight bitterness I still had at 
myself for being unable to meet 
my own standards.

I haven’t tried to compose in 

the years since, mainly because 
I’m more focused on writing for 
my artistic outlet now. However, I 
still encounter the same dilemma 
whenever I’m stuck with writer’s 
block. 
There’s 
nothing 
more 

frustrating 
than 
feeling 
like 

your creativity has been trapped 
behind a very thick, very tall and 
very concrete wall that exists for 
no reason at all.

For people like my parents, 

who appreciate my writing ability 
but are immediately dismissive 
of anyone who chooses to pursue 
a career in the humanities, 
writer’s block is laughable, even 
more evidence that there’s barely 
any distinction between those 
who study the art of the word 
for years and mere students. 
They 
don’t 
understand 
the 

indescribable, 
thriving 
nature 

of creating, because it has never 
played much of a role in their 
lives. The problem is made worse 
by the fact that creativity is not a 
definitive subject with specific 
rules and regulations; the concept 
of creativity itself heavily relies on 
its immeasurability.

I think of creativity like a rice 

paddy — the more rice you plant, 
the richer the soil gets. Being a part 
of an environment that actively 
encourages creativity not only 
has a positive effect on my mental 
state but also my productivity 
overall. Writing is a very personal 
activity that I take a lot of joy in, 
and it’s not only hurtful but also 
disheartening to have something 
extremely meaningful to me 
treated so indifferently.

The problems that I faced when 

I first started out with my seventh 
grade composition still pop up 
every now and then when I sit 
down to write. Sometimes I can’t 
get my sentences to flow the way I’d 
like to, and they’ll sound as wispy 
and formless as an unrosined bow 
over clean strings. Other times, 
I’m simply unable to convey the 
exact picture I’m trying to paint 
no matter how many phrasings 
I try. Worst of all is when I can’t 
even fit sentences together. I’ll sit 
in front of my laptop for hours at 
a time, feeling the exact same way 
I did six years ago when I was 
cramming random notes against 
each other, desperately hoping 
that the sharps and flats would 
assemble into some semblance of a 
satisfactory song.

However, if writing were easy, I 

probably wouldn’t enjoy it as much 
as I do. Part of the allure of writing 
is the uncertainty surrounding the 
end result; even when I have a clear 
idea in mind of what exactly I want 
to create, I have no way of knowing 
precisely what’s going to show 
up on the page. I’ve changed and 
grown in countless ways since that 
20-measure composition, and one 
of the most important things I’ve 
learned is that obstacles such as 
writer’s block never truly go away, 
even as you get older. The only 
thing you can do is keep on trying.

Thrilling Brazilian series breathes new life into old tropes

Looking back to 2014, the 

year brought us Vince Staples’s 
Hell Can Wait. In the years 
following, 2015 gifted Kendrick 
Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly and 
2016 brought, uh, 21 Savage’s 
Savage Mode? Yeah. And Kodak 
Black, D.R.A.M., Lil Yachty and 
the like. 

Socially conscious rap seemed 

to have peaked in 2015. Lamar 
warned us of political divide 
in the form of “DemoCrips and 
ReBloodicans,” 
Lupe 
Fiasco 

talked of “watching Gazans 
and 
Ashkenazis 
ride 
roller 

coasters” and Vince Staples 
questioned 
“Black 
sellin’ 

crack for the white man.” For 
a genre arguably founded and 
bolstered early on by the moral 
implications of its content, such 
lyricism marked the final stages 
of a healthy evolution.

That being said, objectively 

“good” rap doesn’t need to be 
socially conscious. Listening 
gratification certainly comes 
from a nuanced perspective on 
a type of American life foreign 
to the majority of the audience, 
but it’s possible and likely more 
plausible to derive pleasure 
from purely enjoyable music.

Important 
rap, 
however, 

does need to have substance, 
and 
substantialism 
hasn’t 

exactly 
defined 
this 
year’s 

releases. For instance, “Black 
Beatles,” Rae Sremmurd’s hit, 
has 
gained 
more 
notoriety 

for its accompaniment of the 
viral “Mannequin Challenge” 
than for its actual musicality. 
Not even a Gucci feature can 
save the rest of the track’s 
underwhelming flow. It now 
seems like singles earn their 
mainstream badge based on 
meme-ability.

Put into more collegiately 

relevant 
terms, 
everything 

popular, everything “playable” 
from this year, would make 
for an unbelievable pregame 
playlist. You know, not the 
type of stuff you listen to for 
fulfillment (or enlightenment 
for that matter) but the boiled-
down bangers, songs like Yo 
Gotti’s “Down in the DM” and 
Yachty’s “Minnesota.” Jump 
on a table, maybe throw some 
shit, do some funny dances. 
This mood necessitates a basic 
criterion: a vibey beat, an 
infectious hook and a chant to 
mouth along so as to not look 
stupid. 2016’s offerings pass 
that test, they just might not 
pass a more enduring one.

This may sound completely 

old, crotchety and pretentious. 
Hell, it pretty much is old, 
crotchety and pretentious. Not 
to mention, to function within a 
generalization, especially when 
it comes to music, is bad. It’s just 
that increasingly, “meaningful” 

music seems like an exception.

Indeed, rap as a whole seems 

comfortable 
on 
its 
current 

trajectory toward a singularly 
“bumpable” genre, and 2016 
helped solidify that. While 
the virtuous persevere — A 
Tribe Called Quest’s We Got It 
from Here... Thank You 4 Your 
Service, Vic Mensa’s There’s 
Alot Going On, Isaiah Rashad’s 
The Sun’s Tirade and even 
Schoolboy Q’s Blank Face LP, all 
releases from this year, expand 
upon 
Lamar-esque 
tensions 

— to an increasing extent, 
we’re listening for fun and not 
fulfillment.

To be sure, the visibility is 

what seems different. Last year, 
emotionally-charged anthems 
like “King Kunta” and “Alright” 
got airtime, whereas this year, 
nothing remotely related to the 
public affairs of this country 
has successfully crossed over 
into 
the 
mainstream. 
And 

it’s November. There’s a mix 
of 
guilt-free 
bangers 
and 

meaningful statements filling 
out the landscape of rap at this 
moment, but the imbalance in 
exposure is what defines its 
current climate.

Maybe that’s the point. Trap, 

drill, bounce, cloud, whatever 
— they’ve always coexisted. 
Variety gives the genre its most 
potent flavor. Ultimately, it’s 
our obligation to find our own 
happy medium.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The latest feature from Walt 

Disney Animation Studios was 
born out of the rich oral traditions 
of Oceania. For centuries, the 
people of Oceania were sailors and 
navigated the waters of the Pacific. 
But, for reasons unknown to 
historical scholars, their voyages 
stopped around the year 1000 B.C., 
and they stayed put for almost a 
millennium. “Moana” aims to, at 
least partially, answer the question 
of why these voyages stopped 
by following Moana, a teenage 
princess, as she sets sail beyond 
her island shore for the first time 
in hundreds of years.

Amy Smeed, the head animator 

for the film, came to the University 
of Michigan earlier this month 
to talk to Screen Arts & Cultures 
and Art & Design students about 
the creation of the film. Smeed 
oversaw the animation for many 
of the human characters, but was 
particularly fond of the heroine, 
Moana.

“She’s very courageous and 

fearless, and I love that about her,” 
Smeed said in an interview, “And 
she’s very athletic … The scenes 
that I got to animate, I picked 
Moana.”

Smeed said Auli’i Cravalho, the 

young actress who voices Moana, 
landed her the role alongside 
seasoned actors like Dwayne 
Johnson and Temuera Morrison 

because of her tenacity and 
spirit. Having her on set helped 
Smeed and her team of animators 
visualize Moana’s energy.

“As animators, when we’re out 

in the world, we’re constantly 
observing — watching movements 
and mannerisms of teenagers and 
what that energy is,” Smeed said.

Smeed began her career as a 

painter. She attended art school 
at Western Michigan University 
but transferred to School of the 
Art Institute of Chicago after 
she was sent a disc advertising 
their animation program. After 
discovering 
animation 
and 

finishing 
her 
studies, 
Smeed 

went on to become an animator 
at Disney, working on animation 
for projects from “Meet the 
Robinsons” 
to 
“Frozen.” 
For 

“Moana,” Smeed served as the 
head animator. 

“When I was living here in 

Michigan, I loved painting, and I 
wasn’t really sure what to do with 
it as an actual career,” Smeed said. 
“For me it was always trying to 
figure out, within art, what can 
I do with that? So when I found 
animation, I really do feel lucky.”

Even though Smeed doesn’t 

spend much of her time painting 
and drawing anymore, she stressed 
the importance for young artists 
and aspiring animators to keep 
pursuing art in a more traditional, 
pen-and-paper kind of way.

“I think sometimes there’s 

a misconception that now that 
everything is in the computers, 

you just do it in the computer,” she 
said, “But there’s so much drawing 
that actually takes place, even in a 
computer animation film. “

Smeed has found tremendous 

success working at Disney, but 
noted that animation, like many 
other fields, can be a little bit of a 
boy’s club.

“I don’t know why that is. I’m 

trying to figure that out, and that’s 
one of the reasons I love coming 
to talk to students, because I’m 
hoping that it will inspire other 
women … to know they can do this 
career,” she said. “When I was in 
art school, there weren’t many 
women in our classes, so it made 
sense to me. But now there are. I 
see a lot of women in the classes.”

The content of the studio’s 

most recent films, she said, 
reflects the increased, albeit still 
slight, role of female leadership 
and involvement. Storylines are 
moving away from traditional love 
stories and are focusing instead on 
strong, independent female leads. 
That trend continues in “Moana.” 
Moana and Maui traverse the 
ocean and fight magical creatures 
without the slightest hint of 
romance. 

“It’s great to see the two of them 

together and how they interact 
with each other. But I love that … 
she’s not in love with him, he’s not 
in love with her,” Smeed said.

“Moana” hit theaters right 

in time to relieve Thanksgiving 
tables of tension and political 
debate.

‘Moana’ animator talks 
film, female leadership

FILM INTERVIEW

Anywhere that you tell me 

to. Through Rory dropping out 
of Yale and the big fight with 
Lorelai. Through the season 
four finale. Through the Luke 
and 
Lorelai 
will-they-won’t-

they mess. Through any episode 
with April. Through the last 
ten, Gilmore-less, years. And 
now, all the way to Netflix. This 
Thanksgiving between turkey 
and debates over deflategate 
(yep, mine is still having those) 
I found time to watch — and 
rewatch — the “Gilmore Girls” 
revival.

I was excited, and a little 

terrified, to watch the show 
when it dropped on Netflix last 
Friday. I’m a fan. But I’m one 
of those second wave fans that 
found Gilmore Girls after the 
show stopped airing on TV. 
Even before the days of Netflix, 
I had the box-set of Gilmore 
Girls DVDs and watched and 
rewatched them a hundred 
times. I was scared that the 
revival would fall into “Fuller 
House” territory, that it would 
feel false and gimmicky. But it 

wasn’t. It was flawed, but it was 
pretty wonderful.

Part of that comes from the 

fact that creators Amy Sherman-
Palladino and her husband Dan 
knew exactly the audience they 
were writing for. They were 
writing for their fan base. They 
were writing for people who 
were going to watch the revival 
no matter what.

The queen of the revival 

was Emily, which is surprising 
given the show’s primary focus 
on the relationship between 
Rory and Lorelai. But here, it’s 
Emily who undergoes the most 
interesting character change. 
Lorelai is pretty much the same 
(Lauren Graham has not aged a 
day; it’s remarkable), Rory is a 
mess, but I’ll get into that later. 
When the revival begins, Emily 
is floundering after the death 
of her husband, Richard. She 
sells all her belongings, tries 
going to therapy, fights with 
her daughter and ultimately 
decides to move to Nantucket 
and start fresh. She takes on an 
unexpected role as the voice of 
reason across the four episodes 
and demonstrates the most 
strength and resilience.

The oddest part of the revival 

is how little it lets its women 
grow. The original series was 
full of strong young women with 
ambition and passion — women, 
like Rory or Paris and to a lesser 
extent Laine, who were smart 
and set on cutting their way to 
the top of a world that valued 
their male classmates above 
them. But now, in the revival, 
all three women — especially 
Rory and Paris — seem less 
mature and more aimless than 
ever. Rory is adrift, riding on 
a trust fund and a couple New 
Yorker bylines. She gives off 
the illusion of drive with her 
“business” trips to London, but 
even those seem more focused 
on seeing Logan than advancing 
her career. Paris has set up a 
multimillion-dollar 
company 

but melts at the sight of her 
high 
school 
crush, 
Tristan 

(who isn’t even played by Chad 
Michael 
Murray 
anymore!). 

It’s 
disappointing, 
although 

not wholly surprising, that the 
show prioritized an avenue to a 
neat Stars Hollow reunion over 
the success and passion of its 
female leads.

I’ve 
been 
waiting 
so 

impatiently for those last four 
words. I thought that maybe 
they were going to be the key 
to redemption and progress for 
our stunted heroine. Besides 
“the zombies are here,” there 
wasn’t much that I’d ruled 
out, so I can’t say I was totally 
surprised by the four that were 
chosen. I did have to rewind the 
last minute a few times to make 

sure I heard it right.

Rory’s pregnant — that makes 

sense, it keeps with the trend 
of 
coming 
full-circle 
that’s 

especially 
apparent 
in 
the 

“Fall” installment. Lorelai has 
to make a bargain with Emily 
in exchange for a loan, Rory 
is writing a story — probably 
the story we just spent seven 
years and six hours watching. 
Everything seems to be ending 
where it began. Rory, now 32, 
is now the same age Lorelai 
was when the series began. It’s 
spooky how well all the timing 
worked out.

It seems pretty clear to me 

now 
that 
the 
Rory/Lorelai 

parallels go further than that. 
Logan seems to be the most 
obvious contender for the baby’s 
father. He takes on the role of 
Christopher — wealthy, absent 
but well intentioned — while the 
path has been cleared for Jess to 
step into the role of Luke. The 
look he gives Rory through the 
window late in the final episode 
confirms what viewers have 
been suspecting and hoping for 
— he’s still in love with Rory.

But is Rory ready for a guy 

like Jess? As of the end of the 
original series, I would say no. 
And at the end of the revival 
I would still say no. While 
Jess has matured into a mildly 
successful 
writer/publisher, 

Rory is still directionless. She’s 
emotionally stunted — making 
many of the same mistakes she 
made at 22, the last time we 
saw her. Even at 32, Rory has 
a lot of growing up to do. She 
still uses Logan — despite his 
engagement to someone named 
Odette — as a crutch, leaning on 
him for emotional fulfillment 
and companionship. Two things 
he can’t give her.

I’ll admit, I’m biased. I’ve 

been stubbornly team Jess since 
he came into our lives back in 
season two. I still hold out that 
the Rory/Jess kiss at Sookie’s 
wedding is one of the best 
kisses in TV history. The dance 
marathon episode is the best 
episode because Rory finally 
realizes Jess is a million times 
better than Dean, who is actually 
the worst character ever.

So now I’m conflicted. More 

episodes 
seem 
well 
within 

the realm of possibility; I just 
don’t know if I want them. No 
matter how much she annoys 
me, I would love nothing more 
than to see Rory healthy, happy 
and successful. But sometimes 
— especially in the world of 
sequels — less really is more. 
I can only hope that “Gilmore 
Girls” takes notes from TV 
shows that tanked in quality in 
their final seasons (“The Office” 
is a great example) and learns 
when to quit.

What to watch this weekend

When 
the 
then-No. 
3 

Michigan football team lost to 
No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday 
in double overtime, its chances 
of making it to the College 
Football Playoff plummeted, 
but they weren’t completely put 
to rest.

The Wolverines no longer 

control their own destiny, but 
given that the CFP committee 
placed Michigan at No. 5 on 
Tuesday night, there’s still a 
chance the Wolverines will 
crawl into the top four after this 
weekend’s conference games.

With victories over No. 6 

Wisconsin, No. 7 Penn State and 
No. 8 Colorado, Michigan has 
a rooting interest in multiple 
games this weekend. Don’t be 
surprised when players and fans 
cheer extra hard for Colorado 
and Virginia Tech on Saturday.

Assuming the winner of the 

Big 12 Championship won’t 
affect the CFP committee’s 
top four (No. 9 Oklahoma 
and No. 10 Oklahoma State 
look to be just out of reach), 
here’s a breakdown of how 
the conference championship 
games 
could 
affect 
the 

Wolverines’ ranking.

Big Ten Championship: No. 

6 Wisconsin (7-2 Big Ten, 10-2 
overall) vs. No. 7 Penn State 
(7-2, 10-2), 8 p.m. Saturday

This game is less clear-cut 

for Michigan fans. Because the 
Wolverines walloped Penn State 
49-10 back in September and 
cut it close against Wisconsin 
the next week, winning 14-7, 
common intuition would lead 
Michigan fans to believe that a 
Nittany Lions win would hold 
both the Badgers and Penn 
State out of the CFP.

If you take a closer look at 

their records, though, it’s not 
too hard to make the case that 

the Nittany Lions have a better 
resume. They toppled Ohio 
State in overtime, 24-21, giving 
the Buckeyes their only loss of 
the season.

Wisconsin did lose to both 

Michigan and Ohio State, but 
held it close in both games and 
took the Buckeyes to overtime 
as well. Given the Badgers’ 
impressive schedule and tight 
losses, it seems that they’re 
more likely to make it to the 
CFP with a victory. If that’s the 
case, then a Penn State victory 
might give the Wolverines the 
push they need for a playoff 
berth if Washington or Clemson 
loses control.

ACC 
Championship: 
No. 

3 Clemson (11-1) vs. No. 23 
Virginia Tech (9-3), 8 p.m. 
Saturday

The 
Tigers 
have 
looked 

convincing all season, but their 
strength of schedule has also 
been called into question. They 
have wins over No. 12 Florida 
State and No. 13 Louisville 
— which lost last week to 
unranked Kentucky — but also 
had questionable performances 
in some of their victories. N.C. 
State (6-6) battled Clemson in 
overtime, only to fall short, 24-17.

Clemson’s only loss was on 

Nov. 12 after Pittsburgh scored 
nine unanswered points in the 
fourth quarter to win, 43-42.

Despite the worries about 

the Tigers, they still finished 
the regular season 11-1. Virginia 
Tech will have to play its best 
game of the year if it wants to 
beat Clemson, and with losses 
to Tennessee, Syracuse and 
Georgia Tech, it seems unlikely 
that the Hokies will upset the 
Tigers.

If 
Clemson 
fell, 
then 

Michigan would most likely 
compete for its spot with the 
Big Ten Champion.

Pac-12 Championship: No. 

4 Washington (11-1) vs. No. 8 

Colorado (10-2), 9 p.m. Friday

The Wolverines are quite 

familiar with Colorado. The 
Buffaloes 
startled 
Michigan 

in September when they came 
out firing on all cylinders. 
After the first 15 minutes of 
play, Colorado was up, 21-7. The 
Wolverines calmed down and 
gained control in the second 
quarter to go into halftime with 
a 24-21 lead.

Michigan found its groove 

moving 
forward 
and 
won 

convincingly by 17 points, but 
for a few minutes, the Wolverine 
faithful were shaking in their 
boots. Colorado quarterback 
Sefo Liufau was impressive, 
throwing 16-for-25 for 246 
yards and three touchdowns 
before leaving the game in the 

third quarter due to injury.

The Buffaloes suffered their 

only other loss on the road at 
Southern 
California, 
where 

they fell, 21-17.

Washington 
will 
be 

challenged more by Colorado 
than it has been in a while. The 
Huskies also fell to USC, losing 
26-13 after going scoreless in 
the fourth quarter.

The 
Trojans 
were 
the 

strongest 
team 
Washington 

faced this season. Utah (8-4) 
was arguably second-best, and 
the Huskies won, 31-24.

It’s hard to predict what 

will happen in this game, but if 
Colorado wins, it will probably 
knock Washington out of the 
playoffs and give Michigan an 
added boost.

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan falls to Penn 
State in Big Ten opener

STATE COLLEGE — Last 

season, the Michigan hockey 
team accrued a 5-0 record 
against 
Penn 
State, 
outscoring 
the Nittany Lions by 26 goals. 
In the first meeting between 
the teams this season, that was 
not the case.

After allowing one goal in 

the first period off a scramble in 
front of the net, the Wolverines 
(0-1-0 Big Ten, 6-6-1 overall) 
entered 
the 
second 
period 

trailing. 
And 
with 
15:18 

remaining in the second half, 
the Michigan defense showed 
another sign of weakness.

Sophomore 
defenseman 

Nicholas Boka chased down 
a puck in the defensive zone 
and tried to send a no-look 
pass to a teammate, but was 
intercepted 
by 
Penn 
State 

forward Liam Folkes. Folkes 
then took the puck across the 
crease unimpeded and fired a 
backhanded goal past senior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort.

From there, the Nittany Lions 

(1-0-0, 12-1-1) and their nation-
leading offense took over. Penn 
State outshot Michigan, 48-29, 
en route to a 6-1 victory.

“It starts in the offensive zone,” 

said senior defenseman Nolan De 
Jong. “We can’t let them build 
off that speed. We know they’re 
going to be a fast, hard team, so 
we’ve got to be able to forecheck, 
be able to pinch down and kind of 
slow those guys up. That starts 
with fore and backchecking, 
it starts with (defense) having 
better gaps.”

Though Nagelvoort did give 

up four goals before being 
replaced in net by freshman 

Jack LaFontaine, the senior 
was put in tough positions 
throughout the game.

With 1:38 remaining in the 

second period, the Nittany 
Lions cleared a puck all the 
way down the ice for what was 
almost an icing penalty. But 
junior defenseman Sam Piazza 
was unable to get to the puck 
first, as Penn State forward 
Zach Saar maneuvered around 
the Wolverine blueliner and 
fired a pass to forward Ricky 
DeRosa, who buried a one-
timer past Nagelvoort.

“I didn’t think our team had 

a good game in front of our 
goalie,” said Michigan coach 
Red 
Berenson. 
“I 
thought 

Zach Nagelvoort kept us in 
the game. But they got behind 
us, they got through us, our 
forwards weren’t picking up 
men. I mean, give Penn State 
credit. They won all the races, 
and they won all the battles and 
they got all the goals.”

The 
lone 
Michigan 
goal 

came 
from 
junior 
forward 

Tony 
Calderone, 
who 
has 

scored three goals in the last 
three games. But by the time 
that tally came, the game was 
already out of reach, with the 
score 5-1.

Beyond that, the Wolverines 

found it hard to get many good 
chances against Penn State 
goaltender Peyton Jones.

They will take on the Nittany 

Lions again Friday night, looking 
for the answer to Penn State’s 
speed and physicality that they 
couldn’t find on Thursday.

“We have to be a better team 

tomorrow 
night,” 
Berenson 

said. “Now they’re a good 
team — they’re one of the best 
teams in the country right now 
— and we didn’t measure up 
tonight. We’ve got to be better 
tomorrow. Simple as that.”

Wolverines blow out 
Georgia Tech on road

Entering Thursday night, the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team was ranked 27th in the 
coaches’ 
poll 
and 

33rd in the 
Associated 
Press 
poll. 
Georgia 
Tech’s 

respective rankings were 29th 
and 31st.

While those placements would 

suggest a close contest between 
the two teams in Atlanta on 
Thursday night, the Wolverines 
had 
very 
different 
plans. 

Michigan (7-1) rode multiple 
double-digit scoring runs en 
route to a 92-52 victory against 
the Yellow Jackets (6-1). Junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty led the 
Wolverines with 25 points while 
junior forward Jillian Dunston 
nabbed a double-double with 10 
points and 12 rebounds,

“Definitely didn’t expect it,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico regarding the blowout. “We 
came out of the gate and jumped 
on them right away. We never 
really looked back. We kicked 
their butt and I didn’t think we 
were going to do that coming into 
someone’s home court, especially 
a team that was 6-0 and had some 
real quality wins.”

Michigan dominated from 

the start, scoring the first nine 
points. Sophomore center Hallie 
Thome accounted for four of the 
Wolverines’ early points with 
her two layups, while senior 
guard 
Siera 
Thompson 
and 

Flaherty accounted for three 
and two, respectively.

“I thought Hallie was great,” 

Barnes Arico said. “She made 
their defense really difficult 
because she ran so well. When 
our guards are shooting that 
well, they were trying to pick, 
‘Ok, who am I going to match up 
with?’ and Hallie was able to get 
some easy buckets.”

Georgia Tech showed much 

more fight in the remainder of the 
quarter, scoring five consecutive 

points at the end of the period to 
trim its deficit to 23-16. It seemed 
like 
the 
expected 
dogfight 

between the Wolverines and the 
Yellow Jackets was on.

But Michigan quickly put any 

illusions of a close game to rest in 
the second quarter.

Nursing a 27-20 lead with 

7:25 left until halftime, the 
Wolverines put together a 12-0 
run, during which freshman 
guard Kysre Gonderezick put 
up seven points. Gonderezick 
finished the game with 15 points, 
and Michigan took a 45-28 
advantage into the intermission.

The gap between the two teams 

only grew in the second half.

Already holding a 47-31 lead 

with 7:54 remaining in the 
third quarter, the Wolverines 
went on a scorching 19-0 run to 
put the contest far out of reach 
for 
Georgia 
Tech. 
Flaherty 

accounted for nine of Michigan’s 
19 points in that stretch.

“Just getting to the rim was 

important,” Flaherty said. “My 
outside shot wasn’t really falling 
tonight. But I hit all of my foul 
shots, which was big. That was 
a big confidence booster for me.”

With Thursday night’s win, 

the Wolverines now have two 
victories over opponents who 
have received votes in the 
coaches’ poll — they defeated 
then-No. 25 Gonzaga, 78-66, on 
Nov. 24. These victories might be 
enough to propel Michigan into 
the top 25 on Monday.

But the Wolverines will have 

to not let potential rankings go 
to their heads, especially with 
three more road games before 
their next matchup at Crisler 
Center. They were in a similar 
position last year, but a 74-57 loss 
at Princeton on Dec. 6 prevented 
them from cracking the top 25.

“I think we can play with any 

team,” Flaherty said. “Tonight, 
coming in and beating a 6-0 
team what has some pretty good 
wins by 40 points should make a 
statement. But we need to keep 
a level head, stay humble and 
continue to work hard.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan looks to bounce back again

Over the course of a college 

basketball season, the schedule 
typically doesn’t let up between 
games 
for 

teams 
to 

recover from a 
poor outing or 
a disappointing 
finish.

But 
after 

a 
dismal 

performance 
last Wednesday 
night at South 
Carolina 
resulted in its 
first loss of the 
season, 
the 

Michigan men’s 
basketball team 
had two days 
off before returning to action at 
Crisler Center against Mount St. 
Mary’s. While the Gamecocks 
were a relatively even match 
for the Wolverines — both had 
4-0 records at the time — the 
Mountaineers had won only once 
in six tries and looked likely to be 
no match for Michigan.

And that proved to be the case, 

as the Wolverines bounced back 
from a humiliating 15-point loss 
behind an offensive resurgence 
that saw them shoot 43.6 percent 
from the floor and 11-for-27 from 
beyond the arc to earn a 17-point 
win.

The stage has been set for 

a parallel situation to occur 
Saturday when Michigan (5-2) 
takes on Kennesaw State (3-5).

Wednesday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines suffered a stunning 
73-70 defeat at the hands of 
Virginia Tech in the ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge. Though they 
spent much of the game in cruise 
control, leading for all but 2:18 of 
regulation, the Hokies gradually 
inched 
their 
way 
back 
as 

Michigan’s shooters went cold. 

The Wolverines had their 

largest lead of the contest — a 
15-point 
margin 
— 
halfway 

through 
the 
first 
half, 
but 

Virginia Tech whittled it down 

to nine at the break. Within the 
first five minutes of the second 
half, the Hokies had tightened 
it all the way to one. But after 
Michigan pushed it back out to 10 
with seven minutes left to play, 
Virginia Tech went on a 16-5 
run in the next five minutes to 
take a one-point lead it wouldn’t 
relinquish.

With 
5-1 

records, 
the 

Wolverines 
and 
Hokies 

were also fairly 
even 
in 
their 

matchup, 
but 

after two days 
off again, that 
won’t be the case 
when Michigan 
faces the Owls. 
Kennesaw State will travel to 
Ann Arbor coming off a road 
trip in Florida, where it secured 
a two-point victory over Florida 
A&M for its first road win of 
the season after falling on the 
wrong end of another two-point 
encounter against South Florida.

The Owls may be riding 

some momentum, but it likely 
won’t be enough for them to 
overtake the Wolverines. That 
is, if Michigan can repeat the 
type of performance it put on to 
right the ship against an inferior 
opponent in Mount St. Mary’s 
last Saturday.

On the offensive side of 

the 
ball, 
the 

Wolverines 
are 

in good shape to 
replicate 
their 

dominance. They 
posted 70 points 
on 
Virginia 

Tech, 
a 
major 

improvement 
from 
their 

46-point output 
against 
South 

Carolina. 
But 

after giving up a season-high 
73 points, the defense is in a 
different state of affairs. 

“The biggest thing to take 

away from this is we gotta be able 
to finish on the defensive end, 
not really on offense,” said senior 
forward Zak Irvin after the loss 
to the Hokies. “Defense wins 

games, and we didn’t do that and 
we lost.”

Against a Kennesaw State 

team that is averaging 75.8 
points per game on 45.7 percent 
shooting from the floor and 37 
percent from beyond the arc, 
the defense will now need to be 
the unit that steps up to help the 
Wolverines bounce back from 
another tough loss.

Michigan 
closed 
out 
the 

victory over Mount St. Mary’s on 
an 11-2 run, while the opposite 
occurred in the loss to Virginia 
Tech. 

“Most importantly, we gotta 

be able to finish. We didn’t finish 
tonight,” Irvin said. “This one’s 
gonna haunt us. Obviously, we 
gotta learn from it tomorrow, 
we gotta put it in the back of our 
head, but this is definitely one 
that’s gonna take a little bit to 
sink in.”

The Wolverines have been 

fortunate to be able to rebound 
against easier opposition after 
their two losses this season, but 
when Big Ten play rolls around, 
they won’t be so lucky.

‘M’ wins opener: ‘Five more rounds’

It started with a block on the 

left side, followed by another 
on the right. When American 
gathered 
for a third 
attempt, 
the 
Wolverines swatted that one, 
too, this time into the floor to 
take a commanding 12-5 first-
set lead. The towering front line 
of sophomore Claire Kieffer-
Wright, 
sophomore 
Carly 

Skjodt and freshman MacKenzi 
Welsh rejoiced along with the 
hometown Crisler Center crowd. 

It was that kind of night for 

the Wolverines, who made quick 
work of the Eagles in their 3-0 
victory in the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament.

Nearly three months ago, the 

Michigan volleyball team (11-9 
Big Ten, 23-10 overall) defeated 
American (15-1 Patriot League, 
27-7 overall) in the Panther 
Invitational, 
3-0. 
Thursday 

night, the Wolverines picked up 
right where they left off. No. 12 
Michigan came out in its NCAA 
Tournament debut with a 25-13 
first-set 
victory 
behind 
the 

strong play of Kieffer-Wright 
and senior outside hitter Kelly 
Murphy, who each tallied five 
kills in the set.

“It’s always hard in that first 

match of the NCAA Tournament 
to see how the nerves are going 
to be for the team, how we’re 
going to get into a rhythm,” 
said Michigan head coach Mark 
Rosen. “And I thought we did 
that really well.”

In the second set, though, 

the Patriot League champions 
fought back. 

Trailing 17-14 and later 20-17 

in the second set, Rosen was 
forced to call timeouts to get his 
team refocused.

“I don’t think in timeouts 

it’s about what we say, it’s more 
giving them a break, them talking 
with each other 
and just calming 
down,” 
Rosen 

said. 
“I 
think 

they responded 
really 
well 
to 

the change in 
momentum 
(at 

20-17).”

From 
there, 

the Wolverines 
came 
back 
to 

win the second 
set, 25-23, and cruised to a third-
set victory, 25-12, completing a 
win full of power and efficiency. 

Michigan finished with 51 total 

kills, only one shy of its season-
high in a three-set match. The 
attack was multi-dimensional, 
with three different Wolverines in 

double-digit kills — senior middle 
blocker Abby Cole (10), Murphy 
(10) and Kieffer-Wright (13).

Going 
forward, 
Michigan 

will face Oregon on Friday night 
at Crisler Center again, with a 
potential showdown with fifth-
seeded Kansas looming afterward.

“We’ll spend a lot of time in 

the next 24 hours preparing for 
(Oregon),” Rosen said. “They’re 
fast, they move around a lot. 
They’re very elusive in the way 
they come at you, and they’re 
athletic.”

But Rosen and his team don’t 

seem to be intimidated by any 
opponent going forward. They 
believe playing in the Big Ten 
— the conference with each 
of the top three seeds in the 
tournament and six of the top 16 
— has been the ultimate primer. 

“I think playing in the Big Ten 

is the best way to prepare for the 
tournament,” 
Kieffer-Wright 

said. “I really think that the 

teams in the Big 
Ten are the best 
you’re going to 
see all year.”

It 
was 
a 

routine 
win 

that took a bit 
of resiliency for 
Michigan. 
But 

after the game, 
Rosen and his 
team clearly had 
their sights set 

on bigger things.

In case there was any doubt, 

the 
Wolverines 
harbor 
the 

ultimate goal.

“National 
champions,” 

Kieffer-Wright said.

Added Rosen: “Five more 

rounds.”

In its first home NCAA 

Tournament match since 2009, 
the Michigan volleyball team 
put its offensive balance on full 
display.

Fifth-year 
senior 
outside 

hitter Kelly Murphy or junior 
outside 
hitter 
Carly 
Skjodt 

would rise up from the left side 
of the court to power a shot 
past American’s front line. Or 
senior middle blocker Abby 
Cole or junior middle blocker 
Claire Kieffer-Wright would 
elevate and thunder a kill 
down the middle. Anything the 
12th-ranked Wolverines tried 
offensively 
worked 
against 

the overmatched Eagles on 
Thursday night.

The first time these two 

teams met — in September at 
the Panther Invitational in 
Pittsburgh — Michigan swept 
American, 3-0, recording its 
most kills of the season for 
a three-set match with 52. 
They nearly equaled that total 
Thursday night, registering 51 
kills to the tune of a .406 kill 
percentage.

“That’s 
a 
lot 
of 
earned 

points,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “You’re going to 
get a certain number of points 
from your opponent making 
mistakes or from errors, or 
you’re going to get points from 
blocking or serving aces. But 51 
kills in a three-set match is a 
big number. That just tells me 
how smooth we’re playing on 

offense.”

It was that way from the 

beginning of the game. Cole, 
a 
unanimous 
All-Big 
Ten 

selection and the Wolverines’ 
leader in kills per set at 3.16, 
didn’t add to the kill total until 
the Wolverines were up 20-8 in 
the opening set. Instead, it was 
Murphy, Kieffer-Wright and 
Skjodt who carried most of the 
responsibility on offense. But 
a player of Cole’s caliber was 
never going to stay silent for 
long.

“She was playing fine, we 

just didn’t set her much,” 
Rosen said. “Had we set her, 
she’d have been fine. We were 
creating some other stuff that 
then opened her up for later.”

It was clear that the third set 

was Cole’s turn to dominate, 
and she did just that. She opened 
the set with a kill and tallied 
another four points in close 
succession midway through the 
set to help the Wolverines pull 
away for good.

Overall, Michigan saw three 

players 
with 
double-figure 

kills – Cole, Kieffer-Wright 
and Murphy with 13, 10 and 
10, respectively, with Skjodt 
chipping in with eight of her 
own. All told, it was one of their 
most well-rounded attacking 
efforts of the season.

“We did a great job with 

rhythm and tempo,” Murphy 
said. “All the hitters did a great 
job tonight.”

While American came in 

with just two players averaging 
at least two kills per set, five 

such players — Cole, Kieffer-
Wright, junior outside hitter 
Adeja Lambert, Murphy and 
Skjodt — can be found on 
Michigan’s roster. The contrast 
between the two teams in this 
regard was evident Thursday 
night in Crisler Center. When 
the 
Wolverines 
managed 

to limit the production of 
sophomore Aleksandra Kazala, 

who came in averaging 4.37 
kills per set, the Eagles didn’t 
have anywhere else to turn. 

Judging by Thursday night’s 

performance, as well as the 
entire season, the multitude of 
attacking options appears to be 
one of the Wolverines’ greatest 
strengths, and they hope that it 
can lead them on a special run 
through the tournament.
