A survey conducted by The 

Michigan Daily last month found 
74 percent of student respondents 
at the University of Michigan 
think tuition is too high, and 54 
percent believe the University 
doesn’t 
give 
out 
enough 

scholarship money.

LSA junior Kim Truong, a 

second-generation immigrant and 
first-generation college student, 
said despite receiving a full need-
based scholarship, she believes 
tuition at the University is too 
high.

“From my perspective, I think 

it’s very high-priced,” Truong said. 
“Although, I have the privilege of 
a full-ride scholarship — a need-
based scholarship — which covers 
my tuition and housing, (without 
it) I definitely wouldn’t have been 
able to bear the costs at all. I think 

(the 
University) 
should 
start 

looking at structural changes to 
their policies. They’re doing well 
in the grand scheme of things, but 
they should try to fix these issues.”

Rising Tuition
Last June, the Board of Regents 

approved a 3.9-percent tuition 
increase for in-state students and 
a 4.4-percent increase for out-of-
state students for the fiscal year 
of 2017. This translates to in-state 
students paying $546 more per 
year and out-of-state students to 
paying $1,934 more per year.

At that time, several regents 

opposed the tuition increase, as 
they believed it failed to address 
the overarching issue of rising 
higher-education costs. One vocal 
critic at the time was Regent 
Andrea Fischer Newman (R), who 
said the increase in financial aid 
did not offset the overall rising 
cost of higher education.

“Whether it comes from the 

University of Michigan’s general 

fund or from the government, 
more financial aid does not solve 
the underlying problem of rising 
college costs,” she said. “It only 
makes the University of Michigan 
less affordable, especially for 
middle-class students and their 
families, who are least likely to 
qualify for financial aid.”

Pamela 
Fowler, 
executive 

director of the Office of Financial 
Aid, said there is a proportionate 
amount of aid given to students, 
but recognized it does not cover 
the cost of books, housing and 
other expenses.

“In the 20 years I have been 

here, for every chance there was 
an increase in tuition students 
on financial aid got an increase 
in their need-based grant equal 

to the increase in tuition,” Fowler 
said. “So they were held harmless 
on the tuition increase. Now that 
doesn’t mean they were held 
harmless on everything else — 
you have to pay for books, housing 
and you have other expenses.”

Last school year, the University 

also gave out the most financial 
aid in the state of Michigan, 
totaling 
$907,915,059 
for 
the 

2015-16 school year, according 
to the Office of Financial Aid all-
aid chart Fowler provided. More 
specifically, $32,033,083 of it 
was need-based, $20,173,919 was 
merit-based and $15,691,139 was 
loans.

“We give out more financial 

aid than anybody in the state, 
probably more than anybody in 

the Midwest,” Fowler said. “But I 
can’t make it free for everybody.”

Truong, who is also on the 

executive board of the First 
Generation 
College 
Student 

Group, noted tuition could be 
cheaper if students were not 
required to pay for services not 
all use, like intramural building 
renovations, which cost students 
$130 a year.

“Little things like that add up,” 

Truong said. “It’s the difference 
between 
having 
the 
service 

available for you, and you not 
going to it because you don’t want 
to pay for it.”

Fowler said despite increasing 

what students have to pay, many 
of the smaller costs are necessary 
for giving students the services 

and resources they want.

“This is what students want,” 

Fowler said. “And now somebody 
who couldn’t pay for tuition in the 
first place now has to pay an extra 
$130 because this is what students 
want. So you have to think about 
these things. When you expect 
more and demand more, someone 
has to pay for it.”

Sociology Prof. Dwight Lang, 

who 
also 
advises 
the 
First 

Generation 
Student 
Group, 

doesn’t expect tuition to go down 
in the future without a resurgence 
in the economy and higher taxes to 
support education. 

More than 100 people marched 

Wednesday afternoon through 
downtown Ann Arbor as part of 
the International Women’s Strike, 
one of many demonstrations 
occurring throughout the day 
locally and nationwide. The strike 
encouraged women to take the 
day off from work and buy only 
from female- or minority-owned 
businesses.

Though similar in nature, the 

International 
Women’s 
Strike 

is not affiliated with the “A Day 
Without a Woman” event, which 
was organized by the Women’s 
March on Washington.

Liz Ratzloff, an organizer of 

the strike in Ann Arbor, spoke 
about the need for sustained 
activism, stating the current 
political moment was an ideal 
time to create new activists.

“The Women’s March was a 

pretty incredible event,” she said. 
“Millions of people marched 
around the country and around 
the world, so this has been a great 
opportunity to have sustained 
involvement and to not just have 
that be a one-time event. There 
are a ton of people who are getting 
involved, who haven’t ever been 
involved in activism or felt a strong 
need to resist in the past, and this 
is just another opportunity for 
that.”

Though the Women’s March, 

an activist group that grew out of 
the worldwide marches protesting 
President Trump’s inauguration, 

received 
flak 
for 
being 

exclusionary of trans women, the 
International 
Women’s 
Strike 

explicitly included trans women 
in its platform.

Ratzloff lauded the inclusion 

of the International Women’s 
Strike, emphasizing it was just 
as important to advocate on 
issues that she wasn’t personally 
affected by.

“First of all, trans women 

are women,” she said. “And 
trans women also experience 
an increased rate of violence 
and discrimination, and part of 
solidarity is standing up for issues 
that affect all of us. Injustice 
somewhere 
is 
an 
injustice 

everywhere.”

LSA junior Lakyrra Magee said 

every movement struggles with 
inclusion, and she criticized the 
signs and attire of some protesters 

in attendance.

“When I was first invited 

to speak at this event, I was 
hesitant,” Magee said. “As a queer 
Black woman, it is easy to end up 
being the diversity ticket for white 
activism. While we see an attempt 
with inclusivity in the platform, 
popular slogans and rhetoric 
express the severe need for better 
understanding of how we fight for 
all women. Your pussy hats are 
not inclusive to all women.”

Rackham 
student 
Rachel 

Miller, a member of the Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization, 

spoke 
about 
the 
importance 

of 
unionization, 
specifically 

referencing 
the 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan and the fact that all of the 
work necessary for the plan’s 
success is voluntary. GEO is 

currently 
bargaining 
a 
new 

contract with the University.

“One of the key components 

of our platform, something our 
membership has demanded and 
created, is University support 
and compensation for diversity 
labor, the kind of work that has 
long been unrecognized and 
undervalued, and ends up falling 
on the shoulders of those it is 
intended to benefit,” she said.

After several other women 

spoke to the crowd at Liberty 
Plaza, organizers led a march 
through downtown with chants 
of “No justice, no peace,” and 
“the people united can never be 
divided,” momentarily blocking 
traffic on some streets. Ann Arbor 
Police Department officers were 
also present, directing both traffic 
and protesters away from each 
other.

On Feb. 1, the Office of National 

Scholarships 
and 
Fellowships 

opened as a centralized office to 
provide information and advising 
on application processes for all 
University of Michigan students 
interested 
in 
postgraduate 

fellowship opportunities.

The office’s staff now provides 

information about opportunities 
such as the Rhodes Scholarship 
to Oxford University, the Truman 
Scholarship for graduate studies 
with a public service focus and the 
Marshall Scholarship for graduate 
studies in the United Kingdom. 
The staff will also provide advising 
through the application process, 
including 
putting 
students 
in 

contact with faculty who have won 
these scholarships in the past.

ONSF Director Henry Dyson 

said this office is a resource many 
of the University’s peer institutions 
already provide their students.

“This is something that most 

other universities have, and we 
didn’t have a central office that 
was doing it,” he said. “We had at 
that time as many as 10 different 
offices that were doing different

Close to 40 people filed into 

the Matthaei Botanical Gardens 
Auditorium Wednesday evening 
for a presentation on the effects 
deer have had on the parks of Ann 
Arbor, and in turn, the deer cull’s 
impact on local populations. The 
talk was hosted by Wild Ones, an 
organization aiming to protect 
native species of plants and 
animals.

The deer cull has been a 

controversial topic in Ann Arbor, 
with calls for the University of 
Michigan to cease its support of 
the cull, and for the city to stop 
funding the program entirely.

Presenter 
Jacqueline 

Courteau, 
a 
professional 

biologist who has studied the 
local 
environment 
for 
the 

past 20 years, acknowledged 
the 
program 
comes 
with 

considerable emotional baggage, 
and proceeded to outline policy 
and management implications 
from her research.

pieces of what my colleagues at 
other universities would have in a 
centralized system.”

He 
said 
the 
previous, 

decentralized system could be 
confusing for students and was 
part of the motivation for the 
creation of a centralized website 
and office.

“It used to be before we had a 

centralized office that you almost 
had to know what you were looking 
for before you could go hunt for it,” 
Dyson said.

ONSF is housed in LSA, and 

there will still be some scholarship 
opportunities 
coordinated 
by 

other 
departments, 
like 
the 

International Institute continuing 
to advise applications for Fulbright 
Fellowships. 
However, 
Dyson 

said the aim is to guide students 
in all colleges at the University 
in their pursuit of postgraduate 
scholarships and fellowships.

“We want to provide this as 

an LSA service to students, to the 
whole university and have our 
services be open and welcoming to 
all of those students,” he said.

LSA senior Amalia Gomez-

Rexrode, who was awarded a 
Truman Scholarship in 2016, 
wrote in an email interview how 
advisers played a vital role in her 
application.

“When planning on applying 

for the Truman Scholarship, I 
consistently met with Dr. Dyson 
who helped me every step of the 
way — he was instrumental in 
allowing me to put forth the best 
application possible,” she wrote.

Michigan 
alum 
Layne 

Vandenberg, recipient of a Fulbright 
Fellowship and a scholarship to 
complete a master’s degree at the 
Yenching Academy in Beijing in 
2015, also voiced the importance 
of advising in the application 
process. She initially disregarded 
the Yenching Scholarship and only 
applied because of encouragement 
from Dyson, her adviser.

“I saw and immediately deleted 

the email and thought, OK, this is 
for people who specialize in China, 
people who speak Chinese,” she 
said. “And I had never studied 
China at all. Not even a little bit. 
So I saw it and deleted it. And then 
Henry sent it to me again and was 
like, ‘Hey, did you see this?’ … He 
said, ‘I think you should just apply. 

I think that you would probably be 
a good candidate.’ ”

Vandenberg, after completing 

her master’s degree and Ph.D. 
in international studies, hopes 
to pursue a degree in sports 
governance. She said she felt 
Dyson’s help was a key component 
to 
her 
success 
with 
these 

experiences, with his focused 
suggestions of opportunities based 
on her interests as well as help 
through the process.

“I think I was competitive for 

some of these fellowships because 
I had people like Henry talking 
to me about my application and 
because I had the opportunity for 
a sounding board … he put this in 
front of me, and without him doing 
that, I wouldn’t be here.”

She said ONSF will reach a 

wider variety of students at the 
University and will allow more 
students to participate in programs 
similar to hers.

“This is going to be a great 

resource for students and I wish 
I had had it,” she said. “In a way I 
did, because I had Henry, but now 
other people are going to know 
who to go to and how to get that 
information. I think a lot more 
Michigan students are going to be 

able to do things like this.”

Dyson said in addition to 

informing more students about 
these different scholarships, 
he 
hopes 
more 
University 

students 
will 
also 
receive 

those scholarships. He said the 
University tends to perform 
well with some opportunities, 
like the Fulbright Fellowship, 
but lags in others, such as the 
Truman Scholarship and the 
Marshall Scholarship.

“Of course I’m competitive,” 

Dyson said. “I want to win. 
I want my students to win. 
There’s nothing happier than, 
you know, getting that excited 
phone call from a student who 
just found out that she’s got a 
full scholarship to Cambridge. 
It’s a wonderful experience. 
And then to celebrate that 
with the University to say this 
is a win for you. So, yeah, I 
definitely want to close the gap, 
I’ve got that competitive streak 
as well.”

“This was the only reason I left 

my house today,” said LSA senior 

Brittany Boyle as she stopped at a 

table in Mason Hall to write what 

it means to be a feminist, an annual 

event sponsored by Lean In to 

coincide with International Women’s 

Day.

Engineering junior Sonia Thosar, 

a member of the Lean In core team 

that hosted the event, described the 

organization as a group devoted to 

forging gender equality on campus.

“Lean In is an organization 

dedicated to gender parity and gender 

equality, so it’s not necessarily just 

female-oriented; it has to do with 

equality of gender,” she said.

Thosar explained the purpose of 

the table in Mason Hall was to raise 

awareness for what it means to be a 

feminist by having passersby write 

on whiteboards that had the prompt 

“I am a feminist because …,” and then 

posting on social media to spread the 

message. 

“We put this event on to 

destigmatize the word ‘feminist’ and 

to show you can take ownership of 

that word regardless of if you’re a boy 

or a girl or what you identify as, and to 

show what the word means to you to 

the entire campus,” Thosar said.

LSA freshman Deepthi 

Devireddy, also a member 

of an engagement team for 

Lean In, noted how much 

of a success the event was, 

specifically noting the men 

who stopped at the table.

“I think it’s really cool 

that we get a lot of guys 

coming to this as well, 

because I know Lean 

In is a primarily female 

organization, so it’s cool to 

have a lot of guys coming 

and feeling proud of saying 

that they are a feminist and 

giving really good reasons as 

to why they are,” Devireddy 

said.

There was a constant 

flow of people coming and 

going from the table, Thosar said, 

allowing the club’s message to spread 

through campus.

“We take the pictures and 

put them on social media to send 

the message that feminism is very 

multifaceted, and it means a lot to a 

lot of different people, and it’s not a 

bad word,” Thosar said.

We 
are 
a 
coalition 
of 

organizations 
committed 
to 

transforming 
the 
University 

of Michigan campus climate 
through policy change. We 
believe 
that 
the 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion strategic 
planning initiative will fail 
without financial investments 
into 
the 
infrastructure 

for DEI work: The current 
policy of expecting free labor 
from 
marginalized 
people 

undermines the integrity of the 
entire DEI campus enterprise.

Since 
the 
DEI 
strategic 

plans were released last fall, 
the University has repeatedly 
declared its aspirations for a 
truly diverse, equitable and 
inclusive campus environment. 
However, a recent decision by 
the University conflicts with 
this vision.

In 
December 
2016, 
the 

Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, the labor union 
representing Graduate Student 
Instructors 
and 
Graduate 

Student 
Staff 
Assistants, 

put forth a proposal to the 
University to create paid DEI 
positions for graduate students 
within each school unit. As 
part of negotiations for its labor 
contract, GEO proposed hiring 
at least one DEI GSSA per school 
unit 
at 
a 
20-hours-a-week 

appointment, with additional 
positions at larger schools such 
as LSA and Engineering. These 

GSSA roles would substantially 
increase the capacity of each 
school unit to implement their 
DEI plans, and officially place 
value on the diversity labor 
and expertise contributed by 
graduate students. Moreover, 
GSSA positions dedicated to 
DEI work would lift much 
of the labor burden off of 
students, faculty and staff who 
have 
historically 
done 
this 

work on a voluntary basis. Paid 
GSSA positions would make it 
possible for the University to 
be proactive on campus climate 
issues, rather than reactive, 
and institutionalize DEI labor 
as core to campus operations.

In February, the University 

rejected that proposal. As part 
of 
negotiation 
proceedings 

between GEO and Academic 
Human Resources, HR flatly 
rejected GEO’s proposal to 
fund GSSA positions for DEI 
labor in each campus unit. 
This concerns undergraduate 
students, 
graduate 
students, 

staff and faculty alike. It sends 
a message to our communities 
that the University does not 
place a high value on DEI labor 
if it is unwilling to pay for it.

Recent 
campus 
events 

ranging 
from 
racist 
and 

anti-Semitic emails to white 
supremacist fliers have made it 
abundantly clear that now more 
than ever the University needs 
to take proactive measures and 
ensure that each school unit 
has the capacity to respond 
to acts of hate efficiently and 
effectively. 
Without 
paid 

DEI positions as part of the 
University 
infrastructure, 

school units will continue to 
struggle when responding to 
such incidents as they arise.

We call on the University to 

meaningfully 
integrate 
DEI 

labor into the structure of 
our institution by hiring and 
paying students to support the 
implementation of DEI plans. 
We specifically declare our 
endorsement of GEO’s proposal 
to create paid DEI graduate 
student staff positions. In doing 
so, we join the more than 900 
students, faculty and staff who 
have signed a petition in support 
of the proposal. Several of our 

organizations have previously 
described the need for fair 
compensation 
for 
diversity 

labor and the importance of 
investing in human resources 
in order to address inequalities 
in the distribution of diversity 
labor on campus. There is 
clear and broad support for the 

creation of paid DEI positions.

Hiring GSSAs across school 

units 
would 
substantially 

increase 
staff 
capacity 
to 

implement DEI strategic plans. 
Most campus units have formed 
working groups and committees 
to begin the work of developing 
and implementing such plans. 
These 
advisory 
committees 

serve an important role in 
overseeing progress, but they 
are not equipped to carry out 
the day-to-day tasks involved in 
actual implementation. Those 
who serve on the committees 
do so voluntarily, and on top 
of their existing job duties, 
academic workload or both. 
Meetings held once a month 
or once a semester are not 
enough to promote systemic 
change within any campus 
unit. These facts coupled with 
the high turnover rate most 
committees 
experience, 
as 

students and faculty move on 
to serve other needs, can make 
DEI 
committees 
ineffective. 

Expecting school units to adhere 
to aggressive implementation 
timelines in the absence of 
paid staff dedicated to doing 
this work is both unrealistic 
and unsustainable. By hiring 
graduate students to support 
implementation 
activities, 

GEO’s proposal addresses the 
widespread 
capacity 
issues 

faced by diversity initiatives 
across campus.

Creating paid DEI positions 

would also harness valuable 
student 
expertise 
that 
has 

yet to be utilized through 
formal mechanisms. Students 
at the University have been 
successfully organizing around 
issues of race, gender and 
class for a long time. Leaders 
from across our organizations 
are 
routinely 
tapped 
as 

“on-the-ground” 
experts 
by 

administrators 
and 
asked 

to engage in diversity labor 
because of their knowledge of 
power dynamics and systems 
of oppression as they apply 
to 
University 
settings. 
In 

fact, 
many 
school-specific 

DEI plans tout the successes 
of student-led DEI efforts as 
their 
own. 
However, 
these 

students have largely engaged 
in 
diversity 
labor 
through 

informal channels, providing 
their recommendations on an 
unpaid basis to school officials 
who have limited expertise 
on issues related to race and 
inequality. Deans and chairs 
overwhelmingly 
hail 
from 

socially privileged groups and 
have not been tested on their 
qualifications 
to 
implement 

DEI plans effectively. Their lack 
of both lived and professional 
experience 
in 
this 
domain 

means that they rely heavily on 
students to engage in diversity 
labor for them. By screening 
and 
hiring 
for 
the 
most 

qualified 
applicants, 
GEO’s 

DEI 
GSSA 
proposal 
would 

create 
official, 
recognized 

roles dedicated to diversity 
labor. Graduate students with 
DEI expertise are uniquely 
positioned to assist with the 
effective 
implementation 
of 

strategic plans, because they 
know how to effectively engage 
with and gather information 
from 
students, 
faculty 
and 

staff constituencies, including 
those 
from 
marginalized 

communities.

Most 
importantly, 
GEO’s 

proposal 
promotes 
social 

equity by lifting the diversity 
labor burden off of minority 
and underrepresented faculty, 
students, and staff who engage 
in this work on an unpaid 
basis. 
DEI 
work 
continues 

to fall disproportionately on 

people of color, women, LGBTQ 
people, and religious/cultural 
minorities. Because this work 
is almost always voluntary, 
it 
means 
that 
folks 
from 

marginalized 
backgrounds 

end up assuming the costs 
themselves. 
Scholars 
have 

documented 
the 
ways 
that 

diversity labor diverts attention 
away 
from 
activities 
that 

promote professional success 
and harms the mental well-
being of women and minorities. 
When engagement with DEI 
initiatives is strictly voluntary, 
this 
reproduces 
the 
very 

inequalities they are supposed 
to eliminate. Students from 
marginalized backgrounds are 
especially vulnerable to this 
type of labor exploitation from 
the University.

People engaging in diversity 

labor 
must 
be 
adequately 

compensated 
and 
protected 

from potential retaliation by 
those in positions of power. It is 
not enough to hire individuals 
as hourly employees and pay 
them at minimum wage. DEI 
work is intense and difficult 
work because topics like race 
and gender can be seen as 
controversial. The challenging 
nature of the work mandates 

union 
protection 
to 
guard 

against retaliation and ensure 
an independent procedure for 
resolving grievances. No one 
engaging in diversity work 
should be subject to negative 
professional 
or 
personal 

consequences for doing so. By 
incorporating DEI GSSAs into 
the graduate employee union, 
GEO confers the same benefits 
and 
protections 
owed 
to 

graduate student laborers who 
keep this university running.

At its core, diversity work 

is a labor issue. Unpaid labor 
should be a concern to everyone 
in our community, particularly 
because it disproportionately 
affects people who are now 
under attack by hate groups 
here in Michigan and across 
the nation. Until our concerns 
about how diversity labor is 
uncompensated and unfairly 
distributed 
are 
addressed, 

statements 
from 
University 

administrators 
about 
the 

importance of DEI work will 
continue to ring hollow. Join

Michigan that Diversity Labor

Don’t 
forget 
about 
Flint. 

People there still don’t have 
clean water.

I’m 
from 
Flint, 
lucky 
to 

have my water untainted and 
saddened by the hundreds of 
homes ruined, people poisoned 
and voices unheard.

We must never forget about 

Flint. The aftereffects of lead 
poisoning will continue to harm 
and haunt many for the years to 
come. May we learn from this 
negligence and work and speak 
so something like this will never 
happen again.

The following is a poem I 

wrote a year ago when the 
coverage of the crisis was just 
beginning:

Water That Has To 
Boil

I hold in my hand a map that 
pinpoints every area where lead 
is in the water
Just yesterday I said that we, 
that y’all weren’t going to keel 
over
That’s what the governor said 
too
But Rick Snyder knew that it 
was a possibility in a different 
kind of way
That we, that y’all were going 
to die
People die here all the time, 
we’re desensitized to what 
comes as a shock to another 
town’s news
I say “we” because I’m a 
Flintstone too, I say “y’all” 

because my water isn’t tainted 
and because
I use my cousin’s death by 
getting shot, my grandmother’s 
old 
address, 
my 
father’s 

high school alma mater, my 
familiarity to the city and its 
danger as sorry examples of 
street cred
I end my envelopes: Flint, 
Michigan 48532
But I’m in the middle of Flint 
and Flint Township, smudged a 
block in between the two
There is a flaw in this thinking
Do I not live in Flint because 
I don’t live where the crime is 
mostly concentrated?
Flint Township isn’t at all 
sunshine and rainbows, but 
Flint isn’t just eclipses and 
gunshots
We’re nearly one and the same, 
we share a name, families, 
histories, stories
It’s we, y’all

I look at the map once again
Damn, I am literally a block 
away from having my water 
look like piss and shit
What 
if 
my 
parents 
were 

potentially going to buy a house 
a minute more east?
But when the water plant made 
blueprints, this is where they 
stopped
A block away from my house
Once I cross Ballenger, the 
water turns to a broth
It’s alphabet soup, the names 
we forget in the Rolling Stone 
columns that put the scope on 
lives that have been demolished
The last time I was at a soup 
kitchen, I saw what I thought 
were polar opposites
A 
one-legged 
man 
in 
a 

wheelchair followed by a man 
in a three-piece suit with a 

Rolex on his wrist
But they were one and the 
same; they both were hungry 
and wanted company
Sometimes it’s nice to listen to 
voices
Or have yours listened to
A boy no older than 8 steps up
He isn’t even tall enough to see 
over the counter
But he directs us to fill plates 
for his three younger siblings 
like a seasoned parent
And I talk to them afterward —
“I don’t have a dad”
“I’m hungry”
One screams and yells in a 
tantrum

That’s what’s happening right 
now
Flintstones protest and babies 
kick and scream, scared of 
water that’s their Kryptonite
We get a response of, “I’m sorry 
this happened”
Later he says, “I’m sorry”
Well I’m not sorry, but how 
the **** are you still in office, 
Snyder?
I was about to address you as 
Mr., but I have no respect for 
you
My face twisted at the mention 
of your name since the moment 
your laws cut my mom and her 
friends’ pay because they’re 
teachers
You claim you’re one tough nerd
But let’s try one weak negligent

Every time you open your 
mouth with your American flag 
lapel on your jacket,
The North Side flies real ones 
upside down at half-mast
How do you smile?
How 
can 
you 
smile 
with 

cameras flashing when you 
knew of this months ago?
And did nothing
How could you send water to 
state employees in the city at 
the same time and now claim,
Oh, yeah, that was for the 
public too!

But it wasn’t just the smug 
smiling governor

Keith 
Creagh 
and 
the 

Department of Environmental 
Quality covered up proof of 
astronomical amounts of lead
Susan Hedman scoffed at a 
House memo that would’ve 
sent in the cavalry before the 
cavalry was needed
The 
emergency 
manager, 

Darnell Earley, put his name 
that should live in infamy on 
the dotted line to save a mere 
$5 million
What are the damages now, 
Darnell?
And 
this 
was 
after 
an 

incompetent city council voted 
7-1 in 2013 to switch back to 
Detroit water
A council that includes my 
dad’s drunken DUI childhood 
neighbor made a better decision 
than people who went to school 
for political science
Get this, political science:
The lead levels has been found 
as high as 104 ppb 
The federal maximum is 15
I saw Mr. Walling, the former 
mayor, praying in the chapel 
an hour before service every 
Sunday

And what about the city as a 
whole?
This would not happen in a 
majority white / affluent city
Think of the steps taken there 
just to water the tulips and 
lilies
And 
this 
majority-Black 

population lives in what looks 
like a third-world country
Ailing, dying from diseases 
nobody has ever heard of before
Legionnaires

I once wrote about the rise of 
the city, but we’ve been sent 
into a Hell
Back 
to 
looking 
semi-

apocalyptic
My 
subdivision 
is 
getting 

darker so my mom won’t go to 
the Kroger around the corner 
alone anymore
The 
town 
is 
now 
more 

inescapable than it was before 

and neighborhoods are cell 
blocks
Homes 
are 
literally 
worth 

nothing because it’s illegal to 
sell them and who wants to 
move here now?
But residents still received 
fliers of babies smiling in a 
bathtub, telling parents that it 
was OK to bathe their children 
in water that didn’t look like 
water
Again, a covertness to reveal 
the truth and a smile
Remember Ronald McDonald
The only thing people can do 
now to help is to send plastic 
water bottles to a food desert 
where some are forced to desert 
to fast food 
The damage has been done and 
this just adds to the multitude 
of problems
When I read my local paper, 
it’s not just the water that has 
to boil
The heat on our faces evaporates 
tears
There’s always a shoulder to cry 
on
Like 
murder, 
it’s 
somehow 

become commonplace to leave a 
sleeve soaking wet

Kids in the inner city have 
sleeves that are holy
Their community is set up to 
fail and it takes more than sheer 
will-power to have the power
Outsiders hear you’re from here 
and give you a look of disgust
I’ll never forget the raised 
heads 
and 
closed 
mouths 

disconnecting a sigh when I say 
my hometown’s name
Flint — like it’s the Lord’s name 
in vain
It makes you feel like less of a 
person on top of the experiment 
you’ve been treated like
The pride of being born and 
raised fades — a hometown 
burden

I think a lot of people forgot
Like people will forget
They’ll forget about Flint like 
always and they’ll forget the 
decades it’ll take to replace 

pipes and the near year until 
everything is relatively back to 
normal
But this isn’t just something 
you can put a blanket over like 
the blatant statements putting 
down this city
The half-life of lead is still alive 
in bloodstreams
Traumatic 
experiences 
for 

human 
beings 
cannot 
be 

forgotten overnight
Children who already have 
low IQs will have scores that 
continue to tumble
And the impact of stupidity will 
reign for years to come
From a stupid governor and his 
staff
To a sadly stupid kid who will 
make a bad choice
Because think about it, at least 
one of these children harmed 
will take a life
People don’t just die from the 
water poisoning
They die from guns and cars 
and knives too
Which will be held by those 
who were told that the water 
was safe to drink
That’s what happened to my 
cousin over a decade ago

At the same hospital I was born 
in, they’ll give children teddy 
bears
The media put a two-year-old 
on the cover of Time
This isn’t the press we wanted, 
nor deserved
We hate that the story told 
about Flint is a negative one
In what was once an oasis, we 
don’t look for water
We look for Pb and THMs
Holding on to hope and asking 
why to fathers and Father
I don’t know where everybody 
is or how my extended family is 
doing
So I just hold this map
Outside a city near death
On its last breath
But it’ll take two more, then 
three

We won’t suffocate
We won’t die of thirst

GEO’s proposal 
promotes social 
equity by lifting 
the diversity labor 

burden

We call on the 
University to 
meaningfully 
integrate DEI 
labor into the 
structure of our 

institution


W

ith 
Republicans 

now at the helm of 
both the legislative 

and executive branches, the last 
couple of months have 
been 
riddled 
with 

uncertainty over the 
future 
of 
women’s 

health care. From the 
return of the global gag 
rule to the attempted 
reinforcement of the 
Hyde Amendment, the 
new 
administration 

has 
flippantly 
dealt 

blow after blow against 
pro-choice policies on 
an international scale.

However, 
it 
wasn’t 
until 

Congress voted to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act and threw 
legislative 
stones 
at 
Planned 

Parenthood’s federal funding that 
I finally realized the gravity of this 
political turbulence: If the GOP has 
its way with women’s health care, I 
could lose access to birth control 
altogether. It is for this reason — 
and, frankly, because there are 
very few painful, long-lasting 
procedures I would not withstand 
to keep the Paul Ryans of the world 
from playing my reproductive 
organs like a GameCube controller 
— that I finally decided, after 
wrestling with the idea for months, 
to get an IUD.

For those of you who are not 

super well-versed in the fascinating 
world of birth control methods, 
an intrauterine device is a tiny, 
T-shaped piece of plastic that you 
insert into the uterus to prevent 
pregnancy. There are two types 
of IUDs: copper and hormonal. 
While I got the copper one, both 
work by thickening the mucus in 
your cervix to prevent sperm from 
reaching the egg, and they can last 
up to 12 years (or three presidential 
terms) with more than 99-percent 
effectiveness. When you’re ready 
to start a family, you simply ask 
your doctor to remove it and BAM: 
instant fertility.

I won’t sugarcoat it: The 

procedure itself is excruciating, 
but it only lasts a couple of 
minutes. You can get it done at 
a gynecologist or at your local 
Planned Parenthood (where I 
opted to get mine). Let me walk 
you through my experience so you 
can get a sense of what to expect 
if you ever decide to follow suit, 
keeping in mind potential barriers 
some women might encounter in 
their pursuit of bodily autonomy.

To begin, you should probably 

carve out a few hours in your day 
and schedule an appointment. 
For women with children or full-
time jobs, this is enough of an 
impediment to make the entire 
process nearly impossible. In 

preparation for your visit, make 
sure you eat, drink lots of fluids 
and take some ibuprofen. If you’re 
fortunate enough to have reliable 

transportation, 
you 

should secure a ride 
to and from the clinic, 
because you will not 
feel like driving when 
you’re done.

When you arrive, 

endure the wait until 
they call your name. 
If you’re as lucky as I 
was, the lobby will be 
playing reruns of “The 
Fresh Prince of Bel-

Air,” and occasionally someone 
in the room will rap along to the 
theme song. Did I mention you 
should probably have insurance? 
Yeah, both the device and the 
procedure can cost up to $1,000, 
which is why many women forgo it 
as an option.

Once you’re inside, the doctor 

will evaluate you. Have you had 
unprotected sex in the last month? 
When was your last period? Do you 
usually have a heavy flow or a light 
one? Are you allergic to iodine?

Then, they’ll do a pregnancy 

test just to be safe, as being 
pregnant with an IUD is bad 
news bears. This entails the 
always glamorous act of pissing in 
a cup, so that’s where those fluids 
will come in handy.

Finally, 
once 
all 
of 
the 

formalities are out of the way, 
the doctor will perform the 
procedure. First, they’ll check 
your uterine alignment (I was 
informed that I have a tiny cervix, 
to which I bewilderedly replied, 
“Thank you”). Then, they’ll insert 
a large speculum into your vagina 
to keep everything, uh, out of the 
way. Lastly, they’ll put the IUD 
in place. A slight pinch. A wave 
of terrible cramps. A few seconds 
pass. Another wave of terrible 
cramps. All done.

You’ll walk out of that clinic 

feeling like someone kicked you 
in the uterus, and you’ll probably 
have to deal with cramps and 
spotting for about a week or so 
if all goes well and there are no 
infections. Women who cannot 
afford to take time off work to rest 
will have to find a way to distract 
themselves from feeling as though 
they’re giving birth to a set of 
knives — but, hey, that’s just the 
price of reproductive freedom.

Believe it or not, I’m not the 

only one who jumped at the 
chance to insert a foreign object 
into my uterus as a frantic and 
final attempt at bodily autonomy. 
Since the election, the demand 
for these suckers has increased by 
900 percent as women everywhere 
are scrambling to protect the last 

shreds of their right to choose in 
the Trump administration.

Sure, months ago, I could have 

carefully 
weighed 
my 
birth-

control options to figure out which 
was best-suited for my body and 
my lifestyle. If I couldn’t remember 
to take the pill every day, I could 
switch to NuvaRing. If I didn’t like 
the shot, I could try a cervical cap. 
Now, however, there is a greater 
sense of urgency. I feel like I can’t 
choose something I would need to 
replace or refill every few weeks 
because the possibility that my 
insurance may not cover the cost 
or that my health-care provider 
may not even exist in a few weeks 
will always linger in the back of 
my mind. If Republicans make 
good on their threats to roll back 
reproductive-health coverage or 
defund Planned Parenthood, I’m 
totally screwed.

And my concerns pale in 

comparison to the effect these 
legislative hits will have on low-
income women, who make up 80 
percent of Planned Parenthood’s 
clientele. 
Studies 
show 
that 

unintended 
pregnancies 
occur 

disproportionately in communities 
with 
high 
concentrations 

of poverty, and this can be 
traced directly to disparities in 
contraceptive access and use. What 
are these women supposed to do 
when lawmakers roll back access 
to birth control and government 
services at the same time? Where 
will they turn when they are 
unable to provide for families they 
were stripped of the right to plan 
themselves? What then?

The Trump administration has 

it completely backward if it believes 
that cutting reproductive-health 
care will accomplish anything 
other than endangering the lives 
of millions of women. After all, 
these services are difficult enough 
to obtain without Republican 
lawmakers 
introducing 
their 

skewed notions of justice into 
them. We should instead be 
working to increase birth-control 
accessibility and affordability so 
women like me don’t have to take 
drastic measures to ensure they’ll 
be protected.

IUDs should be a choice, not a 

last resort; and though I can rest 
easy knowing that I’ll probably 
be safe if lawmakers decide to 
turn back the clock 50 years 
on women’s health care, many 
other women can’t. In the land 
of the free, if we have to undergo 
a 
painful, 
inconvenient 
and 

expensive procedure to ensure we 
won’t be fucked over by stringent 
legislation, how free are we, really?

“I

t ain’t what you know 
that 
gets 
you 
into 

trouble. It’s what you 

know for sure that just ain’t so.” – 
Mark Twain

After arriving home 

for Spring Break just 
a short two weeks 
ago, my parents and 
I watched the movie 
“Hacksaw 
Ridge,” 

based on a true story 
of U.S. Army corporal, 
Desmond Doss, who 
saved 75 people in the 
battle of Okinawa. Each 
year my parents aspire 
to watch all the Oscar-
nominated movies before the 
awards ceremony, and this was the 
final one on the list. Serendipity 
is a beautiful thing, as the movie 
climaxed in a scene that affirmed 
the relevance of Twain’s prescient 
quote — with particular pertinence 
to current political discord.

The 
left’s 
appetite 
for 

persistently 
disparaging 
and 

obstructing incendiary storytelling 
was no more revealed last week 
than when Senate Minority Leader 
Chuck Schumer immediately called 
for Attorney General Jeff Sessions 
to resign for an answer he provided 
during his confirmation hearing.

However, the objections to 

Sessions’s Russian contacts are 
completely 
unfounded. 
In 
his 

confirmation 
hearing, 
Sessions 

answered 
a 
limited 
question 

regarding whether or not the 
Trump campaign had any contact 
with Russian officials. While it 
has been revealed Sessions did 
meet with Russian officials, he 
did not perjure himself. Sessions 
met in his capacity as a senator, 
not on behalf of or as an agent of 
the Trump campaign. While this 
distinction seems quite clear, many 
high-ranking Democrats, Schumer 
included, have disregarded the 
context of the meeting and his 
answer. Schumer seemed to smell 
blood, posing the opportunity for an 
easy political attack that cared little 
about trying to fully understand the 
limited disclosure.

I was not surprised by Schumer’s 

unwillingness, or perhaps inability 
to 
understand 
the 
situation, 

recalling his response to Trump’s 
call for unity, immigration reform 
and 
infrastructure 
spending 

during his address to Congress: 
“(It) was one of the most anti-
immigrant 
speeches 
that 
we 

heard any president ever give.” 
It might be said that Democratic 
leaders understand Sessions, but 
simply don’t care one way or the 
other if their resistance is purely 
calculated and political.

What is so troubling — and why 

I appreciated “Hacksaw Ridge” 
— is that Schumer, Pelosi and 

many others on the left remind 
me of Smitty (Luke Bracey), 
Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) 
and 
Captain 
Glover 
(Sam 

Worthington.) 
They 

each were certain that 
Desmond Doss was 
a coward, but it just 
wasn’t so.

Desmond 
Doss 

was a young enlistee 
in the army who was 
ridiculed, beaten and 
nearly court-martialed 
for his conviction that 
he not use a firearm 
during the war. His 
values originated from 

his Seventh-day Adventist religious 
beliefs. Despite little doubt of his 
cowardice and liability by his fellow 
soldiers, history reveals that he 
was awarded the Medal of Honor 
for service above and beyond 
the call of duty during the battle 
of Okinawa. In one scene, Doss 
spends the night in a foxhole with 
Smitty, a squad mate who was the 
first to call him a coward.

Only after Doss shares the 

history behind his aversion to 
holding a weapon does Smitty 
apologize for doubting his courage, 
and the two make amends. Smitty 
dies that night but Doss rescues 
more than 70 injured soldiers 
including Sergeant Howell, who 
had been most abusive to him 
during basic training. Near the 
end of the movie, Captain Glover, 
who had been one of Doss’s 
staunchest critics, tells him that 
the men had been inspired by his 
miraculous efforts and that they 
refused to launch their next attack 
without him. Glover himself admits 
to Doss that he had never been so 
wrong about a person before, and 
asks for forgiveness.

Prior to acknowledging this, 

however, Glover and the entire 
squad had been very misguided. 
Their interpretation of Doss had 
been incorrect. The current political 
frenzy in which breaking stories 
— by virtue of their messenger and 
the messenger’s certainty — seem 
to become authentic, informative 
and fact-based may also prove 
misguided! Seeing in “Hacksaw 
Ridge” the destructiveness of an 
“it’s what you know that just 
ain’t so” attitude illuminates the 
perilous consequence of the left’s 
narrow optics and unwillingness 
to seek first to understand Trump 
and his surrogates.

Twain’s quote references the 

basis for the nonfictional prejudice, 
bias and arrogance expressed by 
Doss’s squad mates in “Hacksaw 
Ridge.” This same bias, partisanship 
and arrogance fuels persistent 
intimation by the left that Trump 
himself, or his surrogates, colluded 
with the Russians to influence the 

results of the presidential election. 
Calls for a special prosecutor rest 
solely on the presumption that 
there is evidence out there and 
that it’ll take a neutral, nonpartisan 
party to reveal it. However, not a 
single fact has been provided by the 
left to support its claims.

Of course, it’s hard to prove 

a negative, and as a result, the 
stories will continue as long as 
an appetite to destroy Trump’s 
agenda 
continues. 
Trump, 

in fact, has been extremely 
consistent in delivering exactly 
what he promised. There has 
been no bait-and-switch. The 
man will not change — even to 
a fault. He has built a team of 
experts on his cabinet that will 
mitigate his weaknesses.

Trump’s call for unity during 

his recent address to Congress 
invites folks such as Schumer and 
Pelosi to become part of the team. 
He understands that a strong team 
requires maximizing the benefit of 
different perspectives. Yet, blinding 
bias seems to restrict their capacity 
to lay aside differences and engage 
in fruitful dialogue.

Reciprocity, in this case, requires 

that naysayers give something — 
that they participate. They appear 
only to want to take by persistently 
aiming to discredit, destroy and 
delegitimize. Schumer’s call for a 
Sessions resignation and Pelosi’s 
call for a Trump impeachment are 
akin to Captain Glover’s call for a 
Doss court martial. This rush to 
judgment is scandalous in its own 
right. It is force-feeding a narrative 
derived from a fear of change, at 
the very least. Peggy Noonan, in a 
recent article titled “Washington 
Still Reels From the Quake of 2016” 
recommends: “The ground beneath 
Washington’s feet shifted. People 
here need to get over their shock 
and start recognizing the new lay 
of the land.”

I submit that the numerous 

stories that abound in the current 
political reality are just that: stories. 
And in response, alternative stories 
emerge. 
Ultimately, 
none 
are 

necessarily right or wrong, but, 
when discussed together, the sum 
results in a dialogue, and perhaps 
— at the end of this process — a 
modicum of mutual understanding 
develops. Of course, allowing this 
dialogue to occur may deprive 
Schumer and his colleagues an 
opportunity for more stinging 
sound bites, but we all might be 
more informed by the process, 
without a rush to judgment.

As I think about it, both Schumer 

and Pelosi might consider becoming 
more relevant by jumping into the 
foxhole with President Trump.

SCHANDEVEL

T

he last two weeks of class 
before Spring Break were 
rough; 
it 
seemed 
like 

midterms and projects popped 
up one after another. After my 
midterms were over, I 
needed something to 
distract me from the 
drop my grades were 
going to take and put me 
into a positive mindset 
for Spring Break. 

I saw the posters 

for 
events 
at 
the 

Canterbury 
House 

called “A Night For Us: 
Colorful Soul” around 
campus. They showed 
artwork of a woman with a massive 
afro with the words “live music” 
and “poetry readings” above her. I 
had always wanted to go, but I never 
could because of an upcoming test 
or homework. Since my midterms 
were behind me, there was nothing 
stopping me. One of my friends, 
also searching for a distraction from 
the horror known as exam season, 
wanted to go too, so we met up and 
walked over to the Canterbury 
House together.

We could hear the music from 

across the street. After looking both 
ways, we ran across East Huron 
toward the Canterbury House. We 
came in and walked into the room 
where jazz was playing. There was 
a good number of people, but not 
so many that you couldn’t move 
around or felt claustrophobic, and 
everyone was standing up listening 
to the music — no one was staring at 
their phone or drunkenly teetering 
from side to side. 

As I looked around the room, 

I noticed how eclectic the group 
around me was. Most of the people 
looked like young college students, 
but there were also people in their 

thirties or forties. People wore 
everything from sweatpants to 
berets and oxfords. There were 
Black people, white people and Asian 
people. I didn’t feel any pressure to 

be a certain way, and I 
didn’t feel out of place.

That was one of the 

few times in college 
I didn’t act excited, 
though I actually was. 
I didn’t have to pretend 
like I liked the music that 
was playing. I wasn’t 
bored, 
or 
annoyed, 

and I didn’t want to be 
anywhere else.

Despite this, I wasn’t 

as comfortable as I would have liked 
to be. I wished I could be like one 
woman I saw there. She was on the 
other side of the room, smiling and 
dancing to the rhythm. It was like 
she was in her own world; she only 
looked straight ahead at the band 
and paid attention to the music.

She reminded me of the friend I 

was with; I even joked, “That’s you 
in the future.” My friend is the type 
of person who will start playing 
reggaeton on Spotify in an empty 
dorm lounge and force people 
passing by to dance with her. While 
we were at the Canterbury House, 
she tried to get me to dance but I 
wanted to stick with what most of 
the other people in the room were 
doing, so I just tapped my foot along 
with the music. I leaned against the 
wall because I didn’t want to attract 
attention or stick out as one of the 
few people dancing.

When there were only a few 

people left in the audience, a girl 
came up and started to sing “On 
& On” by Erykah Badu. Listening 
to her sing reminded me of when 
I was young; instead of being 
nervous, unsure and on the brink of 

adulthood, I was a kid in my mom’s 
car listening to the R&B station. I 
was the type of person who would 
try to start a “Soul Train” line and 
run to an empty dance floor at a 
wedding. I wasn’t afraid of having 
fun or looking silly and I didn’t care 
who saw me.

By this time, all the people left 

in the audience were dancing. 
It would be weird to be the only 
one standing still, so I started to 
dance. I had fun earlier, but I had 
so much more fun once I actually 
started dancing — when I did what 
I wanted instead of trying to blend 
in. It would’ve been a good idea to 
do it sooner. I could have, but it felt 
like something wouldn’t let me.

I know that just going along with 

what a group does is silly, but it can 
be difficult to do something different 
or new. We’re told to “be ourselves” 
but conditioned to fit in so that we 
make friends or avoid being a target 
for bullies. This process erodes our 
willingness to express ourselves 
freely. We’re afraid of being labeled 
“weird” so we become restricted to a 
constant state of fear and struggle to 
fully enjoy ourselves or be comfortable 
when we could be judged.

To free ourselves of these 

restrictions, the answer may be to 
constantly do things we expect to be 
embarrassing and act like we don’t 
care. But for me, this is easier said 
than done. When I force myself 
(or am forced by my friend) to do 
something I know will make me 
feel awkward, I usually have to 
give myself a pep talk or pretend 
I’m Beyoncé to remind myself to 
be less insecure.

Wolverines trying 
to keep perspective 
about postseason 
future coming up

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team accomplished 
a number of notable feats this 
season. The Wolverines have 
tied their record for wins in 
a single season with 22 and 
finished third in the Big Ten 
for just the fourth time in 
school history. They should 
also earn their seventh NCAA 
Tournament bid and second 
under 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico. On paper, this year has 
been a major success for the 
Wolverines. 

But 
the 

way 
the 

regular 
season 

progressed also 
left 
Michigan 

disappointed. 
Three 
weeks 

ago, 
the 

Wolverines 
were No. 20 in 
the AP poll and 
projected 
to 

be a No. 6 seed in the NCAA 
Tournament. 
After 
losing 

four of its final five games — 
including two to rival Michigan 
State — Michigan has fallen to 
a No. 10 seed in most bracket 
projections.

Despite the poor finish, the 

Wolverines insist that they 
are capable of appreciating the 
larger picture of the season.

“You’re 
starting 
to 
see 

teams with the big names, 
and you start seeing 20 wins, 
21 wins, and then you realize, 
‘Hey, Michigan has 22,’ ” said 
Michigan 
assistant 
coach 

Megan Duffy on WTKA radio. 
“It’s hard in the day-to-day 
grind of it to take a step back 
and see the big picture of what 
you’ve done this year. One 
thing Coach (Barnes) Arico 
has been great about this year 
is trying to seize the moment, 
appreciate the win and don’t 
get too high or too low.”

Perspective 
and 
patience 

are two qualities Michigan 
will 
need 
abundantly 
over 

the next several days. Since 
the Wolverines lost 74-64 to 
the Spartans in the Big Ten 
quarterfinals, they do not have 
any more scheduled games. 
Michigan has to wait until 
the selection show Monday to 
learn its postseason fate.

Yet, plans have already been 

made for that day, regardless of 
what happens.

“We’ll get the team together 

and just kind of celebrate,” 
Duffy said. “It’s a neat evening 
for women’s basketball.”

The Wolverines have proven 

during the season that they 
are capable of responding to 
adversity. Following each of 
its first five defeats, Michigan 
retaliated with a victory in 
the next contest. All but one of 
those wins came by at least 20 
points.

This 
time, 
though, 

responding positively will take 
more work. After not losing 
back-to-back games prior to 
Feb. 17, the Wolverines have 
now 
suffered 
consecutive 

setbacks 
twice. 
Should 

Michigan earn a tournament 
bid as expected, it will have 
to go for a bounce-back win 
as an underdog in the NCAA 
Tournament.

To help with the process 

of 
turning 
things 
around, 

Michigan brought in help from 
a fellow basketball coach.

“(Men’s 
basketball 
coach 

John) Beilein came into our 
office,” Duffy said. “He said, 
‘You can’t let something like 
this dictate your season. And 
even going forward with your 
kids into the tournament, it’s 

a clean slate.’ They look to us 
and how we’re going to react in 
a lot of ways. And we’ve talked 
about not getting too upset or 
disappointed, just using it in 
a positive way. Let’s fix some 
things. Let’s get back to the 
basics.”

Another challenge for this 

team in seeing the bigger 
picture is the fact that none 
of 
the 
current 
Wolverines 

have ever participated in an 
NCAA Tournament game, as 
Michigan’s 
last 
appearance 

came in 2013. Barnes Arico’s 
staff, though, has plenty of 

experience 
in 

the Big Dance.

“I told them, 

even as simple 
as, 
when 
you 

watch games on 
TV, watch how 
teams 
show 

emotion,” Duffy 
said. 
“Watch 

how they’re so 
fired up for each 
other. 
Watch 

Derrick Walton right now as 
a senior. Those are the type 
of things that if you just seep 
some of that in, you’re going to 
see some positive results.”

One Wolverine who has a 

series of positive results has 
been junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, who scored 618 points 
this year and was a consensus 
selection to the All-Big Ten 
First 
Team. 
Still, 
Flaherty 

admitted that sometimes it’s 
hard to take a step back and see 
the larger picture.

“Sometimes I get so caught 

up in the little things,” Flaherty 
said. “Coming here, I used to 
be stressed out by everything 
you could imagine. (Barnes 
Arico and Duffy) have helped 
me enjoy being here and enjoy 
playing for this university.”

Duffy 
echoed 
Flaherty’s 

sentiments, 
and 
offered 
a 

reason for Flaherty’s anxiety.

“She comes in sometimes and 

is like, ‘Coach, I did really bad!’ 
” Duffy said. “I’m like, ‘Girl, you 
had 20 points and six assists,’ or 
something. But they’re always 
looking at something that might 
not be what we’re looking at 
and striving for perfection. As 
a coaching staff, we have to say 
‘Maybe you had some moments 
where you weren’t that great. 
But other times, you were really 
good and you have to still build 
off of that.’ ”

Whether or not Michigan 

can 
follow 
Duffy’s 
advice, 

building on the positives of 
the season while keeping the 
recent 
struggles 
in 
proper 

perspective, will go a long 
way in determining if the 
Wolverines — should they earn 
a bid — can pull an upset in the 
NCAA Tournament and notch 
their program-record 23rd win 
this season.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Betsa reaches new heights as senior

It seems unlikely that a 

pitcher with over 546 career 
innings, 789 strikeouts and 
a career earned-run average 
below two entering her senior 
season 
could 
make 
a 
big 

improvement. 

But in the early season, 

Michigan right-hander Megan 
Betsa has done just that — 
looking to stamp her legacy 
as one of the greatest pitchers 
in Michigan history with an 
improbable 
breakout 
senior 

season.

With 19 games in the books — 

and notably having faced some 
of the strongest opposition 
she will face all year, with 
five 
starts 
against 
ranked 

opponents already — Betsa is 
heading toward career bests 
across the board. Her ERA, 
1.69, would be a career best, as 
would the 350-plus strikeouts 
she is on pace for.

The low ERA and high 

strikeout total, though, are 
nothing new for the pitcher, as 
she’s been productive in those 
areas her entire career.

Coming off a fall season in 

which she did not pitch due to 
lingering injuries, Michigan’s 
ace did not rest on her laurels, 
setting out to lower her walk 
total and pitch count in order to 
allow her to throw more innings. 
So far, the improvements have 
been evident.

Her 27 walks through 66 

innings put her on pace for 
the lowest output since her 
freshman year, when she threw 
just 130 innings total. Betsa’s 
strikeout-to-walk ratio now sits 
at 4.26, a number that would 
exceed her career-best by a full 
strikeout (3.20 in 2015).

“We talked a little bit this 

past trip about not trying to nit-
pick the corners so much, and 
just spin the ball over the plate,” 
Betsa said. “Because as long as 
it’s spinning it’s still gonna move 
and they’ll still have a tough 
time hitting it. So not trying to 
be so perfect on the corners.”

Perhaps the most notable 

development 
with 
Betsa, 

however, is the optimism about 
her durability going forward. 

Taking off time in the fall, 

she and Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins believed, would be the 
best way to assure her health for 
the 
postseason. 

In a sport whose 
postseason 
can 

be 
controlled 

by one pitcher 
throwing 
virtually 
every 

game, 
Betsa 

will 
be 
the 

Wolverines’ 
most 
valuable 

weapon as they 
head deeper into 
the season. And by all accounts, 
that rest period has served its 
purpose.

“I don’t feel as fatigued as 

I did, per se, last year at this 
time,” Betsa said. “So I think 

that’s something positive to 
keep in mind. All those pitches 
I didn’t throw in the fall, I still 
have them to throw now.”

And 

Michigan 
will 

need 
every 

single 
one 
of 

those pitches.

With 

the 
offense 

struggling 
mightily 
in 

recent 
weeks, 

Betsa has been 
responsible 
for 

leading the team 

through some of its struggles. 
Against No. 20 Arizona State on 
March 2, Betsa had to nurse a 1-0 
lead for the majority of the game. 
The lack of run support didn’t faze 
her, as she carried the Wolverines 

to victory with a dominant 
16-strikeout complete game.

“Our pitching keeps us in the 

game,” Hutchins said. “That’s 
kinda their role.”

No one would have faulted 

Betsa for being content with 
the production that ranks her 
comfortably among the best 
pitchers in school history.

According to Hutchins, that’s 

just not who Megan Betsa is. 

“She 
is 
a 
perfectionist,” 

Hutchins said in her season-
opening press conference. “Her 
own worst enemy.”

But 
with 
a 
newfound 

combination 
of 
dominance 

and efficiency, it might be that 
perfectionism that has lifted 
an already-dominant pitcher to 
new heights early in her senior 
season.

Michigan opens Big Ten Tournament against Illinois

At West Virginia in 2005, John 

Beilein faced nearly the same 
situation he faces today.

After 

finishing 
the 

regular season 
18-9, 
the 

Mountaineers 
headed 
to 

Madison 
Square Garden 
as the Big East 
Tournament’s 
No. 8 seed in 
need of a victory 
or two to feel 
secure 
about 

their 
chances 

of 
making 

the 
NCAA 

Tournament.

West Virginia ended up doing 

more than picking up the wins it 
needed. After beating Providence 
in the first round, the Mountaineers 
followed that performance up 
by establishing and maintaining 
a 22-point halftime lead to take 
down the tournament’s No. 1 seed, 
Boston College. Beilein’s team 
then carried that momentum into 
the next day’s matchup against 
Villanova, where West Virginia 
escaped with a two-point win and 
was suddenly 40 minutes away 
from a Big East title.

The Mountaineers dropped 

the 
conference 
championship 

game to Syracuse, but their run 
to the final instilled a newfound 
confidence in Beilein’s squad that 
carried over to the Big Dance.

There, 
West 
Virginia 
first 

squeaked past Creighton at the 
buzzer in the first round, then 
upset No. 2 seed Wake Forest 
in double overtime and worked 
magic again to get past Texas 
Tech and into the Elite Eight.

The Mountaineers finally folded 

just short of the Final Four, when 
they blew a 20-point lead against 

Louisville and lost in overtime.

Just 
three 
weeks 
earlier, 

Beilein didn’t even know if 
his team was going to have 
the chance to play on college 
basketball’s biggest stage. But 
as it all unfolded, West Virginia 
became the main attraction of 
that year’s tournament.

And that’s the moment when 

Beilein first witnessed the magic 
of March.

“That series of events taught 

me anything can happen,” Beilein 
said. “We were just trying to make 
the NCAA Tournament, and the 
next thing you know, we’re ahead 
16 points on Louisville in the first 
half (of the Elite Eight), and don’t 
go to the Final Four. It was a great 
testimony of kids realizing, if you 

believe, anything can happen.”

Twelve seasons and seven 

NCAA Tournament appearances 
later, Beilein finds himself facing 
a 
very 
similar 

situation 
with 

Michigan.

The 

Wolverines enter 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
as 

the No. 8 seed, 
and while many 
believe Michigan 
to be in the field 
of 68, a win or two 
will certainly lock 
in a spot on Selection Sunday.

Based on the parity across the 

league throughout the regular 
season, this year’s edition of 

the Big Ten Tournament could 
be as wide open as ever. If the 
Wolverines 
can 
discover 
the 

same edge Beilein’s West Virginia 

team found, they 
could 
be 
the 

most 
dangerous 

team 
in 
the 

tournament.

“We’re 
trying 

to sell to them the 
magic that can 
happen in a run,” 
Beilein said. “It’s 
the best feeling. 
Something about 
the spring air and 

that the end of the season is near 
but you’re playing good basketball. 
You’re more excited to see your 
teammates. What a time March 

can be if you’re still playing.”

While Michigan’s goal and 

expectation is a championship, 
the Wolverines are focused on 
keeping their vision narrow and 
not overlooking what’s on the 
immediate horizon. Heading into 
the tournament, that challenge 
will come in the form of Illinois, 
a team Michigan saw twice in the 
regular season.

One of the Wolverines’ biggest 

obstacles will be their travel 
schedule. After their team plane 
slid off the runway in a take-off 
accident during a power outage 
Wednesday, they will now leave 
Ann Arbor for Washington at 
6 a.m. Thursday, just six hours 
before tip-off.

At the Verizon Center, a rubber 

match awaits them. Michigan and 
Illinois split two regular-season 
meetings, with each winning 
at home with the last meeting 
coming early in the conference 
season Jan. 21. In basketball time, 
that’s almost an eternity ago.

The “white-collar” comment 

Illinois center Maverick Morgan 
made following the first matchup 
has lost its sting, and both teams 
have developed new looks on 
both ends.

“The fact that we’ve played 

them twice, we know each other a 
little better,” Beilein said. “If you 
watch our last five games, their 
last five games, there are some 
similarities. But both teams have 
really evolved.”

Being that both teams are 

familiar with each other and 
know what’s at stake, Beilein kept 
his prediction of what to expect in 
the Verizon Center simple:

“Whoever makes shots and 

defends the best is going to win.”

But for Michigan, it may not 

be that easy. The hardest part of 
any tournament run is managing 
the game-to-game needs and 
ultimate goals. The Wolverines 
will 
have 
to 
establish 
that 

approach Thursday when they 
take on the Fighting Illini.

“We end practice everyday 

talking about being champions,” 
Beilein said. “We wanted to be 
champions of the (2K Classic). We 
were. We wanted to be (Big Ten) 
regular-season champions. But 
about two weeks ago, that wasn’t 
a possibility. Now there’s another 
one. That would be really special 
to spend those days there in D.C., 
to see the groundswell of support 
we have and win this thing.”

“But that’s the way you have to 

go into it now. Not with the idea 
that we just need to get another 
win. That’s part of it. I think 
they’re old enough to understand, 
‘Let’s focus on this one game at a 
time, but the real prize is to win 
this championship.’ ”

Michigan coach John Beilein’s team has been the No. 8 seed in each of the past three Big Ten Tournaments. This year, the Wolverines’ first opponent is Illinois.

“What a time 
March can be 
if you’re still 

playing.”

After splitting two regular-season meetings, Wolverines take on Fighting Illini at noon Thursday in Washington, D.C.

Wolverines to take 6 a.m. flight to 
Washington; noon tip-off still on

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team’s 
trip 
to 

the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 

in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
was 

jeopardized 
Wednesday 

when the team plane slid off 
the 
runway 
during 
takeoff 

at Willow Run Airport. The 
program 
confirmed 
in 
a 

statement that there were no 
significant injuries.

The team immediately got off 

the plane and spent the evening 
searching for an alternate travel 
plan. Around 10:30 Wednesday 
night, the program’s official 
Twitter account announced its 
new schedule: The Wolverines 
will now meet at Crisler at 6 
a.m. Thursday, take a bus to 
Metro Airport, depart at 7:30, 
arrive in Washington at 8:45 
and take a bus straight to the 
Verizon Center for a noon tip-
off against Illinois.

The schedule is a difficult 

way to start the tournament. 
If Michigan beats the Fighting 
Illini after a draining trip, 
it 
will 
play 
a 
well-rested 

Purdue team Friday at noon 
in the quarterfinals. Earlier 
Wednesday evening, a Big Ten 
official said that the conference 
would wait to see Michigan’s 
new 
itinerary 
to 
make 
a 

decision about changing the 
game time. The other three 
second-round games are on the 
schedule for the rest of the day 
at the Verizon Center. 

The 
Daily 
confirmed 

Wednesday 
night 
that 
the 

airport tower suffered a power 
outage — gusty winds affected 
the Ann Arbor area all day — but 
that the third-party dispatch 
still cleared for departure.

“After attempting to take 

off in high winds, takeoff 
was aborted and, after strong 

braking, the plane slide off (sic) 
runway,” a team spokesman 
said in a statement. “The plane 
sustained extensive damage but 
everyone on board was safely 
evacuated and is safe.”

Erica 
Donerson, 
manager 

of media relations of Wayne 
County Airport Authority, also 
confirmed and gave specifics 
about the incident in an email 
statement.

“Shortly before 3 p.m. today, 

a charter flight aborted takeoff 
at Willow Run Airport and went 
off the end of Runway 23L,” 
Donerson wrote. “The Airport 
Authority Public Safety and 
Operations teams responded. 
There 
were 

no injuries to 
the seven crew 
members 
and 

109 passengers, 
including 
members of the 
University 
of 

Michigan men’s 
basketball team. 
The 
MD83 

was 
operated 

by 
Ameristar 

Charters. As a 
result of this incident, Willow 
Run Airport remains closed at 
this time.”

At that time, in an interview 

with 
WXYZ-TV, 
Michigan 

coach John Beilein expressed 
in an interview his belief that 
flying Thursday is the right idea.

“Right now, I think the 

best decision is to wait until 
tomorrow and just get up early 
and go,” Beilein said. “I do not 
think it’s wise, with this wind, 
with our players where they 
are right now, our students, 
our staff, our cheerleaders, our 
band, probably not a good idea 
to go up again today.”

Several 
of 
the 
players, 

coaches, 
staff 
and 
other 

passengers 
tweeted 
positive 

notes afterward.

Recovering 
mentally 
and 

physically in time for the game, 
meanwhile, is a different story.

“It 
puts 
so 
much 
in 

perspective right now that 
everybody’s safe,” Beilein told 
WXYZ-TV. “We have a few 
people banged up a little bit, 
a few cuts, a few bruises, but 
other than that, everybody’s 
healthy, and it could have been 
much worse. The way the flight 
attendants, 
the 
pilots, 
the 

student-athletes, the students, 
the staff, conducted themselves 
was incredible. We were off that 
plane, going down those chutes, 
getting up on the wings, getting 

out 
of 
there. 

In 
a 
minute, 

it seemed like 
everybody 
got 

off that plane.”

According to 

other 
reports, 

the 
Federal 

Aviation 
Administration 
and 
National 

Transportation 
Safety 
Board 

are 
still 

investigating 
the 
wreck, 

including some of the team’s 
gear that is still on board. The 
coaches and players returned to 
Crisler Center after the accident 
and will now be pressed to 
make it to Washington before 
tip-off.

Still, 
those 
inside 
the 

program 
are 
grateful 
the 

damage was not worse.

“It’s only an airplane that was 

destroyed,” Beilein said. “No 
lives were destroyed in that. We 
gotta put things in perspective, 
and that game tomorrow has 
still a lot of meaning, but 
certainly our kids will look at it 
a lot differently, look at life a lot 
differently, after what we just 
experienced.”

Seniors prepare for home finale

A lot has changed since the 

seniors on the Michigan hockey 
team arrived in Ann Arbor 
before the start of the 2013-14 
season. The Wolverines entered 
that year ranked No. 10 in the 
country, 
and 
though 
their 

22-year 
NCAA 
Tournament 

streak had ended the year before, 
the nine freshmen who entered 
had aspirations of adding to the 
storied history of the program.

Now, after three of their 

classmates moved on to the NHL, 
just six seniors remain. And with 
this weekend marking the last 
regular-season 
games 
of 
the 

season, forwards Evan Allen, Alex 
Kile, Max Shuart, defensemen 
Nolan De Jong and Kevin Lohan 
and goaltender Zach Nagelvoort 
are facing their final opportunities 
to play at Yost Ice Arena.

“It’s exciting in a weird way,” 

Nagelvoort said. “I don’t really 
know the right word for it. It’s 
exciting that we have a chance 
to play Penn State … I think 
that’s really the focus in the 
room: playing Penn State on the 
weekend, not necessarily the 
Senior Night aspect of it. We’ll 
experience that after the game on 
Saturday. It’s not like a leading-
into-the-game kind of thing.

“I know I love playing here at 

Yost, so I’m going to just enjoy my 
last two times playing here. I’m 
sure I’ll be a mess after the game, 
but we’ll see when I get there.”

As Nagelvoort says, Michigan 

isn’t emphasizing Senior Night 
heavily 
at 
all. 
Instead, 
the 

Wolverines’ focus is on winning 
the 
games 
remaining 
and 

trying to rally some momentum 
before playing in the Big Ten 
Tournament.

“We don’t do much,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“We do (Senior Night) after the 
game, where some teams have a 
hurried presentation before the 
game, and we don’t do that. … We 
don’t make a big deal of it in the 
locker room as coaches. We’ve 
tried it in the past, and it doesn’t 
work. It doesn’t seem to relate. It 
relates more to the game.”

Things haven’t been easy 

for this particular senior class. 
Barring an unlikely win in the 
Big Ten Tournament, it will be 
just the third class in the last 26 
seasons to participate in only one 
NCAA Tournament collectively.

Add that to the departure 

of three of their classmates — 
JT Compher, Tyler Motte and 
Michael Downing — before this 
season, and the six-some has 
seen its fair share of struggles. 
But with all of that, they say it has 
just made them closer as a group.

“With 
those 
three 
guys 

signing in the offseason, it 
only made us, as a class, come 
closer,” Kile said. “… It’s going 
to be different next year, and it’s 
going to be hard to move on, but 
hopefully this last couple weeks 
of hockey can be memorable with 
those guys. And as we graduate 
and go (down) different paths, 
I definitely imagine all six of us 
keeping in touch.”

Added Allen: “The six of us 

remaining here, we all live in the 
same house or right next door to 
each other. We hang out every 
single night and every day. So 
we became really close. I mean, 
we do everything together. … It’s 
been really fun, and I’m going to 
miss it a lot.”

This season alone has been 

trying enough for the Wolverines 
and their seniors, as they are 
on track to have the program’s 
worst record in 30 years. But the 
individual players are used to 
dealing with tough situations. 
After all, when this season is over, 
their legacy may be their ability 
to fight through difficult times to 
make contributions on the ice.

“The one thing that’s happened 

to every one of them, they’ve all 
run into adversity,” Berenson 
said. “On the ice, they’ve all had 
trouble finding their way at one 
time or another. … And yet now 
they’re all contributing players, 
and they’re all graduating, and 
I’m glad they are.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Clayton 
Penrose-Whitmore 

was 12-years-old the first time 
he made the trek to Detroit 
to 
compete 
in 
the 
Sphinx 

Competition.

The Evanston, Ill. native, 

now 23, had heard about the 
annual 
strings 
competition 

— open to African-American 
and Latino players — from his 
violin instructor. Attending the 
Sphinx Competition served as 
a subtle revelation: Penrose-
Whitmore, who had become 
accustomed to being the only 
Black violin player among his 
peers, was now surrounded by 
people who looked like him and 
shared similar experiences.

“[There] was an unspoken 

understanding throughout the 
competition 
of 
community,” 

said 
Penrose-Whitmore 
in 

a 
phone 
interview. 
Nearly 

a decade after his Sphinx 
experience, he emerged from 
the 2014 competition with a 
second place prize in the Senior 
Division.

Annelle 
Gregory, 
like 

Penrose-Whitmore, first heard 
about Sphinx when she was 12 
or 13, through a family friend. 
Now, she’s 21. Over the years 
she came closer and closer to 
nabbing the top prize, until 
this year, when she was named 
champion.

“It was very rewarding for 

me to be named the winner 
this year,” she wrote in an 
email, “having been through 
every other placement in the 
competition previously.”

The 
Sphinx 
Organization, 

which runs the competition, is 
a Detroit-based organization 
dedicated to increasing the 
diversity 
of 
top-tier 
string 

players across the country. The 
inaugural competition was held 
in 1998, but the organization, the 
brainchild of Aaron Dworkin, 
then a student in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
(where he is now the dean), 
began earlier. Dworkin noticed 

an acute lack of diversity in 
the upper echelons of classical 
music performance — which 
would deter young minorities 
from taking up classical music 
— and decided to address it.

Afa 
Dworkin, 
now 
the 

Executive 
Director 
of 
the 

Sphinx 
Organization, 
first 

learned about Sphinx through 
Aaron, her then classmate.

“We spoke at length about 

why he felt something like this 
was necessary at the time,” she 
revealed over the phone, “and 
while it seemed laudable at the 
beginning, and while it seemed 
like a wonderful idea, there was 
nothing like actually meeting 
the first cohort of musicians 
and just recognizing the depth 
of talent and of need that was 
out there.”

Dworkin joined Sphinx in 

1999 
as 
the 
organization’s 

first intern, working on the 
programmatic team, developing 
the curriculum, scholarships, 
partnerships and the programs 
around the competition. The 
experience was illuminating.

“At the same time when I 

was recognizing how much 
talent there is in the pool of the 
musicians that are working,” 
she said. “I realized how little 
opportunity there is and how 
much work there is in order 
to connect the talent with the 
resources that are out there.”

When 
the 
Sphinx 

Competition began, Blacks and 
Latinos each comprised less 
than 1.5 percent of the talent 
in the top tiers of classical 
orchestra performance. Now, 
thanks in large part to Sphinx 
and programs for which it 
has served as inspiration and 
catalyst, that number is up to 4.6 
percent. But, Dworkin said, the 
inaugural competition revealed 
that the problems underlying 
the lack of diversity in the most 

prestigious 
orchestras 
ran 

deep. Students need to start 
playing at a very young age, 
and when schools only begin 
to teach music to 12-year-olds 

or 13-year-olds, they’ve already 
passed a critical point.

Danielle Belen, who won the 

2008 Competition and has gone 
on to serve on the competition’s 
jury and teach some of Sphinx’s 
programs, agrees. She considers 
herself 
lucky 
because 
her 

parents believed music was 

a critical component of early 
education. But she admits that 
her experience is not universal.

“Most parents are not geared 

that way,” she said. It is here 
where Sphinx can fill in the 
gap. Sphinx has been stitching 
classical music into the lives of 
African-American and Latino 
students at an earlier and 
earlier age where public schools 
are lacking.

Sphinx 
quickly 
began 
to 

develop preparatory programs 
for students after school and a 
“boot camp” over the summer. 
The programs combined access 
and education so that playing 
classical music was achievable 
to all students. Costs, too, were 
not lost on Sphinx, which has 
built 
numerous 
scholarships 

and grants over the decades and 
has awarded about $2.5 million 
to date.

Belen 
has 
been 
on 
the 

receiving 
end 
of 
Sphinx’s 

help. After her win, Belen was 
invited to perform with various 
orchestras, 
including 
the 

Cleveland Symphony, the San 
Francisco Symphony and the 
Boston Pops, among others.

“It was a whirlwind of a year,” 

she said in the phone interview. 
Belen 
has 
also 
won 
two 

different awards, amounting 
to $55,000, which she used to 
fund scholarships at a summer 
festival she started.

One 
of 
Sphinx’s 
larger 

mechanisms 
for 
financial 

support is the MPower Artist 
Grant, which is open to alumni 
of various Sphinx programs. 
The average award is $25,000, 
according to Sphinx’s website.

After her win, Belen began 

to focus on education, building 
connections and teaching at the 
Colburn School in Los Angeles, 

then in the Violin Department 
at the University of Michigan.

“Sphinx has always been 

there, always along the way, 
providing support,” she said.

Sphinx’s 
commitment 
to 

networking within the classical 
music community, an ever-
important role in the field, is 
manifested in a more recent 
development, Sphinx Connect 
— “our epicenter for artists and 
leaders in diversity,” Dworkin 
said — which helps players 
network 
to 
find 
openings 

in a field notorious for its 
competition for opportunities. 
At 
the 
center 
of 
Sphinx 

Connect is a yearly convention 
for musicians. This past year, 
over 
500 
people 
attended 

from across the world. Sphinx 
Connect continues throughout 
the year by hosting webinars, 
contributing 
to 
a 
mentor 

network that serves as a “true 
conduit” for rising musicians 
to an industry increasingly 
attuned to the necessity of 
inclusion.

The 
Sphinx 
Organization 

also runs a litany of educational 
programs. 
One 
is 
Sphinx 

Overture, which provides free 
introductory lessons to Detroit 
and Flint students. The Sphinx 
Performance Academy is a full-
scholarship summer program 

for solo instrumentalists to 
hone their craft. Not to be 
limited by geography, Classical 
Connections assists teachers in 
incorporating classical music 
into 
classrooms 
across 
the 

country.

As the Sphinx Competition 

approaches its 20th birthday, 
Dworkin looked back at the 
organization’s progress.

“There’s 
been 
a 

transformative 
impact,” 
she 

said, not only indicated by the 
experiences of musicians the 
organization has affected. “But 
also the field being so much more 
responsive and connected” to 
the organization’s work. When 
orchestras and institutions try 
to confront their own lack of 
diversity, Sphinx often serves 
as an exemplary model.

Sphinx’s direct impact is also

Approaching its 20th anniversary, 
Sphinx Organization takes stock

Clayton Penrose-
Whitmore was 
12-years-old the 
first time he made 
the trek to Detroit 

to compete 
in the Sphinx 
Competition.

Sphinx quickly 
began to develop 

preparatory 
programs for 
students after 

school and a “boot 

camp” over the 

summer

final word in a skeptic’s debate 
over 
whether 
exceptional 

talent existed in enough Latino 
and African-American players 
to justify the program. That 
doubt, abundantly disproven 
at this point, had cast a shadow 
over Sphinx as it began, but 
by now concerns have largely 
dissipated.

“[Sphinx participants] have 

proven 
that 
inclusion 
does 

not mean any sacrifice on the 
excellent front … it can exist 
in tandem and be celebrated,” 
Dworkin said.

Belen 
agreed. 
When 
she 

performed with the Sphinx 
Virtuosi, 
an 
orchestra 

comprised 
of 
competition 

alumni, she noted, “There are 
absolutely no excuses or special 
standards” 
because 
of 
the 

orchestra’s racial makeup. On 
the contrary, she said, “[there’s] 
an incredibly high level of 
musicianship.”

For Belen, Sphinx’s 20th year 

represents a critical juncture in 
the organization’s success.

“As an educator, I am seeing 

that there are young people who 
have now grown up in a world 
where there has always been a 
Sphinx Organization,” she said. 
Progress in the field is slow, 
she admits, because players 
start early but only reach the 
pinnacles much later, perhaps 
15 or 20 years in the future.

“We’re 
seeing 
an 
entire 

new generation of kids being 
influenced 
by 
this,” 
Belen 

said. All this progress amounts 
to a major change in the 
classical music community’s 
demographics.

“You 
want 
to 
look 
at 

musicians 
on 
stage 
that 

reflect the musicians of the 
community,” 
Belen 
added. 

“That’s the goal and it’s a long 
process because it has to start 
deep down, with little kids, and 
giving opportunities.”

Gregory 
named 
that 

demographic 
change 
as 

a 
particularly 
important 

development.

“Sphinx has opened up minds 

to the fact that musicians of 
color can not only play classical 
music, but that we can be 
extremely successful at it,” she 
wrote,

Still, there’s work to be done. 

Dworkin noticed a persistent 
and acute lack of diversity that 
remains in America’s academic 
music circles — conservatories 
and music schools. To take 
diversity seriously, she said, 
these 
institutions 
must 
go 

beyond 
supporting 
Sphinx; 

they need to follow its lead. For 
Dworkin, a lack of diversity is 
an existential crisis for classical 
music. Without making sure 
top tier classical musicians 

reflect the population as a 
whole, “our field stands to feel 
and become irrelevant and 
therefore suffer and eventually 
become extinct,” she said. 

Gregory finds meaning in 

the music she plays not just 
through the notes, but the 
context — playing with friends. 
“Performing 
[the 
Sibelius 

Violin Concerto, the required 
repertoire for the 2017 finals] 

with the Sphinx Symphony 
Orchestra was a wonderful 
experience that I will always 
remember,” she wrote, “not just 
because I won but because I 
know many of the members on 
a first-name basis and it was 
like giving a concert with my 
friends.”

Like 
Gregory, 
Penrose-

Whitmore’s history with the 
Sphinx Competition has been 
shaped by the relationships he’s 
developed over the years. He 
was surprised the first time he 
participated in the competition.

“It felt more like a family 

reunion than a competition. 
It was great,” he said. Music 
competitions of the sort are 
typically 
extra 
competitive, 

leaving little room for bonding 
and socializing. But Sphinx was 
different.

“I made a lot of friends that 

I still have. It was just a great 
vibe over all,” Clayton said.

Belen 
shared 
a 
similar 

experience 
at 
her 
first 

competition. “It didn’t feel 
like a competition,” she said. 
“It felt like a family.” They call 
it “la Sphinx familia,” Belen 
said, and it’s clear why. The 
Sphinx Competition extends 
far beyond the competition 
itself. 
Scholarships, 
master 

classes and concerts are open 
to a larger swath of competitors 
than the elite few who advance 
to the final rounds. In the 
mean time, competitors learn 
about collaboration and work 
with each other in creative 
situations. 
Experience 
as 

pedagogy reigns supreme as 
competitors bask in a diverse 
classical music cornucopia.

As Penrose-Whitmore grew 

up, Sphinx’s magic didn’t fade. 
“A lot of times over the years 
I’ve gone back to the Sphinx 
Competition 
to 
participate 

in the orchestra, or compete 
again, and honestly I look 
forward to just going back,” he 
said, “not to compete but just to 
see everyone, see the old friends 
that I’ve made, and really have 
that sense of community there.”

La Sphinx familia extends 

beyond 
pleasantries 
at 
the 

competition. Belen said many 
Sphinx alumni’s careers have 
progressed with Sphinx very 
much in the background or 
foreground. Opportunities have 
been opened and connections 
have been made through the 
organization’s work.

And for some, Sphinx has 

provided 
much 
more 
than 

musical opportunities. The first 
violinist and the violist of the 
Catalyst Quartet, an ensemble 
of Sphinx Competition alumni, 
are getting married.

The Sphinx 
Organization 

also runs a litany 

of educational 

programs

“Sphinx has 

opened up minds 

to the fact that 

musicians of color 
can not only play 
classical music, 
but that we can 
be extremely 

successful at it”

“It felt more 
like a family 

reunion than a 
competition. It 

was great”

The Sphinx 

Organization is 
a Detroit-based 

organization 
dedicated to 
increasing the 
diversity of top-
tier string players 
across the country

The website of 2016 Penny 

Stamps graduate, multimedia 
artist and community activist 
Alexa 
Borromeo 
reads, 

“HOUSTON 
MADE. 
NOT 

AFRAID” in big, white block 
letters 
against 
an 
abstract 

backdrop that suggests fast 
horizontal movements across 
the screen, maybe taken from 
a train or or a fast-moving car.

“Houston 
has 
almost 

everything to do with why 
I do what I do … it’s a very 
culturally and racially diverse 
city,” said Borromeo in a phone 
interview.

Growing up in such a diverse 

community allowed for her to 
see race in a much less divisive 
way, 
leading 
to 
a 
certain 

culture shock upon her arrival 
to the University at the salient 
disparity 
between 
white 

people and people of color.

For 
example, 
a 
video 

installation 
titled 
“stay 

out of the sun: a colonized 
consciousness” presents the 
artist’s body as it exists within 
the post-colonial sphere and 
how the pressures of and 
assimilation bear down upon 
it. The artist bares her nude 

body in a public video and 
photo installation in which 
she engages in rituals such 
as placing clothespins on the 
bridge of her nose and covering 
her 
skin 
in 
white 
paint. 

Borromeo’s work consists of 
mainly photography, video and 
public art; all highly narrative 
in form — sharing her own 
stories as well as the stories of 
others in ways that challenge 
the status quo.

Much of the art reveals urban 

backdrops. A woman in a towel 

moves down a sidewalk as a bus 
teeters a little too close to the 
curb, obscuring her from view 
momentarily. A child sits on 
his caregiver’s lap on a subway 
in black and white, staring 
straight into the camera. A 
Chicago construction worker 
peers up at his coworker from 
inside a pothole.

Borromeo highlighted the 

importance of her Houston, 
TX upbringing in creating 
socially-engaged art.

While 
in 
high 
school, 

Borromeo 
identified 
the 

opportunity to connect interest 
in both community action and 
art.

“I saw the opportunity to 

bridge the two: my desire to 
help others and my desire to 
create art,” she said. 

One 
project 
Borromeo 

created was a film in which 
young adults reflect on early 
memories of when they first 
became aware of how their 
social identities made them 
somehow “different,” the face 
of each speaker obscured by a 
childhood photo. 

At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, Borromeo became 
involved in multiple pursuits 
that sought to explore the ways 
in which art could be used 
to 
strengthen 
communities 

and spark social change. She 
served as the Senior Opinion 
Video Editor at The Michigan 
Daily in 2014-15 and became 
involved with the Black and 
Asian Coalition on Campus.

Although Borromeo knew 

early on that she wanted 
to 
create 
socially-engaged 

art, she recognized her own 
process of self-exploration and 
returning to her own roots and 
identities as crucial steps in 
developing an activist/artist 
persona. During her senior 
year, Borromeo returned to 
Houston to examine her roots, 
collecting 
sound 
material 

from her past that culminated 
in a video installation at the 
Duderstadt Center.

“It was a good way to get me 

in the mode to really create 
more 
socially-engaged 
art 

because I had some stuff I 
needed to express individually 
first,” Borromeo said.

She also spoke to her own 

identities as a Filipina and a 
person of color as they affect 
her 
process 
and 
artistic 

interest.

“Being Filipina, which is 

a colonized culture and a 
very 
Americanized 
culture, 

sometimes Filipinos have a 
somewhat 
relatable 
quality 

to them because we’re so 

Americanized so sometimes 
Filipinos can fit into a lot of 
different ethnic groups easily,” 
she said.

She 
also 
identified 

challenges 
of 
reconciling 

the sometimes traditional or 
conservative 
limitations 
of 

Filipina culture as it brushes 
up 
against 
the 
sometimes 

provocative or explicit nature 
of her art. She identified 
admiration for other Filipina 
artists for venturing into that 
territory, 
despite 
societal 

expectations or norms. 

“It’s hard as a Filipina 

woman and artist to publicize 
the it the way I want to 
publicize it sometimes. That’s 
still something I’m navigating,” 
she added. 

Such 
acute 
observance 

and passion for combatting 
structural racism and other 
injustices, 
inspires 
almost 

all 
of 
Borromeo’s 
work. 

She 
became 
involved 
with 

a program in 2014 called 
Summer Youth Dialogues, in 
which she facilitated dialogues 
on race and ethnicity — an 
involvement 
that 
almost 

seemed 
to 
foreshadow 
the 

work she does currently.

Borromeo divides her days 

between Detroit and Ypsilanti. 
In Detroit she works with 
Focus:

organization in collaboration 
with AmeriCorps and Public 
Allies that seeks to put in place

TEDx and the pursuit of 
meaningful social change

About a year ago, on a 

beautiful morning, I sat outside 
on a deck. In my hand I had a 
mug of coffee, and as I sat I was 
enjoying the way the light wind 
tugged at my hair and snatched 
little rising lines of steam 
from the coffee. The birds 
chirped from the treeline in 
the distance. Across from me, 
my father reclined in a chair. 
We were discussing gardens: 
What plants we would want, 
why, where they would go — he 
wanted flowers, I vegetables. 
He wanted for the beauty; I 
wanted for the use. “It’s odd,” 
he said. “You of all people, an 
artist, I would think would 
appreciate things independent 
from 
their 
use.” 
And, 

innocuous as that comment 
is, it touched upon one of my 
central anxieties: What is the 
use of doing art in a fractured 
world?

***

By nature I am a rather 

pessimistic person. As long 
as I can remember, I have 
viewed the chance of success 
(no matter what the subject) 
with wary eyes. Whenever the 
clouds part to reveal a glorious 
sunburst, I squint and wonder 
what pitfall I’m missing. I 
have faith in very little other 
than the inevitability of decay. 
Paradoxically, I also get swept 
up by broad, romantic ideas 
about 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 

utopian future; I’m occasionally 
overcome 
with 
grandiose 

visions of total equilibrium 
and ample bounties, perfect 
worlds wrought with human 
hands, all of which I think is 
— theoretically — attainable. It 
just won’t happen. In essence, I 
believe that Elysium exists but 
that we’ll never reach it.

Enter TED talks: It shouldn’t 

come as a surprise that the 
entire concept is supremely 
uncomfortable to me. I simply 
don’t know what to think of it. 
On the one hand, having a place 
to share ideas and visions for a 
better world with the general 
public kindles an enticing spark 
of hope within my mind, a hope 
that we might yet do something 
to save ourselves and our 
planet from oblivion — at least 
for a little while longer. On the 
other, I sometimes wonder if 
TED isn’t just a collection of 
self-congratulatory 
pseudo-

intellectual liberal types who 
commend themselves for doing 
little more than acknowledging 
that the world has problems 
(which, granted, is probably an 
unnecessarily acerbic and not-
wholly-accurate critique, but 
there it is). I sometimes wonder 
if it’s not a great example of the 
sort of elite liberal smugness 
that has been so discussed 
over the past year. These two 
conflicting conceptions of TED 
have been in competition more 
or less since the first time I saw 
some lectures posted online 
years ago. When I first came 
to the University, the annual 

conference hosted on campus 
reawakened these ideas.

When I first conceived of 

writing about the University 
of Michigan TEDx conference, 
I envisioned something like 
this: I would walk into the 
conference, notebook in hand, 
wry smile suspended on my 
face, keenly observing the swirl 
of bodies flowing in currents 
around me, picking up snippets 
of enthusiastic conversation as 
I occasionally scribbled down 
some witty observation. I would 
sit quietly in the audience 
listening half-attentively to the 
lectures, making intermittent 
notes of insightful comments I 
would tuck away for later use. 
At the end of the presentations 
I would clap dutifully, pack up 
my things and go home. A week 
later I would have produced a 
commentary on my experience 
that would be simultaneously 
thought-provoking and funny, 
filled with clever observations, 
dry wit and telling anecdotes. I 
would be David Foster Wallace 
on a cruise ship, Hunter S. 
Thompson writing an obituary.

That was one year ago. A 

lot has happened in the world 
since then, and the inclination 
of my thoughts has turned dark 
concurrent with public events. 
I want us to do something to 
improve our world or mitigate 
the fallout from recent events, 
but more and more it seems as 
if our efforts yield nothing but 
an elongated death spiral. So, 
inevitably this article is going 
to end up very different from 
what I might have written 
even just a few months ago. 

In the past few weeks, I’ve sat 
down to write it maybe a dozen 
times, but each time I’ve found 
my ideas are haunted by the 
spectre of everything that’s 
been going on. By now I’ve just 
accepted that.

I brought the notebook at 

least.

This year’s TEDx Conference 

(at 
this 
point 
it’s 
worth 

point out that the University 
conferences are TEDx events, 
which means that they are 
organized 
independently 

from TED Conferences, LLC) 
was about a month ago now, 
and it was the first time I had 
attended an event of that sort. 
The conference was held at 
the Power Center on Fletcher 
Street, 
which 
is 
probably 

familiar to most Ann Arborites 
as 
that 
imposing 
concrete 

building with an abundance of 
windows and vaguely modernist 
architectural 
aesthetic. 
The 

first thing I noticed when I 
entered the building was the 
excited, high-decibel chatter 
bouncing around the concrete 
walls. The second thing was 
the large, firetruck red “TED” 
sign / sculpture, just in case 
there was any confusion about 

what was going on. People 
posed dramatically with this, 
capturing a piece of visual 
memorabilia with a little tap of 
their thumb.

The festivities surrounding 

TED began long before the 
first talk was given. In the 
lobby, tables and stands were 
assembled in a manner that 
vaguely 
resembled 
the 
air 

of a scaled-down, less weird 
carnival — imagine the energy 
without 
the 
strangeness. 

Refreshments were provided, 
courtesy of Avalon Pastries 
and 
RoosRoast 
Coffee. 
A 

heat-sensitive 
video 
camera 

displayed a real-time image 
of 
passers-by 
in 
vivid, 

psychedelic color. Along one 
wall was something called a 
“Dream Line,” where people 
would write an aspiration on a 
notecard before hanging it from 
a line already weighed down 
by dozens of other notecards, 
little pithy phrases like “turn 
compassion into action” or 
the standard-fare American-
Dream-style “get a job with a 
six-figure salary.” Not really 
my kind of thing, but after 
several friendly proddings by 
an eager-looking volunteer in 
a red TED shirt, I scribbled 
something down and left it. My 
favorite feature by far was the 
stand run by Literati, which 
contained a selection of books 
picked out by the featured 
speakers — there were even a 
few titles that are on my own 
to-read list. The atmosphere 
of the whole thing was that of 
optimistic pageantry.

The talks began after the 

audience — all 1,300 people 
— finished filing into the 
auditorium 
of 
the 
Power 

Center. After the usual we’re-
pleased-welcome-you standard 
introduction stuff, the first 
speaker strode onto the stage. 
The ASL interpreter stood 
poised at the edge of the 
platform, waiting for speech.

Koen Vanmechelen looks like 

a storm. His dark eyes and wild, 
graying hair perfectly embody 
the image of the pioneering 
artist — which is good, because 
that’s what he is. A close-up 
image of a chicken flashed 
onto the projection screen. The 
Belgian spoke.

“This is not a chicken,” he 

said. I honestly didn’t expect 
that.

Vanmechelen 
went 
on 

to 
discuss 
his 
years-long 

conceptual art project, the 
Cosmopolitan Chicken Project, 
explaining in imperfect but 
intelligent English the ways 
in which he tries to unify our 
diverse 
world 
through 
his 

art, which is a “metaphor.” 
Through 
the 
breeding 
of 

various types of chickens, he 
works to show the diversity and 
interdependence of humanity 
with itself and the natural 
world. Strange as it sounds, 
at the end of his presentation 
(which 
was 
punctuated 
by 

little “you know(s),” a habitual 
exclamation that seemed to 
both thrown-away placeholder 
and 
genuinely 
inquisitive, 

gently emphatic plea), I felt I

Who is this narrator? What is the accent? I’m so scared. The way he said 

“firing squad” just made me want to cry. Eerie. The death penalty beds. I’m going to cry. This 
man, Hank, has been on death row for 17 years and he’s still cracking jokes. I’m just going to 
leave this here: So many things that the police does are illegal. Hank looks so tired. His arms 
are chubby 
but his cheeks are hollow. Still terrified of this narrator’s tone; 

it is CHILLING. Here’s Hank’s story: This man was 

accused of triple homicide of his girlfriend and her 

two children. Though he denies the crime to this 

day, he was sentenced to death row. With 20 

minutes of his execution, in the “death house,” 

Hank said his last goodbyes, and then he was 

saved. “The only thing was that they didn’t 
kill me.” He was pardoned by the Supreme 
Court just moments before his schedule 
execution. Now, Hank is back on death 
row. His holding cell is five steps away 
from the gurney. Nothing about this is 
right. They feed these inmates around 
the clock. “Time really has no meaning 
in here.” Nobody washes the prison 
windows; inmates can’t receive a clear 
view of the outside world, neither literally 
nor figuratively. I cannot go into detail here 

without breaking down, and I have no relation 

to the issue of death row aside from watching 

this show right now. I feel sick. Outsiders are 

not allowed to view the inner areas of death row 

housing. Hank describes them as a house of “human 

bondage and human suffering. A bad place.” Interesting 

take: 
A chef at death row commissioned to cook people’s last-ever meals. 

Can you imagine? Cooking meals for criminals awaiting a planned execution. How anyone 
eats just minutes before their certain death is beyond my comprehension. Hank is smart. I feel 
nauseous and I haven’t seen any blood.

Werner Herzog’s 
‘On Death Row’

in this series, three daily arts 

writers in varying states of mind 

do the same activity and write 

about it.

Oh my god, why is my spell check correcting into French. Moving on. For posterity: I feel 

very strange. Sort of tingly, really. Ah, it is begining now. Dramatic string music and a 

pan shot of a prison table with Bibles. This surely portents much. Werner Hertz-

og is talking now, and I have to listen. He has such a grave, dramatic voice 

— I am bound to heed to it. The death-row inmate seems like such a 

congenial fellow, until he starts talking about, like, the fact that 

he was convicted of tripple homicide. “How familiar are 

you with the details of the execution?” Herzog to 

DRI — jesus christ Werner, you don’t go gently 

do you? “Could that be more Ameri-

can?” asked Tess about the last meal 

of a hamburger and fries, “much like 

the death penalty” thought I. (To be read 

with thick Bavarian accent): “God, this is really 

depressing. Why does this exist (re: the death pen-

alty)?” (Also, see “Get it Right: Privatize Executions” by 

Michigan’s own Arthur Miller.) “His cheeks are really hollow” 

says the Style editor. “No shit,” says someone in the back of my 

cerebrum. It is interesting that the inmate’s most vivid descriptions are 

about food. Why is someone vacuming right now? “Yeah I see your point” 

The concept of being led to death on a timeline is excruciating to me. To see the 

specter of death land on your bedside, to measure each second until that great abyss 

of unknowability is perhaps the most terrifiying thing after the abyss in the first place 

“This guy is still on death row” says buzzed. “This show was five years ago” “Is his name 

Frank?” says Tess “Hank says” buzzed. “What is going on with this family” Herzog after learn-
ing the man’s son is charged with kidnapping. (update, he was later aquitted) Tbh I should stop 
just quoting things I hear. A journalist is now describing the staggering wounded walk of a 
murder victim. This really is a downer. There was just a minute of silence on the episode. very 
effecrive use of abscene “I don’t have a problem with the death penalty” says TV journalist. 
“fuck journalists” says a not-TV journalist This inmate just made a reference to medieval his-
tory. Templars “Skinner tends to get lost in obscure historical tales” Herzog This is probably 
too long now. I’ll stop. He has a very distictive nervous laugh

watching rn. wenrer herzog’s thick and distinct german 

accent has been haunting most of my night as he pries into 

the nitty gritty details of the squalor death row inmates 

face. this man, hank, just ruminated over how he went 

through a last meal and his last rites and prepared for his 
eventual death until a judge issued him a stay on his case 

20 minutes before his execution ?? wtf ?? this was a terrible 

idea wow

mature. 
Her 

outreach 
also 
involves 

starting art clubs at schools 
where funding or access to 
the arts may be limited.

“I’ve gotten what I’ve 

learned 
through 
college 

and through art school and 
now I’m giving it back to 
the community,” Borromeo 
said. 

From Borromeo’s studio 

in 
Ypsilanti 
she 
works 

on 
other 
independent 

and 
collaborative 
art 

projects. She was recently 
featured in the “Vagina 
Show” 
in 
Detroit, 
an 

exhibition 
centered 

around 
intersectionality, 

or the way social identities 
interact and open up space 
for 
multidimensional 

dialogue 
about 
various 

systems of oppression and 
discrimination. 
Borromeo 

is also involved in the 
curating of an anti-Trump 
show in Detroit.

Additionally, 
she 

collaborates 
with 

community activists groups 
in 
Detroit, 
like 
Detroit 

Independent 
Freedom 

Schools, a movement that 
offers 
supplementary 

weekend 
education 
by 

volunteer 
teachers 
to 

aid those Detroit Public 
Schools 
students 
who 

struggle. She is also a 
member of the Detroiters’ 
Resistance to Trump and 

DMJ studio, a group of 
women artists who use art 
to tell stories of those who 
live in Detroit and bring art 
to non-traditional spaces 
and neighborhoods.

However, 
the 
project 

that seems to be most 
reflective 
of 
Borromeo’s 

artistic 
journey 
is 
one 

which seeks to provide a 
cultural exchange between 
Houston and Detroit. She 
co-founded 
a 
show 
in 

Houston last year called 
“Art to Art” that showcased 
the fashion, hip-hop and 
art of local artists, and she 
hopes to foster a cultural 
exchange between the two 

cities, ideally having people 
from Detroit visit Houston 
and vice versa.

Borromeo 
highlights 

interdisciplinary 
and 

intersectionality 
at 
the 

heart of her work. Such a 
multidimensional approach 
is clear in the work of 
the artists and activists 
she admires. She spoke 
of Antonio Cosme, who 
weaves 
his 
public 
and 

street art with community 
organizing, and of Adrian 
Piper, who Borromeo said 
was, “basically everything 
I 
want 
to 
be 
ever,” 

expressing 
admiration 

for Piper’s strength as an 
artist, philosopher and her 
exploration and expression 
of what it means to be a 
light-skinned black woman.

Borromeo views art as a 

way of educating, informing 
and inspiring those who 
may not otherwise have the 
access to such knowledge, 
touching on the universal 
quality of what she does. 
She suggested that art was 
maybe more “digestible” 
to some than say, reading a 
newspaper.

“It’s 
a 
very 
special 

situation to be an artist, 
especially during this time 
because not everyone has 
the capacity to read the 
newspaper, 
maybe 
not 

everyone knows how to read. 
But art — but everyone kind 
of 
understands 
imagery 

— 
understands 
what 
a 

sound 
is, 
understands 

what movement is and so 
it can strike people in an 
emotional way that’s very 
different than just cut-and-
dry stuff. I think artists 
just have a very strong role 
to play, especially in just 
empowering other people.”

had 
both 
enjoyed 
and 

learned from it — though 
I 
had 
been 
expecting 

this, as it isn’t the first 
time I have encountered 
Vanmechelen’s work, and 
have a CCP poster to prove 
it.

Most of the remaining 

speakers capably presented 
their ideas, though at a 
month’s remove I would 
have difficulty telling you 
what they all spoke on 
without my notes. I won’t 
touch on everyone here 
(and soon enough you’ll 
be able to watch the talks 
yourself online), but I will 
mention a few moments 
which I feel are pertinent 
to my point. The artist 
Sophia Brueckner, now an 
Art and Design assistant 
professor, 
perhaps 

indirectly 
addressed 

the principal concern at 
the heart of this piece: 
The place of optimism. 
“Critical optimism” was 
the 
way 
she 
described 

her approach (in her case, 
to the potential impact 
of new technologies), a 
midway 
between 
“pure 

optimism” and “everything 
is terrible.” And perhaps 
that is the most healthy 
way to view things. But for 
myself, I fear that far too 
often optimism takes the 
place of action, that our 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 

world can be sated through 
a simple, cheery belief that 
things will all work out — 
the problem lies in that, 
like trying to sate a physical 
hunger with pure glucose, 
this 
solution 
essentially 

has no substance.

One 
of 
my 
principal 

issues with TED, I suppose, 
is that it gives a smattering 
of anodyne verbal offerings 
while 
rarely 
translating 

words 
into 
tangible 

gains. Its audiences are 
full of essentially well-

meaning people who more 
than likely will never do 
anything about the very real 
problems discussed (and I 
do not exclude myself from 
this group; and of course 
there are obviously others 
in any given TED audience 
who I would exclude, but 
here I speak generally). 

The 
conference’s 
theme 

was 
“Dreamer’s 
and 

Disrupters,” 
and 
my 

concern is that the former 
perhaps overbore the latter 
to an unhealthy degree. 
While a TED conference 
indulges in the dopamine 
rush of what seems to me 
an extreme, often irrational 
optimism, 
I’m 
unable 

to overcome the feeling 
that the whole of our 
civilization is careening 
towards some grisly wreck. 
The 
tragedy 
is 
greater 

because I feel that this 
wreck is probably avertable 
if we simple managed to 
rouse ourselves to action. 
But maybe it’s not, and 
maybe all that will be left 
one day of this pleasant 
little jaunt around the park 
of liberal democracy are the 
steel skeletons that were 
once our cities, skyscraper 
tombstones 
whistling 

in the wind. Oh well. Of 
course, this is probably a 
hyperbolic thing to wonder 
— I do that sometimes. But 
I’m not the first to think it, 
and I won’t be the last, and 
someday one of us is bound 
to be right.

The 
inadequacy 
of 

mere talk turned out to be 
perhaps my biggest take-
away from the conference, 
but this isn’t to say that the 
feeling is merited equally 
by all the presenters. Many 
of the speakers do engage in 
exactly the sort of concrete, 
tangible altering of the 
world that I’m advocating. 
Scott Matzka has become 
an ALS advocate. Erika 
Newman is trying to cure 
cancer. Abdul El-Sayed is 
the Health Commissioner 
for the city of Detroit — a 
few days after the talk the 
32-year-old announced his 
candidacy 
for 
governor. 

All of these people do 
real 
work 
to 
improve 

the world. But one of the 
things they all have in 
common is they strive to 
use 
science 
to 
address 

material issues. For the 
artists of the conference, 
the impact they can have 
was far less obvious, and 
far more abstract — all 
of which raises the much 
larger question of art’s role 
in changing the world. In 
what ways, in the light of 
all the wrong that exists, 
can what we do as artists 
be ultimately meaningful? 
I don’t have the answer. But 
what I do know is this: We 
have to believe art means 
something. The alternative 
is negation and despair.

COURTESY OF CANTERBURY HOUSE

A Night For Us: Love & 
activism at Canterbury

Ann Arbor’s own Canterbury House fashions itself as an 
earnest refuge and community for University music students

There’s a small episcopal 

church that resides on East 
Huron Street that few remark 
upon when passing it. It goes 
unnoticed for the most part, 
its plain demeanor disguising 
itself within the rows and rows 
of college residences. But this 
church, strangely enough, has 
a been a home for generations 
of students passing through the 
University of Michigan, where 
jazz 
students 
and 
regional 

bands alike have gathered to 
perform, celebrate, study and — 
most importantly — eat.

Canterbury House has seen 

the likes of Neil Young and Janis 
Joplin grace its interior since 
its inception over fifty years 
ago, and today features musical 
series 
highlighting 
artists 

from 
within 
the 
university 

and 
beyond. 
But 
according 

to School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance sophomore Alexis 
Lombre, something was still 

missing from Canterbury and 
from the University as a whole 
at the beginning of the year: 
community. A community for 
artists of color and a community 
to break down the academic 
barriers of SMTD — this is what 
Lombre strived to create, and 
what she has only started to this 
year.

“Each program within the 

school is kind of segregated; 
actors hang with actors; jazz 
musicians hang with the jazz 
musicians; vocalists spend time 
with vocalists,” Lombre said in 
a phone interview. “I wanted 
a space where we could bring 
everyone together; you could 
throw some creative writers in 
there, just have some people of 
color who just like the arts, and 
have a community.”

But to create this community, 

she had to start somewhere. 
After 
the 
chaplain 
of 
the 

episcopal center offered up 
the space to Lombre this past 
fall, she took advantage of it 
and put on the first “A Night 
for Us: Colorful Soul.” For the 
first 
two 
months, 
however, 

participation 
was 
sparse. 

She paid for expenses out of 
pocket and negotiated student 
performances through her own 
means.

And then it took off. Come 

November, 
participation 

doubled and from the Lombre’s 
desire for a community for 
artists of color at the University 
sprang the group Artists of 
Color in Ann Arbor. Both a way 
to receive money and bolster the 
impact of the series, this group 
has only begun to foster the 

much needed support network 
between artists of color at 
the University, a community 
Lombre found noticeably absent 
her freshman year.

“It’s a different type of 

attitude that I’d like to see here in 
Ann Arbor, a place where people 
really have a place for artists of 
color to hangout and for people 
of color to just be themselves,” 
Lombre said. “Because there 
are a lot of initiatives that are 
kind of … stocky. There’s a room 
with lighting that’s awkward 
because it still feels like I’m in 
school, and nobody wants that. 
Nobody actually wants to hang 
out at school. You want to go out 
somewhere.”

But the music is only one part 

of the soul. The food is the other, 
vital part.

“That’s why we always have 

soul food there; soul food 
just brings a different type of 
attitude instead of having plates 
of cheese and crackers and 
shrimp cocktails,” she said.

It’s 
this 
transformation 

from stocky to soulful, tense 
to chill that creates the unique 
atmosphere 
of 
Lombre’s 

series. Community, especially 
a welcoming one, invites a 
kind 
of 
electric 
relaxation 

between friends and strangers 
alike. 
Which 
is 
Lombre’s 

goal ultimately — to foster an 
environment 
that 
supports 

artists and people of color 
through music, food and groove.

“I think this event is a very 

organic and authentic way for 
people who haven’t experienced 
culture of people of color to 
really experience it within their 
own comfort zone,” Lombre 
continued.

And in its most fundamental 

sense, 
Lombre’s 
series 

champions 
simultaneous 

activism and celebration. It is 
meant to inspire and facilitate 
a molding of divisions on our 
campus and others. Because 
even though this event is young, 
a sprouting bud among the 
many campaigns and initiatives 
to arise on campus since the 
election, it is also boundless 
with Lombre at its stern.

“I am not the type of person 

who wants to keep anything 
small,” Lombre said. “I’m a 
dreamer, and I would love to see 
it grow. Eventually one of my 
dreams is to have it as a campus 
college tour where different 
campuses get ‘A Night for Us.’”

It’s an ambitious plan, but 

one with potential. Campus has 
its divisions, as do many others, 
but this community is one step 
in the right direction towards 
healing them. While her vision 
for this community is one rooted 
in celebration and support for 
artists and people of color on 
campus, it is also meant to heal.

“The way I want to bring the 

political (divisions) together is 
not in a harsh, protesting type 
of way because there’s a lot of 
people doing that. My way is to 
basically invite everyone into 
your home and treat them really 
well to help them realize that 
people of color are welcoming,” 
Lombre added. “We should just 
care about each other, and that 
will change things.”

And 
Lombre, 
along 
with 

her fellow students helping to 

grow the community, is caring. 
Artists of Color in Ann Arbor 
— the organization that both 
sprung from this series and 
allows it to subsist — has grown 
since its inception in November. 
Partnering with the art and 
social 
justice 
organization 

Redefine, areas of Greek Life 
and several other organizations, 
ACAA supports the series, but 
the series is only the beginning.

“At the bare minimum, at the 

least by the time I graduate, 
folks of color and artists of color 
will know that they have a home 
at the University of Michigan. 
That’s the bare minimum,” 
Lombre said.

But the bare minimum is just 

that — bare. A community and 
a series like this has room to 
grow and the power to actively 
change the social climate on 
campus, a climate born more 
from fear of the unfamiliar than 
from anything else. Because, as 

Lombre explained, the idea for 
this series was born from anger 
and frustration. But this anger 
and 
negativity 
transformed 

itself 
into 
a 
positive, 
life-

affirming event.

So consider this a call for art 

as well as a call for community. 
To the creators, the artists, 
the 
people 
of 
color 
who 

have something to proclaim 
and 
proclaim 
proudly, 
this 

community is here for you.

“I’m 
open 
to 
musicians, 

I’m open to a group of actors 
who want to do monologues,” 
Lombre said. “I’m open to poets, 
spoken word people. I’m open to 
any type of art — producers, if 
you want to do a DJ set, I don’t 
care. Anybody.”

The next “A Night for Us: 

Colorful Soul” will be taking 
place 
Thursday, 
March 
30 

from 7 to 10 p.m. at Canterbury 
House, located at 721 E Huron 
Street. Come for the music, stay 
for the mac ‘n’ cheese and peach 
cobbler. It’s a place to celebrate, 
groove and to meet people and 
hear stories that are worthy of 
our unworthy ears.

PWR BTTM, Against Me! 
& more fight for LGBT art

Created by and starring two Detroit natives, Comedy Central’s 
newest sitcom puts the Motor City on display in all its comedic glory

Music, above all other forms 

of art, has a uniquely communal 
quality to its consumption. 
In its innate ability to bring 
communities together, music 
is a powerful force of social 
cohesion, naturally bringing 
rise to activism in the artists 
and fans alike.

From anti-fascism in early 

punk to powerful racial themes 
in hip-hop, music has long been 
one of the most socially active 

forms of art. Lately, there’s 
been 
a 
prominent 
increase 

in LGBT activism in today’s 
popular music scene.

Across multiple genres, the 

LGBT community has received 
increased 
representation 
in 

today’s musicians: Prominent 
LGBT artists include Against 
Me! frontwoman Laura Jane 
Grace, 
who 
has 
become 

a 
powerful 
transgender 

figurehead in punk rock, PWR 
BTTM, with their raw, catchy 
lyricism and unabashedly queer 
aesthetic and Julien Baker 
reconciling her identity with 
her upbringing in Memphis.

This 
outspoken 
support 

for the LGBT community is 
largely provided by smaller, 
indie artists — those with the 
dedicated community of fans 
who supply the means of making 
real change at the ground level. 
With their rise in popularity, 
PWR BTTM in particular has 
begun to bring together the 
LGBT 
and 
ally 
community 

alike, writing music through an 
LGBT lens that can be enjoyed 
by people of many different 
identities. It’s an incredibly 
humanizing 
experience 
to 

watch the queerness of an artist 
develop increasing recognition 
and 
influence 
on 
music’s 

mainstream.

Recently, 
PWR 
BTTM 

dropped the first two singles 
from their forthcoming record 
Pageant, the first of which — 
 

bright, pop-y “Big Beautiful 
Day” — addresses the people 
whose judgment of others is 
(obviously) unmerited. On the 
chorus, the band sings, “Curse 
every one of you who tells me 
that I cannot be who I want / 
Ain’t no fucking way you’ll fuck 
up my big beautiful day” — a 

line so infectiously defiant I 
grinned to myself the first time 
I heard it.

PWR BTTM has even been 

directly combating homophobia 
on tour. Barely a week after 
the presidential election, anti-
LGBT protesters picketed their 
show in Jackson, Mississippi 
— to which Ben Hopkins, one 
half of the duo, tweeted, “this is 
happening at the show tn. I am 
completely unafraid; I am sad 
for them,” and included a photo 
of himself giving the group 
a middle finger. The band’s 
courageous representation of 
their own identities continues 
to permeate the attitudes of 
their fans, placing themselves at 
the forefront of LGBT activism 
in music today.

On a tour last year, Modern 

Baseball 
— 
consisting 

entirely 
of 
straight 
white 

men — released a statement 
adressing their demand that 
every venue they play supply 
gender 
inclusive 
restrooms 

and included a hotline for fans 
to call to report incidences of 
harassment or discrimination 
at the shows, a safety net for 
fans originally implemented by 
Speedy Ortiz to wide acclaim. 
Now, more than ever, artists 
are showing their dedication 
to combating the increasing 
likelihood that those within 
the LGBT community will face 
very real repression in today’s 

America, and Modern Baseball 
is setting the example for allies 
showing their support.

Laura Jane Grace has been 

shattering social barriers since 
the inception of Against Me! 
in the ’90s with its progressive 
anarcho-punk themes. Coming 
out as transgender in 2012, Grace 
continues to shatter barriers 
for the LGBT community. With 
2014’s Transgender Dysphoria 

Blues, arguably one of the most 
important activist records in 
recent memory, she gave the 
world an emotional glimpse at 
being a transgender musician. 
Expanding on her story, she 
also 
released 
her 
stunning 

memoir “Tranny” last year, 
detailing her early experiences 
with gender dysphoria and 
the struggles that come with 
it. In spiteful backlash of the 
transphobic Public Facilities 
Privacy 
and 
Security 
Act 

passed 
in 
North 
Carolina, 

Grace gleefully lit her birth 
certificate (containing her birth 
name “Tom Gables”) on fire 

during their show in the state. 
The band also donated show 
proceeds to LGBT charities, 
which many other artists such 
as Father John Misty and La 
Dispute did in early 2016 for 
their performances in the state.

This past December I saw 

Kevin Devine and the Goddamn 
Band perform with Pinegrove 
and 
Petal, 
who 
announced 

that they would be collecting 
donations for the Ruth Ellis 
Center, a home for LGBT youth 
in Detroit. Accepting anything 
from cash to clothes, the artists 
used their voice and power to 
bring like-minded individuals 
into one space in order to 
bring about real, local change. 
Mid set, addressing America’s 
changing post-election social 
state, queer artist Petal stated: 
“Keep being yourself because 
existing is a form of resistance,” 
to eruptive applause. It’s these 
strong, empowering statements 
and 
actions 
from 
artists, 

whether their music is queer-
tinted or not, that continues 
the positive changes in social 
attitudes within and toward the 
LGBT community.

Music, at its core, is an art 

form that embodies emotional 
expression. 
When 
these 

emotions are used to make a 
change, 
impressively 
potent 

activism is formed. At the roots 
of popular music, devoted fan 
bases are rising up and coming 
together to implement this 
positive change, creating spaces 
at shows that are safe for people 
of all identities to come and 
enjoy the art that emboldens 
them to be themselves. Music 
is becoming an outlet for LGBT 
artists and fans to express and 
exist, and it’s a force that shows 
no signs of stopping.

“These 
people 
are 
no 

different from any of us. It 
would be impossible for anyone 
not to develop a connection 
to these families if they spent 
some time with them.”

This 
is 
VICE 
News 

Correspondent Gianna Toboni. 
In a recent interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Toboni 
shared her experiences from 
creating 
the 
documentary 

episode, “Trans Youth” for 
VICE on HBO. The 30-minute 
piece 
follows 
transgender 

youth across America, all in 
different stages of their medical 
transition. It’s raw, real and asks 
viewers to do a lot more than 
simply watch. “Trans Youth” 
asks its viewers to think about 
a group of children and parents 
who are in the fight of their life.

The “fight of their life” 

is 
not 
something 
to 
be 

taken 
metaphorically. 
The 

documentary 
begins 
in 

Pearland, Texas, with five-
year-old Kai Shappley. Kai is a 
transgender child in one of the 
most conservative, right-wing 
school districts in America. 
After spending some time at 
home with Kai and her mother, 
Kimberly, the episode follows 
Kimberly to the Pearland local 
school 
board 
meeting. 
She 

stands before her community 
members 
and 
leaders, 
and 

makes the case for Kai’s right 
to use the bathroom of her 
choosing: 

“I am a mom of a little girl 

that I would like to see live,” 
Kimberly said in the episode. 
“I am a mom of a little girl 
who has a 41% suicide rate. 
That is a very real thing. Please 
understand. I’m not fighting 
about bathrooms. I am fighting 
about her life.”

A lack of support from the 

community is crystal clear. 
The 
school 
superintendent 

left the room halfway through 
Kimberly’s 
speech. 
At 
this 

point, it would be easy to spend 
the rest of the episode exploring 
in the politics of transgender 
laws — but that’s not what 
“Trans Youth” does, and it’s a 
stronger episode for it.

The fight for Kai’s life runs 

much deeper than conservative 
politics, and not just for Kai 
— for all transgender youth, 
to live in a body with which 
he or she does not identify is 
excruciating. So painful, in fact, 
that for those who can’t remedy 
what they feel, suicide is the 
only option.

It is this fight — the fight to 

transition medically — that 
“Trans Youth” highlights.

“[The 
episode’s 
creators] 

made a decision to focus on 
the medical transition because 
(they) felt like that’s what 
other media companies hadn’t 
focused on,” Toboni said.

Bathroom laws are all anyone 

hears about — but those laws 
hardly scratch the surface of 

what it means for a transgender 
youth to transition. The medical 
process 
of 
transitioning 
is 

relatively unexplored.

“I have never done a story 

where I can talk to the experts 
and 
they 
don’t 
know 
the 

answer,” Toboni said.

This 
uncharted 
territory, 

though scary, has not deterred 
children intent on making the 
transition. Toboni interviewed 
eight-year-old Max O’Brien as 
he went through the process 
of receiving hormone blockers. 
The blockers aren’t permanent, 
but undergoing cross-hormone 
therapy is. Max and his parents 
have a few years before they 
have to make that decision. 

With no long-term data backing 
these medical treatments up, 
no one can know for sure what 
these medical treatments will 
mean 10 years down the road.

The 
episode 
does 
an 

excellent job of exploring what 
this 
uncertainty 
means 
for 

transgender youth and their 
families. Intimate interviews 
put viewers directly in the 
homes, backyards and hospital 
rooms of these people, giving 
outsiders a perspective on an 
issue which is foreign to them.

Uncertainty about the long-

terms effects isn’t the only issue 
with the medical transition 
process. It’s expensive. Very 
expensive. Toboni estimated 
that a hormone blocker costs 
between $750 and $800 per 
month. So, the transition is, per 
Toboni, “completely prohibitive 
if insurance is not covering it.”

In the wake of President 

Donald 
Trump’s 
executive 

order 
to 
dismantle 
many 

benefits of the Affordable Care 
Act, families of transgender 
youth are in a state of limbo. As 
a viewer watching interviews 
filmed prior to the executive 
order, a major question raised 
is how things have changed 
since. Toboni and her crew 
have stayed in touch since the 

election.

“There’s no other way to put 

it, they’re devastated,” Toboni 
said. “They don’t know how this 
is going to affect their health 
insurance, 
whether 
they’re 

going to be able to continue 
transitioning.”

The episode features men and 

women at each stage of their 
transition — from pre-medical, 
like Kai, to surgical, like 18-year-
old Charlotte. Charlotte has 
lived at the Waltham House — a 
group home in Boston for LGBT 
youth — since she was 14, after 
her mother threatened her life 
for wanting to be a woman. For 
someone like Charlotte, made 
to feel like she “had no place 
in this world,” the opportunity 
to surgically transition is life-
altering. It allows her to feel 
comfortable in her own skin.

Without the assistance of 

health insurance, however, this 
might not be possible. Those 
unaffected cannot fully imagine 
the emotional toll it takes. 
15-year-old 
Steevie 
Geagan 

offers a glimpse.

“You have no idea how hard 

it is, waking up and not really 
connecting with what’s there,” 
Geagan said in the episode. “To 
prolong the treatment process, 
would be dreadful.”

By highlighting the medical 

transition, 
the 
documentary 

is better equipped to capture 
the emotional fight America’s 
transgender youth face daily. 
The biggest take-away is that 
this issue is about more than 
politics. It’s people’s lives. To 
highlight the medical process 
and present it to a large audience 
creates discussion that may not 
have been present before.

“Trans 
Youth” 
showcases 

people who are fighting for 
their right to be happy.

“I think that’s the reason 

we do this work. To help 
educate people and help those 
influencers, 
policy 
makers, 

civilians 
go 
on 
into 
their 

communities and act in a way 
that they feel is appropriate,” 
Toboni said, reflecting on the 
episode’s potential to inspire 
viewers. “That’s the first step in 
creating change.”

Those in Ann Arbor who are 

eager to make change don’t 
have to look far. The University 
of Michigan’s Spectrum Center 
offers 
programs, 
academic 

services and a comprehensive 
list 
of 
LGBT 
student 

organizations. 
Residential 

group homes like the Waltham 
House exist nationwide.

Though they live in an almost 

constant state of uncertainty 
and turmoil, Toboni admired 
that the transgender youth will 
not be deterred.

“They’re still going to protest, 

they’re still connecting with 
their community and they’re 
continuing to fight,” she said.

“Trans Youth” is available 

to stream for free on YouTube 
through March 18th courtesy of 
HBO.

‘Not Your Negro’ brings 
Baldwin’s words to life

James Baldwin, novelist and 

playwright, tells the story of 
Black men in America with a 
voice of wisdom, 
sorrow 
and 

mourning. 
Baldwin’s 
memoir 
is 

a 
touching, 

personal account 
of combating the 
ever-prevalent 
racism in the United States while 
paying due tribute to his friends, 
Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and 
Martin Luther King Jr., who died 
trying to end it.

From Baldwin’s poetic prose 

to Samuel L. Jackson’s calming, 
hushed narration (Though the 
actor usually prefers a forceful 
yell, as evidenced by Marvel’s 
Nick Fury, “Snakes on a Plane” 
and 
“Pulp 
Fiction”), 
Raoul 

Peck’s 
(“Murder 
in 
Pacot”) 

documentary version of the 
author’s unfinished manuscript, 
“Remember This House,” is 
a meaningful homage to the 
unpublished masterpiece.

More than just depicting a life, 

the film depicts a struggle — the 
struggle of the African American 
community 
in 
America 
and 

the struggle of the people who 
fought to end that struggle. 

Within the span of five years, 
three great men were murdered 
for fighting in the name of civil 
rights, equality and justice.

First was Medgar Evers, then 

it was Malcolm X, then Martin 
Luther King Jr. The world 

lost 
three 
great 

leaders, but James 
Baldwin lost three 
dear 
friends. 
In 

the film, Baldwin 
recalls the details 
and 
memories 

of 
discovering 

the news of the 

assassinations. 
He 
was 
on 

vacation when he found out 
about Medgar over the radio, he 
was out to dinner when he found 
out about Malcolm, he was in 
L.A. when he got the call about 
Martin. Baldwin’s losses are 
what inspired him to write the 
famed manuscript and they drive 
the film forward.

“I Am Not Your Negro” 

manages to seamlessly weave 
together found and real footage 
into 
a 
clear 
and 
stunning 

portrayal of Baldwin’s work. 
Even 
Baldwin’s 
plentiful 

references 
to 
Hollywood 

blockbusters like “Guess Who’s 
Coming to Dinner” and “Dance, 
Fools, Dance” are incorporated 
with skill and artistry. The 
collage of images compiled into 
the film takes Baldwin’s words 
and turns them into the perfect 

narration for events both past 
and present.

The 
historical 
footage 
of 

Baldwin is representative of his 
personality, adding his own voice 
and mannerisms to the film. 
The audience finds him on “The 
Dick Cavett Show” flicking the 
ash from his cigarette, speaking 
eloquently in the hallowed halls 
of Cambridge, riding in the 
passenger seat through his native 
Harlem, rubbing shoulders with 
the likes of Marlon Brando, 
Sammy 
Davis 
Jr., 
Harry 

Belafonte and Charlton Heston.

In addition to providing a 

portrait of Baldwin during his 
lifetime, the film showcases 
a 
variety 
of 
footage 
and 

photographs illustrating a still 
evident racial divide within 
American society. From riots in 
the streets of Ferguson to police 
brutality in Los Angeles, the film 
intertwines Baldwin’s memories 
of the disturbing past with 
today’s disturbing present. Raoul 
Peck has compiled an impressive 
arsenal of found footage that tells 
a story in and of itself; it is only a 
fitting that it sings so beautifully 
in duet with Baldwin’s work.

“I Am Not Your Negro” is an 

innovative and simply excellent 
documentary that gives voice 
to the genius of James Baldwin, 
while addressing race in America 
from a perspective both old and 
new.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

alt-J is a band long recog-

nized for its music videos. My 
first-ever introduction to the 
band was when a friend rec-
ommended me not their music, 
but to their music video for 
“Breezeblocks” and try to fig-
ure out what was going on. The 
band hasn’t been afraid to get 
strange with their videos over 
the past few years, and that 
holds true with this week’s 
“3WW,” an imaginative vir-
tual translation of the pain of 
denied love.

The video opens in dark-

ness, and then shades of 
golden-brown light begin fil-
tering into view in the form 
of geometric shapes. At the 
same time, a single wandering 
guitar guides us into the soft 
percussive rhythm that soon 
becomes the backbone of the 
song. The sound is endlessly 
soft and exploratory, and it 
evokes waking up in the morn-
ing or stepping into the light 
out of a dark room.

Equally intriguing are the 

corresponding 
images. 
The 

rapidly flashing shapes from 
the very beginning set the 
tone for the rest of the video, 
which looks like it takes its 
animation from some com-
puter program or video game. 

The constant flashing and 
switching 
between 
images 

makes it hard to discern any 
concrete plot, but the images 
themselves still suggest dis-
tinct feelings and senses of 
meaning. Many of the images 
recur — a man walking into a 
room to meet another person, a 
pinkish shape floating upward 
into a near-cloudless sky, a 
field of grass with a single tree 
beginning to bloom — and con-
vey a sense of continuation, of 
nature taking on meaning in 
an unnatural world.

The succession of images 

repeats several times in the 
same order, and for all the hope 
that comes across in the bright 
landscapes, like a beautiful 
dock and a road through green 
fields, the song definitely car-
ries a strong element of sad-
ness, of hope lost. The figure 
walking alone toward the per-
son in the room never reaches 
them; the series always ends 
with the final note of an object 
or figure, lying dead in the 
middle of a road. I took this 
as an indication of the futility 
of the speaker’s love, but the 
video is constructed in a way 
that lends itself to personal 
interpretations, rather than 
a clear narrative. No matter 
the 
interpretation, 
though, 

“3WW” is a beautiful example 
of how a music video doesn’t 
need a plot or even a live cast 
of people in order to convey 
something deep, meaningful 
and complete.
