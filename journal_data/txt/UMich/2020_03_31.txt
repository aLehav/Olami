While 
many 
Americans 
are 

following the urging of the Centers 

for Disease Control and Prevention 

to practice social distancing due to 

the COVID-19 outbreak, those in 

prisons are often unable to comply 

with this recommendation.

 Nora Krinitsky, interim director 

of the Prison Creative Arts Project 

and director of the University of 

Michigan Carceral State Project, 

said one of the reasons the risk of 

contracting COVID-19 is so great for 

incarcerated individuals is due to 

their close quarters. Krinitsky cited 

an example of overcrowding in the 

Women’s Huron Valley Correctional 

Facility in Ypsilanti, which is the 

only women’s correctional facility 

in the state of Michigan. The facility 

currently houses more than 2,200 

women but was built to house a 

capacity of only 1,100 inmates.

 “If people are within proximity 

with one another and have the 

virus, the spread of it goes up 

exponentially,” 
Krinitsky 
said. 

“That 
is 
what 
people 
inside 

are facing because they cannot 

successfully 
socially 
distance 

(from) one another. So that means 

that we could see people become 

infected and ill, potentially almost 

wholesale, within a prison very 

quickly, meaning in a number of 

days.”

 Krinitsky said many people 

develop 
underlying 
conditions 

while incarcerated due to the 

stressful 
environment 
and 

commonly inadequate health care. 

These conditions have been cited 

by the CDC to increase one’s chance 

of contracting the virus and could 

make fighting it off much more 

difficult.

 
“Healthcare 
in 
prisons 
is 

sometimes difficult to access and 

sometimes non-existent,” Krinitsky 

said. “It’s already the case that 

people who are inside or people 

who come home from prison often 

have really acute medical conditions 

or chronic conditions that they’re 

dealing with that have either been 

caused by their incarceration or 

exacerbated by their incarceration.”

 
Chris 
Gautz, 
Michigan 

Department 
of 
Corrections 

spokesperson, said the MDC is 

taking 
drastic 
precautions 
to 

reduce the likelihood of the spread 

of the virus inside their facilities. 

Gautz spoke of precautions for 

social distancing, such as reducing 

General Educational Development 

and substance abuse class sizes and 

reducing the number of inmates 

in the dining hall during meal 

times. As of March 30, 80 currently 

incarcerated people have tested 

positive in Michigan.

 “We are reducing the class sizes 

that we have for different GED 

classes, substance abuse, other 

types of cognitive programming 

that we do every day,” Gautz said. 

“Typically less than 10 individuals 

in those classes, and we’re having 

them sit further apart while they’re 

in the class. We’re doing the same 

thing for our chow hall so when they 

go out to eat meals, instead of having 

an entire housing unit go out to eat 

together, which could be anywhere 

from 80 to 160 people at a time, we’re 

doing half of that amount.”

Students talk impact of social distancing

Shifting to online classes, new CDC guidelines affect mental health, productivity

LSA sophomore Sree Anumolu 

thought staying in her apartment 

in Ann Arbor after classes were 

moved 
online 
would 
be 
fun. 

However, as more of her friends 

started to leave, she decided to 

return home as well. 

Anumolu 
has 
obsessive-

compulsive disorder, which she 

said can affect her productivity 

and well-being. She told The Daily 

having a community and staying 

busy with school helps her to 

manage OCD triggers, but social 

distancing prevents her from using 

socializing as a coping mechanism.

“My OCD has been really bad 

for the past two years, but this 

year started getting a lot better 

because I just talked to my friends 

about it and just tried to actively 

forget about it,” Anumolu said. 

“Trying to get out of the habits 

and being with people helped a lot. 

I remember compared to freshman 

year, I became much more social 

this year because I just knew that 

having a strong circle was what I 

needed to get out of it. For classes, 

I made sure I kept myself busy 

because if I keep myself busy, 

those thoughts don’t come to me.”

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman 
Payal 
Parida 
said 

she saw her friends on campus 

every day and the lack of social 

interaction has been the hardest 

part about leaving campus. 

“I had my friends, we would 

spend 24/7 together,” Parida said. 

“I would not go a day without 

seeing them and they were pretty 

much like my second family. So 

having that be completely cut off 

like, so abrupt, was extremely 

hard. You realize how important 

social interaction is and as a human 

being, isolation is so difficult, at 

least for me.”

Christine 
Asidao, 
associate 

director 
of 
community 

engagement 
and 
outreach 
for 

Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, and Todd Sevig, director 

of CAPS, told The Daily in an 

email how CAPS is offering virtual 

and phone appointments to those 

experiencing anxiety due to social 

distancing.

2 — Tuesday, March 31, 2020
News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The closure of all K-12 public 

schools in Michigan has left 

School of Education students — 

who were in the middle of their 

student-teaching or in-classroom 

internships — using alternative 

methods 
to 
complete 
these 

requirements.

Shortly after all K-12 public 

schools in the state were closed 

due to the threat of COVID-

19 on March 12, the Michigan 

Department 
of 
Education 

announced 
that 
universities 

can now waive a portion of the 

required hours if they feel the 

student has met the expectations 

of the state and school.

Dean 
Elizabeth 
Moje 
said 

the School of Education was in 

constant contact with MDE as 

the outbreak developed. She said 

they have written confirmation 

from MDE that students will be 

able to receive the certification 

remotely.

Moje said Education students 

achieve 
the 
set 
amount 
of 

required 
hours 
needed 
for 

certification prior to student 

teaching. However, the school 

has students receive additional 

hours to be better prepared for 

their teaching career.

“I’m confident that although 

we all believe that the best 

education is direct face-to-face, 

clinical practice with children, 

(MDE) will support us as we 

work to provide the very best 

alternatives for our interns and 

student teachers,” Moje said.

In the first year of the two-year 

School of Education program, 

students 
serve 
as 
teaching 

interns two days a week for four 

to five hours a day. Students 

complete this internship, which 

is referred to as their practicum, 

for two semesters before serving 

as student-teachers in their final 

semester 
before 
graduating. 

This 
certification 
process 
is 

part of the Educator Preparation 

Program.

Though 
students 
will 
still 

achieve the required number of 

hours, some Education students 

are concerned that their ability 

to advance through the program 

will be impacted as many are 

trying to achieve both a primary 

and 
secondary 
endorsement. 

An 
endorsement 
area 
is 
a 

specific area, such as English 

or Chemistry, that teachers are 

certified to teach. For students 

receiving an endorsement in two 

areas, they require additional 

time to complete the credits.

Education 
junior 
Alexa 

Moore said she was worried 

about achieving her secondary 

endorsement in a world language 

because she cannot travel abroad 

due to the current restrictions.

Moore said there are very 

limited 
offerings 
for 
online 

alternatives during the spring 

and summer semesters. She said 

she is worried about graduating 

on time.

“I think a lot of the world 

language people are in that same 

boat where they’re trying to 

figure out how to complete their 

endorsement during the summer 

so then they can be on track for 

graduation and it just doesn’t 

seem possible,” Moore said.

Moore was in the middle of 

completing her practicum — the 

internship that precedes student-

teaching — at the second of her 

three assigned locations before 

the University moved to online 

classes. While many student-

teachers are still working to 

create lesson plans and teach 

their students remotely, the work 

is different for juniors who are 

completing 
their 
practicum. 

Moore said her work was based 

around 
reading, 
analyzing 

articles and writing essays. 

Similarly, 
Education 
junior 

Kayla Chinitz said it is difficult to 

complete the practicum remotely, 

as face-to-face interaction with 

students is the most beneficial 

way to learn. Currently, Chinitz 

is writing essays as an alternative 

method to complete the course.

“One of my assignments was 

on summative versus formative 

assignments and writing a 500-

word essay on that doesn’t quite 

feel the same as being in the 

classroom,” Chinitz said.

Education 
senior 
Lauren 

Robisch, who is student-teaching 

at Pioneer High School, said 

while she is sad she will not be 

able to complete her student-

teaching in person, she said she 

thinks this abrupt change is 

providing a learning experience 

in preparing for the unexpected.

“It’s kind of given me a lot of 

flexibility and thinking about 

what I need as a first-year teacher 

and what would happen if I was 

the one teaching right now in this 

circumstance,” Robisch said. “I 

don’t think any of us were ready 

for (classes) to end, especially 

the way that ended. But it’s not 

over. That’s the one thing that I 

think we all need to recognize 

and look at.”

Moje 
echoed 
Robisch’s 

statement, 
noting 
that 
while 

completing 
practicum 
and 

student-teaching online is not 

ideal, teachers across the country 

are all in the same situation. She 

said this is a learning opportunity 

for Education students to think 

about their future practice as 

teachers.

“We believe in the power of 

face-to-face 
clinical 
practice, 

so this is not our first choice,” 

Moje said. “But we are doing our 

very best work to ensure that 

our interns and student teachers 

are getting the preparation they 

need.”

The 2020 Stamps School in-person exhibition might have canceled, but that didn’t stop staff photographer Alexandria Pompei from finishing her Inte-
grative Project from home Thursday.
Education students express 
concern over schools closing

K-12 closures, switch to online learning throughout state causes 
changes in teaching curriculum, in-person classroom internships 


During the event, attendees 

typically stand on their feet and 

dance for 24 hours continuously. 

Each year, VictorThon raises 

awareness 
and 
hundreds 
of 

thousands of dollars for pediatric 

rehabilitation services at C.S. 

Mott and Beaumont Children’s 

Hospital. The event connects 

University students with DMUM 

families, therapists from DMUM 

programs and other members of 

the Ann Arbor community. 

LSA 
senior 
Sydney 
Jose, 

executive director of DMUM, 

said she and her executive team 

started 
planning 
the 
virtual 

event about two weeks ago after 

deciding they wanted to host 

VictorThon no matter what.

“The idea that VictorThon could 

be canceled was heartbreaking, to 

say the least, because that’s really 

what we’ve been working up 

towards all year,” Jose said. “Our 

first reaction as soon as we found 

out that we probably wouldn’t be 

able to have it in-person was that 

this is a really important event to 

us, our community, to our cause, 

to our families and not doing 

something was just not really an 

option.” 

According to Jose, DMUM’s 

technology crew helped them 

set up a live stream while board 

members collaborated to record 

content 
before 
leaving 
Ann 

Arbor. The group also asked all 

of their original participants, 

such as local therapists and 

student groups, to send in videos 

or other digital representations 

of their work. Jose said DMUM 

was able to recreate most of its 

original schedule of events in a 

digital format.

“Pretty 
much 
all 
of 
(the 

planning) was done digitally, 

with all of our leadership team 

on phone calls and Zoom calls,” 

Jose said. “It was definitely a 

whirlwind, it was a team effort. 

I don’t know if any of us knew 

exactly what it was going to look 

like until it happened, but (we 

are) definitely very, very proud 

of it.”

LSA senior Tosin Adeyemi, 

dancer captain for Alpha Epsilon 

Delta, said she knew she wanted 

to be a part of DMUM before she 

even came to the University and 

has been an active member since 

her freshman year. 

She added that VictorThon 

gave her the opportunity to grow 

closer with her team members 

and create lasting friendships 

within the DMUM community 

over the years. She said this 

year’s VictorThon was all the 

more important to her since it 

was her last as a student at the 

University. 

“It’s really about supporting 

kids 
and 
giving 
them 

opportunities to do sports and 

social clubs and just things that 

I might have taken for granted 

in my own childhood,” Adeyemi 

said.

LSA 
junior 
Max 
Sharin, 

financial management co-chair 

of DMUM, echoed that same 

sense of pride as he expressed 

his admiration for his team 

and 
everything 
they 
have 

accomplished in the last two 

weeks.

“It’s been really incredible 

for me to see our leadership 

body rally behind the move to 

online,” Max said. “I feel that a 

lot of people say that you can see 

what an organization or what 

an individual is like when they 

have to work under pressure 

and I feel that really came out in 

these past two weeks when we 

all worked together.” 

Jose said one unexpected 

positive realization from the 

shift to digital is that it has 

increased alumni engagement. 

She said she thinks this is 

because 
the 
digital 
version 

was more accessible and more 

engaging to those who wanted 

to attend and couldn’t be in Ann 

Arbor, compared to the usual 

in-person event. 

Though they were unable to 

conduct their event in-person, 

Jose said she is proud of her 

team and the experience they 

were able to create.

“Obviously it’s bittersweet, 

knowing 
that 
our 
whole 

leadership 
team 
has 
been 

working up to the traditional 

in-person event all year, so there 

was definitely some heartbreak 

of knowing that that hard work 

wasn’t going to come to fruition,” 

Jose said. “But, people pivoted 

really quickly, and we were really 

happy with how it turned out.”

 In addition to these social 

distancing 
practices, 
anyone 

entering the prison is screened with 

a questionnaire upon entrance. 

This 
screening 
has 
questions 

about recent travel, exposure to 

anyone who has tested positive 

for COVID-19 or shown symptoms 

and whether they themselves are 

experiencing any symptoms. Each 

individual has their temperature 

checked and, if normal, is then 

allowed into the facility for work.

 On March 23, a person in 

custody 
of 
the 
MDOC 
was 

confirmed to have contracted the 

virus; this was the first instance 

of 
COVID-19 
of 
a 
currently 

incarcerated person in MI. Gautz 

said the state’s protocol for what 

will be done if an incarcerated 

person tests positive for COVID-

19 includes transferring them to 

Charles Egeler Reception and 

Guidance 
Center, 
a 
state-run 

medical facility for inmates.

 “First of all, obviously isolation, 

putting a mask on that individual, 

and then making sure that staff 

who are going to be dealing 

with that individual also have 

the proper personal protective 

equipment,” Gautz said. “Then we 

would make a determination on 

whether or not we could continue 

to house them in isolation at their 

facility, or if we would transport 

them in an MDOC ambulance 

to a health center in Jackson … 

We would only make that type of 

movement if the person was far 

away from Jackson.”

 On Monday, a person in custody 

of the MDOC was confirmed 

to have contracted the virus. 

Gautz said an incarcerated male 

previously housed at the Kinross 

Correctional Facility in Chippewa 

County was sent to a local hospital 

on March 11. He was treated for an 

underlying medical condition that 

was not COVID-19. Medical staff 

monitored him for a week and did 

not feel that he needed to be tested 

for the novel coronavirus.

Gautz 
said 
the 
man 
was 

transferred on March 17 to a 

different hospital in the Northern 

Lower Michigan region, where he 

was placed on a floor where they 

were treating community members 

suspected of having the virus. 

Gautz said the MDOC is unsure of 

how the individual contracted the 

virus, but they did not send him to 

the hospital with any symptoms of 

COVID-19.

 “We can’t say that he definitely 

got it at that hospital, but all we 

know was that we didn’t send him 

to the hospital because we thought 

he had symptoms,” Gautz said. 

“He was at the hospital and he was 

around other people who were 

under suspicion of having it and 

then he tested positive.”

 Gautz said the man has been 

at the same hospital since March 

17 and will be transferred to 

the 
Charles 
Egeler 
Reception 

and Guidance Center as soon as 

hospital officials deem him stable. 

He will be put into an isolation 

chamber with a negative pressure 

system to limit any spread of the 

virus to other individuals working 

and being housed at this facility. 

Gautz said other precautions such 

as masks and gowns are ready at 

the location.

 Krinitsky said releasing older 

people from prisons would alleviate 

a great deal of the population at 

risk, but that greater acts must be 

made to protect prisoners inside 

the facilities.

 “The first step would be to 

release 
people 
from 
prison,” 

Krinitsky said. “That is the only 

step that would be truly effective 

in stopping the spread of the virus 

and protecting people’s health. 

The American Friends Service 

Committee circulated a letter in 

which they lay out very clearly why 

this is an important step to take, to 

release elderly prisoners and people 

who are medically vulnerable.”

 Despite what has been done so 

far by the MDOC, Krinitsky said she 

feels more must be accomplished to 

salvage people’s health.

 “The truth is, we know on the 

outside (of prison) that all people, 

regardless of your age or medical 

status, are vulnerable,” Krinitsky 

said. “So truly I know the MDOC 

has taken the steps of going into 

quarantine 
and 
doing 
special 

cleaning of prisons, but these are 

really half-measures.”

 Katharine Boasberg, PCAP 

member 
and 
LSA 
sophomore, 

shared 
her 
feelings 
on 
the 

isolation 
techniques 
performed 

inside 
correctional 
facilities. 

She 
discussed 
problems 
that 

could result from using isolation 

wards for medical reasons, due to 

their normal usage as a punitive 

measure. 

“Solitary 
confinement 
and 

isolation has historically been used 

as a tactic to further distort and 

destroy the psyche of many people 

who are incarcerated,” Boasberg 

said. 
“Having 
government-

mandated isolation already worsens 

the psyche of being physically 

isolated (from society, and this) 

couples with the fear that on the 

inside, you’re incapable of socially 

isolating because you’re in such an 

intense group environment.” 

Krinitsky said isolation can be 

destructive in a normal situation, 

current crisis climate aside. She 

said vulnerability in prisons is not 

highly rewarded, so individuals 

may be hesitant to share their 

symptoms with staff.

In addition to tele-counseling, 

the organization put together 

a Mental Health Care Package 

to encourage students to find 

creative ways to fight boredom.

“We are trying to reframe 

‘social distancing’ to ‘physical 

distancing,’” Asidao said. “We 

want students to stay connected 

socially, albeit virtually, because 

that is crucial to maintaining and 

improving our mental health.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Nishanth 
Reddy 
said 
though 

the setup of his classes has been 

mostly the same other than 

being online, he misses the social 

interaction of being on campus.

“Not walking to class, talking 

to my friends in-person (and) 

studying with them in the library 

are things I miss, for sure,” Reddy 

said.

Productive spaces, such as 

libraries, are also not options 

for students to study without 

distractions. 
Engineering 

freshman Zachary Goldston said 

he preferred the basement of the 

Duderstadt 
Library. 
Goldston 

said there is an adjustment to 

doing work since returning home.

“I was able to focus best 

when I had my own space in 

the Duderstadt Library in the 

basement. I was able to focus 

for hours, get some really good 

studying in, get my homework 

done and even some side projects 

for clubs and stuff done as well,” 

Goldston said. “Being at home is 

definitely a transition from where 

I’m used to just sleeping and 

relaxing … I try to make myself 

study in other places around my 

house so that I don’t feel like I’m 

cooped up all the time.”

To 
occupy 
her 
time, 
LSA 

freshman Xinyi Wang talks to 

members of the Taekwondo club, a 

student organization she is a part 

of. Wang is from Shanghai, China 

and stayed in the dorms for two 

weeks after classes went online, 

returning home recently. She said 

she experienced all of her friends 

leaving campus until she was the 

only one left. Through all of this, 

Wang said the Taekwondo club is 

continuing to stay social through 

individual activities and that has 

helped her with the adjustment to 

campus. 

“We have a 14-day challenge 

that people can just do every day,” 

Wang said. “It’s hard to keep up 

with the challenge a lot, but it 

gives me a feeling that I’m still 

able to hang out with my friends. 

It just feels good.” 

Wang is also part of the 

Residential College and said her 

professors have been supportive 

throughout the whole housing 

process. 

“All the RC teachers have 

their phone number and emails 

available in case anyone wanted 

to contact them,” Wang said. 

“This just makes me feel really 

warm and I know that these 

teachers really care about us and 

how we really feel.”

The RC is making efforts to 

make students feel like they are 

still in East Quad from their own 

homes. RC students have set up a 

GroupMe chat called “RC Love” 

where they send memes and 

pictures to cheer people up. They 

also started the “Quaranzine” — a 

Google folder where students can 

submit writing and multimedia 

content — and Virtual Greene 

Lounge meeting through Zoom.

Esha Biswas, student affairs 

coordinator of RC, said the RC 

started these initiatives to help 

the students cope through hard 

times. 

“We just want students to 

feel like even though they are 

not physically in East Quad, we 

want to still have that sense of 

community that East Quad gives 

us,” Biswas said. “It’s hard to 

go from being in a community 

where you’re in the same building 

with your friends and you have 

classes in the same building and 

office hours with faculty and 

you have academic services and 

advising 
appointments 
all 
in 

the same building … To go from 

that to being completely isolated 

from your RC network, to being 

scattered all across the country 

and all across the world.”

Anumolu said she wants people 

to remember they are not alone 

in feeling down during strange 

times. She said finding resources 

to cope through social distancing 

will help people get through this 

time with a positive experience. 

“I just want you or anybody 

else to know that, especially 

people that are suffering through 

addiction — things that only 

become worse through isolation — 

I want them to know that they’re 

not alone and that this was just 

very unwanted,” Anumolu said. 

“No one saw this coming. We 

should all try to do the best we 

can to make sure we don’t relapse 

… But I just want them to know to 

continue staying strong.”

O

n Feb. 2, two heavyweight 

titans met up for what 

some described as the 

most anticipated boxing match in 20 

years. My personal excitement for 

this fight was driven by an interest 

in boxing that began with following 

the Andy Ruiz-Anthony Joshua 

fight this past summer. Boxing had 

grown on me after the initial shock 

of watching a shorter, heavier fighter 

like Ruiz hang with the physical 

specimen Joshua and knock him 

down to the canvas. After watching 

numerous videos breaking down 

their fight, I realized that boxing is 

much more than two brutes giving 

and receiving bloody blows to each 

other’s faces. The sport is nearly 

artistic, and the best fighters use 

rhythm in their movements, swaying 

side-to-side while bouncing on their 

toes. The combination of punches 

are a free-form, creative expression 

of the individual throwing them, 

and the varying styles can produce 

spectacular back-and-forth battles.

Boxing quickly became without 

a doubt the most fascinating sport in 

my eyes, and I spent time watching 

old Muhammad Ali footage, the 

man who coined the phrase, “float 

like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” The 

idea of dedicating a life completely 

to one purpose and sharpening one’s 

physical, mental and spiritual form 

to achieve it is something appealing 

— particularly to a young, future-

driven college student like myself. 

The ultimate beauty of the sport, 

however, is the antithesis of this 

complex and involved preparation: 

The primitive act of sending the man 

standing across from you down to 

the canvas. The merging of the sport 

as it is today, with its modern-day 

top fighters representing our time 

and culture, with an archaic practice 

and craft is what makes boxing 

entertaining but not brutal or savage.

A rematch between Ruiz and 

Joshua occurred a few months 

later, during which Joshua was able 

to, through tactical but somewhat 

passive boxing, reclaim his belts and 

avenge his loss. This reestablished 

him as one of three big names in 

heavyweight boxing — the other two 

being Tyson Fury, a British boxer of 

Irish heritage known for his savage 

trash talk and awkward but brilliant 

style of fighting, and Deontay Wilder, 

a raw fighter out of Alabama who has 

what many consider to be the most 

powerful punch in all of boxing. 

After a roller coaster of a fight in 

December 2018, during which Fury 

got up following a brutal right-hand, 

left-hook combo from Wilder in the 

12th round, the final result was a 

controversial draw. A rematch was 

announced this February and I could 

hardly wait, watching interviews 

and training footage months before 

in preparation.

As the fight approached, I couldn’t 

help but experience a slight feeling 

of loss in not having anyone to talk 

about my excitement with. The 

boxing fandom is a niche crowd, 

and finding someone well-versed in 

the sport is not likely to happen on 

campus unless one goes to a bar on 

fight night or spars on the heavy bag 

at their local gym.

I knew there was no shortage of 

sports enthusiasts at the University 

of Michigan, as evidenced by the 

historic turnouts at football games 

despite adverse weather and the sold-

out student section at U-M basketball 

games. With combat sports on the rise 

as Ultimate Fighting Championship 

and Mixed Martial Arts popularity 

surges, I was surprised that it was so 

difficult to find people that gravitated 

toward boxing. In my mind boxing 

is more technical than sports like 

football or basketball, as there are 

more restrictive rules that make the 

competition less of a free-for-all and 

place more emphasis on tact.

As I contemplated how alone I 

was in my passion for boxing in my 

social circle, I thought of how the 

boxing industry exposes itself to the 

outside and sporting worlds. As a 

sports fan myself, prior to hearing 

about Joshua-Ruiz by happenstance, 

I had lived my life with no clue about 

any happenings in the fight world. 

If one flips to ESPN and watches 

SportsCenter, football, basketball, 

baseball, hockey, tennis and even golf 

are often discussed among pundits 

and in news stories. Comparatively 

speaking, one is much less likely to 

hear about boxing in a general forum 

of sports commentators, especially 

outside of a select few names. The 

pay-per-view model is ultimately to 

blame for this, as fights like Fury-

Wilder cost between $60 and $100 to 

watch, a price only a committed fan 

would be willing to pay.

After sparking some curiosity 

in my friends, we decided to watch 

Fury-Wilder II in a bar on campus. 

Upon arriving at Buffalo Wild Wings, 

the only place we figured would 

definitely be carrying the fight, we 

were met with a sign on the front 

door reading “We are not showing 

Fury-Wilder,” and thus were forced 

to drive to their Boardwalk Drive 

location off-campus. Even as a fan, 

this was a difficult thing to commit 

to for the entire Saturday night.

Pay-per-view is causing a large 

demographic of college students 

to miss out on what this incredible 

sport has to offer. Of course, the 

top boxers benefit from the current 

system. 
Floyd 
Mayweather 
is 

perhaps the ultimate manifestation 

of the benefits of raking in views. 

He became the highest-paid athlete 

of the 2010s by making $915 million 

from his fights, including the 2017 

match against Conor McGregor, 

which had a reported 4.3 million 

buys. Ultimately, greediness on 

the part of these athletes has 

historically caused the biggest fights 

to happen much later than they 

should. Mayweather’s “fight of the 

century” against Manny Pacquiao 

happened when he was 38 years 

old and Pacquiao was 36 years old, 

both of them over the hill in their 

careers. However, the recent flurry 

of heavyweight fights between top 

contenders indicates a positive trend 

on this front.

Getting more eyes on the sport 

is not a matter of getting people 

to open up to it, but rather putting 

it more clearly in front of them. 

Giving context to the fights with 

an introduction to the fighters 

and their story arcs would make 

boxing much more entertaining 

to a casual fan, and could provide 

a catalyst to rope viewers in. After 

that, all it requires is one good fight 

to pique someone’s interest and get 

them hooked. This will happen 

when boxers are put on par with 

other athletes in their exposure in 

the media to the general sporting 

public. Broadcasting companies 

will only be incentivized to give 

them this coverage when they can 

show these matches themselves on 

their networks. The pay-per-view 

model should be eliminated entirely, 

even if it may result in slightly less 

revenue for boxers and promoters. 

Even subscription-based services, 

which are currently on the rise, 

should not be the primary model 

for big fights. Outsiders to the sport 

will not have any incentive to spend 

money to watch.

A

s the United States is swept 

off its feet by the spread of the 

coronavirus, many questions have 

gone unanswered. A great deal of stress 

has accumulated over when society will 

go back to normal, and it seems that 

the topic of the coronavirus lurks in 

the background of every conversation 

I have: It’s completely unavoidable. 

There is nothing else to talk about, as 

COVID-19 has brought the world as 

we know it to a halt. We must remain 

in our homes and twiddle our thumbs, 

hoping for a positive headline on CNN 

or an inflection in the anchor’s voice 

that might denote a fleeting sense that 

hope exists. Businesses fear that they’ll 

shutter while hospitals are understaffed 

and underprepared. Students vacate 

universities, parents stay home from 

work and people in their 60s and beyond 

worry for their livelihood. This pandemic 

has grabbed us by the shirt collar and 

asked for our lunch money. How will we 

respond?

Many speculate that the disruption to 

the economy caused by the disease will 

induce harsh, depression-level economic 

conditions regarding job loss and deficit 

increase. 
We’re 
living 
through 
an 

unprecedented era; never has time stood 

still quite as it does now. The economy 

and the general livelihood of people is in 

decline. Gas prices fall as more employers 

send their workers home with promises 

of partial payment plans and families 

putter around their homes stress eating 

and doing puzzles, waiting for the day 

when we wake up from the nightmare 

that we’re living in. Businesses are just 

as uncertain as citizens as to how long 

this situation will last, and the stress of it 

largely lies on the timeline of the disease’s 

restrictions on society. How long will 

people be out of work, and how are we 

going to make it through all of this?

With all of the economic and personal 

travel restrictions being implemented 

around the country, life has shut down 

in America. The question emerging is 

imperative to answer: What degree of the 

spreading of the disease should we allow 

when the livelihood of people and the 

economy are at stake? The public needs 

to know more about the disease, that 

much is certain, but at what point do we 

reopen the world? If we’re waiting for the 

total number of new cases to reach zero 

or for the growth rate to plateau then we 

could be in for the long haul. This shelter-

in-place situation in your home — with 

seemingly every industry and aspect of 

your everyday life at the mercy of the 

coronavirus — can’t go on forever. At 

some point, the conversation needs to be 

about what degree of the disease existing 

can be tolerated so as to not ruin people’s 

lives and the economic condition of the 

world.

I am not a pessimist; I don’t believe 

this to be an apocalypse. I think the 

world was deeply unready for something 

of this magnitude. The coronavirus 

is a test of the world’s ability to react 

and take proactive measures against 

a viral outbreak that many countries 

flunked, as the U.S. and Europe didn’t 

close their borders soon enough to 

stop the spread of the disease. I believe 

that things will return to normal soon, 

that the disease will plateau and that 

our lives will resume. These times 

are unprecedented, so what I’m really 

curious to see is what society will look 

like after this is said and done. Will 

100,000 people gather for a football 

game again without batting an eye? 

With something as drastic as this, with 

everyone witnessing the closing of 

society and experiencing the isolation 

it has caused, who knows if we will 

ever get this out of the back of our 

minds.

Many lessons can be learned from 

this pandemic. First, a government 

must take swift and decisive action 

to protect the health of its citizens. 

Countries waited too long to ban 

international travel, and that allowed 

the disease to spread like wildfire, as 

travelers brought it back home and 

exposed it to new areas completely. 

Second, threats involving the health 

and livelihood of citizens should 

always be taken seriously. I fear 

that arrogance may have compelled 

the current U.S. administration to 

underestimate 
the 
magnitude 
or 

impact of this disease early on. Third, 

the medical field needs to be able to 

mobilize faster against an outbreak. 

Hospitals that are filling up with 

patients are understaffed and low on 

equipment, so there needs to be some 

sort of rapid development in medical 

infrastructure and production in order 

to keep up with disease. Such funding 

could come from a federal relief 

package. Whether that be converting 

factories to produce necessary goods 

and PPE or building new hospitals, 

these 
developments 
ought 
to 
be 

subsidized or otherwise incentivized 

by the government. The coronavirus 

will undoubtedly leave its mark on the 

population but what is important is 

how we handle the situation. We need 

to balance people’s livelihoods, the 

economy and public health in just the 

right way in order to avoid ruin, and it’s 

time to start having that conversation.

In 2013, at the end of a family trip to Europe, 

my family had the chance to watch “Mamma 

Mia!” in London’s West End (the Broadway of 

England). Watching a group of talented actors 

dance across the stage while singing ABBA’s 

greatest hits was a great way to cap off what had 

already been an amazing trip. A few days after 

returning home, my family sat down to watch 

the 2008 film adaptation for the first time, still 

high off of the incredible performance we had 

seen in London less than a week prior. After 

the live performance we had just seen, it was 

disappointing — to say the least.

Though this experience was more memorable 

given that we had just seen the show live, this 

was not the first time I’d been disappointed by a 

movie musical. It was consistent with something 

I’ve noticed: As a musical transitions from the 

stage to the screen, the material loses its magic. I 

should clarify that I’m not talking about animated 

musicals or musicals that are specifically made 

for movies, or movies that have been adapted 

into musicals (such as “Mean Girls,” “Amélie” 

and “Beetlejuice,” to name a few). Instead, I want 

to talk specifically about the mistakes that are 

made during the transition to the screen.

Creating movies based on musicals has 

historically served as a way to capitalize on the 

commercial success of the theater by dispensing 

it to a larger, more widespread audience. That 

way, you don’t have to go to New York to see a 

Broadway play, but can instead watch a facsimile 

of it from the comfort of your own living room. 

In the case of “Mamma Mia!,” the show has been 

touring internationally since 1999, so it makes 

sense that they used that momentum to adapt it 

into a film (and a sequel, but I’m not even going to 

touch on that). The problem, though, with stage-

to-screen musicals is that there is so much that 

can go wrong in the adaptation process.

The first mistake that movie musicals always 

make is their casting choices. Attempts to take 

advantage of the buzz that comes from casting 

big-name actors usually leads to a major pitfall: 

They can’t sing. Take “Mamma Mia!” as an 

example, a film so chock-full of famous actors 

that it has eight cast members with above-

title billing, but few that can sing well. Pierce 

Brosnan (“Die Another Day”) with his cringe-

worthy crooning is probably the worst offender; 

his time portraying James Bond in the late ’90s 

did nothing to prepare him for singing ABBA 

songs, and he even took home a Razzie for worst 

supporting actor. Another example of this is 

the 2012 adaptation of “Les Misérables,” which 

featured a very talented cast and proudly boasted 

the “unique” trait of having their actors sing live 

during filming, but was occasionally spoiled by 

shoddy vocal performances. Most old movie 

musicals, such as the 1961 adaptation of “West 

Side Story,” avoided poor performances entirely 

by dubbing in vocal performers for their stars, 

but made the musical experience less authentic 

in the process. 

One of the biggest differences between film and 

theater is the possibilities. Theater productions 

are limited in terms of physical space, economic 

means and the constraints of time, whereas 

film can travel between locations or create 

elaborate dream sequences with relative ease. 

This distinction can ruin the effects that theater 

musicals carefully design and implement. A good 

example of this is the recent and well-criticized 

adaptation of “Cats.” I never saw “Cats,” partially 

because of the negative press and partially 

because when I asked my friend about the film, 

the word he used to describe it was “terrifying.” 

Even as a musical, “Cats” is a bit hard to swallow, 

with the confusing storyline, strange music and 

the presence of anthropomorphic cats dancing 

across the stage. When you put it on screen, it 

transitions from captivatingly strange into just 

plain weird. One of the few things that makes 

“Cats” work as a musical is that the costumes are 

designed not to look like actual cats, but instead 

something else entirely. In order to demonstrate 

the technological prowess of modern technology, 

the film chose to use CGI instead of costumes, 

but by making the cats more “realistic” they just 

made them more bizarre.

The biggest issue, however, from the transition 

to the screen is losing the magic of the theater. 

This is harder to explain, but there is something 

special about live performances that puts you in 

another world, where bursting into spontaneous 

song and coordinated dance seems normal. 

As soon as you put that on screen, the musical 

shifts from playful ostentation to something a bit 

more uncomfortable. In film form, background 

singers and dancers feel awkward and out of 

place. Ballads in particular look strange because 

the actors are just standing there, singing to 

themselves or another actor rather than singing 

to the audience, as they would in the theater. 

In other words, a lot of what is missing is the 

audience, a key part of a live performance, 

and film adaptations must try to recreate this 

experience while being limited by a true fourth 

wall. 

That said, some movie musicals are incredibly 

effective. “Singin’ in the Rain,” for example, 

is one of my favorite movies and one of the 

best-ever movie musicals. The combination 

of expertly choreographed dancing, catchy 

music and an incredibly talented cast make it an 

effortlessly charming and timeless film. “The 

Sound of Music” is one that made the transition 

from stage to screen skillfully, aided mainly by 

Julie Andrews (“Mary Poppins”), whose film 

career was preceded by an exemplary career on 

Broadway. “Hairspray,” the 1988 film that was 

adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical, was 

adapted back to film as a very successful movie 

musical. The 2007 adaptation does everything 

that “Mamma Mia!” could not, finding big-name 

actors (Queen Latifah! Christopher Walken! Post-

“HSM” Zac Efron!) that could put up excellent 

performances and still carry a tune, and ways to 

help the transitions into song feel natural.

There is no such thing as a perfect movie 

musical, and there are few excellent ones. A lot 

of a musical film’s quality will depend on the 

casting, which should find a balance between 

actors that will bring talent to the film and those 

that will bring attention. Part of it depends on 

the material that they are given, but even then 

things might not fall into place if the direction 

or production is shaky. But there is no denying 

that movie musicals are always entertaining, 

even if they aren’t excellent. There is always a 

charm that goes along with losing yourself in 

flashy dancing or seeing a familiar face burst into 

song (or try to). You can bet that when the “In the 

Heights” adaptation and the “West Side Story” 

remake come out later this year, the theaters 

will be full of people excited to see their favorite 

musicals come to life in a new way on the screen. 

And you can bet that I’ll be in the audience, 

probably trying hard not to sing along.

Why movie musicals never seem to hit the right notes

FILM NOTEBOOK

Sufjan Stevens is one of the most fascinating 

artists working today. His life story contributes 

to one part of this enthrallment (an aspect 

that most fans are particularly attuned to). He 

consistently addresses personal experiences in 

his work, whether it’s through direct storytelling 

or atmospheric anecdotes about the places he’s 

lived. 
Even 
more 

intriguing 
is 
his 

position within the 

music industry and 

broader pop culture. 

Stevens 
has 
been 

able to hold true to 

his ambitions while 

maintaining an image 

in the mainstream. 

This 
is 
the 
man 

who 
collaborated 

on an experimental 

composition about the 

planets in the same year that he was nominated 

for an Oscar. Most fans know him only as an indie 

folk artist who dips his toes into alternative and 

electronic textures (his 2010 album The Age of 

Adz probably being the best known example). 

In reality, he is just as much an experimentalist 

as he is a folk artist. With new album Aporia, 

he works alongside Asthmatic Kitty Records 

co-founder Lowell Brams to make this distinction 

abundantly clear.

Aporia is a departure from Stevens’s previous 

records. The closest comparison would be 2001’s 

Enjoy Your Rabbit, which blends experimental 

electronics with organic instrumentation. Aporia 

takes Stevens’s familiar natural orchestration 

and throws it out the window in favor of a true 

electronic sound. For the most part, the album 

is heavily influenced by new age music (though 

I wouldn’t call it a new age record, because it 

takes inspiration from ambient music). Aporia 

really can’t be called 

anything 
other 
than 

an electronic album. 

Artists like Steve Roach 

and Oneohtrix Point 

Never 
(particularly 

in his earlier work) 

appear to have had 

major influences on the 

texture and structure of 

the music. The biggest 

surprise on the record, 

however, is the relative 

lack of singing. We don’t 

hear Stevens’s voice until 18 songs deep into the 

album. With all this said, Aporia is not a complete 

departure for Stevens, as a lot of his melodic 

tendencies are still very much present. The tools 

and sounds used to achieve melodic structure are 

what’s new.

A large reason for this is Brams, who has been 

making experimental electronic music since the 

’80s. His experience really shows on this record. 

He clearly constructs the atmospheric side of the 

record, which provides the perfect foundation 

for Stevens to build up more dynamic sounds. 

Brams maintains a level of restraint in the music 

that indicates an unparalleled degree of maturity. 

In a way, he acts as a guide for Stevens’s more 

ambitious ideas. This type of mentorship role 

isn’t all that surprising when you realize that 

Brams is Stevens’s stepfather. Yes, this is the 

same Lowell referenced in Stevens’s critically 

acclaimed 2015 album Carrie and Lowell. The two 

actually founded their record label Asthmatic 

Kitty together back in 1998. In fact, it wouldn’t be 

that far-fetched to imagine that Brams was the 

one who got Stevens into experimental electronic 

music in the first place — just another reason why 

their chemistry is so captivating on Aporia.

There are many who would argue that context 

should not affect how we think about music, but 

it’s instances like this that suggest the contrary. 

Knowledge of the relationship between Stevens 

and Lowell adds an intimate, beautiful harmony 

to the listening experience. Throughout Aporia, 

one gets a sense of their dynamic. Neither of 

them are simply going through the motions. 

There is a deep love for the sound that they are 

crafting, which adds a level of emotion that is 

often missing from electronic records. In a day 

and age when collaborations have become highly 

commercialized, Aporia is a breath of fresh 

air from the sterility of the industry method, 

demonstrating the power of an authentic 

collaboration.

Learning to live with intent
 through West African dance 

PHOTO ESSAY

PAULINE RAJSKI

Staff Photographer

As crowds of students 

rush from one class to the 
next, eat in dining halls 
in the next building, and 
run hard on treadmills only 
several feet away, a unique form of energy 
is unleashed in Studio B of the dance building. 
As a freshman, I had no idea the dance building 
had existed until I signed up for West African Dance 
this semester with Imani Ma’at AnkhmenRa Amen and 
Marwan Amen-Ra.

The first thing that Imani emphasized to our class was the 

connection between our dancing and the music. Before this class, I had 
very little experience dancing to live music. The moment class starts 
and Marwain begins beating on the drum, the classroom is transformed.

We were quickly taught of the power of ase. It was described as an 

energy, a frequency, a spiritual connection of sorts. It is that moment 
when you are thinking of someone just for them to call you seconds 
later. In class, the idea of unity and connections between individuals is 
emphasized daily. It makes it difficult to believe that hatred and violence 
can exist when we are embraced in so much kindness, joy, and passion. 

We start each practice by honoring our greatest muscle - the heart. 

As the warm energy created by the friction in our hands is transferred 
back into our hearts, we are reminded of the importance of remaining 
present. This space allows us to do just that. We are completely 
immersed in ourselves. I become aware of every joint, muscle, and 
blood flow within my body. Energy appears to course through me 
without end.

Imani reminds us that we all have something to be grateful for each 

day. I am a skeptic, I will admit it. I want to believe in the energy around 
me, the concept of a rites of passage, and that our ancestors exist to 
protect and guide us. However, I am also an engineer. Throughout my 
life I have had an internal conflict between my passion for science and 
mathematics and my spirituality. Yet, Imani made a strong point. All 
energy is conserved. It is never created. There is an energy that exists 
beyond our limp corpses. Once we become aware of it, we stop existing 
and we begin living.

As we dance, Imani constantly asks us what our intentions are. In 

life, everything we do should have a purpose. When we start living with 
intention, we grow happier. This can occur in the smallest of forms, 
such as when we pick out cereal for breakfast. When we start living 
with intent, we gain a deeper sense of ourselves and our energy.

Through this class, I have learned a small fraction of the rich culture 

in Western Africa. Dances including Kuku, Soli, Sunu, and Sinte. The 
history of people is embedded into the moves we practice in class. 
The most amazing part of the class is the atmosphere that is cultivated. 
I know every time I enter Dance Studio B I am not judged. All of my 
worries fly out the window as I let my body flow freely. This class 
continues to teach me something new each week. Everyone is welcome 
and encouraged to join.

Each class ends through the honoring of the drum as is tradition in 

West African dance. This class has been my favorite one taken at the 
University of Michigan. I highly recommend every person experience 
this class at least once during their studies here.

Imani Ma’at AnkhmenRa Amen dances happily with her students.

We end our class by honoring the drums out of respect.
Dylan Sivin embraces all of herself through dance.

Joe Milton is not a subtle 

quarterback.

He stands 6-foot-5 and 

dominates the room, the 

talent 
evident 
from 
his 

frame. He said two years ago 

— before ever stepping on 

the field at Michigan — that 

he once threw a football 85 

yards, and it felt believable. 

The phrase “arm talent” was 

made to describe someone of 

his ilk.

Then there is the rest 

of the package. Milton’s 

completion percentage didn’t 

rise above 50 throughout 

his time in high school. He 

throws with so much zip 

that it’s a problem — he said 

in the fall that his receivers 

would leave the field with 

dislocated fingers in high 

school. Nearly every time 

his name is mentioned, it is 

said that he needs to work on 

touch and accuracy. Those 

two things generally don’t 

threaten to derail the career 

of someone with as much 

talent as Milton before he 

even starts a game, but it 

remains to be seen whether 

they will prevent him from 

reaching his ceiling.

“There’s 
different 
ball 

flights, different appropriate 

throws,” 
Michigan 
coach 

Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
last 

season. “Not everything is 

a line drive fastball. There’s 

gotta be a lot of elevation … 

to make a catchable ball for a 

runner. Joe’s responded and 

is really working on it. It’s 

not an easy thing to do.”

All of this adds up to 

Milton 
being 
perhaps 

Michigan’s most interesting 

player in a pivotal offseason 

where it’s unclear when 

the next practice will be 

conducted. He’ll have the 

chance to compete with 

redshirt 
junior 
Dylan 

McCaffrey for the starting 

job, but comes in as the 

underdog, as McCaffrey has 

an extra year of experience 

and has been ahead of Milton 

on the depth chart for the 

last two seasons. The lack of 

spring practice, too, favors 

the safer option — which is 

decidedly McCaffrey.

Still, 
Milton’s 
ceiling 

makes it impossible to count 

him out.

The Daily went back and 

analyzed each player’s 2019 

season, focusing on Milton 

in this piece.

What 
we’ve 
seen 
is 

better than what we’ve 

heard

We haven’t seen much. 

Milton 
has 
11 
passing 

attempts and 12 rushing 

attempts over eight games 

in two years of college. Two 

of his three spring games 

have been canceled — one for 

weather and this year’s over 

COVID-19 concerns — and 

the one in which he played 

was more an open practice 

than 
an 
actual 
game. 

Anything 
we 
extrapolate 

from Milton’s tape should be 

taken with a grain of salt.

Still, it’s easy to hear about 

Milton’s 
accuracy 
issues, 

then conjure up an image 

of Christian Hackenberg-

lite, players on the sideline 

ducking for cover because the 

throws are so wild. Though 

no one with Michigan has 

ever spoken negatively about 

Milton 
in 
public, 
praise 

usually comes in a guarded 

tone when asked about him. 

Milton’s own availabilities 

have the same tone — it’s 

about what he’s working 

on more than what he’s 

done. The operative tense 

is the future, the allure is 

possibility.

When asked how he’d 

improved at the Citrus Bowl, 

Milton said, “Touch, not 

throwing the ball too hard 

at people. And putting it over 

the top so people can go get 

it instead of just throwing it 

and watching people run full 

speed.”

In game reps, though, 

we’ve seen him display that 

touch. When Milton got 

in during garbage time of 

Michigan’s win over Rutgers, 

he piloted a touchdown drive 

with deft control. Here, he 

stands in the pocket, sees 

Giles Jackson come open on 

a corner route and lofts one 

right into his path.

In last year’s spring game, 

he made what’s probably 

the best throw we’ve seen 

from him at Michigan. With 

Erick All darting down the 

sideline with a defender 

draped on him, Milton is 

forced to throw into a tight 

window of space, navigating 

the defender, All and the 

boundary. 
He 
drops 
it 

perfectly into that window, 

finding a spot where only All 

can catch it, with no worries 

about getting his feet down 

inbounds.

These are the kinds of 

throws that make Milton’s 

ceiling 
worth 
talking 

about. Not many college 

quarterbacks can do things 

like that. Fewer still can do 

it consistently, and based off 

both the limited reps we’ve 

seen and everything that’s 

been said about Milton, he 

isn’t in that category yet.

He’s not a developed 

product

As 
far 
as 
Milton’s 

chances of starting in the 

fall go, rendering the above 

statement false is the most 

important thing he can do. 

Michigan, despite a relative 

lack of hype, is a team that 

can win 10 or more games 

in 2020 if it gets steady 

quarterback 
play. 
The 

Wolverines are deep at skill 

positions, they’re in year 

two of Josh Gattis’ offense 

and have the offensive line 

depth to withstand turnover. 

Starting someone with as 

much variability as Milton is 

a pretty serious risk.

That’s 
not 
just 
a 

commentary on accuracy. 

In this play from last year’s 

spring game, Milton’s pocket 

presence isn’t up to snuff. 

Because of the camera angle, 

we can’t tell if any of his 

receivers are open, but this 

is a spot where Milton needs 

to sense the pressure and get 

out of the pocket. Instead, 

he seems not to notice 

the pocket collapsing as 

linebacker Jordan Glasgow 

drives 
offensive 
lineman 

Chuck Filiaga into him.

But the accuracy remains a 

problem. In the spring game, 

Milton 
badly 
overthrew 

open receivers twice, both 

times preventing a potential 

explosive play.

Around Michigan football, 

this year’s mid-offseason lull 

carries a different feel than 

the past two. For one, 2018 and 

2019 both had a spring season, 

giving 
the 
Wolverines 
15 

practices to answer questions 

slightly less pressing than 

“Will we play the season?” But 

there was also an entrenched 

starter at quarterback, even if 

Jim Harbaugh wouldn’t admit 

it.

Now, with Shea Patterson 

graduated, there’s a gaping 

hole in the middle of a 

Michigan offense that returns 

many 
of 
its 
surrounding 

playmakers. At the center of 

the competition to fill that 

void are redshirt junior Dylan 

McCaffrey 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore Joe Milton.

While McCaffrey possesses 

an extra year of experience 

and three times as many pass 

attempts in relief of Patterson 

— despite missing time in 

both the past two seasons 

due to injury — Milton’s 

generational arm talent gives 

him 
a 
tantalizing 
ceiling 

that Harbaugh and offensive 

coordinator Josh Gattis will 

attempt to harness in 2020.

But without a spring season 

to separate the two, all we 

have is the tape, consisting of 

35 pass attempts and 23 rush 

attempts for McCaffrey, and 

11 pass attempts and 12 rush 

attempts for Milton.

The Daily went back and 

analyzed each player’s play in 

2019, focusing on McCaffrey 

in this piece. 

McCaffrey 
operates 

excellently in Gattis’s read-

heavy offense

This was evident from 

the first snap of McCaffrey’s 

season — a 10-yard carry 

against 
Middle 
Tennessee 

State. (He was in as a receiver a 

few drives earlier, but one can 

only assume Gattis has burned 

that page of his playbook.)

McCaffrey’s speed has been 

widely recited as his biggest 

advantage over Patterson, but 

Patterson was plenty mobile 

when he got the ball in space. 

His biggest problem was an 

inability to make the correct 

reads on the zone reads that 

make up the bulk of Gattis’s 

run game — especially during 

the first half of the season, 

when he was hampered by an 

oblique injury.

In 2019, that wasn’t a 

problem for McCaffrey. He 

repeatedly made the correct 

reads 
in 
the 
run 
game, 

whether on speed options or 

zone reads, helping himself to 

67 yards on 13 carries on the 

season while also opening up 

lanes for Michigan’s running 

backs by keeping defenses 

honest.

Here, McCaffrey keeps his 

eyes on the defense as Ben 

VanSumeren comes to take 

the handoff. He sees the weak-

side linebacker collapsing in to 

defend the handoff and moves 

his eyes toward the weak-

side defensive end. When 

McCaffrey is at his mesh point, 

he sees the defensive end take 

a shuffle step inside. That’s 

all McCaffrey needs to see to 

realize that he has a walk-in 

touchdown if he pulls the ball 

and takes it himself.

McCaffrey’s 
ability 
to 

make the most of the options 

provided by Gattis’s offense 

isn’t limited to the running 

game.

On this run-pass option 

later in the same game, he 

sees the middle linebacker and 

strong-side linebacker both 

pinching in before the mesh 

point, leaving Ronnie Bell 

in one-on-one coverage on a 

slant route over the middle. 

McCaffrey overthrows Bell, 

but 
forces 
the 
defensive 

back into a tough position by 

making the right read. This 

gives Bell the chance to draw a 

defensive holding penalty and 

get the first down.

He’s 
susceptible 
to 

zeroing in and missing open 

receivers 

While 
McCaffrey 
had 

excellent 
decision-making 

on zone reads and RPOs, he 

occasionally struggled to find 

open receivers, instead zeroing 

in on covered ones. On more 

than a few occasions, this led 

to him failing to convert on 

opportunities for significant 

yardage.

McCaffrey, 
though, 

has 
escaped 
the 
worst 

implications of questionable 

decision-making. In his two 

years at Michigan, he has 

yet to throw an interception 

on 35 pass attempts. But 

with 
significantly 
more 

— and higher-leverage — 

opportunities 
in 
store 
in 

2020, he’ll have to work on 

going through his reads to 

outdo Patterson’s stellar 2.12 

interception percentage over 

the past two seasons.

Here, McCaffrey is lucky to 

avoid a red-zone interception. 

The primary read on the play 

is tight end Sean McKeon 

on a crossing route off play-

action. 
Against 
one-deep 

man 
coverage, 
this 
route 

would normally be difficult to 

defend, especially after both 

outside linebackers initially 

pinch in off the play action. 

But McCaffrey zeroes in on 

McKeon early, allowing the 

weak-side outside linebacker to 

drop into the path of McKeon’s 

route and nearly come away 

with the interception.

While that play did come 

in the fifth and final game 

McCaffrey threw a pass in, this 

is an area in which he improved 

throughout the season. Earlier 

in the same drive against 

Maryland, McCaffrey helped 

the Wolverines get into field-

goal range with this excellent 

play to convert on third down.

Facing a third-and-10 from 

the Maryland 43, McCaffrey 

knows he needs a first down 

here to keep the drive alive. 

With Mike Sainristil, Bell and 

Erick All running deep routes 

beyond the first-down marker, 

McCaffrey goes through his 

progressions. But rather than 

forcing a dangerous throw 

into one of them, he instead 

finds Tarik Black open on the 

crossing route, after locking 

his eyes in on McKeon for a 

split-second — long enough to 

freeze the middle linebacker, 

giving Black the separation 

he needs to pick up the first 

down.

This is the type of play 

McCaffrey didn’t make as 

often as he would have liked 

early in the 2019 season, but it’s 

an area that will be critical to 

his success in 2020 as he aims 

to make the most of Michigan’s 

returning weapons.

Isaiah Livers to test NBA Draft waters with ‘open book’ mindset

On the heels of a season that 

saw Isaiah Livers earn an All-

Big Ten honorable mention 

selection, the junior forward 

announced he will enter his 

name into the NBA Draft on 

Monday.

While 
Livers 
didn’t 

announce the decision until 

Monday, he told reporters 

on a teleconference that he 

made up his mind before the 

season even began. He will 

not hire an agent at this time, 

and instead will “seek advice 

from multiple individuals,” 

leaving open the option of 

returning to school, according 

to a Michigan spokesperson. 

NCAA rules allow him 

to retain his eligibility if 

he 
chooses, 
provided 
he 

terminates the relationship 

with 
any 
agent 
he 
may 

encounter during the process. 

Additionally, he is permitted 

to return to the Wolverines 

if he participates in the NBA 

combine and goes undrafted.

“Following the cancellation 

of the season, my family and 

our coaching staff have had 

several discussions on my 

future as a basketball player,” 

Livers said in a statement. 

“After much reflection and 

prayer, I have decided to 

enter my name into the 2020 

NBA Draft and start the 

full evaluation process. The 

University of Michigan has 

done so much for me and 

helped me get to a position 

where I might be able to reach 

my goal of playing professional 

basketball.”

Livers was tied as the 

team’s leading scorer this 

past season, averaging 12.9 

points on 45 percent shooting 

across 
31.5 
minutes 
per 

game. He missed 10 games 

due to injury, but emerged 

as the Wolverines’ offensive 

focal point when healthy in 

November and February.

At this point, he has yet 

to make a final decision on 

whether he will return for his 

senior season.

“I want to keep both 

doors open,” Livers said in 

a 
teleconference 
Monday. 

“I want the door to keep 

my name in the draft or the 

door to keep my eligibility. I 

definitely want the option to 

keep my eligibility because 

if things don’t work out, and 

say I need another year of 

school, I don’t have a problem 

with it. It’s successful either 

way because I could get my 

education and my diploma and 

then declare for the draft next 

year, or if they like what they 

see right now, I can keep my 

name in the draft. It’s good to 

have two options.”

Livers made a point of 

emphasizing that he is not 

leaning one way or another, 

referring to himself as an 

“open book.” He feels he’d 

fit in well alongside the 

Wolverines’ 
fourth-ranked 

incoming recruiting class if 

he remains in college, though 

it’s fair to wonder how such 

additions, coupled with the 

potential return of much-

improved 
freshman 
wing 

Franz Wagner, would clash 

with his own catch-and-shoot 

prowess.

With an uncertain couple 

of weeks on deck, Livers plans 

to lean on Michigan coach 

Juwan Howard, who played 

19 seasons in the NBA.

“Coach Howard, being the 

guy he is, he’s not trying to 

kick me out of here or trap 

me here,” Livers said. “He’s 

more about, ‘What’s the best 

opportunity for me?’ That was 

one of the first phone calls 

we’ve ever had between me 

and him, when he first took 

the job. He was always going to 

put me in the best opportunity 

for me to be the best person 

I can be to get to my dreams 

that I want to get to. Definitely 

more of him being the mentor 

factor, not only my coach.

“… (Howard) knows how 

the NBA works. He’ll know 

if I’m prepared or not by 

the feedback that he’ll get. 

I’m taking his feedback 100 

percent.”

With 
the 
NBA 
season 

currently 
suspended, 

however, questions about the 

draft process itself remain 

unanswered. 
Without 
the 

chance to showcase his game 

in the NCAA Tournament, 

Livers would benefit from a 

chance to boost his stock at 

the combine or individual 

team workouts leading up to 

June, but it’s unclear whether 

that will be possible amid the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

So 
far, 
he’s 
contacted 

former 
teammates 
Jordan 

Poole, 
Charles 
Matthews 

and 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
to 

discuss the process. Despite 

the uncertainty, his decision 

to test the waters will at 

minimum allow him to get 

feedback from coaches and 

scouts at the next level.

For now, whether or not he 

decides to pull the trigger on 

making the jump to that level 

remains to be seen.

Breaking down Michigan hockey’s incoming freshman class

When Mel Pearson was 

hired after Red Berenson’s 

retirement three years ago, 

the Michigan hockey program 

was in a transitional state.

Recruiting 
in 
hockey 

happens years in advance 

of 
when 
players 
show 

up 
on 
campus, 
so 
as 

Berenson 
headed 
toward 

retirement, recruits became 

more 
and 
more 
cautious 

about 
committing 
to 
the 

Wolverines. 
In 
Pearson’s 

first year, the freshman class 

included Quinn Hughes and 

Josh Norris, both of whom 

were first-round NHL draft 

picks and have gone on to 

successful 
professional 

careers — but that was the 

exception, not the norm.

In the fall of 2018, Pearson 

brought in a 10-player class, 

but not one of them was an 

NHL draft choice. There 

was some talent in the group 

and most of them have found 

success at Michigan, but the 

class was a bit of a question 

mark coming in.

This past fall, Pearson’s 

reputation 
for 
high-level 

recruiting started to come to 

fruition. He brought in two 

first-round NHL draft picks 

in Cam York and Johnny 

Beecher, along with Nick 

Granowicz, who scored seven 

goals in year one. The other 

members of the class — Eric 

Ciccolini and Keaton Pehrson 

— should be key contributors 

in the coming years.

Now, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

incoming class for the 2020-

21 season is one of the best in 

college hockey.

“If you go down the list of 

players we have coming in, 

we’re really excited about this 

group,” Pearson said. “(We) 

feel they’re really gonna fit in 

and plug some of the holes we 

lost by losing nine pretty good 

seniors. And we’re gonna 

need that. We’re gonna need 

those guys to come in and 

contribute right away.”

The Daily breaks down 

some of the key pieces of the 

class and the biggest names to 

know going forward.

Forwards

Thomas 
Bordeleau 

(U.S. 
National 
Team 

Development Program)

Michigan’s 
senior 
class 

contributed 37.8 percent of its 

offense last year, so, needless 

to say, there are some serious 

holes to fill up front in the 

coming year. Bordeleau led 

the NTDP in scoring with 

16 goals and 30 assists for a 

total of 46 points in 47 games 

and projects as a late first or 

early second pick in the 2020 

draft. He’s played center for 

the NTDP, but at 5-foot-9, he’s 

a little small to play center 

in the Big Ten — especially 

on a team loaded with talent 

down the middle — so he 

may slide to the wing for the 

Wolverines. 

Brendan 
Brisson 

(Chicago Steel, USHL)

Brisson’s 
Chicago 
Steel 

team was essentially a super-

team in the USHL, so take 

his numbers with a grain 

of salt, but he’s clearly got 

some offensive talent. He 

finished second in the USHL 

in scoring with 59 points in 45 

games. Brisson’s performance 

this year, particularly at the 

World Junior A Challenge, 

has put him solidly in the first 

round in most mock drafts. As 

the Wolverines lost more than 

a third of their offense, his 

scoring touch will be called 

upon right away when he hits 

the ice in the fall.

Kent 
Johnson 
(Trail 

Smoke Eaters, BCHL)

Johnson has spent the last 

two years playing underage 

in junior hockey. Because he 

doesn’t turn 18 until October, 

he is not draft-eligible in 2020 

but is projected as a top-5 or 

top-10 pick in the 2021 draft. 

Though he’s a year or two 

younger than most of the 

BCHL players, Johnson put 

up 101 points — 41 goals and 

60 assists — through 52 games 

to win the BCHL scoring title 

by a full 30 points. The BCHL 

is known as an offensive 

league, but just below two 

points per game is still close 

to unheard of. Once again, 

with the offense Michigan 

lost, the Wolverines will look 

to Johnson’s scoring ability to 

fill the gaps. 

Philippe Lapointe (Trail 

Smoke Eaters, BCHL)

Lapointe 
missed 
the 

beginning of Trail’s season 

with an injury and still put 

up 55 points in 36 games 

once he returned — good for 

second in the BCHL in points 

per game. Again, the BCHL 

is an offensive league, so his 

numbers may be a bit inflated 

from both that and playing 

on Johnson’s wing, but he 

looks like a solid third-line 

winger with a decent amount 

of offensive upside. Lapointe 

is also one of the older players 

in the class at 20, and that 

additional game experience 

is valuable when making the 

leap to college hockey.

Defensemen

Owen Power (Chicago 

Steel, USHL)

Like Johnson, Power is 

coming to Michigan in his 

draft year after two seasons 

of junior hockey. And like 

Johnson, Power is currently 

projecting as a top-10 — if not 

top-5 — pick in the 2021 draft. 

He led USHL defensemen 

in scoring with 40 points 

in 45 games, and at 6-foot-

5 is an imposing presence 

on the blueline. With Luke 

Martin and Griffin Luce both 

graduating, the Wolverines 

only have one defenseman 

— Pehrson — above 6-foot, 

so Power’s size, in addition 

to his elite-level skill, makes 

him even more important for 

Michigan.

Jacob 
Truscott 
(U.S. 

NTDP)

While 
Power 
is 
the 

model of a modern two-way 

defenseman that can both 

drive play and sit back and 

defend, Truscott is more 

known 
for 
his 
defensive 

game. He can contribute a 

fair amount offensively — 

his 21 points in 47 games 

ranked second on the NTDP 

for defensemen — but his 

defensive mindset will be key 

as he joins a young group of 

blueliners. The Wolverines 

are losing two stay-at-home 

blueliners in Martin and 

Luce, so the addition of 

Truscott is important for a 

group that’s mostly made up 

of puck movers.

Goaltender

Erik Portillo (Dubuque 

Fighting Saints, USHL)

Portillo was the third-

round pick of the Buffalo 

Sabres in the 2019 NHL 

Draft and was a member of 

Sweden’s team at the 2020 

World Juniors. For Dubuque, 

he finished fourth in the 

USHL in save percentage 

at .915 and had the second-

best goals against average at 

2.11 goals per game. He’s tall 

— standing 6-foot-6 — and 

fits the physical model of a 

modern NHL netminder.

Michigan 
found 
its 

goaltender this season in 

sophomore 
Strauss 
Mann, 

who finished second in the 

nation in save percentage at 

.939 and had the sixth-best 

goals against average at 1.85 

goals per game. Both markers 

set single-season records for 

the Wolverines. But he won’t 

be around forever, and adding 

Portillo two years behind him 

in the pipeline sets Michigan 

up for continued success in 

net.
