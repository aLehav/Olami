Bargaining breaks
down in shadow of
right-to-work law
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
With right-to-work legislation
that severely limits the ability of
unions in Michigan to organize
within workplaces coming into
effect on March 28, members of
the Graduate Employees' Orga-
nization decided to walk away
from negotiations with the Uni-
versity after claiming the Univer-
sity's bargaining team wouldn't
budge on its proposed salary
cuts. Instead, the union will take
its chances bargaining next year
when members have the option
not to pay dues under the law.
GEO, which represents gradu-
ate student instructors and grad-
uate student staff assistants at
the three University campuses,
and the University had been
negotiating every day this week
in the hopes of agreeing upon a
three-year contract to circum-
vent the effects of right-to-work
until 2016. GEO's current con-
tract expires in March 2014.
Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, GEO spokesperson,
said the deal being offered by
the University didn't meet its

requirements.
"GEO members have - from
the beginning of this pro-
cess - been making decisions
about what our bottom line is,"
Rodrigues said. "We had set
bottom lines in terms of salary,
in terms of our childcare agree-
ment, and we have always said
if these bottom lines are crossed
we will walk away."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald the University made no
decisiontoleavethebargainingtable.
"My understanding is it was
GEO's decision," Fitzgerald said.
"They have a current contract in
place."
GEO president Katie Frank
said in a statement that GEO's
bargaining team was willing to
make compromises.
"Inthewordsoftheirbargaining
team, we made a 'herculean effort'
to move toward their proposals,"
Frank said. "We were willing to
make huge sacrifices to protect our
contract in a state attacking collec-
tive bargaining rights."
Rodrigues said the Univer-
sity's proposal to add another
"fraction" to the designations of
GSIs and GSSAs' pay was irrec-
oncilable. Because GSIs and
GSSAs don't necessarily work
full time, their salaries are deter-
mined by a range of "fractions" of
full time they work.

Administrators
working to educate
students on
staying safe
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
This weekend, fans of maize
and blue will be seeing a lot of
green - and alcohol.
University and city officials
are promoting a "Stay in the
Blue" campaign, advocating
responsible drinking for the hol-
iday weekend.

The University will be host-
ing several events over the
weekend, including the Honors
Convocation, cheering on the
Michigan Basketball team in
the Big Ten Conference Tourna-
ment and St. Patrick's Day fes-
tivities.
Sarah Daniels, assistant dean
of students, said the Division of
Student Affairs is partnering
with student groups to make
sure there would be no con-
flicts for visitors during the busy
weekend.
"In anticipating there will
be a lot of external guests on
campus, we want to make sure
we have a robust weekend with

positive messages out there
for how students can celebrate
appropriately with events that
are alternatives to what people
may consider as things to do this
weekend - alternative events on
campus this weekend that are
safe and fun," Daniels said.
Joy Pehlke, a Alcohol and
Other Drug health educator
with the University Health Ser-
vice, said the student-driven
safety campaign was launched
for the first night football game
against Notre Dame last year. A
similar program for the St. Pat-
rick's Day weekend aims to pro-
duce the same result.
"Part of the efforts we did

then to really reduce harm were
not only the events that were
going on but some of the out-
reach - outreach with the bars
and restaurants, specifically on
State Street and closer to cam-
pus, and educate them on how to
'Stay in the Blue'," Pehlke said.
Pehlke said the groups passed
out 10,000 "Stay in the Blue"
coasters to bars and restaurants
along with a letter signed by a
nuinber of University officials'
supporting the effort to monitor
alcohol practices this weekend.
The letter asks the participating
sites to include non-alcoholic
specials, focus on serving food

SENATE ASSEMBLY
Faculty run for
spots on senate
advisory board

Eight candidates
competing for three
S open spots on SACUA
By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday, the Senate
Assembly will elect three Uni-
versity faculty members to fill
vacant positions on the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs for three-year terms.
The committee consists of nine
Senate Assembly members and
holds weekly meetings to discuss
University policy and affairs.
Eight faculty members nomi-
nated by the Senate Assem-
bly are running for three
openings. Improved communi-
cation between faculty and stu-
dents, tuition affordability and
freedom of academic expression
were common topics the candi-
dates said they would be inter-
ested in pursuing if elected.
Joseph Custer, a professor in
pediatric diseases and communi-
cable diseases, was an alternate
member of the Senate Assembly
from 2008 to 2011 and became
an active member during 2012.
He was also on the Institutional
Review Board of the Massachu-
setts General Hospital and the
House Officer Selection Commit-
tee at Harvard Medical School in

the 1980s.
"I'm from the Medical School,
soit's a particularly unique point
of view," Custer said. "But I also
believe that, from a personal
standpoint, Iowe this University
something. I came here 25 years
ago from Harvard and this place
has been very kind to me, and
I've been injected and infected
with the Michigan vibrance, so
part of it is giving back."
Custer said he would like to
see faculty participate more in
handling University issues. He
also said transparency amongthe
administration, faculty and stu-
dents has been an ongoing issue
that needs to be addressed.
"When there are issues about
professional conduct or behav-
ior, the way faculty and students
are dealt with by the university
should be absolutely transpar-
ent," he said.
Avery Demond, an associ-
ate professor of civil and envi-
ronmental engineering, serves
on the Academic Affairs Advi-
sory Committee of the Senate
Assembly and is the director of
the Environmental and Water
Resources Engineering Program.
Demond said her position as
a female science faculty mem-
ber will carry on the legacies of
retiring SACUA members Kate
Barald, professor of biomedi-
cal engineering, and Kimberlee

Snyder picks

Bankruptcy
lawyer says he can

By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
On Thursday, Michigan's
emergency loan board approved
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
top pick for Detroit's emergency
financial manager in a unani-
mous 3-0 vote.
Snyder announced his choice,
bankruptcy Kevyn Orr, at a press
conference Thursday at Cadil-
lac Place in Detroit. The gov-
ernor said Orr, a partner at the
Jones Day law firm in Washing-
ton, D.C., fulfills the qualities
he looked for in an emergency
financial manager: strong inter-
personal skills, technical skills
and decision-making experience.
The state will pay Orr $275,000
to overhaul Detroit's deeplytrou-
bled finances.
Orr, a Michigan alum who
earned degrees from the college
of Literature, Science and the
Arts and the Law School, said he
will resign from his position at

Kearfott, professor of nuclear
engineering and radiological sci-
ence.
"We're female faculty who have
a long history in the University in
the sciences and engineering, so
I think they wanted to maintain
that perspective on SACUA and
that's why I was asked to run."
Demond said she wants to
expedite SACUA's process of han-
dling University affairs.
"I tend to be action-oriented,"
she said. "Sometimes I might be
dismayed at the pace at which
things moved. So, if anything, I'd
probably be the person who'd be
trying to push."
Goncalo Abecasis, the School
of Public Health's Felix E. Moore
Collegiate Professor of Biostatis-
tics, serves on many University
committees. Some of his positions
include Secretary of the Univer-
sity Advisory Committee and a
member of the Provost's Global
Challenges for a Third Century
Committee.
Abecasis said he cares deeply
about freedom of expression
among faculty and students and
wants to encourage interdisci-
plinary collaboration and innova-
tion.
"Sometimes I worry that peo-
ple are under a lot of pressure to
conform and to do what's stan-
dard in a particular field," he
said. "And my experience is when
you connect things across fields
and across disciplines, or bring
in approaches that are different
than standard, that's where you
see the big developments."
He would like to see a greater
representation of younger faculty
in SACUA.
Laura Olsen, the Arthur F.
Thurnau Professor of Molecular,
Cellular and Developmental Biol-
ogy; professor of ecology and evo-
lutionary biology; and the director
of the Undergraduate Program in
Biology, holds positions in many
University committees such as
the University Tenure Committee
and the Advisory Board on Inter-
collegiate Athletics.
Olsen said she wants to empha-
size tuition affordability and cost
as pertinent issues.
"Iwantto makesurethings like
affordability cotinue to be prom-
inent issues;" Olsen said. "I want
to make sure that benefits for all,
for undergraduates through staff
and faculty, continue to be impor-
tant issues for everyone."
Olsen also said the current
SACUA is successful in their
efforts to increase faculty aware-
ness and relations with the
administration.
"I think that they've worked
really hard to try to improve the
representation of the faculty,"
Olsen said. "I think that they've
tried hard to make sure that the
administration is working fairly
with the faculty. So I don't have
any current grievances or issues
that I would want to go in and fix."
Bob Ziff, a professor of chemi-
cal engineering, served as a mem-
ber of SACUA in 2012 and is the
Chairman of the College of Engi-
neering Library Committee.
Ziff said he would like to see an
increased role of faculty in Uni-
versity policy like tuition afford-
ability, student diversity and
freedom of academic expression.

"Affordability and diversity in
student body are very important
issues," Ziff said. "And another
important issue is maintaining
the quality and academic freedom
of the faculty."
Anne Mondro, an associate
professor in the School of Art &
Design, serves on the Committee
on University Values of the Senate
Assembly and the University Cre-
ative Arts and Dementia Commit-
tee, among others.
Mondro said her background in
the arts will bring a unique view-
point to SACUA.
"If elected, I intend to acknowl-
edge and support creative courses
and research," Mondro said.
Mondro also said diversity and
certain academic issues should be
addressed.
"Tackling diversity issues and
improving the academic climate
is vital," she said. "Protecting aca-
demic freedom, time for faculty
research, transparency for faculty
on university processes and sup-
porting various modes of inquiry
are also key topics.
Greek and Latin Prof. Sara
Ahbel-Rappe and John Mans-
field, an associate director of the
North Campus Electron Micro-
beam Analysis Laboratory, are
also running for the open SACUA
positions.

MANAGER

Jones Day in order to avoid any
suspicion of impropriety since
the firm performs services for
the city. In a meeting with the
emergency loan board, Orr said
he will move to Detroit and start
his job on March 25.
As his first order of busi-
ness, Orr plans to look at the
city's financial data with Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing, who also spoke
with Snyder and Orr at the press
conference. He said this initial
discussion will drive his deci-
sion-making process. Orr added
that he expects the daunting job
will be completed in 18 months.
In the position he will be able to
override some elected officials.
Snyder declared Detroit to
be in a state of financial emer-
gency on March 1 after accept-
ing a report produced by a team
of six members including state
treasurer Andy Dillon that
revealed that Detroit has $14 bil-
lion in long-term liabilities and a
$327-million yearly deficit.
As protesters surrounded
Cadillac Place during the press
conference, Snyder said the
emergency manager position
provides an opportunity for
Detroit to get back on its feet.
"I don't view this as an act
of isolation," Snyder said. "This
is not about asking one individ-
ual to come in and turn around
the city of Detroit ... This is
an opportunity for us to work
together and to bring people
together as Detroit, Michigan."
Orr said this moment repre-
sents "the Olympics of recon-
struction," and added that he
feels compelled to do this job to
help restore the city to which
he has such strong personal
ties. Orr specializes in corpo-
rate restructuring, bankruptcy,
litigation, appeals, and legal
recruiting and diversity at his

approximately 60 signatures.
The national branch of the orga-
nization has a fundraising goal of
$270,000 through the approxi-
mately 50 to 100 chapters at uni-
versities across the nation.
"I think most people just don't
know, and I can't guarantee that if
people know, they'll care, because
every day there are a million dif-
ferent things that people will tell
me I should care about," Hoey
said. "But the point is that maybe a
few people will, and those people
will become really strong advo-
cates and change a lot of lives.
That's really all we can ask for.
LSA senior Julia Santalucia
said she did a lot of planning
for the event after joining IJM
through friends at New Life
Church and developing an inter-
est in social justice. She added
that she didn't know that slav-
ery still existed until she joined

law firm. He previously helped
guide Chrysler through its 2009
bankruptcy proceedings.
Bing said he believes he and
Orr will work well together and
that, regardless of who the mayor
or city council members are,
Detroit's citizens deserve help.
"Because of the financial pres-
sures that we've been under,
we've not been able to give citi-
zens who pay the taxes the ser-
vices thatthey require," Bing said.
Between 2000 and 2012,
the city lost 200,000 residents.
Between 1970 and 2012, the
population decreased from 1.5
million to fewer than 700,000
people. The decline in popula-
tion has left Detroit with exten-
sive infrastructure, pension and
maintenance liabilities, but an
insufficient tax base to support
its obligations.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) was unavailable to speak
Thursday due to illness, but said
earlier this month that he believes
an emergency financial manager
is "a bad thing" for Detroit. He
added that most emergency man-
agers drive their respective cities
into further debt.
LSA senior Lauren Coffman,
the communications director
for the University's chapter of
the College Democrats, said the
appointment takes power out
of the hands of democratically
elected local officials.
"I think it's really important
for (Detroit citizens) to have that
autonomy to decide what's best
for them," Coffman said. "This
is a really important time for the
citizens of Detroit to mobilize
and make their voices heard in
whatever way they can."
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
chair of the University's chap-
ter of College Republicans, said
Wednesday an emergency finan-
cial manager would help Detroit
recover from its financial decline.
"We need someone who is
definitely serious about it, is
IJM.
"Social justice means working
to achieve the basic rights that
each human innately deserves,
like shelter, food, water, and to
not be exploited, which are often
not available to all humans,"
Santalucia said. "I also think it
has a lot to do with policy, which
is what we're doing today, it's
not just something you know,
it's something you do, and in this
case work to achieve."
Santalucia echoed Hoey's
sentiment that an advocate
should act as a "mediator of
change" for the people they help
instead of acting directly.
"It's not about barging in and
changingtheir culture and telling
them what to do with their lives,
which is what a lot of aid does,"
she said. "Ultimately, that won't
really help anyone."

Rodrigues said that the Uni-
versity wanted to make a new
fraction in between two exist-
ing groups, which would have
severely reduced the wages of
many GSIs and GSSAs.
"(It) would have resulted in a
20-percent pay cut for many of
our members," she said.
Negotiations came to a
standstill when the Univer-
sity came back to the bargain-
ing table on Thursday refusing
to consider GEO's proposal,
Rodrigues said.
"We were in bargaining with
them for 16 hours (on Wednes-
day)," she said. "The University's
team had given (GEO) proposals
and said, 'OK, we'll look at your
proposals, we'll see what move-
ment there can be.' And today
they said, 'There is no move-
ment. We will not move on any-
thing."'
Thursday night, GEO held a
general membership meeting in
which members decided not to
go back to the negotiation table,
Rodrigues said.
"I think GEO made the deci-
sion that people power is greater
than financial power," she said.
"That financial power is impor-
tant, we took that into consid-
eration at every stop of this
process."
While right to work could
mean a significant financial
loss for GEO when its contract
expires, Rodrigues noted the

story of a particular member
who couldn't afford to take a pay
cut.
"(With the) salary he was
making now, his family was
looking into food stamps," she
said. "They're on the line. We
thought that we cannot sacrifice
that much."
Rodrigues continued, saying
the possibility of members opt-
ing not to pay dues did not intim-
idate GEO.
"Ultimately in a right-to-work
state, if you are well organized,
right to work does not matter,"
she said, adding that accepting
the deal the University was pro-
posing "would simply degrade
our membership."
Rodrigues even recalled when
GEO fought to be recognized as
employees from 1976-81 by the
University, existing five years
without a contract.
In an interview on Wednes-
day, Rodrigues said GEO hoped
to reach a deal by Friday as GEO
members must wait at least two
weeks before they can vote on a
proposed contract. This was a
tight deadline, as the right-to-
work legislation takes effect two
weeks from Friday.
The legislation passed by the
state of Michigan in a marathon
final session at the end of 2012
allows employees represented by
unions to opt out of payingunion
dues. All GSIs and GSSAs pay
1.48 percent of their semesterly
salary to receive the benefits
derived from GEO's bargaining,
according to GEO's website. To
be a full member of the union,

they must pay 1.68 percent of
their salary.
On Wednesday, Rodrigues
had said bargaining has been
going "pretty well," with eight of
the current contract's 27 articles
opened up for negotiation.
Still, Rodrigues said she was
not certain how many non-full
members of GEO knew that bar-
gaining was taking place. She
did, however, say that GEO is
aware of the subset of GSIs and
GSSAs who don't support the
union.
"We always take them into
consideration," Rodrigues said.
"I can speak for myself and a
lot of the other GEO member-
ship when I say that we really
do respect our Republican mem-
bers, our conservative members.
The thing about it is that we
actually haven't heard anything
from anybody."
Rodrigues also noted that the
bargaining is open to general
members, not just full members.
Rackham student Mike Palaz-
zolo, a GSI and general member
of GEO, said union leadership
didn't seem concerned with non-
full members of the union.
"I doubt (non-full members
knew)," Palazzo said. "I e-mailed
some of my friends - they had no
idea."
In an interview earlier on
Thursday, Fitzgerald acknowl-
edged that the University's
Board of Regents had met in an
informal meetinglast Friday, but
declined to comment on whether
the discussion was about labor
negotiations.

Judge sides with A2 pizza
chain in healthcare case

Feds blocked from
requiring Domino's
Pizza to provide
contraceptives
DETROIT (AP) - A judge on
Thursday blocked the federal
government from requiring the
founder of Domino's Pizza to
provide mandatory contracep-
tion coverage to his employees
under the health care law.
U.S. District Judge Lawrence
Zatkoff granted a preliminary
injunction against enforcement
of the contraception provision of
the law against Tom Monaghan
and Domino's Farms Corp., a
management company located
near Ann Arbor, Mich.
The company, which is not
connected to Domino's Pizza,
has 45 full-time and 44 part-
time employees, according to its
court filing. Monaghan sold his
controlling stake in Domino's
Pizza in 1998 to private equity

company Bain Capital and sold
his remaining Domino's stock
in 2004, according to Domino's
Pizza spokesman Chris Bran-
don.
"It is in the best interest of
the public that Monaghan not be
compelled to act in conflict with
his religious beliefs," Zatkoff
wrote.
Monaghan is a Roman Cath-
olic and said in his suit that
he considers contraception a:
"gravely immoral" practice. He
offers employees health insur-
ance that excludes coverage for
contraception and abortion.
The new federal law requires
employers to offer insurance
that includes contraception cov-
erage or risk fines. According to
Zatkoff's order, Domino's Farms
faced $200,000 in yearly pay-
ments under the law. Employers
have until Aug.1 to comply with
the law.
U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services spokes-
woman Erin Shields said Thurs-
day night that she couldn't

comment on the matter because
the litigation is still pending.
In its response to the suit
filed in December, the depart-
ment denied the health care
law had a substantial effect
on Monaghan's exercise of his
rights to religious freedom or
freedom of speech.
The provisions of the health
care law "are narrowly tailored
to serve two compellinggovern-
ment interests: improving the
health of women and children,
and equalizing the provision of
preventive care for women and
men so that women who choose
to can be a part of the workforce
on an equal playing field with
men," the government said.
Erin Mersino, a lawyer for
the Thomas More Law Center,
a conservative Christian legal
defense group that represented
Monaghan, noted that the law
requires employers to offer
health coverage that includes
access to the morning-after pill
and similar emergency contra-
ception pills.

Bad business
Grading policies should be consistent across campus
The University's Ross School of Business is consistently ranked
as one of the top ten business schools in the country, but on
campus it has a reputation as an exclusive community. While
the Business School's private gym might earn some jealous eyerolls, the
School's unique grading structure is a real cause for concern. Accord-
ing to Lynn Wooten, the Business School's associate dean of under-
graduate programs, the School has been assigning a grade point of 4.4
to Bachelor's of Business Administration undergraduate students who
earn an A+ in any class since the 1950s. This grading policy, which will
be reviewed next year, is different than the grading policies of other
undergraduate programs at the University. In all other schools, a 4.0 is
given for an A+. This policy creates inequities in the grade distributions
of non-business classes taken by Ross students. The Business School
should make its grading policy consistent with other undergraduate
schools and programs within the University.

Chivez's real Venezuela

In an LSA class, a Business student can
earn a 4.4 grade point, while at the same
time, an LSA student who worked equally as
hard can earn a maximum of 4.0. The Busi-
ness School's current grading policy incen-
tivizes taking classes perceived to be easier
to boost GPAs, rather than selecting classes
based on interest. This may inflate the grades
of students who choose classes based on their
expectations of receiving a high grade.
The Business School's grade-inflating poli-
cies are by and large unique to the University.
In top business programs like those at Notre
Dame University, University of Virginia and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, any
grade within the A range grade earns a 4.0
with no disparity between other colleges. The
Business School's grading difference might
give students a slight edge in employment
opportunities, but also highlights a discrep-
ancy among how the University prepares its
Business undergraduates for post-graduation
life. Grades are important, but inflating the
grades in only one program suggests that the
Business School is more focused on making its
graduates appear attractive on paper than by
merit. The fact that other top business schools

refrain from such inflation suggests the Busi-
ness School should change its policies.
The Business School also has a number
of unique policies outside of grading that
contribute to the Bachelor in Business
Administration program's high rankings in
publications like U.S. News. For example,
Business juniors and seniors have an extra
week added to their winter break in order
to seek out internships and job offers. In
addition, Ross avoids scheduling Friday
classes so that their students can compete in
case competitions, attend special events at the
Business School and work on group projects.
It's not that Business students don't deserve
these perks, but if they're offered to them,
they should be offered to undergraduates
across the University.
This year, the University unveiled plans
to allow LSA undergraduates to receive a
Business minor. Slated to start in the fall of
2013, LSA students will take classes to learn
business skills alongside their other studies.
As the University moves toward integrating
Ross into the rest of the campus community,
it's essential that the administration change
the inequities that exist between colleges.

Gabriela Vasquez's opinion piece,
("Shake off Chavismo," 3/13/13), was a
particularly crudeexample ofthe dis-
tortions that have characterized U.S.
press coverage of Venezuela since
Hugo Chavez was first elected presi-
dent in 1998. Since then, U.S. politi-
cians and the press have portrayed
Chavez as a tyrant who destroyed
his country's democratic institutions
and economy. As Vasquez argued,
"Chavez had completely taken over
Venezuela and turned it into a pov-
erty-ridden, semi-military, semi-per-
sonalistic dictatorship, disguised as a
democracy."
Unfortunately, Vasquez's col-
umn suffers from a complete lack
of empirical evidence. Rather than
citing any data, she relies entirely
on impressions gleaned from her
time visiting Venezuela as a child
and the comments of her right-wing
family members, who are evidently
wealthy enough to finance many
family trips to Venezuela each year
("We were always there for our
birthdays, our relatives' birthdays,
holidays, etc.").
Personal opinions and stories are
important, but the views of a few
affluent Venezuelans are a poor sub-
stitute for polls and economic data.
The evidence tells a very differ-
ent story. Hugo Chavez was elected
four times, beating the right-wing
opposition candidate by a substan-
tial margin each time. Annual opin-
ion polls conducted by the Chilean
organization Latinobardmetro
have consistently found that Vene-
zuelans are relatively satisfied with
the state of their democracy. In the
last poll in 2011, Venezuelans rated
their country the third most demo-
cratic in all of Latin America, and
only 25 percent said "citizen partic-
ipation" in politics and government
"is lacking" - the best rating in the
entire region. Close U.S. allies such
as Columbia, Mexico and Honduras
have fared far worse in the Latino-
bardmetro polls.
Vasquez's claim that "inde-

pendent media virtually disap-
peared" under Chavez is often
heard in the U.S. media but is sim-
ply false. According to a 2010 study
by the Center for Economic and
Policy Research, state TV chan-
nels account for about 6 percent
of audience share. Most Venezu-
elan media sources are still owned
and controlled by wealthy private
interests. Most of these sources
not only oppose ChAvez's party, but
some even openly supported a 2002
military coup against him - a coup
backed by the United States. Imag-
ine what would happen to CNN or
The New York Times if they advo-
cated the military overthrow the
U.S. government.
The implication that Chavez
has further militarized Venezu-
ela is also, disingenuous. In 2011,
Venezuela spent $3.1 billion on its
military, according to the Stock-
holm International Peace Research
Institute. By comparison, the Unit-
ed States spent about $700 billion
- roughly as much as the rest of
the world combined. Venezuelan
cities do have a problem with vio-
lent crime, which may explain the
armed guards that Vasquez saw in
the streets, but in that respect, Ven-
ezuela isn't dramatically different
from many other Latin American
countries. And that problem exists
despite, not because of, the govern-
ment's policies.
Contrary to Vasquez's imagery
of vast slums created by the Chavez
government's failed economic
policies, since 2003, Venezuela
has maintained strong economic
growth while cutting poverty in
half and reducing extreme poverty
by 70 percent. As economist Mark
Weisbrot notes, "Millions of people
also got access to health care for
the first time, and access to educa-
tion also increased sharply, with
college enrollment doubling and
free tuition for many. Eligibility for
public pensions tripled."
Vasquez expresses thinly veiled

contempt for the millions of poor
and working-class Venezuelans who
support Chavez's political project.
The only explanation for his popu-
larity, she implies, is "the ignorance
of the population," who "blindly
acceptedeverywordhespoke"while
remaining oblivious to the reality
around them. But the real problem
- at least for the traditional Venezu-
elan elite and the U.S. government -
is that most Venezuelans are acutely
aware of reality. They understand,
based on their own experiences, the
problems caused by two centuries
of oligarchic rule, particularly the
neoliberal period of the 1980s and
1990s when public services were
privatized, social spending slashed
and foreign oil corporations made
out like bandits while the major-
ity of the population languished in
dismal poverty.
Despite the conventional depic-
tion in the U.S. media, the changes
in Venezuela since 1998 haven't
simply been the result of Hugo
Chavez imposing his personal will
on the country. Millions of Venezu-
elans have played an active part in
promoting - and radicalizing - the
transformation associated with
Chavez. Workers have occupied fac-
tories and have taken to the streets
to defend against right-wing coup
attempts and U.S. meddling. Hun-
dreds of thousands of citizens have
participated in community-run
media .outlets, democratic worker
cooperatives, community gover-
nance structures called communal
councils and other institutions of
participatory democracy. Whatev-
er his flaws - and he certainly did
have some - Chavez opened a space
for the poor majority to make them-
selves heard. Though Chavez is
gone, it's unlikely that Venezuelans
will allow the clock to be turned
back anytime soon.

VIVIAN BURGETT I
Read this, I'm Irish

The other day I was lamenting the fact that
I have to work on St. Patrick's Day even though
I'm Irish. Other people couldn't believe that I
was going to work on March 17 because some-
how being Irish has become such an identify-
ing feature for me. But then I started thinking
- does St.Patrick'sDay really mean more to me
because I'm Irish? Does this holiday that was
once a celebration of Irish-American culture
really mean anything to me aside from the fact
that suddenly everyone thinks it's really cool
that I'm Irish? After all, isn't Everyone Irish on
St. Patrick's Day?'
I hear people complain all the time that
America takes religious or cultural holidays
and injects them with consumerism. Mardi
Gras is now "Paczki Day" - let's be honest,
Fat Tuesday isn't really a better name - and
St. Valentine's Day has turned into "the day
of buying chocolate and going out to dinner/
staying in with a pint of ice cream." I'm not
really bothered by the fact that these holidays
have come to represent American consumer-
ism. I've accepted that that's just something
we do. After all, St. Patrick's Day celebrations
in America started as a way to show solidarity
for Ireland when it was trying to gain inde-
pendence from Britain.
But now that Ireland is independent, what
significance does St. Patrick's Day hold any-
more? It's hard to say that the holiday is a cel-
ebration of Irish-American culture when Irish
blood is so ubiquitous that there's hardly a spe-
cific culture anymore. So now the holiday is
an excuse for drinking. And that's fine - but it
would be nice if we could distance it a bit more
from Irish culture.
Unlike all those other holidays that became
excuses for consumerism, St. Patrick's Day
projects a negative stereotype. There's this idea
that 'everybody's Irish' and thus celebrating
like the Irish by getting drunker than all of the
Real Housewives of New York combined.
To be fair, this stereotype of the Irish being
heavy drinkers has a basis in reality: Drinking
is socially acceptable in Irish culture. Beer was
brewed in monasteries for hundreds of years -
St. Patrick himself is said to have had his own
brewer. I've come to realize that drinking is
not so acceptable in other cultures, and maybe
that's where this idea of 'everybody's Irish'

comes in. People hide behind another culture
to justify binge drinking. St. Patrick's Day has
become some sort of excuse for debauchery.
That's all right, but let's at least recognize that
this element of St. Patrick's Day - going to the
bar at 7 a.m. - is decidedly un-Irish. After all,
anyone who's truly hardcore Irish would only
be getting up that early to go to church.
Someone recently asked me if my mom was
going to the bar all day for St. Patrick's Day
since she's Irish. That was a little embarrass-
ing for me. Do people really think that all Irish
people embrace such intense binge drinking?
My mother may be Irish, but she's much too old
to drink for eight hours straight - and perfectly
horrified at the prospect of me doing the same.
This is something that college kids do, not the
Irish. And this is where the stereotypes get per-
sonal: The British used the stereotype of the
Irish as drunken savages to justify their coloni-
zation of Ireland.
Now, the fact that St. Patrick's Day contin-
ues to reinforce those stereotypes that made
life so much harder for my ancestors is pretty
frustrating. We may use cultural holidays as
an excuse for consumerism, butI can't think of
any other consumerist version of a culture that
upholds a stereotype like this one. "Paczki Day"
doesn't portray Poles as fatsoes. Cinco de Mayo,
now also an excuse to drink, doesn't project the
same image of alcoholism on Mexicans. To my
knowledge, St. Patrick's Day is the only holiday
that embraces a derogatory stereotype.
So, yes, I'll be drinking on St. Patrick's Day,
but I'll be sober in time to go to work - though
given my Irish pride and the stereotypes, I bet
my boss will doubt my sobriety. My mother
will also probably have a beer or two and most
definitely will make corned beef for dinner. As
an American college student, St. Patrick's Day
to me means drinking Irish beer and wearing
green. As an Irish-American, St. Patrick's Day is
the one day where it's coolto be pale and where
I'm not ashamed to blast "The Rocky Road to
Dublin" from my porch, car and workplace.
I have no qualms with people drinking from
dawn 'til dusk, but for the love of God, do you
have to deck yourselves with tacky cloverleaves
and Irish flags?

A love letter to Amy Poehler

a

I've been really grateful for all
of the smart women in movies and
on television lately: Kristen Wiig is
makingbox-office hits, MindyKaling
has her own TV show and Tina Fey
seems to have the Midas touch.
The leading lady that captured
my heart, however, is Amy Poehler.
Like a breath of fresh air in a stale,
male-dominated media, Poehler
is hilarious, opinionated and sup-
portive of her gal pals. Her televi-
sion show can give women hope
because, while plenty of shows have
amazing character actor ensembles
or witty writing, "Parks and Recre-
ation" has realistic female friend-
ships, namely that of Leslie Knope
and Ann Perkins.
The relationship between these
two women is loving and support-
ive. They have tons of fun together.
They aren't catty, manipulative or
competitive like the "Real House-
wives" women. They work hard at
their friendship. They set aside time
for each other and help each other
achieve their life goals. And their
friendship is independent of any man
- "Uteruses before Duderuses!"
Even better is that this show isn't
primarily targeted toward women

- it's full of humor that appeals to
both genders. This is a noteworthy
feat, especially considering most
exemplary female friendships in
the media are exclusively relegated
to female-targeted media. Lifetime
movies, romantic comedies and
"Sex and the City" immediately
come to mind.
It's easy to overlook the rarity of
strong female friendships on televi-
sion. Many shows suffer from the
"Smurfette Principle," which states
that unless a show is purposefully
aimed at a female viewing audi-
ence, the characters will tend to be
disproportionately male. This often
manifests itself as a group of guys
with one girl in the main cast. Obvi-
ous illustrations of this include "It's
Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"
"Seinfeld," "The New Girl," "'The
Big Bang Theory" and of course,
"The Smurfs." I love you Miss
Piggy, but are you really content as
the only female Muppet?
Other movies or shows have
female characters, but their main
purpose is to enhance the male
cast members. Don't believe me?
The Bechdel test was designed to
measure this exact phenomenon.

A movie or an episode passes the
Bechdel test if it has three elements:
at least two female characters who
speak, those female characters
speak to each other and when they
speak to each other, they're talking
about something other than a man.
Sounds easy enough? At least half of
all films and TV episodes fail.
Don't get me wrong. I love the
media despite misogyny. "The Lord
of the Rings" trilogy is my favorite
set of films, even though Middle
Earth is mostly devoid of females. I
own all the seasons of "It's Always
Sunny on DVD, and Sweet Dee is
her own awesome flavor of a-hole.
But as a smart female, I want to see
females on TV that I can relate to,
maybe even admire. And I want to
see those females in healthy, sup-
portive friendships with each other.
How can we achieve this change?
By demanding it! By watching
shows like "Parks and Rec", and
appreciating it as the rare, beautiful
musk ox that it is. And I'm sure my
weekly love letters to Amy Poehler
don't hurt either.

Awards show to
celebrate student-
selected champions
By ANDREW ECKHOUS
DailyArts Writer
Apparently, a dungeon exists
somewhere in MTV's studios,
somewhere that still plays music.
Known as mtvU, the television
network targets college students
and broadcasts a variety of pro-
grams about things that we care
about, like activism (obviously)
and cool robot music.
All jokes aside, mtvU panders
more convincingly than most
other corporate shills. It spon-
sors Fulbright Scholars and has
a number of opportunities that
involve college students. But the
opportunities aren't exclusively
for service, though, and the mtvU
Woodie Awards exemplify just
that.
Billed as an award show for
"the best in indie, underground
and everything in between," the
mtvU Woodie Awards allow col-'
lege students (like you and me!)
to make the decisions, and most
of the nominees are acts that don't
get much love from the main-
stream shows.
Recently, The Michigan Daily
took part in a Woodie Awards
conference call with DJ Dillon
Francis and rapper A$AP Rocky,
in which both artists talked about
their craft, their rising popularity
and what the awards nominations

mean to them.
Francis was first known for his
forays into moombahton, a Latin-
infused brandof electronic music.
Soon after, he signed to Diplo's
Mad Decent label and has seen
his notoriety grow since being
anointed an "artist to watch" by
MTV's electronic music show,
"Clubland." Nominated for
"Breaking Woodie" (Best New
Artist, for you squares out there),
Francis considers a Woodie win
as an achievement, but only a tem-
porary one.
"If I win it, I think it will be
really cool ... but, for me, I'm just
going to keep doing what I'm
doing and keep making music that
I really love, and that's it," he said.
While many of Francis's
dreams have already come true,
like working with DJ Calvin Har-
ris, he won't let such success go
to his head. From a hardworking
family in Los Angeles, Francis
often describes his unyielding
work ethic and seems serious
about sitting atop the throne of
EDM (electronic dance music)
one day. He's "aiming for 10,000
hours (of work)" by next year, and
with his debut album on the way,
Francis could be a big name for
years to come.
Back for the second year in a
row, Harlem's A$AP Rocky took a
step forward this year. Last year,
A$AP performed and earned
a nomination for "Breaking
Woodie," but this year, he's up for
"Woodie of the Year" as the odds-
on favorite.
A$AP's flavor of New York rap

contains a shot of Houston siz-
zurp, and the hype surrounding
him has been growing ever since
he signed a 3-million dollar con-
tract with Sony in late 2011. Like
Francis, success means more to
A$AP than any award.
"Coming up to me and telling
me that you enjoyed my music
when (you're) a total stranger is
better than winning a Grammy to
me."
Randomly peppering the con-
versation with "swag" and "they
call me flocka," the slow-talking
A$AP described the legacy he
wants to leave, and it's one for the
kids.
"Legacy? I'm teaching the
youth ... through all my songs and
my energy. ... It's a new day and
age; we need to get back and bring
back the hippie power.... We (are)
all one people; we need to get high
and enjoy life together the way we
did back in the '70s, and that's the
legacy I'm gonna leave behind.
Swagswag."
For all of his praise of the hip-
pies, A$AP displays tremendous
business savvy as well. When
asked what he's bought with his
money so far, he yelled "not a
damn thing," emphasizing that
the money is an investment in his
career. He considers himself "the
future" and, with his meteoric
rise to fame, it seems like he might
be right.
ASAP wouldn't mind some
hardware on his mantle, though.
He declined to make a prediction
on the voting, but said, "I hope I
win. That's it."

Melissa Rosenberg ("Twilight")
produces the new series about
recently widowed Marta Wal-

Evan (Anson Mount, "Hell On

son. But before Evan is murdered,
audiences quickly learn that
the Walravens are no ordinary

$7.5 million fund to aid in
life science research labs

Program partially
funded by
state economic
development corp.
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Relieving a throbbing head-
ache, stuffy nose or aching
stomach often takes no more
effort than tapping a few col-
ored capsules from bottle to
palm. But before new medical
treatments reach their patients,
the road from research lab to
drugstore shelf is long and com-
plex, often spanning more than
a decade.
Now, a new $7.5 million fund
will help University research-
ers shave a few years off the
process by providing additional
resources to propel promising
projects from the research to
the consumer stages.
The program, MTRAC
for Life Sciences, is partially
funded by a $2.4 million grant
from the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation's
21st Century Jobs Fund. The
remainder of the funding will
be provided by the University's
Medical School, the Vice Pres-
ident for Research's Office,
and the Office of Technology
Transfer.
While the Medical School
has consistently ranked highly
in terms of funding, Connie
Chang, director of the Medi-
cal School's Office of Business
Development, said MTRAC
is the first vehicle dedicated
exclusively to jumpstart-
ing projects with commercial
potential.
In typical circumstances,
researchers scope out many
small pockets of research
grants to test their ideas, a pro-
cess that often draws out the

timeframe of the development
process. The new funding pro-
gram, however, will pump in
more money at earlier stages
when studies look promising
but fall short of capturing a bio-
medical company's investment.
Once the research is identi-
fied as promising, grant funds,
as well as an oversight commit-
tee of experts, provide addi-
tional resources to catalyze
development.
But before funding is fun-
neled towards specific projects,
the Medical School must select
which efforts have the poten-
tial for commercialization.
Tom Shanley, associate dean
of clinical and translational
research at the Medical School,
is involved in the early selec-
tion stage.
In the vetting process his
team considers two main fac-
tors. They look for approaches
or technologies that can have
the greatest impact on a health
problem and would have a large
enough market to have a likeli-
hood of commercial success.
While all of the research
is important and potentially
groundbreaking, not every proj-
ect meets the qualifications.
Some research may transform
the way physicians care for spe-
cific diseases, but may not have
the potential for being turned
into a pharmaceutical device,
technological advancement or
diagnostic method.
Advancements not specifi-
cally slated for market are dis-
seminated throughout the
medical community and still
have a significant impact, even
though they are not converted
into a tangible product.
Once vetted, Shanley said
an advisory board provides
experts to help researchers
navigate the development pro-
cess, including advice in han-
dling FDA regulations and

optimizing clinical studies.
The Office of Technology
Transfer, a contributor to the
program, is specifically dedi-
cated to moving development
projects along by providing
project teams, seeking out
venture capitalists and gener-
ally assisting entrepreneurs.
MTRAC seeks to augment these
efforts by proactively identify-
ing projects it can expedite.
"It builds on already a very
strong foundation," Chen said.
"I think it's the right time for us
to think about being proactive
about helping to move these
projects forward. It's a really
important strategic direction
we have to move in and it helps
to accelerate what was happen-
ing before organically."
In addition, Shanley and
Chang said the program, par-
tially funded by the state of
Michigan, has potential to spur
economic growth in the region
and state.
"There would some advan-
tage to the Michigan economy
if that development process
requires a new business entity
because that would mean jobs
and improved economy for the
state when achieving that mar-
ketable product," Shanley said.
"This is a very exciting part-
nership between the Medical
School and the state and we
think this is going to be a cru-
cial component of the overall
innovation program."
Besides the economic impact,
Chang said the program is cru-
cial in the crusade to improve
patient care.
"If we really want to change
the face of health care, if we
really want to impact patient
care we really have to think
about how the research we are
doing is going to become a new
product or innovation that is
going to get to the market and
impact people."

and reduce risks - like by not
serving drinks in glass bottles.
"Community nembers are a
major part of the effort to reduce
consequences that may happen in
the city," Pehlke said. "The police
don't have to be the only ones
around (watching out for public
safety)."
Pehlke said the community has
been extremely receptive to the
campaign as they want a profit-
able but drama-free weekend.
LSA sophomore Tommy
Wydra, vice president of social
responsibility for the Interfrater-
nity Council, said even though
relatively cold temperatures have
been forecasted for this weekend,
students will most likely hold
parties on off-campus locations
during the daytime. He said fra-
ternities have coordinated major
events for Saturday to allow for a
less chaotic environment for visi-
tors coming to town on Sunday.
The IFC is heading up a student
safety lookout program called
Michigan Ambassadors. Student
volunteers were trained by Uni-
versity Health Services, UMPD
and AAPD to evaluate the safe-

ness of parties.
LSA Student Government,
Central Student Government and
Beyond the Diag, a student orga-
nization promoting off-campus
safety, are partnering up to keep
students entertained and safe
on Sunday. The groups will take
shifts passing out food at differ-
ent locations on- and off-campus.
Caroline Canning, the presi-
dent of LSA Student Government,
said volunteers will be passing
out bagels in the morning for
early partiers. The group will be
located in areas with a high con-
centration of students: outside
the Union, at the corner of South
University and East University
streets, and the neighborhood
area on Oakland and East Univer-
sity streets.
"We just want to make sure that
students when they are waking up
early are able to have food in their
stomachs and staysafe throughout
the day," Canning said.
CSG will also be hosting its
second annual tailgate on the
Diag. There willbe performances,
music and free food for students.
"We don't want to ruin the fun,
we just want everyone to be fed
and hydrated," said Jill Clancy,
chief programming officer of the
CSG executive board.

Additionally, there will be Big
Ten Tournament watch parties at
the CCRB, the U Club and Pier-
pont Commons Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, as long as the team
continues in the tournament all
weekend.
Pehlke said these events are
usually well attended by students
and added that it is a common mis-
conception on campus that stu-
dents celebrate activities mainly
through consumingalcohol.
"All of our studies and research
has shown that most of our stu-
dents drink in a safe way and/
or don't drink," Pehlke said. "So
that's actuallythe norm."
University Police spokeswom-
an Diane Brown said in a state-
ment that there will be additional
uniformed officers patrolling the
Central Campus area through-
out the weekend. She added that
Joe Piersante, UMPD chief and
the interim executive director of
the Division of Public Safety and
Security, has also been collaborat-
ing with Ann Arbor Police Chief
John Seto and the Dean of Stu-
dents' office regarding the "stay
safe" messages for students.
"We're anticipating that stu-
dents and others will celebrate
passionately, but also responsibly
and stay safe," Brown said.

Pope Francis tied to 'dirty
war' debate in Argentina

Opinions of human
rights activists
differ on culpability
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - It's beyond dispute that
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, like most
other Argentines, failed to openly
confront the 1976-1983 military
junta as it kidnapped and killed
thousands of people in a "dirty
war" to eliminate leftist oppo-
nents.
But human rights activists dif-
fer on how much responsibility
Pope Francis personally deserves
for the Argentine church's dark
historyof supporting the murder-
ous dictatorship.
The new pope's authorized
biographer, Sergio Rubin, argues
that this was a failure of the
Roman Catholic Church in gen-

eral, and that it's unfair to label
Bergoglio, then athirtysomething
leader ofArgentina's Jesuits, with
the collective guilt that many
Argentines of his generation still
wrestle with.
"In some way many of us
Argentines ended up being
accomplices," at a time when
anyone who spoke out could be
targeted, Rubin recalled in an
interview with The Associated
Press just before the papal con-
clave.
SomeleadingArgentinehuman
rights activists agree that Bergo-
glio, now 76, doesn't deserve to
be lumped together with other
church figures who were closely
aligned with the dictatorship.
"Perhaps he didn't have the
courage of other priests, but he
never collaborated with the dic-
tatorship," Adolfo Perez Esquivel,
who won the 1980 Nobel Peace

Prize for documenting the junta's
atrocities, said Thursday. "Ber-
goglio was no accomplice of the
dictatorship. He can't be accused
of that," Perez Esquiveltold Radio
de la Red in Buenos Aires.
But others say Bergoglio's rise
through the Argentine church
since then has put him in many
positionsofpowerwhere he could
have done more to atone for the
sins of Catholic officials who did
actively conspire with the dicta-
tors. Some priests even worked
insidetorture centers,andblessed
those doing the killing.
And now that. Argentina is
actively putting former dictator-
ship figures on trial for human
rights violations, they say he's
been more concerned about pre-
serving the church's image than
providing evidence that could
lead to convictions.
"There's hypocrisy here when
it comes to the church's conduct,
and with Bergoglio in particular,"
said Estela de la Cuadra, whose
family lost five members during
the junta years and whose mother
co-founded the Grandmothers of
the Plaza de Mayo activist group
to search for missing people.
"There are trials of all kinds now,
and Bergoglio systematically
refuses to support them."
Bergoglio twice invoked his
right under Argentine law to
refuse to appear in open court
in trials involving torture and
murder inside the feared Navy
Mechanics School and the theft
of babies from detainees. When
he eventually did testify in 2010,
his answers were evasive, human
rights attorney Myriam Bregman
told the AP.

SPITTING IMAGE
From Page 10
back and pill out two ministicks and two shoes
in the corner of each side. We'd play for 20 minutes
and then go right back up and watch the second or
third period."
Mike wasn't far enough along in his own hockey
career to take away game strategy or skating tech-
nique from his time spent with his dad or the other
players. But the off-ice demeanor and way the
NHLers carried themselves away from the game
weren't lost on him.
"What I reallytook awayfromthemwas thetype
of people they are away from the rink," Mike said.
"They're such humble and down-to-earth gentle-
men. They all put their families first (and) know
that hockey's just a little portion of their life."
Though the Chiasson family placed itself in
numerous social circles within the community,
there was little question that the Hurricanes
had created their own close-knit little pocket in

officially been retired, but it has been taken out of
circulation.
Mike still wears No. 3, though. He always has.
In fact, he's worn it for everything, from hockey to
soccer. He got lucky when he came to Michigan in
the fall of 2011 - Scooter Vaughan had just gradu-
ated that May, leaving the No. 3 jersey available for
the taking.
From the jersey number to the mannerisms,
so much of Mike just screams Steve. When Fran-
cis has seen Mike play for Michigan, at times he
swears he's watching his old teammate - with
Mike's features covered by a facemask, there's no
easy way to distinguish him from Steve.
Sometimes, even Susan can't tell the difference.
"She says she'll just look, and it gets kind of
scary because the (resemblances) are starting to
become more and more prevalent," Mike said. "She
met him at this age so she's starting to see some
similarities now (with) hand gestures or the way
we word things."
Now that he's older, Mike's able to appreciate
some of the finer aspects of Steve's game, such as
the way he manned the power play or the force
with which he shot the puck. Mike says sometimes,
he notices how he channels his dad when he plays
- he likes to "take care of (his) own end first and
make a good first pass."
At 205 pounds, Steve was slightly bigger than
his son is now - Mike jokes that he wasn't lucky
enough to get those genes.
"I think my dad was a more physical and offen-
sive defenseman," Mike said. "He played the game
hard and played the game honest. He played the
game the way it was played back then, and obvi-
ously the game's changed a little bit now."
here were two funerals for Steve. One
was in Raleigh, the one that most of the
Carolina Hurricanes attended.
The other was in Peterborough, Ont., where
Steve and Susan were from and where the family
still owns a cottage. There's a memorial for Steve
in a local park.
More of the Canadian hockey players that Steve
played with or knew attended the service in Peter-
borough - including Wayne Gretzky, who played
with Steve on the 1993 All-Star team.
"I just remember he came in, talked to me and
my brother, pulled us aside," Mike said. "I don't
really remember much of the conversation. He
brought us out to his car and gave us a couple of
signed sticks and a jersey. We still have that at
home."

Sobotka has been the buildings operation man-
ager for the Red Wings for the last 30 years. He
drives the Zamboni during the intermissions and
picks octopi off the ice during the playoffs. Though
Mike's interactions with the Red Wings were brief,
Sobotka still remembers him - there's always time
for a friendly chat after Michigan finishes its pre-
game skate.
"I guess you could say I continue the relation-
ship my dad had with them," Mike said. "Hockey's
a small world, and they really are genuinely nice
people. My life did come full circle."
t was Dec. 14, 2012. Michigan had just
dropped a 4-1 decision to Western Michigan
in its final home series before winter break. Holden
was outside Yost Ice Arena next to CBS' production
truck, chatting with long-time Michigan hockey
announcer Al Randall.
From 100 feet away, Holden saw Mike emerge
from Yost. He gave a wave, a friendly gesture to
a player he'd only interacted with a couple times
before, before returning to his conversation with
Randall.
But instead of going home, Mike turned to walk
down the parking lot, shake Holden's hand, smile
and say, "Hey Ben, how are you?"
Here Mike was, with his team coming off an
embarrassing loss, and he took a few moments
to chat with a sports announcer he barely knew.
Holden was flabbergasted.
But he was also impressed. So the next night,
while doing his commentary, Holden made sure to
give a shoutout to Mike's mom Susan, watching at
her home in Henderson, Nev.
"I remember saying something that night to the
effect of his parents did an amazing job raising
him," Holden said. "To me, the most impressive
thing about Mike Chiasson is the person that he is.
A good, whole-hearted, respectful human being."
Mike has no doubts about where these quali-
ties came from. Much of his character comes from
Steve. Being told he channels his dad is one of the
biggest compliments he can get - it's something he
strives for as much as possible in his everyday life.
"I'm very proud of my last name," he said. "I'm
very proud of the family that I came from. The way
(my dad) treated my mom was amazing, the way
he treated all of us kids was exceptional. That's
something that I try to hopefully one day be able
to instill those traits and qualities into my family."
But until that day, those traits and qualities can
be seen on display at Yost every day.
On the ice, there's a hockey player, but more

It was that network that helped Mike feel so
comfortable around the team as a youngboy. It was
that network that helped the Chiassons through
the aftermath of Steve's death. It's that network
that still keeps in contact with the family.
Francis has seen Mike play a few times at
Michigan, making the trip up to New York City in
November for the Frozen Apple game against Cor-
nell. Former teammates of Steve still call the fam-
ily from time to time, and Susan stays in touch with
some of the other hockey wives. Mike sees several
of Steve's former teammates when his family sum-
mers at its cottage.
"There's still alhandful ofguys who visit us in the
summer who live in the local Toronto area," Mike
said. "We've got a pretty good group of NHLers
who live in the area in Peterborough whom, in
summers past, we work out with and skate with."
The NHL hasn't forgotten Mike. And Mike
hasn't forgotten it either.

CHICAGO - The Michigan
men's basketball team's interior
offense picked up right where it
left off from last Sunday's loss to
Indiana.
For the Wolverines, that spelled
trouble. Penn State, off to a 14-3
start in Thursday's opening round
of the Big Ten Tournament, out-
rebounded Michigan, 11-2, early
on. Meanwhile, redshirt junior
forward Jordan Morgan struggled
out of the gate and never found his
rhythm.
In his first three touches, Mor-
gan had a layup blocked, missed
another from point-blank range
and then, on a fast break, was
stripped.
Fortunately for the Wolverines,
it had a contingency plan in the
form of freshman forward Mitch
McGary. McGary, who registered
just two points and two rebounds
in eight foul-plagued minutes
against Indiana, almost single-
handedly saved Michigan in the
first half.
The Wolverines outscored the
Nittany Lions 32-19 after Penn
State's initial run, taking a 35-33
into halftime, with McGary lead-
ing the charge. The freshman
entered the game with only one
career double-double but already
had 10 points and 10 rebounds in
just 13 minutes by halftime.
McGary said it was his best half
in a Michiganuniform.
"I just felt like I was playing the
way should," McGary said.

Sophomore point guard Trey
Burke, who finished with yet
another stellar performance,
acknowledged that when McGary
entered the game, his presence
wasn't just felt inside the paint,
but by his whole team- both emo-
tionally and schematically.
"That's Mitch McGary; that's
just how he is," Burke said. "He
came off the bench and gave us a
spark and once he comes off the
bench, it gets the crowds into it ...
and that gives us energy.
"When ... our bigs get in there,
get some second-chance points,
get fouled, get to the line, I think
that opens it up for our perimeter
players"
And when McGary's presence
quieted in the second half - he
added only one rebound and was
held off the scoreboard after the
break - redshirt sophomore for-
ward Jon Horford stepped up.
Horford was scoreless in the
first half, but came through with
11 points in the second stanza. .
Even though Morgan finished
with just four points and two
rebounds, Michigan still out-
rebounded Penn State, 36-32,
pulled down 21 offensive boards
and scored 28 second-chance
points.
"That's what our bigs (have) got
to do," McGary said. "When we
show up, it's tough to beat us."
The Wolverines, and espe-
cially their frontcount, have been
criticized at times throughout
the season for being physically
soft and failing to show up in key
games. Earlier this week, against

the Hoosiers, Michigan was out-
rebounded 47-26 - an embarrass-
ing margin.
McGary was quick to admit
that the criticism doesn't fall on
deaf ears, and that's something
he's okay with.
"I like when people say it,"
McGary said. "I turn the degrad-
ing comments into motivation....
People were saying we were soft,
so we went and grabbed some
rebounds, got a whole bunch of
put backs and we won the game."
Michigan coach John Beilein is
generally tight-lipped, especially
when it comes to roster changes,
but the coach couldn't deny that
he'll at least entertain the possi-
bility of moving McGary into the
starting lineup in place of Morgan.
McGary played poorly in his
only start this season - a four-
point, four-turnover effort at
Michigan State on Feb. 12 while
Morgan was injured - but the
combination of Morgan's strug-
gles and Michigan's propensity for
slow starts might be an indication
there will be a different starting
five when the Wolverines take the
floor FridayagainstWisconsin.
"We talk about the roster and
rotation everyday and we'll prob-
ably do that again, but a change
- I'm not going to say we're going
to do it or we're not going to do
it," Beilein said. "Sometimes, if
you do make a change, Jordan
will play more relaxed coming off

v

year.
Coming off its third consecu-
tive series sweep, the Wolverines
begin the next part of their run
to salvage the season on the road.
Michigan was swept by Western
Michigan the last time they met,
but this weekend the Wolverines
return to Lawson with much
more momentum.
Having won six consecutive
games while averaging more than
four goals per game and allowing
exactlytwo, Michiganisarguably
the hottest team in the CCHA.
"Michigan is a good team, we
knew that from the outset of the
season," said Western Michigan
coach Andy Murray in his weekly
press conference. "But we think
we match up well with them.
Led by a goaltender who has
made the saves he should and
then some, freshman Steve
Racine, Michigan's defense has
looked much improved, despite
sitting 54th in the nation in goals
allowed.
Racine has started the last six
games and sparked a defense to
skate to pucks faster, clear pucks
quicker, absorb shots more often

as much, we're getting a chance
to play with a lead and we've got
a little more confidence."
But the defense receives a
break when it travels to face the
51st-ranked offense in the nation,
as Western Michigan scores just
2.31 goals per game.
The Broncos' defense allows
fewer goals than their offense
scores, though, sitting third in
the nation by allowing just 1.92
goals per game. Led by defense-
men Danny DeKeyser, a first-
team All-CCHA member, and his
partner Luke Witkowski, West-
ern Michigan's defense excels
at limiting the shots goaltender
Frank Slubowski sees. Slubowski
allowed three goals while mak-
ing 43 saves during his last outing
against the Wolverines.
"I'm expecting these games to
be close," Berenson said. "Goals
are going to be precious. You
might get the odd good scoring
chance, but the rest of it is going
to be hard, good-working hockey."
The best matchup might come
on special teams this weekend, as
Western Michigan's 10th-ranked
penalty kill attempts to fend off

think there's probably going to
be a mutual respect factor on the
power plays. They know we can
do damage with ours.
"I imagine both coaching staffs
are going to emphasize the fact
that putting the other team on
a power play in an unnecessary
way is only hurting your team."
Michigan's offense will pose
an enigma then, as it has seen an
increase in production from all
lines in its recent hot streak. But
when itneedsto score, it's carried
by a first line that began produc-
ing since it last skated against
Western Michigan.
Last time out, the line of fresh-
man Boo Nieves, sophomore Phil
Di Giuseppe and senior Kevin
Lynch emerged as Michigan's
most dangerous scoring threat
against the Broncos, where the
trio combined for three assists
and agoal.
"We're going to need to play
well for our teamto have a chance
and the same with every other
line," Lynch said. "We haven't
been playing as well as we can
this past couple games so we defi-
nitely need to turn it on."

For Robinson and Kovacs, a final
steak dinner before uncertain future

A wager between
Robinson, Kovacs for
Chop House meal
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Someday soon, for one of the
final times before they move onto
the National Football League or
whatever might lie beyond, former
Michigan captains Denard Robin-
son and Jordan Kovacs will enjoy
a steak dinner together. One will
pay and one won't.
The idea started in workouts
with Michigan strength coach
Aaron Wellman as each prepared
for the NFL Draft and the slate of
drills it entails. As Roy Roundtree
explained, "During the shuttles
last week, Denard was like 'I'm
gonna run faster than you.' And
Jordan was like, 'Nah I'm gonna
run faster than you.' It was back
and forth."
Soon, the two decided to make a
wager, settling on three exercises:
the 20-yard shuttle, the 40-yard
dash and the three-cone drill.
Loser buys a dinner at The Chop
House in downtown Ann Arbor.
It was one final piece of moti-
vation for two ultra-competitive
athletes. And it was a sign of soli-
darity for two players who each
face an uncertain professional
future, even if each has a different
fight to get there.
Kovacs, the underdog again,
must prove that he has the athleti-
cism and ability to play at the next
level. For Robinson, the question
isn't about talent, it's about how he

can use it, and at what position.
The end of Robinson's Michi-
gan career - really starting after
the elbow injury in October that
ended his time at quarterback -
thrust his future into disorder.
To the NFL, Robinson is a tempt-
ing yet unknown quantity, with
potential at many positions but
polish at none.
He has practiced mostly as
a wide receiver, but he has also
worked out as a returner and a
running back and is even prepared
to play cornerback if asked. Every
team, it seemed, had different
needs, and Robinson was forced
to learn an array of different posi-
tions in a matter of weeks.
At first, the inexperience
showed. During the Senior Bowl,
Robinson struggled to field kicks
in practice and dropped the only
one he saw in the game. He man-
aged to catch two passes but for
just 22 yards, and he lacked preci-
sion in his routes.
"Obviously he had a tough
Senior Bowl," Kovacs said, before
adding: "Just seeing how much
work he's put in, it's unbelievable."
Slowly, through multiple work-
outs daily with Wellman and more
individual position work, Rob-
inson started improving. Field-
ing punts came easier, a result of
practicing daily for 30 minutes,
40 minutes, an hour, - "until the
kicker's leg gets tired," Robinson
said.
He refined his routes until they
gained precision. At the beginning
of the winter, despite Robinson's
athleticism, he often seemed awk-
ward, like a prized racehorse sud-
denly expected to navigate a show

jumping course. He thought too
much. He counted his steps when
he ran. He looked for the ball too
soon, or waited until it was too
late.
Now, "he don't count his steps
no more," Roundtree said. "When
he runs his routes, you can see that
he's getting in and out of his cuts,
and he's pretty confident in what
he's running. It shows the prog-
ress that he has made."
By Thursday, Michigan's Pro
Day, when the team's seniors
would work out for professional
scouts, he looked comfortable.
Robinson had already recorded
times in most major drills, at
the NFL Combine in February,
with positive results. His 4.43
40-yard dash was among the fast-
est times at the Combine. He ran
the 20-yard shuttle in 4.22 sec-
onds and the three-cone drill in
7.09 seconds - setting a target for
Kovacs to beat to win the steak.
Thursday, the focus for Robin-
son was onthe position drills. This
time, a confident glide replaced
unsure strides. He didn't drop a
single pass, teammates reported,
and he caught everything with his
hands. Robinson was even perfect
in the return drill.
It was all coming together.
Then came a. curveball. A few
scouts approached Robinson and
told him that in the preparation
for running back and wide receiv-
er and returner and cornerback,
he had perhaps ruled out quarter-
back prematurely.
"They said, 'Continue to throw
the ball,' " Robinson said. "I said,
'No problem."'
Nearby, Kovacs faced scrutiny

on a different part of his game.
Robinson's speed times were
important, but everyone knew he
was fast. Kovacs has the opposite
problem. His instincts and on-field
intelligence are an unquestioned
strength, but does the former
walk-on really have the explosive-
ness needed to cover NFL wide-
outs and tight ends?
For Kovacs, the winter entailed
almost no positional work.
Instead, Wellmen designed a pro-
gram to boost his measurables,
a heavy-weight, low-rep routine
aimed to help Kovacs run 40 yards
as fast as possible "and not die
after," as Kovacs put it.
Kovacs said the preparation
wasn't overwhelming because he
had ostensibly been through the
same process when he walked on
to the Michigan team. But his low
draft stock provided a familiar
motivation.
"I just like to prove people
wrong," Kovacs said.
He had his chance on Thurs-
day. He had three targets, set by
Robinson at the Combine. Beat-
ing them would mean steak, and it
would also go a long way to dem-
onstrating he had the athleticism
requisite for a professional, Three
drills, three goals: a 4.43 in the
40-yard dash, a 4.22 shuttle and a
709 shuttle.
He said he felt faster and lighter
than ever.
"It's funny, you do 100 of these
in the offseason," Kovacs said.
"You know, you do 100, and you
only get one rep."
That was all he needed. In
the 40, Kovacs, unsurprisingly,
couldn't touch Robinson, but his

Former Michigancaptains Denard Robinson(bottom right)and Jordan Kovacs
each face a different fight for the NFL Draft, even if they face them together.

4.58-second time was respectable.
Kovacs was disappointed in his
shuttle time, but his 4.19 seconds
was good enough to beat even
Robinson.
But his three-cone drill was a
statement. His time of 6.62 sec-
onds didn't just beat Robinson, it
destroyed him. Kovacs beat every
safety's time from the Combine,
and his time would've ranked him
third overall.
Afterward, Kovacs shrugged
off his performance's significance,
but he did concede that "Couldn't
have hurt" his draft stock. He
laughed. "I think we can all agree
on that.
"My whole mindset is, I just

need to get my foot in the door,"
Kovacs continued. "I've done it
once, I did it here. Get my foot in
the door, I'll make the most of my
opportunity."
Tony Pauline of DraftInsider.
net reported that the Patriots
invited Kovacs to a private work-
out.
Kovacs' performance was
emphatic, it was perception
changing - it was steak-worthy.
But that dinner will have to
wait a little bit longer. For Kovacs
and Robinson, there's still work
to do before the draft. There's no
room in the diet, even for steak,
even to settle a score between
friends.

Yost Ice Arena.
"It was the first time I'd seen
(Mike) play," Holden said. "That
was the lasting impression. If
you put in a clip and see his dad
and him, it's scary."
Mike's been told so many
times about the similarities
between him and Steve, but he
never gets tired of hearing it.
And he never gets tired of talk-
ing about he man who shaped his
childhood and helped bring him
to Michigan - all because Steve
enjoyed bringing his son to his
'office.'
t was Sunday, May 2,
..1999, and the Boston Bru-
ins had just shut out the Carolina
Hurricanes, 2-0, in the Stanley
Cup conference quarterfinals to
clinch the series in Game 6.
Steve registered two shots on
goal in that last game of the sea-
son for Carolina, but that wasn't
important. Hockey was over, and
now he had the summer to spend
with his family - but not before
stopping off at a teammate's
house after returning from Bos-
ton.
Susan Chiasson awoke her
sons early Monday morning. She
carried her 2-year-old daughter
Stephanie into the room that
Mike, then 8, shared with his
4-year-old brother Ryan. She
perched herself at the end of the
bed and tried to explain a situ-
ation that she herself was still
struggling to understand. Steve
was dead.
He was killed driving home
from a party at that teammate's
house. When the wreckage of his
truck was found, it had been dis-
covered that Steve's blood-alco-
hol content was more than three
times the legal limit.
Mike didn't believe what his
mother was saying. So, to go
prove her wrong, he walked out
of his room, ready to go down-
stairs to his parents' room where
he was sure his father would be
waiting. His mother had to have
made some kind of mistake.
He went to the landing, looked
down and expected to see Steve's
face looking right back up at him.

Instead, he saw Steve's team-
mates from the Hurricanes and
their wives in the family room
and around the kitchen table,
sitting, talking, crying, grieving
together.
Mike just sat, frozen, at the
top of the stairs.
"That was when it sunk in,"
Mike said. "I sat for a second and
then it hit me."
Steve might have been gone,
but the Hurricanes stayed. After
Susan was done calling fam-
ily and talking to the media, she
looked outside her window and
into the street.
There was Mike, Ryan and
about 15 members of the Hur-
ricanes outside playing street
hockey. They had all come to take
the boys' minds off the death, at
least for a little while, in the only
way they knew how.
"(My mom) said it was amaz-
ing to see the people in the com-
munity," Mike said. "She said
it was just a testament to the
Carolina Hurricanes organiza-
tion and whatthey instill in their
players. She said it was just great
to see the support with the trag-
edy that had just taken place."
Steve and Susan never
wanted to push their kids
into doing any sport, but when
Mike decided that he wanted to
devote his time to hockey, they
gave their full support. Like any
attentive parent, Steve would
take Mike and his younger broth-
er Ryan to the rink to master the
basics of skating.
The two would grab onto the
boards or wobble across the ice,
holding onto a chair to keep
themselves from falling. But if
the boys fell down when skat-
ing across center ice, they'd be
sitting on the image of a large,
red winged wheel, looking up at
seven Stanley Cup banners and
more than 19,275 empty seats
while they waited for Steve to
come help them up.
A regular day learningto skate.
at the municipal rink? Nope.
More along the lines of an empty
Joe Louis Arena after the Red
Wings finished practice.

Mike was just 4 years old
during Steve's stint with the
Red Wings, so his early years
in Michigan are still hazy. His
memories of the Hurricanes,
though, are much more vivid.
His family moved to Raleigh,
N.C., in 1998 when Steve left
Detroit after nine years playing
for the Red Wings, when Mike
was six.
For Steve, every weekend in
Raleigh was take-your-kid-to-
work day.
"It was pretty prevalent, just
being in and out of the practice
rink, coming in on Saturdays and
Sundays when he was getting a
workout in," Mike said. "That
would be a memory that stands
out, just me and my brother com-
ing and just looking at how tall
the sticks were, and how big the
gear was."
Mike and Ryan weren't the
only ones hanging around the
practice rink - other players
would bring their kids too. Ron
Francis, current director of
hockey operations of the Caro-
lina Hurricanes and teammate of
Steve's from 1998-99 remembers
how, together, the kids would
run around the arena and crawl
around the locker room.
The kids would even accompa-
ny their dads into the gym, and
as the players exercised on the
bicycles, their children would
mess around on the open equip-
ment.
That's just the way everything
was done. The kids felt just as at
home at Greensboro Coliseum
Complex, where the Hurricanes
played from 1997-99.
During games, they'd con-
gregate in what was called the
"Wives' Room," a room full of
all the family members of the
players. During the game, Mike
watched as intently as any fan
sitting in the arena, following
the puck and keeping track of
when Steve was on the ice. But
the real fun would happen dur-
ingthe intermissions.
"We'd go downstairs and we
would play ministicks with all
the other guys' kids," Mikesaid.

Ben Holden blinked and
did a double take to see if
his eyes were deceiving him.
The CBS Sports college hock-
ey analyst was in Ann Arbor for a
Michigan hockey game in Octo-
ber 2011. He'd covered all the
Michigan greats of the last few
years from T.J. Hensik to Kevin
Porter. But on this 2011-12 team,
a team filled with players who
were on the cusp of a nation-
al championship just months

before, there was one young
defenseman that caught his eye.
There was something about
the way this player, Mike,
hunched his back, crouched his
legs and skated down the ice that
started turning the wheels in
Holden's memory and took him
back about 20 years.
As a hockey enthusiast and
Michigan native, Holden natu-
rally grew up devoted to the
Detroit Red Wings. He'd seen
scores of players pass through
the organization in his life. But
Mike resembled one in particu-
lar - a certain offensive defense-

man who played in Detroit in the
early 1990s.
Steve Chiasson was smart and
steady. He played simple and
hard. He spent 13 years in the
NHL - and Holden was current-
ly watching Steve's eldest son,
Mike, playing in his freshman
campaign for the Wolverines.
For Holden, watching Mike
was like going back in time -
specifically, a time before 1999,
when Steve was killed in a car
crash.

2011, watching what looked like

Not this time for Penn State
as Blue rolls in first round

Daily Sports Editor
CHICAGO - It took the Mich-
igan men's basketball team a full
30 minutes to settle into a com-
fortable 15-point lead against the
Big Ten's worst team, and this
time, the Wolverines held on.
Penn State shot an impres-
sive 48 percent from the field on
the game,
but behind PENN STATE 66
aggressive MICHIGAN 83
play from
the post players, No. 6 Michi-
gan (13-6 Big Ten, 26-6 overall)
knocked the Nittany Lions (2-17,
10-21) from the Big Ten Tourna-
ment in an 83-66 win.
The Wolverines failed to fend
off a late-game comeback by Penn
State the last time these teams
squared off, but Michigan - per-
forming exactly as its "Rise to
the Occasion" warm-up T-shirts
read - kept its composure down
the stretch to fend off the Nittany
Lions.
"(The last game against Penn
State) was obviously in the back
of our head when we were up 15
points with 10 minutes left at
Penn State, and they're capable
of coming back and winning the
game," said sophomore guard
Trey Burke. "We just had to make
sure we did what we needed to do
to pull out the win."
Though Michigan was able to
pad its lead in the second half this
time around, Penn State again
kept the game close right out of
the gates.
The 12th-seeded Nittany Lions
were hot in the first half as they
shot 50 percent from the field by
attacking the interior and feeding
the ball to Sasa Borovnjak, who
got easy layups against redshirt
junior forward Jordan Morgan.
Borovnjak led the Nittany
Lions on an early 14-0 run after
Burke hit a 3-pointer to open the
game, so Michigan coach John
Beilein called a timeout to settle

his team down and find a better
matchup for Borovnjak.
Freshman forward Mitch
McGary checked in and proceed-
ed to dominate the paint. The
freshman had a double-double
in the first half alone - 10 points
and 10 rebounds - and finished
with 10 points and 11 boards.
"That's Mitch McGary," Burke
said. "He's able to come of the
bench and give us a spark. Once
he comes off the bench and gets
the crowd into it - he does that
a lot - that gives us energy. ... He
has the ability to bring a spark
to this team, not only on the
offensive end, but the defensive
end. I think he had six or seven
rebounds within 10 minutes, and
that just shows how much effort
and intensity he plays with."
With McGary seeing extended
minutes, the fifth-seeded Wol-
verines went on a 23-10 run to
gain a comfortable first-half lead,
but the Nittany Lions' hot shoot-
ing kept the game close.
Penn State clicked offensively
in the firsthalf as it has in the past
few games, getting easy layups
both from passes to the interior
to Borovnjak and Ross Travis and
from dribble penetration by D.J.
Newbill.
Though the Nittany Lion
frontcourt combined for 27
points, Beilein noted that most of
Penn State's unique offense runs
through its guards, Newbill and
Jermaine Marshall.
"Marshall and Newbill can
get to anywhere," Beilen said.
"Those two guards, they're two
of the best guards in the league
- that's a big part of (their effi-
cient offense). At the same time,
they're running some really good
stuff. ... We haven't seen a lot of
that action they're runningnow."
Newbill led the Nittany Lions
with 20 points, but Borovnjak and
Travis kept the post play close all
game. Penn State had 44 points in
the paint while Michigan tallied
38, but the Wolverines dominated

on the glass.
While virtually ineffective
rebounding doomed Michigan
against Indiana, its frontcourt
pulled down 36 rebounds against
Penn State, mostly on the offen-
sive end.
Five of McGary's 11 rebounds
came on offense, and Michigan
pulled down 15 total offensive
boards - its second-highest
total all season - en route to 28
second-chance points. Redshirt
sophomore forward Jon Horford
added 11 points and five rebounds
while stepping up to fill Morgan's
minutes, as Morgan got in foul
trouble while struggling to guard
Borovnjak.
While McGary took control
of the first half offensively, the

Wolverine backcourt handled the
offense in the second half. Burke,
junior Tim Hardaway Jr. and
freshman Nik Stauskas tallied a
combined 29 second-half points,
leading the Wolverines offen-
sively with 21, 15 and 15 points,
respectively. Michigan also shot
46 percent from the floor, led by
Burke's 7-for-15 from the field.
All three guards played well
off the ball screen, easily getting
to the basket for layups or mid-
range jumpers and drawing fouls.
Burke and Stauskas were perfect
from the free-throw line, and the
Wolverines shot an impressive 83
percent from the charity stripe.
With the win, the Wolverines
face No. 4 seed Wisconsin on Fri-
day.
