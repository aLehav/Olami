About 60 people convened 

Monday at Palmer Commons for a 
Senate Assembly forum to discuss 
University of Michigan Board of 
Regents candidate platforms for 
the upcoming Nov. 6 election. 

Incumbents 
and 
first-time 

candidates covered topics such as 
financial aid, academic freedom, 
the recent reprimanding of Prof. 
John Cheney-Lippold for his 

refusal of a recommendation 
letter and more throughout the 
event.

The forum was designed to 

On Oct. 3, the Michigan 

state 
government 
and 

Enbridge, a Canadian energy 
transportation 
company, 

announced a plan to replace 
the twin Line 5 oil pipelines 
that run through the Straits of 
Mackinac, a major waterway 
that connects Lakes Michigan 
and Huron. The agreement calls 
for the decommissioning of the 
existing pipeline after a new 
one is built in a tunnel below 

the Straits.

The Line 5 pipelines are 645 

miles long, transporting up to 
540,000 barrels of crude oil and 
natural gas per day. The new 
tunnel would not change the 
volume of oil transported daily.

The project is set to take 

seven to 10 years to complete 
and 
cost 
$350 
million 
to 

$500 million. Enbridge will 
provide all of the funding and 
will continue to pay for the 
operation and maintenance of 
the tunnel for up to 99 years.

“This common-sense solution 

In a meeting that lasted 

past 3 a.m., Ann Arbor City 
Council unanimously passed 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor’s 

proposal 
to 
establish 
the 

Independent 
Community 

Police Oversight Commission 
at 
Monday 
night’s 
Council 

meeting. 

The proposal comes after the 

council voted down a citizen-
led oversight board proposal on 
Oct. 1, citing legal concerns in 
the city charter and Ann Arbor 
Police Department’s collective 
bargaining agreement regarding 
complaints. The citizen task 
force met several times over the 
summer after its establishment 
was finalized in March. Their 
proposal would have granted the 
oversight commission subpoena 
power for records and officer 
testimony as well as the ability to 
investigate complaints against 
the AAPD independently of the 
department.

The 
Independent 

Community Police Oversight 
Commission, 
proposed 
by 

Taylor, gives the mayor the 
power to appoint 11 commission 
members and would be a part of 
city government. The rejected 
citizen-led task force wanted 
to create an 11-member body 
with members appointed by the 
Human 
Rights 
Commission, 

subject to approval by the 

council.

Community 
concerns 

about police oversight have 
increased following issues of 
police brutality across the city, 
including the murder of Aura 
Rosser in 2014 and arrest of 
high schooler Ciaeem Slaton at 
the Blake Transit Center in 2017.

Ann Arbor resident Renee 

Roederer asked the council to 

consider adding a youth member 
to the commission.

“It is so rare for us, their 

elders, 
to 
actually 
hand 

over power, leadership and 
decision-making 
ability,” 

Roederer said. “That seems 
to be magnified when young 
people come from marginalized 
identities and experiences of 
disenfranchisement … our city 

and our nation need to learn 
from our youth and ultimately 
be formed by their leadership.”

City 
Council 
later 

amended 
the 
proposal 
to 

allow 
councilmembers 
to 

appoint a youth liaison to the 
commission. The liaison must 
be an appointed member of the 
“Youth Council,” which the 

Adults with attention deficit 

hyperactivity disorder exhibit 
higher levels of creativity than 
their non-ADHD counterparts 
and rely less on prior knowledge 
when thinking of innovative 
solutions to problems, a University 
of Michigan study says.

The study, conducted by U-M 

Assistant 
Research 
Scientist 

Holly White, asked participants 
with and without ADHD to think 
of and draw fruits that could 
exist in an “alien” society, but 
do not actually grow on earth. 
White found participants with 
ADHD were more likely than 
those without ADHD to invent 
fruits that differed greatly from 
common ones, such as apples and 
bananas.

White said the ability to offer 

inventive answers in response 
to complex problems is an asset 
in many fields, especially in 
areas where students will often 
rely upon previous examples of 
solutions rather than create their 
own. She noted that, for example,

allow students and faculty hear 
each candidate’s position on 
various issues and participate in 
an open Q&A discussion.

The meeting began with 

each of the five candidates 
outlining 
their 
platforms. 

Incumbent 
Regents 
Andrea 

Fischer 
Newman 
(R) 
and 

Andrew Richner (R) spoke 
with 
challengers 
Jordan 

Acker (D), Paul Brown (D) and 
Kevin Graves (Green Party) to 

outline each of their respective 
platforms. There are two open 
seats on the board.

The candidates responded 

to 
questions 
regarding 
the 

nature of academic freedom 
at the University. Newman 
said academic freedom is a 
cornerstone of the University 
and 
should 
be 
treated 

accordingly.

“It’s easy to say that the 

entire 
current 
board 
and 

new 
board 
members 
are 

all 
strong 
supporters 
of 

academic 
freedom. 
I 
think 

it’s the linchpin of any great 

institution and it’s certainly 
made this institution great,” 
Newman said. “I think that 
academic freedom is the basis 
of our institution and without 
it, getting any sort of structure 
of scriptures on something 
would be inappropriate unless 
it was something harmful being 
taught.”

Another 
question 

referenced 
the 
problem 
of 

high and increasing tuition at 
the University. Acker said the 
problem 
is 
worsening 
and 

must be acted upon. Last June, 
the regents voted to increase 

in-state tuition by 2.9 
percent and out-of-state 
tuition by 3.9 percent. 

“We can never be losing 

middle class kids in the 
state of Michigan to out-
of-state schools,” Acker 
said. “That is the bread and 
butter of this institution. I 
think the facts speak for 
themselves. We haven’t 
gotten any closer.”

When asked about how 

the board will handle 
fostering a diverse student 
body, Brown said the Board 
of Regents must act to 
increase student diversity 
instead of assuming it will 
increase on its own. The 
diversity rates for the 
2018 
freshman 
class 

have increased marginally 
since 2017.

“We have to achieve 

(greater 
diversity) 
and 

the numbers continue to 
go down,” Brown said. 
“Whether 
that 
means 

hiring people who are 
from a community to 
live in the community, 
to recruit and prepare 

students 
to 
apply 
to 
the 

University, whether it means 
putting resources in place for 
when those students arrive to 
give them a safe place where 
they can succeed. We have 
to put our money where our 
mouth is. There’s no easy 
solution to a hard problem, but 
there are solutions.”

When 
discussing 
the 

relationship between the three 
University campuses — Ann 
Arbor, Dearborn and Flint — 
Richner said the campuses 
have to do a better job working 
collectively.

“One thing we have to be 

careful about is sharing state 
appropriations because the state 
considers the three campuses 
as independent units,” Richner 
said. “We’re running the risk 
if we start sharing resources 
that that’s going to impact our 
state appropriations negatively 
for this campus in particular, 
but there are opportunities to 
work collectively. We need to 
do more cooperatively.”

The discussion soon shifted 

into the recent reprimanding of 
Cheney-Lippold for denying a 
letter of recommendation for a 
student wishing to study abroad 
in Israel. The University froze 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
sabbatical 

eligibility and credits for two 
years as well as removed his 
eligibility for a salary increase 
for the 2018-2019 school year in 
response to his actions. Board 
members spoke of their opinion 
on the actions of the University 
and were met with further 
questions and concerns from 
the audience.

COLLEGE GAME DAY

Early 
Tuesday 
morning, 

the Ann Arbor City Council 
discussed one of its least 
contentious 
issues: 
the 

domestication of ducks.

City Councilmember Chuck 

Warpehoski, 
D-Ward 
5, 

sponsored an ordinance which 
considers ducks with respect 
to the city of Ann Arbor’s 
current 
policy 
regarding 

animals. 
The 
ordinance, 

awaiting its final approval on 
Nov. 8, would accept ducks as 
animals that can be kept in 
coops and properties in the 
city, in addition to the existing 
policy that allows chickens. 

The current proposal allows 
citizens to apply for a permit 
for ownership of either up to 
two or up to six birds, referring 
solely to chickens for the time 
being.

Foggy air and laser lights 

went 
practically 
unnoticed 

at the Office of Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, 
and 
Transgender 

Affairs ‘Conceptions of Drag” 
show held last night at the 
Michigan League.

What 
captured 
a 
crowd 

of 175 were the ‘stars’ who 
strutted their stuff through the 
glamorous ambiance.

“Betner”, otherwise known 

as Art and Design junior Ben 
Fife, who was dressed in a long 
black dress, dog collar and red 
lipstick, got the crowd roaring.

Fife seduced the audience as 

he lip-synced the sexy 40s-style 
song, “It’s Silk.” Working his 
way through the crowd, Fife 
flirted with several women and 
even invited one up on the stage 
for a dance.

Fife said he had been looking 

forward to the event all year.

“I think it’s really important 

to have a setting where the 

gender 
can 
be 
playdough. 

There’s a lot of pressure at the 

University to assimilate one 
way or the other. It’s important 

to mock the gender assimilation 
concept at large,” he said.

Haruna Madodo, a Music 

junior 
student, 
organized 

the event. “We’re basically 
breaking 
stereotypes 
about 

what gender is. That’s why we 
called it ‘Conceptions of Drag’. 
We usually expect drag queens 
to be men dressed as women. 
That’s society’s ‘norm’.”

The 
gender 
specificities 

of the clothing were more 
up 
for 
scrutinization 
than 

the 
participants’ 
sexualities 

Madodo said. 

Art and design Jenny Boyer 

drew many laughs with her 
lip-synch rendition of “Father 
Hard-On.”

Dressed as a Catholic priest, 

Boyer slowly approached the 
stage with her head bowed 

down as eerie church bells 
and organ music played in the 
background. 

Boyer raised her right hand 

to the sky as two church-goers 
approached and tried to seduce 
her. Finally giving in, Boyer let 
the two girls rip off her sacred 
attire as funky club music 
replaced the organs. 

“I think that I did this 

because there is a lot of 
emphasis on gender roles” said 
Boyer. “I think that gender is 
pointless. We should all fuse 
together as one gender. When 
we look at each other, we 
shouldn’t think of males and 
females, but of humanity,” she 
said. 

Participants in the event 

were 
more 
concerned 
that 

the 
show 
deflect 
society’s 

perception of gender roles than 
make a statement about sexual 
orientation.

Rackham 
second-year 

student Gary Brouhard dressed 
in women’s clothing, but not in 
the glamorous-queen image he 
said society has fabricated. He 
was dressed a school girl, clad 
in knee highs and a plaid skirt. 
Brouhard is not a member of 
LGBT, but feels that clothing is 
unfairly associated with gender 
roles.

“I think that it shows that 

gender roles are things we put 
on, like clothings.”

Brouhard hopes that the 

show encourages other students 
at the University, regardless of 
sexual preference, or just these 
who want to be different, to just 
“come out.”

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: LGBT PAGEANT EXPLORES GENDER NORMS

offers the greatest possible 
safeguards to Michigan’s waters 
while 
maintaining 
critical 

connections to ensure Michigan 
residents 
have 
the 
energy 

resources they need,” Gov. Rick 
Snyder wrote in a press release. 
“The historic agreement will 
result in eliminating nearly 
every risk of an oil leak in the 
Straits 
and 
provide 
added 

protections to the Great Lakes. 
It also will allow for multiple 
utilities to be housed and 
protected, better connecting 
our 
peninsulas, 
improving 

energy security and supporting 
economic 
development. 
The 

taxpayers of Michigan will 
benefit greatly from this project 
but won’t have to pay for it.”

According 
to 
the 
press 

release, the agreement will 
demand Enbridge follow certain 
safety 
measures 
to 
reduce 

risk during construction. The 
measures 
include 
shutting 

down the pipelines when waves 
are high, providing a new radar 
system, maintaining $1.8 billion 
in available funds in case of an 
oil spill and installing cameras 
in the Straits to prohibit ships 
from dropping their anchors 
atop a pipeline.

Both Enbridge and Snyder’s 

administration claim the deal 
is an environmental victory 
because it decommissions the 
existing controversial Line 5 
pipelines and expands safety 
measures for the new tunnel. 
However, critics are wary of 
the environmental implications 
of constructing a tunnel in 
the Straits of Mackinac and 
concerned about the risk of an 
oil spill in the process.

The Straits’ pivotal location is 

a main cause of concern. A spill 
could potentially affect two of 
the five Great Lakes, the largest 
group of lakes on Earth by area. 
The Great Lakes collectively 
house over 20 percent of the 
global supply of surface fresh 
water.

University 
of 
Michigan 

researcher 
Dave 

Schwab 
modeled 
how 
a 

potential oil spill in the Straits 
of Mackinac would impact the 
Great Lakes ecology, wildlife 
and coasts.

“I believe an oil spill from 

Line 5 in the Straits could cause 
severe environmental economic 
and cultural damage over a wide 
area because of the unique water 
flow conditions in the Straits,” 
Schwab said. 

Schwab 
foresees 
at 
least 

three sets of environmental 
implications for the construction 
of the tunnel, beyond the risk 
of an oil spill: the immediate 
effects of the drilling on the 
north and south shores of the 
Straits, 
potential 
geological 

impact on the subsurface in the 
Straits and long-term impact 
to the atmosphere from the 
continued use of any fossil fuels, 
which Line 5 transports.

Schwab said the tunnel would 

eventually be an improvement 
on the existing pipelines, but 
nonetheless extends the lifetime 
of oil transport through the 
Great Lakes.

“The tunnel project would 

eventually result in a lower 
likelihood of an oil spill from 
the Line 5 pipeline, but it 
would prolong the period of 
risk for a spill from the current 
pipeline until the tunnel was 
approved, 
constructed 
and 

made operational, which could 
easily take more than 10 years,” 
Schwab said.

LSA junior Cameron Leitz, 

president 
of 
the 
Program 

in 
the 
Environment 
Club, 

is also concerned about the 
construction of the project, 
fearing it could result in an oil 
spill.

“I’m concerned because this 

plan could create an oil spill in 
the Great Lakes,” Leitz said. 
“The Great Lakes are pristine 
bodies of water that are used 
for recreation and drinking 
water. Freshwater is becoming 
more scarce and it is becoming 
increasingly 
important 

to 
protect 
our 
freshwater 

resources.”

Both 
Leitz 
and 
Schwab 

believe Line 5 should be shut 
down permanently.

“I personally don’t believe 

that the benefits Line 5 provides 
to the people of Michigan are 
anywhere near sufficient to 
justify the risk of an oil spill 
from the pipeline,” Schwab said.

The 
agreement 
between 

Snyder’s 
administration 
and 

Enbridge 
is 
contentious, 

with 
midterm 
elections 
on 

the 
horizon. 
Democratic 

gubernatorial 
candidate 

Gretchen Whitmer has said she 
will shut down Line 5 if elected, 
while Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Bill Schuette has 
endorsed Snyder’s plan.

Leitz 
heavily 
considers 

the environmental policy of 
candidates when voting.

“Climate change and other 

environmental 
problems 
are 

some of the most important 
problems 
facing 
the 
world, 

so I heavily consider each 
candidates’ 
stance 
on 

environmental 
policy,” 
Leitz 

said. “Individual actions are 
great 
for 
helping 
to 
solve 

climate change, but changing 
environmental policy is the only 
way to have a bigger impact on 
solving these problems.”

students 
in 
engineering 
are 

sometimes incapable of producing 
original solutions without some 
form of guidelines for their work.

“If you show them solutions 

that might work, it’s very hard for 
them to come up with new things 
that don’t include those solutions,” 
White said. “A task that I tried 
with students with ADHD was 
to show them examples and say, 
‘Don’t use these examples’ and, 
in fact, they were able to create 
high-quality product labels for 
an imaginary company, and they 
were able to come up with these 
and not use the elements that were 
shown in the examples.”

As a result of her study, White 

concluded 
that 
individuals 

with ADHD are more creative 
when it comes to innovative 
problem-solving. Arash Zaghi, an 
associate professor of civil and 
environmental engineering at the 
University of Connecticut, was 
not involved with the study, but 
has done research on students 
with ADHD in the past. He said 
curiosity 
is 
“domain-specific” 

and cannot be given a blanket 
definition. However, he said the 
intense focus many students with 
ADHD put into work they have a 
keen interest in allows them to 
produce original and complex 
thought.

“When they (individuals with 

ADHD) hyperfocus on something, 
and they have an interest in 
something, the amount of work 
that they can do is just mind 
boggling,” Zaghi said.

James Kaufman, a professor 

of educational psychology at the 
University of Connecticut, also 
mentioned how creativity varies 
by discipline, but is ultimately, 
“the ability to develop something 

that is both new and that is task-
appropriate.”

Kaufman classified creativity 

in four distinct ways: mini-c 
(personal 
insights), 
little-c 

(everyday 
creativity), 
pro-c 

(expert level) and big-c (creative 
genius). Kaufman said the kind of 
creativity exhibited by students 
with ADHD is often undervalued 
because it encourages others to be 
open to newness, which is scary 
for those who are accustomed to 
rhythm and order.

“Creative people are more 

likely to take risks, be open to 
new ideas, defy authority and 
seek challenges, which pays off 
big-time in the long run, but in 
general we’re not great as a society 
at looking at long-term benefits,” 
Kaufman wrote in an email. “Most 
people want a small, measured 
amount of creativity that solves 
small, existing problems.”

junior 
Lena 

Dreves, who has ADHD, said she 
often struggles with disappointing 
parents and teachers because her 
creativity manifests itself in ways 
many perceive to be daydreaming 
and forgetful thinking.

“Walking home from school, 

instead of thinking ‘I need to 
pay rent’ or ‘I need to do that 
homework tonight,’ I’m thinking 
of some historical moment in 
history and how the philosophy of 
a certain leader really affected this 
generation,” Dreves said. “Yes, it’s 
daydreaming and I get that, but 
at the same time, it’s a beautiful 
break for the mind.”

White also said neurodiverse 

perspectives are often seen solely 
as impairments rather than useful 
assets in fields that may actually 
benefit from unique modes of 
thinking.

“I don’t want to say there’s no 

impairment with ADHD, because 
of course it’s going to be something 
where people are having trouble 

focusing and paying attention,” 
White said. “But I want to 
underscore that it’s a different way 
of thinking that, in some contexts 
and for some types of problems, is 
definitely an advantage.”

According to Zaghi, including 

the perspectives and viewpoints 
of students with ADHD is often 
challenging in the short-term, 
but can have long-lasting benefits. 
He said while students with 
ADHD may have some difficulties 
completing certain tasks during 
a 
project, 
their 
ideas 
often 

complement those of students 
without ADHD and enhance the 
overall product.

“We need diverse types of 

skills,” Zaghi said. “Some of the 
students are very task-oriented, 
they 
are 
very 
comfortable 

adhering 
to 
process 
and 

presenting a very refined, polished 
product. We cannot only, for 
example, say ‘ADHD students, 
because they have these creative 
ideas, can produce the best 
product.’ They need to work to get 
there. That’s why we need to have 
a neurodiverse group of students.”

Dreves said another challenge 

she faces is others’ unwillingness 
to legitimize ADHD and see it as 
a real disorder that can have both 
positive and negative effects. With 
the growing use of medication 
such as Adderall and Ritalin 
among 
non-ADHD 
students, 

Dreves said she often has to 
justify her condition to herself and 
actively create her own sense of 
self-esteem.

“It’s forced me to find self-

esteem 
and 
self-value 
inside 

myself,” Dreves said. “That sounds 
really cheesy, but at the same time, 
it’s really real. Because if I put my 
worth on what everyone around 
me is expecting, then it gets 
crushed every time. And I think 
that’s definitely positive.”

the Commission will create 

and oversee. The Youth Council 
will be “composed of youths 
residing in Washtenaw County 
between the ages of 16 and 21.” 
It is unclear if this includes 
temporary University students.

Ann Arbor resident Susan 

Priller, 
who 
identified 

herself as a legal secretary 
at Hooper Hathaway, where 
Taylor practices law, hoped 
city officials would begin to 
aggressively work on the issue.

“I would prefer to think 

that my city officials were 
merely ignorant of the harms of 
aggressive policing rather than 
they were engaging in a wanted, 
egregious disregard of what 
this community has clearly 
asked for,” Priller said. “I would 
hope that they exit their bubble 
of white privilege and that 

they would stop congratulating 
themselves on how liberal they 
are and engage in the hard work 
of anti-racism.”

Priller then handed signed 

copies of the book “The End 
of Policing” by Alex Vitale, 
sociology professor at Brooklyn 
College, to Taylor and City 
Administrator 
Howard 

Lazarus.

The 
Police 
Officers 

Association 
of 

Michigan addressed a letter to 
Taylor dated Sept. 27 requesting 
the task force’s proposal not be 
passed. 

“The preamble of the task 

force proposed ordinance is 
a deplorable rant filled with 
bias and prejudice against law 
enforcement,” the letter signed 
by General Counsel Frank Guido 
read. “To state that the City 
of Ann Arbor ‘acknowledges 
that law enforcement, across 
the nation, have historically 
defended and enforced racism 

and segregation’ is nothing less 
than a direct attack on Ann 
Arbor police officers.”

The 
letter 
also 
stated 

the 
ordinance 
lacks 
moral 

justification and legal grounds.

Much of the discussion of 

the proposal centered around 
whether complainants should 
be able to file their complaints 
about the AAPD anonymously. 
City 
Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, served 
as a non-voting member of 
the task force. She wanted the 
option for anonymity to protect 
residents 
from 
potential 

revictimization, 
which 
was 

included in the passed proposal.

“You should always have 

an 
option 
of 
anonymity,” 

Kailasapathy said. “We keep 
saying we don’t want this 
commission to fail, so if you 
don’t want it to fail, you can’t 
expect people to come and 
do it according to our terms 
which come from a vantage 

point of privilege. The ultimate 
(viewpoint) of this is going to 
be people who are afraid that 
they could be re-victimized as a 
result of this.”

City 
Councilmember 

Graydon Krapohl, D-Ward 4, 
also served as a non-voting 
member of the task force but 
was not present at Monday’s 
meeting.

Another issue raised was 

whether 
AAPD 
should 
be 

informed of or play a role in 
investigating complaints. The 
task force’s proposal would 
have allowed the commission to 
investigate complaints without 
informing 
AAPD. 
Taylor 

believes 
engagement 
with 

police is necessary to create 
change.

“I 
do 
view 
engagement 

with the police about police 
practices as a necessary part 
of the commission learning 
about the practice and policy 
and an important part of that 

communication,” Taylor said. 

Kailasapathy said the task 

force’s ordinance is crucial 
to a democratic checks and 
balances system.

“I think part of having the 

ordinance is to make it clear 
… good people will always 
do things but we cannot be 
at the mercy of good things,” 
Kailasapathy said. “That’s why 
democracy needs institutions 
with checks and balances. It’s 
built into the system.”

The council also debated how 

complaints should be handled 
on the basis of whether they 
are criminal or disciplinary. 
Disciplinary 
complaints 
are 

complaints of behaviors that 
would not violate the law, 
but violate the policies and 
procedures 
of 
the 
AAPD. 

The citizen task force would 
have investigated complaints 
independently.

City 
Attorney 
Stephen 

Postema said all complaints 

should be forwarded to AAPD, 
regardless 
of 
the 
type 
of 

complaint.

Ann Arbor resident Richard 

Friedman, 
co-chair 
of 
the 

citizen-led task force and a 
professor at the University of 
Michigan Law School, said the 
commission should investigate 
matters even if a resident does 
not formally come forward 
with a complaint.

“I think this is something 

that the council can take a shot 
at and worse comes to worst, 
you get a ruling in a particular 
case that can’t happen and you 
go from there,” Friedman said.

AAPD and city employees 

are not eligible for membership 
on the commission in either 
proposal, but the task force’s 
proposal 
extended 
the 

restriction 
to 
any 
former 

employees 
of 
or 
“regular 

contractors” of the city or any 
police department.

using automation to help large 
industries 
like 
construction, 

waste management and real 
estate.

“We 
saw 
this 
large 

opportunity, thinking that data 
and automation is probably the 
most important technological 
trend over the next 20 years,” 
Nahigian said. “And we saw 
this large gap in that most 
venture 
dollars 
were 
going 

towards 
more 
A.I.-focused 

opportunities, meaning really 
hard-core 
technology 
and 

science problems, that are not 
widely used or adopted. We 
saw that a lot of value creation 
is happening and will continue 
to 
happen, 
as 
the 
biggest 

opportunities, in these large 
old-school 
segments 
of 
the 

economy like construction or 
real estate.”

Both 
Nahigian 
and 
Ajao 

have experience starting their 
own companies and investing 
in others. Nahigian previously 
worked at Accel Partners and 
Summit Partners and was an 
investor at Coatue Management. 
Ajao co-founded social media 
company Tuenti, which was 
bought by Telefonica, and Cabify, 
a competitor with Uber in Latin 
America that is now worth $1.4 
billion. Most recently, Ajao was 
at Workday after the company 
acquired his startup Identified, 
where he launched Workday 
Ventures, a fund focused on 
artificial intelligence. During 

this time, Ajao invested in 
several companies, including 
Nahigian’s startup Jobr, a job-
seeking and hiring app.

After 
working 
together 

on Jobr, Ajao and Nahigian 
decided to team up and found 
a venture capital fund focused 
on companies solving problems 

affecting the 99 percent — a 
term contrasted with the top 
1 percent of the wealthiest 
members of society who hold 
and control a large majority of 
resources in the U.S.

“This was four years ago, 

now almost four and a half 
years ago, and TJ and I got to 
know each other pretty well 
through my investment in Jobr,” 
Ajao said. “At the time I was 
already thinking of starting a 
new venture firm because at 
this time I had quite a lot of 
experience investing. I thought 
that there was too much A.I. 
talent in Silicon Valley that 
was being directed towards the 
same problems. And there was 
a need for a new venture firm 
to focus on solving problems 

that were most important to the 
real economy, and what we call 
problems for the 99 percent.”

Base10 
has 
already 

invested in several startups, 
including Yellow, a Brazilian 
mobility 
company 
bringing 

bicycle- 
and 
scooter-sharing 

services to Latin America to 
improve urban sustainability. 
Other companies Base10 has 
supported include The Pill Club, 
which integrates telemedicine 
and pharmaceuticals to deliver 
birth control to subscribers, 
and RoadSync, which eases 
the payment platform for the 
logistics industry.

The news came unexpectedly 

to Ajao, who is half Nigerian and 
was raised in both Nigeria and 
Spain.

“It was a surprise at first,” 

he said. “Just because I never 
really stopped to think about 
it, and assumed that with how 
many years venture capital has 
been around, there must have 
been someone before me that 
had crossed the $100 million 
dollar mark. Once I looked at 
the data, the surprise went 
away, because as you very well 
know, minorities are widely 
underrepresented 
in 
Silicon 

Valley — which is probably why 
there is an inherent bias towards 
focusing on problems for the 1 
percent versus problems for the 
99 percent.”

Nahigian 
emphasized 
the 

need for more diversity in the 
venture capital space, saying for 
Base10 in particular, leadership 
needed to reflect the people 
they were investing to empower. 

Improving 
diversity 
and 

inclusion would be a significant 
part of Base10’s investment in 
the real economy.

“We were setting out just to 

build and scale what we thought 
could be one of the leading 
preeminent 
venture 
capital 

funds focused on this theme,” 
Nahigian said. “Importantly, 
the theme that we’re focused on 
really focuses on diversity and 
inclusion. We’re investing in 
businesses that are going after 
real economy problems, (that) 
have a meaningful impact on 
the 99 percent. And it’s almost 
a shame that that diversity is 
not really reflected in who are 
leading and allocating capital 
within this industry.”

Business junior Devesh Modi 

is a member of the Zell Early 
Stage Fund, a venture capital 
and pre-venture capital fund at 
the Business School under the 
Zell Lurie Institute. For students 
interested 
in 
the 
venture 

capital space, ZESF provides an 
opportunity to gain experience 
investing in real early-stage 
companies. The fund is run 
by 
undergraduate 
business 

students and supervised by a 
faculty managing director.

“ZESF is primarily focused 

on giving undergraduates an 
immersive experience in the 
venture capital due diligence 
process,” Modi said. “While I 
just joined this semester, the 
class is organized into two 
main functions: education and 
deal experience. The education 
side is mixed between student 
and professor-run discussions 

on the fundamentals of due 
diligence 
and 
early-stage 

analysis … On the deal side, our 
professor, Erik Gordon, helps us 
run a full due diligence process 
on the company in question. I 
have not participated in this 
process yet, but from what I 
understand, 
this 
involves 
a 

significant amount of detailed 
research, 
expert 
interviews 

and 
class-based 
discussions 

regarding the legitimacy of the 
company. Once the process is 
completed, the students are 
able to decide whether to invest 
capital. Investments typically 
range between $20,000 and 
$200,000, depending on the size 
and potential of the company.”

Modi 
said 
ZESF 
is 
also 

working 
to 
improve 
their 

outreach efforts to improve 
diversity within the group.

“As 
an 
undergraduate, 
I 

haven’t had much experience 
with the professional venture 
capital 
world,” 
Modi 
said. 

“However, 
based 
on 
my 

experience thus far in ZESF, 
I’ve 
noticed 
that 
there’s 
a 

disproportionately high ratio 
of male to female students. The 
reasons for this vary, but a large 
reason for this has to do with 
the marketing of the club. We 
are currently making amends to 
the process by hosted diversity 
events and women-specific info-
sessions, and are continuing 
to develop our strategies to 
equalize the diversity of the 
class.”

Modi offered some advice on 

entering the startup space with 
a new idea.

“Think it through,” he said. 

“A lot of people come into the 
scene imagining how great their 
ideas will be, but fail to fully 
formulate a concrete plan of 
execution on the business. There 
are a lot of moving components 
when crafting a new company, 
and if done with the partial 
effort it just won’t work.”

On venture capital, Modi 

pointed out the difficulty of 
entering the space as a new 
graduate.

“Venture capital, on the other 

hand, is a difficult field to enter 
right after college,” Modi said. 
“Instead, I’d recommend getting 
involved with something such 
as ZESF to refine their interests 
and understand the field. After a 
few years working in an industry, 
if they’re still interested, that 
would be the time to look at 
options in venture capital.”

Ajao also had advice for 

students: 
to 
focus 
on 
real 

world problems and to apply 
technology to solve problems 
that affect the people they know.

“What I would recommend 

is to not get distracted by 
very shiny words like A.I. 
or blockchain — which are 
fantastic 
technologies,” 
Ajao 

said. “Focus on how that can be 
applied to a problem that you 
face day-to-day, and a problem 
that is extremely authentic to 
you or to your family, because 
that is where the secret sauce 
is going to come. Because at the 
end of the day, founders that are 
successful are solving problems 
that they know better than 
anyone else.”

T

hough Facebook is the most 
commonly cited bad guy 
when it comes to misuse 
of its users’ personal information, 
especially in the wake of the 
Cambridge Analytica scandal or the 
recent breach affecting 50 million 
accounts, this week Google joined 
its ranks following a massive data 
exposure incident of its own.
The main issue with this recent 
data incident is not its size or the 
fact that it even happened at all. 
The ethical problem with Google’s 
treatment of this incident is that it 
withheld 
information 
pertaining 
to the safety and well-being of 
consumers’ data long after the 
incident had occurred. In the future, 
let us curtail the hegemony of these 
corporations and put more power 
in the hands of regulators and 
individuals to shift the balance and 
put users more in control over their 
own data.
In March of this year, internal 
investigators at Google found a 
software glitch in the Google+ social 
network platform that exposed the 
private information of hundreds 
of thousands of users. Google’s 
legal and policy staff at the time 
recommended not notifying users for 
fear of increased regulatory scrutiny 
and public backlash. Though the 
incident cannot be called a breach 
because there were no signs of abuse, 
it still shows negligence on the part 
of Google toward its users’ personal 
information. As part of the current 
response to the incident, Google has 
announced the closure of Google+, 
finally putting an end to its failed 
attempt at challenging Facebook as 
the dominant social platform.
So what exactly is a data breach? 
What companies are really trying 
to prevent in such an event is the 
infiltration of a computer network 
by 
either 
insiders 
or 
remote 
cybercriminals. In the case of 
Cambridge Analytica, Facebook — as 
a business practice — knowingly gave 
away the data of its users to a third 
party, whereas in the recent Google+ 
incident a privacy task force known as 
Project Strobe conducted a company-
wide audit of its software and found 
the bug in the Google+ code, which 
Google then decided to hide from the 
public.
The unfortunate truth is that 

data exposures are very difficult, 
if not impossible, to prevent. Every 
company that does business on the 
internet is vulnerable, and no matter 
how much companies spend, hackers 
always find a way. In a speech given 
last August at the University of 
Georgia, Rick Smith, former CEO of 
the credit agency Equifax, ominously 
said, “There’s those companies that 
have been breached and know it, and 
there are those companies that have 
been breached and don’t know it.” 
A few weeks later, Equifax reported 
to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission 
that 
the 
personal 
data of approximately 143 million 
U.S. consumers — including social 
security numbers, names, birth 
dates and more — had been stolen by 
hackers.
We cannot hope to eradicate 
cybercrime altogether, but it is 
possible for companies to be more 
transparent about how they process 
user data. Especially in the event of 
exposure, consumers should have 
the right to know if they are at risk. 
Furthermore, they should have the 
ability to manage what they share and 
how their information is transferred 
to third parties.
Thankfully, more oversight by 
consumers and governments seems 
to be the trend in the regulatory 
landscape. Under the European 
Union General Data Protection 
Regulation, “Data subjects” must 
provide “unambiguous” consent to 
collect and process personal data, and 
that consent must be free, correctable 
and reversible, meaning consumers 
can modify or even stop the collection 
of certain types of data. The new 
regulation also puts in place strict 
penalties for companies that do not 
disclose a breach within 72 hours. 
The strict rules of this legislation 
aim to give more control over the 
treatment of personal information to 
the user and hold companies more 
accountable in cases of negligence.
Another 
common 
theme 
in 
recent incidents of data exposure 
is large processors of data such 
as Facebook or Google exporting 
information to third parties without 
the knowledge of data subjects. In 
the case of Facebook, the political 
consulting firm Cambridge Analytica 
exploited users’ profile information 
to influence the 2016 U.S. election 

without the consent of users. After 
the scandal, Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg commented on limiting 
the access of its credential-based 
application programming interfaces, 
which makes user data available 
to app developers with the proper 
permission. The danger of loosely 
restricted application programming 
interfaces, especially those related 
to personal information, is that bad 
actors posing as app developers 
can gain access for unauthorized 
purposes.
While companies should not have 
to notify users of every single move 
they make, any transfer of their users’ 
personal data is worthy of notice. 
Consumers had no idea that any of 
these data transfers were taking place 
before it was reported in the news. 
Google, on the other hand, had been 
sitting on this information for months, 
perhaps waiting out the Cambridge 
Analytica firestorm. Companies have 
little incentive on their own to release 
this kind of information, so the fight 
for more transparency about use of 
personal data has to come from us, 
with the support of more stringent 
regulation such as the General Data 
Protection Regulation.
But relying on user consent poses 
practical problems. It would be 
extremely annoying to read over 
the terms and conditions for every 
new app, and that is exactly what 
companies want. We have been 
trained to accept everything and 
question nothing when it comes to 
the transfer of our sensitive personal 
information, but as a consequence 
we have given companies free reign 
to engage in whatever activities 
they want. In this unbalanced 
environment, governments must 
step in to reign in companies’ 
monopoly of control over personal 
information and be a defender of 
users. On a business-wide level, 
a data breach represents a public 
relations headache and the loss of 
revenues, whereas for individuals 
they can have life-changing effects. 
It is time that we acknowledge the 
misuse of our personal information 
by tech giants and strive for greater 
control of our digital lives.

T

wo years ago, the day after 
the presidential election, the 
atmosphere at the University 
of 
Michigan 
was 
astonishingly 
somber. Students and teachers alike 
were visibly upset, with some crying, 
and many unable to concentrate 
on class at all. It seemed as though 
every student was only talking about 
the outcome of the election and the 
impending inauguration. However, 
many professors chose to simply 
ignore that the election had happened 
and ignored the students who tried 
to discuss the election, going on to 
teach the class as though nothing had 
happened.
It’s likely that these professors 
did not want to discuss the election 
either because they were upset 
themselves and did not want to think 
about the outcome, or because they 
were happy about Trump being our 
president-elect and did not want to 
receive backlash from the students, 
who are largely liberal and anti-
Trump. However, I felt upset with 
my professors for not speaking about 
the election — I didn’t understand 
how they could pretend there was 
nothing happening when students 
were clearly upset and looking for 
some kind of reassurance from others. 
I feel professors have an obligation to 
address current events during class.
I don’t believe instructors who 
do not agree with me on political or 
social events should not speak about 
current events affecting students. 
When there was the contentious 
debate 
about 
whether 
white 
supremist Richard Spencer should 
come to the University to speak, only 
a few of my instructors spoke about 
the issue. While a couple of them 
expressed their disappointment in 
the University’s inability to deny 
Spencer the opportunity to speak on 
campus, one of my instructors told us 
he supported Spencer’s right to speak 
on campus in the name of free speech 
and asked us what we thought.
While I am a firm believer that 
Spencer, or any other figure who 
may seek to invalidate students’ 
identities and make them feel unsafe, 
should not be allowed to speak on 
campus, I appreciated that some of 
my instructors, including the one I 
disagreed with, acknowledged an 
issue that had been at the forefront 
of many students’ minds. Even 

if one of my instructors did not 
agree with me, his openness to 
discussing a contentious issue that 
affected students reassured me 
that he was willing to go beyond his 
obligation to teach us coursework 
and acknowledge certain events may 
affect his students’ mental health and 
ability to focus on the class.
I understand this might not 
be possible for certain classes: for 
lectures that have hundreds of people 
and are on a strict schedule, it might 
be hard to facilitate a short discussion 
about the many events that affect the 
United States. Smaller discussion 
sections and seminars might also be 
uncomfortable settings to discuss 
controversial events, because having 
a debate in classes with fewer people 
can feel uncomfortably intimate and 
awkward.
In addition, many students and 
instructors do not want to think about 
upsetting issues when attending 
class and would rather focus on their 
coursework and have a break from 
the political and social strife of the 
United States. In this case, perhaps a 
message on Canvas or an email would 
be a better option — however, even if 
professors do not choose to discuss 
every contentious event that occurs 
during the school year, it’s important 
professors ensure their students 
know they aware of impactful events 
outside of class. This way, instructors 
communicate to their students they 
genuinely care about events that affect 
students and their well-being, rather 
than just their academic performance.
A currently contentious topic 
among students is Brett Kavanaugh’s 
recent confirmation to the Supreme 
Court. None of my instructors have 
acknowledged that the confirmation 
even happened. One of my professors 
was very amenable to discussing 
it during office hours, and she 
acknowledged the situation while 
giving a trigger warning about one 
of our readings that had content 
involving sexual assault. If she hadn’t, 
however, I think the entire case would 
have seemed surreal because it’s so 
easy to read the news that affects the 
entire country, yet at the same time, 
feel isolated. While I did watch parts 
of the hearing, read the news and 
even watch the Saturday Night Live 
“Kavanaugh Hearing Cold Open” skit 
with Matt Damon, because none of 

the figures of authority in school were 
addressing the topic at all, it seemed 
as though the case wasn’t actually 
happening.
A reason most of my instructors 
have not discussed Kavanaugh at all 
might have to do with the current 
controversy involving U-M Associate 
Professor John Cheney-Lippold and 
Graduate Student Instructor Lucy 
Peterson. Both instructors refused 
to write recommendation letters for 
students who wish to study abroad 
in Israel and are being met with 
harsh criticism, both from the people 
affiliated with the University and 
from people who had simply heard or 
read the news. Despite the backlash, 
many 
people 
also 
believe 
the 
instructors had the right to refuse the 
letters, and the news sparked a debate 
in the comments section of various 
articles about the Israel-Palestine 
conflict.
Of course, it’s also possible that 
my instructors simply don’t have an 
opinion about the events occurring 
in the news, or do not feel as though 
they know enough to speak about 
it. However, it’s hard to believe they 
don’t know what’s happening, and 
it’s even harder to believe they don’t 
have an opinion. While it is their job 
as instructors to educate others, they 
also have an obligation to educate 
themselves, especially on events that 
affect their students both negatively 
and positively. Just as students are 
expected to be aware of events that 
happen outside of the classroom, 
instructors should also hold themselves 
to the same responsibilities.
There may be a whole myriad of 
reasons why instructors do not want 
to discuss current issues during their 
class, but it’s getting harder to act like 
nothing’s happening when there are 
so many changes happening, not just in 
the United States but also in the world. 
In order to be more in touch with their 
students and make them feel as though 
the school cares about how certain 
events may be affecting their mental 
health, it is imperative that instructors 
who have the most direct contact with 
students facilitate discussions and 
address events, as contentious as they 
may be.

Protecting your personal information

I

n my capacity as a graduate 
student instructor of political 
science at the University of 
Michigan, I recently declined to 
recommend a student to a study 
abroad program in Israel. Before 
explaining this choice, here is a 
bit about me: My primary role 
at the University is as a student 
of political theory. In addition 
to my scholarship, I serve as an 
assistant teacher for courses in 
political science, an aspect of my 
education that I cherish. I am also a 
Jewish woman. My choice reflects 
my pedagogical commitments to 
educational equity, commitments 
that align with the University’s 
larger mission.
Israel routinely discriminates 
against 
and 
bans 
Palestinian-
Americans, which means many of 
my Palestinian students would be 
denied study abroad opportunities 
available to other students. I would 
not write a letter of recommendation 
for any program that discriminates 
and does not share the University’s 
commitment to equal opportunity 
for all community members. By 
choosing not to contribute to Israel’s 
discriminatory 
practices, 
I 
am 

defending equality and justice for 
Palestinians.
My action attests to my ongoing 
engagement with the theory and 
practice of social justice pedagogy as 
well as my concern for the injustices 
suffered by Palestinians. I have 
been trained at various teaching 
workshops, hosted under the banner 
of the University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion initiative, to teach in a 
way that supports all my students. In 
my classroom, I try to make as much 
space as possible for intellectual and 
political disagreement and for the 
voices of marginalized students. As 
University President Mark Schlissel 
and Provost Martin Philbert’s recent 
statement encourages, I actively 
work to create an “environment 
where everyone is given a chance to 
succeed”. In this instance, taking my 
training seriously meant that I could 
not support a program that was not 
equally accessible to all my students.
Supporting freedom, justice 
and equality for all is a Jewish 
value, 
and 
Jews 
everywhere 
should be free to criticize Israel 
when its policies violate these 
values. To be clear, the state of 
Israel and Judaism are not one 

and the same. Conflating Judaism 
and 
Israel 
marginalizes 
and 
erases those Jews, both Israeli and 
not, who do not feel represented 
by Israel. Furthermore, it does not 
acknowledge the many non-Jews 
living in Israel who are not treated 
as equals.
I chose to articulate my 
reasoning to this student rather 
than hide behind other reasons. 
I made this choice in the spirit 
of honest and deeply personal 
intellectual 
exchange. 
I 
take 
my role as an educator at this 
institution 
very 
seriously. 
I 
am 
committed 
not 
only 
to 
disseminating 
information 
as 
an expert but also to learning 
through my teaching. Thus, I treat 
my students with great respect, 
see them in many ways as my equal 
and approach their questions with 
honesty. In my own experience as 
a student, I have been empowered 
and inspired by teachers who 
have treated me this way. I am 
honored to follow their pedagogic 
examples.

Instructors, it’s time to speak up

rett 
Kavanaugh 
has 
now been sworn in to 
the 
Supreme 
Court, 
ending 
a 
lengthy 
and 
contentious 
nomination process. 
Now, the focus turns 
to a battle that voters 
will determine: the 
2018 
midterms. 
The day for which 
Democrats 
have 
longed, 
and 
many 
Republicans dreaded, 
since 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
election is now only three weeks 
away and the stakes are massive 
for both sides.
For 
the 
Democratic 
Party, 
the past two years have brought 
stunning 
electoral 
triumphs, 
including Doug Jones’s and Conor 
Lamb’s special election victories, 
as well as repeated legislative 
defeats, such as the Republican 
Party passing tax reform and the 
confirmation of two staunchly 
conservative associate justices to 
the Supreme Court.
Democrats, myself included, 
have long maintained that the 
majority of the country opposes 
Trump and Republican rule. We 
point to Trump’s 2.8 million vote 
deficit in the popular vote, his 
negative approval ratings and 
the public’s dismal view of his 
character. This belief has become 
the central pillar of Democratic 
opposition to Trump’s agenda. 
Should Democrats fail to make 
substantial gains in the midterms, 
this mantra will be dispelled, and 
gone with it will be the Democrats’ 
already limited ability to resist 
Trump’s agenda. Fair or not, this 
midterm cycle will be interpreted 
as a referendum on Trump’s 
mandate to rule. Put simply, 
Democrats cannot afford to lose.
Despite 
expectations 
of 
a 
blue wave, Democrats cannot 
merely rely on the historical 
trend of the opposition gaining 
seats during the midterms. Both 
parties 
gerrymandered 
the 
Congressional maps during the 
2010 redistricting process, but due 
to the GOP’s dominance of state 
legislatures, Republicans were able 
to gerrymander roughly four times 
as many districts as Democrats 

meaning Democrats will have to 
win many seats that have tilted 
right in recent years in order to 
retake the House of 
Representatives.
In 
the 
Senate, 
the 
Democrats 
face 
an 
extremely 
challenging 
electoral 
map. 
Democrats 
are 
defending 
26 
seats, 
compared to only nine 
for Republicans, severely 
limiting 
opportunities 
for 
gains. 
These 
structural disadvantages 
require Democrats to pursue a 
focused and deliberate strategy 
to retake the House and, at the 
very least, minimize losses in the 
Senate.
First, Democrats must suspend 
the intra-party civil war between 
the center-left mainstream and the 
more liberal populist wing. This 
conflict has raged rather bitterly 
for the past two years, from the 
election of a new Democratic 
National 
Committee 
in 
2017 
to primary battles throughout 
the past summer. Now that the 
primaries are over, Democrats 
must rally behind the party 
nominees. In 2016, a tenth of 
Bernie 
Sanders’s 
supporters 
ended up voting for Trump in the 
general election, which quite likely 
cost Hillary Clinton the election. 
Put bluntly, this cannot happen 
again. In competitive districts 
where 
mainstream 
Democrats 
defeated left-wing populists in 
the primaries, such as Kansas’s 
third district and California’s 
25th, progressives must swallow 
their pride and support the party’s 
nominee in November (the same 
goes for centrists in districts where 
progressive 
challengers 
beat 
establishment-backed candidates, 
such as New York’s 14th district).
From an issue perspective, 
Democrats would do well to keep 
the focus on Trump, immigration 
and health care, and away from 
the economy. Republicans’ failed 
attempt to repeal The Affordable 
Care 
Act, 
the 
separation 
of 
immigration families and the 
termination of the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrivals policy are 
among the GOP’s most unpopular 
initiatives; all are salient issues that 

will mobilize voters.
Though 
it 
may 
seem 
counterintuitive to deemphasize 
the economic issues, a recent 
Gallup poll found only 12 percent 
of the electorate believes the 
economy is the nation’s most 
important issue — the lowest level 
in decades. Furthermore, while 
the majority of gains from the 
GOP’s remastered tax code have 
gone to the wealthy, the economy 
is still very strong overall — and 
is perhaps the GOP’s best hope 
to preserve their Congressional 
majorities.
Interestingly, despite a strong 
plurality opposing the Senate’s 
decision to confirm Kavanaugh, 
the controversial vote does not 
necessarily help Democrats. In 
North Dakota, Democratic Sen. 
Heidi 
Heitkamp 
tumbled 
in 
the polls after announcing her 
opposition to Kavanaugh, shifting 
the race from a toss-up to a 
Republican lean.
Lastly, Democrats must appeal 
to 
independents. 
While 
the 
Republican base has coalesced 
around Trump and is even 
showing signs of enthusiasm 
for the upcoming elections, a 
majority of independents have 
remained 
decidedly 
opposed 
to Trump and his conservative 
agenda. Still, independents can 
be a fickle demographic and 
polls show a substantial portion 
are still undecided on which 
party to support this November. 
Left-wing enthusiasm is not 
enough given the structural 
disadvantages Democrats face, 
but if Democrats can capitalize 
on independents’ dissatisfaction 
and appeal to the center, they 
will have an excellent chance 
of winning back at least partial 
control of Congress.
For two years now, Democratic 
leaders 
and 
the 
left-leaning 
portion of the public have pledged 
an electoral firestorm in response 
to 
Trump 
and 
congressional 
Republicans’ 
policies 
and 
initiatives. The homestretch of the 
2018 midterms are here, and while 
the task ahead will not be easy, it’s 
time to deliver.

Why I declined to write a letter of recommendation

I read “Anna Karenina” on 
the school bus when I was 
13. I took it a chapter a ride, 
shining a flashlight I kept in 
my backpack over the pages in 
the winter when the mornings 
were dark. It was my favorite 
part of the day — a stolen quiet 
moment, with just me and 
Anna and Kitty and Vronsky. I 
knew pretty much immediately 
that this would become the 
best book I would ever read, 
and even though 13-year-old 
me was wrong about a lot of 
things (I wore a lot of vests that 
year), I was right about this. 
The book grabbed at my heart 
in a way few pieces of writing 
— or anything, for that matter 
— have since. It made me feel 
full — like I was about to burst 
with all the feelings it incited 
in me. When I finally finished 
it, huddled under the covers at 
3:00 in the morning, I cried for 
an hour, hugging the book tight 
to my chest. I woke up the next 
morning still holding it.
I’ve read “Anna Karenina” so 
many times that I’ve lost track 
of the number in the six years 
since that first encounter. It’s 
like my Bible, and I keep it by my 
bed for emergencies. The book 
is high melodrama — a story of 
infidelity, passion gone wrong, 
obsession, 
life, 
death 
and 
suicide. It’s grand enough that 
the most recent film adaptation 
placed the whole thing on a 
stage, putting the theatrics of 
the story to the foreground. But 
despite the opulence and drama 
of it all, Tolstoy’s magnum opus 
remains the most achingly 
human story I’ve ever read. The 
characters are so fragile, so 
delicately spun to life it’ll break 
your heart.
It took me a couple rereads to 
be able to see the cracks running 
between lines of the story 
proper, but eventually I saw 
that “Anna Karenina” exists 
in two dimensions. There’s the 
famous narrative of adultery 
and obsession and divorce and 
twisted love. But then there’s 

also this complicated web of 
the 
characters’ 
interiorities 
running in between all of that, 
filling in those cracks. It’s not 
till the very end of the book that 
you realize the two layers are 
inextricable, how the minutiae 
of the characters’ thoughts and 
feelings and interactions stack 
on top of each other to create 
such a towering tragedy. In the 
end, it was her inner world that 

ruined Anna. She just couldn’t 
stand the weight of her feelings.
An early scene, shortly after 
Anna and Vronsky first meet: 
“She felt as though her nerves 
were strings being strained 
tighter and tighter on some 
sort of screwing peg. She felt 
her eyes opening wider and 
wider ... something within 
oppressing her breathing, while 
all shapes and sounds seemed 
in the uncertain half light to 
strike her with unaccustomed 
vividness.”
Or this moment later on that’s 
not even a scene; it’s really 
more of an offhand description, 
but it’s one of my favorite lines 
of any book I’ve ever read. Kitty 
is lying in bed after she realizes 
the scope of her feelings for 
Levin, and it goes like this: “‘It’s 
late, it’s late,’ she whispered 
with a smile. A long while she 
lay, not moving, with open eyes, 
whose brilliance she almost 
fancied she could herself see in 
the darkness.”

I feel so holy about this. 
Sometimes when I read these 
moments in “Anna Karenina” I 
feel like I’m intruding, like it’s 
too intimate being privy to these 
intricacies of the characters’ 
most 
private 
thoughts. 
It’s 
hard to explain why my heart 
tightens whenever I read these 
moments, except maybe to say 
that it feels like a mirror being 
held up to the inside of my own 
brain. It’s just true, in a way 
that goes beyond relatability, 
but down to the bone marrow 
of what it feels like to be a 
person, to be this specific type 
of person.
Because it’s just not that I 
relate to Kitty. I’ve been Kitty, 
young 
and 
vulnerable 
and 
lying in the dark with my heart 
racing, feeling my eyes shining 
so bright I could imagine them 
brilliant enough to light up the 
room. I’ve been Anna feeling 
my nerves tighten with every 
passing breath, like the colors 
around me are too bright, like 
my body is a live wire being 
wound up.
Those 
moments 
woven 
throughout the story are what 
make “Anna Karenina” the 
book that taught me I have a 
whole internal world, secret 
and entirely separate from 
anybody else’s expectations or 
opinions of me. I’m so grateful 
I found it when I was 13, a time 
when every day contained what 
felt like a million punches in the 
gut. I spent — and still spend, 
as I think every young woman 
does — too much time paring 
down the jagged edges of my 
personality, my body, my whole 
self. It’s what so many girls 
do. Hate ourselves and hurt 
ourselves and hack ourselves 
into neat pieces that can fit 
into the tiny boxes built for us 
to live in, until we can’t take it 
anymore. A lot of girls survive 
it but some, like Anna, don’t. 
“Anna Karenina” gave me 
the language to articulate the 
moments — so rare and tenuous 
that noticing them is like 
pinning a butterfly’s wings — 
when I can feel the full capacity 
of all the secrets I carry, all the 
things I want to do and feel 
and be. Kitty felt it lying awake 
in her room, 
fully 
aware 
of herself and 
her 
shining 
eyes. 
Lorde 
sings 
about 
it in “Writer 
in the Dark”: 
“And 
in 
my 
darkest hour / 
I stumbled on a 
secret power.” 
Fiona Apple, in 
“Every 
Single 
Night”: “I just 
wanna 
feel 
everything 
/ 
So I’m gonna 
try to be still 
now.” 
Kesha, 
in “Rainbow”: 
“Now 
I 
can 
see the magic 
inside of me.” 
And 
Virginia 
Woolf, in “The 
Waves”: “I feel 
a 
thousand 
capacities 
spring 
up 
in 
me.”
The shining 
eyes, 
the 
power, 
the 
magic, 
the 
capacities 
— 
they’re 
all 
just 
different 
names for that 
same flash of 
understanding, 
that 
moment 
of 
vivid 
awareness 
when you can 
see 
yourself 
clearly for the 
first 
time 
in 
forever.
Anna 
wonders, as she 
feels 
herself 
unraveling 
in 
real time, “Is it 
really possible 
to tell someone 
else what one 
feels?”

Imagine the hottest, most 
humid day of the summer. One 
of those days where the air feels 
like jelly, and it’s easy to sit in 
front of the A / C unit for hours, 
watching the air blow in and out. 
You’re sitting on the porch of a 
cottage near some body of water, 
listening to the cicadas buzz 
loudly through the evening’s 
soft glow. A radio is playing 
inside the house, faintly muted 
Americana flowing through the 
open screen door that’s torn in a 
few places. You take a sip of beer, 
lean back in your rocking chair 
and fade into the night, staring 
off at nothing in particular, 
comforted and happy. This is 
what it’s like to listen to Kurt 
Vile’s new record Bottle It In: an 
aimlessly successful collection 
of psychedelic folk that captures 
the happiness of uncertainty 
in amber, sunlight shining 
through even its darkest 
moments.
From the beginning of his 
career, Vile has truly proven 
himself to be the king of good 
vibes, consistently pushing 
out mellow jams that give 
listeners a glimpse into his 
rambling mind. Between his 
skill for fingerpicking, hazy 
psychedelia and his country 
drawl, 
the 
songwriter’s 
penchant for creating mood 
is unmatched on Bottle It In, 
a record that is as meaningful 
as it is irresolute. Kurt 
Vile’s seventh solo album is 
patchworked together, yet 
that’s its greatest asset. At 
face value, Bottle It In seems 
haphazard 
— 
each 
song 
follows its own twisting 
path through Vile’s psyche, 
stumbling upon nuggets of 
wisdom and funny quips alike 
in an endless daze. The warm 
ambiance of Vile’s music is 
present in all of his albums, 
but here he has achieved 
a 
perfect 
balance: 
His 
untethered consciousness is 
both amplified and grounded 
by expansive arrangements 
of guitar and harp.
“I was on the ground 
but looking straight into 
the sun / But the sun went 
down and I couldn’t find 
another one / For a while,” 
he sings on album highlight 
“Bassackwards,” a tangential 

thought that freezes one summer 
moment in time. The virtue of 
Vile’s music is in his stream of 
consciousness, one that can go 
from “Oh girl, you gave me rabies 
/ And I don’t mean maybe” in 

“Hysteria” to the “Don’t tell them 
/ That you love them / For your 
own sake” of title track “Bottle It 
In” and make the two lines just as 
heartfelt. Though Bottle It In may 
cover love, friendship, loneliness 
and 
everything 
in 
between, 
the tie between every song is 
Vile’s 
honesty 
with 
himself 
and his audience. The singer is 
unabashedly on-brand in sound 
and subject matter throughout 
the record, and it works for him 

— the ephemeral quality of his 
ambient guitar and off-hand 
lyrics veer from bright to solemn 
quickly, but everything rests on a 
foundation of truth.
It can often be said that the 
first three minutes of a Kurt Vile 
song will tell you enough about 
it to stop paying attention. For 
those who only appreciate his 
music for its chill nature and 
sweet guitar riffs, this is easy to 
accept, to turn it on and zone out. 
Of course, this is part of Vile’s 
allure — but beneath the reverb 
and soft percussion is a poignant 
message of accepting life as it 
comes. To him, life is “just like 
a song if the repeats were long” 
(“One Trick Ponies”), and he 
has a point. Everyone is floating 
through the years just like Vile 
moves from one atmospheric jam 
to the next trying to find his own 
sun, watching it fade into the 
horizon and waiting for the dawn 
to come back again.

and curious of why choices 
were 
made. 
I 
specifically 
remember, as a dancer, you’re 
very 
consumed 
with 
your 
individual 
performance 
or 
role. I wanted to expand 
my mindset but stay in the 
same art form. Directing is 
something I’ve always wanted 
to do; as a child, I was putting 
on shows in my garage and 
selling tickets for a quarter. 
Putting on a performance is 
something I’ve always done.
TMD: 
One 
of 
the 
choreographers you highlight 
in this fall program is Ohad 
Naharin, 
an 
artist 
you’ve 
worked with frequently. What 
has it been like working with 
him all these years?
GE: I’ve known Ohad for 
30 years and it gives me great 
satisfaction to have my dancers 
take part in such significant 
work. ‘Decadence Chicago,’ 
the 
piece 
choreographed 
especially for our company, 
is a wonderful journey from 
beginning to end.
TMD: Do you think it has 

become easier for your dancers 
to work with Naharin’s style 
over the years?
GE: 
Absolutely. 
We’ve 
performed so many of his 
works, between ‘Minus 16’ in 
2000 and ‘Decadence Chicago’ 
in 2018. In those 18 years, we’ve 
had a new work from Ohad 
every two or three years. That 
development and investment is 
wonderful to see.
TMD: 
Your 
second 
performance includes Emma 
Portner; what has it been 
like working with such an 
emerging artist?
GE: 
She’s 
incredibly 
imaginative. 
She’s 
recently 
got into a whole concept 
of 
environmental 
issues, 
so her participation in this 
evening includes her feelings 
towards the Earth, how to 
make it sustainable and how 
we treat each other through 
our 
connection 
with 
the 
Earth. I love finding new 
choreographers that are just 
at the brink of starting their 
career. Emma is now booming 
and is being sought after all 
over; she (has) dabbled in so 
many 
different 
areas already at 
such a young age.
TMD: 
Movement 
Art Is is also 
focused on our 
relationship with 
the environment. 
Would you say 
the combination 
of Emma Portner 
and 
Movement 
Art Is has made 
Saturday’s 
performance 
take 
on 
an 
environmental 
theme?
GE: Yes, it has. 
Movement 
Art 
Is 
participated 
in the Standing 
Rock Pipeline Protest, and 
they’re depicting the narrative 
they learned from an Indian 
tribe in North Dakota through 
their dance. It’s unusual to 
see these hip-hop artists (Jon 
Boogz and Lil Buck), known 

for their style of juking and 
popping and locking, to go into 
a creative narrative piece.
TMD: Do you think Third 
Coast Percussion has fit well 
with your company’s style?
GE: I’ve wanted to work with 
them for many years. We’re of 
like mind: We’re both open-
minded 
and 
collaborative. 
We’re flexible and can go with 
ideas that have been thrown 
out and enhance them instead.
TMD: 
As 
an 
artistic 
director, 
where 
does 
your 
inspiration come from?
GE: It comes from all over. 
It can be from a conversation, 
something I’ve read, a video, 
a movie. My intent artistically 
is 
to 
keep 
the 
company 
relevant. ‘What’s going on 
in the moment?’ is always 
something 
I 
ask 
myself. 
We’re forever evolving and 
changing — sometimes you hit 
the mark and sometimes you 
don’t. We’re an experimental 
company and we’re always 
going to be exploring what’s 
next.
TMD: 
What 
are 
you 
expecting from this Ann Arbor 
crowd?
GE: 
I’d 
like 
the 
public 
to 
walk away and 
still be thinking 
about the piece. 
I want them to 
feel 
something 
beyond just that 
moment. I don’t 
want 
them 
to 
leave and hear 
someone 
saying 
to their friend, 
‘What 
do 
you 
want to eat for 
dinner?’ 
They 
should 
still 
resonate with the 
work days after 
the performance.

“Two

Programs” 
will 
run at the Power Center this 
Friday and Saturday at 8:00 
p.m. A free Q&A will follow 
both performances (you must 
have a ticket to the show to 
attend).

Art is a valuable source of 
individual expression, but it’s 
an equally important force 
for social change. Towering 
murals 
on 
the 
streets 
of 
Detroit, songs sung by political 
dissonants and defiant protest 
art 
painted 
onto 
cracked 
cardboard for the March for 
Our Lives are testaments to 
this. Hubbard Street Dance 
Chicago, in collaboration with 
the University Musical Society 
(UMS), returns to the Power 
Center this fall with “Two 
Different Programs,” to use 
contemporary dance as their 
personal appeal for action.
Hubbard 
Street 
Dance 
Chicago was founded in 1977 
and is in its 9th season under 
the artistic direction of Glenn 
Edgerton. The modern dance 
company molds their dance 
around changing social issues 
and is known for providing 
collaborative 
opportunities 

with up-and-coming artists. 
“Two Different Programs” is 
no exception.
Oct.

presents 
“Decadance/Chicago,” 
a 
collaboration 
with 
iconic 
Israel-based 
choreographer 
Ohad Naharin, known for his 
distinct gaga style of dance 
and his famous piece “Minus 
16.” Oct. 20 brings 23-year-
old viral choreographer Emma 
Portner and Movement Art 
Is, an organization that aims 
to use movement as a form of 
social education. Live music 
from Grammy-winning group 
Third Coast Percussion and a 
composition by Devonté Hynes 
adds an innovative touch to 
Saturday’s performance.
In a phone interview with 
The Daily, Glenn Edgerton

Chicago’s fall program and his 
time as an artistic director.

The Michigan Daily: What 
makes Hubbard Street Dance 
Chicago unlike other dance 

companies?
GE: 
The 
dancers 
are 
incredible. 
They 
bring 
a 
beautiful sense of movement 
quality and technical ability, 
mixed with great imagination 
and 
thought-provoking 
intention. 
We 
also 
give 
opportunities 
to 
emerging 
choreographers, 
and 
this, 
mixed 
with 
our 
dancers, 
gives a great opportunity for 
choreographers 
to 
improve 
their imagination. But we’re 
not just a dance company: 
We have a huge education 
program. We also teach to 
autistic children and people 
with 
Parkinson’s. 
They’re 
dancers in their own right. 
These 
classes 
make 
our 
mission very satisfying; we feel 
like we’re making a difference 
in the dance world.
TMD: 
Given 
your 
prior 
background as a professional 
dancer with the Nederlands 
Dans Theater, what drew you 
to directing?
GE: As a dancer, I was 
always aware of my directors

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

COURTESY OF TOD ROSENBERG

DAILY COMEDY COLUMN

Sense of humor is a funny 
thing. What makes me giggle 
might not make you giggle, 
and vice-versa. But your sense 
of humor is more than your 
obsession with “The Office” or 
your weirdly erotic attraction 
to 
Conan 
O’Brien. 
Your 
sense of humor comes from a 
deeper, more personal place. 
It materializes when you first 
learn to laugh at yourself. I 
like to believe the emergence 
of one’s sense of humor as a 
parallel journey with puberty. 
When you become a man or 
woman is when your first sense 
of humor develops. But like 
your body, your sense of humor 
is always changing. What you 
found funny in middle school 
may or may not be funny to you 
anymore, but if booger and fart 
jokes still get you going, more 
power 
to 
you. 
Experiences 
and time change what we find 
funny. Maybe your humor has 
gotten darker with age or maybe 
you find solace from the world 
with mindless bathroom humor. 
The great thing about a sense 
of humor is that it’s yours, and 
with the ever-expanding sphere 
of 
comedic 
content, 
you’re 
bound to find your funny.
My sense of humor surfaced 
with my first period. I have 
three 
older 
brothers 
and 
growing up in a house of boys 
was an interesting experience, 
to say the least. They once told 
me that I was born a boy but the 
Rabbi accidentally chopped off 
my whole penis during the bris, 
so my parents just decided to 
tell me I was a girl. So for a very 
long time, I thought my genitals 
were the result of a botched 
circumcision. But they meant 
well; they’ve always been super 
protective. 
They 
constantly 
offered to beat people up for me. 
They never acted on it, but they 
always offered. Like if a boy 
picked on me: Want me to beat 
him up for you? Or some girl 
kicked me off the slide: Want me 
to beat her up for you? Or I got 
a bad grade on a test: Want me 
to beat him up for you? I mean 

they never could have actually 
beat anyone up, they’re three 
lanky, beta, Jewish boys whose 
athletic ability is limited to ping 
pong and “Legend of Zelda,” but 
it’s the thought that counts. I 
love my brothers. I just wanted 
to paint a picture, set the scene 
for my first encounter with 

womanhood. Anyway, my first 
period obviously occurred while 
I was sitting on the new, pristine 
white living room couch, the 
one my mom just bought. I was 
watching TV, probably “Drake 
& Josh,” with my brother, 
and when I got up from that 
goddamn living room couch I 
was greeted by a massive pool of 
blood shaped like a lotus where 
my ass had been and I swear I 
thought my kidneys fell out. My 
brother just gave me this look 
of surprised disgust, and all he 
said was, “let’s flip the cushion.” 
I swear to this day, that was 
the nicest thing a man has ever 
said to me. At that moment all 
we could do was laugh, and 
we just looked at each other 
and cackled our hearts out. 
Well, I was mostly crying, but 
then I started to laugh. So, I 
think that’s when my sense of 
humor developed. To this day, 
that cushion has never been 
flipped. Just kidding! I told my 
mom a few minutes later, and 
she sent it to the cleaners, but 
there is still an ass-shaped stain 
that never fully came out. My 
brothers like to remind me of its 
presence every Thanksgiving 

and Rosh Hashanah. So that is 
an integral part of my sense of 
humor, the kind of situations 
that elicit tearful laughter or 
cackled cries.
But my sense of humor is 
also the content I have ingested 
over years and years of binge-
watching VCRs of Mel Brooks 
movies and “Seinfeld.” I was 
binge-watching before it was 
even a thing. I remember sitting 
way too close to the TV, my eyes 
probably burning from the rays 
of 
entertainment, 
watching 
“Young Frankenstein,” neighing 
with the horse every time 
someone 
uttered 
the 
name 
“Frau Blucher.” In that way, 
I guess my sense of humor is 
also like that of an old Jewish 
man, 
one 
who 
appreciates 
clever word play and good 
herring. Over fall break I got 
to see that formative film, 
“Young Frankenstein,” in the 
Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 
L.A. with Daily alum Emily Bice. 
Before the film screened, a video 
appeared of dear old Mel in his 
office, a plethora of E.G.O.T.s 
behind him. He wished he 
could be in the cemetery with 
us, alive of course. He told 
delightful stories of the film’s 
Marty Feldman (Igor) and his 
excellent 
peripheral 
vision. 
My heart swelled as I saw one 
of my comedic icons on the 
screen before me, as if he was 
talking to me and only me. I was 
hysterical, crying as if I’d seen 
the ghost of Johnny Ramone 
(fun fact: He is buried in the 
Hollywood Forever Cemetery, 
and his tombstone is very rock 
‘n’ roll). I wiped my tears aside 
in time to see Gene Wilder 
stab his own leg with a scalpel. 
Anyway, my point is that your 
sense of humor is personal and 
unique and pretty damn terrific. 
Therefore, dear reader, I wish 
you the best of luck in finding 
your funny, whether it be in this 
column (it better be), on a stand-
up stage or in a network sitcom. 
Regardless, your sense of humor 
is yours to discover, enjoy the 
process and keep laughing.

You can’t escape the clichés
B

y now, you’ve probably 
heard Jim Harbaugh’s 
quote from his Monday 
press 
conference.
The 
Michigan 
football 
coach was 
asked if 
he has 
given his 
players any 
directive 
on how to 
talk about 
the sixth-ranked Wolverines’ 
upcoming game with No. 24 
Michigan State.
“I think we could all use 
a break from the clichés 
that have been plowed so 
thoroughly on both sides,” 
Harbaugh said.
Harbaugh didn’t mention 
any in particular, but there are 
dozens to choose from.
One of those clichés has 
become Harbaugh’s record 
against his rivals, including a 
1-2 mark against the Spartans. 
Detractors of Harbaugh, 
including many Michigan 
State fans, love to talk about 
that. It has made the common 
response — pointing out how 
close Michigan’s two losses 
under Harbaugh were — just 
as cliché.
Wolverine fans, on the 
other hand, like to praise their 
team’s historical dominance in 
the rivalry — Michigan leads 
the all-time series, 69-36-5. 
Spartan faithful will then 
point out that their team is 8-2 
in the last 10 matchups. Those 
stats have been plowed pretty 
thoroughly.
That’s how this rivalry has 
always been. The back-and-
forth is part of it, especially 
between the fanbases.
Then there are the quotes 
that have added fuel to the 
fire over the years.
Back in 1978, then-Michigan 
State coach Darryl Rogers 

called the Wolverines and 
their fans “arrogant asses.” 
Perhaps that sentiment still 
lingers today? I’ll leave that up 
to the readers.
The most 
recent 
resurgence of 
these sound 
bites came in 
2007, when the 
Wolverines 
came back from 
a 10-point, 
fourth-quarter 
deficit to win 
in East Lansing 
during Michigan State coach 
Mark Dantonio’s first season.
After the game, Michigan 
running back Mike Hart had 
a quote that is constantly 
regurgitated.
“I was just laughing. I 

thought it was funny,” Hart 
said. “(The Spartans) got 
excited, it’s good. Sometimes 
you get your little brother 
excited when 
you’re playing 
basketball and 
let him get the 
lead. Then you 
just come back 
and take it 
back.”
Since then, 
“little brother” 
chants are 
frequent when 
the Wolverines 
beat the Spartans — in 
football or basketball. On 
the flip side, Michigan State 
running back L.J. Scott called 
Michigan “our little sister,” 
this summer. That idea came 
from chants the Spartans have 

used over the past few years. I 
guess it’s supposed to be more 
demeaning.
But Hart’s quote also 
spurred an 
inspired 
response from 
Dantonio.
“I find a lot of 
the things (the 
Wolverines) 
do amusing,” 
Dantonio said 
two days after 
the game. “They 
need to check 
themselves 
sometimes. Let’s just 
remember, pride comes before 
the fall. ... They want to mock 
us, I’m telling them, it’s not 
over. They want to print that 
crap all over their locker 
room, it’s not over and it’ll 

never be over here. It’s just 
starting. ... I’m very proud 
of our football team, and 
I’m very proud of the way 
our football 
team handled 
themselves 
after the game 
as well. You 
don’t have to 
disrespect 
people. If they 
want to make a 
mockery of it, so 
be it. Their time 
will come.”
In light of 
how things have gone recently, 
Dantonio was right. The 
Spartans won the next four 
games in the series, beginning 
the eight-out-of-10 run they 
have going presently.
But more than the results 

on the field, Dantonio was 
right in that this will never be 
over.
The line in the sand is 
drawn incredibly clearly 
between Michigan and 
Michigan State. I grew up in 
Michigan, and it is incredibly 
rare to find someone who 
roots for both teams. If you 
do, they either have children 
at both institutions or aren’t 
big sports fans.
I remember in elementary 
school, kids would chant 
“Michigan, State!” The young 
Michigan fans would put their 
thumbs up when they said 
“Michigan” and their thumbs 
down when they said “State.” 
The Spartan children would 
do the opposite. Maybe that’s 
just a quirky, small-town West 
Michigan thing, but the point 
is that the deep-seated fandom 
of either team is synonymous 
with a deep-seated disdain for 
the other.
Log on to social media this 
week, or any other for that 
matter, and you’ll see how true 
that is. Heck, both campuses 
have been vandalized in the 
last few days, and I sure 
haven’t seen any calls for 
kids to be prosecuted. That’s 
because it’s just how this 
rivalry goes, and it has been 
forever.
When Harbaugh called for 
a break from the clichés, he 
was likely talking specifically 
about his team, attempting 
to quiet the noise within 
his program and focus the 
Wolverines for the hard-
fought game ahead.
But this will never be over. 
There will always be another 
game next year. That means 
the clichés will never end, 
either. 
It’s all part of the fun.

Michigan makes statement in win over Wisconsin

Coming into Saturday’s game 
against No. 15 Wisconsin, there 
was one prevailing question: How 
far has the Michigan football team 
come since its week one loss to 
Notre Dame?
Well, there’s your answer. Loud 
and clear.
The 12-ranked Wolverines (6-1 
overall, 3-0 Big Ten) were largely 
dominant on both sides of the ball 
Saturday, pummeling their way to 
a 38-13 win.
“A lot of people have a lot of 
questions about who we are as a 
team, our offensive line, our run 
game, we don’t show up in big 
games,” said junior running back 
Karan Higdon. “I think we laid 
that to rest today.”
Behind a bruising offensive line, 
Michigan rushed for 320 yards, 81 
of which came on a quarterback 
keeper from junior Shea Patterson 
on the Wolverines’ second drive 
of the game. Higdon scored two 
plays later, grabbing a 7-0 lead with 
13:55 left in the second quarter.
Michigan’s trio of quarterbacks 
— 
Patterson, 
freshman 
Joe 
Milton and redshirt freshman 
Dylan 
McCaffery 
— 
totaled 
156 
rushing 
yards 
and 
two 
rushing touchdowns, exploiting 
linebackers 
they 
saw 
over-
pursuing. It was a strategy worked 
into the gameplan ahead of time.
“If 
the 
team 
is 
playing 
undisciplined, we’re going to use 
that to our advantage. The edges 
were squeezing in too hard on the 
inside zone,” said junior safety 
Josh Metellus. “So Shea felt like he 
had a chance to pull it, and he did. 
They kept being undisciplined, so 
Shea just kept taking advantage of 
that.”
It can be easy to forget, after the 
blowout that would later ensue, 
that the game was tied in the 
second quarter.
It took just four plays for 
Wisconsin (4-2, 2-1) to respond to 
Patterson’s electric run, answering 
with seeming ease. The Badgers 
ran three times with Taylor, then 
handed the ball to wide receiver 
A.J. Taylor on a reverse, who 
scored from 33 yards to even the 
game at seven. 
Jonathan Taylor — the nation’s 

leading 
per-game 
rusher 
at 
nearly 180 yards — was limited 
in 
repetitions 
moreso 
than 
effectiveness. He finished with 101 
yards (just 22 in the second half) 
on 17 carries, averaging 5.9 yards 
per carry, near his season average 
of 6.7.
For a moment, it looked like 
the Wolverines might just glide 
alongside Patterson and Higdon to 
a breezy win.
Early, they squandered many of 
those chances — hardly reflective 
in the final scoreline.
Redshirt 
sophomore 
kicker 
Quinn Nordin missed two field 
goals in the first half. Patterson 
took multiple ill-advised sacks that 
either took Michigan out of field 
goal range or killed the momentum 
of a drive. Michigan attempted 
a questionable gadget play with 
Milton in an ultimately scoreless 
drive. After an interception by 
junior safety in the middle of 
the second quarter, Michigan’s 
offense stalled. 
In doing so, the Wolverines let 
the Badgers hang around for a bit 
— heading to halftime only up 13-7 
— but they never trailed the game. 
Despite repeatedly knocking on 
the door, the Wolverines couldn’t 
quite bust the game open.

Until the second half, when that 
door came flying off.
Bailed out by two drive-saving 
penalties, including a roughing-
the-snapper 
call 
on 
a 
punt, 
Patterson 
scored 
on 
another 
quarterback keeper to open the 
half, this time from seven yards 
out. 
Michigan’s control on the game 
never waned form there. Playing 
from behind, Wisconsin’s offense 
struggled to move the ball in 
chunks. Badgers quarterback Alex 
Hornibrook looked skittish in the 
pocket all night, never establishing 
any sort of rhythm.
Hornibrook finished the day 
7-for-20 for 100 passing yards and 
with quite a few more bruises.
And on the flip side, Michigan’s 
offensive line displayed just how 
far it has come as a unit since Notre 
Dame on Sept. 1. The Wolverines 
were physically dominant for a 
large potion of the game, aiding 
an impressive performance; the 
Wisconsin run defense came into 
the game averaging 130 rushing 
yards per game. 
“Each player, you could point 
to that — (Jon) Runyan, (Ben) 
Bredeson, Cesar (Ruiz), Michael 
Onwenu, Juwann Bushell-Beatty 
— they’re all playing their best 

football,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “They’re playing really 
well together.”
Added Higdon: “There’s no 
further question that we’ve got the 
best offensive line in the country.” 
With 9:55 left in the game, 
Wisconsin clinging to the faintest 
hope of life, Lavert Hill put an 
exclamation point on a destructive 
win, snatching a Hornibrook 
pass attempt with one hand and 
running 21 yards for a touchdown. 
“Every game is a statement 
victory,” said junior linebacker 
Josh Uche. “It’s win or go home 
from here on out, until the 
end of the season — until the 
championship games.”
What was that statement made 
today?
“That Michigan is here, here 
to stay,” Metellus said. “From 
week one we fell short, but we 
bounced back, we can fight 
through adversity, this is a real 
team, a real program that’s going 
to keep aggressive throughout the 
season.”
From the rushing attack to 
Patterson to the defense and in 
between, the Wolverines stamped 
their convincing win — and 
asserted themselves firmly in the 
thick of the Big Ten title race.

To ‘M’, Saturday’s 
game means more

Jim Harbaugh took the podium 
Monday for the start of his fourth 
Michigan State week as coach of 
the Michigan football team.
His 
ties 
to 
this 
rivalry 
are 
obvious. 
He went 2-1 against the Spartans as 
a player, and the Wolverines’ one 
loss with Harbaugh as the starting 
quarterback came in 1984, when 
Harbaugh broke his arm diving for 
a loose ball in the third quarter.
Since he returned to Ann 
Arbor in 2015, Harbaugh has led 
Michigan to a 1-2 record versus 
Michigan State, including that 
fumbled punt in his first season.
This record is part of one of 
Harbaugh’s greatest criticisms as 
a coach — his 1-5 mark against the 
Spartans and Ohio State.
In 
summary, 
Harbaugh 
is 
extremely 
familiar 
with 
this 
rivalry, which likely helped shape 
his answer when he was asked if 
there is any extra emotion entering 
Saturday’s game in East Lansing.
“Yes,” Harbaugh said. “In-state 
rival, Big Ten opponent. It always 
has, is and always will be (extra 
emotional).”
The rest of Harbaugh’s team 
shares the feeling, and for good 
reason. Junior running back Tru 
Wilson grew up in Michigan. Like 
anybody else who shares that bond, 
Wilson has been privy to the roots 
of this game his whole life.
“It’s in-state,” Wilson said. 
“We’ve got a lot of guys on our team 
that are from the state and have 
been living this rivalry — going to 
the game, watching the game — 
they’ve lived it just as much as I 
have, and we’ll be ready for it.”
Lawrence Marshall has a unique 
perspective. He too played high 
school football in Michigan, and, as 
a fifth-year senior defensive tackle, 
has been a part of the actual game 
as long as anybody on the roster.
He has friends on the other team 
who, in light of the Spartans’ success 
under coach Mark Dantonio, have 
taken the opportunity to dig at 
Marshall and the Wolverines.
“I remember when I was getting 

recruited, that was the year they 
won the Rose Bowl, my friends 
texted me, like, smelling roses, 
things like that,” Marshall said. “So 
it’s a lot of tension.”
Donovan Peoples-Jones feels 
that bond to the rivalry as much 
as anybody. Five players from the 
sophomore wide receiver’s high 
school — Detroit Cass Technical — 
will be on the field Saturday.
To count the number of players 
Peoples-Jones 
played 
against 
would take a long time. To him, 
though, the motivation doesn’t 
come from growing up watching 
games or the relationships he has 
with those on the opposing sideline. 
“I remember losing to them last 
year,” Peoples-Jones said. “The 
vibes that that brought our team, 
you know, it just wasn’t good. I 
think that’s all the motivation that 
we need for this week.”
Nick 
Eubanks 
isn’t 
from 
Michigan, he’s from Florida. But it 
doesn’t take long to get integrated 
into the Michigan State game.
The redshirt sophomore tight 
end gave perhaps the most colorful 
response of anybody about the 
Spartans.
“We hate those guys just as 
much (as the fans do),” Eubanks 
said. “We’re gonna see what they’re 
all about on Saturday.”
All of this is to say that this game 
means different things to different 
people.
No matter how you cut it, 
though, Saturday’s matchup is 
more than just the sixth- and 
24th-ranked teams playing for 
conference position.
It’s an opportunity for the 
Wolverines to move a step closer 
to their postseason goals, yes. 
But it’s also an opportunity for 
Wilson, Marshall and Peoples-
Jones to grab bragging rights over 
their friends for the next year. It’s 
an opportunity for Harbaugh to 
silence critics and make the extra 
emotions of the game positive 
ones.
It’s a chance for players and 
coaches to establish themselves as 
legends in a rivalry that means so 
much to so many people.

Michigan looking to right the ship defensively

Go back one year, and much 
is the same now for the No. 
11 Michigan hockey team — 
especially on defense.
Last season, the Wolverines 
took time to adjust to Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson’s system, 
only reaching peak defensive 
form in a post-New Year’s day 
stretch that saw them allow 
2.72 goals per game. Before that 
though, the Wolverines were 
plagued by lackadaisical play 
off the puck and turnovers deep 
in either zone.
Through one game against 
Vermont and two exhibition 
games, this season’s initial 
impressions are much of the 
same — Michigan has given up 
at least four goals in each game, 
and has allowed scores on five 
of 10 opposing power plays. Be 
it the blue line playing too far 
up on offense or committing 
too many turnovers, opposing 
teams have been able to break 
away and score, seemingly just 
like last year.
“Our play without the puck 
(needs to improve),” Pearson 
said. “Not as much in zone 
but our transition game when 
we’re getting back into our 
zone, who we’re picking up 
our goaltending, we have to get 
better there.
“... Definitely a defensive 
game. I think if you look at all 
the aspects you can’t expect 
to give up as many goals as we 
have in these games and expect 
to win. So one area that we’re 
going to spend a lot of time this 
week is working on our play 
without the puck.”
Unlike last year, though, 
Michigan 
can’t 
rely 
on 
unfamiliarity as much of an 
excuse. Whether it’s the blue-
line pairings of sophomore 
Quinn 
Hughes 
and 
senior 
Joseph Cecconi, or senior Nick 
Boka and junior Griffin Luce, 
the Wolverines return not only 
experience but also resilience 

from last year’s defense. 
That’s not to say, though, that 
the start of this season is all 
the back line’s fault. In college 
hockey, the unexpected is the 
expected, 
and 
that’s especially 
true 
when 
many 
teams 
haven’t formally 
stepped on the 
ice for a game 
in six or seven 
months. Having 
to 
integrate 
a 
completely 
new front line 
rotation 
is 
no 
simple 
task, 
either. Neither is manufacturing 
teamwide chemistry.
“We’re still fluid,” Pearson 
said. “We’re still trying to 
work on it, get some chemistry 
together. You can see it when 
(sophomore 
forward 
Jack) 

Becker and the two Pastujovs are 
together, they’re really good. (I 
think sophomore forward Josh 
Norris) and (junior forward 
Will) Lockwood have some 
chemistry. 
Other than that, 
we’ve 
gotta 
find some more 
chemistry, and 
you can’t force 
that, that’s the 
hard part. It’s 
gotta occur ... 
we 
have 
too 
many 
good 
players.”
Just like last 
year, Michigan 
has a chance to turn around its 
defense, but can learn from last 
year and fix things up a little 
earlier. Almost all the pieces 
are there. Junior goalkeeper 
Hayden Lavigne hasn’t started 
strongly, but he too has a 

second chance at redemption. 
Even 
freshman 
goalkeeper 
Strauss Mann showed flashes 
by allowing just one goal in his 
first 40 minutes of action on the 
ice.
“You know, Hayden’s a good 
goaltender, he’s just fighting it 
a little bit right now, Pearson 
said.“Maybe 
the 
exhibition 
game he didn’t prepare for or 
whatnot, but he’ll bounce back. 
And you have to. We got off 
to a slow start last year, and it 
(ended) really good,”
Time 
will 
tell 
if 
the 
Wolverines can duplicate the 
same successful run that they 
conjured up last year. While 
the first three games on Yost’s 
ice have been a mixed bag, to 
say the least, Michigan may 
well find a groove. Whether it’s 
enough or not is all in the hands 
of the men on the defensive end 
of the ice.

Handball sparks ‘M’ 
for big win over Titans

Even before kickoff, the 
Michigan men’s soccer team 
looked bigger and faster than 
Detroit Mercy. The physical 
supremacy carried over into the 
match, where the Wolverines 
controlled the Titans for much 
of the 90 minutes, winning, 
5-0.
With the game tied at zero, 
Michigan (9-2-1 overall, 3-1-1 
Big Ten) was firmly in control, 
as it dominated possession with 
precision passing, while Detroit 
Mercy 
(1-11-2 
overall, 
0-5-1 
Horizon) 
had 
trouble linking 
up more than 
three passes at 
a time. Then the 
Wolverines took 
the lead in the 
38th minute, as 
senior defender 
Marcello Borges 
drew a penalty 
after his cross into the box was 
blocked by a Titan defender’s 
arm.
To break the tie, sophomore 
midfielder Marc Ybarra lined 
up the ensuing penalty, as light 
rain came down on the players. 
With calm nerves, Ybarra sank 
the penalty kick into the right 
corner. The Titan keeper dove 
the wrong way and never had a 
chance at the save.
Up 1-0, the Wolverines never 
looked back, as they sank four 
more goals in the remaining 50 
minutes.
“I think we got ourselves 
in good advanced positions 
and then we got in advanced 
positions in the wide areas as 
well,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “I think the 
service caused them problems 
and we didn’t go to it enough 
and we finally got to go to it late 
in the half and when we did: 

handball, PK.”
Michigan 
played 
a 
very 
physical game after the penalty, 
as the Titans began to man-
mark after that. That opened 
up holes in the Detroit Mercy 
defense as the Wolverines’ 
passing pulled the Titans out of 
position and opened holes for 
Michigan to attack and advance 
its postion. 
The second goal quickly 
followed the first after a cross 
into the box fell to freshman 
forward 
Sosa 
Emovon. 
He 
slotted a pass to sophmore 
forward 
Umar 
Farouk Osman, 
who 
was 
waiting 
right 
outside 
the 
five-yard 
box 
in between two 
Detroit 
Mercy 
defenders. 
Osman rocketed 
the 
ball 
into 
the left corner 
giving 
the 
keeper no time to react.
The second half brought 
three more goals, and two 
more goalies for the Titans. 
After a breakaway goal by 
senior forward Noah Kleedtke 
and a corner kick headed in 
by 
sophomore 
defensemen 
Jackson Ragen, junior forward 
Jack Hallahan scored to go 
along with his two assists, 
calmly 
dribbling 
around 
Detroit Mercy‘s third goalie of 
the night and chipping the ball 
into the net.
With five games remaining 
before the Big Ten Tournament, 
it is key for the Wolverines to 
get these confidence-boosting 
wins.
“We’re 
only 
guaranteed 
ten hours, I told those guys 
today,” Daley said. “We’re only 
guaranteed ten hours of soccer, 
so let‘s make the most of it and 
I think they did tonight.” 

MEN’S SOCCER

For the Daily 

“We’re only 
guaranteed ten 
hours, I told 
those guys...”

Wolverines fall to Irish

Seconds before kickoff, senior 
Robbie Mertz made the sign of 
the cross and appeared to lift his 
hands in prayer. Given how the 
first half of the Michigan men’s 
soccer team’s matchup against 
Notre Dame went, there may 
very well have been something 
supernatural going on. It seems 
that the laws of physics were 
reversed; players spent more 
time on the ground than the ball, 
which was constantly airborne 
and passed backward instead of 
forward.
In the end, the Wolverines 
fell to the Fighting Irish (8-4-1) 
Tuesday night, almost a week 
after their 5-0 shutout win against 
Detroit Mercy increased their 
record to 9-3-1 overall and 3-1-1 in 
the Big Ten.
The game seemed to progress 
in slow motion, the first minutes 
spent in a punting match between 
the goalies, each launching the 
ball down the field right to the 
other. The game was also routinely 
interrupted by an abundance of 
fouls on both sides, each seemingly 
in response to the other team’s 
transgression. 
The 
back 
and 
forth quickly resulted in senior 
midfielder and captain Ivo Cerda’s 
early exit from the game after he 
suffered an injury. Soon after their 
captain came out, the Wolverines 
ceded a goal to Notre Dame’s 
Thomas Ueland off a rebound from 
Michigan sophomore defenseman 
Jackson Ragen.
Evidently with a chip on his 
shoulder, Ragen drew a yellow 
card late in the first half for 
slide tackling Notre Dame’s Ian 
Aschieris. Though the fouls kept 
raining down, the Wolverines 
seemed to wake up from their 
trance after falling behind, getting 
down to business.
“They passed well, they played 
well; we caused them a whole host 
of problems,” Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley said, and despite the 
loss, “... We outplayed Notre Dame 
from start to finish.”
Daley 
expressed 
disappointment in the referees, 
who had their whistles blowing all 
game with a combined total of 25 

fouls, 14 on Notre Dame and 11 on 
Michigan.
“Consistency is important in 
everything you do, because that’s 
what the players will expect, 
and that’s what the coaches will 
expect,” Daley said. “If the game 
is inconsistent, it disrupts your 
rhythm and flow; you don’t what’s 
a foul and what isn’t a foul.”
The Fighting Irish nearly scored 
a second time in the first half on a 
seemingly-undefended goal, but 
a last-minute charge call spared 
the 
Wolverines. 
That 
divine 
intervention not going unnoticed, 
Jack Hallahan capitalized in the 
form of an early second-half, 
right-foot goal in the bottom right 
corner of the net, tying the game 
and highlighting why he is ranked 
among the program’s top scorers 
historically.
Not to be outdone, Notre 
Dame’s Sean MacLeod answered 
Hallahan’s goal with one of his 
own, scoring off a penalty kick 
at 67:41 in the game. With three 
minutes left in the game, the 
Fighting Irish appeared to be 
playing a game of cat-and-mouse, 
taking their time to run down 
the clock and secure the victory. 
Michigan apparently didn’t know 
who was the cat and who was the 
mouse, as the claws came out and 
heated exchanges ensued.
As the regular season draws 
to a close, and with the Big Ten 
Tournament 
on 
the 
horizon, 
pressure is mounting going into 
Friday’s game against Wisconsin, 
which is vying to challenge the 
Wolverines’ No. 3 position in the 
conference.
The 
Badgers 
boast 
road 
wins 
against 
Maryland 
and 
Michigan State, both of which the 
Wolverines have to play before 
they end their regular season. 
Michigan needs to keep its footing, 
given that the Spartans, whom the 
Wolverines play next Tuesday, 
sits comfortably in second place. 
A bitter and close, 1-0 loss to No. 1 
Indiana on October 7 emphasized 
the stakes going into the the Big 
Ten Tournament.
“I think after (Tuesday’s loss) 
our guys will be hungry and 
motivated to get this out of our 
system,” Daley said. “The guys had 
a good day at the office.”

Beilein settling for freshmen in final rotation

At 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
first 
media 
availability of the season, John 
Beilein told reporters that his team 
needed “two or three” freshmen 
to work their way into a rotation 
depleted by graduation and NBA 
departures. 
Forwards 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis and Brandon Johns 
came in as highly-touted four-
star recruits, widely expected 
to contribute immediately, but 
Beilein would only commit to 
Brazdeikis.
“We’ve only got seven guys 
returning, we’re gonna have a nine 
or ten man rotation,” Beilein said 
at the time. “Two or three of those 
guys gotta find their way into that 
lineup.”
Three weeks later, he has 
settled on guard David DeJulius 
to join Brazdeikis and Johns in the 
rotation.
The reasons they — and not 
guard Adrien Nunez or center 
Colin Castleton — have earned 
Beilein’s trust are strength and 

defense, which he labels as the two 
factors that keep most freshmen 
off the court.
Through 
three 
weeks 
of 
practice, 
defense 
has 
been 
the biggest bright spot for the 
Wolverines. It’s why their practices 
are absent of players running stairs 
at the top of the Crisler Center or 
doing extra sprints afterwards.
In contrast to early last season, 
when 
then-freshman 
guard 
Jordan Poole’s defensive struggles 
kept him off the floor, this year’s 
freshmen have been at the center 
of Michigan’s defensive emphasis.
“They have a will to get better 
… it comes little bit by little bit 
with every kid,” Beilein said. 
“And some positions are harder. 
Colin Castleton’s man is gonna set 
screens, he doesn’t have to worry 
about zoning up as much. David’s 
got everything, Brandon’s trying to 
play two positions (power forward 
and center).”
“… Here’s the one thing they 
know more than anything else: If 
you don’t play defense, you’re not 
gonna play.”
Brazdeikis, 
DeJulius, 
and 

Johns’ physical readiness has also 
separated them from Nunez and 
Castleton.
Castleton has added 16 pounds 
since reporting to Ann Arbor at 
210 but still hasn’t fully grown 
into his 6-foot-10 body. In contrast, 
the Wolverines’ strength staff has 
already forced Brazdeikis to stop 
bench pressing because he’s too 
muscular.
“Their bodies are more ready 
than the other two right now,” 
Beilein said. “… Iggy is older than 
(sophomore) Jordan Poole so his 
body is ready. Brandon’s body is — 
he’s got a great body but he’s got to 
get stronger within that body. And 
then David is just like a bulldog, 
he’s got a great trunk to him, he’s 
got a great core to him. So those 
guys are gonna be ready.”
After losing production from 
last season at all five spots on 
the floor, Johns and Brazdeikis’ 
versatility adds to their value off 
the bench.
Beilein discussed Brazdeikis’ 
ability to play at the ‘2’ through ‘4’ 
last month, while he expects Johns 
to get time at power forward and 

center behind sophomore Isaiah 
Livers and junior Jon Teske, 
respectively.
“Brandon’s gonna have to learn 
the ‘4’ and ‘5,’ alright,” Beilein said. 
“Breaking news, he’s gonna have 
to learn those two positions.
“… For Brandon to sit there and 
watch Isaiah and Iggy play at the 
‘4’ wouldn’t make sense.”
That seemingly leaves Nunez 
and Castleton out of Beilein’s plans 
early in the season. But when 
asked about the possibility of 
either redshirting, Beilein would 
only say that he had informed all 
freshmen that they will lose their 
redshirt eligibility as soon as they 
enter a game.
That 
could 
be 
important 
information 
for 
Nunez 
and 
Castleton. For the other three, it 
will likely become irrelevant on 
opening night.
“They’re really hard working, 
and they’re really good kids,” 
Beilein said. “They are growing 
every day, and some days there are 
giant leaps and some days there 
are steps backwards. But I love 
coaching them.”

I

t was hard to walk into 
Schembechler Hall on 
Monday 
afternoon 
without 
becoming 
suffocated 
by the 
hoards 
of media 
members 
and 
television 
cameras 
lining the room. This week, the 
vibe was noticeably different.
Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh walked in and took 
the podium. His answers 
were terse. His tone was 
monotonous. There were 
no injury updates ahead of 
Michigan State. There was no 
discussion of the gameplan, 
retrospectively nor predictive. 
Sophomore fullback Ben 
Mason may or may not be 
injured. Junior defensive 
lineman Rashan Gary may or 
may not play. 
Welcome to rivalry week, in 
all its absurdity.
“I think we could all use 
a break from the cliches 
that have been plowed so 
thoroughly on both sides,” 
Harbaugh says.
Certainly that includes 
last year’s 
demoralizing 
upset loss to 
the Spartans 
in the pouring 
rain. No doubt 
he’d like to 
avoid discussing 
his 1-5 record 
against 
Michigan 
State and 
Ohio State — a 
figure firmly stamped into 
this program’s present ethos. 
No need for a reminder that 
Michigan hasn’t beaten a 
ranked opponent on the road 
since 2006. Perhaps those 
“cliches” include Mike Hart’s 

infamous “little brother” 
comment 10 years ago. There’s 
no point in harping on the fact 
that the Wolverines are 2-7 in 
this matchup since that quip. 
No one’s 
getting a break 
from those 
“cliches.” Not 
before Saturday 
at noon. And 
probably not 
after.
This is 
a big game 
pragmatically; 
No. 6 Michigan, 
coming off a 
blistering 38-13 win over then-
No. 15 Wisconsin, needs to 
keep the foot on the gas pedal. 
A loss Saturday would derail 
the wind suddenly at the sails 
of this program, not to mention 
hope of a College Football 

Playoff appearance.
This is a big game 
rhetorically; the program is 
at a tipping point this season 
under Harbaugh. A win in East 
Lansing would 
do wonders for 
the narrative 
around the state 
of the program.
This is a big 
game. Period.
“Yes,” 
Harbaugh said, 
when asked 
if there’s any 
heightened 
emotion this 
week. “In-state rival. Big Ten 
opponent. It always has (been 
a big game), always is, always 
will be.”
As Harbaugh departed into 
meetings, media members 
rushed to greet the players 

made available. There, perched 
ever-so-slightly above the 
blockade of people, stood 
fifth-year senior Lawrence 
Marshall.
Reporters 
find dozens of 
different ways 
to ask the same 
thing. Marshall 
finds dozens of 
different ways 
to provide the 
same answer.
In what ways 
is this week any 
different for you 
heading into 
Michigan State? Or no?
“A lot of my friends went to 
Michigan State, so it’s a lot of 
tension there. But other than 
that, this is a big game for us.”
Is there some playful trash-
talking?

“Of course there is.”
A lot of players have said this 
game’s personal for them. Why 
is there that chatter?
“This is a rivalry game, so 
every rivalry 
game is going to 
be personal.”
Missing Paul 
Bunyan? 
“Yes. Of 
course.”
The reporters 
search for the 
soundbite. The 
player tip-toes 
around it as best 
he can. So on, 
and so forth.
The practice is far from 
surprising, of course. It’s 
even understandable. This 
type of visceral distaste — 
the kind that is so plainly 
evident between Michigan 

and Michigan State players, 
coaches and fans — is precisely 
what makes college football 
unique. The winner next 
Saturday will stake a serious 
claim for the Big Ten East 
division, sure. But it will also 
hold bragging rights for a year. 
There’s a reason this week 
feels different than any other. 
It is different.
I wander over to linebacker 
Josh Ross’s media scrum, 
hoping for something to 
fall into my lap beyond the 
boilerplate back-and-forth I’ve 
grown frustrated by. 
That hope dissipates quickly. 
How much does this game 
mean to you?
“This rival is a big deal to me 
and I’m ready to go.”
It’s friendly here. Are you 
feeling any different? Emotions, 
excitement, how are you feeling?
“I feel like it’s natural, going 
into a game like this, to be super 
excited.”
Are you feeling any more 
excited going into this game?
“I wouldn’t say I’m more 
excited or anxious. I know how 
I feel about this game, and I 
know the passion I have for this 
game, and going into a game 
against an in-state rival, can’t 
beat it.”
I walk away, and look over 
at the group 
surrounding Tru 
Wilson. I walk 
leisurely toward 
that area. Just as 
I arrive, without 
an ounce of 
context on my 
end, a reporter 
asks Wilson a 
question.
Why did you 
get pet snakes if 
you’re scared of them?
Welcome to rivalry week. In 
all its absurdity.

EVAN AARON/Daily
Fifth-year senior defensive tackle Lawrence Marshall (#93) was asked about the importance of the Michigan State game at Monday’s media availability.

‘M’ notches two wins 

After the huddled Michigan 
field hockey offense broke apart, 
freshman forward Tina D’Anjolell 
jogged over to take the corner. The 
rest of the offense spread around 
the top of the arc — one player on 
the near side, three at the top and 
one on the far side. All throughout 
the game the Wolverines would 
pass the ball to the top of the circle 
on corners, but not this time.
D’Anjolell gave the ball to 
senior forward Emma Way at the 
near side, catching the Ball State 
defense off guard. Taking the open 
shot, Way slapped a shot low and 
hard to the far post, bouncing off 
the top of the goalkeeper’s foot and 
into the goal.
Way’s goal was the fifth of six 
in Michigan’s Sunday afternoon 
6-0 route over an outmatched 
Cardinals team. The resounding 
victory, 
coupled 
with 
Friday 
night’s 
conference 
win 
over 
rival Michigan State, brings the 
Wolverines’ record to 11-5 (6-1 Big 
Ten).
The match on Friday, though, 
didn’t come as easily as the win did 
Sunday. The struggling Spartans 
(4-12, 0-7) managed to hold 
Michigan to only one goal late in 
the second half — even when the 
Wolverines dominated the game 
— leading to a close 1-0 victory over 
Michigan State.
“I thought we played really well, 
just the Michigan State goalkeeper 
was phenomenal in that match, 
which kept them in the game,” said 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz. 
“But I thought our structure was 
good, our midfield play was good, I 
thought we had really outstanding 
shots on goal, and when you have a 
strong goalie sometimes that’s the 
way it goes.”
The Wolverines managed eight 
shots on goal compared to zero for 
the Spartans. Michigan also edged 
Michigan State in penalty corners 
by six to four.
Carrying their control over the 
game into Sunday, the Wolverines 
outclassed the visiting Ball State 
team in every way. Michigan had 
20 shots on goal, the Cardinals 
had one. The Wolverines had 14 
penalty corners, Ball State had one. 

The Cardinals had one moment in 
the 70-minute game where they 
flirted with the possibility of a goal, 
but it was quickly expelled by a 
capable Michigan defense. It was 
clear that the difference between 
the two games, though, was the 
Wolverine’s ability to finish. 
“It’s always a goal to finish and 
I think the last couple of games we 
had we had a couple of issues with 
it,” said freshman forward Maya 
Gompers. “That’s something we’ve 
been working a lot in practice on. 
Obviously we did a lot better with 
that today and we had a lot of 
shots off — which is another one of 
our goals — so I think we did that 
pretty well today.”
Gompers, an Ann Arbor native, 
got her first career goal Sunday off 
a rebound from a penalty corner — 
a theme for Michigan. Three of the 
Wolverines’ six goals came from 
penalty corners, and most of their 
chances did, too.
“This 
year 
we’re 
doing 
something different, we’re kind 
of calling the corners based on 
what we see with their defense 
coming out,” said senior forward 
Emma Way. “Today we had a lot 
of new players coming in, so kind 
of figuring out where each of them 
were to go was crucial today, but 
we just have a plethora of options — 
we just choose one and go with it.”
Way scored her 15th and 16th 
goal Sunday, too, even as Michigan 
played every single player available 
— giving players like Gompers 
the opportunity to score her first 
career goal. Opportunities like 
that don’t come very often, but 
when they do, there is always a 
celebration by everyone involved 
with the team.
“I think being able to get 
everybody into the game, get some 
experience,” said Pankratz. “It’s 
always good to get the younger 
kids some more game experience 
so they can get sharp and be able to 
help us into the tournament. That 
was the best part. It was a nice 
team win.”
And as the Wolverines look 
forward to their next challenge — a 
game against Ohio State — and even 
further toward the tournament 
season, games like Sunday’s will 
not come often, sweetening the 
memories.

Ambry Thomas feels ‘hate’ for Michigan State

The old adage about in-state 
rivalries says the implications 
of a loss extend far beyond a 
single game. Sometimes, the 
worst part of defeat is hearing 
about it until the next contest is 
played.
Ambry 
Thomas 
is 
quite 
familiar with that concept.
The sophomore corner was 
on the losing end of last year’s 
matchup between the Michigan 
football team and Michigan 
State. As an in-state product, 
Thomas was reminded of the 
upset with each visit back home. 
“Every time I go to Detroit,” 
Thomas said. “Every time. So 
often.”
Thomas knows “a lot” of 
Spartans from Martin Luther 
King High School, where he 
established his long-standing 
friendship with Michigan State 
linebacker Tyriq Thompson. 
That has made him especially 
eager for this Saturday’s battle 
between 
the 
sixth-ranked 
Wolverines and 24th-ranked 
Spartans. 
“This week, I’ve been getting 
a lot of messages,” Thomas 
said. 
“Tyriq 
Thompson, 
he 
sent me a video. 
I just liked it. 
(I) let him know 
we’re 
coming, 
though.
“It was just a 
recent exchange 
in a saga of trash 
talk between the 
two. 
Recently, 
Thomas 
found 
a picture of him stiff-arming 
Thompson and decided it would 
make for good wall decoration. 
When Thompson saw it, he 
reminded 
his 
friend, 
“I’m 
coming for you this year.”
While rivalry fuels their 
relationship now, the two were 
nearly 
college 
teammates. 
Thomas 
was 
recruited 
by 
Michigan State and admits that 
many thought he’d eventually 
take his talents to East Lansing. 

His friendships with current 
players 
like 
Thompson, 
in 
fact, made turning down the 
Spartans “tough.”
But now that Thomas is at 
Michigan — a decision he says 
he’s happy with — he doesn’t 
consider 
what 
could 
have 
been. 
Though 
he 
grew 
up 
without a strong 
allegiance 
to 
either 
side, 
Thomas 
has 
certainly 
developed 
feelings 
about 
the 
rivalry 
while 
playing 
for the Wolverines. 
“I don’t really think about 
that 
school 
(any) 
more,” 
Thomas said. “I just think about 
beating them.
“Right now, I’m feeling the 
hate in my heart. I just want 
to get after them. We got 
disrespected last year.”
Thomas figures to have a 
larger impact this time around, 
however. He saw his first snap at 
wide receiver against Western 

Michigan on Sept. 8, officially 
expanding 
his 
role 
beyond 
backup 
corner 
and 
kickoff 
returns — duties to which he 
was limited last season. 
It was an opportunity that 
Thomas had longed to receive.
“Right 
after 
Notre 
Dame 
game, 
(coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh) 
told me in the 
front of the team 
like, 
‘Ambry, 
how do you feel 
about 
playing 
offense?’” 
Thomas said. “I 
got real excited. 
I was like, ‘Yeah, 
put me in there.’ ”
Though his stats are limited 
— two catches for five yards 
and one catch for 11 — he has 
become a useful wrinkle in 
Harbaugh’s offense. As one 
of the team’s fastest players, 
Thomas is used frequently 
as 
a 
jet-sweep 
threat. 
Sometimes, 
he 
causes 
just 
enough hesitation in opposing 
defenses to open opportunities 
elsewhere.

Six games in, Thomas feels 
like offense is coming more 
naturally to him.
“Probably just seeing the 
game speed and all of that — 
I’m acclimated to it,” Thomas 
said. “Just getting the ball, I 
can really just 
play instead of 
doing what the 
coaches tell me 
like, ‘run here, 
run there.’ I’ve 
opened up my 
vision more.
“It’s 
a 
lot 
(playing 
all 
three sides of 
the ball), but 
I’m 
tough. 
I 
came here for the challenge. 
I’m just ready for work.”
That’s the kind of confidence 
Thomas carries into Saturday’s 
matchup. He has experienced 
the disappointment of losing 
to Michigan State — and the 
year of grief that comes with it. 
Now, Thomas is trying to make 
sure that doesn’t happen again.
“It’s just a high-emotional 
game for me,” Thomas said. 
“And I’m ready.”

F

or a population that 
bears the seemingly 
perpetual 
stress 
of 

finding a place to live near 
campus, it is curious how college 
students have such wanderlust 
for the world beyond. The 
evidence is glaring: World map 
tapestries draped across dorm 
room walls, screens of people 
lustfully googling flights during 
lectures and laptop stickers 
with cliché adventure quotes. 

This ubiquitous focus on 

the next destination translates 
to my own tendency to view 
college as a four-year excursion 
rather than a home address – the 
feeling of being a tourist rather 
than a permanent resident.

When I say tourist, I am not 

trying to allude to the postcard 
definition of a vacation with 
palm trees and no reason for 
an alarm clock. But rather, the 
transient nature of the college 
experience that manifests a 
lack of permanence.

Of course, there are certainly 

instances during which college 
produces an intense sentiment 
of 
belonging. 
One 
could 

argue football games provide 
this 
feeling 
of 
inclusion, 

motivating even those who 
don’t understand the sport. 
For me, whenever I witness 
college tours traversing the 
Diag or squeaking through 
the library I feel a rush of 
pride and connection to the 
institution. 
The 
entrance 

of wary high schoolers and 
eager parents into my purview 
embodies a physical distinction 
between tourist and resident. 
I find myself standing up a 
little straighter and relish my 
affiliation with the University 
of Michigan.

I 
have 
always 
been 

fascinated by the distinction 
between considering yourself 
a true resident of a place and a 
fleeting visitor. It is why when 
I am sitting at an airport gate 

eating Cheez-Its and thumbing 
through a magazine, I try to 
guess who is a tourist and who 
is a local of the destination 
typed across the gate screen. 
I quietly sit collecting the 
empirical evidence of accents, 
conversation 
snippets, 

appearances and personalities 
contributing to my conclusions 

of each traveler. My inferences 
of who is a tourist and who is 
a local are rarely confirmed, 
but that is not necessarily my 
ambition.

If 
anything, 
the 
most 

rewarding compliment while 
traveling 
is 
when 
people 

assume you are a local. Visiting 
a new place gives you a chance 
to shapeshift, to be a chameleon 
with the local crowd. At least 
for a few days, you can imagine 
yourself living somewhere else. 
Some destinations are easier 
to fake the criteria of being a 
resident than others.

For example, in order to bear 

the title of a true New Yorker, 
the lore of the Big Apple states 
you must have endured the 
city for a decade. Not only that, 
but the city conceals a list of 
unspoken rules far beyond what 
we learn from Buddy the elf. 
These criteria should have been 
enough to deter my desire to 
look like a New York local.

When visiting New York, 

you have two choices. You 
can embrace the persona of 

Times Square tourist — walk 
in the middle of a sidewalk, 
take a selfie on the steps of the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art 
and wear the most comfortable 
shoes you own. Or you can 
attempt to apply your education 
of how to be New Yorker 
learned from a curriculum of 
“Sex and the City” and Nora 

Ephron movies.

On this particular trip, my 

friend and I opted for the latter. 
We wanted to be effortless, to 
blend into the gilded city. Our 

moms thought we were crazy.

After 
a 
Sunday 
morning 

diet of bagels, we meandered 
through Central Park, perhaps 
one of the few landmarks 
receiving the same respect from 
both New Yorkers and tourists 
alike. We had no idea where we 
were going, but we tried to act 
like we did.

An adorable family that could 

rival Prince William and Kate 
Middleton’s brood approached 
us asking if we knew where the 
carousel was. Confession: We 
had absolutely no idea where 
the carousel was. But this was 
our chance for just one person 
to believe we were New Yorkers.

That we belonged.
So, we played the part of two 

girls who looked like we knew 
how to navigate Central Park 
and responded with a general 
wave in the direction behind us. 
Looking back, this was not the 
most tactful decision. I honestly 
still feel guilty about it. Our 
own ego of an image blinded the 
more honest answer. We were 

responsible for leading this 
idyllic Sunday morning family 
in a direction we certainly 
could not guarantee was the 
location of the carousel. 

The 
moment 
the 
family 

continued 
onward, 
mewy 

friend and I ditched our New 
Yorker status aspirations. The 
image with which I had become 
obsessed suddenly now seemed 
utterly 
ridiculous. 
Karma 

surfaced as we spent the rest 
of the afternoon hobbling with 
blistered heels as we regretted 
not choosing a more practical 
footwear option. 

The transience of college 

can easily aggregate a desire 
to find a home or sense of 
belonging beyond Ann Arbor. 
The 
wanderlust 
constructed 

from caricatures of jet setters 
and adventurers often lead us 
to want to assume a different 
lifestyle, even if it is just for a few 
days. Yet, the social dynamics 
of these images can often leave 
you feeling inauthentic — with a 
side effect of bad blisters.

T

alking is scary.

If you get called on in class 

out of the blue, there is no 

time for the gray fog in your brain to 
clear. There is no time to piece together 
an intellectual answer that accurately 
reflects what you actually think about 
the topic. Instead, you blurt out some 
half-concocted answer to try and pass 
yourself off as engaged student who is 
able to quickly formulate and articulate 
ideas.

In 
Advanced 
Placement 
English 

Literature class during my senior year 
of high school, we were in the middle of 
discussing “Beowulf” when my teacher 
decided to have everyone go around and 
say their greatest fear. As he started 
in the opposite corner of the room, 
my mind started racing. What’s my 
biggest fear? Spiders? That’s too basic. 
Abandonment? That’s too deep. Yet, 
even though my mind was racing, it was 
simultaneously blank.

Finally, it was my turn — the last 

person to reveal their biggest fear. I 
opened my mouth. And nothing came 
out.

One of my classmates joked, “Her 

biggest 
fear 
is 
public 
speaking, 

obviously.” And then we just moved on. 
I never answered my biggest fear. But 
my classmate was probably not too far 
off from the truth. 

If my teacher had assigned that 

prompt as a writing assignment, I 
could’ve written a brilliantly-worded 
paper using metaphors, imagery and 
symbols. Instead, he sprung it on us in 
class as a casual conversation topic and 
my mind froze. 

Talking is scary. No amount of 

preparation can appease that.

No matter how many times you 

practice a speech, it only takes one 
misbreath or misplaced swallow for you 
to start tripping over your tongue and 
random sounds to start tumbling out 
of your mouth that you think are words 

but are actually nonsensical gibberish 
which makes you wish you never started 
talking in the first place and you have to 
just remind yourself to breathe.
I

n U.S. History class during my 
sophomore year, our very first 
group presentation was about 

the American colonies. I was assigned 
Plymouth colony. My two groupmates 
and I stood at the front of the room, 
with over 40 eyes on us.

“The Mayflower Pilgrims landed in 

Plymouth, Massachusetts,” I started. 
“They befriended the American Indians 
in the area and were able to get food 
thanks to their native allies, Samoset 
and Sasquatch.”

I froze. I replayed what I just said in 

my head.

“Wait,” I said. “That’s not right…”
People were chuckling, my teacher 

included. “Did you say Sasquatch?”

“Um ... uhh … SQUANTO! I meant 

Squanto.”

But by then, the damage was done. 

Four years later, and I can still hear 
myself claiming Bigfoot helped the 
Pilgrims survive.

Fast forward a year: junior year, A.P. 

U.S. History. Another presentation — 
this time about Claudette Colvin.

“Everyone remembers Rosa Parks, 

but there was a girl before her named 
Claudette Colvin who refused to give up 
her seat on the bus nine months before 
Rosa Parks,” I rambled. “But the reason 
everyone knows Rosa Parks and nobody 
knows Claudette Colvin is because the 
NCAA thought Rosa Parks would make 
a better icon.”

During this presentation, I didn’t 

even catch my verbal blunder the first 
time around. I kept going, even though 
my mind was trying to stomp on the 
mental breaks because it could sense 
something wasn’t right.

“So the historical narrative favors 

Rosa Parks because the NCAA…”

Finally my brain processed what I 

said. But the letters were still scrambled 
in my head.

“Um … wait … N ... double A C P,” the 

letters slowly fell out of my mouth in the 
right order.

“Yeah ... ” my U.S. history teacher 

said. “I don’t think the professional 
basketball association endorsed Rosa 
Parks.”

Though he didn’t say it, I knew he 

was just thinking, “So silly.”

Talking is scary. Those speech gaffes 

happen instantly. It doesn’t matter if 
you’re asked a question and caught off-
guard or if you’ve practiced the words 
for months. Your mouth slips up, and 
it’s a moment frozen in time that you 
cannot go back to edit or erase.

That 
is 
why 
fact-checking 
and 

copyediting matters.

You can refine and revise on paper 

until you get it right. Live speaking is 
a one-shot deal. Writing gives you the 
time to think before you share your 
thoughts. It also allows for the ability 
to go back and make sure you’re saying 
what you want to say. Being a copy 

editor means I can find those mistakes 
and ensure the author’s message is 
accurately and adequately expressed.

That’s not to say writing is an 

infallible method of communication. 
It’s easy to type “our” instead of “out” or 
use the wrong there, their or they’re or 
confuse your acronyms of similar letters 
and type “NCAA” instead of “NAACP,” 
especially if you’re a basketball fan or 
a passionate activist and the muscle 
memory of your fingers kicks in.

However, 
just 
as 
speaking 
is 

dreadfully instantaneous and fleeting, 
writing 
is 
hauntingly 
permanent. 

One typo can go down in history. For 
example, the infamous covfefe becomes 
an embodiment of our nation’s leader. 
But with typing competency, sharp eyes 
and the will to proofread, errors are 
avoidable if one puts in the time and 
thought.

So whether it is impromptu speaking 

or a prepared speech, talking is scary. 
I guess that’s why I’ll stick to being a 
newspaper copy editor and not a TV 
reporter.

Copy That: The fear of speaking and the 
horror of writing

It doesn’t matter if you’re asked a question 
and caught off-guard or if you’ve practiced

This is part two of a series published by the 

Statement examining the Canterbury House, its 
influences and history. Part one was published 
last week, titled “You Can’t Bury Canterbury: 
Ann Arbor’s Hidden Musical Gem.”
A 

simple bass line plucked on an 
upright bass lays beneath the voice 
of a strong soprano. The voice sings:

“Maybe we could use this as communion.
Stand and hold hands.”
[Chairs shuffling and sliding]
“We shall overcome
We shall overcome
We shall-”
[Audience members join in]
“overcome someday
Deep in my heart …”
The recording sample, just as the whole 

audience starts to sing, fades out. If the civil 
rights and anti-Vietnam movement can be 
exemplified in one song, “We Shall Overcome” 
is it. Originally a gospel song and covered 
countless times by artists like Pete Seeger, 
Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and everyone under the 
sun, this rendition comes from the powerful 
and captivating voice of Odetta, recorded in 
1967 at Canterbury House and found among 
the other recordings digitized by the Michi-
gan History Project and Project President 
Alan Glenn.

In addition to the concerts staged at the 

coffee shop location in the ‘60s, Canterbury 
House became a hub for political activism and 
people who wanted to express their disdain 
for the United States’s involvement in Viet-
nam. According to Canterbury House records, 
former Chaplain Dan Burke perceived Can-
terbury House as an instrumental institution 
in Ann Arbor’s history of activism.

“I think it was unanimous that we were 

opposed to the war,” Burke said. “We were 

involved in anti-war protests and in some 
–– but not all –– of the counterculture. Lots 
of organizing events occurred in the building 
just because it was a place everybody knew 
and trusted.”

However, as “We Shall Overcome” should 

make obvious, former Canterbury House 
doorkeeper and performer Bob Franke said 
the music and the politics weren’t mutually 
exclusive, but rather intertwined in a very 
purposeful way. According to Franke, folk 
music is inherently political, as its storytelling 
nature and ability to be sung in congregation 
makes it a powerful force against injustice 
and the evils of the world.

“The idea of music being good for a num-

ber of political purposes and being a power-
ful way of basically expressing … political 
solidarity, that was all up front and that was 
a part of what was happening,” Franke said. 
“The Civil Rights era definitely fed into it and 
was a part of it. There was a real sense that we 
were writing about politics as well as music.”

In terms of political participation, a lot of 

the regular patrons, like Canterbury photog-
rapher Al Blixt and Franke, were involved 
with the cause simply by hanging around and 
discussing how to further “the Movement,” as 
Gayle Rubin, an associate professor of anthro-
pology and women’s studies at the University 
of Michigan, explained.

“It was obviously a highly charged political 

era, so there was this counterculture vibe like 
Woodstock all day,” Blixt said. “What we felt 
was we had an unpopular war going on and a 
lot of us were suffused with the idea of put-
ting an end to that.”

“I was not a political organizer per se but, 

like many young people, it was clear to me 

what was right, and so I hung out and I sup-
ported what I could,” Franke said. “As much 
as I look back on those days with compas-
sion for everyone involved, I learned from my 
father’s experience that war was essentially a 
crock and went at it from that angle.”

The coffee shop location dabbled in all ele-

ments of counterculture amid the political 
turbulence of the ’60s, according to Glenn’s 

research of Canterbury.

“Canterbury was deeply involved with all 

aspects of the ’60s movement,” Glenn wrote 
in an email interview. “Social justice, racial 
equality, political revolution, anti-war pro-
test, draft resistance, you name it. Plus the 
explosion of creativity that took place in the 
arts and sciences. It was a truly happening 
place made possible through the hard work 
and sincere commitment of a lot of groovy 
people, the likes of which we unfortunately 
won’t see again for a long time.”

Glenn’s sentiments echoed the political cli-

mate of the University community as well. On 
campus, only a few blocks from Canterbury 
House, students were organizing protests and 
teach-ins against the Vietnam War and other 
political causes.

After the ’60s had come and gone and Burke 

and Martin Bell had moved ministries, Can-
terbury House decided to take a step back 
from the concerts and counterculture. In 
1971, it moved back to the house on North 
Division Street that it occupied first in 1935 
and concentrated on the ministry, a return to 
its roots. However, its involvement in social 
equality didn’t come to a complete stop. How 
could it, with such a rich history of activism 
under its belt?

On Sept. 28, 1975, the Canterbury House 

Gayness and Spirituality Group, an organi-
zation “for people of any spiritual path who 
relate positively to their own gayness,” met 
for the first time. The group was instrumental 
in making gay students at the University feel 
accepted by a religious institution in a time 
when homosexuality was persecuted by soci-
ety and the law.

By providing a safe haven for people of all 

creeds to discuss their sexual orientation 
and spirituality, as well as an opportunity to 
meet other gay students on campus at events 
like the “Gay Dance Party” and other weekly 

meetings, Canterbury House led the charge in 
combatting stigmas against homosexuality in 
the ’70s.

After moving to a new space on South State 

Street in 1978 in hopes of reinvigorating the 
buzz around the ministry from the ’60s, Can-
terbury House rebranded as Canterbury Loft. 
Poetry readings, musical theater performanc-
es and concerts followed suit. However, the 
public profile of the venue had diminished 
from its heyday in the ’60s. Canterbury moved 
back to its home on Division in 1984 and then 
relocated to its current home at 721 E. Huron 
in 1995.

And now, cue the jazz.
W

hen Matthew Lawrence took the 
job of Canterbury House chap-
lain in 1996, he had big plans for 

how to reinvigorate the church’s role in Ann 
Arbor’s music scene while also maintaining a 
spiritual mindset.

“Every generation must reinterpret the 

Gospel according to its own categories, but 
our current shift in paradigms reflects more 
than a generational transition,” Lawrence 
said, according to Canterbury House docu-
ments. “We are entering a new epoch of faith, 
and we are the shapers of the future. It is a 
time of experimentation and playfulness, 
imagination and openness; it is also a time of 
painful conflict and confusion as the current 
divisions in the Episcopal Church and our 
society testify.”

For this mission, Lawrence called on Ste-

phen Rush, a current professor of perform-
ing arts technology in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance and the former music direc-
tor at the Canterbury House, to bring his 
music expertise to Canterbury House. At this 
moment, Jazz Mass was born.

“(Lawrence) asked me if I wanted to do 

music there, like jazz, and I probably used 
some expletives and I said, ‘Listen, I’ve got a

musical gem (Part 2)

band that plays Albert Ayler and John 

Coltrane and if that’s what you want, we can 
do that,’” Rush said. “I said, ‘I’m not willing 
to do it once a month. It needs to be every 
week because otherwise, you’re just messing 
around.’”

Every Sunday at 5:00 p.m., Canterbury 

House would fill with students and jazz 
fans alike to hear Rush and his band 
Quartex play newly arranged hymns and 
experimental jazz pieces. This blending of 
worship and music was both a callback to 
the folk services attended by Rubin and the 
like in the ’60s, but also a step further.

I don’t normally enjoy phone interviews. 

You can’t engage with your source the same 
way you can in person. Also, you always 
step on each other’s comments when trying 
to make it a conversation because you can’t 
see the other person slightly open their 
mouth when they want to say something.

Chatting with Rush feels like shooting 

the breeze with an old friend, even over the 
phone.

“What I always did was whatever read-

ing that was going to be used by the priest for 
that sermon that Sunday, I would find music 
from avant-garde jazz tradition that would 
fit that really, really well,” Rush said.

As someone who was not raised in a reli-

gious household and could count the num-
ber of times I’ve set foot in any church on 
my hands and toes, the music of the church 
was always the only thing that could get me 
inside the door. I can say I would have been 
at Jazz Mass every weekend.

In Rush’s eyes, Canterbury’s role on cam-

pus is an incubator for students to not only 
to examine faith and beliefs, but also explore 
their range as musicians –– just as Franke 
did in the ’60s –– and engage in social justice.

“Lots of groovy music that students are 

doing on their own, there’s just not really a 

place for them to do it, so they do it at Can-
terbury,” Rush said. “It’s a scene and scenes 
are really, really important historically and 
scenes are important socially, and out of 
scenes come activism.”

L

ining the walls of the Canterbury 
House foyer above the large bay 
windows facing North Quad Resi-

dence Hall are CD cases — Ornette Coleman, 
Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder and the like — 
interspersed with images of what appear to 
be saints like Mary Magdalene and Hilde-
gard of Bingen. But not all of them are reli-
gious figures. Martin Luther King Jr., Isaac 
Newton, Albert Einstein make appearances. 
No one else could have constructed this 
symbolic exhibition of the bonds between 
Episcopal sainthood and jazz iconography 
other than Rush.

Chaplain Matthew Lukens, in a green 

flannel with the typical black shirt and white 
collar underneath, confirms my suspicions. 
When I asked about his casual attire mixed 

with the collar, Lukens said he will probably 
wear the collar less as he gets older. For now, 
he wears it because, to him, it means the 
Episcopalian Church is “willing to invest in 
leadership with someone who’s young and 
queer.”

Lukens celebrates his one-year anni-

versary as chaplain at Canterbury in Octo-
ber. Prior to his accepting of the position, 
Lukens was hiking the Appalachian Trail 
and, before that, was working as Vicar of 
Emmanuel Church in the Diocese of Hawaii.

At Lukens’s feet rests Bear, the House’s 

pet dog, who is skittish at first but just wants 
you to chase him and play. Naturally, I have 
to oblige.

Next to Lukens is Music, Theatre & Dance 

senior Kenji Lee, the coordinator for Can-
terbury’s Concert Series. He also goes by 
“Music Guy” or “Dude of All Concerts.”

When Lukens first arrived in Ann Arbor, 

Lee gave him the rundown on what this 
space was and what it had the potential to be. 
Lukens said he had always wanted to work 
at a student ministry and when Lee outlined 

Canterbury’s four main pillars of opera-
tions — faith community events, food min-
istries, the concert space and social activism 
— Lukens quickly discovered Canterbury’s 
goals aligned with his own.

“The first time we met, you talked about 

Canterbury House as a ‘compassionate space 

for all people,’” Lukens said to Lee.

In Lukens’s eyes, Lee’s description 

lives up to its history. But Lukens quick-
ly discovered, after learning more about 
the institution’s legacy in Ann Arbor, 
that he could not have bigger shoes to 
fill.

During his first month at Michigan, 

Lukens attended a lecture on the Lav-
ender Scare, the moniker given to the 
persecution of LGBTQ individuals in 
the federal government during the Cold 
War. Upon talking to the lecturer and 
other faculty members who had attend-
ed the University in the ’60s, he got to 
know how important the building was 
and the duty he inherited.

“I said ‘My name’s Matthew, I’m the 

new chaplain at Canterbury House’ and with 
that, their entire expression changed on 
their faces and they lit up and said, ‘Canter-
bury House? When I was an undergrad here 
back in the ’60s, that was where all the activ-
ists hung out. I’m a secular Jew but I was at 
Canterbury House. It was great.’” Lukens 
said some recounted to him. “The history 
here is really well established … and I really 
take that as a mandate in my time here to fig-
ure out how can we best live up to that.”

However, Lukens knows reveling in the 

past and trying to restore the glory days of 
Canterbury won’t serve the community 
as well as allowing Canterbury to evolve 
with the present times. Lukens still encour-
ages any student groups, be they political 
in nature or not, to use the space and plan

“In Rush’s eyes, Canterbury’s role on 

campus is an incubator for students to 
not only to examine faith and beliefs, 
but also explore their range as musi-
cians –– just as Franke did in the ’60s 

–– and engage in social justice.”

events. He specifically mentioned some 
organizing of the movement to stop a pro-
posed visit last semester by white suprema-
cist Richard Spencer — referred to online 
as #StopSpencer — was done on the same 
couches on which we were sitting during our 
conversation.

“How can we best have this be a space 

where people who care about chang-
ing the world for the better know 
that they have a home here?” Lukens 
asked. “On the one hand, there are 
these big expectations that come 
from (the history) but, on the other 
hand, there’s also this allowance for 
whatever you come up with which 
might be completely wild and out of 
left field and that’s totally fine, let’s 
do it.”

Lee faced similar challenges when 

he became the concert coordina-
tor for Canterbury. Nowadays, Lee 
is constantly commuting between 
his final year of classes at the Music 
School, facilitating concerts at Can-
terbury and playing with various 
jazz combos in Detroit. According to 
Lee, the position is typically passed through 
the Jazz Department.

Before accepting the job, Lee was told by 

the previous coordinator he would make “X 
amount of money for six concerts a semes-
ter,” but was quickly informed “every con-
cert coordinator ever has put on at least 30 
concerts a semester.” Knowing he wasn’t 
going to get paid for the amount of work 
he put into the job, Lee still accepted the 
responsibility of cultivating the music scene 
at Canterbury.

When he stepped into his role, he hit the 

ground running, acknowledging the musical 
legacy of the coffee shop and, perhaps more 
fitting for Lee’s musical palette, Rush’s Jazz 

Mass. However, he said the pressure to live 
up to the past pushed him too far his first 
year out.

“My first year as concert coordinator, I 

booked way too many things, it was like four 
nights a week of music which is just crazy 
and I was freaking out because I couldn’t 
practice, I couldn’t study, I couldn’t do any-

thing and I was just here,” Lee said. “I slept 
on that couch so many nights … My second 
year … I wasn’t going to make those efforts 
anymore because I don’t need to do that but 
that resulted in (me seeing) the musical com-
munity shrink a bit … This year is my final 
year as concert coordinator and the year is 
just beginning but I feel like I’ve got it down.”

Like many who have come through 

Canterbury’s doors, Lee was not raised in 
an Episcopal household. With “an atheist 
Berkeley hippy father and … a Shinto Bud-
dhist (mother) from Japan,” Lee under-
stands the skepticism from touring bands 
who don’t know how, as Lukens described it, 
“fluid” a space like Canterbury can be.

“I’ll get emails and calls from people 

like, ‘OK we don’t know if we want to play a 
church’ or whatever,” Lee said. “Canterbury 
House is the first religious space that I’ve 
ever felt comfortable in … I think getting that 
question like, ‘What is Canterbury House,’” 
I still use (former Chaplain Reid Hamilton’s) 
answer all the time: It’s the home of left-

wingy causes.”

Lukens acknowledged this disconnect 

between social activism and religion that’s 
commonly expected to exist today. While 
Lukens said, “Christianity has such a repu-
tation … for not creating welcoming spaces,” 
Lee said Lukens’s being in the position of 
Chaplain as a gay man and the activism and 
music that has always inhabited the walls of 
Canterbury no matter where in Ann Arbor 
they resided should speak to the one-of-a-
kind magic of Canterbury House.

“It’s common knowledge that this place is 

on the right side of history,” Lee said.

A

fter taking out my earbuds and 
reveling in the recording samples 
of Mitchell, Odetta and the oth-

ers found by the Michigan History Project, I 
couldn’t help but think about those annoying 
YouTube comments made by middle school-
ers on Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix lyric 
videos.

“I was born in the wrong generation lol 

XD,” the children would whine.

I am not proud to say I was one of those 

middle schoolers. Now, it’s endearing to say 
you listened to classic rock and folk with 
your parents growing up. You already have 
the musical palate of an indie movie. Back 
then, you were obnoxious and pompous if 
you wanted to kick Ke$ha to the curb instead 
of Mick Jagger. One time, I almost blew a 
gasket because my friend said Bastille was 
better than The Doors. I refused to embrace 
any music from the past decade.

Much to Middle School Matt’s delight, 

these tapes give us a gateway into the musical 
incubator Ann Arbor was during this influ-
ential time in music history. But if I could tell 
Middle School Matt anything, it would be to 
get your head out of your ass and look around 
at the local creatives taking what was being 
made at Canterbury in the ’60s and building 
upon it. The same goes for political organiz-
ing. Innovation is the key to discovery. How 
would singers like Joni Mitchell, Neil Young 
and Dave Van Ronk have come to be if they 
hadn’t taken the Harry Smith Anthology of 
American Folk Music, learned what they 
could and move forward?

Canterbury House has been an institu-

tion in Ann Arbor for more than a century 
now. As long as people like Middle School 
Matt embrace what it has to offer, it should 
be around for another century and maybe 
more.
