Disagreement over impact 
of gerrymandering in MI

Voters see their voice 
as less effective, since 
the majority opinion 
isn’t fulfilled, may 

breed apathy 

By CARLY RYAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Eastern Michigan University 

junior Allen Maxson looked at a 
map of Michigan’s congressional 
districts and saw something “like 
a map of Europe in the middle 
of World War 2.” State Rep. 
Jeremy Moss (D–Southfield) saw 
“a squiggly mess.” And Wayne 
State Prof. Kevin Deegan-Krause 
saw a “creepy lizard” in what is 
better known as Michigan’s 14th 
congressional district, according to 
the Detroit Free Press.

Increasingly, fingers are being 

pointed at gerrymandering — the 
practice of manipulating voting 
districts to favor a certain party — 
to explain the state of Michigan’s 
election outcomes, which might 
seem incongruous with voting 

habits.

For 
example, 
in 
2014, 

Republicans won 9 of the 14 
congressional 
races, 
increasing 

their hold of the Michigan House 
of Representatives by 3 seats. But 
Republicans received fewer votes 
than the Democrats, who pulled 
ahead by 50,000. A similar scenario 
played out in 2016, contributing to 
the fact that though Michigan as 
a state votes “purple,” district by 
district, it’s really rather red.

On the other end of the 

spectrum, Detroiters were unable 
to vote out state Sen. Virgil Smith 
(D–Detroit), despite his felony 
charges for opening fire at his wife’s 
car and assaulting her, and state 
Rep. Gary Glenn (R-Midland) was 
reelected despite controversy over 
being a card-carrying member of 
an alleged hate group, leaving many 
voters wondering whether they 
are picking their politicians or if 
politicians are picking them.

Why Michigan?
Redistricting 
in 
Michigan 

is no simple process. The U.S. 
constitution requires that each 
district, both federal and state, have 

about the same size population. 
This is strictly enforced, as a 
congressional district map that 
has a 1 percent range from the 
smallest 
to 
largest 
population 

would be deemed unconstitutional. 
Additionally, districts must be 
drawn to ensure minorities not 
only have a vote, but they have 
an effective vote. Meaning, the 
amount of representatives who are 
favored by minority voters should 
be proportional to the amount 
of minority voters. The elected 
officials must reflect the voter 
base. States often create minority-
majority districts to ensure this 
— Michigan has two — and to 
prevent “cracking,” the splitting of a 
constituency so its majority is never 
voted into office.

With all of these redistricting 

restrictions, 
it 
seems 
unlikely 

that further manipulation could 
occur. Yet Moss said Michigan 
is in a position that would allow 
gerrymandering to occur. Rarely 
is there one party in control of 
an entire state, but Michigan’s 
governor, 
secretary 
of 
state,

Ira Glass discusses 
professional success, 
effective storytelling

By DYLAN LACROIX
Summer Daily News Editor

Headlining 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Summer Festival, hundreds of 
community members came to 
watch renowned U.S. storyteller 
Ira Glass perform at the University 
of Michigan’s Power Center for the 
Performing Arts Saturday night.

Weekly, Glass’s public radio 

show 
This 
American 
Life 
— 

which shares personal, thought-
provoking narrative stories of 
everyday lives — reaches over 2.2 
million audience members, with 
another 2.4 million downloading 
each episode.

His performance that night 

titled “Seven Things I’ve Learned” 
— which ironically began to reach 
a total of 10 throughout the show 
— shared his path to success as a 
journalist and the quintessential 
elements of telling a story he 
discovered through his experience 
on radio.

Glass 
began 
the 
show 
by 

discussing 
his 
technique 
for 

engaging audiences with stories, 
explaining how the presence of 
profound ideas and emotional 
depth are not what make a story 
worth telling; its momentum is. 

“In its simplest form, a story is 

just like a series of events,” Glass 
spoke. “Feelings might be in there 
or might not be in there. Ideas 
might be in there but might not be 
in there. There might be something 
you can relate to, but even that’s 
kind of optional.”

Ann Arbor residents call for Trump’s 
impeachment in local demonstration

Protesters denounced 
recent local action by 
immigration officials

By DYLAN LACROIX

Summer Daily News Editor

Hundreds 
of 
community 

members 
organized 
on 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
Diag 

Sunday 
afternoon 
to 
partake 

in 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
Impeachment 

March — one of many taking 
place across the country today — 
urging legislators to take action to 
impeach President Donald Trump.

The march, which began on 

the Diag around noon, made its 
way down East Liberty Street in 
downtown Ann Arbor and Main 
Street and halted at South Division 
Street and Liberty, where local 
anti-Trump leaders, activists and 
organizers convened to speak to 
the crowd.

Art & Design senior Keysha 

Wall, 
former 
presidential 

candidate for Central Student 
Government and one of many 
speakers of the event, addressed 
the activists before beginning the 
march. She outlined the beliefs and 

values for which the march stands, 
emphasizing 
Trump’s 
alleged 

violations of the U.S. Constitution 
and 
his 
actionsundermining 

human rights, as the energy for the 
movement.

In 
reference 
to 
a 
recent 

deportation raid effort of 114 Iraqi 
Christians in Detroit — which has 
been temporarily halted by U.S. 
District Judge Mark Goldsmith — 
Wall outlined how, as a movement, 
they must stand up for immigrants.

“It will never be enough to only 

be satisfied with the rhetoric in 
these,” Wall said. “We come today 
to explicitly denounce Trump’s 
attack on immigrant communities 
and undocumented peoples.”

Jessica Prozinski, co-founder 

and leader of Stop Trump Ann 
Arbor, a group that identifies itself 
as “a united progressive social 
movement” in resistance to the 
Trump 
Administration, 
spoke 

after the march stating if President 
Trump is not impeached, the 
existence of our political system is 
at stake.

“Our democracy may not survive 

four years of a Trump presidency,” 
Prozinski said. “We can’t rely on 
free and fair elections in four years 
to get rid of Trump.”

Pointing to recent investigations 

of foreign governments hacking into 
the U.S. election system, Prozinski 
stressed the urgency to take action 
with government officials.

“This is surely a way that a 

civilization 
can 
die,” 
Prozinski 

spoke. 
“It 
doesn’t 
start 
with 

concentration camps, but without 
brain and persistence and powerful 
resistance, make no mistake, that 
that is where it can end.” 

Rocio Sias, who organizes for 

human rights and has helped families 
in jeopardy of being deported for 
over five years, shared an emotional 
narrative of her experiences as an 
immigrant, fighting back agains 
derogatory claims President Trump 
has made in the past.

“I’m not a drug dealer, I’m not a 

rapist, I’m just a regular citizen,” 
Sias said. “I’m your neighbor, I love 
this country who’s given me so many 
opportunities.”

She went on to discuss how, 

throughout her work with families 
through 
the 
Human 
Rights 

Campaign 
and 
American 
Civil 

Liberties 
Union, 
she 
believes 

Trump’s 
increased 
deportation 

efforts are tearing the country and 
it’s people apart.

“I have witnessed so much 

destruction from this man,” Sias 
said. “This is not the country I 
came to live in. He’s made so much 

division, and its so sad and heart-
breaking, to see this all, because I 
know Americans are great people. 
He does not represent us, he does not 
represent you.”

Local high schooler Amery Chao, 

an organizer with Stop Trump 
Ann 
Arbor, 
spoke 
passionately 

about continuing to resist against 
the 
Trump 
Administration, 

emphasizing the importance to 
remain vigilant in fighting against 
the 
alleged 
“systems” 
Trump 

manifests.

“The 
danger 
in 
hinging 
a 

political movement on any single 
political figure is that it fosters 
the misconception that, once said 
political figure is gone, our work is 
done,” Chao spoke. “We are standing 
against 
everything 
he 
stands 

for, perpetuates and represents. 
We are standing up to racism, 
nazisim, xenophobia, Islamophobia, 
misogyny, queerphobia, transphobia, 
nationalism, capitalism.”

LSA 
freshman 
Sophia 

Tzavaras, 
who 
attended 
the 

Impeachment 
March, 
said 

though many of the concerns 
of the movement have no direct 
impact on her own life, she still 
feels obligated to support the 
movement.

University faculty member finds link between access 
to employer-provided health care and employee race, sex

Almost every health 
condition could be 
impacted by access 

to health care, 
researcher says

By KENNEDY WERNER

Daily Staff Reporter

New University of Michigan 

research find that employment 
leads to a higher life expectancy 
for white men. The study empha-
sizes 
that 
Black 
individuals, 

women and those from a lower 
educational background do not 
reap the benefits of employment 

to the same extent as their white, 
male counterparts do. 

The findings, published in the 

Journal of Racial and Ethnic 
Health Disparities, state employ-
ment allows the maximum health 
advantage for white males. Health 
advantage, measured by incidence 
of mortality, dropped 39 percent 
for Black employees (as compared 
to white employees), 30 percent 
for women (as compared to men), 
and 36 percent for those from a 
less educated background.

Shervin Assari, a research 

investigator for the University’s 
medical school and School of Pub-
lic Health, is a lead author of the 
study. He explained almost every 
health condition can be affect-
ed by an individual’s access to 
resources. If access to resources 

are limited, one’s health can suf-
fer and mortality can rise. 

Factors such as education level, 

economic background, race and 
gender are called social determi-
nants of health. They play a major 
role in access and, therefore, the 
well-being of a person.

The important effect of group 

membership and identity on the 
condition of life inspired Assari to 
do research in this area.

“U.S. society enhances life 

for whites, highly-educated and 
men,” Assari said. “For example, 
for every dollar that men make, the 
earning of women is just 80 cents. 
So there’s a 20 percent gender gap. 
It’s worse for race. The gap is larg-
er for race. Racial gap in income 
generation is back to what it was 
50 years ago.”

 
 
 
 
 MAX KUANG/DAILY 

Ira Glass, host of the radio show This American Life, presents Seven Things I’ve 
Learned at the Power Center on Saturday.

Over the course of two to three 

years, Assari analyzed data from the 
Americans’ Changing Lives study 
from the University’s Institute for 
Social Research. The ACL is the old-
est, ongoing, national, longitudinal 
study to follow adult behavioral, 
social and psychological health since 
1986.

Assari also used data from the 

ACL for previous research findings. 
For instance, he found education 
to be a risk factor for depression in 
Black men. Furthermore, among the 
older adult population, Black indi-
viduals appeared to die earlier from 
chronic disease than white individu-
als.

Public Health junior Jeff Sond-

heimer was intrigued by the study’s 
findings. Sondheimer, who is pur-
suing a degree in medicine, found 

the shortened life expectancy for 
women and Black individuals to be 
disheartening.

“In public health, we are taught 

that access to care and quality of care 
have a major impact on one’s health,” 
Sondheimer said. “All the more so, 
social factors such as wealth, status 
and education strongly influence 
one’s quality and access to care. I 
believe this is an interesting study 
that gets to the core of public health.”

Junior Will Schwartz, also a Pub-

lic Health student pursuing pre-
med, found the study unsurprising. 
Schwartz is hopeful the future will 
bring more studies surrounding pub-
lic policy and its effect on health.

“I think a study on possible solu-

tions to these disparities would be 
more useful than just identifying 
them,” Schwartz said.

attorney general, state legislature 
and 
U.S. 
representatives 
are 

all either Republican or have a 
Republican majority, he explained.

“When one party controls the 

process and there are no checks and 
balances, this is the result,” Moss 
said. “It’s a problem that feeds itself, 
because as soon as the state trends 
in one direction politically, they’re 
going to draw the lines so that they 
stay in power.”

Regardless of which party is in 

power, gerrymandering seems to 
have converse and extreme effects, 
making 
elections 
either 
very 

competitive or very safe. Though 
state Rep. Winnie Brinks (D–Grand 
Rapids) said elections in her district 
became more competitive when the 
district brought in more Republican 
votes, subsequently diluting the 
Democratic stronghold, Michigan 
elections have become more safe 
than competitive. The partisan 
majority in each district rarely 
changes election to election and 
instead is predictable. Whether or 
not that is due to voter preferences 
or gerrymandering is unclear.

“The 
overall 
impact 
of 

gerrymandering has been to reduce 
the number of truly competitive 
districts in the state,” Brinks 
said. “This means that there is an 
extraordinary amount of pressure 
on the candidates running in 
those races to raise hundreds of 

thousands of dollars and knock on 
tens of thousands of doors.”

While 
political 
trends 
and 

less 
competitive 
districts 
may 

have been problematic for some 
representatives, state Rep. Peter 
Lucido (R–Macomb) pushed back 
against claims that any of these 
effects are unfair.

“No one seems to be saying 

what exactly needs to be changed 
and why,” Lucido said. “They’re 
only saying it’s unfair, but what is 
actually unfair? The fact that the 
Republicans are in charge? The fact 
that they’re the majority? The fact 
that they won their elections?”

Effects
Between 1992 and 2013, there 

has been a Republican majority in 
Michigan’s Senate, and Michigan’s 
House has been nearly as red. In 
nearly every recent election for 
Michigan’s House and Senate, 
Michigan Democrats received more 
votes, but Michigan Republicans 
have held onto power. When the 
popular vote isn’t reflected in 
representatives, many argue that 
politicians are choosing voters 
instead of vice-versa. 

This comes with another 

problem. Voters see their votes 
as less effective, as the majority 
opinion 
isn’t 
implemented, 

possibly breeding voter apathy. 
As 
explained 
by 
Brinks, 

decreased 
voter 
turnout 
is 

one of the worst side effects of 
gerrymandering.

GERRYMANDERING

Later, he discussed how the 

show’s “chatty” tone helped make 
way for the show’s unprecedented 
success without any marketing 
once it began to broadcast as a 
podcast. 

“It became very successful, 

very very quickly,” Glass said. “It’s 
basically, the aesthetics of the 
internet — the internet has this 
feeling of like, it’s just me talking 
to you, one to one, whether you’re 
doing it over Twitter, Facebook or 
a blog.”

In his ninth lesson titled “The 

Power 
of 
Not 
Seeing,” 
Glass 

shared how radio can act as way of 
humanizing and can create empathy 
for others regardless of any other 
aspect of a person’s identity. He 
used the translated audio of a Syrian 
refugee 
mother 
describing 
the 

psychological trauma her son is facing 
in the aftermath of escaping Aleppo 
to emphasize this point.

“I think it helps with an American 

audience that you don’t see her,” 
Glass spoke. “If you saw, you’d see 
she’s wearing a hijab, which is like a 
headscarf, but just hearing her voice 
you don’t get any information that’d 
make you think she’s any different 
from you. You don’t think that’s 
just some Muslim lady, you think 
that’s a mom. Radio is a machine for 
empathy.”

OPINION

T

here is a scene in the 
biopic 
“Malcolm 
X” 

directed by Spike Lee that 

has always stuck with me in one of 
the most chilling and devastating 
ways possible. As Malcolm Little, 
soon to take the last name X, is 
beginning to adopt the teachings 
of Elijah Muhammad and the 
Nation of Islam, he is prompted 
by one of his mentors to define the 
words “white” and “black” using 
Webster’s dictionary. He reads 
aloud that white is defined as, “the 
color of new snow; the opposite of 
black; free from spot or blemish 
such as moral impurity; innocent, 
without evil intent; and harmless.” 

Like Malcolm X, portrayed by 

Denzel Washington, I was shaken 
and disturbed by this discovery. 
Does that inadvertently imply that 
those who are white, technically … 
by definition, are pure, innocent 
and honest? While those who are 
Black are hostile and wicked? 
The scene I described previously 
in the “Malcolm X” movie ends 
with his realization about the 
dictionary, as he asks his mentor, 
“this is written by white folks, 
right?”

There is another definition I 

would like to share, it is for the 
word “numb.” It is defined as, 
“unable to think, feel, or react 
normally because of something 
that shocks or upsets you.” I am 
stating this definition because 
I want there to be absolutely 
no mistaking the way I felt 
after learning that the police 
officer who murdered Philando 
Castile was found not guilty 
of 
manslaughter 
charges. 
I 

am numb to the fact that an 
innocent man was mercilessly 
killed in front of his girlfriend 
and child for reaching into his 
pocket. Additionally, I am truly 
disheartened because of the fact 
that I expected this. I expected 

his murderer to walk free. I 
expected the Castile family to 
unsuccessfully seek justice and 
find peace. I expected a group 
of our peers, fellow American 
citizens, who served as jurors to 
justify an innocent Black man 
being slain at the hands of the 
police — those meant to protect 
and serve. Can you imagine 
that? Being so accustomed to 
disadvantage that you can no 
longer picture a life without 
it? 
Knowing 
that 
injustice, 

discrimination 
and 
violence 

against the community in which 
you belong is so frequent that 
you can only be left with the 
assumption that it should happen? 
Can you imagine knowing that 
essentially you can be killed 
because of a definition? Because 
let’s face the facts, the police 
officer who murdered Philando 
Castile assessed his response to 
what he considered a dangerous 
situation based on the realization 
that Castile was Black. And that 
must have meant he was foul and 
hostile, right? Can you imagine 
knowing deep in your heart that 
this is bound to happen again?

I must confess it has been a 

struggle to write this piece. At 
first I was scared that it would 
be disregarded as yet another 
reaction. Or that I would present 
myself as yet another disgruntled 
Black person. I feared that my 
words would be drowned out 
by activists that roar cries of 
justice and change or maybe by 
those who view this ruling as 
the correct decision. I thought, 
who am I to speak about this? 
What difference do my words 
make in the grand scheme of 
things? I succumbed to the 
intense pressure of attempting 
to 
differentiate 
myself 
from 

the rest. How could I make 
this honest, raw and genuine? 

How could I make it something 
that would stick with readers? 
Intimidated by all of these 
questions and my own fear, I 
figured — I’ll just leave it alone, 
I will think of another topic to 
write about.

But 
then 
I 
thought, 
was 

Bill Maher scared when on 
national television he used the 
n-word in a tasteless joke? Was 
the assailant who vandalized 
LeBron James’s home by spray 
painting the n-word on his 
front gate scared? Is our own 
president 
scared 
anytime 

he 
tweets 
something 
rude, 

inflammatory 
or 
outlandish? 

The answer is no. Each of these 
individuals have said what they 
want 
and 
more 
importantly 

what they mean. None of them 
were scared, because they are 
under the impression that their 
words matter. That they can, 
and should, speak openly and 
freely. An impression which I 
too should have. So here is what 
I have to say…

Philando Castile was a father, 

son and friend. He was murdered 
for being Black. Our justice 
system has validated that this 
is not wrong, just as they have 
before in the past. The worst part 
about it is, these sorts of tragedies 
more than likely will continue 
in the future until systemic 
oppression is eliminated and 
lasting change will occur.

Until then, can you imagine 

having to wait for such drastic 
transformation, 
including 

not 
only 
redesigning 
the 

infrastructure of the branches of 
our government, but additionally 
eradicating 
bias, 
prejudice, 

oppressive behavior and racist 
ideals 
from 
generations 
of 

people? You are left to live with 
a target on your back because of 
the color of your skin. You must

“

You shot four bullets into 
him, sir,” were the words 
Lavish Reynolds, uttered over 

Facebook livestream after Officer 
Jeronimo Yanez shot Philando 
Castile on July 6, 2016. Both 
the livestream and the recently 
uncovered dash cam video are 
very disturbing, but they are also 
enlightening and representative of 
the African-American experience 
with 
law 
enforcement. 
This 

is 
particularly 
evident 
when 

observing 
(1) 
the 
language 

Castile and Reynolds used when 
addressing Yanez and (2) the 
Reynolds’ instinct to livestream 
the incident.

The dash cam video shows us 

the automatic fear that the police 
put into Castile. He is so worried 
about something going wrong that 
he feels the need to calmly inform 
Yanez, “Sir, I have to tell you that I 
do have a firearm on me.”

Countless encounters of when 

police are surprised by someone’s 
firearm, legal or not, have resulted 
in the worst. Castile tells Yanez he 
has a firearm to make sure Yanez 
knows he isn’t up to anything 
nefarious. Who would warn an 
officer about his firearm before 
using it?

Many cite that the victims 

of police brutality ask for it by 
being disrespectful to the officer, 
however this incident goes to 
show that many times it doesn’t 
matter how respectful you are — 
sometimes “sir” doesn’t cut it.

Even after watching Yanez kill 

her boyfriend, Reynolds still has 
the will to address the officer as 
“sir,” saying, “You shot four bullets 
into him, sir.” The fear of also 
being shot and blamed for being 
disrespectful continues after an 
officer has killed an innocent man. 
The officer deserves no “sir” at 
this point, but Reynolds finds it 
imperative to her own safety.

This language helps show the 

lengths that African-Americans 
have to go to stay safe in the face of 
law enforcement. Carefully placed 
“sirs” and deliberate warnings 
are representative of the fear that 
police produce.

Not only do encounters with the 

police spark fear, but they are also 
a call to action. This is to say that 
when Yanez shot Castile, Reynolds 
fought through the grief of the 
incident and had the instinct to 
document the injustice. She knew 
the fight against police brutality 
would be furthered by showing 
what had just happened, so she 
livestreamed almost immediately 
after 
shots 
had 
been 
fired. 

Personally, I would have never 
had the thought to livestream 
after my significant other had 
been shot, but it just goes to show 
how even through the worst, 
African-Americans have to fight 
for improved conditions.

The livestream shows how 

documenting a greater injustice is 
of a higher priority than personal 
emotion. This is a priority that 
many of us will never have to deal 
with.

Despite the unjust treatment 

uncovered by this case, many 
people blame Castile for his death 
by saying he should’ve stopped 
reaching. We live in a world where 
we punish people of different skin 
tone for existing, then blame them 
for acting innocently. I don’t doubt 
that Yanez was a good person and 
not outwardly racist, but it is okay 
to blame law enforcement. Yanez 
murdered an innocent man. If 
we don’t punish cops for acting 
inappropriately, things will never 
change.

What I learned from Philando Castile

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A

lmost every day, we wake up, 
roll over in our beds and turn 
off our alarm*. Sometimes 

that is in a digital clock*, but knowing 
our generation, it is most likely a 
cellphone*. After tapping the screen*, 
we hop out of bed and turn on the 
light*. We may run to the restroom, 
and turn on the faucet* for a glass 
of water. After that, we might 
brush our teeth with a toothbrush* 
and wash our face with a bar of 
soap*. We enter the kitchen and 
take the cup of coffee from the 
coffeemaker*. After tossing some 
oatmeal in the microwave*, we hop 
onto the internet* to read or catch 
up on work. After running out the 
door, we hop on the bus* or in our 
car* to start the day.

Simply in this morning routine, 

science research consumed our 
schedule. Every asterisk next to 
an object or concept included 
copious 
amounts 
of 
scientific 

understanding 
and 
countless 

hours of development to create 
the technology. Our generation 
has been consumed by the use of 
cellphones, almost as permanent 
attachments of our psyche. The 
Starbucks machines making that 
latte you’re drinking? Science and 
mathematics went into developing 
it. 
That 
fancy 
watch 
you’re 

wearing? Science and mathematics 
developed it. Even while we are 
constantly surrounded by scientific 
innovation, I notice that we 
overlook the importance of science 
research and development in our 
everyday lives. And I am not simply 
writing because I am in a university 
setting, but as an individual who 
observes many Americans who 
don’t even recognize the scientific 
research that they benefit from 
every second of their lifetimes.

The lack of awareness from 

many Americans on how rooted 
scientific 
research 
is 
to 
the 

American psyche demonstrates 
the growing issue of our scientific 
literacy. Science education is not 
only faltering in schools but also in 
the general public. This is creating 
a large part of the consumer 
industry that lacks regard for the 
hard work and complex science 
that went behind developing the 
iPhone or the car he or she drives. 
There are two issues to look at with 
regards to science literacy: science 
in secondary education and science 
in the general public.

High school science education is 

heavily criticized in many states. A 
staggering 2016 assessment found 
that 64 percent of high school 

graduates failed to meet college-
readiness benchmarks in science, 
in a country where the benchmarks 
are even lower than many other 
countries. With poor support to 
science education, it should be 
no surprise that of the 17,000 
postsecondary U.S. and Puerto 
Rican students, about 40 percent 
of those who began studying in 
science disciplines at the beginning 
of college eventually achieved a 
degree in that field. Even worse, 
among women and minorities, 
that 
number 
is 
20 
percent. 

Science education clearly has a 
perseverance problem. People are 
leaving science, perhaps because 
it is difficult, but mostly, I believe, 
because it has public relations 
issues. Large swaths of scientific 
community don’t know how to 
communicate their research to the 
average American citizen.

As an article published in the 

Washington Post states, “when 
Americans gets surveyed about 
science, we learn that they don’t 
know a lot about it — and then 
we proceed to lament how dumb 
they are.” Though this might be 
typical, the scientific perseverance 
and public relations problems 
might be due to two reasons. 
Firstly, secondary school science 
is often taught in a lecture-styled, 
memorize-based classroom, where 
trial-and-error, research-designed 
curricula 
is 
not 
emphasized. 

Secondly, the scientific literature 
and 
academic 
community 
is 

removed from the vast majority 
of the general public, creating a 
massive difference in the opinions 
of scientists and the public — 
adding only the growing distrust 
of the science community in the 
general public.

In our nation’s high school 

classrooms, there has been a 
greater shift to develop curriculum 
that doesn’t simply require students 
to memorize the emergent truths 
that we have come to agree upon 
as a scientific community. Often, it 
involves allowing students to build 
their own models and design their 
experiments, 
developing 
their 

own understanding and coming 
to the same conclusions as the 
scientists. Scientists don’t simply 
sit and simply memorize; therefore 
students shouldn’t either. This 
style of active learning, however, 
is not being implemented in many 
schools across the nation . Too 
often, you hear students saying, “I 
am not a science/math person,” yet 
these techniques can encourage 

creativity and produce a more 
engaging subject. In addition, 
working with students in this 
manner makes them more active 
citizens, appreciating how the 
scientific community and research 
is integral to the American identity.

A 2014 American Association for 

the Advancement of Science study 
confirmed many of the issues of the 
public’s science literacy. According 
to the survey, which looked at the 
opinions of both scientists and 
the general public, the percent 
difference of opinion on major 
scientific 
issues 
is 
practically 

night and day. While 37 percent 
of U.S citizens surveyed said it 
was safe to eat GMOs, 88 percent 
of the scientific community says 
GMOs are harmless. Similarly, 
89 percent of scientists believe it 
is morally OK to use animals in 
research, while only 47 percent of 
public agree. Even scarier is that 98 
percent of scientists regard human 
evolution to exist, while only 65 
percent of the public agrees. These 
are just a few of the significant 
differences between the science 
community and the non-science 
community. This divide, in my 
view, has created the massive 
lack of scientific appreciation in 
our country, furthering the issues 
in education. So how does the 
scientific community engage with 
the public? An answer may lie in 
politics and social outreach.

Though many have come to 

criticize Malcolm Gladwell for 
broad claims and conclusions, I do 
believe he is doing a great service 
by bringing science awareness to the 
public. The same can be said for Bill 
Nye, Oliver Sacks, Stephen Hawking, 
Brian Greene, Neil deGrasse Tyson 
and a few more. Organizations 
such as 314 Action, which looks to 
support scientists in public office 
and spread scientific literacy, are 
crucial to changing the dialogue on 
science education and appreciation. 
These individuals and organizations 
are entirely necessary to address 
the PR problem science has and 
humanize the area. Science is a part 
of American identity, and individuals 
and organizations are doing the 
necessary actions so that the next 
time you look at your cellphone, 
you 
appreciate 
the 
countless 

hours developing the technology 
and science behind its various 
components.

ABCs of science

T

olerance has often been 
thought of as a positive 
attribute to society and 

a necessary constituent for the 
promotion of civil rights. However, 
if equality and the improvement 
of civil rights is the end goal, the 
function of tolerance in society 
does not achieve such results. 
Though tolerance is indeed a 
preferred end to intolerance, it does 
not bring about equality or justice 
to a society; in fact, it highlights 
the vulnerabilities of a a group of 
people to another and perpetuates 
societal oppression. For policies to 
solve the full spectrum of modern 
social injustice, a firm initiative 
must be taken in place of tolerance, 
against injustice and inequality. 

Perhaps one of the reasons society 

is inclined to look at tolerance as 
a solution to hatred and bigotry is 
because we often have seen harsh 
examples of intolerance, usually 
through infamous events or political 
regimes. Nazi Germany in World 
War II, the present day totalitarian 
Republic of North Korea and the 
recent surge of racist, homophobic 
and religious hate crimes in the 
United States are all examples. 
These are indeed heinous examples, 
but it does not imply that tolerance 
promotes 
a 
more 
equal 
and 

harmonious society. Tolerance, in 
fact, allows for society to be more 
divided and implies that minority 
groups who are oppressed should 
simply be left alone and “tolerated.” 
Social problems today demand a firm 
course of action confronting the root 
issues of injustice.

For many years in the United 

States a variety of religions have 
coexisted. Religious freedom has 
been a powerful force since the 
founding of the country. Though 
a majority consists of a variety of 
Christian groups, Judaism and 
Islam are a close second. Has 
the reason for the coexistence 
of religions been the result of 
tolerance? Have the Christians 
merely tolerated the Muslims, 
and vice versa? Today in this 
country, witnessed to multiple and 
rising existing tensions between 
the two religions. Usually, these 
tensions 
originated 
through 

radical extremists on both sides 
and politicians stirring up fear and 
bigotry. To practice the exercise 
of tolerance now would imply a 
silent hatred that has not yet been 
acted on. For religious groups to 
coexist yet not acknowledge the 
building tensions between the 

groups exasperates the animosity. 
In place of a silent tolerance, each 
group should propose to support 
each other in light of a common 
goal of a free and accepting society. 
By no means does this hint that the 
different beliefs should merge, but 
instead, that they should recognize 
one another with respect for those 
beliefs and not be silent in their 
support.

Racism has exhibited an even 

greater display of how tolerance 
alone has created divisions and 
mistrust. Perhaps this a more 
obvious example. To say that 
people of other ethnic groups and 
races are only tolerated would have 
a serious negative connotation. 
Again, 
practicing 
community 

with one another is a part of the 
resistance. However, community 
and acceptance also means that 
unless there is a decided action 
to involve ourselves in the fight 
against the marginalization of 
racial 
minority 
groups, 
there 

is a complicit obstruction of 
justice. Tolerance, in this case, 
is 
complacency 
and 
refusing 

to engage for a just and unified 
society.

The LGBTQ community can 

relate to what tolerance means 
for them in a very personal way. 
The stares of bystanders when a 
same-sex couple hold hands or 
the distancing of friends in silent 
disagreement display ways that 
tolerance is used. The mistrust 
that is created by this silent 
disapproval divides society as 
well as creating distance between 
sexual orientations.

Whether it is racism or religious 

discrimination or homophobia, 
intolerance is how we often have 
labeled the obstacle of equality 
and justice for all in society. The 
question is not whether tolerance is 
better in comparison to intolerance, 
but rather, does tolerance promote 
justice? Clearly, tolerance without 
action is just as guilty in its part 
of creating a divided society. Each 
community needs to know that 
they are not simply tolerated by 
the majority, but rather that their 
uniqueness adds an irreplaceable 
quality to society. It is essential 
that their marginalization leads 
to protest and resistance from the 
society they are a part of, and the 
justice due to them is sought by 
those in power.

New album ‘4:44’ brings us back to ‘Lemonade’

Four-bar looped soul samples, oh 

how we’ve missed you.

4:44 opens with the dense, 

layered “Kill Jay-Z.” While a siren 
reminiscent 
of 
“Workinonit” 

recursively spaces in and out, Hov 
recounts 
shooting 
his 
brother, 

stabbing 
someone 
over 
album 

bootlegs and his intoxication with 
fame, among other things. Faint 
strings gently weep between his 
lines, 
swiveling 
around 
gentle 

piano and alternating, distorted 
vocals. “We know the pain is real / 
But you can’t heal what you never 
reveal.” The track is cleansing, 
and the admission of weakness 
and wrongdoing sets the album’s 
apologetic, confessional tone.

This is the leanest project of JAY-

Z’s career. Nearly half the length of 
all his other records, at 36 minutes, 
every cut on 4:44 feels essential. Yet, 
the record’s length is misleading 
because the real richness and 
complexity only unpacks itself 
after many listens. The album 
pioneers a cohesive, distinct sound 
that is largely a callback to the 
sample-heavy hip hop of the early 
2000s. Where looped vocals lay 
foundational points of contact, the 
drum arrangements are subtle, 
often sitting distant in the back 
behind piano segments or sections 

of brass. JAY-Z is innovating in 
his own creative vacuum rather 
than looking to compete with 
newcomers. He’s sold more records 
than all of them combined, at points 
mocking their contrived artistry, 
making flat-footed “skrrt” noises on 
“Moonlight,” for one.

In the era when artists trade 

and rip beats on the internet 
without ever meeting in person, 
the 
one-rapper-

one-producer 
method of this LP is 
particularly curious. 
There is a chemistry 
here 
that 
some 

proclaimed 
duos 

never attain. The beats don’t just 
back Hov’s bars: they mesh and 
intermingle with them. JAY-Z’s 
verses don’t just fill out the track: 
they extend the possibilities of No 
I.D.’s canvases.

“The Story of O.J.” is the most 

politically charged track of the 
project; it’s no wonder that it’s one 
of the album’s two tracks to tout 
a Nina Simone sample. He chants 
almost meditatively: “Light ni**a, 
dark ni**a, faux ni**a, real ni**a / 
Rich ni**a, poor ni**a, house ni**a, 
field ni**a / Still n**a / Still ni**a.” 
Pitch-shifted vocals are thinly 
sliced, rounding out the percussive 
melody. Hov discusses black values 
in modern America and proposes 
investing in their own communities 
rather than blowing money at 

the club. He opens up on his own 
personal experience, recounting 
how he should’ve bought property 
in gentrifying Brooklyn. Brilliant 
piano arpeggios are tucked behind 
some of the best flows we’ve seen 
from him in a while: “I turn a two to 
a four, four to an eight / I turn my life 
into a nice first week release date.” 
With the dampened hi-hats sitting 
in the distance, the beat’s bread-

and-butter 
(Read: 

kicks 
& 
snares) 

doesn’t 
beg 
for 

attention — instead 
the real brilliance 
of the track shines 
through in its tiny 

details: the meaty, trashcan-bashing 
couple-second drum break that 
pops up only a couple times between 
low, indistinct revving noises.

Even 
though 
the 
album’s 

cohesive sound revolves around 
soul, the aesthetic stretches into 
reggae/dancehall 
on 
two 
cuts: 

“Caught Their Eyes” and “Bam.” 
As Frank Ocean continues to make 
his case as an extremely versatile 
vocalist on the former, the latter 
sees Hov reprising his traditional 
braggadocious rap between Damian 
Marley choruses: “I was moving 
them kilos, help you move your 
peoples / Sometimes you need your 
ego, gotta remind these fools.”

gripping letter on ‘4:44’

‘Despicable Me’ 
proves chaotic

Fun for the kids, not for the discerning

FILM REVIEW

I went into “Despicable Me 

3” with the hope that in the 
best case it would surpass my 
expectations for a third movie 
in a series. In the worst case, it 
would ruin the “Despicable Me” 
franchise for me. Predictably, 
the movie lingered in between, 
neither pleasantly stunning me 
nor falling completely flat.

One of the centralized themes 

that made the “Despicable Me” 
franchise so charming was its 
focus on love and parenting. 
The first movie was charismatic, 
captivating audiences as they 
watched 
Gru’s 

life change with 
the love of his 
adoptive 
girls. 

“Despicable Me 3” 
attempts to mimic 
this by focusing on 
Gru’s relationship 
with his long lost 
brother, Dru, and 
Lucy’s 
struggles 

as a new mother to the girls. 
Not only does the movie use 
the same tired “plot twist” 
of a secret twin sibling, but it 
doesn’t give either relationship 
the attention they need to 
fully evolve. We see very small 
amounts of tension between Gru 
and Dru or Lucy and the girls, 
and then the relationships are 
perfect in the end with little 
time reserved for the characters 
to face the consequences of 
their actions. The most touching 
moment we see relationship-wise 
is when the minion Mel pines for 
Gru in prison, remembering how 
affectionate and selfless Gru was.

“Despicable 
Me 
3” 
tries 

to pack too much in at once, 
introducing 
Gru’s 
long 
lost 

brother while Agnes searches for 
a unicorn and villain Balthazar 
Bratt uncomfortably shimmies 
around everywhere. The movie 
is distracted by the action and 
these side plots, hoping to find 
something that will appeal to 
everyone. Balthazar Bratt proves 

to be a moderately entertaining 
villain, with a unique backstory 
as an 80s child star who became 
a villain after his show was 
cancelled when he hit puberty. 
Yet his character becomes too 
much to handle because he 
demands so much attention, 
much like the rest of the subplots.

“Despicable Me 3” still has 

some funny moments. It relies 
on slapstick humor for the 
children and 80s references for 
the parents. There is no lack of 
comedy in every action scene, 
ranging 
from 
Dru’s 
failings 

as a villain to the dance fights 
between Balthazar Bratt and 
Gru. Margot, Edith and Agnes are 
cute and funny as they each deal 

with growing up, 
but even Agnes’s 
cuteness is subdued 
by 
too 
many 
of 

her high pitched 
screams.

One of the only 

redeeming qualities 
of 
the 
movie 
is 

the antics of the 
minions. 
Their 

dance routines choreographed 
to Pharell Williams songs are 
entertaining 
and 
refreshing 

against the chaotic plot of the 
movie. Likewise, the animation of 
these scenes is visually stunning. 
However, switching back and 
forth between the minions and 
the rest of the characters adds 
further confusion to the plot, 
highlighting the lack of focus on 
any one centralized theme.

“Despicable Me 3” has a 

lot to live up to, coming from 
such a successful franchise. 
It is difficult for the third 
— or fourth if you include 
“Minions” — movie to surpass 
its predecessors. The movie 
still entertains, but not with the 
charm or fluidity of “Despicable 
Me.” Instead, it struggles to 
find its way and overstimulates 
at times. It may disappoint 
adult fans of the franchise 
who yearn for the delightful 
characterization and love in the 
first movie, but it will still be an 
amusing watch for children.

TV REVIEW

HBO

‘Silicon Valley’ ended its fourth season this past Sunday
‘Silicon’ Season Four finale 
bids goodbye to Bachman

Finale pleases with comedy, disappoints in goodbye to Miller

The success of any “Silicon 

Valley” episode has always started 
and ended with its characters. When 
the characters are connecting, the 
show’s jokes seem to build off of each 
other and produce a constant stream 
of laughs, à la the earlier Season Four 
episode 
“Intellectual 
Property.” 

Conversely, when the characters are 
out of sync, the show’s gags struggle 
to land, as shown in another Season 
Four episode, “The Patent Troll.”

Fortunately for “Silicon Valley,” 

it has an outstanding cast that 
almost always appears to be in 
concert with one another to create 
on-screen hilarity, and the show’s 
Season Four finale “Server Error” is 
no exception. The episode fittingly 
concludes the series’s exceptional 
fourth season that featured an 
effective balance between low-brow 
humor and critical character and 
plot progressions.

One of “Silicon Valley”’s more 

shocking developments this season 
has been the extent of Richard 
Hendricks’s (Thomas Middleditch, 
“The Final Girls”) transition to a 
shrewd entrepreneur at the expense 
of his moral code. Over the course 
of the season, Hendricks has turned 
from a somewhat naïve executive 
of a fledgling video chat company 
to the visionary CEO of a bold 
start-up seeking to revolutionize 
the internet. Hendricks’s turn has 
been characterized by deceitful 
and cutthroat business maneuvers, 
which are highlighted in “Server 

Error” when Hendricks coldly 
rejects Gavin Belsam’s (Matt Ross, 
“American Psycho”) partnership 
proposal by telling Belsam, “I 
think basically you’re just a server 
company now, and we intend to 
make servers obsolete, so… in the 
end, I’ll be the one devouring you.”

“Silicon Valley”’s stunning finale 

also sees Hendricks’s affair with Dan 
Melcher’s (Jake Broder, “In a Day”) 
wife come to light. The series has 
teased a revelation of Hendricks’s 
short-lived sex romp with Liz 
(Leisha Haley, “The L Word”) in 
previous episodes, so its emergence 

in the finale isn’t unexpected. Rather, 
what was unexpected was the affair 
itself, which always seemed to be 
too outrageous for Hendricks, to the 
point it infringed on believability of 
the affair. Instead, the real function 
of Hendricks’s cuckoldry was to 
serve as a barometer of his personal 
transformation to an unscrupulous 
entrepreneur.

Hendricks’s newfound persona 

takes center stage in “Server Error” 
and figures to be a significant piece 
of the show’s storyline next season, 
too. However, “Silicon Valley”’s 
fifth season will test the series, as 
it tries to recover from the exit of 
Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller, “Office 
Christmas 
Party”), 
which 
was 

bungled in “Server Error.”

As 
the 
crass, 
pot-smoking 

landlord of Pied Piper, Bachman has 
become the source of much of the 
series’s ridiculous style of humor. 
His constant schemes against Jian 
Yang (Jimmy O. Yang, “Patriot’s 
Day”) throughout Season Four 
provided 
“Silicon 
Valley” 
with 

utterly hilarious scenes, including 
Yang’s 
hilarious 
impression 
of 

Bachman in “Intellectual Property.” 
Despite 
being 
such 
a 
crucial 

character, 
Bachman’s 
exit 
was 

rushed and poorly executed even 
in the little amount of time it was 
given. While it was funny to watch 
Belsam negotiate for Bachman to 
smoke opium in Tibet for five years, 
it was an underwhelming finish for 
such an integral character on the 
show.

While 
Bachman’s 
exit 
will 

profoundly disrupt “Silicon Valley,” 
the series has such a stellar cast of 
veteran comedians that it should 
be able to sustain its overwhelming 
success. The show’s main stars — 
Middleditch, Kumail Nanjiani (“The 
Big Sick”), Martin Starr (“Freaks and 
Geeks”), Josh Brener (“In the Loop”) 
and Zach Woods (“The Internship”) 
— continue to shine due to their 
superb chemistry. “Silicon Valley” 
is also boosted by the expanding 
roles occupied by Hoover (Chris 
Williams, “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) 
and Ed Chen (Tim Chiou, “Love Is 
All You Need?”). Williams especially 
emerged in this fourth season

naïve obedience to Hooli. With more

Bachman’s departure.

‘Lake’ is a vivid 
story collection

BOOK REVIEW

With the opening sentence in 

the first of his new collection of 
short stories “The Girl of the Lake,” 
Bill Roorbach catapults us back 
into the world of middle school 
adventures: “Bobby Mullendore 
was sick of sixth grade, especially 
without his best friend Jack B., plus 
it was spring.” In a move as old as 
time, Bobby forges a note and skips 
school for several days in a row. He 
spies on a neighboring estate in his 
spy gear and gets caught. Terrified 
at 
first 
by 
the 
commanding 

personages around Harbinger Hall 
(also the title of the story), Bobby 
meets the old man who owns it; he 
begins giving Bobby lessons on his 
days off from school, starting with 
Russian history but quickly moving 
on to other subjects. In a few pages 
that function as a montage, we 
see Bobby grow up and follow in 
the footsteps, in a way, of that old 
man, but the story ends with a 
simple, elegant twist that leaves 
you questioning what you think 
you know.

The rest of Roorbach’s stories 

operate the same way, sketching 
simple vignettes with refreshing 
clarity. In “Kiva,” a self-admitted 
“omega” boy tries with all his 
might to win the heart of the alpha 
girl; his father tries to help him, 
and explains that he must not 
try to imitate the behavior of the 
alpha males, but rather learn how 
to win her over in other ways (so 
naturally, he tries to learn how to 
do a french braid). His father takes 

the two of them and the girl’s two 
sisters out on a picnic, where more 
than a few people decide to take a 
chance on a sexual encounter, in a 
bizarrely rapid succession.

“Fall” peels back the layers of 

sentiment you can find yourself 
wrapped up in when someone 
dies, and you feel emotions more 
complicated 
than 
just 
grief; 

“Some Should” details the utterly 
unpredictable direction a blind 

date with a priest — a sinner just the 
same — can go in (and this one has a 
shout-out to the Residential College 
at 
the 
University). 
“Princesa” 

shows the ridiculousness of older 
men fawning over younger famous 
ingenues, a story that borders on 
absurdism.

The narrators of these stories 

feel 
like 
stenographers. 
The 

dialogue is pulled straight from 
real life, revealing feelings so 
recognizable that reading the 
stories feels like a heady case of 
déjà vu; it’s bittersweet. They cover 
how quickly things can change 
in the life of the schoolyard, the 
cooling of passion between two 
people who always swore they 
would stay in touch, the kinds 
of inconceivable back stabbings 
that romantic unravelings can 
lead to, the intricate forms that 
betrayal can take in the worlds of 
art curatorship and community 
theater, and what it looks like 
when two people fall in love, if not 
at first sight, then at first rashly 
constructed plan for a future 
together. Roorbach has pushed 
the short story form to its limits, 
somehow molding worlds with 
depth in only a few pages each 
time, making them breathtaking in 
their simplicity.

City Council debates efficacy of AAPD review

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

Though 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Council unanimously approved a 
resolution to fund a second phase 

of the third-party review of the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
at the council meeting Monday 
night, several councilmembers 
expressed their concerns with the 
efficacy of the process so far. They 
raised questions of whether the 

additional appropriations were 
necessary and whether Hillard 
Heintze LLC — the Chicago-based 
security firm in charge of the 
review — had been implementing 
the best methods available.

The 
resolution 
added 
an 

additional $30,000 in funds to the 
original $200,000 approved in 
February. According to a memo to 
council from Debra Kirby, Senior 
Vice President at Hillard Heintze, 
the $30,000 will fund “interviews 
with command staff regarding 
community engagement, off-site 
training and brainstorming session 
on community engagement and 
development 
of a strategy 
and plan for 
enhanced 
community 
engagement.”

While the 

first phase of 
the 
review 

was intended 
to 
involve 

community 
outreach and 
listening 
to 

perspectives 
on 
the 

AAPD 
from 

community 
members, the 
second phase 
was intended 
to implement some form of civilian 
review board for the AAPD.

Members of the community 

have expressed their disapproval 
of the process so far, saying 
Hillard Heintze’s outreach efforts 
to minority communities have 
been insufficient. Councilmember 
Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4), among 
other councilmembers, said he 
heard residents’ concerns.

“At times I’ve been rather 

disappointed 
in 
their 
ability 

to reach members of minority 
communities who could really get 
good information about people 
who may in fact have a legitimate 
complaint about our police,” he 
said.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) shared 
Eaton’s concerns and said Hillard 
Heintze had also failed to properly 
communicate 
with 
the 
city’s 

Human 
Rights 
Commission, 

despite their active involvement 
in the review.

“Hillard Heintze has appeared 

before the HRC, but this extension 
of work was never discussed 
or brought before the HRC,” 
she said. “The HRC has been a 
watchdog on this whole issue, and 
they have raised several serious 
concerns with the consultants 
regarding especially reaching out 
to minorities. I hope they take this 

seriously. The HRC has been giving 
really constructive help in terms of 
which groups they should be going 
to, where they should be going to 
and reaching out.”

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 

(D–Ward 2) was surprised the firm 
was asking for more money. He 
cautioned that the request should 
be considered carefully, especially 

given errors 
the firm had 
made during 
the 
first 

phase of the 
review.

“I 
have 

trouble 
when a large 
contract like 
this 
comes 

back with an 
additional 
ask 
that 

seems 
to 

have 
been 

part of the 
original 
request,” 
he said. “I’ll 
note now in 

something that one constituent has 
highlighted to me is that the survey 
contained an error in it, and it gives 
me pause about the process and 
some feedback we’ve received from 
members of the community. So my 
inclination would be to think more 
about what we are getting here and 
see if this money can be sourced 
from the existing contract.”

Asking 
City 
Administrator 

Howard Lazarus if the community-
wide survey on attitudes regarding 
the AAPD was still available to the 
public, Lazarus replied that it was, 
but they would not be considering 
new responses.

“There comes a point in time 

where we have to own the results 
and then implement it,” he said. “I 
think that’s where we are.”

There was also debate over 

the terminology Hillard Heintze 
used in its memo to the council 
regarding the second phase of the 
review. Though much of the talk 
around the audit prior to approval 
of the city’s contract with Hillard 
Heintze 
revolved 
around 
the 

creation of a “civilian oversight 
board,” which the chief of the 
AAPD has publicly opposed, the 
memo from Hillard Heintze used 
the term “citizen advisory board.”

Founded in 2009, Pilipino 

American Unity for Progress 
is a national nonprofit orga-
nizations that invests itself in 
engaging and empowering the 
Filipinx and FIlipinx Ameri-
can community at large in 
the United States. UniPro was 
founded on the mission to pro-
vide opportunities for Filipinx 
students in the United States 
to explore professional devel-
opment, history and policy 
rooted in the Filipinx experi-
ence. I had the honor to travel 
to New York City to attend one 
such opportunity — UniPro 
Summit 2017: Persist.

There is something inter-

esting about growing up in 
the Midwest. From where I’m 
from, the Midwest is corn-
fields, driving past those same 
cornfields endlessly for one 
form of fun, and going to the 
same Applebee’s every week-
end for the other form of fun. 
The Midwest is small towns 
like the ones I grew up in.

I even had more of an inter-

esting time as a Filipino Amer-
ican. The only opportunities 
to learn about Filipino culture 
were the very limited interac-
tions with my parents, and a 
display of minority culture is 
unfavorable outside my home. 
Speaking out is even more dif-
ficult. I lived in smallness. 
The more I grew up, the more 
I questioned my Filipino-ness.

Now after a couple of years 

into my undergraduate career, 
where I hit the ground run-
ning in terms of exploring my 
culture and civic involvement, 
comes the UniPro Summit 
2017: Persist.

I came to the UniPro Sum-

mit on a mission: to better 
myself as a leader in Filipinx 
American spaces by listening 
to other perspectives outside 
the Midwest.

From the keynote speak-

ers, I was absolutely inspired 
by their stories of persistence. 
In trying times, it is impera-
tive to keep pushing. To be 
unapologetically yourself is 
subversive enough, and the 

narratives of Geena Rocero 
and Christina Halpern serve 
as encouragement to remain 
strong. 
Workshops 
focused 

on the fundamentals of public 
speaking, adapting quickly to 
adverse situations within our 
collegiate organizations and 
addressing issues that exist 
within our communities such 
as anti-Blackness.

And even though my expe-

rience as a Filipino American 
was very different from many 
others at the conference, I still 
felt such a genuine sense of 
community. It was refreshing 
to be in a space where every-
one is so motivated to create a 
better Filipino America.

I want to take the energy 

from UniPro and bring it back 
the Midwest, which I think 
is the point of the summit. I 
must … Persist. It seems over-
ly redundant, but the central 
theme of the summit is even 
truer now than ever. Coming 
together as we are, mobiliz-
ing Filipinx Americans on a 
national scale, is an act of per-
sistence, but it’s important for 
me to use my voice to uplift 
the rest of the Midwest com-
munity by providing resources 
of education and engagement. 
While we in the Midwest pay 
homage to our cultural roots, 
we must also address the 
issues that pervade a problem-
atic US society — no matter 
how uncomfortable it is.

Growing up in a small town 

had me dreaming about trav-
eling to big cities to discover 
something bigger than me. 
UniPro gave me an opportu-
nity to fulfill that wish, and 
now my dream is to use the 
skills I’ve acquired along the 
adventure to impact Filipinx 
Americans and shatter a stag-
nant idea of smallness.

Thank you to UniPro for 

having me.

Thank you to the people I 

met who understood me as I 
am.

Thank you to the people 

I met who taught me how to 
persist from their acts of per-
sistence.

OPINION

D

ear Mr. Carlson,

I had not heard of you 

prior to the “Tucker Carlson 

Interview Request” I received to my 
work account last weekend (forgive 
me, Fox News wasn’t ever really my 
thing).

And then I looked you up a bit. And 

read about you. And watched some of 
your videos. I reread the email:

We’re looking to discuss the free 

speech bill that was proposed in 
Wisconsin, which aims to protect the 
first amendment on college campuses 
in the state. I read that you find the 
law ironic, and it would be great to 
hear more of your perspective about 
why you’re opposed to this bill. It was 
obvious to me that your producer 
read my contribution to Inside 
Higher Education where — I thought 
— I had made my stance clear. 

I am happy, however, to unpack 

more of my thinking, here, in a 
space where I control the narrative, 
uninterrupted and unedited, as I do 
not have an interest in theatrics. I will 
first focus my perspective on your 
team’s use of the word “protect.”

It is clear that you agree with 

what lawmakers in Wisconsin and 
elsewhere are attempting to achieve: 
politically neutral college campuses 
in the name of “protecting” free 
speech. Campuses where all speech 
is considered equally valuable, no 
matter how morally repugnant 
(see “The Bell Curve”), no matter 
how intellectually empty (see also 
“The Bell Curve”), no matter how 
culturally toxic (see, again, “The 
Bell Curve”) and no matter how 
psychologically 
dangerous 
(see, 

absolutely, “The Bell Curve”).

I highlight “The Bell Curve,” 

here, as it is one of the more recent 
examples out of Wisconsin — and is 
a form of speech that gloms onto the 
belief that white men are morally, 
intellectually, and psychologically 
superior to anyone not white and 
male.

This is just one example of the 

kind of speech that our white, male-
dominated Wisconsin legislature 
wishes to see protected by way 
of illegalizing even the mildest of 
opposition (and as though there are 
not already mechanisms in place to 
deal with that which is actually illegal 
activity — such as violent protest).

That being said, what if “The Bell 

Curve” argued the exact opposite 
— that white men are scientifically 
proven to be morally, intellectually 
and psychologically inferior to non-
white, 
non-male 
counterparts? 

Moreover, would you stand quite 
as stoically — as silently — behind 

campus speech that wishes to 
highlight 
the 
radicalization 
of 

young white men? What about 
speech equating whites and white 
supremacy with terrorism? To what 
extent would you stand by idly, 
as your identity is marginalized, 
minoritized, threatened and called 
into question by people who claim 
to know better, as has historically 
been the case for people of color and 
marginalized populations? If you 
wish to see this bill in Wisconsin 
come to fruition as written, then 
I invite you — in the name of 
consistency — to quietly abandon 
the very forum upon which you rail 
against social change and progress 
on a nightly basis.

Because my background and 

expertise is in literacy education, 
Mr. Carlson, I am going to draw 
from this field to argue the 
following:

There is no such thing as a 

politically neutral campus. No 
speech is neutral, no message free 
of ideology and power-relations. 
To speak at a college campus 
or educational institution is to 
encourage thought in one direction 
or another. To illegalize protest and 
campus activism in the name of 
neutrality is also a political stance 
— a politics of silencing. Moreover, 
it is to delude the public into believing 
that a depoliticized campus is possible 
when “forced” to become one by law: 
an exercise deeply dependent upon 
civic illiteracy.

In sum, when you have values — 

whether you are a talk show host, 
lawmaker, campus visitor, student 
or college administrator — you have 
politics.

To conclude, I wish to address the 

irony embedded in your stance:

You support Wisconsin’s attempts 

to “protect” free speech at the same 
time lawmakers have eliminated 
tenure protections for educators 
and researchers across the state, 
thereby threatening intellectual and 
academic freedoms — again, the 
sorts of freedoms I presume you wish 
to see “protected” (despite, I should 
point out, your stated stance against 
tenure and intellectual protections).

If you want so badly to see speech 

“protected,” can I count on you, Mr. 
Carlson, to stand beside me when my 
academic and public articles about 
white privilege and white supremacy 
fall into the wrong hands, thereby 
resulting in threats to my livelihood 
and well-being? Will you stand with 
me, Mr. Carlson, should Wisconsin’s 
Board of Regents make decisions 
about my future — decisions not in 

my favor — if and when they disagree 
with my research and teaching about 
whiteness and white supremacy — 
an objectively large and growing 
field of study dating as far back as the 
beginning of the 20th century?

Will you pull for me, Mr. Carlson, 

when groups like Professor Watchlist 
and 
The 
College 
Fix 
publish 

something about me and my work, 
in an unveiled attempt to harm 
my career? Am I being cynical as 
I presume to know the answers to 
these questions?

Make absolutely no mistake: to 

claim neutrality is a political act; to 
force neutrality is a political act; to 
illegalize protest is a political act. To 
silence opposition is a political act. 
To support campus speech while 
railing against tenure protections is 
an exercise in hypocrisy, at best.

I am not sure that it’s “free speech” 

you purport to want to protect 
as much as you wish to protect 
perspectives that have only ever 
advantaged you and many of your 
followers at the expense of social 
progress. Rather than hide behind 
a thinly veiled commitment to free 
speech, you might ask yourself: 
Which speech do I want protected 
on college campuses and at whose 
expense? Whose speech do I want 
protected and at what social cost?

Finally, it is out of reverence and 

love for social progress, education 
and my institution that I respectfully 
declined submitting myself as your 
punching bag. But perhaps I’ll be 
up for it next time, if and when 
tenure and intellectual freedom are 
reinstated in the state of Wisconsin, 
and if and when you come to terms 
with the reality that you cannot 
support one without supporting the 
other.

CHRISTINA BERCHINI| OP-ED

I

n 
just 
under 
a 
century, 

humanity has gone on to create 
revolutionary medical devices that 

have saved millions of lives. Within the 
next century, doctors will be replaced 
by artificial intelligence, surgeries done 
by world-renowned surgeons will be 
conducted by near-perfect robots and 
citizens of developing countries will 
be receiving proper healthcare. These 
aren’t optimistic statements, but in fact, 
they are very realistic, and we should 
accept this change. But to what extent 
do we sacrifice what it means to be 
human to the hands of artificiality?

By placing a dependency on tests 

such as CAT scans and MRIs, “we not 
only overlook simple diagnoses that 
can be diagnosed at a treatable, early 
stage, but we’re losing so much more 
than that,” Dr. Abraham Verghese, a 
physician and professor at Stanford 
University School of Medicine, stated 
during his TED talk “A doctor’s touch.” 
“We’re losing a ritual.”

He goes on to describe this ritual as 

“the power of the human hand — to 
touch, to comfort, to diagnose and to 
bring about treatment.” This is not to say 
the medical scans have been faulty, but 
rather, it is our growing dependence on 
them that raises this concern. I mention 
this because during my sophomore year 
of high school, I had injured my wrist 
after falling in basketball practice. The 
pain was gradually increasing, as was 
the swelling. Nonetheless, I went home 
with some ice assuming it would heal 
overnight. The next day, my wrist was 
more swollen and the intensity of pain 
was greater, which resulted a trip to the 
hospital to get X-rays. Not one thought 
had occurred to go to my pediatrician 
to get an expert opinion before having 
to get X-rays. This conscious yet quick 
decision showcases a prime example of 
how quick we are to turn to technology 
rather than seek a health professional’s 
opinion.

For some reason, we need proof of 

the disease or injury before we fully 
trust the expertise of a doctor. But 
when it comes down to the matter, 
it is the doctor’s words that are most 
comforting while we strive to distance 
ourselves from the very proof that 
shows that we are hurt or ill. Will a 
greater dependence on technology 
leave patients with little to no emotion? 
Imagine a conversation with a Siri-like 
artificial intelligence software instead 
of a nurse or doctor. It will ask about 
your background, your symptoms, 
your medical history, just like your 
doctor; however, with a monotone 
voice showcasing zero compassion and 
empathy to how you are feeling. There 
is also an off-chance of the following 
conversation to take place:

Artificial Intelligence: Hello. Please 

state your name, age and reason for the 
visit.

Me: My name is Sarang, I’m 19 and 

I’m feeling a bit under the weather 
today.

Artificial Intelligence: Ok Sirong, the 

weather is 75 degrees with sunshine all 
day.

Me: I want a real doctor.
These conversations may in fact 

be a privilege to many individuals, as 
another argument arises regarding 
the 
incorporation 
of 
technology, 

specifically for ordinary sick visits, 
which would certainly be very cost 
effective and efficient in developing 
countries. To those who lack access 
to proper healthcare, a quick, cheap 
machine could do wonders. Take for 
example the country of India. Home to 
over a billion people, it has about 0.725 
physicians per 1000 people according 
to the World Health Organization as 
of 2014. By calculating proportions, 
that gives the country around 725,000 
physicians in the country. Now 
compare this to the United States, which 
has 2.554 physicians per 1000 people. 
With a little over 320 million people, that 
would give the country approximately 
817
,000 physicians, almost 11 percent 

more than India. That’s about 80,000 
more physicians in a country that is a third 
in population size than India. It’s safe to say 
that technology would positively disrupt 
the healthcare system by improving the 
lives of millions in not only India, but also 
similarly developing countries.

While it makes complete sense to use 

technology to better mankind, a computer 
will never replace the art of building a 
doctor-patient relationship. Vinod Khosla 
stated in his article, “Technology will 
replace 80 percent of what doctors do.” 
Physicians will actually get more time to 
spend with their patients due to a detailed 
understanding of the medical results with 
the help of technology
. By replacing the 

time a doctor spends collecting data with a 
smarter, efficient machine, the doctor can 
talk to the patient. The best of both worlds, 
right? It’s a bit scary to think about the rise 
of technology
. With its help, revolutionary 

breakthroughs occur, yet there is always 
a sacrifice, whether it be money spent or 
human touch. There is no stopping this

Less than nine weeks before 

the start of the 2017-18 season, the 
Michigan football team has lost one 
of its top incoming freshmen.

Corey Malone-Hatcher, a for-

mer four-star defensive end from 
Saint Joseph’s High School (Mich.), 
announced on Twitter on Tuesday 
that he is retiring from football.

Malone-Hatcher, who enrolled 

early at the University in January, 
cited lingering issues from an Achil-
les injury he suffered in 2015 as the 
reason for the premature end to his 
playing career.

“After a surgical repair and thou-

sands of hours of rehab, my Achil-
les has not been recovering how 
it should be and is many months 
behind where it should be at this 
point in time,” Malone-Hatcher said 
via Twitter. “After discussions with 
the training staff and team doctor, it 
was collectively decided that I will 
take a medical disqualification.”

Malone-Hatcher said that he will 

remain on scholarship as a student 
at the University, in accordance 

with NCAA guidelines for medi-
cal exemptions, though he will not 
have the opportunity to suit up for 
the Wolverines.

Malone-Hatcher was one of 

19 of Michigan’s incoming fresh-
men ranked in the ESPN 300, with 
a ranking of 270. He was the top 
defensive end in the state of Michi-
gan this year, as well as the No. 19 
overall player at his position, also 
based off of the ESPN 300.

“I apologize to (Michigan coach 

Jim) Harbaugh and (defensive line 
coach Greg Mattison) as I know the 
expectation was for me to be able 
to come in and have an immediate 
impact. Nobody is more disappoint-
ed than myself,” Malone-Hatcher 
said. “I came to the University 
of Michigan to be turned into an 
excellent football player, excellent 
student, and most importantly, a 
Michigan Man.

“Sadly, my football career is over. 

I will continue in my pursuit the 
other two key points and let God 
take the wheel. Thank you to the 
Michigan fans who have support-
ed me throughout my high school 
career.”

Michigan women’s track and field introduces recruiting class

By JACOB SHAMES 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s track and field program 
announced its recruiting class for 
the 2018 season.

The 20-member class includes 

11 athletes from Michigan, and 
eight states in total are repre-
sented in the class. The group is 
heaviest on mid-distance athletes 
with 10, while 
also containing 
seven sprinters/
hurdlers.

“It’s exciting 

to see such a 
large class, such 
a balanced class 
and such a high-
quality class in 
terms of both 
academics 
and 

athletics,” said 
coach James Henry. “I believe 
many of these student-athletes 
should help us immediately head-
ing into the next season.”

While the vast majority of the 

class is made up of high-school-
ers, the Wolverines will add two 

transfers with Division I expe-
rience in sophomore Margaret 
Sliney and junior Audrey Belf.

Belf originally committed to 

Georgetown in 2015 after an illus-
trious high school career at Bir-
mingham Seaholm. As a senior, 
she won the 3,200 meter state 
championship, and won state 
cross 
country 
championships 

in 2013 and 2014. She currently 
ranks second all-time in Michi-

gan high school 
history in both 
the 3,200 and 
5,000 meters, as 
well as fifth in 
the 1,600. With 
the Hoyas, Belf 
finished 
third 

at the Big East 
Indoor 
Cham-

pionships 
her 

freshman year.

Sliney, 
a 

transfer from Bucknell, was a 
state champion in the 400 meters 
as a senior at Mary Institute 
and St. Louis Country Day High 
School in Missouri. She finished 
fifth at the Patriot League Cham-
pionships her freshman year in 

the indoor 500 meters, and will 
compete in sprints and mid-dis-
tance events with the Wolverines.

Including 
Belf 
and 
Sliney, 

Michigan’s 
recruiting 
class 

includes eight athletes who have 
won individual state champion-
ships in high school: mid-dis-
tance runners Mallory Barrett 
(Highland), Camille Davre (Mil-
waukee, Wisc.), Alice Hill (Ann 
Arbor) and Emma Lane (Men-
tor, Ohio). and sprinter Michaiah 
Thomas (Beverly Hills).

The Wolverines will also bring 

in nine athletes who have compet-
ed at the prestigious New Balance 
Nationals in track and field: Bar-
rett, Davre, Hill, Lane, sprinters 
Chloe Foster (Ann Arbor), Lauren 
Morgan (Washington, D.C.) and 
Jenna Reid (Middletown, N.J.), 
and mid-distance runners Alexis 
Munley (Clarkston) and Jacalyn 
Overdier (Ann Arbor).

Davre’s 
accomplishments 

headline Michigan’s incoming 
class of high schoolers. At White-
fish Bay High School, she won a 
whopping 10 state championships 
in track, and never finished below 
fourth place in cross country. As 

a senior, Davre swept the 800, 
1,600 and 3,200 meter races, and 
she is also a two-time New Bal-
ance National Champion in the 
800 meters with a personal best 
of 2:09.22.

Barrett, 

whose 
sis-

ter Rachel is a 
junior distance 
runner for the 
Wolverines, 
won the 2017 
state 
champi-

onship in the 
800 with a time 
of 2:11.06, and 
placed sixteenth at the New Bal-
ance Nationals shortly after. She 
also finished in the top-20 at the 
state cross country champion-
ships each of the last three sea-
sons.

Hill came in two places behind 

Barrett in the 800 at the state 
championships this year, after 
she won the indoor state cham-
pionship and earned a runner-up 
outdoor finish as a junior. Her 
personal best of 2:09.09 is 11th-
best in Michigan high school his-
tory.

Lane 
finished 
second 
and 

third at the Ohio outdoor state 
champions, and first and second 
in indoor competition her junior 
and senior seasons. She finished 

third or higher 
in every race as 
a senior.

Thomas, who 

won the Michi-
gan 
Division 

2 
champion-

ship in the 100-
meter 
hurdles 

as a sophomore, 
was 
also 
the 

USATF 
Michi-

gan Junior Olympics champion in 
the 400-meter hurdles.

“They’re all outstanding stu-

dents who fit our academic pro-
file, and I felt we did a good job 
of balancing the class, addressing 
some event-area needs and solidi-
fying some areas that are already 
strong,” said associate head coach 
Mike McGuire. “We have a good 
balance of people who we think 
are motivated to succeed here 
over the next few years both in 
the classroom and in competi-
tion.”

“Many of these 
student-athletes 
should help us 
immediately”

Walton, Irvin adjust to 
summer league competition

By JACOB SHAMES

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Unlike D.J. Wilson, his former 

teammate on the Michigan men’s 
basketball team, Derrick Walton 
Jr. wasn’t projected to be draft-
ed in the first round of the NBA 
Draft — or even in the second 
round, for that matter.

Despite a collegiate career 

steeped in accomplishments — 
Walton left Ann Arbor third in 
program history in games start-
ed, fourth all-time in assists, tied 
for fourth in three-pointers made 
and is the only Wolverine to score 
1,000 points, grab 500 rebounds 
and dish out 400 assists for his 
career — NBA teams shied away 
from him, due to his perceived 
lack of explosiveness and short 
stature, at only six feet tall.

But this by no means signaled 

the end of Walton’s NBA hopes. 
In recent years, similarly accom-
plished but undersized college 

point guards such as Indiana’s 
Yogi Ferrell and Penn State’s Tim 
Frazier have played their way 
onto NBA rosters and become 
key rotation pieces despite going 
undrafted.

Shortly after the draft, Walton 

accepted an invitation from the 
Orlando Magic to join their team 
at the Orlando Summer League. 
And If Walton’s performance 
in the summer league play has 
been any indication, he appears 
to have a legitimate chance to 
follow in the footsteps of Ferrell 
and Frazier.

Over the course of the Orlando 

Summer League, which began 
July 1 and ends July 6, Walton 
has averaged 10 points and 3.5 
assists in 20.8 minutes per game, 
while shooting 50 percent from 
behind the arc and 46.8 percent 
overall. With a 3.5 assist-to-turn-
over ratio, he has led the Magic 
to a plus-21 rating when he’s on 
the court, showing the same effi-

ciency he displayed at Michigan.

“We don’t get across the finish 

line without him,” said Orlan-
do summer league coach Chad 
Forcier in reference to Sunday’s 
game against the Miami Heat, 
in which Walton hit five of seven 
shots, including two 3-pointers, 
to help the Magic to an 81-68 win. 
“We had a stretch there in the 
second half where they cut into 
our lead and it was starting to get 
a little bit tight. He came up with 
a couple baskets and ended up 
controlling the tempo and giving 
our team a sense of calm and hit 
a couple timely shots. He’s been 
tremendous and he has a fan in 
me.”

Much of Forcier’s statement 

will likely sound familiar to Wol-
verines fans. Michigan’s offense 
ranked fourth in adjusted offen-
sive efficiency last season at 
122.3 points per 100 possessions, 
and it was Walton’s steady hand 
that was responsible for much of 
this success. He was a true floor 
general — a collected, intelligent 
presence with the ball in his 
hands who had a knack for big 
shots in key moments.

“I have a lot of confidence in 

my abilities and every time I get 
a chance to go and play, I just go 
and showcase it,” Walton told 
Vince Ellis of the Detroit Free 
Press 
Sunday. 

“Shooting 
has 

always been one 
of the things 
I’ve stood on 
and running a 
team and find-
ing guys. I’m 
just going out 
here and trying 
to do it at the 
highest level.”

The 
skills 

that Walton has shown so far in 
Summer League action — basket-
ball IQ and shooting ability — are 
the skills most likely to translate 
to that highest level. Dynamic 
athletes and high scorers such as 
Russell Westbrook, James Hard-
en and Kyrie Irving have increas-
ingly taken control of the NBA 
in recent years. And with this, 
finding players able to operate an 
offense at a high level when the 
starters rest is crucial.

And even though he may be 

lacking a few inches compared to 
most of his competition, Walton 
appears to fit that job description 
quite nicely.

“A guy of my size and stature 

is kind of a risk for most teams,” 
Walton said. “I’m firm in my abil-
ities and being able to show it is 
a relief. It’s easy for me because 

I go out and do 
what I do and 
the doubters I 
don’t pay any 
mind.”

Sunday’s 

game 
might 

have had some 
extra 
signifi-

cance for Wal-
ton, as Zak Irvin 
suited up on the 
other 
sideline 

for the Heat, scoring five points 
on two-of-four shooting.

But despite having played 

alongside Irvin for four years, 
there was nothing unusual to 
Walton about playing against his 
former teammate for a change — 
to Walton, it felt “like practice.”

“We compete all the time in 

our spare time, one-on-ones and 
things like that, but that’s my 
brother,” Walton said. “It was fun 
to see him out there.”

Added Irvin: “It was good to 

see him. It was definitely weird 
going up against him, us playing 
four years. He did give it to me a 
little bit. They did beat us. Hope-
fully, I get a chance to see him 
down the road to get the chance 
to even things up.”

Like Walton, Irvin was not 

among the 60 players selected in 
the NBA Draft, and accepted a 
Summer League invitation short-
ly after.

Irvin, however, hasn’t had the 

same level of success in Orlando 
as Walton. The Heat are 0-4 
in Summer League action, and 
Irvin has struggled to find his 
shot — he’s made just one of his 13 
three-point attempts so far and 
is averaging just 4.8 points per 
game.

But Irvin, who is tied for first 

all-time in games played for 
Michigan and third in three-
pointers made, will have more 
chances, as the Heat will begin 
play at the Las Vegas Summer 
League July 8. For now, Irvin 
just hopes to gain experience as 
he adjusts to professional basket-
ball.

“I’m enjoying the experience,” 

Irvin told the Free Press. “I’m 
trying to be a sponge and learn as 
much as I can out there and just 
getting better each game.”

“I’m just going 
out here and 

trying to do it at 
the highest level”
