HOUSING
'U' move-in
shortened in
on-campus
safety push
Freshmen seen as
vulnerable to alcohol
consumption trends
By SHOHAM GEVA
Managing News Editor
Freshmen and others students
living in the residence halls this
coming year will see several
changes to move-in this August
as part of a University initiative to
increase on-campus safety.
Most notably, move-in, which
has run over four days in the last
week of August in years past, will
take place only Aug 28 through 29
this year, with hours extended to
7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday and 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.
Groups that typically move in
early will instead be housed tem-
porarily in East Quad until the 26,
when they will move in to to their
permanent dorms, with the excep-
tion of Move-in Makers, who will
move immediately into their home
buildings. MIMs are a group of
students who volunteer to assist
with the move-in process.

Solar car team

Despite challenges,
Quantum carries
team for second year
of success
By MICHAEL SPAETH
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Solar Car Team
won its fifth consecutive national
title in the American Solar Chal-
lenge, continuing a legacy of first
place victories in the competition.
The eight-day, 1,700-mile race
began July 21 in Austin, Texas. The
23 teams of college students raced
across seven states before cross-
ing the finish line in Minneapolis,
Minn. on July 28. The race is held
every other year.
This year, the University's team
entered a three-wheeled car called
Quantum, which led the team to a
first-place finish in the 2012 Amer-
ican Solar Challenge and a third
place finish in the 2011 World Solar
Challenge in Australia.
However, the team had to over-

come several setbacks to win the
American Solar Challenge this
year.
During a practice run just days
before the race began, the car ran
over a pothole, causing a suspen-
sion component to break off of
the chassis. The team considered
whether they would have to use
an older car in the race, but engi-
neers at Roush, one of the team's
sponsors, helped the team quickly
repair the damage.
Engineering junior Pavan Naik,
project manager for the team, said
even though the break was a big
setback, it helped bring the team
closer together.
"In the end, through all these
failures, we were able to bond
together as a team and work
together to potentially win the
American Solar Challenge," Naik
said.
The team encountered another
challenge at the beginning of the
competition when the motor did
not function properly, causing the
team to drop from first place to
sixth place in the first few minutes

mated to campus, a problem she
added wasn't unique to the Uni-
versity.
"I think every college campus
is trying to find the sweet spot,"
she said. "What is the time nec-
essary for people to come in and
sort of get settled, and not have
so much time that that anxiety
of 'who should I talk to, 'where
should I go', doesn't sort of fes-
ter?"
When it comes to on-campus
safety, Desprez said while new
students at the University arrive
with many different relation-
ships to alcohol - some never
plan to drink, some already do
drink, and others have already
experienced damaging effects
from consumption - that anxi-
ety and vulnerability can lead to
heightened drinking incidents.
"One of the things that can
happen is if they're not careful,
they can believe the hype," she
said. " Beer commercials sort of
make it sound like beer is sort of
like lighter fluid, if you just add it
to it everything's hotter, better,
faster, quicker. And if you're not
careful, and you have increased
anxiety, you can believe that."
The University will monitor
several metrics, including the
number of people transported to
the hospital in emergency vehi-
cles, to determine the success of
the program.
"Do I think that condensing
move-in is going to solve all our
problems?" Desprez said. "No
way. Because the problems are
so different along the continu-
um. But could it help us reduce a
vulnerability spot for those early
few weeks? I sure hope so."
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said the
endeavor was an important one
for the University and Housing
was pleased to be able to support
it.
"Housing did not have any
particular motivations beyond
the larger University desire to
try a schedule that that would
promote, perhaps, safer behav-
ior and still provide a nice, open
welcome week for the incoming
students," he said.
In terms of logistics, Amir
Baghdadchi, University Hous-

ing's assistant communications
director, said for the first time
this year, Housing is offering
students time slots to sign up
for when they'll move in, in an
attempt to reduce potential con-
gestion.
"What this allows us to do is it
allows us to limit the number of
people who are coming, trying to
get in at the same time," he said.
"So we can ensure that Thursday,
at 9 a.m. at Markley, we know
that there are this many cars
coming so we'll have help there,
and spots for the cars to stop and
unload."
The University has implement-
ed several other programs over
the past few years to address the
issue of alcohol consumption on
campus with incoming students,
most notably an education pro-
gram freshmen take before they
arrive on campus, titled Alco-
holEdu, which was implemented
in 2010. University-sponsored
events such as a late-night trip
to Meijers with raffles and other
events, resident adviser-planned
activities and programs like
Artscapades also take place dur-
ing the break between move-in
and classes as sober alternatives.
Desprez said this year's
change in move-in was spurred
mostly by a new focus on four
areas of collective impact for
the University, including health
and wellness, championed by the
office of student life and E. Roys-
ter Harper, vice president for
student life.
In the coming year, she said
overall University's efforts
around alcohol consumption will
also undergo a change, shifting
more towards a message of holis-
tic wellness, as well as-an empha-
sis on collaboration between
groups like Greek Life, the Sexu-
al Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center, Wolverine Wellness
and Rec Sports on campus wide
issues surrounding alcohol use.
"A lot of times we talk to stu-
dents about what not to do, or
don't do this or it could hurt
you, and all that kind of stuff,"
Desprez said. "The other thing
that you'll hear coming out this
year is really sort of a wellness
frame. Not not what to do, don't
do, but these are all the ways that
you can achieve your full poten-
tial."

Managing Sports Editor
CHICAGO - After consecu-
tive letdown seasons, Brady
Hoke may be sitting squarely on
the hot seat entering his fourth
season in Ann Arbor.
But at Big Ten Media Days on
Monday, the Michigan football
coach deflected questions about
the pressure he will face this fall,
instead discussing the Wolver-
ines' off-the-field accolades.
"The only pressure is every
day preparing those guys for life
after football," he said. "Com-
petition, hard work and all that,
that's part of it. But socially and
academically, that's a big part of
it. So when you talk about that,
that's the only pressure as a
coach that I've ever felt - mak-
ing sure we're doing it for the
student-athletes."
Hoke added that all 69 of the
seniors he has coached at Michi-
gan graduated.
After winning the Sugar Bowl
and finishing with 11 wins in
Hoke's first year at Michigan, the
Wolverines went 8-5 in 2012 and
7-6 last season - including losses
to Michigan State and Ohio State.
This fall, the Wolverines
will play in what, on paper, is
a more difficult Big Ten East
division. The conference sched-
ule includes games on the road
against the Spartans and Buck-
eyes.
Because of the offseason Big
Ten realignment and the con-
ference's addition of Rutgers
and Maryland, Michigan will
visit Michigan State for a second
straight year.
"So what? Who cares?" Hoke
said. "You're going to play 12
football games. ... Embrace it. If
not, you're going to make excus-
es. And we rightly don't believe
in excuses."
Hoke on Peppers: 'Let's anoint
him when he does something'
Jabrill Peppers may be one
of Michigan's highest-rated
recruits in recent program his-
tory, but Hoke is doing his best to
temper expectations.
"He is anunbelievablyground-
ed young man," Hoke said of the
defensive back. "Are we excited

and glad that he's a Michigan
Wolverine? No doubt about it.
Are we excited about what we'll
be able to see in the next couple
of weeks? No doubt about it.
"Am I going to be up front
with him and shield him from
the pressure that he could put on
himself? No question."
The plan remains to play Pep-
pers at nickel, Hoke said. The
freshman is talented enough
to play a number of different
positions, including on offense,
and the coach said he'll enter-
tain anything that will help
the Wolverines win. But in the
meantime, Hoke will try to keep
Peppers level-headed by making
him focus on one position and
withholding the freshman from
the media when possible.
"Let's anoint him when he
does something, right?" Hoke
said. "I mean, let's see what he
can do."
Hoke not speculating on Ty
Isaac ruling
There is no timetable for the
NCAA's ruling on running back
Ty Isaac, Hoke said Monday.
Isaac, a former five-star
recruit, transferred to Michigan
in the offseason after his fresh-
man year at USC. The Wolver-
ines hope the NCAA will grant a
hardship waiver request, which
would allow the running back to
play immediately instead of sit-
ting out a year.
Isaac will report to and partic-

ipate in fall camp, which begins
Aug. 3.
"I'm not going to speculate on
it, because I have no clue," Hoke
said of the NCAA's ruling.
Isaac is from Shorewood,
Illinois, which is farther than
the 100-mile radius the NCAA
generally considers to grant a
hardship waiver when a player
transfers.
The running back rushed for
236 yards with two touchdowns
in 2013 and played in all 14 games
with the Trojans.
Funchess named to Players to
Watch list
As a freshman and sophomore,
wide receiver Devin Funchess
received acclaim for his 6-foot-
5 frame and soft hands, making
him an appealing target for his
quarterbacks.
Monday, that promise earned
him a spot on the Big Ten's
10-man Players to Watch list. He
is the only Wolverine to receive
the recognition this year.
Funchess, who was listed as a
tight end through last year, set a
Wolverines single-season record
at the position with 748 receiving
yards in 2013, though he lined
up out wide for the majority of
plays.
He was named the 2013 Big
Ten Kwalick-Clark Tight End
of the Year and was one of eight
finalists for the John Mackey
Award, given to the nation's most
outstanding tight end.

CITY
A2 increases push
for sustalnablity

By KELLY HALL
Daily Sports Writer
In Brighton, Michigan, a 2012
University alumna helps young
girls hone their softball skills
when she's not off winning the
World Cup of Softball. For former
Michigan softball player Amanda
Chidester, the future of the USA
Softball Women's National Team
is bright, and the game of softball
is a lifelong passion.
This summer is Chidester's
third straight with Team USA,
and she has learned a great deal
about being both a teacher and a
teammate since graduation.
In her spare time, she also
holds local softball clinics in her
hometown of Allen Park, Michi-
gan, but right now, she's with the
national team. Team USA won the
World Cup of Softball on July 13 in
Irvine, California, but is currently
preparing for the most important
competition of the summer -
the World Championships in the
Netherlands starting Aug. 15.
Though Chidester was never
able to play for the U. S. in the
Olympics (the International
Olympic Committee cut baseball
and softball from the Games in
2012), she believes that she'll be
playing in the 2020 Olympics.
And who knows? Maybe some
of her students will be as well.
Chidester spoke with the Daily
recently to discuss her time with
Team USA, her outlook on the
future of softball and the con-
stant support she receives from
the Michigan softball community
and coaches.
The Michigan Daily: What
has changed for you since you

Amanda Chidester was a two-time All-American at Michigan and is now in her third summer of playing for Team USA.

were first on Team USA in 2012?
Amanda Chidester: I was out
of college so I, myself, changed
a lot. For me, I love softball, so I
decided to continue with soft-
ball. Being a part of representing
Team USA was huge, but coming
from the University of Michigan
helped me too. All of the opportu-
nities I was given through Team
USA and the University of Michi-
gan have been awesome.
TMD: Have any of Michigan
softball coach Carol Hutchins'
mantras really stuck with you and
helped you during your time with
Team USA?
AC: Oh yeah, there are so
many. "Leave the place better
than you found it" is a huge one

for me. She says that one a lot, and
everywhere I go, I want to leave
a mark and be an important par

than your best and give it you:
all. One hundred percent effort
That's something I carry with
me with my work, with whatevet
I'm doing, and with dealing with
people. It goes a long way.
TMD: How often do you get
to talk to Coach Hutchins about
your game and how has your rela-
tionship with her developed over
the years?
AC: I was able to be an assistant
after graduation and saw a whole
different side, the coaching side
of the game with (Hutchins) and

saw behind the scenes. There's
so much that goes into it that we
t don't even know about as players.
Going through that whole year
s was pretty awesome.
r Last year, I was able to go to
games and stuff, butI was kind of
on my own. I didn't get a chance
r to see (Hutchins) as much as I
would've liked to, but when I did,
we always had great talks. She
t was right there to congratulate
t me when I made the USA team
again. I was able to go in and talk
with her a little bit on one of my
breaks. She's always there for me
t - for all of us - which is awe-
some, absolutely awesome. She
always says, "You're a Wolverine
forever." That's what makes her
so great.
TMD: How has the culture of
Michigan softball impacted your
career?
AC: Those people that were
around me during my four years
in college have continued to sup-
port me through my time with
USA. There's a big family that
continues to stick around and
when I go back and watch a game,
everyone's there to ask me how
I'm doing and to tell me they miss
me. It's just a great, great family
with everybody. To go back and
be a part of that family is pretty
awesome.
TMD: You and your team-
mates posted a 7-0 record during
the World Cup of Softball Cham-
pionships. You had five RBI and

batted .385. How were you feeling
throughout the tournament and
what was the energy like?
AC: It was good. The whole
team had great energy the whole
time. The team is just so deep.
Any of the 17 players could be
on that field at any point in time,
which is pretty awesome. The last
couple of years, we didn't have
that. This year, the event is a lot
deeper, and I think that's great.
We just feed off of each other.
TMD: What have you and your
teammates been focusing on as
the World Championships get
closer?
AC: This year there are some
returners, but there are also some
new players, so just growing
together and continuing to get
to know each other more, work-
ing together more and just grow-
ing as a team. I think that will be
our biggest thing, just continuing
to get that experience with each
other. We're not used to playing
with each other all the time so
it's a growing process for us, and I
think we've comea long way. USA
has given us the opportunity to
play a lot of different teams and
continue to grow.
TMD: What do you see your-
self doing after the World Cham-
pionships this year?
AC: I work in a facility in Brigh-
ton so I'll be back there again and
training little girls to become
softball players and do the best
they can. I'll be doing camps with.
some of my USA teammates as
well.
TMD: Though your dreams
of playing Olympic softball were
stolen from you when the IOC
decided to get rid of softball and
baseball, you've still been able to
travel the world with Team USA.
What's the message you send to
the girls at your softball clinics
that just love to play the game?
AC: We're fighting to get it
back. In my mind, it's coming
back in 2020 and I'm going to play
in 2020. While giving lessons and
doing camps, we just tell these
girls that we're fighting like heck
to give you guys the opportunity
to do this, but just because it's not
an Olympic sport doesn't mean
that they can't have their passion

after that. There are still oppor-
tunities, but it's everyone's dream
to play in the Olympics. We're
going to do everything we can to
get it back.

City moves to next
phase of three-
year rental energy
efficiency project
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
This summer and fallAnnArbor
is stepping up its sustainability
efforts.
City officials have recently
commenced a survey designed to
improve energy efficiency among
rental properties, many of which
students hold leases to, over the
course of the next few years. The
effort is part of a three-year project
spurred by the city's receipt of
a grant in the beginning of 2012
with the goal to increase energy
efficiency in existing rental houses.
The project places the city
in a partnership with 14 other
cities, led by Bloomington, Ind.
across the country known as Rent
Rocket. Rent Rocket's goal is to
crowdsource energy data to create
more efficient housing.
Through the survey, Ann Arbor
renters are being encouraged to
share their energy bills on the city's
website. Based on the costs and
energy usage in accordance with
the property size, project members
will then gauge the efficiency of
rental properties.
Jamie Kidwell, an Ann Arbor
sustainability associate, said one
of the hurdles in the city's research
is gaining an accurate overview of
the city's rental properties, which
is why the city is asking those
respondingto the survey to directly
upload their electricity bills from
DTE Energy.
"The accuracy of getting data on
utilities through a simple survey
is very difficult, and that's one of
the reasons we're trying to do the
direct upload," Kidwell said. "That

way we will at least have a lot of
historical data that we know is
accurate."
Kidwell said the survey has
yielded about 30 responses in the
past month, with reported costs
that were "all across the board".
While the survey officially was
opened in late June, there will be
another period in which renters
can respond to the survey early
this fall, through September and
October.
Kidwell noted that due to many
students currently being away from
the city for the summer, the data
that has been collected so far has
been scant, but they hope to get at
least over 100 responses by the end
of the fall round of data collection.
"It's a tough time of the year
to gather data given that a large
portion of our renters are student
renters," she said.
However, she said the team
will publicize the project heavily
this fall, and will use avenues
such as the Earthfest, postering
and making announcements in
University classes, with the hope of
getting more input from students.
The project's goal is to
result in both energy-efficient
improvements to existing
properties as well as an expansion
of education for renters within the
city about the efficiency ratings of
certain properties.
Kidwell said one of the ways
of educating renters, if feasible,
will be in the form of a mobile
application and website that will
essentially provide potential
renters with information on
the energy efficiency of rental
properties.
"If we could plot the energy
efficiency on a map when you're
looking for your rental housing,
you could see the historical energy
use, that might lead you to pick
a more energy efficient house,"
Kidwell said.

about $5,886 on campaign con-
sulting, $1,288 on Facebook and
Google promotions, and thousands
on local advertising, including
$2,414 for advertising from MLive
and other mediagroups.
"That was intentional, we decid-
ed at the get-go that we were going
to fund this about 50%," Petersen
said. "We didn't hirea professional
staff to work day by day like other
candidates, we relied on a small
group of volunteers who work full
time. It's been alot of time focused
on the messaging. My time is more
important, rather than doing the
fundraising, spent with the vot-
ers."
Briere raised about $26,680,
$1,000 of which was from a fam-
ily member, and the rest of which
was from various property com-
panies, University affiliates from
LSA and other community mem-
bers. Notable donors include Sava
Lelcaj, owner of local restaurants
Sava's and Aventura and Dennis
Dahlmann, owner of Dahlmann
Properties in Ann Arbor.
Kunselman raised $7,474, most
of which was from fellow city
council members and other local
community donors.
"You have candidates that are
raising lots of money from the

wealthy, and I think it is hypo-
critical for someone to raise a lot
of money for a campaign to win an
election while promising to pro-
vide for government subsidies and
affordable housing, it just doesn't
add up," he said of the reports.
Relationship withthe
University
Though the August primaries
occur a few weeks before most
students return to campus, and
typically, student votes in the pri-
maries are low, along with finances
the University's relationship with
the city has also been a major
theme leading up to it.
Candidates are quick to admit
the importance of a positive rela-
tionship between the University's
president and Ann Arbor's next
mayor, but University representa-
tive Rick Fitzgerald said the future
for University and city relations
is still up in the air, especially as
President Schlissel enters the first
year of his presidency.
"I don't anticipate a dramatic
shift, but at this point, he is still
getting to know the campus and
the Ann Arbor community, and
Ann Arbor will have a new mayor,
so we will have to wait and see
exactly how that takes shape,"
Fitzgerald said.
When it comes to the city's posi-

of the race. However, by the time
they reached the first checkpoint,
they were back in first place and
held the lead for the remainder of
the race.
"It's not hard to build a very
aerodynamic and very efficient
solar car," he said. "It's very hard
to build a very successful team.
And thankfully, we've had 25
years of experience building a very
successful team, and I think that's
what sets us apart from any of our
competition in the United States
and in the world."
Business junior Mikhail Gore-
lik, a member of the team's busi-
ness division, said organization,
efficiency and speed also set the
team apart from its competitors.
"Some of the other teams,
they would be coming out and
they would be walking towards
their array and they might not be
rushing as much, whereas I've
had some people tell me that you
guys ran out to that car so fast, I
thought it was on fire," he said.

"So it was just everybody knowing
that as soon as the car stops here,
my job is to sprint to it and do this,
and just having that ready to go
was, I think, what gave us a large
advantage on the competition."
Engineering senior Ian Larson,
who serves as the team's crew
chief, said this victory is particu-
larly exciting because the team
was able to overcome its ninth
place finish in the 2013 World

Solar Challenge and multiple set-
backs before and during this year's
race.
"That, I think, showed to every-
one, both at home and abroad, that
the University of Michigan Solar
Car Team is going to be back in
2015 and we're going to be doing
everything we can to finally win
the World Solar Challenge," Lar-
son said.

tion,land ownership is the name of
the game, an issue that has often
left theUniversityand cityatoppo-
sites with each other on major pur-
chases. Whenever the University
purchases a property, itis removed
from the city's tax rolls.
Though all of the Democratic
candidates have some history
with the University, be it Taylor's
four degrees from the University
or Kunselman's ten years as the
University's Environmental Con-
servation Liaison, none see exactly
eye-to-eye or necessarily have a
clear solution when it comes to dif-
fusing University-city tensions.
In January, Taylor said the pos-
sibility of requesting a payment in
lieu of taxes from the University
was both appropriate and reason-
able, but all of the candidates for
mayor seem to be singing the same
tune on the possibility of voluntary
payments to the city.
"As much as I would like a pay-
ment in lieu of taxes, no, that is not
something I would bring to the
table at this point," Taylor said.
Petersen said that any conversa-
tion of a voluntary payment from
the University to the city would
negatively affect the city's rela-
tionship with the University.

Vote Petersen for Democratic Mayoral Primary
The editorial board endorses Sally Petersen due to her vocal support about improving relations with the University
The Ann Arbor Democratic Primary election for the Democratic mayoral candidate will be held Tuesday,
Aug. 5. Currently, there are four candidates running for the Democratic spot on November's ballot:
Councilmembers Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1), Sally Hart Petersen (D-Ward 2), Christopher Taylor (D-Ward
3) and Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward 3). The winner of next week's primary will face independent candidate
Bryan Kelly Nov. 4 in the election for city mayor, where a democratic candidate - John Hieftje - has won
the election for the past seven terms. While many University students pay little attention to city politics, the
upcoming mayoral election is important for everyone residing in Ann Arbor whether they live here permanently
or temporarily, like many students.

et'sbe honest: The Inter-
national Champions Cup
match between Real
Madrid and Manchester United
at Michigan
Stadium is a
money grab
for the Ath-
letic Depart-
ment, and
it's a way for r
Michigan to
keep build-
ing the brand ALEJANDRO
that Dave ZUNIGA
Brandon so
dearly cher-
ishes.
On Saturday, the world's largest
collegiate stadium will welcome
legends of the world's most
popular sport. The game will be
showcased on national television.
It will likelybreak an attendance
record for a United States-based
soccer match.
It's futbol, not football, and it's
certainly not part of any long-
standing Michigan tradition.
From the Athletic Department's
standpoint, it's an event whose
merit can be justified almost
entirely in economic gain.
The International Champions
Cup joins rising seat donation
requirements, alternate uniforms,
and weddings and proms at the
Big House as additional means for
profit. And for that reason, it has
been subject to criticism.
But for those willing to dive
into the history books, the event
- or any that might follow - isn't
so unusual. Fielding Yost, the
mastermind behind Michigan
Stadium, built the venue for the
enthusiasm it could bring, but also
the financial impact it would have
on the University.
Profit-based decisions are
nothing new.
How's this for breaking
tradition? In 1929, 1930 and 1931,
Yost approved doubleheaders at
the Big House to boost revenue.
Before Michigan Stadium
opened in 1927, the Wolverines
competed at Ferry Field. Despite
regular bumps in capacity,
increasing demand forced the
University to turn away thousands
of hopeful spectators, leading The
Michigan Alumnus, the Alumni
Association newsletter to wonder
about a replacement.

"We shall soon needa stadium
like the one at Harvard," they
wrote in a 1905 editorial.
After Yost became Athletic
Director in 1921, he shared plans
for a successor to Ferry Field that
could act as the permanenthome
of Michigan football. He imagined
that the Athletic Department
would profit and that revenue
would help create facilities for all
University students.
In a 1922 issue of The Michigan
Alumnus, Yost wrote that "good
years financially have put
athletics on a sound basis" for
new stadiums elsewhere, and
the editors of the publication
were enthused about the Athletic
Director's vision.
"We believe in the new
University stadium," they wrote..
"They are designed, in fact, to pay
for themselves."
But the Board of Regents
disagreed and rejected Yost's idea.
A committee appointed by
interim President Alfred H. Lloyd
in 1925 detailed whyUniversity
administrators were ambivalent
about upgrading the football
facilities. Unlike Yost, who
thought that athletics taught
valuable lessons in character, the
committee warned that sports
distracted from academics.
"Intercollegiate athletics,
notably football, have been so
largely developed, that other
interests - athletic as well as
scholarly - have fallen behind,"
they detailed in the "Report on
University Athletics" in January
1926. "Intercollegiate athletics
appear to have grown out of all
proportion to the importance of
the purposes which they serve."
But the five-man committee
agreed that Ferry Field was
unsatisfactory and unsafe, and
urged the commencement of a
new stadium.
Yost had his approval but
needed funding, so he headed
Michigan's original seat
donation program. In exchange
for purchasing a $500 bond at
3-percent interest, interested
alumni and residents of the state
could buy season ticketsbetween
the 30-yard lines.
After significant prodding,
enough people invested, and in
1927, Michigan Stadium hosted
its first game. The Wolverines

finished 3-2 in the Big Ten that
year, but Yost boasted publicly
about the earnings.
"So far as I can see the dollars
of football are providing funds
for plant and equipment to all
the non-football competitive
teams ... and also are providing
opportunity for all members of
the student body," he wrote in
a commentary titled "Football
Profits Defended" tothe
Associated Press on Dec. 9,1927.
"If this is commercialism in sport
- if this is high finance in football
- I am glad to be numbered
among those who have some part
in its development"
Yost envisioned Michigan
Stadium as a necessary solution
to a growing sport, but he also
understood it asa money-making
tool.
In 1930, he implemented
in Michigan Stadium the first
electronic scoreboard used to
keep official time at football
games. In the late 1960s, then-
Athletic Director Don Canham
began slappingthe block 'M' on
merchandise in a successful effort
to expand Michigan's brand. In
2011, the Big House toppled an
attendance record, hosting its first
official night game.
And in 2014, it will welcome
Real Madrid and Manchester
United during the International
Champions Cup.
Yost knew Michigan football
and Michigan Stadium would sell,
and he used the resulting profits
to his advantage. His vision
resulted in the Intramural Sports
Building (opened in 1928) and the
Michigan Golf Course (1931).
More than 50 years later, the
Athletic Department will again
maximize revenue from Yost's
Big House, this time leveraging
International Champions Cup
earnings to provide academic
scholarships for students and
fund improvements to the
Wolverines' soccer facilities.
The rest will help the Athletic
Department record a 13th
consecutive year with a surplus.
That's commercialism in sport,
and Yost would be proud to have
made his contribution.

Each of the four Democratic
Primary candidates have served
on the Ann Arbor City Council,
ranging from two to seven years.
Similarly, current mayor John
Hieftje supports each of the
candidates to varying degrees.
Sabra Briere has been active in
the Ann Arbor community for more
than thirty years and has served on
City Council since 2007. Briere's
platform emphasizes general
improvements to the city. She also
supports increased inclusivity, and
creating stronger transparency
between residents and city
officials. Incorporating inclusivity
isn't a surprise for Briere, a
candidate well known for listening
to residents' issues within the city.
While open communication is
desirable, her communication skills
haven't efficiently translated into

fruitful solutions to issues. Briere
hasn't provided tangible solutions
for improving unity between
the University and the city.
Furthermore, The Michigan Daily
noted in 2009 that her housing
viewpoints differ from the notion
that students need more affordable
housing. While Briere stresses her
listening skills, she hasn't always
listened to student needs.
Stephen Kunselman has been
a big proponent for off-campus
student housing by promoting
increased options and decreased
costs. He also wants increased
public safety by adding more police
officers to the Ann Arbor Police
Department. Being an Ann Arbor
native and a University alumni,
he has a strong understanding of
both the city and the University.
However. Kunselman has stated

that he sees no distinction between
students and Ann Arbor residents.
While this statement is likely
an effort to reflect neutrality, it
instead indicates that Kunselman
fails to see the difference between
students and residents, despite
the reality that both groups have
different needs.
Christopher Taylor has
provided consistency in increasing
transportation for all city residents
by being the only candidate to give
support for the expansion of Ann
Arbor Transit Authority bus lines.
He has been a strong advocate for
creatingmethods to keep University
graduates living and working in
Ann Arbor. Taylor, along with
Peterson, believes reaching out to
the student population about their
needs falls on the responsibility
of the city rather than students.

Unfortunately, Taylor, like Briere,
has no solid plan for improving
relations between the Ann Arbor
and the University.
Graduating with a Harvard
business degree, Sally Hart
Petersen emphasizes solutions to
problems by viewing them with an
economic frame. She's emphasized
more affordable housing, and one of
her biggest concerns is improving
the city's revenue problem. She's
also opposed policies hurting
the University, like a University
payment outside of taxation bounds.
Instead, Petersen emphasizes
creating more open communication
between the University and the
city to discuss important issues.
While Petersen's economic focus is
oftentimes beneficial, prioritizing
the city's finances can sometimes
be cause for concern. She voted

against fossil fuel divestment due
to its negative influence on citizen's
pensions, suggesting the city invest
in green energy instead. While
this vote reaps economic benefits,
it subsequently brings to light
other concerns. Petersen also has
the least experience out of all the
candidates, finishing her second
term on City Council in November,
but, if elected, will have twice the
experience of current mayor John
Hieftje when he was elected.
This year, The Michigan Daily's
editorial board endorses SALLY
HART PETERSEN for the
Ann Arbor Mayoral Democratic
Primary. Given the intricate
balance between the University
and the city, Petersen prioritizing
Ann Arbor's finances proves an
effective bridge to unify both forces
acting on the town.

incomprehensibly abstruse, as on
"#CAKE." His similes on "Solemn
Swears" are largely nonsensical,
and his vocals throughout the
album are often accompanied by
so much echo and reverb that they
become unintelligible.
But this isn't an album to be
torn apart track by track; more
than any other LP I've heard this
year, Lese Majesty is a cohesive
sonic unit that needs to be con-
sidered in its entirety to be fully
appreciated.
Each of the album's seven suites
features repeated elements -
like the airy, bittersweet chords
on 'Touch & Agree' or the water
droplets sprinkled throughout
'Murkings on the Oxblood Stair-
way' - that give each section
its own unique character while
flowing logically and organically
into the next. A sense of brood-
ing, throbbing darkness builds
across the whole album as Butler
combines hazy Old Testament
imagery with futuristic axioms,
making the whole project seem
like the soundtrack to a space-age
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Perhaps the most innovative
aspect of Lese Majesty, however,
is its systematic subversion of the
egocentrism of modern Hip Hop.
In a recent interview with NPR,
Butler described the album as a
"sonic attack on the 'me-mania'
that's sweeping over our culture
of late," and in that vein he con-
sistently avoids references to
himself. The only time he says
"Ishmael" is in a literary allusion
to "Moby Dick," and, like that
enigmatic narrator, Butler occa-
sionally fades from the picture
entirely. He deliberately makes
his lyrics unintelligible by use of
heavy reverb and delay while let-
ting the occasional phrase slip
through for the listener to inter-
pret for him or herself.
Like Melville's white whale,
then, Lese Majesty is an open text
that reflects the mania of its read-
er. It's an opportunity to ponder
the infinite, to look into the abyss
and see what's staring back. And,
like Melville's novel, Lese Maj-
esty is a masterpiece ahead of its
time. Just as he did as a member
of Digable Planets, Butler and his
collaborators have boldly entered
uncharted waters in Hip Hop,
both on a sonic and philosophical
level, and there's no one I'd rather
have at the helm.

Learning to say 'bye'

y standard answer for
telling people how
this summer went
has become,
"It's just as
important to
learn what
you don't like
as learning
what you do
like." Don't
get me wrong,
I've certainly HARLEEN
had positive KAUR
experiences
in D.C. My
internship on the Hill has given
me more insights into federal work
than I could have imagined. I met
new and wonderful people, and I
learned how to brave the 80 to 90
percent humidity and 90 degree
weather while walking 40 minutes
to work in business professional
attire. All incredibly important in
my opinion.
However, it still left something
to be desired. Last summer, I had
an internship and living experience
that would be my dream to recreate
as my post-graduation plans. I
loved every second of it and was
incredibly disappointed when the
last day finally came, sending me
away from New York and back
to Ann Arbor. This year, with a
countdown going since the day I
got here, I worry that I may have
blocked my own ability to have a
good time with my excitement for
senior year and things to come.
But as I prepare to leave D.C. and
return to Ann Arbor for the fourth,
and final, time, I do know that this
summer has been an important one.
Leaving junior year, I felt burnt
out, overwhelmed and uncertain.
I knew that I had bitten off way
more thanI could chew. So much so
that my boss told me that if I didn't
return in the fall with a significant
decrease in my level of involvement
in extracurricular activities, we
would have to have a more serious
conversation about it. I spent this
summer reflecting, making lists,
choosing and unchoosing. How
does one decide which love is
greater than another? With one or
two exceptions, I have never quit
something before out of choice.
Even in high school, I only really
"quit" because I graduated. In
college, it had happened because of
inevitable conflicts or things out of
my control. But to willingly leave
an extra-curricular? I was baffled.
I've never really liked to say that
I'm "moving on to bigger and better
things." In the back of my mind, it

always felt like I was saying that
the things I was leaving were just
stepping stones, nothing more. For
me, all my involvements are more
like a journey than a staircase.
I may come back to something,
I may realize how much I enjoy
an activity and find another way
to pursue it or I could learn that
I don't like something at all.
However, regardless of which
result it is, each is just as valuable
of a learning experience. No matter
what it may be, each job, internship,
extracurricular or class that I have
pursued has made me who I am and
has shaped my aspirations in life.
Some have made things more clear
while others have confused me
more than I was before I started.
And yet, each is valuable. Each is
significant.
However, it's still important to
know when to let go. Just because
something is good for you, doesn't
mean that it always will be, or that
it will be the best possible option
at that time. In part, that's why
I've decided that this will be my
last article for The Daily. Though
I've loved the conversations I've
been able to have and the people
I've been able to meet because
of my time as a columnist, I also
recognize that my intentions I had
when I joined have been fulfilled.
Though journalistic writing may
certainly be something I return
to later in life, I have realized my
need to spend more time on other
ventures and pursue those avenues,
as well, to see how fruitful they
may be.
As senior year approaches
(quicker than I'd like), I'm hoping
that most of my goodbyes will
actually be see-you-soons, and
though it will be hard to not live
down the hall from my closest
friends or be able to see familiar
faces in the dining hall, in lecture,
or on the Diag, I know that the
friends I made here will be some for
the ages. My four years at Michigan
will always be some of my greatest,
but I know that they will also lead
me to new and great adventures for
the restofmylife. Sayinggoodbye is
hard, but saying hello to something
else can make it alittle easier.In the
end, I know I'm not replacing my
experiences and relationships that
I made in Ann Arbor, but actually
adding to them.
And so, for today goodbye, for
tomorrow good luck and forever go
blue!

no interest in. This is a scenario since my last semi-meaningful

romantic relationship, one that
ended too quickly, with too
little explanation and too much
scathing pain. The year prior,
I had experienced crushing
heartbreak from girl I loved and
considered my best friend. Two
years earlier, I began the worst
grief of my life when my father
died - grief that is still largely
unsettled.
As I've spent my college
years pushing these emotional
burdens aside, trying to use
them to fuel my work ethic and
commitment to "meaningful"
endeavors, I've isolated myself
from one of the only ways to cure
my pain: other people.
While I've made friends over
the past year and seen girls here
and there, I've closed myself off
almost completely at any signs
of love - romantic or platonic. I
fear getting hurt again so much
that I refuse to ever create a
situation where hurt is even
possible for me. I've abandoned
pursuing potential relationships
and alienated friends, generating
excuses to avoid the dangers of
attachment.
It all backfired.
Instead of a dignified
and solitary commitment to
"meaningful" things, I've
become completely empty,
numbing myself with politics
and anger. I'm constantly sad,
troubled to remember the last
day where I felt truly happy.
As I've thrown myself into
my classes this summer, I've
watched the last slivers of my
humanity start to disappear,
becoming increasingly isolated,
unhappy and, now, barely able to
write.
As Joan Didion once said, "The
element of discovery takes place,
in nonfiction, not during the
writing but duringthe research."
The only research, and hence the
only discovery, I have done as of
late is in loneliness.
By my first column in the fall,
I hope for that to change.

Indie's most
influential
tastemakers put on
Chicago bash
By JOHN LYNCH
MgnagingArts Editor
Before I heard any band play
at Pitchfork Music Festival 2014,
I took one lap around Chicago's
Union Park and already knew that
I was in for a weekend of bizarre
sights, sounds and tastes.
Lining the boundaries of the
festival grounds were countless
food options - stands giving out
free Twinkies, next to stands
giving out free goat milk ice
cream bars, next to stands selling
Philly Cheesesteaks for nine dol-
lars. There were grown men and
women walking around holding
pink tickets (Pitchfork's currency
for alcoholic beverages), looking
like children at the prize coun-
ter of a Chuck-E-Cheese. There

Bittersweet final performance

was a typewriter next to a board
called Missed Connections, where
romantic festival-goers had begun
to advertise their anonymous
affection for one another, typing
up and posting sweet messages
such as "dear friend, i am gypsy
that likes to get wild in the back of
the church van. now listen close,
I have euros. i will trade them for
a good roll in the hay. xoxo, sonia
the lioness."
And, of course, there was the
music and everything that came
with it: 3 stages, 43 acts, one jam-
packed Union Park and countless
moments of crowd-induced claus-
trophobia.
Saturday began with a perfor-
mance from Twin Peaks, a young
Chicago band whose lead singer
was wheelchair-bound with a
cast on his leg and whose music
sounded like a distant cousin of
Elvis Costello circa My Aim Is
True. Halfway through the set,
the band's bassist acknowledged
a fan-made sign that said "Thank
You, BasedGod" - marking the
first of many appearances by the

physically absent, yet somehow
ever-present Lil B.
Later, Pusha T showed up 35
minutes late to his set, of course
prompting the crowd to chant
"We want BasedGod" repeatedly
while they waited. Unfazed, Pusha
came on stage and ran through a
15 minute-long slew of featured
verses from Kanye West songs
and tracks from My Name Is My
Name, boasting "Greatest rapper
alive, I know who's living!" and
signingoffby shouting"BasedGod
my dick!"
I saw St. Vincent do her best
impression of an android rock star
before leaving early to check out
FKA Twigs, a rising enigmatic
R&B star, who slithered around
the stage and told the crowd, "I
didn't go to university, so I'm in
the university of life."
The most notable performances
of the day, however, were Detroit
rapper Danny Brown, who
showed up on time and really got
the crowd moving (re: moshing)
with energetic tracks from his
most recent album, "Old," and

Neutral Milk Hotel. Jeff Mag-
num's still-crisp and powerful
voice led the band as they closed
off the night by playing almost all
of "In The Aeroplane Over The
Sea," and since they had requested
that there be no recording of any
kind during the set, the jumbo-
trons next to the stage were black
and all I could see was a mostly
bearded band that looked eerily
like the cast of Duck Dynasty, but
nonetheless, I was quite content.
On Sunday, I realized that I
could use my press pass to get into
the pit for the first three songs of
each act, so I used this to my advan-
tage and got close-up to Deafheav-
en, a shoe-gazey metal band that
shifted between subtle instrumen-
tal lulls and screaming, thundering
breakdowns from their seemingly
demonic lead singer.
The highlight of the day, and
probably the festival, for me was
Earl Sweatshirt, who had previ-
ously stated that he was canceling
all of his summer festivals due to
mental health reasons, but none-
theless showed up and provided

Pitchfork with some much needed
comic relief. In addition to being
perhaps the best performing rap-
per at the festival, he was also the
most entertaining. Earl came out
to Journey's "Don't Stop Believ-
ing," attempted to get a reaction
out of a dude with a "dress shirt
and aviators" that he insisted on
calling "Brent," and questioned
the crowd about whether or not
Chicago had a weird historic meat
district.
The festival closed out with
Kendrick Lamar, who I have now
seen four times and continue to be
incredibly disappointed by. His
live band was fantastic, but he still
struggled to command the crowd,
forcing us to repeat the words of
his choruses until every last per-
son became disinterested. I had
tried to get into the pit again for
the first three songs and somehow
got escorted to the area behind
the stage, where I ran into Young
Chop, a famous Chicago produc-
er, and then proceeded to cap my
weekend at Pitchfork off with a
celebratory free Twinkie.

'A Most Wanted
Man' features
everything that made
Hoffman great
By AKSHAY SETH
ManagingArts Editor
The worst part about sitting
through Philip Seymour Hoff-
man's last major performance is
how quickly one
realizes that the
genius actor was
at the peak of his AMost
career in those
final months Wanted
leading up to his Man
death. Playing
aging German Liusgate
spymaster Gun- State Theatre,
ther Bachmann, Raveand
he tackles the Quality16
role with the
familiar, grim
insight we've come to expect.
He stares off in pensive thought.
He drags away on cigarette after
cigarette, mutters a terse "good"
to convey any sense of approval,
and when the time finally comes,
uses that bulking frame to prop
up those moments of outraged
physicality - a physicality which
so often transforms his portray-
als into such memorable tests of
strength.
What's uniquely apparent from

Anton Corbijn's "A Most Wanted
Man" is the way it can be viewed
as a darker carbon copy of the
kind of characters Hoffman has
been bringing to life his entire
career. Gunther Bachmann is
a tortured man. Partly because
of the horrors he has witnessed
in his tenure astan intelligence
officer in the post-9/11 West, but
mostly because he's acutely aware
he represents a fading way of
doing business, an idealism that's
no longer permissible in a world
of suicide bombers and electronic
espionage. So it becomes clear
minutes after Isaa Karpov, a half-
Russian, half-Chechen Muslim
with past ties to terrorist organi-
zations, shows up on the streets of
urban Hamburg that things won't
end well for anyone involved.
But Bachmann doesn't turn
away. Karpov, the only son of
a dead Russian crime lord, has
arrived in Germany to claim a 10
million Euro inheritance left in
his name. To get here, he's had
to escape Turkish and then Rus-
sian prisons, both places where
he faced brutal torture for his
involvement with extremist reli-
gious sects, the specific natures
of which are left unexplained.
The first people he reaches out
to are an innocent family living
in a quiet Muslim neighborhood
that in turn makes further con-
tact with a young lawyer (Rachel
McAdams, "Sherlock Holmes")
who then tries to help Karpov

secure his wealth with the help
of a shady banker (Willem Dafoe,
"Out of the Furnace").
Here, Bachmann steps in
with his team of black ops offi-
cers tasked with singling out and
eliminating possible threats akin
to Mohammed Atta, an al-Qaida
affiliate who orchestrated the 9/il
attacks from the safety of Ham-
burg. The veteran German spy
eventually hopes to use Karpov's
wealth to draw out a terrorist
financing cell headed by an out-
wardly moderate Muslim intel-
lectual, though his team's efforts
are closely monitored a group of
American officials. This melange
of departmental politics and its
diluted arguments about jurisdic-
tion serve to inflate the ultimate
question we're meant to consider:
is all the planning, chasing Cor-
bijn uses to tighten his thriller
at all significant in the grander
scheme of things? Are Bach-
mann's labored efforts, further
emphasized through Hoffman's
labored, brooding performance,
at all relevant?
As Bachmann iterates in a cru-
cial scene, it is all, at the end of
the day "to make the world a safer
place. Whatever that takes." The
real answer, of course, is much
simpler. The Americans always
win. In the film's powerhouse
final act, Hoffman again uses
those that outraged physical-
ity to convey helpless rage. It's an
empty, hollow scream of anger

more human than the trails of icy
formalism flowing through the
rest of the movie, and above all, a
reminder why the late actor will
always be remembered as a man
who only opted for roles which
pushed him to explore new depths
through the darkest of characters.
Like many of the other people
Hoffman brought to life, Gunther
Bachmann's only real flaw is that
he's naive enough to think the
world is willing to accommodate
his desires. In "Capote" and "Boo-

gie Nights," it was unattainable
love. In "Before the Devil Knows
You're Dead," it was the freedom
wealth and power can afford. In
"25th Hour," itwassex. In"A Most
Wanted Man," it's some sort of
confirmation that what he's doing
will have weight in the world.
And it does - the man Bachmann
seeks is wanted, hunted by his
peers. But the cruel irony, and this
film's brilliance, is in realizing it's
for the wrong reasons, always for
the wrong reasons.
