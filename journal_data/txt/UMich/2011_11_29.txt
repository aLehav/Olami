Bullets from crowd
of protesters hit
officer and solider
ZUBIN POTOK, Kosovo (AP)
- A German NATO officer and a
soldier were shot and wounded
in a clash with Serb protesters in
northern Kosovo yesterday after
the military alliance's troops
used heavy machinery to remove
trucks and buses blocking a main
road in the tense region, an offi-
cial said.
The shooting near the town of
Zubin Potok, some 60 kilometers
(40 miles) northwest of Pristina
come after months of tensions,
following a decision by Koso-
vo's authorities to extend their
authority in the areas under de-
facto Serb rule.

For months Serbs have used
soil, rock and concrete barriers
to block any such moves. NATO
has threatened to remove them
because it cut off land supply to a
military base in the north. NATO
has ultimate authority over secu-
rity in Kosovo.
German and Austrian peace-
keepers involved in yesterday's
operation fired rubber bullets
and tear gas and used water can-
ons and pepper spray to disperse
the crowd of Serb protesters
trying to stop the soldiers from
removing the roadblock.
"The commander of the battal-
ion was shot and another soldier
was also wounded," said NATO
spokesman, Lt. Col. Uwe Nowit-
zky.
In Berlin, a German military
spokesman Lt. Col. Manfred
Baumgartner told The Associ-

ated Press that the wounded offi-
cer and the soldier serve in the
Bundeswehr. He said they were
shot from the crowd of Serb pro-
testers.
The two were sent at the U.S.
military base in eastern Kosovo,
Camp Bondsteel, for treatment,
NATO said.
At NATO's headquarters in
Brussels, the alliance said it was
concerned about the violence
and that it would carefully moni-
tor developments in the northern
country's north.
"The use of violence against
(NATO) troops is unacceptable,"
spokeswoman Oana Lungescu
said. "We urge all parties to
exercise restraint and cooper-
ate fully with all international
actors on the ground to ensure
freedom of movement without
delay."

Euro in danger as Europe
attempts to solve debt crisis

World markets
rally in expectation
of progress
PARIS (AP) - European
leaders rushed yesterday to
stop a rampaging debt crisis
that threatened to shatter their
12-year-old experiment in a com-
mon euro currency and devastate
the world economy as a result.
One proposal gaining promi-
nence would have countries cede
some control over their budgets
to a central European authority.
In a measure of how rapidly the
peril has grown, that idea would
have been unthinkable even
three months ago.
World stock markets, glimps-
ing hope that Europe might
finally be shocked into stronger
action, staged a big rally. The
Dow Jones industrial average

in New York rose almost 300
points. In France, stocks rose 5
percent, the most in a month.
More relevant to the crisis,
borrowing costs for European
nations stabilized. They had
risen alarmingly in recent weeks
- in Greece, then in Italy and
Spain, then across the continent,
including in Germany, the stron-
gest economy in Europe.
The yields on benchmark
bonds issued by Italy and Germa-
ny rose, but only by hundredths
of a percentage point. The yield
fell 0.1 percentage point on bonds
of France, 0.14 points for those
of Spain and 0.22 points for Bel-
gium.
Allowing a central European
authority to have some control
over the budgets of sovereign
nations would create a fiscal
union in Europe in addition to
the monetary union of the 17
countries that share the euro

currency.
Some analysts have said would
be a leap toward creating a Unit-
ed States of Europe. More deli-
cately, it would force the nations
of Europe to swallow their
national pride, cede some sover-
eignty and agree to strengthen
ties with their neighbors rather
than fleeing the euro union dur-
ing the crisis.
"The common currency has
the problem that the monetary
policy is joint, but the fiscal pol-
icy is not," Germany's finance
minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
said in a meeting with foreign
reporters in Berlin.
The monetary union has
existed since the euro was cre-
ated in 1999, but the European
Union, which includes the 17
euro nations and 10 others that
use their own currencies, has no
central authority over taxing and
spending.

Romney's historically
fickle political
stances called into
question
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -
Presidential hopeful Newt Gin-
grich acknowledged yesterday
that he isn't the perfect candidate
but contends he's "a lot more con-
servative than Mitt Romney and a
lot more electable than anybody
else."
Gingrich, a former House
speaker whose presidential cam-
paign is on the rise just weeks
before the first nominating con-
tests take place, offered sharp
criticism of Romney. For months,
the Georgia Republican has
refused to criticize his rivals and
instead has kept his focus on Pres-
ident Barack Obama.
That all seems to be over.
Branding the former Massa-
chusetts governor as a political
opportunist, Gingrich said it is
one thing to change positions if
new facts become available and
quite another to shift positions for
political gain.
"It's wrong to go around and
adopt radically different positions

based on your need of any one
election, then people will have to
ask themselves, 'What will you
tell me next time?"' Gingrich told
WSC-FM radio yesterday morn-
ingahead ofathree-day campaign
swingthrough South Carolina.
Romney has changed his posi-
tions on gay rights and abortion
since his first political campaign
in 1994. Since that unsuccess-
ful effort, he has publicly shifted
rightward.
It isn't enough to convince,
some, including Gingrich.
"We think there has to be a
solid conservative alternative to
Mitt Romney," Gingrich said dur-
ing a morning interview.
By evening, he seemed to tem-
per that.
"I don't know of a single person
who is running who would not
be a very effective member of my
administrative team," Gingrich
said at the College of Charleston.
At times Gingrich has blamed
the media for stoking the divi-
sions among the contenders in
an attempt "to get Republicans
fighting with each other," as he
put it during an NBC debate. "You
want to puff this up into some
giant thing," Gingrich said then.
Gingrich has seen his politi-
cal standing rise as he has posted

solid debate performances and
laid the groundwork for a tradi-
tional campaign. In South Caro-
lina, for instance, he has five
offices and his supporters are
making thousands of phone calls
every day.
Gingrich packed a town hall-
style event yesterday night at the
College of Charleston. Support-
ers who couldn't get in lined up
around the block in the hopes that
organizers would let more people
inside and out of the pouring rain.
While Gingrich's two divorces
and admissions of infidelity are
unlikely to endear him to Chris-
tian conservatives who have a
great sway here, he is pitching
himself as the candidate who can
best challenge Obama, who is
deeply unpopular among Repub-
licans.
He questioned Obama's alle-
giances, saying that the admin-
istration had sided with other
nations in challenging tough ille-
gal immigration laws in South
Carolina and other states.
"No American president has
the right to side with foreigners
against the people and laws of the
United States," he told the College
of Charleston audience.
But Gingrich knows his own
shortcomings.

$30 million spent

An anonymously funded free
college tuition program for high
school graduates of the Kalama-
zoo Public Schools that was
launched six years ago has spent
more than $30 million on higher
education for more than 2,300
students.
Data provided by The Kalama-
zoo Promise program show that
about one-third of the students
who started college on Promise
scholarships have dropped out, at
least temporarily, and another 10
percent of eligible students didn't
take advantage of the scholarship
program, the Kalamazoo Gazette
reported yesterday.
"Those numbers tell the story
of what still needs to be done,"
said Janice Brown, the program's
executive director.

A weekend of strong holiday
shopping in the U.S. and radical

yesterday. The Standard & Poor's
500 index broke a seven-day los-
ing streak and the Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 291
points, itsbiggestgain in a month.
Markets in Europe also surged
as leaders there discussed previ-

for containing the region's debt
troubles, such as joint bond sales
and much tighter fiscal controls.
France's CAC-40 jumped 5.5 per-

Columbian drug
trafficker captured
A top Colombian drug traffick-
er reputedly responsible for ship-

States through Central America
and Mexico has been captured in
Venezuela, officials said yester-
day.
The U.S. had offered a $5 mil-
lion reward for information lead-
ing to the arrest of Maximiliano
Bonilla Orozco, also known as
"Valenciano," who was also on
Colombia's most-wanted list.
Colombian authorities told
The Associated Press that Bonilla
was captured Sunday. The infor-
mation was later confirmed by
Colombian President Juan Man-
uel Santos, who was in Venezu-
ela meeting with President Hugo
Chavez.
"He's one of the most recog-
nized drug traffickers, who has
caused terrible harm to our coun-

try," Santos told Chavez at the
presidential palace.
TRIPOLI, Libya
Libyan clerics urge
leaders to disarm
rebel fighters
Dozens of Libyan religious
leaders yesterday urged authori-
ties to disarm former rebels and
form a national army, backing
the transitional government's
struggle to exert control over the
militias that overthrew dictator
Moammar Gadhafi.
The fighters are widely
admired for their role in bringing
down the Gadhafi regime, but the
clerics' statement reflected con-
cern over the militias' refusal to
submit to the central authority.
Dozens of militias have held on
to arsenals of heavy weapons and
sometimes clash among them-
selves.
"We advise speeding up the
process of establishing a national
army and the collection of arms,"
said a statement from the 250
imams and other clerics gathered
for a conference in Tripoli, the
first of its kind after the fall of the
Gadhafi regime.

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP)
- Egypt's first parliamentary
elections since the fall of Hosni
Mubarak brought the political
debut of a. potentially power-
ful new player on the scene,
the ultraconservative Islamist
movement known as the Salafis.
At several voting stations in
this Mediterranean coastal city
yesterday, Salafis packed the lines
as early as 7 a.m., an hour before
the polls opened, clearly dis-
tinguishable by the long, mous-
tache-less beards of the men and
the blanketing robes and veils of
the women leaving nothing of
their bodies visible but their eyes.
Their presence in the lines
only grew throughout the day,
as women in veils and gloves
passed out campaign fliers for
the Nour Party, the main Salafist
entry in the race.
"Anybody who is afraid of the
Salafis doesn't know who we
are," said Um Ibrahim, 43, who
wore a face veil and had dragged
her children to the polls with
her. "The Nour Party under-
stands religion the way that God
intended and they will lead us
properly."

expected to do well, likely to win
a plurality or even a majority in

the next parliament, raising the
likelihood that Egypt will see
an increased melding of religion
into its politics. Strongest is the
Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's
most organized political force,
in existence for 80 years with a
network of activists and chari-
ties nationwide.
After the lifting of Mubarak's
autocratic hand, newly created
Salafi parties have flooded onto
the scene. They are challenging
the Brotherhood's near monop-
oly on the religious bloc and are
likely to push even harder than
the Brotherhood for religious
rule.
They bring an ideology that
makes the Brotherhood look
moderate in comparison. Salafis
advocate a Saudi-style hard-
line interpretation of Islam that
brooks no compromise in a lit-
eralist interpretation of Shariah
law and advocates a staunch
segregation of the sexes. They
have long shunned the concept
of democracy, saying it allows
man's law to override God's.
During the election cam-
paign, their bluntness startled
many in Egypt, where even the
pious usually have a relatively
easygoing view. During an Alex-
andria rally, Salafis covered a
public statue with cloth because
it included mermaids. One Salafi
leader refused to appear on a
TV political talk show until the
female host put on a headscarf;
another insisted a partition be
put between him and a female
host. A sheik recently burst into

a concert at a Nile Delta uni-
versity, took to the stage and
shouted that music was "haram"
- religiously forbidden.
But the Salafis also highlight
why Islamists appeal to some.
In a nation where poverty is
widespread, Islamists - unlike
liberals - have taken the lead
in providing charity work and
social programs, including free
medical and educational ser-
vices for the poor. While liberals
fear imposition of Islamic law,
some in this intrinsically reli-
gious society look on an Islamist
candidate and see a moral per-
son who is less likely to be cor-
rupt.
"I am a divorced woman and
the Nour party candidates have
always helped me financially
to stand on my feet," said Hor-
reya Attia, a 52-year old mother
of two. "The least I could do is
return the favor at the polls."
In downtown Alexandria,
Amira Salah, 19, sat with her
friends talking about who to
vote for. She was dressed in a
way Salafis consider improper -
makeup on her face, jeans and a
colorful headscarf - but she sur-
prised her girlfriends when she
said she wanted to vote for the
Nour Party.
"They'll be able to run the
country in the right and God-
fearing way," she said. "They
will use the correct traditions of
the prophet to rule Egypt. Even
if they made me cover up from
top to bottom and wear a face
veil, I would be OK with it."

Safety agency
investigating Volt's
lithium-ion battery
amid fire concerns
DETROIT (AP) - General
Motors, concerned about the
image of its Chevrolet Volt, is
offering free loaner vehicles to
owners who are worried about
the electric cars catching fire.
The move comes after a gov-
ernment safety agency said on
Friday that it is investigating
fires involving the Volt's lithium-
ion battery packs following crash
tests. Thus far, the Volt tests have
not raised concerns about the
safety of other electric cars, the
agency has said.
GM said yesterday that the
vehicle is safe. But it will contact
owners of the more than 5,000
Volts sold in North America since
December2010 toreassure them.
It will also offer loaner cars to
ensure that owners are satisfied
and confident in their purchase.
GM has not put a time limit on
how longcustomers can keep the
loaners, but said the offer is not
a response to demands from cus-
tomers.
The National Highway Traf-
fic Safety Administration said a
Volt battery pack that was being
monitored caught fire on Thurs-
day, a week after it was hit in
a side-impact crash test. The.
agency said another battery that
was crash-tested recently gave
off smoke and sparks. The latest
fires are in addition to a battery
fire ata test facility in Wisconsin
back in June.
The Volt, which can travel
about 35 miles on electric power
before a small gasoline generator
kicks in to run the car, has helped
Chevrolet's public image, and
GM is eager to protect that good
will. The company has promoted
the car extensively as a first step
toward independence from for-
eign oil, and the Volt has helped
counter a gas-guzzling image left
over from years of GM selling
mainly pickup trucks and ineffi-
cient sport utilityvehicles.
Mary Barra, GM's senior vice
president of product develop-
ment, said both fires reported by
NHTSA occurred seven days to
three weeks after the crash tests,
and could have been prevented
if the battery charge had been
drained as GM has called for in
its post-crash procedures.
She said only a few Volts have
crashed on public roads. None
have caught fire, nor have the
battery packs been compro-
mised.

"We don't think there's an
immediate fire risk," said GM
North American President Mark
Reuss, who addressed the media
in a conference call along with
Barra. "This is a post-crash
activity."
NHTSA wasn't aware of the
post-crash procedures at the
time of the June fire, GM officials
have said. In the U.S., GM is noti-
fied of any severe Volt crashes
through its OnStar safety sys-
tem, and it sends a team to the
car within a day to drain the bat-
tery charge to prevent any fires.
In the Volt's system, Lithium-
ion battery cells, which essen-
tially are a single battery, are
assembled into a pack of cells,
and coolant is pumped between
the cells to keep them from over-
heating. In the June fire ata test
facility in Burlington, Wis., cool-
ant leaked from the battery and
crystallized, and that could have
been a factor in the fire, GM has
said. The fire came three weeks
after a side-impact crash test and
was severe enough to cause sev-
eral other vehicles parked near-
by to catch fire as well.
Barra said that in all the Volt
incidents, the battery cells were
not involved in the fires, only the
electronics within the battery
pack. But she would not be more
specific until NHTSA's investi-
gation is over.
Reuss said GM won't sell any
Volts in other countries until it
makes sure emergency respond-
ers, salvage yards and dealers
have been trained to discharge
the batteries after a severe crash.
The Volt and Nissan's Leaf,
with a total of more than 8,000
cars on the road in the U.S., are
among the first mass-marketed
plug-in electric cars. They went
on sale in the 2011 model year.
Other automakers are also work-
ing on electric vehicles.
The safety testing hasn't
raised concerns about electric
vehicles other than the Volt, but
NHTSA is asking manufactur-
ers who have electric cars on the
market, or who plan to introduce
them, for more detailed infor-
mation on battery testing. The
agency also is asking for the
companies' procedures for dis-
charging and handling batteries,
including recommendations for
reducing fire risks.
Lithium-ion batteries, which
are rechargeable, have been the
subject of several recalls of con-
sumer electronics. Millions of
laptop batteries made by Sony
Corp. for Apple Inc., Dell Inc.,
Lenovo Group Ltd. and other PC
makers were recalled in2006 and
2007 after it was discovered that
they could overheat and ignite.

Police choose not to
clear Occupy LA camp

Law enforcement
surrounded camp
for six hours
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Wall.
Street protesters declared a
minor victory yesterday when
they defied a midnight dead-
line to leave their tent city
encampment around City Hall
and police withdrew after
surrounding the camp for six
hours without moving in.
Four people were arrested
as police cleared downtown
streets to make way for morn-
ing rush hour traffic, but police
said the event was largely
peaceful.
Police Chief Charlie Beck
said it remains unclear when
the nearly two-month-old
Occupy LA camp would be
cleared. About half of the 485
tents hadbeen taken down as of
Sunday night, leaving patches
of the 1.7-acre park around City
Hall barren of grass and strewn
with garbage.
"There is no concrete dead-
line," Beck told reporters yes-
terday morning after hundreds
of officers withdrew without
moving in on the camp. The
chief said he wanted to make
sure the removal will be done
when it was safe for protesters
and officers and "with as little
drama as possible."
Protesters chanted "we won,

we won" as riot-clad officers
left the scene.
"I'm pretty much speech-
less," said Clark Davis, media
coordinator for Occupy LA.
Police turned back after
hundreds of Occupy LA sup-
porters showed up at the camp
Sunday night as the midnight
deadline for evacuation neared.
As the night drew on, many
demonstrators left.
Protester Julie Levine said
she was surprised that police
did not move in as the numbers
dwindled. "We were fearful,"
she said. "But we held our num-
bers and police were on their
best behavior."
A celebratory atmosphere
filled the night with protest-
ers milling about the park and
streets by City Hall in seeming
good spirits. A group on bicy-
cles circled the block, one of
them in a cow suit. Organizers
led chants with a bull horn.
A police tactical alert was
called that kept officers on
overtime. Officers reopened
the streets at around 6:30 a.m.
"Let's go get breakfast," said
Commander Andrew Smith as
he removed his helmet.
The protest was largely
peaceful but there were some
skirmishes.
Four people were arrested
for failure to disperse and a
few protesters tossed bamboo
sticks and water bottles at offi-
cers, Smith said.

Consolidating safety
Merging police departments can be successful
T hough city safety departments have not been safe from
statewide budget cuts, there may be a way to save money
without cutting these crucial services. In line with Gov.
Rick Snyder's plan to cut down on Michigan's spending, the Pontiac
Police Department was absorbed by the Oakland County Sheriff's
Office last August. The overall positive results of the consolidation
indicate that the change, especially in areas with a high crime rate
may increase departmental efficiency while also reducing Michi-
gan's heavy financial burden.

Though the decision to close the Pon-
tiac Police Department may have shifted the
department's .workforce, the move has saved
an estimated $2.2 million in state money. By
combining the expenses into one department,
the Oakland County Sheriff's Office was able
to hire 73 additional officers, many of whom
worked for or were previously laid off by the
former Pontiac Police Department.
The consolidation was initially planned as
a cost-saving measure, but the decision has
resulted in more action that targets crime.
Pontiac has seen a 400-percent increase in
arrests in the first four months following the
decision, according to a Detroit Free Press
article, which shows that the change has not
affected the ability of safety officials to do
their jobs.
While property crime has decreased in Pon-
tiac over the past several years, violent crime
is still on the rise. The city's violent crime rate
is drastically higher than the national average.
The hiring of the additional officers was only
possible because of the money saved through
the consolidation and was an important factor
in the 400-percent increase in arrests. Though
this method may not work in every jurisdic-
tion, the numbers show that the change has
been particularly effective in Pontiac.
Ann Arbor has recently suffered cuts to the
fire and police department budgets that have
resulted in a reduction of the number of per-
sonnel the departments can employ. Looking
into a potential consolidation of the two orga-
nizations could prove cost-effective and ben-

eficial for the city.
Snyder has long favored consolidations
like the one seen in Pontiac. The proven suc-
cess of the consolidation has stirred debates
in other areas of Michigan as to whether ser-
vices traditionally offered by cities should be
expanded into countywide jurisdictions. The
push for countywide consolidation of ser-
vices allows for greater oversight and stan-
dardization of worker compensation that the
current system lacks.
Regions in other states have discussed the
combination of police and fire departments
into a larger department that would cross-
train employees to respond to both fire and
public safety emergencies. Still others have
suggested combining non-safety depart-
ments such as parks and recreation and
water and sewage.
Opponents of these measures are concerned
that this would result in a public workforce
that has many skills, but fails to be experts in
one specific task. Regardless of whether these
policies are implemented, discussing different
options is crucial for arriving at a decision that
would be beneficial to Michigan's economy
and the safety of residents.
While more research is necessary to deter-
mine which services and regions would gain
the greatest benefit from consolidations like
the Pontiac-Oakland move, the increase
in arrests and the money saved by Pontiac
shows that these measures are a viable option
to save the state money without compromis-
ing public safety.

hen I told my grandfa-
ther this summer that
I wanted to become a
rabbi, I expected
he'd be excited
about it. I won-
dered which
of my relatives
he'd call first to
kvell about how
proud he was
that I wanted to MATTHEW
devote my life GREEN
to the continu- _
ity of our people.
But right when
I said the words, he turned to me
cantankerously and said, "What are
you? Nuts?" Hardly the delightI was
expecting. He's since come around,
but just last week at Thanksgiving
dinner, my aunt earnestly asked me,
"Why don't you want to do some-
thing more...fun? Like law, maybe,
or real estate?" I guess that's what
passes for fun in some circles.
In the past few months since I've
made the decision to pursue rabbini-
cal school, I've heard a wide range
of responses to it. Though most of
my relatives, friends and acquain-
tances are for the idea, a substantial
number are not. Some people seem
to think it's a joke or a waste of my
potential, as if the rabbinate were
some frivolous pursuit. Others sug-
gest that I'm limiting myself exclu-
sively to a small group of people orto
the study of ancient, irrelevant texts.
Many more don't know how to
respond at all. Religion can be a
tremendously uncomfortable sub-
ject, particularly between two indi-
viduals of different faiths. For those
steeped in the language of tolerance
and multiculturalism, it's sometimes
awkward to discuss religion with-
out stepping on anyone's toes. And a

huge proportion of people, particu-
larly in our generation, don't have
any use for spirituality whatsoev-
er- or they can't find meaning in an
organized faith. For what it's worth,
I'm noteven sure of how Ipersonally
connect to God or if I connect at all.
That's at least part of why I'm going
to rabbinical school.
In high school, many of my friends
weren't religious, but the few who
were felt that people judged them
for being devout Christians. They
said most of our friends excused my
interest in religion since being Jew-
ish carried with it a sort of mystique,
but looked at them as if they were
crazy and retrograde. In some ways,
I'm beginning to understand how
they must have felt. Religion often
feels like something of the past. Not
many people talk about becoming
clergymen and women in the 21st
century, and indeed it can sound a
little crazy. Even the word "clergy"
sounds old fashioned. And "rabbi"
sounds old country.
But the judgment I've perceived is
not just because I plan on becoming
a man of the cloth.
The reality is, if I said I was plan-
ning to go to law school that would
carry its own set of baggage and
stereotypes. From certain people I
could expect rolling eyes, comments
about slim job prospects or maybe
some snide remark about lawyers.
Take the business school senior
who, when asked about her plans
for next year, says: "Well, I got a job
with Goldman, but I'm only gonna
stay for a few years before I do my
own thing." Or the education major
who feels compelled to constantly
joke about how he's not in it for the
money. Or more poignant still, take
the unnamed University senior who
hasn't the foggiest idea of what he

intends to do next year and says he
plans to travel or take time off.
It's a common chorus, particu-
larly for those of us in our last year
at the University. Judgment abounds
as we publicly ponder our futures,
and from time to time, the voices
around us become voices inside our
heads. This job won't be lucrative
enough. That career might seem too
self-serving. This choice won't get
me where I should be in 10 years. It
sounds a lot like choosing a college.
And just like college, our careerswill
only be exciting or meaningful if we
make them that way. Fortunately, as
future University alumni, we have
that luxury.

Do we live to
work or work
to live?

1

While the judgment I face may be
about my faith as much as it's about
my career choice, fundamentally,
both forms are judgments on my
beliefs and ideals. As we try to figure
out what steps to take next, it would
probably behoove us all to figure
out what we actually believe before
we take the leap. We need to block
out all the other voices and ask our-
selves: Do we live to work or work to
live? And what is the point of living,
anyway?
Maybe you'll never answer those
questions, or at least not right now.
But it's worth taking a study break to
ask them.

Watching the videos of the University of
California, Davis police brutality gave me
the shivers. More than that, it made me want
to cry, scream with rage and yell for change
to anyone who would listen, no matter if they
had any power to change what was happen-
ing or not. Iam from Palo Alto, Calif. and have
43 friends and classmates at UC-Davis. I was
planning to visit them over the absurdly long
summer. Now I am not so sure. Do I want to
go visit a place that sprays its students with
pepper spray as they scream and cry?
The videos are disturbing to say the least.
The screams and choked cries of the 17 to
23-year-old students make y hands shake
as I type this. My heart rate kicked up, and
my breathing became shallow. How could a
police officer, probably with children or at
least nieces and nephews, do this to a group
of young people? In the video, the students
watching the scene yell through pepper spray
induced coughs, and shout their support for
protests and disbelief of the police. Camera
phones are pulled out of pockets to capture
irrefutable proof of these outrageously cruel
acts. Students look out for each other. The
spectators warn protesters of the incoming
pepper spray. And after students are dragged
from their peaceful circle, knelt on, hand-
cuffed and driven away, chants of "shame on
you" and "this is our university" reverberate
around the quad.
As police officers at a public university,
the officers involved in the UC-Davis inci-
dent have likely been around young adults
each day of work. Their job description is to
protect students as they make the difficult
transition from adolescence to adulthood.
College can be a confusing time in which
experimentation and boundary pushing can

go wrong and in some cases cause extreme
harm. Campus police are supposed to pre-
vent these problems, not cause them.
At the University of Michigan, the Univer-
sity's Department of Public Safety has made
it clear that the students are the number one
priority. The blue light emergency buttons
on campus and safe walk programs are clear
indicators that they take student safety seri-
ously. During orientation a DPS officer came
to speak to incoming freshmen, which, in a
day full of boring speeches and PowerPoints,
was the one thing that really stood out. The
officer told the group that he would rather
get a call and have it be nothing, than not
get a call and have it be something. Even
though DPS can be a pain - busting parties
and searching dorm rooms - I know that if
I was feeling uncomfortable I could call and
they would be there. But it's possible that
UC-Davis officers put the same emphasis on
safety to their freshman, and instead of abid-
ing by the policy, they turned on their own
students.
Protests and demonstrations have long
been a part of university life. College stu-
dents are outspoken people, and their schools
give them the freedom to express their opin-
ions. Most universities value that in their stu-
dents. The University of Michigan has shown
respect for peaceful student protests, which
can be interpreted as their commitment to
the Leaders and Best among their student
body. Universities are supposed to encourage
peaceful protests, but instead, UC-Davis, or
at least some of its police, decided that elimi-
nating an annoyance was more important
than encouraging students to act as leaders.

University money since financial
aid packages, which factor in the
cost of textbooks, would shift to
reflect the lower cost.
In addition to saving students
money on textbooks, the ini-
tiative would include an open
courseware component. Open
courseware allows Internet users
to view the content of a course,
which would alleviate the cost of
some course materials for Uni-
versity students, Courant said.
Several universities, including
Yale University and Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology,
already offer open courseware
content.
Courant added that the initia-
tive would allow students to have
continued access to course texts
and lectures even after they grad-

uate. SACUA Chair Kate Barald
asked if students would have
access to updated texts, which
Courant said was an option the
planners would explore.
Beside benefiting students
and the University's budget, the
program poses advantages for
faculty, according to Courant.
With access to a wider range of
materials, professors could tailor
course content to better achieve
their pedagogical goals, he said.
By linking pre-recorded lectures
to the online books, Courant said
professorswouldbe able to diver-
sify the content of their course
since they could spend less time
lecturing.
The initiative would encour-
age University professors to con-
tribute their excess materials,
like lecture notes for anintroduc-
tory course, to the open course-
ware, Courant added.
In winter 2011, the eTextbook

Working Group tested a similar
pilot program - a forerunner to
the Campus eTextbook Initiative
- that gathered feedback from
students and professors. Student
participants had mixed reactions
to the program, and Courant said
the planners took the students'
concerns into account when they
were creating the new initiative.
The planners of the initiative
took many cues from Indiana
University when designing the
program, according to Courant.
In fall 2009, IU began to imple-
ment an e-textbook model simi-
lar to the University's proposed
initiative.
Courant added that he hopes a
consortium of universities - like
the Committee on Institutional
Cooperation which includes the
universities in the Big Ten and
the University of Chicago - will
be involved in negotiations with
e-textbook companies.

holds extensive power over daily
bureaucratic activity.
"There is worry that the
future of Egypt will remain a
military state (and) not a demo-
cratic civilian state," Said said.
"Street politics must continue to
put pressure on the military."
While Egypt and the U.S. are
geographically distant, mem-
bers of ESA along with other
University students argue it is
the responsibility of U.S. citi-
zens to support international
issues of democracy.
"This does affect you," LSA
junior Sarah Awad-Farid, an ESA
member, said. "We do not live in

a secluded world anymore. We
are all interconnected."
ESA members urge students
to get involved by contacting
their U.S. representatives and
the Egyptian embassy in Wash-
ington, D.C. The organization's
members also believe voicing
their opinions through these
outlets will promote universal
democracy that benefits interna-
tional and domestic affairs.
LSA senior Daniel Hast, a
passerby at the protest, said he
has noticed similarities between
Egyptian goals for democracy
and the existing democratic
ideals in the U.S. Hast said he
feels controversies including the
University of California-Davis
pepper-spraying incident - in
which a police officer sprayed

a nonviolent group of students
- and the Occupy Wall Street
movements are related to what
is going on in Egypt.
"The parallels are disturb-
ing ... the tear gas used against
unarmed protesters in Egypt.
That sounds familiar," Hast said.
"They're using the same tactics.
It's just a matter of degree."
Despite the controversies over
civil protests, LSA junior Amre
Metwally, a member of ESA, said
he is thankful for democracy in
the U.S.
"Don't take things for grant-
ed," Metwally said. "Assembling
in a square could mean the end
of (Egyptian citizens') lives.
They could be shot by police.
Be thankful and be politically
active."

tions available for students online
are from two years ago."
Hutchinson pointed out that
many students don't know they
can access course evaluations
online. The Michigan Student
Assembly also offers an online
tool called Advice Online, but
Hutchinson said it's not useful
because it's not updated.
"Some students might not even
be aware that they can access
past course evaluations online."
Hutchinson said. "The problem
is (University's tool is) two years
behind."
Engineering junior Kyle Sum-
mers, MSA chief of staff, says MSA
is aware of the site's obsolescence
and is working to make it more
timely and user-friendly.
"It's a very manual and some-

what technical process to update,"
Summers said. "Ideally, whether
or not we have something new,
(the site) will be updated by the
end of the semester."
Summers added that MSA
wants to ensure that the informa-
tion is distributed with students in
mind.
"We'll be having more meetings
throughout the semester to dis-
cuss more possibilities," Summers
said. "We are really interested
in keeping (the site) very student
'focused and student feedback ori-
ented."
In addition to the University's
and MSA's websites that display
course evaluations, www.maiz-
eandbluereview.com, a Michigan
Daily-sponsored website offers
students course evaluation results
and grade distributions for class-
es.
Mika LaVaque-Manty, an
Arthur F. Thurnau professor of

political science and philosophy
who also received an overall qual-
ity of 4.8, said he thinks Univer-
sity-distributed evaluations are a
better indicator of instructor and
class characteristics than Rate-
MyProfessors.com.
"The official teaching evalu-
ations we use here, they are not
perfect," LaVaque-Manty said.
"They are in fact very far from
perfect, but I take those more seri-
ously because they are a better
representation of the students."
LaVaque-Manty, who some-
times reads the comments on
RateMyProfessors.com for feed-
back, said the numerical rat-
ings are not reliable. However,
LaVaque-Manty acknowledged
that students have no one to turn
to but each other for advice on
classes during registration.
"The University is actually
working on providing teaching
evaluation data to students more

effectively," LaVaque-Manty said.
"Obviously, it satisfies an impor-
tant need. We just need to provide
the information better."
Several years ago, LaVaque-
Manty was approached by mtvU
- the company that owns Rate-
MyProfessors.com - to be part of
a "Professors Strike Back" video
-a segment featuring videos in
which professors respond to stu-
dent comments. LaVaque-Manty
told mtvU that the website isn't
particularly helpful because most
of the reviews are based on how
much students like the professors,
rather than the professors' teach-
ing quality.
"Its obvious problem is selec-
tion bias," he said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily. "It's
either people who totally love you
or totally hate you - usually, the
ones who totally hate you."
On the site, instructors are
rated on helpfulness, clarity,

easiness and overall quality. Uni-
versity of Michigan instructors
received a professional average of
3.28. Hutchinson said she thinks
the rating categories on the web-
site are not useful because they
are too vague and generalized
to offer accurate insight about
courses and professors at the Uni-
versity.
"What does 'easiness' even
mean?" Hutchinson said. "If I give
my students the tools and materi-
als to succeed in my class, does
that make me an 'easy' teacher?"
Still, many University students
find the website to be a useful
resource. LSA sophomores Ash-
ley Nestorovska and Mandy Bro-
milow said they use the site as a
reference during registration to
read about prospective instruc-
tors. Nestorovska added that
though the subject of a class is
important, students' opinions of
a professor could also serve as a

determining factor when selecting
a class.
"Mostly, (I use it) to see if any,
classes are worth taking," Nesto-
rovska said.
Engineering senior Jared Slay-
baugh said the rating system on
RateMyProfessors.com is more of
a reference tool than an indica-
tor of whether the class is worth-
while. Though he said he often
checks the site during registra-
tion, the ratings only occasionally
affect his decision to enroll in a
course.
"I definitely take other things
into consideration other than just
the professor," Slaybaugh said.
"It depends on what I'm looking
to take the class for, too. If it's a
class for my major, I definitely try
to consider the interest level, how
(the professors) are with students,
stuff like that, because I'll put
more effort into it and care about
it more."

ACLU
From Page 1
is calling for a judge to rule the
policy unconstitutional.
The lawsuit also states that
Coleman's ad should not be dis-
criminated against because of
its controversial nature. Dan
Korobkin, staff attorney of the
Michigan chapter of the ACLU,,
wrote in a press release yester-
day that the case is pursuing the
protection of free speech.

"In a free and democratic
society, we cannot allow the
government to suppress political
speech, even if it is controversial,
makes some uncomfortable, or
stirs our emotions," Korobkin
wrote. "The solution is never to
censor unpopular speech, but to
allow others the same opportu-
nity to speak."
In the press release, AATA
:maintains that Coleman's pro-
posed advertisement breaches
the company's advertising pol-
icy. AATA officials could not be

reached for comment about the
lawsuit as of last night.
According to the ACLU press
release, AATA has previously
run advertisements regarding
race, religion and politics with
messages such as, "In Washt-
enaw County, black babies are
three times more likely to die
than white babies." Korobkin
wrote that AATA's acceptance
of the advertisements suggests
that Coleman's ad should also be
deemed appropriate.
"Once a public agency decides

to allow some people to speak, it
can't pick and choose between
the speech that it likes and the
speech that it doesn't," Korobkin
wrote. "By allowing some mes-
sages, yet censoring Mr. Cole-
man, AATA is doing exactly what
the First Amendment is designed
to prohibit."
In the release, Coleman wrote
that he chose to create the adver-
tisement to "empower" Pales-
tinians and increase awareness
regarding the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

"For generations, boycotts
have been an effective tool
to raise awareness and effect
change, and I personally believe
that a call to boycott Israel is the
best way to empower the Pales-
tinian people," Coleman wrote.
"However, you can't have a boy-
cott if the government won't
allow you to speak like everyone
else."
AATA CEO Michael Ford
wrote in an e-mail interview
last week that the ACLU had
acknowledged that Coleman's

advertisement maybe offensive.
"The standard is viewpoint-
neutral, and is designed to.
achieve the judicially-approved
objective of ensuring 'a certain
minimum level of discourse that
is applicable to everyone,' " Ford
wrote.
The ACLU initially contacted
AATA in August regarding its
advertising policy, and the press
release states that the company
did not respond positively to
attempts to resolve the issue
without litigation.

ASTRONAUT
From Page 1
vehicular activities, including
spacewalks, and spent 19 hours
and 55 minutes in the ISS. He
said being in the ISS is like being
in a regular house, except the
astronauts can use the walls and
ceiling in creative ways.
"You could be, sleeping on
the ceiling, and someone could
be working on the floor doing
work," Herrington said.
Herrington also described the

collaborations between the U.S.
astronauts and Russian cosmo-
nauts at the space station.
"The Russian side feels more
like home; you have meals there,"
Herrington said. "I had Thanks-
giving dinner there, and we had
pork and eggs. The American
side is very pristine and very
laboratory-like. I enjoyed being
trained by the Russian Air Force
officers. There is bonding to it."
Herrington holds degrees in
aerospace engineering, elec-
trical engineering and applied
mathematics and is currently

working on his Ph.D. in educa-
tion. However, during his fresh-
man year of college, he earned
D's in several classes and was
subsequently asked to leave the
University of Colorado. Her-
rington explained in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily
yesterday that he took that time
off to discover himself.
"I started college not know-
ing what I wanted to do." Her-
rington said. "The year I took
off, I worked in the mountains
as a surveyor on a civil engineer-
ing crew. I was hanging off cliffs

and holding a prism to reflect an
infrared beam of light from my
distance measuring device. The
practicality of math and the guy
I worked for convinced me to go
back to school and major in engi-
neering. And I did."
The University's chapter of
the American Indian Science
and Engineering Society invited
Herrington to speak on campus.
Engineering sophomore April
Yazzie, president of the Univer-
sity's chapter of AISES, said the
reason she joined the organiza-
tion is because Herrington is a

registered member of AISES.
"He's so down-to-earth,"
Yazzie said. "I'm so glad that
John was willing to come out
here and share the importance
of his Native heritage. He's one
of the only two Native astronauts
in the galaxy. We need somebody
like him to share his experience
and spread his success. "
Rackham student An Cao,
who is studying engineering,
said Herrington's address taught
her the importance of following
one's dreams and passion.
"The keynote speech has also

made me realize that I need to
think more positively about chal-
lenges with a better attitude,"
Cao said.
Kurt Hill, an academic adviser
in the College of Engineering,
described Herrington as a per-
sistent motivator who followed
his dreams.
"These heroes who have made
it can teach us that we could take
almost nothing and (make) some-
thing out of it," Hill said. "Persis-
tence and spirituality - that's
what they bring to the table, and
we need to take advantage of it."

Meyer hire changes the game

STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
It took him 23 years, but Urban
Meyer finally found his way back
to Columbus.
This time, Meyer isn't the Ohio
State football team's wide receiv-
ers coach and graduate student,
he's the head man. Meyer signed a
six-year contract to replace Luke
Fickell as the Buckeyes' head
coach on Monday.
Meyer returns to Columbus
as a bona fide commodity, hav-
ing captured two BCS national
championships in six seasons at
Florida, his last coaching stop. He
boasts an overall 104-23 record
And has gone 7-1 in bowl games.
Meyer's only bowl loss came to
Michigan in the 2008 Capital One
Bowl, the only time he faced the
Wolverines.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke,
coming off a 40-34 victory over
Ohio State, sees Meyer's arrival as
a welcomed challenge.
"He's not going to play a down
and neither am I," Hoke said.
"Me, knowing Urban, he's a good
football coach, good guy, going to
welcome him in.
"But this is still Michigan and
Ohio, and it's still going to be that
rivalry and neither one of us is
going to play a game."
Hoke and Meyer have never
faced each other or coached in the
same conference before, but both
are Ohio natives that began their
head coaching careers in the Mid-
American Conference - Meyer at
Bowling Green in 2001 and Hoke
at Ball State in 2003.
But as a native Ohioan, Meyer
understands the magnitude of
The Game.
"That's the game of games,
and the one I grew up watching,"
Meyer said. "It's also true that the
next game is 362 days away, so I
understand the significance of it.
"The one thing I know about
that game (is that) as much as
there is dislike and hatred across
college football rivalries, there's
a share of that, but there's also a
lot of respect in that rivalry. I'm
really looking forward to coach-
ing in it."
It was a short reign for Fickell.
After taking over as head coach
when former coach Jim Tressel
was dismissed on May 30, Fick-
ell was tasked with monitoring
a program already hindered by

'M' travels east in
first true road test

DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
In the past week, the Michi-
gan men's basketball team has
become familiar with leaving
the friendly confines of Crisler
Arena. But in its first true away
game, a matchup with Virginia in
Charlottesville, the Wolverines
won't have the benefit of a split
crowd - or mid-80s and sunshine
- like Maui had to offer.
And if Michigan (5-1) shows
early signs of any remaining jet
lag, watch for the Cavaliers and
their unconventional pack-line
defense to pounce.
"It's just so good," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein of the
defense. "It's not like pressure
defense, where you can get back-
doors or something. It's just real-
ly difficult to score against them."
The pack-line defense, used
almost exclusively by Virginia
coach Tony Bennett, empha-
sizes on-ball pressure, while the
other four defenders sag inside
the 3-point line to form a mock
perimeter. The objective is to take
away any penetration or backdoor
cuts - both of which flourished
for Michigan at the Maui Invita-
tional last week. Penetration was
key in freshman point guard Trey
Burke's success, as he was able to
drive into the lane with ease and
create scoring opportunities. The
Wolverines had an unusual week-
end after returning to the main-
land. After flying back on a Friday
red-eye flight and having Satur-
day off, the team's preparation
time for Virginia and its defense
has been limited.
Like Michigan, the Cavaliers
(5-1) have a young roster, featur-
ing just three seniors. But one of
those seniors, All-ACC forward
Mike Scott, is the main reason
Virginia was the preseason pick
to finish fourth in a strong ACC
field this year. After an ankle
injury sidelined Scott last sea-
son, the big man is going to be the
toughest post matchup the Wol-
verines have faced so far.
Scott, who was recruited by
Beilein at West Virginia, is aver-
aging 15 points and 10 rebounds
per game. Virginia's second
offensive option, guard Joe Har-

ris, poses a major threat from
beyond the arc. Though the soph-
omore is shooting just 32 percent
from 3-point range this year, his
presence must be respected after
he shot 42 percent last year.
"I'd seen them way back, and
they've gone through a transi-
tion, now (in their) third year
with Coach Bennett," Beilein
said. "They're very much play-
ing like the Wisconsins and the
Wisconsin-Green Bays. Just a
difficult, difficult team to play
against, both offensively and
defensively."
Heading into Maui, the offense
and particularly the play of Burke
were major question marks. But
in just one week, Michigan's situ-
ation looks brighter.
"I do see some things that are
very promising," Beilein said. "I
liked how we played with great
passion and energy and confi-
dence against some really good
teams. Biggest question was Trey
Burke, how is he going to do now
that he's out there. I think he per-
formed fairly well."
However, the Wolverines' post
play continued its inconsistency
in the Maui Invitational. While
sophomore forward Jon Horford
showed glimpses of the potential
Beilein has raved about, sopho-
more forward Evan Smotrycz
and redshirt sophomore forward
Jordan Morgan struggled.
Morgan found himself in early
foul trouble in two of the three
games in Maui.
Meanwhile, Smotrycz was held
scoreless in each of the tourna-
ment's games and has been criti-
cized for forcing shots.
"When he lets the game come
to him a little bit more, he's a far
more efficient player," Beilein
said. "He knows it. And he's just
got to continue to work at it.
When you're out there, it's a dif-
ferent thing. So he's adjusted a lot
in the past, he'll adjust again."
Aside from continuing its
momentum after a third-place
finish in Maui, Michigan will
again look to pick up a win in the
Big Ten-ACC Challenge.
Last year, the Wolverines went
on the road and knocked off
Clemson, a key factor in gaining
confidence.

football coach. Fickell dropped The Game to Michigan coach Brady Hoke (right) and the Wolverines on Saturday.

pending NCAA sanctions and
allegations.
A week later, starting quar-
terback Terrelle Pryor withdrew
from the university and began
training for the NFL's Supple-
mental Draft. Fickell was left
with a tattered program head-
lined by a promising young fresh-
man quarterback, Braxton Miller.
The resulting season wasn't
pretty. After losing to the Wolver-
ines for this first time since 2003
on Saturday, Ohio State crawled
to the finish line at 6-6 for a
fourth-place finish in the Big Ten
Leaders division.
The end was ominous for Fick-
ell - Hoke sensed that. When he
came to midfield after Saturday's
victory, Hoke gave the first-year
coach a few words of support.
"I just thought he did a heck of
a job all year," Hoke said. "Tough
situation."
Fickell will coach the Buckeyes
in their bowl game, after which
he will remain on staff at Ohio

State. His job description has not
been determined.
The three head coaching
changes between Michigan and
Ohio State in less than a calendar
year qualify as the most in the
rivalry's history.
Meyer's last game was a 37-24
win over Penn State in the Out-
back Bowl on Jan. 1, 2011. He
stepped away from Florida citing
family and health concerns and
spent the past season as a college
football commentator for ESPN.
At one point this spring, Meyer
toured the country visiting major
college football programs for
ESPN. He took in a Michigan
practice on March 30on the side-
lines at Schembechler Hall.
Does Hoke regretletting Meyer
inside the walls?
"No," Hoke said. "Nope."
A month later, rumors swirled
about Meyer as a replacement
for Tressel. His daughter, Nicki,
quickly quelled those rumors.
"HE IS NOT repeat NOT,

GOING TO OHIO STATE," she
tweeted on April26.
Seven months later, her father
stood at the podium in Columbus
as Ohio State's new head coach.
As for the effect the hiring has
on Michigan, Hoke says his sin-
gular focus is on recruiting. That
focus won't waver.
"Recruiting is the lifeblood of
the program," Hoke said.
The ability to close Ohio's bor-
ders to outside recruiting was a
point of emphasis for Ohio State
Athletic Director Gene Smith in
his coaching search.
"We wanted a football coach
who ... will create an environment
here with an aspiration for every
single football player in the state
of Ohio is to be a Buckeye and
come to the Ohio State Univer-
sity and have no other thoughts,"
Smith said.
Michigan's 2012 recruiting
class of 23 commits includes nine
players poached from the state of
Ohio.

es bueno, gracias.
Michigan will travel an ungod-
ly amount of miles this weekend
to play Alaska-Fairbanks and
try to snap its six-game winless
streak. The Nanooks are com-
ing off two shutout victories in a
row, but they were against lowly
Bowling Green. The hardest part
about playing Fairbanks (3-7-2
CCHA, 6-8-2 overall) is not the
team, but the travel.
But it doesn't matter who
Michigan (3-5-2, 7-7-2) is playing
anymore.
The issue isn't the other team.
Senior forward Greg Pateryn
has said that if this team is run-
ning on all cylinders, it's unbeat-
able. He might be exaggerating,
but to a certain extent, he's right.
Michiganhas one ofthebestgoal-
tenders in the nation in Shawn
Htunwick, one of the most excit-
ing young players in all of college
hockey in Phil Di Giuseppe and
one of the most respected coach-
es at any level in Red Berenson.
This is a team that should have
no problem making the NCAA
Tournament for the 22nd con-

secutive season. It's not the most
talented team Berenson has ever
coached, but it's good enough to
make some noise in the tourna-
ment.
But the thing that the Wol-
verines are missing right now is
something that Berenson can't
coach. He can coach the pen-
alty kill, the faceoffs and the line
changes, but he can't teach pas-
sion.
Michigan's issues aren't talent-
based. They are based off the one
lesson, the most important les-
son, that every kid hears on day
one. It's the lesson of hustle, hard
work and grittiness. It's the les-
son of not getting outworked by
anyone, anywhere, because the
minute you stop working is the
minute you let the other team
into the game.
The Wolverines haven't won
a game since Nov. 5 because
they haven't played like a team
that wants to win. They aren't
doing the little things - dig-
ging the puck out of the corner,
hustling out of line changes and
flying to loose pucks - that all
teams, even talented ones, have
to do to sustain success.
In some respects, it would be
easier for Berenson if he could
point to the defense, the special
teams or the goaltending and
definitively say, "This is what
we need to work on."
If it were that easy, junior
forward Chris Brown wouldn't
walk into a press conference
with his head in his hands,
mimicking the pose that senior
captain Luke Glendening struck
a week earlier. If Michigan's
problems were an easy fix, there
wouldn't be much of a concern.
Berenson has had teams in
the past that have looked like
locks to break the NCAA Tour-

nament streak. Two years ago,
the Wolverines finished seventh
in the CCHA and were relying on
the walk-on Hunwick to win the
CCHA Tournament and keep the
streak alive.
That team had no business
making the tournament, but
they did. That team had what my
high school football coach called
"want-to." They wanted to win
more than anything else, and did
whatever it took to become team
No. 20.
This team doesn't have that
- yet. Berenson and the older
players know it, but you can only
teach so much. You can't teach
want-to, that has to come from
within.
"We have to work harder,"
Brown said. "I know that's cli-

es - his three murals that sur-
round the gallery. Rosa explai'ned
that the pieces are distinct in the
cues they take from di SuveroW
interest in calligraphy, which is
rarely seen in the construction of
pieces like Shang or Orion.
"I'd become fascinated with
calligraphy from a young age,
which in part stemmed from my
childhood in China," di Suvero
said. "There is a fluidity in callig-
raphy, regardless of which scrip
which I began trying to capture
in my painting."
Equally intriguing is the lay-
out of the exhibition, which,
though numbered chronologi-
cally, fights against the museum-
goer walking a simple timeline
through the show.
"When you install, you never
install in the chronology of the
art, especially with sculptural
pieces," Rosa said. "When you
look at art three-dimensionally,
or even two-dimensionally, you
want people to feel moved by the
pieces, by forms and not by time."
Moving through the gallery,
the sculptures eventually lead
to a final project called Cumon,
under which is written, "touch
this piece." Gently spinning the
work, one becomes aware of the
intriguing power of these little
tabletops. More than just flesh-
ing out di Suvero's works with the
artist's aesthetics or highlighting
the diverse mediums of a great
artist, "Tabletops" actually allows
visitors to take the place of Shang
or Orion and tower over Mark di
Suvero's dynamic forms.

According to the Bill-
board Hot 100, Rihan-
na's "We Found Love"
currently holds the number
one spot and has held it, uncon-
tested, for
nine weeks.
It's Rihanna's
11th number
one single,
the first

number one
album (she's JOE
put out six in DIMUZIO
the last six
years) and
another swipe at keeping us
from forgetting her name (oh
na na) for more than a couple
weeks - a very necessary tenet
for a modern pop star.
I'm not sure it's anywhere
near her best singles ("Umbrel-
la," "Rude Boy") or somewhere
far above them. Produced by
Calvin Harris (of whose "I

cockiness and nothing else),
it's simple, stupid and huge in
all the right ways. Deploying
Rihanna's vocals like an after-

melody progresses like a seven-

turninga volume knob down for
a bit (verse) and then blasting it
all the way up (chorus).

'Martha Marcy May Marlene'

ALBUM REVIEW
Cornell back to basics

By ELLIOT ALPERN
Daily Arts Writer
Picture the scene: Tendrils
of smoke drift idly up to a hot
spotlight, which concentrates
its beam on
a single man *
perched upon
his stool. The Chris COmell
small crowd,
hidden by the Songbook
darkness of the Unoersal
venue, is anx-
ious but hushed

together into pure acoustic
enlightenment. But this isn't
Clapton picking away the first
strums of "Tears In Heaven" or
Bob Dylan getting ready to ren-
der the audience stunned. No,
this is Chris Cornell, his raw
voice building a sultry monu-
ment to Soundgarden's "Fell On
Black Days."
For a man who's done so
much, it's surprising to see that
Cornell has anything new to
offer - after all, his last three
solo albums commercially
flopped (and each garnered
more negative criticism than the
last). But Songbook is different:
The album consists of acoustic
covers that span Cornell's entire
career, from the grunge pioneer
Soundgarden to the supergroup
Audioslave and everywhere in
between. Songbook seems to
have found exactly the target to
which it must pander - the nos-
talgia of longtime fans filtered
through a fresh acoustic lens.
The end product - a smat-
tering of 16 live-recorded tracks
from nine different shows - is

quite easily Cornell's best solo
work since 1999's Euphoria
Morning. The divine rock idol
pushes an already impressive
vocal range early and often. In
"Call Me A Dog," a cover from
Cornell's early'90s tribute band
Temple of the Dog, the man's
emotive howl treads ever so
softly on the toes of modern
blues masters. His guitar melo-

and space isolated from the out-
side world, piecing together the
lives of the characters - and it's
entirely captivating.
The film opens with a mon-
tage of wide, grainy and static
shots of an unidentified rural
landscape, where anonymous
youths languidly work the field.
From this agrarian existence,
Martha (here called Marcy
May) escapes and is rescued
by her older sister Lucy (Sarah
Paulson, "Serenity"). Here the
narrative splits, telling the story
of Martha's readjustment into
normal life with Lucy and her
husband (Hugh Dancy, "Adam"),
a young couple trying to start a
family, in parallel with Martha's
time in a sinister, bohemian cult
in the wilderness.
While Martha tries to assimi-
late herself into her sister's life,
her behavior becomes progres-
sively stranger. She reveals socio-
pathic tendencies in her reticence
and detachment, as well as her
inability to behave and interact
appropriately with people. These
scenes are seen alongside the
story of Martha's involvement in
a cult led by the rugged, creepy
Patrick, played brilliantly by John
Hawkes ("Winter's Bone"), a mes-
merizing man who rules over his
cult's members (mostly young
women) completely - physically,
emotionally and sexually.

I'l show you, Mary-Kate!
As the title suggests, Martha
is an enigmatic, almost unknow-
able character. But thanks to a
powerful, nuanced performance
by Olsen, Martha comes beauti-
fully alive onscreen. Yet hers is a
complicated beauty - as the pas-
sive camera shows Martha mat-
ter-of-factly skinny-dipping in
broad daylight, or almost being
raped by Patrick, her sexuality
is a constant source of tension,
alternately alluring and disturb-
ing. Martha herself seems con-
fused by it, and this confusion
results in some of the film's most
compelling scenes.
Late in the movie, when Mar-
tha is becoming disillusioned
with the cult and wary of its
brutality, one of her fellow cult
members says, "There's no such
thing as dead or alive; we just
exist." It's a principle that the
movie mimics. Martha's past is
hazy, and her future uncertain
- she only exists in the present
moment. She and the rest of the
film's characters inhabit a time-
less, placeless isolation. As the
movie progresses, a crushing
loneliness bears down, guided
by the sure directorial hand of
Durkin, whose probing camera
never reveals a complete picture,
forcing Martha's feelings of iso-
lation on the audience.
"Martha" forces the viewer

to think, to engage with the
film intellectually and emotion-
ally. And though it's confusing
at points, the characters and
their relationships are fascinat-
ing. Durkin, for such a young
director, has complete control
over his film and an already fully
developed visual style.
Who even
knew there's
a third Olsen
sister?
As the film goes on, the lines
between Martha's life in the
cult and her time with her sis-
ter begin to blur. The transi-
tions between her memories and
the present become more fluid, E
so that sometimes it's unclear
which we're seeing. The events,
too, begin to mirror each other,
Lucy's behavior toward Martha
becoming eerily similar to her
treatment by Patrick and the
cult. It's a poignant comparison, '
but one that is at times heavy-
handed. However, it's a small
flaw in an otherwise perfect
film.
