Amid college and universities 

transitioning 
to 
online 
courses, 

mandatory 
store 
closures 
and 

limitations on large gatherings, 

the Washtenaw County Board of 

Commissioners voted on Wednesday 

to declare a state of emergency 

in the county. The motion, which 

passed unanimously, will allow 

for the shift of county resources 

to assist residents, businesses and 

communities affected by the novel 

coronavirus outbreak.

At a meeting of the Washtenaw 

County Board of Commissioners, 

chair Jason Morgan said he hoped 

the motion would help provide 

economic stability and protect the 

health of the community.

“For the health and safety of all 

residents of Washtenaw County and 

for the long-term stability of our local 

economy, public safety and criminal 

justice 
system 
and 
community 

social safety net, I am declaring a 

state of emergency,” Morgan said. 

“This public health emergency is 

unprecedented, 
touching 
every 

aspect of our lives, and some 

members of our community will 

need assistance meeting their basic 

needs, especially due to the closures 

of businesses and the dwindling 

availability of basic necessities.”

Some community members such 

as Keta Cowan, chief executive 

officer 
of 
Synod 
Community 

Services, voiced concern for those 

that are least able to get essential 

products and support during the 

outbreak, such as the elderly. Cowan 

also added that she felt that the 

county could do more to help those 

in need. 

“I am here because of the pandemic 

and the lack of response, and a lack of 

a prioritization guideline, in terms of 

how we are able to obtain resources 

to keep the least able safe,” Cowan 

said. “We are not only troubled 

because we know that the county has 

a store of backup supplies, but we’ve 

received no contact from anyone 

asking us what we might need.”

In response to the coronavirus 

outbreak, students in the School of 

Nursing now have to complete their 

work for this semester virtually 

while still meeting requirements 

set by the state nursing board and 

other accredited bodies.

Patricia Hurn, dean of School 

of Nursing at the University of 

Michigan, announced in an email 

Wednesday that Nursing seniors 

had 
completed 
their 
clinical 

placements.

“These 
requirements 
have 

all centered on the basic skills 

and competencies that are met 

by an on-site presence rather 

than simulation or classroom-

based education,” Hurn wrote. 

“Therefore, your on-site clinical 

placements are completed as of 

7:00 p.m. today, March 18th, for 

the remainder of the term. We 

want to congratulate each one of 

you! We are proud of you and your 

work.”

The 
announcement 
noted 

seniors 
will 
be 
required 
to 

“participate 
in 
innovative, 

remote 
experiences 
within 

your respective clinical groups” 

and will be updated by their 

respective faculty with more 

information.

Nursing senior Jayne Hubscher 

said she recognized it must have 

been a difficult decision for the 

University to make, and though 

she wishes she could finish her 

in-person clinical rotations, she 

said she understands the decision 

is best for student and patient 

safety.

Represent 
Michigan 

joined the race for the 

University of Michigan 

Central 
Student 

Government 
(CSG) 

election 
taking 
place 

next 
Wednesday 
and 

Thursday. The party is 

putting forth a slate of 

endorsed candidates — 

without 
an 
executive 

ticket — to vie for seats in 

the Assembly.

In an interview with 

The Daily, Engineering 

sophomore 
Carla 

Voigt, 
a 
current 
CSG 

representative 
who 

serves 
as 
Represent’s 

campaign manager and is 

running for re-election, 

said she first looked at 

each of the other parties 

running in the election — 

Mobilize and Change At 

Michigan — but felt they 

were not going to make 

the impact she wanted 

CSG to make. She said 

Represent was formed 

because neither of the 

other parties showed her 

they wanted to make a 

difference.

“We’re 
going 
to 

differentiate 
ourselves 

from 
the 
other 
two 

parties because they are 

saying that they are going 

to change things and that 

it’s going to be different,” 

Voigt said. “But I really 

was never shown that it 

is going to be different. 

And I want it to be. So we 

devised our own way.”

Represent’s 
platform 

includes 
affordability 

and accessibility; sexual 

assault 
prevention; 

diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion; 
mental 

health 
awareness; 
and 

sustainability. 
There 

are also platform points 

specifically 
targeted 

toward 
bettering 
the 

lives of certain groups 

on 
campus, 
such 
as 

international students or 

renters.

However, 
while 

all 
of 
the 
parties’ 

goals 
are 
similar, 

Engineering 
senior 

Mario Galindez, deputy 

campaign manager, said 

Represent’s 
platform 

stands out because of its 

achievability. 
Galindez 

said that instead of using 

buzzwords or creating 

five-year plans, as he 

said he has seen CSG do 

in the past, Represent’s 

platform 
includes 

tangible 
methods 
to 

efficiently 
enact 
the 

change they want to see.

“For us, it’s about the 

direct impact to students 

instead 
of 
general 

advocacy for ‘change,’” 

Galindez said.

The election will take 

place online on March 

25-26. With Represent’s 

announcement, the party 

becomes the third to 

enter to race for seats on 

the Assembly.

LSA sophomore Sam 

Braden, who is running 

for 
re-election 
as 
an 

LSA representative, said 

in 
previous 
elections, 

representatives 

campaigned 
for 
their 

party’s 
presidential 

and 
vice-presidential 

candidates. 
However, 

because 
Represent 

is not putting up an 

executive ticket, Braden 

said their campaign is 

focused more closely on 

developing 
plans 
with 

their representatives that 

will make a noticeable 

difference in the lives of 

students.

An amendment CSG 

passed 
in 
February 

requires the separation 

of 
the 
executive 

ticket and the slate of 

representatives endorsed 

by a party. Additionally, 

the 
amendment 
also 

declared there will be no 

party affiliations next to 

the names of candidates 

on the ballot.

Braden 
said 
even 

without 
this 
change, 

the party would not be 

hindered 
by 
running 

without 
an 
executive 

ticket. 
Voigt 
noted 

they still have the slate 

propping up what would 

have been the executive 

ticket, 
but 
they 
are 

promoting 
the 
party 

rather than two specific 

candidates.

To find representatives, 

Braden said they looked 

through 
Maize 
Pages 

and newspaper articles 

to 
find 
people 
who 

were 
enacting 
change 

across 
campus 
and 

encouraged them to run 

for representative seats. 

Braden said he did this so 

activists on campus can 

use CSG’s resources to 

elevate their ideas.

“There are people on 

campus who don’t get 

engaged with CSG, who 

are doing positive work 

and could use our million 

dollar budget that we 

wanted to engage via 

CSG and give them an 

opportunity,” 
Braden 

said. “Something I like 

about Represent is that 

we weren’t like, ‘We’re a 

party, come apply to us’ 

… We found people who 

are making a concrete 

change on campus and 

then we wanted to give 

them a boost.”

Voigt 
said 
she 
is 

hopeful CSG can move 

toward acting as a vehicle 

for improving students’ 

lives. She said she is 

optimistic 
about 
CSG 

because of its potential to 

advocate for students but 

has been disappointed 

by the lack of impact 

the 
organization 
has 

previously had.

“The current culture 

is just so one of just 

stagnant non-progress,” 

Voigt said. ”People are 

outcasts 
when 
they’re 

trying to do things, when 

it’s like, we’re supposed 

to be trying to do things.”

Braden 
said 
there 

have 
been 
previous 

efforts carried out by 

CSG, 
such 
as 
giving 

students free donuts, so 

students 
“know 
what 

CSG is doing.” While he 

said these efforts are 

somewhat beneficial, he 

would like students to 

know what CSG is doing 

because they are doing 

things that improve life 

for people on campus. 

Braden said Represent 

aims to do just that.

“We should be doing 

things for students that 

they know about because 

it affects them,” Braden 

said. “If we need to tell 

you what we’re doing, 

there’s a problem. If we 

aren’t 
affecting 
your 

lives, we aren’t doing our 

jobs.”

Represent joins CSG race 
without executive ticket

New party to challenge Mobilize, Change At Michigan for seats in 
upcoming Central Student Government elections on March 25-26


“At the end of the day, the patients’ 

safety has to come first, and we can’t 

risk exposing them to COVID-19 when 

there’s no actual screening process 

for the students,” Hubscher said. 

“Unfortunately, we’re going to have 

to finish up our clinical experiences 

online, but it’s what’s best in a situation 

like this which is unprecedented.”

In a separate notice directed to 

juniors sent out on the same day, Hurn 

said their on-site clinicals would also 

be suspended as of 7 p.m. Juniors will 

now have virtual clinical experiences 

for the remainder of the term and are 

expected to hold the last two and a half 

weeks in August for boot camp and 

deferred clinical experiences. 

In an email to The Daily, University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald noted 

students’ safety is of the utmost 

importance to the University, adding 

that alternative options are being 

developed to prepare students for new 

challenges they may face in clinical 

settings.

Previously, 
sophomore 
clinical 

rotations were canceled on Sunday 

in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Nursing juniors and seniors were sent 

a separate email on Sunday from Dana 

Tschannen, incoming associate dean 

for undergraduate studies at the School 

of Nursing, explaining why sophomore 

clinical rotations were canceled as well 

as offering future plans for junior and 

senior clinicals.

The email said the School of Nursing 

believed sophomores would be able to 

meet requirements set by the Michigan 

Board of Nursing and accredited bodies 

though a virtual format.

Nursing 
sophomore 
Samantha 

Toomey said she does not believe 

having online clinical rotations will put 

her behind.

“We’re still going to have the 

clinicals next year and the year after,” 

Toomey said. “This semester, we’re 

kind of just getting started, and we 

didn’t have a ton of responsibilities. 

Since we’re sophomores, we still have a 

lot of time to catch up and we have a lot 

more hours ahead of us.”

Toomey said she recognized the 

current situation is not ideal, however, 

she said she believes this change 

was essential to limit COVID-19 

transmissions.

“I think it’s a better learning 

experience to be in-person, but given 

the current situation, there are other 

things that are more important than 

getting our curriculum fulfilled,” 

Toomey said. “I feel like the health 

of the patient and student are more 

important than sticking to curriculum 

hours.”

At the time of the Sunday email, 

juniors had recently had their first 

clinical rotations of the year, and the 

email strongly encouraged them to 

keep attending current rotations. 

Seniors 
in 
nursing 
have 
two 

tracks they can choose to complete: 

Leadership 
and 
Management/

Community 
or 
Complex 
Care. 

Regarding 
the 
Leadership 
and 

Management/Community track, the 

email noted some community clinicals 

had already closed. For those that had 

not, the email said to continue going. 

For seniors in Complex Care, the email 

urged seniors to add an extra shift 

while they were looking at alternative 

options. 

Hubscher said a lot of students were 

trying to fit in as many hours as they 

could to finish their requirements as 

soon as possible. 

“One of my cohort (members) had 

considered doing 16-hour shifts at 

the hospital to get her hours done,” 

Hubscher said. “In the past, the most 

we’ve done is 12 hours.”

Nursing senior Joanna Yeh is on 

the Leadership and Management/

Community track and said her clinical 

instructor canceled her community 

clinical before the announcement 

today.

“My community clinicals were 

supposed to be at a retirement home,” 

Yeh said. “That’s probably not the 

best idea for us. A lot of us work at the 

hospital, and we’re going in and out of 

the hospital. It’s not a good idea for us 

to go into a retirement home for people 

who are literally the most vulnerable 

population.”

Yeh said she was not worried about 

graduating because she believed her 

instructor was doing everything in her 

power to provide support to students.

“My clinical instructor has made 

it very clear that she’s going to make 

sure we will graduate no matter 

what happens,” Yeh said. “She’s gone 

through all these different modules 

in order to make up for the hours that 

we’re missing from being in person.”

Many Nursing students told The 

Daily they felt stressed and confused 

as they were not certain what would 

happen to clinical rotations and 

classes moving forward as the 

COVID-19 situation develops.

Yeh 
said 
she 
was 
anxious 

when the University first began 

responding to COVID-19 because 

of the uncertainty. However, she 

said she understands this is a 

developing situation and is grateful 

to the School of Nursing for 

providing frequent updates. 

“The 
School 
of 
Nursing 
is 

honestly doing a pretty good job 

with keeping us updated,” Yeh said. 

“Things are changing every second, 

they’ve been sending us so many 

different emails with the changes. 

They’re keeping us updated to the 

best of their ability and I can’t be 

mad at that. I know it must be hard 

to be on both sides.”

Reporter Francesca Duong can be 

reached at fduong@umich.edu.

In 
the 
press 
conference, 

Whitmer said the state is making 

decisions based on the best science 

to slow the spread of the virus.

“Our administration and our 

partners and state government are 

working around the clock, working 

to slow the spread of coronavirus,” 

Whitmer said. “Michiganders are 

some of the most resilient people 

in the nation, and we have faced 

and overcome serious challenges 

before … We’ve gotten through 

these times together, and we will 

get through this as well.”

On Thursday, Whitmer ordered 

a shutdown of all K-12 schools in 

the state until April 5 and banned 

all events with more than 250 

attendees on Friday. The governor 

also issued an executive order on 

Monday to close all restaurants, 

bars and entertainment venues in 

Michigan to attempt to slow the 

spread of the virus. 

Whitmer 
emphasized 
the 

actions she has taken within the 

past week in response to COVID-

19 are temporary. She said all 

Michigan citizens have a role to 

play to mitigate spreading the virus 

and its impact on our economy.

“These are tough and necessary 

steps that we are taking to ensure 

that we reduce the spread of this 

virus,” Whitmer said. “We know 

that by taking aggressive action, 

we are saving lives.”

Whitmer 
encouraged 

Michigan 
citizens 
to 
practice 

social distancing and to take 

precautionary measures to reduce 

the spread of the virus. The Centers 

for Disease Control and Prevention 

recommend people wash their 

hands often with soap and water 

for 20 seconds, avoid close contact 

with other people and stay home if 

they feel sick.

Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical 

executive of Michigan Department 

of Health and Human Services 

(MDHHS), emphasized protecting 

those most at risk, including the 

elderly and immunocompromised. 

She said state labs in Michigan 

have a goal of testing 200 patients 

for COVID-19 a day, which they 

plan to be able to accommodate for 

by the end of the week.

“This is a very serious situation,” 

Khaldun said. “As the situation 

continues to develop, we expect 

more cases, and unfortunately, we 

expect more fatalities.”

Khaldun said the MDHHS sent 

500 tests to medical providers 

across the state throughout the 

past week. She said the state is 

working on getting comprehensive 

data from hospitals on resources.

As of Wednesday, there have 

been 80 confirmed COVID-19 

cases in Michigan with seven of 

the cases in Washtenaw County. 

Two cases of the virus have been 

confirmed in student apartment 

buildings Vic Village-North and 

ArborBLU.

The University of Michigan 

began the shift to online classes on 

Monday for the remainder of the 

semester in response to COVID-

19. The University also canceled 

commencement 
and 
all 
study 

abroad programs scheduled for the 

Spring and Summer semesters.

Morgan recognized Cowan and 

addressed her worries. He said 

declaring a state of emergency would 

help the board respond to the needs of 

the community. 

“As we heard from Keta today, what 

we are talking about are the ancillary 

impacts beyond just the public health 

aspect of things — the residents who 

are food insecure or homeless, our 

economy or local businesses and all 

these other aspects that I truly believe 

are reaching a point of a state of 

emergency now and looking forward,” 

Morgan said. “Everything we do now 

to mitigate the impacts on our local 

businesses and our residents will help 

us in the long term.”

District 2 Commissioner Sue Shink 

said she and her colleagues have been 

working to respond to the pandemic 

and mitigate its impact on the county.

“We have been talking about 

vulnerable populations,” Shink said. 

“We know that there have been efforts 

made … We really care and are taking 

this seriously.” 

Morgan also laid out plans for 

additional efforts that would serve 

other parts of the community.

“The county has enacted their 

contingency 
plan, 
and 
although 

buildings are closed to the public until 

April 6, 2020, several departments 

continue to provide essential services,” 

Morgan said. “Other efforts include 

the extension of grace periods on fees, 

fines and costs, as well as working 

to support school districts who are 

providing much-needed meals to their 

students.”

Morgan 
also 
discussed 
the 

utilization 
of 
the 
Emergency 

Operations Center, which coordinates 

the reaction to large-scale emergencies 

in Washtenaw County. However, 

Morgan noted that the center may only 

be reached remotely.

“We’re 
going 
to 
activate 
the 

Emergency 
Operations 
Center, 

remotely or virtually,” Morgan said. 

“There are a lot of those aspects that 

we still need to work through, as this is 

pretty unprecedented.”

The Senate Assembly elected 

three faculty members to the Senate 

Advisory Committee on University 

Affairs on March 16 and 17 via 

electronic voting. 

The 
Assembly 
intended 
the 

vote to be conducted in person, 

but due to the University of 

Michigan’s guidelines to prevent 

the spread of COVID-19, the Senate 

Assembly voted through the newly-

implemented Simply Voting online 

platform. 

Speaking 
to 
the 
University 

Record, MaryJo Banasik, director 

of the Faculty Senate Office, said 

she thought allowing voting to take 

place online was an important way 

to promote participation.

“We feel that because people were 

able to vote remotely, particularly 

in this kind of situation when 

people are working remotely, we 

got a lot more participation than we 

normally would have had,” Banasik 

said. 

From a field of nine candidates, 

the Senate Assembly chose J. Caitlin 

Finlayson, 
associate 
professor 

of

F 

resh off the departure of former 

Mayor of South Bend, IN, Pete 

Buttigieg from the presidential 

pursuit, many have claimed he bridged 

the gap between religion and the LGBTQ+ 

community. But it’s quite the opposite. As 

someone from the religious Western part 

of Michigan, the church I was raised in 

began denying communion to its LGBTQ+ 

members this last holiday season. The move 

ostracized me and several other community 

members from an already unwelcoming 

environment, as the primary push against 

the LGBTQ+ equality movement has 

originated from religious organizations and 

institutions. While Buttigieg has benefited 

from his membership in the church, many 

in the LGBTQ+ community have found 

historic oppression and ostracization from 

the religious right. 

While not every religious person and 

institution uses their power and faith to 

oppress the LGBTQ+ community, recent 

discrimination has been masked by religious 

freedom and restoration laws. States across 

the country have used the Religious Freedom 

Restoration Act to push discriminatory 

agendas by allowing businesses, providers 

and employers to deny services to LGBTQ+ 

individuals by claiming religious exemptions, 

as seen in Texas. Recently, Tennessee passed 

a law allowing adoption agencies to deny 

service to LGBTQ+ couples, citing claims 

of religious freedom. Laws like these across 

the country allow for open discrimination 

and perpetuate the second-class status of 

LGBTQ+ individuals, justified by quotes 

from scripture.

The Supreme Court furthered this 

divide between LGBTQ+ individuals and 

religious institutions in the case of Burwell 

v. Hobby Lobby, wherein a Christian-family-

owned business won the right to not include 

contraceptive methods in their employee’s 

health care plans, despite it being required in 

employee health care plans by the Affordable 

Care Act. This opened up the floodgates for 

discrimination by allowing companies to 

exercise religious objections.

This precedent was furthered in the case of 

Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil 

Rights Commission, where the court sided 

with a religious baker who refused to sell a 

wedding cake to a gay couple. The Supreme 

Court, primarily seen as the champion of the 

unprotected minority, has frequently ruled 

in favor of religious freedom over the rights 

of LGBTQ+ Americans, allowing for open 

discrimination and anti-LGBTQ+ biases. 

While the courts and lawmakers deny 

LGBTQ+ individuals basic rights and 

services by siding with religious institutions, 

youth are directly impacted. LGBTQ+-

identifying 
individuals 
make 
up 
an 

alarming 40 percent of the youth homeless 

population. Nearly seven in 10 LGBTQ+ 

homeless youth cite family rejection as the 

main cause for this. That same rejection 

that I felt from my childhood church is felt 

across the country as LGBTQ+ youth must 

grapple with the realities of their identities 

all while institutions intended to be safe and 

welcoming are given free reign to turn away 

and discriminate. 

Further, communities of faith and 

religious leaders frequently serve as role 

models and support systems for young people, 

but that is often not an option for LGBTQ+ 

youth. In a country where LGBTQ+ high 

schoolers attempt suicide at four and a half 

times the rate of their straight peers, clergy 

leaders could serve as an outlet of support for 

youth. In addition, transgender-identifying 

individuals attempt suicide at nine times the 

rate of the United States population and are 

seldom welcome or embraced in religious 

institutions. Frequently, transgender support 

is found in groups that are not religiously 

affiliated, atheist or agnostic, furthering 

the rift between religious groups and the 

community.

As religious institutions have pushed 

against the LGBTQ+ community and been 

plagued by controversy, there have been 

steep declines in religious affiliation and 

confidence in organized religion. Today, 74 

percent of Americans are no longer confident 

in organized religion and 36 percent of 

millennials do not identify with a religion, 

marking drastic dips among more open-

minded and younger generations. This 

drive away from organized religion can be 

explained by multiple factors but marks a 

pivot away from oppressive institutions to a 

focus on faith, individualism and empathy. 

Religious institutions must evolve to reflect 

the public shift in sentiment towards the 

LGBTQ+ community in order to retain their 

spot in American life.

While I have no doubt that the majority 

of individuals practice religion to find 

community and direction, the institutions 

and texts have been used as a mode of 

discrimination. Those in power and those 

seeking to put down marginalized groups 

have historically abused religious teachings 

to contradict the purposes for which they 

were created, to love and accept all people. 

The shift from acceptance to oppression 

has taken form in religious freedom laws 

that give license to discriminate based on 

homophobic and transphobic prejudices. 

The conversation of religious freedom must 

shift to one of equality and expose the series 

of laws and practices put in place to oppress 

and perpetuate the second-class status of 

LGBTQ+ individuals across the nation.

LGBTQ+ discrimination as religious freedom

N

ot many students have 

direct 
experience 

with 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
International 

Center, as only 2,216 of us are 

actually 
international 
students. 

The International Center is one 

of the University bodies that 

directly represents me and all 

other international students at the 

University. However, I cannot say 

that I have been entirely satisfied 

with the representation they have 

provided so far. The International 

Center could, and ultimately should, 

do better. 

All Korean male adults have to 

serve in the military in one form 

or another, unless they have severe 

mental or physical health conditions 

hindering them from effective 

service. I was unfortunately healthy 

enough to serve in the army and my 

20-month-long service began in 

October 2017. In order to complete 

the mandatory service requirement, 

I had to take a temporary leave 

from the University and planned 

on returning to continue my 

undergraduate program for the 

Fall 2019 term. With the temporary 

leave, my I-20 — the immigration 

document 
required 
by 
the 

University — had to be cancelled; 

in order for me to return, I needed 

a new one. I called the International 

Center to ask some brief questions 

regarding 
the 
return 
process, 

including whether I needed to 

reapply for a new I-20 or F-1 student 

visa and if an override for class 

registration was required. I was 

told to either schedule a phone 

appointment with an advisor 
— for 

which the earliest date happened 

to be about three weeks later — or 

send an email about my inquiry. The 

latter was the natural choice, as I 

did not have the luxury of making 

international phone calls whenever 

I wanted while serving in the army. 

I sent an email to the International 

Center with these same questions, 

believing them to be simple enough 

for any staff member to answer. 

Five days later, I was surprised by 

a generic response to my email, 

but I still felt comfortable with the 

information and my reentry to the 

University. 

According to the email, I did 

indeed need a new F-1 student visa. 

Without much external information 

or any similar past experience, I 

trusted the information handed 

to me by the official University 

institution that dealt with these 

kinds of issues. This was in 

November 2018, so I believed I 

needed a new visa until the summer 

before coming back, when I had an 

indescribable urge to double-check. 

I decided to call the Embassy of the 

United States in Seoul myself to ask 

if I had to be issued a new visa, and 

the answer was no. In fact, I only 

needed a new I-20. If I had followed 

the instructions given by the 

International Center, I would have 

wasted the $160 F-1 visa fee. 

The international student fee is a 

more recent case of the University’s 

lack of clarity or consideration 

for international students. The 

University decided to add an 

international student fee of $500 

per semester starting in Fall 2019. 

At the time of registration and 

tuition payment, I was filled with 

excitement about finally returning 

to Ann Arbor after two years and 

overlooked it. The $1,000 per school 

year fee came to my notice only 

recently, as the International Center 

updated 
information 
regarding 

the extra-tuitional charge. The 

center says the fee will “enable the 

university to maintain and enhance 

its campus-wide commitment to 

international 
student 
services, 

programming, and administration.” 

The Frequently Asked Questions 

section about the fee, from the Vice 

President 
for 
Communications 

for Public Affairs, provides more 

detail about it. However, the 

only overarching theme I could 

understand was that the University 

is charging international students 

due to declining state support. 

The first explanation for the 

purpose of the fee was “to address 

increased costs and expansion of 

services during a time of declining 

state appropriations support and 

pressures 
on 
the 
university’s 

finances.” According to former 

Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, 
the 

University is assessing such fees 

because it highly prioritizes 

providing sufficient services and 

infrastructure to the much-valued 

international students. However, 

while international students had 

to face extra fees, the University 

boasted the lowest in-state tuition 

increase in six years for Ann 

Arbor in the same article. The 

International Center does not 

provide much more information 

and clarity about the fee, at least on 

the surface.

I am not filing a personal 

complaint 
towards 
the 

International 
Center 
about 

misleading information or the fee, 

but rather raising questions about 

the University’s attitude toward the 

international student community. 

Immigration 
documents 
and 

processes are highly important 

and 
sensitive 
information 
for 

us, as our legal entrance to the 

country depends on them. To have 

been misinformed about such an 

important matter far exceeds the 

possible monetary waste of $160. 

While it is clear the International 

Center provides a variety of events 

and resources, including advising, 

to international students, I cannot 

fully understand the imposition of 

an additional $500 fee per semester 

when the University tries its best to 

minimize the increase of in-state 

tuition. 

Again, the University is a 

public institution that mainly 

serves the state of Michigan in 

various purposes, so I understand 

that its main focus is on students 

from Michigan. However, the 

University did not hold back in 

letting everyone know that they 

minimized the tuition increase 

for in-state students despite the 

overall increased costs being due to 

the decline of in-state support. The 

University’s decision to minimize 

the tuition of one group and 

increase that of another in a time of 

heightened operating cost does not 

align logically.

Even 
the 
most 
competent 

staff can make mistakes when 

dealing with complicated issues 

like immigration. It is only right 

that those who benefit from 

special 
services 
and 
certain 

accommodations pay for such 

provisions. All that being said, I am 

still left with one question: Does the 

University really care about us?

Does the University really care about international students?

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

DOMINICK SOKOTOFF/Daily

Design by Jack Silberman

In observance of Women’s History 

Month, The Daily’s sports section is 
launching its third annual series aimed 
at telling the stories of female athletes, 
coaches and teams at the University 
from the perspective of the female sports 
writers on staff. Daily sports editor Aria 
Gerson kicks off the series with this 
story.

On one side of the pool at the London Aquatic 

Club, the older swimmers train for competitions. On 

the other, younger swimmers perfect their strokes 

with styrofoam flutterboards. Each flutterboard is 

emblazoned with an autograph.

In the fall, the last time Maggie MacNeil returned 

to her hometown of London, Ont., her coach, Andrew 

Craven, asked her to take pictures with the young 

athletes and sign their flutterboards.

It’s a similar scene every time she comes home. The 

kids rush to her, asking for autographs and photos. The 

local radio stations and newspapers ask for interviews. 

Everyone knows who she is — Maggie MacNeil, world 

champion.

In Ann Arbor, MacNeil’s presence is much harder 

to spot. The entrance to the pool deck at the Canham 

Natatorium is lined with swim caps of Olympians 

who swam for Michigan. There are lists of NCAA 

champions. Soon, MacNeil could be among them. But 

she isn’t yet.

MacNeil is, of course, still well known within the 

confines of the natatorium. She’s the best swimmer on 

an already-stacked Michigan team. She’s a 10-time Big 

Ten champion in just her sophomore year. Every other 

swimmer knows that in a butterfly or sprint freestyle 

event, she’s the one to beat.

But MacNeil isn’t the only swimmer on her team 

who’s contended for conference championships, 

NCAA championships or even the Olympics. She 

was only one of nine who competed at the World 

Championships last summer. The Wolverines don’t 

have to pin their hopes on her.

Outside the pool, MacNeil keeps a fairly low profile, 

not boasting her status as one of the world’s top 

swimmers. Other than her block ‘M’ backpack all the 

athletes wear, she could be any other student.

On campus, no one really knows who MacNeil is. 

She likes it that way.

***

When MacNeil was growing up, one of her mom’s 

rules was that she could never get a tattoo. But her mom, 

Susan McNair, didn’t want to seem like a complete 

stick-in-the-mud, so she added one condition. MacNeil 

could get a tattoo of the Olympic rings — if and only if 

she ever got to the Olympics. “Knowing full well that 

I would never have a child who got to the Olympics,” 

McNair said.

Back then, McNair’s thought process was sound. 

MacNeil wasn’t one of those kids you always knew 

might be destined for the Olympics. She was good, yes. 

Good enough to go to nationals-level meets at the age of 

12, good enough to be selected for international events 

like the 2018 Junior Pan-Pacific Championships, good 

enough to be recruited by top NCAA programs. But 

MacNeil hadn’t hit the level of some other swimmers 

her age, and because of that, most of the pressure on 

her was pressure she put on herself.

In 2017, she didn’t make the Canadian team for 

the World Junior Championships. She won medals at 

national and regional meets but hadn’t quite reached 

the pinnacle of her sport. 

Even teams that recruited her, like Michigan and 

California, had reservations. She was strong in the 100-

yard butterfly, but teams were concerned she might 

just be a one-trick pony. Michigan assistant coach Rick 

Bishop, who primarily works with the women’s team, 

wasn’t sure whether the Wolverines were the right fit. 

MacNeil, after all, came from a club where she was 

always the best — better, even, than the boys. With the 

Wolverines, she’d be in a much bigger pond.

Head coach Mike Bottom, though, was sold from 

the beginning. He saw someone with a strong work 

ethic and good results for the club she came from. 

But Michigan didn’t see MacNeil as a future world 

champion — just a solid addition to a top team.

“Neither one of us really went into it with these 

outrageous expectations,” Bishop said. “I think she 

truly made a good decision in (that) she liked the 

University of Michigan. We didn’t have this massive 

expectation that we were recruiting this superstar 

talent, and she didn’t have this massive expectation 

that we were gonna get her to some crazy place.”

Bishop’s philosophy is to take a swimmer and, 

instead of improving her weaknesses, coach to her 

strengths. MacNeil was a strong underwater swimmer 

with good closing speed, so she and Bishop worked to 

make sure she was the best underwater swimmer with 

the best closing speed. 

That was when she began to burst onto the scene.

MacNeil was used to swimming as an individual. 

But the team environment of Big Ten dual meets — the 

parents in the stands, the constant cheering, the feeling 

of cheering for weaker teams to win so Michigan’s 

biggest competitors got fewer points — invigorated 

her. Suddenly, she was swimming not only for herself, 

but for 32 others. It took some of the pressure off, 

because her team was there for her. 

In 2019, her freshman season, she won two 

individual conference championships and two more as 

a member of a relay team. At NCAA Championships, 

she notched a second-place finish in her signature 

event, the 100-yard butterfly, and finished fourth in 

the 50-yard freestyle. Then, in April, she made the 

Canadian team for the World Championships. Even 

still, Craven’s realistic expectation for MacNeil was 

maybe making the semi-finals of the 100 fly.

Instead, all it took was 55.83 seconds for MacNeil to 

go from unknown to the top of the swimming world.

Before MacNeil’s race at Worlds, she strategized 

with Bishop for how she could beat her biggest 

competition: Sarah Sjöstrom, a Swedish swimmer 

who has been nearly unbeatable in the event since 

breaking the world record at the 2016 Olympics. Her 

parents watched from the audience, Craven from his 

computer at home and her teammates from a TV feed 

at the natatorium as MacNeil went into the turn in 

the middle of the pack. Then, she turned on the jets — 

utilizing her underwaters and back-half speed to great 

effect, just the way she and Bishop planned — to beat 

Sjöstrom and win the championship.

The Canadian flag went up and “O Canada” played. 

It was MacNeil’s coronation moment — and one that 

removed her cloak of anonymity.

MacNeil went into the 2020 season knowing full 

well that it was an Olympic year, and that she was 

potentially on track to make the Canadian team. She 

briefly considered taking a redshirt year to train, but 

ultimately decided against it. 

Taking the year off would have meant returning 

home to Canada. That, in turn, would mean much 

more intense training sessions, without the fun of Big 

Ten meets to break them up. It would mean constant 

media requests, autograph signings, photos. It would 

mean the eyes of a country, pinned on her, and all the 

pressure that came with that.

For MacNeil, the decision to return to Michigan 

was easy because it allowed her to keep a lower profile. 

With the Wolverines, she can take her training one big 

event at a time and focus on swimming in one of the 

best conferences in the country before worrying about 

the all-consuming potential of Trials or the Olympics. 

In late February — before the world was flipped 

on its head due to the COVID-19 outbreak — MacNeil 

returned from Big Tens with two big meets coming 

up. First, NCAA Championships were set to begin 

March 18. (They have since been canceled.) Canadian 

Olympic Trials were scheduled to start March 30, just 

nine days after NCAAs were supposed to end. (They 

have since been postponed indefinitely, and it has yet 

to be determined if they will be moved to a later date.) 

One look into Bishop’s office, and it was clear which of 

the two MacNeil was more focused on.

Listed on a whiteboard were four times, a list of 

teams and a drawing of a medal. They were Michigan’s 

target splits for the 200-yard medley relay, in which 

MacNeil swam the first leg. MacNeil sorely wants to 

win an NCAA Championship, and she wants to win 

one with her team. As she trained, NCAAs were her 

main focus. Thoughts of Trials and potentially the 

Olympics would come later. That’s why, when Bishop 

reminds MacNeil how many days there are until 

Tokyo or tries to gameplan for how to beat Sjöstrom a 

second time, MacNeil will always remind him: “I still 

gotta make the Canadian team!”

The regimented, race-by-race nature of MacNeil’s 

training has helped take the pressure off. So has the 

fact that she’s in a different country, competing for a 

team of her own. Most professional swimmers only 

have one thing to focus on: international competition. 

MacNeil has that, but she also has college races every 

week. She has Big Tens and NCAAs. She has a team 

around her, one she desperately wants to help win a 

team championship.

The few times she does go back home, she’s 

showered with recognition. Not to the point of being 

overwhelmed — just enough to give her confidence 

that she can accomplish whatever she wants.

“I kinda like to say I’m hiding out down here,” 

MacNeil said. “Which is kinda nice.”

***

At meets, MacNeil blends in with the rest of her 

teammates. All of them wear the same blue one-

piece swimsuit with the block ‘M’ on the chest. She 

stays loose by doing TikTok dances on the pool deck 

and having friendly competitions with the other 

swimmers. As a sprinter, when she dives into the 

water, all eyes are on her for less than a minute. Then, 

it’s a teammate’s turn.

In Canada, every meet is all about her — Maggie 

MacNeil, world champion, Olympic hopeful. At 

Michigan, it doesn’t matter who’s swimming as long 

as the winner wears maize and blue. In Canada, she’s 

expected to meet with young swimmers who idolize 

her and provide publicity for Swimming Canada. At 

Michigan, it would be a surprise if someone asked for 

an autograph because so few classmates know who she 

is.

“I’m not feeling as stressed as I should be about 

Trials and the Olympics,” MacNeil said. “ ... I’m really 

able to focus on swimming when I’m at the pool and 

be able to focus on my studies and really have the 

two connected just because I wouldn’t be recognized 

unless I’m at an event.”

The rigors of an NCAA program aren’t right 

for every international swimmer. But for MacNeil, 

more on her plate means a clearer head and a better 

performance. The anonymity the Wolverines have 

granted her has enabled her to develop into a swimmer 

that may just have to call her mom’s bluff.

Although McNair was wrong about the level her 

daughter would rise to, she knows there are much 

worse things that could happen than MacNeil getting 

an Olympic rings tattoo. Beside, she’s seen first-hand 

the way Michigan has supported MacNeil, and she’ll 

take that every single time.

“You know what?” she says. “I don’t think I’ve ever 

seen Maggie happier than I have the past couple of 

years.”

For Maggie MacNeil,

anonymity is a secret weapon

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

University of Michigan President Mark 

Schlissel emailed an announcement at 

4:16pm Wednesday, March 11 saying, most 

notably, that class would be canceled for 

the following two days and would resume 

on Monday via online platforms. The novel 

coronavirus had stopped time. 

We are all experiencing the world in a 

dimension that we have never before. All 

museums, movie theaters, performance 

venues, sporting events, gyms, recreation 

centers, spas, casinos, restaurants, bars, 

cafes, libraries and coffee shops are closed 

indefinitely, until further notice.

This vocabulary has a sense of finality. 

Countless store fronts don signage saying 

they will be closed indefinitely. I know in 

my mind it does not mean forever, but an 

unspecified period of time, yet I’m finding 

it difficult to see beyond the horizon of this 

pandemic.

While it is in the interest of the public 

health to close such a sweeping category of 

places, the demands of public health and the 

demands of cultural well-being are working 

at odds with each other. We go to these places 

for a sense of community, belonging, identity, 

pattern, routine and human interaction. 

These demands of cultural well-being make 

us feel human. They have been stripped, 

until further notice. No social, cultural or 

any others gatherings will materialize in the 

coming weeks, perhaps months. 

We now must approach this new world 

in a way that will be productive, rather than 

fearful. While our daily lives have been so 

holistically interrupted, it is in service of 

social 
distancing. 
These 
unprecedented 

directives from not only the university 

administration and our state Governor 

Gretchen Whitmer, but the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention, are to create 

space not just between ourselves, but for those 

who are more vulnerable, more susceptible to 

the virus.

While most of us living in Ann Arbor are 

young and healthy, many of us are only one 

or two connections away from the vulnerable 

population. An aging grandparent. A diabetic. 

Someone with lung or heart disease. Being 

aware of our personal health and actions 

validates that public health is everyone’s 

responsibility; how we all choose to behave 

impacts all others’ health. 

Between caution and panic

However we choose to exist in space over 

the next few weeks will decide how we will 

be allowed to exist for the next many months.

The world is truly very scary right now 

and it will continue to be for a while. This is 

unprecedented; no one has all the answers we 

wish for. Professors must learn new mediums 

and techniques previously never necessary, 

while students must do the same and are not 

expected to be experts at this either. It comes 

at a strange time as many are not only trying 

to finish the school year, but also their college 

careers. Two days after President Schlissel’s 

initial announcement, he sent another 

deeming all commencement ceremonies 

canceled. 

Since we are all facing such extreme 

circumstances, it is even more vital we look 

out for each other. Not only to slow the spread 

of the virus, but to consider the oncoming 

economic impact on those who may not be 

able to overcome it. The pandemic has already 

brought every crack in our systems to light; 

homelessness, healthcare, debt, income and 

savings, childcare, workers’ rights, to name a 

few. The virus is begging to exacerbate every 

single one of them.

It is already evident how this virus is 

instilling fear and panic in our community. 

The panic felt is triggering a need for survival. 

Which in turn, is triggering overconsumption 

and hoarding of goods such as toilet paper, 

isopropyl alcohol, masks, thermometers, 

hand sanitizer, gloves and disinfectant wipes.

It felt near apocalyptic as I walked into 

Walgreens to photograph the status of the 

store and it’s contents. Now as I practice 

social distancing, I stay inside my apartment 

and look out my window to see lone people 

holding a few plastic grocery bags passing 

each other like ships in the night.

In the wake of university housing dining 

halls offering take-out only, many students 

are packing up their things and moving back 

to their permanent residences, whether that 

is somewhere else in Michigan, the country 

or across the world. The infamous blue bins 

can now be seen being wheeled down streets, 

a whole two months early accompanied by 

cars packed to the brim.

Instead of panic, fear, suspicion, and self 

interest, we must turn to reason, rationale, 

and patience as we adapt to new ways of 

existing in this reality. Even though it is an 

unsettling, lonely time, take care of yourselves 

and take care of each other. 

The Ann Arbor Farmers Market remains quiet during times of social isolation and self-quarantine.

Literati Bookstore temporarily closes its doors and sticks to online orders due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Ann 

Walgreens experiences a shortage of essentials, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer, during the COVID-19 pan-
demic in Ann Arbor.

The University of Michigan closes the UMMA, the campus art museum, in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Several stores, restaurants and University of Michigan buildings close in accordance to social distancing to minimize the spread of COVID-19 throughout Ann Arbor.

Hello readers. I hope that you are well, 

that your hands are washed and that your 

thoughts remain calm. I’ve had this B-Side 

in my calendar for over a month. I am so 

excited that it’s finally here. I remember 

the day I put it in my calendar. I wrote 

down when the articles would be due, 

when they would go to production here 

in the newsroom and the date they’d be 

published. Like most things in my calendar, 

I wrote them with certainty. I envisioned 

the future through the truth of the present. 

Most of us do this, and we 

usually don’t notice it. We 

think about time through 

a unidirectional arrow of 

past, present and future that 

continues at a steady rate of 

60 seconds per minute. But 

time is fickle: Living through 

the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

teaches us this. Time can 

speed and slow. One minute 

can be vastly more important 

than the next, or they could all be rendered 

useless in the following hour. 

As I float in the current of the 

coronavirus’s impact on our 

world, it seems time has 

completely stopped. Yet, in 

the same moment, it also 

seems like time is moving 

faster than ever. I didn’t 

consider any of this when I 

chose “time” as the theme of 

my B-side. I thought about 

clocks, 
and 
rhythm 
and 

even considered the power 

of suspense. But I did not 

consider the very essence of time — its 

unpredictability and vagueness. 

The past can change the future and the 

future will alter the past. The present is a 

mixture of them both. It is a non-static idea 

that changes person-to-person, minute-

to-minute, day-to-day. Time is universal. 

It does not speak a language or hold a 

nationality. Seemingly, then, we all agree 

to understand the un-understandable. 

Laid out in this week’s B-Side are some 

of our writer’s perspectives on time as it 

pertains to art. I encourage you to read 

them all, and then, consider: What is your 

time, what is your art and where will they 

take you next?

The ‘Time’ B-Side: An Introduction

Two hands on a clock. A date in a history book. 

Tiny grains of sand cascading through the waist of 

an hourglass. Time tends to be malleable. Hours 

melt across disciplines, years stretch between facts 

and minutes explode underneath microscopes. Each 

creates a spectrum of worlds within which research 

can happen, helping minds grow. In Ann Arbor, these 

worlds coexist quietly among offices and classrooms 

across the University. I am highlighting a few of them 

today. 

Special thanks to Jatin Dua, Fred Adams, Cindy 

Lustig, Amy Chavasse and Grant Weldon for their 

help with this piece. I sincerely appreciate your 

enthusiasm and flexibility during the transition to 

online classes and other COVID-19 preventative 

measures.

…

LSA professor Jatin Dua doesn’t think of 

time as linear. The past is not directly correlated 

to the present, and the future is a project to 

be actively imagined right now. Dua studies 

anthropology, a discipline he says is interwoven 

with multidimensional uses of time. A century ago, 

the specialty worked to create a “rupture in time,” 

drawing a line between people of the present and 

people of the past as a way to distinguish us from 

them. 

“It’s tied to creating hierarchy,” Dua said, 

“where some people live in the present and others 

— primarily those who are seen as non-Western — 

lived in different times.” The effects of that mindset 

linger today, he added. Discussions surrounding 

development, 
for 
example, 
can 
“presume 

disjunctures in time” by making assumptions about 

the prioritization of modernity. 

More recently, though, anthropology works to 

define how history comes to matter. What do we 

decide gets attention, and when? “This thing that 

we call tradition or culture,” Dua noted, “is always 

shifting.” In this sense, anthropologists work with 

history as a dynamic tool — it’s the context that 

shapes our present, rather than a story that remains 

untouched. 

This mindset changes Dua’s perspective on time 

as a whole, too: “Thinking anthropologically about 

time makes you constantly think about what kinds 

of forgetting is (sic) required to imagine that we are 

different from the past,” he said. It’s easy to create 

notions of progress that can shape the politics of a 

future, “but that’s actually premised on forgetting 

lots of things,” Dua said. 

“What happens when we don’t think of time as 

linear?” he asked. “What are all the things that we 

choose to forget in order to imagine that timelines 

are linear?” 

Dua asks these questions in his own research 

— he studies piracy and trade off the coast of 

Somalia in a community that continues to rely 

on the timeline of monsoon season, even today. 

Their cyclical world shapes trading networks that 

wouldn’t develop elsewhere, yet complications over 

a linear future still linger in Dua’s studies. 

“This idea that in the future ships will be, or 

can be, automated leads to people thinking about 

questions around labor regulations on ships very 

differently,” Dua said. “But then along with this, 

there’s this idea that in the future climate change 

will make oceanic storms and other things 

completely 
unpredictable, 
therefore 
making 

automation not possible. So there are two kinds of 

visions of the future.” 

Both are simultaneously possible and impossible; 

the question becomes what kind of future is being 

imagined, and for whom? 

This leaves Dua and his peers in anthropology 

thinking of the future as a project instead of a 

destination. His mission lies in complicating the 

relationship between the past and the present, 

asking who we place in the past and why. From 

there, Dua wonders how a person’s imagined future 

shapes his or her present and past, creating a braid 

of overlapping definitions, realities and possibilities 

for time at large. 

…

Physics has its own kind of imagination, too. 

Like Dua, LSA professor Fred Adams operates 

under multiple definitions of time, though Adams’s 

tend to be much, much bigger — in fact, they’re of 

galactic scale. 

In an email interview with The Daily, Adams 

wrote that, when studying the stars and planets, 

“there are no temporal surprises.” 60 seconds in 

a minute. 1000 milliseconds in a second. Things 

progress at normal, calculable rates. Time thus 

becomes the backdrop of research — an unchanging 

provider of normalcy. 

In cosmology, the study of the whole universe, 

“time is more interesting,” Adams wrote. “The 

universe is observed to be expanding, and we 

can not only understand its temporal behavior 

in terms of general relativity but we can also 

measure time by the current size of the universe,” 

Adams added. This schism between the current, 

calculable present and the blurred lines of warped 

spacetime in general relativity adds to Adams’s 

list of approaches. He also mentioned quantum 

mechanics, a field that requires a “probabilistic 

description of what happens, or when it happens, so 

that our concept of time changes accordingly.” 

Like in anthropology, Adams’s research relies on 

a proper application of all these definitions. Physics 

and astrophysics require the use of time on a scale 

very different from our everyday understanding. 

To Adams, time shrinks and grows across a radical 

spectrum of consideration. 

Within the Big Bang theory, for example, 

“we must consider time scales as short as 10 -43 

seconds.” That’s one second divided by a number 

with 43 zeros. It’s the smallest piece of time possible 

— a number so miniscule our human brains can 

barely fathom its existence. 

On the other side of things, time grows to 

millions and billions of years when considering the 

average life of an everyday star.

“Physics and astrophysics will continue to 

unfold over time scales that greatly exceed the 

current cosmic age,” Adams wrote, “and we can 

consider astrophysical processes for times as long 

as 10100 years.” That’s a number followed by 100 

zeros; a googol of years. 

Beyond that, though, Adams added that people 

often think of “letting time ‘go to infinity.’” When 

we try to imagine scales of such length, we might 

picture Buzz Lightyear’s animatronic arm lifting 

to the sky as he proclaims “to infinity and beyond!” 

But compared to forever,even a number followed 

by 100 zeros is quite close to zero.

Adams routinely navigates between these 

extremes — his research stretches across a normally 

unfathomable range of seconds, minutes, hours 

and years, a fact he acknowledged leads him to “a 

broader understanding of time.” More specifically, 

this understanding comes from his study of 

variances in actual real time; in other words, while 

Dua might consider the cultural perception of time 

by people between past and present, Adams focuses 

on measurable changes that we can see on the clock. 

This difference “should be taken with a grain (or 

an ocean) of salt,” Adams wrote. Indeed, he is right: 

From the widest of angles, both professors ground 

themselves in the same understanding that time is 

a pliant, ductile tool for research. It morphs based 

on the question and context at hand, yet remains 

the steady backdrop for reflecting, analyzing and 

furthering our understanding of the world before 

us. It’s a mysteriously flexible reality under which 

we can all live, think and grow. 

…

LSA professor Cindy Lustig also studies that 

reality. As a psychologist, she works to explain those 

processes of living, thinking and growing from 

within our own brains. As such, Lustig approaches 

time through both a general environment and a 

point of focus. “We exist in time and it is constantly 

affecting us,” she explained in an email interview 

with The Daily. As we build our existences across 

seconds, hours, days and years, the passage of those 

units also changes our very existence. It’s “mind-

bending,” Lustig wrote. 

As we age, our brains gain the attention 

that’s necessary to acknowledge that influence. 

Especially within milliseconds to seconds, “we 

get better able to focus on time as we move from 

childhood to young adulthood,” Lustig wrote. As 

we gain that understanding, time accrues into 

minutes, then hours, days and years. With age, “the 

same ‘chunk’ of time in absolute terms begins to 

seem smaller and smaller,” Lustig wrote, though 

she added that she’s unsure if that difference has 

to do with real brain changes or a simple shift in 

the amount of time we’ve accumulated to compare 

things to. Either way, the fluid nature of our various 

perceptions serve to reflect the malleability of time 

inside and outside our brains. 

Lustig’s research confirms this fluidity, pushing 

us to question our notions of who’s best at tracking 

time. She studies attention in older adults, which is 

often assumed to be worse than those of younger 

adults. In her experiments, she asks participants 

to focus on time differences displayed across a 

grid that occur over the course of milliseconds. 

“Maintaining that type of attention over several 

minutes is very hard,” Lustig wrote, but “older 

adults are if anything more motivated and focused 

on the task.” When faced with distractions like 

a video playing nearby, though, that same older 

demographic is hurt the most. “So you might say 

their ability to stay focused on time is both intense 

and fragile,” Lustig wrote. It’s an all-or-nothing 

game of focus, permeated by caveats and subtleties 

that deepen Lustig’s interpretation of time overall. 

This complexity of understanding weaves its 

way into our creation of memories, too. “When 

people look back on their lives,” Lustig wrote, “they 

tend to remember the most events from about ages 

18-30.” This might seem connected to preconceived 

notions about the health of a younger mind, but 

Lustig added that this so-called “memory bump” 

is only true for positive memories. When it comes 

to remembering the negative, we have no age 

filter. “It turns out this is at least in part because 

we have cultural scripts for when positive events 

are supposed to happen,” Lustig wrote. We expect 

to build friendships, enter marriages, find careers 

and have children during those years, and our 

brains are affected by such expectations. “No one 

has a designated time when they ‘expect’ to get in 

a car accident,” Lustig wrote. As such, it impacts 

our memory banks outside of the “memory bump,” 

complicating our internal timelines and furthering 

the ocean of interpretations upon which we surf. 

In that case, our memories, and with them our 

ongoing understanding of time, remain influenced 

by minutes and hours as much as they are by our 

mind’s expectations of what we are to do with them.

It’s only been six days since the first 

coronavirus cases were reported in Michigan, 

but it feels like an eternity has passed. My heart 

sinks every time I see another student moving 

out of their dorm, lugging mattress pads and 

portable fans across the street to waiting cars. 

I’ve temporarily moved back home myself and 

visited Ann Arbor earlier this week to see a ghost 

town. Empty parking spots were scattered all 

along South University that should’ve been filled 

with cars at 1 p.m. on a Monday. I think back to 

the frenzy of the Bernie rally in the Diag last 

Sunday, or the dread with which I returned to 

classes after spring break, and wish my life still 

looked like that.

Amid all the adjustment, I do recognize my 

privileges; I have a loving family to return home 

to and wonderful friends to support me. Even 

so, it’s important to recognize that the emotions 

students are feeling during this turbulent time 

are valid. Social distancing can feel isolating and 

virtual platforms are sometimes a poor substitute. 

I’ve already been invited to two “FaceTime 

parties,” neither of which I participated in, 

suspecting they would instead be more endless 

conversations about the coronavirus. I’ll talk, but 

about anything other than that.

One common thread of advice I’ve gotten from 

my friends and mentors is that “everything will 

be OK.” “We’ll get through this,” my professor 

said during my first BlueJeans class on Monday. 

Which made me wonder, is the passage of 

time enough for us to overcome the events of 

the last couple of months? From an infectious 

disease standpoint, yes, though projections 

from the Center for Disease Control show that 

the spread of coronavirus will probably get 

worse before it gets better. But from a healing 

perspective, how long will it take to throw off the 

emotional baggage coronavirus has brought to 

communities? How long before the xenophobia 

and paranoia die down? 

Which brings me to my central question: Does 

time heal trauma? After this crisis has blown 

over, I believe we will be able to safely say the 

coronavirus classifies as a form of community 

trauma. This pandemic has the potential to 

inform the way we see the world for decades to 

come. As much as we like to believe otherwise, 

healing involves much more than just the passing 

of time.

Part of the reason time can’t “cure” healing is 

that healing has an incredibly fluid definition to 

begin with — a simple Google search will show 

you as much. I constantly hear from friends and 

family that “time numbs pain.” Before writing 

this, I’d assumed that the passage of time almost 

informed healing and was an integral part of it. 

Recognizing my gaps of knowledge in the field 

of healing, I caught up with two experts to hear 

their insights.

“Healing is to never forget what has happened,” 

said Laura Monschau, an embedded psychologist 

with Counseling and Psychological Services at 

the University of Michigan’s Rackham Graduate 

School. Monschau has served as a psychologist 

at the University for over 20 years, including 

seven spent at the Sexual Assault Prevention 

and Awareness Center (SAPAC). “The healing 

journey is both how to put a foot into the past and 

feel what was unendurable at the time, and also 

bring it forward into the future,” Monschau said. 

Listening to Monschau made me realize I’d 

always thought of healing as a necessary step, 

an inevitable hurdle to be crossed, instead of 

an ongoing way to incorporate trauma into my 

being. In Monschau’s view, healing is less an 

endpoint and more a lifelong process. Trauma 

patients rarely feel as though they are suddenly 

healed. This feeling is universal — we can be 

reminded of our past at any moment, and thus 

have to learn to live with it, accepting it as a part 

of us and shaping our life around it. 

Monschau draws many of her perspectives 

from Judith Herman, a feminist and social 

justice-oriented psychologist who’s 1992 book 

“Trauma and Recovery” offers a three-tiered 

view of healing. Herman’s last stage involves 

integrating the trauma into one’s being and 

moving forward. If this isn’t realized, no amount 

of time will help. 

Barbara Niess-May, executive director of 

SafeHouse, a sexual assault and domestic abuse 

shelter in Ann Arbor, thinks of healing in a 

different light. “First, survivors need to be safe,” 

Niess-May said. For some, this safety can be hard 

to come by. SafeHouse handles over 6,000 cases 

of sexual and domestic abuse every year, and 

often the most difficult leap is making survivors 

feel secure while understanding that safety won’t 

necessarily assuage their memories. 

“When they’re ready to talk about it, people 

don’t believe them,” Niess-May said. The 

#MeToo era has helped in this respect, and as 

more women feel comfortable bringing their 

allegations forward, campaigns like Start by 

Believing urge us to listen to survivors rather 

than doubt their stories. 

Regardless of what healing constitutes, both 

Monschau and Niess-May agree that time 

isn’t the end-all cure. Time has the capacity to 

change the way we see events — for example, 

that breakup two years ago probably doesn’t 

have the same sting now as it did then — but 

rarely is it the solution. According to a 2016 study 

by psychologists at Arizona State University, 

creating expectations for when someone should 

be “healed” is usually not helpful and a poor 

heuristic to follow. Monschau stressed the 

importance of honoring everyone’s “trajectories 

of resilience” in their individual journey toward 

healing. “It can’t be rushed,” Monschau said. “It’s 

a lifetime journey of reintegration.” 

Time can also alter the way we see traumatic 

events by drawing us out of linear time. We’ve 

been trained to think of time in a linear sense, 

progressing from one scheduled event to 

another, morning to night, but a trauma-riddled 

brain doesn’t see events as a continuous string. 

“There’s a liminality to time. You can feel like 

you’re in linear, everyday time, and suddenly 

you’re pulled,” Monschau said. Remembering 

a traumatic event can make time slow down, 

and this transitory time can make us feel like 

we’re not in the past or present, but somewhere 

in-between. Think back to a pivotal moment in 

your life, and chances are you remember it in 

bursts of memory. In a car crash last summer, I 

remember the crunching sound of metal and the 

feeling of my heart dropping somewhere beyond 

my stomach, but my memories of immediately 

before and after the crash are hazy. 

This pull away from linear time isn’t exclusive 

to the traumatic event alone. Superficial 

everyday events can serve as triggers and 

remind us of our trauma. Niess-May believes 

this is especially damaging for survivors. “Your 

brain can train you to think normal situations 

are dangerous,” said Niess-May. Niess-May has 

worked with many survivors over her near two 

decades as SafeHouse Executive Director, some 

who remember sensory details like the song that 

played in the background during their assault, 

even years later.

Niess-May, a survivor of sexual assault herself, 

is still reminded of the life-changing event 30 

years later. “There are days when I feel like I’m 

good,” Niess-May said, “But other days when 

I’m like wow, that really reminded me of what 

happened.”

If time doesn’t necessarily facilitate healing, 

I wondered if the opposite was true: Could time 

hurt the healing process? Maybe. In extreme 

cases, Monschau said, “... time can almost seal 

the trauma in.” Unable to cope with trauma in 

their past, people may get stuck in a repetitive 

cycle of remembrance sometimes linked to social 

isolation. More commonly, trauma may remain 

underground while life flies by, but reappear 

suddenly and intensely. In this way, time can 

give you the false illusion of forgetting while 

never truly letting you escape. Post-traumatic 

stress syndrome (PTSS) and post-traumatic 

stress disorder (PTSD) can be manifestations of 

this trauma kinesthetically locked in the body, 

like a caged animal unable to escape. It’s less 

about diverting your attention until the trauma 

doesn’t hit with the same ferocity and more 

about understanding that the trauma may never 

completely leave you.

The power of time in the current age of COVID-19

NINA MOLINA
Daily Arts Writer

Time is an active friend. It skips, flies, 

races and slows. It’s spent and wasted. It’s 

on our hands and walls and microwaves. In 

moments of joy, we never have enough of it.. 

And, in a few indelible moments in our lives, 

time holds its breath and stands completely 

still.

Last Wednesday afternoon, I sat with 

my friends at a booth in the Dana Building, 

laptops burning our eyes, only glancing 

up for groans about MSU closing before 

us. I thought I wanted a week off, even 

two. When the announcement popped up 

in my friend’s Twitter feed, though, time 

indefinitely ceased its ever-forward march. 

Everyone at that table was a transfer 

student 
I 
met 
through 
serendipitous 

circumstances — a transfer tour of Hatcher 

in August, Artscapade, a transfer dinner 

event, a friend of a friend at a party. We all 

carved spaces and homes for ourselves here 

after everyone else. We knew not to ask too 

many questions of the “before,” all being 

from other colleges or breaks from college. 

For the first time in a while, we had built a 

community we loved. In an instant, that new 

life crumbled. My heart dropped through 

the cloth-covered couch and onto the floor. 

At a nearby table, a boy threw a bunch of 

paper into the air in either frustration or 

relief. 

Whenever I am in doubt or confused 

of what to make of the world, I run to the 

Oxford 
English 
Dictorionary’s 
online 

database. This moment was no different. 

If defined as a verb, to “time” is “To befall, 

to happen.” When the coronavirus became 

real, it fell over our table of friends like a 

blanket of virgin snow, silent and eerie. We 

looked at each other and I tried to choose 

a single emotion. I tried to pluck something 

from my turning mind and racing heart. I 

couldn’t pin down anything, so I settled on 

having everyone over at my place one last 

time. 

That night, we crowded around the TV 

in my living room, news headlines flashing 

every few minutes. I lit a scented candle, 

a meager attempt at diffusing the anxiety 

palpable in the silences of our conversation. 

A reporter’s voice boomed around the 

apartment walls as we ate the cassava 

cake I had baked. It felt as though we were 

plopped down into a new reality, a new era 

of existence. 

The OED’s 3a. definition of “time” reads 

as “a period in the existence or history of 

the world; an age, an era.” Growing up, I was 

told that everyone remembered where they 

were on 9/11. My older brother remembers 

kneeling in front of our TV, staring at the 

towers crumbling like Legos while my 

mother frantically dialed our family in New 

York. 

I think we’ll remember when COVID-19 

became real, all of us scrambling to figure 

out how something could change our lives 

so fast. Just as 2001 ushered in the era 

defined by survellience, war and terrorism, 

2020’s coronavirus has altered public 

consciousness permenantly, claiming a new 

time in our lives. 

In true Shakespearean tragedy-worthy 

irony, my English class’s unit on public 

poetry and health started last week. We 

are reading Anne Boyer’s 2019 poetic 

memoir “The Undying” about her breast 

cancer diagnosis, how she grappled with 

her rearranged reality, and its aftershocks 

in politics. Boyer writes, “if that suffering 

does not meet sufficient language, those 

who endure that suffering must come 

together to invent it.” Just as she endured a 

reordering of language of her new reality of 

“sonograms,” “imaging,” and the word “ill,” 

we too have a new language of our time 

filled with “respiratory,” “coronavirus,” 

“social distancing,” “quarantining” and 

“generational war.” 

Though some of us are enduring the same 

isolation as Boyer, there is, and will always 

be, time. Time to make TikToks with our 

siblings stuck in the house with us. Time 

to sit and watch that new series on Netflix 

(between our BlueJeans lectures of course). 

Time to realize that loneliness and isolation 

caused by a public health crisis is simply a 

concept, a construction that can be pushed 

aside for taking the time to realize the 

humanity of those closest to us.

I’m terrible at keeping journals. I admire 

their purpose, but I can never keep up with 

the commitment. I always stop to doodle and 

quickly get sick of hearing myself talk about 

the same things over and over.

Despite the distracting nature, I’m still 

fascinated by the concept of tracking growth 

over time. Some of my favorite artworks are 

those that do exactly that – without a clear 

end goal. Instead of developing an art piece 

based on an argument the artist wants to 

make, these works develop a framework for 

creating and let time take the reigns. Maybe 

the piece does make an argument, but it 

appears organically as the work incrementally 

changes. It’s not the driving force. It’s time-

based, but instead of the “time as a medium” 

mindset of other “time-based” art forms like 

film or performance, this type of work invites 

the force of time to be a co-artist.

Bre Boersma’s 2018 Sunrise Trek project is 

a great example of this. Every morning for a 

summer, Boersma woke up at 5:45 a.m., took 

a picture of the sunrise and created a color 

palette of it. The framework is simple, but 

the results are intriguing. You can take a lot 

of conclusions from this work if you want – 

maybe we should wake up earlier, maybe we 

should appreciate sunrises more, but it’s not 

about the conclusions. It’s about the process of 

letting forces beyond our control drive what 

we make.

There’s a concept that information designer 

Giorgia Lupi calls “data humanism,” which 

champions the collection and visualization 

of subjective, complex and personal data. She 

makes highly rendered, sprawling depictions 

of gathered information that take time to 

interpret. Every one of Lupi’s graphs needs a 

key. Her infographics are beautiful, yes, but 

their delight goes beyond aesthetics. They’re a 

way of telling a story by inviting the listener to 

look closely and put together the pieces.

But not just any story. It’s always a 

personal story, as benign as showing every 

instance Lupi looked at a clock in a day and 

as emotionally heavy as representing the 

daily experiences of a child with a serious 

illness. Lupi knows and embraces the fact that 

these works cannot help but be subjective. 

That’s what communication is: a flawed 

interpretation and subsequent representation 

of a subject. We unavoidably filter everything 

we say, show, write and express through our 

own viewpoints. That’s what art is, too.

At a young age, I switched from keeping 

journals to sketchbooks. I’ve got piles of them 

at home, going back to when I was seven 

or eight years old. A lot of the sketches are 

embarrassing to look at now, and I probably 

won’t ever show them to anyone else. But 

I’m glad I kept them. It’s a record of change 

that I never could have predicted, both in 

the development of artistic skills and the 

development of my own personality. 

I can track my growth over time, from 

drawing princesses as a child up through my 

emo comic book phase as a teenager. I can 

look through these drawings and pinpoint the 

moment I decided to go to art school. I have 

nearly 50 sketches of the same friend over the 

course of four years, showcasing not only my 

friend’s rapidly-changing haircuts, but the 

way our friendship changed over time.

The University of Michigan Museum of Art 

has a piece by Felix Gonzalez-Torres called 

“Untitled (March 5th) #2” which consists of 

two lightbulbs, cords intertwined, affixed to a 

wall. Either of the lightbulbs can go out at any 

time. One of them will always go out before the 

other, but the artist and the museum have no 

control over when that happens. It’s a simple 

but profound framework where the outcome 

is determined by time.

Gonzalez-Torres 
made 
this 
piece 
in 

response to the AIDS crisis after the 1991 

diagnosis of his lover, Ross Laycock. It’s one 

of many lightbulb pieces he made in the years 

after, a way to deal with ideas of connection 

and mortality in a time of hurt and uncertainty.

Right now, we’re also living through a 

time of uncertainty. No one knows exactly 

how our days are going to progress or how 

life will change. It’s set a lot of people’s lives 

and art goals into limbo – canceled shows 

and lack of access to materials and equipment 

can be a major setback for professional and 

amateur artists alike. But rather than be 

consumed with frustration at the roadblocks 

to other projects, there’s another option: Start 

something new.

You don’t have to set up a time-consuming, 

complex framework. You don’t have to know 

how or when you’re going to end it. There’s 

something comforting about starting an art 

project without planning the finish. It means 

accepting that you don’t have total control 

over what happens next. 

As someone who revels in careful routine 

and planning, it can be worrisome to give up 

any control. But you can still set parameters 

for yourself. Maybe you photograph all of 

your daily meals. Maybe you record yourself 

playing a song every day. Maybe you make 

color swatches based on your outfits. Maybe 

you stick with a tried-and-true journal. 

Maybe, if you’re like me, you just set aside 

daily time to sketch.

So if you’re stuck in limbo, worrying about 

the future, try starting a routine art practice. 

Let time work with you, and see what happens 

next.

As weird as it may sound, time travel 

is a common topic of conversation in my 

family. This is mostly because my sister 

just doesn’t understand it. Any time we 

watch a time travel movie, we end up 

spending hours discussing the logistics 

behind the warped chronology that the 

characters inevitably go through, and 

we usually end up more confused than 

we began. In our terms, to accomplish 

time travel correctly, there have to be 

repercussions for all of the character’s 

actions without unresolved or confusing 

gaps in the timeline. While I am by no 

means an expert in this topic, I’d like to 

think that I do know a little bit about time 

travel in movies, at least enough to explain 

which movies make sense and which ones 

don’t.

I’ll 
start 
with 
one 
that 
doesn’t: 

“Avengers: Endgame.” In the simplest 

of terms, the movie revolves around the 

Avengers venturing into the past to get the 

Infinity Stones that control the universe. 

But it isn’t exactly a simple concept. The 

directors of the film, Joe and Anthony 

Russo (“Captain America: The Winter 

Soldier”), pioneered an entirely new way of 

time travel. Their new method insinuated 

that any change a character made to the 

past didn’t affect their original future; 

rather, it affected a new future. What does 

that mean? To be honest, I’m not sure 

anyone really knows. The best way that I 

could understand it was that any time you 

go back in time and change something, 

you create a new alternate reality. 

This is a fine concept, I suppose, but 

only if it’s consistent … and it isn’t. For 

one thing, if Steve Rogers (Chris Evans, 

“Knives Out”) goes back in time and 

lives a life with Peggy (Hayley Atwell, 

“Christopher Robin”) — which he does 

— wouldn’t that then create an alternate 

reality, or an alternate ‘future’? So how 

does Old Man Steve show up in the 

Avengers’ reality, having lived a life with 

Peggy? According to the Russo brothers’s 

rules, he shouldn’t be able to. Also, when 

Steve and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr, 

“Iron Man”) go back to the ’70s to retrieve 

the Tesseract and Pym Particles, how 

is Tony’s father Howard (John Slattery, 

“Churchill”) an old man when Peggy, who 

is presumably around the same age as him, 

appears virtually the same thirty years 

after we last saw her? Again, it doesn’t 

make sense. I’ll never really forgive the 

Russo Brothers for messing with my mind 

the way they did with “Endgame.”

“Back to the Future” remains one of the 

most iconic examples of time travel and 

does it more correctly than “Endgame” 

does, but plenty of concepts in that film 

remain difficult to swallow, continuity-

wise. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, “The 

Frighteners”) accidentally goes back in 

time, interrupts his parents’ meeting and 

has to hurry to reintroduce them to ensure 

that he exists in the future. But how do 

Marty’s parents and Biff (Thomas Wilson, 

“The Heat”) not recognize ‘Calvin Klein’ 

when Marty himself grows up to look just 

like him? Shouldn’t they all remember 

the kid that had such a huge impact on 

their lives? After all, ‘Calvin’ helped 

George McFly (Crispin Glover, “Hot Tub 

Time Machine”) and Lorraine Banes 

(Lea Thompson, “Howard the Duck”) get 

together while ruining Biff’s car with 

manure in the process. However, I will 

admit that this film did a pretty good job 

with time travel, especially considering 

the fact that it was such a new idea in the 

’80s. Most of the time travel continuity 

problems in the “Back to the Future” 

franchise stem from the fact that almost 

all the time travelling that Marty and 

Doc do involves either past renditions of 

themselves or the past versions of people 

that they know, thus teaching me that if 

anyone ever does decide to time travel, 

they should not meddle with events their 

ancestors were a part of. In fact, if time 

travel ever does exist, it should only be 

used to passively observe history. 

This brings me to my final example 

of time travel, the movie that does it the 

best … “Mr. Peabody and Sherman.” A lot 

of people might overlook this film due to 

the fact that it’s categorized as a children’s 

movie, but not only is this probably the only 

movie I’ve ever seen that has done time 

travel correctly, it’s also just an awesome, 

entertaining film. Mr. Peabody, voiced by 

Ty Burrell (“Modern Family”), and his son 

Sherman, voiced by Max Charles (“The 

Angry Birds Movie”), use Mr. Peabody’s 

invention, the WABAC Machine, to time 

travel to important historical events to 

teach Sherman about history. This movie 

shows that there are repercussions to time 

travel that go beyond just getting stuck in 

the past, like what happens to Marty. You 

could destroy the entire universe with 

time travel. This is why, in all honesty, 

time travel should just never, ever exist. 

There are too many variables and too 

many ways to mess up everything. And 

there is, unfortunately, no Mr. Peabody 

in the real world to save us all when we 

inevitably screw everything up when we 

try to time travel.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In 10th grade English, as our final book 

of the year, my class cracked open Kurt 

Vonnegut’s 1969 novel “Slaughterhouse-

Five.” After a grueling year of classics 

like “Gulliver’s Travels,” “All Quiet on 

the Western Front” and “The Canterbury 

Tales,” I assumed that “Slaughterhouse-

Five” would be more of the same long-

winded stories that had populated our 

classes up to that point. The title reminded 

me of “Animal Farm” and filled me with 

expectations of complex allegories or 

tedious legends from a slaughterhouse. 

But as I read the first few chapters, I was 

surprised to find that “Slaughterhouse-

Five” was, well, good.

Now in college, I remember very few 

things from that first time I read Vonnegut’s 

novel. I remember something about aliens 

and a celebrity named Montana. I remember 

descriptions of the Dresden firebombing, 

which at the time I didn’t realize was a 

true historical event. Most importantly, I 

remember a description of an idea of time, one 

that may have come from the book itself or 

possibly my teacher attempting to explain this 

complex idea. The way to think of the timeline 

of someone’s life, according to Vonnegut’s 

ideas and my teacher’s careful explanation, 

is not as a straight line, as we tend to think, 

but similar to a book. When you hold a book in 

your hands, you hold the entire story, start to 

finish; every event in the book has already been 

written. While we are logically programmed 

to read the book from start to end, this is not 

the only way to experience its events. You can 

open the book to any page, any time in the 

story and you will be able to experience that 

event even if it is done out of order. This is the 

idea of time as a fourth dimension, beyond the 

three dimensions of space.

Vonnegut’s novel itself is utterly perplexing 

in many ways. “Slaughterhouse-Five” is 

partially first-person, narrated by a stand-

in for Vonnegut, and partially third-person, 

with a grand sense of omniscience. In the 

introduction, the narrator tells you exactly 

how the book will begin (“Listen: Billy Pilgrim 

has come unstuck in time.”) and exactly how 

it will end (“Poo-tee-weet?”). It’s a novel 

impossible to place into a single genre, filled 

with war and aliens and inherent human 

grief. It toes a line between historical fiction 

and science fiction that few authors have 

accomplished. But what is most perplexing is 

the way that “Slaughterhouse-Five” proposes 

the concept of time, a proposal that forever 

changed the way I thought about time.

“Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in 

time,” the narrator tells us at the beginning of 

the first chapter. Billy’s journey throughout 

the novel is not linear, but spastic, bouncing 

between events in his life without rhyme or 

reason. These jumps tend to be triggered at 

particularly desperate or traumatic moments 

and often result in skipping full decades. This 

is connected to Billy’s experience as a soldier 

in Dresden, Germany, where he survives being 

a prisoner-of-war as well as the destructive 

firebombing of Dresden in 1945. After the war, 

Billy is hospitalized for PTSD; it’s around this 

time that he starts becoming unstuck, and the 

two things are clearly linked.

Even if being unstuck is the product of a 

psychiatric disorder, it’s still fascinating to 

consider. Despite his position in time, Billy 

also believes that he was abducted by the 

Tralfamadorians, an alien race that keeps him 

in a zoo. Importantly, the Tralfamadorians 

see in four dimensions; rather than the three 

dimensions of space that humans remain 

limited to understanding, the Tralfamadorians 

see our three dimensions plus time. According 

to the Narrator, this means that they view the 

idea of life and death differently: “When a 

Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is 

that the dead person is in bad condition in that 

particular moment, but that the same person 

is just fine in plenty of other moments.” This 

view of time means that one can view their life 

much more holistically; rather than focus on 

the loss of one moment, the Tralfamadorians 

find the life in previous moments. This ties to 

the common Tralfamadorian saying: “So it 

goes.” What has happened has happened, and 

what is going to happen will; so it goes.

Films, books and other media dealing 

with time travel often try to explore the idea 

of changing the past or the future. Plotlines 

are based around acting on questions like 

“What would I have done differently?” and 

“How do I prevent this from happening?” 

I’ve sometimes heard questions like “would 

you kill baby Hitler” thrown around, often 

jokingly and with little regard for the reality 

of the space-time continuum. In Vonnegut’s 

proposed version of time, however, these 

questions are irrelevant. Changing the past 

means that this version of the future would 

not exist, and if we’ve learned anything from 

Disney Channel’s “That’s So Raven,” it’s that 

trying to change the future usually results in 

making it happen.

I should clarify that I don’t believe this 

means we don’t have free will, nor that we 

should believe that actions don’t have real 

consequences. In the novel, Billy becomes 

fatalistic, believing that all events and actions 

come down to destiny. I don’t agree. Instead, 

it’s about trying to find a balance in between 

these ideas — finding a way to live in the 

moment without dwelling on a past or a future 

over which you have no control. It’s the idea of 

viewing time not just as a long line stretching 

somewhere into the future, but into something 

a bit more elastic in both directions.

Vonnegut’s concept of time

I tie “Interstellar” to the concept of time 

because of how rooted it is to a specific time in 

my life. I was 18 years old when I first watched 

the movie in my AP Literature and Composition 

class. I knew nothing of it other than that it 

starred Matthew McConaughey and came out 

in 2014 — my freshman year of high school. 

When we watched it, I was a month shy of 

graduating. I can’t tell you the run time, or 

at what point I truly felt myself reeled in, but 

I bawled my eyes out and forgot about the 

assignment all together. 

I am currently 21 years old and the same still 

stands: I will, without a doubt, bawl my eyes out 

to “Interstellar,” though it doesn’t feel the same 

way it did three years ago. I don’t know if this 

is a cliche or not, but the older I get, the more it 

dawns on me how stagnant 

artwork itself can be while 

its meaning is personal 

and ever-evolving. I think 

that’s because we are ever-

evolving — which brings me 

back to the movie in question. 

The running theme (in the 

most figurative sense) of 

the movie is time — running 

time, the physics of time and 

lost time. The movie takes 

place in a mid-21st century 

America plagued by blights 

and dust storms. Culture 

has regressed into a post-

truth society in which the 

younger generation is taught 

that events and ideas like 

the moon landing and space 

travel are hoaxes. The story 

is told through the lens of 

farmer Joseph Cooper, a 

former NASA pilot. After accidentally tracing 

geographic coordinates to a secret NASA 

facility, Cooper is recruited to pilot Endurance, 

a team of volunteers tasked with finding an 

alternative earth. Alongside this ambition are 

grave risks, namely the time variance between 

space travel that occurs far more rapidly than 

that of Earth’s. 

There’s a moment before Cooper’s ascent to 

space in which his daughter Murph protests his 

departure. Cooper brushes this off by joking 

that he might be back on Earth by the time him 

and Murph are the same age. This joke sours 

by the time Murph reaches his age and he is 

(spoiler) not back. After watching a stream of 

videos that accumulated from his son Donald, 

Cooper watches the 23 years he lost flash before 

his eyes. He gradually moves from embracing 

these moments to crying at the realization that 

his children have grown up without him. Every 

time, I cry as Hans Zimmer’s “Main Theme” for 

“Interstellar” plays in the background, knowing 

what is to come. I lose it once the music stops; 

looking up at the screen before him, Cooper 

finds an adult version of his daughter calling 

him a “bastard,” still visibly upset for his 

leaving. 

I think about this scene a lot because I’ve 

been in Murph’s place. I grew up not seeing 

one of my parents a lot, and this is an anger I 

still wrestle with as an adult. Can a parent truly 

care if they can’t be physically there for you? 

This was my question as a child. I wouldn’t 

say the reasoning for my situation parallels 

that of Murph’s, but it strikes me how much 

my reaction does. Murph’s last memory of her 

father was centered on the anger she felt toward 

him, and these feelings endured into adulthood. 

This is probably something I’m pulling from 

a psychology class I’ve taken at some point, 

but memories feel more tied to emotions than 

they are to actual events. The one thing I am 

certain of is that art means different things to 

different people because we’ve all had different 

experiences. I’m curious 

about how things would 

be different if I were a 

parent rather than a child 

at the time I first watched 

the film. 

I’ve never considered 

“Interstellar” 
profound 

for its plot. For one thing, 

it’s a bit too esoteric for 

my understanding. I don’t 

have much of a knack for 

physics. The plot holes 

are also glaring given the 

complexity of its synopsis. 

But I don’t think this 

demerits the heart and 

brilliance of this film; I 

praise the movie more 

so for its delivery — the 

way it elicits specific 

emotions and navigates 

relationships. 

I discovered this film around the time when 

I first caught on to the link between love and 

time. I spent all of high school in love with a 

friend who wasn’t right for me. Whether or not 

they felt the same way is something that matters 

less and less each day — another attribute of 

time. But when I think back to that person, I can 

only remember her the way I loved her. This is 

the power of love, and “Interstellar” captures 

it well. At the movie’s core is a love story 

between a parent and a child. Cooper spends 

days on an exhibition that ages him beyond his 

comprehension, but he does it out of love and 

emerges out of it still in love with his children. 

Murph is frustrated with her father throughout 

the duration of the film, but it’s also out of love 

and the way her 10-year-old self understood his 

departure. Despite the time and turbulence, 

the one constant of “Interstellar” is love and 

its extensions across different experiences. As 

my understanding of love changes more and 

more with age, I find that I can at least keep 

constant the way I felt in that moment of certain 

experience.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I split this column into three parts 

because I didn’t know how to write 

this last installment. The Daily Arts 

generously allows for the involvement 

of personal narratives as long as they 

surround an event, moment in culture at 

large or a work of art. While wrapping 

the personal around something that can 

qualify as topical can mean the difference 

between a form of journalistic content that 

can be published in a school newspaper 

and creative non-fiction that must be 

made available for public consumption by 

other means, the core of what I’m getting 

at is deeply personal. I see no other way 

to move forward than to make that clear 

from the get go.

Things that are constructed so that 

they are diametrically opposed to one 

another, like God and the Devil, create 

a valley between two extremes that we 

all supposedly occupy. Their respective 

hierarchies serve as a degreed apparatus 

through which we can hold ourselves 

and others accountable. That becomes 

problematic, however, when normative 

functions create a “winning team” in that 

valley located closer to the desirable pole 

than others. Without even beginning to 

address how sin, laws and ailments are 

defined in such a way that favors the 

“normal” and quite literally damns those 

that fall outside of that window, simply 

existing outside of it in any capacity 

can foster a lot of negative feelings 

about oneself. And the thing about those 

normative functions, especially in an 

economic system that’s predicated on 

fear, is that they will continue to multiply 

(and generate revenue) until they can’t be 

supported anymore. 

This isn’t meant to be an after-school 

special surrounding the thinning out 

of the ruling class and consolidation of 

power, nor is it about how none of us 

are perfect and we all have at least that 

in common. In fact, most of the time 

we aren’t interested in what we have in 

common, even if we have more in common 

than not. Human nature, probably out of 

some vestige of natural selection, is all 

about differentiation. What’s valued as 

“normal” is what’s valued as powerful 

in almost every ideological framework. 

“Normal” isn’t a station that encompasses 

the majority, it is a collection of paragons 

that constantly move along value lines that 

serve those in power.

The closer we are in proximity to that 

power, in our appearances, through our 

actions, choices and identities, chosen 

or otherwise, the more likely we are to 

support the systems that uphold how we 

currently define it. In working against 

it, the individual becomes increasingly 

aware of the things that give them power 

and the things that take it away, like a 

Machiavellian push and pull taking place 

between things that may or may not be 

within our control. As we are exposed to 

those dividing lines, what we do with our 

power and our agency to act in relation to it 

becomes an increasingly severe individual 

burden.

I remember looking out of my window 

one night and seeing a pair of red tail 

lights. The presence of a black, demi-

luxury SUV next to a neon-lit sign was 

innocuous enough, but the emptiness 

of the Ann Arbor streets at 3 a.m. lent a 

paranoid air that infiltrated my thoughts 

like a cancer. Earlier that day while 

running an errand, I had hidden an orchid 

mesh bodysuit under an oversized blazer. 

What felt liberating in my apartment, what 

would have been a proud expression at the 

drag show I planned to attend later, was 

squandered while walking in public. Even 

as it was protected by the conservative, 

woolen barrier between signifier and 

signified that I clung to like all hell. I 

remember feeling my skin rub against it as 

I walked, an uncomfortable reminder that 

seeking medical help for my depression 

had resulted in a weight gain. So much of 

what I hope for revolves around being a 

light for others, not necessarily to follow 

but to be able to look at and smile.

Yet, the standards I hold myself to in 

order to be that liberatory force are the 

same ones that hold down so many. I can 

wear lip gloss and have a “walk” as long as 

I can also feel my ribs. I can engage with 

genuine interests of mine that are used to 

paint my community with a broad brush as 

long as my voice remains low. I can fight 

to the nail for my mental health and live 

to talk about it, but I won’t be able to do 

what I feel a call to do until I free myself 

of those chains. I may have internalized 

such bargains as a way of remaining safe, 

as a way of being able to move through 

the world, but the only person standing in 

the way at this point in my life is myself. 

Silly as it may sound, it’s taken a seismic 

cognitive shift to understand that there 

are no silent vehicles watching me in the 

dead of night, waiting to ensnare me with 

their malevolent aura. There are no devils 

or demons lurking around the corner. 

There’s only me, and the beliefs about 

myself that I have to undo in order to truly 

be free. 

Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve felt that 

I carry a curse with me. I’m lucky to know 

where that feeling comes from now, but it 

took me a long time to get to this point. I’ve 

always reviewed each and every thing that 

I do with a fine-toothed comb, all with the 

hopes of wanting to be good, to use my 

privileges in a productive way and to wear 

my queerness with pride so as to inspire 

others. What I didn’t realize until recently 

is that I wasn’t bringing my happiness into 

the equation. The opportunity cost, for 

me, of reviewing myself in the way that 

I have been is my mental well-being. All 

of those little things I would look at, the 

sociopolitical ramifications of every word, 

every nonverbal gesture, every expression, 

every conscious and unconscious action, 

were 
not 
being 
used 
to 
productive 

ends. The relentless self-policing that 

I have undergone (and still face) is not 

something that helps me achieve this goal 

of leveraging my likeness for the common 

good.

It doesn’t help me bring light to others 

in the smallest of interactions. It is a 

hindrance. The internal manifestation of 

the evil I so desperately want to renounce, 

to work against, rears its devilish head 

through this censorship of self. I say this not 

in defense of the kind of blissful ignorance 

that only exists in contexts of privilege. 

I am fully for asking tough questions, for 

doing work to unpack whatever bag of 

bullshit one carries around with them as a 

result of exalting normalcy. What I will no 

longer tolerate is allowing self-criticism 

to take the reins entirely. I will no longer 

allow each and every breath to carry the 

weight of heaven and hell.

Velveteen Dreams: On 

heaven and hell, part three

SAM KREMKE

Daily Style Columnist

On Monday, Mar. 16, Governor Whitmer 

issued an executive order closing all 

Michigan restaurants and bars to slow the 

spread of the coronavirus — an unfortunate 

consequence of the pandemic for what would 

otherwise have been an exciting new time 

for the Ann Arbor food scene. 

Bløm Meadworks, a meadery centered 

around downtown Ann Arbor, is among the 

businesses that are being forced to reduce 

or shut down their operations due to the 

pandemic. However, the true shame is that 

Bløm, like many other restaurants, is unable 

to optimally serve products tailored to the 

frosty harbingers of the spring season. Bløm, 

more so than other bars and restaurants, falls 

under the fickle whims of time’s passage. 

Should they fail to capture the fleeting 

presences of new produce that bloom and 

wither within a span of weeks, Bløm could 

potentially brew an incomplete narrative of 

the year’s capricious seasons.

Mead is an alcohol fermented from 

honey that can range in flavor from the 

piss-poor and overly-sweetened drinks at 

a renaissance fair to a well-balanced, fruit-

forward melomel such as Schramm’s that 

shames all other wines in its wake. While 

Schramm’s nearly exclusively specializes in 

a rich-bodied drink somewhat similar to the 

alcohol content of wine, Bløm specializes in 

“sessionable” meads (drinks to be consumed 

at a leisurely pace in large quantities) more 

akin to the alcohol content of a dry sour ale. 

Like Schramm’s, Bløm frequently features 

melomels — though by no means does Bløm 

specialize in them. In spite of that, Bløm’s 

greatest hits lie within the limited batches 

of brewed melomels that coincide with 

the season. A cherry-lemon mead released 

during late summer 2019 would screech 

with fruity acidity were it not tamed by the 

hints of sweet floral honey — exactly the sort 

of grown-up lemonade that you’ve always 

dreamed of drinking. The black currant 

mead, which was available within the late 

summer to early fall of 2019, emphasized the 

somewhat spicy and tart currant berries — 

a departure from a sweetened spice profile 

that one might find at a meadery such as 

Schramm’s.

Though seasonality throughout the winter 

may seem as if it would empty out Bløm’s 

selections of mead, Bløm compensates 

through an increased focus of ciders — and 

a Christmas-themed mead. For instance, 

though the apricots utilized in the Hopricot 

Cider would normally provide a sweet, 

autumnal tone, the inclusion of hops provides 

an astringency that helps you fight back from 

the chills of early winter — without any of the 

bitterness normally attached to a hop. As a 

follow-up, the Christmas mead’s spicy ginger 

overtones melds with sour cranberries — a 

melding that you suspect would be jarring 

were it not for the background notes of sweet 

honey binding the two together. Bløm, it 

seems, finds its style of mead by utilizing 

honey as a negotiator instead of the main 

event.

But perhaps the greatest mainstay of 

Bløm’s selection lies not with their meads or 

ciders, but with their switchel soda — a soda 

primarily consumed by American farmers 

in the 1800s. This drink is an anomaly — 

not only because of the lack of alcohol, but 

also because of what it highlights. The 

interplay between the honey and fruit 

vinegar is Bløm’s homage to the sweet and 

floral qualities of honey. While Bløm may 

use honey as the great negotiator in many 

of their sessionable meads, the soda takes 

the opposite stance in showcasing honey as 

a star player. Honey, you find, is not afraid to 

shine when it doesn’t have other ingredients 

nearby that need disciplining.

But with Governor Whitmer’s orders 

to shut down all restaurants and bars, it 

would be impossible to continue to drink 

Bløm’s carefully curated drinks on tap. As 

somewhat of a consolation, Bløm offers a 

few of their taps from their previous seasons 

across grocery stores and liquor stores such 

as Plum Market, Blue Front or Whole Foods. 

Most notably you’d find cans of a somewhat 

mediocre Blueberry Maple mead and its 

much tarter but exciting cousin: the Pear 

Ginger cider. Both may be throwbacks to the 

summer and fall seasons of 2019, though they 

provide an exciting sneak peek at what Bløm 

could offer in the coming bountiful seasons 

of 2020. In light of this pandemic, however, 

it’s challenging to watch the new spring 

season pass as you are unable to enjoy what 

Bløm might have created.

There are still ways to support your local 

restaurants and breweries — continuing to 

buy local food and drinks, providing generous 

tips to restaurant and delivery staff or when 

possible buying miscellaneous merchandise 

of your favorite local businesses. While it 

is possible to support Bløm Meadworks 

by purchasing their canned drinks and 

merchandise, 
supporting 
the 
artisanal, 

seasonal drinks that they create in small 

batches may be difficult if you are unable 

to go to Bløm’s curbside pick-up for a drink. 

Hopefully, you are able to support Bløm in 

their time of need. In the meantime, hope 

that you can enjoy Bløm’s curated tap by the 

full force of spring or summer.

Bløm Meadworks is located at 100 S 4th 

Avenue, Suite 110, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
