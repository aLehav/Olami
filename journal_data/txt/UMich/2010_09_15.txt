ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL
Student vies for A CCoUncil seat
with unconventional approach

Judge's decision has
blocked federal
funding for new
stem cell projects
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily Staff Reporter
Sean Morrison, director of the
University's Center for Stem Cell
Biology at the Life Sciences Insti-
tute, will testify on Thursday in
front of a United States Senate
subcommittee in Washington D.C.
to push for the continuation of fed-
eral funding for human embryonic
stem cell research.
The hearing, called "The Prom-
ise of Human Embryonic Stem
Cell Research," will be held before
the Senate Appropriations Sub-
committee on Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies.
The testimony comes about a
month after U.S. District Court
Judge Royce Lamberth ruled
against federal funding for human
embryonic stem cell research,
Morrison said in an interview last
night. In his ruling, Lamberth said
that an executive order issued by
President Barack Obama in March
2009 to expand funding for stem

cell research is illegal because it
could lead to the destruction of
embryos.
Scientists currently working
with embryonic stem cells funded
with federal dollars are allowed
to continue their work until a final
decision is made on the ruling, The
Associated Press reported. But
despite this caveat, Lamberth's
decision to halt funding for the
research has "thrown the field into
akind of crisis," Morrison said.
Since $6.8 million in federal
stimulus funds were awarded to
University researchers from the
National Institutes of Health last
year for stem cell-related proj-
ects, Morrison said the funding
halt would be detrimental to the
13 stem cell research projects cur-
rently underway at the University.
These studies are examining new
ways to treat diseases, he said.
At least five of the grants award-
ed to the University would be sus-
pended if the judge's ruling isn't
overturned, Morrison told The
Michigan Daily in an interview
lastweek.
Morrison said he plans to reiter-
ate the importance of legislation
that supports all forms of stem cell
research - including on adult and
embryonic stem cells - when he
speaks before the subcommittee.

Vehicles now
required to stop
fully at crosswalks
with no signal
By MELISSA MARCUS
Daily StaffReporter
A recently-implemented safety
ordinance aims to give Ann Arbor
pedestrians more rights on the
road.
The ordinance requires vehi-
cles to stop fully at crosswalks
with no traffic control signals,
instead of only yielding as they
were required to do in the past.

Currently, about 15 percent of
Ann Arbor residents walk to
work or school, and pedestrians
often encounter problems when
it comes to the safety of cross-
ing streets, according to a press
release from Ann Arbor city offi-
cials last week.
Vehicles must now stop for
those not only currently on the
crosswalk, but those approach-
ing it as well. This aims to provide
pedestrians with a greater sense
of security when approaching a
busy intersection or crosswalk.
But the ordinance dictates that
pedestrians can't enter a vehicle's
path when the driver is unable
to respond in the proper fashion.
Also, if a pedestrian does not cross

at a crosswalk, then they must
take it upon themselves to yield to
vehicles.
Eli Cooper, transportation pro-
gram manager for the City of Ann
Arbor, beganthe planning process
for the ordinance last fall, when
there was a Pedestrian Forum led
by the Washtenaw Walking and
Biking Coalition. Cooper served
as a panelist for the session, as
did individuals from the city and
community at large.
Cooper said the forum aimed
to figure out ways to enhance
pedestrian safety. City Council
members spoke about the types
of outreach elements that could
be conducted to improve the rela-

Takeshi Uchiyamada, executive
vice president of the Toyota Motor
Corporation, began his speech at
the Iacocca Auditorium on North
Campus yesterday by putting on a

University baseball cap, raising his
fist in the air and exclaiming, "Go
Blue!" The rest of his speech, how-
ever, was all about "going green"
when it comes to using alternative
types of cars and fuels.
"We must think seriously about
new alternative fuels," Uchiyama-
da said at the filled-to-capacity
event titled "Shaping the Future of
the Automobile."
Toyota began selling the Prius
- the hybrid car Uchiyamada is
credited with conceptualizing -
in the United States in 2000. In the
past 10 years, voltage, speed and

sales of the vehicle have increased,
Uchiyamada said.
In 2012, Toyota plans to intro-
duce new models of hybrids that
will have larger battery capacities
and the ability to recharge from an
external source. Uchiyamada said
these "plug-in hybrids" are also
projected to be more affordable
than current hybrid vehicles.
"It is important to find ways
to reduce oil consumption by
improving fuel economy," he said.

being the "Father of the Prius",

While most of his classmates were
working toward their college degrees,
Political Science Prof. Allan Stam decid-
ed to pause his studies and enlist in the
army halfway through his undergradu-
ate years at Cornell University.
It was this military background that
shaped his interest in politics, said Stam,
who's also a University alum.
"It was the experiences I had in the
army that led to my interest in specifi-
cally nuclear deterrence issues and then
subsequently international relations," he
said.
After spending three years in Army
Special Forces, Stam returned to Cornell
to finish his undergraduate degree, grad-
uating in 1988 with a bachelor of arts in
government.
While Stam grew up on the East
Coast, splitting his time between Wash-
ington D.C. and Boston, he decided to
attend graduate school at the University
of Michigan, where multiple members of
his family had studied, as well.

rom Army to academia

"My adviser at Cornell, Peter Katzen-
stein, urged me to go to Michigan," he
said. "I also have a younger brother and
sister and a grandfather that went to
Michigan."
After receiving his master's degree in
political science in 1991 and his Ph.D. in
political science in 1993, Stam went on to
teach at American University, Yale Uni-
versity and Dartmouth College.
In 2007, Stam returned to Ann Arbor
after the University offered him a posi-
tion at the Institute for Social Research.
In accordance with his army experi-
ence, Stam's main academic focus is on
armed conflict. Prior to teaching at the
University, Stam was involved in several
research projects on the topic.
"The first work I did was on who wins
and who loses wars and how long they
last," he said.
Stam's work has allowed him to travel
abroad and study various internation-
al conflicts. From 2003 to 2006, Stam
worked on a series of projects to better

understand the Rwandan Genocide.
In collaboration with Notre Dame
Professor Christian Davenport, Stam
studied the effects of political violence on
communities around the world including
in Gujarat, India.
"We did an area study where we inter-
viewed 150,000 people in Gujarat to doc-
ument specifically what are the bases of
intra-caste discrimination," he said.
Stam is currently working on two
related projects dealing with leadership
and military service.
While he has spent time teaching at
Yale and Dartmouth, Stam holds the
University in high esteem, citing it as
a specific point of pride for the state of
Michigan.
"One of things that I think is great
about the University of Michigan as
the flagship public university in a state,
there's a really wonderful reciprocal rela-
tionship between the people in Michigan
and their university," Stam said.

A plan that would cut the over-

The police agency doesn't plan
any trooper layoffs or post closings
as result of the budget for the fis-

Mex. immigration
officer resigns in
light of massacre
Mexico's top immigration offi-

of a massacre of 72 migrants that
exposed how brutally drug cartels

Cecilia Romero stepped down
as head *of the National Institute of
Migration, a post she had held since
the beginning of President Felipe

the Interior Department said in a
statement.
The statement gave no reason
for her resignation, only praising
Romero's efforts to modernize the
institute, improve migrant shelters,
and push through several accords
with other countries to help make
deportations more orderly.
A government official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to

the government was looking for

Former president
hopes prisoner
return will open
discourse
ATLANTA (AP) - Former Pres-
ident Jimmy Carter said Tues-
day that he hoped North Korea's
release of an American prisoner to
him would jump-start six-nation
denuclearization talks that could
lead to a permanent peace deal on
the peninsula.
Carter said he worked five weeks
to get permission from the White
House and the State Department
before making the private trip in
August to free Aijalon Gomes, 31,
who hadbeen held since he crossed
into the country from China on
Jan. 25 for unknown reasons. He
had been sentenced to eight years
hard labor.
North Korea officials told him
they would only release him if
Carter came to get the captive
himself, the former president said
in his first public remarks since
his journey to the country.
"We didn't have any communi-
cation with North Korea, so they
called and asked me to come over
there to get Mr. Gomes," the Geor-
gia Democrat said during a discus-
sion at the Carter Center. "They
said they would not let him go
to anyone except me. obviously,
they wanted me to come back over
there."

Carter would not say if he met
with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Ii. But he said he met with
leaders who told him "they were
eager to have peace talks that will
lead to the denuclearization of the
peninsula and a permanent peace
treaty with the U.S. and South
Korea."
Carter is well-regarded in North
Korea despite the longtime ani-
mosity between the two countries.
He met with the late President Kim
Il Sung on his last trip to Pyong-
yang in 1994 in a cordial meeting
that led to a landmark nuclear dis-
armament deal. The North Korean
leader died weeks later.
"They really revere me in a way
for being the last person who met
with Kim II Sung before he passed
away," the ex-president said.
"We meet with some unsa-
vory people, some outcasts from
international diplomatic circles,"
he said. "But they're the ones
who can solve problems involv-
ing unwarranted war or abuse of
human rights."
Carter, who traveled to China a
week after his visit, said he hoped
Gomes' release would start peace
talks. China has hosted the talks
since 2002but North Korea walked
awaylastyear inprotestofinterna-
tional condemnation following its
test of a long-range missile.
"I think they would like to be
accepted in the world political
environment," he said. "They do
some strange things because we
just don't understand them."

Vast majority votes
to pass bill, attracts
religious criticism
PARIS (AP) - The French Sen-
ate on Tuesday overwhelmingly
passed a bill banning the burqa-
style Islamicveil on public streets
and other places, a measure that
affects less than 2,000 women
but that has been widely seen as
a symbolic defense of French val-
ues.
The Senate voted 246 to 1
in favor of the bill in a final
step toward making the ban a
law - though it now must pass
muster with France's constitu-
tional watchdog. The bill was
overwhelmingly passed in July
in the lower house, the National
Assembly.
Many Muslims believe the
legislation is one more blow to
France's No. 2 religion, and risks
raising the level of Islamophobia
in a country where mosques, like
synagogues, are sporadic targets
of hate. However, the law's many
proponents say it will preserve
the nation's values, including its
secular foundations and a notion
of fraternity that is contrary to
those who hide their faces.
In an attempt to head off any
legal challenges over arguments
it tramples on religious and other
freedoms, the leaders of both par-
liamentary houses said they had
asked a special body to ensure it
passes constitutional muster. The
Constitutional Council has one

month to rule.
The bill is worded to trip safely
through legal minefields. For
instance, the words "women,"
"Muslim" and "veil" are not even
mentioned in any of its seven
articles.
"This law was the object of
long and complex debates," the
Senate president, Gerard Larch-
er, and National Assembly head
Bernard Accoyer said in a joint
statement announcing their
move. They said they want to be
certain there is "no uncertainty"
about its conforming to the con-
stitution.
France would be the first Euro-
pean country to pass such a law,
though others, notably neighbor-
ing Belgium, are considering laws
against face-covering veils, seen
as conflicting with the local cul-
ture.
"Our duty concerning such
fundamental principles of our
society is to speak with one
voice," said Justice Minister
Michele Alliot-Marie, opening
a less than 5-hour-long debate
ahead of the vote.
The measure, carried by Presi-
dent Nicolas Sarkozy's conser-
vative party, was passed by the
lower house of parliament, the
National Assembly, on July 13.
It would outlaw face-covering
veils, including those worn by
tourists from the Middle East,
on public streets and elsewhere.
The bill set fines of euro150
($185) or citizenship classes for
any woman caught covering her
face, or both. It also carries stiff
penalties for anyone, such as hus-

bands or brothers, convicted of
forcing the veil on a woman. The
euro30,000 ($38,400) fine and
year in prison are doubled if the
victim is a minor.
The bill is aimed at ensuring
gender equality, women's dignity
and security, as well as upholding
France's secular values - and its
way of life.
Some women, like Kenza Drid-
er, have vowed to wear a full-face
veil despite a law. Drider says she
prefers to flirt with arrest rather
than bow to what she says is an
injustice.
"It is a law that is unlawful,"
said Drider, a mother of four from
Avignon, in southern France. "It
is ... against individual liberty,
freedom of religion, liberty of
conscience," she said.
"I willicontinue to live my life
as I always have with my full
veil," she told Associated Press
Television News.
Drider was the only woman
who wears a full-faced veil to
be interviewed by a parliamen-
tary panel that spent six months
deciding whether to move ahead
with legislation.
Muslim leaders concur that
Islam does not require a woman
to hide her face. However, they
have voiced concerns that a law
forbidding them to do so would
stigmatize the French Muslim
population, which at an esti-
mated 5 million is the largest in
western Europe. Numerous Mus-
lim women who wear the face-
covering veil have said they are
being increasingly harassed in
the streets.

for FEMA buyouts
years after flooding

Trappendtiners to
be guaranteed jobs

More than two
years after floods,
federal gov't has yet
to fulfill promise
SEELYVILLE, Ind. (AP) -
Karen Niece loves her idyllic bun-
galow in the Indiana countryside,
but when storms dumped nearly a
foot of rain on her 19-acre proper-
ty in 2008, flash floods left mold in
the foundation - and gave Niece
a lung infection she will have the
rest of her life.
After the water receded, Niece
and thousands of other flood vic-
tims around the Midwest stayed
in their damaged homes, despite
health risks, because they had
pinned their hopes on a federal
program that helps buy flood-
damaged properties. Two and
even three years later, many are
still waiting for relief.
"I really don't want to leave,
but I don't want to get sicker," the
66-year-old homemaker said, sit-
ting at her kitchen counter about
60 miles southwest of Indianapo-
lis. "But I haven't heard anything.
I don't know what they'll do or if
they'll do anything."
The Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency helps local gov-
ernments purchase flood-prone
properties to save on future
cleanup costs. But the buyouts are
not automatic, nor are they quick,
which is raising questions about
whether the program is worth the

limbo it creates for homeowners.
"The last thing you need when
recovering from a disaster is won-
dering whether FEMA is going to
have the money to pay what they
owe," said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, a
Democrat from North Dakota,
another state where the buy-
out process bogged down after
FEMA's disaster aid ran dry.
More than $13 million was on
hold in North Dakota alone, delay-
ing the buyouts of more than 100
homes affected by floods last year.
Communities that partici-
pate in the program must agree
to take the properties off the tax
rolls and maintain them as green
space. Homeowners must decide
whether to accept the govern-
ment's offer. The process can take
months in the best cases.
In western Indiana's Vigo
County, time has virtually stood
still since June 2008, when
storms dumped up to 10 inches
of rain on parts of the state. The
floodwaters killed three people
and caused hundreds of millions
of dollars in damage. President
Bush declared 39 Indiana coun-
ties disaster areas.
FEMA still has not approved
any of Vigo County's seven buyout
plans.
"There are days when it's just
really hard to think about," said
Honnalora Hubbard, Niece's for-
mer neighbor. "Two years later,
you're still not able to put a trau-
matic experience behind you."
The delays in Indiana have cre-
ated "a big, long line of black holes

of people waiting," said Dean
Bruce, a member of the town
board in the southern Indiana
community of Spencer, where 23
flooded properties still don't have
FEMA approval.
Congress passed a war fund-
ing bill July 27 that included $5.1
billion to replenish FEMA's disas-
ter-relief fund, but there's been
little improvement. Spokeswoman
Rachel Racusen said the agency
has a backlog of "thousands of
projects" from floods and other
disasters.
"Though FEMA provides fund-
ing for this program, the decision
to participate in the program and
a large part of the application pro-
cess takes place at the state and
local level," Racusen said Tuesday.
Homeowners in Wisconsin,
where floods in 2007 and 2008
caused extensive damage, are
experiencing similar delays.
In Gays Mills, a village about
80 miles northwest of Madison,
FEMA purchased 25 homes after
the floods.
But Michelle Engh, a housing
specialist with a Wisconsin non-
profit group called CouleeCap,
said none of her clients are in
new homes yet..And many hom-
eowners who did receive buyouts
did not get paid enough to buy
new homes, with lots of their
properties appraised for around
$40,000.
"There's this gap that exists
between what people received
and the cost of the new home,"
Engh said.

After 40 days,
miners could still
face months
underground
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -
Chile's 33 trapped miners have
something good to think about:
their next jobs. Bulldozer driver,
mechanic, electrician. And here's a
couple they might find particularly
useful: "risk reduction specialist"
and "escape-tunnel driller."
Two dozen companies with
operations in Chile have made
more than 1,000 job offers to the
trapped miners and their 317 side-
lined co-workers at a job fair this
week. Even if they choose to go
back to mining, the work won't
necessarily be underground and
it will almost certainly be with
a company with a better safety
record than their struggling cur-
rent employer.
The 33 miners have been
trapped for 40 days in harrowing,
sweltering conditions since an
Aug. 5 collapse. No miners in his-
tory have been trapped so long,
and it still could be months before
a hole large enough to get them
out is completed. They are get-
ting food, medicine, communica-
tion and other essentials through
narrower holes dug by rescuers,
but their anxiety has become evi-
dent, with more questions asked
each time they hear the drilling
stop.
Their relatives wait anxiously
for the miners, many in tents at
the mine itself, but in many ways
life goes on without them. One
of them, Ariel Ticona, became a
father for the first time Tuesday.
The San Esteban mining com-

pany, which owns the mine, has
pursued bankruptcy protection
since the collapse and has claimed
it can't afford to pay the trapped
miners, even though they'll have
to work their way out by clearing
rubble around the clock below the
escape tunnels.
The San Jose miners have been
offered 1,188 jobs as of Tuesday,
many of them posted on a gov-
ernment labor ministry web site.
Mining industry companies have
interviewed some 200 of the min-
ers who are not trapped at a hotel
in the regional capital of Copiapo,
and say they have no trouble wait-
ing for the trapped miners to be
rescued before they interview
them as well.
"The 33 won't be without a
job," vowed Sara Morales, a dep-
uty human resources director for
Terra Services, a Chilean drilling
company. She told The Associ-
ated Press on Tuesday that she had
received resumes from 80 miners
and will offer 20 of them jobs.
There will be no deadline for the
trapped miners to take advantage
of this "relocation program," said
Jose Tomas Letelier, a vice-presi-
dent at Canadian gold miningcom-
pany Kinross.
None of the trapped miners
should have to venture back into
marginal mines like San Jose that
struggle to meet Chile's modern
safety standards. Many of these
job offers come from some of the
world's most advanced mining
companies - major international
players making huge investments
in Chile.
The companies are prepared
to have the miners work as truck
or bulldozer drivers, heavy equip-
ment operators, electricians,
mechanics, and supervisors in var-
ious jobs up on the surface.

Bank on recycling

CHRISTINA SUH

E-MAIL CHRISTINA AT CHSUH@UMICH.EDU

Students should capitalize on incentives to go green

ING!
First they came for the president

I *

Everyone knows that recycling is good for the earth - but
did you know it could also be good for your wallets? That's
the incentive used by the program that will be Ann Arbor's
partner in recycling for the next 10 years. The program, called
RecycleBank, focuses on promoting environmental friendliness
by offering incentive points that are redeemable at participating
businesses. Since the program is newly established, there are some
issues that the city and RecycleBank need to figure out - like dis-
tributing points to shared residences. But nevertheless, students
and residents should take advantage of the points-based program
to benefit the environment.

In July, Ann Arbor shifted to a sin-
gle-stream recycling system. The shift
attracted RecycleBank, a New-York based
initiative that operates internationally, to
increase recycling. RecycleBank aims to
make participation in its recycling pro-
gram simple. Households that choose to
participate will receive a 64-gallon Recy-
cleBank cart. As reported by the Daily
last week, Recyclebank carts will contain
a sensor. When households participate,
they will be credited with points on online
accounts. These points are redeemable at
restaurants like Zingerman's Deli and Ann
Arbor Brewing Company, grocers and both
local and national retailers. The program
was enacted on Sept. 1.
The RecycleBank program was made
possible by Ann Arbor's switch to a sin-
gle-stream recycling system. This system
allowed residents to recycle everything in
one easy trip to the curb without having to
sort plastics from paper.
Many college students live on a tight bud-
get. This new program will help students
save the world and put a few bucks in their
pockets in the process. If students haven't
already been recycling, there's absolutely
no reason now not to throw their card-
board pizza boxes in the recycle bin rather

than the trash. According to a spokeswom-
an for RecycleBank, program participants
can earn between $130 to $200 in points
per year. Points are redeemable at some of
the many popular businesses frequented
by students like The village Apothecary,
Cottage Inn and Stucchi's, according to the
Ann Arbor city government's website.
However, there is a minor glitch in this
seemingly beneficial program: the problem
of dealing with group housing, which is
common in Ann Arbor. It's not very prac-
tical for everyone in a residence to have
their own 64-gallon RecycleBank cart -
that would take up quite a bit of space. One
possible way to manage the problem is for
RecycleBank to distribute the points equal-
ly among the number of residents. Or the
program could award points in a lump sum
to each house and let the residents work it
out. Students should voice their opinion and
offer suggestions to fix the only problem in
an otherwise great plan. Students enrolled
in the program can comment on service at
www.recyclebank.com.
RecycleBank has made it more personal-
ly profitable than ever to recycle. There is
no reason to not take advantage of this new
program to continue to clean up and pre-
serve our planet - and get another pizza.

Sometimes it's difficult for me
to accept that things like rac-
ism and homophobia still exist
in the world today.
But living in Ann
Arbor has shown
me that instances =
of bias and preju-
dice can happen
anywhere, even in
the most liberal of
places. If you don't
believe me, sim-
ply Google "Chris NOEL
Armstrong Watch"
and you'll find doz-
ens of examples of
hate speech that
personally attack our newest Michi-
gan Student Assembly president,
Chris Armstrong. Unfortunately for
the "concerned Michigan alumnus"
operating this blog, I also know how
to spot a bigot when I see one.
According to the Attorney Gen-
eral's office, 2002 University gradu-
ate Andrew Shirvell is an Michigan
assistant attorney general, as reported
by the Daily yesterday. He has a long
history of launching personal attacks
against members of LGBTQ commu-
nity, abortion rights supporters and
congressional Democrats.
And even though you'd think
Shirvell would have learned his lesson
by now given his various run-ins with
people who have decried his outra-
geous behavior in the past, he's back to
his old tricks again with "Chris Arm-
strong Watch." The site, he claims in
his opening post, is "for concerned
University of Michigan alumni, stu-
dents, and others who oppose the
recent election of Chris Armstrong -
a radical homosexual activist, racist,
elitist, and liar - as the new head of
student government." But, per usual,
Shirvell has willfully mischaracter-

ized his victim in a feeble attempt to
gain legitimacy and credibility.
In the same Apr. 29 entry, Shirvell
insists that our new MSA president
plans to "promote (a) radical homo-
sexual agenda, including gay 'mar-
riage' and adoption 'rights."' But
that doesn't seem right. When asked
about this issue in an interview with
the Daily, Armstrong unequivocally
said that he planned to advocate for
all students regardless of their sexual
orientation.
Just a few paragraphs later, Shirvell
suggests that Armstrong's support of
gender-neutral housing will "endan-
ger female students, as it will also
force heterosexuals of different gen-
ders to share the same room and
will undoubtedly lead to a massive
increase in rapes." But that argument
doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
because a gender-neutral housing
option - which hasn't even become
official University policy yet - will
undoubtedly beone that is opt-in only.
And while it's certainly possible that
there might be an increase of rapes at
the University with the implementa-
tion of such a policy, it isn't "undoubt-
edly" going to happen. As far as I
know, there is no causal link between
simply living with a member of the
opposite sex and getting raped.
I suppose the one thing that I can't
criticize Shirvell for is his condemna-
tion of Armstrong's decision to join
the Order of Angell. But disagreeing
with the president's decision to join
Angell doesn't justify vilifying him,
his family or his friends. Shirvell
doesn't want to "ensure that (Chris
Armstrong) does not discriminate
against pro-life, pro-family, Chris-
tian, and minority student organiza-
tions at U of M" as he suggests in his
May 11blog post. He wants to promote
his own radical, hate-filled agenda by

whatever means necessary.
I am a firm believer in the First
Amendment. But this isn't a First
Amendment issue. This is unsub-
stantiated character assassination.
You can't publicly speculate about
a person's sexual history, stalk his
Facebook page for material you think
supports your absurd position or
harass students who make clearly sar-
castic remarks at your expense. These
are the actions of a coward - nothing
more, nothing less. People who make
baseless accusations from behind a
computer screen don't deserve a plat-
form. That, to me, seems to suggest
that Shrivell has something to hide,
whether that is alack of evidence or a
lack of character.
Students should
unite against
alum's hate speech.
It is our job as a community of
proud Wolverines to ensure that
Shirvell does not make a mockery
of what it means to have once worn
the maize and blue. We must stand
up against his attempts to victimize
Armstrong. Failing to do so would
allow Shirvell to continue moving
from victim to victim without pause.
We must stand up and fight against
all forms of intolerance lest we forget
the somber fate of those who regret-
fully conceded that, "First they came
for the Communists, but I did not
speak up because I was not a Com-
munist."

Stand up for tolerance

Your choice of spiritual utensil

Last Saturday was the ninth anniversary of
the terrorist attacks on Sept, 11, 2001. That day
unified us as Americans. But at the very same
time, it divided us across religious lines and
amplified negative Muslim stereotypes.
Over the past few months, this anti-Muslim
sentiment has reared its ugly head across the
nation. In May, a man brought a pipe bomb into
a Florida mosque during daily prayers and set
it off. In late August, a cab driver in New York
City was stabbed by his passenger after the
driver told the passenger he was Muslim.
Most prominent in the news is the contro-
versial Islamic community center in New York
City not far from ground zero. Created for the
purpose of social and cultural activities, it has
been inaccurately portrayed by some news
media and many renowned pundits as a radical
Islamic headquarters in one of America's most
iconic cities.
Though the acts on Sept. 11 were commit-
ted in the name of Islam, Islam is a large and
diverse religion. It is a gross misrepresentation
to associate a small number of fanatics with all
of Islam. The writers of this viewpoint think it's
vital that Americans understand that the ter-
rorist acts of Sept. 11, 2001 were carried out by
radical extremists motivated by fear and hate
- a description that doesn't include most of the
wide array of Muslims across the world. We
have been appalled by all of these events as well
as the support that these anti-Muslim extrem-
ists have received from the American public.
Signs of anti-Muslim sentiments are taking
root on university campuses in this area. At
Michigan State University, a Quran was burned
and left on the steps of a local mosque. Pages
from the book were spread throughout the
campus. Even here in Ann Arbor, some Mus-
lim students have been the victims of hateful
actions. Our campus community should act
now before the hate gets worse.
As members of JStreetU, we are dedicated to
finding a peaceful and just solution to the Israe-
li-Palestinian conflict. To achieve this, there
must be mutual respect on both sides. Because
many locations in the Middle East are consid-
ered holy by all three Abrahamic religions,

peace in this region can't come without mutual
religious respect. Pervasive anti-Muslim senti-
ments are a major issue prohibiting a peaceful
agreementbetween Israelis and Palestinians. If
America - which is leading the peace talks at
the moment - can't bring its citizens to appre-
ciate Muslim citizens, then our nation has no
place at the bargaining table. As Americans, we
want to be present in creating a solution. This
requires an end to negative Muslim stereotypes
and violence against Muslims at home to make
peace abroad.
Starting right now, the University's chapter
of JStreetU is joining over 50 campuses across
the country in a massive campaign to fight anti-
Muslim hate acts and speech across America.
We have started a petition that aims at raising
awareness on campus and becoming a presence
in this important national conversation. This
fight is important to us as students, to the cam-
pus community and to our nation. Most impor-
tantly, the fight against anti-Islam sentiments is
important to the peace process.
JStreetU calls upon the University campus
to join this effort for unity in this time of divi-
sion. Campus leaders - Muslim and non-Mus-
lim, religious and non-religious - should join
together as a unified force to fight unfair ste-
reotypes and actions. Everyone deserves to feel
safe in their community. Joining our campaign
will bring us one step closer to developing a safe
and supportive community for all students.
The University community prides itself on
its inclusiveness. JStreetU aims to make that
ideal a reality. People will notice a unified
movement to stop hateful stereotypes. Ameri-
cans will take a moment and reconsider their
abusive stance towards Muslims and recognize
the need for respect for all. '
Sign our petition and join us. Please contact
either of us at yonahl@umich.edu or aglevy@
umich.edu if you are interested in joining the
coalition or find us at our booth in Mason Hall,
starting one week from today.

of the University's chapter of JStreetU and

There is no spoon.
Okay, there is a spoon, but
it's in the drawer. I think it
would be weird if
a person only had
spoons, but some
people just think
that they are the
best of the uten-
sils. So whether ,
they keep forks
and knives or not is
their prerogative.
People should be ERIC
able to use which-S
ever of the three SZKARLAT
utensils that they
like. And what is it
to me where you keep your spoons, or
when you buy them?
Now replace the word "spoon" with
the word "mosque". Replace "drawer"
with "community center." Replace
"forks" and "knives" with "churches"
and "synagogues." Adjust the scenar-
ios accordingly, and you have a situa-
tion similar to the one regarding the
so-called "ground zero mosque."
Eating utensils aren't as odd a choice
of a metaphor as you may think. Frank-
ly, whichever of the Abrahamic reli-
gions youpracticeyou share aspiritual
history with the other two, particular-
ly the prophets. The figure Abraham
is the root of all three. The Quran, the
Old Testament and the Bible all share
common laws and stories, includ-
ing what are often known as the "Ten
Commandments." All three consider
Jerusalem a holy city.
Yes, there are numerous differences,
just like between eating utensils. Usu-
ally, if you buy a particular set of silver-
ware, they will share similar handle
designs, be made of the same material,
have the same shine, and be roughly
similar sizes to one another. Their
functions can even overlay. Certainly
you could either use a fork or a spoon to

eat your macaroni and cheese.
In the Western World food is...
heavenly, for lack of a better word.
So if we consider an arbitrary divine
creator and its related paradise to be
food and the utensil used to be which-
ever Abrahamic religion you practice
- if any - then what does it matter
whether you worship in a mosque,
synagogue or church? Abrahamic
religions are more similar to each
other than you might gather at first
glance. Granted, you will get some-
thing different from each particular
religion, and they are absolutely not
the same. But the similarities - if you
study these religions extensively -
are striking.
So why is a mosque so contro-
versial? Certainly a form of violent
radicalism arose from Islam. But
al-Qaeda is not demanding to build
a monument on ground zero. If the
planned structure was a church or a
synagogue and someone protested,
millions of people would likely stand
defiant in support of American values
and condemn the protesters. And the
First Amendment states explicitly
they have the right to protest.
But the First Amendment clearly
establishes something else: We are
a country of free religion. If you
practice reasonably, you may prac-
tice Christianity, Judaism, Islam or
anything else - or you may practice
nothing at all. Some might argue
that practicing insensitively, as some
believe is the case with the proposed
community center, is practicing
unreasonably. Others might argue
that freedom of location isn't part
of freedom of religion. But reason-
able practice requires more than the
threat of insensitivity.
And while freedom isn't always
absolute, it's actually beneficial to our
cause to permit peaceful Muslims to
practice in such a location. It shows

that we were not destroyed on that
day. The terrorists who hate West-
ern ways of life didn't win on Sept. 11,
2001, and we must show them that by
not compromising those ways even
when it's insensitive or inconvenient.
First Amendment
protects ground
zero mosque. 0
The Muslims of this project have
every right to exercise their religion
wherever they want. If we deny them
this right - whether as a society or
as a republic - we're closing one gap
between American values and radi-
cal values. We are admitting that we
think it is wrong to practice one reli-
gion freely, but not others. We move
one step closer to a theocracy and one
step away from freedom.
The reason the United States is a
great nation is because it allows citi-
zens to use whichever spiritual tool
they like to reach whatever god you
like. It's a utensil store. Like every-
thing else in our society, it is plu-
ralistic and offers multiple choices.
Just because you prefer the fork does
not mean the spoon cannot function
just as well in the same place. We all
live in the United States and we all
draw from the same drawer of spiri-
tual utensils based upon what we're
exposed to.
If you're like me, you still haven't
decided where you stand on issues of
religion. I don't know about you, but
if there were no spoon I would feel as
if the world were just a little emptier.

Toyota official says that he hopes
to continue to collaborate with 'U'

From Page 1A
outlined Toyota's plans to create
an automobile that uses alternative
energy sources and is more fuel
efficient. He said the company will
aim to increase the use of "smart
grid" - when an automobile plugs
into a grid to re-charge - and
hybrid technologies.
Uchiyamada said Toyota hopes
to continue to collaborate with
both the University and Ann
Arbor. Today, over 1,000 engineers
work for Toyota in Ann Arbor.
"I hope some of you will also
join our team," Uchiyamada told
the audience.

Uchiyamada addedthatthelocal
Toyota technical center would be
actively hiring University students
in the future. He said the Univer-
sity has been a great help with
research for Toyota in the past and
he hopes this will continue into the
future.
"I believe that it's important that
we have a lot of good students come
from the University of Michigan to
work at Toyota," Uchiyamada said.
In addition to fuel efficiency,
Uchiyamada said Toyota values
safety. The corporation meets all
safety guidelines for the countries
selling Toyota automobiles, he
said.

Toyota has been under fire in
the past year after it recalled a
number of vehicles for a variety
of problems including unintended
acceleration.
"But beyond that, we have our
own standards that go beyond
those regulations to make the vehi-
cle safe," Uchiyamada said.
Rackham graduate student Ye-
sheng Kuo said he enjoyed Uchi-
yamada's presentation, adding
that it gave him a sense of Toyota's
plans for developing green tech-
nology.
"I think Toyota is a leadingcom-
pany in the future of vehicles for
alternative energy," Kuo said.

While some University profes-
sors see the meetings as a cata-
lyst for lasting change, others are
more skeptical of the potential
outcomes.
Mark Tessler, the Universi-
ty's vice provost of international
affairs, said the two entities are
working on long-term issues this
time around rather than short-
term problems as they've done in
past talks.
The issues include the status of
Jerusalem, Israeli settlements in
the West Bank, the region's bor-
ders and the status of Palestin-
ian refugees, Tessler said. Those
issues must be resolved before
a "permanent resolution" to the
conflict can be reached, he added.
Unlike in past peace talks when
the United States suggested cer-
tain policies, the United States is
taking a backseat role during this
year's meetings, according to Tes-
sler.
"(The U.S.'s) contribution is on
the process, not on the substance,"
Tessler said.
But Victor Lieberman, Marvin
B. Becker Collegiate Professor of
History, said the U.S. is still play-
ing a crucial role in the talks.
"The United States is going to be
involved at all stages, in a closely
monitoring capacity," Lieberman
said.
Nothing is off limits during the
peace talks, Lieberman added.
In the past negotiations, the par-
ties have come to the table under
certain coniditions or with agree-
ments to only address certain

issues.
"They're supposed to be uncon-
ditional, with no prior commit-
ments," Lieberman said. "All
topics are up for discussion."
Part of what brought the parties
to the table is a shared concern
over addressing concerns about
Iran, Lieberman said.
"Israel, the U.S., the (Palestin-
ian Authority), and some leading
Arab states share a novel antipa-
thy to Iran, and this sense of a
common enemy may foster novel
threads of alliance and a novel
sense of urgency," Lieberman
wrote in an e-mail.
The peace talks' chances of suc-
cess arebetterthan theyhave been
in the past, according to Political
Science Professor Jim Morrow.
"The thing that I think looks
most optimistic in the current
situation is that the current Pales-
tinianPrime Ministerisveryinter-
ested in trying to build up civil
and political institutions within
the Palestinian Authority, which,
if it's successful, might belay a lot
of Israel's concerns," said Morrow,
who is also a research professor
for the Center for Political Stud-
ies at the University's Institute of
Social Research.
However, Tessler expressed a
different view on the prospect of
an agreement.
"The odds of reaching an agree-
ment on the final status issues are
not impossible, but the odds are
against it," he said.
LSA junior Richard Kallus,
chair of the American Movement
for Israel, pro-Israel group on
campus, said he hopes a resolution
can come from ihe talks.'
"A peaceful resolution would

help establish a two-state solu-
tion and allow both sides to feel
safe and secure within their own
states," Kallus wrote in an e-mail
interview.
LSA junior Ahmad Hasan,
co-chair of Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality - a pro-
Palestinian group on campus
- said he views the situation dif-
ferently.
"The whole peace process,
the whole concept, is meaning-
less, unnecessary, but also kind
of skews the view towards how
people perceive the Palestine and
Israeli conflict right now," he
said.
Hasan said he thinks that the
talks are taking place in a frame-
work that is unfair to the Palestin-
ians because the Israeli officials
have more power when it comes to
control of the region.
"It doesn't make sense to see
Israel and Palestine as equals on
the table," he said.
Kallus said students should
have a vested interest in the con-
flict and in the resolution that will
hopefully follow.
"Students should care because
not only are millions of lives in
the Middle East affected but, ulti-
mately, it will affect all of us," Kal-
lus wrote. "If this conflict can be
equitably resolved then that will
give hope for a peaceful solution
for all other conflicts."
Like Kallus, Hasan said stu-
dents should maintain an active
awareness of the situation.
"It's one of the largest world
issues currently happening that
involves social justice issues and
that's one of the core values of the
University of Michigan," he said.

ORDINANCE

tionship between pedestrians and
vehicles, specifically in city cross-
walks.
"My work is fully support-
ive of types of changes that have
occurred," Cooper said.
The individuals involved with
the ordinance began to outline an
education program to get the word
out to motorists and pedestrians
through brochures and media
releases. The members were also
hoping to have additional signage
in various areas of the community
that will provide notice to vehicles
that they must stop for pedestri-
ans in those areas, Cooper said.
Council member Carsten Hohn-
ke (D-Ward 5), who, has also been
a strong advocate for increased
pedestrian safety, said he's already
seen the success of the ordinance.
Hohnke added that he's been
working with attorneys offices and
the Ann Arbor Police Department
for over a year to make sure the
ordinance is enforceable.
"All ordinance changes take
some time to impact the commu-
nity," Hohnke said. "I have noticed
more and more cars stopping for
people at unsignaled crosswalks."
Over the summer, Cooper and
the Ann Arbor Police Department
conducted a targeted enforcement
campaign at two intersections
using changeable message signs
and messaging in the vicinity of
two crosswalks. The messages
announced that the local law was

to yield to pedestrians in cross-
walks.
Police then observed the motor-
ists' interactions with the pedes-
trians and determined that the
new ordinance was necessary for
the safety of pedestrians. Cooper
said the intent of this targeted
enforcement wasn't to purposeful-
ly cause a driver to receive a ticket,
but to raise public awareness of
the rules.
There was a press release that
made drivers aware of this target-
ed'enforcement as well as the visu-
al presence of police that resulted
in no citations, but more public
awareness.
"Everyone walks, so this ordi-
nance affects all. Every trip begins
or ends with a walking segment,"
Cooper said. "I am pleased to see
the community that I work in take
pedestrian rights seriously. Pro-
viding these protections will cre-
ate a safe environment for those
of us already walking in the com-
munity."
Hohnke added that he believes
the ordinance will provide a more
comfortable walking experience in
the campus and downtown areas.
"I hope this ordinance will
make students' walking experi-
ence around campus more pleas-
ant and safer," Hohnke said.
Nancy Shore, a University alum
and program director of the get-
Downtown Program inAnn Arbor,
which aims to reduce the number
of drivers in Ann Arbor, said she
hopes the ordinance will encour-
age people to use public transpor-
tation and not drive.

"I think the ordinance is a good
idea because Ann Arbor should be
finding ways to make itself more
pedestrian-friendly," Shore said.
"A pedestrian-friendly community
attracts young professionals who
are interested in living in a nice,
attractive community."
Cooper added that he has
already seen changes in drivers'
behavior. But he said it is still
important that students still cre-
ate person-to-person contact with
motorists, and are respectful and
aware of the changing laws.
"There is a different mind-
set that is beginning to exist in
our community and the intent is
acknowledging all pedestrians,"
Cooper said. "I hope (University
students) feel more welcomed as
pedestrians with these changes."
Cooper and Shore both
acknowledged that this ordinance
is not the only method of increas-
ing public awareness about pedes-
trian safety.
Cooper added that over time,
the Ann Arbor community will
continue to provide awareness
and future targeted enforcement
activities in order to really raise
pedestrians' comfort as they enter
crosswalks.
Shore said the ordiriance is the
first step in increasing awareness
of pedestrian issues.
"Even if we have the ordinance,
if it is not promoted in the com-
munity, it is hard for people to
know what is happening," she
said. "People can come around
to understanding, they just need
more information."

his bid to be elected to representi
Ward 2.
Clark's ad campaign features
a poster he describes as "a cross
between a dustbowl-era travel-
ing circus and a Russian theater ,
from the Victorian age." The
unconventional poster, accord-
ing to Clark, serves as a remindera
that he's not a typical candidate.
In fact, as Clark pointed out
throughout the interview, he hasY
no interest in a long-term politi-
cal future and, if elected, plans to
only serve on the city council for
a single 2-year term.
With this self-imposed con-
straint, Clark said he'll have
more freedom to take risks than
other council members who are
seeking reelection.

things that make us different
that make us who we are, that
make us unique."
After the White House
announced last year's speech,
some parents threatened to pull
their kids from class during
Obama's remarks. Conservatives
also accused him of trying to
inject politics into the classroom.
A similar outcry has been
missing this year.
Schools were not required to
show the speech, as was the case
last year. Some schools also gave
parents the option of havingtheir
kids participate in another activ-
ity during the broadcast. As with

last year's speech, the White
House released the text a day
early so people could read it and
judge for themselves.
Speaking from the auditorium
at the Julia R. Masterman Labo-
ratory and Demonstration School
for fifth- through 12th-graders,
Obama urged students to stay
in school, study hard and take
responsibility for their educa-
tion. He said the nation's ability
to compete globally in the 21st
century depends on an educated
work force.
He also said nothing is beyond
their reach as long as they dream
big, work hard and focus on
learning.

"We don't yet know where the
new therapies are going to come
from and we won't know until the
research is done," he said in the
interview last night. "We are far
too early in the development of the
field to start blocking or weighing
all of our bets on one type of stem
cell and reject others."
In March 2009, the University
opened the Consortium for Stem
Cell Therapies, a facility that is
researching the derivation of new
stem cell lines to study diseases.
If the federal ruling remains in
place, funding for the center and
projects using embryonic stem
cells would also be put in jeop-
ardy, Morrison told the Daily last
week.
In an interview with the Daily
last month, Max Wicha, director
of the University's Cancer Cen-
ter, said if the government blocks
federal funds for research, it will
have a "chilling effect" on stem
cell research conducted through-
out the country. He explained
that the U.S. would lose many
researchers who would travel to
other nations in order to continue
their work.
Morrison also said last night
that he is concerned that the issue
could be "caught up in election

year politics," as subcommit-
tee members may be reluctant to
support an issue as contentious
as stem cell research right before
a highly partisan election. This
might slow the passage of legisla-
tion relating to the field, he said.
The problem for researchers
like Morrison is that legislation
supporting stem cell research was
passed by Congress twice before,
he said, but was eventually vetoed
by then-President George W.
Bush.
Despite these past mishaps,
Morrison said he is confident
that he has support within the
subcommittee, as it is composed
of senators who are "sympathet-
ic" to the cause. Morrison cited
U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa),
who is a past sponsor of funding
expansion for stem cell research.
In addition to Morrison,
Francis Collins, director of the
National Institutes of Health and
a former University professor, and
George Daley, director of Stem
Cell Transplantation at Children's
Hospital Boston, are scheduled to
speak at the hearing, according to
a University News Service state-
ment released on Tuesday.
- Daily News Editor Stephanie
Steinberg and The Associated
Press contributed to this report.

fire prevention comprehensively
enough to effectively prevent
house fires.
"Let's solve the problem of low
response times, or blocked exits
before we say the couches are the
problem," Clark said.
If elected, Clark said he plans
to deal with issues through his
"open source" website, where he
said constituents will be able to
post feedback and offer sugges-
tions on issues facing the city
council.
"Don't ma ke (voters) lobby you
through some nine-hour bitch-

fest," he said. "Make it easy for
them."
In the weeks leading up to the
November elections, Clark said
he plans to personally reach out
to the student-heavy sectors of
the fifth ward. Clark said coun-
cil members rely on students not
voting - something he hopes to
change with his campaign.
"I walk home through that
neighborhood everyday after
class and there's hundreds of
kids sitting on their porch," Clark
said. "I worry...they're complete-
ly discounted."

So You Think You Can Save The Last Bring It On? You Got Served!... Step Up! ... Road House-
No cheers for 'Helicats'

The CW's human
pyramid topples over
in campy new series
By BRIANNE JOHNSON
For the Daily
"Where there's football, could
cheerleading be far behind?" asks
brand new Hellcat Marti Perkins.
As fall sweeps
students into the
crowded bleach-
ers for football Heilcats
season, televi-
sion screens are Wednesdays
locked on - no, at 9 p.m.
not hours of The CW
gut-wrench-
ing football footage - but on the
cheerleaders. More specifically,
the Lancer University cheerlead-
ers, tumbling and fumbling around
on the CW's new series "Hellcats."
"Mean Girls" minus the wit and
"Bring it On" without the spirit,
"Hellcats" is a tedious hour of
everything but the "meow" its
name implies.
Marti "The Martyr" Perkins
(Alyson Michalka, "Phil of the
Future") is a pre-law blonde bomb-
shell forced to endure the Ijellpat
regime for the sake of securing a
scholarship. An ex-gymnast, Marti
is driven back to the mat by her
costly education and irresponsible

mother, a woman whose "soul-
sucking presence" and drunken
antics triggered Marti's decision
to depart from gymnastics in the
beginning. Gail O'Grady ("Ameri-
can Dreams") is the tight-lipped
and plastic-surgery prone Wanda
Perkins, bumbling around with her
daughter's best interests in mind,
wanted or not. But her mother's
behavior should be the last thing on
Marti's mind.
Along with a jealous teammate
itching for revenge and a poten-
tial love triangle secretly forming,
the school is threatening to cut the
Hellcats due to budget problems.
According to cheerleading Coach
Vanessa Lodge (Sharon Leal, "Why
did I get Married Too?"), the Hell-
cats are in need of a fresh perspec-
tive. Unfortunately, "Hellcats" does
not deliver.
Michalka is unrealistic as the
alternative "wrong-side-of-the-
tracks" character, complete with
leather jacket and anti-establish-
ment snarks. As oiled males and
scantily clad extras decorate the
scenes, Michalka's attempts at
spontaneous dance outbreaks are
awkward and leave more than just
her fellow cheerleaders wondering
what just happened. The result is
a curly-mopped, Taylor Swift clone
doing Michael Jackson in sparkly
Converse, strange pelvic thrusting
included. Michalka is shadowed by
the talent of more physically expe-

rienced extras and even more so by
the supportingcast.
Salvageable at least are the per-
formances of Matt Barr ("Harper's
island") and Ashley Tisdale ("High
School Musical"). Barr plays ador-
ably cocky, yet genuine Dan Patch.
With fussy, spiked blond hair and
the gaze of an Upper East Side stun-
ner, Dan is one of Marti's multiple
suitors. Pulling double duty as Mar-
ti's best friend, Dan pleads her to
stay grounded amid the sparkle and
pep. Ultimately, it's Captain Savan-
nah Monroe who deserves the
praise. Played by Tisdale, Savan-
nah is dedicated and perky but not
overbearing or disingenuous. Tis-
dale acts with such sincerity that
she begins to evoke a sympathy
and respect for cheerleading as a
sport by her first scene. Offended
by Michalka's spitting comments
when they meet, the Hellcats cap-
tain steps up to the plate for a steady
15 seconds. Yet even that moment
doesn't last, as a "goth" versus
"cheerleader" dispute erupts and
"Hellcats" once again loses steam
and relatability.
Many sports fanatics would fight
for a year-round football league, but
let's be thankful that "Hellcats" will
be forced to pack in its pom-poms
in only a couple short months. High
in attitude, but low in spirit (and
even lower in entertainment value),
"Hellcats" shouldn't expect to take
home a trophy any time soon.

criminal recruited to work for the
government, had a particularly
enduring prem-
ise. It's even
been rebooted
before on TV, but Nikita
that didn't stop T
the CW from re- Thrdy
remaking it into at9 p.m.
a bore of a show TheCW
that's been seen
a million times before.
The newest "Nikita" picks up
where the movie left off, follow-
ing a young government assassin
who wants revenge as she tries to
destroy the agency that made her
the killing machine she is.
The CW's latest attempt at
an action show has led the net-
work down the path so many
other female-led action shows
have strode down before. Nikita,
played by Maggie Q ("Mission:
Impossible III"), is the carbon
copy of 'U' alum Lucy Liu and
her cohorts in "Charlie's Angels,"
Angelina Jolie in "Tomb Raider"
and Jennifer Garner in "Alias" -
female action leads who use their
sex appeal and good looks to get
what they want while kicking
some overly stylized butt. Liter-
ally every time Nikita kills some-
one, she succeeds simply because
she's attractive. She gets into a
party because she's pretty; she
gets close to her targets because
she's wearing skimpy clothing;
her ex-boss refuses to kill her
because she's just so mesmeriz-
ing; and of course, she does it all
in seven-inch hooker heels. In
this supposed post-feminist era
of TV, it just plain sucks that in
order for a woman to be a leading
action hero, she must become a
sex object.
Besides the two steps back
for women, the show also con-
tains the corny factor that
makes all other spy shows some-
what hard to watch. The agency

Nikita once worked for is called
"Division" and everyone works
underground in super high-tech
training facilities covered in
chrome and steel. The overly dra-
matic music tries to help create
action and suspense where there
is none. And the overly elaborate
fighting scenes are so staged that
you might as well watch a WWE
wrestling match.
And to top it all off, the show
stars somewonce-upon-a-time
celebrities who clearly had a
rough fall from grace. Shane West
("A Walk to Remember") plays
Nikita's ex-boss and lover. Also,
Melinda Clarke ("The OC") plays
the Division's resident psycholo-
gist. If these stars are looking to
reboot their careers, they should
definitely be looking elsewhere.
The only thing "Nikita" has
going for it is the gripping plot
twist at the end of the pilot.
Through twists and turns it's

revealed that an unexpected fig-
ure is an integral part of Nikita's
Division take-down strategy. But
while surprising, it's hard to see
how the show will last with only
one interesting plot point per epi-
sode.
Alas, it seems the only reason
Do we need
more objectified
action actresses?
Nikita survives the first episode
is because everyone thinks she's
just too dang sexy to destroy. But
once viewers see through the
shrouds of sex and stylized vio-
lence, they will soon realize that
"Nikita" just doesn't have staying
power.

That glove is really worrisome.

"Terriers" centers around two

The Michigan Daily - michigancdaily.com

Parallels to last year abound, but this season is different

The image should still be
fresh in your mind
favored Notre Dame team,
clinging to a lead in the game's
final minute.
Michigan's
highly touted.
quarterback
leads the-
Wolverines
down the field, ,
scoring the
winning touch-
down with sec- NICOLE
onds left on the AUERBACH
clock.
No, I'm not
talking about Saturday's 28-24
victory. Let's flash back to the
2009 version - the 38-34 win,
true freshman Tate Forcier's
coming-out party.
Sure feels eerily similar, huh?
In many ways - the 2-0 start,
a smiling Rich Rodriguez, the
premature Heisman talk - it
feels just like this time last sea-
son.
But in more important ways,
this year is totally different.
First, the Wolverines' big win
over rival Notre Dame this year
was on the road. Saying South
Bend is an easy place to play is
like saying Coral Reefs is the
University's most difficult science
course.

On Saturday, led by sophomore
quarterback Denard Robinson's
502 total yards, Michigan gave
Rodriguez just his second win
outside of Ann Arbor in his two-
plus years running the program.
Already, the Wolverines have
won more games on the road than
they did all of last year, and that
bodes well for the rest of the sea-
son. Four road games remain on
the schedule: Indiana, Penn State,
Iowa and Ohio State. After Michi-
gan's clutch performance in hos-
tile Irish territory, none of those
remaining road games - yes, even
against the Buckeyes - should be
chalked up as automatic losses
anymore.
Second, Michigan's most
impressive statistic of the season:
zero turnovers.
By this point last year, Wolver-
ine quarterbacks had thrown two
interceptions, and Michigan was
on its way to losing 13 fumbles and
throwing 15 interceptions on the
season. Four of those intercep-
tions belonged to Robinson - out
of his 18 attempted passes all of
last year.
Yet here we sit, eight quarters
into the 2010 season, and Robin-
son's passing stats are breathtak-
ing: 43-of-62 for 430 yards. And
no interceptions.
Of course, it's unlikely that

trend keeps up all season (pinch
me if it does), but it's an impres-
sive start. Not only has Robinson's
passing gotten crisper, it's gotten
more accurate. Opponents can't
expect Michigan to make mis-
takes like they did before.
That brings me to the final dif-
ference: The Wolverines know
how their bright 4-0 start last
season fizzled into a disappoint-
ing 5-7 final record. They've been
2-0 before. They've been ranked.
They know how to not let last year
happen again.
Part of that is making sure dis-
tractions like media attention and
hype are kept at a distance.
"Probably, if you asked half the
players on the team, they wouldn't
even know that we're ranked right
now," senior cornerback James
Rogers said. "We're just trying
to stay out of the newspapers
and stuff like that and don't even
worry about it."
The players don't seem con-
cerned about attention these
days, but there remains a sense
of urgency around this program.
Rodriguez knows winning erases
complaints, and the hot seat he
started the season in has cooled
considerably with the 2-0 start.
But nobody - particularly Rodri-
guez - wants to see the team col-
lapse again.

This offseason, the Wolverines
focused on learning the playbook,
gaining experience - all the cli-
ch6 things. But they've proven
they're more than talk. Robinson
has developed chemistry with his
wide receivers, and the offensive
and defensive lines have gotten
stronger.
Those are just examples of the

team's growth. Each step of that
process helps distance this squad
from last year's.
"We're getting better as people
can see," senior defensive tackle
Greg Banks said. "We can see it in
ourselves a lot more than usual.
Not to say that we weren't believ-
ing in ourselves (last year), it's
just that we're starting to find our

identity as a team now."
And that identity - untied
shoelaces and all - just feels
really different from last year's,
which could make the rest of this
season a whole lot more enjoyable
than the last.

1219 receiving yards and five touch-
downs in his sophomore and junior
years, while earning a reputation
as a thunderous blocker. But when
Edwards graduated to the NFL at
the end of Avant's junior year, it was
time for the team player to become
a team leader.
"My senior year was really hec-
tic for me," Avant said. "Here I was,
used to having a security blanket in
Braylon, with him receiving all the
attention, allowing me to have one-
on-one coverage. Now I'm the guy*
who's being doubled, the guy who is
the key focus of the defense as Bray-
ion was."
Avant's senior year was bitter-
sweet. On a personal level, it was a
fantastic year, as he racked up 82
catches, 1,007 receiving yards and
eight touchdowns. But on the team
level it was a tough year, as Michi-
gan struggled to a 7-5 record after
beginning the season with national'
championship dreams. Avant's
four years of selfless play did not
go unnoticed though, as he won
the prestigious Bo Schembechler
Award, given to Michigan's most
valuable player.
"When I think about it, I can
almost cry," Avant said. "Not
because the award meant that
much, but that Jesus Christ helped
lead me from a terrible situation
that I was in to graduate from
Michigan. Winning the Bo Schem-
bechler Award, the most presti-
gious award for an athlete in our
school, to see some of the guys on
the trophy list, it was just a hum-
bling experience."
Coming off a 1,000-yard sea-
son at Michigan, one would have
expected Avant's stock among NFL
scouts to be sky-high. But the NFL
Draft process was a difficult one
for him. While Avant's talents were
obvious on tape, his measurables
didn't scream high draft pick. A
4.73 40-yard dash time caused him
to fall to the fourth round of the
2006 NFL Draft, where the Phila-
delphia Eagles snatched him up.
Thankful for being drafted, but
angry for seeing receivers he felt
worse than him drafted ahead,
Avant looked at his fourth-round
selection as an opportunity. He
could prove himself as an under-
dog, that with hard work and faith,
anything is possible.

His rookie season was spent
working relentlessly to make a
talented Eagles team coming off
a Super Bowl appearance. Train-
ing camp went without getting
that dreaded call to drop off his
playbook, but earning a roster spot
didn't satisfy him. After a run of
wide receivers who steered away
from contact, Avant endeared him-
self to both the coaching staff and
Eagles fans by showing no fear in
going across the middle to catch
passes. His blue-collar style both on
and off the field made him a Philly
favorite.
After seeing no playing time
throughout much of his rookie sea-
son, Avant finally opened up eyes
after getting his first TD on New
Years Eve against the Falcons. His
patience paid off, as he entered his
second season as a key slot receiver
in the Eagles' pass-heavy offense.
His star has been steadily on the
rise since, going from 23 catches
in 2007-08 to 32 catches in 2008-
09 to 41 catches last season. Along
with two talented young receiv-
ers in DeSean Jackson and Jeremy
Maclin, Avant has emerged as part
of one of the most feared trios in
the NFL, acting as a mentor to the
phenoms.
Still playing off of his smaller-
than-expected fourth round rookie
salary, the Eagles rewarded Avant
with a new five-year contract exten-
sion. Never one to overtly show his
wealth, Avant was happy not only
for the security given to him and
his wife, Stacy, but the ability to
give back through the social work
he does with his church. Never for-
getting his own rough upbringing,
Avant is constantly looking to help
give at-risk youth an opportunity to
succeed.
It's 4:15 p.m. in Philadelphia.
The Eagles are facing the Pack-
ers to open the season. With a
new contract in tow and role as
the Eagles' go-to receiver on third
down, things have never been more
settled for the man from the Alt-
geld Projects. Still, the nerves from
running out onto Lincoln Financial
Field in front of 67,000 screaming
fans remains. He tells himself a
prayer he says every game:
"Lord, I thank you. I'm not going
to be fearful or scared of anyone out
here, as you are with me."

ason Avant is pissed off.
He's an All-American, so
why is he sitting on the
bench he thinks? No. 9
Washington is on the oppo-
site sideline, and he should be tak-
ing apart their secondary. Sure, he
ran out and touched the banner in
front of the 111,OOO-plus crowd, but
if he's not playing, it doesn't matter.
He spends the first quarter glued
to the bench, grumbling to himself
about the injustice that has been
done to him. He looks around for
fellow freshman receiver Steve
Breaston, who knows what Avant's
going through. But Breaston's not
sitting on the bench, he's up on the
sideline, yelling and cheering. This
freshman is being redshirted - he
can't play this entire year - and he's
the one excited?
Avant's not going to be the one
complaining while his friend is fired
up, so he rises and joins Breaston. It
all begins to soak in: the crowd, the
tradition and his teammates laying
it all on the line. He begins to cheer,
pulling for his teammates in a tight
game. When Phillip Brabbs hits a
44-yard field goal as time expires,
Avant runs on the field in jubilation
with the rest of his teammates.
"I understood what being a
Michigan Man was all about,"
Avant said in an interview with
the Daily. "It wasn't about my tal-
ent anymore, it wasn't about me
being the best football player, but
me encouraging my university, me
encouraging my teammates, and
that was the change in my career."
It's a Sunday, so Avant is going
with his Granny to church. Not that
he has much of a choice, lest he face
the wrath of her bible and belt. Lillie
Avant, known as Granny to the rest
of the neighborhood, raised Avant
his entire life. His mother dropped
him as a baby and never came back.
His father, Jerry Avant, was in and
out of prison. A stern woman with
a strong faith, Granny raised her
grandson as if he were her son.
Their neighborhood was the
Altgeld Gardens Projects on the

South Side of Chicago, a place most
famous for its asbestos. There were
drugs and opportunities to go down
the wrong path, but Granny's faith
kept Avant on the right side of the
tracks, praying for him every time
he went out.
Like most kids growing up in the
Windy City in the era of Jordan's
Bulls, Avant's game was basketball.
And a bailer he was, beating older
guys on the playground, taking
their money and pride in the pro-
cess. It wasn't until his sophomore
year at Carver High School that he
became a football player.
Carver was short on athletes and
funds, so Avant's basketball coach
- who held the same position with
the football team - made an ulti-
matum: if you want to play basket-
ball, you're going to have to play
football.
Avant's football career got off
to an inauspicious start. After one
day of the fullback repeatedly pop-
ping him, he quit. He didn't want
to get hit. But Granny wasn't about
to let Avant give up after one day.
She convinced him to go back out
with the squad. With his position
switched to running back, Avant
started to like the game a little bit
more.
In his junior year, Avant switched
positions again, this time to wide
receiver. And quite the receiver
he was, setting school records in
receptions, receiving yards and
touchdowns. Within two years of
first playing football, Avant was an
High School All-American.
New to the game of football,
Avant wasn't exactly well-versed in
the recruiting and rah-rah tradition
of college football. But he knew of
this program with history, Michi-
gan, and he remembered Charles
Woodson smiling with a rose in his
mouth. His interest was piqued, so
he began to look into the program.
Its winning ways and high aca-
demic profile only furthered his
admiration. When Lloyd Carr came
calling, Avant couldn't resist sign-
ing with the national champion-
ship-winning coach.
"I thought Coach Carr was genu-

ine," Avant said. "I thought he was
tough and I thought he went out of
his way to come out to the projects,
where most of the coaches were
scared to come and visit me."
After a freshman year dedicated
to getting stronger and faster, Avant
entered his sophomore year looking
to emerge a star after having only
two catches in his Michigan career.
But that stardom wasn't going to
come any time soon, as Braylon
Edwards had emerged as the lead-
ing man of the receiving crew after
a 1,035-yard, ten-touchdown sea-
son. Anyone who had known Avant
as a hot-headed All-American a year
before would have expected sullen
response to the thought of playing
second fiddle. But two events in
Avant's freshman year changed his
mindset: the Washington game and
the reemergence of his faith.
At the end of his first year at
Michigan, Avant submitted himself

wholly to Christ. His outlook had
changed.
"It was no longer aboutegoing out
and catching ten passes a game, me
being this and me being that, and
trying to do it on my own," Avant
says. "My mindset was, 'Lord,
whatever you give me, I'll be satis-
fied. I just want to play my hardest
so when people look at me, they'll
see you playing."'
No more complaining to quarter-
back John Navarre about not get-
ting enough passes, because Avant
understood now what his playing
meant. He was not only playing for
God, he was playing for all those
who didn't get out of the Garden
Projects, those in the drug game,
locked up or dead from the fast
life. He practiced what his receiv-
ers coach Erik Campbell preached:
'Never count catches. Only count
wins.'
In an era of big-ego wide receiv-
ers, Avant was the ultimate team
player, quietly gaining a combined

Jason Avant played for the Wolverines from 2002-2005. He garnered ,007 yards
as a senior and was drafted in the fourth round by the Philadelphia Eagles.

8B The Statement // Wednesday September 15, 2010
PERSONALSTATEMENT

A RATIONALE RECONSIDERED
BY NOVE~l E hA Fl POUR

Don't Tell" debate. Some conserva-
tive organizations have supported the
repeal, like the Log Cabin Republicans,
whose case against the policy won in
a federal court last Thursday. Others
haven't gotten the message, and the
FRC report shows how backward con-
servatives' logic can be when it comes to
issues like sexual assault and sexuality.
Their logic amounts to this: there are
more male-on-male sexual assaults in
the military than in the general popula-
tion while there shouldn't be an unusu-
ally high number of homosexuals in
the military. Therefore, increasing the
number of homosexuals would increase
the number of same-gender sexual
assaults.
This rationale fails

ast May, the conservative think
tank, Family Research Council,
released a report concluding
that a repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
would further increase the already
abnormally high rate of male-on-male
sexual assaults in the military. The
organization, which often feeds talking
points to right-wing politicians and pas-
tors, said they believe this will happen
because openly gay men in the military
will be incapable of resisting their com-
rades.
This typical stereotyping of gay men
as perversely promiscuous offended
those who support LGBT rights. How-
ever, I was primarily offended as a man
who once during an overnight school
trip in high school woke up to an arm
draped across my body.
My experience mirrors some of the
anecdotes the FRC offers as evidence
of the evils of gay men in the military.
In the report's dry, emotionless tone, it
would sound something like this: Vic-
tim awoke in motel bed to the assail-
ant's noticeably small penis wedged
inside the victim's buttocks, gyrating
in and out. I don't believe my clothes
were removed, nor that my assailant
ejaculated, but that didn't matter. The
memory of him breathing down my
neck and relaxing his arm on my side
still feels more terrifying than any-
thing sexual that happened. He'd vio-
lated me, and I'd been too unconscious
to stop him.
What felt worst of all, though, was
the immediate sense of shame. Two

in conditions non-con-
ducive to an intimate
relationship of any kind,
let alone one with a woman when the
military's gender ratio remains unbal-
anced. This isn't to say that soldiers are
secretly gay or that sexual frustration
leads to sexual assault, but rather that
homoerotic tensions can exist between
straight men and even the most honor-
able of soldiers can still make dishonor-
able decisions.
If the FRC genuinely cared about
male-on-male sexual assaults, they
wouldn't single out gay men as its
cause. Hurtful actions and decisions
make a person an assailant, not sexu-
ality. Inevitably, soldiers choose to
assault their comrades because they
believe they can get away with it, and
when the victims are men, I believe
assailants realize the crime isn't likely
to get reported. Interestingly enough,
the FRC believes this too and includ-
ed it in their report: "...homosexual
assault cases are probably less likely
to be reported, given the stigma that a

heterosexual soldier might feel about
having been homosexually assaulted."
Unlike the FRC, I believe "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" creates the stigma.
Because the military sees homosexual
relations as wrong, male soldiers who
become victims are more likely to
feel shame or blame themselves. This
seems especially the case for victims
who may have previously felt homo-
erotic feelings. They fear being per-
ceived as less of a man or gay, when
really, they should only fear not telling
and nobody asking.
Personally, I wish I hadn't been
afraid. I would have let someone know
about the assault and possibly even
reported it, making the whole thing into
a much less drawn out ordeal. Instead,
despite attending a public high school
in oh-so-liberal California, I told no one
until my sophomore year of college, two
years after it happened. In the military,
where a stated policy enforces a fear
of gayness, the pressure for victims to
remain silent increases, and in turn,
increases their pain.
In bringing up the topic of male-on-
male sexual assault, the FRC has cho-
sen to politicize something they seem
to know little about. However, doing so
has provided an opportunity to change
the discourse. If we must stigmatize a
group, we should object to sexual pred-
ators, notgay men, and realize the two
groups are entirely different.
Repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" is
just one step in the right direction. It
will allow the military to confront the
homoerotic tensions that arise in any
organization - high schools, churches
and yes, even fraternities. Hopefully
the repeal will allow all American citi-
zens, straight or otherwise, to better
confront the complexities of their own
sexualities, encouraging a safe envi-
ronment in which nobody has to feel
ashamed. U

Michigan be successful."
And focusing on his role as provost
is something Hanlon is certainly doing.
Waking up at 5:20 each morning
and working for about an hour at home
before coming into the office, where
he typically works until 6 p.m., means
that Hanlon's not left with much free
time to think about anything other
than the University.
"I try not to spend the whole eve-
ning working, but I usually do a little

work at night too," Hanlon said laugh-
ing, adding that he couldn't imagine
doing this job if his children weren't
grown up. "My wife is very patient
with me."
Having taken over as provost just
two and a half months ago, Hanlon
already has a lot on his plate - includ-
ing work that's both a continuation
of what Sullivan left behind and new
ideas he hopes to implement.
Hanlon said typically a major
responsibility of a University provost
is to closely monitor and plan the Uni-
versity's budget around increasingly
complex budget negotiations in the
state legislature, something he plans to
make a priority as well.

"Continuing fiscal stability has to be
job one,"he says, before saying he wants
to talk about something "more fun."
And what Hanlon considers "fun"
is research. Mind you, this is the man
that Sullivan described as having "in
some ways a dull story, in some ways
a nice story" and who Coleman said
though typically seen as "very serious"
also "has a droll sense of humor."
"I'm very interested in how we as
a university can deploy our research
breadth to tackle complex world prob-
lems," Hanlon said. "And we do some
now, but if there's one thing I'd like to
elevate, it's that type of activity."
That activity could, among many
other areas, include the revitalization

and preservation of the Great Lakes -
something Hanlon says the University
is uniquely positioned to help with.
"There's a major federal effort to
restore the Great Lakes ... and involved
in that is the necessity to solve a whole
lot of technical problems," Hanlon
said, explaining that the University
could offer assistance and learning
opportunities in areas including biol-
ogy, chemistry, economics and public
policy. "We have the resources and the
affinity."
However, Hanlon says the Great
Lakes are just one example of how the
University could turn the real world
into more of a classroom and help stu-
dents not only learn through real prac-

tice, but also directly impact the world
in a positive way.
"We educate a really large num-
ber of very high quality students. We
just have terrific students here," Han-
Ion said. "And they're going to go out,
many of them here, and land in posi-
tions of influence and land in poaitions
where they have the opportunity to
make a difference in the world.
"I feel like the way our University
can most impact the world is through
our graduates and what they do when
they leave here," Hanlon continued.
"The way we teach them to view the
world is going to make all the differ-
ence in the way they act once they get
out into the world."

TH EJUNKD RAWER
random student interview

This is Will Grundler from
The Michigan Daily. We're
reintroducing a feature
called Random Student Interview.
Would you like to participate?
Yes.
State your name for the record.
Kristen [name redacted].
What do you like best about the
Daily?
I like the Sudoku.
The Sudoku? Not the award-win-
ningjournalism?
That's nice too. I mean, um ... yeah
the Sudoku.
Some have criticized the Daily
of being too funny and light-
humored. Do you disagree?
I disagree. I don't think they're too
funny. You're saying you need to be
more serious?
Moving on. So you know when
you're sitting in class and you
drop a pencil or pen and you
don't want to take your eyes off
the professor or the PowerPoint
to go look for it? So you grope
around without looking and you

never find it. And once you bend
down and do look for it it's a mil-
lion miles away?
Yeah.
What are your thoughts on that?
Well, hopefully someone around me
is nice enough to take their eyes off
whatever is going on to find the pen-
cil for me.
Is it acceptable inany situation for
a male student to cross his legs and
talk about literature at the same
time? Or are the two mutually
exclusive?
Why wouldn't it be acceptable to do
that at the same time?
Do you know what mutually exclu-
sive means?
Is this a trick question?
Just answer the question.
Sure. Sure it's fine. It might look a
little pretentious, but it's fine.
Do you believe in evolution?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Really? So you think we just came
to be at random? Do you think us

meeting is just chance, that life is
chance?
Yeah. I do actually.
On a related note, what makes
your life worth living? Cause it's
the subject of the theme semester.
And try to answer seriously.
Wow, that's pretty deep right there ...
Let me just stop you right there.
So you know when you're walking
on campus and another person is
walking inyour direction and even
though you're a good distance
away from each other it's always
at the last minute that you decide
to get out of each others' way and
you move in the same direction as
each other?
Yeah.
Do you think that's what makes
life worth living?
No. That's not what makes life worth
living.
Human contact?
Well yeah, human contact but not in
that form.
Oh, so sexual intercourse?
No. I'm not talking about sex. I'm

talking about love. Families. Spiritual
connections with people.
OK. So what major do you think
stands the least chance of getting
a girlfriend?
I guess it depends. If it were me I
would least date an undecided major.
Because they don't know what they
want in life and I need someone with
some sort of direction.
Is it ever acceptable for a male
student to wear socks above his
ankles and if the answer is no,
what sort of ridicule should he be
subjected to?
Is he wearingshorts?
Yes. That's a given.
It's not acceptable. Well ... is he hik-
ing?
No. Just walking to class.
It depends on how badly I feel for the
kid. If he wears his socks like that
over his ankles and it looks like his
mom told him to do that then I feel
pretty badly for him. But if he's doing
that on his own..

collegiate ranks quickly began.
By the end of Zimmerman's sopho-
more year of high school, Rosen said
Lexi's improvement caught his eye.
But the Rosens were behind when it
came to Lexi's recruitment. By the
time they had begun to recruit Zim-
merman, the coaching duo thought it
would be too late to get her.
But the Rosens were persistent
with the highly-touted Zimmerman
and ultimately convinced her to visit
Ann Arbor before her junior season
in August 2005. Once she arrived,
Rosen said, "it was one of those
things where you could feel it being
the right fit."
Zimmerman said this past May
that she wholeheartedly felt she
"needed" to come to Michigan - to
a place where maybe winning wasn't
the main objective. She said she
wanted to share the same values as
the coaches who would be instruct-
ing her for the next four years.
So, after not being on Michigan's
radar for too long, and without the
usual back-and-forth correspondence
of an already-established relation-
ship, Zimmerman had the Wolver-
ines' attention.
But there was one minor hiccup.
Another setter had the attention
of both Rosens long before they had
grown keen on acquiring Zimmer-
man, and they had already offered
the other player a scholarship, who
had not yet made a decision. But,
Rosen said, he liked Lexi better.
Rosen, however, had to be fair to
all parties. So, when Lexi asked him
what would happen if both she and
the other setter told him they wanted
to go to Michigan, he told her they
would take the other player because
"it's the fair thing to do."
But that didn't scare off Lexi. Fol-
lowing her unofficial visit from Ann
Arbor, Zimmerman notified Mark
that she wanted to be a Wolverine.
'I didn't realize what I would be
missing out on until I went on my
visit," Zinsmserman said. "And then
I said there was no way I was going
anywhere else."
The other setter was notified
about Michigan's interest in Zim-
merman, but she still wasn't ready
to commit, even after a couple
month's deliberation.
The Rosens then offered the
position to Zimmerman - boom -
game time.
There were about five setters
that everyone was recruiting in
the Midwest that year and once
Lexi committed to Michigan, the
rest "decided within the next three
days," Rosen said.
'It was like bam, bam, bam - she
got that thing going," Rosen said.
"You just didn't want to be the team
- it's like musical chairs - you
didn't want to be the team without
a chair."

ALWAYS HAPPY, NEVER SATISFIED
After Zimmerman received treat-
ment on her nagging right thumb -
which she injured in mid-October
last year at Michigan State - she
made her way over to the far end
zone of Cliff Keen Arena and fielded
a series of questions regarding her
three-plus years as a Wolverine.
The writing was on the wall, liter-
ally.
Sweet 16. Sweet 16. Elite Eight.
Those are the end results of Zim-
merman's first three years under
Rosen, a period of unprecedented
success for any Michigan volleyball
team in its almost 40 years of exis-
tence.
And with all three banners hang-
ing on the concrete wall adjacent to
the electronic scoreboard, Zimmer-
man could see the product of the
Wolverines' diligence during off-sea-
son workouts, the adversity they had
faced over the course of the season's
four-plus months and their commit-
ment to raising the bar of excellence,
when the bar hadn't even been lifted
yet.
None of those wins last season was
more impressive and more notewor-
thy than Michigan's three-set sweep
of No. 4 seed Stanford in the Sweet
16, not to mention the match was
played on the Cardinals' home floor
in Palo Alto, Calif.
When Zimmerman answered a
question about the significance of the
victory - which pushed the Wolver-
ines into the field of eight - she belt-
ed out an emphatic "Hell yeah." With
the two-word response, it's obvious
what kind of impact the win had on
the progress of the Michigan volley-
ball program, from where it has come
since the start of the Mark Rosen era

in 1999, and even spanning a shorter
time frame, the Lexi Zimmerman
era.
The banners, and what they stand
for, have had a big impact on Zim-
merman. But they also show her how
much further the team could go.
"We're all happy with the success
we've had and what we've accom-
plished, but it's made us realize that
if we can raise the bar to become a
team that consistently makes it to the
Sweet 16, then we can raise the bar
again and be ateam that goes a little
bit farther," she said. "The better you
get, the harder it is to get a little bit
better."
Without former Wolverines like
Beth Karpiak (2009) and Megan
Bower (2010), Michigan wouldn't
have made its way into national
contention, nor would it have gar-
nered the same amount of success
in the past three seasons. But look-
ing beyond Karpiak and Bower, only
one name comes to mind when con-
sidering the greatest influence on
Michigan volleyball: two-time AVCA
All-American Lexi Zimmerman.
"There's no question that she's had
the most impact on elevating our pro-
gram of anybody in the history of the
program," Rosen said.
Before arriving in Ann Arbor in
the fall of 2007, Zimmerman was
touted as the nation's No. 1 ranked
high school recruit. And now, in her
fourth and final year at Michigan
with an assist total of 4,916, Zimmer-
man will soon crush Linnea Men-
doza's all-time assist record of 5,072.
The list of the number of accom-
plishments she will eventually gar-
ner as a Wolverine goes on and on,
her most recent being selected as the

Year. While Zimmerman will prob-
ably need another shelf or two at her
home in Barrington, Illinois to house
all her hardware, the awards and
honors aren't what motivate the out-
spoken and charismatic Zimmerman.
"We see past that banner there,"
said volleyball player Alex Hunt,
pointing to Zimmerman's AVCA All-
America second team banner inside
Cliff Keen, which she earned her
sophomore season. "She doesn't hang
her hat on that being up there. It's as
if that means nothing to her. I mean,
I'm sure it does, but it's not what she
lives on everyday."
So, what does motivate the once
Gatorade Player of the Year?
According to Zimmerman, she
wanted to seize the opportunity to
come to Michigan in order to take a
program to where it had never been
before, and to finally bring Michigan
onto the national stage.
To help bring the program its best
season ever, advancing the team to
the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, was just icing on the cake.

Abuzz of uncertainty and skep-
ticism swept across volleyball
message boards, blog websites
and media outlets on August 24, 2007.
According to the national critics, the
Michigan volleyball husband-wife
coaching tandem of Mark and Leisa
Rosen was making a mistake.
The subject of such hotly-contest-
ed debate: then-freshmen setter Lexi
Zimmerman.
"On the Internet, all the blogs were,
like, 'What are the Rosens thinking,
starting a freshmen? They're going to
hurt her for life because she's going
to be so scared out there,' " Lori Zim-
merman, Lexi's mother, reminisced
about her daughter's first collegiate
match in front of almost 7,500 fans.
Disregarding her freshman sta-
tus, current senior Lexi catapulted
the Wolverines to a five-set victory,
in which she tallied 64 assists and 13
digs in her debut donning the maize
and blue.
And the number of doubters and
the negative attention the Rosens
received for their unprecedented
decision, well, that's all history now,
as Zimmerman is on pace to become
Michigan's all-time assist leader in
the next two weeks. And according
to Rosen, she will graduate "this year
being the best all-time player in the
history of Michigan."
Coming to Michigan her freshmen
year ranked as the top setter in the
country, Zimmerman said she real-
ized within 20 minutes of being in
the gym her first preseason day that
holding the number one position in
a recruiting class meant absolutely

nothing.
"I definitely came in knowing I was
going to have to work really, really
hard to step my game up because
the level was so much higher," Zim-
merman said. "And I was still blown
away."
Zimmerman has dedicated a signif-
icant amount of her life to volleyball
ever since Scott Harris, her club vol-
leyball coach, can remember.
"She was what I call the gym rat,"
said Harris, coach of the northern
Illinois-based Sky High Volleyball
club. "She was in the gym as much as
you wanted her to be. She couldn't get
enough of it."
Harris recognized Zimmerman at
an early age as "one of the most ath-
letic and dynamic setters" he had ever
seen. From a young age, she proved
herself as extremely talented and able
to improve at a rate that surpassed
most other players.
From the end of middle school to
her final season as a Wolverine, Zim-
merman has continued to set the
precedent for what it means to be
the best player in the gym. While it is
certainly hard to quantify 'the best,'
anyone who has been following the
Wolverines over the last few seasons
can identify the player who has been
at the heart of all the success.
To the surprise of no one, the
"little, skinny kid" - as Mark Rosen
described Zimmerman - has
remained among the country's top
setters, leading the nation last year
with 1,516 assists.
"The majors for athleticism -
speed, agility, hand-eye coordination,
balance, explosion - all those things,
she's off the charts," Rosen said.

"She's got the intangible qualities.
She's a great competitor, she plays
great under pressure.
"When's it's crunch time, she just
finds ways to win," he continued.
"That's the recipe, that's what you're
looking for in players."
Upon arriving at Michigan, Zim-
merman had a solid foundation for
the art of setting, with a high atten-
tion-to-detail mindset but with very
little latitude with which to play her
position. After quickly identifying her
as a "free spirit," Rosen allowed Zim-
merman a little latitude at first. Then,
after realizing she could still perform
well, allotted her more and more free-
dom with distributing the ball.
But even with a little latitude, Zim-
merman is still learning on the fly to
elevate her game. And that all starts
with practice.
When it comes to being able to
truly dedicate herself to volleyball for
the two hours a day when the team
practices - as the coaches tell the
whole team to do - Lexi does a great
job, according junior libero Sloane
Donhoff.
"When's she's in herefor twohours,
she'll go hard for two hours," Donhoff
said. "She'll come in here and she's
going hard all the time, everyday."
And for Zimmerman, who admits
to being a reaction player - she says
she sets the ball without really doing
a whole lot of thinking - the time in
the gym has proven invaluable. Rosen
and the coaching staff have focused
on helping her understand why and in
what circumstances to make certain
decisions.
This has proven to be a relatively
easy task, according to Rosen. Despite

MUSICAL CHAIRS
And the school without a chair is...
Michigan.
OK, well, almost.
By her sophomore year at Bar-
rington High School in Illinois, Zim-
merman had already caught the
attention of many other schools -
some had even contacted her as early
as the eighth grade. But the nation's
top setter of the 2007 recruiting class
still hadn't caught Michigan's atten-
tion.
Enter Stanford University.
As a player on one of Sports Perfor-
mance's Under-14 teams - the volley-
ball club Zimmerman played for prior
to switching back to Sky High her
sophomore season - she received her
first piece of contact from any Divi-
sion I school.
"Getting letters from coaches, it
kind of opened my eyes and made
me realize that I could continue
with (volleyball), which is awesome
because it's definitely something I
love doing," Zimmerman said. "If
there's someone that wants me to play
for them, I'm there."
Once the letters and questionnaires
started arriving on the Zimmermans'
doorstep, the discussion about Lexi

After 24 years at the Ur

professor to University Provost. His
predecessor, like many before her, is
now leading another prestigious uni-
versity. Here's an in-depth look at the
decision to pick Hanlon for the post;
and what he hopes to accomplish in it.

campus.
Yet, for as much grinning and hand
shaking as Hanlon may do and as many
presentations as he may give, the lack
of name recognition on campus for the
post of University Provost and the man
who now holds the position isn't sur-
prising. To some degree, it also has to
do with the personality often found in
the individuals who hold the position, a.
personality that is exemplified in Han-
lon's personality. -
His personality is exemplified. by
sense of duty through servant leader-
ship and it's clear that Hanlon, like
many of his predecessors and peers at
other universities across the country,
sets aside his own interests to genuinely
consider different perspectives.
Leaning back in his chair during
a recent meeting with a group of his
senior staff to discuss strategic plan-
ning initiatives, Hanlon was comfort-
able listening to the group's opinions
before verbalizing any of his own. Then,
leaning forward and putting his arms
straight in front of himself on the table,
Hanlon shared his own ideas.
But his philosophy of inclusion, and
the value he places on making sure
issues are given the proper consid-
eration, means he doesn't stop there.
Picking up his pen, he scribbled down
notes when one of his vice provosts
countered his idea with another. Han-
lon didn't interrupt and didn'tlook at all
perturbed when one of his employees
contradicted his original idea. Instead,
Hanlon waved his hands lightly and
asked another question before agreeing
to move forward with the new plan.
But while Hanlon was quickly con-
vinced in the meeting simply by allow-
ing his senior advisors to brainstorm
with him, there's one thing that seems
to grab Hanlon's attention more than
anything, something that Hanlon him-
self admits frequently convinces him of
his course of action - numbers.

hen news broke earlier this
year that former Univer-

ginia in August, one question rang in

Hanlon and Sullivan a,

Thurnau professorship.
In 2001, Hanlon was given an
endowed professorship, being named
the Donald J. Lewis professor of mathe-
matics. The same year, Hanlon received
his first administrative post, becoming
the associate dean for planning and
finance at the College of Literature, Sci-
ence and the Arts - a position which
Hanlon says he never expected to be in.
"That was an opportunity that just
landed unexpectedly in front of me,"
Hanlon said.
From there, the math professor con-
tinued to rise in the administrative
ranks, moving just down the hall from
his current office in 2004 to become
associate provost for academic and bud-
getary affairs. In 2007 he was promoted
to vice provost.
Then, on July 1, Hanlon moved to the
corner-office reserved for the provost.
But such a rise from academic to
administrator was never part of the
plan.
"I had no deliberate plan to do
administrative work," he said. "I wish I
could say there was a big plan and that
I followed the plan, but I didn't. It just
sort of, well, things happen and oppor-
tunities arise."
While Hanlon's original career goals
never included becoming a university
administrator, having academic types
lead institutions of higher education
isn't anythingunusual. According to the
academic who leads the University, it's a
logical choice, too.
"I think particularly at the provost

level, well, even at the presidential level,
I think this is true, that for faculty to see
somebody who has combined skills of
both being a great scholar, a great teach-
er and being able to have people skills,
management skills, to conceive strategy

chemistry and was on the faculty at the
University of Kentucky for 19 years.
"Ultimately, the Provost's Office is
the one that ends up making the tenure
decisions, so for the faculty to be confi-
dent of someone in that position ... that's
just a plus," she continued.
Former University Provost Teresa
Sullivan, now the president at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, agreed.
"Phil, as chief academic officer,
really has to understand the issues on
the academic side of the house and that
includes issues like teaching and curric-
ulum and how you deploy faculty time
and also about research," Sullivan said
earlier this month. "All that is integral
to deploying the full academic resourc-
es of the University. So I think that is the
reason that most universities continue
to look for high-achieving academics
in the administration, particular in the
provost's position."
Sullivan also pointed out that other

University officials - like Tim Slottow,
the University's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer, who
does not handle academic affairs at the
University - tend to hold degrees in
more traditional management areas like
business.
On the other hand, Hanlon, who
echoed many of
Coleman's and Sul-
e re was livan's comments,
said it is concerning
ollowed that higher educa-
tion institutions
don't have more
bench strength on
the administrative
side.
"I think it's, you ask an interesting
question, because we have weak train-
ing, weak succession planning for our
administration and leadership," Hanlon
said when asked how universities are
served by having academics lead them.
"It is a miracle, I think sometimes, that
universities do run well because you
have people landing in positions who've
had no training, no formal training
almost, to do what they do. And I'm an
example."
As Hanlon described it, there's noset
"path" for academics to become admin-
istrators. However, once an academic
becomes an administrator, they often
continue to rise through the ranks -
something that's true in the cases of
Hanlon, Sullivan and Coleman. And
once appointed provost, many continue
to rise to the position of university pres-

ident.
Sullivan left over the summer to
assume the presidency atthe University
of Virginia. Former University Provost
Nancy Cantor, who served from 1997
to 2001, left the University to assume
the presidency at Syracuse University.
Prior to that, Bernard Machen left the
University after two years as provost to
assume the presidency at the University
of Florida. Charles Vest also served as
the University's provost for a little over
a year before becoming the president at
the National Academy of Engineering.
Others, like James Duderstadt and Har-
old Shapiro, served as University pro-
vosts before being promoted to serve as
the Universitys presidents.
Asked whether Hanlon had the "right
stuff" to become a university president
down the line, Sullivan said she thought
that he did.
"Well, it certainly would not surprise
me," Sullivan said. "I think it's not an
unusual career path. It's not inevitable,
and I understand there's something
of a trend in the United States now for
provosts to decide they don't want to be
presidents. So there are some who don't,
but there certainly are a good number
who do."
However, when asked whether it was
an ambition of his to become a univer-
sity president some day, Hanlon gave a
more indirect answer.
"Well, I'm, let me be provost first,"
Hanlon said with a laugh. "I've only
been provost for two months and right
now I'm just really focused on being
successful and helping the University of

Provost = President?
Many who have served as the Univer-
sity's provost have gone on to become
university presidents at leading insti-
tutions across the country. This trend
isn't unique to the University of Michi-
gan, however. At many institutions, the
position has been used as a launching
pad for academic presidencies.
