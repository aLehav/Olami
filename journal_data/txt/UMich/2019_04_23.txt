In the past academic year, the 
Office for Institutional Equity, 
the entity on campus charged 
with investigating complaints of 
discrimination and harassment, 
has been widely talked about on 
campus. After a ruling by the 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 
September 2018, OIE had to change 
its policy regarding student sexual 
misconduct complaints to include 
an in-person hearing between the 

accused and the accuser. 
In October 2018, The Daily 
published an article following 
a student survivor of sexual 
assault’s 
painful 
experience 
going through OIE’s reporting 
process. In November 2018, The 
Daily investigated the University 
granting 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance professor David Daniels 
tenure after a student reported 
an instance of Daniels’ sexual 
harassment to OIE.
In light of this heightened 
conversation surrounding OIE and 

the reporting process, The Daily 
sat down with Jeffery Frumkin, 
OIE 
interim 
senior 
director, 
and Elizabeth Seney, OIE senior 
associate director and interim 
Title IX coordinator, to talk about 
OIE’s mission, its new policy, its 
investigator training processes and 
other areas of interest.
The Michigan Daily: What 
would you say OIE’s overarching 
mission is in helping the campus 
community? What are the office’s 
priorities in investigations?
Elizabeth 
Seney: 
For 
the 

first question, I would say the 
overarching mission really is to 
make sure that the University is 
responding fairly and appropriately 
to concerns that exist. Then, 
of course we also have a role in 
preventive and educational work 
as well. So I wouldn’t limit our 
overall mission to just responding 
to particular concerns, but I would 
say that is where we spend a lot of 
our time and efforts and that’s a 
significant priority. And that really 
is in making sure that the process 
is designed and conducted in a way 

that there’s broad access to make 
reports, broad access to engage in 
either an investigative process or 
whatever might be the appropriate 
and requested resolution, and that 
all of those processes are both 
legally compliant but also meet the 
needs of the community, so they’re 
fair. People are being treated with 
respect throughout the process … 
not causing more harm as much as 
that is possible. I would say that’s 
the overall mission.

The 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization has accused the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance of moving to reduce 
course loads for two lecturers 
following 
LEO’s 
successful 
bargaining campaign last year.
According to LEO, the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance is 
trying to shift classes taught 
by lecturers Missy Beck and 
Jean-Claude Biza to tenure-
track faculty in order to avoid 
paying lecturers more under the 
contract the union ratified over 
the summer. 
Beck, who has taught at the 
University for more than 15 years, 
said she was told her course 

load would be reduced after she 
emailed Anita Gonzalez, interim 
chair of the Department of 
Dance, in February asking about 
scheduling sections of a ballet 
course.
“That’s where she replied that 
she didn’t even know if I’m going 
to be teaching next year,” Beck 
said. “So I wrote back to say, 
‘What’s going on, if it’s me, if it’s 
my performance, I would love to 
talk to you about that. This was 
my mission, teaching students 
and teaching people, so if there 
is something I could be doing 
better, please let me know.’”
Beck said she was told SMTD 
intended to have tenure-track 
faculty take over the classes she 
had previously taught.
“It was a bit condescending,” 

Beck said. “At one point when 
they said, ‘You’ve been helping 
us out, you’ve been so generous 
to take those classes, but now 
we need to give them back to 
the people who they belong to.’”
Following 
a 
months-long 
bargaining 
campaign, 
LEO 
ratified a new contract with the 
University in July that included 
salary increases and improved 
health 
benefits 
and 
job 
security for nearly 1,700 non-
tenure track faculty across the 
University’s three campuses. 
Under 
the 
agreement, 
the 
minimum salary for lecturers 
in Ann Arbor saw a 47.8 percent 
increase, going from $34,500 
to $51,000 by September 2020. 
Starting salaries in Flint and 
Dearborn were both set to reach 

$41,000 by then, a 50.2 percent 
and a 44.9 percent increase 
respectively.
LEO says it is because of 
these raises the Music, Theatre 
& Dance School moved to cut 
the dance lecturers’ course 
loads. According to an email 
provided to The Daily by LEO, 
Gonzalez 
said 
in 
February 
SMTD’s 
administration 
was 
looking to shift as many courses 
taught by lecturers as possible 
to tenure-track faculty.
“Because 
of 
the 
large 
increase in LEO salaries the 
administration would like to 
move as many LEO courses 
as possible to tenure track 
faculty,” Gonzalez wrote.

At the Planned Parenthood 
Advocates 
of 
Michigan 
conference 
in 
Lansing 
on 
Tuesday, 
Michigan 
Attorney 
General Dana Nessel said even if 
the Supreme Court overrules Roe 
v. Wade, she would not prosecute 
what would then become illegal 
cases of abortion.
“I 
will 
never 
prosecute 
a woman or her doctor for 
making the difficult decision to 
terminate a pregnancy,” Nessel 
said.
LSA senior Megan Burns, 
co-president of Students for 
Choice at the University of 
Michigan, 
and 
LSA 
senior 
Annabelle Luescher, the events 
coordinator 
for 
Students 
for 
Choice, 
attended 
the 
conference on behalf of their 
organization.
“Dana was speaking a lot 
about things she had done 
in support of women and in 
support 
of 
women’s 
rights 
during her time in her new 
position as attorney general,” 
Burns said. “She kind of threw 
it in there sort of randomly. 
I think a lot of people were 
caught off guard.”

Pres. Obama 
adviser talks 
career, book 
during event

Valerie Jarrett discusses her experiences in 
the White House, the support of her mom

LIAT WEINSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter

GOVERNMENT

On Monday evening, over 
two hundred students, faculty 
and 
community 
members 
filled the Michigan Theater 
for a conversation between 
Valerie 
Jarrett, 
former 
senior adviser to President 
Barack Obama, and Broderick 
Johnson, 
a 
former 
White 
House 
Cabinet 
secretary 
for Obama. The discussion 
touched 
on 
Jarrett’s 
experiences as a single parent 
working 
in 
the 
Chicago 
mayor’s office in addition to 
her years as Obama’s adviser 
and close confidant.
The 
talk, 
co-hosted 
by 
Nicola’s 
Books 
and 
the 
Michigan Theater, was meant 
to give the community an 
inside look into the White 
House 
during 
the 
Obama 
years and promote Jarrett’s 
new memoir, “Finding My 
Voice,” which was published 
on April 2.
Johnson, who noted Jarrett 
is the longest-serving senior 
adviser to any U.S. president, 
opened 
the 
conversation 
by 
reminiscing 
on 
their 
experiences 
together 
as 
University of Michigan law 
students. Johnson mentioned 
the two became even closer 
friends working for the Obama 
campaign in 2008.

“Over the last 15 years, 
Valerie and I have become 
very, 
very 
close 
friends 
through the campaign, the 
Senate campaign and then the 
two successful campaigns for 
president,” Johnson said. 
The conversation flowed 
between 
discussion 
of 
Jarrett’s childhood in Iran, 
where she grew up on a 
hospital compound, and her 
family’s relocation to Chicago 
when she was seven years old. 
Jarrett said while her years 
in Iran lent her a greater 
appreciation for the freedom 
awarded to citizens in the 
U.S., they also made her aware 
of the importance of a cultural 
crossover and understanding.

“It gave me the sense that 
the United States is really 
an extraordinary country,” 
Jarrett said. “But the other 
thing I learned there was that 
… we can learn a great deal 
outside our shores. So it gave 
me the context for where the 
United States fits in. Coming 
back 
to 
Chicago, 
to 
my 
mother’s home and where my 
father did his residency, they 
just felt it was great because 
they were going home. To 
me, I was going to a foreign 
country.”

Nessel discusses role of 
Roe v. Wade in the state

In 2011, after the U.S. Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a Dear Colleague 
Letter to remind schools of the importance of preventing and 
addressing sexual violence under Title IX, student Title IX cases 
were transferred to the OIE office. 

 From August 2011 to August 
 2013, OIE instituted an 
 interim procedure while the 
 University worked on a more
 robust student sexual 
 misconduct policy.

In 2013, OIE’s official 
 policy was implemented, 
 utilizing the single 
 investigator model to keep 
 a trauma informed lens
 without sacrificing fairness. 

In 2016, OIE revised its 
 policy to include intimate 
 partner violence and gender 
 
 required that there be an 
 annual review of the policy. 

 In 2017, a district judge 
 dismissed a lawsuit filed on
 behalf of a former University 
 
 
student who violated the 
 University’s Student Sexual 
 Misconduct Policy but argued 
 his due process was denied. 

Currently, OIE is working to create a more permanent version of their policy.

In 2018, the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals 
appealed this ruling, and struck 
down the University of Michigan’s 
sexual assault investigation model 
because it did not include a

of this, OIE amended its process 
to include an in-person hearing 
between students involved and the 
witnesses.

Burns said, in her experience, 
she has never seen such a concrete 
commitment 
asserted 
at 
a 
conference. She said conferences 
are usually a place for speakers 
to voice their opinions to an 
understanding audience rather 
than roll out plans.
“This 
was 
a 
pretty 
unprecedented 
event,” 
Burns 
said. “It says a lot about her 
commitment 
to 
reproductive 
rights and protecting women in 
the state of Michigan.”
Kaylee Tegethoff, Michigan’s 
state captain for Students for 
Life of America, serves as the 
spokesperson for the state’s pro-
life student advocates. She believes 
Nessel’s announcement does little 
to protect Michiganders. 
In an interview with The 
Daily, Tegethoff said Nessel’s 
position on abortion prosecution 
would only serve to confuse local 
procedure across the state.
“Dana Nessel is our state’s 
chief law enforcement officer, and 
when she picks and chooses what 
laws she wants to enforce, I think 
that’s a problem,” Tegethoff said. 
“All Michigan citizens should be 
concerned about that position, 
whether you’re young or old, in 
college or out of college.”
In the event, Roe v. Wade is 
overturned federally, the legal 
issue of abortion is delegated to 
individual states.
“Michigan has a law on the 
books right now that would ban 
abortion if Roe v. Wade were 
overturned,” Tegethoff said. “I 

think whether you agree with the 
law or don’t agree with the law, 
the attorney general’s job is to 
enforce the law.”
Luescher said Nessel received 
the loudest cheers when she 
justified her decision to selectively 
enforce state laws by citing her 
predecessor’s, 
Bill 
Schuette’s, 
choice not to enforce a “single” 
environmental 
protection 
provision over the course of his 
incumbency.
“I think she knows what she’s 
saying, and she’s not saying it just 
to be inflammatory,” Burns said. 
“She’s not saying it just to make a 
stance. She’s saying it because she 
really is convicted by it and she 
wants to hold to it.”
Luescher said she sees the 
attorney general’s announcement 
as an assurance of security for 
women in Michigan that their 
rights will not spontaneously 
disappear if Roe v. Wade is 
overturned.
“There is this sense that a lot 
of people had that suddenly this 
giant turn in the tide occurred,” 
Luescher said. “Suddenly a lot of 
people are against reproductive 
justice or abortion rights and 
what the attorney general and the 
whole conference was saying was 
that ‘no, there are a lot of people 
supporting this and proactively 
working on it.’”
Burns 
believes 
Nessel’s 
announcement positions her well 
for re-election because her young 
voters 
strongly 
support 
this 
portion of her platform.
“At the University of Michigan, 
we have a large community that 
supports Students for Choice 
and 
supports 
reproductive 

rights, broadly speaking,” Burns 
said. “The younger generation 
is more politically favorable of 
these policies and Dana Nessel’s 
stances. I also would say that if 
we are the ones that are going out 
to vote in the next election, then I 
think this is a favorable thing for 
Dana to say because it speaks to 
our interest and it speaks to our 
concerns as young people.”
Tegethoff disagrees. She said 
there are more pro-life young 
adults than there have been since 
the Roe v. Wade ruling. Tegethoff 
believes these young advocates 
will eventually eliminate Roe v. 
Wade.
“Most 
people 
are 
now 
not saying ‘if Roe v. Wade is 
overturned,’” 
Tegethoff 
said. 
“It’s now ‘when Roe v. Wade is 
overturned.’ The when and how of 
that has yet to be determined, but 
we do have a pro-life majority on 
the Supreme Court, and I do think 
that in the next few years, Roe v. 
Wade is likely to be overturned.”
Tegethoff said she hopes that, 
along with a change in abortion 
law, the United States will alter 
Americans’ 
perspective 
on 
abortion in general.
“Ultimately, I also hope to see 
that hearts and minds would 
change,” Tegethoff said. “I don’t 
just want abortion to be illegal. I 
want abortion to be unthinkable. 
I want women to realize that the 
unborn is a human being that has 
value and that we should respect 
that life.”
Tegethoff said she hopes the 
law will soon align with her 
morals and ethics, strengthening 
the respect Americans have for its 
authority.

“If we all have disrespect for 
the law, just think about what 
the result is,” Tegethoff said. 
“That’s kind of scary. Pro-life or 
pro-choice, we can all agree that 
respect and adherence to the law 
is important.”
Burns worries that even if the 
law changes, it will not be adhered 
to by communities privileged 
enough to ignore it.
“This is not really a big 
concern for a lot of students at the 
University of Michigan because 
the University is filled with a 
lot of upper middle-class white 
students who will always have 
access to reproductive rights 
and health care, whether or not 
it’s criminalized,” Burns said. 
“That’s not to say that it will be 
easy moving forward if Roe is 
overturned, but it is to say that the 
people that are truly at risk here 
are 
low-income, 
marginalized 
communities.”

Luescher said Nessel’s plan 
will 
benefit 
marginalized 
communities such as people of 
color or low-income.
“Not only is (Nessel’s plan) 
going to help all women, but it’s 
going to make sure that low-
income women who are already 
burdened aren’t going to be 
burdened further by legislative 
maneuvers that are done, I think, 
quite carelessly,” Luescher said.
Luescher, Burns and Tegethoff 
all agree the state legislature will 
lead the way in how abortion law 
is implemented in Michigan.
“Whether Roe v. Wade is 
overturned in the next few years 
or further on down the road, 
that’s really just the start of the

From Page 1

In an email to The Daily, 
Gonzalez 
denied 
the 
email 
existed 
and 
said 
she was “amazed at how 
many invented facts are 

circulating.”
Gonzalez 
said 
LEO’s 
information 
was 
“not 
accurate,” referring press 
inquiries 
to 
David 
Gier, 
dean of SMTD.
Speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
Gier, University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald wrote, in an 
email interview with The 
Daily, only the dean could 

represent the SMTD.
“The 
dean 
has 
been 
absolutely clear that SMTD 
has not and will not make 
personnel decisions as a 
result of LEO’s success at the 
bargaining table,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “SMTD is, however, 
conducting 
a 
review 
of 
its 
entire 
instructional 
workforce, 
including 
all 
tenured, tenure-track and 
clinical faculty, lecturers 
and 
graduate 
student 
instructors. 
This 
review 
will include an examination 
of teaching loads and course 
enrollment.”
Fitzgerald explained this 
review was “a normal part 
of what any school and 
college on our campus does 
on a regular basis,” adding 
SMTD and the University 
would follow the process 
outlined in the LEO contract 
if any workload changes 
would impact lecturers.
According to LEO, Biza, 
a lecturer who has taught 
Congolese 
dance 
at 
the 
University for more than 
30 years, would be facing 
a two-thirds reduction in 
his course load. Both Beck 
and Biza are “long-serving” 
lecturers, 
a 
category 
defined by the 2018 contract 
as someone who has been a 
lecturer for at least 12 years.
LEO 
Vice 
President 
Kirsten Herold said despite 
Beck and Biza’s seniority, 
the union could not do 

much to fight any personnel 
decisions made by SMTD.
“We 
can’t 
tell 
the 
employer, you know, who 
teaches 
what 
classes,” 
Herold said. “If they decide 
they want to give a class 
that a lecturer has taught to 
a graduate student, they can 
do it. If they want to give 
it to a tenure-track faculty 
member, they can do it.”
At 
a 
performance 
put 
on by students in Biza’s 
class 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Music, Theatre & Dance 
on Saturday, about a dozen 
LEO members distributed 
fliers protesting the alleged 
cuts to Beck’s and Biza’s 
teaching assignments.
LSA 
senior 
Zi 
Yang 
performed at a showcase. 
She 
said 
the 
class 
was 
appreciative of Biza and his 
teaching.
“He’s been a really great 
lecturer 
and 
we 
really 
appreciated his class,” Yang 
said. “We hope that he 
can teach for as long as he 
wants to because he’s in his 
sixties, but he has so much 
energy. 
Everyone 
thinks 
he’s 40.”
Biza said SMTD had not 
informed him of reductions 
to his scheduled course 
load, but that Beck told 
him. He said that while he 
had 
not 
heard 
anything 
from the Music, Theatre & 
Dance School in regard to 
the reductions, he was still 

concerned.
“This is the only job I 
have,” Biza said. “I’m a part-
time teacher and I don’t 
get those many hours, so if 
they cut that, that means I 
have to look for some other 
job, I have to look for some 
other job or do something 
to support my family.”
Beck said she had not 
been given official word 
from SMTD. She said the 
school would have to inform 
her of its decision by April 
30 — the day her contract 
ends.
Herold 
said 
she 
was 
doubtful of claims from 
SMTD that the school had 
not yet reached a final 
decision. She said if there 
was misinformation, it was 
because SMTD “has given 
us 
different 
information 
every time we talked to 
them.”
“Basically they haven’t 
given 
us 
any 
answers 
about why it’s her and not 
less 
senior, 
less 
highly 
paid people, none of that,” 
Herold said. “They’re just 
stonewalling, 
so 
that’s 
why we’re just extremely 
frustrated at this point. I 

really think, you know, we 
were told they haven’t made 
up the real final decision 
yet. I don’t know anybody 
in the school believes that … 
They’re just trying to wait 
until students are gone and 
then to make the suddenly 
miraculously make the final 
decision to lay them off.”
Biza said he had not 
reached out to SMTD about 
the course load reduction, 
but added he did not feel 
the responsibility was on 
him to do so.
“If you have a boss, they 
will tell you what’s going 
on usually in a professional 
way — you call a meeting 
and you explain in detail 
what’s 
going 
on,” 
Biza 
said. “(Then) I can express 
myself, 
we 
can 
have 
a 
conversation … This is a 
big thing happening, so you 
can’t just send an email 
to somebody. You need to 
come sit down and give (an) 
explanation.”

(Regarding OIE’s priorities in 
investigations,) that’s a little bit 
of a difficult question because I 
would say our priority of course 
is always to address all of the 
matters, right. And as quickly 
as possible, which is difficult to 
do, especially as we’ve had really 
significant increases over the last 
couple of years and the number 
of reports that we’ve received, 
and to do them again in that 
fair and appropriate way, make 
sure that people are supported. 
We are not advocates; we’re 
neutral, so we’re not advocates 
for anyone, but making sure that 
people do have the information 
and the ability to connect with 
resources that they might need 
for support. And then at the same 
time, of course, when things 
come in, we have to assess things 
like, is there an immediate safety 
threat? What is the impact on 
our community? Is there a risk of 
ongoing and continuing harm to 
members of the community?
And so we have to look at 
that and assess those things. 
So of course, that doesn’t mean 
that sometimes things come 
in that need a more immediate 
response. We’re never wanting 
to drop anything or let anything 
fall through the cracks or drop 
off the plate in order to do that. 
But that does necessarily mean 
that if something comes in and 
it’s an urgent, recent (allegation), 
there might be an immediate 
safety issue. We need to drop 
everything we’re doing to call 
the police. We might need to 
reach out to someone and make 
sure that there are appropriately 
connected with officers at other 
places pretty quickly. There’s 
sometimes 
some 
actions 
or 
investigations that we need to 
move forward because we need 
to address potential ongoing 
issues.
Jeffery Frumkin: I think we 
spend… an appropriate amount 
of time in the initial assessment 
of the complaint that comes in. 
Oftentimes, there’s a third-party 
person who’s reporting it. And so 
we try to get in touch with the 
person that it’s about. They may 
or may not want to talk to us. 
We still have to go through the 
same kind of assessment that is, 
is there something that needs to 
be looked at further either from 
a safety standpoint or from a 
policy violation standpoint? So 
it’s not as “clean” as, “I feel that 
I have somebody has violated 
the policy against me and I’m 
filing a complaint.” Oftentimes 
a complaint comes much farther 
down in the process. But yet 
there is still work being done 
trying to get to that point.
TMD: On campus, you’re 
mainly associated with sexual 
misconduct 
investigation 
— that’s where most of the 
conversation is. What else does 
OIE do?
ES: So the only student 
cases 
that 
we 
address 
are 
the sexual and gender-based 
misconduct. But we also do 
all of the discrimination and 
discriminatory 
harassment 
complaints related to faculty 
and staff. So that would mean 
any protected class identified 
under 
the 
University’s 
nondiscrimination policy: age, 
race, color, religion, national 
origin, disability, veteran status, 
height, weight, marital status, 
all of those protected classes 
that are identified if someone 
has … all of those things … then 
those would be things that we 
would look into. And just like 
with the student sexual and 
gender-based misconduct, that 
might mean an investigation. 
Sometimes 
we 
do 
climate 
assessments 
of 
particular 
areas … if a staff member files 
a grievance through the staff 
grievance process, they could do 
that instead of filing a complaint 
with OIE, particularly if they 
have 
other 
concerns 
that 
might not relate to one of those 
protected classes. 
TMD: Can you describe the 
process once a claimant or 
complainant files a complaint 
or claim, specifically noting 
this increased use of adaptable 
resolutions?
The Daily created a flow 
chart 
summarizing 
Seney’s 
explanation of OIE’s process.
[insert flow chart]
JF: And how many of these 
have we actually been able to do?
ES: One of them has been 
completed so far.
JF: So it’s that longer process 
as well at the court order last 
October.

ES: Well, right. It wouldn’t 
generally take that one, but of 
course, because we had cases 
that were open at the time that 
we’ve had to revise the policy 
and the court had ordered us to 
change the policy including for 
those cases.
JF: We had to ramp up for 
the new policy. Fortunately or 
unfortunately, cases that were in 
queue just had to be put on hold 
until the new policy was up and 
running.
TMD: 
How 
are 
OIE 
investigators trained? What is 
that process like?
ES: … One of the first things 
is to spend some time looking 
at case files and reading reports 
and going through how an 
investigation happens, reading 
what the analysis is and why, 
going to talk to the investigator 
to talk about any questions, or 
what about this piece of it, or 
they might agree or disagree 
or whatever it might be. At 
the same time that they’re 
doing 
that 
to 
familiarize 
themselves with that in a real 
case kind of way. They also will 
shadow 
other 
investigators. 
So if parties or witnesses are 
comfortable, they would sit in 
on interviews, they might help 
in preparing those statements 
and have someone else, the more 
experienced investigator look 
over the statement. They would 
work closely with investigators 
that are already in the office 
and the assistant and associate 
directors and senior director to 
walk through cases.
… Then amidst all of this 
we have materials that are 
a combination of University 
policies, some documents that 
we’ve put together outlining 
what 
the 
standards 
and 
principles 
are 
behind 
these 
investigations 
and 
these 
processes, 
and 
things 
like 
government guidance and all 
of that. So people are getting 
a well-rounded expertise in 
the legal framework, in the 
things that have come from 
our particular policies and also 
our 
institutional 
values. 
So 
this might not be written into a 
policy, but an institutional value, 
obviously, is we want to treat 
people with respect. We want 
people to feel comfortable when 
they’re coming in to meet with 
us and to feel like they’re being 
heard and to be heard. So we 
want to do those things.
… And then there’s lots of 
external sources that we use 
for training too when someone 
starts out, but also on an ongoing 
basis. So things like webinars, 
attending 
conferences, 
attending 
trainings. 
We 
might have someone come in 
sometimes 
to 
provide 
some 
education and some training 
or continuing education on an 
area of particular expertise. For 
example, we had someone come 
in related to intimate partner 
violence when that became part 
of the scope of the policy. So 
that’s a lot of what it looks like 
at the beginning, but then that 
continues as well.
TMD: Throughout this, is 
there any kind of sensitivity 
training?
ES: There is — I would say 
that’s 
woven 
throughout 
it. 
So that’s definitely part of 
the written materials. That’s 
definitely a strong part of the 
conversation that when you’re 
sitting in, when an investigator 
is sitting in and when they are 
taking the lead that the other 
staff would be talking about the 
more experienced investigators, 
the assistant director, associate 
director would be talking about 
those things … So there’s not a 
point where we sit down and say, 
okay, now for 90 minutes we’re 
going to talk about things to say 
and things not to say.
… And typically, I mean, 
when we’re hiring someone, 
they generally — we hope and, 
and this has been the case, 
thankfully — want to do this 
work because they already know 
why it’s important and they 
think it’s important for it to be 
done well. But that’s still not 
something that we would just 
assume that everyone knows 
or is experienced with. This is 
a different, again, people have 
come from different educational 
and 
different 
professional 
experience backgrounds. … But 
that’s definitely something that 
we talk about at the very outset.
… This is not my original 
thought, so I’ll, I’ll credit it to 
our last, our most recent senior 
director of Pam Heatlie. She’s 
said this more articulately than 
I probably will. But this really, I 

feel like resonates with probably 
everyone in the office, is that 
you can do this work. And as I 
said, it’s compliancy … and you 
can do this work in a way that’s 
compliant but not done well. 
And it’s really important to us 
to not just check the compliance 
boxes, but to actually do it well. 
So I think that’s actually one of 
the very initial conversations 
about how all of the interactions 
need to go.
JF: The interview process 
itself involves a small public 
presentation. So we get an 
opportunity to see how the 
individual is interacting outside 
of the search committee setting. 
In some cases, it has been very 
determinative one way or the 
other as to whether or not we 
think the person can do more 
than just what are the facts. 
Because you are dealing with 
human beings, and at various 
levels 
in 
the 
continuum. 
Students or faculty and staff 
depending on what the case is, 
who have a problem, and they 
want somebody to help them 
with the problem. And we’re 
also dealing with people who 
are maybe scratching their head 
as to why they’re being called 
in there. Plus the witnesses in 
between. So yeah, it’s important.
TMD: How do you handle 
situations 
of 
investigators 
mishandling cases?
ES: So mishandling cases 
could mean any number of 
things. So, if a concern is 
brought to our attention, and 
certainly it’s the case that these 
are not pleasant things. So no 
one is going to be like, “Oh, that 
was a great time. I’m super glad 
that I got the opportunity to go 
through that process.” No one 
on any side of it feels that way, 
no matter what. It can be done 
the best it possibly can and it’s 
still not going to be pleasant. 
Having said that, of course we 
want to do the best we can to 
mitigate the extent to which it is 
additionally unpleasant, beyond 
it’s 
an 
inherently 
stressful 
situation. So all of that is to say 
that it is not uncommon that 
someone might have a concern 
or feel sort of unhappy and that 
might be general or it might 
be about one specific aspect. 
For example, if they felt like 
someone said something to them 
that was offensive or they didn’t 
feel respected in an interaction. 
That is definitely feedback that 
we welcome and want.
I think it’s really important 
for us to have the opportunity 
to make something right if we 
have made a mistake, and to 
learn from, if it’s something 
that’s applicable. I think people 
have different preferences about 
different things and there will 
be some things that might feel 
bad or someone might think 
is inappropriate and someone 
else might actually find that to 
be supportive and helpful and 
vice versa. And having said 
that, I appreciate if we can get 
that feedback so that we can 
know about it and address it. 
So when those concerns are 
brought to our attention, we 
look pretty carefully at what 
has happened… If we find that 
we have made a mistake in some 
way, I think it’s hard to answer 
to that sort of globally what 
we would do, because I think 
it depends on the mistake. So 
if we’ve made a mistake that’s 
impacted a case, that would 
certainly be something that we 
would need to remedy in a pretty 
tangible way. If it’s more about 
something that has happened 
where an interaction wasn’t as 
comfortable for someone as it 
could have been, then I think we 
would want to address that, but it 
would also depend on what they 
would want. Would they like 
to have a chance to talk to the 
investigator about it and express 
how they felt about it? Would 
they like to just have a different 
investigator? Where are we in 
the process? So it really depends 
on the specific circumstances, 
but I would say I think it’s really 
important.
JF: I think I’ve had, since 
I 
started 
back 
in 
October, 
probably four, maybe five, either 
complainants or respondents, 
a request to come talk to me 
about some aspect of the of the 
process. Each one has its own 
circumstances, but they kind of 
fall into two categories. One is 
procedurally, the investigator 
made a mistake. And then the 
other one is they don’t like 
the 
outcome. 
Procedurally, 
if an investigator has made a 
mistake, the investigator and I 
will talk about that before the 

individual comes in. I have an 
operational 
standard, 
which 
is the truth is as bad as it gets. 
If we made a mistake, we’re 
going to own up to it and we’re 
going to admit it. If it’s had, 
as Elizabeth said, a material 
impact on the case, we’ll go back 
and try and correct that and its 
implications as much as possible. 
And I apologize. Sometimes that 
is all that is necessary. Other 
times people decide they want 
to complain to others in the 
University, that’s fine. We have 
those conversations face to face. 
And usually the investigator is 
in the conference with me. The 
other one, the other category 
is when they say, well, you just 
got it wrong. There’s not much 
we can do about that other 
than to listen. We’re not going 
to re-litigate, to use that term, 
unless there’s some new material 
piece of evidence or information. 
And of course we will take that 
and look at it. If somebody has 
come in to complain that they 
have been sexually harassed 
or discriminated in some way 
and they’re told that whatever 
happened, it didn’t rise to the 
level of violating our policy, they 
don’t like to hear that.
But that’s a responsibility that 
we have is that, is to be clear that 
if everything the individual has 
said to us is absolutely true, and 
yet in our judgment, and there’s 
… two or three different levels 
of review on this. If everything 
the person said is true and yet 
it still doesn’t rise to the level 
of whatever the standard is in 
the policy, then we’re not going 
to say that the policy’s been 
violated. That doesn’t mean that 
what happened to the individual 
didn’t happen. Those are tough 
conversations to have and we 
recognize that.
TMD: In general, so not 
counting when you had to leave 
cases open while you revised the 
policy, what is the ideal timeline 
of an investigation?
ES: So we have timeframes 
laid out in the policy right now 
on a student sexual misconduct 
policy for whole, start to finish an 
investigation, any sanctions, any 
appeals, et cetera. I think that 
whole process is 120 days. What 
we used to have in the policy has 
been 60. At one point it was 45, 
which was based on guidance 
from the federal government 
that they felt that schools should 
be able to investigate cases, 
sanction if there’s a finding of a 
violation and hear any appeals in 
60 days.
In most cases, 60 days is not 
realistic. And so we have had 
that in our policy. We would be 
transparent with people up front 
that that is absolutely what we’re 
striving for. It very well may 
not be the case. So now we’ve, 
we’ve changed those timelines 
to reflect that we haven’t taken 
anything out of the process and 
we have given people longer 
to review (the) preliminary 
report and evidence file and we 
have this whole extra step of a 
hearing. And so it’s necessarily, 
it’s going to take longer. And this 
is one of the things about the 
hearing model. That is what it 
is. We try not to have to go to a 
hearing model as an institution, 
and have a ruling that we have to. 
So it is longer than that typically. 
And I would say we still have 
that conversation at the outset 
of speaking to people. It’s really 
hard and this is, it’s frustrating 
for us. I’m 100 percent sure that 
it’s much more frustrating for 
the people who are participating 
in this not as their job like it is 
for us, but because it’s stressful 
for them, they’re in it, they’re 
in the middle of it, it’s their life 
and they’re trying to balance all 
of the other things going on in 
their life at the same time with 
this hanging over their head, 
whatever their role in it is.
… But we’re still working on 
getting caught up in terms of 
staffing resources to make sure 
that we can handle the case load 
that we have. And you know, 
certainly with #MeToo, with 
Larry Nassar, I think it’s probably 
safe to say that’s contributed 
to an increase in case load. So 
that’s great. We don’t want to 
ever say we have too many cases 
right now, so we’ll call you back 
in three months and then maybe 
you can report then. We’ll take 
all of the cases. But then that 
does mean that they might all 
take a little bit longer. And then 
in any given case, there might 
be 
requests 
for 
extensions 
or law enforcement holds or 
unavailability of a witness who 
has super critical information or 
whatever it might be.

So that’s a long answer to a 
short question. The short answer 
is we’re always driving for 120 
days. It’s often going to be longer 
than that. We just try to do our 
best to stay within it and be 
transparent with people about it.
TMD: How frequently do 
you keep the complainants and 
respondents updated?
ES: So this is part of, I think 
something that’s great about 
having the OSCR case manager, 
is I think that we will able be able 
to really improve and make that 
better. So we’ve always tried to 
do that sort of regular intervals. 
If we said we’re striving for 60 
days and it’s getting to be 60 
days, then we are going to want 
to check in.
There’s 
regular 
check-ins 
throughout the process anyway. 
At a minimum because of the 
process. So I’m sending you your 
statement, I’m sending you the 
preliminary report, whatever 
it might be. We also check in 
at points like, “Spring Break is 
coming up, if I have something 
for you, are you going to be 
available? Just want to let you 
know where the case is going,” 
all of those things. So we try 
to do that pretty regularly and 
we also encourage people, they 
should feel free to reach out to us, 
too, even though we’re trying to 
proactively keep them involved. 

And having said that, there are 
times when you’re investigating 
a case where there might be 
a long period of time where 
you’re talking to witnesses and 
you’re working on it every day … 
I know I’m working on it every 
day cause here I am doing it. I’m 
thinking about this case all day, 
every day and the parties might 
be thinking, why haven’t heard 
from her in two weeks, what’s 
going on? So we try to stay on top 
of that… We do try to encourage 
people if they want updates to 
check in, but we also, the OSCR 
case manager will be doing quite 
a bit of that now, which I think 
might be helpful. 
For 
parties’ 
comfort, 
in 
reaching out to the case manager 
that’s a little bit more removed 
from the actual investigation 
process, and that also might 
create a little more space for 
some more regular check ins.
Anyone who’s moving right 
through 
an 
investigative 
resolution 
or 
an 
adaptable 
resolution, 
they 
have 
this 
primary point of contact where 
they can say, “I need an interim 
measure, I need an academic 
accommodation. Where is my 
investigation? I have questions 
about this process.”

O

n April 9, in response to 
demands 
from 
climate 
activists for the University 
of Michigan to divest from fossil 
fuels, University President Mark 
Schlissel gave his interpretation of 
the University’s divestment policy 
at a carbon neutrality public session: 
“Essentially, we don’t divest … If 
we begin the process of narrowing 
what the endowment can invest in, 
based on very valid arguments and 
concerns from sincere people, the 
ability to invest shrinks, the value of 
the endowment goes down and the 
institution suffers. We’re just not 
going to divest.”
Though I will not talk about the 
merits of divesting from fossil fuels 
specifically, the recent talking point 
from our president opens the door 
for a larger discussion about the 
University’s endowment divestment 
policy and the student body’s role 
in endowment investments. But 
first, it is important to consider why 
students care about divestment, 
since our commitment to divestment 
is so quickly brushed aside by the 
administration.
As students, we are drawn to 
divestment 
discussions 
because 
they offer an avenue where we can 
tangibly express our beliefs on issues 
over which we have little control. In 
a prestigious, high-minded academic 
institution, there is a disconnect 
between the issues we think about 
and the amount of control we have 
over them. In our classes, readings 
and conversations with peers, we 
are discussing the most pressing 
and salient global issues, yet we have 
little agency over them. The issues 
we do have influence over — campus 
and Ann Arbor policies — are not 
stressed in our academic settings, 
and consequently (amazing campus 
organizing aside) these policies do 
not receive the student attention they 
deserve.
When activists are spoken 
down to, we are told we should 
express ourselves by voting. We 
do that, but if the issues our votes 
have real influence over (municipal 
and statewide elections) are so 
important, why are we not learning 
about them in the classroom? We 
are told we are learning about global 
issues to become global leaders, but 
we do not feel we have the power 
to enact change on that scale. The 
University’s 
endowment, 
which 
totals approximately $12 billion, 
is among the only significant, 
tangible thing we can immediately 
and forcefully express our values 
and beliefs on issues that we have 

minimal influence over. And this —
Schlissel has stated — is off limits.
We are also drawn to divestment 
because if we want to change the 
world, we have a responsibility to 
shape our institutions in accordance 
with our values. The right kind of 
changes are not going to come from 
top-down policy mandates, but from 
people taking ownership of our 
campus issues. 
The University does not want 
to talk about divestment because it 
opens up uneasy and controversial 
political discussions that could 
alienate 
donors, 
faculty 
and 
potential students. Furthermore, 
the University wants its financial 
safety to be cushioned in case of an 
emergency so that it can continue 
to function at full capacity. These 
are both worthwhile concerns, but 
this mindset ignores the tangible 
harm our investments cause as well 
as how they reflect on our values as 
an institution. Like many students, 
I want the University to change its 
divestment policies, or at least clarify 
them.
In his response at the town hall 
carbon neutrality public session, 
Schlissel accurately depicted current 
University policy: The issue is that 
the policy is unclear. The University 
tries to shield its endowment from 
political issues, but it acknowledges 
that exceptions are sometimes 
necessary. If an issue is labeled 
an 
exception, 
the 
University’s 
Board of Regents creates an ad hoc 
committee to look closely at the issue 
in question and decide whether to 
recommend divestment. The only 
two issues granted divestment were 
South African apartheid in 1978 
and the tobacco industry in 1999. 
In 2005, the University spelled out 
the three criteria that need to be 
met to achieve such a status: 1) “The 
concern to be explored must express 
the broadly and consistently held 
position of the campus community 
over time;” 2) “There must be reason 
to believe that the behavior or action 
in question may be antithetical to 
the core mission and values of the 
University;” 3) “There must be reason 
to believe that the organization, 
industry or entity to be singled out 
may be uniquely responsible for the 
problems identified.”
If the University is trying to 
construct a rational divestment 
policy, criteria one and three require 
revisions, or at least, clarifications.
The first criterion is flawed 
because there is no threshold for 
evaluating the campus position. The 
campus community will never reach 

a uniform opinion. Consequently, the 
University can pretend there is no 
campus-wide consensus if it does not 
want to discuss divestment, as there 
are no tangible points that determine 
whether the campus community 
supports divestment. The University 
should establish specific procedures 
and benchmarks for determining 
if 
particular 
divestment 
issues 
have broad and consistent campus 
support.
The 
third 
criterion 
needs 
changing because it requires that 
the companies being divested from 
are uniquely responsible for the issue 
being objected to. This criterion 
should be broadened to include those 
companies that bear responsibility 
in all levels, not just “unique 
responsibility” as the policy states.
Lastly, if the University wants 
to abide by these criteria for 
divestment, it should be proactive in 
evaluating whether its endowment 
is 
supporting 
companies 
the 
campus community objects to. The 
University should not have to wait 
to be pushed by campus activists 
— it should seek to reflect campus 
values in the endowment. One way 
to do that would be to publicize the 
endowment portfolios, allowing the 
community to offer input.
Perhaps 
these 
criteria 
are intentionally vague so the 
administration can make divestment 
decisions unilaterally. If that is the 
objective, they should not pretend 
that there is any logic to the decision 
of whether to discuss divestment 
and admit that it is just political 
positioning. If the criteria are just 
a facade for unilateral decision-
making, the University should scrap 
the criteria entirely.
The University cannot have 
it both ways. If the policy is truly 
that the endowment will never be 
impacted by political issues, then 
it should eliminate the criteria for 
divestment procedure. It has not 
done this because there are obviously 
issues our endowment should not be 
financially supporting and because 
the way we spend our money 
reflects our values. If the University 
acknowledges that some divestment 
claims are valid, it should engage 
in these conversations honestly. 
Divestment 
conversations 
are 
always going to be messy, but 
the University should welcome 
students taking ownership over 
the institutions we care about.

In response, the Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board pushed for 
more transparency on the policy, 
how it works and its impacts 
on specific communities. As 
the semester has progressed, 
we are becoming increasingly 
apprehensive of the University’s 
felony 
disclosure 
policy, 
especially 
considering 
the 
University’s purported goals to 
promote inclusion on campus. 
The initiatives and projects 
set out in the Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion plan are meant to 
be deeply intertwined with 
the 
University’s 
mission 
of 
providing an excellent public 
education for the public good. 
It is, consequently, an ambitious 
undertaking, 
encompassing 
49 plans developed by school, 
college 
and 
campus 
units. 
Any provision made by the 
plan is considered to be not 
only an aspect of the DEI plan 
itself, but as essential to the 
University’s goal of creating a 
more welcoming campus where 
all students have an opportunity 
to thrive. Indeed, the DEI plan 
is 
consistently 
championed 
as a concrete example of the 
University’s genuine interest in 
promoting an inclusive campus. 
In the 2018 Strategic Plan 
Progress 
Report, 
University 
President Mark Schlissel writes, 
“Our Strategic Plan remains a 
pledge that will guide our focus 
as we work to live up to our most 
cherished ideals.”
While 
we 
applaud 
the 
DEI plan in its mission, we 
also 
find 
that 
University 
support of policies such as the 
felony disclosure policy call 
these “cherished ideals” into 
question. The felony disclosure 
policy requires employees to 
disclose any felony charges and 
convictions after Feb. 1, 2019, 
within a week of the charge or 
conviction, and was created 
for the purpose of maintaining 
campus safety. However, in 
the wake of its announcement, 
many groups have found fault in 
the plan’s lack of transparency, 
potential violation of due process 
and contradiction with DEI. We 
as an Editorial Board believe 
this policy is underdeveloped 
and misinformed, and its impact 
becomes the reverse of its 
intention: It hurts and isolates 
communities at our university.
The 
felony 
disclosure 
policy 
undermines 
the 
University’s DEI initiative by 
ignoring 
how 
the 
criminal 
justice 
system 
in 
Michigan 
disproportionately 
affects 
people of color. In Michigan 
alone, for example, Black people 
are overrepresented in prisons, 
accounting for 49 percent of 
the 
incarcerated 
population, 
but only 14 percent of the state 
population. 
This 
picture 
of 
over-criminalization 
is 
true 
nationwide 
as 
well, 
where 
people of color are more likely 
than their white counterparts 
to enter the criminal justice 
system. One of the main drivers 
of this disparity in the racial 
makeup of prisons is racial bias, 
and therefore is necessarily 
a concern for advocates of 
diversity, equity and inclusion.

The fear POC communities 
feel in regard to the felony 
disclosure policy is a detrimental 
effect of the policy and indicative 
of its contradictory nature. The 
obvious 
disparities 
between 
white and POC groups in regard 
to their experiences with the 
criminal justice system has even 
proven itself on our campus in 
recent years. During the 2017 
home football game between 
Michigan and Michigan State, 
Black and Latino fraternities 
reported 
receiving 
several 
citations and arrests, coupled 
with aggressive tactics from the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, 
while 
the 
predominantly 
white Interfraternity Council 
fraternities reported no police 
presence or citations. This, along 
with other campus events, added 
to existing mistrust between 
police and POC, and a call for 
greater communication between 
police and POC organizations. 
The felony disclosure policy, 
while impacting all University 
students and faculty, has a 
disproportionate 
effect 
on 
minority groups who already 
face 
adverse 
policing 
and 
treatment 
in 
the 
criminal 
justice system. The implications 
of this are both tangible and 
social, from actually preventing 
minorities from being employed 
at the University to creating a 
campus atmosphere that pegs 
POC members as “other.” If the 
felony disclosure policy is meant 
to promote a feeling of safety, 
it fails in its attack on these 
marginalized communities.
While legislation such as 
ban-the-box laws attempts to 
combat racial discrimination, 
the felony disclosure policy 
does 
the 
opposite, 
actively 
contradicting DEI. In September 
2018, Gov. Rick Snyder signed 
a ban-the-box law to remove 
the question, “Have you been 
convicted of a felony?” from 
state job applications. In doing 
so, a huge barrier to employment 
and 
societal 
inclusion 
was 
lifted for those entangled in 
the criminal justice system. 
With 
the 
felony 
disclosure 
policy, the University is moving 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
making it harder for groups 
disproportionately targeted by 
over-criminalization to obtain 
employment.
The 
University 
cannot 
justifiably 
say 
it 
supports 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
while simultaneously promoting 
discriminatory 
policies 
such 
as felony disclosure. Since the 
University has already heard 
strong critique from voices on 
this campus — including the 
ACLU, the Carceral State Project 
and numerous professors and 
alumni — continuing to uphold 
the policy represents strategic 
ignorance. This is the same 
type of strategic ignorance that 
haunts debates of University 
inaction on issues like carbon 
neutrality, potentially emerging 
as a harmful pattern of behavior 
where 
the 
ideals 
that 
the 
University holds up to the 
community are diametrically 
opposed 
to 
the 
policies 
it 
actually supports.

While the felony disclosure 
policy’s 
presumed 
goal 
is 
to make our campus safer, 
especially 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
tumultuous events such as the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance sexual assault allegations 
and the false shooter alarm, it 
lacks the structure and logic to 
actually carry out this mission. 
The policy should theoretically 
filter out University students or 
employees that could be a threat 
to campus or student safety. But 
the policy is fulfilled by entering 
information into a simple online 
form, followed by a subsequent 
review 
process 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
University’s 
Human 
Resources department, making 
it a subjective and unclear 
process that gives employees 
little clarity about how their 
information will be evaluated.
Heather Ann Thompson, a 
professor in the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies, affirms this idea that 
the policy actually holds no 
true impact: “The irony here 
is that these policies cause 
harm and do not make the 
public safe,” Thompson said. 
“Frankly, some of the evidence 
says 
when 
you 
criminalize 
people and you make them 
feel fearful of reporting, then 
in fact you increase danger.” 
The halfhearted effort of this 
policy does not ensure student 
safety as it lacks an objective, 
structured procedure, and could 
actually have adverse effects.
Additionally, in the wake of 
the sexual assault allegations, 
it is clear that the University 
could have better focused its 
attention on creating helpful 
policies 
or 
programs 
for 
survivors of sexual misconduct 
on campus, rather than the 
overarching felony disclosure 
policy. Survivors not only have 
to deal with the emotional and 
physical trauma following their 
assault, but also an intricate 
and often unpromising legal 
process in order to get justice or 
to finally feel safe on campus. 
In the fall, the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals required that 
universities allow for cross-
examinations of the accuser in 
sexual misconduct cases. This 
has caused deep concern in the 
community, as the process of 
cross-examination, often times 
carried out by the accused, 
can unnecessarily distress the 
survivor. We believe that the 
University should direct its 
resources and energy toward 
protecting these survivors, by 
implementing a thorough policy 
that has clear and direct impact. 
Not all felonies are sexual 
assault 
charges, 
of 
course, 
and the policy is not explicitly 
meant to address those findings. 
But we do believe that uplifting 
and supporting sexual assault 
survivors is a huge part of 
promoting campus safety and 
is 
especially 
relevant 
now. 
The felony disclosure policy 
does little to help this group of 
students feel safe.

I

t’s no surprise that the 
economy is booming. For 
more than 10 years, the 
market has been on a tear, and 
after overcoming the threat of 
recession in 2018, it does seem 
like we have a couple of years 
before the market takes its next 
major downturn. In fact, the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average 
has already rallied to recover 
nearly all of its losses it incurred 
over last year’s turbulent slump. 
Accordingly, the March jobs 
report that recently showed 
the addition of of 196,000 jobs 
nationally 
is 
not 
especially 
shocking. The stats show an 
unemployment rate of a fiery 3.8 
percent, about 1 percent lower 
than the commonly accepted 
threshold for full employment 
(4.1-4.7 percent). But amid all 
of this positive data, should 
we still be concerned of the 
impending crash that everyone 
seems so anxious about? In 
short, yes and no. Yes, there will 
be an economic downturn in the 
near future, but no, there’s no 
indicator that it will necessarily 
be close to a full-on recession.
One 
potential 
area 
for 
concern in this regard is the 
aging nature of the tax cuts. The 
Trump-backed 
measure 
that 
reformed taxes and managed 
to widely revitalize the market 
is now about a year and half old 
and many expect its benefits 
will continue to fade. Without 
that driver, the economy will 
be suddenly exposed to the 
elements once again, potentially 
creating a catalyst for a recession 
in the future. However, this can 
be combated with good policies 
from the Federal Reserve, which 
has recently done a fairly good 
job in managing inflation. Their 
decision to stop the planned rate 
hikes in 2019 was a smart one, 
having allowed the economy to 

escape the chokehold the fists of 
recession almost dragged it into.
Perhaps a more dire forecast, 
however, is the one offered 
by the bond yield curve. The 
March jobs report came on 
the heels of the first inversion 
of the bond yield curve since 
2007. While such news means 
next to nothing to the average 
person, it was enough to send 
the financial world into panic, 
with the Dow Jones dropping 
nearly 500 points in response. 
The bond yield curve is simply a 
graph representing the balance 
in yield between long-term and 
short-term Treasury bonds. The 
classic ratios include the 10-year 
to the three-month and the 
10-year to the two-year. While 
the latter remained in the green 
— albeit barely — the former 
dipped under zero, indicating 
that long-term bonds had less 
yield than short-term bonds. 
In short, the market has higher 
expectations 
for 
economic 
expansion today than it does for 
the future.
Conditions 
like 
this 
are 
especially 
conducive 
to 
recession. In fact, all of the past 
nine recessions since 1955 have 
been prefaced by a yield curve 
inversion within two years prior 
to the recession. And the one 
time the yield curve inverted 
without an ensuing recession, 
the economy hit a downturn 
nonetheless. While the history 
may not directly correspond to 
the situation of the economy 
today, this precedent is still 
cause for concern.
But this doesn’t mean you 
should run to the banks right 
now and liquidate all your assets. 
Most don’t expect a coming 
recession until 2021 — late 2020 
at the earliest. Furthermore, 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund “(predicts) a rebound later 

this year and slightly stronger 
growth next year for the world 
economy.” A lot of this can be 
further delayed given that the 
U.S.-China trade talks continue 
to make progress and will come 
to a final agreement. In fact, 
according to Scott Minerd, the 
global chief investment officer of 
Guggenheim Investments, “The 
economy could grow more than 
2 percent this year. I think that’s 
going to be the big surprise.”
Another indicator to watch 
is 
the 
unemployment 
rate. 
Similar to the yield curve, the 
unemployment rate is also a 
potent indicator of recession. 
Historically, 
whenever 
the 
unemployment 
rate 
falls 
below 4 percent, a recession 
occurs in the near future. 
While the converse of the 
statement is not equivalently 
true, the recent jobs report 
did indicate an unemployment 
rate of 3.8 percent, keeping 
the labor market below the 
aforementioned 
threshold. 
Could it be that the same thing 
investors are rejoicing about 
with the jobs report will end up 
being the deciding factor in the 
upcoming economic downturn?
All that said, there is much 
to be optimistic about the 
economy at the moment. The 
recent figures show the effects 
of over a decade of expansion, 
and the economy is rejoicing 
in its success. There’s even the 
strong possibility that there 
won’t be a major recession at 
all at the culmination of this 
business cycle. The growth 
can just as well end in a minor 
downturn before the economy 
starts back again. But I guess 
we’ll have to wait until 2021 to 
actually find out.

The looming economic downturn might not be as bad as you think

Our university’s hypocrisy on crime, safety and inclusion
O

n Feb. 1, the University of Michigan made effective a new policy 
requiring faculty, staff, student employees, volunteers and visiting 
scholars to disclose if they are charged with or convicted of a felony. 
Immediately, there was strong criticism across campus, drawing complaints 
of the potential impact this will have on members of the University 
community. Moreover, upon review, the policy is vague and unclear.

I stopped watching football 
last year. Even before Kap 
took a knee, the NFL had been 
driven by a certain noxious 
brand of culture warring: 
the massive penalty flags, a 
collective shoulder shrug at 
domestic violence. The “clean 
hits” didn’t feel especially 
clean. The tackles seemed to 
be getting louder. Or maybe 
it was just me. The sad thing 
about sports is 
that 
they 
can 
be 
fun 
until 
you think about 
them too hard, 
and once you do, 
you can’t escape 
the ugliness. For 
every player I 
loved to watch 
— OBJ and that 
preposterous 
one-handed 
catch, 
the 
speedy, 
elusive 
Russell 
Wilson 
— I was haunted 
by 
an 
Aaron 
Hernandez. Or a 
Junior Seau.
“Seau,” 
a 
new “30 for 30” 
documentary 
from 
ESPN, 
follows 
the 
tragic 
undoing 
of the charismatic linebacker, 
whose suicide in 2012 ignited 
a 
long-overdue 
national 
conversation 
about 
the 
likelihood of football players 
to suffer chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy 
(CTE), 
a 
degenerative brain disease. 
Drafted by his hometown San 
Diego Chargers in 1990, Seau 
played nearly 20 years in the 
NFL, making two Super Bowl 
appearances and earning 10 
All-Pro selections. His death 
came as a shock not only 
because of his stature in the 
league, but also because of his 
cheery demeanor. “Buddy!” 
his friends and teammates 

remember 
him 
greeting 
everyone he met.
But as each NFL season 
passed, director Kirby Bradley 
illustrates, 
the 
damage 
football 
was 
inflicting 
on 
Seau grew more conspicuous. 
He announced a short-lived 
retirement 
from 
football 
through 
what 
his 
agent 
remembers 
as 
a 
bizarre, 
incoherent 
public 
speech 
in San Diego. He went on 
to play a final season with 
the Patriots, but it ended in 
heartbreak with a loss at Super 

Bowl XLII. Seau had been 
happily married and a doting 
father but began to withdraw 
from family life and turned to 
gambling. After retiring, he 
divorced his wife and spent 
less time with his children. 
Everyone 
who 
knew 
him 
was baffled by the dramatic 
change 
in 
his 
mood 
and 
personality. When a neighbor, 
an MLS soccer player who had 
suffered a concussion, told 
Seau about his symptoms, the 
linebacker scoffed: “I’ve had a 
headache since I was 15.”
For years, the NFL’s token 
response was that playing 
football 
was 
unrelated 
to 

degenerative brain disease. 
“Seau” is a damning look at 
the lengths the NFL went to to 
ensure that Seau’s death didn’t 
become a real problem for the 
league. Despite decades of 
research on the lasting health 
effects of a football career, it 
was only very recently that the 
NFL even acknowledged the 
possibility of a link to CTE. 
And though they’ve made 
various rule changes, the fact 
remains that the tackle, the 
animating force of football, is 
what makes it so dangerous. 
Junior Seau’s fight 
won’t be won so 
easily.
The NFL Draft 
is 
this 
week. 
Roger Goodell will 
saunter on and off 
a stage in Nashville 
to announce the 
picks, 
everyone 
there 
will 
boo 
him and when the 
weekend 
ends, 
there will be 254 
rookies 
in 
the 
league. 
Some 
of 
them 
won’t 
get 
much playing time 
in 
their 
careers, 
but some of them 
will. A few will 
be 
linebackers, 
like Seau, and in 
a lifetime of play, 
they’ll endure sub-
concussive 
blow 
after blow to the head. Over 
time, clumps of tau protein 
will build up in their brains 
until they strangle nerve cells. 
The research says CTE can 
make a 40-year-old man’s 
brain look like an 80-year-
old’s. Years after these players 
retire, they’ll find themselves 
becoming 
angrier, 
more 
depressed, 
more 
confused, 
more forgetful. And cowards 
like Goodell and Jerry Jones, 
who spent years peddling 
doubts about the link between 
this vicious sport and lasting 
trauma to the brain, will be 
laughing their way to the 
bank.

TV REVIEW

30 for 30

One unexpected effect of live 
theater is that it makes writing 
accountable to speech, in a way 
reading 
fiction 
aloud 
doesn’t. 
Watching 
people 
interact 
as 
characters means that a theater 
writer has to recreate human 
interaction to some extent, and in 
a lot of plays the first thing to “get 
past” is the total non-resemblance 
of the script to real speech. In what 
world do people always say exactly 
what they mean, or at least the 
exact right thing for a set of clearly 
devised situations? Plays make 
the inner workings of fiction — 
plot, “characterization,” narrative 
structure — visible (and audible) for 
the viewer.
Of course, there’s a 
very good reason why 
most playwrights don’t 
try to replicate speech. 
Speech 
is 
frequently 
illogical and often bizarre, 
carrying with it highly 
detailed shorthands that 
demonstrate 
people’s 
relationships to each other. 
If people are unsure of their 
relationship to each other, 
verbal 
communication 
frequently doesn’t work at 
all. The 2018 play “Wheelchair” by 
Will Arbery demonstrates this in 
its style, which saturates the page 
with tics, half-sentences and whole 
conversational threads that don’t go 
anywhere. It can be frustrating to 
read.

Pause.

DEVON

What
Pause.

GORDON

What was crazy about your day?

This is a completely contentless 
conversation that continues in this 
fashion for pages and pages, but 
try reading it out loud! It’s not only 
recognizable as speech, it captures 
a subtle and rather common 
feeling of being stuck in a weirdly 
transactional situation, trying to 
bridge a gap between people who 
are unsure of their relationship to 
each other.
Gordon, a Jewish man in his 
sixties, is giving away all his 
furniture to Devon, a 19-year-
old Black man, for free. We find 
out later that this is in advance of 
Gordon’s eviction from the building 
in West Williamsburg, which is 
being redone as “artist studios.” 
Gordon first has a strangely 

intimate interaction with Devon 
and later with his niece Sascha, who 
is evicting him.
The nervous impersonality of 
the overall tone is coupled with the 
instability of the whole scene. The 
stage directions at the beginning 
of the play indicate that the action 
should be underscored both with 
the sound of construction and a low 
hum which is “enough to get in our 
brains.” There’s a Beckett-esque 
sense that the theater the play is 
staged in is some kind of limit: at 
one point Gordon says, cryptically, 
“Going out there — I will dissolve.”
The characters seem either 
anxious to leave or to be left alone, 
and they sometimes seem to not be 
directly addressing each other. This 
makes it that much more jarring 
when characters declare their love 
for each other, apologize for long-
standing hurts and speculate about 
religious concerns and the nature 
of correct action. Additionally, two 
vaguely-related 
monologue-rants 
that Devon and Sascha embark on 
completely shred the discursive 
fabric of the play. They read like 
emotional vomit, like a torrent of 
thoughts that burst some kind of 
dam.
“What am I doing? I hate talking. 
Everyone always cuts me off mid-
sentence or replies with ‘Oh.’ or 
‘Yeah.’ and I hate it, damn it. I’m 
scared to go outside. I’m scared all 
the angry old people can’t see how 
free I am … I can’t even do drugs, 
and can’t do anything right.”

To this Gordon replies “That 
feels like an error. What you did 
just felt like an error.” In a way, 
the overcorrection for the nervous 
tics of everyday life constituting 
its own kind of solipsistic fake-
ness. There’s no easy way out of 
the awkwardness of the situation, 
no good way to institute “normal” 
human interaction given the banal 
inhumanity of the situation. The 
long rants and confessions of 
various kinds that the characters 
give to each other land them right 
back where they started.
The 
discursive 
dead 
end 
“Wheelchair” depicts points to the 
larger context that frames the play. 
Devon taking Gordon’s furniture 
for free on the brink of his eviction 
can be read as an allegory for what’s 
happening in New York City as well 
as cities around the US, as long-
standing 
residents 
of 
cities get evicted to make 
way for younger and 
richer people.
The journalist Peter 
Moskowitz 
describes 
gentrification 
as 
“a 
theory 
of 
governance 
that places the needs 
of capital over people.” 
While 
gentrification 
in the United States is 
usually 
talked 
about 
in terms of individual 
gentrifiers and, much less often, the 
people it displaces, the frameworks 
that hold it up are less commonly 
discussed. Moskowitz shows that to 
understand gentrification, you have 
to understand the history of urban 
planning, real estate speculation 
and 
the 
almost 
half-century-
long legacy of neoliberalism in 
the United States. “Wheelchair” 
recognizes that Gordon, Devon and 
Sascha are swept up in a process 
largely outside of their own control, 
and it’s sympathetic to all three of 
them without excusing their faults 
and flimsy justifications.
The play seems, at times, to be 
approaching the question of how 
to continue living in a world like 
this, rife with alienation and at 
times downright cruel. All three 
characters largely fail at this: 
Sascha starts out by excusing her 
callous behavior with the folding 
of her nonprofit and devolves in 
her monologue to rapid-fire and 
contradictory buzzwords. Devon 
has so thoroughly internalized 
competition 
and 
individualism 
that he’s terrified of other people. 
Gordon makes recourse to lying 
about his past and proclaiming that 
he’s a “lamed-vavnik,” one of the 
36 righteous people for whom God 
preserves the world. The play seems 
to suggest that these failures are all 
very human, and it doesn’t make 
sense to punish people for them. 
The question of justice just out of 
reach, the play settles for a question 
of empathy.

both distorted and uncomfortably 
close. Often, on the silver screen, 
crime 
is 
sensationalized, 
a 

guiltless opportunity to root for 
the bad guys. But as I articulated 
with both previous installments 
of this series, I found that 
organized 
crime 
can 
expose 
dark truths about identity and 
American values. We don’t just 
consume mob mythology for the 
wisecracking and the brutality; 
under the surface, we connect 
with something deeper.
With that said, the best way I 
can conclude this cultural thread 
of the series is by digging deep on 
one of the most accurately told 
mob movies ever: “Goodfellas.” 

The mafia-fascinated journalist 
Nicholas Pileggi, who penned the 
film’s nonfictional source material 
“Wiseguy” ensured that nearly 
every scene is based on an event 
that actually happened, every line 
of narration an anecdote from the 
stories’ actual gangsters.
The 
result 
is 
a 
nuanced 
spectacle of the mafia that points 
out both the humanity and lack 
thereof among its members. Henry 
Hill, the story’s sharp, laconic 
main player complicates his sense 
of cultural identity when he joins 
the mob. While working at his 

neighborhood’s seedy cab stand is 
all he’s ever wanted, he can never 
truly be one of the family.
“My father, who was Irish, 
was sent to work at the age of 11, 
and liked that I got myself a job,” 
Hill says. “And my mother was 
happy after she found out that the 
Ciceros came from the same part 
of Sicily as she did. I mean, to my 
mother, that was the answer to all 
her prayers.” Henry’s half-Irish, 
half-Italian heritage prevents him 
from securing a position in the 
upper echelons of the mafia. His 
existence as an immersed outsider 
to the roiling, brutish politics of 
Sicilian families not only gives 
the film a unique perspective, but 
shapes Hill’s bitingly sardonic 
worldview.
For playing a boozing, robbing, 
racketeering wiseass, Ray Liotta’s 
performance as Hill is surprisingly 
quiet. Hill’s cool reservation is 
linked to his isolation from the 
mob, his hesitation to always speak 
in sharp contrast to the vitriolic 
comedy of Joe Pesci’s Tommy 
DeVito. Tommy, a total Sicilian, 
is something of a foil to Hill, a 
hypothetical path of even greater 
reputation and criminal success if 
Henry weren’t part Irish.
One of the subtlest moments in 
the film that lays out this parallel 
is when the two are eating dinner 
at Tommy’s mother’s house along 
with Robert DeNiro’s Jimmy 
Conway. 
“Henry, 
what’s 
the 
matter? You don’t talk too much. 

You don’t eat much, you don’t 
talk much,” his mother observes. 
And with his signature calmness, 
Henry replies with a chuckle, 
“I’m just listening.” To that, 
Tommy’s mother launches into a 
joke about a similarly tight-lipped 
man, concluding that “In Italian, 
it sounds much nicer.” What 
better way to articulate Henry’s 
permanent feeling of exclusion 
from the Sicilians around him?
The most hilarious part of 
this conversation, though, is that 
from Tommy’s car, a gagged mob 
boss, Billy Batts thuds against the 
inside of the trunk. Later on, when 
Billy, Tommy and Henry must 
dig up Batts’s body and rebury 
it, the movie goes a step further 
in distinguishing Henry from 
his brutal companions. Tommy 
jests while hoisting his Batts that 
they’re going eat wings at his 
mother’s house that night. Henry, 
in arguably the most realistic 
response to that comment, turns 
away and wretches. As much as he 
accepts and partakes in the mob’s 
violent deeds, he has a conscience. 
His isolation not only blocks him 
from becoming a “made man” 
like Tommy eventually does, but 
makes him less desensitized to 
gore than his fellow wiseguy.
The other fascinating aspect of 
Hill’s ethnic separation from the 
mob is that it may be the reason 
that he was spared from life in 
prison. In “Wiseguy,” Pileggi 
draws 
from 
Nassau 
County 

Narcotics Detective Daniel Mann 
to reveal exactly what made Hill 
an precious potential informant 
for the FBI. “Henry, in fact, 
was neither of high rank nor 
particularly vicious; he wasn’t 
even tough as far as the cops could 
determine. What distinguished 
Henry from most of the wiseguys 
who were under surveillance 
was the fact that he seemed to 
have total access to all levels of 
the mob world.” In other words, 
Henry’s ability to scale effortlessly 
between various echelons of the 
organization the reason he could 
inform on each of them.
In the end, Henry’s illegibility 
to become a “made” boss with 
his own unit working under him 
saved him from the heat. His 
outsider status was a blessing 
in 
disguise. 
In 
examining 
“Goodfellas” through a lense 
of cultural division, it becomes 
apparent that, what separates us 
from those around can shape us 
for the better.
Henry Hill is certainly not 
a defensible character. He is at 
his best a charismatic natural 
mastermind, and at his worst, a 
paranoid, drug-addicted, convict. 
And yet, he somehow gives us 
all someone to root for in the 
underworld of crime. Henry is at 
once a shimmering, impossibly 
magnetic image of the mafia’s 
verve and a wide window into the 
harsh realities of organized crime 
— a brute and a sympath.

HEY.

YOU'RE 
DOING GREAT 
AND WE 
know you 
can do it. 

Don't give up!

Not every theater company 
can attempt “Sweeney Todd.” 
Between its dark humor and 
sophisticated, 
fast-paced 
text, 
“Sweeney 
Todd” 
has 
many 
potential 
pitfalls. 
For 
those 
unfamiliar 
with 
the 
show, 
the complex plot can also be 
incredibly confusing upon first 
viewing.
This past week’s production 
of 
“Sweeney 
Todd” 
by 
the 
University’s 
Department 
of 
Musical Theatre put all these 
concerns to rest. It was a tour-
de-force 
in 
quintessentially 
Sondheimic writing, a captivating 
and convincing take on a famous 
yet flawed work.
The production made use of the 
Power Center’s large stage and 
extensive lighting capabilities. In 
the opening number, when the 
cast sang from the front of the 
stage, lights from the pit orchestra 
shone up on the ensemble, casting 
eerie shadows on their faces.
The 
set 
was 
simple 
yet 
sufficient. Foggy factory-esque 
windows and pseudo-industrial 
brick walls cast a mechanical 
backdrop for the play. It was a 
barber shop and bakery at times 
and a judge’s home at others.
While I usually don’t focus on 
set design in my reviews, I must 
take some time to acknowledge 
the barber’s chair — it was 
easily my favorite aspect of the 
production. As Sweeney Todd 
slit the throats of his victims, 
he turned them away from the 
audience. A mere press on the 
petal at his feet turned the chair 
into a ramp, delivering his victims 
into the meat pie oven many floors 
below.
For those unfamiliar with 

the plot, Todd is a convict who 
has recently escaped prison. He 
believes his wife to be dead and 
his daughter adopted, and he 
vows to avenge these acts. After 
winning a bet with a rival barber, 
Todd opens a barbershop above 
an (admittedly) terrible meat pie 
shop. The pies are made out of 
the flesh of his victims as he slits 
the throats of various barbershop 
patrons.
Abysmal as this plot may sound, 
Sondheim manages to give the 
plot a humorously peculiar spin. 
At one point, for example, Todd 
and Mrs. Lovett (the pie shop 
baker) sing a lengthy, comical song 
about the various professions of 
their victims and the types of pie 
that they will produce.
The talents of SMTD seniors 
Allie Re (Mrs. Lovett) and Jamie 
Colburn (Sweeney Todd) were 
on full display in this scene. 
Colburn was horrifying at times 
and humorous at others, repulsive 
at points and yet impossible 
to ignore. Re was hilarious 
throughout, particularly when 
it came to her feature numbers 
(“The Worst Pies in London” 
standing out the most to me.)
The seemingly indefatigable 
energy of the large cast of the 
show also carried it through 
its 
nearly 
three-hour 
run 
time. 
Though 
not 
heavily 
choreographed in a traditional 
sense, the cast frequently walked 
hurriedly across the stage or the 
upper balcony. I felt as though I 
were amid a bustling 19th-century 
lower-class 
community 
in 
London.
And 
while 
Sondheim 
and 
Wheeler’s lyrics have a tendency 
towards wordy complexity — 
a complexity only heightened 
by the strange vernacular of 
colloquial British English — the 

cast managed to land much of 
their jokes. Though it was hard 
to understand every word, I was 
constantly engaged, more than 
willing to put forth the effort to 
understand the text.
The unusual orchestration of 
the musical gave it another twist. 
It feels more like operetta at points 
then it does modern musical 
theater — a harp and nine strings 
are not exactly components of 
a standard musical theater pit 
— and yet this production was 
approachable and engaging even 
as it was slightly unusual.
In the end, as Todd accidentally 
murders his wife, intentionally 
murders Lovett and then is 
murdered himself, the production 
managed 
to 
maintain 
the 
humorous tone that had carried 
through the work thus far. One 
common pitfall that I have found 
in other productions of the work 
is that it becomes unbelievably 
morbid 
at 
this 
point. 
This 
production, however, managed to 
maintain a light tone even despite 
these deaths.
As soon as the show ended, 
the audience was on their feet for 
a rowdy standing ovation. This 
was easily the most enthusiastic 
response 
to 
a 
University 
production that I have ever seen, 
perhaps even on par with the 
great enthusiasm at MUSKET’s 
“In The Heights” last year.
From lighting to singing and set 
design to acting, this production 
seemingly had no faults. And 
when it came to applause, the 
audience (and this critic) surely 
took notice. As I left the theater, 
I found that I had forgotten that 
this was a student production. 
Had I walked out onto Times 
Square in New York City, I 
would not have been particularly 
surprised.

SMTD’s ‘Sweeney Todd’ 
exceeds all expectations

ALBUM REVIEW
COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Jade Bird’s self-titled debut 
album, Jade Bird, functions as 
both a grand announcement 
of her advent to stardom and 
a declaration of who she is 
and who she hopes to be. Bird 
enters onto the world stage 
with a string of singles and EPs 
already notched under her belt, 
strong and unafraid. The album 
feels like a firm handshake 
and a knowing smile. Bird 
doesn’t seek validation from 
the audience or critics —
let alone amateur college 
writers like myself. Instead, 
the pervading sentiment of 
the album is that Bird knows 
she’s good — really, really 
good — and this album is 
simply her way of letting us 
know.
There’s 
no 
arrogance, 
however, 
in 
her 
music. 
Jade 
Bird’s 
album 
may 
trumpet her long-awaited 
arrival, but it’s a celebration 
of the self (both Jade, and 
the listener), not a display of 
hubris. 
The 
12-track 
album 
contains an enticing mixture 
of vulnerability balanced with 
strength, heartbreak countered 
by 
confidence. 
Bird 
seems 
comfortable within her own skin 
— her own voice — singing “And 
that’s my motto / Don’t let ’em 
near enough to let me down” in 
the song “My Motto.” She’s open 
about her vulnerabilities, but 
sadness is seemingly unwelcome 
in the powerful display of self-

love and acknowledgment that is 
the album Jade Bird.
Yet, 
while 
the 
album 
is 
named after herself, Jade Bird 
is honest about the struggle 
of knowing one’s self. “Ruins” 
open the album with energy 
and gentle acoustics, laying bare 
Bird’s beautiful vocals. This 
vulnerability 
is 
accentuated 
with the Bird’s echo of “I’m not 
sure who I am” — an admission 
that strikes at a deeper question 

of what releasing an album can 
signify to an artist. Yes, it’s a 
mark of success, talent and hard 
work. But the release of Jade 
Bird skyrockets the artist to new 
heights. Suddenly, the woman 
named “Jade Bird” is more than 
who she was. This essential 
question of who Jade Bird is 
hangs heavy over the entirety of 
the album, hinting that this vital 
introduction is also the artist’s 
exploration of her own identity.
Soul-searching doesn’t last 
for long, though. Bird blasts 

through 
with 
anthem-level 
songs like “Uh Huh,” making 
one almost forget her previous 
uncertainty. The amount of pure 
power Bird wields throughout 
the song is enough to entice the 
listener to their knees while 
she sings of control, authority 
and dominance. “Good At It” 
and “Love Has All Been Done 
Before” are full of heartache, 
but again, Bird doesn’t welcome 
pity or pining into her music. 
It’s heartache done the way it 
should be –– full of passion and 
vivacity.
The album closes on a gentle 
note with “If I Die,” full of 
beauty, with the warmth of a 
piano in the background. By 
the end of the album, it feels 
as if Bird has come full circle. 
From opening with a poignant 
question of identity to final 
assertions of “I’m ok with who 
I am” in her final song, Bird 
has seemingly found herself, 
and conversely, the listener 
has finally found Jade Bird. “If 
I Die” is heart-wrenchingly 
lovely, as Bird croons that “If I 
die, don’t put me in stars / Put 
me in words, not hallelujahs / 
They come from the heart and 
they’ll ring true.” Bird never 
asks for love, or admiration 
or acceptance. But here, in 
these final words, she earns it a 
thousand times over.
Here, at least, this writer 
can immortalize the songs and 
memory of Jade Bird as she 
requests — in unworthy words 
that can only beg redemption by 
their bone-deep sincerity.

To honor the end of this school year, 
a few of us in the film beat have decided 
to pay homage to a select few of the 
greatest endings in movie history.
For me, no other movie ending 
better captures the beauty of cinema 
and the power of nostalgia than that 
of “Cinema Paradiso.” The scene is 
simple. Salvatore, our protagonist, 
much older than he was at the 
beginning of the film, watches a 
compilation of old movie scenes made 
for him by Alfredo, his childhood 
mentor. No words are necessary 
— we can tell everything we need 
to know through his eyes, which 
quickly fill with tears. The scenes 
remind him of his childhood years 
working at a movie theater, all the 
things he once felt and all the things 
he’s lost. Despite the tears, Salvatore 
has a smile on his face. Although the 
past is gone, his memories of it will 
never leave him. “Cinema Paradiso,” 
especially its ending, is a profound 
love letter to cinema and its ability to 
help us remember our own stories.

“Good Will Hunting” is one of my 
first cinematic loves and it continues 
to rank in my top 10 for a number 
of reasons, including killer music, a 
knockout cast and some of the most 
quotable lines ever. But perhaps 
the greatest charm of Van Sant’s 
masterpiece is its, truly flawless 
ending.
In the final scene, Sean (Robin 
Williams, “Mrs. Doubtfire”) opens 
the mysterious note in his mailbox 
from Will (Matt Damon, “The 
Martian”), and grinningly reads the 
unforgettable phrase, “I had to go see 
about a girl,” the same last line from 
the story he told Will months before 
about how he met his wife. Cutting 
to the open road and Will’s battered-
up car, we are filled with the same 
sense of satisfaction as Sean, proud 
at Will for driving off into the sunset 
after Skylar (Minnie Driver, “Grosse 
Pointe Blank”).
Simple, yet profound, the final 
moments of the car coasting down 

the interstate, accompanied by the 
iconic Elliott Smith ballad “Miss 
Misery,” fall perfectly in line with 
the tone of quiet profundity reflected 
throughout the film, and distinguish 
this ending as one of the most 
gratifying and full-circle of all time.

 “Annihilation” is not a perfect 
movie. The loose adaptation from 
the first part of Jeff Vandermeer’s 
Southern Reach trilogy was a quilt 
of fascinating ideas executed poorly. 
And yet, many of its flaws are 
forgettable because of the film’s truly 
horrifying final 20 minutes.
In what has to be one of the 
strangest dance-offs ever conceived, 
a colorful pulsating alien transforms 
into a doppelganger of Natalie 
Portman’s Lena. What follows is 
a jarring, skin-crawling series of 
physical maneuvers. The most 
revolting aspect is that the alien is not 
attacking her; It is simply mirroring 
her movements. When she reaches 
out her hand, it punches her back. 
When she runs for the door, the alien 
pins her against the door so it too, can 
escape.
The finale of “Annihilation” is a 
testament to the realization of heady 
themes into a simple yet effective 
conclusion. It demonstrated some 
of the most ambitious filmmaking 
of 2018 and, for the most part, 
redeemed the movie.

I’m cheating a little bit, but 
Hirokazu 
Kore-eda 
(“Nobody 
Knows”) made me. My ending scene 
is not technically the final one from 
“Shoplifters,” but rather the perfectly 
unsatisfying 
rift 
that 
Osamu 
(Lily Franky, “The Devil’s Path”) 
and Shota’s (Jyo Kairi, “Erased”) 
informal 
father-son 
relationship 
comes to under Kore-eda’s artful 
direction. In it, Shota boards a bus 
and leaves the surrogate father 

who failed him, Osamu desperately 
chases, calling Shota’s name, and 
all Shota can do is watch. But as he 
watches, he whispers, calling Osamu 
“Dad” for the first time.
What a way to elaborate on one of 
the best lines of “Shoplifters,” spoken 
several scenes earlier. “If they really 
loved you,” Osamu’s partner Nobuyo 
(Sakura Andô, “100 Yen Love”) 
tells Yuri (Miyu Sasaki, “Samurai 
Gourmet”), whose birth parents 
neglected her, “this is what they’d 
do,” and surrogate mother rocks 
daughter back-and-forth in her arms.
If you know the harsh reality of 
love in families, this is the scene you 
end with: full of hesitation, of waiting 
too long to say important things, of 
not knowing how to say goodbye. 
But in those futile pursuits, Kore-eda 
seems to see the purest kind of love in 
the act of trying anyway. I see it, too.

Go ahead. Make your jokes. 
I’ll wait. “Which ending are you 
picking? Hurhurhur.”
Now tell me: Which of the 
endings to “The Lord of the Rings: 
Return of the King” are you going to 
cut? What catharsis are you going to 
you going to deny the audience, you 
monster? Is it Aragorn’s coronation 
and the Hobbits finally getting 
recognized as heroes? Is it their 
return to the Shire, where they 
realize that despite everything they 
did, life in their home has gone on 
and will continue to go on as usual? 
How about Frodo leaving Middle-
Earth because he can’t cope with 
everything he went through? Oh, I 
see, you’re going to take away Sam’s 
happy ending, because even though 
he’s the one person to resist the call 
of the One Ring, he doesn’t deserve 
to settle down and have a family 
who loves him as much as we do. No, 
these endings are all perfect, and this 
movie is perfect.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


‘M’ extends losing streak in tightly contested battle

With under four minutes 
remaining 
in 
the 
game’s 
final quarter, Decker Curran 
swept across the the top of 
the box towards his right and 
dodged down the alley, firing 
an overhand shot past the 
head of Rutgers goalkeeper 
Max Edelman to bring the 
Wolverines within one goal, 
10-9.
His 
second 
of 
the 
day, 
Curran’s goal brought hope to 
the Michigan men’s lacrosse 
team that it could tie the game 
up, produce a win and end a 
frustrating seven-game losing 
streak.
However, over two minutes 
later, Scarlet Knight attackman 
Adam 
Charalambides 
maneuvered 
past 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
unit 
and snuck a shot past senior 
goalkeeper 
Gunner 
Garner, 
notching his sixth goal on the 
day to end those hopes.
Despite 
the 
efforts 
of 
senior 
midfielders 
Curran 
and Brent Noseworthy, who 
together contributed five of 
the Wolverines’ nine goals, 
Michigan 
(3-9 
overall, 
0-4 
Big Ten) fell to Rutgers (7-6, 
2-2) on Saturday in an intense, 
back-and-forth 
chess 
match 
for contention in the Big Ten 
Tournament.
“It’s really, really hard to 
win Big Ten lacrosse games. 
Every team in our league 
is 
disciplined, 
organized, 
incredibly 
talented 
and 
physical,” said Michigan coach 
Kevin Conry. “If we don’t have 
that discipline and physicality 
ourselves, 
that’s 
when 
9-9 
turns to 11-9.”
Despite 
the 
ill-favored 
result, the Wolverines battled 
with the Scarlet Knights from 
the opening faceoff to the final 
whistle.
The first quarter began the 
same way the fourth quarter 
ended, 
with 
Curran 
and 

Charalambides 
exchanging 
goals in the first two minutes. 
By the end of the quarter, 
Michigan and Rutgers both 
stood tall, as the game remained 
tied, 4-4, with Noseworthy 
contributing a pair of goals and 
sophomore 
attackman 
Alex 
Buckanavage also contributing 
a goal to the Wolverines’ tally.
The 
first 
quarter 
foreshadowed what looked to be 
a high-scoring affair between 
two 
dynamic, 
experienced 
offenses.
However, 
in 
the 
second 
quarter, each side only managed 
to reel in a single goal.
In one of the few offensive 
highlights 
of 
the 
quarter, 
following a feed behind the goal 
from 
sophomore 
attackman 
Kevin 
Mack, 
Noseworthy 
found himself with his hands 
free seven yards out from the 
goal, cocked back his arms 
and rocketed a high-to-high 
goal past Edelman, earning his 
third hat trick of the season and 

tying the game once again, 5-5.
With 
his 
assist, 
Mack 
extended his point-streak to 12, 
notching a point in each game 
this season thus far.
“We all settled into the 
game,” 
Conry 
said. 
“Both 
defenses settled in and played a 
controlled game.”
Taking advantage of the 
Wolverines’ persistent faceoff 
and 
possession 
struggles, 
the Scarlet Knights picked 
up ground balls and gained 
possession on 5-of-6 faceoffs 
in the third quarter, allowing 
their offense to outscore the 
Wolverines 4-1 in the quarter.
“(They) did a really good job 
of controlling the initial draws 
and maintaining possession,” 
Conry said. “They were a little 
more patient with their game.”
Trailing 
9-6 
going 
into 
the fourth quarter, Michigan 
refused to give up and let the 
game slip away from it, as Mack 
and junior midfielder Avery 
Myers each contributed goals 

within the first five minutes of 
the quarter to cut the Scarlet 
Knights’ lead to 9-8.
However, two huge goals 
from Charalambides warded 
off 
Michigan’s 
desperate 
attempts to overcome its one-
goal deficit and iced the game 
for his team
Nevertheless, with a season 
filled with tight battles and 
shortcomings winding down, 
Conry keeps in perspective the 
long-run vision of the program, 
celebrating 
the 
trials 
and 
tribulations of putting talented 
freshman like attackman Bryce 
Clay and defenseman Andrew 
Darby through the wringer in 
games like these early in their 
college careers.
“They were baptized in fire. 
We threw them in a situation … 
with injuries mounting up, (we 
said) ‘Let’s get (them) in and 
have them make some mistakes 
now, so (they) can be better for 
the future,’” Conry said. “It’s 
creating a map for their future.”

Senior midfielder Decker Curran scored twice in an 11-9 loss to Rutgers as the Wolverines remain winless in the Big Ten.

Foster’s first-place 
finish a focal point

On March 29, in Palo Alto, 
Calif., Chloe Foster finished 
first.
Three weeks later, history 
repeated itself.
Competing at the Cardinal 
Classic in Palo Alto on Friday, 
the sophomore again topped 
the field in the 400-meter 
hurdles, 
finishing 
with 
a 
time of 59.69 seconds. Three 
weeks earlier, at the Stanford 
Invitational, 
Foster 
came 
in first with a time of 59.65 
seconds — on 
the same track.
“It 
gets 
them used to 
the 
venue,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
James 
Henry. 
“(It) 
makes it easier 
to adjust to the 
competition.”
Foster 
wasn’t 
finished after the 400-meter 
hurdles, however. Competing 
in the 400-meter run on 
Saturday, Foster ran a career-
best 54.47 seconds to capture 
her second victory of the 
weekend. Junior Julia Hall 
also ran a career-best time of 
55.52 seconds to finish third 
in the event, while sophomore 
Emma Lane rounded out the 
top five, posting a 57.84.
Elsewhere, Michigan saw 
success from two debutants. 
Sophomore 
Alice 
Hill, 
participating 
in 
her 
first-
ever collegiate 3,000-meter 
steeplechase 
event, 
placed 
fourth with a time of 10:04.58. 
In the 5,000-meter run, sixth-
year senior Erin Finn returned 
to action for the first time 
since the 2018 season, coming 
in fifth with a time of 16:09.94.
The Wolverines saw another 
strong 
repeat 
performance 

in the 800-meter run from 
freshman Aurora Rynda. At 
the 
Stanford 
Invitational, 
Rynda placed fifth in her 
career-debut in the event. This 
weekend, 
Rynda 
improved 
upon 
her 
performance, 
finishing third in a field 
consisting of runners from 
Stanford, Indiana, Oregon and 
others.
“I 
thought 
the 
middle-
distance and distance groups 
did well, as well as the 400 and 
400-hurdle groups,” Henry 
said. “We accomplished some 
of the things we were out to 
get, and that was 
to improve our 
performances, 
get 
regional 
times 
and 
set 
ourselves 
up 
for the Big Ten 
meet.”
Michigan 
also had some 
success in the 
sprint 
races. 
Hall 
finished 
fourth in the 200-meter sprint 
and junior Tiana Luton placed 
fifth in the 100-meter hurdles.
With the Cardinal Classic 
in the rearview mirror, the 
Wolverines 
have 
only 
one 
more meet — the Len Paddock 
Open in Ann Arbor — and just 
three more weeks until the Big 
Ten Outdoor Championships. 
It is not all time to prepare, 
though, 
as 
the 
Michigan 
runners also have to deal with 
end-of-semester projects and 
final exams over the next few 
weeks.
“That’s 
the 
challenge 
that we have, but that’s the 
great thing about the type of 
athletes that we have,” Henry 
said. “They can be focused on 
their competition, as well as 
be focused on their studies in 
between. And many, if not all, 
of our athletes are able to do 
that.”

(It) makes 
it easier to 
adjust to the 
competition.

Mixed results at Las Vegas Lake 
for fifth-ranked Wolverines

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 
couldn’t find its rhythm.
The fifth-ranked Wolverines 
experienced 
mixed 
results 
against No. 1 Washington and 
No. 6 Ohio State at their regatta 
in Las Vegas. 
The closest race of the day 
was in the 2V8 category. While 
Michigan was solidly in second 
place for most of the race, the 
Buckeyes became a threat in 
the final 750 meters. Powering 
through the sprint, Ohio State 
ended the race in a photo finish 
with the Huskies coming in 
first. The Wolverines edged out 
the Buckeyes by 0.08 seconds to 
claim second. 
Michigan’s 
only 
victory 
came 
in 
the 1V4 category in 
which it beat out 
Washington by two 
seconds and Ohio 
State by 12. 
The 1V8 came in 
third, crossing the 
finish line with open 
water separating it 
from its competition 
— 10 seconds behind 
Washington and six 
seconds behind the 
Buckeyes. 
The 1V8 came off 
of the line strong, 
rowing a powerful 
start — a strength 
of 
the 
program. 
Trouble came after 
the first 500 meters 
when the boat didn’t 
settle to its typical 
base pace. 
“Our 
1V8 
struggled to establish 
a good rhythm,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mark 
Rothstein. 
“They 
just 
really 
lost the race in the 
middle 
thousand 
and wasn’t able to 
get back in terms 
of 
Ohio 
State 
or 
Washington.”

In the last 500 meters, the 
Wolverines gained a few seats, 
but it wasn’t enough to get them 
out of third. 
This 
wasn’t 
their 
first 
matchup against the Buckeyes. 
The two faced off last weekend 
in Columbus, where Michigan 
fell to its rival by a much smaller 
margin. The boat this weekend 
wasn’t entirely the same as the 
one that came in behind Ohio 
State last weekend. Rothstein 
opted to switch two rowers from 
the lineup possibly accounting 
for the lack of rhythm this 
weekend. 
“I think it was changes in the 
lineup and not really getting 
a lot of time to practice base 
pace in that lineup,” said senior 
Caroline Hendershot. “I think 

that it was still a really good race 
for the short amount of time 
that we’ve been together in that 
lineup from stern to bow.”
And the changes are far from 
over. 
“The lineups will continue 
to evolve over the next couple 
weeks,” Rothstein said. “We’ll 
see where they land but I think 
we have a lot of depth and a lot of 
parity so a lot of possibilities for 
lineups which is a good thing.”
Added Hendershot: “Coming 
away from a race can be hard if 
you don’t know what to work on. 
I think all of us understand that 
we have a really good start and 
a really good finish and it’s that 
middle thousand (meters) base 
pace that we’re really trying to 
find.”

Michigan outplayed by Iowa on 
Sunday in regular season finale

In the waning moments of 
a Sunday match against Iowa, 
Michigan 
freshman 
Patrick 
Maloney faced the task of 
keeping his team alive. Down 
5-4 in the third set, Maloney 
knew committing a single error 
would clinch the overall match 
for the Hawkeyes.
He tossed the ball high in 
the air and swung his racket 
with force, delivering what 
looked like a strong serve, 
at least until it landed just 
outside of the service box. 
Maloney’s opponent realized 
instantly that Michigan would 
be called for a double fault, 
and he pumped his fist as his 
teammates sprinted onto the 
court to celebrate their upset 
win over the Wolverines. 
Following Maloney’s close 
loss in singles, the No. 19 
Michigan men’s tennis team 
(16-7 overall, 7-4 Big Ten) fell 
1-4 to Iowa in the last meet 
of the regular season, after 
an 
uncharacteristically 
flat 
performance. 
The Hawkeyes (17-9, 6-5) set 
the tone from the get-go as they 
dominated the doubles sets, 

winning 6-0 at No. 1 doubles 
and 6-3 at No. 3 to clinch the 
doubles point. 
“We have to be way more 
aggressive 
in 
doubles,” 
said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. “We have to move 
harder, we have to move more, 
we have to get (the doubles 
point) on the doubles court and 
it’ll transfer over to singles and 
really help the guys.”
Losing the doubles point 
to Iowa set the Wolverines 
on a downhill course as they 
entered singles matches. The 
Hawkeyes won the first set 
in four out of the six singles 
matches. And when sophomore 
Mattias Siimar and senior Gabe 
Tishman both lost in straight 
sets, Michigan quickly found 
itself in a deep hole, down 3-0. 
Freshman Andrew Fenty’s 
performance 
was 
the 
one 
positive element of the day for 
the Wolverines. Fenty came 
back from a poor loss in the first 
set of his singles match to win 
the next two and secure a 1-6, 
6-2, 6-2 victory at No. 1 singles. 
That win kept Michigan alive in 
the match until Maloney’s close 
defeat and improved Fenty’s 
record to a team-best 25-5. 
“Iowa did great,” Steinberg 

said. “They played really, really 
well. I don’t think the guys 
responded well to their energy, 
their fight and their tennis, and 
Andrew was pretty much the 
only one out there who did. So 
it’s tough to win a match when 
you only have one guy really 
playing to win, and the other 
guys were playing really tight 
and not being themselves. … 
We’ve had a lot of great matches 
this year as well but today was 
not one of them.”
Perhaps 
most 
surprising 
about Iowa’s thorough defeat 
of the Wolverines was the 
fact that just two days earlier, 
Michigan played one of its most 
complete matches all season 
against Nebraska. 
The 
Wolverines 
cleanly 
swept the Cornhuskers, picking 
up the doubles point and all six 
singles points for a 7-0 victory. 
Though Nebraska’s record is 
poor, Michigan’s near flawless 
performance in Lincoln was 
a stark contrast to the team’s 
showing on Sunday.
Despite the disappointing 
outcome of the regular season 
finale, Steinberg was proud of 
the regular season résumé his 
team has earned, and how his 
players managed to earn a top-
20 ranking in the nation for 
most of the year after losing 
four seniors from 2018. 
The 
Wolverines 
now 
have their sights set on the 
postseason, with the Big Ten 
Tournament starting play this 
Wednesday in Ann Arbor.
“It’s 
a 
new 
season, 
the 
postseason, 
for 
us,” 
said 
Steinberg. “It’s a big slate clean. 
We’re going to have a new 
attitude and erase this match 
and go forward, and I know 
they’re looking at it that way. 
Especially that we get to host 
the tournament next week, 
and the guys always feel very 
confident at home. I know they 
really only get one chance out 
of every 12 years to host the 
Big Ten Tournament, and this 
is the perfect time, especially 
after this match today.”

Michigan’s star recruiting class 
from 2018 continues to deliver

Some referred to them as the 
best recruiting class in program 
history.
The Michigan baseball team’s 
2018 incoming class received 
plaudits nationwide for its talent 
and balance. It was ranked No. 
10 in the country — the highest 
ranking a Big Ten recruiting class 
has ever received — and tallied 
seven 
freshman 
All-American 
awards. Almost two years in, 
they’ve lived up to expectations.
“It’s a really good class,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“When we put it together, we felt 
like it was a balanced, dynamic 
class with star potential – guys 
that had a chance to play for a long 
time and be high draft picks in 
three years.”
As sophomores this season — 
now a year older and more mature 
— they have continued to make an 
impression.
Players up and down the lineup, 
as well as on the mound, have 
begun to take on a more active 
role. Right-hander Jeff Criswell 
transitioned from the bullpen into 
a starting role this year with fellow 
sophomore Ben Dragani’s season-
ending injury. In his Sunday-

starter role, he has helped carry 
the Wolverines to dominant wins 
against 
conference 
opponents 
Ohio State and Minnesota, holding 
them to few hits while pitching 
more innings per game than he 
ever has before.
“He’s hopped into the Sunday 
role and I feel like he’s really 
starting 
to 
come 
on,” 
said 
Michigan assistant coach Nick 
Schnabel. “That’s a guy with 
electric stuff.”
Left-hander 
Angelo 
Smith, 
meanwhile, has brought to the 
table both strength as a starter as 
well as poise and reliability as a 
reliever, pitching the team out of 
jams consistently.
Last year, outfielder Jordan 
Nwogu 
was 
a 
solid 
if 
not 
unremarkable presence on the 
team. This year, he’s leading off 
Michigan’s lineup while being 
key in scoring runs throughout 
the season, leading the team 
with a .366 batting average. His 
performance this year represents 
a significant improvement and 
has been a pleasant surprise to the 
coaching staff.
“When these guys came in, we 
had no idea Jordan Nwogu would 
become Jordan Nwogu,” Bakich 
said. “And that’s been a great 
surprise — the way he’s inserted 

himself into the team since the 
middle of last year has been just 
huge.”
Jack Blomgren, Joe Donovan 
and Jesse Franklin have likewise 
been clutch components of this 
season’s offense with 16 home 
runs between the three of them 
thus far.
The man primarily responsible 
for assembling this transformative 
group of players is Schnabel, who 
made countless phone calls, hosted 
plenty of prospects and took trips 
around the country to assemble 
the 2018 team. He is loath to take 
too much credit, however.
“Well, it came together with a 
lot of work from our entire staff,” 
Schnabel said. “It was totally a 
team effort.”
Bakich, who played alongside 
Schnabel during their shared time 
at East Carolina, was unsurprised 
by his modesty — “as a team we 
try to emphasize the ‘our, us, we’ 
mentality instead of ‘my, I, me’ ” — 
but emphasized the importance of 
his role.
“Recruiting is one of those 
things that’s 365 and 24/7,” Bakich 
said. “Coach Schnabel has no 
off switch. It’s the first thing he 
thinks about every morning, the 
last thing he things about before 
he goes to bed. 
“He’s the best at what he does 
and a big reason why we have so 
many good players to coach.”
With 
senior 
heavyweights 
Jimmy Kerr, Blake Nelson, Miles 
Lewis and Ako Thomas on their 
way out, the sophomores will 
likely need to fill an even bigger 
role come next year. But the team 
seems eminently confident in that.
“I absolutely think they can 
take the mantle,” Schnabel said. 
“Obviously in terms of their ability 
they can, but also in what kind of 
kids they are. 
“They’re serious about the 
game and about their growth and 
maturation personally and most 
importantly, they’re a team that 
wants to win.”

With postseason looming, ‘M’ 
showing grit at the perfect time

Facing the Big Ten’s best 
offense 
this 
weekend, 
the 
Michigan softball team showed it 
could win ugly.
On Friday, the Wolverines 
jumped out to a 
quick 1-0 lead in 
the first inning but 
found itself tied 
heading into the 
seventh. 
Rather 
than being fazed 
by 
the 
surging 
crowd 
on 
the 
road, 
Michigan 
was able to string 
together a couple 
of hits and drive 
in the deciding run.
Saturday’s scene was quite the 
opposite.
Michigan was scrambling for 
any sort of momentum, both at the 
plate and in the field, as it faced an 
8-5 deficit after six innings.
 “I don’t exactly know what the 
biggest struggle was,” said senior 
second baseman Faith Canfield. 
“You just have those days where 
things don’t click, when things 
aren’t gonna go perfect. … Those 
days are gonna happen but take it 
for what they are, just work to get 
better at them.”
The Wolverines were in a 
similar position just two weeks 
ago. Trailing Indiana by two runs 
heading into the final inning, the 
seniors led a comeback that was 
catalyzed by an offensive showing 
Hutchins has been seeking from 
the team all season.
On 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
showed that the scoring it had 
discovered against Indiana hadn’t 
disappeared after one showing. 
One seventh inning later, the 
scoreboard flashed 9-8 in favor of 
the Wolverines — another narrow 
one-run win on the weekend.
“There’s nothing sweeter than 
coming from behind to win a 
game,” Hutchins said. “Those 
are great moments that hopefully 
give us a continued confidence 
and belief in ourselves when we 
get behind. We’ve played well 
from behind. I’m really pleased 

with that.”
Putting on such offensive 
clinics during the crunch time of 
conference games is more than 
just correct mechanics, though. 
This team has something far more 
important than hot bats and well-
timed swings. It 
has grit.
The 
same 
team 
that 
struggled 
to 
secure 
close 
games 
and 
mount 
comebacks 
against 
the 
likes of South 
Dakota 
and 
North Carolina 
has won 21 of its last 22 games. 
And though the Wolverines may 
not be ranked as highly as other 
Michigan teams of this past 
decade, this team is showing just 
as much heart, if not more, late in 
games.

“I think (the grit) came from 
the start of the season,” said 
freshman outfielder Lexie Blair. 
“We took those losses at the 
start of the season to make us 
tougher and just provide a bigger, 
stronger mentality toward our 
next games… We’ve faced so 
much adversity from the start, 
and that’s what we use to just get 
us through the season.”
With just seven games left 
before 
the 
postseason, 
the 
Wolverines are showing they can 
win on days when pitches aren’t 
finding the strike zone and bats 
are connecting with the ball. 
They’ve shown that they can 
win with their backs against the 
wall. And they’re playing with 
a toughness that few teams 
around the nation can rival. 
After Sunday’s win, Canfield 
summed up this mentality best:
“If they’re gonna throw a 
punch, we gotta throw a punch 
back.”

Lexie Blair has the potential to be 
the future of Michigan softball

Lexie Blair confidently stepped 
up to the plate for a fifth time 
on Sunday, needing a triple to 
complete the cycle.
Facing a 3-2 count, the freshman 
outfielder watched a yellow blur 
pass her rather than swinging for a 
chance at that elusive triple. It was 
a ball, allowing her to keep a 4-for-
4 hitting performance intact for a 
team-high 20th multi-hit outing on 
the year.
It’s this type of plate discipline 
and acumen in the batter’s box 
she’s displayed all season.
With seven games remaining in 
the regular season, Blair is hitting 
at a .418 clip, leading the next-best 
batter on the team by .040. She 
also leads the team in doubles (17) 
and RBIs (40) — both numbers 
better 
than 
second 
baseman 
Faith Canfield’s entire 2018 All-
American campaign. The last time 
a Michigan freshman was able 

to put together an All-American 
caliber season? Sierra Romero in 
2013 — she would later become 
the first four-time All-American in 
program history. 
Different years require different 
All-American 
standards, 
and 
Blair plays a very 
different position 
than Canfield and 
Romero. But what 
these stat lines do 
show is that Blair 
has the potential 
to be the future of 
Michigan softball.
After 
Sierra 
Romero’s 
graduation 
in 
2016, 
Canfield 
burst into the scene in style as 
a third team All-American and 
became someone Blair looked up 
to before she arrived in Ann Arbor
“Before I even came her, I 
grew up watching her over her 
years in Michigan,” Blair said on 

Mar. 9. “Finally seeing her as a 
senior, seeing her doing her thing, 
being consistent as she is, the past 
couple weekends have been really 
amazing.”
Now, Canfield is in the home 
stretch of her tenured career 
at 
Michigan. 
With just a few 
more 
games 
guaranteed, she, 
along with the 
other four seniors, 
will have to pass 
off a team driven 
by leadership and 
experience. 
The 
other 
returning 
starters for 2020 
besides Blair will 
be junior third baseman Madison 
Uden, sophomore shortstop Natalia 
Rodriguez and junior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad. They have 
done their job to support the top 
of the batting order, but none of 
them have produced significant 
numbers throughout this season 
like Blair.
Blair doesn’t just get the job 
done as the third batter in the 
lineup. She has one of the biggest 
personalities on the team — her 
walkup song is “Lose Control” by 
Missy Elliott. She has a handshake 
with Uden where she poses for 
Uden’s hand-camera. This energy 
and excitement Blair has brought 
to the Wolverines inspires Canfield 
just as much as Canfield has 
inspired her.
“(Blair’s) a stud,” Canfield said. 
“She just has so much confidence. 
The way she carries herself is just 
never too high, never too low. She 
just goes out there and works hard 
and gets the job done, which is 
awesome to look at. And even as a 
freshman, we can really rely on her 
which is really cool to see someone 
really take on that role as a leader 
so young.”
So it doesn’t really matter that 
Blair was one triple short of a cycle 
on Sunday, because she has three 
more years to achieve that. And 
when she does, the spotlight will 
shine straight on her, just like it has 
been on Canfield, Romero and the 
rest of the Michigan greats.

Wildcat woes help Wolverines 
complete a weekend sweep at home

Eight runs.
That’s 
how 
many 
the 
Michigan baseball team scored 
off 
Northwestern 
mistakes 
this weekend. 
The Wolverines put runners 
on base with walks and hit-
by-pitches, 
advanced 
those 
runners on wild pitches and 
stolen bases and kept them 
alive on fielders’ choices and 
errors. In a weekend series that 
was closer than anticipated at 
times, much of the Wolverines’ 
success came when they were 
able to capitalize on their 
opponents’ mistakes.
“You 
take 
anything 
you 
can get, whether it’s a walk, 
or an error — anything,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“You just try to do whatever 
you can to get on base and put 
pressure on the other team. 
It’s why there’s such a high 
importance of battling with 
two strikes, because when you 
put it in play, that’s what could 
happen. A guy 
could 
make 
an error, and 
you could get 
yourself 
on 
base. 
“And 
a 
lot of times, 
just 
being 
aggressive 
and 
putting 
pressure 
on 
the 
other 
team 
can 
force errors. So, just by being 
aggressive, we got some huge 
opportunities today.”
In Saturday’s 4-1 game, just 
two of Michigan’s four runs 
were earned. The first was 
from 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Jack Blomgren, who reached 
base on a walk before scoring 
on a throwing error from 
Wildcats 
second 
baseman 

Shawn Goosenberg. 
The first game of Sunday’s 
doubleheader saw more of 
the same. After advancing 
to 
second 
when 
Blomgren 
walked and moving to third on 
a fielders’ choice, sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan 
Nwogu scored on a fielding 
error from Northwestern third 
baseman Charlie Maxwell in 
the bottom of the first inning 
to 
put 
the 
Wolverines up, 
1-0. 
In 
the 
seventh inning, 
with the game 
tied at 2-2, the 
Wildcats’ errors 
again 
came 
back to haunt 
them. 
Junior 
centerfielder 
Christian 
Bullock walked 
to lead off the bottom of the 
inning. He then stole second 
and advanced to third base 
on a throwing error from 
Northwestern catcher Michael 
Trautwein before scoring the 
deciding run on a fielding error 
from Wildcats second baseman 
Alex Erro to bring the final 
score to 3-2. 
“It just feels great scoring 

runs for this team, for the 
University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Bullock said. “To score the 
winning run today, it was just 
amazing.”
In Sunday’s second game, 
a 10-1 rout, Michigan finally 
overpowered Northwestern to 
run away with the series. They 
beat up the Wildcat pitchers 
for 10 runs on 14 hits, including 
senior third baseman Blake 
Nelson’s first home run of the 
season and a three-run shot 
from 
junior 
center 
fielder 
Christian Bullock. Both home 
runs came in the bottom of the 
second inning; Bullock added 
an RBI on the day with a single 
in the bottom of the eighth that 
scored senior catcher Matthew 
Schmidt. 
As the team prepares for 
next weekend’s home series 
— another Big Ten matchup 
against a Rutgers team that’s 
won seven of its last 10 games 
and is fighting to stay in the 
race for the conference title — 
the Wolverines may not be able 
to rely as heavily on opponents’ 
mistakes.
But if they can keep finding 
ways on base — and ways to 
score — like they did this 
weekend, they’re looking like a 
tough team to beat.
