U-M prof seeks to eliminate
STEM programs for women

Mark J. Perry 

says programs like 

GEECS violate 
Title IX and state 

constitution

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

In 
an 
article 
currently 

circulating Facebook, Mark J. 
Perry, an economics professor 
at the University of Michigan-
Flint, calls readers to act against 
female-oriented programs in order 
to encourage “diversity, equity 
and inclusion and end gender 
discrimination in Michigan.”

According 
to 
Perry, 
the 

University needs to eliminate 
women-only programs on the 
grounds that they are “illegally 
discriminating against men and 
gender non-conforming students, 
faculty and patients.”

Perry challenges 11 different 

University programs, initiatives, 
organizations, scholarships and 
fellowships at U-M Ann Arbor, 
including groups such as Girls 
in Electrical Engineering and 
Computer 
Science, 
the 
OCH 

Initiative for Women in Finance 
and the Barbour Scholarship. 

In Perry’s article, published 

on 
the 
American 
Enterprise 

Institute website, he claims the 
programs violate the University’s 
Nondiscrimination Policy, Title 
IX and the state of Michigan 
Constitution. 

“It’s important to note that 

university programs, scholarships, 
initiatives, fellowships and medical 
programs that are for gender 
exclusionary (‘women-only’) are 
potentially illegal for excluding and 
violating not just the civil rights of 
men, but are also potentially illegal 
for violating the civil rights of 
students, patients and faculty who 
have non-binary gender identities 
that are not exclusively male or 
female, and would include those 
who are transgender, transsexual, 

genderqueer, 
gender-expansive, 

bigender, dual gender, pangender, 
trigender, genderfluid, or agender,” 
Perry writes.

Student organizations such as 

GEECS and the Ensemble of CSE 
Ladies were originally designed to 
create a support group for women 
within the STEM fields. However, 
Perry argues, these programs not 
only exclude men but violate their 
civil rights. He cites the Michigan 
state Constitution’s portion about 
affirmative action programs in his 
argument:

“The University of Michigan, 

Michigan State University, Wayne 
State University, and any other 
public 
college 
or 
university, 

community college, or school 
district shall not discriminate 
against, 
or 
grant 
preferential 

treatment 
to, 
any 
individual 

or group on the basis of race, 
sex, color, ethnicity, or national 
origin in the operation of public 
employment, public education, or 
public contracting.”

Retired prof
found dead

AAPD investigate 

potential homicide of 

Robert Sharp

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

The Ann Arbor Police Department 

is 
investigating 
the 
suspected 

homicide of Robert Sharp, a 76-year-
old retired University of Michigan 
professor. The victim was found 
dead Monday night in the basement 
of his house on Alpine Drive. Sharp’s 
death, which police believe involved 
foul play, happened at some point 
between Sunday and Monday. Police 
arrived after Sharp failed to appear 
at a community meeting, concerning 
other 
residents 
of 
his 
housing 

complex.

Sharp retired from U-M faculty 

after teaching in the chemistry 
department for 39 years. He earned 
his doctorate from Case Western 
Reserve, studying Multidimensional 
and 
Multiquantum 
NMR 
of 

Paramagnetic 
Systems, 
and 

completed his postdoc at Oxford 
University before starting at the 
University of Michigan in 1969.

Over the course of his career, Sharp 

researched and published numerous 
papers on the paramagnetic behavior 
of electrons in NMR spectroscopy. 
Most recently, his team focused on 
using oriented polyacrylic gels to 
map electron spin. The victim’s son, 
David Sharp, told MLive his father 
was passionate about learning.

“He knew so much about so many 

things that you could talk to him 
for hours and continually learn 
something new,” Sharp said.

Police have not made any arrests 

yet, but they are actively looking 
into the crime. The Ann Arbor Police 
Department tip line can be reached 
at 734-794-6939 or tips@a2gov.org.

U-M responds to 
sexual assault case

Administration 
releases plaintiff’s 
transcript, issues 
official statement

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
officially responded Friday to a lawsuit 
challenging its sexual misconduct 
policy and released the plaintiff’s 
transcript, which had previously been 
withheld.
Filed June 4 by Deborah Gordon 
Law on behalf of a male U-M student, 
the lawsuit claims the administration 
discriminates against males accused of 
sexual assault by conducting incomplete 
investigations.
The case states a female student 
approached the U-M Office for 
Institutional Equity on March 12, 
accusing the male student in question 
of sexually assaulting her in November 
2017. She filed for a no-contact order 
against him in April and later claimed 
he violated the order in a University 

dining hall, though the male’s Mcard 
records allegedly prove otherwise. 
The male student said they did have 
sex in November, but it was sober and 
consensual, and he declined when she 
suggested having sex again.
As a result of the female student’s 
allegations, the case alleges the 
University administration put the male 
student’s transcript on hold, temporarily 
keeping him from committing to a 
graduate school. The male student said 
he was also interviewed by an employee 
from the Office for Institutional 
Equity. Due to the University’s sexual 
misconduct policy, which doesn’t allow 
for cross-examination, the case states 
there was no questioning between the 
two parties.
Citing a 2017 case, Doe v. Cincinnati, 
the lawsuit claims the University 
denied the male student of his due 
process rights by not providing cross-
examination. The lawsuit also claims 
the administration was unfair in 
withholding his transcript based on 
hearsay. There have been no findings 
against the male student thus far.

23andMe allows 
at-home genetic 
identification

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

On Tuesday night, NextGen 
Med 
presented 
a 
discussion 
panel on “The Role of Direct-to-
Consumer Genetics in Patient 
Health” 
at 
Taubman 
Health 
Sciences Library. NextGen Med 
is a group of medical students 
committed 
to 
inviting 
local 
and global leaders to discuss 
current challenges in medicine 
with the University of Michigan 
community. The discussion panel 
featured 
Robert 
Gentleman, 
vice president of computational 
biology at 23andMe, and David 
Ginsburg, professor of internal 
medicine and human genetics at 
the University.
“Direct-to-consumer genetics” 
are services, like 23andMe, that 
provide their customers with data 
regarding their genetic makeup. 
23andMe, which was the service 
focused on during the discussion, 
provides customers with data 
on their ancestral history and 
background, as well as insights 
on 
customers’ 
health 
risks, 
carrier status, traits and wellness 
by 
analyzing, 
compiling 
and 
distilling information extracted 

from the customers’ DNA.
They obtain a customers’ DNA 
through a saliva sample that is 
collected in a test tube and sent 
through the mail, as Gentleman 
explained.
“You purchase your [kit] online, 
and a little while later it comes to 
you in a box. You open the box and 
there is a pretty big tube for spit. 
You go online and register your 
kit, seal it up and put it back in 
the mail and it is sent to our lab. 
These days it is about two to three 
weeks turnaround time in which 
you will get an email for us and 
you can go online and look at your 
report,” said Gentleman.
This 
report 
presents 
data 
based on what a specific customer 
purchased from 23andMe. It will 
either contain a report on your 
ancestry, or it will be a report 
on both ancestry and health 
indicators.
In 2015, 23andMe was granted 
authorization by the U.S. Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration 
to 
market 
the 
first 
direct-to-
consumer genetic test. In 2017, 
the FDA granted 23andMe the 
ability to also provide genetic 
risk 
information 
for 
certain 
conditions.
Gentleman 
explained 
the 
process of obtaining FDA approval 
for their services.

AA water rates to increase

Single-family units 
could pay more 
for water due to 
Council decision

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

On Monday, City Council 
decided to postpone proposed 
changes to zoning codes regard-
ing University of Michigan 
Greek life until July 16. 
The proposal, if approved, 
would require new or expand-
ing fraternities and sororities 
to maintain affiliation with the 
University in order to obtain 
a city permit. The ordinance 
would also set a maximum 
occupancy level for the Greek 
life houses.
Ann Arbor resident Josh 
Winegas discouraged the coun-
cil from approving the ordi-
nance, saying it seemed unfair 
to Greek life homeowners.
“I must urge you to vote no on 
this current proposal,” Winegas 
said. “You have heard numer-
ous opinions suggesting why 
this proposal is unfair to the 
homeowners. I completely con-
cur with these opinions and as 
a fraternity homeowner, I can 
attest that if we were prohibited 
from operating as a fraternity or 
sorority, we’d be forced to sell 
our house.”
City Council also voted 7-4 to 
change water, sewer and storm-
water rates throughout the city 
to better reflect usage. Stantec 
Consulting Services was hired 
to conduct a cost-of-service 
study for this proposal. The con-
troversial proposal is intended 
to better reflect water usage 
throughout the city, specifically 
in single-family homes, while 
others say it unfairly increases 
rates for single-family users. 
Non-residential units would pay 
a flat rate for their water usage.
Effective July 1, stormwater 
rates would also increase by 14 
percent. The proposal is reve-
nue-neutral for the city.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, stated 
that a resident is not solely pay-
ing for water, but paying for 
the infrastructure required to 
transport that water to the resi-
dence.

“I think I reject the prem-
ise that a gallon of water is a 
gallon of water because you’re 
not necessarily paying for the 
water,” Ackerman said. “You are 
through your customer charges 
and piece of your per gallon rate 
but what you’re really paying 
for is the infrastructure to pay 
for that water. A gallon of milk 
is a gallon of milk but if a house-
hold wants to buy 500 gallons 
of milk, you’re going to need a 
larger refrigerator and you have 
to pay for that larger refrig-
erator. Similarly, if a household 
wants to use more water, they 
have to pay for that larger pipe 
and the bigger system to getting 
it there.”
Craig Hupy, Ann Arbor pub-
lic service area administra-
tor, addressed misconceptions 
about the proposal by explain-
ing that the city’s goal is not to 
seek new growth of the system.
“Our policy is that develop-
ment pays for development,” 
Hupy said. “We do not look for 
new growth and extension to 
come out of the ‘right’ dollars. 
This is to maintain the existing 
system and to pay for the exist-
ing delivery of services.”
Mayor Christopher Taylor 
supported the proposal, saying 
water usage varies by user and 
class and must be billed accord-
ingly.
“The different classes we 
serve have different costs of 
service, and this makes sense 
because it costs us more to pro-
vide service to neighborhoods 
because they are less dense than 
it costs us to serve other users 
downtown because they are 
more dense,” Taylor said.
The council voted 11-0 to 
allow vertical expansion for 
Espresso Royale on South Uni-
versity Avenue and 10-1 regard-
ing modifying parking tickets 
to $35 for an expired parking 
meter.
City Council also voted 
11-0 for a new question on 
the Nov. 6 ballot regarding 
a “Center of the City” urban 
park and civic center. This 
comes after a petition with 
over 5,000 signatures was filed 
following a previous rejection 
by the council to put it on the 
ballot.

Schlissel responds to free speech lawsuit

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor 

The University of Michigan 
claims free speech and the cam-
pus atmosphere have been mis-
characterized in their official 
response to the free speech law-
suit. 
“Perhaps because Speech First 
itself has no connection with the 
University, however, the picture 
it paints of the University and its 
policies is a false caricature,” the 
statement reads.
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel explains the U-M has 
been 
mischaracterized 
inas-
much as not only has the Univer-
sity’s vibrant atmosphere been 
entirely overlooked and misrep-
resented, but the role of the Bias 
Response Team has also been 
completely misunderstood by 
the plaintiff.
“Free speech is obviously 
incredibly important to the Uni-
versity,” Schlissel said. “Actually, 
we can’t be a research univer-
sity without putting a high value 
on free speech. You can’t learn 
unless people are free to express 
their opinions whether or not 
other people find them harmful, 
insulting, annoying, disagree-
able — it’s critically important — 
so our policies don’t impede free 
speech.” 
In response to the lawsuit, 
the University has streamlined 
the definitions of “bullying” and 
“harassment” in the Statement 
of Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities. Initially, the Statement 
included multiple definitions, 
with 
dictionary 
definitions 

alongside Michigan law defini-
tions. However, on Monday the 
University eliminated the dic-
tionary definitions.
“The goal is to remove poten-
tial ambiguity,” Schlissel said. 
“We’re changing the way we 
describe things, but we’re not 
changing the function of these 
groups.”
Schlissel went on to explain 
that 
despite 
criticism 
from 
Speech First the University has 
several outlets for conservative 
students, 
referencing 
groups 
such as Young Americans for 
Freedom and College Repub-
licans as well as the various 
conservative speakers like Ben 
Shapiro who have hosted events 
on campus over the past few 
years.
In the official statement the 
University defends the campus 
atmosphere.
“The university’s implementa-
tion of its policies has been com-
pletely faithful to this overriding 
commitment,” 
the 
statement 
reads. “And, in fact, the actu-
al intellectual life on campus 
includes student groups, student 
publications, and outside speak-
ers who are comfortable advo-
cating and debating strongly 
held and sometimes controver-
sial views across the full ideo-
logical spectrum.”
According to Schlissel, con-
servative students at the Uni-
versity feel uncomfortable with 
organizations 
like 
the 
Bias 
Response Team due to mounting 
societal tensions.
“In general, and not just on 
college campuses but all across 

society we are becoming an 
increasingly politically fractured 
society,” Schlissel said. “People 
don’t feel comfortable talking to 
people they disagree with.”
The Bias Tesponse Team 
is a way Schlissel believes the 
University can create a healthy 
learning environment.
“We are responsible for mak-
ing sure that students can express 
themselves 
freely 
regardless 
of the ideas they are express-
ing but also we are responsible 
for establishing and maintain-
ing an environment where all of 
our students feel as if they have 
equal ability to participate an 
environment that is inclusive 
and free of discrimination and I 
really very strongly believe that 
those things are not inconsis-
tent with each other,” Schlissel 
said regarding finding a balance 
between protecting students and 
preserving free speech.
Contrary to the way the Bias 
Response Team is represented 
in both Speech First’s and the 
Department of Justice’s state-
ments, according to Schlissel, 
the Bias Response Team cannot 
investigate or punish students. 
Schlissel said a student cannot be 
punished for an act of bias in and 
of itself. The Bias Response Team 
acts solely as a support system to 
give advice to students, and only 
in extreme cases such as violence 
or vandalism the team reports 
the incidents to the Division of 
Public Safety and Security.

OPINION

420 Maynard St. 
Ann Arbor, MI 48109
 tothedaily@michigandaily.com

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

I 

once roamed the basement of 
North 
Quad 
Residence 
Hall 
during a study break to search for 
a quick and filling vending machine 
snack. As I approached the machine 
hoping I wouldn’t be forced to settle for 
a bag of chips that was 75 percent air, I 
noticed a blue rectangular surprise in 
the left corner: a Rice Krispies treat. 
At only 160 calories, it proudly wore 
the MHealthy sticker on its front. I 
went for it without hesitation. Peeling 
back the wrapper, I exposed what I 
had been missing for so many years. 
The first bite was crispy, chewy and 
soft — just the way I remembered it. It 
transported me to a decade in the past, 
to the kitchen table of my childhood 
home where my mom taught me how 
to make these delicacies from scratch. 
It was the first recipe I committed to 
memory, and though it resulted in a 
messy cleanup, it became one of my 
favorite bonding experiences with my 
mother. But I didn’t realize how long it 
had been since I had enjoyed Kellogg’s 
greatest invention (sorry Nutri-Grain 
bars, it was a close call). I felt nostalgic 
immediately after that first bite, and it 
prompted me to clear the CVS shelves 
of their Rice Krispies inventory on my 
way home.
For some of us, it’s Rice Krispies 
treats. For others, it’s Smucker’s PB&J 
Uncrustables, Fruit Gushers or maybe 
even a traditional home-cooked meal. 
No matter the treat, many of us have 
strong emotional connections and 
memories tied to foods that have 
us longing for a simpler past. It’s a 
powerful, food-induced nostalgia. The 
etymology of “nostalgia” is complex, 
but today we understand it to be a 

yearning for yesterday. It allows us to 
travel back to specific times in our lives 
and sometimes even relive old feelings 
and emotions — like the way I felt in my 
mom’s kitchen all those years ago. By 
evoking these feelings and emotions, 
food acts as a medium for childhood 
recollections. But what is it about food 
that makes it so powerful? Why does 
eating certain foods resurface some of 
our most treasured memories?
The answer may be that food 
consumption 
involves 
memory-
inducing cues that are extremely 
evocative, such as scents, tastes and 
textures. The general experience of 
eating is also significant to memory 
creation and collection as it is 
oftentimes tied to social activities and 
exchange which attaches a new layer 
of sentimentality to our favorite foods. 
The act of eating can definitely be 
private, but we all remember sharing 
food over the holidays with our loved 
ones and during the most social parts of 
our young lives, such as school lunches 
and summer camps. Those images 
suddenly come back when we revisit 
our favorite foods. And, from a more 
biological perspective, our brains are 
wired to form memories about what 
we eat. The part of our brain called the 
hippocampus, which is essential to the 
formation of long-term memories, is 
also home to receptors of hormones 
that regulate appetite, digestion and 
eating behavior.
Perceptions surrounding nostalgia 
are usually negative, portraying those 
caught in nostalgia as stuck in the 
past. But some studies challenge these 
perceptions and suggest that nostalgia 
can actually be beneficial. In fact, 

evoking feelings from the past can 
help buffer people from experiencing 
loneliness. Comfort food that reminds 
us of previous social ties can help deter 
feelings of isolation. Additionally, some 
researchers argue nostalgia contributes 
to feeling safe because foods that we’ve 
already consumed in the past can be 
associated with positive memories, 
which reduces risk-taking. If this is 
the case, it seems wise for food brands 
to play into this “positive nostalgia” in 
their advertisement techniques.
In 2017, Post Consumer Brands did 
just that by bringing Oreo O’s back 
into our lives. After a 10-year absence, 
the iconic cereal reminded us young 
adults of what it was like to eat cookies 
for breakfast. I remember walking 
through the cereal aisle at Kroger 
and reading, “the highly anticipated 
sweet return” on the front of the box, 
and though the cereal hadn’t crossed 
my mind for years, I was suddenly 
convinced the comeback was well 
overdue. While my matured palate no 
longer appreciates the grainy feeling 
that lingers after eating sugary cereal, 
it was definitely worth giving Oreo O’s 
another go.
We’ve grown out of our childhood 
habits to become hardworking college 
students. But that shouldn’t stop us 
from indulging in sugary snacks from 
time to time. Sometimes, all it takes is 
a Rice Krispies treat to send us back to 
our favorite moments. And thankfully, 
science supports our endeavors to 
reconnect with our past.

Ignorance in idols
A

s a society obsessed with 
superhero movies and 
raised to talk about 
our 
personal 
heroes 
from 
a very young age, it is no 
surprise that Americans are 
infatuated 
with 
idolizing 
our 
politicians. 
From 
my 
experience, Democrats love 
to idolize certain politicians 
and figures from the party. 
Some popular people on this 
list include individuals such 
as Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg 
and 
former Presidents Bill Clinton 
and Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
It’s natural to have figures 
who inspire us and inf luence 
our vision of the world and 
ourselves. When we turn our 
politicians into heroes and 
idols, however, we fail to see 
the weaknesses inherent in 
these 
ultimately 
ordinary 
people.
No 
one 
would 
argue 
the idea that no average 
person is perfect, and yet 
many Democrats treat some 
politicians as if they are 
perfect. 
Like 
the 
average 
person, 
all 
politicians 
have 
made 
questionable 
decisions 
that 
may 
have 
had dire consequences. By 
placing 
political 
figures 
on pedestals, we make it 
difficult to criticize their 
actions and separate the good 
from the bad; meanwhile, 
the communities that suffer 
from an idolized politician’s 
actions are ignored.
Ginsburg (also known by 
her 
many 
nicknames 
like 
“The Notorious RBG”) is a 
very popular liberal feminist 
icon. Ginsburg has become an 
inspiration to many women 
as 
the 
second 
woman 
to 
become a U.S. Supreme Court 
associate 
justice. 
She 
has 
worked hard throughout her 
years on the Supreme Court 
to uphold the fundamentals 
of 
our 
Constitution 
and 
support the rights of many 
marginalized 
communities. 
However, Ginsburg has also 
spoken out against a popular 
form 
of 
protest 
within 
the 
Black 
Lives 
Matter 
movement: kneeling during 
the national anthem.
In 
2016, 
Ginsburg 
said 
she considered the action 
when 
Colin 
Kaepernick, 
San 
Francisco 
49ers 
quarterback, 
knelt 
during 

the national anthem “dumb 
and 
disrespectful.” 
She 
compared Kaepernick’s very 
legitimate form of protest 
to 
burning 
f lags, 
calling 
it a terrible act. Ginsberg 
did go on to apologize for 
these 
statements 
shortly 
afterward, 
but 
this 
was 
still her first reaction to a 
Black man’s protest against 
systemic 
racism 
in 
the 
United States. As someone 
who is tasked with knowing, 
understanding and upholding 
the 
U.S. 
Constitution, 
Ginsburg should have been 
able to respect this act of 
civil protest. Still, this single 
comment two years ago does 
not disqualify every good 
thing Ginsberg has done in 
her life and career. However, 
if we talk about Ginsberg as 
if she is perfect, put her on a 

pedestal and call her our hero, 
what message is that sending 
to 
the 
Black 
community? 
Idolizing 
someone 
who 
dismissed 
and 
belittled 
a 
protest 
against 
systematic 
racism could be interpreted 
as a symbol of deprioritizing 
racial 
justice, 
which 
is 
the opposite direction the 
Democratic Party should be 
moving in. 
Another revered politician 
within the liberal community 
is 
Franklin 
D. 
Roosevelt. 
FDR served three terms as 
president, seeing the U.S. 
through 
both 
the 
Great 
Depression and World War II.

POOJA SUBRAMANIAM | WOLVERINES ABROAD

I

t was the first day of my 
spring 
break 
— 
halfway 
through a grueling semester 
— and I was unsure about my 
choice to spend my break in 
Nicaragua. I sat in an airplane 
with 12 of my peers, each of us 
silent, due in equal parts to our 
unfamiliarity with each other 
and the tiredness that often 
accompanies an early morning 
flight. 
I 
quickly 
texted 
my 
parents and boyfriend and closed 
out of Instagram on my phone, 
catching a final glance at the 
clear, blue waters of friends in 
Mexico that filled my feed. I said 
a quick prayer and, like that, we 
were off.
The Ross School of Business, 
with a generous sponsorship 
from the Royal Bank of Canada, 
organized a service learning 
trip 
in 
the 
recycling-based 
community of La Joya, Nicaragua 
where we would work alongside 
International 
Samaritan, 
an 
Ann Arbor-based organization 
focused on serving communities 
that 
live 
in 
garbage 
dumps 
around the globe. In the days 
following the initial morning 
take-off, I would help build 
the foundation of a home for 
Yorlena, a mother who worked 
tirelessly collecting recyclables 
from the nearby landfills to sell 
at a small margin. I would grow 
to adore the 12 peers who joined 
me on our adventure in the 
Nicaraguan town of Nandaime. 
I would practice my Spanish 
while twisting wires with a 
construction worker, speaking 
with him about his daughters 
and wife. I would learn about 
the beauty of Nicaragua from our 
International Samaritan leader 
Tanya and how she decided to 
bring her higher education back 
home to help her nation with its 
most dire needs. I would learn 
how to mix cement and to remind 
my friends to drink water in the 
heat. And I would fall in love 
with the neighborhood kids who 
came and watched us work on a 
new, fortified home, much unlike 
their own.
Yet 
through 
the 
thousand 
things 
I 
learned, 
saw 
and 
finally 
understood, 
from 
my 
own obvious privilege, to the 
potential 
negative 
effects 
of 
volunteerism, 
the 
patriarchal 
norms 
in 
many 
developing 
nations that help contribute to 
these issues and even the manual 

labor that goes into building a 
small home, one thing stood out 
to me. My biggest takeaway from 
my trip was double-edged sword 
of “doing good.” On our first day 
at the landfill, our group met 
with Yorlena and a few of her 
coworkers, all mothers who spent 
their days collecting recyclables 
among the dusty, expansive piles 
of trash. 

Standing near these women, 
I was extremely aware of my 
waterproof hiking shoes and 
the iPhone in my pocket. My 
mind couldn’t help but flit to 
the recycling standards I so 
heavily preached in the United 
States: reduce when possible and 
recycle at home so that we can 
create a more efficient recycling 
process. This belief of recycling 
at the home level carries over 
in what I believe should be an 
international norm. To me, this 
method was always the solution 
to our excessive use of plastics, 
but bringing my own principles 
to Nicaragua would be heavily 
destructive. Yorlena provided for 
her three children only because 
a recycle-at-home infrastructure 
does not exist in the Grenada 
area — with this type of social 
program, she, and many of her 
colleagues, would lose their jobs.
As students at the University 
of Michigan, many of us are 
looking for ways to improve 
the world. Whether we choose 
engineering, business, science 
or the arts as our medium to 
create that change, for many 
of us, it is our final goal. Yet, 
for me, standing in Nandaime, 
surrounded by kind people who 
let us enter their homes and lives 
for a short period to simply teach 
us about their way of life, I knew 
what I had learned – what I had 

thought was right – would not 
help people in this community. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
still 
believe 
we should reduce our use of 
plastics and encourage in-home 
recycling 
internationally. 
It 
is this tension between doing 
what is theoretically good and 
what is good for the real people 
in real communities that drives 
the difficult decisions that come 
with creating solutions for the 
social good. This hypocrisy of 
helping people was, at first, 
entirely 
disappointing. 
But 
looking back, months after that 
first flight with strangers, I 
now realize this hypocrisy is the 
reason change is so scary and the 
reason change is so important. 
Yorlena had a picture in her 
home that’s still clear in my 
mind: she, her husband and her 
children, smiling and holding 
each other, photoshopped into a 
beautiful living room, unlike the 
small, concrete room in which 
the picture hung. Tanya told us it 
was a common practice--families 
photoshopping themselves into 
nice homes for their family 
pictures, 
a 
framed 
escape 
of their own reality. While 
generating industry change and 
positive environmental impact 
may not help Yorlena achieve the 
standard of living she wanted 
for her children, it’ll help others 
move away from working in 
landfills to find more lucrative, 
less dangerous ways to support 
their families.
Back in Michigan, I’m once 
again entranced by idealistic 
solutions, rooted from my own 
experiences and education. I 
know that, directly, my actions 
may not affect the people of 
Nandaime, but indirectly, my 
perceived positive beliefs may 
have 
negative 
consequences, 
consequences that are now no 
longer distant from me. But maybe 
that’s why we travel, maybe 
that’s why we value an education 
abroad so deeply — it shows us 
the people who may be hurt by 
our solutions and challenges us 
to understand the implications 
of our actions and make sure the 
solutions we choose to believe in, 
we can still believe in even in the 
face of those they hurt.

We learned about his 
career 
in 
elementary 
school 
history 
books 
and were taught to see 
him as one of the most 
successful presidents in 
U.S. 
history. 
However, 
this 
image 
completely 
erases 
some 
of 
the 
atrocities FDR committed 
during 
his 
presidential 
terms. Americans find a 
way to conveniently forget 
FDR 
was 
responsible 
for 
the 
internment 
of 
over 
100,000 
Japanese 
Americans and Japanese 
immigrants. 
While 
the 
United 
States 
was 
supposed to be fighting 
xenophobia 
in 
Europe, 
it was creating a similar 
discriminatory 
culture 
within its own borders. 
Many 
of 
the 
Japanese 
Americans interned in the 
United States had never 
lived in Japan and were 
imprisoned purely based 
on the fear that their 
ethnicity would lead them 
to betray their country. 
Tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
Japanese Americans were 
placed 
in 
internment 
camps 
with 
their 
only 
crime being the fact that 
they had at least one great-
great-grandparent 
who 
was ethnically Japanese. 
By no means was this 
FDR’s only questionable 
act during his terms as 
president, but it was one 
of 
the 
most 
egregious 
and 
is 
often 
forgotten 
completely or ignored by 
the general public. FDR is 
one politician for whom we 
should seriously question 
whether to refer to him and 
his legacy positively. By 
referring to FDR as one of 
the best presidents in U.S. 
history or just referring 

to him in a positive way 
in general, the suffering 
of over 100,000 Japanese 
Americans and Japanese 
immigrants is erased.
There 
are 
many 
politicians and political 
figures 
who 
could 
be 
added to this list, if not all 
of them. As we attempt to 
become a more inclusive 
society, 
we 
must 
make 
decisions as to whether 
certain 
figures 
can 
be 
talked 
about 
positively 
after taking all of their 
actions into consideration. 
This article is by no means 
intended to suggest all 
politicians 
are 
terrible 
people unworthy of our 
positive 
opinions 
or 
praise. Many politicians 
perform 
good 
public 
service 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
make 
the 
United 
States 
a 
better 
place 
for 
all 
its 
inhabitants. 
However, 
these 
good 
actions do not necessarily 
counteract decisions that 
negatively 
affect 
their 
constituents, particularly 
those 
of 
marginalized 
communities. 
We 
must 
make sure we consider 
holistically these political 
figures 
before 
blindly 
singing 
their 
praise. 
Liberals can still respect 
Ginsburg for her position 
as the second woman to sit 
on the Supreme Court and 
the good work she has done 
since her appointment. As 
a party, we must be more 
conscious of looking at our 
leaders as humans with 
both strengths and faults 
while 
considering 
the 
harm idolatry can cause.

Ever since “‘03 Bonnie & 
Clyde,” Jay-Z and Beyoncé have 
wanted you to know two things 
about their relationship: They’re 
in love and they’re rich. For years 
that’s the most they’ve cared to 
divulge. They kept their 2008 
wedding as hush-hush as pos-
sible and would almost never 

be caught publicly without sun-
glasses — Jay often opted to 
cover his eyes while they sat 
courtside at indoor NBA games. 
They popped up here and there 
as if to bless us with their pub-
lic presence, but that exterior 
appearance was all us normal 
people got to witness.
It wasn’t until 2016, with the 
release of Beyoncé’s creative 
opus Lemonade, that cracks in 
the perfect marble sculpture of 

the Carters became visible. Bey 
not only touched on the social 
and political nature of Black love, 
but the personal as well; she was 
on a quest for self-knowledge in 
the face of infidelity. That infi-
delity, Jay-Z’s alone, was nothing 
but a tabloid rumor for a couple 
years but made headlines with 
Lemonade and was only further 
made concrete when 4:44 arrived 
in 2017. With 4:44, Jay-Z brought 
his flaws to the forefront, admit-
ting his guilt and asking for 
forgiveness. Who knows what 
happened 
between 
the 
two 
superstars behind closed doors, 

but it seems to them the highest 
form of therapy is making music 
together. And with the unan-
nounced drop of EVERYTHING 
IS LOVE, this unorthodox trilogy 
of healing has its final act.
EVERYTHING IS LOVE rep-
resents a synthesis of Beyoncé’s 
perfect pop formula and Jay-Z’s 
classical brand of rap, but instead 
of being the lavish pairing we 
have come to expect, it comes 
across as a controlled mess. The 
couple’s undying love is at the 
center of the album, but the music 
itself has no heart — there’s no 
sonic flow as the tracklist jumps 
from a sexy string symphony to 
trap-inspired synth banger or 
songs that sound less like col-

laborations and more like Magna 
Carta Holy Grail or 4 leftovers.
If anything, one of the few 
consistent 
musical 
takeaways 
from the album is that Beyoncé 
has cemented herself as a good 
rapper, sometimes outshining 
Jay-Z in terms of technical abil-
ity. She borrows the triplet flow 
on “APESHIT,” trades bars with 
Pharrell on “NICE” and poetical-
ly chides her husband on “LOVE-
HAPPY.” “You fucked up the 
first stone, we had to get remar-
ried,” raps Bey, almost certainly 
looking at Jay dead in the eyes in 
the booth. In this way, EVERY-
THING IS LOVE comes across 
as Beyoncé album that happens 
to feature Jay-Z on every track, 
as he functions more as after-
thought than equal collaborator. 
His contributions are fewer and 
further between than those of 
his wife, and his verses occupy 
the portions of any given instru-
mental at its barest; Beyoncé is 
backed by a soulful chorus on 
“BOSS” while Jay-Z is left to 
work with snare drums and a sin-
gular background vocalist. When 
Jay-Z flips off the NFL and tells 
them “You need me, I don’t need 
you” on “APESHIT,” it’s almost 
as if Beyoncé could say the same 
to her husband himself.
There’s something off about 
this new version of Beyoncé, 
though, as she brags about Lam-
borghinis and Patek Philippe 
watches on a verse clearly writ-
ten by Offset of the Migos (him 
and Quavo lend their ad-libbing 
talent to “APESHIT”), and her 
flow perfectly matches Pharrell’s 
on “NICE,” leaving you wonder-
ing if he just didn’t give her half 
of his verse. In fact, there’s this 
whole manufactured quality of 
EVERYTHING IS LOVE that 
makes this meditative masquer-
ade sound artificial. Each song 
rests on the shoulders of a veri-
table army of songwriters and 
producers: Ty Dolla $ign, Cool & 
Dre and Boi-1da, to name a few.
Beyoncé and Jay-Z are so in 
control of their public images 
that it should come as no sur-
prise they recruited such talent 
to bring this album to life. How-
ever, facts like that make this 
celebration of their love seem 
hollow. The convenient rollout of 
EVERYTHING IS LOVE and the 
two preceding solo albums, along 
with the On the Run II Tour, 
makes the inner conspiracy the-
orist in me wonder if the whole 
saga of Jay-Z’s affair (except 
Solange whooping Jay’s ass in 
an elevator) was nothing more 
than a carefully crafted public-

ity stunt to drive album sales and 
Tidal subscriptions.
Ironically, the best moments of 
EVERYTHING IS LOVE comes 
when it relaxes its precise focus 
on the power couple. Album 
highlight “BLACK EFFECT” is a 
love letter to their own Blackness 
and acceptance of the symbolic 
power they have in their commu-
nity. Jay-Z aims to uplift, shout-
ing out “I’m good on any MLK 
Boulevard” and demonstrating 
the power of unity. The video for 
“APESHIT” is similarly empow-
ering; the two have the fuck-you 
money to rent out the Louvre for 
one night and use it as their per-

sonal artistic playground, juxta-
posing successful Black artists 
like themselves and their team 
of dancers with perhaps the most 
recognizable collection of white 
art on the planet. Jay-Z props 
himself before The Raft of the 
Medusa, a rarity among famous 
paintings as a Black man is at 
the pinnacle of the composition, 
while Beyoncé dances in front of 
the Mona Lisa and Winged Vic-
tory of Samothrace, placing her-
self as the new ideal of beauty 
among those classical notions.
Yet, without the visuals for 
“APESHIT,” the song is noth-
ing more than an elevated trap 
anthem, as the lyrics give no hint 
of its take on high art. And this 
identity crisis is representative 
of the whole album itself: While 
it attempts to shape Jay-Z and 
Beyoncé’s love, success and pas-
sion into a jubilant meditation 
on Black excellence, it celebrates 
Carter excellence instead. Albe-
it tastefully opulent, EVERY-
THING IS LOVE can’t shake its 
extravagant vanity.

FILM REVIEW

Horror is a genre that often 
lends itself to formula — people 
just aren’t that hard to scare. 
The horror film typically oper-
ates under an unspoken con-
tract between the filmmakers 
and their audience: You may 
go see the most recent install-
ment of the “Scream,” “Hallow-
een” or “Saw” franchises and, 
for about an hour and a half, 
you’ll be treated to an adrena-
line rush courtesy of a collection 
of tried and true horror tropes. 
The film will fall into a familiar 
rhythm, and the beats the story 
hits will serve to both unnerve 
the audience while maintaining 
a healthy degree of separation. 
And what does the filmmaker 
gain from this contract? They 
get to refine these types of films 
to a science and pump out yearly 
installments ad infinitum (2017’s 
“Jigsaw,” for example, marked 
the 8th installment in the block-
buster “Saw” franchise). It’s by 
no means a slight against those 
films, as they occupy their own 
niche within the state of mod-
ern cinema; these films are sure 
to entertain, shock and most 
importantly, scare.
Ari Aster’s directorial debut 
“Hereditary” is not one of those 
films. It did not scare me — it 
shook me to my core. The film 
tells the story of the Graham 
family, whose lives are turned 
upside down when Ellen Gra-
ham, the family’s cold, ritualistic 

matriarch, dies, leaving behind 
boxes filled with secrets that 
will haunt her grieving family. If 
this sounds vague, that’s because 
this film evades description. It 
knowingly takes the aforemen-
tioned agreement between film-
maker and audience and tears it 
to shreds, following no familiar 
rhythm and actively subverting 
classic horror tropes. The result 
is a visceral, disturbing film that 
will stay with audiences long 
after the credits roll.
While the film provides gore 
and shocking images abound, 
Aster’s true strength lies in his 
ability to make familiar things 
seem 
unspeakably 
terrifying. 
Toni Collette (“Please Stand By”) 
delivers a truly earthshaking 
performance as Annie, Ellen’s 
grief-stricken daughter and a 
mother of two. In one particular-
ly unsettling dinner table scene, 
Collette shows her acting chops 
as she jolts between overwhelm-
ing grief and blinding, animal-
istic rage. Her unhinged, manic 
face, outlined by the dim flicker 
of candlelight, is one of the film’s 
most unnerving images. 
The film is further bolstered 
from an impressive display of 
cinematic ingenuity from Aster, 
who proves himself as an impor-
tant new name not just within 
the horror genre, but for film as 
a whole. In almost every regard, 
from soundtrack to cinematog-
raphy, “Hereditary” manages to 
impress with its inventiveness. 
One of Aster’s greatest triumphs 
is how well he understands the 

power of the viewer’s imagina-
tion, often demonstrating an 
uncanny ability to decide what 
to show the audience and what 
to keep hidden. While Aster does 
eventually show the audience 
many of these truly gruesome 
and disturbing images, he mas-
terfully builds suspense leading 
up to it.
For all its disturbing imagery 
and terror-inducing moments, 
perhaps the scariest part of the 
film is that at its core, the true 
“monster” of the film is some-
thing decidedly real. Much like 

2014’s “The Babadook,” which 
used the image of an eight-foot 
tall man-creature stalking a 
woman and her son as an analog 
for grief and despair, “Heredi-
tary” makes similar symbolic 
overtures. Even when the film 
does stretch its legs and reach 
into 
more 
outlandish 
terri-
tory, the center of what makes 
it so profoundly upsetting feels 
decidedly real, leaving the audi-
ence with the creeping fear that 
maybe this could happen to 
them. Maybe the apple doesn’t 
fall far from the tree, and maybe 
— no matter how much we may 
struggle — we can’t ever escape 
what we inherit.

‘Hereditary’ contemplates
inherited trauma and pain

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM
Daily Arts Writer

There’s not much to “Tag” that 
you won’t get out of most big-
budget comedies. The cast is almost 
unanimously made up of names 
you’ll recognize from their previous 
work, and you’ll leave the theater 
feeling like at least one of your 
favorites was shafted for screen 
time.
At least a full quarter of the jokes 
will feel like a bad improvisation 
that goes on way too long and mostly 
consists of two or more characters 
trying to talk nonsense over each 
other. There will be a Big Emotional 
Moment that comes out of nowhere 
about ten minutes from the end 
of the movie, when the writers 
realized they couldn’t just have the 
characters play tag the whole time. 
“Tag” ticks all these boxes and 
more, but when it dabbles in cliché, 
it does so with such gusto and such 
commitment to the insanity of its 
premise that it’s really hard not to 
like.
Unlike similar comedies like 
“Daddy’s Home 2” or “The House,” 
there’s an understanding here 
that just putting funny people on 
camera together doesn’t naturally 
generate comedy. The cast of “Tag” 
is actually given ample opportunity 
to show off their well-established 
comic chops — Jake Johnson (TV’s 
“New Girl”) as a stoner, Jon Hamm 
(“Beirut”) as an uber-charismatic 
doofus, 
Ed 
Helms 
(“Father 
Figures”) as the biggest man-child 
in a group of man-children — and 
almost everyone gets a laugh.
The stand-out doesn’t even wind 
up being one of the leads; it’s Isla 
Fisher (“Nocturnal Animals”) as 
Anna, the wife of Hoagie (Helms) 
who harbors an unhealthy obsession 
with the game. Fisher’s talents have 
been unused for too long, and her 
ability to shift between different 
personas at a moment’s notice is 
put to good use here. In one scene 
she’s shocked that she forgot to 
show off vacation photos of her kids 
to a visiting reporter. Soon after, 
she tries to waterboard 

Thomas Middleditch (TV’s “Silicon 
Valley”) so her husband can tag 
Jeremy Renner (“Wind River”). It’s 
ridiculous and absolutely hilarious.
Other members of the cast don’t 
acquit themselves as well, usually 
due to a lack of screen time as 
opposed to any fault of their own. 
Rashida Jones (TV’s “Parks and 
Recreation”) has proven herself 
a terrific straight man in the past 
but isn’t given the chance to do 
anything in “Tag” but participate in 
a tired love triangle with Johnson 
and Hamm. And Annabelle Wallis 
(“The Mummy”) is mostly an 
audience surrogate who sticks to 
the background, though it would 
have been nice to see her get in on 
the action a bit more.
Then there’s Renner as Jerry: 
the crux on which the whole movie 
turns and who ultimately feels like 
he’s in a different movie. Since most 

of the movie consists of him running 
away from the rest of the cast, he’s 
the odd man out, the one who never 
really feels like “part of the group.” 
This is almost certainly part of the 
point, that Jerry has grown farther 
from his friends mentally as he has 
physically in the game, but where 
we understand the relationships 
between the other characters due to 
their shared screen time, we never 
get the same insight into Renner, 
so the Big Emotional Moment that 
ensues with his character late in the 
movie falls comparatively flat.
The upside to this is that at no 
point does “Tag” treat Renner’s 
character like he is bound by the laws 
of physics and logic, which allows 
for unexpected, overblown action in 
a movie based on a children’s game. 
It’s drenched in slow motion and 
accompanied by Renner’s smirking 
voice over. In a time when most 
comedies don’t allow themselves to 
lean into their ludicrous premise, 
watching “Tag” step up and own its 
insanity is pretty refreshing.

Rave Cinemas,

Studios

WILL STEWART
Daily Arts Writer

Of 
Pixar’s 
announced 
sequels since “Toy Story 3,” 
“Incredibles 2” was the first 
that didn’t indicate a creative 
drought within the studio. Its 
predecessor, “The Incredibles,” 
ended with a mole-like villain 
drilling his way through the 
city, signaling that the Parr 
family’s work was far from 
over. And with the expectation 
that every superhero movie 
must spawn at least two sequels 
and sometimes even a complete 
franchise reboot, the existence 
of “Incredibles 2” was never 
doubted.
Brad Bird (“Tomorowland”) 
returns 
as 
the 
writer and director 
of “Incredibles 2,” 
with practically full 
creative 
control. 
Unlike other Pixar 
movies, where the 
director and writers 
split 
duties, 
both 
“Incredibles” movies 
are Bird’s complete 
vision. After a 14 
year break, “Incredibles 2” 
proves that Bird has not lost 
his ability to create a unique 
universe with well-rounded 
characters.
The movie begins months 
after the original as the family, 
in 
full 
Incredibles 
form, 
attempts to stop the same 
mole from destroying the city. 
After the the Parr family’s 
unsuccessful 
attempt, 
the 
government bans superheroes 
from 
fighting 
crime. 
Rick 
Dicker, 
portrayed 
by 
the 
gravelly 
voiced 
Jonathan 
Banks (“Better Call Saul”), 

breaks 
the 
news 
to 
the 
family, and it seems that the 
superhero era is officially over. 
However, 
superhero 
fanatic 
and 
telecommunications 
mogul Winston Deavor (Bob 
Odenkirk, “Better Call Saul”) 
contacts the Parr family with 
a plan to restore the public’s 
admiration of superheroes.
Deavor assigns Helen Parr 
(Holly Hunter, “The Big Sick”) 
to return as Elastigirl and fight 
crime while being videotaped 
for 
publicity 
purposes. 
Meanwhile, Bob Parr must 
forgo his role as Mr. Incredible 
to take care of his family. 
This 
presents 
a 
welcome 
change in roles uncommon 
in 
contemporary 
superhero 
movies — the traditionally 
strong, 
indestructible 
man 
takes 
a 
backseat 
to 
his wife, who 
proves 
to 
be 
more 
efficient 
on 
the 
job. 
Along 
with 
last 
summer’s 
“Wonder 
Woman,” 
“Incredibles 2” is a breath of 
fresh air in a genre flooded 
with hunky men with bulging 
biceps and deep voices.
At home, Bob (Craig T. 
Nelson, “Book Club”) must deal 
with Jack-Jack, the couple’s 
infant, as he begins developing 
a diverse array of superpowers. 
Jack-Jack, whose superpowers 
were only hinted at in the 
original, solidifies his fan-
favorite status with some of the 
movie’s funniest moments.

When justice isn’t served

“It’s so thick I can’t get the 
hair dryer through it.” My 
hairdresser grits her teeth for 
the fifth time as another piece 
of her hair dryer breaks off in 
my hair. So thick, not even the 
best styling tools can make 
its way through its roots. If 
only I had my sister’s hair, that 
allowed for combs and dryers 
alike to slide through it without 
having to worry about getting 
stuck at the base of her neck. 
The solution? Relaxing my hair 
so it was easier to deal with.
 My first relaxer burned. It 
burned and it didn’t feel right; 
the smell curdled my stomach 
and every part of me screamed 
internally, but my mother told 
me it was the right thing to do. 
It was right, I had to, it was too 
much work for other people 
to do my hair. So, there I was, 
with the chemicals I could not 
pronounce permeating and 
burning my skin as I sat there 
taking in the salon. Magazines 
with dog-eared pages a little 
too close to the edge of the 
coffee table, the fan blowing to 
keep the scent of burning hair 
from being too strong for the 
customers, and of course, the 
sound of laughter that seems 
to bounce off the walls of the 
shop. My hairdresser nods at 
me and I walk from the dryer 
to the sink. The water cools my 
scalp, and I close my eyes.
 I am standing in the mirror; 
my hair is straight as I run 
my hands through it in my 

bathroom when I get home. 
Careful not to touch my scalp, 
which still feels tender from 
the perm, I pick up the comb 
next to me and it slides through 
my jet-black hair. Then I throw 
on my uniform for school. I’ll 
finally be like all of the other 
kids at school.
 There will be one more relaxer 
in my life and after that, my hair 
will start to break off, clumping 
in chunks on my pillow, and 
my scalp will itch continuously 
until we realize that the perms 
were, in fact, destroying my 
hair.
 For every Black girl, there 
remains this battle between 
her hair and society. Many of 
us grow up thinking that the 
hair growing from our scalps is 
wrong. It doesn’t lie flat or grow 
down, it grows up towards the 
sky and its roots are thick and 
untamed. So, much like our 
mothers did to their hair, we 
take chemicals and burn our 
skin, close our eyes and flinch 
when the hot comb gets too 
close to our necks and stay still 
in the chair while the hair dryer 
yanks our hair out. Growing 
up, every part of me knew that 
this did not seem right. But I 
didn’t say anything because my 
“nappy” hair did not belong in 
the world. It was meant to be 
hidden and stay that way. Just 
like when my ancestors hid 
their natural hair to assimilate 
into society on plantations by 
using chemicals to burn their 
scalp because it was what 
the world told them to do to 
survive.

After discovering my hair 
did not like being chemically 
straightened, 
we 
decided 
hot combs and straighteners 
were the best options. Driving 
40 minutes to get my hair 
straightened 
every 
three 
weeks created less guilt within 
me, but I still felt I was not 
caring for my hair the way 
it deserved. With time and 
patience, my hair grew back 
and although it was long, that 
didn’t necessarily mean it was 
healthy. So, after I graduated 
from a high school filled with 
nothing but Eurocentric-based 
beauty standards, I decided to 
give my hair what it deserved. 
So, I wanted box braids.
 “Box Braids?” My mother’s 
mouth opens inquisitively as 
her sunglasses are pulled down 
to the rim of her nose. We’re 
at the pool on my senior trip. 
She hands me back my phone 
displaying a girl with box 
braids smiling at the camera. 
She has no clue what they 
are, and it shows. However, I 
know what I want and if there 
is one thing that has always 
made me ambitious it’s my 
determination. I was sick 
and tired of seeing my heat-
damaged hair that limply fell at 
my shoulders when I got out of 
the pool or shower. My hair was 
meant to be thick and untamed, 
not limp and damaged. So I did 
my research and I devised a 
plan to give my hair what it 

I pin my scarf around 
my hair until it feels 
secure. The night is still as 
the call for prayer (athan) 
sings through my phone 
— I close my eyes and 
take a deep breath of the 
warm June air. I exhale to 
the cadence of the athan, 
renewing a sense of calm 
and strength in my body 
after a long day of fasting. 
As I walked down the road 
to my mosque, I reflect 
on the feeling of security 
underneath the crescent 
moon of a Ramadan night.
I’m sure Nabra Has-
sanen felt the same.
The headlights of a car 
zipping around the corner 
interrupt my daze and I 
pick up my pace in a small 
panic, remembering the 
heartbreak that occurred 
almost a year ago.
Earlier 
that 
day, 
I 
came across a video of 
Nabra Hassanen’s father 
responding to questions 
about the brutal murder 
of his daughter. My heart 
ached for him and I could 
see my own father in his 
cries. Last Ramadan, she 
was killed by Darwin 
Torres while walking to 
her mosque after an early 
morning suhoor (break-
fast) with her friends at 
McDonald’s, a spot my 
friends have frequented 
at the brink of dawn dur-
ing our Ramadan nights. 
That could’ve been any 
of my friends leaving the 
McDonald’s parking lot to 
not return again. This cut 
felt deep. It was personal.
It has been almost one 
year since Nabra Has-
sanen’s father called for 
justice in the name of 
his 
daughter, 
believing 
there is no doubt that she 
was targeted because she 
wears hijab.
Instead, the news was 
quick to call it “road rage.” 
Torres grabbed a bat from 
his car and furiously beat 
her face unrecognizable 
and the news said it was 
“it wasn’t about her.”

He ripped her hijab 
off, carried her limp body 
deep into the woods to 
assault her, and the police 
were quick to state it was 
“not a hate crime.”
Sure, 
it 
could 
have 
been road rage — but it 
also could have been the 
same rage that prompted 
an individual to set her 
memorial ablaze.
This incident is far from 
isolated. It reminded me 
of years ago when bullets 
ripped through the home 
of three Muslims in North 
Carolina: Deah, Yusor, and 
Razan. Their execution-
style deaths were attrib-
uted to a parking dispute. 
When you witness and 
experience discrimination 
firsthand, these terms of 
prosecution begin to seem 
naive.
This insidious hatred 
doesn’t only target Mus-
lim 
communities, 
but 
those marginalized across 
the nation.
In order for a crime 
to be classified as a hate 
crime, it must show that 
the crime clearly targets 
an individual due to their 
characteristics. However, 
to be a minority in Ameri-
ca is to know that discrim-
ination does not need to be 
overt or blatantly stated to 
be felt. To be a minority in 
America is to watch as the 
brutal murders of people 
who look like us are less-
ened 
to 
“coincidences” 
and are abandoned in the 
rule of law.
We know damn well it’s 
no coincidence.
We feel ourselves, our 
families, and our friends 
in each name that quickly 
passes through the ticker 
at the bottom of the news 
screen. How many lives 
will our communities lose 
to ignorance and hatred 
that will be labeled as 
else? Does America sweep 
the targeting of individu-
als on the basis of religion, 
race, and sexual identity 
under the rug so we don’t 
have to address the great-
er issue of toxic biases in 
America? Why do we bury 

hate under legal euphe-
misms instead of calling it 
out as it is?
In a call of remem-
brance for Nabra and 
justice 
for 
the 
many 
minorities that are tar-
geted on a daily basis in 
America, I make a case for 
the hate crime. There are 
a number of reasons why 
America is uncomfortable 
labeling these offenses as 
driven by hate. This dis-
comfort in itself is a sign 
that we need to debate and 
explore the semantics of 
them more.
Legally, it is compli-
cated. Once it carries the 
label of a hate crime, it 
elevates a normal crime 
to a more serious offense, 
requiring greater atten-
tion from law enforce-
ment. Police often aren’t 
trained on these matters 
and there is no uniform 
method to track and han-
dle these crimes.
Socially, it is a symbol. 
Hate crimes say to crimi-
nals that bigotry will not 
be permitted in this com-
munity, state or nation. To 
communities targeted, it 
says that they are heard, 
respected and protected 
by the rule of law.
This begs the question 
— is there a reason why we 
don’t take the extra steps 
to make minority commu-
nities feel more safe and 
welcome?
One 
wrong 
interac-
tion, one wrong person to 
cross paths with — this 
is all it takes. When sto-
ries of hate crimes air on 
the news, they’re often 
followed by my parent’s 
“This is why we tell you to 
be careful.” But, we both 
understand that no matter 
how careful I am, I can’t 
control those around me. 
I can’t control someone 
who wants to meet my 
beliefs with a bullet, who 
sees my brother’s skin 
color as a bulls-eye or who 
wishes my friend’s hijab 
were a noose. I’m afraid, 
our 
communities 
are 
afraid and it’s about time 
our laws step up to protect 
us.

SPORTS

Jonathan 
Engelmann 
sat 
in a locker room in Goodyear, 
Ari. listening to sage words 
from the Cleveland Indians 
director of player development 
James Harris.
With an insecure future 
and a head full of fantasies, 
Engelmann gathered with all 
the new Indians signees at at 
Cleveland’s 
spring 
training 
facility in Arizona. That’s 
when Harris reminded them 
all why they were there.
Harris instructed the young 
ball players to close their eyes 
and imagine that it was game 
seven of the World Series and 
that they were part of the team 
that had a shot to win it all. He 
asked them to imagine what 
that moment would feel like, 
what it would smell like.
“Now imagine that’s five 
years from now,” Harris said as 
the players then opened their 
eyes. He then followed with a 
simple question, “What would 
you do every day to prepare 
yourself for that moment?”
Through 
a 
simple 
yet 
effective exercise, Harris had 
inspired every individual in 
that room—least of all the 

now-former center fielder for 
Michigan.
“It’s 
something 
I 
won’t 
forget,” Engelmann said, “So 
leaning on that and carrying 
that through my professional 
career for as long as I can is 
what’s gonna drive me.”
Only a few 
days 
prior, 
Engelmann 
had 
chosen 
to forego his 
final year of 
eligibility 
at 
Michigan 
and 
sign 
a 
major league 
contract. 
Engelmann 
was 
drafted 
in the 31st round by the 
Indians and will now embrace 
the slow grind of minor-league 
baseball.
It’s a drastic change for any 
top-tier baseball player. You 
go from being the go-to guy at 
a big program to working your 
way through the ranks. But 
Engelmann is confident that 
he’s prepared for this moment.
“It’s funny, going back to the 
bottom of the totem pole, gotta 
work your way back up, which 
is fine,” Engelmann said. “It’s 
kinda how I’ve lived and I’m no 

stranger to adverse situations, 
and this is something that I’ve 
trained for at Michigan. We 
always train to be comfortable 
in uncomfortable situations.”
Another 
circumstance 
that Engelmann will have to 
overcome is his draft position.
As 
long 
as 
sports 
drafts 
have 
existed, 
players drafted 
later 
than 
expected 
have 
been 
humbled 
in 
their 
abilities. 
And 
that’s 
exactly 
what 
happened with 
Engelmann 
at 
the MLB Draft.
Heading 
into 
the 
draft, 
Engelmann 
and 
his 
camp 
heard rumors that he could 
potentially be selected in day 
two, meaning rounds 3-10. 
Then, for whatever reason — 
the draft, much like the game 
of baseball, is very fickle — 
Engelmann 
tumbled 
down 
draft boards and was selected 
in the 31st round.
With a year of eligibility 
left, getting drafted that late 
forces the player to make 
a tough decision — stay in 

school or go for the pros. 
Getting drafted in the latter 
half of the draft does not 
guarantee the draftee enough 
money to make it worth it and 
may not set that person up for 
immediate success within the 
organization.
Getting his desired amount 
of money and a shot to play in 
the pros, Engelmann signed 
and never looked back.
Despite being picked so 
late, 
Engelmann 
remains 
optimistic about his future—
but simultaneously will be 
playing with a massive chip on 
his shoulder.
“It’s a chip on my shoulder 
that I’m gonna carry forever,” 
Engelmann 
said. 
“It’s 
something that you realize, 
how lucky of an opportunity 
this is regardless of what 
round, 
and 
I’m 
extremely 
happy with that. I mean don’t 
get me misconstrued, getting a 
chance to play professionally 
has been a dream of mine 
since I was young, so I’m more 
than happy, but yeah, there is 
a chip.
“I go out there and it’s time 
to go and prove some people 
wrong.”
One of the people Engelmann 
will not have to prove wrong is 

Aaron Etchison.
Etchison, a former Michigan 
coach 
during 
Engelmann’s 
freshman 
and 
sophomore 
seasons, now works as an area 
scout for the Indians. Knowing 
what Engelmann was capable 
of, Etchison rolled the dice 
and was able to pick up the 
junior in the 31st round.
Always the first to recognize 
the scope of an institution like 
Michigan, Engelmann remains 
thankful for the connections 
being a Wolverine has given 
him.
“So there’s a great Michigan 
connection right there, just 
one of the many reasons you 
go and get your degree,” 
Engelmann said. “You have 
that 
network, 
and 
there’s 
always one person in that big 
company or firm that knows or 
has studied at Michigan.”
Now 
Engelmann 
will 
depart the team after having 
completed a breakout junior 
season. The center fielder led 
the team in runs (43), hits (74), 
doubles (14) and stolen bases 
(21) and was second on the 
team in batting average (.351), 
home runs (6) and RBI (44).
The 
junior 
joins 
fellow 
teammates junior left-hander 
William Tribucher and senior 
right-hander Jayce Vancena in 
signing major league contracts. 
Tribucher was drafted in the 
14th round by the Colorado 
Rockies and Vancena in the 
31st by the Detroit Tigers.
Engelmann may not don a 
maize and blue uniform next 
season, but his time in Ann 
Arbor is not done yet. He will 
finish out his degree in Ann 
Arbor next year, barring the 
existence of any development 
camp he would have to attend 
for the Indians.
In terms of his baseball 
career as a Wolverine, though, 
all that’s left for Engelmann 
now is to reflect on his legacy 
at Michigan.
“I hope that the one thing 
that I can say a lot in my head 
is that I left the uniform in 
a better place,” Engelmann 
said. “You put your uniform 
down and you think, ‘Did I 
do everything to represent 
Michigan right and be the best 
teammate that I could? And I 
hope that above everything, 
above any stats or moments on 
the field, that I was the best 
teammate and the best person 
and the best Michigan man 
that I could be.”

Former Michigan runner Michael Woods ended his running career at Michigan and discovered a career in professional cycling

Closing 
out 
the 
final 
kilometers 
of 
the 
race, 
professional 
cyclist 
Michael 
Woods was in a solid position. 
Positioned 
among 
the 
front 
group, he knew he’d finish well.
And that’s exactly what he did. 
Woods finished in second place 
at the 2018 Liège-Bastogne-
Liège in Belgium, a feat he could 
only dream of a few years prior.
****
Growing 
up 
in 
Ottawa, 
Canada, 
Woods 
frequently 
rode his bike—but only for 
fun. He’d head to the park to 
attempt jumps and other tricks, 
but beyond that, his focus was 
running. And he was quite 
good at it. Among his many 
achievements as a runner, he 
won gold in the 1500-meter 
race at the 2005 Pan American 
Junior Championships and even 
ran 
a 
sub-four-minute 
mile 
(3:57.48) that same year.
With his success, colleges 
started opening their doors to 
him. Michigan stood out the 
most because it was a good 
school for distance running, 
but also because of another 
Canadian runner who had raced 
for the Wolverines — Kevin 
Sullivan, 
the 
current 
head 
coach of the Michigan men’s 
cross country team as well as 
an assistant coach for track and 
field.
“My hero as a kid was Kevin 
Sullivan who’s now the coach. 
He was my hero when I was 
starting in running and he 
went to Michigan,” Woods said. 
“Basically, in Canada, every 
high school distance runner 
would talk about how amazing 
the University of Michigan was. 
So, it was definitely my first 
choice. And then also, you know, 
I wasn’t a terrible student as 
well so Michigan really stood 
out in that sense as well.”
So, 
Woods 
followed 
in 
Sullivan’s footsteps and headed 
to Michigan on a full scholarship 
to run both cross country and 
track.
But his career as a runner 
took a turn for the worst around 
2006 when he started getting 

stress fractures in his left foot. 
Woods underwent two surgeries 
and had pins placed in his 
foot but still failed to recover 
completely, effectively ending 
his career as a Wolverine.
“I just tried coming back too 
fast. Constantly trying to get 
back into running but never 
really was able to just because of 
this injury,” Woods said. “It was 
not gradual at all. I continuously 
tried to come back.”
In 2008, Woods graduated 
with a degree in English. He 
kept at his running career but 
eventually, the clock ran out. 
Fall of 2011, while racing in a 
10k road race, he sustained yet 
another injury and knew it was 
time to say goodbye to the sport.
Though his career as a runner 
was over, his life as an athlete 
was far from it.
Just as he always ridden a 
bike in his childhood, Woods 
did so in college too. He lived 
near Yost Ice Arena and would 
hop on his bike to get to class. 
After 
graduating 
and 
while 
pursuing professional running 
but battling injuries, he rode his 
father’s bike to stay fit.
Woods notes 2012 as a major 
turning point in his athletic 
career. He’d been away from 
running for some time and was 
working. His then-girlfriend — 
and current wife — suggested 
that he put all his energy into 
cycling.
“She 
saw 
my 
potential,” 
Woods said. “She saw me when 
I was running at my best and 
knew what I was capable of as 
an athlete. She really believed 
in me and she told me ‘I think 
you should make a real focus at 
cycling and see where you can 
take it.’ So I quit my job, and 
she was amazing and helped 
support me when I first started 
out. I started racing that year 
and started getting results.”
When he took up cycling, 
his main goal was to make 
the Olympics — a goal he then 
achieved in 2016.
“I just feel so lucky to have 
been able to go and represent 
Canada,” Woods said, “and just 
be at the Olympics.”

Spikes to Spokes: 

Woods’ new career

First–Drapac p/b Cannondale, 
an American team based out of 
Boulder, Co. that also has a hub 
in Girona, Spain.
“The team I’m on right now 
really stood out because it’s 
taken such a huge anti-doping 
stance,” Woods said. “We’re 
not a win-at-all-costs team. 
Obviously, we want to try and 
win — we want to do well — but 
riders on this team are unique 
characters. A lot of the guys 
on our team are interesting 
people and we’re well known for 
being that team that’s focused 
on doing things the right way, 
making sure we’re not trying to 
stretch the rules or cheat.”
With his current team, he 
races on professional cycling’s 
biggest 
stage. 
He’s 
already 
competed in two out of the three 
Grand Tour events — twice at 
the Giro d’Italia and once at 
the Vuelta a España where he 
finished in seventh out of 158 
riders in 2017 — a tremendous 
accomplishment considering he 
hasn’t been cycling for that long.
“Because I ruined one athletic 
career already I really feel lucky 
to be doing this professionally 
and getting paid to do this,” 
Woods said. “And the fact that 
I didn’t start that long ago, I 
really appreciate how big these 
races are because I was just a fan 
of the sport before. I have quite 
a few pinch-myself moments 
when I’m in these big races and 
there are people running beside 
me up a climb and yelling and 
screaming my name.”
Woods has yet to race the 

Tour de France, but plans to do 
so in the future. So far, he’s been 
focused on the other two Grand 
Tour events, including the Giro 
d’Italia where he was the team 
leader this year.
“Unfortunately, 
I 
haven’t 
done the Tour yet,” Woods said. 
“The Vuelta and the Giro are 
huge races, but the one problem 
with those races is they’re not 
as well-known as the Tour. 
I really wanna do the Tour 
because I’m tired of explaining 
to somebody who doesn’t really 
know cycling that when they ask 
me, ‘Have you done the Tour?’ 
I have to respond, ‘Oh no, I 
haven’t done the Tour. But I’ve 
done the Italian and the Spanish 
version.’”
Woods 
ranks 
his 
second-
place finish at this year’s Liège-
Bastogne-Liège 
as 
his 
best 
athletic achievement. The event 
is the world’s oldest one-day 
Classic race and is regarded as 
one of the five monuments of 
professional cycling.
“I love that race. I’m now 
accruing 
enough 
experience 
that I understand how that 
course works, and I just had a 
good day,” Woods said. “It was 
a real out-of-body experience. 
I started this only a few years 
back, and when I first started I 
was riding the trainer and just 
watching races like this on the 
TV and dreaming of being in 
these positions.”
Since 
taking 
up 
cycling, 
Woods’ life has changed. For 
starters, he’s competing in a 
sport that — although it may 

seem to share many similarities 
with running — he believes is 
very different.
Woods admits he was unaware 
of the differences between the 
two sports when first making 
the transition.
“I thought, you know, because 
I was really good at running I’d 
also be good at cycling,” Woods 
said, “Just because I had this 
engine.”
Now, he believes that although 
aerobic capacity is vital in both 
sports, cycling is much more 
technical and tactical.
Woods often trains more than 
30 hours a week — a schedule 
he says is much more time-
consuming than running. Most 
of that training happens in 
Girona, Spain — the location of 
his team’s training facilities. 
He also spends time each year 
in Andorra and back home in 
Ottawa.
His 
career 
involves 
a 
significant amount of travel, a 
part of his life he missed while 
facing injuries. Woods travelled 
all over the United States when 
running as a Wolverine, but 
stayed put when he took up a job 
between sports. Now, he’s glad 
to be back on the road — and on 
the plane.
“I certainly don’t take it for 
granted now. I really enjoy the 
adventure that I get to go on,” 
Woods said. “We get to go to 
really cool places, and even 
when I train, I get to see these 
amazing vistas and go down 
these really cool roads. I just 
feel really fortunate.”


BELLEVILLE, Mich. — 
The common perception of 
Memphians — inhabitants 
of the great city of Memphis, 
Tenn. — is that we’re tough and 
gritty.
Or that’s what I had to 
remind myself when I trudged 
out of bed before 6 o’clock in 
below-freezing temperatures.
I mean, who wouldn’t, 
right? After all, this was the 
last chance of the year to catch 
the Michigan rowing team at a 
home meet.
Ok, I’ll admit it. I was really 
hoping to just call it quits 
and go back to bed — but not 
because I didn’t think the meet 
was important.
It’s just that, well, I was 
hesitant about everything 
leading up to the meet. 
30-degree weather at the end 
of April? Driving 40 minutes 
to a lake I’ve never heard of in 

a rented car? I could just smell 
the trouble.
But that first step I took 
from my bed was all it took to 
get me up and moving.
The first step’s really all 
it takes to change a person’s 
perspective.
***
If you drive down a rocky 
and bumpy trail while 
following flimsily-placed signs 
throughout the path, you’ve 
experienced the rowing-meet 
commute — or rather felt it.
The potholes in the road 
make the trip quite the 
rollercoaster.
Arriving after several 
fruitless attempts to follow the 
signs, I parked the car in a field 
that was littered with sloppily-
parked cars. Though I can’t say 
I really helped either.
Two steps. That’s all the 
amount of walking I got in 
before a cart — Michigan 
decorated — drove up to me 
and offered me a ride.

Sure, why not. It was a 
confusing path by foot, and I 
was running on thin ice to be 
on time. The staffer who drove 
the cart was intrigued by my 
Tennessee origins.
“Oh, you’re from 
Memphis?” said the grounds 
crew worker. “That’s cool. I 
actually know a few people 
from Nashville.”
Ding ding ding. There it 
is. If I had a dollar for every 
time I heard that statement, 
I wouldn’t be a broke college 
student. So you can imagine I 
hear it a lot. But he shifted right 
after to hyping up the rowing 
meet.
“Just wait until you get to 
the patio.” the grounds crew 
worker said after I told him it 
was my first time at the lake.
I could hardly wait. 
Literally. The meet was 
about to start in less than 
ten minutes, and we stopped 
once again to pick up more 
bystanders.

This time it was an elderly 
couple who were arguing 
right outside their car. Their 
daughter was lost, and they 
were on the phone trying to 
direct her. But “luckily,” I got 
lost too, so I knew a good way 
to break down the directions.
“Just listen to the young 
man’s advice,” the wife said to 
her husband. “He obviously 
knows what he’s talking 
about.”
I was trying to speed things 
up, but I ended up delaying 
myself ten minutes, as the 
husband was adamant on 
explaining the directions 
himself. After the grounds 
crew driver took pity on my 
dying soul, he offered to come 
back to pick up the two, who 
happily complied.
All I could think of the 
rest of the ride, despite trying 
to keep up with the driver’s 
conversation, was, ‘Boy, this is 
a steep hill.”
The cart drove down what 

felt like a 100°-angled hill. But I 
didn’t mind. If it helps us get to 
the lake faster, I’ll take it.
Three steps from the 
cart, which dropped me off 
conveniently close to the event, 
I met up with the Managing 
Photo Editor, Alex Cohen.
“Why am I here?” He asked 
bluntly.
It’s easy to understand. This 
was the first time either of us 
had absolutely no idea where to 
go. No press box. No courtside. 
There was just the lake house 
and the mini-peninsula made 
out of the mud and dirt. So 
naturally, we stuck to the mini-
peninsula.
The thing is, that’s where 
the best view came from. It 
was like a sand-point bar, so 
naturally, you could see where 
the boats started, and you get 
the last glimpse of where they 
break off into the sunset.
***
I had covered rowing all 
year, so I knew what to expect. 

Or that’s what I thought before 
the first varsity eight boats 
pulled from the starting line.
You don’t deal with words 
and numbers any more. 
You’re dealing with suspense 
live stats can’t capture, with 
performances you can’t 
capture with recaps and 
phone-cover details.
Both 1V8s broke out to a 
similar pace, neither able to top 
the other.
The first 500-meters was a 
nail-biter. The lead, which was 
created just briefly, teetered 
between the two teams before 
Michigan created a larger 
separation.
But the atmosphere from 
between the lake-house 
patio — where both fanbases 
anxiouxly waited — and the 
boats had a feeling about it that 
draws you in.
