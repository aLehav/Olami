SPEAKERS ON CAMPUS
University
hosts event
for the arts
Symposium stresses
importance of arts at
research universities
By HILLARY BOK
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's ArtsEngine
- a collaboration among the Col-
lege of Engineering, Taubman
College of Architecture and Urban
Planning, School of Art & Design,
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
and University Libraries - held
a symposium Wednesday and
Thursday to encourage a closer
relationship between the arts and
sciences.
The conference brought
together professionals in higher
education from major research
universities as well as business
leaders and artists from across the
nation to forge a plan to promote
and implement programs that
foster interdisciplinary creative
endeavors at research universi-
ties.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman opened the event
and said that research universities
have been central to her career as
a scientist and an administrator.
Coleman, who received her doc-
toral degree in biochemistry from
the University of North Carolina,
said academics often construct
barriers between disciplines that
can limit collaboration in univer-
sities.
"These barriers limit how well
we can take advantage of the many
academic strengths that exist
within our universities," she said.
"We are limiting our potential for
real synergies and that lessens our
impact as research institutions."
Coleman added that creating
connections between the disci-

DPS Overight
Committee offers
policy suggestions
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Managing News Editor
The Department of Pub-
lic Safety Oversight Commit-
tee released a public report on
Friday stating that non-tenured
University faculty member Dr.
Andrei Borisov's resignation was
not handled properly by DPS.

The report was drafted to
examine the ways in which DPS
dealt with Borisov's case and
to suggest how the department
can improve their practices to
prevent future grievances and
errors. This is the first time the
DPS Oversight Committee has
published a public report in the
past decade, if ever, according to
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham.
After accusing a co-research-
er of scientific misconduct,
Borisov was asked to resign by
the chair of the Department of

Pediatrics on Sept. 4, 2008, after
working for the University for 14
years.
According to the report,
after Borisov signed his letter of
resignation, two officers asked
Borisov to clean out his office
without instruction from the
chair of Borisov's department.
The officers' suspicion that Bor-
isov was taking property from
the office that didn't belong to
him led to a physical alterca-
tion, which resulted in Borisov's
arrest.

'U' camps offer students taste of college life

More than 9,000
youth expected to
attend programs
By AUSTINWORDELL
Daily StaffReporter
For the next three months,
the campus will be bustling with
campers and guests from around
the world as the University hosts
a wide range of academic and ath-
letic-oriented summer camps.
Last summer there were more
than 9,000 participants in a wide
range of University-sponsored
camps, Conference Manager
Bob Miller of Wolverine Sum-
mer Camps said, adding enroll-
ment this summer is expected to
increase as the economy begins to
recover.
"It has been a tough time for
a lot of folks, and I think sum-
mer camps and activities for kids
unfortunately becomes a lower
priority when parents have to
make choices about the discre-
tionary income," Miller said.

The athletic camps range from
soccer to swimming and run from
June through August, according
to the University's website.
The website also showcased
academic camps that focus on
specific disciplines like music,
business, art, literature and tech-
nology.
"These are kids of all ages
searching for knowledge or ath-
letic proficiency," Miller said. "I
believe we give them the opportu-
nity to glimpse inside the Univer-
sity of Michigan experience."
Pamela Staton, the University's
director of Marketing and Confer-
ence Services, said the Universi-
ty's athletic and academic camps
allow prospective students to see
what the University has to offer
and provides campers with a taste
of college life.
"Some campers are so favor-
ably impressed that they aspire to
be (University) students or (Uni-
versity) student-athletes," Staton
said. "The exposure to a Univer-
sity and the impact that it has in
their aspirations to attend U-M is
a huge benefit for our campers."

However, Miller said it is pos-
sible the camps could be affected
by financial cuts in the future as
a result of Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's budget proposal that
entails a 15 percent cut to higher
education, potentially impact-
ing the University's departmen-
tal budgets that fund the camps.
Even with these prospective cuts,
Miller said he still plans to main-
tain the integrity of the programs.
"All I can do is keep working
hard mentoring and motivating
my staff to convey the bestcamper
experience we can," Miller said.
Staton said she has witnessed
an increase in camp attendance
and diversity in the past few
decades, which she said is impor-
tant in fostering tolerance among
youth.
"The more diverse the atten-
dance, the better for campers to ...
appreciate other culture and lan-
guages while having the love of a
sport as common ground," Staton
said. "We love the diversity. We
attract nationally and interna-
tionally."
According to the website, the

cost of attendance for the summer
camps varies based on the type
of camp and whether a camper
commutes from home or stays in
the dorms overnight, and many of
the camps have scholarship allot-
ments that are made available by
the discretion of a camp director.
All University camps have a
team of counselors, the majority
of which are University students,
Miller said. He added that coun-
selors are trained to help campers
get the most out of their experi-
ence.
"These young adults are so
impressive," he said. "Their ener-
gy and concern for the safety and
overall experience of the young
athletes is amazing."
Miller added that camp admin-
istrators and counselors strive to
make the camp experience reflec-
tive of the broader University
experience.
"Through these programs,
summer here becomes an exten-
sion of the learning, exploring and
discovery experiences that shape
our students here during the fall
and winter terms," he said.

University hosts conference on climate issues
for students, faculty and activists on campus

'U' emphasizes
interdisciplinary
approach to climate
change issues
By SAMANTHA NORMAN
Daily StaffReporter
While global warming and
climate change has long been a
problem plaguing environmen-
tal scholars, the University held
a conference this past week in
hopes of gaining the input of
researchers in the social sciences
as part of an initiative to increase
collaboration on the issue.
ICARUS II: Climate Vulner-
ability and Adaption: Marginal
Peoples and Environments - a
University symposium held May
5-8 - sought to bring together
scholars, students and activists

to discuss climate variability and
change.
Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment Prof. and Associate
Dean of Research Arun Agrawal,
said the lack of a social sciences
perspective on climate change
is one of the reasons he decided
to develop the conference along
with SNRE Associate Prof. Maria
Lemos in 2009
Agrawal said close interaction
among scholars working on the
issue led to the conference's cre-
ation, adding that there were few
arenas for individuals to meet and
share their research in the field.
"I was working on adapta-
tion to climate change and I
kept meeting people who were
also working on it and they were
always complaining about (these)
things," Agrawal said.
Agrawal emphasized the need
for more social scientists to con-
duct research on climate change

in order to facilitate more effec-
tive results in helping improve
the state or the environment.
"We really need to understand
how societies and human beings
can adapt to climate change and
we really need social scientists to
participate in climate change," he
said.
On Saturday, the third day
of the conference, about 100
participants from 25 different
countries and multiple interdis-
ciplinary backgrounds were pres-
ent to share and listen to ideas
and research on climate change
adaptation.
Debora Ley, a Ph.D. candidate
at University of oxford who pre-
sented a chapter of her disserta-
tion at the conference, said the
event is important in serv as a
way for researchers to present
current initiatives and possibly
develop ways to work together in
the future.

"More than a conference or
symposium, it's to bring people
together to show what they've
been doing their research on,"
Ley said. "There's also dialogue
tables to see what further collab-
orations can be done either inde-
pendently or together."
Ley- who isstudyingthe crite-
ria under which rural renewable
energy systems can simultane-
ously meet the triple objective
of climate change mitigation,
climate change adaptation and
sustainable development of rural
communities in Central America
- said this conference allowed
her to hear about the experiences
of other people who are working
in the same field as her.
"I like hearing from other peo-
ple who work in Central America
to see what they've found to try
and work together. I like to net-
work and see who else is doing
what," Ley said.

* URC studies impact

Sava to open market

New research
examines effects
of environment on
Michigan residents
By ZACH BERGSON
Daily Staff Reporter
With the help of more than
$750,000 in seed funding from
the University Research Corri-
dor, researchers are beginning
to investigate the effects of envi-
ronmental exposures on Michi-
gan residents through two major
research initiatives.
The URC - a research col-
laborative developed in 2006
between the University, Michi-
gan State and Wayne State Uni-
versity - will use the money
to fund both The Michigan
Bloodspot Environmental
Epidemiology Project, which
examines newborn blood for
exposures to natural and artifi-
cial compounds, and also a study
involving the effects of air pollu-
tion on Dearborn's Arab-Ameri-
can population.
Dr. Howard Hu, co-principle
investigator of the Michigan
Bloodspot Environmental Epi-
demiology Project and professor
of environmental health sci-
ences at the University, said the
funding has allowed the project
to develop a multidisciplinary
team of researchers from all
three institutions.
Hu said his team of chemists,
physicians, molecular biolo-
gists and computational experts
will be investigating the role
that environmental exposures
in early life play in the develop-
ment of diseases and disorders
like autism, Alzheimer's and
asthma.
"There is mounting evidence
that the environmental expo-
sures that matter are those
that occur very early in life, for
some of these conditions, and I
mean during development in the
womb," he said.
Hu added that it is almost
impossible to study the effects
that early life environmental
exposures have on the develop-
ment of these diseases and disor-

dcers later in life. Instead, Hen said
the tata will use prenatal data
collected by Michigan hospitals
to investigate these effects.
"We will take advantage of
the reality that every baby in the
state from 1984 onwards had five
spots of blood archived on the
day they were born as well as
emerging techniques for analyz-
ing those bloodspots to estimate
what the prenatal exposures
were," Hu said.
Hu said he believes the inter-
action between exposure to pol-
lutants and a newly-discovered
chemical structure called the
epigenome - which surrounds
DNA and is responsible for turn-
ing our genes on and off - may
be the culprit in the develop-
ment of many of these diseases.
"We can study the epigenome
from bloodspots giving us now
another tool for trying to fig-
ure out how early life chemical
exposures may impact on adult
disease by affecting the epig-
enome by turning genes on and
off," Hu said.
Many of these exposures
include common metals like
lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmi-
um, manganese, as well as arti-
ficial chemicals like pesticides,
Hu said.
"These are chemicals that
come out of plastic-like com-
pounds that have been widely
used in baby bottles, soup cans,
cosmetics and even medical

Institutional Bigotry
Equal compensation shouldn't be punished
watershed moment is facing the University. On Thurs-
day, the Republican-led Michigan House passed an
amendment that, along with Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's proposed 15 percent cut to University funding, could slash
state funding to the University by a total of more than 20 per-
cent. The additional five percent cut isn't because of conflicting
economic theories or discordant solutions to fixing the current
budget crisis, but because the University provides benefits to
domestic partners and same sex couples. The University can-
not yield to this pressure and must maintain its policy of equal
compensation.

Sex is awesome. I'm talking
about the toe-curling, mind-numb-
ing, stop-your-breathing sex. Seri-
ously, you should try it.
What isn't so
awesome is the
lack of discus-
sion about sex
and all its ins
and outs. Why is
sex kept behind
bedroom doors
and in the back MOLLY
seats of cars? PAYTON
Why can't any-
one say the
word 'dildo' without dry heaving?
So I want to talk about sex,
baby. I want to live in a world
where I could walk into the Ugli
and announce, "I just had an
amazing orgasm" and be received
the same way as if I just yelled, "I
just got my acceptance letter to
Hogwarts!"
Everyone would appreciate the
news.
But I don't even need that much
- ifmy sexcapades were simply
overheard in the Ugli and appre-
ciated by a fellow sex enthusiast,
then we're finally getting some-
where.
There's a silent weight on the
topic of sex. Somehow over the
years, anything sexual became
anything shameful. And trust me,
I went to Catholic school all my
life. I know guilt. I don't under-
stand how anyone can be expected
to have a handle on themselves if
they aren't given a fair chance to
figure it out. And the best way I've
learned to solve problems is to just
keep complaining about it - just
kidding, to have a good old-fash-
ioned dialogue about it.
So when I want to talk about
sex, that's what I want to do: talk.
Not judge, but have a useful con-
versation about something that is
a major part of our lives. I don't
mean to be vulgar or invasive, all
I ask is for people to bring some
consideration to the subject.
Why is sex not part of daily con-
versations? It's one of the most
basic elements of our lives, but why
is everyone so damn uncomfortable
talking about it? Normally when-
ever I bring up sex, judgments are
made or walls immediately shoot
up. I understand other people are
shy and hesitant to talk about their
personal lives, but the problem lies
beyond that. If I'm comfortable
sharing my sex life, I should be able
to do so, butt. get spurned for it.

People should be elated to have
an open discussion about hook-ups
or sexting because we all could
learn from each other. Sexuality is
just like someone's personality or
someone's stretch marks: always
unique. It's so beautifully complex
and personal and one of the most
basic ways to relate with some-
one. You don't have to share every
detail of your most intimate night,
but the next time someone brings
up sex, just go with it. You'll learn
something, I promise.
So let's cut the bullshit, and talk
about what's on everyone's dirty,
dirty minds.
As much as it is awesome, sex
is hard. And by hard, I mean as
complicated as explaining what
a blumpkin is to your RA. It's a
delicate process, but sex is to be
enjoyed. I encourage all forms of
healthy and consensual sex.
There's a silent
weight on the
topic of sex.
Do you remember your first
celebrity crush? How about your
first erection? Remember wonder-
ing why your panties were sud-
denly wet? Or even the sinking
feeling in your stomach when you
caught a glimpse of a love scene?
That's your sexuality. Even
before sharing a sexual experi-
ence with someone else, discov-
ering your sexuality should be
a celebrated process. If you are
completely lost in it, celebrate it.
Don't let my forwardness scare
you. Take your time. You want to
honor your sexuality so that hope-
fully each sexual experience is
positive. Remember it's your sex
life - experience it how you want.
Put your hand down there, watch
some porn, or maybe just kiss a
piece of fruit. Just do it on your
own terms.
Once you explore your sexual
inclinations, share it with the
world. I want to hear all about it,
and soon, everyone else will too.
Until then, you have me. Look out

ing for you.

Snyder and Michigan Republi-
cans have shown the state exactly
how much they care about educa-
tion. Snyder's campaign promises
came close to assuaging concerns of
students, parents and teachers, but
his budget plan and education cuts
have shown otherwise. Snyder's
concerns are not with educating
the future - they are focused on
his conservative bloc. On Thurs-
day, the education budget approved
by Michigan's Republican House
showed the depths of this base.
Funding cuts have two effects:
they either raise tuition costs and
force out the less affluent students,
or they lead the University to cut
programs and reduce the quality of
education. The amendment has all
oftheseimplications,but atitsheart
is something much more alarming.
The University is now being extort-
ed by the backward inclinations of
Michigan's conservatives for pro-
viding equal care and treatment for
its same sex employees.

State Rep. Dave Agema (R-
Grandville), who proposed the
amendment, stated that the Uni-
versity is breakingstate law, and he
is correct. Despite this, pushing for
civil rights and conducting business
in accordance with the morality
of equality is the path the Univer-
sity has chosen. Unfortunately, the
lawmakers of Michigan are more
concerned with reduction of civil
liberties than with the education
of the state's youth, and will even
harm students in an attempt to
coerce universities into emulating
the legislators' bigotry.
The importance of lower tuition
cannot be emphasized enough,
since its financial accessibility is
essential for the general progres-
sion of society. Equality and civil
liberty, however, are principles that
are more important and inherent
than the provision of education. To
ask the University to do anything
besides maintain its policy of equal
treatmentand compensation would

be nothingshortofaviolation of the
principles the University has come
to standfor.
The University must choose
between providing the best educa-
tion and treating its employees with
equality. In the event of this law
passing, the University may have to
make painful cuts to its programs
and the quality of education may
decline, but the alternative cannot
be an option. Michigan's Senate
and Snyder must prevent this bill
from becoming law and block this
destructive new cut to education.
But the assault will not end there,
since University policy currently'
violates Michigan's laws. In the
event that the new amendment is
passed, a redrafting ofthe state con-
stitution or a proposal that allows
same-sex benefits is the only thing
that can prevent cuts like this from
passing in the future. In the mean-
time, there is little the University
can do besides brace for cuts and
hold its head high.

Beth inking activism

When I walk under the West
Hall corridor, jostled by people
on either side, endangered by
weaving bik-_
ers, 5 know
what's to
come ina few
more steps.
The Diag
guarantees
a barrage of -
flyers, post- BLAKE
ers, causes OBI
and fundrais-_
ers. Everyone
is trying to sell you something,
cure cancer or save Darfur. They
want your change, your time and
your conviction.
The idea behind it all is valid
and the participants' hearts are
probably in the right places - but
at some point we all need to step
back and ask, what is all of this
really doing? How is a flyer going
to benefit anything when there is
a good chance it will end up in the
garbage two feet away? It's wast-
ed paper and a wasted attempt to
solicit compassion. Don't get me
wrong, my heart hurts for Darfur
too, but I'm not going to waste a
bunch of trees to inform educat-
ed, liberal college students about
shit they already know. Convinc-
ing a student at the University of
Michigan that horrible things are
happening in Northern Africa
and Tibet and Darfur is like going
down to the Westboro Baptist
Church and persuading the con-
gregation that being gay is a sin.
You're not going to be breaking
any new ground.
Day upon day, flyers are shoved
in my face - "Please come to our
show"; "Animal cruelty is com-
promising ethical values"; "Give
to the Japan relief fund." I don't

mean to pick on people trying to
make a difference, but don't call
yourself an activist for sitting at a
booth in the lobby of Angell Hall
raising pennies for countries that
need more than pocket change.
We live in a world of information
technology which is following
an exponential growth curve -
enlightening an educated portion
of the public of the tragedies and
travesties of mankind isn't goingto
do anything or offer anythingnew.
These menial efforts are hurting
and belittling the causes they are
trying to support. The market of
humanitarianism is so over-sat-
urated; a cause that actually has
merit is diminished to "just anoth-
er." This is the tragedy of incessant
"flyering" and the spawn for my
criticism. I do care aboutorganiza-
tions that are making a difference,
we just need to assess our involve-
ment and its impact.
We need to start being kinder
to the people around us. If we
can't build a community and sup-
port our neighbors in need, how
are we going to unite the world?
Activism starts small and gets
big. If you want to go to Japan
and volunteer in the earthquake
relief forces, my hat is off to you
because that's making a differ-
ence. But if that's not on your
agenda at the moment, quit try-
ing to raise degrading pennies
for people suffering and dying
from nuclear radiation. A mother
of one of the Japanese workers
in charge of removing radiation
from citizens spoke about her son
on a Fox News interview, saying,
"He told me (the workers) have
accepted that they will all prob-
ably die from radiation sickness
in the short term or cancer in the
longterm." These people are will-

ing to die in order to carry their
neighbors in times of crisis. Japan
is a stable nation that's more than
capable, both physically and fis-
cally, to conduct a proper rehabil-
itation from this disaster. Natural
disasters of this scale are hor-
rific and it tears at our hearts and
emotions - but quick emotional
responses and knee-jerk reac-
tions to donate a few dollars are
not going to help Japan.
Those in need
need more than
pocket change.
I am no authority on humani-
tarianism and activism, and I don't
have a solution or a "better way"
for you to get involved, but I feel
that our focus could be used more
effectively. Maybe start by reduc-
ingyour personal carbonfootprint,
picking up trash outside or feeding
someone who is hungry. These are
direct actions that give results and
make an impact. How much ener-
gy is wasted printing those flyers
and posters that are so liberally
distributed to the masses? How
much paper is consumed? It seems
a little backwards to me - we want
to help people in need, but in doing
so we consume epic amounts of
resources and leave those in need
only superficially aided. So next
time someone shoves a flyer in
your face on the Diag - just keep
walking.

Website aids students
in learning languages

Bilingual Chat
provides practice of
foreign languages
By YOUNJOO SANG
For the Daily
Learning a foreign language
is often a daunting task for
many students, but with a new
social network catered specifi-
cally towards people striving
to improve their speaking and
writing skills, this process may
become a bit easier.
Bilingualchat.com, a free online
website launched in April, aims to
help people who are learning for-
eign languages by fostering com-
munication with others also using
that language through email, chat
rooms and video chat.
The website is similar to other
social networking websites - fea-
turing profiles where users can
post messages - and allows people
to join chat rooms in 53 different
languages, as well as participate in
blogs and forums about different
countries and cultures.
Bilingual Chat also provides
features such as an online trans-
lator and a system that supports
multiple keyboards, allowing users
to type in several foreign scripts.
Jamie Sprenger, creator of
Bilingual Chat, wrote in an e-mail
interview she developed the web-
site as a way to maintain her for-
eign language skills. Sprenger
came up with the website's con-
cept last summer after realizing
she wasn't speaking Spanish and
Portuguese as much while she was
busy learning French and Italian.
"I realized that if I didn't prac-
tice my Spanish and Portuguese,
I was going to forget everything
I'd spent so many years learning,"
Sprenger wrote.
Sprenger added she has always
been interested in having an inter-
national pen pal, and even tried
to find one online while studying

Spanish in high school and college.
"I put an ad on an English web-
site seeking a foreign language
partner, but never seemed to find
the time to organize a meet-up,"
she wrote. "It was too complicated
to coordinate schedules, travel
across London to meet the people,
and to be honest I was way too shy
and nervous. I wanted to chat with
international friends online."
After encountering difficulty in
practicing languages with others,
Sprenger came up with the idea to
create a website that would make
it easier for herself and others to
interact.
"I decided that since what I
needed wasn't available, I'd create
it myself," Sprenger said.
While it is a new website,
Sprenger said she has high hopes
for Bilingual Chat, including
increasing membership though
she wrote it is already "growing
extremely rapidly."
Like Sprenger, students at the
University said they also want to
improve their foreign language
speaking skills through interac-
tion with others. LSA junior Mat-
thew Hardison, who took Spanish
at the University, said he feels
there has been a lack of emphasis
on speaking in the curriculum.
"I feel like they never really
stressed the speaking of the lan-
guage," Hardison said.
Hardison added that a website
like Bilingual Chat would have
been helpful while he was learn-
ing Spanish.
"I thought there should be a
separate hour for speaking (during
language classes)," Hardison said.
Business and Kinesiology junior
Brandon Rhodes said Bilingual
Chat would also be beneficial
because it allows students to speak
with native speakers.
"Talking to people from that
area would be helpful," Rhodes
said. "In a classroom setting, you
learn how to read and write, but
speaking isn't something that
comes naturally."

SYMPOSIUM
From Page 1
plines is difficult, but ultimate-
ly is rewardinghwork for both
research and the education of
students.
"Our graduates must be pre-
pared to address the very messy
problems presented by the world
and these problems are not neatly
contained by disciplinary bound-
aries," Coleman said.
"Ensuring that art making
and the arts are tightly woven
into the fabric of the research
university ensures that gradu-
ates can and will contribute more
effectively to society. It is imper-
ative that we continue to find
ways to help students develop
their full creative and cognitive
skills," she added.
After speaking, Coleman
introduced Shirley Tilghman,
presidentof Princeton University,
who applauded the University for
hosting the conference dedicated
to the importance of the arts at
SAWAS
From Page 3
"I want people to come to the
market and want to spend an hour
and a half here...I grew up in New
York City...that's one of the things
we really miss, these amazing
markets," Lelcaj said.
Though restaurants and mar-
kets like Zingerman's, White Mar-
ket and Replenish are all located in
Ann Arbor and easily accessible to
students, Lelcaj said she is not wor-
ried about competition due to the
difference in location and prod-
ucts.
"(Zingerman's) has a really
unique style of product and style of
service ... and it's really out of the
way in terms of the demographic
we're tryingto market to," she said.
Lelcaj said she hopes to add
valet parking at some point as well
as a garden where she can grow
herbs, allowing her to expand fla-
vors and change the items on her
restaurant's menu without having
to increase prices.
Sarah Power, Lelcaj's director of
operations, said she is enthusiastic
about the addition of the market to
the Washington Street area.
"Generally, we are branding

research universities.
In her address, Tilghman said
educators are often focused on
the importance of studying the
arts and creating opportunities
for its creation in conjunction
with the application of sciences.
She added that this discussion
takes place in a time of financial
hardship, and issues with funding
often cause the arts to disappear
first at educational institutions.
"The ultimate goal of this
meeting is to drive national
momentum to develop better
ways to integrate art making and
the arts into the research univer-
sity - something that is critically
important to the health of the
arts, our institutions, and Ameri-
can society," Tilghman said.
Tilghman also said the pro-
duction of art has benefited
Princeton's campus. She men-
tioned several examples of inter-
disciplinary creative efforts that
enhanced the quality of learning
and the appreciation for art at
Princeton.
"For me, the first and fore-
most reason for cultivating art
ourselves as Ann Arbor's most
comprehensive local and inter-
national food emporium and pre-
pared food shop," Power said.
Power said the market will pro-
vide customers with an experience
that is different from similar busi-
nesses in Ann Arbor, adding that
they hope to eventually deliver
groceries to "people who are work-
ing or at home with tons of kids and
don't have time to go grocery shop-
ping."
Power said she is not worried
about Subway being right next-
door to where the market will be
because their market has an edge
over more commercial businesses.
"With any kind of corporate
chain you're getting consistency,"
Power said. "The difference with
us is that because we're going to
be doing things seasonally...and
changing distributors and farms,
it's really a personal thing."
LSA sophomore Justin Collins,
a resident at Sterling 411 Lofts, said
he is looking forward to having a
market in the building.
"It adds to the convenience
of living here," Collins said.
"Because this is not necessarily a
great location, it's not very close
to many markets."
Music, Theatre & Dance and

making on our campus is the
impetus it gives to a discrete and
crucial way of interacting with
the world," Tilghman said. "Just
as disciplines like mathematics
and philosophy demand that we
both think and express ourselves
in specific languages, the arts
engender a unique creative sen-
sibility."
The opening night of the
symposium, titled "The role of'
art-making and the arts in the
research university", also includ-
ed speeches from the deans of the
four schools on North Campus.
Rackham Dean and Vice Pro-
vost for Academic Affairs Janet
Weiss said the idea for the con-
ference emerged from the part-
nership among the four schools
as part of an initiative to increase
arts efforts on campus.
"The deans have been work-
ing together with imagination
and gusto to accelerate the cre-
ative output of the Michigan
community and to deepen our
collective involvement in arts
throughout the University,"
Weiss said.
LSA junior Ashley Park said the
market's location will be conve-
nient for students because there
are not many other markets in the
vicinity.
"There's not a lot of places
with fresh produce around here,
I think the closest is Sparrow
Market" Park said. "Kerrytown
doesn't seem very far away, but
it's actually quite a walk, espe-
cially in the winter."
LSA sophomore Emily Jaffe
said that while she anticipates
that the store will be expensive,
she will still come to the store
from time to time once it opens.
"It will be great to have food
nearby, as long as it's healthy
food it will be nice to have," she
said. "I'm assuming it's going to
be kind of pricey, so I'll probably
just shop there once in a while."
Jaffe added that she thinks the
market will attract more people
to the Washington Street area.
"It doesn't seem as busy here as
Liberty or Main Street," she said.
"I think it will draw some more
people over here. Subway is nice
to have, but I don't think it draws
the same crowd."

New superhero falls
victim to old tricks
By DAVID TAO
DailyFilm Editor
A contemporary Marvel block-
buster is unmistakable. There'll be
the guy in the cape and/or armor
and/or spandex (obviously). Then
there are the bit characters who
constantly name-
drop S.H.LE.L.D **
(for the uncon-
verted, that's the Tor
super-secret spy
agency that runs At Quality16
all the superhe- and Rave
roes). There's the Paramount
traditional post-
'credits appearance by S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent Nick Fury, played by Samuel
L. Jackson ("Snakes on a Plane") and
his badass eye patch. And there are
the Easter eggs littered throughout
each film, props and cameos adver-
tising future blockbusters featur-
ing additional characters from the
unending Marvel pantheon.
"Thor," the latest off the Mar-
vel assembly line, is no exception.
In addition to the titular Thun-
der God (Chris Hemsworth, "Star
Trek"), clad in cape and armor and
what look like spandex leggings,
there's a cameo appearance by Jer-
emy Renner ("The Hurt Locker")
as Hawkeye, hinting at the Aveng-
ers movie currently in production.
And of course, there's a post-credit
- sequence featuring both Jackson
and a comic book MacGuffin teas-

ing the upcoming Captain America
movie. It's a cookie-cutter product
subtly plugging future cookie-cutter
products. And yet at the same time,
it's strangely distinctive.
Unlike his counterparts, who gain
their power through titanium suits
or strange forms of radiation, Thor
is heir to the supernatural realm of
Asgard, a concept lifted by Stan Lee
from Norse mythology. A haughty,
headstrong brat, he's banished to
Earth in the film's first act by his
father, the Norse God Odin (Antho-
ny Hopkins, "Nixon"), stripped of
his power until he learns humility.
Meanwhile, back in Asgard, young-
er brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston,
"Archipelago"), an ambitious trick-
ster with an inferiority complex, is
only too happy to usurp the throne,
plunging the kingdom into chaos.
The bits set in Asgard are the fun,
interesting portions where the film
is at its best. It's here that direc-
tor Kenneth Branagh ("Henry V'),
famous for his past adaptations of
Shakespeare, seems most at home.
In Asgard, situations seem more
consequential. Confrontations seem
more significant and actors' perfor-
mances seem bolder and more dra-
matic. Even the production design
and special effects are more con-
vincingly stunning and fantastical.
But then the script mixes in the
real world, taking magic and placing
it smack dab in the middle of New
Mexico. It could have worked - after
all, it's only awkward if you make
it awkward - but the film makes it
plenty awkward, spending scene
after scene emphasizing how dif-

ferent Thor is from humanity. Thor
complementing a restaurant's coffee
by smashing his mug on the floor.
Thor walking through the streets
and clogging traffic. Thor walking
into a pet store demanding a horse.
These gags are executed repeat-
edly to rapidly decreasing comedic
effect. When worlds inevitably col-
lide as the story reaches its zenith,
the modern world and the many
characters of Asgard clash like hip-
pies and business suits. There's
combat. There are explosions. And
yet we can't really suspend our dis-
belief until our characters return to
Asgard, the only place they seem to
really belong.
We can believe that Hemsworth,
whose claim to fame prior to "Thor"
was the dubious title ofMiley Cyrus's
ex's older brother, is an action hero:
the pounds of muscle he put on for
the movie certainly help, he has a
natural charisma that lends itself
well to cracking heads. Sadly, he's
surrounded by a supporting cast full
of wasted or underutilized talent.
Hopkins, who threw himself into
Hannibal Lecter in "Silence of the
Lambs," owns every second of his
screentime as Odin. Unfortunately,
he doesn't get as many seconds as he
deserves. Recent Oscar-winner Nat-
alie Portman ("Black Swan") gives a
dull, uninspired sideshow of a per-
formance as Thor's obviously-placed
love interest, doing her best with
a role that's little more than a sexy
nerd stereotype. In a way, thesebun-
gled performances are metaphors
for the film itself, a failed experi-
ment with unrealized potential.

Cheap humor and stock characters in 'Bridesmaids'

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
There's nothing funnier than
watching a bunch of girls in
ugly dresses
sabotage each **
other. Except,
that's not what BndeSnlaldS
"Bridesmaids" At Quality 16
is about. and Rave
Annie's
(Kristen Wiig, Universal
"Saturday Night
Live") life is falling apart. Her bak-
ery, originally called Cake Baby,
went out of business. The sign
above the door now reads "Cock
Baby." She lives with an incredibly
odd pair of British twins. Her slam
piece (Jon Hamm, "The Town") is
really kind of an asshole, despite
his dashing good looks. Then, her
best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph,
"Away We Go") asks her to be
maid of honor at her upcoming
wedding. The job turns out to be
much more than Annie bargained
for and threatens to push her life

even further downhill.
The casthastremendous comedic
potential and it's hard not to wonder
if it has been used correctly. For the
most part, the characters just seem
to fill stereotypes. There's the inno-
cent newlywed (Ellie Kemper, TV's
"The Office") as well as the desper-
ate housewife (Wendi McLendon-
Covey, TV's "Reno 911"). At times,
it's difficult to even write them off
as stereotypes because they liter-
ally just stand in the background.
Of course, comedies do tend to use
stock characters like these but at
least the characters are given reign
to fulfill their storyline. In "Brides-
maids," these actresses aren't even
given that opportunity. The one
character who does develop a little
bit, Megan (Melissa McCarthy, TV's
"Gilmore Girls"), seems to be some
kind of a riff off Zach Galifianakis's
character from "The Hangover."
And it's really disturbing. Let's just
say there's some role-playing with
food and leave it at that.
Of course, there are lots of dis-
turbing things. At one point, the

"Bridesmaids" and guys do stuff
like that in his movies all the time
- the only difference is that these
comedians are women. Whether or
not any kind of disgust is the result
of bad taste or some kind of societal
gender inequality remains to be
seen.
That's not to say that everything
in the movie is reduced to vari-
ous versions of a fart joke. There
are actually some genuinely funny
parts. Wiig really shines through at
points, including an airplane scene
where her maneuvers to sneak into
the first-class cabin after downing
some pills and a scotch are actually
quite funny.Atotherpoints,though,
she overdoes it and her antics can
become a little monotonous.
However, at no point does the
movie regress into some kind of
easy-breezy chick flick. OK, it is
a chick flick. But it's a new kind of
chick flick that doesn't rely on a
love story alone. Sadly, what it does
rely on is a subversion the talents
of some honestly funny women in
order to pull of a cheap laugh.

Michigan breezes by Minnesota in series sweep

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team got
out its broom on Sundav after-
noon following a two-game series
sweep over Minnesota at Alumni
Field.
It was MINNESOTA 21
the Wolver- MICHIGAN 4
ines' sixth
conference MINNESOTA 1
sweep of the MICHIGAN 8
season,.
The second-ranked Wolverines
downed the Golden Gophers on
Sunday, 8-1, and on Saturday, 4-2,
led by senior pitcher Jordan Tay-
lor, who manned the mound for
both games of the weekend series.
"You want your kids to come
out and rip the ball every inning,"
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
said after the game on Sunday.
"But in general, we're going to
have to face competition when it
counts (like on Saturday)."
The Wolverines (16-2 Big Ten,
49-4 overall) came out swing-
ing on Sunday, facing Minnesota
pitcher Sara Moulton for the sec-
ond day in a row. But Moulton took
a little too long to get situated,
allowing Michigan to take advan-
tage and put three early runs up
on the board.
After the Golden Gophers load-
ed the bases in the third inning
with no outs, it looked like Min-
nesota (8-10, 30-23) would surely

put some tally marks on the board.
But Taylor made a play at home
and struck out two to allow the
Wolverines to return to the bench
unscathed.
"I thought today we were bet-
ter," Hutchins said. "I just don't
like to see us get complacent. I
thought we got a little complacent
(after the first inning).
"And then it puts the pressure
back on Jordan. All of a sudden
Minnesota had bases loaded with
nobody out."
In the fifth, it was Michigan's
turn to have the bases loaded with
sophomore shortstop Amy Knapp

walking to the plate. Knapp had
been in a slump, hitting inconsis-
tently for a team-low .228.
But she fought off Moulton, foul
ball after foul ball, until she made
contact for a bases-clearing triple
for a seven-run lead.
"I haven't really been consis-
tent lately, but today, coming out
and actually getting hits and put-
ting the ball in play just boosts
my confidence a lot," Knapp said.
"I've had a couple rough weeks,
but today I'm glad to finally break
out of my shell."
After Taylor earned 10 strike-
outs in six innings to help give

Michigan a large lead, sophomore
pitcher Stephanie Speierman
came in. -
Saturday night's matchup was
not as easy for the Wolverines, as
they trailed early by a 2-0 mark.
In the fourth, junior third base-
man Amanda Chidester, who
boasts a season batting average
of .414, hit a hard single up the
middle to send freshman left
fielder Nicole Sappingfield home
for the Wolverines' first run. But
Michigan left the bases loaded as
Moulton ended the inning with
two big outs.
Senior first baseman Dorian

Shaw, who hasn't been at her
best at the plate over the past few
weeks, earned her chance to step
up for the Wolverines in the fifth.
After Sappingfield hit a single
down the right side to send fresh-
man right fielder Lindsay Doyle
home for the tying run, Shaw
stepped up to the plate and hit a
rocket out to the center-field wall
for an RBI double.
"I think it's good to have these
types of situations in our refer-
ence," Shaw said of coming back to
win. "It shows that we're capable
of doing these things and are a
tough team."
A fielding error two batters
later allowed Shaw to. score, giv-
ing Taylor a two-run lead to work
with for the next two innings.
Minnesota threatened to come
back in the top of the seventh after
putting runners on first and sec-
ond, but the Wolverines stayed
consistent in their defense to put
the outs away before any Golden
Gophers reached home.
"When hitters are getting hits
off of Jordan, it's up to us to get
the outs that are available," Shaw
said. "And ... it's just that that lets
her know, 'We're behind you. They
may be hitting you, but they're not
going to score runs.'"
Michigan will play Michigan
State next weekend for a home-
and-home series to close out the
regular season. Friday will serve
as Senior Night in Ann Arbor.

statement.

miles per hour down State Street,
and nearly hit other cars before he
was arrested. As a result, Stonum
could have faced up to 93 days in jail,
$300 in fines and up to 360 hours
of community service. Instead, he
was placed on 12 months probation
among other minor penalties.
Then-coach Rich Rodriguez sus-
pended Stonum for only one game,
for a "violation of team rules."
Earlier this season, Rodriguez
talked about how Stonum had
matured since the incident.
"When a guy messes up and
everyone wants to throw him out
to the wolves ... it's pleasing to fans
and certainly for coaches when you
see a guy grow and mature and he
gets it," Rodriguez said on Sept.

21, 2010, a few days after Stonum
grabbed two touchdowns against
Massachusetts. "You see that matu-
rity kind of kick in. Sometimes they
grow up and they get it. "
Stonum's Michigan career was
supposed to have followed a dif-
ferent trajectory, having entered
the program as the No. 41 overall
player, and a four-star recruit out
of high school, according to Rivals.
com. But Stonum posted modest
numbers during his freshman and
sophomore seasons - failing to
catch 15 passes or more than 200
yards receiving in either year.
But in 2010, as quarterback
Denard Robinson came into his
own on offense, so did a few of the
other receivers, Stonum included.

He finished the year with 49 catches
for 633 yards and four touchdowns.
And he averaged seven catches for
92 yards in three games against the
cream of the crop of the Big Ten, in
Ohio State, Wisconsin and Iowa.
Stonum was expected to be a
member of a deep receiver group,
all returning in2011, featuring red-
shirt junior Roy Roundtree, red-
shirt senior Junior Hemingway and
senior Martavious Odoms.
Hoke did leave room for Stonum
to return at some point during the
Stafford, Texas native's senior year.
"If he fulfills all of the commit-
ments he has to the legal system
and our program, we will make a
determination regarding his return
to the team," Hoke added.

What does Darius Morris's departure mean for Michigan?

or Michigan fans, the end-
ing to the 2010-11 men's bas-
ketball campaign was the
definition of bittersweet.
Minutes after Darius Morris
missed the
game-tying
shot in the final
seconds of the
tournament
matchup with
Duke, the then-
sophomore
point guard LUKE
walked back PASCH
onto the court
to relive the
moment. He used an invisible
ball to re-enact the floater that he
missed - the same floater that he
sunk nine times out of 10 during
the regular season.
Wolverine fans who hadn't yet
emptied out of Time Warner Cable
Arena watched on, not knowing
how to react. Such a narrow loss to
the top-seeded Blue Devils stung,
and watching Morris cling to that
moment made it harder to forget.
But the future was bright - so
bright that it seemed as though
Morris was practicing that shot for
next year.
There's always next season, right?
There wasn't a single fourth-
year player on the team, after all,
and Morris would be back with
a chip on his shoulder. Incoming
freshman guard Trey Burke, wide-
ly regarded as the top player in
Ohio, would back up Morris. And
that meant Stu Douglass would
finally be able to stick to his natu-

ral shooting guard position for his
senior year.
Jon Horford would nurse his
knee this offseason and develop
into a viable back-up for Jordan
Morgan at center, which meant
that the relatively undersized
Evan Smotrycz could revert to his
natural position at forward. There
would be no more Jared Sullinger-
Smotrycz mismatches in the post.
Tim Hardaway Jr. would work
on his ball-handling. Morgan
would work on avoiding fouls.
Matt Vogrich would try to grow a
few inches. And Morris would lead
the charge to the 2012 NCAA Final
Four in New Orleans.
Well, as we now know, that
probably wasn't what Morris was
thinking when he took the court
again after that heartbreaking
loss against Duke. As he relived
those final seconds, maybe he was
wondering if that was his last shot
in a Michigan uniform. Maybe he
needed closure because he knew
he wouldn't get that shot again.
Maybe Morris knew then that
he'd never make it to the Final
Four.
On Wednesday, he made it offi-
cial - he's keeping his name in
the 2011 NBA Draft to fulfill his
life-long dream of playing at the
professional level. And in all hon-
esty, Darius Morris made the best
decision for Darius Morris.
It's easy to say that another year
with the Wolverines would have
improved his draft stock, but it's
a lot harder to actually come back
and perform better than 15 points

and 6.7 assists per game (his soph-
omore-year numbers).
Morris was simply selling him-
self high, and he'll likely be picked
in the first round because of it.
But it was more personal for
Michigan fans who, on Wednes-
day, said goodbye to the 2011-12
season that could have been.
Although Morris's announcement
was not apocalyptic, there's no
doubt it was a significant blow to
the team's postseason expecta-
tions. Michigan still has talent, but
last season, the Wolverines were
only as good as their floor general.
My look into the crystal ball
has next year's squad making it
back to the NCAA Tournament.
But after Morris's announcement,
Michigan dropped from Final
Four potential to an early-round
exit. Burke will probably earn
the starting job at point guard,
having to fill in some very large
shoes. And although there's no
doubt that the Columbus-native
has talent (he averaged 24 points
and seven assists in his senior sea-
son), it's hard to rely on a fresh-
man running the point in such
a guard-heavy offense. Just ask
Morris how his rookie year went,
when he averaged 4.4 points per
game while starting much of the
2009-10 season.
If you're searching for a real sil-
ver lining from the announcement,
you have to look past next season.
You have to look at the coaching
staff that built a mediocre point
guard into one of the top playmak-
ers in the nation. And you have to

Sophomore guard Darius Morris announced this week that he would remain in the
NBA Draft, where he is projected to be a first-round pick.

look at the high school stars that
raised their eyebrows when Mor-
ris made his decision official.
As much as we'd like to think
that players come to Michigan for
the school's tradition and winning
attitude, the top recruits want to
play at programs that will help
them become NBA-ready. And
on Wednesday, Beilein became a
coach that does just that - after
two seasons inAnn Arbor, Morris
may become the program's first
first-round draft pick since Jamal
Crawford was taken eighth overall
11 years ago.
Maybe that's why the Wolver-

Ines' roster features three sons
of former NBA players - and a
fourth committed for two seasons
from now in Glenn Robinson III.
Maybe their fathers genuinely
believed that Beilein could turn
their boys into men - the same
kind of men they became in their
college years.
So, maybe Michigan effectively
traded next year's expectations
for long-term recruiting success,
and it maytake time for usto see
if it actually pans out. But for now,
fans can only hope that eventually,
the sweetness will outweigh the
bitterness.

DPS OVERSIGHT
From Page 1
Though Borisov was acquit-
ted on criminal charges connect-
ed to the event, he went on to file
a grievance against DPS, which
led to Friday's release of a public
report.
The committee's report found
that the "conduct of the officers
was inappropriate" because the
officers were asked to go beyond
their usual duties and act in ways
that were not covered under DPS
authority. This included the offi-
cers' supervision of Borisov as
he resigned and cleaned out his
office, adding that the department
chair should have supervised both
of acts.
The report examines the man-
agement of situations like Bor-
isov's by DPS by suggesting that
officers not be in the room during
such meetings. The report claims
they should only serve as "civil
standby," and stay directly outside
the room to diminish any intimi-
dation their presence may cause.
Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and chief
financial officer, wrote in a May 6
press release that no disciplinary
actions will be enacted against the
DPS officers. He added that the
report helps to better define the
role DPS should have on campus.
"I appreciate the efforts, ener-
gy and thoughtful work by the
committee on the complaint from
Dr. Borisov," Slottow wrote. "I am
pleased that the committee did not
recommend disciplinary measures
be taken against the DPS officers."
"As I told the committee when

equipment," Hu said.
Jeff Mason, executive director
of the URC, said the funds were
awarded to the URC with the
hope of increasing the amount of
joint research between the three
universities, and in turn leading
to increased research funding for
the state.
"(Funding) is going to create
more collaboration with faculty
from across the three campuses
and in doing so will create more
successful and competitive pro-
posals that potentially could lead
to more funding from the National
Institute of Health and other fed-
eral sources that will bring dollars
into the state."

we met, I strive to create a culture
where we continuously improve,"
he added. "The comments and
recommendations the committee
provided will serve as a founda-
tion to help us successfully craft
and implement the necessary
changes."
The report also suggested
that if DPS is called, a University
human resource representative
should be requested to advise the
departing employee in a situation
like Borisov's. Borisov claims that
on Sept. 4, 2008, he repeatedly
asked about the consequences of
resignation versus termination,
but received no advice from any-
one present in the room.
An April 22 press release from
the University regarding the Bor-
isov incident states that such pol-
icy changes are necessary because
they will help prevent similar inci-
dents from occurring.
"The University acknowledges
that more fully articulated proce-
dures and expectations may have
led to a more positive outcome
for all parties," the release stated.
"The University regrets any incor-
rect information published about
these events that harmed Dr. Bor-
isov's reputation."
Sarah Prescott, a lawyer work-
ing on Borisov's case, said she
received a final report on March
17, but that it differed from the
version released to the public on
Friday.
Prescott said she received
an e-mail from Law School Prof.
Richard Friedman, a faculty mem-
ber of the DPS Oversight Commit-
tee, with the March 17 version of
the report, saying that the Com-
mittee was planning on publically

releasing the report on March 24
unless there was a reason it would
be inappropriate to do so.
Although Prescott didn't con-
test the report's public release, it
was not made public until last Fri-
day after a series of meetings with-
in the University where members
of the DPS Oversight Committee
further discussed their concerns
and edited the report.
Prescott said she thought
these changes were made to lessen
the blow to the University's image.
She added that one discrepancy
from the March 17 report was that
is states there was a University
human resources representative
present at the meeting with Bor-
isov to address his confusion about
the difference between resigna-
tion and termination.
Prescott said the changes that
were made from the final report
she saw and the one released
on Friday "were pretty telling"
because the removed remarks por-
trayed the University negatively.
"It's absolutely ridiculous
for a committee to issue a report
to the parties involved and then
one party decides it'd like to keep
working on changes to that item
until they apparently approved
it, and only then does the second
report - modified - get released
as, quote-unquote, the final
report," Prescott said.
Prescott added that Borisov
sued the University in a civil law-
suit regarding the incident that
was filed with Washtenaw Circuit
Court in 2009.
"I think (the settlement ver-
sus a trial) says a whole, whole
lot about what they saw, in terms
of their exposure for the way that

(the University) behaved," she
said. "The University settled with
Dr. Borisov and paid him a signifi-
cant amount of money."
Along with the settlement, the
University released a public apol-
ogy on April 22 and Borisov was
also made eligible for rehire at the
University.
Prescott said that she believes
the officers should have received
some form of punishment for their
behavior.
"He is a professional who had
served this University as of that
moment and brought millions and
millions of dollars of grant money
into the University," she said. "For
them to treat him like they did -
like a trespasser, someone who
has broken in, in the middle of the
night - is absolutely ridiculous."
Prescott added that she thinks
the incident has negatively affect-
ed both Borisov's and the Univer-
sity's image.
"One way or another, the fact
of the matter is these officers con-
tributed to a situation where a
person was prosecuted wrongly,"
she said. "...They led to a situation
where the University has now had
to pay out hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of dollars in legal
fees and money to Dr. Borisov."
Richard Friedman, law profes-
sor and faculty member of the DPS
Oversight Committee, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the report
was written to deal with the prob-
lems that DPS faced in Borisov's
case and to prevent them from
occurring again.
"I think the report covers
everything it should," Friedman
said. "We were not concerned with
the causes of Dr. Borisov's separa-

tion from the department of pedi-
atrics. Our concern is with DPS.
In this case, a significant part of
the problem was that DPS officers
were put in a position to perform
functions that were not appropri-
ate for them."
Rebecca Egler, a student
member of the DPS Oversight
Committee, said the report com-
prehensively covers the essential
information about the case.
"The process of writing the
Borisov report was long and pre-
cise, which I think is clear in the
final product," Egler said. "It was
a good, democratic experience for
the committee and we did our best
to deliver a thorough and thought-
ful end product, which is hopeful-
ly evident in the report itself."
The report comes about a year
after the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affair's Fac-
ulty Hearing Committee filed a
55-page report stating that Univer-
sity officials had violated Borisov's
"rights and academic freedom" by
forcing him to resign, according
to a May 23, 2010, article in The
Michigan Daily.
The article also said that the
SACUA report explained how
Borisov's resignation "broke
established University policies
surrounding academic integrity,
wrongfully damaged Borisov's
reputation and retaliated against
him."
SACUA Chair Kate Barald
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the suggestions made in the report
should help to prevent a situa-
tion like Borisov's from happen-
ing again, adding that SACUA is
unable to comment further until
they deliberate over the report.
