Core team of
employees support
survivors of
sexual assault
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
For 168 consecutive hours at
a time, a full week, Anne Huh-
man doesn't let a 2005 black flip
phone out of her sight. Huh-

man is the program manager
for education and prevention at
the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness
Center, and one of only five
people who currently handle
the crisis hotline.
Huhman and three oth-
ers serve as advocates in the
SAPAC office, where survivors
of trauma can receive support,
counseling and resources for
various issues. SAPAC staff
also educate students about
sexual assault to create a cam-

pus environment focused on
prevention.
The center was founded in
1986 after University students
protested the lack of a rape cri-
sis center on campus.
Huhman became an advo-
cate for survivors of sexual or
domestic violence, which cul-
minated in her employment at
SAPAC.
After jgraduating from the
University of Wisconsin in
2002, Huhman took a job at
Underground Railroad, Inc.,

a domestic violence shelter
in Saginaw, Mich. There, she
worked with schools and juve-
nile detention centers and
gained experience educating
youth about sexual assault and
harassment, dating violence,
stalking and healthy relation-
ships, while working with sur-
vivors.
In 2004, Huhman entered
the University's School of Social
Work and began her work at
SAPAC for her field placement.

Though a crash left its car
damaged in the Australian Out-

Solar Car Team is already mak-

On Monday, the team
announced its intention to com-

1,700-mile race from Austin,
Texas to St. Paul, Minn.
But after the damage sus-

Eight days before the fall
semester's Central Student Gov-

met for their 10th meeting Tues-

day night.
CSG discussed two reso-

For The Daily
Starting at 8 a.m on Saturday,
University students and mem-
bers of the Ann Arbor com-
munity will have the chance to
volunteer for 24 consecutive
hours.

Thisyear, the annual 24-hour
Service Day hosted by the Uni-
versity's chapter of Circle K - a
student organization that pro-
motes community service and
leadership - will provide 108
service opportunities. Projects
will take place in a variety of
locations and range from ran-
dom acts of kindness to planting
trees in Detroit.
Approximately 50 student
organizations have signed up
to participate so far and will
be joined by local nonprofits

and businesses such as Michi-
gan Abilities Center and Tantr6
Farm, an organic farm located
in Chelsea, Mich.
LSA senior Alex Novo, Circle
K's external vice president, said
the broad range of volunteering
opportunities is meant to appeal
to a large group of people with
varying interests.

Yale student group cam-
paigns against divestment
As Yale University prepares
for a Nov. 17 referendum regard-
ing the university's policyon
fossil-fuel investment, a new
student group is arguing against
potential divestment measures,
The Yale Daily News reported
Tuesday.
Despite the heavy support
for divestment on campus, the
Students for a Strong Endow-

ment argues that the proposed
measures could seta danger-
ous precedent for university
finances.
While the group agrees with
the environmental principles
behind divestment efforts,
founder Alex Fischer argues that
the Yale's long-term financial
viability shouldn't be put at risk
in order to argue a political mes-
sage.
The group, which currently
has 15 to 20 members, formally
submitted a statement against
the divestment efforts on
Friday.

I et from the ashes of ground
Thtose aspirations of global
supretnacy fell by the wayside
iong ago, but New York won
- consolation prize 'Tuesday
lihen an international architec-
tural panel said it would recog-
rize (ne World trade Center
the tallest skyseraper in the
U tited States.
h'le Counicil on 'alt iBuildings
and Urban abitat, considered
 world authority on super-
id skyscrapers, annunxced
decision at simultaneous
rews conferences in New York
Ind Ch icago, hIonie to the 1,451-

foot Willis 'Tower, which
is being dethroned as the
nation's tallest building.
Measuring the height of a
building would seem to be a
simple thing, but in the case of
the new World Trade Center
tower it is complicated by the
408-foot-tall needle atop the
skyscraper's roof.
The council's verdict rested
oil a cttrclusion that the needle
should be counted as part of the
tuilding's total height. Without
it, the tower would be just 1,368
feet tall, the same height as the
original World 'Trade Center.
That would make it smaller than
not only the Willis, but also a
1,397-foot apartment building
being built a short subway ride
away near Central Park.
Speaking at his office in New
York, council chairman Timo-
thy Johnson, an architect at the
global design firm NBBJ, said
the decision by the 25-member
height committee had more.

"tense moments" than usual,
given the skyscraper's impor-
tance as a patriotic symbol.
"I was here on 9/11. t saw the
buildings come down," he said.
over the past few months,
the council had hinted that it
might be open to changing its
standards for measuring ultra-
tall buildings, given a trend
toward developers adding
"vanity height" to towers with
huge, decorative spires.
But the council also has a
history of disallowing anten-
nas in height calculations. The
Empire State Building's land-
mark 204-foot needle isn't
counted in its height measure-
ment. Neither are the two TV
antennas atop the Willis Tower,
which had been the country's
tallest building since it was
completed - and named the
Sears Tower - in 1974.
But in the end, there was una-
nimity on the committee that
One World Trade Center's reach
for 1,776 feet - a number that
echoes the founding year of the
United States - was an artistic
architectural expression.
"This was a quest to put
something meaningful and
symbolic on that site because
of the horrible history of what
happened on that site," said
Antony Wood, the council's
executive director.
Tourists photographing the
skyscraper Tuesday mostly
agreed that when it comes to
height measurements, this
spire should count.
"For any other building, no.
But for this one, yes," said Cary
Bass, of Lake Mary, Fla., as he
waited to enter the National
Sept. I1 Memorial at the new
skyscraper's feet. "Those peo-
ple deserve it," he said, refer-
ring to the attack victims.
"It's a special building," said
Paul Schlagel, visiting from
Longmont, Colo.

kind won a public design compe-
tition for the World Trade Center

Netanyahu asks
housing minister
to "reconsider"
constrution aims
JERUSALEM (AP) - Isra-
el's prime minister on Tues-
day abruptly halted a plan to
explore the potential construc-
tion of thousands of new homes
in West Bank settlements, say-
ing it had created an "unneces-
sary confrontation" with the
international community that
threatened to weaken his cam-
paign against Iran's suspect
nuclear program.
The plan announced by Isra-
el's Housing Ministry earlier
in the day had prompted a Pal-
estinian threat to walk out of
U.S.-brokered peace talks and
drew angry criticism from offi-
cials in Washington, who said
they had been blindsided by the
move.
In a statement, Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he had asked his housing min-
ister, Uri Ariel, to "reconsider"
the plan. He noted that Ariel,
a member of the pro-settle-
ment Jewish Home Party, had
drawn up the plan "without any
advance coordination."
"This step does not contrib-
ute to settlement. On the con-
trary, there is damage here for
settlement," Netanyahu said.
"This is a meaningless step -
legally and in practice - and an
action that creates an unnec-
essary confrontation with the
international community at a
time when we are making an
effort to persuade elements in
the international community to
reach a better deal with Iran."
The statement said Ariel had
accepted the request.
The issue of settlement con-
struction has been at the heart
of a standstill in peace efforts
in recent years.
The Palestinians claim the
West Bank, east Jerusalem and
the Gaza Strip, territories cap-
. .

tured by Israel in 1967, for an
independent state. They say
Israeli settlement construction
on occupied lands is a sign of
bad faith. More than 500,000
Israelis now live in the West
Bank and east Jerusalem. Israel
withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
The ministry refused to say
how many of these homes were
in settlements. But the anti-set-
tlement watchdog group Peace
Now, which closely monitors
construction activity, said the
plans included nearly 20,000
apartments in the West Bank
and 4,000 in east Jerusalem.
In all, Peace Now says
Netanyahu's government has
given final approval for nearly
3,500 new homes in Jewish set-
tlements since taking office last
March. In addition, it has pro-
moted plans for nearly 9,000
additional homes.
The international communi-
ty rejects settlements as illegal
or illegitimate, and the reaction
to Israel's plan was swift.
The chief Palestinian nego-
tiator, Saeb Erekat, said that at
the instruction of his president,
he had contacted the U.S., Rus-
sia, the European Union, the
United Nations and the Arab
League to voice objections.
"I informed them that if
Israel implements this deci-
sion, then this means the end of
the negotiations and the end of
the peace process," Erekat said.
In Washington, State
Department spokeswoman Jen
Psaki said the White House
had been caught off guard and
demanded "further explana-
tion" from Israel.
"Our position on settle-
ments is quite clear - we do
not accept the legitimacy of
continued settlement activity.
We've called on both sides to
take steps to create a positive
atmosphere for the negotia-
tions," she added.
Peace talks resumed in late
July after a nearly five-year
break. The sides have set an
April target date for reaching
an agreement.

Under heavy U.S. pressure,
the Palestinians dropped a
longstanding demand for a
halt in settlement construc-
tion. To lure the Palestinians
back to the table, Israel agreed
to release 104 of the longest-
serving Palestinian prisoners,
all convicted in violent attacks
on Israelis, in four phases.
The Palestinians also say they
received assurances that set-
tlement construction would be
constrained.
Both sides have said the
negotiations have made no
progress. The situation dete-
riorated further two weeks
ago when Israel, responding to
its release of a second batch of
prisoners, announced plans to
build thousands of new homes
in the West Bank and east Jeru-
salem. Those plans remain on
track.
In an interview broadcast on
Israeli and Palestinian TV last
week, U.S. Secretary of State
John Kerry said continued
settlement construction raised
questions about Israel's seri-
ousness about pursuing peace.
Erekat, the Palestinian nego-
tiator, said there have been no
negotiations for the past week.
Israeli officials had unsuc-
cessfully tried to play down
Tuesday's announcement. They
said the government was merely
beginning a long-term feasibil-
ity study and no new construc-
tion had been approved. Any
construction that does take
place, they added, would be
years away.
The Housing Ministry said
it had published bids seeking
architectural firms to look
into possible construction of
some 600,000 homes nation-
wide to ease a chronic housing
crunch.
In recent days, Netanyahu
has feuded with the U.S., his
closest and most important
ally, over the troubled Mideast
peace efforts and attempts by
the international community
to curb Iran's nuclear pro-
gram.

U.S. doctors
1 urge wider use of
cholesterol drugs
The nation's first new guide-
lines in a decade for preventing
heart attacks and strokes call
for twice as many Americans -
one-third of all adults - to con-
sider taking cholesterol-lowering
statin drugs.
The guidelines, issued Tues-
day by the American Heart Asso-
ciation and American College
of Cardiology, are a big change.
They offer doctors a new formula
for estimating a patient's risk that
includes many factors besides a
high cholesterol level, the main
focus now. The formula includes
age, gender, race and factors such
as whether someone smokes.
The guidelines for the first

time take aim at strokes, not just
heart attacks. Partly because of
that, they set alower threshold for
using medicines to reduce risk.

ter what they need or when they

for advocates to get phone calls at
3 a.m. while they're on shift.
"If the phone rings, we drop

ensure we give attention to who-
ever is on the line," Huhman
said. "It could be a survivor or
a friend or a family member, or
really anyone inthe community."
Advocate Heather Colohan,
SAPAC's program manager for
community outreach and sys-
tems advocacy, said advocacy
work is especially relevant on
college campuses.
Colohan described a recent
call from a student who was
concerned for her friend, who
had been drinking. The friend
was in a room alone with a male
student, and the caller was con-
cerned that she would be asked
to engage in sexual activity. If
the friend was intoxicated, she
may have been incapable of giv-
ing consent.
Colohan talked the caller
through the situation, instructing
her to distract the perpetrator by
askingoneofhisfriendstocallhim
from the roomto do him a favorso
that the caller could remove her
friend from the situation.
"It felt really good to have my
training and my education about
prevention come to fruition,"
Colohan said. "You know that
what we're trying to spread is
not falling on deaf ears."

Hawaii Senate passes
gay marriage bill

Governer anticipates
signing bill, which
was passed 19-4
HONOLULU (AP) - The state
Senate passed a bill Tuesday
legalizing gay marriage, putting
Hawaii a signature away from
becoming a same-sex wedding
destination.
Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who
called lawmakers to a special
session for the bill and has vocal-
ly supported gay marriage, said
in a statement he will sign the
measure. It will allow thousands
of gay couples living in Hawaii
and even more tourists to marry
in the state starting Dec. 2.
"I look forward to signing this
significant piece of legislation,
which provides marriage equity
and fully recognizes and pro-
tects religious freedoms," Aber-
crombie said.
President Barack Obama
praised the bill's passage, say-
ing the affirmation of freedom
and equality makes the country
stronger.

"I've always been proud to
have been born in Hawaii, and
today's vote makes me even
prouder," Obama said.
Senators passed the bill 19-4
with two lawmakers excused.
Cheers erupted inside and out-
side the gallery when the vote
was taken, with a smattering of
boos. Senate President Donna
Mercado Kim, who voted against
the bill, banged her gavel and
told members of the public to
quiet down.
More than half the chamber's
lawmakers spoke in support of
the bill, with many urging the
public to come together to heal
divisions within the community.
"This is nothing more than the
expansion of aloha in Hawaii,"
said Sen. J. Kalani English, a
Democrat from Maui.
Sen. Sam Slom, the chamber's
only Republican, said the gov-
ernment should stay out of legis-
lating marriage.
"People have differences, and
you can't legislate morality. You
can try, but you can't do it," Slom
said before voting against the
bill.

groups who said their election
undermined the rights watch-
dog's credibility.
The General Assembly
elected 14 new members to the
47-seat Geneva-based council,
which can shine a spotlight on
rights abuses by adopting reso-
lutions - when it chooses to do
so. It also has dozens of spe-
cial monitors watching prob-

lem countries and major issues
ranging from executions to
drone strikes.
Britain, France, the Mal-
dives, Macedonia, Mexico,
Morocco, Namibia and South
Africa were also elected to
three-year terms.
Human Rights Watch noted
that five of the new council
members - China, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and
Algeria - have refused to let
U.N. investigators visit to check
alleged abuses. China, Russia
and Algeria have 10 or more
unfulfilled requests for visits by
U.N. experts, some dating back
to 2000, the group said. Saudi
Arabia and Vietnam each have
seven outstanding requests,
they said.
"Countries that haven't
allowed U.N. experts appoint-
ed by the council to visit have

a lot of explaining to do," said
Peggy Hicks, global advocacy
director of the New York-based
non-government group. "It's

Across the street from the

huge banner saying "China Fails

Seats, allotted by region,
are sometimes contested
and sometimes not. All 193
members of the General

practices, denounced what it
considered the worst new mem-
bers.

Taking a stand on trafficking
State's efforts to end the human rights violation warrant support
n Nov. 6, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, alongside an
appointed panel of state lawmakers, released the final report from
the Michigan Commission on Human Trafficking. The 63-page
report provides recommendations for programs that aim to target criminals
'engaged in the illegal enterprise of human trafficking, as well as assisting
+victims, which arise from the practice. Due to the increasing prevalence of
-the issue in Michigan, advocates against human trafficking have correctly
focused their efforts on increasing cooperation within the state by calling for
uniformity and awareness of the issue.

In late September, members of the Michi-
gan Senate introduced 18 new bills to address
'human trafficking. Due tp concern across the
state, the proposed legislation seeks to address
the frailties of human traffickinglaws. Primar-
ily, the bills advocate for increased support and
services for victims, but also urge for stronger
prosecution against traffickers. The recom-
mendations provided in the report specifically
point to the necessity of targetingthe earnings
'of criminals - including targeting their prop-
erties and assets.
One issue in combating human traffick-
ing for legislators and activists alike has been
quantification. While Schuette has estimated
the victims each yearto range from "thousands,
;'maybe a couple thousands," programs around
-the state have reported fewer than 300 cases
yearly. While advocates for human trafficking
reform may seem to be overstating the vastness
of incidents, the numbers behind the reports
,are more complicated. However, in many cases,
-the numbers for trafficking offenses are signifi-
cantly reduced due to cases being misidentified
as prostitution or other related crimes. In order
"to classify the cases appropriately, the Com-
'mission's report has recommended the imple-
"-mentation of additional training and a uniform
system to improve data collection - a neces-
sary step to take further action.
Perhaps to the surprise of many, the Com-
MEGAN MCDONALD I

mission reports that the problem in Michigan
"is serious and growing." So while the need for
training specific to human trafficking is evi-
dent, greater public awareness on the issue
is crucial. An increased public awareness of
trafficking will lead to a more comprehensive
understanding of the crime and the victims
associated with trafficking - which includes
prostitution, as well as forced labor. In many
cases, minors have been unjustly treated as
criminals, adding further harm to their mis-
fortunes. While many residents of Michigan
are aware that human trafficking is an issue,
it does not always resonate as proximate.
With greater public understanding, these
criminals won't be able to operate as dis-
creetly as they have in the past.
The Commission's report has begun a
more concerted effort by the state to address
human trafficking. While the report will cer-
tainly play a major role in illuminating human
trafficking as an issue within Michigan, the
implementation of the recommendations
will ultimately decide its success. Through
statewide coordination, it should be expected
that law enforcement and associated service
employees will actively pursue the proper
treatment of victims of human trafficking.
By separating the victims from the criminals,
the issue at hand will become more tangible'
and efficiently combated.

Until recently, I never con-
sidered myself a roman-
tic person. In fact, I was
practically born
jaded when it
came to court-
ship. From a
young age, I
prided myself

girlish fanta- _
sies and acts of
mushy devo-
tion. I rolled my eyes at rom-coms.
I pretended to forget anniversa-
ries so I wouldn't have to celebrate
them. Once, a stranger told me,
"You're beautiful; I want to paint
you." I laughed in his face. Even my
first Internet presence was anti-
romantic - when I was a smart-
assed tween, the personal summary
on my MySpace page simply read, "I
enjoy long walks on the beach, can-
dIe-lit dinners ... and SARCASM."
Of course, I was so opposed to
"romance" because my definition
was pretty lame. When I thought
of the word, I pictured stupidly
expensive dinners in poorly lit res-
taurants, girls quaking over boxes
of coconut-filled chocolate and
women draped honeymoon-style
across the arms of men in suits.
None of that sounded like me.
For one thing, these images were
all boring and very uncool. Tradi-

ist for all parties involved. My defi-
nition hinged on dudes doing all the

could be demeaning for women and
exhausting for men.

Living in racial limbo

- Emily Pittinos can be reached
at pittinos@umich.edu.

Recently, there have been many pieces
published reflecting the struggles of different
minority groups on campus, and the response
has been amazing. But, I'd like to argue that
despite all this talk about race, we've forgot-
ten one minority - my minority. Being bi-
racial.
I am White. I was born in the suburbs of
Detroit and have spent my whole life there.
English is my first language and Ican attempt
- to speak Spanish only because I'm in my
fourth semester requirement. I share the same
'cultural views about the world as many other
Americans, and I do have German, Irish, and
'English heritage, which I'm very proud of.
I am Asian - half Filipina, specifically -
but I don't share the same cultural views and
j'experiences as my mom. While I love tradi-
tional Filipino foods and learning about my
'-mom's lifestyle in her village, I've never been
-to the Philippines. I talk to distant relatives in
the Philippines who have known much more
pain than I ever will. I can't speak Tagalog,
but I can tell you that "mahal kita" means I
love you, and I know a couple of swear words
as well.
I am two races, two ethnicities - a com-
bination of two different worlds. Those two
worlds have conflicted on many occasions
and forced me to pick and choose my beliefs,
but ultimately made me who I am. I am proud
of my heritage, just as any other American
would boast about their heritage, whether
that's Irish, Chinese, Nigerian or Mexican.
But when it comes to race, I'm stuck in racial
limbo. I'm both, but neither at the same time.
In conversations about race, bi-racial iden-

titlies are forgotten. We are the true minority.
Only 2.4 percent of Americans are bi-racial.
But we're clumped into other minority iden-
tities, which doesn't allow us to fully express
the experiences we've had. Half white, half
Black. Half White, half Asian. Half Asian,
half Black. Whatever combination, we're left
as outcasts, never fully fitting within either
group and only grouped by what others per-
ceive us as.
The bi-racial struggle is trying to fit in. We
can label ourselves as Asian, Black, Latino,
etc., but at the end of the day, those groups
always recognize our White heritage. The
same goes for tryingto identify as White - it's
impossible because we can't be fully accepted
due to our minority background. But I can't
simply leave one to adopt the other. My dad
had an impact on my life, as did my mom.
Would I be doing an injustice to my upbring-
ing by rejecting my White identity, or even
worse, seem as if I didn'tvalue my dad?And as
for my mom, with all her love and tenderness,
would I inadvertently reject her and her cul-
ture by abandoning my Filipino background?
I refuse to subscribe to just one race. Being
bi-racial is a part of me and a part of my story.
In a society where we've divided ourselves
upon race, bi-racial people like me are the
ones who know what it means to be a minority
and feel rejection. However, we're pioneers
in the sense because we see both sides for all
its beauty and its flaws, and create the bridge
between the two.

when I tell the story of how my
brother fought for his life - and
ultimately, won - people don't
always understand that I'm haunt-
ed. To my friends who know the
story, it should be something I can
let go of - I mean, he's healthy
now, right? But the perspective I
have on the world and the life I lead
will forever be informed by the two
months that my only sibling spent
in the hospital.
In a face-off with death, he won.
He's lucky. And that makes me
lucky, because I still have my broth-
er here. But what most people don't
realize is that this brush with death
has left me with a forever-anxiety.
Uncertainty breathes down my
neck, and I worry about his health
all the time.
When my brother was a senior in
high school, he contracted a staph
infection that ultimately infected
his heart. Standing at the water-
shed moment of childhood and
adulthood, my 18-year-old broth-
er required open-heart surgery.
Before the infection, he was a very
healthy young man, rarely miss-
ing a day of school. But there's an
aspect of randomness to illnesses
that most people don't realize until
they become its victims.
Nearly six years out from his
surgery, my brother is now a gradu-
ate of the University and plans to
become a lawyer. Though he will
require medical attention and prob-
ably another heart surgery later on,
he's healthy.
For nearly a year following

his release from the hospital, I
watched my father file paperwork
and negotiate with our health care
provider. Though working through
the bureaucracy of health insur-
ance was aggravating and chal-
lenging, my brother would not be
alive without it.
For me, the debate surrounding
the Affordable Care Act is person-
al. Before this legislation, medical
insurance providers often avoided
insuring people who had illnesses
that likely required future treat-
ment. Ironically, this meant that
those who needed healthcare cov-
erage the most were denied so that
insurance companies could guar-
antee their own profits. If not for
the passing of this act, my brother's
pre-existing condition would have
made it virtually impossible for
him to procure health insurance
as an adult. Under the Affordable
Care Act, my brother is insured on
my parents' plan for another three
years, and he won't be denied cov-
erage because of his surgery.
I believe that health care is a
basic human right, and it has taken
our country too long to get to the
place we are today. My brother's
health hangs in the balance of this
new legislation. His story may not
be extraordinary, but were his cir-
cumstances different, it would have
had another ending. If, for example,
my parents worked for companies
that didn't have health insurance.
Or if my brother, as a law school
student, got sick again after he was
no longer covered by my parents'

insurance and had chosen - like
most young adults - not to buy
health insurance.
Without health insurance, my 0
brother would have been left vul-
nerable to more than his own ill-
ness. He would have risked his
own financial security. In fact,
according to NerdWallet Health,
nearly two million people will file

Upon hearing of my brother's
recovery, one religious leader in
my high school told me he had
been lucky, and thank goodness
so many people had been praying
for his welfare, for surely God had
played a heavy hand in the outcome

an aspect of luck - both good and
bad - to my brother's illness. But
he also had a team of highly skilled,
fast-acting doctors and the ability
to pay for medical costs on his side.

'Barber of Seville'
the original sitcom

No new EDM'Friends'

School of Music,
Theatre & Dance
puts on famed opera
By REBECCA GODWYN
Daily Arts Writer
When given the choice between
watching an opera and a sitcom,
most people would choose the sit-
com. But accord-
ing to Associate The Barber
Professor and
Opera Director of Seville
in the School of Thursday at
Music, Theatre 7:30 p.m.,Friday
& Dance, Rob- and Saturday
ert Swedberg, at8p.m.and
the upcoming Sunday at2 p.m.
production of '
"The Barber of Power Center
Seville" by Gio- Fram$22
acchino Ros-
sini and Cesare
Sterbini, which Swedberg is
directing, is quite similar to a pop-
ular TV comedy.
"The story itself is characters
that are based on the 'commedia
dell'arte' background from the
Italian comedies," Swedberg said.
"But you may relate to how they
are used in sitcoms, kind of like
'Seindfeld.'"
The show details the story of
Count Almaviva as he falls in love
with Rosina, the pretty and young
ward of the elderly Dr. Bartolo.
However, there is a hitch in the
Count's plan when it is discovered
the doctor intends to marry Rosi-
na himself. The count enlists the
help of Figaro and what follows is
a hilarious story of deception and
confusion. Despite the opera being
over 200 years old, Swedberg
explained how parallels could be
drawn between the cast of charac-
ters and popular modern comedic

characters.
"Imagine that Jerry Seinfeld is
a character like Figaro: He's smart,
he's cunning, he's got the brilliant
ideas. Then, the Dr. Bartolo char-
acter is similar to George Costan-
za, often angry, often bizarre in his
own individual way," Swedberg
explained. "And then this Rosi-
na character is pretty similar to
Elaine, so we know these charac-
ters from sitcoms."
The show has been translated
into English for past performanc-
es, but this particular performance
will be performed in the original
Italian. "The reason we perform in
Italian is because that is the origi-
nal language of the piece, and it's
actually a more beautiful language
to sing in," Swedberg said.
However, to make the show
more accessible to a wider audi-
ence, the English translations will
be projected over the stage so the
audience can follow along withthe
show. Several other touches have
been added as well to make the
show feel more modern.
"You'll see in the set design and
the costumes, there are some ele-
ments that are more contempo-
rary," Swedberg said.
One example of an added con-
temporary element that can be
seen is the implementation of a
QR code, the square symbol that
can be scanned by smartphones
to bring you to a link, for Rossini
made into tiles around the edge of
the set.
Swedberg said fans of the opera
will have the opportunity to watch
the show performed with two
separate casts, which is common
in the opera program because
the MT&D wants to give as many
students as possible an opportu-
nity to perform these roles. While
the idea of sharing a role may be
strange to some, the actors are

strongly encouraged to come up
with unique characterizations for
their own individual part instead
of working collaboratively.
"Early in the rehearsal process,
when we lay out the staging, both
actors in a role get the same stag-
ing, but they're encouraged to
develop their own characteriza-
tions," Swedberg explained. "And
sometimes we'll discover a bit that
one cast will do, and we'll share it
with the other cast if it is some-
thing we want to incorporate into
the production itself."
If opera doesn't interest you
much, perhaps the athleticism of
the performers will draw you in.
The full show is to be performed
with an acoustic orchestra and
none of the performers will have
microphones, meaning they will
use the power of their voices alone
to fill the Power Center.
"This is really hard stuff to sing.
So you can be really impressed by
the singing as an athletic event,"
Swedberg said.
It is well known that there is
a strong stereotype about opera
that claims it is only for the elite
rather than the masses, but Swed-
berg hopes this doesn't deter peo-
ple from coming to the show.
"I think that people often
don't understand that they're
going to have a good time at an
opera," Swedberg said. "There
are so many stereotypes that are
associated with opera, but the
operatic experience can be the
ultimate culmination of all the
various art forms."
As for what Swedberg hopes
people take from the show? He
simply wants the audience "to be
entertained and have a good eve-
ning in the theater." And what
could be better than watching
a sitcom brought to life before
your eyes?

Lacking lesbian love stories

'Hocus Pocus' has all brewings
of a potentially great musical

By GRACE PROSINEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
If you're like me, you've
already fully immersed your-
self in the winter holiday spirit,
and Halloween seems like a
distant memory. But to Hallow-
een we must return, if just for
a moment, to discuss matters of
grave importance.
A few weeks ago, I was in
Salem, Mass., visiting all the
buildings used for exterior
shots in the cult classic, "Hocus
Pocus." I was completely in
my element, pointing, out the
familiar scenery and quoting
my favorite lines. Then, without
warning, my sister uttered the
fateful line: "You know they're
thinking of making a 'Hocus
Pocus' musical on Broadway."
This changes everything.
For those of you who don't
know, "Hocus Pocus" is a 1993
film staring Bette Midler, Sarah
Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy
as the Sanderson Sisters, three
witches who try to remain
young by stealing the souls of
children. It initially received
negative reviews upon its theat-
rical release by whom, I can only
assume, to be humorless vam-
pires wishing to suck the joy and
wonder out of life.
"Hocus Pocus" climbed its
way to the top through strong
VHS and eventually DVD sales,
as well as record viewership on
ABC Family's "13 Nights of Hal-
loween." So here we are now, 20

The other day, I sat down to do
my drawing homework and began
scrolling through Netflix. Might
as well multitask, drown out
the sound of my boyfriend talk-
ing about chemistry and watch
a movie. I opted for the quirky,
witty feel-good section and stum-
bled upon "Kissing Jessica Stein,"
a movie about a journalist (inter-
ested) in search of the perfect man
(boring), but who instead finds
herself the perfect woman (sold!).
I settled in, ready for a rom-com, in
which the two lesbians would find
their happily-ever-after (because
we all know they'll never get it in
a Disney movie) - however, by the
end, it became blatantly apparent
that wouldn't be the case.
Jessica, played by Jennifer
Westfeldt, responds to a personal
ad in women-seeking-women
that quotes Rilke, which auto-
matically interests the literarily
inclined, heterosexual character.
She decides going on a date with a
girl could be exciting, adventurous
and a definite change of pace from
her painfully single, uptight life-
style. She meets art house director
Helen Cooper, played by Heather
Juergensen, and the two become
romantically involved. Jessica
goes through a whole string of
emotions about it - shocked,
excited, hesitant, freaked out and
finally settling on a serious case
of denial. She tells her coworkers
that she's seeing a man and even
neglects to invite her girlfriend
to her brother's wedding. Finally,
after a touching "I'm-going-to-
see-about-a-girl"-type scene, the
two make up, U-Haul and begin
to live a life of blissful domes-
ticity where they retrieve each
other's dry-cleaning and wear
pajama sets to bed. A cute, les-
bian movie where lesbian love is
legitimized and taken seriously,
youthink. You're wrong.
Three months later, the two
are found mid-breakup. Helen
argues that the two are simply
roommates, not lovers, and Jessi-
ca cries without much refute that
she has become attached to their
co-dependent lifestyle. Helen
leaves, but the movie continues,
and Jessica ends up with her
male boss whom she had dated in
college.
I closed my computer and
thought for a moment, landing
on the realization that the movie
was actually kind of a cop-out.
Jessica Stein was just one in a
string of many women in movies

'The best damn coach on this campus'

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
The arched roof of Jenison
Fieldhouse in East Lansing once
housed Earvin "Magic" Johnson.
It hosted Mississippi State and
Loyola Chicago in the 1963 NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament,
which helped advance civil rights
in one of the nation's most tenuous
times.
But on a day in January 1976,
the dusty court of the hallowed
building was disturbed not by the
cheers of thousands, but by the
methodic pounding of a basketball
as Carol Hutchins and the rest of
the Michigan State women's bas-
ketball team ran through drills.
Partway through the practice, a
prominent visiting men's Division
I squad walked into the building,
familiarizing itself with thevenue
before a game against the Spar-
tans later in the week. Then the
visitors stepped onto the court,
ignoring Hutchins and her team-
mates, and began to warm up.
By then, the head coach of the
visiting team was quite well-
known, and he would go on to
enjoy a long career. But when he
finally acknowledged Hutchins,
his stinging words ultimately
came as less of an insult than they
were the utterance of a painfully
obvious truth.
"No one gives a damn about
women's basketball."
And then he kicked them out.
Growing up in Lansing along-
side five siblings, Hutchins, now
entering her 30th year as the
Michigan softball coach, would
spend her afternoons and sum-
mers outdoors on the playground.
She never quite understood why,
but she always loved sports.
But when her three brothers
were old enough to join organized
teams, Hutchins didn't have the
same options. They went on to
Little League, and she had to sit
on the bleachers. They played bas-
ketball, and she watched from a
distance.
For lack of a better option,
Hutchins enlisted in her school's
cheerleading team in middle

school and high school, the only
varsity sport available to her. It
was far from ideal, but it was the
only way she could get from the
stands onto the field.
"I went and cheered for my
brothers, even though ISwas better
than them," Hutchins said.
Girls who wanted to play any
other sport had to rely on gym
class and sometimes hastily
arranged after-school activities -
no schedules, no uniforms and no
varsityletter.
Despite the extent that the law
would soon change Hutchins's
life, the day Title IX passed in 1972
didn't seem out of the ordinary to
the high-school student. Hutchins
didn't come home and tell her par-
ents that she could soon play orga-
nized sports. The implications of
Title IX on athletics weren't fully
realized until later; after all, it was
part of the Educational Amend-
ments of 1972 and had no explicit
relation to sports.
Instead, the 37 words of the law
state that no organization that
receives federal financial assis-
tance can deny benefits to people
on the basis of sex. In other words,
if a school wanted money from the
government, it couldn't discrimi-
nate against women.
In her senior year, Hutchins's
high school handed the girls' bas-
ketball team uniforms and a full
schedule and promised to make
arrangements for away games -
commodities it had never offered
before. A giddy Hutchins bought
her first pair of Adidas Superstar
shoes.
"I was in heaven," she said. "It
just gave us the same opportunity.
I don't deserve more opportunity.
I just want the same opportunity."
At that point, Hutchins was
content with enrolling at Michi-
gan State, especially since the
school demonstrated a progres-
sive attitude toward women's
sports. Her softball team even
won a national championship,
though it's only recognized by the
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women, and not the
NCAA.
At first there were no schol-
arships, but no one complained
about having to earn playing time
as a walk-on. Hutchins didn't

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins has been one of the pioneers of Title IX since its inception in 1972.

mind that the men had first choice
to all of the school's facilities and
that the women would be slotted
in as an afterthought, if at all.
But beyond the lack of avail-
able scholarships, there were still
countless inequalities between
men's and women's sports. The
women played at Jenison Field-
house just once per year when the
Athletic Department scheduled
a doubleheader with the men.
And in stark contrast to the men,
Hutchins and her teammates
wore a conglomeration of T-shirts
and shorts instead of school-
issued practice uniforms.
After watching her broth-
ers from the sidelines as a child,
Hutchins was happy just to play
- until, in one moment at Jeni-
son Fieldhouse, a men's basketball
coach changed her mind.
"Whatever the guys had, we
were like this," Hutchins said,
holding one hand high above the
other. "We were always second.
Back then, you had athletics and
then you had women's athletics."
In 1979, Hutchins sued Michi-
gan State, alleging that the school
provided better housing options
on road trips and a higher per
diem to male athletes. Two years
later, a preliminary injunction

barred the university from dis-
criminating against the women's
basketball team.
"Unless you filed suit, there was
no reason for an Athletic Depart-
ment to change," she said.
Former Athletic Director Don
Canham hired Hutchins as Mich-
igan's assistant softball coach
in 1982 and promoted her to the
head role three years later. As she
remembers with a wry laugh, her
initial job description mandated
she spend half the day perform-
ing clerical work for the Athletic
Department.
When she finished her office
duties, Hutchins had to take care
of Alumni Field on her own, bor-
rowing the tractor from the base-
ball team and driving it herself.
Once, she crashed it into the out-
field fence.
Getting the field watered was a
daily struggle. One season, it went
weeks without so much as a drop.
When it eventually became nearly
unplayable, the Athletic Depart-
ment finally brought in a fire truck
to douse the field.
But even if it seemed like she
was competing against the base-

ball team, Hutchins stresses that
Title IX was never about pitting
men against women.
"My biggestbattles were not on
the softball field," Hutchins said.
"They were getting the resources
my team needed to be successful."
One spring, both the softball
and baseball teams had road trips
to Indiana on the same day. When
they arrived, Hutchins walked
over to the baseball diamond
to pick up an extra set of lineup
cards, because she had forgotten
her own in Ann Arbor. There, she
noticed that the baseball team had
been given a charteredbus. Mean-
while, the Athletic Department
had offered the softball players
vans.
"When I first came to Michi-
gan, they just wanted to be great
in the men's sports," Hutchins
said. "It was a very reluctant
atmosphere (for the women)."
When Bo Schembechler
became Athletic Director in 1988,
he helped usher in reform for
women's athletics at Michigan, a
shift that continued under Jack
Weidenbach's reign in the early
1990s. For instance, it was because
of Schembechler that the softball
team finally received enough
practice uniforms to wear all
week long. And little by little, the
resources provided to women's
sports began to increase.
"There were two things Bo
loved: Michigan, and a well-run
program," explains historian
John U. Bacon, who authored Bo's
Lasting Lessons, aswell as several
other books about college football.
"Hutch was both."
Even when Hutchins had to
tend to Alumni Field and spend
half the day as a secretary, the
Wolverines never endured a los-
ing season with her in charge.
They won their first Big Ten title
in 1992 and proceeded to claim
two of the next three. And with
that came the respect ofthe restnof
the University.
In October 1996, Bacon and
Schembechler drove back togeth-
er to Ann Arbor from Grand
Rapids, arriving on campus well
after everyone had left the ath-
letic campus. As they pulled into
the parking lot by the old soft-
ball facilities, Schembechler saw
Hutchins finally walking out of
her office for the night.
"Look at that!" Bacon remem-
bers Schembechler saying. "Ten-
thirty at night, and she's working
her ass off. That is the best damn
coach on this campus."
Then he paused, remembering
then-football coach Lloyd Carr.
"The best women's coach."
In 2005, the Michigan softball
team made history by becoming
the first team east of the Missis-
sippi River to win the Women's
College World Series. Down by a
game in the best-of-three series,
the Wolverines clawed back to
take the second game. In the 10th
inning of the decisive contest,
freshman Samantha Findlay hit a
three-run shot over the left-field
wall to give her team the title.
The Wolverines mobbed each
other at home plate, and because
the triumph was broadcast
nationally, millions could watch
their accomplishment.

After the game, Hutchins cried.
"Everyone's all on board now,"
she said. "Back in those days, it

seemed like we were always going
to be the second class."
When the softball team
returned to Ann Arbor that
summer, Hutchins's phone was
flooded with congratulatory
voicemails, and she turned on her
computer to hundreds of unread
emails. People recognized her
when she walked through the city
the following day, and Schem-
bechler himself waited on a street
cornerto greet her.
"Hutchins made a big convert
out of an old-school guy," Bacon
said.
Schembechler wasn't the only
figure on campus buying into
Hutchins's program. Hundreds
of miles away in Parry Sound,
Ont., hockey coach Red Berenson
watched that final game on televi-
sion. When it ended, he began to
tear up, and at the first coaches'
meetinginthe fall, he walked over
to Hutchins and asked for a hug.
"Why would I care aboutnwom-
en's softball?" he said. "This is
Michigan women's softball. This
is Carol Hutchins."
In March, the Michigan soft-
ball team will open its home
schedule against Bowling Green,
unveiling the latest addition to
Alumni Field: an AstroTurf sur-
face that allows the Wolverines
to practice outdoors, even in cold
weather.
This spring will also mark the
completion of a brand-new soft-
ball center, a three-story building
which will feature locker rooms,
fitness centers and hydrotherapy
pools. The 10,200-square-foot
complex cost $5.3 million alone,
while the University spent $2.5
million combined to retrofit the
baseball and softball fields with
AstroTurf.
And Hutchins will be enter-
ing her 30th season as leader of
that softball team. She's the win-
ningestcoach in Michigan history
and has twice been named NCAA
Coach of the Year. Her teams have
finished atop the Big Ten in 16 of
the last 21years, including the last
six in a row.
When the Wolverines beat
Northwestern to clinch a first-
place finish in the conference last
May, many of the 1,800 fans in
attendance waited outside Alumni
Field to applaud Hutchins as she
walked back to the locker room.
The relationship between
men's and women's sports isn't
entirely equal. For example,
accordingto a survey by Brooklyn
College researchers, more than 97
percent of men's collegiate pro-
grams in 2012 were coached by a
man. But that same year, only 43
percent of women's teams had
female coaches - a 47-percent
decrease from 1972, when Title IX
was introduced.
But it's certainly a step up from
being kicked off her home court
by a visiting team in East Lansing
those dozens of years ago.
Despite the flaws, plentyofsigns
pointto the amendment's success.
Never in the history of collegiate
sports have there been more
female athletes or more women's
programs per school than today.
In many ways, Hutchins says,
we're closer to equal opportunity
than ever before.

And the public has responded.
The Michigan softball team has
been on national TV more than
40 times since 2005, including 14
times in the last two years.
Every game of the 2013 Wom-
en's College World Series was
broadcast on ESPN, and several
aired on ESPN International from
Africa, to the Middle East, to
Latin America.
"Look how far we've come.
Who would have ever thought
that could happen?" Hutchins
said. "What makes me smile is
seeing where women have come
today and the opportunitieswe all
have. I don'ttake it forgranted."
When the current group of
seniors on the Michigan softball
team arrived on campusfour years
ago, they came to Ann Arbor with
access to some of the best athletic
facilities in the nation. They all
grew up playing sports because
the world wasn't tellingthemthey
couldn't. But when Hutchins men-
tioned Title IX, one of them asked,
"what's that?"
So Hutchins sat them down and
told themher story.

Indiana first in conf. tournament

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Defensive coordinator Greg Mattison held Nebraska to 17 points but wishes he had taken a timeout-on a key fourth down.
Mattison laments play

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Hindsight is always 20-20, as
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke would remind the public
when asked about what he would
change about the team's 17-13 loss
to Nebraska on Saturday.
Unlike Hoke, though, defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison
seems to be kicking himself after
reviewing the game film. He can
easily pinpoint the one thing
he wished he could go back and
change - it was a timeout, or rath-
er, one he didn't call.
. Watching the tape takes Mat-
tison back to that moment, to the
fourth quarter, when Michigan
had a three-point lead over the
Cornhuskers. Nebraska was in
the middle of a 75-yard drive, but
the Wolverines were solid enough
that they had stopped the Corn-
huskers on the Michigan 31-yard
line, facing a fourth-and-2.
But Nebraska surprised the
Wolverines by deciding to go for
it as opposed to attempting a field
goal to tie the game.
There were enough reasons
for the Cornhuskers to want to
go for it on the fourth down. In

his postgame press conference,
Nebraska coach Bo Pelini said the
wind was just strong enough that
he didn't think his kicker would
be in a good position to succeed.
Cornhusker quarterback Tommy
Armstrong Jr. said they had so
much momentum on that drive,
it didn't even occur to him the
coaches would try and do any-
thingbutgo for it.
The next play sealed the Wol-
verines' fate - Nebraska con-
verted the first down, not just by
barreling two yards, but with a
short pass that was run up about
20 yards to set up a first-and-goal
that eventually led to a touch-
down.
Watching the film, Mattison
now sees all the glaring signs
indicating he should've called a
timeout.
"We were in man coverage,
and we've got two young guys
and they weren't in as tight cov-
erage as they should've been," he
said. "I'll put that on me."
Mattison said reminding
those two young guys - fresh-
men defensive backs Dymonte
Thomas and Channing Stribling
- to tighten up their coverage
could've changed everything.

In fact, Mattison mentioned
four times during his Tuesday
press conference that he wished
he'd called the timeout to remind
the two to reposition, citing the
Cornhuskers' "fast offense" as
one of the things that caught the
Wolverines off guard.
Now, Mattison says he's left
lamenting his lapse in judgment
that could've changed the course
of Michigan's season.
"You're two plays away from
sitting here 8-1," he said. "Hope-
fully the next time that happens,
you don't see (the cornerbacks) do
that. It was a shame it was a 4th-
and-two."
Stopping that play would've
been a huge momentum changer,
but Mattison is trying to down-
play the importance of a misstep
like that - with the Michigan
defense having to take on an
increased role as of late due to
offensive miscues, he tries not to
bring it up too much.
"Throughout the years, our
offense has bailed us out a num-
ber of times," Mattison said. "Our
message to our team before the
game is you are accountable to
every other guy in that defensive
room."

away with the win and the Big
Bear Trophy.
* "We have to have a short-term
memory," Miller said. "We ana-
lyze the last performance, and
we move on."
The Hoosiers (2-4, 6-11-1)
ended their disappointingseason
on a high note last Saturday with
a 3-0 win against Northwestern.
Indiana has won three of its last
11 games.
The Hoosier offense is led by
senior midfielders AJ Corrado, a
2012 third-team All-American,
and Nikita Kotlov, who leads the
team in both assists and goals.
Indiana will look to pressure the
ball and create quality chances at
the Michigan goal.
"(The Hoosiers) are a good
team," Daley said. "They're prob-.
ably the best 6-11 team in the his-
tory of college soccer." .
The two teams last met in
late October at the U-M Soccer
Stadium, where the Wolver-
ines walked away victorious in
a 2-1 thriller for their first-ever
win over Indiana in Ann Arbor.
Michigan again dominated most

of the first half, but it was the
Hoosiers who found the back
of the net, giving them a 1-0 -
lead going into halftime. The
second half was better for the-,
Wolverines, as freshman for-
ward Yamann Sahlool tied the
score- and junior midfielder TJ
VanSlooten put away a rebound
late in the half to allow Michigan
to escape with the win.
But this time around, the Wol-
verines will be missing two key
stalwarts on their back line.
Brown and freshman defender
Lars Eckenrode, two mainstays
on the Michigan defense, will
have to miss the game. Brown is
missing the game due to his red
card in Saturday's game against
Michigan State. Eckenrode was
given his fifth yellow card of the
season, which results in a one-
game suspension. The absences
of these two players will test the
Wolverines' depth.
"We have a deep team," Miller
said. "We have a lot of guys who
can step up and are more than
capable of doing the job. It's not -
that big of a deal."

reshmen share long-standing history

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
Evan Allen remembers his
coach's pregame speech before
he and fellow Michigan fresh-
man forward Tyler Motte's
Detroit Honeybaked squad lined
up against Team Illinois a few
years back. Their coach told them
to watch out for a kid named JT
Compher.
"I remember coach saying they
had a strong player, JT Compher,"
Allen said. "He was the best play-
er on the ice and really hard to
play against."
Honeybaked and Team Illinois
are two of the most respected
youth ptograms in the nation,
raking in regional and national
championships on an annual
basis. From being old youth hock-
ey rivals to lacing up their skates
against Division I competition,
Allen, Compher and Motte's paths'
have frequently converged on and
off the ice.
After many years as rivals,
Allen, Motte and Compher joined
forces as a part of the Michigan
hockey team's 2013 recruiting
class. The trio has played on the
same line for nearly a month,
becoming the team's second-most
productive unit with 11 points in

Allen and Motte share a rich
history as teammates during their
emergence as top youth play-
ers in the Midwest Elite Hockey
League. They met for the, first
time nearly seven years ago, and
have both been playing against
Compher for just as long.
"Chicago and Detroit obviously
have three to four teams each (in
the MEHL)," Motte said. "It was
always a big rivalry, so we would
see each other in big tourna-
ments. We would see each other
a lot in semifinals, so it's been a
great rivalry for awhile."
Just two years ago, the trio
was selected to join the United
States National Team Develop-
ment Program with 20 other top
players from around the country.
It was there, through the program
based in Ann Arbor, that the trio
became a tight-knit group.
"They're together at one high
school from seven in the morning
all the way until six at night every
single day, so the bond between
teammates was extremely tight,"
said former U.S. NTDP coach Don
Granato. "It was more of a best-
friend type of relationship."
Playing under Granato, Motte
and Compher were often paired
on the same line, developing
plenty of chemistry along the

were highly regarded as superb
two-way players with the ability
to grind it out in the corners and
shut down high-octane forwards.
"They could perform well at a
high-skill game from a defensive
standpoint. and a grind-it-out
game from a scoring standpoint,"
Granato said.
Allen, on the other hand, has
always possessed a different play-
ing style than his two teammates.
He's had p knack for scoring ever
since his days at Honeybaked,
where he says he and Mottewere
typically the go-to guys.
Granato recalls constantly.
searching for more ways to get
Allen in spots where he could
shoot the puck. Allen netted 23
goals last season with the NTDP,
where stats are often deflated
with a demanding schedule
against top collegiate and inter-
national programs.
Allen, Compher and Motte
have hardly changed their ways
since coming to Michigan, and
that comes as no surprise to
Granato and Michigan coach Red
Berenson.
Allen continues to put pucks in
the net, and Compher continues
to be a scrapper in front of the
crease and in the defensive cor-
ners. Motte is making his case as

on the Wolverines' roster and has
sniped a couple gdals early in the
season.
"Tyler is a good two-way play-
er, smart with the puck," Beren-
son said. "The puck seems to
find him and follow him around.
Well, that's because he's in the
right place at the right time. He's
always had a history of scoring.
Defensively, he's earning our
trust, and that's important."
All three of Michigan's stand-
out freshmen agree they made the
best decision by staying in Ann
Arbor after their NTDP careers.
Even before the trio teamed up on
the national team, they discussed
where their paths might cross

next.
Roughly a year before joining
the NTDP, Motte and Compher
recall playing in a prospects tour-
nament in Toronto where, at the
time, they hardly knew each other
and were paired on the same line.
They scored a few points during
the showcase event and decided
to stay in touch afterwards.
"We had really good chemistry
when we played in that tourna-
ment together," Compher said.
"It was kind of like, why don't
we keep that going, and then we
ended up making the national
program."
Compher was the first to com-
mit to Michigan, and then Allen

joined conversations with Motte
about coming. There was no rea-
son to dismantle what was work-
ing, and the chemistry between
the three has been a critical base
for the Wolverines' early success
this season.
On the ice, they're three of
the most dynamic freshmen in
the country. After practice and
outside team meetings, the trio's
long-lasting friendship continues
to prosper. When asked if the trio
influenced each other's decisions
during the recruiting process,
Motte said it certainly didn't hurt.
There's no telling how long
their roads will remain connected
after their Michigan careers.

Freshman forward JT Compher is on a line with two other rookies, but the unit hast11 points in eight games this season.

Michigan dominates

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Exactly one year before Michi-
gan'sgame against South Carolina
State on Tuesday night, the team
beat IUPUI at Crisler Center.
T Sophomore guard Caris LeVert
didn't see the floor that night -
he was a redshirt candidate and
Swouldn't get
'his first SC STATE 59
taste of MICHIGAN 93
playing time
until Dec. 1.
One year later, as -the Wolver-
ines cruised past the Bulldogs, it
was clear what a difference a year
has made for LeVert.
Michigan (2-0) looked sluggish
in the first half of its first regular-
season game on Friday, scoring
just 23 points against UMass Low-
ell. But Tuesday, the team came
out of the gate quicker and, with
the help of sharp shooting from
LeVert, rolled to a 93-59 win.
"We just came out with more.
energy," LeVert said. "We got
some stops early that led to fast-
break buckets, and I think that
was the difference."
On Michigan's second posses-
sion of the game, freshman guard
Derrick Walton Jr. drove to his
right and finished a tough layup
after being fouled. He got up and
'knocked down the free throw to
complete the and-one play, setting
the tone for Michigan in the first
half.
The team shot 20-for-30 from
the field and knocked down 12
3-pointers in the first half. Early
in the game, freshman guard Zak
Irvin had two open looks from
behind the arc but missed both
times. Onthe possession following
his second miss, Irvin had anoth-
er open look for three but instead
penetrated toward the basket and
threw a crisp pass to LeVert in the
corner. LeVert squared his shoul-
ders, released the ball and drained
the 3-pointer - the first of five
he'd hit in as many minutes.
Following the 3-pointer, Michi-
gan's game plan was simple: get

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Sophomore guard Caris LeVert had a career-high 24 points on just 11 shots, including six 3-pointers.
Hot as e to blowout

ADAM GLANZA
Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas had a career-high 23 points in the win.

the ball to LeVert behind the arc
and then hustle back on defense.
Walton assisted on LeVert's sec-
ond 3-pointer and sophomore
guard Nik Stauskas set up LeVert
for his next two triples. On Staus-
kas's second assist, he fed a pass to
LeVert in the corner and turned to
go back on defense before the ball
fell through the net.
It was that kind of night for the
Pickerington, Ohio native. If the
ball came out of LeVert's hands,
there was a good chance it was
going into the basket - 64 per-
cent.
He finished the night 7-of-11
from the field for a career-high 24
points. He also added four assists
and three rebounds.
"He is a nightmare on a close-
out," said Michigan coach John
Beilein. "Somebody has got to go
get to him. He can shoot it or go
by you,.and his seeing the floor is
huge for us."
When LeVert came out, Staus-
kas stepped up and took over the
3-point-shooting party with five of
his own from behind the arc and
finished the night with 23 points.
The Wolverines finished the half
with 12 3-pointers and headed to
the locker room leading 59-23.
Michigan didn't slow down in

the second half despite the Bull-
dogs mixing up their defense,
switching from a zone to trap-
ping and pressing the Wolverine
offense.
Sophomore forward Glenn Rob-
inson III threw down a dunk 14
seconds into the half, and Beilein
didn't show any signs of letting
up until two minutes remained,
when he sent in the freshmen to
finish up the lopsided win.
It's early in the season, but so
far it's clear that LeVert is Michi-
gan's most improved player, and
his ability to step up will play a big
part in the Wolverines' fate this
year.
"This is a great start for him,"
Beilein said. "Who are you going
to take out in that lineup right
now so that somebody else can
play? ... We can tweak some things
some more, but at the same time,
LeVert has got to be out there on
the floor."
NOTE: Robinson, redshirt
junior Jon Horford and fifth-
year senior Jordan Morgan were
named captains. It's the ninth
time in program history the Wol-
verines have had three or more
captains. Robinson is just the
fourth sophomore to be named a
captain.

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
With 18:25 left in the first half
of the Michigan men's basket-
ball team's Tuesday night game
against South Carolina State,
Glenn Robinson III took a seat
on the bench. After being named
one of three team captains earli-
er in the day, the sophomore for-
ward was taken out of the game
after picking up an early foul.
Freshman forward Zak Irvin,
a player Michigan coach John
Beilein has identified as a shoot-
er that spreads the court with
his 6-foot-6 frame, came off the
bench. On the Wolverines' first
possession after the substitu-
tion, Irvin missed a three from
the corner. On the next Michigan
(2-0) possession, the same result
occurred, a rimmed-out 3-point
attempt.
The waythe ballwas bouncing,
it seemed like the game would be
similar to the Wolverines' opener
against UMass Lowell, in which
they shot 1-for-9 from three and
let a newly minted Division I
team stick around for much lon-
ger than itshould have.
Then an extra pass was made
and all of a sudden Michigan
couldn't miss from beyond the
arc, as its lead ballooned to 20
and then some in the team's
93-59 win.

After a defensive rebound by
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas,
the ball found itself in the hands
of Irvin once again. But with
sophomore guard Caris LeVert
standing in the left corner, Irvin
made the extra pass. With his
feet set and his body in perfect
rotation, LeVert rose up and fired
the ball toward the hoop. After
hitting every nook and cranny
of the structure, the ball dipped
into the hoop to give Michigan
an 8-S lead.
His teammates sensed some-
thing was going on with LeVert,
and freshman guard Derrick
Walton Jr. followed protocol,
making the extra pass once again
as LeVert made his second shot
with a clean swish.
"There was no question, when
Caris got it going, they were
looking," Beilein said. "They love
Caris LeVert, and I wasn't tak-
ing him out until he missed one
because he didn't need a rest"
The key for the Wolverines in
this sequence, and throughout
the first half, was their ability
to get the ball in transition and
run plays with the Bulldogs (1-2)
stuck in a zone defense.
"Because of clean rebounds
and fast breaks, we didn't run a
lot of plays today," Beilein said.
"We just ran the ball up (with)
just the nature of the fast break.
If you're going to play zone, I

think this team can get open
looks against a lot of zones. And
we have enough skilled guys to
do that."
With steady rebounds and
quick bursts downcourt, LeVert
continued to find himself open
as the ball moved around the
perimeter. In fact, he was so
wide open in the first half that by
the 11:42 mark, he already had 15
points on 5-for-5 shooting from
beyond the arc. Though Levert
cooled off a bit in the second half,
he still recorded a career-high 24
points on just 11 shots, including
six attempts from deep.
.Not to be outdone, Stauskas
knocked down five deep balls of
his own to match LeVert going
into the locker rooms. Stauskas
scored a career-high 23 points.
Though LeVert didn't want
to admit there was competition
going on between the two, Staus-
kas couldn't help but gush at the
idea of catching up to LeVert's
early hot hand. At the same time,
he noted it was getting the ball
out front that enabled the Wol-
verines to record their second-
most 3-pointers in a game (15) in
program history.
"Wehad alot ofguys that were
passing the ball well, driving the
ball well," Stauskas said. "And

Until recently there wasn't a

except that without it things went
wrong. Some neuroscientists
argue that most damage caused
through sleep deprivation could
be reversed with, well, sleeping.
But, what the brain experiences
during sleep that rejuvenates the
body is difficult to decipher. More
recently it was found that dur-
ing sleep, memory consolidation
occurs, which helps strengthen
something learned or experienced

In the study, the researchers
taught participants two different
musical melodies and then had
them take naps. While napping,
the researchers played one of the
melodies and found that once the
participants were awake, they
could play the tune they had heard
while asleep with fewer mistakes
- they knew it better. However,
it's important to note that for the
improvement to learning to be
actualized, the sleeper needs to
be consolidating already learned
material. It's like re-reading your
notes over and over again, after
you read it the first time, each
time after is a reinforcement. And

n my parent's kitchen, a glossy
Kodak print appeared on the
counter sometime last year.
In the photograph, my six-year old
cheeks are chubby and rose-colored.
Gleaming, my grandpas have made a
semi-successful attempt to pull me
onto their laps, leaving my corduroy-
clad legs dangling just above the
ground.
Now, more than a decade has passed
since a yellow drugstore disposable
camera first held this motion still. Both
of my grandpas looked younger then.
Outside the frames on a 35 mm reel,
pasts don't stand so static.
In the popular imagination,
grandfathers are often depicted as
keepers of history. Seated in worn,
leather armchairs, grandfathers
recount the olden days before roaring
fires as curious youngsters lean close,
hanging on every word.
My grandpas don't fit that image.
My paternal grandfather, Sol, stared
up at the gates at Auschwitz when he
was younger than me. His stories are
veiled under sprinkles of Yiddish and
an accent that at 90 still won't let go.

And if you ever see Martin, my
mom's dad, he probably won't hesitate
to joke around a bit. That's because
Martin is by no means the stuffy
armchair and cigar grandfather. He's a
boxer and spends a good portion of the
day pacing his yard with a well-loved
hedge trimmer.
But if grandfathers are supposed
to be the torchbearers of history, I
was confused about what that history
might say.
Sol, whose Auschwitz number,
B-4907, I had traced with my fingers
for years, was forgetting fast. Of
course, the images of bodies and smoke
and fire cannot be un-etched. But from
the time I interviewed him for an
eighth grade project to last year, when
I decided to record his history on tape,
his memories have lost their vividness.
At least in articulating them, his
once clearer images are now jumbled
and vague. In aging, stories were
lost, misplaced somewhere in the five
decades since Poland.
And while Sol struggled to piece
together the chronology, Martin's past
was becoming even more real.
In 2006, Martin was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease. Dopamine-
producin cells bean to die offleading

to shaking and difficulty performing
certain motor skills.
On a drug called Aricept, often
prescribed to Parkinson's patients, my
Grandpa Martin's memories became
more vivid than they had ever been.
He dreams every night now of
his parents, his childhood in the
Berkshires and being behind the
counter at his father's hardware store.
Most of the memories are happy. But in
the quiet moments, Martin's past - his
people, his childhood - are dug up and
presented before him everyday.
In the last few years, he's gotten
up a few times to write things down,
afraid his life is an unwritten memoir
that might disappear. He's also taken
to collecting clocks. Dozens of them
crowd my grandma's piano, at times
ticking all at once.
While Grandpa Sol forgot, Grandpa
Martin couldn't help but remember.
As my grandpas age, I have started
to think about my own past. Of
course, mine has been short thus far. I
certainly haven't faced the destruction
of the Holocaust or 70 years worth of
living.

But as my life trucks ahead, I wonder
how I will eventually confront my own
history.
I have loved the past since I first
arranged museum exhibits in my room,
forcing my sister to brave my tours of
coins and stamps and broken shells. In
my painted-blue room, I had the power
to arrange the past just how I wanted.
But now, as one grandpa forgets and
the other remembers, I wonder how
much agency we have in arranging
our own histories. Is it impossible to
remember what I want and to forgot
what hurts the most?
In observing my grandpas confront
their pasts in vastly different ways,
it's become clear I might not have too
much choice in the memories I choose
to retain or discard.
What I have found is a complicated
picture about how memory works.
I'm no expert on how neurons fire or
how the temporal lobe decides wharfo
keep or let slip away. But as a journalist
and a student of history, I have learned
pasts are deeply complicated.
My grandpas have taught me the
ways we process them are, too.

CONTINUED FROM PAGESB
"I put Max in front of donors, and within
ays, somebody says, 'I want to support what
that guy's doing because he makes sense,' "
May said. "He just has this wonderful style
- what a gift, to be a great researcher and be
able to talk with people. Those things aren't
always together, some people are just amaz-
ing researchers but they might have trouble
axplaining the complexity ofthat to a layman."
The hours can be long, especially in the
fall. May said many development officers rou-
tinely work 70 to 80 hour weeks, including
football Saturdays. Some Fridays, he'll attend
three dinners before the night is through.
When May focused on planning the Vic-
tors for Michigan campaign, his job was
about 70 percent internal, focused on plan-
ning the campaign's rollout and coordinating
with development officers around the coun-
try. In the run-up to the immediate launch of
the campaign on Nov. 8, it was between 60
, 70 percent external development again,
directly engaging with donors.
He added that University President
Mary Sue Coleman, widely lauded as one
of the most successful fundraisers in high-
er education, will spend about 40 percent
of her time around the campaign's launch
on development.
"She loves meeting strangers, she loves
building relationships," May said. "From
that perspective, she's an ideal fundrais-
ing president."
May said the University's deans will spend
little as 20 percent and as much as 40 per-
cent oftheir time on development for theirunit.
In the Wolverine's den
For donors at the highest level, a trip to
Ann Arbor can be a whirlwind of advisory
meetings, dinners with deans and faculty, or
even an exclusive Friday night soiree with
President Coleman, her husband, Ken Cole-
man, and May. Football weekends add anoth-
er element to the mix.
"All we do all night is just have a good time,"
May said. "We talk about things, they get to
do a Q&A with Mary Sue at the end of the eve-
ning, then the next morning, they may have a
breakfast meeting with a dean, or if it's an early
game, they might go straight to the president's
tailgate ... I might introduce them or other
people might introduce them to other people
who are in the same profession thatthey didn't
know. It's anetworkingkind of thing."
May usually sees only ten plays in a foot-
ball game. Being at Michigan Stadium usu-
ally means he's on duty - engaging with
alumni and donors, their families, and build-
ing relationships.
S-"Usually those weekends are fun week-
ends - especially if they bring their family,"
May said. "We want to know their spouses,
particularly the spouses that didn't go to
Michigan, because we want them to adopt
Michigan. We want them to have fun here,
we want them to have agood experience."
One of the most powerful stories is that of
students. Since student support is the Vic-
tors for Michigan campaign's top priority,

giving donors a narrative that will inspire
them is critical.
Friday's flagship kick-off event at Hill
Auditorium was meant to do just that: flashy
performances, professional motivational vid-
eos and well-scripted student speeches, all
designed to impress the University's biggest
donors and motivate students for the cam-
paign ahead.
Shifting focuses
The Michigan Difference Campaign
raised $545 million for scholarships and stu-
dent support between 2004 and 2008.
Phil Hanlon and Martha Pollack asked

money for scholarships," Rogel said. "It was
just not something people were that much
interested in. As they've seen the cutbacks ...
scholarship support has become increasingly
important focus of our alumni."
Since student testimonials and energy
will be critical to the success of the overall
campaign, the office of Development has
created an 18-member student campaign
committee to help motivate students to get
involved in the initiative.
LSA junior Monique Becker, one of the
members of the committee, said since one
of the main goals of the campaign is student
support, reaching out to students (and soon-
to-be graduates), is building the groundwork

and giving and alumni support will increase."
Matching the needs of the University
with the interest of donors is not always a
perfect fit. Niche research needs are diffi-
cult to raise money for - as is endowment
support for maintaining existing buildings
and structures.
"Sometimes a faculty member wakes up
in the morning and says 'I'd love to have a
building that does X, or a program that does
Y,"' Slottow said. "But the feasibility of that
may be close to zero. There may be no donor
in the world who is interested in giving to
that thing."
Victors for Michigan will also focus on
providing students with new engaged learn-
ing opportunities, both field excursions and
non-traditional ways of interacting with pro-
fessors, technology and peers on campus. The
final goal is fundraising for "big ideas" that
can confront global issues like sustainability
through research.
As federal funding for research declines
due to the federal sequester, an across the
board cut to federal agencies, including those
that support research endeavors, the Univer-
sity will increasingly rely on donors to support
and expand its research portfolio.
"This is a pretty high pressure business,"
May said. "I've made it out in a way that I see
it - and that's that it's a lot of fun. But it's a
business. And it's a high pressure business."
"We have to remind people that the donor
is the most important person in the process."
Expanding Blue's reach
As the University looks to the future,
development will continue to play a key role
even after the conclusion of the campaign.
One of the benefits of a campaign is that
after it concludes, annual giving stays up
higher compared to its previous level. People
get in the habit of giving more on an annual
basis than before.
May said there's some discussion of locat-
ing development officers overseas - with East
Asia as the first target. While it's prohibitively
expensive to do so now, he added that it may
become worthwhile to permanently station
University representatives abroad in the not-
to-distant future.
"It's very expensive to do internation-
al fundraising, it's a longer time horizon
because we're dealing with different cul-
tures, and some of those cultures don't have
the same philanthropic spirit that America
has," May said.
The University's bicentennial celebration
- which will begin in 2017 - will also be a
huge part of motivating donors and thinking
ahead to the future. The yearlong celebration
will have a time horizon spanning back two
hundred years. Jerry May is already looking
forward to the next two hundred.
"Whatever the motivations are, there are
people who then say, 'Ok, we realize Michi-
gan is in this for the long run, we know
Michigan is going to be here hundreds of
years from now, we can look in the long term
in our investments, I guess I'll give to one of
those things.' "

May to (nearly) double it. The goal for the
Victors for Michigan campaign will be $1bil-
lion for student support.
"I just have to say, we swallowed hard,"
May said. "We thought, well, we might be
able to get to $800 million, with a lot of hard
work and some really big gifts - like $25 or
$50 million gifts for scholarships - but the
provost made the case that we needed to
work harder ... They have said to the deans
that, 'We need everybody here to know that
this is our number one priority."'
While May said raising money for "peo-
ple" was something that donors have always
been interested in, Richard Rogel, the Michi-
gan Difference campaign vice chair, said gar-
nering support for scholarships before that
campaign was extremely difficult.
"If you had asked me two campaigns ago, I
would have said it was very difficult to raise

for a new generation of philanthropists.
"The Michigan Difference was the cam-
paign previously, but no (students) knew that
was a campaign," Becker said. "We really
wanted to get students involved and know
what's going on and know that it has an
impact on them."
The committee works closely with the office
of Development - which has made sure that
the students on the committee have had plenty
of face time with donors as well. Lastsemester,
the office of Development quietly held a plan-
ning event in Crisler Center with some of the
University's biggest donors, including Stephen
Ross, Penny Stamps and Richard Rogel.
"Recent alum support is pretty low for
U-M, even compared to other institutions,"
Becker said. "I hope that since this campaign
is showing that U-M is going to help ... future
students, hopefully that will increase morale

And those were the good days.
Today, state appropriations make up only
17 percent of the general budget - the money
used to pay most instructors, cut the grass and
keep the lights on. Over the course of the last
decade, the state's appropriation for the Ann
Arbor campus has fallen from about $363 mil-
lion in fiscal year 2002-2003 to $279,108,000
in fiscal 2013-2014 in nominal dollars. In real

The manwho makes the money
The man who leads the University's devel-
opment activities is no stranger to a chal-
lenge. May began his career in fundraising
in 1979 - when the University's fundraising
staffwas on half of the top floor of the Student
Activities Building.
Today, there are 550 people working in
development at all three University cam-
puses and across the nation. Nearly 175 of
those people are full "development officers"
- those that go out and engage with donors
directly. May oversees all of them.
May graduated with an English degree from
Michigan's HopeCollegebefore earningamas-
ter's degree from the University ofVermont.In
his mid 20s, he served asa dean of students for
New England College before applying to the
University for a doctorate in Higher Educa-
tion Administration. While he was wrapping
up his studies, a job in the University's nascent
development operation opened up. Since his
wife was already workingin student affairs,he
decided to try something different.
It worked.
"It was absolutely the perfect fit," May said.
"I tend to remember names, I tend to remem-
ber people, I love meeting strangers, I love
relationshipbuilding, and I'mnot afraid to sell.
I'm not embarrassed sbout asking people. The
vast majority - most people are. Not every-
body likes to ask people to give away money."

May said when he began in the fall of
1979, the University's endowment was less
than $150 million and development raised
between $15 to 30 million per year - a far cry
from the hundreds of millions raised annu-
ally in the last decade. According to Judith
Malcolm, senior director of the University's
executive communications, last year the Uni-
versity brought in $357 million in cash dona-
tions, and many millions more in pledges to
be paid over coming years.
Historically, private schools have a stron-
ger tradition in development than public
institutions, which usually benefitted from
strong and growing state support. Faced with
economic hardship and budget reprioritiza-
tions, many states have gradually reduced
the amount they spend funding flagship state
institutions, often reallocating funds to tech-
nical schools and community colleges.
The University saw a major revamp in
development practices in the early '80s
under the stewardship of Jon Cosovich, a
vice president for development recruited
from Stanford University.
At his first meeting with the staff, Coso-
vich laid out his plans for the University's
development: focus on transformational
gifts, not incremental ones. At the time, that
was $100,000 or above.
"The room was silent, everybody went
'$100,000?'" May said. "You know, at that
point, it was scary to think that was all you

Building a tradition of giving back is one of
May's long-termgoals.Eventhough the Univer-
sity has the seventh largest endowment in the
nation, which thisyear totaled $8.4billion, the
University's Office of Public Affairs estimated
that it ranked 101st on a per-studentbasis.
As an example, in 2011-2012, Harvard's $30
billion endowment amounted to about $1.43
million per student. In the same period, the
University's endowment was valued at about
$7.6 billion - or $174,000 per student.
"Endowment gifts have a benefit in per-
petuity versus an expendable gift," said Tim
Slottow, the University's chief financial officer.
"Which is wonderful - and we desperately
need expendable gifts for professorships and
financial aid -but an endowment actually pro-
vides support in perpetuity, and he gets that."
The goals for the University's next fund-
raising campaign, Victors for Michigan, are
expansive. Finding support for research and
progressive learning techniques are at the
top of the list. A billion dollars for student
aid, a billion dollars for the hospital system
and $400 million for the Ross School of Busi-
ness are among the more targeted goals.
Looming behind it all is the endowment - a
gift that keeps on giving. The Michigan Dif-
ference campaign raised between $925-940
million for the endowment.
Victors for Michigan will be May's fourth

the enormous decline in state appropriations
and a national recession - some considerable
tuition increases notwithstanding. However,
with the budget increasingly squeezed to
maintain only what already existed, the flex-
ibility to invest in new projects and endeavors
became increasingly difficult.
Out of the crucible of year-over-year
declines in state support, the need for external
and voluntary support rapidly became more
than a luxury - it was a necessity. Though
a refocusing on development was under-

2000s, it gained anewsense of urgency.
