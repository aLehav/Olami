In a Thursday morning
press conference, the league
announced the Winter Classic at
the'Big House and the inaugural
Hockeytown Winter Festival,
which will be held at Comerica

Tigers.
"The NHL in the Big House

son of Tigers and Red Wings
owner Mike Illitch.

approved a proposal to lease
Michigan Stadium to the NHL

ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
Nursing School,
Peace Corps start
joint grad program

New master's
degree to be offered
this fall
By K.C.WASSMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
After serving as the site
where then Senator John F.
Kennedy announced his inten-
tions to create the Peace Corps
more than Soyears ago,the Uni-
versity is yet again proving to be
a leader in international service
as it will partner with the Peace
Corps to develop a new collab-
orative nursing master's degree
program.
The program, Peace Corps's
Master's International, will be
incorporated into the School
of Nursing's new International
Health concentration this fall
and will include 27 months of
service overseas, ultimately
becoming the first Peace Corps
nursing program in the country.
The University collaborated
with the Peace Corps in 2010
to create Master's Internation-
al programs in the Schools of
Social Work, Natural Resources
and Environment and Educa-
tion. The new nursing program
was added to this partnership
through an addendum signed
last December, according to a

Universitypress release.
Interested students are
required to apply to both the
Peace Corps and the Nursing
master's program, the release
stated. Accepted students will
serve as health extension volun-
teers around the world as a part
of Master's International.
Leslie Dorman Davis, pro-
gram director of the Office of
Global Outreach at the School
of Nursing, said she believes
the program will largely benefit
students, allowing them to fur-
ther their academic goals while
gaining valuable life experienc-
es through assisting others.
"(The program) enables the
students to graduate in four
years withnot only the Michi-
gan master's in nursing, but also
with two years of very solid,
hands-on, practical, formal
experience," Davis said.
Bill Nolting, assistant direc-
tor for Education Abroad at the
University's International Cen-
ter, said the program showcases
the growth of the Peace Corps
at the University.
"(The relationship) is clearly
growing," Nolting said. "I think
that one reason why nursing
and the Peace Corps itself are
interested in establishing a Mas-
ters International program is
the strength of our Peace Corps

Leafs' favor - but only slightly -
at 276-275.
The announcement also made
official the transition of the
2012 Great Lakes Invitational
to Comerica Park, instead of its
regular location at Joe Louis
Arena. Several other games will
be played on the outdoor rink at
Comerica Park by teams of the
Ontario Hockey League,'Ameri-
can Hockey League and various
other youth teams.
As in previous years, the Win-
ter Classic will be coupled with
HBO's "24/7" series, a behind-
the-scenes documentary series
leading up to the game that
chronicles the each team's prep-
aration for the New Year's Day
showdown.
"We do a reality show and
then we put another element on
it, and that's playing in the ele-
ments," said NHL commissioner
Gary Bettman. "So this is the
ultimate reality show."
At a secondary press con-
ference at Michigan Stadium
on Thursday, Bettman handed
Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon a $250,000 dona-
tion from the NHL's charitable
gifts fund. Brandon said the gift
would be deposited into the gen-
eral student scholarship fund.
The timing of the NHL's
announcement is atypi-
cal, considering that previ-
ous announcements about the
event's location had typically
been made in late summer or
fall.
"That's frankly because of the
enormity of the event," Bettman
said.
It'll take time to sell 115,000
tickets in two countries - or to
turn away the latecomers.
"Even at 115,000, we're going

to have demand for tickets that
we're not going to be able to sat-
isfy," Bettman added.
Red Wings coach Mike Bab-
cock is no stranger to Ann Arbor.
His daughter Alexandra is a stu-
dent at the University, and the
coach has been to a few hockey
games at Yost Ice Arena and
football games at the Big House.
"Football Saturday out there
is hard to beat," Babcock said,
smiling.
"(The Big House,) it's grandi-
ose, it grabs ya. The first time I
went in it didn't have fans. When
you go.in with fans, it's some-
thing else.... It'll be spectacular."
The biggest hurdle for final-
izing the Winter Classic at
the Big House was taking the
match-up away from Detroit
yet still appeasing Mike Illitch.
Ultimately, implementing the
secondary rink at Comerica
Park for the Hockeytown Win-
ter Festival and the ability to fit
over 50,000 fans in a stadium
won the owner over.
"It's going to be great," Illitch
said. "I think it's going to build
some confidence into the city of
Detroit."
"What matters to me," Bab-
cock added, "is that playing in
Ann Arbor was going to give
more people a chance to see it
and I think a bigger stage for us
to celebrate hockey."
The NHL is expecting an
attendance of 115,000 at Michi-
gan Stadium on New Year's Day,
as well as a total up to 200,000
participants and fans enter-
ing Detroit for the festivities at
Comerica Park.
"Based on what we're doing
for this Winter Classic and
Detroit, I'm not sure if anyone's
going to be able to top it," Bet-
tman said. "(That's) both in
terms of the number of events
and the sheer enormity of how
fans can connect to it."

ByZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon treasures the
record Michigan set last year,
when it hosted the largest crowd
to ever watch a hockey game
during the Big Chill at the Big
House. So the prospect of the
NHL breaking that record dur-
ing the Winter Classic must
trouble him,
right? NOTEBOOK
Wrong.
At the announcement of the
event on Thursday at Michigan
Stadium, Brandon said that if
the record falls, Michigan will
simply have to break the mark.
Again.
Yes, that means Big Chill 2.0,
though the event will probably
go by some other name.
Though the Athletic Depart-
ment has not yet initiated plans
for another game, Brandon said
he isn't content to just have the
record set in Michigan Stadium.
It must belong to Michigan, too.
"We'll digest this," Brandon
said. "We'll let this happen, but if
they break the record ... records
were set to be broken."
Brandon did not appear wor-
ried. After all, Michigan doesn't
have too much competition.
"We can only break the record
in this stadium," Brandon said.
"I don't think you're going to
see a hockey game in the Rose
Bowl."
Skeptics argue that the allure
of outdoor hockey is wearing off
thanks to a flood of such games.
The Winter Classic has become
an annual staple, and with the
Great Lakes Invitational at
Comerica Park next season, the
senior class of the Michigan
hockey team will have played an
outdoor game every season in
college.
Brandon shares those con-
cerns, but said the fans still
desire hockey in the open air.
"I do (worry), except the mar-
ketplace speaks," Brandon said.
"These things wouldn't keep
happening if there weren't peo-
ple really enjoying them."
Will Brandon be among the
thousands of those people? Not

Athletic Director Dave Brandon mentioned that there won't likely be an outdoor football game at the Big House in 2012.

if he has his wish.
The timing of the Winter
Classic conflicts with a certain
bowl Brandon has his eye on.
"I'm not sure I'm going to be
here," Brandon said. "I hope I'm
going to be at a football game in
Pasadena."
LIGHTS OUT ON 2012 NIGHT
GAME: While Brandon was in
the prognosticating mood, he
said another prime time football
game is also in the works.
Just not for the 2012 season.
"It's getting pretty late in
the game for us to be looking at
scheduling a night game," Bran-
don said. "I am just reluctant to
have a night game here unless
it's going to be really big. I think
we set the bar high with our first
one, and I want the second one to
every bit as good.
"I don't think it's probably
going to happen this next year
... (but) I bet it's going to happen
the following year." .
That's probably a pretty solid
bet considering Brandon has
the authority to schedule such
games.
Brandon cited the potential
match-up and the time of the
year as factors that may influ-
ence a decision to play another
game under the lights.
PLAYOFF? PLAYOFF?: Though
the Big.Ten has been discussing
ideas for a college football play-

off system, Brandon is skepti-
cal that any such plan would be
effective or feasible.
"I'm happy to look at a pro-
posal, I just haven't seen one yet
that solves any of the problems
that people say they're trying
to solve," Brandon said. "People
want a playoff, they want to fig-
ure out a way to determine a true
national champion, and I frankly
haven't seen anything yet that
will get you there."
The idea of the plus-one play-
off format, with the top four
teams meeting at two campus
sites before the National Cham-
pionship game, has gained trac-
tion with Big Ten commissioner
Jim Delaney recently. }
Brandon cautioned that none
of the ideas have developed into
anything further.
The athletic director said
te recognized the desire for
change, but a plus-one playoff
format would have the same ten-
sions about rankings as the cur-
rent system. Instead of teams
fighting over the No. 2 spot,
they'd fight over the No. 4 rank-
ing. And often, those teams come
from different conferences, play
different competition levels and
have few or no common oppo-
nents. ;
"I like the bowl system, I
think the bowl system is great,"
Brandon said. "You look at the

situation this year with us. We
go to New Orleans. We had kids
that had never been to New
Orleans in their life. We hadn't
been there as an alumni base in
23 years.
"We play Virginia Tech, a his-
toric program that we have never
played. That's a terrific opportu-
nity. And we go down and played
a great game and came back with
a trophy, and our kids just loved
that experience. I don't want to
screw that up."
The Rose Bowl remains . a
major sticking point for Brandon
and other Big Ten athletic direc-
tors. Any plan that diminishes
the importance of the Rose Bowl
or its connection with the Pac-
12 and Big Ten could be a non-
starter.
"If we figure out a way to
come up with some new scheme
that puts at risk the history and
tradition of that Rose Bowl, and
the relationship that the Pac-12
and the Big Ten have, then that
would be a sorry day," Brandon
said.
NOTES: Brandon said the
NHL will have the freedom to
put up advertisements in the
Big House for the Winter Clas-
sic game, similar to the ones
Michigan used for the Big Chill.
Brandon also ruled out the idea
of holding a concert at Michigan
Stadium.

YOU CAN DANCE, YOU CAN JIVE

Two of the architects behind
Ford's remarkable turnaround are
retiring, and their departureshave
intensified the guessinggame over
who will become the next CEO.
For now, Chief Executive Alan
Mulally isn't going anywhere. The
energetic, 66-year-old Kansan
is considered a hero for bringing
the company back from financial
disaster. He insisted on yesterday
that he'll continue to lead Ford.
But the retirements of two
top lieutenants - CFO Lewis
Booth and Product Development
Chief Derrick Kuzak - on April
1 remove two of the five inside
contenders for the CEO job. Their
departures have renewed water
cooler talk about who takes over
for superstar Mulally.

Gov. Snyder ties
extra K-12 school
funding to learning
Michigan's governor said
Thursday that the state should
capitalize on its brightest econom-
ic outlook in a decade by opening
its checkbook to school districts
- but only those that can show
their students actually are learn-
ing from year to year.
Republican Rick Snyder's plan
for districts to compete for $70
million in extra state money is
part of a growing trend in perfor-
mance-based education funding
as cash-strapped states look for
ways to do more than just spread
scarce dollars around.
With Michigan heading into
a new budget year without the
chronic deficits that plagued it for
the past 10 years, Snyder wants to
reward schools for how well they
educate, not for merely having the
best and brightest students. Sever-
al states have tied financial incen-
tives to standardized test scores,
but-&"der's-plan is somewhat dif-
ferent.
WASHINGTON
Pentagon eases job
limits for women
New orders from the Penta-
gon: The military on Thursday
formally qpened thousands of
jobs to women in units that are
closer to the front lines than ever
before, reflecting what's already
been going on as female American
soldiers fight and die next to their
male comrades.
The new rules, affecting thou-
sands of jobs, will break down
more of the official barriers that
have restricted the military posi-
tions women can take. They're
being sent to Congress, and if
lawmakers take no action after
30 work days the policy will take
effect.
The changes still aren't coming
fast enough for some in Congress
* or the military. They noted that
the rules still ban women from
serving as infantry, armor and
special operations forces, which
are considered the most danger-
ous combat jobs.

15 tons of meth
found in Mexico
Thehistoric seizure of15 tons of
pure methamphetamine in west-
ern Mexico, equal to half of all
meth seizures worldwide in 2009,
feeds growing speculation that
the country could become a world
platform for meth production, not
just a supplier to the United States.
The sheer size of the bust
announced late Wednesday in
Jalisco state suggests involvement
of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, a
major international trafficker of
cocaine and marijuana that has
moved into meth production and
manufacturing on an industrial
scale.
Army officials didn't say what
drug gangs could have been
behind the dozens of blue barrels
filled with powdered meth. Army
Gen. Gilberto Hernandez Andreu
said the meth was ready for pack-

on where the drugs were headed.

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann

"We know that our univer-
sities will really be struggling
with the cuts that came down
last year, and the state budget is
in a position to make up some of
those cuts, and 3 percent doesn't
really do it," Irwin said.
Irwin added that he feels

"We know that in Washtenaw

ment for the future," Irwin said.
"And unfortunately, we have had
a hard time getting that through
to the folks (in the state legisla-
ture)."
Irwin said world-renowned
Michigan institutions, like the
University, may lose their pres-
tige if they continue to suffer
from cuts.
"The luster on the crown jew-
els in our higher ed. system has
started to fade," Irwin said.
If the governor intends to
boost the state's high-tech econ-
omy, he should be investing high-
er education, Irwin said.
"In general, I'm just really
confused on how our governor,
who brands himself around
words like 'innovation' and 'com-
peting for the new economy,' can
turn around and propose big-
ger cuts to the institutions that
actually provide that benefit for
people in the state of Michigan,"
Irwin said. "Innovation is driven
by those institutions."

more than 100 speakers have spo-

Neal said students involved
in the center's programs are not
solely focused on making money,

"It's really about changing
people's lives and doing it in a
sustainable way," Neal said. "We

Neal said he wants to continue to

Neal attributes much of the
center's success to high levels of

David Munson, dean of the Col-

"It's hard to imagine a better

Harper and Coleman spoke
candidly about the University's
plans to update both the IM

University has already hired
consultants and is working
with a student advisory panel to
determine what the best course

Coleman added that a sur-

was intended to determine how
often students use the buildings,
and if students would be will-
ing to pay an additional fee to
underwrite the renovation and.
maintenance of the buildings.
"What most institutions do is
that they have a mandatory stu-

"We wanted to test to see if that
was acceptable to students."

volunteers, nationwide. Accord-
ing to Davis, it was only natural
that the University took the lead
in implementing the new nursing
program because of its close ties
to the Peace Corps.
"I think it's keeping with our
tradition with the Peace Corps,"
Davis said. "It makes sense that
we would be at the forefront of
something like this, we have a
history with the Peace Corps."
The University has a storied
history with the Peace Corps,
starting with former Kennedy's
impromptu speech late at night
to students on the steps of the
Michigan Union in 1960 as he
campaigned for president.
In his speech, Kennedy encour-
aged students to spend two years
assisting people in countries
around the world. This call to
action inspired University, stu-
dents to sign a petition pledging
to volunteer their time abroad,
which led to the formation of the
Peace Corps in 1961.
In fall 2010, the University
commemorated the 50th anniver-
sary of the Peace Corps program
with various symposiums and
events, including a 2 a.m. reen-
actment of Kennedy's original
speech.
Acosta inquired about how
the University was addressing
transportation between the two
campuses, particularly during
peak hours. Coleman highlight-

ed the fact that Harper has been
riding the buses to better under-
stand the situation facing stu-
dents living on North Campus.
"I feel your pain," Harper
said, in regards to experiencing
bus transportation.
Harper said she is continuing
to work with the University's
Parking and Transportation
Services to improve transporta-
tion for students, adding she is
frustrated by the failure of PTS
to consider ' the time students
spend waiting and walking to
the bus when measuring perfor-
mance.
"They are really clocking 'get
on the bus, get off the bus,' but
that's not the lived experience,"
Harper said. "It's leave my house,
wait, get on the bus, get off the
bus (and) walk. Transportation
is (only) clocking when the bus is
supposed to be there, so we keep
having intense conversations."
According to Coleman, the
University is currently in the
process of acquiring new buses
to alleviate congestion. Harper
said adding buses would comple-
ment existing transportation
resources, which will provide
better operating hours both on
weekdays and weekends.
"Particularly, students on
North Campus say they still
live on the weekends, so they'd
like to be able to travel," Harper
said.

Snyder's budget doesn't give enough to higher ed.
In his State of the State address last month, Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder spoke of Michigan's unacceptable 17 percent college read-
iness rate among students - nowhere near his 100 percent goal.
Unfortunately, Snyder's apparent dedication to higher education car-
ries little weight in light of his administration's actions. Last year, the
state cut an unprecedented 15 percent in funding to higher education -
totaling a nearly 30-percent reduction over the last decade. This move
prompted tuition increases at public colleges statewide. Yesterday, the
governor unveiled his 2013 and 2014 budget, including a 3.1-percent
increase in higher education funding. While Snyder's renewed invest-
ment in higher education was well intentioned, the modest increase is
only a drop in a bucket he already poured out.


[The settlement will] begin to turn the page on an
era of recklessness that has left so much
damage in its wake."
- President Barack Obama said during a speech yesterday about the $26 billion
settlement between the federal government and five major banks over faulty mortage practices.
Fairy representig miorities

The budget calls for 60 percent of Michi-
gan residents to have a "degree or credential
by 2025." The 3-percent reinvestment is sim-
ply not enough to achieve Snyder's lofty goal.
A competitive education system cannot be
sustained or continue to develop without the
state's support.
The proposed budget allocates $36.2 million
more to higher education from last year. The
University of Michigan, along with Michigan
State University, will only receive 1.4-percent
increases. The aid will be distributed based on
a four-criteria formula: growth in degree com-
pletion, the number of degrees in "critical skills
areas," the number of Pell Grant recipients and
a curbing oftuition increases.
The burden of increasing higher education
accessibility does not fall solely on the state.
The measures the budget outlines are impor-
tant factors institutions should be thinking
about. The University has shown leadership
in efficiency by working to cut millions from
its budget each year. All colleges must seri-
ously evaluate how to restrain tuition increases
while providing an excellent education.
The state doesn't have the power to force
changes upon colleges, so it's instead using aid
as an incentive. Snyder's sentiment is strange -
if colleges fail to meet Snyder's goals, decreased

funding would further tie their hands and
potentially exacerbate problems.
Tying the distribution of aid to "the num-
ber of undergraduate completions in critical
skill areas" is specifically troubling. These
preferred degrees are all math, science and -
health related.
Obviously, continued excellence in these
fields is vital for a variety of reasons. The lan-
guage - along with Snyder's entire attitude
toward higher education - seems to forget the
worth of all types of education. Pushing fund-
ing at specific programs in order to keep up
with state regulations would detract from the
University's mission. It would be wrong to sys-
tematically devalue learning that doesn't result
in immediate financial returns.
Michigan's entire education system is
hurting and appropriately investing in it will
to secure a brighter future. The state govern-
ment could raise revenue to offset education
spending by raising taxes on the wealthy or
looking closely at Michigan's inflated incar-
ceration budget.
The administration uses the budget to tout
the $385 million they've put away in Michi-
gan's rainy day jar - the Budget Stabilization
Fund - in the past two years for future crises.
Governor Snyder: It's raining now.

As I sat in a packed room on
Wednesday listening to
the University's leading
administrators,
I felt frustration
mounting in the
crowd.
We had gath-
ered for a town
hall meeting on
underrepresent-
ed minority stu- YONAH
dent recruitment
efforts. Nearly LIEBERM
every seat in the
room was filled.
Not surprisingly, the crowd itself was
very diverse.
What does this tell us about the
issue? Minority and white students
deeply care about the utter lack of
diversity on this campus and want to
be heard. There are very few events
like this one that compel top admin-
istrators to be held accountable to the
students they serve.
Unfortunately, my peers and I
were disappointed in the adminis-
trators.
During the first half of the meet-
ing, the administrators praised the
far-reaching recruitment and out-
reach programs that the University
has put into place. They discussed
pipelines and summer programs,
taskforces and centers.
To their credit, they hit all the
right points. As the mic was passed
from hand to hand, each speaker
spoke to the importance of diver-
sity ina learning environment. They
praised the University's history as a
diverse institution of learning, and,
well, you get the point.
However, a quick look around
campus reveals that these programs
can't be called successful. Either
there aren't enough of them - which
is doubtful, since each speaker listed
off multiple programs - or these
programs aren't reaching their full
potential.
Nationwide, 16.3 percent of peo-
ple are Latino/a but that number
is only 4.3 percent on campus. In
2006, 7.3 percent of students were

black, but today, while 14.2 percent
of the state of Michigan is black,
only a meager 4.4 percent of the
University's population is black.
This is a clear demonstration of the
drastic drop in underrepresented
minority enrollment.
It's true that the drop can partially
be explained as a result of Proposi-
tion 2. Passed in 2006, Prop 2 banned
affirmative action at publicly funded
institutions, including public uni-
versities in Michigan. But, instead
of being creative in the face of this
challenge, administrators are simply
usingit as an excuse.
During their opening remarks,
not a single administrator owned up
to the fact that the University is not
as diverse as it should be. They were
too busy saving face to talk about the
issues at hand.
Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the University's Office of
Financial Aid, said she believed
the University has the best institu-
tional infrastructure for diversity
recruitment in the country.
Clearly, there's a disconnect here.
If our infrastructure is so strong,
where is the on-campus diversity
that should come with it?
Only when pushed by the audience
did the administrators finally recog-
nize that something was lacking. One
student noted that the number of
black males on campus has dropped
from the 600s to the 400s in just a
few years. Ted Spencer, associate
vice provost and executive director
of Undergraduate Admissions, first
chose to blame a national trend; ask-
ing, "Where have all the black males
gone?" John Matlock, associate vice
provost and director of the Universi-
ty's Office of Academic Multicultural
Initiatives, came to his aid, introduc-
ing further doubt by positing that
the trend involved males of all races.
Then, at last, Spencer said, the pipe-
lines and programs are "not where
we want them to be."
No kidding.
Another question came from a
member of the Coalition for Tuition
Equality. This growing coalition is

made up of more than a dozen leading
progressive student organizations
on campus and fights, for in-state
tuition for undocumented students
in Michigan. The student asked the
administrators if they supported the
coalition's goal and what they could
do to help accomplish it.
'U' officials must
work to increase
diversity.
Notably, all of the administrators
said they supported the idea. Allow-
' ing undocumented students from
Michigan to pay in-state tuition - as
they do at Western Michigan Uni-
versity and at institutions in 11 other
states - would immediately increase
racial, ethnic and socio-economic
diversity on campus.
But, just as the supportive words
came out of their mouths, the admin-
istrators lamented that they could do
nothing, giving the excuse that it's
a procedure derived from national
policies. On the contrary - this is an
issue that can be easily addressed by
our regents.
After the 90-minute town hall
meeting, it was clear to me that the
administrators have their hearts in
the right place, but are unwilling to
put themselves on the line.
In the final minutes, Matlocksaid,
"Things tend to move when students
force the issue." I reject this notion.
Students should not have to organize
on campus for administrators to do
their job.
But until they do, we need to
stand up now to demand our diver-
sity before it's too late. I urge all of
you to force the issue to the fore-
front of the University.

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Jennifer Dibbern's claims
are factually inaccurate
TO THE DAILY:
My name is Eric Zech, and I'm a GSRA
working in Engineering Prof. Rachel Gold-
man's research group at the University. I am
writing this letter in response to the current
issue regarding Jennifer Dibbern and her
claim that she was wrongfully terminated
from her position as a GSRA based on union-
ization efforts.
I began working as a student for my Ph.D. in
January 2011. I worked directly with Dibbern
in the same research group and laboratory. For
the first few months, Dibbern was actually the
student responsible for training me on equip-
ment.Having worked with her for the first
eight months of my program, I can confidently
attest to the following:
1. Goldman has never intimidated her
students, especially regarding unionization
efforts.
2. Dibbern demonstrated a lack of commit-
ment to her research (logging far fewer than
the 60 hours she claims and often not showing
up to lab or failing to respond to e-mails for a
week at a time).
3. Dibbern was involved in other activities
beside the Graduate Employees Organization,
including the University's Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center.
4. Dibbern was unresponsive to e-mails
Students must make classes
more engaging, as well
TO THE DAILY:
I agree with Harsha Nahata's "Take Notes
or Temple Run?" that educators often ask the
wrong questions of students. But her column
begs the question: are today's students ask-
ing the wrong things of their teachers?
Nahata is absolutely right that professors
and GSIs have a duty to make content useful
and relevant. Students, meanwhile, are faced

from both me and Goldman, making a working
relationship impossible.
5. Dibbern didn't consistently receive posi-
tive feedback related to her research. She was
repetitively encouraged to come in to the lab to
work and missed multiple abstract submission
deadlines (over a period of many months from
March/April 2011 until the time Goldman was
no longer acting as her supervisor in Septem-
ber 2011).
6. Dibbern didn't achieve Ph.D. candidacy,
even after being a student for more than four
years. (Achieving Ph.D. candidacy typically
takes two years.)
7. Dibbern received GSRA funding through
December 2011, though she wasn't actively
working in a lab during that time.
8. Dibbern's research award wasn't based
on scientific merit, but rather aesthetic appeal,
and the submitted image was only used in the
department calendar.
The allegations Ms. Dibbern is making
against the University and Goldman are com-
pletely false and should not be passed along as
fact. It's wrong that she is making false claims
and is gaining support from many people based
on no factual evidence.
I am writing this letter on my own accord to
help inform you of the facts, because I believe
in standing up for the truth. Thank you for tak-
ing time to read this letter and I sincerely hope
it helps shed truth on the situation.

Graduate Student Research Assistant
with a great many distractions. But, there is a
shared burden of responsibility. Learning, to
use her analogy, is sadly not entertainment;
it cannot always be riveting; it's often tedious
and, yes, requires a seriousness and diligence
from students that's beyond the teacher's
control. Ms. Nahata's question to teachers
- why aren't you doing more? - sounds not
a little self-satisfied and entitled. She and
many of today's students would do well to ask
it of themselves.

Perpetuating unfair stereotypes

The most-watched televised sporting event in America
is the Super Bowl. Known for being a Sunday that annu-
ally celebrates watching one of the nation's favorite pas-
times, this year's Super Bowl commercial entertainment
publicized the ugly side of the nation's history: racism.
During one of the locally televised commercial breaks,
U.S. Senate candidate Pete Hoekstra aired a campaign
ad that currently has the Asian American community in
heated debate.
The brash ad features a young Asian woman riding
a bicycle through what seems to be a rice paddy field.
She then speaks about Hoekstra's opponent, Senator
Debbie "Spend-it-Now" Stabenow, and the} state of
the economy. Controversy sparked over the actress's
monologue - she speaks in completely broken English
with phrases like "your economy get very weak, ours
get very good." Worst is the portrayal of Asians in their
typically stereotyped role as uneducated peasants who
can't speak proper English.
The sexualized Asian female doesn't make solid eye con-
tact with the camera, but chooses to avert her gaze while
smiling coyly. The dialogue of the ad also doesn't specify
the nationality of the actress, nor which country Hoekstra
believes is taking American jobs. The ad just says: "We take
your jobs," with no notion of who constitutes "we," what
jobs are taken or low this is being done. This grouping
gives potential voters a central enemy to rally against.
The commercial plays on adverse stereotypes of
Asians speaking broken English, and stereotypical Chi-
nese music contributes to the atmosphere of the ad.
Hoekstra's campaign also put up a website that featured a
plethora of stereotypical Asian imagery and furthers the
negative picture Hoekstra tries to paint about the flow of
jobs to Asia. Hoekstra's campaign has since taken down
the website.
The ad emphasizes differences between the perceived
stereotypes of Asians and quintessential American life.
The rice paddy scene highly contrasts with Hoekstra's
ambiance during his'monologue, attempting to mirror a

more refined fireside chat with voters. The contrast of a
young, unrefined Asian woman with that of an ambitious
American politician depicts various forms of racism, sex-
ism and socioeconomic discrimination.
Hoekstra is blatantly attempting to prey on the grow-
ing fears of Asian economic dominance. In the state of
Michigan, the Asian American community has also been
deeply affected by the economic struggles and job losses
of the recession. It's sad to see a politician use campaign
tactics reminiscent of the McCarthy era to make a state-
ment. The anti-Asian sentiment that Hoekstra sews is
offensive and wrong.
Hoekstra has refused to issue an apology for the ad,
and has paid for it to run in Michigan for the next two
weeks. He has taken the firestorm of criticism and con-
tinues to defend himself against allegations of racism. In
an interview with CNN on Monday, he stated, "I don't
think there's any element of [racism] at all ... The only
stereotyping is of liberal Democrats and their spending
policies." But the majority of the discussion surrounding
the ad focuses on its overtly racist sentiment, not on the
policy Hoekstra is proposing. Regardless of the audience,
the commercial is racially charged in its setting, message
and tone.
This viewpoint has been written with the intent of
bringing attention to the importance of fighting racial
stereotypes and their portrayal in the mass media. It's the
mission of the United Asian American Organizations to
work in unity against instances of racism, discrimination
and prejudices. We encourage all students to notice the
subtle racist messages in all publicized materials, espe-
cially looking out for propaganda fromleading politicians
during this election year. Regardless of political affilia-
tion, it's unacceptable for a politician to run for public
office by relying on racism and xenophobia. After all, we
are a country made up of outsiders.

Critics have rebuked past
productions of the play for
exposing youth to nudity and
sexuality. Some have even tried
to censor the show, claiming it
presents an immoral message
that should not be brought to
the stage. Tulip explained how
Wedekind's play was banned in
Germany at the end of the 19th
century, and today we are still
debating the same issues - little
has changed.
"We still have discussions in
the media (about) whether teen-
agers should have access to con-
traception or birth control, and
that discussion is still going on
*and some adults are still' upset
and don't want it in the schools,"
Tulip said. "And sometimes,
education is compromised by
people's belief systems."
From this perspective, when a
topic is controversial, it becomes
even more important to bring it
to people's attention. "Spring
Awakening" will attempt to
awaken audience members' to
the problems of teens and it will
flower a perspective on how to
address those issues.

By JONATHAN ODDEN
DailyArts Writer
In the study of language, the
idea that form encases content
like a vessel had been a last-
ing supposition, unchallenged
until Viktor Shklovsky and the
Russian Formalists put forth
the radical notion that such a
relationship need not exist. The
revision of that Hermeneutic
standard was, in many ways, the
biggest contribution of Russian
Formalism and is still widely
supported today by a range of
literary theories. I suggest, how-
ever, that their argument was
wrong since it splits form from
a binary that never existed, and
more importantly, isolates form
from language. To make sense of
that, we might first re-evaluate
our working definitions of con-
tent and form.
It's unfortunate how often
the term "form" is thrown about
and how widely literary theo-
rists define it. Nothing is more
telling of this tendency than
the fact that Shklovsky's essay
- the very piece from which
form in the Formalist argument
really became defined - has
been translated as both "Art as
Form" and "Art as Technique."
This looseness of term is frus-
trating, but mistakes between
matters of form and format are
actually detrimental to critical
theory. Form is the technique,
the literary device, the rhythmic
pattern, etc. that exist in a work.
Together, these forms are codi-
fied into a static format, which,
to avoid confusion, we might
substitute with a synonym:
style. We might think of atoms
as form and molecules as style,
especially since this explanation
demonstrates that combinations
of the same forms in different
ways can create different styles.
To use a concrete example: Iam-
bic Pentameter is the form of the
Shakespearian sonnet and the
Spenserian sonnet - they use
the same rhythmic form but a
different form of rhyme-pattern.
With form defined as such,
we find a slight issue facing us

'M' welcomes Illinois to Crisler

Michigan tramples
Huskers in Lincoln

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
After the Nebraska men's bas-
ketball team showed no spark
against Michigan on Wednesday,
it would seem that the women's
team would be looking for revenge
against the
Wolverines MICHIGAN 63
just a day NEBRASKA 52
later.
But the Cornhuskers couldn't
muster a basket during a 14-min-
ute cold streak in the first half of
an eerily similar performance to
their male counterparts in Lin-
coln. The Wolverines upset No. 13
Nebraska, 63-52.
The stellar defense of Michigan
held Nebraska, to a season-low 12
points and 13-percent shooting in
the first half, while the Wolverines
hit 12-of-21 of their first-half shots
and were up by 20 after the first
stanza. Reynolds hit one of her
four 3-pointers to open the sec-
ond half, and again the Wolverines
went on a run.
The halftime lead was extend-
ed to 27, and though the Huskers
tried to come back a couple times
late in the second half, Michigan's
lead remained in double digits - a
safe margin even against a ranked
opponent.
Four Michigan players scored
in double digits, and Reynolds
matched her season-high of 16
points. Senior guard Courtney
Boylan had 14, junior forward
Rachel Sheffer had 13 and junior
guard Nya Jordan had 11.
There was one issue in Michi-
gan's play that allowed the
Huskers to pull within eight -

turnovers. The Wolverines gave
up the ball 24 times.
"We turned it a lot over at the
end," said Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth. "That was a little dis-
appointing. (But) we had a big
enough lead, a big enough cush-
ion, and we came away with the
win."
The Michigan team's outstand-
ing rebounding efforts were also
a factor, and the Wolverines held
the Huskers to one-shot posses-
sions on most of their trips down
the court by hauling in 38 defen-
sive rebounds.
Jordan recorded a double-dou-
ble, reeling in 10 boards, while
Sheffer won the rebounding battle
in the paint against Husker soph-
omore Jordan Hooper with eight.
For just the ninth time all season,
the Wolverines outrebounded
their opponent.
Rebounding is something the
team has prioritized all season,
and the 48-30 advantage on the
boards was one of many reasons
Michigan was successful in com-
pleting the upset.
Those runs - the largestbeing a'
17-0 streak in the first half - gave
the Wolverines enough of a cush-
ion to fight off a rallying effort by
Nebraska, which was backed by
a crowd eager to see the Huskers
pull out the win.
Thursday night's win gave
Michigan its second win over
a ranked team this season and
its first big win on the road. The
Wolverines needed a win in Lin-
coln to prevent a losing skid after
dropping a close match at home on
Sunday to Michigan State.

game?
This Sun-
day, the Michigan men's basket-
ball team welcomes the Fighting
Illini to Crisler Center for their
first matchup of the season, and
the outcome may very well be
decided by which Illinois team
comes to play.
But as streaky as the Fighting
Illini (5-6 Big Ten, 16-8 overall)
have been this season, they do
have a constant in junior guard
Brandon Paul, who has been one
of the most reliable backcourt
players in the Big Ten this sea-
son. His shooting hasn't been the
most efficient, knocking down
just 39 percent of his shots from
the field, but he leads his team
in scoring and typically gets the
ball in key situations.
Against the Buckeyes last
month, Paul tallied an epic 43
points on 8-of-10 shooting from
behind the arc despite being con-
stantly pressured on the perim-
eter. Whoever guards him on
Sunday - probably senior guard

Stu Douglass - will be forced to
play him tight for 40 minutes of
basketball.
Michigan (8-4, 18-7) will
also have a challenge under
the basket: limiting sophomore
behemoth Meyers Leonard.
The seven-footer is Illinois' sec-
ond-leading scorer and leading
rebounder, so Wolverine sopho-
more forward Jordan Morgan
will have his-hands full.
Michigan coach John Beilein
will likely play a good deal of
zone defense to limit the produc-
tion of Leonard and the Illinois
frontcourt. But the Fighting Illi-
ni are not shy from longrange, so
the Wolverines will have to find
a balance between locking down
the shooters and closing lanes to
the basket.
On the offensive end, Michi-
gan could get a bigboost if soph-
omore guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
starts knocking down his shots.
Though he is still the team's
leading scorer, edging fresh-
man point guard Trey Burke by
a fraction of a point per game, he
slipped under 20-percent shoot-
ing from 3-point range after his
0-for-7 performance at Nebraska
on Wednesday.
With six games left in the
regular season, the Wolverines
would love to see Hardaway Jr.
turn it on down the stretch.
NOVAK NONCHALANT
ABOUT 1,000: With a 3-pointer
early in Wednesday's win, senior
guard Zack Novak became the
45th Wolverine to reach the
1,000-point milestone. With well
over 500 career rebounds, he
became the 28th player in pro-
gram history to reach both 1,000
points and 500 boards.
Michigan coach John Beilein
took a moment during his post-

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Senior guard Zack Novak scored his 1,000th point against Nebraska.

game press conference to joke
at the expense of his three-time
captain.
"It's probably been the steadi-
est 1,000 points ever," Beilein
said, letting out a laugh. "If you
look at him, he probably aver-
ages seven or eight points a game
for four consecutive years. Who
does that? But he does that."
But the coach took a few
moments to reflect on the magni-
tude caNovak's accomplishment,
given where the senior was four
years ago. The Chesterton, Ind.
native - a signee in Beilein's first
recruiting class at Michigan -
had no Division-I offers before
the Wolverines finally extended
him a scholarship.
"So few young men get 1,000

points," Beilein said. "They've
got to have great perseverance
and the opportunity to play when
they're young.
"He's wonderful to coach. And
if he's got a thousand points, he's
also got a million points just in
leadership that he shows over
time."
The milestone,however,didn't
faze Novak. He even shrugged
off compliments from teammates
and coaches, prompting Beilein
to call him a "very interesting
young man" for not caring about
his achievement.
To Novak, the feat just wasn't
very impressive.
"Now, if I got 2,000 points,"
he remarked to one team official,
"that'd be something."

Michigan-Michigan State rivalry series takes center stage

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Luke Moffatt didn't mince
words when talking about the
Michigan hockey team's rivalry
with Michigan State.
"You want to kill them," the
sophomore forward said bluntly
on Monday. "You hate them."
Those sentiments might be a
little extreme.
But all of the Wolverines take
the underlying meaning of Mof-

fatt's words to
heart: the game
against the
school down
the highway is
circled in red
on the calendar
every year. It's a
big deal.
To No. 4
Michigan,

standings on the line this week-
end - it's about respect and
bragging rights.
So, the mood at practice this
week was a little different. As
Moffatt puts it, Michigan State
weekend demands "just that lit-
tle bit extra" from the team.
But perhaps nobody places
more importance on this week-
end than Michigan coach Red
Berenson, who has seen the
rivalry both from the ice and the
bench.

"(As a player), winning the
games was huge," Berenson said.
"I remember they were eml-
tional, physical and hard-fought.
When I got back here as a coach,
our team would always play bet-
ter against (Michigan State) than
anyone else."
In some ways, there's no bet-
ter time for the Wolverines to
take on the 17th-ranked Spar-
tans. Michigan has cruised up to
third in the CCHA standings and
is sitting comfortably in second

place in the national Pairwise
Rankings.
But the Wolverines' recent
success has come at a price, and
the first game in the series will
be played without junior forward
Chris Brown.
Michigan has had a string of
two intensely physical and emo-
tional series - so physical, in
fact, that Brown is suspended
for Friday's game for brawling
in last weekend's Miami (Ohio)
series.

But Berenson was insistent
that the Wolverines and Spar-
tans have too muchv'seSrneet for
each other to get carried away by
emotions this weekend.
The last time the teams met,
they combined for a total of 12
penalty minutes - hardly any
in comparison to the 52 minutes
that Michigan alone spent in the
box last Saturday.
"They're hard-fought games,
but you don't get the stupidity,"
Berenson said.
"It just seems that when we
play Michigan State, there's a
rivalry edge that you get to and
then you just stay there - you
don't go any further.
Moffatt will take Brown's spot
on the top line in Friday's match-
up, skating with senior David
Wohlberg and freshman Alex
Guptill.
According to Berenson, Mof-
fatt is "the right guy" to put
there - the confidence and poise
he displayed when Michigan
last trekked to East Lansing in
December instilled a sense of
confidence in the coach.
And having Berenson's
approval means the world to
Moffatt.
"It's great that coach has a
trust in me and he can throw me
up there," Moffatt said. "(Playing
on the top line) is a great chal-
lenge. It's something I've been
looking forward to, something to
strive for."
Moffatt will only have to play
one game in front of a hostile
Munn Ice Area crowd this week-
end, though, as Michigan forfeits
a home game to play at Joe Louis
Arena, home of the Detroit Red
Wings, on Saturday.
The last time the Wolverines
and Spartans met in Detroit, on
Dec. 30, Michigan walked away
with an overtime win in the
finale of the Great Lakes Invita-
tional.
But the Wolverines don't have
to think twice about giving up a
comfy-home game in lieu of play-
ing at Joe Louis.
Playing in professional facility
has a magnetic draw for the play-
ers, especially when the crowd
is evenly split between the two
teams.
"Any time you play in an
NHL arena ... it's really nice,"
said fifth-year senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick. "You're grow-
ing up and watching the NHL
games .. anytime you can play
in a good match-up in the Joe,
those are always fun."

How the 2013 Winter Classic came to Ann Arbor

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - The inaugural
meeting between the Toronto
Maple Leafs and Detroit Cou-
gars took place on Jan. 4, 1927 at
Border Cities Arena in Windsor,
Ontario. The arena - nicknamed
"The Barn" - was the Cougars'
first home.
Detroit, which later assumed
the Red Wings moniker, was
waiting on the construction of its
next home, Olympia Stadium -
coined "The Old Red Barn."
While the Cougars and Maple
Leafs tangled on the other side
of the Detroit River, Michigan
Stadium was being built just 40
miles to the west, set to host its
first game less than nine months
later.
Eighty-six years later, again
on the first Tuesday in January,
Toronto and Detroit will face off
again.
But this time, it'll be differ-
ent. It won't be at a barn, it'll be
at the Big House. On Thursday,
the National Hockey League
announced that the 2013 Winter
Classic will be held at Michigan
Stadium, featuring two of the
Original Six teams.
The Maple Leafs hold the edge
in the all-time record by the
slimmest of margins - 276-275.
At one point in 1986, the teams
also met at Yost Ice Arena for a
preseason game, which ended in
a 4-4 tie.
To break the deadlock nature
of the rivalry, the competition is
going outside. NHL commission-
er Gary Bettman called the Win-
ter Classic the "ultimate rubber

match."
But how the Winter Classic
came to Ann Arbor is a longer
story.
It began with The Big Chill
at the Big House, a Dec. 11, 2010
matchup between Michigan and
Michigan State. The event drew
a world-record shattering crowd
of 104,173 - the average atten-
dance for the Winter Classic is
53,045.
The wheels were turning for
Bettman and Co., who wanted
a chance to reclaim the biggest
stage in hockey for themselves.
Then, on the day after Thanks-
giving, Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon fielded a call
from the NHL.
"The question was: 'Would you
consider it?' " Brandon recalled.
"My response was: 'We'll consid-
er anything."'
His mind was elsewhere,
though. The next day was what
Brandon referred to as "a small
football game" - Michigan-Ohio
State footbal'
In Toronto, it was Brian
Burke, Maple Leafs president
and general manager, who took
a phone call from the commis-
sioner's office.
"Can you sell 40,000 tickets?"
league officials asked.
"Give me 48 hours," Burke said.
If Toronto could produce
those kind of numbers, the crowd
would be evenly split. They went
back to Burke.
"Can you sell 50,000?" they
asked.
Again, Burke responded with
confidence.
"Give me 72 hours," he said
firmly.

Toronto was in. The roadblock
was coercing Red Wings and
Detroit Tigers owner Mike Illitch
into allowing the league to host
the Winter Classic at a site other
than Comerica Park, the home of
the Tigers.
Comerica Park was a perfect-
ly suitable venue. But the NHL
wasn't looking for suitable. It
wanted a spectacle.
After discussions with the
NHL, the Illitch family and Red
Wings agreed to host the inaugu-
ral Hockeytown Winter Festival
in Detroit, in lieu of the game.
The festival will feature the Great
Lakes Invitational and a host of
other games and events at a rink
stretched across the infield at
Comerica Park.
"We want to make this big in
terms of attendance at the Big
House, but big in terms of trying
to involve as many different peo-
ple as possible," said Red Wings
general manager Ken Holland.
"(The Illitches) are passion-
ate about the city of Detroit. But
they're also passionate about
the NHL. Taking our team, our
brand, our league on the biggest
stage to try and promote our
game is a win-win."
Brandon brought John Collins,
the NHL's chief operating offi-
cer, and a handful of Michigan
and Red Wings staffers to the Big
House in early December to dis-
cuss logistics.
The rain pounded on the day
they visited - not a pleasant open
house for the Big House.
"We walked down to the end
of the tunnel and the sheets of
water were pouring down on the
tunnel, so we never even came

Alumni of the Toronto and Detroit clubs shared their thoughts at a press contereoce at Comerica Park in Detroit.

out on the field," Brandon said.
"But they peeked, and thankfully
we were up in the club area. And
they really got a sense for what
we had here.
"We talked a lot about the Big
Chill and how we did what we
did. And then it was a function
of, could we come up with an
arrangement where the econom-
ics were right and the logistics
could be managed and we could
kind of jump through all the
hoops? (And) we did."
Among those discussions,
Brandon highlighted the debate
over allowing alcohol in the Big
House.
Though not permitted at any
home football games, the NHL's
Michigan Stadium lease will
allow alcohol sales in the sta-
dium.

Brandon also cited the difficul-
ty of maintaining a professional-
level ice rink on the Big House
turf, even after the success of the
Big Chill, saying it takes a lot of
"infrastructure and power and
maintenance and preparation."
"This stadium is normally
mothballs and closed up toward
the end of November until the
following spring," Brandon said.
"It became a part of activating
a stadium on a holiday, when
school is closed and a lot of peo-
ple are gone.
"There were more moving
parts than I thought there were
going to be when we first started
talking."
Bettman emphasized that
Brandon's patience and attention
to detail were invaluable in the
entire process, from November

to Thursday's press conferences.
"When you're dealing with an
event of this magnitude, there
are always going to be issues,"
Bettman said. "But we couldn't
have done this without Dave
Brandon."
With the contract signed and
professional hockey officially
coming to the Big House in the
2013 Winter Classic, it's time
for reactions. Brandon said he
received hundreds of comments
- and only one of them negative.
One guy sent me an e-mail
and said, 'Shame on you,' Bran-
don said. "It was a three-word
e-mail."
With a crowd of 115,000
expected when the Maple Leafs
and Red Wings skate at the Big
House, one detractor isn't too
hard to ignore.

GLI heads outdoors in Detroit

Red Wings marvel at Big
House in Thursday visit

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Until very recently, Red
Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk
had never stepped inside Michi-
gan Stadium despite playing all'
10 of his NHL seasons in Detroit.
American football isn't too
popular in Datsyuk's native Rus-
sia.
On Thursday afternoon, Dat-
syuk walked out of the tunnel
normally reserved for those
wearing winged helmets and
cleats and onto the field at the
Big House, where he marveled at
the expansive bleachers that the
NHL is hoping can fit upwards
of 115,000 people on New Year's
Day for the 2013 Winter Classic.
Jan. 1, 2013 is going to be an
experience that even one of the
world's best players is excited
for.
"My first reaction was to pick
up the phone and call Russia to
tell people, 'You need to be here,'
" Datsyuk said. "It's going to be
unbelievable, it's a feeling you
can't explain - like a big, big
holiday."
During Michigan Athletic-
Director Dave Brandon's official
announcement that the game
will pit two of the NHL's Origi-
nal Six teams - the Toronto
Maple Leafs and Detroit -
against each other, Datsyuk and
Henrik Zetterberg were whis-
pering to each other and gazing
up at the luxury suites hundreds
of feet up.
Later on, Datsyuk took his
stick and ran around the artifi-

cial turf, flipping an imaginary
puck towards the goals that
had been set up on the field and
pointing out to his teammates
where the blue lines should be.
Datsyuk is already preparing
for a game that's 11 months away.
"I can't even imagine how it is
goingto be," Datsyuk said. "I like
the Winter Classic, I like to play
outside like when we were kids
- I love it."
Unlike Datsyuk, goaltender
Jimmy Howard has been to quite
a few Michigan football games.
He went to nearby Pioneer High
School when he played for the
United States Development
Team, and he trios to go at least
once a year.
"They're always fun," Howard
said. "I like to get here a little bit
early to watch the people funnel
in here and see how quickly this
place fills up. It really is amaz-
ing."
Even without fans in atten-
dance, the scene was a bit surreal.
In the same spot where Michi-
gan junior quarterback Denard
Robinson makes defenders look
foolish, Zetterberg laughed at
questions regarding a Red Wings
banner for the players to slap as
they exited the tunnel.
Zetterberg looked down and
gathered little rubber pellets on
the stick from the field's artificial
turf.
Like Datsyuk, Zetterberg was
already starting to think about
the game. Breaking the atten-
dance record - or attempting to
break it - for most spectators at
a hockey game will inspire that

type of reaction.
"It's too bad it's almost a year
away," Zetterberg said. "You
almost want to do it in a week
or two. It'll be exciting. We were
all fired up when we heard the
rumors, we were really hoping it
would happen.
"In the last few days, when
we knew, it was hard to keep it a
secret"
Of course, participating in the
Winter Classic means partici-
pating in "24/7", HBO's reality
show that follows the two teams
around in the weeks leading up
to the game.
The prospect of dealing with
an ever-present camera drew
mixed reviews.
"I don't mind it, I think it will
be fun being on HBO," Howard
said. "I like to tune in and see
behind the scenes of other clubs,
and I think the fans enjoy it too."
Added Zetterberg: "I talked to
some other guys that have been
through the experience, and
they said you get used to it after
a while."
In his choppy English, Dat-
syuk dropped a hint to the pro-
ducers of the show, saying that
following him around with a
camera would remind the view-
ers of a silent film.
It's all part of the price you
pay when playing in the biggest
game in NHL history.
"It's a cross-border thing with
two Original Six teams that have
a great rivalry already," said Red
Wings coach Mike Babcock.
"You've got two countries excit-
ed. We're fired up."

DETROIT - The Great Lakes
Invitational will deviate from
tradition this December. Instead
of playing at Detroit's Joe Louis
Arena, teams will travel from all
ends of Michigan and convene at
Comerica Park.
That's right - for the first
time in its storied history, what
Red Wings netminder Jimmy
Howard called one of college
hockey's most prestigious holi-
day tournaments will move out-
doors.
At a Thursday morning press
conference in the ballpark's
Tiger Club, Christopher Ilitch,
son of Red Wings and Tigers
owner Mike Ilitch, formally
announced that the semifinals of
the event would mark the first-
ever hockey games played at
Comerica.
College hockey is just one of
many levels of play that will be
represented during the week-
long celebration of the sport,.
dubbed the "Hockeytown Win-
ter Festival." Other participants
include the Ontario Hockey
League, American Hockey
League and youth teams.
But Michigan coach Red
Berenson says the Great Lakes
Invitational will draw many of
the 150,000 to 200,000 people
that National Hockey League
commissioner Gary Bettman
anticipates visiting Detroit for
hockey the last week of Decem-
ber.
"I think the twist this year ...
it'll be unique," Berenson said.
"We'll see where it goes from
there.
