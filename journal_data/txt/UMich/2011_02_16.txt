Adjustments
include pension
0 increases based on
years of work
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily Staff Reporter
University administrators
recently announced changes to
the retirement health care plan
for faculty and staff that will
alter when University employ-
ees will become eligible for
retirement and the contribu-
tion to pension funds that the
University makes on the date of
their retirement.
With the new plan, which is
expected to be implemented in
2013, faculty and staff members
will become eligible for retire-
ment through a points system
that takes into account their age
and number of years at the Uni-
versity. Additionally, the Uni-
versity's financial contributions
to pension funds will gradually
increase based on the length of

service of the faculty or staff
member.
According to a Feb. 14 Univer-
sity press release, the new plan
will save the University about
$9 million by 2020 and $165 mil-
lion by 2040.
Laurita Thomas, the Univer-
sity's associate vice president
for human resources, said the
University has an obligation to
be as careful as possible with its
funds, while ensuring quality
service to community members.
"The University is under
significant fiscal and resource
constraints," Thomas said. "We
have goals to be as fiscally pru-
dent with the resources we have
as possible."
The University's Committee
on Retiree Health Benefits made
recommendations last summer
for the change in health ben-
efits during the summer of 2010,
according to the press release.
For the new plan, the commit-
tee made suggestions that facul-
ty and staff members said were
especially important including
decreasing financial strain on

Alison Davis-Blake
to be first female
Business dean
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
and MICHELE NAROV
Daily News Editor and
Daily Staff Reporter
Alison Davis-Blake, the dean
of the Carlson School of Man-
agement at the University of

Minnesota, will be the next
dean of the Ross School of Busi-
ness, according to an e-mail
sent to Business School stu-
dents from University Provost
Philip Hanlon yesterday.
Pending approval by the
University's Board of Regents,
Davis-Blake will start her term
on Aug. 22. She will replace
current Business School Dean
Bob Dolan, who's held the post
since 2001. Dolan announced
last March that he wouldn't

seek a third five-year term as
dean.
Davis-Blake - who will be
the first female dean of the
school - was formally intro-
duced to the University com-
munity during a lunch at the
Davidson Winter Garden at the
Ross School of Business yester-
day.
In an interview at the event,
Davis-Blake said there were
several aspects about the Busi-
ness School that drew her to

the University.
"The three things I'm most
excited about are the amaz-
ing faculty, the world-class
programs and, of course, the
(University) itself - a great
University with so many great
programs," she said.
Davis-Blake cited the Busi-
ness School's motto, "leading
in thought and action," as the
basis for her future plans as
dean.

The University announced
this month that the Medical
School received $368.7 million
in funding from the National

Institutes of Health during the
2010 fiscal year, signifying the
largest amount of NIH grants
secured by the school.
The University's Medical
School is ranked ninth on the
list of national institutions that
receive NIH funding, accord-
ing to a Feb. 4 University of
Michigan Health System press
release. The NIH funding -
which came from 866 separate
grants - makes up nearly 77

percent of the $481.8 million
in total funding brought in by
Medical School facultythis year.
"Our success at securing
these awards reflects the cre-

The Michigan Student Assem-

weekly meeting last night that

will decrease the number of rep-
resentatives required to serve on
its Student Organization Fund-

Assembly representatives
arrived at the decision because
attendance at the commission's

Searching for answers in cells and vessels

Q: Where did you go to school?
I attended medical school at North-
western University Medical Center. It
was a six-year honors program.
Q: Why did you decide to come to
the University?
I was on the faculty at Northwest-
ern University Medical School. I had an
endowed professorship there, but the
University of Michigan had a very sub-
stantial endowed chair for rheumatolo-
gy research, and also the strength of the
University-especiallyin my field -was
important.
Q: Do youlike it here?
I think it's a very good intellectual
environment. The faculty are very
strong in most disciplines, so you can
usually find people to collaborate with in
all the schools.

Q: What are you currently teach-
ing?
I'm an M.D., so the type of things we
typically do is teach fellows in rheuma-
tology and residents and medical stu-
dents in the clinics.
Q: What is your research about?
We study inflammation of rheumatoid
arthritis, which is a disease where the
body attacks the joints. It's turning out
that inflammation is very important, not
just for rheumatoid arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases that are known,
but even for cardiovascular diseases and
diabetes. We also study scleroderma,
a disease where there is inflammation
first, but then the skin fibroses - mean-
ing it becomes thick and hard, and you
can eventually have contractures.
Q: Are there any implications to

your research?
In both of those diseases nobody
knows the triggers, but we've gotten a lot
better in recent years in looking at what
type of things the cells make. What's
been really gratifying as a scientist is
that one can actually see therapies based
on biology in one's lifetime.
Q: What do you plan on doing with
the grant you received for your work
in scleroderma?
We have a few aims. What we are
going to look at is blood vessel growth,
which is abnormal in some ways in
scleroderma. If you looked at the capil-
laries, it's sort of an attempt to make ves-
sels, but the vessels are disordered and
deranged. They're not like they should
be. We're goingto study this process.

Senate approves 90-day extension
of post-9 11 surveillance measures

Many in Congress
call provisions
unconstitutional
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate yesterday voted to extend
for 90 days the legal life of three
post-Sept. 11 terrorism-fighting
measures, including the use of
roving wiretaps, that are set to
expire at the end of the month.
The short-term extension gives
lawmakers a chance to review the
measures that critics from both
the right and left say are uncon-
stitutional infringements on per-
sonal liberties.
The Senate vote came a day
after the House agreed to extend
the three provisions, including
two from the 2001 USA Patriot
Act, until Dec. 8. The two cham-
bers must now agree on a com-
mon approach. With Congress in

recess next week, there is pressure
to reach a compromise this week.
The measures include the
authority to initiate roving wire-
taps on multiple electronic devic-
es and the authority to obtain
court-approved access to busi-
ness records considered relevant
to terrorist investigations. The
third "lone wolf" provision, part
of a 2004 law, permits secret intel-
ligence surveillance of non-U.S.
individuals not known to be linked
to a specific terrorist activity.
Without the three provisions,
said Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee Chairman Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., "our law enforcement
and intelligence agencies would
lack important tools to protect
this nation."
But from the inception of the
Patriot Act in the days after the
Sept. 11 attacks, the increased sur-
veillance powers have been sub-
ject to scrutiny and criticism from

both conservatives and liberals
who say they violate free speech
rights and rights against unwar-
ranted searches and seizures.
"We knew we were in a very
emotional state" after the attacks,
said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. He
said the provisions give the gov-
ernment access to sensitive per-
sonal records such as medical,
library and gun records, and "can
lead to government fishing expe-
ditions that target, unfortunately,
innocent Americans."
Freshman Republican Rand
Paul of Kentucky agreed that
"in the fear after 9/11 we didn't
debate these things fully."
Paul sent out a letter to his Sen-
ate colleagues earlier in the day,
saying that in the wake of the
attacks the government "greatly
expanded its own power, ignor-
ing obvious answers in favor of
the permanent expansion of a
police state."

Countries fear the
spread of Islamic
militancy
CAIRO (AP) - The long
banned Muslim Brotherhood
said yesterday it will form a
political party once democracy
is established in Egypt but prom-
ised not to field a candidate for
president, trying to allay fears
at home and abroad that it seeks
power. Still, the fundamentalist
movement is poised to be a sig-
nificant player in the new order.
Egypt's new military rulers
gave a strong sign they recognize
that the Brotherhood, which
calls for creation of an Islamic
state in the Arab world's most
populous nation, can no longer
be barred from politics after the
mass uprising that forced out
President Hosni Mubarak with
18 days of protests.
The Armed Forces Supreme
Council included a former
Brotherhood lawmaker on an
eight-member panel tasked
with amending the constitution
enough to allow democratic elec-
tions later this year.
The panel is comprised of
legal experts of various ideolo-
gies, including secular liberal

scholars and three judges from
the current Supreme Consti-
tutional Court, one of them a
Christian, Maher Sami Youssef.
The changes aim to open the
field for political parties to form,
loosen restrictions on who can
run for president and write
in guarantees to prevent the
rampant election rigging that
ensured Mubarak's ruling party.
a lock on power.
The panel's head is Tareq el-
Bishri, considered one of Egypt's
top legal minds. A former judge,
he was once a secular leftist but
became a prominent thinker in
the "moderate Islamic" politi-
cal trend. He is respected on
both sides as a bridge between
the movements. Sobhi Saleh, the
Brotherhood representative, was
jailed for three days during the
protests.
The military is pushing ahead
with a quick transition. Generals
on the council said the military
wants to hand power to a gov-
ernment and elected president
within six months, the firmest
timetable yet outlined. The con-
stitutional panel has 10 days to
propose its changes to be put to
a referendum.
In Washington, President
Barack Obama praised Egypt's
military council for working

toward elections and a return of
civilian control.
"Egypt's going to require help
in building democratic institu-
tions, for strengthening an econ-
omy that's taken a hit. So far,
at least, we're seeing the right
signals coming out of Egypt,"
Obama said.
The potential that the Broth-
erhood willemerge from Egypt's
upheaval with greater influence
has worried many Egyptians.
It also raised alarms in neigh-
boring Israel and among some
in the United States, fearing a
spread of Islamic militancy in
the region. During his 29 years
in power, Mubarak stoked such
concerns at home and abroad,
depicting his authoritarian
grip as the only thing standing
between Egypt and a Brother-
hood takeover.
But many in Egypt contend
the Brotherhood's strength is
exaggerated. Police crackdowns
on the group raised sympathy for
it in some quarters. Government
restrictions kept liberal opposi-
tion parties weak, meaning the
Brotherhood was the only orga-
nized vehicle for action against
the regime. Public apathy atelec-
tions made the more motivated
pro-Brotherhood voters loom
larger.

In his lecture, Chandrasek-
aran spoke about the turmoil
surrounding reconciliation
between the Taliban and other
peace deals in Afghanistan. He
said constitutional compro-

Chandrasekaran also
emphasized the difficulties the
U.S. faces in deciding whether
to continue funding Afghani-
stan's reconstruction amid
America's own faltering econ-
omy.
"I spent a lot of time this
afternoon talking about weak-
nesses in the COIN Strategy,"
Chandrasekaran said at the
event. "But perhaps the biggest
weakness is the disconnect
between the desire for quick
results on the part of the Amer-

BPC and CSC. According to
the resolution, MSA endorses
decreasing the number of MSA
representatives required to
serve on the SOFC "because of
the high demand to serve on
the commission from students-
at-large and the lack of interest
from voting assembly repre-
sentatives."
Maier said in an interview
after last night's meeting that
there has been a lack of inter-
est among MSA members in
the SOFC.
"Not only was it hard to
get reps to come up, but with
the few reps we could get up
we weren't allowed to really
accept that many students-
at-large," Maier said. "So we
thought a better way to go
about this was to have a lower
minimum number of reps for
both the budget and commu-
nity service committee."
LSA Rep. Omar Hashwi,
who voted against the resolu-
tion, said at the meeting that
he was concerned the resolu-
tion didn't address the under-
lyingcause of SOFC's problems
- MSA members' failure to
attend meetings.

ica's ongoing involvement in
Afghanistan will likelybe a key
issue in the 2012 elections.
"I think one of the most
important things people can do
is to both better understand the
situation out there and also to
appreciate the sacrifices peo-
ple are making there," Chan-
drasekaran said in an interview
after his presentation.
Chandrasekaran's lec-
ture was part of an ongoing
series sponsored by the Cen-
ter for Russian, East European
and Eurasian Studies titled
"Afghanistan 2011: Connec-
tions, Communities, Crises."
LSA senior Andrea
Rondquist, who attended the
event as part of a class require-
ment, said she enjoyed the
lecture and wants to attend
similar talks in the future.
"I think he had aslot of good
things to say about what's going
on with the insurgency at this
point in time and ... how an
agreement might be reached
eventually to bring some peace
to Afghanistan," Rondquist
said. "The main thing that I
learned is that there is still a
long ways to go, and there will
still be a lot of decisions that
will have to be made that will
be crucial to the success or fail-
ure of the campaign in the end."
"Is there a problem with the
Compiled Code, or is there a
problem with the assembly?"
Hashwi said. "There's like 30
of us right here. There's not
two of us that can serve on the
commission?"
MSA President Chris Arm-
strong wrote in an e-mail
interview after the meeting
that decreasing the MSA pres-
ence at SOFC meetings won't
reduce MSA management of
funds.
"In regard to MSA over-
sight, the entire assembly - all
elected representatives - must
approve funding allocation res-
olutions presented bythe fund-
ing commissions after each
funding cycle," Armstrong
wrote. "This process informs
all representatives of funding
allocations and increases the
transparency and accountabil-
ity of the funding process."
Maier suggested that MSA
representatives might be too
busy to attend SOFC meetings.
"I think that the people sit-
ting around the table are some
of the most active students on
campus, and they are inevita-
bly busy," Maier said after the
meeting. "Everyone supports
funding for student organiza-
tions wholeheartedly on the
assembly."
Maier said the appropriate
allocation of funds was more
important than MSA's involve-
ment in BPC and CSC.
"With this I am more con-
cerned that the funding gets
done than I am with the
MSA being completely privy
to what's going on," Maier
said. "In my experience, the
students-at-large are just as
capable, if not more than, the
students sitting around the
table."

Plan changes in part to lessen tuition burden

current retirees, continual cov-
erage for retirees' dependents
and providing increased retire-
ment contribution based on
length of service, according to
the press release.
The CORHB also proposed to
offer as much time as possible
before the change was enacted,
the press release states.
The changes suggested by the
CORHB were to be made within
15 years, but revisions acceler-
ated the plan to take place in an
eight-year span, Thomas said.
Though the plan was accelerated
to immediately put less pres-
sure on the University's bud-
get, Thomas said the concern to
allow enough time for adjust-
ment wasn't ignored.
"It is still a significant amount
of notice to our staff about the
change and time for them to plan
for that change," she said.
Thomas also said the Univer-
sity held forums last year that
were open to faculty, staff and
current retirees to offer their

input on the priorities in the new
retirement plan.
"Nobody wants to make these
kinds of changes," she said. "but
we had lots of input about how to
make them."
Ed Rothman, chair of the
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs and a profes-
sor of statistics, served on the
CORHB that developed the plan.
In an e-mail interview, Roth-
man wrote that faculty mem-
bers understood the need for the
change.
"This is not very welcome for
many of us, but a necessary evil
of a poor economy," he wrote.
"Other campuses have cut retir-
ees' health care for new employ-
ees entirely."
Rothman added that he
thought the committee that put
the proposal together did the
best it could given the state of the
economy and prohibitive health
care prices.
"The constraints were real -
our economy is not terrific and
the cost of health care is what it
is," he wrote.
When examining compara-

tive health plans at other, simi-
lar universities, Thomas said
administrators found that the
University is more liberal with
their plan.
"We have been significantly
generous in (our retiree health
plan) compared to our market
peers," she said. "So we have an
opportunity to continue a quality
benefit for our faculty and staff
in their retirement, but to pre-
serve it, we needed them to share
more of the cost."
Thomas added that the retiree
benefits for some staff is paid for
by tuition and that University
is trying to control the recent
increase in tuition, which was 1.5
percent for in-state students and
3 percent for out-of-state stu-
dents this year.
Thomas said though the
plan was only announced last
week, she has already received
mixed reactions through e-mail
responses.
"They're disappointed that
we have to make a change," she
said. "but they recognize that it's
a sound approach to making the
change."


DEAN
From Page 1A
"I think we're going to stay
committed to '(leading) in
thought and action,' and take it
to the next level," she said.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman wrote in a Univer-
sity press release issued yester-
day that Davis-Blake was the
ideal candidate to lead the Ross
School of Business.
"Alison Davis-Blake is a
known leader with strong ties
to business communities," Cole-
man wrote. "I am particularly
impressed with her commitment
to international experiences for
students. Her strengths align
perfectly with the mission of the
Ross School to train leaders in
thought and action."
Hanlon said in an interview at
the event that it was held to wel-
come Davis-Blake and to give her
an opportunity to meet everyone
in the Business School.
"I think that she will be a very
active dean and she'll be inclu-
sive of everyone's views," Hanlon
said. "And (she) will want to be
out there and know everybody,
so this seems like a great start to
that."
Students wandered in and out
of the event in between classes to

say hello to Davis-Blake.
Business sophomore Michael
Cueter said he wanted to be a
part of the welcoming event after
receiving Hanlon's e-mail early
Monday morning.
"I'm excited," he said. "I
saw the event online, and I just
stopped by after class to cel-
ebrate."
Cueter said he hasn't heard
much about the new dean, but
the news he has received about
her has only been favorable.
"I hear she is very capable for
the job," he said. "I am in a class
with the (current) Dean (Bob
Dolan), and he's talked about her
positively."
Dolan said in an interview
last March that after serving
as dean for 10 years, he would
pursue other opportunities - a
move influenced in part by simi-
lar career changes by other top
business school deans around
the country.
Business graduate student
Jennifer Hu said she went to the
event because she was curious to
learn more about Davis-Blake.
"I was interested because
she's our first female dean in the
Business School," she said. "So I
just wanted to come out and see
what her perspective is and what
experiences she'll bring."
Davis-Blake's work focuses on

the area of human resources,
Hanlon wrote in the e-mail to
Business School students.
"She is an expert in outsourc-
ing arrangements and organi-
zational employment practices
such as the use of temporary and
contract workers and the design
of organizational salary struc-
tures," Hanlon wrote.
According to the University
press release, Davis-Blake has
been the dean at the Carlson
School since 2006. She earned a
bachelor's and master's degree
from Brigham Young University
and a doctorate in organizational
behavior from Stanford Univer-
sity in 1986.
Prior to arriving at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Davis-
Blake worked at the University
of Texas, Austin from 1990 until
2006- ultimately becoming the
university's associate dean for
academic affairs, according to
Hanlon's e-mail. Davis-Blake
also previously worked at Carn-
egie Mellon University as an
assistant professor of industrial
administration.
Davis-Blake said at the event
that she is excited about her
move to Ann Arbor.
"This looks like an amazingly
fun college town," Davis-Blake
said. "and I'm delighted to be a
part of it."

human disease," Medical School
Dean James Woolliscroft wrote
in the press release.
In an e-mail interview, Steven
Kunkel, senior associate dean of
research for the Medical School,
wrote that the University's NIH
funding increased from fiscal
years 2009 to 2010. He said the
boost in funding could be par-
tially attributed to more NIH
sponsorship of grants to fund
state-of-the-art hospital equip-
ment. Six separate grants were
obtained to fund more than $3
million worth of equipment, he
wrote.
The process of acquiring a
NIH grant, which researchers
across the country compete for,
begins with an application that
explains a project's potential
outcome as well as specific finan-

cial and resource needs, accord-
ing to Kunkel. Peer committees
at the NIH then review submit-
ted application packets. -
"The NIH is interested in
funding priorities and sponsor-
ing specific scientific areas, as
well as opening opportunities
to foster creative science," Kun-
kel wrote. "Our faculty spends
months putting together a
response to one of these oppor-
tunities."
Among the areas in which
the funding is distributed are
clinical and laboratory studies,
grants for training graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral fellows.
and awards that benefit beginner
researchers, the press release
states.
Kunkel noted that the Medical
School has "significant exper-
tise" in multiple areas of biomed-
ical research. He wrote that one
study that received a significant
amount funding is about how

bacteria called gut microbiome
affect an individual's health.
"We have had great success
in securing funds to study how
the microbiome can impact your
health," Kunkel wrote. "Our
investigators received large
grants to do a genetic assessment
of the various bacteria that live
in us."
Considerable funding has also
been allocated to the study of
pulmonary obstructive disease
in the lung, its mechanisms and
approaches to treat the disease,
Kunkel added.
Looking ahead, Kunkel wrote
that grants will become more
competitive than ever due to fed-
eral budget cuts.
"The competitive funding
climate has reached a critical
point," he wrote. "Every future
award will be more competitive
than we have ever experienced,
and we will be thankful for each
funded project."

Adopt eqlualit
Both partners in same-sex couples need rights
There are plenty of horror stories about custody battles
for same-sex couples. As the law currently states, only
one parent in a same-sex couple can have legal rights
over his or her children. In the event that a partner dies or
wishes to separate, the parent without legal right doesn't have
any custody over his or her children.

That is the case in Michigan, where current
adoption laws reflect the state's unwillingness
to recognize same-sex couples as parents. But
last Monday, Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor)
proposed state legislation that, if passed,
would extend the adoption rights currently
granted to heterosexual couples, to same-sex
couples and other unrepresented guardians.
This measure is long overdue and is absolutely
necessary to ensure that responsible, same-
sex parents are afforded full custodial rights
and don't suffer discrimination.
Though single homosexuals are legally
allowed to adopt in Michigan, Irwin's bill
would expand the existing law by allowing a
second parent to petition for joint custody of
their partner's child, according to a Feb. 14
AnnArbor.com article. The law would apply to
legal adoptions by same-sex couples and chil-
dren conceived through in-vitro fertilization.
Michigan has already granted second-parent
privileges to stepparents who wish to adopt
their spouse's children, but the law doesn't
recognize same-sex couples.
The bill would give the children of same-
sex couples unfettered accessato the insurance,
Social Security and other financial benefits of
both parents, rather than just one. These chil-
dren would also enjoy the stability of a two-
parent household without a barrier of red tape
that confuses their perception of a cohesive
family. Under the current system, if some-
thing happens to the custodial parent, the
child could be placed into protective custody

without regard for the fact that the child has
another parent who is simply not recognized
by the state.
As it stands, the current law doesn't pro-
vide shared custody between separated, same-
sex couples. Regardless of how longa couple is
together and raising a child, if they separate,
the non-custodial parent has no rights to that
child. Irwin's bill would protect the inter-
ests of the adoptive parents by granting them
shared custody in the same manner as hetero-
sexual couples.
The sheer lack of precedent to justify the
current same-sex adoption restrictions is star-
tling. Two separate studies - one published in
the September 2009 issue of Adoption Quar-
terly and the other in abook by Assistant Prof.
Abbie Goldberg of Clark University - found
no significant difference between the long-
term well-being of children raised by same-
sex couples and those raised by heterosexual
couples. Yet the state has a system in place that
refuses to grant a legitimate parent of custo-
dial rights, and potentially endangers the sta-
bility of the child's life, simply because of the
parent's sexual orientation.
This type of discrimination reflects an anti-
quated perception of whata parent is and what
a family is. Instead of focusing on the gender
of the partners, the state should be examining
whether or not a couple can provide a healthy
and stable home for a child. Couples who are
able to do so should be granted full custodial
rights - for both parents.

ast week I got a CTools noti-
fication that I've received
countless times over the past
few semesters: A
reminder to com-
plete my course
evaluations. The
only strange.
thing is that I
have never gott
that e-mail just Y
six weeks into a
semester. What is JEFF
even more shock- WOJCIK
ing is that while
some LSA profes-
sors provide a venue for feedback
mid-semester, most LSA professors
only offer the opportunity through
the required end-of-term online
evaluations. College of Engineering
students are offered the opportuni-
ty to complete mid term evaluations
for every class they take. LSA stu-
dents should have the same oppor-
tunity to critique our world-class
faculty and staff. And all faculty
and staff should use midterm evalu-
ations to better cater their instruc-
tion and work to the students they
are teaching.
Unlike end-of-term evaluations,
which can only create improve-
ments for future students, instruc-
tors benefit from midterm feedback
because they can augment their
teaching, if necessary, for students
who are currently taking the course.
This immediate response can help
students learn better and allow
professors to adopt a style that best
accommodates specific semesters
and sections of students. Feedback
also allows students to indicate an
interest ina relevant political topic,
a small change to lecture slides or
other suggestions that might not
warranta meeting with a professor.
Additionally, while I suspect
many instructors are approach-
able and receptive to criticism
from students, the barriers against

complaining and the perceived risk
of communicating dissatisfaction
with a course is high for under-
graduates. Online course evalua-
tions, facilitated feedback sessions
provided by the Center for Research
on Learning and Teaching or other
methods of evaluating classes is
needed to ensure genuine, reliable
criticism. Without the formalities
of an anonymous interface and rou-
tine request for feedback, soliciting
teaching advice is ineffective and
likely incomplete. Using institu-
tional evaluations of teaching pro-
vides a level of comfort for students
to take action about their courses.
As I mentioned in a column two
weeks ago, LSA rocks. I think most
people would agree professors are
largelyresponsible for makingtheir
experience in LSA a positive one.
That said, there is always room for
improvement, and constructive
criticism half way through each
semester can only make things
better. Short of requiring midterm
online course evaluations for all
courses, LSA could provide incen-
tives to faculty to conduct midterm
evaluations. Departments and the
college already take end-of-semes-
ter course evaluations very serious-
ly and use them in making decisions
about tenure, among other things.
It might be appropriate to allow
instructors the chance to add to
their record of evaluations through
the data collected from mid-semes-
ter evaluations. This may already be
the case, and if so, faculty and staff
should be even more motivated to
take advantage of the opportunity
to poll students about their classes.
Given that course evaluations
and feedback surveys are cheap to
provide, easy to create and don't
take a great deal of time for stu-
dents to complete, there isn't be
a reason not to mandate midterm
evaluations in LSA. More evalua-
tions can only improve our learning

experience at the University, and
more interaction in this way will
continue to propel the University
to be recognized as an outstanding
institution. We don't need to over
do it and have a survey after each
class period, but given how easy it
is to provide a venue for grievances
online around the seventh week of a
course, there really is no reason not
to utilize some evaluation resource
at least twice a term for each class.
Mid-semester
evaluations can
be constructive.
Of course, an increase in course
evaluations is a two-way street,
as it only helps faculty and staff if
we students take the few minutes
needed to give feedback, when it is
requested. Many students fill out
course evaluations at the end of
each term, but a handful still fail
to do so. It's our responsibility to
complain when given the chance
or alternatively indicate our appre-
ciation of professors who do a great
job.
I hope all LSA faculty and staff
will take just a small part of their
next lecture to distribute surveys,
point students to a CTools evalua-
tion or have CLRT conduct a Mid-
term Student Feedback Session.
Even if professors, lecturers and
GSI's use the exact same CTools
questionnaire they'll use at the end
of the term, it would allow them to
address student needs on a term-by-
term basis and make their excellent
instruction even better.

For Detroiters, the Chrysler commercial featuring
Eminem stood out as one of the highlights of the Super
Bowl, showing a different side of Detroit than what we
have been seeing in the media. The commercial's narra-
tor gave Michiganders reason to be proud of the Motor
City, boldly stating, "What does a town that's been to
hell and back know about the finer things in life? Well,
I'll tell you: more than most. You see it's the hottest fires
that make the hardest steel. Add hard work, and con-
viction and the knowhow that runs generations deep in
every last one of us. That's who we are. That's our story."
But Detroit headlines are trumpetinga different story.
Instead of hearing about Detroit's progress, we've been
reading about soaring unemployment and urban decay.
The sob story in the media only reveals a superficial
understanding of what is really happening in Detroit. For
reporters, it's easy to keep up the image of destruction
- anyone can go to Detroit and find abandoned houses
and decaying buildings. But personally, I'm tired of hear-
ing about Detroit's disrepair. I'd like to hear more about
what people are doing to put the city back on its feet.
More and more young innovators are moving to Detroit
to help with community revitalization. It seems that the
younger generation is able to see creative opportunity in
a place that others regard as rough around the edges.
As University students, we have a vested interest in the
revival of Detroit. The University offers academic pro-
grams to students who want to experience Detroit first-
hand. Semester in Detroit is a University program that is
co-sponsored bythe Residential College and the Ginsberg
Center for Community Service and Learning. Students
who enroll in SID live in the Detroit community for-one
semester, taking classes at Wayne State University and
interning at Detroit non-profit organizations. Many of
these University students have formed lasting bondswith
the city - in the first two years of the program, 50 percent
of seniors involved in the program moved to Detroit after
graduation to continue their work and give back to the
city. We need more University students to become per-
sonally invested in the social and economic betterment of
the city, and get to know the community outside of the
abandonedbuildings featured on the news.
University students can also play a role in Detroit's
rejuvenation by moving to the city after graduation. For
people who are paying off student loans or can't afford

expensive Ann Arbor housing, Detroit is a great option.
Housing in Detroit costs a fraction of the price of Ann
Arbor housing. While most University students love
living in Ann Arbor - despite its increasing commer-
cialization - Detroit is worth a closer look, as it's fast
becoming a place for innovators and local businesses.
Michigan artists and architects have already become
involved in community betterment through large-scale
projects in Detroit. Five young teachers from the Taub-
man College of Architecture and Urban Planning made
their footprint in Detroit by buying a foreclosed house
for only $500 and completely revamping the inside
through a series of innovative architectural projects.
The team, known as the Five Fellows, took on five sep-
arate projects in different sections of the house. Each
section served as an architectural experiment for the
fellows. The house has become famous in the neighbor-
hood and is now a point of pride for the residents. The
Five Fellows project is living proof that through creative
thinking and dedication, urban decay can become urban
renewal.
University graduates who are interested in art, archi-
tecture or renewable energy should consider becoming
a part of the Power House Project in Detroit - a non-
profit organization that inspires neighborhood revital-
ization. One goal of the PHP is to introduce stabilization
in communities by renovating abandoned houses in cre-
ative ways. The PHP offers an artist residency program
for members, providing artists with a space to live while
working on projects in Detroit neighborhoods. The PHP
and similar organizations see art and community better-
ment as an essential part of Detroit's development. The
PHP relies on young people, like University students to
carry out this goal.
Young people couldn't ask for a better place to get
started than Detroit. Detroit offers unique opportuni-
ties that a fully developed city like New York City can-
not. In Detroit there is space for redefinition - anyone
can make their own, unique mark. The city has been
broken down, but the exciting part now is the building
back up. This city, bursting with possibilities, is right at
the fingertips of University students. So students, when
planning your future, think Detroit.

Still, zombies have not become

mized in Sawyer (Josh Holloway)
from "Lost," Jason Lee tried it and
failed in "Memphis Beat," but the
torch carries on with the macho
main muchacho of FX's "Justi-

Olyphant), who - combined with
the poise and quickdraw of Dirty
Harry - is the coolest cat in acow-

Season one of "Justified"
brought U.S. Marshall Raylan

Kentucky, reassigned to a Lex-

Overall, the first season of

without depicting every inhabit-
ant as a backwoods lout (similar
to "Winter's Bone," except fast-
paced and funny). In one of the
most profound representations
of a villain since Ben Linus on

from skinhead to soldier of god.

New University
Productions show
tackles Valentines
and violence alike
By DANIEL CARLIN
DailyArts Writer
Now that Valentine's Day has
passed, it finally seems kosher
to lay off the romanticism and
chocolate.
However, Armsand
love will the Man
still be in the
air tomor- Tomorrow at

Productions Sunday at 2 p.m.
will present
"Arms and Lydia Mendelssohn
the Man" Theatre
at the Lydia Tickets from $10
Mendels-
sohn Theatre.
"Arms and the Man," one of
George Bernard Shaw's most
famous plays, is set in 1885, just

as the Serbo-Bulgarian War is
ending. Raina, a Bulgarian, is
engaged to a hero of war, Sergi-
us, who leaves for battle. While
Sergius is away, Raina finds the
Serbian Captain Bluntschli hid-
ing in her bedroom, begging for
refuge - a man more romantic
than aggressive. When Sergius
arrives home, both men are
under the same roof, and Raina
is forced to question her beliefs,
ideals and heart.
The play focuses on the
romantic and idealistic notions
of war and love.
"There is a big transition
occurring in the world when
the play is taking place," said
Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Paul Koch, who plays Sergius.
"We are moving out of the.
romantic age and heading into
the 20th century."
Ironically, Shaw wrote this
comedy as an "anti-romantic
comedy." It's akin to the day
after Valentine's Day, when
many people, after the exces-
sive explosion of romantic emo-
tion from the holiday, would
rather nullify love. In "Arms,"

Shaw wanted to highlight the
themes of war and not have a
"happily ever after" conclu-
sion. In fact, the play's title even
comes from the opening lines
of Virgil's "Aeneid," the famous
Roman saga that glorifies war
and heroism by men.
. Putting aside all that is red -
blood and heart-shaped choco-
late boxes alike - the play acts
as an interesting social com-
mentary about the cognitive
development of a host of themes
in society.
"Class struggles, war,
romance-versus-common
sense, status of women, institu-
tions of marriage," said direc-
tor and MT&D professor Philip
Kerr. "(Shaw) says a lot of cut-
ting-edge thought for its time
and for all of those issues."
Kerr reminds audiences that
the production is focused on
the play and text itself - he
describes the set as "attractive"
and almost "toy-like," though
it still retains a fairly stripped-
down essence.
"I think the ideas and char-
acters presented within the

play are easily accessible,"
Kerr said. "You are dazzled by
the language, but it is easy to
understand."
While the play is fairly
wordy, the cast imbues contem-
porary experiences into these
characters. MT&D junior Mar-
got McGrath, who plays Raina's
mother Catherine, explains that
in a scene when Sergius returns
from war, she brings into her
performance the memory of the
excitement that occurred when
Obama won the 2008 election.
"People were jumping
around and literally scream-
ing and dancing in the streets,"
McGrath said. You can use con-
temporary ideas and things that
you've experienced yourself to
understand that same mental-
ity."
"Arms and the Man" pro-
vides complexity on modern
day issues such as love and war
- making the play more apropos
than ever. Though the play was
written over a hundred years
ago, the struggles between
chocolate and ammunition con-
tinue.


JUSTIFIED
From Page 5A
embark on a routine track-down
of a sex offender, which leads to
the introduction for this season's
big bads, the Bennett clan - the
region's weed-growing kingpins -
comprised of the quietly ruthless,
180-proof, apple pie-swilling Mags
(Margo Martindale, "The Riches")
and her three sons. Jeremy Davies
("Lost") plays one of these kids, a
gimpy, surprisingly vicious-for-his-
scrawny-figure maniac. And while
it's nice to see Davies back on the
tube, he has yet to learn the art of
enunciation and all his dialogue
comes through as barely audible
whispers.
The addition of these color-
ful characters is welcome, but it
only worsens a problem evident
throughout the first season. "Jus-
tified" does a wonderful job of
developing Givens and a pocket-
ful of the more important antago-
nists, but every other secondary

character has nothing to do but
stand around as fodder for Givens
to bounce his jokes off of. All these
new inclusions mean even less time
for development of crucial persons
of interest who have already been
around for an entire season, like
Givens's boss, and especially his
partner - an African-American
woman who could spark a capti-
vating study of race relations in the
American South, but instead is only
given a few lines in the premiere to
mention her discomforting status
in thatasociety.
Otherwise, the premiere is "Jus-
tified" at its nerve-racking and
laugh-out-loud funny best, setting
off a series of intriguing myster-
ies that will gradually unearth
throughout the season - why in
tarnation Boyd Crowder is blowing
up mines, for one.
There's only room in this town
for one show - with a script as
lethally effective as a six-shooter,
first-class direction and great per-
formances of great characters, it
has to be "Justified."

"I just thought our offense was
awful," Borseth said. "I thought
our defense did a pretty decent
job under the circumstances,
though."
Luckily for Borseth and Michi-
gan, the Wolverines host the worst
defensive teams in the conference
on Wednesday in Indiana. The
Hoosiers allow almost 68 points
per game, which is worst in the Big
Ten, and Indiana is near the bot-
tom in almost every major defen-
sive category.
Indiana has not wonsince early
January, losing 10 out of its last 11
games. That one victory, though,
came against last-place Illinois.
Still, Borseth doesn't want to over-
look anyone after a loss to base-
ment-dwelling Minnesota two
weeks ago.
"You're going to have to come
out every game and play, it's avery
tough conference," Borseth said
after a game against Ohio State
on Jan. 27. "I don't think anybody
is that much better than anybody
else, or that there is that big of a
separator that you can't come in
one night and not show up with
your best effort."

As Powers said, since Bennett

a part of the game that he needs

stant theme for most incoming

NOTES: Sophomore forward
Chris Brown didn't practice
Monday and Tuesday due to
illness ... Michigan is currently
tied for second in the CCHA
with Miami (Ohio). Both teams
have 49 points.

Michigan coach Kevin Borseth knows every Big Ten team is dangerous.

Michigan is currently in fourth
place in the Big Ten, just three
games out of first. It is right in the
thick of the conference, though,
because there are three teams
within agame of fourth place.
Even though Indiana doesn't
have a great record, they still fea-
ture some talent.,
The Hoosiers are led by a trio
of seniors who average more than
10 points per game, none more
impressive than Jori Davis. The
5-foot-9 guard averages 19 points
in close to 35 minutes per game,
and also leads the team with
almost six rebounds per game. She
is the heart and soul of this Indi-
ana team, and slowing her down
will be key for the Wolverines.
The other two main senior con-
tributors are forward Hope Elam
and guard Whitney Lindsay, who
each average close to 10 points per
game. The issue for Indiana is not
its top-level players but its lack of
depth.
The Hoosiers don't have a
bench player who averages even
five points a game, even though
they have 11 players who average
more than 10 minutes a game.

Michigan should be able to exploit
Indiana's lack of a bench by run-
ning its high-energy defense that
forces alot of turnovers and tires
opponents.
Indiana also isn't a very good
defensive rebounding team, which
will be a huge benefit to the Wol-
verines offense. Indiana is last in
the BigTen in rebounding defense,
which will give the Michigan alot
of second-chance opportunities.
This in turn will help to spread
things out offensively and get its
offense into a rhythm, something
the Wolverines struggled mightily
with against the Spartans.
Michigan's struggles this year
have usually been defensive, but
against Michigan State, it was the
other wayaround. Playing Indiana
could be the Wolverines chance to
right the offensive ship, as they
should be able to take advantage
of the Hoosiers lack of defense.
"What we maybe give up on
the defensive end we try to create
on the offensive end, because you
have got to guard us too," Borseth
said before the season. "No matter
how much we stop them, we have
to score too."

Madwed and Ortiz prove consistent

By ANDREW BAUSCHELT
Daily Sports Writer
In most sports, consistency is
better than flash.
Once in a blue moon, a flashy
performance is good in the short-
run, but over the course of a
grueling season, the consistent
performances from athletes are
more beneficial to the team. And,
in the case of the No. 13 Michi-
gan men's swimming and diving
team, the Wolverines definitely
have those consistent performers.
They admit they have no super-
stars, yet the team has seemingly
dominated its competition in
individual events swum regularly
by just two swimmers - junior
Dan Madwed and sophomore
Miguel Ortiz.
Madwed, who impressed with
his 200-yard freestyle and butter-
fly finishes at the Big Ten Cham-
pionships last year, has found
more success in the 200 fly and
in the shorter 100-yard butterfly,
too. In two instances, Madwed
swept both fly events and went
undefeated in dual-meet competi-
tion in the 200 fly.
"This year, the (200) fly is defi-
nitely my favorite race," Madwed
said after Monday's practice. "It's
kind of like getting back to my
roots. I always was better at 200
fly growing up, so doing well in it
really just feels right."
As much as these performanc-
es can just be seen as consistent
point-earners for the Wolverines,
they also serve as invaluable con-

fidence boosters too, especially in
Madwed's eyes.
"Growing up, I used to just go
out as hard as I could and would
really feel (the pain) coming
home," Madwed said. "Now, I've
learned I really don't necessarily
have to do that, but instead focus
on my stroke and my abilities.
Knowing that and seeing itshow
up in the meets has definitely
given me a ton of confidence
headinginto Big Tens."
For Ortiz, the50- and 100-yard
freestyle have been his bread
and butter throughout the Big
Ten campaign. The sophomore
has garnered a top-three finish
in either the 50- or 100-freestyle
events since Big Ten competition
began in January and has sprin-
kled in impressive finishes in the
100-yard backstroke too.
"(Ortiz) has really been own-
ing the 50- and 100-free events,"
senior captain Chris Douville
said. "He's also stepped up as
a backstroker, too, so it's really
impressive to see where he's come
from since last year."
Combined with the whole
team's recent hot streak, Ortiz
has worn out the podium plat-
form with his recent perfor-
mances. Since Michigan's
conference-opening loss to Indi-
ana, Ortiz has been the firstto the
wall in the two freestyle events
during Big Ten competition and
has made a couple podium visits
for the 100-yard backstroke as
well.
If the individual performances

weren't enough to spark a team,
both Madwed and Ortiz provide
great boosts for the relay teams.
Both tankers swam a leg in the
200-yard freestyle relay at Michi-
gan State, which resulted in a new
pool-record. It was the second
pool record of the day for Ortiz,
as he swam a leg in the 200-yard
medley relay, which also bore a
new pool record.
For Michigan coach Mike Bot-
tomthough, the impressive show-
ings by Madwed and Ortiz are
just precursors to the leadership
shown outside the pool.
"(Madwed) leads this team and
Miguel is our head sprinter - a
guy who has come from pretty
much nowhere in the program
and developed," Bottom said.
"He just projects confidence to
the other guys. I feel good about
having them, definitely, but I feel
even better seeing what they do
for the team."
In the eyes of Douville, the
exciting part has only begun for
the squad.
"It's been really exciting
because we've never really had
many 50 or 100 freestylers or 100
butterfly (swimmers), so to have
the depth to compete in those
events is great," Douville said.
"You know, it'll be interesting to
see what happens and how people
go against these guys come next
week (at Big Tens)."
For these two Wolverines next
week, consistencyiskey. But,then
again, aonce in a blue moon effort
wouldn't hurt either.

JAMESWEAVER/Daily
verages seven assists and 15 points a game for the Wolverines.

The Michigan Daily: What does
your team have to do to get back
to the tournament this year?
Demetri McCamey: We need
to show more toughness down
the stretch at the end of games.
We need to not lose that mental
focus and (not stop) having that
killer instinct. That's something
we've talked about this summer
- having that killer instinct, and
putting teams away.
Mike Davis: (Play better)
defense. Our defense has to dic-
tate our offense. We need to get
steals, get runouts, get stops. I
think if we do that, we'll be a
very successful team, because
we can score the ball, obviously.
Mike Tisdale: I think what
we've been doing is really what
we need to continue to do. Obvi-
ously, last year was tough, but
this year we have a new focus,
a new energy. The new guys
came in, busted into competi-
tion in practice. Coach (Bruce
Weber) is focusing on defense
alone, and I think that's going
to help us win games.
TMD: It certainly helps in col-
lege basketball to have two big
men of the caliber that you guys
do. Mike (Davis), what have you
seen out of Tisdale in the paint,
and Demetri, as a guard, what
does it add to your team to have
that pair down low?
MD: (Tisdale's) gotten bigger
and stronger, so he's a little
harder and stronger (in prac-
tice) than last year ... He's been
showing me little tricks on how
to step in front of people, how
to swim move around people.
DM: (Tisdale and Davis) have
been playing with each other
since freshman year and have
that chemistry, that one-two
punch in the post. And they
have that high-low (game and)
that mid-range jumpshot down

pat. So that'll help give us a lot
of depth in the frontcourt.
TMD: No matter how good
Michigan is expected to be,
under coach John Beilein, the
Wolverines have always had a
style that opponentsfind difficult
to prepare for. What makes it so
tough to play Michigan, year-in
and year-out?
DM: Their shooting ability.
They'll put up a lot of threes,
and they have a lot of great
3-point shooters. Once they
start hitting them and clicking,
and getting that (1-3-1) zone
going, they're going to be that
much tougher to score on. And
you still have to stop the three
... It's just really tough.
MD: Shooting. Any given night,
if they get hot, it's going to be
a long night. They're a smaller
team - they're not really big.
You know, I have to guard
(Zack) Novak. He's a guard -
he's 6-foot-6, I'm 6-foot-9, try-
ing to run around, chasing him
off the screen. So it's a little
different, but they have great
shooters. It'll be a tough game
again. It's always a tough game
with them ... It's just really
tough.
TMD: What do you look forward
to most about playing in the Big
Ten every season?
MT: It's exciting. It's one of the
best conferences in the country
- maybe the best. Obviously,
there are some of the best play-
ers, so it's going to be fun to
compete against them.

everybody ... This is the num-
ber-one conference in the
country, so night-in, night-out,
you're going to play against a

looking forward to everybody.

20-point cushion.
A win over Illinois (6-6, 16-9)
could push Michigan into the top
five in the Big Ten standings, a
spot that would almost ensure a
postseason berth if the Wolver-
ines could hold it until the end of
the season. But the team is try-
ing to take it one game at a time,
knowing that in its past three
games, any loss could have put
them out of discussion.
With five games remaining
before the Big Ten Tournament
- three of which are on the road
- the Wolverines will need to
turn their focus to an Illinois
team that is full of length and
size. The frontcourt may possess
the most size Michigan has seen
since it faced off against Minne-
sota in late January. The Illini's
starting post contingent of Bill
Cole, Mike Davis and Mike Tis-
dale stand at a staggering line of
6-foot-9, 6-foot-9 and 7-foot-1.
Additionally, sophomore point
guard Darius Morris will match

up with another elite floor gen-
eral in senior Demetri McCamey,
who is 13 assists away from
becoming just the second player
in Illinois history to reach 700
assists. The senior is the active'
NCAA leader in assists.
"I talked to them (Monday),
and I said, 'This is the last time
we're going to talk about it, I
believe. Maybe we will one more
time. Here's where it is. You
put yourself in a position. If you
had gone 1-2 or 2-1 in those last
three games, you wouldn't be in
this position. You're in position,
the opportunities are there,' "
Beilein said. "The opportunity is
there.
"If we come away with wins,
it puts us in a better position. If
we don't, then we're not ready to
do that yet. It's like a five-game
tournament, let's see what we
can do."

BASEBALL
Blue must answer early season questions in Fla.

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
There will be no time to work
out the early season kinks when
the Michigan baseball team
steps off of its plane and into the
Florida heat on Friday.
When the Wolverines touch
down for their three-team,
three-game series, they'll find
themselves in another kind of
heat, facing a trial by fire as
they try to replace five key play-
ers from last year beginning the
toughest schedule in the pro-
gram's history.
Any baseball team from a cli-

mate like Michigan's must deal
with being on the road for a
majority of the early season.
And playing its first 17 games
away from home, the team will
face some unique questions.
Can they handle an early season
schedule stacked with teams like
No. 14 Stanford and, later, Texas
Tech? How will they replace
players like Ryan LaMarre and
Mike Dufek?
"There's several questions
there, but I think they can all
be answered," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said Tuesday.
"But they need to be answered in
a positive way for us to contend

for a championship."
Some of the answers must
come from new sources. Michi-
gan can expect production out of
veterans like sophomore short-
stop Derek Dennis and resdshirt
senior second baseman Anthony
Toth up the middle, sophomore
Patrick Biondi in centerfield,
and junior Coley Crank at desig-
nated hitter.
But young players must step
up for the team to contend for a
Big Ten title. And fast.
That means players with lim-
ited experience, like redshirt
junior first baseman Garret Ste-
phens, or no experience, like

freshman right fielder Michael
O'Neil, have little time to get
acclimated.
There are no warm-up games
and the competition will be
intense from the start.
That can be a curse or a bless-
ing.
"Coach touched on how they
might start off hot and then hit
that freshman wall," Toth said.
"They'll struggle, but that's just
how it is ... You might need a
freshman to step up and we have
the guys capable of doing that."
Their three-game series
against No. 21 Louisville, No.
22 Connecticut and a St. John's

team that some polls have
ranked inside the top 25, will
be the first time the Wolverines
have played outdoors since the
fall.
This means that the Friday
will be the team's first time field-
ing grounders off of dirt, catch-
ing fly balls and pitching off of a
real mound.
But the tough early season
schedule can provide a great
opportunity.
A few early wins against top
competition can go a long way
in terms of rankings and confi-
dence.
"We're just excited for the

opportunity," Biondi said. "We
got three top 25 teams, top 15
maybe, and that's just a great
opportunity to show that we can
play with anybody ... When we
go out, we expect to win"
Toth, who shares the captain
duties with senior pitcher Kolby
Wood, made that message clear
when he addressed the fans on
Tueday at the team's Meet the
Wolverines event.
"In no way, shape or form are
we intimidated by anyone," he
said.

PERSONALSTATEMENT

A BITTERSWEET BUSINESS
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF A
FAMILY-OWNED CANDY STORE
BY ELLIOT ALPERN

Almost five years ago, my life
changed in a way few would
ever dream possible and
even fewer could actually claim to
have experienced. Everything was
thrown into disarray - my very
social identity was transformed,
and I was powerless to stop it. Like
so many before me, I fell victim to
my father's career change. Luckily,
this isn't a story of displacement to
a remote region I can't pronounce,
but of how my father decided to
open a candy store.
First: No, I cannot get you free
candy. This is something I can sel-
dom take advantage of myself. I
don't mean to be selfish, but I can't
allow some random reader to jeop-
ardize my supply. Second: If you
approach me, chances are I will
not happen to be carrying around
whatever your favorite candy is.
I'm not a pinata. Third: I've seen
both Willy Wonka movies, and I'm
sorry if I spoil your fantasy, but as
of yet, we have neither a chocolate
waterfall nor an army of orange-
faced midgets. Get over it.
In early2005, my dad was struck

something along the lines of "This

first few times, but as "hisdadown-
sthecandystore" became my last
name, I began to wonder whether
or not that was my public iden-
tity. First impressions are hard
to change, and though I accept-
ed the role, I always wondered
who thought of me as Elliot and
who had simply classified me
as "that kid with the candy
store."
I also swiftly learned
that working for your par-
ents is extremely different
from working for an objec-
tive employer. Your parents can
call you in a scant five minutes
before the arrival of 1,000 pounds
of M&Ms (seriously, by way of
tractor-trailer), and they gener-
ally know your whereabouts for
the day, making it impossible to
claim a predetermined schedul-
ing conflict. Almost any time of

been possible without the forgive-

"If I'm only making $35,000 a
year I won't have to pay that much
in loan interest," she said. "I would
not have come here if that hadn't
happened because I could not pay
back my loans on that income."
Though the legal sector is
becoming more competitive with
shrinking job opportunities, Kahn

- were all great.

"You don't have to become a
lawyer if you don't want to. There
are a lot of other opportunities
where law training would be help-
ful in getting the position," Kahn
said. "There are some very suc-
cessful business people who didn't
go into law, even though they had a
law degree."
Zearfoss expressed similar opti-
mism for the future of law schools
and the students who choose to
pursue law degrees.
"Practicing law is incredibly
rewarding, and you also get to
feel like you're helping people,"
she said. "From this point of view,
those are the advantages of being
a lawyer even ina bad economy."

"It'svery comparable to someone

$200,000 on one hand of Black Jack
and they lose - it's like for the rest
of my life I'm going to be paying

Sanderson-Cimino said, empathiz-
ing with the disgruntled graduate
students from other schools.
While Sanderson-Cimino didn't
find the advice from the Career
Services Office to be beneficial, the
alumni network at the University
and at Carleton College where he
completed his undergraduate stud-
ies helped him secure a job.

"The alumni network can be
pretty loyal. I actually found some-
thing mostly because I talked to
alumni from Michigan," he said.
Besides seeking help from alum-
ni, University Law School students
who have a job that pays below a
certain level can enlist in the Debt
Management/Loan Repayment
Assistance Program. There are also
federal loan forgiveness laws which
erase students' loans if they work
for at least 10 years in the public
interest.
"It's not Michigan's goal to leave
its graduates high and dry, there are
programs to kind of help you man-
age debt - especially if you want to
work in public interest," Estep said.

random student interview by stephenostrowski

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred. How was your
Valentine's Day, first of all?
Sweet.
Yeah? What'd you do with your
girlfriend?
Uh I took her out to dinner. And
then ... yeah.
Where did you guys go to din-
ner?
China Gate.
China Gate?
Yeah.
OK. What'd you guys eat?
Some Chinese food.
All right. Like what?
I don't even remember man.
Were you drunk?
Uh, no I wasn't drunk.
Did you black out?
No I just don't remember.
Really?
Yeah, I think it was like chicken
or beef.
Is dinner with your girlfriend
unmemorable, or just like...
I mean it's memorable, but like
I just remember me and her not
like - it's not important what the
food is, it's only important about

the girl.
Oh that's nice.
Yeah.
That's cute. How long have you
guys known each other?
I don't know, like about a year.
Where do you think you'll be
going for future Valentine's Day
dinners?
I don't know. Wherever.
A man ofmany words.
Wherever I want.
So shifting gears a little bit,
what about spring break. What
are your plans?
I'm about to kick it in Ann Arbor.
Really?
Yeah.
No desire to go anywhere else?
It's sweet here.
You like cold, frigid tempera-
tures?
Yeah.
What are you going to do over
break? Hit the books?
Definitely hit the books. School's
number one.
Is it?
Yeah.
What's number two, and what's
number three?
What's number two? Um number
two is my lovely girlfriend, and
number three is for all my homies.

All your homies?
Yeah.
What do you and your homies
stand for?
We stand for scholars, leaders,
athletes and gentlemen.
Scholars, athletes, leaders and
gentlemen?
No, scholars, leaders, athletes,
gentlemen.
SLAG?
Yeah.
Do you guys toss SLAG around?
Like bump fists and it's like
"SLAG"?
No, it's not SLAG. It doesn't like -
it's just like what we stand for.
Is SLAG in the Maize Pages?
Like is this a student organiza-
tion?
No it's just like...
No mass meetings or anything?
No.
I apologize it's getting late. So
what do you think about the
Grammys? I heard Lady Gaga
came out of an egg.
She came out of an egg? I didn't
know that. I can't believe she
came out of an egg.
I can't either!
She's a - I don't even know.
Who did you want to win Best
Album?

Dude I have no idea.
Do you know anything?
I don't even know what the Gram-
mys are.
You don't what the Grammys
are?
No, to be honest.
OK.
I've never heard of them.
Are you at all connected to pop-
ular culture?
Uh no, not too much.
What are you passionate about?
Um ... my school work.
Oh yeah, because of scholars.
It's the first letter in SLAG.
Well it's not SLAG, it's just ... yeah.
OK. Last question. Obama
unveiled a budget - a $3.7 tril-
lion budget - how do you think
the budget will affect Little
Caesars' $5 large pizza promo-
tion?
I think the government fucks us
all. It'll probably be a $10 pizza
because the government fucking
sucks.
OK. You don't think Obama
likes pizza?
Dude, Obama doesn't even like
America.
OK. We'll draw the line there.

About 16,545 undergraduates and 13,262 graduate students
- morethan half of each group - received financial aid in some
form, including grants, scholarships, loans and work-study
programs, for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Sandra Crump, the assistant director for communications
at the office of Financial Aid, wrote

that many students take advantage of the financial aid services
offered by the University.
"We encourage all students who think they might need
financial assistance to apply for financial aid," Crump wrote in
an e-mail interview.
At a Jan. 24 University of Michigan Senate Assembly meet-
ing, University Provost Philip Hanlon told the University's lead
faculty governing body that he wants to increase the amount of
financial aid available to University students.
"The whole funding model for higher education is really, I
think, unsustainable," Hanlon said, noting increases over the
past decade in the three higher education sectors: in-state pub-
lic tuition, out-of-state public tuition and private tuition.
Hanlon said these three sectors have increases at an annual
rate of five to seven percent per year, which he said cannot con-
tinue without makinga college education unaffordable.
"This is not a University of Michigan problem," Hanlon said.
"It'l a higher education problem."
While Hanlon said he is concerned about the affordability
of higher education, Pamela Fowler, executive director of the
Office of Financial Aid, said the office is committed to helping
students obtain the financial assistance they need to reach their
educational goals.
"I'm proud of what we do," Fowler said. "You will not find
another university in the state that goes above and beyond."
She maintained that the University receives unwarranted
criticism for being expensive, and that paying for tuition is
more feasible at the University than other universities in the
state. She attributes this feasibility to the unrelenting efforts of
office of Financial Aid.
"People think the University is too expensive," Fowler said.
"We are actually the cheapest university in the state."
Crump wrote that federal financial aid is based on an "esti-
mated family contribution."
"The EFC takes into account not only the family's income
but also the number of family members, the number of family
members in college and other variables," Crump wrote.
Despite Fowler's opinion of the University's affordability,
LSA sophomore Ari Kaye said he thinks out-of-state tuition is
too pricy.
Kaye said though he thinks it's expensive, the high cost
doesn't affect him much because of his
financial status.
Kaye explained that a trust
fund set up by his grandparents
pays for most of his expenses.
Because of his financial position,
he said he doesn't care if he pays
more for school than other students.
"I don'thave a, like,bigproblemwith
it if it's helping pay subsidy for poorer
people in state," Kaye said. "That's fine
with me. I don't really care that much."
Kaye said he has an older brother in graduate school at the
University and another brother in undergraduate school at the
University of Chicago. He said he doesn't have to worry about
debt and that he has some of his own money to spend.
"I'm aware that Iam of a small percentage of people that are
just like, 'I've got everything under control,' " Kaye said.
Regardless of payment methods, every student is required to
pay a substantial tuition to attend the University. According to
students who have noticed class differences among
their peers, the ability to pay this fee doesn't
put everyone on equal economic ground.
Fulton said the YouTube video ulti-
mately calls attention to and starts
conversations about what University stu-
dents already know, whether they're in the
"Pursuit of Jappiness" or the pursuit of some-
thing else.
"We would like to point out the things that people might have
noticed and put them all together in a fun way," Fulton said.
