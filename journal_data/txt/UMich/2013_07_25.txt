CHICAGO - One coach is the
favorite to win the Leaders Divi-
sion, one the favorite in the Leg-
ends. One's interview session
drew a swarm of reporters, the
other's felt almost quaint.
For Urban Meyer, hardly any
of the questions at the Big Ten
Media Days Wednesday were
about football. For Brady Hoke,
almost all were.
The first day of the annual
event was largely about Meyer,
the Ohio State coach. The Buck-
eyes punished four players Mon-
day for off-the-field issues. Should
"Last year
we were 8-5,
and that was
unacceptable"
Meyer have prevented them from
ever being involved? Ohio State
had reported an alleged recruit-
ing violation by Florida, Meyer's
former team. Was he behind it? A
former player, Aaron Hernandez,
was charged with murder. Could
Meyer have done more for him?
Ohio State was the Big Ten's
best team in 2012 and the pre-
season favorite in 2013. Meyer
fielded 11 questions during his
televised press conference. Just
one dealt with football.
A poll of 26 writers released

Monday revealed Ohio State as
the unanimous choice to win
the Leaders Division. Michigan
edged out Nebraska in the poll for
the Legends. From Wednesday,
each team had 38 days before its
started the season. And each must
answer different set of questions
before the season starts.
The question for Ohio State
isn't whether it is good enough to
win the conference. It's whether
it can endure the distractions.
The Buckeyes had largely
avoided controversy during Mey-
er's short tenure. Then Hernan-
dez was arrested a month ago.
And then recruiting allegations
surfaced. And then the four play-
ers were disciplined. All of a sud-
den, the narrative in Columbus
had changed.
After his press conference,
Meyer went through an untele-
vised round of interviews.
"I'm so excited to get to train-
ing camp because all the sto-
rylines are gone, last year's gone,
it's time to move forward," he
said. "All the other stuff, you just
kind of..." He paused.
"Just trying to get to training
camp."
And then there was Hoke, the
Michigan coach. At his press con-
ference, he fielded 11 questions,
just as Meyer did. All but three
were about football.
In Hoke's first year at this
event, he introduced himself to
the Big Ten with his folksy fer-
godsake-laden opening speech.
Michigan was the story of the
conference. In his second year,
the Wolverines had their own
issues to deal with. Redshirt

Michigan coach Brady Hoke was all business at Big Ten Media Day on Wednesday, following an "unacceptable" 8-5 season

junior running back Fitzger-
ald Toussaint had been arrested
for driving under the influence.
Sophomore defensive end Frank
Clark was arrested for stealing
a laptop from a dormitory. How
would Hoke respond under pres-
sure?
"A year ago we were 8-5, and
that's unacceptable," Hoke said.
"It's unacceptable at Michigan.
It's unacceptable for us."
This year, Michigan was
almost boring. One of the biggest
storylines of the day was about
Taylor Lewan's diet. Hoke fielded
a question about Detroit's bank-
ruptcy. The only controversy was

that redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner said he thought
Michigan would beat Ohio State
this year.
The Wolverines open camp 12
days from Wednesday, and unlike
Ohio State, the only questions
are about the football team. They
have nearly survived the sum-
mer. But Hoke's squad regressed
last year. Once again, Hoke said
Wednesday the goal is to win
a Big Ten championship. Is the
young team good enough?
The drama for the Wolverines
will start with organized prac-
tices. It has a brand new interior
offensive line, two untested line-
backers and questions at tailback.
Quarterback Denard Robinson is
gone. The schedule is easier this
year than last, but is the team bet-
ter?
"I like how they've handled
themselves on the field and off
the field so far this summer,"
Hoke said. "I like how they've
represented Michigan in a lot
of ways. Me liking them doesn't
guarantee us anything."
Each coach was given 15 min-
utes for the opening press con-
ference televised on the Big Ten
Network. For 11 minutes, Hoke
answered questions about his
quarterback; about a child fight-
ing cancer; about his recruiting
philosophy.
"Time for a couple more ques-

tions," the moderator said, and
Hoke scanned the room. Fifteen
seconds passed. Finally, a hand,
and Hoke answered a question
about an injury.
"Time for one last question,"
the moderator said again and
again, each followed by silence.
This time, no one volunteered.
This year, for this team, the only
questions worth asking must be
answered on the field.

Detroit bankruptcy
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
After filing for bankruptcy last
week, Detroit's future is unclear as
it faces court proceedings and diffi-
cult decisions in the coming weeks.
Thursday, Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's office released a press
release announcing the city's
Emergency Financial Manager,
Kevyn Orr, a University alum,
was authorized to file for federal
bankruptcy for Detroit. Orr
implemented Order No. 13, which
ordered the city file for Chapter 9
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
"The simple fact is Detroit is in a
financial crisis," Snyder said in the
press release. "The city is insolvent
and has been borrowing money
to pay its bills for nearly a decade.
Bankruptcy is the only feasible
option to fix the city's finances and
do what is right for the 700,000
people of Detroit."

A2 citizens voice concerns
over Main Street proposal

Lewan's diet and notes from Big Ten Media Days

Football Saturday
traffic and parking
topics of discussion
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Managing News Editor
After announcing a proposal
on July 15 to close Main Street
between Stadium Boulevard and
Pauline Boulevard during home
football games, the University and
the Ann Arbor Police Department
held a meeting to address the
concerns of nearby residents.
The street would be closed for
three hours before the game and
likely open directly afterward,
avoiding obstruction of post-game
traffic. Six AAPD officers would
help with the street closure.
The Ann Arbor City Council is
scheduled to vote on the proposal
at their Aug. 8 meeting.
The University and AAPD both
said the closure, in accordance
with a recommendation from
a report by the Department of
Homeland Security in 2010, would
enhance the safety of pedestrian
traffic traveling to and from the
games. It would also decrease
the likelihood of vehicle bomb
threats by putting a 100-foot space
between the stadium and vehicles.
The streets surrounding the
stadium have seen closures for
events twice in the past: once
when President Barack Obama
spoke at the 2010 commencement
ceremony and again during the
2011 Notre Dame football game.
Two other collegiate football
stadiums - at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison and Ohio
State University - have similar
security measures.

CHICAGO - Taylor Lewan
may have lied to Michigan coach
Brady Hoke before the Big Ten
Media Days on Wednesday, the
coach says. The
fifth-year senior NOTEBOOK
left tackle has
embarked on a strict diet. He went
out for pizza in the city Tuesday
night. He told Hoke he would get a
salad, though. Temptation proved
too much.
Lewan's friends "order pizza
and wings, I look at that and I'm
salivating just looking at it, and I'm
excited about it," Lewan said. "I go
te Buffalo Wild Wings, and I order
a salad and five chicken breasts."
Pizza slipup notwithstanding,
Lewan has followed his routine
with zealous intensity. He eats 12
hard-boiled eggs every day. He
eats six cans of tuna fish. He mixes
in 12 tablespoons of olive oil. And
he can count on one hand the num-
ber of times he's broken the diet.
"He doesn't eat like me, I could
tell you that," said redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner.
The All-American, who sur-
prised many by returning to Mich-
igan for his senior season, said that
he has lost five percent body fat
since January. In the past 30 days,
he says he gained six pounds of
muscle and lost one pound of fat.
He didn't mention how much his
diet is costing him, though.
His routine goes like this: Each
night, he boils a dozen eggs. He
eats six the next morning before

his workout, and mixes three
with lunch and dinner. Some time
after each meal, he eats two cans
of tuna. He only eats carbohy-
drates (whole wheat pasta) after
workouts. And he mixes at least
12 tablespoons of olive oil with the
meat and vegetables.
Lewan cooks sometimes, but
fellow fifth-year senior lineman
Erik Gunderson assists. ("I don't
know even know what he does, but
it's like magic when he touches it,"
Lewan says.)
Hoke confirmed Wednesday
that Lewan "must have not been
truthful" about the previous
night's dinner. One reporter asked
him to elaborate on the diet.
"I can't," Hoke said with a
smile. "Because obviously I'm not
dieting."
INJURY UPDATE: Michigan's
three injured starters have shown
encouraging signs this summer.
Redshirt junior linebacker Jake
Ryan, who has a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, has been run-
ning, according to Gardner. Ryan
sustained the injury in a March
19 practice, and the team set a
late-October target return date,
which would be an unusually
speedy return from an ACL injury.
Hoke said Wednesday that he still
expects Ryan to resume playing
sometime in October.
Redshirt sophomore corner-
back Blake Countess, who tore
his ACL in the first game of the
2012 season, has been cleared for
Michigan's first practice on Aug. 5.
Gardner said he has resumed nor-
mal activities.

ERIN KIRK.ANDio.ly
Fifth-year senior tackle Taylor Lewan's diet would be enough to keep chef Guy Fieri busy, broke and lacking descriptive words.

Ann Arbor resident George Feldman, who lives by the stadium, expresses concern about proposed road closures on foo
game days this fall at the Ann Arbor District Library on Wednesday.

University Police Chief Joe
Piersante, who spoke briefly in
response to resident's questions
about safety concerns, said the
proposal was in the best interests
of both fans and neighbors.
AAPD Police Chief John Seto,
who spoke at the meeting and
answered questions, said the
AAPD supported the measure
because of the enhancement of
public safety and protection of the
pedestrian traffic.
"It is a balanced approach for
public safety," he said.
Seto added that the AAPD and
the University Police Department
would meet after every game to
evaluate how the street closures
worked, stressing that the
measure would be reviewed after
the first three games.
He said concerns of opening
the section of Main Street up to

vendors and the street becoming
part of the game day experience
was unfounded.
"That is not going to happen, we
are going to maintain control of
that," Seto said.
Some residents, many of whom
allow fans to pay to use parking
spaces in their lots, voiced strong,
often angry, opposition to both
the process of the proposal and
the proposal itself. Many argued
that the disrupted traffic patterns
would hurt those who parked on
their lots.
Ann Arbor resident George
Feldman, who owns property
near the stadium, said this same
proposalwas brought up years ago.
He said the Athletic Department
only cared about the experience of
the fans, not the homeowners who
live in the neighborhood near the
stadium.

"It would inconvenience
everyone. That's not really in
anyone's interests," he said. "It is a
better experience for their stadium
and it is a worse experience for all
of us."
Feldman said the security
concerns were simply a way to get
the proposal passed by the City
Council, citing numerous areas he
thoughtwere still insecure despite
the proposal.
"My personal belief is that this
is completely bogus," he said.
Councilwoman Marcia Higgins
(D-Ward 4) said a committee
could be formed to represent
concerned residents in the next
year or two. But she said that she
hadn't known the direct desires of
her constituents until now.
"I haven't had anyone write
back and say this is something that
(they) would like to see," she said.

Gardner also reported that
fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint recently beat
him in agility drills. Toussaint
broke his leg on Nov. 17 in a game
against Iowa.
"I guess that speaks for itself,"
Gardner said. "I feel like Fitz is
ready to go."
NO GARDNER GUARAN-
TEE: Gardner refused to walk
back his statement in June that
Michigan would beat Ohio State
when the teams meet in November.
Appearing on the "Huge Show"
on WBBL 107.3 FM, Gardner said
this year's team is one "that will
win in the Big House against Ohio
State." Some commentators took
that as a guarantee.
"I never said the word 'guaran-
teed' or 'promise,' " Gardner said
Wednesday.
He said the media had made a
big story out of nothing, and added
he wouldn't retract what he said.
"I wouldn't expect any player
from any team to ever answer
that question differently," Gard-
ner said. "And if they do they don't
deserve to be on that football
team."
DELANYFAVORSINCREAS-
ING SPENDING MONEY: Big
Ten commissioner Jim Delany
talked (and talked and talked)
Wednesday as the last speaker of
the day. His opening statement
alone went 23 minutes - 748
words longer than the longest
coach's press conference.
He made news on two poten-

tially controversial fronts. Delany
called for more money in the stu-
dent-athletes' pockets for expens-
es and for a guarantee of free
tuition for all scholarship athletes
who leave in good standing.
Delany explained that in his last
year of college in 1970, he received
$15 per month for laundry, in
regards to the expenses.
The NCAA cut the stipend in
1972 to save money.
"But now that we're revisiting
45 years later, it's never too late to
do the right thing," Delany said.
Delany also introduced his
vision for what he called an "edu-
cational trust." Under his plan,
any student-athlete on a full schol-
arship who left a school in good
standing would be guaranteed the
right to finish school for free.
"If you go professional, if you
drop out, that we'll stand behind
you so when you're ready to get
serious or when you have the time,
we'll support your college edu-

cation degree for your lifetime,"
Delany said.
INJURIES END ANTONIO
POOLE'S PLAYING CAREER:
Sophomore linebacker Antonio
Poole is no longer with the team
as a player, the team confirmed
Wednesday. Poole will return as
a student-assistant after battling
injuries for the entirety of his col-
lege career.
SCORECARD: There are no
winners and losers at the Big Ten
Media Days, but that doesn't mean
we can't declare winners and losers
at the Big Ten Media Days anyway.
Hoke wins for brevity at slightly
less than 93 words per answer. The
conference average was 171 words
per answer. First-year Wiscon-
sin coach Gary Andersen was the
most verbose at more than 284
words per answer.
Ohio State coach Urban Meyer
said the most total words of any
coach at 2,604. Delany's opening
statement alone was 3,339 words.

We can see what she sees from the

grisly images themselves. Farmiga's

ability to translate the unknown into

faith, despite your atheistic view.
An unexpected gear of this hair-

gymnastic lensing that smoothly
flips, coasts and vertigoes. One
thumb-biting scene features a young
girl peaking under her bed after sus-

By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
For years, films have risen to
success via the awkward-boy-
comes-of-age plot. But, why? Real-
ly, why?
How many J
of us can relate
to someone like 'The Way
Brad Pitt who W Bac'
saves the world Wa
from a zom- At the
bie attack and Michigan
lands Angelina Theater
Jolie (off-cam-
era, too)? Who Fox Searchlight
wakes up in the Pictures
morning, looks
in the mirror, and says, "Boy, I sure
do look a lot like Megan Fox?" Who
went to a high school, like the one
in (insert every teen soap opera-
drama ever made here), where
even the nerds are attractive and
charismatic?
Even though they're on-screen
in fictional roles - and it's their job
to act like someone else - seldom
can a movie star be denoted "one
of us."
So when a film like "The Way
Way Back" comes along, featur-
ing a shy, skinny, pale pre-teen boy
named Duncan (Liam James, TV's
"Psych") who's forced to spend
the summer with his pushover
of a mother, Pam (Toni Collette,
"Hitchcock'), and her new asshole
of a boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell,
"The Incredible Burt Wonder-
stone") with his equally charm-
less brat of a daughter, Steph (Zoe
Levin, "Trust"), in tow - we smile
because that's familiar. We feel
you, Duncan.
Thankfully, Owen (Sam Rock-
well, "Seven Psychopaths"), the
goofball manager of a local water
park, takes Duncan under his
wing; he's like that fun and crazy
unclewhonevergrewupor"made
anything of himself" according
to the rest of the family when, in
actuality, they all secretly envy his
carefree spirit and zest for life.
In an equally hilarious, side-
splitting (yes, I said side-splitting)
performance, Allison Janney
("Touchy Feely") plays Betty, the
loquacious and lovable, booze-
happy next-door neighbor hanging
out of her crop top. She doubles as
the graciously aging, cool and hip
"Mom of the Year" to her son with
a wandering eye and her daughter,
Susanna (Annasophia Robb, "Soul

Surfer") who befriends Duncan.
Maya Rudolph ("Friends with
Kids") as Caitlin, a fellow employ-
ee at the water park slash Owen's
love interest, and Rob Corddry
("Pain and Gain") and Amanda
Peet ("Identity Thief") as Kip and
Trish, a couple of Trent's rowdy
pals, round out an incredible
ensemble cast.
But, despite the all-star lineup,
what sets this quirky indie dram-
edy apart from every other quirky
indie dramedy isn't really the
who, but rather what they do and
what escapes from their mouths -
sometimes narrowly, sometimes
blatantly.
Written and directed by Nat
Faxon and Jim Rash, who swept
the 2011 awards season with their
adapted screenplay for Alexander
Payne's "The Descendants," this
straightforward story relies on
authentic characters (Faxon and
Rash both make memorable cam-
eos themselves) who face everyday
scenarios and familiar challeng-
es garnished with imaginative
moments and accompanied by
downright outrageous dialogue.
It's no surprise that Duncan's
only mode of transportation would
be a pink and white bicycle with

CSG works

Proppe, Dishell
consider new
communications
director position
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student
Government has long been
struggling with their web and
social media presence - outlets
are often left without updates
and lack an audience.
But beyond including up-to-
date contact information for
staff and a list of CSG initiatives,
the site is inconsistent with the
CSG Constitution, as it doesn't
show the current budget or
reports from the University
Board of Regents meetings and
the University Council.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, CSG President, said
much of the problem stems from
an unclear understanding of who
is responsible for making sure
the necessary items go onto the
site. Dealing with the website is
one of his top priorities for the
late summer and fall.
"It's a little unprofessional
that the website isn't up-to-
date," Proppe said. "Also it's
important from a transparency
standpoint. Everything needs
to get placed on the website so
students and other University
community members can see it
and review it."
Engineering senior Kyle
Summers, CSG's webmaster, is
in charge of attending to the
website.
Summers said while he was
involved in CSG - he was

- he took the role of webmaster,
after re-doing the website.
He added features like
UPetition, a feature where
students can create a legitimate
student petition through the
website. However, last year,
Summers was not involved in
CSG as an elected member but
continued on as the webmaster.
Summers said the
responsibility then fell on the
elected officials to submit
documents to him to upload to
the site, and that his primary
role was not to attain current
documents himself.
Proppe said not having an
internal position with the clearly
defined role of keeping the
website current has hurt the site
in the past.
Proppe said his goal for
this year is to introduce a
Communications Director
position that would work to do
that. The position would cover
press releases, website updates
and Facebook and Twitter.
While the website may have
struggled in the past, CSG isn't
too far behind the rest of the Big
Ten's student governments. As of
July 21, seven of the 12 Big Ten
schools (not including University
of Maryland and Rutgers
University) had updated minutes
or agendas of their legislative
meetings and only five out of
the 12 had a current budget.
However, several schools who
didn't have the exact breakdown
of the finances did have a page

generally receive and procedures

UMHS to
collaborate with
area hospitals to
address health issues
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily News Editor
As one of the three major
hospitals in Washtenaw County,
the University Health System's
recently released community
health report could open the
door for a greater partnership
between the University Hospital
and county residents.
The Community Health
Needs Assessment is part of the
hospital's compliance with the
Affordable Care Act of 2010 -
President Barack Obama's health
care reform legislation - that
requires all tax-exempt hospitals
such as UMHS to conduct
reports on community health
status as well as implement
strategies to address discovered
issues. The report was drawn up
by a UMHS team who reviewed
data from a county-wide health
information survey.
Keven Mosley-Koehler,
coordinator of the Community
Benefit and Community Health
Needs Assessment, said the
report has proven beneficial to
the health needs of the area.
"Really I think that part of
the thrust of the Affordable
Care Act is really it's asking
the questions of health systems
saying 'how can we deploy the
economic power, the human
and intellectual resources of our
institution to build healthier and
more prosperous communities?'
" Mosley-Koehler said.
The 52-page report identified
the following community needs
as the targets of the hospital's
alum Sam Hamburger, Ross
senior Patricia Diaz and 1987 Ross
alum Brian Hermelin, who is an
active member of Opportunity
Detroit, a program spearheaded
by Quicken Loans Chairman and
Founder Dan Gilbert to draw

greatest attention, in order of
priority: access to care, mental
health, substance abuse, obesity,
pre-conceptual and perinatal
health, immunizations and child
abuse and neglect.
The data used in the CHNA
came from a survey in which
UMHS collaborated with the
Washtenaw County Public
Health Department, Saint
Joseph Mercy Hospital of Ann
Arbor and Chelsea Community
Hospital.
Due to the large sample
size, Mosley-Koehler said
the extensive survey enabled
UMHS to look not only at the
health needs within the county
as a whole, but also at trends
within different demographic
groups defined by factors
such as socioeconomic status,
race, region, education and
attainment of health insurance.
"As a whole, Washtenaw
County has comparable health
needs to other counties that have
comparable demographics," she
said. "But when you start to look
at the health within Washtenaw
County by these specific social
factors, that's when you start to
see really (great) differences ...
risk factors, health status, things
like that."
She said one of the most
dramatic factors for determining
health status is education level
of the population. For example,
25 percent of respondents from
the county as a whole reported
engaging in no physical activity
whereas the number was 65
percent when looking only at
respondents who had only a high
school education.
Mosley-Koehler said another
trend in the data was binge
drinking. However she said
unlike most other health
concerns, where the trends are
often determined by factors
attention to the positive aspects
of Detroit's renaissance.
Though Diaz grew up in the
Dominican Republic, she has
made a life in Michigan and said
she "hasn't been able" to leave.
"In Detroit I see people who

other than location, the Ann
Arbor area showed much higher
rates than other parts of the
county. She said this could be due
to the large student population
in the area.
Mosley-Koehler said one of
the most alarmingtrends that the
report touched on and marked
as a health priority was that of
child abuse and neglect, which is
increasing at a "staggering rate."
However, one of the reasons the
team chose to list child abuse
and neglect as a hospital priority
was in part their confidence in
their resources to target it.
"We believe that we have
the strength within our health
system in terms of our specially
trained providers and our child
protection team to work not only
within Washtenaw County but at
a state level to build everyone's
capacity to identify the signs of
child abuse and neglect and to
intervene early," she said.
In order to address the
county's health concerns
discovered in the data and
examined in the report, Mosley-
Koehler said the hospital system
will continue to prioritize
community . based efforts,
something she said the hospital
already shows strength in.
Mosley-Koehler said a major
part of "community benefit" -
something that the Affordable
Care Act requires tax-exempt
hospitals to provide - includes
subsidized and compensated
health care as well as community
improvement programs that
engage in education and
awareness.
She said the hospital's goals
are impossible without the
collaboration of other health
care partners within the area,
Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital
of Ann Arbor and Chelsea
Community Hospital.
are passionate and positive," she
said. "When I look around Detroit
I see (a place) for leadership to
leave a mark, to make a change,
because the energy is there
and people want to be a part of
Detroit's comeback."

"U" presidential search committee needs student members
Last Thursday the University Board of Regents announced the
members of the presidential search advisory committee - a body
responsible for choosing the next University president. However,
this committee currently contains no student members. This is a notable
and unwelcome change from the 2002 presidential search, where two
students were on the advisory committee. The University's president rep-
resents this campus - and one of the most important parts of this campus
is the student body. It's therefore imperative that they are properly rep-
resented in the search. The regents should appoint students to sit on the

Roads shut down in
annual celebration
of creativity
By ELLIOT ALPERN
ManagingEditor
There are four days in Ann
Arbor, four average July days
sweltering or storming with the
usual July weather, where the
cozy college town becomes ... well,
something else entirely. The signs
are there if you look hard enough
- the streets you walk every day
suddenly up and close; the pace of
foot traffic through the heart of
town transforms into a slog, the
sidewalks clogged thick with out-
of-towners. The residents who've
been here for past summers
know that something's coming,
something that will stop at noth-
ing to swallow the better part of
Ann Arbor for its four-day lifes-
pan. Those residents likely also
know that there are two choices:
stay home for a few days, or give
yourself up to the "original" Ann
Arbor Street Fair.
For what it's worth, the experi-
ence can be a blast; especially for
prospective artists or connois-

seurs alike. For local business-
es, the fair is an absolute boon,
packing the streets with throngs
of potential buyers despite the
insufferable heat this year that
topped off in the mid-90s. Even
for the casual observer, the expe-
rience of strolling down the cen-
ter line of State Street at noon on
a Saturday can be fun.
But it's undeniable, especially
for the multitudes who converge
on this college town from else-
where, that the Fair is something
to behold. On East University, a
small crowd gathered as silver-
smiths hammered out fresh wares
over a pit of glowing embers,
while others sifted through cus-
tom sets of silverware and jewel-
ry. Further up State, generations
of hippies trawled over a cabinet
of hand-blown glass pipes, oppo-
site clothes stands filled with
upper-class, older women.
As a student, attending the
Fair with any kind of hope for a
bounty of inexpensive treasures
is, if not impossible, at least far-
fetched. It's clear that the focus
here is, deservedly, the patrons
of art who have the cash to pump
into the local economy. Did you
enjoy that medium-sized oil
painting of intertwining trees?

That'll be $6,000 please, cash
or check. I think we have some
postcards on the other side that
are closer to your ... "style." It is
true that there are more man-
ageable prices if you look hard
enough, but going tent-to-tent for
something to hang on the wall is
a bit of a fantasy.
No, that's the draw for out-of-
towners with money to spend.
But that's not to say that the
Street Art Fair is worthless to
students - far from it. Where the
people flock to find art, students
should flock to find people, and
to experience what worthy art
is firsthand. It's otherwise rare
to find a family of sophisticated
aficionados rubbing elbows with
beatniks looking for some inspi-
ration, all in front of a metal
sculpture of a dog. That is to say,
next time, definitely come to the
Art Fair to peruse, to sample the
state of artistic expression in
Ann Arbor. But just don't bet on
finding that perfect landscape
to cover the dent in the wall.
Instead, after you've had your
fill, just relax and watch all of the
people who've travelled, not just
to enjoy the town you get to live
in, but to watch what makes that
town so special in the first place.

for diehard Ryan Gosling ("The
Place Beyond The Pines") or Refn
fans. It never reaches the soaring
heights achieved by Refosling's
previous venture "Drive," yet
comes alive in its attention to set-
ting.
That setting is the seedy Bang-
kok underworld housing Ameri-
can expatriate Julian Thompson
(Gosling), a man seeking revenge
for the brutal, bloody slaying
of his brother, who, in turn, got
killed by a man seeking revenge
for the brutal, bloody slaying of
his daughter. Revenge is like a
sadistic game of pinball in this
fucked up world, bouncing back
and forth, smacking and kill-
ing everything stupid enough to
get in the way of the next body-
count-high-score. That is, until
Chang steps in and puts a period
to all the tomfoolery. And despite
the fact that no trials or regula-
tions even pretend to exist, our
righteous antagonist distin-
guishes himself as the difference
between vengeance and justice,
the man who always has the last
word.
The movie itself is not so direct,
repeatedly skewered by extended
delays of dull, repetitive buildup
resulting in anticlimactic, often
disgustingly gory payoff, but
Refn's mastery of the visual and
visceral cannot be denied. The
shots look to have been plucked
from the walls of a Pulitzer prize-
winning photography exhibition,
boasting a certain indescribable
symmetry in every frame that
lets the pulsating, vibrant palette
engulf the action on-screen.
The end result is like watching
the background imbibe the fore-
ground. Whatever thin notion of
separation that otherwise might
have held our attention melts
away. It's woozy in the most beau-
tiful, mind-bending way perceiv-
able, and Refn is quick to mix us a
new drink every frame.
I'll let the hypnotic soundtrack
speak for itself. Yet, it's not
enough to save the film from
a tiresomely direct storyline

involving nothing more than an
easy, cut-and-dried, boring quest
for revenge. Revenge is meaning-
ful where there's some notion of
"hunter vs. the hunted" so that,
even at a marginal level, a game
of cat-and-mouse can develop,
letting our tensions rise and side
with a particular party.
"Drive" succeeded because it
played heavily on a forced trans-
formation of "the hunted" to
"the hunter," thereby setting up
its main stage thematic battle
between innocence and rage.
Here, it's like watching two con-
fused cats looking for each other.
Both want to set up the final con-
frontation but are too stupid to
figure out who they're supposed
to be fighting.
And never in my life have I
seen acting talent so completely
wasted. I mean, come the fuck
on Nicolas, you have goddamn
Ryan "Hey girl, my shirt fell off"
Gosling at your disposal, and you
give him a paltry fifteen lines at
best? Fifteen?!!?! What's worse
is he has no more than two-
count it, two - facial expressions
throughout the film: nonchalant
and sad. That's all. And let's not
forget that for a quarter of the
movie, his face is a pulpy, disfig-
ured mess. He doesn't smile once
- sigh.
Gosling's lackluster perfor-
mance is kind of (but not really)
offset by Kristen Scott Thomas's
(more reason for everyone to
see "I've Loved You So Long")
mind-boggling turn playing
what can only be described as
the "why did no one think of this
before" combination of "Real
Housewives of OC" cast member
meets mafia kingpin.
But alas, "Only God Forgives"
can never be forgiven for its ulti-
mate sin: It's neither thought-
provoking nor fun to watch.
It's a tired exercise in repeti-
tion, akin to the pinball known
as revenge in Bangkok. If only
Chang were there in the editing
room with his krabi to set things
straight.

Nice girls finish last

I see the blood on the leaves.
'God Forgives'
wastes stellar cast

' You have ice queen eyes. One
look and I swear you could kill a
man. You're no nice girl, you're
a maneater."
I raised an
irritated eyebrow
at my co-worker,
thinking 1) Can'tj
you see I'm busy?
and 2) What does
that even mean?
What the hell NATASHA
constitutes a nice ERTZBISCHOFF
girl and why would
I want to be one?
And seriously, a Hall & Oates reference
with that maneater bit? Way to date
yourself, you old geezer.
But isn't that life? As a woman,
you're either labeled a maneating bitch
for being assertive and confident or
you're a blase nice girl whom no one
respects. It's a no-win situation. So
what's a girl to do?
In this time of moral crisis, I turn
to the Betch Bible - authored by the
Betches, Jordana Abraham, Samantha
Fishbein and Aleen Kuperman, the
creators of the satirical website
Betches Love This. Principally, "the
nice girl plays by the rules without
ever questioningthem. She's dull, lacks
depth, lets people walk all over her, yet
bringsnothingtothetable."Ihaveshoes
that are more shiny and interesting
than a nice girl. The Betches give me
three caveats for avoiding turning into
this one-dimensional pushover - don't
be easy, poor or ugly. My translation
- accomplish your career aspirations,
take pride in your image and don't let
men use you. Being a nice girl isn't
going to get you any closer to these
goals. In fact, nice girls perpetuate the
stereotype that "women are inferior,
that we're not smart or funny and we
should stay in the kitchen." Essentially
nice girls are the Sandra Dees of the
world, and who wants to be a goody
two shoes who doesn't drink, swear,
rat her hair or go to bed 'til she's legally
wed? I thought so.
Sandy's sheepish attitude about
boys - which is as retro as the '50s - is
disintegrating in modern culture. The
New York Times published an article
entitled, "Sex on Campus: She Can
Play That Game, Too," about the fall
of the nice girl lifestyle and the rise of
women in hook-up culture in tandem
with their academic aspirations.
The article features University of
Pennsylvania women who bravely say
what many of us are thinking - if men
can hook up and avoid burdensome
commitment, all while getting ahead,
why can't we? We really can play that
game, too. Even sweet Sandra Dee
realized that by the end of Grease,

using her new leather outfit and slick
attitude to put Danny Zuko in his
place. In fact, one anonymous woman
at UPenn refused to apologize for her
healthy sexual appetite and habits
because nobody will remember that
about her. More importantly, they'll
remember her transcript and her
accomplishments on campus. She's
kick-ass and definitely not a nice girl.
There's nothing wrong with that
- she's an admirable, modern-day
feminist pioneer.
Should we all turn
over a new leaf and
become nice girls?
Take a second and think - as a
woman - about whom you admire. I
admire Beyonee. At her concert this
past weekend, she emerged in a burst
of gold confetti, wind in her glorious
hair, wearing a bejeweled leotard. She
sung of girls running the world, the
epitome of women empowerment.
Why do I have such a girl crush
on Queen Bey? She's anything but a
nice girl - unlike Taylor Swift, who
sings about how countless guys have
dumped her or used her as a doormat
(take a hint, he's just not that into you).
Beyoned is a charismatic dominatrix
who sings fierce lyrics about boys
being far from irreplaceable, not
little ol' country ditties begging
some dude to realize that you belong
with meeeee. She's an icon, inspiring
women to never take shit from guys,
to be proud of your sexuality and to
never stop working hard until you've
made it to the top. You think Beyonce
would be where she is today if she
sang "Kumbaya" and wore a knee
length skirt? Psh, TSwift you can keep
your sneakers and your spot on the
bleachers, and I'll put on my high heels
and step into the spotlight.
Although the anti-nice girl
campaign is catching on, it does have
its critics. So, should we all turn over
a new leaf and become - dare I say it
- nice girls?
Nah. After all, nice girls finish last.
So the next time someone accuses
you of being confident, direct, having
too high of standards or a cruder
synonym, smile and say thank you.
Tell them maneaters are here to stay,
so watch out boys, we'll chew you up.

enced. These advancements
are radically reshaping our
social organization, keeping us
constantly interconnected and
informed. Furthermore, even
those marginally interested in
current political happenings
know that not only is polariza-
tion rampant, it's at its highest
levels ever.
Ultimately, it's our intercon-
nectivity that's driving this
polarization. Our lives are con-
stantly subjected to the influ-
ence of others, and tremendous
pressure exists to align along
prepackaged, Saran-wrapped
political ideologies that elimi-
nate our capacity for informed,
objective discourse.
If the politicians, news out-
lets, talking heads, pundits
and crab people alike are to be
believed, we can only be two
things: conservative or liberal.
In fact, you are neither.
You're a pure Michigander,
a Suburbanite and a City Kid. A
student, a fratstar, a hipster and
a Wolverine. You wipe sitting
down and standing, you put
your left foot in - and above all,
you just want to be accepted.
Like it or not, we're obsessed.

with our status and statuses. A
Facebook friend count may no
longer matter, but even if we say
otherwise we damn well expect
numerous birthday comments
from people we haven't talked
to in years. An un-liked status
is a blemish, and even those
who denounce social media still
do so in an effort to categorize
themselves as that guy.
It's only human to want to
feel connected and a part of
something, but it's clear that
our hyper-connectivity has
taken this to extreme levels. As
a result, we've become infatu-
ated with labels and definitions,
and in doing so have convinced
ourselves that there are only
two ways to view any event.
But you're the conglomera-
tion of a series of vastly differ-
ent experiences and thoughts
uniquely your own, and you're
not easily quantifiable.
It's a polarized world out
there, and we must remain
vigilant in separating the ide-
ologies from the facts, reality
from sensationalism and take
each issue on an individual
basis. To identify with the
label of conservative or liberal
limits the intellectual develop-
ment of yourself and - akin
to the many so-called experts
cryingMillennial - allows you
to hide behind trite and coun-
terproductive talking points.
I fail to see why just because
you prefer conservative
monetary policy you must
also oppose increased gun
legislation and human-induced
climate change. Likewise,
where's the connection
between redistributive
wealth practices, marijuana
legalization and pro-choice
policies towards abortion?
These issues are simply
not related. Some aren't even
inherently political. Yet, it has
become increasingly convenient
for politicians and media outlets
to convince you they are. Their
jobs are significantly easier
when the world exists on a
binary scale, where there's no
middle ground, no truth beyond
theirs or fallacies beyond that of
their opponents.
Just as we subscribe to our
favorite Instagram and Twit-
ter accounts, so too have we
made politics a form of enter-
, tainment. We tune into what

we want and drop the rest out.
In doing so, we've forgone any
hypothesis, drawing similari-
ties between events that are
nonexistent and reinforcing
media outlets that proudly tout
their biases, creating an atmo-
sphere of us against them.
This past Saturday was the
one year anniversary of the
Aurora, Colorado shooting.
Unfortunately, there probably
will be another, similar case to
that of State of Florida v. George
Zimmerman. The "nuclear
option" showdown was only an
appetizer for this fall's budget
shouting contest. I remember
each side's viewpoint on all
these events, but I never remem-
ber talking about them. There is
no analysis - only the pursuit
of ammunition to use against
the oppositions. Proactive con-
versation is either nonexistent
or comprised of predetermined
ideological fodder.
You're
not easily
quantifiable.
Our interconnectivity has
the potential to engage our
generation in unprecedented
ways, enabling social discourse
that truly represents view-
points from all spectra. We're
an incredibly creative genera-
tion - already leveraging our
abilities for civic betterment in
ways past generations couldn't
even dream of.
But process drives
outcome, and we must resist
those who would hijack
our interconnectivity to
exploit our intense desire for
acceptance, to ignore those
whose job it is to sell finalized
and uncompromisingopinions.
We're Millenials - we lack
hubris and like tacos, alcohol
and casual hookups. We escape
definition - we're neither blue
nor red and we have the capac-
ity and means to rise above
the polarization. We just need
to start using our tools on our
own terms.

Winding Refn
follows 'Drive' with
gory, repetitious film
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
A krabi sword whistles though
the air, its path washed in red-
dish neon glare as it makes the
slow, weighted journey to a man's
outstretched arm. Nicolas Wind-

ing Refn ("Drive") forces us to
watch, but as the crescendoing
beat tightens to a standstill, we
pull away. The blood spurts, the
screams come, yet we're looking
elsewhere. We're looking into the
face of Lieutenant Chang (Vitha-
ya Pansringarm, "The Hangover
Part II"). We're looking into the
face of God.
Chang is a personification of
pure justice, uninhibited by the
overhanging limitations of law
and order. As an agent of death

answering only to his own tem-
pered code of ethics, he becomes
the natural source of conflict in a
film totally defined by its savage,
Polanski-esque treatment of set-
ting.
Chang also becomes one of the
few redeeming features of "Only
God Forgives." Pause. Before
jumping to any early conclusions,
it's worth noting that though
lukewarm, this is not a terrible
movie, completely worth the tick-
et price and 90-minute run-time

Beyond the official site, Proppe
said he has generally been pleased
with CSG's social networking
presence, which included
maintaining an updated Twitter
account over the summer.
Proppe said he also hopes to
start a series of blogs that would
be updated weekly by the CSG
executives to allow students a
better look into the organization.
"A lot of people don't know
what are the day-to-day
operations of central student
government," Proppe said. "'Why
is this position a 40 hour-a-week
position?' Not a lot of people
really know that."
Proppe has compiled a list
of the issues with the CSG site
that he hopes to get fixed and is
in communication with Public
Policy junior Bobby Dishell, CSG
Vice President, to begin work on
the site.

CHAPTER 9
From Page 1
Currently - according to the
release - Detroit is facing $18
billion in debt. A report from
Orr in June, the Proposal for
Creditors, illustrated Detroit's
dwindling economic status over
the past few decades, showing
that between 2000 and 2012
Detroit's population decreased by
26 percent with unemployment
increasing by 12 percent within
that time.
Both Snyder's press release and
the report stated that the hope
was to incentivize investment
and growth for the city down the
line. Orr's plan would spend $1.25
billion over the next 10 years to
revamp and restructure the city's
main services, police, fire, trash
and street lamps.
Wednesday, one day before
bankruptcy was filed, the General
Retirement System of the City of
Detroit and the Police and Fire
Retirement System of the City of
Detroit filed a lawsuit with the
Ingham County Circuit Court in
Lansing against Snyder and Orr.
The plaintiffs claim that filing
bankruptcy and disrupting the
LANGUAGE
From Page 2
In order to determine that
Warlpiri Rampaku is distinct from
its parent languages, O'Shannessy
had speakers tell a story from a
picture book, or had two people
simply talk to each other while
she recorded the conversation.
She found unique grammatical
patterns forming, which is one
of the factors that makes Light
Warlpiri a language of its own.
The pattern for Light Warlpiri
involves the use of a mostly
Warlpiri sentence with an English
or Kriol verb. For example, to
ask someone "Where did you
go?" in Warlpiri, one would say
"Nyarrpara-kurra-npa yanu?" But
in Light Warlpiri, one would say
"Nyarrpara-kurra yu-m go?"
Here, the Light Warlpiri version
uses the English word for "go",
and "yu-m" translates to the non-
future version of "you". But in
the Warlpiri version of the same
sentence, "yanu" is used for the
past tense of "go" and the "you" is
expressed as "-npa".
Both the lack of a dictionary and

city employees' pension funds
would violate Article XI, Section
24 of the Michigan Constitution.
The article states that pension
funds "shall be a contractual
obligation thereof which shall
not be diminished or impaired
thereby."
A press release from the Detroit
Police and Fire Department
Retirement System stated that it
was willing to cooperate with Orr
but was also legally required to
protect pension funds. It asked
the court to prevent "taking any
action which would contravene
the protections of Article IX,
Section 24."
Orr's order reads that any
element that is deemed illegal or
unenforceable can be "severable"
without completely removing the
order.
The case was heard by
Judge Steven Rhodes in the
U.S. Bankruptcy court for the
Eastern District of Michigan.
The Detroit News reported that
Rhodes froze the lawsuits against
the city but did not rule yet on
whether Detroit is eligible for
Chapter 9 and did not rule on the
constitutional legality of Snyder
filing the city for bankruptcy.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor), who has spoken out
writing system - speakers write
in traditional Warlpiri instead
- point to the newness of the
language.
Determining the difference
between a language and a dialect
is often difficult, but O'Shannessy
said it often has to do with political
and social criteria. However, she
added that if two systems are not
mutually intelligible, they aren't
considered the same language.
O'Shannessy said a person
who spoke Warlpiri but not
Aboriginal English or Australian
English, wouldn't understand
Light Warlpiri. However, all
Warlpiri speakers in Lajamanu do
actually understand Light Warlpiri
because they are all multilingual.
Light Warlpiri is not mutually
intelligible with Aboriginal
English or Australian English,
so it's not considered simply a
different dialect.
Linguistics Prof. Sarah
Thomason said O'Shannessy's
discovery and ability to study a
language from its beginning is
particularly remarkable.
"It's so rare to find something
this unusual when you can actually
study (its development) in real
time," she said. "There aren't that

against the minimal requirements
needed to implement the
Emergency Manager position,
said he was frustrated with the
way Detroit's finances have been
handled in the past. He said other
communities around the state
have received funding while the
government seems less inclined
to bail out Detroit.
However, Irwin said the
magnitude of the city's financial
woes is likely too great for an easy
fix. City management has far less
to blame for the deficit than does
the city's diminished population.
"They're trying to pay for
the pension obligations of the
policemen and the firemen that
patrolled that city when they
had two million people in it," he
said. "Imagine if the population
of the United States shrunk from
330 million to 110 million; do you
think we'd be able to make Social
Security payments? Probably
not."
With the bankruptcy only
recently filed, it may be too early
to determine the full impact on
both Detroit and the University's
involvement within the city.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said at an event
in Detroit on Tuesday that she
was not concerned Detroit's
many well understood mixed
languages."
Thomason compared Light
Warlpiri to Michif, a language
spoken in Canada that combines
French and Cree and is often
characterized by Cree verbs
incorporated into French phrases.
"The people who created these
things had to know both Cree and
French to do it, but if you know
French, you wouldn't understand
Michif because you wouldn't know
the verbs," she said.
Similarly, Thomason said, "You
can't just wing Light Warlpiri,"
even if you know the languages it's
derived from, because there are
structures that don't occur in those
languages.
"It's very unusual to have the
opportunity to see a language
develop like this, but there are still
many questions as to how it will
develop," O'Shannessy said.
Given the permission of the
Lajamanucommunity,O'Shannessy
plans to continue her research
indefinitely. With time she said she
hopes to analyze how grammatical
structures change, if and how new
words are developed and whether
Light Warlpiri's speakers continue
to use the language.

bankruptcy would have any
impact on the University.
"I am really not," she said.
"I have tremendous confidence
in Kevin Orr ... it is going to be
painful to get back, I understand
it. But if it gives the city a chance
to start over, then we all just have
got to make that happen."
Craig Regester, associate
director of the Semester in
Detroit program, said he doubts
the economic problems will
deter students from becoming or
remaining involved in Detroit.
Regester said University
students would continue to have
a role in influencing the city
but that he and the students
take a "humble approach" to
their contribution, crediting the
Detroit residents for maintaining
the city through years of
hardship.
"Yeah, they (the students)
have something to contribute,

absolutely, but they also probably
have as much, if not more, to
learn and to understand about the
world through beingaand working..-
(in Detroit) along with so many
people who have been doing this
for decades in the city," he said.
Regester said he also felt
that many people don't have a
full understanding of the city's
strengths and weaknesses, which"
contributes to the problem.
"Even with the official
declaration of bankruptcy, and
this is no small financial shift,
the various organizations that
have emerged all throughout
the city could almost be seen
as an unofficial, second quasi-
government that will keep on
functioning, as it has for so long
now, independently of the city."
