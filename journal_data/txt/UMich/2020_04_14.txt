Washtenaw County has more than 

700 cases of COVID-19 as of this 

week. While residents who identify as 

African American or Black make up 

12.4 percent of the county population, 

48 percent of hospitalized cases are 

residents who identify as African 

American or Black.

This 
pattern 
is 
consistent 
in 

coronavirus cases across that state 

and the nation. Detroit has almost 

7,000 cases of COVID-19 and close to 

400 deaths. Of those same cases, 57.7 

percent are African American Detroit 

residents and 75.7 percent of COVID-19 

deaths are African Americans.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has taken 

measures to address the increasing 

number of cases among African 

Americans in Michigan, including 

creating a minority taskforce to advise 

her on issues concerning the Black 

community led by Lt. Gov. Garlin 

Gilchrist. She has declared a state of 

disaster and is working with the federal 

government to get more ventilators and 

personal protective equipment. 

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

communications and health promotion 

administrator, sent out an email 

to 
Washtenaw 
County 
residents 

highlighting data about race and 

zip codes. This email explained the 

disparities 
between 
the 
African 

American 
COVID-19 
cases 
from 

Washtenaw County and the total 

population 
of 
African 
American 

residents from Washtenaw County.

Proposed changes to tenure bylaws include refusal 
of severance pay in cases of alleged misconduct

Recommendations from working group alter Regents’ Bylaws 5.09, 5.10, streamlining process of reviewing cases

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

announced recommended changes to 

policies for handling the dismissal of 

tenured faculty members on Monday, 

more than six months after a tenure 

bylaw working group comprised of 

nine faculty members was formed to 

discuss these recommendations. These 

changes impact Regents’ Bylaws 5.09 

and 5.10, which deal with procedures 

for dismissing tenured faculty accused 

of crimes or misconduct, in addition to 

severance pay policies.

Changes to the bylaws include 

creating one streamlined process for 

cases referred to the Senate Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs, 

forming a new SACUA Standing 

Judicial Committee and Hearing 

Committee of tenured faculty and 

implementing a policy that suspends 

a faculty member’s pay during the 

investigation if they were accused of a 

felony involving violence, among other 

revisions. 

The group also recommended the 

University not provide severance pay 

to tenured faculty members accused of 

“moral turpitude” or misconduct.

In a statement, Susan Collins, 

interim provost and executive vice 

president 
for 
academic 
affairs, 

reiterated the University’s commitment 

to protecting the institution of tenure 

and mentioned the need to account for 

unusual circumstances requiring the 

dismissal of tenured faculty.

“The academic freedom granted 

by tenure is at the core of everything 

we do at the University of Michigan,” 

Collins told The University Record. 

“However, there are some situations, 

though rare, that rightfully fall outside 

of tenure’s protections.”

The Board of Regents is scheduled 

to discuss and vote on these revisions 

at their upcoming meeting on May 21.

In an email to The Daily, University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald said the 

changes are a result of work done by 

the faculty working group. 

“This recommendation is largely the 

work of a group of faculty members, 

appointed by the provosts on all three 

campuses,” Fitzgerald said.

Washtenaw County residents discuss barriers in preventing virus

Meet the essential 
University workers

The University of Michigan feels 

like a ghost town.

In any normal year, April might 

be one of the most active months 

on campus. As the weather warms 

up, students cautiously come out of 

hibernation. The Diag comes alive 

with picnickers and hammockers, 

resembling stock photos of an 

idyllic college campus. This is 

when freshmen venture down to 

Blank Slate to get their first ice 

cream scoops of the calendar year 

and when seniors frolic in caps 

and gowns, showing their families 

around a campus they have called 

home for four years. 

Instead, campus is almost entirely 

empty, which Music, Theatre & 

Dance and LSA sophomore Michael 

Hu, a student transit coach operator, 

said feels both terrifying and surreal.

“Seeing the places that you’re so 

used to being filled with people, 

some of these areas you just never 

have seen without people,” Hu said. 

“And it’s definitely a crazy sight 

to see — the places are completely 

empty.”

Since classes shifted online in 

mid-March due to the coronavirus 

outbreak, students were urged to 

go home unless they “truly have no 

other alternatives.” Most students 

have left campus, leaving closed 

libraries 
and 
other 
University 

buildings behind. Following Gov. 

Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 
stay-at-

home executive orders, almost all 

University faculty and staff have 

been told to work from home as well. 

In 
response 
to 
uncertainties 

resulting from the pandemic, the 

University created an 80-hour “U-M 

COVID-19 Paid Time Off” bank on 

March 13 for all full-time employees 

for any COVID-19 related scenario. 

Starting 
April 
1, 
the 
Federal 

Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act 

provides employees an additional 

80 hours of PTO on top of the U-M 

COVID-19 bank. Michigan Medicine 

employees who need to self-isolate 

after contracting the virus are also 

eligible for a 120-hour time off work 

bank in addition to the other two 

banks.

However, 
“certain 
employees 

designated 
as 
critical 
to 

infrastructure or public health and 

safety” continue to report in-person 

to work. Some are our custodians, 

the individuals who do the work 

behind reassurances from numerous 

University-affiliated 
offices 
that 

cleaning protocols have increased.

The University announces proposed tenure changes that could refuse severance pay in cases of misconduct.

News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The Senate Advisory Committee on 

University Affairs met Monday afternoon 

via BlueJeans to discuss a meeting 

SACUA had with University of Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel earlier that 

morning. Members also heard statements 

from SACUA members running for chair 

and vice chair.

During the meeting with Schlissel, 

SACUA members said they asked the 

president about virtual commencement, 

as well as financial effects from COVID-

19. 

SACUA Chair Joy Beatty said the 

administration is working on finalizing 

various 
pre-recorded 
videos 
from 

commencement speakers, such as Al Gore 

and others, as discussed in the earlier 

meeting. According to Beatty, there will 

also be videos from the School of Music, 

Theater & Dance performing “Hail to the 

Victors” and other “nostalgic type things 

to make people feel Michigan pride.” 

She mentioned there are talks still 

under development about a formal 

ceremony next year with the 2021 

graduates.

“(The) 
intent 
is 
to 
celebrate 

commencement but not be a replacement 

for commencement,” Beatty said. “They 

are actually thinking about offering some 

type of more formal commencement 

ceremony next year.” 

Beatty said SACUA members also 

asked Schlissel about the University’s 

financial situation with COVID-19. The 

University refunded $1,200 to students 

who moved out of residence halls by 

March 25 and has faced other unexpected 

financial outflows.

“Money is down,” Beatty said. “This 

is going to be a problem. They’re worried 

about it. They’ve been thinking about 

state appropriations. They don’t think 

that money will be taken from us this year 

because it’s so late in the budget cycle but 

likely there could be some effect next year 

when the budgets get rolled out.”

Beatty also mentioned the financial 

aid office will have to come up with 

“creative ways” to support students given 

that aid is usually allotted based on tax 

documents. However, strains on families 

due to loss of income or other hardships 

related to COVID-19 will not be reflected 

in last year’s documents.

Last Friday, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 

D-Mich. 
announced 
colleges 
and 

universities in Michigan’s 12th district 

will receive more than $66 million 

in emergency grants to make up for 

financial losses due to the COVID-19 

outbreak. The University will receive 

$25,244,052 total.

The University announced earlier this 

month that employees of the University 

who require absence from work for 

COVID-19-related reasons are eligible for 

a paid time off supplement through April 

30. Beatty said Schlissel is working on a 

plan starting May 1. 

In Schlissel’s meeting with SACUA, 

Beatty said he emphasized the University, 

in taking steps to adjust the budget, will 

prioritize employment relations with 

faculty and staff.

“They want to avoid breaking the 

moral 
contract 
with 
employees,” 

Beatty said. “The last step, according to 

(Schlissel), would be reductions in force 

and layoffs… They are unlikely to be able 

to continue after May 1 at 100 percent. 

(Schlissel said he is) confident (they) will 

make it through and aim to be equitable 

in how those cuts need to be made.”

Beatty also said the administration 

is dedicated to restart research soon 

but will proceed carefully and adhere 

strictly 
to 
public 
health 
officials’ 

recommendations. According to Beatty, 

these recommendations will also be 

the guideline for making decisions on 

students returning to campus.

SACUA Vice Chair Colleen Conway 

was also in the meeting with Schlissel. She 

clarified a previous announcement about 

a digital diploma, explaining graduates 

will receive both a printed diploma in the 

mail as well as an additional, free digital 

version of their diploma.

Lastly, Beatty said Schlissel reassured 

SACUA that Michigan Medicine has 

enough personal protective equipment 

to handle the COVID-19 crisis. According 

to Beatty, each worker is matched to their 

needed level of protective equipment 

based on their proximity to COVID-19 

patients, as the hospital does not have 

enough resources to give every worker 

the maximum protective gear. 

Some workers at Michigan Medicine 

have raised concerns about wanting the 

maximum protective gear to ensure their 

safety at work. Schlissel said Michigan 

Medicine thus far discourages workers 

from bringing their own equipment 

from home, which leads to uncertainty 

in verifying that the gear is adequate 

and correct. He said a clearer policy 

on personal protective equipment at 

Michigan Medicine is underway. 

The meeting turned to discussions on 

SACUA elections for the position of chair 

and vice chair, which go live at 5 p.m. 

Monday through an electronic voting 

website. The results will be processed 

tomorrow. 

Music, Theatre & Dance Professor 

Conway is running uncontested for 

SACUA chair. SACUA members Annalisa 

Manera, Engineering professor, and 

Deirdre Spencer, librarian, are running 

for the seat of vice chair.

In her statement to the SACUA body, 

Conway spoke of how much she’s enjoyed 

being a part of SACUA thus far. She said 

she hopes to continue Beatty’s work 

as chair and enhance communication 

between the Senate Assembly and its 

committees.

“When I ran for SACUA two years ago, 

I don’t think I would’ve ever predicted 

that two years later I would be saying 

‘I think I would like to be chair of this 

organization,’” Conway said. “Especially 

over the past year, I’ve really enjoyed 

watching Joy and getting to see how we 

balance this funkiness being (a liaison) 

with administrators and having an 

opportunity to be their ear and be helpful 

to them at the same time as supporting 

faculty. Sometimes those things are 

difficult. It’s been fun to watch (Beatty) 

and get a sense of that.”

Spencer emphasized her experience 

as a librarian, which she said involves 

working with different entities and 

trying to build consensus between two 

sometimes opposing bodies.

COVID-19
From Page 1

Some are our dining hall staff, making sure 

students who remain in the residence halls 

can still depend on takeout meals. And some 

are our bus drivers, ensuring no matter how 

disorienting the world may get, you can still 

miss the bus to North Campus. 

Here are some of the many University 

essential employees, as they share how COVID-

19 has affected their lives, and what they want 

University students to know. 

Custodial Services

According to an email to The Daily from 

Lukeland Gentles, custodial and grounds 

services director, the department is currently 

operating at approximately 30 percent capacity. 

Gentles wrote that staff have upped cleaning 

and disinfection of high-touch services, such as 

doorknobs and handles, light switches, elevator 

buttons, handrails and drinking fountains.

When a positive case is reported on campus, 

Gentles wrote the team works with the 

Environment, Health and Safety Department 

to provide quick-response cleaning. Though 

the team regularly checks the majority of 

campus buildings, which Gentles wrote still 

have some level of activity, the team prioritizes 

areas critical to the University’s mission such as 

those which support essential research, animal 

care and remote learning.

To protect custodians on the job, Gentles 

wrote the department provides personal 

protective equipment such as masks and 

gloves as well as training on how to use this 

equipment. According to Gentles, anyone who 

is sick is encouraged to stay home.

“Our custodians play an essential role in 

slowing the spread of COVID-19 on campus,” 

Gentles wrote. “They are motivated about 

supporting the university. There is some 

anxiety, and like all of us, they worry about 

contracting the virus. We do as much as we 

can to mitigate the risk. We really appreciate 

their dedication to keeping this university 

operational.”

Contrell Cooper, University custodian

As of April 1, Contrell Cooper has been 

working at the University for exactly 20 years. 

He spent his first 17 years at the Michigan 

Union and when it closed for renovations, his 

move to East Quad was supposed to only be 

temporary. But Cooper decided to stay.

“And what motivated me to stay where I’m 

at and why I like it so much, my birthday had 

came up,” Cooper said. “It was December 12. 

So, you know, I get to work and whatnot. And 

I see this birthday card on my custodial door… 

And all my students, they gave me some lovely 

birthday cards, cards that they made and stuff 

like that. It really, really made me feel good.”

Starting March 20, Cooper decided to take 

two weeks off from the 80-hours paid time 

bank. When asked if he ever felt nervous going 

to work in light of the pandemic, Cooper said he 

both was and wasn’t. 

“I will say this, in a way I was, but in a way 

I wasn’t,” Cooper said. “And the reason why 

I said in a way I was because I just wanted to 

make sure that students knew exactly what was 

going on. And the other part of that question, 

we were pretty prepared for everything that 

was coming our way.”

Cooper said he feels protected while working, 

as he never takes off his gloves. When asked if 

he has felt there’s been more work required of 

him and other custodial staff now that keeping 

the campus clean is a health priority, Cooper 

said he thinks additional work is necessary.

“I think it’s good that we have to put in extra 

work because we try to keep everybody safe,” 

Cooper said. “And I thought it was a good idea 

for them to tell us to basically step our game 

up.”

During the school year, Cooper said he 

bonded with all the students who lived on the 

floor he was responsible for.

“I’m so used to everybody, every time I 

came to work, somebody said ‘How you doing 

Cooper?’” Cooper said. “I call everybody on my 

floor my little brothers and my little sisters.”

When students began to move out of the 

residence halls, Cooper said it upset him to see 

his students leave, even though he knew it was 

for the best. However, he said he hopes to see 

students moving in once again in the fall.

“I wish I could have videotaped, I mean, 

people was crying, giving me hugs, like they 

didn’t want to leave,” Cooper said. “And I 

didn’t want to see them leave… And I know I’m 

jumping the gun when I say this, but I can’t 

wait until everybody get back… That’s my hope, 

that we could start on time and have everybody 

moved back and new students moving in. 

Because like I said, we can overcome this. We 

just got to stick together and just deal with 

what’s coming in.”

Ann Washington, Student Publications 

Building custodian 

Production of The Daily, like most everything 

in the University, has moved entirely online. 

Once filled five days a week with dozens of 

staffers until late into the night, the newsroom 

is now empty and inaccessible to most of 

the staff. Other publications in the Student 

Publications 
Building 
— 
Michiganensian 

Yearbook, SHEI Magazine and Gargoyle — 

have vacated it temporarily as well. 

Yet, twice a week, Ann Washington, a 

custodian with A&G Cleaning and Janitorial 

Services, still comes to clean the building. She 

comes to take out the trash, sweep down the 

steps, vacuum and mop the floors. 

When asked if she thinks the building 

should be kept open, Washington said she will 

continue to come to work until her manager 

tells her to stop.

“It wasn’t a whole lot of work,” Washington 

said. “It’ll really be up to them. If they feel like 

it should be closed, then they can close it. But 

with me, I don’t have no say. So how long it can 

stay open or anything like that, I just know as 

long as it’s running, I have to go to work. I know 

that, that’s all I know.”

However, Washington said she isn’t afraid of 

contracting COVID-19 by cleaning the Student 

Publications Building because she knows not 

many people frequent the building anymore. To 

protect herself, she sprays Lysol as she enters 

the building and wears gloves and a mask. 

If she were to have to clean a building 

frequented by a lot of people, Washington 

said she would not go to work. Until then, 

Washington said she wants students who 

usually use the Student Publications Building 

to know she is ensuring the building is safe and 

healthy for students when they return. 

“I’m going to make sure that when you 

guys do come back in that building, I’ve 

been disinfecting that building real good,” 

Washington said. “I’ve been disinfecting 

everything in there for just in case. I’m trying to 

keep everything safe and healthy for all of us… I 

have to look out for you guys, I have to look out 

for me, I have to look out for everybody in that 

building, and I don’t mind.”

Transit Services

Lisa Solomon, communications manager for 

Logistics, Transportation & Parking, said, in an 

email to The Dail, that about one-third of the 

department’s staff are still reporting to work on 

campus. 

“Like other units within Facilities & 

Operations, 
Logistics, 
Transportation 
& 

Parking continues to perform critical and 

essential university functions and in support 

of operations at Michigan Medicine during the 

COVID-19 pandemic,” Solomon wrote.

Solomon wrote essential services provided 

by transit employees include transporting 

front-line employees such as those at 

Michigan 
Medicine, 
moving 
materials 

and 
equipment 
to 
Michigan 
Medicine 

and providing waste management for the 

campus.

Also stated in the email were factors that could 

have contributed to the disparities in data, such 

as structural and environmental racism, access 

to health care and societal and economic factors. 

The county also shared that the COVID-19 cases 

are concentrated in Ypsilanti and Ypsilanti 

Township. 

Ringler-Cerniglia told The Daily that the 

Washtenaw County Health Department has 

been working on eliminating these disparities 

before COVID-19 occurred and is continuing to 

listen to the concerns of affected communities 

throughout the pandemic. 

“This isn’t something that we see only with 

Coronavirus. So it’s part of what we, as a public 

health department, are striving to do and 

improve all the time,” Ringler-Cerniglia said. 

“We have long standing efforts to work with 

community members and with organizations 

to identify where we see these types of impacts 

and work to approve that to improve them.” 

African Americans are more at risk to die 

from COVID-19 due to underlying health 

conditions that stem from systematic racism. 

Conditions such as diabetes, asthma and high 

blood pressure are more prevalent among 

African Americans, making them more likely to 

die from the virus. 

One initiative Washtenaw County has put 

together is a Community Voices for Health 

Equity Team. Alex Thomas lives in Ypsilanti 

Township and is a member of this team as 

a representative for West Willow. He has 

been working as a community advocate since 

2016 and has worked with the University of 

Michigan to address the needs of the West 

Willow neighborhood.

Thomas told The Daily that many factors 

impact the social determinants of health 

that make the African American population 

in Ypsilanti more vulnerable to COVID-19. 

Conditions such as poverty contribute to 

childhood trauma and housing stability as 

prevalent conditions in Washtenaw County. 

“Housing instability. If you don’t have a 

place to live, you’re kind of going to be more 

susceptible,” Thomas said. “And so we have a 

huge houseless population on the streets or … 

instability, that causes a lot of stress. And that’s 

an immunosuppressant that compromises the 

immune system stress and anxiety. And it’s very 

stressful anxiety if you don’t have a place to live… 

But if you spend 50 percent of your income on 

housing, you’re not going to have discretionary 

income and these needs are going to be unmet. 

And you’re going to have those impacts of stress 

and anxiety.”

A K-12 teacher in Washtenaw County spoke 

to The Daily about her students. Due to fear 

of retaliation at her place of work, she will be 

referred to as Jane for the rest of the article. Jane 

is a teacher in Washtenaw County and notes 

that many of her students are essential workers 

in grocery stores. Many essential workers have 

been diagnosed with COVID-19, which makes 

them susceptible to fatal causes. She said she 

sees how COVID-19 is impacting students in her 

community through circumstances that harm 

their safety at home.

“A lot of our students experience an 

overwhelming amount of trauma just within 

high school. Even going out for essential items, 

I see a lot of my students just outside,” Jane said. 

“I have to remember to not be the person to be 

like, ‘hey you need to go home’ because they 

are dealing with so much. So I think trauma at 

home makes them vulnerable. I definitely think 

a lot of them have asthma, and that makes them 

vulnerable. And I think there’s been a lot of the 

essential workforce in the community and their 

parents makes them vulnerable to it.”

Yodit Mesfin Johnson, president and CEO 

of Nonprofit Enterprises at Work, told The 

Daily about the income disparity in Washtenaw 

County and how the division of wealth in 

Washtenaw has contributed to underlying 

factors that make communities vulnerable to 

COVID-19.

“Washtenaw County is the third wealthiest 

county in the state of Michigan, yet 40 percent 

of the people who live in this community live 

at what we call ALICE levels, Asset limited 

income constrained,” Johnson said. “So these 

are people who are living check to check or 

in poverty. Forty percent of our communities 

are living at or below poverty. And of that 40 

percent, 60 percent of those people are African 

American and reside on the east side of the 

county in Ypsilanti, Willow Run, and Ypsi City. 

I think that’s also important because this is a 

story of ‘A Tale of Two Cities.’ People perceive 

us as this progressive liberal, wealthy bedroom 

community of Detroit, but we have people 

literally barely making ends meet in the third 

wealthiest county.” 

Alfred Young Jr., professor of sociology at the 

University, conducts research on low-income, 

urban-based African Americans. Young told 

The Daily many African Americans are not able 

to stay inside as they must continue working in 

order to survive this crisis. 

 “Many African Americans, particularly of 

low-income circumstances, do not have the 

luxury of thinking about staying at home as 

the best means of surviving the crisis,” Young 

said. “They have little to no financial reserve. 

Therefore, as much as many Americans think 

that staying home ensures survival, struggling 

African Americans, if employed, feel that they 

must go to work in order to survive. Delivering 

food and groceries, stocking store shelves and 

any other kind of service work that they do — 

which actually enables more privileged people 

to remain comfortably at home and survive 

during the crisis — is precisely what African 

Americans who are in the working poor have to 

do in order to survive.” 

Catherine Lee, an Ann Arbor resident, 

is a mother of three. One of her sons is 

immunocompromised and her family has 

a history of diabetes. She said her family is 

working to manage these health conditions 

by incorporating a plant-based diet, but Lee 

acknowledged many families are not able to 

find better alternatives to manage these health 

concerns. 

“(Underlying health conditions are) mostly 

due to systematic racism. (African Americans) 

are sicker as a whole due to lack of education and 

resources when it comes to health. I know for 

our family, we started practicing a plant-based 

diet about three years ago and for a lot of people 

who look like us, that’s foreign,” Lee said. 

Racial bias in the medical field has also 

contributed to African Americans becoming 

more susceptible to COVID-19. Studies show 

doctors are less likely to test African Americans 

for COVID-19, which forces them to go through 

multiple visits before they can get a test.

Engineering 
freshman 
Temi 
Akinbola 

lives in Ypsilanti and touched on how African 

Americans are not treated equally by doctors 

due to a misconception that they are stronger. 

She said this misconception is preventing 

African Americans from getting tested for 

COVID-19.

“There’s also the fact that African Americans, 

just in the healthcare system, even if they have 

money, still aren’t treated the way they’re 

supposed to be treated,” Akinbola said. “There’s 

no reason that I’m three to four times more likely 

to die in childbirth than my equal counterpart. 

There’s a stigma that doctors have like, ‘African 

Americans are stronger, and stuff like that.’ 

But that’s not a reason to not pay attention to 

like whatever their patients may be saying and 

stuff like that. So there’s also the fact that some 

doctors just won’t test them based on race.”

What we can learn from Korea

A

s much as I would love to 

find a different topic to 

write about, the COVID-

19 pandemic has been the only 

relevant 
topic 
that 
has 
been 

updating itself for the past few 

weeks. The University of Michigan 

encouraged all students to return 

to their permanent residence, so I 

left Ann Arbor to fly back to South 

Korea last Saturday. When I finally 

stepped out of the airplane full of 

people sharing the same objective 

of reaching their homes after about 

14 hours of travel, I could see that 

my home country was dealing with 

the whole pandemic situation in a 

radically different manner.

It usually takes about 10 to 15 

minutes to get through the passport 

control and pick up your luggage at 

the Incheon International Airport. 

However, this time it took me an hour 

and a half. Several teams of airport 

staff members and public health 

workers lined up the passengers 

where they checked if all incoming 

passengers 
had 
downloaded 
a 

self-diagnosis tracking application 

on their phones. I was given 

more than enough information 

and 
explanation 
regarding 
the 

application and the need for us 

to download it to keep track of 

our health. Then, when I finally 

reached the actual checkpoint, 

a public health official checked 

my temperature with a simple 

electronic thermometer. I recorded 

98.6 degrees and was given a piece 

of paper that read “quarantine 

certificate.” I was then asked to fill 

out brief paperwork that asked for 

my address and phone number. 

When I asked the officer collecting 

the paperwork what this was for, 

he kindly answered that the Korean 

government newly mandated all its 

returning citizens to practice self-

quarantine for 14 days and those 

pieces of information were needed 

for the local government of my 

residence to check on my status. 

Out of curiosity, I then asked if 

there would be legal repercussions 

if I broke the self-quarantine and 

the answer was, as expected, 

yes. Noncompliance to the self-

quarantine order is punishable by 

up to a year of imprisonment or a 

fine up to 10,000,000 won, which is 

equivalent to almost $10,000. 

South Korea had two unique 

strategies dealing with COVID-19 

that the United States did not. The 

first was testing. Korea was much 

quicker to react to the global health 

crisis when compared to many other 

countries, partly because of its past 

experience with Middle Eastern 

Respiratory 
Syndrome 
(MERS) 
in 
2015. 

As soon as the first confirmed COVID-

19 case from China was announced, 

Korean companies jumped in on 

developing test kits. Beginning in 

late February, soon after the Lunar 

New Year holidays, Korea started 

to develop the capability of testing 

about 20,000 people a day and now 

has about 10,000 tests run per one 

million people, which is the highest 

confirmed data among all affected 

countries. 

The 
second 
strategy 
was 

heightened, 
yet 
relatively 
well-

accepted, surveillance on citizens. 

This does not mean that the Korean 

government wiretaps phone calls 

or collects all private information 

to track certain individuals down. 

Rather, the government effectively 

utilized the recent trend of cashless 

transactions and spiked use of 

smartphones to track people who 

came in contact with a confirmed 

patient. Korea has the highest 

proportion of cashless transactions 

and one of the highest phone 

ownership rates in the world. In 

addition, 
the 
government 
was 

able to successfully trace those in 

mandatory 14-day self-quarantine; 

the 
application 
I 
was 
told 
to 

download upon arrival was not only 

for self-diagnosis reporting but 

also for location tracking to notify 

the designated local government 

official if I leave my self-quarantine 

spot. 
The 
designated 
local 

government official calls me every 

morning to check if I am still in my 

self-quarantine spot and asks if I 

am showing any symptoms. Korean 

citizens, including myself, do not 

have much problem with being 

possibly traced or receiving phone 

calls from the local government 

every morning. Except for some 

outrageous cases of noncompliance 

to 
the 
self-quarantine 
order, 

including a South Korean student 

traveling to Jeju Island with her 

mother a day after arriving in 

Korea from the U.S., most citizens 

are taking social distancing fairly 

seriously. 

I am certainly not an expert in 

biomedical 
industries 
of 
either 

country but I doubt the U.S. lacks 

the technology or capital to develop 

testing kits. One of the crucial 

differences between Korea and the 

U.S. was the government’s attitude. 

President Trump dismissed the 

potential severity of the virus when 

it first emerged as a global health 

threat while consistently labeling 

it the “Chinese Virus.” President 

Trump had also poorly reorganized 

the 
National 
Security 
Council 

(NSC) so that it was not fit to react 

to pandemics like COVID-19. The 

Obama administration had done the 

same but restored the original NSC 

structure after going through the 

Ebola crisis in 2014. In addition, the 

Trump administration was recently 

found to have told the federal agency 

to classify COVID-19 deliberations, 

keeping crucial information like the 

scope of infection and quarantine 

restrictions from the public. While 

Korea learned from MERS in 2015, 

it seems as if the U.S. did not learn 

much from Ebola in 2014. 

I 
am 
not 
saying 
the 
U.S. 

should implement such a strict 

enforcement 
on 
self-quarantine 

and 
social 
distancing 
without 

much 
consideration. 
Americans 

could certainly react differently 

than Koreans if they were legally 

obligated to not leave their homes 

and local government agents kept 

track of them constantly. However, 

given the recent trend of ever-

increasing cases, some form of 

mandatory social distancing does 

not sound too egregious. The disease 

is not successfully being contained, 

especially in Michigan where the 

cases only continue to rise. Maybe 

the society as a whole really should 

consider a hard-hitting method like 

that of Korea to possibly bring the 

A

s 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer tackles the 

COVID-19 crisis, she 

has been met with criticism 

and attacks from President 

Donald Trump. The president 

neglects to mention her by 

name and instead resorts to 

“that woman from Michigan.” 

During his phone interview 

with Sean Hannity of Fox 

News, the president expressed 

concerns about our governor’s 

knowledge of the situation at 

hand. He went on to discount 

her efforts by claiming she 

was young and had no idea 

what was going on. While the 

president’s attacks seem out of 

place in the midst of a global 

pandemic, 
Gov. 
Whitmer 

and women in politics are all 

too familiar with persistent 

criticism and attacks meant to 

undermine their successes.

At the time of publication, 

the state of Michigan sits in 

fourth place for the number of 

confirmed COVID-19 cases in 

the United States. In response, 

Gov. Whitmer has stepped 

up to issue shelter-in-place 

orders, the closure of non-

essential businesses and the 

suspension of the in-person 

school year for public schools. 

The federal government has 

taken a free-for-all approach 

when it comes to the states 

and has pushed for governors 

to bid on supplies and not rely 

on the federal government’s 

support. In addition to this 

approach, 
President 
Trump 

advised Vice President Mike 

Pence not to call “the woman 

from Michigan” because she 

does not treat him right, again 

neglecting to refer to her by 

name.

The lack of recognition or 

support from colleagues is 

nothing new to Gov. Whitmer. 

She started her State of the 

State speech this year by saying 

“This is not the red carpet. 

Please, I urge you, focus on the 

substance of my speech. It’s 

about issues, not appearances.” 

This 
came 
after 
countless 

articles and posts shaming 

Whitmer for her appearance 

after 
her 
first 
address 
to 

the state as governor. Gov. 

Whitmer and other women 

in the public eye face societal 

stigmas as viewers and voters 

frequently focus on what they 

are wearing rather than what 

they are saying or doing. There 

is always a need for women in 

politics to be one step ahead 

and overly prepared in the 

face of misogyny. This reality 

is 
heavily 
perpetuated 
by 

the president as he elects to 

attack Gov. Whitmer rather 

than uniting a country facing 

mass casualties and economic 

catastrophe.

The extra hurdle women must 

clear in order to be at the same 

standing and consideration as 

men was personified by the 

“electability” argument in the 

2020 
Democratic 
primary. 

As many are painfully aware, 

the primary field began as the 

most diverse in history with a 

crowded race of women, racial 

minorities and the first major 

LGBTQ+ candidate. But, the 

flawed electability argument 

of how someone’s neighbor 

would vote and who could beat 

Donald Trump left us with 

a duo of white men over 70 

years old. This argument for 

electability turned out to be 

a veil of internalized racism 

and misogyny as the party 

that represents the broadest 

coalition of people of color 

and minority groups found 

itself 
with 
two 
privileged 

candidates.

The electability narrative 

allows for a greater level 

of criticism as 33 percent 

of Americans believe their 

neighbors 
and 
community 

members 
wouldn’t 
support 

a 
female 
candidate. 
The 

knowledge 
that 
those 

around us are apprehensive 

or unsupportive of women 

in positions of power has 

seemingly excused individuals’ 

lack of trust and support of 

women in politics. While 

women like Gov. Whitmer, 

a former Democratic Senate 

Leader and prosecutor, are 

qualified for the offices they 

hold, it is all too common to 

write them off as aggressive, 

young, 
inexperienced 
and 

pushy.

While 
President 
Trump 

has focused on how Gov. 

Whitmer’s calls for support are 

unappreciative, let us instead 

look to what she has done for 

our state during this time of 

unprecedented 
uncertainty. 

Within three days of our 

first 
cases, 
Gov. 
Whitmer 

announced 
the 
closure 
of 

our 
schools, 
banned 
large 

gatherings 
and 
announced 

restrictions on entry to health 

care and juvenile facilities 

to reduce the spread of the 

virus. Since her early response 

and 
action, 
Gov. 
Whitmer 

rolled out a long string of 

legislation, executive orders 

and trailblazing moves to limit 

COVID-19 in Michigan. This 

leadership by the governor has 

been overlooked and undercut 

by the president. His inability 

to address Gov. Whitmer by 

name, along with advice to 

withhold support from our 

state as we are overwhelmed 

by the virus, is reprehensible.

Our 
president 
frequently 

undermines the successes of 

public officials and attacks 

those at odds with his mission. 

While he does this, we must 

pay close attention to how 

he and those up and down 

the political totem poll treat 

and speak about women in 

positions 
of 
power. 
Many 

Americans 
assume 
those 

around them do not have faith 

in women in the political 

sphere as they write off and 

criticize women in relation to 

men. It’s past due for us to take 

it upon ourselves to look at the 

policies rather than the outfits 

and not participate in the herd 

mentality of electability when 

determining 
who 
is 
“best 

suited” for the job. And it’s 

past due for our president to 

refer to the governor strained 

for supplies and support by her 

name.

en. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 

I-Vt., will not be the 

Democratic 
nominee 

for president in 2020, just as 

he wasn’t the nominee in 2016. 

The 2016 run was the first time 

a number of left-wing ideas 

were reintroduced in the public 

square and they (and Sanders) 

consistently 
polled 
well. 

Though Hillary Clinton won the 

race, some Sanders supporters 

saw a moral victory and many 

saw better odds for him in 

2020; he was seen as one of the 

frontrunners from the first day 

of speculation surrounding this 

race.

How did it all fall apart? A 

primary reason is that people 

drew the wrong conclusions 

from the 2016 primary and thus 

went into 2020 with a misshapen 

strategy. 2016 was a unique 

primary for the Democrats — no 

one except Clinton was really 

in it. She immediately cleared 

the field as the Clintons have 

been bastions of Democratic 

politics since the 1980s, and 

there was no reason for people 

to risk crossing her when, in 

all likelihood, she would come 

out on top. Hillary and more 

broadly, the Clintons, were well-

liked within the party apparatus 

but she was thought to be better 

liked by the voters within the 

party than she actually was.

In other words, she was 

something of a paper tiger which 

Sanders (and his campaign) 

readily 
took 
advantage 
of. 

Photos 
of 
Sanders’s 
2015 

announcement of his first run 

are incredible in how sparsely 

attended they are. Within a year 

of this conference, Sanders was 

able to summon ten thousand to 

an arena with three days notice. 

Sanders 
wasn’t 
especially 

known but he was also not 

especially hidden — he had been 

on The Daily Show back when 

Jon Stewart was hosting it.

Sanders won more than 20 

contests in the 2016 primary 

but still lost by millions of 

votes nationwide. Because he 

was seen to have performed so 

strongly, there was immediate 

speculation 
about 
his 
2020 

plans. As the most left-wing 

candidate 
since 
George 

McGovern in the 1970s, Sanders 

was seen by many to be a 

frontrunner from nearly the day 

he entered the race. However, 

it faded slowly and eventually, 

former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 

Biden effectively locked up the 

nomination after a triumphant 

victory in South Carolina and a 

strong Super Tuesday showing.

The problem with Sanders’s 

2020 campaign was that it was 

built off the presumption that 

he did well in 2016 because 

people liked him. While this 

was part of it, a much bigger 

part of his support seemed 

to come from those seeking 

“ABC,” or “Anyone But Clinton.” 

The 
problem 
with 
building 

a 
strategy 
centered 
around 

having an incredibly unpopular 

person as the frontrunner is 

that it only works when there is 

an incredibly unpopular person 

as the frontrunner. There was 

one of those in 2016 but there 

wasn’t one in 2020 and as a 

result, Sanders saw far worse 

results.

Beyond this, the Sanders 

campaign was built on an 

expectation that the splintered 

field would endure far longer 

than it actually did. President 

Donald Trump was able to win 

the nomination in 2016 because 

there was no single anti-Trump 

candidate. There was former 

Gov. of Ohio John Kasich, Sens. 

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco 

Rubio, R-Fla., and so many 

more. None of them were able 

or willing to exit the race and so 

they continued splintering the 

vote. That wasn’t a problem on 

the Democratic side this year. 

Right before the start of Super 

Tuesday a number of moderate 

candidates who would have 

split Biden’s vote dropped out, 

including 
former 
Mayor 
of 

South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg, 

and 
Sen. 
Amy 
Klobuchar, 

D-Minn. After this, Biden held a 

Texas rally where many former 

candidates 
(including 
ones 

that had dropped out earlier) 

endorsed him. This support, 

combined with Biden’s strong 

Super Tuesday showing ensured 

he would be the nominee.

Looking forward however, 

not all is lost. Biden will 

probably have a more liberal 

platform than either of the 

previous times he was on the top 

of the ticket. Consequently, his 

governance will in all likelihood 

be to the left of Barack Obama. 

But, if Sanders (or someone 

subscribing to his theory of 

politics) is to run and win, they 

must first accept that both a 

strategy of having an unpopular 

avatar 
for 
middlebrow 

liberalism and a strategy of 

counting on a splintered field 

are good ideas in theory, but 

don’t tend to hold in practice.

T

here have been four global 

recessions 
to 
date: 
1975, 

1982, 1991 and 2009 with 

2020 currently being added to this 

list. The economic downfall that we 

are experiencing due to the COVID-

19 pandemic is predicted to exceed 

any of the previous recessions. Over 

ten million Americans applied for 

unemployment 
benefits 
in 
March 

alone. The number of jobs lost due 

to COVID-19 in the last two weeks is 

comparable to the total jobs lost over 

a span of two years during the Great 

Recession. The intense restrictions 

placed on businesses are leading to 

not only a deep but also long-lasting 

downturn in the economy. Every 

region of the world is experiencing 

this financial crisis. However, there is 

one business that seems to be booming 

during this cataclysm — Amazon.com, 

Inc.

People are lenient to spend money 

right now, but the money that is being 

spent is concentrated in online delivery 

businesses. While most companies 

are laying off employees, Amazon.

com Inc. is expected to hire 100,000 

new employees in order to meet the 

consumer demands for home deliveries. 

The convenience of having groceries, 

toiletries, dog food, etc., arriving at 

your doorstep is appreciable, especially 

during a pandemic.

However, convenience comes with a 

cost, and Amazon employees are paying 

the toll. 

While most of the world is motivating 

people to stay home and flatten the 

curve, Amazon is encouraging the 

opposite. The company raised wages 

$2 an hour and offered overtime at 

double the hourly rate. Instead of 

doing everything to protect its workers, 

Amazon is going against government 

shelter in place orders and jeopardizing 

employee health. At some locations, 

employees 
are 
working 
without 

masks, proper gloves, hand sanitizer 

or wipes, making Amazon warehouses 

playgrounds for the virus. More than 

50 of their warehouses already have 

confirmed cases of COVID-19. 

The company informs its employees 

only after word has already leaked 

to the press about confirmed cases. 

Many employees walked off the job 

once they heard of confirmed cases 

of COVID-19 in their warehouse, 

leaving the remaining employees with 

twice as much work to do. Amazon 

employees have organized workplace 

walkouts and held protests outside 

the warehouses trying to prove that 

their health is just as essential as any 

package. 

Amazon agreed to pay for two 

weeks of sick time off for individuals 

that were diagnosed with the virus. 

Many employees who believed that 

they needed to self-quarantine due 

to compromised immune systems or 

because they had come in contact with 

others who tested positive were not 

eligible for this paid time off. Owing 

to this policy, many employees worked 

while exhibiting symptoms since they 

had to wait for their test results to 

receive the time off. These employees 

could have been spreading the virus 

abundantly throughout the warehouse 

for up to two weeks. Additionally, 

there is limited access to COVID-19 

tests, making paid time off even less 

attainable. This policy has been mildly 

adjusted to accommodate employees 

who are caring for family members 

with COVID-19. 

The warehouse in Queens, New York, 

had the first publicly known case of 

COVID-19. The company shut down the 

warehouse for two days for cleaning, 

but employees returned to work as 

normal 
shortly 
after. 
Frustrations 

have risen among warehouse workers 

as they continue to move extraneous 

products. It is hard to comprehend that 

the company would risk the health of 

hundreds of thousands of employees to 

ship items such as puzzles or books.

The 
divide 
between 
what 
is 

essential 
and 
nonessential 
seems 

to 
be 
misinterpreted 
by 
Amazon 

headquarters. Home delivery orders 

are surging for all kinds of products and 

fulfilling these orders is asking workers 

to put themselves at risk. Corporate 

profit is being valued over employees 

during this public health crisis. Before 

placing a nonessential order, we must 

consider if the convenience is worth 

the cost.

“Tigertail” is a triumph. As in the best 

movies, its characters leap off the screen 

and will be remembered like old friends. The 

story in “Tigertail” is so fleshed out, so filled 

with emotion, that it feels like a memoir, not 

a fictional narrative. The film tells the life 

story of Pin-Jui, a Taiwanese immigrant to the 

US. It flashes between Pin-Jui’s elderly self, 

played excellently by Tzi Ma (“Arrival”) and 

his memories — chronicling his childhood, 

teenage years and how he left his life in Taiwan 

for the States.

Quiet moments, like older Pin Jui washing 

dishes and making tea, are filled with decades 

of formative memories. They run from sublime 

peace, like young Jui running along a river 

babbling through a rice field, to wrenching 

heartbreak, like teenage Jui leaving the 

love of his life. Tzi Ma is the anchor of it all, 

giving a piercing, yet painstakingly subtle, 

performance. He can convey a lifetime of 

emotions without uttering a word. 

In most other movies, Pin-Jui’s older self 

would be a background character, or even 

an antagonist. He’s cold, quiet and angry. 

There’s a particularly jarring moment when 

he screams at his young daughter Angela 

(Christine Ko, “Stumptown”) for crying after 

a botched piano performance. This distance 

and harshness continues as Angela grows up 

and worsens once his wife leaves him. Yet Pin-

Jui’s memories explain this mindset, showing 

his arranged marriage 

and choice to move to 

the States in search of 

opportunity, 
leaving 

his 
girlfriend 
and 

mother in Taiwan. 

For Pin-Jui and his 

wife, the American 

Dream was a rundown 

apartment 
complex 

in 1970s New York, 

where nobody spoke 

their 
language. 

Jui 
worked 
at 
a 

pharmacy day in and 

day out, ignoring his 

loneliness, 
isolation 

and culture shock. While he made money, it 

cost him his loved ones. The film shows his 

attempt to get them back. 

Is he too far gone? Can one go so far away 

from home that there is no going back?

Writer-director Alan Yang (“Master of 

None”) is a master of setting, and his eye for 

imagery frames Pin-Jui’s life with an almost 

mythic visual excellence. Be it a neon-tinted, 

Taiwanese nightclub or a crumbling house 

overgrown with tropical foliage, one sees Jui’s 

triumphs and losses reflected in every frame. 

This does not come across as inauthentic, as 

everyone gives their own memories hyperbolic 

weight. 

While Taiwanese culture and history are 

integral to the film, 

responding to a kind 

of 
representation 

needed 
in 
2020’s 

cinematic landscape, 

there’s a universality 

to 
his 
story 
that 

fits all walks of life. 

Hasn’t everyone left 

home at some time or 

another and regretted 

it? One will end the 

film in contemplation, 

perhaps even deciding 

to change one’s own 

life, taking that visit 

to Mom or calling that 

long lost friend. 

“Tigertail” 
is 
the 
type 
of 
authentic, 

piercing cinema that only comes around once 

in a while. There’s no conventionality, no 

over-sentimentalized, happy ending and no 

stereotypes. Just humanity, plain and simple. 

In a time when people are growing increasingly 

divided, movies like this serve as reminders 

that the silver screen is the great equalizer. No 

matter where we come from, we just want to 

find our way back home.

‘Tigertail’ brings the conventions of memoir to film

FILM REVIEW

John Prine was the best to ever do it, plain and 

simple. It’s the objective truth. When Johnny 

Cash, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, three 

giants in the American songwriting scene, 

all claim that someone is the best American 

songwriter of all time, you have no choice but 

to listen, and John Prine was that someone. In 

terms of commercial success, Prine pales in 

comparison to the aforementioned behemoths, 

but in terms of legacy and influence, he’s right 

up there with them, maybe even a tier above. 

Since 1971, he has had a steady outpouring of 

music, having released his most recent record, 

the outstanding Tree of Forgiveness, in 2018. His 

music has influenced artists ranging from Bon 

Iver and Kurt Vile to Kacey Musgraves and Jason 

Isbell, among countless others.

On Mar. 19, his wife Fiona announced she had 

been diagnosed with COVID-19. However, she 

assured fans that Prine had been quarantined 

in their house apart from her. On Mar. 26, she 

revealed Prine had been admitted to the hospital 

due to corona-like symptoms. He was later 

intubated and in critical condition as of Mar. 28. 

A few days ago, on Apr. 7, he died of complications 

related to COVID-19, at age 73. Prine was a 

fighter, having beaten both squamous cell cancer 

on the right side of his neck in 1993 and cancer in 

his left lung in 2013, returning to the tour circuit 

after only a few months of recovery. Given his age 

and compromised immune system, though, he 

just couldn’t get past coronavirus, despite taking 

extensive measures to protect himself.

It’s hard to accept that he’s gone, especially 

considering the circumstances, but it’s clear that 

he will not be forgotten. It may be cliche to say 

this, but his spirit will live on through his music. 

John Prine was the first artist that really stuck 

with me. And when I say stuck with me, I mean 

that he grabbed me and never let go. 

I remember the very first time I heard a John 

Prine song. I was in middle school, frenzied to 

find something to replace the tired old songs that, 

thanks to the disc jockeys at the local classic rock 

station, spewed endlessly from the radio in my 

parents’ kitchen. It’s not that I hated these songs, 

but I had heard them all thousands of times. I 

needed something fresh, so every night before I 

went to sleep, I would spend hours creating and 

wading through Pandora stations, waiting for 

something to grab my ear. After one especially 

late night, I finally found exactly what I was 

looking for. I had never heard anything like it 

before, but I knew that it was just what I needed.

It was a live version of “Illegal Smile” from 

Prine’s self-titled debut album, recorded in 1988 

at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 

Calif. It was love at first listen. It was everything 

I had hoped for. It’s a silly song about smiling 

at things that aren’t funny, aided perfectly by a 

gently looping acoustic guitar. Prine’s charisma 

is immediately apparent as he banters back and 

forth with audience members and adlibs phrases 

like “Well done / Song of a gun / Hot dog bun / 

Attilla the Hun / My Sister … is a nun!” It’s hard 

not to be spellbound by “Illegal Smile.” It has 

everything that makes John Prine the best to 

ever do it, from the simple but not dumb lyrics to 

his friendly, familiar croak. It’s sharp, funny and 

empathetic, even if its lyrics don’t always make 

sense. It was the perfect introduction to John 

Prine.

Though it was impossible for Prine to become 

acquainted with all his fans — although I’m sure 

he would have liked to — he had the unique ability 

to touch each and every person who listened to 

his records. He simply understood people and did 

what he could to help them. Everyone has their 

own favorite John Prine song and few have the 

same favorite John Prine song because his songs 

covered every state of the human condition. Take 

1978’s “Fish and Whistle,” for example. Prine 

ponders why we choose the paths we go down 

in life and the mistakes that go along with those 

choices. “Father forgive us for what we must do 

/ You forgive us, we’ll forgive you / We’ll forgive 

each other until we both turn blue / Then we’ll 

whistle and go fishing in Heaven,” he sings on 

each chorus that rests between descriptions of 

undesirable scenarios. Prine carefully examines 

situations like working a job only to quit because 

you’re afraid of bees and are only being paid 50 

cents an hour, or joining the army and repairing 

heavy machinery only to use your time off to go 

out drinking. Prine knew that everyone regrets 

some of the things they’ve done in the past, but 

that these things are the only way a person can 

grow and become who they really are. And in 

the end, everyone will end up in the same place, 

regardless of what they’ve done. This song, and 

all of Prine’s songs for that matter, are why he 

resonates with so many people.

At times, Prine was even defiant. On “Your 

Flag Decal Won’t Get You Into Heaven Anymore” 

off his 1971 self-titled debut, he protested the 

senseless killing and false valor that comes with 

war. He sets it all up in a way that only he could: 

humorously, with great care and sensitivity. In 

the opening verse he sings, “While digesting 

Reader’s Digest / In the back of the dirty book 

store / A plastic flag with gum on the back / Fell 

out on the floor,” going on to describe the feeling of 

superiority and pride that comes with displaying 

your patriotism for everyone to witness, even 

going as far as to stick these little plastic flags all 

over his car and his wife. However, he denounces 

this overt patriotism in the chorus as he softly 

lampoons, “But your flag decal won’t get you into 

heaven anymore / They’re already overcrowded 

from your dirty little war / Now Jesus don’t like 

killin’, no matter what the reason’s for.” The song 

provides scathing commentary on the suffering 

that blind patriotism can cause and demonstrates 

Prine’s astonishing ability to tackle difficult 

subjects with grace and poise while also making 

sure that each word he sings drives his point 

deeper and deeper into his listeners.

John Prine found himself at home making 

songs to fit a variety of moods, but he was often 

at his best when he was making heartbreakingly 

warm and saccharinely sad music, a tone he 

employed in much of his late music. His final 

record, The Tree of Forgiveness, is filled with 

this type of music. The most notable example, 

however, is the record’s closing track “When I 

Get to Heaven.” The song is largely a spoken-

word list of the all things he’s going to do once 

he gets to heaven, only breaking form during the 

chorus as he erupts, “And then I’m gonna get a 

cocktail: vodka and ginger ale / Yeah, I’m gonna 

smoke a cigarette that’s nine miles long / I’m 

gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl / 

‘Cause this old man is goin’ to town.” Prine knew 

his time was bound to come and decided to use 

this song to make sure that something as sad as 

his death would be thought of as a happy thing, a 

way for him to do all of the things that he couldn’t 

do while he was alive.

‘One of those classic races’: Kevin Sullivan and the 2000 Olympics

Kevin Sullivan stood at the 

line and took it all in.

It was the Canadian’s first 

Olympic games, and it was 

electric. 110,000 people filled 

Stadium Australia on the night 

of Sept. 29, 2000. They were 

anxiously waiting to see one of 

the deepest fields in Olympic 

history try to capture glory for 

themselves and their country. 

“It’s like you’re in Michigan 

Stadium 
for 
a 
track 
and 

field meet,” Sullivan, now 

the track and field coach 

for 
the 
Wolverines, 
said. 

“It’s not something you see 

every weekend. So from that 

perspective, it’s a little bit of an 

eye opening experience.”

On your mark.

Sullivan 
hunched 
over, 

anticipating the sound of the 

gun that would send him and 11 

other men into a race that could 

define their careers.

The official raised an arm 

high into the night sky and 

fired. The runners were off.

***

Flashback to the summer of 

2000, Sullivan was preparing 

to qualify for Sydney after 

missing 
out 
on 
the 
1996 

Olympics due to injury. He was 

confident and running as well 

as he ever had before, setting 

personal bests in the mile, the 

1500-meter and 1000-meter all 

in the months leading up to the 

trials in August. As expected, 

he qualified and then set his 

sights to September’s Olympic 

games.

“When 
you 
miss 
one 

(Olympic games), you’re not 

sure if you’re ever going to get 

back again,” Sullivan said. “So, 

for me there was that sense of 

oh yeah, I’m still the athlete I 

was four years ago or better.”

Sullivan built a level of 

confidence 
heading 
into 

Sydney. Leading up to the start 

of the games he beat every 

runner in the field except 

the eventual gold and silver 

medalists — Moroccan runner 

Hicham 
El 
Guerrouj 
and 

Kenyan runner Noah Ngeny. 

He knew he could compete 

with the best runners in the 

world, and he was ready to 

show it.

***

Sullivan jostled for position 

on the back straight, and the 

race started shaping into what 

he had expected. Moroccan 

runner Youssef Baba grabbed 

the lead around the 200-meter 

mark and strung out the field 

with a blistering pace. Baba 

wouldn’t be able to keep this 

up and he knew that, this was 

just to help his teammate El 

Guerrouj — the world record 

holder in the 1500-meter — by 

turning it into an honest race 

just as El Guerrouj likes it. 

The Moroccans employed this 

strategy frequently whenever 

they had a second runner 

alongside El Guerrouj.

“As soon as the second 

Moroccan made the final, our 

coaching staff and I were pretty 

confident in what was gonna 

happen,” Sullivan said. “So 

from that perspective, it wasn’t 

a surprise when it went out that 

way, we were pretty prepared 

for that.”

Led by Baba, that first lap 

went by in a scorching 54 

seconds. Sullivan described 

that beginning as a “shock to the 

system” after having run two 

races earlier in the week. But, 

standing back around eighth 

place, he wasn’t panicking. He 

was ready to move up.

Then, the second lap came 

and with it, a blessing to 

everyone in the field — except 

El Guerrouj. Baba fell off pace 

earlier than expected and 

posted a 60-second lap that 

allowed the entire field back 

into the race. Sullivan worked 

his way up into sixth place, a 

spot that put him in position to 

cover a move by El Guerrouj.

***

But first, before looking at 

Sullivan’s finish, it’s important 

to look back at how he even got 

to the finals. A few hundredths 

of a second separated him from 

his opponents in the semifinals. 

If not for those key seconds, 

he’d have missed the chance 

to compete for a medal on the 

world’s biggest stage.

Sullivan 
always 
found 

preliminary races to be more 

stressful than finals. His heat of 

the quarterfinal is an example 

why. It was a tactical race early 

on, with no one wanting to take 

the pace out of themselves. So, 

they ran together, congested, 

waiting for someone to make 

a move. As the race started 

heating up, all the runners were 

fresh and could keep up with 

the pack.

“With 200 to go, all 12 guys 

were still in it,” Sullivan said. 

“So that one is one where it’s a 

super stressful situation until 

it really starts rolling. And 

then, when you’re in that last 

lap it’s more about trying to be 

in position, and trying to make 

sure you’re going as hard as you 

need to, and hopefully being 

able to conserve a little bit so 

that you got something left on 

the home stretch.”

Sullivan 
conserved 
just 

enough for that last 100 meters. 

He powered down the home 

stretch to come in fourth 

place and earned one of the 

automatic qualifying spots. The 

runner in seventh place — the 

first spot without an automatic 

qualification — was just 0.26 

seconds behind Sullivan. 

The semifinal went more 

smoothly. Sullivan had a great 

race and came in second in 

his heat, securing the bid for 

the final. He now had only 

one race left in Sydney. And 

it was one where he could 

prove everything if he finished 

highly enough against the elite 

runners that awaited him.

***

Whether it was the taxing 

races leading up to the final or 

the breakneck speed of the first 

lap, Sullivan didn’t respond 

very well to El Guerrouj’s move 

with 600 meters remaining. He 

got shuffled back to seventh as 

the pack strung out once again. 

As 
the 
bell 
sounded 

signifying the final lap, all eyes 

were on El Guerrouj. He was 

in first place followed closely 

by Ngeny and Bernard Lagat 

of Kenya. Sullivan was in 

sixth place just behind Spain’s 

Andrés Diaz. With 300 meters 

to go, he found his way into 

fifth. Sullivan was still out of 

reach of the leaders. 

“In hindsight, I don’t know 

if I would’ve been in a medal 

position, ” Sullivan said. “But I 

could’ve been closer to fourth 

had I positioned myself better 

a little bit in the middle of the 

race.”

Sullivan became merely a 

bystander to what unfolded in 

the front pack over the final 

200 meters. El Guerrouj was 

desperately holding onto first 

place fueled by the expectations 

of his country and the world, 

but Ngeny and Lagat were 

breathing on El Guerrouj’s 

neck. With 100 meters to go El 

Guerrouj tried to open up, but 

the effects of leading for the last 

500m weighed on him. 

Ngeny had just a little bit 

more to give. He sprinted 

past a pained El Guerrouj and 

snatched the gold. He posted 

an Olympic record time of 

3:32.07. He was closely followed 

by El Guerrouj — who would 

have to wait until 2004 to 

finally capture an Olympic gold 

— in second and his teammate 

Bernard Lagat in third. 

Meanwhile, 
Sullivan 

sprinted away from the rest of 

the chase pack over the final 

300 meters to capture fifth 

with a time of 3:35.50. After 

two more Olympics, it would 

still be his highest ever finish. 

“2000 was obviously the 

highlight for a couple of 

reasons,” Sullivan said. “It 

was my first games, it was the 

one I performed the best, and 

it was the best in terms of the 

venues, the atmosphere and the 

crowds, those were all better 

experiences than Athens and 

Beijing.”

Sullivan fondly looks back at 

this race and the spectacle of it 

all. The talent, the storylines, 

everything that came together 

to make this one of the most 

memorable 
Olympic 
1500-

meter races ever. 

Or, as Sullivan put it, “One of 

those classic races.”

Boxing, taekwando teams face removal from club sport status

In the midst of collegiate 

sports being canceled due 

to 
COVID-19, 
Michigan’s 

boxing and taekwando club 

teams have found themselves 

in limbo.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Recreational 

Sports 
Department, 
in 

collaboration 
with 
the 

office of Risk Management, 

decided to revoke both teams’ 

status as a club sport based 

on audits, forcing them to 

become Voluntary Student 

Organizations (VSOs). 

“Their initial argument 

is about risk management,” 

Michigan 
Boxing 
Club 

President 
Maya 
Irigoyen 

said. The Recreational Sports 

Department did not respond 

to 
The 
Daily’s 
request 

for comment in time for 

publication.

The physicalities of both 

of these sports were enough 

to drive the University to 

take severe action despite the 

value that the partnerships 

provide.

Michigan’s taekwondo club 

— founded in 1964 — is the 

oldest collegiate taekwondo 

club 
and 
continues 
to 

represent the University at 

the national and international 

level.

Aside from the success 

members of the team achieve 

on each level, they also 

represent a variety of cultures 

and communities throughout 

campus. 

“This 
eclectic 
mix 
of 

people 
coming 
from 
all 

over the world creates an 

environment that transcends 

cultural bounds, commonly 

held thoughts about who does 

sports ... and an environment 

who is accepting of all,” 

taekwando 
club 
president 

Liam Blanchard said. “As 

much of a cliche as it is, 

taekwondo is a family.”

The removal of club status 

would harm its ability to 

provide the same level of 

resources to its members.

“All 
of 
our 
practices 

require practice space, which 

is largely provided to us at 

no extra cost through Club 

Sports,” 
Blanchard 
said. 

“This change would then 

have us rent all of our space, 

as many of the free spaces on 

campus cannot accomodate 

a group of our size. With 

the price of insurance, cost 

of renting space, and our 

current club funding, this 

would essentially lead the 

club into financial ruin.”

The Michigan boxing club 

plays a similarly positive 

role to its members. Without 

sponsorship, the club will 

also be hampered. 

“Losing 
sponsorship 

for 
club 
boxing 
would 

mean we would have to 

become a voluntary student 

organization 
to 
remain 

on campus, which is not 

viable,” boxing club treasurer 

Michael 
Zlonkevicz 
said. 

“We lose the ability to use 

any U-M names, logos, or 

indicia. This will impact our 

reputation on campus and our 

ability to fight in collegiate 

tournaments.”

Added Zlonkevicz: “Losing 

sponsorship 
would 
mean 

we are no longer able to 

participate in Giving Blueday. 

Shrinking 
a 
substantial 

revenue stream for us and 

likely causing us to raise 

dues, which no one wants. We 

would lose U-M insurance 

coverage as well, adding to 

our new costs if we were to be 

a VSO.”

The teams were granted a 

year extension for the appeal 

deadline — moving it back 

to April 1, 2021 — in order to 

accomodate for the COVID-

19 crisis.

The decision has not been 

made final, and both teams 

continue to put together 

appeals in an attempt to 

regain their club status. 

“We have been working 

on our appeal,” Irigoyen 

said. “We’ve been … citing 

a bunch of rules from the 

rulebook that establish what 

the safety precautions are. … 

We’ve been getting personal 

statements, reaching out to 

alumni, current members, 

other schools just to show the 

impact that this would have.”

The efforts to petition are 

ongoing, and diverse. Alumni 

and even other teams from 

other schools have offered 

assistance, as well. 

“In light of our decision, 

boxing clubs from Ohio State, 

Wisconsin and Georgetown 

have written letters speaking 

on our impact in the sport 

and how boxing has impacted 

their campus communities,” 

Zlonkevicz said.

Added Irigoyen: “It is just 

a very frustrating thing when 

it feels like the school, who 

is supposed to be sponsoring 

a team who has won them 

many 
championships 
and 

who represents the school 

very well … are just coming 

after us to get rid of us.”

Quinten Johnson preparing for bigger role in sophomore year

Quinten 
Johnson 

knew that he didn’t go 

to Michigan to star as a 

freshman. Recruited as a 

multi-dimensional 
four-

star defensive back in the 

Wolverines’ 
2019 
class, 

he 
knew 
he 
wouldn’t 

immediately 
usurp 
their 

crop of established starters.

What he didn’t know is 

that he would spend his 

entire 
freshman 
season 

watching 
from 
afar, 

sidelined by a groin injury 

that required season-ending 

surgery.

“He was a guy who was 

always 
playing, 
always 

on the field, always doing 

something for us,” Mike 

Ward, Johnson’s defensive 

coordinator at St. John’s 

College 
High 
School 
in 

Washington D.C., said last 

week. “And being injured, it 

isn’t easy, especially when 

you’re used to being a dude.”

That pain of not seeing 

the 
field, 
though, 
was 

countered by a knowledge 

that 2019 was a part of the 

process. Most around the 

program envision Johnson 

as a VIPER — a position 

where he has an immediate 

path to playing time in 2020 

after 
Khaleke 
Hudson’s 

graduation. 
And 
with 

multiple potential positions 

for 
him 
in 
Michigan’s 

secondary, Johnson knew 

he could spend his freshman 

fall learning from those 

around him.

All of that was supposed 

to build toward the 15 

practices 
that 
comprise 

spring ball. It’s a time of year 

seemingly custom-built for 

players like Johnson, with 

seniors already departed, 

but without the frenzied 

stress of fall camp.

Then came March 12.

Just four days before 

the 
start 
of 
Michigan’s 

spring 
practices, 
the 

NCAA canceled all winter 

and 
spring 
sports 
amid 

the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Instead of returning to the 

field and making his case as 

Hudson’s successor, Johnson 

was suddenly heading home 

to Washington.

He spent the next week 

working out at St. John’s 

to stay in football shape, 

before 
it 
too 
canceled 

classes, shutting down its 

football facilities in the 

process. Now, he’s trapped 

at home, attempting to fill 

the void left by spring ball’s 

cancelation with workouts 

that the Michigan staff has 

sent home to every player.

Still, Ward isn’t concerned 

about his development.

“I think it says a lot about 

(Johnson) that the first day 

he’s home, he comes into St. 

John’s and works out,” Ward 

said. “… (He) is not one of 

those guys that you have to 

worry about getting better.”

Even with the departures 

of Lavert Hill at cornerback 

and Josh Metellus at safety, 

it’s a development path likely 

aimed toward VIPER, where 

he and junior Mike Barrett 

are the leading candidates 

to replace Hudson. Though 

St. John’s doesn’t play with a 

VIPER, the position — which 

acts as a hybrid safety/

linebacker 
in 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown’s 

defense — maximizes many 

of Johnson’s strengths.

“(Brown) 
is 
gonna 

put kids in a spot to be 

successful 
where 
their 

skillset lies,” Ward said. 

“And I think (Johnson) is 

obviously physically gifted, 

but he’s very intelligent, he 

can cover, he has great ball 

skills, he can tackle, he’s big, 

he’s strong. He did a lot of 

the same things — in terms 

of us having the VIPER 

position, no, but in terms of 

what’s asked of the VIPER 

position, yes.”

It’s the reason Brown and 

his staff recruited Johnson 

to Ann Arbor two years ago, 

even without seeing him 

play the position in high 

school. “I just think it was 

a perfect fit,” Ward said. 

“A lot of times, you’re like, 

‘Why is this kid going here?’ 

And with Q, just in terms of 

the academics, the fit with 

coach Brown, the fit with 

coach (Jim) Harbaugh, the 

fit as a program, I thought it 

was a great marriage all the 

way around.”

Now, of course, it’s also 

where the loss of spring 

ball hits hardest. Stuck at 

home, Johnson can recoup 

some of his missed lifting 

sessions 
and 
workouts. 

But on the field, there’s no 

replacement for those 15 

missed workouts.

In shock move, Christopher spurns ‘M’ for Arizona State at final hour

On Monday night, Juwan 

Howard’s 
first 
recruiting 

class had the chance to come 

full circle with the addition 

of 
five-star 
guard 
Josh 

Christopher.

But 
as 
it 
turns 
out, 

Christopher had other ideas. 

The 10th-ranked recruit in 

the 
247Sports 
composite 

rankings, 
he 
spurned 

Michigan — the perceived 

leader in his recruitment 

— when he announced his 

commitment to Arizona State 

via Twitter.

He 
would’ve 
been 

Michigan’s 
highest-

ranked recruit since LaVell 

Blanchard, the No. 6 overall 

prospect in the class of 1999. 

From 
the 
Wolverines’ 

side, Christopher’s formal 

commitment punctuates a 

lengthy 
recruitment 
that 

began only a week after 

Howard was introduced as 

the new Michigan men’s 

basketball coach last May. 

While UCLA was initially 

viewed 
as 
the 
team 
to 

beat 
in 
his 
recruitment, 

multiple 
reports 
claimed 

the sweepstakes ultimately 

evolved into a two-horse race 

between the Wolverines and 

Arizona State.

In 
January, 
recruiting 

analysts began identifying 

Michigan as the leader, and 

eleven consecutive Crystal 

Ball 
predictions 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ favor trickled in 

on 247Sports over the span 

of six weeks. But 10 months 

after 
becoming 
Howard’s 

first offer, Christopher is 

Tempe-bound.

Christopher’s 
older 

brother just finished his 

freshman season at Arizona 

State, 
where 
he 
played 

sparingly. Christopher chose 

the Sun Devils over Michigan, 

the hometown Bruins and 

Missouri, where his cousin is 

the men’s basketball strength 

and conditioning coach.

Many view Christopher 

as one of the elite scorers 

in the 2020 class, but his 

passing 
and 
perimeter 

defense also stand out from 

his game tape. The 6-foot-5, 

220-pound shooting guard 

already has a pro-ready body. 

He 
likely 
would’ve 
been 

part of Michigan’s starting 

backcourt next season, and 

his ability to score at all three 

levels 
could’ve 
provided 

instant offense.

Even 
without 

Christopher’s 
pledge, 
the 

Wolverines boast the nation’s 

No. 4 recruiting class — their 

highest-ranked haul since 

247Sports’ rankings began 

two decades ago. The class 

features 
five-star 
power 

forward Isaiah Todd, four-

star center Hunter Dickinson, 

four-star guard Zeb Jackson, 

four-star forward Terrance 

Williams 
and 
three-star 

walk-on 
forward 
Jace 

Howard, Juwan’s son.

With 
Christopher’s 

commitment 
to 
Arizona 

State, 
Michigan 
has 
one 

remaining 
scholarship 

available for the 2020-21 

season. 
The 
Wolverines 

remain in contention for 

five-star 
power 
forward 

Greg Brown, who is set 

to 
announce 
his 
college 

decision on Apr. 24, though 

Texas and Auburn are widely 

considered the favorites in 

his recruitment.
