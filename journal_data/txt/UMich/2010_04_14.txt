The NCAAis investigatingpoten-
tial rules violations regarding West
Virginia University's football pro-
gram during the time that Michigan
football coach Rich Rodriguez was
at the helm in Morgantown, multi-
ple news outlets reported yesterday.
A source familiar with the situa-
tion atWest VirginiatoldESPN.com
that the allegations focus on Rodri-
guez, who coached at West Virginia
from2001to2008.
The news comes amid the
NCAA's current investigation of
the University of Michigan football
program concerning potential rules
violations and a source with knowl-
edge of that probe told the Detroit
Free Press yesterday that the inves-
tigation into WVU's program is an
offshoot of the investigation into
Michigan's football program.
University of Michigan officials
announced on Feb. 23 that they
received a notice of allegations from
the NCAA, which charged the foot-
ball program with violating regula-

tions infive areas.
The notice alleged that the foot-
ball program had violated rules
regarding the number of coaches
allowed to work with student-ath-
letes and that the program violated
rules regarding the maximum hours
allotted for mandatory practice
time.
In addition, the notice alleges
that Rodriguez "failed to promote
an atmosphere of compliance with-
in the football program."
According to ESPN.com, West
Virginia officials refused to com-
ment on the specifics of the allega-
tions against the Mountaineers,
but they did acknowledge that the
NCAA has met with and inter-
viewed university officials.
"The NCAA has met with indi-
viduals involved with the West Vir-
ginia football program to identify
any potential rules violations,"West
Virginia officials said in the state-
ment, according to multiple news
outlet. "The university has fully
cooperated with the NCAA during
this process. West Virginia Univer-
sity and its department of intercol-
legiate athletics is committed to
operating its athletics department
in conformance with the legislation
and policies of the NCAA and the
Big East Conference."

How 'U' addresses
disability issues a
concern for students
at fireside chat
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In a small group meeting with
students yesterday, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
addressed a number of concerns

raised by those assembled, includ-
ing issues regarding students with
disabilities on campus and the Uni-
versity's Smoke Free Initiative.
At the fireside chat - a monthly
meeting with invited students
held by Coleman and University
Vice President for Student Affairs
Royster Harper - students voiced
concern with how the University
handles issues relating to students
with disabilities.
Rackham student Katie Peth-
an suggested that the Univer-
sity should take a more proactive

approach in reaching out to stu-
dents with disabilities. Pethan said
some departments are better than
others at assisting students with
disabilities, but she would like to
see more action taken throughout
the University.
Pethan said it's often difficult
for incoming graduate and under-
graduate students to know what
resources are actually available to
them. However, she acknowledged
that in order for the University to
offer any help, disabled students
need to inform the University of

their disability.
"I would like to open the discus-
sion about how to create a proac-
tive, perhaps an orientation, for
students who self identify after
they've been admitted," Pethan
said in an interview after the event.
In response to Pethan's con-
cerns, Harper said the Univer-
sity needs to remove the stigma
in students' minds about identify-
ing themselves as disabled, add-
ing that the University's system

University officials announced
yesterday that Joseph Rosa, the
chief curator of architecture and

design at the Art Institute of Chi-
cago, will be the next director of
the University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art.
Rosa will take the post effec-
tive July 1, pending approval by
the University's Board of Regents.
He will be the seventh director of
UMMA, succeeding James Stew-
ard who left the University in 2009
after 11 years, during which he
oversaw a major capital campaign
and a construction and renovation
project to accept the directorship

at the Princeton University Art
Museum.
When Rosa begins the job, he
will be taking over for a team of
three interim co-directors that
have headed the museum since
June 2009.
Rosa was selected after an
international search conducted
by a 14-member advisory commit-

With resolution, MSA pushes for greater
student involvement in smoking ban plans

University official

dangerous'
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
The University has suspended
University-sponsored student
r travel to areas in northern Mex-

ico due to the increasing fighting
between Mexican drug cartels in
the region, according to an e-mail
sent to the University community
yesterday.
The University's International
Travel Oversight Committee has
reviewed travel security in states
including Nuevo Leon, Coahuila,
Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango,
Sinaloa and Baja California,
where violent incidents have
occurred in the last few months.
After its inspection, the Univer-

sity decided to suspend travel to
these areas.
The U.S. Department of State
announced a travel warning
in March to inform citizens of
the risks of traveling to areas in
northern Mexico - specifically
cities like Tijuana, Nogales, Ciu-
dad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Mon-
terrey and Matamoros - which
have experienced an increase in
crimes and violence.

Haven joins Mason Hall

Today, thousands of stu-
dents walk through Mason and
Haven halls without realizing
that the two were once sepa-
rated.
But in 1999, the University
Board of Regents approved
renovations that would con-
nect the two halls. The pro-
posai also planned to expand
the eastern side of Haven Hall,
widen the halls around the Fish
Bowl and increase the space
shove the Fish Bowl, according
to an Oct. 25., 1999 article in
The Michigan Daily.
"We are going from a Fish
Bowl to an aquarium," archi-
tect Steve Einhorn said at the
regents meeting where the
renovations were approved,
according to the article.
The $38 million project,
according to the Daily article,
was slated to hegin in Septem-

her 2000 and was expected to
take three years to huild.
Einhorn Yaffee Prescott
Architecture & Engineering
P.C., the architects for the proj-
ect, said they wanted to pre-
serve the vihrant character of
the Fish Bowl hut also accom-
modate the renovation pians.
"The Fish Bowl is a major
crossroads and we want to
accommodate and encourage
it," EYP Executive Principle
Tom Birdsey said at the regents
meeting, according to the arti-
cle.
The architects said they
wanted to hlend their design
for Haven's eastern fagade with
the rest of the huildings sur-
rounding the Diag. They looked
at the older Harlan Hatcher
Graduate Lihrary and the
Kraus Natural Science Build-
ing for inspiration.

"We want to reflect upon
the past while we emhrace the
future," Einhorn said in the
article.
Regent Laurence Deitch (D-
Bingham Farms) told the Daily
at the time that the renovation
and expansion would he a wel-
comed addition.
"It is a very thought-
ful design and significantly
improves something central to
Central Campus," he said.
During the construction,
offices housing the Universi-
ty's American culture, history
and political science programs
were scheduled to move to
rented offices in the Frieze
Building, which was demol-
ished in 2007 to make space for
the construction of North Quad
Residence Hall.

NEWS BRIEFS
E EAST LANSING, Mich.
MSU to end retiree
health benefits for
newly hired staff
Michigan State University says
it will stop providing retiree health
care benefits to new faculty and
staff members but will honor cov-
erage for current employees.
University President Lou Anna
K. Simon announced the change
yesterday. She says it takes effect
July 1.
The university says the move is a
response to rising health care costs
and "constrained revenues." It says
Michigan State is the only Big Ten
university that still offers retiree
health benefits to new hires.
Simon says the university will
honor the health care provisions
of its collective bargaining agree-
ments.
WASHINGTON
obama says China
following through
on Iran penalties
President Barack Obama says
China is already following through
on what he says is a sincere consid-
eration of tough new sanctions on
Iran over its nuclear program.
China has sent representatives
to New York for discussions at the
United Nations aimed at imposing
new sanctions. That does not guar-
antee Chinese support for sanc-
tions, but Obama seemed pleased.
Obama says China is concerned
about the economic effects of
new sanctions since Iran is an oil
exporter and holds trade relation-
ships with nations around the
globe.
But Obama says words and
promises among nations have to
mean something, and he says the
world is growing more convinced
that Iran's nuclear program is out
of bounds.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland
Sick airline crew
cause emergency
landing in Iceland
An American Airlines flight
with 145 people on board made an
emergency landing in Iceland on
yesterday after five crew members
* became ill, apparently from chemi-
cal fumes in the cabin.
American Airlines Flight 49
traveling from Paris to Dallas-Fort
Worth landed safely at Keflavik
Airport just after 1345 GMT (9:45
a.m. EDT). Airport spokesman
Fridthor Eydal said mechanics and
civil aviation investigators were
examining the plane to find the
cause of the problem.
"They were apparently having
some sort of problems with some
sort of fumes in the cabin," said
spokesman Tim Smith of American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp.
Frodi Jonsson, an official at the
airport's fire department, said the
fumes might be traced to boxes in
the hold containing plane parts
with oils and liquids. He said the

cargo would be examined in an
investigation.
"There was nothing unusual
going on," he told the Icelandic
National Broadcaster when asked
whether he suspected a terrorist
attack.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
First Lady makes
surprise visit to
Haitian captial
First lady Michelle Obama
made a surprise visit yesterday to
the ruins of the Haitian capital, a
high-profile reminder that hun-
dreds of thousands remain in des-
perate straits three months after
the earthquake.
The first lady and Jill Biden,
wife of Vice President Joe Biden,
took a helicopter tour of Port-au-
Prince, where many people are
still homeless, before landing at
the destroyed national palace
to meet President Rene Preval.
They later talked with students
whose lives have been upended
by the disaster and walked along
a vast, squalid encampment of
families living under bed sheets
and tents.
"It's powerful," Obama told
reporters. "The devastation is
definitely powerful."
A number of past and present
world leaders have visited since
the earthquake, including for-
mer presidents Bill Clinton and
George W. Bush.

Daily wire reports

FIRESIDE CHAT
From Page 1A
students with disabilities requires
students who identify as disabled to
"step forward."
"If you come, you can get it,"
Harper said. "We need to figure out
how it occurs before because some-
times what happens is that students
don't want to put (their disability)on
their application material. There's
such a fear that there's going to be
negative consequences to it, so peo-
ple are silent. Then it makes it diffi-
cult to do the proactive piece."
LSA sophomore Sarah Rabinowe,
meanwhile, discussed the difficul-
ties students with learning disabili-
ties face if they want to apply for
classes that would serve as a sub-
stitute for the LSA foreign language
requirement.
All LSA students are required
to take four semesters of a foreign
language. However, if students
show documentation that they have
"extreme difficulty" learning a lan-

guage, and if students receive a score
on the Michigan Language Aptitude
Test that shows they have a lan-
guage learning disability, they may
petition the University's Academic
Standards Board for a language sub-
stitution.
In an e-mail interview after the
fireside chat, Rabinowe wrote that
there needs to be more involvement
from the University's Services for
Students with Disabilities office in
the process of obtaining a language
substitution.
"The issue is that there's a failure
model set up where there is a waiver
process that goes through the For-
eign Language Waiver Committee
(FLW), a subcommittee of the LSA
Academic Standards Board," she
wrote. "It's done through the advis-
ing department, rather than the
disability department and only one
person from the disability depart-
ment is on the committee."
She added that the Academic
Standards Board has requirements
that she says are impossible to meet.
Rabinowe said the board often ques-

tions the legitimacy of a student's
disability or says that the language
a student is taking is merely too dif-
ficult for he or she and that he or she
should try another one.
"You have to try, that's fair
enough, a foreign language before
you can apply for your waiver," she
said. "The problem is, they often
require that you try, withdraw, fail
(and) show you can't succeed in
more than one language."
By the time students complete the
process of obtaining a language sub-
stitution, their grade point average
and other academic standards have
suffered, Rabinowe said.
"By then you are no longer com-
petitive for certain graduate schools,
for many different programs, fel-
lowships and scholarships," she
said. "People lose their scholarships
over this issue."
Ideally, Rabinowe wrote, she'd
like the Academic Standards Board
to be more understanding of stu-
dents with disabilities.
"What I'd like to see happen is
that there would be the consider-

ation (for people with) these dis-
abilities," she wrote. "If they've had
these accommodations for years,
had a foreign language waiver
throughout their education, and/or
a preexisting medical documenta-
tion that says you have a disability,
that (should) be a proper indication
of your ability. Not to fail a language
at the University of Michigan. Evi-
dence of a disability should be proof
enough."
Coleman answered Rabinowe's
apprehensionsby saying the Univer-
sity is working hard to be a welcom-
ing place for all students.
"Often times with the silent dis-
abilitiesifyou'renotinawheelchair,
people say, 'Well, what do you really
need?' " Coleman said. "We've been
very active in trying to get mental
health issues to the fore and trying
to say, 'Look, this is a part of normal
issues that people have. We're not
going to discourage people because
of this."'
Another topic that came up was
the University's impending Smoke
Free Initiative - scheduled to take

effect in July 2011 - which has been
a topic of debate across campus that
students pointedly questioned Cole-
man about it at the fireside chat yes-
terday.
Students accused Coleman of
initiating the smoking ban without
transparency and without student
input. Coleman denied the charges
and defended the policy.
"I disagree with your premise
completely that we haven't been
transparent," Coleman responded
to the students who raised the
issue.
She said smokers and non-smok-
ers alike were consulted when the
decision was made to implement
the ban. She encouraged anyone
who wanted to get involved in the
process to speak with the task force
created to help initiate the smoking
ban.
"We've had lots of people
involved, and we want to find
ways to be sensitive (to people who
smoke)," Coleman said. "We're not
telling you, you can't smoke. We just
don't wantyou to smoke on campus."


MSA
From Page 1A
states that MSA should appoint a rep-
resentativeto the smokinginitiative's
Student Life Subcommittee in an
effort to gain more information about
the ban.
LSA junior Graham Kozak, the
president of the College Libertar-
ians, helped draft the resolution.
Kozak said at the meeting that he is
frustrated with University officials -
especially University President Mary
Sue Coleman - who he says did not
request enough student input before
deciding to implement the initiative.
In a press release and columns
in The Michigan Daily, members of
the College Libertarians have iden-
tified Coleman as having an appar-
ent conflict of interest due to her
position on the board of Johnson &
Johnson - a company that manu-
factures and markets smoking ces-
sation products.
Kozacksaid ifthe allegations prove
to be true, they could have large impli-
cations as Coleman is compensated
for sitting on the company's board.
He said the main reason for the
resolution and the accusation of Cole-
man's conflict of interest is that there
is not enough information provided to
campus about the origin of the Smoke
Free Initiative.
"We want to see what informa-
tion the University has gathered in
order to implement the plan and how
the students and faculty stand on the
issue," Kozaksaid.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in an interview yes-
terday thatColeman's position on the
board of the company doesn't consti-
tute a conflict of interest.
"We are absolutely confident that
there is no conflict of interest with
President Coleman with her service
onthe Johnson& Johnsonboard," he
said.
Fitzgerald added that the company
does not make the types of smoking
cessation products recommended by
the medical community.
"The medical community tells us
that the most effective medical inter-
ventionto help people stop smoking is
the prescription cessation product,"
he said. "Johnson & Johnson simply
does not make any prescription cessa-
tionproduct."
In addition, Fitzgerald explained
that the University has not yet deter-
minedif,whentheSmokeFreeInitia-
tive is implemented, it will subsidize
smokingcessation products or simply
negotiate a discounted rate.
Fitzgerald added that with imple-
mentation of the ban more than ayear
away, the University is still finalizing
the details.
"We're still more than a year away
from implementing this policy so
there are many details to be worked

outjustlikeallthesubcommittees are
stillatworkdeterminingthebestpos-
sible wayto implement this policy for
this campus," he said.
He continued: "Subcommittees
will report back by this fall ... leaving
plenty of time for people to under-
stand what that implementation plan
would be."
LSA senior Jonathan Slemrod,
former president of the College Liber-
tarians, said at the meeting last night
that the resolution is about transpar-
ency and obtaining information about
the ban.
"The resolution has nothing to do
with if you agree with the ban or not,"
he said.
He said very few students have
been involved in the process, add-
ing that the 1,500 students who were
contacted for input on the ban do not
accurately represent the 40,000 stu-
dents on campus.
Kozak said that he hopes that
through MSA, the administration
may recognize students' opinions
on the issue. He added that students
may benefit from tryingto maketheir
voices heard.
"Whether the University listens or
not, I think we as a student body have
something to gain," he said.
MSA PASSES RESOLUTION IN
SUPPORT OF LEO
At last night's meeting, MSA
unanimously passed a resolution to
establish solidarity with the Lectur-
ers' Employee Organization, which
is in the middle of negotiating a new
contract with the University.
LEO represents about 1,300 lec-
turers on the University's three cam-
puses - with 900 members on the
Ann Arbor campus, according to the
resolution.
Currently, the University is pro-
posing an increase in health care
premiums by 240 and 300 percent
for part time lecturers, which would
result ina large pay cut, according to
the resolution.
LSA Rep. John Oltean, an
author of the resolution, said
MSA is crucial in inspiring cam-
pus-wide support for University
lecturers.
"Lecturers make up 30 per-
cent of our college education
time," Oltean said in an interview
after the meeting. "We need to
look out for our lecturers so that
we can receive the quality educa-
tionthat we want."
RESOLUTION TO CREATE
GOVERNMENTS COUNCIL
A resolution was unanimously
passed at last night's Michigan
Student Assembly meeting to
create a Michigan Student Gov-
ernments' Council that would
promote a unified student voice

afross all University of Michigan
campuses.
This resolution, drafted by MSA
Rackham Rep. Michael Benson, is
intended to encourage discussion
between the Ann Arbor, Flint and
Dearborn studentgovernments.
"(The Student Governments'
Council is) nothing overly complicat-
ed,butsomethingwherebyindividual
student governments can reach out to
each other and have a collaborative
dialogue," Benson said.
The three student governments
are members of the Student Asso-
ciation of Michigan, which addresses
issues within the state.
One of the main purposes of the
Student Governments' Council is to
"encourage and facilitate open com-
munication" between the campuses,
according to the resolution.
Benson said in an interview before
last night's meeting that all the cam-
puses are onboard for more cohesion
and governance so thatthey can tack-
leissues together.
"To be able to speak as a single
council, it is now all the students at
the University of Michigan speaking
with a single voice on a single topic,"
Benson said.
Benson said all three campuses
need to have a mode for students to
address the University administra-
tion and Board of Regents.
Owen Agho, current student gov-
ernment president at the Univesity's
Flint campus, said at the meeting last
night that the resolution would ben-
efit all University students.
"We will have a place to come
together to talk about all different
issues thataffectall campuses,"Agho
said. "We need a place for all Michi-
gan students to come together and
work together in a practical manner."
Since MSA passed the resolution,
Agho said the Flint and Dearborn
campuses will now follow suit.

MEXICO
From Page 1A
versity's International Travel
Oversight Committee, said the
violence has risen to such a
level at the border that it is now
"extremely dangerous" to travel
in the area.
"We've read State Depart-
ment reports and spoke with
council officers in Mexico, and
on the basis of that review, we've
decided it is too dangerous for
students to go on University-
sponsored activities," Godfrey
said.
Much of the violence stems
from ongoing fights between
drug cartels that are vying to
control drug trafficking routes.
"This has been going on for a
number of years, but in recent
months the head of one car-
tel was killed in the fight and
another was arrested, and now
they're fighting for control of the
territory," Godfrey said.
According to Godfrey, the
areas are "unstable" and "unpre-
dictable" - citing large fires
in the middle of the day and an
instance where two mechanical
engineering graduate students
from the Technological Insti-
tute of Higher Learning of Mon-
terrey were shot to death during
crossfire between Mexican sol-
diers and drug gangs.
The State Department's travel
warning is effective until May
12. University students may still
travel to central and southern
Mexico for University programs.
However, undergraduates
must have their trip approved'
by their dean or an advisor and
must submit a consent form
signed by a legal guardian. Uni-
versity faculty members plan-
ning to lead a student trip in
central or southern Mexico must

also obtain approval from their
dean.
According to Godfrey, the
travel ban has caused two stu-
dent groups that were planning
to visit Mexico, in May and
June to make new trip arrange-
ments.
One was a bus trip that
planned to start its tour in
Mexico City and then contin-
ue into northern Mexico. The
other - a Global Intercultural
Experience for Undergraduates
group, which takes University
students on trips abroad - was
planning to visit both sides of
the Mexican border. The GEIU
group will now stay in Tuscan;
Az.
Godfrey said the travel ban
will continue indefinitely until
the situation improves.
"That's anyone's guess as to
how long that will be," Godfrey
said. "For the near term it looks
like it will remain unstable,
There is very little that is predi-
cable now."
Accordingtothe State Depart-
ment travel warning, more than
2,600 people were killed just in
Ciudad Juarez in 2009. Mexi-
can officials also report that
there were more than 16,000 car
thefts and 1,900 carjackings the
same year.
The University last issued a
travel ban to Mexico in April
2009 when the H1N1 virus first
surfaced. The University then
lifted the travel restrictions in
May, which Godfrey said was
because the virus moved into'
the United States.
As for the current travel ban,,
Godfrey said the University is'
going to keep an eye on the situ-
ation.
"We're going to watch it:
closely and when it resolves:
itself we'll lift the suspension,"
he said.

Costs of unpaid internships
Federal laws must be enforced to protect students
T he phrase 'paid internship' is becoming an oxymoron. And
over the last several years, the demise of the paid intern
has been accompanied by a huge growth in the number
of unpaid internships. But some of these internships offer little or
no educational experience to the students they employ. The trend
toward unpaid employment has caught the attention of state and
federal law enforcement officers, who cite strict federal guidelines
that employers must follow when hiring students without pay.
Federal and state government agencies must distinguish between
beneficial unpaid internships and those that exploit students and
enforce labor laws to protect students.

Aspirations of innovation

0

As reported on Apr. 2 by The New York
Times, investigations intp several exploit-
ative internships have been opened by state
officials and, more recently, by the U.S.
Department of Labor. The acting director
of the department's wage and hour division
has said that unpaid internships offered by
for-profit companies are legal in only a few
circumstances. Federal law requires that
unpaid work by trainees adhere to six cri-
teria. Companies can't derive immediate
benefit from the labor, the experience must
be similar to that of a vocational school and
the interns can't displace paid workers.
Granted, many unpaid internships offer
students valuable educational opportuni-
ties. They can also help students form con-
nections with employers that may lead to
permanent jobs. In today's competitive job
market, employers consider practical work
experience crucial. Many unpaid intern-
ships provide students with this experi-
ence. And unpaid internships can fill an
important hole on a student's resume by
familiarizing them with the inner work-
ings of an industry. Students shouldn't be
scared off by horror stories because many
internships can make a big difference when
searching for a job after graduation.
But some employers use students who
are desperate for work experience as free
labor. Some firms are known to take on
"interns" to perform menial tasks that don't

have educational value. The students find
themselves in the same office as profession-
als in their career field, but they are still far
from an educational experience because
they aren't really involved. And students
in particularly competitive industries may
feel they have no choice but to remain in a
useless unpaid job simply to have the cre-
dential on their resum. These situations
warrant government intervention to pro-
tect students.
But the most troubling problem with
the growth of unpaid internships is the
effect they have on the students who can't
afford them. Many students' finances don't
allow them to spend the summer without
income, and they are unable pay for the
travel or housing expenses associated with
an internship. But because internships are
important to prospective employers, the
inability of low-income students to accept
unpaid internships could put them at a seri-
ous disadvantage when they look for jobs.
Employers should appropriately compen-
sate students to incentivize a diverse group
of students to take internships and help
level the playing field.
Students are valuable members of society
and when their work contributes to the wel-
fare of a firm, they deserve fair compensa-
tion. They should speak up when they feel
they're being exploited. And when they do,
the government needs to protect them.

woke up at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday.
And, as crazy as that sounds, I
wasn't the only one. To be more
specific, over 300
people from Ann
Arbor and across
the country woke
up early enough to ,
see the sun rise.
And it was all
in the spirit of a
somewhat abstract
goal: to share ideas
and inspire one TOMMASO
another. We were PAVONE
all going to attend
the 2010 TEDx-_
UofM conference.
On that morning, I thought back to
a conversation I had five months ago.
It was then that my good friend Alex
O'Dell first pitched his idea to hold
a TEDx conference. I was skeptical
at best. To start, TEDx events are as
ambitious as they are unstructured.
At the core, they are self-organized
conferences focused on promoting
"ideas worth spreading." This didn't
give Alex much to work with. And
while I didn't question Alex's creativ-
ity and vision, I doubted his ability to
turn such grandiose goals into reality.
And so it was that five months later on
Saturday morning, I was awoken by
my alarm clock with only one thought
in my mind: I was wrong.
TEDxUofM, which was located in
the Biomedical Research Building,
was a celebration of ideas and visions.
It featured a diverse set of curious
individuals being brought together
by their shared interest in innovation.
600 applied to attend and approxi-
mately half were selected. Unsurpris-
ingly, these selectees were giddy and
energetic (sometimes troublingly so,
given that it was a Saturday morning).
The atmosphere was electric.
I was grumpier than most. I had no
caffeine in my system and was ner-

vous about botching the TED talk I
was scheduled to present later that
morning. But mostof all, I sawsuccess
everywhere around me: the sold-out
auditorium, the flawless design of the
conference programs and the hun-
dreds of red Xs lining the windows of
the Biomedical Research Building. It
was a reminder of how my skepticism
had condemned me to think small,
whereas Alex's aspirations had pushed
him to think big, take a risk, and reap
the rewards.
As the conference proceeded (and
I, thankfully, did not botch my TED
talk), I began to finally experience
the TED spirit. People around me
were laughing, crying, scratching
their heads and interacting with one
another as our brains and hearts were
subjected to a stimulated workout. But
what really lifted my spirits was how
proud I was of Alex.
You have to realize that for many
months I barely got to see him. While
his friends partied on weekends, Alex
secluded himself to libraries and class-
rooms, planning the conference with
likeminded hermits. During phone
conversations, Alex increasingly only
talked about the project. He seemed
preoccupied, distracted - even pos-
sessed - by his lofty goal. I began to
wonder whether it would all be worth
it. This made witnessing the validation
of Alex's efforts all the more inspiring.
If there is one lesson I learned from
Alex and TEDxUofM, it's that think-
ing big does pay off. Where I saw
obstacles and risk, Alex saw opportu-
nity and success. But vision was not
the only variable which was key to
Alex's success; it was also sweat - and
lots of it. Consider the followingexam-
ple. A month or two ago, I was awoken
by a 2 a.m. phone call on a Sunday from
Alex asking meto tell him more about
my proposed talk for the conference.
I was about to complain about the
timing of the phone call when I real-

ized that, for the entire weekend, the 0
TEDxUofM team had spent dozens
of hours, sometimes without sleep,
reviewing speaker applications. It was
2 a.m. on a Sunday in the middle of the
school year, and yet there they were,
slavingto realize their vision.
TEDxUofM was
an example of one
student's drive.
Here at Michigan, we hear con-
stantly that our creativity is prized,
that student initiative is encouraged
and that our aspirations will find sup-
port in the administration. Like many,
I didn't think much of these state-
ments - until Saturday. Because while
the dedication of the TEDxUofM
team was central to the realization of
the conference, the group benefitted
from various University institutions
that invested thousands of dollars in
the TEDxUofM project. This allowed
Alex and his team to implement a suc-
cessful marketing campaign, heighten
everybody's expectations and hit a
home run. It was the epitome of a suc-
cessful partnership that turned vision
ipto reality.
As spring brings forth warmer tem-
peratures and new beginnings, I urge
you to revisityour aspirations. The suc-
cess of TEDxUofM is a testament to a
student's ability to realize his goals,
even when the odds seemed stacked
against him. And if Alex could do it
during the cold, morose days of win-
ter, you can certainly do it during the
warm, sunny days of summer.

On Thursday, I returned to my room after a
busy afternoon of classes and unloaded my book
bag. My attention focused on one of my three
roommates, Rachel, who sat on the floor with a
look of disgust. After asking her what was wrong,
she replied, "I justbought this new Garnier Fruc-
tis shampoo and conditioner and Clean and Clear
face wash, but I found out these companies test
on animals! Should I throw them away?" Her
question sparked my curiosity. I thought back to
my own products: Pantene shampoo, Neutrogena
facial cream cleanser, Crest toothpaste, Lanc6me
facial cream, etc. I ran to my laptop to research
the brands for which I had once thought myself
a loyal consumer.
Shockingly, I discovered that many of the
products I purchase are smaller companies
under the major umbrella company of Procter &
Gamble - a big player in animal testing, accord-
ing to the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. Even the Tide I used for my laundry
detergent tested their products on animals.
Instead of seething, I focused my attention on
researching and educating myself about animal
testing through a PETA website and finding
alternative products to use that didn't participate
in animal testing. As an avid Burt's Bees custom-
er, I will admit I had a little moment of joy to see
that they didn't test on animals.
Fortunately, the list of companies that didn't
test on animals vastly outnumbered the amount
of companies that did test on animals. I found
affordable alternatives with Revlon, Kiss my
Face, Paul Mitchell, Aveda and Nature's Best.
Through a little investigation, I've learned
that you can't go on face value. A lot of companies
claim to be humane and green but don't follow
the appropriate procedures. For example, natu-
ral-looking containers can be alluring and look
legitimate to consumers. But many companies
will advertise the fact that a particular product
(face wash, shampoo, etc.) is not animal tested
while other products of the same line are. Labels
are designed to convey a positive image, not pub-
licize a company's practices.
Legally, the 1966 Animal Welfare Act requires
the "humane care, handling, treatment and trans-
portation of some animals in certain situations,"
according to the animal rights group In Defense
of Animals. However effective the act may have

been, the success rate is undermined by the act's
exclusion of cold-blooded animals and failure to
protectany animal usedfor experimental means.
According to the IDA, "the Animal Welfare Act
does not protect animals during an experiment,
regardless of how painful or even unnecessary
it is." Poor enforcement of the act's regulations
in recent years demands scrutiny. Recently, all
types of media have highlighted those who shirk
the standards of the act, including a spotlight on
our own beloved University Health System.
According to a February 2009 article in the
Daily, the University has come under pressure
from the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine for alleged violations of the Animal
Welfare Act ('U' under pressure for dog testing,
01/14/2009). The accusations and a formal com-
plaint by the USDA proved true. A professor of
surgery from the University Medical School had
been using live dogs during life-saving surgery
simulations and procedural practice. The dogs
underwent surgeries by the training students
and were euthanized shortly afterward. The pro-
fessor, Dr. Richard Burney, claimed that his prac-
tices hadbeen approvedby the American College
of Surgeons.
Though the experimental use of animals isn't
illegal, it isn't necessary. Our University suppos-
edly holds itself to high standards in ethical mat-
ters, but the University shouldn't ignore ethics
pertaining to animal rights. There was no reason
alternative methods weren't employed for the
same goal all along, especially since the Univer-
sity has been financially-capable of using other
methods, like the TraumaMan System, a replica
human body capable of undergoing realistic sur-
gical procedures for teaching purposes that the
University now uses.
When dealing with strategic company adver-
tisements, it's important that they are looked
at with skepticism. In order to make informed
decisions, do a little research yourself and see
what kind of practices you are really supporting
through your purchases and if it aligns with your
own values. As innocent as you may think pur-
chasing your next bottle of shampoo or laundry
detergent is, knowing that a living being suffered
for your purchase may change your mind.

Back to (summer) school

'm swamped. I have four papers,
each more than six pages, due in
the next week-and-a-half and a
final the week after
that. But what
keeps me going
through the con-
stant pressure and
sleep deprivation
is the thought of
summer break just ,
around the corner.
I can almost taste _
it. As I type fran- RACHEL
tically away at my VAN GILDER
laptop, I console
myself by conjur-
ing up visions of
my summer plans in my mind. I'm
finally going to finish "Robinson
Crusoe," buy a new bathing suit so I
can lounge by the pool to get a foxy
tan and visit my older sister in Flor-
ida. It's going to be a sweet, relaxing
summer straight out of an F. Scott
Fitzgerald novel.
Oh, yeah. And I'm going to take a
class this summer here at the Uni-
versity. I'm actually kind of psyched
about it.
Yes, I know I was just complaining
about school - it's my prerogative as a
(very busy) college student, just like it's
yours. Yes, I know that taking classes
during the summer is a total drag for
most people. But learning is my pas-
sion. And I think that summer classes
are actually better than classes during
the regular year in some ways.
The University offers three terms
during the time that most students
are away. There's spring term, which
will last from May 3to June 25 for the
College of Literature, Science and the
Arts this year. Then there's summer
term from June 29 to Aug. 20, and
finally spring/summer term, which
stretches across the spring and sum-
mer terms. That gives students a lot
of scheduling options.

There are also a fair amount of
classes available. The College of LSA
expanded the amount and type of
classes it offers over spring and sum-
mer semesters last year in response
to increased demand from students.
Between 2007 and 2009, the number
of students enrolling for a full sched-
ule during spring and summer terms
increased by 9 percent, according to
a June 15 report by The Ann Arbor
News. According to the article, many
students are taking more summer
classes in order to fulfill require-
ments for double majors or to com-
pensate for studying abroad.
I'm taking a class this summer
so that I'll be able to finish up all of
my major and certification minor
requirements by the end of the fall
2010 semester so that I can spend
winter 2011 student teaching. And
this isn't my first time. Last year, I
took six credits during spring term
and four during summer term. This
year, I'm taking a measly three cred-
its during summer term. And I'm
looking forward to it.
That's because I think that sum-
mer courses can give students some
opportunities that they don't get dur-
ing the regular school year. For one,
most students have a lighter work-
load. And summer classes have a less
intense atmosphere that takes off
some of the pressure. These factors
allow students to learn without feel-
ing like the stakes are so high.
And class sizes are smaller by
default, which makes access to the
professor easier. My experience last
summer taught me that this can be
great. I took two two-credit courses
with my favorite teacher here at the
University, Professor Douglas Trevor,
an associate professor of early modern
literature in the English Department.
I'd already taken classes taught by
him twice during the regular school
year, but they'd been lectures. I pretty

much love this guy, so the opportunity
to interact with him in a much smaller,
more personal setting was enlighten-
ing. I learned a ton about the incred-
ibly dense and pedantic John Milton
(the poet who wrote "Paradise Lost",
for you non-English majors) - way
more than I think I would have in a
large lecture.
I can't wait to tan
poolside with my #
history textbook.
Granted, spring and summer class-
es can also be intensive. Many con-
dense a four-credit course usually
taught in 14 weeks into 7 weeks. That
means longer class periods and much
more information to be absorbed in a
short amount of time. I took History
240, the World Since 1492 (which,
you may recall, is the year Columbus
sailed the ocean blue), last spring.
Class was three hours long, and there
was one day that we covered 150
years in three countries in a single
class period. By the end, my brain
was numb.
But for the most part, I think the
good outweighs the bad. The laid-back
atmosphere of classes and the chance
to interact more closely with profes-
sors make classes a great way for a
nerd like me to spend the summer.
So this summer as I'm lounging by
the pool in my cute new suit, I'll be
reading the text for the history class
in which I'm enrolled. But only after
I get "Crusoe" out of the way.

Diagnosis: Rock

COURTESY OF 20TH CENTURY FOX
Now they have to watch this movie for seven years straight.
Can't save the 'Date'

By ALEX BILES
DailyArts Writer
A group of five musicians hail-
ing from the streets of West Phila-
delphia with a name evoking two
notorious hip-
hop icons - it Dr. Dog
wouldn't be hard
for an outsider to Tomorrow at
mistake Dr. Dog 8:30 p.m.
for a hardcore Blind Pig
rap group. And Tickets from $15
although Dr. Dog
laughs off such foolishness, make
no mistake about the band and its
recently released album, Shame,
Shame. These guys are for real.
Dr. Dog will bring its upbeat,
smile-inducing and psychedelia-
laced brand of retro-influenced
rock to Ann Arbor when its live
show hits the Blind Pig this
week. The Michigan Daily got the
opportunity to chat with Dr. Dog
co-founder, songwriter and lead
guitarist Scott McMicken about
the new record, changes within
the band and its last experience
in Ann Arhor hefore they take the
Blind Pig stage Thursday night.
Formed in 1999, the band's
first break came in 2004, when
McMicken and co-founder Toby
Leaman attended a My Morn-
ing Jacket concert and handed
frontman Jim James a demo tape.
Impressed, James took Dr. Dog
on My Morning Jacket's next tour
and the rest was history. Since
then, the band has steadily built
a devoted following opening for
The Black Keys, The Strokes, The
Raconteurs and others, as well as
playing music festivals like Bonn-
aroo and Lollapalooza.

Steve Carell and
Tina Fey are out of
their comfort zones
in dull new comedy
By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Editor
A date gone wrong is hard to
watch - just painful, really. You
expect your
date, at the
very least, to
be funny and Date Night
at least a bit
charming. An At Quality 16
evening of all- and Showcase
out thrills isn't 20th Century Fox
required. All
that's really
needed is some spark, something,
anything, to keep things interesting.
Dial down expectations for your
date as far as they will go: At the
very, very least, your date shouldn't
make you fall asleep.
How about a date with comedy
superstars Steve Carell and Tina
Fey? TV's Michael Scott and Liz
Lemon, together onscreen for 90
minutes, and the only thing they're
expected to do is be themselves -
be funny. They'd actually have to
try if they wanted to fail at that.
Which makes it difficult to
explain why a movie called "Date
Night," consisting solely of the two
of them playing Phil and Claire
Foster, a married couple running
around New York City and getting
into wacky shenanigans, isn't as
funny as it sounds. "Date Night" is

dull, plain and simple. It just drags
along, slower than any other high-
profile comedy in recent memory,
and it ruins the date nights of any
couples that happen to be in the
audience.
Perhaps director Shawn "The
Pink Panther" Levy is the one who
killed the funny. He does, after all,
have some notoriety in Hollywood
for his overly sanitized, bland big-
budget comedies - although the
first "Night at the Museum" was
plenty entertaining.
Or maybe writer Josh Klausner
simply doesn't know how to craft
an engaging script. His only other
significant credit is "Shrek the
Third," which he shares with over a
dozen other names. And really, the
story here had some.great potential:
There are shades of Hitchcock's
lighter, "North by Northwest" side
in the tale of a couple who inadver-
tently become caught up in crimi-
nal activity after taking someone
else's dinner reservation. It would
be easy to simply chalk the failure
of "Date Night" up to Klausner's
inability to find anything interest-
ing for his characters to do once the
concept has been established.
This overlooks the real problem
of the film, though, and that prob-
lem is Carell and Fey themselves. As
silly as it may sound, the two actors
are way outside their comfort zones
playing ordinary, upper-middle-
class suburban parents. The two of
them are (usually) rip-snortingly
hilarious when they're on TV play-
ing exaggerated character types.
On the big screen, as characters
with no over-the-top quirks and
no crazy ambitions, they can't pull

it off.
Take Carell. He's funny on "The
Office" because he's playing a gro-
tesque parody of a working-class
suburbanite. Michael Scott's day-
to-day workplace interactions
don't have any ground in reality,
and they're not meant to. In "Date
Night," he's severely toned back, to
the point where he's just an aver-
age schlub who occasionally blurts
out embarrassing things. In other
words, they took a deliberately sub-
versive sitcom character and made
him into a run-of-the-mill sitcom
character.
Fey, sadly, fares even worse, and
it's because her inseparable "30
Rock" job is completely at oddswith
her character here. After spending
four years playing a perpetually
lonely, career-driven woman who
wants childrenmore thananything,
suddenly she has bland, obnoxious
kids and becomes frustrated and
spiteful toward them in the firstfive
minutes of the film. The rest of the
time she's too grounded in reality
to make good use of the absurdist
shtick she does so well; there are
no Mexican Cheetos obsessions for
Fey's character here.
The jokes that do appear get
rammed into the ground. Carell
and Fey bicker about their mar-
riage at the most inopportune
moments. Mark Wahlberg never
puts on a shirt. And everyone in
New York is deeply appalled at the
idea of taking another couple's din-
ner reservation.
It's a bad sign when your date
keeps telling the same sort-of-fun-
ny anecdote over and over. There's
no future in that relationship.

An album of Filipino 'Love'

By JASMINE ZHU
Daily Arts Writer
Here Lies Love's ° cover art is
a pretty accurate summation
of the album itself. The cover
shows a soft-focused, flatter-

tion of a demure

decline - and yet, still maintains
an optimistic air. The album is pro-
vocatively feminine, with a care-
free, life-affirming girlish sauciness
about it. The presence of the Steel
Butterfly, as Marcos was called, is
definitely palpable on the album.
Here Lies Love is heavily steeped
in nostalgia, but its origins aren't
exactly easy to pinpoint. Ele-
ments of the tracks seem deliber-
ately anachronistic. In "American
Troglodyte," David Byrne and Fat-
boy Slim vocalize their projected
image of Marcos's dissatisfaction
with American modernity through
disparaging new practices: "Amer-
icans are surfing the internet /
Americans are listening to 50
Cent," to a backdrop of maracas
and '80s-inspired synths.
The 22-track album is shaped
by a bevy of established, mostly
female artists that represent the
different flavors of their respec-
tive generations as well as female
empowerment. Cyndi Lauper, an
'80s superstar, is paired against
'90s diva Tori Amos. Newer,
buzzed-about female singers in
the era of the blogosphere such
as St. Vincent and Santigold also
make appearances on the album.
("Nixon! Castro!" Santigold sings,
somewhat comically, on the track
"Please Don't.") Despite the span of
different generations of music, all

singers become puzzlingly homog-
enized in Here Lies Love to the
point where they are almost indis-
tinguishable from each other. This
lends the album a claustrophobic
air that makes the 90-minute play-
time seem a little bit burdened or
tired, despite the general playful-
ness of the album's contributors.
Byrne and Slim's Here Lies Love
collaboration is certainly admi-
rable, at the very least. The album
is clearly a product of labored love
(it's reportedly five years in the
making) and painstaking crafts-
manship. The technical skill of the
duo is undeniable. That isn't to say
the album isn't fun. Byrne's odd-
Byrne and Slim
get nostalgic.
ballness pushes the album above
the standard idyllic, romanticized
songs, of which the album admit-
tedly consists.
But while the songs are gener-
ally enjoyable and fun, the album
lacks the moxie and motivation
Marcos most assuredly possessed.
Consequently, Bryne and Slim's
concept album appears to have lost
some of its intended luster.

From Page 1A
declined to comment on the status of
the West Virginia investigation.
"We actually have a policy where
we can't comment on a current or
pending investigation," she said.
"The school may choose to do so but
we are not allowed to."
Members of the media were not
permitted to question Rodriguez
about the news of the NCAA inves-
tigation at West Virginia during his
press conference on yesterday.
The following advisory has been
distributed before each media ses-
sionthis spring:
"Rodriguez, staff and players are
unable to comment on the ongoing
NCAA process untilit has been com-
pleted. Please do not ask questions
or they will not be answered and we
will move onto the next question.
This will be in effect throughout the
spring and into the fall."
At the press conference Rodri-
guez said he's been able to put aside
off-field distractions and focus on
football.
"It's just been focusing on what
we come here to do," he said. "I
think our players and our staff have
really done a good job of staying
focused on the things we need to do
to take this program where we need
to take it.
"If I ask that of our staff, and I ask
that of our players, I certainly have
to do that myself"
University Athletic Director
David Brandon reaffirmed that

more mature Forcier

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez was reported to be under investigation at WVU.

Rodriguez would continue to be the
Michigan football coach in a release
distributed yesterday.
"There is nothing new that would
cause me to change my position," he
said in the release. "Rich will coach
our team this fall."
When University officials
announced they had received the
notice of allegations, Brandon said
Rodriguez would stay on, regardless
of the charges.
"Rich Rodriguez is our football
coach," Brandon said at the Feb. 23
press conference.
In yesterday's release, Brandon
directed all questions relating to the
investigation to the NCAA.
"There is no new NCAA inves-
tigation involving The University
of Michigan," Brandon said in the
release "Any question regarding an

NCAA query should be directed to
the NCAA."
As the head coach of the Moun-
taineers, Rodriguez compiled a
60-26 record and led West Virginia
to two BCS bowl games. He left fol-
lowing the 2007 season - and before
the team's Fiesta Bowl appearance
- to replace Lloyd Carr as the head
coach at Michigan.
Rodriguez's departure from the
Mountaineers was controversial, to
say the least, as West Virginia Uni-
versity sued him for a $4 million
buyout. The lawsuit was eventually
settled in the summer of2008, when
Michigan agreed to pay $2.5 million,
and Rodriguez the remaining $1.5
million.

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
has said repeatedly that he sees the
most growth in his players between
their first and second years.
For one player in particular,
there's a giant spotlight tracking
that first-to-second-year growth
period - and everybody's watch-
ing.
Tate Forcier, who started every
game last season at quarterback for
the Wolverines, has found himself
in the middle of a quarterback race
this spring - something that not
many expected heading into his
second year with the program.
But thanks to an improved
Denard Robinson and electrify-
ing early-enrollee Devin Gardner,
Forcier has some competition at the
position. And the Michigan coach-
ing staff is making sure Forcier is
aware that he can't be complacent.
"Tate knows he can't be average
and expect to be the starting quar-
terback," Rodriguez said on Tues-
day's Big Ten teleconference. "He
has to get better. Some of that is
maturity on the field, and some of it
is off the field, as well. I think Tate
is starting to get that. Competition
is helping him in that regard, both
with Denard Robinson and Devin
Gardner."
Maturity seems to be a buzz-
word around the Michigan football
program this spring, and not just
with Forcier. Rodriguez has spo-
ken at length about the develop-
ment of his freshmen and redshirt
freshmen heading into the upcom-
ing season.
"That's a natural process for our
younger guys," Rodriguez told the
media Tuesday afternoon. "We
expect them to grow not only ath-
letically, but certainly academical-
ly and socially as well during their
time here. It takes some guys lon-
ger to do that than others."
The coaching staff has met with

Michigan sophomore Tate Forcier is competing for the starting position at quarter-
back with sophomore Denard Rohinson during spring practice.

Duo of runners from New
Zealand the future for Blue

Forcier aboutthoseareasofgrowth
and what they expect to see out of
him in his sophomore season.
"We've had a lot of talks with
Tate about the expectations of
what we have for him - the same
that his family has for him, and I'm
sure he has for himself," Rodriguez
said. "It's sometimes a painful pro-
cess for young people to go through
and a painful process for coaches,
because you want it all right now,
the same as a parent would. You
get disappointed as parents do
when your children don't do all the
things that you want them to do."
On the field, Forcier knows
exactly what's expected of him: to
run the offense, and run it smooth-
ly. With 12 starts and nearly two
full spring seasons under his belt,'
Forcier has a great deal more
game experience than Robinson
and Gardner combined. But that
doesn't mean the two aren't capa-
ble of jaw-dropping plays in prac-
tice or in scrimmage - plays that
might make Forcier sweat a little
bit.
Rodriguez has said that Gardner
has "a great future" at Michigan,
and that he has a chance to play
this fall. Robinson, known mostly
for his foot speed last season, has

been impressing Rodriguez, too,
with his increased knowledge of
the passing game.
"I think last year he was kind of
just learning what we were doing
and just hoping to get that play
right," Rodriguez said. "Now, he's
getting to the point where he's
understanding why we're running
a certain play and how people are
going to defend it. He's still a ways
away from being really, really com-
fortable with everything we're
doing, but that's to be expected."
When asked Tuesday about how
many quarterbacks he feels he can
win football games with this fall,
Rodriguez said he was confident in
two - Forcier and Robinson.
"We have two for sure," Rodri-
guez said. "Devin is showing more
and more each time he practices.
Last Saturday (in the team scrim-
mage) was the best all three col-
lectively looked as a group, and the
best Devin has had. He's slowly
getting there."
Rodriguez said he won't have
a definitive order for his quar-
terbacks until the end of camp,
and maybe not even then. But for
Forcier to retain the starting job,
it seems it's all about showing his
maturity, on and off the field.

For the Daily
Seven thousand, eight hun-
dred and ten miles. That's 62,844
indoor tracks straightened out and
stacked next to each other. And
that's how far two of Michigan's
newest track and field stars have
traveled to compete for the Wol-
verines.
Freshman distance runners
Brendon Blacklaws and Dallas
Bowden have come all the way
from New Zealand to give the
Michigan men's track and field
team some thunder from down
under.
Blacklaws hails from Welling-
ton, the world's southernmost
capital city, located on the south-
ern tip of the North Island of New
Zealand. He graduated from Wel-
lington College (a New Zealand
secondary school) in 2007 and
captured New Zealand U-19 titles
in the 1,500m and 3,OOOm last year
while being recruited by Michigan.
Bowden, meanwhile, comes
from the small urban settlement
of Hastings, in the Hawke's Bay
Region of the North Island of New
Zealand. Bowden graduated from
Nelson College (also a secondary
school) in 2007 where he was the
New Zealand U-16 cross country
champion in 2006. He also holds
several U-16 records in the 800m
and 1,500m.

So what made these two runners
from the Southern Hemisphere
migrate north to Ann Arbor?
Bowden said former Wolverine
runner and fellow New Zealander
Nick Willis was a big influence on
his decision to come to Ann Arbor.
For Blacklaws, having a fellow
New Zealander recruit helped.
"With Dallas coming here as
well, it made things a lot easier,"
Blacklaws said. "-
He also credited Michigan asso-
ciate coach Ron Warhurst.
"I really like the way Ron oper-
ates - he's had success in the past
and it really helped out," Blacklaws
said.
Since arriving in the U.S., both
runners have faced challenges they
never had to face in New Zealand.
"The competition here, the
depth, is a lot bigger," Blacklaws
said. "You get into a race and
there's 20 guys running your pace
rather than two."
"First of all, we don't have
indoor competitions, that's com-
pletely new," Bowden said. "We
don't have a single indoor track in
the country."
When it comes to competing
indoors, he's still learning the
ropes.
"The racing is a lot harder, this
year has been a real learning curve
for me," Bowden said.
The changes to which these
runners have had to adjust to aren't

limited just to competitions, as
moving halfway around the globe
is bound to make a person home-
sick.
Neither runner's family has
seen them compete since they've
been at Michigan, but both say that
should change in the next year and
a half.
On the bright side, the transition
from living in New Zealand to liv-
ing in Ann Arbor has gone a little
smoother every day.
"I'm getting there, it's not a huge
culture shock or anything like
that," Bowden said. "It's just the
little things I've got to get used to."
Both runners do have a few
complaints, though.
Blacklaws said he misses all of
the fresh foods that were available
at home. 1owden isn't a fan of the
weather in Michigan.
"It doesn't snow where I'm
from, even in winter it's still pretty
warm," Bowden said. "I miss the
weather the most."
The ultimate goal remains the
same for both - competing in the
Olympics. Bowden knows he is
in the right place to accomplish
his goal as Warhurst has coached
twelve Olympians including
bronze medalists Willis and Brian
Diemer.
"Ron's had a lot of success with
runners in the past here, just keep
training and we'll see how it goes,"
Bowden said.

"We've just been increasing our

make sure that we don't have any
mental lapses, and make sure that
we are in top physical condition,"
DeRubeis said.
Practices are usually separated
into track workouts and on-field
workouts. The track workouts are
more focused on conditioning and
targeting specific muscle groups
that the players utilize, whereas
the on-field workouts consist of
scrimmages and drills for in-game
scenarios.
For the team, these extra prac-
tices will be necessary, as they are
currently in what they consider to
be a rebuilding year. Although the
program has around 50 people, just
about half of them are considered
active starters on the roster. Those
starters are much younger than
in previous years, but it definitely
doesn't mean they are lacking in
skill.
"This year, we are a younger
bunch," DeRubeis said. "We got a
lot of fire. We're really going to go
and give it our hardest, we're going
to give it our all, and it should be a
good postseason for us."

In the bottom of the first inning, fresh-
man centerfielder Patrick Biondi halted
in the middle of the
base path, anxiously TOLEDO 4

that junior leftfield-
er Ryan LaMarre had just launched deep
to right.
After a few seconds of indecision,
Biondi slowly turned and began the jog to
home. LaMarre had just hit his first home
run of the season, and Michigan took the
first lead of the game 2-0.
And the Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 19-11
overall) would never lose that lead, rolling
to an 8-4 victory over Toledo on Tuesday
afternoon.
Michigan capitalized on the wind blow-
ing out to right field, hitting three long
balls on the afternoon. After LaMarre's
round-tripper, senior catcher Chris Berset
added one of his own off the black exten-
sion in center.
It was the Wolverines' first back-to-
back jacks since LaMarre and then-junior
first baseman Mike Dufek accomplished
the feat Feb.20 of lastseason against Jack-
sonville State. Sophomore third baseman
John Lorenz added a solo shot of his own
in the second inning of yesterday's game.
Berset added another RBI on a sacrifice
fly in the seventh to finish with two on

the day. He said he was thrilled to match
LaMarre, as he had to keep step in their
friendly rivalry.
"There's always that (trash) talk,
because he cane back and he missed all
these games and he comes in and takes
my 'three' spot," Berset said. "I wasn't too
happy about that. He had to make up for it,
but he sure enough did. He's playing great
right now."
While the Wolverines held a 5-2 lead
going into the fourth, the Rockets (8-1
MAC, 21-10 overall) made things inter-
esting. Toledo scored two runs in the top
of the frame to chase Michigan's starting
pitcher, junior right-hander Matt Miller,
off the mound after just 3.1 innings.
But senior left-hander Eric Katzman
relieved Miller and proved more than
ready to answer the call.
The Harrington Park, N.J. native was
coming off his worst appearance of the
year when he started at Indiana April 4,
lasting just 0.2 innings before getting the
hook. He rebounded Tuesday, tossing five
hitless innings and shutting down the
Rockets' potent offense into the ninth.
"They got a lot of left-handed hitters
and my thing, my M.O., is that I'm good
against left-handed hitters," Katzman
said. "That's why I went in there. Coach
(Rich Maloney) told me before the game
you're the first one in. I just mixed it up
and changed speeds and was able to go."
And Maloney was pleased with his

southpaw's performance.
"Very encouraging," Maloney said. "We
need some guys to step up. We had (sopho-
more right-hander Brandon) Sinnery on
Sunday, and Katzman today, and hope-
fully we can keep (getting) some different
guys. That's what you need to have."
Toledo came in hot, riding an eight-
game winning streak and not having lost
since a tough 4-3 result against Ohio State
on March 3L
The Rockets also had a better record
and a better RPI than the Wolverines (80
to 82), meaning they potentially could
have been considered the favorite to win
the contest.
But Michigan - winners of 13 of its last
15 games - had also played well recent-
ly, and certainly didn't appear to be the
underdog in its decisive victory.
"Great win," Berset said. "Great pitch-
ing and everything, great defense, great
win. We came out and swung the bats and
we needed to. Toledo's a good team. It was
a great win."
BIONDI MAKES IT: With 19 stolen
bases, Biondi came in tied for thefreshman
single-season record mark with Bruce Fox,
who reached that number in 1955.
With his swipe of second base in the
first inning, Biondi broke the mark to take
sole possession of first place. He added
another steal the next inning to give him
21 for the year, breaking the tie for 10th-
place all time in a single season.

Sweeping conference opponents and
earning Big Ten weekly awards has become
a recent standard for the No. 2 Michigan
softball team.
But junior pitcher Jordan Taylor - who
pitched a five-inning perfect game this Sat-
urday against Minnesota - refuses to allow
the Wolverines or herself to become com-
placent.
"In these type of games, a lot of teams
have a tendency to expect things to happen
and expect everyone else to do it," Taylor
said through the Athletic Department, after
her perfect game.
"It can be a struggle to stay focused.
Pitchers can get a little lazy when they think
the hitters aren't as good. For me, it helps to
make little individual goals. I made a deal
with my mom at the beginning of the season
that if I threw a perfect game, she would get
me a little gift; I actually just upped the ante
(Saturday), so that was good timing."
In addition to the gift from her mom,
Taylor's weekend performance earned her
another prize - her fourth Big Ten Pitcher
of the Week title this season. The junior has
started 19 games for Michigan this season,
throwing 15 complete games in that span
and keeping her cool on the mound along
the way.
"Your pitcher sets the tone for the
defense," Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
said. "(Taylor) is going to be in command of
the game, get ahead of hitters and put them
away - a strikeout is great defense. But I
think the pitcher can give the team a lot of
confidence, and I know our kids are confi-
dent in (Taylor)."
The Wolverines gave Taylor plenty of
run support en route to her perfect game, as
Michigan cruised to a 9-0 victory over the
Golden Gophers. Saturday's game was the
fifth time a Wolverine pitcher tossed a per-
fect game, and Taylor sealed herself a spot
in the record books with her fifth career no-
hitter.
Taylor has shown great poise from the
mound this season and has earned a 16-2
record.
Leading the Big Ten with 190 strikeouts
in 125.1 innings pitched, the junior was
named one of 25 finalists for the 2010 USA
Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award
this past week. With two no-hitters under
her belt already this season - the first com-
ing against Oklahoma State on Feb. 19 -
Taylor boasts a dominant 1.17 ERA.
"(Taylor) makes defense a lot easier for
us," senior captain Maggie Viefhaus said.
"When she makes a mistake, it's an aggres-
sive mistake. It's so great playing behind the
pitchers we have."
The junior had a target on her back enter-

ing this season, as her coaches and team-
mates expected the righty to build upon
her strong performances last season. After
posting a 1.40 ERA and 19 wins in 2009,
Taylor has continued her dominance on the
mound in 2010.
In the game against then-No. 8 UCLA
in February - a 13-inning, 4-2 victory for
Michigan - Taylor flashed some of her best
stuff. Striking out 18 hitters, the hurler's
13-inning effort was a career-high.
"Hutch had really been instructing us to
stay one-pitch focused," Taylor said after
the first series of the season against UCLA.
"But that's always a little easier said than
done. For the first time ever, I felt likeI was
able to focus on one pitch at a time and not
worry about the outcome.
"I was more focused on my pitches and
them working then on UCLA hitting it.
I was actually able to put that one-pitch-
focus mindset into action. So, it was a great
start to the season, and I'm hoping I'll be
able to carry that same mindset into the rest
of the season."
While her UCLA outing helped the Wol-
verines start the non-conference schedule
outstrong, thejunior'sperfect-performance
against Minnesota kept the team undefeat-
ed in conference play.
"(The perfect game) is a big confidence
builder and momentum pusher," Taylor
said. "You need games like that over the
course of a season. The UCLA (game) was
a good game like that at the beginning of
the year, and the Arizona game was a good
one. You just need those to keep going, oth-
erwise you'll pull your hair out. Today was
agood day."
As long as Taylor keeps pitching the ver-
sion of 'Michigan softball' she's shown this
spring, the Wolverines can expect to con-
tinue winning - and Taylor can expect to
take home a few more awards of her own.

WU J I realized something had to change if
I was going to truly embrace my last
year on campus. In keeping with the
theme of this issue, I'll say that my
senior year bucket list came to con-
sist of one major goal: try something
completely new.
Enter The Michigan Daily.
Traditionally, students get
involved with the paper earlier in
their college careers rather than
later, work their asses off in the name
of editorial freedom through the first
half of their senior year and then
(caffeine + 8 key nutrientS take a much-needed break during
their final semester.
Olin e + choline) Keeping with my own personal
tradition, I was late to this phenom-
enon.
So now, rather than spending my
weeknights drinking with the rest
of the senior class, I'm in the news-
' inw 'rroom, one of only a handful of sec-
. wa er

ond-semester seniors still on staff.
Now bear with me for a moment as
I am a senior and we tend to get sen-
timental. I won't get into specifics or
cheesy, emotional details, but I will
say this about my time at the Daily:
what began as a whim and a group of
people who were merely acquaintanc-
es quickly evolved into a deep respect
for the tradition of the paper and true
friends.
You know a relationship is getting
serious when the realization hits that
you talkto your editors more than your
own parents. But despite the disagree-
ments over headlines, page layouts,
sentence structure and where we'd eat
dinner, my colleagues in the newsroom
became my extended family.
Most are younger than me and at
first I was naturally inclined to think
I knew better. But I quickly learned to
shut up and listen. I now respect this
group of amazing people more than I
think I could ever effectively convey
to them.
They may be just a bunch of col-
lege students with access to a printing
press, but they never cease to amaze
me with their dedication, brilliance
and capacity for simultaneous profes-
sionalism and compassion.
So now that my time at the Daily
is officially over and I realize what a
truly incredible and influential part
of my life it has been, I could easily
bemoan my late start. But rather than
look back and lament "coulda, woul-
da, shoulda," I choose to embrace the
experience I've had.
This maybe mypersonal statement,
my own experience at Michigan, but
the gist of what I'm tryingto say is not
unique to only me. I am positive I am
not the only person on this campus
who has experienced the phenom-
enon of despondency. Looking back
at my seemingly contended fresh-
man self, I am sad for that girl and for
everyone who doesn't embrace new
opportunities when given the chance
or seek an experience other than what
they're used to.
We so often hear people say, "col-
lege is the only time in your life you
can do this" or, "once you're in the
real world, that won't be acceptable."
While I agree to some extent - streak-
ing through the quad probablyisn't OK
when you're married with kids - it's
never reallytoo late. Being ahead of the
curve is overrated.E

editors' note

Smoke a joint, get high
in the Arb
It's the most beautiful spot on campus and the perfect place
to relax, so this one requires zero justification.You'll probably
run into some like-minded people who would love to share in
your adventure. Just be smart and careful - DPS will mess
your shit up if they catch you.

To our readers,
The thought of printing some sort of
Bucket List issue first popped into our
heads at the start of the winter semester. But what
we originally envisioned was something almost
completely different from what follows on these
pages.
In the beginning, we had hoped to ask Daily
seniors to think of that one thing they had always
wanted to do - maybe it was to Kayak down the
Huron River, or rave on Friday night at the Blind
Pig Soul Club - and then go do that thing and write
about the experience.
We pitched the idea to our outgoing seniors
and, after receiving a less-than-overwhelming
response, soon realized we were going to have to
change our approach if we still wanted to make this
issue a reality.
So, instead of leaving it to our seniors, we opened
up for suggestions from anyone we could think of
- our closest friends, Daily staffers of any age and,
most notably, you, our readers.
After a few weeks, we had a list of about 200
different items that at least someone, somewhere,
had on his or her bucket list. Some of the ideas
were great - you'll finda few of them when you flip
through the magazine - while others were, let's
just say, forgettable.

To say it was stressful to compile the list is a bit
of an understatement. At times we didn't really
know if this would even happen. But through it all,
we learned something about ourselves, something
every one of you will probably realize before you
graduate if you haven't already: this community -
both the University and the city of Ann Arbor - has
more to offer us than we ever could have expected
when we were just starry-eyed freshmen, more
than anyone could accomplish in just four years.
Think about what you'd put on your own per-
sonal bucket list. Maybe a friend has told you about
how awesome it was that night he or she did kara-
oke for the first time and recommended you do
the same. Or maybe every time you hear the bells
of the Carillon ringing from the Burton Tower in
between classes you tell yourself you still have to
go up there to take in the view. But somehow these
things we all promised ourselves we'd do just seem
to slip our minds.
Maybe our seniors weren't as excited as we'd
hoped they'd be to participate in this issue was
not because they are lazy, but, rather, because
the thought of contributing to a bucket list forces
them to come face-to-face with a sobering fact:
that the time they have left at the University is
very rapidly coming to an end. Maybe doing that
one thing, the thing they've always wanted to do,

puts a big, fat, figurative period on their time here
as a student.
There's no way to accomplish everything you'd
like before you leave this place. Quite simply,
there's way too much this city has to offer. And
even if you do try, every time you think that you've
completed your 'list', you'll think of a dozen other
things to add to it.
We don't even begin to claim that our Bucket
List is an exhaustive index of everything a Uni-
versity student should do before graduation. Hell,
some of the items on this list aren't even that seri-
ous; we did try to have some fun with this. But if
anything, what our list does is represent an idea:
that we can't, not one of us, let the time we have
here slip us by.
It might not exactly be the 'best years of our
lives,' as everyone older than us claims it is - actu-
ally, we really hope they aren't right about that -
but, if not the best years, definitely some that offer
us a chance to do things we'd never thought we'd
ever do before.
If we have one thing to say after doing this issue,
it's to please, please take full advantage of the time
you have here. You'll never be able to get it back.

~ Men's Glee Club Concert
Last Saturday, the University's Men's Glee Club celebrated its
150th anniversary. The commemorative concert, which packed
Hill Auditorium with more than 400 Glee Club alumni from the
past 67 years and other guests, was the perfect way to check "Glee
Club concert" off mybucket list.
Current Glee members dressed in tuxedos adorned with red
carnations filled HillAuditoriumwithbeautiful harmonies - even
throwing in some dance moves - that resonated off the curved
ceilings of one of the University's oldest performance venues.
The audience at the concert was star studded with the likes of
President Mary Sue Coleman and Athletic Director David Bran-
don.
One of the best parts of the concert included one of the most
unknown aspects of the University - the incredible archive of
"Songs of Michigan." The songs are soaked in U of M pride from
another era of collegiate tradition and left every audience mem-
ber feeling nostalgic for the Michigan of yesteryear.
The concert was the perfect thing to do at the end of my senior
year because it emphasized the amazing talent of Michigan stu-
dents and alumni, and also reminded me that I can always come
back to Ann Arbor.

You've all heard the stereotypes - everyone around the Big
Ten lumps all maize-and-blue fans into the same category.
we're quiet, unrowdy, golf-clappers who sit on our hands dur-
ing games and yawn whenever Michigan scores a touchdown.
My response when someone mentions this to me: "Obvi-
ously, you've never been to a Michigan hockey game."
One step into Yost Ice Arena is enough to make even the
most hardened, sailor-talking ruffians blush and do a few Hail
Marys. The fans are, in one word, brutal.
The student section heckles the goalie, the backup goalie,
the opposing coach, the "ugly parents" in the small section of
fans dedicated to the poor team that happens to be playing the
wolverines that night and, unbelievably, other Michigan fans,
if they're not supporting the team with enough fervor.
And then there's the infamous C-Ya chant, which has caused
thousands of mothers to earmuff their children and was even
featured in an ESPN segment about rowdy fan behavior.
It's not all curse words and heckling, though. These are,

hands down, the most dedicated fans on campus. The Michi-
gan hockey student section isn't like the football one - gone
are the drunk sorority girls who are more concerned with how
their knee-high maize-and-blue stockings look. And unlike
basketball games this year, there's never a bandwagon effect.
Every fan is totally into the game, which is a pretty unbe-
lievable feeling, especially during the second intermission,
when the entire student body dances to that song from the
Blues Brothers.
That's right. Even the intermissions are wild.
It doesn't matter if you're not into hockey - a game at Yost,
specifically against archrival Michigan State, is a must-do for
anyone who considers him or herself a Michigan sports fans.
And I'll bet that, like a Pringle chip, one won't be enough
once you experience the energy of that ol' building on South
State.

one you know watchingthe game on television won't recognize
you.

Fleetwood Diner is one of those spots that is unique and
endearing enough to be a definitive part of the Ann Arbor expe-
rience.
Unfortunately, it falls outside a lot of students' radars because
many believe Ann Arbor is contained between South University
and State Street. ButI promise, a Fleetwood experience is worth
the trek past Main Street.
First, Fleetwood is the only 24-hour restaurant in town. And
if that doesn't immediately interest you, then maybe Fleetwood
just isn't your kind of place.
"Normal" people don'tgo to Fleetwood when it's light out - at
least, I never have. Being the only place open at ridiculous hours
makes Fleetwood a kind of late-night Mecca.
Food wise, expect classic greasy Americana diner fare -
burgers, Reubens, omelettes, apot of coffee always on. But real-
ly, the best part about Fleetwood is its specialties.
Namely Hippie Hash: greasy hash browns topped with broc-
coli, tomatoes, feta cheese and whatever else you want. It's sort
of like if Bob Evans moved to Kerrytown and started getting
down with his bad, green self. I can promise it's the tastiest
thing you will ever eat at a diner.
But really, the thing you'll never forget about Fleetwood is the
environment. The walls are covered in stickers, postcards and
graffiti, and I can't imagine any of the furnishing or equipment
inside has changed much in the last couple decades. There's
even an old boombox the staff keeps going with everything from
Daft Punk to Metallica.
There's usually someone chain smoking and reading at the

This is the easiest task on the list. You really just need to eat at
Zingermann's and you'll be able to check it off. Sandwich, chips
and a drink will set you back at least $20. Just throw in a dessert
and you're there.

counter, a guy you are vaguely concerned might start talking
to you at any moment and some grad students who have been
doing whatever it is they do all night refueling over plates of
food.
Sometimes things get weird - I've seen people get thrown
out for stealing bread from the kitchen - and sometimes there
is a guy that just sits and talks to himself. But it's all part of the
atmosphere.
My most memorable experience at Fleetwood happened with
a friend at 4 a.m. after we had finished some homework. A scrag-
gly looking kid approached us and asked if we had any change
for the bus - he had to get back to East Lansing for classsin a
few hours.
We were bored, so we gave him a ride instead of change.
During the 45-minute drive, we talked about everything from
differing religious views on reincarnation to how Facebook is
fundamentally changing the way our generation interacts with
one another.
If I had to guess, this is pretty tame as far as Fleetwood
encounters go, though.
Fleetwood is not just another restaurant. You'll see and eat
things there you just won't find at other places. Yes, it's dirty,
and yes, the first word a lot of people use to describe it is "gross."
But there's a reason I keep going back and why I never want
it to change. Think of it as an experience that happens to come
with delicious food, not as a restaurant.

obscure performances at
Hill Auditorium
We've all heard it since orientation: "Hill Auditorium has per-
fect acoustics." So why not enjoy one of the many national acts
that come through every year? Even the cheap seats are good
seats.

-7Finally learn how to do - iGet down and dirty in
your own laundry the Stacks

Separate light and dark fabrics. Choose one pile and load into
washing machine. Add detergent. Press 'start.' Wait. Transfer
to dryer. Repeat. Please don't make your mom do your laundry
when she visits for the first time. You got into Michigan; you're
smart enough to figure this out on your own.

And we don't mean in the middle of the night when no one else
is around. Preferably around 7 p.m., during final exams. Thekey
here is making sure you don't make too much noise. Unless you
don't care if the person two doors down can hear your intimate
love making.

Throw a toga party a la
"Animal House"
You know this is exactly what you expected college to be like.
But then you got here and realized Saturday nights freshman
year were actually spent sneaking 3O-racks into the dorms. You
deserve this one lasthurrah for your college career.
