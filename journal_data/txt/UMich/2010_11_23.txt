FACULTY GOVERNANCE
SOfficial says
'U' is making
space for new
faculty hires

IF YOU BUILD IT. THEY WILL COME

At SACUA, Vice
Provost Pollack also
talks budget cuts,
faculty health plan
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily Staff Reporter
Martha Pollack, the University's
vice provost for academic and bud-
getary affairs, told the faculty's
leading governing body yesterday
that University officials are work-
ing to make sure there will be
enough space to accommodate the
150 new faculty members who are
expected to begin working at the
University in the upcoming years.
Pollack said that because not all
of the faculty members are com-
ing to campus at the same time,
there should be enough space to
accommodate everyone. She added
that some of the faculty will also
be housed in the North Campus
Research Complex.
In her talk to the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs yesterday, Pollack also
answered questions about the Uni-
versity's cost cutting plans and the
faculty health plan.
Of the faculty members expect-

ed to arrive on campus in the
near future, 100 were or will be
hired through University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's 2007
faculty initiative, and the Univer-
sity expects to hire SO more using
money centrally allocated in this
year's budget.
Pollack said the University will
repurpose unoccupied classrooms
to be used as faculty offices since
the University has alow classroom
utilization rate of 49 percent.
In response, Stephen Lusmann,
associate voice professor and a
member of SACUA, raised a con-
cern about the lack of practice
rooms available for students at
the School of Music, Theatre and
Dance. Pollack answered Lus-
mann's question by saying she
believes the University has allo-
cated money to create new rooms.
Pollack also told SACUAthat the
University won't cut anything that
detracts from its core educational
mission in order to meet its bud-
get goals in response to a question
from one of the faculty members.
Instead, Pollack said the Univer-
sity will decrease energyusage, cut
down on maintenance costs and
possibly ask the deans of multiple
schools to reduce their budgets in
order to meet its reduction goals

Ann Arbor's pets: Why
campus is nuts for squirrels

North Quad has had mixed
impact, State St eateries say

Expert: Squirrels'
strange behavior due
to too much human
interaction
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Though most students were
probably reaching for umbrellas
and raincoats during yesterday's
torrential downpour, according
to Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Prof. Philip Myers, they should
have been looking at the squirrels.
"Next time you're out in a rain
storm, watch the squirrels," said
Myers, whose research focus is
in small mammals. "Watch how
they use their tails; they use it as
an umbrella. They are able to be
active almost irrespective of the
weather."
The strange behavior of squir-
rels in Ann Arbor has become a
source of fascination for both stu-
dents and visitors to the city. And
according to Myers and squirrel
enthusiasts at the University, their
chubby looks and friendly demean-
or are largely due to the increased
human interaction they experi-
ence around campus.
The city's squirrels have grown
accustomed to the rich source of
food humans provide them, which
to an extent increases their chanc-
es of winter survival, Myers said.
He added that humans' behav-
ior toward the squirrels affects

By KATE HUMMER
For the Daily
The opening of the North Quad
Residential and Academic Com-
plex this August has put hundreds
of students in direct proximity to
South State Street eateries. While

a few restaurants have seen a sig-
nificant increase in business, oth-
ers located right next to North
Quad say they aren't reaping the
benefits of a larger customer base.
North Quad residents say the
limited hours of the dining hall
- lunch is served from 11 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. and dinner from 5 p.m.
to 7 p.m. - cause many students
to resort to eating out.
LSA junior Kristin Kopec, a
North Quad resident, said living
on South State Street is conve-
nient for finding restaurants to
dine in, and cited Noodles and

Company and Potbelly Sandwich
Shop as her frequent choices.
Panera Bread, which is locat-
ed on North University Avenue
about one block from North Quad,
has seen a large increase in cus-
tomers. Panera employee Tenia
Harris, an Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity student, said the cafe has
been busier compared to last fall.
"It's usually really busy

A squirrel poses for a photo on the Diag yesterday. According to Prof. Philip Myers,
Ann Arbor squirrels get too much food from all their human interaction.

their reproductive patterns as
well. Squirrels have two breeding
periods; one in the fall and one in
the spring. When resources are
scarce, they will only breed dur-
ing one period. But given their
abundant source of food, Myers
said Ann Arbor squirrels probably
breed during both periods.
However, Myers said the townie
squirrels consequently act a little
differently than common squirrels
due to their constant feeding and
interaction with humans.

"It makes them actin a less nat-
ural way," Myers said. "However,
it doesn't have any detrimental
effects on their well-being."
He said squirrels have also been
known to make their disapproval
of certain human activities clear.
"They've learned to expect peo-
ple to feed them," he said. "They'll
let you know that they're annoyed
if you don't feed them."

Alley Bar offers

Campus favorites BTB and
Good Time Charley's are better
known for their drink specials
and collegial atmosphere than

for providing classy drinks. But
the bars' owners are getting into
the "townie" market with their
recent acquisition and revamp of
Alley Bar, which they hope will
become the hot spot for getting a
good cocktail.
Alley Bar - located on 112
West Liberty St. - has been a
part of Ann Arbor's bar scene for
more than 30 years, and has expe-
rienced various changes in own-
ership over its lifetime. The bar

re-opened at the end of the sum-
mer after being acquired by the
owners of BTB and Good Time
Charley's, who implemented sev-
eral changes.
According to Ryan Trzcinski,
marketing director of BTB busi-
nesses, the new management
took time to update the look ofthe
bar and increase the selection of
drinks available to patrons.
"We cleaned it up a whole lot,"

What lies beneath Racklam?

Though many campus legends like
stepping on the 'M' in the Diag are
commonly discussed among members
of the incoming freshman class, there
are also those myths that aren't as well
known throughout the student body.
Whether the lore doesn't carry the
same outlandish qualities or seems too
unrealistic, for one reason or another
some myths don't seem to stick. One such
myth is that the Horace H. Rackham
Graduate School was built on a cemetery.
And while the myth hasn't been cir-
culated widely among recent Universi-
ty students, it doesn't make the reality
any less valid: the "myth" is true.
The school, which sits just north of
the Modern Language Building and
University Alumni Association build-
ing on East Washington Street, was
opened in June 1938 after about two
years of construction.
To erect the building, thirty exist-
ing structures - many of them student
houses - had to be demolished.

But demolishing the houses was a
simple task; it was a cemetery on the
grounds that presented a challenging
obstacle.
On the grounds between Huron
Street and East Washington Street was
Michigan's oldest Jewish cemetery.
Established in 1848, the cemetery sat
adjacent to Ann Arbor's public cem-
etery and directly in the path of where
student houses and the Rackham build-
ing were to be built.
To make way for the construction
of structures like the Rackham Gradu-
ate School building and the student
housing that was ultimately replaced
by Rackham, the remains of those
interred at the cemetery were moved
in 1900 to the Forest Hill Cemetery on
Observatory Street.
Now, in its place, sits the headquar-
ters of graduate studies at the Univer-
sity - an Art Deco-style building that
houses administrative offices, two
auditoriums, study spaces, meeting

Lawmakers want to stop
s yteachers' degree bonuses

r5J s

Tight budgets may
spur cutting some
teachers' pay
SEATTLE (AP) - Every year,
American schools pay more than
$8.6 billion in bonuses to teachers
with master's degrees, even though
the idea that a higher degree makes
a teacher more effective has been
mostly debunked.
Despite more than a decade of
research showing the money has

little impact on student achieve-
ment, state lawmakers and other
officials have been reluctant to
tackle this popular way for teachers
to earn more money.
That could soon change, as
local school districts around the
country grapple with shrinking
budgets. Just this week, U.S. Edu-
cation Secretary Arne Duncan said
the economy has given the nation
an opportunity to make dramatic
improvements in the productivity
of its education system and to do
more of what works and less of what

does't.Duncan told the American
Enterprise Institute on Wednesday
that master's degree bonuses are
an example of spending money on
something that doesn't work.
On Friday, billionaire Bill Gates
took aim at school budgets and the
master's degree bonus.
"My own state of Washington
has an average salary bump of
nearly $11,000for a master's degree
- and more than half of our teach-
ers get it. That's more than $300
million every year that doesn't help
kids," he said.

Street, has also seen an increase in
business, according to Cosi Gen-
eral Manager Jon Garcia.
"I can tell you that I'm sure ...
at least a small portion of that is
because of the dorm," Garcia said,
adding that he didn't know exactly
how much profits have increased.
According to Jonathan Kirk,
one of the managers of Amer's
Mediterranean Deli on South
State Street, the addition of North
Quad has contributed to the deli
and yogurt bar's uptick in busi-
ness.
However, some businesses
haven't been affected by the new

dorm. Matt West, an employee of
the South State Street Espresso
Royale location, said he hasn't seen
an increase in traffic since North
Quad opened.
"There's really no change in
business," he said.
While some South State Street
businesses have experienced a
spike in profits, some restaurant
owners say business has been slow
despite North Quad's opening.
The lack of customers may be
due in part to the construction of
a CVS Pharmacy on South State
Street that will be opening in early
2011. Business owners say the con-
struction deters pedestrians from
the area.
Mr. Greek's Coney Island owner
Louie Anton said his restaurant -

located next to the construction
site - has had fewer customers
since construction began.
Bradley Gibson, an assistant
general manager at Buffalo Wild
Wings, which is located next to
Mr. Greeks, also said fewer stu-
dents have come into the restau-
rant since construction started.
"It's the construction that has
the sidewalk closed so students are
not even wanting to come down
this way...(they are) just avoiding
the construction," Gibson said.
He added that once CVS is built,
however, he expects business to
pick up again.
"Once the construction is all
done, I think then we will...actu-
ally see what our full potential can
be," Gibson said.

ALLEY BAR

Trzcinski said.
"We also introduced a menu of
drinks that would allow our bar-
tenders to produce drinks that
(are) not available in Ann Arbor...
drinks that included fresh juice
and fresh herbs," he added in an
e-mail interview.
The price range for the drinks
available at Alley Bar is as diverse
as its beverage selection. High-
end options are available and most
of the cocktails cost less than $10.
Trzcinski said the bar "pro-
vides a really, really great cocktail
without the ego that you some-
times get on Main Street. We're

not trying to be pretentious about
it...this is a dive bar."
Though the bar may have a
multitude of drinks available for
purchase, it does not sell food.
The bar does not have any live
entertainment or music either.
This creates a more intimate envi-
ronment for customers, bar man-
ager Robbie Schulz said.
While the bar is owned by the
same company that oversees cam-
pus favorites like BTB and Good
Time Charley's, the dive bar char-
acter of Alley Bar has remained
intact, management said.
According to Trzcinski, the
acquisition of Alley Bar allowed
BTB to expand its market to cater
to more of the Ann Arbor commu-
nity. He also said the combination

of the bar's "townie" appeal with
its broad drink repertoire will
help make Alley Bar a success.
"We're not trying to...compete
with the other bars," Trzcinski
said. "We're really trying to do
something special on our own
here. A lot of people are starting
to realize that."
Renee Schantz, manager of the
Arbor Brewing Company on East
Washington Street, said despite
Alley Bar's recent efforts to
attract a more adult crowd, she's
not worried about the competi-
tion.
"I don't see (them) impact-
ing us business-wise," Schantz
said. "They didn't have much of
an impact on us when they were
open before."

Security protests in
airports could slow
down holiday travel
CHICAGO (AP) - As if air trav-

isn't tough enough, it could be even
worse this year: Airports could see
even more disruptions because of a
loosely organized Internet boycott
of full-body scans.
Even if only a small percentage of
passengers participate, experts say
it could mean longer lines, bigger
delays and hotter tempers.
The protest, National Opt-Out
Day, is scheduled for Wednesday
to coincide with the busiest travel
day of the year. The Obama admin-
istration's top transportation secu-
rity official implored passengers
yesterday not to participate, saying
boycotts would only serve to "tie up
people who want to go home and
see their loved ones."
"Justoneor two recalcitrant pas-
sengers at an airport is all it takes
to cause huge delays," said Paul
Ruden, a spokesman for the Ameri-
can-Society of TravelAgents, which
has warned its more than 8,000
members about delays resulting
from the body-scanner boycott.

Pope seeks to start
debate on condoms
Pope Benedict XVI sought to
"kick-start a debate" when he said
some condom use may be justified,
Vatican insiders say, raising hopes
the church may be starting to back
away from a complete ban and
allow condoms to play a role in the
battle against AIDS.
Just a year after he said con-
doms could be making the AIDS
crisis worse, Benedict said that for
some people, such as male prosti-
tutes, using them could be a step
in assuming moral responsibility
because the intent is to "reduce
the risk of infection."
The pope did not suggest using
condoms as birth control, which
is banned by the church, or men-
tion the use of condoms by mar-
ried couples where one partner is
infected. ,
Still, some saw the pope's com-
ments as an attempt to move the
church forward on the issue of
condoms and health risks.

package to other institutions and
has found that overall its benefits
are in line with comparable plans.
But because this is an overall mea-
sure, Pollacksaid singularbenefits
might be higher or lower than the
average.
SALARY TASK FORCE
SHARES FINDINGS
Larry Boxer, a professor in the

Department of Pediatrics and
Communicable Diseases and chair
of SACUAs Salary Task force, also
discussed the task force's findings
at yesterday's meeting.
Rothman said the task force
was created to investigate if the
salary reduction plan in the Uni-
versity's medical school - which
was applied across the medical
campus in 2007 - could affect
other units on campus.
Reading the task force report
given to SACUA, Kim Kearfott,
SACUA member and professor
of Engineering, said the group
found that the salary reduction
plan won't have an impact on
other University departments. But
despite the findings, Kearfott said
she was concerned that the salary
plan could be used as precedent
for the creation of salary plans in
other schools.
Boxer said thatunder the medi-
cal school's current plan, a faculty
member's salary can be lowered if
he or she refuses to take on extra
teaching hours or fails to perform
at a high level when conducting
research. A faculty member's sal-
ary could also go down if the fac-
ulty member opts to reduce the
amount of time he or she works as
retirement nears.
Salary reductions are made at
the time of the annual review of

faculty, Boxer said.
The plan was widely accepted
by the medical school's clinical
departments, but hasn't yet been
adopted by the school's science
departments, Boxer said.
Rothman also discussed the
task force's examination of how
the salary planaffected Bylaw So9,
a University Board of Regents's
bylaw that determines what issues
constitute a faculty grievance.
Because one of the issues consti-
tuting a grievance is demotion,
Rothman said he's concerned that
the medical faculty could claim
their reduced salary under the
plan as a grievance.
Boxer said he doesn't believe
there was ever any discussion in
the medical school about a salary
reduction constituting a demotion.
Kearfott and other faculty
members also expressed disagree-
ment with the fact that new facul-
ty members are not made aware of
the details of the salary reduction
plan in their letters of hire.
SACUA Vice Chair Gina Poe
said she feels there will be an
influx of grievances from medi-
cal school faculty members who
were hired just before the salary
plan was implemented and may
not be aware of its implications
as their third-year evaluations
approach.

received these new lids yet.
"However, regardless of what
recycling bins are currently
labeled, all recyclables can be
placed in them," she said.
Officials hope the ease of recy-
cling will encourage more people
to place their reusable materials in
recyclingbins instead oftrashcans.
Single-stream recycling has
enhanced recycling efforts at the
Big House, particularly since plas-
tic cups are now accepted recy-
clables, according to Richardson.
She wrote that with the help of the
newly labeled bins there's been an
increase in both the recycling rate
and amount of recyclables collect-
ed this football season compared
to the 2009 season.
Residence halls have also
made the switch. According to
Richardson, University Waste
Management Services has made
a concerted push to improve stu-
dents' awareness of the new sys-
tem-through posters, table tents
in dining halls and distributing
educational materials to residen-
tial advisors.
LSA junior Heather Burcham
said she hasn't been a big recycler,
but thinks she will recycle more
now because of the new system.
"We don't recycle at home," she
said. "It's a good way for me to
get started with it by just putting
everything in one bin."

ment Services planned America

ral conditions, it's reasonable for
people to feed them. He said squir-
rels, more than any kind of wild
mammal, seem more comfortable
around humans.
However, Myers said, there are
some downsides to the constant
attention given to the squirrels.
"From our perspective, squir-
rels can be pests sometimes and
we encourage them too much," he
said. "You also don't want to get
too close to them, they could bite
you."
The food given to them also
leads to "unusually high densi-
ty" squirrels, Myers said. Larger
squirrels have a higher chance of
losing most of their fur as well assa
higher probability of transmission
of parasites.
Though these fatter squirrels
are pretty easy to spot on campus,
they've become a more visible part
of campus culture partly due to
the University's Squirrel Club that
was founded a few years ago.
Club founder and University
alum Jason Colman said the group
started as a late night dorm con-
versation and grew into a group
full of squirrel enthusiasts.
"First of all, it's fun." Col-
man said. "Secondly, a lot of peo-
ple enjoy feeding the squirrels
because they miss their pets at
home. The squirrels are the cam-
pus pets and they are cute and
fuzzy. It's also a stress reliever."
He said the best way to feed and

Recycles Day to educate members
of the University community on
the new system. Richardson orga-
nized charter buses to transport
about 25 University staff and stu-
dents to takea tour of Ann Arbor's
MRF and learn more about how
the recycling process works.
"We received a lot of positive
feedback from those who attend-
ed, andthere are many others who
would have liked to attend, so we
will likely plan something similar
in the spring," Richardson wrote.
In addition to boosting recy-
cling at some University loca-
tions, the single-stream system
has increased recycling activity
throughout Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti, with the amount of recycla-
ble material brought to MRF more
than doubling, according to Thom-
as McMurtrie, city solid waste
coordinator and systems planner.
He added that the amount of
recyclables received from curb-
side residential programs in Ann
Arbor increased 17.3 percent,
while the recycling rate increased
from 33.3 percent to 38.5 percent.
The amount of disposed waste
also decreased 5.9 percent.
McMurtrie and Richardson
agreed that the next few months
would better indicate the success
of the new program.
"It has been less than three
months since the switch," Rich-
ardson wrote, referring to this
semester. "We'll have a better
handle on increases in recycling
as the year progresses."
Ann Arbor's recycling infra-
structure had to undergo major
interact with the squirrels is to
master the "squirrel noise" which
he demonstrated by making con-
tinuous clicking sounds.
"It's absolutely key that you
have a good squirrel noise," he
said. "Practice. Practice in front of
the mirror when no one's around."
He said that making the squir-
rel noise, crouching down and
holding out a peanut will capture
the creature's attention, making
it get on its hind legs and observe
you curiously as it approaches you.
Current Squirrel Club president
and LSA junior Peter Fengsaid the
group is still around because it's a
curious novelty of the school and a
source of pride for tour guides in
explaining the wide range of cam-
pus groups.
"This legend keeps it alive,"
Feng said.
He said there are over 900
members on the mailing list and
speculates these students were
attracted to the group because of
how "small and chubby" the squir-
rels are. He added, "A lot of people
think they're pretty cute too."
The 900 or so Squirrel Club
members aren't the University's
only fans of these furry critters.
LSA senior Evan Begun said
he is "obviously a big fan" of the
squirrels.
"I only like the ones in the Diag
and the Law Quad though because
they are receptive to human
advances," Begun said.
He also said he feels bad for the
"scrawnier ones" in Ann Arbor.
LSA senior Scott Schwartz said
the Ann Arbor squirrels are "fan-

changes in order to put the single-
stream system into place. Accord-
ing to the city's recycling website,
it cost $3.25 million to upgrade the
MRF to a single-stream collection
line.
McMurtrie wrote in an e-mail
interview that the plant was shut
down for about six weeks while
the new sorting line was installed.
In that time, the city's recyclables
were transferred to another facil-
ity.
According to a Michigan Radio
July2010 video, thenew machines
are used to loosen, separate and
package the various materials into
bales. Workers watch conveyor
belts to make sure the machines
are sorting effectively. From the
MRF, the recyclable materials are
sold to companies like Anheuser-
Busch and the Packaging Corpo-
ration of America to make new
goods, McMurtrie wrote.
"The new system is more auto-
mated than the previous system,
so the same number of sorters can
process quite a bit more material,"
McMurtrie wrote.
"He added that "the old two-
stream system processed between
four and ten tons per hour, while
the new plant's capacitylts 20 tons
per hour.
As part of the transition, the
city had to invest in new recycling
bins for residents, adding another
$1.4 million to program costs,
according to the city's website.
However, savings from single-
stream recycling are expected to
repay the investment within seven
years.
tastic."
"They're docile and they're
smart," Schwartz said. "They
know a lot and they're not easily
scared. I like that."
However, LSA senior Honesty
Lee said he likes the squirrels but
doesn't like the idea that they are
constantly being fed.
"They become really fat and
that's why they become docile,"
Lee said. "That's why they've
become, I'd say, unnatural. You
know, squirrels aren't supposed to
be enormous."
"I'd say they're abnormal," he
added.
Medical student Tom Michni-
acki said he enjoys the squirrels
despite their size.
"They're entertaining," Mich-
niacki said. "I think there could be
repercussions to feeding them but
they seem pretty hygienic. I doubt
they have that many diseases so
it's probably not that bad to feed
them."
Myers said the category these
squirrels fall under is "tree squir-
rel" - more specifically known as
fox squirrels - but there are two
other types of squirrels on campus
that one wouldn't expect to fall
under the squirrel category.
Chipmunks and woodchucks
are also types of squirrels in the
"ground squirrel" category, he
said. The chipmunks zip around
campus at their leisure during the
summer months and the wood-
chucks are usually found on North
Campus. Both of these animals
hibernate, whereas the fox squir-
rels don't.

A safety check for DPS
University needs to review campus trespass policy
J tcan be difficult for the University to maintain a balance
between protecting students and abusing power. This can
become particularly complicated when political protests
cross into disruptive or threatening behavior. Recently, the Uni-
versity has been criticized for its trespass policy - especially in
regard to the Andrew Shirvell case. The American Civil Liber-
ties Union of Michigan has questioned the constitutionality and
implementation of the University's policy. While the power to
issue trespass orders is an essential tool for keeping students safe,
the University's Department of Public Safety must re-evaluate its
trespass policy to avoid giving DPS excessive power.

North Quad's blemishes

On Sept. 14, former Michigan assistant
attorney general Andrew Shirvell was
issued a trespass order that banned him
from campus in response to behavior that
DPS considered threatening to Michigan
Student Assembly President Chris Arm-
strong. Earlier this month, the order was
modified to allow Shirvell on campus except
for at events at which Armstrong is likely
to be present. Last week, the undergradu-
ate chapter of the ACLU here on campus
suggested that the trespass order threat-
ens Shirvell's First Amendment rights and
asked the University to modify the policy.
Shortly thereafter, the ACLU of Michi-
gan said it was looking into the policy and
is considering filing a lawsuit. University
President Mary Sue Coleman told the Daily
last week that it would be "appropriate" for
the office of General Council to examine
the policy to determine if it needs revision.
The ACLU's requestto reconsider the tres-
pass policy seems sensible - but its request
to have Shirvell's trespass warning reviewed
or revoked is unwarranted. Shirvell's
increasingly extreme behavior this summer
- includingshowingup at events Armstrong
was attending and even showing up outside
Armstrong's house - justifies the trespass
order. The modifications made to the order
in early November are adequate to allow
Shirvell on campus grounds while continu-
ing to protect Armstrong.
There is merit to the ACLU's claim that
the University's trespass policy gives too

much power to individual DPS officers
and lacks an appropriate appeal process.
Currently, the University's trespass policy
allows all 56 DPS officers to issue a trespass
warning at their discretion, which gives
a fair amount of power to a lot of people,
increasing the likelihood that it could be
misused. Additionally, the warnings are
lifetime bans. At Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity, bans expire after one year. A one-year
ban on Shirvell would be sufficient to pro-
tect Armstrong, who is expected to gradu-
ate in April.
And only DPS Director Ken Magee has
the power to overturn a trespass order.
Those who wish to appeal a trespass order
must meet personally with Magee to argue
their case. While Magee has dealt appro-
priately with the Shirvell order, there is no
guarantee that future directors will show
proper discretion. And the director of DPS
isn't a disinterested third party. Though
there's no evidence that Magee has acted
inappropriately, it's concerning that there is
clearly the opportunity to do so. The power
to revise orders should be entrusted to the
Department of Public Safety Oversight
Committee, an impartial body that can
make an objective decision.
The ability to enact trespass orders is
important to protect students and other
members of the University community -
but it shouldn't be abused. DPS must revise
its trespass policy to ensure that orders are
issued only for appropriate reasons.

I f you've passed by North Quad
or if you've spent a couple min-
utes perusing its grounds, you
were probably
impressed. This is a
completely normal
reaction, I assure
you. But after liv-
ing there for the
past three months,
I've got to tell you
that North Quad
is hardly the resi-
dential paradise MATTHEW
you might imagine
from a quick walk GREEN
through its halls of _
faux marble.
To be sure, it
starts out great. You walk into this
beautiful new building and you can't
help but admire the delicately placed
wood paneling and crown molding
above. From sweeping windows, you
take in a grand view of the "collegiate
gothic" architecture as you look out
into an impressive courtyard, replete
with a colonnade and arched entry-
ways. But soon you'll notice - as you
begin to text your friends about the
building's perfectly placed study
spots - that you're probably out of
cell reception. Indeed, this is just the
beginning. By this point, North Quad
has you in its snare.
If you're hungry and you have a
meal plan, you might think you want
to try out the cafeteria. After all,
you've probably heard fantastical sto-
ries about the food there, but be fore-
warned. The dining hall will woo you
with vaulted ceilings, chandeliers and
a gourmet menu touting shark, sushi
and creative tofu dishes. And admit-
tedly, the food itself is pretty good. But
the portions! Oy. If you enjoy a dish
(perhaps a nice Midori vegetable med-
ley) you'll probably have to go up two
or three times - and then wait in line
- in order to get a satisfying amount

of food. Sure, no one's stopping you
from going back to get as much as you
want, but the crowded room will make
doing so a real pain.
of course, that's the real problem
about dining in North Quad - the
crowd. If you're hoping to find a table
for four at lunch or dinnertime, you
may have to wait a while to find a
comfortable spot to enjoy that rack of
lamb. There's clearly nothing anyone
can do about the limitation of physi-
cal space in the dining hall, but per-
haps if its hours of operation were
extended past the current impossibly
short window of time, the bottleneck
may ease up a bit. As of right now, the
cafeteria is open for lunch from 11
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and for dinner from
5 p.m. to 7 p.m. - and only on week-
days. For less congestion, University
Housing ought to consider extend-
ing the hours to go continuously
from lunch through dinner. That's
what East and South Quads do, and it
seems to work swimmingly.
And if you want breakfast during
the week, you'd better have blue bucks
or dining dollars to pay for the a la
carte menu. This, too, is a despicable
fact of life in North Quad. Diners in its
state-of-the-art cafeteria deserve the
same breakfast opportunities as their
counterparts in other dining halls.
How can North Quad residents go on
to cure cancer or win a Pulitzer Prize
if their meal plan doesn't allow them
to conveniently eat the most impor-
tant meal of the day?
But I digress. While food may be
the first thing on my mind, one could
argue that the real North Quad expe-
rience is upstairs - where residents
actually live. So how about those top
seven floors? Apart from the pleasant
color schemes and mod furniture in
the study lounges, the rooms them-
selves aren't all that different from
those in older dorms. My single room,
at least, is almost identical to my pre-

vious single in East Quad, but with
none of the charm. And the closet
space is practically nil.
At first I was thrilled to see that
with new lighting technology, the
rooms and hallways in North Quad
at least have the illusion of conserv-
ing energy. But when you take into
account that there are two plasma
screen televisions on every floor - one
of which is on at all times to showcase
the North Quad Twitter feed - you
realize that this commitment to ener-
gy conservation is only half-hearted.
And though two of the University's
recent building projects have LEED
certification, North Quad isn't among
them. To be fair, many components
of the building - from water flow
controls to maximal insulation to the
heating system - are all reportedly
eco-friendly. But with a price tag of
$175 million, the University could've
sprung for the qualifications neces-
sary for all-out LEED certification.
This new dorm
isn't the paradise
you might think.
Surely, North Quad has its merits.
But when everyone on campus is rav-
ing about it, I can't help but point out
its imperfections. As I always say, it
may have dual flush toilets, but its toi-
let paper is as coarse as ever. I know
you know what I'm talking about.
Needless to say, the University's lat-
est residence hall doesn't sit well
with me. And, clearly, that's not just
because of the toilet paper.

Re-work registration rules

Pursuing the semester's theme

It's thattime of year again: Students are antici-
pating Thanksgiving break and finals are loom-
ing in the distance. With this comes registering
for classes for Winter2011, an exciting process as
the University offers a wide range of classes. But
for some of us - like me - registration can be a
terribly stressful time.
Before the option of backpacking even opened,
I was already thinking of what classes I wanted
to take. Since this is the last semester during
which I will have the opportunity to take first-
year seminars, my tentative schedule includes at
leastone - and hopefullytwo -of them.So when
backpacking began on Nov. 15,I was ready at my
computer to pick my classes. Since I had already
gone through the course guide and crafted a per-
fect schedule, I was ready to backpack as soon as
it went live. But then I remembered I needed to
check my registration date. At that point, I found
that I will not be registering until Dec. 13 - one
of the latest possible days. I was furious as I saw
my perfect semester start to slip away.
I didn't understand why I was in one of the
worst situations possible. As a freshman, I have
only backpacked and registered for classes
once before and that was at orientation. At ori-
entation, you register the d'ay after you back-
pack, so you know exactly what your schedule
will be. Later, I was informed that registration
dates were determined by the amount of cred-
its a student has. So a senior would have an ear-
lier registration date than a freshman - which
I'm fine with. They should have priority. But
what I didn't understand was why one of my
close friends - also a freshman - had a reg-
istration date almost two weeks before mine. I
then learned that Advanced Placement credits
were the determining factor.
But as freshmen, we're all relatively in the
same boat and no one has really had the oppor-
tunity to establish themselves here on campus.

I don't think that using AP credits as a way of
determining registration dates is fair.
I understand that some people come in with
many AP credits - and that's great for them.
But some of us aren't that lucky. As a student
from a very small high school (only 97 students
in my graduating class), we were only offered
a small number of AP classes. So I had fewer
opportunities to earn AP credits than my peers
from larger high schools. I don't think students
like me who didn't have the chance to take as
many AP classes should be punished when it
comes to registering for classes.
Aside from the AP credits, there's also the
issue of student-athletes. In a Daily article
from November 2008, it was reported that
"athletes will receive priority over non-ath-
letes when registering for classes." Athletic
officials backed up their policy by saying that
athletes typically travel on Fridays and there-
fore need to be able to schedule classes around
travel times. I agree that it can be more diffi-
cult for an athlete to craft a schedule because
they want to miss as little class as possible, but
it's completely unnecessary for them to have
the first registration dates. In my opinion, it's
not difficult to find a schedule that would allow
you to not have class of Fridays.
So between the student-athletes - which
I'm not - and the people with a ridiculous
amount of AP credits - which I don't have -
I'm stuck with a poor registration date. I may
sound like I'm just complaining because I have
a late date, but there are other students in the
same situation as me. We all pay to attend the
University, and we should all be given an equal
chance to get the education we want. The Uni-
versity needs to implement a better way of
assigning registration dates.
Ashley Griesshammer is an SA freshman.

uring my first few days back
on campus at the end of
August, the banners adorning
South University
made my flutter-
ing back-to-school
butterflies feel a
bit heavy. Univer-
sity students and-
Olympic ice danc-
ers Meryl Davis
and Charlie White
smiled down at me
wearing tee-shirts LIBBY
that bore the Uni-
versity's fall 2010 ASHTON
semester theme:
"What makes life
worth living?" And
in that moment, I was reminded of my
purpose at the University, which is to
find my own answer to that question.
I can't remember being aware that
the University had semester themes
before this one. Perhaps I was pre-
sented with them but didn't register
their weight because they weren't as
jarring - neither in meaning nor in
structure - as this one. Examples of
past and upcoming theme semester
titles include "The Universe: Yours to
Discover" (Winter 2009), "Meaning-
ful Objects: Museums in the Acad-
emy" (Fall 2009 and Winter 2010)
and "Water" (Winter 2011). These
are simple declarations of things
that exist and the implication that
the University intends to spend the
semester learning more about their
significance.
But this semester, the theme is an
entirely different form. By posing a
question to students, it reaches out
and grabs at our cores as conscious,
rational beings. Mere comprehension
of the question makes us vulnerable
to its power - the source of which is
the possibility that we won't be able
to answer it. This semester's theme,
unlike any other, pulls us into an
existential debate with ourselves,
even if just for a moment.
Psychology Prof. Christopher
Peterson and Director of the Uni-

versity's Center for Ethics in Public
Life John Chamberlin, the professors
responsible for organizing the semes-
ter theme "What Makes Life Worth
Living?," set out to engage us in a pos-
itive search for our own answers. In
an e-mail interview, Chamberlin said
that the theme's structure as a ques-
tion "provides an active prompt to an
individual to think about what makes
life meaningful for her/him." This
exploration, he thinks, is essential
to a liberal arts education and often
doesn't receive enough engagement
in our curriculum.
Peterson, who came up with the
idea for this semester's theme, said in
an e-mail interview that the question
"has been, is, and will be important."
He said his career as a positive psy-
chologist is defined as "the scientific
study of what makes life worth living."
The question is central to both Cham-
berlin's and Peterson's professional
lives. Their work to make it a Univer-
sity-wide focus this semester reminds
us of its centrality to our own lives.
It seems strange that we would
need to be reminded to think about
the reasons behind our walking these
streets, writing papers and maintain-
ing relationships. As beings whose
capacity to question makes us dis-
tinct, I'd think we wouldn't lose sight
of the most fundamental question we
could ask: Why are we? Though it
may be a contradiction, people - and
the institutions they comprise - are
often lost in the muck that distracts
from considering the meaning of life.
Governments around the world
have mistaken measures of wealth
and power to be synonymous with
measures of happiness. And, in doing
so, have faulted on their commitment
to their peoples' pursuits of happiness.
A British daily newspaper, The Guard-
ian, recently ran an article announc-
ing the United Kingdom's plans to
begin measuring the happiness of its
citizens in an effort to ensure that
Britain's general well-being is "at
the heart of future government pol-
icy-making." According the article,

"France and Canada are looking at
similar initiatives as governments
around the world come under pres-
sure to put less store on conventional
economic measures of prosperity such
as gross domestic product."
Britain plans to measure happiness
by gathering information on "subjec-
tive well-being" and an "objective
sense of how well they are achieving
their 'life goals."'While the intentions
of the British government certainly
seem to be nobly in the interest of its
citizens, how can they be sure that
their citizens' "life goals" are any less
misguided than the government's pri-
oritization of the GDP? As Peterson
pointed out, there's a scientific field
of study dedicated to discerning what
makes our lives worth living. It's likely
that many of us don't always live in the
interest of our happiness.
We're distracted
from considering
the meaning of life.
The answers to the semester's
theme "What makes life worth liv-
ing?" are as important to discover as
they are elusive. The answer depends
on the individual, making it impera-
tive that each person works to dis-
cover the meaning of her or his own
life so as never to forget that such a
meaning exists. This column alone
isn't long enough to highlight any
especially resonant declarations of
life's meaning. In my next column,
I'll attempt to (modestly) substanti-
ate the meaning of life by exploring
how various individuals, fields and
disciplines answer the question. But
until then - and even after - explore
the question yourself.

gan football NOTEBOOK
team, for the
past six years, that has meant a
loss.
Does this cause the rivalry to
lose some of its luster? After all,
it's hard to call a game a "rivalry"
when one team keeps beating the
other.
"To say it's less important?"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said at Monday's press conference.
"No. Never. Not Ohio State-Mich-
igan."
The last time Michigan beat
Ohio State was in 2003, when
many of today's Wolverines were
just getting started in high school.
One player, redshirt sophomore
safety Jordan Kovacs, remembers
the 35-21 Wolverine victory in the
Big House fondly.
"I was here at the game," Kovacs
said. "I was 13 years old and obvi-
ously that was the 100th game. I
was sitting in section 27 with my
parents and my brother, so that
was a big win for us."
Most of the players who took the
podium on Monday, though, hard-
ly remember that game.
In Ann Arbor, the game takes
on added meaning with every year
that passes without a Wolverine
victory.
"It means a lot, not just for me
but for the seniors the past six
years who didn't get a chance to go
out beating them," fifth-year senior
offensive guard Stephen Schilling
said. "It's been a couple classes
now that have gone through here
without getting a chance to beat
them so it means a lot for me and
this team but also for those guys I
played with the past few years."
THAT WEIRD STUFFED BEAVER

After the first game of the sea-
son, Michigan men's basketball
coach John
Beilein spoke
about getting
his new play-
ers "under
the lights" in
Crisler Arena.
Well, it's
about to get
a lot brighter CHANTEL
when the team JENNINGS
hits Atlantic
City this Fri-
day for the Championship Round
of the Legends Classic.
Players and coaches have
referred to their matchup with
Syracuse as a measuring stick of
sorts. I suppose that would put
their last three victories in the
arena of sprigs or maybe those
bugs that look like sticks.
After each game, the Wolver-
ines have politely referred to
their respective opponents as
strong teams. But, in all honesty,
those are the teams they're sup-
posed to beat, the games in which
they're supposed to shine - that's
why they're called tune-up
games.
It's like in The Longest Yard
when Burt Reynolds says to Adam
Sandler that "in college, we'd
start every season against Appa-
lachian State or some slack Divi-
sion II team ... kick the living shit
out of them. Get their confidence
up."
Oh ... nevermind. Bad example.
But Syracuse represents a new
echelon of opponents that this
young team hasn't seen yet. The
Orange aren't Bowling Green ... or
Gardner-Webb ... or South Caro-
lina- Upstate.
Hell, they're not even South
Carolina.
They are Syracuse - a team
that built its reputation on one
of the most aggressive trapping-
style, 2-3 zone defenses in the
country. It's so effective that
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim has
a 57-minute long instructional
video detailing how to run this
defense ($39.95, available on
Amazon).
Boeheim normally stacks that
defense with some of the lon-
gest and quickest athletes in the
country, making it look like an
imposing redwood forest. And
this Friday, Syracuse's bottom
three defenders will stand as sti-
fling 6-foot-7, 6-foot-9 and 7-foot
titans.
The 2-3 zone defense is danger-
ous because when run properly,
it clogs the interior - practically
shutting down dribble penetra-
tion and post play. Usually, this
leaves the wings open for 3-point-
ers or long jumpers. But with
the way Boeheim normally com-
mands this defense and how the

Orange aggressively trap the ball,
it usually translates into an abun-
dance of steals and turnovers.
But this isn't about Boeheim,
how he coaches or even his
resume - 27 NCAA Tournament
appearances, five Big East Tour-
nament Championships, eight Big
East regular-season Champion-
ships.
It's about the 10 players on the
court and what they do with Boe-
heim's direction.
And that being said, Boeheim
referred to his team as being "the
most overrated team that (he's)
ever had" in his 34 years at Syra-
cuse.
That was before Syracuse nar-
rowly skated by a winless William
and Mary in the second round
of the Legends Classic. That was
before his team shot 36.7 percent
from the field against that same
team, before they shot 5-for-22
from behind the arc.
But don't get me wrong: there
are certain things that have noth-
ing to do with being overrated.
So long as their hands aren't but-
tered on Friday, the Syracuse post
players should own the glass.
While redshirt freshman Jor-
dan Morgan has proven to be a
dominant post player in the Wol-
verines' first three games, it will
be much harder for him to pull
down eight-plus rebounds when
he's going up against three bodies
as big, if not bigger, than him.
But if Morgan and the rest
of the Michigan frontcourt can
occupy the lane, pockets will
open up in the zone for Wolverine
shooters. And long shots mean
long rebounds, so junior Zack
Novak and sophomore Darius
Morris may find themselves lead-
ing the rebounders' category on
the statistics sheet, which may
not be a bad thing.
Regardless, Friday's game will
be a matchup between a team
fighting to stay in the top 10 and
a team looking to shock anyone
it can.
In Monday's teleconference
with Boeheim, when asked why
his team has always been able to
beat Beilein's teams, he quickly
responded, "We've had better
players. That's all."
Boeheim may be right and he
may have the better players again
this time. But neither Syracuse
nor Michigan have singular stars
- they've both made it clear, at
least this far into the season, that
they're team oriented. And on any
given day a good team can take
down a better team.
So the question is not who has
the better players right now, but
which is the better team on Fri-
day?

Ohio State running back Dan Herron celebrates the Buckeyes' win over Michigan last season at the Big House.

THING: By this time, most Michi-
gan fans have seen the video. It
depicts defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson shoving a stuffed beaver
toy in the face of redshirt sopho-
more linebacker Kenny Demens
after the defense came off the field
in the third quarter.
It was strange. Even stranger
might be the way the defensive
players clamped up when asked
about it during Monday's press
conference.
"Are you saying there's an ani-
mal on the sidelines? Next ques-
tion," sophomore defensive end
Craig Roh said, completely devoid
of humor.
When junior nose tackle Mike
Martin stepped up to the podi-

um he was questioned about the
stuffed animal as well, but though
his answer was slightly less resent-
ful, it was still cryptic.
"That's a secret, that's kind of
our thing," Martin said. "That's
a defense thing. I can't talk about
that."
But it does exist, right? The
stuffed beaver?
"If you see it, I guess it exists,"
Martin said, smiling.
INJURY REPORT: When asked
for an update on his injured play-
ers, Rodriguez said his hands were
tied.
"I'd love to give you an update,
but I have so many names," Rodri-
guez said. "Counting the guys out
for the year, there's probably about

20 guys out of practice."
He said Michigan had multiple
players suffering from headaches
and concussion-like symptoms
and until they get cleared by the
doctor, they won't be able to go in
practice. He was optimistic that
most of the players knocked out of
the Wisconsin game would be able
to go.
The team still isn't sure about
junior wideout Darryl Stonum's
ankle, which he injured during
Saturday's game. Jeremy Gallon's
shoulder will be day-to-day and
Martin "should be okay." He and
senior linebacker Jonas Mouton
will be a little limited, Mouton
with a chest injury suffered a cou-
ple weeks ago.

Michigan's penalty kill picks up slack in
weekend sweep of Lake Superior State

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
While the No. 8 Michigan hock-
ey team's power play has been
stagnant - the
man-advantage NOTEBOOK
unit hasn't tallied
a power play goal since its game
against Ferris State on Oct. 30 -
the Wolverines' penalty kill has
picked up the slack.
After allowing at least one penal-
ty kill goal in all of its prior match-
ups this season, the Michigan
penalty kill hasn't let up a goal in its
past four contests. This past week-
end against Lake Superior State,
the Wolverines' penalty kill stifled
all six Laker power plays, holding
Lake Superior State to just three
power play shots all series.
Senior forward Scooter Vaughan
even tallied a shorthanded goal in
Friday night's 7-2 rout of the Lakers.
"It's part of our game," junior
defenseman Brandon Burlon said
after practice Monday. "If our
power play is not working, our pen-
alty kill has to be. Right now, we're
struggling with our power play a
little bit, but we definitely know
that our penalty kill is going to help
us win games. We can't just rely on
our power play on special teams."
The Michigan penalty kill unit
currently ranks 21st in the nation,
having killed 59 of its 69 penal-
ties. But the recent rise in the Wol-
verines' effectiveness with a man
down has been accompanied by a

time Michigan scored seven goals
in one game this season. It was also
the first time the Wolverines have
scored four goals in one period (as
they did in the first), and the fourth
time they have scored three or
more goals in a period this season.
The four-line contribution on
offense this weekend was a morale
booster for the Michigan forwards,
who know they don't have to rely on
just one guy to score. As this week-
end proved, the Wolverines have
multiple go-to guys who can put up
points in any game.
"Hockey is a huge confidence
sport," Hagelin said. "If you feel
good about yourself and you feel
good about the team, it's easier
to play. You want to work hard
because you know it's going to ben-
efit you in the long run. Going into
this weekend, we know we're going
to play offensive teams ... we know
we're going to get our chances and
hopefully put a few in."
NOTES: With only 17 days
remaining until The Big Chill at the
Big House - the outdoor hockey
game to be played by the Wolver-
ines and Michigan State in Michi-
gan Stadium - construction on the
Olympic-sized ice rink began this
past weekend. There is a live web
cam on the athletic department's
website that will track the progress
of the rink's construction.... Michi-
gan faces two non-conference road
contests at Wisconsin and Minne-
sota this weekend during the 18th
annual College Hockey Showcase.

SALAM RIDA/Daily
Senior forward Carl Hagelin has recorded at least a point in five straight games.

decline in penalty minutes taken
per game.
Before the Notre Dame series
two weekends ago, Michigan
(7-2-1-0 CCHA, 8-3-3 overall) had
taken an average of 18.3 minutes
per game, tied for fifth-highest in
the country at that time. But the
Wolverines have shaved nearly
three minutes off that total in the
past two weekends. Michigan now
ranks 19th in penalty minutes,
averaging 15.43 minutes in the box
per game.
"We are a team that prides our-
selves in playing good (defense),"
senior forward Carl Hagelin said.

"We have a lot of good penalty kill-
ers out there, but it always helps to
have a low penalized game. We're
trying to cut down our penalties,
and if the refs want to keep it low,it's
fine with us. We know we can kill off
three or four penalties each game
because we know we're capable of
doing that. We create a lot of chanc-
es on the (penalty kill) as well."
OFFENSIVE OUTPUT: When the
Wolverines put up seven goals on
Lake Superior State on Friday, each
forward recorded at least one point,
with the exception of freshman
Jacob Fallon.

Blue takes 22nd at NCAAs, Smith leads team with 47th-place finish

'M' disappointed
with finish, looks to
improve next season
By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
For the first time this season, it
was not redshirt junior Danielle
Tauro who crossed the line first for
the No. 17 Michigan women's cross
country team.
Instead, it was sophomore Jill
Smith.

The Wolverines took 22nd
place at the NCAA Championship
on Monday at the LaVern Gibson
Championship Course in Terre
Haute, Ind., finishing with a score
of 476.
Smith finished her first NCAA
meet in 47th place with a time of
20:57.2, missing All-American hon-
ors by just four seconds. This is the
first time in seven years that the
Wolverines didn't claim an indi-
vidual All-American honor at the
NCAA meet.
"We were disappointed with
today," Michigan coach Mike

McGuire said Monday. "We started
the season ranked 27th and worked
our way up the ladder, so to take a
couple steps back down the rungs is
disappointing."
Villanova's Sheila Reid took top
honors, helping the Wildcats earn
their second consecutive cross
country national championship.
"Jill was at the meet last year,
but wasn't able to run because she
was ill," McGuire said. "So for her
first meet, that was pretty darn
good. She stepped up, so that added
something positive."
The 6.000-meter event started

off slow, with a 5:20 initial mile,
due to windy conditions on the
raceway.
Through the 5,000-meter m'ark,
the front pack stayed congested,
making it difficult for runners to
make big moves.
Smith stayed among the top-50
for most of the race, registering a
10:17 split time at the 3,000-meter
mark.
"It was a one-and-done kind of
thing," Smith said of her final race
of the season. "I just really wanted
to end my season on a good note,
not a bad one. I just had that going

through my head the whole time."
Michigan didn't place any other
runners in the top 100, but did fin-
ish four more in scoring position.
Sophomore Rebecca Addison
was the second Wolverine to cross
the line, finishing in 117th place
with a time of 21:29.7. Tauro fin-
ished 10 seconds later in 139th
place with a time of 21:39.9.
"We know what we need to do
next year," McGuire said. "Today
was better than last year, but not
quite where we wanted it. If we
had gone out there closer to where
we've been all year, we would have

at least finished where we were
ranked, if not higher."
McGuire will now evaluate this
season and look to improve next
year, as all seven of the team's
top 6,000-meter runners will be
returning.
"We have to move forward,"
McGuire said. "We now have some
runners who gained some experi-
ence in this setting and they'll just
have to be more in control when we
come back next year. It can be an
intimidating venue if you let it, and
we have a couple people who are
definitely capable of doing better."

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. - Play-
ing on the same court once domi-
nated by Larry Bird, the Michigan
women's
basket- MICHIGAN 63
ball team INDIANA STATE 58
came into
Monday night's contest against
Indiana State looking to bring some
of Larry Legend's magic back.
With clutch shooting and defen-
sive stops down the stretch, the
Wolverines held onto beat the Syca-
mores, 63-58, in front of a rowdy
Indiana State crowd.
With the game tied at nine, the
Wolverines (2-2) went on a tear to
take a dominant 23-9 lead with just
^over 10 minutes remaining in the
-first half.
Sophomore forward Nya Jordan
:carried Michigan for the better part
-of the first 20minutes, scoringseven
of Michigan's first nine points.
"Nya is one of those kids that is
feast or famine, and tonight she was

feasting in the first half," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said after the
game. "She's our athlete, she can get
to the rim, and she made our first
two buckets and some great assists
as well.
"She had a great night."
But the Sycamores (2-2) respond-
ed to the Wolverines' run. Indiana
State began to establish itself both
inside and out, sparking a 14-6 run
to end the half. The Sycamores
shared the ball nicely, as four play-
ers had four points or more in the
first and no player had more than
six.
Michigan held on to a slim 29-25
lead heading into the locker room.
"I just don't think we are tough
enough and strong enough around
that basket defensively," Borseth
said. "We back off. I was and still
am pretty upset with that."
Less than three minutes into the
second half, the Wolverines' lead
was cut to just one. But Michigan
responded with 3-pointers by Jor-
dan, sophomore forward Rachel

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
Surrounded by groups of Okla-
homa, Florida State and Wiscon-
sin jerseys, only one maize block
'M' stood at the starting line.
Redshirt junior Craig Forys
was the sole Wolverine pres-
ent at the NCAA cross country
Championship meet on Monday,
held at the LaVern Gibson Cham-
pionship Course in Terre Haute,
Ind.
Last weekend, the Michi-
gan men's cross country team
failed to qualify for the national
championship meet, but Forys's
third-place finish at the NCAA
Great Lakes Regional on Nov. 13
earned him an individual bid.
Forys wrapped up his season
with a 113th-place individual
finish in the 10,000-meter event,
crossing the finish line with
a time of 31:18.10 - just eight
seconds shy of his personal-
best time, which he earned at
the 2008 NCAA Championship
meet.
This was his first champion-

ship since then, as he redshirted
last season due to knee and calf
injuries.
"Craig started out toward the
middle and was a little conser-
vative during the race today,"
Michigan coach Alex Gibby said
Monday. "He did a heck of a job
this season coming back from
an injury last year, but today he
kept it pretty conservative."
This was Forys's third appear-
ance at the NCAAs, as he ran
in the 2007 and 2008 races. In
2007, Forys finished 96th as a
freshman. He took 137th place
the next year.
"Although I'm pleased with
Craig's racing, it is frustrat-
ing that this was the first time
in eight years that we went to
NCAAs without a team," Gibby
said. "We really want to get
Michigan back there next year."
After a year in which they
fielded a very young team, Gibby
and the rest of the Wolverines
hope to improve next year.
"Craig was a main leader
this year and is definitely a role
model," Gibby said.

Kanye's My Beautiful Dark

anticipation was

before it struck. Ka West

tum as it surged
toward shore:
G.O.O.D Fridays, "Most disgusting
moment of my presidency," Matt
Lauer. Kanye knows how to stir
things up with natural disaster-like
efficiency, so it's hard to fathom
how his music can live up to the
larger-than-life personality behind
it. Well, it does and it doesn't.
Twisted Fantasy could very well
be the best thing Kanye has ever
done, and that's saying something,
considering his body of work. Every
track boils over with inspiration,
and even though there are six dif-
ferent guests on every song, the
album remains a distinctly indi-
vidual statement. 'Ye spits verses
alongside Jay-Z, Pusha T, Raekwon
and Rick Ross, and trades hooks
with Rihanna, Fergie and John
Legend. Yet it's ultimately the
Kanye show. Only Mr. West can go
toe-to-toe with such big names and
emerge the most compelling figure.
It's not even close.
But, of course, it's all by design.
You can hear it in the grandiosity of
each track: ideas piled upon ideas,
the concluding three minutes of
distorted, Auto-Tuned droning on

"Runaway," the "Hey, why not tack
on one more verse?" attitude. Every
track is so transparently the result
of Kanye trying to make the best
song of his career (and he just might
have succeeded with "Runaway").
You can almost hear him in his
Hawaiian studio: "Yeah, this one's
it, the hottest ever." But it's just so
Kanye of him to forget that there
can only be one best, that there's
just no room on one album for 1
"Runaway"s.
He's stubborn. You can't knock
him for trying, especially when he
came so damn close. Each track
could easily be your favorite Kanye
song, depending on the week, the
day, the season. "So Appalled" is
furious, and the beat is more of a
battlefield than a drum track. Swizz
Beatz's existential hook ("Middle
finger in the air, if you don't really
care / It's like that sometimes, man,
ridiculous / Life can be sometimes
ridiculous") is at first disconcert-
ing, then a novelty and then finally
an indispensable mantra. "Blame
Game" makes superb use of Aphex
Twin's "avril 14th" for the album's
closest thing to a ballad, and "Devil
in a New Dress" is just pure, soul-
sampling Kanye demonstrating his
mastery of the form.
As the title implies, the album is
an attempt to exorcise some of the
creator's demons - or, if not to exor-
cise, to speak in tongues for 13 tracks
and get them to reveal some sort of
truth. Kanye knows he's a "douche-
bag," an "asshole," a "scumbag." He's
trying to be a better person; it's just
that he doesn't know how to replace
his vices with virtue. "Hell of a Life"

Taken trom Kanye's "Men in Black II" audition.

plays on the Dark Fantasy (or is it
Beautiful?) of being married to a
porn star. He raps, biting the hook
from "Iron Man," "No more drugs
for me / Pussy and religion is all I
need." On "Runaway," he says "I
could have me a good girl /And still
be addicted to them hood rats /And
I just blame everything on you / At
least you know that's what I'm good
at." He can see the light, but he's not
quite sure if he can get there. And
even if he could, would he want to in
the first place?
In this way, Twisted Fantasy is
mired in conflict. There's an apoca-
lyptic exuberance running through-
out the album, a self-destructive
instinct to celebrate the good life in
the face of the knowledge that it'll
eventually kill. It's embodied in the
bald-faced excess that defines the
album; the same overindulgence

that makes each track a soaring
musical statement also works to
undermine its merit. Can we really
believe that the album is a product
of genuine artistic inspiration when
it's so consciously designed to be
better than anything else out there?
Or, more important: Does it matter
what the product's ends are when
the thing itself is this fucking good?
But, really, it's a hip-hop album.
The best of the year - maybe the
best of the last few. Questions of art
and intention mean nothing when
you're singing along, for the 40th
time, "And I always find / Yeah I
always find something wrong."
Because with Kanye, you can always
find something wrong. But where it
truly matters - lyrics, beats, origi-
nality, humanity - there's so much
right, and no one straddles the
divide as boldly as Kanye West.

Daily Arts Writer
Girl Talk has been making top-
40 pop safe for music snobs for
years, and on
his latest album
All Day, Greg
Gillis (the man
behind the stage Gui Talk
name) contin- All Day
ues his quest Illegal Art
of reinventing
party mainstays.
Gillis is adept at crafting deliri-
ously triumphant dance albums,
scouring other artists' works and
refashioning them into a brand-
new sound. On All Day, Gillis res-
cues long-forgotten songs from
the dark recesses of music history
and mixes them with previously
unlistenable pop and other, more
respected tracks. The result is a
hodgepodge of genres and guilty
pleasures. And this is probably
your only chance to hear Willow
Smith open for the Rolling Stones.
That should be all the incentive
needed.
To avoid the legal nightmare of
attempting to sell an album that
samples an entire spectrum of
other artists, Gillis sidestepped
the traditional album release and
made All Day available to down-
load for free via his label's web-
site - aptly titled Illegal Art. As
a testament to Girl Talk's under-
ground popularity (the album
was released unannounced), mil-
lions downloaded the album on
the first day. Although Gillis split
the album into separate tracks,
the label website instructs fans to
listen to the album in its entirety.
And honestly, it would be impos-
sible to completely break down
this album. On each track Gillis
samples from a large pool of art-
ists and masterfully mixes them
until it is impossible to distinguish
Lil Jon from Arcade Fire.
Girl Talk induces a unique gid-
diness. Album opener "Oh No"
will cause listeners to laugh at
the shock value and marvel at its
inventiveness. On the track, The

"As a college

said choir president and LSA

School of Nursing sophomore and

Chen added that the musical
selections and vocal technique
are at "a pretty high level for non-
music majors, which is what I was
going for."
Zeltzer said the Arts Chorale is
ideal for those who want to keep
their vocal music training alive
while concentrating in other aca-
demic areas.

How To Dougie" fame) is spliced
with alt-darling Jane's Addic-
tion. Gillis certainly has an ear
for bringing together artists that
are often genres and generations
apart (for instance, Iggy Pop and
the Beastie Boys share the same
track). It takes true skill to craft
an album that will cause both you
and your mom to be hit with diz-
zying waves of nostalgia.
"That's Right" pulls from per-
haps the most ragtag group of
artists on the album. It isn't often
Miley Cyrus, Nine Inch Nails and
Dr. Dre work together so harmo-
niously. Toward the beginning
of the track, contemporary adult
crooner Peter Gabriel's painfully
sappy "In Your Eyes" plays softly
as Foxy Brown sings "Guess who's
back?" And she's right; Gillis
polishes these washed-up stars
and makes them gleam for a
whole new generation.
AllDay is a pure party album,
and the seamless transitions -
the songs melt into each other
- suggest that there will be no
bathroom breaks until Gillis
says so. His playful song titles
reinforce the sweaty, joyous
attitude the album works to
convey. "This is the Remix" is

Beyond the 'Call of Duty'

A slew of new
features is nice,
but not essential
By SHIN HIEFTJE
For theDaily
To describe "Call of Duty: Black
Ops" succinctly: over-the-top.
From its explo-
sion-loving cam-*
paign mode to its
ludicrously in-C
depth multiplay- o
er to its mode Black Ops
wherein you fight Xbox 360,
off hordes of .. '0
zombies as John PS3,Wi,
F. Kennedy, "Call Nintendo
of Duty: Black DS and PC
Ops" has a lot of Actvision
wild things going
on.
First focus must be put on the
multiplayer, since it has been the
main draw of the series ever since
"Call of Duty 4" came out. "Black
Ops" offers a highly customized
play style, with a wealth of options
for weapon loadouts, "perks"
(helpful character traitslike quick-
er reloads or infinite sprint) and
rewards for kill streaks without
dying (including radar and attack
helicopters). The catch is that, like
previous iterations in the series,
very little of this customization is

available at the beginning, as most
abilities and weapons are locked
until you gain enough experience.
In order to get the best gear, per-
sistent play is required
To circumvent this grind, Act-
vision introduced a new concept,
"COD points." COD points serve
as a form of currency earned after
each match, which players use to
buy desired equipment or attach-
ments immediately. COD points
can also be used to buy and alter
cosmetic items, like a character's
personal emblem, gun camouflage
and more.
Further implementation of COD
points comes in the form of wager
matches. The top three players at
the end of the match gain more
points than they put in. Wager
matches are a neat addition to the
series and they comprise some of
the most fun and intense game
types included in "Black Ops." Of
course, there are also the classic
deathmatch and objective-based
modes.
Other multiplayer additions
include a theater mode to view
replays of your matches, a combat
training mode to play with A.I.
bots and the ability to play split-
screen online with a friend.
The abundance of options in the
multiplayer is noteworthy, but the
gameplay is what matters, and in
this regard "Black Ops" is fine, but
not outstanding. The same core

concept of aiming down sights and
shooting an opponent before he
can shoot you remains, the major
difference being that everyone
seems to die much quicker. Once
an enemy starts firing, you'll be
lucky to last longer than a second.
There's rarely a chance to return
fire or get to cover. In this way,
"Black Ops" is a game of situation-
al awareness more than anything.
While the gameplay remains tense
and engaging, multiplayer .fire-
fights just aren't that exciting since
they're just so short.
The campaign of "Black Ops"
has its ups and downs. Ina change
of pace from most shooters,
"Black Ops" takes place during
the Cold War, albeit a fictitious,
alternate version of it. Gamers
play the majority of the game as
Alex Mason, an operative for the
CIA who fights through various
countries associated with the
Cold War, from Cuba and Viet-
nam to Soviet Russia. All of these
missions usually involve accom-
plishing some sort of outlandish
feat, like taking out Fidel Castro,
stopping a Russian space launch
or blowing up the Viet Cong with
a helicopter.
Every mission is linear and very
scripted. Often, weapons put in
place for specific occasions are use-
less otherwise, and deviation from
the given path is discouraged. Still,
there's a pretty terrific amount of

variety in the campaign, though
this can be a mixed blessing. Some
missions feel monotonous and
repetitive, while others are smart-
ly designed and well paced. The
vehicle sections are particularly
exhilarating and explosive. The
single-player mode often seems
like it's trying too hard to blow
people away, but some parts are
genuinely quite cool.
Lastly, there is the "Zombies
mode," in which a player's job is
to defend an area from a horde of
zombies for as long as possible.
Once players beat the campaign,
they unlock a new pentagon level,
where they can play as John F.
Kennedy, Richard Nixon and even
Fidel Castro. While awesome in
theory, this mode is unfortunately
less entertaining than it sounds.
The rooms players can defend are
very small, there's no variety in
the zombies that come at you and
it lacks the expected feeling of
impending dread. It's a nice diver-
sion, but definitely not the draw of
the game.
Just like previous games in the
series, "Call of Duty: Black Ops"
has a solid single-player compo-
nent and a well thought out mul-
tiplayer system. "Black Ops" has a
ton of wild new things happening
in it, but none of them are execut-
ed so deftly that it feels like it's
advancing the series in any major
way.

FILM REVIEW
Russell Crowe stays in the
present in Next Three Days'

"Quick! Rebury it! Goddamn metal detector.'

ARTS CHORALE
From Page 7
want to learn this music, I want to
perform it, and I want to be part of
something."'
On a campus with no shortage of
vocal music groups, Zeltzer man-
aged to find his niche during his
sophomore year. Ever since, he has
blocked off Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons from 4to 6 p.m. for Arts
Chorale rehearsals.
"There are a lot of a cappella
groups, but they're small and hard
to get into. There's (Men's) Glee Club
and Women's Glee Club, but some-
times that's more of a time commit-
ment. Whilewe do have asignificant
amountoftime, it's alittlebitless, so
people that have busy schedules or
can't commit the time to Glee Club
or an a cappella group.can still con-
tinue their singing through Arts
Chorale," Zeltzer explained.
The repertoire of Arts Chorale
encompasses everything from
classical to contemporary pieces.
Tomorrow's concert will include
"Na Goruske, Na Gore," an obscure
traditional Russian piece arranged
by O.P. Kolovski, in the same lineup
as Ned Rorem's 1950s piece "From
an Unknown Past."

"My favorite piece is the Tal-
lis," Zeltzer said, referring to "Nine
Psalm Tunes for Archbishop Park-
er's Psalter" by Thomas Tallis.
"They're very solemn, very pious
and they have a lot of great harmo-
nies and quick a cappella pieces.
They're really easy to learn but we
also have to shape the phrases and
really put a lot of music into them,"
he added.
"I love the Brahms," Chen said.
"Brahms is one of my favorite com-
posers. There are a bunch of love
songs and they're so beautiful. It's
really fun to sing in different lan-
guages for me. I don't speak German
... but it's really cool to just be able to
sing it. We go over the meanings of
the songs and what we're trying to
portray as we're singing and per-
forming."
For both Chen and Zeltzer, the
diverse repertoire and familiar
atmosphere combine to make Arts
Chorale an unforgettable college
experience.
"I can come in here every Tues-
day and Thursday and find a group
of people that are always there ...
always having fun," Zeltzer said. "It
doesn't matter if you had an exam
that week or if you had nothing that
week, you still come in and have a
good time ... and that's why I keep
coming back."

In the wake of Paul Hag-
gis's highly successful ensemble
drama "Crash,"

ity of his artis-
tic vision has 11* Next
constantly come
into question. Three Days
Though his 2004 At Quality16
Oscar-winning and Rave
examination of Lionsgate
racial tensions
in Los Angeles
earned him dozens of awards
and widespread critical acclaim,
Haggis also drew significant
criticism from skeptics who
viewed the film as an overly sim-
plistic portrayal of an infinitely
complex problem.
It would seem that in light
of this criticism, Haggis errs
on the side of safety with "The
Next Three Days." The remake
of the 2007 French thriller "Pour
Elle" avoids all of the controver-
sial themes and bold risks of its
predecessor, and it resembles
something in the way of "Taken."
It's popcorn entertainment, but
damn good, considering how
little it invests in its characters
and plot.
The premise is simple, but
rarely explored: A young woman
(Elizabeth Banks, "Definitely,
Maybe") is accused of the mur-
der of her boss, but her professor
husband (Russell Crowe, "Robin
Hood") is convinced of her inno-
cence despite the considerable
evidence implicating her. He
orchestrates an intricate plan to
aid her escape from prison, and
the hitches in his scheme provide
for plenty of viewer tension.

"So I was thinking ... Me, you and that kiddie slide, five minutes."

Haggis proves adept at writing

a present-day role, one in which
we aren't expected to bow and
kiss the epic ground upon which
his sandaled feet have trod; it all
rests on pure chops here. He truly
is one of the greatest actors in the
world, and - though it may be a
small drop in the vast ocean of his
extensive filmography - this film
further advances that reputation.

to be sure, but film's dominance
