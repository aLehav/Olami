Martha 
Pollack, 
provost 

and executive vice president 
for academic affairs at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

has been appointed Cornell 
University’s 14th president, 
according to a Cornell press 
release 
published 
Monday 

afternoon.

Pollack has served as the 

University’s 
provost 
since 

2013, acting as the chief 
budgetary 
and 
academic 

officer overseeing all teaching 
and research in each of the 
University’s 19 schools and 
colleges. Her term at Cornell 
is slated to begin on April 

17, 2017, though her current 
contract, approved by the 
Board of Regents in December 
2014, extends through the 
summer of 2018.

“I am humbled and honored 

to 
have 
been 
elected 
to 

lead this great university,” 
Pollack said in the Cornell 
press release. “As a private 
university 
with 
a 
public 

mission, 
Cornell 
is 
the 

embodiment of my own deeply 
held belief in the ability of 
knowledge to improve the 
human condition.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

congratulated Pollack in an 
email sent to faculty Monday 
afternoon, and applauded her 

About 
300 
students 
and 

faculty gathered Monday night 
in the Diag for a group Isha 
prayers, or the fifth and final 
daily Islamic prayer, held by the 
University of Michigan Muslim 
Students’ Association following 
threats against Muslim women 
on campus this week.

On Friday night, a female 

student wearing a hijab was 
approached by a man who 
threatened to light her on fire 
if she did not remove her head 
covering. Another female student 
was approached by two men who 
referenced her religion, yelled at 
her for being in the United States 
and pushed her down a hill on 
Saturday night. Both crimes have 
been classified as intimidation 
crimes, with the latter classified 
as ethnic intimidation.

Also on Friday, a student 

found a swastika and hateful 
message written on the door of 
his apartment.

MSA President Farhan Ali, an 

LSA junior, said he was surprised 
by the large number of people 
who attended. He noted that to 
show solidarity with the female 
Muslim students on campus, 
male Muslims have been wearing 
the kufi, a traditional hat for 
Muslim men.

“People have these myths 

about Islam, and that’s how 
Islamophobia occurs,” Ali said. 
“We’re trying to figure out ways 
we can see to make this campus 

safer and we’re trying to talk to 
DPSS.”

University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
other 

administrators 
sent 
out 
an 

email Sunday night condemning 
incidents of intimidation and 
calling for unity on campus 
across political ideologies.

“We hope all members of 

our community can agree that 
we must not stand silent while 
facing expressions of bigotry, 

discrimination or hate that have 
become part of our national 
political 
discourse,” 
Schlissel 

wrote in the email.

The 
incidents 
follow 
the 

election of Donald Trump to 
the presidency on Nov. 8, who 
proposed a ban on all Muslim 
immigration 
during 
the 

campaign.

Organizers 
said 
Monday 

night’s 
gathering 
— 
which 

was open to Muslims and non-

Muslim allies of the organization 
— aimed to give voice to those 
in fear following the election, as 
well as to initiate unity among all 
students on campus.

Public Policy junior Stephen 

Wallace said he attended the 
event with other Black students 
to show solidarity with Muslims. 
Wallace said he would like to 
see further action from the 
University 
administration 
on 

More 
than 
100 
students, 

faculty 
members 
and 
Ann 

Arbor 
residents 
discussed 

tensions in the campus climate 
at the University of Michigan 
and elsewhere in the country 
following President-elect Donald 
Trump’s controversial victory at 
an LSA event Monday evening.

Since the election last Tuesday, 

students have held a number 
of protests and vigils on the 
University of Michigan’s campus 
to address fear and feelings 
of 
isolation 
from 
Trump’s 

rhetoric, which protestors have 
characterized as racially divisive 
and discriminatory. In the last 
three days, two hate crimes have 
occurred on campus according 
to crime alerts sent by the 
University of Michigan Division 
of Public Safety.

The event was hosted and 

moderated by LSA Dean Andrew 
Martin and several other LSA 
faculty members. Martin, who 
noted that the discussion was 
organized a month ago, said 
he believes much of the recent 
outrages can be attributed to

LGBTQ activist Tiq Milan speaks at the Transgender Awareness Week kickoff event at the Michigan Union Monday. 

At the University’s Transgender 

Awareness Week’s kickoff event 
Monday, keynote speaker Tiq Milan 
shared his story and encouraged 
resistance in the face of hate on 
campus and nationally.

The gathering, sponsored by the 

Spectrum Center, drew 60 students, 
faculty and community members 
filled the Kuenzel Room in the 
Michigan Union.

Milan, an LGBTQ advocate and 

writer, described his experiences 
as a Black transgender man, how 
his family reacted to his transition 
and how current events such as 

the rules aiming to control use of 
bathrooms by transgender people 
and the election of Donald Trump 
as president impact transgender 
people. Milan said his advocacy 
work is possible because he is 
comfortable with his identity and 
through this work he hopes to 
educate others about the variety 
within the trans experience.

“I’ll stand up here, talk about my 

surgeries and hormones and my 
mother and all these things so that 
other guys don’t have to, so other 
guys can just have the space to live 
their life,” he said.

Speaking specifically to recent 

instances of hate on campus, 
including ethnic intimidation and

Saturday 
night 
between 
9 

p.m. and 10 p.m., a student was 
approached near South University 
Avenue and Washtenaw Avenue by 
two men who yelled at her for being 
in America. They then referenced 
her religion and pushed her down 
a hill, according to the University of 
Michigan Division of Public Safety 
and Security.

A University crime alert sent out 

to students and faculty in an email 
Monday classified the incident 
as ethnic intimidation and urged 
students to look assertive and be 
aware of their surroundings.

 
When 
contacted 
Monday, 

University 
Police 
Department 

spokesperson Diane Brown had 
no 
additional 
information 
to 

provide and said the incident was 
being investigated by Ann Arbor 
Police Department. No additional 
information 
from 
AAPD 
was 

immediately available.

 This is the third reported 

incident of this nature on campus in 
the wake of last week’s presidential 
election. Friday, a female student 
was forced to remove her hijab and 
threatened she would be set on fire

Dynamic on and off the field 

and now online, linebacker Jabrill 

Peppers is in the spotlight of a 

popular parody Twitter account 

made by LSA sophomore Bennet 

Sakelaris.

The account was created in 

September this year, and has 

followed developments of the 

football team’s players throughout 

the season.

Sakelaris wrote in an email 

interview that the idea for the 

account began after a friend of 

his bought a pet fish and named it 

Jagill Peppers. After finding this 

amusing, Sakelaris started to play 

around with other puns related 

to Peppers, photoshop different 

memes and photos of Peppers and 

later on, add other University of 

Michigan football players into the 

mix as well.

 “Not too long ago I was 

walking down the spices aisle in 

Meijer and saw a jar of Turmeric 

and thought to myself ‘Oh 

Turmeric Magnuson might be 

a good one for Erik Magnuson,’ 

and surely it was,” Sakelaris 

wrote. “Sometimes people give 

me suggestions like just last week 

someone suggested Gerbil Peppers, 

which I was quite frankly shocked 

to have not thought of myself.”

The account has also followed 

the progression of player injuries, 

with puns to recognize when 

players get injured and return to 

play. After starting three games at 

cornerback, Jeremy Clark suffered 

a season-ending ACL tear that the 

account dubbed as the end of the 

“Lewis and Clark Expedition,” 

referring to Clark as well as Clark’s 

fellow cornerback Jourdan Lewis.

The account has gained 

recognition from at least one 

football player — Lewis. 

On National Taco Day, 

Sakelaris tweeted a video 

of lineman Taco Charlton, 

photoshopped with an actual 

taco, tackling opponents. On 

Election Day, the account endorsed 

“Franklin Delano Hill” for 

president.

Most recently, there was a 

tweet citing the loss at Iowa last 

weekend as a tough “Khalid Pill” 

to swallow, in reference to fullback 

Khalid Hill.

Sakelaris said he will continue 

to update the account daily, but 

will likely write less during the 

offseason.

AARON BAKER/Daily

LSA sophomore Sophia Leon, a candidate for LSA student government, delivers a speech 
at the LSA SG candidates’ forum Monday.

THE FORUM

The University of Michigan 

community and the Red Cross 
are collaborating to collect 
blood donations on campus as 
part of the 35th annual Blood 
Battle 
against 
Ohio 
State 

University.

For the annual Blood Battle, 

which began in 1982, the two 
rival schools — Michigan and 
OSU — aims to collect 2,500 
units of blood. This is roughly 
equivalent to 2,500 pints. The 
institution with higher units 
of donated blood wins the 
battle. 

In 
the 
last 
two 
Blood 

Battles, the University lost 
to OSU. Last year, the final 
score was 2,241 pints for the 
University and 2,529 pints for 
OSU. Currently, the University 

has 
collected 
1,466 
blood 

units, 60 percent of the 2,500-
unit goal. The battle ends on 
Nov. 23.

According to the American 

Red Cross, someone in the 
United States needs blood 
every two seconds, adding up 
to approximately 36,000 units 
of red blood cells needed every 
day. 38 percent of the U.S. 
population is eligible to donate 
blood, though just 5 percent of 
the eligible donors donate on a 
yearly basis.

LSA 
freshman 
Lauren 

Robisch, who was donating 
blood at a donation station 
today in the League, said her 
primary reason for donating 
blood is to help those in need.

“People don’t really realize 

the impact (donating blood) 
can 
make,” 
Robisch 
said. 

“I’m O negative, so I’m the 
universal blood type — I can 

make a difference in anybody’s 
life. And taking just a few 
minutes out of my day can 
save somebody, it means the 
world.”

Robisch 
added 
that 
she 

began to donate blood when 
she was 16 years old, which 
is the minimum age for blood 
donation, following in the 
footsteps of her mother.

LSA senior Laurel Fricker 

noted that since blood is made 
of three different parts — red 
blood cells, platelet and plasma 
— one unit of donated blood 
can potentially save three 
people. Fricker is the president 
of Blood Drives United, a 
student group that focuses 
on organizing blood drives 
on campus and educating the 
community about the benefits 
of blood donation.

Erin 
Burns, 
account 

manager at Ann Arbor’s Red 
Cross, said how well the 
University does at the Blood 
Battle in a particular year 
might be related to how the 
football team does in the same 
year, given the University and 
OSU’s long history of football 
rivalry.

“I think football dictates 

a lot of the excitement that 
revolves around (the Blood 
Battle),” 
Burns 
said. 
“The 

rivalry 
between 
the 
two 

schools 
does 
stem 
from 

football. 
Three 
years 
ago, 

when we did win, the football 
team was doing well, so people 
still thought there was chance 
of winning.”

Both Fricker and Burns 

were hopeful that since the 
University football team is 
having a successful season 
so far compared to previous 
years, it would be reflected 
in the number of blood units 
collected for this year’s Blood 
Battle.

didn’t

accomplishments as provost.

“Our loss is most certainly 

Cornell’s gain,” he wrote.

In a University statement, 

Schlissel also said he will 
appoint an interim provost 
before the end of Fall semester, 
and organize a nationwide 
search 
for 
a 
permanent 

replacement by January.

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald said while 
the announcement came as a 
surprise to many University 
officials, 
he 
believes 
her 

appointment 
was 
a 
good 

decision for Cornell.

“She’s been a strong leader 

for academics and for the 
budget.” Fitzgerald said. “The 
provost at the University of 
Michigan 
has 
a 
somewhat 

unique role where the chief 
academic officer is also the 
chief budget officer. She 
balances 
her 
commitment 

to academics with being a 
good steward of the budget 
well, while keeping a college 
education 
affordable 
and 

blazing pathways with new 
academic initiatives. That’s 
quite a sweetspot.”

 
Cornell’s 
board 
of 

trustees 
unanimously 

approved Pollack’s selection 
Monday 
afternoon 
on 
a 

recommendation 
from 
the 

school’s 
presidential 
search 

committee, formed in April 
following the death of former 
Cornell president Elizabeth 
Garrett. 
Before 
Pollack’s 

appointment as provost at the 
University, she served as the 
associate chair for computer 
science and engineering in 
the University’s department 

of electrical engineering and 
computer 
science, 
as 
well 

as the dean of the School of 
Information.

In an interview with the 

Cornell Daily Sun, Pollack who 
will be Cornell’s second female 
president in its 184 years 
of existence, noted that the 
importance of her new job will 
transcend gender lines.

“The job of the president is 

to serve everyone. Not to be 

the female president, but the 
president.” Pollack said.

During her tenure at the 

University, Pollack has been 
an advocate for technological 
innovation and the use of 
data in the classroom. In 
a 
press 
release 
from 
the 

University 
in 
September 

2015, Pollack emphasized the 
importance of a $100 million 
University 
investment 
in 

data science, calling it the 
future of academia. Among 
other impacts, the investment 
created the Michigan Institute 
for Data Science.

“Data science has become a 

fourth approach to scientific 
discovery, 
in 
addition 
to 

experimentation, 
modeling 

and 
computation,” 
Pollack 

said. “To spur innovation while 
providing focus, the DSI will 
launch challenge initiatives in 
four critical interdisciplinary 
areas that build on our existing 
strengths 
in 
transportation 

research, 
health 
sciences, 

learning analytics and social 
science research.”

Also 
during 
her 
tenure, 

Pollack helped to spearhead 
the University’s Third Century 
Initiative, a plan to invest $50 
million dollars over five years 
in an effort to improve student 
learning. The initiative, which 
awards 
grant 
funding 
to 

University faculty, has helped 
to foster University-developed 
programs, such as School of 
Information professor Barry 
Fishman’s grading platform, 
Gradecraft.

Fitzgerald 
noted 
these 

initiatives will remain intact 
following her departure.

“At this point, the things that 

Provost Pollack has introduced 
have 
become 
significant 

University 
commitments.” 

Fitzgerald said. “They are 
moving forward, and I don’t 
see there being an interruption 
with an interim leader, or a 
leadership change.”

Pollack’s departure follows 

a 
pattern 
similar 
to 
her 

predecessor, 
Phil 
Hanlon, 

who also left his post at the 
University 
to 
assume 
the 

presidency 
of 
Dartmouth 

College.

threatening behavior, as well as 
the present political climate in 
the United States, he encouraged 
students to resist.

“I don’t have the answers and 

it’s killing me,” Milan said. “I don’t 
know what to say. All I can tell you 
to do is to resist. Resistance looks 
a lot of different ways. Sometimes 
resistance looks like organizing 
your 
people 
and 
fighting 
… 

Sometimes resistance is taking a 
step back and saying I don’t have to 
fight, I don’t have to do this.”

Spectrum Center Director Will 

Sherry said Trans Awareness 
week has existed for at least the 
nine years he has worked at center 
noting it was well established at 
the time he joined. Though he 
has noticed changes throughout 
the existence of Trans Awareness 
Week, Sherry said overall he 
appreciates the consistency of 
support the week offers to students 
who often feel marginalized.

“It’s an opportunity for people 

who share non-binary and trans 
identities, to come together and 
be in a community that can often 
feel small and come together in 
spaces where you don’t feel so 
small,” he said. “That’s something 
I really appreciate personally and 
professionally about the week.”

LSA 
senior 
Felix 
Boratyn, 

co-chair 
of 
the 
student 

organization TransForm, which 
conducts activist and support 
work for transgender students on 
campus and helped organize the 
week, said Milan’s perspective on 
resistance resonated with him. He 

added that the election has made 
this week even more meaningful.

“This 
week 
has 
definitely 

become more important to me,” 
Boratyn said. “A lot of people are 
mourning right now the results 
of the election and knowing what 
those results are going to mean for 
a lot of people. Part of trans week is 
celebration but part of trans week 
is mourning trans women who 
have died and violence towards 
trans people, a combination of 
everything.”

LSA 
senior 
Ini 
Ubong, 

co-chair of TransForm, said they 
appreciated Milan’s discussion of 
how he defines his masculinity, 
and think it is a message of hope 
for other transgender students.

“It’s uplifting to hear he did it, 

he got here, to a point where he 
can come and be a speaker at our 
school so there’s still kind of hope, 
I guess,” they said. “It brings a 
message of hope and a feeling that 
I’m not alone in the way that I feel.”

Ubong said Trans Awareness 

Week aims to both support 
transgender students and educate 
non-transgender 
students, 

especially in light of the high 
number of murders of transgender 
women in 2016. To date, 20 
transgender indviduals have been 
murdered in the United States 
according to the Human Rights 
Campaign.

“My hope is that it brings the 

trans community together and 
also it provides education for other 
people,” Ubong said. “My hope for 
Trans Awareness Week is that we 
focus on the transgender people 
that are most marginalized, I think 
that’s transgender Black women.”

alt-right 
posters 
which 
have 

been 
posted 
around 
campus 

intermittently since earlier this fall, 
targeting Muslim, Black, LGBTQ 
and 
female 
students. 
Posters 

promoting white supremacy and 
calling for students to report 
undocumented immigrants were 
found on campus early Monday 
morning, alongside phrases such as 
“Make America Great Again.”

“We’re 
here 
for 
(Muslims) 

as a fellow minority, another 
marginalized group of people,” 
Wallace 
said. 
“I 
hope 
that 

President Schlissel does address 
the hateful flyers that have been 
posted up. I think that more needs 
to be done to investigate who 
is posting these flyers, because 
people have been posting these 
going back to September … and it 
seems like nothing is being done to 
stop them.”

Over the past week, many in 

the University community have 
responded to the election by 
hosting and attending vigils and 
protests. A unity march with 
hundreds of Ann Arbor families 
also occurred Sunday afternoon, 
aiming to promote peace and 
support for all communities.

LSA sophomore Rami Ebrahim, 

social justice and activism chair 

for MSA who helped organize the 
prayer gathering, said he hopes 
to see further action from the 
administration aside from crime 
reports and emails, such as specific 
safety initiatives.

“There’s a tense climate on 

campus, especially for Muslim 
students, and especially for more 
identifiable Muslim students — 
especially the women,” Ebrahim 
said. “We wanted to show that … 
some of the things happening on 
campus are not representative 
of the student body or are 
representative of all of the country 
in general.” 

LSA junior Yara Gayar, another 

attendee at the event, took a slightly 
different position, saying she was 
happy with the diverse turnout 
of students and members of the 
community at Monday’s event, 
and with administrative response 
following the election.

“I like that professors are 

addressing the students’ safety and 
respect of differences,” Gayar said. 
 

Much like Ali, LSA junior Hina 

Jaffer stressed the significance of 
the event in building new alliances.

“The 
silver 
lining 
to 
this 

whole thing is that, all of these 
marginalized communities have 
come together and built all these 
alliances that otherwise weren’t 
really strong, weren’t really there,” 
Jaffer said.

if she did not comply. In a second 
incident over the weekend, a student 
left his apartment to go to class and 
came home to a swastika drawn on 
his apartment door. 

 The Rock was also discovered 

painted with “Fuck America” and 
“Kill them All” over drawings of the 
Republican and Democratic Party 
logos last week.

 Ethnic intimidation, which is a 

felony offense and often refered to as 
a hate crime, is defined by Michigan 
law as “specific intent to intimidate 
or harass another person because 
of that person’s race, color, religion, 
gender or national origin, and does 
any of the following: causes physical 
contact with another person; or 
damages, destroys or defaces any 
real or personal property of another 
person.” 

 Multiple administrators across 

campus, 
as 
well 
as 
students, 

condemned the first incident on 
Friday 
through 
messages 
and 

events over the weekend and urged 
students to support one another.

 Students gathered Saturday to 

protest the incident and express 
solidarity with students who have 
experienced anything similar.

 On Sunday, President Mark 

Schlissel wrote an email to the 
student body condemning hate 
crimes and hate speech. He also 
outlined resources for students who 
have experienced incidents such as 
these.

 University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald said the investigation 
is ongoing, and refered back to the 
email Schlissel sent out Sunday.

 “Emotions are high all across 

the political spectrum. We hope all 
members of our community can 
agree that we must not stand silent 
while facing expressions of bigotry, 
discrimination or hate that have 
become part of our national political 
discourse,” the email read. “Only 
by speaking out against personal 
attacks, hate and threats can we 
move on to have the discussions that 
will be necessary for our campus and 
our nation to reach its full potential.”

year I think we are seeing a 
little bit more of the renewed 
excitement.”

Fricker added that a tweet 

from Michigan football coach

about

Blood Battle had helped the

BDU has also tried many 

different advertising methods, 

such

awareness 
about 
the 
event 

in an email to the University 
community. In addition, BDU 
is also rewarding the donors 
to encourage the community 
to donate blood. This year, all 
donors will get a Red Cross 
T-shirt and restaurant coupons 
like a buy-one-get-one free 
Chipotle coupon, as well as 
entering to win raffle prizes.

surprise at Trump’s victory.

“At the time, nearly everyone 

thought 
Secretary 
Clinton 

would win the election,” he said 
during the discussion. “Just 
about every political pundit on 
the left and right agreed. Many 
members of our community had 
a difficult time getting back to 
the classroom and back to work 
after the loss. Many members of 
our community continue to feel 
unsafe on our own campus.”

Martin 
also 
emphasized 

that the dialogue was designed 
to welcome all people who 
have 
expressed 
feelings 
of 

marginalization in recent days, 
not just those who supported 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton.

On Monday, a petition started 

by LSA sophomore Amanda 
Delekta circulated and garnered 
over 300 signatures. The petition 
condemned the administration 
and 
students’ 
responses 
to 

President-elect Donald Trump’s 
election.

“A lot of you as Trump 

supporters feel that you have 
been ignored at best, or swarmed 
at worst,” Martin said. “Some of 
you have been verbally assaulted 
or attacked, and I know that 
some of you feel the institution 
has not lived up to the ideals of 
open debate, and felt that you do 
not have a home on this campus 
either.”

After 
Martin’s 
remarks, 

members 
of 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 

highlighted 
their 
office’s 

increased 
accessibility 
in 

response to the contentious 
election results.

Speaking to the crowd, CAPS 

Director Todd Sevig promoted a 
variety of approaches to achieving 
calm and comfort. In the leadup 
to the election season, CAPS 
organized an exhibit reminding 
students to care for themselves 
amid the stress of classes and the 
election.

“It’s important to note that 

the election has taken a toll 
psychologically,” 
Sevig 
said. 

“We are not here to say that if 
you are feeling strong emotions, 
then you need therapy. We are 
here to say that things that could 
be therapeutic and healing is 
important. There is no one way of 
coping or making sense of this is 
going to work for all of us.”

Following 
the 
remarks 
by 

Martin and CAPS personnel, the 
room was divided into smaller 
groups for discussion. At each 
table, an LSA faculty member 
moderated the discourse, asking 
questions and maintaining a calm 
tone. Participants were reminded 
to criticize ideas, not people.

After nearly 10 minutes of 

discussion, 
the 
large 
room 

reconvened to shared publicly 
what had been discussed in smaller 
groups. A microphone was passed 
around the room for the next hour, 
during which personal reactions 
and general commentary were 
shared in response to the election 
results last week.

Human rights: not just an issue abroad

ADITHI REDDI | OP-ED

L

ook at the person sitting 
next to you. Who are 
they? 
You 
question 

yourself: Are they different from 
you because of some physicality, 
some accent, or maybe they are 
just like you 
— human. That 

person might not be treated with 
the same respect and freedom as 
you. The year of 2016 has seen its 
fair share of human mistreatment 
— not just physically, but even 
verbally, considering our new 
president, Donald Trump, set 
his campaign platform on the 
misrepresentation 
of 
various 

minority groups. I can also say 
this as a student at the University 
of Michigan since I have seen the 
racist statements made about the 
Black and Muslim communities 
on campus.

On Oct. 11, Kathryn Sikkink, 

the Ryan family professor of 
human rights policy at the 
Harvard Kennedy School, spoke 
at the University, discussing 
the human rights retrogression 
in 
which 
certain 
areas 
of 

human 
rights 
violations 
are 

suffering 
more 
than 
others. 

Disappointingly, 
Ms. 
Sikkink 

focused more on developing 
countries such as Syria and 
Rwanda, 
whose 
governments 

commit human rights violations 
than on developed countries that 
commit such violations as well 
— including the United States 
and its lack of human sensitivity 
or empathy, which I attribute 
to post-9/11 paranoia. There is 
not enough focus on developed 
nations committing human rights 
violations even though their 
governments 
blatantly 
carry 

them out.

The United States is not the 

angelic nation of equal human 
rights that it is made out to 
be. If that were true, Amnesty 
International would not have 
urged President Obama to close 
Guantanamo Bay or even stop 
the arms supply to countries 

committing the human rights 
violations. One prisoner was 
held at Gitmo for 14 years 
without 
coviction. 
Further, 

some claim these prisoners have 
never been convicted because 
Congress has prohibited the 
White House from financing the 
trials of these prisoners.

While 
Obama 
issued 
an 

executive order back in 2009 
directing that the prison be 
shut down within one year, the 
question of when it will actually 
close remains open. Though some 
or many of these prisoners could 
hold vital information about 
terrorism, the torture they endure 
can never be justified as humane. 
In the initial chapters of “Human 
Rights in World History,” Peter 
Stearns 
discusses 
the 
U.S. 

intervention in the Middle East 
after 9/11 and questions whether 
the 
interrogation 
tactic 
and 

prisoner treatment of suspects 
violates the Geneva Code. This 
is one human physically and 
emotionally attacking another 
human to receive information. 
Such coercion leads to torture 
and therefore should never be 
justified.

No matter what the suspected 

human being has done, how 
can you sit back in your chair 
and not even question their 
innocence? While the United 
States continues to keep these 
prisoners indefinitely — some of 
whom might be innocent — in 
what is considered the gutter of 
all prisons, the U.S. government 
continues to supply weapons 
to the Egyptian, Israeli, Saudi 
Arabian 
and 
other 
Middle 

Eastern governments.

In 
another 
Time 
article, 

Jared Malsin writes about how 
the 
Saudi 
Arabian 
military 

coalition has killed an estimated 
10,000 Yemenis since the start 
of their intervention in Yemen 
in March 2015 using the $20 
billion arms deal they signed 

with the United States the same 
year. However, while the United 
States is monetarily backing 
countries with little regard for 
human rights, the White House 
administration 
continues 
to 

state that they have had “serious 
concerns about the conflict in 
Yemen and how it has been 
waged.” This shows that the 
United States has also waged 
this war simply by supplying the 
weapons.

The focus of the American 

government 
and 
military 

cannot solely rely on extracting 
information to make the world 
a safer place. The government 
cannot 
strategize 
how 
to 

achieve its stated goals without 
considering how they treat the 
human beings. As individuals 
seek 
to 
educate 
themselves 

on current events, they must 
not look at a problem as solely 
happening in “another” part of 
the world. People must remember 
that the United States is a 
problem in foreign relations and 
the preservation of human rights, 
as exemplified in our country’s 
actions 
surrounding 
Gitmo. 

People living in this country must 
acknowledge its flaws.

So look back at that person 

next to you. Have they been 
denied basic human rights as a 
direct or indirect result of the 
United States’ actions? With 
Donald Trump holding executive 
decision, the person next to you 
and many others like him or 
her could possibly lose a chance 
to use and vocalize their basic 
rights when necessary. Hold 
this country accountable for 
selectively choosing who joins 
the melting pot of the United 
States and selectively choosing 
who should receive what rights 
and when. Every human right 
should be a fixed one, not a 
conditional one.

We are not defeated

MELISSA STRAUSS | COLUMN

E

arly 
last 
Tuesday 

morning, I woke up at the 
crack of dawn, walked 

the five minutes from my house 
to Angell Elementary School 
and eagerly hopped in line to 
vote in my very first presidential 
election. I was giddy at the 
prospect of finally getting the 
chance to not only 
perform my civic duty, 
but also to cast my vote 
for the first female 
presidential nominee 
in our nation’s history. 
Afterward, I displayed 
my “I Voted” sticker 
on my shirt with a 
sense 
of 
immense 

pride. I spent the rest 
of the day a bundle 
of 
nervous 
energy, 

but unequivocally hopeful and 
excited for my country’s future.

Later in the evening, as I 

watched the numbers roll in 
on CNN’s numerous screened 
walls, my elation from earlier in 
the day began to wane. As Wolf 
Blitzer frantically flitted across 
the room reporting Florida, Ohio, 
Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin, 
Pennsylvania and even New 
Hampshire as too close to call, I 
grew wary. As I saw the polling 
data from The New York Times 
and FiveThirtyEight slowly take 
her chance of winning from 
around 70 percent down to less 
than 30 percent, I was overcome 
with dread. And then they 
called Florida. And Ohio. And 
Pennsylvania. And Wisconsin. 
And most likely, Michigan. All 
in his favor. I felt a combination 
of soul-crushing devastation and 
paralyzing fear I never imagined 
I would experience in my lifetime.

When my dad called me late 

Tuesday night, I couldn’t hold 
back my grief. I cried real, gut-
wrenching tears I didn’t know 
I could muster in response to a 
political election. He comforted 
me, telling me again and again 
that I would be fine, my family 
would be fine. But I wasn’t crying 
just for myself. Despite the fact 
that I am a woman, I am a white, 
educated, middle-class person 
whose life will most likely not 
significantly change in the next 
four years.

But so many millions of people 

in this country may not be fine. 
I cried for the Muslims in this 
country — built on freedom of 
religion — who are terrified they 
will be banned for their faith. I 

cried for the immigrants who 
helped build this country who 
don’t know whether to pack their 
bags now or hope they won’t be 
deported. I cried for the LGBTQ 
community 
who 
must 
now 

endure a vice president-elect 
who has advocated for increased 
funding to “institutions which 

provide 
assistance 

to those seeking to 
change their sexual 
behavior,” otherwise 
known as conversion 
therapy, to cure their 
supposed 
moral 

wrongs. I cried for 
the women in this 
country 
— 
myself 

included — who have 
been told that even if 
you rise to the highest 

ranks of your profession, you will 
still be beaten out by a man with 
fewer (or no) credentials for the 
job. And I cried for the half of this 
country that is so unhappy with 
our system of government that 
they felt the need to overhaul it 
completely by voting for the new 
president-elect.

And yet, I realize my empathy 

is not enough. Writing this article 
and speaking with my other 
privileged friends is not enough. 
Posting messages of solidarity 
on Facebook and Twitter and 
Instagram is not enough. 

While it is true that we must 

come to terms with a president-
elect many of us so vehemently 
opposed, we do not have to 
accept the bigotry, violence and 
hatred that has erupted in the 
wake of his victory. Things such 
as “daily lynching calendars” at 
the University of Pennsylvania, 
swastika graffiti on numerous 
storefronts nationwide and also 
the Muslim student forced to 
remove her hijab at the threat 
of being set aflame on this 
very campus are completely, 
incontrovertibly 
unacceptable. 

We — especially those of us who 
are privileged enough not to face 
prejudice and intolerance on a 
daily basis — must not fall silent. 
We must join in the protests, 
stand up as allies and hold each 
other accountable for our actions. 
Failing to act is an act in and of 
itself. Complacency is acceptance.

Looking around campus on 

Wednesday and speaking with 
a number of students, I realize 
many people share my pain. 
This has been a difficult pill to 
swallow for so many of us at 

this university. Ninety percent 
of 
votes 
from 
student-heavy 

precincts in Ann Arbor were 
against the winning candidate. 
But despite all of this, if we also 
lose our faith in humanity, we 
let them win all over again. The 
messages chalked on Wednesday 
throughout the Diag of “You 
Belong Here,” “You Are Loved,” 
“You Matter” and more reminded 
me that there is still so much good 
in this country. We must work 
together to fix the major social, 
economic and political problems 
that led half of our country to vote 
against the system. We must work 
together to guarantee the safety 
and freedoms of all Americans 
— 
white, 
Black, 
immigrant, 

Christian, Muslim, Jewish, gay, 
straight, trans, young, old and 
every single person far and in 
between — because these people 
are the very foundation upon 
which our nation stands.

It may seem like there is 

nothing we can do now, but I 
assure you this is far from the 
truth. Action starts today. Tell 
someone you love them. Take a 
look around and find the beauty 
in this world because there 
is still so much of it. Stand up 
for all of those facing growing 
marginalization and suffering 
from despicable acts of hatred 
we have seen increase in the 
past few days. Participate in 
protests and sign petitions. Write 
letters to your representatives. 
Regardless of their side of the 
aisle, remind them of your values, 
your priorities and that they 
represent you. Take action for 
social change, whether that be 
by donating to an organization, 
joining a campaign, participating 
in a movement or anything else 
that drives a cause you care 
about. Think critically about 
blindly following party lines. 
Though they seem a lifetime 
away now, midterm elections take 
place in two years. Think about 
your personal values and how to 
pick candidates — on either side 
— that actually represent these 
values. And finally, find your 
passion and pursue it vigorously. 
We all have so much to offer, and 
together we can work for a better 
tomorrow.

Today we are afraid. Today we 

are hurt. But today and every day, 
we are not defeated.

Now is not the time for BDS

JESSE ARM | OP-ED

A

round this time a year 
ago, the Daily, as well as 
many other publications 

throughout the country, covered 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Central Student Government’s 
first-ever 
Ethics 
Committee 

investigation. It was a probe to 
determine if I, an elected member 
of CSG at the time, was guilty of 
committing an unprecedented 
ethical violation because of my 
public and civil condemnation 
of an anti-Israel apartheid wall 
erected on campus.

Eventually, I was vindicated 

of any wrongdoing after a 
long, 
stressful 
process 
that 

included numerous threats and 
harassments by classmates and 
online trolls that went on for 
weeks after the investigation 
ended. 
Because 
of 
this 

horrifically negative experience 
and the unwanted attention paid 
to me in both the CSG weekly 
agenda and in The Michigan 
Daily, I have refrained from 
writing about my experience 
or matters pertinent to this 
subject. Today, I no longer feel I 
can remain silent.

On the night of Tuesday, Nov. 

15, CSG will vote on a measure 
dealing 
with 
the 
proposed 

imposition 
of 
boycotts, 

divestment 
and 
sanctions 

against Israel, and Israel alone. 
This legislation is being brought 
forth by the same student 
organization that led the failed 
effort demanding my removal 
from the assembly, Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equality. 
This political organization has 
brought forth what I believe 
to be immoral legislation. The 
resolution is not an accurate 
representation of the University 
student population’s views on 
human rights violations, but is 
merely packaged and presented 
as such. In reality, it is a position 
offering only one narrative in 
the incredibly complex Arab-
Israeli conflict, chock-full of 
regressive solutions that will 
only 
impede 
dialogue 
and 

aggravate tensions.

It has been a difficult few 

weeks 
and 
months 
leading 

up to the proposition of this 

boycott declaration. Following 
the 2016 election cycle, there 
has been a deplorable uptick in 
Islamophobia, 
anti-Semitism 

and other hateful rhetoric that 
brings toxicity to this campus and 
across our nation. However, the 
University’s student government 
is attempting to place all the blame 
for a continuing Israeli presence 
in the West Bank on Israel, 
without any acknowledgement of 
Palestinian leadership’s rejection 
of Israeli peace proposals. Had 
they 
been 
considered, 
these 

proposals would have brought an 
end to the alleged occupation on 
at least three separate occasions 
(1967, 2001 and 2007). For CSG 
to impose a boycott on the nation 
state of the Jewish people at this 
juncture in history, without any 
suggestion of boycotting those 
who have rejected peace time and 
again, is immoral and a targeted 
attack on the Jewish people.

Israel holds a special place 

in my heart as the ancestral 
homeland of my long-displaced, 
nomadic people. All Jews share 
this historical connection to 
the land of Israel. But even 
if we set history and the 
well-documented, 
unbroken 

3,000-year-old 
Jewish 

presence in the land of Israel 
aside, Israel today is a beacon 
of liberalism, freedom and 
democracy.

Arab citizens in Israel, both 

men and women, have rights 
unparalleled to most places 
in the world. They serve in 
the national legislature, the 
Supreme Court, in academia, 
business, 
medicine, 
law 

and in virtually every other 
professional 
sphere. 
Israel’s 

record on rights for women 
and LGBTQ people is among 
the most progressive in the 
world. The nation’s ability 
to 
keep 
civilian 
casualties 

low throughout its history, 
despite wars with enemies 
who 
hide 
their 
soldiers 

behind their citizenry, is also 
unprecedented. 
And 
most 

critically, any Arab or other 
citizen of Israel is free to take 
up any grievance he or she has 
with his or her government 

or larger society in the courts 
or in the international media, 
because the right to access 
the courts and speech are 
unabridged in Israel. These 
are 
liberties 
that 
not 
as 

widely held in the rest of the 
Middle East and across much 
of the world at large. When a 
boycott movement is targeted 
exclusively at the world’s sole 
Jewish nation, a nation with an 
incomparable commitment to 
the protection of human rights, 
one must consider the prospect 
of bigotry at play.

Equally important, a boycott 

of Israel would irrevocably 
damage the lives of Palestinian 
workers who rely on Israeli 
firms for economic sustenance 
(in the West Bank and in Israel 
proper). It would damage the 
lives of all citizens across the 
globe who enjoy the benefits 
of Israeli technological and 
medical 
innovation. 
And 
it 

would damage the lives of 
Muslims, Christians and Jews 
who rely on the state of Israel 
for 
protection 
from 
radical 

terrorist 
groups 
seeking 
as 

much bloodshed as possible.

Now is not the time to focus 

our attention away from what 
is happening on our campus, 
in our country and in other 
corners of the world where 
real injustice, bigotry and even 
genocide is occurring. Now is 
not the time to overemphasize 
flaws and promulgate lies about 
the world’s sole Jewish nation. 
Now is not the time to propel 
a BDS movement endorsed 
by 
terrorist 
sympathizers, 

Holocaust deniers and noted 
bigots like David Duke, former 
Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard, 
according to The Algemeiner 
and 
Israel 
National 
News, 

respectively. Now is not the 
time for capitulation to clear 
double standards. Now is not 
the time for further division 
within our deeply fractured 
nation and campus. Now is not 
the time for BDS.

“Skyrim” is a video game of 

profound influence. It’s one of 
those names, like “Mario” or 
“Zelda,” 
that 

everybody 
seems to know. 
My non-gamer 
girlfriend says, 
when 
people 

ask, 
that 
she 

“doesn’t 
play, 

but played ‘Sky-
rim’ for a little 
bit once.” To say 
it’s broken into 
the mainstream 
would be a mas-
sive understatement — it’s one 
of the top 20 best-selling games 
of all time, at over 20 million 
units sold.

And it’s not just a commercial 

success. At an unheard-of 96 on 
Metacritic, it’s one of the most 
acclaimed video games ever. 
Last week, the game’s publisher 
re-released the game on cur-
rent-gen consoles with a graphi-
cal update, and bundled the 
base game with all of its DLC.

I was going to review “Sky-

rim Special Edition” just like 
any other release. But what’s the 
point of me regurgitating praise 
for a game that’s already been 
lavished by every major gaming 
and non-gaming publication on 
the planet? You heard the opin-
ions of the games press back in 
2011, and I agree with them. It’s 
an extraordinarily ambitious 
open-world role-playing game. 
The overarching story is com-
petent, but the sense of explo-
ration and world building are 
masterful. The music is heart-
meltingly beautiful. The graph-
ics were unreal at the time. 
There’s a truly absurd amount 
of content to engage with. By 
any measure, “Skyrim” is a mas-
terpiece.

But you know that already. 

My critical opinion of the game 
doesn’t matter at this point. 
Instead, I want you to consider 
the opinion of my roommate, 
LSA Senior Matt Kotrba.

I’ve known Matt for four 

years and lived with him for 
three, and I can safely say that 
“Skyrim” is the only video game 
I’ve ever seen him play more 
than once. In fact, he plays it all 
the time — and he’s been devour-
ing the remaster since Bethesda 
sent me a copy. He would never 
self-label as a gamer, and he 
never seems interested in the 
many games I buy that he could 

easily play for free. Matt rep-
resents one of the many mil-
lion mainstream purchasers of 
“Skyrim” — the guy who doesn’t 
read the trade sites, or listen to 
any gaming podcasts. He’s just 

an average guy who 
fell in love with 
“Skyrim.”

“It had to be dur-

ing junior or sopho-
more year of high 
school,” 
he 
said. 

“Back when every-
one 
else 
started 

playing it. Everyone 
was talking about 
it at school, but I 
didn’t get it until a 
year after that.”

Matt said his friend Jamie 

Brandon was the first to turn 
him on to it.

“One of my friends from high 

school just had the game on,” 
Matt said. “It was like, ‘here, 
you need to see this, ‘cause it’s 
so good.’ And she pretty much 
just forced me to start a profile 
and start playing. She played 
a lot more games, but I never 
played really anything at all. 
We had like, PlayStation 1 and 
all that for my brothers growing 
up, but I never played any of the 
games. They just never seemed 
interesting.”

I sat on the couch perpen-

dicular to him as he booted up 
the game from the PS4 menu 
and buttoned through the start 
screen. I noticed that for what-
ever reason, everything was in 
French.

“Actually, it’s really helped 

me in practicing French. I’m 
trying to learn it, and this is 
perfect because it’s as if I’m 
going to France,” Matt said. 
“Everybody’s speaking French 
to me, I’m going to towns and 
French vendors and guards and 
people are talking to me. And 
you respond with questions and 
stuff. It’s good ‘cause you read 
and listen and hear and talk.”

The North American version 

of “Skyrim” includes language 
options for English, French, 
Spanish, Italian and German.

“Just look at this — it’s beau-

tiful!” Matt said, as his charac-
ter peered over a ledge at the 
rising in-game sun. “I mean… 
it’s different from other games, 
I guess, like you don’t go into 
it thinking ‘okay, I’m gonna do 
these things to beat this part of 
this game.’ You can just enter it 
thinking ‘okay, cool, I’m gonna 
see some cool shit, do some cool 
stuff, and we’ll see if we can run 
into people and learn about sto-

rylines.’ It’s like a folk tale or 
something.”

Matt said he’s beaten the 

game a couple times. “I just 
keep going back as different 
characters,” he said.

Over the years, I’ve attempt-

ed to get Matt into games that 
are similar in genre to Skyrim, 
maybe so I could have another 
gamer around the house. I made 
Matt sit down and try “Far Cry 
4,” “The Witcher 3” and even 
Bethesda’s follow-up to “Sky-
rim,” “Fallout 4.” The attempts 
were unsuccessful.

“I guess those games … I don’t 

know. (They) just seem like a lot 
more intense. (“Skyrim”) just 
feels a lot more original, and it’s 
not specifically a story, it’s just a 
world to explore. Exploration, I 
guess, is the biggest difference. 
Other games, it’s just a lot of 
taking over enemy territory.”

Matt also never played “Sky-

rim” ’s predecessor, 2006’s “The 
Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,” but 
watched his brother play it.

Checking that the conversa-

tion recording was still going, 
I watched Matt kill a rabid 
wolf, called a “loup” in the 
French translation. Matt then 
expressed his disdain for always 
having to kill stuff while explor-
ing “Skyrim” ’s overworld. He 
felt it interrupted the pace of 
exploration. 

“The combat is the worst 

part,” he said. “That’s why I 
usually play as a guy with a bow 
and arrow or magic. It’s just 
like, being a cool sniper. Then, 
I can just keep looking around.”

To conclude our conversation, 

I asked Matt how he felt about 
the upgrades included with the 
new version of the game.

“I think it’s awesome,” he 

said. “I feel like the visual aes-
thetic is a big part of what 
makes this a game. And the 
improvements 
are 
awesome. 

Yeah, I definitely noticed them. 
It just makes the world seem 
more real. The light effects, the 
cool sounds and stuff.”

I pointed out the deep red 

sky in the background of Matt’s 
mountain voyage. I didn’t rec-
ognize the way the sky looked 
from the original version of the 
game.

“That’s a big thing in this one. 

The sky is always different.”

Matt said that if he were 

in my position, he would give 
“Skyrim Special Edition” an A+.

“The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 

Special Edition” was reviewed 
using a post-launch digital copy 
provided by Bethesda.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

On the morning of Nov. 12, 

the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture, alongside architecture 
firm Lord Aeck Sargent, opened 
its new exhibit “Triptychs.” The 
exhibit honors LAS’s founding 
principal and Taubman alum, 
Terry 
Sargent, 
who 
passed 

away in 2014. “Triptychs” dis-
plays Sargent’s original sketches 
and shows how they have been 
brought to life.

Since the ’90s, Lord Aeck Sar-

gent has had a deep concentra-
tion in sustainability. With four 
different office locations, Uni-
versity of Michigan alumni and 
buildings all over college cam-
puses, LAS has made a name for 
itself as a top, modern day archi-
tecture firm.

Joe Greco, president of LAS, 

and Jim Nicolow, director and 
architect of LAS Ann Arbor 
office, 
both 
discussed 
their 

company and the work of Mr. 
Sargent in an interview last Sat-
urday, before the opening of this 
long-awaited exhibit. Their cur-
rent goal is to create buildings 
that produce more energy than 
the energy that is used.

“The work of sustainability 

comes from a grass roots level 
… It’s not about high tech engi-
neering. It’s about smart choices 
and how the systems are all inte-
grated in a cohesive way that are 
high performing,” Greco said. 
“It’s all part of the design pro-
cess.” 

“We always look at the local 

climate (when thinking about 
design) and what are the oppor-
tunities and challenges posed by 
those climates,” Nicolow added.

Many of LAS’s buildings are 

at universities like Baylor Uni-
versity’s College of Medicine, 

Georgia State University, Geor-
gia Tech University, Michigan 
State University and the Univer-
sity of Michigan’s Dearborn and 
Ann Arbor campuses.

“David Orr said that ‘architec-

ture is crystallized pedagogy’,” 
Nicolow said. “(The company 
tries to) have the building not 
only be sustainable and sensi-
tive to the environment, but to 
also do it in a way that is under-
standable and provides teaching 
moments.”

These teaching moments also 

shine through in the showcase. 
“Triptychs” shows three-piece 
panels of the evolution of an 
architecture 
design: 
begin-

ning with Sargent’s sketches, 
moving to Barbara Ratner’s 
watercolors and finishing with 
Jonathon Hillyer’s photography 
of the building itself. Greco and 
Nicolow noted some of the final 
products don’t look exactly like 
the sketch, but there is always 
some piece of Sargent’s creative 
work that is embedded in the 
building.

“(Sargent) was never egotisti-

cal,” Greco said. “He taught us 
that the firm revolves around 
serious collaboration. That was 
his legacy and his approach.”

When asked what three words 

best describe “Triptychs” and 
Mr. Sargent’s work, the two said: 
“Integrated, 
Innovative 
and 

Poetic.” With those three words 
in mind, we headed over to the 
exhibit after the interview.

The gallery is located at the 

Taubman College Liberty Gal-
lery at 305 W. Liberty Street. For 
anyone who has ever been there 
before knows that that studio 
warehouse itself is a piece of art. 
With high ceilings, lots of natu-
ral light and an abundance of 
architecture projects and mod-
els, it feels like the perfect place 

to present Sargent’s architectur-
al designs.

The gallery shows numer-

ous projects that Sargent pro-
posed along with the water color 
renderings and the final pho-
tographs. To see the transforma-
tion of sketch lines on paper to 
full-fledged, sustainable, func-
tional buildings was immensely 
impressive to view. As someone 
who highly appreciates archi-
tecture, I could not find a more 
inspiring exhibit to attend.

Those three words Greco and 

Nicolow used can be seen in the 
integration of three different 
art forms — sketching, painting 
and photography. They all cap-
ture that same concept, but in 
diverse mediums. These build-
ings are innovative not only to 
modern day architecture, but 
also to all people and the envi-
ronment. These designs demand 
to be noticed — they are com-
plex and simple together in a 
style that can only be defined as 
poetic.

Sargent’s work at Taubman 

and LAS is what can only be 
described as highly credible. 
Along with the fine work of 
Barbara Ratner and Jonathon 
Hillyer, these talented artists 
form the building blocks to the 
evolutionary effect of triptychs.

One can clearly see the 

importance of Sargent’s work 
to LAS, to Taubman and to the 
overarching field of architec-
ture when visiting this exhibit. 
In addition to the gallery, there 
were 
multiple 
testimonials 

about working with Sargent and 
the kind of man and architect he 
was — one whose footprint has 
been made on his buildings, in 
his firm, and right here at the 
University. 

“Triptychs” will be displayed 

until Dec. 18.

CONCERT REVIEW

Alex G shows don’t work quite 

like other shows.

Normally, the kind of audience 

member who shouts out song 
titles, demanding that the band 
play them, is looked down on. 
It takes a certain level of either 
ignorance or arrogance (or both) 
to believe that you should be the 
one telling the artist what to do. 
At The Blind Pig on Saturday, 
however, during the final show of 
Alex G’s tour with openers LVL 
UP and Brandon Can’t Dance, 
these more vocal showgoers were 
rewarded. Alex G only really ever 
prepares half of their setlist, and 
leaves the rest up to the audience, 
so when the audience started 
chanting “Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!” 
the band responded by playing 
“Sarah” — though not before Alex 
himself pretended to be angry 
with the audience for shouting 
their request.

What happens between songs, 

though, is one of the most reward-
ing aspects of an Alex G show. 
Alex readily riffs back and forth 
with the audience, often riffing 
on inane little bits that would fall 
flat were it not for his delivery. 
After the first few songs, he asked 
the audience, “Hey, you guys ever 
seen ‘Lord of the Rings’? Yeah, I 

was an extra in that movie … They 
flew me out to New Zealand.”

There’s nothing innately funny 

about this statement, but the con-
fidence with which it was said 
and his feigned expectation that 
the audience would be impressed 
made it resonate. Even better was 
when he asked, one song later, 
whether the audience was famil-
iar with “Harry Potter and the 
Chamber of Secrets” — “I was in 
that movie too.” About five min-
utes later he also let the audience 
know that he was in “The Matrix: 
Reloaded.” So as not to tire the 
bit, he stopped there.

About 15 minutes into the set, 

Alex let the crowd know that the 
band was about to play their last 
song — the show ended about an 
hour and several songs later. A 
lot of people find his behavior on 
stage cocky and off-putting, but it 
truly is a part of the art of putting 
on a show (or it is for Alex G, at 
least). Multi-faceted performance 
at its finest, with not just music 
live, but an offbeat comedy show 
interspersed with occasional cul-
tural commentary. It’s refresh-
ing to see a performer who is 
also a person, and it’s easy to see 
that Alex G — the person and the 
band — really just aim to have fun 
onstage.

At one point during the show, 

someone in the front row request-
ed “All Star” by Smash Mouth. 
Keeping with their tradition of 
letting the audience decide their 
show, Alex asked if anyone in 
the crowd knew all of the lyrics, 
and invited the young man who 
volunteered himself up on to the 
stage. What followed was comedy 
and art in an absurd conglomera-
tion. After the first verse-chorus 
cycle of “All Star,” Alex G’s lead 
guitarist started singing “Closing 
Time” by Semisonic on top of the 
already bizarre cover.

Later, after a spontaneous 

discussion of the virtues of Tom 
Cruise, the band announced that 
they would be playing two more 
songs, one that the audience 
could choose, then an encore. 
After playing “Animals” per 
request, Alex told the crowd the 
show was over. About 30 sec-
onds later, the band started their 
last song. Starting as a rolling, 
jazzy piece, Alex changed the 
keyboard he was playing to the 
DJ Sampler setting, and absur-
dity once again became the driv-
ing force of the show. The next 
three minutes were loaded with 
“woo”s and “yeah”s and artifi-
cial vinyl scratches, and you’d be 
hard-pressed to find someone in 
the audience who didn’t crack a 
smile.

Alex G brings welcome absurdity,

I

n the midst of an anxious 
and turbulent election, 
on Tuesday, November 

8, 2016, I fell asleep at 10:30 
P.M. I attribute my ability to 
doze off in 
this time 
of intense 
pressure to 
both my self-
diagnosed 
“stress-
induced 
narcolepsy” 
and the 
melatonin 
gummies I 
took from my 
roommate. Either way, I woke 
up at four in the morning on 
Wednesday, November 9 to dis-
cover that President-elect Don-
ald Trump won the over 270 
Electoral College votes neces-
sary to secure the presidency. 

I got up, turned on my 

light and took out my copy 
of “Swamplandia,” by Karen 
Russell. “Swamplandia” is not 
strictly apocalyptic in a tra-
ditional sense, since it doesn’t 
detail a societal collapse with 
zombies or a plague. But at its 
core, it shares a common theme 
with all apocalyptic literature: 
survival. The story centers on 
the Bigtrees, a family that runs 
an alligator theme park in Flor-
ida. Within the first few pages, 
the matriarch of the family dies 
of breast cancer and her death 
catalyzes their financial and 
emotional collapse.

Flipping to page eight, I read 

the lines that I was specifically 
looking for, the ones that could 
so perfectly capture how I was 
feeling. I strained my eyes to 
read the words, their poignan-
cy echoing in my silent house.

“The Beginning of the End 

can feel a lot like the middle 
when you are living in it ... 
If you’re short on time, that 
would be the two word version 
of our story — we fell.”

This fall takes place at the 

start of “Swamplandia,” and 

it’s a subdued descent that hits 
you all at once. The kind where 
in a single page, any semblance 
of safety or magic evaporates. 
That page might be in the 
weathered copy of “Swamp-
landia” on my bookshelf, or it 
might be a web page on a phone 
with its blue light broadcasting 
the glaring red of an electoral 
map.

There’s a downward momen-

tum and uncertainty to this 
election that makes people 
who diverge from the white, 
straight, male norm lie awake 
at night. Of course, people who 
voted for Trump are entitled 
to their vote and free speech. 
They are not all racists or sex-
ists, but to have voted for him, 
they needed to look past some 
damning evidence of sexual 
assault and countless examples 
of prejudice and ignorance. 
We’re hearing the same hateful 
rhetoric that has been simmer-
ing under the societal surface 
for years, at a much higher 
pitch.

This rhetoric can be alarm-

ing and frustrating, especially 
on this campus, where students 
of marginalized identities are 
constantly forced to speak 
as experts on diversity while 
simultaneously combatting 
intolerance and hate. Conser-
vative news is attributing the 
drastic reaction of students 
to the way we see ourselves 
as special snowflakes who 
can’t stand to have people 
disagree with us. In reality, 
what we can’t stand is violence 
and hatred directed towards 
women, minorities and queer 
and trans people.

This feels like the part of 

this piece where I should say 
that we need empathy, that in 
apocalyptic literature there’s 
always a societal divide and 
that polarization is normal, 
even encouraged in political 
races. That empathy could save 
the day, start a dialogue and 
create space for understanding 

both sides. I could even bring it 
back to literature and say that 
reading fiction increases the 
human capacity for empathy. 
(It does. By reading we slip into 
the lives of people who are so 
unlike us that we learn what 
it’s like to be someone else, 
improving our social skills and 
compassion.) Trump and his 
supporters are asking America 
to trust him, and empathy 
seems to be a first step to trust 
and unity. 

But trust must be earned. 

Trump’s speech throughout his 
campaign was fueled by racism, 
xenophobia, homophobia and 
sexism. It’s not my place to tell 
anyone whether they should 
move past that or not in the 
name of uniting the country. 
There have been hundreds of 
hate crimes across the country 
since last Tuesday’s election. 
People have a right to be scared 
and angry.

This has been a confus-

ing and disjointed year — in 
2016, Beyonce’s Lemonade was 
released, Donald Trump was 
elected to be the leader of the 
free world and the terrifying 
force of Harambe memes were 
unleashed upon the internet. 
We live in troubling times. It’s 
hard to take seriously a plea 
for unity coming from the 
same people who allowed or 
perpetrated rallying cries of 
division. It’s hard not to see the 
transition of power from Presi-
dent Obama to President-elect 
Trump as symbolic of some-
thing bigger and more sinister 
coming our way. 

But this is not the end. 

Obama told us that now is not 
the time to get cynical, that 
the sun would come up no mat-
ter who was elected. Thus far, 
he’s been right. So this isn’t the 
apocalypse. But it could be the 
start of a fall.

FOR RENT

HELP WANTED

Athletes retire; artists die. On 

March 22, Malik “Phife Dawg” 
Taylor – the funky diabetic – 
finally 
lost 
his 

career-spanning 
fight with diabe-
tes at the age of 
45. What started 
as a strain on 
his 
relationship 

with the Tribe 
(most infamously, 
Q-Tip), 
doubled 

as a beautifully 
fitting 
jolt 
of 

mortality to bring 
everyone togeth-
er for a parting piece.

After 18 years of silence, 

A Tribe Called Quest’s latest 
album features all four of the 
founding members, including 
Jarobi White, who left the group 
before the release of The Low 
End Theory in ’91. Though Pfife 
couldn’t make it to the album’s 
release or the stunning SNL per-
formances, his voice haunts the 
project and the minds of hip-hop 
purists for generations to come.

The title alone lends itself to 

some sort of cryptic sendoff: We 
Got It from Here... Thank You 4 
Your Service. Legend has it that 
Phife himself chose the title, 
without explanation. But would 
he really thank himself for his 
services? Released suspiciously 
close to the presidential elec-
tion, perhaps the title doubles as 
an ode to another Black Ameri-
can. Perhaps he foresaw a nation 
built on slave labor replac-
ing its first African-American 
president with a man who cam-
paigned on hate speech. Why 
else does the album close with 
“The Donald”?

Rap music – the music of 

America’s 
cracked 
pavement 

and sidewalks – provides dis-
tillations of our political cli-
mate unlike any other medium. 
I wasn’t around in ’93. I can’t 
speak on how Midnight Maraud-
ers shed light on the issues of its 
time, yet it’s clear as day how A 
Tribe Called Quest has chan-
neled the pulse of its People for 
over 30 years. We Got It from 
Here is not a case of old dogs per-
forming new tricks.

Though elements of songs 

from over 25 years ago are still 
present throughout the album, 
Q-Tip’s forward-thinking cre-
ative direction has proven to be 
timeless. The bassline funk of 
“Sucka N****” lives on within 
“Whateva Will Be,” but is retro-
fitted this time with glitchy soul 
chops and syllables. Considering 
how a song like “Excursions” 
was such an outrageous devia-
tion from the N.W.A. and Public 
Enemy of its time, history shows 
that we shouldn’t be surprised at 
how gracefully Tribe has aged.

They’re not some band of 

washed up, out-of-touch con-
servative hip-hop heads. They 
are 
permanently 
embedded 

into the canon of American rap 

music, and it’s awesome to see 
their awareness of it 18 years 
after the fact. On “Dis Genera-
tion” Q-Tip jibes “Talk to Joey, 
Kendrick and Cole / gatekeepers 
of flow / They are extensions of 

instinctual 
soul.” 

The entire song is a 
proverbial passing 
of the Zulu torch.

The same inclu-

sive approach to 
collaboration that 
birthed the Native 
Tongues has yield-
ed an album ros-
ter 
with 
friends 

old and new alike: 
Kanye West, André 
3000, Jack White, 

Consequence, Kendrick Lamar, 
Talib Kweli, Anderson .Paak and 
of course the ever-present Busta 
Rhymes.

The range of guests can make 

Thank You 4 Your Service almost 
feel like a high-school-reunion-
turned-going-away-party. Some 
friends come and go, some stick 
around longer. Kendrick Lamar 
stops by for only 20 seconds on 
“Conrad Tokyo,” but squeezes 
every bit of life from within him 
to conjure a verse that could 
make you believe that maybe, 
just maybe, it’ll bring Phife back.

The most damning thing 

about the record is that maybe 
this isn’t a world that Phife 
would even want to re-enter, 
anyways; Lamar, 29, and Phife, 
45, are generations apart but 
participants in the same Black 
American experience: “Trump 
and SNL hilarity / Troublesome 
times kid, no time for comedy 
/ … / Bullshit you spewing / As 
if this country isn’t already 
ruined.”

Old friends bring with them 

the warmth of tradition and 
familiarity. Busta Rhymes’ fin-
gerprints are predictably all over 
the album, illuminating tracks 
like “Mobius” and “The Don-
ald” with the energy of reunited 
homies. You can practically hear 
how giddy he is to share a studio 
with Phife, switching directions 
mid-verse in his classic scatter-
brained delivery: “Ayo wait wait 
wait, I gotta go again!” He never 
does go again, opting instead to 
drop hilarious pieces of street 
wisdom: “Keep it moving / Keep 
the convo short / Bring a case 
of Henny.” Bussa Buss’ promi-
nence on We Got It from Here 
is a reminder of the grassroots 
spirit Tribe has carried since 
Instinctive Travels; always have 
fun with it, and it shows in the 
music.

Album-opener 
“The 
Space 

Program” is similarly vintage 
Tribe, with Jarobi speaking on 
the prison-industrial complex 
in the absolute zaniest fashion 
possible: “Rather see we in a 
three-by-three structure with 
many bars / Leave us where 
so many are, so they can play 
with the stars / They takin’ off 
to Mars, got the space vessels 
overflowing / What, you think 
they want us there? All us n***** 
not going.” Tip chimes in more 
bluntly: “There ain’t no space 
program for n******.”

Tribe’s transformation hasn’t 

been limited only to their sonic 
palette. Most interestingly, their 
range of political concerns have 
expanded as well. In a year 
that has already seen Young 
Thug don a (very nice) dress 
on the cover of Jeffery, “We 
The People” is one of the most 
tastefully in-your-face pieces 
of social commentary this year. 
The heaviest synth in the entire 
Tribe discography twists and 
growls under a hook that’s jar-
ring out of sheer simplicity: “All 
you Black folks, you must go / 
All you Mexicans, you must go / 
And all you poor folks, you must 
go / Muslims and gays, boy we 
hate your ways.” Even Phife hits 
his native Patois accent from 
beyond the grave. It’s the energy 
of Run The Jewels but without 
the corny bullshit.

If the uncredited features 

help shroud the project in mys-
tery, the back-and-forth verses 
and left-field beat switches make 
the album excitingly unpre-
dictable for a genre based on 
repetitive loops. One of the most 
pleasant surprises is the Kanye 
West feature on “The Killing 
Season”; with only three words, 
not only does his voice take the 
song by storm, but the sound-
scape beneath him practically 
falls through a trap door.

What starts as an archetypal 

Afro-funk beat makes way for a 
series of crooning melodies that 
Tribe has never even experi-
mented with. Consequence picks 
up where ‘Ye leaves off, and the 
beat never returns to its original 
state. In the arc of the proverbial 
going away party, it feels like the 
part of the night where friends 
are drunk enough to squash 
their beef; maybe the departure 
of a friend reminds them both of 
what’s really important: “Take 
a bow / This might be your last 
performance.”

While We Got It from Here is 

largely a celebratory end to one 
of the greatest stories ever told, 
an undertone of the album is 
this certain anxiety about death. 
The going away party ends, your 
friend leaves, and what’s next 
for you? What’s next for your 
friends? What did you learn from 
the life of someone you liked 
enough to be around? Thank 
You 4 Your Service doesn’t pose 
any solutions, nor does it try to 
be something it isn’t. The simple 
“thank you” is in the title. Thank 
you, and Rest In Beats, Dawg.

Someone’s been shopping at Ragstock.
After 18 years of silence, A Tribe 
Called Quest is still vital and fresh

The late five-foot freak makes his presence felt on first album in 18 years

2016 hasn’t been the easiest 

year on the sci-fi genre. There 
have been some bright spots, to 
be sure, with “Star 
Trek Beyond” and 
“Midnight 
Spe-

cial” both garner-
ing 
considerable 

and 
well-earned 

praise. 
Those 

films have been 
contrasted, 
how-

ever, with “Inde-
pendence 
Day: 
Resurgence,” 

which combined all the mistakes 
of its predecessor with none of 
the charm, and “The Divergent 
Series: Allegiant” and “The 5th 
Wave,” which both made compel-
ling cases for putting a kibosh on 
the modern YA genre. That’s why 
Dennis Villeneuve’s (“Prisoners”) 
“Arrival” is such a breath of fresh 
air. Because it’s not just a good sci-
fi movie; it’s the best kind of sci-fi 
movie. In fact, it’s the best kind of 
movie in general.

It nails the basics, first of all. 

Amy Adams (“Man of Steel”) 
gives the performance of her 
career as Dr. Louise Banks, a 
linguist called in to establish 
communications between the 
American government and a duo 
of aliens who landed in Montana. 
Jeremy Renner (“The Hurt Lock-
er”) and Forest Whittaker (“Pla-
toon”) do great work as well, but 
there is never a scene that isn’t 
absolutely dominated by Adams, 
who perfectly conveys the awe, 
confusion and devastation at the 

seemingly otherworldly transi-
tion her character undergoes.

The cinematography by Brad-

ford Young (“Selma”) is flat-out 
gorgeous. Whether it’s the alien 

craft 
dwarfing 

the mountainside 
it hovers above, 
the mind-bending 
shifts in gravity 
inside the thing or 
the 
simple 
inti-

macy of the scenes 
between 
Adams 

and Renner, Young 

makes every frame a work of 
art. The French-Canadian Vil-
leneuve proves yet again why 
he’s one of the most exciting 
directors working in Hollywood 
today, as his assuredness in both 
his slow pacing and nonlinear 
storytelling serve both to sepa-
rate the film from others of its 
genre and to aid it in exploring 
its themes.

It’s in those themes that 

“Arrival” truly becomes some-
thing special. It’s not a film con-
tent to throw an action scene in 
every half hour on the mark to 
keep viewers in their seats. It isn’t 
the kind of movie where the evil 
aliens are outwitted at the last 
possible second by a Goldblum-
led crew of plucky humans. It’s 
a movie defined by what it says 
rather than what it does.

For one, it’s a love letter to lan-

guage. Louise Banks waxes phil-
osophical about how language is 
“the cornerstone of civilization” 
and can change the way people 
think about and comprehend 

even simple subjects. Renner 
narrates to explain how the 
word “heptapod” was decided 
upon for the aliens. The hepta-
pod language itself is incredibly 
inventive and fits both visually 
and thematically into the world 
of the story. A love of language, 
in big ways and small, somehow 
permeates every scene of the 
movie.

More than that, “Arrival” is a 

film about humanity. This isn’t 
new to the sci-fi genre, as even 
the lesser films listed earlier 
managed to boil down to “Peo-
ple working together is good, 
so work together, people.” Vil-
leneuve and screenwriter Eric 
Heisserer (“Lights Out”) dig a 
layer deeper, though. “Arrival,” 
at its core, is about how human-
ity deals with grief — both the 
existential 
grief 
that 
comes 

with realizing the universe isn’t 
as empty as we thought or the 
far more relatable grief of loss. 
Ultimately, it also uses its wildly 
unique structuring to demon-
strate that moving beyond that 
grief is often the only way to live 
a life worth living.

It’s difficult to describe just 

how special “Arrival” is with-
out delving too deeply into what 
could be considered “spoiler ter-
ritory,” so it must be left at just 
that. It’s the third in Denis Ville-
neuve’s hat trick of modern mas-
terpieces (with “Prisoners” and 
“Sicario” rounding out the list), 
a high-concept sci-fi film that’s 
an absolute must-see for fans of 
the genre.

Injury puts Speight’s status in question

The Michigan football team 

may have lost more than just the 
game on Saturday, as redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight suffered a shoulder 
injury late in the 14-13 loss at 
Iowa and now could miss this 
week’s 
home 
finale 
against 

Indiana.

Reports from MGoBlog and 

The Detroit Free Press each 
cited a source who said Speight 
broke his collarbone and would 
miss the rest of the regular 
season.

Speight said Saturday night 

that his shoulder was bothering 
him during the game. On the last 
pass he threw, Iowa defensive 
end Parker Hesse came in 
unblocked and hit Speight in the 
left shoulder. Speight came up 
holding his arm and grimacing.

During 
his 
weekly 
press 

conference Monday — before the 
reports of a broken collarbone 
— Harbaugh gave no specifics 
on Speight’s injury regarding 
severity, 
possible 
structural 

damage or prognosis.

“When we’ll know is based 

on what the doctors say and 
how Wilton’s feeling, what he’s 
able to do in terms of practice, 
et cetera,” Harbaugh said. He 
added that the decision on 
Speight’s status could be made 
as late as game time Saturday.

A broken collarbone, though, 

would mean that Speight would 
certainly miss at least this 
week’s game and next week’s 
showdown at Ohio State, and 
perhaps whichever bowl game 
Michigan lands in around New 
Year’s Day. The injury usually 
takes at least six weeks to heal, 
which would put Speight back at 
practice around the time of the 
bowl game.

If Speight can’t play Saturday, 

the starting job would likely 

go to Houston transfer John 
O’Korn, who has played several 
snaps as a backup in blowouts 
this season. He is 13-for-18 for 
114 yards and two touchdowns 
in seven games, though he has 
not started.

Still, 
Speight’s 
absence 

would be a blow to Michigan’s 
offense next week against the 
fifth-ranked Buckeyes, if not 
this week against the Hoosiers. 
His 
struggles 
Saturday 

notwithstanding 
— 
Speight 

completed just 11 of 26 passes for 
103 yards and a late interception 
at Iowa — he has been one of 
the offense’s most productive 
players.

“That would be tough — 

Wilton’s done a great job, 
he’s been a great leader for us 
and he’s stepped up for us in 
countless situations throughout 
the whole entire season,” said 
senior tight end Jake Butt on 
Monday. “But John’s a great 
leader, too. John will get ready 
to go, and he’s one of those guys 
that leads by example with his 
work ethic. So as an offense, 
we’ll all stand behind whoever’s 
in that huddle.”

O’Korn, who transferred to 

Michigan in 2015 after Harbaugh 
was hired, sat out last season per 
NCAA transfer rules and spent 
the year on the scout team. He 
and redshirt junior Shane Morris 
battled Speight for the starting 
job for the duration of spring 
and fall camps before Speight 
ultimately won out.

But some lopsided scores in 

the Wolverines’ victories have 
inserted O’Korn plenty of times. 
On Oct. 8, when Michigan 
trampled Rutgers, 78-0, O’Korn 
played the entire second half.

“If John’s number is called, 

we’re fully confident in him,” Butt 
said. “We’ve seen what he can 
do since he got here. He’s been 
a hard worker, great note-taker, 
great leader. He’s got everything 

you need to do to get the job 
done. So if his number is called, 
if it turns out that Wilton can’t 
go, he’ll be ready to go, and we’re 
fully confident in him.”

Speight’s 
first 
encounter 

with the Michigan quarterback 
job came just over a year ago, 
also because of an injury. The 
Wolverines’ starter, Iowa transfer 
Jake Rudock, suffered an injury 
on a hit at Minnesota on Oct. 
31. Speight came in and threw a 
game-winning touchdown pass 
to fifth-year senior wide receiver 
Jehu Chesson to lead Michigan to 
a 27-23 victory.

Rudock returned the next week 

against Rutgers and won four 
of his last five starts, alleviating 

any concern. This year, the 
Wolverines find themselves in 
another predicament, though this 
one may be more serious.

“Wilton stood back there — 

we’ve seen him take some hard 
shots all season,” Butt said. 
“Kind of similar to how Rudock 
did last year. Just kept bouncing 
back and putting the team first. 
He understood he was in pain. I 
think he knew he wasn’t the only 
guy. We’re all sacrificing for the 
greater good of the team right 
here.”

That put him on track to 

become the starter, a job he has 
kept all season. The redshirt 
junior transfer played for a year 
and a half at Houston, making 

his last start in a loss to Central 
Florida on Oct. 2, 2014.

He is smaller than Speight 

and a less consistent passer, but 
he does add more of a running 
dimension. Despite losing the 
competition this summer, O’Korn 
has earned nothing but praise 
since he started on the practice 
field.

“John’s been great — he’s 

been amazing,” redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst 
said. “They were competing until 
basically the start of the season 
for the starting spot. They’re 
both really great players, and I 
definitely have full confidence 
in John, have full confidence in 
Wilton.”

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight suffered a shoulder injury in Michigan’s 14-13 loss to Iowa.

Harbaugh credits seniors for stopping ‘freight train’

For a month at the end of 

2014, the Michigan football 
team was a group with no coach 
and no sign that things were 
heading in a positive direction.

The Wolverines were coming 

off a 5-7 season and had fired 
coach Brady Hoke. The roster 
was 
composed 
of 
talented 

recruits, but they couldn’t even 
muster wins against Maryland 
or Rutgers to secure bowl 
eligibility.

Jim Hackett, then Michigan’s 

interim Athletic Director, gave 
those players a chance to decide 
what they needed to get back on 
track. Over the course of several 
meetings, Hackett asked the 
players what qualities they were 
looking for in a new head coach — 
ideally, one who could bring out 
all that untapped potential.

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

Hackett found a coach who met 
all the players’ criteria: Jim 
Harbaugh.

The turnaround has been well-

documented and well-publicized 
— a 10-3 record last season 
and a 9-0 start this year before 
Michigan was upset by Iowa on 
Saturday night.

But 
with 
Senior 
Day 
at 

Michigan Stadium coming up this 
week, the man who kickstarted 
the 
Wolverines’ 
renaissance 

directed the attention to the 
players 
who 
stuck 
around 

through it all.

“This class has meant so 

much 
to 
me 
personally, 
to 

Michigan football, to all of us,” 
Harbaugh said. “You look at 
these guys — the direction of the 
program was going a certain way, 
almost like a locomotive. These 
upperclassmen, these seniors, 
guys last year who played as well, 
it meant a lot to get it stopped, to 
get that momentum stopped. Like 
stopping a freight train.

“I credit them for not only 

getting it stopped, but even 
harder, getting it turned on the 
tracks and headed the other 
direction.”

Senior tight end Jake Butt is 

just one of many Wolverines who 
have been through the wringer 
over the last few years, hoping 
their work would eventually pay 
off.

The players never doubted they 

had the talent to be successful 
— they just needed a push in the 
right direction.

“We always knew we had 

talent,” Butt said. “It was just 
about putting all the pieces 

together. Coach Harbaugh, he’s 
like a wizard, man. He brought in 
unbelievable coaches, and it took 
a lot of time, a lot of hours, a lot 
of hard work and a lot of sacrifice 
by everyone on this team and 
around the program, but it was 
all for the right reasons. And now, 
here we are with a chance to do 
something great.”

Butt said before the season 

that one of the biggest mental 
shifts under Harbaugh was an 
increased urgency to not let one 
loss turn into two. That mindset 
has paid off so far — Michigan has 
yet to lose back-to-back games 
under Harbaugh — and now it 

will be tested again this week, 
as it tries to rebound from a last-
second upset by the Hawkeyes.

The Wolverines have claimed 

to be treating every game the 
same way so far this season, and 
Harbaugh has been a picture of 
that. Butt said Harbaugh tells 
his players to go 100 percent all 
the time — never 110 percent. 
That 
steadiness 
has 
created 

an increased urgency to leave 
nothing up to chance, especially 
after losses.

Of course, it helps to have a 

senior class that refuses to “hit 
the panic button.” According 
to Butt, they’ve been around 

long enough to know that one 
loss doesn’t necessarily warrant 
drastic changes.

If they’ve learned anything 

from their roller-coaster ride at 
Michigan, it’s how to lose and 
come back stronger.

“We’ve got a ton of seniors 

on both sides of the ball and 
special teams,” Butt said. “We’ve 
got experienced coaches that 
have 
experienced 
big 
wins, 

heartbreaking losses at different 
levels and as players. We all kind 
of understand a little bit how this 
goes, and having said that, we’ll 
be able to handle this situation 
pretty well.”

Big Ten falls, but 
Wolverines shine
at USA Challenge

For once, Big Ten swimmers 

weren’t competing against each 
other.

This 
weekend, 
swimmers 

from the conference formed 
a collective team and faced 
select members of Team USA 
in the USA College Challenge. 
Representing Michigan on the 
Big Ten team were five swimmers 
from the men’s swimming and 
diving team, along with four 
members from the women’s 
team. Michigan coach Mike 
Bottom attended the dual-meet 
in Indianapolis, overseeing the 
women’s Big Ten team.

“It wasn’t really about our 

teams. It was about us coming 
together as a conference,” Bottom 
said. 
“We’re 
all 
competing, 

but 
yet 
the 
competition 
is 

making everyone better and 
we have learned to appreciate 
our competitors as well as the 
competition.”

In spite of the united effort, the 

Big Ten fell short of a win, losing 
to Team USA, 349-247. Though 
the Big Ten lost, the weekend was 
still a success for the conference 
as several collegiate records 
were broken by swimmers from 
all 
schools. 

Michigan 
sophomore 
Siobhàn 
Haughey 
beat 

her 
previous 

Big 
Ten 
and 

Michigan record 
in the 200-yard 
freestyle — the 
same 
event 

she 
competed 

in 
during 
the 

semifinals 
of 
the 
2016 
Rio 

Olympics — by 0.42 seconds 
with a time of 1:42.93. Haughey’s 
time was the fastest recorded 
time nationally in the 200-yard 
freestyle this season.

Another 
Wolverine 
with 

a standout performance this 
weekend was freshman Charlie 
Swanson. One of only three 
Big Ten winners on Saturday, 
Swanson finished first in the 
400-yard individual medley with 
a time of 3:46.09.

Also on Saturday, both fifth-

year senior Luke Papendick and 
junior PJ Ransford placed third in 
the 200-yard backstroke (1:43.71) 
and in the 100-yard butterfly 
(47.06), respectively. Junior Evan 
White, recently coming off of an 
injury, flirted with his personal 
best of 46.56 in the 100-yard 
butterfly (47.06), taking sixth in 
the event this weekend. Coming 
in seventh for the Big Ten in the 
100-yard freestyle (44.15) was 
junior Paul Powers.

Powers had the highest finish 

for Michigan’s men’s swimming 
on Sunday with a second-place 
finish in the 50-yard freestyle 
(19.79), his best time in this event 
so far this season. Ransford took 
third in the 1,000-yard freestyle 
(8:55.40) while Swanson placed 
seventh (9:22.93). Michigan had 
another top-three finish with 
White taking third in the 200-
yard individual medley (1:46.63). 
In 
the 
100-yard 
backstroke, 

Papendick finished fifth with a 
time of 47.41.

And the Wolverine women 

had exceptional performances 
too. 
Junior 
Gabby 
DeLoof 

competed against her sister and 
former Michigan teammate Ali 
DeLoof in the 400-yard freestyle 
relay. Team USA won the event 
with a time of 3:11.64, with Ali 
DeLoof swimming as the leadoff. 
Finishing second, Haughey and 
Gabby DeLoof contributed to the 
Big Ten’s relay team as the third 
and fourth legs.

Sophomore Yirong Bi helped 

the Big Ten with a third-place 
finish in the 1,000-yard freestyle. 
Competing 
in 
the 
100-yard 

medley backstroke was junior 
Clara Smiddy. Smiddy finished 
sixth behind Ali DeLoof, who 
beat the 51-second barrier with 

a time of 50.99 in 
the event.

“When 
you 

go 
down 
the 

line in almost 
every individual 
(event), 
we 

swam 
well,” 

Bottom said. “As 
a whole, the Big 
Ten swam and 
competed 
very 

well with a lot of 

best times.”

Though the Big Ten ultimately 

lost, multiple Big Ten relay 
teams set top collegiate times, 
demonstrating 
the 
potential 

strength of a future national team 
when some of these collegiate 
swimmers unite. Top times were 
recorded in the men’s 800-yard 
freestyle relay (6:19.08), the 400-
yard medley relay (3:07.93) and the 
400-yard freestyle relay (2:50.81). 
For the women, top times were 
recorded in the 400-yard medley 
relay 
(3:29.65), 
the 
800-yard 

freestyle relay (7:00.40) and the 
400-yard freestyle relay (3:13.29).

“The big lesson learned was 

that if you come together for 
a common goal, you can unite 
people,” Bottom said. “We stand 
in a world that’s really divided 
right now and it’s fun to see what 
happened at the meet, where Big 
Ten teams that are competitive 
came together in a way that really 
was exemplary and what we’re 
trying to do as a country.”

Junior forward Dexter Dancs tallied a goal and an assist in Michigan’s two-game series against Boston University.

Dancs looks to build on weekend improvement 

With just under 10 minutes 

left in the first period of 
Friday’s game against Boston 
University, the Michigan hockey 
team was on its second power 
play. Freshman forward Will 
Lockwood had just scored to put 
the Wolverines up, 1-0, and the 
team was looking to earn some 
cushion against the fourth-
ranked Terriers.

Junior forward Dexter Dancs 

received a pass from freshman 
defenseman Luke Martin at the 
blue line, and skated it up the 
right boards. Dancs drew Boston 
University’s 
Bobo 
Carpenter 

toward him, but right before 
Carpenter reached him, Dancs 
dished a backhanded pass to 
junior forward Tony Calderone, 
who ripped a one-timer through 
a crowd and into the back of the 
net.

It was just what Michigan 

needed.

The Terriers represented the 

Wolverines’ biggest game of the 
year, but there was one problem 
entering the matchup — Michigan 
was down a few seniors. Forwards 
Alex Kile and Max Shuart, 
defenseman Nolan De Jong and 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort were 
suspended for “breaking team 
rules,” and as a result, Michigan 
coach Red Berenson and his staff 
had to reshuffle their lines.

Dancs was one beneficiary of 

the change. He was one of the 
returners from last season that 
was expected to make a leap 
in productivity this year. But 
because of a slow start — Dancs 
had only one point through eight 
games — the junior has spent 
much of the season being moved 
from line to line in an effort to 
spark the offensive side of his 
game.

Friday, Dancs was placed on 

the first line with Lockwood 
and freshman forward Jake 
Slaker, who have been some of 
the most consistent producers 
for the Wolverines. As it turns 
out, their performances may 

have been contagious. Dancs put 
together the best weekend of his 
season, assisting Calderone on 
Friday before tallying a goal for 
himself on Saturday.

After notching two points on 

the weekend, Dancs attributed 
his performance 
to 
both 
past 

success 
before 

college 
and 

his 
practice 

regiment 
this 

season.

“Scoring goals 

is what I used 
to do before I 
got here,” Dancs 
said. “The past 
two 
years, 

there’s been some players ahead 
of me that are very good. And 
I’ve gotten to watch them and 
learn from them. And I’ve been 
doing a lot of stuff with (assistant 
coach 
Brian) 
Wiseman. 
He 

scored a lot of goals when he was 
here, so he’s been helping me.”

While the offensive side of 

Dancs’ game is important, it 
wasn’t the only aspect in which 
he was better this weekend. 
Dancs also played a more physical 
brand of hockey. He was involved 
in multiple big hits, and was 

often 
chasing 

and battling for 
the puck in the 
corners.

But 
whether 

it’s 
with 

physicality 
or 

finesse on the 
offensive 
side 

of 
the 
puck, 

perhaps the most 
important thing 
for Dancs is to 

know his role on the team.

“I think he’s figuring it out,” 

Berenson said. “He’s starting to 
realize how he has to play to help 
our team. Sometimes a player 
comes out and they do what 
they want to do. And if they’re 
not doing what we need them to 

do, then they can be out of sync. 
And I think Dexter was out of 
sync. And now he’s playing more 
physical, he’s playing harder and 
he’s playing better.”

Though 
the 
improvement 

came to fruition this weekend, 
there is still work to be done.

“If he plays his best, I think 

he can be a top-six forward on 
this team, but last year he ended 
up playing mostly on the bottom 
six,” Berenson said. “He’s just 
now starting to show what he 
was doing last year. And if he 
develops — if he continues to 
improve — he’ll have a better 
role. He can help our power play 
if he plays well, and he can help 
our top six forwards.”

Added 
Dancs: 
“Coming 

into this year, my goal was to 
contribute 
more 
offensively. 

Throughout the first few games, 
it hasn’t gone that way for me. 
But I know if I trust the process 
and keep working hard, that’ll 
come.”

“Scoring goals 
is what I used 
to do before 
I got here.”

Five things we learned: Howard & IUPUI

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team kicked off its season this past 
weekend with two double-digit 
victories over Howard and IUPUI 
in the Ann Arbor regional of the 
2K Classic.

Against Howard on Friday, the 

Wolverines struggled to deal with 
a matchup zone defense, a defense 
Michigan coach John Beilein said 
he had never seen in all his years 
of 
coaching. 
The 
Wolverines 

overpowered the Bisons, though, 
who ranked No. 328 in RPI last 
season and were missing James 
Daniel — the NCAA’s leading 
scorer last season — to an injury. 

Sunday 
against 
IUPUI, 

Michigan strung together a 13-0 
run to end the first half and went 
on to beat the Jaguars, 77-65.

The Wolverines will now travel 

to New York City to play in the 
2K Classic Championship Round. 
Michigan will play Marquette on 

Thursday and either Southern 
Methodist or Pittsburgh on Friday. 
But until then, here are five things 
we 
learned 
from 
Michigan’s 

season-opening weekend.

1. DJ Wilson is legit

During Michigan’s media day 

back on Oct. 3, Beilein likened 
the redshirt sophomore forward’s 
potential to that of former Indiana 
forward Troy Williams, who now 
plies his craft in the NBA with the 
Memphis Grizzlies.

No one, however, was expecting 

to see a return on that statement so 
early in the season. Friday against 
Howard, Wilson was a force inside, 
grabbing eight rebounds and 
scoring nine points in 20 minutes 
of action. Wilson continued his 
solid play Sunday, notching career 
highs in rebounds and blocks with 
14 and five, respectively. 

“His mindset is to get in 

there and get rebounds, loose 
basketballs, everything,” Beilein 
said. “... If he says to himself, ‘I am 
a rebounder and defender,’ he’ll get 
baskets.”

2. The battle between Donnal 

and Wagner is far from over

Going into the game against 

Howard, 
Beilein 
stated 
that 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner would get the start. But by 
the end of the game, it was redshirt 
junior Mark Donnal who got the 
advantage in minutes, playing 
eight more than Wagner.

Sunday, Wagner started again, 

but Donnal was given ample 
playing time and both players were 
on the court for 19 minutes.

“I think both offensively and 

defensively, I just held my own and 
tried to be an energy guy of the 
bench,” Donnal said after Friday’s 
game.

Beilein now has a conundrum 

on his hands. While Wagner gives 
him a better offensive presence, 
he also also shows flashes of 
immaturity on defense. Against 
Howard, Wagner started the 
second half, but was taken out just 
seconds later for not picking up his 
guard on a ball screen. 

Moving forward, Beilein may 

be forced to switch back and forth 

between his two big men at the ‘5’.

3. Michigan is playing more 

aggressively on defense

Assistant coach Billy Donlon 

came to the team as a defensive-
minded coach, and that was 
evident during both games, when 
Donlon would get up from his seat 
to bark orders when Michigan was 
on the defensive end of the court.

This weekend, the Wolverines 

forced a total of 27 turnovers for an 
average of 13.5 per game, a far cry 
from the 7.5 turnovers Michigan 
forced per game last season. 
Granted, it is still early and this 
year’s average comes from a small 
sample size, but there were visible 
differences 
in 
the 
Wolverine 

defense from last season.

While Michigan was far more 

aggressive on the defensive end, 
it resorted to fouling at times. 
Fortunately for the Wolverines, 
Howard shot just 48 percent from 
the line.

4. The Wolverines are still 

relying heavily on the 3-point 
shot

Over the past several seasons, 

Michigan 
has 
put 
a 
heavy 

emphasis on its ability to shoot 
3-pointers. This weekend, the 

Wolverines shot 35 percent from 
behind the arc.

More interesting, though, was 

how often Michigan shot the 3-ball. 
Forty percent of the Wolverines’ 
shots were from deep, which is in 
line with their performance last 
year, when 43 percent of their 
shots were 3-pointers.

5. Bold prediction: DJ Wilson 

starts over Duncan Robinson 
against Marquette

With how well Wilson has 

played in the first two games of 
the season, Beilein may be forced 
to start Wilson at the ‘4’. Against 
IUPUI, Wilson played 80 percent 
of the minutes in the second half, 
with 
redshirt 
junior 
Duncan 

Robinson to the bench for much of 
the stanza.

“(Duncan’s) role will be varied,” 

Beilein said. “Does he start? Does 
he come off the bench? I love 
having a gunner come off the 
bench.” 

Wilson still has plenty to 

work on, including being more 
aggressive 
on 
the 
offensive 

front. But with his length and 
size, Michigan has a better 
defensive option, and it wouldn’t 
be a surprise to see Wilson in the 
starting five on Thursday night in 
Madison Square Garden.
