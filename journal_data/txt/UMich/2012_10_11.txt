CAMPUS CRIME
AAPD: Rape
account was
fabricated
by student.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BEFORE THE COURT
Supreme Court divided

Ann Arbor Police
Department says
student recanted
incident
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
The student who alleged
she was raped Sunday on Hill
Street has recanted her story,
Ann Arbor Police Lt. Bob
Pfannes said in a statement.
"After a comprehensive
investigation by the Ann Arbor
Police Department, it has been
determined the incident did
not occur," Pfannes said. "The
student has admitted to fabri-
cating the report, and the case
has been sent to the Washt-
enaw County's prosecutor's
office for full review."
The student had previously
told police she was attacked
by four men while walking

home from a party early Sun-
day morning near campus near
Church Street and Tappan
Avenue. After deciding not to
wait for a taxi she called, she
said she proceeded to walk
home.
While en route, she alleged
that the four men dragged
her into an alley and that one
raped her before she was able
to get away.
She could potentially face
charges for filinga false police
report.
At 8:46 p.m. Wednesday,
the University's Department
of Public Safety canceled the
crime alert it had sent out
Sunday morning regarding
the incident. The cancella-
tion states that the Ann Arbor
Police Department investiga-
tion "determined the incident
did not occur."

Kickin' it with Allen Ginsberg

SEASONAL SHINE

What class are you teach-
ing this semester?
Writing Poetry, which is an
introductory writing poetry
class. I also teach tutorials of
various levels where I work
one on one with students.
This is really the way I love to
teach.
Did you always want to be
a poet?
I had no idea until college
when I took poetry classes. I
started in engineering, where
I took chemistry and calculus
and engineering drawing. You
should have seen the look on
my father's face when I said,
"Dad, I think I'm going to

become a poet."
What do you like most
about Ann Arbor?
I'm from Detroit. Ann Arbor
is completely different. There is
nothing like Detroit, and Ann
Arbor is so easy. It's comfort-
able. Everything is here and
everything comes to you here
-music, great films and great
dance. In Detroit, you (have) got
to make it your own. In Detroit,
when I was part of the Cass
Corridor group, a bunch of art-
ists and writers and musicians,
we had to make our own and do
it ourselves. That was great.
Is ittrue that you were
friends withJackKerouac?

No, but I did publish and
know Allen Ginsberg, Gary
Snyder and Diane di Prima.
What do you do in your
free time?
Write poetry, but I am also
working with musicians. I
have been collaborating with
Mike Gould, another RC
professor, on a project that
involves poetry, music, print-
ing and visual arts. Right
now, there is a band in New
York going into the studio in
December to record an entire
album of my poems - a six-
piece jazz band and a vocalist.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Recall hampers
Toyota comeback
The largest recall in Toyota's
75-year history could undermine
the carmaker's comeback from
natural disasters and embarrass-
ing safety problems.
The company on Wednesday
recalled 7.43 million cars, trucks
and SUVs worldwide to fix faulty
power window switches that can
cause fires. The recall affects more
than a dozen models produced
from 2005 through 2010 around
the world including the Camry,
the top-selling car in the U.S. It's
bigger than the 7 million vehicles
recalled two years ago for floor
mats that can trap accelerator ped-
als and cause unintended accelera-
tion.
The problem centers on the
power window switch, which is
inside the driver's door and con-
trols when a window is opened or
closed. Toyota said grease wasn't
applied evenly to the switch dur-
ing production, causing friction
and sometimes smoke and fire.
NEW YORK
Could pepperoni

the next debate?
During the next presidential
debate, the candidates will be pon-
dering the important questions
of our time. But the most contro-
versial may be "Sausage or pep-
peroni?"
Pizza Hut is offering a life-
time of free pizza - one large pie
a week for 30 years - or a check
for $15,600 to anyone who poses
the question to either President
Barack Obama or Republican can-
didate Mitt Romney during the
live Town Hall-style debate next
Tuesday.
The proposed stunt, which the
pizza chain announced Tuesday,
is unlikely to happen because of
the strict rules that these types
 of debates typically follow. But if
it does occur, it threatens to tick
off millions of viewers who are
expected to tune in to the debate
to hear what the candidates have
to say about the economy, health
care and other serious concerns
facing this country.

2 U.S. scientists
win Nobel prize
in Chemistry
Two American researchers
won the Nobel Prize in chemistry
Wednesday for studies of protein
receptors that let body cells sense
and respond to outside signals like
danger or the flavor of food. Such
studies are key for developing bet-
ter drugs.
The Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences said Robert Lefkow-
 itz and Brian Kobilka had made
groundbreaking discoveries,
mainly in the 1980s, on an impor-
tant family of receptors, known as

G-protein-coupled receptors.
About half of all medications
act on these receptors, including
5 beta blockers and antihistamines,
so learning about them will help
scientists to come up with better
drugs.

Afghan offers
bounty for anti-

A religious cleric in western
Afghanistan said Wednesday he
is offering a $300,000 bounty to
anyone who kills the maker of an
anti-Islam film that has angered
Muslims aroundthe world.
Mir Farooq Hussini, a cleric
and the spokesman for an orga-
nization representing about 450
religious schools in Herat prov-
ince, made the latest bounty offer.
U.S. federal prosecutors said
Mark Basseley Youssef, 55, an
Egyptian-born Christian who
is now a U.S. citizen, is behind
the film, which portrays Islam's
Prophet Muhammad as a reli-
gious fraud, womanizer and child
molester.

CAMPUS PR OTFSIT
Students gather to support
affirmative action policies

North Campus
rally mirrors those
in Washington
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Calls for justice rang across
the North Campus Diag early
Wednesday afternoon, and
multi-colored "Diversity Mat-
ters" posters waved in the hands
of more than 40 students rallying
in support of affirmative action
policies.
At the same time, nearly 600
miles away in Washington D.C.,
the U.S. Supreme Court began
hearing oral arguments in Fisher
vs. University of Texas - a case
that could determine the fate of
race's role in the country's higher
education admissions processes.
Though outlawed in Michigan
since 2006, the University is no
stranger to the affirmative action
debate. In 2003, the University
was part of the two Supreme
Court cases, which eventually
established the current national
standards for the legitimate use
of race as an aspect in admissions
decisions.
Last week, the National
Black Law Students Association
reached out to the University's
BLSA chapter to help organize
a rally on campus to coincide
with the oral arguments in the
Supreme Court. BLSA rallies
occurred across the country on
Wednesday, including an event
held outside the Supreme Court
in Washington, D.C.
Law student Eric Jarrett, the
coordinator of the event, said
the cases involving the Univer-
sity and affirmative action make
the issue relevant to the campus

time. "A first lecture is necessar-
ily one that looks ahead. It is nec-
essarily one that takes us into the
future."
At the event Peterson said
while he had received many
awards, the Golden Apple -
which is given annually to a
student-nominated University
professor - was the most mean-
ingful to him.
Peterson's research focused
primarily on "character strengths
and how they pertain to such
outcomes as happiness, achieve-
ment and physical well-being,"
according to his University
profile. "Character Strengths
and Virtues," a book Peterson
co-authored, defines character
strengths as qualities that con-
tribute to the presence of six major
virtues in the human psyche.
VANDALISM
From Page 1A
the University's Asian/Pacific
Islander American Studies Pro-
gram.
Kurashige - whose office is
located in Haven Hall - wrote
in a statement to the Daily that
fliers hanging in the hall por-
traying issues of diversity had
been torn down in his depart-

ment. He said some of his col-
leagues working in fields such
as Arab American Studies,
Native American Studies, Afri-
can American Studies, Wom-
en's Studies, and LGBT studies
reported similar events.
Kurashige added that the
University should denounce
the vandalism out of respect to
these areas of study.
"It's important for the Uni-
versity to affirm that these
are vital and essential areas of
scholarship, while taking proac-
tive measures to make the valu-
able contributions of work done
in these fields accessible to all,"
Kurashige said.
He added that Gregory Dowd,
the chair of the Department of
American Culture, is collecting
information to "assess the over-
all impact" of the vandalism,
and Dowd has been in contact
with University officials.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University's

community.
"I think it's symbolic reason-
ing. It is particularly important
people come (to Ann Arbor)," Jar-
rett said.
On North Campus, a multitude
of guests spoke to students on the
merits of affirmative action and
the significance ofthe case. Many
referenced the civil rights move-
ment of the 1960s, indicating the
next step in fighting for equality.
Candace Moore, an NBLSA
Midwest attorney general, read
from Dr. Martin Luther King's
1968 speech "I See The Prom-
ised Land," in which, if given the
choice to inhabit the moments of
history's greatest triumphs, King
says he would choose the present.
Moore quoted King's words:
"But I know, somehow, that only
when it is dark enough, can you
see the stars. And I see God work-
ing in this period of the 20th cen-
tury in a way that men, in some
strange way, are responding -
something is happening in our
world."
Moore also reflected on King's
philosophy, calling for voices to
be raised in support of affirma-
tive action.
"There has never been a time
in history that did not possess its
own share of problems," Moore
said. "None but this one, because
as we stand here today, we recog-
nize the need for our voices to be
heard here in Michigan, over in
Washington, D.C. and through-
out this nation."
For many students, Jarrett
said, affirmative action is not only
a continuation of ongoing nation-
al debate, but also an aspect of
their everyday experiences in
higher education.
"For everybody in the class-
room, diversity is important and
not just in race. I think diversity
Caroline Miller, a gradu-
ate student who studied under
Peterson at the University of
Pennsylvania, said one of his
most well-known contributions
to psychology is the Values in
Action personality test, which
he co-authored with UPenn Prof.
Martin E.P. Seligman. The test,
which Miller said has now been
translated into several languages,
analyzes the character strengths
of individuals.
Miller fondly recalled the way
Peterson treated his students with
respect and optimism, noting that
he had a likable sense of humor.
"Chris Peterson didn't just
do research and teach research
about what makes for a good life,
he also role modeled it for us,"
Miller said. "'Other people mat-
ter' was his trademark phrase
and he was one of those unique
individuals who actually walked
the walk, didn't just talk the talk.
That is why his passing is having
Department of Public Safety
conducted a thorough inves-
tigation Wednesday morning,
but will continue to look into
the incident and determine an
appropriate response.
"Our understanding is that
their investigation determined
that the incident was not hate-
related," Fitzgerald said. "That
said, we certainly understand
that many people would still
be concerned about this type of

incident happening on our cam-
pus."
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said University police
canvassed departments
throughout Haven Hall after
reports of the vandalism, and
do not believe the alleged crime
constitutes a bias incident.
DPS reported in its incident
log that the act "did not appear
to be malicious as materials
were not strewn about."
Regardless of confirmation of
the crime, Frelier said she and
the other students turned out
to show their support and offer
messages of inclusion to their
classmates.
"The group of student's that's
here ... represents a group of
people who were, A, disturbed
by the vandalism that occurred
in this building last night, and
B, disappointed with the Uni-
versity's lack of response or lack
of addressing the vandalism,"
Frelier said.

and people from different per-
spectives adds to the learning
experience," Jarrett said.
Social Work student Priscilla
Cortez completed her under-
graduate degree at the University
of Texas, the school at the heart
of the current case. She said she
hopes the justices will consider
the effects of striking down affir-
mative action in highereducation
admissions.
"They know how this is going
to affect states like Texas and
Michigan," Cortez said. "It's
wrong. It would affect the coun-
try in a major way. For me it's like
a slap in the face. It's just a really
important issue. As a social work-
er, social justice is near and dear
to my heart."
Law student Brittany Nash
said she sees the issue as two
fold: first as an important step
in building equality and second
as a critical means for generat-
ing diverse classrooms in terms
of gender, hometown and other
characteristics.
"I believe that we still haven't
reached a point where it's abso-
lutely equal," Nash said. "There's
equal access and equal outcome.
Without affirmative action, maybe
everyone will have equal access,
but it won't be equal outcome."
Guest speaker Rev. David
Bullock of Greater St. Matthew
Baptist Church in Highland Park
echoed Nash's sentiments, and
said affirmative action is impor-
tant in increasing accessibility to
higher education.
"We want a fair shot, a fair
chance, and we want to level the
playing field. In order to do that
there needs to be criteria like
affirmative action in place so
that those who want educational
opportunitiescantake advantage
of them," he said.
such an incredible impact around
the world."
LSA junior Molly Martin, who
is currently enrolled in Peterson's
Psychology 476 course, said she
believes his legacy will continue
to inspire students.
"Professor Peterson would
put his heart into what he was
(doing), he was so unbelievably
present," Martin said. "The Uni-
versity has really lost someone
influential (who) can't be over-
looked."
According to Psychology
Today, Peterson was one of the
top 100 most-cited psychologists
in the world.
Peterson graduated from the
University of Colorado in 1976
with a doctorate emphasizing
social psychology, personality
psychology and animal learning.
He went on to complete his post-
doctoral training at UPenn from
1979 to 1981, and began work at
the University in 1986.
Frelier said the posters she
and the other GSIs created
display words of encourage-
ment from University students
against the reported vandalism.
"A lot of people who were
not able to come but wanted to
make their voices heard in some
capacity would give us a state-
ment that they wanted us to
hang for them," she said.
Rackham student Paige
Rafoth said she attended the

event because she believes the
alleged vandalism that trans-
pired was a hate crime targeted
at certain minority demograph-
ics at the University.
"The University needs to
share this information so that
the students know that it hap-
pened," Rafoth said. "It needs
to be addressed and denounced,
(and) in a timely manner too."
Rackham student Silvina Yi
said she too found out about the
vandalism through a Facebook
post and became distressed that
a potentially hate-related crime
could occur at a public institu-
tion "in this day and age."
"It made me want to send a
message of inclusion, and a mes-
sage of love and understanding
that this is a safe place and it
should be a safe place for every-
body," Yi said.

"The (Hathitrust program)

Baer wrote. "In addition, the
program helps Defendants pre-
serve their collections in the face
of normal deterioration during
circulation, natural disasters,
or other catastrophes that deci-
mate library collections, as well
as loss due to theft or misplace-

The Authors Guild, Inc., The
Writers' Union of Canada, the
Australian Society of Authors
and 12 individual authors filed
the suit against the University,
and other HathiTrust partici-
pant schools such as the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin and Indiana
University.
The judge wrote that the case
may set an important precedent
for future digital copyright laws,
noting there are comparatively
few prior standards regarding
digitization and its fair use.
"I cannot imagine a defini-
tion of fair use that would not
encompass the transformative
uses made by (the Hathitrust
program) and would require
that I terminate this invaluable
contribution to the progress of
science ... " Baer wrote.
When someone uses the
database to search a word in a
copyrighted book, the full text
is not available; only the page
number and number of occur-
rences in the book is shown.
The defendants claimed this
does not infringe on copyright
law because copyrighted books
cannot be read in their entirety
through the Hathitrust system.
The system is also used for
preserving physical texts in case
the originals are somehow lost
or destroyed. It already contains
nearly 10 million volumes and
about 73 percent of those are
copyrighted, the rulingstated.
In order to actually digi-
tize the works, the universi-
ties signed an agreement with

Google. The company is being
sued in a separate lawsuit by
the same plaintiffs for adding
parts of the scanned books to
its Google Books online service.
According to Wired Magazine,
the lawsuit with Google is ongo-
ing, and settlement talks are in
the works.
The Orphan Works Project
intended to allow full and free
access to books with indeter-
minable copyright information.
When the lawsuit was filed, the
program had not launched, and
in light of the lawsuit, the uni-
versities involved decided to
postpone its debut.
The judge wrote he could not
rule onthelegalityofthe Orphan
Works Project because it never
went into effect and is currently
undergoing evaluation.
If a student is blind, the stu-
dent is able to access all of the
books in the system beyond
only non-copyrighted works.
Baer said giving access to copy-
righted material for blind indi-
viduals was acceptable because
the Americans with Disabilities
Act allows libraries and other
institutions to create blind-
accessible copies of copyrighted
works.
Baer added that the digiti-
zation program did not eco-
nomically harm the plaintiffs
and that establishing a similar
commercial system would be
too expensive and not commer-
cially viable.
He also ruled that the plain-
tiffs had no legal standing to
sue, noting that the authors
associations and guilds could
not sue for copyright violations
on behalf of the authors who are
the actual copyright holders.
"(The plaintiffs) can win on
behalf of only themselves, but
can lose on behalf of their mem-
bers as well," Baer wrote.
In a tweet, Jeff MacKie-
Mason, the dean of the School

Affrm the future
College admission systems need a makeover
While students learn critical thinking skills in college class-
rooms, sometimes lessons learned outside the classroom are
just as important. College allows students from all walks of
life to participate in an arena in which their ideas and interests are broad-
ened by interactions with the larger campus community. This can best
be accomplished when that community is diverse in as many aspects as
possible. Affirmative action creates a diverse campus population while
providing underprivileged students and underrepresented minorities a
chance to partake in higher education for themselves. While affirmative
action currently does benefit individuals and society as a whole, the sys-
tem should encompass other factors in addition to race. While race still
should be considered in college admission systems, socio-economic status
and access to quality education should be more proactively emphasized.

Simply a band-aid

WASHINGTON, D.C. -
The dueling protest-
ers stood next to each
other on the
steps of the U.S.
Supreme Court.
He was one guy
versus 600 -
but Sarah want-
ed him to go.
"Come on,
why don't you
just leave?" she MELANIE
asked, clutching KRUVELIS
an "Equality for
All" sign in her
hand - one ofhundreds inthe crowd.
"What, free speech is only for you
guys?" the man replied. He held a
sign too. But unlike Sarah, his sign
read a little different than everyone
else's: "Affirmative action is dis-
crimination." And unlike Sarah, he
was alone.
Sarah turned away from her
group and stared at the guy point-
blank. "Don't you get it?" she said.
"Why do you think you don't have a
group with you today? Why do you
think you're alone?"
And there it was - the admission.
The admission of the rally's mental-
ity, this collective understanding
that if you weren't with us, you were
against us. And boy, were you wrong.
As the crowd grew outside of the
court's arguments for Fisher v. Uni-
versity of Texas, the case that may
end affirmative action outright,
it became increasingly clear that
there was simply no room for doubt.
The speakers got louder. The crowd
became more intense. But while the
chants of "Diversity works!" flooded
the intersection of First Street and
Maryland Avenue, you still have to
wonder: is the question "Does diver-
sity work?" what we really should be
asking? Or are we missing the point?
Like 21 percent of Americans,
according to a Rasmussen poll, I
found myself uncomfortably divided
on affirmative action. On one hand,
I wanted diversity - and not just
because college admissions essays
made me write about it until my
fingers fell off. After four years of
the same people in the same school
in the same town, I wanted to meet
people that were just a little differ-
ent.than the average white guy in
Royal Oak, Mich. And the University

seemed to care about that.
But on the other hand, I wasn't
sure if giving preference to some
people over others was the best way
to ensure a heterogeneous campus.
Fifty-five percent of Americans
oppose affirmative action accord-
ing to the same poll. It didn't seem
sustainable. Something about giv-
ing some preference to applicants
- whether it was for their race,
alumni connections, gender, what
have you - well, it felt incomplete.
Arbitrary, even - I mean, how do
you decide how many theoretic
points you get for playing the cello
versus being born in Hamtramck?
At its most basic, theoretic center,
it's a complicated pursuit. But it
seemed like we could do better.
And yet, at the rally, the discus-
sion never went there. Dozens of
speakers made their way to the podi-
um, singing the praises of diversity.
And it is absolutely worthy of praise.
The Supreme Court knows it, calling
diversity a "compelling interest" for
schools. University administrators
know it, devoting offices to oversee
its maintenance. Whether diversity
is important is not the question. But
somehow questioning the efficacy
of affirmative action, a policy that
hasn't uniformly helped low-income
students, is equated with holding an
anti-diversity agenda.
And it's not just an anti-diversity
agenda. When speakers approached
the subject of "the other" - those
who weren't in full support of affir-
mative action - the rhetoric often
turned red. Backward, Bible-beltian
red, in fact. "There are some that say
that affirmative action is a form of
reverse discrimination," said Brent
Wilkes, national executive director
of the League of United Latin Amer-
ican Citizens. "But you know what
those people support?voter ID laws.
Stop and frisk. The idea that only the
'47 percent' can move up."
Well, not necessarily. If the
three separate cases the court has
reviewed are any indication, affir-
mative action isn't exactly the easi-
est issue to tackle. A question that
requires such a comprehensive
understanding ofhistorical and phil-
osophical equality warrants more
thought than just guessing what
Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney would think and stick-

ing with that. For once, this isn't an
issue of red state v. blue state. So why
do we have to try to make it one?
Ensuring diversity in education
is an issue that is - and should be
- supported, regardless of political
ideology. Doubting the means cur-
rently used to reach this diversity,
however, is not the same as question-
ing the aims. Our current method,
namely, affirmative action, is just a
band-aid. Getting underprivileged
students into college - yes, it's
important. But it's not just aboutget-
ting them there.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments
on Wednesday in Fisher v. University of
Texas. A white student, Abigail Fisher, claims
the school denied her admission as a result of
its affirmative action system. According to the
plaintiff, in Texas there are two types of affir-
mative action at play. The first awards the top
10 percent of every high school with automat-
ic admission to the University and the second
gives a small advantage to students of racial
minorities who weren't in the top 10 percent.
In Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 landmark
case that involved the University of Michigan,
the court ruled that race could be used as part
of a holistic approach to admissions. In Fisher,
the justices will decide what, if any, role race
can play in admission decisions.
Race is not the only factor for a diverse college
campus, and it therefore should not be as highly
valued as socio-economic status and access to
quality education when making admission deci-
sions. The current system of affirmative action
limitsthe scope ofthe social good it could create.
While it's important to have a racially diverse
student body, it's also important to give under-
privileged students a chance to attend higher
education institutions. Affirmative action sys-
tems should also take economic background
stronglyinto account alongwith other factors.
Michigan has a long history with affirma-
tive action. Most recently, in 2006 Proposition

2 canceled the Supreme Court's Grutter rul-
ing by banning universities from considering
either race or gender when deciding admis-
sions. With many Michigan school districts
failing, it's important the University do its best
to allow socio-economic and racial minorities a
place duringthe admissionsprocess. The prob-
lem with the current system is that universi-
ties may admit minority students over students
with economic or educational disadvantages.
With about 80 percent of students coming
from households that make over $100,000,
diversity among students at the University is
not as prevalent as often advertised.
In 2003, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote in the majority opinion for
the Grutter decision, "We expect that 25 years
from now, the use of racial preferences will
no longer be necessary to further the interest
that we approve today." In 2028, hopefully we
will reach that point. However, today, there are
many social issues, both historical and current,
that must still be considered. Affirmative action
is the best option for the nation in order to reach
a just admissions process that furthers society
and educational institutions themselves. But
this process will only be fair if it considers all
disadvantaged applicants, and while race is
certainly a factor, it does not begin to convey
the inherent problems that disadvantaged stu-
dents face when applyingto college.

Affirmative
action is just one
possible solution.
It's about making sure they come
back for a second year. It's about
ensuring they make the grade. It's
about going back to elementary
schools and making sure kids learn
the multiplication table before they
leave. If we're trying to get at the root
of resolving educational disparities
once and for all, we've got to stop just
chopping away at the branches. All
we're left with is a pile of sticks, an
embarrassingly obvious metaphor
and a perpetually broken system.
When the Court announces its
decision in the spring, the court is
likely to rule in favor of Ms. Fisher,
meaning a restructuring or even the
destruction of affirmative action
programs. But this doesn't neces-
sitate the death of diversity. Affir-
mative action is just one possible
solution, one that has divided the
country for reasons beyond politics-
as-usual. It's time to consider alter-
natives. It won't be a jurisprudential
cakewalk (much to Justice Antonin
Scalia's disappointment). But hell,
affirmative action hasn't been either.
And unlike the Grutter decision,
maybe this time it won't come with
a 25-year sell-by date.

Jn 1992, President Bill Clinton famously
asserted that he "didn't inhale" nor had
he ever "broken a state law." By 2006,
not only was it known that
then first-time presidential
candidate Barack Obama had
inhaled, but that he had done
"maybe a little blow" too. In
2032, when most of us will
have surpassed the minimum
age to become president, and
are therefore qualified to hold SARAH
an important position in pub- ROHAN
lie office, I wonder what type
of personal inquiries people
will be making of our presidential candidates
- if any.
You see, when we are 40 years old, the land-
scape of those considered "qualified" to hold
important political positions will look very dif-
ferent than itdoes today, and certainly different
than it did in 1992. And this will likely be the
result of social media like Facebook and Twit-
ter, which not only expose, but also record and
preserve the often unwise antics of our youth.
There are more than 1-billion Facebook
monthly active users worldwide, 54 percent
of whom are under the age of 45. I'm confi-
dent that this percentage will grow, with more
young users creating profiles every day.
I've used Facebook for more than five years
before recently deleting it. Every single mes-
sage exchange, wall-to-wall conversation and
uploaded photo will be preserved on the web-
site whether I like it or not unless I go through
the process of deleting my account. This reality
applies to me and the 845-million other Face-
book users today.
When Ithink ofthe controversial statements
or past actions which are regularly entreated to
question the credibility of a political candidate,
I cringe to think of what could be used against
me or my peers in the future.
Because in the future, the allegations of
underage drinking or drug use won't be specu-
lative, they'll be concrete - in the Facebook
pictures which show our underage friend
drinking at a house party, in the conversation
with a college buddy where drug use is con-
firmed and in the offensive status we posted
at 3 a.m. one regrettable Thursday night. Even
if we attempt to delete the incriminating evi-
dence, there's always a risk that someone saved
them. And even if we deactivate our Facebook,
the account still remains intact in case we ever

change our minds.
While considering how Facebook mightalter
the field of future politics, it would be wrong
to ignore Twitter, which has fewer users than
Facebook - about 127 million - but remains
a ubiquitous engine in conveying our personal
thoughts or feelings. Twitter offers its users a
platform to express their views no matter how
vulgar, flawed, insignificant or regrettable they
may be - in 140 characters or less, of course.
And, like Facebook, Twitter canbe a dangerous
instrument of exposure and preservation.
In fact, Twitter has already proven instru-
mental in ruiningthe political career of at least
one politician, former Congressman Anthony
Weiner, and further injuring Sarah Palin's
political reputation. Even unintentional tweets
can cause controversy, such as when an account
linked to the National Rifle Association tweet-
ed, "Good morning, shooters. Happy Friday!
Weekend plans?"- the morning after the Auro-
ra, Col. shootingtook place this August.
If educated adults are making career-alter-
ing mistakes on social media sites, it's hard to
imagine the mistakes an unwitting teenager
makes on those same platforms - mistakes
which may very well come back to haunt them.
However, as unsettling as it is to know that
every thoughtless remark or action we've made
is preserved in virtual writing forever, we may
all take solace in one fact: each of our peers is in
the very same boat as we are.
By 2032, political figures most likely won't
come under fire for allegations of adolescent
law-breaking or politically incorrect state-
ments because I honestly don'tthink most of us
will judge the credentials of our policymakers
on the negligent behavior oftheir youth.
That's not to say that we shouldn't hold our
nation's leaders to a high degree of responsible
behavior. However, since we've grown up as
the "social-media generation," we're wholly
familiar with, if not already numb to, the types
of irresponsible behavior that might discredit a
future leader.
Despite the possibility that our expectations
of leaders by 2032 may be different than they
are currently, it remains important to expect
our leaders to display exemplary behavior in
the public eye, which starts with us displaying
that same behavior today. So fine, I'll take that
picture down.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - "Equal
Justice Under Law," says the veil -
more specifically, the canvas - that
obscures the U.S. Supreme Court
from public view. The canvas is part
of a "Marble Restoration Project"
that will soon restore the court's
faded fagade to its former glory. It
features a gigantic, life-size replica
of the court printed across it, from
seam to shining seam. From a dis-
tance, it almost looks like the real
thing. Almost.
On Oct. 10, the justices sat
behind the veil to hear both sides
of the Fisher v. University of Texas
case, punctuating the argument
with snarky interruptions. Most
were directed at the University of
Texas's embattled legal counsel,
Gregory M. Garre.
"Did they require everybody to
check a box or do they have some-
body figure out, 'Oh, this personlooks
1/32nd Hispanic and that's enough?"'
snarled Justice Antonin Scalia.
He's asking Garre about the sys-
tem usedby Texas college students to
self-identify race, which is, as it turns
out, a woefully inadequate way to
defend the effectiveness of the state's
affirmative action program.
Poor Garre - when he could get
a word in edgewise - had an even
tougher time nailing down the ETA
of his defendants' runaway train.
The end-goal of affirmative action
in Texas? The legal jargon used in
the court was "critical mass." It
refers to that glorious moment in
America's future - the Holy Grail
of integration - when minorities
are present in such "high numbers"
at universities that they no longer
contend with "racial isolation."
And Chief Justice John Roberts
brought the issue to its tipping
point within the first half-hour.
"What is the critical mass of
African Americans and Hispanics
at the university that you are work-

ing toward?" he asked Garre.
After a drawn-out, throaty gulp
you could hardly stage in Holly-
wood, Garre replied.
"Your Honor, we don't have one."
How can empirical terms like
"justice" and "the law" coex-
ist with a policy that aims to fix a
longstanding problem, but throws
around abstractions like "critical
mass" when proposing a solution?
Shorthand answer - they can't.
The rally in front of the court's
looming canvas didn't do much to
elucidate the issue further. Speak-
er after speaker used the term
"diversity" so liberally it may as
well have been a layman's buzz-
word for critical mass.
As the rally progressed in con-
junction with the proceedings in
the Court, I started to seriously
consider the possibility that the
whole affair was an exercise in
willed ignorance, a way for the
middle-aged and educated peo-
ple to pat themselves on the back
for finding a way to feign effort
without actually exerting any.
After all, Fisher's lawyer, Bert
Rein, made the valid point that
Texas's 10-percent plan - meant
to encourage diversity by draw-
ing from the top 10 percent of all
Texas public secondary schools -
simply encourages a system of de
facto segregation without fixing
the real problem.
The real problem starts way
before college.
A study cited by the conserva-
tive Heritage Foundation shows
that - even though educational
expenditures on elementary and
secondary school education have
increased 128 percent since 1970
when adjusted for inflation - "aca-
demic research has consistently
shown that increased spending
does not correlate with education-
al gains." So increased spending

on education doesn't work.
Dare I say that education doesn't
start in school, but at home?
But I don't need to rely on the
force of my own opinion. Sociolo-
gist Paul Amato from Pennsylvania
State University attributes the lack
of educational progress over the
past four decades to the breakdown
of the nuclear family.
As a social liberal, his figures left
me stricken with a case of cogni-
tive dissonance, but dammit, he's
right - across the board, children
in two-parent households are "less
disruptive," "have higher scores in
science and math" and "are more
likely to be engaged in their school-
work than peers in other family
structures." Furthermore, the ben-
efits of two-parent households on
"nine-year-olds' science and math
achievement appears to be cross-
national." Amato, for one, thinks
"the most profound change in the
American family" since 1970 has
been "the decline in the share of
children growing up in households
with biological parents."
Is it too inconvenient, too con-
servative for me to suggest that,
perhaps, the two-parent families
may be on to something here?
Like the hardworking men
and women who sweat over the
bottom-up reconstruction of the
Supreme Court's massive face,
advocates of racial and socioeco-
nomic equality, parents included,
would better serve their cause by
starting at the bottom, prepping
kids for college education before
their first glimpse of campus. Oth-
erwise, we'll spend the coming
decades staring at a pretty canvas,
superimposing the ugly scaffolds
of the longest construction project
in history.

Kennedy showed reserve but questioned both sides during oral
arguments without showing favoritism. He asked Fisher's
lawyer, Rein, about the usage of the program questioning his
statement that the plan admits few minorities, "I said, well, if
it's so few, then what's the problem?" After Garre, the Univer-

program, Kennedy commented, "So what you're saying is that

brought forth by Abigail Fisher,
a white Texan who was denied
admission to the University of
Texas, which uses race-based
admissions practices.
During questioning, Justice
Sonia Sotomayor laid out the cen-
tral question facing the court as
it decides whether race should be
considered in university admis-
sions.
"When do we stop deferring
to the university's judgment that
race is still necessary?" Sotomayor
said. "That's the bottom line of
this case."
In 2003, the Supreme Court
attempted to create a framework
that would allow higher educa-
tion institutions to use affirma-
tive action within certain bounds.
In Gratz v. Bollinger, the justices
determined that an automatic
awarding of points or preferential
admissions based solely on race
was unconstitutional.
However, in the companion
case, Grutter v. Bollinger, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her
majority opinion that race could
be considered on a holistic basis
with regard to how much an indi-
vidual could contribute to campus
diversity.
The University of Texas auto-
matically admits the top 10 per-
cent of graduates from each high
school in Texas. When admitting
students outside this top 10 per-
cent, the university uses race as
one of its consideration factors.

of Texas, which is defending its
admissions practices, faced criti-

ular vote in 2006, has been under
consideration in the federal
courts since last year. The case is
currently under deliberation by
the 15 judges of the U.S. 6th Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals.
If the nation's highest court
opts to overrule the precedents
at hand in Wednesday's case
- namely, Grutter v. Bollinger
- the verdict could render Pro-
posal 2 irrelevant, since the
consideration of race in college
admissions would be unconsti-

wide ban.

three of the court's conservative-
leaning members.
Bert Rein, Fisher's attorney,
said he didn't want the court to
overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, but
rather hopes to force the court to
better define how universities can
use race as a factor in admissions.
He argued that Texas' use of
affirmative action didn't meet
Grutter v. Bollinger's require-
ments because its 10 percent pol-
icy provided ample amounts of
diversity.
"You don't want to overrule
Grutter," Sotomayor said. "You
just want to gut it."
When Rein was asked by
Ginsberg about how the over-
all admissions system might be
considered and if the 10 percent
policy and admissions process for
the remainder be separated, Rein
pushed back.
"Well, I think that there would
be flaws under Grutter, even if you
assumed away something that
can't be assumed away, because
it is amatter of Texas law, that is,
there is a top 10 percent program,"
Rein said.
Ginsberg then responded to
Rein's obstinacy by saying the 10
percent policy itself is less radi-
cal than the University of Michi-
gan's Law School admissions plan
upheld by the court in 2003.'
"Well, then the question is can
you have both?" Ginsberg said.
"But it seems to me that this pro-
gram is certainly no more aggres-
sive than the one in Grutter. It's
more, in fact, more modest."
During Rein's testimony 'to
the court, the attorney pointedly
Bollinger - an outcome Univer-
sity professors and most experts
expect - that ruling could
alter the course of the Court of
Appeals' determination of Pro-
posal 2's constitutionality.
If Grutter is upheld, the Court
of Appeals might look more
favorably on the role of affirma-
tive action in college admissions,
according to Law Prof. Mark
Rosenbaum, who has argued in
favor of the Proposal 2 case and
affirmative action.
"If Grutter is not overruled,
it'll be a shot in the arm for our
side," Rosenbaum said.
In July 2011, opponents of
Proposal 2 - most notably By
Any Means Necessary, a pro-
affirmative action group that
brought the case to court -
earned a victory when a panel of
judges on the Court of Appeals

criticized the University of Texas'
handling of admissions targets for
minorities and the lack of trans-
parency on the issue. Rein placed
much of the blame on the lack of
definition provided in the Grutter
decision.
"They simply ignored it," Rein
said. "They just used words and
they said we've got to do more. So
they never answered the predi-
cate question which Grutter asks:
Absent the use of race, can we gen-
erate a critical mass?"
Justice Anthony Kennedy, con-
sidered the potential swingvote in
the case, didn't appear to tip his
hand during the debate, question-
ing both sides.
Kennedy challenged one of the
University of Texas' attorneys
after he argued that the school
wanted to consider race in admis-
sions in order to attract students
outside the top 10 percent of each
high school's graduating class.
"What you're saying is what
counts is race above all," Kennedy
said.
Garre, speaking after Rein's
opening argument, attempted to
reconcile the University of Texas'
10 percent policy and admis-
sion process for the remainder
of the seats with the Grutter rul-
ing. Much of the discussion was
focused on the definition of a
"critical mass."
Under Grutter, a goal of affir-
mative action policies is to ensure
minorities on college campuses do
not feel isolated and voiceless. The
critical mass refers to an unde-
fined proportion of students pro-
viding each minority group proper
integration and voice within the
larger campus community.
"Grutter said there has to be
ruled the amendment uncon-
stitutional by a 2-1 vote. At the
time, BAMN and its allies held a
press conference on the steps of
the Michigan Union to celebrate
the victory.
However, three weeks later,
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette announced an appeal
of the decision for the court to
review the case en banc - by the
court's 15 total judges. BAMN
and Schuette are awaiting the
verdict from the en bane hearing.
George Washington, a lawyer
who argued the case for BAMN
along with Rosenbaum, said
he expects a verdict from the
Court of Appeals in the next few
months. While he noted that he
is confident in a victory for affir-
mative action, he cautioned that
the verdict may still not be the
end of the fight over Proposal 2.

a logical end point to your use of
race." Roberts said. "What is the
logical end point? When will I
know that you've reached a criti-
cal mass?
When Garre failed to give Rob-
erts an objective measurement
of the critical mass a frustrated
Roberts demanded to know how
he was supposed to arrive at his
decision.
"How am I supposed to decide
whether you have an environment
within particular minorities who
don't feel isolated?" Roberts said.
"So, I see, when you tell me, 'that's
good enough."'
The final testimony from Solic-
tor General Donald Verrilli Jr., on
behalf of the U.S. government and
in favor of the University of Texas,
was also scrutinized by the con-
servative jurists.
"The core of our interest is in
ensuring that the nation's univer-
sities produce graduates who are
going to be effective citizens and
effective leaders in an increasingly
diverse society, and effective com-
petitors in diverse global markets,"
Verrilli said.
Scalia began questioning Ver-
rilli by creating a hypothetical
situation with two exactly equal
candidates of different races and
asking Verrilli whom he thought
would be admitted. Verrilli vacil-
lated on his answer, saying that
race would not be the deciding fac-
tor and that it operated more sub-
tly than an automatic preference
given to the minority student.
In a particularly telling
moment, Kennedy seemed to dis-
count Verrilli's argument for the
University of Texas' plan, though
this instance did not as clearly
define his opinion on the issue as
The Supreme Court may also
decide to hear the Proposal 2
case, he said.
If that happens, Washington
said precedent offered in Fish-
er v. University of Texas could
guide the court's judgment in a
possible Proposal 2 case, add-
ing the question would not be
whether affirmative action is
admissible, but whether a ban
on affirmative action by state
amendment is constitutional.
While the consensus seems to
be that the Grutter v. Bollinger
verdict will stand in some capac-
ity, Washington said that is "not
inevitable."
"A lot will be determined,"
Washington said, referringto the
climate after the Supreme Court
reaches its decision on Fisher v.
Texas, which will be announced
later this year.

did Roberts's, Scalia's and Alito's
statements.
"I thought that the whole point
is that sometimes race has to be a
tie-breaker and you are sayingthat
it isn't," Kennedy said. "Well, then,
we should just go away. Then we
should just say you can't use race,
don't worry about it."
In a brief moment of laughter
in the courtroom, Breyer mocked
Scalia's question with his own
largely rhetorical question for Ver-
rilli, implying Scalia's scenario was
ridiculous.
However, Breyer's answer stat-
ed that in his belief, the minority
candidate would then be preferred
on the basis of race, if all other
factors - like test scores, socio-
economic status and community
service participation - were the
same.
"If you have a situation where
those (and) all those things were
absolutely identical, than the per-
son would be admitted on the
bounds of race," Breyer said.
The court also discussed
whether or not Fisher had legiti-
mate grounds for suing the Uni-
versity of Texas for damages. Rein
argued that the failure of the col-
lege to afford her equal protection
under the law was in itself stand-
ing for the case. The court will
consider this matter during delib-
erations, but the decision will not
likely have a significant bearing on

the outcome.
The case is widely expected
to be a victory for Fisher in some
capacity. However, the way in
which she prevails will determine
the case's legacy in future consid-
erations.
Should the court rule that the
University of Texas exceeds its
mandate under Grutter v. Bol-
linger, and provides abetter defini-
tion for how diversity goals should
be achieved, affirmative action
will likely endure.
Still, it's possible that the con-
servative justices, who now domi-
nate the court, could overturn the
precedent set by Grutter v. Bol-
linger and completely eliminate
the consideration of race in college
admissions.
Further changing the composi-
tion of the court was Justice Elena
Kagan's decision to recuse herself
from the case, due to a conflict of
interest arising from working on
related issues during her time as
U.S. Solicitor General.
In the past, Justice Kagan has
typically voted with the liberal
side of the court, which makes the
University of Texas' case more dif-
ficult to win.
Should the court split 4-4, the
lower circuit court's decision that
the actions of the University of
Texas are legal under Grutter v.
Bollinger would stand, but would
not have any precedential value.

Turkey intercepts
Syrian plane as
tensions mount

Cargo confiscated
due to suspicions
that weapons may
be on board
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -
Turkish jets on Wednesday
forced a Syrian passenger plane
to land at Ankara airport on sus-
picion that it might be carrying
weapons or other militaryequip-
ment, amid heightened tensions
between Turkey and Syria that
have sparked fears of a wider
regional conflict.
The Syrian Air jetliner was
traveling from Moscow when
it was intercepted by F16 jets as
it entered Turkish airspace and
was escorted to the capital's
Esenboga Airport, the state-run
TRT television reported.
Hours later, Foreign Minister
Ahmet Davutoglu said the Air-
bus A320 with 37 passengers and
crew would be allowed to leave,
but its cargo had been confis-
cated.
"There areelements ...that are
not legitimate in civilian flights,"
the state-run Anadolu Agency
quoted Davutoglu as saying. He
did not provide details but said
authorities continued to exam-
ine the cargo.
Davutoglu earlier told Tur-
key's TGRT television that the
plane was intercepted on suspi-
cion it was carrying illicit cargo
to Damascus.
"If equipment is being carried
under the guise of civilian flights
or if they are not being declared,
then of course we'll inspect it,"
he said.
"We are determined to stop
the flow of weapons to a regime
that carries out such ruthless
massacres," Davutoglu added.
"We cannot accept that our air
space be used for such aims."
Hurriyetnewspaper's website,
citing unidentified intelligence
officials, said communications
equipment, wireless sets and
jammers were found on board.
NTV television reported that
authorities found "missile parts."

Syrian Information Minister
Omran Zuabi declined comment.
Davutoglu said Turkish
authorities had also declared
Syria's airspace to be unsafe and
were stopping Turkish aircraft
from flying over the civil war-
torn country.
The move comes as tensions
between Turkey and Syria are
running high. The countries,
which were once close allies,
have been exchanging artillery
fire across the volatile border for
days.
Earlier Wednesday, Turkey's
military chief vowed to respond
with more force to any further
shelling from Syria, keeping
up the pressure on its southern
neighbor a day after NATO said
it stood readyto defend Turkey.
Gen. Necdet Ozel was inspect-
ing troops who have been put
on alert along the 565-mile
(910-kilometer) border after
shelling fror Syria killed five
Turkish civilians in a border
town last week. Turkey has rein-
forced the border with artillery
and also deployed more fighter
jets to an air base close to the
border region.
"We responded and if (the
shelling) continues, we will
respond with more force," the
private Dogan news agency
quoted Ozel as saying during a
visit to the town of Akcakale.
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta said Wednesday that
Washington has sent troops to
the Jordan-Syria border to help
build a headquarters in Jordan
and bolster that country's mili-
tary capabilities in the event that
violence escalates along its bor-
der with Syria.
The revelation raises the pos-
sibility of an escalation in the
U.S. military involvement in the
conflict, even as Washington
pushes back on any suggestion of
a direct intervention in Syria.
In Syria's largest city, Aleppo,
regime troops and rebel fight-
ers exchanged fire for several
hours in and around the his-
toric 13th-century Umayyad
Mosque, said local activist
Mohammed Saeed.

me today understand that it takes
two to fight," Joe said. "In 2003,
with the case at the Univer-
sity of Michigan,(BAMN) orga-
nized 60,000 students and they
marched and the Supreme Court
ruled in our favor and I think we
can do that again."
Kate Stenvig, a University alum
and the BAMN college organizer,
said she came to the event with
six other members of the organi-
zation to watch the case and show
their commitment to furthering
affirmative action.
"I think students from Michi-
gan lead the fight to defend affir-
mative action," Stenvig said. "I
think the same thing is true today,
whatever the outcome of the legal
case is we are going to continue
to fight in the court and to build a
new civil rights movement."
Though the majority of people
gathered at the Supreme Court
were in support of the University
of Texas, supporters of Abigail
Fisher also rallied in opposition
to affirmative action.
Frank Lukas, a graduate of
the University of Maryland Law
School and the father of two chil-
dren who went through the col-
lege admissions process, came to
the court bearing signs question-
ing the effectiveness and consti-
tutionality of affirmative action.
He was joined by D.A. Hess, a
local resident who supported
Lukas's cause.
"I'm just a person in favor of
real fairness," Hess said. "I just
think we need to live in a world
where people are judged by their
merits and not the color of their
skin."
Lukas said he feels strongly
about ending affirmative action
because he believes it negatively
impacted his daughter's college
admission.
"My daughter had a 750 on
each of the three sections of her
SAT Is and her SAT II, and was
rejected by every Ivy League,"
Lukas said. "She was number one
in her class. She was valedicto-
rian, and I don't want to say that
other people who were less quali-
fied got in, but people who were
less qualified got in."
Lukas said his daughter ended
up graduating from a public col-
lege in 2008 and is now applying
to medical school, adding that he
is concerned about her applica-
tion process because the schools
she applied to have all use affir-
mative action in the admissions
process.
Hess echoed Lukas's senti-
ments and said he is particularly
bothered by affirmative action
in medical programs because it
could mean less qualified doctors
are practicing.
"Your mother could be on the
hospital bed dying of cancer, and
the person who is there trying
to save her life could be a person
who did not get there based on
their merit, and that scares me,"
Hess said.
Lukas and Hess appeared to
be the only attendees in opposi-
tion of affirmative action on the
steps of the Supreme Court, and
according to Lukas, who came
protest against Grutter v. Bol-
linger and Gratz v. Bollinger in
2003, the turn out for those in
favor of ending affirmative action
was not much different.
"I'm just here because I have
the signs from a decade ago and
thought I'd use them again,"

Lukas said.

Wolverines open with RIT

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
When the No. 3 Michigan
* hockey team opens up its season
against the Rochester Institute
of Technology on Thursday,
the Wolverines will be without
junior defenseman Jon Merrill.
Merrill was checked into the
boards during Tuesday's exhi-
bition versus

There is no
timetable on
Merrill's return, but a hopeful
estimate from similar injuries in
the past is six weeks.
With or without Merrill, the
Wolverines face a Tigers team
that they've never faced in the
history of the program. The
unknown sometimes can pose
problems for teams in prepa-
ration, especially consider-
ing Michigan only has one day
between games.
But Berenson has never put too
much stock in watching opposing
team's film. Michigan is usually
ready for any style of play.
"(Berenson's) always been a
guy who's said 'control what you
can control,' " said senior for-
ward A.J. Treais. "We don't real-
ly have to worry about (opposing
teams) as much as we have to
worry about us.
"If we show up and play our
game, he thinks we have a good
chance to win. If we're worrying
about the other team than that's a
little bit different."

of juniors Kevin Clare and Mac
Bennett will be split up - Clare

Trouba and Bennett will pair
with sophomore Mike Chiasson.
Along with the unanticipated
roster changes, the Wolverines
have waited patiently for one of
the four goalies on the roster to
separate themselves from the
rest of the pack. The gradua-
tion of netminder Shawn Hun-
wick last year left a gaping hole
in the position, but Berenson
announced freshman Jared Rut-
ledge as the starting goalie for
Thursday's game with freshman
Steve Racine backing him up.
Rutledge started in net for
the United States National Team
Development Program last year,
where he compiled a 17-8-4
record and a .904 save percent-
age. Behind both freshmen is
junior Adam Janecyk, who saw
limited playing time last season.
"We have two solid goalies
that can play, even three," Treais

said. "It's good to have trust in
your goalie and I think we've
established that with our two
guys. They're both quiet, steady
goalies. They don't really ask
much of us. They're just out there
to stop the puck and that's what
we need."
RIT became a Division I pro-
gramin 2005, which is likely why
the two sides have never played.
The Tigers play in the Atlantic
Hockey Association, and last
year, despite missing the NCAA
Tournament, they did manage to
defeat CCHA winner Ferris State
and Lake Superior State during
the regular season.
But despite the youth of the
Tigers program, Berenson still
sees them as a potential threat.
He said that Michigan would
watch a little bit film after prac-
tice on Wednesday, but that
would be the extent in the scout-
ing.
"(RIT is) well coached,"
Berenson said. "They've got a
good coaching staff who does
a good job with the team and

they'll be a good opponent."
One thing which the Wolver-
ines will need to work on before
Thursday is the performance of
their special teams. The penalty
kill gave up two power play goals
on five attempts against Wind-
sor - well below last season's
84.2 percent success rate. But the
power play was successful, scor-
ing on three of seven attempts
compared to last year's 13.3 per-
cent.
The power play will likely be a
factor on Thursday as the Tigers'
84.7 penalty kill percentage was
good enough for loth nation-
ally last year. When asked about
what would need to change from
Tuesday's exhibition, Berenson
had a clear answer.
"We have to forecheck well,"
he said. "We have to back-check
better than we did (Tuesday).We
have to be better on the special
teams. ... I think we can be bet-
ter, just in a nut shell. We can be
better with the puck and better
without the puck, no matter who
we play."

teams have a
good game and there are no inju-
ries," Berenson said. "We just
have to look forward and say 'It's
unfortunate (but) it could have
been worse.' ... Our whole team
has to pick up the slack."
Though Berenson didn't get
his pregame wish, Berenson did
call the hit delivered on Merrill
a "clean" one. On the play, Mer-
rill possessed the puck a few
feet from the boards, shielding it
from the forechecker.
The hit on Merrill, combined
with the space between him and
the boards, allowed him to fall
to the ice and then awkwardly
collide with the end boards.
Berenson said if it weren't for
the distance from the boards, it
would have been a "simple" col-
lision.

dent in the new
units.
"We're going to move (senior
forward A.J. Treais) back to the
point," Berenson said of the pow-
er-play unit. "I like both units.
We worked on them a little bit
again (Wednesday)."
This will be the second time
that Merrill has missed signifi-
cant time in the first half of the
season. Last year, a suspension
for an undisclosed violation of
team rules benched the former
United States National Team
Development Program standout
for the entire first half.
In the 19 games Merrill, a New
Jersey Devils' draft pick, did play
last season, he recorded 11 points
and a plus-11 plus/minus rating,
which equaled his total from the
year before.


WOMEN'S BA SKTBALL
Ristowski ready
*to shine for Blue

Freshman class unveiled

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Meet Madison Ristovski.
Perhaps you already know her.
Maybe you know her as the top-
rated basketball player in the state
of Michigan for the class of 2012,
or maybe you know her as the
most recent Michigan Miss Bas-
ketball Award winner. Or maybe
you're way ahead of the game and,
you knowshe is a freshmanguard
competing for Michigan's starting
point guard position.
Now it's time -to know her as a
Wolverine.
Ristovski may only be a week
into practice, but she hasn't let her
inexperience hold her back.
"College basketball is not at all
like high school," Ristovski said.
"The game's faster, the players
are stronger, everyone's IQs (are)
higher, so transitioning took a
little while, but I think I'm finally
getting used to what the game is
like now."
Ristovski's transition might
seem like it lasted only a week
because of her rave reviews, but
her success is a product of her
commitment and hard work. She
dedicated her summer to speed-
ing up the learning curve, so that
she could hit the ground running
in the fall. No stranger to hard
work, Ristovski spent her summer
vacation giving the game every-
thing she had before the start of
classes.
"Being here all summer defi-
nitely helped out because I was
able to see more game experience
with an open gym," Ristovski
said. "I want to do everything I
can and work as hard as I can to
help my team out (because) it's
not about me, it's about the team."
But game experience wasn't
the only thing the freshman
guard spent her summer working
on. Conditioning became the cen-
tral point of Ristovski's offseason
program, and it's already clear
that the extra time she put in at
the gym has paid off.
"Conditioning is a major, major

adjustment for the freshman,
but she has been one of the first,
if not the first, in sprints," said
first-year Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico. "Physically she is
a lot stronger than I thought she
would be, and she has been one of
the most impressive players we've
had in practice."
Added Ristovski: "I think that
if you play college basketball
you're going to have to be in the
best shape that you cdn possibly
be in. Coming in I knew that (con-
ditioning) was my weakest link
(and) that I had to keep working
on (it)."
Ristovski, however, had no idea
what Barnes Arico had in mind.
With a new coach and system in
place, the pace of practice was
unlike anything any of the players
had ever been a part of.
"After our first day of practice
we ran alot," Ristovski said. "And
after practice was over I called my
dad and I said, 'Dad, that's why
they call that college basketball."'
But Ristovski didn't let the pace
overwhelm her or let her success
during the first week make her
complacent. Unlike many other
past Miss Basketball winners,
Ristovski isn't done developing
her game.
"Winning Miss Basketball was
pretty important to me, but at the
same time I wasn't going to let
that title define what kind of play-
er I am," she said.
In fact, she has consistently
worked on getting better. Over
the last week it hasn't just been
her play and work ethic that's
stood out, but also her leadership
presence on the court.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan - one
of the team's leaders - has found
many similarities in Ristovski's
personality and approach to the
game.
"I see a lot of myself in Madi-
son," Ryan said. "She's very
intense and driven and I think
she's really come into the system
and done phenomenally well for
the first few practices we've had.
The sky's the limit for Madison."

They're here.
The Michigan basketball
team's best recruiting class since
the Fab Five has arrived with
plenty of fanfare, and though it
will be a few weeks before fans
get a taste of the newest prod-
uct, Michigan Media Day offered
some hints as to what the team
could look like come November.
Mitch McGary, Glenn Robin-
son III and Nik Stauskas head-
line the freshman class, which
also includes Spike Albrecht and
Caris LeVert. With the Wolver-
ines holding an open tryout for
the last roster spot, Michigan
could see six freshmen on its
roster by the time Slippery Rock
comes to Crisler Center for the
season opener on Nov. 9.
"They've come in here and
picked up the offense pretty
quickly, even though the coaches
are only showing a glimpse of
what it will be," said senior guard
Josh Bartelstein. "You casu-
ally bring the offense in and just
teach the basics right now. They
can just start playing and not
think about all the things they've
got to do for now."
Though the freshmen have
strong pedigrees from their high
school, prep school and AAU
careers, the only firm indica-
tion of where any of them would
figure into the offense was that
Albrecht would be a backup point
guard behind sophomore Trey
Burke. The Crown Point, Ind.
native is a welcome addition for
Michigan coach John Beilein, as
the Wolverines haven't had a true
point guard to back up the starter
the last two seasons.
Robinson III, the 11th-ranked
recruit in the country according
to Rivals.com, indicated that he
was seeing time at both the "3"
and the "4," though he'd also feel
comfortable at the "2." McGary
- 30th-ranked recruit - said he
was working out in the post and
as a "4" away from the basket.
Stauskas and LeVert have been
spendingtime on the wings.
It isn't just the talent level of
the competition that takes get-

ting used to, but also the lifestyle
of a college basketball player.
"It's a lot different coming
from high school to here, but
that's something you have to
get used to, and that's another
advantage of coming here dur-
ing the summer," Robinson III
said. "I'm starting to get used
to everything that's going on,
the schedule that we have to go
through daily."
With so many youngsters,
there has to be someone around
to show them how things are
done.
After living with Zack Novak
and Stu Douglass last year, Bar-
telstein said that he learned a lot
about leadership and has taken
clues for what to do and what not
to do when teaching underclass-
men about the culture at Michi-
gan.
Beilein pointed outhow junior
forward Tim Hardaway Jr. has
become more like Novak by mak-
ing sure his voice is heard con-
stantly throughout practice.
"There hasn't been any push-
back of, 'Well I'm used to doing
this, how come I have to do that
now?' " Beilein said. "For exam-

ple, 'I was sort of open, the next
guy was more open, why do I
have to pass it to himwhen I have
done this my whole life?' They
have just said, 'Okay, if that's
what we do, that's what we do."'
Sometimes, the leadership is
more position-specific.
The six-foot-ten McGary said
redshirt junior Jordan Morgan
and redshirt sophomore Jon
Horford have taken him under
his wing, and showed him some
of the intricacies of post play.
"We had a great moment yes-
terday," Beilein said. "We got
done with practice, it was the end
of our preseason and we had Josh
Bartelstein, Corey Person and
Eso Akunne - three guys that
very rarely play - all had fresh-
men pulled out to the side saying
'Okay, this is exactly what we're
just talking about, you can do
this.' It was really a good moment
for me."
Whereas the veterans are tak-
ing up the leadership void left
by the graduation of Novak and
Douglass, the freshmen willhave
to take up some of the responsi-
bility for replacing the lost stats.
With the departures of the two

seniors, along with the transfer
of forward Evan Smotrycz to
Maryland, Michigan must find a
way to replace nearly 24 points
and 12 rebounds per game.
Robinson, McGary and Staus-
kas are expected to shoulder a
good portion of that load.
Stauskas's teammates spoke
highly of his ability to shoot from
outside, while Beilein said that
he also has the versatility to take
a defender off the dribble and get
to a desired spot on the court.
But if Stauskas's words hold
true, there could be a lesser-
known freshman making an
impact - one who wasn't added
to the recruiting class until the
2011-12 season had been long
over.
"The only surprise I've seen so
far is Caris Levert. I had heard
nothing about him coming in
here, so I didn't really know what
his game was like, but he's a heck
of a player," Stauskas said. "He's a
scorer. He can put the ball on the
floor, he can shoot, he can pass.
He's super shifty. We actually
compared him to Jamal Craw-
ford, so you guys better watch
out for him."

set to honor Colts' Pagano

While Chuck Pagano lies in a
hospital bed at the Indiana Uni-
versity Simon Cancer Center
in Indianapolis in a battle for
his life, the Michigan football
coaching staff will offer every
bit of support it can.
Pagano, the
first-year head NOTEBOOK
coach of the
Indianapolis Colts, was diag-
nosed with acute promyelocytic
leukemia and has been hospital-
ized since Sept. 26.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
and his staff purchased 40
#chuckstrong T-shirts and will
wear them to Michigan Stadium
for the Wolverines' matchup
against Illinois on Saturday.
Several members of the staff
have ties with Pagano and his
family. Pagano worked for
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison when Mattison was
with the Baltimore Ravens.
Hoke and the members of the
staff that came from San Diego
State knew Pagano's brother,
John, a defensive coordinator
with the San Diego Chargers,
rather well.
"There's a strong relation-
ship," Hoke said Wednesday.
"He's one of ours. He's our kind
of guy. So we want to pay a little
tribute to him and also for the
cause."
Hoke said he made the deci-
sion to do the #chuckstrong
tribute on Sunday night, which
was the same evening Pagano's
Colts upset the Green Bay Pack-
ers, 30-27, in Indianapolis.

Daily Sports Writer
Locked in an intense overtime
match against a bitter rival, an
unlikely hero stepped up for the
No. 21 Michigan women's soccer
team.
With just 46 seconds remain-
ing in the first extra period, senior
midfield-
er Emily MICH. STATE 1
Jaffe's first MICHIGAN 2
career goal
was the difference in the Wolver-
ines' 2-1 victory over Michigan
State at the U-M Soccer Complex
Wednesday night.
Jaffe, who transferred to Mich-
igan from Iowa in 2010, made
the most of her nine minutes on
Wednesday night. Subbing in at
the beginning of overtime, she
provided a boost to a beleaguered
squad. The 5-foot-6 senior was in
perfect position on a corner kick,
as her header bounced slowly
towards goal, somehow making
its way past a defender and the
Spartans' goalkeeper. The goal
ended the game, the Wolverines'
bench emptied and the entire
team mobbed Jaffe near the
18-yard box in celebration of their
first win over Michigan State
since 2003.
Exuberant after giving Michi-
gan (6-0-1 Big Ten, 12-2-1 overall)
the dramatic win, Jaffe couldn't
suppress a smile as she described
her emotions.

"This is a huge win," she said.
"It's just the next step to winning
the Big Ten championship."
With the win, the Wolverines
moved past No. 4 Penn State for
first place in the conference. The
Nittany Lions (6-0, 12-2) play at
Nebraska on Friday. The victory
also improved Michigan's unde-
feated streak to nine games, set-
ting a new program record.
Though the Spartans (2-4-1,
8-5-2) took only one shot on tar-
get in the first half, forward Paige
Wester capitalized on the oppor-
tunity. Forward Olivia Stander
drove a chest-high cross into the
box in the 29th minute, and an
unmarked Wester deftly headed
the ball towards goal. The short-
range misdirection gave fifth-
year senior goalkeeper Haley
Kopmeyer little time to react, and
the shot found the back of the net.
It was the first time the Wol-
verines were behind in a game
since Sept. 2 at then-No. 11 Long
Beach State.
But Michigan didn't trail for
long. Following a slew of offen-
sive chances, junior forward
Shelby Chambers-Garcia took
Michigan's second corner kick
in under a minute. The right-
footed cross curled toward the
front post, and Michigan State
goalkeeper Clem Courtney's
punch came just after the ball had
crossed the end line.
Following the goal, the Wol-
verines and Spartans traded

scoring chances until the end of
regulation. In the 57th minute,
Michigan forward Corinne Har-
ris shot a laser from 18-yards out
that rattled the underside of the
crossbar. The Wolverines raised
their arms in celebration, but the
referees ruled that the ball never
fully entered the net.
With just two minutes left
in regulation, Stander missed a
sure game-winning goal for the
Spartans. After midfielder Megan
Marsack drew a pair of Michigan
defenders towards her, she found
Stander wide open inside the
18-yard box. But Stander's cross-
ing shot missed the goalpost by
inches, and the game remained
deadlocked.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan has
been impressed with his defend-
ers all season, but Saturday's
performance left something to
be desired. They repeatedly left
Spartan attackers unmarked and
allowed 15 shots and numerous
breakaways.
"When you make mistakes like
this it makes;you better," Ryan
said. "It's nice we didn't lose the
game because of it."
After the midweek game, the
Wolverines have a short turn-
around before hosting Purdue on
Sunday. Ryan is confident that
Michigan will be prepared, but
he's hoping for a less stressful
game.
"I'm too old for this," he said
with a laugh.

Blue bullies Illinois at home

nois junior
libero Jennifer Beltran was
forced to move out of the way to
protect her face as the ball rock-
eted towards the court.
It was frightening to be on the
opposing end of the Michigan vol-
leyball team's 25-16, 25-19, 26-24
straight-set win on Wednesday
night.
You wouldn't have expected it,
though, knowing the Wolverines
were on a three-game skid, had
only one day of practice between
games and were implementing a
new offensive system.
But Michigan played with a
conviction that it had been lack-
ing during its losing streak, post-
ing a .304 attacking percentage
with three players accumulating
double-digit kills, as well as 52
digs and 10 team blocks.
"We know we have talent and
we know we have the ability to
play," said Michigan coach Mark
Rosen. "Tonight we executed
extremely well in every facet of
the game. That's the key to any
sport - you have to execute."
It helped that the 22nd-
ranked Fighting Illini commit-
ted 30 errors during the game
and were only able to manage a
.188 attacking percentage.
The Wolverines worked their
way to an 8-5 run to begin the
first set, and following a kill

w
s

from junior middle blocker Jen-
nifer Cross, they went on a short
3-0 run to force Illinois to take a
timeout. Illinois would take the
next three points, but couldn't
hang on as it watched the 5-0
rally crush any hope of a come-
back.
Michigan totaled a strong .398
attack percentage in the first set,
overpowering the Fighting Illi-
ni, who hit just .029.
Michigan also incorporated
an unusual offense into Wednes-
day's game, using a three-hit-
ter system in which the setter,
Dannemiller, had three pass-
ing options. At times, the attack
caught the Fighting Illini off
guard, especially when Cross
was positioned at right-side hit-
ter.
Cross's new position resulted
in 14 kills and nine blocks, as
well as a season-high seven digs.
"I've kind of been waiting for
myself to do that all season,"
Cross said.
A much bleaker outcome
I

seemed likely in the third set
as the Wolverines quickly fell
behind 10-7. A consistent and
unwavering Michigan team
fought back, though, to take a
21-20 lead on another of Erwin's
12 kills.
Junior outside defensive spe-
cialist Ally Sabol led what looked
like a new defense with 17 digs,
while Dannemiller posted a
team-high 37 assists.
The Wolverines finally had a
chance to play at home after four
straight games on the road.
But that doesn't mean they
slept.
"I pulled my first all-nighter
because I had to," Cross said
after arriving back from the
team's visit to Wisconsin. "(I
was) with Lexi Danamiller in the
fishbowl the other night after we
got home from the game. We
haven't really had time to prac-
tice really."
There's no telling how fright-
ening the team will look with
consecutive days of practice.

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"All I Want is Everything"
In the third novel of Cecily Von Ziegesar's best-
selling series "Gossip Girl" - which the CW drama
of the same name is based upon - Serena van der
Woodsen and Blair Waldorf have made nice for the
sake of a merry Christmas and a glamorous New
Year. Full of vacation troubles and delicious make-
up, break-up drama, "All I Want Is Everything"
-> lives up to its name.
LITTLE, BROWN AN COMPANY
Habits & Contradictions
- Schoolboy Q
With the uninhibited abandon of a mixtape but
the top-notch production value of a studio album,
Schoolboy Q's second full-length release is a loose-
limbed and versatile work that further solidifies
Q as a rising rap star. He's much stronger than the
various guest spots throughout the album, but Hab-
its & Contradictions is an impressive hip-hop proj-
TOP DAWG c in Qs signature dark, intense voice.
"Singin' in the Rain"
"'Pitch Perfect" might be the current musical
sensation, but let's take it all the way back to 1952,
r when the best musical ever made - and one of the
greatest films of all time - hit the theaters. "Singin'
in the Rain" splash of colorful music, spectacle
and the ever-charismatic Gene Kelly is at his abso-
Ay .lute best. It's a moviethat willnever failto wrap you
J in aglorious feeling.
METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER
"The League"
Yes, the NFL is in full swing and fantasy foot-
ball has turned many the fan into a strung-out
wreck. But surprisingly, the faux-sport is a lot ...
funnier... than one would expect. "The League,"
entering its fourth season tonight, is a side-split-
ting, semi-improvised comedy about a close group
of friends - and how they sabotage one another
for fantasy glory.

"Ludo Bites" follows the
stories of celebrity cook Ludo
Lefebvre, described by Anthony
Bourdain as being "dangerous"
and by Sam Sifton as having
narcotic food. Neither of these
men miss the mark - Ludo is a
notorious and ruthless cannibal
and murderer, known as well for
his cuisine as for his drug-laced
creme brulde.
On the cover, we see his
prized bracelet made of tinted
human teeth while he carefully
sets greens upon fileted human
rump steak.
Ludo constantly must go from
town to town across America,
making "pop-up restaurants"
as he channels "Sweeney Todd,"
luring curious passersby in with
the promise of food before drug-

ging them and turning them into
his next dish.
His entertainment lawyer
wife, Kristine, mediates any and
all legal disputes pertaining to
his unsightly habits, allowing
him to roam from California to
New York and gain the praise of
critics and cultists alike.
Most recipes use code like
"foie gras" and "Gruyere" for
"human fatty liver" and "eye-
balls."
Well-written, with gleeful
descriptions of deception and
decapitation, Ludo's murder
memoir disguised as a run-of-
the-mill cookbook may leave you
wondering what you're being
served next time you hit Five
Guys.

ed by the latest electronics and
modern amenities," Oyobe writes
in the artist's book.
It's something to think about
next time you get excited for the
new iPhone.
"I like the way they don't shy
away from the bigger, hot topics
these days," Oyobe said. "Their
subjects are right at the forefront
of social issues and we became
interested in them, not only
because they are breaking sub-
stantial new ground in digital art,
but because their art really reso-
nates with college students."
Visibility and accessibility
For their UMMA show,
YHCHI has installed a two-chan-
nel set of pieces, fully titled "Isn't
it the Greatest in the World? Part
1: What to Do Good? Know How
to Shoot a Semi-Automatic Weap-
on," which operates in rhythm on
projected walls and on stacked
monitors. The piece exudes the
coy wit and social probing of their
art, but also translates their artis-
tic form into a gallery space.
"Most shows are a little bit
difficult to curate in the Irving
Stenn, Jr., Family Project Gallery
because there is little way to con-
trol lighting," Oyobe said. "And
we could have used other spaces
in the museum, but I was ada-
mant that it needed to be in this
gallery - it had to be visible to the
students."
Oyobe explained that one way
UMMA makes the show more
visible to students is by running
it during the night, which began
Oct. 1. This way, the giant pro-
jections on the gallery walls and
six widescreen television screens
are visible to anyone on the
State Street lawn. If they could
pump the music outside, Oyobe
explained, pedestrians would get
the full gallery experience as they
passed by.
That essential accessibility of
YHCHI's work has been as vital to
the context of their form as their
subtle irony is to their subject
matter. It's hard to consider now
how unorthodox it was in 1999 to
upload art solely for dissemina-
tion over the Internet. Keeping in
mind those were the days of dial-
up, AOL and Netscape, creating a
space where anyone with a phone
line and modem could go watch a
full piece of art - music and all -
online was unheard of. It was the
digitalization of the gallery.
Imagine the potential this shift
has for the viewer, especially
the college student. Rather than
expensivelytravelingto amuseum
or site of history, the work exists
wholly wherever it is viewed. It
opens the potential for collabo-

ration, sharing and exposure on
a level previously unimaginable.
And without the infrastructure of
the old art world, traditional dis-
courses on originality or authen-
ticity become muted.
Behindthe enigmas
Conversely, another key aspect
of YHCHI's art is that it lacks
interactivity and the viewer is
intentionally blocked from any
two-way dialogue. You can't stop
it, you can't rewind it, all you can
do is watch and listen. Even the
artists, who declined to comment
for this article, are careful to con-
ceal themselves, making them
high-profile enigmas in the art
world.
Oyobe explained that this
denial of interaction between
the artist and audience is often
heightened in the gallery setting.
"Actually, in an exhibition in
L.A., they tilted all the screens
and projection, which was not
warmly received," Oyobe said.
"We expect to be accommodated
when we see something in a gal-
lery, and YHCHI, with their sly
humor, know it."
And this negative reaction to
the show and outcry itself showed
what YHCHI was driving at: Con-
sumers and viewers still have the
power to resist and say, "no."
In addition to an expansion of
the ways in which YHCHI's work
is presented spatially, they have
also begun experimenting with
ways of presenting their text. One
clear example of this growth in
their UMMA work is the back-
drop of the American flag the text
is placed on.
"The flag, which is reminiscent
of Jasper John's 'Three Flags,'
forces you to read each line of text
against the mixed signals of the
American identity," Oyobe said.
"At times it's patriotic, but tinged
with doubt and sometimes it just
looks like a symbol of decline -
you read its meaning from the
poetry, but you can't read the
poetry the same without it."
On a semantic level, YHCHI's
poetic style blends different dis-
courses to create a single strand
of assembled pieces. Oyobe
explained that "they adopt a
number of discursive models:
monologue, dialogue, personal
letters, speeches, prose, novels,
poems, journalism and chat-
room posts and responses," and
combine them with appropriated
and original jazz, percussion and
orchestral arrangements to create
a single progression.
"They really believe that any
form can be manipulated as art,"
Oyobe said. "For example, in our
show they present a parody of
spam mail - one of the African
prince money scams. Within the
context of the work though, the
letter isn't asking for money as

much as it's asking for commit-
ment."
Enteringthe art world
Along with the gallery show,
which will run until Dec. 30,
Oyobe and YHCHI also col-
laborated on an innovative art-
ist's book, which was published
through UMMA and serves as the
companion piece to the show.
"They're usually against mak-
ing a traditional exhibition cata-
logue," Oyobe said. "This is only
their second attempt at an artist's
book and, although I wrote the
essay, the book is their aesthetic,
and their work."
The book itself - white, bound
and simple - is written in their
minimalist white text broken
down by each page into different
size fonts. The entire text is an
analysis of the artist's work, with
each page is its own entity.
As interesting as YHCHI is as
a corporate symbol, so too are its
artists as enigmatic individuals.
Neither Young-Hae Chang nor
Marc Voge followed the typical
contemporary artist trajectory,
and it is only in the last few years
that both poets have thought
of themselves as visual artists,
Oyobe explained.
"Because they began outside
of the typical visual arts pattern
and are now gaining such regard
for their work, YHCHI has a lot
of valuable experience and insight
that students need for the real
world of art today," Oyobe said.
Thursday's Penny Stamps talk,
"Young-Hae Chang Heavy Indus-
tries: One or Two Things We
Know About Art" will be a mas-
ter class in the real experience
and dedication it takes to create
original art in the modern world,
Oyobe explained. The lecture will
be at 5:10 p.m. at the Michigan
Theater, as part of the Penny W.
Stamps School of Art & Design's
lecture series.
"It's very special to hear them
speak," Oyobe said. "They do not
give that many lectures, though
they enjoy talking to students,
and we're very lucky to have them
so interested in wanting to come
speak to our students."
They are so careful about their
public image, Oyobe explained,
that in a recent interview, they
didn't even allow photographs. As
they climb to higher and higher
echelons in the art world, they
become even more careful.
"They have experience in the
art world, particularly in the
growing popularity of art fairs in
Europe and Asia, and they want
to share not only their perspec-
tive on the art world today, but
information on how to make it as
an artist," Oyobe said. "It's a very
important subject for students,
whether or not they are in the
arts."

Tio's tacos satisfy a
Mexican food skeptic

et's be blunt: I'm not a
fan of Mexican food. Is
it edible? Yes. Do I crave
it on the reg? Definitely not. But
from the moment I stepped onto
campus, peo-
ple couldn't
stop bragging
about Tio's
Mexican
Cafe (over on
East Liber-
ty). So after
all the hype, NATHAN
and per- WOOD
sonal prefer-
ences aside, I
decided to actually check it out
- twice, as a matter of fact. And
to tell the truth, it's not all bad.
Dinner No.1: Lotsa Tacos
Like most Mexican restau-
rants, Tio's has a sizable variety
of taco options. Since the tacos
are small and my appetite is not,
I choose five to try.
The Edamame Taco, my least
favorite, is sorely characterized
by displeasingly chewy Spanish
rice and predictably bland soy-
beans. In Tio's defense, though,
it can be a difficult feat to flavor
this insipid legume with any
complexity. The only other
notable quality is that this taco
is a disaster to eat, so steer clear
if on a first date.
Next, I try the Al Pastor,
which features shredded pork
loin and pineapple. The pork is
finely seasoned, but tough and
overcooked. And while the hot
pineapple provides an excep-
tional flavor and texture con-
trast, there simply is not enough
of it.
The Portobello Taco is a
respectable option in the veg-
etarian category, boasting well-
roasted mushroom caps whose
texture is humbly paired with a
spoonful of refried beans. The
flavors are understated and
mild.
The Fish Taco, a bold combi-
nation of deep-fried cod, jala-
peno ranch dressing and citrus
vinaigrette coleslaw, is a plea-
sure to eat. The cod is appropri-
ately dense andflaky, and the

and then I'd audition at their

felt inspiring again.
The first tour was the expe-
rience I'd always wanted. We
played clubs of all shapes and
sizes, with big shows in cities
like Chicago, L.A. and San Fran-
cisco. I was seeing the country,
connecting with friends and
family in places I'd always want-
ed to visit.
Only a few shows in, I had
become one of the guys. We had
deep talks on longrides, swapped
books, listened to great records.

would pick the best two items on
every menu and split them both,
landing us the inevitable collec-
tive nickname, "tour girlfriends"
COURTESY OFRAY MALO (even our actual girlfriends used
the term).

There were some lows -to
match the highs, mostly frustra-
tion from subpar showings or
breakdowns in transportation.
Our booking agent dropped the
ball on getting us gigs on the
way home, so our tour finished
15 hours from Brooklyn, at Sum-
merfest in Milwaukee. But what-
ever, it'd been almost six weeks.
And we were homesick.
On the long drive home, my
financial anxieties began to take
hold. I realized that, at best, I'd
broken even on this tour. I was
going to have to borrow money
from my mother to cover rent
and needed to find an employer
that either wouldn't mind if I
had to leave after a few months
or that I could fool into hiring
me short-term before the next
tour. April wasn't sure whether
another tour would even happen.
I began to think maybe my plan
wasn't so well thought out.
Back in New York, it took me
almost a month to find part-
time work. I scraped by for five
months before band manage-
ment put together another tour.
In that time, the band had done
some big things: gotten a few
songs licensed for television
shows and ads, made a high-
production-value music video,
played shows at Newport Folk
Festival and the U.S. Open Ten-
nis Championships. We were a
band on the rise. But a glimpse at
the tour schedule said otherwise:
We were playing essentially the
same small venues as the last
tour. And on the West Coast, an
alarming number of dates were
empty and thus void of income,
though we were assured that
they'd be filled in soon.
They weren't.. The financial
worries really started to set in.
The day I stumbled upon Dan's
e-mail was an unproductive day
off. I was intrigued by his concise
message, nine years after we'd
last spoken. The tour was end-
ing in Chicago and from there I
was intending to visit Ann Arbor
anyway. I wrote him back, asking

if he could meet me. He replied
right away, setting up a meeting
the day I got into Ann Arbor.
We met for three memo-
rable hours. Dan charted a path
toward finishing my degree and
we spoke at length about my var-
ied experiences. While he empa-
thized with my current situation,
he saw more clearly than I could
how much I had learned in my
years away. The risk was worth it
in the end.
The Return
Things moved quickly after
that. I quit the band on good
terms and, though I was sad to
end this chapter, I knew it was
the right thing for myself.
Needing a strong semester
elsewhere to repeal my sus-
pension, I enrolled at the New
School in New York in January
2011. Charged with a new con-
viction, I churned out four solid
As. An earnest, reflective peti-
tion later, I was readmitted to
the University.
In the last year and a half, I've
acquired a passion for classroom
learning that would have been 4
entirely foreign to my younger
self. I'm now able to do the things
most students at this University
do effortlessly, like turning in
assignments on time and par-
ticipating in class discussions.
And I have found inspiration in
the body of work I've created: A
final paper in a creative writing-
class proved practically euphor-
ic. Something clicked and words
just flowed.
I'll always play music and I'm
sincerely looking forward to my
next show, whenever it is.
I'm not your typical college
student, and I'm not naive: Part
of me wishes I could have done
the traditional four years. Yet
the detours I have taken on the I
way to a degree have provided
invaluable challenges I other-
wise wouldn't have faced and
rewards I would never have
received.

After his first year at the University did not work out, Ray worked in fashion retail.
