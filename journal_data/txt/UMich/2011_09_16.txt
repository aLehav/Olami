University President Mary
Sue Coleman received a 2.75-per-
cent pay raise at the University's
Board of Regents meeting yester-
day but promptly returned the
money.
Coleman said she receives

enough compensation from the
University and doesn't need
more than the $570,105 base
salary she cur-
rently receives. NOTEBOOK
Coleman grant-
ed the $15,678 pay increase to
enhance the scholarships she
and her husband, Ken, sponsor
for students wishing to study
abroad.
Last October, the regents
approved a 3-percent pay
increase for Coleman and last
November, the board extended
her contract for an additional

two years. Coleman's contract
i-aus through July2014.
According to an April article
in The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation, Coleman was ranked the
sixth-highest-paid university
president in the 2009-2010 fis-
cal year, the most recent year for
which data is available.
The regents' personnel, com-
pensation and governance com-
mittee conducted a performance
review before awarding this
year's salary raise. Regent S.
Martin Taylor (D-Grosse Pointe
Farms), the chair of the com-

mittee, read the regents' recom-
mendation for the raise saying
deserves the raise for her con-
tinuing efforts to better the Uni-
versity.
He said in an interview after
the meeting that he is not sur-
prised by Coleman's donation.
"Her willingness to give back
to the University has been there
since the beginning," Taylor said.
"She's been a terrific president,
and she loves this University
and she's shown it time and time
again."

Liberty St. Borders space

effects of closure
By MAAISA WINTER
Daily StaffReporter
Now that the doors of Bor-
ders on East Liberty Street
are officially closed, many
students, Ann Arbor residents

and local bookstore owners are
wondering what will next fill
the 37,000-square-foot space.
Ralph Welton, chief develop-
ment official for the city of Ann
Arbor, said the space has been
bought and will be subdivided
into three different build-outs.
"I think that either retail or
restaurants will soon occupy
the building because those are
always popular in Ann Arbor,"
Welton said.

Borders, Inc., which liqui-
dated 399 stores across the
country and closed the East
Liberty store on Monday, was
started in Ann Arbor by broth-
ers Tom and Louis Borders in
1971.

Union.
In the courtyard of the Michi-
gan Union yesterday, the Michi-
gan Student Assembly hosted its
first MFarmers' Market which
offered local produce and plants
for purchase, as well as live dem-
onstrations and instructions for
food preparation. MSA's new ini-
tiative, which many other Uni-
versity divisions also contributed
to, raise awareness about locally
grown food.

LSA senior Monica Sangal, the
MSA Health Issues Commission
chair, said she came up with the
idea for an on-campus farmer's
market because she wants fresh
produce to be available for stu-
dents.
"We really wanted to promote
healthy eating on campus," San-
gal said. "Normally, the Farmers
Market (in Kerrytown) is a little
too far away for getting food."

Nurses, doctors to

By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
The long-awaited C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital and Von
Voigtlarider Women's Hospi-
tal will open to the public on

Nov. 13, complete with tech-
nological advancements that
will increase communication
between patients and nurses.
In the hospital, clinicians
will operate and interact with
patients through a system
in which nurses and doctors
will use cell phones to trans-
mit alerts from patient rooms
to notify them when patient
needs assistance.
"Patients of a really high

acuity tend to have different
types of monitors attached to
them, and getting the alerts
and alarms out of those moni-
tors so that the caregivers
can understand them is really
important," said Christine

National plan calls
for Pentagon to cut
defense funding
ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY
AIRCRAFT (AP) - Defense Sec-
retary Leon Panetta warned Con-
gress yesterday that if lawmakers
fail to agree on debt-ceiling talks
and trigger $1 trillion in Pentagon
budget cuts, they could add 1 per-
centage point to the nation's job-
less rate.
Pentagon press secretary
George Little said yesterday that
Panetta has relayed those num-
bers to lawmakers in person and
in calls this week, urging Con-
gress to avoid the deadlock that
would require the sweeping cuts.
Under the current deficit-
reduction plan, the Pentagon
must slash more than $400 bil-
lion in defense spending over the
next decade. In addition, a newly
created deficit-cutting supercom-
mittee has until Nov. 23 to reach
a consensus on budget cuts. If
the committee members can't
agree, or if Congress rejects its
plan, automatic cuts of $1.2 tril-
lion would hit the government
accounts, with half coming from
defense spending.
The trillion dollar total, Little
said, would be devastating for the
military, forcing spending reduc-
tions thatlikely would necessitate
shrinking the size of the Army,
Air Force and Marine Corps to
the smallest numbers in decades
and also lead to the smallest Navy
in nearly 100 years.
"We would break faith with
those in uniform who are serv-

ing. At a time of war, that's unac-
ceptable," Little told reporters
traveling with Panetta back to
Washington after security meet-
ings with Australian leaders in
San Francisco.
Citing a new Pentagon analy-
sis, Little said the defense indus-
trial base provides 3.8 million
private sector jobs. He said the 1
percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate would include
government, military and private
sector jobs. He did not know how
many jobs that entails or how
many could be lost inthe individu-
algovernment and privatesectors.
The current national unem-
ployment rate is 9.1 percent.
The new comments reflect the
Pentagon's growing worries that
partisan divisions on Capitol Hill
could foil any attempt to reach
an accord on spending cuts and
revenue changes to meet the debt
reduction plan. Defense officials
have argued repeatedly that trig-
gering the automatic spending
reductions would mean slash-
ing military programs based on
arithmetic rather than on sound
national security strategy.
Panetta and his predecessor,
Robert Gates, have insisted that
government leaders and lawmak-
ers must decide what they want
their military to be able to do, and
then cut the budget accordingly,
rather than take a percentage off
all the accounts.
Defense spending has nearly
doubled since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terror attacks to more than $500
billion. That spending is separate
from the $1 trillion-plus for the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in
the past decade.

Re-affirm(ative action)
Circuit court shouldn't rehear appeal
Affirmative action is once again a topic of discussion within the
Michigan appellate court system. On July 1, a three-member
panel from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2 to
1 to remove the ban on consideration of race in college admissions
that Michigan voters approved in 2006. The decision, made in July, is
being reviewed again in 2012, but affirmative action should be used
by the University in its admissions process, and the courts should
reject this appeal.

In November 2006, Michigan voters passed
Proposition 2 - also known as the Michigan
Civil Rights Initiative - which was a proposed
amendment to the Michigan Constitution. The
proposal intended to bar public universities
from considering race in admissions decisions
as well as barring the consideration of race in
government hiring. Voters passed the amend-
ment by a vote of 58 to 42 percent. However, the
ban mustcultimately be overturned.
In a rare occurrence, the appeals court has
agreed to hear the case presented again in its
entirety. This time, the case will be heard by
the entire court rather than another three-
member panel. Oral arguments are set to
take place next year.
Prop 2, as it is currently written and
enforced by law, is unconstitutional. The
main purpose of the amendment violates the
14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution,
which grants all individuals equal protection
under the law. The proposition violates this
amendment because it fails to allow admis-
sions counselors to consider one's race as cri-
teria for admission. Admissions counselors
shouldn't be denied the option to consider
this component, which certainly plays a role
in an applicant's life.
As of now, Prop 2 remains in effect, mean-

ing the University is unable to consider race
for its current undergraduate application
cycle. The University needs tobe able to con-
sider this and give these students a chance
to attend an established college in order to
reach their full potential.
The consideration of race in college admis-
sions not only promotes a sense of cultural
understanding throughout the University,
but it also promotes diversity. In order for the
University to be a truly diverse community,
it must factor in components like race and
socioeconomic status when making admis-
sions decisions. Not allowing the University
to consider race is unacceptable.
Opponents of affirmative action often
claim the policy is reverse discrimination.
However, affirmative action simply seeks to
give universities the opportunity to evaluate
applicants holistically by considering their
entire background in its entirety.
Right now, admissions counselors here at
the University are beginning to sift through
piles of applications. The University prides
itself on the promotion of tolerance and
acceptance of all people. Failing to consider
race in the admissions process prohibits the
University from upholding its commitment
to diversity.

AIDA ALI 1'.
Honor all lives lost on 9 11

On Sept. 11 2001, I was at home about
6,000 miles away from New York City, fin-
ishing up my fifth-grade homework when
my mom received a phone call, screamed and
ran to the television to watch the news. As I
joined her in watching the iconic towers of
New York City crumble to the ground, I was
horrified, but not horrified enough. For what
I presumed to be just another disturbing
piece of news of the world outside my own
was really an event that was going to send
waves of destruction, misunderstanding and
fear all over the world. It was goingto change
the lives of billions of people forever, includ-
ing me.
I have lived all my life in Kuwait, and the
geographic location of the country - bor-
dered by Saudi Arabia and Iraq - was never
as significant as it became after Sept. 11.
There have been several times over the past
years when it's been interesting to watch the
play of emotions on people's faces when I tell
them where I'm from and the religion I was
born into. Some people are fascinated while
others are judgmental - the former being a
little naive and the latter being completely
shallow and annoying.
A couple years ago, I flew to John F. Ken-
nedy International Airport in New York from
Kuwait and was detained by security for an
hour. The officer told me security officials
were looking for "someone with my name"
and escorted me to a small, scary room where
I sat terrified for 60 minutes before they
handed back my passport and told me I was
free to go. Yes, I have noticed an obvious bias
in the Western world against me, and I don't
know who to blame.
But the things I have had to deal with are
petty and negligible compared to what mil-
lions of others have had to go through. These
#4

are the people who have lived in the middle
of war for the past 10 years. They have lost
their homes, their families, their nation and
even their lives for something many of them
don't even fully understand. The tragedy
of Sept. 11 resulted in a death toll of almost
3,000 Americans, and the wars that have fol-
lowed 9/11 in the last 10 years have taken the
lives of more than a million people.
This Sept. 11, the media flooded the world
with memories of 9/11 and made many relive
the experience. As Americans' grief resur-
faced, it brought with it once again the feel-
ings of anger and revenge. But this time a
new and strong voice of regret and doubt
emerged as well - were we right to wage war
as we did? Is all we have done in the past 10
years completely justified?
I'm afraid these questions do not have one
clear answer. Trying to imagine the current
situation any other way is impossible now.
We cannot undo what has happened, nor
can we make everything OK just like that.
But perhaps we could acknowledge 9/11 as a
tragedy involving the death of almost 3,000
American victims and millions who died in
the events that followed, including soldiers
from more than 20 other countries.
News this past week has focused on little
other than the thousands who died in the
United States. We should widen the focus and
make 9/11 a day when the world mourns the
consequences of human action and holds acan-
dlelight vigil for the loss of millions of human
lives. It shouldbe a day when not only America,
but the entire world unites to fight insecurities
and misunderstandings, so in another 10 years
this will be history that has altered our lives
but doesn't punish us anymore.

anticipating an uptick in busi-
ness, others said they're unsure
what kind of impact the closure
will have on their stores.
Nicola Rooney, owner of Nico-
la's Books on Jackson Avenue in
Ann Arbor, said she anticipates a
definite change in the customer
traffic of local bookstores due
to Borders's closing. She added
that she has noticed an upswing
in patronage at her store since
August.
"People who used to buy
books in Borders are looking to
us to carry what they are looking
for," Rooney said. "Groups who
used to meet in Borders now
" meet here. We are adjusting our
inventory to cater to the people."
Rooney said she antici-
pates that the dynamics of Ann
Arbor's downtown businesses
will continue to adapt despite

From Page 1
Sangal teamed up with Keith
Soster, the food service direc-
tor at the Michigan Union, to
brainstorm the idea for the mar-
ket. A variety of campus divi-
sions collaborated on the project,
including representatives from
MHealthy, University Housing,
the Student Sustainability Ini-
tiative, Planet Blue, University
Catering, University Arts and
Programs, University Health
Services and the Graham Envi-
ronmental Sustainability Insti-
tute.
Soster said he hopes the farm-
ers market will educate the Uni-
versity community about what
the broader Ann Arbor commu-
nity has to offer.
"That is ultimately our goal -
to educate the community as to
what is available out there," Sos-
ter said. "This is a great time of
the year because harvest time is
approaching, so we'll have lots of
great varieties."
MSA also approached the Uni-
versity Unions with the project
because the assembly had heard

ever, since patients will be in

receive alerts in the form of cell
phone messages.
To ensure a smooth transition
to the new system, several units
of the hospital staff have already
been practicing with the phones,
Szumko said.

the loss of Borders.
"Now people have to make
the decision to come out to other
bookstores that are now in the
downtown area," Rooney said.
"We will be watching to see what
people are looking for and make
sure to keep the right options in
stock. I don't assume any spe-
cific change, but I am watching
and will respond quickly. There
definitely will be a change."
Corby Gillmore, manager of
the Dawn Treader Book Shop
on East Liberty Street, said
he isn't sure what will replace
the void Borders left in town
but expressed regret about the
store's closing.
"In a couple of months from
now we will have a better idea
of what is going on with the
replacement, but (what) I do
know is that more people are not
coming downtown to pass the
time at Borders anymore, and
that is bad for all of us," Gillmore
said.

While Borders was competi-
tion for local bookstores, the
attention and number of stu-
dents it brought to the State
Street area made it a beneficial
asset, Gillmore said.
"Hopefully a couple of retail
stores will replace the book-
store, but it has been there for
so long, it's hard to know what's
coming next," he said. "All we
can do is adapt to the change."
Rachel Pastiva, owner of
Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & Tea
Room on Main Street, said she
is also unsure about what will
fill the space but added that she
hopes to increase her success as
a bookstore due to the closing.
"I don't think we've been
planning any specific way of
changing our store, but we hope
to have a more mainstream title
as a specialty bookstore," Pasti-
va said. "It's a question we are all
asking ourselves of how this will
affect bookstores and what peo-
ple are looking for in general."

COLEMAN
From Page 1
Coleman, who has been at
the University since 2002, has
been in line for a merit-based pay
raise every year. But in 2009, she
requested that the regents not
give her a raise. In 2007, she also
donated her 3 percent pay raise
back to the University.
CRISLER ARENA CLEARED
FOR NEXT STAGE OF
RENOVATION PROCESS
The ongoing renovations to
Crisler Arena received another
thumbs-up from the regents yes-
terday when they approved the
project to continue by accepting
outside bids and offering con-
struction contracts.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer, said
the renovations aren't sched-
uled to finish until winter 2014
because the arena will still be
used during the basketball sea-
sons, he said.
"It's tricky in and out of sea-
sons," Slottow said.
The regents' approval stipu-
lates that the submission of bids
are within the proposed $52 mil-
lion budget for the project. In
May, the regents approved the
schematic design for the renova-
tions.
At yesterday's meeting, Slot-
tow reported that the next phase
of the construction will involve
the addition of new fan entranc-
es and amenities. He added that
renovating is more cost-efficient

for the University than buildinga
new arena.
G.G. BROWN TO RECEIVE
FUNDING FOR UPDATE
The regents voted during
their meeting yesterday to reno-
vate the George Granger Brown
Memorial Laboratories on North
Campus.
The state will fund approxi-
mately $30 million of the project,
while the University will cover
the approximately $17 million
in remaining expenses. Slottow
said in an interview after the
meeting that he is grateful to the
state of Michigan for contrib-
uting so generously to the G.G.
Brown project.
"It's the first time the state
has come through ina number of
years," said Slottow, adding that
the contribution is a change from
the steady decline that has char-
acterized state funding in recent
years.
Science buildings are espe-
cially important to maintain, and
G.G. Brown has been in need of
a renovation for about a decade,
Slottow said.
"It'sjust crucially important to
keep taking care of the really old
buildings that provide so much
support for University research,"
he said.
REGENTS APPROVE
716 OAKLAND PURCHASE
The regents also approved
the purchase of property locat-
ed between the University Law
School's Weill Hall and South
Hall.

The purchase was made amid
widespread construction cur-
rently taking place at the Law
School. The school's upcoming
building, South Hall, is still being
built and is scheduled to be com-
pleted in January 2012. The Uni-
versity is also negotiating with
the city to constructa pedestrian
mall on the 700 block of Monroe
Street to connect South Hall with
the rest of the Law Quadrangle.
Regent Andrew Richner (R-
Grosse Pointe Park) approved the
purchase and said he could speak
to the qualityofthe Oakland Ave-
nue lot since he lived in a house
there during his time as a Law
School student.
"It's great the University is
acquiring the property and it's a
betteruse as well."
FINANCIAL AID AWARDS
AT ALL-TIME HIGH
Donations to the University
increased in almost every donor
categorythis year.
Jerry May, the University's
vice president for development,
delivered an annual development
report to the regents yesterday.
Contributions to the University
by foundations increased by 26
percent, and corporations donat-
ed 10 percent more than they did
last year. May said there has also
been a 7-percent increase in gifts
and pledge payments.
Still, May said the figure he is
most proud of is that 11,200 stu-
dents received financial aid this
year - the most students to have
ever received financial support.
"It's an all-time record and it's
really-exciting," May said.


ested in having more local and
fresh items available on campus,
said Laura Seagram, marketing
communications specialist for
the University Unions.
The University already stocks
locally grown products in Uni-
versity dining halls and retail
locations such as Beanster's Cafe,
University Club Cafe and U-go's.
However, Seagram said she
believes the farmers market will
be an opportunity for students
to get to know more about local
produce.
"This is a handy way to have
the farmers get a little bit more
exposure and have direct contact
withthe students," Seagramsaid.
At yesterday's market, two
chefs from Residential Dining
Services and the Michigan Union
led a cooking demonstration
focused on healthy eating and
preparing easy, affordable meals
that students can make at home.
Tina Todosciuk - a firmer
from Howell, Mich. had a table
at the market and sold sweet
corn, melon, eggplant, tomatoes
and peppers. Todosciuk said she
hopes the market encourages
students to get more interested in
locally grown food.
"The great thing about local

food is that you know where it's
coming from, you know how
it's raised," she said. "You know
what chemicals are in it, or not in
it, and it's more nutritional."
Sangal wrote in an e-mail
interview that the MFarmers
Market - scheduled next for Oct.
6 - offered a variety of produce
including apples, squash, plums,
tomatoes, sweet corn, eggplant,
peppers, melons and watermel-
on.
Law School student Mary Fee
said she appreciated the markets
selection, especially considering
it was the first run.
"It's great," she said. "It's
small, but it seems to have as
much variety as a farmer's mar-
ket usually does."
LSA junior Stacy Kim said she
decided to check out the market
after receiving an"invite to its
debut on Facebook. Kim praised
the market, calling it "cute" and
"adorable."
But the market could benefit
from a change of location, Kim
said.
"It was kind of hard to under-
stand where (the Union patio)
was," she said. "Maybe if they
could have it in a more recogniz-
able location, it would be nice."



NURSES
From Page 1
in support of MNA - including
about 20 undergraduate stu-
dents - were among the crowd.
For the duration of the two-hour
meeting that was standing-room
only, supporters also held up sev-
eral large banners that displayed
thousands of signatures from
University nurses.
Public Policy junior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, co-chair of the
Social Justice Committee of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, said he attended the
meeting because he is worried
about the future ofcollective bar-
gaining rights.
"If we support (the nurses)
now, then going into the work-
place when we graduate, it'll be
more accommodating to what
we want tosee in the workplace,"
Mersol-Barg said. "We might
have more of a say when we go
out then, instead of leaving it on
the trajectory it's going on cur-
rently, where we might not have
any negotiating rights when we
graduate."
Other students behind MNA

are members of the Michigan
Student Assembly, which passed
a resolution at its meeting on
Tuesday to support the nurses in
the negotiations. For about the
last two weeks, representatives
of the union have provided infor-
mation to MSA about the nego-
tiations.
In his regular monthly address
before the board, MSA Presi-
dent DeAndree Watson said the
assembly was wary of potential
impacts the negotiations could
have on the campus community.
"After considering the
information provided and the,
concerns of some of the rep-
resentatives around the table,
including the Nursing student
representative, the assembly
decided to express its support of
the Nurses Council in an effort
to protect students from any
potential negative effects of the
contract negotiations," Watson
said.
Representatives from local
unions such as the Lecturers'
Employee Organization and the
Graduate Employees' Organiza-
tion also attended the meeting.
Britt Satchwell, president of the
Ann Arbor Education Associa-

tion, spoke before the regents on
behalf of the nurses. Despite the
tough economic times, Satch-
well said the University should
be understanding of the nurses'
predicament.
"Just as we try to keep the cuts
as far away from the classroom in
education, so should you keep the
cuts as far away from the hospital
corridors and bedsides," Satch-
well said in aprepared statement.
When asked about the nego-
tiations, several regents declined
to comment, but Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
said she appreciated that the
union came to speak to the board.
"I think this is appropriate,
but I think it's only one part of
the discussion," Newman said,
acknowledging that talks are
ongoing behind closed doors.
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) said she was "very
interested" in continuing to dis-
cuss the situation amongst the
regents.
"(They) showed a lot of com-
mitment and care, which is
always what you want to see from
our nurses, and I only have come
to expect their professionalism,"
Ilitch said.

said. "So today, they're just using
the features of the phone - how
to call each other, having to get
used to wearing it, how to under-
stand who has what phone."
The most significant part of
the new system, Szumko added,
is the technology involved in
transmitting the alerts from the
monitors to the phones, since the
messages must cross a variety of
electronic barriers. The system
was created by Connexall USA
- a company that creates orga-
nizational methods for medical
information and communication.
"What we're really excited
about is that we have middle-
ware, this software that sits in
the middle of everything and

is able to take various different
inputs - whether it's from the
nurse call system or the patient
monitors system - and send it to
various different outputs, like the
wireless phones or the pagers,"
she said.
Ultimately, improving the
quality of care for patients also
improves the quality of care
provided by doctors and nurses,
Szumko said.
"The environment itself pro-
vides a better care environment
for the patients, and this is what
we're going to give to our care-
givers," she said. "To sort of
extend their eyes and ears into
the patient rooms when they're
not physically present."

TARA TODRAS-WHITEHILL/AP
Palestinians hold candles during a demonstration in support oftheir bid for statehood, outside the Church ofnthe Nativity, in
the West Bank town of Bethlehem, yesterday.
Palestinians continue to
pursue United Nations bid

Against wishes
of United States,
Palestinians seek
U.N. recognition
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)
- In a direct challenge to the
United States, the Palestinians
said yesterday they will ask the
Security Council next week to
accept them as a full member of
the United Nations, even though
Washington has promised to
veto the measure.
The Palestinian assertion
came as a senior U.S. diplomatic
team was in the region trying
to avert an embarrassing show-
down and relaunch peace talks.
By pushing forward, the Pales-
tinians risk putting President
Barack Obama in the uneasy
position of having to veto a
measure supported by the vast
majority of the international
community.
Foreign Minister Riad Malki
told foreign journalists the Pal-
estinians were not looking for a
fight. But he said the American
stance puts the U.S. ina "confron-
tational position" with the rest of
the world, and suggested Ameri-
can credibility could be at stake.
"I don't know what it means
to the standing of the U.S. in the
United Nations and among the
countries of the world," he said.
Even so, the Palestinians left

the door open for compromise.
Malki said the Palestinians
were still ready to listen to sug-
gestions from American envoys.
And in New York, his U.N.
ambassador, Riyad Mansour,
said a final decision on whether
to pursue recognition in the
Security Council, or seek a less-
er, symbolic status in the General
Assembly had not yet been made.
"The final decision will be
taken in the next few days as to
which path we will follow," Man-
sour said.
Asked about his boss's com-
ments in Ramallah, he replied:
"There are many words from
many places, but what I'm telling
you is that we are deliberating
all these details and it is not yet
finalized." Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas was to give a
speech Friday in Ramallah and
there was speculation he might
address the issue then.
In Washington, White House
spokesman Jay Carney empha-
sized that negotiation with Israel
was the only viable path to Pales-
tinian statehood.
"The Palestinians will not
and cannot achieve statehood
through a declaration at the
United Nations. It is a distrac-
tion, and in fact, it's counter-
productive," he said, adding
that "the only way to resolve the
issues between the Palestinians
and the Israelis, and to ultimate-
ly create a Palestinian state, is
through direct negotiations."

The Palestinians seek an inde-
pendent state in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, with east Jeru-
salem as their capital. Israel cap-
tured the territories in the 1967
Mideast war.
Israeli Prime Minister Ben-
jamin Netanyahu rejects a com-
plete pullout from the West Bank
and says Israel must retain east
Jerusalem, which it considers
an inseparable part of its capi-
tal. Israel withdrew from Gaza
in 2005.
The Palestinians say they are
turning to the U.N. in frustra-
tion after years of failed peace
talks. While a U.N. vote will
not change the situation on the
ground, the Palestinians believe
it will improve their position in
future talks. In particular, they
say Israel must accept the 1967
borders as the basis of a future
agreement.
By doing so, Malki argued
Israel could help end its growing
international isolation. Israel's
relations with key regional allies
Egypt, Turkey and Jordan have
all grown rocky in recent months.
"I think the best way out for
Israel today is to come forward
and to recognize the state of Pal-
estine on the '67 borders," Malki
said.
Obama himself has endorsed
the 1967 lines as the basis for a
settlement. But he, like Israel,
says a peace agreement can be
reached only through negotia-
tions.

caused the two sides to miss

"I know we are the smallest

said in the letter, which was
obtained by The Associated
Press.
King would not comment on
the letter when reached by tele-
phone early yesterday.
King spent much of the day
Wednesday negotiating with
GM, but it was unclear why
he didn't appear at Chrysler's
Auburn Hills, Mich., headquar-
ters.
Marchionne said a few main-
ly economic issues separate the
two sides. He said he would
agree to a weeklong extension
of Chrysler's current contract.
"We did not accomplish what
leaders who have been tasked
with the turning of a new page
for this industry should have
done," he wrote.
Chaison said Marchionne
made the mistake of injecting
personalities into the talks at
a critical late stage. That could
delay a contract agreement.
Marchionne, he said, clearly is
miffed that GM is getting more
attention from the union than
Chrysler.
"He also has to understand
that these are not typical nego-
tiations," Chaison said, noting
that the talks are being watched
by the White House, the public
and the labor movement. The
U.S. government still owns 26.5
percent of GM, the remainder of
a big stake it got in exchange for
bailing out the company.
It's likely, though, that any
setback in the negotiations at
Chrysler is temporary. The
UAW has an interest in reaching
a deal because a union-run trust
that pays retiree health care
bills owns more than 40 percent
of Chrysler. Chrysler has turned
a small profit in the fist half of
the year, excluding a one-time
accounting charge for refinanc-
ing government bailout debts.

44-year-old
mother becomes
first woman to lead
Denmark
COPENHAGEN, Denmark
(AP) - When Helle Thorning-
Schmidt took control of the
Social Democratic Party in
2005, some called her "Gucci
Helle," mocking her taste for
designer clothes and accesso-
ries.
Today, few people question
her credentials as leader of a
party sprung from Denmark's
labor movement in 1871.
The 44-year-old mother of
two, who is married to former
British Labor Leader Neal Kin-
nock's son, has shed an air of
inexperience and now projects
confidence and poise. She's fine-
tuned her debating skills and
handles media with wit and a
disarming smile.
But it took a painful defeat to
get there.
In her first election as party
leader in 2007, a teary-eyed
Thorning-Schmidt watched the
Social Democrats slump to their
worst result in a century, with
25.5 percent of the votes.
"Danes need more time
before they hand over responsi-
bility to us," she said.
They needed four more years,
fraught by economic turmoil.
Ironically, the Social Demo-
crats dropped another parlia-
mentary seat in the election
yesterday, but a strong showing
by other parties in her center-

left alliance secured a majority.
"The Social Democrats are
ready to take their share of the
responsibility," the tall blonde
told her supporters. "We will do
our utmost, our utmost to live up
to your confidence."
It remains to be seen whether
Thorning-Schmidt will be a bet-
ter steward of Denmark's lack-
luster economy than outgoing
Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen at a time when
Europe's debt crisis creates
uncertainty.
Thorning-Schmidt will
become the first woman to lead
a Danish government, and she's
also the first female leader of the
Social Democrats. However, she
doesn't think those firsts will
have much significance in egali-
tarian Denmark.
"Exceptmaybe foryounggirls
who can start saying'hmm, this
is a post I can aspire to,"' Thorn-
ing-Schmidt said in a recent TV
interview.
Looking back at her youth,
she said she always wanted to
be a decision-maker "like a hotel
manager or something like that"
but never imagined making it to
the top of Danish politics.
Thorning-Schmidt got a mas-
ter's degree in political science
from Copenhagen University in
1994. Two years later, she mar-
ried Stephen Kinnock, whom
she met in Belgium.
She lives with their two
daughters, Johanna, 14, and
Camilla, 11, in a rowhouse in
northern Copenhagen, while
Kinnock is based in Switzerland
as a director of the World Eco-
nomic Forum.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOKa
Love for a local library

By JENNIFER XU
Senior Arts Editor
Recently, our local library was
rocked with a scandal that shook
America to its very core, as they
say in melodramatic news pro-
grams. It almost closed down.
It's funny, but when I think
about the times I spent there,
I don't think about the hours I
exhausted browsing its dusty
shelves for "Sweet Valley High"
books (I was obsessed with the
Wakefield twins back then), or
the hundreds of study sessions
spent in the children's section
cramming for the APs or even
the illicit romances that went
down tucked behind closed
doors (admittedly, some of them
fictional).
I think about how I got into a
car accident there (my first hit-
and-run, if you want to know
the truth), how I turned into
a parking spot, overshot it and
basically grinded into the car
standing adjacent to me, leaving
the incriminating stain of red on
white, like the few drops of blood
that trickled down when Sleep-
ing Beauty pricked her finger on
the spinning wheel and fell into a
deep, deep slumber. I remember
running into the library in pur-
suit of the friend I was supposed
to pick up for ice cream, finding
her in the midst of being asked
to prom via an elaborate staging
of multicolored origami frogs,
dragging both asker and askee
into my illicit vehicle and high-
tailing it the hell out of there. I
didn't drive back to the library on
my own for a long, long time.
I've always associated the
building, its ugly worn brown-
stone with the faded letters
TROY stamped on its exterior,
with freedom. The library was
the first place I drove to when I
got my license at the ripe old age
of 17. I didn't even walk inside
the building when I got there,

COURTESY OF FOXSEARCHLIGHTS
"All these bands? You've never heard of them. All those books? Those, too."
So over DesChanel

Don't be pulled in
by the adorable face
of Zooey Deschanel
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Magazine Editor
Of all the terrible shows that
will premiere this fall, it was
"New Girl" that made me audi-
bly groan. The FOX sitcom stars
Zooey Deschanel ("(500) Days
of Summer") as a quirky, eccen-
tric 20-something getting over
a rough breakup with the help
of her new bro pals. It's not that
the show sounds bad. In fact, I
read the script and think it will
likely be one of the more suc-
cessful new series this fall. I
just can't stand Zooey Descha-
nel.
I'm aware that's an unpopu-
lar opinion. But the thing is,
Zooey represents everything I
feel is wrong with Hollywood,
and seeing her porcelain face
on the cover of this week's New
York Magazine has sent me over
the edge.
Deschanel soared to indie
darling heights in weak female
roles: bitchy roommates, crazy
ex-girlfriends and doe-eyed
sweethearts for the lead man
to win over. Then she became
a household name as Summer
Finn in "(500) Days of Summer."
Summer and Zooey are largely
indistinguishable. They both
wear cute, feminine dresses
and love bands you've probably
never heard of. But Summer, as
a character, only exists to make
Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)
grow and accept life.
This isn't inherently prob-
lematic. After all, Tom is the
protagonist; every character
only exists to make him grow.

The problem comes in when
every sensitive guy in glasses
wants to be with a girl just
like Zooey/Summer and every
girl who was ever described as
"quirky," even once, wants to
be her. It's then that the brood-
ing boys in skinny jeans expect
the cute woman reading Oscar
Wilde in the local coffee shop
to "fix" them, and the wannabe
dream girls who wear vintage
feel they have to keep their
quirkiness at a constant high,
while also being spontaneous
and unpredictable.
What's more, many feminists
have argued that Zooey's love
of sugar and spice and every-
thing nice fetishizes girlish-
ness and leads to infantilization
of women in media, making it
harder for real women to be
taken seriously. For men, Zoo-
ey's female ideal is perfection.
But I am not perfect. My mere
existence isn't going to give any
man an epiphany, and I actu-
ally hate cupcakes, thank you
very much. Many of my bad first
dates could've been rectified
had my dates known this.
Beyond glorifying and
romanticizing a weak female
mentality, Zooey epitomizes
the star system, the method of

name becomes the most impor-
tant facet of a production. I'm
sure she's not stomping around
sets ordering drastic creative
changes just because she can,
but she does have a noticeable
effect on people - particularly
critics.

ics Association's summer press
tour, a two-week conference
during which all the major TV
and cable networks present
their shows and host Q & A ses-
sions with the critics, Zooey

owned her audience. Critics
are notoriously not very nice,
and they don't clap much. But
they were filled with nothing
but adoration during the "New
Girl" panel. All professional-
ism died as many of the mean-
est critics in Hollywood raved
about how sweet Zooey is.
One critic even dared to
ask the hard-hitting question,
"When did you realize how
adorable you were?" It was
talked about for days. I wanted 0,
to vomit.
"New Girl" is a great script,
but I fear no one will notice the
writing hidden behind those
large fringe bangs and big blue
eyes. No one sees story - they
just see Zooey.
She's not exactly untouch-
able. Take one look at her IMDb
page and you'll see she's not
God's gift to acting, as the world
treats her. I'll give her "(500)
Days of Summer" and "Our
Idiot Brother," but then we're
left with "Yes Man," "Surf's
Up," "The Happening" and
"Your Highness" - hardly Sun-
dance fodder.
She's not without petty
squabbles. She got in a heated
fight with Los Angeles Times
columnist Patt Morrison after
he reported on Zooey's wor-
ries about how the royal couple
would view downtown Los
Angeles. She's also suing Steve
Madden for $2 million over an
endorsement deal. But these
qualms go largely unnoticed,
because she's Zooey Deschanel
and she can do no wrong.
While everyone goes gaga
for "New Girl," I'll be watching
alone, waiting for society to get
over their giant collective crush
on Zooey Deschanel and accept
reality: Girls like that don't
exist. And that's OK.
our more "civilized" European
cousins engage in such behav-
iors as booing and whistling
when they are displeased. In
2006, superstar tenor Roberto
Alagna was booed at La Scala
following his opening aria
in "Aida." Enraged, the divo
stormed off the stage and had to
be replaced by an un-costumed
understudy.
Did Alagna deserve it? Proba-
bly not, but the situation proves
refusingto clap maynotbe quite
the faux pas that it appears.
With a new theater season
here, it's time American audi-
ences start to recognize their
rights as patrons, including the
right to get one's money's worth.
If the performers don't come
through with their end of the
deal, then it's not your place to
pretend like they did.When itall
boils down, the decision to clap
means staying honest to oneself:
Are you clapping because you
actually enjoyed it, or are you
clapping because everyone else
is? Remember that the next time
you make a move to "put your
hands together."


CLAPPING
From Page 7
the singer's voice cracked and
he was flat the entire evening,
then sit on your hands during
the curtain call.
Audiences, however, have
it in their heads that it's polite
to clap - that they're supposed
to give a big hand, no matter
how poor the performance. But
professional theater isn't some
fourth-grade pageant during
which you applaud to make the
kids feel good. These perform-
ers are being paid to do their
jobs correctly, and it's your
money they're getting. Ifa doc-
tor gives the wfong diagnosis,
you sure as hell won't give him a
pat on the back. So why give an
underserved ovation to a less-
than-satisfactory performance?
The same goes for the now-
meaningless standing ova-
tion. What should be reserved
for only the most illuminating
and virtuosic performances is
wasted over and over again on
the likes of community theater.

Take, for instance, the time a
friend and I went to see a high
school performance of "Les
Miserables." After the final cur-
tain, while the rest of the audi-
ence rose to their feet, my friend
and I remained seated. A scan-
dalized audience member in the
row behind us made sure we
heard her when she remarked
to her companion, "Some people
are so rude!" That she found it
such an offense in the first place
reveals how deeply rooted this
philosophy is in our society.
We must keep in mind that
the act of bowing is one of
humility - the performer hum-
bly comes forward to receive
the audience's appreciation
through a bow, as if to say, "I
don't deserve this." The irony is,
many performers don't deserve
it, making the whole process a
sham.
I'm sure there will be those
who deem me a boorish, toma-
to-flinging philistine. These
critics may be surprised to learn
that in Europe - especially in
Italy - honesty reigns supreme
during curtain calls. In fact,

Breakdown: EMU run game worrisome for 'M'

ByKEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
Eastern Michigan is 2-0 for
the first time since 1989. For-
mer Michigan football players
Kurt Anderson, Mike Hart and
Steve Morrison are now part of
the Eagles' coaching squad, and
long-time Michigan assistant
coach Ron English is now the
Eagles' head coach. Will the for-
mer Wolverines be able to work
up some old magic to help give
the Eagles their first-ever vic-
tory against Michigan? There's a
chance, but not a very good one.
Here's a breakdown of Saturday's
matchups:
Michigan pass offense vs. East-
ern Michigan pass deferse
In victories against Howard
University and Alabama State,
the Eagles gave up an average 171
yards per game in the air. They're
not horrible numbers, but when
you consider the opponents East-
ern Michigan faced (both are
FCS schools), the numbers aren't
exactly eye-popping. Sophomore
defensive back Marlon Pollard, a
transfer from UCLA, has been a
nice addition for the Eagles and
has already snagged one inter-
ception. Senior defensive back
Latarrius Thomas, a transfer
who started as a true freshman at
Louisville, has also improved the
defense,
The Michigan offense has seen
some troubles of its own through
the air, as junior quarterback
Denard Robinson has completed
just over 50 percent of his passes
and has thrown'three intercep-
tions, often having trouble with
his footwork and accuracy. At

times, the receivers have shown
an inability to hang onto balls that
they should have caught. But you
can bet that the Eagles have never
faced a versatile quarterback quite
like Robinson (except for Rob-
inson himself in 2009), and he
should be successful as long as he
stays poised.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs. East-
ern Michigan rush defense
For the most part, the Michi-
gan running backs have strug-
gled so far this season. Redshirt
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint
appeared to have taken hold of the
starting job after his 80 yards and
two touchdowns against Western
Michigan, but a shoulder injury
kept him sidelined against Notre
Dame last weekend and his role on
Saturday is up in the air.
Senior Michael Shaw stalled in
the starting role last week, tallying
two carries for minus-three yards.
Sophomore Stephen Hopkins
didn't fare much better, with just
10 yards on five carries and one
fumble. Junior Vincent Smith has
shown flashes of potential, but it
appears he will be primarily used
as a third-down back.
The Eastern Michigan defense
excels against the rush. The
Eagles have given up an average
of just 41.5 yards per game on the
ground, including minus-13 yards
in their 14-7 victory over Ala-
bama State. Pollard and Thomas
received preseason All-MAC rec-
ognition, and senior defensive end
Brad Ohrman leads the MAC with
three sacks already this year. But
Michigan still has the most dan-
gerous rusher on the field in Rob-
inson, who is averaging 77 yards

per game and can break loose at
any point. That's enough to give
the Wolverines a slight edge.
Edge: Michigan
Eastern Michigan pass offense
vs. Michigan pass defense
The Eastern Michigan passing
game has been far from stellar
this year, but then again, so has
the Michigan pass defense. Eagles
quarterback Alex Gillett has com-
pleted just 47 percent of his passes
for 176 total yards, three touch-
downs and two interceptions.
His longest completion went
for just 25 yards. The Wolverine
defense has given up an average
of 249 yards per game in the air -
over a third more yards than Gil-
lett has passed for in two games.
But Michigan has forced three
interceptions so far, and Gillett is
a prime subject to toss up a few
more.
Edge: Michigan
Eastern Michigan rush offense
vs. Michigan rush defense
The Eagle running backs have
proven to be a two-headed mon-
ster so far this season. Asa whole,
Eastern Michigan is averaging 331
yards on the ground in two games.
Redshirt junior Dominique Sherer
and sophomore Javonti Green
crossed the century mark in each
of the Eagles' first two games.
Green is averaging 133 yards per
game, and Sherrer is averaging
115.
That could spell trouble for the
Wolverines, who are tenth in the
Big Ten in rush defense and have
given up an average of 147 yards
on the ground per game. Redshirt
junior safety Jordan Kovacs is tied

VOLLEYBALL
Rosen plans to open up offense for Dannemiller

Freshman setter
finding her groove
entering last
preseason tourney
By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Mark Rosen may not be work-
ing at Baskin Robbins, but he is
hard at work adding new flavors
to his offense for freshman set-
ter Lexi Dannemiller.
"We are still running a very
vanilla offense," said Rosen, the
Michigan volleyball coach. "It's
starting to get a little chocolate
swirl, but we need to get to the
point where it's got whipped
cream and a cherry and the
whole bit. We are a long way
from that, but we're getting
there.
"We are confident that we
can probably be successful
this weekend with the stuff
we're running, but we are
going to need to have more
tricks in our bag to compete
in two weeks at the Big Ten
level."
While Rosen's metaphors
may be strange and may bring
about a hankering for some-
thing sweet, his logic holds
~true.
Dannemiller's ability to
spread the offense has been
a cornerstone to Michigan's
success this year. Rosen sim-
ply knows that Dannemiller is
going to have to become more
creative with her sets to com-
pete in the upcoming weeks.
His veteran women's volley-
ball team has proven that it is
capable of executing complex
offenses under three-time All
American Lexi Zimmerman.
Big Ten Athlete of the Week
Dannemiller will have to step
up the flavor of this Wolver-
ine sundae. But for now, as
Rosen often says, "It's a work
in progress."
Coming off their Dayton
Flyers Classic victory, the
18th-ranked Wolverines are
preparing for the Michigan/
Adidas Invitational in Ann
Arbor this weekend. Michigan
will face Toledo and Xavier
on Friday, and Texas A&M on
Saturday.
Each team will bring its
own unique challenges. Xavi-

er plays a fast game that may
prove difficult to contain. Texas
A&M is the only other team in
the tournament with an unde-
feated record.
And Toledo has shown an
aptitude for kills despite its los-
ing record, which indicates that
the Rockets are capable of going
on major runs.
Toledo was also one of the
few teams to beat Michigan last
year.
As the last tournament of the
preseason, the Wolverines will
look to make the final adjust-
ments to Dannemiller's game,
specifically how she weaves
middle blockers sophomore Jen-
nifer Cross and senior Courtney
Fletcher into the offense.
The job of the middle blocker
is multi-faceted and is integral
to both the offensive and defen-
sive sides of the net.
The main responsibility,

though, is in the name - block-
ing, a skill Michigan has been
looking to improve since the
start of the season.
"Jen and I take a lot of pride
in our blocking," Fletcher said.
"It's definitely not our best skill,
it never has been. But before
every match we look at each
other and say, 'We are going to
go block some balls.' We also
just adopted swing blocking,
and while it was a little rough
in the beginning of the season,
I thought last weekend was the
best it's been so far, and it will
continue to get better."
Added Cross: "No one wants
to be a middle blocker. We're
constantly going from pin to
pin. It's a hard job, but some-
body's got to do it."
Cross and Fletcher also share
the same favorite kill spot - a
complex set they call an "A."
It's a set in which the setter

fakes to the outside, getting the
blockers in motion, before set-
ting it behind her head for the
middle blocker to, as Cross says,
"Take that ball to pound town."
Both middle blockers are

waiting for Dannemiller to per-
fect this play, but they are confi-
dent it will come in time. No one
can be sure what this is all going
to amount to, but it is clear that
Rosen has a definitive picture in

his mind.
For now, it would appear that
he has astrong base and all the
toppings to make this a delicious
season, though only time will
tell.

Notre Dame will be massive test for Wolverines

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
If the Michigan men's soc-
cer team is at its best form of the
young season - and seeing as the
Wolverines (2-4-1) are unbeaten
in their last three games, that
seems to be the case - good for-
tune has it that its biggest test is
next.
When the team travels to South
Bend on Friday to take on No. 22
Notre Dame, Michigan coach
Steve Burns hopes his squad has
learned quickly enough - from
its dismal start and its positive

results of late - to pass.
"Notre Dame is a very good
team," Burns said Wednesday.
"We know that their game is
going to pose some problems for
us."
The Fighting Irish (2-1-2) are
entering a treacherous portion
of their schedule with a visit to
Michigan State later this week-
end followed by a tilt with nation-
al power Louisville on September
24.
With those matches, as well as
Big East play lying ahead, Notre
Dame knows it can't afford to
make mistakes similar to the ones

the Fighting Irish made in a dou-
ble-overtime loss to Saint Louis -
their lone defeat thus far.
But, like Notre Dame, Michi-
gan's success of late has oppo-
nents struggling to figure out its
tactics.
With just two more non-con-
ference battles before Big Ten
opponents begin fillingthe sched-
ule, the Wolverines are playing
much more confidently than they
did to start the season -- when
goals were hard to come by.
In fact, Michigan is coming off
of its highestscoringoutput of the
season in a 4-1 win over Detroit on

Wednesday. During that match, Burns doesn't think the Wol-
junior forward Etienne Lussiez verines need to look farto find an
opponent that parallels the Fight-
ing Irish's intensity and physical-
ity - traits that have them picked
"Their game to finish second in the Big East's

par able.
pose problems p"They're a lot like George-
town but they probably have a
for us. little more depth," Burns said,
"They've got a great midfielder
and a legitimate four up front."
Michigan goalkeeper Adam
scored his first career goal. And Grinwis will be tasked with stop-
second. And third. ping that talented Notre Dame

attack. Junior midfielder Dillon
Powers, in particular, can cause
significant problems roaming the
center of the pitch. On the other
end, it seems that opportunities
to get past Fighting Irish senior
netminder Will Walsh will be
few.
So when a chance does pres-
ent itself for the Wolverines
- whether via a sophomore mid-
fielder Fabio Villas Boas Pereira
strike or a sophomore forward
Malcolm Miller run - Michigan
simply has to take advantage.
"They don't give up a lot of
chances," Burns said.

Running backs will get chance to shine against EMU

September17, 2011: Eastern Michigan

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
running backs were supposed to be
an asset this year.
Five different backs - redshirt

Michael Cox, Eastern
senior Michael a

back Denard Rob-
inson said at Big
Ten Media Day in
late July. "Hopkins is the big back,
Shaw has the speed and the moves,
you got Vincent Smith with quirks
and shakes....You gotMike Cox. It's
goingto be crazy."
But two games into the season,
the running backs are a concern.
Toussaint grabbed hold of the start-
ing position against Western Michi-

gan and delivered, tallying80 yards
and two touchdowns on 11 carries.
But in the process, the injury-prone
back hurt his shoulder, sidelining
him for the Notre Dame game last
week. Shaw took over the starting
duties against the Irish but did little
to convince anyone he should be the
No. 1 back, as he lost three yards on
two total carries. Hopkins had five
carries for just 10 yards and a fum-
ble. Smith has been a solid third-
down back but no longer appears
to be in the running for the starting
job.
"Of course I am (concerned about
the running backs)," said Michigan
offensive coordinator Al Borges
after practice on Tuesday. "But
I'd be more concerned about them
if they had more carries and you
weren't getting the yield that you
wanted."
But against Eastern Michigan
on Saturday, the backs should have
a chance to tally up a significant
number of carries - at least in
comparison to the limited number
they've seen so far, which is in part
due to the rain-shortened game
against the Broncos and partly due
to the Wolverines' inability to put
together a sustained drive against
the Irish.
"The first game, we had a chance

to get them rolling a bit," Borges
said. "They weren't doing too bad.
But (against Notre Dame), we just
found one heck of a time getting
into any rhythm. When you're not
rhythmic, you're not getting first
downs, you're not converting third
downs, you don't get the turns, and
you don't get the snaps."
Toussaint leads the running
backs with just 11 total carries.
Shaw has six, Hopkins five, and
Smith three. On Saturday, each one
could have the opportunity to sepa-
rate himself from the pack against
an inferior Eastern Michigan team.
If Michigan can build a sizable lead
in the first half, each back should
get his touches - possibly even
freshmen backs Justice Hayes and
Thomas Rawls.
"It will always depend on how
fast they learn, maturity-wise,
and all those things," Hoke said of
the freshmen. "I think they're OK.
Depending on where we get, they
may play."
But while the Wolverines should
clearly have the edge over the
Eagles overall, the Eastern Michi-
gan run defense is one of the team's
biggest strengths and could present
a challenge for Michigan.
The Eagles have allowed just
41.5 yards per game on the ground

in their wins against Howard and
Alabama State and have notched
10 total sacks. Eastern Michi-
gan's early success should give the
Michigan running backs even more
incentive to prove they can perform
well against a solid defense.
And while it will be up to the
running backs to perform, it'll also
be up to the offensive line to prove
that they can help the backs be suc-
cessful.
"I'd like to think (the running
backs' struggles is on us) 100 per-
cent," said redshirt sophomore
offensive lineman Taylor Lewan.
"I would like for (Toussaint) or

Shaw or anybodythat's runningthe
ball to be able to walk through the
hole rather than have to squeeze
through."
The running backs should get
their carries Saturday, but Lewan
and the Wolverines are still focused
on what's most important.
"I think Eastern Michigan is a
good team," Lewan said. "They're
not ateam to overlook at all. That's
the truth. Every Saturday is an
opportunity to get a 'W' and to
make our record even better. And at
Michigan, it's 10 wins ayear,11wins
a year that we want. Anything less
than 11,12 wins a year is a failure."

Welcome to week three. If you saw that finish coming last Sat-
urday, please raise your hand. Now put it down and stop readin
this paper. You're simply too smart for us. Denard Robinson's
226-yard fourth quarter was about as unexpected as Jeremy
Gallon becoming a hero by the end of the game. After two wee
of extraordinary football, is this when "normal" returns?

2011 Schedule

Western Michigan (Sept. 3): Good thing the
ks rain came. And the blitzes, too. Looked like Greg
Robinson was coaching until the second quarter.
an
Notre Dame (Sept. 10): Nothing to see here.
Michigan rallied with a 28-point fourth quarter
to stun the Fighting Irish and get the victory.
Eastern Michigan (Sept. 17): Another meeting
with another inferior neighbor: may be Michi-
gan's only shot to hang 50-plus points in a game.
San Diego State (Sept. 24): Hoke said it was
hard leaving his players behind at San Diego
State. They were mad he didn't say goodbye.
Minnesota(Oct.1):MarQueis Gray played wide
receiver last year - now he's the quarterback
and the only thing exciting about the Gophers.
Northwestern (Oct. 8): Dan Persa - that's
about it.

Michigan State (Oct. 15): Edwin Baker and
Le'Veon Bell ran over and through Michigan last
year, and Kirk Cousins ain't too shabby either.
Little Brother's growing up.
Purdue (Oct. 29): Guard your ACLs! The knee
injury has plagued Purdue the past two seasons.
Quarterback Rob Henry was the latest victim.
Iowa (Nov. 5): The faces change, but it always
seems like Kirk Ferentz finds the same types of
° players. This is just another solid Iowa team.
Illinois (Nov. 12): Nathan Scheelhaase-to-A.J.
Jenkins and Jason Ford is the whole offense.
Consider Scheelhaase a poor man's Denard.
Nebraska (Nov. 19): The legendary blackshirts
make their debut at the Big House. By the time
Jared Crick and Co. leave, it may get ugly for 'M.'
Ohio State (Nov. 26): No Tressell? No Pryor?
Ohio State's still deeper than Michigan, but a lot
could change by Thanksgiving.

Hopkins's parents fell inlove with Jackson. Jackson con-
vinced Hopkins to take a visit. Jackson talked to Hopkins's
high school coach, Bryan Erwin.
Is he tough? Does he work hard? Does he show up to
practice on time? How are his grades?
When the formal part was over, Erwin shut the doors. In
the five years Erwin has known Jackson, Coach J always
has to get on the grease board. Marcus runs the I-forma-
tion. Jackson knows all about it. He got on the board and
talked through plays for hours. Wherever he goes, he still
teaches like a quarterback.
"We've gone through a lot of grease cans," Erwin said.
This is building relationships. This is recruiting. No one
does it better than Coach J.
Darryl Stonum, Troy Woolfolk, Brandon Herron, Carvin
Johnson and Terrance Robinson, among others, are all his
guys. Royce Jenkins-Stone, a linebacker in Rivals.com's
Top 100 prospects, has committed to play for Michigan
nextyear.
He's a Jackson guy. Super-recruit Shane Morris, one of
the best - if not the best quarterback - in the 2013 class,
has already verbally committed to the Wolverines. He's a
Jackson guy.
"Recruiting is the name of the game," said Wheatley,
now the running backs coach at Syracuse. "Michigan
wouldn't be Michigan if you don't get the players in there
to continue the Michigan man tradition, to put the butts
in the seats, fill that thing up, 111, 112,(000) whatever it is.
"Add up the number of backs and the yards that he's
coached over the years and then the players that he's
brought in over the years, I would say that's pretty much,
you've got to keep that guy."
Starting with Rick Leach, Jackson learned from Bo. He
sells the same tradition to the kids and coaches that Bo sold
to him. He builds relationships on the trail the same way
Moeller built a relationship with him. He recruits the way
he was recruited.
The method isn't a secret. If you step into his office on
a Thursday morning and ask, Jackson will give you a pre-
view.
"I know Ican sell this place as well as anybody," Jackson
said. "I've known about this place since the '70s."
The rest is right out of Boo textbook.
'This is Michigan. Whatever you put in this article
you've gotto knowthatchat's what I sell kids. This is Mich-
igan. This is not any other school.
"Like Bo said, 'Those who stay will be champions.' You
feel like you're a champion here."
.He continues on. The academics, the life in Ann Arbor,
the stadium, the tradition, Fielding Yost, Gary Moeller,
Lloyd Carr.
It's nothing new. But hearing it this time was different.
Jackson looks you in the eye when he says it. His pace was
steady, his words forceful but ringing of truth. You have no
choice but to believe him.
"My dad has got a way of talking to young men," Fred
Jr. says.
As a young man Fred Jr. was on the receiving end of
those talks. Now 35, he coaches football at Flint Northern
High School. Last year his running back, Thomas Rawls,
broke 2009 Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram's Flint-
area single-game rushingrecord.
Jackson paid a visit to his old stomping grounds. He
made his pitch. Word got out.
"When (Iowa) found out my dad was seeing him, they
were like, 'Man, I might as well lay off. Coach Jack got a
hand on him, that's it,'"Fred Jr. said.
But there was one recruit Jackson handleddifferently.
That one provides a window into the other side of Fred Jack-
son's tenure at Michigan. He's not the reason Jackson sur-
vived or became indispensible. But more so than Jackson's
love for Michigan, the recruit is the reason he's stayed.

CHAPTER SIX
Jeremy Jackson got to play the position Fred Jr. didn't.
He got a lot of things Fred Jr. didn't.
While Pops still worked long hours during the fall and
missed football games, he came home at night. To see his
son, Jackson had to drive a few miles, not across state lines.
When Jeremy was growing up, Jackson began his suc-
cess at Michigan. Lloyd Carr took over as head coach in the
summer of 1995 and named Jackson the offensive coordi-
nator in addition to running backs coach. Carr trusted him.
After two seasons, Jackson lost the offensive coordina-
tor job. He was named assistant head coach. During that
time, more opportunities arose - Sunday football was call-
ing.
"I had opportunities to coach in the NFL numerous
amounts of time," Jackson said. "I mean like eight, nine
times and I didn't go because I wanted to coach here."
In the most unstable of professions, the Jacksons found
stability. They had bought a house in Ann Arbor. Jeremy,
the oldest son of Jackson and his second wife, Teresa, was
growing up. Josh came along. The wife was happy. The kids
were happy. Jackson was at the only college he had every
wanted to coach at.
But the allure remained. This was the highest level, the
top of the coaching ladder. Could Jackson start all over,
leaving his house and family all over again to chase another
objective?
No. He was going to be there for Jeremy and Josh.
"I think he wants to coach in the NFL," Fred Jr. said. "I
think he really does, butI think he's stayingbecause of his
kids."
"I had the
opportunities
to coach in the NFL
numerous times."
Jackson still works long hours and misses events. That's
the nature of the job. He told AnnArbor com he saw about
"a fifth of what Jeremy did as an athlete in high school."
But he lived under the same roof, and that was more than
he could say for Fred Jr.
Jeremy took Pops' advice. He became a receiver. With
the help of Jackson and former Michigan coach and cur-
rent tows wide receivers coach Erik Campbell, who had
coached Jeremy since he was young, Jeremy developed into
a Division-I prospect. Offers started rolling in.
LSU coach Lea Miles, who coached with Jackson when
the two were at Michigan, wanted him down in Baton
Rouge. Campbell wanted him at Iowa.
"That bothered me when they offered him," Jackson
said. "I mean, I thought there was a chance."
But this was Coach J's son. Might as well lay off.
There was no pitch, no question about becoming the
next great Michigan receiver. For all of his life, Jeremy had
seen his dad live the moments of the Michigan program:

Fred Jacksonand son Jeremy never had to sit down and talk about
Michigan during Jeremy's recruitment.
Biakabutuka's 313 yards, Charles Woodson and the 1997
national championship, Braylon Edwards in triple over-
time against Michigan State. Having a sit-down in the liv-
ing room wasn't changing anything.
"I never told him a thing," Jackson says.
"There wasn't much for him to really tell me," Jeremy
added. "I pretty much knew."
CHAPTER SEVEN
Jackson's shot at the NFL is fading fast, if it's not gone
entirely. He's in his fourth decade asa college coach. Now
coaching with his old buddies, Hoke and defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison, he'll remain as the running backs
coach at Michigan, probably for at least the next four or
eight years.
Josh, now 53, is in eighth grade. Already over 6-feet
tall, he may be best athlete of them all. Jackson may have
the chance to see another son through Michigan.
"It's funny now that I'm older, I see my little brothers
and how they are and I'm like, 'oh they're getting all that
hands on,' " Fred Jr. said. "If I would've got it, I would
have been sweet. Real sweet."
Ann Arbor and the Michigan football program have
brought the Jackson family together. Jeremy's a sopho-
more now. Josh will be at Huron High School next year,
about four miles away from Michigan Stadium.
Fred Jr., with a baby of his own, is about an hour up the
road. With him, tucked away in some closet or in some
box in the garage, are those quarterback playbooks Dad
gave him all those years ago.
In a way those books represent the old Fred Jackson:
the man who loved football, wanted to be at Michigan and
was willing to sacrifice his family time to get there.
There's a different Fred Jackson now. There's a differ-
ent relationship with Fred Jr. now. Fred Jr. comes to visit
and it's an event. Jeremy and Josh have to be home. Fam-
ily is here.
That lost time between Fred Jr. and Dad in those early
years has been found.
"When I was younger, I wasn't with him every day like
my mom," Fred Jr. says. "Now, it's like I've got unlimited
access to him and maybe t'm livingsa childhood a little bit
with him. ButI don't mind that."

MAR
Sophomore wide receiver Jeremy Jackson saw his dad live the historic moments of Michigan football. Now he's part of it. H
Michigan's 14 games since he joined the team.

playoff victories. They were the best team in Flint history.
Jackson's lack ofsize scared off Division-I teams schools.
After a brief stint as a walk-on wide receiver at Western
Michigan, he transferred to Jackson State. His playing
career over, questions still lingering.
What if Dad had been around? How would Fred Jr.'s
football career be different if he wasn't miles away?
"When I was playingI did feel like if I had Pops around it
might bea little bit different," Fred Jr. said. "I did feel that.
But I think my whole thing and why I had success playing
quarterback in high school is because I wanted to impress
him.
"I guess you can pin it both ways."
Jackson returned in the middle of his son's high-school
career, taking the job at Michigan. But by then Fred Jr.
didn'thave much time left to develop and Jackson was con-
cerned with figuring out a way to make this the last stop on
his journey.
He had finally achieved his dream of coaching at Michi-
gan, but there was an added incentive to stay. .
"I think part of it was because myself and my sister was
here," Fred Jr. said.
CHAPTER FOUR
Coach J stood in between stretching lines on a Tuesday
practice. It was a sunny day and he was wearing a baseball
cap and his trademark sunglasses. He hovered over junior
Vincent Smith, cracking jokes.
It's here where he finds the special ones. After 20 years
he knows what he's looking for: toughness, smarts, and "an,
inner will that wouldn't allow them to think anything you
did physically would stop them."
It usually takes a year to figure out, but the way Jack-
son sees it, there's no mistaking it. Tyrone Wheatley, Tim

Biakabutuka, Anthony Thomas, Chris Perry, Mike Hart -
they all had it.
Once he finds it, he can get started.
"You've got to coach the special guys - who you think
may be special - in a different way," Jackson said. "You've
got to treat them all fair, but you don't necessarily have to
treat them the same."
Before arriving at Michigan, Jackson had coached quar-
terbacks all his life. If he always wanted to come to the
school he always wanted to coach at and try to figure out a
way to stay close to his kids, he had to take over a position
he knew little about.
"I'm going to coach
them just like
I coach the
quarterbacks."
He worked with Burton on learning the finer points of
the position, like blocking. After two weeks, he understood
the technique. Everything else, he already knew.
"I realized after coaching quarterbacks all these years,
coaching running backs, to me, was the easiest thing I
could do," Jackson said. "I said I'm going to coach them just
like I coach the quarterbacks in terms of knowledge."
The special ones already knew how to run. Teaching

them the technique wasn't too hard. Blocking was more
about mentality anyway. They just had to know who to
block. Reading a defense and knowing which players are
likely to be blitzing isn't much different from what a quar-
terback had to see.
With Wheatley, Jackson's first test case, it worked.
"I never liked getting in the huddle because I knew all
the signals," Wheatley said. "I knew what the audibles
were so I just never liked getting in the huddle. I kind of
stood back there. I would see the same thing the quarter-
back saw."-
Wheatley was an All-Big Ten first team running back
three times. Tim Biakabutuka became All-Big Ten the fol-
lowing year. Three others followed suit, ending with Mike
Hart.
The time away from Fred Jr. and Tonya coaching quar-
terbacks at Toledo and Navy and Vanderbilt wasn't wasted.
All that time spent studying blitz schemes and quarterback
check downs turned Fred Jackson into one of the premiere
running backs coaches in the country.
"He sees everything," Hart said. "He knows exactly
what happens on every play. ... I think as much success as
he's had, you have to respect him. He's not one of those
guys where you say, 'Oh, well this guy's only had one run-
ning back."'
The time away got Jackson to Michigan, back to his
children. Now, through Moeller, Carr, Rich Rodriguez and
Hoke, it's one of the reasons for his longevity.
"He's a good coach," Biakabutuka said. "Any new coach
that comes in, the head coach, can realize that."
CHAPTER FIVE
Coaches can't create talent. They develop it. But if an
assistant coach wants to stay employed, he better find it.
Coach J knows that better than anybody. More so than
his coaching, it's the reason Rodriguez enabled years 17, 18
and 19, despite Jackson not knowing anybody on the coach-
ing staff.
Back in 2009, Jackson needed another running back
for the 2010 class, so he traveled down to Texas, the place
where he'd spent years convincing some of the state's best
players to spurn burnt orange or crimson and cream to don
maize and blue.
Stephen Hopkins was a downhill runner for Marcus
High School. When he rushed for over 1,500 yards his
sophomore year, colleges started calling. When he did it
again his junior year, so did Michigan.

Fifth-year senior defen-
sive tackle Ryan Van Ber-
gen has been through a lot
of change at Michigan.
He came to Ann Arbor
under the direction of Lloyd
Carr, paced the defensive
line through the Rich Rodri-
guez era and now he head-
lines Brady Hoke's front
four on defense.
Van Bergen spoke with
the media on Monday,
fresh of the Wolverines'
stunning victory over Notre
Dame less than 48 hours
earlier:
The Michigan Daily: How do
you balance enjoying that win and
how it doesn't do anything for you
facing Eastern Michigan?
Ryan Van Bergen: You enjoy
it. Saturday night we enjoyed it.
Sunday we watched some film and
enjoyed the highlights. Then it's
time to move on. Eastern's a good
team, they're 2-0 for the first time
in a longtime. We've got to prepare
for them, and we've got to play a
game Saturday.
TMD: How different was it
coming out of the tunnel Saturday
night, under the lights, as opposed
to noon or 3:30?
Van Bergen: It was really
weird. The tunnel is dimly lit any-
way and the field looks like it's
daylight because of the lights. The
atmosphere was just crazy. I've
never heard the Big House that
loud. We were watching film on
it, and the cameras were shaking.
You could barely see the game at
some points because it was so loud
that the stands were moving.
TMD: You've been through
these comebacks before, a couple
against Notre Dame and against
Wisconsin back in 2008. Did you
draw on them? Did you talk to
other guys to keep the faith when
it was looking so dire at some
points?
Van Bergen: We just know we
have the players who are capa-
ble of making plays. If you have
Denard Robinson on your team, 30

seconds is plenty of time to score
a touchdown. He can run 100
yards in under 10 seconds, so you
don't need to worry about 30 sec-
onds being on the clock. Denard
Robinson can take the ball down
himself, and he's got receivers that
can make plays - as you can see -
one-on-one they're dangerous. We
didn't ever give up as a team. We
persevered, it's something we've
talked about all off-season.
TMD: When you see wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon that wide
open on the wheel route on the
sideline, what's that like when you
see it develop?
Van Bergen: Well I didn't see
it because Gallon is 5-(foot)-6 and
everybody else was in my way.
I saw it on the JumboTron and
I couldn't believe it. I'm looking
and trying to find out where their
defense is because he's running
still and he got to the sideline.
And then we're down around
the 25-yard line, and I'm a good
friend of Brendan (Gibbons), and
I know he's going to make the
field goal. And then coach Borges
throws a pass to Roy (Roundtree).
I can't believe he caught it; I just
fell down. I think I chest-bumped
Dave Brandon. It was just a great
experience, it was awesome.
TMD: What's that like, chest-
bumping Dave Brandon?
Van Bergen: "It was kind of
interesting because I was going
for it and I don't think he knew.
You're making eye-to-eye contact,
you start gathering for the jump,
you've got it timed out. You prac-
tice this kind of thing. We didn't
rehearse this. You could tell that
he's kind of rusty, but I think he'll
come around."
TMD:Are you aware that you're
now off scholarship?
Van Bergen: No, he seemed to
enjoy it.
TMD: The defense locked down
pretty well in the fourth quar-
ter; so how disheartening was it
when they walked right through
the defense to take the lead again
inside 90 seconds?
Van Bergen: We didn't com-
municate as well as we needed to
in that kind of situation. It was a
great learning experience for us.
Luckily it didn't cost us that game.
We need to look back at it and see

what things we can improve on,
because two-minute defense is the
most pressure-packed situation
in the game. We've got to be good
there. Our offense scored, we need
to hold onto that win for them.
TMD: On the flip side, talk
about recovering the fumble just
minutes earlier.
Van Bergen: I didn't know what
happened because I was rushing
the passer. I thought I saw the
ball out of the corner of my eye,
and I wasn't sure, but then it came
squirting through the line. They
were in the red zone, if they would
have scored there, who knows
what the outcome of the game
would've been? That was a big play
for us. All I really did was fall on
the fumble. F
TMD: You've created and
secured more turnovers this year.
What's been the difference there?
Van Bergen: Emphasis. In prac-
tice, we emphasize that regardless
of what the tempo is. If we're in
shoulder pads or not, we're always
trying to strip the ball from our
backs. If there's incomplete passes,
we're always scooping and scoring
those in practice. Every ball that's
on the ground is our ball.
If you look at turnovers, that
decides a lot. The top of the AP
charts are the teams that get the
most turnovers and have the big-
gest turnover margin. We haven't
been at the top because of that
reason. If you look at it now, we're
probably creating some of the most
turnovers in college football.
TMD: You've had fast starts the
last couple years, and you've only
played seven quarters, but does
this 2-0 start feel different than
the last couple years?
Van Bergen: I feel like every
year has felt different. This year's
felt different just because we're
2-0, and one game was called
because of rain and the other came
down to the last two seconds. It's
been a rollercoaster already and
it's only been two games. We'll
find out where we are with this
next game ... we want to come out
and be dominant and have a good
all-around game, because we have
not put one together that we've
been successful in all three phas-
es. If we can do that, then I'll start
thinking it's a different season.

COACH J. AND CO.
Why running backs coach Fred Jackson has stayed at Michigan for the past two decades
By Michael Florek

corner behind his desk. An un-hung picture rests gently on a
cardboard box.
Jackson and Bo are standing on the field of Michigan Sta-
dium. The picture was taken in 1989, Bo's last year, just before
Jackson and Purdue took on Michigan.
Jackson reaches behind the box and pulls out another
picture. It has a slight yellowish tint to it. It's old but there's
no mistaking who it is. It's Bo standing on the sideline, with
slicked back chestnut hair.
"Look at how young he looked," Jackson says. "You know
what year that is? That's '74."
It was Bo who taught Jackson, a young kid from Louisiana,
what Michigan stood for. It was Bo who brought him here.
After playing quarterback at Jackson State, Jackson came
to Flint, Mich. because of a program that brought minority
educators to the Midwest. Flint Southwestern Athletic direc-
tor Dick Leach hired him as an assistant football coach and
biology teacher. He would coach track and basketball, too.
A year later, Leach's son Rick was in his junior year at
Southwestern and was already one of the top recruits in the
country. Michigan State was all over him. Arizona, Stanford,
UCLA, Colorado and many other major colleges in the nation
wanted him.
"If you don't take
this job, we're never
going to offer you
another job."
That included Bo Schembechler and Michigan. Leach was
the perfect fit for any offense, but especially Schembechler's.
He had the speed to run the option and the arm to make the
defense pay for defending it.
Leach hadn't yet made a commitment when Bo turned to
Southwestern's barely-out-of-college assistant coach.
"Are we going to get Leach?"
"Yeah, you'll get him," Jackson told him. "His family is
Michigan. He's Michigan."
Leach signed. A relationship was born. Bo kept coming back
and kept selling his passion for Michigan to Jackson and his
recruits. Players like Gary Lee and Brian Carpenter spurned
the best recruiting efforts of then-Illinois defensive coordina-
tor Lloyd Carr to sign with the Wolverines. Then-Michigan
defensive coordinator Gary Moeller took a liking to Jackson
and began teaching him. Any time Jackson had a question, he
would call Moeller. Gary always answered it.
Barely into his coaching career, Jackson already found his
objective.
"I knew this: I always wanted to coach in college football,"
Jackson said. "I wanted to coach at Michigan."
Separated from his first wife, the journey began in 1979
when he became the offensive coordinator, quarterbacks
coach and wide receivers coach at Toledo. Three-year-old Fred
Jr. and his older sister Tonya stayed in Flint with their mother.
Thirteen years after Bo Schembechler got that Leach guar-
antee, Jackson was well on his way to achieving his goal. He
was the offensive coordinator at Wisconsin when Bo called
him again.
Michigan's wide receivers coach had just left. Did Jackson
want the position?
This was Jackson's chance. He could bring everything full

circle, go to place that was sold so well to him and his players.
He could work with the people who taught him, be closer to his
family. But he was the already an offensive coordinator - one
step away fromthe top of the coaching ladder. You don't volun-
tary step down a rung.
Jackson turned it down.
Six years later, Bo was long retired as head coach, but he
never stopped recruiting. After leaving Madison, Jackson
bounced from Navy to South Carolina to Purdue to Vanderbilt.
He was the quarterbacks coach with the Commodores when
Bo called again.
Longtime running backs coach Tirrell Burton has just
retired. Head coach Gary Moeller wanted Jackson to have the
job. This time Bo had leverage.
"If you don't take this job," he told Jackson, "we're never
going to offer you another job."
CHAPTER THREE
Fred Jackson Jr. was fed up.
As his dad chased his dream, Fred Jr. was stuck in Flint.
Spending summers throwing the football around wasn't
enough time together. He was going to stay with his dad.
Mom was havingnone of that.
"She wanted me to be with her," Fred Jr. said. "I'm her only
son. I understand now. I didn't understand then."
Those backyard throws and catches would have to suffice
for a few more years. In those days, Fred Jr. was always the
receiver. His dad was the former college quarterback, after
all. Jackson had played at Jackson State, handing the ball off
to Walter Payton during his senior season. The Philadelphia
Eagles gave Jackson a shot, but cut him not long after.
Jackson still had enough pop in his arm to throw the ball
repeatedly to his son as they tried to scrunch their bonding
time into the short summer months before fall camp started
in August.
"I didn't talk to him as much, it was either late night when
he got home, or if he could shoot me a quick call during the

A

CHAPTER ONE
"Do you want to be the next Michigan running back?"
It wasn't so much a question as a recruiting pitch.
Fred Jackson was in Double Oak, Texas. Tall, with a mus-
tache fading into his cheeks, at 61 the wrinkles are there, but
only if you look for them. In his deep, booming voice he asked
this question to 17-year old Stephen Hopkins.
Jackson knew how loaded it was. He created its meaning.
Entering his 20th year as Michigan's running backs coach,
Jackson has groomed five of the top-10 career rushing leaders
in school history. His backs have been named All-Big Ten 10
times. He's been responsible for over 35,000 yards rushing.
This is the other part of hisjob - recruiting.
The Wolverines offered Hopkins a scholarship in Febru-
ary of his junior year. Four months later, at Michigan's spring
game, Hopkins officially answered Jackson's question and
committed.

"Following the people that have been here already, people
that have already played here, it wasn't reallythat hard," Hop-
kins said before this season.
At a school ripe with history, the mystique of the Michi-
gan running back Jackson had spent his life's work creating
had just landed him another recruit. And unlike most of the
countless other players Jackson has recruited, Hopkins is in
his position group. He gets to mold Hopkins into the player
his mind sees him to be.
It's the perfect intersection of what Fred Jackson does:
coach and recruit. For the past two decades, with four dif-
ferent head coaches, he's done this donning a block 'M' on
his chest, even if it was in his heart long before then. In pro-
fession known for its nomadic ways, Jackson has gone from
Tyrone Wheatley to Mike Hart, finding and molding the next
great Michigan running back.
"Coaching with Fred and watching him develop backs and
how his kids play on a daily, weekly basis, there's no better
running backs coach in the country," Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said.

If his coaching allows him to survive, his recruiting makes
him indispensable.
Logic says with a resume like that, Jackson shouldn't be a
running backs coach. The coaching ladder says the best posi-
tion coaches become coordinators. The best coordinators
become head coaches. The ladder used to matter to Jackson.
He spent most of his career running across the country, try-
ing to finda way to the next rung.
Now, it doesn't mean much. Jackson's set it aside for a
peaceful house and a chance to catch a few more Pop Warner
football games.
Why hasn't he left? The answer begins with a quarterback
from Baton Rouge becoming'Coach J.' It ends with 'Pops.'
CHAPTER TWO
Twenty years later, Fred Jackson hasn't fully moved into
his office. Papers are scattered on an end table in the back

day or something," Fred Jr. said.
During those fleeting moments in June and July, it wasn't
any different from a typical father-son relationship. As far as
football, Jackson had some advice.
"Always be a receiver," he would say. "If you want a schol-
arship or if you want play at the next level in the pros, they
take more receivers than they do quarterbacks."
But as Fred Jr. entered high school, he had no choice. His
coach had heard of his dad's successes. Jackson was a quar-
terback. Jackson's son was going to be a quarterback. It didn't
matter that Fred was 6-foot and barely 155 pounds.
Jackson, well into his coaching career at this point, knew
how to make up for some of the lack in size. He started feed-
ing his son quarterback playbooks. He provided him with
inspirational quotes and related everything to football.
Knowledge makes you better.

Weathers, Fred Jr. took the 1994 Flint Central Indians to two
