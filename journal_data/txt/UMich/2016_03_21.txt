SCIENCE
Study finds 
Twitter can 
show scope 
of disasters

Researchers find 
social media can 
predict how much 
public aid is requested

By DESIREE CHEW

Daily Staff Reporter

A group of researchers, includ-

ing one from the University of 
Michigan, have found that social 
media could help the public and 
emergency 
responders 
gauge 

how much damage was inflicted 
following a natural disaster, and 
subsequently predict the amount 
of relief funds given to the com-
munity following a natural disas-
ter.

The study found a moderate 

positive 
correlation 
between 

Twitter activity in an area and 
the level of damage inflicted by 
Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Engineering Prof. Pascal Van 

Hentenryck initiated the proj-
ect as part of his optimization 
research on how better predic-

tive models can be used to study 
complex infrastructure, natural 
phenomena and human behavior. 

Van Hentenryck said the idea 

for the research came as he was 
looking for alternatives to exist-
ing mechanisms currently used 
to assess and predict damage 
to power networks and electric 
generators caused by natural 
disasters.

“One of the issues that I was 

dealing with at that point was 
the assessment and repair of the 
power system,” Van Hentenryck 
said. “How can we use social 
media to refine the prediction of 
damage of the network? Maybe 
it can give a better estimation 
of what is down and what is not 
down.”

This curiosity about forming 

predictive methods for damage 
to electricity networks created 
the starting hypothesis for the 
research study.

“We wanted to find out if there 

is some correlation between 
Twitter activity and the dam-
age inside a power network. The

‘The Vagina Monologues’
explores female sexuality

Fourth annual 
performance 

discusses sexual 
assault, asexuality

By MADELEINE GERSON 

Daily Staff Reporter

“The Vagina Monologues”— a 

performance featuring a series of 
comical, inspiring and powerful 

acts that aim to deliver women’s 
stories of sexuality and courage to 
the public — was held at Rackham 
Auditorium Friday and Saturday 
night.

Students, 
faculty 
and 

community members gathered for 
the Students for Choice’s fourth 
annual 
student-run 
program, 

held by Students for Choice and 
directed by LSA junior Angelle 
Antoun. Many of the performers 
presented monologues from Eve 
Ensler’s 1996 play of the same 

name, which served as inspiration 
for the event, but two others prese

nted their own stories.
Among 
the 
speeches 

throughout the night, a myriad 
of perspectives were explored, 
from the old and young, to 
heterosexual, homosexual and 
transgender, among others.

“My Vagina was My Village,” 

from Ensler’s play, was presented 
by Art & Design senior Manami 
Maxted. It tells the story of a 
woman living in a war zone 

who was systematically raped by 
soldiers.

“There is something between 

my legs. I do not know where it is, 
what it is,” Maxted recited. “Not 
since they put their dirty sperm 
inside me. Not since a piece of my 
vagina came off in my hand. They 
butchered it and burned it down.”

BUSINESS

New restuarant 

focuses on 

sustainable, local 

ingredients

By BECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

Inspired by small health food 

cafes in California and New 
York, local resident Fred Lelcaj 
is bringing a new healthy flavor 
to South University Avenue 
with a new restaurant, Fred’s, 
which officially opened its doors 
Thursday.

The menu includes smoothies, 

acai bowls and juices, bagels, 
avocado toast and sandwiches.

In an interview Lelcaj said 

he has been in the restaurant 
business his whole life and has 
gained 
valuable 
experience 

in the operations side of the 
industry through working with 
his sister, Sava Lelcaj, at her 
restaurant Sava’s on State Street. 
He said his passion for organic 
and wholesome food, paired with 
the necessity of a cafe catering to 
the market of college students 

in Ann Arbor, motivated him to 
found Fred’s.

“The lack of a concept like this 

has really encouraged me to want 
to open here,” he said. “I saw 
a demographic imperative for 
something like this, especially 
in this neighborhood. We get a 
lot of people from California or 
New Jersey or New York in these 
bigger cities that are geared up 
for places like this.”

Lelcaj said Fred’s strives to 

give their customers a completely 
satisfying experience every time 
they enter their store: from the 
food, to the interactions with the 
employees, to the aesthetics of 
the building.

“I want everything to make 

you feel good,” Lelcaj said. “I 
want everything to bring you 
this calming sense, and the 
feeling that you have made the 
right choice and come to the 
right place.”

All of the food’s ingredients 

are 
carefully 
sourced 
and 

organic, Lelcaj said, adding his 
belief in sustainability is a big 
driver behind the restaurant. 
They are very meticulous about 
all of their ingredients to ensure

Ann Arbor suggested 
as one explanation 
for drug-friendly 
survey results

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan ranked sixth highest 

in the nation and the highest in 
the upper Midwest for enthusiasm 

about marijuana, according to a 
survey published by online blog 
Estately last Monday.

The rankings are based on five 

criteria including the number 
of reported marijuana users per 
state, affordability of high-quality 
marijuana, number of marijuana-
related Google searches per capita 
and state marijuana laws, as well 
as the number of subscriptions 
to marijuana-related Facebook 
groups.

The information was compiled 

from a broad range of sources. 
To determine the number of 
marijuana users in each state, 
Estately used data compiled by 
theSubstance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration. 
The cost of marijuana in each state 
came from the user-submitted 
website, priceofweed.com. Data 
from 
Facebook, 
and 
Google 

Trends was used to determine 
statewide interest in marijuana. 
The survey also drew from the 
New York City-based nonprofit 
organization, 
Drug 
Policy 

Alliance, for information about 
individual state’s drug laws.

Michigan 
legislators 
are 

considering legalizing the drug, 
but use of marijuana in Michigan 
is 
currently 
illegal. 
Medical 

marijuana however, is legalized in 
the state.

All of the states who ranked in 

the top slots are notable for their 
recent legalizations of marijuana 
for recreational use. Colorado 
was ranked #1, followed by 
Washington and Oregon. Alaska, 
the most recent state to legalize 
recreational marijuana, was the 
only state with similar policies 
to be ranked outside the top 10 at 
12th. 

Ryan Nickum, the author of 

the Estately article, pointed out 
most states that rank highly tend 
to border states that also display 
an enthusiasm for marijuana. 
Michigan and Wisconsin, Nickum 
noted, were outliers from this 
trend. 

In his state-by-state analysis 

of the 10 highest ranking states, 
Nickum made a specific reference 
to the University of Michigan. 

“You have to go all the way 

back to 2011 to find a year when 
Michigan was ranked this much 
higher than Ohio, but that was 
in football, not weed (University 
of Michigan ranked 12th, Ohio 
State University was unranked). 
Michigan tops Ohio (20th) in 
these rankings because medical 
marijuana is legal, as opposed to 
just decriminalized like in Ohio.” 
Nickum wrote in the report.

BRE AKING IT DOWN

University of Michigan 

football coach Jim 
Harbaugh took on a new 
role this weekend — actor.

During the musical Big 

Fish, put on by MUSKET!, 
the University’s student-
run musical theatre 
organization, Harbaugh 
sat in the audience for 
most of the show, but then 
took to the stage when the 
cast needed a little extra 
help.

Harbaugh didn’t 

have any lines, but his 
role included handing 
a football helmet to the 
main character, Edward 
Bloom. Though his time 

on the stage was only 
about 5 minutes, when he 
took and left the stage, the 
audience gave a vocal and 
loud applause. 

Big Fish is a musical 

adapted from a book and 
movie, following the 
journey of a father and son 
as they grapple with the 
father’s ailing health and 
the son’s search for the 
truth about his father’s life 
as he sifts through stories 
his father has told.

Harbaugh took to 

Twitter prior to the show 
to express his excitement 
about it, noting that his 
son, LSA freshman James 

Harbaugh, was in the 
show and his family would 
be attending all three 
showings of the musical.

MUSKET! also 

tweeted their excitement 
for his involvement in the 
musical.

After the show, 

students were enthusiastic 
online as well, thanking 
Harbaugh for his 
participation.

The show took place 

over a span of three days, 
with Harbaugh featured 
in every performance.

Restaurant Café Zola offers a 
unique take on brunch foods

Downtown 

location known 
fo its breakfast 

options

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Walking into Café Zola, the 

atmosphere 
is 
unlike 
other 

brunch spots in Ann Arbor — and 
that’s just what they’re going for.

Though many University of 

Michigan students may not be 
as familiar with the eatery as 
spots closer to campus — the 
cafe is near the intersection of 
West Washington Street and 
Main Street — Café Zola, part of 
the downtown Ann Arbor scene 
since March 1996, was busy with 
hungry customers on a recent 
Friday afternoon.

In an interview, manager 

Lucia Lagoy said the loyal, 
returning customers were the 
reason 
for 
the 
restaurant’s 

continued 
success. 
She 

estimated that 50 to 60 percent 
of all customers are returning 
customers, a feat achieved mainly 
through word of mouth rather 
than 
the 
restaurant’s 
active 

advertisements.

“Most of advertising really 

comes from word of mouth,” 
Lagoy said. “We don’t do a lot of 
print (or online) advertising. Once 
you come to eat here, you can’t 
help but talk about it and come 
back.”

Lagoy said the establishment 

only recently became part of 
OpenTable, an online restaurant 
reservation site. The restaurant 
is also now on Yelp, Facebook, 
Twitter and Instagram to attract 
new customers.

But the old customers keep 

coming back, Lagoy believes, for 
the restaurant’s unique menu. 
While Café Zola now calls itself 
as an “eclectic” restaurant, it 
began as a more traditional café, 
serving primarily coffee drinks 
and French pastry dishes such as 
crepes. The name “Café Zola” was 
inspired by French writer Emile 
Zola as the original breakfast and 
lunch menus were largely based 
on French cuisine and culture.

“The eclectic mix of food we 

offer sets us apart from other 
places,” Lagoy said.

Soon after the grand opening, 

co-founders and co-owners of the 
restaurant, Hediye Batu, from 
Turkey, and Alan Zakalik, from 
Poland, consulted with several 

local restaurant owners in Ann 
Arbor to include more dishes 
in their menu. The restaurant’s 
current 
menu 
is 
influenced 

by a variety of cultures in 
addition to French, including 
Mediterranean, 
Italian 
and 

Turkish.

Some of the most popular 

breakfast dishes are Turkish 
Eggs, Crab Cake Benedict, the 
vegetarian Artichoke Omelette, 
Belgian-style waffles and their 
crepes. 
The 
restaurant 
also 

offers a variety of coffee drinks, 
alcoholic 
drinks 
and 
fresh 

smoothies. Lagoy said because of 
the diverse nature of the menu, 
customers could enjoy a good 
range of meals.

“You can come in and have any 

range of meal here,” Lagoy said. 
“It’s a great place to come with 
friends and pick out a few items 
for everyone to share.”

Lagoy said having a large menu 

for a restaurant is a double-edged 
sword, but for Café Zola, it hasn’t 
been an issue. The restaurant 
has won the title of Best Brunch 
in Washtenaw County in 2014 
and was a runner-up for Best 
Breakfast in Ann Arbor in 2014 
and 2015.

hypothesis was social media can 
be predictive, somewhat, of the 
damage done,” Van Hentenryck 
said.

Launched in 2012, the team 

consisted of a variety of scien-
tists, researchers and graduate 
students from five universities. 
Prior to coming to the University, 
Van Hentenryck led a research 
group at National Information 
Communications 
Technology 

Australia. It was there that he 
engaged long-time friend Man-
uel Cebrian as co-author for 
the research project. Currently 
based in Melbourne, Cebrian 
works as research team leader 
at the Commonwealth Scientific 
and Industrial Research Organi-
zation.

Cebrian said using real-time 

data from social media to evalu-
ate complex events that have 
far-reaching and long-term con-
sequences is significant because 
these events are difficult to mea-
sure quickly.

“We wonder if we could actu-

ally do something that would mix 
two very different time scales — 
one that is very slow and take a 
long time to assess, the other one 
would be social media, which will 
be very fast,” Cebrian explained. 
“Natural disasters produce mas-
sive damage; it’s estimated that 
damage takes months to assess. 
When you estimate damage in 
one community, usually what you 
do is send experts, experts con-
duct assessment with technology, 
verify that damage was caused 
by the disaster and it takes some-
times about a year to do this. So 

we asked: can we infer some of 
this from the way people tweet 
during the disaster?”

For the purpose of this study, 

“damage” was quantified by the 
amount of disaster relief funds 
issued by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. The team 
analyzed 52 million geographi-
cally pinpointed tweets posted 
before, during and after the hur-
ricane. In order to ensure that 
tweets were filtered for relevance, 
they searched for keywords such 
as “FEMA” and “hurricane.” 

“We very carefully gathered 

tweets about the hurricane in 
the east coast, and obtained data 
from both FEMA and private 
as well as state-level insurance 
claims,” Cebrian said. “We put 
everything together and then 
started to measure the specific 
correlations between them.” 

Given the large amount of data, 

Cebrian said the team was care-
ful to ascertain that statistical 
results could be reproducible on 
the city, county and national lev-
els.

“The third phase of our proj-

ect looked at the question: are 
the signals robust? We needed 
to make sure that what we found 
was meaningful and reliable. It 
took almost a year to write up the 
results and make sure that they 
are presented in an intelligible 
fashion,” Cebrian said.

The research found that areas 

that tweeted more post-disaster 
filed the most insurance claims 
and received the most individual 
assistance from FEMA grants. 
Similar studies on 10 to 15 other 
disasters revealed the same cor-
relation.

“There is a positive correlation 

between the level of twitter activ-

ity and the damage in a particu-
lar area,” Van Hentenryck said. 
“The interesting thing is that it’s 
not when the hurricane is passing 
through the region, it’s a couple 
of days after. At the peak of the 
event, almost every location will 
have a lot of tweets, even if they 
aren’t directly on the path of the 
hurricane.”

The researchers said their find-

ings are significant because the 
uncovered correlation between 
the volume of tweets and local 
damages is actually stronger 
than those employed by fragility 
simulations currently used in fed-
eral emergency response efforts. 
Nonetheless, Cebrian stressed 
the research findings should be 
used as a complement to, rather 
than replacement of existing 
forecasting and predictive mod-
els.

“We wanted to be very cautious 

about this,” Cebrian said. “Corre-
lation is positive, but moderate, 
can predict some of the damage 
that is going to happen, but not all 
of it. This could be due to the fact 
that maybe we don’t have enough 
data, or maybe Twitter doesn’t 
capture 100 percent of the dam-
age.”

Van Hentenryck said he hopes 

federal emergency services will 
leverage on the predictive poten-
tial of social media, now that this 
peer-reviewed study has been 
published.

“I think emergency services 

would like to tap into that poten-
tial — they don’t really know how 
to do it, they don’t really know the 
reliability,” he said. “For me, this 
is exciting because it gives them 
positive indication that social 
media is another tool that they 
can use.”

Irene Syriac, told the story of 
coming to terms with asexuality 
by comparing her vagina to the 
popcorn button on a microwave. 

“My vagina is my body’s 

equivalent to the microwave’s 
popcorn button,” Syriac said. “I 
never used it and I do not have 
plans to.”

Syriac explained the stigma 

associated with asexuality and 
the lack of awareness surrounding 
the subject during the monologue, 
and related it to the personal 
experience of coming out. 

“Coming out to my parents 

wasn’t all that different from 
telling them that I had a 
mysterious disease,”Syriac said. 
“Telling them I was dysfunctional 
seemed easier than telling them 
I was asexual. My conservative 
upbringing had led me to think 
that it was something I should not 
have been experiencing yet.”

Students for Choice President 

Connie Gao, an LSA senior, 
said she hopes that audience 
members 
will 
be 
inspired 

and continue the discussion 
afterward.

“I hope people think about the 

Vagina Monologues after they 
leave.” Gao said. “I hope that they 
put in that conscious thought.” 

All of the proceeds from ticket 

sales were donated to Operation 
SafeHouse, 
an 
organization 

which 
provides 
emergency 

shelter, intervention and outreach 
services 
to 
youth 
in 
crisis. 

Students for Choice treasurer 
Kelsey Almony, an LSA junior, 
said she wanted to be a part 
of Vagina Monologues initial 
because of its connections to 
SafeHouse.

“I got involved because of the 

donations to SafeHouse,” Almony 
said. “I have some personal 
connections there. It is something 
really close to my heart, which 
is why I am passionate about the 
event.”

LSA junior Sydney McConnell, 

a member of Students for Choice, 
said the purpose of the event was 
to add the perspective of women 
to the conversation.

“Women 
are 
sexual,” 

McConnell said. “They have 

sexual organs and should be 

they are bringing their customers 
the best product, he said.

The open layout of the store 

is also formatted to reflect the 
wholesome 
ingredients, 
and 

increase transparency to the 
customers, he added with the 
ingredients in plain view to the 
customers on the counter where 
the food is made.

“Transparency 
is 
very 

important to me,” Lelcaj said. “All 
of our packages are in plain view 
— you can see what we’re using. 
You can see every increment of 
every single ingredient as we are 
adding it to your food.”

Business 
sophomore 
Sarah 

Wood, a student representative 
for the business, said she is a huge 
fan of the new cafe because of 
its transparency and nutrition. 
She said she believes the new 
cafe will have an impact on the 
food culture of South University 
Avenue allowing a new kind of 
option.

“My personal opinion of the 

food and their unique offering 
is that it’s going to fragment the 
South U food offering,” she said. 
“I think it’s going to incite change 
because they are so dedicated to 
healthy options, so dedicated to 
whole-foods-like quality. It has 
the main street high class feel but 
they are bringing it to South U.”

Engineering 
senior 
Jake 

Fratkin, president of the Food 
Industry 
Student 
Association, 

said he thought this style of food 
will fit well into the culture of 
Ann Arbor.

“It definitely is going along with 

the health food craze that is going 
on,” he said. “It is on the further 
end of that spectrum of being all-
in with sourcing and applying 
sustainable and nutritious food 
that also tastes good.”

Lelcaj said along with food he 

also wants to emphasize positive 
interactions between his team of 
employees and the customers.

“I’m 
not 
hiring 
workers,” 

Lelcaj said. “I’m building a team. 
I’m building a team of individuals 
who are really passionate and 
excited about this. It’s really 
important to me that people are 
familiar with everything we are 
working with and actually taking 
interest. A lot of things that are 
not everyday household items — 
the staff putting it into real terms 
is really important.”

Wood 
noted 
that 
the 

environment of the store is 
something she appreciates.

“From the moment you walk 

in where it is so light, airy, white 
and peaceful, to interacting with 
Fred and (other cafe staff), you 
feel good about every interaction. 
That is something that is so 
amazing about the experience of 
Fred’s,” she said.

their lives only when we actu-
ally go beyond our intuition 
about kids and test ideas,” he 
said.

Smith said the purpose of 

the symposium was to share 
the program’s findings with 
the greater community, spe-
cifically those who have par-
ticipated in studies.

“The thing I think is most 

important about this is trying 
to give back a little bit,” he said. 
“As development researchers, 
we rely heavily on the will-
ingness of families to have 
their kids come and chat with 
us and take part in our activi-
ties. One of the of things that’s 
true about a lot of the academic 
world is that what we end up 
finding never makes it back 
to those people that helped us 
out.”

options for student loans offered 
by 
the 
federal 
government: 

income driven repayment, which 
allows graduates to cap their stu-
dent loan payments at 10 percent 
of their income, and public service 
loan forgiveness, a program which 
allows graduates entering public 
service careers to qualify to have 
their debt forgiven.

King asked journalists on the 

call to inform their fellow students 
of potential loan scams, in which 
companies attempt to charge for 
services the government provides 
at no cost.

“The bad news is I’ve got a 

warning for you too,” King said. 
“There are people out there who 
are looking to take advantage of 
Americans’ anxiety about stu-
dent loan debt and try to charge 
you for services that are com-
pletely free.”

Addressing a question about 

ensuring 
college 
affordability 

for middle-income families, King 
said one of the most important 
aspects is encouraging states to 
provide adequate funding for 
institutions.

In the state of Michigan, high-

er education took a hit in 2011 
when Gov. Rick Snyder cut fund-
ing by 15 percent under his first 
budget. Since then, funding has 
slowly increased. Under Snyder’s 
most recent budget proposal, 
funding for higher education has 
aggregately returned to pre-2011 

levels, though the budget has yet 
to be approved by the state legis-
lature and is subject to change.

Despite this increase, Young 

Invincibles — a youth advocacy 
organization, which publishes 
an annual report measuring state 
support for higher education — 
gave Michigan an F ranking in 
their 2016 report. Additionally, 
Michigan also ranked among 
the highest in family share of the 
cost burden, with families paying 
70 percent of total college cost at 
public institutions.

King said decreased invest-

ment from states has led to 
tuition increases, prompting the 
federal government to encourage 
renewed state funding for higher 
education.

“We’ve been urging states to 

pay careful attention to their level 
of investment in public higher 
education,” he said. “One of the 
things that has driven higher 
costs for students and families 
has been disinvestment by states 
over the past decade, so we are 
pushing for states to make a bet-
ter investment.”

In the 2016 presidential elec-

tion, 
Democratic 
candidates 

Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (D–Vt.) have touted two 
different higher education reform 
initiatives. Clinton has supported 
debt-free college, which would 
allow increased investments in 
higher education to help students 
graduate without needing to take 
out loans. Sanders has proposed 
tuition free college, which would 
cause all public institutions to be 

entirely without cost for all indi-
viduals regardless of financial 
background. Republicans have 
not released formal plans for 
higher education reform.

King denied to comment on 

the 
Obama 
administration’s 

opinion of either of the two plans, 
but did note President Barack 
Obama’s efforts toward free two-
year community college.

“The president has a proposal 

called America’s College Promise 
that would make tuition for com-
munity college for hardworking 
students free,” he said. “For many 
folks community college can be 
a path to a four year program or 
gaining skills for employment.”

LSA junior Taiwo Dosunmu, 

communications director for Col-
lege Democrats, said he feels the 
president has fought to increase 
college affordability, and the two 
Democratic candidates — Sand-
ers and Clinton — both plan to 
continue his work and further 
their own plans.

“The Obama Administration 

has made the affordability of 
higher education a priority since 
early on in the president’s first 
term,” he said. “Both Demo-
cratic candidates for president 
have announced excellent plans 
to continue Obama’s work and to 
help students deal with the chal-
lenges of rising tuition and the 
burden of student debt. The Dem-
ocratic Party is the party that is 
fighting on behalf of students.”

College Republicans could not 

be reached for comment on the 
issue. 

marijuana 
user 
who 
has 

requested 
to 
remain 

anonymous — said the lack 
of social stigma, and sense 
of relaxation are factors that 
contribute 
to 
marijuana’s 

popularity on campus.

“People are likely to smoke 

because they genuinely like 
the feeling they get from doing 
so; also, from my experience 
there really isn’t a stigma that 
comes from doing it at all,” 
he said. “Basically everyone 
I knew growing up did it, so 
there was no sense of, ‘Oh, 
what I’m doing is wrong.’ But 
the main thing is people like 
how they feel when they’re on 
(marijuana).”

The article also notes the 

high popularity of marijuana 
on the West Coast as well as 
the Northeast. By comparison, 
the plains states, as well as the 
Southeastern states displayed 
relatively low enthusiasm for 
marijuana use.

LSA senior Erin Dunne, 

director of the University 
Students for Sensible Drug 
Policy, said the marijuana 
legalization policies in other 
states could be an influence 
on the growing enthusiasm for 
the drug statewide.

“I think that enthusiasm 

is currently growing in part 
because the national discourse 
on marijuana is becoming 
more favorable,” Dunne said. 
“Voters are looking to states 
like Washington and Colorado 
and seeing that there is a 
reality of legal and taxable 
marijuana that is beneficial to 
the state and hoping to bring 
the revenue and industry to 
Michigan.”

Dunne, who is an advocate 

for 
statewide 
removal 

of 
criminal 
penalties 
for 

cultivation, 
possession 
and 

distribution 
of 
marijuana 

except in the case of sale to 
unauthorized 
minors, 
also 

noted Ann Arbor’s relatively 
loose policies on the drug.

“In 
the 
city 
of 
Ann 

Arbor, marijuana has been 
decriminalized, meaning that 
offenses result in a fine and a 
civil infraction rather than a 
criminal charge,” Dunne said. 
“This policy has probably 
benefited Michigan students 
in the sense that those who 
choose to use marijuana off-
campus will not be sucked into 
the court system and have a 
criminal record when applying 
to jobs.”

really great is that it’s huge,” 
Lagoy said. “Sometimes that 
could be a bad thing because it’s 
hard to get everything right. We 
do it really well because there is 
a commitment to making sure 
that the ingredients and recipes 
are high quality.”

Lagoy also cited the high 

quality of the ingredients as key 
to the restaurant’s success. She 
said Café Zola uses local, organic 
produce not only for their dishes 
but also their coffee, tea and 
wine. Lagoy said using good, 
fresh ingredients really makes a 
difference in the final prepared 
dish, citing eggs that come from 
a local Amish farm in Dexter.

“The owners feel very strong 

about staying true to the quality 
of the ingredients,” Lagoy said. 
“We are providing the best 
for our customers. (The food) 
nourishes their bodies without 
feeling ‘ugh.’ Our egg dishes 
taste so good because it’s the egg 
itself that tastes good.”

Lagoy also noted the design 

of the restaurant creates a 
“rustic” ambience that makes 
the customers feel like they 
are not just having a meal with 
their party, but with the rest 
of the restaurant, creating a 
community of diners.

For that reason, Lagoy said 

though the restaurant is doing 
well, she does not want to 
expand the restaurant so much 
that it loses the rustic, cordial 
ambience.

“We always want to build 

our customer base, but we 
don’t want it to become so big 
that we lose what we’re able to 
offer right now and become too 
mainstream,” Lagoy said. “It’s 
a destination place for the food 
and the ambience.”

Medical 
and 
Rackham 

student Anjan Saha, who’s eaten 
at the cafe for brunch, said he 
appreciated the excellent food 
and service despite how busy the 
restaurant was.

“Brunch time on Sunday is 

extremely busy as one would 
expect for a place that is held in 
high regard amongst many in 
AA,” said Saha. “(I) waited at 
most ten minutes for my food, 
which was excellent. Personnel 
were extremely nice, warm, and 
accommodating. Place is perfect 
for group outings, brunch dates, 
or enjoying a nice meal alone.”

In spite of the positive things 

about his brunch experience, 
however, Saha did note that 
the price might be too high for 
students.

“The only knock I have 

against (the restaurant) is the 
price, 
since 
students 
don’t 

necessarily earn the largest sum 
of money,” Saha said.

I 

was 12 years old the first time I broke 
my arm. The next school day, I walked 
into class and all of my friends ran over 

to sign my bright orange cast, ask how I was 
doing and reassure me that they were there 
should I need anything.

I was 13 years old when I was officially 

diagnosed with an extreme case of anxiety 
disorder. Nobody ran over to ask how 
was I doing or to reassure me they were 
there should I need anything. It was not 
something people openly talked about.

I was 18 years old and in the middle of my 

freshman year of college the second time I 
broke my arm. I walked into my sociology 
discussion the next day and several students 
ran over to ask how I was doing and reassure 
me they were there should I need anything.

Around that same time, my anxiety was 

growing day by day and I couldn’t have been 
more unhappy. I felt isolated, alone and sad. 
Nobody was asking me how I was doing 
or reassuring me they were there should I 
need anything. It was not something people 
openly talked about.

I was comfortable talking about any 

visible pain I was feeling on the outside. 
I was not comfortable talking about the 
invisible pain I was feeling on the inside. I 
felt ashamed, embarrassed and disgraced.

This stigma, the stigma toward mental 

health, plays a negative role in my life and 
in the lives of far too many college students 
and others — even from a young age. Only 
recently has the discussion of mental health 
and wellness become something we talk 
about openly.

As I have continued through college and 

my work with mental health advocacy, as 
an incoming Wolverine Support Network 
director and Central Student Government 

representative, has progressed and become 
a passion, I am becoming more comfortable 
telling my story, asking others theirs, 
facilitating small group discussions, and 
talking about internal pain. But sadly, I 
am in the minority. Far too many students 
experience isolation as part of and as a 
result of their internal pain, having nobody 
who will run over to offer a helping hand.

If we can create a campus community that 

fosters acceptance and understanding of all 
forms of illness and encourages students to 
discuss issues that cover all aspects of the 
mental health spectrum, then maybe — just 
maybe — one fewer college student will 
become a statistic. I believe that we need 
to have open discussion and dialogue about 
mental health through this aforementioned 
mutual understanding.

Thanks to the Internet and social media 

outlets, our generation, unlike any other 
before us, has access to the world. We 
have the platform and an audience at our 
fingertips to speak with about issues that 
formerly were not openly talked about. 
Because of this advantage, we should make 
it our mission to take the endless resources 
available to us and work to shatter this 
stigma. It is our duty to be the change, to 
take a stand and to continue to write the 
stories of those who are affected by mental 
health disorders, because failure to do so 
could be putting people’s lives on the line.

Let’s start treating mental health like 

we treat a bright orange cast on the arm 
of a 12-year-old. If not now, when? If not 
us, who?

overnments can create free markets. 
This sounds counterintuitive, but 
there was a time when the Republican 

Party enacted legislation 
and produced regulation 
to protect free markets 
from themselves. When 
was this mythic time when 
parties weren’t ruled by 
dogma? The Progressive 
Era 
during 
the 
1900s 

featured a coalescence of 
parties wherein President 
Roosevelt crafted laws that 
prevented 
corporations 

from acting in predatory 
ways. 
These 
then-new 

statutes enhanced and protected free markets 
rather than undermining them. Government 
intervention is not necessarily the opposite of 
free markets; rather, it can save free markets 
from their auto-cannibalistic tendencies. 
Contemporary 
political 
discourse 
has 

forgotten this lesson to ill effect; it would serve 
us well to dismantle this false binary between 
government intervention and free markets.

A Davidson Parable: Last Thanksgiving, 

my brother and I gorged ourselves on 
guacamole out of a Jeb! bowl (which was 
in vogue at the time*). Our prodigious (or 
horrifying) guac consumption eventually 
attracted the attention of our cousin, Tim, 
who came over and told us that we needed 
a free market intervention so that he could 
enjoy some. But is that what really needed to 
happen? Or had my brother and I created a 
monopoly that shackled the rest of the world 
with its sheer force? If this was the case, 
then antitrust laws would be appropriate. 
To speak in platitudes, it’s a matter of 
perspective. My cousin saw the issue as 
one of sprawling, unchecked state control, 
while from our vantage point, the problem 
lay in our private consolidation of power. 
One more platitude: Any system can become 
oppressive when it expands beyond control.

***
One common claim within socialist and 

anti-capitalist discourse is that capitalism 
only cares about profit. This is part of a larger 
attempt of these parties to claim a monopoly 
on morality. The connotation of the word 
“profit” is crucial here; it is a pecuniary, 
material word. When socialists discuss 
their belief system, they highlight abstract, 

normative values such as equality rather 
than anchor it to material good. However, 
capitalism does have normative values — 
growth, for instance. Promoting growth 
and redistribution are equally moral goals. 
Capitalists would do well by themselves 
to remember that and use growth as a lens 
when making policy decisions or within 
more everyday political discussions.

There is a second narrative that claims 

capitalism is antithetical to social welfare. 
Capitalism has a focus on growth rather 
than equality, which, at first glance, doesn’t 
seem to align with the collective good. 
However, the primary driver of this growth 
is competition between businesses. Can this 
competition create social good? The United 
States’ private sector has been a leader in 
medical advances for much of modern history. 
Unlike other Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development nations that 
have socialized medicine, we have given 
individual businesses the higher position. 
These companies have competed for greater 
profit, which has continually advanced our 
medical knowledge and saved lives. 

This is not a blanket defense of our medical 

system. The incentive structure of medical 
research businesses has changed and now 
there is a much greater focus on paying out to 
shareholders than there is on groundbreaking 
research. The fact that the United States has 
more citizens uninsured than any other OECD 
country is unacceptable. Martin Shkreli’s 
— and by extension the pharmaceutical 
industry’s — ability to raise the price of a life-
saving HIV drug 5,000 percent overnight 
should not be tolerated.

All 
things 
considered, 
the 
broader 

business model of acquiring copyrights 
and patents but not developing them 
in a meaningful way is one of our 
system’s most egregious failings. By not 
essentializing the government’s role in a 
capitalist country as either regulating and 
curtailing free markets or deregulating 
and encouraging free markets, we can have 
a more meaningful conversation about 
how to restore competition and equality of 
opportunity in America.

enough nor ironic enough to own a $75 Jeb!

Not a binary

T

his 
past 
week, 
I 
was 

reminded of a powerful 
concept. It is rooted in 

this quote from 
the film “V for 
Vendetta”:

“We are told 

to 
remember 

the idea, not the 
man, because a 
man can fail. He 
can be caught, 
he can be killed 
and 
forgotten, 

but 400 years 
later, 
an 
idea 

can still

 
change 
the 
world. 
I’ve 

witnessed firsthand the power of 
ideas. I’ve seen people kill in the 
name of them, and die defending 
them.”

In other words, the powerful 

concept is the gravity of an idea. 
Ideas have the capacity to create 
and destroy, to bridge reality with 
the imaginary, and will outlive 
any one individual. 

In political terms, our state can 

simply be viewed as just that: an 
idea. And, since it is an idea, the 
state can morph into whatever 
form we construct. 

In the United States, the idea of 

our state largely rests on a Dream. 
You’ve heard it before. It goes 
something like this: Get educated, 
work hard, buy a home and a car 
and live in harmony.

I recently met two people who 

had fully adopted this mentality. 
The first was a Mexican-born 
American. He drove a city bus in 
San Diego at night and worked a 
second job during the day. When 
we spoke, he derided many people 
who took his bus. In his mind, they 
did not seem to work hard or work 
at all. They were given much and 
took it all for granted. They “stunk 
of weed” and mostly remained 
vessels of untapped potential.

The second man had worked 

as an IT manager. He complained 
about 
paying 
for 
Obamacare, 

which he saw as something that 
made him sacrifice his health care 
for others’ (even after explaining 
that he didn’t actually pay more 
because his wife benefited from 
the new health care plan). Still, he 
did not want to pay for something 
that 
he 
thought 
in 
no 
way 

benefited him. He did not want to 
pay for other people’s health. 

Neither of these individuals 

believed that they owed anything 
to the state because the state had 
given them nothing. The state 
stayed out of their way and, in 
return, they were able to succeed 
as they saw fit. Within this 
ideological framework, it would 
be an injustice for them to pay for 
others — paying for something 
that didn’t directly benefit them 
was unfair. This is the American 
Dream. 
Take 
nothing. 
Earn 

everything. Do it yourself. 

Our Dream never quite made 

sense to me. In truth, it has 
appeared to be more like a myth. 
Oftentimes, the term myth is 
preferred to describe the United 
States’ belief system since it masks 
or excuses what would otherwise 
be considered corruption, abuse or 
institutional injustice. 

From what I’ve learned, I 

know a state to be “an imagined 
community” of people with a 
specific boundary and a united 
goal. 
I’d 
like 
to 
emphasize 

one word in particular in this 
working definition: united. This 
word implies we all are invested 
in one another’s future. On a 
large scale, it means the actions 
of one person are not trivial or 
inconsequential to the actions 
you make. We are all connected.

Though the idea of statehood 

is tied to a definition, it is still 
an idea. In this vein, we can 
ascertain that a state can morph 
into anything (or need not even 
exist), as the physical laws of the 
universe do not bind it. That is, 
there’s nothing that necessitates 
a United States, Pacific Ocean or 

South America. 

In fact, there has been a 

choice (often by force and most 
frequently by white males) to 
divide the land and sea. Within 
these 
divided 
boundaries, 

there have been more choices 
to 
allocate 
resources 
and 

opportunities 
within 
these 

boundaries to differing groups 
of individuals. There is nothing 
biologically — inherently, based 
on nature — different about 
these groups of people. But 
even now, specific groups have 
become stratified, so much so 
that some groups of individuals 
are exceedingly better off, on 
average, in each country around 
the world. The American Dream 
has masked this story in the 
United States. 

Optimistically, however, our 

state could change tomorrow — 
if enough citizens so desired.

With an altered mindset, the 

amount of stratification, inequality 
or otherwise difference between 
these 
socially 
constructed 

groups could be closer to zero. 
Economically, 
politically 
and 

socially speaking, every individual 
could 
live 
more 
equal 
lives 

depending on how our constructed 
state allocates its resources. But 
this can only be true if we are to live 
in a place where citizens believe 
themselves to be part of a united, 
integrated cause. 

Unfortunately, I did not discuss 

the American Myth with the 
two men I had recently met. 
Personally, I did not have the 
energy to expend, explaining how 
we are united by systems that 
should progress every ones way 
of life. I could have accomplished 
something, though, if I’d only 
asked two questions: What is your 
idea of a state? And, how (and to 
whom) should it distribute its 
resources?

S

ometimes, in nameless dark 
spaces, I like to think about 
life after death. I do this 

because it strips 
events and goals 
of their messy 
impermanence 
and 
helps 
to 

place them in 
a broader per-
spective which, 
by and large, is 
a 
worthwhile 

exercise. 
Of 

course, 
for-

mally speaking, 
there isn’t much 
for the dead after death. But every 
single time I conduct this argu-
ably morbid exercise, I get this 
strong sentiment — a hazy, extrin-
sic desire that, once my days were 
written and closed, I be remem-
bered.

This seems odd. I had long felt 

I understood the futility of find-
ing self-worth or value in exter-
nal elements — the pointlessness 
of material goods, status, excess 
riches. Logically, my mind under-
stood that there is nothing post-
death. All that matters is what’s 
happening now, as it always has 
and always will, and I knew this. 
We aren’t the ones who preserve 
our post-mortem legacy. So why 
bother worrying about it? But I 
just couldn’t shake this desire, I 
could not shake this near-primal 
want to be remembered. How 
could I achieve this less-often val-
ued sort of legacy? How could I be 
remembered?

My father loved telling me 

about my grandfather. My appu-
pa 
— grandfather in my Malay-

alam tongue 
— was still a small 

boy when his father passed, but 
old enough to remember it. His 
character exuded diligence in 
both thought and action, and he 
eventually served as a lieutenant 
colonel in the Indian Army, where 
he ended up working for decades. 
He worked tirelessly to give those 
close to him a good life, both inside 

and outside the home. He worked 
with the will of a man wanting 
to give his sons a life better than 
he ever had. I know this because 
of the countless stories my father 
proudly told me. I remember my 
appupa as a tall man with grayed 
hair, who always stood as if he 
was aware yet humble of his own 
deeds. It may have been many 
years since he passed, but I still 
remember him.

While I might have only heard 

about my appupa’s life, I witnessed 
much of my father’s. I saw him 
wake up early every day; I saw him 
work and pray and cry and shout 
and smile. I was there for all his 
anger and honesty, all his pain 

and his love. I was there for all the 
stories, adventures, sacrifices and 
everyday happenings. My father 
made many sacrifices, most of 
which I will never hear about or 
understand because of the age gap 
between us. When I was a child, 
most of what my father did went 
unappreciated, but not unnoticed. 
I would come to realize that he, 
like his father before him, worked 
tirelessly for something larger 
than himself. I didn’t only hear 
tales through the ages; I was there. 
I saw my father living his life, try-
ing to be a good man.

Legacy, as it turns out, is not 

ordained by fame or fortune. It is 
purely about remembrance — at 
any scale. I know that in a few gen-
erations, my name will most likely 

be forgotten. There’s nothing to 
be done but to accept that fact. 
I can, however, take heed of my 
forefathers. They were men like 
any other: anxious, burdened, sad, 
afraid. But what matters is that 
they worked past that, they went 
beyond their own mortal aches 
and did whatever they could to 
ensure something better for those 
around them. They will not be for-
gotten for that.

We will be remembered with-

in our families and through our 
children. We will be remembered 
through the tales we tell one 
another before bedtime. We will 
be remembered through tender, 
comforting memories, in times 
both dim and merry. True, this 
isn’t a grandiose legacy. There 
won’t be parades or speeches or 
poems in our honor. But even if 
it is just for a little while, we will 
live on.

Sometimes I dream of the day 

I would get to hold my baby son 
tightly to my chest. I would pray 
that I never have to let him go. 
I’d well up and smile and look at 
a face too pure to live in this hor-
rible, cruel world. I’d hold a hand 
so tiny that it could barely wrap 
around my finger, a hand I’d hold 
and keep safe for as long as I pos-
sibly could. And as I sit there with 
him, it would dawn on me that 
my life was no longer solely mine. 
The reins have been handed over 
to this little child whom I would 
gladly protect and provide for.

Truth be told, I cannot wait to 

be with my child, standing with 
him through all the good times 
and bad, making sure he is doing 
fine and telling him that every-
thing will eventually be all right. 
I cannot wait to tell my son about 
my appupa, the resolute army man 
who always stood tall. Most of all, 
I cannot wait to tell him about my 
father, and how he was not only a 
good man, but a great one.

‘The Americans’ 
raises the stakes

The best TV show 
you’re not watching 

showcases all its 

great pieces

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

There’s a moment in the 

season four premiere of “The 
Americans” which subtly shows 
exactly 
what 

the 
show 
is 

about. 
The 

camera shows 
a 
classroom 

saying 
the 

Pledge 
of 

Allegiance. It 
moves 
back 

into the hall, 
where it finds 
Paige 
Jen-

nings 
(new-

comer 
Holly 

Taylor). She’s 
waiting for the pledge to finish 
with a sad look on her face, torn 
between the identity of her Rus-
sian parents and the country she 
grew up in.

Scenes like this are what make 

“The Americans” one of the best 
damn dramas on TV right now. 
For three seasons now, the show 
has built its story out of bits like 
this one. It took its time to lay 
the groundwork and to build up 
its characters. Now, as it moves 
into the series’ fourth season, 
it’s taking everything it built and 
running with it. The premiere 
raises the stakes for the charac-
ters and lands some gut punches, 
all while operating with brilliant 
and careful visuals.

Season four of “The Ameri-

cans” picks up where season 
three left off, showing the rami-
fications of Paige telling her 
pastor about her parents being 
Russian spies, as well as her 
mom, Elizabeth (Keri Russell, 
“Felicity”), taking her to East 
Germany to see her grandmoth-
er against orders from the Cen-
tre. As a consequence for their 
actions, their handler (played 
with gravitas by Frank Langella, 
“Frost/Nixon”) forces them onto 
their most dangerous mission 
yet: handling a chemical which 
the Soviets are intending to wea-
ponize.

At the heart of the premiere, 

though, 
is 
Philip 
(Matthew 

Rhys, “Brothers & Sisters”). In 
the premiere, he flashes back to a 
moment in his childhood where 
he beat a bully to death with his 
bare hands, and later struggles 
with it during the Erhard Semi-
nars Training session he attends. 
Rhys deserves so much of the 
credit for making this work. 
He continues to find ways to 

layer Philip’s pain as he tries to 
cover it up in front of his family. 
When Philip does open up at the 
seminar, Rhys brings so many 
emotions to the table that it’s 
impossible not to feel for him.

Martha (Alison Wright, “Blue 

Bloods”) has her struggles while 
dealing with her husband (Philip 
under another name) killing one 
of her co-workers in the FBI. 
Martha has been one of the most 
tragic figures of the series, hav-
ing been manipulated and lied 
to by Philip without any knowl-
edge of what’s happening. Last 
season, the consequences of 
her husband’s actions started 
to catch up to her, and that con-
tinued in the premiere. Wright 
has made her mark as an actress 
building out this character, and 
showing her struggles with her 
husband’s identity.

Everything in the show is 

deliberately shot by the bril-
liant television director Thomas 
Schlamme (“The West Wing”). 
At this point, the series’ visual 
aesthetic is so ingrained in its 
DNA, and the premiere con-

tinues this trend. Whether it’s 
tiny scenes like Paige in the hall 
or Philip looking up at a pos-
sibly broken vial of a poisonous 
chemical, everything Schlamme 
does adds so much to a scene that 
blunt dialogue isn’t necessary.

Few other shows could make a 

moment like Paige standing out-
side the classroom land this well. 
There’s no dialogue, but it still 
says everything about her char-
acter’s arc and how she’s feeling. 
The drama has put together so 
many tiny pieces that now it can 
just play with them, making for 
some of the best television you’re 
not watching.

Response: Hitler is 
fair game for comedy

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Sarah 
Silverman 
went 
on 

“Conan” as Hitler last Thursday, 
and it was only kind of funny.

Daily Arts Writer Shir Avi-

nadav, in her well-argued piece 
“When funny fails: Sarah Silver-
man as Hitler,” made the point 
that what Silverman did, dress-
ing up as Hitler and bemoaning 
the Donald Trump comparisons 
between the two, was out of the 
bounds of acceptable comedy. 
While I agree that the skit was 
misguided at times (the exchange 
at the beginning when Conan 
tells “Hitler,” “You’re the worst,” 
and Silverman replies “I know, I 
know” felt forced and, yes, trivi-
alizing) I have to disagree that 
the skit in its entirety was out of 
bounds.

It was certainly jarring to see 

the man responsible for mass 
genocide appear on late-night 
television — particularly because 
he was greeted with resounding 
applause. Silverman often tends 
to concern herself with break-
ing the boundary of what we can 
and “cannot” talk about, and the 
Conan skit is a clear example of 
her edgy jokes. For the countless 
families who suffered from the 
Holocaust (at this point it seems 
necessary to mention my own, 
which in some twisted way adds 
credibility to these sort of dissent-
ing articles), there will never be a 
point when the Holocaust is “OK.” 
And there never should be.

That doesn’t mean, though, 

that we shouldn’t address it, or 
even humor it. It’s paramount that 
we refuse to allow Hitler’s mem-
ory to remain in the past, lest we 
risk such a tragedy again.

As Avinadav’s article aptly 

points out, “A joke is a very seri-
ous thing.” Even with the guise of 
casualness that she brings to all 
her jokes, there is an acute aware-
ness of this in Sarah Silverman’s 
satire. When she, acting as Hitler, 
compliments Trump by saying 
“this guy gets it,” she makes light 
of the comparisons, sure. But she 
also, on a deeper level, encourages 
us, whether we like it or not, to at 

least take a look at the similarities 
between the two.

Some have been offended by 

the very comparison itself, argu-
ing that it is demeaning to Hitler’s 
victims. I’m not so sure. It’s no 
doubt hyperbolic rhetoric, and I 
don’t think that Donald Trump is 
anywhere near the level of Hitler, 
who was far more intelligent and 
crazed. But the tide of support 
that he has received for suggest-
ing a ban against Muslims and 
demonizing Mexican-Americans 
is nevertheless frightening. I can’t 
begin to imagine what it feels like 
for those groups to see this rhet-
oric unfold in the 21st century, 
especially in a country like the 
United States, which spouts free-
dom and liberty as its very foun-
dation. Raising the red flag and 
pointing out the history strikes 
me as preventative, not offensive.

When we say that using Hitler 

in comedic situations is off-limits, 
since he must be a special case, we 
run into the dangerous territory 
of trying to parse through who 
and what are special cases, what 
makes them so and when, if ever, 
they stop being so special. Take 
Bill Cosby, for example, who was 
joked about frequently in the last 
two years following the reveal of 
the breadth of his sexual assault 
claims. Some were aghast that 
comics would even approach such 
a subject — rape can’t be funny, 
can it?

Well, it depends. Just as it does 

when approaching the Holo-
caust, 9/11 and everything else. 
Treated with the right amount 
of irreverence, the right lens and 
offered with the right irony and 
self-awareness, these dark and 
somber subjects can be enlighten-
ing and even amusing. Hannibal 
Buress did a great job showcasing 
this in his fierce monologue about 
Bill Cosby.

“Bill Cosby has the fucking 

smuggest old Black man public 
persona that I hate,” Buress said. 
“He gets on TV, ‘Pull your pants 
up, Black people, I was on TV in 
the ’80s. I can talk down to you 
because I had a successful sitcom.’ 
Yeah, but you rape women, Bill 
Cosby, so turn the crazy down a 

couple notches.”

Not only did it elicit a power-

ful response — and laugh — from 
his audience, but also a power-
ful response from the media, 
and soon Bill Cosby’s horrifying 
actions were again brought to 
the attention of the public, this 
time for good. Such is an example 
of when irreverent comedy and 
shocking elements work together 
successfully and actually evoke 
change. Are we to berate Hanni-
bal Buress for this?

This isn’t to say that Bill Cosby 

and Hitler are similar at all, but 
rather to point out that too often 
when we attempt to make these 
determinations we end up with 
our backs against the wall, try-
ing to figure out which groups 
suffered more than others, who 
is evil enough to chide, when it’s 
“too soon,” etc. These are ques-
tions that, like the term “accept-
able,” have little place in comedy. 
Rather, we should be determining 
what is funny and what isn’t, not 
what’s OK and what isn’t.

Still, humor is subjective, and 

while there’s not, in my opin-
ion, so much a limit on what is 
“acceptable,” there’s at least a 
minimal level of nuance that good 
comics need to approach contro-
versial topics in a way that will get 
the laughs they crave.

Take Larry the Cable Guy as an 

example of when poor taste ruins 
humor. His jokes are crass and 
often incorporate some level of 
subtle sexism or racism (“I dated 
this retarded woman once, but we 
broke up. We couldn’t agree on 
anything. I’d say ‘tomato,’ she’d 
say ‘bowling shoes!’”). They aren’t 
funny to the majority of the public 
today because they feel antiquat-
ed, rooted in a society that we no 
longer ascribe ourselves to. Now 
that the public is more cognizant 
of those issues, it isn’t funny to 
hear an old white dude pretend 
they don’t exist.

And you could argue that Sarah 

Silverman’s impression of Hitler 
simply wasn’t funny. That’s totally 
subjective and OK. For some, like 
the author of “When funny fails,” 
Hitler will never be funny.

But he’s still fair game.

S

omewhere in a closet 
in suburban Chicago, 
there’s a hole-punched 

dossier containing 13 years of 
my private history. Growing 
up, at the 
beginning of 
every school 
year I had 
the privilege 
of filling out 
the “about 
me” book 
my mom so 
presciently 
put together 
for my future 
perusal. 
The book 
documented what sports I pre-
tended to like that year, what 
milestones I reached — what 
kind of little person I was 
becoming. If you were to flip 
through the book, you’d see 
13 sets of the same questions 
scribbled on the record: Who 
are your best friends? What 
music do you like? Who do you 
want to be when you grow up? 
The last one, especially, had 
some embarrassing answers. 
In fourth grade, I thought “ice 
cream taste tester” would be a 
hilarious thing to put down. At 
age nine I wanted to be a “pop-
star,” a job that I think I’d excel 
at to this day. In kindergarten, 
I wrote that I wanted to be the 
first female President.

I knew who Hillary Clinton 

was at that point, because it 
was 1999 and she was all over 
the news. She was the news. 
Five-year-old Chloe knew that 
Hillary was the President’s 
wife, which was really cool, 
because she got to live in the 
White House and visit schools 
and wear pretty dresses. Hill-
ary was also beginning a politi-
cal career of her own, which 
I was vaguely aware of and 
found even more impressive 
than the dollhouse life she 
was leading in the wake of her 
husband’s fame. Hillary was 
the coolest person I’d heard of 
aside from my mom and Brit-
ney Spears, and I wanted to be 
just like her.

Somewhere, unwritten in the 

pages of my “about me” book, 
Hillary became uncool. As an 
ambitious woman, I’d always 
admired her career and sympa-
thized with her stances, but as 
we both got older I gravitated 
toward supporting other politi-
cal figures. In 2008 and 2012 
I appreciated the inspiration 
Barack Obama brought to every 
TV debate, my state senator 
galvanizing the masses with 
unabashed calls for reform. A 
year or so ago I decided Bernie 
Sanders’s focus on environ-
mental issues was imperative 
enough to get me to ignore 
other voices. Clinton spoke 
with solidity and experience, 
but I was secretly all about the 
flash and coolness factor Ber-
nie always brought. What can I 
say? I was a weirdo millennial 

girl, and I liked my presidents 
how I like my popstars: punch-
ing with panache, the coolest 
people I’ve heard of aside from 
my mom and Alex Turner from 
the Arctic Monkeys.

Today, I pride myself on 

pragmatism and informed deci-
sions. I may have flip-flopped 
on my preferences since last 
year, but my own political 
beliefs aren’t the point. I am 
a TV columnist, and I’m not 
here to convince you to support 
one Democratic candidate over 
another. This column is usu-
ally a space for me to show my 
readers what’s cool on TV and 
point them toward interest-
ing discussions. Do you know 
who was really cool on TV 
last week, to my surprise and 
delight? Hillary Clinton.

Clinton’s public persona is 

built on steadiness and solid-
ity. She is a Serious Candidate, 
the one many Republican vot-
ers are afraid of, all power 
suits and codified plans. But 
she’s also a little too solid and 
steady, according to her detrac-
tors, some of whom hold a 
candidate’s coolness in highest 
esteem. Can you picture Clin-
ton smoking a joint, letting her 
hair get frizzy in the summer 
heat or letting out a cathartic 
yas kween? Is she passionate, 
does she yell at the podium 
and throw her hands around 
like she owns the air in the 
debate room? No. She stands 
tall, speaks her mind, delivers 
her message without adorn-
ment or coolness. When she 
does attempt youthful flair, as 
she did with her timely “may 
the force be with you” closing 
statement in the Dec. 19 debate, 
she is mocked for trying too 
hard to be down with the 
young people. Trying too hard 
isn’t cool.

When I first heard that Hill-

ary Clinton would be guest 
starring on “Broad City,” I 
figured this move might be 
a genius fix to her perceived 
dearth of coolness. In 2014, 
“Broad City” debuted on Com-
edy Central to the highest rat-
ings the network had ever seen 
with viewers aged 18-34. The 
show is still among the most 
relevant and beloved series on 
the air among people my age; 
nearly all my friends are fans of 
the show.

Prior to the Clinton episode 

of “Broad City” airing, star and 
co-creator Abbi Jacobson said 
at SXSW that the politician’s 
appearance was “not trying 
to make a statement.” “Broad 
City” is a TV sitcom, and it’s 
not here to convince you to 
support one Democratic can-
didate over another. But even 
if the statement the show is 
making isn’t overtly political, 
there’s still a statement to be 
made. Hillary Clinton is cool.

Clinton’s name doesn’t make 

an appearance in that “Broad 
City” episode until the last 

eight minutes of the episode, 
but as soon as her name is 
uttered, the episode shoots 
off into total nutso territory. 
When Ilana finds out she’s not 
just delivering a package to 
an office building, but Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign offices and 
that she could work here, Ilana 
loses her shit. The conveniently 
placed eagle poster behind 
her soars, a heavenly chorus 
sings and Ilana salutes the desk 
receptionist as her hair blows 
back.

Hillary Clinton is momen-

tous, the very picture of Ameri-
can patriotism. She wins the 
admiration of Ilana, another 
ambitious child of the ’90s 
who grew up hearing Hillary’s 
name and thinking of female 
American badassery and honor. 
The camera cuts away from the 
close-up, the music cuts out 
and it turns out some interns 
are just moving the poster past 
Ilana’s head — but the state-
ment has already been made. 
Ilana freaks out to the secre-
tary with her signature weird 
diction: “Ilana Wexler and 
Hillary Clinton? Two powerful 
whemen wherking as whon?!”

Even if this whole episode 

has a surreal, dreamlike feel 
and there’s no possibility of 
Ilana and Hillary ruling the 
world together, the show draws 
a parallel between our favorite 
weed kween and the dignified 
woman campaigning to lead 
our country. Two powerful, 
cool women working as one.

In a later scene, Ilana and 

her new campaign co-workers 
list off all the demographics 
Clinton appeals to and her 
policies would benefit: a vote 
for Hillary is “a vote for the 
working class,” and she is the 
candidate who best represents 
people of color and LGBTQ 
voters. So obvious in its politi-
cal stance, there’s no way this 
scene isn’t meant to be another 
moment of serendipitous sur-
realism. After all, this is the 
same episode where Abbi farts 
during a chiropractor visit and 
he kisses her on the forehead 
like a kind grandpa. Hillary is 
cool with being the butt of a 
joke or two, especially in her 
brief cameo scene at the end of 
the episode.

When Clinton finally 

appears, she walks out in slow 
motion, staring at the camera 
like a boss lady who doesn’t 
give a fuck about a male gaze. 
Abbi and Ilana shake their 
heads with mouths agape. Stop 
what you’re doing, it’s Hill-
ary Clinton! Clinton winks, 
and there’s a ripple across the 
screen and some sparks go 
off behind her ear. Ilana can’t 
do anything aside from yell 
“YASSS.”

Of course, Clinton’s main 

TV experience is standing on a 
stage with cameras trained on 
her, keeping a rehearsed smile 
and planning everything she is 
going to say — it’s not surpris-
ing that her comedic perfor-
mance is a little awkward. But 
“Broad City” downplays that 
by grounding her appearance 
in the kind of weirdness that 
viewers have come to expect 
from “Broad City,” the cool 
surrealism that draws young 
viewers like myself and my 
friends to this show like moths 
to a flame.

Hillary Clinton is no 

stranger to using celebrity to 
spotlight her campaign. There 
are countless photos, most of 
them heavily documented on 
my Twitter account, featur-
ing Clinton standing with TV 
actresses like Anna Gunn and 
Padma Lakshmi and popstars 
like Britney Spears. But per-
haps the coolest move of all is 
guest starring on a show that 
would put her face on every 
young person’s laptop screen 
and remind them that she’s not 
just a powerful whoman and a 
role model — Clinton can have 
fun and be weird.

‘Broad City’ reminds

LÉON is the electro-
soul singer you need

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

As Spring Break depressingly 

came to a close, I realized that my 
cheerful and upbeat playlists just 
weren’t doing it for me anymore. 
With the return to school and the 
unhealthy number of essays I had 
looming over my head, I went on 
the hunt for a more appropriate 
sound. This long and winding road 
led me straight to LÉON.

Self-proclaimed as “indie-pop/

soul/whatever,” LÉON was born 
and raised in Stockholm. Born into 
an extremely musical family, her 
mother is a symphony cellist and 
her father is a conductor/compos-
er. While music has always been a 
large part of LÉON’s life, her debut 
EP, Treasure, wasn’t released until 
recently, on Dec. 3, 2015. The most 
popular song, “Tired of Talking,” 
received widespread success and 
currently sits with just under 16 
million streams on Spotify.

The opening track, aptly named 

“Treasure,” starts us off with 
a dense drumbeat and sensual, 
heavy breathing before introduc-
ing LÉON’s vocals. It combines 
electronica elements like sound-

boards and artificial background 
vocals with LÉON’s original, uned-
ited voice. With unusual sounds of 
chains and clicks, she speaks of 
lost love and defeat, singing, “All 
of the times that you fucked my 
head / Go and do it with another 
instead.” It’s a strong start to the 
EP and begins a story that LÉON 
continues throughout the piece.

“Tired of Talking” begins slow-

ly, showcasing LÉON’s vocals with 
background snaps and electric gui-
tar riffs. One of my favorite musi-
cal elements of the EP comes right 
after the chorus, when the sweet 
whistling moves to the forefront. 
It’s simple and used sparingly, but 
adds just the right amount of senti-
ment to an otherwise quick-witted 
song. LÉON sings, “I’ve been noth-
ing but good to you / Your howling 
into the night won’t do,” focusing 
on moving on from a past love and 
rebuilding again.

Bringing in a more electronic 

vibe, “Nobody Cares” deals with 
mistakes and running away. In 
the most cynical song on the EP, 
LÉON brings her narrative of 
being wronged full circle when 
she sings, “Nobody cares about us 
/ Guess you can know that I still 

do.” With more echoes and fewer 
traditional instruments, the bridge 
sounds subdued and muted, like 
the listener is getting into LÉON’s 
mind.

“LÉON’s Lullaby,” my personal 

favorite track, slows things down 
and shows off LÉON’s vocal range. 
It’s simple and mature, with just 
her electric guitar and soothing 
vocals. She sings, “My friend / Take 
me to a place I know that I have 
never been before / My love / You 
take me to the place I’ve only heard 
of.” The song is a longing, power-
ful and deeply personal account of 
asking someone to stay. While the 
chorus is bluesy and soulful, laced 
with desperation, the bridge plays 
with distorted and darker instru-
ments to create an ethereal piano 
and circus-like sound. It’s a poi-
gnant and elusive way to end the 
EP, leaving the listener with the 
feeling that something is not quite 
right and not quite finished.

LÉON may be most well-known 

for “Tired of Talking,” but Trea-
sure has some hidden gems just 
waiting to be discovered. With a 
consistent storyline and experi-
mental techniques, LÉON’s EP is 
just the beginning of her journey. 

FILM REVIEW
Righteous anger, loss 
fills ‘No Más Bebés’

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Imagine you’re in a hospital, 

about to deliver a baby. You’re in 
labor — the pain is excruciating. 
You’ve 
been 

told that you 
need a cesar-
ean section, so 
you’re 
pushed 

into the sterile 
hallway on a 
gurney, a team 
of masked med-
ical 
residents 

rushing around 
you. 
One 
of 

them 
holds 

a piece of paper in one hand, a 
syringe in the other.

He offers you the shot: it’ll take 

away the pain. Before he injects 
the numbing medicine, however, 
he pushes his paper under your 
shaking hand, demanding that 
you sign the consent form first. 
You can’t read the paper; it’s 
written in a foreign language and 
your eyes are blurred from labor 
anyway. You sign on the line; the 
pain lessens.

Then you’re wheeled into the 

room where you’ll unknowingly 
deliver your final child.

Such was the harrowing expe-

rience of hundreds of poor, pre-
dominantly Mexican-American 
mothers at the Los Angeles Coun-
ty Hospital in the 1970s. “No Más 
Bebés” (or “No More Babies”), a 
documentary released last June 
and shown at the 2016 Ann Arbor 
Film Festival this month, tells the 
story of 10 women whose fallopi-
an tubes were cut without their 
consent after giving birth in L.A. 
The film follows the 1975 lawsuit, 
Madrigal v. Quilligan, in which 
the women sued L.A. doctors for 
forced sterilization — a landmark 
case in reproductive rights for all 

women, regardless of race or eth-
nicity.

“No Más Bebés” begins where, 

for too many women, their story 
ended: in the maternity ward of 
the now-abandoned L.A. hospi-
tal. Maria Hurtado, one of the 
original plaintiffs, surveys the 
room quietly and says, “I’m not 
one to show a lot of sweetness or 
tenderness. Or pain … but inside I 
feel pain, remembering.”

Remembering what happened 

in the ’70s — and accepting it — 
was one of the most difficult chal-
lenges for the women in “No Más 
Bebés.” When Oscar-nominated 
director 
Renee 
Tajima-Peña 

(“Who Killed Vincent Chin?”) 
started what would become a 
six-year project, she had only a 
handful of aged court documents 
to locate the women — and even 
if she found them, many didn’t 
want to revisit such painful 
memories in an interview.

Some 
women, 
including 

Hurtado and four fellow plain-
tiffs in the case, did tell what 
happened in the hospital, the 
courtroom and amid the after-
math of the court ruling. Each 
shared a similar story: they 
were poor, young (in their early 
20s and 30s), married Latinas 
who had dreams of raising large 
families. In their culture, they 
explained, a woman’s role was to 
be a mother; if she couldn’t repro-
duce and raise children, she was 
“no longer a woman.”

As one woman heartbreak-

ingly said after her sterilization, 
“Now, my song is finished.”

Sadly, many women didn’t 

know they’d been sterilized until 
Antonia Hernandez, their law-
yer, showed them confidential 
hospital records of the steriliza-
tions, which she gathered from a 
brave medical resident who had 
carefully documented the acts. 

Realizing their condition, many 
of the women bore the knowl-
edge of their sterility alone, fear-
ing their husbands would leave 
them or they’d be shamed by 
their communities.

A question undercuts the film: 

why did it happen? Racism, elit-
ism and sexism all played a role 
in the horrific acts. In the ’70s, 
fear of overpopulation was ram-
pant in the U.S. — Paul Ehrlich’s 
“The Population Bomb,” which 
forecasted the end of humanity 
due to overcrowding, was a 1968 
bestseller — and the government 
began funding hospitals to con-
trol population growth.

America’s 
prime 
targets 

for population control? Poor, 
non-native or illiterate moth-
ers. Women who couldn’t read 
or understand what they were 
agreeing to: one woman, hear-
ing the word “sterilize,” thought 
the doctors were simply cleaning 
her reproductive system. Women 
who had babies already, who 
were told, “Don’t cry, it’s best for 
you not to have any more chil-
dren.”

Tajima-Peña 
told 
the 
Los 

Angeles Times that she only 
makes films when something 
makes her mad. “I thought that 
these mothers had a right to be 
heard,” she said in her interview. 
“No Más Bebés” represents the 
mothers beautifully, giving their 
voices center stage; there’s no 
narrating voiceover. Rather than 
clever recreations, the story is 
shot in present time, in the moth-
ers’ kitchens and living rooms.

Each scene echoes with some-

thing lost — an empty space 
where a child should be, a sad 
smile — but it reverberates 
with something else: the sheer 
strength of the women who won’t 
be silenced, not in the 1970s and 
not today.

That accent aigu is totally annoying, right?

SHAMROCKED

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Michigan 

rocketed toward its own ceiling 
Friday with the force of a team 
finally aware it could be special, 
only to hit its peak at halftime and 
crash forcefully back earthward.

The end result was a season-

ending thud: a 70-63 loss to 
Notre Dame in the first round 
of the NCAA Tournament. Just 
as painful as being sent home by 
a loss was the stark difference 
between the first and second half, 
which might as well have featured 
two different sets of Wolverines.

“We were playing great defense, 

we were able to get stops and we 
ended with a basket,” junior guard 
Zak Irvin said of the opening 
frame. “We were happy with 

how we were playing. We knew 
we didn’t want to have another 
sluggish start like we did against 
Tulsa. We were trying to avoid 
that.” 

Michigan scored the game’s 

first five points and built a 13-point 
advantage, riding an intensity it 
seemed to have saved for the bright 
lights of the Barclays Center. The 
biggest generators? Junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., whose four 
first-half steals left the Fighting 
Irish spinning, and freshman 
forward Moritz Wagner, who 
could do no wrong with the ball in 
his hands.

Twice, Wagner checked into 

the game, each time scoring within 
seconds. He capped the half with a 
steal and a finish on the other end 
that rolled around the cylinder 
twice before finally deciding to 

drop through. Wagner spun and 
led the Wolverines’ charge into the 
locker room, where, leading 41-29, 
they might have been tempted 
to contemplate the prospect of 
an improbable 
Sunday 
matchup 
with 
14-seed 

Stephen 
F. 

Austin 
for 
a 

berth 
in 
the 

Sweet 16.

The 

Wolverines 
couldn’t handle 
the 
pressure 

— 
mental 
or 

defensive — and 
everything they did right in the 
first half went disastrously wrong 
in the second.

“I think we’ve got to feel like 

some of our Big Ten partners 
today,” Beilein said. “You have 
everything, but you know, one 
game, if you have a bad game or 
you have a bad half, it’s over. It 

should 
sit 
in 

there, 
and 
it 

should 
upset 

you, 
and 
it 

should 
really 

motivate you as 
well.”

The 
bad 

that 
ended 

everything 
came 
from 

all 
angles. 

Sophomore 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
went 1-for-6 from the field in 
the second half after a 12-point 
outburst in the first frame, and 

Walton went scoreless. Junior 
forward Zak Irvin couldn’t help, 
either, finishing 4-for-16 from the 
field and a disastrous 1-for-9 from 
3-point range.

Most 
significantly, 
a 

controversial late-game charge 
call on what could have been an 
and-1 shifted the momentum 
forever in Notre Dame’s favor, 
as it marked Wagner’s fourth 
personal foul and forced him to 
ride the bench for 17 of the final 20 
minutes.

“It’s really not my call,” Wagner 

said of the whistle, which many 
thought should have been called 
a block. “I don’t need to judge 
that. I didn’t see it. I just thought 
to go up there. The shot clock was 
(winding down).”

In the locker room postgame, 

B

ROOKLYN, N.Y. — Before 
taking the court on Friday 
night, the Michigan men’s 

basketball 
team huddled 
inside a 
tunnel, tucked 
away from 
the fans at 
the Barclays 
Center.

They 

jumped 
around. Loose. 
Yelling in 
response as 
Zak Irvin shouted in the middle.

“It’s that time again,” Irvin 

barked.

“Ahhh,” they hollered back.

Irvin and the team went back 

and forth, him shouting, them 
answering.

I said it’s that time again.
Ahhh.
We on a big stage.
Ahhh.
Under the bright lights.
Ahhh.
Guess what we about to do?
Ahhh.
We about to put on a show.
And then, they ran from the 

tunnel, took the court, and for 20 
minutes, they did just that. They 
put on a show.

And it was a big stage.
In the matter of a week, the 

Wolverines willed themselves 
into the NCAA Tournament’s 

First Four in Dayton, Ohio and 
then gutted their way into a trip 
to Brooklyn and a meeting with 
No. 6 seed Notre Dame.

And you want bright lights? 

Try a 10:12 p.m. tip off on CBS 
with 17,502 packed in the crowd.

And for a half, none of it fazed 

them.

They shot the ball like a John 

Beilein-coached team is supposed 
to. Michigan went 16-for-31 from 
the field and knocked down seven 
3’s in the half.

They shared the ball like 

a cold in a kindergarten 
classroom. Their 12 first-half 
assists are the most they’ve had 
in a first frame since their last 
non-conference game against 

Bryant on Dec. 23.

And they defended the ball 

with an aggressiveness that’s 
been missing. The Wolverines 
produced 10 turnovers and seven 
steals to help secure a 12-point 
halftime lead.

But then the stage got bigger 

and the lights got brighter, and 
in the second half, Michigan 
didn’t put on a show. It was 
shown up.

Notre Dame came out of the 

gate with an 8-2 run and then, 
just like that, less than eight 
minutes into the second half, 
the Wolverines’ lead was gone. 
The Fighting Irish used sharp 
shooting and stingy defense to

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Experience bodes 
well for Michigan
T

ake a look, for a moment, 
at the composition of 
the starting lineups 

of the first 
eight teams 
to advance 
to the NCAA 
Tournament’s 
Sweet 16 on 
Saturday:

Miami 

— three 
seniors and 
two juniors; 
Indiana — 
two seniors, two juniors and 
one freshman; Gonzaga — three 
seniors, one sophomore and one 
freshman; Iowa State — three 
seniors and two juniors; North 
Carolina — two seniors, one junior 
and two sophomores; Virginia — 
two seniors, one junior and two 
sophomores; Kansas — one senior, 
three juniors and one sophomore; 
and Duke — one senior, one junior, 
one sophomore and two freshmen.

Notice a trend? Each of 

those starting lineups, with the 
exception of Duke’s, is composed 
primarily of upperclassmen.

Sometimes it’s easy to 

forget the impact that seniors 
and juniors have on college 
basketball. Programs like Duke 
and Kentucky, frequently 
fraught with star one-and-done 
freshmen, steal the headlines 
and seem to make deep runs year 
after year after year. Elite young 
talent can sway the balance of 
the NCAA Tournament and take 
teams deep into March Madness. 
But the most reliable way to 
survive the opening rounds of 
the NCAA Tournament typically 
requires a blend of experience 
and talent that is almost 
impossible for most programs to 
accumulate in just a year or two.

Michigan, for two years, had 

one of those rare runs in which 
young players carried the team 
deep into the tournament. In 
2013, the Wolverines started 
three freshmen, one sophomore 
and one junior in the national 
championship game against 
Louisville. One year later, 
Michigan started one freshman, 
three sophomores and one 
senior against Kentucky in the 
Elite Eight.

But Trey Burke, Nik Stauskas, 

Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson 
and Tim Hardaway Jr. were 
exceptional talents who left 
Michigan early to play in the 
NBA. Senior guard Caris LeVert, 
a key player on the Elite Eight 
team, will join them in the 
professional ranks next season.

Some Michigan fans have 

derided John Beilein for his 
apparent inability to replace 
those guys with equally talented 
players who could keep the run 
going. But at the end of this 
season, one thing became clear: 
His perceived failure will leave 
the Wolverines with a bevy of 
savvy veterans next season.

Take Derrick Walton Jr. He 

came to Ann Arbor as a highly 
touted recruit before the 2013-14 
season, but one who didn’t have 
to be a focal point right away 
because of the talent Michigan 

had during his freshman season. 
Slowly but surely, his per-game 
averages in scoring, rebounding, 
assists and steals have increased 
in each of the junior guard’s first 
three seasons.

He’s not a bona fide star, but 

going into his senior year he 
has experienced nearly every 
type of season possible. He 
started during a deep NCAA 
Tournament run during his 
freshman year, suffered through 
a disastrous season during his 
sophomore year and helped lead 
this year’s season-saving run to 
reach NCAA Tournament. He 
had six (!) steals in Michigan’s 
loss to Notre Dame on Friday, 
and there’s little doubt that the 
varied experiences of his career 
will help him lead this team next 
year during his senior season.

Zak Irvin has experienced 

a similar career arc. He has 
weathered more personal 
up-and-downs on the court than 
Walton, but he has been through 
the same range of experiences 
in terms of the Wolverines’ team 
success.

At times, Irvin’s shot 

selection is frustrating. But as 
he demonstrated time and time 
again during the final weeks 
of the season, he isn’t afraid of 
taking the big shot, even when 
he’s been way off the rest of the 
game. That kind of resiliency is 
why teams with older players 
thrive in March, and it’s part 
of the reason next season looks 
bright for Michigan.

If Beilein starts the same 

players next year that he started 
against the Fighting Irish, he 
will have two seniors in Walton 
and Irvin, a redshirt junior 
in Duncan Robinson, a junior 
in Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman and either a redshirt 
junior or a senior in Mark Donnal 
— depending on whether Beilein 
decides to give him his fifth year 
back — in his starting lineup.

Even if Moritz Wagner, who 

will be a sophomore next season, 
replaces Donnal as a starter, the 
makeup of the potential starting 
lineup looks awfully similar to 
that of the first eight teams to 
make the Sweet 16 this season. 

It’s no guarantee, as evidenced 

by the injury woes of the past two 
years, that the Wolverines will be 
a great team next season or that 
they will be able to replicate the 
NCAA Tournament runs of 2013 
and 2014, but the last two weeks 
showed that this year’s iteration 
of the Michigan men’s basketball 
team could compete at a high 
level in do-or-die situations.

The players who made the 

key shots against Northwestern, 
Indiana and Tulsa will all return, 
barring unexpected changes, and 
if the Wolverines return to the 
NCAA Tournament next season, 
their lineup will be chock-full of 
veterans. And if the early portion 
of this year’s tournament is any 
indication, that will only help 
their cause.

Derrick Walton Jr. could be one of three senior starters for Michigan next year.

storm back and tie the game. 
The two teams traded blows 
down the stretch with the lead 
changing five times.

And when the lights were 

brightest, with less than four 
minutes and the game knotted, 
Notre Dame forward V.J. 
Beachem hit a 3-pointer. Irvin 
missed his try from deep on the 
other end. The Irish closed out 
in the home stretch. Michigan 
went home.

As Notre Dame hit free 

throws late to ice the game, 
Irvin stood at midcourt, hands 
on hips. Stunned.

In the locker room after the 

game, Derrick Walton Jr. wiped 
away tears from a usually stone-
cold face. Duncan Robinson 
sat with his arm over Moritz 
Wagner. Wagner sat doubled 
over, his jersey hiding his face. 
Andrew 
Dakich was 
perched back 
in his locker, 
away from it 
all.

They were 

trying to 
figure out how 
they blew a 
12-point lead. 
What went 
wrong in the 
second half, why they would 
head back to Ann Arbor on 
Saturday instead of prep for a 
second-round game.

But they also wondered what 

they could’ve been if that team 
that showed up in the first half 
— the one that put on a show — 
had showed itself earlier in the 
season.

“We’ll never know how 

special this group could have 
been,” Walton said. “In my 
mind it could have been one of 
the best.”

One of the best?
Yeah, for 20 minutes it looked 

the part of a team that could 
gut out wins and make a run in 
March.

Wagner was throwing down 

dunks and beating his chest 
like a kid who’s played in the 
tournament before — not one 
who watched from his couch 
in Berlin last year. Walton 
showed flashes of looking like 

another guard Michigan had 
a few years ago. Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman showed 
flashes of looking like Walton 
— capable of scoring, capable of 
leading.

It didn’t look like that 

Michigan team that couldn’t hit 
shots from any range against 
Connecticut in the Bahamas. Or 
the team that came out dead flat 
against Michigan State earlier 
this season and got walloped 
in front of its home fans. Or the 
one that couldn’t close on the 
road late against Maryland.

It looked like the team people 

thought it would be with Caris 
LeVert heading things up — 
even as LeVert watched from 
the bench. Walton and Irvin 
provided the leadership on the 
court, and, for the first time 
in a long time, for a whole half 
everything clicked.

“We were loose and 

confident,” Dakich said. “We 
played with that no-fear 

mentality. It 
was fun to be 
a part of, and 
fun to watch 
on the bench 
and fun to 
play with.”

Perhaps it 

was a fitting 
end for a team 
that struggled 
to have 
everything 

click on the same night during 
the regular season. It showed 
what they were capable of. 
What they could have been.

“You know you can always 

have those ‘what ifs,’ especially 
at the end of your season,” 
Irvin said. “But I just think that 
shows the strides we were able 
to make from the beginning of 
the season.”

Walton thought those 20 

minutes validated their year.

“We can play with the best 

of them and showed it,” Walton 
said.

For 20 minutes they showed 

it.

On the big stage, under the 

bright lights, they put on a 
show.

But now, the lights are out, 

and the show is over.

streaks of optimism punctuated 
the gloomy and sometimes teary 
vibe. Some said the 41-point first 
half may have just been a preview 
of next year’s team, which will 
return every active player from 
the 2015-16 squad.

Senior guards Spike Albrecht 

and Caris LeVert effectively 
ended their seasons in December, 
leaving Big Ten season to the next 
generation a few months earlier 

than anticipated. Without its two 
leaders, the team’s expectations 
were adjusted, perhaps lessening 
the force of a blow still too 
fresh for the Wolverines to fully 
process.

“We had to go through a lot 

of adversity, losing our two 
seniors, our two captains,” 
Irvin said. “People didn’t even 
think we were going to make 
the NCAA Tournament, so 
for us to be able to do that, 
(the season) definitely ended 
pretty strong. It’s just tough to 
swallow this loss.”

‘M’ makes strides for next year

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

When looking at the season 

in 
retrospect, 
it’s 
easy 
to 

see how the year was made 
for the Michigan basketball 
team’s growth. After battling 
departures 
from 
senior 

captains 
Caris 
LeVert 
and 

Spike Albrecht, it was difficult 
to expect the same preseason 
top-25 
expectations 
as 
the 

Wolverines 
learned 
to 
play 

without their two leaders. 

But though LeVert was lost 

to 
injury, 
sophomore 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman proved to be a steady 
replacement, 
clocking 
in 
15 

points per game this postseason. 
Freshman 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner figured out how to help 
his team again, emerging in 
the Big Ten Tournament as the 
spark the Wolverines needed. 
Junior forward Zak Irvin hit 
two game-winning shots, one to 
put Michigan past Northwestern 
in the Big Ten Tournament and 
another to get past Tulsa during 
the First Four. 

Friday night’s first round 

loss to Notre Dame hurt, but for 
Michigan, the hurt will continue 
in the offseason and remind the 
Wolverines what the Big Dance 
means. All of the active members 
of the roster will be returning 
next season — barring a player’s 
departure — and being through 
the tournament once before will 
pay dividends.

“One 
hundred 
percent, 

regardless of on the bench or the 
court, I’ve learned so much this 
year,” Wagner said. “Just the 
coaches, the players — a lot of 
the players — just to compete in 
practice is just an unbelievable 
push, unbelievable opportunity 
to improve every day.”

Added 
junior 
forward 

Mark 
Donnal: 
“We’re 
really 

close to being a special team. 
Unfortunately, we came short of 
our expectations this year, but I 
think this serves as motivation for 

next year to work even harder.”

Jon 
Sanderson, 
Michigan’s 

strength and conditioning coach, 
is known for transforming players 
over the summer. Donnal thinks 
that most of the Wolverines plan 
on spending the summer in the 
weight room, providing ample 
time to improve.

Redshirt sophomore Duncan 

Robinson 
agrees 
with 
that 

sentiment.

“I’m far from satisfied in that 

regard — I’m far from a finished 
product,” Robinson said. “I look 
forward to putting a lot of work 
in this offseason and getting a 
lot better.”

Wagner is unsure of where 

he’ll spend his summer, but 
when asked if he’ll be returning 
to Michigan for his sophomore 
season, he answered right away: 
“One hundred percent, yeah. No 
doubt.”

It’s difficult to make the 

argument 
that 
a 
player’s 

physical ability is less important 
than the relationships between 
the athletes off the court, but 

many Wolverines noted the 
considerable improvement in 
rapport due to the tumultuous 
final weeks of the season. 

On the subject of developments 

made over the course of the 
season, a similar response echoed 
from multiple players.

“I definitely think (the last 

two weeks) brought us together,” 
said redshirt sophomore Duncan 
Robinson. “It showed that we’re 
capable of winning tough games 
against good teams, we just 
gotta be better defensively, we 
definitely learned that, and we 
will be next year.”

Junior 
guard 
Andrew 

Dakich, who initially planned 
on 
redshirting 
this 
season 

but jumped in when Albrecht 
announced his retirement, is 
known for his leadership and 
intensity during practice.

One of his big takeaways from 

the season is that the team grew 
both physically and mentally.

“Just kinda building off this 

year in a sense of, not necessarily 
on-the-court, but off-the-court 

relationships, 
have 
grown 

tremendously,” Dakich said. “I 
think that’s the kind of bond, to 
have that, and progressing on 
the court as well, (next season) 
could be something special.”

The 
2015-16 
Michigan 

basketball season has come to a 
close, but the Wolverines are far 
from done ruminating about its 
bittersweet ending. 

“It’s awesome,” Wagner said of 

the NCAA Tournament. “At the 
end of the day, it’s just basketball, 
but it is just a stage thing. It’s a 
huge stage. You kinda feel that 
around you, the environment is 
impressive, but at the end of the 
day, it’s playing basketball.”

Added 
Dakich: 
“Just 
to 

see how close we can be to 
something special kinda speaks 
for itself, in a sense.”

Fifty-one weeks from now, the 

Wolverines will still be thinking 
about 
the 
2016 
tournament 

while awaiting their 2017 fate. 
Every starter will know how it 
feels to lose, and that experience 
will only help them.

WOMEN’S TENNIS
‘M’ holds off MSU

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
The 

Michigan women’s tennis team 
(1-0 Big Ten, 8-4 overall) had 
more 
to 

compete 
with 
Saturday 
than just rival Michigan State¬¬ 
— it also had to battle a hostile 
road crowd that even cheered 
at 
the 
Wolverines’ 
errors. 

Michigan ended up fighting off 
both in a 5-2 win.

“We’re on the road — we don’t 

expect them to be cheering for 
us,” said Michigan coach Ronni 
Berstein. “The crowd was tough 
on us, and I think we showed 
some toughness to get through 
here today.”

Bernstein’s task of putting 

out a lineup was made tougher 
with freshman Kate Fahey still 
sidelined by a minor injury.

Bernstein 
thought 
she 

found the answer in senior 
Ronit Yurovsky and freshman 
Brienne Minor, who led the 
lineup as the No. 1 doubles team, 
but their connection seemed 
to be lacking as the Spartans 
dominated the matchup.

Michigan State controlled the 

match, and both Yurovsky and 
Minor showed frustration. The 
duo eventually lost, 6-3.

Sophomores 
Alex 
Najarian 

and Mira Ruder-Hook, the No. 2 
doubles team, were able to level 
the playing field by defeating 
Michigan State, 6-3. Both sides 
began the match trading games, 

but quick hands at the net and 
high intensity made the difference 
for Najarian and Ruder-Hook.

The winner of the No. 3 

doubles match would clinch the 
doubles point and give either 
team an advantage going into 
singles play. Freshman Teona 
Velehorschi and junior Sara 
Remynse were more than ready 
for the challenge.

Michigan 
was 
up, 
5-4, 

and serving for the match. 
Velehorschi produced a big serve 
that allowed Remynse to poach 
at the net and end the match, 6-4.

In singles play, if Yurovsky 

and Minor were affected by 
their doubles loss, they definitely 
didn’t show it. Yurovsky came 
out firing on all cylinders, 
jumping out to a 5-0 lead in the 
first set. Her power from the 
baseline couldn’t be matched by 
Spartan Erin Faulkner, allowing 
Yurovsky to finish her match first 
with a score of 6-1, 6-1.

“You have to come into singles 

with a totally different mindset,” 
Bernstein said, “you’ve got to 
let that doubles go whether it’s 
good or bad.”

Though Minor had to work 

a little harder for her win than 
Yurovsky, she stayed dominant 
for the duration of her match. 
After taking the first set, 6-3, 
Minor jumped out to a quick lead 
in the second and rolled to a win.

The Wolverines look forward 

to continuing conference play 
in front of their own rowdy 
home crowd in the following 
weeks with the next matchup 
against Indiana.

Wolverines advance in WNIT

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

It is generally safe to assume 

Katelynn Flaherty will be the 
leading scorer for the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team in any 
given game. 
When the ball releases from her 
right hand, most of the crowd 
and everyone on the floor believes 
it’s going in. But in the second 
round of the Women’s National 
Invitational 
Tournament, 

Flaherty struggled to find the 
bottom of the net.

On 
Saturday, 
though, 

Michigan didn’t need her to. The 
rest of the Wolverines picked up 
the load en route to a 95-72 win 
over Bucknell to advance further 
in the WNIT.

“I’m just trying to keep this 

season going as long as I can,” said 
senior guard Madison Ristovski.

Freshman center Hallie Thome 

was the focus of Michigan’s 
offense early on. Thome scored 
seven points within the first 
five minutes of the game as the 
two Bucknell players who were 
defending 
her 
combined 
to 

earn three fouls. Junior guard 
Danielle 
Williams 
drew 
two 

and-1s on circus-shot baskets 
during Thome’s run, helping the 
Wolverines maintain their early 
lead. Along with two 3-pointers 
by junior guard Siera Thompson, 
Michigan led at the end of the first 
quarter, 29-24.

The second quarter continued 

as a back and forth affair, as the 
Wolverines were unable to build 
upon their lead. Both teams were 
shooting 57 percent from the 
floor with four minutes left in the 
quarter. With Michigan (19-13) 
leading by only one, coach Kim 
Barnes Arico called a timeout, and 
the Wolverines came out firing 
as Thompson drilled another 
attempt from behind the arc. The 
Bison (25-8) went on a run to earn 
a lead, but it lasted for less than 
one minute, as the Wolverines 

took charge again, taking a 44-42 
lead into halftime.

“I thought that eventually, 

with our depth, we could wear 
them down and really try to push 
in transition and try to score,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They did a 
really great job scoring with us 
early on, and I think as the game 
continued, we were able to wear 
them down.”

Sophomore guard Katelynn 

Flaherty became the first player 
in program history to score more 
than 700 points in a season with 
her first basket of the game, but 
her first basket was her only made 
attempt of the half. Flaherty shot 
1-for-5 in the first 20 minutes, well 
off pace of her 22.5 point per game 
average.

Flaherty’s first shot attempt 

in the third quarter rimmed out 
as well, but her next attempt 
went through the nylon, giving 
Michigan an eight point lead. 

Shortly after, Thome went on 
another 
hot 
streak, 
tallying 

six straight points to put the 
Wolverines ahead by nine.

“When (Thome) got back in 

and we made our run in the fourth 
quarter, we were able to get her 
touches on the ball,” Barnes Arico 
said. “When she was able to get 
touches, things started to open 
up for everyone else. When she 
wasn’t in the game, people could 
really key on Katelynn.”

At one point in the game, 

Flaherty missed four straight 
shots, 
including 
an 
airballed 

three, but she finally scored on 
her fifth attempt to bring her to 
3-of-12 shooting. Ristovski picked 
up the load in the third quarter, 
and her six points came at crucial 
times with the shot clock winding 
down. With Ristovski’s help, 
Michigan was up, 62-58, going 
into the fourth quarter.

Flaherty started the fourth 

quarter off with a 3-pointer, 
possibly lifting her and the rest of 
her team’s confidence to increase 
its slim lead. Flaherty’s next 
behind-the-arc dagger pushed the 
Wolverine lead to double digits 
with just over six minutes left in 
regulation.

Michigan didn’t let up from 

there, not allowing the Bison to 
come back in the game any closer. 
The Wolverines left the floor with 
the crowd on its feet, riding high 
on confidence to advance to the 
next round knowing that if even 
Flaherty has an off day, the rest of 
the team is more than capable of 
scoring in her absence.

“Today, we really executed 

down the stretch, we got the ball 
in the right people’s hands to take 
the right shots down the stretch,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Then we got 
key stops when we needed to get 
stops. We took steps in the right 
direction today.”

Michigan 10th 
at NCAA meet

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Since Michigan men’s and 

women’s swimming and diving 
coach Mike Bottom took over 
the women’s coaching duties 
in 2013, the team has been 
progressing — slowly but surely.

This year, the team made its 

biggest jump yet.

Competing at the NCAA 

Championships in Atlanta this 
past weekend, the Wolverines 
finished 10th overall — their 
best finish since 2008. Last 
season, the team finished 22nd 
in the nation.

“I am very pleased,” Bottom 

said. “Moving up 12 places is 
pretty impressive. I don’t think 
there is any other school that 
moved up as much as we did. 
Twelve places was quite a jump 
for a young team.”

The 12-spot jump follows 

a 
trend 
under 
Bottom 
of 

steady improvement. In 2014, 
Michigan finished 30th in the 
nation, and in 2013 — when 
the men’s team won a national 
championship with Bottom at 
the helm — the women’s team 
finished 36th.

Senior Ali DeLoof had a 

standout meet, setting a new 
Big Ten record in the 100-yard 
freestyle with a time of 47.54. 
She finished fifth in the event 
and 
received 
All-American 

honors in both that event and 
the 50-yard freestyle.

DeLoof also finished in the 

top 10 in the 400-yard freestyle 
relay. The relay — consisting of 
DeLoof, her sister sophomore 
Gabby 
DeLoof, 
freshman 

Siobhán Haughey and freshman 
Becca Postoll — placed ninth 
with a time of 3:12.98, which 
also set a school record.

In order for the team to 

finish in the top 10, the relay 
had to finish at least fifth in the 
second heat. Not only did the 
relay finish fifth in the heat, but 
it ended up winning it. Though 
the relay didn’t qualify for the 
finals, its performance was 
good enough to cement a top-10 
finish for Wolverines.

“It was really an impressive 

relay,” Bottom said.

Arguably the best event on 

the day for Michigan was the 
1,650-yard freestyle. Freshman 
Yirong Bi set a school record 
with a time of 15:45.26 — a 
third-place 
finish 
— 
while 

sophomore Gillian Ryan came 
in ninth with a time of 16:01.45.

The meet comes four weeks 

after the Wolverines won their 
first Big Ten Championship in 
12 years — another sign of the 
Mike Bottom resurgence.

“That 
was 
an 
emotional 

meet,” Bottom said. “Coming 
off of that and then coming 
here, it was a second boil for us. 
I think that the women really 
handled it well. In almost every 
case, they swam faster than 
they did at Big Tens. It was 
pretty exciting to watch the 
team respond to that.”

Even 
more 
impressive 

is that while preparing the 
women’s team for the NCAA 
Championships, Bottom was 
also coaching the men’s team 
to a sixth consecutive Big Ten 
Championship.

“I have such a great staff,” 

Bottom said. “Rick Bishop is 
the associate head coach on 
the women’s side and does an 
incredible job of planning and 
scheduling. 
These 
coaches 

really are an amazing staff, the 
best staff in the country. It’s a 
team performance all-around, 
whether for the coaching staff 
or for swimming and diving.”

Michigan rallies for top-10 finish

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan wrestling team 

was in need of a late-tournament 
rally to finish in the top 10 at 
the NCAA Championships this 
weekend.

The 
Wolverines 
weren’t 

led by the usual workhorses 
at the higher weight classes. 
Instead, 
junior 
125-pounder 

Conor Youtsey and sophomore 
149-pounder 
Alec 
Pantaleo 

fueled the team’s rally along 
with junior heavyweight Adam 
Coon. 

Youtsey, in particular, had 

to scramble to earn his fifth-
place finish. He lost in the 
quarterfinals early on Friday, 
and 
was 
relegated 
to 
the 

wrestleback 
portion 
of 
the 

tournament. 
The 
unseeded 

junior went on to take down 
No. 8 Barlow McGhee from 
Missouri, 5-3, on a single-leg 
takedown 
with 
one 
second 

remaining in the match.

The win placed Youtsey in 

the “blood round,” a consolation 
round where the winner is 
named All-American and the 
loser is eliminated. The “blood 
round” match finished in a 
3-3 tie, but Youtsey was given 
the victory because of his six-
second advantage in riding 
time. For the second year in 
a row, Youtsey came into the 
tournament unseeded and left 
an All-American.

“It was fun to watch (Youtsey) 

compete,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “His intensity, 
desire and focus was where 
it needed to be. It was very 
impressive.”

Coon’s road to his third-

place 
finish 
was 
more 

straightforward. The reliable 
junior won all of his matches 
before losing in the semifinals. 
The fifth-ranked Coon then 
defeated No. 8 Amarveer Dhesi 
from Oregon State in just 47 
seconds, 
earning 
another 

victory via pinfall in the third-
place match.

Though 
the 
NCAA 

Championships are the team’s 
final event of the season, Coon 
still has the Olympic Trials to 

look forward to.

“I’ve 
got 
a 
pretty 
quick 

turnaround,” Coon said. “I’ll take 
a couple days off to let my body 
recover. Maybe after the trials, 
I’ll take a little more time to 
review on how the season went, 
but I’ve got to put this season 
behind me pretty (quickly).”

Pantaleo earned a spot on the 

podium for himself by pinning 
his opponent in the consolation 
round, but fell in the fifth-place 
match via pinfall to finish sixth 
in the 149-pound division.

Though the season is over for 

the team, McFarland and his 
staff won’t be taking a break 
any time soon. Preparations and 
training for next season have 
already begun.

“We’re 
starting 
to 
have 

some conversations amongst 
the coaching staff on things 
in 
regards 
to 
next 
year,” 

McFarland 
said. 
“But 
we’ll 

probably get going this weekend 
on a number of things, and just 
continue to move forward.”

Though 
some 
of 
the 

members of the team aren’t 
finished wrestling, once again 
the Wolverines’ season ends 
without them meeting their high 
expectations. After spending 
much of the year highly ranked 
in the polls, Michigan was 
unable to overcome some of 
the top-tier teams in their 
conference and beyond. 

And when the Wolverines 

needed some of their most 
consistent competitiors to step 
up the most, they were unable 
to score to help the team. The 
lone seniors that competed at 
the 
NCAA 
Championships, 

197-pounder Max Huntley and 
133-pounder Rossi Bruno, both 
earned All-American status last 
year, but were unable to repeat 
this year.

“I feel bad for those guys,” 

McFarland said. “It was tough 
for 
Max. 
Max 
has 
really 

struggled with a bad back. It 
was bothering him since the 
Big 
Ten 
Championships. 
It 

was so bad, that he was really 
struggling with it throughout 

the tournament. It really locked 
up on him. But I was really 
proud of the way he went out 
there and competed. He’s been 
a great leader in our program, 
and he’s done a tremendous job 
this year as one of our captains.” 

Even though the seniors’ 

careers ended unceremoniously 
this weekend, their contributions 
over their careers have been felt 
by those who will remain in the 
program after this year. 

“They’re 
just 
top-notch 

guys,” said Coon. “They just 
welcomed us in to the team (as 
freshmen), and now they’re the 
leaders of the team. It just goes 
to show how quickly the season 
goes, and how quickly your 
whole college career goes.”

And now, with a roster that 

is returning almost all of its 
members and a coaching staff 
firmly focused on the future, 
Michigan will look to take 
advantage of the lessons from 
its 
seniors 
and 
ultimately 

improve on the results from this 
season.

‘M’ splits weekend

By ROBERT HEFTER 

For the Daily

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse team faced off against 
Duquesne on Sunday in an attempt 
to avenge its 15-5 loss to No. 20 
Massachusetts on Friday. Due to 
the Wolverines’ first-half offensive 
drought Friday, the Minutewomen 
were able to take a commanding 
lead with some first-half heroics. 
The loss was in stark contrast 
to Sunday’s game, when the 
Wolverines sparked their offense 
in the second half, resulting in a 
9-4 win against the Dukes.

In 
their 
first 
outdoor 

home game of the season, the 
Wolverines fell victim to sluggish 
play, and UMass capitalized. 
In the first five minutes of the 
match, the Minutewomen scored 
two goals to give them an early 
2-0 lead. However, Michigan 
bounced back with a goal just two 
minutes later. 

Fierce play and strong defense 

led to a 13-minute period without 
goals, until UMass buried three 
goals to increase its lead to 6-1. 
A late score by the Wolverines 
would send them to halftime with 
a four-goal deficit.

After two early scores by the 

Minutewomen in the second half, 
Michigan pulled within five with 
three straight goals. However, as 
the Wolverines began to crack 
late in the second half, UMass 
scored five more times in a span 
of six minutes.

Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 

Ulehla stressed the need to 
respond in its following game 
against Duquesne. 

“We 
seriously 
needed 
to 

regroup,” Ulehla said. “We had a 
lot of fundamental issues.”

The Wolverines did just that, as 

they came out against Duquesne 
firing on all cylinders at the first 
whistle. Michigan maintained 
most of the possession at the 
onset, and two minutes in, junior 
attacker Tess Korten drove the 
ball toward the crease to put in an 
unassisted goal. 

Less than 40 seconds later, 

junior 
attacker 
Angerman 

delivered a pristine pass to 
junior attack/midfielder Lauren 

Oberlander, who slipped the ball 
past the Dukes’ goalie with ease. 
Junior attacker Kelly Schlansker 
would put in another goal a mere 
minute later.

“I think we were a little 

inconsistent,” Angerman said. 
“There were definitely some five-
minute spurts when we played 
really well, and then some times 
when we were a little sloppy.”

Korten credits the offensive 

dominance to the defense for 
creating crucial turnovers, which 
would allow for easier transitions 
to goals for the Wolverines.

“In the second half, we really 

were communicating, and we 
have so many offensive threats 
that we don’t have to rely only on 
specific people,” said Angerman.

Due to two Michigan penalties 

committed 
in 
the 
midfield, 

Duquesne was able to find the 
net with 25 minutes remaining, 
which launched the Dukes on a 
4-0 run that gave them a 4-3 lead 
going into halftime. 

“We came out and played 

incredibly well in the beginning 
and then there was a plateau,” 
Ulehla said. “We wanted a high-
pressure ride, and that was 
successful as well as possessing 
the ball offensively.”

Michigan 
immediately 

followed up on that high pressure, 
as 
Angerman 
dangled 
the 

Duquesne goalie to find the back 
of the net 49 seconds into the half. 
Goals by Korten, Oberlander, 
junior midfielder Anna Schueler 
and 
junior 
attacker 
Allie 

Breitfeller would follow to give 
Michigan an 8-4 lead. A total of 
seven attackers scored on the day, 
giving new life to the Wolverine 
offense days after being shut 
down by UMass.

“We went into the locker 

room knowing we would have to 
come out more competitive and 
aggressive,” Korten said. “We 
really turned the game around to 
our control.”

Michigan looks to bring this 

strong defense and high-octane 
offense to Colorado in a week. 

“It’s nice having a full week 

going into our Colorado match,” 
Angerman said. “It’s always a 
pretty big game for us.”

BACK TO THE TOURNAMENT

Michigan rallies 
past Minnesota to 
win first Big Ten 
Tournament title

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Three 

hundred sixty-one days ago, the 
Michigan hockey team found 
itself in a 
situation 
eerily 
similar to that of Saturday 
night — taking the ice for the 
Big Ten Championship against 
Minnesota.

At the time, as the Wolverines 

entered the championship game 
at Joe Louis Arena, they were 
on the wrong side of the NCAA 
Tournament bubble, in dire need 
of an upset against the Golden 
Gophers to keep their season 
alive. But when the final horn 
sounded, 
Michigan 
was 
left 

with a scoreboard reading 4-2 in 
Minnesota’s favor to cement its 
campaign.

In the 361 days that followed, 

though, 
that 
dynamic 
had 

changed drastically.

This time, the Wolverines 

had the cards in their hands 
entering 
the 
championship 

game — having already solidified 
a NCAA Tournament berth with 
only retribution to truly play 
for. And now, Minnesota was 
the team in need of a season-
preserving victory.

And Michigan was able to 

change the most important part 
of the former narrative, capturing 
the Big Ten Championship with 
a 5-3 victory against the Golden 
Gophers at Xcel Energy Center.

“Up until tonight there’s been 

five banners hung and we have 
four of them,” said Minnesota 
coach Don Lucia. “We were 
trying to get a fifth, and Michigan 
didn’t have one — and that’s 
a proud program. … That can 

sometimes be the driving force.”

After 
three 
unanswered 

Minnesota goals left Michigan 
in a 3-2 hole entering the third 
period, 
freshman 
forward 

Kyle Connor and sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

rose to the occasion during 
crunch time.

A few short minutes into 

the final frame, the freshman 
brought the Wolverines back to 
life with an equalizer.

Connor received a cross-ice 

pass from junior forward JT 
Compher, and was alone against 
Schierhorn. He hesitated and 
baited Schierhorn to come out 
of the net before faking one shot 
and deking right to leave both the 
Gophers’ goaltender on his back 
and the puck in the net.

Twelve minutes later, with 

Michigan on the power play, 
Werenski gave his team the 
Big Ten Championship. The 
Wolverines rotated the puck 
around 
the 
offensive 
zone, 

tallying a number of shots, 
before it ended up at the point on 
Werenski’s stick.

The blueliner let one loose, and 

the goal horn lit up. Michigan 4, 
Minnesota 3.

“In between the second and 

third, (last year is) something we 
talked about, is ‘We owe them,’ ” 
Werenski said. “They ended our 
season last year, so we came out 
with some fire.”

Michigan closed out the game 

with a stout defensive effort, led 
by senior goaltender Steve Racine 
— who slammed the door shut 
against Minnesota’s last-ditch 
efforts — before notching an 
open-net goal to seal the victory.

Neither side could break the 

stalemate during the opening 10 
minutes of the rematch, partly 
because No. 20 Minnesota (14-7 
Big Ten, 20-17 overall) opened the 
game with a conservative approach 
— sending its defensemen back to 
the red line every time Michigan 
started a breakout.

Eventually, 
though, 
the 

seventh-ranked Wolverines (13-

5-3-2 Big Ten, 24-7-5 overall) 
found a breakthrough on the first 
power play of the game.

Just over 10 minutes into 

the 
frame, 
Werenski 
was 

quarterbacking the power play 
from the point. He sent a pass to 
Connor in the right circle, who 
patiently cradled the puck with 
a Minnesota defenseman in front 
of him, searching for a chink in 
the defense’s armor.

Then he found it.
Connor served junior forward 

Tyler Motte in front, leaving him 
with only Minnesota goaltender 
Eric Schierhorn to beat. Motte 
was up to the task, as he lifted the 
puck in the air to beat Schierhorn 
glove side.

The finish gave Michigan a 

1-0 lead, marked Motte’s 30th 
goal of the season and continued 
Connor’s 25-game point streak.

When the Wolverines added 

another goal, it appeared that 
they were on their way to a 
storybook ending. But the first 
few chapters were torn out 
quickly as they had been written.

In the span of four minutes, 

Minnesota responded with two 
goals of its own to even the score. 
The equalizer sucked the life 
out of the Wolverines, instantly 
turning them on the defensive. 
Michigan managed to weather 
that storm for a little over six 
minutes, but eventually conceded 
a power play that proved to be the 
breaking point.

“We started playing slower,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “I thought we started 
playing cuter. We weren’t as 
physical. … We were on the wrong 
side of the puck, and sure enough 
they got back in the game.”

Behind Connor and Werenski’s 

goals, in addition to Motte’s open-
net finish in the closing minute, 
none of that mattered. Michigan 
changed the most important part 
of the former narrative. It has a 
banner to hang at Yost Ice Arena.

And more than anything, it 

exorcised its demons that have 
been following them all season.

Wolverines will 
open Midwest 
Regional play vs. 

Notre Dame

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team is 

back where it was for 22 straight 
seasons prior to the 2012-13 
season: the NCAA Tournament.

Friday night, the Wolverines, 

a No. 2 seed in the Midwest 
Regional, will take on No. 3 seed 
Notre Dame, while No. 1 seed 
North Dakota and No. 4 seed 
Northeastern 
round 
out 
the 

regional in Cincinnati.

The selection comes a day 

after Michigan captured the Big 
Ten Tournament title, defeating 
Minnesota, 5-3, in St. Paul, Minn.

“Coach said Cincinnati has 

been good to Michigan,” said 
junior forward Tyler Motte, “so 
we have to be good to Cincinnati.”

Just the three seniors on the 

current roster have ever played 
against the Fighting Irish. Senior 
goaltender Steve Racine recalled 
a conversation from just after the 
selection show, when he talked 
with fellow senior Justin Selman 
about 
how 
the 
Wolverines 

haven’t defeated Notre Dame 
during their careers.

Michigan 
will 
enter 
the 

tournament with the nation’s best 
offense, tallying 4.89 goals per 
game, with the next closest team 
putting up 4.28 goals a game.

The Wolverines also boast the 

nation’s most prolific forward 
line — the CCM line — consisting 
of freshman Kyle Connor and 
juniors JT Compher and Motte. 
The trio ranks first, second and 
third in the nation in points, 
respectively. Connor leads the 
country in points with 69, while 
Compher and Motte hold 60 and 
54, respectively.

But Berenson doesn’t think 

Notre Dame will be fazed.

“(Notre 
Dame 
coach 
Jeff 

Jackson) 
is 
an 
experienced 

coach,” Berenson said. “He has 
played against Michigan teams 
before, and Michigan teams that 
have had offensive histories and 
they’ll figure it out. They’re a team 
that will come at you and play 
their game.”

Notre Dame, meanwhile, is led 

by goaltender Cal Petersen, who 

boasts a .928 save percentage and 
2.19 goals-against average.

Michigan and Notre Dame 

haven’t played since the formation 
of the Big Ten Hockey Conference 
in 2013-14.

“Notre Dame is one of our old, I 

wouldn’t say rivals, but borderline 
rival,” Berenson said. “(Notre 
Dame coach) Jeff Jackson is as good 
of a coach there is in college hockey 
and his teams show that every 
year. 
They’re 

disciplined, 
hard-working, 
well-coached 
and 
I 
think 

you’ll see a close 
hockey game.”

When 

they 
last 

met, 
though, 

the 
stakes 

were 
high. 

The old-time rivals were pitted 
in 
the 
CCHA 
Tournament 

Championship. If Michigan had 
won, it would have moved onto 
the NCAA Tournament. Instead, 
Notre Dame took the title and 
ended the Wolverines’ season.

Michigan’s goaltender in that 

game was then-freshman Steve 
Racine, who wasn’t the team’s 
starter the majority of that season.

He 
hasn’t 
forgotten 
that 

moment.

“I just remember that they 

were really strong and physical 
and we had problems with that, 
and they kind of took it to us a 
little bit,” Racine said. “But we 
haven’t seen them in a couple of 
years, so I couldn’t tell you much 
about them yet. But we’ll be ready.

“Just 
like 
Minnesota 
beat 

us last year in the Big Ten 

Championship, 
Notre 
Dame, 

my 
freshman 

year, ended the 
streak. Getting 
back at them 
would be nice.”

Racine 

added 
that 

Notre 
Dame, 

like Penn State 
and Minnesota 

who have ended the Wolverines’ 
seasons that past two seasons, 
respectively, is another team that 
Michigan “owes” — all because 
of 
that 
CCHA 
Tournament 

Championship.

So 1,096 days after that crushing 

defeat, Racine and Michigan will 
have a chance at revenge.

And this time it’ll be in the 

tournament that matters most.
