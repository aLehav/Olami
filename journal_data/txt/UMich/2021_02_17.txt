University of Michigan President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
the 

University is taking several steps 
to increase its testing capabilities 
during his weekly U-M Ann Arbor 
COVID-19 update email to the U-M 
community Feb. 5. 

Starting Feb. 16, the University 

will require weekly COVID-19 
testing for graduate and professional 
program students living on campus. 
The University will also offer free 
testing to “Ann Arbor community 
members residing near the U-M Ann 
Arbor campus” through the end of 
the month and pop-up testing to 
students in quarantine housing. 

The 
decision 
comes 
after 

the Washtenaw County Health 
Department issued a stay-in-place 
recommendation from Jan. 27 to Feb. 
7 to contain an increase in COVID-
19 cases as well as an outbreak of 
the new highly transmissible B.1.1.7 
variant of COVID-19, the latter 
which led to a two-week pause of all 
U-M athletics. 

Additionally, Schlissel announced 

University students currently make 
up almost half of positive COVID-19 
tests in Washtenaw County.

In an email to The Michigan Daily, 

Emily Toth Martin, an associate 

professor of epidemiology at the 
School of Public Health, explained 
the reasoning behind the decision to 
test graduate students. 

“We 
are 
seeing 
a 
higher 

proportion of cases occurring in 
graduate students overall compared 
to at this point last semester,” Martin 
wrote. “Concerns about the potential 
of a more transmissible variant 
heightens the need to make sure that 
people in any group residence hall is 
being tested regularly.” 

Martin, a key player in the 

University administration’s response 
to COVID-19, wrote the University 
was offering free testing to residents 
of Ann Arbor in an effort to help 
the Washtenaw County Health 
Department and the Michigan 
Department of Health and Human 
Services respond to B.1.1.7 variant 
infections.

“This testing is being offered 

through the county, and the state 
and county are offering additional 
nearby testing sites that are updated 
regularly on their website,” Martin 
wrote. “We are working together 
with the county to test both students 
and community members living 
close to campus at the IM Sports 
Building.”

Ann Arbor residents who are 

not experiencing any symptoms of 
COVID-19 and have not had a recent 
exposure to the virus can get tested 

at the Intramural Sports Building on 
Mondays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 
Wednesdays and Fridays from 1 p.m. 
to 5 p.m. until Feb. 28. There is no 
sign-up required to be tested.

In an email to The Daily, Dr. 

Lindsey Mortenson, the University 
Health Service medical director 
and the chief of UHS Psychiatry 
Clinic, wrote that pop-up testing is 
occuring in areas where an increase 
of COVID-19 cases have been found.

“Students 
in 
quarantine 
& 

isolation housing have either already 
tested positive, or had a high-risk 
exposure,” Mortenson wrote. “For 
students in the latter category, UHS 
and DPSS deliver test kits to them 
directly.”

Martin wrote the transition to 

indoors due to cold weather and 
concerns for increased cases during 
the winter was the cause of this 
sudden expansion in U-M’s testing 
capability. 

“We are hoping that we will be 

able to get as many local students 
to participate in weekly testing as 
we can,” Martin wrote. “Numbers 
will naturally go up as we test more 
thoroughly, but we hope this will 
ultimately reduce the number of 
big outbreaks that occur on and off-
campus.”

The University of Michigan 

announced it is “optimistic and 
hopeful” for a more normal 
semester in Fall 2021 on Monday 
evening, 
though 
no 
official 

decisions have been made. A tweet 
from the official U-M account 
said U-M staff and faculty are 
working hard to go back to more 
in-person classes in the fall.

“While no decisions have been 

made regarding fall term, we 
remain optimistic it will be much 
more normal,” the tweet reads. 
“Faculty, staff & leadership are all 
eager to do their part to return to 
as normal a semester as possible 
& appreciate your patience & 
understanding.”

In a longer announcement 

sent 
to 
U-M 
parents, 

U-M 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
emphasized 
the 

administration’s 
eagerness 

for greater normality in the 
fall. He wrote the University 
will continue to follow public 
health 
recommendations 

going into Fall 2021, meaning 
campus will likely not be 
completely as it was pre-
March 2020.

“The 
university 
will, 
of 

course, make decisions about 
the fall term that are informed 
by the then current status of the 
pandemic in our region and heed 
the advice of our campus, local 
and state public health officials,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “It is likely 
that some public health safety 
precautions will remain in place 
in the fall, such as wearing face 
coverings and maintaining social 
distancing.” 

In the University’s COVID-

19 briefing on Feb. 12, Chief 
Health Officer Preeti Malani 
reiterated 
the 
hope 
that 

things will continue to get 
better on campus. Martino 
Harmon, vice president for 
student 
life, 
said 
Student 

Life and Michigan Housing 
are continuously working to 
find a best-case fall housing 
situation and planning for 
multiple possible scenarios, 
though he did specify what 
scenarios 
Student 
Life 
is 

considering. 

Rich 
Holcomb, 
associate 

vice 
president 
for 
human 

resources, said at the briefing 
that most non-teaching staff 
hope to continue to work from 
home in the fall, which he said 
would not impact a potentially 
“in-person” 
semester. 

According to a survey released 
in last Friday’s briefing, 87% 
of the U-M staff is interested 
in continuing remote or hybrid 
work after the pandemic. 

While 
the 
University 

eventually aims to distribute 
vaccines to everybody who 
wants one, Fitzgerald wrote 
they still don’t have enough 
to make this a reality. Fall 
semester hinges on vaccine 
availability, Fitzgerald wrote.

“The big unknown remains 

the availability of the vaccine, 
which today is in very short 
supply,” Fitzgerald wrote. “We 
have developed the capacity to 
vaccinate as many as 25,000 
persons per week and remain 
ready to provide vaccines for all 
members of our community who 
wish to be vaccinated according 
to state guidelines once supplies 
are adequate.”

Fitzgerald 
concluded 
the 

announcement by acknowledging 
the toll the pandemic has taken 
on both the University and the 
nation. 

“Finally, 
we 
want 
to 

acknowledge that the ongoing 
uncertainty of the pandemic is 
wearing on all of us,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “It’s been emotionally 
draining as each of us has had to 
adjust our work and personal lives 
to appropriately respond to this 
public health crisis that already 
has claimed the lives of 485,000 
Americans.” 

COVID-19 cases and death rates 

are highest in correlation with the 
percentage of racial and ethnic 
minorities in a county’s population, 
researchers from the University of 
Michigan Institute for Healthcare 
Policy and Innovation have found. 

The 
group 
of 
researchers 

developing this study told The 
Michigan Daily they wanted to 
compare the importance of social 
factors with the rate communities 
are contracting COVID-19, as 
well as the communities that are 
suffering the most deaths. 

The researchers used the Social 

Vulnerability Index to analyze the 
vulnerability and disadvantage 
of each community in a broad 
domain, according to Renuka 
Tipirneni, assistant professor of 
internal medicine. This index 
was developed by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
to analyze how social factors 
influence a community’s COVID-
19 risk.

According to an article by 

Michigan News, the SVI gives 
each county a 10-point score to 
analyze how social measures 

influence the number of cases 
in each county. Some examples 
of these measures are poverty 
rate, income and education level, 
housing type and English language 
ability. The measures also include 
single-parent families, percentage 
of people over 65 or under 17, 
access to a personal vehicle, racial 
and ethnic minority population 
percentage and disability.

Monita Karmakar, a senior 

statistician 
with 
the 
division 

of general medicine within the 
department of internal medicine, 
said the main goal of the research 
was to see if a social association 
existed 
between 
the 
social 

demographic risk factors and U.S. 
COVID-19 incidence and mortality 
rate at a county-level analysis.

“Initially, when the COVID-

19 pandemic hit the U.S., we saw 
a lot of incidents and mortality 
and a lot of burden of the disease 
amongst minority communities,” 
Karamakar 
said. 
“Which 
led 

us to think that there might be 
some kind of neighborhood-level 
disadvantage that increases one’s 
chances of getting the disease 
and eventually mortality from the 
disease.”

Tipirneni said the group found 

that the higher the level of SVI 

or disadvantage, the higher the 
number of COVID-19 cases and 
deaths were in that county.

As vaccines are beginning to 

be distributed across the state, 
Tipirneni said she believes this 
index could also benefit the state 
of Michigan with targeting the 
supply and demand of distributing 
vaccines.

“This index is already being 

used in a variety of ways that I 
think are useful, and then we 
could think of other ways to use 
it in the future,” Tipirneni said. 
“The state health department in 
Michigan has actually been using 
the Social Vulnerability Index to 
target specific communities at 
higher risk for increased testing 
for 
COVID-19 
for 
increased 

resources.”

Since the beginning of the 

pandemic, there have been many 
counties in Michigan that have 
been known as hotspots due to 
the increased amount of COVID-
19 cases in that area. Tipirnei 
shared that the countries with 
the most cases at the time of their 
analysis were Macomb, Wayne 
and Oakland Counties.

Student COVID-19 cases represent 
nearly half of total county cases

University of Michigan officials 

reported an increase in positive 
COVID-19 
cases 
among 
U-M 

students Friday, mainly attributed to 
large off-campus social gatherings. 
According to an email from U-M 
President Mark Schlissel, University-
related COVID-19 cases currently 
comprise nearly half of total cases 
in Washtenaw County — up from a 
third of total cases on Feb. 3. 

“We are seeing increases in 

student COVID-19 cases, spread 
across all levels of students and 
largely due to social gatherings,” 
Schlissel’s email reads. “New cases 
amongst faculty and staff are at a 

low level and are not increasing. 
Overall, U-M cases represent about 
half of the total cases in Washtenaw 
County.”

This 
increase 
occurred 

one week after the end of 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department’s 
stay-in-place 

recommendation and Michigan 
Athletics’ 
two-week 
halt 

on all athletic activity. The 
recommendation and athletic 
pause were mainly in response 
to diagnosed cases of the more 
contagious 
B.1.1.7 
variant 

among U-M students. 

As of Feb. 5, there are 23 cases 

of the B.1.1.7 variant diagnosed in 
Washtenaw County. All cases are 
associated directly or indirectly with 
the University.

Under 
the 
stay-in-place 

recommendation, 
students 
were 

permitted to leave their residence for 
in-person classes, work and research. 
Students were also permitted to 
obtain food and medical supplies, 
among other exceptions. 

At Friday’s weekly COVID-19 

briefing, Dr. Robert Ernst, director 
of University Health Services and 
chair of the Campus Health Response 
Committee, said the rate of off-campus 
positive cases flattened during the 
stay-in-place recommendation but 
have once again spiked.

“We’re worried because we are 

tracking these cases back to off-
campus social activity,” Ernst said. 
“When we see bunches of cases 
come in after a party or something 
like that, it really is disruptive to the 

system.”

In the past two weeks, there 

have been 1103 positive cases in 
Washtenaw County and the weekly 
positivity rate is 2.6%.

As of Feb. 16, graduate students 

coming to campus regularly are 
required to undergo weekly COVID-
19 testing through the Community 
Sampling and Tracking Program. 
Undergraduates living on campus 
or using campus facilities have been 
required to participate in mandatory 
testing since the beginning of the 
semester. The compliance rate for 
mandatory weekly testing among 
undergraduates on campus has been 
95% or higher, Schlissel wrote.

Fact or fiction? Reviewing claims 
about Regent Ronald Weiser

Since telling Bridge Michigan 

he didn’t know if he blamed former 
President Donald Trump for inciting 
the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol 
last month and that he watched the 
Michigan basketball game instead of 
the coverage of the riot, University of 
Michigan Regent Ronald Weiser (R) 
has been subject to a generous amount 
of criticism from U-M students and 
faculty.

Community members have called 

for his resignation in a petition that 
has garnered over 4,900 signatures 
since Jan. 8. Hundreds of faculty, 
staff and students also signed onto an 
open letter to Weiser and members 
of the University’s administration 
demanding he resign. In addition, 
the University’s Central Student 
Government has discussed a potential 
resolution calling for his resignation.

Soon after, emails Weiser sent 

to fellow regents and University 
President Mark Schlissel requesting 
their support amid the backlash came 
to light, one of which called on regents 
to “remember Germany in the 1930’s.” 
Older emails in which he called 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
members on strike “union hacks” and 
sent only an image of a woman in a 
bikini also surfaced.

Various 
other 
claims 
about 

Weiser’s relationship to the Michigan 
Republican Party, his real estate 
holdings in Ann Arbor and his 
donations to the University have 
also been circulating. Some of these 
claims are verifiable while others are 
not. The Michigan Daily put together 
a guide to what we know to be fact, 
what we know to be false and what 
cannot be verified.

Did Weiser refuse to condemn 

the rioters who stormed the 
Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021?

After 
initially 
failing 
to 

condemn 
the 
insurrection 
in 

a Jan. 7 interview with Bridge 
Michigan, 
Weiser 
tweeted 
a 

statement, writing that he strongly 
condemned “those people who 
turned into a mob and breached the 
capitol after what was supposed to 
be a peaceful protest.”

Weiser has since told The 

Detroit News he was undergoing 
dental surgery at the time of the 
riots to explain why he missed 
initial coverage. Weiser continued 
to condemn the riots in the weeks 
following. In a Feb. 8 email to The 
Daily, Weiser wrote that he has 
“clearly condemned the violence 
and the people who perpetrated 
it.”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald also referred The Daily to 
a statement on the insurrection from 
the Office of the President, writing that 
all of the regents, including Weiser, 
support Schlissel’s condemnation of 
the pro-Trump rioters. 

“Today’s 
violence 
represents 

an assault on our liberty and the 
fundamental values of American 
democracy,” the statement reads. “We 
condemn all those who participate 
in or instigate such an attack on our 
nation.”

Did Weiser refuse to condemn 

former President Donald Trump 
for inciting the Jan. 6 violence? 

In the same Jan. 7 interview with 

Bridge, Weiser answered “I don’t 
know,” when asked whether Trump 
was responsible for inciting the 
violence. Since then, he has yet to name 
Trump — or any other individuals — 
as responsible for the insurrection. 
Trump’s second impeachment trial is 
set to begin Tuesday, where he faces 
charges of inciting violence at the 
Capitol.

In his statement on Twitter 

following the publication of the 
Bridge article, Weiser referenced yet 
did not condemn Trump, writing 
“the President said this morning that 
a peaceful of power will occur and 
therefore the 2020 elections are over.”

Weiser made similar remarks in a 

Jan. 9 Twitter thread, stating “People 
were misled. And that resulted in 
death and destruction” without 
naming any party responsible for the 
misinformation.

In a Jan. 19 interview with The 

Daily, when asked whether Trump 
was among those responsible for 
inciting the violence, Schlissel also did 
not directly say if he thought Trump 
held responsibility. 

“I chose my words very carefully 

on purpose,” Schlissel said. “(It’s) up to 
all of us to interpret what’s been going 
on publicly and figure out those who 
are responsible for inciting violence.” 

Does Weiser have ties to the pro-

Trump rioters?

Weiser is the incoming chairman 

of the Michigan GOP, which he will 
co-chair with Meshawn Maddock, 
a 2020 state presidential elector who 
worked to overturn Michigan’s 2020 
general election results. Maddock 
organized buses to transport Michigan 
Trump supporters to Washington, 
D.C. the day of the insurrection and 
at one point marched among them, 
according to a tweet from her account 
that afternoon. She has since publicly 
condemned the violence and claimed 
the rally was supposed to be peaceful. 

In the early afternoon of Jan. 6 

before Trump supporters breached 
the U.S. Capitol building, Maddock 
tweeted that the rally marching 
toward the Capitol was the “most 
incredible crowd and sea of people 
I’ve ever walked with (heart emoji).” 

Weiser told Bridge that he does not 

believe Maddock “incited” the violence 
and said she watched the chaos of the 
riot from her hotel window.

“I don’t believe she was part of 

it,” Weiser said. “I don’t believe she 
incited it.”

What is Weiser’s relationship to 

the Michigan GOP?

On Feb. 6, Weiser was officially 

elected chairman of the Michigan GOP, 
following last-minute allegations from 
the outgoing Chairwoman Laura Cox 
that he made undisclosed payments to 
urge a Secretary of State candidate to 
withdraw, possibly violating campaign 
finance law. On Monday, Michigan’s 
Bureau of Elections launched an 
investigation into these allegations.

Weiser is now the highest-ranking 

member in the state party. He was 
previously elected to this position in 
2009 and 2017, stepping down in 2019 
due to health issues. 

When asked about the potential 

conflict of interest in holding this 
position while also serving as a 
regent, Fitzgerald wrote holding 
both positions is not uncommon 
for governing boards at universities 
around the state, especially given the 
partisan statewide electoral processes 
by which regents are selected at the 
University and other state institutions. 

“Involvement with one political 

party or another is typically expected 
of candidates for the governing boards 
at U-M, MSU and Wayne State, where 
board members are nominated by 
the political parties and elected on a 
statewide ballot,” Fitzgerald wrote.

Weiser also denied there is a 

conflict of interest between his 
position as a regent in his Feb. 8 email 
to The Daily. “The board of regents 
is not involved in politics,” Weiser 
wrote. “It is involved in the oversight 
of the university.”

Currently, no fellow regent holds 

a position of equal rank in their 
respective state political party, but 
other regents have held similar 
positions. For instance, before being 
elected to the Board of Regents in 
2018, Jordan Acker served as deputy 
communications director for the 
Michigan Democratic Party. He was 
also appointed by President Barack 
Obama as an attorney-adviser to 
Secretary Janet Napolitano at the 
Department of Homeland Security in 
2011.

How else has Weiser been 

involved in Republican politics?

In addition to his history with 

the Michigan GOP, Weiser has also 
held positions with the national 
Republican Party.

From 2011 to 2013, he served as the 

Republican National Committee’s 
national finance chairman. He 
was also one of the vice chairs on 
Trump’s finance committee, where 
he was tapped to raise money for 
Trump’s election in 2016. Outside 
of these roles, Weiser has also 
been involved in the campaigns 
of other prominent Republican 
officeholders, including the late U.S. 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine, and former 
President George W. Bush.

Weiser also worked with Betsy 

and Dick DeVos — former Trump 
education secretary, and Michigan 
businessman 
and 
gubernatorial 

candidate, respectively — to pass 
Right-to-Work legislation for the state 
of Michigan in 2013, which creates 
provisions for workers to hold a job 
without paying labor union dues. 

Is Weiser a major landlord in 

Ann Arbor?

Weiser is the founder of McKinley 

Associates Inc., a national real estate 
company headquartered in Ann 
Arbor, from which he got most of 
his wealth. The company owns 
and/or manages several apartment 
complexes in Ann Arbor, as well as 
properties around the country valued 
in excess of $4.6 billion, according to 
the company’s website.

Fitzgerald asserted that Weiser 

is no longer active in the company. 
Weiser confirmed this in an email 
to The Daily, stating he retired from 
the company in 2001 as part of the 
requirements when he was nominated 

by the Bush administration to serve as 
U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia.

Does 
Weiser’s 
real 
estate 

company profit from University 
of Michigan students living on or 
near campus?

According to Weiser, McKinley’s 

apartments in Ann Arbor are not 
within walking distance from Central 
Campus and are primarily marketed 
as “workforce housing,” which the 
company independently confirmed in 
an email to The Daily.

Fitzgerald wrote that it is the 

University’s 
understanding 
that 

McKinley “does not have significant 
holdings near the U-M campus.” 

In the Monday email to The Daily, 

Weiser wrote that McKinley has “no 
undergraduate student housing.”

But the company indicated that 

they do lease their properties to 
students attending the University 
but 
also 
to 
students 
from 

neighboring 
colleges, 
including 

Concordia, 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University 
and 
Washtenaw 

Community College. This is in 
contrast to other Ann Arbor-based 
companies like J. Keller Properties 
and Campus Realty, which market 
themselves as U-M student housing.

Is Weiser a major donor to the 

University, in addition to being a 
regent?

Weiser and his wife have donated 

over $100 million to the University, 
making him a prominent donor.

In recent years, the couple has 

donated millions toward establishing 
the Weiser Diplomacy Center at the 
Ford School of Public Policy, which is 
now named after the pair, as well as a 
real estate center at the Ross School 
of Business. Campus buildings such 
as Weiser Hall take their name from 
the Weiser family.

Did Weiser make a donation to 

influence the University’s plans for 
the fall semester? 

Weiser donated $30 million to 

the University a week before the 
announcement of the University’s 
controversial plans to have an 
in-person, “public-health informed” 
semester, as an anonymous University 
staff member said in an Aug. 27 op-ed. 

However, 
these 
funds 
were 

specifically designated for diabetes 
research, according to MLive. The 
Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes 
Institute, funded by the gift, was 
named after Weiser’s daughter, whose 
husband and children suffer from 
Type 1 diabetes.

Over the summer, Weiser stated 

that many of his donations to the 
University are designated for specific 
purposes, such as food allergy 
research.

When asked if his personal 

donations to the University influence 
the Board of Regents’ decisions for the 
University community, Weiser denied 
the allegation.

“My personal donations do not 

influence the regents’ priorities 
and decisions for the university 
community,” Weiser wrote. “I love 
the university. Over the years, I 
have contributed or committed 
more than $100 million to the 
university, everything from student 
scholarships to centers for medical 
research.”

Board member recently received criticism from some U-M students and faculty

The collection at John K. King Used & Rare Books, located in downtown Detroit, spans over four whole floors in an old industrial building; it is easy to get lost amongst the never-ending shelves.


The Michigan Daily spoke with 

Regent Sarah Hubbard (R), the 
University of Michigan’s newest 
member of the Board of Regents, 
Tuesday to discuss her time in 
office since first joining the Board 
in January. Hubbard is one of two 
Republicans on the Board, the other 
being Ron Weiser, who is currently 
in the midst of controversy after 
calls from some in the U-M 
community for his resignation.

Hubbard 
was 
elected 
in 

November after narrowly defeating 
incumbent Democrat Shauna Ryder 
Diggs by 4,000 votes in a statewide 
election. Hubbard, who grew up on 
a farm in rural Michigan and was 
a Pell Grant-eligible student at the 
University, pitched herself to voters 
on the campaign trail as a moderate, 
bi-partisan candidate who leaned 
right and emphasized lowering 
tuition, protecting freedom of 
expression on campus and bringing 
a “new perspective” to the board. 

There are eight members of 

the Board of Regents who are 
elected to eight-year terms per 
the Constitution of the State of 
Michigan. Elections are staggered, 
and every two years two members 
of the Board of Regents must seek 
re-election. Wayne State University, 
Michigan State University and 
the University of Michigan all 
have elections for their Boards of 
Regents.

The Board of Regents is the most 

powerful body at the University 
and has two main responsibilities: 
hiring 
the 
president 
of 
the 

University 
and 
managing 
the 

budget, which includes tuition.

Before her election to the Board, 

Hubbard held no political office or 
position at the University. Hubbard 
said her “great passion for helping 
the 
University” 
propelled 
her 

expeditious jump to this powerful 
position. 

“I’ve 
been 
very 
active 
in 

working with the alumni groups 
since 
graduating,” 
Hubbard 

said. “And I’ve also had a lot of 
relationships with public officials, 
with the public, with the business 
community across the state and just 
saw an opportunity to serve and a 
way to give back to my University. 
I happened to win with a squeaker 
there last year, and I’m really 
enjoying the opportunity to be 
more engaged.”

Hubbard is the owner of Acuitas 

LLC, a government relations and 
lobbying firm in the state’s capital 
of Lansing. She holds two degrees 
from the University, a bachelor’s 
degree in political science and 
psychology from LSA and an 

MBA from the Ross School of 
Business. She also has a history 
of working with the Republican 
Party, though in the past she has 
donated to Democratic candidates 
in Michigan, including U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell and Sen. Gary 
Peters, D-Mich.

Hubbard’s first official Board 

of Regents meeting is not until 
Feb. 18, but she said she is already 
preparing and getting to know U-M 
administration and student leaders. 

“I’ve been spending a lot of time 

getting to know the leaders of the 
University much better,” Hubbard 

said. “Talking with administration 
leaders, deans, student leaders, 
taking emails from a lot of different 
groups and preparing to meet 
with other groups on campus and 
hearing from a lot of people. … 
While I’ve known the University 
for a long time, I’m getting to know 
it in a much different, better way.” 

Though the Board of Regents 

typically 
handles 
general 

management 
and 
high-level 

oversight 
of 
the 
University, 

Hubbard said she believes the 
Regents are very accessible to 
students and members of the U-M 
community.

“We do receive a lot of emails and 

outreach from students and student 
groups, and we certainly encourage 
students to continue to stay in 
touch with Regents,” Hubbard said. 
“And there are all sorts of things 
that might be on students’ minds, 
especially with COVID. I very much 
appreciate hearing from people and 
what their concerns are, and I want 
to hear from people. I want to hear 
from students and families and 
parents and faculty — all of you.”

Hubbard said being a Regent 

has gone how she expected it to so 
far and spoke about the “learning 
curve” of becoming a Regent.

“I thought it would be very tense 

and that it would be relatively time-
consuming, and it is … but as far as 
actual surprises, I don’t know that 
I have anything in particular that 
I would point to,” Hubbard said. 
“It’s just such a steep learning curve 
right now, and a lot of items and 
issues are new to me at this point.”

Hubbard has been assigned to 

the Health Affairs Committee on 
the board, an important position 
in the middle of a global pandemic. 
According to the bylaws of the Board 
of Regents, the committee provides 
oversight of the University’s clinical 
enterprise, including the health 
system.

After experiencing what she 

described as a hostile environment 
due 
to 
her 
all-white 
female 

roommates 
in 
her 
sophomore 

year dorm, Lorraine Furtado, a 
University of Michigan class of 2020 
alum, found sanctuary in the Inter-
Cooperative Council, a housing 
cooperative operating numerous 
houses across Ann Arbor. Though 
the situation was an improvement, 
Furtado said microaggressions and 
hostility persisted. 

“I wanted to demand more for 

myself, and I knew I deserved to 
demand more for myself,” Furtado 
said. 

So in 2019, Furtado began 

planning to transform her former 
home — the Lester Cooperative 
House — into a safe space for Queer 
and Transgender People of Color 
like herself. The ICC co-ops are 
maintained and operated by the 
student members who live there, 
rather than a landlord.

Members of Lester participated 

in 
house 
meetings 
about 

re-theming the house. After an 
almost unanimous vote in favor of 
re-theming among house members, 
they brought it to the ICC, where 

it was later approved in November 
2019, according to Furtado.

Members voted to rename the 

house after Sylvia Rivera, one of the 
leading activists in the Gay Libration 
Movement.

“I cried from joy,” Furtado said. 

“It was such a beautiful moment to 
know that my housemates cared 
about the vision I had. They cared 
about the community I wanted to 
create, and they agreed with me 
about it. And it was so meaningful 
to know that my housemates cared 
about a safe space for QTPOC as 
much as I did.”

The change in making Lester 

the Rivera House will be effective 

in Fall 2021. The house, which was 
previously all-vegetarian, will no 
longer have any dietary restrictions. 

Rivera will operate year-round. 

They accept applications from any 
University students as well as other 
people in the Ann Arbor area who 
meet the ICC’s eligibility criteria. 

Approving Rivera House
According to Furtado the process 

of getting Rivera approved was a 
difficult one. She said while working 
to obtain approval for Rivera, 
ICC leadership “did not create an 
inclusive environment” for her and 
was hostile.

“I would cry after every single 

board meeting, my housemates 

would have to caravan to come pick 
me up because I would be so upset 
after board meetings, because I 
frankly felt bullied,” Furtado said. “I 
didn’t feel like I was a voice that they 
wanted to be there, and that was 
really tough mentally to know that.”

Furtado said she was treated 

poorly by the ICC board in a meeting 
to discuss a large financial decision 
regarding Rivera. 

“The main reason people had 

pushback was because it would 
require so much red tape, so many 
legal resources, it would require so 
much forethought and planning,” 
Furtado said.

LSA junior Amaya Farrell, a 

vice president in the ICC, said that 
according to meeting minutes, 
the major concerns were legal 
wording for fair housing laws. 
Farrell, who was not on the board 
at the time of the meeting, said she 
spoke with members attending 
that meeting who told her some of 
the representatives were fixated 
on the legal wording, which was 
not the focus of the proposal being 
discussed.

“The (two ICC Vice Presidents) 

could 
tell 
there 
was 
tension 

(because) one board rep continually 
worried about the legality in a 
nonproductive and non-appropriate 
manner for the time, and after the 
proposal passed the communication 
norms were talked about to remind 
(people) what they had agreed on 
for communication and behavior,” 
Farrell wrote in a text message to 
The Daily.

When asked about the criticisms 

and negative member experiences, 
current ICC President Julian Tabron, 
a Rackham student, acknowledged 
members feeling unwelcome or 
marginalized in the past. 

“We do membership surveys and 

compare it (the data) with U of M, 
and we had a diversity issue a couple 
of years ago to a point where the ICC 
was less diverse than U of M, which 
was disappointing to me,” Tabron 
said. “I’m African-American and 
Native American, and I am trying 
to work towards making this a more 
welcoming environment, and I think 
that’s part of what Rivera is trying to 
do for marginalized individuals.”

To prevent situations like Furtado’s 

from taking place again, Tabron said 
there are bystander intervention 
training and microaggression training 
sessions open to all members of the 
ICC, as well as the dispute action 

and resolution team which handles 
internal conflicts within the co-op 
houses. The training sessions have 
worked in the past, Tabron said, and 
have helped the ICC break ties with 
racist and prejudicial members.

Tabron said he sympathizes 

with those who have experienced 
discrimination and uncomfortable 
situations within the co-ops. 

“I’m sorry some members felt 

alienated or discriminated against 
in the past. As a member, I’ve 
experienced 
that 
too,” 
Tabron 

said. “I think the ICC is heading in 
a more positive, better direction 
where 
we 
can 
foster 
better 

healthy relationships in our own 
communities. We’re still working on 
it — it’s a work in progress.”

University alum Ramin Samei, 

who also worked to re-theme the 
house, experienced more support 
from the ICC. Samei said COVID-19 
has been a challenge in transitioning 
Lester into Rivera.

“There has been a lot of support 

for this idea from within the ICC, 
like a ton of support from our board 
and from the staff, in making this 
dream a reality,” Samei said. “I think 
some of the challenges have been 
that we have so many people coming 
together on this, and all of us are 
going through the pandemic … this 
is a hard time to start anything. But I 
think overall, I’ve had a pretty good 
time (with) it just because there’s 
been such good support.”

The future ahead for Rivera 

House

Furtado said Rivera is at the 

forefront of real change for QTPOC 
students, in comparison to what 
she sees as failed attempts at 
transformation by the University 
and some of its organizations and 
initiatives. 

“On 
UMich’s 
campus, 
there 

are so many empty shows of racial 
solidarity from white folks that are 
just really performative, and they’re 
shells of what they could be, and we 
didn’t want to do that,” Furtado said. 
“We wanted to be explicitly clear that 
this is something that will actually 
cause change and create a safe space 
and isn’t just putting a band-aid on 
all of the racial issues on campus, 
which so many initiatives have just 
done, if I’m being completely honest. 
We wanted something that would 
actually be transformative.”

Student parents talk struggles 
of academia, work-life balance 

during the pandemic

As the U.S. nears one year since 

the initial spread of the COVID-19 
pandemic, many schools and day 
care centers have yet to regularly 
remain 
open. 
For 
University 

of Michigan Graduate Student 
Instructors 
and 
undergraduate 

students who are parents, this 
means trying to balance school, 
work and child care at home every 
day. 

Work-life balance difficulties
Even 
before 
the 
pandemic, 

student parents at the University 
have 
discussed 
the 
lack 
of 

institutional 
support. 
Rackham 

student 
Valerie 
Micol 
works 

as a GSI and researcher for the 
University and has a 10-year-old 
child. She said working from home 
during the pandemic has wrecked 
her work-life balance. 

“I’m supposed to be writing 

a dissertation,” Micol said. “It’s 
supposed to be the most cognitively 
demanding work that I need to do … 
And then I’m just at home with my 
10-year-old, being a fifth grade one-
on-one teacher’s aide for her. I don’t 
want to be super dramatic, but it 
feels like (working from home) has 
just ruined a lot.” 

The shift to working at home 

has also heightened the gender 
imbalance in the workplace, as 
student parents who are women 
are more likely to be more affected 
by the burden of juggling both 
professional work and parenting. 

The hardest thing about working 

from home with a child, Micol said, 
has been the fact that her attention 
is always divided. 

“It’s like having a loud, rowdy 

lab mate or co-worker who’s 
interrupting all the time,” Micol 
said. “Even when she’s relatively 

subdued or we have good days, it’s 
just still cognitively demanding, to 
be on all the time in two settings.” 

Ph.D. candidate Ruby Mochida 

is currently a GSI teaching modern 
Chinese culture and is also the 
mother of two children, ages two 
and five. She said she moved in with 
her mother in New Hampshire over 
the summer for help with child 
care. 

Being both a mom and a 

GSI, Mochida also said she has 
struggled with feeling isolated and 
misunderstood.

“I think it’s just a fact that unless 

you’re a mom, you don’t understand 
the situation,” Mochida said. “So 
I have to prove the reality to my 
department, and it feels like they 
don’t believe that it’s really that bad 
or something is really hard.”

Ph.D. candidate Hanah Stiverson 

has two school-aged children. 
Stiverson said she is constantly 
interrupted throughout the day and 
finds it difficult to stay focused.

Stiverson said she has found 

herself getting more exhausted 
during the day than she used to, 
causing her to feel behind.

“I know personally, I’ve got a 

lot of timeline goals and personal 
expectations that I set for myself,” 
Stiverson said. “And working in a 
way that has combined my home 
life, with my work life, with my 
parenting life, with trying to reach 
these goals for fellowships and 
going on the job market in a year 
— all that’s combined into this ball 
of stress that’s really hard to work 
through.” 
Fighting for greater protections

During their strike last fall, The 

Graduate Employees’ Organization 
included allowing student parents 
to use their University-allotted 
child care money for non-licensed 
care in their list of demands sent 
to 
University 
administration. 

Allowing this change was one of the 
concessions the University made to 
GEO to end the strike. 

In addition to extending the 

policy to include an option for 
funding unlicensed childcare, the 
University increased the age limit 
to qualify for this aid to include 
children up to the age of 15 without 
disabilities. 
The 
previous 
and 

existing policies cover children 
with special needs up to the age 
of 19. The temporary program 
instituted by the University also 
allocated an additional $500,000 to 
unlicensed childcare, as requested 
by GEO. 

This demand followed a group 

of Rackham students with children 
publishing an opinion piece in The 
Michigan Daily in August 2020. The 
group discussed their experiences 
and struggles and asked the 
University to issue a statement of 
support and guide departments in 
mitigating the impact of COVID-19 
on student parents.

Micol said though the child care 

funding concessions were helpful, 
she thinks the University needs to 
do more. 

“Part of the child care subsidy is 

that your child has to be enrolled on 
75% of the weeks of the semester, 
which is something like maybe 12 
weeks or 13 weeks,” Micol said. 
“But they give you like $2,000, and 
that’s going to cover only six weeks 
or (so) … I honestly think that the 
unlicensed care piece was just 
such a low hanging fruit that the 
University could have done without 
strike.” 

Though Mochida moved in with 

her mother for child care, she said 
she was unable to use any of the 
subsidy to pay her mother for taking 
care of her child.

Kota the Friend moves toward 
closure on ‘Lyrics to GO, Vol. 2’

The title is accurate — Lyrics to 

GO, Vol. 2 is all about the message 
indie rapper Kota the Friend wants 
to leave you with. The flow of words 
— words of gratefulness, sadness and 
love — seems to tumble out of Kota 
on this mixtape. Lyrics to GO, Vol. 
2 is not as carefully thought out as 
his previous album Everything, but 
it was released anyway because Kota 
has words he needs the world to hear 
right now, without delay. His lyrics 
stand on their own; there are so many 
things to say that there’s almost no 
time to form a perfect, catchy beat to 
match.

True to Kota’s earlier work, the 

rapper’s mental health challenges are 
carefully ruminated on as gratefulness 
fights to exist alongside them. This 
mixtape is a cathartic processing 
of these conflicting emotions. Over 
pared-back, sunny beats that let the 
ease of his flow shine through, Kota’s 
direct lyrics provide self-reflection. 
His words hold up a mirror to each 
listener — we can connect to this 
mixtape only if we choose to actively 
listen to it. The beats are designed to 
give the words the space they need but 
don’t do enough to draw the listener 
in without a bit of effort. Through his 
openness about his struggles, Kota 
seems to find closure as the mixtape 
progresses.

The starting tracks set the tone for 

the mixtape, with their beats made 
up of guitar or wistful piano, and 
full of grainy fry. In “Luke Cage,” 
Kota speaks in the second person, 
asking the listener to remember 
with him as he welcomes them 
into the album. The memories are 
a mixed bag. In “Clinton Hill,” he 
acknowledges hunger pains of the 
past in the same breath he speaks of 
his thankfulness. On “200 Dollars,” 
his nostalgia takes on a bite as he 
considers the gentrification of his 
hometown, New York City. He longs 
for the metaphorical green grass and 
pound cake he describes that are just 
beyond his grasp at the same time he 
reviles them.

His sadness begins to infiltrate 

the mixtape about halfway through. 
“Created 
everything 
from 
the 

darkness, I still wrote it / I still wear 
my heart on my shoulder / I’m still 
hopin’ for the best, I’m still awake 

when I rest,” he admits in “Broken.” 
Kota’s laid-back vocalization of these 
difficult words keeps the lyrics honest, 
instead of portraying a fabricated 
tortured artist. He acknowledges 
that life has suffering, but it isn’t 
all suffering. Pain fosters growth; 
Kota uses it to develop himself and 
his music. “Thunderstorm coming, 
I sit on the porch and sing through 
it,” he tells us on this same track, 
acknowledging all the little bits of life 
that make it whole. In “Emotionally 
Dumb,” he drives home this point by 
emphasizing that you can be grateful 
even when everything isn’t perfect.

In this same song, Kota drops 

lyrics that just about sum up the 
mixtape: “But I’m workin’ on it, no 
more escapin’ when I’m hurtin’ / 
No more self-sabotage, livin’ against 
my purpose / More appreciation for 
myself when I ain’t perfect / Every 
day I get up and grow, that’s what I 
chose.” 

It is a statement of self-affirmation 

that we are all learning to make for 
ourselves, and hearing it from others 
allows us to share that experience. 
He accepts that growth does not 
mean everything is instantly better 
— it means you want to make things 
improve. 

The profundity of these statements 

makes it seem a shame for them to be 
rushed out with not much thought 
given to their production. Although 
the minimalistic beats give the 
listener space to think about what 
Kota is saying, they don’t add much. 
The lyrics would have a similar effect 
being rhythmically read aloud at a 
poetry slam — there’s musicality in 
Kota’s flow, but not in much else. 

And yet, for now, the words are 

enough. This probably isn’t a mixtape 
that will stand the test of time, but 
it emerges right after the close of a 
year that knocked us all off our feet 
again and again. On “Flowers,” the 
closing track, Kota acknowledges 
that everybody always wants more 
out of life — but right now, this is 
what he can give us. He released this 
mixtape, even though it is not his best 
work, even though it is bare bones 
and sounds like a lot of mediocre 
SoundCloud rap, because it was one of 
those moments when he couldn’t hold 
back what he was thinking. There 
are times where you finally find the 
answer you’ve been searching for for a 
while — Kota can’t keep himself from 
sharing his.

‘Waiting For The Night Song’ is a flimsy nature fiction debut

Albeit flawed, 2020 was a wonderful year 

for debut novels. Some of my favorites — “A 
Burning” by Megha Majumdar, “The Best 
Part of Us” by Sally Cole-Misch and “Burnt 
Sugar” by Avni Doshi, to name a few — kept 
me company during endless hours indoors. 
Other debuts, however, were less thrilling. 
“Waiting For The Night Song,” a nature 
fiction debut by Julie Carrick Dalton, falls 
into this category. 

Dalton’s novel reads like a subdued version 

of Delia Owens’s “Where the Crawdads 
Sing.” Dalton, a journalist, tells the story of 
Cadie, an entomologist who grows up in a 
small town in rural New Hampshire. Young 
Cadie holds the local woods close to her 
heart until a deadly shooting turns her world 
upside down. The novel alternates between 
the present and the past, following Cadie 
and her best friend Daniela as they navigate 
the trauma they’ve inherited. The plot deftly 
intertwines themes of climate change, 
immigration and political polarization to 
create a layered and current story.

Fans of nature fiction will love Dalton’s 

lingering and thoughtful descriptions of our 
planet. “Wind stretched the clouds below her 
like raw cotton on a comb, allowing rusty tips 
of dead pine trees to peek through,” Dalton 
writes when Cadie stands at the peak of a 
mountain. And Cadie is just the type of lovable 
science geek that fellow environmental 
enthusiasts will love. Yet even with these 
luxurious descriptions, Dalton’s writing lacks 
depth and fails to pack a punch. 

Ironic for a thriller, this novel’s greatest 

downfall is its inability to effectively build up 
suspense. However, Dalton does a sufficient 
job of depicting trauma in a realistic and 
understandable way. “All of her experiences 
and memories were either before or after the 
gunshot,” Dalton writes of Cadie. Readers 
see how trauma lingers, appearing during 
otherwise ordinary moments with an intensity 
that transports you back to the incident itself. 
Yet, the events of the plot happen suddenly and 
without warning. Without suspense, readers 
don’t understand the gravity of situations that 
are meant to be transformative or traumatic for 
the characters. 

Similar to the plot, the romance in 

“Waiting For The Night Song” happens 
quickly and without any significant buildup. 
The relationship between Cadie and Garrett, 
a child across the lake that Cadie met during 
the fateful summer of the shooting, feels 
forced. Cadie and Garrett have had a handful 
of conversations together, yet when Cadie 
returns to her childhood woods nearly thirty 
years later, Garrett is suddenly all she can 
think about. “I think I’ve been waiting for you 
my whole life,” Cadie says, a phrase that was 
quite literally hard to read. How absurd this 
relationship feels isn’t a consequence of the 
character building, but because the plot lacks 
a sense of urgency and depth. It’s difficult 
to understand the strength of Cadie and 
Garrett’s bond when they only met for one 
summer at the ripe age of eleven years old. 

Despite its flaws, “Waiting For The Night 

Song” does have a bright side. Climate 
change-themed fiction is a hard genre 
to master while retaining an interested 
audience, and Dalton does a wonderful 

job weaving the acute threat of climatic 
warming into the plot. Cadie’s forest is 
both depicted as a comforting refuge and 
a landscape threatened with fire. “Silence 
lived at the top of mountains and deep in 
the woods, where the nuances of worms 
under soil, insects in the air, trees exhaling, 
and animals wooing gave dimension to the 
quiet,” Dalton eloquently writes, reminding 
us all of the serenity found outdoors. But 
when those same woods are on fire, the 
landscape is unrecognizable, the flames 
depicted as “harmony and melody thrashing 
with unrestrained grace” as they hungrily 
devour the forest trees. 

The dual depiction of the environment 

— as both a safe haven and something 
under constant threat of destruction — is 
a poignant reminder that we don’t have 
much time left before many of our local 
landscapes begin to resemble California, 
Australia or the Amazon. Dalton allows us 
to take comfort in our surroundings while 
also reminding us how much it would hurt 
to lose them. I think of this in nearly every 
encounter I have with the natural world — a 
peaceful moment walking through a grove 
of pine trees suddenly seems more sinister 
when I realize this same stand likely won’t 
be here in 50 years, when the climate of 
Michigan is projected to resemble present-
day Arkansas. 

Even with these highlights on climate 

change, this novel still unforgivably lacks 
in plot and substance. It’s easy to turn the 
pages, but the story’s lack of urgency makes 
it ultimately unfulfilling. “Waiting For The 
Night Song” is a light, easy read, but don’t 
expect it to rock your world.

Samantha Power in conversation with Laura Dern

Last 
week, 
publishing 

company HarperCollins hosted 
an event to help raise money 
for local bookstores. In their 
timely exploration of the human 
experience 
extrapolated 
to 

the universality of the human 
condition, actress Laura Dern 
and writer Samantha Power 
mingled in a conversation that 
was not simply an overview of 
Power’s life story, but instead a 
discussion of the driving forces 
at play in her new memoir, “The 
Education of an Idealist.”

As 
the 
former 
U.S. 

Presidential Ambassador to the 
United Nations under Barack 
Obama and as someone who is 
in many ways legally bound by 
public opinion, Power’s memoir 
demonstrates 
her 
effort 
to 

expose the roots of her fierce 
commitment to empathy. She 
wants to make you, the audience 
and the reader, more aware of 
the parts of her life that manage 
to defy the myth-making of 
American success. She wants 
you to know all this because 
she’s aware that there’s a chance 
it might resonate with her 
readers’ lives.

During the conversation, which 

was hosted by Literati Bookstore 
in conjunction with a network of 
local bookstores nationwide as a 
fundraising effort, Power worked 
ardently to demystify the shadow 
life haunting the background 
of her success by discussing the 
transmission of her idealism 
from a patrilineal line down to 
her: a transmission mirroring 
the 
spiritual 
guidance 
she 

offers in the form of a dazzling, 
knocked-down 
romanticism 

for the endurance of the human 
condition that refuses to stay 
down. Through her resistance 
to power structures known to 
oppress and marginalize, Power 
refuses to rant or lay blame on 
individuals. 

Rather, 
both 
during 
the 

conversation with Dern and in 
her memoir, Power turns the 
magnifying glass of reporting 
on herself. In doing so, she 
resists the polarizing idea that 
politicians are only interested 
in the power encircling their 
roles in government. She also 
repeatedly 
emphasizes 
the 

importance 
of 
mapping 
the 

universal onto the particular, 
atomistic 
functions 
of 
the 

human in isolation, whether it 
be quarantine-induced or the 
belief that you are uniquely 
alone with your burdens.

In the process of doing so, 

she delved deeper into her 
personal background than most 
politicians and their staffers 
tend to disclose outright, even 
in the aftermath of publishing 
a memoir. Dern, a clear admirer 
of Power, magnified Power’s 
commitment to empathy and 
how it’s manifested in the form 
of 
a 
powerful, 
trail-blazing 

curiosity.

“That’s not normal (or) innate 

curiosity,” Dern observed.

Power 
expanded 
upon 

Dern’s observation — as she 
excelled at doing throughout 
— by explaining how, when 
she was growing up in Ireland, 
the constant exposure to her 
father’s catalog of narratives 
from customers at his pub played 
an oversized role in shaping her 
empathically-leaning interests. 
She further explained that, due 
to the vividness of her father’s 
storytelling, it felt as if a cast of 
characters sat beside the rest of 
her family at the dinner table as 
she came of age.

Power expressed an avid 

appreciation 
for 
the 
moral 

integrity 
displayed 
by 
her 

father while she was growing 
up. “When you’re at the pub, 
everyone’s equal,” she said, 
referencing her father’s views 
on the human condition. “What 
people (in the pub) care about is 
… Can you tell the story’s arc and 
hold an audience?”

Power continued on to say 

that, “what (she’s) inherited 
from (her father) is the ability 
to tell a story and bridge a 
distance.”

While 
this 
type 
of 

storytelling might be expected 
given the framing of a memoir, 
what I didn’t expect was the 
interpersonal validation shared 
between Power and Dern, across 
two 
disparate 
professions, 

politics and acting — that of 
finding themselves to be the 
only woman in a room. Where 
the 
promotional 
literature 

of both the memoir and the 
event may have streamlined 
their experiences as that of 
prototypical American success, 
Dern 
and 
Power 
seemed 

intimately entangled in a more 
significant way: Each woman 
spoke of the impacts of resisting 
repression and silence.

This 
segment 
of 
the 

conversation 
began 
with 

Dern asking Power about a 
scene in the book where she 
is summoned to a meeting 
with other women working in 
government. 
Power 
recalled 

being initially annoyed by the 
perceived disruption of this 
summoning but then described 
how she reconfigured it as 
“one of the most cathartic 
experiences of (her) life” while 
she was drafting it into the 
book.

Another, 
personal 

throughline Power emphasized 
during 
the 
conversation 

dealt 
with 
the 
damaging 

emotional ramifications of her 
father’s death from alcoholism. 
Specifically, Power disclosed 
that, despite becoming aware 
that it wasn’t her fault through 
therapy, she questioned her 
own possible role in it. Dern 
didn’t shy away from pointedly 
asking Power how she managed 
to endure the self-interrogation 
required for the narration of 
her life — the articulation of its 
nuances in the writing of her 
memoir — in the wake of her grief:

“What I want to understand 

is, how did you survive the 
guilt of responsibility … How 
did you feel such a deep sense 
of self and let go of old stories?” 
Dern asked, referring to Power’s 
mounting sense of guilt after 
her father’s death, as well as the 
coping mechanisms she utilized 
as a witness to atrocity.

In response, Power explained 

her initial resistance to the idea 
of therapy, as both a woman 
working in American politics 
as well as a first-generation 
immigrant. While she credits 
it with her healing, the long 
answer, for her, is that the 
trauma dealt with in therapy 
never really leaves you or drains 
away through the cathartic 
conversations 
had 
between 

therapist and client. Even still, 
she added that if you are lucky 
enough to do so, you can conduct 
the 
energy 
constructively. 

Power informed Dern that the 
guilt of her father’s death was at 
the core of her decision to go to 
therapy.

The exchange was initially 

propelled by the pair’s personal 
experiences characterized by a 
mutual understanding of what 
it means to build careers in 
male-dominated 
workplaces. 

But it was the accumulation of 
those same experiences, by way 
of what Dern called a “massive 
journey” through the political 
realm, that ultimately secured 
Power’s firm place as a feminist 
icon. That is, as a voice that 
grapples openly on the page 
with the toxicity built into the 
work environment.

In the midst of the desperation 

to 
be 
right 
that 
so 
often 

defines the modern American 
body politic, the refreshing 
commiseration between Dern 
and Power seemed to channel 
their desires, as an actor and 
politician 
respectively, 
to 

embrace the microphone and 
to speak for the betterment of 
the collective through its sonic 
force.

SIERRA ÉLISE HANSEN

There’s 
nothing 
more 

satisfying than turning a key 
in the ignition of a well-oiled 
car. Well, maybe getting crisp 
bills from the ATM, breaking 
the 
smooth 
surface 
of 
a 

freshly-opened jar of peanut 
butter or stepping into a 
boiling shower after being out 
in the cold. There might not 
be a true leader of satisfaction 
to rule them all, but as I 
started my first car early last 
month in the parking lot of a 
Chelsea DMV, I had never felt 
anything like it. 

Driving home at 65 mph on 

the freeway, I bested myself 
yet again: the seat warmer 
toasting 
my 
butt, 
hands 

firmly on the wheel, I reached 
for my phone and turned on 
Pat Benatar. This was the 
life, man. It’s the small things 
after all, right?

Listening to Pat Benatar 

sing-yell “We’re running with 
the shadows of the night” as 
I sped down the highway, I 
thought about that unique 
feeling of satisfaction that 
seemingly 
random 
actions 

create in our daily lives. 
Beyond the one-second hit 
of dopamine that turning 
the radio up might have 
spurred, it was Benatar and 
her 80s contemporaries that 
truly brought me comfort on 
that first drive back to Ann 
Arbor. I could imagine my 
mother doing the same drive 
to visit her sisters here at 
the University of Michigan, 
listening to the same songs 
on 
the 
radio 
screaming 

down a potholed interstate. 
I smiled, losing myself in the 
fake drumbeats and earworm 
rhythms of the music.

The songs that followed by 

Heart, the Pretenders, the 
Go-Gos, Wilson Phillips and 
the like were cheesy, sure, 

but there is truly nothing like 
them. In a period dominated 
by men with teased hair and 
gyrating hips on pyrotechnic 
stages, women like Benatar 
and 
Chrissie 
Hynde 
were 

unabashed in their embrace 
of 
life 
and 
love 
without 

apologies. 

You can pretend to hate 

“Barracuda,” but there’s no 
way you don’t at least know 
the chorus to that song. I 
didn’t know the song Scarlett 
Johansson 
sings 
in 
“Lost 

in Translation” was called 
“Brass in Pocket,” but I’ve 
known the chorus since I was 
seven years old. 

This music might not be 

considered “good taste,” but 
it’s really good. It’s music 
made for real people, for true 
comfort, made to be a catalyst 
for joy. 

I’m not typically a huge 

pop fan either; when I was 
13 I would have let Julian 
Casablancas of The Strokes 
kill me and then said thank 
you as a ghost. I still love a 
good angsty indie track, and 
most of my time as a music 
journalist has been focused 
on people who have less 
than five pieces of colored 
clothing in their closets. But 
there’s just something so 
universal about these 80s 
ladies, whether it is their 
strength, the catchiness of 
every single chorus or their 
very tall hair. 

Their voices are impossibly 

loud, their belts smooth and 
the guitar in the background 
peppy. Listening to them is 
like putting lotion on freshly 
shaved legs, like flipping the 
perfect pancake. I’m running 
out of similes, but you get the 
picture. 

No matter how emo the rest 

of my playlist might get, there 
is always a little space for my 
anthemic friends. Perhaps I’ll 
wear a leotard tomorrow in 
their honor.

‘Judas and the Black Messiah’ says screw the neoliberals

There’s a quote from a 1964 speech 

by Malcolm X that Fred Hampton, 
played by Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out”), 
recounts to the future mother of his 
child, Deborah (Dominique Fishback, 
“The Hate You Give”):

“Sometimes, when a person’s house is 

on fire and someone comes in yelling fire, 
instead of the person who is awakened 
by the yell being thankful, he makes 
the mistake of charging the one who 
awakened him with having set the fire.”

Fred Hampton was murdered 

in his bed after an FBI informant 
named Bill O’Neill, the eponymous 
Judas played by Lakeith Stanfield 
(“Sorry to Bother You”), drugged him 
so that he would be unable to wake 
when the FBI raided his apartment. 
Artist Kerry James Marshall would 
later depict the night of his execution 
in “Black Painting,” illustrating the 
darkness of Hampton’s bedroom, 
evoking the truth that this eerie 
place was meant to be a safe place for 
Hampton, Deborah and their unborn 
child. It’s dangerous enough to be in 

a house on fire, but what they did to 
Fred Hampton reminds us that you 
have to be awake to know the fire’s 
even there.

The film follows Bill’s infiltration 

of the Black Panther Party on behalf 
of the FBI in return for immunity 
from his past crimes. It’s difficult to 
try to sow suspense with historical 
narratives in film when the ending 
is already cataloged in collective 
or digital memory, especially for 
Black people like myself, who know 
the story fairly well. Likewise, 
director Shaka King (“Newlyweds”) 
sometimes struggled to avoid the 
associated cliches of the genre. 

FBI Agent Roy Martin Mitchell 

(Jesse Plemons, “I’m Thinking of 
Ending Things”) has a moment of 
reckoning with the cause he realizes 
he’s fighting for, not saying verbatim 
but still evoking a revelation of, “Wait, 
you’re telling me that the FBI is r-r-r-
racist?!” 

Stanfield’s portrayal of Bill’s struggle 

not to blow his cover at times seems 
more like a closeted kid trying to fit 
in with the football players by talking 
about how hot the popular girl is, than it 
does a blackmailed man worried for his 

life. At one point in the movie, Deborah 
has a moment when she becomes 
worried for Fred’s safety. It seemed 
shoehorned in, like something that a 
white wife of a white activist would 
say to remind the viewers that the film 
considers the female perspective, but 
maybe I’m being harsh.

The cuts to Fred and Deborah’s 

romantic development felt like an 
attempt to level with people who 
might think the Panthers were too 
radical. More and more people have 
been re-educated on the work that 
the Black Panther Party did for 
community health, food and welfare, 
but the bigger picture has sometimes 
been watered down. Shaka King’s 
refusal to shy away from the 
Black Panthers’ denouncement of 
capitalism and encouragement to 
keep people armed dares the viewer 
to consider that these ideas might be 
new, but not unforgivable. 

The opening montage sews together 

clips from Agnes Varda’s (“Cleo from 5 
to 7”) 1962 documentary on the Black 
Panther, b-roll news footage and 
reenacted performances by the cast 
— most notably Kaluuya as Hampton, 
in a scene where he promises not to 

“fight capitalism with black capitalism, 
(but) fight it with socialism.” In the 
age of the imperialist girlboss and 
carceral feminism, it’s brave to show 
that the Black Panther Party was more 
successful in bringing people together 
than any corporate activists of today. 

I’m inclined to be a little cynical 

and think that any success that 
films like this have is based around 
an obsession with Black pain. That 
films like this are nothing more than 
high-budget 
blaxploitation 
films. 

But “Judas” goes beyond that. It’s not 
an easy film to watch, but there are 
glimpses of Black joy that make you 
keep watching. Even knowing it was 
all going to end badly, I still felt warm 
when Fred would feed Deborah or 
when he was embraced by his friends 
upon returning from a stint in prison. 

I’m begging people to see this 

movie as a moral text. Not just 
something to observe but something 
to live by. To reject the individualism 
that O’Neill favored by sacrificing his 
friends for his own betterment and 
instead embrace the collectivism that 
the Party stood for. I struggle with 
the push and pull between wanting 
to decentralize the viewer, to focus 

on what the art is trying to say rather 
than always looking for something 
to relate to. Then again, seeing this 
as only relevant to the ’60s would be 
like looking at Japanese kaiju films as 
monster movies and not reactions to 
nuclear warfare. 

Art is about connection. When I 

read the ten-point program or watch 
videos of Kathleen Cleaver talking 
about her natural hair, I can’t help but 
feel like they’re speaking across time. 
You can’t view this as a race-blind 
story of betrayal. O’Neill did what he 
did because he felt like he had no other 
option as a Black man in America. Not 
some new idea of Trump’s America 
but the America that has always 
existed to maintain a plutocracy. 

I wonder how producer Ryan 

Coogler felt doing this film after 
“Black Panther,” arguably one of the 
performative expressions of Black 
pride, that Hampton himself calls 
out in a scene where he says, “That 
dashiki ain’t gon’ help you when 
they come in here with them tanks.” 
Does he know that giving Disney 
all that cash made him a part of the 
capitalist machine? Does he know 
that Disney is a part of the reason 

why stories like Fred Hampton’s 
are suppressed in favor of whatever 
movie makes the most money or 
can at least be paid for by the U.S. 
military?

Still, Shaka King lives up to his 

name. He dares pearl-clutching 
viewers, who might think that the 
cop-killing is too far, to leave their 
judgment at the door. None of us were 
there. To wince at the use of violence 
by the Party because of our modern 
ideas about gun control would make it 
about us and not the story. This film is 
about as close as we can get to looking 
back in time, and as Hampton says in 
the film, “It’s not a question of violence 
or no violence, it’s a question of 
resistance to fascism or nonexistence 
within fascism.”

The filmmakers should get ready 

for a whirlwind of press. Whenever 
we have a new “Selma” or “12 Years 
a Slave,” white critics come out of the 
woodwork to bemoan how timely the 
film is, how deftly it holds a mirror 
to society — and it does. But these 
movies are always timely. If you 
really want us to stop thinking you’re 
racist, just give Kaluuya the Oscar he 
deserves.

‘Sergeant Salinger:’ A masterful reimagining 

of the author’s secret life during WWII 

“What really knocks me out is a 

book that, when you’re all done reading 
it, you wish the author that wrote it was 
a terrific friend of yours and you could 
call him up on the phone whenever 
you felt like it. That doesn’t happen 
much, though.” — J.D. Salinger, “The 
Catcher in the Rye,” 1951

“The Catcher in the Rye” is an 

ode to angst through the hilarious 
musings and reflections of Holden 
Caulfield. Reading it is a teenage rite 
of passage, and the novel’s themes of 
innocence, identity and loss remain 
with many long after their adolescent 
years have passed. Though everyone 
who 
reads 
it 
feels 
intimately 

acquainted with Holden, few know 
anything about his creator, author 
and notorious recluse J. D. Salinger. 

In his latest book “Sergeant 

Salinger,” 
Jerome 
Charyn, 
a 

prolific author of historical fiction, 
reimagines Salinger’s early life in 
kodachrome detail. Charyn follows 
Salinger’s path from his parents’ 
apartment on Park Avenue to the 
battlefields 
of 
Normandy 
and 

beyond, ending in the Tarrytown, 
N.Y. loft where much of “The 
Catcher in the Rye” was written. 
Grounded in biological fact and 
topped with a generous helping 
of imagination, Charyn’s novel 
wonderfully recreates the war years 
of J. D. Salinger. 

Charyn sets the scene in 1942 

New York, populating it with vibrant 
characters and period-correct lingo. 
The opening sequence, featuring 
an acerbic Walter Winchell (the 
famed New York gossip columnist) 
and the “voluptu-u-u-u-os” Oona 
O’Neill, is an intriguing, dramatic 
accomplishment. 
Here 
we 
are 

introduced to a young J. D. Salinger, 

“A tall yid, with big ears and olive 
skin and a Gypsy’s dark eyes.” As an 
upcoming young writer, Salinger’s 
short stories published in the “slicks” 
— magazines like The Saturday 
Evening Post and The New Yorker — 
had already accumulated a measure 
of fame. Charyn acquaints the reader 
to Salinger’s life in New York only to 
rip them away with the arrival of a 
draft letter.

Trained within the shadowy 

Counter Intelligence Corps, the 
sensitive Salinger is molded into a 
ruthless interrogator. The author 
follows Salinger, cast as a reluctant 
soldier but an excellent survivor, 
through many of the most notorious 
campaigns of World War II. From the 
beaches of D-Day to occupied Paris, 
he encounters prominent historical 
figures, including Brigadier General 
Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and Ernest 
Hemingway. 

He experiences the terror of the 

Hürtgen Forest “where toes froze 
off” and the nauseating liberation 
of a Bavarian death camp “where 
corpses were piled like cordwood.” 
Inexorably scarred by the “stench, 
the crippling acid smell of rotting 
flesh,” a haunted Salinger drifts 
dreamlike through the rest of the 
war. Though Salinger’s lucidity 
returns when necessary, his mental 
deterioration by the end of the war 
is alarming. 

As only the finest protagonists 

are, 
Charyn’s 
Salinger 
is 

wonderfully conflicted. Expertly 
drawing out Salinger’s struggle, 
Charyn demonstrates the dual 
nature of a young soldier caught 
between his humanity and his 
survival. At once a killer and savior 
of children, Salinger performs 
admirably throughout the war. 
Able to discern forgeries and sniff 
out lies with the ease of a priest at 
confession, Salinger struck fear 

into the hearts of the Germans 
and French Nazi collaborators. 
Even as he became known for his 
ruthlessness as an interrogator, 
he showered refugees with GI 
cigarettes and Hershey bars.

Rich 
with 
neither 
narrative 

nor scenery, “Sergeant Salinger” 
succeeds largely through the strength 
of its dialogue. Salinger’s steady voice 
guides the many dialogue-heavy 
scenes, evident especially during his 
interrogations of suspected Nazis. 
It’s a fast read and a blur of a story 
toward the end, as Salinger’s mental 
state fragments. The prose is fairly 
minimalist, with adjectives picked 
and placed sparingly. 

Often, the novel reads like a tribute 

to the literary lions of Charyn’s own 
youth including Hemingway, Kafka, 
Fitzgerald and, of course, Salinger 
(Jerome Charyn is 83 years old). At 
times, Charyn cannot resist throwing 
in a reference; “He also admired the 
lushness of Fitzgerald—Gatsby was 
his favorite book.” 

One of Salinger’s most famous 

short stories, “A Perfect Day for 
Bananafish,” is alluded to when 
Salinger asks his sister, “Doris, do 
you remember the bananafish?”, 
after which she promptly questioned 
his sanity. Charyn clearly draws 
inspiration 
from 
writer 
Kurt 

Vonnegut; 
“Sergeant 
Salinger” 

resembles 
a 
more 
coherent 

“Slaughterhouse-Five.”

Charyn’s 
ability 
to 
create 

dynamic characters is his other 
great success. Bold in the way only 
an older writer can be, Charyn 
writes Hemingway in as a character. 
Though 
Charyn’s 
Hemingway 

is slightly exaggerated, many of 
his mannerisms seem perfectly 
emulated. From their first meeting 
in 
the 
celebrity-dappled 
Stork 

Club to their reunion in war-torn 
Nuremberg, Salinger’s interactions 

with Hemingway are audacious 
and memorable. Other characters, 
such as Salinger’s sister, Doris, are 
complex and fully realized — she 
even narrates one of the last chapters 
during his return to New York as 
he struggles to readapt to civilian 
life. From rabid SS commandos to 
charismatic American lieutenants, 
Charyn’s characters are capable of 
inspiring both palpable loathing and 
starry admiration. 

If you’re looking for a classic 

combat novel, “Sergeant Salinger” 
may miss the mark. Yet, if you are 
looking for a more nuanced war 
novel, a story of World War II and 
what it did to the young men forced to 
fight it, this is the book for you. 

Salinger entered the war with 

a youth’s vitality and emerged 
warped, his conscience twisted 
irrevocably by the futility and 
suffering he witnessed. Despite 
some chronological irregularities, 
the novel skillfully blends fact 
and fiction. Charyn writes the 
war 
through 
a 
surreal 
lens, 

mimicking the experience of scores 
of disillusioned young soldiers, 
Salinger included. This is perhaps 
one of Charyn’s broader points — 
that the absurdity and trauma of 
WWII eclipse even the wildest 
fantasies of any writer. It doesn’t 
matter whether everything in the 
book is factually true: Salinger’s real 
war experience could hardly have 
been less extraordinary. 

Far more than a biopic of the 

enigmatic man who began writing 
of Holden Caulfield during scattered 
moments in bunkers and foxholes, 
“Sergeant Salinger” is an homage to 
what might have been and possibly 
was. Though we’ll never know all 
the true details of Salinger’s life, 
contenting ourselves with Jerome 
Charyn’s masterful reimagining will 
have to do.

No strings attached: Sphinx 
Virtuosi’s ‘This is America’

Orchestral music has always felt 

like a commitment. Listening to 
Mozart, Bach or Brahms is not for 
enjoyment, but rather a more serious 
soundtrack for getting my work done 
(without wasting an hour dancing 
to Megan Thee Stallion). Maybe it’s 
the lack of lyrics or the high-brow 
nature of classical music, but Western 
string instruments never gave me the 
excitement I crave in music.

But, what if orchestras were more 

than the sum of their boring parts? 
What if orchestras could create music 
that engaged an audience rather than 
lull me to sleep? 

Chamber orchestras around the 

world have tried their best to capture 
the height of human emotion by quite 
literally rubbing strings together, yet 
few have caught my heart. Classical 
music has had one foot in the grave 
ever since Lady Gaga’s “Chromatica,” 
but that doesn’t mean orchestras are 
six feet under just yet. 

Sphinx Virtuosi is a perfect 

example of that, breathing life into 
their orchestra with new work from 
underrepresented voices in music. As 

a Detroit-based, not-for-profit social 
justice organization, Sphinx uses 
the arts to uplift underrepresented 
musicians 
through 
education, 

leadership and performance. Each 
pillar of their mission is seen through 
one of Sphinx’s professional chamber 
orchestras, Sphinx Virtuosi.

With an orchestra of Black and 

Latinx musicians, Sphinx Virtuosi’s 
program “This is America” was free 
to the public with truly no strings 
attached.

“This is America” is a six-

piece presentation that highlights 
the work of Black and Latinx 
composers. The program clocked 
in at barely over an hour making 
it feel more like listening to your 
favorite no-skip album and less like 
a marathon. With recent trends 
showing less than five percent 
of orchestral musicians as being 
Black or Latinx, organizations like 
Sphinx Virtuosi are crucial spaces 
for 
underrepresented 
identities 

in orchestral music. Providing 
performances ranging from solo 
commissions to lively, full-length 
orchestra recordings, each of the 
program’s songs pack a punch and 
provide a worthy introduction to the 
stunning talent of Sphinx Virtuosi.

A highlight of the “This is America” 

performance came toward the end 
with Sphinx Virtuosi’s performance 
of “Delights and Dances” by Michael 
Abels. The dissonant joy of the piece 
was exemplified through the quartet’s 
viola performance by Celia Hatton. 
Hatton’s performance was rich, 
robust and personified the heightened 
emotional presence of a prima donna 
singing their heart out.

In a killer ensemble, Hatton’s phrasing 

was matched by the fellow members of 
her quartet — Rainel Joubert (Violin I), 
Melissa White (Violin II) and Thomas 
Mesa (Cello) — with each member 
offering a wavering pull into the handoff 
of every phrase of the song. Together, the 
piece captured the wonderful ebb and 
flow of bittersweet joy that comes with 
Abel’s work. You might have heard his 
music before in “Get Out” or “Us.” Abel 
is known for working in the more eerie 
sectors of music. Yet, this piece felt like a 
requiem of hope for the history of Black 
music in America.

Although most programs and 

live events have struggled to keep 
up during COVID-19 times, Sphinx 
Virtuosi, with the help of Four/Ten 
Media, was able to create a more 
engaging chamber orchestra than 
that of their predecessors. 

Using individual recordings of each 

musician, Four/Ten Media created an 
inventive visual collage of musicians 
performing each piece. The visual 
collection of members recording 
their part shifted throughout each 
performance, focusing on fast runs of 
the violins one moment and the deep 
plucks of the double bass the next. 

This virtual enhancement allowed 

me to observe each musician working 
at their craft and appreciate the tactical 
ability that comes from being a virtuoso 
by the likes of Nicki Minaj or Taylor 

Swift. Although at times the virtual 
setting was punctuated by hearing the 
musicians breathe, in a way, it made 
me feel as though I was breathing 
with them through each phrase in the 
music. 

So, maybe not all orchestras are 

that boring. Sphinx has simply cut 
inequitable ties that have persisted 
in the orchestral field and the music 
industry as a whole. Sphinx has no 
strings attached and no, I’m not just 
saying that because it’s a bit of fun 
wordplay, but because they aren’t 

trying to tie their audience down in 
the details. 

Sphinx Virtuosi is no strings 

attached because they offer up “This 
is America” as a free experience to 
uplift Black and Latinx musicians for 
communities who usually don’t have 
access. 

No strings attached because 

the stories they tell are authentic 
and capture your heart. No strings 
attached because they let the 
musicians speak for themselves — 
and it is magnetic.

There’s nothing more beautiful 

than seeing a friendship blossom 
between two women in a powerful 
pact, especially when the characters 
are entirely different. It embodies a 
connection in which we all dream of 
experiencing in our lives. Hollywood 
has done an amazing job with its 
representation of female friendships 
in television from characters like Issa 
and Molly in “Insecure” to Blaire and 
Serena of “Gossip Girl.” Although 
these relationships may sometimes 
seem to focus on superficial aspects, 
the 
focus 
on 
positive 
female 

friendships is so important for young 
and female-identifying viewers. 

Based on the novel by Kristin 

Hannah, “Firefly Lane” is one of 
the most accurate representations 
of 
female 
friendship 
witnessed 

on-screen. It isn’t as powerful as “The 
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,” but 
there’s something lovable about this 
series that keeps you glued to the TV 
as it dives deeper into the history of the 
two main characters. 

Tully 
Hart 
(Katherine 
Heigl, 

“Suits”), the daughter of a drug-
dependent hipster mom with a troubled 
past, moves to Firefly Lane where 
she meets her next-door neighbor, 
Kate Mularkey (Sarah Chalke, “Rick 
and Morty”). Kate, although nerdy 
and quirky to the extreme, captivates 
Tully, and they eventually become the 
best of friends. The series explores the 
friendship between Tully and Kate 
from youth into adulthood, portraying 
the finer and not-so-fine things in life. 

Maggie Friedman, the show’s 

creator, skillfully portrays both the 
positive and negative aspects of 
female friendships. Think of it as 
the “Woman’s Saga.” It explores 
everything from happiness to anger, 
jealousy and life’s growing pains. 

While the show is set up to 

encourage viewers to root for either 
character in their personal storylines, 
it still portrays how codependency 
can take shape in friendships. It 
illustrates 
what 
happens 
when 

two friends are so invested in their 
friendship with one another, they 
begin to ignore their own personal 
problems or, even worse, ignore the 
ill-treatment of one party all for the 
purpose of having a friend. We get 
insight into an unspoken tension that 
lies closely beneath the surface. So 
close that in every new episode, you 
expect it to eventually blow up in 
their face. 

The series doesn’t shy away 

from the difficult issues that girls 
go through. It feels authentic and 
familiar, which is what these types 
of television shows need. It’s what 
one would call a “Bildungsroman,” 
illustrating how the main characters 
rely on one another for moral growth. 
They ultimately begin to learn more 
about themselves, albeit at different 
paces. “Firefly Lane” is a positive 
representation of friendship in its 
entirety. The life of a friendship 
is capable of sustaining longevity 
through an understanding of self and 
the situation, through thick and thin. 

This show is for the softies. It 

makes me want to call up my best 
girlfriends for a night out or a Friday 
night slumber party. Everyone needs 
a best friend simply to share thoughts, 
feelings and triumphs that they can 
relate to one another with. That 
emotional support develops a strong 
bond that is extremely hard to break, 
and life could be really detrimental 
without it. 

But what happens when one 

party crosses the line? Granted, no 
friendship is perfect. But that doesn’t 
mean differences that occur in a 
friendship gives the right to end it. 
Things happen. Life happens. But 
friendship is forever. 

‘Firefly Lane’ proves that 

friendship is forever

“You can murder a liberator, but 

you can’t murder a liberation.” - Fred 
Hampton. 

 On Friday, Feb. 12, the long-

awaited biopic, “Judas and the Black 
Messiah,” will be released. The film 
is a historical portrayal of the Illinois 
chapter of the Black Panther Party 
for Self-Defense. The Black Panther 
Party 
championed 
countless 

community programs, including 
the Free Breakfast Program and the 
People’s Free Ambulance Service, as 
well as a constant pursuit of adequate 
health care, education, housing 
and self-determination. Led by 
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton, 
the Illinois chapter, like many of 
its nation-wide counterparts, was 
a militant body of revolutionaries 
challenging the global institutions 
of 
capitalism, 
imperialism 
and 

fascism –– oppressive mediums 
inextricably 
bound 
to 
racism. 

Hampton was primed for his 
position as a leader throughout 
his youth. Having observed the 
eloquence of intellectuals and the 
inspired oration of Malcolm X, he 
was profoundly aware that he had 
been called on to serve The People, 
and while a student at Triton Junior 
College, he founded the Illinois 
chapter of the Black Panther Party. 

Tasked with embodying such 

poise, actor Daniel Kaluuya does 
Chairman Fred Hampton’s integrity 
justice and the rest of us a service 
with his captivating performance. 
Writer and director Shaka King 
remarks, “When we sat down 
together, 
(Kaluuya) 
had 
some 

qualities, as a person, that I’ve heard 
a lot of people use to describe Fred. 
A real sense of maturity, a gravitas, 
a power of presence, (… ) —a wit, a 
cleverness. ( . . . ) And Fred possessed 
that as well.” 

The film depicts the life and love 

of the Illinois chapter, as well as 
the internal conflict of 17-year-old 
William O’Neal, played by LaKeith 
Stanfield. O’Neal is obligated to both 
the BPP and the government’s will, 
having been planted into the ranks 
of the Illinois chapter by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation to infiltrate 
the Black Panther Party and surveil 
Hampton –– one of FBI director J. 
Edgar Hoover’s so-called “Black 
Messiahs.” 

The Saturday before the movie’s 

release, Daniel Kaluuya, LaKeith 
Stanfield, 
Dominique 
Fishback 

(portraying 
Deborah 
Johnson), 

Dominique Thorne (Judy Harmon), 
Algee Smith (Jake Winters) and 
Darrell Britt-Gibson (Bobby Rush) 
sat down with the Michigan in 
Color section of The Michigan Daily 
to discuss the film. These actors 
embody the quintessential theme of 
both the film and the Black Panther 
Party –– the manifold nature of 
Revolution. In speaking to them, it 
became apparent that the film was 
emblematic of three realizations 
of 
Revolution: 
Womanhood 
as 

Revolution, Serving the People as 
Revolution and ultimately, Love as 
Revolution. 

“Women create worlds and we 

create lives. And how revolutionary 
is it to create love and to create 
life and surrender it to the world? 
That’s extremely radical. And so on 
a basic level, women are and always 
(have) 
been 
revolutionary 
and 

radical,” Fishback told The Daily. 
And at the forefront of history, at 
the forefront of scholarship, at the 
forefront of the Black Panther Party 
and at the forefront of this film are 
Black women. The biopic offers us 
two female forces: non-fictional 
writer and activist Johnson (now 
known as Mama Akua Njeri) and 
fictional Judy Harmon, the chapter’s 
security captain meant to represent 
unyielding Black women and their 
supreme discipline. Johnson is a 
constant pillar of love, support, trust 
and humanity.

In the Warner Bros. production 

notes, shared with The Daily, 
Shaka King embraces Johnson — 
Hampton’s fiancée — as Hampton’s 
intellectual equal and vessel to 
render him, “from superhuman to 
human(…) In getting to know her, 
he becomes the People. In turn, she 
becomes a Revolutionary.” Johnson 
challenges Hampton’s leadership, 

encouraging him to step down and 
stand with the People and to exist 
with the People, who in turn, he 
becomes. Fishback and her character 
Johnson alike are representations 
of unapologetic truth and a clarity 
of purpose. They guide the path 
to seeing liberation through. In an 
interview with The Daily, Thorne, 
playing Harmon, articulates the 
Revolutionary force of women within 
the film with pristine eloquence: 
“There’s a reason why Judy Harmon 
was in that room. There’s a reason 
why Deborah Johnson was in those 
rooms, there is a very clear reason 
why, and hopefully you see that in 
the action that they take and in the 
way that they speak to each other. It 
was about telling the truth, honestly, 
because that has been the legacy of 

Black women since the beginning 
of time.”

Hampton’s speeches are central 

to the film, which parallel his 
reverence for oration in real life; 
central to these speeches are always 
the People to whom he is speaking. 
When asked what he hoped people 
would take away from the film, 
Kaluuya told The Daily that he 

wants the movie to represent what 
“the Black Panther Party(…) stood 
for. They fed kids with the breakfast 
program, they educated kids, they 
covered Legal Aid, they organized 
buses in order for people who had 
family members in prison(…) to go 
and visit them; they really poured 
love within their own community. 
And the earnest narrative of them 
being a terrorist organization was 
rooted in white fear of Black life.”

Hampton 
was 
a 
vessel 
for 

defending, protecting and upholding 
the People first and foremost; 
the BPP nurtured the People and 
provided them with the material 
and 
intellectual 
resources 
for 

optimal 
progression 
toward 

personal and community goals. 
The production notes also quote 

Dominique Fishback speaking to 
the power of the Black Panther 
Party and respective intellectual 
enlightenment: “To learn about 
the Black Panther Party is to learn 
how to be at the helm of your own 
investigational studies and also 
guided by your own intuition. A deep 
knowing of truth.” Just as the true 
players of history lived each moment 
pursuing their deepest knowing of 
truth, the actors that created this 
film did so as an act of servitude to 
the People, for the sake of informing 
and providing resources through 
which one may expand limitlessly. 

Poetry is ever-present in the 

film as a mechanism for depicting 
both the Black Panthers’ inherent 
poetic nature and the understanding 
of revolution as existing within 
creation. And this poetry, for which 
Johnson is a vessel, is the ultimate 
representation of revolutionary love. 
Upon Hampton and Johnson’s first 
meeting, she remarks to him, “Just so 
you know, you are a poet.” Hampton 
eventually 
begins 
to 
embrace 

Johnson’s ideology –– that being 
radical is more than inspired action; 
it is loving, building, caring and 
learning. Fishback herself echoes the 
sentiment that embodying profound 
love takes shape in a multitude of 
ways, positing to The Daily, “We 
think that revolutionaries are only 
gun carrying and speaking out on 
platforms, but we see the levels. We 
have Dominique Thorne, who plays 
Judy Harmon; she has the gun, and 
she’s on a security team. And then 
we have my character, navigating 
the whole world, what women do.”

Love as told through poetry is 

Johnson’s radical nature, and in this, 
she recognizes that love within and 
for family is inherently antithetical 
to any system existing to isolate, 
separate and oppress. Fishback, who 
told The Daily she is a poet herself, 
said she wrote inspired poetry 
specifically for the film. In the film, 
Johnson recites a deeply spiritual 
poem that portrays her greatest 
passions, joys and fears. In her poem, 

she reflects on her fear that she will 
never be radical enough for the man 
she loves –– that raising a family and 
putting her family first isn’t radical 
enough. Tears falling from her 
face, she looks up at Hampton and 
speaks of her realization that every 
characteristic of herself that she fears 
is not radical enough, is exactly what 
make her radical. Just as Hampton 
understands his purpose as one for 
the People, Deborah understands 
herself as not only a vessel for radical 
Love through her poetry, but a vessel 
for radical Love through the living 
being within her –– a culmination of 
the mutual love, care and respect at 
the foundation of their relationship.

This 
film 
was 
indubitably 

affecting in its representation of 
Black family, love and power, though 
it did not capture everything that 
Chairman Fred Hampton and the 
BPP’s anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist 
politic was. The Black Panther Party 
and the film’s events implore us to 
execute self-education, especially 
through reading, of information 
beyond the scope of pop culture 
or what is immediately available 
to us. Politics must be internalized 
for individual understanding, so 
that we may serve the People in 
the most interpersonally effective 
way feasible. We must create trust, 
first with ourselves and our own 
intellect, and then apply that to the 
world we interact with in the pursuit 
of servitude. Hampton himself 
proclaims, “not theory and theory 
alone, but theory and practice. The 
two go together. We not only thought 
about the Marxist-Leninist theory — 
we put it into practice. This is what 
the Black Panther Party is about.”

“We do not fight racism with racism. 

We fight racism with solidarity. We 
do not fight exploitative capitalism 
with Black capitalism. We fight 
capitalism with basic socialism. And 
we do not fight imperialism with more 
imperialism. We fight imperialism with 
proletarian internationalism.” - Black 
Panther Party Co-Founder Bobby Seale

“In speaking to (the cast of 

“Judas and the Black Messiah”), it 

became apparent that the film was 

emblematic of three realizations 

of Revolution: Womanhood as 

Revolution, Serving the People as 

Revolution and ultimately, Love as 

Revolution.”

At 
President 
Joe 
Biden’s 

inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021, 
22-year-old Amanda Gorman 
delivered an original poem, 
“The Hill We Climb.” The Los 
Angeles resident and Harvard 
College graduate made history 
as 
the 
youngest 
known 

inaugural 
poet, 
sparking 

admiration and conversation in 
the following weeks.

Her 
poem 
isn’t 
without 

criticism, however. Some people 
have taken to the comment 
sections in newspapers like 
The Hill to demean her values 
with matters of technicality. 
Check out Reddit’s r/Poetry 
subreddit, a place to share and 
discuss published poetry, and 
you’ll find similar sentiments. 
One user said, “The meter is all 
over the place. The wordplay 
is inane. It’s full of patriotic 
platitudes and contains nothing 
new or surprising. It wouldn’t 
inspire anyone at any time 
except Americans, today.”

So, I am inclined to ask, 

what makes a good poem? The 
structure? 
Its 
impact? 
I’ve 

heard various people commend 
the artist yet criticize the 
poem 
for 
things 
such 
as 

“clichés” 
and 
“frustrating 

meter.” 
Additionally, 
others 
 

have praised “The Hill We 
Climb” for its messages and 
pacing but question whether 
it 
is 
“technically 
strong.” 

Regardless, I think that there is 
great merit in the work as a piece 
of art. Art and creativity can be 
important tools for inspiring 
people, and Gorman utilized 
them to do just that. A Forbes 
article 
says, 
“Gorman 
has 

produced poetry and studied 
sociology, 
so 
in 
combining 

complex social science into an 
art form, she has developed a 
unique offering in both fields.” 
I’d have to agree.

Journalists, 
teachers 
and 

YouTubers alike have begun 
analyzing 
Gorman’s 
piece, 

noting 
references 
to 
the 

Bible and other poets’ work. 

Personally, I hear rhythms and 
repetitions that remind me of 
the musical “Hamilton.” There 
are two references to the musical 
within the poem, in addition to 
commentary on current events. 
The significance? Gorman is 
purposeful in her words and 
presentation. The accessibility 
of her piece, though indifferent 
to the poem’s technicality, is, 
bluntly put, incredible. There is 
still value that can be measured 
in the conciseness of words and 
density of thought within it, 
but the poem’s reach to general 
audiences should be considered 
invaluable. 
The 
feelings 
it 

evoked in countless people, 
even if only for a moment, 
have been monumental (just 
check 
out 
the 
positivity 

related to #AmandaGorman on 
Twitter). Gorman’s position as 
an inaugural poet gave her a 
platform to deliver a message 
in a moving way, reaching those 
who previously wouldn’t have 
given poetry a second thought. 
I think this is one area that 
she succeeds, not just in her 
poem, but in her empowering 
execution.

In her delivery, Gorman’s 

presence 
exudes 
strength, 

but her words also reflect 
pain. Poignant lines remind 
young Americans — not unlike 
Gorman — that our work is 
not done. We must strive for 
progress in a society that is 
fast-paced 
and 
continuously 

evolving. 
Accommodating 

changing times also means 
acknowledging the dark that 
remains. In doing so, and in 
the words of Gorman herself in 
“The Hill We Climb,” perhaps 
we might “raise this wounded 
world into a wondrous one.” 
What exactly does it mean “to 
forge a union with purpose?” 
Can love truly “become our 
legacy?” Will the poem that 
implores such affirmations be 
remembered and recited for 
years to come? I don’t know, but 
I don’t believe that its relevance 
to the present detracts from 
the message it has to tell. If 
anything, the call for light and 
unity is one that we needed.

In today’s day and age, it may 

seem as though taking no stance 
amidst the frenzy of American 
politics 
is 
the 
best 
route. 

Especially in a college setting 
such as our own, some of us think 
a surefire method of not making 
friends is to be vocal about our 
political stances — the last thing 
we want to do is alienate ourselves 
by potentially alienating a group of 
others. William O’Neal exhibited 
a 
similar 
mindset 
preceding 

his infiltration into the Black 
Panther Party (BPP) in the late 
1960s, as portrayed in the highly-

anticipated 
Shaka 
King 
film 

“Judas and the Black Messiah.” 
O’Neal, 
played 
by 
Lakeith 

Stanfield, sets to wave his own 
criminal record by informing the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation on 
the proceedings of one of the most 
influential Black revolutionaries 
of the 20th century — the BPP’s 
Chairman Fred Hampton played 
by Daniel Kaluuya. Though the 
film offers many lessons, one 
of its loudest is the eventual 
assured disintegration of apathy. 
What begins because of a sense 
of political indifference ends in 
the death of the Chairman by 
the hands of the United States 
government. What starts as no 
stance eventually teeters one 
way or the other, and in the case 
of O’Neale, slips too deep to the 
wrong end.

Throughout the unfortunate 

tragedy, the FBI wields O’Neal like 
a puppet, hanging his potential 
prison sentence over his head 
in an effort to keep him docile 
in his informancy. At one point, 
the agent working with O’Neal 

discusses his own thoughts on 
the Black Panther Party and 
likens them to the Ku Klux Klan, 
and O’Neal mumbles in neither 
agreement or disagreement — the 
neutrality persists. As the film 
progresses, the agent observes 
O’Neal at a rally during one of 
Chairman Hampton’s speeches, 
later remarking to him that it 
looked like he believed what the 
Chairman was saying. And here 
and there, it really did look so: 
O’Neal’s glass shield of apathy 
seems to chip as the crowd shouts 
in vigor “I am a revolutionary!” It 
makes sense why the American 
government would see Chairman 
Hampton as a threat: He wove 
together similarities in groups 
that would never have seen the 
commonality in their causes prior. 
With the Rainbow Coalition, 
Hampton created a multicultural 
coalition with the most unlikely 
participants at face value, the 
Young Patriots Organization. The 
film displays Chairman Hampton 
walking into their meeting, with 
him on one side and a group 

member speaking on the other, 
the Young Patriots Organization’s 
Confederate flag hanging proudly 
in the background. By the end 
of their discussion, members of 
the Young Patriot Organization 
realize the common goal that 
unites their interests with those 
of the BPP: minimizing and 
eventually ending poverty. In the 
same way, Chairman Hampton 
also joins forces with Young 
Lords, a predominantly Latinx 
based organization that, through 
his convincing, realize the same 
common 
goal. 
Following 
the 

creation of this organization, 
many of its subgroups advanced 
social programs like free breakfast 
programs, medical clinics and 
clothing drives. It seems as 
though the BPP isn’t as extreme 
as most media and historical 
recounts push us to perceive 
them as; it seems as though at 
the end of the day, their stances 
and programs were nowhere near 
extremist, 
rather 
increasingly 

applicable and greatly beneficial 
to a wide array of Americans from 

varying backgrounds. This may be 
why FBI director J. Edgar Hoover 
cited them as the country’s biggest 
threat — they, and as this film 
aptly displays, certainly Chairman 
Hampton, filled the void created 
by the American government in 
its disregard for and perpetuation 
of racial and economic injustice, 
by 
serving 
as 
the 
unifying, 

benefactory role that many would 
expect a just government to do.

But fear-mongering of the other 

unfortunately works too well, and 
combined with the FBI’s pressure 
on O’Neal, he undoubtedly was 
more of a pawn than a willful 
perpetrator. 
However, 
it’s 

important to note that O’Neil’s 
initially 
nonexistent 
stance 

became grossly misappropriated 
to serve another stance, a vested 
interest by the preservers of 
the status quo. Moreso, the film 
provides a contrast that may 
be even more telling — groups 
that 
initially 
solely 
looked 

inwards 
in 
their 
advocacy 

realized the inherent universal 
political deterrents of their own 

causes — realization spurred by 
conversation, debate and for lack 
of a better term, initially awkward 
encounters. While O’Neal ran 
from ascribing to any political 
or social movement, he actively 
worked against the interests of 
his own community; whereas 
Chairman Hampton unearthed 
commonalities in the pursuits of 
communities that, until that point, 
were others to one another. The 
real kicker to me? As I watched the 
film, picking up my phone every 
other second to research if that 
aspect they just mentioned was 
real or made up, I came across the 
ages of both O’Neal and Hampton 
at the time of these events. 20 
and 21, respectively. Any of us 
could be either of them right now: 
We could either be a vessel for 
vested interests that aren’t ours, 
or we can be an instrument to 
deliver long-awaited justice in a 
world that seems devoid of it. The 
decision we make incrementally 
becomes clearer and clearer based 
on the stances we take, or more 
significantly, don’t.

The Dangers of Political Apathy: Lessons from Judas and the Black Messiah

ELIYA IMTIAZ 
MiC Senior Editor

Every time I see a red envelope, 

I feel as though I’m entering a time 
machine. 

This red envelope is more 

than just paper. It’s filled with 
lucky money, given from adults to 
children during the Lunar New 
Year as a way to wish them health 
and a long life.

As I clean out my room and 

stumble upon a stack of my favorite 
red envelopes, I’m teleported 
through a catalog of memories 
I associate with the Lunar New 
Year. 

My first stop: Texas, circa 2009. 

I’m surrounded by many things: 
the humid air that makes my skin 
sticky; the sounds of firecrackers, 
which deafen me for a week; 
the sight of the dragon dancers 
that makes my back ache just by 
watching. The drums and cymbals 
grow louder and louder. Parents 
shoot Vietnamese profanities out 
of their mouths at their kids who 
won’t stop running around. My 
first stop is overwhelming. But at 
least I have a red envelope in hand.

The next place I visit is a temple 

in Warren, Mich. It’s 2010. The 
smell of the burnt firecrackers 

overtakes my nose, and I can no 
longer smell the glutinous sticky 
rice made by the temple nuns in 
the basement or the smell of the 
freshly peeled oranges that the 
monk handed out to everyone. 
I remember the happiness I felt 
every time we celebrated the New 
Year at temple because the most 
important thing to me was that 
I got to skip school the next day. 
And suddenly, before I know it, the 
clock reads 12:30 in the morning, 
my eyes droop and the voices 
around me gradually get quieter as 
I fall asleep on the temple floor. My 
second stop is pure childhood. I get 
money in a red envelope and get to 
skip school — what more could I 
want as a kid?

Stop three takes place in 2012 at 

an annual New Year’s celebration 
in Berkley, Mich. A huge group 
of us temple children nervously 
wait backstage as we get ready to 
perform. Jittery nerves, hearts 
wildly beating. Onstage, I begin to 
love it — the lights, the cheers, the 
all-eyes-on-us feeling. Everyone 
claps loudly and I spend the rest 
of the night running around in 
my áo dài that came straight from 
Vietnam, munching on the over-
toasted bánh mì that spreads a trail 
of crumbs behind me. My third 
stop is heartwarming. Everyone 

is having a good time with the red 
envelopes tucked deep into the 
pockets of their pants.

Next: California, 2018. I’m 

older now, so the feelings are 
much clearer — like the feeling of 
excitement I get catching the plane 
to California and heading straight 
from the hotel to a temple there. 
This temple is big. It’s bright. It’s 
one of the nicest I have ever seen. 
Large red paper lanterns and 
yellow flowers adorn the doors 
and walkways, making me feel like 
I’m somewhere straight out of a 
movie. We see someone my uncle 
knows, and she gives my sister and 
me a red envelope. Here, I feel at 
home. Surrounded by the smells of 
food sold at the stations and tasting 
the crispy egg rolls in my mouth, I 
feel like I’m in my kitchen at home 
eating all of my mom’s home-
cooked meals. My fourth stop 
gives me comfort. I’m blessed by 
the envelope and the opportunity 
for good food.

For the last stop, I’m back home 

and it’s 2020. It’s my family’s 
second year hosting a Vietnamese 
New Year’s celebration with all 
our family friends. The younger 
children painting, the older kids 
taking photos or playing video 
games in my room, the moms 
singing the night away with 
every karaoke song they know by 
heart and the dads drinking and 
discussing whatever dads like to 
discuss. At around 11 p.m., the 

dads sit along the couches and we 
children go down the line, wishing 
them a happy new year, health 
and happiness in exchange for 
these little red envelopes, holding 
in their clutches a $2 bill. This 
memory is loving. The interaction 
between giving and receiving is 
nothing short of pure warmth and 
tenderness in my heart.

Stepping 
out 
of 
the 
time 

machine, I feel full, though I begin 
to wonder: What is the Lunar 
New Year going to bring me this 
year? As Feb. 12 gets closer and 
closer, I realize how different 
the celebration will look with 
the pandemic looming over us. 
No more firecrackers and large 
celebrations in the main temple 
room where everyone sits knee-
to-knee, shoulder-to-shoulder. No 
more long lines of dads passing 
out money, or trips to California 
or Texas where I can still feel at 
home. 

Despite all these memories I 

associate with the Lunar New 
Year, which I will definitely miss 
this year and as long as COVID-19 
is around, I stay grounded in the 
fact that the one common theme 
among all these memories is my 
family. My family that makes me 
feel loved, makes me feel at home, 
makes me connected to who I 
am. So as long as I’m with them, 
the Lunar New Year will always 
be valuable. With them, and a red 
envelope.

Within seconds of watching 

the trailer of “Minari” last 
fall, my eyes were immediately 
filled with tears. I barely 
even knew the title of the 
movie or what kind of story 
it would tell, but I was so 
unshakably 
emotional. 
And, 

strangely enough, the same 
thing happened to many of 
my Korean-American friends. 
Looking back, I don’t think it 
was only because the movie 
seemed so well-written, or 
because it foreshadowed such 
moving 
performances 
from 

Han Ye-ri and Steven Yeun or 
that it looked so aesthetically 
beautiful. While “Minari” did 
turn out to be all those things 
and more, I realize I was 
so moved because it simply 
looked so … familiar. I could 
not help but cry in those first 
few moments because for the 
first time in my life, I could see 
myself on screen. 

Directed by Lee Isaac Chung 

and premiered at the Sundance 
Film Festival in January 2020, 
“Minari” tells the story of the 
“American Dream” and, more 
importantly, that of those who 
pursue it. Set in a small town 
in Arkansas in the 1980s, the 
storyline follows Jacob, Monica 
and their two children, Anne 
and David, as they move from 
California to rural Arkansas to 
start a family farm and begin 
a new life. Mostly taking place 
in a run-down, wooden trailer 
home, the movie portrays the 
hardship and fear that comes 
with raising a family in a 
foreign country, as well as the 
shifting — and endearingly 
entertaining, to say the least 
— family dynamic with the 
arrival of David’s grandma, 
played by the legendary Yoon 
Yuh-jung from Korea.

As a first-generation Korean 

American raised in the Chicago 
suburbs in the 2010s, I grew up 
almost thirty years after and 
halfway across the country 
from where this movie was set. 
Yet somehow, “Minari” still 
felt so personal to me. Whether 
it was hearing the perfectly 
broken Korean of David talking 
to his grandma or watching him 
witness his mother’s joy at the 
unbagging of gochugaru (red 
chili powder) from Korea, there 
were so many small details 
scattered throughout the film 
that are incredibly particular 
to 
the 
Korean-American 

experience that I grew up 
with. Watching the characters 
undergo 
an 
experience 
so 

similar to my own made me 
feel so exposed, and liberated, 
and vulnerable and seen — so 
much so that I couldn’t help but 
wonder in amazement if this is 
how many of my white friends 
feel every time they watch a 
mainstream American movie 
in theaters or how my parents 
feel whenever they watch an 
old Korean movie set in the era 
of their youth.

After having seen the movie 

twice (my family loved it so 

much 
that 
we 
re-watched 

it less than two days after 
the first time), I realized 
that, at its core, “Minari” is 
a gentle film. Layered with 
the 
beautiful 
instrumentals 

of Emile Mosseri’s dreamlike 
soundtrack and shots of young 
David walking alongside his 
grandma in his cowboy boots, 
it is a kind and honest film, 
warm beyond measure. But 
much more than that, it is a 
healing film. While watching 
the movie, I found myself 
strangely wondering — and 
admittedly 
even 
becoming 

slightly possessive over — to 
whom this film really belongs. 
Even within the immigrant 
narrative, I thought this movie 
was made for first-generation 
Korean Americans like me; 
it is finally our story being 
told, and through the eyes of a 
fellow first-generation director 
at that. But as I watched it 
the second time through and 
saw my mom laughing and 
crying alongside Monica who 
reunites with her own mother 
or bashfully tries to speak 
English at the family’s local 
church, it made me realize that 
my mother sees “Minari” as the 
telling of her story as much as I 
do my own. 

I 
think 
that 
for 
many 

Korean Americans, we have 
a long-ridden desire buried 
deep within us to be seen, 
and to have ownership over 
something, anything, that we 
can truly call ours. And this 
film is monumental in gently 
unraveling 
that 
insecurity. 

“Minari” allowed me to feel like 
it was mine, something I could 
proudly hold onto and cherish 
without a need for justification. 
But, 
in 
the 
same 
healing 

process, it also reminded me 
that the immigrant experience 
is inherently a paired journey 
between both generations, and 
it is difficult and nuanced and 
lonely on both ends. It made 
me realize that my parents are 
more than valid in feeling seen 
by this movie and that this film 
— and the story it tells — is as 
uniquely important and special 
to them as it is for me. And it 
taught me that maybe sharing 
this ownership of the Korean-
American experience is a very 
necessary and beautiful thing. 

Even without its genuinely 

hilarious 
scenes, 
adept 

storytelling 
and 
striking 

visuals, “Minari” carries so 
much significance in its own 
existence. After watching it, 
I didn’t really care if it felt 
slow at times or if someone’s 
acting 
wasn’t 
perfect. 
The 

fact 
remains 
that 
this 
is 

an American film about a 
Korean-American family and 
is something that is, and will 
always be, so deeply special 
to me and to many others. I 
think I speak for many Korean 
Americans when I say that 
“Minari” — and even director 
Lee Isaac Chung’s decision to 
create it — truly feels like a 
gift I didn’t know I and many 
others had waited so long to 
receive. So, thank you, Lee 
Isaac Chung, for “Minari.”

“Minari”: it dances, 
it glimmers, it heals

What is
digital 

studies?

BY ALEXANDER 

SATOLA, STATEMENT 

CORRESPONDENT

I

n January 2019, LSA announced the 
creation of a new Digital Studies In-
stitute that would support the study 

of digital technologies from a humanities and 
social science perspective. The establishment 
of a formal academic institute followed the cre-
ation of the LSA Digital Studies Program in 2014 
within the University’s Department of Ameri-
can Culture.

The DSI embraces an interdisciplinary ap-

proach, engaging different methodologies, 
frameworks and discourses from across a vari-
ety of academic fields. The particularity of DSI, 
however, lies in its singular focus on all things 
related to the phenomenon of digital technol-
ogy. “We are the nation’s first one-stop shop for 
all things digital,” claims the website’s “About” 
page, “including digital media studies, digital 
humanities, digital pedagogy, digital art, aes-
thetic practice and design, and critical thinking 
about our digital future.”

There is a question that remains unanswered, 

however, when we separate “the digital” from 
the more traditional concepts of the humanities, 
art and design: What are we studying when we 
study digital technology?

There are two immediate answers to this 

question. The first aims to explain what is dis-
tinctive about digital technology, namely its reli-
ance on binary numbers, Boolean logic and com-
puting. What differentiates digital from analog 
electronics is the capacity of digital electronics 
to process data in the form of digits, specifically 
zeroes and ones, and to display that information 
in a machine-readable format. Analog technol-
ogy, on the other hand, relies on representations 
or analogies of information collected through 
the continuous measurement of a natural signal, 
such as a sound wave.

The second answer to our question of what 

scholars of digital technology study, however, 
relates to examining the historical emergence 
of digital technologies and their impact on hu-
man affairs; to be sure, scholars in the DSI pro-
gram want to participate in the design of digital 
devices, but they also want to be more than just 
ethical consultants for engineers. With a vast 
field of inquiry in front of them, there are fresh 
opportunities to examine and understand the 
technologies that seem to pervade almost every 
aspect of our lives. What, then, is the role of this 
new discipline, and how does an organization 
like DSI push it forward?

***
Because digital studies cuts across so many 

academic disciplines, the minor in Digital Stud-
ies attracts students from the humanities, so-
cial sciences, physical and natural sciences and 
much more. With the growing salience of digital 
technology in the everyday lives of students, not 
to mention the general population, perhaps it 
was only a matter of time before the study of its 
relationship with art, society, ethics and politics 
became supported on an institutional level. 

To learn more about DSI on its own terms, I 

reached out to administrators, faculty and stu-
dents affiliated with it. My first conversation was 
with Lisa Nakamura, the director of the Digi-
tal Studies Institute and a Gwendolyn Calvert 
Baker Collegiate Professor in the Department of 
American Cultures. Nakamura, a scholar with a 
breadth of experience on issues of race in digital 
media, arrived at the University in 2012 to coor-
dinate what was then the Digital Studies Pro-
gram. Starting with the design of a curriculum, 
she noticed that many students were drawn to 
humanities and social sciences courses that ad-
dressed the role of digital technologies in society.

“We had courses for programmers already,” 

Nakamura told me during our Zoom call. “But 
they were applied courses, and these were more 
(about) understanding how the digital world 
works. You know, what everyday life is like on 
social media, or why is it that women don’t feel 
comfortable playing games that men might feel 
comfortable playing?”

To meet this student de-

mand, Nakamura assembled a 
“cheat sheet” of courses from 
a variety of departments, in-
cluding Communication & 
Media Studies, American Cul-
ture, English and the School of 
Information. The courses were 
targeted both to students with technical expe-
rience as well as other students from non-tech-
nical backgrounds. Soon, there were enough 
students taking these courses to warrant going 
to the curriculum committee to suggest the cre-
ation of a five-course minor in Digital Studies.

“So if we can offer a five-course minor, stu-

dents who have already done these things could 
at least get some credit for it; it could be visible 
on their resume,” Nakamura said. “So an English 
student or an Art History student could say to a 
parent who’s nagging them about ‘well what are 
you gonna do with this degree’ and show them, 
‘well, I’m taking a minor in digital studies.’ And 
we made the argument that it would help stu-
dents show expertise and be more employable.”

According to Nakamura, big companies like 

Oracle, Amazon and Microsoft have indeed hired 
students with the minor for their expertise on 
digital culture and issues of representation in 
digital media. It is not hard to see why; in recent 
years the shiny veneer of the tech industry has 
given way to a somewhat more complicated im-
age. A recent article from the Pew Research Cen-
ter summarizing current public opinion studies 
claimed that 64% of Americans believed that 
“social media have a mostly negative effect on the 
way things are going in the country today.” There 
have been numerous influential books published 
on the impact of algorithms on income inequality, 
as well as the pernicious role of digital technology 
in perpetuating racial discrimination. Largely due 
to this shift of public awareness, tech companies 
have come under increasing scrutiny for their im-
pacts on conflicts of class, race and gender, as well 
as their role in spreading misinformation and 
normalizing hate speech online.

While the minor in Digital Studies is de-

signed to look good on a resume, in the midst of 
this recent shift DSI also promises something 
else to its students. Throughout the curriculum, 
there is a focus on fostering a critical approach 
towards new technologies.

What is criticism, though and why is it neces-

sary to critique technology? First, it is essential to 
note the vocabulary of critique that professors in 
the humanities and social sciences employ. Cri-
tique is not the same as criticism, the latter mean-
ing the negative judgment of something. There is 
a relationship between the two words, however: 
Critique, in the sense of systematic examination 
or analysis, can help us arrive at better-informed 
judgments. The corollary of the critical attitude 
is the evasion of dogmatism, which is the unin-
formed acceptance of an idea. The 18th-century 
philosopher Immanuel Kant was instrumental 
in working out the foundations of modern criti-
cism and rejection of dogmatism, having written 
three major critiques in his lifetime. In his short 
essay “What is Enlightenment,” he implores his 
readers, “Sapere Aude! (Dare to know!) ‘Have 
the courage to use your own reason’ — that is the 
motto of enlightenment.”

The critique of technology, however, can be 

particularly frustrating because of the extreme 
positions taken either in support of or against 
it. Technophiles are especially dogmatic in their 
defense of permitting new technological inno-
vations in the name of freedom, no matter the 
social cost. Conversely, technophobic, modern-
day Luddites are no less dogmatic in their de-
nunciation of technology, advocating radical 
reconstruction of the existing means of trans-
portation, communication and distribution of 
technologies in society.

Between these two extremes, there is a mid-

dle ground which neither categorically fetishiz-
es nor denounces technological innovations. 

It seems to me that this is the kind of attitude 
found at DSI.

Marisa Olson, the executive coordinator of 

DSI, said she joined the Institute out of admi-
ration for the kind of critical work the students 
and faculty are pursuing. Olson worked with a 
number of other organizations investigating the 
relationship between technology and culture 
before arriving at the University, though she af-
firmed the unique approach she thinks the In-
stitute brings to the table.

“There’s fun stuff like playing video games 

and the things that Lisa (Nakamura) is talking 
about,” Olson said during our Zoom call. “But a 
lot of it is really specifically thinking about tech-
nology in relation to race, gender, disability class 
and access. That’s really our primary focus.”

Turning to a real-world application, Olson ex-

plained how the awareness of multiple approach-
es to the implementation of technology might 
help students make a positive impact throughout 
their careers. “The world tends to think about 
technology as a straight thing, even in relation 
to disability,” Olson said. “People might say, ‘let’s 
make this great technical object that’s going to 
really help disabled people’ and they don’t really 
know what they’re talking about.” 

Technological solutionism, a term coined by 

the philosopher Evgeny Morozov, describes this 
tendency of well-intentioned technical profes-
sionals to place their full faith in tech, thus ignor-
ing the perspectives of the people they are try-
ing to help. More than due diligence, interacting 
with communities on the ground is an effective 
means of ensuring that a proposed “solution” 
will not create new problems of its own. When 
dealing with humans, as much as with technol-
ogy, appreciating the nuances is key.

As an artist who creates work exploring the 

impact of digital technology on society, Olson 
often encounters an oversimplified, binary ap-
proach to judging the digital world. 

“A lot of my artwork is about technology’s 

impact on the environment,” Olson explained. 
“And I would say, you know, we may have new 
tools now to combat climate change like elec-
tric vehicles. But some of that is because of what 
technology already did to the environment. 
We may now have new ways to protest things, 
but we may be protesting things that were also 
caused by technology, so it’s a kind of a cyclical 
sort of situation.”

At this point, it is clear that, in typical human-

ities fashion, members of our community who 
affiliate themselves with DSI are interested in 
critiquing actually-existing technology. Nothing 
is safe from examination under the microscope 
of the Institute’s various instruments of investi-
gation, synthesis and analysis; not even itself.

***
When the critical lens is suddenly turned 

onto the critical theorists, there begins a mo-
ment of sobering reflection. The mission of the 
Digital Studies Institute is to connect a broad 
coalition of scholars and practitioners to study 
the relationship between technology and cul-
ture, but to what extent is this merely an orga-
nizational myth? DSI, after all, exists within the 
economic and bureaucratic constraints of the 
university. How can we understand its forma-
tion within this institutional context?

The recent creation of DSI fits into a longer 

historical trend of centers, programs and insti-
tutes. Especially among large public research 
universities, such as the University of Michigan, 
the University of California, Berkeley and the 
University of California, Los Angeles, and elite 
private universities such as Harvard University 

and Stanford University, the 1960s and 1970s 
saw a rise in funding for specialized centers, 
programs and institutes associated with the ex-
plosive growth of university enrollment in the 
post-War era.

Somewhat ironically, most of the research on 

centers and institutes as a new organizational 
form has come from the relatively new, inter-
disciplinary field of organizational studies, now 
offered as an undergraduate major at the Uni-
versity. In 1972, the American academic Stanley 
Ikenberry published “Beyond Academic Depart-
ments: The Story of Institutions and Centers,” in 
which he recounts the results of an extensive sur-
vey on the origins, structure, functions and issues 
surrounding institutions and centers. These new 
kinds of academic institutions formed, accord-
ing to Ikenberry’s account, to conduct research 
on specific social problems and thus to carve out 
sub-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary niches for 
their graduate students and faculty.

Central to the story of institutions and cen-

ters is the friction between these organizations 
and traditional academic departments. The 
perception that institutes and centers are “cash 
cows” that drain funding from academic depart-
ments became widespread in their period of 
early growth. Additionally, Ikenberry recounts 
the frustrations of some faculty and administra-
tors who believed the university was too eagerly 
“trying to be all things to all people,” indicating a 
general misalignment of the mission of the uni-
versity and the various aims of its institutes and 
departments.

Similarly, Jerry Stahler and William Tash, 

in their 1994 paper, describe different types of 
institutes in the modern university, contrasting 
“paper institutions” that have no staff, no budget 
and only exist in the minds of their members 
to these new well-funded monolithic research 
institutes. Especially among the more influen-
tial institutes, conflict and institutional gridlock 
can arise when institutes compete with depart-
ments for faculty time, internal funding support, 
research infrastructures like laboratories and 
spaces and prestige.

How does DSI fit within these organiza-

tional frameworks? First, it is important to note 
that DSI receives all of its funding from internal 
sources; however, that does not mean it will not 
apply for grants in the future. Second, the central 
justifications for the creation of DSI are its inter-
disciplinary and flexible nature. It is an institute 
that primarily serves undergraduates, graduate 
students and faculty in their pursuit of research 
pertaining to the digital world — research that 
is almost certainly going to involve some level 
of collaboration across disciplines. Third, DSI 
is still quite small, so it is likely not yet drawing 
money away from other similar programs, nor 
will it necessarily need to in order to grow.

When I thought about what other programs 

might be in competition with DSI, however, the 
University’s Science, Technology and Society 
Program immediately came to mind. Like DSI, 
the STS program offers an undergraduate minor 
and a graduate certificate to students who com-
plete the requisite courses. STS holds events on 
topics of interest in the field and supports its 
graduate students through workshops, reading 
groups and small grants. On the level of meth-
odology and approach, both programs teach 
students a number of critical frameworks and 
methods to examine the interactions between 
technology, science, biology and human society.

M

y sister and I were born one 
minute apart. Whenever I 
tell people this, questions 

inevitably follow: “What’s it like having 
a twin?” “Are you best friends?” “Can 
you read each other’s minds?” 

Over the years, I’ve formed a sort of 

automatic response: I laugh, acknowl-
edging the curiosity surrounding a con-
cept that is foreign and fascinating to 
someone else yet normal and casual to 
me. I then reply with a simple yet in-
tentionally worded, “Yeah, it’s fun. But 
I don’t know any different, so I have 
nothing to compare it to,” which is true. 
Having a twin sister is fun, and we’re the 
only kids in our family, so I don’t know 
what it’s like to have a non-twin sibling. 
But my answer isn’t the whole truth. My 
“nothing to compare it to” line is a buf-
fer, a cop-out from having to explain to 
another person, or admit to myself, the 
tough side of being a twin. 

Gracie and I have been compared to 

each other our entire lives. Who’s older? 
Lilly. Who talked first? Gracie. Taller? 
Gracie, until a few years ago. More logi-
cal? Absolutely Gracie. More organized? 
Lilly. Kinder, gentler, more thoughtful? 
Gracie. Funnier? Definitely, 100% Lilly.

I compare myself to Gracie, too. I 

think there’s an inevitable tension be-
tween all siblings, twins or not, that 
stems from being constantly compared 
to one another. Older siblings carry the 
weight of setting precedents and do-
ing most things first, all eyes on them. I 
know younger siblings who struggle in 
the shadows of their older ones, feeling 
like they need to keep up with, or even 
one-up, them. Perhaps the unique com-
parison of twins stems from the fact that 
differences cannot be blamed on any 
gap between exit times out of the womb. 

In fourth grade, our dad sat with Gra-

cie and me at the kitchen table helping 
us with our multiplication problems. 
Gracie knew the answers before my dad 
finished reading the question, while 
I sat in the chair across from her con-
fused, finishing out the session in tears. 
My mom intervened post-math home-
work tantrum. 

“What Gracie’s doing or how she’s 

doing it has no effect on you. Just focus 
on yourself. You’re driving your own car. 
In your own lane,” she told me. “Stay in 
your own lane.”

As I grew up beside Gracie, my mom’s 

advice continuously resurfaced. I was 
an anxious and emotional girl, ner-
vous and concerned by way too many 
things around me. I sobbed my entire 
first summer at overnight camp due to 
unmatched levels of homesickness. In 

school, I forced myself to do well, gluing 
myself to my desk chair until I mastered 
the material without fail. I panicked at 
the unknown. I’d pass out every now and 
again, too, due to vasovagal syndrome — 
wherein random triggers, like needles, 
cause blood pressure to plummet. Sim-
ply put, I was a hot mess. Gracie, on the 
other hand, was cool as a cucumber. She 
never seemed to flinch. She was rid-
ing down the highway on auto-pilot, as 
if wearing Chanel shades in a pristine 
Lamborghini. I, on the other hand, sput-
tered down the road in a peeling truck, 
beads of sweat constantly dripping 
down my forehead, hands clammy from 
the pressure. It didn’t seem fair. 

“Stay in your own lane,” my mom said. 
I did my best to keep my eyes on the 

horizon, but I couldn’t keep them from 
wandering. In high school, Gracie had 
her entire life trajectory planned out. 
She was going to study film in college 
and afterward move to California to be a 
screenwriter. She then perfectly imple-
mented her plan of action. Gracie took 
film class upon film class, bought cam-
eras to practice editing, attended film 
review clubs in Chicago and did sum-
mer programs on screenwriting. One 
summer, she took Advanced Placement 
Biology so she could pack in more di-
recting classes during the school year. 
Gracie was cruising. 

I felt like my car was going nowhere. I 

had no plans. I had no idea what I want-
ed to do in college, let alone after col-
lege. I also couldn’t admit to myself that 
I might also be interested in screenwrit-
ing. How could we possibly have simi-
lar destinations if I was seven thousand 
miles behind her on the road? I wasn’t 
doing screenwriting clubs or assist-
ing the high school film teacher with 
his intro classes. On top of this, Gracie 
cracked out a 36 on the ACT going into 
senior year. First try, cold. I spent the 
entire year at my desk, working, claw-
ing, test after test, for one more singular 
point. I began to feel small and unim-
pressive. I never measured up. Like ev-
erything else, I couldn’t help but com-
pare my results to my twin sister.

“Stay in your own lane,” my mom re-

peated. 

But I couldn’t. I wanted to desire a 

specific career path so I could do im-
pressive activities in pursuit of it. I 
wanted to be easy-going and relaxed. I 
wanted the gracefulness that was quite 
literally embedded in my sister’s name. 
Gracie’s decisions, ambitions and fear-
lessness felt impossible for me to both 
achieve and simultaneously ignore.

As humans, it can be difficult to stay 

in our own lane without looking around 
at the others. Research suggests that 
about 10% of human thought is com-
parative. Yes, our individual lives may 
occupy singular lanes, but windows ex-
ist for a reason. There are other cars on 
the road — you can’t ignore them. As 
a matter of fact, in driver’s education, 
we were taught to check our mirrors 
every five seconds. Some cars are even 
equipped with blinking light systems 
that alert you of the positions of ve-
hicles in neighboring lanes. Whether it 
be for safety, for motivation or just from 
plain-old intuition, we compare.

Beyond being necessary to acknowl-

edge, I think the other cars can also be 
helpful. Watching Gracie’s car has given 
me strengths in areas I was admittedly 
lacking in. My willingness to experi-
ment — to go to overnight camp, write 
short plays or befriend different types of 
people — is inspired by her open-mind-
edness. My grit and drive to succeed 
have been shaped by Gracie’s natural 
academic ability. It’s undeniable: Floor-
ing the pedal on my sputtering truck in 
order to keep up with her Lambo has 
certainly been a character builder. 

We cannot simply keep our eyes 

ahead of us. If I adhered strictly to my 
mom’s metaphor — if I didn’t check 
over at Gracie at all — I don’t think I’d 
be driving at the speed that I am now 
or be as willing to swerve around in my 
own lane. Had I locked eyes on the ho-
rizon my entire life, I wouldn’t be who I 
am now. Gracie inspired me to work on 
my shortcomings rather than run away 
from them. 
I 

recently read that poet Amanda 
Gorman has a twin sister, Ga-
brielle Gorman. Gabrielle is also 

unbelievably impressive. She’s worked 
on digital marketing campaigns for 
TOMS, directed a short documentary 
and was presented with the Aaron Sor-
kin Writing Award, among other feats. I 
wonder if, when Amanda struggled with 
her speech impediment, she shared my 
sputtering truck sentiment. Did she get 
inspiration to keep going from Gabrielle 
as I did from Gracie? Maybe seeing each 
other’s cars pushed them along, too. 

Since I’ve been at the University of 

Michigan, I’ve lost sight of Gracie in my 
mirrors. I’m navigating the hustle and 
bustle of Ann Arbor and she, the tree-
lined roads of New Hampshire. Not only 
have I left my lifelong bar of comparison, 
but I’m navigating unfamiliar streets 
— dance teams, newspaper columns, 
new classes (including film) and new 
friends. They say being on the open road 
alone grants perspective, and I’ve found 

that to be true. No longer surrounded by 
Gracie and everyone else who has been 
driving around me since grade school, 
I’ve been able to focus more easily on 
my lane, and I like the freedom. 

Now that I’m on my own, I realize I 

had spent so much time checking the 
mirrors that I was failing to see what 
was right in front of me, and what has 
always been within me. The summer 
that Gracie did Northwestern’s Cherubs 
Screenwriting Program, I was at over-
night camp. The summer she took AP 
Bio, I went on a teen tour with my best 
friends. While perhaps less impressive 
on a resume, those experiences were 
right for me: a social, fun-loving girl, 
without a specific dream that needed to 
be pursued immediately. My road has 
been fun, comedic and even impres-
sive in a lot of areas. I should’ve been 
confident in my route and enjoyed it, 
looking forward and trusting my own 
directional abilities. Maybe one day I’ll 
screenwrite too, and it doesn’t matter if 
I’m seven thousand miles behind Gra-
cie. I’m exploring other routes, seeing 
amazing sights. There’s no race or finish 
line.

Moreover, everyone’s lane gets bumpy 

on occasion. Gracie went to college far 
away with no friends. She recently came 
home due to a mononucleosis-strep 
throat-bacterial infection trifecta. I now 
check on Gracie over Facetime — not to 
see if we’re equidistant on the road, but 
to make sure she’s doing okay in her car. 
Everyone’s Lambo feels like an old truck 
sometimes. 

So I’d like to revise my mom’s advice 

to: “Check your mirrors, but trust your 
own lane.” Glancing at other people 
and taking a check-in is healthy. We 
grow through comparison and better 
ourselves through competition. But we 
also must be confident in our journey as 
well. 

Different 
drivers 
have 
different 

needs. People take pit stops, switch 
lanes, speed up, slow down. Right 
now Gracie and I are taking separate 
routes, and perhaps it’ll stay that way 
for a while, or maybe we’ll merge, and 
I’ll be able to check over at her Lambo 
once again. Maybe we’ll even have the 
same destination, and we’ll both end up 
with creative careers like Gabrielle and 
Amanda, raise kids at the same time or 
grow old in the same place. There are 
multiple lanes for a reason: so that the 
road is wide enough for two cars. I’m 
glad to have her on my road, I’d be lost 
without her. But I’ll also keep my eyes 
on the horizon in front of me. I deserve 
the trip.

n early April, I screenshotted 
a picture I saw on Wikipedia 
of a cow lying on the ground 

captioned “a sleeping cow laying on her 
side is not immobilized; she can rise 
whenever she chooses.” It epitomized 
early-quarantine lethargy, and I thought 
it was really funny. I kept collecting ob-
scure and amusing Wikipedia excerpts 
and posting screenshots of them to an 
Instagram page I titled @depthsofwiki-
pedia. Nine months later, my once-friv-
olous hobby has changed my life: The 
account has over 120,000 followers, a 
merch line and an ongoing collabora-
tion with Wikipedia to fundraise and re-
cruit editors. Since August, I’ve devoted 
almost all of my free time to the project. 

The account exposes the most curi-

ous corners of Wikipedia, such as a page 
on the “sweater curse,” a documented 
suspicion that hand-knitting a sweater 
for a lover will lead them to break up 
with the knitter. Another is the page 
“Umarell” which describes elderly men 
in Bologna, Italy who watch construc-
tion sites, often with hands clasped be-
hind their backs and offering unwanted 
advice. Other good ones are “List of An-
imals with Fraudulent Diplomas” and 
“Lawsuits against God.” The posts are 
short enough to be shareable but sub-
stantial enough to teach you something, 
and the following has grown organically 
through Instagram story posts. 

I’m not the only University of Michi-

gan student who has recently encoun-
tered the dizzying exhilaration of accu-
mulating more followers than could fit 
in the Big House. Between classes and 
clubs, some U-M undergrads are pour-
ing their time into maintaining large 
internet followings in various corners 
of the web, building communities far 
larger than the glowing rectangle of an 
iPhone. I called some of them to chat about 
navigating midterms, merch deals and spin-
ning ephemeral internet clout into a bona fide 
platform.

Lucy Carpenter is a senior in LSA studying 

communication and media who started post-
ing on her TikTok @carpenlu while studying 
abroad in Australia in January 2020. After her 
return to Michigan for the March shutdown, 
she pivoted to posting colorful montages that 
unveil the process of photography, amassing 
105,000 followers. Over a Zoom call, she told 
me that between classes, a marketing intern-
ship and social media, different pursuits take 
priority at different times. 

“Sometimes when I’m studying and I get a 

really cool idea for a TikTok, I’ll choose to fol-
low it even if I know I should be getting ahead 
on an assignment,” Carpenter said. “In a lot of 
ways, TikTok is more fun than school.” 

Other times, social media gets sent to the 

back burner. In the middle of a busy summer 
internship, she made fewer posts and her fol-
lower growth slowed markedly. “I was okay 
with it because I loved my internship,” Carpen-
ter explained. 

For Carpenter, whose professional interests 

of photography and social media align closely 
with her online niche, both her degree and Tik-
Tok are vehicles to the same post-graduation 
goals. Though she’s seen creators with simi-
lar backgrounds find successful careers after 
dropping out, she’s set on finishing her degree 
both to build business skills and because, as a 
senior, she’s so close to finishing. After gradu-
ating, she’s not sure where she’ll end up but 
hopes to continue creative pursuits. 

“Because of Tiktok, it feels more possible to 

pursue photography full time,” Carpenter said. 
“I now have a network of people all over the 
world.”

Carpenter isn’t the only student using Tik-

Tok to build a professional network. Nick Daly is 
an Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore study-
ing musical theatre whose TikTok account @
nick_t_daly, which approaches 175,000 follow-

ers, has grown steadily since Spring 2020. In a 
Zoom call from his rented Kerrytown room, he 
told me about the account’s start. 

“I got really sad at the beginning of quaran-

tine. Maybe that was the key,” Daly said. “There 
were no opportunities over the summer, so as a 
Musical Theatre major I didn’t know what to 
do, and I was inspired by the spirit of the quote 
‘If you don’t have work, make work.’” 

And that’s exactly what he did. Over the 

summer, Daly posted several videos per day 
highlighting his stunning vocals and accumu-
lating a steady stream of followers. Despite his 
success, he’s found that he now can’t keep up 
with posting at that pace due to piling obliga-
tions. 

“(I’m) super busy working on a play for 

Playfest, sending in auditions for TV and mov-
ies and putting in 20 hours a week at Chipotle,” 
he said. It took a few seconds for him to add, 
“And I’m still a musical theatre major.” 

After winning the prestigious Playbill’s 

Search for a Star award in the fall, he spent the 
first few weeks of the school year engulfed in 
tasks related to the prize. School took a back 
seat at the start of the semester, and Daly felt 
like he never really caught up. 

“I’ve always been of the mind that educa-

tion is more important than a degree. I’d rather 
be skilled than have a piece of paper hanging 
on my wall that says I’m skilled,” he said. “If I 
graduate, it would be cool, but I ultimately just 
want to work in theatre and it doesn’t matter 
whether it’s school or social media that gets me 
there.” 

His agent, who found him through Insta-

gram, messaged him while we were talking to 
ask for another TV show audition to send in. 

Daly doesn’t know what exactly is next for 

him, but he’s grateful to have a platform to com-
municate his passions, such as the importance 
of using art for social change. He’s also excited 
by how much TikTok has expanded his profes-
sional opportunities in the performing arts. 

Social media can advance the business side 

of music endeavors as well. Ari Elkins is a ju-

nior in LSA studying political science and mi-
noring in performing arts management who 
posts TikToks of niche playlists (think “POV: its 
BID Day 2021 and you just accepted your bid 
to your favorite sorority” and “Songs that will 
make you want to go on an adventure”) char-
acterized by impossibly enthusiastic dances, 
bouncy hair and a blithe California coolness.
W

hen his summer 2020 intern-
ship with Warner Music got 
canceled, he spent more time 

posting videos, such as one titled “Songs that 
will take you back to your favorite frat base-
ment,” which catapulted him into prominence 
and entrenched his current niche as a Genera-
tion-Z music curator. 600,000 TikTok follow-
ers later, he has a team of managers, growing 
Youtube and Spotify platforms and a slew of 
brand sponsorship deals. 

He’s taking a full course load at the Uni-

versity, but he estimates a time breakdown of 
70% music and Tiktok work compared to 30% 
school. He told me more about balancing mu-
sic and TikTok with school on a Zoom call. 

“I would only drop out of school if it were 

prohibiting my success and, right now, I’m able 
to balance school and TikTok,” Elkins said. 
“College is important in that it makes you a 
more well-rounded citizen, but if I really think 
about it, I don’t think that a college diploma 
will be directly useful for my current career 
trajectory.” 

This summer, he’s not doing an organized 

internship but instead focusing on personal 
music and TikTok pursuits.

While Elkins has always been interested in 

the music industry, social media success has 
given him resounding encouragement to fur-
ther pursue a career as a music personality. Be-
ing a front-facing figure in the same category as 
Zane Lowe or Ryan Seacrest is within reach for 
Elkins all because of TikTok.

However, not all students are using their 

kernels of fame to directly advance their ca-
reers. Ryan Tippy, an LSA freshman who plans 
to major in public health on a pre-med track, 

struck algorithm gold on a video he 
posted on his TikTok @ryant6969 two 
days after his SATs about looking like 
the Riverdale character Kevin Keller. 
After the post went viral, he continued 
posting witty TikToks in his free time, 
accruing 65,000 followers. Unlike other 
student creators, he’s never considered 
pursuing TikTok as more than a hobby.

“I’m very school-driven,” he said. 

“Being a full-on influencer is not my 
personality. I’m just doing this because 
it makes me laugh.”

A number of other students boast 

mind-bogglingly large account stats, and 
many come from vastly different cor-
ners of the internet. Business freshman 
Simon Kim has built a TikTok commu-
nity of 1.2 million followers on @whole-
somesimon, where he promotes mental 
health efforts with colorful graphics and 
clear-eyed sincerity. On the anime and 
manga side of TikTok, Rackham student 
Jeffery Zhang boasts 900,000 followers. 
Front-camera clips of comedic musings 
brought LSA senior Demetrius Fields to 
1.7 million TikTok followers, and varsity 
basketball player and LSA junior Adrien 
Nunez has amassed nearly a million fol-
lowers on TikTok making couple videos 
with his girlfriend Carson Roney, who 
plays basketball for Shawnee State Uni-
versity.

University of Michigan student cre-

ators are part of a broader cultural rise 
of relatable online creators, a grand 
convergence between restless, quaran-
tined young people and hungry algo-
rithms engineered to manufacture the 
illusion of fame. Subject to the opaque 
mechanisms of algorithm-based con-
tent viewing, the beginning of a popular 
page often comes down to luck. It’s that 
tantalizing first taste of virality that can 
bring about a pivotal, if subtle, decision: 

to keep pursuing internet fame or not. 
The creators I spoke to decided to run with 

it, albeit with varying levels of commitment 
— some treating online creation like a step-
ping stone to their career and others using it 
to pass the time. However, to varying degrees, 
their college experiences are fundamentally 
altered: paid posts informing their schedules, 
ring lights in dorm rooms, private Zoom chats 
in class asking “Are you from TikTok?” and an 
inescapable sense that if they don’t keep up an 
endless stream of content, their fleeting home-
grown fame will dissolve just as quickly as it 
appeared. 

Each student creator echoed familiar sen-

timents of gratitude for their platforms. We 
agreed that working on social media feels, for 
the most part, like an exciting antidote to mo-
notonous online classes. 

Personally, it’s running @depthsofwiki-

pedia the best part of my year, offering bright 
moments of novelty amidst the monotony of 
quarantine. Amidst Canvas notifications and 
club emails are notifications of follows from 
celebrity crushes (like John Mayer) and inter-
esting messages from strangers. I’ve also gotten 
more involved with the workings of Wikipedia, 
learning to edit and organizing an edit-a-thon 
in January. 

One of my greatest takeaways from online 

classes is how much agency I have over what 
I learn. Digital learning has, in many ways, 
challenged traditional models of learning in 
which a teacher presents information in front 
of a class. When I’m learning class material 
online, I’ve found myself more likely to seek 
out independent education resources, opting 
for Youtube explainers over clogged Zoom 
office hours and skipping asynchronous lec-
ture videos to make notes from a textbook. 
Viewing classes as education guides, not nec-
essarily essential manuals, empowers me to 
broaden the activities considered to be educa-
tional. Through this lens, some of the lessons 
I’m learning from social media feel just as vital 
as those from schoolwork.

Midterms and merch lines: U-M 
influencers speak on balancing 
school and social media

W

hen I turned 13, like 
many Jews around the 
United States and the 

rest of the world, I was bar mitzvahed. 
Upon the conclusion of my service, 
after reciting blessings and reading 
from the Torah, I was rushed to an 
unmarked back room. The room was 
small and consisted of just a single 
chair facing a video monitor. It was 
there where I received a call from 
the Rothschild family. I was finally 
old enough to be given my very first 
Jewish space laser.

If it wasn’t clear that this did 

not happen, I will tell you now. It 
did not happen. There are no such 
things as Jewish space lasers. Any 
sane, sensible, respectful person 
should know this, but none of those 
adjectives apply to U.S. Rep. Marjorie 
Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Greene has 
become notorious over the last few 
months for parroting all kinds of 
bigoted conspiracies. Most famously, 
her comments about Jewish space 
lasers causing California’s 2018 
wildfires. 
However, 
Greene’s 

comments reflect a larger problem 
within the Republican Party. Their 
increasing acceptance of conspiracy 
theories should worry everyone, 
regardless of party affiliation, and 
must be met face on and put to an end. 

Greene’s conspiracy, which drew 

some of the most intense backlashes, 
came from one of her resurfaced 
Facebook posts from 2018. She wrote 
about how the California wildfires 
were caused by a space laser and that 
the “Vice Chairman of Rothschild Inc, 
international investment banking firm” 
was somehow involved. The rest of her 
post rambled on about how alternative 
energy panels in space were reflecting 
rays from the sun back to earth in 
order to increase stock prices and help 
wealthy investors. Aside from making 
zero scientific or logical sense, it is also 
blatantly anti-Semitic, as blaming the 
Rothschild family is a century-old anti-
Semitic tactic to scapegoat Jews for 
society’s problems.

That was just the surface of 

Greene’s conspiracies. Greene openly 
supports QAnon, a discredited and 
disproven 
right-wing 
conspiracy 

theory that incorporates the “deep 
state” and a global elite that consists 
of pedophiles, Satan worshippers and 
cannibals who plotted against former 
President Donald Trump and has 
gathered a cult-like following. She 
also claims that no plane crashed into 
the Pentagon on 9/11, the Parkland 
shooting was a false flag event and 
Sandy Hook was staged. On top of all 
that, Greene “repeatedly indicated 
support for executing prominent 
Democratic politicians in 2018 and 
2019 before being elected to Congress.” 
Writing about all of Greene’s theories 
is a daunting task but overall, they 
largely all consist of the same 
Islamophobic, xenophobic, racist, anti-
Semitic and dangerous rhetoric. 

As more and more of Greene’s 

theories surfaced, House Democrats 
called for her removal from her 
assignments on the Education and 
Budget Committees. In a 230-199 vote, 
with just 11 Republicans joining all of 
the Democrats, Greene was removed 
from her committee seats, drastically 
reducing her ability to enact and 
contribute to policy making. While 
her political power has been hindered, 
what is still concerning are the 199 
Republicans who did not believe 
Greene deserved to be punished for 
her comments. Yet, this should come 
as no surprise. About a month after 
voting to overturn the election results 
and choosing to support Trump’s lies 
about election fraud, the vast majority 
of House Republicans still cannot hold 
their own accountable. 

The current Republican party 

is 
infused 
with 
conspiratorial 

lies that contribute to hate and 
violence. Last fall, in a vote to 
condemn QAnon, 18 Republicans 
voted against condemning the 
dangerous conspiracy theory. In 
other words, 18 Republicans refused 
to denounce a disproven theory 
that Democrats, celebrities and 
a “global elite” conspire to traffic 
children, drink children’s blood 
and conspire against Trump and 
his supporters. These beliefs are 
not isolated within politicians either. 
In a recent YouGov poll, 30% of 
self-proclaimed Republicans had 

a “favorable” opinion of QAnon. At 
first glance, this seems like a polling 
anomaly. An NPR/Ipsos poll found 
that 17% of Americans, including 
23% of Republicans, believe that a 
“group of Satan-worshipping elites 
who run a child sex ring are trying to 
control our politics and media” — a 
vital principle of QAnon. If this is the 
direction that the Republican Party 
is going in, they are going down a 
path that cannot be followed. 

So what can we all do to stop the 

spread of threatening and harmful 
conspiracies that have real-world 
consequences? First things first 
we have to understand how people 
get sucked into believing these 
things. The first mistake people 
make is believing that only stupid 
or unintelligent people become 
followers of QAnon. Like many 
cults, QAnon provides people with 
a feeling that they belong to an elite 
community, offering them a sense 
of belonging. Although it is not an 
easy task, and the tactics are widely 
debated amongst extremism experts, 
once more is understood about how 
QAnon attracts new followers, the 
work can be done to de-radicalize 
them. 

While some conspiracy theories 

can be harmless like Bigfoot or 
the Loch Ness monster, other 
conspiracies 
have 
real-world 

consequences that should be taken 
seriously by everyone. We have 
already seen the damage that 
election fraud conspiracies have had 
when thousands of people stormed 
the U.S. Capitol Building leaving 
five dead and dozens more injured. 
QAnon followers have already been 
caught threatening to kidnap and 
even assassinate public figures. 
As QAnon grows in popularity 
and edges closer to becoming 
mainstream within the Republican 
Party, even more violence will 
accompany it. The time is now to 
put an end to QAnon’s conspiratorial 
influence within the GOP before 
they become the GQP.

The Grand Old Party of conspiracies

A

fter the first public health school 
was established at Johns Hopkins 
University a century ago, the 

interdisciplinary practice has found a home 
in universities nationwide. Without a doubt, 
public health researchers and professionals 
have led the charge in understanding what 
a healthy society might look like, while 
simultaneously striving to create it. Here at the 
University of Michigan, the School of Public 
Health is one of the best in the nation. This 
doesn’t come as a surprise. What does come 
as a surprise from a university that champions 
itself as the “Leaders and the Best” is its 
perpetuation of diet culture and fatphobia via 
the weight-normative curriculum it bolsters. 
The lack of awareness around how these roots 
contradict its mission of promoting public 
health needs to be addressed. 

Fortunately, within the School of Public 

Health, a professor is pioneering a public 
health approach that forgoes beliefs born out 
of diet culture and fatphobia, opting instead for 
a weight-inclusive approach which encourages 
healthy behaviors irrespective of one’s weight. 
Dr. Kendrin Sonneville, Sc.D., R.D., is an 
assistant professor in the Department of 
Nutritional Sciences whose research focuses 
on eating disorder prevention. To say her 
background and current work is impressive is 
an understatement. 

Sonneville is one of a handful of public 

health faculty members that align themselves 
with the Health at Every Size framework, 
and to her knowledge, she is the only faculty 
member at the school who explicitly orients 
herself as a weight-inclusive researcher. She 
teaches a Weight Bias & Health course — the 
first and only freestanding class on weight 

bias at any public health school — and the 
work she does with her team at the Sonneville 
Lab for Weight-Inclusive Nutrition & Eating 
Disorders Prevention is monumental. 

Sonneville is undoubtedly leading the 

charge here at the University’s School of Public 
Health to transform the foundation of public 
health into one that is weight inclusive and 
challenges misconceptions surrounding weight 
— namely that from weight alone, you can come 
to conclusions about one’s health status. She 
shared her thoughts on the state of the school’s 
curriculum and mainstream public health 
while providing suggestions on where to go 
from here so that relevant programs can move 
closer to achieving their mission. 

Despite being a bit of an outsider within 

a department where most faculty members 
conform to the weight-normative model — 
for example, holding the belief that people 
classified as “overweight” or “obese” under 
existing standards must lose weight to 
become healthier — Sonneville has been met 
with curiosity and open-mindedness from 
colleagues and students intrigued by her 
approach. “Even though my approach may 
feel relatively radical within a department of 
nutrition,” she said, “I think there’s an interest 
in understanding this paradigm, so even 
though people aren’t necessarily identifying 
as ‘all-in,’ there is a curiosity that comes from 
my presence.” Students in particular have been 
receptive to the HAES approach and her classes 
continue to draw more curious minds in. 

It’s not lost on Sonneville that she has been 

able to venture into new territory with classes 
and research focusing on weight bias and 
eating disorders prevention and treatment due 
to support from her department chair and the 

school as a whole. For that, she is grateful.

“I do think that the support my particular 

teaching and research program is getting 
speaks volumes about our School of Public 
Health,” she said. The department’s approval 
of her courses, which are nonexistent in other 
places, has been their best decision yet. 

Moreover, alumni of Sonneville’s courses 

have gone on to do meaningful and highly 
demanded work in the eating disorder 
space. They are the ones changing the public 
health landscape from weight-normative to 
weight-inclusive — and for the better. Alyson 
McAdams, M.P.H, RDN, graduated from 
the School of Public Health in 2017 and 
has established a career around the HAES 
framework. As a registered dietician working 
in pediatric primary care, McAdams credits 
Sonneville for her exposure to this weight-
inclusive framework. At the same time, she 
also acknowledges that the University as a 
whole didn’t provide enough education on 
this approach or eating disorders, instead 
putting too much of an emphasis on weight 
normativity and solving the obesity epidemic. 

Even when faculty and other students 

acknowledged that intentional weight loss 
diets do not work in the long run for a majority 
of people, when I interviewed McAdams, she 
said the framing of larger-bodied people as a 
problem in need of a solution remained. The 
escape from this message for McAdams 
was Sonneville’s courses. “Kendrin’s class 
was definitely the only place where I felt like 
weight-inclusive language and practices were 
more overtly talked about,” McAdams said. 
Even those around her who saw weight stigma 
as a problem were missing the point.

“For many of us, we were still stuck in that 

lens of, ‘weight stigma is a problem because it 
contributes to weight gain, and weight gain 
and larger bodies are a problem,’ ” McAdams 
elaborated. Thus, further development is 
needed in the curriculum so that students can 
detach from the assumption that weight gain 
is inherently negative. 

Addressing weight stigma as a factor 

contributing to weight gain while still viewing 
weight gain as inherently in need of a solution 
misses the point entirely. To dismantle weight 
stigma means to reject the belief that efforts 
targeted at improving health need to be 
targeted at lowering one’s weight. 

McAdams also confirmed that the bulk of 

the required curriculum, specifically for the 
dietetics track of the Master’s in Public Health 
program, was extremely weight-normative 
and fatphobic.

“For example, we had a pathophysiology of 

obesity class that was required, but the eating 
disorders class was an elective,” McAdams 
said. Now in practice, she is bewildered by 
this. “Eating disorders and disordered eating 
show up all the time, and at the beginning 
of my practice, that was something I had 
to immediately seek continuing education 
about.” 

McAdams’ own initiative to self-educate 

on the topic is applaudable, but soon-to-
be-dietitians ought to already have this 
knowledge and a quality skillset surrounding 
eating disorders, given their prevalence in 
society. And, unfortunately, few dietetics 
professionals are as proactive as McAdams. 
On the whole, the dietetics field is saturated 
with providers who spew harmful, fatphobic 
messages about food and the body, not to 
mention many actively struggling themselves 

with their own disordered relationship with 
the two. These messages are detrimental to all 
who seek out their professional services, but 
for those going to these dietitians to recover 
from their eating disorder, it can be traumatic 
and a major setback in their pursuit of recovery. 

Clearly, there is still plenty of room for 

profound changes in the curriculum. Only 
when such changes are made can the School 
of Public Health truly and accurately self-
identify as a leader in the public health field. 
These changes will be no easy feat. With diet 
culture beliefs about weight as embedded 
in the research on health as they are today — 
both in public health and medical research 
— major shifts are needed in both spaces and 
our broader culture before any substantial 
improvements can be made. 

Luckily, Sonneville has tangible first steps 

in mind that are feasible with the support of 
her department chairs, who are influential 
players in curriculum development. She 
finds that integrating the weight-inclusive 
framework into core curriculum rather than 
requiring classes that are solely HAES aligned 
may be most effective because it would not 
cast this framework as some niche field of 
its own. Incorporating it into the existing 
weight-normative curriculum also replicates 
the context in which many graduates will 
be working: one where weight stigma will 
be present, and weight will be valued as an 
independent health indicator.

We’re #1?

T

his Super Bowl Sunday, 
General Motors Co. aired 
an advertisement for their 

new electric vehicle battery, the 
Ultium. This comes in the wake of 
GM announcing that they will stop 
producing 
gas-powered 
vehicles 

by 2035. This was my favorite 
advertisement of Super Bowl LV 
and I would recommend giving it 
a quick watch for context. The ad 
starred Will Ferrell, Awkwafina 
and Kenan Thompson. The plot is 
that America is being trounced by 
Norway when it comes to electric 
vehicle implementation, and Ferrell 
and his compatriots are on a mission 
to change that. This ad, released on 
one of the most competitive days on 
the American calendar, supplies a 
blueprint for using the American 
competitive spirit as a vehicle for 
positive change. 

There is an incredible pool of 

competitive energy in the United 
States. I’m sure you have seen the 
reports of rampant partying and 
disorder in Tampa, Fla., after this 
Super Bowl Sunday, and that’s just 
energy from one American team 
beating another. For a view of how 
competitive we can get with other 
countries just look to the Olympics. 

Does anyone care about curling 

any non-Olympic years? No! But 
when it is framed as a competition 
where America needs to take its 
rightful place on the winner’s podium, 
heads from Seattle to Sarasota, Fla., 
pop up, and the competitive fuse is lit.

The precise language of competing 

with other countries has possibly 
turned sour in the ears of many left-
leaning people throughout the last 
few years. This is because former 
President Donald Trump was an 
avid user of winner-take-all rhetoric 
in U.S. foreign policy. Specifically, 
Trump’s 
America 
First 
policies 

explicitly relied on a competitive and 
even confrontational lens to interpret 
the rest of the world. However, 
competitive rhetoric can be employed 
in a responsible and positive way, 
like Ferrell confidently talking about 
his desire to “crush those lugers” 
to engender a passion for a more 
sustainable transportation system. 

For an example of how this 

competitive spirit has been harnessed 

to pull political goals along, look 
no further than the Space Race. 
In 1962, former President John F. 
Kennedy gave his famous address at 
Rice University. Kennedy called on 
Americans to keep their eye on the 
ball: “For while we cannot guarantee 
that we shall one day be first, we can 
guarantee that any failure to make 
this effort will make us last.” 

Kennedy and Ferrell share a 

strategy to motivate Americans. Not 
only do they want us to covet winning, 
but they also want us to loathe 
losing. Kennedy was demonstrably 
successful in using this strategy, as 
his competitive rhetoric ensured 
robust space program funding, which 
resulted in an eventual victory in 1969 
when Americans were the first to set 
foot on the moon.

We have established that this is a 

strategy, but what could it best be used 
for today? Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
may have an idea. Whitmer ran on a 
platform focused on fixing Michigan’s 
roads. Currently, the U.S. gets a D+ in 
infrastructure from the American 
Society of Civil Engineers. Our national 
infrastructure would be a perfect 
target for a competitive strategy. After 
all, the interstate highway system was 
born out of a competitive spirit. Former 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
noticed that Germany had a fantastic 
highway system and decided the U.S. 
wouldn’t be relegated to second-tier 
infrastructure — thus the Interstate 
highway system was born.

Kyle Kulinski, a co-founder of the 

progressive 
organization 
Justice 

Democrats, 
recently 
tweeted 
a 

prescient 
policy 
prescription: 

“The US should do a multi trillion 
dollar infrastructure deal with the 
expressed goal of being #1 in the world 
on that front. … It’s a unifying national 
project with countless upsides.” 

This is exactly the type of strategy 

we should be employing to move 
the national conversation toward 
significant infrastructure spending. 
The innate pride in being American and 
wanting to be number one in the world 
is conditioned into someone from an 
early age, and I feel it strongly as I write 
this. Understanding and harnessing 
this competitive spirit will be vital in 
cutting through the cacophonous noise 
of the modern political climate.

Of course, infrastructure is not the 

only area where this strategy could 
be effective. There are several areas 
where the U.S. has fallen behind, and 
many Americans might not even 
realize it. Take our democracy for 
example. Its weaknesses have already 
been well explored by thinkers much 
more in tune with the processes than 
I, so I will simply say that cracks are 
starting to show in institutions that 
many Americans formerly perceived 
as robust. Democracy isn’t something 
that we think of competitively, but we 
absolutely should — many countries do 
elections better (and tastier) than we 
do. One such country is Australia. 

Elections in Australia are held on 

Saturdays, as opposed to Tuesdays as 
in the U.S. Australia has a compulsory 
voting system, and you can get fined 
about $15 for not doing your civic 
duty. Voting is seen as a responsibility 
and not just as a right, so about 96% 
of Australians vote in each election, 
compared to just 66.7% of Americans 
who voted in the last election. 

Finally, and most important to my 

palate, at many Australian polling 
places there will be a prominent 
showing of democracy sausages — 
basically a hot dog which voters can 
purchase when they turn up to the 
polls. Overall, voting is seen as more 
of a block party than an errand. Both 
the institutions and the culture around 
voting in Australia are something that I 
expect many Americans to both enjoy 
and benefit from. But I don’t think we 
should adopt their system and culture 
because we need to do better. We need 
to beat them — we need to be number 
one — but only in a way that fits the 
spirit of our nation.

Electric 
cars, 
democracy, 

infrastructure and innovation. All 
things that we as a nation should 
strive to do better at, not just for our 
own sake, but for our national sense 
of pride. Will Ferrell, Kennedy and 
Trump aren’t the most similar people, 
but they all struck a fundamental 
chord of what it means to be an 
American. Americans like to win, 
and when issues are framed as either 
winning or losing to the rest of the 
world, a lot can get done.

I

t’s incredibly odd to be a freshman 
right now. Instead of having animated 
discussions 
sitting 
on 
lawns 
and 

benches around campus, we occasionally 
send necessary texts through GroupMes and 
Discords. Instead of exploring and getting 
used to a new campus, we navigate our 
university online. 

Newcomers don’t have a place, a community 

or an understanding of the University of 
Michigan in its regular workings. Instead, we 
traverse through the “Zoom-Zone.”

 It’s a term I picked up from Connor Greer, 

the phenomenal ENG 223 writing instructor. 
“Zoom-Zone” (or “ZOOM-ZONE,” as he says) 
refers to the virtually built environment in 
which most of our interactions exist. The 
“Zoom-Zone” has replaced the University’s 
physical environment, i.e. walking around 
from class to class, attending social gatherings 
or exploring campus. Now, we meet people 
and visit places on a screen, often from inside 
our childhood bedrooms. When our campus 
shut down last semester, students transitioned 
from in-person to virtual learning. Now, we 
know the University in a different form— for 
many freshmen, the only way we’ve ever 
known the University is through emails, 
online classes and group chats.

Zoom itself is a wondrous thing — two 

people (from opposite corners of the planet, if 
need be) can reach out through space and time 
and see each other’s faces. However, centering 
all of one’s social interactions in Zoom can 
feel exhausting. Many experience Zoom 
fatigue. Online interaction isn’t the same as 
in-person interaction — without nonverbal 
cues, it’s more challenging to focus. Speaking 
through the “Zoom-Zone” can feel like a 
performance and a puzzle simultaneously. 

One is trying to deduce the other person’s 
feelings while attempting to appear friendly 
and in control, without nonverbal social cues. 
Because attending Zoom calls can often 
feel like charades, first-year students might 
not be as eager to participate in classes and 
organizations online as they are in person. 
Thus, no one knows each other, except vaguely, 
in a digital context. There’s barely a sense of 
togetherness for the freshman class, apart 
from our sparingly active Facebook group. 

Additionally, the “Zoom-Zone” has a 

funny way of flattening power structures — 
sometimes, almost inverting them. While 
Zoom discussions can feel more democratic 
(which can be a good thing), they lead to some 
chaotic situations. Often, in class, students 
are technology-adept, while instructors can 
sometimes struggle. With multiple people 
speaking at once, it’s more challenging to keep 
a class in order. 

The chat feature in Zoom, especially, 

completely changes the dynamic of classes, 
where people can send a text without being 
seen or heard. In one of my courses last semester 
(a large, 180-person class), the chat was so active 
that it was turned off every class, especially 
when students had complaints about the 
course. Students are given much more power 
in online classes. While sometimes beneficial, 
it can be odd for freshmen, who can be unsure 
how to act in their classes and otherwise. 

Like many others, I find myself reminiscing 

about life before COVID-19. In November 2018, 
I went to my first ever Michigan football game. 
Surrounded by more people than I could ever 
imagine now, I laughed, whooped, yelled 
and chanted. Periodically, the crowd would 
get up and perform the fight song, ending 
with 100,000 voices yelling out “Go Blue!” in 

unison. Completely enamored, I couldn’t 
stop fantasizing about my future college 
experience at the University: Ideas of freedom, 
parties and football games swirled together 
in my mind. I couldn’t wait to know the fight 
song, back-to-front, and chant “Go Blue!” 

Now, the only time freshmen come across 

the phrase is when we see a halfhearted “Go 
Blue” at the end of an email offering COVID-
19 updates. It’s important to note why campus 
life is changed — the relentless spread of 
COVID-19, especially spurred by those who 
go about their lives as if there’s no virus. 
People who choose to party are prolonging the 
situation. They’re making everyone’s lives — 

including their own — much harder and more 
dangerous. 

The lack of response from the institution 

and the introduction of new COVID-19 
variants in Ann Arbor only exacerbates the 
problem. While people continue to disregard 
their communities, it seems unlikely that the 
pandemic will slow down anytime soon.

What’s 
confusing 
is 
the 
different 

predictions of when society will return to 
“normal.” Sources contrast each other, with 
some claiming the pandemic will be around 
for the next few years, while some are 
claiming the situation will be better by July. 
Will we ever leave this purgatory and find our 

place in the community? Will we ever mature 
past our high school selves? Will we ever 
get the so-called college experience? More 
importantly, will we and our communities 
make it through the pandemic?

It’s overwhelming. The idea of the typical 

college experience feels too good to be true — 
hopefully, we’ll get to see it for ourselves in the 
future. Currently, it all feels unclear. As the 
freshmen’s connection to the university feels 
weak, we float around, alone, untethered in 
the “Zoom-Zone,” unsure of what comes next. 

O

n a warm August afternoon in the 
Law Quadrangle, my boyfriend and 
I finally had the dreaded talk about 

our exes. Beaming with pride, he revealed 
that he was still friends with many of his exes, 
with some of them comprising his group of 
best friends. I suppressed an eye roll as I told 
him that I wasn’t in contact with most of mine, 
with a few even being blocked on social media. 
Eyebrows raised, he looked at me with the 
all-too-familiar smirk of superiority that 
I’ve become accustomed to receiving from 
those who take pride in staying friends 
with their exes.

My lack of contact with my exes isn’t 

necessarily due to bad relationships, messy 
breakups or even miscommunication. I simply 
believe that the period after a relationship ends 
is prime time for personal growth and that 
afterward, you shouldn’t be around somebody 

who reminds you of a past version of yourself. 

In addition, I think that more often than 

not, the decision to stay friends with an ex is 
precipitated by a desire to hold on to a person 
who was once a big part of your life. This is a 
completely natural impulse, but resisting it 
allows you to become the person you really 
want to be without being imprisoned by the 
shackles of your past.

I won’t stand on a soapbox and preach 

at you, though. Last year, after breaking up 
with my long-term high school boyfriend, I 
immediately launched myself into a series of 
flings and hookups, quickly finding myself 
entrapped in strange love triangles and 
awkward run-ins. A few weeks of backsliding 
with my ex eventually gave way to another 
period of no-contact, during which he blocked 
me on social media. Months later, I asked if we 
could be friends, but once we began talking 

again, I quickly realized that friendship with 
him was unnecessary for both of us — nothing 
more than a remnant of the past few years 
that was determined to linger forever if 
we allowed it.

Friendships with exes can also easily 

become toxic, be it for yourself, a new 
relationship or even mutual friends. Research 
suggests that friendships between exes 
generally have more negative aspects 
than other cross-sex platonic friendships. 
Additionally, exes are often used as emotional 
substitutions for a new partner when that 
new relationship takes a turn for the worse. 
Exes can cause feelings of jealousy and 
territorialism in a new partner, creating 
unnecessary tension and chaos in the early 
stages of a relationship. 

This is not to say that it’s impossible or even 

useless to be friends with an ex. My boyfriend 

has a successful, healthy friendship with one 
of his exes, where they are both assets to each 
other’s lives. That said, most other ventures 
at friendships with ex-significant others do 
not go as swimmingly, which can serve as a 
detriment to personal growth. Friendship 
with an ex isn’t inherently a sign of 
maturity and often can belie an inability to 
think critically about the people who are 
allowed in your life.

There is power in being able to know 

when to close a chapter of your life and 
move on without attachments. Studies 
show that adolescents who are able to 
reevaluate their friendships had stronger 
exploration, and therefore firmer identities 
compared to peers who didn’t frequently 
engage in this reassessment. 

Knowing when to leave someone behind 

gives you the power to decide which parts 

of yourself to leave behind with them.

I think about my exes still. Sometimes, 

when I see a funny Snapchat memory 
with my ex from senior year of high 
school or walk past their apartment 
complex on my way to class, I have the 
urge to text them just to let them know I 
was thinking about them. 

My exes have become a part of me in 

some way or another and I am grateful for 
the experiences I’ve had because of them, but 
there’s a reason that they’re memories. I’ve 
learned a lot from them, which allows me to 
cuddle up on the couch with my boyfriend 
this Valentine’s Day, watch “To All The 
Boys I’ve Loved Before 3” and revel in 
being in the present.

ot 
long 
ago, 
a 
2018 

Facebook post from U.S. 
Rep. 
Marjorie 
Taylor 

Greene, R-Ga., resurfaced. In it, she 
attributed the California wildfires to 
a space laser controlled by the Pacific 
Gas and Electric Company, which 
is owned by Rothschild Inc., and 
indicated that the land was burned 
in an elaborate scheme to construct 
a high-speed rail project. 

Her beliefs are unfortunately just 

another iteration of the “all-powerful 
Jews will do anything to make a buck” 
trope. Granted, it’s a pretty funny 
iteration. Many Jewish Twitter users 
posted about the theory, joking about 
the blatant anti-Semitism. After all, 
how could a secret Jewish space laser 
truly remain a secret with Jewish 
mothers everywhere wanting nothing 
more than to brag about their children?

We Jewish people tend to joke 

about 
widespread 
anti-Semitic 

conspiracy theories because, frankly, 
if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry. Greene’s 
theory is just one of many that draw 
on age-old stereotypes about Jewish 
people to villainize them. While quite 
laughable, it isn’t much crazier than 
the anti-Semitic beliefs of many other 
holders of public office. We shouldn’t 
be surprised by politicians’ rampant 
bigotry, but we should be fighting it.

Anti-Semitism has a long and dark 

history in the United States, primarily 
beginning in the late 19th century. 
Many Jews immigrated from Europe 
to the U.S. at the end of the 1800s 
and at the beginning of the 1900s, 
arriving in America as propertyless 
immigrants. However, they quickly 
adjusted and advanced professionally, 
angering many Americans who were 
less successful. 

At this point, the stereotype was 

born in America that Jews controlled 
all 
the 
money 
and 
exploited 

government systems for their own 
financial gain. Needless to say, this 
belief pervaded American society 
and it continues to rear its ugly head, 
even today.

Unfortunately, 
the 
American 

political system is not immune to 

the widespread anti-Semitism in 
the U.S. Government officials on 
both the right and left have targeted, 
and continue to target, Jewish 
people, using the money-controlling 
stereotype to redirect the blame for 
economic and governmental failures. 

Sen. 
Mitch 
McConnell, 

R-Ky., 
released 
a 
YouTube 

advertisement 
during 
his 

reelection campaign in which he 
claimed that the Democrats “have 
liberal billionaires like George 
Soros and Mike Bloomberg,” two 
individuals who happen to be 
Jewish. In doing so, he furthered 
the previously discussed trope 
that Jews control the money 
and use their financial power to 
control the government. Similarly, 
former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., 
published 
an 
advertisement 

featuring 
his 
Democratic 

opponent, Jewish Sen. Jon Ossoff, 
D-Ga., with an enlarged nose. In 
the video, Ossoff appeared with 
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also 
Jewish, while a voiceover claimed 
that the Jews were planning to 
“buy Georgia.” 

Of course, one cannot discuss 

anti-Semitism in American politics 
without referencing QAnon, a 
conspiracy theory in which Rep. 
Taylor Greene is a believer. One 
element of the QAnon theory is the 
Great Replacement. 

Supposedly, Jewish people are 

organizing a mass migration of 
people of color into predominantly 
white 
countries 
to 
eliminate 

and 
replace 
primarily 
white 

populations. 
Ironically, 
Pew 

Research Center’s 2013 study 
found that 90% of American Jews 
identify as non-Hispanic white. 
While this finding does not speak 
to the racial identity of Jews 
around the world, it is interesting 
that a presumably largely white 
ethnic group would orchestrate the 
elimination of white populations. 
But hey, Jews have all the power, 
right? If they want it, they’ll find a 
way to make it happen.

At the end of the day, it’s all 

the same. Jewish people are 
scapegoated 
for 
the 
country’s 

troubles, the reasoning being that 
they control the money and thus 
the world. This same anti-Semitic 
trope appears over and over again 
in American politics, so why is 
anyone surprised by Rep. Taylor 
Greene’s outlandish space laser 
theory? What is it, if not a more 
creative way of saying the same 
thing similar politicians have been 
saying for years: Jewish people 
control the money, and they use 
their wealth to make anything they 
want to happen?

While 
conspiracy 
theories 

like this are humorous, they are 
indicative of a much bigger issue. 
Anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise 
in the U.S. Non-violent acts of anti-
Semitism are becoming acceptable 
in 
the 
American 
political 

system: 
anti-Semitic 
campaign 

advertisements, social media posts 
and conspiracy theories. We as 
American people are normalizing 
anti-Semitism, and as an American 
Jew, it’s scary.

Fortunately, there are things 

we can do to put an end to the 
rampant anti-Semitism in the U.S. 
When voting, we must focus not 
only on policy but on candidates’ 
character. Have they made bigoted 
posts on social media? Have 
they supported other bigoted 
candidates? These are questions 
we must ask before voting. We 
must also call out anti-Semitism 
when we see it and educate our 
peers on the dangers associated 
with anti-Semitism. 

Taylor 
Greene’s 
“Jewish 

space lasers” conspiracy theory 
is not itself the problem, but is 
rather a symptom of the bigger 
issue of anti-Semitism. We, as 
Americans, have allowed for its 
spread, but we, as Americans, 
can promote its end.

The reality of the ‘Jewish space lasers’

Biden’s executive orders break his promise 

of unity in first weeks of presidency

T

ime and again on the 
campaign trail, President 
Joe 
Biden 
pledged 
to 

Americans that despite running as a 
“proud Democrat,” he would “govern 
as an American president.” In a 
time where political divisiveness 
has reached unprecedented levels, 
millions of Americans who voted for 
Biden entrusted him with healing 
our wounded nation.

But after only a few days in the 

Oval Office, Biden seemed to put his 
plans for unity on the back burner by 
issuing executive orders at a record 
pace. Before the end of January alone 
— in the first two weeks of his term — 
Biden signed a startling 25 executive 
orders. 
By 
comparison, 
former 

President Donald Trump signed only 
seven orders in the same time frame 
during his first term; former President 
Barack Obama signed only nine.

Allies of the Biden administration 

rushed to defend the 46th president, 
noting the orders have fulfilled 
a myriad of Democratic policy 
priorities, 
including 
action 
on 

the 
environment, 
immigration 

and 
health 
care. 
Nevertheless, 

Biden’s executive actions stand in 
stark contrast to his own words 
throughout a hard-fought campaign 
that seemed to signal he would work 
across the aisle with legislators, not 
unilaterally with just the stroke of a 
pen. At an ABC News town hall event 
in October, Biden said that instead of 
issuing executive orders, “I’ve gotta 
get the votes (in Congress). We are a 
democracy. We need consensus.” 

He also stated some specific 

policy proposals can’t be passed 
“by executive order unless you’re a 
dictator,” such as raising taxes on 
corporations and wealthy people. 

To be fair, that town hall 

appearance has been misconstrued 
by some — namely, conservatives 
who 
have 
accused 
Biden 
of 

neglecting his own unity claims. But 
at the end of the day, Biden’s flurry of 

executive orders clearly contradicts 
his promise to see not “blue or red 
states but United States.” Even the 
New York Times Editorial Board 
sounded the alarm.

From the moment Biden entered 

the White House, I hoped he would 
immediately begin reaching across 
the aisle to solve some of the most 
pressing issues facing our nation. 
But the incoming president has 
wasted a precious opportunity to 
begin the process of healing our 
nation so desperately needs. The 
current occupant of the White 
House is undoubtedly a welcome 
departure from the divisive Trump 
administration, but he needs to do 
more to bring together our fractured 
country.

Take his executive actions on the 

environment, for instance. On the 
first day of his administration, Biden 
wasted no time canceling the permit 
for the controversial Keystone XL 
pipeline. If completed, the pipeline 
would have transported oil from 
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. This 
project increases our reliance on 
fossil fuels for energy and has been 
attacked by environmentalists for 
years. However, simply eliminating 
the 
Keystone 
pipeline 
without 

working with state or federal 
lawmakers disregards the system of 
government our founders outlined 
more than 200 years ago, which calls 
for checks and balances.

While canceling the permit for 

the Keystone pipeline has removed 
an environmental hazard and the 
encroachment on the indigenous 
communities that inhabit the area, it 
is detrimental to the local economy 
surrounding the proposed pipeline 
and the thousands of people who 
depended on the project to put 
food on the table. Shutting down 
the pipeline isn’t necessarily a bad 
move, but Biden should have worked 
with elected representatives before 
eliminating it on his own.

In the end, what distinguishes 

the U.S. from countries around the 
globe is that no one figure holds too 
much power. After the American 
Revolution, our founders put forth 
the Constitution in order to give equal 
influence to the legislative, executive 
and judicial branches. There’s no 
problem with executive actions for 
small matters, but Biden’s executive 
orders are equivalent to legislating 
from the White House, which is not 
what Americans elected the current 
president to do. At the same time, 
allowing a president to unilaterally 
implement sweeping policy changes 
sets a dangerous precedent for future 
administrations.

From 
the 
moment 
Biden 

secured 
the 
presidency 
in 

November, there was renewed 
hope across America that our 
country could finally turn the page 
on this bitter and divisive time. 
This only became more urgent 
after the attempted insurrection 
on the U.S. Capitol building last 
month. But the prospects of this 
actually happening have grown 
smaller in light of Biden’s far-
reaching executive actions. 

As the president of the United 

States, Biden must resort to 
executive orders sparingly and 
only when that type of action 
is warranted. It’s clear that 
with a narrowly-split House of 
Representatives and an even closer 
Senate, Biden’s policy proposals 
will encounter more resistance in 
Congress. But the 46th president 
took an oath to defend our 
Constitution — and promised 
millions of Americans he would be 
the unifier we all need. That starts 
with putting his pen down and 
working with the legislature, the 
body our founders actually tasked 
with creating the laws.

As the Michigan volleyball 

team clawed back from an 
early deficit in the first set 
of Sunday’s match, freshman 
setter Scottee Johnson tracked 
down and dug a speedy attack 
from 
Purdue. 
Seemingly 

coming 
out 
of 
nowhere, 

freshman outside hitter Jess 
Mruzik emerged from the back 
row and launched a kill into 
the face of Purdue defensive 
specialist 
Jena 
Otec. 
The 

Boilermakers instantly called 
timeout, as the Wolverines’ 
new freshman tandem put the 
league on notice. 

The new freshmen arrivals, 

paired with aggressive offensive 
play from junior Paige Jones, 
however, was not enough to slow 
Purdue. The No. 11 Boilermakers 
(4-4 overall, 4-4 Big Ten) built 
on Saturday’s win en route to a 
3-1 victory over the Wolverines 
(0-2, 0-2). 

After Michigan erased a 

four-point deficit to tie the 
first set at 23, Purdue outside 
hitter Grace Cleveland took 
command, 
slamming 
down 

an emphatic kill to retake 
the lead. From that point, the 

Boilermakers rallied, securing 
a grueling first set, 26-24. 

Looking to avoid falling into 

an 0-2 hole for the second night 
in a row, Michigan quickly 
took control of the second 
set. As Michigan built a 10-7 
lead early in the set, Purdue 
outside hitter Maddy Chinn 
rose up and slammed the ball 
for what seemed to be a sure 
kill. However, Mruzik met 
her at the summit, viciously 
rejecting the attempt for a 
marquee block that won the 
point. These types of plays 
from Mruzik have been key for 
the Wolverines in high-impact 
situations.

“Jess has the advantage of 

coming in with the experience 
level that very few freshmen 
have, playing on a national team 
in the world championships,” 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
said. “So we’re not surprised. 
I don’t really think of her as a 
freshman.” 

Following 
the 
play, 
the 

Wolverines built on their lead 
with a flurry of kills from Jones, 
as the Boilermakers struggled to 
find answers for her on defense. 

“It 
helps 
when 
I 
have 

passers next to me who have 
been passing great,” Jones 
said. “We’ve played two games 

but they’re playing great so far. 
We’re still figuring out that 
connection.” 

With Michigan up 22-14, the 

Boilermakers began to mount a 
counterattack, resulting in a 7-0 
run which was quieted by junior 

middle blocker Kayla Bair to end 
a 7-0 with a dominant kill. At set 
point, 24-21, Cleveland looked 
to make the Wolverines pay for 
relinquishing the earlier lead with 
a large attempt. Mruzik, known 
for her offensive ability, once again 

turned defense into offense. Her 
monster block on Cleveland was 
unreturnable, and the Wolverines 
won set two. 

“We los(t) the first set and 

that can sometimes just kill 
momentum,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“I 

thought our players did an 
outstanding job of jumping out 
in the second set and being really 
resilient and aggressive and 
getting a big lead on them in the 
second set.”

Michigan 
was 
unable 
to 

carry 
the 
momentum 
into 

the 
following 
sets, 
though. 

Cleveland got into a rhythm, and 
the Boilermakers notched a .500 
hitting percentage to run away 
with the third set, 25-13. 

In the final set, creative 

no-look taps over the net from 
Purdue 
setter 
Hayley 
Bush 

confused 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense. 
The 
inconsistent 

communication, along with yet 
another .500 hitting percentage 
on the set from the Boilermakers, 
was too much for Michigan — 
which hit just .197 for the match 
— to handle as they lost the final 
set, 25-18. 

Despite the loss, Rosen looked 

to keep things in perspective, 
as the Wolverines opened their 
season against a key conference 
foe, taking the court for the first 
time since last March. 

“It was good to get back to 

some normalcy.” Rosen said. “It’s 
been an emotional rollercoaster, 
but to finally get going yesterday 
and have two matches this 
weekend was awesome.”

Just under nine minutes into 

the Michigan hockey team’s 
game against No. 7 Wisconsin 
on Sunday, Badgers’ forward 
Dylan Holloway had a half-
step on Wolverines’ sophomore 
defenseman Keaton Pehrson. 

Holloway had just received 

a pass from forward Roman 
Ahcan, who, with a quick cut to 
the right on a clean zone entry, 
opened up space for Holloway 
to sneak in behind the Michigan 
defense. 

Holloway buried the shot, 

notching the game’s first goal 
and helping to propel Wisconsin 
(14-8 overall, 12-6 Big Ten) to a 
3-2 victory over the Wolverines 
(11-7, 9-7). Alongside phenom 
forward Cole Caufield, Holloway 
anchored the Badgers in a game 
mostly dictated by the wealth of 
top talents on both sides. 

“They’re elusive, they’re really 

good hockey players,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “It 
doesn’t take much for them, to 
give them open space to create 
some things. On Holloway’s first 
goal, we let them skate through 
the neutral zone and back our 
defensemen off. We didn’t do 
a good job putting some back 
pressure on him and forcing the 
play.”

That goal broke the tie in a 

game that, until then, had been 
relatively mundane offensively. 
Still, the two shots Wisconsin 
notched in the first half of the 
period — a 2-on-1 where forward 
Linus Weissbach deferred to 
Caufield, and Holloway’s goal 
— illustrated how the Badgers 
planned to use their best players 
to 
attack 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense. 

Though mostly inactive in the 

first two periods, Michigan’s 
offense also ran through its 
top young talents. Its first goal 
exemplified this — freshman 
defenseman Owen Power scored 
on some nifty dekes off assists 

from freshman forwards Kent 
Johnson and Thomas Bordeleau, 
all past or projected first-round 
draft picks. 

But while the Wolverines 

struggled to sustain any offense, 
Wisconsin’s 
stars 
continued 

to apply pressure on the man 
advantage. With Caufield and 
Holloway together on a power-
play unit, the Badgers easily 
generated offense when up a 
man, ultimately resulting in a 
second-period power-play goal 
for Ahcan, with Holloway on the 
secondary assist. 

“They were moving the puck 

quick, and I think (with) Caufield 
and Holloway on the wings, it’s 
tough to defend,” Pearson said. 
“I just think overall, those guys, 
you gotta respect their shot, and 
at the end of the day, we just 
gotta be better.” 

Early in the third period, 

Wisconsin forward Dominick 
Mersch deflected a puck in front 
to extend the Badgers’ lead to 
two, effectively putting the 
game out of reach despite a late 
Michigan goal from freshman 
forward Brendan Brisson. 

If anything, Brisson’s goal will 

likely just make the loss sting 
more for the Wolverines. To 
leave the weekend with a series 
sweep against one of the Big 
Ten’s top teams would have been 
a massive statement — especially 
coming off a three-week hiatus 
from games. 

Still, escaping with a series 

split is an overall positive result 
for Michigan moving forward. 
Barring a pair of late-season 
collapses, 
the 
Wolverines 

and Badgers are both in solid 
position to make the postseason. 
With the talent they each have, 
they should also be poised 
to cause some headaches for 
whichever teams they go up 
against.

In the end, those teams will 

face the same dilemma Michigan 
faced Sunday:

“They 
have 
so 
many 

weapons,” Pearson said. “Who 
do you defend?”

Senior midfielder Sarah Stratigakis will be integral to Michigan’s success this season holding down the middle of the pitch against opponents.

ALEC COHEN/Daily 

Michigan senior Paige Jones kept the Wolverines in the match through her defense, but ultimately came up short.

Usually when the Michigan 

women’s soccer team takes 
the field to kick off a new 
season, they’re facing a non-
conference opponent. Usually 
they haven’t had six months 
to bond and practice, usually 
there isn’t snow on the ground.

But even in the face of new 

frontiers, the Wolverines want 
to “raise it” this season, a 
motto that guides the team to 
elevate its performance after 
losing in the third round of 
the NCAA Championship last 
season to eventual runner-up 
North Carolina.

“This year is about going 

that one little bit farther than 
we did last year, that one extra 
run at the end of the game 
when you’re not really wanting 
to do it,” junior Meredith 
Haakenson said. “When people 
look at us, let’s raise the level 
that they see.”

With 
many 
of 
its 
top 

performers 
returning 
— 

including 
senior 
Sarah 

Stratigakis, 
the 
2019 
Big 

Ten midfielder of the year — 
Michigan will likely rely on its 
experience to make it back to 
the NCAA tournament.

Not knowing if they would 

even have a season when 
training began in the fall, 
the 
Wolverines 
used 
that 

time to build technical and 
tactical skills to match their 
experience. While the two-
week 
athletics 
pause 
that 

ended Feb. 7 impacted the 

way the team prepared, coach 
Jennifer Klein and her players 
feel their work has helped 
them stay in game shape.

“A lot of credit has to go to 

our young women and them 
keeping themselves in a good 
place this entire time and just 
being hungry and ready for 
when we get an opportunity to 
compete against an opponent 
other than ourselves,” Klein 
said.

That chance will come this 

Saturday as the Wolverines 
travel to Columbus to take on 
rival Ohio State, their first 
game since Nov. 24, 2019. 
Starting an 11-game Big Ten 
season, Michigan could build 
off of last season’s conference 
success that saw it lose only 
two Big Ten games.

Those 
losses 
came 
at 

the hands of Rutgers and 
Wisconsin, 
both 
of 
whom 

shut 
out 
the 
Wolverines. 

Returning 
offensive 
talents 

like Stratigakis and Haakenson 
could help prevent that from 
repeating with another year of 
experience under their belts.

Offensive production stems 

from more than just those 
two, however. Haakenson said 
scoring is a team effort. Players 
like junior Raleigh Loughman 
or sophomore Danielle Wolfe 
can generate scoring for the 
Wolverines as they use their 
positioning to create chances. 
Wolfe scored seven goals last 
season while Loughman added 
six herself.

Scoring goals will help the 

Wolverines this season, but 
Michigan wants to improve its 

skills on both sides of the ball. 
Assistant coach Katie Hultin 
will continue working with the 
Wolverines on their defensive 
skills, something Klein and the 
players are thankful for.

Another 
asset 
for 
the 

Wolverines comes between the 
pipes as last season’s starting 
goaltender Hillary Beall will 
return for her senior season. 
Beall started all 24 games for 
Michigan last season, posting 
a 17-6-1 record and allowing 
around a goal per game. 

Solid defensive play factored 

into the team’s training this 
fall, but Beall could be an 
X-factor 
when 
opponents 

inevitably get good chances. In 
a close, defensive conference 
like the Big Ten, having that 
last line of defense can make or 
break teams.

With all the Wolverines 

were able to improve on, they 
cannot impact the way their 
opponents play. They will need 
to remain sharp against teams 
like Rutgers, Wisconsin and 
Penn State if they want to raise 
the bar this year.

The 
addition 
of 
seven 

freshmen this fall could prove 
useful against difficult foes. 
With around six months to 
acclimate to the college level, 
those 
players 
could 
make 

their presence felt more than 
a normal fall season would 
allow. 

“I give all the credit to 

them,” 
Haakenson 
said. 

“They’ve done a great job of 
just coming in, knowing the 
expectations, where they’re 
at, where we expect them to 

be and really getting to know 
them on and off the field.”

That depth could be essential 

if the Wolverines want to 
reach their goals of winning 
the 
conference 
tournament 

and returning to the NCAA 
tournament.

With only 11 games to prove 

to 
the 
NCAA 
tournament 

selectors 
that 
their 
squad 

belongs, 
the 
Wolverines 

need to be sharp from the 
first kickoff. Without non-
conference games to compare 
itself to the country’s best, 
Michigan can’t afford a bad 
start.

Road games against teams 

like Ohio State and Penn State 
could be crucial for the team 
to differentiate itself from its 
conference foes. With a 5-1 
record in Big Ten road games 
last 
year, 
the 
Wolverines 

will focus on increasing that 
recent success.

“It’s a business trip,” Klein 

said. “We’ve got to go in and 
try to keep some of the same 
rhythms and habits that we do 
at a home game.”

That mentality will have to 

be extended to home games 
as well. The Wolverines will 
play some home games at 
Brighton’s 
Legacy 
Center 

because they lack an indoor 
facility.

Michigan knows how much 

work went into the season 
amid a pandemic. Now, as 
Team 27 prepares to take 
the field in Columbus, the 
Wolverines want to use those 
efforts as motivation to raise 
their performance.

Michigan bests Nebraska in 

first meet after pause

Livers at forefront of Michigan’s success

The instant that junior Natalie 

Wojcik powerfully stuck the 

landing of her dismount from 

the balance beam, Michigan 

gymnastics coach Bev Plocki’s 

arms both shot like rockets into 

the air with palms open and 

fingers spread. 

A perfect 10, she visually 

proclaimed for all to see.

“She is so beautiful in that 

event, and we have judged her at 

a 10 so many times in practice,” 

Plocki said. “And it’s so amazing 

to see her put together that 

routine. When she stuck the 

dismount, she didn’t give the 

judges any opportunity to take 

anything. So I knew that it had to 

be a 10.”

The judges table did not 

disappoint and awarded Wojcik 

with a full 10 points, adding the 

exclamation point to a dominant 

win for the No. 8 Wolverines over 

Nebraska on Monday afternoon.

Michigan’s 197.650 to 195.300 

win was expected, but it also 

answered a lot of open questions 

regarding the Wolverines’ form 

following the University’s 14-day 

practice pause and the team’s 

24-day break from competition.

Michigan 
impressed 
many 

with a win over then-No. 4 

Minnesota on Jan. 22, but a multi-

week stoppage posed to halt its 

momentum.

The Wolverines made sure 

they picked up where they left off.

“I give a lot of credit to our 

captains and the athletes, they’re 

very motivated,” Plocki said. “We 

have tried very hard to focus on the 

things that we’re grateful for. And 

we’re grateful for the opportunity 

to have the support resources that 

we did to help us and guide us 

with some of our conditioning and 

our to help our bodies (while we 

couldn’t be together). And when 

we came back, we were able to put 

together a practice plan to ease 

them back into normal routines 

and just tried to build a lot of 

confidence and remind them how 

good they are and what they’re 

capable of doing.”

Michigan came out strong and 

never looked back, winning each 

round, convincingly.

***

The meet began with Michigan 

on vault and Nebraska on bars.

Every Wolverine who vaulted 

earned a score of at least 9.800, 

with Wojcik and junior Abby 

Brenner earning high scores of 

9.875 and 9.900, respectively. 

Meanwhile, 
the 
Cornhuskers 

struggled on the bars with only 

junior Kynsee Roby earning 

above a 9.775.

Michigan 
ended 
the 
first 

round with a lead of 49.375 to 

48.900, and the margin only grew 

from there.

Nebraska’s scores improved on 

the vault as the teams swapped 

events 
in 
round 
two 
with 

freshman Danielle Press earning 

a noteworthy 9.875, but twin 

9.900’s from Brenner and Wojcik 

on the bars served to quell any 

thoughts of a comeback. 

This 
trend 
continued 
in 

the third round, when Wojcik 

earned her 10.000 on the beam, 

effectively ending the match 

before the final round even 

began. 

“I have been working to earn 

the perfect 10 for such a long time 

now, and I’m so happy to have 

made that happen,” Wojcik said. 

“The best part of it, by far, was 

seeing my teammates jumping 

up and down after I finished my 

routine and getting to celebrate it 

with them.”

Wojcik’s 
words 
are 
very 

fitting in a match that was 

a celebration of team unity. 

Monday was the Wolverines’ 

annual “Flip for Chip” meet, 

which sees the team honor the 

late father of former Michigan 

gymnast Cailee Hills. 

“Chip Hills really is the root 

of our positive mindsets, our 

resilience 
and 
confidence,” 

sophomore Gabby Wilson said. 

“And so really being able to 

channel his energy, even though 

he isn’t with us, just being able to 

carry that and continue that for 

generations at Michigan is super 

important and was continued 

tonight.” 

There is perhaps no meet 

where the attitude the Wolverines 

take from Hills’s legacy could be 

more appropriate. 

Coming 
off 
less-than-ideal 

circumstances in which some 

worried about rust, Michigan 

responded with a perfect 10.000 

and an event sweep — a textbook 

display of resilience.

Isaiah Livers knew it would happen. 

The Michigan men’s basketball team 

had gone 23 days between games 

and two weeks without so much as 

touching a basketball. Inevitably, 

when the Wolverines returned, the 

discourse would revolve around any 

alleged rust. 

So, Livers took the initiative to 

try to avoid any side effects of the 

prolonged break.

“That’s why I was outside, doing 

jump 
ropes, 
doing 
everything 

necessary to stay in shape,” the senior 

forward said. “A lot of other guys 

were too. We had a program, we all 

stayed true to it. … We didn’t want to 

have any built-in excuses.” 

In 
Sunday’s 
emphatic 
67-59 

comeback victory against Wisconsin, 

those efforts paid dividends with 

Livers setting the tone. Through the 

first 20 minutes, the team’s rust was 

evident. Michigan looked the part of 

a team that last played on Jan. 22, its 

first half performance littered with 

mental errors, poor shot selection and 

jellied legs. Livers, though, did what 

he could to help keep the Wolverines 

afloat, scoring 13 of Michigan’s 27 first 

half points. 

“I knew I was gonna come out and 

be aggressive cause I wanted to keep 

in that rhythm,” Livers said. “But 

other than that, I just wanted to lead 

my team.” 

He did exactly that. By the time 

the final buzzer blared, Livers had 

contributed a game-high 20 points 

on 8-of-16 from the field and 4-of-7 

from beyond the arc. He added seven 

rebounds and finished as a plus-11, 

the second-highest mark on the team. 

At this point, 111 games and 91 

wins into what is fast becoming an 

illustrious collegiate career, this 

level of play has become routine for 

Livers. He has notched 20 points in 

three consecutive games and scored 

double-figures in seven straight. 

Ho-hum. 

“We keep it simple,” Wolverines’ 

coach Juwan Howard said of his 

team’s offensive strategy against the 

Badgers. “We kept it simple. Simple 

plays.” 

No one embodies that philosophy 

more so than Livers. Livers’s points 

come within the flow of the game. 

Rarely does he force up an ill-advised 

shot or hoard the ball on an isolation. 

On a Michigan offense overflowing 

with talent, Livers has found the 

perfect balance. 

“I took advantage of that tonight,” 

Livers said. “I was just doing with 

what the system tells me to do. Coach 

Howard puts me in a spot to score, I 

go score the ball. If not, then I try to 

create for someone else, create so they 

can get a shot, get a drive.” 

Livers has made drastic strides 

to his offensive game since the 

COVID-19 pandemic cut his junior 

campaign short. He has increased his 

production while also sharpening his 

efficiency. Last year, Livers averaged 

12.9 points per game on 9.9 shot 

attempts. This year, he’s scoring 15.1 

points per game on 10.5 attempts. He 

is shooting 49% from the field and a 

lethal 46% from deep, compared to 

45% and 40% last season. 

Livers’s refined repertoire also 

features a blend of jump shots 

and points in the paint. When the 

Wolverines stared down a 12-point 

halftime deficit on Sunday, Livers 

recognized that he needed to 

emphasize the latter. 

“They were the most aggressive 

team in the first half,” Livers said. 

“We had to come back out in the 

second half, we had to drive them. I 

thought we settled for a lot of shots. 

We got to the basket more in the 

second half and that kind of changed 

momentum.” 

It’s no coincidence, then, that Livers 

notched the first basket of the second 

half on an off-ball cut, slicing down the 

lane and receiving a pass in stride for 

an easy lay-in. Livers treated the layoff 

as a quasi-All Star Break, using the 

time to look in the mirror. He poured 

over reams of film, re-evaluating his 

performance and searching for ways 

to improve alongside assistant coach 

Saddi Washington. 

“Just kind of tips and advice, 

opinions so when I get back, I can 

just add it to my game,” Livers said 

on Friday. “I want to help my team 

as best as possible, especially in the 

future.” 

One area for potential improvement 

that Livers and Washington found 

was on the glass. Though Livers is 

averaging a career-high 6.1 rebounds 

per game — up from 4.0 last year — he 

aspired for more. 

Against Wisconsin, the 6-foot-

7 Livers grabbed seven rebounds, 

besting a stout Badgers frontcourt of 

6-foot-11 Nate Reuvers and 6-foot-10 

Micah Potter. The duo combine for 

nearly 10 rebounds a game, yet neither 

managed to grab a rebound on Sunday. 

After the game, much was made in 

the press conference about the team’s 

turnaround and freshman center 

Hunter Dickinson’s latest 15-rebound, 

five-block spectacle. There was little 

mention of Livers. But perhaps that’s 

the point. For Livers, at this stage in 

his career, this is just another day at 

the office. 

And as the Wolverines continue 

to assert themselves as bona fide 

championship contenders, they can 

rely on Livers to lead the way.

Isaiah Livers’s consistency has played a pivotal role in Michigan’s success this season.

In comeback win, Michigan shows its championship mettle

MADISON — Shutdowns in college bas-

ketball may be a temporary phenomenon, but 

enough of them have happened by now for an 

expectation to form. Teams come out lacking 

offensive 
sharpness. 

Their shooting touch is 

gone. Defensively, they 

miss assignments. After 

all, no one has ever pre-

scribed sitting locked in 

an apartment for 14 days 

as an effective midsea-

son practice strategy. 

And for the open-

ing 20 minutes Sunday 

afternoon at the Kohl Center, Michigan was 

no exception. In the first half, the Wolverines 

shot an anemic 34.4% from the field. Their 

offensive strategy seemed to consist of passing 

the ball around for 20 seconds and then letting 

someone play hero ball. Only senior forward 

Isaiah Livers was remotely effective in the 

role. On defense, they made Wisconsin look 

like the antithesis of the team that lost, 77-54, 

in Ann Arbor a month ago.

To put it simply, Michigan looked pret-

ty normal. Losing on the road to a top-25 

team after not playing a game in 23 days 

isn’t a crime. Clemson — an excellent, 13-5 

team — lost its first three games after its 

COVID-19 outbreak by an average of 24 

points. 12-4 Oregon lost its first two games 

back to a pair of teams that rank outside of 

the top 100 in KenPom’s adjusted efficien-

cy metric.

But this Michigan team isn’t normal. It’s a 

national championship contender. Anything 

less than a Final Four appearance would be 

a disappointment. That’s the statement the 

Wolverines made Sunday afternoon.

“I’m grateful, I’m blessed to be on a team 

like this,” Livers said. “Coach (Juwan) How-

ard kinda touched on it, he talked about how 

it’s just special to have guys who go on a pause 

and then come back, go on the road to Wis-

consin, who’s playing great right now, and just 

be locked in and be together. I think we’re the 

most connected team.”

A month ago, it was Livers who called 

this iteration of Michigan his “favorite” that 

he’s been a part of. Livers, if you’ve lost track, 

was on the team that finished as national 

runner-up in 2018. A year later, he and the 

Wolverines started 17-0 — the best mark in 

program history.

So when Livers, of all people, says this team 

is special, you listen. 

You listen and then you watch. You 

watch them outscore Wisconsin by 20 in 

the second half. You watch them identi-

fy their issues in the space of a 15-minute 

halftime break and come out an entirely 

different team. You watch them in a situ-

ation they’ve seldom been in — tied with 

five minutes to go — and handle it like it’s 

a weekly occurrence.

Through it all, you realize you’re watching 

a team answer the one question it hadn’t been 

asked: How well does it handle adversity?

“Winning a game like this on the road does 

a lot,” Howard said. “It says a lot about the 

character of this group.”

More importantly, it says a lot about its 

March credentials. From here on out, adver-

sity is inescapable. On the schedule in the last 

five games of the season are No. 4 Ohio State 

and No. 15 Iowa. Last week’s cancellation 

against No. 6 Illinois will likely be resched-

uled, too. All three are in the KenPom top 10.

After that comes the small matter of the 

NCAA Tournament. Only one team in the 

past decade has won a national championship 

without a single-digit scare in the dance.

On Sunday, Michigan proved that such 

nerve-wracking games won’t phase it.

“I think this was a great experience for us,” 

freshman center Hunter Dickinson said. “We 

haven’t had too many close games, usually 

they’re 10 points or more. I think this will be 

really beneficial to us at the postseason when 

the games are not as separated in points.”

So no, Michigan still hasn’t played a top-10 

adjusted efficiency team. And yes, its three 

biggest challenges of the regular season may 

lie ahead. But what it has done is overcome a 

situation it hadn’t faced all season. And that’s 

enough to call these Wolverines national 

championship contenders.

LUKE HALE/Daily

By defeating Wisconsin on the road after a 23-day break, Michigan solidified itself as a championship contender.


Entering his fourth season as the 

head coach of the Michigan men’s 

lacrosse team, Kevin Conry is gradu-

ally building off the foundation laid by 

his predecessor, John Paul. After reeling 

in the No. 4 and No. 3 recruiting classes 

in 2020 and 2021, respectively, Conry 

is hungry to shake up the Big Ten with 

a Wolverine squad that is quietly yet 

quickly ascending.

Finding a replacement for Paul, 

the human embodiment of Michigan 

lacrosse, was no simple task for ath-

letic director Warde Manuel.

Nevertheless, on June 21, 2017, 

just six weeks after he declared 

Paul wouldn’t be returning, Manuel 

announced that Maryland assistant 

head coach and defensive coordinator 

Kevin Conry would serve as the Wol-

verines’ next head coach. 

Coming from a perennially stout 

Terrapins’ organization that defeat-

ed Ohio State in the NCAA cham-

pionship game that season and had 

won the Big Ten the past three sea-

sons, Conry brought a track record 

of winning at the Division I level that 

appealed to an up-and-coming pro-

gram like Michigan. And as a Long 

Island native who played college 

lacrosse at Johns Hopkins, Conry had 

deep East Coast roots that would help 

the Wolverines recruit, bolster their 

coaching staff and enhance their 

understanding of the game.

In tandem with the completion of 

U-M Lacrosse Stadium — a brand-

new, lavish complex featuring a 2,000-

seat stadium, an indoor turf room and 

direct passage into a 20,000-square-

foot strength and conditioning center 

— Conry’s arrival set Michigan up for a 

new era. He was someone who Manu-

el thought could turn the corner.

“(He was) different enough from 

me in so many ways that I think (was) 

a good thing,” Paul said. “It (could) 

kinda jumpstart the program in a 

different direction, which I think 

any time you have a coaching change, 

that’s what you need. Really a kick in 

the ass from a different direction.”

But Conry also respected the 

immense utility of Paul’s legacy and 

culture that he had spent so many 

years developing. During the transi-

tion period, the pair had an amica-

ble relationship. While Paul taught 

Conry how to navigate the com-

plexities of the University and form 

relationships with a proper support-

ing cast of Wolverine faculty, Conry 

worked to build on many of the core 

elements Paul had already woven into 

the team’s fabric.

“It was certainly encouraging, 

because you know when someone 

invests their heart and soul and so 

much time into something, you know 

it’s gonna be trending positively,” 

Conry said. “It was a really solid foun-

dation that we could springboard 

(from) and really continue to develop 

the championship culture that we 

were putting together. … As we tran-

sitioned in, we continued that growth 

process, but we were confident that 

we had a really strong baseline to 

build off of.”

Under Conry, the synergy of utiliz-

ing new and old team values seeming-

ly paid dividends.

In 2018, having retained many of 

their key roster pieces from the year 

prior, the Wolverines picked up where 

they left off, once again finishing 8-6. 

Despite stumbles against ranked 

opponents early on the season, drop-

ping matchups to the No. 18 Penn and 

No. 11 Yale, Michigan later picked up 

signature wins over the No. 4 Notre 

Dame on the road and the No. 14 Penn 

State in an overtime thriller. In both 

contests, the Wolverines set major 

milestones, earning their first wins 

over a top-five program and a ranked 

Big Ten program, respectively.

As Conry made his transition in his 

first year with Michigan, he benefited 

tremendously from the support, pro-

duction and leadership of its veteran 

players. According to Conry, seniors 

like midfielders PJ Bogle and Parker 

McKee fully embraced the uncer-

tainty that a coaching change brought 

and served as blank pages for Conry 

to work with. 

“The best teams coach themselves,” 

Conry said. “If you wanna have a suc-

cessful championship team, you have 

seniors that buy in, know what they’re 

doing and can keep the rest of the team 

not just in line, but also encourage 

them to do the right things and to have 

that positive leadership.”

On the playing field, Brent Nose-

worthy had a record-setting junior 

season. Notching 48 points on a 

whopping 41 goals, he surpassed 

King’s short-lived record for points in 

a season and led the Big Ten with 2.93 

goals per game. By Noseworthy’s side, 

Curran recorded 31 points and helped 

mentor then-freshman attackmen 

Kevin Mack and Alex Buckanavage.

“Not only (were) they invested 

enough to understand what they 

(needed) to do, but they (could) teach 

somebody else and help them grow 

as well,” Conry said. “(Noseworthy 

was) gonna go out and shoot an extra 

bucket of balls. He (was) gonna take 

somebody with him. And that’s real-

ly where good teams become great 

teams and cusp teams become cham-

pionship teams.”

***

Although 2018 set the stage for a 

positive future, the Wolverines took a 

step back in 2019. 

Plagued by injuries in several piv-

otal areas, including on the defensive 

front and at the faceoff X, Michigan 

struggled to slow down its opponents 

and win important possessions all 

season long, giving up 13.46 goals per 

game and losing 67.6 of its faceoffs. 

On the offensive end, the Wolverines 

missed the goal-scoring capabili-

ties of Noseworthy, who missed five 

games due to injury.

Michigan limped into its season 

finale against No. 10 Ohio State with 

a meager 3-9 record.

Heading into the contest, the Wol-

verines were evidently underdogs. 

But rallying behind a now-healthy 

Noseworthy and other seniors like 

Curran and Second Team All-Big Ten 

defenseman Nick DeCaprio, Michigan 

was motivated to end the otherwise 

disappointing season on a high note by 

defeating its rival for the first time.

“I was really proud of the fight in 

those guys,” Conry said. “When we 

had the injuries, we had to adapt and 

change. … Walk out there and say, 

‘Hey, we still have a game to play. We 

gotta be successful.’ ”

Bolstered by four assists in the first 

half by Buckanavage, a single-game 

team record, the Wolverines sur-

prisingly skirted out to an 8-4 lead at 

halftime. Just over halfway through 

the third quarter, Noseworthy netted 

the 100th goal of his career — the first 

Michigan player to do so — to extend 

the Wolverines’ lead. Although the 

Buckeyes closed the deficit to two 

with 10 minutes remaining, a subse-

quent pair of goals from Noseworthy 

secured the monumental win for 

Michigan, 13-10.

In a difficult season that drastical-

ly differed from the one preceding it, 

2019 taught Conry and his players a 

lot about adversity.

“Handling success is something 

that’s really important,” Conry said. 

“You walk through the door, your 

last game’s a win, and you say, ‘Okay, 

yeah, have we made it?’ I think that 

knowledge of, ‘Why did we become 

successful? What got us there?’ — that 

was the biggest lesson of 2019. No 

matter what happens, we gotta get up 

in the morning and gotta look at our-

selves in the mirror and say, ‘Are we 

prepared to be successful today? Are 

we ready to put the work in to do so?’ 

We learned and grew throughout the 

year in order to do that.” 

Heading into 2020 with healthy 

legs and new faces, the Wolverines 

looked to take this newfound wis-

dom, redeem themselves and move 

forward as a program. They wouldn’t 

have the opportunity to fully do that 

though. On Mar. 11, Michigan nar-

rowly defeated Marquette, 13-12, to 

move to 4-3 in a befuddling season 

that had featured an impressive dis-

play of grit against the No. 5 Bulldogs, 

but also a stunning loss to freshly-pro-

moted Merrimack.

Little did the Wolverines know at 

the time, though, that they had played 

the last Michigan sporting event to 

occur for the next seven months.

Just a day later, the NCAA canceled 

the remainder of all winter and spring 

sports seasons due to the COVID-

19 pandemic, which was worsening 

by the day. Just like that, the world 

of sports turned upside down as the 

country went into lockdown. 

On May 18, Furman University 

announced its intention to cut its varsity 

men’s lacrosse and baseball programs 

due to the financial impact of COVID-

19. Before long, schools across the coun-

try revealed similar plans to cut some of 

their non-revenue sports as well, most 

frequently smaller programs like gym-

nastics, tennis and swimming. 

For a moment in time, as a young 

and developing program, everything 

the Wolverines had ever been work-

ing toward seemed to hang in limbo.
