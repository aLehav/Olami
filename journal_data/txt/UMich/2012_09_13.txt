One year after
0 implementation,
number of smokers
has decreased
By KATIE SYZMANSKI
Daily StaffReporter
Since the University banned
smoking on campus in July 2011,
officials say they have seen a
decrease in smoking among stu-
dents, faculty and staff, and a
generally cleaner and healthier
campus environment.
Robert Winfield, co-chair
of the Smoke-Free University
Steering Committee and the
University's chief health officer,
said he has noticed a decrease
in smoking on campus since the
smoke-free policy was enacted
last summer.
Winfield referenced the Uni-
versity's annual Student Life
0 Survey -,which -collects data
through the Substance Abuse
Research Center - to solid-
ify the claim that smoking is
decreasing on campus as a result
of the ban.
The most recent data from

Winfield said the on-campus

Democrat Mark
Bernstein uses
school bus to help
tout campaign
By CHANNING ROBINSON
Daily StaffReporter
Elections for University
governing boards are typically
low-profile races, but Mark
Bernstein, a Democratic can-
didate for University regent,
has drawn attention to himself
by traversing the state in the
Bernstein Bus.
To inform voters about his
policies, Bernstein has trav-
eled everywhere from Ann
Arbor to the Upper Peninsula
in a school bus covered in
logos such as "Keep College
Affordable" and "Higher Edu-
cation, Lower Cost" designed
to promote himself to pro-
spective voters.
Bernstein said the bus has
drawn the interest of many
Michigan residents.
"I thought the bus was
going to be good, but it has far
exceeded my expectations,"
Bernstein said. "I expected
the bus to be a home run and
it's been a grand slam. The bus
is proving to be an extremely
effective vehicle to communi-

cate the primary message of
our campaign ... we are run-
ning to protect the promise of
public education and public
university."
Regents serve eight-year
terms at the University. While
all members were eligible
for re-election, two seats on
the board will be open, as
incumbents S. Martin Tay-
lor (D-Grosse Pointe Farms)
and Olivia Maynard (D-Ann
Arbor) decided not to run in
November. In February, Taylor
and Maynard told The Michi-
gan Daily that they plan to
reallocate their time to family
affairs and community work.
"It was wonderful to have
served and I think (the Univer-
sity) is being left in even better
shape," Taylor said in Febru-
ary.
Bernstein is one of two
Democrats vying for the open
regents seats, after officially
being nominated at Michi-
gan's state convention Sept.
8-9, along with Shauna Ryder
Diggs, a dermatologist and
University alum.
They willbe running against
GOP candidates Rob Steele,

ologist and Dan Horning, who

Subcommittees
decry graduate

unionization
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Congressional Republicans
were highly critical of efforts at
Universities across the country
to organize graduate students as
two subcommittees held hear-
ings on the subject Wednesday.

The House Higher Educa-
tion and Workforce Training
subcommittee and the House
Health, Employment, Labor,
and Pensions subcommittee dis-
cussed cases pending before the
National Labor Relations Board.
Deans from two universities
and an AFL-CIO representative
also spoke at the hearing as wit-
nesses.
The NLRB is currently recon-
sidering its 2004 ruling which
deemed graduate students at
private universities unable to
unionize.
U.S. Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.),

chairman of the health sub-
committee, said the NLRB is
essentially controlled by large
unions, and thus biased in favor
of unionization.
"The NLRB is utterly deter-
mined to advance a culture of
union favoritism," Roe said.
He continued to condemn
the NLRB's role in higher edu-
cation, adding that he believes
there could be "significant
changes" to the college system
if the NLRB allowed for union-
ization.

SISTER SISTER
_ KY :-

Facebook for scholars

Which course are you teach-
ing this semester and what
kind of material does it cover?
This semester I'm teaching
"Introduction to Information."
This course is about the incred-
ible role that information plays
in our lives, from how we under-
stand society (to) the economy
and social relationships. Infor-
mation is pervasive, and we've
all become not just consumers
of information, but producers as
well. In the course of this class,
we look at things like human-
computer interaction, social
media in collective action, infor-
mation economics, intellectual
property policy, information
visualization and more.

How would you describe
your teaching style?
I think in a word, I'd describe
it as playful. I want the top-
ics I teach to be engaging and
relevant, and for the students
to think about the process by
which information is delivered
in the classroom, not just outside
of it.
What do you think about
the prevalence of social media
in today's culture?
It's my primary research
area, and I've published many
papers and given many talks on
the subject. My (thought) on the
subject is that there's an inter-
esting intersection between

social systems and the technical
systems that currently are medi-
ating them. Social media and
related technologies are reduc-
ing the cost of creating, sharing,
and consuming huge amounts of
information, and that's likely to
affect us as a species over time.
What do you enjoy doing in
your free time?
As my students can tell you,
I'm a huge nerd. I dig comic
books, video games, science fic-
tion in all formats and Dungeons
& Dragons. I also like lifting
weights and spending time with
my wife. We're expecting our
first kid soon!

Nev. air race goes on one year
after deadly crash killed 11

Race adopted safety
czar, changes in
training pilots
RENO, Nev. (AP) - The vin-
tage World War II fighters roar-
ing out of the Valley of Speed
are as loud as ever, their colorful
paint jobs as bright as the enthu-
siasm of the loyal aviation buffs
who fill the grandstands in Reno.
But it's not exactly business as
usual at the 49th annual National
Championship Air Races, which
kick off this week. The element of
danger persists despite new safety
measures put in place after a P-51
Mustang took a deadly plunge
into spectators last year. Pilots
will still be flying souped-up
muscle planes wingtip to wingtip,
sometimes exceeding500 mph.
"We never thought this would
happen, but we know it's not
knitting," said Marilyn Dash, a
biplane pilot from the San Fran-
cisco Bay area. "It's not bowling.
"Nobody ever was killed bowl-
ing, were they?"

Race organizers adopted a half
dozen changes recommended by
theNational TransportationSafe-
ty Board following the crash last
September that killed 11 people,
including pilot Jimmy Leeward,
and injured more than 70 others.
A reminder of the danger
came Tuesday during qualifying
heats for the fastest planes when
the pilot of a vintage Hawker
Sea Fury was forced to make an
emergency landing. He escaped
uninjured after the hard landing
kicked up a cloud of dust visible
from the grandstands.
The qualifying heat resumed in
the unlimited class, where two-
time national champion Steve
Hinton Jr. posted the top speed of
493 mph earlier in the day.
But there are differences from
last year. The course is now more
than 1,000 feet from the grand-
stand, instead of 850; fuel trucks
are set away from the landing
strip; and the final turn of the race
is less sharp.
Some changes are more notice-
able than others. The impact cra-
ter from last year's crash on the

edge of the tarmac that has been
paved over with asphalt, and the
race officially changed its name
to "TravelNevada.com National
Championship Air Races and Air
Show presented by Breitling."
The new name is the result of a
one-time, $600,000 sponsorship
the state tourism commission
extended as necessary to keeping
the event alive in the face of soar-
ing insurance premiums.
Race organizers hope the
most significant changes will be
behind-the-scenes, in training
classes intended to better prepare
pilots for intense gravitational
pull and wake turbulence, and
along pit row, where mechanics
will be subject to a new inspection
process that requires follow-up
confirmation that ordered repairs
actually get done - a possible
contributor to Leeward's demise.
"It really seems about the
same," Eric Zine, a pilot from Van
Nuys, Calif. "There's increased
focus on safety. But we're doing
stuff people don't do. It's not nor-
mal to try to make a plane go fast-
er than it's designed to go."

A military judge has rejected

ruling released Wednesday that
he lacks authority to grant such

The judge, Army Col. James
Pohl, said the rules for military

the proceedings. He noted that
broadcast coverage is similarly

Gov't releases
documents
detailing deaths of
96 spectators
LONDON (AP) - British
police tried to blame soccer
fans to cover up mistakes that
contributed to the deaths of 96
supporters who were crushed
at a stadium in 1989, according
to secret documents released
Wednesday following a lengthy
campaign by families of the vic-
tims.
Prime Minister David Cam-
eron apologized for Britain's
worst sports disaster and said
the country had been shamed by
its failure for more than 20 years
to disclose the errors that helped
lead to the death of Liverpool
fans at Hillsborough stadiun,
most of whom were crushed and
suffocated in a standing-room-
only section.
A government-appointed
panel that reviewed the papers
confirmed failures by police led
directly to the disaster and that
some injured fans were denied
medical treatment that could
have saved their lives, he said.
Police officers herded around
2,000 Liverpool fans into caged-
in enclosures that were already
full during an FA Cup semifinal
between Liverpool and Notting-
ham Forest on April 15, 1989, at
the stadium in Sheffield, central
England.
No individual or organization
has ever faced charges in con-
nection with the disaster.
Cameron said that evidence
contained in 400,000 pages of
previously undisclosed papers

turned over to the families of
the dead on Wednesday detailed
sophisticated attempts by police
to turn the blame for the disas-
ter onto the victims and to sully
their reputations by insinuat-
ing that many were drunken,
and had histories of violence or
criminality.
"New evidence that we are
presented with today makes
clear that these families have
suffered a double injustice,"
Cameron told the House of
Commons. "The injustice of the
appalling events, the failure of
the state to protect their loved
ones and the indefensible wait to
get to the truth, and the injustice
ofthedenigrationofthe deceased
- that they were somehow at
fault for their own deaths."
. "On behalf of the govern-
ment - and indeed our country
- I am profoundly sorry for this
double injustice that has been
left uncorrected for so long," he
told legislators, many of whom
gasped audibly or wept as Cam-
eron discussed details of failures
by British authorities.
Though a report by the panel
said it was not possible to say
conclusively whether a better
response from emergency servic-
es could have saved specific indi-
viduals, panel member Dr. Bill
Kirkup told reporters that 41fans
had the "potentialto survive."
Cameron said that Attorney
General Dominic Grieve would
review the evidence and likely
apply to Britain's High Court to
overturn the verdict of an origi-
nal inquest hearing and order
a new hearing. An inquest jury
ruled in 1991 that the deaths
were accidental, but criticized
the local South Yorkshire Police
for its actions.

Tuesday's stunning attack
on the American Consulate in
Benghazi poses a daunting task
for U.S. and Libyan investiga-
tors: searching for the culprits in
-a city rife with heavy weapons,
multiple militias, armed Islamist
groups and little police control.
The one-story villa that serves
as the consulate was a burned-
out wreck after the crowd armed
with machine guns and rocket-
propelled grenades rampaged
through it. Slogans of "God is
great" and "Muhammad is God's
Prophet" were scrawled across
its scorched walls. Libyan civil-
ians strolled freely in charred
rooms with furniture and papers
strewn everywhere.
President Barack Obama
vowed in a Rose Garden address
that the U.S. would "work
with the Libyan government
to bring to justice" those who
killed Ambassador Chris Ste-
vens, information manager Sean

Smith and two other Americans
who were not identified. Three
other Americans were wounded.
Stevens was the first U.S.
ambassador killed in the line of
duty in 30 years.
"We reject all efforts to deni-
grate the religious beliefs of
others, but there is absolutely
no justification for this type
of senseless violence. None,"
said Obama, who also ordered
'increased security at U.S. diplo-
matic posts abroad.
Republican Mitt Romney
accused the Obama adminis-
tration of showing weakness in
the consulate killings, but the
president retorted that his rival
"seems to have a tendency to
shoot first and aim later." Some
in the GOP called Romney's
remarks hasty.
The mob attack on Tuesday
- the 11th anniversary of the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strike
in the U.S. - was initially pre-
sumed to have been a sponta-
neous act triggered by outrage
over a movie called "Inno-
cence of Muslims" that mocked
Islam's Prophet Muhammad
that was produced in the U.S.
and excerpted on YouTube. The
amateurish video also drew
protests in Cairo, where angry
ultraconservatives climbed the
U.S. Embassy's walls, tore down
an American flag and replaced it
with an Islamic banner.
But a U.S. counterterrorism
official said the Benghazi vio-
lence was "too coordinated or
professional" to be spontaneous.
The official spoke on condition
of anonymity because he was not
authorized to discuss the inci-

dent publicly.
The FBI was sending evidence
teams to Libya, a law enforce-
ment official said.
Libya's new leadership -
scrambling to preserve ties
with Washington after U.S.
help to overthrow former dicta-
tor Moammar Gadhafi - vowed
to find those behind the attack.
Interim President Mohammed
el-Megarif apologized to the
United States for what he called
the "cowardly" assault, which
also killed several Libyan securi-
ty guards at the consulate in the
eastern city.
Parliament speaker Omar al-
Houmidan suggested the attack
might have been planned, saying
the mob "may have had foreign
loyalties" - an apparent refer-
ence to international terrorists.
"We are not sure. Everything is
possible," he said.
A Libyan jihadist group, the
Omar Abdel-Rahman Brigades,
claimed responsibilityfor abomb
that went off outside the Beng-
hazi consulate in June, causing
no injuries. The group, which
also carried out several attacks
on the International Red Cross
in Libya, said at the time that the
bomb was revenge for the killing
of al-Qaida's No. 2, Abu Yahya
al-Libi, in a U.S. drone strike in
Pakistan.
About 50 U.S. Marines were
sent to Libya to guard U.S. dip-
lomatic facilities. The Marines
are members of an elite group
known as a Fleet Antiterrorism
Security Team, or FAST, whose
role isto respond on short notice
to terrorism threats and to rein-
force security at embassies.

New York City soda ban
expected to be approved

Doctors say size
limit may improve
health, nutrition
NEW YORK (AP) - The era
of the supersized cola may come
to an end in New York City on
Thursday, when health offi-
cials are expected to approve
an unprecedented 16-ounce
limit on sodas and other sugary
drinks at restaurants, delis and
movie theaters. But will it actu-
ally translate into better health?
Doctors and nutrition
experts said the regulation's
success or failure may depend
on more than just the mod-
est number of calories it might
slash from people's diets. It will
hinge on whether the first-in-
the-nation rule starts a conver-
sation that changes attitudes
toward overeating.
"Ultimately it does come
down to culture, and it comes
down to taking some first steps,"

said Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, a
professor at the Mount Sinai
School of Medicine who has
studied the effect of govern-
ment regulation on the obesity
epidemic.
"There are so many factors
that are acting in this complex
disease. Obesity is not just a dis-
ease simply of people drinking
too much sugary soft drink," he
said. "Just attacking one thing,
individually, isn't going to do
much."
But if the rule is part of a
broader social and scientific
assault on the dangers of too
much sugar, he said, it could be
tremendously effective. He lik-
ened it to the drumbeat about
the dangers of smoking, which
took decades to translate into
results.
"People talk about it. It gets
ruminated at social parties. It
gets ruminated in politics and
the media. And all of a sudden,
you have an awareness," he
said.

California man confirms role in film

Anti-Muslim video
incited violence in
Libya, Egypt
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
search for those behind the pro-
vocative, anti-Muslim film impli-
cated in violent protests in Egypt
and Libya led Wednesday to a
California Coptic Christian con-
victed of financial crimes who
acknowledged his role in man-
aging and providing logistics for
the production.
Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55,
told The Associated Press in an
interview outside Los Angeles
that he was manager for the com-
pany that produced "Innocence
of Muslims,"which mocked Mus-
lims and the prophet Muhammad
and may have caused inflamed
mobs that attacked U.S. missions
in Egypt and Libya.
U.S. officials are investigating
whether the assault on the con-
sulate was a planned terrorist
strike to mark the anniversary of
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and not
spontaneous.
Nakoula provided the first
details about a shadowy produc-
tion group behind the film.
Nakoula denied he directed
the film and said he knew the
self-described filmmaker, Sam
Bacile. But the cellphone num-
ber that AP contacted Tuesday
to reach the filmmaker who

identified himself as Sam Bacile
traced to the same address near
Los Angeles where AP found
Nakoula. Federal court papers
said Nakoula's aliases included
Nicola Bacily, Erwin Salameh
and others.
Nakoula told the AP that he
was a Coptic Christian and said
the film's director supported
the concerns of Christian Copts
about their treatment by Mus-
lims.
Nakoula denied he had posed
as Bacile. During a conversation
outside his home, he offered his
driver's license to show his iden-
tity but kept his thumb over his
middle name, Basseley. Records
checks by the AP subsequently
found it and other connections
to the Bacile persona.
The AP located Bacile after
obtaining his cell phone number
from Morris Sadek, a conserva-
tive Coptic Christian in the U.S.
who had promoted the anti-
Muslim film in recent days on his
website. Egypt's Christian Cop-
tic population has long decried
what they describe as a history
of discrimination and occasional
violence from the country's Arab
majority.
Pastor Terry Jones of Gaines-
ville, Fla., who burned Qurans
on the ninth anniversary of 9/11,
said he spoke with the movie's
director on the phone Wednes-
day and prayed for him. He said
he has not met the filmmaker in

person, but the man contacted
him a few weeks ago about pro-
moting the movie.
"I have not met him. Sam Bac-
ile, that is not his real name,"
Jones said. "I just talked to him
on the phone. He is definitely in
hiding and does not reveal his
identity. He was quite honestly
fairly shook up concerning the
events and what is happening.
A lot of people are not support-
ing him. He was generally a little
shook up concerning this situa-
tion."
The film was implicated in
protests that resulted in the
burning of the U.S. consulate
Tuesday in the eastern Libyan
city of Benghazi.
Libyan officials said Wednes-
day that Ambassador Chris Ste-
vens and three other embassy
employees were killed during
the mob violence, but U.S. offi-
cials now say they are investi-
gating whether the assault was a
planned terrorist strike linked to
Tuesday's 11-year anniversary of
the 9/11 terror attacks.
Nakoula, who talked guard-
edly about his role, pleaded no
contest in 2010 to federal bank
fraud charges in California and
was ordered to pay more than
$790,000 in restitution. He was
also sentenced to 21 months in
federal prison and ordered not to
use computers or the Internet for
five years without approval from
his probation officer.

Healthy integrity
Romney's switched position calls for concern
As the 2012 presidential election nears, campaigns and candi-
dates will go to any lengths to reach victory when America
votes. This Sunday, Mitt Romney changed his position on
President Obama's Affordable Care Act. Though Romney, like most of
the GOP, wishes to repeal the act, he stated publicly that he was actu-
ally in favor of more than one aspect of the legislation. This is a drastic
change from his previous stance, and is symptomatic of a persistent
problem that should motivate voters to demand political integrity.

@America While we were gawking at
#iPhone5, U.S. sent 2

-@michdailyoped
We're all shmucked

.

Governor Romney's own remarks when
speaking to the news media were: "I'm not
getting rid of all of health care reform. Of
course, there are a number of things that I
like in health care reform that I'm going to
put in place." Mr. Romney claims that in his
own health care plan, he would include sev-
eral items from Obama's plan - including the
mandqte that insurance companies cover
those with pre-existing conditions and the
broadening of the insurance marketplace.
This is further evidence of total politici-
zation of significant issues, especially those
that affect the lives and health of millions of
Americans. At the same time, voters need to
hold candidates accountable for what they
say, so they can make a fair and educated
decision at the polls.
However, this simply doesn't follow Rom-
ney's previous stance. His campaign has
previously focused heavily on repealing
ACA to the point where the phrase "repeal
Obamacare" seemed to be a distinctive chant
associated with the GOP candidate. Unsur-
prisingly, Romney has changed his rhetoric
regarding the Affordable Care Act. Romney
has had a reputation for flip-flopping on vari-
ous issues throughout his political career.
However, this instance is particularly upset-
ting because of the magnitude of the issue in
question - with a vehicle as large as health

care, the American people could be subjected
to powerful whiplash should it go astray. It's
clear that Romney's strategy is to target vot-
ers who are still indecisive by walking the
line when it comes to the Affordable Care
Act, after "anti-Obamacare" rhetoric has
already taken hold. To win swing state sup-
port, Romney stopped short of irreversibly
offending popular sentiment.
In their relentless pursuit to win over
voters, politicians should not be caught
with unclear beliefs so close to the election.
Health care affects every American. Whatev-
er the candidate's beliefs, it's imperative that
they campaign on their real policies. A vac-
illating opinion on a crucial issue so close to
Election Day is deceptive. In order to make an
informed decision, voters must know exactly
where candidates stand. In such a sensitive
case, sincerity must prevail over populism.
Voters need to make sure to hold their can-
didates accountable, Democrats and Republi-
cans alike. The candidates should not pander
to populism, but rather should clearly articu-
late their positions. Voters need to educate
and update themselves on pertinent issues
facing America today and choose the right
candidate based on informed analysis. Candi-
dates will only provide what the constituency
demands, and therefore, the constituency
should demand a resolute candidate.

ERRYTOWN, ANN ARBOR
- Everyone has lost faith in
humanity. They are hor-
rified, they are
embarrassed
and nobody can
stop watching.
"The cinema-
tography is just
so terrible." It
"I don't
understand why
they didn't use MELANIE
more fisheye." KRUVELIS
"Is this even a
song?"
Why yes, it is a song. It's called
"Work Hard, Play Hard" by Wiz
Khalifa and maybe if we hadn't dis-
covered this "Shmacked" nonsense,
we could've listened to it ironically
while cashing bowls on our home-
work and damn, wouldn't that have
been cool. But it's too late - we've
seen it. And when did we stop using
our houseplant as the ashtray?
Alright, so here's the deal. We're
in Kerrytown - oh, a note to fresh-
men: Kerrytown is north, it's hip
and for the love of god please stop
wearing those key card lanyards.'
Anyway, we're in Kerrytown and
everyone looks absolutely miserable.
Well, more miserable than usual.
Someone found this video, "I'm
Shmacked The Movie: University of
Michigan - Welcome Week," and
the expressions in the room range
from nauseated condescension to
apathetic-American-Apparel-mod-
el-meets-kicked-puppy. The tragi-
cally hip haven't been this upset
since that anthropology professor
used Comic Sans. It's that serious.
If you haven't seen the video,

don't worry - the concept is simple.
A couple of college kids go around
campuses and capture students at
their finest hour - 9 a.m. on a Foot-
ball Saturday. They've recorded St.
Patrick's Day at West Virginia Uni-
versity, filmed 4/20 at the Universi-
ty of Vermont and now they've shot
Welcome Week here at Michigan.
Which is fantastic, really -we've
finally got a chance to stand up and
reveal what beats inside every last
Wolverine heart: "If you don't go to
Michigan, you're a peasant."
Hear hear, young white male.
But back to shotgunning Nat-
tys, smoking pot, downing shots in
South Quad, doing a weird drunken
leprechaun jig on the sidewalk, and
all the other too-drunk-to-care.
shenanigans you can cram into four
minutes of video. From here we get
the true meaning of "shmacked,"
which is not the Yiddish expres-
sion for "bagel toppings." It's actu-
ally Yiddish for getting drunk and
throwing away the futures we don't
have, and - most importantly - not
caring, because in the end we all
look really, really awesome. Hell,
we are really, really awesome.
"This school is the best school
in the entire world," says a girl in a
tube top (Side note: technically it's
the 14th best school in the entire
world, but no reason to let some-
thing as trivial as rankings get in
the way of assertions, right?).
"Fucking Go Blue, and we fuck-
ing go hard! Fuck you, 'Bama!" yells
another partygoer, referring to the
Alabama Crimson Tide, not the
President. (Okay, so they actually
killed us, but he almost got it right).
But perhaps the most touching

affirmation of our scholarly excel-
lence: "It's the perfect mix of like,
party and like, work, you know?"
Of course, moms, dads and
everyone else wh6 sucks may be
alarmed by the video, finding this
homage to Stifler's wet dream to be
a self-indulgent, stomach-churning
display of everything that's wrong
with everything. At least half of
Kerrytown threatened to drop out
after watching the video. "I wish
I'd never seen this monstrosity,"
one disenfranchised Kerrytowner
said. To which every other student
replied, "What's a Kerrytown?"
In the end, we are
all really, really
awesome.
It doesn't matter if you've seen
the video or not. Yeah, maybe it's
not the most flattering image of our
school. But while some cringe at the
sight of our fellow students beer-
bonging their livers into oblivion,
they're forgetting one crucial fact:
this isn't groundbreaking. Step out-
side on any game day and you'll see
the exact same thing. So if you're
going to take anything away from
this, let it be this - this isn't new.
This is how it's always been and
how it always will be.
God, are we shmucked.

Equal pay aligns with GOP

Look to your roots

In June, Senate Republicans blocked the
Paycheck Fairness Act from passing through
the Senate. This bill purposed to ensure
equal pay for men and women in the United
States. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that
a woman makes 77 cents to each man's dol-
lar. Despite years of effort, the bill has been
filibustered by Republicans at nearly every
attempt to pass it - they don't want the gov-
ernment dictating how much a private enter-
prise pays their employees. While I respect
that the GOP doesn't want the government
dictating the way businesses are run, I have
trouble understanding why they oppose a bill
that reflects so many of their values.
One of the most important goals of the PFA
is to preserve the sanctity of life. Accord-
ing to the Guttmacher Institute, 73 percent
of women who had abortions in 2004 did so
because they couldn't afford a child. By pass-
ing the PFA, women in single-income situa-
tions would have better financial means to
raise a child, which could lead to a decrease in
abortions. Such a decrease might also reduce
unnecessary government spending of tax dol-
lars on the time spent debating the creation
of new laws restricting access to abortion. If
protecting the sanctity of life and prevent-
ing wasteful government spending are both
essential GOP values. Why would the party
prevent this from passing?
In addition to preservingthe sanctity of life,
the PFA facilitates self-sufficiency and per-
sonal responsibility, also important GOP vir-
tues. The PFA would enable women to become
more self-sufficient and enable them to better
provide for their children. In addition, the PFA
would make women less likely to depend on
welfare as a means of familial support.
The PFA also supports traditional fam-
ily values while adjusting for a new American

Dream. The Census Bureau reports that 56 per-
cent of families are now dual-income, a result
of requiring extra money in light of the coun-
try's economic woes. If the Republican Party
wants to preserve traditional family values, it's
in their interest to ensure that both parents can
provide for their children equally.
Even in the case of a single-income family,
passingthe PFA would allow women a signifi-
cant amount of flexibility in raising a family.
For example, a woman could save money to
stay home with her children, and return to
work when she wanted.
Finally, passing the PFA reflects Christian
virtues. The Bible verse Galatians 3:28 states,
"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave
nor free, nor is there male and female, for you
are all one in Christ Jesus." If Jesus viewed
both men and women equally worthy of salva-
tion, wouldn't it make sense that the religious
voters would value gender equality as well?
Many Republicans argue that paying men
and women equally will push women out of
the workforce because they will no longer be
filling lower-paying jobs. While this concern is
valid, there are ways around it. For example,
while women may be filling higher-paying
jobs, the lower-paying jobs could be filled by
teenagers and college students, who are at his-
toric unemployment rates, givingthem invalu-
able career experience and opportunities.
I invite objectors of this bill to consider
whom their decision could be affecting. If
they could watch their loved ones suffer the
consequences of their actions with a clear
conscience, then they have that right. But
before anybody chooses to block this bill, I
hope they will keep in mind that they may be
undermining their own party's values.

Though I was thrilled to travel
to Eastern Europe with my
family this summer, I didn't
understand my
father's unmiti-
gated insistence
that we go. Of
course, I knew
why he wanted
to take my sisters
and me to Prague
and Bardejov SARAH
- the cities my ROHAN
family hails from
- but I couldn't
comprehend the
reason for his urgency.
Just two years ago in high school,
I journeyed to Eastern Europe with
my senior class. I visited the War-
saw ghetto, Majdanek, Treblinka
and Auschwitz - the concentra-
tion camp that both of my paternal
grandparents survived. While I
looked forward to visiting Europe
this summer, I wasn't sure why my
father found it imperative to bring
my family again to the "old coun-
try." My father's persistence won
out, and off we went.
From the moment we landed in
Prague, we were seeing the sights.
Our successfully-completed itiner-
ary included the Jewish quarter,
Saint Vitus' Cathedral, the Prague
castle, the Old New Synagogue, the
Charles Bridge and the old Jewish
cemetery, where my great-grand-
parents and Franz Kafka lay to rest.
Though I was deeply impressed by
Prague's beauty and history, I didn't
feel a connection to the city. Like
most other camera-hoisting English
speakers, I was simply a detached
tourist. However, that feeling quick-
ly changed once we arrived in the
remote town of Bardejov, located in
the northeastern Slovakian hillside.
Both of my father's parents were
born and raised in the shtetl of
Bardejov which, at its peak, was

home to some 3,500 Jews and the
same number of Slovaks. My grand-
parents spoke often of the small
medieval town and our visit struck a
deep chord with me. By the time we
arrived in the late afternoon, most
of Bardejov's historic sites were
closed, except for one building-the
Chevra Bikur Cholim Synagogue,
my grandfather's synagogue.
The remarkably intact build-
ing was once the epicenter of Jew-
ish life and religious discourse in
Bardejov. Its primary caretaker
was an old Slovakian man who had
gone to great lengths to preserve
the memory of the half of his town
that disappeared after 1944. The
fruits of his labor were on display
in the back of the sanctuary. In the
cheder, or study room, the caretaker
had set up a vast collection of pho-
tos of Bardejov's Jewish residents,
all of which he had collected from
remaining townspeople.
As I carefully surveyed the photos
with my dad, we discovered pictures
of my grandfather's sister, Erica, his
brother, David, and finally a pho-
tograph of his youngest brother,
Aaron, who perished in Auschwitz
at the age of six.
Holding the photographs of my
ancestors in the very place of their
origination was a moment both sur-
real and poignant.
In that moment, I had ceased tobe
a lone individual. I was a sum. I had
in my hand images of my ancestors.
I realized I have my grandparents,
my parents, and the town of Bardejov
itself to thank for my very existence.
I approached the restof my visitwith
a refined perspective of myself, the
places I encountered, the communi-
ties which once existed in those plac-
es and the different modes of living
within those communities.
One such mode is the old-fash-
ioned Jewish schooling system
which my grandfather experienced.

I couldn't help but consider that
some of its practices could enhance
our own educational system. For
example, chavruta, the method of
working with a designated study
partner. English Prof. Ralph Wil-
liams actually employs this strategy
of chavruta here at the University.
Appreciate
times radically
different than
our own.
Furthermore, I marveled at the
dynamics of community interac-
tion in Bardejov. Jew and Gentile
cooperated to maintain a prosper-
ous town and an educated youth.
Although the circumstances of Hit-
ler's war disrupted and ultimately
eradicated Bardejov's pre-WWII
culture, one can't dismiss the val-
ues it set forth. Today we might
even stand to learn a thing or two
from the bipartisanship once dis-
played in this little Slovakian town.
Simply put, there's something
extremely valuable in seeking each
of our own histories and gaining
an appreciation for a time radically 1
different than ours. My grandpar-
ents' unique past made my own
experience connecting with my
roots an especially moving one.
Those whose family history is root-
ed in very different soil than mine
can stand to benefit from acquaint-
ing themselves with their past. It's
possible for heritage to create a bet-
ter present and lend a meaningful
perspective to the future.

cutting down on tobacco use, it
has become a neglected effort in
recent years.
"So many of my patients suf-

died preventable deaths from
tobacco dependence," he said, "So
it is very troubling right now in our
country - despite the fact that we
have had great progress in tobacco
control in recent decades - that
too many have taken this progress
for granted and have ruled their
attention elsewhere."
Additionally, he said current
data shows that the number of
young people who begin smok-

600,000 annually a decade ago,
to nearly one million, noting that
approximately 25 percent of full-
time college students age 18-22
are smokers.

and World Report - it's where
we've been ... we move up and
down occasionally one or two
numbers from year to year. It real-
ly doesn't mean much," Fitzgerald
said.
Fitzgerald said he believes that
while rankings can be interest-
ing to examine, they are limited
in their ability to capture the full
profile of a uhiversity. He added
that it's often more advanta-
geous for students to focus on the
strength of a particular program
they are interested in, rather than
the overall rankings of a univer-
sity.
"It's always good to see where
you sit in comparison to other
schools, but we really don't think
that ... it's the best measure of
qualityof an institution," Fitzger-
ald said. "We think, for example,
in our position, that the quality of
the faculty (is a) better indicator
of the quality."
UNIONS

graduate students at Brown Uni-

"Without any new facts or com-
pelling reason, the board is recon-

and contemplating whether to
abandon policies that have helped
advance learning experience of
graduate students nationwide," he
said.
Roe also discussed a recent
NLRB ruling that significantly
sped up the union creation pro-
cess.
"The board's ambush election
scheme would leave graduate stu-
dents struggling to keep up with

want to join a union."

tremendously important."
Kenneth Warner, co-chair of
the Smoke-Free University Steer-
ing Committee and former dean
of the School of Public Health,
said though the new program
has been effective, problems are
bound to arise with the imple-
mentation of any new policy.
"I don't see a whole lot of
smoking on campus, (but) I do
see it occasionally," Warner said.
"There are laws against drunk
driving, but people drive drunk
... There is no policy of any con-
sequence that is not violated to

While people still smoke on
campus, Winfield said the policy
has visually lessened the num-


opportunity," he said. "Campus
policies, such as the ones that you
enjoy here at the University of
Michigan can protect health and
support tobacco-free living for
some 20 million students who are
enrolled in institutes of higher
learning."
He called the new program an
important historical collabora-
tion between public and private
officials dedicated to promoting
a smoke-free culture that will
become a new "social norm."
"The goals are very important
for public health in our country,
and the outcomes are tangible
and very relevant," Koh said.
Coleman - who helped pio-
neer the smoke-free movement on
campusbycreatingthe MHealthy
program in 2003, an organization
dedicated to improving health
and well-being at the University
- said the decision to enact the
policy was "very deliberate and
very methodical."
"It has tobe a concerted effort,
that brings together all voices and
all concerns of a campus commu-
nity," Coleman said.
Over the course of two years,
The Ross School of Business is
tied at number three for under-
graduate business school with
UC Berkeley's Haas School of
Business, and the University Law
School is ranked 10th nationally,
down from seventh last year.
According to its website, U.S.
News and World Report uses a
widely accepted ranking method
in which it considers up to 16
factors it believes to accurately
measure academic excellence,
including graduation rates, reten-
tion rates and quality of teaching
faculty. M
While schools inevitably strive
for high rankings, there is vary-
ing opinion among students as to
whether the U.S. News and World
Report rankings are helpful.
For Kinesiology junior Michael
Freedman, numbers did notcplay a
large role in his application deci-
sion. Freedman said he believes
that putting too much focus on
rankings can be misleading given
that high-ranked schools might
not offer a particular major or
social life.
during her time working in higher
education as the president of May-
land Community College in North
Carolina.
"I understand the value of the
system as it currently works," she
said. "The cost and uncertainty
associated with the proliferation
of unionization among graduate
students could force institutions
to curb, or even shut down, gradu-
ate student assistant programs."
Peter Weber, dean of Brown
University's graduate school,
spoke as a witness at the meeting
and claimed that graduate assis-
tants are primarily students.
He said that having graduate
assistants teach is a vital learning
opportunity that prepares them
for future employment.
"I am quite certain that defin-
ing Brown's graduate students
as employees would damage the
very fabric of graduate education
at Brown University and many
private institutions of learning,"
Weber said.
Christian Sweeney, deputy
director of the AFL-CIO's Orga-

nizing Department, disagreed

Coleman, along with Winfield
and Kenneth Warner, then-dean
of the School of Public Health,
worked to develop the program,
using feedback from students,
staff and faculty.
"As a community we have
worked hard to reduce cigarette
smoking and to become a smoke-
free campus," Coleman said.
"More important than working
hard though, is that we've worked
together."
Rackham student Ishwarya
Venkat said in an interview after
the event that she believes the
University's smoke-free initiative
has been critical in establishing a
healthier campus environment.
"I think it's really important
that we have a healthy environ-
ment to live and study in," she
said.
She added that she foresees
the Tobacco-Free College Cam-
pus Initiative being successful
and making a national impact if
approached effectively.
"If it's implemented in the right
way I see itcbeing very successful.
We have the ability to create an
impact," she said.
Freedman added that he is
satisfied with the University's
current ranking because he feels
the school does an effective job of
offering students a diverse expe-
rience, from quality academics to
athletics.
However, for LSA freshman
Christopher Bransburg the rank-
ings offered helpful insight to his
potential college choices.
"I think (the rankings are) a
relatively significant portion of
college admissions because it
gives you the opportunity to look
ahead and maybe see what is the
potential that the school has and
what exactly does it lack," Brans-
burg said.
Despite the drop, Bransburg
said he feels this year's rankings
portray the high caliber of educa-
tion the University offers.
"Would I like it to be better?
Yes," Bransburg said. "Would
I like to say that I came from a
school that was ranked number
three or number one? Yes. But
29th out of the nation, I think
that's really good."
with Weber's assessment.
Sweeney said graduate assis-
tants have many issues, from
workplace safety to health insur-
ance, that only unionization is
essential in helping to fix.
"The notion that the NLRB or
Big Labor is somehow pushing its
way into academia is misguided,"
Sweeney said. "In fact, the oppo-
site is true. Workers in academia
are reaching out to unions in large
numbers."
At the University, the Gradu-
ate Employees Organization
attempted to unionize graduate
student research assistants, but its
attempts were unsuccessful after
the state Legislature passed a law,
signed by Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder, earlier this year that pro-
hibited GSRAs from organizing.
The unionization struggle
divided University leaders as
the Democratically controlled
Board of Regents supported the
unionization efforts despite the
objections of University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman, Provost
Philip Hanlon and nearly all of

the University's deans.

Clinton appears subdued
after convention speech

Former president
avoids harsh
criticism of GOP
after Florida
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - The
free-wheeling and fiery Bill
Clinton who stole the show at
the Democratic Party's conven-
tion showed up in Florida this
week far more subdued.
The former president's tem-
perament appeared designed
to match the moment. Clinton's
campaign swing on behalf of
President Barack Obama coin-
cided with two somber occa-
sions: the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks and the tumul-
tuous events in Libya that left
four American diplomats dead.
In a nod to the tragedies,
Clinton muted much of his
direct criticism of Republi-
can presidential nominee Mitt
Romney during campaign ral-
lies in Miami and Orlando. But
he did draw sharp and detailed
contrasts between Obama and
Republicans on a myriad of
policies, including health care,
education and the debt.
Clinton never mentioned
the deaths of the Americans in
Libya, perhaps trying to avoid
interfering with the delicate
diplomacy his wife, Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton, was dealing with back in
Washington.
Chris Stevens, U.S. ambas-
sador to Libya, and three dip-
lomats were killed Tuesday as
protesters overran and burned
the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.
Clinton drew about 4,300
people to the two events in
Florida, building on his well-
received address at last week's
Democratic convention.
"What works is cooperation.
What fails is constant conflict,"
he said Wednesday in Orlando.
Clinton was talking about
Obama's economic vision, but
he might as well have been
talking about the complex rela-
tionship between the two men.
They may not be close friends,
but Obama and Clinton have
bonded over the shared expe-
rience of the presidency. And
they've largely healed their
divisions from the 2008 Demo-
cratic primary when Obama
defeated the former president's
wife.
But their freshly minted

political alliance comes with
risks for both men.
Clinton risks denting his
sky-high favorability ratings
by jumping back into the politi-
cal fray. He learned that lesson
when he campaigned for his
wife in 2008 and came across at
times as angry and out of touch
with the current political land-
scape.
Some Democrats fear that
the popular Clinton could over-
shadow Obama. A new Pew
Research Center poll found
that 29 percent of those sur-
veyed said Clinton's convention
speech was the highlight of the
party gathering, while just 16
percent called Obama's speech
the highlight.
Clinton won praise for deliv-
ering a forceful defense of the
president's economic policies
and pressing the need for him
to serve a second term. But the
convention address revived
a nagging frustration among
Democrats who can't under-
stand why Obama hasn't been
able to make that case more
clearly himself.
"Sometimes Obama speaks
at a level that is only for the col-
lege-educated," said Ray Vera,
a Florida Democrat. Vera said
Clinton's convention speech
compelled him to come see the
former president speak Tues-
day at an Obama campaign rally
in Miami.
Unlike Obama, Vera said,
Clinton speaks "with such calm
and confidence" and in ways the
average person can understand.
Obama himself joked this
week that someone recom-
mended he name Clinton "sec-
retary of explaining stuff."
The president's aides either
dismiss the risks that come with
joining forces with Clinton or
say they're worth taking
With Clinton, first lady
Michelle Obama and Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden at its disposal,
the president's campaign now
has three popular and persua-
sive surrogates who can fan
out across battleground states.
And Clinton shines with groups
Obama sometimes struggles
to connect with, particularly
working-class whites and older
voters.
In a true sign of Clinton's
popularity, Romney has decid-
ed not to try to fight against the
former president. Instead, he's
trying to use him to highlight
for voters what he says Obama

is lacking.
"I think he really did elevate
the Democrat convention in a
lot of ways," Romney said Sun-
day on NBC's "Meet the Press."
"And, frankly, the contrast may
not have been as attractive
as Barack Obama might have
preferred if he were choosing
who'd go before him and who'd
go after."
Unlike Obama, Romney can't
call on his party's last occupant
of the White House in this elec-
tion. Former President George
W. Bush remains a polarizing
figure and Romney is seeking
to distance himself from many
of Bush's policies, both for-
eign and domestic. Bush didn't
attend the Republican conven-
tion and isn't expected to have
any role in the fall campaign.
Clinton, on the other hand,
is expected to campaign for
Obama frequently between
now and November. He's likely
to return to Florida again and
is also expected to campaign in
Ohio, Virginia and Iowa.
Obama's team has also put
Clinton, a prolific fundraiser,
to work helping them close
their money gap with Rom-
ney. Obama and Clinton have
teamed up for two campaign
fundraisers, and the former
president is also helping Priori-
ties USA Action, the struggling
Obama "super" political action
committee, raise funds.
It's also something of a turn-
around for Clinton, who left
office with positive approval
ratings for his handling of the
presidency but negative ones
for his personal character.
In a January 2001 Gallup/
CNN/USA Today poll, 65 per-
cent of Americans said they
approved of the way Clinton
was handling "his job as presi-
dent," while just 41 percent said
that they approved "of Clinton
as a person."
Fast-forward to the pres-
ent: A Gallup poll released
last week showed Clinton was
viewed favorably by 69 percent
of Americans, including 43 per-
cent of Republicans and 68 per-
cent of independents. That's his
highest favorability rating in
polls back to 1993.
Clinton, of course, has his
own motivations for his full-
throated support of Obama's
campaign. Those close to him
say it's no secret he'd like to
help pave the way for another
presidential run for his wife.


ber of smokers, especially near
the Michigan Union, the Michi-
gan League and other prominent
buildings.
"Not only has the visual count
of people who are smoking
dropped, but the amount of ciga-
rette butts in many of these (pop-
ular) locations has dropped,"
Winfield said.
Marsha Benz, a health edu-
cator at the University Health
Service, said there are programs
available at UHS through the
Tobacco Consultation Service for
smokers at trying to nix the habit.
Along with behavioral coun-
seling services, Benz said TCS
and UHS offer free nicotine
replacement products, such as
patches and gum, to help smok-
ers hoping to quit.
Though LSA junior Miranda
Kahn acknowledged the envi-
ronmental benefits associated

with the smoking ban, she said
the choice to smoke should ulti-
mately be made by each person.
"It promotes healthy environ-
ment and promotes clearing the
air, but in the sense of the issue of
free will, that can also be some-
thing that is in conflict," Kahn
said. "I believe that if someone
chooses to smoke that is their
own personal choice."
Kahn said her friend was once
reprimanded for smoking outside
a library, and Kahn thought the
breach of protocol was handled
effectively.
"He came back saying that a
couple of people had come up to
him, advising him of the rules,"
she said. "I thought that was
great that there were people
who were being verbal about
(the smoke-free policy) and they
were expressing to him their con-
cern."

Ruling Dutch party claims
victory in national elections

A supporter of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles hurls stones at supporters of Venezuela's President
Hugo Chavez, who were hurling stones backafter an opposition campaign event ended in Venezuela on Wednesday.

PUERTO CABELLO, Ven-
ezuela (AP) - Violence erupted
at an opposition campaign event
in Venezuela on Wednesday as
supporters of President Hugo
Chavez blocked a road and a
campaign truck was torched.
Both sides hurled rocks, and
police said at least 14 people
were hurt.
A large crowd of Chavez sup-
porters in red shirts blocked a
main road near the airport in the
coastal town of Puerto Cabel-
lo before a visit by opposition
candidate Henrique Capriles.
A truck used'by Capriles cam-
paign was set ablaze, and a
motorcycle was also torched.
Capriles had been scheduled
to visit an area that has tradi-
tionally leaned pro-Chavez,
and opposition supporters were
seen running to take cover dur-
ing the violence.
At least 14 people suffered
cuts and other minor injuries,
police in Carabobo state said.
After the violence, Capriles
spoke at an outdoor rally in
the town, blaming Chavez and
small "radical groups."
"Those actions aren't sponta-
neous. There's someone respon-
sible for those actions," Capriles

told the crowd. Addressing
Chavez without mentioning the
president's name, Capriles said:
"It's you who wants that sce-
nario. It's you who wants to sow
fear.'
"We know that he who turns
to violence, it's that he's afraid
of the other's ideas," Capriles
added. "We're tired of violence."
His supporters chanted, "We
aren't afraid!" Capriles had
been on his way to the event
when the clashes erupted, and
to bypass the blocked road he
traveled by helicopter to a spot
where fishermen took him by a
motorboat to the area.
Chavez has recently said his
rival has a hidden agenda to
impose right-wing measures
"that would lead Venezuela to
a civil war." But Chavez has
denied intending that as a threat
or trying to promote violence in
any way.
Duringthe melee, some ofthe
red-shirted government sup-
porters went into the airport
compound and carried away
speakers and a generator.
A station wagon filled with
Capriles' campaign fliers also
was trashed as people broke
the windows, ripped out the
headlights and began to pull out
parts from under the hood. The
campaign fliers were left scat-
tered on the ground.
Carabobo state Gov. Hen-
rique Salas Feo, a Chavez oppo-

*nent, condemned the violence
on television saying, "The coun-
try needs peace."
National Guard troops
arrived at the airport after-
ward.
Tensions have sporadically
unleashed violent clashes and
scuffles between supporters
of the two candidates ahead of
the Oct. 7 presidential vote, in
which Chavez is seeking anoth-
er six-year term.
National Electoral Council
president Tibisay Lucena con-
demned the violence, saying it
appeared to have been provoked
by a group of people. She didn't
lay blame on either political
camp.
Jorge Rodriguez,Chavez's
campaign manager, blamed
government opponents and said
the Carabobo police, which are
under Salas' command,attacked
Chavez's partisans.
Rodriguez said government
supporters "have a right to pro-
test and demonstrate freely"
against Capriles< visit.
"The police arrived and sav-
agely attacked the people,"
Rodriguez said on television,
adding that Chavez<s campaign
has photos of Carabobo police
officers in civilian clothing par-
ticipating in the violence.
Kelvis Olleda, a 15-year-old
Chavez supporter, blamed the
opposition for provoking the
incident.

"It's an honest platform," he
said. "On the one hand we're for

ment finances, but also for a real
social policy and welfare net."
The result was a victory for
pro-European forces in the
Netherlands, a founding member
of the EU whose export-driven
economy has benefited from the
bloc's open market.
Whatever form the new gov-
ernment takes, it is not likely to
derail the current Franco-Ger-
man compromise approach to
solving Europe's sovereign debt
crisis.
Both the VVD and Labor
endorse cost-cutting for most
governments to keep them
within European budget defi-
cit rules. But they also support
exceptions or even bailouts for
fiscally stressed countries such
as Greece, Spain and Italy - as
long as they adhere to externally
mandated cost-cutting targets
and labor market reforms.
While critical of a strict aus-
terity-only solution to the debt
crisis, the parties can work
together. Labor backed Rutte at
crucial moments in the past year
to approve bailout funds and
endorse European-level solu-
tions to prevent the debt crisis
from spinning out of control.
Rutte is closer to German
Chancellor Angela Merkel in his
outlook, and Samsom closer to
French President Francois Hol-
lande, but in a coalition those
differences would likely balance
out.
By not flocking to Wilders
or the euro-skeptical Socialist
Party, Dutch voters signaled, at
least an acceptance of the impor-
tance of a healthy Europe: in
national polls, voters said that
no election issue was nearly as
important as the state of the
Dutch economy and the effect
Europe's sovereign debt crisis is
having on it.

rights.
U.S. District Judge Kather-
ine Forrest in Manhattan said
the government has softened its
position toward those who filed
suit challenging the law, but she
said the "shifting view" could
not erase the threat of indefinite
military detention. She urged
Congress to make the law more
specific or consider whether it is
needed at all.
"First Amendment rights are
guaranteed by the Constitution
and cannot be legislated away,"
Forrest wrote. "This Court
rejects the Government's sugges-
tion that American citizens can
be placed in military detention
indefinitely, for acts they could
not predict might subject them to
detention."
In May, the judge temporarily
struck down the law subjecting
to indefinite detegtion anyone
who "substantially" or "directly"
provides "support" to forces such
as al-Qaida or the Taliban. She
heard additional arguments last
month before issuing the final
ruling, likely tobe appealed to the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
While calling the law "uncon-
stitutionally overbroad," For-
rest said the government can use
another law to indefinitely detain
people connected to the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks or others
picked up on the field of battle.
She said the government at some
point without additional congres-
sional authorization began inter-
preting its detention authority
more broadly.

"In short, the Court can find
no authority in domestic law or
the law of war, nor can the gov-
ernment point to any, to justify
the concept of 'support' as a valid
ground for detention," Forrest
wrote.
The judge said the govern-
ment struggled to explain what
the statute means and what and
whose activities it was written to
cover.
"That is no small question ban-
died about amongst lawyers and a
judge steeped in arcane questions
of constitutional law; it is a ques-
tion of defining an individual's
core liberties," she said.
She questioned in her 112-page
opinion whether a news article
perceived as favorable to the Tal-
iban and garnering support for
the Taliban could be considered
to have "substantially supported"
the Taliban?
"How about a YouTube video?
Where is the line between what
the government would consider
"journalistic reporting" and
"propaganda?" she asked. "Who
will make such determinations?
Will there be an office estab-
lished to read articles, watch
videos, and evaluate speeches in
order to make judgments along a
spectrum of where the support is
'modest' or 'substantial?"'
Ellen Davis, a U.S. Attorney's
office spokeswoman, said the
government had no comment.
Plaintiffs' lawyer Bruce Afran
called the ruling "very historic"
and said it was rare in the last
half century that a judge would
declare a federal statute uncon-
stitutional for directly intruding
on speech.
"But it was a very extraor-
dinary attempt by the govern-
ment to provide punishment for
speech," he said.
Among plaintiffs who testi-
fied at a March hearing was
Pulitzer Prize-winning journal-
ist Christopher Hedges, who has
interviewed al-Qaida members,
conversed with members of the
Taliban during speaking engage-
ments overseas and reported on
17 groups named on a list pre-
A

pared by the State Department
of known terrorist organizations.
He testified the lawhas led himto
consider altering speeches where
members of al-Qaida or the Tali-
ban might be present.
The judge said that she was
"mindful of the extraordinary
importance of the government's
efforts to safeguard the coun-
try from terrorism" and that the
high stakes of those efforts and
the executive branch's expertise
mean the courts owe the political
branches "a great deal of defer-
ence in the area of national secu-
rity."
But she said the Constitution
places limits on the president's
power to act and requires courts
to safeguard core Constitutional
rights. She noted that scattered
cases during World War II when
the Supreme Court sanctioned
undue deference to the executive
and legislative branches resulted
in actions that "are generally now
considered an embarrassment,"
such as the internment of Japa-
nese Americans based on war-
time security concerns.
Forrest called the govern-
ment's suggestion that the court's
role be limited to a post-detention
habeas review "without merit
and, indeed, dangerous" because
cases would take years to be
resolved and are reviewed under
a lesser legal standard.
She said if habeas petitions
that allow prisoners to challenge
their detention are the only way
for those detained under the
law to gain freedom - even U.S.
citizens on U.S. soil - then "core
Constitutional rights available in
criminal matters would simply be
eliminated."
She added: "No court can
accept this proposition and
adhere truthfully to its oath."
Kuntz said he told his mother
that he was gay at the same time
he told her he was kicked off the
team.
"I'm struggling with it," said
Rita Kuntz, choking back tears. "I
love Jamie and I'm proud of him,
but I know what the school did
was wrong."

Mohamud, which was hit by two explosions in Mogadishu, Somalia, Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2012.
New Somali president survives
attack on second day in office

Two suicide
bombers attempt
assassaination
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
- Somalia's new president sur-
vived an assassination attempt
on his second day in office when
two suicide bombers blew them-
selves up Wednesday while try-
ing to gain access into a heavily
guarded hotel that is his tempo-
rary residence, officials and wit-
nesses said.
The attack highlights the chal-
lenge that insecurity caused by
an Islamist insurgency poses to
Somalia's fledgling government,
which is expected to help trans-
form the east African country
from being a failed state to one
with functioning government.
The African Union Mission for
Somalia said one of its soldiers
was killed when the two suicide
attackers attempted to penetrate
the Jazeera Hotel where the Pres-
ident Hassan Sheikh Mohamud
and Kenya s foreign minister
were giving a news conference.
Three soldiers were wounded in
the blast.
The two suicide bombers set
off explosions after they were

shot by soldiers guarding the
Jazeera Hotel, while another was
intercepted and shot dead as he
attempted to scale the walls of
the hotel's compound, the Afri-
can Union Mission for Somalia,
known as Amisom, said in a state-
ment.
Witnesses say at least one more
person was killed, bringing the
total death toll to a minimum of
five, including the three attack-
ers.
The president who was elected
by Parliament on Monday, was
undeterred by the explosions and
continued to speak to the media,
AMISOM said.
Al-Shabab, a radical Islamist
militia that is affiliated with al-
Qaida and waging an insurgency
against the Somali government,
quickly claimed responsibil-
ity for the attack. Al-Shabab had
opposed Mohamud s election,
saying it had been manipulated
by Western powers.
Somali parliamentarians were
tasked with electing a president
since no election could be held,
given the state of security around
the country.
African Union forces are help-
ing the Somali government fight
al-Shabab, which the U.S. has
designated as terrorist group and

which neighboringAfrican coun-
tries consider a threat.
Police Corp. Yusuf Ali said
he was guarding the Somalia
immigration department near
the Jazeera Hotel when the two
blasts occurred.
An Associated Press photog-
rapher inside the hotel for the
president's news conference with
Kenyan Foreign Minister Sam
Ongeri confirmed the two offi-
cials were safe. The photographer
said he saw at least five bodies
near the gate of the hotel. Witness
Mohammed Nuradin confirmed
that death toll.
President Mohamud has
taken up temporary residence
at Jazeera Hotel in a highly pro-
tected zone near the airport
before moving to the presidential
palace. During Monday's elec-
tion, he defeated Sheik Shariff
Sheikh Ahmed who was seeking
re-election as president after hav-
ing led a transitional government
for three years. Somalia has had
transitional administrations
since 2004.
Mohamud, 56, an academic
and activist, is expected to form
the county's first functioning cen-
tral government since 1991, when
warlords, overthrew a longtime
dictator.

JEFF CHIU/AP
Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks in front of an image of the iPhone 5 during an Apple event in San Francisco, Wednesday, Sept.
12, 2012.
Apple unveils thinner iPhone

Missouri lawmakers rebut federal
contraception mandate in override

New phone, iPods to
come to U.S. stores
next Friday
SAN FRANCISCO - For the
first time, the iPhone is grow-
ing even as it slims down. After
sticking for five years to the same
screen size, Apple on Wednesday
revealed a new phone that's taller,
and has a bigger display.
The iPhone 5 will go on sale in
the U.S. and eight other countries
next Friday, Sept.21.
Even though it's taller than the
iPhone 4S, it's lighter, thanks to a
new screen technology that makes
the whole phone thinner.
The bigger screen - 4 inches
measured diagonally - creates
room for another row of icons on
the screen and lets widescreen
movies fit better. The calendar will
now show five days at a time instead
ofjustthree. Previous iPhone mod-
els carried 3.5-inch screens.
In another big change, the
iPhone 5 will come with the capa-
bility to connect to the fastest new
wireless data networks in the U.S.
and overseas.
The improvements mean the
iPhone 5 is taking a bigger leap
up the evolutionary chain than
its predecessor, which wasn't that
much different than the iPhone 4.
The new device also carries
another distinction: It's the first
iPhone developed and unveiled
since the death of Apple founder
Steve Jobs.
The iPhone that Jobs had con-
ceived ushered in what he billed
as "the post-PC era" - a shift that
is causing people to rely less on
personal computers and more on
mobile gadgets they can hold in

their hand. Jobs died last October
the day after Apple introduced the
iPhone 4S, which was the fifth
version of Apple's phone.
There was little surprise in
Wednesday's announcement.
Despite the pains the company
takes to hide its plans, the rough
launch date, the new screen and the
capability to connect to so-called
LTE networks had been reported
for months by blogs and analysts.
"There was nothing unexpect-
ed in terms of the new features of
the iPhone," said Tavis McCourt,
an analyst with Raymond James.
That's a contrast to last year,
when Apple watchers were first
surprised by a delay in the launch,
and then by the fact that the
iPhone 4S didn't offer much new
except Siri, a voice-activated assis-
tant. The 4S, nevertheless, has
been a smash success. During the
first nine months that the iPhone
4S was on the market, Apple's rev-
enue from iPhones has exceeded
$63 billion, helping to establish
Apple as the world's most valuable
company ever, as measured by its
stock price.
One thing that did surprise
McCourt this year: Apple is
launching the phone in so many
countries so quickly. On Day One,
the phone willbe available in Aus-
tralia, Canada, France, Germany,
Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and
the U.K., besides the U.S.
A week later, it will go on sale in
22 more countries, including Italy,
Poland and Spain.
Another surprise about the
iPhone 5 is that it's 18 percent
thinner than its predecessor. The
company was expected to take
advantage of any additional space
to expand the phone's battery, not
make the phone thinner.


Apple followed its usual script
for the new iPhone's coming-out
party. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Jobs'
hand-picked successor, kicked off
the festivities before an audience
of reporters, bloggers, applications
developers and specialguestswith
a summary of the company's mile-
stones. He then handed things
over to his top lieutenants, agroup
led by marketing chief Philip
Schiller and mobile software
executive Scott Forstall.
It has become such a familiar rit-
ual that Cook, Schiller and Forstall
all appeared to be wearing the
same attire as they did at Apple's
last product event in June. Adopt-
ing a personal work uniform was
something that Jobs embraced.
After learning that designer Issey
Miyake had made work uniforms
for Sony Corp. employees in Japan,
Jobs eventually paid Miyake to
make him the black mock turtle-
necks that became the signature
piece of clothing in an ensemble
that included jeans and New Bal-
ance sneakers.
With Jobs gone, the Apple exec-
utives left the showmanship to the
rock band Foo Fighters, who closed
outthetwo-hour presentationwith
three songs, including one called
"My Hero" dedicated to the com-
pany's employees for developing
products like thie iPhone 5.
It's the year's most antici-
pated phone. The number Apple
can sell, analysts believe, is lim-
ited mostly by the production
capacity of its suppliers. There
had been concerns that supplies
could be tight. Even so, analysts
are expecting Apple to sell tens
of millions of phones before the
year is out, including perhaps as
many as 10 million during the
last 10 days of this month.


Gubenatorial veto
overriden in rebuke
of Obama policy
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)
- Missouri lawmakers enacted
new religious exemptions from
insurance coverage of birth con-
trol Wednesday, overriding a
gubernatorial veto and delivering
a political rebuke to an Obama
administration policy requiring
insurers to cover contraception.
Although Missouri and 20
other states already had some
sort of exemption from contra-
ceptive coverage, Missouri's
newly expanded law appears to
be the first in the nation directly
rebutting the federal contracep-
tion mandate, according to the
National Conference of State
Legislatures and supporters of
the law.
Republican legislative lead-
ers barely met the two-thirds
majority needed to override the
veto by Gov. Jay Nixon. They
got help from a few of Nixon's
fellow Democrats and ultimate-
ly persuaded one particular
Republican lawmaker who had
opposed the measure to support
the override.
The Senate vote was 26-6.
The House vote was 109-45, the
minimum needed for an over-
ride. Most provisions of the new
law took effect immediately,
though some parts won't kick in
for another 30 days.
Shortly after the vote, an
attorney for the Greater Kansas
City Coalition of Labor Union

Women said it was seeking an.
injunction against the measure.
Among other things, the suit
being filed in Cole County Cir-
cuit Court claims the new Mis-
souri law conflicts with President
Barack Obama's health care law
and thus should be struck down.
The Missouri measure was
championed by the Missouri
Catholic Conference, Missouri
Right to Life and other religious
and anti-abortion groups. Sup-
porters said it is meant to register
their disapproval of a policy by
President Barack Obama's admin-
istration that requires insurers to

cover birth control at no addition-
al cost to women, including those
employed by religiously affiliated
nonprofits such as hospitals, col-
leges or charities.
Numerous pending lawsuits
claim the federal policy infringes
on religious rights, including one
filed Wednesday by Christian-
oriented Hobby Lobby Stores Inc.
"This bill is about protecting
our religious liberties. This bill
is about protecting businesses
from the overreach of govern-
ment," said Rep. Sandy Craw-
ford, R-Buffalo, who handled
the legislation in the House.

Steady decrease in production
not a concern for Roundtree

Roundtree patient
even as receiving
numbers continue
to plummet
By BEN ESTES
Daily SportsaEditor
The Michigan football team's
passing game has been seized by
Devinmania, with the develop-
ment of junior receiver Devin
Gardner and the emergence of
freshman tight end Devin Funch-
ess dominating the conversation
surrounding the team this week.
Lost in the attention paid to
those two tall targets is fifth-year
senior receiver Roy Roundtree,
the mostbattle-tested of all of the
Wolverines' pass-catchers. But if
Roundtree has been somewhat
of the forgotten man, it's for good
reason - he's yet to make a true
impact in the passing game so far
this season.
In the season opener against
Alabama, Roundtree managed
just two catches for 12 yards, and
while the Devins were busy light-
ing up the Air Force secondary
last week, Roundtree tallied just
one reception for five yards.
Add it up, and you have the
recipe for one frustrated wide
receiver. But Roundtree says he
isn't getting bogged down by his
lack of production.
"Just helping the team,"
Roundtree said. "I know the stats
don't really mean anything to
me. As long as I go out there and
block and help the team out, I
don't really even look into all that
because I'm a team player. My
time will come."
It's that attitude that helped
Roundtree get through what was
likely a tough individual season
for him a year ago.
In 2010, the Dayton, Ohio
native emerged as quarterback
Denard Robinson's favorite tar-
get in Rich Rodriguez's spread
offense. The Robinson run fake-
to-Roundtree seam route was one
of the team's staples that year, and
Roundtree totaled 72 receptions
and 935 yards for the season en
route to earning All-Big Ten Sec-
ond Team honors.
But the arrival of Al Borg-
es' hybrid West Coast system
last year seemed to stymie
Roundtree's game. He had the
catch of the year with his last-sec-
ond, game-winning touchdown
reception against Notre Dame,
but his overall numbers slipped
drastically - he hauled in just 19
catches and tallied 355 receiving
yards.
Roundtree has filled up the stat
sheet even less through the first
two games this season, even as
Robinson has flashed an improved

In summer months, countless people cradle
comically large watermelons without ever
considering the fruit's formative days.
When Natural Resourses & Environment
masters student Allyson Green described the
process of watching a watermelon develop, she
unconsciously spread her arms out like the ten-
drils of a watermelon's vines.
"I had no idea what a watermelon looked like
growing," Green said. "To watch this little, tiny
plant go from looking like it was about to die, and
all of a sudden you had these beautiful flowers and
this tiny little watermelon growing on it.
"A little bit of hard work and some great things
that have nothing to do with us are happening to
make that little watermelon grow."
Many students may think
of gardening as an
activity reserved
for the elderly,
whittling away
their twilight

Syed takes
classes rightMa e
across from
the University's
Cultivating Com-
munity garden, but
says he's never heard
of it before.i
"I wouldn't say I notice any-
thing at school," Syed said. "If there are flowers, it
makes the place look nice but that's about it."
Syed described the Nichols Arboretum as
"amazing" and said he's always enjoyed his
mother's garden. Yet he added that federal money
shouldn't be used to fund gardening unless it's
research related, referring to federal funds that
went toward sustaining heirloom peonies at the
Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in the summer
of 2011. He added that the University shouldn't be
investing a significant amount of money on gar-
dening for "aesthetics" alone.
But according to some, gardening can have
artistic and practical merits that might justify why
the 'U' allots resources to gardening and research-
ing horticulture.

LSA junior Ali Imam says he believes urban
farming is an important initiative that the Univer-
sity should continue to focus on in order to create
a more sustainable food system.
"Green is good," he said.
No matter what perceivable benefits might
come from gardening, several students agreed
that there is natural artistry inherent to garden-
ing. With some nurturing, a garden can become a
tangible work of public art.
Cultivating Community
Locatedbetween the apocalyptic sounds of East
Quad's renovation and frat houses littered with
post-game Solo cups is the Cultivating Com-
munity garden, a patch of land
outside of the Ginsberg
Center. It overflows
with sunflowers and
greenery as tall as
the students who
likely walk past
every day with-
out giving it a

Yet stu-
dents dedi-
cated to

nization on

willing to get
their hands
a little dirty.
Std n They main-
tain a seemingly
constant burst of
color and natural
artistry.
The group fosters a
public space that beautifies
a little corner of Ann Arbor while
also demonstrating and supporting local garden-
ing efforts that have tangible benefits for individu-
als and the collective public space.
A recent addition to the Cultivating Commu-
nity family, Green spent the summer as an intern
at the Arb, where as a program coordinator, she
helped oversee all activities around the gardens.
She organized workshops and field trips for those
who were curious about gardening and growing
their own food.
As the name suggests, Cultivating Community
doesn't just produce vegetables and flowers. Stu-
dents from across the University come together
to create their garden, a process that begets the
group's other main goal: outreach inAnn Arbor.

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"A N"Gone Girl"
Joining the ranks of Carmen Sandiego, Waldo
and the Declaration of Independence (Damnit,
Cage!) is Amy Elliot Dunne, missing wife of Gillian
Flynn's recent release. She was - is, the Dunnes'
lawyer will say - a snappy, stunning New York
native. So why is her husband caught grinning by
cameras? It's sharp, its plot diabolic and its cast of
characters delightfully wicked.
CROWN
Night Visions
- Imagine Dragons
You've probably heard Imagine Dragons whis-
pered at Espresso Royale. Maybe you've heard the
single "It's Time." But for a band whose first album
Night Visionsquietly reached number one on iTunes
best-selling albums, there's more than meets the
eye. Rock anthems, jams, inspiring hymns - and all
NE P with a singer with palpable excitement.
"Mamma Mia!"
We all know the real cinematic masterpiece
of 2008 was the musical extravaganza "Mamma
Mia!" Pierce Brosnan may have once played the
most iconic secret agent in pop culture, but remem-
ber that time he also tried (he really, really did try
so hard) to sing? Heaven is almost certainly a place
where Meryl Streep sings ABBA songs on an end-
less loop, making "Mamma Mia!" the closest thing
UNIVERSAL we have to paradise.
"Cougar Town"
Get a bottle of red and those wine straws ready,
becausethe cul-de-sac crewisback. TBS announced
that "Cougar Town" will kick off its new season on
Jan. 8. For now, play a round of Penny Can, turn
any game into a drinking game, and stay confident
in your sexuality (just like Mariska Hargitay). If
h you're unfamiliar with Jules and her neighborly
winos, don't let the title discourage you: "Cougar

David Bowie knew where he
was going... maybe.
The day began simply enough.
David had to be on the other
side of the city by noon, so he
awoke at the crack of dawn to go
through his usual cosmetics and
hair routine. But he only had the
tips of his fingers dipped into
his favorite hair gel when some-
thing strange started to happen.
David was tumbling through
the very folds of space and
time. Everything he ever knew
flashed around him as his body
transported to another galaxy
- a galaxy occupied by strange
wildlife and blue people.
After initially wondering if he
was experiencing an "Avatar"-

themed acid dream (it wouldn't
be the first time), David quickly
realized exactly where he was.
This world, with its blue people
and nonsensically large trees,
was his inner consciousness:
Bowieland.
Knowing he brought himself
to Bowieland for a reason, David
embarks on a thrilling race
against the clock to figure out
just exactly what it is he wants
from ... himself. But the two evil
overlords of Bowieland, who
go by the monikers Childhood
Fears and Lifelong Regret, will
stop at nothing to keep David a
prisoner in his own head.
Childhood Fear continually
shows David the moment in

his past when his older brother
hung David by his underwear on
the door handle; Lifelong Regret
flashes images of David's lum-
berjack-style beard he sported
all throughout college. Will
David be able to escape in time,
or will he be forced to hum "I'm
blue da ba dee da ba die" forever?
From Donald H. Carpenter
comes "He Knew Where He
Was Going (?)," the true-ish tale
of the epic adventure of Ziggy
Stardust and the space oddity
that changed everything.

TRAILER REVIEW

Bad-ass of the year? "The
World's Most Interesting Man"
probably wins
that distine-
tion. Bad-ass
of all time? SkyflI
James Bond
would cer-
tainly be a
leading contender. And the
recent explosive trailer for the
latest installment of the legend-
ary 007 thrill ride, "Skyfall,"
reminds us why.
Bond parries bullets and
explosions; he fixes his cuffs
promptly after each confronta-
tion; Javier Bardem, sporting
Aryan-like hair and a creepy
smile, is sinister; the Bond girls
are as seductive as they are dan-
gerous - none of the franchise's
fundamentals are lost.
Never before has Bond been
more complex as he is now in

performance. Couple that with

pic theme Waner Bros
song?
That is, if you've actually
heard it. The mish-mash of ran-
dom sounds wasn't even close to
the anthemthatLondonneeded,
quietly pushing the track into
relative obscurity.
Muse's new single "Madness"
is a step further in the wrong
direction. An album's first legit-
imate single should be catchy,
concise and enticing, baitingyou
to bite on the record as a whole.
"Madness" is none of that.
Instead, the track is a five-
minute build-up of vibrating

Sam Mendes' direction, and
Bond, a character never recog-
nized as beingtragic until "Casi-
no Royale," has more potential
than ever to show his capac-
ity for redemption and wisdom.
Picking Mendes, an artsy film-
maker, as director was a gamble.

From what the trailer shows,
Mendes, while understand-
ing the heart of the franchise,
has expanded upon the artistic
boundaries set by his predeces-
sors. An old sheriff with new
tricks is back in town.

effort to pro-
vide healthy,

CSG, in collaboration with
University Unions, University
Health Systems, U Catering, U
 Housing and Residential Ser-
vices and a host of other campus
departments, will set up shop
today in the Union courtyard -
located next to Amer's - from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. to sell a variety of
fresh and locally grown flowers,
plants, produce and other delec-
table fare.
"Our focus is on healthy and
sustainable living," said LSA
sophomore Parisa Soraya, a mem-
ber of the CSG Health Issues
Commission and the organizer of
the market. "We're doing that by
having demonstrations from Uni-
versity chefs."
CSG and its collaborators will
utilize the market not only as a
produce sale, but as a way to edu-
cate students about the impor-
tance of going green.
"They'll have free samples for
students and also provide them
with recipes," said Soraya.
The recipes the chefs prepare
will include produce from the
market to encourage students to
try new foods.
Soraya said due to the over-
whelmingly positive response
after 2011's market, farmers this
year will offer a greater quantity
and variety of produce. Another
notable difference from 2011; stu-
dents can now purchase produce
using cash, credit cards or Blue

"We organized workshops
and fieldtrips for people who
just wanted to learn more about
how to garden, how to eat local-
ly, what to do with food from the
garden," Green said.
Cultivating Community hosts
open workdays where Ann Arbor
residents can cultivate garden-
ing skills, such as composting,
on a micro level. And, if tradi-
tional gardening doesn't suit
your fancy, Green said everyone
is encouraged to try some fresh
raspberries straight from the
vine.
In addition to their work in
Ann Arbor, Cultivating Commu-
nity has partnerships with the
Detroit non-profit Focus Hope
and the Summer in the City's
community service program,
which brings children from the
metro Detroit suburbs to volun-

teer in the city.
Last summer, Cultivat-
ing Community helped run a
community garden in Detroit
that allowed local kids to tend
their own garden plots. Green
explained that for many of these
kids, fresh produce isn't read-
ily affordable. Cultivating their
own gardens and growing pro-
duce helped teach participants
the benefits of fresh food.
"By having this garden ... the
kids can learn where this food
comes from and why (they)

Bucks.
Soraya stressed the impor-
tance of the entire campus com-
munity making strides toward
sustainable eating.
"We're a really big University,"
she said. "It makes more of a dif-
ference when the whole Univer-
sity participates in these things
because there's a lot of people
going towards the same goal."
Keith Soster, food service
director for University Unions,
noted the importance of buying
locally grown produce and said
all produce at the sale will have
been grown within a 250-mile
radius of Ann Arbor.
"When you can get it locally
and support the local vendors I
think that means a whole lot to
the community," Soster said.
In addition to today's market,
CSG will host a second sale on
Sept. 27 in the gallery of the Dud-
erstadt Center on North Cam-
pus and a third on Oct. 11, in the
courtyard of the Union.
Soster said more markets will
provide an opportunity to sell
different produce as growingsea-
sons change. He said the October
sale will feature pumpkin and
squash, whereas "(in) the first
one you'll see more things like
should eat it, why (they) should
want to grow it," Green said.
Though Green said she wasn't
sure if the plants are still being
cared for since the summer
ended, she recalled one boy who
carefully monitored his creation.
"There are a few who were
keen on having their own plant,"
Green said. "One kid had some,
I think it was okra, that he was
watching grow, and maybe some
pumpkins. So every week he'd
come back and just look at his
plants and take care of them."
Growing Hope in Ypsilanti
LSA sophomore Shaina Shetty
says gardening can change lives.
As a researcher at Growing Hope
in Ypsilanti last summer - a
non-profit devoted to spreading
awareness about gardening and
healthy food - she documented
how gardens can elevate a neigh-
borhood's aesthetic and help
generate an interest in nutrition.
"It starts spreading through
observation, when you see
someone in your neighborhood
gardening," Shetty said. "We'd
plant a garden in one house and
the house next door would see it
and say, 'Hey, this is interesting,
let's do this.'"
If families qualify for the pro-
gram, Growing Hope volunteers
help them set up a personal gar-
den. For the first year families
are required to produce certain
food, but after a year, what they
grow is up to them. Gardens that
began as one raised-produce bed

flowers."
Not only will University chefs
educate students on sustainable
eating and provide recipes, but
farmers will attend to discuss
their crops and the challenges
involved in the growing process.
One of the farmers will instead
bring honey to the market, since
his usual apples were decimated
this year by inclement weather.
"That'll be an important edu-
cational piece for our commu-
nity," Soster said. "It's important
for everybody to understand how
availability affects price, and sea-
sonality affects price, and how
devastations can affect every-
thing."
Soster mentioned that in addi-
tion to the market, the U-Go's in
the Union, will continue to fea-
ture Farm Fresh Wednesdays,
during which students can buy
fresh produce every week until
the end of the growing season.
Soster said Farm Fresh Wednes-
days, which began in the first
part of July, are "a beautiful
thing."
"I think it was really great for
our community to see that num-
ber one, we partner with local
vendors, that we have produce
available for them to pick up, and
would soon turn into full-blown
gardens that families could tend
to until their entire lawn was
covered in food and flowers.
"Some of these gardens are
gorgeous ... they are definitely
pieces of art in some cases,"
Shetty said.
Not only could families that
wouldn't ordinarily have access
to fresh food now grow their
own, but according to Shetty, the
artistic beauty of the gardens
makes neighbors more likely to
invest in their neighborhoods.
"Community gardening
works as a whole, everyone in
the neighborhood is working
on it. If you're not working on
it your mom is working on it, or
your friend and so there's a lot of
potential," Shetty said. "It's been
a community building effort ...
people are less likely to destroy
something that's already so
beautiful."
Growing Hope pulls many
volunteers and interns from the
community in which they work.
Shetty saw how children who
began by helping out in their
family gardens would soon com-
mit to helping their neighbors
start their own sustainable gar-
dens with the aid of Growing
Hope.
She discussed one woman she
knew who, before starting her
garden, said she had a low iron
count. By the end of the summer
she attributed her normal iron
count to the food she'd been eat-
ing from her garden.
"I've always just seen eating

then thirdly, that they can take
those items and taste it," he said.
Erica Wald, manager of
MHealthy Nutrition and Weight
Management, which promotes a
culture of health at the Univer-
sity, said the program acts as a
"support arm" for the markets
and reaches out to the Univer-
sity's faculty and staff to attend
the sale.
In addition to chefs from the
University Unions, Wald said
MHealthy chefs will create vari-
ous "MHealthy approved" reci-
pes that will be featured at the
sale. MHealthy recipes promote
the use of whole grains, fruits,
vegetables and healthy fats, and
all meet the MHealthy Nutrition
Guidelines.
Wald said she was encour-
aged to continue to support the
sale after experiencing the great
enthusiasm pervading last year's
sale.
"People are there and they
are thankful that you're there,
they're excited to see food dem-
onstrations and taste the food
and talk to the farmers, there was
a great energy," she said.
Students are encouraged to
bring reusable bags to carry their
purchases.
food as a thing you do, I've never
really given thought to it," she
said. "Like eating fruits and veg-
etables, I took it for granted in my
household, and for some people
that's not normal," Shetty said.
An ever-changing landscape
Though students like Syed
may denounce the craft of gar-
dening, those who are in groups
such as Growing Hope and
Cultivating Community work
throughout the year to educate
people on how practical and
fruitful the practice can be.
"Yes, we have a lot of peo-
nies because they look cool, but
there's also just a lot of research
that goes into that and there's a
heritage behind it too," Green
said of the peonies that annually
blanket the Arb in a sea of purple
and pink. "It's more than just
looking at flowers. It's educa-
tion, and community outreach,
and just giving people a place to
rest and re-collect themselves
and find peace."
From using deconstructed
milk cartons to grow plants in
Ann Arbor, to watching children
become invested in their health
in Detroit, to creating beautiful
landscapes and neighborhoods
in Ypsilanti through gardening,
it appears that gardening has
multiple functions.
"Landscapes change over-
time," Green said. "Humans
change them, they change on
their own. Here's a chance to see
it happening."

that only yesterday, my ten-year-
old self donned her favorite hot
pink Harry Potter hoodie from
the now-extinct Warner Bros.
store at Somerset Mall and
skipped off to the theater to see
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone." Nothing will ever com-
pare to experiencing "Harry Pot-
ter" for the first time, but every
time I watch the film, I am trans-
ported back to that very first
viewing and the palpable excite-
ment in the air.
It's that immersive nostalgia
that makes "Sorcerer's Stone"
such a joy to watch years later.
Seeing Daniel Radcliffe, Emma
Watson and Rupert Grint as ador-
able children will never fail to
tug at my heartstrings, since I've
grown up with them as the films
released and their careers evolved.
I almost never fail to comment on
how young they are, only to stop
short when I realize that I was

The performances aren't

but this cast shines as a group
from the very beginning. For me,
they clicked the moment I saw
Neville (Matthew Lewis). Lewis,
with a pudgy face that would grow
into something of a work of art,
is so pitch-perfect a visual of the
"round-faced and forgetful" Nev-
ille that viewers instantly plunge
headfirst into the story.
From the moment he knocks

Albus Dumbledore with quiet

of wizardry and fame. And I'd be
remiss not to applaud Alan Rick-
man' Snape, who truly makes an
entrance that to this day makes me
fear landing in detention.

There's also the fact that
"Sorcerer's Stone" itself is a film
intended to introduce the entire
world of "Harry Potter." Director
Chris Columbus directed every
moment with full awareness of
the importance of that task. The
eclectic shops of Diagon Alley to
the floating candles in the Hog-
warts Great Hall to the vibrant
colors and sound of Quidditch.
These moments are crafted to
take the viewer's breath away
with the magic of filmmaking
and of J.K. Rowling's elaborate
universe.
As for the role "Sorcerer's
Stone" plays in setting up the
narrative of "Harry Potter,"
Columbus once again succeeded
in conveying the importance of
these characters and what hap-
pens to them. After years of grip-
ing as a fan over which scenes
were altered or characters omit-

ted (you were there in my heart,
Peeves), I finally look back on
"Sorcerer's Stone" with the per-
spective of knowing the full Pot-
ter story. There, Columbus hits
all the right notes.
I will always smile at the first
shot of Harry in his cupboard;
always giggle at Ron and Herm-
ione's first awkward encounter
on the train. Visual effects may
have come a long way in 11 years,
but I'm still mesmerized by
Quidditch, terrified of Fluffy the
three-headed dog and unable to
look away when Voldemort sur-
rounds Harry with flames down
in the depths of the school. And I
will always, always feel my heart
