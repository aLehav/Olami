Alum reflects on
2003 affirmative
action case
By CAROLYN GEARIG
Daily StaffReporter
Jennifer Gratz, plaintiff in
Gratz v. Bollinger, a 2003 U.S.
Supreme Court case challeng-
ing the University's race-based
admissions policies that were

in place, spoke to more than
150 people at North Quad Resi-
dence Hall Tuesday night.
Student organization Young
Americans for Liberty hosted
the event, which was held in a
large classroom that was stand-
ing room only. Outside, a crowd
holding signs and chanting
through megaphones protested
Gratz's views on affirmative'
action.
During the talk Gratz
discussed the history of her

case as well as current events
surrounding affirmative action.
Students and visitors' from
surrounding areas - including
severalhigh-schoolandmiddle-
school students from Detroit -
asked her questions and gave
their opinions on the issue, at
times raising their voices and
engaging in arguments with
Gratz.
Gratz's talk came after the
Supreme Court heard oral
arguments Oct. 15 for Schuette

v. Coalition, which seeks to
reverse the 2006 ballot initia-
tive that amended the Michigan
Constitution to ban race and
gender consciousness in college*
admissions, commonly called
Proposal 2.
Gratz sued the University in
1997 after she applied and was
denied admission to the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and
the Arts in 1995. At the time,
the University used a 150-point

Psych. professor
will attend
conference with
Daili Lama
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Kent Berridge, the James Olds
Collegiate Professor of Psychol-
ogy and Neuroscience, hesitated a
year ago before takingthe offer to
discuss his research on addiction
with the Dalai Lama.
"It seemed so overwhelming;
it was certainly nothing I would
put myself forward for," Berridge
said. "I didn't feel quite up to
what the Dalai Lama group might
want."
But now Berridge is in
Dharamsala, India, the site of the
exiled Tibetan government, pre-
paring to participate in Mind &
Life XXVII: Craving, Desire and

Addiction. It's the 27th lecture
sponsored by the Mind and Life
Institute, a nonprofit organiza-
tion that investigates the inter-
section between Buddhism and
science founded in part by the
head monk of Tibetan Buddhism.
All experts in their respective
fields, the dozen event speakers
typically include philosophers,
scientists, psychologists and Bud-
dhist monks. Berridge said he
looks forward to the interdisci-
plinary perspectives the dialogue
will offer.
Psychology Prof. David Meyer
attended and organized a research
dialogue with Daili Lama in 2009.
He - said the interdisciplinary
nature of the dialogues led to "pro-
found new insights."
"Buddhism has alot of neat ideas
that you can bring into a scientific
framework to pursue further and
that will advance both the science
and, like the Dalai Lama would
want, the Buddhism," Meyer said.

By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Certain members of the Ann
Arbor City Council hope to see
the new marquee digital bill-

board at Michigan Stadium shut
off - at least partially.
Monday night, Councilmem-
ber Christopher Taylor (D-Ward
3) announced he, Margie Teall
(D-Ward 4) and Marcia Higgins
(D-Ward 4) will bring forward a
request to discontinue the digi-
tal billboard at the next council
meeting on Nov. 7.
In June, City Council passed
an amendment to the existing
outdoor advertising ordinance
that prohibits the introduction

of digital billboards into the city
or the transformation of old bill-
boards into digital ones.
Taylor said he and the other
supporters are going to suggest
that the University discontinue
use of the billboard off East Sta-
dium Boulevard because it can be
distracting to drivers.
"We are going to request they
... either decommission the bill-
board, or, if they decline to do
that, to limit its usage to events

Candidate says .
council should focus
on long-term issues
By FARONE E. RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
With the general election
approaching on Nov. 5, Ann
Arbor resident Kirk Westphal is
gearing up to run for city council
in the Second Ward.

Westphal grew up on Long
Island before subsequently
moving to New York City. He
describes the decision to move
to Ann Arbor nine years ago as a
mutual one with his wife.
"After we got married, we
thought, 'What's the next phase
of our lives?' " Westphal said.
"We both were still fans of New
York, but we felt like it was time
to see something else for a while.
We were thinking of starting a
family, so we decided we need-

ed to pick a place we'd be happy
regardless."
Westphal got his undergradu-
ate degree at the University of
Pennsylvania, earning an eco-
nomics degree from the Whar-
ton School. Upon moving to Ann
Arbor, he acquired a Master's
degree in urban planning from
the University.
While Westphal worked
in marketing and advertising
in New York, he now devotes

Man indicted in 'Baby

Sierra Club endorses

Hope' New York cold case Lumm for second ward

I

52-year-old cousin
of victim charged
by state's grand
jury on Tuesday
NEW YORK (AP) - A man
accused of killing his 4-year-old
cousin, known for two decades
only as "Baby Hope," was indict-
ed Tuesday in one of the city's
most haunting cold cases, as his
lawyer continued to question a
police confession that sealed the
man's arrest.
Conrado Juarez, a 52-year-old
kitchen worker, remained held
without bail and wasn't in court
as prosecutors said a grand jury
decided there was enough evi-
dence to continue charging him
in the girl's death. His lawyer
had decided Juarez didn't need
to be at the brief proceeding.
Manhattan Assistant District

Attorney Melissa Mourges didn't
disclose the specific charge
or charges, which is typical in
Manhattan at this stage of the
prosecution.
Juarez was arraigned earlier
this month on a charge of mur-
der, one of the few offenses with
no statute of limitations in New
York state.
The child's body was found
in 1991 in a cooler alongside a
Manhattan highway. Juarez
would have been about 30 at
the time. Afterward, detectives
nicknamed the then-unidenti-
fied child "Baby Hope," helped
arrange her burial and paid for
her headstone.
Police marked the 22nd
anniversary of the discovery
of her body by putting up fli-
ers and announcing a $12,000
reward for information. A tip
then finally led investigators
to her name - Anjelica Castillo
- and to Juarez's arrest this

month.
Police and prosecutors say
Juarez confessed to sexually
abusing and suffocating Anjeli-
ca. At the time, the girl was liv-
ing with his sister. The sister has
since died.
Juarez later told newspapers
that the girl died accidentally
and that he only helped his sis-
ter dispose of her body. He said
detectives pressured him into
saying he killed her.
His lawyer, Michael Croce,
has underscored that Juarez's
statements to authorities came
after about 12 hours of interro-
gation and that prosecutors have
yet to disclose whether any DNA
or other physical evidence ties
him to the girl's death.
"I don't trust any statements
that were made, by any individu-
al, after being in custody for such
an extended period of time,"
Croce said after court Tuesday.
Juarez is due back in court

Environmental
group supports
candidate's parks
preservation work
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily News Reporter
After interviewing the three
candidates for the seat on City
Council, the Sierra Club, a well-
known national environmental
conservation group, announced
their support for independent
candidate and current Council-
member Jane Lumm (I-Ward 2).
James 'D'Amour, political
chair of the Sierra Club Huron
Valley Group, said in a statement
that Lumm's beliefs have clashed
with the club's in the past, but
her current work and record
make her a good choice for the
organization.
"TTrtrle rvrtoti

community has earned her our
continued endorsement, on the
issue of parklands protection in
particular," D'Amour said. "She
has been earnestly cooperative
and wanting to work with us
on all of our issues, from parks
protection, to the Pall-Gelman
plume, to alternative energy,
and shares our concerns on new
challenges such as the threat of
hydrofracking in the Ann Arbor
area."
The Sierra Club backed Lumm
in her 2011 campaign to rejoin
city council after giving up her
seat in 1998. The club chose not
to endorse her then because of
her opposition to some aspects of
their greenbelt work.
Lumm said she supported parts
of efforts to improve the green-
belt, but did notwholly agree with
their use of funds in the purchas-
es. Specifically, she did not want
Ann Arbor to have to fund pur-
chases made outside the city.
dT h b mh nP oa A-7A.xP

one of the reasons she garnered
the group's support this time
around was because of her sup-
port of conserving parks.
"Over the course of this recent
tenure, I sponsored a resolution
to place on the ballot a charter
amendment requiring voting
approval before parkland could
be permanently repurposed,"
Lumm said. "It didn't pass, but
I indicated that I intend to bring
thatback again. If I'm re-elected,
I think there will be sufficient
support on council."
Apart from park conservation,
Lumm said upkeep of the Huron
River and managing creek sheds
are other important environ-
mental issues facingthe city.
Lumm joins the ranks of other
councilmembers backed by the
Sierra Club, including Mike
Anglin (D-Ward 5), Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) and
newly elected Jack Eaton (D-
Ward 4), who will take his seat

arrested for lying
about past conviction
CHICAGO (AP) - An Arab-
Americancommunity activist from
the Chicago suburbs was arrested
Tuesday on immigration charges
for allegedly lying about her con-
viction for a deadly bombing more
than 40 years ago in Israel.
RasmiehYousef Odeh, 66,spent
a decade in an Israeli prison for
her involvement in a 1969 attack
that involved bombs planted at a
crowded Jerusalem supermarket
and a British consulate, accord-
ing to a federal indictment. Only
one bomb - one of two placed at
the supermarket - exploded, kill-
ing the two people and wounding
several others. Israeli authorities
have saidthe attacks were planned
by the Popular Front for the Lib-

An Israeli military court sen-
tenced Odeh to life in prison in1970,
but she was released10 years later in
a prisoner exchange with the Popu-
lar Front. Israel released 76 prison-
ers in exchange for antIsraeli soldier
captured in Lebanon, according to
Odeh'sindictment.
But U.S. authorities accuse
Odeh of failing to mention her
conviction and time in prison on
immigration papers when she
came to the U.S. from Jordan
in 1995 and before she became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004,
the indictment says.
Odeh was arrested Tuesday
morning at her home in Ever-
green Park, just southwest of
Chicago, according to prosecu-
tors. She moved to the Chicago
area shortly after gaining citi-
zenship in Detroit in 2004, said
Khaalid Walls, a spokesman for
U.S. Immigration and Customs

Her defense attorney James
Fennerty said Odeh has been a
close friend of his for years and he
never discussed her conviction in
Israel or the 10 years she spent in
prison.
"I never really asked her," he
said. "She's one of the nicest peo-
ple. ... She's always caring. She's
not a threat to anyone."
Odeh works as an associate
director at the Arab American
Action Network, a Chicago-area
nonprofit group that advocates
for new immigrants and tries to
combat anti-Muslim and anti-
Arab prejudice, according to its
director, Hatem Abudayyeh.
According to the network's
website, Odeh has a law degree
and has worked as a lawyer. It
says one of her focuses has been
working with domestic-violence
groups and addressing various
women's issues.

Bomb damages
Sleeping Bear
Dunes outhouse
A bomb explosion severely
damaged an outdoor toilet at
Sleeping, Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore in northwestern Mich-
igan but caused no injuries, offi-
cials said Tuesday.
The device apparently deto-
nated around 4:30 a.m. Sunday,
Leelanau County Sheriff Mike
Borkovich said. His office received
a call from a man who heard the
boom and said it shook his house.
Deputies searched the area but
found nothing suspicious.
Later that day, someone report-
ed damage to the outhouse, locat-
ed at the School Lake boat launch
in Cleveland Townshipabout 2
miles from where the initial caller
lives.
Technicians with the FBI
and the Michigan State Police
determined that a bomb had
been placed in or next to the out-
house, Borkovich said. He said he
couldn't provide any details about
the device.
DETROIT
Review shines
light on Detroit
streetlamp troubles
A review of two Detroit neigh-
borhoods reveals that nearly half
of the streetlights don't work.
The Public Lighting Author-
ity of Detroit said Tuesday that
about 2,200 of more than 4,900
streetlights in the block-by-block
review are out.
The review is the first phase
of two pilot projects and will be
used to design new street light-
ing for both areas. Installation
of new lights is expected to start
next month.
Fewer than half of Detroit's
88,000 streetlights are believed
to work, resulting in complaints
from residents and business
owners. Entire blocks are left in
the dark at night because over-
head lights are blown or busted,
or because the wiring has been
ripped out of ground-level trans-
former boxes by thieves.

He added that Buddhism
as a spiritual practice leaned
towards a scientific approach.
"The Dalai Lama has said
if there are any beliefs in
Buddhism which turn out to be
contradicted by what scientists
are finding, then Buddhism
is going to have to change its
beliefs so it's consistent with
science," Meyer said
The Mind and Life Institute
chooses a topic each year
for its week-long dialogues.
Addiction, the topic this year,
is a key question in Buddhism
and science alike. Buddhism
posits craving as the root of all
suffering. An overabundance
of craving can develop into
addiction, which concerns
psychologists like Berridge.
"Addiction is basically just
a kind of chronic craving

scale to evaluate applicants,
and 100 points were needed to
guarantee admission. While a
perfect ACT or SAT score was
12 points, a 20-point bonus was
given to applicants who identi-
fied as African-American, His-
panic or Native American.
In her remarks, Gratz sug-
gested that University's defini-
tion of diversity is too limited to
race.
"If the director of diversity was
here right now, he or she couldn't
tell you how many cello play-
ers there were," Gratz said. "She
couldn't tell you how many red-
heads there were. But she damn.
well could tell you how many
Blacks,how many Hispanics, how
many Native Americans there are.
Thatrightthereiswhattheymean
whenthey say diversity."
Though it's often alleged and
the Court has opined that the
policies benefit the entire cam-
pus by increasing the perspec-
tives available, Gratz finds them

over which somebody who is
addicted doesn't have control,"
Meyer said. "Regardless of
whatever you're addicted to,
you're goingto have veryintense
cravings and it's impossible to
completely satisfy that craving.
As a result of being unsatisfied,
you suffer."
Berridge's role at the
dialogue is to explain the
scientific background of
addiction. It is impossible to
discuss solutions to addiction
without understanding how an
addict's brain functions.
"I think that my perspective
might help them to understand
the essence of craving and
the essence of good and bad
cravings," Berridge said. "I'm
there to describe the problem
better and help them come up
with a better solution."
Berridge's research shows
that there are two sections
of the brain behind cravings:
wanting and liking. A person,

that he hopes it will have "a ton

Amnesty criticizes U.S.
drone program in Pakistan

Laborers, elderly
woman indicated
as victims of U.S.
missile fire
ISLAMABAD (AP) -
Amnesty International called
on the U.S. to investigate
reports of civilians killed and
wounded by CIA drone strikes
in Pakistan in a report released
Tuesday that provided new
details about the alleged vic-
tims of the attacks, including
a 68-year-old grandmother hit
while farming with her grand-
children.
Mamana Bibi's grandchil-
dren told the London-based
rights group that she was
killed by missile fire on Oct.
24, 2012, as she was collect-
ing vegetables in a family field
in the North Waziristan tribal
area, a major militant sanctu-
ary near the Afghan border.
Three of Bibi's grandchildren
were wounded in the strike, as
were several others who were
nearby, the victims said.
The U.S. considers its drone
program to be a key weapon
against insurgentgroups that it
says stages cross-border forays
into neighboring Afghanistan.
But the belief, widespread in
Pakistan, that the strikes kill
large numbers of civilians
sparks resentment and compli-
cates the two countries' ability
to coordinate efforts against
militants based in the country,
including al-Qaida.
An even deadlier incident
noted by the report - titled
"'Will I be next?' U.S. drone
strikes in Pakistan"- occurred
in North Waziristan on July 6,
2012. Witnesses said a volley
of missiles hit a tent where a
group of men had gathered for
an evening meal after work,
and then a second struck those
who cameto help the wounded,
one of a number of attacks that
have hit rescuers, the rights
group said.
Witnesses and relatives said
that total of 18 male laborers

with no linksto militant groups
died, according to Amnesty.
Pakistani intelligence officials
at the time identified the dead
as suspected militants.
The U.S. did not respond
to request for comment on
the strike. President Barack
Obama said during a speech
in May that the U.S. does not
conduct a drone strike unless
there is "near-certainty that
no civilians will be killed or
injured." But Amnesty said
the U.S. is so secretive about
the program that there is no
way to tell what steps it takes
to prevent civilian casualties.
They say it has "failed to com-
mit to conduct investigations"
into alleged deaths that have
already occurred.
Several different organiza-
tions have tried to track the
number of civilian casualties
from nearly ten years of drone
strikes in Pakistan, including
the Long War Journal web-
site, the New America Foun-
dation think tank and the
Bureau of Investigative jour-
nalism. These groups indicated
that the attacks have killed
between 2,065 and 3,613 peo-
ple, the report said. Between
153 and 926 were thought to be
civilians.
Amnesty said it is concerned
that the attacks outlined in the
report and others may have
resulted in unlawful killings
that constitute extrajudicial
executions or war crimes, even
though the U.S. insists the
strikes are legal.
"We cannot find any justifi-
cation for these killings. There
are genuine threats to the USA
and its allies in the region, and
drone strikes may be lawful
in some circumstances," said
Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty Inter-
national's Pakistan researcher.
"But it is hard to believe that a
group of laborers, or an elder-
ly woman surrounded by her
grandchildren, were endanger-
ing anyone at all, let alone pos-
ing an imminent threat to the
United States."
Amnesty called on the U.S.
to comply. with its obliga-

tions under international law
by investigating the killings
documented in the report and
providing victims with "full
reparation."
The U.S. carried out its
first drone strike in Pakistan
in 2004 and has carried out
nearly 350 more since then, the
majority of which have been in
North Waziristan. President
Barack Obama significantly
ramped up attacks when he
took office in 2009, and the
number peaked the following
year with over 100 strikes. The
frequency has steadily dropped
since then, partly because of
growingtension between Paki-
stan and the U.S. There have
only been around two dozen
strikes so far this year.
Pakistani officials regularly
denounce the attacks in public
as a violation of the country's
sovereignty, but senior mem-
bers of the government and
the military are known to have
supported the strikes in the
past.
"Amnesty International
is also extremely concerned
about the failure of the Paki-
stani authorities to protect
and enforce the rights of vic-
tims of drone strikes," said the
report. "Pakistan has a duty to
independently and impartially
investigate all drone strikes in
the country and ensure access
to justice and reparation for
victims of violations."
Amnesty said victims they
interviewed with no appar-
ent connection to militant
groups have either received no
compensation or inadequate
assistance from the Pakistani
government.
The top political official in
North Waziristan gave Bibi's
family around $100 to cover
medical expenses for the chil-
dren injured in the strike,
even though the total cost to
the family, including loss of
livestock and repairs to their
home, was around $9,500, the
rights group said. None of the
victims in the attack on the
laborers received compensa-
tion, Amnesty said.

The battle for donor equality
A federal ban on gay men donating blood is scientifically flawed
As Michigan's annual Blood Battle blood drive against the Ohio State
University approaches, Blood Drives United, a student-run organi-
zation, is starting a petition to overturn the ban on gay men donating
blood. Currently, any male who says they've had sexual contact with another
male is permanently banned from donating blood. This question harms both
agencies trying to maximize blood donations and villainizes gay men. As a
prejudicial ban long overdue for an appeal, the suggested alteration of gays
donating blood should be implemented and the movement supported.

The petition, organized through We The,
People,.the White House's petitioning platform,
supports replacing the current survey ques-
tion with one that will continue to prevent the
spread of HIV, the justification used for barring
gay men from donating. The Food and Drug
Administration currently prohibits gays from
contributing because they are "at increased risk
for HIV, hepatitis B and certain other infec-
tions that can be transmitted by transfusion."
The proposed new question, which asks if any-
one has had unprotected sexual contact with
a new partner in the past 12 weeks, would still
allow an accurate screening process for these
types of diseases. However, instead of targeting
gay men and their sexual histories since 1977
- as the policy reads now - this new question
significantly reduces tile risk of anyone of any
sexual orientation from donating potentially
contaminated blood.
From a scientific standpoint, the risk of gay
men donating HIV-infected blood is an outdat-
ed stigma. Even with the gay population having
a higher HIV percentage rate than other sexual
orientations, new technology has minimized
the risk of transmitting the disease. Every

donated sample gets screened for HIV, and the
odds of a false negative are one in two million.
Therefore, there's no scientific purpose for gay
men not to donate, which is agreed upon by
numerous medical establishments, including
the American Medical Association. "The life-
time ban on blood donation for men who have
sex with men is discriminatory and not based
on sound science," William Kobler, an AMA
board member, said in a statement in July.
The ban on gays donating blood has been
prejudicial and technologically illogical for
longer than necessary, and it's time for a
change. Numerous pieces of legislation have
tried to overturn the ban since 1997, and con-
sidering hospitals continuously have a low
blood supply, the time has come to allow gay
men to donate.
The' proposed question addresses the
FDA's concerns while also including a group
of donors that should have been eligible long
ago. With the petition only needing 100,000
signatures for the Executive Branch to view
the proposal, hopefully this could be an
important step in the battle to end the stigma
and be a step toward social justice.

one ever present in academia: emo-
tional versus logical.
Binaries are problematic for a lot
of reasons. Not only do they leave no
room for the grey in-betweenness
that most things actually fall into,
but they also hierarchize categories.
In the case of emotion versus logic,
the latter always trumps the former,
especially when it comes to knowl-
edge and scholarship. The problem
with ranking binaries is that we're
not only ranking concepts, but iden-
tities and experiences informed
by these concepts. In this case, the
logic-emotion binary elevates Euro-
centric Cultures that emphasize less
expressive ideals, while debasing
non-western/non-white cultures
that may be differently or more emo-
tionally expressive.
The logic versus emotion question
plays out in many scenarios between
both people of oppressed and privi-
leged identities. In dialogues, for
example, although all participants
may be processing their emotions
in their own ways, privileged folks
often set the guidelines for how to do
so. By universalizing arbitrary rules
on what kind of emotional expres-
sions are and aren't permissible, they
police the emotions of everyone else
in the room.
Recently, I was in a conflict reso-
lution meeting that involved two
white men on one side and a diverse
collective of people of color on the
other. My friend, who was clearly
upset and hurt by the incident we
were addressing, steered away from
speaking in abstracts like some in the
room, and instead took a courageous
risk by telling how the incident per-
sonally impacted her and explaining
what was going on inside.
Her transparency and exposed
vulnerability was met with fierce

tone policing, shrouded through
whitewashed phrases such as,
"Can't we have a civilized discus-
sion?" and "I can't speak with
someone angry who isn't even look-
ing at me," and "I advise we speak
with more tact and decorum."
This sort of emotional policing,
especially when it occurs during con-
versations related to race, only per-
petuates racism by settinga dynamic
where white people are instructing
people of color on how to express
their emotions and how to speak -
about race or otherwise.
Beside being very racialized, the
logic-versus-emotion notion is also
verygendered.Rootedinpatriarchal
norms, this binary renders profound
intuitions and emotional energy as
things specific to women. And even
if women consider these powerful
sources of knowledge, these ele-
ments are regarded as inherently
weak and dubious because of their
perceived femininity.
Ironically enough, the "emotion-
al" label is applied-
irrationally and j
inconsistently. Regulati
For example,
when men exhibit and iSn t
anger, they're not "
seen as "being so is groun
emotional" but as
"just being men." Opp1
Because aggres-
sion is deemed
an integral part of hypermasculin-
ity and therefore looked at favorably,
anger by men often isn't even viewed
as being emotional. And even if it is,
it's viewed as a justifiable, good type
of emotional.
On the other hand, if a woman
is even slightly passionate while
speaking and resists being silenced
in the process, she's not only labeled
emotional, but as the bad kind of
emotional - a derogatory word,
loaded with all sorts of inferiority
undertones.
Regulating what is and isn't
deemed emotional and what types
of emotions are deemed good or
strong, bad or weak depending on
who practices them is groundless
and oppressive.
Erasing emotions because we
think doing so somehow leads us to
better and higher forms of knowl-
edge is a hegemonic norm that ought
to be questioned. Why should an

abstract theory or scholarly "factual"
pieces be looked at as the only way
of knowing, or as more informative
than our lived experiences? Who
does abstract theorizing benefit and
whose perspective does it 'center?
Whose perspective does it leave out?
It's a strange feeling to be stud-
ied and spoken about by others in
the same room. In class recently, we
looked at Muslim women in the Mid-
dle East. Obviously, everyone had
something to say. The class sat there
for an hour and half intellectualizing
the shit out of everything.
Somehow this conversation was
supposed to relate or speak to my
people, our history and, to some
extent, me. But none of it did. When
I finally mustered up the energy to
bring in my personal experience,
what I said stood contrary to what
the reading said, which made things
complicated for the instructor who
centered the discussion around a
particular academic perspective and
for the students who wanted so badly
to consume it
as Truth.
ng what is There are
no number of
emotional books, essays or
equations that
can teach what
"s e I know through
essl~e- my experience
as an Arab-
American
woman. By foregrounding my own
experiences and the diverse experi-
ences of other Arab-Americans and
women of color, I am able to decen-
ter and destabilize the whiteness and
maleness that we've been taught to
place at the center of all that we learn.
This shift in perspective affects how
I think about readings for class, how
I take in what my professors say and
how I choose to write about and
produce knowledge.
There is no need to pretend that
we live in a postemotional society.
Nothing appeals to me about a soci-
ety that fears feelings and won't
admit that emotions are very much
tied into learning. Our lived experi-
ences and intuitions shape how we
receive knowledge because what we
feel cannot be divorced from what
we know - for all of us.

Laughing at Laffer -

During a White House meeting with Dick
Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in 1974, Arthur
Laffer, .a newly minted economics Ph.D. from
Stanford University, sketched on a paper napkin
a simple parabola which he believed perfectly
captured the relationship between marginal tax
rates and government tax receipts. Supply-side
economics and the modern Republican Party
were born.
Supply-side economics, the belief that the
key to maximizing economic growth lies in cut-
ting marginal tax rates, was always too simple
and rustic for academic macroeconomists. Laf-
fer and other supply-siders built their careers
in insulated right-wing think tanks and peri-
odicals - far removed from the peer-reviewed
world of academia. Faith inthe power of tax cuts
to deliver America from the evils of unemploy-
ment and sluggish growth never had a home in
the ivy tower. And to this day, there are literally
no supply-side economists in tenure at any major
American university.
So if supply-side economics lacks the rigorous,
well documented and well researched theoreti-
cal backbonethatonly thorough academic debate
can provide, what about Laffer's scrawled graph
is so intellectually persuasive for the right? This
exploration of the underpinnings of the Laffer
curve is bestundergone by entertaining two sim-
ple questions on public policy.
First, if the government was to set marginal
tax rates at zero percent, how much revenue
would the government take in? A softball ques-
tion: If there's no tax, then the government col-
lects no taxes, so there's zero tax revenue.
Second, how much revenue would be collect-
ed if marginal tax rates were set at 100 percent?
Intuitively, most would saythatall income would
go to the feds in tax revenue, but why get out of
bed and head to work in the morning if all your
wages are gobbled up by faceless bureaucrats?
Clearly, there is no incentive to punch the clock
if your income is eaten whole by the gluttonous
maw of the IRS. Thus, a marginal tax rate of 100
percent will leave federal coffers untouched and
empty as the populace leave their workplaces
unattended. That means the revenue-maximiz-
ing tax rate must be between these two extremes.
In terms of public policy, the implications of
the Laffer curve are also straightforward. If tax
rates are to the left of the maximum tax revenue
point we can hike them to increase tax revenue,
and if tax rates are to the right of this point we
can cut them to accomplish the same. A correct
theory, albeit an uninteresting one, is that real
controversy is notwith the Laffer curve itself, but
rather with the "Laffer hypothesis."
Laffer used his parabola to make two supposi-
tions about the economy. First, the United States
was far to the rightcof the tax rate that maximizes
revenue, and second, the optimal tax rate is close
to zero percent. The policy implication was, and

still is, immensely appealing to conservatives.
If Laffer is correct, the federal government can
drastically cutincome tax rates while simultane-
ously producing a deluge of federal tax receipts.
Laffer also claimed that these cuts would produce
sweeping economic growth as workers increase
their productivity in response to higher effective
incomes. Math may not be sexy to Republicans,
but a proposal which succinctly vilifies Big Gov-
ernment certainly is.
Taking Laffer at his word, former President
Ronald Reagan cut the top marginaltaxrate from
70 percent to 28 percent. But rather than creat-
ing a revenue bonanza, the federal debt reached
a historical high of $2.85 trillion - a threefold
increase in the tab left by the Carter administra-
tion. While there was a tepid increase intaxreve-
nue, when extraneous factors that automatically
raise tax receipts are factored out, the tax rate
change had a neutral or negative impact on rev-
enue growth, as detailed bythe Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities.
But what of Reagan's impressive growth
record? Per capita GDP increased at an average
annual rate of 3.4 percent during Reagan's years,
but two confoundingvariables make itextremely
difficult fortax cutsto be credited as the proprie-
tary source ofthe1980s boom. First,much ofthat
growth is attributable to the economy makingup
for losttime after bottoming out during the 1981-
1982 recession atcan unemployment rate of10 per-
cent. In the business cycle, deeper slumps make
for headier booms, so Reagan benefitted from a
rising tide of economic activity entirely outside
of his control. Second, throughout this period,
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, after
raising the federal funds rate to a sickening high
of 20 percent to squash stagflation, progressively
cut interest rates throughout the 1980s, increas-
ing investment spending and buoying economic
growth.Moreover,supply-sideeconomics' ingre-
dients for growth,higher labor productivity and a
greater national savings rate never materialized.
Labor productivity grew slower under Reagan
than it did under Carter, and the national savings
rate fell from 7.8 percentof GDP to 4.8 percentby
the close of Reagan's term.
So the question becomes if tax cuts weren't
a magic bullet in the 1980s, then what are the
odds that they'll be beneficial in 2013 under atax
regime which is much more lenient than the one
which faced Reagan?
When Paul Ryan and Rand Paul crow about
the virtues of slashing tax rates, they have it'the
back of their minds Arthur Laffer's total mis-
understanding of his own invention. In other
words, treat economists and policymakers who
cling to the supply-side doctrine with the same
respect owed to a chemist who thinks that phlo-
giston creates fire.

Senior forward Nkem Ezurike, now the new Michigan career scoring record holder, has helped build the women's soccer program into a national contender during her four years in Ann Arbor.
zurike: W t I have is
greater than anythin else

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
Senior forward Nkem Ezurike
sits on the-bench at the U-M Soc-
cer Stadium, looking out at the
field she dominates. Sunday, she
became the greatest goal scorer
ever to play at Michigan, in the
greatest era since the 1990s, on
perhaps the greatest team Michi-
gan has ever had.
It is dreary, quiet and empty,
except for a groundskeeper on
the field. The lights are off, the
bleachers vacant. That will all
change three nights later.
It wasn't always like this, the
confident dominance around the
program. When Ezurike came to
Ann Arbor, the rise of Michigan
women's soccer was in its infan-
cy. There was no stadium, no field
and no bench. The uniform she
wears did not exist, nor the nets
she hits with every goal, nor the
supporting cast alongside her.
Ezurike is outside the lines of
the field, so she is calm, unassum-
ing and soft-spoken. When she is
on the field, she is a terror, eager
to beat anyone in the way of her
journey.
"It's really funny to me because.
she's not like that at all off the
field," said freshman forward
Madisson Lewis. "She's such a
jokester, and she's always so calm.
She's a completely different per-
son on and off the field."
Ezurike sits here at the cross-
roads of two journeys: one to
become the greatest goal scorer
in Michigan history, the other
to take the Wolverines to the top
tier of women's soccer. The first
journey is over. The second? Well,
that's just getting started.
In 2008, Michigan coach Greg
Ryan's first season, assistant
coach Dean Duerst called Ryan
from a college showcase tourna-
ment in Canada with a message:
There's a kid up here you're going
to want to see.
Her name was Nkept Ezurike,
which is Nigerian, meaning
"What I have is greater than any-
thing else." She has lived up to
that name.
"If there's a player we need
to try to get into our program
as soon as we can, it would be
Nkem," Duerst said. "She also
was the right fit in terms of what
we call a target player."
In Ryan's first two years, Mich-
igan survived on 1-0 wins and
scoreless ties. The Wolverines

won four games in his first season
and six in his second, with just
one in the Big Ten each season.
He knew there was a ceiling
for his teams as long as they kept
playing like that. He needed a
natural goal scorer, like he had in
Abby Wambach when he coached
the U.S. Women's National Team.
In his first year, Ryan asked a
fellow coach how many Big Ten-
caliber players he had on his ros-
ter. The answer was one. His goal
was to rebuild the program, and
he knew if he could nab Ezurike,
that would be a start.
The coaching staff promised
Ezurike an immediate role on the
team - there was no adjustment
period. The journeyto the record
started then.
"I don't know if I ever put it in
perspective of that," said senior
midfielder Meghan Toohey. "But
I knew she was going to be by
far one of the best forwards this
program's ever had. When she
started scoring and scoring and
thinking about the record, I knew,
for sure that she was going to beat
it."
Ezurike is quiet about her
individual impact on the team,
but her teammates and coaches
aren't. They know the differ-
ence between Michigan with
and without her. The truth is,
the Wolverines go where Ezurike
takes them - from nine goals in
2010 for an NCAA Tournament
appearance, to 15 goals in2022 for
a Sweet 16 berth, to 10 so far this
year as Big Ten contenders.
But Ryan knew he needed
more than.a goal scorer. He need-
ed a team of leaders and pure, die-
hard competitors. Ezurike was
that, too: when she steps inside
the lines, a strange transforma-
tion happens. She goes from quiet
to loud, unassuming to assertive,
shy to fiery.
"She just becomes Nkem,"
Ryan said. "She becomes that
other Nkem that everybody loves
to see on the field."
A referee ignores contact
against her, and she yells across
the field to him. Another player
pushes her, and she gets into the
player's face. She misses a shot,
and she glares.
Why? Because they have one
thing in common: they're all in
the way of Ezurike's journey.
"In the previous years, all the
seniors had that sense of urgency,
like it was their last shot,"Ezurike
said. "You definitely don't under-
stand it until you're actually a
senior. It's kind of like despera-
tion, that urgency to do well and

end on a high."
Three years after she first
stepped onto the field as a fresh-
man, Ezurike is on her last go-
round. There is no next season, no
alternative to winning now.
Ezurike's career has not been a
smooth ride. Within every strik-
er is the pressure to score goals
and carry the team every game.
Ezurike needs to be a contributor,
and when she's not, it weighs on
her.
"I wouldn't say that it worried
her pulling her confidence down,,
but it definitely challenged her,"
Toohey said. "One reason Nkem is
as good of a player as she is, is that
she is hard on herself but doesn't
put too much pressure on herself
that takes away from scoring an
easy goal."
Ezurike said the hardest time
of her career was her sophomore
year, when Michigan returned
the bulk of its 2010 NCAA Tour-
nament team. Ezurike, of course,
expected more, perhaps a further
run into the tournament.
Instead, the Wolverines took
a step back: they finished just a
shade over .500, won four Big Ten
games and gave up three or more
goals four times.
Now, in the dark stadium,
the empty field seems emptier
when Ezurike thinks about those
moments, the moments that test-
ed Michigan's ability to rebuild.
"We knew we had the poten-
tial to be a really good team,"
Ezurike said. "Not being able to
execute, that was difficult and
hard to handle. We grew from it,
we learned from it and then we
went on to have a good season the
next year."
Ezurike's mother, Christie,
knows her daughter. She knows
how much pressure she puts on
herself.
"It was really tough because
(Ezurike) is sometimes too hard
on herself," Christie said. "When
the team is not doing well, she
gets really down. When that hap-
pened, she was disappointed. She
was a little bit hard on herself, but
she bounced back."
That was not Ezurike's last go-
round.
The next year, Ezurike missed
the first four games of the season
to play in the U-20 World Cup
for Canada in Japan. When she
returned from a 13-hourtime dif-
ference to a new team and a new

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Transition
year for
Michigan
By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's basket-
ball team performed far beyond
expectations last season - it raced
to the best start in program his-
tory by going 15-2, tied a pro-
gram record for wins with 22 and
earned a spot in the NCAA Tour-
nament, advancing to the second
round.
The Wolverines had a lot to be
proud of, but even more to worry
about. Michigan lost five seniors,
who together accounted for 84
percent of the team's scoring.
Beginning her second year as
head coach, the ever-optimistic
Kim Barnes Arico took to the podi-
um Tuesday afternoon to address
the media for the first time this
season. Right away, she called this
year one of transition and growth.
Official practices started just 15
days ago; and with four freshmen,
two transfers and only one return-
ing starter, there are still a lot of
unknowns about the team.
The Wolverines were given a
chance to play in Europe earlier
this summer, which gave Barnes
Arico and the coaching staff an
opportunity to experiment with
the lineup while also preparing
the young group for the adjust-
ment to college ball.
"Sometimes for the freshmen,
that's a big part chat's really dif-
ficult for them is the speed of the
game and the strength of the other
players that they're going to face,"
Barnes Arico said. "A lot of these
kids were coming off of ACL inju-
ries in the last year and didn't get
to play at all, so it gave them an
opportunity to get back on the
court before the official season
started."
The Wolverines will face an
array of challenges over the com-
ing weeks, and the coaching staff
faces the task of preparing both
their young players and their inex-
perienced upperclassmen to face
serious competition.
UNTIMELY INJURIES: Sopho-
more Kelsey Mitchell was a stand-
out rebounder in Europe and one
member of the team Arico was
expecting to make an impact after
missing all of last season with an
anterior cruciate ligament tear.
However, the forward recent-
ly suffered a broken foot that
required surgery and is expected
to sit out three to five months.
"That was obviously a horrible
blow to our program when we lost
her again, and I'm sure it's really
devastating to Kelsey as well,"
Barnes Arico said.
Mitchell wasn't the only Wol-
verine who battled ACL issues
last season - four Michigan play-
ers were confined to the bench in
2012-13 with knee injuries. Senior
forwards Val Driscoll and Ken-
dra Seto both return to the court
this year, but neither have had the
chance to play for Barnes Arico in
regular-season games.
SIZING UP THE COMPETITION:
A lack of size may be the biggest
issue the team faces this season,

with seven players listed at under
6-foot. But Barnes Arico has done
work to combat the issue, includ-
ing an atypical recruiting move to
land junior forward Nicole Flyer.
The story of Flyer's journey to
Crisler Center is a bit unortho-
dox. She's a junior walk-on, who
was previously a varsity athlete
at Michigan on the women's row-
ing team. Barnes Arico laughed
thinking back on how she sent her
coaches out on campus to find a
girl over 6-feet tall.
"We were in a position with
injuries that we needed somebody
that had pretty good size, so I put
my people on a mission," she said.
"We did our homework on her, she
came by the office, and she's been
incredible."
The team has also focused on
channeling its other strengths to
make up for the lack of height.
"We really put emphasis every
single day in practice on blocking
out, being able to chase balls down
and really doing a ton of drills to
make sure that we're trying to
work on that," Barnes Arico said.
"Pretty much every contest we're
going to be in this year, we're
going to be the smaller team, so
that's definitely a concern of ours."

Once a heckler, Nagelvoort
is just fine on the other side

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
As freshman goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort skated from the
bench to the Michigan crease
just minutes into the third period
of Friday night's game at New
Hampshire, hundreds of people
were calling his name. He was
excited, but nervous.
Ever since he was little, Nagel-
voort dreamed of putting on a
Michigan sweater. His grand-
parents have had season tickets
to Michigan hockey games, right
behind the opposing team's pen-
alty box, for longer than he can
remember. He says he was the
little kid always heckling the guy
in the penalty box. His grandpar-
ents didn't seem to mind.
But Friday, he was the one tak-
ing the heat from raucous fans
stacked directly behind his net.
There was never a question if he
relished every second of it.
"I absolutely love when there's
a student section right behind me
or something, ripping me apart,"
Nagelvoort said. "Nothing gets
me more fired up. Especially
when they call me by name, I just
love it."
When the Wolverines traveled
to New Hampshire last week-
end, they knew the crowd would
be similar to the rowdy folks in
Ann Arbor. It wasn't anything
new, except Michigan would be
on the receiving end of the hos-
tile chants. No one was more pre-
pared for their name to be called
by 1,000 screaming hockey fans
than Nagelvoort, though.
From his grandparents seats,
Nagelvoort used to watch Marty
Turco, Al Montoya and Shawn
Hunwick dominate the Michigan
crease at Yost Ice Arena. All eyes
were turned toward Nagelvoort
this weekend, though, after the
starting netminder, sophomore
Steve Racine, was forced to leave
the game with a groin injury.
The Wolverines tied New
Hampshire, 1-1, on Friday thanks
to Nagelvoort's 15 total saves in
the third period and overtime,
including a penalty shot that
hardly fazed him.

In mini mites, the youngest age that attracted national attention.

Nagelvoort went 8-1-1 with a .949
save percentage in his 10 games
with Aberdeen.
Michigan assistant coach Billy
Powers paid Nagelvoort a visit
in South Dakota to watch him in
person. After playing to Powers's
liking and sharing a good conver-
sation after the game, Nagelvoort
jumped at the chance to be a Wol-
verine.
"He's paid his dues to get to
Michigan," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
Copp remembers Nagelvoort
as a well-mannered, hard-work-
ing kid throughout their youth
hockey days. Copp was thrilled to
hear they would be in Ann Arbor
together when word of Nagel-
voort's recruitment came around.
"I actually went up to him the
other day, and t'm like, 'Who
would have thought when we
were playing mini mites that
we would be wearing Michigan
sweaters right now?'" Copp said.
"I love the spot we're in."
According to Copp, Nagelvoort
always had a good sense of humor,
and he still does. In practice,
whenever Nagelvoort catches the
puck, he usually throws the saved
puck directly back at the forwards
to let them know it's not in the net.
"Goalies are always a little
nuts," Copp said. "It can get a
little annoying when you want to
score goals and not him having
the puck thrown at you."
Dating back to the under-12
national championship with
Detroit Compuware - where
Nagelvoort played with Copp and
former Michigan defenseman
Jacob Trouba - Nagelvoort was
always a jokester with a knack for
staying loose in tense situations.
Last weekend was no different,
and all the practice he had pok-
ing fun at opposing players as an
elementary-school kid served as
preparation for the hostility he
faced in the seats behind his own
net at New Hampshire.
Nagelvoort says this past week-
end was the most fun he's ever
had playing hockey. In an arena
more than 850 miles from where
he and his grandparents always
sat in Ann Arbor, he felt right at
home.

thinking about how I could
draw and make funny situations
and make humor about femi-

women's rights, like what stupid

things that are done to us in our
culture that we can make light
of. And, by making light.of them,
then we can maybe see how

Donnelly came into her own
as an active, cartooning feminist
this past year when she served
as a cultural envoy on a trip to
Israel and Palestine, where she
spoke about the impact car-
toons can have politically and on
women.
This effort also reflects Don-
nelly's desire to connect with
the international cartoon com-
munity. Her website, World Ink,
showcases the work of cartoon-
ists from all over the world.
Donnelly has worked with car-
toonists from Europe, Australia,
Africa, South America and the
Middle East.
"It's interesting to see every-
body's perspective on the
world," she said. "I wanted to
have a place to showcase some of
these people's works."
Donnelly will come to Ann
Arbor to speak about her expe-
riences: from the internal and
external factors that have
morphed her view on the world
and the direction of her cartoons
to political activism and the cre-
ative process.
And maybe, if there's time,
she'll tell the audience about her
trouble with drawing cars, too.
"I don't draw cars very well,"
she said, laughing. "... They look
like boxes on wheels."

To say "The Good Wife"
is on a roll would be an
egregious understate-
ment.
The legal procedural, created
by husband-
wife dream
team Robert
and Michelle
King, is bar-
reling through
a narrative
streak that,
frankly, I can't KAYLA
recall ever UPADHYAYA
witnessing.
I can think
of a few dramas in recent years
that have similarly pulled awe-
inducing multi-episode streaks
out of their hats - the Defiance
arc on "Scandal," the second half
of "Orphan Black,"'s first season,
"Confessions" through "Ozyman-
dias" on "Breaking Bad."
But whereas these three "super
stretches" happen well into their
respective seasons, "The Good
Wife" isn't a slow burn: It's com-
ing outofthe gate at breakneck
speed. Never before have I seen a
show launch its fifth season with
so much energy and so few mis-
steps. In these first four episodes,
"The Good Wife" brings us back
into its richly drawn world, but
does so without forsaking the cru-
cial element of surprise that has
kept us intrigued for nearly four
years. Season five feels familiar
and heart-racingly exciting all at
once, and that's a balance most
TV dramas struggle with while
"Wife" dances around themwith
ballet-like elegance.
How do you keep viewers on
the edges of their seats five sea-
sons in when you're churning out
22 episodes a year and chained to
the FCC's regulations?"The Good
Wife" answers: easy peasy; cable
schmable; watch and learn.
So, let's back up a bit. The
show's mastery didn'tcome out
of nowhere. The creative forces
behind "Wife" have been laying
the groundwork to get here since
day one. At its base, the show is
still a legalprocedural, driven by
its case-of-the-week format, with
the occasionallonger arc woven
in. But the show's world is defined
first and foremost by its charac-
ters. It's one thing to have a lineup
of outstanding regulars, but "The
Good Wife" takes it to the next
level with the best roster of recur-
ring and guest performers on
television. Minor recurring char-
acters don't just add color or fill
space; they're part of the dynamic
and detailed fabric that seduces
viewersweek after week.

about how future disasters can

Despite its name, USAS is not

Past, present and future projects

However, USAS's main focus
this year is on sweatshops in

and he's allowing it to be attached

Vince Gilligan is a man you should

a fan favorite, and lawyer shows
have consistently been popular

Honestly, Odenkirk is talented
enough that I'd probably tune in
every week even if "Better Call
Saul" ended up adopting the for-

Order." But we all know there's
too much good material for that
to happen. In fact, the show being
a prequel opens all sorts of doors
for the writers to peek into if they
wish, including the possibility of
bringing Jonathan Banks back
to play beloved hit man Mike
Ehrmantraut.
"Better Call Saul" is not going
to be the next "Breaking Bad,"
(mostly because that title has
already been bestowed upon
"Low Winter Sun") but it doesn't
have to be. It's normal to be anx-
ious or skeptical, especially with
something as big as "Breaking
Bad" 's reputation on the line, but
Vince Gilligan's approval should
put fans at ease for the coming
months. "Better Call Saul" can be
independently successful and, in
that way, do its parent show jus-
tice.

thinking it was

* the fashion voyeur: leather looks

by adrienne roberts

Leather jackets have gone
through major changes - some,
quite awful - throughout the
this past decades. I remember getting
ill still weird stares as I walked into my.
Molly third grade classroom, unwill-
. And if ingly dressed by my mother is a
s sings stiff, blazer-shaped leather jacket.
Since then, I've had the impression
that leather either made you look
larticles like you're in a motorcycle gang, a
Sandy from "Grease" wannabe or
,. an S&M-loving dominatrix. How-
ever, in the past few years, leather
has become infinitely more femi-
nine, wearable and mainstream.
Leather has quite an interesting
and varied history. The material
first became popular for clothing
during World War I, when leather
jackets were created for practical
reasons - to protect aviators from
the elements when flying. Soon
after, women were wearing leath-
er leggings reminiscent of those
worn by the men on the frontlines.
In the late 1950s, the Greaser
subculture was born; a youth
movement that became a popular
expression of rebellion. In this
time, leather jackets were seen
as a fashion statement that meant
you ignored laws and were there-
fore dangerous.
Leather finally made it onto
the runway in 1960 when Dior's
24-year-old haute couture design-
er, Yves Saint Laurent, showed
leather jackets in their winter col-
lection. He was soon fired after
being heavily criticized that the
ZMAN/Daily jackets took away from the lady-

like tradition of Dior. Leather
jackets, at this point, were still
considered "gritty streetwear."
However, Saint Laurent's jackets
were sleek, cropped and fur-lined
- a huge departure from leather's
rebellious roots.
Leather jackets developed their
BDSM associations in the 1970s as
the Punk era developed in Brit-
ain. Vivienne Westwood, one of
Britain's most famous designers,
had the goal of bringing the dark
world of sex - including bond-
age and S&M - to the streets of
London. When the Punk move-
ment eventually became more
mainstream, many people in Brit-
ain and the United States could
be seen wearing leather jackets
adorned with safety pins and duct
tape. In this time, women were
trying to make a feminist state-.
mentcby wearing clothing thatwas
traditionally seen as more mascu-
line. For example, women would
wear a pink tutu, but add fishnets,
combat boots and a leather jacket
to the outfit.
We're now seeing a combina-
tion of Punk influences with the
more feminine leather jacket on
the runways of designers like J.
Mendel - a designer known for
his ethereal and luxurious cloth-
ing, who dresses the very girly
Taylor Swift. He showed a collec-
tion with many leather jackets.
His collection was described as
"biker chic." Alexander Wang's

N o, stupid, you're too old to
have fun!" At 16, this was my
life mantra, mostly because
it was my parents' response to anything
I wanted to do. It was always, "Karen,
you have to eat this and wear this and say
this." "Fun" to me was locking myself up
in my room, and escaping into the world
of Harry Potter - in the form of rereading
the books for the 77th time. Some might
have called me antisocial. I was fairly
satisfied with this perception of "fun",
though part of me wished I could have a
wee bit of a taste of being a teenager. In
my daydreams, I saw myself as Harry's
muggle parallel, and I was convinced that
I too would break free from my cupboard
under the stairs one day.
My opportunity came
two summers ago, when
the premiere of the final
Harry Potter movie,
"Harry Potter' and the
Dealthy Hallows: Part 2"
took place in New York
City. The weekend of the
premiere happened to be
when both my parents and $
my friend Ray's parents
were away. I knew that
weekend would be the
experience of a lifetime,
my rightful farewell to
Harry Potter and my
only chance to be a real
teenager.
We had exactly $200
for two people for three
days in the biggest city
in the world. Before
we could change our
tentative, adolescent
minds, we found
ourselves in front of the
bus station in Boston, bright and early
at 8 a.m. It might as well have been four
in the morning though, since I spent all
night tossing and turning in my bed.
I gave Ray a nervous glance, and he
returned the look. We carried a hot pink,
two-person tent and one small duffle
bag, crammed with our clothes and our
precious $200 cash.
"Ray, we are definitely fucking crazy," I
muttered.
"Last time I checked, I wasn't fucking
anyone named Crazy, but okay," was all
he replied, his face still. He grabbed my
arm and dragged me into the Lucky Star
bus ticket line. I wanted so badly to just
pull him back home, curl up in my room
where everything was always okay and
forget we ever planned this stupid trip.
But before I could do anything, before he

could change his mind, he blurted, "Two
round-trip tickets to New York City.
Return in three days."
Everything seemed to move in slow
motion as we shoved our bags in the
underside compartment of the bus and
stood with our tickets in front of the bus
door.
"Hey, you on or off?" the bus driver
yelled impatiently. I looked at Ray and
thought about all the nights we sneaked
onto Skype at 3 a.m., planning every tiny
detail of this trip. I remembered skipping
lunch every other day for the last four
monthsofsophomoreyear,justtoscrapeup
the measly money. But mostly, I remember
dreaming of this experience, almost peeing
myself with excitement in my sleep (yes,

wanted a nap more than anything in the
world. Was that too much to ask for? Was
it still too late to turn back?
As we trudged up the subway stairs,
we were immediately hit with the energy
of cheers and laughter all around. Before
we knew it, we found our small-town
selves in the midst of the massive Lincoln
Center, where suddenly, the dreadful
heat, hunger and exhaustion were all
forgotten. In front of our own eyes
was about half the world's wizarding
population, all dressed in robes and
carrying wands. The entire street was
lined with tents of every single color, all
crammed together on the sidewalk. A
boy no older than 10 shot past us, head-
to-toe in Harry Potter gear, glasses, scar

around and rewarded all of us for our hard-
core camping with ... red carpet tickets. Ray
and I started jumping up and down and
shouting. It seemed some dreams do come
true, even if they are the trivial wishes of a
teenage girl.
For the rest of the day, I laughed, I cried,
I screamed until my lungs gave out. On the
red carpet, I got a hug from Draco Malfoy,
an autograph from Hermione Granger and
I told Neville LongbottomthatI loved him;
I met the characters I grew up with and
watched the story I adored come to a close.
To me, the actors were still the characters
that taught me bravery, compassion and
acceptance. They were the ones who gave
me a magical childhood I wasn't forced to
grow out of.
As always, though, all
good things must eventually
come to an end. Before this
trip, I used to believe I was
so independent because
I was required to "grow
up" so quickly and forget
about fun. I never realized
how dependent I actually
was, merely waiting for my
next command. I've come
to learn that independence
is part rebellion; it's about
recklessly trying new
things, failing sometimes,
and in that process, learning
to live. Independence is
sometimes about camping
out on the streets of New
York City for a weekend to
meet a bunch of storybook
characters.
I suppose there are
two morals to this story.
First, though it's difficult
AN MULHOLLAND to admit, there is an
expiration date on blaming my parents
for missed opportunities, but there isn't
one on making a change in my life. If
Harry Potter has taught me anything,
defiance isn't about breaking all the rules
and blind disobedience; defiance is about
understanding myself and my limits, then
having the courage to step outside the
cupboard under the stairs.
The second moral is that Harry Potter
heals. Fangirlingheals. Or insimplerterms,
passion heals. When everything else in life
is drab, finding something worth giving
a shit about - that heals you. So thanks,
Harry, for casting "lumos" in my life and
for letting me see a bit of the world.
P.S. My parents still don't know about
this trip.

that is athing). Ray looked at me, and then
finally shouted, "We're on!" There was no
turning back now.
For the next three hours on the bus,
we played so many games of Hangman,
Pictionary, and tic-tac-toe that I still
heave at the sight of those games. We
had just begun to doze off when tall,
looming buildings flooded our line of
vision. The bus finally came to a halt.
This was it.
It was noon when we finally arrived at
the Lincoln Center station, after taking
the subway through a maze of hurried
business people and tourists who were all
slightly more agitated than we were and
who were cramped together because they
clearly enjoyed sharing body odor. Our
T-shirts stuck permanently to our backs,
and our throats screamed for water. I

lounged in their beach chairs with their
books propped open, or engaged in heated
trivia debates. Cheering fans held posters
crying, "Rowling is our Queen," "Thank
you for my childhood" and the classic
line, "I'd go sleazy for Ron Weasley."
And I knew right then and there, that
all the qualms and insecurities I had on
this trip would dissolve to become the best
experience of my short life. All of this shit
would be worth it. Screw the consequences;
we were going to live it up.

The 'U' in the 'D'
by Adam Rubenfire

t all started in 1817. Augustus Wood-
ward, Rev. John Monteith, Fr. Gabriel
Richard and William Woodbridge
forged a plan to establish the University of
Michigania. But many would be surprised
to know this story isn't set in Ann Arbor: It
takes place in Detroit.
The University was established in Detroit
in1817 and moved to Ann Arbor 20 years later.
While the University prospered, Detroit has
lost much of its population and economic
activity, and gained a national reputation as
an eyesore.
But today, there's a shift in this relation-
ship. Though many problems still exist, like
the aftermath of the city's historic bankrupt-
cy, it's now cool to live, work and play in the
city, from Corktown to Midtown.
There's little cool factor in the University's
presence in Detroit, according to admin-
istrators. Rather, they say the relationship
between the 'U' and the 'D' has been 196
years in the making.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the University's vice
president for government relations, said in
a statement that the University's support of
the city-is inherent if one considers that the
institution has had roots in Detroit since the
early 1800s.
"Even if the University had not been
founded in the city of Detroit, there would
likely be a type of interaction that you see
today," Wilbanks said. "But I would argue
that the bonds of the relationship are so his-
toric that it has helped to guide our interac-
tions with the city for many, many years."
Wilbanks - who has played a large part
in organizing the administration's efforts
in Detroit - said the University has been in
Detroit for some time and will continue that
presence.
Wilbanks said the recent spike in public
and private involvement in the city has only
made it more enticing for University research
and programs.
"There is a cool factor right now - it's
attracting students, and it's attracting more
companies to be a part of Detroit's rebirth.
Right now, we see many in the private sector
working hard to achieve success - and all of
that enthusiasm lends itself to a more vibrant
city," Wilbanks said. "I would make the case
that it makes it even more attractive for our
students and faculty to work in an environ-
ment where they can contribute to the city
thriving well into the future."
In recent years, companies have flooded
the city. Singer Kid Rock, a Detroit native,
capitalized on the city's recent fame with his
"Made in Detroit" clothing line. Several tech
companies, including Twitter and Uber - a
popular car hire app - have launched offic-
es in the city, and an array of startups have
popped up.
Chrysler announced they'll move 70
employees into the city, and even Chinese

companies have flocked to Detroit, attracted
by new automotive technologies.
Billionaire Dan Gilbert, chairman of Rock
Ventures, LLC, and Quicken Loans - the
nation's third-largest mortgage lender - will
soon own a large proportion of the downtown
area, which he has inundated with workers
from his family of companies.
Dan Mullen, vice president of develop-
ment for Bedrock Real Estate Services -
the real estate arm of Rock Ventures - told
MLive that companies and organizations
are moving to the city because they know
they'll be noticed as Detroit rebounds. He
pointed to New York-based Roasting Plant,
which opened one of its unique coffee shops
in Detroit earlier this year.
"If you were to open up another coffee
shop in downtown New York or Chicago,
you probably wouldn't be able to receive the
same amount of traction or PR or have the
same affect in general," Mullen said. "Folks
are realizingthis and taking advantage of it."
If, as Mullen says, moving to Detroit
means easy attention for businesses, is the
University attempting to follow the "Detroit
fad"?
Public Policy senior Donavan McKinney,
vice chair of the Central Student Govern-
ment Commission on Detroit Engagement
and a Detroit native, said it's possible that
work in Detroit could be used to create a pos-
itive image in the face of a poor racial climate
on campus and low Black student enrollment.
"I would hope the'University is doing this
just to promote awareness, and is conscious
of the fact that we have one of the most influ-
ential cities that has ever crossed the history
of cities," McKinney said.
McKinney said he supports the Universi-
ty's efforts, including the Detroit Connector
shuttle project, the weekend bus service to
Detroit he helped organize.
"I really don't feel that U of M is here for
show," Adell Austin Anderson, director of the
University's Detroit Center, said. "Because
it's been decades ... it has been here during
times where it wasn't 'cool' to be with Detroit,
when Detroit in the '70s was seen as the mur-
der capital of the world and stuff like that - U
of M was here in some form or fashion."

The Detroit Center - which opened in
2005 - is a visible symbol of the University's
involvement in Detroit. A large building sign,
lamppost flags and window art bearing the
iconic Block 'M' make the University's pres-
ence on the corner clear.
Anderson sees the Detroit Center more
as a headquarters - where University fac-
ulty, students and staff can get support for
their service and research efforts in the city's
many underserved neighborhoods. This is
evident in the University's opportunities for
students in Detroit. The Semester in Detroit
program began in 2009 and allows students
to live and study in the city for an extended
period of time.
Even as the city filed for bankruptcy this
past July, Craig Regester, associate director
of the Semester in Detroit program, told The
Michigan Daily he didn't believe students
would be dissuaded from studying in the city.
The University isn't the only college visi-
ble in Detroit. Midtown - where the Detroit
Center is located - is already home to a
major university - Wayne State University.
A few blocks down Woodward, Michigan
State University's Detroit Center is housed
in a two-story, 22,000 square-feet building
built in 1912, while the University's space
takes up only part of the first floor of an office
building. Even Grand Valley State Univer-
sity, a much smaller institution, has entered
the game, snatching a beautiful space in the
heart of downtown within clear visibility of
Conerica Park - and the appropriate adver-
tising signage to match.
Compared to its competitors, Anderson
said the University hasn't created a lot of buzz
about its presence in the city.
"The University has been here, but there
hadn't been this visible .symbol," Anderson
said. "We probably don'tdo agood enough job
in letting people know about everything that
happens here."
Elizabeth Birr Moje, Education profes-
sor and the School of Education's associate
dean for research and community engage-
ment, said the University does stand to ben-
efit greatly from its work in the city of Detroit.
But she's not referring to any sort of reputa-
tional benefit.

Moje said the University has shifted from
an effort focused on outreach to one that is
focused on engagement and service learning.
Rather than simply sending individuals to the
city to volunteer in underserved communi-
ties, faculty, staff and students in Detrit help
those in need and gain valuable educational
experiences.
"We have just as much to learn from our
service as we have to give," Moje said.
Education students and faculty work
directly with the Detroit School of Arts,
located down the street from the Detroit Cen-
ter. Along with a coalition of other campus
units, the school also works in several insti-
tutions around the area. The Undergradu-
ate Research Opportunity Program has also
begun offering research projects in Detroit,
Moje said.
In Moje's line of work, working in a city
like Detroit helps both teachers and research-
ers gain insight into a unique educational
environment.
"Doing research in Detroit provides one
with an opportunity to connect with people
who are really struggling with some of the
biggest challenges in our country right now,"
Moje said, noting that knowledge gained
could be applied to struggling communities
around the country.
In regards to practicum work, Moje called
working in a city like Detroit "the ultimate
teaching challenge," noting that it's exactly
where she wants her students. She said edu-
cators in Detroit are the best example of
teachers who are working extremely hard to
meet the needs of their students.
"If you're trying to learn how to be a teach-
er, part of what you're learning is how to be a
teacher in a particular context, and to figure
out, 'How do I work with a community that I
may not know well?"' Moje said.
Student leaders on campus agree. Public
Policy junior Patrick Sier, chair of the Central
Student Government Commission on Detroit
Engagement and major events director for
the Detroit Partnership service-learning stu-
dent organization, saidthatregardless of how
one looks at it, the University stands to benefit
from a healthy, vibrant Detroit.
"When you have a stronger, greater Detroit
region - which Ann Arbor is really a part
of - then you have a stronger University at
the same time," Sier said. "The University
acknowledges from a self-interest standpoint
that when Detroit rises, they rise, and when
Detroit falls, it hurts them too."
LSA senior Samantha Edwards, the Detroit
Partnership's executive director, said it's up
to students to give Detroit a chance.
"Students should at least try it out. You
can't count it out before you try it," Edwards
said. "College is a learning experience. It's
a time for you to experience a more diverse
atmosphere. It's about broadening your hori-
zons."

What we've seen in the past with
leather jackets are extremes. Women
either looked like subjects of dark,
sexual fantasies or Harley Davidson
biker chicks. Both looks, however, are
not exactly something you can show
up to class in. Now, leather jackets are
much more versatile. I think, finally,
that leather jackets have evolved into
a powerful, statement-making piece
without looking too sexualized or
overly-rebellious.

As of June 2013, Snapchat has removed
the facial expression from Ghostface Chillah,
as a result of a lawsuit disputing the original
founders of the app. Snapchat, currently worth
a self-reported $800 million by its investors,
faces an ongoing legal battle between three
Stanford graduates: Reggie Brown, Bobby
Murphy and Evan Spiegel, according to Busi-
ness Insider. Brown claims that Murphy and
Spiegel unfairly expelled him from the com-
pany, and in doing so, snatched away his role
as co-founder of the app. Furthermore, Brown
asserts that the original Ghostface Chillah
design was developed by him.
With the latest iPhone iOS update, Snapchat
released the following statement on its blog on
June 6: "Many of you have noticed that in our
latest iOS update, v5.0 Banquo, our mascot no
longer has a facial expression," the blog noted,
"This isn't because we forgot the face - it's
because you are the face of Snapchat." The blog
post further observes that the faceless mascot
more accurately portrays the "diverse experi-
ences" of the entire Snapchat community.
Despite changes to its mascot, Snapchat
has continued to offer its users with one main
quality: transience. Many users took advan-
tage of Snapchat's ephemeral, disappearing
photos by capturing themselves at their sup-
posed "ugliest." Some users intentionally took
"unattractive" pictures of one another - or of
themselves - and traded them. Double chins,
pursed lips and crossed eyes were documented
and sent at no risk, since Snapchat images are
designed to disappear.
Snapchat essentially offers its users what
other social media sites could not - a way to
interact with impermanence; a low-risk, per-
sonal statement of sorts. School of Information
Associate Prof. Clifford Lampe observed that
. Snapchat might not even fall under the category
of traditional "social media" sites.
"With most social media, you have public
statements that go out to people," said Lampe,
who is on the Board of Publications that over-
sees the Michigan Daily, referencing Twitter,
Facebook and Instagram. "Snapchat is pretty
direct communication, typically one-on-one."
Lampe acknowledged the existing history of
criticism against most social media.
"We've had a narrative for quite a while now
of 'How can young people be saying all this stuff
on Facebook and Twitter? Don't they realize it's
there forever?' Well, someone said, 'Let's make
an app where it's not there forever,"' Lampe said.
Thus, Snapchat fills a void in the social
media sphere of information thatvanishes, and
still maintaips active communication between
two people.
Snapchat also marks the recent change
in social media to a more visual-enhanced
culture. Communication Studies Prof. Scott
Campbell notes that the history of new media
was initially text-based.
"Now," he said, "the visual component is
becoming as important - or almost as impor-
tant - as textual-based communication."
Image-based communication has seemingly
heightened with the Millennials, a generation
comprised of people born 1980 to 2000. When
I log onto Facebook, my newsfeed blares with
photos ofcider mill donuts, kissy-face emoticons
and profile picture updates. On Instagram, a

friend poses, arms poised delicately, pretending
to hoist a patch of bulky pumpkins. And scroll-
ing down Tumblr, snapshots from the "Break-
ing Bad" finale clutter my screen. These days,
it's hard not to find a communication outlet that
lacks images. After all, we are primarily visual
creatures. We like to see.
Engineering junior Raj Vir, a hacker and web
designer, believes technology's high-quality.
cameras make Snapchat's visual qualities all the
more appealing.
"You can convey a lot in texts, but obviously
you can convey way more in pictures," he said,
"Like the old saying goes, 'A picture is worth a
thousand words,' and now phones with high-
quality cameras allow good communication."
And yet, the rise of images has not dimin-
ished other ways we talk to one another,
according to Campbell.
"I'd consider (the visual) as an added layer
of communication ... it's not taking away from
other forms of communication," he said, "This
visual component is communication."
In 2009, Campbell, one of the contribut-

build our relationship."
Snapchat can thus be used to reaffirm and
upkeep social relationships - a way to virtually
tap on the shoulder or hug.
"What's really important and good about
(Snapchat) when it launched was that it wasn't
necessarily about the app itself,"Vir said, "It was
the network of friends you had on the app. You
talked to, at most, 10 friends. Every Snap you got
was hand-picked for you."
Campbell agrees.
"When you reach out to somebody with a
Snapchat, that's a symbolic gesture," he said.
"That's an affirmation that you're thinking of
somebody, and they're in your social circle."
It seems the app has taken on a different pur-
pose other than swapping selfies. Snapchat has
been used to document experiences and share
rather mundane moments. Snapchats aren't
onlylimitedto portraits of people.I'vebeen sent

Cats. More cats. Slabs of fudge, with the caption

chat seems like a way for users to record experi-

"When you reach out to somebody with
a Snapchat, that's a symbolic gesture.
That's an affirmation that
you're thinking of somebody,
and they're in your social circle."

Prof. Scott Campbell

However, Vir acknowledges that Snapchat
itself is not an app that demands a lot of screen-
shot preservation: "They're pretty low-quality,
random pictures."
The very nature of Snapchat photos then,
is meant to deteriorate. But is Snapchat usage
meant to last in the long run? It's hard to pre-
dict. As of Oct. 3, Snapchat launched a new
feature titled Snapchat Stories, which allows
users to create a 24-hour Snap narrative by
combining together various Snaps that last on
a 24-hour cycle.
Vir believes Snapchat Stories disturbs the
simplicity of the app.
"Snapchat is ridiculously simple (as opposed
to picture messaging). You just open it up, and
the camera is right there," he said,"'Stories' adds
alot of distractions to the app. It's less personal.
I disagree with it."
And yet another element could get in the
way of Snapchat's legacy: mom and dad. Camp-
bell notices a consistent trend that'll determine
whether or not various communication platforms
ultimately survive among the young generation.
"There's a little bit of a cat-and-mouse
game going on. Young people are hopping
onto some of the new channels of new media,"
he said, "Once the grown-ups get on and pay
attention to what they're doing, it loses a bit
of its cultural capital for young people. It
loses some of its coolness, and they move onto
other new things that older generations will
eventually hop onto."
Take Facebook, for example. After Facebook
caught onto the older generation of parents,
grandparents, bosses and teachers, the Millen-
nials began "reducing their Facebook activity
in leaps and bounds," Lampe said. "One thing
young people like to do is maintain the boundar-
ies against old people."
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all,
we're generationally different from one another,
as well as positioned at different psychological
stages of development.
"The biggest psychological consequence
(Snapchat has) is that it does help a younger
generation, especially a college-age generation,
to establish their own identities and differenti-
ate themselves from one another," Lampe said,
"Part of establishing identity is thinking: What
does it mean to construct myself? How do I con-
struct my identity around social circles? What
audience am I presenting myself to?"
Whereas previous generations illuminated
their identities through more visceral avenues
of clothing, or music choice, Millennials have
another mode of expression: online imaging-
mediums such as Snapchat.
"It's all about how you use these tools,"
Lampe said, "If I communicate positive mes-
sages and wish you a good day, that might
make us both happy. But if I just communicate
anger or sarcasm, that might be detrimental to
our happiness."
As Snapchat is relatively new, it may be too
early to tell. There is currently no established
scientific research on the app, although both
Campbell and Lampe predict studies to come
in the near future.
In the meantime, walking through the Diag,
I spot numerous others raising phones to their
faces; to the squirrels; to the wet, reddening
leaves; caught in a continuous Snapping frenzy. 4

ing authors to a "Teens and Mobile Phones,"
revealed that two main modes of cell phone
usage in teens are text messaging and sending
photos to one another.
"We correlated (cell phone usage) with peer-
to-peer interaction, and there was a positive cor-
relation," Campbell said.
So, even when young people are not together,
they're not necessarily replacing their face-to-
face interactions with digital ones. They're, as
Campbell puts it, "filling in the gaps."
In 2013, an app like Snapchat - that has the
ability to both capture and dissolve the visual -
seems to fulfill a desired need.
"I think we've always wanted to appreci-
ate and share moments in ways that are not
archived," Campbell said. "People are not inter-
ested in archiving everything permanently.
The archiving of our experiences online could
become overwhelming to some."
Not only overwhelming, but meaningless. On
my Facebook newsfeed alone, it seems pointless
to upload the eight iPhone photos I took of my
diner breakfast from various angles, with dif-
ferent color effects. Rather, Snapchat is a way
of privatizing communication, and accessing
control. Furthermore, it helps "socially groom"
relationships, accordingto Lampe.
"Snapchat helps younger people keep con-
trol of a message," he said, "When I Snapchat
to somebody, it's me signaling I'm spending
my limited attention on them, which helps

ences rather than selfie-shots.
"I think it might just be the case of people
using Snapchat more often," Vir said, "Previ-
ously, you might've just used it to send pictures
of your face, and now it's just moments."
These shared moments - documented
through Snaps that disappear - mimic the true
nature of ephemeral time.
"The idea of ephemeral conversations that
go away and disappear fulfill a deep need for
people," Lampe said, referencing the "Right
To Be Forgotten" movement in Europe, where
Internet users of sites like Facebook and Google
campaign for the basic right to not have perma-
nently-stored information preserved online.
The basic need for information to disap-
pear - to be forgotten - is increasingly advo-
cated as a necessity. So in regards to the future,
Lampe believes the ephemeral "feature is
going to be important."
And while users seem to embrace the tran-
sient nature of Snapchat, it's easy enough to take
a screenshot of a Snap, saving it forever into one's
camera roll. Traditionally, Snapchat friends are
notified if a screenshot of their image is taken.
However, Vir figured out a way to combat the
problem earlier this year through a hack that
would eventually earn him fame in the web
world. Vir discovered that one could save a Snap-
chat screenshot withoutiletting the user get noti-
fied. Simple: a user double-taps the home button
on their smartphone after taking a screenshot.

Frum the passenger's seat, I can see
everything: grass, McDonald's, speed
signs we're ignoring, food advertise-
ments we're not, the slender arc of the
interstate, hung like a gray-swept sheet before
us. "Road trip!" my sister hollers from the driv-
er's seat, her palm grazing the wheel. "Hey, we
should Snap somebody."
Reaching for my iPhone, I scroll until I
reach my most used app. The signature ghost
mascot beams up at me, its tongue poking
out of its mouth as if to suggest we're both

the insiders to some hideous secret joke. I
tap. My iPhone camera pops out, and - in
true selfie-mode - I pucker up in front of the
camera, duck-facing it, and press the button.
The October light splashes across the camera
lens, obscuring my face with shafts of glitter.
Typing in a quick caption, I caps-lock, "FALL
BREAK! ON OUR WAYYY" and check the
green boxes of all my Snapchat friends, send-
ing to as many people as I can.
My sister and I are currently two out of the
estimated 8-million registered Snapchat users,

who are cumulatively trading approximately
350-million images daily. The free image-mes-
saging phone application designed by two Stan-
ford University students in 2011 is a hit among
smartphone users. It allows users to send photos
and videos to each other that disappear after a
chosen period of time - users can set the image
for anywhere between one to ten seconds. Users
can additionally create captions and use a draw-
ing tool to embellish photos with hand-drawn
accents. Snapchat users thus communicate with
one another by giving and receiving "Snaps" -

images or videos which both capture and illu-
minate the embarrassing, the ordinary and the
"selfie" of every day.
With the intent to allow users to "have fun"
written into its Terms of Usage, Snapchat was
welcomed into the social media sphere as an
amusing, even humorous app used to take
funny shots of yourself, or of friends. Even
its famous ghost mascot, named "Ghostface
Chillah," after the Ghostface Killah of the
Wu-Tang Clang, suggestively implies a light-
hearted, easygoing tone.
