Vice President of Student 
Life E. Royster Harper, is 
retiring from the University 
of Michigan after 20 years in 
her current position.
In 
an 
email 
to 
the 
University 
community 
Thursday morning, Harper 
announced her retirement, 
which will be effective at the 
beginning of the Winter 2020 
semester. She cited wanting 
to spend more time with her 
family and enjoying other life 
pursuits as the reason for her 
retirement.
“I read a statement recently 
that said, ‘Life is too precious 
to be anything but deeply 
alive in it.’ For me that means 
moving from my current 
role that I have cherished 
over these past 20 years, and 
spending more time with 
my family and life’s other 
pursuits,” 
Harper 
wrote. 
“Thus, it is with deep gratitude 
that I am announcing my 
retirement, 
effective 
Jan. 
17, 2020. While this was an 
incredibly difficult decision to 
make, I am ready and excited 
for this next adventure.”
As 
vice 
president 
of 
Student Life, Harper works 
closely with several student 
organizations such as Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness Center, Fraternity 

& Sorority Life and the 
Trotter Multicultural Center. 
In an email statement, 
University President Mark 
Schlissel thanked Harper for 
her service with the broader 
Michigan community for the 
past two decades.
“During the five years I 
have known her, I’ve been 
continually 
impressed 
by 
her 
thoughtful 
and 
innovative 
leadership 
on 
important issues,” Schlissel 
wrote. “In particular, she 
has spent all of her time at 
U-M working to improve 
the 
student 
experience, 
particularly for those who 
are underrepresented, and 
she has led groundbreaking 
sexual misconduct prevention 
efforts 
and 
empowered 
survivors to report, recover, 
and seek justice.”
Faculty 
and 
student 
leaders 
on 
campus 
who 
have 
previously 
worked 
with Harper describe her 
commitment to prioritizing 
student voices. Julio Cardona, 
director 
of 
the 
Trotter 
Multicultural Center, detailed 
how Harper’s dedication to 
the University’s student body 
has spanned over her decades 
of service.
“Dr. Harper has committed 
her 
career 
to 
making 
a 
positive difference in the 
lives of generations of U-M 
students,” Cardona said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Marijuana 
use 
by 
college 
students 
hit 
a 
35-year 
high, 
according to a study released last 
Tuesday. The annual Monitoring 
the Future panel study, a joint effort 

by researchers at the University’s 
Institute 
for 
Social 
Research, 
found that, in 2018, 43 percent of 
full-time college students said they 
used marijuana at least once in the 
previous year, while one in four said 
they had used it in the last 30 days. 
The national survey also showed 

that binge drinking and other types 
of illicit drug use had decreased 
among college students. 
The study surveyed 1,400 adults 
age 19 to 22, including 900 who 
were full-time college students and 
approximately 
500 
non-college 
youth. Principal investigator John 

Schulenberg put it bluntly: He 
noted that prevalence levels for 
marijuana use have not been this 
high for three-and-a-half decades, 
when 45 percent of full-time college 
students in 1983 said they had used 
marijuana in the last 12 months.

The University of Michigan 
Transportation Research Institute 
released a report detailing methods 
to quantify motion sickness in 
automobiles in August. With the 
conversation on driverless vehicles 
growing, motion sickness has been 
a concern, since one out of three 
people is highly susceptible to 
motion sickness according to the 
National Institutes of Health.
UMTRI Director James Sayer, 
an adviser to the project, said the 
autonomous car industry talks 
about how these cars would free 
up time for passengers, allowing 
them to even watch movies. 
But motion sickness needs to be 
addressed before this idea can be 
made into reality, Sayer said. 
“The idea that you could have 
a fully autonomous vehicle drive 
you to work while you get work 
done or watch a movie … that’s 
something that the industry has 
been pedaling for some time,” 
Sayer said.

Symposium discusses psychedelic 
therapies, neuroscience impact

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Neuroscience graduate student Emma Trammel presents research findings at the Psychedelic Neuroscience and Therapy Symposium in the Rackham Thursday. 

Keynote speaker Rick Doblin takes a trip to Rackham, discusses ongoing projects

On 
Thursday 
in 
Rackham 
Auditorium, about 200 attendees 
listened to experts on psychedelic 
neuroscience 
share 
their 
research and the vast potential 
for psychedelic therapies to treat 
patients 
with 
mental 
health 
disorders. 
The 
“Psychedelic 
Neuroscience 
and 
Therapy” 
symposium was hosted by the 
University of Michigan’s Center 
for Consciousness Science.
Psychedelic science and therapy 
go far beyond the familiar party 

drugs characteristic of the 1960s. 
Researchers and advocates aim 
to sway public opinion away from 
entrenched taboo stereotypes and 
toward decriminalization. 
Originally 
characterized 
as 
hallucinogens, psychedelic drugs 
are known for inducing states of 
psychosis or altered perception. 
Many 
drugs 
like 
MDMA 
(commonly known as ecstasy) 
and LSD were discovered in the 
early 20th century. These drugs 
were used for research purposes 
in their infancy, and it wasn’t until 
the 1960s that their recreational 
use became popularized. This 

led to mass criminalization of 
psychedelic substances by the 
FDA and the development of their 
illicit social stigma. 
The keynote speaker of the 
event was Rick Doblin, founder of 
the Multidisciplinary Association 
for Psychedelic Studies. Through 
MAPS, Doblin has dedicated 
himself to popularizing a more 
positive and scientific view of 
psychedelics. 
Doblin 
introduced 
several 
ongoing projects investigating the 
healing potential of psychedelic 
drugs. One aimed to use MDMA 
as a treatment for post-traumatic 

stress disorder. The brains of 
people suffering from PTSD are 
altered to respond dramatically 
to fear triggers and to think less 
logically. 
“MDMA changes the brain too, 
but does it in the opposite way,” 
Doblin said. “It increases activity 
in the frontal cortex so that people 
can think logically about these 
things and not get triggered so 
easily.”
Doblin discussed studies which 
show promising healing potential 
for MDMA in other disorders.

A group of University of 
Michigan 
students 
recently 
launched 
Michigan 
Political 
Consulting, the first political 
consulting 
organization 
on 
campus. 
The 
non-partisan 
organization works with various 
state and national campaigns 
and currently comprises of an 
executive board and a small 
consulting team. 
MPC Vice President Sam 
Burnstein, an LSA sophomore, 
said the group was founded to 
fill a gap in opportunities for 
campus involvement. 
“There are over a dozen 
different business consulting 
groups that are well known 
and highly coveted by students 
pursuing 
those 
careers,” 
Burnstein 
said. 
“But 
there 
wasn’t even one for politics or 
campaign work.”
LSA senior Rachael Freedman 
is interested in campaigning 
and was intrigued by MPC’s 
mission.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
Working with VP Royster Harper has been one of the best 
aspects of my term as president... She has been a fierce advocate for the 
Panhellenic community and I cannot imagine where we would be today 
without all of the support she has given us. The Panhellenic community 
wishes her all the best in her retirement. I feel very privileged to have 
gotten a chance to work with VP Harper during my time as President.”

Taylor Fegan, president of the Panhellenic Association and LSA senior 

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA junior Elizabeth 
Lawrence wrote about her experience covering gun violence as a 
both as a student journalist and a professional reporter.

“This summer, I was working as an intern at USA Today, and there 
was that back-to-back shooting. And I was just really upset about it, 
and needed an outlet to deal with reporting on that all day. I feel like 
that day in March [when U-M experienced a false-alarm shooting 
situation] also really affected me, and I had pushed it to the back of my 
brain, so that’s why I wrote the piece.”

Environmental Working Group releases 
report about PFAS in drinking water

Activist organization adds 90 contaminated sites to list, including those in MI

Drinking water supplies at 
108 Army and Army National 
Guard 
installations 
are 
contaminated with per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, 
or PFAS, according to a report 
released by the Environmental 
Working Group on Wednesday. 
Contaminated sites include 
Grand Ledge Army Aviation 
Support and Jackson Readiness 
Center in Michigan. The report 
added 90 installations to the 
existing 18 which were known 
to have contamination.
PFAS are a wide variety 
of 
chemicals 
produced 
by 
manufacturing, 
industrial 
and 
agricultural 
processes. 
In Michigan and some other 
states across the country, PFAS 
is a growing threat to drinking 

water. Ann Arbor residents 
have 
become 
increasingly 
concerned 
with 
the 
levels 
of 
PFAS 
contamination 
in 
Washtenaw County, especially 
in the Huron River. Last 
May, the city launched a 
transparency 
initiative 
to 
detail updates on water quality. 
The 
EGW’s 
data 
was 
obtained from the Department 
of Defense under the Freedom 
of Information Act. Since 2016, 
the total number of current and 
former contaminated military 
installations rose from 207 
to 297. The report detailed 
the negative effects of PFAS 
chemicals 
and 
their 
reach 
across the U.S.
“Low 
doses 
of 
PFAS 
chemicals have been linked 
to 
cancer, 
harm 
to 
the 
reproductive 
and 
immune 

systems, thyroid disease and 
other health problems,” the 
report said. 
“The chemicals have been 
detected 
in 
the 
drinking 
water of 19 million Americans 
in 49 states, and unreleased 
EPA data show that up to 110 
million people may have PFAS-
contaminated drinking water.”
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
released 
a 
statement on Wednesday in 
response to the report.
“PFAS is a serious national 
health 
problem 
and 
every 
day we find more and more 
of 
our 
nation’s 
service 
members are being exposed 
to 
PFAS,” 
she 
said. 
“The 
Environmental 
Working 
Group is doing valuable work 
to expose the extent of the 
contamination. We must be 
serious about identifying 
contamination, cleaning it 
up, and preventing further 
contaminations 
and 
dangers going forward.” 
Dingell 
said 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense 
must stay transparent and 
be held accountable in its 
role in PFAS contamination. 
She mentioned the National 
Defense Authorization Act, 
which was passed by the 
house in July. It includes 
three 
amendments 
by 
Dingell addressing PFAS. 
“The House passed a 
strong National Defense 
Authorization 
bill 
that 
included a number of my 
amendments that will help 
clean up the nearly 300 
military 
sites 
identified 
with PFAS contamination 
— including designating 
PFAS as hazardous. With 
the EWG’s new findings, 
it’s even more critical that 
PFAS provisions in NDAA 
make it into the final bill,” 
Dingell’s statement reads. 

The 
amendments 
added 
by Dingell designate PFAS 
chemicals 
as 
hazardous 
substances in order to qualify 
them for clean up under the 
EPA’s superfund program. The 
amendments also ban the use 
of PFAS materials to produce 
ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, 
consumed by servicemen and 
women in training and require 
that military bases cooperate 
with state regulation if PFAS 
contamination is detected near 
the installation. 
LSA senior Sophia Simon, an 
Ann Arbor native, emphasized 
the importance of protecting 
and preserving our natural 
resources. She believes that the 
University has a part to play 
in educating students about 
local environmental issues, as 
well as preserving sustainable 
practices. 
“I 
grew 
up 
near 
the 
Huron River and have been 
swimming in it for years, but 
PFAS contamination poses a 
big threat to the river water 
quality,” Simon said. “The 
University 
should 
invest 
in keeping our river clean, 
because it’s such a beautiful 
and important part of Ann 
Arbor.” 
LSA junior Kellee Byard, who 
is enrolled in the University’s 
Program in the Environment, 
called for urgent action against 
PFAS contamination. 
“I think this issue is vital 
for both local and regional 
administrations to act urgently 
and aggressively, because PFAS 
affects drinking water and also 
resides in the environment,” she 
said. “This is harming humans 
and organisms within nature, 
overall 
creating 
unhealthy 
ecosystems resulting in a slew 
of health risks. We must stop 
the production of contaminants 
that ultimately end up in our 
water.”

KATHERINA SOURINE
Daily Staff Reporter


“Dr. 
Harper 
has 
done 
this through an innovative 
student-centered 
approach 
that has been modeled at 
other 
higher 
education 
institutions throughout the 
nation.”
Panhellenic 
Association 
president Taylor Fegan, LSA 
senior, said working with 
Harper on FSL matters was 
a privilege. 
“Working with VP Royster 
Harper has been one of the 
best aspects of my term 
as president,” Fegan said. 
“She is dedicated, kind and 
one of the biggest student 
supporters 
on 
campus. 
In working with her, it is 
so 
clearly 
apparent 
that 
she loves the University 

of 
Michigan, 
but 
more 
importantly she loves the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students.”
Izzy Baer, former vice 
president of Central Student 
Government, echoed those 
sentiments as she looks back 
fondly on her time working 
with Harper. 
“(Harper) made herself 
extremely accessible to the 
CSG executive team through 
our term,” Baer said. “More 
so, Royster always ensured 
that student decisions and 
actions were autonomous, 
she worked hard to advocate 
and advise, while always 
maintaining student voices.”
Harper was also known 
for being a champion of 
diversity. She helped create 
the new Trotter Center on 
Central Campus and is on 
the executive board of the 

Ann Arbor branch of the 
NAACP. 
Baer 
said 
Harper’s 
commitment to equity and 
inclusion made a mark on 
the University.
“Her 
commitment 
to 
diversity and inclusion on 
campus 
reverberated 
to 
every corner of campus,” 
Baer said. “I hope to see the 
new VP prioritize revising 
our 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy, 
expanding 
mental 
health resources on campus 
and 
continuing 
Royster’s 
legacy with a commitment 
to DEI.”
Cardona also discussed 
how having a vice president 
of 
Student 
Life 
who 
prioritizes 
diversity 
is 
essential.
“A 
commitment 
to 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion is a priority for 

the University of Michigan. 
As such, it is important to 
continue the work of Dr. 
Harper and other leaders 
across 
the 
campus 
of 
supporting all students in 
intentional ways as part 
of our efforts to foster an 
inclusive campus climate,” 
Cardona 
told 
The 
Daily. 
“Additionally, it is important 
that all members of the U of M 
community, including those 
who are underrepresented, 
are 
provided 
equal 
opportunities to thrive and 
excel.” 
Along 
with 
student 
organizations, 
Harper 
oversaw 
the 
University 
Health 
Service. 
Earlier 
this month, Harper, along 
with other administrators, 
responded to the student 
backlash 
over 
an 
added 
fee for testing for sexually 

transmitted infections. The 
University 
then 
reversed 
its 
policy 
after 
students 
created an online petition 
demanding the University 
eliminate STI testing fees. 
“You 
have 
helped 
us 
understand 
just 
how 
important it is to maintain 
confidentiality 
in 
this 
process all the way through 
how those tests are paid 
for,” Harper wrote in an 
email explaining the policy 
reversal to students. “We 
would 
never 
want 
the 
payment process for these 
important 
medical 
tests 
to stand in the way of any 
student accessing important 
medical services or testing.”

“We’ve done some small 
pilot 
studies 
with 
other 
indications, 
including 
social 
anxiety in adults on the autism 
spectrum,” Doblin said. “We’ve 
done work with MDMA for 
anxiety associated with life-
threatening illness.”
After dedicating his life to 
researching psychedelic drugs, 
Doblin spoke on the progress 
made since he was inspired to 
start MAPS. 
“The FDA is now going to 
create guidance and documents 
if you want to do psychedelic 
research,” Doblin said. “This 
idea of trying to bring our 
different selves together — 
bring the psychedelics out into 
the open — it’s working and 
what we’re doing is making 
MDMA into a medicine.”
LSA junior Nick Lemaster 
expressed his own long-term 
interest in the topic, as he was 
originally inspired by a pilot 
study that used Psilocybin to 
minimize withdrawal effects 
of alcoholism.
“I just think it’s a fascinating 
new 
frontier 
of 
research 
in terms of psychological 
treatment,” Lemaster said. 
“It’s an avenue that hasn’t 
been explored much, and it’s 
also an experience that hasn’t 
been researched much.” 
LSA senior Briana Johnson 
spoke on the potential to 
embrace this new type of 
therapy. 
“Keeping 
your 
options 
open and not turning away 
from things that people say 
are inherently bad or add to 
the degradation of society, 
you 
shouldn’t 
turn 
your 
back on things that could 
potentially 
help 
people,” 
Johnson said. “As more and 
more people start to see 
that it’s beneficial, it might 
be more mainstreamed and 
have the potential to be more 
regulated.”
Rackham 
student 
Nick 
Denomme presented research 
on the history and discovery 
of LSD and its key role in 
understanding the function 
of serotonin in the brain and 
mental illnesses. 
“The 
remarkable 
effects 
of LSD evolved our thinking 
about neurochemistry and the 
etiology of mental illness,” 
Denomme 
said. 
“These 
discoveries really helped us 
steer psychiatry away from 
psychogenic 
models 
and 
develop chemical models of 
mental illness.” 
Katrin Preller, a researcher 
at Yale University, presented 
her work on the therapeutic 
potential 
of 
the 
psilocybin 
mushrooms, 
or 
magic 
mushrooms. 
“Alterations 
in 
social 
cognitions are core symptoms 
of many psychiatric disorders,” 
Preller said. 
Preller 
described 
the 
profound 
impact 
social 
rejection and exclusion has on 
psychiatric patients. She also 
explained the potential for 
Psilocybin to lessen this. 
“Psychedelics 
reduce 
the 
processing 
of 
negative 
information — under Psilocybin 
they report reduced feelings of 
being socially excluded,” Preller 
said, 
referring 
to 
patients 
in a study with borderline 
personality disorder.
Rackham 
student 
Emma 
Trammel 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
increasing 
public 
awareness 
in 
her 
presentation. 
“So often we have these 
science 
conferences 
that 
just aren’t accessible to the 
general public, so it’s just 
scientists telling scientists 
about what they did, when 
what we really need to focus 
on is telling the general 
public about the work that 
we’re doing so that they trust 
that we know what we’re 
doing and they have reason to 
support us,” Trammel said. 
LSA 
senior 
Christopher 
Fields, 
who 
attended 
the 
symposium, 
expressed 
his 
excitement at the prospect of 
exploring this new field. 
“The 
therapeutic 
use 
of 
psychedelics 
halted 
and 
became a standstill in the late 
60s,” Fields said. “The fact that 
U-M is hosting this event is a 
huge indicator of revamping 
psychedelic research.” 

That 
same 
year, 
26 
percent said they had used 
marijuana at least once in 
the last 30 days.
Schulenberg also noted 
the 
dramatic 
increase 
in 
vaping 
nicotine 
and 
marijuana 
among 
college 
students, 
particularly 
among the percentage who 
said they had done so at least 
once in the previous year.
“For both of those, annual 
use increased,” Schulenberg 
said. “Both of those doubled 
or more than doubled in just 
one year, and we hardly ever 
see that happen as we track 
substance use.”
Among college students, 
the 30-day prevalence of 
vaping marijuana rose from 
5.2 percent in 2017 to 10.9 
percent 
in 
2018. 
Vaping 
nicotine increased as well, 
with 
30-day 
prevalence 
going from 6.1 percent in 
2017 to 15.5 percent in 2018 
in “one of the largest one-
year proportional increases 

for any substance over the 
past 40 years.”
Vaping 
nicotine 
also 
increased 
among 
non-
college respondents, going 
from 7.9 percent in 2017 
to 12.5 percent in 2018. 
Schulenberg 
said 
it 
was 
rare to see higher nicotine 
use among college students 
compared 
to 
non-college 
youth, adding that people’s 
perception of harm tended 
to 
impact 
usage 
levels. 
Historically, 
according 
to Schulenberg, when the 
survey 
recorded 
higher 
levels of perceived harm 
associated 
with 
using 
a 
substance, prevalence levels 
tended to be lower. 
“And it depends how you 
think about it, but people 
risking their health is bad,” 
Schulenberg said. “The good 
news is, for example, binge 
drinking 
among 
college 
students is at a record low. 
That’s for the first time ever 
below 30 percent, so there’s 
a significant drop, just in the 
past year in binge drinking 
among college students.”
LSA senior Eric Terbush 

is 
a 
member 
of 
Green 
Wolverine, 
a 
student 
organization that promotes 
knowledge 
of 
the 
legal 
aspects 
of 
the 
cannabis 
industry. Terbush said while 
the increase in cannabis 
consumption among college 
students 
was 
statistically 
significant, 
it 
should 
be 
considered 
alongside 
the 
“displacement 
of 
alcohol 
consumption.”
“I think that overall ease of 
access to cannabis, increased 
interest 
in 
personal 
health and perceptions of 
cannabis’s safety are all key 
elements in the increase in 
consumption among college-
age demographics,” Terbush 
said. 
“The 
real 
question 
is if this displacement is 
an 
overall 
net 
positive 
or 
negative 
on 
student 
health. While alcohol has a 
measurable death toll, the 
social costs of cannabis are 
much more opaque. I think 
this study overall confirms 
longer trends in substance 
abuse.”
Schulenberg 
said 
researchers 
were 
still 

trying to figure out if the 
decrease in binge drinking 
was associated with the 
increased 
use 
of 
other 
substances like marijuana.
“Scientists 
are 
asking 
that 
more 
and 
more,” 
Schulenberg 
said. 
“They 
call 
it 
substitution. 
It’s, 
‘OK, 
well, 
they’re 
going 
to get high on something,’ 
so, first they’ll want to use 
something 
that’s 
readily 
available, 
and 
basically, 
marijuana is always readily 
available. Perhaps there’s 
more opportunity to use it, 
and perhaps the perception 
is it’s not such a big deal, 
and 
maybe 
people 
are 
substituting. The research 
is not there yet, so we don’t 
know, but it’s definitely a 
good hypothesis.”
L.J. 
Horowitz, 
Green 
Wolverine 
President 
and 
Kinesiology 
senior, 
said 
increased use of marijuana 
should 
be 
viewed 
as 
beneficial.
“The increase in marijuana 
use among college students 
should be noted as a positive 
for 
both 
the 
cannabis 

industry and society as a 
whole,” Horowitz said. “It 
is imperative for readers to 
know that the report, more 
importantly, 
indicates 
a 
significant drop in abuse of 
other illicit drugs — alcohol 
and opiates — due to using 
cannabis as a substitute.”
Schulenberg added that 
the 
study 
also 
found 
a 
decrease in reported usage 
of 
narcotics 
other 
than 
heroin, saying that public 
health efforts to combat the 
opioid epidemic may prove 
effective in curbing other 
addiction crises.
“We’re seeing declines in 
that among, not just college 
students, but also same-age 
people who are not in college, 
and 
that’s 
great 
news,” 
Schulenberg said. “I mean, 
these can be horrible drugs, 
so what I want to say is that 
public 
health 
campaigns, 
getting information out, can 
turn things around. We can 
be proactive and turn things 
around, and I think that 
applies to the vaping.”

“I believe that Michigan 
Political Consulting offers 
a 
niche, 
yet 
incredibly 
valuable, 
opportunity 
to 
Michigan 
students,” 
Freedman said. “I think 
political consulting would 
give 
students 
access 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
political 
perspectives, offices, causes 
and operations compared to 
one internship or job.” 
The group works with 
various Michigan campaigns, 
including Senator Elizabeth 
Warren’s 
presidential 
campaign, 
Jon 
Hoadley’s 
congressional campaign for 

Michigan’s 60th district and 
Alberta Griffin’s state House 
campaign 
for 
Michigan’s 
61st district. Hoadley is a 
Democrat, first elected to 
the House of Representatives 
in 2014. Griffin is also a 
Democrat 
and 
served 
a 
previous term in the state 
House, before being defeated 
in 2018. 
MPC 
Recruitment 
Co-Chair and LSA junior, 
Taylor 
Smith, 
said 
the 
group has to adapt to each 
campaign’s specific requests, 
but in general MPC works 
on social media, polling, 
fundraising and more. 
“Every client will have 
a different set of needs,” 
Smith said. “But the work 

generally includes making 
social media posts for them, 
doing graphic design, data, 
polling, fundraising — a lot 
of different things.”
Burnstein 
talked 
specifically 
about 
MPC’s 
work 
for 
the 
Warren 
campaign and how they got 
connected. 
“We got in touch with 
someone from the Warren 
campaign,” Burstein said. 
“She expressed an interest 
in working with us, and she 
connected us to the youth 
political director. He was 
keen on having us set up 
student 
groups 
on 
other 
campuses across the state of 
Michigan.”
Though 
MPC 
says 

they’re 
a 
non-partisan 
group, 
the 
majority 
of 
their current clients are 
Democratic 
campaigns. 
Burnstein emphasized that 
the group is happy to work 
with both Republican and 
Democratic 
campaigns, 
but 
acknowledged 
the 
difficulty of finding an 
ideologically 
diverse 
membership. 
“By the nature of being in a 
college town, it begets a lot of 
progressive and democratic 
voices, which is the main 
composition of our executive 
board, 
unintentionally, 
of 
course,” Burnstein said. “I 
think it has been difficult 
recruiting 
students 
with 
non-mainstream voices and 

views.”
Freedman agreed having 
a 
group 
with 
diverse 
perspectives and ideologies 
is 
important 
in 
political 
organizations. 
“It is absolutely vital to 
incorporate 
individuals 
from all political ideologies 
at 
one 
table,” 
Freedman 
said. “Executing effective 
political 
leadership 
and 
best representing those who 
elect an official is done with 
a diverse representation of 
ideologies present.” 
The 
group 
hopes 
to 
grow this semester while 
providing 
quality 
work 
for their clients. They are 
receiving applications until 
Sept. 1.

“ 

Some say the world will 
end in fire, some say in 
ice,” as poet Robert Frost 
once said. However, I believe 
there are three threats that 
will be humanity’s downfall: 
food, 
waste 
and 
blood. 
Unfortunately, the “friendly 
little bubble” around Ann 
Arbor is not enough to shelter 
the city from the plague of 
collegiate 
food 
insecurity, 
food waste and national blood 
shortages. At first glance, it 
may seem these public health 
threats belong in different 
categories and should inspire 
separate solutions. However, 
there 
is 
an 
intersection 
between all three of these 
issues that would provide the 
opportunity to create a single 
solution that could combat 
all three problems at once. In 
other words, I am betting that 
you can kill three plagues with 
one stone. Before I make my 
case for a solution, I figured 
I ought to break down each 
problem first. 
First 
and 
foremost, 
I 
understand that college is an 
investment for your future. 
However, it is ridiculous for 
an investor to go hungry in 
order to see a return on their 
investment. 
Nevertheless, 
according to a 2015 study by 
Nikki Kasper, “41.4 percent 
of U-M students had low 
to very low food security.” 
Low food security is defined 
by 
the 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services as “the disruption 
of food intake because of 
lack 
of 
money 
and 
other 
resources.” 
Unfortunately, 
the 
University’s 
response 
to this issue has been less 
than urgent. In recent years, 
multiple 
food 
pantries 
on 
campus allowed students to 
scramble alongside hundreds 
of peers once a month to 
secure free food in what can 
only be called the actual 
Hunger Games. According to 
The Daily, starting in fall 2019, 
Maize and Blue Cupboard 
food 
pantry 
will 
begin 
offering daily distribution of 
nutritious food and produce 
at a permanent location on 
Central 
Campus. 
However, 
the question still remains as 
to whether these efforts alone 
can satisfy all the hungry 
students on campus.
Luckily, 
on 
a 
college 
campus, 
where 
there 
is 
scarcity there is also surplus. 

According to MLive, in the 
spring of 2018, Sava’s did not 
have enough dumpsters to 
hold all of its waste. It doesn’t 
take a master’s degree to 
understand that a good portion 
of that waste was leftover 
food. I recognize that not all 
food waste can be recovered 
safely. If food is no longer 
safe for human consumption, 
of course, a restaurant should 
responsibly dispose of it or 
compost it. However, not all 
food is unsafe for consumption 
when it is thrown away. It 
seems 
rather 
ironic 
that 
dozens 
of 
restaurants 
and 
cafes like Sava’s are throwing 
away food every day when they 
are just steps from a campus 
where more than 41 percent 
of students are food insecure. 
Sava’s is only one of dozens 
of local restaurants and cafes 
that benefit from the endless 
foot traffic the University 
of 
Michigan 
supplies 
to 
keep their businesses open. 
Consequently, it would be 
worth asking them to donate 
leftover food back to local 
students who need it the 
most and give it back it to 
the community that supports 
their bottom line. 
Beyond 
just 
food 
insecurity, there is also a 
constant 
need 
for 
blood 
donations. It seems that every 
summer there is a drought of 
blood donors, largely due to 
the fact that school is out and 
a great deal of students no 
longer make time to donate. 
According to a U-M Health 
Blog post, these “nationwide 
blood shortages … (leave) 
doctors 
and 
emergency 
room personnel without the 
resources for some surgeries 
and procedures.” 
In essence, students have 
the blood and empty bellies 
while 
local 
restaurants 
have the food and should be 
motivated by the prospect 
of giving back. I propose 
creating a digital platform 
that 
enables 
students 
to 
subscribe to reserve and pick 
up extra food that would 
otherwise go to the landfill 
from 
restaurants 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Instead 
of 
money, 
however, the subscription fee 
for this service would be to 
donate blood regularly, every 
two months throughout the 
year and particularly during 
the summer and winter when 
blood 
shortages 
are 
most 

likely to occur. If students 
don’t 
qualify 
as 
blood 
donors, perhaps they could 
donate their time at blood 
drives or solicit someone 
to donate in their name to 
satisfy 
the 
subscription 
fee. Restaurant employees 
could identify students who 
are active donors through a 
special discount card mailed 
to them every two months 
or a smartphone QR code 
sent to the students’ email. 
According to Kasper, some 
studies 
have 
found 
that 
limited free time and lack of 
transportation may also be 
barriers to food, so perhaps 
the digital platform could 
provide delivery to students 
for a small fee.
When it comes to public 
health issues, extra food 
pantries established by the 
University 
are 
not 
going 
to be enough. As a student 
body, we have the power to 
take matters into our own 
hands and problem solve. As 
a society, when we examine 
public 
health 
issues, 
we 
often section them off, try to 
isolate their specific causes 
and 
brainstorm 
solutions 
independent from each other. 
Such a practice is as outdated 
as the bubonic plague itself. 
When studying public health 
issues 
independently, 
it’s 
easy to fail to see the big 
picture 
or 
recognize 
how 
they can intersect. It’s kind 
of like trying to navigate to a 
new location by only looking 
at a fraction of the map. If 
most of your map is covered, 
then you are going to miss 
an intersection that could 
make it easier to get to your 
destination — which, in this 
case, is hungry students, less 
landfill waste and reduced 
blood shortages. The reality is, 
if you are willing to challenge 
conventional 
thinking 
and 
break the silos we keep around 
separate public health threats, 
you will find connections. 
Public health is far too complex 
an issue to try to isolate 
problems. 
Turns 
out 
that 
mapping out a social venture 
that can combat public health 
threats is as simple as finding 
the connection between public 
health problems. Who knows, 
maybe your next social venture 
is just an intersection away.

Collegiate food insecurity is the key to blood security

E

arlier this week, Maine 
made headlines as the 
state’s legislature passed 
a bill introducing a substantial 
electoral reform to the state’s 
presidential 
primaries 
and 
elections. The bill institutes ranked-
choice voting, a system that allows 
voters to rank their preference 
of candidates for a position and 
takes all of these preferences into 
account in the final result. In short, 
ranked-choice voting is likely to 
lead to elections that better reflect 
voters’ preferences, allow for more 
diversity of candidates and reduce 
vote-splitting. Recognizing this, 
Democratic parties in six other 
states have plans to implement 
measures similar to Maine’s in their 
upcoming presidential primaries.
Also, this month, the field of 
possible Democratic presidential 
nominees was effectively cut in half. 
Out of the 20 candidates present on 
the stage of the second debate, only 
10 met the requirements for polling 
and donations set by the Democratic 
National Committee to qualify for 
the third. With the Iowa caucus 
still far off, similar polling cut-offs 
are likely to be used by the DNC 
to further narrow the field in the 
future.
Watching these two events 
occur in tandem, it seems strange 
that the moves being made by 
Maine Democrats to reform actual 
elections haven’t been reflected 
in these debate qualifiers. In the 
weeks since the second debate, the 
polls used in the DNC’s cut-offs 
have served as a sort of pre-election, 
defining the candidates that voters 
will and will not get to choose in the 
future. And while the 10 candidates 
eliminated in this round were all 
unlikely to win, these polling cut-
offs will become much higher 
stakes as the field narrows. This 
is especially true for the “second 
tier” of candidates — those who are 
not frontrunners but have a shot at 
becoming one in the future. At this 
point, that’s essentially everyone 
other than former Vice President 
Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., and Sen. Warren, D-Mass. 
These candidates may be victims 

of the same problem that Democrats 
in Maine and other states are trying 
to solve with ranked-choice voting. 
In one of the polls used by the 
DNC to determine the candidates 
for the third debate, CNN asked 
respondents to indicate both their 
first choice for a nominee and 
the candidate that they are next 
most interested in hearing from. 
The results show an enormous 
discrepancy between voters’ first 
and second choices, revealing some 
candidates to be significantly more 
popular than they initially seem. 
For example, in April polling, Sen. 
Kamala Harris, D-Calif., garnering 
only 5 percent of first-choice votes, 
beat out the three frontrunners 
by being listed as 23 percent of 
voters’ less preferred choice. In fact, 
almost all candidates other than the 
frontrunners appear substantially 
more popular once second choices 
are taken into account, while Biden 
and Sanders seem to perform worse.
Essentially, this indicates that 
while most voters prefer Biden, 
Sanders or Warren as their top 
choice, many of them wouldn’t 
choose one of the other three 
frontrunners as their second choice. 
Another one of the qualifying polls 
confirmed this: Morning Consult 
explicitly asked supporters of the 
top candidates to indicate their 
second-choice preference. About 
half of supporters of the top three 
candidates did not list one of the 
other three frontrunners as their 
second choice.
This means that the results of 
subsequent polling cutoffs may 
be significantly different between 
traditional 
and 
ranked-choice 
voting mechanisms. While I wish 
I could tell you how the results 
would be different, the problem 
of ignoring voters’ second-choices 
is too entrenched to allow that. 
None of the polls used by the DNC 
published detailed results of voters’ 
second choices, and most of the ones 
I looked at didn’t ask about second 
choices at all. 
Ultimately, this problem extends 
beyond the cut-offs for the primary 
debates and into the way we cover 
and discuss elections. Polls aren’t 

just hurdles for candidates to jump 
over on their way to the debate 
stage. They are also one of the 
primary ways voters, politicians and 
commentators try to understand 
what is going on in elections. The 
results of polls can go viral, thrusting 
candidates into the spotlight and 
giving their prospects a boost, as 
happened when a single poll earlier 
this month contradicted all others 
by finding Warren tied with Sanders 
and Biden among Democratic 
voters. Furthermore, the campaigns 
themselves are influenced by polling 
data in developing their messaging 
and policy.
If polls ignore voters’ second 
choices, they can make some 
candidates, like Harris and Mayor 
Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., 
seem substantially less popular 
than they actually are (and others, 
like Sanders, more so). If polls 
only incentivize candidates to 
make attention-grabbing, radical 
statements to accumulate more 
first-choice followers, it may lead 
them to ignore building a broadly 
supported 
platform 
that 
will 
actually get people out to vote in the 
general election.
At a time when the Democratic 
party is increasingly fractured, 
and winning the general election 
has never seemed more important, 
these could be costly mistakes. 
The good news is that substantive 
change need not wait on the 
lengthy legislative processes faced 
by states like Maine attempting to 
institute ranked-choice policies in 
actual elections. The DNC could 
immediately 
require 
qualifying 
polls to ask more questions about 
voters’ second and third choices. 
Even if subsequent debate cut-
offs 
don’t 
use 
ranked-choice 
mechanisms, altering the polls 
alone would instantly deepen our 
understanding of the election and 
the public conversation about it. 
Doing so now, before the field 
narrows further, could shape the 
outcome of both the primaries and 
the general election.

Debate qualifying polls should use ranked-choice voting

The Trump administration’s attack on reproductive rights

JARED STOLOVE | COLUMN

T

hese days, it feels like 
barely a week goes by 
without President Donald 
Trump’s administration enacting 
another barrier for women making 
personal family planning decisions. 
The most recent is somewhat dry 
and complicated but still undeniably 
dangerous for women’s health. 
In 1970, the Title X funding 
program was signed into law by 
President Richard Nixon. This 
program provides funds for clinics 
across America to help offer family 
planning and other reproductive 
health 
services 
to 
low-income 
communities. Forty percent of the 
people served by Title X funding 
receive their care through Planned 
Parenthood clinics. 
This, however, is about to change 
due to a new directive from the 
Trump administration. In February 
2019, the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services issued a new 
rule that bars any organization 
receiving Title X funding from 
referring 
patients 
to 
abortion 
providers. After months of court 
battles, this change has been allowed 
to go through. 
Planned Parenthood has likened 
this new policy to a gag rule and said 
that they cannot accept any more 
Title X funds if doing so will prevent 
them from referring their patients to 
abortion services. 
This withdrawal from Title X by 
Planned Parenthood is set to have a 
detrimental impact on low-income 
communities across Michigan and 
the United States at large. Planned 
Parenthood provides nearly 40 
percent of patients under Title X 
funding, delivering much-needed 
care to nearly 1.6 million Americans 
annually. 
Planned Parenthood of Michigan 
has said the loss of Title X funding 
will have a major impact on the 
state. Currently, 70 percent of Title 
X services in Michigan are handled 
by Planned Parenthood. The loss of 
Title X funds is estimated to impact 
42,000 Michiganders who receive 
low-cost 
health 
services 
from 
Planned Parenthood. This loss of 
care will be felt especially in certain 
counties, such as right here in 
Washtenaw County, where the only 
health care facility offering Title X 
coverage is Planned Parenthood.

While abortion opponents have 
accused Planned Parenthood of 
playing 
politics 
with 
women’s 
health, the real fault lies in the 
hands of the Trump administration 
for implementing this dangerous 
law, knowing full well the negative 
impact it will have.
Despite Planned Parenthood’s 
warnings about the potential loss 
of Title X funding following the 
gag rule, the Trump administration 
pushed ahead with this policy, 
leaving Planned Parenthood no 
choice but to back out. 

The importance of Planned 
Parenthood 
being 
allowed 
to 
refer patients to abortion services 
cannot be overstated, especially 
given the recent rise in misleading 
crisis pregnancy centers. Crisis 
pregnancy centers are organizations 
that push false narratives to try 
to coerce women into not having 
abortions. In 2015, The National 
Abortion Rights Action League 
witnessed this firsthand during an 
undercover investigation of crisis 
pregnancy centers in California. 
NARAL reported workers at the 
crisis pregnancy centers telling 
patients patently false information, 
including that abortion is linked to 
breast cancer and infertility, neither 
of which is true. 
These centers often advertise 
online and make it seem as if they 
are impartial organizations. For 
women dealing with the stress of an 
unwanted pregnancy, it can be hard 
to determine which organizations 
are legitimate abortion providers 
and which are not. 
This action is another example 
of 
the 
Trump 
administration 
putting partisan politics ahead of 
the health of Americans. Whether 
it be attempting to defund Planned 

Parenthood or this new directive, 
this administration has been 
relentless 
in 
chipping 
away 
reproductive health care. 
This 
laser-like 
focus 
on 
restricting reproductive health 
care is emblematic of the rapidly 
changing 
Republican 
party. 
Republican 
President 
Richard 
Nixon signed this legislation into 
law, but that has not stopped the 
Republicans of today from gutting 
the law. As the Republican party 
becomes more conservative, we 
see ordinary people who simply 
want control of their bodies caught 
in the crosshairs. This is especially 
true with Title X funding, which 
has helped so many people. 
The funds used from Title 
X provide services desperately 
needed by so many Americans, from 
birth control to cancer screenings. 
In fact, a 2010 study concluded that 
the Title X program was highly 
effective and prevented 2.2 million 
unintended pregnancies, 99,100 
cases of chlamydia and 410 HIV 
infections. These numbers prove 
the importance of these services 
and the sheer backwardness of the 
Trump administration’s new rule.
As students, we cannot sit by as 
millions of Americans lose their 
access to this critically important 
care. Though Planned Parenthood 
is committed to making up for this 
major loss of funding, this will be no 
small feat, especially in Michigan. 
Currently, Planned Parenthood 
is “deprioritized” for receiving state 
funding. If you feel strongly that this 
is not all right, then write to your 
state representatives, get involved 
with abortion groups here on 
campus and, most importantly, vote, 
not only in the presidential election 
but also in down-ballot races. 
Here in Michigan, many of our 
fellow citizens are at risk of losing 
their care. This cannot stand. 
We must continue to raise our 
voices against this new policy and 
advocate for the state of Michigan 
to allocate more funds to help make 
up the difference in Title X funds. 
This is the only way to ensure all 
Michiganders have access to the 
health care they deserve.

For as long as music streaming 
services have existed, I have resisted 
the call to join them. I’ve argued 
with friends, family and in this 
column that streaming music is bad 
for artists, bad for the consumer and 
bad for listening. In many a long car 
ride I’ve ranted against what I call 
“media socialism”: the idea that no 
individual should purchase songs or 
movies and instead should subscribe 
to an ever growing number of media 
streaming services. The whole thing 
has always made me uncomfortable 
and left me imagining a 1984-esque 
dystopian future in which there 
are only a few conglomerates with 
sole control over the distribution 
of all media. It would be as if there 
were no copies of books outside of 
libraries, and all of the libraries 
were privatized. That future could 
still come to pass and still scares 
me. But after two back to back road 
trips with friends in which Spotify 
was used almost constantly to recall 
practically any song one could 
think of, I began to feel, at long last, 
the allure of the music streaming 
service.
The truth is that sticking to my 
archaic ritual of manually dragging 
songs from my iTunes library to my 
iPhone like it was 2006 has become 
less and less feasible as time has gone 
on. This summer Apple announced 
that they were planning to phase 
out iTunes entirely and while this 
news shocked me at first, when I 
looked around and realized I was 
literally the only person I knew who 
still used the application, it began to 
make a bit more sense.
Faced with the death of iTunes 
and the increasing feeling that I was 
depriving myself of quality listening 
time by having to look up songs on 
YouTube and listen to ear-splitting 
YouTube ads while biking around 
campus, I began to think that joining 
Spotify might not be the worst 

decision I’d ever make. Why had 
I fought against it all these years? 
Was it really because I hated “media 
socialism?” I’d had a Netflix account 
all these years, hadn’t I? It’s not like 
I was buying every song I listened 
to, I was ripping them from CDs or 
YouTube videos. I was nothing more 
than a stubborn hypocrite, too lazy 
to switch from my old ways and 
too stubborn to admit I was wrong 
once I’d committed to the “media 

socialism” bit. I stuck it out with 
my archaic ways out of nothing less 
than ignorance. All these years I’d 
deprived myself of the ability to 
listen to whatever music I wanted, 
whenever I wanted. And at a student 
price of $4.99 a month with Hulu 
included? I must have been truly 
insane to not sign up the day I 
decided to come to Michigan.

So I did it. I got Spotify. I’m one 
of you now. I’ve given in to media 
socialism and allowed myself to 
become just another person in the 
crowd. And within just a few short 
weeks I’ve found myself wondering 
how I ever lived without it. To think 
that I was once concerned with 
storage space on my iPhone and 
whether or not new updates to iTunes 
would mess up my sync settings. I 
mean, Spotify has practically every 
song ever. It’s actually insane. It’s 
amazing what the human brain 
can compartmentalize and twist 
to suit its own purposes. For years 
whenever I heard of Spotify my first 
thought was just “oh, I don’t use 
that,” and I never once considered 
why I didn’t use it, what I was 
missing or if I was making a big 
mistake. But I’ve changed. I’ve fully 
converted to the church of Spotify, 
and never again will I irritate my 
cousins, friends or club members by 
insisting that physical media is the 
only true path.
And yet there is still something. 
A vague discomfort that I barely 
acknowledge, save in that liminal 
space between waking and sleeping. 
Perhaps my intuitions were correct, 
perhaps Spotify is in fact the work 
of the corporate devil, designed 
to entice and entrap. Or perhaps 
I’ve simply spent so long decrying 
it that I’m experiencing cognitive 
dissonance now that I’ve joined. I 
listened to Spotify the entire time 
I wrote this article. They say that 
absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
They also say that human beings 
struggle to choose when faced with 
a multitude of choices. In this new 
media landscape, where any song, 
film, or television episode ever made 
is accessible to us at every minute 
and every moment of every day, 
do we still appreciate art the way 
we once did? In gaining access to 
everything, have we lost something 
along the way? I wonder about this, 
and so many other things, and then 
I go ahead and add a few more songs 
to my queue.

Ian Harris: It took years, but
I have been seduced by Spotify

ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

Roy Blair wants his new EP Graffiti 
in the hands of Timothée Chalamet. 
Quite literally, there is no better 
project 
for 
Chalamet’s 
personal 
narrative. Blair’s second track on the 
EP, “Franzia,” fuses synth-pop with 
an electronic dance beat that creates 
an aura that I would call the “Study 
Abroad in France” space. Graffiti 
launches listeners into the auditory 
equivalent of taking transcendental 
humanities classes while Timothee 
Chalamet invites you to fall in love 
with 
the 
French 
electro-dance 
clubbing scene. Blair is a young 
heartthrob (despite his claims about 
having a punchable face) and with 
Graffiti he has shed his sprightly skin, 
evolving into a detailed-focused artist 
who wants to make music and then 
disappear. The Chalamet bells are 
RINGING. 
Lime green is Blair’s choice for his 
newest hair color and for Graffiti’s 
cover art; the electricity of lime 
perfectly matches Blair’s emergence 
into a fusion of synth-pop electronic 

rap. The lime green visualizes a 
phoenix mentality, a new flair for crazy 
syncopation and impressive synths. 
Graffiti follows Blair’s debut coming-
of-age album: Cat Heaven, which Blair 
released when he was 20 (he is now 
22) in an ode to his cat, Gary, who 
passed. Cat Heaven was a DIY project 
known for its nostalgic happiness 
and 
appealing, 
melodious 
raps, 
which allowed Blair to score a spot 
as Kevin Abstract’s opener. Graffiti 
launches Blair out of the fresh-faced 
cat mourning phase and into elevated 
lyricism with more tricky, embedded 
meaning. These lyrics flourish with 
the support of producers Slaters and 
Sasha Daze, who effectively drag 
Blair out of his bedroom rap and into 
Pharrell-inspired production. 
Graffiti fires up interest in its 
impeccable 
production, 
but 
falls 
in its lack of cohesiveness, which 
is to be expected in a 3 track EP 
preceding a full sophomore album (to 
be released in 2020). The production 
flows seamlessly among the tracks, 
but their themes seem to ping-pong 
with personal identity quarrels and 
ills of relationships. That being said, 

the atmosphere created is gripping 
in every sense — it seems to move 
effortlessly between clubs, liquid 
and solitary confinement. The track 
“I Don’t Know About Him” uses off-
beat rhythmic stresses to unsettle 
the listener, creating a dull feeling of 
standing in line, waiting for something 
a tad too long. The track closes with 
the glory of what seems to be an angel 
playing the piano underwater. The 
dance scene track “Franzia” is the sort 
of song that bounces back and forth 
from your right headphone to your 
left headphone with a high pitched 
autotune that resembles the mocking 
SpongeBob meme where EVerYtHinG 
SoUNdS LiKe tHiS, a voice-cracking 
that embodies vulnerability in every 
sense.

Stay awake for Roy Blair’s
electro-rap fusion ‘Graffiti’

FILM NOTEBOOK

SAMANTHA CANTIE
Daily Arts Writer

The main purpose of “After the 
Wedding” is to be a showcase for 
its three principal actors, veterans 
Billy 
Crudup 
(“Where’d 
You 
Go 
Bernadette”), Julianne Moore (“Bel 
Canto”) 
and 
Michelle 
Williams 
(“Venom”). Williams plays Isabelle, 
an 
American 
ex-pat 
running 
an 
orphanage in India who travels to 
New York seeking funding from 
the wealthy entrepreneur Theresa, 
played by Moore. Isabelle is invited 
to Theresa’s daughter’s wedding, and 
a flurry of secrets and family drama 
unfold 
in 
the 
ensuing 
weekend. 
Theresa’s 
husband 
(played 
by 
Crudup) turns out to be an old flame 
of Isabelle’s. At the wedding, Isabelle 
discovers that the young woman 
getting married is in fact her and 
Oscar’s daughter, who she believed 
she had given up for adoption over 20 
years ago.

The premise is intriguing, and 
the actors all have enormous talent 
and impressive resumes. The film 
has all the hallmarks of a prestige 
drama, the kind that crackles with 
tension 
and 
brilliantly 
rendered 

screaming matches. And yet, despite 
the juiciness of the conceit and the 
caliber of the actors anchoring the 
piece, absolutely nothing in this film 
captures the attention or imagination 
of the audience.
“After the Wedding” takes its 
time — or rather, it takes too much 
time. It stretches languorously like 
a cat, puttering around aimlessly 
from toothless scene to toothless 
scene. It’s a film about uber-wealthy 
people who have sprawling estates 
just outside Manhattan and work in 
glass offices on the 40th floors of 
skyscrapers. There’s a minor tension 
between Isabelle’s discomfort with 
the grandeur of Theresa and Oscar’s 
life and the casualness with which 
they spend money on hotel suites 
and wedding meals. But ultimately, 
the film relaxes into the opulence. 
I’d estimate a third of the runtime is 
spent with the camera slowly roaming 
the halls of its sets, lingering on 
the gorgeous kitchens and massive 
sofas with all the subtlety and 
emotional resonance of a Pottery 
Barn commercial. The remaining two 
thirds of the film are spent watching 
people we are given no reason to care 
about tearfully clutching shawls to 
their chest and arguing their way 
through their complicated situation 
with dialogue that’s as clunky and 
sparsely written as the characters 
themselves.
The problem at the heart of the 
film isn’t that the story is fragile 
(though it is), or that the characters 
are thin and poorly rendered (though 
they are). The problem is that “After 
the Wedding” is bad in the worst 
possible way a piece of media can be 
bad: it’s bland and inoffensive. It’s 
milquetoast, airy, completely free of 
any identity, substance or personality. 
It was a deeply unpleasant viewing 
experience, but not the kind of 
unpleasant that’s at all interesting 
to unpack or provides any kind of 
insight into what makes films tick. 
It simply fails at creating stakes, 
tension or compelling characters. The 
result is a movie that clocks in at just 
under two hours but feels like it lasts 
anywhere between seven and nine. 
But who knows? “After the Wedding” 
could very well find a new audience 
out of theaters — perhaps it simply 
can’t fill the dramatic demands of a 
big screen. Maybe it will find a new 
life being watched by half-asleep 
passengers on planes, or filling a mid-
afternoon time slot on TV, playing in 
the background while people clean 
their houses. Maybe that’s where it 

‘After the Wedding’ is
absolutely middling

ALICE LIU / DAILY

You can’t really put a label on what 
kind of band Snarky Puppy is. Although 
they’re often billed as a jazz band 
and play in a variety of jazz idioms, I 
wouldn’t really call their music jazz. I’m 
not sure if I’d even call them a fusion 
or a jam band. The only thing I can 
definitively say about the band is that 
it’s a supergroup of some of the best 

instrumentalists in the world. Founded 
in 2003, this Texas-born ensemble 
returned to Hill Auditorium this past 
Sunday for the opening of the University 
Musical Society’s 141st Season.
The night kicked off with opening 
act Alina Engibartan, a vocalist and 
keyboard 
player 
accompanied 
by 
three other members of Snarky Puppy. 
Engibartan’s voice on both originals and 
jazz standards was a smooth way to ease 
into the energy of the main event.
Touring off of the release of their most 
recent album, Immigrance, the band 
mostly played new music, with a few 
favorites sprinkled in between. Many 
of these newer pieces were influenced 
by different types of music from all over 
the world. For example, Michael League, 
bassist and bandleader of the group, 
mentioned the influence Gnawa music 
had on the group after their recent trip 
to Morocco and then taught the audience 
how to clap an interesting three-over-
four polyrhythm to accompany the 
band on their new track, “Xavi.” These 
worldly influences aren’t completely 
new for Snarky, but the way they leaned 
into them more than their last visit to 
Hill was captivating.
For the most part, this new recipe 
tasted pretty good in the listener’s 
mouth. The addition of violinist Zach 
Brock added some textures that differed 
greatly from the traditional funk/fusion 
the group is famous for, but at times 
the music did feel like it was only going 
halfway. Certain songs like “Even Us” 
ventured deep into unknown territory 
for the band, while other songs like “Bad 
Kids to the Back”seemed like they could 
have come from any period in Snarky’s 
discography. It felt as if the band was 

teasing us with a new direction and then 
immediately returning to where they 
had come from.
Objectively, the band sounded great. 
However, as much as I did appreciate 
the group trying to do something new 
with their new songs on this tour, I 
really wish they would have leaned even 
further into it. This was my third time 
seeing Snarky Puppy, and don’t get me 
wrong, each time I’ve seen them I’ve 
been blown away. The group was such 
an innovative, forward-thinking band 
when they emerged onto the scene in the 
mid-to-late 2000s. Years later, though, 
I wish they would fully embrace a new 
direction. 
For an album, I wasn’t a big fan of the 
lack of cohesiveness between tracks, 
but in a live setting, hearing the band 
play a variety of genres and styles was 
extremely entertaining and showcased 
just how talented this group is, even 
without their full recording roster 
of around 25 musicians. Each of the 
nine musicians on stage had a distinct 
musical voice, even beyond the fact that 
they were playing different instruments. 
Solos taken by saxophonist Chris Bullock 
tended to be more straightforward and 
melodic, while Shaun Martin often times 
took solos on his Moog synthesizer that 
integrated crazy timbral shifts and 
chaotic flurries of sounds.
As the group returned to the stage of 
Hill for an encore, the audience erupted 
into cheers as the opening chords to 
the band’s ever-popular song “Lingus” 
played, launching Shaun Martin into an 
epic five minute keyboard solo to end the 
evening. There was no better way to kick 
off the UMS season than with Snarky 
Puppy’s return to Hill Auditorium.

CONCERT REVIEW

RYAN COX
Daily Arts Writer

In the eyes of a parent, a child 
can do no real wrong. Even the 
most vile of children might be 
seen as angels through the eyes 
of a loving parent, especially 
during their tumultuous teenage 
years. Our parents are supposed 
to be our biggest cheerleaders 
and our greatest protectors, but 
the reality is that they often see 
us as they want to see us, not 
as we actually are. In a sense, 
as a part of growing up, we all 
develop two separate identities 
— the people that our parents 
know us to be and the people 
who we are. In “Luce,” director 

Julius Onah expertly explores 
the inevitable gap that develops 
between children and parents 
as adulthood looms, crafting a 
riveting, wickedly suspenseful 
film that left me unexpectedly 
shaken. 
Luce (Kelvin Harrison Jr. 
“Monsters and Men”), a high 
school senior, has a relationship 
with his parents that seems 
quite healthy, filled with family 
dinners and car-ride banter. 
Practically a beacon of light to 
everyone around him, Luce lives 
up to his name. Envied by his 
peers, placed on a pedestal by 
his teachers, and adored by his 
parents, Luce is the paradigm 
model student. Or so it seems. 
To an outsider looking in, every 
piece of Luce’s life appears to 
fit perfectly. However, after his 
stern history teacher Ms. Wilson 
(Octavia 
Spencer, 
“Hidden 
Figures”) finds a mysterious 
bag filled with incriminating 
contents, the virtuosity of Luce’s 
character steadily becomes less 
and less clear. 
What really makes this film 
work is that every single actor 
brings 
their 
A-game. 
Props 
especially must be given to 
Spencer and Harrison, who 
truly carry the entirety of the 
film and keep audiences glued 

to the screen. Spencer and 
Edgar both play characters 
with 
questionable 
integrity. 
Throughout the film, we find 
ourselves going back in forth, 
struggling to determine who 
actually has the moral high 
ground or if both are in the 
wrong. A testament to their 
stunning embodiment of Ms. 
Wilson and Luce, Spencer and 
Edgar 
have 
us 
desperately 
picking up breadcrumbs leading 
to the truth from the opening 
scene until the screen goes 
black.
Along 
with 
its 
solid 
characters, the film score and 
expert pacing add to the overall 
enchanting air of mystery. The 
film is accompanied by a melodic 
but unnerving sprinkling of 
musical accompaniments. The 
score manages effortlessly to 
enhance the film as a whole, 
without distracting from what 
is happening on screen. Perhaps 
what makes the incorporation 
of music in the film so fitting 
is the perfectly-timed flow of 
events. Though not riddled with 
fast-moving, 
intense 
action 
sequences, “Luce” does not lose 
our attention for a second. The 
tension in the film lies in the 
clashing between the internal 
complexes of the characters and 
the external interactions among 
them. Seething with passive 
aggression and fakeness, the 
relationship 
between 
Ms. 
Wilson and Luce is a ticking 
time bomb just begging to be 
set off. We can’t help but sit at 
the edge of our seats, wide-
eyed and eagerly waiting for the 
inescapable explosion. 
As 
we 
are 
teased 
along 
for nearly two hours, there 
is an anticipated promise of 
resolution, but when the lights 
come back on we hold nothing 
but a few loose ends. Though 
initially 
disappointed, 
once 
we’ve 
tossed 
our 
popcorn, 
exited the theater and started 
to untangle the knot of emotions 
that “Luce” left us with, we start 
to see the film’s non-ending as a 
testament to its quality and as 
much more of a blessing than a 
curse.

‘Luce’ unsettles

Twenty hours before the 
plane 
containing 
delegates 
representing 11 different Big Ten 
volleyball teams touched down 
on foreign soil, all the players 
met up for a brief practice in 
Chicago.
There, they spent 45 minutes 
familiarizing themselves with 
one another before flying to 
Japan 
on 
June 
14 for two weeks 
for the 2019 Big

Foreign Tour.
As night fell, 
the

They

When it comes to volleyball, 
Mark Rosen’s seen everything. 
After 27 years as a head coach, 
20 with the Wolverines, Rosen 
acquired an array of knowledge, 
not just with collegiate teams 
but national teams, too. 
Even to him, being the head 
coach for the Foreign Tour team 
was “a very unique experience.”
First slotted as an assistant 
coach on staff, Rosen was 
promoted to the top position 
after former Iowa coach Bond 
Shymansky, the orginial head 
coach of the Foreign Tour 
team, was fired due to NCAA 
violations. Assuming his new 
position, Rosen had a hunch this 
experience 
coaching 
former 
opponents 
would be a new 
challenge.
“You’re 
coaching players 
that 
you’ve 
actually coached 
against, 
so 
that’s 
a 
weird 
dynamic,” Rosen 
said.
Rosen 
has 
seen the scouting 
reports on these 
players over the seasons, but 
building a system around a 
ragtag team last minute was a 
tall task.
“Some of it was just finding 
what players do, what roles go 
well,” Rosen said on making 
adjustments 
from 
match 
to 
match. 
“I 
didn’t 
really 
go 
into it with really that much 
information about the players. 
So we were figuring out on the 

fly who handles what situations 
well, who do we want to put in 
certain positional situations.”

Natalie 
Smith 
spent 
the 
majority of her first two years 
at Michigan as a defensive 
specialist. There was no need 
for a different player to get reps 
at libero during career starter 
Jenna Lerg’s tenure. But upon 
Lerg’s 
graduation, 
the 
spot 
opened up, and Smith rose to 
the occasion.
During 
the 
spring 
season, 
the junior was 
the Wolverines’ 
primary libero, 
but even then, 
her reps were 
limited. There 
were just seven 
games 
over 
the course of 
the spring, so 
the trip to Japan to face high-
caliber teams — collegiate and 
professional — proved valuable 
for a player getting adjusted to 
a new role.
“It 
was 
a 
really 
good 
opportunity for her,” Rosen said. 
“Being a younger libero, trying 
to step in and trying to take over 
for Jenna, and that role, that’s a 
big shoe to fill. I thought it was 
a great extra opportunity for 
her, another two weeks to play 
volleyball, another opportunity 
to be in that role.”
The 
opportunity 
wasn’t 
without its challenges, though. 
There was only one libero spot 
on the Big Ten team, and Penn 
State’s Jenna Hampton eyed it 
accordingly. In the end, Smith 
earned the role and Hampton 
became the designated defensive 
specialist.
What 
stood 
out 
to 
Rosen 
was 
Smith’s 
skill as a first-
touch 
passer 
and 
— 
taking 
from 
previous 
role as defensive 
specialist — her 
defense.
“She ended up 
playing 
libero 
in pretty much 
every match,” Rosen said. “And 
(Hampton) played (defensive 
specialist) and part of that is 
because she passed consistently, 
she defended really consistently, 
and she played really well.”
***
When the team landed in 
Osaka, 
Japan, 
complications 
arose.
When the players and coaches 
arrived, they prepared for a 

full day of activity — eyeing a 
practice at Senri Kinran, a 
university in Osaka. They had 
their first matchup later that 
afternoon and a team dinner 
that evening.
But the team couldn’t practice 
due to problems with the Senri 
Kinran practice facility. 
“I think there was a shooting 
that was going on there,” Smith 
said. “So we ended up going to a 
different part of town.
Prioritizing safety, the team 
used its practice time, instead, 
to explore the city, stopping by 
temples and various parts of the 
town.
For 
Senri 
Kinran, 
losing 
practice for a day was just lost 
practice. For the Big Ten team, 
it was losing so much more — 
they only had a set number of 
practices to begin with. After 
hours on a plane, moments after 
meeting as teammates for the 
first time, that practice wasn’t 
simply business as usual. It was 
a chance to further gauge each 
player, form chemistry and just 
get into a rhythm.
For a team already struggling 
with familiarity, the lack of 
practice was a heavy blow.
And it showed the next day 
when the two teams faced off. 
The Foreign Tour team not only 
lost, but lost badly. 
“We step on a court against a 
college team who really wasn’t 
very good,” Rosen said. “And as 
I watched them play and warm 
up, they weren’t very physical, 
they weren’t really that good.”
Not really that good, but good 
enough to dominate the Foreign 
Tour team and blow it out in a 
4-0 sweep? To lose 25-16, 25-15 
to a team filled with players no 
taller than the shortest player 
on the Big Ten team’s end?
But to Rosen, the answer was 
simple.
“They were organized and 
we weren’t organized, because 
we didn’t really have a chance 
to organize the team. It was bad 
volleyball.”
Added 
Smith: 
“That 
was 
disappointing, but also I think 
that you can’t become an All-
Star amazing team, ever, in 12 
days.”
The next day, the schedule 
for the Big Ten team was wake 
up, go on a morning sightseeing 
session in Osaka, and then 
head immediately to the game 
with an hour to warm up. On a 
normal gameday at Michigan, 
the players would have three 
to five hours to get into game 
mode.
“Here,” Rosen said, “we did it 
in 20 minutes.”

Combine the time crunch 
with the lack of chemistry and 
practice, and the source of the 
frustrating result became clear. 
“It 
was 
frustrating 
for 
everybody, 
and 
the 
players 
weren’t trying to play bad,” 
Rosen said. “It was nobody’s 
fault. It’s just, you’re trying to 
organize this group without 
any time or any opportunity to 
organize it. So I thought that 
along with everybody else, it was 
really frustrating 
that first night, 
because we were 
looking on, ‘How 
is 
this 
team 
losing?’ ”
The 
team 
concluded its day 
in Osaka with the 
bruising loss and 
traveled to Kyoto 
to 
repeat 
the 
cycle, this time 
with a new city and a new team, 
but a similar result.
Despite 
another 
three-set 
loss, this one felt different to 
the team. None of the sets were 
a one-sided affair. Instead, the 
team strung together three 
tightly contested sets and saw 
the growing pains beginning to 
subside.
“I thought in the second 
night, we played another college 
team who was a little bit better,” 
Rosen said. “And we played 
better.
“... We were like, ‘Hey, if we 
had played the team we played 
last night, we probably would 
have won.’ We could see them 
progressing.”
***
A 
college 
team 
and 
a 
professional team are separated 
by a lot of things: salaries, 
endorsements, 
contracts. 
But the biggest factor in the 
matchup between the Foreign 
Tour team and Denso Airybees, 
a professional team based in 
Nishio, was practice regulation.
As 
college 
athletes, 
the 
players and coaches are limited 
to 20 practice hours weekly. 
As Rosen joked with his team, 
“Those guys are probably at 20 
hours of training by Tuesday.”
And 
with 
more 
time 
to 
practice 
and 
train, 
comes 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
play. 
Additionally, the style of play 
in Japan is completely different 
from the U.S. Whereas in the 
U.S., physicality is the name of 
the game, speed rules supreme 
in Japan. In the matchup, the 
differences in style and training 
showed.
“They practice a lot, and you 
can tell by the way they play,” 

Rosen said. “They’re not very 
physical. They don’t outphysical 
you, they outplay you.”
The end result was another 
three-game sweep, but unlike 
before, the growth of the Big 
Ten team could be seen as the 
sets progressed. 25-12, 25-18, 
25-19. The more the teams 
played, the more adjusted to the 
speed the Big Ten players got.
They were playing together 
and playing better volleyball. 
The next night, 
in front of a 
crowd of 1,500, 
the 
Big 
Ten 
team 
played 
Denso Airybees 
again. 
There, 
they made its 
breakthrough.
“They’re 
so 
fast, 
and 
their system is 
so 
intricate,” 
Rosen said. “And a lot of these 
players had never seen anything 
like that so we had to make some 
adjustments on the fly.”
Because the players in Japan 
were so much shorter, they ran 
their offense faster, forcing 
the contact to come around 
the chest area — a different 
experience for the players who 
are used to extending the length 
of their arms in hopes of tipping 
the ball with fingertips. The 
new point of contact and speed 
took time to adjust to, but with 
a proper game plan, they could 
envision the style vividly post 
match.
There was no practice time 
in between the matches, despite 
being on two different days. 
There was only a video session, 
where the team sat down and 
talked about what it had to do. 
“Just 
speed 
comes so fast, you 
can’t move very 
much,” 
Rosen 
said. “Once the 
ball is set to the 
hitter, from set to 
hit, we call that 
base to read, you 
have no time, so 
you got to kind of 
position yourself 
in a way where 
you basically just 
have to face the action. You 
can’t really move into a new 
position.”
The 
player 
that 
excelled 
in that was none other than 
Natalie Smith.
Smith provided support in 
more ways than just as a libero, 
proving instrumental to the 3-1 
win against Denso Airybees. 
She stepped up as a leader.

People who have worked with 
her say she’s an easy person to 
play with. She communicates 
well, works hard and connects 
easily. 
“She can slide into your 
team and be pretty comfortable 
pretty quickly,” Rosen said.
Once 
Smith 
acquainted 
herself with the team, she took 
the next step as a player, taking 
a leadership role. As a libero, 
she occupied a large part of the 
court. However, just as the team 
didn’t have any scouting reports 
on the opposition, the teams 
they faced didn’t have any on 
them. So it boiled down to what 
the teams saw on the court.
“They see a girl in the other 
colored 
jersey, 
and 
they’re 
going to assume she’s probably a 
pretty good passer,” Rosen said. 
“So she really didn’t get tested a 
lot, so she was helping the other 
players a lot by pushing their 
court and making sure she took 
more court, to ease them off, to 
help them.”
It 
was 
something 
Smith 
had seen time and time again. 
They avoided her in the service 
game, giving her space on the 
court. That paid its dividends 
in the rematch against Denso 
Airybees. From her ball control 
to her defense, Smith actively 
commanded the first touch and 
enabled an efficient offense.
“I thought (Smith) did a 
fantastic job of doing that 
defensively,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“Because it’s from setter to 
hitter, it’s bam bam, and they 
had to be really good at making 
adjustments, so I thought it was 
a great opportunity for her. And 
believe me, she’s not going to 
ever see anything faster than 
what we saw there.”
Picking 
up 
on 
Denso 
Airybee’s 
tendencies was 
the 
turning 
point 
of 
the 
series. 
As 
every 
point 
passed, 
every 
set 
finished, 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
packed 
house in Kyoto 
quieted little by 
little, until nothing but silence 
answered the sound of the 
Foreign Team finishing a kill.
Four sets later, 25-22, 25-23, 
25-15, 26-24, and the Big Ten 
team prevailed, securing its 
only victory of the trip.
“They’re all rooting against 
you, and then you beat them so 
easily,” Smith said. “It’s just so 
silent and serene.”

Rosen and Smith: New country, new roles, the road to a win

EVAN AARON/Daily
Michigan coach Mark Rosen was tabbed to coach a group of Big Ten All Stars last summer that also included Michigan’s Natalie Smith on the Big Ten Volleyball Foreign Tour in Japan, where the team went 1-3 against the country’s best teams.

A CONVERSATION WITH 
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE 
JUSTIN AMASH

Glasgow making impact at WILL

Don Brown knows you’ll think 
he’s crazy, but he doesn’t much 
care.
After all, he’s been around 
the block a time or two. In over 
40 years in the profession, he’s 
coached 
All-Americans 
and 
future professionals. He’s spent 
his life living and breathing 
defensive football — and he’s one 
of the best around.
That gives him the license to 
make a determination that strays 
from conventional wisdom a 
time or two. On Monday, that 
particular claim came in regard 
to 
senior 
linebacker 
Jordan 
Glasgow.
“I’ll say this, and I might be 
criticized: This guy might be one 
of the best players in the Big Ten,” 
Brown said. “Watch him run and 
hit people. Just watch him play.”
Coming 
into 
the 
season, 
the 
fifth-year 
senior was seen 
as 
valuable 
versatility — a 
depth piece to 
shore 
up 
the 
linebacking 
corps. He wasn’t 
the 
starter 
at 
VIPER, the spot 
belonging 
to 
senior 
Khaleke 
Hudson. 
He 
wasn’t the heir apparent to Devin 
Bush at the MIKE linebacker 
spot, either. That position, the 
general consensus held, was 
going to be Josh Ross’. He wasn’t 
slated to be the WILL linebacker 
either, but he won that job 
anyway.
And in a personnel group 
defined in the early season by 
volatility, Glasgow remains a 
steadying presence. In the early 
weeks of the season, he’s taken 
that play up a notch.
In a week one win over Middle 
Tennessee 
State, 
Glasgow 
secured two sacks, matching 
his career total to that point. 
Against Army the next week, he 

seamlessly slotted into one of the 
inside linebacker spots, helping 
hold the Black Knights to their 
lowest yards-per-rush average 
since 2015 and their lowest total 
yardage since 2017.
Asked to dissect why Glasgow 
was accepting of a move inside, 
from his more 
natural 
VIPER 
spot, 
Brown 
initially scoffed.
“Are 
you 
serious? He had 
no choice, ‘You’re 
moving 
inside,’ 
” Brown joked. 
“(Glasgow) 
was 
willing (to make 
the move). He’s a 
great dude.”
Glasgow came to Michigan 
a walk-on — and brother of 
Graham, who then manned the 
Wolverines’ offensive line and 
now plays for the Detroit Lions. 
His career at Michigan has 
been a coach’s dream — steady 
ascension, gradual increase in 
role, sudden blossom, invaluable 
veteran contributor. In many 
ways, though, he still carries the 
stereotypes that hang around his 
path. Asked after his standout 
opening-week 
performance 
about newfound speed, Glasgow 
instead shrugs it off.
“It’s difficult to say. I don’t 
consider myself very fast relative 
to the other people on the team, 

people that are my size,” Glasgow 
said. “I think that you may be 
exaggerating how fast I am.”
Turn 
to 
Brown, 
though, 
and he’ll entertain no such 
degradation.
“I mean, he’s a junkie,” Brown 
said. “He might be one of the 
funnest guys in the world to 
coach, because he loves it. He eats 
it. He drinks it and he backs it up, 
because he smashes everybody 
that moves.”
Brown then offered a quick 
anecdote to illustrate that point, 
recalling a phone call he received 
one night.
Coach, 
I’ll 
be 
available 
tomorrow morning at 7:20. I’d like 
to go over my plays.
OK, I’ll see you tomorrow to go 
over your plays.
I specifically want to go over my 
(naked bootlegs). 
OK, we’ll go over the (naked 
bootlegs).
If anything, Glasgow’s path 
lends more credence to his merit, 
not less. He is no longer a walk-
on. He is no longer just Graham’s 
brother. He’s shed nearly every 
hindrance in his path, and he’s 
done so on his own terms. Two 
weeks into his final collegiate 
season, Glasgow is a steadying 
force for a group once seen as a 
possible liability. 
And 
if 
Don 
Brown 
has 
anything to say about it, one of 
the best players in the Big Ten.

OL looking to clean up penalties

As Cesar Ruiz assessed the 
state of Michigan’s offensive line 
earlier this week, he was careful 
not to label any struggles as 
“growing pains.”
The implication accompanying 
that term is that the Wolverines’ 
inconsistency on the offensive 
line is a result of Josh Gattis’ new 
offense. The junior center knows 
that isn’t the case.
“We 
all 
understand 
the 
offense, 
we 
all 
understand 
everything,” Ruiz said. “It’s just, 
once you get in the game, you’ve 
got to understand everything’s 
fast-paced and there’s no re-dos.”
But 
the 
truth 
remains 
inescapable. 
Two 
weeks 
into 
Michigan’s 
season, 
the 
Wolverines’ offense hasn’t lived 
up to expectations.
So what gives?
“When you look at it over the 
past few games, we’ve got seven 
turnovers, we have 10 penalties, 
but then we also have seven 
drops,” Gattis said. “So you go 
back and look at all those plays in 
critical situations, they’re killers.”
Turnovers have led to every 
regulation touchdown given up by 

the first-team defense and drops 
have held the offense to nine self-
described “explosive” plays so 
far. But as Michigan’s offensive 
linemen spoke this week, it 
became clear that penalties are 
at the crux of the Wolverines’ bye 
week focuses.
At first glance, 58 penalty yards 
doesn’t seem comparable to three 
turnovers on the list of reasons 
that Michigan went to overtime 
in a game it entered as a 23-point 
favorite. But when four of those 
penalties came in a seven-point 
first half on an offensive line 
returning three starters, it’s cause 
for alarm.
“We had some penalties that 
shouldn’t happen,” said senior 
guard Ben Bredeson. “Procedure 
penalties that we’re better than 
that, we know better than that. 
And obviously just (frustrated) 
with myself for that one. But it’s 
just focus time and something 
that we need to correct going 
forward.”
So 
as 
Ruiz 
watched 
his 
offensive line struggle against a 
defensive line with no player over 
300 pounds, he had a message for 
the unit.
“My thing was, we can’t lose,” 
Ruiz said. “We can’t lose to this 

team. We can’t keep shooting 
ourselves in the foot. That was my 
main message. We had a few false 
start penalties — I had one. ... You 
don’t get too many chances with 
the football against this team 
so we’ve got to maximize every 
opportunity we have.”
Against 
Wisconsin 
next 
Saturday, the Wolverines will be 
confronted with one of the Big 
Ten’s premier defensive units, 
further limiting their margin for 
error. It’s why Bredeson called 
the bye week “not the worst 
(timing) in the world.” Now, the 
challenge is taking advantage of 
these two weeks.
While eliminating unfocused 
penalties will be a point of 
emphasis during the bye week, 
Michigan will also be focusing 
on spotting blitzes and picking 
up assignments — two things the 
Wolverines practice every day, 
according to Ruiz.
Now, the challenge is turning 
them into live reps.
“Every game’s not going to be 
perfect,” Ruiz said. “But it’s up to 
us to minimize every single one 
of those mistakes. It’s great we 
have a bye week to focus on a lot 
of those things and to be extra 
focused on those.”

Back at Yost Ice Arena, Winnipeg’s Kyle Connor makes his presence felt

A sea of players took to the 
rink in Yost Ice Arena.
Some 
wore 
blue 
practice 
jerseys, others white. One even 
wore purple — a signal for 
exemption from physical contact. 
But the one thing all the players 
of the Michigan hockey team 
shared was the navy helmet they 
wore, crowning them a member 
of the Wolverines.
But as practice began this 
week, and even before that, a 
different colored helmet could 
be spotted — a player donning a 
white helmet in a white jersey 
— shooting pucks hours after 
practice had concluded and all 
the players had trickled off the 
ice to the locker room.
It was Kyle Connor.
The former Michigan forward 
recorded 
35 
goals 
and 
36 
assists in his lone year with the 
Wolverines, placing runner-up 

for the Hobey Baker Award in 
2015-16. Connor got drafted into 
the National Hockey League 
with the Winnipeg Jets where he 
continued his success, recording 
two 
back-to-back, 
30-goal 
seasons.
And lately, Connor’s presence, 
as an elite player and friend, has 
been felt at Yost.
“Kyle’s been around,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“He’s been around the last few 
summers since he’s turned pro. 
He always comes back to Ann 
Arbor. He enjoys it here.”
Swinging by, summer after 
summer. A standstill in contract 
talks has extended his annual 
summer visit into September 
this year. When he comes to Yost, 
Connor arrives with a wealth of 
knowledge and experience. With 
three years as a professional, on 
top of a storied college career, 
Connor has insights on what 
it takes to be successful at all 
levels.

“As a coach, I want to ask him 
questions,” Pearson said. “Just 
about little things, whether it’s 
about analytics at the next level 
or practice at the next level, or 
how hard they work or what 
it might be. Or 
different drills. 
You’re 
always 
trying to steal 
ideas and steal 
thoughts 
and 
whatnot.”
Connor’s time 
at 
Michigan 
didn’t 
overlap 
with 
Pearson, 
who 
was 
the 
then-head coach 
of Michigan Tech before taking 
over for Red Berenson before 
the 2017-18 season. But the lack 
of familiarity didn’t stop the two 
from conversing and learning 
more about each other’s path to 
success. And it wasn’t a one-way 
affair.
“As a young kid coming in,” 

Connor told The Daily, “you just 
want to pick his brain and talk, 
kind of similar to Red.”
The trading of information 
wasn’t limited to just coach and 
pro, though. Pearson thought his 
players would be 
“well-served” 
to ask for a few 
pointers 
from 
“one of the best 
at what he does.” 
But the players 
didn’t 
need 
the push from 
Pearson to act — 
they had already 
approached 
the 
NHL 
star 
themselves.
Though Connor was gone 
by the time the current seniors 
stepped foot on campus as 
freshmen, they had seen him 
plenty, whether for summer skate 
or a drop-by during practice.
“I’ve talked to a lot of the guys, 
just kind of the upperclassmen,” 

Connor said. “I know them a 
little bit, just being familiar and 
talking to them. They’re a great 
group of guys. And they work 
hard. I mean, that’s the biggest 
thing.”
His 
pointers 
to the seniors, 
including 
forwards 
Will 
Lockwood 
and 
Jake 
Slaker, 
were 
centered 
around Connor’s 
specialties: 
shooting 
and 
passing.
“We were out 
there 
doing 
a 
shooting drill, and he was talking 
about what it takes to score at the 
next level,” Lockwood said. “And 
just some things to work on, 
which obviously, coming from 
him, is a pretty big deal — he 
scores 30 goals a year.”
Puck 
release, 
speed 
of 
shot, shooting on net. Connor 

emphasized the importance of 
getting the puck off quickly, 
regardless of the power behind 
the stroke. 
“You just got to hit the net and 
get it off quickly, especially when 
the puck’s going 
from side to side, 
Lockwood said. 
“So some good 
advice 
from 
him.” 
But 
just 
as 
important 
as 
Connor’s 
words 
are his everyday 
actions at Yost. 
As he practices, 
skating 
or 
shooting, eyes wander in his 
direction, looking to him to lead 
by example.
“It’s not even him talking. Just 
kind of watching him you know, 
of course as an elite player in 
the NHL,” Slaker said. “So just 
watching him you just learn. It’s 
fun having him there.”
