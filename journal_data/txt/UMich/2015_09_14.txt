CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED-TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Michigan picked up its first win 

of the Harbaugh era on Saturday

» INSIDE

One Down

Attendees 

disappointed by 

session’s tone, lack 
of concrete solutions

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Top University administra-

tors addressed Greek life culture 
Thursday during their first all-
chapter meeting in the 170 years 
of University Greek life — and 
some Greek life members weren’t 
pleased with what how it went 
down.

Citing examples alcohol abuse, 

destruction of property and sex-
ual assault rate within the com-
munity, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel told the members 
their behavior reflects negatively 
on the University and ultimately 
devalues all students’ and alum-
ni’s education.

A few members of the audience 

strategically 
coughed 
during 

several parts of his and others’ 
speeches — to such an extent that 
E. Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, commented on 
it at the beginning of her speech 
and IFC President Alex Krupiak, 
an LSA senior, said their response 
was further hurting the reputa-
tion the administration was try-
ing to mend through the meeting.

“Think for a second about how 

much your chapter means to you,” 
Krupiak said. “I know it means 
a hell of a lot to me … But when 
students sit here and blatantly 
disrespect the leaders of our Uni-
versity and fellow students like 
myself and the three behind me, 
it’s flat-out embarrassing to say 
I’m a member of Greek life today.”

The Michigan Daily spoke 

with dozens of members of 
Greek life from several chapters 
to gauge community reaction 
to Thursday’s event. Because 
most members were barred from 
speaking to the press by chapter 
leadership, some members who 
spoke to the Daily were granted

Officials also 

consider increased 

monitoring of 

‘rogue’ fraternities 

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

A day after 
Thursday’s meet-

ing 
 with all chapters of Universi-

ty Greek life, E. Royster Harper, 

vice president for student life, 
elaborated on potential forth-
coming policies to better moni-
tor the Greek community.

These could include delaying 

Greek rush and paying greater 
attention to “rogue houses,” or 
disbanded former Greek organi-
zations that continue to assemble 
off campus.

Harper said the event was 

meant to voice genuine concern 
for students’ health and well-
ness, not punitively admonish 

them.

Subsequently, she expressed 

surprise and disappointment in 
how both students and adminis-
trators handled the meeting.

“I think what I ended up feel-

ing was… Let your behavior 
reflect your values in this setting, 
as opposed to sort of reinforcing 
the stereotypical perception,” 
she said. “Together, we can turn 
this. This party can’t continue 
this way, and we all know it. But 
we could decide, together, to do 

something different about it.”

This collaborative goal for 

improvement, Harper said, is 
representative of the fact that 
students are as much a part of 
affecting campus policy as are 
administrators — and it takes the 
entire village to catalyze culture 
shift.

Harper was quick to acknowl-

edge that partying can be a part 
of students’ college experience. 
And it’s not partying, explicitly,

Settlement to 

reverse decision in 
2012 case, pending 

court approval

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The University dropped a sex-

ual misconduct ruling against 
former student Drew Sterrett 
in accordance with a lawsuit 
settlement the University signed 
on Sept. 1. The agreement was 
signed by Sterrett on Sept. 8.

Per the settlement, the Uni-

versity will reverse its previous 
findings, which found Sterrett in 
violation of the school’s Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy. The 
University also cannot investi-
gate the case further. In return, 
Sterrett agreed to not return to 
the University or to disparage 
the University. The settlement is 
pending approval from a federal 
judge.

Sterrett was suspended from 

the University in Fall 2012 after 
the school found Sterrett in vio-

lation of the University’s sexual 
misconduct code by engaging 
in non-consensual sex with a 
female friend in his dorm room. 
Sterrett was given the option to 
return to the University on the 
condition he admitted to com-
mitting the sexual assault.

In response, Sterrett filed 

a lawsuit against the Univer-
sity. Deborah Gordon, Sterrett’s 
attorney, said the University’s 
handling of the case was a depri-
vation of constitutional due pro-
cess rights.

According to Sterrett’s law-

suit claim, he and the female 
friend who later filed the com-
plaint were “socializing” and 
had sexual relations in his dorm 
room, where she proceeded to 
stay overnight. She filed the 
complaint with the University 
five months after the incident, 
but did not contact the police.

Sterrett further claims in his 

suit that the University told him 
if he delayed his interview with 
the University to consult a law-
yer, the investigation would go 
on without him. Gordon claims 
this was an infringement of her

Michigan football players celebrate their 35-7 win against Oregon State by jumping into the student section at the Big 
House on Saturday.

Smith, defense help 
Wolverines win in 
Harbaugh’s home 
coaching debut

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh did not touch 

the “Go Blue” banner when he 
ran onto the field at Michigan 

Stadium for the first time as the 
Michigan football team’s head 
coach. He sprinted underneath 
it, his focus directed toward the 
sidelines.

He had insisted all week that 

his attention was only on the 
game itself, not the nostalgia 
of returning to the school he 
quarterbacked in college. The 
improvements his team needed 
to make after its season-opening 
loss were evident and plentiful. 
The run game had struggled, 

turnovers had been troubling 
and the defense had experienced 
lapses. There was little time to 
consider how it would feel when 
more than 100,000 fans, his own 
fans, would scream his name.

After his team defeated Oregon 

State on Saturday, 35-7, Harbaugh 
did not change his tone regarding 
the emotional side of his home 
debut and first victory as Michi-
gan’s coach. He considered him-
self nothing more than a member

Findings could 

result in improved 
drug treatments

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Depression 
has 
long 
been 

associated with a lack of certain 
chemicals in the brain. However, 
new University research suggests 
depression may involve too much 
of one specific protein.

Elyse Aurbach, a neuroscience 

graduate student, and Edny Inui, 
who earned her PhD at the Uni-
versity, found FGF9 levels were 
markedly increased in the brains 
of depressed individuals.

Aurbach and Inui looked at 

post-mortem brain tissue in peo-
ple who had had depression and 
in people who did not, and discov-
ered different levels of a protein 
called fibroblast growth factor 
9. Aurbach said this method had 
its limitations — it was not pos-
sible to determine if high levels of 
FGF9 caused depression or were 
an effect of depression.

 20 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (SEPTEMBER 14, 1995)
‘U’ reinstates ombudsman 

STACK THAT

On this day in 1995, 

the University reinstated 
the 
ombudsman 
posi-

tion, whose role was to 
act as a liaison or media-
tor between students and 
the University if problems 
arise between the two 
parties.

Richard Carter, an asso-

ciate dean of students, 
was appointed as the sec-
ond interim ombudsman.

E. Royster Harper, then 

dean of students and the 
current vice president for 
student life, said Cart-
er would be “terrific in 
terms of advocacy to and 
for students.” Harper said 
the office would also give 

exit interviews to stu-
dents who are thinking 
of leaving the University. 
The goal was to help them 
leave the University in 
good standing and be able 
to transfer to other uni-
versities with ease.

Maureen 
Hartford, 

vice president for student 
affairs at the time, said 
the changes in the office 
were mainly to help with 
student 
outreach 
and 

create a place to go for 
students having disagree-
ments with the University. 
She said most students did 
not know about the office, 
and it provides a way for 
them to seek assistance.

At the time, Harper said 

there would eventually be 
a permanent position for 
ombudsman, but it would 
first go through a transi-
tion period reaching out 
to students as a neutral 
party.

The 
Office 
of 
the 

Ombuds still exists on 
campus and according to 
their website, is a “place 
where student questions, 
complaints and concerns 
about the functioning of 
the University can be dis-
cussed confidentially in a 
safe environment.”

Sixth annnual 

hackathon 

includes three 
new initiatives

BY TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Now in its sixth itera-

tion, MHacks welcomed 
roughly 1,500 participants 
and community members 
to its North Campus hack-
athon, where participants 
from around the country 
toiled for 36 hours to learn 
from 
industry 
profes-

sionals and design both 
hardware and software 
products.

MHacks 
6 
marked 

the first year of MHacks 
as its own entity. It was 
previously a branch of 
MPowered Entrepreneur-
ship, a club on campus 

that 
promotes 
student 

involvement in technol-
ogy, entrepreneurship and 
startups in the Ann Arbor 
area.

Existing as a solitary 

organization was one of 
the challenges in organiz-
ing this year’s MHacks, 
according to LSA sopho-
more Connor Johnston, 
one of the event’s co-
directors. 
This 
year’s 

conference also marked a 
return to what the web-
site calls its core focus: 
providing an environment 
where every hacker has 
the opportunity to grow, 
“no matter the skill level.”

LSA 
junior 
Pavithra 

Vetriselvan, the other co-
director, said three new 
initiatives were created 
to foster an environment 
conducive to growth: an 
introductory 
workshop 

about the world of hack-
athons, a mini-conference 

targeting female partici-
pants 
called 
Women@

MHacks 
and 
a 
social 

impact project.

“There’s 
so 
much 

potential when you bring 
so many talented coders to 
the University, and having 
them use their abilities to 
actually make an impact 
is something that I want 
to try to do this semes-
ter,” Vetriselvan said. “So 
we have mentors com-
ing in from the School of 
Public Health, School of 
Education 
and 
Detroit 

just to make sure people 
have a good idea of what 
the space and the prob-
lems are in order to see 
how they can better serve 
those problems through 
technology.’’

LSA 
sophomore 
and 

MHacks volunteer Shayna 
Mehta worked with Vetri-
selvan and LSA junior 
Preeti Mohan to develop 

the 
Women@

MHacks 
event, 

which 
Mehta 

said was meant 
to address the 
overwhelming 
lack of female 
representation in 
STEM fields.

“Hackathons 

in general — and 
it’s sort of exten-
sion to the tech 
community 
in 

general – have 
a 
really 
seri-

ous gender gap,” 
Mehta said. “You 
know there’s a 
problem 
when 

schools and com-
panies are happy 
with an 18-per-
cent 
female 

representation 
in 
technology 

industries.”

University alum 

Thomas Miller says 
politics influence 

efficacy of diplomats

BY ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Former ambassador Thomas Miller, 

a University alum, discussed challeng-
es with navigating the line between 
diplomacy and development at a talk 
hosted by the School of Public Policy 
on Thursday.

Miller is the president and CEO 

of International Executive Service 
Corps, an international nonprofit that 
helps developing nations build busi-
nesses. He said it is crucial for profes-
sionals to understand the difference 
between diplomacy and development.

According to Miller, diplomats 

focus on working with leaders of the 
country to negotiate relations with 
the United States. On the other hand, 
development 
professionals 
serve 

those in need, such as people in war-
torn countries. 

“Without understanding the differ-

ences through which diplomats and 
development professionals approach 
their job, it’s just too easy to launch 
into criticism of either without genu-
inely appreciating their fundamental-
ly different perspectives,” Miller said.

Prior to his tenure at IECS, Miller 

was a seasoned diplomat in numer-
ous European and Asian countries, 
working on issues such as terrorism 
and recovery from war. He served as 
ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovi-
na from 1999 to 2001 and ambassador 
to Greece from 2001 to 2004.

University alum Ron Weiser, a 

former U.S. ambassador to Slovakia 
who ran for the University’s Board of 
Regents last year, introduced Miller 
by pointing to his focus on strength-
ening national security following the 
9/11 attacks. 

Weiser noted Miller’s efforts while 

he was ambassador to Greece to tight-
en security for the 2004 Greek Olym-
pics. 

“Those Olympics were pulled off 

… with incredible security and the 
American government supplied a 
great deal of that security,” Weiser 
said. “Tom did an incredible job.”

Miller said politics often influence 

the efficacy of diplomats. For example, 
many diplomats or foreign agents of a 
new political party’s administration 
feel pressured to make changes to 
existing practices, no matter how ben-
eficial they were, simply because they 
were from the opposing party.

“I have seen too many cases where 

good ideas or practices were desert-
ed by a new administration simply 
because they came from their prede-
cessor,” he said.

Discussing his current work, Miller 

said private nonprofits can make sig-
nificant changes in developing coun-
tries. He noted the work IESC does 
with Afghans to help build small busi-
ness for their economy. He said what 
makes IESC successful is their sen-
sitivity to Afghani norms, as well as 
employing a vast amount of Afghani 
nationals in their offices.

However, he said a problem he runs 

into is attempting to prove or demon-
strate the progress he is making in a 
short time span, when bringing sig-
nificant change to a country can take 
years.

Former ambassador discusses 
diplomacy, development at Ford


anonymity for this piece.

Many agreed with Krupiak’s 

statement and did not support the 
disrespect of the few who were 
disrupting the speeches with 
their outbursts of coughing orga-
nized over Yik Yak. One member 
of Greek life told the Daily Kru-
piak’s assertion at the end of the 
event resonated with her.

“The immaturity and rude-

ness that Greek life members 
showed throughout the entire 
meeting was appalling,” one 
member said. “People were 
laughing and cheering when the 
University officials were listing 
terrible cases of alcohol abuse, 
vandalism and other behavior 
that is really a problem in the 
community. Many people did 
not give the speakers enough 
respect even to sit through the 
entire meeting. I left the meet-
ing with little hope that Greek 
life will change.”

LSA junior Nicolette Taber, 

a member of Alpha Delta Pi, 
agreed.

“I thought it was extremely 

disappointing to see my fellow 
Greek students disrespect our 
school’s leadership,” Taber said. 
“While Schlissel was address-
ing our community’s alcohol 
and sexual assault issues, many 
people in the crowd coughed 
and laughed. I am proud to be in 
Greek life, but I was taken aback 
by the utter lack of respect for 
our school’s leaders.”

Still, many of those inter-

viewed said the meeting was 
handled poorly, noting in par-
ticular that the the administra-
tion offered more criticism than 
solutions or proposals.

Several students said the dis-

ruptions during the meeting 
represented only a minority of 
the Greek life community and 
did not feel it was fair for all of 
Greek life to be blamed for the 
actions of few.

Alpha Sigma Phi president 

Tom Allen, a Public Policy 
junior, said he believes Greek life 
is open to change overall.

“I think as a whole probably 

95 percent of people there were 
respectful and open and wel-
coming to the message that was 
being given,” Allen said. “Maybe 
there are a few people there who 
didn’t feel that way because 
they were forced to be there, but 
those people aren’t the ones that 
are going to be making decisions 
for fraternities and sororities 
and Greek life as a whole. (Greek 
life) is definitely going to be open 
to what was said yesterday and 
in the future work really close 
with the University to make 
things safer.”

The University’s decision to 

levy penalties on chapters who 
failed to meet the 70 percent 
attendance 
requirement 
also 

rubbed several members the 
wrong way.

“We do respect the leader-

ship, but we don’t believe in 
forced respect,” a fraternity 
member said. “We were forced 
under fiscal and social penalty 
to attend, we were forced to be 
lectured at, and that’s why there 
was not a more positive show-
ing. You can’t force people to do 
things against their will and get 
a positive reaction and spark a 
strong discussion.”

While many of the members 

interviewed agreed with those 
sentiments, others said there 
was no other way to have this 
type of discussion and reach a 
mass audience.

One person said she agreed 

with the points raised, but felt 
unfairly targeted. Others said 
the event was redundant and the 
message was lost in the process.

“I thought the meeting’s 

effect was killed by its length,” 
one sorority member said. “No 
one wanted to be there in the 
first place, and the sheer number 
of speakers did not help change 
anyone’s mind. After listening 
to the disrespectful responses of 
the crowd during the meeting, I 
don’t think it will affect change. 
They didn’t announce any policy 
changes, it was more of an hour-
and-a-half long warning.”

Most said the issues raised by 

University administrators were 
broad problems and applied to 

student communities other than 
Greek life.

“That was the one big thing 

that people were against is that 
it was spoken as just the Greek 
community,” he said. “If any-
thing, a lot of the times when 
incidents happen it’s people 
from outside of the organiza-
tion that come to our parties and 
cause trouble. So, it’s a message 
that really should have been 
transmitted to the entire Uni-
versity.”

Many members who spoke 

with the Daily said Greek life 
actually does a better job than 
other organizations at ensuring 
parties are safe. Unlike students 
hosting house parties or ath-
letic teams hosting team parties, 
Greek life parties are heavily 
regulated.

“We have sober monitors, 

attendance lists, strict alcohol 
rules 
and 
risk-management 

policies. Removing Greek life 
wouldn’t remove parties, it 
would remove safe parties,” one 
member said.

Several members said they 

did not see an actual plan that 
would be implemented and felt 
the University was just telling 
them things they already knew.

But that doesn’t mean they 

disagreed with the points given.

Several members said they 

identified with the problems 
outlined — one even agreed 
with Schlissel’s statement on the 
party culture devaluing the Uni-
versity.

Members said they’re just not 

sure what should be done about 
it.“They did address Greek cul-
ture, partying and drinking, but 
that’s also a nationwide prob-
lem which is something we can 
help but it’s not just us,” another 
member said. “They were talk-
ing about I’m Shmacked videos 
a lot and how they think it’s 
attracting the wrong crowd, but 
at the same time the people in 
admissions are the ones mak-
ing the decisions. Just because 
you want to go to a party school, 
you still have to have the grades 
to get in. The people that want 
to come here don’t just want the 
party scene.”

of the University community.

“We enjoy that,” Harbaugh said. 

“You’re a very small part.”

But Harbaugh’s return brought 

more than a small dose of excite-
ment to the Big House. It brought 
fans who came early and stayed 
late, and students who remained 
standing at their seats well into the 
second half, even in what became 
a blowout.

It 
also 
brought 
something 

rarely seen from Michigan in 
recent years: smashmouth foot-
ball. Junior running back De’Veon 
Smith bulldozed his way to 126 
yards and three touchdowns. He 
ran through tacklers, and he ran 
around tacklers. The first phrase 
Smith uttered in his postgame 
press conference was telling.

“Shout-out to the offensive 

line,” he said.

The unit has been criticized 

and picked apart in recent years, 
known more for allowing hits 

to the quarterback than making 
holes for running backs. That was 
not the case Saturday. The offen-
sive line’s play improved as the 
game wore on. Michigan rushed 
for 215 yards after the first quar-
ter, while the Beavers ran for 
minus-28 in that time.

Oregon State was able to hide 

its offensive ineptitude early on. 
The Beavers picked apart the 
Wolverine defense on a seven-
play, 79-yard touchdown drive on 
their first possession of the game. 
Oregon State then forced a fumble 
when the Michigan offense took 
over, regaining possession on the 
Wolverines’ 24-yard line.

The opportunity to take a 14-0 

lead was short-lived. Michigan 
junior defensive end Taco Charl-
ton stripped Oregon State running 
back Victor Bolden of the ball, 
and Michigan senior linebacker 
Joe Bolden snatched it out of the 
air and returned it 17 yards. With 
that, the Beavers’ opportunity for 
offensive productivity had ended.

The Wolverines’ offensive pro-

duction did not begin in earnest 
until 7:01 remained in the first half. 

Michigan orchestrated a 69-yard 
touchdown drive that featured a 
heavy dose of Smith. He ran for 
22 yards on the drive, added 20 
more on a 4th-and-5 reception and 
capped it with a touchdown.

Smith’s second touchdown of 

the game was the result of what 
Harbaugh called a fortuitous play 
with 1:12 left in the first half. Ore-
gon State punter Nick Porebski 
settled back to punt, and booted 
the ball out of bounds on Michi-
gan’s two-yard line. However, a 
penalty called the kick back.

The ensuing attempt resulted 

in disaster for the Beavers. The 
snap sailed over Porebski’s head, 
and the Wolverines took over on 
Oregon State’s three-yard line.

“That happens once a half-a-

century for your team,” Harbaugh 
deadpanned.

Smith punched the ball into the 

end zone three plays later. Min-
utes earlier, Harbaugh had been 
furious at a roughing the punter 
call on Michigan, throwing his 
play sheet in disgust while relent-
lessly chirping at the referees. 
The stadium roared in agreement, 

basking in Harbaugh’s emotion, 
but his prior dissatisfaction mat-
tered little after the Wolverines 
scored.

Michigan never relinquished 

the momentum as Oregon State 
reeled. The second half was simi-
lar to the end of the first. Smith 
finished the game with 23 carries, 
nine more than junior running 
backs Derrick Green and Ty Isaac 
combined. Smith and Green each 
added touchdowns to the Wol-
verines’ lead, and the size of their 
running holes only increased.

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock, charged primar-
ily with managing the game 
while Smith did the heavy lift-
ing, finished 18-for-26 on passing 
attempts for 180 yards. He threw 
one interception, well after the 
result had been decided.

In the game’s final moments, 

Harbaugh walked straight to the 
center of the field to shake Ore-
gon State coach Gary Andersen’s 
hand. If he was excited for his first 
win as Michigan’s head coach, he 
didn’t show it. He celebrated little 
on the field.

El Niño could 
bring end to harsh 
winters

Weather 
forecasters 
are 

predicting a more mild winter, 
with less precipitation, this year 
in Michigan, the Detroit Free 
Press reported. This change will 
be due to a natural warming of 
the surface waters in certain 
regions in the Pacific Ocean, a 
phenomenon called El Niño.

Tom 
Di 
Liberto, 
a 

meteorologist with the National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 

Administration, said there is a 
95-percent chance El Niño will 
last through the winter.

A warmer, drier winter could 
 

limit the flooding Michigan has 
seen in recent springs, as well as 
mean fewer logistical problems 
for the shipping industry. 

38-year-old rushes 
frat at University

Alex 
Stone, 
a 
38-year-

old fellow in a program for 
mid-career journalists at the 
University, decided to check out 
the fraternity scene on campus, 
as he wrote in a The New York 
Times piece. Stone wanted to 
see what all the recent hype 
surrounding 
Greek 
life 
was 

about.

Stone 
reported 
fraternity 

brothers 
were 
frequently 

skeptical 
of 
his 
age, 
but 

ultimately he bonded with the 
members of Alpha Delta Phi. 
That is, until he partied too hard, 
and they learned he was indeed 
38.

In the tell-all piece, Stone said 

he ended up joining the Acacia 
Fraternity — a group of men he 
had first judged as “desperate.” 
He learned he had much in 
common 
with 
the 
Acacia 

brothers, and spent his year at 
the University with them, until 
returning to life in New York.

that she has a problem with. It’s the 
excess. 

“All we’re trying to say is, ‘Look, 

we’re putting up some guard rails,’ 
” she said. “ ‘We want you to have 
as much fun as you want within the 
bounds of this guard rail … there 
are boundaries. We need to agree 
on what they are and stay within 
them.’ ”

In this vein, the University 

recently unveiled a new policy to 
call the parents of students who 
have broken the school’s alcohol 
guidelines more than once, or 
those of students who have gone to 

the hospital for overconsumption 
of alcohol or drugs.

The University is also offering 

its Change it Up program — which 
promotes bystander intervention 
and inclusive language — to stu-
dent cohorts in individual schools, 
as opposed to solely freshmen stu-
dents living in the dorms.

However, following on the heels 

of a University survey that indi-
cated a higher prevalence of sexual 
assault in the Greek life commu-
nity — and other data showing the 
strong link between sexual assault 
and alcohol — University officials 
say there is more work to be done.

One measure being considered, 

Harper said, is delaying rush.

“Does it make sense to have 

students come, and in a week, by 
the whole pledging process, we 
have thrown them into a whole 
environment that we’re worried 
about?” Harper asked. “Should we 
stay on this path we have, where 
we’ve been so committed to self-
governance, that we allow rush 
to happen sometimes less than a 
week after students get here? So 
we’re certainly going to take a look 
at that.”

Another measure, she said, will 

involve putting rogue Greek hous-
es under greater scrutiny.

Harper said she understands 

some students may perceive these 
new policies to be punitive.

“That’s not what you do with 

people you respect,” she noted, 

adding that she is a supporter of 
all the good the Greek life com-
munity contributes. “I think what 
we were trying to do (Thursday) 
night is have an authentic conver-
sation.

“I think that was a little bit 

of what we were trying to say 
(Thursday): We can’t collude 
with you to be unsafe,” Harper 
said. “So I think what we’re likely 
to see is, many more strategies 
that are designed to say, there 
are boundaries, and yeah, you’re 
going to live within them. And if 
that’s not possible, perhaps we 
need to rethink who’s coming to 
Michigan. Because we are not 
going to become the party school 
… that’s not this place.”

“The problem with looking 

at post-mortem human brains 
is that we could not tell the 
difference between something 
that 
predisposes 
someone 

toward getting depression ver-
sus a result of a person having 
had depression for years,” Aur-
bach said.

To 
address 
this 
limita-

tion, researchers did further 
experiments with live rats. 
They observed three key find-
ings. When rats were exposed 
to social stress, they showed 
increased levels of FGF9 in the 
hippocampus, the part of the 
brain associated with emotion 
and memory. If injected with 
FGF9, rats displayed increased 
anxiety — a common symptom 
of depression.

The third key finding: After 

using a virus to interfere with 
FGF9 production, the rats’ 
anxiety decreased.

These experiments showed 

increased FGF9 is not only a 
result of depression, but can 
actually cause depression in 
rats. As a result, Aurbach said 
this discovery has far-reaching 
implications.

“This study reinforces the 

idea that depression is a physi-
cal illness of the brain,” she 
said. “It is not a problem of 
willpower or of people being 
able to snap their fingers and 
adopt a different coping strat-
egy.”

Inui, co-author of the study, 

said the findings of the paper 
offer potential for design-
ing novel therapeutics. The 
results are especially promis-
ing because it is safer to design 
drugs that block the actions of 
something harmful rather than 
those that increase the actions 
of something beneficial.

“It is a lot easier from a 

drug perspective to knock 
that expression down than it 
is to increase the expression of 
another target,” she said. “That 
can potentially have many 
more side effects.”

Central to this study is its 

connection to the lives of col-
lege students, Aurbach said. 
Faced with the task of suc-
ceeding academically while 
maintaining social and extra-
curricular 
commitments, 

college students experience 
numerous stressors that can 
lead to a wide variety of mental 
health issues.

LSA senior Anna Chen is 

the president of the Univer-
sity’s chapter of Active Minds 
at the University of Michigan. 
This nonprofit organization is 
dedicated to raising awareness 
for mental health issues among 
college students.

Chen said she is very excited 

for the therapeutic potential of 
the study. Even so, she recog-
nizes there is no “quick fix” for 
mental illness.

“The causes of any mental 

illness are multifaceted,” Chen 
said. “I hope that the increas-
ing effectiveness of medica-
tions doesn’t cause people to 
devalue the benefit of supple-
menting psychiatric treatment 
with behavioral therapy.”

In the future, Aurbach said 

she aims to better understand 
how FGF9 is functioning in 
more areas of the brain and 
whether FGF9 is working 
with or against other mol-
ecules in the brain to change 
behavior.

“If we can understand how 

FGF9 is involved in all areas 
of the brain, then we can build 
a much bigger picture of how 
we can develop a drug to tar-
get depression effectively,” she 
said.

client’s rights.

“We are very pleased with the 

settlement,” Gordon said. “It null 
and voids the findings against Mr. 
Sterrett and cleans his records 
against and removes the prior 
findings against him.”

The 
female 
student 
who 

claimed Sterrett engaged in non-
consensual sex with her said in a 

statement that by the University, 
by signing the settlement, is not 
following through on its com-
mitment to support survivors 
of sexual assault. She also cau-
tioned other students from going 
through the school’s Title IX pro-
cess.

“Worst of all, I have come to 

believe they do not care about 
individual 
students 
seeking 

help and are more concerned 
with producing the paperwork 
which demonstrates compliance 

with U.S. Department of Educa-
tion mandates,” the student said 
in a statement provided through 
her attorney, Douglas Fierberg. 
“With the multiple efforts and 
initiatives the University has 
undertaken 
and 
administra-

tors have espoused, the big-
gest threat on campus has now 
become the Title IX Sexual 
Assault Policy as implemented 
by the University.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said in an e-mail that 

students have a number of options 
for seeking support in the wake of 
a sexual assault, including strict-
ly confidential resources. 

“The University offers exten-

sive, 
research-informed 
edu-

cational programs designed to 
reduce sexual misconduct and 
increase reporting,” he wrote. 
“We strive to continually improve 
our processes to improve the 
experiences and outcomes for 
students who report sexual mis-
conduct to the University.”

A 

former reality TV star is the 
biggest name in news for the 
next Republican presiden-

tial 
nomination. 

On the other side, 
a socialist and a 
familiar face lead 
the way for the 
Democrats. Hill-
ary Clinton has 
been 
mired 
in 

controversy 
for 

the entire sum-
mer. Meanwhile, 
Bernie Sanders, a 
doggedly radical 
leftist, is gaining surprising trac-
tion in the age of big-money poli-
tics.

Sanders has raised over $15 mil-

lion dollars, and according to the 
New York Times, the average dona-
tion to Sanders’ campaign is a 
 

meager $31.30.

Sanders isn’t alone. Trump is also 

making waves on the right by prom-
ising to run his campaign without 
accepting any fundraising donations 
from lobbyists.

Since the 2010 Citizens United 

decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, 
corporations and super PACs have 
been pouring money into elections 
in ever-greater amounts. Unlim-
ited donations to campaigns by 
individuals and corporations alike 
is the law of the land. Quickly, the 
image of corporate lobbyists, sitting 
fingers-crossed in each politician’s 
office while dressed like old-fash-
ioned mobsters ready to make “an 
offer you can’t refuse,” entered the 
 

American consciousness. 

President Barack Obama made 

headlines with his grassroots fund-
raising success in 2008, but he wasn’t 
a candidate dedicated to shun-
ning the entire established order 
of things like Sanders and Trump 
 

have become. 

In a post-Citizens United world, 

conventional wisdom says those who 
don’t sell out to corporate interests 
don’t stand a chance at winning an 
elected office. Politicians themselves 
have played into their natural role, 
following the money and, in the 
worst cases, allowing their careers 
to be held aloft by the money of 
 

the rich.

Without the support of big money, 

it’s awfully hard to win an election.

Except for the fact that now sum-

mer is over, and we’re still waiting 
for the other shoe to drop on the 
would-be punchline that was sup-
posed to be Trump’s campaign. 
Like Sanders, he is bucking the 
support of super PACs. Trump’s 

own private wealth makes funding 
a campaign much easier. Nonethe-
less, Trump is a renegade.

While Sanders relies on his mid-

dle-class supporters and a budget-
ed campaign to stay afloat, Trump 
is independently wealthy enough 
to finance his campaign without 
external support. Yet each has 
been, at to this point, successful, 
despite their intentional steps away 
from the traditional partisan scene.

As Americans, we laugh at the 

idea of an honest politician, which 
seems to us an apparent contradic-
tion. It’s what we would all love 
to see, but it doesn’t seem pos-
sible. Trump is an enigma, a man 
beyond 
understanding. 
But 
he 

finds himself aligned with Sanders’ 
 

hallmark activism.

The unlikely pair of opposites are 

each finding success. While Sanders 
is still behind Clinton by millions in 
fundraising, he is seemingly poll-
ing just as well in multiple early pri-
mary states. Trump, as mentioned, 
commands the GOP field. As often 
as the phrase “out of touch” has 
been thrown around among writ-
ers, Trump and Sanders are proving 
otherwise. It is the political machine 
itself that has run off the tracks laid 
by its constituents.

While it remains to be seen, Amer-

icans on both sides of the aisle believe 
Trump’s and Sanders’ promise of 
an honest campaign: one in which 
constituents won’t feel they have to 
worry about who lined their presi-
dent’s pockets for a free pass to influ-
ence future policy.

Sanders embraces the title “social-

ist.” Trump speaks openly about his 
wealth and his hair. They appear to 
be connecting to the public on a basic 
level of trust in the way most success-
ful, traditional bipartisan candidates 
have done. 

More than a desire for trust, by 

striving to keep super PACs out of the 
conversation, Trump and Sanders 
are empowering the individual voter. 
Knowing Sanders’ campaign sur-
vives on the donations from middle-
class supporters makes his strategy 
all the more significant the longer 
he stays relevant in the polls. His 
campaign is more of a direct prod-
uct of his popular supporters than 
 

any other.

Meanwhile, Trump is hacking 

through the tradition of neo-conser-
vatism with seemingly reckless aban-
don. The key issues he has brought to 
the spotlight surrounding immigra-
tion and tax reform are either in spite 
of himself or part of a cartoonish 
mastermind plan.

Either way, Trump and Sand-

ers are both succeeding, thanks 
in part to an anti-establishment 
message that meshes well with 
 

millennial culture.

It’s what Kanye West, self-pro-

claimed millennial and aspirant for 
the 2020 presidency, seemed to be 
channeling at certain points during 
his speech at the 2015 VMAs when 
he lashed out against the media’s 
manipulation of consumers, in a sim-
ilar way that politicians manipulate 
their voters.

“It ain’t about me,” West said. 

“It’s about new ideas, bro, people 
with new ideas, people who believe 
 

in truth.”

Any serious political forecaster 

would still say that Trump and 
Sanders are fringe candidates and 
that their aspirations for the White 
House will probably fall short. 
While that may prove true, they 
are each demonstrating a way of 
fighting conventional wisdom in 
ways similar to pop-culture icons 
like West, who have been met with 
 

thunderous applause.

West, with all the political quali-

fications of Trump, has somehow 
entered the summer circus of politics 
as well. It all seems too crazy. To this 
point, the most embattled people in 
this election have been longstanding 
fixtures in politics, like Clinton, and 
the parties themselves.

On one hand, it seems grotesquely 

American to be living in a country 
where this is all happening, like a 
 

cliché joke:

A businessman, a hippy and a 

singer walk into a bar … one of them 
becomes president. HA HA HA.

I assume Kanye will quickly drop 

out, but who’s to tell? Many said the 
same about Trump. It’s all too sur-
real, a total sea-change from what 
we’re used to in politics. As elec-
tion time draws nearer, maybe a 
sense of normalcy will return. But 
a political revolution has been the 
game all along — Sanders even says 
 

so outright.

Now, new millennial ideals can 

be expressed to help shape the evo-
lution of politics.

If politicians can find a way to 

run successful campaigns without 
big money, and if millennials do 
indeed subscribe to the idealistic 
beliefs of the Kanye doctrine, the 
old curmudgeons at party head-
quarters might start losing ground 
that newer generations could use to 
make room for change.

F

or the past half year, the Iran nuclear 
deal has been discussed to the point of 
nausea. The agree-

ment has been brought to a 
TV near you because top-
ics like “nuclear weapons” 
and “Middle East policy” 
always make noise. So when 
they collide, the American public wants to 
know. But what is it about the particulars of 
the Iran deal that render it so controversial?

Negotiators from six world powers laid 

out a deal to cut off almost every pathway for 
Iran to construct a nuclear bomb. First, Iran 
must give up almost 97 percent of its enriched 
uranium and can only enrich their remaining 
stockpile to a measly 3.67 percent. (To build 
a nuclear bomb, uranium must be at least 90 
percent enriched.)

Furthermore, 
Iran’s 
centrifuges 
(the 

machines that can be used to mechani-
cally construct a bomb) have been cut from 
20,000 to 6,104, and Iran is inhibited from 
building new models. Finally, the origi-
nal core reactor manufacturing weapons-
grade plutonium (another element crucial 
to nuclear bomb construction) will be 
 

inoperable and its plutonium exported.

In return, economic sanctions crippling 

Iran will be lifted, opening their market to 
the world economy. The International Atomic 
Energy Agency will keep a close watch over 
Iranian nuclear development, and if they sus-
pect, for any reason, Iran is building a bomb, 
the sanctions will “snap back,” or be rein-
stated. The deal will likely delay a nuclear 
bomb for 25 years. Without a deal, some anal-
ysis indicates Iran could construct a bomb 
 

within months.

The deal appears agreeably straightfor-

ward: There is little possibility of a nuclear 
Iran and relief from economic sanctions will 
improve conditions for Iranian citizens in the 
long term. Seems like a win-win, right?

The deal’s haters don’t think so, and the most 

outspoken among them happen to be right-
wing Israelis and American Jews. Many who 
fall within this demographic feel that the Irani-
an nuclear deal will empower Iran economical-
ly and militarily, thereby jeopardizing Israel’s 
existence, as the nation is so often threatened 
by Middle Eastern leaders. But let me assure 
you, their fears are unwarranted.

Before I continue, I must quickly note here 

that I’m a Jewish American. I’ve had a Bar 
Mitzvah, graduated from my temple’s Hebrew 
school and volunteered in Israel. Additionally, 
I proudly call myself a Zionist — a supporter 
of Jews living in Israel. However, I, unlike too 
many supporters of Israel, do not believe the 
country will be extinguished and am critical of 
the country’s political elite.

Those least critical of Israel are those most 

afraid of losing it. Their insecurities case them 
to instinctively block deals like the one with 
Iran because any deal with the Middle East 
appears threatening. Ultimately, their fears 
cause them to prioritize security and inhibit 
them from fully evaluating their own leaders.

Part of the reason for this is because Iran 

nuclear deal haters feel they are in a world 
more similar to 1963, when Israel was con-

sistently attacked by sovereign nations, its 
infrastructure underdeveloped and its mili-
tary not one of the world’s best.

However, today’s Israel isn’t like that. 

In its current state, Israel is a fully devel-
oped country with a per-capita GDP of over 
$35,000. Israel’s citizens are college-educat-
ed at a rate second only to Canada, its tech-
nology and science sectors are among the 
world’s elite, and Israel has one of the world’s 
 

strongest militaries.

But, strategically, this is not how the 

Israeli right portrays itself. Constantly men-
tioning the Holocaust and anti-Semitism 
in his speeches, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu instills fear in the public in order 
to increase support for policies sometimes 
criticized for prejudice and racism. Citizens 
buy into his plan because the more fear-
ful Israelis become, the more security they 
desire. The more security they desire, the 
less sympathetic they are to issues regarding 
non-Israelis — particularly peace talks with 
Palestinians and other Arab (or Iranian) lead-
ers. The mindset with the Iran nuclear deal is 
 

no different.

Fears of Israel’s extinction have even spread 

to leftist American politicians. Jewish Repre-
sentatives like Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.), Nita 
Lowey (D–N.Y.), Steve Israel (D–N.Y.) and Ted 
Deutch (D–Fla.) are among those who have 
followed the Israeli right’s lead in opposing 
the Iran deal because of their panicked con-
stituents. They believe any deal with Iran is 
bad because it will lead to Israel’s destruction. 
 

Unfortunately, when people support policy 

decisions based on the fear of their own (or 
someone else’s) existential threat, it has serious 
consequences. First, it severely prioritizes the 
nation’s own rights over all others for fear of 
being wiped from the planet. Their chief con-
cern becomes survival, thereby diminishing the 
importance of all other “unthreatened” lives. 
Second, because citizens are overly concerned 
with their own safety, it allows representa-
tives to harvest more unchecked power. These 
supporters strive for personal security by any 
 

means necessary.

Consequently, this mindset overlooks two 

critical points of the way modern day nation-
alism operates: the nature of globalization, in 
which continuously more people are demand-
ing basic human rights, and the functioning 
of democracy, in which leaders must be held 
accountable for their actions.

But many Iran nuclear deal haters don’t 

uphold these standards. They prioritize secu-
rity over peace, and safety over democracy. But 
when policy leaders don’t prioritize peace, they 
create more enemies and jeopardize security; 
and when one fails to pursue a democratic life-
style, one sacrifices civil liberties and poten-
tially infringes upon the rights of others.

These opponents of the Iran nuclear deal 

are concerned about the safety of Israel and 
become unwilling to accept agreements even 
when it’s in their best interest. They act this 
way because they are afraid. Their fear is 
 

my concern.

HOLLY RIDER-MILKOVICH | VIEWPOINT

Though individual experiences vary, two 

decades of research make it clear that sexual 
assault survivors are more likely to experi-
ence better outcomes in the legal and medical 
systems when they are supported by well-
trained, confidential advocates. They also 
report experiencing less isolation, anxiety 
and re-victimization when they work with 
confidential advocates.

And yet, our own campus climate survey of 

students tells us that, right now, fewer than 5 
percent of students share information about 
sexual misconduct with the University. Even 
more heartbreaking, the majority of students 
who experience a sexual assault tell no one 
about what happened to them. 

The University of Michigan is not unique 

in this regard, and other studies report that 
sexual assault survivors on college campuses 
are more likely to stay silent than share their 
information with anyone. 

If we care about the lives and futures of 

sexual assault survivors, we must do every-
thing in our power to reduce their isolation 
and increase their access to trained, experi-
enced and confidential advocates.

At the University’s Sexual Assault Preven-

tion and Awareness Center, we are committed 
to empowering survivors by providing clear 
and accurate information about their options 
in a confidential environment, and supporting 
their decisions — whether that be to formally 
report the experience to the University, to law 
enforcement or to not report their experience 
to either entity. 

We walk with survivors along the path 

that they choose, offering encouragement, 
resources and support at each step. We do not 
share any information with other officials at 
the University, or take any action, unless given 
explicit direction to do so by the survivor.

If someone you love is sexually assaulted, 

we strongly encourage you to listen to them 
without judgment, believe them and affirm 
their experience, support their decisions and 
connect them to trained confidential advo-
cates like those at SAPAC.

We are available for students, staff, faculty 

and parents 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
at 734-936-3333.

Holly Rider-Milkovich is the director of 

the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness 

Center at the University of Michigan.

Sexual assault survivors best 

served by confidential advocates

TV COLUMN

TV, where love 

goes to die

By CHLOE GILKE

Daily TV Columnist

Warning: this column contains 

major 
spoilers 
for 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy” 
and 
“The 
Mindy 

Project.”
I

f someone were to pick 
up a scalpel and open up 
my chest, he’d discover 

a skippy, sloshy heart. A 
surgeon would take one look 
and say, “That girl’s heartbeat 
is more irregular than a 
German verb conjugation,” 
and the nurses would groan 
and contemplate leaving this 
hospital and finding one where 
the doctors tell better jokes. 
To the layman, however, my 
heart’s most unusual quality 
would be the hundreds of little 
signatures decorating the atria 
and ventricles — Jim and Pam, 
Scully and Mulder, Alicia and 
Will, Kurt and Blaine.

I have a shipper’s heart. Since 

I was a little girl watching Doug 
and Carol on “E.R.” through 
the crack in my parents’ closed 
door (they thought “E.R.” was 
not an appropriate show for 
a 
seven-year-old, 
and 
they 

were probably correct), I’ve 
cultivated an appreciation for 
the thrill of will-they-or-won’t-
they 
relationships. 
There’s 

something so rewarding about 
following seasons and seasons 
of a show and anticipating the 
ignition of romance, waiting 
and waiting until some far-off 
season finale when those two 
will finally freaking kiss.

But what comes after that 

magical kiss? A relationship, 
a.ka. the shipper’s ultimate 
nightmare. It seems paradoxical 
that someone who loves TV 
couples would feel so negatively 
about … actual TV couples. 
But 
really, 
my 
hesitation 

makes 
sense. 
Relationships 

are 
terminally 
undramatic. 

Once the characters commit, 
fans can look forward to an 
inexhaustible stream of dates 
and smiles and sex and fights 
and tears as the ship reaches 
its endgame. It’s possible for a 
combination of these actions 
to be compelling — romantic 
comedies work so well as 
movies because the characters 
can have a fight and make up, 
and then the credits can roll. 
Unfortunately, TV shows rarely 
end when it’s convenient for 
the story. “Bones” is still on TV 
because people still care about 
Booth and Brennan, and for 
every person who cares, there’s 
another million dollars in the 
pocket of some FOX network 
executive.

If I consider all the pairings 

I’ve loved on TV, I’d be hard-
pressed to find one that didn’t 
turn sour somewhere along the 
line. Time, the very thing that 
makes following TV couples 
such a gratifying experience, 
is also capable of sinking a 
ship faster than a surprise 
courtroom shootout. All those 
beloved names tattooed on 
my heart read like epitaphs 
on 
a 
gravestone, 
memories 

of pairings that were great 
until somebody died or the 
relationship 
eroded 
into 

something so droll I’d wish 
somebody would die and liven 
things up.

Derek 
and 
Meredith 
on 

“Grey’s 
Anatomy” 
are 
an 

archetypal case of a great pair 

turned awful. In the early 
episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy,” 
Derek Shepherd was a knight 
in shining navy scrubs who 
mentored new intern Meredith 
through the crazy halls of 
Seattle Grace hospital (and did 
a lot more than mentoring in 
the on-call room). But Derek 
was married and trying to 
work on patching things up 
with his icy wife, which meant 
that Mer would have to move 
on and accept that Derek was a 
fantasy. He’d never choose his 
sad mistress over his gorgeous, 
successful wife — except that 
he did. Derek and Meredith got 
married, had babies and inched 
toward stagnation as the show 
dragged onto its 11th season. 
I stopped watching around 
season eight, but I jumped 
back in last winter when I felt 
a fleeting pang of nostalgia for 
my beloved MerDer.

On 
Apr. 
23, 
2015, 
an 

Entertainment Weekly article 
about 
Patrick 
Dempsey’s 

departure 
from 
“Grey’s” 

leaked just hours before the 
penultimate 
episode 
of 
the 

season. I read the headline and 
immediately gasped, clicked out 
and decided immediately that 
I was done watching “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” I read my friends’ 
lamentations on Twitter: Derek 
was in a terrible car accident, 
somehow lived through the 
injuries and died at the hands 
of a hack surgeon. His demise 
dragged out over the course of 
an entire episode, punctured 
by cruel stabs of hope that were 
ultimately a middle finger to the 
viewers who grew to care about 
Derek in the 11 years he graced 
“Grey’s.” Just like Denny, Henry, 
Mark and George before him, 
Derek was ultimately a pawn 
for the show, more valuable 
as a ratings-bait corpse on the 
table than a dynamic, living 
character. “Grey’s Anatomy” 
delivered seven languid seasons 
of MerDer dates, smiles, sex, 
fights 
and 
tears, 
stringing 

viewers along only to punch 
viewers with the reveal that 
Derek Shepherd is dead, and so 
is TV romance.

TV shippers can also face 

strife more tragic than death. 
For many couples, the simple 
act of staying together kills the 
romance. “The Mindy Project” 
used to be one of my favorite 
shows, 
because 
Mindy 
and 

Danny were such an exceptional 
couple. 
In 
the 
beginning, 

Danny was highly unlikeable, 
ridiculing Mindy’s curves and 
bubbly personality and treating 
her like an insubstantial ditz. 
The two had chemistry, but in 
the same vein as Daniel Cleaver 
and Bridget Jones — the kind 
of chemistry that might lead 
to a volatile, doomed courtship 
before she finds someone nicer 
who will appreciate her spunk. 
“The Mindy Project” surprised 
me by spinning Danny from 
handsome 
scoundrel 
to 

romantic 
hero, 
redeeming 

him 
with 
deft 
character 

development 
and 
genuine 

change. Suddenly, he was good 
enough to deserve Mindy’s 
attention, and the show evolved 
into a close approximation of 
movie rom-com cuteness and 
magic.

But of course, this is TV, 

and every flame of a good 
couple is doomed to burn out 

spectacularly. 
For 
Mindy, 

the 
deciding 
tragedy 
was 

an ill-timed pregnancy. The 
pregnancy 
exposed 
cracks 

in 
Mindy 
and 
Danny’s 

relationship, but these struggles 
were a far cry from the frothy 
Bridget Jones-style romance 
“Mindy” delivered in earlier 
seasons. Mindy struggled with 
whether to prioritize her career 
or the baby, Danny balked at 
the idea of his conservative 
Catholic mother meeting the 
unapologetically nontraditional 
Mindy, and Mindy resented 
that Danny kept making her 
the villain. Mindy hoped for 
marriage, while Danny shirked 
commitment. Suffice it to say 
that 
will-they-or-won’t-they-

get-married is not enough to 
keep the show’s romantic heart 
beating strong. Dismal ratings 
following the marriage plot 
were enough to get series was 
canceled on FOX, but “Mindy” 
will return for a fourth season 
on Hulu this fall. I’m not sure 
I’ll be watching.

Having a shipper’s heart 

is a blessing and a curse. I’m 
glad that I’m wired as a true 
romantic, and can appreciate 
blossoming love on TV and 
in real life. I’m glad that I can 
rewatch scenes from the first 
season of “Glee” and still smile 
at Finn and Rachel singing 
“Faithfully” at their regional 
competition, and I’m glad (and a 
little embarrassed) that I can go 
back to Nick and Jess’s first kiss 
on “New Girl” and still surprise 
myself by squealing in my empty 
living room. I’m glad I can 
watch shows like “Looking” and 
“Jane the Virgin” and feel the 
beginnings of another favorite 
couple etching themselves into 
my affections. TV romance has 
let me down a thousand times 
— but I’m still hopeful that one 
day, somebody will get it right.

Wife.” To express your concern,

‘Enemies’ plays nice

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

1968 was a seminal year in 

American politics: Bobby Kennedy 
and Martin Luther King Jr. were 
assassinated 
within a few 
months 
of 

one 
another; 

Richard Nixon 
was elected the 
37th President 
of the United 
States; and, last 
but 
probably 

least, 
ABC 

News 
hosted 

William 
F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal 
participated in a series of debates 
backgrounded by the lily-white 
Republican Convention and the 
brutality of the Chicago P.D. at its 
Democratic counterpart. 

“Best of Enemies,” the lively, 

skillfully 
crafted 
creation 
of 

directors Morgan Neville and 
Robert Gordon, documents the 
histories of the debate and its 
combatants. ABC News developed 
the debates out of economic 
necessity. The network was a 
perpetual bronze medalist in 
a three-horse race, lacking the 
stalwart to attract regular viewers 
that both NBC and CBS had in 
Chet Huntley and David Brinkley 
and Walter Cronkite, respectively. 
Thus, they put all their money 
on an unlikely but provocative 
winner, but their gamble paid off. 

William F. Buckley, Jr. was the 

founder of the highly influential 

National Review and the St. Paul 
of the Neoconservative movement. 
He thought Gore Vidal, and 
his best-selling novel about the 
titular transgender woman Myra 
Breckinridge, Satan. And vice 
versa. After being hired, Buckley 
said he would not debate any 
Marxists. Or Gore Vidal. 

So, of course, ABC hired him.
Well-practiced in arrogance 

and wit, Buckley and Vidal were 
just close enough in their effete 
affectations and just far enough in 
their cultural and political views to 
light the spark of a television bomb. 
Both were aristocrats, but also 
distanced from the aristocracy. 
They spoke in “languid, patrician 
tongues,” as Buckley’s surviving 
brother summed it up, gilded by all 
the benefits of their class. Buckley 
went to Yale, but Vidal — who 
attended prestigious prep schools 
— had the sea as his Harvard and 
his Yale. 

But, most importantly, they 

were respected and influential 
intellectuals of their day. It is the 
most startling anachronism of the 
film. “Best of Enemies” harkens 
back to a day when (some) leading 
intellectuals frequented television. 
It also reveals how ineffectual of 
a format television is for nuanced 
intellectual 
debate. 
Television 

adores the sound bite and the clip. 
Ephemerality is its fuel. So, for 
men who write 600-page novels, 
television is bound to fail.

The 
Buckley-Vidal 
debate 

was not just a political battle, 
but a cultural one in the massive 
cultural warzone of the ‘60s. Their 

debates were a contemptuous 
conflagration that reached its 
incendiary 
apotheosis 
in 
one 

infamous moment: In a battle 
of skilled and savage wits, Vidal 
provided a fatal sting by calling 
Buckley a “pro- or crypto-Nazi.” 
Buckley’s 
response 
was 
the 

original “George Bush doesn’t care 
about Black people” moment: he 
leaned toward Vidal with absolute 
hatred, cracking the placidity of his 
aristocratic facade, and said: “Now 
listen, you queer. Stop calling me 
a crypto-Nazi or I’ll sock you in 
the goddamn face and you’ll stay 
plastered.”

In the aftermath, Vidal cannot 

contain his glee, nor Buckley his 
devastation. Vidal coaxed him into 
self-mutilation, and he obliged. 
Although Buckley would continue 
to have a successful career (he was 
influential in landing the Messiah 
of the Neocons in the Oval Office), 
the moment would linger within 
him 
with 
great 
regret. 
The 

Buckley-Vidal debate would spill 
over into multiple Esquire articles 
and subsequent litigation. 

One of the documentary’s main 

arguments is that the Buckley-
Vidal debate laid the foundation for 
modern network news television, 
that it was the progenitor of the Bill 
O’Reillys and Sean Hannitys of the 
world. This is a slightly hyperbolic 
claim; television was headed in this 
direction from the beginning. But 
if the Buckley-Vidal debate didn’t 
breed contemporary talking-heads 
television, it undoubtedly made 
the soil more fertile and the field 
more vast.

‘Go Set a Watchman’ 
is OK as a standalone

By ALEX BERNARD

Daily Community Culture Editor

All right, two things.
1. The publication of this book. 

Harper Lee is a sight and hearing-
impaired 
89-year-old 
stroke victim. 
In November 
2014, 
her 

protector, her 
sister 
Alice, 

passed 
away. 

Since 
then, 

her 
accounts 

have 
been 

taken over and seen after by the 
same woman who “discovered” 
the manuscript of “Go Set a 
Watchman.”

Whether or not Ms. Lee 

gave 
publication 
consent 
or 

was even in a position to give 
definitive consent is unclear at 
best. At worst, as Joe Nocera 
of The New York Times wrote, 
“...the publication of ‘Go Set a 
Watchman’ constitutes one of 
the epic money grabs in the 
modern history of American 
publishing.” You can read more 
about the novel’s unsettling road 
to publication in Nocera’s article 
and by reading any review of the 
book.

2. According to Ms. Lee’s 

former editor, Tay Hohoff, “Go 
Set a Watchman” is the first 
draft of the book that would later 
become the classic race novel, 
“To Kill a Mockingbird.” In 
fact, Hohoff described “Go Set a 
Watchman” as “more a series of 
anecdotes than a fully conceived 
novel,” but that “the spark of a 
true writer flashed in every line.” 
Indeed, many passages from 
“Mockingbird” are replicated in 
“Watchman,” of which you can 
read more about at qz.com.

With these facts in mind, we 

belatedly review the book. Not 
because we approve of the way 
Ms. Lee’s work has been treated, 
but because “Watchman” has two 
covers and pages in the middle, 
and so it should be discussed. 
Onward.

“Watchman” 
takes 
place 

during the civil rights movement 
and follows Jean Louise “Scout” 
Finch as she returns to Maycomb 
two decades after the events of 
“Mockingbird.” In the novel, 
we’re re-introduced to Calpurnia, 
Uncle Jack, Aunt Alexandra and 
Atticus and meet Henry “Hank” 
Clinton, a young 30-something 
local lawyer/war hero/Maycomb 
darling who’s been pining after 
Jean Louise since his senior 
dance. Immediately, the novel 
adopts a grim tone when we learn 
that Jem, Scout’s brother, passed 
away some years ago.

Hohoff was exactly right when 

she said that Ms. Lee showed 
“the spark of a true writer” in 

“Watchman.” What the novel 
lacks in focus, it makes up for in 
depth. Ms. Lee’s descriptions of 
Maycomb, while ill-placed, are 
specific and clever. Told through 
a somewhat limited third person, 
Jean Louise’s observations are a 
bright spot, exhibiting glimmers 
of 
that 
unique 
perspective 

from 
which 
“Mockingbird” 

was written. Ms. Lee colors 
Scout with a shade of cynicism, 
carefully coated over a youthful 
optimism that rings true in her 
attitude and her humor:

“Her favorite game was golf 

because its essential principles 
consisted of a stick, a small ball, 
and a state of mind.”

Unfortunately, 
where 

“Watchman” swerves off course 
are the exact places where 
“Mockingbird” earned its status 
as a classic. Characters, while not 
entirely flat, are predictable and 
insincere. Like politicians, you 
know what they’re going to say 
and you know it’s (usually) going 
to be condescending.

Not 
to 
suggest 
that 
an 

unlikable character can’t be an 
important or a well-developed 
one, 
though 
most 
of 
the 

characters in “Watchman” do 
deserve a brick in the face. But 
that fact alone doesn’t make the 
book not-so-great.

What makes the book not-

so-great is a lack of cohesion 
and a fumbled approach to a 
significant question: How do you 
deal with the fact that someone 
you love has done (or is doing) 
something utterly, unfathomably 
unforgivable? Is it unforgivable? 
Or is it merely reprehensible?

I’ll explain.
At the book’s halfway point, 

Jean Louise sees her father 
Atticus at the Maycomb County 
Citizens’ Council, i.e. a white 
supremacy meeting. Their goal: 
Combat desegregation. Resist 
the Supreme Court and the civil 
rights movement.

This scene, perhaps above 

any 
other, 
highlights 
the 

ocean of difference between 
“Mockingbird” and “Watchman.” 
Jean Louise, after seeing her 
father 
as 
a 
Council 
board 

member, mistily remembers how 
he used to be, how she’d thought 
of him before this moment: 
“The one human being she had 
ever fully and wholeheartedly 
trusted.” To Jean Louise, Atticus 
“had 
betrayed 
her, 
publicly, 

grossly, and shamelessly.”

But 
before 
you 
too 
take 

up arms against a fictional 
character, remember: This is 
a different Atticus, a man who 
no longer exists or acts in the 
interest of a novel like “To Kill a 
Mockingbird,” but exists in “Go 
Set a Watchman” one moving 
part in a machine with different 
priorities. 
Those 
priorities 

demand that a hero be villain. 
But we lose that hero for the good 
of a book we don’t love, and that 
hurts.

But no matter how much 

we 
think 
about 
reading 

“Mockingbird” in eighth grade 
or watching ol’ Gregory Peck 
lean back in his rocking chair 
to spin a monologue, Atticus’s 
racism is not poor writing. It’s a 
complication of something that 
matters a great deal to a great 
many. But it’s not inherently bad.

Other stuff is.
Where a later draft might’ve 

navigated 
Jean 
Louise’s 

corrupted 
idolization 
of 

Atticus with a certain degree 
of misdirection, “Watchman” 
plows full steam ahead, like a 
train hitting a brick wall. In 
the final third, Jean Louise 
has three separate, yet nearly 
indistinguishable conversations 
with Uncle Jack, Henry and 
Atticus. The talks are harsh 
and difficult. At one point, she 
screams at Atticus for not raising 
her like a bigot, for not bringing 
her up in prejudice, for not letting 
her be ignorant, dumb, happy. In 
moments like these, one sees the 
seeds of brilliance that would 
later grow into “Mockingbird.” 

But 
these 
climaxes 
are 

repetitive, full of ramblings 
and intangible debates. The 
result is a numbing series of 
chapters that could’ve been 
better spent with action and 
concrete stakes.

Where 
“To 
Kill 
a 

Mockingbird” soars in its pace, 
action and concision, “Go Set 
a Watchman” is in need of 
grounding, especially in its 
final third. It’s got the pieces, 
the wit and something to talk 
about, but it’s too shapeless 
to stand on its own legs. 
“Watchman” is a compelling 
read with a compelling voice, 
but, ultimately, a first draft. 
Worth reading, yes. Worth 
re-reading, no.

But 
can 
“Watchman” 

tarnish Harper Lee’s legacy? 
I doubt it. It’s the first pass at 
the work that would become 
one of the capital-G Greatest 
novels in American literature. 
For that reason alone, “Go 
Set a Watchman” is worth 
every page, every word, every 
moment of your time. It is an 
artifact, and like any artifact, it 
should be studied.

start in series debut

BOOK REVIEW

Comedy Central 
host brings smart 
humor to network 

TV

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

In recent years, late night 

TV has undergone a paradigm 
shift, 
with 
longtime 
hosts 

departing and 
new 
blood 

livening up the 
landscape.

NBC 
has 

seen 
Jimmy 

Fallon, 
with 

his 
open 

demeanor and 
viral-friendly 
segments, 
successfully 
reinvigorate 
“The 
Tonight 

Show” 
after 

taking 
the 

reins 
from 

Jay Leno in 2014, and Fallon’s 
replacement, Seth Meyers, has 
experienced 
growing 
pains 

with a more traditional “Late 
Night” format.

Meanwhile, Meyer’s 12:30 

p.m. rival, “The Late Late 
Show” ’s James Corden, only 
took over for Craig Ferguson 
six months ago. Taking a 
page out of Fallon’s playbook, 
Corden has adjusted well to 
the position with a laid-back 
persona and atmosphere.

Now with David Letterman’s 

exit from “The Late Show,” the 
world of late night variety has 
been altered yet again with the 
debut of Stephen Colbert as the 
show’s new host.

Colbert is himself a part of 

another late night exodus — 
this time at Comedy Central — 
that saw the departure of “The 
Daily Show” ’s Jon Stewart and 

the subsequent rise of Larry 
Wilmore and Trevor Noah, 
replacing Colbert and Stewart, 
respectively.

Known 
for 
his 
satirical 

skewering 
of 
Republican 

pundits 
on 
“The 
Colbert 

Report,” 
there’s 
been 

speculation 
about 
how 

Colbert will adjust his acerbic 
personality to fit “The Late 
Show.” 
While 
Colbert 
has 

removed some of the more 
extreme elements of his former 
shtick, 
he 
maintains 
the 

personality that endeared him 
to so many on his former show. 
The man’s played-up egomania 
is readily apparent in the 
renovated Ed Sullivan Theater 
with Colbert’s face enshrined 
in a faux-stained glass ceiling. 
In 
addition, 
Colbert 
still 

isn’t afraid to throw punches 
on political targets, jabbing 
Donald Trump and Hillary 
Clinton, in his first week on 
the job.

Sketches and a surreally 

comedic tone round out the 
hour. In the first episode, 
Colbert argues with a cursed 
amulet over product placement. 
While some of these segments 
work and are mostly enjoyable, 
there’s also timing issues with 
some bits going far too long, 
notably when Colbert makes 
dictatorial declaration while 
wearing 
a 
Genghis 
Khan-

esque hat. More successful 
was the shorter pre-filmed, 
advertisement for “Yesterday’s 
Coffee,” featuring Colbert and 
Laura Linney (“The Truman 
Show”).

Musically, 
Colbert’s 
house 

band, Stay Human, led by Jon 
Batiste, brings a dancing-on-
the-piano energy to the early 
episodes. The big-name musical 

acts have brought a usual variety 
including Toby Keith, Paul Simon 
and Kendrick Lamar (the week’s 
highlight performance).

At the core of most late night 

programs are guest interviews, 
and glimmers of higher ambition 
mark these segments. While there 
are the usual celebrities (George 
Clooney, 
Scarlett 
Johansson 

and Amy Schumer), Colbert’s 
opening week was marked by the 
addition of writer Stephen King, 
CEO’s Elon Musk and Travis 
Kalanick, Presidential candidate 
Jeb Bush and Vice President Joe 
Biden. These guests bring a new 
spectrum of opportunity for 
Colbert, a chance to become the 
thinking man’s Late Night talk 
show.

Guests like these are rare 

on other shows but Colbert is 
making a point to have these 
types of guests become regulars 
as his show goes forward. But the 
content of these interviews are 
just as important as who Colbert 
brings. Questions on Bush’s 
political stances and the effect 
Kalanick’s Uber has on the taxi 
industry are necessary inquiries 
that won’t necessarily be asked 
by other network hosts. This 
isn’t criticism of the rest of late 
night television, but rather an 
observed need that Colbert can 
potentially fill.

Nowhere 
is 
this 
more 

apparent than Colbert’s must-
see 
interview 
with 
Biden. 

Touching on the tragedy of 
the death of Biden’s son, Beau, 
in June of this year, Colbert 
exemplifies how to handle a 
sensitive interview. As Biden 
talks 
about 
his 
son, 
there 

are a few moments when it 
looks like Colbert is ready to 
comment, holds back and let’s 
the Biden continue, improving 
the interview by, in a sense, 
doing nothing. Colbert, who 
lost his father and two brothers 
in a plane crash at age 10, is an 
empathetic host who still injects 
humor into the conversation 
when he asking Biden about his 
future plans.

Late 
night 
television 
is 

changing, and mostly improving 
— and Colbert’s new approach 
will 
hopefully 
continue 
to 

grow as the years go on.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Back-to-school jams

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

Welcome back, friends. While 

those four months of lovely sum-
mer bliss were much appreciated, 
I’m sure you’re just as thrilled as 
I am to wheeze your way to the 
fourth floor of Mason Hall or hunt 
down that paper you printed in the 
Fishbowl. The first few weeks of 
school often dictate how the rest of 
the semester goes, so let’s start this 
year right (or at least with minimal 
tears) with some new tunes to get 
that pep in your step.

Over the course of the summer, 

I have come across a few funky 
fresh, hip artists whose music 
make that walk to class just a bit 
more bearable.

First up is Coleman Hell, a 

Canadian 
producer/singer/song-

writer whose sound has trans-
formed from default electronic 
noise to alternative pop songs dur-
ing the last four years. By utiliz-
ing his raspy voice and weaving 
in syncopated beats, Hell creates 
an unconventional genre of dance 
music that is sure to have you nod-
ding along as you write that paper 
due in two hours. His most recent 

singles, “Thumbalina,” “Take Me 
Up” and “2 Heads,” embody this 
new shift in Hell’s music and have 
rightfully gained popularity on 
social media with “2 Heads” com-
ing in second for Alt Nation’s Song 
of the Summer.

Shifting away from the world 

of alternative pop, Odessa is a 
folk singer with little exposure 
but a lot of personality. Perfect 
for those rainy, overcast days 
(much like Saturday’s game day), 
Odessa’s bluesy introspective lyr-
ics transport you to a place far, 
far away from responsibilities 
and homework. After a near fatal 
bike accident inspired the bud-
ding singer-songwriter to pursue 
a solo career, Odessa has since 
traveled the world as a musician 
and part-time model and incor-
porates these experiences into 
her music. Though she travels 
now, most of her childhood was 
spent near the ocean and the 
swelling of the waves is evident 
in her pulsating music. With 
hushed reverb and echoing fal-
setto, Odessa is an artist to watch 
and to admire.

Sticking with the indie and 

adding some pop, Hippo Campus 

(I see what you did there) dishes 
out some nostalgic Sunday after-
noon music. Kick back, relax and 
allow this Minnesotan “kinda 
pop” band to clear your mind 
and fill it with upbeat guitars 
and catchy hooks. After receiv-
ing outpouring of support from 
the Twin Cities, Hippo Campus’ 
debut EP, Bashful Creatures is 
creeping its way onto Spotify 
playlists across the nation.

Finally, Vinyl Theatre moves 

back towards the same electronic 
dance genre as Hell, but adds its 
own ’80s twist to the sound. The 
four-man band is based out of 
Milwaukee and has been likened 
to bands like Two Door Cinema 
Club, Twenty One Pilots and the 
Killers. With lyrics like “Passion 
running wild / Dancing in denial 
/ We are the sum / The lifeblood 
of / The city’s lights,” Vinyl The-
atre creates a story of restless 
youth and endless future.

And now, armed with this 

music, I send you out into the 
world of deadlines, pop quizzes 
and essays. Get out there and get 
educated.

Happy vibes, everyone. You’ve 

got this.

“Like any 

artifact, it should 

be studied.”

interviews and 

solid jokes.

A long time coming

A

round 10:05 Saturday 
morning, two hours 
before kickoff, the first 

person inside the Michigan 
Stadium 
student 
section 
settled 
into his 
seat in the 
ninth row 
behind the 
north end 
zone. Nick 
Goldblatt 
had been to 
the stadium 
twice before — as a member of 
the Michigan State marching 
band.

Goldblatt studied history as 

an undergraduate at Michigan 
State, then graduated, took a 
year off and came to Michigan 
for a graduate degree in sport 
management. He sat almost 
entirely alone two hours before 
kickoff, appreciating the sight 
before him.

“It’s a huge milestone,” he 

said. “I’m excited to be a part of 
it. It’s going to be weird being 
here, but I’m excited.”

Goldblatt still carries his 

Michigan State ties — he left 
immediately after Michigan’s 
noon game against Oregon 
State to head to East Lansing 
for the Spartans’ 8 p.m. kickoff 
against Oregon. He’s been a 
Michigan State fan since 2002, 
when he moved to East Lansing. 
He remembers the first game 
he saw. “Oh, yeah,” he says. 
“(Michigan State) lost by a lot.”

Even he couldn’t help 

but make the trip for Jim 
Harbaugh’s home debut.

So he awoke at 6:30 a.m. 

Saturday in Lansing — no alarm 
necessary — and drove to Ann 
Arbor with his bicycle in tow, 
so he could bike back to his car 
and drive to Spartan Stadium 
in time.

“I’m so used to getting here 

so early,” said Goldblatt, 24. “I 
had to hype myself down so I 
could get to sleep for the past 
few days.”

Michigan fans have been 

hyping themselves up and down 
for eight and a half months. 
Harbaughmania ensued 
immediately after the coach 
was introduced on Dec. 30, 
though the Wolverine faithful 
have tried to temper their 
expectations after two coaching 
tenures gone wrong.

Saturday was no time for 

tempering. That can come later. 
This time, they came to see if 
their faith might just pay off in 
the end.

I

f Goldblatt is a Michigan 
Stadium rookie, Andrew 
Kanei is a veteran. Kanei 

began his fifth year in the 
student section Saturday. After 
four years in the undergrad 
aerospace engineering program, 
he is now in the graduate 
program, which means another 
full slate of games.

He, too, sat down in the third 

row on the 
20-yard line 
just after 10 
a.m. for the 
home opener.

“I kind of 

like getting 
into the 
stadium when 
it’s empty and 
watching it 
fill up,” Kanei 
said.

And fill up 

it did, for the first time in a 
while. Saturday’s attendance 
of 109,651 was higher than 
every game last season except 
the night game against Penn 
State, even with the capacity of 
Michigan Stadium decreased 
by more than 2,000 in the 
offseason.

Kanei has been to enough 

games to remember more 
highlights: the first night game 
against Notre Dame in 2011 that 
broke the attendance record, 
the second one in 2013 that 
broke it again and the field rush 
after the win over Ohio State 
in 2011.

He put Saturday’s home 

opener in the same category for 
one reason.

“This whole summer, I’ve 

been going crazy ever since 
Harbaugh got here,” Kanei said.

He was in good company 

Saturday in that respect. He 
sensed extra excitement on 
campus Saturday morning, with 
students gathering up their 
khaki pants and old-school 
block ‘M’ hats.

That excitement flooded 

into the stadium as Harbaugh 
received a huge ovation when 
he was introduced. It tapered 
when the Wolverines fell into 
an early 7-0 deficit and turned 
the ball over, giving Oregon 
State a chance to make it 14-0. 
But it returned when Michigan 
scored 35 unanswered points to 
end the game.

And here’s 

guessing it 
will be back 
Saturday 
when the 
Wolverines 
play UNLV.

“I think it’s 

going to be a 
new style,” 
Kanei said. 
“(Harbaugh) is 
bringing new 
cultures to 

Michigan football. He’s starting 
new things that are a part of his 
own.”

After the struggles of recent 

years, change was welcome to 
the fans at Michigan Stadium 
on Saturday.

* * *

I

t didn’t take long for Ann 
Arbor to become lively 
Saturday morning, but let 

the record reflect that there 
was a point when it was quiet. 
Just after 7 a.m., as ESPN’s 
“SportsCenter” aired live from 
outside Michigan Stadium, the 
streets were almost empty.

The students were still 

asleep or getting ready, and 
most everyone else was still 
en route to campus. The 
marching band’s last-minute 
preparations at Elbel Field 
filled the air as the sun crept 
over the horizon. Only a few 
runners, dog walkers and 
tailgaters were spread around 
campus.

Inside the stadium, former 

Michigan offensive lineman Jon 
Jansen did an early interview 
on SportsCenter in which he 
expressed his excitement for 
Harbaugh’s arrival. Though he, 

too, said he would be patient, 
he reiterated his belief that the 
Wolverines would finish 9-3 
this season.

A captain on the 1997 

national championship team, 
Jansen recalled the success 
of that team and called for 
a return to it. These days, it 
seems Michigan fans find 
themselves remembering the 
glory days, as if doing so will 
reincarnate them today.

At 7:40, Jansen walked 

down Hoover Street grinning 
from ear to ear. A man outside 
a parking lot across the road 
called out to him: “How ya 
doin’, Johnny?”

Jansen beamed. “Can’t wait 

for kickoff!” he said.

“Me too,” the man said. “I 

couldn’t wait for kickoff last 
Monday.”

The fans have been waiting 

since last December for 

Harbaugh’s return. They 
could only peek in the glass 
window as he conducted his 
introductory press conference. 
They could only wait as he took 
his team into the now-famous 
“submarine” for fall camp. 
They could only follow him on 
Twitter as he traveled from 
Michigan around the country, 
to Peru and then to Paris.

They counted down, from 

eight months to days to mere 
hours. Saturday morning, the 
gates to Michigan Stadium 
opened and the public-address 
announcer joined in. “Enjoy 
your day at Michigan Stadium,” 
he said. “Kickoff is in two 
hours.”

Then kickoff came, and it was 

worth the wait.

Michigan fans had long anticipated coach Jim Harbaugh’s home debut, and it came with a win on Saturday afternoon.

JAKE

“I had to hype 

myself down so I 
could get to sleep 
the past few days.”

Jalapeño and vanilla
O

n the day Jim Harbaugh 
returned to Michigan 
Stadium, the former 

quarterback and current coach 
of the 
Michigan 
football 
team gave 
109,651 fans 
something 
they had 
been missing 
for at least 
the last four 
years and 
maybe much, 
much longer: a boring win and 
an unfettered temper tantrum.

Sure, Wolverine fans have 

had tantrums themselves. 
They’ve lost their minds over 
confusing play calls and bizarre 
clock management and the 
occasional lapse that leaves just 
10 men on the field. But this 
was their coach, and this was a 
different type of meltdown. A 
good meltdown.

With a few minutes left 

in the second quarter and 
Michigan leading Oregon State 
10-7, redshirt junior cornerback 
Jeremy Clark leveled Beavers 
punter Nick Porebski near the 
sideline. The referee threw a 
flag. And Harbaugh went into a 
conniption.

You want fire? Jim 

Harbaugh’s got fire. He’s a 
mouthful of jalapeños washed 
down with a bottle of Sriracha. 
Gesturing wildly with his arms 
to indicate that Porebski was 
out of the pocket — and thus 
not afforded the traditional 
protection afforded a punter — 
Harbaugh lit into the officials. 
When his cries for explanation 
went unanswered, or simply 
didn’t satisfy him, he followed 
one up the sideline. He threw 
his folder behind him in 
frustration. And then he called 
a timeout so he could keep 
going.

“The way I understand the 

rule is, when he establishes 
himself a runner, he’s afforded 
the same protection the 
quarterback is when the 
quarterback’s running and 

outside the pocket,” Harbaugh 
said. “If a guy takes two steps, 
launches into him after the 
quarterback throws the ball, 
then that would be a penalty. 
That was: punt, hit. I just need 
an explanation as to why that 
was a penalty. Maybe I stand to 
be corrected.”

Porebski was out of the 

tackle box and had bobbled the 
ball, but forget for a minute 
the fact that Harbaugh was 
probably right about the call. 
That’s not what’s important. 
Instead, think about Jeremy 
Clark.

Michigan was up by just 

three points, and Clark’s 
penalty extended the Beavers’ 
possession and put them inside 
Wolverine territory. Think 
about what it means to be 21, to 
make a mistake that could have 
been disastrous and then to 
turn around to see your coach 
going berserk defending you.

“I know my coach is gonna 

fight for us, win, lose or draw,” 
said senior safety Jarrod 
Wilson. “Even if we were wrong 
about the call, he’s still gonna 
back us up.”

After that play, and two 

more punting debacles that 
caused the entire makeup of 
the game to change in the 
course of one minute, the 
Wolverines held the Beavers 
to eight yards the rest of the 
way. In the second half, Oregon 
State totaled just four.

“Players feed off coaches’ 

energy,” Wilson said.

But on Saturday, they 

weren’t distracted by it. On the 
field, Michigan was cool and 
collected. While their coach 
was explosive, the Wolverines 
were far from it. They just put 
their heads down and let their 
coach make the noise. They ran 
the ball 48 times for 225 yards 
and won the possession battle, 
38:01 to 21:29. They just went 
out and won.

With 12 minutes left in the 

game, and Michigan up 21, 
junior running back Derrick 
Green burst for a reasonable 
gain up the middle. But the 

play was called back for illegal 
substitution.

Over on the sideline, 

Harbaugh was in the referee’s 
ear right away, jumping up and 
down, pointing at the field. 
Michigan had the game well 
in hand, but its coach was still 
fighting. “Enthusiasm unknown 
to mankind” has been his 
personal mantra since he was 
just a kid, and he damn sure 
still lives it.

Asked after the game 

whether the players notice 
Harbaugh’s encounters with the 
officials, junior safety Delano 
Hill broke into a smile.

“It’s funny to see coach 

Harbaugh’s faces against the 
refs,” he said.

Harbaugh’s players know 

exactly what it’s like to get 
Harbaugh’s full tilt. Hill said 
Harbaugh is the same way in 
practice, getting “hot” when 
players make a mistake, which 
keeps the players on their toes.

But when that heat is coming 

to defend you, not berate you, 
you bet it’s funny to watch. It’s 
also motivating.

Whether it’s pumping up the 

crowd or throwing a folder or 
jumping up and down, he will 
argue for his players with a 
brand of ferocity that’s hard not 
to rally behind.

As for that other kind of 

meltdown — the brand induced 
by sloppy coaching — there 
were none of those on Saturday. 
A couple of turnovers, yes, but 
for the most part, Michigan 
was an efficient machine. If 
Harbaugh was a jalapeño on the 
sideline, the on-field product 
was vanilla.

Michigan pounded the ball, 

and it owned the possession. 
It was a well-executed version 
of the boring, power football 
team Michigan fans have been 
longing for since Lloyd Carr 
retired.

Boring, that is, except for its 

coach.

‘M’ finishes strong against Pitt

By DANIEL TACHNA-FRAM 

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan volleyball coach 

Mark Rosen’s message to his 
team Saturday night before its 
four-set victory over Pittsburgh 
was “learn as you go.” The 
undefeated 
Wolverines 
faced their 
toughest 
test of the season against an 
experienced Panthers team.

“We don’t have 30 matches 

we can watch on (Pittsburgh),” 
said junior middle blocker Abby 
Cole. “So we just learned as we 
went and we let up a little bit in 
set two, but we finished strong.”

After a hard-fought victory 

in the first set and a drubbing at 
the hands of the Panthers in the 
second, the Wolverines (9-0) 
came out in a new offensive 
system after the intermission.

Rosen switched from two 

setters to one, allowing him to 
add another player somewhere 
else on the court. The move gave 
Michigan either another attack 
option on offense or an extra 
back-row player to help shore 
up its defense and passing, both 
of which struggled in the first 
two sets.

The 
change 
became 
the 

difference in the game, as 
the Wolverines won the final 
two sets of the match in 
commanding fashion.

The first set quickly turned 

into an intense back-and-forth 
affair featuring 14 ties and seven 
lead changes. Trailing 18-17, 
Rosen took a timeout to try and 
slow Pittsburgh (7-2) down.

The break from the action 

worked, 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

captured 
the 
momentum 

immediately 
following 
the 

timeout and went on a 4-0 run 
to take a 21-18 lead. Pittsburgh 
battled back to tie the game at 
21, but Michigan answered with 
a 4-1 run to take the set, 25-22.

The 
Wolverines 
seemed 

primed to continue their surge 

straight through the second set, 
but the Panthers went on an 8-2 
run following a timeout to take 
a 9-7 lead.

They would never relinquish 

the lead, winning the second set 
by eight points, 25-17.

It was just the sixth set 

Michigan has lost all season, and 
the first in its last three games.

Though 

Michigan lost 
22 of the last 
32 
points 
in 

the second set, 
the Wolverines 
recovered 
in the third. 
Neither 
team 

could open up 
more than a 
two-point lead 
until Michigan 
went up 19-16 later in the set. 
The Wolverines continued to 
keep Pittsburgh at bay for the 
rest of the third set, taking it by 
a score of 25-22.

Sophomore 
opposite 
hitter 

Katherine Mahlke and senior 
setter Carly Warner both took 
full advantage of the increased 

roles they played under the new 
offensive system in the final 
two sets. Warner, who replaced 
freshman setter Maddy Abbott on 
the court to close out the match, 
provided assists on 19 of the 25 
points the Wolverines scored in 
the third set, accounting for all of 
Michigan’s kills.

“Nineteen kills is a lot of kills 

for one set,” 
Rosen 
said. 

“When you’re 
scoring 19 of 
your 25 points 
on 
flat-out 

kills, that’s a 
giant number. 
You’re 
normally 
going to get 
13-14 kills per 
set, so that 

means the offense was running 
really well.”

Warner served up seven of 

those 19 assists to Mahlke, who 
put on a dominant performance 
in the third set. At halftime, 
after deciding to switch to 
the 5-1 offense that featured 
Mahlke more heavily, Rosen 

challenged her to get more 
out of her spot. And she rose 
to the challenge. Mahlke led 
the Wolverines’ offense in the 
second half, recording eight 
kills while hitting .727.

Sophomore 
defensive 

specialist Caroline Knop put an 
exclamation point on the third 
set with her 13th kill of the 
night. Knop finished the match 
with a team-leading 17 kills.

This 
time 
Michigan 

successfully carried over its the 
momentum from its previous 
set victory. The Wolverines led 
nearly the entire fourth set, 
which was highlighted by an 
8-0 run. Cole finished the night 
and sealed the victory with her 
14th kill.

Despite its perfect start to 

the season, Michigan still feels 
it hasn’t peaked yet.

“What’s great is we could 

literally get so much better,” 
Knop said. “There’s so much 
room for improvement, and 
that’s why we’re so excited about 
this season and it’s fantastic. 
We have a legitimate chance to 
win a national championship.”

Wolverines sweep weekend

By MITCH BECKMAN

Daily Sports Writer

The weekend didn’t start off 

ideally for the Michigan field 
hockey team.

Taking 
on 
Vermont, 
the 

Wolverines found themselves 
down a goal just five minutes into 
the match, as the Catamounts 
converted their first shot of the 
game.

The deficit didn’t last long, 

and Michigan never looked back, 
cruising to a 3-1 win and giving 
up only one more shot the rest of 
the game.

Just 
10 
minutes 
after 

Vermont’s early score, fifth year 
senior MacKenzie Ellis broke 
through 
for 
the 
Wolverines 

(4-2) on a penalty corner. The 
initial shot was blocked, but 
the rebound careened through 
the air to the left side of the net, 
where Ellis managed to out-reach 
several Vermont defenders and 
knock the ball into the net for her 
first career goal.

The offense held near-constant 

ball possession, tallying 26 shots 
on goal and keeping constant 
pressure on the Catamounts, 
pushing the ball to the net at 
every opportunit. Meanwhile, 
a suffocating defense rarely let 
Vermont see the Wolverines’ half 
of the field.

The 
Catamounts 
kept 

Michigan at bay for most of the 

first half, keeping balls away from 
Wolverine forwards and batting 
away any pass that threatened 
in the scoring circle, with the 
exception of Ellis’ goal.

“Vermont came out sharp,” 

said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “We were on our heels 
and had to regroup after that first 
goal.”

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offense 
broke 

through. Michigan players were 
finding 
themselves 
open 
in 

the circle and getting sticks on 
loose balls. Courtney Enge and 
Shannon Scavelli added goals to 
take a 3-1 lead with 20 minutes 
left to play, and the final could 
have been far more lopsided 
if not for the acrobatics of the 
Catamount 
goalkeeper, 
who 

made 14 saves in the game.

“We needed more intensity in 

the second half,” Pankratz said. 

After two days of rest, the 

Wolverines faced off against 
Davidson on Sunday afternoon. 
The Wildcats clobbered Vermont 
8-1 on Saturday, and offered 
Michigan a stiffer test.

Michigan controlled the ball 

again from the get-go, keeping 
the ball in Davidson’s end for 
the first 20 minutes and taking 
a 1-0 lead on a penalty corner 
by sophomore midfielder Katie 
Trombetta.

Unlike the Vermont game on 

Friday, Davidson pushed back, 

using an opportunistic offense to 
create rushes and chances after 
Wolverine turnovers. However, 
the defense stayed strong and 
kept the Wildcats off the board 
until they converted a penalty 
corner as time expired.

At 
the 
64-minute 
mark, 

Scavelli struck for her second 
goal in as many games, finding a 
deflection from an outside shot 
right on her stick to the right 
of the Davidson goalie. Scavelli 
calmly slid the ball to the left side 
of the net, past the outstretched 
leg of the Wildcat goaltender.

Scavelli 
struck 
again 
30 

seconds later, this time launching 
a shot on the run from the top 
of the circle that soared over 
the outstretched glove of the 
Davidson goalie.

Michigan wasn’t done yet. 

Senior back Lauren Thomas 
pounded a penalty corner into the 
back of the net to give Michigan 
another goal just over a minute 
later, making it three goals in 
under two minutes. 

The sudden offensive outburst 

was a long time coming for the 
Wolverines, who tallied 48 shots 
in the two games but could only 
manage four goals before that 
stretch. With a major showdown 
against Penn State looming next 
Friday, the team did all it set out 
to do this weekend: get two wins, 
keep its momentum and build 
confidence.

FIELD HOCKEY

Michigan uses gritty 
performance in draw

Wolverines hold 
their own against 
No. 4 Maryland in 

College Park

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

When the Michigan men’s 

soccer team stepped into a 
boxing ring in College Park on 
Friday night, 6,294 fans wanted 
to see the 
Wolverines 
knocked 
out, 
like 

Rocky Balboa to Maryland’s 
Apollo Creed.

Michigan 
was 
ranked 

seventh in the Big Ten before 
the season. Maryland is the No. 
4 team in the nation.

Both teams went blow for 

blow with each other, going 
the distance in a 110-minute 
overtime battle. And both teams 
emerged battered and bruised 
with only one point to show for 
it.

“Very few teams in America 

are going to go to Maryland 
and get anything out of the 
game,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “For us go there 
with their depth, their quality, 
their culture, their tradition, 
their fan base and to get a point 
… we’re not overly pleased 
and we’re not over the moon. 
But we’re satisfied with the 
work we put in tonight, so it’s 
a deserved point, and (we’re) 
slightly disappointed it wasn’t 
more.”

Michigan (0-0-1 Big Ten, 

2-1-1 overall) left the grudge 
match with a 0-0 tie against the 
Terrapins despite playing with a 
one-man advantage for the final 
35 minutes of play.

In 
the 
75th 
minute, 

sophomore 
defender 
Billy 

Stevens jumped to challenge 

Maryland 
midfielder 
Jorge 

Calix for a 50-50 head ball. As 
Calix landed, he flung his arm 
backwards at Stevens, making 
contact with his elbow.

Stevens left the field bloodied, 

while Calix was given a red card 
for the transgression.

Up 
to 
that 
point, 
the 

Wolverines were threatening 
with momentum in their favor. 
They had earned three corner 
kicks and fired four shots on 
net, and looked significantly 
more comfortable combining in 
their attacking third.

After the red card, Maryland 

(0-0-1, 2-1-2) caught Michigan 
on its heels. The Terrapins 
controlled possession for the 
final 15 minutes of regulation, 
pushing 
several 
passes 
out 

wide 
before 
serving 
them 

into the 18-yard-box for shot 
opportunities. 
In the final five 
minutes alone 
Maryland 
midfielder 
Mael 
Corboz 

had two shots, 
took 
two 

corner 
kicks 

and 
earned 

a 
dangerous 

free kick at the 
18.

But 
prior 

to the incident with Stevens, 
the Wolverines found a way 
to outplay the fourth-ranked 
team in the nation. Maryland 
tries to beat its opponents in 
the opening 20 minutes by 
applying immense pressure and 
scoring goals to give a defensive 
cushion.

In the first half, however, 

Michigan applied a pressure 
of its own rather than electing 
to sit back and absorb the 
Terrapins’ attack.

Though 
senior 
midfielder 

James Murphy left the game 
in 
the 
10th 
minute 
with 

a 
lower-body 
injury, 
the 

combination of freshman Ivo 
Cerda, junior Brett Nason and 
redshirt sophomore Michael 
Kapitula were disruptive in the 
midfield, preventing Maryland 
from dictating the pace and 
establishing 
any 
consistent 

possession.

Daley said he was trying to 

force Maryland to play the ball 
directly from its defenders to 
its forwards, because he felt 
his back line would have the 
advantage at winning long balls 
out of the air.

“We didn’t want them to 

dictate play through their best 
players, which were (Corboz) 
and (Tsubasa Endoh),” Daley 
said. 
“Maryland 
is 
a 
top 

team. You’re not going to get 
everything right. The guys did 
a great job of weathering the 
storm when they needed to.”

The 
two 

overtime 
periods 
seemed 
to 
favor 

Michigan, 
as 
the 

Wolverines 
outshot 
the 

Terrapins, 5-1. 
But 
neither 

team found a 
way to break 
the stalemate 

before the final whistle.

Still, Michigan finished the 

game with an advantage in 
corner kicks (7-3) and shots (15-
12). Both teams combined for 34 
fouls, three yellow cards and a 
red card — a stat line that leaves 
no doubt about the matchup’s 
phsyicality.

While neither team could 

deliver 
a 
knockout 
punch, 

each had its fair share of blows 
landed. By the time the fight 
was over, Michigan — a team 
that was written off as an 
afterthought in the Big Ten — 
proved it could stand toe to toe 
with the best in the nation.

Fighting Irish 
stop Michigan

By SYED FAHD AHSAN

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s soccer 

team has had a tumultuous start 
to the season. Despite scoring 22 
goals and conceding just six, the 
Wolverines hold a mediocre 5-3 
record.

And 

when faced 
with their 
toughest challenge yet in No. 13 
Notre Dame (7-0-1), the obstacle 
proved too large to hurdle, as 
Michigan fell to the Fighting Irish 
on Sunday night, 2-0.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan 

paid tribute to the quality of the 
opposition following the loss.

“Let’s not forget Notre Dame 

are a great team,” Ryan said. 
“In all their games this season, 
they’ve only let in a total of 
15 
shots. 
(That’s) 
fantastic 

defending.”

The 
hallmark 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ season thus far has 
been their ability to set up shots 
and create scoring opportunities 
for themselves at any point in 
the game. But the Fighting Irish 
restricted them to just three 
shots in 90 minutes while testing 
Michigan with nine of their own.

Defense 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

problem.

“Our play in midfield was 

fantastic,” 
Ryan 
said. 
“The 

midfielders 
moved 
the 
ball 

around the field really well, and 
managed to get it to the forwards 
most of the time. But then we 
would lose possession. I need to 
work on our strikers holding the 
ball up the field.”

While 
Michigan 
struggled 

on offense, Notre Dame’s attack 
proved clinical. The Fighting 
Irish scored both goals in the 
opening 45 minutes.

The first goal came from a 

free kick. Though sophomore 

goalkeeper Megan Hinz kept 
defender Katie Naughton’s initial 
header out, she parried the ball 
into the path of forward Natalie 
Jacobs, who pounced on the 
rebound. The second goal rattled 
in off the near post, knocked in 
by forward Anna Gilbertson. The 
Wolverines’ best chance of the 
game didn’t come until the 40th 
minute, when senior midfielder 
Corinne Harris forced the Notre 
Dame goalkeeper into a diving 
save with a shot from outside the 
18-yard box.

The second half started with 

a Michigan substitution: Hinz 
was replaced with freshman 
goalkeeper Sarah Jackson, who 
had played just 24 minutes prior 
to Sunday. Jackson fared better 
than Hinz did, escaping the half 
without conceding a goal.

“After conceding two goals we 

needed a better performance in 
goal,” Ryan said. “Sarah did very 
well after coming on. It’s good to 
know we have someone who can 
come on against a top opponent 
and not give up a goal.”

Ryan acknowledged that Hinz 

had to deal with more pressure on 
her goal than Jackson did. Notre 
Dame played a brilliant first 
half and came into the second 
looking to hold on to its lead. The 
next 45 minutes featured the 
Fighting Irish defending deep 
and trying to catch Michigan on 
 

counterattacks. As a result, Notre 
Dame managed just three shots 
in the second half, compared to 
six in the first.

Given the way both Michigan 

keepers fared in the game, Ryan 
didn’t rule out the prospect of her 
earning the starting role later in 
the season.

“(Hinz) conceded one on her 

near post,” Ryan said. “I’ll have 
to go over the footage and review 
her performance, and then we’ll 
see from there.”

Early turnover 
changes game

Down 7-0 early, 
Michigan regains 
possession, scores 

35 unanswered

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The first turning point in 

the Michigan football team’s 
home opener Saturday against 
Oregon State came after just 
two minutes and 33 seconds.

After the Beavers rolled down 

the field for a touchdown in 
1:51 on their first drive, Oregon 
State’s Rommel Mageo sacked 
Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
Jake 
Rudock, 

forced a fumble and recovered 
it. That gave the Beavers, 
already ahead 7-0, a first down 
at the Michigan 24-yard line.

Most of the fans who came 

to Michigan Stadium arrived 
optimistic, and it was still 
early, but it didn’t take long to 
connect the dots. If the Beavers 
could score again in the first 
few 
minutes, 

they would be 
up 14-0 early. 
If they were 
up 14-0 early, 
they could run 
away with it. 
And 
if 
they 

ran away with 
it…

So 
the 

Wolverines 
relied on their 
defense for a stop. And the 
defense delivered.

“I think we were ready,” 

Wilson said. “As soon as they 
scored on us, I mean, we’re not 
perfect. They scored, everybody 
was relaxed and when they got 
the fumble, we weren’t down on 
ourselves, like, ‘Man, I gotta go 
out there again.’ Everybody’s 
ready to play football and cause 
turnovers.”

After an incomplete pass on 

first down, junior defensive 
end Taco Charlton stripped 
the ball from Oregon State’s 
Victor Bolden. The ball fell into 
the hands of Joe Bolden, who 
returned it 17 yards, giving the 
Wolverines plenty of room to 
settle in from there.

The defense caught a break, 

but it was the only one they 
needed all afternoon. They 
settled in after that turnover, 
never giving up another point.

“It’s 
really 
that 
simple,” 

Wilson said. “When you’re 
playing football, you kind of 
have adrenaline, you’re ready 
to play and you go out there 
and you forget what your actual 
key assignment is. I think that 
happened the first drive for a lot 
of guys. After that, we got those 
bugs out, and guys just settled 
in and played good football the 
rest of the game.”

Added Bolden: “I would say, 

as a defense, it’s awesome. It 
gets your blood pumping. It’s 
what you do. The reason you 
play defense is to get the ball 

back. When it comes down to 
it, when you get the ball back, it 
totally flips the momentum.”

The 
Wolverines 
stopped 

a 
third-down 
quarterback 

scramble just short on the 
next series, and a fourth-down 
screen pass just short on the one 
after that.

In the second half, they 

asserted 
their 
dominance, 

allowing zero passing yards 
and only one first down. Oregon 
State quarterback Seth Collins, 
after going 8-for-13 for 79 yards 
and a touchdown in the first 
half, was 1-for-3 in the second. 
The 
Wolverines 
eventually 

forced him out for backup 
Marcus McMaryion.

“He’s a freshman. I can tell 

that because if he feels any type 
of pressure or anything, he’s 
just going to automatically take 
off running,” Wilson said. “He’s 
not really going to go through 
his reads or anything.”

Michigan 
took 
away 
the 

running option too, though. 
After Collins’ 152 rushing yards 
in the season opener exposed 
him as a threat to scramble, the 

Wolverines 
clamped 
down on him, 
sacking 
him 

once 
and 

limiting 
him 

to 28 yards on 
11 carries.

“I thought 

that was the 
difference 
between 
the 

first 
quarter 

— the long drive they made 
— and some other drives that 
they had,” Harbaugh said. “We 
started getting some pressure 
on the quarterback.”

Though an Oregon State 

punt-team mistake gave the 
Wolverines a 10-point halftime 
lead, the game was still up 
for grabs. Michigan’s defense 
served as the dominating force, 
never allowing the Beavers to 
close the gap while the offense 
expanded the lead.

The Wolverines kicked a field 

goal on the first series of the 
second half. The defense forced 
a three-and-out, and when 
the offense gave the ball back, 
Oregon State was deep in its 
own territory. Then the defense 
forced another three-and-out — 
culminating in fifth-year senior 
linebacker Desmond Morgan’s 
third-down sack — and when 
the offense gave the ball back, it 
was 28-7.

Michigan led comfortably 

for the duration of the fourth 
quarter in a game when it 
was on its heels at the very 
beginning.

“I screwed up,” said senior 

linebacker Joe Bolden of the 
first drive. “I’ll be the first to 
admit I screwed up some big 
plays on the first drive. A lot 
of people probably noticed. It 
happens.”

The mistakes mostly came 

to an end after the first series. 
The ensuing three quarters of 
dominance erased them.

Five Things We Learned

Wormley makes 
impact on defense, 
Smith breaks out at 

running back

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan 
fans 
got 
all 

they could ask for Saturday. 
They 
saw 
Michigan 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh patrolling the 
sidelines in his first game 
coaching 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 

squealed with delight when the 
coach threw a temper tantrum 
and witnessed a dominant 35-7 
win.

The Wolverines improved on 

all of their problem areas from 
the season opener, and showed 
glimpses of improvements to 
come.

Here are five things we 

learned from Michigan’s first 
win under Harbaugh.

1. Chris Wormley should be 

a household name.

When the senior led the 

team in tackles in Michigan’s 
Spring Game, there was plenty 
of buzz about Wormley having 
a breakout season in the fall. 
Through 
two 
games, 
the 

defensive end has surpassed 
those lofty expectations almost 
as easily as he’s breezed past 
offensive linemen.

Wormley 
recorded 
three 

tackles for loss and a sack 
against Oregon State en route to 
setting a career-high in tackles 
for loss in a season with six — a 
total that leads the Big Ten. On 
a defensive front that looked to 
be one of the Wolverines’ top 
units before the season began, 
Wormley’s breakout start sends 
an added chill down opposing 
quarterbacks’ spines.

2. De’Veon Smith can be the 

go-to guy.

Every 
time 
the 
junior 

running back showed glimpses 
of being a go-to back in the past, 
Smith seemed to either take 
a step back, or another back 
would surge ahead of him on 
the depth chart. That changed 
Saturday, when Smith racked up 
three touchdowns and a career-
high 150 yards of offense.

Beyond the numbers, Smith 

looked ready in his second 
outing as the No. 1 back. After 
missing holes and failing to 
substantially 
contribute 
in 

the team’s loss to Utah, Smith 
bounced off defenders, broke 
tackles and improved his way 
down 
the 
field. 
Michigan’s 

running back concerns can be 
put to rest for now.

3. But he doesn’t have to be.

Though Smith looked poised 

to take control of the run game, 
his 
teammates 
weren’t 
far 

behind. The Wolverines ran the 
ball 48 times for 225 yards, and 
two backups — juniors Derrick 
Green and Ty Isaac — combined 
for 70 yards on 14 carries.

Some of that has to do with 

the development of the backs, 
but a large amount of credit 
is owed to the offensive line. 
With all five starters back from 
last season, the line showed its 
veteran poise, shaking early 
struggles before dominating the 
Beavers nearly every snap in the 
second half. Smith showed top-
back talent, but if he struggles 
next week, he has plenty of help 
behind and in front of him.

4. Special teams won’t lose 

games for Michigan anymore.

With a reignited program, 

droves of Michigan fans are 
coming out of hiding. They 
are welcomed back by the 
Wolverines with open arms 
and clean special teams. After 
sending 10 players out on punts, 
shanking easy field goals and 
doing practically nothing in 
the return game last season, 
Michigan 
showed 
signs 
of 

aptitude Saturday.

Freshman 
wide 
receiver 

Brian Cole came within inches 
of blocking Oregon State punts 
several times, and the added 

pressure kept the Beavers on 
their heels all game. Senior 
Kenny 
Allen 
has 
looked 

competent as a kicker, giving 
Michigan a failsafe if the 
offense stalls.

5. Bold Prediction: This 

will be Jake Rudock’s least 
productive 
game 
of 
the 

season.

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback’s 
second 
start 

managed to be both better and 
worse than his first. His yardage 
dropped from 279 to 180, he 
didn’t throw for a touchdown, 
but he also improved from the 
mistake-filled performance that 
doomed Michigan in Salt Lake 
City. His production took a hit, 
but his poise rebounded.

The Michigan coaching staff 

made it clear before the season 
that if the running game is 
working, the passing game will 
come second. However, Michigan 
likely won’t be as effective on the 
ground every week. Expect the 
passing game to improve, and 
expect Rudock’s production to 
matter a lot more down the road.

Good, bad and ugly: 
‘M’ 35, Oregon St. 7

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

After 
eight 
months 
of 

waiting, hype and expectations, 
Jim Harbaugh took the field as 
Michigan’s head football coach 
for the first time Saturday. And 
it was a game to remember.

Michigan struggled initially, 

but 
eventually 
trounced 

Oregon State, 35-7. The manner 
in which the team won was the 
biggest surprise of it all — with 
a power running game.

Here is a look at the good, 

the bad and the ugly from 
Harbaugh’s 
first 
win 
as 

Michigan’s coach:

The good

The Wolverines’ running 

game looked as it rarely has in 
recent years. Michigan rushed 
for 225 yards, led by junior 
running back De’Veon Smith, 
who scampered for 126 yards 
and three touchdowns.

The Wolverines rode Smith 

hard late in the game, and 
the offensive line improved 
as the game went on. The 
Beavers had little answer for 
Michigan’s run game. The 
offense resembled what fans 
expected 
from 
Harbaugh: 

run-heavy with contributions 
from multiple tight ends and 
fullbacks.

While the offense ran wild, 

the 
defense 
stood 
strong. 

Oregon State rushed for minus-
28 yards after the first quarter. 
After the Beavers started the 
game with a long touchdown 
drive, they did not muster a 
single score.

The defense’s play even 

necessitated an Oregon State 
quarterback change, but it 
was to no avail. Harbaugh was 
able to coast to his first career 
victory at Michigan.

The bad

By the end of the game, 

Michigan’s 
first-quarter 

misfortune had been rendered 

irrelevant. But for a moment, 
things looked bad for the 
Wolverines. Michigan allowed 
that 
opening-possession 

touchdown drive, and then 
followed it up by turning the 
ball over when fifth-year senior 
quarterback 
Jake 
Rudock 

was sacked and fumbled the 
football.

The 
game 
momentarily 

appeared to be in jeopardy 
as Oregon State took over 
possession on the Wolverines’ 
24-yard line with the chance 
to take a 14-0 lead. But then 
junior defensive end Taco 
Charlton 
stripped 
Beavers 

running back Victor Bolden, 
and senior linebacker Joe 
Bolden snatched it out of the 
air for Michigan.

In terms of football action, 

that was the end of the bad for 
the Wolverines. But Michigan 
junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis suffered a concussion 
in the second quarter and 
missed the rest of the game. His 
status is currently unknown. 
If he misses time, it could be 
troubling for the Wolverines’ 
secondary.

The ugly

Late in the second quarter, 

Oregon 
State 
punter 
Nick 

Porebski lined up behind the 
long snapper to punt. The play 
went smoothly, and he booted 
the ball inside Michigan’s five-
yard line.

But then a penalty on the 

Beavers nullified the play. The 
second attempt at the punt did 
not go as well. The snap sailed 
well over Porebski’s head, and 
the Wolverines took over on 
Oregon State’s three-yard line.

Harbaugh got into the action 

himself, arguing a roughing 
the punter call in the second 
quarter. He tossed his play 
sheet and kicked the air while 
he chirped at the referees.

It may have been ugly for the 

officials who had to listen to his 
complaining, but for Michigan 
fans, it was a beautiful sight.

FOOTBALL

“When they got 
the fumble, we 
weren’t down 
on ourselves.”
